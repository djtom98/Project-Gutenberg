A. Danziger I wrote in the year 1889 a story\r\nfounded on a German tale, which I called _The Monk and the Hangman\'s\r\nDaughter_. The story was tragic but I gave it a happy ending. Submitting\r\nit to the late Ambrose Bierce, asking him to revise the story, he\r\nsuggested the retention of the tragic part and so revised it. The story\r\nwas published and the house failed.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1900 a publisher desired to bring out the story provided I gave\r\nit a happy ending, I submitted the matter to Bierce and on August 21,\r\n1900, he wrote me a long letter on the subject of which the following is\r\nan extract:\r\n\r\n\'I have read twice and carefully, your proposed addition to _The Monk_,\r\nand you must permit me to speak plainly, if not altogether agreeably, of\r\nit. It will not do for these reasons and others:\r\n\r\n\'The book is almost perfect as you wrote it; the part of the work that\r\npleases me least is _my_ part (underscores Bierce\'s). I am surprised\r\nthat you should yield to the schoolgirl desire for that shallowest of\r\nall literary devices, a "happy ending," by which all the pathos of the\r\nbook is effaced to "make a woman holiday." It is unworthy of you. So\r\nmuch vii did I feel this unworthiness that I hesitated a long time\r\nbefore even deciding to have so much of "odious ingenuity" and "mystery"\r\nas your making Benedicta the daughter of the Saltmaster and inventing\r\nher secret love for Ambrosius instead of Rochus.\r\n\r\n\'"Dramatic action," which is no less necessary in a story than in a\r\nplay, requires that so far as is possible what takes place shall be\r\n_seen_ to take place, not related as having previously taken place....\r\nCompare Shakespeare\'s _Cymbeline_ with his better plays. See how he\r\nspoiled it the same way. You need not feel ashamed to err as Shakespeare\r\nerred. Indeed, you did better than he, for his explanations were of\r\nthings already known to the reader, or spectator, of the play. _Your_\r\nexplanations are needful to an understanding of the things explained; it\r\nis _they_ that are needless. All "explanation" is unspeakably tedious,\r\nand is to be cut as short as possible. Far better to have nothing to\r\nexplain--to _show_ everything that occurs, in the very act of occurring.\r\nWe cannot always do that, but we should come as near to doing it as we\r\ncan. Anyhow, the "harking back" should not be done at the end of the\r\nbook, when the d\xe9nouement is already known and the reader\'s interest in\r\nthe action exhausted....\r\n\r\n\'Ambrosius and Benedicta are unique in letters. Their nobility, their\r\nsimplicity, their sufferings--everything that is theirs stamps them\r\nas "beings apart." They live in the memory sanctified and glorified by\r\nthese qualities and sorrows. They are, in the last and most gracious\r\nsense, children of nature. Leave them lying there in the lovely valley\r\nof the gallows, where Ambrosius shuddered as his foot fell on the spot\r\nwhere he was destined to sleep....\r\n\r\n\'Let _The Monk and the Hangman\'s Daughter_ alone. It is great work and\r\n_you_ should live to see the world confess it. Let me know if my faith\r\nin your faith in me is an error. You once believed in my judgment; I\r\nthink it is not yet impaired by age.\r\n\r\n\'Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n\'(Signed) Ambrose bierce.\'\r\n\r\nI can only add that my faith in Bierce\'s judgment of letters is as firm\r\nto-day as it was then, when I gave him power of attorney to place\r\nmy book with a publisher. This publisher embodied _The Monk and the\r\nHangman\'s Daughter_ in Bierce\'s collected works, then sold the right to\r\nMessrs. Albert and Charles Boni who without knowledge of the true facts\r\nbrought out an edition under Bierce\'s name.\r\n\r\nADOLPHE de CASTRO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MONK AND THE HANGMAN\'S DAUGHTER\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nOn the first day of May in the year of our Blessed Lord 1680, the\r\nFranciscan monks \xc6gidius, Romanus and Ambrosius were sent by their\r\nSuperior from the Christian city of Passau to the Monastery of\r\nBerchtesgaden, near Salzburg. I, Ambrosius, was the strongest and\r\nyoungest of the three, being but twenty-one years of age.\r\n\r\nThe Monastery of Berchtesgaden was, we knew, in a wild and mountainous\r\ncountry, covered with dismal forests, which were infested with bears\r\nand evil spirits; and our hearts were filled with sadness to think what\r\nmight become of us in so dreadful a place. But since it is Christian\r\nduty to obey the mandates of the Church, we did not complain, and were\r\neven glad to serve the wish of our beloved and revered Superior.\r\n\r\nHaving received the benediction, and prayed for the last time in the\r\nchurch of our Saint, we tied up our cowls, put new sandals on our feet,\r\nand set out, attended by the blessings of all. Although the way was\r\nlong and perilous, we did not lose our hope, for hope is not only the\r\nbeginning and the end of religion, but also the strength of youth and\r\nthe support of age. Therefore our hearts soon forgot the sadness of\r\nparting, and rejoiced in the new and varying scenes that gave us our\r\nfirst real knowledge of the beauty of the earth as God has made it. The\r\ncolour and brilliance of the air were like the garment of the Blessed\r\nVirgin; the sun shone like the Golden Heart of the Saviour, from which\r\nstreameth light and life for all mankind; the dark blue canopy that hung\r\nabove formed a grand and beautiful house of prayer, in which every blade\r\nof grass, every flower and living creature praised the glory of God.\r\n\r\nAs we passed through the many hamlets, villages and cities that lay\r\nalong our way, the thousands of people, busy in all the vocations of\r\nlife, presented to us poor monks a new and strange spectacle, which\r\nfilled us with wonder and admiration. When so many churches came into\r\nview as we journeyed on, and the piety and ardour of the people were\r\nmade manifest by the acclamations with which they hailed us and their\r\nalacrity in ministering to our needs, our hearts were full of gratitude\r\nand happiness. All the institutions of the Church were prosperous and\r\nwealthy, which showed that they had found favour in the sight of the\r\ngood God whom we serve. The gardens and orchards of the monasteries\r\nand convents were well kept, proving the care and industry of the pious\r\npeasantry and the holy inmates of the cloisters. It was glorious to hear\r\nthe peals of bells announcing the hours of the day: we actually breathed\r\nmusic in the air--the sweet tones were like the notes of angels singing\r\npraise to the Lord.\r\n\r\nWherever we went we greeted the people in the name of our patron Saint.\r\nOn all sides were manifest humility and joy: women and children hastened\r\nto the wayside, crowding about us to kiss our hands and beseech a\r\nblessing. It almost seemed as if we were no longer poor servitors of God\r\nand man, but lords and masters of this whole beautiful earth. Let us,\r\nhowever, not grow proud in spirit, but remain humble, looking carefully\r\ninto our hearts lest we deviate from the rules of our holy Order and sin\r\nagainst our blessed Saint.\r\n\r\nI, Brother Ambrosius, confess with penitence and shame that my soul\r\ncaught itself upon exceedingly worldly and sinful thoughts. It seemed to\r\nme that the women sought more eagerly to kiss my hands than those of my\r\ncompanions--which surely was not right, since I am not more holy than\r\nthey; besides, I am younger and less experienced and tried in the fear\r\nand commandments of the Lord. When I observed this error of the women,\r\nand saw how the maidens kept their eyes upon me, I became frightened,\r\nand wondered if I could resist should temptation accost me; and often I\r\nthought, with fear and trembling, that vows and prayer and penance alone\r\ndo not make one a saint; one must be so pure in heart that temptation is\r\nunknown. Ah me!\r\n\r\nAt night we always lodged in some monastery, invariably receiving a\r\npleasant welcome. Plenty of food and drink was set before us, and as we\r\nsat at table the monks would crowd about, asking for news of the great\r\nworld of which it was our blessed privilege to see and learn so much.\r\nWhen our destination was learned we were usually pitied for being\r\ndoomed to live in the mountain wilderness. We were told of ice-fields,\r\nsnow-crowned mountains and tremendous rocks, roaring torrents, caves and\r\ngloomy forests; also of a lake so mysterious and terrible that there was\r\nnone like it in the world. God be with us!\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day of our journey, while but a short distance beyond the\r\ncity of Salzburg, we saw a strange and ominous sight. On the horizon,\r\ndirectly in our front, lay a bank of mighty clouds, with many grey\r\npoints and patches of darker hue, and above, between them and the blue\r\nsky, a second firmament of perfect white. This spectacle greatly puzzled\r\nand alarmed us. The clouds had no movement; we watched them for hours\r\nand could see no change. Later in the afternoon, when the sun was\r\nsinking into the west, they became ablaze with light. They glowed and\r\ngleamed in a wonderful manner, and looked at times as if they were on\r\nfire!\r\n\r\nNo one can imagine our surprise when we discovered that what we had\r\nmistaken for clouds was simply earth and rocks. These, then, were the\r\nmountains of which we had heard so much, and the white firmament was\r\nnothing else than the snowy summit of the range--which the Lutherans say\r\ntheir faith can remove. I greatly doubt it.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nWhen we stood at the opening of the pass leading into the mountains we\r\nwere overcome with dejection; it looked like the mouth of Hell. Behind\r\nus lay the beautiful country through which we had come, and which now\r\nwe were compelled to leave forever; before us frowned the mountains with\r\ntheir inhospitable gorges and haunted forests, forbidding to the sight\r\nand full of peril to the body and the soul. Strengthening our hearts\r\nwith prayer and whispering anathemas against evil spirits, we entered\r\nthe narrow pass in the name of God, and pressed forward, prepared to\r\nsuffer whatever might befall.\r\n\r\nAs we proceeded cautiously on our way giant trees barred our progress\r\nand dense foliage almost shut out the light of day, the darkness being\r\ndeep and chill. The sound of our footfalls and of our voices, when we\r\ndared to speak, was returned to us from the great rocks bordering the\r\npass, with such distinctness and so many repetitions, yet withal so\r\nchanged, that we could hardly believe we were not accompanied by troops\r\nof invisible beings who mocked us and made sport of our fears. Great\r\nbirds of prey, startled from their nests in the treetops and the sides\r\nof the cliffs, perched upon high pinnacles of rock and eyed us malignly\r\nas we passed; vultures and ravens croaked above us in hoarse and savage\r\ntones that made our blood run cold. Nor could our prayers and hymns\r\ngive us peace; they only called forth other fowl and by their own echoes\r\nmultiplied the dreadful noises that beset us. It surprised us to observe\r\nthat huge trees had been plucked out of the earth by the roots and\r\nhurled down the sides of the hills, and we shuddered to think by what\r\npowerful hands this had been done. At times we passed along the edges of\r\nhigh precipices, and the dark chasms that yawned below were a terrible\r\nsight. A storm arose, and we were half-blinded by the fires of heaven\r\nand stunned by thunder a thousand times louder than we had ever heard.\r\nOur fears were at last worked up to so great a degree that we expected\r\nevery minute to see some devil from Hell leap from behind a rock in our\r\nfront, or a ferocious bear appear from the undergrowth to dispute our\r\nprogress. But only deer and foxes crossed our path, and our fears were\r\nsomewhat quieted to perceive that our blessed Saint was no less powerful\r\nin the mountains than on the plains below.\r\n\r\nAt length we reached the bank of a stream whose silvery waters presented\r\na most refreshing sight. In its crystal depths between the rocks we\r\ncould see beautiful golden trout as large as the carp in the pond of\r\nour monastery at Passau. Even in these wild places Heaven had provided\r\nbountifully for the fasting of the faithful.\r\n\r\nBeneath the black pines and close to the large lichen-covered rocks\r\nbloomed rare flowers of dark blue and golden yellow. Brother \xc6gidius,\r\nwho was as learned as pious, knew them from his herbarium and told us\r\ntheir names. We were delighted by the sight of various brilliant beetles\r\nand butterflies which had come out of their hiding-places after the\r\nrain. We gathered handfuls of flowers and chased the pretty winged\r\ninsects, forgetting our fears and prayers, the bears and evil spirits,\r\nin the exuberance of our joy.\r\n\r\nFor many hours we had not seen a dwelling nor a human being. Deeper and\r\ndeeper we penetrated the mountain region; greater and greater became the\r\ndifficulties we experienced in forest and ravine, and all the horrors of\r\nthe wilderness that we had already passed were repeated, but without so\r\ngreat an effect upon our souls, for we all perceived that the good God\r\nwas preserving us for longer service to His holy will. A branch of the\r\nfriendly river lay in our course, and, approaching it, we were delighted\r\nto find it spanned by a rough but substantial bridge. As we were about\r\nto cross I happened to cast my eyes to the other shore, where I saw a\r\nsight that made my blood turn cold with terror. On the opposite bank\r\nof the stream was a meadow, covered with beautiful flowers, and in the\r\ncentre a gallows upon which hung the body of a man! The face was turned\r\ntoward us, and I could plainly distinguish the features, which, though\r\nblack and distorted, showed unmistakable signs that death had come that\r\nvery day.\r\n\r\nI was upon the point of directing my companions\' attention to the\r\ndreadful spectacle, when a strange incident occurred: in the meadow\r\nappeared a young girl, with long golden hair, upon which rested a wreath\r\nof blossoms. She wore a bright red dress, which seemed to me to light up\r\nthe whole scene like a flame of fire. Nothing in her actions indicated\r\nfear of the corpse upon the gallows; on the contrary, she glided toward\r\nit barefooted through the grass, singing in a loud but sweet voice, and\r\nwaving her arms to scare away the birds of prey that had gathered\r\nabout it, uttering harsh cries and with a great buffeting of wings and\r\nsnapping of beaks. At the girl\'s approach they all took flight, except\r\none great vulture, which retained its perch upon the gallows and\r\nappeared to defy and threaten her. She ran close up to the obscene\r\ncreature, jumping, dancing, screaming, until it, too, put out its wide\r\nwings and flapped heavily away. Then she ceased her dancing, and, taking\r\na position at the gibbet\'s foot, calmly and thoughtfully looked up at\r\nthe swinging body of the unfortunate man.\r\n\r\nThe maiden\'s singing had attracted the attention of my companions, and\r\nwe all stood watching the lovely child and her strange surroundings with\r\ntoo much amazement to speak.\r\n\r\nWhile gazing on the surprising scene, I felt a cold shiver run through\r\nmy body. This is said to be a sure sign that someone has stepped upon\r\nthe spot which is to be your grave. Strange to say, I felt this chill at\r\nthe moment the maiden stepped under the gallows. But this only shows how\r\nthe true beliefs of men are mixed up with foolish superstitions; for how\r\ncould a sincere follower of Saint Franciscus possibly come to be buried\r\nbeneath a gallows?\r\n\r\n\'Let us hasten,\' I said to my companions, \'and pray for the soul of the\r\ndead.\'\r\n\r\nWe soon found our way to the spot, and, without raising our eyes, said\r\nprayers with great fervour; especially did I, for my heart was full of\r\ncompassion for the poor sinner who hung above. I recalled the words of\r\nGod, who said, \'Vengeance is mine,\' and remembered that the dear Saviour\r\nhad pardoned the thief upon the cross at His side; and who knows that\r\nthere were not mercy and forgiveness for this poor wretch who had died\r\nupon the gallows?\r\n\r\nOn our approach the maiden had retired a short distance, not knowing\r\nwhat to make of us and our prayers. Suddenly, however, in the midst of\r\nour devotions, I heard her sweet, bell-like tones exclaim: \'The vulture!\r\nthe vulture!\' and her voice was agitated, as if she felt great fear. I\r\nlooked up and saw a great grey bird above the pines, swooping downward.\r\nIt showed no fear of us, our sacred calling and our pious rites. My\r\nbrothers, however, were indignant at the interruption caused by the\r\nchild\'s voice, and scolded her. But I said: \'The girl is probably a\r\nrelation of the dead man. Now think of it, brothers; this terrible bird\r\ncomes to tear the flesh from his face and feed upon his hands and his\r\nbody. It is only natural that she should cry out.\'\r\n\r\nOne of the brothers said: \'Go to her, Ambrosius, and command her to be\r\nsilent that we may pray in peace for the departed soul of this sinful\r\nman.\'\r\n\r\nI walked among the fragrant flowers to where the girl stood with her\r\neyes still fixed upon the vulture, which swung in ever narrowing circles\r\nabout the gallows. Against a mass of silvery flowers on a bush by which\r\nshe stood the maid\'s exquisite figure showed to advantage, as I wickedly\r\npermitted myself to observe. Perfectly erect and motionless, she watched\r\nmy advance, though I marked a terrified look in her large, dark eyes, as\r\nif she feared that I would do her harm. Even when I was quite near her\r\nshe made no movement to come forward, as women and children usually did,\r\nand kiss my hands.\r\n\r\n\'Who are you?\' I said, \'and what are you doing in this dreadful place\r\nall alone?\'\r\n\r\nShe did not answer me, and made neither sign nor motion; so I repeated\r\nmy question:\r\n\r\n\'Tell me, child, what are you doing here?\'\r\n\r\n\'Scaring away the vultures,\' she replied, in a soft, musical voice,\r\ninexpressibly pleasing.\r\n\r\n\'Are you a relation of the dead man?\' I asked.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\'You knew him?\' I continued, \'and you pity his unchristian death?\'\r\n\r\nBut she was again silent, and I had to renew my questioning: \'What was\r\nhis name, and why was he put to death? What crime did he commit?\'\r\n\r\n\'His name was Nathaniel Alfinger, and he killed a man for a woman,\' said\r\nthe maiden, distinctly and in the most unconcerned manner that it is\r\npossible to conceive, as if murder and hanging were the commonest and\r\nmost uninteresting of all events. I was astounded, and gazed at her\r\nsharply, but her look was passive and calm, denoting nothing unusual.\r\n\'Did you know Nathaniel Alfinger?\'\r\n\r\n\'No.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yet you came here to protect his corpse from the fowls?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why do you do that service to one whom you did not know?\'\r\n\r\n\'I always do so.\'\r\n\r\n\'How--!\'\r\n\r\n\'Always when any one is hanged here I come and frighten away the birds\r\nand make them find other food. See--there is another vulture!\'\r\n\r\nShe uttered a wild, high scream, threw her arms above her head, and ran\r\nacross the meadow so that I thought her mad. The big bird flew away,\r\nand the maiden came quietly back to me, and, pressing her sunburnt hands\r\nupon her breast, sighed deeply, as from fatigue. With as much mildness\r\nas I could put into my voice, I asked her:\r\n\r\n\'What is your name?\'\r\n\r\n\'Benedicta.\'\r\n\r\n\'And who are your parents?\'\r\n\r\n\'My mother is dead.\'\r\n\r\n\'But your father--where is he?\'\r\n\r\nShe was silent. Then I pressed her to tell me where she lived, for\r\nI wanted to take the poor child home and admonish her father to have\r\nbetter care of his daughter and not let her stray into such dreadful\r\nplaces again.\r\n\r\n\'Where do you live, Benedicta? I pray you tell me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Here.\'\r\n\r\n\'What! here? Ah, my child, here is only the gallows.\'\r\n\r\nShe pointed toward the pines. Following the direction of her finger, I\r\nsaw among the trees a wretched hut which looked like a habitation more\r\nfit for animals than human beings. Then I knew better than she could\r\nhave told me whose child she was.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to my companions and they asked me who the girl was, I\r\nanswered: \'The hangman\'s daughter.\'\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nHaving commended the soul of the dead man to the intercession of the\r\nBlessed Virgin and the Holy Saints, we left the accursed spot, but as\r\nwe withdrew I looked back at the lovely child of the hangman. She stood\r\nwhere I had left her, looking after us. Her fair white brow was still\r\ncrowned with the wreath of primroses, which gave an added charm to her\r\nwonderful beauty of feature and expression, and her large, dark eyes\r\nshone like the stars of a winter midnight. My companions, to whom the\r\nhangman\'s daughter was a most unchristian object, reproved me for the\r\ninterest that I manifested in her; but it made me sad to think this\r\nsweet and beautiful child was shunned and despised through no fault of\r\nher own. Why should she be made to suffer blame because of her father\'s\r\ndreadful calling? And was it not the purest Christian charity which\r\nprompted this innocent maiden to keep the vultures from the body of a\r\nfellow-creature whom in life she had not even known and who had been\r\nadjudged unworthy to live? It seemed to me a more kindly act than that\r\nof any professed Christian who bestows money upon the poor. Expressing\r\nthese feelings to my companions, I found, to my sorrow, that they did\r\nnot share them; on the contrary, I was called a dreamer and a fool who\r\nwished to overthrow the ancient and wholesome customs of the world.\r\nEveryone, they said, was bound to execrate the class to which the\r\nhangman and his family belonged, for all who associated with such\r\npersons would surely be contaminated. I had, however, the temerity to\r\nremain steadfast in my conviction, and with due humility questioned the\r\njustice of treating such persons as criminals because they were a part\r\nof the law\'s machinery by which criminals were punished. Because in the\r\nchurch the hangman and his family had a dark corner specially set apart\r\nfor them, that could not absolve us from our duty as servants of the\r\nLord to preach the gospel of justice and mercy and give an example of\r\nChristian love and charity. But my brothers grew very angry with me, and\r\nthe wilderness rang with their loud vociferations, so that I began to\r\nfeel as if I were very wicked, although unable to perceive my error. I\r\ncould do nothing but hope that Heaven would be more merciful to us all\r\nthan we are to one another. In thinking of the maiden it gave me comfort\r\nto know that her name was Benedicta. Perhaps her parents had so named\r\nher as a means of blessing to one whom no one else would ever bless.\r\n\r\nBut I must relate what a wonderful country it was into which we were now\r\narrived. Were we not assured that all the world is the Lord\'s, for He\r\nmade it, we might be tempted to think such a wild region the kingdom of\r\nthe Evil One.\r\n\r\nFar down below our path the river roared and foamed between great\r\ncliffs, the grey points of which seemed to pierce the very sky. On our\r\nleft, as we gradually rose out of this chasm, was a black forest of\r\npines, frightful to see, and in front of us a most formidable peak.\r\nThis mountain, despite its terrors, had a comical appearance, for it was\r\nwhite and pointed like a fool\'s cap, and looked as if some one had put a\r\nflour-sack on the knave\'s head. After all, it was nothing but snow. Snow\r\nin the middle of the glorious month of May!--surely the works of God are\r\nwonderful and almost past belief! The thought came to me that if this\r\nold mountain should shake his head the whole region would be full of\r\nflying snow.\r\n\r\nWe were not a little surprised to find that in various places along our\r\nroad the forest had been cleared away for a space large enough to build\r\na hut and plant a garden. Some of these rude dwellings stood where\r\none would have thought that only eagles would have been bold enough to\r\nbuild; but there is no place, it seems, free from the intrusion of Man,\r\nwho stretches out his hand for everything, even that which is in the\r\nair. When at last we arrived at our destination and beheld the temple\r\nand the house erected in this wilderness to the name and glory of our\r\nbeloved Saint, our hearts were thrilled with pious emotions. Upon the\r\nsurface of a pine-covered rock was a cluster of huts and houses, the\r\nmonastery in the midst, like a shepherd surrounded by his flock. The\r\nchurch and monastery were of hewn stone, of noble architecture, spacious\r\nand comfortable.\r\n\r\nMay the good God bless our entrance into this holy place.\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nI have now been in this wilderness for a few weeks, but the Lord, too,\r\nis here, as everywhere. My health is good, and this house of our beloved\r\nSaint is a stronghold of the Faith, a house of peace, an asylum for\r\nthose who flee from the wrath of the Evil One, a rest for all who bear\r\nthe burden of sorrow. Of myself, however, I cannot say so much. I am\r\nyoung, and although my mind is at peace, I have so little experience of\r\nthe world and its ways that I feel myself peculiarly liable to error and\r\naccessible to sin. The course of my life is like a rivulet which draws\r\nits silver thread smoothly and silently through friendly fields and\r\nflowery meadows, yet knows that when the storms come and the rains fall\r\nit may become a raging torrent, defiled with earth and whirling away to\r\nthe sea the wreckage attesting the madness of its passion and its power.\r\n\r\nNot sorrow nor despair drew me away from the world into the sacred\r\nretreat of the Church, but a sincere desire to serve the Lord. My only\r\nwish is to belong to my beloved Saint, to obey the blessed mandates of\r\nthe Church, and, as a servant of God, to be charitable to all mankind,\r\nwhom I dearly love. The Church is, in truth, my beloved mother, for, my\r\nparents having died in my infancy I, too, might have perished without\r\ncare had she not taken pity on me, fed and clothed me and reared me as\r\nher own child. And, oh, what happiness there will be for me, poor monk,\r\nwhen I am ordained and receive holy orders as a priest of the Most High\r\nGod! Always I think and dream of it and try to prepare my soul for\r\nthat high and sacred gift. I know I can never be worthy of this great\r\nhappiness, but I do hope to be an honest and sincere priest, serving God\r\nand Man according to the light that is given from above. I often pray\r\nHeaven to put me to the test of temptation, that I may pass through\r\nthe fire unscathed and purified in mind and soul. As it is, I feel the\r\nsovereign peace which, in this solitude, lulls my spirit to sleep, and\r\nall life\'s temptations and trials seem far away, like perils of the sea\r\nto one who can but faintly hear the distant thunder of the waves upon\r\nthe beach.\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nOur Superior, Father Andreas, is a mild and pious gentleman. Our\r\nbrothers live in peace and harmony. They are not idle, neither are they\r\nworldly nor arrogant. They are temperate, not indulging too much in the\r\npleasures of the table--a praiseworthy moderation, for all this region,\r\nfar and wide--the hills and the valleys, the river and forest, with all\r\nthat they contain--belongs to the monastery. The woods are full of all\r\nkinds of game, of which the choicest is brought to our table, and we\r\nrelish it exceedingly. In our monastery a drink is prepared from malt\r\nand barley--a strong, bitter drink, refreshing after fatigue, but not,\r\nto my taste, very good.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable thing in this part of the country is the\r\nsalt-mining. I am told that the mountains are full of salt--how\r\nwonderful are the works of the Lord! In pursuit of this mineral Man\r\nhas penetrated deep into the bowels of the earth by means of shafts and\r\ntunnels, and brings forth the bitter marrow of the hills into the\r\nlight of the sun. The salt I have myself seen in red, brown and yellow\r\ncrystals. The works give employment to our peasants and their sons, with\r\na few foreign labourers, all under the command of an overseer, who is\r\nknown as the Saltmaster. He is a stern man, exercising great power, but\r\nour Superior and the brothers speak little good of him--not from any\r\nunchristian spirit, but because his actions are evil. The Saltmaster has\r\nan only son. His name is Rochus, a handsome but wild and wicked youth.\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nThe people hereabout are a proud, stubborn race. I am told that in an\r\nold chronicle they are described as descendants of the Romans, who\r\nin their day drove many tunnels into these mountains to get out the\r\nprecious salt; and some of these tunnels are still in existence. From\r\nthe window of my cell I can see these giant hills and the black forests\r\nwhich at sunset burn like great firebrands along the crests against the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nThe forefathers of these people (after the Romans) were, I am told, more\r\nstubborn still than they are, and continued in idolatry after all the\r\nneighbouring peoples had accepted the cross of the Lord our Saviour.\r\nNow, however, they bow their stiff necks to the sacred symbol and soften\r\ntheir hearts to receive the living truth. Powerful as they are in body,\r\nin spirit they are humble and obedient to the Word. Nowhere else did the\r\npeople kiss my hand so fervently as here, although I am not a priest--an\r\nevidence of the power and victory of our glorious faith.\r\n\r\nPhysically they are strong and exceedingly handsome in face and figure,\r\nespecially the young men; the elder men, too, walk as erect and proud as\r\nkings. The women have long golden hair, which they braid and twist about\r\ntheir heads very beautifully, and they love to adorn themselves with\r\njewels. Some have eyes whose dark brilliancy rivals the lustre of the\r\nrubies and garnets they wear about their white necks. I am told that\r\nthe young men fight for the young women as stags for does. Ah, what\r\nwicked passions exist in the hearts of men! But since I know nothing of\r\nthese things, nor shall ever feel such unholy emotions, I must not judge\r\nand condemn.\r\n\r\nLord, what a blessing is the peace with which Thou hast filled the\r\nspirits of those who are Thine own! Behold, there is no turmoil in my\r\nbreast; all is calm there as in the soul of a babe which calls \'Abba,\'\r\ndear Father. And so may it ever be.\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nI have again seen the hangman\'s beautiful daughter. As the bells were\r\nchiming for mass I saw her in front of the monastery church. I had just\r\ncome from the bedside of a sick man, and as my thoughts were gloomy the\r\nsight of her face was pleasant, and I should have liked to greet her,\r\nbut her eyes were cast down: she did not notice me. The square in front\r\nof the church was filled with people, the men and youths on one side, on\r\nthe other the women and maidens all clad in their high hats and adorned\r\nwith their gold chains. They stood close together, but when the poor\r\nchild approached all stepped aside, whispering and looking askance at\r\nher as if she were an accursed leper and they feared infection.\r\n\r\nCompassion filled my breast, compelling me to follow the maiden, and,\r\novertaking her, I said aloud:\r\n\r\n\'God greet you, Benedicta.\'\r\n\r\nShe shrank away as if frightened, then, looking up, recognised me,\r\nseemed astonished, blushed again and again and finally hung her head in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\'Do you fear to speak to me?\' I asked.\r\n\r\nBut she made no reply. Again I spoke to her: \'Do good, obey the Lord and\r\nfear no one: then shall you be saved.\'\r\n\r\nAt this she drew a long sigh, and replied in a low voice, hardly more\r\nthan a whisper: \'I thank you, my lord.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am not a lord, Benedicta,\' I said, \'but a poor servant of God, who\r\nis a gracious and kind Father to all His children, however lowly their\r\nestate. Pray to Him when your heart is heavy, and He will be near you.\'\r\n\r\nWhile I spoke she lifted her head and looked at me like a sad child that\r\nis being comforted by its mother. And, still speaking to her out of the\r\ngreat compassion in my heart, I led her into the church before all the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nBut do thou, O holy Franciscus, pardon the sin that I committed during\r\nthat high sacrament! For while Father Andreas was reciting the solemn\r\nwords of the mass my eyes constantly wandered to the spot where the poor\r\nchild knelt in a dark corner set apart for her and her father, forsaken\r\nand alone. She seemed to pray with holy zeal, and surely thou didst\r\ngrace her with a ray of thy favour, for it was through thy love of\r\nmankind that thou didst become a great saint, and didst bring before the\r\nThrone of Grace thy large heart, bleeding for the sins of all the world.\r\nThen shall not I, the humblest of thy followers, have enough of thy\r\nspirit to pity this poor outcast who suffers for no sin of her own? Nay,\r\nI feel for her a peculiar tenderness, which I cannot help accepting as a\r\nsign from Heaven that I am charged with a special mandate to watch over\r\nher, to protect her, and finally to save her soul.\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nOur Superior has sent for me and rebuked me. He told me I had caused\r\ngreat ill-feeling among the brothers and the people, and asked what\r\ndevil had me in possession that I should walk into church with the\r\ndaughter of the public hangman.\r\n\r\nWhat could I say but that I pitied the poor maiden and could not do\r\notherwise than as I did?\r\n\r\n\'Why did you pity her?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'Because all the people shun her,\' I replied, \'as if she were mortal\r\nsin itself, and because she is wholly blameless. It certainly is not her\r\nfault that her father is a hangman, nor his either, since, alas, hangmen\r\nmust be.\'\r\n\r\nAh, beloved Franciscus, how the Superior scolded thy poor servant for\r\nthese bold words.\r\n\r\n\'And do you repent?\' he demanded at the close of his reproof. But how\r\ncould I repent of my compassion--incited, as I verily believe, by our\r\nbeloved Saint?\r\n\r\nOn learning my obduracy, the Superior became very sad. He gave me a long\r\nlecture and put me under hard penance. I took my punishment meekly\r\nand in silence, and am now confined to my cell, fasting and chastising\r\nmyself. Nor in this do I spare myself at all, for it is happiness to\r\nsuffer for the sake of one so unjustly treated as the poor friendless\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nI stand at the grating of my cell, looking out at the high, mysterious\r\nmountains showing black against the evening sky. The weather being mild,\r\nI open the window behind the bars to admit the fresh air and better\r\nto hear the song of the stream below, which speaks to me with a divine\r\ncompanionship, gentle and consoling.\r\n\r\nI know not if I have already mentioned that the monastery is built upon\r\na rock high over the river. Directly under the windows of our cells are\r\nthe rugged edges of great cliffs, which none can scale but at the peril\r\nof his life. Imagine, then, my astonishment when I saw a living figure\r\nlift itself up from the awful abyss by the strength of its hands, and,\r\ndrawing itself across the edge, stand erect upon the very verge! In the\r\ndusk I could not make out what kind of creature it was; I thought\r\nit some evil spirit come to tempt me; so I crossed myself and said a\r\nprayer. Presently there is a movement of its arm, and something flies\r\nthrough the window, past my head, and lies upon the floor of my cell,\r\nshining like a white star. I bend and pick it up. It is a bunch of\r\nflowers such as I have never seen--leafless, white as snow, soft as\r\nvelvet, and without fragrance. As I stand by the window, the better to\r\nsee the wondrous flowers, my eyes turn again to the figure on the cliff,\r\nand I hear a sweet, low voice, which says: \'I am Benedicta, and I thank\r\nyou.\'\r\n\r\nAh, Heaven! it was the child, who, that she might greet me in my\r\nloneliness and penance, had climbed the dreadful rocks, heedless of the\r\ndanger. She knew, then, of my punishment--knew that it was for her.\r\n\r\nShe knew even the very cell in which I was confined. O holy Saint!\r\nsurely she could not have known all this but from thee; and I were worse\r\nthan an infidel to doubt that the feeling which I have for her signifies\r\nthat a command has been laid upon me to save her.\r\n\r\nI saw her bending over the frightful precipice. She turned a moment and\r\nwaved her hand to me and disappeared. I uttered an involuntary cry--had\r\nshe fallen? I grasped the iron bars of my window and shook them with all\r\nmy strength, but they did not yield. In my despair I threw myself upon\r\nthe floor, crying and praying to all the saints to protect the dear\r\nchild in her dangerous descent if still she lived, to intercede for her\r\nunshriven soul if she had fallen. I was still kneeling when Benedicta\r\ngave me a sign of her safe arrival below. It was such a shout as these\r\nmountaineers utter in their untamed enjoyment of life--only Benedicta\'s\r\nshout, coming from far below in the gorge, and mingled with its own\r\nstrange echoes, sounded like nothing I had ever heard from any human\r\nthroat, and so affected me that I wept, and the tears fell upon the wild\r\nflowers in my hand.\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nAs a follower of Saint Francisais, I am not permitted to own anything\r\ndear to my heart, so I have disposed of my most precious treasure; I\r\nhave presented to my beloved Saint the beautiful flowers which were\r\nBenedicta\'s offering. They are so placed before his picture in the\r\nmonastery church as to decorate the bleeding heart which he carries upon\r\nhis breast as a symbol of his suffering for mankind.\r\n\r\nI have learned the name of the flower: because of its colour, and\r\nbecause it is finer than other flowers, it is called Edelweiss--noble\r\nwhite. It grows in so rare perfection only upon the highest and wildest\r\nrocks--mostly upon cliffs, over abysses many hundred feet in depth,\r\nwhere one false step would be fatal to him who gathers it.\r\n\r\nThese beautiful flowers, then, are the real evil spirits of this wild\r\nregion; they lure many mortals to a dreadful death. The brothers here\r\nhave told me that never a year passes but some shepherd, some hunter or\r\nsome bold youth, attracted by these wonderful blossoms, is lost in the\r\nattempt to get them.\r\n\r\nMay God be merciful to all their souls!\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\nI must have turned pale when one of the brothers reported at the supper\r\ntable that upon the picture of Saint Franciscus had been found a bunch\r\nof edelweiss of such rare beauty as grows nowhere else in the country\r\nbut at the summit of a cliff which is more than a thousand feet high,\r\nand overhangs a dreadful lake. The brothers tell wondrous tales of the\r\nhorrors of this lake--how wild its waters and how deep, and how the most\r\nhideous spectres are seen along its shores or rising out of it.\r\n\r\nBenedicta\'s edelweiss, therefore, has caused great commotion and wonder,\r\nfor even among the boldest hunters there are few, indeed, who dare\r\nto climb that cliff by the haunted lake. And the tender child has\r\naccomplished the feat! She has gone quite alone to that horrible place,\r\nand has climbed the almost vertical wall of the mountain to the green\r\nspot where the flowers grow with which she was moved to greet me. I\r\ndoubt not that Heaven guarded her against mishap in order that I might\r\nhave a visible sign and token that I am charged with the duty of her\r\nsalvation.\r\n\r\nAh, thou poor sinless child, accurst in the eyes of the people, God hath\r\nsignified His care of thee, and in my heart I feel already something of\r\nthat adoration which shall be thy due when for thy purity and holiness\r\nHe shall bestow upon thy relics some signal mark of His favour, and the\r\nChurch shall declare thee blessed!\r\n\r\nI have learned another thing that I will chronicle here. In this country\r\nthese flowers are the sign of a faithful love: the youth presents them\r\nto his sweetheart, and the maidens decorate the hats of their lovers\r\nwith them. It is clear that, in expressing her gratitude to a humble\r\nservant of the Church, Benedicta was moved, perhaps without knowing it,\r\nto signify at the same time her love of the Church itself, although,\r\nalas, she has yet too little cause.\r\n\r\nAs I ramble about here, day after day, I am becoming familiar with\r\nevery path in the forest, in the dark pass, and on the slopes of the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nI am often sent to the homes of the peasants, the hunters and the\r\nshepherds, to carry either medicine to the sick or consolation to the\r\nsad. The most reverend Superior has told me that as soon as I receive\r\nholy orders I shall have to carry the sacraments to the dying, for I am\r\nthe youngest and the strongest of the brothers. In these high places it\r\nsometimes occurs that a hunter or a shepherd falls from the rocks,\r\nand after some days is found, still living. It is then the duty of the\r\npriest to perform the offices of our holy religion at the bedside of\r\nthe sufferer, so that the blessed Saviour may be there to receive the\r\ndeparting soul.\r\n\r\nThat I may be worthy of such grace, may our beloved Saint keep my heart\r\npure from every earthly passion and desire!\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\nThe monastery has celebrated a great festival, and I will report all\r\nthat occurred.\r\n\r\nFor many days before the event the brothers were busy preparing for\r\nit. Some decorated the church with sprays of pine and birch and with\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nThey went with the other men and gathered the most beautiful Alpine\r\nroses they could find, and as it is midsummer they grow in great\r\nabundance. On the day before the festival the brothers sat in the\r\ngarden, weaving garlands to adorn the church; even the most reverend\r\nSuperior and the Fathers took pleasure in our merry task. They walked\r\nbeneath the trees and chatted pleasantly while encouraging the brother\r\nbutler to spend freely the contents of the cellars.\r\n\r\nThe next morning was the holy procession. It was very beautiful to see,\r\nand added to the glory of our holy Church. The Superior walked under a\r\npurple silken canopy, surrounded by the worthy Fathers, and bore in his\r\nhands the sacred emblem of the crucifixion of our Saviour. We brothers\r\nfollowed, bearing burning candles and singing psalms. Behind us came a\r\ngreat crowd of the people, dressed in their finest attire.\r\n\r\nThe proudest of those in the procession were the mountaineers and the\r\nsalt-miners, the Saltmaster at their head on a beautiful horse adorned\r\nwith costly trappings. He was a proud-looking man, with his great sword\r\nat his side and a plumed hat upon his broad, high brow. Behind him rode\r\nRochus, his son. When we had collected in front of the gate to form\r\na line I took special notice of that young man. I judged him to be\r\nself-willed and bold. He wore his hat on the side of his head and cast\r\nflaming glances upon the women and the maidens. He looked contemptuously\r\nupon us monks. I fear he is not a good Christian, but he is the most\r\nbeautiful youth that I have ever seen: tall and slender like a young\r\npine, with light brown eyes and golden locks.\r\n\r\nThe Saltmaster is as powerful in this region as our Superior. He is\r\nappointed by the Duke and has judicial powers in all affairs. He has\r\neven the power of life and death over those accused of murder or any\r\nother abominable crime. But the Lord has fortunately endowed him with\r\ngood judgment and wisdom.\r\n\r\nThrough the village the procession moved out into the valley and down to\r\nthe entrances of the great salt mines. In front of the principal mine an\r\naltar was erected, and there our Superior read high mass, while all the\r\npeople knelt. I observed that the Salt-master and his son knelt and bent\r\ntheir heads with visible reluctance and this made me very sad. After\r\nthe service the procession moved toward the hill called \'Mount Calvary,\'\r\nwhich is still higher than the monastery, and from the top of which one\r\nhas a good view of the whole country below. There the reverend Superior\r\ndisplayed the crucifix in order to banish the evil powers which abound\r\nin these terrible mountains; and he also said prayers and pronounced\r\nanathemas against all demons infesting the valley below. The bells\r\nchimed their praises to the Lord, and it seemed as if divine voices were\r\nringing through the wilderness. It was all, indeed, most beautiful and\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nI looked about me to see if the child of the hangman were present, but I\r\ncould not see her anywhere, and knew not whether to rejoice that she was\r\nout of reach of the insults of the people or to mourn because deprived\r\nof the spiritual strength that might have come to me from looking upon\r\nher heavenly beauty.\r\n\r\nAfter the services came the feast. Upon a meadow sheltered by trees\r\ntables were spread, and the clergy and the people, the most reverend\r\nSuperior and the great Saltmaster partook of the viands served by the\r\nyoung men. It was interesting to see the young men make big fires of\r\npine and maple, put great pieces of beef upon wooden spits, turn them\r\nover the coals until they were brown, and then lay them before the\r\nFathers and the mountaineers. They also boiled mountain trout and carp\r\nin large kettles. The wheaten bread was brought in immense baskets, and\r\nas to drink, there was assuredly no scarcity of that, for the Superior\r\nand the Saltmaster had each given a mighty cask of beer. Both of these\r\nmonstrous barrels lay on wooden stands under an ancient oak. The boys\r\nand the Saltmaster\'s men drew from the cask which he had given, while\r\nthat of the Superior was served by the brother butler and a number of\r\nus younger monks. In honour of Saint Franciscus I must say that the\r\nclerical barrel was of vastly greater size than that of the Saltmaster.\r\n\r\nSeparate tables had been provided for the Superior and the Fathers,\r\nand for the Saltmaster and the best of his people. The Saltmaster and\r\nSuperior sat upon chairs which stood upon a beautiful carpet, and\r\ntheir seats were screened from the sun by a linen canopy. At the table,\r\nsurrounded by their beautiful wives and daughters, sat many knights, who\r\nhad come from their distant castles to share in the great festival. I\r\nhelped at table. I handed the dishes and filled the goblets and was able\r\nto see how good an appetite the company had, and how they loved that\r\nbrown and bitter drink. I could see also how amorously the Saltmaster\'s\r\nson looked at the ladies, which provoked me very much, as he could not\r\nmarry them all, especially those already married.\r\n\r\nWe had music, too. Some boys from the village, who practise on various\r\ninstruments in their spare moments, were the performers. Ah, how they\r\nyelled, those flutes and pipes, and how the fiddle bows danced and\r\nchirped! I do not doubt the music was very good, but Heaven has not seen\r\nfit to give me the right kind of ears.\r\n\r\nI am sure our blessed Saint must have derived great satisfaction from\r\nthe sight of so many people eating and drinking their bellies full.\r\nHeavens! how they did eat--what unearthly quantities they did away with!\r\nBut that was nothing to their drinking. I firmly believe that if every\r\nmountaineer had brought along a barrel of his own he would have emptied\r\nit, all by himself. But the women seemed to dislike the beer, especially\r\nthe young girls. Usually before drinking a young man would hand his cup\r\nto one of the maids, who barely touched it with her lips, and, making a\r\ngrimace, turned away her face. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the\r\nways of woman to say with certainty if this proved that at other times\r\nthey were so abstemious.\r\n\r\nAfter eating, the young men played at various games which exhibited\r\ntheir agility and strength. Holy Franciscus! what legs they have, what\r\narms and necks! They leapt, they wrestled with one another; it was like\r\nthe fighting of bears. The mere sight of it caused me to feel great\r\nfear. It seemed as if they would crush one another. But the maidens\r\nlooked on, feeling neither fear nor anxiety; they giggled and appeared\r\nwell pleased. It was wonderful, too, to hear the voices of these young\r\nmountaineers; they threw back their heads and shouted till the echoes\r\nrang from the mountain-sides and roared in the gorges as if from the\r\nthroats of a legion of demons.\r\n\r\nForemost among all was the Saltmaster\'s son. He sprang like a deer,\r\nfought like a fiend, and bellowed like a wild bull. Among these\r\nmountaineers he was a king. I observed that many were jealous of his\r\nstrength and beauty, and secretly hated him; yet all obeyed. It was\r\nbeautiful to see how this young man bent his slender body while leaping\r\nand playing the games--how he threw up his head like a stag at gaze,\r\nshook his golden locks and stood in the midst of his fellows with\r\nflaming cheeks and sparkling eyes. How sad to think that pride and\r\npassion should make their home in so lovely a body, which seems created\r\nfor the habitation of a soul that would glorify its Maker!\r\n\r\nIt was near dusk when the Superior, the Saltmaster, the Fathers and all\r\nthe distinguished guests parted and retired to their homes, leaving the\r\nothers at drink and dance. My duties compelled me to remain with the\r\nbrother butler to serve the debauching youths with beer from the great\r\ncask. Young Rochus remained too. I do not know how it occurred, but\r\nsuddenly he stood before me. His looks were dark and his manner proud.\r\n\r\n\'Are you,\' he said, \'the monk who gave offence to the people the other\r\nday?\'\r\n\r\nI asked humbly--though beneath my monk\'s robe I felt a sinful anger:\r\n\'What are you speaking of?\'\r\n\r\n\'As if you did not know!\' he said, haughtily. \'Now bear in mind what I\r\ntell you; if you ever show any friendship toward that girl I shall teach\r\nyou a lesson which you will not soon forget. You monks are likely to\r\ncall your impertinence by the name of some virtue; but I know the trick,\r\nand will have none of it. Make a note of that, you young cowl=wearer,\r\nfor your handsome face and big eyes will not save you.\'\r\n\r\nWith that he turned his back upon me and went away, but I heard his\r\nstrong voice ringing out upon the night as he sang and shouted with the\r\nothers. I was greatly alarmed to learn that this bold boy had cast his\r\neyes upon the hangman\'s lovely daughter. His feeling for her was surely\r\nnot honourable, or, instead of hating me for being kind to her, he would\r\nhave been grateful and would have thanked me. I feared for the child,\r\nand again and again did I promise my blessed Saint that I would watch\r\nover and protect her, in obedience to the miracle which he has wrought\r\nin my breast regarding her. With that wondrous feeling to urge me on,\r\nI cannot be slack in my duty, and, Benedicta, thou shalt be saved--thy\r\nbody and thy soul!\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\nLet me continue my report.\r\n\r\nThe boys threw dry brushwood into the fire so that the flames\r\nilluminated the whole meadow and shone red upon the trees. Then they\r\nlaid hands upon the village maidens and began to turn and swing them\r\nround and round. Holy saints! how they stamped and turned and threw\r\ntheir hats in the air, kicked up their heels, and lifted the girls from\r\nthe ground, as if the sturdy wenches were nothing but feather balls!\r\nThey shouted and yelled as if all the evil spirits had them in\r\npossession, so that I wished a herd of swine might come, that the devils\r\nmight leave these human brutes and go into the four-legged ones. The\r\nboys were quite full of the brown beer, which for its bitterness and\r\nstrength is a beastly drink.\r\n\r\nBefore long the madness of intoxication broke out; they attacked one\r\nanother with fists and knives, and it looked as if they would do murder.\r\nSuddenly the Saltmaster\'s son, who had stood looking on, leaped among\r\nthem, caught two of the combatants by the hair and knocked their heads\r\ntogether with such force that the blood started from their noses, and I\r\nthought surely their skulls had been crushed like egg-shells; but they\r\nmust have been very hard-headed, for on being released they seemed\r\nlittle the worse for their punishment. After much shouting and\r\nscreaming, Rochus succeeded in making peace, which seemed to me, poor\r\nworm, quite heroic. The music set in again: the fiddles scraped and\r\nthe pipes shrieked, while the boys with torn clothes and scratched and\r\nbleeding faces, renewed the dance as if nothing had occurred. Truly,\r\nthis is a people that would gladden the heart of a Bramarbas or a\r\nHolofernes!\r\n\r\nI had scarcely recovered from the fright which Rochus had given me, when\r\nI was made to feel a far greater one. Rochus was dancing with a tall and\r\nbeautiful girl, who looked the very queen of this young king. They made\r\nsuch mighty leaps and dizzy turns, but at the same time so graceful,\r\nthat all looked on with astonishment and pleasure. The girl had a\r\nsensuous smile on her lips and a bold look in her brown face, which\r\nseemed to say: \'See! I am the mistress of his heart!\' But suddenly he\r\npushed her from him as in disgust, broke from the circle of dancers, and\r\ncried to his friends: \'I am going to bring my own partner. Who will go\r\nwith me?\'\r\n\r\nThe tall girl, maddened by the insult, stood looking at him with the\r\nface of a demon, her black eyes burning like flames of hell! But her\r\ndiscomfiture amused the drunken youths, and they laughed aloud.\r\n\r\nSnatching a firebrand and swinging it about his head till the sparks\r\nflew in showers, Rochus cried again: \'Who goes with me?\' and walked\r\nrapidly away into the forest. The others seizing firebrands also, ran\r\nafter him, and soon their voices could be heard far away, ringing out\r\nupon the night, themselves no longer seen. I was still looking in the\r\ndirection which they had taken, when the tall girl whom Rochus had\r\ninsulted stepped to my side and hissed something into my ear. I felt her\r\nhot breath on my cheek.\r\n\r\n\'If you care for the hangman\'s daughter, then hasten and save her from\r\nthat drunken wretch. No woman resists him!\'\r\n\r\nGod! how the wild words of that woman horrified me! I did not doubt the\r\ngirl\'s words, but in my anxiety for the poor child I asked: \'How can I\r\nsave her?\'\r\n\r\n\'Run and warn her, monk,\' the wench replied: \'she will listen to you.\'\r\n\r\n\'But they will find her sooner than I.\'\r\n\r\n\'They are drunk and will not go fast. Besides, I know a path leading to\r\nthe hangman\'s hut by a shorter route.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then show me and be quick!\' I cried.\r\n\r\nShe glided away, motioning me to follow. We were soon in the woods,\r\nwhere it was so dark I could hardly see the woman\'s figure; but she\r\nmoved as fast and her step was as sure as in the light of day. Above us\r\nwe could see the torches of the boys, which showed that they had taken\r\nthe longer path along the mountain-side. I heard their wild shouts, and\r\ntrembled for the child. We had walked for some time in silence, having\r\nleft the youths far behind, when the young woman began speaking to\r\nherself. At first I did not understand, but soon my ears caught every\r\npassionate word:\r\n\r\n\'He shall not have her! To the devil with the hangman\'s whelp! Every one\r\ndespises her and spits at the sight of her. It is just like him--he\r\ndoes not care for what people think or say. Because they hate he loves.\r\nBesides, she has a pretty face. I\'ll make it pretty for her! I\'ll mark\r\nit with blood! But if she were the daughter of the devil himself he\r\nwould not rest until he had her. He shall not!\'\r\n\r\nShe lifted her arms and laughed wildly--I shuddered to hear her! I\r\nthought of the dark powers that live in the human breast, though I know\r\nas little of them, thank God, as a child.\r\n\r\nAt length we reached the Galgenberg, where stands the hangman\'s hut, and\r\na few moments\' climb brought us near the door.\r\n\r\n\'There she lives,\' said the girl, pointing to the hut, through the\r\nwindows of which shone the yellow light of a tallow candle; \'go warn\r\nher. The hangman is ill and unable to protect his daughter, even if he\r\ndared. You\'d better take her away--take her to the Alpfeld on the G\xf6ll,\r\nwhere my father has a house. They will not look for her up there.\'\r\n\r\nWith that she left me and vanished in the darkness.\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\nLooking in at the window of the hut, I saw the hangman sitting in a\r\nchair, with his daughter beside him, her hand upon his shoulder. I could\r\nhear him cough and groan, and knew that she was trying to soothe him\r\nin his pain. A world of love and sorrow was in her face, which was more\r\nbeautiful than ever.\r\n\r\nNor did I fail to observe how clean and tidy were the room and all in\r\nit. The humble dwelling looked, indeed, like a place blessed by the\r\npeace of God. Yet these blameless persons are treated as accurst and\r\nhated like mortal sin! What greatly pleased me was an image of the\r\nBlessed Virgin on the wall opposite the window at which I stood. The\r\nframe was decorated with flowers of the field, and the mantle of the\r\nHoly Mother festooned with edelweiss.\r\n\r\nI knocked at the door, calling out at the same time: \'Do not fear; it is\r\nI--Brother Ambrosius.\'\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that, on hearing my voice and name, Benedicta showed a\r\nsudden joy in her face, but perhaps it was only surprise--may the saints\r\npreserve me from the sin of pride. She came to the window and opened it.\r\n\r\n\'Benedicta,\' said I, hastily, after returning her greeting, \'wild and\r\ndrunken boys are on their way hither to take you to the dance. Rochus\r\nis with them, and says that he will fetch you to dance with him. I have\r\ncome before them to assist you to escape.\' At the name of Rochus I saw\r\nthe blood rise into her cheeks and suffuse her whole face with crimson.\r\nAlas, I perceived that my jealous guide was right: no woman could resist\r\nthat beautiful boy, not even this pious and virtuous child. When her\r\nfather comprehended what I said he rose to his feet and stretched out\r\nhis feeble arms as if to shield her from harm, but, although his soul\r\nwas strong, his body, I knew, was powerless. I said to him: \'Let me take\r\nher away; the boys are drunk and know not what they do. Your resistance\r\nwould only make them angry, and they might harm you both. Ah, look!\r\nSee their torches; hear their boisterous voices! Hasten, Benedicta--be\r\nquick, be quick!\'\r\n\r\nBenedicta sprang to the side of the now sobbing old man and tenderly\r\nembraced him. Then she hurried from the room, and after covering my\r\nhands with kisses ran away into the woods, disappearing in the night,\r\nat which I was greatly surprised. I waited for her to return, for a\r\nfew minutes, then entered the cabin to protect her father from the wild\r\nyouths who, I thought, would visit their disappointment upon him.\r\n\r\nBut they did not come. I waited and listened in vain. All at once I\r\nheard shouts of joy and screams that made me tremble and pray to the\r\nblessed Saint. But the sounds died away in the distance, and I knew that\r\nthe boys had retraced their steps down the Galgenberg to the meadow of\r\nthe fires. The sick man and I spoke of the miracle which had changed\r\ntheir hearts, and we were filled with gratitude and joy. Then I returned\r\nalong the path by which I had come. As I arrived near the meadow, I\r\ncould hear a wilder and madder uproar than ever, and could see through\r\nthe trees the glare of greater fires, with the figures of the youths\r\nand a few maids dancing in the open, their heads uncovered, their hair\r\nstreaming over their shoulders, their garments disordered by the fury\r\nof their movements. They circled about the fires, wound in and out among\r\nthem, showing black or red according to how the light struck them, and\r\nlooking altogether like Demons of the Pit commemorating some infernal\r\nanniversary or some new torment for the damned. And, holy Saviour!\r\nthere, in the midst of an illuminated space, upon which the others did\r\nnot trespass, dancing by themselves and apparently forgetful of all\r\nelse, were Rochus and Benedicta!\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\nHoly Mother of God! what can be worse than the fall of an angel? I\r\nsaw--I understood, then, that in leaving me and her father, Benedicta\r\nhad gone willingly to meet the very fate from which I had striven to\r\nsave her!\r\n\r\n\'The accurst wench has run into Rochus\' arms,\' hissed someone at my\r\nside, and, turning, I saw the tall brown girl who had been my guide,\r\nher face distorted with hate. \'I wish that I had killed her. Why did you\r\nsuffer her to play us this trick, you fool of a monk?\'\r\n\r\nI pushed her aside and ran toward the couple without thinking what I\r\ndid. But what could I do? Even at that instant, as though to prevent\r\nmy interference, though really unconscious of my presence, the drunken\r\nyouths formed a circle about them, bawling their admiration and clapping\r\ntheir hands to mark the time.\r\n\r\nAs these two beautiful figures danced they were a lovely picture. He,\r\ntall, slender and lithe, was like a god of the heathen Greeks, while\r\nBenedicta looked like a fairy. Seen through the slight mist upon the\r\nmeadows, her delicate figure, moving swiftly and swaying from side to\r\nside, seemed veiled with a web of purple and gold. Her eyes were cast\r\nmodestly upon the ground; her motions, though agile, were easy and\r\ngraceful; her face glowed with excitement, and it seemed as if her whole\r\nsoul were absorbed in the dance. Poor, sweet child! her error made me\r\nweep, but I forgave her. Her life was so barren and joyless; why should\r\nshe not love to dance? Heaven bless her! But Rochus--ah, God forgive\r\nhim!\r\n\r\nWhile I was looking on at all this, and thinking what it was my duty to\r\ndo, the jealous girl--she is called Amula--had stood near me, cursing\r\nand blaspheming. When the boys applauded Benedicta\'s dancing Amula made\r\nas if she would spring forward and strangle her. But I held the furious\r\ncreature back, and, stepping forward, called out: \'Benedicta!\'\r\n\r\nShe started at the sound of my voice, but though she hung her head a\r\nlittle lower, she continued dancing. Amula could control her rage no\r\nlonger, and rushed forward with a savage cry, trying to break into\r\nthe circle. But the drunken boys prevented. They jeered at her, which\r\nmaddened her the more, and she made effort after effort to reach her\r\nvictim. The boys drove her away with shouts, curses and laughter. Holy\r\nFranciscus, pray for us!--when I saw the hatred in Amula\'s eyes a cold\r\nshudder ran through my body. God be with us! I believe the creature\r\ncapable of killing the poor child with her own hands, and glorying in\r\nthe deed!\r\n\r\nI ought now to have gone home, but I remained, I thought of what might\r\noccur when the dance was over, for I had been told that the youths\r\ncommonly accompanied their partners home, and I was horrified to think\r\nof Rochus and Benedicta alone together in the forest and the night.\r\n\r\nImagine my surprise when all at once Benedicta lifted her head, stopped\r\ndancing, and, looking kindly at Rochus, said in her sweet voice, so like\r\nthe sound of silver bells: \'I thank you, sir, for having chosen me for\r\nyour partner in the dance in such a knightly way.\'\r\n\r\nThen, bowing to the Saltmaster\'s son, she slipped quickly through the\r\ncircle, and, before anyone could know what was occurring, disappeared\r\nin the black spaces of the forest. Rochus at first seemed stupefied with\r\namazement, but when he realized that Benedicta was gone he raved like a\r\nmadman. He shouted: \'Benedicta!\' He called her endearing names; but all\r\nto no purpose--she had vanished. Then he hurried after her and wanted\r\nto search the forest with torches, but the other youths dissuaded him.\r\nObserving my presence, he turned his wrath upon me; I think if he had\r\ndared he would have struck me. He cried: \'I\'ll make you smart for this,\r\nyou miserable cowl-wearer!\'\r\n\r\nBut I do not fear him. Praise be to God! Benedicta is not guilty, and\r\nI can respect her as before. Yet I tremble to think of the many perils\r\nwhich beset her. She is defenceless against the hate of Amula as well as\r\nagainst the lust of Rochus. Ah, if I could be ever at her side to\r\nwatch over and protect her! But I commend her to Thee, O Lord: the poor\r\nmotherless child shall surely not trust to Thee in vain.\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\nAlas! my unhappy fate!--again punished and again unable to find myself\r\nguilty.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Amula has talked about Benedicta and Rochus. The brown\r\nwench strolled from house to house telling how Rochus went to the\r\ngallows for his partner in the dance. And she added that Benedicta\r\nhad acted in the most shameless manner with the drunken boys. When the\r\npeople spoke to me of this I enlightened them regarding the facts, as it\r\nseemed to me my duty to do, and told all as it had occurred.\r\n\r\nBy this testimony, in contradiction of one who broke the Decalogue by\r\nbearing false witness against her neighbour I have, it seems, offended\r\nthe Superior. I was summoned before him and accused of defending the\r\nhangman\'s daughter against the statements of an honest Christian girl. I\r\nasked, meekly, what I should have done--whether I should have permitted\r\nthe innocent and defenceless to be calumniated.\r\n\r\n\'Of what interest,\' I was asked, \'can the hangman\'s daughter be to you?\r\nMoreover, it is a fact that she went of her own will to associate with\r\nthe drunken boys.\'\r\n\r\nTo this I replied: \'She went out of love to her father, for if the\r\nintoxicated youths had not found her they would have maltreated him--and\r\nshe loves the old man, who is ill and helpless. Thus it happened, and\r\nthus I have testified.\'\r\n\r\nBut His Reverence insisted that I was wrong, and put me under severe\r\npenance. I willingly undergo it: I am glad to suffer for the sweet\r\nchild. Nor will I murmur against the revered Superior, for he is my\r\nmaster, against whom to rebel, even in thought, is sin. Is not obedience\r\nthe foremost commandment of our great saint for all his disciples? Ah,\r\nhow I long for the priestly ordination and the holy oil! Then I\r\nshall have peace and be able to serve Heaven better and with greater\r\nacceptance.\r\n\r\nI am troubled about Benedicta. If not confined to my cell I should go\r\ntoward the Galgenberg: perhaps I should meet her. I grieve for her as if\r\nshe were my sister.\r\n\r\nBelonging to the Lord, I have no right to love anything but Him who died\r\nupon the cross for our sins--all other love is evil. O blessed Saints in\r\nHeaven! what if it be that this feeling which I have accepted as a sign\r\nand token that I am charged with the salvation of Benedicta\'s soul is\r\nbut an earthly love?\r\n\r\nPray for me, O dear Franciscus, that I may have the light, lest I stray\r\ninto the road which leads down to Hell. Light and strength, beloved\r\nSaint, that I may know the right path, and walk therein forever!\r\n\r\n16\r\n\r\nI stand at the window of my cell. The sun sinks and the shadows creep\r\nhigher on the sides of the mountains beyond the abyss. The abyss itself\r\nis filled with a mist whose billowy surface looks like a great lake. I\r\nthink how Benedicta climbed out of these awful depths to fling me the\r\nedelweiss; I listen for the sound of the stones displaced by her daring\r\nlittle feet and plunging into the chasm below. But night after night has\r\npassed. I hear the wind among the pines; I hear the water roaring in the\r\ndeeps; I hear the distant song of the nightingale; but her voice I do\r\nnot hear.\r\n\r\nEvery evening the mist rises from the abyss. It forms billows; then\r\nrings; then flakes, and these rise and grow and darken until they are\r\ngreat clouds. They cover the hill and the valley, the tall pines and the\r\nsnow-pointed mountains. They extinguish the last remaining touches of\r\nsunlight on the higher peaks, and it is night. Alas, in my soul also\r\nthere is night--dark, starless and without hope of dawn!\r\n\r\nTo-day is Sunday. Benedicta was not in church--\'the dark corner\'\r\nremained vacant. I was unable to keep my mind upon the service, a sin\r\nfor which I shall do voluntary penance.\r\n\r\nAmula was among the other maidens, but I saw nothing of Rochus. It\r\nseemed to me that her watchful black eyes were a sufficient guard\r\nagainst any rival, and that in her jealousy Benedicta would find\r\nprotection. God can make the basest passions serve the most worthy ends,\r\nand the reflection gave me pleasure, which, alas, was of short life.\r\n\r\nThe services being at an end, the Fathers and friars left the church\r\nslowly in procession, moving through the vestry, while the people went\r\nout at the main entrance. From the long covered gallery leading out of\r\nthe vestry one has a full view of the public square of the village. As\r\nwe friars, who were behind the Fathers, were in the gallery, something\r\noccurred which I shall remember even to the day of my death as an unjust\r\ndeed which Heaven permitted for I know not what purpose. It seems that\r\nthe Fathers must have known what was coming, for they halted in the\r\ngallery, giving us all an opportunity to look out upon the square.\r\n\r\nI heard a confused noise of voices. It came nearer, and the shouting and\r\nyelling sounded like the approach of all the fiends of Hell. Being at\r\nthe farther end of the gallery I was unable to see what was going on\r\nin the square, so I asked a brother at a window near by what it was all\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\'They are taking a woman to the pillory,\' he answered.\r\n\r\n\'Who is it?\'\r\n\r\n\'A girl.\'\r\n\r\n\'What has she done?\'\r\n\r\n\'You ask a foolish question. Whom are pillories and whipping-posts for\r\nbut fallen women?\'\r\n\r\nThe howling mob passed farther into the square, so that I had a full\r\nview. In the front were boys, leaping, gesticulating and singing vile\r\nsongs. They seemed mad with joy and made savage by the shame and pain of\r\ntheir fellow-creature. Nor did the maids behave much better. \'Fie upon\r\nthe outcast!\' they cried. \'See what it is to be a sinner! Thank heaven,\r\nwe are virtuous.\'\r\n\r\nIn the rear of these yelling boys, surrounded by this mob of screaming\r\nwomen and girls--O God! how can I write it? How can I express the\r\nhorror of it? In the midst of it all--she, the lovely, the sweet, the\r\nimmaculate Benedicta!\r\n\r\nO my Saviour! how did I see all this, yet am still living to relate\r\nit? I must have come near to death. The gallery, the square, the people\r\nseemed whirling round and round; the earth sank beneath my feet, and,\r\nalthough I strained my eyes open to see, yet all was dark. But it must\r\nhave been for but a short time; I recovered, and, on looking down into\r\nthe square, saw her again.\r\n\r\nThey had clothed her in a long gray cloak, fastened at the waist with a\r\nrope. Her head bore a wreath of straw, and on her breast, suspended by\r\na string about the neck, was a black tablet bearing in chalk the word\r\n\'Buhle\'--harlot.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the rope about her waist a man led her. I looked at him\r\nclosely, and--O most holy Son of God, what brutes and beasts Thou didst\r\ncome to save!--it was Benedicta\'s father! They had compelled the poor\r\nold man to perform one of the duties of his office by leading his own\r\nchild to the pillory! I learned later that he had implored the Superior\r\non his knees not to lay this dreadful command upon him, but all in vain.\r\n\r\nThe memory of this scene can never leave me. The hangman did not remove\r\nhis eyes from his daughter\'s face, and she frequently nodded at him and\r\nsmiled. By the grace of God, the maiden smiled!\r\n\r\nThe mob insulted her, called her vile names and spat upon the ground in\r\nfront of her feet. Nor was this all. Observing that she took no notice\r\nof them, they pelted her with dust and grass. This was more than the\r\npoor father could endure, and, with a faint, inarticulate moan, he fell\r\nto the ground in a swoon.\r\n\r\nOh, the pitiless wretches!--they wanted to lift him up and make him\r\nfinish his task, but Benedicta stretched out her arm in supplication,\r\nand with an expression of so ineffable tenderness upon her beautiful\r\nface that even the brutal mob felt her gentle power and recoiled before\r\nher, leaving the unconscious man upon the ground. She knelt and took\r\nher father\'s head in her lap. She whispered in his ear words of love and\r\ncomfort. She stroked his gray hair and kissed his pale lips until she\r\nhad coaxed him into consciousness and he had opened his eyes. Benedicta,\r\nthrice blessed Benedicta, thou surely art born to be a saint, for thou\r\ndidst show a divine patience like that with which our Saviour bore His\r\ncross and with it all the sins of the world!\r\n\r\nShe helped her father to rise, and smiled brightly in his face when he\r\nmade out to stand. She shook the dust from his clothing, and then, still\r\nsmiling and murmuring words of encouragement, handed him the rope. The\r\nboys yelled and sang, the women screamed, and the wretched old man led\r\nhis innocent child to the place of shame.\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\nWhen I was back again in my cell I threw myself upon the stones\r\nand cried aloud to God against the injustice and misery that I had\r\nwitnessed, and against the still greater misery of which I had been\r\nspared the sight. I saw in my mind the father binding his child to the\r\npost. I saw the brutal populace dance about her with savage delight.\r\nI saw the vicious Amula spit in the pure one\'s face. I prayed long and\r\nearnestly that the poor child might be made strong to endure her great\r\naffliction.\r\n\r\nThen I sat and waited. I waited for the setting of the sun, for at\r\nthat time the sufferer is commonly released from the whipping-post. The\r\nminutes seemed hours, the hours eternities. The sun did not move; the\r\nday of shame was denied a night.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that I tried to understand it all; I was stunned and\r\ndazed. Why did Rochus permit Benedicta to be so disgraced? Does he think\r\nthe deeper her shame the more easily he can win her? I know not, nor do\r\nI greatly care to search out his motive. But, God help me! I myself feel\r\nher disgrace, most keenly.\r\n\r\nAnd, Lord, Lord, what a light has come into the understanding of Thy\r\nservant! It has come to me like a revelation out of Heaven that my\r\nfeeling for Benedicta is more and less than what I thought it. It is\r\nan earthly love--the love of a man for a woman. As first this knowledge\r\nbroke into my consciousness my breath beat quick and hard; it seemed to\r\nme that I should suffocate. Yet such was the hardness of my heart from\r\nwitnessing so terrible an injustice tolerated by Heaven, that I was\r\nunable wholly to repent. In the sudden illumination I was blinded: I\r\ncould not clearly see my degree of sin. The tumult of my emotions was\r\nnot altogether disagreeable; I had to confess to myself that I would not\r\nwillingly forego it even if I knew it wicked. May the Mother of Mercy\r\nintercede for me!\r\n\r\nEven now I cannot think that in supposing myself to have a divine\r\nmandate to save the soul of Benedicta, and prepare her for a life of\r\nsanctity, I was wholly in error. This other human desire--comes it not\r\nalso of God? Is it not concerned for the good of its object? And what\r\ncan be a greater good than salvation of the soul?--a holy life on earth,\r\nand in Heaven eternal happiness and glory to reward it. Surely the\r\nspiritual and the carnal love are not so widely different as I have been\r\ntaught to think them. They are, perhaps, not antagonistic, and are but\r\nexpressions of the same will. O holy Franciscus, in this great light\r\nthat has fallen about me, guide thou my steps. Show to my dazzled eyes\r\nthe straight, right way to Benedicta\'s good!\r\n\r\nAt length the sun disappeared behind the cloister. The flakes and\r\ncloudlets gathered upon the horizon; the haze rose from the abyss and,\r\nbeyond, the purple shadow climbed higher and higher, the great slope of\r\nthe mountain, extinguishing at last the gleam of light upon the summit.\r\nThank God, oh, thank God, she is free!\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\nI have been very ill, but by the kind attention of the brothers am\r\nsufficiently recovered to leave my bed. It must be God\'s will that I\r\nlive to serve Him, for certainly I have done nothing to merit His great\r\nmercy in restoring me to health. Still, I feel a yearning in my soul for\r\na complete dedication of my poor life to Him and His service. To embrace\r\nHim and be bound up in His love are now the only aspirations that I\r\nhave. As soon as the holy oil is on my brow, these hopes, I am sure,\r\nwill be fulfilled, and, purged of my hopeless earthly passion for\r\nBenedicta, I shall be lifted into a new and diviner life. And it may be\r\nthat then I can, without offence to Heaven or peril to my soul, watch\r\nover and protect her far better than I can now as a wretched monk.\r\n\r\nI have been weak. My feet, like those of an infant, failed to support\r\nmy body. The brothers carried me into the garden. With what gratitude\r\nI again looked upward into the blue of the sky! How rapturously I gazed\r\nupon the white peaks of the mountains and the black forests on their\r\nslopes! Every blade of grass seemed to me of special interest, and I\r\ngreeted each passing insect as if it were an old acquaintance.\r\n\r\nMy eyes wander to the south, where the Galgenberg is, and I think\r\nunceasingly of the poor child of the hangman. What has become of her?\r\nHas she survived her terrible experience in the public square? What is\r\nshe doing? Oh, that I were strong enough to walk to the Galgenberg! But\r\nI am not permitted to leave the monastery, and there is none of whom I\r\ndare ask her fate. The friars look at me strangely; it is as if they\r\nno longer regarded me as one of them. Why is this so? I love them, and\r\ndesire to live in harmony with them. They are kind and gentle, yet they\r\nseem to avoid me as much as they can. What does it all mean?\r\n\r\n19\r\n\r\nI have been in the presence of the most reverend Superior, Father\r\nAndreas. \'Your recovery was miraculous,\' said he. \'I wish you to be\r\nworthy of such mercies, and to prepare your soul for the great blessing\r\nthat awaits you. I have, therefore, my son, ordained that you leave us\r\nfor a season, to dwell apart in the solitude of the mountains, for the\r\ndouble purpose of restoring your strength and affording you an\r\ninsight into your own heart. Make a severe examination apart from any\r\ndistractions, and you will perceive, I do not doubt, the gravity of your\r\nerror. Pray that a divine light may be shed upon your path, that you may\r\nwalk upright in the service of the Lord as a true priest and apostle,\r\nwith immunity from all base passions and earthly desires.\'\r\n\r\nI had not the presumption to reply. I submit to the will of His\r\nReverence without a murmur, for obedience is a rule of our Order. Nor\r\ndo I fear the wilderness, although I have heard that it is infested with\r\nwild beasts and evil spirits. Our superior is right: the time passed in\r\nsolitude will be to me a season of probation, purification and healing,\r\nof which I am doubtless in sore need. So far I have progressed in sin\r\nonly; for in confession I have kept back many things. Not from the fear\r\nof punishment, but because I could not mention the name of the maiden\r\nbefore any other than my holy and blessed Francisais, who alone can\r\nunderstand. He looks kindly down upon me from the skies, listening to\r\nmy sorrow; and whatever of guilt there may be in my compassion for the\r\ninnocent and persecuted child he willingly overlooks for the sake of our\r\nblessed Redeemer, who also suffered injustice and was acquainted with\r\ngrief.\r\n\r\nIn the mountains it will be my duty to dig certain roots and send them\r\nto the monastery. From such roots as I am instructed to gather the\r\nFathers distil a liquor which has become famous throughout the land,\r\neven as far, I have been told, as the great city of Munich. This liquor\r\nis so strong and so fiery with spices that after drinking it one feels\r\na burning in his throat as if he had swallowed a flame from Hell; yet it\r\nis held in high esteem everywhere by reason of its medicinal properties,\r\nit being a remedy for many kinds of ills and infirmities; and it is said\r\nto be good also for the health of the soul, though I should suppose\r\na godly life might be equally efficacious in places where the liquor\r\ncannot be obtained. However this may be, from the sale of the liquor\r\ncomes the chief revenue of the monastery.\r\n\r\nThe root from which it is chiefly made is that of an Alpine plant\r\ncalled _gentiana_, which grows in great abundance on the sides of the\r\nmountains. In the months of July and August the friars dig the roots and\r\ndry them by fire in the mountain cabins, and they are then packed and\r\nsent to the monastery. The Fathers have the sole right to dig the root\r\nin this region, and the secret of manufacturing the liquor is jealously\r\nguarded.\r\n\r\nAs I am to live in the high country for some time, the Superior\r\nhas directed me to collect the root from time to time as I have the\r\nstrength. A boy, a servant in the monastery, is to guide me to my\r\nsolitary station, carrying up my provisions and returning immediately.\r\nHe will come once a week to renew my supply of food and take away the\r\nroots that I shall have dug.\r\n\r\nNo time has been lost in dispatching me on my penitential errand. This\r\nvery evening I have taken leave of the Superior, and, retiring to\r\nmy cell, have packed my holy books, the _Agnus_ and the _Life of St.\r\nFranciscus_, in a bag. Nor have I forgotten my writing-materials with\r\nwhich to continue my diary. These preparations made, I have fortified my\r\nsoul with prayer, and am ready for any fate, even an encounter with the\r\nbeasts and demons.\r\n\r\nBeloved Saint, forgive the pain I feel in going away without having seen\r\nBenedicta, or even knowing what has become of her since that dreadful\r\nday. Thou knowest, O glorious one, and humbly do I confess, that I long\r\nto hasten to the Galgenberg, if only to get one glimpse of the hut\r\nwhich holds the fairest and best of her sex. Take me not, holy one, too\r\nseverely to task, I beseech thee, for the weakness of my erring human\r\nheart!\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\nAs I left the monastery with my young guide all was quiet within its\r\nwalls; the holy Brotherhood slept the sleep of peace, which had so long\r\nbeen denied to me. It was early dawn, and the clouds in the east were\r\nbeginning to show narrow edges of gold and crimson as we ascended the\r\npath leading to the mountain. My guide, with bag upon his shoulder, led,\r\nand I followed, with my robe fastened back and a stout stick in my hand.\r\nThis had a sharp iron point which might be used against wild beasts.\r\n\r\nMy guide was a light-haired, blue-eyed young fellow with a cheerful and\r\namiable face. He evidently found a keen delight in climbing his native\r\nhills toward the high country whither we were bound. He seemed not to\r\nfeel the weight of the burden that he bore; his gait was light and\r\nfree, his footing sure. He sprang up the steep and rugged way like a\r\nmountain-goat.\r\n\r\nThe boy was in high spirits. He told me strange tales of ghosts and\r\ngoblins, witches and fairies. These last he seemed to be very well\r\nacquainted with. He said they appeared in shining garments, with bright\r\nhair and beautiful wings, and this description agrees very nearly with\r\nwhat is related of them in books by certain of the Fathers. Anyone to\r\nwhom they take a fancy, says the boy, they are able to keep under their\r\nspell, and no one can break the enchantment, not even the Holy Virgin.\r\nBut I judge that this is true of only such as are in sin, and that the\r\npure in heart have nothing to fear from them.\r\n\r\nWe travelled up hill and down, through forests and blooming meadows and\r\nacross ravines. The mountain-streams, hastening down to the valleys,\r\nfull-banked and noisy, seemed to be relating the wonderful things that\r\nthey had seen and the strange adventures they had met with on their way.\r\nSometimes the hillsides and the woods resounded with nature\'s various\r\nvoices, calling, whispering, sighing, chanting praises to the Lord of\r\nall. Now and again we passed a mountaineer\'s cabin, before which played\r\nchildren, yellow-haired and unkempt. On seeing strangers, they ran away.\r\nBut the women came forward, with infants in their arms, and asked for\r\nbenedictions. They offered us milk, butter, green cheese, and black\r\nbread. We frequently found the men seated in front of their huts,\r\ncarving wood, mostly images of the Saviour upon the cross. These are\r\nsent to the city of Munich, where they are offered for sale, bringing, I\r\nam told, considerable money and much honour to their pious makers.\r\n\r\nAt last we arrived at the shore of a lake, but a dense fog prevented a\r\nclear view of it. A clumsy little boat was found moored to the bank; my\r\nguide bade me enter it, and presently it seemed as if we were gliding\r\nthrough the sky in the midst of the clouds. I had never before been\r\non the water, and felt a terrible misgiving lest we should capsize and\r\ndrown. We heard nothing but the sound of the ripples against the sides\r\nof the boat. Here and there, as we advanced, some dark object became\r\ndimly visible for a moment, then vanished as suddenly as it had\r\nappeared, and we seemed gliding again through empty space. As the mist\r\nat times lifted a little, I observed great black rocks protruding from\r\nthe water, and not far from shore were lying giant trees half submerged,\r\nwith huge limbs that looked like the bones of some monstrous skeleton.\r\nThe scene was so full of horrors that even the joyous youth was silent\r\nnow, his watchful eye ever seeking to penetrate the fog in search of new\r\ndangers.\r\n\r\nBy all these signs I knew that we were crossing that fearful lake which\r\nis haunted by ghosts and demons, and I therefore commended my soul to\r\nGod. The power of the Lord overcomes all evil. Scarcely had I said my\r\nprayer against the spirits of darkness, when suddenly the veil of fog\r\nwas rent asunder, and like a great rose of fire the sun shone out,\r\nclothing the world in garments of colour and gold!\r\n\r\nBefore this glorious eye of God the darkness fled and was no more. The\r\ndense fog, which had changed to a thin, transparent mist, lingered a\r\nlittle on the mountain-sides, then vanished quite away. Except in the\r\nblack clefts of the hills, no vestige of it stayed. The lake was as\r\nliquid silver; the mountains were gold, bearing forests that were like\r\nflames of fire. My heart was filled with wonder and gratitude.\r\n\r\nAs our boat crept on I observed that the lake filled a long, narrow\r\nbasin. On our right the cliffs rose to a great height, their tops\r\ncovered with pines, but to the left and in front lay a pleasant land,\r\nwhere stood a large building. This was Saint Bartholom\xe6, the summer\r\nresidence of his Reverence, Superior Andreas.\r\n\r\nThis garden spot was of no great extent: it was shut in on all sides but\r\nthat upon which the lake lay by cliffs that rose a thousand feet into\r\nthe air. High in the front of this awful wall was set a green meadow,\r\nwhich seemed like a great jewel gleaming upon the gray cloak of the\r\nmountain. My guide pointed it out as the only place in all that region\r\nwhere the edelweiss grew. This, then, was the very place where Benedicta\r\nhad culled the lovely flowers that she had brought to me during my\r\npenance. I gazed upward to that beautiful but terrible spot with\r\nfeelings that I have no words to express. The youth, his mood\r\nsympathetic with the now joyous aspect of nature, shouted and sang, but\r\nI felt the hot tears rise into my eyes and flow down upon my cheeks, and\r\nconcealed my face in my cowl.\r\n\r\n21\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the boat we climbed the mountain. Dear Lord, nothing comes\r\nfrom Thy hand without a purpose and a use, but why Thou shouldst have\r\npiled up these mountains, and why Thou shouldst have covered them\r\nwith so many stones, is a mystery to me, since I can see no purpose in\r\nstones, which are a blessing to neither man nor beast.\r\n\r\nAfter hours of climbing we reached a spring, where I sat down, faint\r\nand footsore and out of breath. As I looked about me the scene fully\r\njustified all that I had been told of these high solitudes. Wherever I\r\nturned my eyes was nothing but gray, bare rocks streaked with red and\r\nyellow and brown. There were dreary wastes of stones where nothing\r\ngrew--no single plant nor blade of grass--dreadful abysses filled with\r\nice, and glittering snowfields sloping upward till they seemed to touch\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\nAmong the rocks I did, however, find a few flowers. It seemed as if\r\nthe Creator of this wild and desolate region had Himself found it too\r\nhorrible, and, reaching down to the valleys, had gathered a handful\r\nof flowers and scattered them in the barren places. These flowers, so\r\ndistinguished by the Divine hand, have bloomed with a celestial beauty\r\nthat none others know. The boy pointed out the plant whose root I am to\r\ndig, as well as several strong and wholesome herbs serviceable to man,\r\namong them the golden-flowered arnica.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour we continued our journey, which we pursued until I was\r\nhardly able to drag my feet along the path. At last we reached a lonely\r\nspot surrounded by great black rocks. In the centre was a miserable hut\r\nof stones, with a low opening in one side for an entrance, and this, the\r\nyouth told me, was to be my habitation. We entered, and my heart sank to\r\nthink of dwelling in such a place. There was no furniture of any kind. A\r\nwide bench, on which was some dry Alpine grass, was to be my bed.\r\nThere was a fireplace, with some wood for fuel, and a few simple\r\ncooking-utensils.\r\n\r\nThe boy took up a pan and ran away with it, and, throwing myself down in\r\nfront of the hut, I was soon lost in contemplation of the wildness and\r\nterror of the place in which I was to prepare my soul for service of\r\nthe Lord. The boy soon returned, bearing the pan in both hands, and on\r\nseeing me he gave a joyful shout, whose echoes sounded like a hundred\r\nvoices babbling among the rocks on every side. After even so short a\r\nperiod of solitude I was so happy to see a human face that I came near\r\nanswering his greeting with unbecoming joy. How, then, could I hope to\r\nsustain a week of isolation in that lonely spot?\r\n\r\nWhen the boy placed the pan before me it was full of milk, and he\r\nbrought forth from his clothing a pat of yellow butter, prettily adorned\r\nwith Alpine flowers, and a cake of snow-white cheese wrapped in aromatic\r\nherbs. The sight delighted me, and I asked him, jokingly: \'Do butter\r\nand cheese, then, grow on stones up here, and have you found a spring of\r\nmilk?\'\r\n\r\n\'You might accomplish such a miracle,\' he replied, \'but I prefer to\r\nhasten to the Black Lake and ask this food of the young women who live\r\nthere.\' He then got some flour from a kind of pantry in the hut, and,\r\nhaving kindled a fire on the hearth, proceeded to make a cake.\r\n\r\n\'Then we are not alone in this wilderness,\' I said. \'Tell me where is\r\nthat lake on the shore of which these generous people dwell?\'\r\n\r\n\'The Black Lake,\' he replied, blinking his eyes, which were full of\r\nsmoke, \'is behind that _Kogel_ yonder, and the dairy-house stands on the\r\nedge of the cliff above the water. It is a bad place. The lake reaches\r\nclear down to Hell, and you can hear, through the fissures of the rocks,\r\nthe roaring and hissing of the flames and the groans of the souls. And\r\nin no other place in all this world are there so many fierce and\r\nevil spirits. Beware of it! You might fall ill there in spite of your\r\nsanctity. Milk and butter and cheese can be obtained at the Green Lake\r\nlower down; but I will tell the women to send up what you require. They\r\nwill be glad to oblige you; and if you will preach them a sermon every\r\nSunday, they will fight the very devil for you!\'\r\n\r\nAfter our meal, which I thought the sweetest I had ever eaten, the boy\r\nstretched himself in the sunshine and straightway fell asleep, snoring\r\nso loudly that, tired as I was, I could hardly follow his example.\r\n\r\n22\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke the sun was already behind the mountains, whose tops were\r\nfringed with fire. I felt as one in a dream, but was soon recalled to my\r\nsenses, and made to feel that I was alone in the wilderness by shouts\r\nof the young man in the distance. Doubtless he had pitied my condition,\r\nfor, instead of disturbing me, he had gone away without taking leave,\r\nbeing compelled to reach the dairy on the Green Lake before nightfall.\r\nEntering the cabin, I found a fire burning lustily and a quantity of\r\nfuel piled beside it. Nor had the thoughtful youth forgotten to prepare\r\nmy supper of bread and milk. He had also shaken up the grass on my hard\r\nbed, and covered it with a woollen cloth, for which I was truly grateful\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nRefreshed by my long sleep, I remained outside the cabin till late in\r\nthe evening. I said my prayers in view of the gray rocks beneath the\r\nblack sky, in which the stars blinked merrily. They seemed much more\r\nbrilliant up here than when seen from the valley, and it was easy to\r\nimagine that, standing on the extreme summit, one might touch them with\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\nMany hours of that night I passed under the sky and the stars, examining\r\nmy conscience and questioning my heart. I felt as if in church, kneeling\r\nbefore the altar and feeling the awful presence of the Lord. And at last\r\nmy soul was filled with a divine peace, and as an innocent child presses\r\nits mother\'s breast, even so I leaned my head upon thine, O Nature,\r\nmother of us all!\r\n\r\n23\r\n\r\nI had not before seen a dawn so glorious! The mountains were rose-red,\r\nand seemed almost transparent. The atmosphere was of a silver lucidity,\r\nand so fresh and pure that with every breath I seemed to be taking new\r\nlife. The dew, heavy and white, clung to the scanty grass-blades like\r\nrain and dripped from the sides of the rocks.\r\n\r\nIt was while engaged in my morning devotions that I involuntarily became\r\nacquainted with my neighbours. All night long the marmots had squealed,\r\ngreatly to my dismay, and they were now capering to and fro like hares.\r\nOverhead the brown hawks sailed in circles with an eye to the birds\r\nflitting among the bushes and the wood-mice racing along the rocks.\r\nNow and again a troop of chamois passed near, on their way to the\r\nfeeding-grounds on the cliffs, and high above all I saw a single eagle\r\nrising into the sky, higher and higher, as a soul flies heavenward when\r\npurged of sin.\r\n\r\nI was still kneeling when the silence was broken by the sound of voices.\r\nI looked about, but, although I could distinctly hear the voices and\r\ncatch snatches of song, I saw no one. The sounds seemed to come from the\r\nheart of the mountain and, remembering the malevolent powers that infest\r\nthe place, I repeated a prayer against the Evil One and awaited the\r\nevent.\r\n\r\nAgain the singing was heard, ascending from a deep chasm, and presently\r\nI saw rising out of it three female figures. As soon as they saw me they\r\nceased singing and uttered shrill screams. By this sign I knew them to\r\nbe daughters of the earth, and thought they might be Christians, and so\r\nwaited for them to approach.\r\n\r\nAs they drew near I observed that they carried baskets on their heads,\r\nand that they were tall, good-looking lasses, light-haired, brown in\r\ncomplexion and black-eyed. Setting their baskets upon the ground, they\r\ngreeted me humbly and kissed my hands, after which they opened the\r\nbaskets and displayed the good things they had brought me--milk, cream,\r\ncheese, butter and cakes.\r\n\r\nSeating themselves upon the ground, they told me they were from the\r\nGreen Lake, and said they were glad to have a \'mountain brother\' again,\r\nespecially so young and handsome a one; and in saying so there were\r\nmerry twinkles in their dark eyes and smiles on their red lips, which\r\npleased me exceedingly.\r\n\r\nI inquired if they were not afraid to live in the wilderness, at which\r\nthey laughed, showing their white teeth. They said they had a hunter\'s\r\ngun in their cabin to keep off bears, and knew several powerful\r\nsentences and anathemas against demons. Nor were they very lonely, they\r\nadded, for every Saturday the boys from the valley came up to hunt wild\r\nbeasts, and then all made merry. I learned from them that meadows and\r\ncabins were common among the rocks, where herdsmen and herdswomen lived\r\nduring the whole summer. The finest meadows, they said, belonged to the\r\nmonastery, and lay but a short distance away.\r\n\r\nThe pleasant chatting of the maidens greatly delighted me, and the\r\nsolitude began to be less oppressive. Having received the benediction,\r\nthey kissed my hand and went away as they had come, laughing, singing\r\nand shouting in the joy of youth and health. So much I have already\r\nobserved: the people in the mountains lead a better and happier life\r\nthan those in the damp, deep valleys below. Also, they seem purer in\r\nheart and mind, and that may be due to their living so much nearer to\r\nHeaven, which some of the brothers say approaches more closely to the\r\nearth here than at any other place in the world excepting Rome.\r\n\r\n24\r\n\r\nThe maidens having gone, I stowed away the provisions which they had\r\nbrought me, and, taking a short pointed spade and a bag, went in search\r\nof the gentiana roots. They grew in abundance, and my back soon began\r\nto ache from stooping and digging; but I continued the labour, for I\r\ndesired to send a good quantity to the monastery to attest my zeal and\r\nobedience. I had gone a long distance from my cabin without observing\r\nthe direction which I had taken, when suddenly I found myself on the\r\nbrink of an abyss so deep and terrible that I recoiled with a cry of\r\nhorror. At the bottom of this chasm, so far below my feet that I was\r\ngiddy to look down, a small circular lake was visible, like the eye of\r\na fiend. On the shore of it, near a cliff overhanging the water, stood a\r\ncabin, from the stone-weighted roof of which rose a thin column of blue\r\nsmoke. About the cabin, in the narrow and sterile pasture, a few cows\r\nand sheep were grazing. What a dreadful place for a human habitation!\r\n\r\nI was still gazing down with fear into this gulf when I was again\r\nstartled: I heard a voice distinctly call a name! The sound came from\r\nbehind me, and the name was uttered with so caressing sweetness that I\r\nhastened to cross myself as a protection from the wiles of the fairies\r\nwith their spells and enchantments. Soon I heard the voice again, and\r\nthis time it caused my heart to beat so that I was near suffocation, for\r\nit was Benedicta\'s! Benedicta in this wilderness, and I alone with her!\r\nSurely I now had need of thy guidance, blessed Franciscus, to keep, my\r\nfeet in the path of the Divine purpose.\r\n\r\nI turned about and saw her. She was now springing from rock to rock,\r\nlooking backward and calling the name that was strange to me. When she\r\nsaw that I looked at her she stood motionless. I walked to her, greeting\r\nher in the name of the Blessed Virgin, though, God forgive me! hardly\r\nable in the tumult of my emotions to articulate that holy title.\r\n\r\nAh, how changed the poor child was! The lovely face was as pale as\r\nmarble; the large eyes were sunken and inexpressibly sad. Her beautiful\r\nhair alone was unaltered, flowing over her shoulders like threads of\r\ngold. We stood looking at each other, silent from surprise; then I again\r\naddressed her: \'Is it, then, you, Benedicta, who live in the cabin down\r\nthere by the Black Lake--near the waters of Avemus? And is your father\r\nwith you?\'\r\n\r\nShe made no reply, but I observed a quivering about her delicate mouth,\r\nas when a child endeavours to refrain from weeping. I repeated my\r\nquestion: \'Is your father with you?\'\r\n\r\nShe answered faintly, in a tone that was hardly more than a sigh:\r\n\r\n\'My father is dead.\'\r\n\r\nI felt a sudden pain in my very heart, and was for some moments unable\r\nto speak further, quite overcome by compassion. Benedicta had turned\r\naway her face to hide her tears, and her fragile frame was shaken by her\r\nsobs. I could no longer restrain myself. Stepping up to her, I took her\r\nhand in mine, and, trying to crush back into my secret heart every human\r\ndesire, and address her in words of religious consolation, said: \'My\r\nchild--dear Benedicta--your father is gone from you, but another Father\r\nremains who will protect you every day of your life. And as far as may\r\naccord with His holy will I, too, good and beautiful maiden, help you to\r\nendure your great affliction. He whom you mourn is not lost; he is gone\r\nto the mercy seat, and God will be gracious to him.\'\r\n\r\nBut my words seemed only to awaken her sleeping grief. She threw herself\r\nupon the ground and gave way to her tears, sobbing so violently that I\r\nwas filled with alarm. O Mother of Mercy! how can I bear the memory\r\nof the anguish I suffered in seeing this beautiful and innocent child\r\noverwhelmed with so great a flood of grief? I bent over her, and my own\r\ntears fell upon her golden hair. My heart urged me to lift her from\r\nthe earth, but my hands were powerless to move. At length she composed\r\nherself somewhat and spoke, but as if she were talking to herself rather\r\nthan to me: \'Oh, my father, my poor, heart-broken father! Yes, he is\r\ndead--they killed him--he died long ago of grief. My beautiful mother,\r\ntoo, died of grief--of grief and remorse for some great sin, I know\r\nnot what, which he had forgiven her. He could only be compassionate and\r\nmerciful. His heart was too tender to let him kill a worm or a beetle,\r\nand he was compelled to kill men. His father and his father\'s father had\r\nlived and died in the Galgenberg. They were hangmen all, and the awful\r\ninheritance fell to him: there was no escape, for the terrible people\r\nheld him to the trade. I have heard him say that he was often tempted to\r\nkill himself, and but for me I am sure he would have done so. He could\r\nnot leave me to starve, though he had to see me reviled, and at last, O\r\nHoly Virgin! publicly disgraced for that of which I was not guilty.\'\r\n\r\nAs Benedicta made this reference to the great injustice that she had\r\nbeen made to suffer, her white cheeks kindled to crimson with the\r\nrecollection of the shame which for her father\'s sake she had, at the\r\ntime of it, so differently endured.\r\n\r\nDuring the narrative of her grief she had partly risen and had turned\r\nher beautiful face more and more toward me as her confidence had grown;\r\nbut now she veiled it with her hair, and would have turned her back but\r\nthat I gently prevented her and spoke some words of comfort, though God\r\nknows my own heart was near breaking through sympathy with hers. After\r\na few moments she resumed: \'Alas, my poor father! he was unhappy every\r\nway. Not even the comfort of seeing his child baptised was granted him.\r\nI was a hangman\'s daughter, and my parents were forbidden to present me\r\nfor baptism; nor could any priest be found who was willing to bless me\r\nin the name of the Holy Trinity. So they gave me the name Benedicta, and\r\nblessed me themselves, over and over again.\r\n\r\n\'I was only an infant when my beautiful mother died. They buried her\r\nin unconsecrated ground. She could not go to the Heavenly Father in the\r\nmansions above, but was thrust into the flames. While she was dying my\r\nfather had hastened to the Reverend Superior, imploring him to send a\r\npriest with the sacrament. His prayer was denied. No priest came, and my\r\npoor father closed her eyes himself, while his own were blind with tears\r\nof anguish for her terrible fate.\r\n\r\n\'And all alone he had to dig her grave. He had no other place than near\r\nthe gallows, where he had so often buried the hanged and the accurst.\r\nWith his own hands he had to place her in that unholy ground, nor could\r\nany masses be said for her suffering soul.\r\n\r\n\'I well remember how my dear father took me then to the image of the\r\nHoly Virgin and bade me kneel, and, joining my little hands, taught me\r\nto pray for my poor mother, who had stood undefended before the terrible\r\nJudge of the Dead. This I have done every morning and evening since that\r\nday, and now I pray for both; for my father also has died unshriven, and\r\nhis soul is not with God, but burns in unceasing fire.\r\n\r\n\'When he was dying I ran to the Superior, just as he had done for my\r\ndear mother. I besought him on my knees. I prayed and wept and embraced\r\nhis feet, and would have kissed his hand but that he snatched it away.\r\nHe commanded me to go.\'\r\n\r\nAs Benedicta proceeded with her narrative she gained courage. She rose\r\nto her feet and stood erect, threw back her beautiful head and lifted\r\nher eyes to the heavens as if recounting her wrongs to God\'s high angels\r\nand ministers of doom. She stretched forth her bare arms in gestures of\r\nso natural force and grace that I was filled with astonishment, and\r\nher unstudied words came from her lips with an eloquence of which I had\r\nnever before had any conception. I dare not think it inspiration, for,\r\nGod forgive us all! every word was an unconscious arraignment of Him and\r\nHis Holy Church; yet surely no mortal with lips untouched by a live coal\r\nfrom the altar ever so spake before! In the presence of this strange and\r\ngifted being I so felt my own unworth that I had surely knelt, as before\r\na blessed saint, but that she suddenly concluded, with a pathos that\r\ntouched me to tears.\r\n\r\n\'The cruel people killed him,\' she said, with a sob in the heart of\r\nevery word. \'They laid hands upon me whom he loved. They charged me\r\nfalsely with a foul crime. They attired me in a garment of dishonour,\r\nand put a crown of straw upon my head, and hung about my neck the black\r\ntablet of shame. They spat upon me and reviled me, and compelled him\r\nto lead me to the pillory, where I was bound and struck with whips\r\nand stones. That broke his great, good heart, and so he died, and I am\r\nalone.\'\r\n\r\n25\r\n\r\nWhen Benedicta had finished I remained silent, for in the presence of\r\nsuch a sorrow what could I say? For such wounds as hers religion has\r\nno balm. As I thought of the cruel wrongs of this humble and harmless\r\nfamily there came into my heart a feeling of wild rebellion against\r\nthe world, against the Church, against God! They were brutally unjust,\r\nhorribly, devilishly unjust!--God, the Church, and the world.\r\n\r\nOur very surroundings--the stark and soulless wilderness, perilous with\r\nprecipices and bleak with everlasting snows--seemed a visible embodiment\r\nof the woeful life to which the poor child had been condemned from\r\nbirth; and truly this was more than fancy, for since her father\'s death\r\nhad deprived her of even so humble a home as the hangman\'s hovel she had\r\nbeen driven to these eternal solitudes by the stress of want. But below\r\nus were pleasant villages, fertile fields, green gardens, and homes\r\nwhere peace and plenty abided all the year.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, when Benedicta was somewhat composed, I asked her if she\r\nhad anyone with her for protection.\r\n\r\n\'I have none,\' she replied. But observing my look of pain, she added:\r\n\'I have always lived in lonely, accurst places; I am accustomed to that.\r\nNow that my father is dead, there is no one who cares even to speak to\r\nme, nor any whom I care to talk with--except you.\' After a pause she\r\nsaid: \'True, there is one who cares to see me, but he----\'\r\n\r\nHere she broke off, and I did not press her to explain lest it should\r\nembarrass her. Presently she said: \'I knew yesterday that you were here.\r\nA boy came for some milk and butter for you. If you were not a holy man\r\nthe boy would not have come to me for your food. As it is, you cannot\r\nbe harmed by the evil which attaches to everything I have or do. Are\r\nyou sure, though, that you made the sign of the cross over the food\r\nyesterday?\'\r\n\r\n\'Had I known that it came from you, Benedicta, that precaution would\r\nhave been omitted,\' I answered.\r\n\r\nShe looked at me with beaming eyes, and said:\r\n\r\n\'Oh, dear sir, dear Brother!\'\r\n\r\nAnd both the look and the words gave me the keenest delight--as, in\r\ntruth, do all this saintly creature\'s words and ways.\r\n\r\nI inquired what had brought her to the cliff-top, and who the person was\r\nthat I had heard her calling.\r\n\r\n\'It is no person,\' she answered, smiling; \'it is only my goat. She has\r\nstrayed away, and I was searching for her among the rocks.\'\r\n\r\nThen nodding to me as if about to say farewell, she turned to go, but I\r\ndetained her, saying that I would assist her to look for the goat.\r\n\r\nWe soon discovered the animal in a crevice of rock, and so glad was\r\nBenedicta to find her humble companion that she knelt by its side, put\r\nher arms about its neck and called it by many endearing names. I thought\r\nthis very charming, and could not help looking upon the group with\r\nobvious admiration.\r\n\r\nBenedicta, observing it, said: \'Her mother fell from a cliff and broke\r\nher neck. I took the little one and brought it up on milk, and she\r\nis very fond of me. One who lives alone as I do values the love of a\r\nfaithful animal.\'\r\n\r\nWhen the maiden was about to leave me I gained courage to speak to her\r\nof what had been so long in my mind. I said: \'It is true, is it not,\r\nBenedicta, that on the night of the festival you went to meet the\r\ndrunken boys in order to save your father from harm?\'\r\n\r\nShe looked at me in great astonishment. \'For what other reason could you\r\nsuppose I went?\'\r\n\r\n\'I could not think of any other,\' I replied, in some confusion.\r\n\r\n\'And now good-bye, Brother,\' she said, moving away.\r\n\r\n\'Benedicta,\' I cried. She paused and turned her head.\r\n\r\n\'Next Sunday I shall preach to the dairy women at the Green Lake; will\r\nyou come?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, no, dear Brother,\' she replied hesitating and in low tones.\r\n\r\n\'You will not come?\'\r\n\r\n\'I should like to come, but my presence would frighten away the dairy\r\nwomen and others whom your goodness would bring there to hear you. Your\r\ncharity to me would cause you trouble. I pray you, sir, accept thanks,\r\nbut I cannot come.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then I shall come to you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Beware, oh pray, beware!\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall come.\'\r\n\r\n26\r\n\r\nThe boy had taught me how to prepare a cake. I knew all that went to the\r\nmaking of it, and the right proportions, yet when I tried to make it I\r\ncould not. All that I was able to make was a smoky, greasy pap, more fit\r\nfor the mouth of Satan than for a pious son of the Church and follower\r\nof Saint Franciscus. My failure greatly discouraged me, yet it did not\r\ndestroy my appetite; so, taking some stale bread, I dipped it in sour\r\nmilk and was about to make my stomach do penance for its many sins, when\r\nBenedicta came with a basketful of good things from her dairy. Ah, the\r\ndear child! I fear that it was not with my heart only that I greeted her\r\nthat blessed morning.\r\n\r\nObserving the smoky mass in the pan, she smiled, and quietly throwing\r\nit to the birds (which may Heaven guard!) she cleansed the pan at the\r\nspring, and, returning arranged the fire. She then prepared the material\r\nfor a fresh cake. Taking two handfuls of flour, she put it into an\r\nearthen bowl, and upon the top of it poured a cup of cream. Adding a\r\npinch of salt, she mixed the whole vigorously with her slender white\r\nhands until it became a soft, swelling dough. She next greased the pan\r\nwith a piece of yellow butter, and, pouring the dough into it, placed\r\nit on the fire. When the heat had penetrated the dough, causing it to\r\nexpand and rise above the sides of the pan, she deftly pierced it here\r\nand there that it should not burst, and when it was well browned she\r\ntook it up and set it before me, all unworthy as I was. I invited her\r\nto share the meal with me, but she would not. She insisted, too, that I\r\nshould cross myself before partaking of anything that she had brought me\r\nor prepared, lest some evil come to me because of the ban upon her;\r\nbut this I would not consent to do. While I ate she culled flowers from\r\namong the rocks, and, making a wreath, hung it upon the cross in front\r\nof the cabin; after which, when I had finished, she employed herself in\r\ncleansing the dishes and arranging everything in order as it should\r\nbe, so that I imagined myself far more comfortable than before, even in\r\nmerely looking about me. When there was nothing more to be done, and my\r\nconscience would not permit me to invent reasons for detaining her, she\r\nwent away, and O my Saviour! how dismal and dreary seemed the day when\r\nshe was gone. Ah, Benedicta, Benedicta, what is this that thou hast done\r\nto me?--making that sole service of the Lord to which I am dedicated\r\nseem less happy and less holy than a herdsman\'s humble life here in the\r\nwilderness with thee!\r\n\r\n27\r\n\r\nLife up here is less disagreeable than I thought. What seemed to me\r\na dreary solitude seems now less dismal and desolate. This mountain\r\nwilderness, which at first filled me with awe, gradually reveals its\r\nbenign character. It is marvellously beautiful in its grandeur, with a\r\nbeauty which purifies and elevates the soul. One can read in it, as in a\r\nbook, the praises of its Creator. Daily, while digging gentiana roots, I\r\ndo not fail to listen to the voice of the wilderness and to compose and\r\nchasten my soul more and more.\r\n\r\nIn these mountains are no feathered songsters. The birds here utter only\r\nshrill cries. The flowers, too, are without fragrance, but wondrously\r\nbeautiful, shining with the fire and gold of stars. I have seen slopes\r\nand heights here which doubtless were never trodden by any human foot.\r\nThey seem to me sacred, the touch of the Creator still visible upon\r\nthem, as when they came from His hand.\r\n\r\nGame is in great abundance. Chamois are sometimes seen in such droves\r\nthat the very hillsides seem to move. There are steinbocks, veritable\r\nmonsters, but as yet, thank Heaven, I have seen no bears. Marmots play\r\nabout me like kittens, and eagles, the grandest creatures in this high\r\nworld, nest in the cliffs to be as near the sky as they can get.\r\n\r\nWhen fatigued, I stretch myself on the Alpine grass, which is as\r\nfragrant as the most precious spices. I close my eyes and hear the wind\r\nwhisper through the tall stems, and in my heart is peace. Blessed be the\r\nLord!\r\n\r\n28\r\n\r\nEvery morning the dairy women come to my cabin, their merry shouts\r\nringing in the air and echoed from the hills. They bring fresh milk,\r\nbutter and cheese, chat a little while and go away. Each day they relate\r\nsomething new that has occurred in the mountains or been reported from\r\nthe villages below. They are joyous and happy, and look forward with\r\ndelight to Sunday, when there will be divine service in the morning and\r\na dance in the evening.\r\n\r\nAlas, these happy people are not free of the sin of bearing\r\nfalse witness against their neighbour. They have spoken to me of\r\nBenedicta--called her a disgraceful wench, a hangman\'s daughter and (my\r\nheart rebels against its utterance) the mistress of Rochus! The pillory,\r\nthey said, was made for such as she.\r\n\r\nHearing these maidens talk so bitterly and falsely of one whom they so\r\nlittle knew, it was with difficulty that I mastered my indignation. But\r\nin pity of their ignorance I reprimanded them gently and kindly. It was\r\nwrong, I said, to condemn a fellow-being unheard. It was unchristian to\r\nspeak ill of any one.\r\n\r\nThey do not understand. It surprises them that I defend a person like\r\nBenedicta--one who, as they truly say, has been publicly disgraced and\r\nhas not a friend in the world.\r\n\r\n29\r\n\r\nThis morning I visited the Black Lake. It is indeed an awful and\r\naccursed place, fit for the habitation of the damned. And there lives\r\nthe poor forsaken child! Approaching the cabin, I could see a fire\r\nburning on the hearth, and over it was suspended a kettle. Benedicta was\r\nseated on a low stool, looking into the flames. Her face was illuminated\r\nwith a crimson glow, and I could observe heavy tear-drops on her cheeks.\r\n\r\nNot wishing to see her secret sorrow, I hastened to make known my\r\npresence, and addressed her as gently as I could. She was startled, but\r\nwhen she saw who it was, smiled and blushed. She rose and came to greet\r\nme, and I began speaking to her almost at random, in order that she\r\nmight recover her composure. I spoke as a brother might speak to his\r\nsister, yet earnestly, for my heart was full of compassion.\r\n\r\n\'O Benedicta,\' I said, I know your heart, and it has more love for that\r\nwild youth Rochus than for our dear and blessed Saviour. I know how\r\nwillingly you bore infamy and disgrace, sustained by the thought that he\r\nknew you innocent. Far be it from me to condemn you, for what is holier\r\nor purer than a maiden\'s love? I would only warn and save you from the\r\nconsequence of having given it to one so unworthy.\'\r\n\r\nShe listened with her head bowed, and said nothing, but I could hear\r\nher sighs. I saw, too, that she trembled. I continued: \'Benedicta, the\r\npassion which fills your heart may prove your destruction in this life\r\nand hereafter. Young Rochus is not one who will make you his wife in the\r\nsight of God and Man. Why did he not stand forth and defend you when you\r\nwere falsely accused?\'\r\n\r\n\'He was not there,\' she said, lifting her eyes to mine; \'he and his\r\nfather were at Salzburg. He knew nothing till they told him.\'\r\n\r\nMay God forgive me if at this I felt no joy in another\'s acquittal of\r\nthe heavy sin with which I had charged him. I stood a moment irresolute,\r\nwith my head bowed, silent.\r\n\r\n\'But, Benedicta,\' I resumed, \'will he take for a wife one whose good\r\nname has been blackened in the sight of his family and his neighbours?\r\nNo, he does not seek you with an honourable purpose. O Benedicta,\r\nconfide in me. Is it not as I say?\'\r\n\r\nBut she remained silent, nor could I draw from her a single word. She\r\nwould only sigh and tremble; she seemed unable to speak. I saw that she\r\nwas too weak to resist the temptation to love young Rochus; nay, I saw\r\nthat her whole heart was bound up in him, and my soul melted with pity\r\nand sorrow--pity for her and sorrow for myself, for I felt that my power\r\nwas unequal to the command that had been laid upon me. My agony was so\r\nkeen that I could hardly refrain from crying out.\r\n\r\nI went from her cabin, but did not return to my own. I wandered about\r\nthe haunted shore of the Black Lake for hours, without aim or purpose.\r\n\r\nReflecting bitterly upon my failure, and beseeching God for greater\r\ngrace and strength, it was revealed to me that I was an unworthy\r\ndisciple of the Lord and a faithless son of the Church. I became more\r\nkeenly conscious than I ever had been before of the earthly nature of my\r\nlove for Benedicta, and of its sinfulness. I felt that I had not given\r\nmy whole heart to God, but was clinging to a temporal and human hope.\r\nIt was plain to me that unless my love for the sweet child should be\r\nchanged to a purely spiritual affection, purified from all the dross of\r\npassion, I could never receive holy orders, but should remain always a\r\nmonk and always a sinner. These reflections caused me great torment,\r\nand in my despair I cast myself down upon the earth, calling aloud to\r\nmy Saviour. In this my greatest trial I clung to the Cross. \'Save me, O\r\nLord!\' I cried. \'I am engulfed in a great passion--save me, oh, save me,\r\nor I perish forever!\'\r\n\r\nAll that night I struggled and prayed and fought against the evil\r\nspirits in my soul, with their suggestions of recreancy to the dear\r\nChurch whose child I am.\r\n\r\n\'The Church,\' they whispered, \'has servants enough. You are not as yet\r\nirrevocably bound to celibacy. You can procure a dispensation from your\r\nmonastic vows and remain here in the mountains, a layman. You can learn\r\nthe craft of the hunter or the herdsman, and be ever near Benedicta to\r\nguard and guide her--perhaps in time to win her love from Rochus and\r\ntake her for your wife.\'\r\n\r\nTo these temptations I opposed my feeble strength and such aid as\r\nthe blessed Saint gave me in my great trial. The contest was long and\r\nagonising, and more than once, there in the darkness and the wilderness,\r\nwhich rang with my cries, I was near surrender; but at the dawning of\r\nthe day I became more tranquil, and peace once more filled my heart,\r\neven as the golden light filled the great gorges of the mountain where\r\nbut a few moments before were the darkness and the mist. I thought then\r\nof the suffering and death of our Saviour, who died for the redemption\r\nof the world, and most fervently I prayed that Heaven would grant me the\r\ngreat boon to die likewise, in a humbler way, even though it were for\r\nbut one suffering being--Benedicta.\r\n\r\nMay the Lord hear my prayer!\r\n\r\n30\r\n\r\nThe night before the Sunday on which I was to hold divine service great\r\nfires were kindled on the cliffs--a signal for the young men in the\r\nvalley to come up to the mountain dairies. They came in great numbers,\r\nshouting and screaming, and were greeted with songs and shrill cries by\r\nthe dairy maidens, who swung flaming torches that lit up the faces\r\nof the great rocks and sent gigantic shadows across them. It was a\r\nbeautiful sight. These are indeed a happy people.\r\n\r\nThe monastery boy came in with the rest. He will remain over Sunday,\r\nand, returning, will take back the roots that I have dug. He gave me\r\nmuch news from the monastery. The reverend Superior is living at Saint\r\nBartholom\xe6, fishing and hunting. Another thing--one which gives me great\r\nalarm--is that the Saltmaster\'s son, young Rochus, is in the mountains\r\nnot far from the Black Lake. It seems he has a hunting-lodge on the\r\nupper cliff, and a path leads from it directly to the lake. The boy told\r\nme this, but did not observe how I trembled when hearing it. Would that\r\nan angel with a flaming sword might guard the path to the lake, and to\r\nBenedicta!\r\n\r\nThe shouting and singing continued during the whole night, and between\r\nthis and the agitation in my soul I did not close my eyes. Early the\r\nnext morning the boys and girls arrived in crowds from all directions.\r\nThe maidens wore silken kerchiefs twisted prettily about their heads,\r\nand had decorated themselves and their escorts with flowers.\r\n\r\nNot being an ordained priest, it was not permitted me either to read\r\nmass or to preach a sermon, but I prayed with them and spoke to them\r\nwhatever my aching heart found to say. I spoke to them of our sinfulness\r\nand God\'s great mercy; of our harshness to one another and the Saviour\'s\r\nlove for us all; of His infinite compassion. As my words echoed from the\r\nabyss below and the heights above I felt as if I were lifted out of\r\nthis world of suffering and sin and borne away on angel\'s wings to the\r\nradiant spheres beyond the sky! It was a solemn service, and my little\r\ncongregation was awed into devotion and seemed to feel as if it stood in\r\nthe Holy of Holies.\r\n\r\nThe service being concluded, I blessed the people and they quietly went\r\naway. They had not been long gone before I heard the lads send forth\r\nringing shouts, but this did not displease me. Why should they not\r\nrejoice? Is not cheerfulness the purest praise a human heart can give?\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I went down to Benedicta\'s cabin and found her at the\r\ndoor, making a wreath of edelweiss for the image of the Blessed Virgin,\r\nintertwining the snowy flowers with a purple blossom that looked like\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nSeating myself beside her, I looked on at her beautiful work in silence,\r\nbut in my soul was a wild tumult of emotion and a voice that cried:\r\n\'Benedicta, my love, my soul, I love you more than life! I love you\r\nabove all things on earth and in Heaven!\'\r\n\r\n31\r\n\r\nThe Superior sent for me, and with a strange foreboding I followed his\r\nmessenger down the difficult way to the lake and embarked in the boat.\r\nOccupied with gloomy reflections and presentiments of impending evil,\r\nI hardly observed that we had left the shore before the sound of merry\r\nvoices apprised me of our arrival at St. Bartholom\xe6. On the beautiful\r\nmeadow surrounding the dwelling of the Superior were a great number of\r\npeople--priests, friars, mountaineers and hunters. Many were there who\r\nhad come from afar with large retinues of servants and boys. In the\r\nhouse was a great bustle--a confusion and a hurrying to and fro, as\r\nduring a fair. The doors stood wide open, and people ran in and out,\r\nclamouring noisily. The dogs yelped and howled as loud as they could. On\r\na stand under the oak was a great cask of beer, and many of the people\r\nwere gathered about it, drinking. Inside the house, too, there seemed to\r\nbe much drinking, for I saw many men near the windows with mighty cups\r\nin their hands. On entering, I encountered throngs of servants carrying\r\ndishes of fish and game. I asked one of them when I could see the\r\nSuperior. He answered that His Reverence would be down immediately after\r\nthe meal, and I concluded to wait in the hall. The walls were hung with\r\npictures of some large fish which had been caught in the lake. Below\r\neach picture the weight of the monster and the date of its capture,\r\ntogether with the name of the person taking it, were inscribed in\r\nlarge letters. I could not help interpreting these records--perhaps\r\nuncharitably--as intimations to all good Christians to pray for the\r\nsouls of those whose names were inscribed.\r\n\r\nAfter more than an hour the Superior descended the stairs. I stepped\r\nforward, saluting him humbly, as became my position. He nodded, eyed\r\nme sharply, and directed me to go to his apartment immediately after\r\nsupper. This I did.\r\n\r\n\'How about your soul, my son Ambrosius?\' he asked me, solemnly. \'Has the\r\nLord shown you grace? Have you endured the probation?\' Humbly, with my\r\nhead bowed, I answered: \'Most reverend Father, God in my solitude has\r\ngiven me knowledge.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of what? Of your guilt?\' This I affirmed.\r\n\r\n\'Praise be to God!\' exclaimed the Superior. \'I knew, my son, that\r\nsolitude would speak to your soul with the tongue of an angel. I have\r\ngood tidings for you. I have written in your behalf to the Bishop of\r\nSalzburg. He summons you to his palace. He will consecrate you and give\r\nyou holy orders in person, and you will remain in his city. Prepare\r\nyourself, for in three days you are to leave us.\'\r\n\r\nThe Superior looked sharply into my face again, but I did not permit him\r\nto see into my heart. I asked for his benediction, bowed and left him.\r\nAh, then, it was for this that I was summoned! I am to go away forever.\r\nI must leave my very life behind me; I must renounce my care and\r\nprotection of Benedicta. God help her and me!\r\n\r\n32\r\n\r\nI am once more in my mountain home, but tomorrow I leave it forever. But\r\nwhy am I sad? Does not a great blessing await me? Have I not ever looked\r\nforward to the moment of my consecration with longing, believing it\r\nwould bring me the supreme happiness of my life? And now that this great\r\njoy is almost within my grasp, I am sad beyond measure.\r\n\r\nCan I approach the altar of the Lord with a lie on my lips? Can I\r\nreceive the holy sacrament as an impostor? The holy oil upon my forehead\r\nwould turn to fire and burn into my brain, and I should be for ever\r\ndamned.\r\n\r\nI might fall upon my knees before the Bishop and say: \'Expel me, for\r\nI do not seek after the love of Christ, nor after holy and heavenly\r\nthings, but after the things of this world.\'\r\n\r\nIf I so spoke, I should be punished, but I could endure that without a\r\nmurmur.\r\n\r\nIf only I were sinless and could rightly become a priest, I could be of\r\ngreat service to the poor child. I should be able to give her infinite\r\nblessings and consolations. I could be her confessor and absolve her\r\nfrom sin, and, if I should outlive her--which God forbid!--might by my\r\nprayers even redeem her soul from Purgatory. I could read masses for the\r\nsouls of her poor dead parents, already in torment.\r\n\r\nAbove all, if I succeeded in preserving her from that one great and\r\ndestructive sin for which she secretly longs; if I could take her with\r\nme and place her under thy protection, O Blessed Virgin, that would be\r\nhappiness indeed.\r\n\r\nBut where is the sanctuary that would receive the hangman\'s daughter?\r\nI know it but too well: when I am gone from here, the Evil One, in the\r\nwinning shape he has assumed, will prevail, and she will be lost in time\r\nand in eternity.\r\n\r\n33\r\n\r\nI have been at Benedicta\'s cabin.\r\n\r\n\'Benedicta,\' I said, \'I am going away from here--away from the\r\nmountains--away from you.\'\r\n\r\nShe grew pale, but said nothing. For a moment I was overcome with\r\nemotion; I seemed to choke, and could not continue. Presently I said:\r\n\'Poor child, what will become of you? I know that your love for Rochus\r\nis strong and, love is like a torrent which nothing can stay. There is\r\nno safety for you but in clinging to the cross of our Saviour. Promise me\r\nthat you will do so--do not let me go away in misery, Benedicta.\'\r\n\r\n\'Am I, then, so wicked?\' she said, without lifting her eyes from the\r\nground. \'Can I not be trusted?\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, but, Benedicta, the enemy is strong, and you have a traitor to\r\nunbar the gates. Your own heart, poor child, will at last betray you.\'\r\n\r\n\'He will not harm me,\' she murmured. \'You wrong him, sir, indeed you\r\ndo.\'\r\n\r\nBut I knew that I did not, and was all the more concerned to judge that\r\nthe wolf would use the arts of the fox. Before the sacred purity of\r\nthis maiden the base passions of the youth had not dared to declare\r\nthemselves. But none the less I knew that an hour would come when she\r\nwould have need of all her strength, and it would fail her. I grasped\r\nher arm and demanded that she take an oath that she would throw herself\r\ninto the waters of the Black Lake rather than into the arms of Rochus.\r\nBut she would not reply. She remained silent, her eyes fixed upon mine\r\nwith a look of sadness and reproach which filled my mind with the most\r\nmelancholy thoughts, and, turning away, I left her.\r\n\r\n34\r\n\r\nLord, Saviour of my soul, whither hast Thou led me? Here am I in the\r\nculprit\'s tower, a condemned murderer, and to-morrow at sunrise I shall\r\nbe taken to the gallows and hanged! For who so slays a fellow being, he\r\nshall be slain; that is the law of God and man.\r\n\r\nOn this the last day of my life I have asked that I be permitted to\r\nwrite, and my prayer is granted. In the name of God and in the truth I\r\nshall now set down all that occurred.\r\n\r\nLeaving Benedicta, I returned to my cabin, and, having packed\r\neverything, waited for the boy. But he did not come: I should have to\r\nremain in the mountains another night. I grew restless. The cabin seemed\r\ntoo narrow to hold me; the air was too heavy and hot to sustain life.\r\nGoing outside, I lay upon a rock and looked up at the sky, dark and\r\nglittering with stars. But my soul was not in the heavens; it was at the\r\ncabin by the Black Lake.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I heard a faint, distant cry, like a human voice. I sat upright\r\nand listened, but all was still. It may have been, I thought, the note\r\nof some night-bird. I was about to lie down again, when the cry was\r\nrepeated, but it seemed to come from another direction. It was the\r\nvoice of Benedicta! It sounded again, and now it seemed to come from the\r\nair--from the sky above my head, and distinctly it called my name; but,\r\nO Mother of God, what anguish was in those tones!\r\n\r\nI leapt from the rock. \'Benedicta, Benedicta!\' I cried aloud. There was\r\nno reply.\r\n\r\n\'Benedicta, I am coming to thee, child!\'\r\n\r\nI sprang away in the darkness, along the path to the Black Lake. I ran\r\nand leapt, stumbling and falling over rocks and stumps of trees. My\r\nlimbs were bruised, my clothing was torn, but I gave no heed; Benedicta\r\nwas in distress, and I alone could save and guard her. I rushed on until\r\nI reached the Black Lake. But at the cabin all was quiet; there was\r\nneither light nor sound; everything was as peaceful as a house of God.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting a long time I left. The voice that I had heard calling me\r\ncould not have been Benedicta\'s, but must have been that of some evil\r\nspirit mocking me in my great sorrow. I meant to return to my cabin, but\r\nan invisible hand directed my steps another way; and although it led me\r\nto my death, I know it to have been the hand of the Lord.\r\n\r\nWalking on, hardly knowing whither, and unable to find the path by which\r\nI had descended, I found myself at the foot of a precipice. Here was a\r\nnarrow path leading steeply upward along the face of the cliff, and I\r\nbegan ascending it. After I had gone up some distance I looked above,\r\nand saw outlined against the starry sky a cabin perched upon the very\r\nverge. It flashed through my mind that this was the hunting-lodge of\r\nthe Saltmaster\'s son, and this the path by which he visited Benedicta.\r\nMerciful Father! he, Rochus, was certain to come this way; there could\r\nbe no other. I would wait for him here.\r\n\r\nI crouched in the shadow and waited, thinking what to say to him and\r\nimploring the Lord for inspiration to change his heart and turn him from\r\nhis evil purpose.\r\n\r\nBefore long I heard him approaching from above. I heard the stones\r\ndisplaced by his foot roll down the steep slopes and leap into the lake\r\nfar below. Then I prayed God that if I should be unable to soften the\r\nyouth\'s heart he might miss his footing and fall, too, like the stones;\r\nfor it would be better that he should meet a sudden and impenitent\r\ndeath, and his soul be lost, than that he should live to destroy the\r\nsoul of an innocent girl.\r\n\r\nTurning at an angle of the rock, he stood directly before me as, rising,\r\nI stepped into the faint light of the new moon. He knew me at once, and\r\nin a haughty tone asked me what I wanted.\r\n\r\nI replied mildly, explaining why I had barred his way, and begging him\r\nto go back. He insulted and derided me.\r\n\r\n\'You miserable towler,\' he said, \'will you never cease meddling in my\r\naffairs? Because the mountain maids are so foolish as to praise your\r\nwhite teeth and your big black eyes, must you fancy yourself a man, and\r\nnot a monk? You are no more to women than a goat!\'\r\n\r\nI begged him to desist and to listen to me. I threw myself on my knees\r\nand implored him, however he might despise me and my humble though holy\r\nstation, to respect Benedicta and spare her. But he pushed me from\r\nhim with his foot upon my breast. No longer master of myself, I sprang\r\nerect, and called him an assassin and a villain.\r\n\r\nAt this he pulled a dagger from his belt, saying: \'I will send you to\r\nHell!\'\r\n\r\nQuick as a flash of lightning my hand was upon his wrist. I wrested the\r\nknife from him and flung it behind me, crying: \'Not with weapons,\r\nbut unarmed and equal, we will fight to the death, and the Lord shall\r\ndecide!\'\r\n\r\nWe sprang upon each other with the fury of wild animals, and were\r\ninstantly locked together with arms and hands. We struggled upward and\r\ndownward along the path, with the great wall of rock on one side, and\r\non the other the precipice, the abyss, the waters of the Black Lake! We\r\nwrithed and strained for the advantage; but the Lord was against me for\r\nHe permited my enemy to overcome me and throw me down on the edge of the\r\nprecipice. I was in the grasp of a strong enemy, whose eyes glowed\r\nlike coals of fire. His knee was on my breast and my head hung over the\r\nedge--my life was in his hands. I thought he would push me over, but he\r\nmade no attempt to do so. He held me there between life and death for a\r\ndreadful time, then said, in a low, hissing voice: \'You see, monk, if I\r\nbut move I can hurl you down the abyss like a stone. But I care not to\r\ntake your life, for it is no impediment to me. The girl belongs to me,\r\nand to me you shall leave her; do you understand?\'\r\n\r\nWith that he rose and left me, going down the path toward the lake. His\r\nfootfalls had long died away in the silent night before I was able to\r\nmove hand or foot. Great God! I surely did not deserve such defeat,\r\nhumiliation and pain. I had but wished to save a soul, yet Heaven\r\npermitted me to be conquered by him who would destroy it!\r\n\r\nFinally I was able to rise, although in great pain, for I was bruised by\r\nmy fall, and could still feel the fierce youth\'s knee upon my breast\r\nand his fingers about my throat. I walked with difficulty back along\r\nthe path, downward toward the lake. Wounded as I was, I would return to\r\nBenedicta\'s cabin and interpose my body between her and harm. But my\r\nprogress was slow, and I had frequently to rest; yet it was near dawn\r\nbefore I gave up the effort, convinced that I should be too late to do\r\nthe poor child the small service of yielding up my remnant of life in\r\nher defence.\r\n\r\nAt early dawn I heard Rochus returning, with a merry song upon his lips.\r\nI concealed myself behind a rock, though not in fear, and he passed\r\nwithout seeing me.\r\n\r\nAt this point there was a break in the wall of the cliff, the path\r\ncrossing a great crevice that clove the mountain as by a sword-stroke\r\nfrom the arm of a Titan. The bottom was strewn with loose boulders and\r\novergrown with brambles and shrubs, through which trickled a slender\r\nstream of water fed by the melting snows above. Here I remained for\r\nthree days and two nights. I heard the boy from the monastery calling\r\nmy name as he traversed the path searching for me, but I made no answer.\r\nNot once did I quench my burning thirst at the brook nor appease my\r\nhunger with blackberries that grew abundantly on every side. Thus I\r\nmortified the sinful flesh, killed rebellious nature and subdued my\r\nspirit to the Lord until at last I felt myself delivered from all evil,\r\nfreed from the bondage of an earthly love and prepared to devote my\r\nheart and soul and life to no woman but thee, O Blessed Virgin!\r\n\r\nThe Lord having wrought this miracle, my soul felt as light and free\r\nas if wings were lifting me to the skies. I praised the Lord in a loud\r\nvoice, shouting and rejoicing till the rocks rang with the sound. I\r\ncried: \'Hosanna! Hosanna! I was now prepared to go before the altar and\r\nreceive the holy oil upon my head. I was no longer myself. Ambrosius,\r\nthe poor erring monk, was dead; I was an instrument in the right hand of\r\nGod to execute His holy will. I prayed for the delivery of the soul of\r\nthe beautiful maiden, and as I prayed, behold! there appeared to me\r\nin the splendour and glory of Heaven the Lord Himself, attended by\r\ninnumerable angels, filling half the sky! A great rapture enthralled my\r\nsenses; I was dumb with happiness. With a smile of ineffable benignity\r\nGod spake to me:\r\n\r\n\'Because that thou hast been faithful to thy trust, and through all the\r\ntrials that I have sent upon thee hast not faltered, the salvation of\r\nthe sinless maiden\'s soul is now indeed given into thy hand.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thou, Lord, knowest,\' I replied, \'that I am without the means to do\r\nthis work, nor know I how it is to be done.\'\r\n\r\nThe Lord commanded me to rise and walk on, and, turning my face away\r\nfrom the glorious Presence, which filled the heart of the cloven\r\nmountain with light, I obeyed, leaving the scene of my purgation and\r\nregaining the path that led up the face of the cliff. I began the\r\nascent, walking on and on in the splendour of the sunset, reflected from\r\ncrimson clouds.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I felt impelled to stop and look down, and there at my feet,\r\nshining red in the cloudlight, as if stained with blood, lay the sharp\r\nknife of Rochus. Now I understood why the Lord had permitted that wicked\r\nyouth to conquer me, yet had moved him to spare my life. I had been\r\nreserved for a more glorious purpose. And so was placed in my hands the\r\nmeans to that sacred end. My God, my God, how mysterious are Thy ways!\r\n\r\n35\r\n\r\n\'You shall leave her to me.\' So had spoken the wicked youth while\r\nholding me between life and death at the precipice. He permitted me\r\nto live, not from Christian mercy, but because he despised my life, a\r\ntrivial thing to him, not worth taking. He was sure of his prey; it did\r\nnot matter if I were living or dead.\r\n\r\n\'You shall leave her to me.\' Oh, arrogant fool! Do you not know that the\r\nLord holds His hand over the flowers of the field and the young birds\r\nin the nest? Leave Benedicta to you?--permit you to destroy her body and\r\nher soul? Ah, you shall see how the hand of God shall be spread above\r\nher to guard and save. There is yet time--that soul is still spotless\r\nand undefiled. Forward, then, to fulfil the command of the Most High\r\nGod!\r\n\r\nI knelt upon the spot where God had given into my hand the means of her\r\ndeliverance. My soul was wholly absorbed in the mission entrusted to\r\nme. My heart was in ecstasy, and I saw plainly, as in a vision, the\r\ntriumphant completion of the act which I had still to do.\r\n\r\nI arose, and, concealing the knife in my robe, retraced my steps, going\r\ndownward toward the Black Lake. The new moon looked like a divine wound\r\nin the sky, as if some hand had plunged a dagger into Heaven\'s holy\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\nBenedicta\'s door was ajar, and I stood outside a long time, gazing upon\r\nthe beautiful picture presented to my eyes. A bright fire on the hearth\r\nlit up the room. Opposite the fire sat Benedicta, combing her long\r\ngolden hair. Unlike what it was the last time I had stood before her\r\ncabin and gazed upon it, her face was full of happiness and had a glory\r\nthat I had never imagined in it. A sensuous smile played about her\r\nlips while she sang in a low, sweet voice the air of a love song of the\r\npeople. Ah me! she was beautiful; she looked like a bride of Heaven. But\r\nthough her voice was that of an angel, it angered me, and I called out\r\nto her: \'What are you doing, Benedicta, so late in the evening? You sing\r\nas if you expected your lover, and arrange your hair as for a dance. It\r\nis but three days since I, your brother and only friend, left you, in\r\nsorrow and despair. And now you are as happy as a bride.\'\r\n\r\nShe sprang up and manifested great joy at seeing me again, and hastened\r\nto kiss my hands. But she had no sooner glanced into my face than she\r\nuttered a scream of terror and recoiled from me as if I had been a fiend\r\nfrom Hell!\r\n\r\nBut I approached her and asked: \'Why do you adorn yourself so late in\r\nthe night?--why are you so happy? Have the three days been long enough\r\nfor you to fall? Are you the mistress of Rochus?\' She stood staring at\r\nme in horror. She asked: \'Where have you been and why do you come? You\r\nlook so ill! Sit, sir, I pray you, and rest. You are pale and you shake\r\nwith cold. I will make you a warm drink and you will feel better.\'\r\n\r\nShe was silenced by my stern gaze. \'I have not come to rest and be\r\nnursed by you,\' I said. \'I am here because the Lord commands. Tell me\r\nwhy you sang.\'\r\n\r\nShe looked up at me with the innocent expression of a babe, and replied:\r\n\'Because I had for the moment forgotten that you were going away, and I\r\nwas happy.\'\r\n\r\n\'Happy?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes--he has been here.\'\r\n\r\n\'Who? Rochus?\'\r\n\r\nShe nodded. \'He was so good,\' she said. \'He will ask his father to\r\nconsent to see me, and perhaps take me to his great house and persuade\r\nthe Reverend Superior to remove the curse from my life. Would not that\r\nbe fine? But then.\' she added, with a sudden change of voice and manner,\r\nlowering her eyes, \'perhaps you would no longer care for me. It is\r\nbecause I am poor and friendless.\'\r\n\r\n\'What! he will persuade his father to befriend you?--to take you to his\r\nhome?--you, the hangman\'s daughter? He, this reckless youth, at war\r\nwith God and God\'s ministers, will move the Church! Oh, lie, lie, lie! O\r\nBenedicta--lost, betrayed Benedicta! By your smiles and by your tears I\r\nknow that you believe the monstrous promises of this infamous villain.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' she said, inclining her head as if she were making a confession\r\nof faith before the altar of the Lord, \'I believe him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Kneel, then,\' I cried, \'and praise the Lord for sending one of His\r\nchosen to save your soul from temporal and eternal perdition!\'\r\n\r\nAt these words she trembled as in great fear.\r\n\r\n\'What do you wish me to do?\' she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\'To pray that your sins may be forgiven.\'\r\n\r\nA sudden rapturous impulse seized my soul. \'I am a priest,\' I cried,\r\n\'anointed and ordained by God Himself, and in the name of the Father,\r\nand of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, I forgive you your only sin,\r\nwhich is your love. I give you absolution without repentance. I free\r\nyour soul from the taint of sin because you will atone for it with your\r\nblood and life.\'\r\n\r\nWith these words, I seized her and forced her down upon her knees. But\r\nshe wanted to live; she cried and wailed. She clung to my knees and\r\nentreated and implored in the name of God and the Blessed Virgin. Then\r\nshe sprang to her feet and attempted to run away. I seized her again,\r\nbut she broke away from my grasp and ran to the open door, crying:\r\n\'Rochus! Rochus! help, oh help!\'\r\n\r\nSpringing after her, I grasped her by the shoulder, turned her\r\nhalf-round and plunged the knife into her breast.\r\n\r\nI held her in my arms, pressed her against my heart and felt her warm\r\nblood upon my body. She opened her eyes and fixed upon me a look of\r\nreproach, as if I had robbed her of a life of happiness. Then her eyes\r\nslowly closed, she gave a long, shuddering sigh, her little head turned\r\nupon her shoulder, and so she died.\r\n\r\nI wrapped the beautiful body in a white sheet, leaving the face\r\nuncovered, and laid it upon the floor. But the blood tinged the linen,\r\nso I parted her long golden hair, spreading it over the crimson roses\r\nupon her breast. As I had made her a bride of Heaven, I took from the\r\nimage of the Virgin the wreath of edelweiss and placed it on Benedicta\'s\r\nbrow; and now I remembered the edelweiss which she had once brought me\r\nto comfort me in my penance.\r\n\r\nThen I stirred the fire, which cast upon the shrouded figure and the\r\nbeautiful face a rich red light, as if God\'s glory had descended there\r\nto enfold her. It was caught and tangled in the golden tresses that lay\r\nupon her breast, so that they looked a mass of curling flame.\r\n\r\nAnd so I left her.\r\n\r\n36\r\n\r\nI descended the mountain by precipitous paths, but the Lord guided my\r\nsteps so that I neither stumbled nor fell into the abyss. At the dawning\r\nof the day I arrived at the monastery, rang the bell and waited until\r\nthe gate was opened. The brother porter evidently thought me a fiend,\r\nfor he raised a howl that aroused the whole monastery. I went straight\r\nto the room of the Superior, stood before him in my bloodstained\r\ngarments, and, telling him for what deed the Lord had chosen me,\r\ninformed him that I was now an ordained priest. At this they seized me,\r\nput me into the tower, and, holding court upon me, condemned me to death\r\nas if I were a murderer. Oh, the fools, the poor demented fools!\r\n\r\nOne person has come to me to-day in my dungeon, who fell upon her\r\nknees before me, kissed my hands and adored me as God\'s chosen\r\ninstrument--Amula, the brown maiden. She alone has discovered that I\r\nhave done a great and glorious deed.\r\n\r\nI have asked Amula to chase away the vultures from my body, for\r\nBenedicta is in Heaven.\r\n\r\nI shall soon be with her. Praise be to God! Hosanna! Amen.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n[To this old manuscript are added the following lines in another hand:\r\n\'On the fifteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord, 1680, in this\r\nplace, Brother Ambrosius was hanged, and on the following day his body\r\nwas buried under the gallows, close to that of the girl Benedicta, whom\r\nhe killed. This Benedicta, though called the hangman\'s daughter, was (as\r\nis now known through declarations of the youth Rochus) the bastard child\r\nof the Saltmaster by the hangman\'s wife. It is also veritably attested\r\nby the same youth that the maiden cherished a secret and forbidden love\r\nfor him who slew her in ignorance of her passion. In all else Brother\r\nAmbrosius was a faithful servant of the Lord. Pray for him, pray for\r\nhim!]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Monk and The Hangman\'s Daughter, by \r\nAdolphe Danziger De Castro and Ambrose Bierce\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MONK ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 38602-8.txt or 38602-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/8/6/0/38602/\r\n\r\nProduced by David Widger\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
