K. S. M.\r\n\r\nPisa, December, 1924.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STUDY OF M. BEYLE\r\n\r\nBy Honor\xc3\xa9 De Balzac\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our day, literature quite evidently presents three aspects; and, so\r\nfar from being a symptom of decadence, this triplicity, to use an\r\nexpression coined by M. Cousin in his dislike of the word trinity, seems\r\nto me a natural enough effect of the abundance of literary talent: it is\r\na tribute to the nineteenth century, which does not offer one sole and\r\ninvariable form, like the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, which\r\nwere more or less obedient to the tyranny of a man or of a system.\r\n\r\nThese three forms, aspects or systems, by whichever name you choose to\r\ncall them, exist in nature and correspond to general sympathies which\r\nwere bound to declare themselves at a time when literature has seen,\r\nthrough the spread of knowledge, the number of its appreciators increase\r\nand the practice of reading advance with unparalleled progress.\r\n\r\nIn all generations and among all peoples there are minds that are\r\nelegiac, meditative, contemplative, minds that attach themselves more\r\nespecially to the great imagery, the vast spectacles of nature, and\r\ntranspose these into themselves. Hence a whole school to which I should\r\ngive the name: the _Literature of Imagery_, to which belong lyrical\r\nwriting, the epic and everything that springs from that way of looking\r\nat things.\r\n\r\nThere are, on the other hand, other active souls who like rapidity,\r\nmovement, conciseness, sudden shocks, action, drama, who avoid\r\ndiscussion, who have little fondness for meditation, and take pleasure\r\nin results. From these, another whole system from which springs what I\r\nshould call, in contrast to the former system, the _Literature of\r\nIdeas_.\r\n\r\nFinally, certain complete beings, certain _bifrontal_ intelligences\r\nembrace everything, choose both lyricism and action, drama and ode, in\r\nthe belief that perfection requires a view of things as a whole. This\r\nschool, which may be called _Literary Eclecticism_, demands a\r\nrepresentation of the world as it is: imagery and ideas, the idea in the\r\nimage or the image in the idea, movement and meditation. Walter Scott\r\nhas entirely satisfied these eclectic natures.\r\n\r\nWhich party predominates, I do not know. I should not like anyone to\r\ninfer from this natural distinction forced consequences. Thus, I do not\r\nmean to say that such and such a poet of the school of imagery is devoid\r\nof ideas, or that some other poet of the school of ideas cannot invent\r\nfine images. These three formulas apply only to the general impression\r\nleft by the poets\' work, to the mould into which the writer casts his\r\nthought, to the natural tendency of his mind. Every image corresponds to\r\nan idea, or, more precisely, to a _sentiment_ which is a collection of\r\nideas, and the idea does not always end in an image. The idea demands an\r\neffort in its development which does not come readily to every mind.\r\nAlso the image is essentially popular, it is readily understood. Suppose\r\nthat M. Hugo\'s _Notre-Dame de Paris_ were to appear simultaneously with\r\n_Manon Lescaut_, _Notre-Dame_ would seize hold of the masses far more\r\npromptly than Manon, and would seem to have outrivalled it in the eyes\r\nof those who kneel before the _Vox populi_.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, whatever be the kind from which a work proceeds, it will dwell\r\nin the human memory only by obeying the laws of the ideal and those of\r\nform. In literature, imagery and idea correspond nearly enough to what\r\nin painting we call design and colour. Rubens and Raphael are two great\r\npainters; but he would be strangely mistaken who thought that Raphael\r\nwas not a colourist; and those who would refuse to Rubens the title of\r\ndraughtsman may go and kneel before the painting with which the\r\nillustrious Fleming has adorned the Church of the Jesuits at Genoa, as\r\nan act of homage to design.\r\n\r\nM. Beyle, better known by the pseudonym Stendhal, is, in my opinion, one\r\nof the most eminent masters of the _Literature of Ideas_, a school to\r\nwhich belong MM. Alfred de Musset, M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e, L\xc3\xa9on Gozlan, B\xc3\xa9ranger,\r\nDelavigne, Gustave Planche, Madame de Girardin, Alphonse Karr and\r\nCharles Nodier. Henry Monnier belongs to it by the truth of his\r\nproverbs, which are often lacking in a root-idea, but which are\r\nnevertheless full of that naturalness and that accurate observation\r\nwhich are characteristic of the school.\r\n\r\nThis school, to which we already owe much fine work, recommends itself\r\nby its abundance of facts, by the sobriety of its imagery, by\r\nconciseness, by clarity, by the _petite phrase_ of Voltaire, by a way of\r\nrelating a story which the eighteenth century possessed, and, above all,\r\nby a sense of comedy. M. Beyle and M. M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e, despite their profound\r\nseriousness, have something ironical and sly in the manner in which they\r\nstate their facts. With them the comedy is kept in reserve. It is the\r\nspark in the flint.\r\n\r\nM. Victor Hugo\'s is undoubtedly the most eminent talent in the\r\n_Literature of Imagery_. M. Lamartine belongs to this school, which M.\r\nde Chateaubriand held over the baptismal font, and the philosophy of\r\nwhich was created by M. Ballanche. _Obermann_ is another. MM. Auguste\r\nBarbier, Th\xc3\xa9ophile Gautier, Sainte-Beuve are others, as are a number of\r\nfeeble imitators. In some of the authors whom I have just named, the\r\nsentiment prevails sometimes over the image, as in M. de S\xc3\xa9nancour and\r\nM. Sainte-Beuve. By his poetry rather than by his prose, M. de Vigny is\r\nseen to belong to this great school. All these poets have little sense\r\nof comedy, they know nothing of dialogue, with the exception of M.\r\nGautier, who has a keen sense of it. M. Hugo\'s dialogue is too much his\r\nown speech, he does not transform himself sufficiently, he puts himself\r\ninto his character, instead of becoming that character. But this school\r\nhas, like the other, produced some fine work. It is remarkable for the\r\npoetic fulness of its language, for the wealth of its imagery, for the\r\ncloseness of its union with nature; the other school is human, and this\r\none divine in the sense that it tends to raise itself by feeling towards\r\nthe very heart of creation. It prefers nature to man. The French\r\nlanguage is indebted to it for a strong dose of poetry which was\r\nnecessary, for it has developed the poetic feeling long resisted by the\r\n_positivism_--pardon the word--of our language, and the dryness stamped\r\non it by the writers of the eighteenth century. Jean-Jacques Rousseau,\r\nBernardin de Saint-Pierre were the instigators of this revolution, which\r\nI regard as fortunate.\r\n\r\nThe secret of the struggle between the Classics and the Romantics lies\r\nentirely in this quite natural disparity of minds. For two centuries\r\npast, the _Literature of Ideas_ has held exclusive sway, and so the\r\nheirs of the eighteenth century naturally mistook the only system of\r\nliterature that they knew for the whole of literature. Let us not blame\r\nthem, these defenders of the classic! The Literature of Ideas, full of\r\nfacts, closely knit, is part of the genius of France. The _Profession de\r\nfoi du vicaire savoyard_, _Candide_, the _Dialogue de Sylla et\r\nd\'Eucrate_, the _Consid\xc3\xa9rations sur les causes de la Grandeur et de la\r\nD\xc3\xa9cadence des Romains_, the _Provinciales_, _Manon Lescaut_, _Gil\r\nBlas_, are more in the French spirit than the works of the Literature of\r\nImagery. But we owe to this latter the poetry of which the two previous\r\ncenturies had not even a suspicion, if we set aside La Fontaine, Andr\xc3\xa9\r\nCh\xc3\xa9nier and Racine. The Literature of Imagery is in its cradle, and\r\nalready includes a number of men whose genius is incontestable; but,\r\nwhen I see how many the other school includes, I believe it to be at the\r\nheight rather than in the decline of its dominance over our beautiful\r\ntongue. The struggle ended, one may say that the Romantics have not\r\ninvented new methods, that in the theatre, for instance, those who\r\ncomplain of want of action have made ample use of the _tirade_ and the\r\nsoliloquy, and that we have not, so far, either heard the keen and\r\ncompact dialogue of Beaumarchais, nor seen again the comedy of Moli\xc3\xa8re,\r\nwhich will always be based upon reason and ideas. Comedy is the enemy of\r\nmeditation and imagery. M. Hugo has gained enormously in this contest.\r\nBut men of wide reading remember the war waged on M. de Chateaubriand,\r\nduring the Empire; it was fully as savage, and ended sooner because M.\r\nde Chateaubriand stood alone, without the _stipante caterva_ of M. Hugo,\r\nwithout the antagonism of the press, without the support furnished to\r\nthe Romantics by the men of genius of England and Germany, better known\r\nand better appreciated.\r\n\r\nAs for the third school, which partakes of each of the other two, it has\r\nless chance than they of exciting the masses, who have little taste for\r\nthe _mezzo termine_, for composite things, and see in eclecticism an\r\narrangement that runs counter to their passions in so far as it calms\r\nthem. France likes to find war in everything. In time of peace, she is\r\nstill fighting. Nevertheless, Walter Scott, Madame de Sta\xc3\xabl, Cooper,\r\nGeorge Sand seem to me to have distinct genius. As for myself, I take my\r\nstand under the banner of literary eclecticism for the following reason:\r\nI do not believe the portrayal of modern society to be possible by the\r\nsevere method of the literature of the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies. The introduction of the dramatic element, of the image, the\r\npicture, of description, of dialogue, seems to me indispensable in\r\nmodern literature. Let us confess frankly that _Gil Blas_ is wearisome\r\nas form: in the piling up of events and ideas there is something\r\nsterile. The idea, personified in a character, shews a finer\r\nintelligence. Plato cast his psychological ethics in the form of\r\ndialogue.\r\n\r\n_La Chartreuse de Parme_ is of our period and, up to the present, to my\r\nmind, is the masterpiece of the Literature of Ideas, while M. Beyle has\r\nmade concessions in it to the two other schools, which are admissible by\r\nfair minds and satisfactory to both camps.\r\n\r\nIf I have so long delayed, in spite of its importance, in speaking of\r\nthis book, you must understand that it was difficult for me to acquire a\r\nsort of impartiality. Even now I am not certain that I can retain it, so\r\nextraordinary, after a third, leisurely and thoughtful reading, do I\r\nfind this work.\r\n\r\nI can imagine all the mockery which my admiration for it will provoke.\r\nThere will be an outcry, of course, at my infatuation, when I am simply\r\nstill filled with enthusiasm after the point at which enthusiasm should\r\nhave died. Men of imagination, it will be said, conceive as promptly as\r\nthey forget their affection for certain works of which the common herd\r\narrogantly and ironically protest that they can understand nothing.\r\nSimple-minded, or even intelligent persons who with their proud gaze\r\nsweep the surface of things, will say that I amuse myself with paradox,\r\nthat I have, like M. Sainte-Beuve, my _chers inconnus_. I am incapable\r\nof compromise with the truth, that is all.\r\n\r\nM. Beyle has written a book in which sublimity glows from chapter after\r\nchapter. He has produced, at an age when men rarely find monumental\r\nsubjects and after having written a score of extremely intelligent\r\nvolumes, a work which can be appreciated only by minds and men that are\r\ntruly superior. In short, he has written _The Prince up to date_, the\r\nnovel that Machiavelli would write if he were living banished from Italy\r\nin the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nAnd so the chief obstacle to the renown which M. Beyle deserves lies in\r\nthe fact that _La Chartreuse de Parme_ can find readers fitted to enjoy\r\nit only among diplomats, ministers, observers, the leaders of society,\r\nthe most distinguished artists; in a word, among the twelve or fifteen\r\nhundred persons who are at the head of things in Europe. Do not be\r\nsurprised, therefore, if, in the ten months since this surprising work\r\nwas published, there has not been a single journalist who has either\r\nread, or understood, or studied it, who has announced, analysed and\r\npraised it, who has even alluded to it. I, who, I think, have some\r\nunderstanding of the matter, I have read it for the third time in the\r\nlast few days: I have found the book finer even than before, and have\r\nfelt in my heart the kind of happiness that comes from the opportunity\r\nof doing a good action.\r\n\r\nIs it not doing a good action to try to do justice to a man of immense\r\ntalent, who will appear to have genius only in the eyes of a few\r\nprivileged beings and whom the transcendency of his ideas deprives of\r\nthat immediate but fleeting popularity which the courtiers of the public\r\nseek and which great souls despise? If the mediocre knew that they had a\r\nchance of raising themselves to the level of the sublime by\r\nunderstanding them, _La Chartreuse de Parme_ would have as many readers\r\nas _Clarissa Harlowe_ had on its first appearance.\r\n\r\nThere are in admiration that is made legitimate by conscience ineffable\r\ndelights. Therefore all that I am going to say here I address to the\r\npure and noble hearts which, in spite of certain pessimistic\r\ndeclamations, exist in every country, like undiscovered pleiads, among\r\nthe families of minds devoted to the worship of art. Has not humanity,\r\nfrom generation to generation, has it not here below its constellations\r\nof souls, its heaven, its angels, to use the favourite expression of the\r\ngreat Swedish prophet, Swedenborg, a chosen people for whom true artists\r\nwork and whose judgments make them ready to accept privation, the\r\ninsolence of upstarts and the indifference of governments?\r\n\r\nYou will pardon me, I hope, what malevolent persons will call\r\n_longueurs_. In the first place, I am firmly convinced, the analysis of\r\nso curious and so interesting a work as this will give more pleasure to\r\nthe most fastidious reader than he would derive from the unpublished\r\nnovel whose place it fills. Besides, any other critic would require at\r\nleast three articles of the length of this, if he sought to give an\r\nadequate explanation of this novel, which often contains a whole book in\r\na single page, and which cannot be explained save by a man to whom the\r\nNorth of Italy is fairly familiar. Finally, let me assure you that, with\r\nthe help of M. Beyle, I am going to try to make myself instructive\r\nenough to be read with pleasure to the end.\r\n\r\nA sister of the Marchese del Dongo, named Gina, the abbreviation of\r\nAngelina, whose early character, as a young girl, would have a certain\r\nsimilarity, could an Italian woman ever resemble a Frenchwoman, to the\r\ncharacter of Madame de Lignolle in _Faublas_, marries at Milan, against\r\nthe will of her brother, who wishes to marry her to an old man, noble,\r\nrich and Milanese, a certain Conte Pietranera, poor and without a penny.\r\n\r\nThe Conte and Contessa support the French party, and are the ornament of\r\nthe Court of Prince Eug\xc3\xa8ne. We are in the days of the Kingdom of Italy,\r\nwhen the story begins.\r\n\r\nThe Marchese del Dongo, a Milanese attached to Austria and her spy,\r\nspends fourteen years waiting for the fall of the Emperor Napoleon.\r\nMoreover, this Marchese, the brother of Gina Pietranera, does not live\r\nat Milan: he occupies his castle of Grianta, on the Lake of Como: he\r\nthere brings up his elder son in the love of Austria and on sound\r\nprinciples; but he has a younger son, named Fabrizio, to whom Signora\r\nPietranera is passionately devoted: Fabrizio is a cadet of the family;\r\nlike her, he will be left without a penny in the world. Who is not\r\nfamiliar with the fondness of noble hearts for the disinherited? Also,\r\nshe wishes to make something of him. Then, fortunately, Fabrizio is a\r\ncharming boy; she obtains leave to put him to school at Milan, where,\r\nplaying truant, she makes him see something of the viceregal court.\r\n\r\nNapoleon falls for the first time. While he is on the Island of Elba, in\r\nthe course of the reaction at Milan, which the Austrians have\r\nreoccupied, an insult offered to the Armies of Italy in the presence of\r\nPietranera, who takes it up, is the cause of his death: he is killed in\r\na duel.\r\n\r\nA lover of the Contessa refuses to avenge her husband, Gina humiliates\r\nhim by one of those acts of vengeance, magnificent south of the Alps,\r\nwhich would be thought stupid in Paris. This is her revenge:\r\n\r\nAlthough she despises, in _petto_, this lover who has been adoring her\r\nat a distance and without reward for the last six years, she pays\r\ncertain attentions to the wretch, and, when he is in a paroxysm of\r\nsuspense, writes to him:\r\n\r\n\r\n"Will you act for once like a man of spirit? Please to imagine that you\r\nhave never known me. I am, with a touch of contempt, your servant,\r\n\r\nGINA PIETRANERA."\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, to increase still further the desperation of this rich man, with\r\nhis income of two hundred thousand lire, she _ginginates_ (_ginginare_\r\nis a Milanese verb meaning everything that passes at a distance between\r\na pair of lovers before they have spoken; the verb has its noun: one is\r\na _gingino_. It is the first stage in love). Well, she ginginates for a\r\nmoment with a fool whom she soon abandons; then she retires, with a\r\npension of fifteen hundred francs, to a third floor apartment where all\r\nMilan of the day comes to see her and admires her.\r\n\r\nHer brother, the Marchese, invites her to return to the ancestral castle\r\non the Lake of Como. She goes there, to see once more and to protect her\r\ncharming nephew, Fabrizio, to comfort her sister-in-law and to plan her\r\nown future amid the sublime scenery of the Lake of Como, her native soil\r\nand the native soil of this nephew whom she has made her son: she has no\r\nchildren. Fabrizio, who loves Napoleon, learns of his landing from the\r\nGulf of Juan and wishes to go to serve the sovereign of his uncle\r\nPietranera. His mother, who, the wife of a rich Marchese with an income\r\nof five hundred thousand lire, has not a penny to call her own, his aunt\r\nGina, who has nothing, give him their diamonds: Fabrizio is in their\r\neyes a hero.\r\n\r\nThe inspired volunteer crosses Switzerland, arrives in Paris, takes part\r\nin the battle of Waterloo, then returns to Italy, where, for having\r\ndabbled in the conspiracy of 1815 against the peace of Europe, he is\r\ndisowned by his father and the Austrian government place him on their\r\nindex. For him, to return to Milan would be to enter the Spielberg. From\r\nthis point Fabrizio, in trouble, persecuted for his heroism, this\r\nsublime boy becomes everything in the world to Gina.\r\n\r\nThe Contessa returns to Milan, she obtains a promise from Bubna and from\r\nthe men of character whom Austria at this period has put in authority\r\nthere, not to persecute Fabrizio, whom, following the advice of an\r\nextremely shrewd Canon, she keeps in concealment at Novara. Meanwhile,\r\nwith all these things happening, no money. But Gina is of a sublime\r\nbeauty, she is the type of that Lombard beauty (_bellezza folgorante_)\r\nwhich can be realised only at Milan and in the Scala when you see\r\nassembled there the thousand beautiful women of Lombardy. The events of\r\nthis troubled life have developed in her the most magnificent Italian\r\ncharacter: she has intellect, shrewdness, the Italian grace, the most\r\ncharming conversation, an astonishing command of herself; in short, the\r\nContessa is at one and the same time Madame de Montespan, Catherine de\'\r\nMedici, Catherine II, too, if you like: the most audacious political\r\ngenius and the most consummate feminine genius, hidden beneath a\r\nmarvellous beauty. Having watched over her nephew, despite the hatred of\r\nthe elder brother who is jealous of him, despite the hatred and\r\nindifference of the father, having snatched him from these perils,\r\nhaving been one of the queens of the court of the Viceroy Eug\xc3\xa8ne, and\r\nthen nothing; all these crises have enriched her natural forces,\r\nexercised her faculties and awakened the instincts numbed in the depths\r\nof her being by her early prosperity, by a marriage the joys of which\r\nhave been rare, owing to the continual absence of Napoleon\'s devoted\r\nservant. Everyone sees or can divine in her the thousand treasures of\r\npassion, the resources and the refulgence of the most perfect feminine\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nThe old Canon, whom she has seduced, sends Fabrizio to Novara, a small\r\ntown in Piedmont, under the tutelage of a parish priest. This priest\r\nputs a step to the inquiries of the police by his description of\r\nFabrizio: "a younger son who feels wronged because he is not the\r\neldest." When Gina, who had dreamed of Fabrizio\'s becoming aide-de-camp\r\nto Napoleon, sees Napoleon banished to St. Helena, she realises that\r\nFabrizio, his name inscribed in the black book of the Milanese police,\r\nis lost to her for ever.\r\n\r\nDuring the uncertainties which prevailed throughout Europe at the time\r\nof the battle of Waterloo, Gina has made the acquaintance of Conte Mosca\r\ndella Rovere, the Minister of the famous Prince of Parma,\r\nRanuccio-Ernesto IV.\r\n\r\nLet us pause at this point.\r\n\r\nCertainly, after having read the book, it is impossible not to\r\nrecognise, in Conte Mosca, the most remarkable portrait that anyone\r\ncould ever make of Prince Metternich, but of a Metternich transported\r\nfrom the great Chancellory of the Austrian Empire to the modest State of\r\nParma. The State of Parma and Ernesto IV seem to me similarly to be the\r\nDuke of Modena and his Duchy. M. Beyle says of Ernesto IV that he is one\r\nof the richest Princes in Europe: the wealth of the Duke of Modena is\r\nfamous. In seeking to avoid personalities the author has expended more\r\ningenuity than Walter Scott required to construct the plot of\r\nKenilworth. Indeed, these two similarities are vague enough, outwardly,\r\nto be denied, and so real inwardly that the well-informed reader cannot\r\nbe mistaken. M. Beyle has so exalted the sublime character of the Prime\r\nMinister of the State of Parma that it is doubtful whether Prince\r\nMetternich be so great a man as Mosca, although the heart of that\r\ncelebrated statesman does offer, to those who know his life well, one or\r\ntwo examples of passions of a compass at least equal to that of Mosca\'s.\r\nIt is not slandering the Austrian Minister to believe him capable of all\r\nthe secret greatnesses of Mosca. As for what Mosca is throughout the\r\nbook, as for the conduct of the man whom Gina regards as the greatest\r\ndiplomat in Italy, it took genius to create the incidents, the events\r\nand the innumerable and recurring plots in the midst of which this\r\nimmense character unfolds. All that M. de Metternich has done during his\r\nlong career is not more extraordinary than what you see done by Mosca.\r\nWhen one comes to think that the author has invented it all, ravelled\r\nall the plot and then unravelled it, as things do ravel and unravel\r\nthemselves at a court, the most daring mind, a mind to which the\r\nconception of ideas is a familiar process, is left dazed, stupefied\r\nbefore so huge a task. As for myself, I suspect some literary\r\nAladdin\'s-lamp. To have dared to put on the stage a man of the genius\r\nand force of M. de Choiseul, Potemkin, M. de Metternich, to create him,\r\nto justify the creation by the actions of the creature himself, to make\r\nhim move in an environment which is appropriate to him and in which his\r\nfaculties have full play, is the work not of a man but of a fairy, a\r\nwizard. Bear in mind that the most skilfully complicated plots of Walter\r\nScott do not arrive at the admirable simplicity which prevails in the\r\nrecital of these events, so numerous, so _thickly foliaged_, to borrow\r\nthe famous expression of Diderot.\r\n\r\nHere is the portrait of Mosca. We are in 1816, remember.\r\n\r\n"He might have been forty or forty-five: he had strongly marked\r\nfeatures, with no trace of self-importance, and a simple and\r\nlight-hearted manner which told in his favour; he would have looked very\r\nwell indeed, if a whim on the part of his Prince had not obliged him to\r\nwear powder on his hair as a proof of his soundness in politics."\r\n\r\nAnd so the powder which M. de Metternich wears, and which softens a face\r\nalready so gentle, is justified in Mosca by the will of his master. In\r\nspite of the prodigious efforts of M. Beyle, who, on page after page,\r\nnaturalises in this State marvellous inventions to deceive his reader\r\nand blunt the point of his allusions, the mind is at Modena and will on\r\nno account consent to remain at Parma. Whoever has seen, known, met M.\r\nde Metternich, thinks that he hears him speaking through the mouth of\r\nMosca, lends Mosca his voice and clothes him in his manners. Although,\r\nin the book, Ernesto IV dies, and the Duke of Modena is still living,\r\none is often reminded of that Prince _so notorious for his severities_,\r\n_which the Liberals of Milan called cruelties_. Such are the expressions\r\nused by the author in speaking of the Prince of Parma.\r\n\r\nIn these two portraits, begun with a satirical intention, there is,\r\nhowever, nothing that can wound, nothing that reeks of vengeance.\r\nAlthough M. Beyle has no cause to thank M. de Metternich, who refused\r\nhim his _exequatur_ for the Trieste Consulate, and although the Duke of\r\nModena has never been able to look with pleasure on the author of _Rome,\r\nNaples et Florence_, of the _Promenades en Rome_, and of certain other\r\nworks, these two figures are portrayed with great taste and the utmost\r\npropriety.\r\n\r\nThis is what, no doubt, occurred during the actual work of these two\r\ncreations. Carried away by the enthusiasm necessary to him who handles\r\nclay and scalpel, the brush and colours, the pen and the treasures of\r\nman\'s moral nature, M. Beyle, who had started out to depict a little\r\ncourt in Italy and a diplomat, ended with the type PRINCE and the type\r\nPRIME MINISTER. The resemblance, began with the fantasy of a satirical\r\nmind, ceased where the genius of the arts appeared to the artist.\r\n\r\nThis convention of masks once admitted, the reader, keenly interested,\r\naccepts the admirable Italian scene which the author paints, the town\r\nand all the buildings necessary to his story, which, in many places, has\r\nthe magical quality of an Oriental tale.\r\n\r\nThis long parenthesis was indispensable. Let us continue.\r\n\r\nMosca is smitten with love, but with a love immense, eternal, boundless,\r\nfor Gina, absolutely like M. de Metternich and his Leykam. He lets her,\r\nat the risk of compromising himself, have the latest diplomatic news\r\nbefore anyone else. The presence at Milan of this Minister of the State\r\nof Parma is perfectly accounted for later on.\r\n\r\nTo give you an idea of this famous Italian love, I must relate to you a\r\ndistinctly curious incident. On their departure, in 1799, the Austrians\r\nsaw as they left Milan, on the Bastion, a certain Contessa B----nini who\r\nwas driving with a Canon, both heedless of revolutions and war: they\r\nwere in love. The Bastion is a magnificent avenue which starts from the\r\nEastern Gate (Porta Renza) and corresponds to the Champs-Elys\xc3\xa9es in\r\nParis, with this slight difference that on the left extends the Duomo,\r\n"that mountain of gold transmuted into marble," as Francis II, who had a\r\ngift of expression, called it; and on the right the snowy fringe, the\r\nsublime chasms of the Alps. On their return in 1814 the first thing the\r\nAustrians saw was the Contessa and the Canon, sitting in the same\r\ncarriage and saying, perhaps, the same things, at the same point on the\r\nBastion. I have seen, in that city, a young man who became ill if he\r\nwent more than a certain number of streets away from the house of his\r\nmistress. When a woman gives an Italian sensations, he never leaves her.\r\n\r\n"In spite of his frivolous air and his polished manners. Mosca," says M.\r\nBeyle, "was not blessed with a soul of the French type; he could not\r\n_forget_ the things that annoyed him. When there was a thorn in his\r\npillow, he would blunt it by repeated stabbings of his throbbing limbs."\r\nThis superior man guesses the superior mind of the Contessa, he falls in\r\nlove with her to the point of behaving like a schoolboy.\r\n\r\n"After all," the Minister said to himself, "old age is only being\r\nincapable of indulging in these delicious timidities."\r\n\r\nThe Contessa one evening remarks the fine, benevolent gaze of Mosca.\r\n(The gaze with which M. de Metternich would deceive the Deity.)\r\n\r\n"At Parma," she says to him, "if you were to look like that, you would\r\ngive them the hope that they might escape hanging."\r\n\r\nIn the end the diplomat, having realised how essential this woman is to\r\nhis happiness, and after three months of inward struggle, arrives with\r\nthree different plans, devised to secure his happiness, and makes her\r\nagree to the wisest of them.\r\n\r\nIn Mosca\'s eyes, Fabrizio is a child: the excessive interest which the\r\nContessa takes in her nephew seems to him one of those elective\r\nmaternities which, until love comes to reign there, beguile the hearts\r\nof noble-hearted women.\r\n\r\nMosca, unfortunately, is married. Accordingly he brings to Milan the\r\nDuca Sanseverina-Taxis. Let me, in this analysis, introduce a few\r\nquotations which will give you examples of the vivid, free, sometimes\r\nfaulty style of M. Beyle, and will enable me to make myself be read with\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nThe Duca is a handsome little old man of sixty-eight, dapple-grey, very\r\npolished, very neat, immensely rich, but not quite as noble as he ought\r\nto have been. Apart from this, the Duca is by no means an absolute\r\nidiot, says the Conte: "he gets his clothes and wigs from Paris. He is\r\nnot the sort of man who would do anything _deliberately_ mean, he\r\nseriously believes that honour consists in having a Grand Cordon, and he\r\nis ashamed of his riches. He wants an Embassy. Marry him, he will give\r\nyou a hundred thousand scudi, a magnificent jointure, his _palazzo_ and\r\nthe most superb existence in Parma. On these conditions, I make the\r\nPrince appoint him Ambassador, he will have his Grand Cordon, and he\r\nwill start the day after his marriage; you become Duchessa Sanseverina,\r\nand we live happily. Everything is settled with the Duca, who will be\r\nmade the happiest man in the world by our arrangement: he will never\r\nshew his face again in Parma. If this life does not appeal to you, I\r\nhave four hundred thousand francs, I hand in my resignation and we go\r\nand live at Naples."\r\n\r\n"Do you know that what you and your Duca are proposing is highly\r\nimmoral?" says the Contessa.\r\n\r\n"No more immoral than what is done at every court," the Minister\r\nanswers. "Absolute Power has this advantage, that it justifies\r\neverything. Every year we shall be afraid of a 1798, and everything that\r\ncan reduce that fear will be supremely moral. You shall hear the\r\nspeeches I make on the subject at my receptions. The Prince has\r\nconsented, and you will have a brother in the Duca, who has not dared to\r\nhope for such a marriage, which saves his face; he thinks himself ruined\r\nbecause he lent twenty-five napoleons to the great Ferrante Palla, a\r\nRepublican, a poet and something of a genius, whom we have sentenced to\r\ndeath, fortunately in his absence."\r\n\r\nGina accepts. We next see her Duchessa Sanseverina-Taxis, astonishing\r\nthe court of Parma by her affability, by the noble serenity of her mind.\r\nHer house is the most attractive in the town, she reigns there, she is\r\nthe glory of this little court.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of Ernesto IV, his reception of the Duchessa, her\r\nintroduction to each member in turn of the Reigning House, all these\r\ndetails are marvels of wit, depth, succinctness. Never have the hearts\r\nof Princes, Ministers, courtiers and women been so depicted. The reader\r\nwill find it hard to lay the book down.\r\n\r\nWhen the Duchessa\'s nephew fled from Austrian persecution and was on his\r\nway from the Lake of Como to Novara under the protection of his\r\nconfessor and the parish priest, he met Fabio Conti, General of the\r\nArmies of the State of Parma, one of the most curious figures of this\r\ncourt and of the book, a general who thinks of nothing but whether His\r\nHighness\'s soldiers ought to have seven buttons on their uniform or\r\nnine; but this comic general possesses an entrancing daughter, Clelia\r\nConti. Fabrizio and Clelia, both trying to escape from the police, have\r\nexchanged a few words. Clelia is the most beautiful creature in Parma.\r\nAs soon as the Prince sees the effect produced in his court by the\r\nSanseverina, he thinks of counter-balancing that beauty by bringing\r\nClelia to light. A great difficulty! Girls are not received at court: he\r\ntherefore has her created a Canoness.\r\n\r\nThe Prince has of course a mistress. One of his weaknesses is to ape\r\nLouis XIV. So, to be in the picture, he has provided himself with a La\r\nValli\xc3\xa8re, one Contessa Balbi, who dips her fingers into every\r\nmoney-bag, and is not forgotten when any government contract is made.\r\nErnesto IV would be in despair if the Balbi were not slightly grasping:\r\nthe scandalous fortune of his mistress is a sign of royal power. He is\r\nlucky, the Contessa is a miser!\r\n\r\n"She received me," the Duchessa tells Mosca, "as though she expected me\r\nto give her a _buona mancia_ (a tip)."\r\n\r\nBut, to the great grief of Ernesto IV, the Contessa, who has no brains,\r\ncannot be compared for a moment to the Duchessa; this humiliates him, a\r\nfirst source of irritation. His mistress is thirty, and a model of\r\nItalian _leggiadria_.\r\n\r\nShe had still the finest eyes in the world and the most graceful little\r\nhands;[1] but her skin was netted with countless fine little wrinkles\r\nwhich made her look like a young grandmother. As she was obliged to\r\nsmile at everything the Prince said, and sought to make him think, by\r\nthis ironical smile, that she understood him, Conte Mosca used to say\r\nthat these suppressed yawns had in course of time produced her wrinkles.\r\n\r\nThe Duchessa parries the first blow aimed at her by His Highness by\r\nmaking a friend of Clelia, who, fortunately, is an innocent creature.\r\nFrom motives of policy, the Prince allows to exist at Parma a sort of\r\nParty, called Liberal (God knows what sort of Liberals!). A Liberal is a\r\nman who has the great men of Italy, Dante, Machiavelli, Petrarch, Leo X\r\npainted welcoming Monti on a ceiling. This passes as an epigram against\r\nthe power which has no longer any great men. This Liberal Party has as\r\nits chief a Marchesa Raversi, an ugly and mischievous woman, as\r\nirritating as an Opposition. Fabio Conti, the General, belongs to this\r\nParty. The Prince, who hangs agitators, has his reasons for allowing a\r\nLiberal Party.\r\n\r\nErnesto IV rejoices in a Laubardemont, his Fiscal General or Chief\r\nJustice, named Rassi. This Rassi, full of natural intelligence, is one\r\nof the most horribly comic or comically horrible personages that can be\r\nimagined: he laughs and has people hanged, he makes a game of his\r\njustice. He is necessary, indispensable to the Prince. Rassi is a blend\r\nof Fouch\xc3\xa9, Fouquier-Tinville, Merlin, Triboulet and Scapin. You call\r\nthe Prince a _tyrant_: he says that this is conspiracy and he hangs you.\r\nHe has already hanged two Liberals. Since this execution, notorious\r\nthroughout Italy, the Prince, who is brave when on the field of battle\r\nand has led armies, the Prince, though a man of spirit, lives in fear.\r\nThis Rassi becomes something terrible, he attains to gigantic\r\nproportions while still remaining grotesque: he embodies all the justice\r\nof this little State.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the inevitable effects at court of the Duchessa\'s triumphs.\r\nThe Conte and the Duchessa, that pair of eagles caged in this tiny\r\ncapital, soon begin to offend the Prince. In the first place the\r\nDuchessa is sincerely attached to the Conte, the Conte is more in love\r\nevery day, and this happiness irritates a bored Prince. Mosca\'s talents\r\nare indispensable to the Cabinet of Parma. Ranuccio-Ernesto and his\r\nMinister are attached to one another like the Siamese twins. Indeed,\r\nthey have between them contrived the impossible plan ("impossible" is a\r\nrhetorical precaution on M. Beyle\'s part) of making a single State of\r\nNorthern Italy. Beneath his mask of absolutism, the Prince is intriguing\r\nto become the Sovereign of this Constitutional Kingdom. He is dying of\r\nenvy to ape Louis XVIII, to give a Charter and Two Chamber government to\r\nNorthern Italy. He regards himself as a great politician, he has his\r\nambition: he redeems in his own eyes his subordinate position by this\r\nplan with which Mosca is fully acquainted; he has control of his\r\ntreasury! The more need he has of Mosca and the more he recognises his\r\nMinister\'s talent, the more reasons there are in the depths of this\r\nprincely heart for an unconfessed jealousy. Life at court is boring, at\r\nthe _palazzo_ Sanseverina it is amusing. What means remain to him of\r\ndemonstrating his power to himself? The chance of tormenting his\r\nMinister. And he torments him cruelly! The Prince tries first of all, in\r\na friendly way, to secure the Duchessa as his mistress, she refuses;\r\nthere are blows to self-esteem the elements of which may easily be\r\nguessed from this brief analysis. Presently, the Prince reaches the\r\nstage of wishing to attack his Minister through the Duchessa, and he\r\nthen seeks out ways of making her suffer.\r\n\r\nAll this part of the novel is of a remarkable literary solidity. This\r\npainting has the magnitude of a canvas fifty feet by thirty, and at the\r\nsame time the manner, the execution is Dutch in its minuteness. We come\r\nto the drama, and to a drama the most complete, the most gripping, the\r\nstrangest, the truest, the most profoundly explored in the human heart\r\nthat has ever been invented, but one that has existed, undoubtedly, at\r\nmany periods, and will reappear at courts where it will be enacted\r\nagain, as Louis XIII and Richelieu, as Francis II and Prince Metternich,\r\nas Louis XV, the du Barry and M. de Choiseul have enacted it in the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nThe prospect which, in this new setting, has most attracted the Duchessa\r\nis that of the possibility of making a career for her hero, for this\r\nchild of her heart, for Fabrizio her nephew. Fabrizio will owe his\r\nfortune to the genius of Mosca. The love which she has conceived for the\r\nchild she continues to feel for the youth. I may tell you now,\r\nbeforehand, that this love is to become later on, at first without\r\nGina\'s knowledge, then consciously, a passion that will reach the\r\nsublime. Nevertheless she will always be the wife of the great diplomat,\r\nto whom she will never have committed any other act of infidelity than\r\nthat of the passionate impulses of her heart towards this young idol;\r\nshe will not deceive this man of genius, she will always make him happy\r\nand proud; she will make him aware of her least emotions, he will endure\r\nthe most horrible rages of jealousy, and will never have any grounds for\r\ncomplaint. The Duchessa will be frank, artless, sublime, resigned,\r\nmoving as a play of Shakespeare, beautiful as poetry, and the most\r\nsevere reader will have no fault to find. I doubt if any poet has ever\r\nsolved such a problem with as much felicity as has M. Beyle in this bold\r\nwork. The Duchessa is one of those magnificent statues which make us at\r\nonce admire the art that created them and inveigh against Nature which\r\nis so sparing of such models. Gina, when you have read the book, will\r\nremain before your eyes like a sublime statue: it will be neither the\r\nVenus de Milo, nor the Venus de\' Medici; it will be Diana with the\r\nvoluptuousness of Venus, with the suavity of Raphael\'s Virgins, and the\r\nmovement of Italian passion. Above all, there is nothing French in the\r\nDuchessa. Yes, the Frenchman who has modelled, chiselled, wrought this\r\nmarble, has left nothing on it of his native soil. _Corinne_, you must\r\nrealise, is a miserable sketch compared with this living, ravishing\r\ncreature. You will find her great, intellectual, passionate, always true\r\nto life, and yet the author has carefully concealed her sensual aspect.\r\nThere is not in the work a single word that can make one think of the\r\npleasures of love or can inspire them. Although the Duchessa, Mosca,\r\nFabrizio, the Prince and his son, Clelia, although the book and its\r\ncharacters are, in their different ways, passion with all its furies;\r\nalthough it is Italy as it is, with its shrewdness, its dissimulation,\r\nits cunning, its coolness, its tenacity, its higher policy in every\r\nconnexion. _La Chartreuse de Parme_ is more chaste than the most\r\npuritanical of the novels of Walter Scott. To make a noble, majestic,\r\nalmost irreproachable character of a duchess who makes a Mosca happy,\r\nand keeps nothing from him, is not that a masterpiece of fiction? The\r\n_Ph\xc3\xa8dre_ of Racine, that sublime creation of the French stage, which\r\nJansenism did not venture to condemn, is not so beautiful, nor so\r\ncomplete, nor so animated.\r\n\r\nWell, at the moment when everything is smiling on the Duchessa, when she\r\nis amusing herself with this court life where a sudden storm is always\r\nto be feared, when she is most tenderly attached to the Conte, who,\r\nliterally, is mad with happiness; when he has the patent and receives\r\nthe honours of Prime Minister _which come very near to those paid to the\r\nSovereign himself_, she says to him one day:\r\n\r\n"And Fabrizio?"\r\n\r\nThe Conte then offers to obtain for her, from Austria, a pardon for this\r\ndear nephew.\r\n\r\n"But, if he is somewhat superior to the young men who ride their English\r\nthoroughbreds about the streets of Milan, what a life, at eighteen, to\r\nbe doing nothing with no prospect of ever having anything to do! If,"\r\nsays Mosca, "heaven had endowed him with a real passion, were it only\r\nfor angling, I should respect it; but what is he to do at Milan, even\r\nafter he has obtained his pardon?"\r\n\r\n"I should like him to be an officer," says the Duchessa.\r\n\r\n"Would you advise a Sovereign," says Mosca, "to entrust a post which, at\r\na given date, may be of some importance, to a young man who has shown\r\nenthusiasm, who, from Como, has gone to join Napoleon at Waterloo? A del\r\nDongo cannot be a merchant, nor a barrister, nor a doctor. You will cry\r\nout in protest, but you will come in the end to agree with me. If\r\nFabrizio wishes it, he can quickly become Archbishop of Parma, one of\r\nthe highest dignities in Italy, and from that Cardinal. We have had at\r\nParma three del Dongo Archbishops, the Cardinal who wrote a book in\r\nsixteen-something, Fabrizio in 1700 and Ascanio in 1750. Only, shall I\r\nremain Minister long enough? That is the sole objection."\r\n\r\nAfter two months spent in discussion, the Duchessa, defeated on every\r\npoint by the Conte\'s observations, and rendered desperate by the\r\nprecarious position of a younger son of a Milanese family, utters one\r\nday this profound Italian saying to her friend:\r\n\r\n"Prove to me again that every other career is impossible for Fabrizio."\r\n\r\nThe Conte proves it.\r\n\r\nThe Duchessa, susceptible to the thought of fame, sees no other way of\r\nsalvation, here below, for her dear Fabrizio, than the Church and its\r\nhigh dignities, for the future of Italy lies in Rome, and nowhere else.\r\nTo anyone who has studied Italy carefully, it is clear that the unity of\r\ngovernment in that country, that its nationality will never be\r\nre-established save by the hand of a Sixtus V. The Pope alone has the\r\npower to stir and to reconstitute Italy. And so we see with what pains\r\nthe Austrian court has watched, for the last thirty years, the elections\r\nof Popes, what aged imbeciles she has allowed to don the Triple Crown.\r\n"Perish Catholicism sooner than my domination!" seems to be her guiding\r\nmotto. Miserly Austria would spend a million to prevent the election of\r\na Pope with French ideas. And then, if some fine Italian genius employed\r\nsufficient dissimulation to put on the white cassock, he might die like\r\nGanganelli. There perhaps is to be found the secret of the refusals of\r\nthe Court of Rome, which has not chosen to accept the invigorating\r\npotion, the elixir offered to it by men of fine ecclesiastical genius\r\nfrom France: Borgia would not have failed to make them take their seat\r\namong his devoted Cardinals. The author of the Bull _In coena Domini_\r\nwould have understood the great Gallican idea, Catholic Democracy, he\r\nwould have adapted it to the circumstances. M. de Lamennais, that fallen\r\nangel, would not then, in his Breton obstinacy, have abandoned the\r\nCatholic, Apostolic and Roman Church.\r\n\r\nSo the Duchessa adopts this plan of the Conte. In this great woman there\r\nis, as in great politicians, a moment of uncertainty, of hesitation\r\nbefore a plan; but she never goes back upon her resolutions. The\r\nDuchessa is always right in wishing what she has wished. Her\r\npersistency, that strong quality of her imperious character, imparts an\r\nelement of terror to all the scenes of this fertile drama.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more clever than the initiation of Fabrizio into his\r\nfuture destiny. The lovers display to Fabrizio the chances of his life.\r\nFabrizio, a boy of astonishing intelligence, grasps everything at once\r\nand has a vision of the tiara. The Conte does not pretend to make a\r\npriest of him of the sort one sees everywhere in Italy. Fabrizio is a\r\ngreat gentleman, he can remain perfectly ignorant if it seems good to\r\nhim, and will none the less become Archbishop. Fabrizio refuses to lead\r\nthe life of the caff\xc3\xa8, he has a horror of poverty, and realises that he\r\ncannot be a soldier. When he speaks of going and becoming an American\r\ncitizen (we are in 1817), he has explained to him the dulness of life in\r\nAmerica, without smartness, without music, without love affairs, without\r\nwar, the cult of the god Dollar, and the respect due to artisans, to the\r\nmasses who by their votes decide everything. Fabrizio has a horror of\r\n_mobocracy_.\r\n\r\nAt the voice of the great diplomat, who shows him life as it really is,\r\nthe young man\'s illusions take flight. He had not understood what is\r\nincomprehensible to young people, the "_Surtout pas de z\xc3\xa8le_!" of M. de\r\nTalleyrand.\r\n\r\n"Remember," Mosca says to him, "that a proclamation, a caprice of the\r\nheart flings the enthusiast into the bosom of the party opposed to his\r\nown future sympathies."\r\n\r\nWhat a phrase![2]\r\n\r\nThe instructions given by the Minister to the neophyte who is to return\r\nto Parma only as a _Monsignore_, in violet stockings, and whom he sends\r\nto Naples to complete his studies with letters of recommendation to the\r\nArchbishop there, one of his clever friends; these instructions, given\r\nin the Duchessa\'s drawing-room, during a game of cards, are admirable. A\r\nsingle quotation will show you the fineness of the perceptions, the\r\nscience of life which the author gives to this great character.\r\n\r\n"Believe or not, as you choose, what they teach you, _but never raise\r\nany objection_. Imagine that they are teaching you the rules of the game\r\nof whist; would you raise any objection to the rules of whist? And once\r\nyou knew and had adopted those rules, would you not wish to win? Do not\r\nfall into the vulgar habit of speaking with horror of Voltaire, Diderot,\r\nRaynal and all those harebrained Frenchmen who have brought us that\r\nfoolish government by Two Chambers. Speak of them with a calm irony,\r\nthey are people who have long since been refuted. You will be forgiven a\r\nlittle amorous intrigue, if it is done in the proper way, but they would\r\ntake note of your objections: age stifles intrigue but encourages doubt.\r\nBelieve everything, do not yield to the temptation to shine; be morose:\r\ndiscerning eyes will see your cleverness in yours and it will be time\r\nenough to be witty when you are an Archbishop!"\r\n\r\nThe astonishing and fine superiority of Mosca is never lacking, either\r\nin action or in speech; it makes this book one as profound, from page to\r\npage, as the _Maxims_ of La Rochefoucauld. And observe that their\r\npassion leads the Conte and Duchessa to make mistakes, they are obliged\r\nto bring their talent into play to atone for them. To another man who\r\nhad consulted him, the Conte would have explained the misfortunes that\r\nwould await him at Parma after the death of Ernesto IV. But his passion\r\nhas made him completely blind to his own interests. Talent alone can\r\nmake you discover this poignant touch of comedy for yourself. Great\r\npoliticians are nothing more, after all, than equilibrists who, if they\r\ndo not take care, see their finest edifice come crashing to the ground.\r\nRichelieu was only saved from his peril, on the Day of the Dupes, by the\r\nbroth of the Queen Mother, who refused to go to Saint-Germain without\r\nhaving taken the _lait de poule_ which preserved her complexion. The\r\nDuchessa and Mosca live by a perpetual expenditure of all their\r\nfaculties; and so the reader who follows the spectacle of their life is\r\nkept in a trance, through chapter after chapter, so well are the\r\ndifficulties of this existence set before him, so cleverly are they\r\nexplained. Finally, let us note well, these crises, these terrible\r\nscenes are woven into the substance of the book: the flowers are not\r\nstitched on, they are of the same substance as the rest.\r\n\r\n"We must keep our love secret," the Duchessa says sadly to her lover, on\r\nthe day on which she has guessed that his struggle with the Prince has\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nWhen, to outact his acting, she lets Ernesto IV gather that she is only\r\nmoderately in love with the Conte, she gives him a day of happiness; but\r\nthe Prince is shrewd, he sees sooner or later that he has been tricked.\r\nAnd his disappointment adds violence to the storm brought about by her\r\nill-wishers.\r\n\r\nThis great work could not have been conceived or executed save by a man\r\nof fifty, in the full vigour of his age and in the maturity of all his\r\ntalents. One sees perfection in every detail. The character of the\r\nPrince is drawn by the hand of a master, and is, as I have told you,\r\n_The Prince_. One conceives him admirably, as a man and as sovereign.\r\nThis man might be at the head of the Russian Empire, he would be capable\r\nof ruling it, he would be great; but the man would remain what he is,\r\nliable to vanity, to jealousy, to passion. In the seventeenth-century,\r\nat Versailles, he would be Louis XIV and would avenge himself on the\r\nDuchessa, as did Louis XIV on Fouquet. Criticism can find no fault in\r\nthe greatest or in the smallest character; they are all what they ought\r\nto be. There is life and especially the life of courts, not drawn in\r\ncaricature, as Hoffmann has tried to draw it, but seriously and\r\nironically. Finally, this book explains to you admirably all that Louis\r\nXIII\'s _camarilla_ made Richelieu suffer. This work applied to vast\r\ninterests like those of the cabinet of Louis XIV, of Pitt\'s cabinet, of\r\nNapoleon\'s cabinet or of the Russian cabinet, would have been impossible\r\nowing to the prolixities and explanations which so many veiled interests\r\nwould have required; whereas you get a comprehensive view of the State\r\nof Parma; and Parma enables you to understand, _mutato nomine_, the\r\nintrigues of the most exalted court. Things were like this tinder the\r\nBorgia Pope, at the court of Tiberius, at the court of Philip II: they\r\nmust be like this also at the court of Peking!\r\n\r\nLet us enter into the terrible Italian drama which has been slowly and\r\nlogically preparing itself in a charming manner. I spare you the details\r\nof the court and its original figures; the Princess who thinks it her\r\nduty to be unhappy, because the Prince has his Pompadour; the Heir\r\nApparent who is kept caged; the Princess Isotta, the Chamberlain, the\r\nMinister of the Interior, the Governor of the Citadel, Fabio Conti. One\r\ncannot afford to take the least thing lightly. If, like the Duchessa,\r\nFabrizio and Mosca, you accept the court of Parma, you play your game of\r\nwhist and your interests are at stake. When the Prime Minister thinks\r\nthat he has fallen from power, he says quite seriously:\r\n\r\n"When our guests have gone, we can decide on a way of barricading\r\nourselves for the night; the best plan would be to set off while they\'re\r\ndancing for your place at Sacca, by the Po, from where in twenty minutes\r\none can get into Austria."\r\n\r\nIndeed the Duchessa, the Minister, every Parmesan subject is liable to\r\nend his days in the citadel.\r\n\r\nWhen the Prince confesses his desires to the Duchessa and she in reply\r\nasks him:\r\n\r\n"How should we ever lode Mosca in the face again, that man of genius and\r\nheart?"\r\n\r\n"I have thought of that," says the Prince: "we should never look him in\r\nthe face again! The citadel waits."\r\n\r\nThe Sanseverina does not fail to repeat this saying to Mosca, who puts\r\nhis affairs in order.\r\n\r\nFour years elapse.\r\n\r\nThe Minister, who has not allowed Fabrizio to come to Parma during these\r\nfour years, permits him to reappear there when the Pope has created him\r\nMonsignore, a kind of dignity which entitles him to wear violet\r\nstockings. Fabrizio has nobly answered the expectations of his political\r\nmaster. At Naples he has had mistresses, he has had the passion for\r\narcheology, he has sold his horses to make excavations, he has behaved\r\nwell, he has aroused no jealousy, he may become Pope. What delights him\r\nmost about his return to Parma is the thought of being delivered from\r\nthe attentions of the charming Duchessa d\'A----. His governor, who has\r\nmade him an educated man, receives a Cross and a pension. Fabrizio\'s\r\nfirst appearance at Parma, his arrival, his various presentations at\r\ncourt, form the highest comedy of manners, character and intrigue that\r\none can read anywhere. At more than one point, the better class of\r\nreader will lay down this book on his table to say to himself:\r\n\r\n"Heavens! How good this is, how exquisitely arranged, how deep!"\r\n\r\nHe will meditate upon words like the following, for instance, upon which\r\nPrinces ought to meditate well for their own good: _People with brains\r\nwho are born on the throne or at the foot of it soon lose all fineness\r\nof touch; they proscribe, in their immediate circle, freedom of\r\nconversation which seems to them coarseness, they refuse to look at\r\nanything but masks and pretend to judge the beauty of complexions; the\r\namusing part of it is that they imagine their touch to be of the\r\nfinest_.\r\n\r\nHere begin the Duchessa\'s ingenuous passion for Fabrizio, and Mosca\'s\r\ntorments. Fabrizio is a diamond that has lost nothing by being polished.\r\nGina, who had sent him to Naples a devil-may-care young rough-rider,\r\nwhose horsewhip seemed to be an inherent part of his person, sees him\r\nnow with a noble and confident bearing before strangers, and in private\r\nthe same fire of youth.\r\n\r\n"This nephew," Mosca tells his mistress, "is made to adorn all the\r\nexalted posts." But the great diplomat, attentive at first to Fabrizio,\r\nturns to look at the Duchessa and notices _a curious look in her eyes_.\r\n"I am in my fifties," he reflects.\r\n\r\nThe Duchessa is so happy that she does not give the Conte a thought.\r\nThis profound effect, made on Mosca by a single glance, is irremediable.\r\n\r\nWhen Ranuccio-Ernesto IV guesses that the aunt loves the nephew a little\r\nmore warmly than the laws of consanguinity permit, which at Parma is\r\nincest, he is at the pinnacle of happiness. He writes his Minister an\r\nanonymous letter on the subject. When he is sure that Mosca has read it,\r\nhe sends for him, without giving him time to call first on the Duchessa,\r\nand keeps him on the rack throughout a conversation full of princely\r\nfriendliness and hypocrisy. Certainly the pangs of love causing a fine\r\nheart to bleed always make an effective scene; but this heart is\r\nItalian, this is the heart of a man of genius, and I know nothing that\r\ngrips me so as the chapter on Mosca\'s jealousy.\r\n\r\nFabrizio does not love his aunt; he adores her as an aunt, she inspires\r\nno longing in him as a woman; nevertheless, in their Conversations, a\r\ngesture, a word may make youth break out, the least thing may then make\r\nhis aunt leave Parma, because riches, honours are nothing to her who,\r\nonce already, before the eyes of all Milan, has managed to live on a\r\nthird floor, with an income of fifteen hundred francs. The future\r\nArchbishop sees an abyss open before him. The Prince is as happy as a\r\nking, while waiting for a catastrophe to destroy the private happiness\r\nof his dear Minister. Mosca, the great Mosca, weeps like a child. The\r\nprudence of this dear Fabrizio, who understands Mosca and understands\r\nhis aunt, prevents any disaster. The Monsignore makes himself fall in\r\nlove with a little Marietta, an actress of the lowest grade, a columbine\r\nwho has her harlequin, a certain Giletti, formerly one of Napoleon\'s\r\ndragoons, and a fencing master, a man horrible in mind and body, who\r\ndevours Marietta, beats her, steals her blue shawls and all her\r\nearnings.\r\n\r\nMosca breathes again. The Prince is uneasy, his prey is escaping, he\r\ncould hold the Sanseverina by her nephew, and now the nephew turns out a\r\nprofound politician! In spite of Marietta, the Duchessa\'s passion is so\r\nartless, her familiarities are so dangerous, that Fabrizio, to restore\r\ntranquillity, proposes to the Conte, who also is an antiquarian and is\r\nengaged on excavations, to go down to the country and superintend the\r\nwork. The Minister adores Fabrizio. The company which includes Marietta,\r\nher _mammaccia_--a figure drawn in four pages with an astounding truth\r\nand depth of character--and Giletti, the whole motley crew, leave Parma.\r\nThis trio, Giletti, the _mammaccia_ and Marietta come along the road\r\nwhile Fabrizio is shooting. There follows an encounter between the\r\ndragoon, who seeks, in an access of Italian vanity, to kill the\r\n_black-frock_, and Fabrizio, who is amazed at seeing Marietta on the\r\nroad. This accidental duel becomes serious when Fabrizio sees that\r\nGiletti, who has only one eye, is trying to disfigure him: he kills him.\r\nGiletti was plainly the aggressor, the workmen engaged on the\r\nexcavations saw everything, Fabrizio realises all the capital that the\r\nRaversi faction and the Liberals will make out of this ridiculous\r\nadventure against himself, the Ministers, his aunt; he takes flight, he\r\ncrosses the Po. Thanks to the clever assistance of Lodovico, an old\r\nservant of the Sanseverina household, a fellow who writes sonnets, he\r\nfinds shelter and reaches Bologna, where he sees Marietta again.\r\nLodovico becomes fanatically attached to Fabrizio. This retired coachman\r\nis one of the most complete of the figures of the second magnitude.\r\nFabrizio\'s flight, the scenery by the Po, the descriptions of famous\r\nplaces through which the young prelate passes, his adventures during his\r\nexile from Parma, his correspondence with the Archbishop, another\r\ncharacter admirably drawn, the smallest details are of a literary\r\nexecution that bears the hall-mark of genius. And all is so Italian as\r\nto make one take the coach and fly to Italy, there to seek this drama\r\nand this poetry. The reader becomes Fabrizio.\r\n\r\nDuring this absence, Fabrizio goes to revisit his native scenes, the\r\nLake of Como and the paternal castle, despite the dangers of his\r\nposition with regard to Austria, at that time very strict. We are in\r\n1821, a time when a passport was not to be treated lightly. The prelate\r\nrecognised as Fabrizio del Dongo may be sent to the Spielberg. In this\r\npart of the book the author completes the portrait of a fine head, that\r\nof a Priore Blan\xc3\xa8s, a simple village curate, who adores Fabrizio and\r\ncultivates the study of judicial astrology. This portrait is done so\r\nseriously, there shines from it so great a faith in the occult sciences,\r\nthat the satire of which those sciences--to which we shall return and\r\nwhich do not rest, as has been supposed, upon false foundations--might\r\nnaturally be the object dies away on the lips of the incredulous. I do\r\nnot know what the author\'s opinion may be, but he justifies that of the\r\nPriore Blan\xc3\xa8s. Priore Blan\xc3\xa8s is a character who is true in Italy. The\r\ntruth of him can be felt, just as one can tell whether one of Titian\'s\r\nheads is the portrait of a Venetian gentleman or a fancy.\r\n\r\nThe Prince orders the preparation of the case against Fabrizio, and in\r\nthis task the genius of Rassi is revealed. The Fiscal General sends the\r\nwitnesses for the defence out of the country, purchases evidence for the\r\nprosecution, and, as he impudently informs the Prince, produces out of\r\nthis foolish affair--the death inflicted on a Giletti by a del Dongo, in\r\nself-defence, by a del Dongo who had received the first blow!--a\r\nsentence of detention for twenty years in the fortress. The Prince would\r\nhave liked a death sentence, in order to exercise clemency and so\r\nhumiliate the Sanseverina.\r\n\r\n"But," says Rassi, "I have done better than that, I have broken his\r\nneck, his career is barred to him for ever. The Vatican can do nothing\r\nmore for a murderer."\r\n\r\nSo the Prince holds the Sanseverina in his clutches at last! Ah! It is\r\nthen that the Duchessa becomes superb, that the court of Parma is\r\nagitated, that the lights go up on the drama, which assumes gigantic\r\nproportions. One of the finest scenes in modern fiction is, certainly,\r\nthat in which the Sanseverina comes to pay her farewell to the Sovereign\r\nand presents him with an ultimatum. The scene of Elizabeth, Amy and\r\nLeicester in _Kenilworth_ is no greater, more dramatic nor more\r\nterrible. The tiger is braved in his den: the serpent is caught, in vain\r\ndoes he writhe his coils and beg for pity, the woman crushes him. Gina\r\ndesires, dictates, obtains from the Prince a rescript annulling the\r\nproceedings. She does not seek a pardon, the Prince will state that the\r\nproceedings are unjust and shall have no consequences in the future,\r\nwhich is an absurd thing to expect of an absolute Sovereign. This\r\nabsurdity she demands, she obtains it. Mosca is magnificent in this\r\nscene where the lovers are alternately saved, lost, in peril for a\r\ngesture, a word, a glance!\r\n\r\nIn every walk of life, artists have an invincible self-respect, a sense\r\nof their art, a professional conscience which is ineradicable from the\r\nman. One does not corrupt, one never succeeds in buying this conscience.\r\nThe actor who wishes most harm to his theatre or to an author will never\r\nplay a part badly. The chemist, called in to look for arsenic in a body,\r\nwill find it if there is any there. The writer, the painter, are always\r\nfaithful to their genius, even at the foot of the scaffold. This does\r\nnot exist in woman. The universe is the stepping-stone of her passion.\r\nAnd so woman is greater and finer than man in this respect. Woman is\r\npassion; man is action. If this were not so, man would not adore woman.\r\nAnd so it is in the social circle of the court, which gives the greatest\r\nflight to her passion, that woman sheds her most brilliant radiance. Her\r\nfinest stage is the world of Absolute Power. That is why there are no\r\nlonger any women in France. Now Conte Mosca suppresses, from a trace of\r\nministerial self-respect, in the Prince\'s rescript, the words on which\r\nthe Duchessa depends. The Prince imagines that his Minister considers\r\nhim before the Sanseverina, and casts a glance at him which the reader\r\nintercepts. Mosca, like a true statesman, will not countersign a stupid\r\nthing, that is all: the Prince is mistaken. In the intoxication of her\r\ntriumph, rejoicing that she has saved Fabrizio, the Duchessa, who trusts\r\nin Mosca, does not peruse the rescript. She was thought to be ruined,\r\nshe had made all preparations for her departure in the face of Parma,\r\nshe returns from the court having effected a revolution. Mosca was\r\nthought to be in disgrace. Fabrizio\'s sentence was taken as an insult by\r\nthe Prince to the Duchessa and Minister. Not at all, the Raversi is\r\nbanished. The Prince laughs, he is holding his vengeance in reserve:\r\nthis woman who has humiliated him, he is going to make die of grief.\r\n\r\nThe Marchesa Raversi, instead of composing Ovidian _Tristia_, like\r\neveryone who is banished from a court where he or she handled the reins\r\nof power, sets to work. She guesses what has happened in the Prince\'s\r\ncabinet, she extracts his secrets from Rassi, who allows her to do so;\r\nhe is aware of the Prince\'s intentions. The Marchesa has some letters\r\nwritten by the Duchessa, she sends her lover to the galleys at Genoa to\r\nget a letter forged from the Duchessa to Fabrizio, telling him of her\r\ntriumph, and appointing a meeting at her country house. Sacca, close to\r\nthe Po, a delicious spot where the Duchessa always spends the summer.\r\nPoor Fabrizio hastens there, he is caught, they put handcuffs on him, he\r\nis shut up in the citadel, and while they are shutting him up, he\r\nrecognises the daughter of the governor, Fabio Conti, the lovely and\r\nsublime Clelia, for whom he is to feel that eternal love that gives no\r\nrespite.\r\n\r\nFabrizio del Dongo, her nephew, he whom she adores, in the most\r\nhonourable fashion, in the citadel! . . . Imagine the Duchessa\'s\r\nfeelings! She learns of Mosca\'s mistake. She will not see Mosca again.\r\nThere is only Fabrizio now in the world! Once inside that terrible\r\nfortress, he may die there, die there by poison!\r\n\r\nThis is the Prince\'s system: a fortnight of terror, a fortnight of hope.\r\nAnd he will handle this fiery steed, this proud soul, this Sanseverina\r\nwhose triumphs and happiness, though necessary to the brilliance of his\r\ncourt, were insulting to his inner man. Played on in this way, the\r\nSanseverina will become thin, old and ugly: he will knead her like\r\ndough.\r\n\r\nThis terrible duel in which the Duchessa has inflicted the first wound,\r\npiercing her adversary to the heart but without killing him, in which\r\nshe will receive for the next year a fresh wound daily, is the most\r\npowerful thing that the genius of the modern novel has invented.\r\n\r\nLet us turn now to Fabrizio in prison, and so come to my analysis of\r\nthat chapter, which is one of the diamonds on this crown.\r\n\r\nThe episode of the robbers in Lewis\'s _Monk_, his _Anaconda_, which is\r\nhis best book, the interest of the last volumes by Mrs. Radcliffe, the\r\nthrilling vicissitudes in the Red Indian romances of Cooper, all the\r\nextraordinary things I know in the narratives of travels and prisoners,\r\nnone of these can compare with the confinement of Fabrizio in the\r\nfortress of Parma, three hundred and something feet above the ground.\r\nThis terrifying abode is a Vaucluse: he makes love there to Clelia, he\r\nis happy there, he displays the ingenuity of prisoners, and he prefers\r\nhis prison to the most enchanting spot that the world has to offer. The\r\nBay of Naples is beautiful only through the eyes of Lamartine\'s Elvire;\r\nbut, in the eyes of a Clelia, in the trills of her voice, there are\r\nwhole universes. The author depicts, as he knows how to depict, by\r\nlittle incidents which have the eloquence of Shakespearean action, the\r\nprogress of the love between these two fair creatures, amid the dangers\r\nof an imminent death by poison. This part of the book will be read with\r\nhalting breath, straining throat, avid eyes by all those readers who\r\nhave imagination, or simply hearts. Everything in it is perfect, rapid,\r\nreal, without any improbability or strain. There you find passion in all\r\nits glory, its rendings, its hopes, its melancholies, its returns, its\r\nabatements, its inspirations, the only ones that equal those of genius.\r\nNothing has been forgotten. You will read there an encyclop\xc3\xa6dia of all\r\nthe resources of the prisoner; his marvellous languages for which he\r\nmakes use of nature, the means by which he gives life to a song and\r\nmeaning to a sound. Read in prison, this book is capable of killing a\r\nprisoner, or of making him tunnel through his walls.\r\n\r\nWhile Fabrizio is inspiring love and feeling it, during the most\r\nengrossing scenes of the drama inside the prison, there is, you must\r\nunderstand, a fight to the death going on outside the fortress. The\r\nPrince, the governor, Rassi, attempt to poison him. Fabrizio\'s death is\r\ndetermined upon at a moment when the Prince\'s vanity is mortally\r\nwounded. The charming Clelia, the most delicious figure you could see in\r\na dream, then reveals the extent of her love by helping Fabrizio to\r\nescape, although his rescuers have nearly killed her father, the\r\nGeneral.\r\n\r\nAt this crisis in the book, we understand all the incidents that have\r\ngone before. Without those adventures in which we have seen the people,\r\nin which we have watched them acting, nothing would be intelligible,\r\neverything would seem false and impossible.\r\n\r\nLet us return to the Duchessa. The courtiers, the Raversi party triumph\r\nin the griefs of this noble woman. Her calm is killing the Prince, and\r\nno one can explain it to him. Mosca himself does not understand it.\r\nHere, we see that Mosca, great as he is, is inferior to this woman who,\r\nat this moment, seems to you to be the genius of Italy. Profound is her\r\ndissimulation, bold are her plans. As for her revenge, it will be\r\ncomplete. The Prince has been too greatly offended, she sees him\r\nimplacable: between them, the duel is to the death; but the Duchessa\'s\r\nvengeance would be impotent, imperfect, if she allowed Ranuccio-Ernesto\r\nIV to take Fabrizio from her by poison. Fabrizio must be set at liberty.\r\nThis attempt seems literally impossible to every reader, so carefully\r\nhas tyranny taken its precautions, so deeply has it involved the\r\ngovernor, Fabio Conti, whose honour is at stake if he does not guard his\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nThere is in this man something of Hudson Lowe, but of a Hudson Lowe\r\nmagnified to the tenth degree; he is Italian, and wishes to avenge the\r\nRaversi for the disgrace that the Duchessa has brought on her. Gina\r\nfears nothing. This is why:\r\n\r\n"The lover thinks more often of penetrating to his mistress\'s chamber\r\nthan the husband of guarding his wife; the prisoner thinks more often of\r\nescaping than the gaoler of shutting his door; therefore, in spite of\r\nthe obstacles in their way, the lover and the prisoner must succeed in\r\nthe end."\r\n\r\nShe will help him! Oh, what a fine painting of this Italian in despair,\r\nwho cannot flee from this abhorrent court! "Come," she says to herself,\r\n"_forward, unhappy woman_" (we weep as we read this great feminine\r\nutterance), "do your duty, pretend to forget Fabrizio!" "_Forget him_!"\r\nthe word saves her: she has not been able to shed a tear until this\r\nword. Then the Duchessa conspires, she conspires with the Prime\r\nMinister, whom she has ostensibly banished in disgrace, but who would\r\nset Parma on fire and deluge it with blood for her, who would kill\r\neveryone, the Prince even. This true lover realises that he is in the\r\nwrong, he is the most wretched of men. Alas! What a feeble excuse! He\r\ndid not believe his master to be so false, so cowardly, so cruel. And so\r\nhe admits that his mistress is entitled to be implacable. He finds it\r\nnatural that Fabrizio should be, at this moment, everything in the world\r\nto her, he has that weakness of great men for their mistresses which\r\nleads them to understand even the infidelity which may mean their death.\r\nThe enamoured veteran is sublime! He says but one word to himself, in\r\nthe scene when Gina has made him come to her for their rupture. A single\r\nnight has ravaged the Duchessa.\r\n\r\n"Great God!" exclaims Mosca to himself, "she looks all her forty years\r\nto-day!"\r\n\r\nWhat a book is this in which one finds these cries of passion, these\r\nprofound diplomatic sayings, and on every page. Note this as well: you\r\nwill not meet in this book those extra flourishes, so aptly named\r\n_tartines_. No, the characters act, reflect, feel, and always the drama\r\nsweeps on. Never does the poet, a dramatist in his ideas, stoop in his\r\npath to pick the smallest flower, everything has the rapidity of a\r\ndithyramb.\r\n\r\nLet us proceed! The Duchessa is ravishing in her admissions to Mosca,\r\nand sublime in her despair. Finding her so changed, he supposes her to\r\nbe ill, and wishes to send for Razori, the leading doctor in Parma and\r\nin Italy.\r\n\r\n"Is that the counsel of a traitor or of a friend?" she asks. "You wish\r\nto convey to a stranger the measure of my despair!"\r\n\r\n"I am lost," thinks the Conte, "she no longer includes me even among the\r\ncommon men of honour."\r\n\r\n"Bear in mind," the Duchessa tells him with the most imperious air,\r\n"that I am not distressed by the capture of Fabrizio, that I have not\r\nthe least shadow of a desire to go away, that I am full of respect for\r\nthe Prince. As for yourself: I intend to have the entire control of my\r\nown behaviour, I wish to part from you as an old and good friend.\r\nConsider that I have reached sixty, the young woman is dead. With\r\nFabrizio in prison, I am incapable of love. Finally, I should be the\r\nunhappiest woman in the world were I to compromise your future. If you\r\nsee me making a show of having a young lover, do not let yourself be\r\ndistressed by that. I can swear to you, by Fabrizio\'s future happiness,\r\nthat I have never been guilty of the slightest infidelity towards you,\r\nand that in five whole years . . . that is a long time!" she says,\r\ntrying to smile. "I swear to you that I have never either planned or\r\nwished such a thing. Now you understand that, leave me."\r\n\r\nThe Conte goes, he spends two days and two nights in thought.\r\n\r\n"Great heavens!" he at length exclaims, "the Duchessa never said a word\r\nto me about an escape; can she have been wanting in sincerity for once\r\nin her life, and is the motive of her quarrel only a desire that I\r\nshould betray the Prince? No sooner said than done."\r\n\r\nDid I not tell you that this book was a masterpiece, and can you not see\r\nit for yourself, merely from this rough analysis?\r\n\r\nThe Minister, after this discovery, treads the ground as if he were a\r\nboy of fifteen, takes a new lease of life. He is going to seduce Rassi\r\nfrom the Prince, and make him his own creature.\r\n\r\n"Rassi," he says to himself, "is paid by his master to carry out the\r\nsentences that disgrace us throughout Europe, but he will not refuse to\r\nlet himself be paid by me to betray his master\'s secrets. He has a\r\nmistress and a confessor. The mistress is of so low an order that the\r\nmarket woman would know the whole story by to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\nHe goes to say his prayers at the cathedral and to find the Archbishop.\r\n\r\n"What sort of man is Dugnani, the Vicar of San Paolo?" he asks him.\r\n\r\n"A small mind with great ambition, few scruples and extreme poverty; for\r\nwe too have our vices!" says the Archbishop, raising his eyes to heaven.\r\n\r\nThe Minister cannot help laughing at the analytical depth reached by\r\ntrue piety combined with honesty. He sends for the priest and says to\r\nhim only:\r\n\r\n"You direct the conscience of my friend the Fiscal General; are you sure\r\nhe has nothing to tell me?"\r\n\r\nThe Conte is prepared to stake everything: there is only one thing that\r\nhe wishes to know, the moment at which Fabrizio will be in danger of\r\ndeath, and he does not propose to interfere with the Duchessa\'s plans.\r\nHis interview with Rassi is a capital scene. This is how the Conte\r\nbegins, adopting the tone of the most lofty impertinence:\r\n\r\n"What, sir, you carry off from Bologna a conspirator who is under my\r\nprotection; more than that, you propose to cut off his head, and you say\r\nnothing to me about it. Do you know the name of my successor? Is it\r\nGeneral Conti or yourself?"\r\n\r\nThe Minister and Fiscal agree upon a plan which allows them to retain\r\ntheir respective positions. I must leave to you the pleasure of reading\r\nthe admirable details of this continuous web in which the author drives\r\na hundred characters abreast without being more embarrassed than a\r\nskilful coachman is by the reins of a ten-horse coach. Everything is in\r\nits place, there is not the slightest confusion. You see everything, the\r\ntown and the court. The drama is amazing in its skill, its execution,\r\nits clearness. The air plays over the picture, not a character is\r\nsuperfluous. Lodovico, who on many occasions has proved that he is an\r\nhonest Figaro, is the Duchessa\'s right arm. He plays a fine part, he\r\nwill be well rewarded.\r\n\r\nThe time has now come to speak to you of one of the subordinate\r\ncharacters who is shown in colossal proportions, and to whom frequent\r\nreference is made in the book, namely Ferrante Palla, a Liberal doctor\r\nunder sentence of death who is wandering through Italy, where he\r\nperforms his task of propaganda.\r\n\r\nFerrante Palla is a great poet, like Silvio Pellico, but he is what\r\nPellico is not, a Radical Republican. Let us not concern ourselves with\r\nthe faith of this man. He has faith, he is the Saint Paul of the\r\nRepublic, a martyr of Young Italy, he is a sublime work of art like the\r\n_Saint Bartholomew_ at Milan, like Foyatier\'s _Spartacus_, like Marius\r\npondering over the ruins of Carthage. Everything that he does,\r\neverything that he says is sublime. He has the conviction, the grandeur,\r\nthe passion of the believer. However high you may place, in execution,\r\nin conception, in reality, the Prince, the Minister, the Duchessa,\r\nFerrante Palla, this superb statue, set in a corner of the picture,\r\ncommands your gaze, compels your admiration. In spite of your opinions,\r\nconstitutional, monarchical or religious, he subjugates you. Greater\r\nthan his own misfortunes, preaching Italy from the hollow shelter of his\r\ncaves, without bread for his mistress and their five children;\r\ncommitting highway robbery to maintain them, and keeping a note of the\r\nsums stolen and the persons robbed so as to restore to them this forced\r\nloan to the Republic when he shall have the power to do so; stealing\r\nmoreover in order to print his pamphlets entitled: _The necessity for a\r\nbudget in Italy_! Ferrante Palla is the type of a family of minds to be\r\nfound in Italy, sincere but misguided, full of talent but ignorant of\r\nthe fatal results of their doctrine. Send them with plenty of gold to\r\nFrance and to the United States, as Ministers of Absolute Princes!\r\nInstead of persecuting them, let them acquire enlightenment, these true\r\nmen, full of great and exquisite qualities. They will say like Alfieri\r\nin 1793: "Little men, at work, reconcile me to the great."\r\n\r\nI praise with all the more enthusiasm this creation of Ferrante Palla,\r\nhaving caressed the same figure myself. If I have the trifling advantage\r\nover M. Beyle of priority, I am inferior to him in execution. I have\r\nperceived this inward drama, so great, so powerful, of the stern and\r\nconscientious Republican in love with a Duchess who holds to Absolute\r\nPower. My Michel Chrestien, in love with the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse,\r\ncould not stand out with the relief of Ferrante Palla, a lover after the\r\nstyle of Petrarch of the Duchessa Sanseverina. Italy and its customs,\r\nItaly and its scenery, the perils, the starvation of Ferrante Palla are\r\nfar more attractive than the meagre details of Parisian civilisation.\r\nAlthough Michel Chrestien dies at Saint-Merry and Ferrante Palla escapes\r\nto the United States after his crimes, Italian passion is far superior\r\nto French passion, and the events of this episode add to their Apennine\r\nsavour an interest with which it is useless to compete. In a period when\r\neverything is levelled more easily under the uniform of the National\r\nGuard and the _Bourgeois_ law than under the steel triangle of the\r\nRepublic, literature is essentially lacking, in France, in those great\r\nobstacles between lovers which used to be the source of fresh beauties,\r\nof new situations, and which made subjects dramatic. And so it was\r\ndifficult for the serious paradox of the passion of a Radical for a\r\ngreat lady to escape trained pens.\r\n\r\nIn no book, unless it be _Old Mortality_, is there to be found a figure\r\nof an energy comparable to that which M. Beyle has given to Ferrante\r\nPalla, whose name exercises a sort of compulsion over the imagination.\r\nBetween Balfour of Burley and Ferrante Palla, I have no hesitation, I\r\nchoose Ferrante Palla; the design is the same; but Walter Scott, great\r\ncolourist as he may be, has not the thrilling, warm colour, as of\r\nTitian, which M. Beyle has spread over his character. Ferrante Palla is\r\na whole poem in himself, a poem superior to Lord Byron\'s _Corsair_. "Ah!\r\nThat is how people love!" is what all M. Beyle\'s feminine readers will\r\nsay to themselves on reading this sublime and most reprehensible\r\nepisode.\r\n\r\nFerrante Palla has the most impenetrable of retreats in the\r\nneighbourhood of Sacca. He has often seen the Duchessa, he has fallen\r\npassionately in love with her. The Duchessa has met him, has been moved.\r\nFerrante Palla has told her everything, as though in the presence of\r\nGod. He knows that the Duchessa loves Mosca, his own love therefore is\r\nhopeless. There is something touching in the Italian grace with which\r\nthe Duchessa lets him give himself the pleasure of kissing the white\r\nhands of a woman with blue blood. He has not clasped a white hand for\r\nseven years, and this poet adores beautiful white hands. His mistress,\r\nwhom he no longer loves, does the heavy work, makes clothes for the\r\nchildren, and he cannot desert a woman who will not leave him,\r\nnotwithstanding the most appalling poverty. These obligations of an\r\nhonest man become apparent. The Duchessa has compassion for everything,\r\nlike a true Madonna. She has offered him his pardon! Ah, but Ferrante\r\nPalla has, like Carl Sand, his own little sentences to enforce; he has\r\nhis preaching, his journeyings to rekindle the zeal of Young Italy.\r\n\r\n"All those scoundrels, who do so much harm to the people, would live for\r\nlong years," he says, "and whose fault would that be? What would my\r\nfather say when I meet him in heaven!"\r\n\r\nShe then proposes to provide for the needs of the woman and her\r\nchildren, and give him an undiscoverable hiding-place in the _palazzo_\r\nSanseverina.\r\n\r\nThe _palazzo_ Sanseverina includes an immense reservoir, built in the\r\nmiddle ages with a view to prolonged sieges, and capable of supplying\r\nthe town with water for a year. Part of the _palazzo_ is built over this\r\nimmense structure. The dapple-grey Duca spent the night after their\r\nmarriage in telling his wife the secret of the reservoir and of its\r\nhiding-place. An enormous stone which moves on a pivot will let all the\r\nwater escape and flood the streets of Parma. In one of the thick walls\r\nof the reservoir there is a chamber without light and without much air,\r\nwhich no one would ever suspect; you would have to pull down the\r\nreservoir to find it.\r\n\r\nFerrante Palla accepts the hiding-place for evil days, and refuses the\r\nDuchessa\'s money; he has made a vow never to have more than a hundred\r\nfrancs on him. At the moment when she offers him her sequins, he has\r\nmoney; but he lets himself go so far as to accept one sequin.\r\n\r\n"I take this sequin, because I love you," he says; "but I am on the\r\nwrong side of my hundred by five francs, and, if they were to hang me\r\nthis minute, I should feel remorse."\r\n\r\n"He does really love," the Duchessa says to herself.\r\n\r\nIs not that the simplicity of Italy, taken from life? Moli\xc3\xa8re, writing\r\na novel to describe this people, the only one except the Arabs that has\r\npreserved its reverence for vows, could do nothing finer.\r\n\r\nFerrante Palla becomes the Duchessa\'s other arm in her conspiracy, and\r\nis a terrible weapon, his energy makes one shudder! Here is the scene\r\nthat occurs one evening in the _palazzo_ Sanseverina. The lion of the\r\npeople has emerged from his retreat. He enters for the first time rooms\r\nablaze with regal splendour. He finds there his mistress, his idol, the\r\nidol whom he has set above Young Italy, above the Republic and the\r\nwelfare of humanity; he sees her distressed, tears in her eyes! The\r\nPrince has snatched from her him whom she loves best in the world, he\r\nhas basely deceived her, and this _tyrant_ holds the sword of Damocles\r\nover the beloved head.\r\n\r\n"What is happening here," says this sublime Republican Don Quixote, "is\r\nan injustice of which the Tribune of the People ought to take note. On\r\nthe other hand, as a private citizen, I can give the Signora Duchessa\r\nSanseverina nothing but my life, and I lay it at her feet. The creature\r\nyou see at your feet is not a puppet of the court, he is a man.--She has\r\nwept in my presence," he says to himself, "she is less unhappy."\r\n\r\n"Think of the risk you are running," says the Duchessa.\r\n\r\n"The Tribune will answer you: \'What is life when the voice of duty\r\nspeaks?\' The man will say to you: \'Here is a body of iron and a heart\r\nthat fears nothing in the world but your displeasure.\'"\r\n\r\n"If you speak to me of your feelings," says the Duchessa, "I shall not\r\nsee you again."\r\n\r\nFerrante Palla departs sadly.\r\n\r\nAm I mistaken? Are they not as fine as Corneille, these dialogues? And,\r\nremember, such passages abound, they are all, after their kind, at the\r\nsame high level. Struck by the beauty of this character, the Duchessa\r\nprepares a written document providing for the future of Ferrante\'s\r\nmistress and his five children, without saying anything to him, for she\r\nis afraid that he may let himself be killed on learning that his\r\ndependents have had this provision made for them.\r\n\r\nFinally, on the day when the whole of Parma is discussing the probable\r\ndeath of Fabrizio, the Tribune braves every danger. He enters the\r\n_palazzo_ at night, he arrives disguised as a Capuchin in the Duchessa\'s\r\npresence; he finds her drowned in tears and voiceless: she greets him\r\nwith her hand and points to a chair. Palla prostrates himself, prays to\r\nGod, so divine does her beauty seem to him, and breaks off his prayer to\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n"Once again _he_ offers his life."\r\n\r\n"Think of what you are saying!" cries the Duchessa with that haggard eye\r\nwhich shews more clearly than sobs that anger is mastering affection.\r\n\r\n"He offers his life to place all obstacle in the way of Fabrizio\'s fate\r\nor to avenge it."\r\n\r\n"If I were to accept!" she says, gazing at him.\r\n\r\nShe sees the joy of martyrdom flash in Palla\'s eye. She rises, goes to\r\nlook for the deed of gift prepared a month back, for Ferrante\'s mistress\r\nand children.\r\n\r\n"Read this!"\r\n\r\nHe reads it and falls on his knees, he sobs, he almost dies of joy.\r\n\r\n"Give me back the paper," says the Duchessa.\r\n\r\nShe burns it over a candle.\r\n\r\n"My name," she tells him, "must not appear. If you are taken and\r\nexecuted, if you are weak, I may be also, and Fabrizio would be in\r\ndanger. I wish you to sacrifice yourself."\r\n\r\n"I will perform the task faithfully, punctually and prudently."\r\n\r\n"If I am discovered and convicted," the Duchessa goes on proudly, "I\r\ndo not wish to be accused of having corrupted you. Do not put him to\r\ndeath until I give the signal. That signal will be the flooding of the\r\nstreets of Parma, of which you are bound to hear."\r\n\r\nFerrante, delighted by the Duchessa\'s tone of authority, takes his\r\nleave. When he has gone, the Duchessa calls him back.\r\n\r\n"Ferrante, sublime man!"\r\n\r\nHe returns.\r\n\r\n"And your children?"\r\n\r\n"Bah! You will provide for them."\r\n\r\n"Look, here are my diamonds."\r\n\r\nAnd she gives him a little olive-wood box.\r\n\r\n"They are worth fifty thousand francs."\r\n\r\n"Oh! Signora!" says Ferrante with a start of horror, "I may perhaps not\r\nsee you again. Take them, it is my wish."\r\n\r\nFerrante leaves her. The door closes behind him, the Duchessa again\r\ncalls him back. He sees her standing there, he comes back uneasily. The\r\ngreat Sanseverina throws herself into his arms. Ferrante is on the point\r\nof fainting. She allows him to kiss her, frees herself from his embrace\r\nwhen he threatens to become disrespectful, and shews him the door.\r\n\r\nShe remains standing for some time and says to herself.\r\n\r\n"That is the one man who has understood me; Fabrizio would be like that\r\nif he could only know me."\r\n\r\nI cannot lay too much stress on the merit of this scene. M. Beyle is not\r\nin the least a preacher. He does not urge you on to regicide, he gives\r\nyou a fact, states it as it occurred. No one, not even a Republican,\r\nfeels the desire to kill a tyrant on reading it. It is the play of\r\nprivate passions, that is all. It is a question of a duel which requires\r\nextraordinary, but equally matched arms. The Duchessa makes use of Palla\r\nto poison the Prince as the Prince makes use of one of Fabrizio\'s\r\nenemies to poison Fabrizio. One can avenge oneself on a king, Coriolanus\r\navenged himself well on his country, Beaumarchais and Mirabeau avenged\r\nthemselves well on their period which despised them. This is not moral,\r\nbut the author has told you of it, and washes his hands of it as Tacitus\r\nwashes his of the crimes of Tiberius. "I am inclined to believe," he\r\nsays, "that the immoral delight in taking revenge which one finds in\r\nItaly springs from the strength of imagination of that race; other races\r\ndo not forgive, they forget." Thus the moralist explains this energetic\r\npeople among whom we find so many inventors, who have the richest, the\r\nfinest imagination, with its accompanying drawbacks. This reflexion is\r\nmore profound than it appears at a first reading, it explains the\r\nrhetorical stupidities which weigh down the Italians, the only race that\r\nis comparable to the French, a race superior to the Russians or the\r\nEnglish, whose genius has the feminine fibre, that delicacy, that\r\nmajesty which make it in many respects superior to all other races. From\r\nthis point the Duchessa regains her advantage over the Prince. Hitherto,\r\nshe was weak and tricked in this great duel; Mosca, prompted by his\r\ncourtier\'s spirit, had been acting as second to the Prince. Now that her\r\nrevenge is assured, Gina feels her strength. Each step that her thoughts\r\ntake gives her happiness, she can play her part. The Tribune\'s courage\r\nheightens hers. Lodovico is electrified by her. These three\r\nconspirators, on whom Mosca shuts his eyes, while leaving his police\r\nfree to act against them if they notice anything, arrive at the most\r\nextraordinary result.\r\n\r\nThe Minister has been the dupe of his mistress, he fully believed\r\nhimself to be in disgrace, as he deserved. If he had not been thoroughly\r\ntaken in, he could never have played the part of a forlorn lover, for\r\nhappiness admits of no concealment. That fire of the heart has its\r\nsmoke. But, after the fascination of Ferrante by the Duchessa, her joy\r\nenlightens the Minister, he at last guesses her purpose, without knowing\r\nhow far she has gone.\r\n\r\nFabrizio\'s escape borders on the miraculous. It has required so much\r\nphysical strength and such an exercise of intelligence, that the dear\r\nboy is on the point of death: the scent of his aunt\'s clothing and\r\nhandkerchief revives him. This slight detail, which is not forgotten\r\namong a thousand other incidents, will delight those who are in love: it\r\nis placed, as might be placed in a finale a melody which recalls the\r\nsweetest elements of the life of love. All precautions have been\r\ncarefully taken, there is no indiscretion: Conte Mosca, who is present\r\nin person at the expedition with more than two dozen spies, does not\r\nreceive a single report of it as Minister.\r\n\r\n"Now I\'m committing high treason," he says to himself, blind with joy.\r\n\r\nEveryone has understood his orders without a word said, and escapes in\r\nhis own way. The business finished, each head has to think of and for\r\nitself. Lodovico is the courier, he crosses the Po. Ah! When Fabrizio is\r\nout of the reach of his crowned assassin, the Duchessa, who until then\r\nhad been crouching like a jaguar, coiled like a serpent hidden in the\r\nundergrowth, flat as one of Cooper\'s Indians in the mud, supple as a\r\nslave and feline as a deceitful woman, rises to her full height: the\r\npanther shews her claws, the serpent is going to sting, the Indian to\r\nutter his yell of triumph, she leaps for joy, she is mad. Lodovico, who\r\nknows nothing of Ferrante Palla, who says of him in the common phrase:\r\n"He is a poor man persecuted because of Napoleon!" Lodovico is afraid\r\nthat his mistress is going out of her mind. She gives him the small\r\nproperty of Ricciarda. He trembles on receiving this regal gift. What\r\nhas he done to deserve it? "Conspire, and for Monsignore, why that is a\r\npleasure."\r\n\r\nIt is then, the author tells us, that the Duchessa allows herself to\r\ncommit an act not only horrible in the eyes of morality, but fatal to\r\nthe tranquillity of her life. We suppose, of course, that in this hour\r\nof bliss, she will forgive the Prince. No.\r\n\r\n"If you wish to acquire the property, you must do two things," she tells\r\nLodovico, "and without exposing yourself. You must go back at once\r\nacross the Po, illuminate my house at Sacca in such a way as to make\r\npeople think it is on fire. I have prepared everything for this\r\nfestivity, in case we succeeded. There are lamps and oil in the cellars.\r\nHere is a line to my agent. Let the whole population of Sacca drink\r\nthemselves drunk, empty all my barrels and all my bottles. By the\r\nMadonna! If I find one full bottle, one barrel with two fingers of wine\r\nleft in it, you lose Ricciarda! When that is done, return to Parma and\r\nlet the water out of the reservoir. Wine for my dear people at Sacca,\r\nwater for the town of Parma!"\r\n\r\nThis makes one shudder. It is the Italian spirit, which M. Hugo has\r\nperfectly reproduced when he makes Lucrezia Borgia say: "You have given\r\nme a ball at Venice, I offer you in return a supper at Ferrara." The two\r\nspeeches are equivalent. Lodovico sees in this nothing more than a\r\nmagnificent insolence and an exquisite joke. He repeats: "Wine for the\r\npeople of Sacca, water for the people of Parma!" Lodovico returns after\r\nhaving carried out the Duchessa\'s orders, establishes her at Belgirate,\r\nand takes Fabrizio, who has still the Austrian police to fear, to\r\nLocarno, in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nFabrizio\'s escape, the illumination of Sacca throw the State of Parma\r\ninto utter confusion. Little attention is paid to the flooding of the\r\ntown. A similar event occurred at the time of the French invasion. A\r\nhorrible punishment awaits the Duchessa. She sees Fabrizio dying of love\r\nfor Clelia, resentful of being First Grand Vicar to the Archbishop and\r\nso unable to marry his beloved.\r\n\r\nIn the arms of his aunt and on Lake Maggiore, he dreams of his dear\r\nprison. What then are the sufferings of this woman who has ordered a\r\ncrime, who has so to speak brought down the moon from the sky by taking\r\nthis beloved boy out of prison, and who sees him so artless and simple,\r\nthinking of other things, refusing to perceive anything, and not\r\nallowing himself to succumb to what he had so wisely fled from in the\r\ncompany of his Gina, his mother, his sister, his aunt, his friend who\r\nlonged to be something more than a friend to him, all this torture is\r\nunspeakable; but, in the book, it is felt, it is seen. We are pained by\r\nFabrizio\'s desertion of the Sanseverina, although we are conscious that\r\nthe gratification of her love would be criminal. Fabrizio is not even\r\ngrateful. The ex-prisoner, like a Minister in retirement who dreams of\r\ncoalitions which will restore him to power, thinks only of his prison;\r\nhe sends for pictures of Parma, that city abhorrent to his aunt; he puts\r\none of the fortress in his bedroom. Finally, he writes a letter of\r\napology to General Conti for having escaped, so as to be able to say to\r\nClelia that he finds no happiness in liberty without her, and you can\r\nimagine what effect this letter (it is taken as a masterpiece of\r\necclesiastical irony) produces on the General: he swears that he will be\r\navenged. The Duchessa, terrified and brought back to a sense of\r\nself-preservation by the futility of her revenge, takes a boatman from\r\neach of the villages on Lake Maggiore; she makes them row her out to the\r\nmiddle of the lake; then she tells them that a search may be made for\r\nFabrizio, who served under Napoleon at Waterloo, and bids them keep a\r\nsharp watch; she makes herself loved, and obeyed; she pays well, and so\r\nhas a spy in every village; she gives each of them permission to enter\r\nher room at any hour, even at night when she is asleep. One evening, at\r\nLocarno, during a party, she hears of the death of the Prince of Parma.\r\nShe looks at Fabrizio.\r\n\r\n"I have done this for him; I would have done things a thousand times\r\nworse," she says to herself, "and look at him there, silent,\r\nindifferent, dreaming about another!"\r\n\r\nAt this thought she faints. This fainting-fit may be her ruin. The\r\ncompany gathers round her, Fabrizio thinks of Clelia: she sees him, she\r\nshudders, she finds herself surrounded by all these curious people, an\r\narchpriest, the local authorities, and so forth. She recovers the calm\r\nof a great lady, and says:\r\n\r\n"He was a great Prince, who was vilely slandered; it is an immense loss\r\nfor us.--Ah!" she says to herself, when she is alone, "it is now that I\r\nhave to pay for the transports of happiness and childish joy that I felt\r\nin my _palazzo_ at Parma when I welcomed Fabrizio there on his return\r\nfrom Naples. If I had said a word, all would have been over, I should\r\nhave left Mosca. Once he was with me, Clelia would never have meant\r\nanything to Fabrizio. Clelia wins, she is twenty. I am almost twice her\r\nage. I must die! _A woman of forty is no longer anything save for the\r\nmen who have loved her in her youth_!"\r\n\r\nIt is for this reflexion, profound in its shrewdness, suggested by grief\r\nand almost entirely true, that I quote this passage. The Duchessa\'s\r\nsoliloquy is interrupted by a noise outside, at midnight.\r\n\r\n"Good," she says, "they are coming to arrest me; so much the better, it\r\nwill occupy my mind, fighting them for my head."\r\n\r\nIt is nothing of the sort. Conte Mosca has sent her their most faithful\r\ncourier to inform her, before the rest of Europe, of recent events at\r\nParma, and of the details of the death of Ranuccio-Ernesto IV: there has\r\nbeen a revolution, the Tribune Ferrante Palla has been on the verge of\r\ntriumph, he has spent the fifty thousand francs, the price of the\r\ndiamonds, on the cause of his dear Republic instead of giving them to\r\nhis children; the rising has been suppressed by Mosca, who served under\r\nNapoleon in Spain, and who has displayed the courage of a soldier and\r\nthe coolness of a statesman; he has saved Rassi, which he will bitterly\r\nrepent; finally, he gives details of the accession to the throne of\r\nRanuccio-Ernesto V, a young prince who is enamoured of Signora\r\nSanseverina. The Duchessa is free to return. The Princess Dowager, who\r\nadores her for reasons which the reader knows and has gathered from the\r\nintrigues of the court at the time when the Duchessa reigned there,\r\nwrites her a charming letter, creates her Duchessa in her own right, and\r\nGrand Mistress. It would not, however, be prudent for Fabrizio to return\r\nat present, the sentence must be quashed by a retrial of the case.\r\n\r\nThe Duchessa conceals Fabrizio at Sacca, and returns to Parma\r\ntriumphant. Thus the subject revives of its own accord without effort,\r\nwithout monotony. There is not the slightest resemblance between the\r\nearly favour enjoyed by the innocent Sanseverina, under Ranuccio-Ernesto\r\nIV, and the favour enjoyed by the Duchessa who has had him poisoned,\r\nunder Ranuccio-Ernesto V. The young twenty-year-old Prince is madly in\r\nlove with her, the peril incurred by the criminal is balanced by the\r\nboundless power enjoyed by the Dowager\'s Grand Mistress. This Louis XIII\r\non a small scale finds his Richelieu in Mosca. The great Minister,\r\nduring the riots, carried away by a lingering trace of zeal, of\r\nenthusiasm, has called him a boy. The word has remained in the Prince\'s\r\nheart, it has hurt him. Mosca is useful to him; but the Prince, who is\r\nonly twenty years old in politics, is fifty in self-esteem. Rassi is\r\nworking in secret, he searches among the people and through all Italy,\r\nand learns that Ferrante Palla, who is as poor as Job, has sold nine or\r\nten diamonds at Genoa. During the underground burrowings of the Fiscal\r\nGeneral joy reigns at court. The Prince, a shy young man like all shy\r\nyoung men, attacks the woman of forty, grows frenzied in his pursuit of\r\nher; it is true that Gina, more beautiful than ever, does not look more\r\nthan thirty, she is happy, she is making Mosca thoroughly happy,\r\nFabrizio is saved, he is to be tried again, acquitted, and will be, when\r\nhis sentence is quashed. Coadjutor to the Archbishop, who is\r\nseventy-eight years old, with the right of eventual succession.\r\n\r\nClelia alone causes the Duchessa any misgivings. As for the Prince, she\r\nis amused by him. They act plays at court (those _commedie dell\' arte_\r\nin which each character invents the dialogue as he goes on, the outline\r\nof the plot being posted up in the wings--a sort of glorified charade).\r\nThe Prince takes the lovers\' parts, and Gina is always the leading lady.\r\nLiterally, the Grand Mistress is dancing upon a volcano. This part of\r\nthe work is charming. In the very middle of one of these plays, this is\r\nwhat happens. Rassi has said to the Prince: "Does Your Highness choose\r\nto pay a hundred thousand francs to find out the exact manner of His\r\naugust father\'s death?" He has had the hundred thousand francs, because\r\nthe Prince is a boy. Rassi has tried to corrupt the Duchessa\'s head\r\nmaid, this maid has told Mosca everything. Mosca has told her to let\r\nherself be corrupted. Rassi requires one thing only, to have the\r\nDuchessa\'s diamonds examined by two jewellers. Mosca posts counter-spies\r\nand learns that one of these inquisitive jewellers is Rassi\'s brother.\r\nMosca appears, between the acts of the play, to warn the Duchessa, whom\r\nhe finds in the highest spirits.\r\n\r\n"I have very little time," she says to Mosca, "but let us go into the\r\nguard-room."\r\n\r\nThere she says with a laugh to her friend the Minister:\r\n\r\n"You always scold me when I tell you unnecessary secrets; very well, it\r\nwas I who called Ernesto V to the throne; it was a case of avenging\r\nFabrizio, whom I loved far more than I love him to-day, though always\r\nquite innocently. You will scarcely believe in my innocence, but that\r\ndoes not matter, since you love me in spite of my crimes! Very well,\r\nthere is one crime in my life: Ferrante Palla had my diamonds. I did\r\nworse, I let myself be kissed by him so that he should poison the man\r\nwho wished to poison our Fabrizio. Where is the harm?"\r\n\r\n"And you tell me this in the guard-room?" says the Conte, _slightly\r\ntaken aback_!\r\n\r\nThis last expression is charming.\r\n\r\n"It is because I am in a hurry," she says, "Rassi is on the track: but I\r\nhave never spoken of insurrection, I abhor Jacobins. Think it over, and\r\ngive me your advice after the play."\r\n\r\n"I will give it you now," replies Mosca without hesitation. "You will\r\nbuttonhole the Prince behind the scenes, make him lose his head, but\r\nwithout doing anything dishonourable, you understand."\r\n\r\nThe Duchessa is called to go on the stage, and returns behind the\r\nscenes.\r\n\r\nFerrante Palla\'s farewell to his idol is one of the finest things in\r\nthis book, where there are so many fine things; but we come now to the\r\ncapital scene, to the scene which crowns the work, to the burning of the\r\npapers in the case drawn up by Rassi, which the Grand Mistress obtains\r\nfrom Ranuccio-Ernesto V and the Princess Dowager, a terrible scene, in\r\nwhich she is now lost, now saved, at the whim of the mother and son who\r\nfeel themselves overpowered by the force of character of this sort of\r\nPrincesse des Ursins. This scene occupies only eight pages, but it is\r\nwithout parallel in the art of literature. There is nothing analogous to\r\nwhich it can be compared, it is unique. I say nothing of it, it is\r\nsufficient to draw attention to it. The Duchessa triumphs, she destroys\r\nthe proofs and even carries away one of the documents for Mosca, who\r\ntakes note of the names of some of the witnesses and cries: "It was high\r\ntime, they were getting warm!" Rassi is in despair: the Prince has given\r\norders for a retrial of Fabrizio\'s case. Fabrizio, instead of making\r\nhimself a prisoner, as Mosca wishes, in the town prison, which is under\r\nthe Prime Minister\'s orders, returns at once to his beloved citadel,\r\nwhere the General, who thought that his honour had been tarnished by the\r\nescape, rigorously confines him with the intention of getting rid of\r\nhim. Mosca would have answered for him, with his life, in the town\r\nprison; but in the citadel Fabrizio is helpless.\r\n\r\nThis news comes as a bolt from the blue to the Duchessa: she remains\r\nspeechless and unhearing. Fabrizio\'s love for Clelia bringing him back\r\nto the place where death lies in wait for him and where the girl will\r\ngive him a moment\'s happiness for which he must pay with his life--the\r\nthought of this crushes her, and Fabrizio\'s imminent danger is the last\r\nstraw.\r\n\r\nThis danger exists already, it is not created to fit the scene, it is\r\nthe result of the passions aroused by Fabrizio during his former\r\nimprisonment, by his escape, by the fury of Rassi who has been forced to\r\nsign the order for a fresh trial. And so, even in the most minute\r\ndetails, the author loyally obeys the laws of the poetry of the novel.\r\nThis exact observation of the rules, whether it come from the\r\ncalculation, meditation, and natural deduction of a well chosen, well\r\ndeveloped and fruitful subject, or from the instinct peculiar to talent,\r\nproduces this powerful and permanent interest which we find in great, in\r\nfine works of art.\r\n\r\nMosca, in despair, makes the Duchessa understand the impossibility of\r\ngetting a young Prince to believe that a prisoner can be poisoned in his\r\nState, and offers to get rid of Rassi.\r\n\r\n"But," he tells her, "you know how squeamish I am about that sort of\r\nthing. Sometimes, at the end of the day, I still think of those two\r\nspies whom I had shot in Spain."\r\n\r\n"Rassi owes his life, then," replies the Duchessa, "to the fact that I\r\ncare more for you than for Fabrizio; I do not wish to poison the\r\nevenings of the old age which we shall have to spend together."\r\n\r\nThe Duchessa hastens to the fortress, and is there convinced of\r\nFabrizio\'s peril; she goes to the Prince. The Prince is a boy who, as\r\nthe Minister has foreseen, does not understand the danger that can\r\nthreaten an innocent person in his State Prison. He declines to\r\ndishonour himself, to pass judgment on his own justice. Finally, in view\r\nof the imminence of the peril (the poison has been given), the Duchessa\r\nwrests from him the order to set Fabrizio at liberty in exchange for a\r\npromise to yield to this young Prince\'s desires. This scene has an\r\noriginality of its own after that of the burning of the papers. At that\r\ntime, Gina\'s only thought was for herself, now it is for Fabrizio.\r\nFabrizio once acquitted and appointed Coadjutor to the Archbishop with\r\nthe right of eventual succession, which is tantamount to being made\r\nArchbishop, the Duchessa finds a way to elude the consequences of her\r\npromise by one of those dilemmas which women who are not in love can\r\nalways find with a maddening coolness. She is to the end the woman of\r\ngreat character whose career started as you have read. There follows a\r\nchange in the Ministry. Mosca leaves Parma with his wife, for the\r\nDuchessa and he, both widowed, have now married. But nothing goes well,\r\nand at the end of a year the Prince recalls Conte and Contessa Mosca.\r\nFabrizio is Archbishop and in high favour.\r\n\r\nThere follows the love of Clelia and Archbishop Fabrizio, which ends in\r\nthe death of Clelia, in that of a beloved child, and in the resignation\r\nand withdrawal of the Archbishop, who dies, doubtless after a long\r\nexpiation, in the Charterhouse of Parma.\r\n\r\nI explain this ending to you in a few words, since, in spite of\r\nbeautiful details, it is sketched rather than finished. If the author\r\nhad had to develop the romance of the end like that of the beginning, it\r\nwould have been difficult to know where to stop. Is there not a whole\r\ndrama in the love of a celibate priest? So there is a whole drama in the\r\nlove of the Coadjutor and Clelia. Book upon book!\r\n\r\nHad M. Beyle some woman in his mind when he drew his Sanseverina? I\r\nfancy so. For this statue, as for the Prince and the Prime Minister,\r\nthere must necessarily have been some model. Is she at Milan? Is she at\r\nRome, at Naples, at Florence? I cannot say. Although I am quite\r\nconvinced that there do exist women like the Sanseverina, though in very\r\nsmall numbers, and that I know some myself, I believe also that the\r\nauthor has perhaps enlarged the model and has completely idealised her.\r\nIn spite of this labour, which removes all similarity, one may find in\r\nthe Princesse B---- certain traits of the Sanseverina. Is she not\r\nMilanese? Has she not passed through good and adverse fortune? Is she\r\nnot shrewd and witty?\r\n\r\nYou know now the framework of this immense edifice, and I have taken you\r\nround it. My hasty analysis, bold, believe me, for it requires boldness\r\nto undertake to give you an idea of a novel constructed out of incidents\r\nas closely compressed as are those of _La Chartreuse de Parme_; my\r\nanalysis, dry as it may be, has outlined the masses for you, and you can\r\njudge whether my praise is exaggerated. But it is difficult to enumerate\r\nto you in detail the fine and delicate sculptures that enrich this solid\r\nstructure, to stop before the statuettes, the paintings, the landscapes,\r\nthe bas-reliefs which decorate it. This is what happened to me. At the\r\nfirst reading, which took me quite by surprise, I found faults in the\r\nbook. On my reading it again, the _longueurs_ vanished, I saw the\r\nnecessity for the detail which, at first, had seemed ta me too long or\r\ntoo diffuse. To give you a good account of it, I ran through the book\r\nonce more. Captivated then by the execution, I spent more time than I\r\nhad intended in the contemplation of this fine book, and everything\r\nstruck me as most harmonious, connected naturally or by artifice but\r\nconcordantly.\r\n\r\nHere, however, are the errors which I pick out, not so much from the\r\npoint of view of art as in view of the sacrifices which every author\r\nmust learn to make to the majority.\r\n\r\nIf I found confusion on first reading the bode, my impression will be\r\nthat of the public, and therefore evidently this book is lacking in\r\nmethod. M. Beyle has indeed disposed the events as they happened, or as\r\nthey ought to have happened; but he has committed, in his arrangement of\r\nthe facts, a mistake which many authors commit, by taking a subject true\r\nin nature which is not true in art. When he sees a landscape, a great\r\npainter takes care not to copy it slavishly, he has to give us not so\r\nmuch its letter as its spirit. So, in his simple, artless and unstudied\r\nmanner of telling his story, M. Beyle has run the risk of appearing\r\nconfused. Merit which requires to be studied is in danger of remaining\r\nunperceived. And so I could wish, in the interest of the book, that the\r\nauthor had begun with his magnificent sketch of the battle of Waterloo,\r\nthat he had reduced everything which precedes it to some account given\r\nby Fabrizio or about Fabrizio while he is lying in the village in\r\nFlanders where he arrives wounded. Certainly, the work would gain in\r\nlightness. The del Dongo father and son, the details about Milan, all\r\nthese things are not part of the book: the drama is at Parma, the\r\nprincipal characters are the Prince and his son. Mosca, Rassi, the\r\nDuchessa, Ferrante Palla, Lodovico, Clelia, her father, the Raversi,\r\nGiletti, Marietta. Skilled advisers or friends endowed with simple\r\ncommon sense might have procured the development of certain portions\r\nwhich the author has not supposed to be as interesting as they are, and\r\nwould have called for the excision of several details, superfluous in\r\nspite of their fineness. For instance, the work would lose nothing if\r\nthe Priore Blan\xc3\xa8s were to disappear entirely.\r\n\r\nI will go farther, and will make no compromise, in favour of this fine\r\nwork, over the true principles of art. The law which governs everything\r\nis that of unity in composition; whether you place this unity in the\r\ncentral idea or in the plan of the book, without it there can be only\r\nconfusion. So, in spite of its title, the work is ended when Conte and\r\nContessa Mosca return to Parma and Fabrizio is Archbishop. The great\r\ncomedy of the court is finished. It is so well finished, and the author\r\nhas so clearly felt this, that it is in this place that he sets his\r\nMoral, as our forerunners used to do at the end of their fables.\r\n\r\n"One can conclude with this moral," he says: "the man who comes to a\r\ncourt risks his happiness, if he is happy; and in any case makes his\r\nfuture depend upon the intrigues of a chambermaid.\r\n\r\n"On the other hand, in America, in the Republic, one has to waste one\'s\r\nwhole time paying serious court to the shopkeepers in the street and\r\nbecoming as stupid as themselves; and there, there is no Opera."\r\n\r\nIf, beneath the Roman purple and with a mitre on his head, Fabrizio\r\nloves Clelia, become Marchesa Crescenzi, and if you were telling us\r\nabout it, you would then wish to make the life of this young man the\r\nsubject of your book. But if you wished to describe the whole of\r\nFabrizio\'s life, you ought, being a man of such sagacity, to call your\r\nbook Fabrizio, or the Italian in the Nineteenth Century. In launching\r\nhimself upon such a career, Fabrizio ought not to have found himself\r\noutshone by figures so typical, so poetical as are those of the two\r\nPrinces, the Sanseverina, Mosca, Ferrante Palla. Fabrizio ought to have\r\nrepresented the young Italian of to-day. In making this young man the\r\nprincipal figure of the drama, the author was under an obligation to\r\ngive him a large mind, to endow him with a feeling which would make him\r\nsuperior to the men of genius who surround him, and which he lacks.\r\nFeeling, in short, is equivalent to talent. _To feel_ is the rival of\r\n_to understand as to act_ is the opposite of _to think_. The friend of a\r\nman of genius can raise himself to his level by affection, by\r\nunderstanding. In matters of the heart, an inferior man may prevail over\r\nthe greatest artist. There lies the justification of those women who\r\nfall in love with imbeciles. So, in a drama, one of the most ingenious\r\nresources of the artist is (in the case in which we suppose M. Beyle to\r\nbe) to make a hero superior by his feeling when he cannot by genius\r\ncompete with the people among whom he is placed. In this respect,\r\nFabrizio\'s part requires recasting. The genius of Catholicism ought to\r\nurge him with its divine hand towards the _Charterhouse of Parma_, and\r\nthat genius ought from time to time to overwhelm him with the tidings of\r\nheavenly grace. But then the Priore Blan\xc3\xa8s could not perform this part,\r\nfor it is impossible to cultivate judicial astrology and to be a saint\r\naccording to the Church. The book ought therefore to be either shorter\r\nor longer.\r\n\r\nPossibly the slowness of the beginning, possibly that ending which\r\nbegins a new book and in which the subject is abruptly strangled, will\r\ndamage its success, possibly they have already damaged it. M. Beyle has\r\nmoreover allowed himself certain repetitions, perceptible only to those\r\nwho know his earlier books; but such readers themselves are necessarily\r\nconnoisseurs, and so fastidious. M. Beyle, keeping in mind that great\r\nprinciple: "Unlucky in love, as in the arts, who says too much!" ought\r\nnot to repeat himself, he, always concise and leaving much to be\r\nguessed. In spite of his sphinx-like habit, he is less enigmatic here\r\nthan in his other works, and his true friends will congratulate him on\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nThe portraits are brief. A few words are enough for M. Beyle, who paints\r\nhis characters both by action and by dialogue; he does not weary one\r\nwith descriptions, he hastens to the drama and arrives at it by a word,\r\nby a thought. His landscapes, traced with a somewhat dry touch which,\r\nhowever, is suited to the country, are lightly done. He takes his stand\r\nby a tree, on the spot where he happens to be; he shews you the lines of\r\nthe Alps which on all sides enclose the scene of action, and the\r\nlandscape is complete. The book is particularly valuable to travellers\r\nwho have strolled by the Lake of Como, over the Brianza, who have passed\r\nunder the outermost bastions of the Alps and crossed the plains of\r\nLombardy. The spirit of those scenes is finely revealed, their beauty is\r\nwell felt. One can see them.\r\n\r\nThe weak part of this book is the style, in so far as the arrangement of\r\nthe words goes, for the thought, which is eminently French, sustains the\r\nsentences. The mistakes that M. Beyle makes are purely grammatical; he\r\nis careless, incorrect, after the manner of seventeenth-century writers.\r\nThe quotations I have made shew what sort of faults he lets himself\r\ncommit. In one place, a discord of tenses between verbs, sometimes the\r\nabsence of a verb; here, again, sequences of _c\'est_, of _ce que_, of\r\n_que_, which weary the reader, and have the effect on his mind of a\r\njourney in a badly hung carriage over a French road. These quite glaring\r\nfaults indicate a scamping of work. But, if the French language is a\r\nvarnish spread over thought, we ought to be as indulgent towards those\r\nin whom it covers fine paintings as we are severe to those who shew\r\nnothing but the varnish. If, in M. Beyle, this varnish is a little\r\nyellow in places and inclined to scale off in others, he does at least\r\nlet us see a sequence of thoughts which are derived from one another\r\naccording to the laws of logic. His long sentence is ill constructed,\r\nhis short sentence lacks polish. He writes more or less in the style of\r\nDiderot, who was not a writer; but the conception is great and strong;\r\nthe thought is original, and often well rendered. This system is not one\r\nto be imitated. It would be too dangerous to allow authors to imagine\r\nthemselves to be profound thinkers.\r\n\r\nM. Beyle is saved by the deep feeling that animates his thought. All\r\nthose to whom Italy is dear, who have studied or understood her, will\r\nread _La Chartreuse de Parme_ with delight. The spirit, the genius, the\r\ncustoms, the soul of that beautiful country live in this long drama that\r\nis always engaging, in this vast fresco so well painted, so strongly\r\ncoloured, which moves the heart profoundly and satisfies the most\r\ndifficult, the most exacting mind. The Sanseverina is the Italian woman,\r\na figure as happily portrayed as Carlo Dolci\'s famous head of _Poetry_,\r\nAllori\'s _Judith_, or Guercino\'s _Sibyl_ in the Manfredini gallery. In\r\nMosca he paints the man of genius in politics at grips with love. It is\r\nindeed love without speech (the speeches are the weak point in\r\n_Clarisse_), active love, always true to its own type, love stronger\r\nthan the call of duty, love, such as women dream of, such as gives an\r\nadditional interest to the least things in life. Fabrizio is quite the\r\nyoung Italian of to-day at grips with the distinctly clumsy despotism\r\nwhich suppresses the imagination of that fine country; but, as I have\r\nsaid above, the dominant thought or the feeling which urges him to lay\r\naside his dignities and to end his life in a Charterhouse needs\r\ndevelopment. This book is admirably expressive of love as it is felt in\r\nthe South. Obviously, the North does not love in this way. All these\r\ncharacters have a heat, a fever of the blood, a vivacity of hand, a\r\nrapidity of mind which is not to be found in the English nor in the\r\nGermans nor in the Russians, who arrive at the same results only by\r\nprocesses of revery, by the reasonings of a smitten heart, by the slow\r\nrising of their sap. M. Beyle has in this respect given this book the\r\nprofound meaning, the feeling which guarantees the survival of a\r\nliterary conception. But unfortunately it is almost a secret doctrine,\r\nwhich requires laborious study. _La Chartreuse de Parme_ is placed at\r\nsuch a height, it requires in the reader so perfect a knowledge of the\r\ncourt, the place, the people that I am by no means astonished at the\r\nabsolute silence with which such a book has been greeted. That is the\r\nlot that awaits all books in which there is nothing vulgar. The secret\r\nballot in which vote one by one and slowly the superior minds who make\r\nthe name of such works, is not counted until long afterwards. Besides,\r\nM. Beyle is not a courtier, he has the most profound horror of the\r\npress. From largeness of character or from the sensitiveness of his\r\nself-esteem, as soon as his book appears, he takes flight, leaves Paris,\r\ntravels two hundred and fifty leagues in order not to hear it spoken of.\r\nHe demands no articles, he does not haunt the footsteps of the\r\nreviewers. He has behaved thus after the publication of each of his\r\nbooks. I admire this pride of character or this sensitiveness of\r\nself-esteem. Excuses there may be for mendicity, there can be none for\r\nthat quest for praise and articles on which modern authors go begging.\r\nIt is the mendicity, the pauperism of the mind. There are no great works\r\nof art that have fallen into oblivion. The lies, the complacencies of\r\nthe pen cannot give life to a worthless book.\r\n\r\nAfter the courage to criticise comes the courage to praise. Certainly it\r\nis time someone did justice to M. Beyle\'s merit. Our age owes him much:\r\nwas it not he who first revealed to us Rossini, the finest genius in\r\nmusic? He has pleaded constantly for that glory which France had not the\r\nintelligence to make her own. Let us in turn plead for the writer who\r\nknows Italy best, who avenges her for the calumnies of her conquerors,\r\nwho has so well explained her spirit and her genius.\r\n\r\nI had met M. Beyle twice in society, in twelve years, before the day\r\nwhen I took the liberty of congratulating him on _La Chartreuse de\r\nParme_ on meeting him in the Boulevard des Italiens. On each occasion,\r\nhis conversation has fully maintained the opinion I had formed of him\r\nfrom his works. He tells stories with the spirit and grace which M.\r\nCharles Nodier and M. de Latouche possess in a high degree. Indeed he\r\nrecalls the latter gentleman by the irresistible charm of his speech,\r\nalthough his physique--for he is extremely stout--seems at first sight\r\nto preclude refinement, elegance of manners; but he instantly disproves\r\nthis suspicion, like Dr. Koreff, the friend of Hoffmann. He has a fine\r\nforehead, a keen and piercing eye, a sardonic mouth; in short, he has\r\naltogether the physiognomy of his talent. He retains in conversation\r\nthat enigmatic turn, that eccentricity which leads him never to sign the\r\nalready illustrious name of Beyle, to call himself one day Cotonnet,\r\nanother Fr\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ric. He is, I am told, the nephew of the famous and\r\nindustrious Daru, one of the strong arms of Napoleon. M. Beyle was\r\nnaturally in the Emperor\'s service; 1815 tore him, necessarily, from his\r\ncareer, he passed from Berlin to Milan, and it is to the contrast\r\nbetween the life of the North and that of the South, which impressed\r\nhim, that we are indebted for this writer. M. Beyle is one of the\r\nsuperior men of our time. It is difficult to explain how this observer\r\nof the first order, this profound diplomat who, whether in his writings\r\nor in his speech, has furnished so many proofs of the loftiness of his\r\nideas and the extent of his practical knowledge should find himself\r\nnothing more than Consul at Civita-vecchia. No one could be better\r\nqualified to represent France at Rome. M. M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e knew M. Beyle\r\nearly and takes after him; but the master is more elegant and has more\r\nease. M. Beyle\'s works are many in number and are remarkable for\r\nfineness of observation and for the abundance of their ideas. Almost all\r\nof them deal with Italy. He was the first to give us exact information\r\nabout the terrible case of the Cenci; but he has not sufficiently\r\nexplained the causes of the execution, which was independent of the\r\ntrial, and due to factional clamour, to the demands of avarice. His book\r\n_De l\'amour_ is superior to M. de S\xc3\xa9nancour\'s, he shews affinity to the\r\ngreat doctrines of Cabanis and the School of Paris; but he fails by the\r\nlack of method which, as I have already said, spoils _La Chartreuse de\r\nParme_. He has ventured, in this treatise, upon the word\r\n_crystallisation_ to explain the phenomenon of the birth of this\r\nsentiment, a word which has been taken as a joke, but will survive on\r\naccount of its profound accuracy. M. Beyle has been writing since 1817.\r\nHe began with a certain show of Liberalism; but I doubt whether this\r\ngreat calculator can have let himself be taken in by the stupidities of\r\nDual Chamber government. _La Chartreuse de Parme_ has an underlying bias\r\nwhich is certainly not against Monarchy. He finds fault with what he\r\nadmires, he is a Frenchman.\r\n\r\nM. de Chateaubriand said, in a preface to the eleventh edition of\r\n_Atala_, that his book in no way resembled the previous editions, so\r\nthoroughly had he revised it. M. le Comte de Maistre admits having\r\nrewritten _Le L\xc3\xa9preux de la vall\xc3\xa9e d\'Aoste_ seventeen times. I hope\r\nthat M. Beyle also will set to work going over, polishing _La Chartreuse\r\nde Parme_, and will stamp it with the imprint of perfection, the emblem\r\nof irreproachable beauty which MM. de Chateaubriand and de Maistre have\r\ngiven to their precious books.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: So Balzac, reading _les petites mains les plus gracieuses_.\r\nStendhal\'s words are _les petites mines_, and he makes the lady a\r\nMarchesa. Balzac\'s quotations are not, as a rule, textually accurate,\r\nbut his analysis of the story is admirable.\r\n\r\nC. K. S. M.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: What a phrase, indeed. But it is the Duchessa, not Mosca,\r\nwho gives this advice to Fabrizio, at Piacenza, and it is the party\r\n"opposite to the one he has served all his life" that he is to be flung\r\ninto.\r\n\r\nC. K. S. M.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis article opened the third and concluding number of Balzac\'s _Revue\r\nParisienne_, dated September 25, 1840. Each of the earlier numbers had\r\nopened with a story, viz.; _Z. Marcas_ and _Les Fantaisies de Claudine_\r\n(_Un Prince de la Boh\xc3\xa8me_) afterwards embodied in the _Com\xc3\xa9die\r\nHumaine_. This _Etude sur M. Beyle_ will be found in _\xc5\x92uvres compl\xc3\xa8tes\r\nde H. de Balzac--XXIII--\xc5\x92uvres diverses--septi\xc3\xa8me partie--Essais\r\nhistoriques et politiques_--Paris, Michel L\xc3\xa9vy Fr\xc3\xa8res, Editeurs, &c.,\r\n873, pages 687 to 738. It is also reprinted in L\xc3\xa9vy\'s 1853 edition of\r\n_La Chartreuse de Parme_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEYLE\'S REPLY TO BALZAC\r\n\r\n\r\nOn receiving the _Revue Parisienne_, Beyle at once wrote to Balzac the\r\nletter a translation of which follows. This letter he seems to have\r\nentrusted to his friend Romain Colomb, afterwards his literary executor,\r\nin whose hands it still remained six months later. As published by\r\nColomb, the letter includes the text actually addressed to Balzac and\r\nthe draft here appended to it, and it so figures in _Stendhal: \xc5\x92uvres\r\nPosthumes: Correspondance In\xc3\xa9dite pr\xc3\xa9c\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9e d\'une Introduction par\r\nProsper M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e de l\'Acad\xc3\xa9mie Fran\xc3\xa7aise_: Vol. II, pp. 293-299\r\n(Calmann-L\xc3\xa9vy). The correct text was established by M. Paul Arbelet in\r\nthe _Revue d\'Histoire Litt\xc3\xa9raire de la France_, Oct.-Dec., 1917, pp.\r\n548 sqq. _La v\xc3\xa9ritable lettre de Stendhal_, and reprinted by MM. G.\r\nGr\xc3\xa8s & Cie. in their edition of _La Chartreuse de Parme_ (1922).\r\n\r\n\r\nCivita-vecchia, 30th October, 1840.\r\n\r\nLast night, Sir, I received a great surprise. No one, I think, has ever\r\nbeen so well treated in a Review, and by the best judge of the subject.\r\nYou have taken pity on an orphan left wandering in the street. I have\r\nmade a fitting response to this kindness, I read the review last night,\r\nand this morning I have cut down to four or five pages the fifty-four\r\nopening pages[3] of the work which you have introduced to the world.\r\n\r\nThe confection of literature would have disgusted me with all pleasure\r\nin writing; I have dismissed all rejoicings over the printed page, to a\r\ntime twenty or thirty years hence. Some literary rag-picker may make the\r\ndiscovery of the works whose merit you so strangely exaggerate.\r\n\r\nYour illusion goes a long way, _Ph\xc3\xa8dre_, for instance. I may admit to\r\nyou that I was shocked, I who am quite well-disposed towards the author.\r\n\r\nSince you have taken the trouble to read this novel three times, I shall\r\nhave a number of questions to ask you at our next meeting on the\r\nboulevard.\r\n\r\n1. Am I allowed to call Fabrizio _our_ hero? It was a question of not\r\nrepeating the name Fabrizio too often.\r\n\r\n2. Ought I to suppress the episode of _Fausta_, which has turned out\r\nunduly long? Fabrizio seizes the opportunity that is offered him to shew\r\nto the Duchessa that he is not susceptible to _love_.\r\n\r\n3. The fifty-four opening pages seem to me a graceful introduction. I\r\ndid indeed feel some misgivings when correcting the proofs, but I\r\nthought of those boring first half-volumes of Walter Scott, and of the\r\nendless preamble to the divine _Princesse de Cl\xc3\xa8ves_.\r\n\r\nI abhor an involved style, and I must admit to you that many pages of\r\nthe _Chartreuse_ were printed from my original dictation. As children\r\nsay: I shall not return to it again. I think, however, that since the\r\ndestruction of the court, in 1792, the part played by form becomes more\r\nexiguous daily. Were M. Villemain, whom I cite as the most distinguished\r\nof our Academicians, to translate the _Chartreuse_ into French, he would\r\nrequire three volumes to express what I have given in two. The majority\r\nof scoundrels being emphatic and eloquent, people will take a dislike to\r\nthe declamatory tone. At seventeen I came near to fighting a duel over\r\nthe "indeterminate crest of the forests" of M. de Chateaubriand, who\r\nnumbered many admirers in the 6th Dragoons. I have never read _La\r\nChaumi\xc3\xa8re indienne_, I cannot abide M. de Maistre.\r\n\r\nMy Homer is the _Memoirs_ of Marshal Gouvion Saint-Cyr. Montesquieu and\r\nF\xc3\xa9nelon\'s _Dialogues_ strike me as well written. Except for Madame de\r\nMortsauf and her companions, I have read nothing of what has been\r\nprinted in the last thirty years. I read Ariosto, whose stories I love.\r\nThe Duchessa is copied from Correggio. I see the future history of\r\nFrench literature in the history of painting. We have reached the stage\r\nof the pupils of Pietro da Cortona, who worked rapidly and strained all\r\nhis expressions, like Madame Cottin who makes the hewn stones of the\r\nBorromean Islands walk. After this novel, I have no . . .[4] While\r\ncomposing the Chartreuse, to acquire the tone, I used to read every\r\nmorning two or three pages of the _Code Civil_.\r\n\r\nPermit a coarse expression: I do not wish to b---- the heart of the\r\nreader. This, poor reader lets ambitious phrases pass, such as "the wind\r\nthat uproots the waves," but they come back to him after the moment of\r\nemotion. I wish on the other hand that, if the reader thinks of Conte\r\nMosca, he shall find nothing to cut down.\r\n\r\n4. I am going to introduce, in the _foyer_ of the Opera, Bassi and\r\nRiscara, sent to Paris as spies after Waterloo by Ranuccio-Ernesto IV.\r\nFabrizio returning from Amiens will be struck by their Italian\r\nappearance and clipped Milanese, which these watchers imagine to be\r\nunderstood by no one. Everyone tells me that I must announce my\r\ncharacters. I shall greatly reduce the good Priore Blan\xc3\xa8s. I thought\r\nthat the story needed characters who do nothing, and only touch the\r\nheart of the reader and dispel the air of romance.\r\n\r\nYou are going to think me a monster of pride. What, your inward sense\r\nwill say, this creature, not content with what I have done for him, a\r\nthing without parallel in this century, still wishes to be praised for\r\nhis style!\r\n\r\nI see but one rule: _to be clear_. If I am not clear, all my world\r\ncrumbles to nothing. I wish to speak of what is occurring in the heart\r\nof Mosca, of the Duchessa, of Clelia. It is a country into which hardly\r\npenetrates the gaze of the newly rich, such as the Latinist Master of\r\nthe Mint, M. le Comte Roy, M. Laffitte, etc., etc., etc., the gaze of\r\nthe grocer, the worthy paterfamilias, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nIf, to the obscurity of the matter, I add the obscurities of style of M.\r\nVillemain, of Madame Sand, etc. (supposing me to have the rare privilege\r\nof being able to write like those _choregi_ of good style), if I add to\r\nthe difficulty of the subject the obscurities of this vaunted style, no\r\none in the world will understand the struggle between the Duchessa and\r\nErnesto IV. The style of M. de Chateaubriand and M. de Villemain seems\r\nto me to say: 1. a number of pleasant little things, but things not\r\nworth saying (like the style of Ausonius, Claudian, etc.); 2. a number\r\nof little _insincerities_, pleasant to listen to. These great\r\nAcademicians would have seen the public go mad over their writings, had\r\nthey been given to the world in 1780; their chance of greatness depended\r\nupon the old _r\xc3\xa9gime_.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the semi-intelligent become more numerous, the part\r\nplayed by form decreases. If the _Chartreuse_ were translated into\r\nFrench by Madame Sand, she would make it a success, but, in order to\r\nexpress what there is in my two volumes, she would need three or four.\r\nWeigh this excuse.\r\n\r\nThe semi-intelligent puts above everything else the verse of Racine, for\r\nhe can understand what is meant by an unfinished line; but every day his\r\nverse becomes a less important factor in Racine\'s merit. The public, as\r\nit grows more numerous, less sheeplike, requires a greater quantity of\r\n_little actual facts_, as to a passion, a situation in real life, etc.\r\nHow often do we find Voltaire, Racine, etc., all of them in fact except\r\nCorneille, obliged to _cap_ their lines for the sake of the rhyme; well,\r\nthese capping lines occupy the place that should properly be filled by\r\nlittle actual facts.\r\n\r\nIn fifty years\' time M. Bignan, and the Bignans who write in prose will\r\nhave so wearied their public with productions that are elegant and\r\ndevoid of any other merit, that the semi-intelligent will be in great\r\ndifficulties; their vanity requiring them always to speak of literature\r\nand to make a pretence of thought, what will become of them when they\r\ncan no longer attach themselves to form? They will end by making their\r\ngod of Voltaire. Wit lasts no more than two centuries; in 1978, Voltaire\r\nwill be Voiture; but _Le P\xc3\xa8re Goriot_ will still be _Le P\xc3\xa8re Goriot_.\r\nPerhaps the semi-intelligent will be so distressed at no longer having\r\ntheir beloved rules to admire that it is highly possible that they will\r\ngrow disgusted with literature and take to religion. All political\r\nrascals having a declamatory and eloquent tone, people will have grown\r\nsick of this in 1880. Then perhaps they will read the _Chartreuse_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following passage occurs among the Beyle manuscripts at Grenoble,\r\nand was added to the printed text of the letter by Colomb. It appears\r\nrather to be alternative to some of the preceding paragraphs.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe part played by _form_ becomes more exiguous daily. Take Hume;\r\nimagine a History of France from 1780 to 1840, written with Hume\'s sound\r\nsense; it would be read, even if it were written in patois; it[5] is\r\nwritten like the _Code Civil_. I am going to correct the style of the\r\n_Chartreuse_, since it hurts you, but I shall find it most difficult. I\r\ndo not admire the style now in fashion, I have no patience with it. I\r\nsee Claudians, Senecas, Ausoniuses. I have been told for the last year\r\nthat one ought now and then to relax the reader\'s attention by\r\ndescribing scenery, dresses. These things have bored me so in other\r\nwriters! I shall try.\r\n\r\nAs for immediate success, of which I should never have thought but for\r\nthe _Revue Parisienne_, it is quite fifteen years since I said to\r\nmyself: I should become a candidate for the Academy if I won the hand of\r\nMademoiselle Bertin, who would have my praises sung three times weekly.\r\nWhen society is no longer tainted with common upstarts, valuing above\r\neverything else nobility, just because they are ignoble, it will no\r\nlonger be on its knees before the press of the aristocracy. Before 1793\r\ngood company was the true judge of books, now it is haunted by the fear\r\nof another 1793, it is frightened, it is no longer a judge. Look at the\r\ncatalogue which a little bookseller near Saint-Thomas-d\'Aquin (Rue du\r\nBac, about No. 110) supplies to the nobility, his neighbours. It is the\r\nargument that has most convinced me of the impossibility of pleasing\r\nthese timid creatures, stupefied by idleness.\r\n\r\nI have not in the least copied M. de Metternich, whom I have not seen\r\nsince 1810, at Saint-Cloud, when he wore a bracelet of the hair of\r\nCaroline Murat, who was such a beauty then. I feel no regret for all\r\nthat is destined not to happen. I am a fatalist, and hide from it. I\r\nimagine that I shall perhaps have a little success about 1860 or \'80.\r\nThen there will be very little said of M. de Metternich, and even less\r\nof the petty Prince. Who was Prime Minister of England in the time of\r\nMalherbe? If I have not the misfortune to hit upon a Cromwell, I am sure\r\nof a nonentity.\r\n\r\nDeath makes us change places with these people. They can do anything\r\nwith our bodies during their lives, but, at the moment of death,\r\noblivion enwraps them for ever. Who will speak of M. de Vill\xc3\xa8le, of M.\r\nde Martignac, in a hundred years\' time? M. de Talleyrand himself will be\r\npreserved only by his _Memoirs_, if he has left good ones, while _Le\r\nRoman comique_ is to-day what _Le P\xc3\xa8re Goriot_ will be in 1980. It is\r\nScarron who makes known the name of the Rothschild of his day, M. de\r\nMontauron, who was also, to the extent of fifty louis, the protector of\r\nCorneille.\r\n\r\nYou have well felt, Sir, with the tact of a man who has acted, that the\r\n_Chartreuse_ could not deal with a great State, such as France, Spain,\r\nVienna, on account of the administrative detail. I was left with the\r\npetty Princes of Germany and Italy.\r\n\r\nBut the Germans are so much on their knees before a riband, they are\r\nsuch fools! I spent several years among them, and have forgotten their\r\nlanguage, out of contempt for them. You can easily see that my\r\ncharacters could not be Germans. If you follow this idea, you will find\r\nthat I have been led by the hand to an extinct dynasty, to a Farnese,\r\nthe least obscure of these _extinct_ personages, on account of the\r\nGenerals, his grandsires.\r\n\r\nI take a character well-known to myself, I leave him the habits he has\r\ncontracted in the art of going out every morning in pursuit of pleasure,\r\nthen I give him more intelligence. I have never seen Signora di\r\nBelgiojoso. Rassi was a German; I have talked to him hundreds of times.\r\nI picked up the Prince while staying at Saint-Cloud in 1810 and 1811.\r\n\r\nOuf! I hope that you will have read this treatise three times. You say,\r\nSir, that you do not know English: you have in Paris the _bourgeois_\r\nstyle of Walter Scott in the heavy prose of M. Del\xc3\xa9cluze, editor of the\r\n_D\xc3\xa9bats_, and author of a _Mademoiselle de Liron_ which has something\r\nin it. Walter Scott\'s prose is inelegant and above all pretentious. One\r\nsees a dwarf who is determined not to lose an inch of his stature.\r\n\r\nThis astounding article, such as no writer has ever received from\r\nanother, I have read, I now make bold to confess to you, with shouts of\r\nlaughter, whenever I came to an encomium that was at all strong, and I\r\nmet them at every turn. I could see the expression on the faces of my\r\nfriends as they read it.\r\n\r\nFor instance the Minister d\'Argout, being then Auditor to the Council of\r\nState, was my equal and, moreover, what is known as a friend; 1830\r\ncomes, he is a Minister, his clerks, whom I do not know, think that\r\nthere are at least thirty artists. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _i.e._, Chapters I and II.\r\n\r\nC.

I found there\r\nthe Canon\'s nephew and his wife who welcomed me like an old friend.\r\nSeveral people came in, and we did not break up until a very late hour;\r\nthe nephew sent out to the Caff\xc3\xa8 Pedrocchi for an excellent _zabaione_.\r\nWhat more than anything kept us up was the story of the Duchessa\r\nSanseverina, to which someone made an allusion, and which the nephew was\r\ngood enough to relate from beginning to end, in my honour.\r\n\r\n"In the place to which I am going," I told my friends, "I am not likely\r\nto find evenings like this, and, to while away the long hours of\r\ndarkness, I shall make a novel out of your story."\r\n\r\n"In that case," said the nephew, "let me give you my uncle\'s journal,\r\nwhich, under the heading Parma, mentions several of the intrigues of\r\nthat court, in the days when the Duchessa\'s word was law there; but,\r\nhave a care! this story is anything but moral, and now that you pride\r\nyourselves in France on your gospel purity, it may win you the\r\nreputation of an _assassin_."\r\n\r\nI publish this tale without any alteration from the manuscript of 1830,\r\na course which may have two drawbacks:\r\n\r\nThe first for the reader: the characters being Italians will perhaps\r\ninterest him less, hearts in that country differing considerably from\r\nhearts in France: the Italians are sincere, honest folk and, not taking\r\noffence, say what is in their minds; it is only when the mood seizes\r\nthem that they shew any vanity; which then becomes passion, and goes by\r\nthe name of _puntiglio_. Lastly, poverty is not, with them, a subject\r\nfor ridicule.\r\n\r\nThe second drawback concerns the author.\r\n\r\nI confess that I have been so bold as to leave my characters with their\r\nnatural asperities; but, on the other hand--this I proclaim aloud--I\r\nheap the most moral censure upon many of their actions. To what purpose\r\nshould I give them the exalted morality and other graces of French\r\ncharacters, who love money above all things, and sin scarcely ever from\r\nmotives of hatred or love? The Italians in this tale are almost the\r\nopposite. Besides, it seems to me that, whenever one takes a stride of\r\ntwo hundred leagues from South to North, the change of scene that occurs\r\nis tantamount to a fresh tale. The Canon\'s charming niece had known and\r\nindeed had been greatly devoted to the Duchessa Sanseverina, and begs me\r\nto alter nothing in her adventures, which are reprehensible.\r\n\r\n\r\n23rd January, 1839.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHARTERHOUSE\r\nOF PARMA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of May, 1796, General Bonaparte made his entry into Milan at\r\nthe head of that young army which had shortly before crossed the Bridge\r\nof Lodi and taught the world that after all these centuries C\xc3\xa6sar and\r\nAlexander had a successor. The miracles of gallantry and genius of which\r\nItaly was a witness in the space of a few months aroused a slumbering\r\npeople; only a week before the arrival of the French, the Milanese still\r\nregarded them as a mere rabble of brigands, accustomed invariably to\r\nflee before the troops of His Imperial and Royal Majesty; so much at\r\nleast was reported to them three times weekly by a little news-sheet no\r\nbigger than one\'s hand, and printed on soiled paper.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages the Republicans of Lombardy had given proof of a\r\nvalour equal to that of the French, and deserved to see their city rased\r\nto the ground by the German Emperors. Since they had become _loyal\r\nsubjects_, their great occupation was the printing of sonnets upon\r\nhandkerchiefs of rose-coloured taffeta whenever the marriage occurred of\r\na young lady belonging to some rich or noble family. Two or three years\r\nafter that great event in her life, the young lady in question used to\r\nengage a devoted admirer: sometimes the name of the _cicisbeo_ chosen by\r\nthe husband\'s family occupied an honourable place in the marriage\r\ncontract. It was a far cry from these effeminate ways to the profound\r\nemotions aroused by the unexpected arrival of the French army. Presently\r\nthere sprang up a new and passionate way of life. A whole people\r\ndiscovered, on the 15th of May, 1796, that everything which until then\r\nit had respected was supremely ridiculous, if not actually hateful. The\r\ndeparture of the last Austrian regiment marked the collapse of the old\r\nideas: to risk one\'s life became the fashion. People saw that in order\r\nto be really happy after centuries of cloying sensations, it was\r\nnecessary to love one\'s country with a real love and to seek out heroic\r\nactions. They had been plunged in the darkest night by the continuation\r\nof the jealous despotism of Charles V and Philip II; they overturned\r\nthese monarchs\' statues and immediately found themselves flooded with\r\ndaylight. For the last half-century, as the _Encyclop\xc3\xa6dia_ and Voltaire\r\ngained ground in France, the monks had been dinning into the ears of the\r\ngood people of Milan that to learn to read, or for that matter to learn\r\nanything at all was a great waste of labour, and that by paying one\'s\r\nexact tithe to one\'s parish priest and faithfully reporting to him all\r\none\'s little misdeeds, one was practically certain of having a good\r\nplace in Paradise. To complete the debilitation of this people once so\r\nformidable and so rational, Austria had sold them, on easy terms, the\r\nprivilege of not having to furnish any recruits to her army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_MILAN IN 1796_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1796, the Milanese army was composed of four and twenty rapscallions\r\ndressed in scarlet, who guarded the town with the assistance of four\r\nmagnificent regiments of Hungarian Grenadiers. Freedom of morals was\r\nextreme, but passion very rare; otherwise, apart from the inconvenience\r\nof having to repeat everything to one\'s parish priest, on pain of ruin\r\neven in this world, the good people of Milan were still subjected to\r\ncertain little monarchical interferences which could not fail to be\r\nvexatious. For instance, the Archduke, who resided at Milan and governed\r\nin the name of the Emperor, his cousin, had had the lucrative idea of\r\ntrading in corn. In consequence, an order prohibiting the peasants from\r\nselling their grain until His Highness had filled his granaries.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1796, three days after the entry of the French, a young painter\r\nin miniature, slightly mad, named Gros, afterwards famous, who had come\r\nwith the army, overhearing in the great Caff\xc3\xa8 dei Servi (which was then\r\nin fashion) an account of the exploits of the Archduke, who moreover was\r\nextremely stout, picked up the list of ices which was printed on a sheet\r\nof coarse yellow paper. On the back of this he drew the fat Archduke; a\r\nFrench soldier was stabbing him with his bayonet in the stomach, and\r\ninstead of blood there gushed out an incredible quantity of corn. What\r\nwe call a lampoon or caricature was unknown in this land of crafty\r\ndespotism. The drawing, left by Gros on the table of the Caff\xc3\xa8 dei\r\nServi, seemed a miracle fallen from heaven; it was engraved and printed\r\nduring the night, and next day twenty thousand copies of it were sold.\r\n\r\nThe same day, there were posted up notices of a forced loan of six\r\nmillions, levied to supply the needs of the French army which, having\r\njust won six battles and conquered a score of provinces, wanted nothing\r\nnow but shoes, breeches, jackets and caps.\r\n\r\nThe mass of prosperity and pleasure which burst into Lombardy in the\r\nwake of these French ragamuffins was so great that only the priests and\r\na few nobles were conscious of the burden of this levy of six millions,\r\nshortly to be followed by a number of others. These French soldiers\r\nlaughed and sang all day long; they were all under twenty-five years of\r\nage, and their Commander in Chief, who had reached twenty-seven, was\r\nreckoned the oldest man in his army. This gaiety, this youthfulness,\r\nthis irresponsibility furnished a jocular reply to the furious\r\npreachings of the monks, who, for six months, had been announcing from\r\nthe pulpit that the French were monsters, obliged, upon pain of death,\r\nto burn down everything and to cut off everyone\'s head. With this\r\nobject, each of their regiments marched with a guillotine at its head.\r\n\r\nIn the country districts one saw at the cottage doors the French soldier\r\nengaged in dandling the housewife\'s baby in his arms, and almost every\r\nevening some drummer, scraping a fiddle, would improvise a ball. Our\r\ncountry dances proving a great deal too skilful and complicated for the\r\nsoldiers, who for that matter barely knew them themselves, to be able to\r\nteach them to the women of the country, it was the latter who shewed the\r\nyoung Frenchmen the _Monferrina_, _Salterello_ and other Italian dances.\r\n\r\nThe officers had been lodged, as far as possible, with the wealthy\r\ninhabitants; they had every need of comfort. A certain lieutenant, for\r\ninstance, named Robert, received a billeting order on the _palazzo_ of\r\nthe Marchesa del Dongo. This officer, a young conscript not\r\nover-burdened with scruples, possessed as his whole worldly wealth, when\r\nhe entered this _palazzo_, a scudo of six francs which he had received\r\nat Piacenza. After the crossing of the Bridge of Lodi he had taken from\r\na fine Austrian officer, killed by a ball, a magnificent pair of nankeen\r\npantaloons, quite new, and never did any garment come more opportunely.\r\nHis officer\'s epaulettes were of wool, and the cloth of his tunic was\r\nstitched to the lining of the sleeves so that its scraps might hold\r\ntogether; but there was something even more distressing; the soles of\r\nhis shoes were made out of pieces of soldiers\' caps, likewise picked up\r\non the field of battle, somewhere beyond the Bridge of Lodi. These\r\nmakeshift soles were tied on over his shoes with pieces of string which\r\nwere plainly visible, so that when the majordomo appeared at the door\r\nof Lieutenant Robert\'s room bringing him an invitation to dine with the\r\nSignora Marchesa, the officer was thrown into the utmost confusion. He\r\nand his orderly spent the two hours that divided him from this fatal\r\ndinner in trying to patch up the tunic a little and in dyeing black,\r\nwith ink, those wretched strings round his shoes. At last the dread\r\nmoment arrived. "Never in my life did I feel more ill at ease,"\r\nLieutenant Robert told me; "the ladies expected that I would terrify\r\nthem, and I was trembling far more than they were. I looked down at my\r\nshoes and did not know how to walk gracefully. The Marchesa del Dongo,"\r\nhe went on, "was then in the full bloom of her beauty: you have seen her\r\nfor yourself, with those lovely eyes of an angelic sweetness, and the\r\ndusky gold of her hair which made such a perfect frame for the oval of\r\nthat charming face. I had in my room a _Herodias_ by Leonardo da Vinci,\r\nwhich might have been her portrait. Mercifully, I was so overcome by her\r\nsupernatural beauty that I forgot all about my clothes. For the last two\r\nyears I had been seeing nothing that was not ugly and wretched, in the\r\nmountains behind Genoa: I ventured to say a few words to her to express\r\nmy delight.\r\n\r\n"But I had too much sense to waste any time upon compliments. As I was\r\nturning my phrases I saw, in a dining-room built entirely of marble, a\r\ndozen flunkeys and footmen dressed in what seemed to me then the height\r\nof magnificence. Just imagine, the rascals had not only good shoes on\r\ntheir feet, but silver buckles as well. I could see them all, out of the\r\ncorner of my eye, staring stupidly at my coat and perhaps at my shoes\r\nalso, which cut me to the heart. I could have frightened all these\r\nfellows with a word; but how was I to put them in their place without\r\nrunning the risk of offending the ladies? For the Marchesa, to fortify\r\nher own courage a little, as she has told me a hundred times since, had\r\nsent to fetch from the convent where she was still at school Gina del\r\nDongo, her husband\'s sister, who was afterwards that charming Contessa\r\nPietranera: no one, in prosperity, surpassed her in gaiety and sweetness\r\nof temper, just as no one surpassed her in courage and serenity of soul\r\nwhen fortune turned against her.\r\n\r\n"Gina, who at that time might have been thirteen but looked more like\r\neighteen, a lively, downright girl, as you know, was in such fear of\r\nbursting out laughing at the sight of my costume that she dared not eat;\r\nthe Marchesa, on the other hand, loaded me with constrained civilities;\r\nshe could see quite well the movements of impatience in my eyes. In a\r\nword, I cut a sorry figure, I chewed the bread of scorn, a thing which\r\nis said to be impossible for a Frenchman. At length, a heaven-sent idea\r\nshone in my mind: I set to work to tell the ladies of my poverty and of\r\nwhat we had suffered for the last two years in the mountains behind\r\nGenoa where we were kept by idiotic old Generals. There, I told them, we\r\nwere paid in _assignats_ which were not legal tender in the country, and\r\ngiven three ounces of bread daily. I had not been speaking for two\r\nminutes before there were tears in the good Marchesa\'s eyes, and Gina\r\nhad grown serious.\r\n\r\n"\'What, Lieutenant,\' she broke in, \'three ounces of bread!\'\r\n\r\n"\'Yes, Signorina; but to make up for that the issue ran short three days\r\nin the week, and as the peasants on whom we were billeted were even\r\nworse off than ourselves, we used to hand on some of our bread to them.\'\r\n\r\n"On leaving the table, I offered the Marchesa my arm as far as the door\r\nof the drawing-room, then hurried back and gave the servant who had\r\nwaited upon me at dinner that solitary scudo of six francs upon the\r\nspending of which I had built so many castles in the air.\r\n\r\n"A week later," Robert went on, "when it was satisfactorily established\r\nthat the French were not guillotining anyone, the Marchese del Dongo\r\nreturned from his castle of Grianta on the Lake of Como, to which he had\r\ngallantly retired on the approach of the army, abandoning to the\r\nfortunes of war his young and beautiful wife and his sister. The hatred\r\nthat this Marchese felt for us was equal to his fear, that is to say\r\nimmeasurable: his fat face, pale and pious, was an amusing spectacle\r\nwhen he was being polite to me. On the day after his return to Milan, I\r\nreceived three ells of cloth and two hundred francs out of the levy of\r\nsix millions; I renewed my wardrobe, and became cavalier to the ladies,\r\nfor the season of balls was beginning."\r\n\r\nLieutenant Robert\'s story was more or less that of all the French\r\ntroops; instead of laughing at the wretched plight of these poor\r\nsoldiers, people were sorry for them and came to love them.\r\n\r\nThis period of unlooked-for happiness and wild excitement lasted but two\r\nshort years; the frenzy had been so excessive and so general that it\r\nwould be impossible for me to give any idea of it, were it not for this\r\nhistorical and profound reflexion: these people had been living in a\r\nstate of boredom for the last hundred years.\r\n\r\nThe thirst for pleasure natural in southern countries had prevailed in\r\nformer times at the court of the Visconti and Sforza, those famous Dukes\r\nof Milan. But from the year 1524, when the Spaniards conquered the\r\nMilanese, and conquered them as taciturn, suspicious, arrogant masters,\r\nalways in dread of revolt, gaiety had fled. The subject race, adopting\r\nthe manners of their masters, thought more of avenging the least insult\r\nby a dagger-blow than of enjoying the fleeting hour.\r\n\r\nThis frenzied joy, this gaiety, this thirst for pleasure, this tendency\r\nto forget every sad or even reasonable feeling were carried to such a\r\npitch, between the 15th of May, 1796, when the French entered Milan, and\r\nApril, 1799, when they were driven out again after the battle of\r\nCassano, that instances have been cited of old millionaire merchants,\r\nold money-lenders, old scriveners who, during this interval, quite\r\nforgot to pull long faces and to amass money.\r\n\r\nAt the most it would have been possible to point to a few families\r\nbelonging to the higher ranks of the nobility, who had retired to their\r\npalaces in the country, as though in a sullen revolt against the\r\nprevailing high spirits and the expansion of every heart. It is true\r\nthat these noble and wealthy families had been given a distressing\r\nprominence in the allocation of the forced loans exacted for the French\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nThe Marchese del Dongo, irritated by the spectacle of so much gaiety,\r\nhad been one of the first to return to his magnificent castle of\r\nGrianta, on the farther side of Como, whither his ladies took with them\r\nLieutenant Robert. This castle, standing in a position which is perhaps\r\nunique in the world, on a plateau one hundred and fifty feet above that\r\nsublime lake, a great part of which it commands, had been originally a\r\nfortress. The del Dongo family had constructed it in the fifteenth\r\ncentury, as was everywhere attested by marble tablets charged with their\r\narms; one could still see the drawbridges and deep moats, though the\r\nlatter, it must be admitted, had been drained of their water; but with\r\nits walls eighty feet in height and six in thickness, this castle was\r\nsafe from assault, and it was for this reason that it was dear to the\r\ntimorous Marchese. Surrounded by some twenty-five or thirty retainers\r\nwhom he supposed to be devoted to his person, presumably because he\r\nnever opened his mouth except to curse them, he was less tormented by\r\nfear than at Milan.\r\n\r\nThis fear was not altogether groundless: he was in most active\r\ncorrespondence with a spy posted by Austria on the Swiss frontier three\r\nleagues from Grianta, to contrive the escape of the prisoners taken on\r\nthe field of battle; conduct which might have been viewed in a serious\r\nlight by the French Generals.\r\n\r\nThe Marchese had left his young wife at Milan; she looked after the\r\naffairs of the family there, and was responsible for providing the sums\r\nlevied on the _casa del Dongo_ (as they say in Italy); she sought to\r\nhave these reduced, which obliged her to visit those of the nobility who\r\nhad accepted public office, and even some highly influential persons who\r\nwere not of noble birth. A great event now occurred in this family. The\r\nMarchese had arranged the marriage of his young sister Gina with a\r\npersonage of great wealth and the very highest birth; but he powdered\r\nhis hair; in virtue of which, Gina received him with shouts of laughter,\r\nand presently took the rash step of marrying the Conte Pietranera. He\r\nwas, it is true, a very fine gentleman, of the most personable\r\nappearance, but ruined for generations past in estate, and to complete\r\nthe disgrace of the match, a fervent supporter of the new ideas.\r\nPietranera was a sub-lieutenant in the Italian Legion; this was the last\r\nstraw for the Marchese.\r\n\r\nAfter these two years of folly and happiness, the Directory in Paris,\r\ngiving itself the airs of a sovereign firmly enthroned, began to shew a\r\nmortal hatred of everything that was not commonplace. The incompetent\r\nGenerals whom it imposed on the Army of Italy lost a succession of\r\nbattles in those same plains of Verona, which had witnessed two years\r\nbefore the prodigies of Arcole and Lonato. The Austrians again drew near\r\nto Milan; Lieutenant Robert, who had been promoted to the command of a\r\nbattalion and had been wounded at the battle of Cassano, came to lodge\r\nfor the last time in the house of his friend the Marchesa del Dongo.\r\nTheir parting was a sad one; Robert set forth with Conte Pietranera who\r\nfollowed the French in their retirement on Novi. The young Contessa, to\r\nwhom her brother refused to pay her marriage portion, followed the army,\r\nriding in a cart.\r\n\r\nThen began that period of reaction and a return to the old ideas, which\r\nthe Milanese call _i tredici mesi_ (the thirteen months), because as it\r\nturned out their destiny willed that this return to stupidity should\r\nendure for thirteen months only, until Marengo. Everyone who was old,\r\nbigoted, morose, reappeared at the head of affairs, and resumed the\r\nleadership of society; presently the people who had remained faithful to\r\nthe sound doctrines published a report in the villages that Napoleon had\r\nbeen hanged by the Mamelukes in Egypt, as he so richly deserved.\r\n\r\nAmong these men who had retired to sulk on their estates and came back\r\nnow athirst for vengeance, the Marchese del Dongo distinguished himself\r\nby his rabidity; the extravagance of his sentiments carried him\r\nnaturally to the head of his party. These gentlemen, quite worthy people\r\nwhen they were not in a state of panic, but who were always trembling,\r\nsucceeded in getting round the Austrian General: a good enough man at\r\nheart, he let himself be persuaded that severity was the best policy,\r\nand ordered the arrest of one hundred and fifty patriots: quite the best\r\nmen to be found in Italy at the time.\r\n\r\nThey were speedily deported to the Bocche di Cattaro, and, flung into\r\nsubterranean caves, the moisture, and above all the want of bread did\r\nprompt justice to each and all of these rascals.\r\n\r\nThe Marchese del Dongo had an exalted position, and, as he combined with\r\na host of other fine qualities a sordid avarice, he would boast publicly\r\nthat he never sent a scudo to his sister, the Contessa Pietranera: still\r\nmadly in love, she refused to leave her husband, and was starving by his\r\nside in France. The good Marchesa was in despair; finally she managed to\r\nabstract a few small diamonds from her jewel case, which her husband\r\ntook from her every evening to stow away under his bed, in an iron\r\ncoffer: the Marchesa had brought him a dowry of 800,000 francs, and\r\nreceived 80 francs monthly for her personal expenses. During the\r\nthirteen months in which the French were absent from Milan, this most\r\ntimid of women found various pretexts and never went out of mourning.\r\n\r\nWe must confess that, following the example of many grave authors, we\r\nhave begun the history of our hero a year before his birth. This\r\nessential personage is none other than Fabrizio Valserra, Marchesino del\r\nDongo, as the style is at Milan.[6] He had taken the trouble to be born\r\njust when the French were driven out, and found himself, by the accident\r\nof birth, the second son of that Marchese del Dongo who was so great a\r\ngentleman, and with whose fat, pasty face, false smile and unbounded\r\nhatred for the new ideas the reader is already acquainted. The whole of\r\nthe family fortune was already settled upon the elder son, Ascanio del\r\nDongo, the worthy image of his father. He was eight years old and\r\nFabrizio two when all of a sudden that General Bonaparte, whom everyone\r\nof good family understood to have been hanged long ago, came down from\r\nthe Mont Saint-Bernard. He entered Milan: that moment is still unique in\r\nhistory; imagine a whole populace madly in love. A few days later,\r\nNapoleon won the battle of Marengo. The rest needs no telling. The\r\nfrenzy of the Milanese reached its climax; but this time it was mingled\r\nwith ideas of vengeance: these good people had been taught to hate.\r\nPresently they saw arrive in their midst all that remained of the\r\npatriots deported to the Bocche di Cattaro; their return was celebrated\r\nwith a national _festa_. Their pale faces, their great startled eyes,\r\ntheir shrunken limbs were in strange contrast to the joy that broke out\r\non every side. Their arrival was the signal for departure for the\r\nfamilies most deeply compromised. The Marchese del Dongo was one of the\r\nfirst to flee to his castle of Grianta. The heads of the great families\r\nwere filled with hatred and fear; but their wives, their daughters,\r\nremembered the joys of the former French occupation, and thought with\r\nregret of Milan and those gay balls, which, immediately after Marengo,\r\nwere organised afresh at the _casa Tanzi_. A few days after the victory,\r\nthe French General responsible for maintaining order in Lombardy\r\ndiscovered that all the farmers on the noblemen\'s estates, all the old\r\nwives in the villages, so far from still thinking of this astonishing\r\nvictory at Marengo, which had altered the destinies of Italy and\r\nrecaptured thirteen fortified positions in a single day, had their minds\r\noccupied only by a prophecy of San Giovita, the principal Patron Saint\r\nof Brescia. According to this inspired utterance, the prosperity of\r\nFrance and of Napoleon was to cease just thirteen weeks after Marengo.\r\nWhat does to some extent excuse the Marchese del Dongo and all the\r\nnobles sulking on their estates is that literally and without any\r\naffectation they believed in the prophecy. Not one of these gentlemen\r\nhad read as many as four volumes in his life; quite openly they were\r\nmaking their preparations to return to Milan at the end of the thirteen\r\nweeks; but time, as it went on, recorded fresh successes for the cause\r\nof France. Returning to Paris, Napoleon, by wise decrees, saved the\r\ncountry from revolution at home as he had saved it from its foreign\r\nenemies at Marengo. Then the Lombard nobles, in the safe shelter of\r\ntheir castles, discovered that at first they had misinterpreted the\r\nprophecy of the holy patron of Brescia; it was a question not of\r\nthirteen weeks, but of thirteen months. The thirteen months went by, and\r\nthe prosperity of France seemed to increase daily.\r\n\r\nWe pass lightly over ten years of progress and happiness, from 1800 to\r\n1810. Fabrizio spent the first part of this decade at the castle of\r\nGrianta, giving and receiving an abundance of fisticuffs among the\r\nlittle _contadini_ of the village, and learning nothing, not even how to\r\nread. Later on, he was sent to the Jesuit College at Milan. The\r\nMarchese, his father, insisted on his being shewn the Latin tongue, not\r\non any account in the works of those ancient writers who are always\r\ntalking about Republics, but in a magnificent volume adorned with more\r\nthan a hundred engravings, a masterpiece of seventeenth-century art;\r\nthis was the Lathi genealogy of the Valserra, Marchesi del Dongo,\r\npublished in 1650 by Fabrizio del Dongo, Archbishop of Parma. The\r\nfortunes of the Valserra being pre-eminently military, the engravings\r\nrepresented any number of battles, and everywhere one saw some hero of\r\nthe name dealing mighty blows with his sword. This book greatly\r\ndelighted the young Fabrizio. His mother, who adored him, obtained\r\npermission, from time to time, to pay him a visit at Milan; but as her\r\nhusband never offered her any money for these journeys, it was her\r\nsister-in-law, the charming Contessa Pietranera, who lent her what she\r\nrequired. After the return of the French, the Contessa had become one of\r\nthe most brilliant ladies at the court of Prince Eug\xc3\xa8ne, the Viceroy of\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nWhen Fabrizio had made his First Communion, she obtained leave from the\r\nMarchese, still in voluntary exile, to invite him out, now and again,\r\nfrom his college. She found him unusual, thoughtful, very serious, but a\r\nnice-looking boy and not at all out of place in the drawing-room of a\r\nlady of fashion; otherwise, as ignorant as one could wish, and barely\r\nable to write. The Contessa, who carried her impulsive character into\r\neverything, promised her protection to the head of the establishment\r\nprovided that her nephew Fabrizio made astounding progress and carried\r\noff a number of prizes at the end of the year. So that he should be in a\r\nposition to deserve them, she used to send for him every Saturday\r\nevening, and often did not restore him to his masters until the\r\nfollowing Wednesday or Thursday. The Jesuits, although tenderly\r\ncherished by the Prince Viceroy, were expelled from Italy by the laws of\r\nthe Kingdom, and the Superior of the College, an able man, was conscious\r\nof all that might be made out of his relations with a woman all-powerful\r\nat court. He never thought of complaining of the absences of Fabrizio,\r\nwho, more ignorant than ever, at the end of the year was awarded five\r\nfirst prizes. This being so, the Contessa, escorted by her husband, now\r\nthe General commanding one of the Divisions of the Guard, and by five or\r\nsix of the most important personages at the viceregal court, came to\r\nattend the prize-giving at the Jesuit College. The Superior was\r\ncomplimented by his chiefs.\r\n\r\nThe Contessa took her nephew with her to all those brilliant festivities\r\nwhich marked the too brief reign of the sociable Prince Eug\xc3\xa8ne. She had\r\non her own authority created him an officer of hussars, and Fabrizio,\r\nnow twelve years old, wore that uniform. One day the Contessa, enchanted\r\nby his handsome figure, besought the Prince to give him a post as page,\r\na request which implied that the del Dongo family was coming round. Next\r\nday she had need of all her credit to secure the Viceroy\'s kind consent\r\nnot to remember this request, which lacked only the consent of the\r\nprospective page\'s father, and this consent would have been emphatically\r\nrefused. After this act of folly, which made the sullen Marchese\r\nshudder, he found an excuse to recall young Fabrizio to Grianta. The\r\nContessa had a supreme contempt for her brother, she regarded him as a\r\nmelancholy fool, and one who would be troublesome if ever it lay in his\r\npower. But she was madly fond of Fabrizio, and, after ten years of\r\nsilence, wrote to the Marchese reclaiming her nephew; her letter was\r\nleft unanswered.\r\n\r\nOn his return to this formidable palace, built by the most bellicose of\r\nhis ancestors, Fabrizio knew nothing in the world except how to drill\r\nand how to sit on a horse. Conte Pietranera, as fond of the boy as was\r\nhis wife, used often to put him on a horse and take him with him on\r\nparade.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the castle of Grianta, Fabrizio, his eyes still red with the\r\ntears that he had shed on leaving his aunt\'s fine rooms, found only the\r\npassionate caresses of his mother and sisters. The Marchese was closeted\r\nin his study with his elder son, the Marchesino Ascanio; there they\r\ncomposed letters in cipher which had the honour to be forwarded to\r\nVienna; father and son appeared in public only at meal-times. The\r\nMarchese used ostentatiously to repeat that he was teaching his natural\r\nsuccessor to keep, by double entry, the accounts of the produce of each\r\nof his estates. As a matter of fact, the Marchese was too jealous of his\r\nown power ever to speak of these matters to a son, the necessary\r\ninheritor of all these entailed properties. He employed him to cipher\r\ndespatches of fifteen or twenty pages which two or three times weekly he\r\nhad conveyed into Switzerland, where they were put on the road for\r\nVienna. The Marchese claimed to inform his rightful Sovereign of the\r\ninternal condition of the Kingdom of Italy, of which he himself knew\r\nnothing, and his letters were invariably most successful, for the\r\nfollowing reason. The Marchese would have a count taken on the high\r\nroad, by some trusted agent, of the number of men in a certain French or\r\nItalian regiment that was changing its station, and in reporting the\r\nfact to the court of Vienna would take care to reduce by at least a\r\nquarter the number of the troops on the march. These letters, in other\r\nrespects absurd, had the merit of contradicting others of greater\r\naccuracy, and gave pleasure. And so, a short time before Fabrizio\'s\r\narrival at the castle, the Marchese had received the star of a famous\r\norder: it was the fifth to adorn his Chamberlain\'s coat. As a matter of\r\nfact, he suffered from the chagrin of not daring to sport this garment\r\noutside his study; but he never allowed himself to dictate a despatch\r\nwithout first putting on the gold-laced coat, studded with all his\r\norders. He would have felt himself to be wanting in respect had he acted\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nThe Marchesa was amazed by her son\'s graces. But she had kept up the\r\nhabit of writing two or three times every year to General Comte d\'A----,\r\nwhich was the title now borne by Lieutenant Robert. The Marchesa had a\r\nhorror of lying to the people to whom she was attached; she examined her\r\nson and was appalled by his ignorance.\r\n\r\n"If he appears to me to have learned little," she said to herself, "to\r\nme who know nothing, Robert, who is so clever, would find that his\r\neducation had been entirely neglected; and in these days one must have\r\nmerit." Another peculiarity, which astonished her almost as much, was\r\nthat Fabrizio had taken seriously all the religious teaching that had\r\nbeen instilled into him by the Jesuits. Although very pious herself, the\r\nfanaticism of this child made her shudder; "If the Marchese has the\r\nsense to discover this way of influencing him, he will take my son\'s\r\naffection from me." She wept copiously, and her passion for Fabrizio was\r\nthereby increased.\r\n\r\nLife in this castle, peopled by thirty or forty servants, was extremely\r\ndull; accordingly Fabrizio spent all his days in pursuit of game or\r\nexploring the lake in a boat. Soon he was on intimate terms with the\r\ncoachmen and grooms; these were all hot supporters of the French, and\r\nlaughed openly at the pious valets, attached to the person of the\r\nMarchese or to that of his elder son. The great theme for wit at the\r\nexpense of these solemn personages was that, in imitation of their\r\nmasters, they powdered their heads.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: By the local custom, borrowed from Germany, this title is\r\ngiven to every son of a Marchese; _Contino_ to the son of a Conte,\r\n_Contessina_ to the daughter of a Conte, etc.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . _Alors que Vesper vient embrunir nos\r\n   yeux,\r\nTout \xc3\xa9pris d\'avenir, je contemple les cieux,\r\nEn qui Dieu nous escrit, par notes non obscures.\r\nLes sorts et les destins de toutes cr\xc3\xa9atures.\r\nCar lui, du fond des deux regardant un\r\n   humain.\r\nParfois m\xc3\xbb de piti\xc3\xa9, lui montre le chemin;\r\nPar les astres du ciel qui sont ses caract\xc3\xa8res,\r\nLes choses nous pr\xc3\xa9dit et bonnes et contraires;\r\nMais les hommes charg\xc3\xa9s de terre et de tr\xc3\xa9pas,\r\nM\xc3\xa9prisent tel \xc3\xa9crit, et ne le lisent pas._\r\n\r\n                                     RONSARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Marchese professed a vigorous hatred of enlightenment: "It is\r\nideas," he used to say, "that have ruined Italy"; he did not know quite\r\nhow to reconcile this holy horror of instruction with his desire to see\r\nhis son Fabrizio perfect the education so brilliantly begun with the\r\nJesuits. In order to incur the least possible risk, he charged the good\r\nPriore Blan\xc3\xa8s, parish priest of Grianta, with the task of continuing\r\nFabrizio\'s Latin studies. For this it was necessary that the priest\r\nshould himself know that language; whereas it was to him an object of\r\nscorn; his knowledge in the matter being confined to the recitation, by\r\nheart, of the prayers in his missal, the meaning of which he could\r\ninterpret more or less to his flock. But this priest was nevertheless\r\nhighly respected and indeed feared throughout the district; he had\r\nalways said that it was by no means in thirteen weeks, nor even in\r\nthirteen months that they would see the fulfilment of the famous\r\nprophecy of San Giovita, the patron saint of Brescia. He added, when he\r\nwas speaking to friends whom he could trust, that this number _thirteen_\r\nwas to be interpreted in a fashion which would astonish many people, if\r\nit were permitted to say all that one knew (1813).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PRIORE BLAN\xc3\x88S_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact was that the Priore Blan\xc3\xa8s, a man whose honesty and virtue\r\nwere primitive, and a man of parts as well, spent all his nights up in\r\nhis belfry; he was mad on astrology. After using up all his days in\r\ncalculating the conjunctions and positions of the stars, he would devote\r\nthe greater part of his nights to following their course in the sky.\r\nSuch was his poverty, he had no other instrument than a long telescope\r\nwith pasteboard tubes. One may imagine the contempt that was felt for\r\nthe study of languages by a man who spent his time discovering the\r\nprecise dates of the fall of empires and the revolutions that change the\r\nface of the world. "What more do I know about a horse," he asked\r\nFabrizio, "when I am told that in Latin it is called _equus_?"\r\n\r\nThe _contadini_ looked upon Priore Blan\xc3\xa8s with awe as a great magician:\r\nfor his part, by dint of the fear that his nightly stations in the\r\nbelfry inspired, he restrained them from stealing. His clerical brethren\r\nin the surrounding parishes, intensely jealous of his influence,\r\ndetested him; the Marchese del Dongo merely despised him, because he\r\nreasoned too much for a man of such humble station. Fabrizio adored him:\r\nto gratify him he sometimes spent whole evenings in doing enormous sums\r\nof addition or multiplication. Then he would go up to the belfry: this\r\nwas a great favour and one that Priore Blan\xc3\xa8s had never granted to\r\nanyone; but he liked the boy for his simplicity. "If you do not turn out\r\na hypocrite," he would say to him, "you will perhaps be a man."\r\n\r\nTwo or three times in a year, Fabrizio, intrepid and passionate in his\r\npleasures, came within an inch of drowning himself in the lake. He was\r\nthe leader of all the great expeditions made by the young _contadini_ of\r\nGrianta and Cadenabbia. These boys had procured a number of little keys,\r\nand on very dark nights would try to open the padlocks of the chains\r\nthat fastened the boats to some big stone or to a tree growing by the\r\nwater\'s edge. It should be explained that on the Lake of Como the\r\nfishermen in the pursuit of their calling put out night-lines at a great\r\ndistance from the shore. The upper end of the line is attached to a\r\nplank kept afloat by a cork keel, and a supple hazel twig, fastened to\r\nthis plank, supports a little bell which rings whenever a fish, caught\r\non the line, gives a tug to the float.\r\n\r\nThe great object of these nocturnal expeditions, of which Fabrizio was\r\ncommander in chief, was to go out and visit the night-lines before the\r\nfishermen had heard the warning note of the little bells. They used to\r\nchoose stormy weather, and for these hazardous exploits would embark in\r\nthe early morning, an hour before dawn. As they climbed into the boat,\r\nthese boys imagined themselves to be plunging into the greatest dangers;\r\nthis was the finer aspect of their behaviour; and, following the example\r\nof their fathers, would devoutly repeat a _Hail, Mary_. Now it\r\nfrequently happened that at the moment of starting, and immediately\r\nafter the _Hail, Mary_, Fabrizio was struck by a foreboding. This was\r\nthe fruit which he had gathered from the astronomical studies of his\r\nfriend Priore Blan\xc3\xa8s, in whose predictions he had no faith whatsoever.\r\nAccording to his youthful imagination, this foreboding announced to him\r\ninfallibly the success or failure of the expedition; and, as he had a\r\nstronger will than any of his companions, in course of time the whole\r\nband had so formed the habit of having forebodings that if, at the\r\nmoment of embarking, one of them caught sight of a priest on the shore,\r\nor if someone saw a crow fly past on his left, they would hasten to\r\nreplace the padlock on the chain of the boat, and each would go off to\r\nhis bed. Thus Priore Blan\xc3\xa8s had not imparted his somewhat difficult\r\nscience to Fabrizio; but, unconsciously, had infected him with an\r\nunbounded confidence in the signs by which the future can be foretold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_MILAN_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Marchese felt that any accident to his ciphered correspondence might\r\nput him at the mercy of his sister; and so every year, at the feast of\r\nSant\'Angela, which was Contessa Pietranera\'s name-day, Fabrizio was\r\ngiven leave to go and spend a week at Milan. He lived through the year\r\nlooking hopefully forward or sadly back to this week. On this great\r\noccasion, to carry out this politic mission, the Marchese handed over to\r\nhis son four scudi, and, in accordance with his custom, gave nothing to\r\nhis wife, who took the boy. But one of the cooks, six lackeys and a\r\ncoachman with a pair of horses, started for Como the day before, and\r\nevery day at Milan the Marchesa found a carriage at her disposal and a\r\ndinner of twelve covers.\r\n\r\nThe sullen sort of life that was led by the Marchese del Dongo was\r\ncertainly by no means entertaining, but it had this advantage that it\r\npermanently enriched the families who were kind enough to sacrifice\r\nthemselves to it. The Marchese, who had an income of more than two\r\nhundred thousand lire, did not spend a quarter of that sum; he was\r\nliving on hope. Throughout the thirteen years from 1800 to 1813, he\r\nconstantly and firmly believed that Napoleon would be overthrown within\r\nsix months. One may judge of his rapture when, at the beginning of 1813,\r\nhe learned of the disasters of the Beresima! The taking of Paris and the\r\nfall of Napoleon almost made him lose his head; he then allowed himself\r\nto make the most outrageous remarks to his wife and sister. Finally,\r\nafter fourteen years of waiting, he had that unspeakable joy of seeing\r\nthe Austrian troops re-enter Milan. In obedience to orders issued from\r\nVienna, the Austrian General received the Marchese del Dongo with a\r\nconsideration akin to respect; they hastened to offer him one of the\r\nhighest posts in the government; and he accepted it as the payment of a\r\ndebt. His elder son obtained a lieutenancy in one of the smartest\r\nregiments of the Monarchy, but the younger repeatedly declined to accept\r\na cadetship which was offered him. This triumph, in which the Marchese\r\nexulted with a rare insolence, lasted but a few months, and was followed\r\nby a humiliating reverse. Never had he had any talent for business, and\r\nfourteen years spent in the country among his footmen, his lawyer and\r\nhis doctor, added to the crustiness of old age which had overtaken him,\r\nhad left him totally incapable of conducting business in any form. Now\r\nit is not possible, in an Austrian country, to keep an important place\r\nwithout having the kind of talent that is required by the slow and\r\ncomplicated, but highly reasonable administration of that venerable\r\nMonarchy. The blunders made by the Marchese del Dongo scandalised the\r\nstaff of his office, and even obstructed the course of public business.\r\nHis ultra-monarchist utterances irritated the populace which the\r\nauthorities sought to lull into a heedless slumber. One fine day he\r\nlearned that His Majesty had been graciously pleased to accept the\r\nresignation which he had submitted of his post in the administration,\r\nand at the same time conferred on him the place of _Second Grand\r\nMajordomo Major_ of the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom. The Marchese was\r\nfurious at the atrocious injustice of which he had been made a victim;\r\nhe printed an open letter to a friend, he who so inveighed against the\r\nliberty of the press. Finally, he wrote to the Emperor that his\r\nMinisters were playing him false, and were no better than Jacobins.\r\nThese things accomplished, he went sadly back to his castle of Grianta.\r\nHe had one consolation. After the fall of Napoleon, certain powerful\r\npersonages at Milan planned an assault in the streets on Conte Prina, a\r\nformer Minister of the King of Italy, and a man of the highest merit.\r\nConte Pietranera risked his own life to save that of the Minister, who\r\nwas killed by blows from umbrellas after five hours of agony. A priest,\r\nthe Marchese del Dongo\'s confessor, could have saved Prina by opening\r\nthe wicket of the church of San Giovanni, in front of which the\r\nunfortunate Minister was dragged, and indeed left for a moment in the\r\ngutter, in the middle of the street; but he refused with derision to\r\nopen his wicket, and, six months afterwards, the Marchese was happily\r\nable to secure for him a fine advancement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PRINA_\r\n\r\n\r\nHe execrated Conte Pietranera, his brother-in-law, who, not having an\r\nincome of 50 louis, had the audacity to be quite content, made a point\r\nof showing himself loyal to what he had loved all his life, and had the\r\ninsolence to preach that spirit of justice without regard for persons,\r\nwhich the Marchese called an infamous piece of Jacobinism. The Conte had\r\nrefused to take service in Austria; this refusal was remembered against\r\nhim, and, a few months after the death of Prina, the same persons who\r\nhad hired the assassins contrived that General Pietranera should be\r\nflung into prison. Whereupon the Contessa, his wife, procured a passport\r\nand sent for post-horses to go to Vienna to tell the Emperor the truth.\r\nPrina\'s assassins took fright, and one of them, a cousin of Signora\r\nPietranera, came to her at midnight, an hour before she was to start for\r\nVienna, with the order for her husband\'s release. Next day, the Austrian\r\nGeneral sent for Conte Pietranera, received him with every possible mark\r\nof distinction, and assured him that his pension as a retired officer\r\nwould be issued to him without delay and on the most liberal scale. The\r\ngallant General Bubna, a man of sound judgment and warm heart, seemed\r\nquite ashamed of the assassination of Prina and the Conte\'s\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nAfter this brief storm, allayed by the Contessa\'s firmness of character,\r\nthe couple lived, for better or worse, on the retired pay for which,\r\nthanks to General Bubna\'s recommendation, they were not long kept\r\nwaiting.\r\n\r\nFortunately, it so happened that, for the last five or six years, the\r\nContessa had been on the most friendly terms with a very rich young man,\r\nwho was also an intimate friend of the Conte, and never failed to place\r\nat their disposal the finest team of English horses to be seen in Milan\r\nat the time, his box in the theatre _alla Scala_ and his villa in the\r\ncountry. But the Conte had a sense of his own valour, he was full of\r\ngenerous impulses, he was easily carried away, and at such times allowed\r\nhimself to make imprudent speeches. One day when he was out shooting\r\nwith some young men, one of them, who had served under other flags than\r\nhis, began to belittle the courage of the soldiers of the Cisalpine\r\nRepublic. The Conte struck him, a fight at once followed, and the Conte,\r\nwho was without support, among all these young men, was killed. This\r\nspecies of duel gave rise to a great deal of talk, and the persons who\r\nhad been engaged in it took the precaution of going for a tour in\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\nThat absurd form of courage which is called resignation, the courage of\r\na fool who allows himself to be hanged without a word of protest, was\r\nnot at all in keeping with the Contessa\'s character. Furious at the\r\ndeath of her husband, she would have liked Limercati, the rich young\r\nman, her intimate friend, to be seized also by the desire to travel in\r\nSwitzerland, and there to shoot or otherwise assault the murderer of\r\nConte Pietranera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_MILAN_\r\n\r\n\r\nLimercati thought this plan the last word in absurdity, and the Contessa\r\ndiscovered that in herself contempt for him had killed her affection.\r\nShe multiplied her attentions to Limercati; she sought to rekindle his\r\nlove, and then to leave him stranded and so make him desperate. To\r\nrender this plan of vengeance intelligible to French readers, I should\r\nexplain that at Milan, in a land widely remote from our own, people are\r\nstill made desperate by love. The Contessa, who, in her widow\'s weeds,\r\neasily eclipsed any of her rivals, flirted with all the young men of\r\nrank and fashion, and one of these, Conte N----, who, from the first,\r\nhad said that he felt Limercati\'s good qualities to be rather heavy,\r\nrather starched for so spirited a woman, fell madly in love with her.\r\nShe wrote to Limercati:\r\n\r\n\r\n"Will you for once act like a man of spirit? Please to consider\r\nthat you have never known me.\r\n\r\n"I am, with a trace of contempt perhaps, your most humble servant,\r\n\r\n"GINA PIETRANERA."\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter reading this missive, Limercati set off for one of his country\r\nseats, his love rose to a climax, he became quite mad and spoke of\r\nblowing out his brains, an unheard-of thing in countries where hell is\r\nbelieved in. Within twenty-four hours of his arrival in the country, he\r\nhad written to the Contessa offering her his hand and his rent-roll of\r\n200,000 francs. She sent him back his letter, with its seal unbroken, by\r\nConte N----\'s groom. Whereupon Limercati spent three years on his\r\nestates, returning every other month to Milan, but without ever having\r\nthe courage to remain there, and boring all his friends with his\r\npassionate love for the Contessa and his detailed accounts of the\r\nfavours she had formerly bestowed on him. At first, he used to add that\r\nwith Conte N---- she was ruining herself, and that such a connexion was\r\ndegrading to her.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the matter was that the Contessa had no sort of love for\r\nConte N----, and she told him as much when she had made quite sure of\r\nLimercati\'s despair. The Conte, who was no novice, besought her upon no\r\naccount to divulge the sad truth which she had confided to him. "If you\r\nwill be so extremely indulgent," he added, "as to continue to receive me\r\nwith all the outward distinctions accorded to a reigning lover, I may\r\nperhaps be able to find a suitable position."\r\n\r\nAfter this heroic declaration the Contessa declined to avail herself any\r\nlonger either of Conte N----\'s horses or of his box. But for the last\r\nfifteen years she had been accustomed to the most fashionable style of\r\nliving; she had now to solve that difficult, or rather impossible\r\nproblem: how to live in Milan on a pension of 1,500 francs. She left her\r\n_palazzo_, took a pair of rooms on a fifth floor, dismissed all her\r\nservants, including even her own maid whose place she filled with a poor\r\nold woman to do the housework. This sacrifice was as a matter of fact\r\nless heroic and less painful than it appears to us; at Milan poverty is\r\nnot a thing to laugh at, and therefore does not present itself to\r\ntrembling souls as the worst of evils. After some months of this noble\r\npoverty, besieged by incessant letters from Limercati, and indeed from\r\nConte N---- who also wished to marry her, it came to pass that the\r\nMarchese del Dongo, miserly as a rule to the last degree, bethought\r\nhimself that his enemies might find a cause for triumph in his sister\'s\r\nplight. What! A del Dongo reduced to living upon the pension which the\r\ncourt of Vienna, of which he had so many grounds for complaint, grants\r\nto the widows of its Generals!\r\n\r\nHe wrote to inform her that an apartment and an allowance worthy of his\r\nsister awaited her at the castle of Grianta. The Contessa\'s volatile\r\nmind embraced with enthusiasm the idea of this new mode of life; it was\r\ntwenty years since she had lived in that venerable castle that rose\r\nmajestically from among its old chestnuts planted in the days of the\r\nSforza. "There," she told herself, "I shall find repose, and, at my age,\r\nis not that in itself happiness?" (Having reached one-and-thirty, she\r\nimagined that the time had come for her to retire.) "On that sublime\r\nlake by which I was born, there awaits me at last a happy and peaceful\r\nexistence."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE LAKE_\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot say whether she was mistaken, but one thing certain is that\r\nthis passionate soul, which had just refused so lightly the offer of two\r\nvast fortunes, brought happiness to the castle of Grianta. Her two\r\nnieces were wild with joy. "You have renewed the dear days of my youth,"\r\nthe Marchesa told her, as she took her in her arms; "before you came, I\r\nwas a hundred." The Contessa set out to revisit, with Fabrizio, all\r\nthose enchanting spots in the neighbourhood of Grianta, which travellers\r\nhave made so famous: the Villa Melzi on the other shore of the lake,\r\nopposite the castle, and commanding a fine view of it; higher up, the\r\nsacred wood of the Sfrondata, and the bold promontory which divides the\r\ntwo arms of the lake, that of Como, so voluptuous, and the other which\r\nruns towards Lecco, grimly severe: sublime and charming views which the\r\nmost famous site in the world, the Bay of Naples, may equal, but does\r\nnot surpass. It was with ecstasy that the Contessa recaptured the\r\nmemories of her earliest childhood and compared them with her present\r\nsensations. "The Lake of Como," she said to herself, "is not surrounded,\r\nlike the Lake of Geneva, by wide tracts of land enclosed and cultivated\r\naccording to the most approved methods, which suggest money and\r\nspeculation. Here, on every side, I see hills of irregular height\r\ncovered with clumps of trees that have grown there at random, which the\r\nhand of man has never yet spoiled and forced to _yield a return_.\r\nStanding among these admirably shaped hills which run down to the lake\r\nat such curious angles, I can preserve all the illusions of Tasso\'s and\r\nAriosto\'s descriptions. All is noble and tender, everything speaks of\r\nlove, nothing recalls the ugliness of civilisation. The villages halfway\r\nup their sides are hidden in tall trees, and above the tree-tops rises\r\nthe charming architecture of their picturesque belfries. If some little\r\nfield fifty yards across comes here and there to interrupt the clumps of\r\nchestnuts and wild cherries, the satisfied eye sees growing on it plants\r\nmore vigorous and happier than elsewhere. Beyond these hills, the crests\r\nof which offer one hermitages in all of which one would like to dwell,\r\nthe astonished eye perceives the peaks of the Alps, always covered in\r\nsnow, and their stern austerity recalls to one so much of the sorrows of\r\nlife as is necessary to enhance one\'s immediate pleasure. The\r\nimagination is touched by the distant sound of the bell of some little\r\nvillage hidden among the trees: these sounds borne across the waters\r\nwhich soften their tone, assume a tinge of gentle melancholy and\r\nresignation, and seem to be saying to man: \'Life is fleeting: do not\r\ntherefore show yourself so obdurate towards the happiness that is\r\noffered you, make haste to enjoy it.\'" The language of these enchanting\r\nspots, which have not their like in the world, restored to the Contessa\r\nthe heart of a girl of sixteen. She could not conceive how she could\r\nhave spent all these years without revisiting the lake. "Is it then to\r\nthe threshold of old age," she asked herself, "that our happiness takes\r\nflight?" She bought a boat which Fabrizio, the Marchesa and she\r\ndecorated with their own hands, having no money to spend on anything, in\r\nthe midst of this most luxurious establishment; since his disgrace the\r\nMarchese del Dongo had doubled his aristocratic state. For example, in\r\norder to reclaim ten yards of land from the lake, near the famous plane\r\navenue, in the direction of Cadenabbia, he had an embankment built the\r\nestimate for which ran to 80,000 francs. At the end of this embankment\r\nthere rose, from the plans of the famous Marchese Cagnola, a chapel\r\nbuilt entirely of huge blocks of granite, and in this chapel Marchesi,\r\nthe sculptor then in fashion at Milan, built him a tomb on which a\r\nnumber of bas-reliefs were intended to represent the gallant deeds of\r\nhis ancestors.\r\n\r\nFabrizio\'s elder brother, the Marchesino Ascanio, sought to join the\r\nladies in their excursions; but his aunt flung water over his powdered\r\nhair, and found some fresh dart every day with which to puncture his\r\nsolemnity. At length he delivered from the sight of his fat, pasty face\r\nthe merry troop who did not venture to laugh in his presence. They\r\nsupposed him to be the spy of the Marchese his father, and care had to\r\nbe taken in handling that stern despot, always in a furious temper since\r\nhis enforced retirement.\r\n\r\nAscanio swore to be avenged on Fabrizio.\r\n\r\nThere was a storm in which they were all in danger; although they were\r\ninfinitely short of money, they paid the two boatmen generously not to\r\nsay anything to the Marchese, who already was showing great ill humour\r\nat their taking his two daughters with them. They encountered a second\r\nstorm; the storms on this lake are terrible and unexpected: gusts of\r\nwind sweep out suddenly from the two mountain gorges which run down into\r\nit on opposite sides and join battle on the water. The Contessa wished\r\nto land in the midst of the hurricane and pealing thunder; she insisted\r\nthat, if she were to climb to a rock that stood up by itself in the\r\nmiddle of the lake and was the size of a small room, she would enjoy a\r\ncurious spectacle; she would see herself assailed on all sides by raging\r\nwaves; but in jumping out of the boat she fell into the water. Fabrizio\r\ndived in after her to save her, and both were carried away for some\r\ndistance. No doubt it is not a pleasant thing to feel oneself drowning;\r\nbut the spirit of boredom, taken by surprise, was banished from the\r\nfeudal castle. The Contessa conceived a passionate enthusiasm for the\r\nprimitive nature of the Priore Blan\xc3\xa8s and for his astrology. The little\r\nmoney that remained to her after the purchase of the boat had been spent\r\non buying a spy-glass, and almost every evening, with her nieces and\r\nFabrizio, she would take her stand on the platform of one of the gothic\r\ntowers of the castle. Fabrizio was the learned one of the party, and\r\nthey spent many hours there very pleasantly, out of reach of the spies.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that there were days on which the Contessa did not\r\nutter a word to anyone; she would be seen strolling under the tall\r\nchestnuts lost in sombre meditations; she was too clever a woman not to\r\nfeel at times the tedium of having no one with whom to exchange ideas.\r\nBut next day she would be laughing as before: it was the lamentations of\r\nher sister-in-law, the Marchesa, that produced these sombre impressions\r\non a mind naturally so active.\r\n\r\n"Are we to spend all the youth that is left to us in this gloomy\r\ncastle?" the Marchesa used to exclaim.\r\n\r\nBefore the Contessa came, she had not had the courage even to feel these\r\nregrets.\r\n\r\nSuch was their life during the winter of 1814 and 1815. On two\r\noccasions, in spite of her poverty, the Contessa went to spend a few\r\ndays at Milan; she was anxious to see a sublime ballet by Vigano, given\r\nat the Scala, and the Marchese raised no objections to his wife\'s\r\naccompanying her sister-in-law. They went to draw the arrears of the\r\nlittle pension, and it was the penniless widow of the Cisalpine General\r\nwho lent a few sequins to the millionaire Marchesa del Dongo. These\r\nparties were delightful; they invited old friends to dinner, and\r\nconsoled themselves by laughing at everything, just like children. This\r\nItalian gaiety, full of surprise and brio, made them forget the\r\natmosphere of sombre gloom which the stern faces of the Marchese and his\r\nelder son spread around them at Grianta. Fabrizio, though barely\r\nsixteen, represented the head of the house admirably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_DEPARTURE_\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of March, 1815, the ladies had been back for two days after a\r\ncharming little excursion to Milan; they were strolling under the fine\r\navenue of plane trees, then recently extended to the very edge of the\r\nlake. A boat appeared, coming from the direction of Como, and made\r\nstrange signals. One of the Marchese\'s agents leaped out upon the bank:\r\nNapoleon had just landed from the Gulf of Juan. Europe was kind enough\r\nto be surprised at this event, which did not at all surprise the\r\nMarchese del Dongo; he wrote his Sovereign a letter full of the most\r\ncordial effusion; he offered him his talents and several millions of\r\nmoney, and informed him once again that his Ministers were Jacobins and\r\nin league with the ringleaders in Paris.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of March, at six o\'clock in the morning, the Marchese,\r\nwearing all his orders, was making his elder son dictate to him the\r\ndraft of a third political despatch; he was solemnly occupied in\r\ntranscribing this in his fine and careful hand, upon paper that bore the\r\nSovereign\'s effigy as a watermark. At the same moment, Fabrizio was\r\nknocking at Contessa Pietranera\'s door.\r\n\r\n"I am off," he informed her, "I am going to join the Emperor who is also\r\nKing of Italy; he was such a good friend to your husband! I shall travel\r\nthrough Switzerland. Last night, at Menaggio, my friend Vasi, the dealer\r\nin barometers, gave me his passport; now you must give me a few\r\nnapoleons, for I have only a couple on me; but if necessary I shall go\r\non foot."\r\n\r\nThe Contessa wept with joy and grief. "Great Heavens! What can have put\r\nthat idea into your head?" she cried, seizing Fabrizio\'s hands in her\r\nown.\r\n\r\nShe rose and went to fetch from the linen-cupboard, where it was\r\ncarefully hidden, a little purse embroidered with pearls; it was all\r\nthat she possessed in the world.\r\n\r\n"Take it," she said to Fabrizio; "but, in heaven\'s name, do not let\r\nyourself be killed. What will your poor mother and I have left, if you\r\nare taken from us? As for Napoleon\'s succeeding, that, my poor boy, is\r\nimpossible; our gentlemen will certainly manage to destroy him. Did you\r\nnot hear, a week ago, at Milan the story of the twenty-three plots to\r\nassassinate him, all so carefully planned, from which it was only by a\r\nmiracle that he escaped? And at that time he was all-powerful. And you\r\nhave seen that it is not the will to destroy him that is lacking in our\r\nenemies; France ceased to count after he left it."\r\n\r\nIt was in a tone of the keenest emotion that the Contessa spoke to\r\nFabrizio of the fate in store for Napoleon. "In allowing you to go to\r\njoin him, I am sacrificing to him the dearest thing I have in the\r\nworld," she said. Fabrizio\'s eyes grew moist, he shed tears as he\r\nembraced the Contessa, but his determination to be off was never for a\r\nmoment shaken. He explained with effusion to this beloved friend all the\r\nreasons that had led to his decision, reasons which we take the liberty\r\nof finding highly attractive.\r\n\r\n"Yesterday evening, it wanted seven minutes to six, we were strolling,\r\nyou remember, by the shore of the lake along the plane avenue, below the\r\nCasa Sommariva, and we were facing the south. It was there that I first\r\nnoticed, in the distance, the boat that was coming from Como, bearing\r\nsuch great tidings. As I looked at this boat without thinking of the\r\nEmperor, and only envying the lot of those who are free to travel,\r\nsuddenly I felt myself seized by a profound emotion. The boat touched\r\nground, the agent said something in a low tone to my father, who changed\r\ncolour, and took us aside to announce the _terrible news_. I turned\r\ntowards the lake with no other object but to hide the tears of joy that\r\nwere flooding my eyes. Suddenly, at an immense height in the sky and on\r\nmy right hand side, I saw an eagle, the bird of Napoleon; he flew\r\nmajestically past making for Switzerland, and consequently for Paris.\r\n\'And I too,\' I said to myself at that moment, \'will fly across\r\nSwitzerland with the speed of an eagle, and will go to offer that great\r\nman a very little thing, but the only thing, after all, that I have to\r\noffer him, the support of my feeble arm. He wished to give us a country,\r\nand he loved my uncle.\' At that instant, while I was gazing at the\r\neagle, in some strange way my tears ceased to flow; and the proof that\r\nthis idea came from above is that at the same moment, without any\r\ndiscussion, I made up my mind to go, and saw how the journey might be\r\nmade. In the twinkling of an eye all the sorrows that, as you know, are\r\npoisoning my life, especially on Sundays, seemed to be swept away by a\r\nbreath from heaven. I saw that mighty figure of Italy raise herself from\r\nthe mire in which the Germans keep her plunged;[7] she stretched out her\r\nmangled arms still half loaded with chains towards her King and\r\nLiberator. \'And I,\' I said to myself, \'a son as yet unknown to fame of\r\nthat unhappy Mother, I shall go forth to die or to conquer with that man\r\nmarked out by destiny, who sought to cleanse us from the scorn that is\r\nheaped upon us by even the most enslaved and the vilest among the\r\ninhabitants of Europe.\'\r\n\r\n"You know," he added in a low tone drawing nearer to the Contessa, and\r\nfastening upon her a pair of eyes from which fire darted, "you know that\r\nyoung chestnut which my mother, in the winter in which I was born,\r\nplanted with her own hands beside the big spring in our forest, two\r\nleagues from here; before doing anything else I wanted to visit it. \'The\r\nspring is not far advanced,\' I said to myself, \'very well, if my tree is\r\nin leaf, that shall be a sign for me. I also must emerge from the state\r\nof torpor in which I am languishing in this cold and dreary castle.\' Do\r\nyou not feel that these old blackened walls, the symbols now as they\r\nwere once the instruments of despotism, are a perfect image of the\r\ndreariness of winter? They are to me what winter is to my tree.\r\n\r\n"Would you believe it, Gina? Yesterday evening at half past seven I came\r\nto my chestnut; it had leaves, pretty little leaves that were quite big\r\nalready! I kissed them, carefully so as not to hurt them. I turned the\r\nsoil reverently round the dear tree. At once filled with a fresh\r\nenthusiasm, I crossed the mountain; I came to Menaggio: I needed a\r\npassport to enter Switzerland. The time had flown, it was already one\r\no\'clock in the morning when I found myself at Vasi\'s door. I thought\r\nthat I should have to knock for a long time to arouse him, but he was\r\nsitting up with three of his friends. At the first word I uttered: \'You\r\nare going to join Napoleon\' he cried; and he fell on my neck. The others\r\ntoo embraced me with rapture. \'Why am I married?\' I heard one of them\r\nsay."\r\n\r\nSignora Pietranera had grown pensive. She felt that she must offer a few\r\nobjections. If Fabrizio had had the slightest experience of life, he\r\nwould have seen quite well that the Contessa herself did not believe in\r\nthe sound reasons which she hastened to urge on him. But, failing\r\nexperience, he had resolution; he did not condescend even to hear what\r\nthose reasons were. The Contessa presently came down to making him\r\npromise that at least he would inform his mother of his intention.\r\n\r\n"She will tell my sisters, and those women will betray me without\r\nknowing it!" cried Fabrizio with a sort of heroic grandeur.\r\n\r\n"You should speak more respectfully," said the Contessa, smiling through\r\nher tears, "of the sex that will make your fortune; for you will never\r\nappeal to men, you have too much fire for prosaic souls."\r\n\r\nThe Marchesa dissolved in tears on learning her son\'s strange plan; she\r\ncould not feel its heroism, and did everything in her power to keep him\r\nat home. When she was convinced that nothing in the world, except the\r\nwalls of a prison, could prevent him from starting, she handed over to\r\nhim the little money that she possessed; then she remembered that she\r\nhad also, the day before, received nine or ten small diamonds, worth\r\nperhaps ten thousand francs, which the Marchese had entrusted to her to\r\ntake to Milan to be set. Fabrizio\'s sisters came into their mother\'s\r\nroom while the Contessa was sewing these diamonds into our hero\'s\r\ntravelling coat; he handed the poor women back their humble napoleons.\r\nHis sisters were so enthusiastic over his plan, they kissed him with so\r\nclamorous a joy that he took in his hand the diamonds that had still to\r\nbe concealed and was for starting off there and then.\r\n\r\n"You will betray me without knowing it," he said to his sisters. "Since\r\nI have all this money, there is no need to take clothes; one can get\r\nthem anywhere." He embraced these dear ones and set off at once without\r\neven going back to his own room. He walked so fast, afraid of being\r\nfollowed by men on horseback, that before night he had entered Lugano.\r\nHe was now, thank heaven, in a Swiss town, and had no longer any fear of\r\nbeing waylaid on the lonely road by constables in his father\'s pay. From\r\nthis haven, he wrote him a fine letter, a boyish weakness which gave\r\nstrength and substance to the Marchese\'s anger. Fabrizio took the post,\r\ncrossed the Saint-Gothard; his progress was rapid, and he entered France\r\nby Pontarlier. The Emperor was in Paris. There Fabrizio\'s troubles\r\nbegan; he had started out with the firm intention of speaking to the\r\nEmperor: it had never occurred to him that this might be a difficult\r\nmatter. At Milan, ten times daily he used to see Prince Eug\xc3\xa8ne, and\r\ncould have spoken to him had he wished. In Paris, every morning he went\r\nto the courtyard of the Tuileries to watch the reviews held by Napoleon;\r\nbut never was he able to come near the Emperor. Our hero imagined all\r\nthe French to be profoundly disturbed, as he himself was, by the extreme\r\nperil in which their country lay. At table in the hotel in which he was\r\nstaying, he made no mystery about his plans; he found several young men\r\nwith charming manners, even more enthusiastic than himself, who, in a\r\nvery few days, did not fail to rob him of all the money that he\r\npossessed. Fortunately, out of pure modesty, he had said nothing of the\r\ndiamonds given him by his mother. On the morning when, after an orgy\r\novernight, he found that he had been decidedly robbed, he bought a fine\r\npair of horses, engaged as servant an old soldier, one of the dealer\'s\r\ngrooms, and, filled with contempt for the young men of Paris with their\r\nfine speeches, set out to join the army. He knew nothing except that it\r\nwas concentrated near Maubeuge. No sooner had he reached the frontier\r\nthan he felt that it would be absurd for him to stay in a house,\r\ntoasting himself before a good fire, when there were soldiers in bivouac\r\noutside. In spite of the remonstrances of his servant, who was not\r\nlacking in common sense, he rashly made his way to the bivouacs on the\r\nextreme frontier, on the road into Belgium. No sooner had he reached the\r\nfirst battalion that was resting by the side of the road than the\r\nsoldiers began to stare at the sight of this young civilian in whose\r\nappearance there was nothing that suggested uniform. Night was falling,\r\na cold wind blew. Fabrizio went up to a fire and offered to pay for\r\nhospitality. The soldiers looked at one another amazed more than\r\nanything at the idea of payment, and willingly made room for him by the\r\nfire. His servant constructed a shelter for him. But, an hour later, the\r\n_adjudant_ of the regiment happening to pass near the bivouac, the\r\nsoldiers went to report to him the arrival of this stranger speaking bad\r\nFrench. The _adjudant_ questioned Fabrizio, who spoke to him of his\r\nenthusiasm for the Emperor in an accent which aroused grave suspicion;\r\nwhereupon this under-officer requested our hero to go with him to the\r\nColonel, whose headquarters were in a neighbouring farm. Fabrizio\'s\r\nservant came up with the two horses. The sight of them seemed to make so\r\nforcible an impression upon the _adjudant_ that immediately he changed\r\nhis mind and began to interrogate the servant also. The latter, an old\r\nsoldier, guessing his questioner\'s plan of campaign from the first,\r\nspoke of the powerful protection which his master enjoyed, adding that\r\ncertainly they would not _bone_ his fine horses. At once a soldier called\r\nby the _adjudant_ put his hand on the servant\'s collar; another soldier\r\ntook charge of the horses, and, with an air of severity, the _adjudant_\r\nordered Fabrizio to follow him and not to answer back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE BIVOUAC_\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter making him cover a good league on foot, in the darkness rendered\r\napparently more intense by the fires of the bivouacs which lighted the\r\nhorizon on every side, the adjutant handed Fabrizio over to an officer\r\nof _gendarmerie_ who, with a grave air, asked for his papers. Fabrizio\r\nshowed his passport, which described him as a dealer in barometers\r\ntravelling with his wares.\r\n\r\n"What fools they are!" cried the officer; "this really is too much."\r\n\r\nHe put a number of questions to our hero who spoke of the Emperor and of\r\nLiberty in terms of the keenest enthusiasm; whereupon the officer of\r\n_gendarmerie_ went off in peals of laughter.\r\n\r\n"Gad! You\'re no good at telling a tale!" he cried. "It is a bit too much\r\nof a good thing their daring to send us young mugs like you!" And\r\ndespite all the protestations of Fabrizio, who was dying to explain that\r\nhe was not really a dealer in barometers, the officer sent him to the\r\nprison of B----, a small town in the neighbourhood where our hero\r\narrived at about three o\'clock in the morning, beside himself with rage\r\nand half dead with exhaustion.\r\n\r\nFabrizio, astonished at first, then furious, understanding absolutely\r\nnothing of what was happening to him, spent thirty-three long days in\r\nthis wretched prison; he wrote letter after letter to the town\r\ncommandant, and it was the gaoler\'s wife, a handsome Fleming of\r\nsix-and-thirty, who undertook to deliver them. But as she had no wish to\r\nsee so nice-looking a boy shot, and as moreover he paid well, she put\r\nall these letters without fail in the fire. Late in the evening, she\r\nwould deign to come in and listen to the prisoner\'s complaints; she had\r\ntold her husband that the young greenhorn had money, after which the\r\nprudent gaoler allowed her a free hand. She availed herself of this\r\nlicence and received several gold napoleons in return, for the\r\n_adjudant_ had taken only the horses, and the officer of _gendarmerie_\r\nhad confiscated nothing at all. One afternoon in the month of June,\r\nFabrizio heard a violent cannonade at some distance. So they were\r\nfighting at last! His heart leaped with impatience. He heard also a\r\ngreat deal of noise in the town; as a matter of fact a big movement of\r\ntroops was being effected; three divisions were passing through B----.\r\nWhen, about eleven o\'clock, the gaoler\'s wife came in to share his\r\ngriefs, Fabrizio was even more friendly than usual; then, seizing hold\r\nof her hands:\r\n\r\n"Get me out of here, I swear on my honour to return to prison as soon as\r\nthey have stopped fighting."\r\n\r\n"Stuff and nonsense! Have you the _quibus_?" He seemed worried; he did\r\nnot understand the word _quibus_. The gaoler\'s wife, noticing his\r\ndismay, decided that he must be in low water, and instead of talking in\r\ngold napoleons as she had intended talked now only in francs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_WAR_\r\n\r\n\r\n"Listen," she said to him, "if you can put down a hundred francs, I will\r\nplace a double napoleon on each eye of the corporal who comes to change\r\nthe guard during the night. He won\'t be able to see you breaking out of\r\nprison, and if his regiment is to march to-morrow he will accept."\r\n\r\nThe bargain was soon struck. The gaoler\'s wife even consented to hide\r\nFabrizio in her own room, from which he could more easily make his\r\nescape in the morning.\r\n\r\nNext day, before dawn, the woman who was quite moved said to Fabrizio:\r\n\r\n"My dear boy, you are still far too young for that dirty trade; take my\r\nadvice, don\'t go back to it."\r\n\r\n"What!" stammered Fabrizio, "is it a crime then to wish to defend one\'s\r\ncountry?"\r\n\r\n"Enough said. Always remember that I saved your life; your case was\r\nclear, you would have been shot. But don\'t say a word to anyone, or you\r\nwill lose my husband and me our job; and whatever you do, don\'t go about\r\nrepeating that silly tale about being a gentleman from Milan disguised\r\nas a dealer in barometers, it\'s too stupid. Listen to me now, I\'m going\r\nto give you the uniform of a hussar who died the other day in the\r\nprison; open your mouth as little as you possibly can; but if a serjeant\r\nor an officer asks you questions so that you have to answer, say that\r\nyou\'ve been lying ill in the house of a peasant who took you in out of\r\ncharity when you were shivering with fever in a ditch by the roadside.\r\nIf that does not satisfy them, you can add that you are going back to\r\nyour regiment. They may perhaps arrest you because of your accent; then\r\nsay that you were born in Piedmont, that you\'re a conscript who was left\r\nin France last year, and all that sort of thing."\r\n\r\nFor the first time, after thirty-three days of blind fury, Fabrizio\r\ngrasped the clue to all that had happened. They took him for a spy. He\r\nargued with the gaoler\'s wife, who, that morning, was most affectionate;\r\nand finally, while armed with a needle she was taking in the hussar\'s\r\nuniform to fit him, he told his whole story in so many words to the\r\nastonished woman. For an instant she believed him; he had so innocent an\r\nair, and looked so nice dressed as a hussar.\r\n\r\n"Since you have such a desire to fight," she said to him at length half\r\nconvinced, "what you ought to have done as soon as you reached Paris was\r\nto enlist in a regiment. If you had paid for a serjeant\'s drink, the\r\nwhole thing would have been settled." The gaoler\'s wife added much good\r\nadvice for the future, and finally, at the first streak of dawn, let\r\nFabrizio out of the house, after making him swear a hundred times over\r\nthat he would never mention her name, whatever happened. As soon as\r\nFabrizio had left the little town, marching boldly with the hussar\'s\r\nsabre under his arm, he was seized by a scruple. "Here I am," he said to\r\nhimself, "with the clothes and the marching orders of a hussar who died\r\nin prison, where he was sent, they say, for stealing a cow and some\r\nsilver plate! I have, so to speak, inherited his identity . . . and\r\nwithout wishing it or expecting it in any way! Beware of prison! The\r\nomen is clear, I shall have much to suffer from prisons!"\r\n\r\nNot an hour had passed since Fabrizio\'s parting from his benefactress\r\nwhen the rain began to fall with such violence that the new hussar was\r\nbarely able to get along, hampered by a pair of heavy boots which had\r\nnot been made for him. Meeting a peasant mounted upon a sorry horse, he\r\nbought the animal, explaining by signs what he wanted; the gaoler\'s wife\r\nhad recommended him to speak as little as possible, in view of his\r\naccent.\r\n\r\nThat day the army, which had just won the battle of Ligny, was marching\r\nstraight on Brussels. It was the eve of the battle of Waterloo. Towards\r\nmidday, the rain still continuing to fall in torrents, Fabrizio heard\r\nthe sound of the guns; this joy made him completely oblivious of the\r\nfearful moments of despair in which so unjust an imprisonment had\r\nplunged him. He rode on until late at night, and, as he was beginning to\r\nhave a little common sense, went to seek shelter in a peasant\'s house a\r\nlong way from the road. This peasant wept and pretended that everything\r\nhad been taken from him; Fabrizio gave him a crown, and he found some\r\nbarley. "My horse is no beauty," Fabrizio said to himself, "but that\r\nmakes no difference, he may easily take the fancy of some _adjudant_,"\r\nand he went to lie down in the stable by its side. An hour before dawn\r\nFabrizio was on the road, and, by copious endearments, succeeded in\r\nmaking his horse trot. About five o\'clock, he heard the cannonade: it\r\nwas the preliminaries of Waterloo.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The speaker is carried away by passion; he is rendering\r\nin prose some lines of the famous Monti.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE\r\n\r\n\r\nFabrizio soon came upon some _vivandi\xc3\xa8res_, and the extreme gratitude\r\nthat he felt for the gaoler\'s wife of B---- impelled him to address\r\nthem; he asked one of them where he would find the 4th Hussar Regiment,\r\nto which he belonged.\r\n\r\n"You would do just as well not to be in such a hurry, young soldier,"\r\nsaid the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_, touched by Fabrizio\'s pallor and glowing eyes.\r\n"Your wrist is not strong enough yet for the sabre-thrusts they\'ll be\r\ngiving to-day. If you had a musket, I don\'t say, maybe you could let off\r\nyour round as well as any of them."\r\n\r\nThis advice displeased Fabrizio; but however much he urged on his horse,\r\nhe could go no faster than the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_ in her cart. Every now and\r\nthen the sound of the guns seemed to come nearer and prevented them from\r\nhearing each other speak, for Fabrizio was so beside himself with\r\nenthusiasm and delight that he had renewed the conversation. Every word\r\nuttered by the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_ intensified his happiness by making him\r\nunderstand it. With the exception of his real name and his escape from\r\nprison, he ended by confiding everything to this woman who seemed such a\r\ngood soul. She was greatly surprised and understood nothing at all of\r\nwhat this handsome young soldier was telling her.\r\n\r\n"I see what it is," she exclaimed at length with an air of triumph.\r\n"You\'re a young gentleman who has fallen in love with the wife of some\r\ncaptain in the 4th Hussars. Your mistress will have made you a present\r\nof the uniform you\'re wearing, and you\'re going after her. As sure as\r\nGod\'s in heaven, you\'ve never been a soldier; but, like the brave boy\r\nyou are, seeing your regiment\'s under fire, you want to be there too,\r\nand not let them think you a chicken."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_WAR_\r\n\r\n\r\nFabrizio agreed with everything; it was his only way of procuring good\r\nadvice. "I know nothing of the ways of these French people," he said to\r\nhimself, "and if I am not guided by someone I shall find myself being\r\nput in prison again, and they\'ll steal my horse."\r\n\r\n"First of all, my boy," said the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_, who was becoming more\r\nand more of a friend to him, "confess that you\'re not one-and-twenty: at\r\nthe very most you might be seventeen."\r\n\r\nThis was the truth, and Fabrizio admitted as much with good grace.\r\n\r\n"Then, you aren\'t even a conscript; it\'s simply because of Madame\'s\r\npretty face that you\'re going to get your bones broken. Plague it, she\r\ncan\'t be particular. If you\'ve still got some of the _yellow-boys_ she\r\nsent you, you must first of all buy yourself another horse; look how\r\nyour screw pricks up his ears when the guns sound at all near; that\'s a\r\npeasant\'s horse, and will be the death of you as soon as you reach the\r\nline. That white smoke you see over there above the hedge, that\'s the\r\ninfantry firing, my boy. So prepare for a fine fright when you hear the\r\nbullets whistling over you. You\'ll do as well to eat a bit while there\'s\r\nstill time."\r\n\r\nFabrizio followed this advice and, presenting a napoleon to the\r\n_vivandi\xc3\xa8re_, asked her to accept payment.\r\n\r\n"It makes one weep to see him!" cried the woman; "the poor child doesn\'t\r\neven know how to spend his money! It would be no more than you deserve\r\nif I pocketed your napoleon and put Cocotte into a trot; damned if your\r\nscrew could catch me up. What would you do, stupid, if you saw me go\r\noff? Bear in mind, when the _brute_ growls, never to show your gold.\r\nHere," she went on, "here\'s 18 francs, 50 centimes, and your breakfast\r\ncosts you 30 sous. Now, we shall soon have some horses for sale. If the\r\nbeast is a small one, you\'ll give ten francs, and, in any case, never\r\nmore than twenty, not if it was the horse of the Four Sons of Aymon."\r\n\r\nThe meal finished, the _vivandi\xc3\xa8re_, who was still haranguing, was\r\ninterrupted by a woman who had come across the fields and passed them on\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\n"Hallo there, hi!" this woman shouted. "Hallo, Margot! Your 6th Light\r\nare over there on the right."\r\n\r\n"I must leave you, my boy," said the _vivandi\xc3\xa8re_ to our hero; "but\r\nreally and truly I pity you; I\'ve taken quite a fancy to you, upon my\r\nword I have. You don\'t know a thing about anything, you\'re going to get\r\na wipe in the eye, as sure as God\'s in heaven! Come along to the 6th\r\nLight with me."\r\n\r\n"I quite understand that I know nothing," Fabrizio told her, "but I want\r\nto fight, and I\'m determined to go over there towards that white smoke."\r\n\r\n"Look how your horse is twitching his ears! As soon as he gets over\r\nthere, even if he\'s no strength left, he\'ll take the bit in his teeth\r\nand start galloping, and heaven only knows where he\'ll land you. Will\r\nyou listen to me now? As soon as you get to the troops, pick up a musket\r\nand a cartridge-pouch, get down among the men and copy what you see them\r\ndo, exactly the same: But, good heavens, I\'ll bet you don\'t even know\r\nhow to open a cartridge."\r\n\r\nFabrizio, stung to the quick, admitted nevertheless to his new friend\r\nthat she had guessed aright.\r\n\r\n"Poor boy! He\'ll be killed straight away; sure as God! It won\'t take\r\nlong. You\'ve got to come with me, absolutely," went on the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_\r\nin a tone of authority.\r\n\r\n"But I want to fight."\r\n\r\n"You shall fight too; why, the 6th Light are famous fighters, and\r\nthere\'s fighting enough to-day for everyone."\r\n\r\n"But shall we come soon to the regiment?"\r\n\r\n"In a quarter of an hour at the most."\r\n\r\n"With this honest woman\'s recommendation," Fabrizio told himself, "my\r\nignorance of everything won\'t make them take me for a spy, and I shall\r\nhave a chance of fighting." At this moment the noise of the guns\r\nredoubled, each explosion coming straight on top of the last. "It\'s like\r\na Rosary," said Fabrizio.\r\n\r\n"We\'re beginning to hear the infantry fire now," said the _vivandi\xc3\xa8re_,\r\nwhipping up her little horse, which seemed quite excited by the firing.\r\n\r\nThe _cantini\xc3\xa8re_ turned to the right and took a side road that ran\r\nthrough the fields; there was a foot of mud in it; the little cart\r\nseemed about to be stuck fast: Fabrizio pushed the wheel. His horse fell\r\ntwice; presently the road, though with less water on it, was nothing\r\nmore than a bridle path through the grass. Fabrizio had not gone five\r\nhundred yards when his nag stopped short: it was a corpse, lying across\r\nthe path, which terrified horse and rider alike.\r\n\r\nFabrizio\'s face, pale enough by nature, assumed a markedly green tinge;\r\nthe _cantini\xc3\xa8re_, after looking at the dead man, said, as though speaking\r\nto herself: "That\'s not one of our Division." Then, raising her eyes to\r\nour hero, she burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n"Aha, my boy! There\'s a titbit for you!" Fabrizio sat frozen. What\r\nstruck him most of all was the dirtiness of the feet of this corpse\r\nwhich had already been stripped of its shoes and left with nothing but\r\nan old pair of trousers all clotted with blood.\r\n\r\n"Come nearer," the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_ ordered him, "get off your horse,\r\nyou\'ll have to get accustomed to them; look," she cried, "he\'s stopped\r\none in the head."\r\n\r\nA bullet, entering on one side of the nose, had gone out at the opposite\r\ntemple, and disfigured the corpse in a hideous fashion. It lay with one\r\neye still open.\r\n\r\n"Get off your horse then, lad," said the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_, "and give him a\r\nshake of the hand to see if he\'ll return it."\r\n\r\nWithout hesitation, although ready to yield up his soul with disgust,\r\nFabrizio flung himself from his horse and took the hand of the corpse\r\nwhich he shook vigorously; then he stood still as though paralysed. He\r\nfelt that he had not the strength to mount again. What horrified him\r\nmore than anything was that open eye.\r\n\r\n"The _vivandi\xc3\xa8re_ will think me a coward," he said to himself bitterly.\r\nBut he felt the impossibility of making any movement; he would have\r\nfallen. It was a frightful moment; Fabrizio was on the point of being\r\nphysically sick. The _vivandi\xc3\xa8re_ noticed this, jumped lightly down\r\nfrom her little carriage, and held out to him, without saying a word, a\r\nglass of brandy which he swallowed at a gulp; he was able to mount his\r\nscrew, and continued on his way without speaking. The _vivandi\xc3\xa8re_\r\nlooked at him now and again from the corner of her eye.\r\n\r\n"You shall fight to-morrow, my boy," she said at length; "to-day you\'re\r\ngoing to stop with me. You can see now that you\'ve got to learn the\r\nbusiness before you can become a soldier."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, I want to start fighting at once," exclaimed our hero\r\nwith a sombre air which seemed to the _vivandi\xc3\xa8re_ to augur well. The\r\nnoise of the guns grew twice as loud and seemed to be coming nearer. The\r\nexplosions began to form a continuous bass; there was no interval\r\nbetween one and the next, and above this running bass, which suggested\r\nthe roar of a torrent in the distance, they could make out quite plainly\r\nthe rattle of musketry.\r\n\r\nAt this point the road dived down into a clump, of trees. The\r\n_vivandi\xc3\xa8re_ saw three or four soldiers of our army who were coming\r\ntowards her as fast as their legs would carry them; she jumped nimbly\r\ndown from her cart and ran into cover fifteen or twenty paces from the\r\nroad. She hid herself in a hole which had been left where a big tree had\r\nrecently been uprooted. "Now," thought Fabrizio, "we shall see whether I\r\nam a coward!" He stopped by the side of the little cart which the woman\r\nhad abandoned, and drew his sabre. The soldiers paid no attention to him\r\nand passed at a run along the wood, to the left of the road.\r\n\r\n"They\'re ours," said the _vivandi\xc3\xa8re_ calmly, as she came back, quite\r\nbreathless, to her little cart. . . . "If your horse was capable of\r\ngalloping, I should say: push ahead as far as the end of the wood, and\r\nsee if there\'s anyone on the plain." Fabrizio did not wait to be told\r\ntwice, he tore off a branch from a poplar, stripped it and started to\r\nlash his horse with all his might; the animal broke into a gallop for a\r\nmoment, then fell back into its regular slow trot. The _vivandi\xc3\xa8re_ had\r\nput her horse into a gallop. "Stop, will you, stop!" she called after\r\nFabrizio. Presently both were clear of the wood. Coming to the edge of\r\nthe plain, they heard a terrifying din, guns and muskets thundered on\r\nevery side, right, left, behind them. And as the clump of trees from\r\nwhich they emerged grew on a mound rising nine or ten feet above the\r\nplain, they could see fairly well a corner of the battle; but still\r\nthere was no one to be seen in the meadow beyond the wood. This meadow\r\nwas bordered, half a mile away, by a long row of willows, very bushy;\r\nabove the willows appeared a white smoke which now and again rose\r\neddying into the sky.\r\n\r\n"If I only knew where the regiment was," said the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_, in some\r\nembarrassment. "It won\'t do to go straight ahead over this big field. By\r\nthe way," she said to Fabrizio, "if you see one of the enemy, stick him\r\nwith the point of your sabre, don\'t play about with the blade."\r\n\r\nAt this moment, the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_ caught sight of the four soldiers whom\r\nwe mentioned a little way back; they were coming out of the wood on to\r\nthe plain to the left of the road. One of them was on horseback.\r\n\r\n"There you are," she said to Fabrizio. "Hallo there!" she called to the\r\nmounted man, "come over here and have a glass of brandy." The soldiers\r\napproached.\r\n\r\n"Where are the 6th Light?" she shouted.\r\n\r\n"Over there, five minutes away, across that canal that runs along by the\r\nwillows; why, Colonel Macon has just been killed."\r\n\r\n"Will you take five francs for your horse, you?"\r\n\r\n"Five francs! That\'s not a bad one, _ma_! An officer\'s horse I can sell\r\nin ten minutes for five napoleons."\r\n\r\n"Give me one of your napoleons," said the _vivandi\xc3\xa8re_ to Fabrizio.\r\nThen going up to the mounted soldier: "Get off, quickly," she said to\r\nhim, "here\'s your napoleon."\r\n\r\nThe soldier dismounted, Fabrizio sprang gaily on to the saddle, the\r\n_vivandi\xc3\xa8re_ unstrapped the little portmanteau which was on his old\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n"Come and help me, all of you!" she said to the soldiers, "is that the\r\nway you leave a lady to do the work?"\r\n\r\nBut no sooner had the captured horse felt the weight of the portmanteau\r\nthan he began to rear, and Fabrizio, who was an excellent horseman, had\r\nto use all his strength to hold him.\r\n\r\n"A good sign!" said the _vivandi\xc3\xa8re_, "the gentleman is not accustomed\r\nto being tickled by portmanteaus."\r\n\r\n"A general\'s horse," cried the man who had sold it, "a horse that\'s\r\nworth ten napoleons if it\'s worth a liard."\r\n\r\n"Here are twenty francs," said Fabrizio, who could not contain himself\r\nfor joy at feeling between his legs a horse that could really move.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a shot struck the line of willows, through which it\r\npassed obliquely, and Fabrizio had the curious spectacle of all those\r\nlittle branches flying this way and that as though mown down by a stroke\r\nof the scythe.\r\n\r\n"Look, there\'s the _brute_ advancing," the soldier said to him as he\r\ntook the twenty francs. It was now about two o\'clock.\r\n\r\nFabrizio was still under the spell of this strange spectacle when a\r\nparty of generals, followed by a score of hussars, passed at a gallop\r\nacross one corner of the huge field on the edge of which he had halted:\r\nhis horse neighed, reared several times in succession, then began\r\nviolently tugging the bridle that was holding him. "All right, then,"\r\nFabrizio said to himself.\r\n\r\nThe horse, left to his own devices, dashed off hell for leather to join\r\nthe escort that was following the generals. Fabrizio counted four\r\ngold-laced hats. A quarter of an hour later, from a few words said by\r\none hussar to the next, Fabrizio gathered that one of these generals was\r\nthe famous Marshal Ney. His happiness knew no bounds; only he had no way\r\nof telling which of the four generals was Marshal Ney; he would have\r\ngiven everything in the world to know, but he remembered that he had\r\nbeen told not to speak. The escort halted, having to cross a wide ditch\r\nleft full of water by the rain overnight; it was fringed with tall trees\r\nand formed the left hand boundary of the field at the entrance to which\r\nFabrizio had bought the horse. Almost all the hussars had dismounted;\r\nthe bank of the ditch was steep and very slippery and the water lay\r\nquite three or four feet below the level of the field. Fabrizio,\r\ndistracted with joy, was thinking more of Marshal Ney and of glory than\r\nof his horse, which, being highly excited, jumped into the canal, thus\r\nsplashing the water up to a considerable height. One of the generals was\r\nsoaked to the skin by the sheet of water, and cried with an oath: "Damn\r\nthe f---- brute!" Fabrizio felt deeply hurt by this insult. "Can I ask\r\nhim to apologise?" he wondered. Meanwhile, to prove that he was not so\r\nclumsy after all, he set his horse to climb the opposite bank of the\r\nditch; but it rose straight up and was five or six feet high. He had to\r\nabandon the attempt; then he rode up stream, his horse being up to its\r\nhead in water, and at last found a sort of drinking-place. By this\r\ngentle slope he was easily able to reach the field on the other side of\r\nthe canal. He was the first man of the escort to appear there; he\r\nstarted to trot proudly down the bank; below him, in the canal, the\r\nhussars were splashing about, somewhat embarrassed by their position,\r\nfor in many places the water was five feet deep. Two or three horses\r\ntook fright and began to swim, making an appalling mess. A serjeant\r\nnoticed the man\xc5\x93uvre that this youngster, who looked so very unlike a\r\nsoldier, had just carried out.\r\n\r\n"Up here! There is a watering-place on the left!" he shouted, and in\r\ntime they all crossed.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the farther bank, Fabrizio had found the generals there by\r\nthemselves; the noise of the guns seemed to him to have doubled; and it\r\nwas all he could do to hear the general whom he had given such a good\r\nsoaking and who now shouted in his ear:\r\n\r\n"Where did you get that horse?"\r\n\r\nFabrizio was so much upset that he answered in Italian:\r\n\r\n"_L\'ho comprato poco fa._ (I bought it just now.)"\r\n\r\n"What\'s that you say?" cried the general.\r\n\r\nBut the din at that moment became so terrific that Fabrizio could not\r\nanswer him. We must admit that our hero was very little of a hero at\r\nthat moment. However, fear came to him only as a secondary\r\nconsideration; he was principally shocked by the noise, which hurt his\r\nears. The escort broke into a gallop; they crossed a large batch of\r\ntilled land which lay beyond the canal. And this field was strewn with\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n"Red-coats! red-coats!" the hussars of the escort exclaimed joyfully,\r\nand at first Fabrizio did not understand; then he noticed that as a\r\nmatter of fact almost all these bodies wore red uniforms. One detail\r\nmade him shudder with horror; he observed that many of these unfortunate\r\nred-coats were still alive; they were calling out, evidently asking for\r\nhelp, and no one stopped to give it them. Our hero, being most humane,\r\ntook every possible care that his horse should not tread upon any of the\r\nred-coats. The escort halted; Fabrizio, who was not paying sufficient\r\nattention to his military duty, galloped on, his eyes fixed on a wounded\r\nwretch in front of him.\r\n\r\n"Will you halt, you young fool!" the serjeant shouted after him.\r\nFabrizio discovered that he was twenty paces on the generals\' right\r\nfront, and precisely in the direction in which they were gazing through\r\ntheir glasses. As he came back to take his place behind the other\r\nhussars, who had halted a few paces in rear of them, he noticed the\r\nbiggest of these generals who was speaking to his neighbour, a general\r\nalso, in a tone of authority and almost of reprimand; he was swearing.\r\nFabrizio could not contain his curiosity; and, in spite of the warning\r\nnot to speak, given him by his friend the gaoler\'s wife, he composed a\r\nshort sentence in good French, quite correct, and said to his neighbour:\r\n\r\n"Who is that general who is chewing up the one next to him?"\r\n\r\n"Gad, it\'s the Marshal!"\r\n\r\n"What Marshal?"\r\n\r\n"Marshal Ney, you fool! I say, where have you been serving?"\r\n\r\nFabrizio, although highly susceptible, had no thought of resenting this\r\ninsult; he was studying, lost in childish admiration, the famous Prince\r\nde la Moskowa, the "Bravest of the Brave."\r\n\r\nSuddenly they all moved off at full gallop. A few minutes later Fabrizio\r\nsaw, twenty paces ahead of him, a ploughed field the surface of which\r\nwas moving in a singular fashion. The furrows were full of water and the\r\nsoil, very damp, which formed the ridges between these furrows kept\r\nflying off in little black lumps three or four feet into the air.\r\nFabrizio noticed as he passed this curious effect; then his thoughts\r\nturned to dreaming of the Marshal and his glory. He heard a sharp cry\r\nclose to him; two hussars fell struck by shot; and, when he looked back\r\nat them, they were already twenty paces behind the escort. What seemed\r\nto him horrible was a horse streaming with blood that was struggling on\r\nthe ploughed land, its hooves caught in its own entrails; it was trying\r\nto follow the others: its blood ran down into the mire.\r\n\r\n"Ah! So I am under fire at last!" he said to himself. "I have seen shots\r\nfired!" he repeated with a sense of satisfaction. "Now I am a real\r\nsoldier." At that moment, the escort began to go hell for leather, and\r\nour hero realised that it was shot from the guns that was making the\r\nearth fly up all round him. He looked vainly in the direction from which\r\nthe balls were coming, he saw the white smoke of the battery at an\r\nenormous distance, and, in the thick of the steady and continuous rumble\r\nproduced by the artillery fire, he seemed to hear shots discharged much\r\ncloser at hand: he could not understand in the least what was happening.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, the generals and their escort dropped into a little road\r\nfilled with water which ran five feet below the level of the fields.\r\n\r\nThe Marshal halted and looked again through his glasses. Fabrizio, this\r\ntime, could examine him at his leisure. He found him to be very fair,\r\nwith a big red face. "We don\'t have any faces like that in Italy," he\r\nsaid to himself. "With my pale cheeks and chestnut hair, I shall never\r\nlook like that," he added despondently. To him these words implied: "I\r\nshall never be a hero." He looked at the hussars; with a solitary\r\nexception, all of them had yellow moustaches. If Fabrizio was studying\r\nthe hussars of the escort, they were all studying him as well. Their\r\nstare made him blush, and, to get rid of his embarrassment, he turned\r\nhis head towards the enemy. They consisted of widely extended lines of\r\nmen in red, but, what greatly surprised him, these men seemed to be\r\nquite minute. Their long files, which were regiments or divisions,\r\nappeared no taller than hedges. A line of red cavalry were trotting in\r\nthe direction of the sunken road along which the Marshal and his escort\r\nhad begun to move at a walk, splashing through the mud. The smoke made\r\nit impossible to distinguish anything in the direction in which they\r\nwere advancing; now and then one saw men moving at a gallop against this\r\nbackground of white smoke.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, from the direction of the enemy, Fabrizio saw four men\r\napproaching hell for leather. "Ah! We are attacked," he said to himself;\r\nthen he saw two of these men speak to the Marshal. One of the generals\r\non the latter\'s staff set off at a gallop towards the enemy, followed by\r\ntwo hussars of the escort and by the four men who had just come up.\r\nAfter a little canal which they all crossed, Fabrizio found himself\r\nriding beside a serjeant who seemed a good-natured fellow. "I must speak\r\nto this one," he said to himself, "then perhaps they\'ll stop staring at\r\nme." He thought for a long time.\r\n\r\n"Sir, this is the first time that I have been present at a battle," he\r\nsaid at length to the serjeant. "But is this a real battle?"\r\n\r\n"Something like. But who are you?"\r\n\r\n"I am the brother of a captain\'s wife."\r\n\r\n"And what is he called, your captain?"\r\n\r\nOur hero was terribly embarrassed; he had never anticipated this\r\nquestion. Fortunately, the Marshal and his escort broke into a gallop.\r\n"What French name shall I say?" he wondered. At last he remembered the\r\nname of the innkeeper with whom he had lodged in Paris; he brought his\r\nhorse up to the serjeant\'s, and shouted to him at the top of his voice:\r\n\r\n"Captain Meunier!" The other, not hearing properly in the roar of the\r\nguns, replied: "Oh, Captain Teulier? Well, he\'s been killed."\r\n"Splendid," thought Fabrizio. "Captain Teulier; I must look sad."\r\n\r\n"Good God!" he cried; and assumed a piteous mien. They had left the\r\nsunken road and were crossing a small meadow, they were going hell for\r\nleather, shots were coming over again, the Marshal headed for a division\r\nof cavalry. The escort found themselves surrounded by dead and wounded\r\nmen; but this sight had already ceased to make any impression on our\r\nhero; he had other things to think of.\r\n\r\nWhile the escort was halted, he caught sight of the little cart of a\r\n_cantini\xc3\xa8re_, and his affection for this honourable corps sweeping\r\naside every other consideration, set off at a gallop to join her.\r\n\r\n"Stay where you are, curse you," the serjeant shouted after him.\r\n\r\n"What can he do to me here?" thought Fabrizio, and he continued to\r\ngallop towards the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_. When he put spurs to his horse, he had\r\nhad some hope that it might be his good _cantini\xc3\xa8re_ of the morning;\r\nthe horse and the little cart bore a strong resemblance, but their owner\r\nwas quite different, and our hero thought her appearance most\r\nforbidding. As he came up to her, Fabrizio heard her say: "And he was\r\nsuch a fine looking man, too!" A very ugly sight awaited the new\r\nrecruit; they were sawing off a cuirassier\'s leg at the thigh, a\r\nhandsome young fellow of five feet ten. Fabrizio shut his eyes and drank\r\nfour glasses of brandy straight off.\r\n\r\n"How you do go for it, you boozer!" cried the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_. The brandy\r\ngave him an idea: "I must buy the goodwill of my comrades, the hussars\r\nof the escort."\r\n\r\n"Give me the rest of the bottle," he said to the _vivandi\xc3\xa8re_.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean," was her answer, "what\'s left there costs ten francs,\r\non a day like this."\r\n\r\nAs he rejoined the escort at a gallop:\r\n\r\n"Ah! You\'re bringing us a drop of drink," cried the serjeant. "That was\r\nwhy you deserted, was it? Hand it over."\r\n\r\nThe bottle went round, the last man to take it flung it in the air after\r\ndrinking. "Thank you, chum!" he cried to Fabrizio. All eyes were\r\nfastened on him kindly. This friendly gaze lifted a hundredweight from\r\nFabrizio\'s heart; it was one of those hearts of too delicate tissue\r\nwhich require the friendship of those around it. So at last he had\r\nceased to be looked at askance by his comrades; there was a bond between\r\nthem! Fabrizio breathed a deep sigh of relief, then in a bold voice said\r\nto the serjeant:\r\n\r\n"And if Captain Teulier has been killed, where shall I find my sister?"\r\nHe fancied himself a little Machiavelli to be saying Teulier so\r\nnaturally instead of Meunier.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what you\'ll find out to-night," was the serjeant\'s reply.\r\n\r\nThe escort moved on again and made for some divisions of infantry.\r\nFabrizio felt quite drunk; he had taken too much brandy, he was rolling\r\nslightly in his saddle: he remembered most opportunely a favourite\r\nsaying of his mother\'s coachman: "When you\'ve been lifting your elbow,\r\nlook straight between your horse\'s ears, and do what the man next you\r\ndoes." The Marshal stopped for some time beside a number of cavalry\r\nunits which he ordered to charge; but for an hour or two our hero was\r\nbarely conscious of what was going on round about him. He was feeling\r\nextremely tired, and when his horse galloped he fell back on the saddle\r\nlike a lump of lead.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the serjeant called out to his men: "Don\'t you see the Emperor,\r\ncurse you!" Whereupon the escort shouted: "_Vive l\'Empereur_!" at the\r\ntop of their voices. It may be imagined that our hero stared till his\r\neyes started out of his head, but all he saw was some generals\r\ngalloping, also followed by an escort. The long floating plumes of\r\nhorsehair which the dragoons of the bodyguard wore on their helmets\r\nprevented him from distinguishing their faces. "So I have missed seeing\r\nthe Emperor on a field of battle, all because of those cursed glasses of\r\nbrandy!" This reflexion brought him back to his senses.\r\n\r\nThey went down into a road filled with water, the horses wished to\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\n"So that was the Emperor who went past then?" he asked the man next to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Why, surely, the one with no braid on his coat. How is it you didn\'t\r\nsee him?" his comrade answered kindly. Fabrizio felt a strong desire to\r\ngallop after the Emperor\'s escort and embody himself in it. What a joy\r\nto go really to war in the train of that hero! It was for that he\r\nhad come to France. "I am quite at liberty to do it," he said to\r\nhimself, "for after all I have no other reason for being where I am but\r\nthe will of my horse, which started galloping after these generals."\r\n\r\nWhat made Fabrizio decide to stay where he was was that the hussars, his\r\nnew comrades, seemed so friendly towards him; he began to imagine\r\nhimself the intimate friend of all the troopers with whom he had been\r\ngalloping for the last few hours. He saw arise between them and himself\r\nthat noble friendship of the heroes of Tasso and Ariosto. If he were to\r\nattach himself to the Emperor\'s escort, there would be fresh\r\nacquaintances to be made, perhaps they would look at him askance, for\r\nthese other horsemen were dragoons, and he was wearing the hussar\r\nuniform like all the rest that were following the Marshal. The way in\r\nwhich they now looked at him set our hero on a pinnacle of happiness; he\r\nwould have done anything in the world for his comrades; his mind and\r\nsoul were in the clouds. Everything seemed to have assumed a new aspect\r\nnow that he was among friends; he was dying to ask them various\r\nquestions. "But I am still a little drunk," he said to himself, "I must\r\nbear in mind what the gaoler\'s wife told me." He noticed on leaving the\r\nsunken road that the escort was no longer with Marshal Ney; the general\r\nwhom they were following was tall and thin, with a dry face and an\r\nawe-inspiring eye.\r\n\r\nThis general was none other than Comte d\'A----, the Lieutenant Robert of\r\nthe 15th of May, 1796. How delighted he would have been to meet Fabrizio\r\ndel Dongo!\r\n\r\nIt was already some time since Fabrizio had noticed the earth flying off\r\nin black crumbs on being struck by shot; they came in rear of a regiment\r\nof cuirassiers, he could hear distinctly the rattle of the grapeshot\r\nagainst their breastplates, and saw several men fall.\r\n\r\nThe sun was now very low and had begun to set when the escort, emerging\r\nfrom a sunken road, mounted a little bank three or four feet high to\r\nenter a ploughed field. Fabrizio heard an odd little sound quite close\r\nto him: he turned his head, four men had fallen with their horses; the\r\ngeneral himself had been unseated, but picked himself up, covered in\r\nblood. Fabrizio looked at the hussars who were lying on the ground:\r\nthree of them were still making convulsive movements, the fourth cried:\r\n"Pull me out!" The serjeant and two or three men had dismounted to\r\nassist the general who, leaning upon his aide-de-camp, was attempting to\r\nwalk a few steps; he was trying to get away from his horse, which lay on\r\nthe ground struggling and kicking out madly.\r\n\r\nThe serjeant came up to Fabrizio. At that moment our hero heard a voice\r\nsay behind him and quite close to his ear: "This is the only one that\r\ncan still gallop." He felt himself seized by the feet; they were taken\r\nout of the stirrups at the same time as someone caught him underneath\r\nthe arms; he was lifted over his horse\'s tail and then allowed to slip\r\nto the ground, where he landed sitting.\r\n\r\nThe aide-de-camp took Fabrizio\'s horse by the bridle; the general, with\r\nthe help of the serjeant, mounted and rode off at a gallop; he was\r\nquickly followed by the six men who were left of the escort. Fabrizio\r\nrose up in a fury, and began to run after them shouting: "_Ladri!\r\nLadri_! (Thieves! Thieves!)" It was an amusing experience to run after\r\nhorse-stealers across a battlefield.\r\n\r\nThe escort and the general, Comte d\'A----, disappeared presently behind\r\na row of willows. Fabrizio, blind with rage, also arrived at this line\r\nof willows; he found himself brought to a halt by a canal of\r\nconsiderable depth which he crossed. Then, on reaching the other side,\r\nhe began swearing again as he saw once more, but far away in the\r\ndistance, the general and his escort vanishing among the trees.\r\n"Thieves! Thieves!" he cried, in French this time. In desperation, not\r\nso much at the loss of his horse as at the treachery to himself, he let\r\nhimself sink down on the side of the ditch, tired out and dying of\r\nhunger. If his fine horse had been taken from him by the enemy, he would\r\nhave thought no more about it; but to see himself betrayed and robbed by\r\nthat serjeant whom he liked so much and by those hussars whom he\r\nregarded as brothers! That was what broke his heart. He could find no\r\nconsolation for so great an infamy, and, leaning his back against a\r\nwillow, began to shed hot tears. He abandoned one by one all those\r\nbeautiful dreams of a chivalrous and sublime friendship, like that of\r\nthe heroes of the _Gerusalemme Liberata_. To see death come to one was\r\nnothing, surrounded by heroic and tender hearts, by noble friends who\r\nclasp one by the hand as one yields one\'s dying breath! But to retain\r\none\'s enthusiasm surrounded by a pack of vile scoundrels! Like all angry\r\nmen Fabrizio exaggerated. After a quarter of an hour of this melting\r\nmood, he noticed that the guns were beginning to range on the row of\r\ntrees in the shade of which he sat meditating. He rose and tried to find\r\nhis bearings. He scanned those fields bounded by a wide canal and the\r\nrow of pollard willows: he thought he knew where he was. He saw a body\r\nof infantry crossing the ditch and marching over the fields, a quarter\r\nof a league in front of him. "I was just falling asleep," he said to\r\nhimself; "I must see that I\'m not taken prisoner." And he put his best\r\nfoot foremost. As he advanced, his mind was set at rest; he recognized\r\nthe uniforms, the regiments by which he had been afraid of being cut off\r\nwere French. He made a right incline so as to join them.\r\n\r\nAfter the moral anguish of having been so shamefully betrayed and\r\nrobbed, there came another which, at every moment, made itself felt more\r\nkeenly; he was dying of hunger. It was therefore with infinite joy that\r\nafter having walked, or rather run for ten minutes, he saw that the\r\ncolumn of infantry, which also had been moving very rapidly, was halting\r\nto take up a position. A few minutes later, he was among the nearest of\r\nthe soldiers.\r\n\r\n"Friends, could you sell me a mouthful of bread?"\r\n\r\n"I say, here\'s a fellow who thinks we\'re bakers!"\r\n\r\nThis harsh utterance and the general guffaw that followed it had a\r\ncrushing effect on Fabrizio. So war was no longer that noble and\r\nuniversal uplifting of souls athirst for glory which he had imagined it\r\nto be from Napoleon\'s proclamations! He sat down, or rather let himself\r\nfall on the grass; he turned very pale. The soldier who had spoken to\r\nhim, and who had stopped ten paces off to clean the lock of his musket\r\nwith his handkerchief, came nearer and flung him a lump of bread; then,\r\nseeing that he did not pick it up, broke off a piece which he put in our\r\nhero\'s mouth. Fabrizio opened his eyes, and ate the bread without having\r\nthe strength to speak. When at length he looked round for the soldier to\r\npay him, he found himself alone; the men nearest to him were a hundred\r\nyards off and were marching. Mechanically he rose and followed them. He\r\nentered a wood; he was dropping with exhaustion, and already had begun\r\nto look round for a comfortable resting-place; but what was his delight\r\non recognising first of all the horse, then the cart, and finally the\r\n_cantini\xc3\xa8re_ of that morning! She ran to him and was frightened by his\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n"Still going, my boy," she said to him; "you\'re wounded then? And\r\nwhere\'s your fine horse?" So saying she led him towards the cart, upon\r\nwhich she made him climb, supporting him under the arms. No sooner was\r\nhe in the cart than our hero, utterly worn out, fell fast asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing could awaken him, neither the muskets fired close to the cart\r\nnor the trot of the horse which the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_ was flogging with all\r\nher might. The regiment, attacked unexpectedly by swarms of Prussian\r\ncavalry, after imagining all day that they were winning the battle, was\r\nbeating a retreat or rather fleeing in the direction of France.\r\n\r\nThe colonel, a handsome young man, well turned out, who had succeeded\r\nMacon, was sabred; the battalion commander who took his place, an old\r\nman with white hair, ordered the regiment to halt. "Damn you," he cried\r\nto his men, "in the days of the Republic we waited till we were forced\r\nby the enemy before running away. Defend every inch of ground, and get\r\nyourselves killed!" he shouted, and swore at them. "It is the soil of\r\nthe Fatherland that these Prussians want to invade now!"\r\n\r\nThe little cart halted; Fabrizio awoke with a start. The sun had set\r\nsome time back; he was quite astonished to see that it was almost night.\r\nThe troops were running in all directions in a confusion which greatly\r\nsurprised our hero; they looked shame-faced, he thought.\r\n\r\n"What is happening?" he asked the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_.\r\n\r\n"Nothing at all. Only that we\'re in the soup, my boy; it\'s the Prussian\r\ncavalry mowing us down, that\'s all. The idiot of a general thought at\r\nfirst they were our men. Come, quick, help me to mend Cocotte\'s trace:\r\nit\'s broken."\r\n\r\nSeveral shots were fired ten yards off. Our hero, cool and composed,\r\nsaid to himself: "But really, I haven\'t fought at all, the whole day; I\r\nhave only escorted a general.--I must go and fight," he said to the\r\n_cantini\xc3\xa8re_.\r\n\r\n"Keep calm, you shall fight, and more than you want! We\'re done for.\r\n\r\n"Aubry, my lad," she called out to a passing corporal, "keep an eye on\r\nthe little cart now and then."\r\n\r\n"Are you going to fight?" Fabrizio asked Aubry.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, I\'m putting my pumps on to go to a dance!"\r\n\r\n"I shall follow you."\r\n\r\n"I tell you, he\'s all right, the little hussar," cried the\r\n_cantini\xc3\xa8re_. "The young gentleman has a stout heart." Corporal Aubry\r\nmarched on without saying a word. Eight or nine soldiers ran up and\r\njoined him; he led them behind a big oak surrounded by brambles. On\r\nreaching it he posted them along the edge of the wood, still without\r\nuttering a word, on a widely extended front, each man being at least ten\r\npaces from the next.\r\n\r\n"Now then, you men," said the corporal, opening his mouth for the first\r\ntime, "don\'t fire till I give the order: remember you\'ve only got three\r\nrounds each."\r\n\r\n"Why, what is happening?" Fabrizio wondered. At length, when he found\r\nhimself alone with the corporal, he said to him: "I have no musket."\r\n\r\n"Will you hold your tongue? Go forward there: fifty paces in front of\r\nthe wood you\'ll find one of the poor fellows of the Regiment who\'ve been\r\nsabred; you will take his cartridge-pouch and his musket. Don\'t strip a\r\nwounded man, though; take the pouch and musket from one who\'s properly\r\ndead, and hurry up or you\'ll be shot in the bade by our fellows."\r\nFabrizio set off at a run and returned the next minute with a musket and\r\na pouch.\r\n\r\n"Load your musket and stick yourself behind this tree, and whatever you\r\ndo don\'t fire till you get the order from me. . . . Great God in\r\nheaven!" the corporal broke off, "he doesn\'t even know how to load!" He\r\nhelped Fabrizio to do this while going on with his instructions. "If one\r\nof the enemy\'s cavalry gallops at you to cut you down, dodge round your\r\ntree and don\'t fire till he\'s within three paces: wait till your\r\nbayonet\'s practically touching his uniform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_WAR_\r\n\r\n\r\n"Throw that great sabre away," cried the corporal. "Good God, do you\r\nwant it to trip you up? Fine sort of soldiers they\'re sending us these\r\ndays!" As he spoke he himself took hold of the sabre which he flung\r\nangrily away.\r\n\r\n"You there, wipe the flint of your musket with your handkerchief. Have\r\nyou never fired a musket?"\r\n\r\n"I am a hunter."\r\n\r\n"Thank God for that!" went on the corporal with a loud sigh. "Whatever\r\nyou do, don\'t fire till I give the order." And he moved away.\r\n\r\nFabrizio was supremely happy. "Now I\'m going to do some real fighting,"\r\nhe said to himself, "and kill one of the enemy. This morning they were\r\nsending cannonballs over, and I did nothing but expose myself and risk\r\ngetting killed; that\'s a fool\'s game." He gazed all round him with\r\nextreme curiosity. Presently he heard seven or eight shots fired quite\r\nclose at hand. But receiving no order to fire he stood quietly behind\r\nhis tree. It was almost night; he felt he was in a _look-out_,\r\nbear-shootings on the mountain of Tramezzina, above Grianta. A hunter\'s\r\nidea came to him: he took a cartridge from his pouch and removed the\r\nball. "If I see him," he said, "it won\'t do to miss him," and he slipped\r\nthis second ball into the barrel of his musket. He heard shots fired\r\nclose to his tree; at the same moment he saw a horseman in blue pass in\r\nfront of him at a gallop, going from right to left. "It is more than\r\nthree paces," he said to himself, "but at that range I am certain of my\r\nmark." He kept the trooper carefully sighted with his musket and finally\r\npressed the trigger: the trooper fell with his horse. Our hero imagined\r\nhe was stalking game: he ran joyfully out to collect his bag. He was\r\nactually touching the man, who appeared to him to be dying, when, with\r\nincredible speed, two Prussian troopers charged down on him to sabre\r\nhim. Fabrizio dashed back as fast as he could go to the wood; to gain\r\nspeed he flung his musket away. The Prussian troopers were not more than\r\nthree paces from him when he reached another plantation of young oaks,\r\nas thick as his arm and quite upright, which fringed the wood. These\r\nlittle oaks delayed the horsemen for a moment, but they passed them and\r\ncontinued their pursuit of Fabrizio along a clearing. Once again they\r\nwere just overtaking him when he slipped in among seven or eight big\r\ntrees. At that moment his face was almost scorched by the flame of five\r\nor six musket shots fired from in front of him. He ducked his head; when\r\nhe raised it again he found himself face to face with the corporal.\r\n\r\n"Did you kill your man?" Corporal Aubry asked him.\r\n\r\n"Yes; but I\'ve lost my musket."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not muskets we\'re short of. You\'re not a bad b----; though you do\r\nlook as green as a cabbage you\'ve won the day all right, and these men\r\nhere have just missed the two who were chasing you and coming straight\r\nat them. I didn\'t see them myself. What we\'ve got to do now is to get\r\naway at the double; the Regiment must be half a mile off, and there\'s a\r\nbit of a field to cross, too, where we may find ourselves surrounded."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the corporal marched off at a brisk pace at the head of his\r\nten men. Two hundred yards farther on, as they entered the little field\r\nhe had mentioned, they came upon a wounded general who was being carried\r\nby his aide-de-camp and an orderly.\r\n\r\n"Give me four of your men," he said to the corporal in a faint voice,\r\n"I\'ve got to be carried to the ambulance; my leg is shattered."\r\n\r\n"Go and f---- yourself!" replied the corporal, "you and all your\r\ngenerals. You\'ve all of you betrayed the Emperor to-day."\r\n\r\n"What," said the general, furious, "you dispute my orders. Do you know\r\nthat I am General Comte B----, commanding your Division," and so on. He\r\nwaxed rhetorical. The aide-de-camp flung himself on the men. The\r\ncorporal gave him a thrust in the arm with his bayonet, then made off\r\nwith his party at the double. "I wish they were all in your boat," he\r\nrepeated with an oath; "I\'d shatter their arms and legs for them. A pack\r\nof puppies! All of them bought by the Bourbons, to betray the Emperor!"\r\nFabrizio listened with a thrill of horror to this frightful accusation.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o\'clock that night the little party overtook their regiment on\r\nthe outskirts of a large village which divided the road into several\r\nvery narrow streets; but Fabrizio noticed that Corporal Aubry avoided\r\nspeaking to any of the officers. "We can\'t get on," he called to his\r\nmen. All these streets were blocked with infantry, cavalry, and, worst\r\nof all, by the limbers and wagons of the artillery. The corporal tried\r\nthree of these streets in turn; after advancing twenty yards he was\r\nobliged to halt. Everyone was swearing and losing his temper.\r\n\r\n"Some traitor in command here, too!" cried the corporal: "if the enemy\r\nhas the sense to surround the village, we shall all be caught like rats\r\nin a trap. Follow me, you." Fabrizio looked round; there were only six\r\nmen left with the corporal. Through a big gate which stood open they\r\ncame into a huge courtyard; from this courtyard they passed into a\r\nstable, the back door of which let them into a garden. They lost their\r\nway for a moment and wandered blindly about. But finally, going through\r\na hedge, they found themselves in a huge field of buckwheat. In less\r\nthan half an hour, guided by the shouts and confused noises, they had\r\nregained the high road on the other side of the village. The ditches on\r\neither side of this road were filled with muskets that had been thrown\r\naway; Fabrizio selected one: but the road, although very broad, was so\r\nblocked with stragglers and transport that in the next half-hour the\r\ncorporal and Fabrizio had not advanced more than five hundred yards at\r\nthe most; they were told that this road led to Charleroi. As the village\r\nclock struck eleven:\r\n\r\n"Let us cut across the fields again," said the corporal. The little\r\nparty was reduced now to three men, the corporal and Fabrizio. When they\r\nhad gone a quarter of a league from the high road: "I\'m done," said one\r\nof the soldiers.\r\n\r\n"Me, too!" said another.\r\n\r\n"That\'s good news! We\'re all in the same boat," said the corporal; "but\r\ndo what I tell you and you\'ll get through all right." His eye fell on\r\nfive or six trees marking the line of a little ditch in the middle of an\r\nimmense cornfield. "Make for the trees!" he told his men; "lie down," he\r\nadded when they had reached the trees, "and not a sound, remember. But\r\nbefore you go to sleep, who\'s got any bread?"\r\n\r\n"I have," said one of the men.\r\n\r\n"Give it here," said the corporal in a tone of authority. He divided the\r\nbread into five pieces and took the smallest himself.\r\n\r\n"A quarter of an hour before dawn," he said as he ate it, "you\'ll have\r\nthe enemy\'s cavalry on your backs. You\'ve got to see you\'re not sabred.\r\nA man by himself is done for with cavalry after him on these big plains,\r\nbut five can get away; keep in close touch with me, don\'t fire till\r\nthey\'re at close range, and to-morrow evening I\'ll undertake to get you\r\nto Charleroi." The corporal roused his men an hour before daybreak and\r\nmade them recharge their muskets. The noise on the high road still\r\ncontinued; it had gone on all night: it was like the sound of a torrent\r\nheard from a long way off.\r\n\r\n"They\'re like a flock of sheep running away," said Fabrizio with a\r\nguileless air to the corporal.\r\n\r\n"Will you shut your mouth, you young fool!" said the corporal, greatly\r\nindignant. And the three soldiers who with Fabrizio composed his whole\r\nforce scowled angrily at our hero as though he had uttered blasphemy. He\r\nhad insulted the nation.\r\n\r\n"That is where their strength lies!" thought our hero. "I noticed it\r\nbefore with the Viceroy at Milan; they are not running away, oh, no!\r\nWith these Frenchmen you must never speak the truth if it shocks their\r\nvanity. But as for their savage scowls, they don\'t trouble me, and I\r\nmust let them understand as much." They kept on their way, always at an\r\ninterval of five hundred yards from the torrent of fugitives that\r\ncovered the high road. A league farther on, the corporal and his party\r\ncrossed a road running into the high road in which a number of soldiers\r\nwere lying. Fabrizio purchased a fairly good horse which cost him forty\r\nfrancs, and among all the sabres that had been thrown down everywhere\r\nmade a careful choice of one that was long and straight. "Since I\'m told\r\nI\'ve got to stick them," he thought, "this is the best." Thus equipped,\r\nhe put his horse into a gallop and soon overtook the corporal who had\r\ngone on ahead. He sat up in his stirrups, took hold with his left hand\r\nof the scabbard of his straight sabre, and said to the four Frenchmen:\r\n\r\n"Those people going along the high road look like a flock of sheep . . .\r\nthey are running like frightened sheep. . . ."\r\n\r\nIn spite of his dwelling upon the word _sheep_, his companions had\r\ncompletely forgotten that it had annoyed them an hour earlier. Here we\r\nsee one of the contrasts between the Italian character and the French;\r\nthe Frenchman is no doubt the happier of the two; he glides lightly over\r\nthe events of life and bears no malice afterwards.\r\n\r\nWe shall not attempt to conceal the fact that Fabrizio was highly\r\npleased with himself after using the word _sheep_. They marched on,\r\ntalking about nothing in particular. After covering two leagues more,\r\nthe corporal, still greatly astonished to see no sign of the enemy\'s\r\ncavalry, said to Fabrizio:\r\n\r\n"You are our cavalry; gallop over to that farm on the little hill; ask\r\nthe farmer if he will _sell_ us breakfast: mind you tell him there are\r\nonly five of us. If he hesitates, put down five francs of your money in\r\nadvance; but don\'t be frightened, we\'ll take the dollar back from him\r\nafter we\'ve eaten."\r\n\r\nFabrizio looked at the corporal; he saw in his face an imperturbable\r\ngravity and really an air of moral superiority; he obeyed. Everything\r\nfell out as the commander in chief had anticipated; only, Fabrizio\r\ninsisted on their not taking back by force the five francs he had given\r\nto the farmer.\r\n\r\n"The money is mine," he said to his friends; "I\'m not paying for you,\r\nI\'m paying for the oats he\'s given my horse."\r\n\r\nFabrizio\'s French accent was so bad that his companions thought they\r\ndetected in his words a note of superiority; they were keenly annoyed,\r\nand from that moment a duel began to take shape in their minds for the\r\nend of the day. They found him very different from themselves, which\r\nshocked them; Fabrizio, on the contrary, was beginning to feel a warm\r\nfriendship towards them.\r\n\r\nThey had marched without saying a word for a couple of hours when the\r\ncorporal, looking across at the high road, exclaimed in a transport of\r\njoy: "There\'s the Regiment!" They were soon on the road; but, alas,\r\nround the eagle were mustered not more than two hundred men. Fabrizio\'s\r\neye soon caught sight of the _vivandi\xc3\xa8re_: she was going on foot, her\r\neyes were red and every now and again she burst into tears. Fabrizio\r\nlooked in vain for the little cart and Cocotte.\r\n\r\n"Stripped, ruined, robbed!" cried the _vivandi\xc3\xa8re_, in answer to our\r\nhero\'s, inquiring glance. He, without a word, got down from his horse,\r\ntook hold of the bridle and said to the _vivandi\xc3\xa8re_: "Mount!" She did\r\nnot have to be told twice.\r\n\r\n"Shorten the stirrups for me," was her only remark.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was comfortably in the saddle she began to tell Fabrizio\r\nall the disasters of the night. After a narrative of endless length but\r\neagerly drunk in by our hero who, to tell the truth, understood nothing\r\nat all of what she said but had a tender feeling for the _vivandi\xc3\xa8re_,\r\nshe went on:\r\n\r\n"And to think that they were Frenchmen who robbed me, beat me, destroyed\r\nme. . . ."\r\n\r\n"What! It wasn\'t the enemy?" said Fabrizio with an air of innocence\r\nwhich made his grave, pale face look charming.\r\n\r\n"What a fool you are, you poor boy!" said the _vivandi\xc3\xa8re_, smiling\r\nthrough her tears; "but you\'re very nice, for all that."\r\n\r\n"And such as he is, he brought down his Prussian properly," said\r\nCorporal Aubry, who, in the general confusion round them, happened to be\r\non the other side of the horse on which the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_ was sitting.\r\n"But he\'s proud," the corporal went on. . . . Fabrizio made an impulsive\r\nmovement. "And what\'s your name?" asked the corporal; "for if there\'s a\r\nreport going in I should like to mention you."\r\n\r\n"I\'m called Vasi," replied Fabrizio, with a curious expression on his\r\nface. "Boulot, I mean," he added, quickly correcting himself.\r\n\r\nBoulot was the name of the late possessor of the marching orders which\r\nthe gaoler\'s wife at B-had given him; on his way from B---- he had\r\nstudied them carefully, for he was beginning to think a little and was\r\nno longer so easily surprised. In addition to the marching orders of\r\nTrooper Boulot, he had stowed away in a safe place the precious Italian\r\npassport according to which he was entitled to the noble appellation of\r\nVasi, dealer in barometers. When the corporal had charged him with being\r\nproud, it had been on the tip of his tongue to retort: "I proud! I,\r\nFabrizio Volterra, Marchesino del Dongo, who consent to go by the name\r\nof a Vasi, dealer in barometers!"\r\n\r\nWhile he was making these reflexions and saying to himself: "I must not\r\nforget that I am called Boulot, or look-out for the prison fate\r\nthreatens me with," the corporal and the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_ had been\r\nexchanging a few words with regard to him.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say I\'m inquisitive," said the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_, ceasing to address\r\nhim in the second person singular, "it\'s for your good I ask you these\r\nquestions. Who are you, now, really?"\r\n\r\nFabrizio did not reply at first. He was considering that never again\r\nwould he find more devoted friends to ask for advice, and he was in\r\nurgent need of advice from someone. "We are coming into a fortified\r\nplace, the governor will want to know who I am, and ware prison if I let\r\nhim see by my answers that I know nobody in the 4th Hussar Regiment\r\nwhose uniform I am wearing!" In his capacity as an Austrian subject,\r\nFabrizio knew all about the importance to be attached to a passport.\r\nVarious members of his family, although noble and devout, although\r\nsupporters of the winning side, had been in trouble a score of times\r\nover their passports; he was therefore not in the least put out by the\r\nquestion which the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_ had addressed to him. But as, before\r\nanswering, he had to think of the French words which would express his\r\nmeaning most clearly, the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_, pricked by a keen curiosity,\r\nadded, to induce him to speak: "Corporal Aubry and I are going to give\r\nyou some good advice."\r\n\r\n"I have no doubt you are," replied Fabrizio. "My name is Vasi and I come\r\nfrom Genoa; my sister, who is famous for her beauty, is married to a\r\ncaptain. As I am only seventeen, she made me come to her to let me see\r\nsomething of France, and form my character a little; not finding her in\r\nParis, and knowing that she was with this army, I came on here. I\'ve\r\nsearched for her everywhere and haven\'t found her. The soldiers, who\r\nwere puzzled by my accent, had me arrested. I had money then, I gave\r\nsome to the _gendarme_, who let me have some marching orders and a\r\nuniform, and said to me: \'Get away with you, and swear you\'ll never\r\nmention my name.\'\r\n\r\n"What was he called?" asked the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve given my word," said Fabrizio.\r\n\r\n"He\'s right," put in the corporal, "the _gendarme_ is a sweep, but our\r\nfriend ought not to give his name. And what is the other one called,\r\nthis captain, your sister\'s husband? If we knew his name, we could try\r\nto find him."\r\n\r\n"Teulier, Captain in the 4th Hussars," replied our hero.\r\n\r\n"And so," said the corporal, with a certain subtlety, "from your foreign\r\naccent the soldiers took you for a spy?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the abominable word!" cried Fabrizio, his eyes blazing. "I who\r\nlove the Emperor so and the French people! And it was that insult that\r\nannoyed me more than anything."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no insult about it; that\'s where you\'re wrong; the soldiers\'\r\nmistake was quite natural," replied Corporal Aubry gravely.\r\n\r\nAnd he went on to explain in the most pedantic manner that in the army\r\none must belong to some corps and wear a uniform, failing which it was\r\nquite simple that people should take one for a spy. "The enemy sends us\r\nany number of them; everybody\'s a traitor in this war." The scales fell\r\nfrom Fabrizio\'s eyes; he realised for the first time that he had been in\r\nthe wrong in everything that had happened to him during the last two\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n"But make the boy tell us the whole story," said the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_, her\r\ncuriosity more and more excited. Fabrizio obeyed. When he had finished:\r\n\r\n"It comes to this," said the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_, speaking in a serious tone\r\nto the corporal, "this child is not a soldier at all; we\'re going to\r\nhave a bloody war now that we\'ve been beaten and betrayed. Why should he\r\ngo and get his bones broken free, gratis and for nothing?"\r\n\r\n"Especially," put in the corporal, "as he doesn\'t even know how to load\r\nhis musket, neither by numbers, nor in his own time. It was I put in the\r\nshot that brought down the Prussian."\r\n\r\n"Besides, he lets everyone see the colour of his money," added the\r\n_cantini\xc3\xa8re_; "he will be robbed of all he has as soon as he hasn\'t got\r\nus to look after him."\r\n\r\n"The first cavalry non-com he comes across," said the corporal, "will\r\ntake it from him to pay for his drink, and perhaps they\'ll enlist him\r\nfor the enemy; they\'re all traitors. The first man he meets will order\r\nhim to follow, and he\'ll follow him; he would do better to join our\r\nRegiment."\r\n\r\n"No, please, if you don\'t mind, corporal!" Fabrizio exclaimed with\r\nanimation; "I am more comfortable on a horse. And, besides, I don\'t know\r\nhow to load a musket, and you have seen that I can manage a horse."\r\n\r\nFabrizio was extremely proud of this little speech. We need not report\r\nthe long discussion that followed between the corporal and the\r\n_cantini\xc3\xa8re_ as to his future destiny. Fabrizio noticed that in\r\ndiscussing him these people repeated three or four times all the\r\ncircumstances of his story: the soldiers\' suspicions, the _gendarme_\r\nselling him marching orders and a uniform, the accident by which, the\r\nday before, he had found himself forming part of the Marshal\'s escort,\r\nthe glimpse of the Emperor as he galloped past, the horse that had been\r\n_scoffed_ from him, and so on indefinitely.\r\n\r\nWith feminine curiosity the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_ kept harking back incessantly\r\nto the way in which he had been dispossessed of the good horse which she\r\nhad made him buy.\r\n\r\n"You felt yourself seized by the feet, they lifted you gently over your\r\nhorse\'s tail, and sat you down on the ground!" "Why repeat so often,"\r\nFabrizio said to himself, "what all three of us know perfectly well?" He\r\nhad not yet discovered that this is how, in France, the lower orders\r\nproceed in quest of ideas.\r\n\r\n"How much money have you?" the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_ asked him suddenly.\r\nFabrizio had no hesitation in answering. He was sure of the nobility of\r\nthe woman\'s nature; that is the fine side of France.\r\n\r\n"Altogether, I may have got left thirty napoleons in gold, and eight or\r\nnine five-franc pieces."\r\n\r\n"In that case, you have a clear field!" exclaimed the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_.\r\n"Get right away from this rout of an army; clear out, take the first\r\nroad with ruts on it that you come to on the right; keep your horse\r\nmoving and your back to the army. At the first opportunity, buy some\r\ncivilian clothes. When you\'ve gone nine or ten leagues and there are no\r\nmore soldiers in sight, take the mail-coach, and go and rest for a week\r\nand eat beefsteaks in some nice town. Never let anyone know that you\'ve\r\nbeen in the army, or the police will take you up as a deserter; and,\r\nnice as you are, my boy, you\'re not quite clever enough yet to stand up\r\nto the police. As soon as you\'ve got civilian clothes on your back, tear\r\nup your marching orders into a thousand pieces and go back to your real\r\nname: say that you\'re Vasi. And where ought he to say he comes from?"\r\nshe asked the corporal.\r\n\r\n"From Cambrai on the Scheldt: it\'s a good town and quite small, if you\r\nknow what I mean. There\'s a cathedral there, and F\xc3\xa9nelon."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," said the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_. "Never let on to anyone that\r\nyou\'ve been in battle, don\'t breathe a word about B----, or the\r\n_gendarme_ who sold you the marching orders. When you\'re ready to go\r\nback to Paris, make first for Versailles, and pass the Paris barrier\r\nfrom that side in a leisurely way, on foot, as if you were taking a\r\nstroll. Sew up your napoleons inside your breeches, and remember, when\r\nyou have to pay for anything, shew only the exact sum that you want to\r\nspend. What makes me sad is that they\'ll take you and rob you and strip\r\nyou of everything you have. And whatever will you do without money, you\r\nthat don\'t know how to look after yourself . . ." and so on.\r\n\r\nThe good woman went on talking for some time still; the corporal\r\nindicated his support by nodding his head, not being able to get a word\r\nin himself. Suddenly the crowd that was packing the road first of all\r\ndoubled its pace, then, in the twinkling of an eye, crossed the little\r\nditch that bounded the road on the left and fled helter-skelter across\r\ncountry. Cries of "The Cossacks! The Cossacks!" rose from every side.\r\n\r\n"Take back your horse!" the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_ shouted.\r\n\r\n"God forbid!" said Fabrizio. "Gallop! Away with you! I give him to you.\r\nDo you want something to buy another cart with? Half of what I have is\r\nyours."\r\n\r\n"Take back your horse, I tell you!" cried the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_ angrily; and\r\nshe prepared to dismount. Fabrizio drew his sabre. "Hold on tight!" he\r\nshouted to her, and gave two or three strokes with the flat of his sabre\r\nto the horse, which broke into a gallop and followed the fugitives.\r\n\r\nOur hero stood looking at the road; a moment ago, two or three thousand\r\npeople had been jostling along it, packed together like peasants at the\r\ntail of a procession. After the shout of: "Cossacks!" he saw not a soul\r\non it; the fugitives had cast away shakoes, muskets, sabres, everything.\r\nFabrizio, quite bewildered, climbed up into a field on the right of the\r\nroad and twenty or thirty feet above it; he scanned the line of the road\r\nin both directions, and the plain, but saw no trace of the Cossacks.\r\n"Funny people, these French!" he said to himself. "Since I have got to\r\ngo to the right," he thought, "I may as well start off at once; it is\r\npossible that these people have a reason for running away that I don\'t\r\nknow." He picked up a musket, saw that it was charged, shook up the\r\npowder in the priming, cleaned the flint, then chose a cartridge-pouch\r\nthat was well filled and looked round him again in all directions; he\r\nwas absolutely alone in the middle of this plain which just now had been\r\nso crowded with people. In the far distance he could see the fugitives\r\nwho were beginning to disappear behind the trees, and were still\r\nrunning. "That\'s a very odd thing," he said to himself, and remembering\r\nthe tactics employed by the corporal the night before, he went and sat\r\ndown in the middle of a field of corn. He did not go farther because he\r\nwas anxious to see again his good friends the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_ and Corporal\r\nAubry.\r\n\r\nIn this cornfield, he made the discovery that he had no more than\r\neighteen napoleons, instead of thirty as he had supposed; but he still\r\nhad some small diamonds which he had stowed away in the lining of the\r\nhussar\'s boots, before dawn, in the gaoler\'s wife\'s room at B----. He\r\nconcealed his napoleons as best he could, pondering deeply the while on\r\nthe sudden disappearance of the others. "Is that a bad omen for me?" he\r\nasked himself. What distressed him most was that he had not asked\r\nCorporal Aubry the question: "Have I really taken part in a battle?" It\r\nseemed to him that he had, and his happiness would have known no bounds\r\ncould he have been certain of this.\r\n\r\n"But even if I have," he said to himself, "I took part in it bearing the\r\nname of a prisoner, I had a prisoner\'s marching orders in my pocket,\r\nand, worse still, his coat on my back! That is the fatal threat to my\r\nfuture: what would the Priore Blan\xc3\xa8s say to it? And that wretched\r\nBoulot died in prison. It is all of the most sinister augury; fate will\r\nlead me to prison." Fabrizio would have given anything in the world to\r\nknow whether Trooper Boulot had really been guilty; when he searched his\r\nmemory, he seemed to recollect that the gaoler\'s wife had told him that\r\nthe hussar had been taken up not only for the theft of silver plate but\r\nalso for stealing a cow from a peasant and nearly beating the peasant to\r\ndeath: Fabrizio had no doubt that he himself would be sent to prison\r\nsome day for a crime which would bear some relation to that of Trooper\r\nBoulot. He thought of his friend the _parroco_ Blan\xc3\xa8s: what would he\r\nnot have given for an opportunity of consulting him! Then he remembered\r\nthat he had not written to his aunt since leaving Paris. "Poor Gina!" he\r\nsaid to himself. And tears stood in his eyes, when suddenly he heard a\r\nslight sound quite close to him: a soldier was feeding three horses on\r\nthe standing corn; he had taken the bits out of their mouths and they\r\nseemed half dead with hunger; he was holding them by the snaffle.\r\nFabrizio got up like a partridge; the soldier seemed frightened. Our\r\nhero noticed this, and yielded to the pleasure of playing the hussar for\r\na moment.\r\n\r\n"One of those horses belongs to me, f---- you, but I don\'t mind giving\r\nyou five francs for the trouble you\'ve taken in bringing it here."\r\n\r\n"What are you playing at?" said the soldier. Fabrizio took aim at him\r\nfrom a distance of six paces.\r\n\r\n"Let go the horse, or I\'ll blow your head off."\r\n\r\nThe soldier had his musket slung on his back; he reached over his\r\nshoulder to seize it.\r\n\r\n"If you move an inch, you\'re a dead man!" cried Fabrizio, rushing upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"All right, give me the five francs and take one of the horses," said\r\nthe embarrassed soldier, after casting a rueful glance at the high road,\r\non which there was absolutely no one to be seen. Fabrizio, keeping his\r\nmusket raised in his left hand, with the right flung him three five\r\nfranc pieces.\r\n\r\n"Dismount, or you\'re a dead man. Bridle the black, and go farther off\r\nwith the other two. . . . If you move, I fire."\r\n\r\nThe soldier looked savage but obeyed. Fabrizio went up to the horse and\r\npassed the rein over his left arm, without losing sight of the soldier,\r\nwho was moving slowly away; when our hero saw that he had gone fifty\r\npaces, he jumped nimbly on to the horse. He had barely mounted and was\r\nfeeling with his foot for the off stirrup when he heard a bullet whistle\r\npast close to his head; it was the soldier who had fired at him.\r\nFabrizio, beside himself with rage, started galloping after the soldier\r\nwho ran off as fast as his legs could carry him, and presently Fabrizio\r\nsaw him mount one of his two horses and gallop away. "Good, he\'s out of\r\nrange now," he said to himself. The horse he had just bought was a\r\nmagnificent animal, but seemed half starved. Fabrizio returned to the\r\nhigh road, where there was still not a living soul; he crossed it and\r\nput his horse into a trot to reach a little fold in the ground on the\r\nleft, where he hoped to find the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_; but when he was at the\r\ntop of the little rise he could see nothing save, more than a league\r\naway, a few scattered troops. "It is written that I shall not see her\r\nagain," he said to himself with a sigh, "the good, brave woman!" He came\r\nto a farm which he had seen in the distance on the right of the road.\r\nWithout dismounting, and after paying for it in advance, he made the\r\nfarmer produce some oats for his poor horse, which was so famished that\r\nit began to gnaw the manger. An hour later, Fabrizio was trotting along\r\nthe high road, still in the hope of meeting the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_, or at any\r\nrate Corporal Aubry. Moving all the time and keeping a look-out all\r\nround him, he came to a marshy river crossed by a fairly narrow wooden\r\nbridge. Between him and the bridge, on the right of the road, was a\r\nsolitary house bearing the sign of the White Horse. "There I shall get\r\nsome dinner," thought Fabrizio. A cavalry officer with his arm in a\r\nsling was guarding the approach to the bridge; he was on horseback and\r\nlooked very melancholy; ten paces away from him, three dismounted\r\ntroopers were filling their pipes.\r\n\r\n"There are some people," Fabrizio said to himself, "who look to me very\r\nmuch as though they would like to buy my horse for even less than he\r\ncost me." The wounded officer and the three men on foot watched him\r\napproach and seemed to be waiting for him. "It would be better not to\r\ncross by this bridge, but to follow the river bank to the right; that\r\nwas the way the _cantini\xc3\xa8re_ advised me to take to get clear of\r\ndifficulties. . . . Yes," thought our hero, "but if I take to my heels\r\nnow, to-morrow I shall be thoroughly ashamed of myself; besides, my\r\nhorse has good legs, the officer\'s is probably tired; if he tries to\r\nmake me dismount I shall gallop." Reasoning thus with himself, Fabrizio\r\npulled up his horse and moved forward at the slowest possible pace.\r\n\r\n"Advance, you, hussar!" the officer called to him with an air of\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nFabrizio went on a few paces and then halted.\r\n\r\n"Do you want to take my horse?" he shouted.\r\n\r\n"Not in the least; advance."\r\n\r\nFabrizio examined the officer; he had a white moustache, and looked the\r\nbest fellow in the world; the handkerchief that held up his left arm was\r\ndrenched with blood, and his right hand also was bound up in a piece of\r\nbloodstained linen. "It is the men on foot who are going to snatch my\r\nbridle," thought Fabrizio; but, on looking at them from nearer, he saw\r\nthat they too were wounded.\r\n\r\n"On your honour as a soldier," said the officer, who wore the epaulettes\r\nof a colonel, "stay here on picket, and tell all the dragoons, chasseurs\r\nand hussars that you see that Colonel Le Baron is in the inn over there,\r\nand that I order them to come and report to me." The old colonel had the\r\nair of a man broken by suffering; with his first words he had made a\r\nconquest of our hero, who replied with great good sense:\r\n\r\n"I am very young, sir, to make them listen to me; I ought to have a\r\nwritten order from you."\r\n\r\n"He is right," said the colonel, studying him closely; "make out the\r\norder, La Rose, you\'ve got the use of your right hand."\r\n\r\nWithout saying a word, La Rose took from his pocket a little parchment\r\nbook, wrote a few lines, and, tearing out a leaf, handed it to Fabrizio;\r\nthe colonel repeated the order to him, adding that after two hours on\r\nduty he would be relieved, as was right and proper, by one of the three\r\nwounded troopers he had with him. So saying he went into the inn with\r\nhis men. Fabrizio watched them go and sat without moving at the end of\r\nhis wooden bridge, so deeply impressed had he been by the sombre, silent\r\ngrief of these three persons. "One would think they were under a spell,"\r\nhe said to himself. At length he unfolded the paper and read the order,\r\nwhich ran as follows:\r\n\r\n"Colonel Le Baron, 6th Dragoons, Commanding the 2nd Brigade of the 1st\r\nCavalry Division of the XIV Corps, orders all cavalrymen, dragoons,\r\nchasseurs and hussars, on no account to cross the bridge, and to report\r\nto him at the White Horse Inn, by the bridge, which is his headquarters.\r\n\r\n"Headquarters, by the bridge of La Sainte, June 19, 1815.\r\n\r\n           "For Colonel Le Baron, wounded in the right arm,\r\n            and by his orders,\r\n\r\n                                    "LA ROSE, _Serjeant_."\r\n\r\nFabrizio had been on guard at the bridge for barely half an hour when he\r\nsaw six chasseurs approaching him mounted, and three on foot; he\r\ncommunicated the colonel\'s order to them. "We\'re coming back," said four\r\nof the mounted men, and crossed the bridge at a fast trot. Fabrizio then\r\nspoke to the other two. During the discussion, which grew heated, the\r\nthree men on foot crossed the bridge. Finally, one of the two mounted\r\ntroopers who had stayed behind asked to see the order again, and carried\r\nit off, with:\r\n\r\n"I am taking it to the others, who will come back without fail; wait for\r\nthem here." And off he went at a gallop; his companion followed him. All\r\nthis had happened in the twinkling of an eye.\r\n\r\nFabrizio was furious, and called to one of the wounded soldiers, who\r\nappeared at a window of the White Horse. This soldier, on whose arm\r\nFabrizio saw the stripes of a cavalry serjeant, came down and shouted to\r\nhim: "Draw your sabre, man, you\'re on picket." Fabrizio obeyed, then\r\nsaid: "They\'ve carried off the order."\r\n\r\n"They\'re out of hand after yesterday\'s affair," replied the other in a\r\nmelancholy tone. "I\'ll let you have one of my pistols; if they force\r\npast you again, fire it in the air; I shall come, or the colonel himself\r\nwill appear."\r\n\r\nFabrizio had not failed to observe the serjeant\'s start of surprise on\r\nhearing of the theft of the order. He realised that it was a personal\r\ninsult to himself, and promised himself that he would not allow such a\r\ntrick to be played on him again.\r\n\r\nArmed with the serjeant\'s horse-pistol, Fabrizio had proudly resumed his\r\nguard when he saw coming towards him seven hussars, mounted. He had\r\ntaken up a position that barred the bridge; he read them the colonel\'s\r\norder, which seemed greatly to annoy them; the most venturesome of them\r\ntried to pass. Fabrizio, following the wise counsel of his friend the\r\n_vivandi\xc3\xa8re_, who, the morning before, had told him that he must thrust\r\nand not slash, lowered the point of his long, straight sabre and made as\r\nthough to stab with it the man who was trying to pass him.\r\n\r\n"Oh, so he wants to kill us, the baby!" cried the hussars, "as if we\r\nhadn\'t been killed quite enough yesterday!" They all drew their sabres\r\nat once and fell on Fabrizio: he gave himself up for dead; but he\r\nthought of the serjeant\'s surprise, and was not anxious to earn his\r\ncontempt again. Drawing back on to his bridge, he tried to reach them\r\nwith his sabre-point. He looked so absurd when he tried to wield this\r\nhuge, straight heavy-dragoon sabre, a great deal too heavy for him, that\r\nthe hussars soon saw with what sort of soldier they had to deal; they\r\nthen endeavoured not to wound him but to slash his clothing. In this way\r\nFabrizio received three or four slight sabre-cuts on his arms. For his\r\nown part, still faithful to the _cantini\xc3\xa8re\'s_ precept, he kept\r\nthrusting the point of his sabre at them with all his might. As ill luck\r\nwould have it, one of these thrusts wounded a hussar in the hand: highly\r\nindignant at being touched by so raw a recruit, he replied with a\r\ndownward thrust which caught Fabrizio in the upper part of the thigh.\r\nWhat made this blow effective was that our hero\'s horse, so far from\r\navoiding the fray, seemed to take pleasure in it and to be flinging\r\nhimself on the assailants. These, seeing Fabrizio\'s blood streaming\r\nalong his right arm, were afraid that they might have carried the game\r\ntoo far, and, pushing him against the left hand parapet of the bridge,\r\ncrossed at a gallop. As soon as Fabrizio had a moment to himself he\r\nfired his pistol in the air to warn the colonel.\r\n\r\nFour mounted hussars and two on foot, of the same regiment as the\r\nothers, were coming towards the bridge and were still two hundred yards\r\naway from it when the pistol went off. They had been paying close\r\nattention to what was happening on the bridge, and, imagining that\r\nFabrizio had fired at their comrades, the four mounted men galloped upon\r\nhim with raised sabres: it was a regular cavalry charge. Colonel Le\r\nBaron, summoned by the pistol-shot, opened the door of the inn and\r\nrushed on to the bridge just as the galloping hussars reached it, and\r\nhimself gave them the order to halt.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no colonel here now!" cried one of them, and pressed on his\r\nhorse. The colonel in exasperation broke off the reprimand he was giving\r\nthem, and with his wounded right hand seized the rein of this horse on\r\nthe off side.\r\n\r\n"Halt! You bad soldier," he said to the hussar; "I know you, you\'re in\r\nCaptain Henriot\'s squadron."\r\n\r\n"Very well, then! The captain can give me the order himself! Captain\r\nHenriot was killed yesterday," he added with a snigger, "and you can go\r\nand f---- yourself!"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he tried to force a passage, and pushed the old colonel who\r\nfell in a sitting position on the roadway of the bridge. Fabrizio, who\r\nwas a couple of yards farther along upon the bridge, but facing the inn,\r\npressed his horse, and, while the breast-piece of the assailant\'s\r\nharness threw down the old colonel who never let go the off rein,\r\nFabrizio, indignant, bore down upon the hussar with a driving thrust.\r\nFortunately the hussar\'s horse, feeling itself pulled towards the ground\r\nby the rein which the colonel still held, made a movement sideways, with\r\nthe result that the long blade of Fabrizio\'s heavy-cavalry sabre slid\r\nalong the hussar\'s jacket, and the whole length of it passed beneath his\r\neyes. Furious, the hussar turned round and, using all his strength,\r\ndealt Fabrizio a blow which cut his sleeve and went deep into his arm:\r\nour hero fell.\r\n\r\nOne of the dismounted hussars, seeing the two defenders of the bridge on\r\nthe ground, seized the opportunity, jumped on to Fabrizio\'s horse and\r\ntried to make off with it by starting at a gallop across the bridge.\r\n\r\nThe serjeant, as he hurried from the inn, had seen his colonel fall, and\r\nsupposed him to be seriously wounded. He ran after Fabrizio\'s horse and\r\nplunged the point of his sabre into the thief\'s entrails; he fell. The\r\nhussars, seeing no one now on the bridge but the serjeant, who was on\r\nfoot, crossed at a gallop and rapidly disappeared. The one on foot\r\nbolted into the fields.\r\n\r\nThe serjeant came up to the wounded men. Fabrizio was already on his\r\nfeet; he was not in great pain, but was bleeding profusely. The colonel\r\ngot up more slowly; he was quite stunned by his fall, but had received\r\nno injury. "I feel nothing," he said to the serjeant, "except the old\r\nwound in my hand."\r\n\r\nThe hussar whom the serjeant had wounded was dying.\r\n\r\n"The devil take him!" exclaimed the colonel. "But," he said to the\r\nserjeant and the two troopers who came running out, "look after this\r\nyoung man whose life I have risked, most improperly. I shall stay on the\r\nbridge myself and try to stop these madmen. Take the young man to the\r\ninn and tie up his arm. Use one of my shirts."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole of this adventure had not lasted a minute. Fabrizio\'s wounds\r\nwere nothing; they tied up his arm with bandages torn from the colonel\'s\r\nshirt. They wanted to make up a bed for him upstairs in the inn.\r\n\r\n"But while I am tucked up here on the first floor," said Fabrizio to the\r\nserjeant, "my horse, who is down in the stable, will get bored with\r\nbeing left alone and will go off with another master."\r\n\r\n"Not bad for a conscript!" said the serjeant. And they deposited\r\nFabrizio on a litter of clean straw in the same stall as his horse.\r\n\r\nThen, as he was feeling very weak, the serjeant brought him a bowl of\r\nmulled wine and talked to him for a little. Several compliments included\r\nin this conversation carried our hero to the seventh heaven.\r\n\r\nFabrizio did not wake until dawn on the following day; the horses were\r\nneighing continuously and making a frightful din; the stable was filled\r\nwith smoke. At first Fabrizio could make nothing of all this noise, and\r\ndid not even know where he was: finally, half-stifled by the smoke, it\r\noccurred to him that the house was on fire; in the twinkling of an eye\r\nhe was out of the stable and in the saddle. He raised his head; smoke\r\nwas belching violently from the two windows over the stable; and the\r\nroof was covered by a black smoke which rose curling into the air. A\r\nhundred fugitives had arrived during the night at the White Horse; they\r\nwere all shouting and swearing. The five or six whom Fabrizio could see\r\nclose at hand seemed to him to be completely drunk; one of them tried to\r\nstop him and called out to him: "Where are you taking my horse?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_WAR_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Fabrizio had gone a quarter of a league, he turned his head. There\r\nwas no one following him; the building was in flames. Fabrizio caught\r\nsight of the bridge; he remembered his wound, and felt his arm\r\ncompressed by bandages and very hot. "And the old colonel, what has\r\nbecome of him? He gave his shirt to tie up my arm." Our hero was this\r\nmorning the coolest man in the world; the amount of blood he had shed\r\nhad liberated him from all the romantic element in his character.\r\n\r\n"To the right!" he said to himself, "and no time to lose." He began\r\nquietly following the course of the river which, after passing under the\r\nbridge, ran to the right of the road. He remembered the good\r\n_cantini\xc3\xa8re\'s_ advice. "What friendship!" he said to himself, "what an\r\nopen nature!"\r\n\r\nAfter riding for an hour he felt very weak. "Oho! Am I going to faint?"\r\nhe wondered. "If I faint, someone will steal my horse, and my clothes,\r\nperhaps, and my money and jewels with them." He had no longer the\r\nstrength to hold the reins, and was trying to keep his balance in the\r\nsaddle when a peasant who was digging in a field by the side of the high\r\nroad noticed his pallor and came up to offer him a glass of beer and\r\nsome bread.\r\n\r\n"When I saw you look so pale, I thought you must be one of the wounded\r\nfrom the great battle," the peasant told him. Never did help come more\r\nopportunely. As Fabrizio was munching the piece of bread his eyes began\r\nto hurt him when he looked straight ahead. When he felt a little better\r\nhe thanked the man. "And where am I?" he asked. The peasant told him\r\nthat three quarters of a league farther on he would come to the township\r\nof Zonders, where he would be very well looked after. Fabrizio reached\r\nthe town, not knowing quite what he was doing and thinking only at every\r\nstep of not falling off his horse. He saw a big door standing open; he\r\nentered. It was the Woolcomb Inn. At once there ran out to him the good\r\nlady of the house, an enormous woman; she called for help in a voice\r\nthat throbbed with pity. Two girls came and helped Fabrizio to dismount;\r\nno sooner had his feet touched the ground than he fainted completely. A\r\nsurgeon was fetched, who bled him. For the rest of that day and the days\r\nthat followed Fabrizio scarcely knew what was being done to him; he\r\nslept almost without interruption.\r\n\r\nThe sabre wound in his thigh threatened to form a serious abscess. When\r\nhis mind was clear again, he asked them to look after his horse, and\r\nkept on repeating that he would pay them well, which shocked the good\r\nhostess and her daughters. For a fortnight he was admirably looked after\r\nand he was beginning to be himself again when he noticed one evening\r\nthat his hostesses seemed greatly upset. Presently a German officer came\r\ninto his room: in answering his questions they used a language which\r\nFabrizio did not understand, but he could see that they were speaking\r\nabout him; he pretended to be asleep. A little later, when he thought\r\nthat the officer must have gone, he called his hostesses.\r\n\r\n"That officer came to put my name on a list, and make me a prisoner,\r\ndidn\'t he?" The landlady assented with tears in her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Very well, there is money in my dolman!" he cried, sitting up in bed;\r\n"buy me some civilian clothes and to-night I shall go away on my horse.\r\nYou have already saved my life once by taking me in just as I was going\r\nto drop down dead in the street; save it again by giving me the means of\r\ngoing back to my mother."\r\n\r\nAt this point the landlady\'s daughters began to dissolve in tears; they\r\ntrembled for Fabrizio; and, as they barely understood French, they came\r\nto his bedside to question him. They talked with their mother in\r\nFlemish; but at every moment pitying eyes were turned on our hero; he\r\nthought he could make out that his escape might compromise them\r\nseriously, but that they would gladly incur the risk. A Jew in the town\r\nsupplied a complete outfit, but when he brought it to the inn about ten\r\no\'clock that night, the girls saw, on comparing it with Fabrizio\'s\r\ndolman, that it would require an endless amount of alteration. At once\r\nthey set to work; there was no time to lose. Fabrizio showed them where\r\nseveral napoleons were hidden in his uniform, and begged his hostesses\r\nto stitch them into the new garments. With these had come a fine pair of\r\nnew boots. Fabrizio had no hesitation in asking these kind girls to slit\r\nopen the hussar\'s boots at the place which he shewed them, and they hid\r\nthe little diamonds in the lining of the new pair.\r\n\r\nOne curious result of his loss of blood and the weakness that followed\r\nfrom it was that Fabrizio had almost completely forgotten his French; he\r\nused Italian to address his hostesses, who themselves spoke a Flemish\r\ndialect, so that their conversation had to be conducted almost entirely\r\nin signs. When the girls, who for that matter were entirely\r\ndisinterested, saw the diamonds, their enthusiasm for Fabrizio knew no\r\nbounds; they imagined him to be a prince in disguise. Aniken, the\r\nyounger and less sophisticated, kissed him without ceremony. Fabrizio,\r\nfor his part, found them charming, and towards midnight, when the\r\nsurgeon had allowed him a little wine in view of the journey he had to\r\ntake, he felt almost inclined not to go. "Where could I be better off\r\nthan here?" he asked himself. However, about two o\'clock in the morning,\r\nhe rose and dressed. As he was leaving the room, his good hostess\r\ninformed him that his horse had been taken by the officer who had come\r\nto search the house that afternoon.\r\n\r\n"Ah! The swine!" cried Fabrizio with an oath, "robbing a wounded man!"\r\nHe was not enough of a philosopher, this young Italian, to bear in mind\r\nthe price at which he himself had acquired the horse.\r\n\r\nAniken told him with tears that they had hired a horse for him. She\r\nwould have liked him not to go. Their farewells were tender. Two big\r\nlads, cousins of the good landlady, helped Fabrizio into the saddle:\r\nduring the journey they supported him on his horse, while a third, who\r\nwalked a few hundred yards in advance of the little convoy, searched the\r\nroads for any suspicious patrol. After going for a couple of hours, they\r\nstopped at the house of a cousin of the landlady of the Woolcomb. In\r\nspite of anything that Fabrizio might say, the young men who accompanied\r\nhim refused absolutely to leave him; they claimed that they knew better\r\nthan anyone the hidden paths through the woods.\r\n\r\n"But to-morrow morning, when my flight becomes known, and they don\'t see\r\nyou anywhere in the town, your absence will make things awkward for\r\nyou," said Fabrizio.\r\n\r\nThey proceeded on their way. Fortunately, when day broke at last, the\r\nplain was covered by a thick fog. About eight o\'clock in the morning\r\nthey came in sight of a little town. One of the young men went on ahead\r\nto see if the post-horses there had been stolen. The postmaster had had\r\ntime to make them vanish and to raise a team of wretched screws with\r\nwhich he had filled his stables. Grooms were sent to find a pair of\r\nhorses in the marshes where they were hidden, and three hours later\r\nFabrizio climbed into a little cabriolet which was quite dilapidated but\r\nhad harnessed to it a pair of good post-horses. He had regained his\r\nstrength. The moment of parting with the young men, his hostess\'s\r\ncousins, was pathetic in the extreme; on no account, whatever friendly\r\npretext Fabrizio might find, would they consent to take any money.\r\n\r\n"In your condition, sir, you need it more than we do," was the\r\ninvariable reply of these worthy young fellows. Finally they set off\r\nwith letters in which Fabrizio, somewhat emboldened by the agitation of\r\nthe journey, had tried to convey to his hostesses all that he felt for\r\nthem. Fabrizio wrote with tears in his eyes, and there was certainly\r\nlove in the letter addressed to little Aniken.\r\n\r\nIn the rest of the journey there was nothing out of the common. He\r\nreached Amiens in great pain from the cut he had received in his thigh;\r\nit had not occurred to the country doctor to lance the wound, and in\r\nspite of the bleedings an abscess had formed. During the fortnight that\r\nFabrizio spent in the inn at Amiens, kept by an obsequious and\r\navaricious family, the Allies were invading France, and Fabrizio became\r\nanother man, so many and profound were his reflexions on the things that\r\nhad happened to him. He had remained a child upon one point only: what\r\nhe had seen, was it a battle; and, if so, was that battle Waterloo? For\r\nthe first time in his life he found pleasure in reading; he was always\r\nhoping to find in the newspapers, or in the published accounts of the\r\nbattle, some description which would enable him to identify the ground\r\nhe had covered with Marshal Ney\'s escort, and afterwards with the other\r\ngeneral. During his stay at Amiens he wrote almost every day to his good\r\nfriends at the Woolcomb. As soon as his wound was healed, he came to\r\nParis. He found at his former hotel a score of letters from his mother\r\nand aunt, who implored him to return home as soon as possible. The last\r\nletter from Contessa Pietranera had a certain enigmatic tone which made\r\nhim extremely uneasy; this letter destroyed all his tender fancies. His\r\nwas a character to which a single word was enough to make him readily\r\nanticipate the greatest misfortunes; his imagination then stepped in and\r\ndepicted these misfortunes to him with the most horrible details.\r\n\r\n"Take care never to sign the letters you write to tell us what you are\r\ndoing," the Contessa warned him. "On your return you must on no account\r\ncome straight to the Lake of Como. Stop at Lugano, on Swiss soil." He\r\nwas to arrive in this little town under the name of Cavi; he would find\r\nat the principal inn the Contessa\'s footman, who would tell him what to\r\ndo. His aunt ended her letter as follows: "Take every possible\r\nprecaution to keep your mad escapade secret, and above all do not carry\r\non you any printed or written document; in Switzerland you will be\r\nsurrounded by the friends of Santa Margherita.[8] If I have enough\r\nmoney," the Contessa told him, "I shall send someone to Geneva, to the\r\nH\xc3\xb4tel des Balances, and you shall have particulars which I cannot put\r\nin writing but which you ought to know before coming here. But, in\r\nheaven\'s name, not a day longer in Paris; you will be recognised there\r\nby our spies." Fabrizio\'s imagination set to work to construct the\r\nwildest hypotheses, and he was incapable of any other pleasure save that\r\nof trying to guess what the strange information could be that his aunt\r\nhad to give him. Twice on his passage through France he was arrested,\r\nbut managed to get away; he was indebted, for these unpleasantnesses, to\r\nhis Italian passport and to that strange description of him as a dealer\r\nin barometers, which hardly seemed to tally with his youthful face and\r\nthe arm which he carried in a sling.\r\n\r\nFinally, at Geneva, he found a man in the Contessa\'s service, who gave\r\nhim a message from her to the effect that he, Fabrizio, had been\r\nreported to the police at Milan as having gone abroad to convey to\r\nNapoleon certain proposals drafted by a vast conspiracy organised in the\r\nformer Kingdom of Italy. If this had not been the object of his journey,\r\nthe report went on, why should he have gone under an assumed name? His\r\nmother was endeavouring to establish the truth, as follows:\r\n\r\n1st, that he had never gone beyond Switzerland.\r\n\r\n2ndly, that he had left the castle suddenly after a quarrel with his\r\nelder brother.\r\n\r\nOn hearing this story Fabrizio felt a thrill of pride. "I am supposed to\r\nhave been a sort of ambassador to Napoleon," he said to himself; "I\r\nshould have had the honour of speaking to that great man: would to God I\r\nhad!" He recalled that his ancestor seven generations back, a grandson\r\nof him who came to Milan in the train of the Sforza, had had the honour\r\nof having his head cut off by the Duke\'s enemies, who surprised him as\r\nhe was on his way to Switzerland to convey certain proposals to the Free\r\nCantons and to raise troops there. He saw in his mind\'s eye the print\r\nthat illustrated this exploit in the genealogy of the family. Fabrizio,\r\nquestioning the servant, found him shocked by a detail which finally he\r\nallowed to escape him, despite the express order, several times repeated\r\nto him by the Contessa, not to reveal it. It was Ascanio, his elder\r\nbrother, who had reported him to the Milan police. This cruel news\r\nalmost drove our hero out of his mind. From Geneva, in order to go to\r\nItaly, one must pass through Lausanne; he insisted on setting off at\r\nonce on foot, and thus covering ten or twelve leagues, although the mail\r\nfrom Geneva to Lausanne was starting in two hours\' time. Before leaving\r\nGeneva he picked a quarrel in one of the melancholy caf\xc3\xa9s of the place\r\nwith a young man who, he said, stared at him in a singular fashion.\r\nWhich was perfectly true: the young Genevan, phlegmatic, rational and\r\ninterested only in money, thought him mad; Fabrizio on coming in had\r\nglared furiously in all directions, then had upset the cup of coffee\r\nthat was brought to him over his breeches. In this quarrel Fabrizio\'s\r\nfirst movement was quite of the sixteenth century: instead of proposing\r\na duel to the young Genevan, he drew his dagger and rushed upon him to\r\nstab him with it. In this moment of passion, Fabrizio forgot everything\r\nhe had ever learned of the laws of honour and reverted to instinct, or,\r\nmore properly speaking, to the memories of his earliest childhood.\r\n\r\nThe confidential agent whom he found at Lugano increased his fury by\r\nfurnishing him with fresh details. As Fabrizio was beloved at Grianta,\r\nno one there had mentioned his name, and, but for his brother\'s kind\r\nintervention, everyone would have pretended to believe that he was at\r\nMilan, and the attention of the police in that city would not have been\r\ndrawn to his absence.\r\n\r\n"I expect the _doganieri_ have a description of you," his aunt\'s envoy\r\nhinted, "and if we keep to the main road, when you come to the frontier\r\nof the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom, you will be arrested."\r\n\r\nFabrizio and his party were familiar with every footpath over the\r\nmountain that divides Lugano from the Lake of Como; they disguised\r\nthemselves as hunters, that is to say as poachers, and as they were\r\nthree in number and had a fairly resolute bearing, the _doganieri_ whom\r\nthey passed gave them a greeting and nothing more. Fabrizio arranged\r\nthings so as not to arrive at the castle until nearly midnight; at that\r\nhour his father and all the powdered footmen had long been in bed. He\r\nclimbed down without difficulty into the deep moat and entered the\r\ncastle by the window of a cellar: it was there that his mother and aunt\r\nwere waiting for him; presently his sisters came running in. Transports\r\nof affection alternated with tears for some time, and they had scarcely\r\nbegun to talk reasonably when the first light of dawn came to warn these\r\npeople who thought themselves so unfortunate that time was flying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE CONSTABLES_\r\n\r\n\r\n"I hope your brother won\'t have any suspicion of your being here,"\r\nSignora Pietranera said to him; "I have scarcely spoken to him since\r\nthat fine escapade of his, and his vanity has done me the honour of\r\ntaking offence. This evening, at supper, I condescended to say a few\r\nwords to him; I had to find some excuse to hide my frantic joy, which\r\nmight have made him suspicious. Then, when I noticed that he was quite\r\nproud of this sham reconciliation, I took advantage of his happiness to\r\nmake him drink a great deal too much, and I am certain he will never\r\nhave thought of taking any steps to carry on his profession of spying."\r\n\r\n"We shall have to hide our hussar in your room," said the Marchesa, "he\r\ncan\'t leave at once; we haven\'t sufficient command of ourselves at\r\npresent to make plans, and we shall have to think out the best way of\r\nputting those terrible Milan police off the track."\r\n\r\nThis plan was adopted; but the Marchese and his elder son noticed, next\r\nday, that the Marchesa was constantly in her sister-in-law\'s room. We\r\nshall not stop to depict the transports of affection and joy which\r\ncontinued, all that day, to convulse these happy creatures. Italian\r\nhearts are, far more than ours in France, tormented by the suspicions\r\nand wild ideas which a burning imagination presents to them, but on the\r\nother hand their joys are far more intense and more lasting. On the day\r\nin question the Contessa and Marchesa were literally out of their minds;\r\nFabrizio was obliged to begin all his stories over again; finally they\r\ndecided to go away and conceal their general joy at Milan, so difficult\r\ndid it appear to be to keep it hidden any longer from the scrutiny of\r\nthe Marchese and his son Ascanio.\r\n\r\nThey took the ordinary boat of the household to go to Como; to have\r\nacted otherwise would have aroused endless suspicions. But on arriving\r\nat the harbour of Como the Marchesa remembered that she had left behind\r\nat Grianta papers of the greatest importance: she hastened to send the\r\nboatmen back for them, and so these men could give no account of how the\r\ntwo ladies were spending their time at Como. No sooner had they arrived\r\nin the town than they selected haphazard one of the carriages that ply\r\nfor hire near that tall medi\xc3\xa6val tower which rises above the Milan\r\ngate. They started off at once, without giving the coachman time to\r\nspeak to anyone. A quarter of a league from the town they found a young\r\nsportsman of their acquaintance who, out of courtesy to them as they had\r\nno man with them, kindly consented to act as their escort as far as the\r\ngates of Milan, whither he was bound for the shooting. All went well,\r\nand the ladies were conversing in the most joyous way with the young\r\ntraveller when, at a bend which the road makes to pass the charming hill\r\nand wood of San Giovanni, three constables in plain clothes sprang at\r\nthe horses\' heads. "Ah! My husband has betrayed us," cried the Marchesa,\r\nand fainted away. A serjeant who had remained a little way behind came\r\nstaggering up to the carriage and said, in a voice that reeked of the\r\n_trattoria_:\r\n\r\n"I am sorry, sir, but I must do my duty and arrest you, General Fabio\r\nConti."\r\n\r\nFabrizio thought that the serjeant was making a joke at his expense when\r\nhe addressed him as "General." "You shall pay for this!" he said to\r\nhimself. He examined the men in plain clothes and watched for a\r\nfavourable moment to jump down from the carriage and dash across the\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nThe Contessa smiled--a smile of despair, I fancy--then said to the\r\nserjeant:\r\n\r\n"But, my dear serjeant, is it this boy of sixteen that you take for\r\nGeneral Conti?"\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you the General\'s daughter?" asked the serjeant.\r\n\r\n"Look at my father," said the Contessa, pointing to Fabrizio. The\r\nconstables went into fits of laughter.\r\n\r\n"Show me your passports and don\'t argue the point," said the serjeant,\r\nstung by the general mirth.\r\n\r\n"These ladies never take passports to go to Milan," said the coachman\r\nwith a calm and philosophical air: "they are coming from their castle of\r\nGrianta. This lady is the Signora Contessa Pietranera; the other is the\r\nSignora Marchesa del Dongo."\r\n\r\nThe serjeant, completely disconcerted, went forward to the horses\' heads\r\nand there took counsel with his men. The conference had lasted for fully\r\nfive minutes when the Contessa asked if the gentlemen would kindly allow\r\nthe carriage to be moved forward a few yards and stopped in the shade;\r\nthe heat was overpowering, though it was only eleven o\'clock in the\r\nmorning. Fabrizio, who was looking out most attentively in all\r\ndirections, seeking a way of escape, saw coming out of a little path\r\nthrough the fields and on to the high road a girl of fourteen or\r\nfifteen, who was crying timidly into her handkerchief. She came forward\r\nwalking between two constables in uniform, and, three paces behind her,\r\nalso between constables, stalked a tall, lean man who assumed an air of\r\ndignity, like a Prefect following a procession.\r\n\r\n"Where did you find them?" asked the serjeant, for the moment completely\r\ndrunk.\r\n\r\n"Running away across the fields, with not a sign of a passport about\r\nthem."\r\n\r\nThe serjeant appeared to lose his head altogether; he had before him\r\nfive prisoners, instead of the two that he was expected to have. He went\r\na little way off, leaving only one man to guard the male prisoner who\r\nput on the air of majesty, and another to keep the horses from moving.\r\n\r\n"Wait," said the Contessa to Fabrizio, who had already jumped out of the\r\ncarriage. "Everything will be settled in a minute."\r\n\r\nThey heard a constable exclaim: "What does it matter! If they have no\r\npassports, they\'re fair game whoever they are." The serjeant seemed not\r\nquite so certain; the name of Contessa Pietranera made him a little\r\nuneasy: he had known the general, and had not heard of his death. "The\r\nGeneral is not the man to let it pass, if I arrest his wife without good\r\nreason," he said to himself.\r\n\r\nDuring this deliberation, which was prolonged, the Contessa had entered\r\ninto conversation with the girl, who was standing on the road, and in\r\nthe dust by the side of the carriage; she had been struck by her beauty.\r\n\r\n"The sun will be bad for you, Signorina. This gallant soldier," she went\r\non, addressing the constable who was posted at the horses\' heads, "will\r\nsurely allow you to get into the carriage."\r\n\r\nFabrizio, who was wandering round the vehicle, came up to help the girl\r\nto get in. Her foot was already on the step, her arm supported by\r\nFabrizio, when the imposing man, who was six yards behind the carriage,\r\ncalled out in a voice magnified by the desire to preserve his dignity:\r\n\r\n"Stay in the road; don\'t get into a carriage that does not belong to\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\nFabrizio had not heard this order; the girl, instead of climbing into\r\nthe carriage, tried to get down again, and, as Fabrizio continued to\r\nhold her up, fell into his arms. He smiled; she blushed a deep crimson;\r\nthey stood for a moment looking at one another after the girl had\r\ndisengaged herself from his arms.\r\n\r\n"She would be a charming prison companion," Fabrizio said to himself.\r\n"What profound thought lies behind that brow! She would know how to\r\nlove."\r\n\r\nThe serjeant came up to them with an air of authority: "Which of these\r\nladies is named Clelia Conti?"\r\n\r\n"I am," said the girl.\r\n\r\n"And I," cried the elderly man, "am General Fabio Conti, Chamberlain to\r\nH.S.H. the Prince of Parma; I consider it most irregular that a man in\r\nmy position should be hunted down like a thief."\r\n\r\n"The day before yesterday, when you embarked at the harbour of Como, did\r\nyou not tell the police inspector who asked for your passport to go\r\naway? Very well, his orders to-day are that you are not to go away."\r\n\r\n"I had already pushed off my boat, I was in a hurry, there was a storm\r\nthreatening, a man not in uniform shouted to me from the quay to put\r\nback into harbour, I told him my name and went on."\r\n\r\n"And this morning you escaped from Como."\r\n\r\n"A man like myself does not take a passport when he goes from Milan to\r\nvisit the lake. This morning, at Como, I was told that I should be\r\narrested at the gate. I left the town on foot with my daughter; I hoped\r\nto find on the road some carriage that would take me to Milan, where the\r\nfirst thing I shall do will certainly be to call on the General\r\nCommanding the Province and lodge a complaint."\r\n\r\nA heavy weight seemed to have been lifted from the serjeant\'s mind.\r\n\r\n"Very well, General, you are under arrest and I shall take you to Milan.\r\nAnd you, who are you?" he said to Fabrizio.\r\n\r\n"My son," replied the Contessa; "Ascanio, son of the Divisional General\r\nPietranera."\r\n\r\n"Without a passport, Signora Contessa?" said the serjeant, in a much\r\ngentler tone.\r\n\r\n"At his age, he has never had one; he never travels alone, he is always\r\nwith me."\r\n\r\nDuring this colloquy General Conti was standing more and more on his\r\ndignity with the constables.\r\n\r\n"Not so much talk," said one of them; "you are under arrest, that\'s\r\nenough!"\r\n\r\n"You will be glad to hear," said the serjeant, "that we allow you to\r\nhire a horse from some _contadino_; otherwise, never mind all the dust\r\nand the heat and the Chamberlain of Parma, you would have to put your\r\nbest foot foremost to keep pace with our horses."\r\n\r\nThe General began to swear.\r\n\r\n"Will you kindly be quiet!" the constable repeated. "Where is your\r\ngeneral\'s uniform? Anybody can come along and say he\'s a general."\r\n\r\nThe General grew more and more angry. Meanwhile things were looking much\r\nbrighter in the carriage.\r\n\r\nThe Contessa kept the constables running about as if they had been her\r\nservants. She had given a scudo to one of them to go and fetch wine,\r\nand, what was better still, cold water from a cottage that was visible\r\ntwo hundred yards away. She had found time to calm Fabrizio, who was\r\ndetermined, at all costs, to make a dash for the wood that covered the\r\nhill. "I have a good brace of pistols," he said. She obtained the\r\ninfuriated General\'s permission for his daughter to get into the\r\ncarriage. On this occasion the General, who loved to talk about himself\r\nand his family, told the ladies that his daughter was only twelve years\r\nold, having been born in 1803, on the 27th of October, but that, such\r\nwas her intelligence, everyone took her to be fourteen or fifteen.\r\n\r\n"A thoroughly common man," the Contessa\'s eyes signalled to the\r\nMarchesa. Thanks to the Contessa, everything was settled, after a\r\ncolloquy that lasted an hour. A constable, who discovered that he had\r\nsome business to do in the neighbouring village, lent his horse to\r\nGeneral Conti, after the Contessa had said to him: "You shall have ten\r\nfrancs." The serjeant went off by himself with the General; the other\r\nconstables stayed behind under a tree, accompanied by four huge bottles\r\nof wine, almost small demi-johns, which the one who had been sent to the\r\ncottage had brought back, with the help of a _contadino_, Clelia Conti\r\nwas authorised by the proud Chamberlain to accept, for the return\r\njourney to Milan, a seat in the ladies\' carriage, and no one dreamed of\r\narresting the son of the gallant General Pietranera. After the first few\r\nminutes had been devoted to an exchange of courtesies and to remarks on\r\nthe little incident that had just occurred, Clelia Conti observed the\r\nnote of enthusiasm with which so beautiful a lady as the Contessa spoke\r\nto Fabrizio; certainly, she was not his mother. The girl\'s attention was\r\ncaught most of all by repeated allusions to something heroic, bold,\r\ndangerous to the last degree, which he had recently done; but for all\r\nher cleverness little Clelia could not discover what this was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE POLICE_\r\n\r\n\r\nShe gazed with astonishment at this young hero whose eyes seemed to be\r\nblazing still with all the fire of action. For his part, he was somewhat\r\nembarrassed by the remarkable beauty of this girl of twelve, and her\r\nsteady gaze made him blush.\r\n\r\nA league outside Milan Fabrizio announced that he was going to see his\r\nuncle, and took leave of the ladies.\r\n\r\n"If I ever get out of my difficulties," he said to Clelia, "I shall pay\r\na visit to the beautiful pictures at Parma, and then will you deign to\r\nremember the name: Fabrizio del Dongo?"\r\n\r\n"Good!" said the Contessa, "that is how you keep your identity secret.\r\nSignorina, deign to remember that this scapegrace is my son, and is\r\ncalled Pietranera, and not del Dongo."\r\n\r\nThat evening, at a late hour, Fabrizio entered Milan by the Porta Renza,\r\nwhich leads to a fashionable gathering-place. The dispatch of their two\r\nservants to Switzerland had exhausted the very modest savings of the\r\nMarchesa and her sister-in-law; fortunately, Fabrizio had still some\r\nnapoleons left, and one of the diamonds, which they decided to sell.\r\n\r\nThe ladies were highly popular, and knew everyone in the town. The most\r\nimportant personages in the Austrian and religious party went to speak\r\non behalf of Fabrizio to Barone Binder, the Chief of Police. These\r\ngentlemen could not conceive, they said, how anyone could take seriously\r\nthe escapade of a boy of sixteen who left the paternal roof after a\r\ndispute with an elder brother.\r\n\r\n"My business is to take everything seriously," replied Barone Binder\r\ngently; a wise and solemn man, he was then engaged in forming the Milan\r\npolice, and had undertaken to prevent a revolution like that of 1746,\r\nwhich drove the Austrians from Genoa. This Milan police, since rendered\r\nso famous by the adventures of Silvio Pellico and M. Andryane, was not\r\nexactly cruel; it carried out, reasonably and without pity, harsh laws.\r\nThe Emperor Francis II wished these overbold Italian imaginations to be\r\nstruck by terror.\r\n\r\n"Give me, day by day," repeated Barone Binder to Fabrizio\'s protectors,\r\n"a _certified_ account of what the young Marchesino del Dongo has been\r\ndoing; let us follow him from the moment of his departure on the 8th of\r\nMarch to his arrival last night in this city, where he is hidden in one\r\nof the rooms of his mother\'s apartment, and I am prepared to treat him\r\nas the most well-disposed and most frolicsome young man in town. If you\r\ncannot furnish me with the young man\'s itinerary during all the days\r\nfollowing his departure from Grianta, however exalted his birth may be,\r\nhowever great the respect I owe to the friends of his family, obviously\r\nit is my duty to order his arrest. Am I not bound to keep him in prison\r\nuntil he has furnished me with proofs that he did not go to convey a\r\nmessage to Napoleon from such disaffected persons as may exist in\r\nLombardy among the subjects of His Imperial and Royal Majesty? Note\r\nfarther, gentlemen, that if young del Dongo succeeds in justifying\r\nhimself on this point, he will still be liable to be charged with having\r\ngone abroad without a passport properly issued to himself, and also with\r\nassuming a false name and deliberately making use of a passport issued\r\nto a common workman, that is to say to a person of a class greatly\r\ninferior to that to which he himself belongs."\r\n\r\nThis declaration, cruelly reasonable, was accompanied by all the marks\r\nof deference and respect which the Chief of Police owed to the high\r\nposition of the Marchesa del Dongo and of the important personages who\r\nwere intervening on her behalf.\r\n\r\nThe Marchesa was in despair when Barone Binder\'s reply was communicated\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n"Fabrizio will be arrested," she sobbed, "and once he is in prison, God\r\nknows when he will get out! His father will disown him!"\r\n\r\nSignora Pietranera and her sister-in-law took counsel with two or three\r\nintimate friends, and, in spite of anything these might say, the\r\nMarchesa was absolutely determined to send her son away that very night.\r\n\r\n"But you can see quite well," the Contessa pointed out to her, "that\r\nBarone Binder knows that your son is here; he is not a bad man."\r\n\r\n"No; but he is anxious to please the Emperor Francis."\r\n\r\n"But, if he thought it would lead to his promotion to put Fabrizio in\r\nprison, the boy would be there now; it is showing an insulting defiance\r\nof the Barone to send him away."\r\n\r\n"But his admission to us that he knows where Fabrizio is, is as much as\r\nto say: \'Send him away!\' No, I shan\'t feel alive until I can no longer\r\nsay to myself: \'In a quarter of an hour my son may be within prison\r\nwalls.\' Whatever Barone Binder\'s ambition may be," the Marchesa went on,\r\n"he thinks it useful to his personal standing in this country to make\r\ncertain concessions to oblige a man of my husband\'s rank, and I see a\r\nproof of this in the singular frankness with which he admits that he\r\nknows where to lay hands on my son. Besides, the Barone has been so kind\r\nas to let us know the two offences with which Fabrizio is charged, at\r\nthe instigation of his unworthy brother; he explains that each of these\r\noffences means prison: is not that as much as to say that if we prefer\r\nexile it is for us to choose?"\r\n\r\n"If you choose exile," the Contessa kept on repeating, "we shall never\r\nset eyes on him again as long as we live." Fabrizio, who was present at\r\nthe whole conversation, with an old friend of the Marchesa, now a\r\ncounsellor on the tribunal set up by Austria, was strongly inclined to\r\ntake the key of the street and go; and, as a matter of fact, that same\r\nevening he left the _palazzo_, hidden in the carriage that was taking\r\nhis mother and aunt to the Scala theatre. The coachman, whom they\r\ndistrusted, went as usual to wait in an _osteria_, and while the\r\nfootmen, on whom they could rely, were looking after the horses,\r\nFabrizio, disguised as a _contadino_, slipped out of the carriage and\r\nescaped from the town. Next morning he crossed the frontier with equal\r\nease, and a few hours later had established himself on a property which\r\nhis mother owned in Piedmont, near Novara, to be precise, at Romagnano,\r\nwhere Bayard was killed.\r\n\r\nIt may be imagined how much attention the ladies, on reaching their box\r\nin the Scala, paid to the performance. They had gone there solely to be\r\nable to consult certain of their friends who belonged to the Liberal\r\nparty and whose appearance at the _palazzo_ del Dongo might have been\r\nmisconstrued by the police. In the box it was decided to make a fresh\r\nappeal to Barone Binder. There was no question of offering a sum of\r\nmoney to this magistrate who was a perfectly honest man; moreover, the\r\nladies were extremely poor; they had forced Fabrizio to take with him\r\nall the money that remained from the sale of the diamond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE CANON_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was of the utmost importance that they should be kept constantly\r\ninformed of the Barone\'s latest decisions. The Contessa\'s friends\r\nreminded her of a certain Canon Borda, a most charming young man who at\r\none time had tried to make advances to her, in a somewhat violent\r\nmanner; finding himself unsuccessful he had reported her friendship for\r\nLimercati to General Pietranera, whereupon he had been dismissed from\r\nthe house as a rascal. Now, at present this Canon was in the habit of\r\ngoing every evening to play _tarocchi_ with Baronessa Binder, and was\r\nnaturally the intimate friend of her husband. The Contessa made up her\r\nmind to take the horribly unpleasant step of going to see this Canon;\r\nand the following morning, at an early hour, before he had left the\r\nhouse, she sent in her name.\r\n\r\nWhen the Canon\'s one and only servant announced: "Contessa Pietranera,"\r\nhis master was so overcome as to be incapable of speech; he made no\r\nattempt to repair the disorder of a very scanty attire.\r\n\r\n"Shew her in, and leave us," he said in faint accents. The Contessa\r\nentered the room; Borda fell on his knees.\r\n\r\n"It is in this position that an unhappy madman ought to receive your\r\norders," he said to the Contessa who that morning, in a plain costume\r\nthat was almost a disguise, was irresistibly attractive. Her intense\r\ngrief at Fabrizio\'s exile, the violence that she was doing to her own\r\nfeelings in coming to the house of a man who had behaved treacherously\r\ntowards her, all combined to give an incredible brilliance to her eyes.\r\n\r\n"It is in this position that I wish to receive your orders," cried the\r\nCanon, "for it is obvious that you have some service to ask of me,\r\notherwise you would not have honoured with your presence the poor\r\ndwelling of an unhappy madman; once before, carried away by love and\r\njealousy, he behaved towards you like a scoundrel, as soon as he saw\r\nthat he could not win your favour."\r\n\r\nThese words were sincere, and all the more handsome in that the Canon\r\nnow enjoyed a position of great power; the Contessa was moved to tears\r\nby them; humiliation and fear had frozen her spirit; now in a moment\r\naffection and a gleam of hope took their place. From a most unhappy\r\nstate she passed in a flash almost to happiness.\r\n\r\n"Kiss my hand," she said, as she held it out to the Canon, "and rise."\r\n(She used the second person singular, which in Italy, it must be\r\nremembered, indicates a sincere and open friendship just as much as a\r\nmore tender sentiment.) "I have come to ask your favour for my nephew\r\nFabrizio. This is the whole truth of the story without the slightest\r\nconcealment, as one tells it to an old friend. At the age of sixteen and\r\na half he has done an intensely stupid thing. We were at the castle of\r\nGrianta on the Lake of Como. One evening at seven o\'clock we learned by\r\na boat from Como of the Emperor\'s landing on the shore of the Gulf of\r\nJuan. Next morning Fabrizio went off to France, after borrowing the\r\npassport of one of his plebeian friends, a dealer in barometers, named\r\nVasi. As he does not exactly resemble a dealer in barometers, he had\r\nhardly gone ten leagues into France when he was arrested on sight; his\r\noutbursts of enthusiasm in bad French seemed suspicious. After a\r\ntime he escaped and managed to reach Geneva; we sent to meet him\r\nat Lugano. . . ."\r\n\r\n"That is to say, Geneva," put in the Canon with a smile.\r\n\r\nThe Contessa finished her story.\r\n\r\n"I will do everything for you that is humanly possible," replied the\r\nCanon effusively; "I place myself entirely at your disposal. I will even\r\ndo imprudent things," he added. "Tell me, what am I to do as soon as\r\nthis poor parlour is deprived of this heavenly apparition which marks an\r\nepoch in the history of my life?"\r\n\r\n"You must go to Barone Binder and tell him that you have loved Fabrizio\r\never since he was born, that you saw him in his cradle when you used to\r\ncome to our house, and that accordingly, in the name of the friendship\r\nhe has shown for you, you beg him to employ all his spies to discover\r\nwhether, before his departure for Switzerland, Fabrizio was in any sort\r\nof communication whatsoever with any of the Liberals whom he has under\r\nsupervision. If the Barone\'s information is of any value, he is bound to\r\nsee that there is nothing more in this than a piece of boyish folly. You\r\nknow that I used to have, in my beautiful apartment in the _palazzo_\r\nDugnani, prints of the battles won by Napoleon: it was by spelling out\r\nthe legends engraved beneath them that my nephew learned to read. When\r\nhe was five years old, my poor husband used to explain these battles to\r\nhim; we put my husband\'s helmet on his head, the boy strutted about\r\ntrailing his big sabre. Very well, one fine day he learns that my\r\nhusband\'s god, the Emperor, has returned to France, he starts out to\r\njoin him, like a fool, but does not succeed in reaching him. Ask your\r\nBarone with what penalty he proposes to punish this moment of folly?"\r\n\r\n"I was forgetting one thing," said the Canon, "you shall see that I am\r\nnot altogether unworthy of the pardon that you grant me. Here," he said,\r\nlooking on the table among his papers, "here is the accusation by that\r\ninfamous _collo-torto_" (that is, hypocrite), "see, signed Ascanio\r\nValserra del Dongo, which gave rise to the whole trouble; I found it\r\nyesterday at the police headquarters, and went to the Scala in the hope\r\nof finding someone who was in the habit of going to your box, through\r\nwhom I might be able to communicate it to you. A copy of this document\r\nreached Vienna long ago. There is the enemy that we have to fight." The\r\nCanon read the accusation through with the Contessa, and it was agreed\r\nthat in the course of the day he would let her have a copy by the hand\r\nof some trustworthy person. It was with joy in her heart that the\r\nContessa returned to the _palazzo_ del Dongo.\r\n\r\n"No one could possibly be more of a gentleman than that reformed rake,"\r\nshe told the Marchesa. "This evening at the Scala, at a quarter to\r\neleven by the theatre clock, we are to send everyone away from our box,\r\nput out the candles, and shut our door, and at eleven the Canon himself\r\nwill come and tell us what he has managed to do. We decided that this\r\nwould be the least compromising course for him."\r\n\r\nThis Canon was a man of spirit; he was careful to keep the appointment;\r\nhe shewed when he came a complete good nature and an unreserved openness\r\nof heart such as are scarcely to be found except in countries where\r\nvanity does not predominate over every other sentiment. His denunciation\r\nof the Contessa to her husband, General Pietranera, was one of the great\r\nsorrows of his life, and he had now found a means of getting rid of that\r\nremorse.\r\n\r\nThat morning, when the Contessa had left his room, "So she\'s in love\r\nwith her nephew, is she," he had said to himself bitterly, for he was by\r\nno means cured. "With her pride, to have come to me! . . . After that\r\npoor Pietranera died, she repulsed with horror my offers of service,\r\nthough they were most polite and admirably presented by Colonel Scotti,\r\nher old lover. The beautiful Pietranera reduced to living on fifteen\r\nhundred francs!" the Canon went on, striding vigorously up and down the\r\nroom. "And then to go and live in the castle of Grianta, with an\r\nabominable _seccatore_ like that Marchese del Dongo! . . . I can see it\r\nall now! After all, that young Fabrizio is full of charm, tall, well\r\nbuilt, always with a smile on his face . . . and, better still, a\r\ndeliciously voluptuous expression in his eye . . . a Correggio face,"\r\nthe Canon added bitterly.\r\n\r\n"The difference in age . . . not too great . . . Fabrizio born after the\r\nFrench came, about \'98, I fancy; the Contessa might be twenty-seven or\r\ntwenty-eight: no one could be better looking, more adorable. In this\r\ncountry rich in beauties, she defeats them all, the Marini, the\r\nGherardi, the Ruga, the Aresi, the Pietragrua, she is far and away above\r\nany of them. They were living happily together, hidden away by that\r\nbeautiful Lake of Como, when the young man took it into his head to join\r\nNapoleon. . . . There are still souls in Italy! In spite of everything!\r\nDear country! No," went on this heart inflamed by jealousy, "impossible\r\nto explain in any other way her resigning herself to vegetating in the\r\ncountry, with the disgusting spectacle, day after day, at every meal, of\r\nthat horrible face of the Marchese del Dongo, as well as that\r\nunspeakable pasty physiognomy of the Marchesino Ascanio, who is going to\r\nbe worse than his father! Well, I shall serve her faithfully. At least I\r\nshall have the pleasure of seeing her otherwise than through an\r\nopera-glass."\r\n\r\nCanon Borda explained the whole case very clearly to the ladies. At\r\nheart, Binder was as well-disposed as they could wish; he was delighted\r\nthat Fabrizio should have taken the key of the street before any orders\r\ncould arrive from Vienna; for Barone Binder had no power to make any\r\ndecision, he awaited orders in this case as in every other. He sent\r\nevery day to Vienna an exact copy of all the information that reached\r\nhim; then he waited.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary that, in his exile at Romagnano, Fabrizio\r\n\r\n(1) Should hear mass daily without fail, take as his confessor a man of\r\nspirit, devoted to the cause of the Monarchy, and should confess to him,\r\nat the tribunal of penitence, only the most irreproachable sentiments.\r\n\r\n(2) Should consort with no one who bore any reputation for intelligence,\r\nand, were the need to arise, must speak of rebellion with horror as a\r\nthing that no circumstances could justify.\r\n\r\n(3) Must never let himself be seen in the _caff\xc3\xa8_, must never read any\r\nnewspaper other than the official _Gazette_ of Turin and Milan; in\r\ngeneral he should shew a distaste for reading, and never open any book\r\nprinted later than 1720, with the possible exception of the novels of\r\nWalter Scott.\r\n\r\n(4) "Finally" (the Canon added with a touch of malice), "it is most\r\nimportant that he should pay court openly to one of the pretty women of\r\nthe district, of the noble class, of course; this will shew that he has\r\nnot the dark and dissatisfied mind of an embryo conspirator."\r\n\r\nBefore going to bed, the Contessa and the Marchesa each wrote Fabrizio\r\nan endless letter, in which they explained to him with a charming\r\nanxiety all the advice that had been given them by Borda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE POLICE_\r\n\r\n\r\nFabrizio had no wish to be a conspirator: he loved Napoleon, and, in his\r\ncapacity as a young noble, believed that he had been created to be\r\nhappier than his neighbour, and thought the middle classes absurd. Never\r\nhad he opened a book since leaving school, where he had read only texts\r\narranged by the Jesuits. He established himself at some distance from\r\nRomagnano, in a magnificent _palazzo_, one of the masterpieces of the\r\nfamous architect Sanmicheli; but for thirty years it had been\r\nuninhabited, so that the rain came into every room and not one of the\r\nwindows would shut. He took possession of the agent\'s horses, which he\r\nrode without ceremony at all hours of the day; he never spoke, and he\r\nthought about things. The recommendation to take a mistress from an\r\n_ultra_ family appealed to him, and he obeyed it to the letter. He chose\r\nas his confessor a young priest given to intrigue who wished to become a\r\nbishop (like the confessor of the Spielberg[9]); but he went three\r\nleagues on foot and wrapped himself in a mystery which he imagined to be\r\nimpenetrable, in order to read the _Constitutionnel_, which he thought\r\nsublime. "It is as fine as Alfieri and Dante!" he used often to exclaim.\r\nFabrizio had this in common with the young men of France, that he was\r\nfar more seriously taken up with his horse and his newspaper than with\r\nhis politically _sound_ mistress. But there was no room as yet for\r\n_imitation of others_ in this simple and sturdy nature, and he made no\r\nfriends in the society of the large country town of Romagnano; his\r\nsimplicity passed as arrogance: no one knew what to make of his\r\ncharacter. "_He is a younger son who feels himself wronged because he is\r\nnot the eldest_" was the _parroco\'s_ comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Silvio Pellico has given this name a European notoriety:\r\nit is that of the street in Milan in which the police headquarters\r\nand prisons are situated.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: See the curious Memoirs of M. Andryane, as entertaining\r\nas a novel, and as lasting as Tacitus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us admit frankly that Canon Borda\'s jealousy was not altogether\r\nunfounded: on his return from France, Fabrizio appeared to the eyes of\r\nContessa Pietranera like a handsome stranger whom she had known well in\r\ndays gone by. If he had spoken to her of love she would have loved him;\r\nhad she not already conceived, for his conduct and his person, a\r\npassionate and, one might say, unbounded admiration? But Fabrizio\r\nembraced her with such an effusion of innocent gratitude and\r\ngood-fellowship that she would have been horrified with herself had she\r\nsought for any other sentiment in this almost filial friendship. "After\r\nall," she said to herself, "some of my friends who knew me six years\r\nago, at Prince Eug\xc3\xa8ne\'s court, may still find me good-looking and even\r\nyoung, but for him I am a respectable woman--and, if the truth must be\r\ntold without any regard for my vanity, a woman of a certain age." The\r\nContessa was under an illusion as to the period of life at which she had\r\narrived, but it was not the illusion of common women. "Besides, at his\r\nage," she went on, "boys are apt to exaggerate the ravages of time. A\r\nman with more experience of life . . ."\r\n\r\nThe Contessa, who was pacing the floor of her drawing-room, stopped\r\nbefore a mirror, then smiled. It must be explained that, some months\r\nsince, the heart of Signora Pietranera had been attacked in a serious\r\nfashion, and by a singular personage. Shortly after Fabrizio\'s departure\r\nfor France, the Contessa who, without altogether admitting it to\r\nherself, was already beginning to take a great interest in him, had\r\nfallen into a profound melancholy. All her occupations seemed to her to\r\nlack pleasure, and, if one may use the word, savour; she told herself\r\nthat Napoleon, wishing to secure the attachment of his Italian peoples,\r\nwould take Fabrizio as his aide-de-camp. "He is lost to me!" she\r\nexclaimed, weeping, "I shall never see him again; he will write to me,\r\nbut what shall I be to him in ten years\' time?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_MELANCHOLY_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in this frame of mind that she made an expedition to Milan; she\r\nhoped to find there some more immediate news of Napoleon, and, for all\r\nshe knew, incidentally news of Fabrizio. Without admitting it to\r\nherself, this active soul was beginning to be very weary of the\r\nmonotonous life she was leading in the country. "It is a postponement of\r\ndeath," she said to herself, "it is not life." Every day to see those\r\npowdered heads, her brother, her nephew Ascanio, their footmen! What\r\nwould her excursions on the lake be without Fabrizio? Her sole\r\nconsolation was based on the ties of friendship that bound her to the\r\nMarchesa. But for some time now this intimacy with Fabrizio\'s mother, a\r\nwoman older than herself and with no hope left in life, had begun to be\r\nless attractive to her.\r\n\r\nSuch was the singular position in which Signora Pietranera was placed:\r\nwith Fabrizio away, she had little hope for the future. Her heart was in\r\nneed of consolation and novelty. On arriving in Milan she conceived a\r\npassion for the fashionable opera; she would go and shut herself up\r\nalone for hours on end, at the Scala, in the box of her old friend\r\nGeneral Scotti. The men whom she tried to meet in order to obtain news\r\nof Napoleon and his army seemed to her vulgar and coarse. Going home,\r\nshe would improvise on her piano until three o\'clock in the morning. One\r\nevening, at the Scala, in the box of one of her friends to which she had\r\ngone in search of news from France, she made the acquaintance of Conte\r\nMosca, a Minister from Parma; he was an agreeable man who spoke of\r\nFrance and Napoleon in a way that gave her fresh reasons for hope or\r\nfear. She returned to the same box the following evening; this\r\nintelligent man reappeared and throughout the whole performance she\r\ntalked to him with enjoyment. Since Fabrizio\'s departure she had not\r\nfound any evening so lively. This man who amused her, Conte Mosca della\r\nRovere Sorezana, was at that time Minister of Police and Finance to that\r\nfamous Prince of Parma, Ernesto IV, so notorious for his severities,\r\nwhich the Liberals of Milan called cruelties. Mosca might have been\r\nforty or forty-five; he had strongly marked features, with no trace of\r\nself-importance, and a simple and light-hearted manner which was greatly\r\nin his favour; he would have looked very well indeed, if a whim on the\r\npart of his Prince had not obliged him to wear powder on his hair as a\r\nproof of his soundness in politics. As people have little fear of\r\nwounding one another\'s vanity, they quickly arrive in Italy at a tone of\r\nintimacy, and make personal observations. The antidote to this practice\r\nis not to see the other person again if one\'s feelings have been hurt.\r\n\r\n"Tell me, Conte, why do you powder your hair?" Signora Pietranera asked\r\nhim at their third meeting. "Powder! A man like you, attractive, still\r\nyoung, who fought on our side in Spain!"\r\n\r\n"Because, in the said Spain, I stole nothing, and one must live. I was\r\nathirst for glory; a flattering word from the French General, Gouvion\r\nSaint-Cyr, who commanded us, was everything to me then. When Napoleon\r\nfell, it so happened that while I was eating up my patrimony in his\r\nservice, my father, a man of imagination, who pictured me as a general\r\nalready, had been building me a _palazzo_ at Parma. In 1813 I found that\r\nmy whole worldly wealth consisted of a huge _palazzo_, half-finished,\r\nand a pension."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A MINISTER_\r\n\r\n\r\n"A pension: 3,500 francs, like my husband\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Conte Pietranera commanded a Division. My pension, as a humble squadron\r\ncommander, has never been more than 800 francs, and even that has been\r\npaid to me only since I became Minister of Finance."\r\n\r\nAs there was nobody else in the box but the lady of extremely liberal\r\nviews to whom it belonged, the conversation continued with the same\r\nfrankness. Conte Mosca, when questioned, spoke of his life at Parma. "In\r\nSpain, under General Saint-Cyr, I faced the enemy\'s fire to win a cross\r\nand a little glory besides, now I dress myself up like an actor in a\r\nfarce to win a great social position and a few thousand francs a year.\r\nOnce I had started on this sort of political chessboard, stung by the\r\ninsolence of my superiors, I determined to occupy one of the foremost\r\nposts; I have reached it. But the happiest days of my life will always\r\nbe those which, now and again, I manage to spend at Milan; here, it\r\nseems to me, there still survives the spirit of your Army of Italy."\r\n\r\nThe frankness, the _disinvoltura_ with which this Minister of so dreaded\r\na Prince spoke pricked the Contessa\'s curiosity; from his title she had\r\nexpected to find a pedant filled with self-importance; what she saw was\r\na man who was ashamed of the gravity of his position. Mosca had promised\r\nto let her have all the news from France that he could collect; this was\r\na grave indiscretion at Milan, during the month that preceded Waterloo;\r\nthe question for Italy at that time was to be or not to be; everyone at\r\nMilan was in a fever, a fever of hope or fear. Amid this universal\r\ndisturbance, the Contessa started to make inquiries about a man who\r\nspoke thus lightly of so coveted a position, and one which, moreover,\r\nwas his sole means of livelihood.\r\n\r\nCertain curious information of an interesting oddity was reported to\r\nSignora Pietranera. "Conte Mosca della Rovere Sorezana," she was told,\r\n"is on the point of becoming Prime Minister and declared favourite of\r\nRanuccio-Ernesto IV, the absolute sovereign of Parma and one of the\r\nwealthiest Princes in Europe to boot. The Conte would already have\r\nattained to this exalted position if he had cared to shew a more solemn\r\nface: they say that the Prince often lectures him on this failing.\r\n\r\n"\'What do my manners matter to Your Highness,\' he answers boldly, \'so\r\nlong as I conduct his affairs?\'\r\n\r\n"This favourite\'s bed of roses," her informant went on, "is not without\r\nits thorns. He has to please a Sovereign, a man of sense and\r\nintelligence, no doubt, but a man who, since his accession to an\r\nabsolute throne, seems to have lost his head altogether and shews, for\r\ninstance, suspicions worthy of an old woman.\r\n\r\n"Ernesto IV is courageous only in war. On the field of battle he has\r\nbeen seen a score of times leading a column to the attack like a gallant\r\ngeneral; but after the death of his father Ernesto III, on his return to\r\nhis States, where, unfortunately for him, he possesses unlimited power,\r\nhe set to work to inveigh in the most senseless fashion against Liberals\r\nand liberty. Presently he began to imagine that he was hated; finally,\r\nin a moment of ill temper, he had two Liberals hanged, who may or may\r\nnot have been guilty, acting on the advice of a wretch called Rassi, a\r\nsort of Minister of Justice.\r\n\r\n"From that fatal moment the Prince\'s life changed; we find him tormented\r\nby the strangest suspicions. He is not fifty, and fear has so reduced\r\nhim, if one may use the expression, that whenever he speaks of Jacobins,\r\nand the plans of the Central Committee in Paris, his face becomes like\r\nthat of an old man of eighty; he relapses into the fantastic fears of\r\nchildhood. His favourite Rassi, the Fiscal General (or Chief Justice),\r\nhas no influence except through his master\'s fear; and whenever he is\r\nalarmed for his own position, he makes haste to discover some fresh\r\nconspiracy of the blackest and most fantastic order. Thirty rash fellows\r\nhave banded themselves together to read a number of the\r\n_Constitutionnel_, Rassi declares them to be conspirators, and sends\r\nthem off to prison in that famous Citadel of Parma, the terror of the\r\nwhole of Lombardy. As it rises to a great height, a hundred and eighty\r\nfeet, people say, it is visible from a long way off in the middle of\r\nthat immense plain; and the physical outlines of the prison, of which\r\nhorrible things are reported, makes it the queen, governing by fear, of\r\nthe whole of that plain, which extends from Milan to Bologna."\r\n\r\n"Would you believe," said another traveller to the Contessa, "that at\r\nnight, on the third floor of his palace, guarded by eighty sentinels who\r\nevery quarter of an hour cry aloud a whole sentence, Ernesto IV trembles\r\nin his room. All the doors fastened with ten bolts, and the adjoining\r\nrooms, above as well as below him, packed with soldiers, he is afraid of\r\nthe Jacobins. If a plank creaks in the floor, he snatches up his pistols\r\nand imagines there is a Liberal hiding under his bed. At once all the\r\nbells in the castle are set ringing, and an aide-de-camp goes to awaken\r\nConte Mosca. On reaching the castle, the Minister of Police takes good\r\ncare not to deny the existence of any conspiracy; on the contrary, alone\r\nwith the Prince, and armed to the teeth, he inspects every corner of the\r\nrooms, looks under the beds, and, in a word, gives himself up to a whole\r\nheap of ridiculous actions worthy of an old woman. All these precautions\r\nwould have seemed highly degrading to the Prince himself in the happy\r\ndays when he used to go to war and had never killed anyone except in\r\nopen combat. As he is a man of infinite spirit, he is ashamed of these\r\nprecautions; they seem to him ridiculous, even at the moment when he is\r\ngiving way to them, and the source of Conte Mosca\'s enormous reputation\r\nis that he devotes all his skill to arranging that the Prince shall\r\nnever have occasion to blush in his presence. It is he, Mosca, who, in\r\nhis capacity as Minister of Police, insists upon looking under the\r\nfurniture, and, so people say in Parma, even in the cases in which the\r\nmusicians keep their double-basses. It is the Prince who objects to this\r\nand teases his Minister over his excessive punctiliousness. \'It is a\r\nchallenge,\' Conte Mosca replies; \'think of the satirical sonnets the\r\nJacobins would shower on us if we allowed you to be killed. It is not\r\nonly your life that we are defending, it is our honour.\' But it appears\r\nthat the Prince is only half taken in by this, for if anyone in the town\r\nshould take it into his head to remark that they have passed a sleepless\r\nnight at the castle, the Grand Fiscal Rassi sends the impertinent fellow\r\nto the citadel, and once in that lofty abode, and in the _fresh air_, as\r\nthey say at Parma, it is a miracle if anyone remembers the prisoner\'s\r\nexistence. It is because he is a soldier, and in Spain got away a score\r\nof times, pistol in hand, from a tight corner, that the Prince prefers\r\nConte Mosca to Rassi, who is a great deal more flexible and baser. Those\r\nunfortunate prisoners in the citadel are kept in the most rigorously\r\nsecret confinement, and all sorts of stories are told about them. The\r\nLiberals assert that (and this, they say, is one of Rassi\'s ideas) the\r\ngaolers and confessors are under orders to assure them, about once a\r\nmonth, that one of them is being led out to die. That day the prisoners\r\nhave permission to climb to the platform of the huge tower, one hundred\r\nand eighty feet high, and from there they see a procession file along\r\nthe plain with some spy who plays the part of a poor devil going to his\r\ndeath."\r\n\r\nThese stories and a score of others of the same nature and of no less\r\nauthenticity keenly interested Signora Pietranera: on the following day\r\nshe asked Conte Mosca, whom she rallied briskly, for details. She found\r\nhim amusing, and maintained to him that at heart he was a monster\r\nwithout knowing it. One day as he went back to his inn the Conte said to\r\nhimself: "Not only is this Contessa Pietranera a charming woman; but\r\nwhen I spend the evening in her box I manage to forget certain things at\r\nParma the memory of which cuts me to the heart."--This Minister, in\r\nspite of his frivolous air and his polished manners, was not blessed\r\nwith a soul of the French type; he could not _forget_ the things that\r\nannoyed him. When there was a thorn in his pillow, he was obliged to\r\nbreak it off and to blunt its point by repeated stabbings of his\r\nthrobbing limbs. (I must apologise for the last two sentences, which are\r\ntranslated from the Italian.) On the morrow of this discovery, the Conte\r\nfound that, notwithstanding the business that had summoned him to Milan,\r\nthe day spun itself out to an enormous length; he could not stay in one\r\nplace, he wore out his carriage-horses. About six o\'clock he mounted his\r\nsaddle-horse to ride to the _Corso_; he had some hope of meeting Signora\r\nPietranera there; seeing no sign of her, he remembered that at eight\r\no\'clock the Scala Theatre opened; he entered it, and did not see ten\r\npersons in that immense auditorium. He felt somewhat ashamed of himself\r\nfor being there. "Is it possible," he asked himself, "that at forty-five\r\nand past I am committing follies at which a sub-lieutenant would blush?\r\nFortunately nobody suspects them." He fled, and tried to pass the time\r\nby strolling up and down the attractive streets that surround the Scala.\r\nThey are lined with _caff\xc3\xa8_ which at that hour are filled to overflowing\r\nwith people. Outside each of these _caff\xc3\xa8_ crowds of curious idlers\r\nperched on chairs in the middle of the street sip ices and criticise the\r\npassers-by. The Conte was a passer-by of importance; at once he had the\r\npleasure of being recognised and addressed. Three or four importunate\r\npersons of the kind that one cannot easily shake off seized this\r\nopportunity to obtain an audience of so powerful a Minister. Two of them\r\nhanded him petitions; the third was content with pouring out a stream of\r\nlong-winded advice as to his political conduct.\r\n\r\n"One does not sleep," he said to himself, "when one has such a brain;\r\none ought not to walk about when one is so powerful." He returned to the\r\ntheatre, where it occurred to him that he might take a box in the third\r\ntier; from there his gaze could plunge, unnoticed by anyone, into the\r\nbox in the second tier in which he hoped to see the Contessa arrive. Two\r\nfull hours of waiting did not seem any too long to this lover; certain\r\nof not being seen he abandoned himself joyfully to the full extent of\r\nhis folly. "Old age," he said to himself, "is not that, more than\r\nanything else, the time when one is no longer capable of these delicious\r\npuerilities?"\r\n\r\nFinally the Contessa appeared. Armed with his glasses, he studied her\r\nwith rapture: "Young, brilliant, light as a bird," he said to himself,\r\n"she is not twenty-five. Her beauty is the least of her charms: where\r\nelse could one find that soul always sincere, which never acts _with\r\nprudence_, which abandons itself entirely to the impression of the\r\nmoment, which asks only to be carried away towards some new goal? I can\r\nunderstand Conte Nani\'s foolish behaviour."\r\n\r\nThe Conte supplied himself with excellent reasons for behaving\r\nfoolishly, so long as he was thinking only of capturing the happiness\r\nwhich he saw before his eyes. He did not find any quite so satisfactory\r\nwhen he came to consider his age and the anxieties, sometimes of the\r\nsaddest nature, that burdened his life. "A man of ability, whose spirit\r\nhas been destroyed by fear, gives me a sumptuous life and plenty of\r\nmoney to be his Minister; but were he to dismiss me to-morrow, I should\r\nbe left old and poor, that is to say everything that the world despises\r\nmost; there\'s a fine partner to offer the Contessa!" These thoughts were\r\ntoo dark, he came back to Signora Pietranera; he could not tire of\r\ngazing at her, and, to be able to think of her better, did not go down\r\nto her box. "Her only reason for taking Nani, they tell me, was to put\r\nthat imbecile Limercati in his place when he could not be prevailed upon\r\nto run a sword, or to hire someone else to stick a dagger into her\r\nhusband\'s murderer. I would fight for her twenty times over!" cried the\r\nConte in a transport of enthusiasm. Every moment he consulted the\r\ntheatre clock which, with illuminated figures upon a black background,\r\nwarned the audience every five minutes of the approach of the hour at\r\nwhich it was permissible for them to visit a friend\'s box. The Conte\r\nsaid to himself: "I cannot spend more than half an hour at the most in\r\nthe box, seeing that I have known her so short a time; if I stay longer,\r\nI shall attract attention, and, thanks to my age and even more to this\r\naccursed powder on my hair, I shall have all the bewitching allurements\r\nof a Cassandra." But a sudden thought made up his mind once and for all.\r\n"If she were to leave that box to pay someone else a visit, I should be\r\nwell rewarded for the avarice with which I am hoarding up this\r\npleasure." He rose to go down to the box in which he could see the\r\nContessa; all at once he found that he had lost almost all his desire to\r\npresent himself to her.\r\n\r\n"Ah! this is really charming," he exclaimed with a smile at his own\r\nexpense, and coming to a halt on the staircase; "an impulse of genuine\r\nshyness! It must be at least five and twenty years since an adventure of\r\nthis sort last came my way."\r\n\r\nHe entered the box, almost with an effort to control himself; and,\r\nmaking the most, like a man of spirit, of the condition in which he\r\nfound himself, made no attempt to appear at ease, or to display his wit\r\nby plunging into some entertaining story; he had the courage to be shy,\r\nhe employed his wits in letting his disturbance be apparent without\r\nmaking himself ridiculous. "If she should take it amiss," he said to\r\nhimself, "I am lost for ever. What! Shy, with my hair covered with\r\npowder, hair which, without the disguise of the powder, would be visibly\r\ngrey! But, after all, it is a fact; it cannot therefore be absurd unless\r\nI exaggerate it or make a boast of it." The Contessa had spent so many\r\nweary hours at the castle of Grianta, facing the powdered heads of her\r\nbrother and nephew, and of various politically _sound_ bores of the\r\nneighbourhood, that it never occurred to her to give a thought to her\r\nnew adorer\'s style in hairdressing.\r\n\r\nThe Contessa\'s mind having this protection against the impulse to laugh\r\non his entry, she paid attention only to the news from France which\r\nMosca always had for her in detail, on coming to her box; no doubt he\r\nused to invent it. As she discussed this news with him, she noticed this\r\nevening the expression in his eyes, which was good and kindly.\r\n\r\n"I can imagine," she said to him, "that at Parma, among your slaves, you\r\nwill not wear that friendly expression; it would ruin everything and\r\ngive them some hope of not being hanged!"\r\n\r\nThe entire absence of any sense of self-importance in a man who passed\r\nas the first diplomat in Italy, seemed strange to the Contessa; she even\r\nfound a certain charm in it. Moreover, as he talked well and with\r\nwarmth, she was not at all displeased that he should have thought fit to\r\ntake upon himself for one evening, without ulterior consequences, the\r\npart of squire of dames.\r\n\r\nIt was a great step forward, and highly dangerous; fortunately for the\r\nMinister, who, at Parma, never met a cruel fair, the Contessa had\r\narrived from Grianta only a few days before: her mind was still stiff\r\nwith the boredom of a country life. She had almost forgotten how to make\r\nfun; and all those things that appertain to a light and elegant way of\r\nliving had assumed in her eyes as it were a tint of novelty which made\r\nthem sacred; she was in no mood to laugh at anyone, even a lover of\r\nforty-five, and shy. A week later, the Conte\'s temerity might have met\r\nwith a very different sort of welcome.\r\n\r\nAt the Scala, it is not usual to prolong for more than twenty minutes or\r\nso these little visits to one\'s friends\' boxes; the Conte spent the\r\nwhole evening in the box in which he had been so fortunate as to meet\r\nSignora Pietranera. "She is a woman," he said to himself, "who revives\r\nin me all the follies of my youth!" But he was well aware of the danger.\r\n"Will my position as an all-powerful Bashaw in a place forty leagues\r\naway induce her to pardon me this stupid behaviour? I get so bored at\r\nParma!" Meanwhile, every quarter of an hour, he registered a mental vow\r\nto get up and go.\r\n\r\n"I must explain to you, Signora," he said to the Contessa with a laugh,\r\n"that at Parma I am bored to death, and I ought to be allowed to drink\r\nmy fill of pleasure when the cup comes my way. So, without involving you\r\nin anything and simply for this evening, permit me to play the part of\r\nlover in your company. Alas, in a few days I shall be far away from this\r\nbox which makes me forget every care and indeed, you will say, every\r\nconvention."\r\n\r\nA week after this monstrous visit to the Contessa\'s box, and after a\r\nseries of minor incidents the narration of which here would perhaps seem\r\ntedious, Conte Mosca was absolutely mad with love, and the Contessa had\r\nalready begun to think that his age need offer no objection if the\r\nsuitor proved attractive in other ways. They had reached this stage when\r\nMosca was recalled by a courier from Parma. One would have said that his\r\nPrince was afraid to be left alone. The Contessa returned to Grianta;\r\nher imagination no longer serving to adorn that lovely spot, it appeared\r\nto her a desert. "Should I be attached to this man?" she asked herself.\r\nMosca wrote to her, and had not to play a part; absence had relieved him\r\nof the source of all his anxious thoughts; his letters were amusing,\r\nand, by a little piece of eccentricity which was not taken amiss, to\r\nescape the comments of the Marchese del Dongo, who did not like having\r\nto pay for the carriage of letters, he used to send couriers who would\r\npost his at Como or Lecco or Varese or some other of those charming\r\nlittle places on the shores of the lake. This was done with the idea\r\nthat the courier might be employed to take back her replies. The move\r\nwas successful.\r\n\r\nSoon the days when the couriers came were events in the Contessa\'s life;\r\nthese couriers brought her flowers, fruit, little presents of no value,\r\nwhich amused her, however, and her sister-in-law as well. Her memory of\r\nthe Conte was blended with her idea of his great power; the Contessa had\r\nbecome curious to know everything that people said of him; the Liberals\r\nthemselves paid a tribute to his talents.\r\n\r\nThe principal source of the Conte\'s reputation for evil was that he\r\npassed as the head of the _Ultra_ Party at the Court of Parma, while the\r\nLiberal Party had at its head an intriguing woman capable of anything,\r\neven of succeeding, the Marchesa Raversi, who was immensely rich. The\r\nPrince made a great point of not discouraging that one of the two\r\nParties which happened not to be in power; he knew quite well that he\r\nhimself would always be the master, even with a Ministry formed in\r\nSignora Raversi\'s drawing-room. Endless details of these intrigues were\r\nreported at Grianta. The bodily absence of Mosca, whom everyone\r\ndescribed as a Minister of supreme talent and a man of action, made it\r\npossible not to think any more of his powdered head, a symbol of\r\neverything that is dull and sad; it was a detail of no consequence, one\r\nof the obligations of the court at which, moreover, he was playing so\r\ndistinguished a part. "It is a ridiculous thing, a court," said the\r\nContessa to the Marchesa, "but it is amusing; it is a game that it is\r\ninteresting to play, but one must agree to the rules. Who ever thought\r\nof protesting against the absurdity of the rules of piquet? And yet,\r\nonce you are accustomed to the rules, it is delightful to beat your\r\nadversary with _repique_ and _capot_."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_MILAN_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Contessa often thought about the writer of these entertaining\r\nletters; the days on which she received them were delightful to her; she\r\nwould take her boat and go to read them in one of the charming spots by\r\nthe lake, the Pliniana, Belan, the wood of the Sfrondata. These letters\r\nseemed to console her to some extent for Fabrizio\'s absence. She could\r\nnot, at all events, refuse to allow the Conte to be deeply in love; a\r\nmonth had not passed before she was thinking of him with tender\r\naffection. For his part, Conte Mosca was almost sincere when he offered\r\nto hand in his resignation, to leave the Ministry and to come and spend\r\nthe rest of his life with her at Milan or elsewhere. "I have 400,000\r\nfrancs," he added, "which will always bring us in an income of\r\n15,000."--"A box at the play again, horses, everything," thought the\r\nContessa; they were pleasant dreams. The sublime beauty of the different\r\nviews of the Lake of Como began to charm her once more. She went down to\r\ndream by its shores of this return to a brilliant and distinctive life,\r\nwhich, most unexpectedly, seemed to be coming within the bounds of\r\npossibility. She saw herself on the Corso, at Milan, happy and gay as in\r\nthe days of the Viceroy: "Youth, or at any rate a life of action would\r\nbegin again for me."\r\n\r\nSometimes her ardent imagination concealed things from her, but never\r\ndid she have those deliberate illusions which cowardice induces. She was\r\nabove all things a woman who was honest with herself. "If I am a little\r\ntoo old to be doing foolish things," she said to herself, "envy, which\r\ncreates illusions as love does, may poison my stay in Milan for me.\r\nAfter my husband\'s death, my noble poverty was a success, as was my\r\nrefusal of two vast fortunes. My poor little Conte Mosca had not a\r\ntwentieth part of the opulence that was cast at my feet by those two\r\nworms, Limercati and Nani. The meagre widow\'s pension which I had to\r\nstruggle to obtain, the dismissal of my servants, which made some\r\nsensation, the little fifth floor room which brought a score of\r\ncarriages to the door, all went to form at the time a striking\r\nspectacle. But I shall have unpleasant moments, however skilfully I may\r\nhandle things, if, never possessing any fortune beyond my widow\'s\r\npension, I go back to live at Milan on the snug little middle-class\r\ncomfort which we can secure with the 15,000 lire that Mosca will have\r\nleft after he retires. One strong objection, out of which envy will\r\nforge a terrible weapon, is that the Conte, although separated long ago\r\nfrom his wife, is still a married man. This separation is known at\r\nParma, but at Milan it will come as news, and they will put it down to\r\nme. So, my dear Scala, my divine Lake of Como, adieu! adieu!"\r\n\r\nIn spite of all these forebodings, if the Contessa had had the smallest\r\nincome of her own she would have accepted Mosca\'s offer to resign his\r\noffice. She regarded herself as a middle-aged woman, and the idea of the\r\ncourt alarmed her; but what will appear in the highest degree improbable\r\non this side of the Alps is that the Conte would have handed in that\r\nresignation gladly. So, at least, he managed to make his friend believe.\r\nIn all his letters he implored, with an ever increasing frenzy, a second\r\ninterview at Milan; it was granted him. "To swear that I feel an insane\r\npassion for you," the Contessa said to him one day at Milan, "would be a\r\nlie; I should be only too glad to love to-day at thirty odd as I used to\r\nlove at two-and-twenty! But I have seen so many things decay that I had\r\nimagined to be eternal! I have the most tender regard for you, I place\r\nan unbounded confidence in you, and of all the men I know, you are the\r\none I like best." The Contessa believed herself to be perfectly sincere;\r\nand yet, in the final clause, this declaration embodied a tiny\r\nfalsehood. Fabrizio, perhaps, had he chosen, might have triumphed over\r\nevery rival in her heart. But Fabrizio was nothing more than a boy in\r\nConte Mosca\'s eyes: he himself reached Milan three days after the young\r\nhothead\'s departure for Novara, and he hastened to intercede on his\r\nbehalf with Barone Binder. The Conte considered that his exile was now\r\nirrevocable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A RECENT CREATION_\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had not come to Milan alone; he had in his carriage the Duca\r\nSanseverina-Taxis, a handsome little old man of sixty-eight,\r\ndapple-grey, very polished, very neat, immensely rich but not quite as\r\nnoble as he ought to have been. It was his grandfather, only, who had\r\namassed millions from the office of Farmer General of the Revenues of\r\nthe State of Parma. His father had had himself made Ambassador of the\r\nPrince of Parma to the Court of ----, by advancing the following\r\nargument: "Your Highness allots 30,000 francs to his Representative at\r\nthe Court of ----, where he cuts an extremely modest figure. Should Your\r\nHighness deign to appoint me to the post, I will accept 6,000 francs as\r\nsalary. My expenditure at the Court of ---- will never fall below\r\n100,000 francs a year, and my agent will pay over 20,000 francs every\r\nyear to the Treasurer for Foreign Affairs at Parma. With that sum they\r\ncan attach to me whatever Secretary of Embassy they choose, and I shall\r\nshew no curiosity to inquire into diplomatic secrets, if there are any.\r\nMy object is to shed lustre on my house, which is still a new one, and\r\nto give it the distinction of having filled one of the great public\r\noffices."\r\n\r\nThe present Duca, this Ambassador\'s son and heir, had made the stupid\r\nmistake of coming out as a Semi-Liberal, and for the last two years had\r\nbeen in despair. In Napoleon\'s time, he had lost two or three millions\r\nowing to his obstinacy in remaining abroad, and even now, after the\r\nre-establishment of order in Europe, he had not managed to secure a\r\ncertain Grand Cordon which adorned the portrait of his father. The want\r\nof this Cordon was killing him by inches.\r\n\r\nAt the degree of intimacy which in Italy follows love, there was no\r\nlonger any obstacle in the nature of vanity between the lovers. It was\r\ntherefore with the most perfect simplicity that Mosca said to the woman\r\nhe adored:\r\n\r\n"I have two or three plans of conduct to offer you, all pretty well\r\nthought out; I have been thinking of nothing else for the last three\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n"First: I hand in my resignation, and we retire to a quiet life at Milan\r\nor Florence or Naples or wherever you please. We have an income of\r\n15,000 francs, apart from the Prince\'s generosity, which will continue\r\nfor some time, more or less.\r\n\r\n"Secondly: You condescend to come to the place in which I have some\r\nauthority; you buy a property, Sacca, for example, a charming house in\r\nthe middle of a forest, commanding the valley of the Po; you can have\r\nthe contract signed within a week from now. The Prince then attaches you\r\nto his court. But here I can see an immense objection. You will be well\r\nreceived at court; no one would think of refusing, with me there;\r\nbesides, the Princess imagines she is unhappy, and I have recently\r\nrendered her certain services with an eye to your future. But I must\r\nremind you of one paramount objection: the Prince is a bigoted\r\nchurchman, and, as you already know, ill luck will have it that I am a\r\nmarried man. From which will arise a million minor unpleasantnesses. You\r\nare a widow; it is a fine title which would have to be exchanged for\r\nanother, and this brings me to my third proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE DUCA SANSEVERINA_\r\n\r\n\r\n"One might find a new husband who would not be a nuisance. But first of\r\nall he would have to be considerably advanced in years, for why should\r\nyou deny me the hope of some day succeeding him? Very well, I have made\r\nthis curious arrangement with the Duca Sanseverina-Taxis, who, of\r\ncourse, does not know the name of his future Duchessa. He knows only\r\nthat she will make him an Ambassador and will procure him the Grand\r\nCordon which his father had and the lack of which makes him the most\r\nunhappy of mortals. Apart from this, the Duca is by no means an absolute\r\nidiot; he gets his clothes and wigs from Paris. He is not in the least\r\nthe sort of man who would do anything _deliberately_ mean, he seriously\r\nbelieves that honour consists in his having a Cordon, and he is ashamed\r\nof his riches. He came to me a year ago proposing to found a hospital,\r\nin order to get this Cordon; I laughed at him then, but he did not by\r\nany means laugh at me when I made him a proposal of marriage; my first\r\ncondition was, you can understand, that he must never set foot again in\r\nParma."\r\n\r\n"But do you know that what you are proposing is highly immoral?" said\r\nthe Contessa.\r\n\r\n"No more immoral than everything else that is done at our court and a\r\nscore of others. Absolute Power has this advantage, that it sanctifies\r\neverything in the eyes of the public: what harm can there be in a thing\r\nthat nobody notices? Our policy for the next twenty years is going to\r\nconsist in fear of the Jacobins--and such fear, too! Every year, we\r\nshall fancy ourselves on the eve of \'93. You will hear, I hope, the fine\r\nspeeches I make on the subject at my receptions! They are beautiful!\r\nEverything that can in any way reduce this fear will be _supremely\r\nmoral_ in the eyes of the nobles and the bigots. And you see, at Parma,\r\neveryone who is not either a noble or a bigot is in prison, or is\r\npacking up to go there; you may be quite sure that this marriage will\r\nnot be thought odd among us until the day on which I am disgraced. This\r\narrangement involves no dishonesty towards anyone; that is the essential\r\nthing, it seems to me. The Prince, on whose favour we are trading, has\r\nplaced only one condition on his consent, which is that the future\r\nDuchessa shall be of noble birth. Last year my office, all told, brought\r\nme in 107,000 francs; my total income would therefore be 122,000; I\r\ninvested 20,000 at Lyons. Very well, choose for yourself; either, a life\r\nof luxury based on our having 122,000 francs to spend, which, at Parma,\r\ngo as far as at least 400,000 at Milan, but with this marriage which\r\nwill give you the name of a passable man on whom you will never set eyes\r\nafter you leave the altar; or else the simple middle-class existence on\r\n15,000 francs at Florence or Naples, for I am of your opinion, you have\r\nbeen too much admired at Milan; we should be persecuted here by envy,\r\nwhich might perhaps succeed in souring our tempers. Our grand life at\r\nParma will, I hope, have some touches of novelty, even in your eyes\r\nwhich have seen the court of Prince Eug\xc3\xa8ne; you would be wise to try it\r\nbefore shutting the door on it for ever. Do not think that I am\r\nseeking to influence your opinion. As for me, my mind is quite made up:\r\nI would rather live on a fourth floor with you than continue that grand\r\nlife by myself."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A MATCH_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe possibility of this strange marriage was debated by the loving\r\ncouple every day. The Contessa saw the Duca Sanseverina-Taxis at the\r\nScala Ball, and thought him highly presentable. In one of their final\r\nconversations, Mosca summed up his proposals in the following words: "We\r\nmust take some decisive action if we wish to spend the rest of our lives\r\nin an enjoyable fashion and not grow old before our time. The Prince has\r\ngiven his approval; Sanseverina is a person who might easily be worse;\r\nhe possesses the finest _palazzo_ in Parma, and a boundless fortune; he\r\nis sixty-eight, and has an insane passion for the Grand Cordon; but\r\nthere is one great stain on his character: he once paid 10,000 francs\r\nfor a bust of Napoleon by Canova. His second sin, which will be the\r\ndeath of him if you do not come to his rescue, is that he lent 25\r\nnapoleons to Ferrante Palla, a lunatic of our country but also something\r\nof a genius, whom we have since sentenced to death, fortunately in his\r\nabsence. This Ferrante has written a couple of hundred lines in his time\r\nwhich are like nothing in the world; I will repeat them to you, they are\r\nas fine as Dante. The Prince then sends Sanseverina to the Court of\r\n----, he marries you on the day of his departure, and in the second year\r\nof his stay abroad, which he calls an Embassy, he receives the Grand\r\nCordon of the ----, without which he cannot live. You will have in him a\r\nbrother who will give you no trouble at all; he signs all the papers I\r\nrequire in advance, and besides you will see nothing of him, or as\r\nlittle as you choose. He asks for nothing better than never to shew his\r\nface at Parma, where his grandfather the tax-gatherer and his own\r\nprofession of Liberalism stand in his way. Rassi, our hangman, makes out\r\nthat the Duca was a secret subscriber to the _Constitutionnel_ through\r\nFerrante Palla the poet, and this slander was for a long time a serious\r\nobstacle in the way of the Prince\'s consent."\r\n\r\nWhy should the historian who follows faithfully all the most trivial\r\ndetails of the story that has been told him be held responsible? Is it\r\nhis fault if his characters, led astray by passions which he,\r\nunfortunately for himself, in no way shares, descend to conduct that is\r\nprofoundly immoral? It is true that things of this sort are no longer\r\ndone in a country where the sole passion that has outlived all the rest\r\nis that for money, as an excuse for vanity.\r\n\r\nThree months after the events we have just related, the Duchessa\r\nSanseverina-Taxis astonished the court of Parma by her easy affability\r\nand the noble serenity of her mind; her house was beyond comparison the\r\nmost attractive in the town. This was what Conte Mosca had promised his\r\nmaster. Ranuccio-Ernesto IV, the Reigning Prince, and the Princess his\r\nConsort, to whom she was presented by two of the greatest ladies in the\r\nland, gave her a most marked welcome. The Duchessa was curious to see\r\nthis Prince, master of the destiny of the man she loved, she was anxious\r\nto please him, and in this was more than successful. She found a man of\r\ntall stature but inclined to stoutness; his hair, his moustache, his\r\nenormous whiskers were of a fine gold, according to his courtiers;\r\nelsewhere they had provoked, by their faded tint, the ignoble word\r\n_flaxen_. From the middle of a plump face there projected to no distance\r\nat all a tiny nose that was almost feminine. But the Duchessa observed\r\nthat, in order to notice all these points of ugliness, one had first to\r\nattempt to catalogue the Prince\'s features separately. Taken as a whole,\r\nhe had the air of a man of sense and of firm character. His carriage,\r\nhis way of holding himself were by no means devoid of majesty, but often\r\nhe sought to impress the person he was addressing; at such times he grew\r\nembarrassed himself, and fell into an almost continuous swaying motion\r\nfrom one leg to the other. For the rest, Ernesto IV had a piercing and\r\ncommanding gaze; his gestures with his arms had nobility, and his speech\r\nwas at once measured and concise.\r\n\r\nMosca had warned the Duchessa that the Prince had, in the large cabinet\r\nin which he gave audiences, a full length portrait of Louis XIV, and a\r\nvery fine table by Scagliola of Florence. She found the imitation\r\nstriking; evidently he sought to copy the gaze and the noble utterance\r\nof Louis XIV, and he leaned upon the Scagliola table so as to give\r\nhimself the pose of Joseph II. He sat down as soon as he had uttered his\r\ngreeting to the Duchessa, to give her an opportunity to make use of the\r\n_tabouret_ befitting her rank. At this court, duchesses, princesses, and\r\nthe wives of Grandees of Spain alone have the right to sit; other women\r\nwait until the Prince or Princess invites them; and, to mark the\r\ndifference in rank, these August Personages always take care to allow a\r\nshort interval to elapse before inviting the ladies who are not\r\nduchesses to be seated. The Duchessa found that at certain moments the\r\nimitation of Louis XIV was a little too strongly marked in the Prince;\r\nfor instance, in his way of smiling good-naturedly and throwing back his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE COURT OF PARMA_\r\n\r\n\r\nErnesto IV wore an evening coat in the latest fashion, that had come\r\nfrom Paris; every month he had sent to him from that city, which he\r\nabhorred, an evening coat, a frock coat, and a hat. But by an odd blend\r\nof costume, on the day on which the Duchessa was received he had put on\r\nred breeches, silk stockings and very close-fitting shoes, models for\r\nwhich might be found in the portraits of Joseph II.\r\n\r\nHe received Signora Sanseverina graciously; the things he said to her\r\nwere shrewd and witty; but she saw quite plainly that there was no\r\nsuperfluity of warmth in his reception of her.--"Do you know why?" said\r\nConte Mosca on her return from the audience, "it is because Milan is a\r\nlarger and finer city than Parma. He was afraid, had he given you the\r\nwelcome that I expected and he himself had led me to hope, of seeming\r\nlike a provincial in ecstasies before the charms of a beautiful lady who\r\nhas come down from the capital. No doubt, too, he is still upset by a\r\ndetail which I hardly dare mention to you; the Prince sees at his court\r\nno woman who can vie with you in _beauty_. Yesterday evening, when he\r\nretired to bed, that was his sole topic of conversation with Pernice,\r\nhis principal valet, who is good enough to confide in me. I foresee a\r\nlittle revolution in etiquette; my chief enemy at this court is a fool\r\nwho goes by the name of General Fabio Conti. Just imagine a creature who\r\nhas been on active service for perhaps one day in his life, and sets out\r\nfrom that to copy the bearing of Frederick the Great. In addition to\r\nwhich, he aims also at copying the noble affability of General La\r\nFayette, and that because he is the leader, here, of the Liberal Party\r\n(God knows what sort of Liberals!)."\r\n\r\n"I know your Fabio Conti," said the Duchessa; "I had a good view of him\r\nonce near Como; he was quarrelling with the police." She related the\r\nlittle adventure which the reader may perhaps remember.\r\n\r\n"You will learn one day, Signora, if your mind ever succeeds in\r\npenetrating the intricacies of our etiquette, that young ladies do not\r\nappear at court here until after their marriage. At the same time, the\r\nPrince has, for the superiority of his city of Parma over all others, a\r\npatriotism so ardent that I would wager that he will find some way of\r\nhaving little Clelia Conti, our La Fayette\'s daughter, presented to him.\r\nShe is charming, upon my soul she is; and was still reckoned, a week\r\nago, the best-looking person in the States of the Prince.\r\n\r\n"I do not know," the Conte went on, "whether the horrors that the\r\nenemies of our Sovereign have disseminated against him, have reached the\r\ncastle of Grianta; they make him out a monster, an ogre. The truth is\r\nthat Ernesto IV was full of dear little virtues, and one may add that,\r\nhad he been invulnerable like Achilles, he would have continued to be\r\nthe model of a potentate. But in a moment of boredom and anger, and also\r\na little in imitation of Louis XIV cutting off the head of some hero or\r\nother of the Fronde, who was discovered living in peaceful solitude on a\r\nplot of land near Versailles, fifty years after the Fronde, one fine day\r\nErnesto IV had two Liberals hanged. It seems that these rash fellows\r\nused to meet on fixed days to speak evil of the Prince and address\r\nardent prayers to heaven that the plague might visit Parma and deliver\r\nthem from the tyrant. The word _tyrant_ was proved. Rassi called this\r\nconspiracy; he had them sentenced to death, and the execution of one of\r\nthem, Conte L----, was atrocious. All this happened before my time.\r\nSince that fatal hour," the Conte went on, lowering his voice, "the\r\nPrince has been subject to fits of panic _unworthy of a man_, but these\r\nare the sole source of the favour that I enjoy. But for this royal fear,\r\nmine would be a kind of merit too abrupt, too harsh for this court,\r\nwhere idiocy runs rampant. Would you believe that the Prince looks under\r\nthe beds in his room before going to sleep, and spends a million, which\r\nat Parma is the equivalent of four millions at Milan, to have a good\r\npolice force; and you see before you, Signora Duchessa, the Chief of\r\nthat terrible Police. By the police, that is to say by fear, I have\r\nbecome Minister of War and Finance; and as the Minister of the Interior\r\nis my nominal chief, in so far as he has the police under his\r\njurisdiction, I have had that portfolio given to Conte Zurla-Contarini,\r\nan imbecile who is a glutton for work and gives himself the pleasure of\r\nwriting eighty letters a day. I received one only this morning on which\r\nConte Zurla-Contarini has had the satisfaction of writing with his own\r\nhand the number 20,715."\r\n\r\nThe Duchessa Sanseverina was presented to the melancholy Princess of\r\nParma, Clara-Paolina, who, because her husband had a mistress (quite an\r\nattractive woman, the Marchesa Balbi), imagined herself to be the most\r\nunhappy person in the universe, a belief which had made her perhaps the\r\nmost trying. The Duchessa found a very tall and very thin woman, who was\r\nnot thirty-six and appeared fifty. A symmetrical and noble face might\r\nhave passed as beautiful, though somewhat spoiled by the large round\r\neyes which could barely see, if the Princess had not herself abandoned\r\nevery attempt at beauty. She received the Duchessa with a shyness so\r\nmarked that certain courtiers, enemies of Conte Mosca, ventured to say\r\nthat the Princess looked like the woman who was being presented and the\r\nDuchessa like the sovereign. The Duchessa, surprised and almost\r\ndisconcerted, could find no language that would put her in a place\r\ninferior to that which the Princess assumed for herself. To restore some\r\nself-possession to this poor Princess, who at heart was not wanting in\r\nintelligence, the Duchessa could think of nothing better than to begin,\r\nand keep going, a long dissertation on botany. The Princess was really\r\nlearned in this science; she had some very fine hothouses with\r\nquantities of tropical plants. The Duchessa, while seeking simply for a\r\nway out of a difficult position, made a lifelong conquest of Princess\r\nClara-Paolina, who, from the shy and speechless creature that she had\r\nbeen at the beginning of the audience, found herself towards the end so\r\nmuch at her ease, that, in defiance of all the rules of etiquette, this\r\nfirst audience lasted for no less than an hour and a quarter. Next day,\r\nthe Duchessa sent out to purchase some exotic plants, and posed as a\r\ngreat lover of botany.\r\n\r\nThe Princess spent all her time with the venerable Father Landriani,\r\nArchbishop of Parma, a man of learning, a man of intelligence even, and\r\na perfectly honest man, but one who presented a singular spectacle when\r\nhe was seated in his chair of crimson velvet (it was the privilege of\r\nhis office) opposite the armchair of the Princess, surrounded by her\r\nmaids of honour and her two ladies _of company_. The old prelate, with his\r\nflowing white locks, was even more timid, were such a thing possible,\r\nthan the Princess; they saw one another every day, and every audience\r\nbegan with a silence that lasted fully a quarter of an hour. To such a\r\nstate had they come that the Contessa Alvizi, one of the ladies of\r\ncompany, had become a sort of favourite, because she possessed the art\r\nof encouraging them to talk and so breaking the silence.\r\n\r\nTo end the series of presentations, the Duchessa was admitted to the\r\npresence of H.S.H. the Crown Prince, a personage of taller stature than\r\nhis father and more timid than his mother. He was learned in mineralogy,\r\nand was sixteen years old. He blushed excessively on seeing the Duchessa\r\ncome in, and was so put off his balance that he could not think of a\r\nword to say to that beautiful lady. He was a fine-looking young man, and\r\nspent his life in the woods, hammer in hand. At the moment when the\r\nDuchessa rose to bring this silent audience to an end:\r\n\r\n"My God! Signora, how pretty you are!" exclaimed the Crown Prince; a\r\nremark which was not considered to be in too bad taste by the lady\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nThe Marchesa Balbi, a young woman of five-and-twenty, might still have\r\npassed for the most perfect type of _leggiadria italiana_, two or three\r\nyears before the arrival of the Duchessa Sanseverina at Parma. As it\r\nwas, she had still the finest eyes in the world and the most charming\r\nairs, but, viewed close at hand, her skin was netted with countless fine\r\nlittle wrinkles which made the Marchesa look like a young grandmother.\r\nSeen from a certain distance, in the theatre for instance, in her box,\r\nshe was still a beauty, and the people in the pit thought that the\r\nPrince shewed excellent taste. He spent every evening with the Marchesa\r\nBalbi, but often without opening his lips, and the boredom she saw on\r\nthe Prince\'s face had made this poor woman decline into an extraordinary\r\nthinness. She laid claim to an unlimited subtlety, and was always\r\nsmiling a bitter smile; she had the prettiest teeth in the world, and in\r\nseason and out, having little or no sense, would attempt by an ironical\r\nsmile to give some hidden meaning to her words. Conte Mosca said that it\r\nwas these continual smiles, while inwardly she was yawning, that gave\r\nher all her wrinkles. The Balbi had a finger in every pie, and the State\r\nnever made a contract for 1,000 francs without there being some little\r\n_ricordo_ (this was the polite expression at Parma) for the Marchesa.\r\nCommon report would have it that she had invested six millions in\r\nEngland, but her fortune, which indeed was of recent origin, did not in\r\nreality amount to 1,500,000 francs. It was to be out of reach of her\r\nstratagems, and to have her dependent upon himself, that Conte Mosca had\r\nmade himself Minister of Finance. The Marchesa\'s sole passion was fear\r\ndisguised in sordid avarice: "_I shall die on straw_!" she used\r\noccasionally to say to the Prince, who was shocked by such a remark. The\r\nDuchessa noticed that the ante-room, resplendent with gilding, of the\r\nBalbi\'s _palazzo_, was lighted by a single candle which guttered on a\r\npriceless marble table, and that the doors of her drawing-room were\r\nblackened by the footmen\'s fingers.\r\n\r\n"She received me," the Duchessa told her lover, "as though she expected\r\nme to offer her a gratuity of 50 francs."\r\n\r\nThe course of the Duchessa\'s successes was slightly interrupted by the\r\nreception given her by the shrewdest woman of the court, the celebrated\r\nMarchesa Raversi, a consummate intriguer who had established herself at\r\nthe head of the party opposed to that of Conte Mosca. She was anxious to\r\noverthrow him, all the more so in the last few months, since she was the\r\nniece of the Duca Sanseverina, and was afraid of seeing her prospects\r\nimpaired by the charms of his new Duchessa. "The Raversi is by no means\r\na woman to be ignored," the Conte told his mistress; "I regard her as so\r\nfar capable of sticking at nothing that I separated from my wife solely\r\nbecause she insisted on taking as her lover Cavaliere Bentivoglio, a\r\nfriend of the Raversi." This lady, a tall virago with very dark hair,\r\nremarkable for the diamonds which she wore all day, and the rouge with\r\nwhich she covered her cheeks, had declared herself in advance the\r\nDuchessa\'s enemy, and when she received her in her own house made it her\r\nbusiness to open hostilities. The Duca Sanseverina, in the letters he\r\nwrote from ----, appeared so delighted with his Embassy, and above all,\r\nwith the prospect of the Grand Cordon, that his family were afraid of\r\nhis leaving part of his fortune to his wife, whom he loaded with little\r\npresents. The Raversi, although definitely ugly, had for a lover Conte\r\nBaldi, the handsomest man at court; generally speaking, she was\r\nsuccessful in all her undertakings.\r\n\r\nThe Duchessa lived in the greatest style imaginable. The _palazzo_\r\nSanseverina had always been one of the most magnificent in the city of\r\nParma, and the Duca, to celebrate the occasion of his Embassy and his\r\nfuture Grand Cordon, was spending enormous sums upon its decoration; the\r\nDuchessa directed the work in person.\r\n\r\nThe Conte had guessed aright; a few days after the presentation of the\r\nDuchessa, young Clelia Conti came to court; she had been made a\r\nCanoness. In order to parry the blow which this favour might be thought\r\nto have struck at the Conte\'s influence, the Duchessa gave a party, on\r\nthe pretext of throwing open the new garden of her _palazzo_, and by the\r\nexercise of her most charming manners made Clelia, whom she called her\r\nyoung friend of the Lake of Como, the queen of the evening. Her monogram\r\nwas displayed, as though by accident, upon the principal transparencies.\r\nThe young Clelia, although slightly pensive, was pleasant in the way in\r\nwhich she spoke of the little adventure by the Lake, and of her warm\r\ngratitude. She was said to be deeply religious and very fond of\r\nsolitude. "I would wager," said the Conte, "that she has enough sense to\r\nbe ashamed of her father." The Duchessa made a friend of this girl; she\r\nfelt attracted towards her, she did not wish to appear jealous, and\r\nincluded her in all her pleasure parties; after all, her plan was to\r\nseek to diminish all the enmities of which the Conte was the object.\r\n\r\nEverything smiled on the Duchessa; she was amused by this court\r\nexistence where a sudden storm is always to be feared; she felt as\r\nthough she were beginning life over again. She was tenderly attached to\r\nthe Conte, who was literally mad with happiness. This pleasing situation\r\nhad bred in him an absolute impassivity towards everything in which only\r\nhis professional interests were concerned. And so, barely two months\r\nafter the Duchessa\'s arrival, he obtained the patent and honours of\r\nPrime Minister, honours which come very near to those paid to the\r\nSovereign himself. The Conte had complete control of his master\'s will;\r\nthey had a proof of this at Parma by which everyone was impressed.\r\n\r\nTo the southeast, and within ten minutes of the town rises that famous\r\ncitadel so renowned throughout Italy, the main tower of which stands one\r\nhundred and eighty feet high and is visible from so far. This tower,\r\nconstructed on the model of Hadrian\'s Tomb, at Rome, by the Farnese,\r\ngrandsons of Paul III, in the first half of the sixteenth century, is so\r\nlarge in diameter that on the platform in which it ends it has been\r\npossible to build a _palazzo_ for the governor of the citadel and a new\r\nprison called the Farnese tower. This prison, erected in honour of the\r\neldest son of Ranuccio-Ernesto II, who had become the accepted lover of\r\nhis stepmother, is regarded as a fine and singular monument throughout\r\nthe country. The Duchessa was curious to see it; on the day of her visit\r\nthe heat was overpowering in Parma, and up there, in that lofty\r\nposition, she found fresh air, which so delighted her that she stayed\r\nfor several hours. The officials made a point of throwing open to her\r\nthe rooms of the Farnese tower.\r\n\r\nThe Duchessa met on the platform of the great tower a poor Liberal\r\nprisoner who had come to enjoy the half-hour\'s outing that was allowed\r\nhim every third day. On her return to Parma, not having yet acquired the\r\ndiscretion necessary in an absolute court, she spoke of this man, who\r\nhad told her the whole history of his life. The Marchesa Raversi\'s\r\nparty seized hold of these utterances of the Duchessa and repeated them\r\nbroadcast, greatly hoping that they would shock the Prince. Indeed,\r\nErnesto IV was in the habit of repeating that the essential thing was to\r\nimpress the imagination. "_Perpetual_ is a big word," he used to say,\r\n"and more terrible in Italy than elsewhere": accordingly, never in his\r\nlife had he granted a pardon. A week after her visit to the fortress the\r\nDuchessa received a letter commuting a sentence, signed by the Prince\r\nand by his Minister, with a blank left for the name. The prisoner whose\r\nname she chose to write in this space would obtain the restoration of\r\nhis property, with permission to spend the rest of his days in America.\r\nThe Duchessa wrote the name of the man who had talked to her.\r\nUnfortunately this man turned out to be half a rogue, a weak-kneed\r\ncreature; it was on the strength of his confessions that the famous\r\nFerrante Palla had been sentenced to death.\r\n\r\nThe unprecedented nature of this pardon set the seal upon Signora\r\nSanseverina\'s position. Conte Mosca was wild with delight; it was a\r\ngreat day in his life and one that had a decisive influence on\r\nFabrizio\'s destiny. He, meanwhile, was still at Romagnano, near Novara,\r\ngoing to confession, hunting, reading nothing, and paying court to a\r\nlady of noble birth, as was laid down in his instructions. The Duchessa\r\nwas still a trifle shocked by this last essential. Another sign which\r\nboded no good to the Conte was that, while she would speak to him with\r\nthe utmost frankness about everyone else, and would think aloud in his\r\npresence, she never mentioned Fabrizio to him without first carefully\r\nchoosing her words.\r\n\r\n"If you like," the Conte said to her one day, "I will write to that\r\ncharming brother you have on the Lake of Como, and I will soon force\r\nthat Marchese del Dongo, if I and my friends in a certain quarter apply\r\na little pressure, to ask for the pardon of your dear Fabrizio. If it be\r\ntrue, as I have not the least doubt that it is, that Fabrizio is\r\nsomewhat superior to the young fellows who ride their English\r\nthoroughbreds about the streets of Milan, what a life, at eighteen, to\r\nbe doing nothing with no prospect of ever having anything to do! If\r\nheaven had endowed him with a real passion for anything in the world,\r\nwere it only for angling, I should respect it; but what is he to do at\r\nMilan, even after he has obtained his pardon? He will get on a horse,\r\nwhich he will have had sent to him from England, at a certain hour of\r\nthe day; at another, idleness will take him to his mistress, for whom he\r\nwill care less than he will for his horse. . . . But, if you say the\r\nword, I will try to procure this sort of life for your nephew."\r\n\r\n"I should like him to be an officer," said the Duchessa.\r\n\r\n"Would you recommend a Sovereign to entrust a post which, at a given\r\ndate, may be of some importance to a young man who, in the first place,\r\nis liable to enthusiasm, and, secondly, has shewn enthusiasm for\r\nNapoleon to the extent of going to join him at Waterloo? Just think\r\nwhere we should all be if Napoleon had won at Waterloo! We should have\r\nno Liberals to be afraid of, it is true, but the Sovereigns of ancient\r\nHouses would be able to keep their thrones only by marrying the\r\ndaughters of his Marshals. And so military life for Fabrizio would be\r\nthe life of a squirrel in a revolving cage: plenty of movement with no\r\nprogress. He would have the annoyance of seeing himself cut out by all\r\nsorts of plebeian devotion. The essential quality in a young man of the\r\npresent day, that is to say for the next fifty years perhaps, so long as\r\nwe remain in a state of fear and religion has not been re-established,\r\nis not to be liable to enthusiasm and not to shew any spirit.\r\n\r\n"I have thought of one thing, but one that will begin by making you cry\r\nout in protest, and will give me infinite trouble for many a day to\r\ncome: it is an act of folly which I am ready to commit for you. But tell\r\nme, if you can, what folly would I not commit to win a smile?"\r\n\r\n"Well?" said the Duchessa.\r\n\r\n"Well, we have had as Archbishops of Parma three members of your family:\r\nAscanio del Dongo who wrote a book in sixteen-something, Fabrizio in\r\n1699, and another Ascanio in 1740. If Fabrizio cares to enter the\r\nprelacy, and to make himself conspicuous for virtues of the highest\r\norder, I can make him a Bishop somewhere, and then Archbishop here,\r\nprovided that my influence lasts. The real objection is this: shall I\r\nremain Minister for long enough to carry out this fine plan, which will\r\nrequire several years? The Prince may die, he may have the bad taste to\r\ndismiss me. But, after all, it is the only way open to me of securing\r\nfor Fabrizio something that is worthy of you."\r\n\r\nThey discussed the matter at length: the idea was highly repugnant to\r\nthe Duchessa.\r\n\r\n"Prove to me again," she said to the Conte, "that every other career is\r\nimpossible for Fabrizio." The Conte proved it.\r\n\r\n"You regret," he added, "the brilliant uniform; but as to that, I do not\r\nknow what to do."\r\n\r\nAfter a month in which the Duchessa had asked to be allowed to think\r\nthings over, she yielded with a sigh to the sage views of the Minister.\r\n"Either ride stiffly upon an English horse through the streets of some\r\nbig town," repeated the Conte, "or adopt a calling that is not\r\nunbefitting his birth; I can see no middle course. Unfortunately, a\r\ngentleman cannot become either a doctor or a barrister, and this age is\r\nmade for barristers.\r\n\r\n"Always bear in mind, Signora," the Conte went on, "that you are giving\r\nyour nephew, on the streets of Milan, the lot enjoyed by the young men\r\nof his age who pass for the most fortunate. His pardon once procured,\r\nyou will give him fifteen, twenty, thirty thousand francs; the amount\r\ndoes not matter; neither you nor I make any pretence of saving money."\r\n\r\nThe Duchessa was susceptible to the idea of fame; she did not wish\r\nFabrizio to be simply a young man living on an allowance; she reverted\r\nto her lover\'s plan.\r\n\r\n"Observe," the Conte said to her, "that I do not pretend to turn\r\nFabrizio into an exemplary priest, like so many that you see. No, he is\r\na great gentleman, first and foremost; he can remain perfectly ignorant\r\nif it seems good to him, and will none the less become Bishop and\r\nArchbishop, if the Prince continues to regard me as a useful person.\r\n\r\n"If your orders deign to transform my proposal into an immutable\r\ndecree," the Conte went on, "our _prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9_ must on no account be seen\r\nin Parma living with modest means. His subsequent promotion will cause a\r\nscandal if people have seen him here as an ordinary priest; he ought not\r\nto appear in Parma until he has his _violet stockings_[10] and a\r\nsuitable establishment. Then everyone will assume that your nephew is\r\ndestined to be a Bishop, and nobody will be shocked.\r\n\r\n"If you will take my advice, you will send Fabrizio to take his theology\r\nand spend three years at Naples. During the vacations of the\r\nEcclesiastical Academy he can go if he likes to visit Paris and London,\r\nbut he must never shew his face in Parma." This sentence made the\r\nDuchessa shudder.\r\n\r\nShe sent a courier to her nephew, asking him to meet her at Piacenza.\r\nNeed it be said that this courier was the bearer of all the means of\r\nobtaining money and all the necessary passports?\r\n\r\nArriving first at Piacenza, Fabrizio hastened to meet the Duchessa, and\r\nembraced her with transports of joy which made her dissolve in tears.\r\nShe was glad that the Conte was not present; since they had fallen in\r\nlove, it was the first time that she had experienced this sensation.\r\n\r\nFabrizio was profoundly touched, and then distressed by the plans which\r\nthe Duchessa had made for him; his hope had always been that, his affair\r\nat Waterloo settled, he might end by becoming a soldier. One thing\r\nstruck the Duchessa, and still further increased the romantic opinion\r\nthat she had formed of her nephew; he refused absolutely to lead a\r\n_caff\xc3\xa8_-haunting existence in one of the big towns of Italy.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you see yourself on the _Corso_ of Florence or Naples," said the\r\nDuchessa, "with thoroughbred English horses? For the evenings a\r\ncarriage, a charming apartment," and so forth. She dwelt with exquisite\r\nrelish on the details of this vulgar happiness, which she saw Fabrizio\r\nthrust from him with disdain. "He is a hero," she thought.\r\n\r\n"And after ten years of this agreeable life, what shall I have done?"\r\nsaid Fabrizio; "what shall I be? A young man _of a certain age_, who\r\nwill have to move out of the way of the first good-looking boy who makes\r\nhis appearance in society, also mounted upon an English horse."\r\n\r\nFabrizio at first utterly rejected the idea of the Church. He spoke of\r\ngoing to New York, of becoming an American citizen and a soldier of the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n"What a mistake you are making! You won\'t have any war, and you\'ll fall\r\nback into the _caff\xc3\xa8_ life, only without smartness, without music,\r\nwithout love affairs," replied the Duchessa. "Believe me, for you just\r\nas much as for myself, it would be a wretched existence there in\r\nAmerica." She explained to him the cult of the god _Dollar_, and the\r\nrespect that had to be shewn to the artisans in the street who by their\r\nvotes decided everything. They came back to the idea of the Church.\r\n\r\n"Before you fly into a passion," the Duchessa said to him, "just try to\r\nunderstand what the Conte is asking you to do; there is no question\r\nwhatever of your being a poor priest of more or less exemplary and\r\nvirtuous life, like Priore Blan\xc3\xa8s. Remember the example of your uncles,\r\nthe Archbishops of Parma; read over again the accounts of their lives in\r\nthe supplement to the Genealogy. First and foremost, a man with a name\r\nlike yours has to be a great gentleman, noble, generous, an upholder of\r\njustice, destined from the first to find himself at the head of his\r\norder . . . and in the whole of his life doing only one dishonourable\r\nthing, and that a very useful one."\r\n\r\n"So all my illusions are shattered," said Fabrizio, heaving a deep sigh;\r\n"it is a cruel sacrifice! I admit, I had not taken into account this\r\nhorror of enthusiasm and spirit, even when wielded to their advantage,\r\nwhich from now onwards is going to prevail amongst absolute monarchs."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ITALIAN PRUDENCE_\r\n\r\n\r\n"Remember that a proclamation, a caprice of the heart flings the\r\nenthusiast into the bosom of the opposite party to the one he has served\r\nall his life!"\r\n\r\n"I an enthusiast!" repeated Fabrizio; "a strange accusation! I cannot\r\nmanage even to be in love!"\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed the Duchessa.\r\n\r\n"When I have the honour to pay my court to a beauty, even if she is of\r\ngood birth and sound religious principles, I cannot think about her\r\nexcept when I see her."\r\n\r\nThis avowal made a strange impression upon the Duchessa.\r\n\r\n"I ask for a month," Fabrizio went on, "in which to take leave of\r\nSignora C----, of Novara, and, what will be more difficult still, of all\r\nthe castles I have been building in the air all my life. I shall write\r\nto my mother, who will be so good as to come and see me at Belgirate, on\r\nthe Piedmontese shore of Lake Maggiore, and, in thirty-one days from\r\nnow, I shall be in Parma incognito."\r\n\r\n"No, whatever you do!" cried the Duchessa. She did not wish Conte Mosca\r\nto see her talking to Fabrizio.\r\n\r\nThe same pair met again at Piacenza. The Duchessa this time was highly\r\nagitated: a storm had broken at court; the Marchesa Raversi\'s party was\r\non the eve of a triumph; it was on the cards that Conte Mosca might be\r\nreplaced by General Fabio Conti, the leader of what was called at Parma\r\nthe _Liberal Party_. Omitting only the name of the rival who was growing\r\nin the Prince\'s favour, the Duchessa told Fabrizio everything. She\r\ndiscussed afresh the chances of his future career, even with the\r\nprospect of his losing the all-powerful influence of the Conte.\r\n\r\n"I am going to spend three years in the Ecclesiastical Academy at\r\nNaples," exclaimed Fabrizio; "but since I must be before all things a\r\nyoung gentleman, and you do not oblige me to lead the life of a virtuous\r\nseminarist, the prospect of this stay at Naples does not frighten me in\r\nthe least; the life there will be in every way as pleasant as life at\r\nRomagnano; the best society of the neighbourhood was beginning to class\r\nme as a Jacobin. In my exile I have discovered that I know nothing, not\r\neven Latin, not even how to spell. I had planned to begin my education\r\nover again at Novara; I shall willingly study theology at Naples; it is\r\na complicated science." The Duchessa was overjoyed. "If we are driven\r\nout of Parma," she told him, "we shall come and visit you at Naples. But\r\nsince you agree, until further orders, to try for the violet stockings,\r\nthe Conte, who knows the Italy of to-day through and through, has given\r\nme an idea to suggest to you. Believe or not, as you choose, what they\r\nteach you, _but never raise any objection_. Imagine that they are teaching\r\nyou the rules of the game of whist; would you raise any objection to the\r\nrules of whist? I have told the Conte that you do believe, and he is\r\ndelighted to hear it; it is useful in this world and in the next. But,\r\nif you believe, do not fall into the vulgar habit of speaking with\r\nhorror of Voltaire, Diderot, Raynal and all those harebrained Frenchmen\r\nwho paved the way to the Dual Chamber. Their names should not be allowed\r\nto pass your lips, but if you must mention them, speak of these\r\ngentlemen with a calm irony: they are people who have long since been\r\nrefuted and whose attacks are no longer of any consequence. Believe\r\nblindly everything that they tell you at the Academy. Bear in mind that\r\nthere are people who will make a careful note of your slightest\r\nobjections; they will forgive you a little amorous intrigue if it is\r\ndone in the proper way, but not a doubt: age stifles intrigue but\r\nencourages doubt. Act on this principle at the tribunal of penitence.\r\nYou shall have a letter of recommendation to a Bishop who is factotum to\r\nthe Cardinal Archbishop of Naples: to him alone you should admit your\r\nescapade in France and your presence on the 18th of June in the\r\nneighbourhood of Waterloo. Even then, cut it as short as possible,\r\nconfess it only so that they cannot reproach you with having kept it\r\nsecret. You were so young at the time!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE COURT_\r\n\r\n\r\n"The second idea which the Conte sends you is this: if there should\r\noccur to you a brilliant argument, a triumphant retort that will change\r\nthe course of the conversation, do not give in to the temptation to\r\nshine; remain silent: people of any discernment will see your cleverness\r\nin your eyes. It will be time enough to be witty when you are a Bishop."\r\n\r\nFabrizio began his life at Naples with an unpretentious carriage and\r\nfour servants, good Milanese, whom his aunt had sent him. After a year\r\nof study, no one said of him that he was a man of parts: people looked\r\nupon him as a great nobleman, of a studious bent, extremely generous,\r\nbut something of a libertine.\r\n\r\nThat year, amusing enough for Fabrizio, was terrible for the Duchessa.\r\nThe Conte was three or four times within an inch of ruin; the Prince,\r\nmore timorous than ever, because he was ill that year, believed that by\r\ndismissing him he could free himself from the odium of the executions\r\ncarried out before the Conte had entered his service. Rassi was the\r\ncherished favourite who must at all costs be retained. The Conte\'s\r\nperils won him the passionate attachment of the Duchessa; she gave no\r\nmore thought to Fabrizio. To lend colour to their possible retirement,\r\nit appeared that the air of Parma, which was indeed a trifle damp as it\r\nis everywhere in Lombardy, did not at all agree with her. Finally, after\r\nintervals of disgrace which went so far as to make the Conte, though\r\nPrime Minister, spend sometimes twenty whole days without seeing his\r\nmaster privately, Mosca won; he secured the appointment of General Fabio\r\nConti, the so-called Liberal, as governor of the citadel in which were\r\nimprisoned the Liberals condemned by Rassi. "If Conti shows any leniency\r\ntowards his prisoners," Mosca observed to his lady, "he will be\r\ndisgraced as a Jacobin whose political theories have made him forget his\r\nduty as a general; if he shows himself stern and pitiless, and that, to\r\nmy mind, is the direction in which he will tend, he ceases to be the\r\nleader of his own party and alienates all the families that have a\r\nrelative in the citadel. This poor man has learned how to assume an air\r\nof awed respect on the approach of the Prince; if necessary, he changes\r\nhis clothes four times a day; he can discuss a question of etiquette,\r\nbut his is not a head capable of following the difficult path by which\r\nalone he can save himself from destruction; and in any case, I am\r\nthere."\r\n\r\nThe day after the appointment of General Fabio Conti, which brought the\r\nministerial crisis to an end, it was announced that Parma was to have an\r\nultra-monarchist newspaper.\r\n\r\n"What feuds the paper will create!" said the Duchessa.\r\n\r\n"This paper, the idea of which is perhaps my masterpiece," replied the\r\nConte with a smile, "I shall gradually and quite against my will allow\r\nto pass into the hands of the ultra-rabid section. I have attached some\r\ngood salaries to the editorial posts. People are coming from all\r\nquarters to beg for employment on it; the excitement will help us\r\nthrough the next month or two, and people will forget the danger I have\r\nbeen in. Those seriously minded gentlemen P---- and D---- are already on\r\nthe list."\r\n\r\n"But this paper will be quite revoltingly absurd."\r\n\r\n"I am reckoning on that," replied the Conte. "The Prince will read it\r\nevery morning and admire the doctrines taught by myself as its founder.\r\nAs to the details, he will approve or be shocked; of the hours which he\r\ndevotes every day to work, two will be taken up in this way. The paper\r\nwill get itself into trouble, but when the serious complaints begin to\r\ncome in, in eight or ten months\' time, it will be entirely in the hands\r\nof the ultra-rabids. It will be this party, which is annoying me, that\r\nwill have to answer; as for me, I shall raise objections to the paper;\r\nbut after all I greatly prefer a hundred absurdities to one hanging. Who\r\nremembers an absurdity two years after the publication of the official\r\ngazette! It is better than having the sons and family of the hanged man\r\nvowing a hatred which will last as long as I shall and may perhaps\r\nshorten my life."\r\n\r\nThe Duchessa, always passionately interested in something, always\r\nactive, never idle, had more spirit than the whole court of Parma put\r\ntogether; but she lacked the patience and impassivity necessary for\r\nsuccess in intrigue. However, she had managed to follow with passionate\r\nexcitement the interests of the various groups, she was beginning even\r\nto establish a certain personal reputation with the Prince.\r\nClara-Paolina, the Princess Consort, surrounded with honours but a\r\nprisoner to the most antiquated etiquette, looked upon herself as the\r\nunhappiest of women. The Duchessa Sanseverina paid her various\r\nattentions and tried to prove to her that she was by no means so unhappy\r\nas she supposed. It should be explained that the Prince saw his wife\r\nonly at dinner: this meal lasted for thirty minutes, and the Prince\r\nwould spend whole weeks without saying a word to Clara-Paolina. Signora\r\nSanseverina attempted to change all this; she amused the Prince, all the\r\nmore as she had managed to retain her independence intact. Had she\r\nwished to do so, she could not have succeeded in never hurting any of\r\nthe fools who swarmed about this court. It was this utter inadaptability\r\non her part that led to her being execrated by the common run of\r\ncourtiers, all Conti or Marchesi, with an average income of 5,000 lire.\r\nShe realised this disadvantage after the first few days, and devoted\r\nherself exclusively to pleasing the Sovereign and his Consort, the\r\nlatter of whom was in absolute control of the Crown Prince. The Duchessa\r\nknew how to amuse the Sovereign, and profited by the extreme attention\r\nhe paid to her lightest word to put in some shrewd thrusts at the\r\ncourtiers who hated her. After the foolish actions that Rassi had made\r\nhim commit, and for foolishness that sheds blood there is no reparation,\r\nthe Prince was sometimes afraid and was often bored, which had brought\r\nhim to a state of morbid envy; he felt that he was deriving little\r\namusement from life, and grew sombre when he saw other people amused;\r\nthe sight of happiness made him furious. "We must keep our love secret,"\r\nshe told her admirer, and gave the Prince to understand that she was\r\nonly very moderately attached to the Conte, who for that matter was so\r\nthoroughly deserving of esteem.\r\n\r\nThis discovery had given His Highness a happy day. From time to time,\r\nthe Duchessa let fall a few words about the plan she had in her mind of\r\ntaking a few months\' holiday every year, to be spent in seeing Italy,\r\nwhich she did not know at all; she would visit Naples, Florence, Rome.\r\nNow nothing in the world was more capable of distressing the Prince than\r\nan apparent desertion of this sort; it was one of his most pronounced\r\nweaknesses, any action that might be interpreted as showing contempt for\r\nhis capital city pierced him to the heart. He felt that he had no way of\r\nholding Signora Sanseverina, and Signora Sanseverina was by far the most\r\nbrilliant woman in Parma. A thing without parallel in the lazy Italian\r\ncharacter, people used to drive in from the surrounding country to\r\nattend her _Thursdays_; they were regular festivals; almost every week\r\nthe Duchessa had something new and sensational to present. The Prince\r\nwas dying to see one of these Thursdays for himself; but how was it to\r\nbe managed? Go to the house of a private citizen! That was a thing that\r\nneither his father nor he had ever done in their lives!\r\n\r\nThere came a certain Thursday of cold wind and rain; all through the\r\nevening the Prince heard carriages rattling over the pavement of the\r\npiazza outside the Palace, on their way to Signora Sanseverina\'s. He\r\nmoved petulantly in his chair: other people were amusing themselves, and\r\nhe, their sovereign Prince, their absolute master, who ought to find\r\nmore amusement than anyone in the world, he was tasting the fruit of\r\nboredom! He rang for his aide-de-camp: he was obliged to wait until a\r\ndozen trustworthy men had been posted in the street that led from the\r\nRoyal Palace to the _palazzo_ Sanseverina. Finally, after an hour that\r\nseemed to the Prince an age, during which he had been minded a score of\r\ntimes to brave the assassins\' daggers and to go boldly out without any\r\nprecaution, he appeared in the first of Signora Sanseverina\'s\r\ndrawing-rooms. A thunderbolt might have fallen upon the carpet and not\r\nproduced so much surprise. In the twinkling of an eye, and as the Prince\r\nadvanced through them, these gay and noisy rooms were hushed to a\r\nstupefied silence; every eye, fixed on the Prince, was strained with\r\nattention. The courtiers appeared disconcerted; the Duchessa alone\r\nshewed no sign of surprise. When finally her guests had recovered\r\nsufficient strength to speak, the great preoccupation of all present was\r\nto decide the important question: had the Duchessa been warned of this\r\nvisit, or had she like everyone else been taken by surprise?\r\n\r\nThe Prince was amused, and the reader may now judge of the utterly\r\nimpulsive character of the Duchessa, and of the boundless power which\r\nvague ideas of departure, adroitly disseminated, had enabled her to\r\nassume.\r\n\r\nAs she went to the door with the Prince, who was making her the\r\nprettiest speeches, an odd idea came to her which she ventured to put\r\ninto words quite simply, and as though it were the most natural thing in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n"If Your Serene Highness would address to the Princess three or four of\r\nthese charming utterances which he lavishes on me, he could be far more\r\ncertain of giving me pleasure than by telling me that I am pretty. I\r\nmean that I would not for anything in the world have the Princess look\r\nwith an unfriendly eye on the signal mark of his favour with which His\r\nHighness has honoured me this evening."\r\n\r\nThe Prince looked fixedly at her and replied in a dry tone:\r\n\r\n"I was under the impression that I was my own master and could go where\r\nI pleased."\r\n\r\nThe Duchessa blushed.\r\n\r\n"I wished only," she explained, instantly recovering herself, "not to\r\nexpose His Highness to the risk of a bootless errand, for this Thursday\r\nwill be the last; I am going for a few days to Bologna or Florence."\r\n\r\nWhen she reappeared in the rooms, everyone imagined her to be at the\r\nheight of favour, whereas she had just taken a risk upon which, in the\r\nmemory of man, no one had ever ventured. She made a sign to the Conte,\r\nwho rose from the whist-table and followed her into a little room that\r\nwas lighted but empty.\r\n\r\n"You have done a very bold thing," he informed her; "I should not have\r\nadvised it myself, but when hearts are really inflamed," he added with a\r\nsmile, "happiness enhances love, and if you leave to-morrow morning, I\r\nshall follow you to-morrow night. I shall be detained here only by that\r\nburden of a Ministry of Finance which I was stupid enough to take on my\r\nshoulders; but in four hours of hard work, one can hand over a good many\r\naccounts. Let us go back, dear friend, and play at ministerial fatuity\r\nwith all freedom and without reserve; it may be the last performance\r\nthat we shall give in this town. If he thinks he is being defied, the\r\nman is capable of anything; he will call it _making an example_. When\r\nthese people have gone, we can decide on a way of barricading you for\r\nto-night; the best plan perhaps would be to set off without delay for\r\nyour house at Sacca, by the Po, which has the advantage of being within\r\nhalf an hour of Austrian territory."\r\n\r\nFor the Duchessa\'s love and self-esteem this was an exquisite moment;\r\nshe looked at the Conte, and her eyes brimmed with tears. So powerful a\r\nMinister, surrounded by this swarm of courtiers who loaded him with\r\nhomage equal to that which they paid to the Prince himself, to leave\r\neverything for her sake, and with such unconcern!\r\n\r\nWhen she returned to the drawing-room she was beside herself with joy.\r\nEveryone bowed down before her.\r\n\r\n"How prosperity has changed the Duchessa!" was murmured everywhere by\r\nthe courtiers, "one would hardly recognise her. So that Roman spirit, so\r\nsuperior to everything in the world, does after all, deign to appreciate\r\nthe extraordinary favour that has just been conferred upon her by the\r\nSovereign!"\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the evening the Conte came to her: "I must tell you\r\nthe latest news." Immediately the people who happened to be standing\r\nnear the Duchessa withdrew.\r\n\r\n"The Prince, on his return to the Palace," the Conte went on, "had\r\nhimself announced at the door of his wife\'s room. Imagine the surprise!\r\n\'I have come to tell you,\' he said to her, \'about a really most\r\ndelightful evening I have spent at the Sanseverina\'s. It was she who\r\nasked me to give you a full description of the way in which she has\r\ndecorated that grimy old _palazzo_.\' Then the Prince took a seat and\r\nwent into a description of each of your rooms in turn.\r\n\r\n"He spent more than twenty-five minutes with his wife, who was in tears\r\nof joy; for all her intelligence, she could not think of anything to\r\nkeep the conversation going in the light tone which His Highness was\r\npleased to impart to it."\r\n\r\nThis Prince was by no means a wicked man, whatever the Liberals of Italy\r\nmight say of him. As a matter of fact, he had cast a good number of them\r\ninto prison, but that was from fear, and he used to repeat now and then,\r\nas though to console himself for certain unpleasant memories: "It is\r\nbetter to kill the devil than to let the devil kill you." The day after\r\nthe party we have been describing, he was supremely happy; he had done\r\ntwo good actions: he had gone to the _Thursday_, and he had talked to\r\nhis wife. At dinner, he addressed her again; in a word, this _Thursday_\r\nat Signora Sanseverina\'s brought about a domestic revolution with which\r\nthe whole of Parma rang; the Raversi was in consternation, and the\r\nDuchessa doubly delighted: she had contrived to be of use to her lover,\r\nand had found him more in love with her than ever.\r\n\r\n"All this owing to a thoroughly rash idea which came into my mind!" she\r\nsaid to the Conte. "I should be more free, no doubt, in Rome or Naples,\r\nbut should I find so fascinating a game to play there? No, indeed, my\r\ndear Conte, and you provide me with all my joy in life."\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: In Italy, young men with influence or brains become\r\n_Monsignori_ and _prelati_, which does not mean bishop; they then wear\r\nviolet stockings. A man need not take any vows to become _Monsignore_;\r\nhe can discard his violet stockings and marry.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is with trifling details of court life as insignificant as those\r\nrelated in the last chapter that we should have to fill up the history\r\nof the next four years. Every spring the Marchesa came with her\r\ndaughters to spend a couple of months at the _palazzo_ Sanseverina or on\r\nthe property of Sacca, by the bank of the Po; there they spent some very\r\npleasant hours and used to talk of Fabrizio, but the Conte would never\r\nallow him to pay a single visit to Parma. The Duchessa and the Minister\r\nhad indeed to make amends for certain acts of folly, but on the whole\r\nFabrizio followed soberly enough the line of conduct that had been laid\r\ndown for him: that of a great nobleman who is studying theology and does\r\nnot rely entirely on his virtues to bring him advancement. At Naples, he\r\nhad acquired a keen interest in the study of antiquity, he made\r\nexcavations; this new passion had almost taken the place of his passion\r\nfor horses. He had sold his English thoroughbreds in order to continue\r\nhis excavations at Miseno, where he had turned up a bust of Tiberius as\r\na young man which had been classed among the finest relics of antiquity.\r\nThe discovery of this bust was almost the keenest pleasure that had come\r\nto him at Naples. He had too lofty a nature to seek to copy the other\r\nyoung men he saw, to wish for example to play with any degree of\r\nseriousness the part of lover. Of course he never lacked mistresses, but\r\nthese were of no consequence to him, and, in spite of his years, one\r\nmight say of him that he still knew nothing of love: he was all the more\r\nloved on that account. Nothing prevented him from behaving with the most\r\nperfect coolness, for to him a young and pretty woman was always\r\nequivalent to any other young and pretty woman; only the latest comer\r\nseemed to him the most exciting. One of the most generally admired\r\nladies in Naples had done all sorts of foolish things in his honour\r\nduring the last year of his stay there, which at first had amused him,\r\nand had ended by boring him to tears, so much so that one of the joys of\r\nhis departure was the prospect of being delivered from the attentions of\r\nthe charming Duchessa d\'A----. It was in 1821 that, having\r\nsatisfactorily passed all his examinations, his director of studies, or\r\ngovernor, received a Cross and a gratuity, and he himself started out to\r\nsee at length that city of Parma of which he had often dreamed. He was\r\n_Monsignore_, and he had four horses drawing his carriage; at the stage\r\nbefore Parma he took only two, and on entering the town made them stop\r\noutside the church of San Giovanni. There was to be found the costly\r\ntomb of Archbishop Ascanio del Dongo, his great-granduncle, the author\r\nof the Latin genealogy. He prayed beside the tomb, then went on foot to\r\nthe _palazzo_ of the Duchessa, who did not expect him until several days\r\nlater. There was a large crowd in her drawing-room; presently they were\r\nleft alone.\r\n\r\n"Well, are you satisfied with me?" he asked her as he flung himself into\r\nher arms; "thanks to you, I have spent four quite happy years at Naples,\r\ninstead of eating my head off at Novara with my mistress authorised by\r\nthe police."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE COURT_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duchessa could not get over her astonishment; she would not have\r\nknown him had she seen him go by in the street; she discovered him to\r\nbe, what as a matter of fact he was, one of the best-looking men in\r\nItaly; his physiognomy in particular was charming. She had sent him to\r\nNaples a devil-may-care young rough-rider; the horsewhip he invariably\r\ncarried at that time had seemed an inherent part of his person: now he\r\nhad the noblest and most measured bearing before strangers, while in\r\nprivate conversation she found that he had retained all the ardour of\r\nhis boyhood. This was a diamond that had lost nothing by being polished.\r\nFabrizio had not been in the room an hour when Conte Mosca appeared; he\r\narrived a little too soon. The young man spoke to him with so apt a\r\nchoice of terms of the Cross of Parma that had been conferred on his\r\ngovernor, and expressed his lively gratitude for certain other benefits\r\nof which he did not venture to speak in so open a fashion, with so\r\nperfect a restraint, that at the first glance the Minister formed an\r\nexcellent impression of him. "This nephew," he murmured to the Duchessa,\r\n"is made to adorn all the exalted posts to which you will raise him in\r\ndue course." So far, all had gone wonderfully well, but when the\r\nMinister, thoroughly satisfied with Fabrizio, and paying attention so\r\nfar only to his actions and gestures, turned to the Duchessa, he noticed\r\na curious look in her eyes. "This young man is making a strange\r\nimpression here," he said to himself. This reflexion was bitter; the\r\nConte had reached the _fifties_, a cruel word of which perhaps only a\r\nman desperately in love can feel the full force. He was a thoroughly\r\ngood man, thoroughly deserving to be loved, apart from his severities as\r\na Minister. But in his eyes that cruel word _fifties_ threw a dark cloud\r\nover his whole life and might well have made him cruel on his own\r\naccount. In the five years since he had persuaded the Duchessa to settle\r\nat Parma, she had often aroused his jealousy, especially at first, but\r\nnever had she given him any real grounds for complaint. He believed\r\nindeed, and rightly, that it was with the object of making herself more\r\ncertain of his heart that the Duchessa had had recourse to those\r\napparent bestowals of her favour upon various young _beaux_ of the\r\ncourt. He was sure, for instance, that she had rejected the offers of\r\nthe Prince, who, indeed, on that occasion, had made a significant\r\nutterance.\r\n\r\n"But if I were to accept Your Highness\'s offer," the Duchessa had said\r\nto him with a smile, "how should I ever dare to look the Conte in the\r\nface afterwards?"\r\n\r\n"I should be almost as much out of countenance as you. The dear Conte!\r\nMy friend! But there is a very easy way out of that difficulty, and I\r\nhave thought of it: the Conte would be put in the citadel for the rest\r\nof his days."\r\n\r\nAt the moment of Fabrizio\'s arrival, the Duchessa was so beside herself\r\nwith joy that she never even thought of the ideas which the look in her\r\neyes might put into the Conte\'s head. The effect was profound and the\r\nsuspicions it aroused irremediable.\r\n\r\nFabrizio was received by the Prince two hours after his arrival; the\r\nDuchessa, foreseeing the good effect which this impromptu audience would\r\nhave on the public, had been begging for it for the last two months;\r\nthis favour put Fabrizio beyond all rivalry from the first; the pretext\r\nfor it had been that he would only be passing through Parma on his way\r\nto visit his mother in Piedmont. At the moment when a charming little\r\nnote from the Duchessa arrived to inform the Prince that Fabrizio\r\nawaited his orders, the Prince was feeling bored. "I shall see," he said\r\nto himself, "a saintly little simpleton, a mean or a sly face." The Town\r\nCommandant had already reported the newcomer\'s first visit to the tomb\r\nof his archi\xc3\xa9piscopal uncle. The Prince saw enter the room a tall young\r\nman whom, but for his violet stockings, he would have taken for some\r\nyoung officer.\r\n\r\nThis little surprise dispelled his boredom: "Here is a fellow," he said\r\nto himself, "for whom they will be asking me heaven knows what favours,\r\neverything that I have to bestow. He is just come, he probably feels\r\nnervous: I shall give him a little dose of Jacobin politics; we shall\r\nsee how he replies."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A FIRST AUDIENCE_\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the first gracious words on the Prince\'s part:\r\n\r\n"Well, _Monsignore_," he said to Fabrizio, "and the people of Naples, are\r\nthey happy? Is the King loved?"\r\n\r\n"Serene Highness," Fabrizio replied without a moment\'s hesitation, "I\r\nused to admire, when they passed me in the street, the excellent bearing\r\nof the troops of the various regiments of His Majesty the King; the\r\nbetter classes are respectful towards their masters, as they ought to\r\nbe; but I must confess that, all my life, I have never allowed the lower\r\norders to speak to me about anything but the work for which I am paying\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"Plague!" said the Prince, "what a _slyboots_! This is a well-trained\r\nbird, I recognise the Sanseverina touch." Becoming interested, the\r\nPrince employed great skill in leading Fabrizio on to discuss this\r\nscabrous topic. The young man, animated by the danger he was in, was so\r\nfortunate as to hit upon some admirable rejoinders: "It is almost\r\ninsolence to boast of one\'s love for one\'s King," he said; "it is blind\r\nobedience that one owes to him." At the sight of so much prudence the\r\nPrince almost lost his temper: "Here, it seems, is a man of parts come\r\namong us from Naples, and I don\'t like _that breed_; a man of parts may\r\nfollow the highest principles and even be quite sincere; all the same on\r\none side or the other he is always first cousin to Voltaire and\r\nRousseau."\r\n\r\nThis Prince felt himself almost defied by such correctness of manner and\r\nsuch unassailable rejoinders coming from a youth fresh from college;\r\nwhat he had expected never occurred; in an instant he assumed a tone of\r\ngood-fellowship and, reverting in a few words to the basic principles of\r\nsociety and government, repeated, adapting them to the matter in hand,\r\ncertain phrases of F\xc3\xa9nelon which he had been made to learn by heart in\r\nhis boyhood for use in public audiences.\r\n\r\n"These principles surprise you, young man," he said to Fabrizio (he had\r\ncalled him _Monsignore_ at the beginning of the audience, and intended\r\nto give him his _Monsignore_ again in dismissing him, but in the course\r\nof the conversation he felt it to be more adroit, better suited to\r\nmoving turns of speech, to address him in an informal and friendly\r\nstyle). "These principles surprise you, young man. I admit that they\r\nbear little resemblance to the _bread and butter absolutism_" (this was\r\nthe expression in use) "which you can read every day in my official\r\nnewspaper. . . . But, great heavens, what is the good of my quoting that\r\nto you? Those writers in my newspaper must be quite unknown to you."\r\n\r\n"I beg Your Serene Highness\'s pardon; not only do I read the Parma\r\nnewspaper, which seems to me to be very well written, but I hold,\r\nmoreover, with it, that everything that has been done since the death of\r\nLouis XIV, in 1715, has been at once criminal and foolish. Man\'s chief\r\ninterest in life is his own salvation, there can be no two ways of\r\nlooking at it, and that is a happiness that lasts for eternity. The\r\nwords _Liberty_, _Justice_, the _Good of the Greatest Number_, are\r\ninfamous and criminal: they form in people\'s minds the habits of\r\ndiscussion and want of confidence. A Chamber of Deputies votes _no\r\nconfidence_ in what these people call _the Ministry_. This fatal habit\r\nof _want of confidence_ once contracted, human weakness applies it to\r\neverything, man loses confidence in the Bible, the Orders of the Church,\r\nTradition and everything else; from that moment he is lost. Even upon\r\nthe assumption--which is abominably false, and criminal even to\r\nsuggest--that this want of confidence in the authority of the Princes by\r\nGod _established_ were to secure one\'s happiness during the twenty or\r\nthirty years of life which any of us may expect to enjoy, what is half a\r\ncentury, or a whole century even, compared with an eternity of torment?"\r\nAnd so on.\r\n\r\nOne could see, from the way in which Fabrizio spoke, that he was seeking\r\nto arrange his ideas so that they should be grasped as quickly as\r\npossible by his listener; it was clear that he was not simply repeating\r\na lesson.\r\n\r\nPresently the Prince lost interest in his contest with this young man\r\nwhose simple and serious manner had begun to irritate him.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, _Monsignore_," he said to him abruptly, "I can see that they\r\nprovide an excellent education at the Ecclesiastical Academy of Naples,\r\nand it is quite simple when these good precepts fall upon so\r\ndistinguished a mind, one secures brilliant results. Good-bye." And he\r\nturned his back on him.\r\n\r\n"I have quite failed to please this animal," thought Fabrizio.\r\n\r\n"And now, it remains to be seen," said the Prince as soon as he was once\r\nmore alone, "whether this fine youngman is capable of passion for\r\nanything; in that case, he would be complete. . . . Could anyone repeat\r\nwith more spirit the lessons he has learned from his aunt? I felt I\r\ncould hear her speaking; should we have a revolution here, it would be\r\nshe that would edit the _Monitore_, as the Sanfelice did at Naples! But\r\nthe Sanfelice, in spite of her twenty-five summers and her beauty, got a\r\nbit of a hanging all the same! A warning to women with brains." In\r\nsupposing Fabrizio to be his aunt\'s pupil, the Prince was mistaken:\r\npeople with brains who are born on the throne or at the foot of it soon\r\nlose all fineness of touch; they proscribe, in their immediate circle,\r\nfreedom of conversation which seems to them coarseness; they refuse to\r\nlook at anything but masks and pretend to judge the beauty of\r\ncomplexions; the amusing part of it is that they imagine their touch to\r\nbe of the finest. In this case, for instance, Fabrizio believed\r\npractically everything that we have heard him say; it is true that he\r\ndid not think twice in a month of these great principles. He had keen\r\nappetites, he had brains, but he had faith.\r\n\r\nThe desire for liberty, the fashion and cult of the _greatest good of\r\nthe greatest number_, after which the nineteenth century has run mad,\r\nwere nothing in his eyes but a heresy which, like other heresies, would\r\npass away, though not until it had destroyed many souls, as the plague\r\nwhile it reigns unchecked in a country destroys many bodies. And in\r\nspite of all this Fabrizio read the French, newspapers with keen\r\nenjoyment, even taking rash steps to procure them.\r\n\r\nFabrizio having returned quite flustered from his audience at the\r\nPalace, and having told his aunt of the various attacks launched at him\r\nby the Prince:\r\n\r\n"You ought," she told him, "to go at once to see Father Landriani, our\r\nexcellent Archbishop; go there on foot; climb the staircase quietly,\r\nmake as little noise as possible in the ante-rooms; if you are kept\r\nwaiting, so much the better, a thousand times better! In a word, be\r\n_apostolic_!"\r\n\r\n"I understand," said Fabrizio, "our man is a Tartuffe."\r\n\r\n"Not the least bit in the world, he is virtue incarnate."\r\n\r\n"Even after the way he behaved," said Fabrizio in some bewilderment,\r\n"when Conte Palanza was executed?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE ARCHBISHOP_\r\n\r\n\r\n"Yes, my friend, after the way he behaved: the father of our Archbishop\r\nwas a clerk in the Ministry of Finance, a man of humble position, and\r\nthat explains everything. Monsignor Landriani is a man of keen,\r\nextensive and deep intelligence; he is sincere, he loves virtue; I am\r\nconvinced that if an Emperor Decius were to reappear in the world he\r\nwould undergo martyrdom like Polyeuctes in the opera they played last\r\nweek. So much for the good side of the medal, now for the reverse: as\r\nsoon as he enters the Sovereign\'s, or even the Prime Minister\'s\r\npresence, he is dazzled by the sight of such greatness, he becomes\r\nconfused, he begins to blush; it is physically impossible for him to say\r\nno. This accounts for the things he has done, things which have won him\r\nthat cruel reputation throughout Italy; but what is not generally known\r\nis that, when public opinion had succeeded in enlightening him as to the\r\ntrial of Conte Palanza, he set himself the penance of living upon bread\r\nand water for thirteen weeks, the same number of weeks as there are\r\nletters in the name _Davide Palanza_. We have at this court a rascal of\r\ninfinite cleverness named _Rassi_, a Chief Justice or Fiscal General,\r\nwho at the time of Conte Palanza\'s death, cast a spell over Father\r\nLandriani. During his thirteen weeks\' penance, Conte Mosca, from pity\r\nand also a little out of malice, used to ask him to dinner once and even\r\ntwice a week: the good Archbishop, in deference to his host, ate like\r\neveryone else; he would have thought it rebellious and Jacobinical to\r\nmake a public display of his penance for an action that had the\r\nSovereign\'s approval. But we knew that, for each dinner at which his\r\nduty as a loyal subject had obliged him to eat like everyone else, he\r\nset himself a penance of two days more of bread and water.\r\n\r\n"Monsignor Landriani, a man of superior intellect, a scholar of the\r\nfirst order, has only one weakness: _he likes to be loved_: therefore,\r\ngrow affectionate as you look at him, and, on your third visit, shew\r\nyour love for him outright. That, added to your birth, will make him\r\nadore you at once. Show no sign of surprise if he accompanies you to the\r\nhead of the staircase, assume an air of being accustomed to such\r\nmanners: he is a man who was born on his knees before the nobility. For\r\nthe rest, be simple, apostolic, no cleverness, no brilliance, no prompt\r\nrepartee; if you do not startle him at all, he will be delighted with\r\nyou; do not forget that it must be on his own initiative that he makes\r\nyou his Grand Vicar. The Conte and I will be surprised and even annoyed\r\nat so rapid an advancement; that is essential in dealing with the\r\nSovereign."\r\n\r\nFabrizio hastened to the Archbishop\'s Palace: by a singular piece of\r\ngood fortune, the worthy prelate\'s footman, who was slightly deaf, did\r\nnot catch the name _del Dongo_; he announced a young priest named\r\nFabrizio; the Archbishop happened to be closeted with a parish priest of\r\nby no means exemplary morals, for whom he had sent in order to scold\r\nhim. He was in the act of delivering a reprimand, a most painful thing\r\nfor him, and did not wish to be distressed by it longer than was\r\nnecessary; accordingly he kept waiting for three quarters of an hour the\r\ngreat-nephew of the Archbishop Ascanio del Dongo.\r\n\r\nHow are we to depict his apologies and despair when, after having\r\nconducted the priest to the farthest ante-room, and on asking, as he\r\nreturned, the man who was waiting _what he could do to serve him_, he\r\ncaught sight of the violet stockings and heard the name Fabrizio del\r\nDongo? This accident seemed to our hero so fortunate that on this first\r\nvisit he ventured to kiss the saintly prelate\'s hand, in a transport of\r\naffection. He was obliged to hear the Archbishop repeat in a tone of\r\ndespair: "A del Dongo kept waiting in my ante-room!" The old man felt\r\nobliged, by way of apology, to relate to him the whole story of the\r\nparish priest, his misdeeds, his replies to the charges, and so forth.\r\n\r\n"Is it really possible," Fabrizio asked himself as he made his way back\r\nto the _palazzo_ Sanseverina, "that this is the man who hurried on the\r\nexecution of that poor Conte Palanza?"\r\n\r\n"What is Your Excellency\'s impression?" Conte Mosca, inquired with a\r\nsmile, as he saw him enter the Duchessa\'s drawing-room. (The Conte would\r\nnot allow Fabrizio to address him as Excellency.)\r\n\r\n"I have fallen from the clouds; I know nothing at all about human\r\nnature: I would have wagered, had I not known his name, that man\r\ncould not bear to see a chicken bleed."\r\n\r\n"And you would have won your wager," replied the Conte; "but when he is\r\nwith the Prince, or merely with myself, he cannot say no. To be quite\r\nhonest, in order for me to create my full effect, I have to slip the\r\nyellow riband of my Grand Cordon over my coat; in plain evening dress he\r\nwould contradict me, and so I always put on a uniform to receive him. It\r\nis not for us to destroy the prestige of power, the French newspapers\r\nare demolishing it quite fast enough; it is doubtful whether the _mania\r\nof respect_ will last out our time, and you, my dear nephew, will\r\noutlive respect altogether. You will be simply a fellow-man!"\r\n\r\nFabrizio delighted greatly in the Conte\'s society; he was the first\r\nsuperior person who had condescended to talk to him frankly, without\r\nmake-believe; moreover they had a taste in common, that for antiquities\r\nand excavations. The Conte, for his part, was flattered by the extreme\r\nattention with which the young man listened to him; but there was one\r\nparamount objection: Fabrizio occupied a set of rooms in the _palazzo_\r\nSanseverina, spent his whole time with the Duchessa, let it be seen in\r\nall innocence that this intimacy constituted his happiness in life, and\r\nFabrizio had eyes and a complexion of a freshness that drove the older\r\nman to despair.\r\n\r\nFor a long time past Ranuccio-Ernesto IV, who rarely encountered a cruel\r\nfair, had felt it to be an affront that the Duchessa\'s virtue, which was\r\nwell known at court, had not made an exception in his favour. As we have\r\nseen, the mind and the presence of mind of Fabrizio had shocked him at\r\ntheir first encounter. He took amiss the extreme friendship which\r\nFabrizio and his aunt heedlessly displayed in public; he gave ear with\r\nthe closest attention to the remarks of his courtiers, which were\r\nendless. The arrival of this young man and the unprecedented audience\r\nwhich he had obtained provided the court with news and a sensation for\r\nthe next month; which gave the Prince an idea.\r\n\r\nHe had in his guard a private soldier who carried his wine in the most\r\nadmirable way; this man spent his time in the _trattorie_, and reported\r\nthe spirit of the troops directly to his Sovereign. Carlone lacked\r\neducation, otherwise he would long since have obtained promotion. Well,\r\nhis duty was to be in the Palace every day when the strokes of twelve\r\nsounded on the great clock. The Prince went in person a little before\r\nnoon to arrange in a certain way the shutters of a _mezzanino_\r\ncommunicating with the room in which His Highness dressed. He returned\r\nto this _mezzanino_ shortly after twelve had struck, and there found the\r\nsoldier; the Prince had in his pocket writing materials and a sheet of\r\npaper; he dictated to the soldier the following letter:\r\n\r\n"Your Excellency has great intelligence, doubtless, and it is thanks to\r\nhis profound sagacity that we see this State so well governed. But, my\r\ndear Conte, such great success never comes unaccompanied by a little\r\nenvy, and I am seriously afraid that people will be laughing a little at\r\nyour expense if your sagacity does not discern that a certain handsome\r\nyoung man has had the good fortune to inspire, unintentionally it may\r\nbe, a passion of the most singular order. This happy mortal is, they\r\nsay, only twenty-three years old, and, dear Conte, what complicates the\r\nquestion is that you and I are considerably more than twice that age. In\r\nthe evening, at a certain distance, the Conte is charming,\r\nscintillating, a wit, as attractive as possible; but in the morning, in\r\nan intimate scene, all things considered, the newcomer has perhaps\r\ngreater attractions. Well, we poor women, we make a great point of this\r\nyouthful freshness, especially when we have ourselves passed thirty. Is\r\nthere not some talk already of settling this charming youth at our\r\ncourt, in some fine post? And if so, who is the person who speaks of it\r\nmost frequently to Your Excellency?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A LETTER_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prince took the letter and gave the soldier two scudi.\r\n\r\n"This is in addition to your pay," he said in a grim tone. "Not a single\r\nword of this to anyone, or you will find yourself in the dampest dungeon\r\nin the citadel." The Prince had in his desk a collection of envelopes\r\nbearing the addresses of most of the persons at his court, in the\r\nhandwriting of this same soldier who was understood to be illiterate,\r\nand never even wrote out his own police reports: the Prince picked out\r\nthe one he required.\r\n\r\nA few hours later, Conte Mosca received a letter by post; the hour of\r\nits delivery had been calculated, and just as the postman, who had been\r\nseen going in with a small envelope in his hand, came out of the\r\nministerial palace, Mosca was summoned to His Highness. Never had the\r\nfavourite appeared to be in the grip of a blacker melancholy: to enjoy\r\nthis at his leisure, the Prince called out to him, as he saw him come\r\nin:\r\n\r\n"I want to amuse myself by talking casually to my friend and not working\r\nwith my Minister. I have a maddening headache this evening, and all\r\nsorts of gloomy thoughts keep coming into my mind."\r\n\r\nI need hardly mention the abominable ill-humour which agitated the Prime\r\nMinister, Conte Mosca della Rovere, when at length he was permitted to\r\ntake leave of his august master. Ranuccio-Ernesto IV was a past-master\r\nin the art of torturing a heart, and it would not be unfair at this\r\npoint to make the comparison of the tiger which loves to play with its\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\nThe Conte made his coachman drive him home at a gallop; he called out as\r\nhe crossed the threshold that not a living soul was to be allowed\r\nupstairs, sent word to the _auditor_ on duty that he might take himself\r\noff (the knowledge that there was a human being within earshot was\r\nhateful to him), and hastened to shut himself up in the great picture\r\ngallery. There at length he could give full vent to his fury; there he\r\nspent an hour without lights, wandering about the room like a man out of\r\nhis mind. He sought to impose silence on his heart, to concentrate all\r\nthe force of his attention upon deliberating what action he ought to\r\ntake. Plunged in an anguish that would have moved to pity his most\r\nimplacable enemy, he said to himself: "The man I abhor is living in the\r\nDuchessa\'s house; he spends every hour of the day with her. Ought I to\r\ntry to make one of her women speak? Nothing could be more dangerous; she\r\nis so good to them; she pays them well; she is adored by them (and by\r\nwhom, great God, is she not adored?)! The question is," he continued,\r\nraging: "Ought I to let her detect the jealousy that is devouring me, or\r\nnot to speak of it?\r\n\r\n"If I remain silent, she will make no attempt to keep anything from me.\r\nI know Gina, she is a woman who acts always on the first impulse; her\r\nconduct is incalculable, even by herself; if she tries to plan out a\r\ncourse in advance, she goes all wrong; invariably, when it is time for\r\naction, a new idea comes into her head which she follows rapturously as\r\nthough it were the most wonderful thing in the world, and upsets\r\neverything.\r\n\r\n"If I make no mention of my suffering, nothing will be kept back from\r\nme, and I shall see all that goes on. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_NIGHT THOUGHTS_\r\n\r\n\r\n"Yes, but by speaking I bring about a change of circumstances: I make\r\nher reflect; I give her fair warning of all the horrible things that may\r\nhappen. . . . Perhaps she will send him away" (the Conte breathed a sigh\r\nof relief), "then I shall practically have won; even allowing her to be\r\na little out of temper for the moment, I shall soothe her . . . and a\r\nlittle ill-temper, what could be more natural? . . . she has loved him\r\nlike a son for fifteen years. There lies all my hope: _like a son_ . . .\r\nbut she had ceased to see him after his dash to Waterloo; now, on his\r\nreturn from Naples, especially for her, he is a different man. _A\r\ndifferent man!_" he repeated with fury, "and that man is charming; he\r\nhas, apart from everything else, that simple and tender air and that\r\nsmiling eye which hold out such a promise of happiness! And those\r\neyes--the Duchessa cannot be accustomed to see eyes like those at this\r\ncourt! . . . Our substitute for them is a gloomy or sardonic stare. I\r\nmyself, pursued everywhere by official business, governing only by my\r\ninfluence over a man who would like to turn me to ridicule, what a look\r\nthere must often be in mine! Ah! whatever pains I may take to conceal\r\nit, it is in my eyes that age will always shew. My gaiety, does it not\r\nalways border upon irony? . . . I will go farther, I must be sincere\r\nwith myself; does not my gaiety allow a glimpse to be caught, as of\r\nsomething quite close to it, of absolute power . . . and\r\nirresponsibility? Do I not sometimes say to myself, especially when\r\npeople irritate me: \'I can do what I like!\' and indeed go on to say what\r\nis foolish: \'I ought to be happier than other men, since I possess what\r\nothers have not, sovereign power in three things out of four . . .?\'\r\nVery well, let us be just! The habit of thinking thus must affect my\r\nsmile, must give me a selfish, satisfied air. And, how charming his\r\nsmile is! It breathes the easy happiness of extreme youth, and engenders\r\nit."\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the Conte, the weather that evening was hot, stifling,\r\nwith the threat of a storm in the air; the sort of weather, in short,\r\nthat in those parts carries people to extremes. How am I to find space\r\nfor all the arguments, all the ways of looking at what was happening to\r\nhim which, for three mortal hours on end, kept this impassioned man in\r\ntorment? At length the side of prudence prevailed, solely as a result of\r\nthis reflexion: "I am in all probability mad; when I think I am\r\nreasoning, I am not, I am simply turning about in search of a less\r\npainful position, I pass by without seeing it some decisive argument.\r\nSince I am blinded by excessive grief, let us obey the rule, approved by\r\nevery sensible man, which is called _Prudence_.\r\n\r\n"Besides, once I have uttered the fatal word _jealousy_, my course is\r\ntraced for me for ever. If on the contrary I say nothing to-day, I can\r\nspeak to-morrow, I remain master of the situation." The crisis was too\r\nacute; the Conte would have gone mad had it continued. He was comforted\r\nfor a few moments, his attention came to rest on the anonymous letter.\r\nFrom whose hand could it have come? There followed then a search for\r\npossible names, and a personal judgment of each, which created a\r\ndiversion. In the end, the Conte remembered a gleam of malice that had\r\ndarted from the eyes of the Sovereign, when it had occurred to him to\r\nsay, towards the end of the audience: "Yes, dear friend, let us be\r\nagreed on this point: the pleasures and cares of the most amply rewarded\r\nambition, even of unbounded power, are as nothing compared with the\r\nintimate happiness that is afforded by relations of affection and love.\r\nI am a man first, and a Prince afterwards, and, when I have the good\r\nfortune to be in love, my mistress speaks to the man and not to the\r\nPrince." The Conte compared that moment of malicious joy with the phrase\r\nin the letter; "It is thanks to your profound sagacity that we see this\r\nState so well governed." "Those are the Prince\'s words!" he exclaimed,\r\n"in a courtier they would be a gratuitous piece of imprudence; the\r\nletter comes from His Highness."\r\n\r\nThis problem solved, the faint joy caused by the pleasure of guessing\r\nthe solution was soon effaced by the cruel spectre of the charming\r\ngraces of Fabrizio, which returned afresh. It was like an enormous\r\nweight that fell back on the heart of the unhappy man. "What does it\r\nmatter from whom the anonymous letter comes?" he cried with fury, "does\r\nthe fact that it discloses to me exist any the less? This caprice may\r\nalter my whole life," he said, as though to excuse himself for being so\r\nmad. "At the first moment, if she cares for him in a certain way, she\r\nwill set off with him for Belgirate, for Switzerland, for the ends of\r\nthe earth. She is rich, and besides, even if she had to live on a few\r\nlouis a year, what would that matter to her? Did she not admit to me,\r\nnot a week ago, that her _palazzo_, so well arranged, so magnificent,\r\nbored her? Novelty is essential to so youthful a spirit! And with what\r\nsimplicity does this new form of happiness offer itself! She will be\r\ncarried away before she has begun to think of the danger, before she has\r\nbegun to think of being sorry for me! And yet I am so wretched!" cried\r\nthe Conte, bursting into tears.\r\n\r\nHe had sworn to himself that he would not go to the Duchessa\'s that\r\nevening; never had his eyes thirsted so to gaze on her. At midnight he\r\npresented himself at her door; he found her alone with her nephew; at\r\nten o\'clock she had sent all her guests away and had closed her door.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of the tender intimacy that prevailed between these two\r\ncreatures, and of the Duchessa\'s artless joy, a frightful difficulty\r\narose before the eyes of the Conte, and one that was quite unforeseen.\r\nHe had never thought of it during his long deliberation in the picture\r\ngallery: how was he to conceal his jealousy?\r\n\r\nNot knowing what pretext to adopt, he pretended that he had found the\r\nPrince that evening excessively ill-disposed towards him, contradicting\r\nall his assertions, and so forth. He had the distress of seeing the\r\nDuchessa barely listen to him, and pay no attention to these details\r\nwhich, forty-eight hours earlier, would have plunged her in an endless\r\nstream of discussion. The Conte looked at Fabrizio: never had that\r\nhandsome Lombard face appeared to him so simple and so noble! Fabrizio\r\npaid more attention than the Duchessa to the difficulties which he was\r\nrelating.\r\n\r\n"Really," he said to himself, "that head combines extreme good-nature\r\nwith the expression of a certain artless and tender joy which is\r\nirresistible. It seems to be saying: \'Love and the happiness it brings\r\nare the only serious things in this world.\' And yet, when one comes to\r\nsome detail which requires thought, the light wakes in his eyes and\r\nsurprises one, and one is left dumbfoundered.\r\n\r\n"Everything is simple in his eyes, because everything is seen from\r\nabove. Great God! how is one to fight against an enemy like this? And\r\nafter all, what is life without Gina\'s love? With what rapture she seems\r\nto be listening to the charming sallies of that mind, which is so boyish\r\nand must, to a woman, seem without a counterpart in the world!"\r\n\r\nAn atrocious thought gripped the Conte like a sudden cramp. "Shall I\r\nstab him here, before her face, and then kill myself?"\r\n\r\nHe took a turn through the room, his legs barely supporting him, but his\r\nhand convulsively gripping the hilt of his dagger. Neither of the others\r\npaid any attention to what he might be doing. He announced that he was\r\ngoing to give an order to his servant; they did not even hear him; the\r\nDuchessa was laughing tenderly at something Fabrizio had just said to\r\nher. The Conte went up to a lamp in the outer room, and looked to see\r\nwhether the point of his dagger was well sharpened. "One must behave\r\ngraciously, and with perfect manners to this young man," he said to\r\nhimself as he returned to the other room and went up to them.\r\n\r\nHe became quite mad; it seemed to him that, as they leaned their heads\r\ntogether, they were kissing each other, there, before his eyes. "That is\r\nimpossible in my presence," he told himself; "my wits have gone astray.\r\nI must calm myself; if I behave rudely, the Duchessa is quite capable,\r\nsimply out of injured vanity, of following him to Belgirate; and there,\r\nor on the way there, a chance word may be spoken which will give a name\r\nto what they now feel for one another; and after that, in a moment, all\r\nthe consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CECCHINA_\r\n\r\n\r\n"Solitude will render that word decisive, and besides, once the Duchessa\r\nhas left my side, what is to become of me? And if, after overcoming\r\nendless difficulties on the Prince\'s part, I go and shew my old and\r\nanxious face at Belgirate, what part shall I play before these people\r\nboth mad with happiness?\r\n\r\n"Here even what else am I than the _terzo incomodo_?" (That beautiful\r\nItalian language is simply made for love: _Terzo incomodo_, a third\r\nperson when two are company.) What misery for a man of spirit to feel\r\nthat he is playing that execrable part, and not to be able to muster the\r\nstrength to get up and leave the room!\r\n\r\nThe Conte was on the point of breaking out, or at least of betraying his\r\nanguish by the discomposure of his features. When in one of his circuits\r\nof the room he found himself near the door, he took his flight, calling\r\nout, in a genial, intimate tone: "Good-bye, you two!-- One must avoid\r\nbloodshed," he said to himself.\r\n\r\nThe day following this horrible evening, after a night spent half in\r\ncompiling a detailed sum of Fabrizio\'s advantages, half in the frightful\r\ntransports of the most cruel jealousy, it occurred to the Conte that he\r\nmight send for a young servant of his own; this man was keeping company\r\nwith a girl named Cecchina, one of the Duchessa\'s personal maids, and\r\nher favourite. As good luck would have it, this young man was very sober\r\nin his habits, indeed miserly, and was anxious to find a place as porter\r\nin one of the public _institutions_ of Parma. The Conte ordered the man to\r\nfetch Cecchina, his mistress, instantly. The man obeyed, and an hour\r\nlater the Conte appeared suddenly in the room where the girl was waiting\r\nwith her lover. The Conte frightened them both by the amount of gold\r\nthat he gave them, then he addressed these few words to the trembling\r\nCecchina, looking her straight in the face:\r\n\r\n"Is the Duchessa in love with Monsignore?"\r\n\r\n"No," said the girl, gaining courage to speak after a moment\'s silence.\r\n. . . "No, _not yet_, but he often kisses the Signora\'s hands, laughing,\r\nit is true, but with real feeling."\r\n\r\nThis evidence was completed by a hundred answers to as many furious\r\nquestions from the Conte; his uneasy passion made the poor couple earn\r\nin full measure the money that he had flung them: he ended by believing\r\nwhat they told him, and was less unhappy. "If the Duchessa ever has the\r\nslightest suspicion of what we have been saying," he told Cecchina, "I\r\nshall send your lover to spend twenty years in the fortress, and when\r\nyou see him again his hair will be quite white."\r\n\r\nSome days elapsed, during which Fabrizio in turn lost all his gaiety.\r\n\r\n"I assure you," he said to the Duchessa, "that Conte Mosca feels an\r\nantipathy for me."\r\n\r\n"So much the worse for His Excellency," she replied with a trace of\r\ntemper.\r\n\r\nThis was by no means the true cause of the uneasiness which had made\r\nFabrizio\'s gaiety vanish. "The position in which chance has placed me is\r\nnot tenable," he told himself. "I am quite sure that she will never say\r\nanything, she would be as much horrified by a too significant word as by\r\nan incestuous act. But if, one evening, after a rash and foolish day,\r\nshe should come to examine her conscience, if she believes that I may\r\nhave guessed the feeling that she seems to have formed for me, what part\r\nshould I then play in her eyes? Nothing more nor less than the _casto\r\nGiuseppe_!" (An Italian expression alluding to the ridiculous part\r\nplayed by Joseph with the wife of the eunuch Potiphar.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_UNCERTAINTIES_\r\n\r\n\r\n"Should I give her to understand by a fine burst of confidence that I am\r\nnot capable of serious affection? I have not the necessary strength of\r\nmind to announce such a fact so that it shall not be as like as two peas\r\nto a gross impertinence. The sole resource left to me is a great passion\r\nleft behind at Naples; in that case, I should return there for\r\ntwenty-four hours: such a course is wise, but is it really worth the\r\ntrouble? There remains a minor affair with some one of humble rank at\r\nParma, which might annoy her; but anything is preferable to the\r\nappalling position of a man who will not see the truth. This course may,\r\nit is true, prejudice my future; I should have, by the exercise of\r\nprudence and the purchase of discretion, to minimise the danger." What\r\nwas so cruel an element among all these thoughts was that really\r\nFabrizio loved the Duchessa far above anyone else in the world. "I must\r\nbe very clumsy," he told himself angrily, "to have such misgivings as to\r\nmy ability to persuade her of what is so glaringly true!" Lacking the\r\nskill to extricate himself from this position, he grew sombre and sad.\r\n"What would become of me, Great God, if I quarrelled with the one person\r\nin the world for whom I feel a passionate attachment?" From another\r\npoint of view, Fabrizio could not bring himself to spoil so delicious a\r\nhappiness by an indiscreet word. His position abounded so in charm! The\r\nintimate friendship of so beautiful and attractive a woman was so\r\npleasant! Under the most commonplace relations of life, her protection\r\ngave him so agreeable a position at this court, the great intrigues of\r\nwhich, thanks to her who explained them to him, were as amusing as a\r\nplay! "But at any moment I may be awakened by a thunderbolt," he said to\r\nhimself. "These gay, these tender evenings, passed almost in privacy\r\nwith so thrilling a woman, if they lead to something better, she will\r\nexpect to find in me a lover; she will call on me for frenzied raptures,\r\nfor acts of folly, and I shall never have anything more to offer her\r\nthan friendship, of the warmest kind, but without love; nature has not\r\nendowed me with that sort of sublime folly. What reproaches have I not\r\nhad to bear on that account! I can still hear the Duchessa d\'A----\r\nspeaking, and I used to laugh at the Duchessa! She will think that I am\r\nwanting in love for her, whereas it is love that is wanting in me; never\r\nwill she make herself understand me. Often after some story about the\r\ncourt, told by her with that grace, that abandonment which she alone in\r\nthe world possesses, and which is a necessary part of my education\r\nbesides, I kiss her hand and sometimes her cheek. What is to happen if\r\nthat hand presses mine in a certain fashion?"\r\n\r\nFabrizio put in an appearance every day in the most respectable and\r\nleast amusing drawing-rooms in Parma. Guided by the able advice of the\r\nDuchessa, he paid a sagacious court to the two Princes, father and son,\r\nto the Princess Clara-Paolina and Monsignore the Archbishop. He met with\r\nsuccesses, but these did not in the least console him for his mortal\r\nfear of falling out with the Duchessa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, less than a month after his arrival at court, Fabrizio had tasted\r\nall the sorrows of a courtier, and the intimate friendship which\r\nconstituted the happiness of his life was poisoned. One evening,\r\ntormented by these thoughts, he left that drawing-room of the Duchessa\r\nin which he had too much of the air of a reigning lover; wandering at\r\nrandom through the town, he came opposite the theatre, in which he saw\r\nlights; he went in. It was a gratuitous imprudence in a man of his cloth\r\nand one that he had indeed vowed that he would avoid in Parma, which,\r\nafter all, is only a small town of forty thousand inhabitants. It is\r\ntrue that after the first few days he had got rid of his official\r\ncostume; in the evenings, when he was not going into the very highest\r\nsociety, he used simply to dress in black like a layman in mourning.\r\n\r\nAt the theatre he took a box on the third tier, so as not to be noticed;\r\nthe play was Goldoni\'s _La Locanderia_. He examined the architecture of\r\nthe building, scarcely did he turn his eyes to the stage. But the\r\ncrowded audience kept bursting into laughter at every moment; Fabrizio\r\ngave a glance at the young actress who was playing the part of the\r\nlandlady, and found her amusing. He looked at her more closely; she\r\nseemed to him quite attractive, and, above all, perfectly natural; she\r\nwas a simple-minded young girl who was the first to laugh at the witty\r\nlines Goldoni had put into her mouth, lines which she appeared to be\r\nquite surprised to be uttering. He asked what her name was, and was\r\ntold: "Marietta Valserra."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" he thought; "she has taken my name; that is odd." In spite of his\r\nintentions he did not leave the theatre until the end of the piece. The\r\nfollowing evening he returned; three days later he knew Marietta\r\nValserra\'s address.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the day on which, with a certain amount of trouble, he\r\nhad procured this address, he noticed that the Conte was looking at him\r\nin the most friendly way. The poor jealous lover, who had all the\r\ntrouble in the world in keeping within the bounds of prudence, had set\r\nspies on the young man\'s track, and this theatrical escapade pleased\r\nhim. How are we to depict the Conte\'s joy when, on the day following\r\nthat on which he had managed to bring himself to look amicably at\r\nFabrizio, he learned that the latter, in the partial disguise, it must\r\nbe admitted, of a long blue frock-coat, had climbed to the wretched\r\napartment which Marietta Valserra occupied on the fourth floor of an old\r\nhouse behind the theatre? His joy was doubled when he heard that\r\nFabrizio had presented himself under a false name, and had had the\r\nhonour to arouse the jealousy of a scapegrace named Giletti, who in town\r\nplayed Third Servant, and in the villages danced on the tight rope. This\r\nnoble lover of Marietta cursed Fabrizio most volubly and expressed a\r\ndesire to kill him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE PHANTOM HARLEQUIN_\r\n\r\n\r\nOpera companies are formed by an _impresario_ who engages in different\r\nplaces the artists whom he can afford to pay or has found unemployed,\r\nand the company collected at random remains together for one season or\r\ntwo at most. It is not so with _comedy companies_; while passing from\r\ntown to town and changing their address every two or three months, they\r\nnevertheless form a family of which all the members love or loathe one\r\nanother. There are in these companies united couples whom the _beaux_ of\r\nthe towns in which the actors appear find it sometimes exceedingly\r\ndifficult to sunder. This is precisely what happened to our hero. Little\r\nMarietta liked him well enough, but was horribly afraid of Giletti, who\r\nclaimed to be her sole lord and master and kept a close watch over her.\r\nHe protested everywhere that he would kill the _Monsignore_, for he had\r\nfollowed Fabrizio, and had succeeded in discovering his name. This\r\nGiletti was quite the ugliest creature imaginable and the least fitted\r\nto be a lover: tall out of all proportion, he was horribly thin,\r\nstrongly pitted by smallpox, and inclined to squint. In addition, being\r\nendowed with all the graces of his profession, he was continually coming\r\ninto the wings where his fellow-actors were assembled, turning\r\ncartwheels on his feet and hands or practising some other pretty trick.\r\nHe triumphed in those parts in which the actor has to appear with his\r\nface whitened with flour and to give or receive a countless number of\r\nblows with a cudgel. This worthy rival of Fabrizio drew a monthly salary\r\nof 32 francs, and thought himself extremely well off.\r\n\r\nConte Mosca felt himself drawn up from the gate of the tomb when his\r\nwatchers gave him the full authority for all these details. His kindly\r\nnature reappeared; he seemed more gay and better company than ever in\r\nthe Duchessa\'s drawing-room, and took good care to say nothing to her of\r\nthe little adventure which had restored him to life. He even took steps\r\nto ensure that she should be informed of everything that occurred with\r\nthe greatest possible delay. Finally he had the courage to listen to the\r\nvoice of reason, which had been crying to him in vain for the last month\r\nthat, whenever a lover\'s lustre begins to fade, it is time for that\r\nlover to travel.\r\n\r\nUrgent business summoned him to Bologna, and twice a day cabinet\r\nmessengers brought him not so much the official papers of his\r\ndepartments as the latest news of the love affairs of little Marietta,\r\nthe rage of the terrible Giletti and the enterprises of Fabrizio.\r\n\r\nOne of the Conte\'s agents asked several times for _Arlecchino fantasma e\r\npasticcio_, one of Giletti\'s triumphs (he emerges from the pie at the\r\nmoment when his rival Brighella is sticking the knife into it, and gives\r\nhim a drubbing); this was an excuse for making him earn 100 francs.\r\nGiletti, who was riddled with debts, took care not to speak of this\r\nwindfall, but became astonishing in his arrogance.\r\n\r\nFabrizio\'s whim changed to a wounded pride (at his age, his anxieties\r\nhad already reduced him to the state of having whims!). Vanity led him\r\nto the theatre; the little girl acted in the most sprightly fashion and\r\namused him; on leaving the theatre, he was in love for an hour. The\r\nConte returned to Parma on receiving the news that Fabrizio was in real\r\ndanger; Giletti, who had served as a trooper in that fine regiment the\r\nDragoni Napoleone, spoke seriously of killing him, and was making\r\narrangements for a subsequent flight to Romagna. If the reader is very\r\nyoung, he will be scandalised by our admiration for this fine mark of\r\nvirtue. It was, however, no slight act of heroism on the part of Conte\r\nMosca, his return from Bologna; for, after all, frequently in the\r\nmorning he presented a worn appearance, and Fabrizio was always so\r\nfresh, so serene! Who would ever have dreamed of reproaching him with\r\nthe death of Fabrizio, occurring in his absence and from so stupid a\r\ncause? But his was one of those rare spirits which make an everlasting\r\nremorse out of a generous action which they might have done and did not\r\ndo; besides, he could not bear the thought of seeing the Duchessa look\r\nsad, and by any fault of his.\r\n\r\nHe found her, on his arrival, taciturn and gloomy. This is what had\r\noccurred: the little lady\'s maid, Cecchina, tormented by remorse and\r\nestimating the importance of her crime by the immensity of the sum that\r\nshe had received for committing it, had fallen ill. One evening the\r\nDuchessa, who was devoted to her, went up to her room. The girl could\r\nnot hold out against this mark of kindness; she dissolved in tears, was\r\nfor handing over to her mistress all that she still possessed of the\r\nmoney she had received, and finally had the courage to confess to her\r\nthe questions asked by the Conte and her own replies to them. The\r\nDuchessa ran to the lamp which she blew out, then said to little\r\nCecchina that she forgave her, but on condition that she never uttered a\r\nword about this strange episode to anyone in the world. "The poor\r\nConte," she added in a careless tone, "is afraid of being laughed at;\r\nall men are like that."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_REMORSE_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duchessa hastened downstairs to her own apartments. No sooner had\r\nshe shut the door of her bedroom than she burst into tears; there seemed\r\nto her something horrible in the idea of her making love to Fabrizio\r\nwhom she had seen brought into the world; and yet what else could her\r\nbehaviour imply?\r\n\r\nThis had been the primary cause of the black melancholy in which the\r\nConte found her plunged; on his arrival she suffered fits of impatience\r\nwith him, and almost with Fabrizio; she would have liked never to set\r\neyes on either of them again; she was contemptuous of the part,\r\nridiculous in her eyes, which Fabrizio was playing with the little\r\nMarietta; for the Conte had told her everything, like a true lover,\r\nincapable of keeping a secret. She could not grow used to this disaster;\r\nher idol had a fault; finally, in a moment of frank friendship, she\r\nasked the Conte\'s advice; this was for him a delicious instant, and a\r\nfine reward for the honourable impulse which had made him return to\r\nParma.\r\n\r\n"What could be more simple?" said the Conte, smiling. "Young men want to\r\nhave every woman they see, and next day they do not give her a thought.\r\nOught he not to be going to Belgirate, to see the Marchesa del Dongo?\r\nVery well, let him go. During his absence, I shall request the company\r\nof comedians to take their talents elsewhere, I shall pay their\r\ntravelling expenses; but presently we shall see him in love with the\r\nfirst pretty woman that may happen to come his way: it is in the nature\r\nof things, and I should not care to see him act otherwise. . . . If\r\nnecessary, get the Marchesa to write to him."\r\n\r\nThis suggestion, offered with the air of a complete indifference, came\r\nas a ray of light to the Duchessa; she was frightened of Giletti. That\r\nevening, the Conte announced, as though by chance, that one of his\r\ncouriers, on his way to Vienna, would be passing through Milan; three\r\ndays later Fabrizio received a letter from his mother. He seemed greatly\r\nannoyed at not having yet been able, thanks to Giletti\'s jealousy, to\r\nprofit by the excellent intentions, assurance of which little Marietta\r\nhad conveyed to him through a _mammaccia_, an old woman who acted as her\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nFabrizio found his mother and one of his sisters at Belgirate, a large\r\nvillage in Piedmont, on the right shore of Lake Maggiore; the left shore\r\nbelongs to the Milanese, and consequently to Austria. This lake,\r\nparallel to the Lake of Como, and also running from north to south, is\r\nsituated some ten leagues farther to the west. The mountain air, the\r\nmajestic and tranquil aspect of this superb lake which recalled to him\r\nthat other on the shores of which he had spent his childhood, all helped\r\nto transform into a tender melancholy Fabrizio\'s grief, which was akin\r\nto anger. It was with an infinite tenderness that the memory of the\r\nDuchessa now presented itself to him; he felt that in separation he was\r\nacquiring for her that love which he had never felt for any woman;\r\nnothing would have been more painful to him than to be separated from\r\nher for ever, and, he being in this frame of mind, if the Duchessa had\r\ndeigned to have recourse to the slightest coquetry, she could have\r\nconquered this heart by--for instance--presenting it with a rival. But,\r\nfar from taking any so decisive a step, it was not without the keenest\r\nself-reproach that she found her thoughts constantly following in the\r\nyoung traveller\'s footsteps. She reproached herself for what she still\r\ncalled a fancy, as though it had been something horrible; she redoubled\r\nher forethought for and attention to the Conte, who, captivated by such\r\na display of charm, paid no heed to the sane voice of reason which was\r\nprescribing a second visit to Bologna.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_LAKE MAGGIORE_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Marchesa del Dongo, busy with preparations for the wedding of her\r\nelder daughter, whom she was marrying to a Milanese Duca, could give\r\nonly three days to her beloved son; never had she found in him so tender\r\nan affection. Through the cloud of melancholy that was more and more\r\nclosely enwrapping Fabrizio\'s heart, an odd and indeed ridiculous idea\r\nhad presented itself, and he had suddenly decided to adopt it. Dare we\r\nsay that he wished to consult Priore Blan\xc3\xa8s? That excellent old man was\r\ntotally incapable of understanding the sorrows of a heart torn asunder\r\nby boyish passions more or less equal in strength; besides, it would\r\nhave taken a week to make him gather even a faint impression of all the\r\nconflicting interests that Fabrizio had to consider at Parma; but in the\r\nthought of consulting him Fabrizio recaptured the freshness of his\r\nsensations at the age of sixteen. Will it be believed? It was not simply\r\nas to a man full of wisdom, to an old and devoted friend, that Fabrizio\r\nwished to speak to him; the object of this expedition, and the feelings\r\nthat agitated our hero during the fifty hours that it lasted are so\r\nabsurd that doubtless, in the interests of our narrative, it would have\r\nbeen better to suppress them. I am afraid that Fabrizio\'s credulity may\r\nmake him forfeit the sympathy of the reader; but after all thus it was;\r\nwhy flatter him more than another? I have not flattered Conte Mosca, nor\r\nthe Prince.\r\n\r\nFabrizio, then, since the whole truth must be told, Fabrizio escorted\r\nhis mother as far as the port of Laveno, on the left shore of Lake\r\nMaggiore, the Austrian shore, where she landed about eight o\'clock in\r\nthe evening. (The lake is regarded as neutral territory, and no passport\r\nis required of those who do not set foot on shore.) But scarcely had\r\nnight fallen when he had himself ferried to this same Austrian shore,\r\nand landed in a little wood which juts out into the water. He had hired\r\na _sediola_, a sort of rustic and fast-moving tilbury, by means of which\r\nhe was able, at a distance of five hundred yards, to keep up with his\r\nmother\'s carriage; he was disguised as a servant of the _casa_ del Dongo,\r\nand none of the many police or customs officials ever thought of asking\r\nhim for his passport. A quarter of a league before Como, where the\r\nMarchesa and her daughter were to stop for the night, he took a path to\r\nthe left which, making a circuit of the village of Vico, afterwards\r\njoined a little road recently made along the extreme edge of the lake.\r\nIt was midnight, and Fabrizio could count upon not meeting any of the\r\npolice. The trees of the various thickets into which the little road\r\nkept continually diving traced the black outline of their foliage\r\nagainst a sky bright with stars but veiled by a slight mist. Water and\r\nsky were of a profound tranquillity. Fabrizio\'s soul could not resist\r\nthis sublime beauty; he stopped, then sat down on a rock which ran out\r\ninto the lake, forming almost a little promontory. The universal silence\r\nwas disturbed only, at regular intervals, by the faint ripple of the\r\nlake as it lapped on the shore. Fabrizio had an Italian heart; I crave\r\nthe reader\'s pardon for him: this defect, which will render him less\r\nattractive, consisted mainly in this: he had no vanity, save by fits and\r\nstarts, and the mere sight of sublime beauty melted him to a tender mood\r\nand took from his sorrows their hard and bitter edge. Seated on his\r\nisolated rock, having no longer any need to be on his guard against the\r\npolice, protected by the profound night and the vast silence, gentle\r\ntears moistened his eyes, and he found there, with little or no effort,\r\nthe happiest moments that he had tasted for many a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A NIGHT SCENE_\r\n\r\n\r\nHe resolved never to tell the Duchessa any falsehood, and it was because\r\nhe loved her to adoration at that moment that he vowed to himself never\r\nto say to her _that he loved her_; never would he utter in her hearing\r\nthe word love, since the passion which bears that name was a stranger to\r\nhis heart. In the enthusiasm of generosity and virtue which formed his\r\nhappiness at that moment, he made the resolution to tell her, at the\r\nfirst opportunity, everything: his heart had never known love. Once this\r\ncourageous plan had been definitely adopted, he felt himself delivered\r\nof an enormous burden. "She will perhaps have something to say to me\r\nabout Marietta; very well, I shall never see my little Marietta again,"\r\nhe assured himself blithely.\r\n\r\nThe overpowering heat which had prevailed throughout the day was\r\nbeginning to be tempered by the morning breeze. Already dawn was\r\noutlining in a faint white glimmer the Alpine peaks that rise to the\r\nnorth and east of Lake Como. Their massive shapes, bleached by their\r\ncovering of snow, even in the month of June, stand out against the\r\npellucid azure of a sky which at those immense altitudes is always pure.\r\nA spur of the Alps stretching southwards into smiling Italy separates\r\nthe sloping shores of Lake Como from those of the Lake of Garda.\r\nFabrizio followed with his eye all the branches of these sublime\r\nmountains, the dawn as it grew brighter came to mark the valleys that\r\ndivide them, gilding the faint mist which rose from the gorges beneath.\r\n\r\nSome minutes since Fabrizio had taken the road again; he passed the hill\r\nthat forms the peninsula of Durini, and at length there met his gaze\r\nthat _campanile_ of the village of Grianta in which he had so often made\r\nobservations of the stars with Priore Blan\xc3\xa8s. "What bounds were there\r\nto my ignorance in those days? I could not understand," he reminded\r\nhimself, "even the ridiculous Latin of those treatises on astrology\r\nwhich my master used to pore over, and I think I respected them chiefly\r\nbecause, understanding only a few words here and there, my imagination\r\nstepped in to give them a meaning, and the most romantic sense\r\nimaginable."\r\n\r\nGradually his thoughts entered another channel. "May not there be\r\nsomething genuine in this science? Why should it be different from the\r\nrest? A certain number of imbeciles and quick-witted persons agree among\r\nthemselves that they know (shall we say) _Mexican_; they impose\r\nthemselves with this qualification upon society which respects them and\r\ngovernments which pay them. Favours are showered upon them precisely\r\nbecause they have no real intelligence, and authority need not fear\r\ntheir raising the populace and creating an atmosphere of rant by the aid\r\nof generous sentiments! For instance, Father Bari, to whom Ernesto IV\r\nhas just awarded a pension of 4,000 francs and the Cross of his Order\r\nfor having restored nineteen lines of a Greek dithyramb!\r\n\r\n"But, Great God, have I indeed the right to find such things ridiculous?\r\nIs it for me to complain," he asked himself, suddenly, stopping short in\r\nthe road, "has not that same Cross just been given to my governor at\r\nNaples?" Fabrizio was conscious of a feeling of intense disgust; the\r\nfine enthusiasm for virtue which had just been making his heart beat\r\nhigh changed into the vile pleasure of having a good share in the spoils\r\nof a robbery. "After all," he said to himself at length, with the\r\nlustreless eyes of a man who is dissatisfied with himself, "since my\r\nbirth gives me the right to profit by these abuses, it would be a signal\r\npiece of folly on my part not to take my share, but I must never let\r\nmyself denounce them in public." This reasoning was by no means unsound;\r\nbut Fabrizio had fallen a long way from that elevation of sublime\r\nhappiness to which he had found himself transported an hour earlier. The\r\nthought of privilege had withered that plant, always so delicate, which\r\nwe name happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PRIVILEGE_\r\n\r\n\r\n"If we are not to believe in astrology," he went on, seeking to calm\r\nhimself; "if this science is, like three quarters of the sciences that\r\nare not mathematical, a collection of enthusiastic simpletons and adroit\r\nhypocrites paid by the masters they serve, how does it come about that\r\nI think so often and with emotion of this fatal circumstance: I did make\r\nmy escape from the prison at B----, but in the uniform and with the\r\nmarching orders of a soldier who had been flung into prison with good\r\ncause?"\r\n\r\nFabrizio\'s reasoning could never succeed in penetrating farther; he went\r\na hundred ways round the difficulty without managing to surmount it. He\r\nwas too young still; in his moments of leisure, his mind devoted itself\r\nwith rapture to enjoying the sensations produced by the romantic\r\ncircumstances with which his imagination was always ready to supply him.\r\nHe was far from employing his time in studying with patience the actual\r\ndetails of things in order to discover their causes. Reality still\r\nseemed to him flat and muddy; I can understand a person\'s not caring to\r\nlook at it, but then he ought not to argue about it. Above all, he ought\r\nnot to fashion objections out of the scattered fragments of his\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\nThus it was that, though not lacking in brains, Fabrizio could not\r\nmanage to see that his half-belief in omens was for him a religion, a\r\nprofound impression received at his entering upon life. To think of this\r\nbelief was to feel, it was a happiness. And he set himself resolutely to\r\ndiscover how this could be a _proved_, a real science, in the same\r\ncategory as geometry, for example. He searched his memory strenuously\r\nfor all the instances in which omens observed by him had not been\r\nfollowed by the auspicious or inauspicious events which they seemed to\r\nherald. But all this time, while he believed himself to be following a\r\nline of reasoning and marching towards the truth, his attention kept\r\ncoming joyfully to rest on the memory of the occasions on which the\r\nforeboding had been amply followed by the happy or unhappy accident\r\nwhich it had seemed to him to predict, and his heart was filled with\r\nrespect and melted; and he would have felt an invincible repugnance for\r\nthe person who denied the value of omens, especially if in doing so he\r\nhad had recourse to irony.\r\n\r\nFabrizio walked on without noticing the distance he was covering, and\r\nhad reached this point in his vain reasonings when, raising his head, he\r\nsaw the wall of his father\'s garden. This wall, which supported a fine\r\nterrace, rose to a height of more than forty feet above the road, on its\r\nright. A cornice of wrought stone along the highest part, next to the\r\nbalustrade, gave it a monumental air. "It is not bad," Fabrizio said to\r\nhimself dispassionately, "it is good architecture, a little in the Roman\r\nstyle"; he applied to it his recently acquired knowledge of antiquities.\r\nThen he turned his head away in disgust; his father\'s severities, and\r\nespecially the denunciation of himself by his brother Ascanio on his\r\nreturn from his wanderings in France, came back to his mind.\r\n\r\n"That unnatural denunciation was the origin of my present existence; I\r\nmay detest, I may despise it; when all is said and done, it has altered\r\nmy destiny. What would have become of me once I had been packed off to\r\nNovara, and my presence barely tolerated in the house of my father\'s\r\nagent, if my aunt had not made love to a powerful Minister? If the said\r\naunt had happened to possess merely a dry, conventional heart instead of\r\nthat tender and passionate heart which loves me with a sort of\r\nenthusiasm that astonishes me? Where should I be now if the Duchessa had\r\nhad the heart of her brother the Marchese del Dongo?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PRIORE BLAN\xc3\x88S_\r\n\r\n\r\nOppressed by these cruel memories, Fabrizio began now to walk with an\r\nuncertain step; he came to the edge of the moat immediately opposite the\r\nmagnificent fa\xc3\xa7ade of the castle. Scarcely did he cast a glance at that\r\ngreat building, blackened by time. The noble language of architecture\r\nleft him unmoved, the memory of his brother and father stopped his heart\r\nto every sensation of beauty, he was attentive only to the necessity of\r\nkeeping on his guard in the presence of hypocritical and dangerous\r\nenemies. He looked for an instant, but with a marked disgust, at the\r\nlittle window of the bedroom which he had occupied until 1815 on the\r\nthird storey. His father\'s character had robbed of all charm the memory\r\nof his early childhood. "I have not set foot in it," he thought, "since\r\nthe 7th of March, at eight o\'clock in the evening. I left it to go and\r\nget the passport from Vasi, and next morning my fear of spies made me\r\nhasten my departure. When I passed through again after my visit to\r\nFrance, I had not time to go upstairs, even to look at my prints again,\r\nand that thanks to my brother\'s denouncing me."\r\n\r\nFabrizio turned away his head in horror. "Priore Blan\xc3\xa8s is eighty-three\r\nat the very least," he said sorrowfully to himself; "he hardly ever\r\ncomes to the castle now, from what my sister tells me; the infirmities\r\nof old age have had their effect on him. That heart, once so strong and\r\nnoble, is frozen by age. Heaven knows how long it is since he last went\r\nup to his _campanile_! I shall hide myself in the cellar, under the vats\r\nor under the wine-press, until he is awake; I shall not go in and\r\ndisturb the good old man in his sleep; probably he will have forgotten\r\nmy face, even; six years mean a great deal at his age! I shall find only\r\nthe tomb of a friend! And it is really childish of me," he added, "to\r\nhave come here to provoke the disgust that the sight of my father\'s\r\ncastle gives me."\r\n\r\nFabrizio now came to the little _piazza_ in front of the church; it was\r\nwith an astonishment bordering on delirium that he saw, on the second\r\nstage of the ancient _campanile_, the long and narrow window lighted by\r\nthe little lantern of Priore Blan\xc3\xa8s. The Priore was in the habit of\r\nleaving it there, when he climbed to the cage of planks which formed his\r\nobservatory, so that the light should not prevent him from reading the\r\nface of his planisphere. This chart of the heavens was stretched over a\r\ngreat jar of terra-cotta which had originally belonged to one of the\r\norange trees at the castle. In the opening, at the bottom of the jar,\r\nburned the tiniest of lamps, the smoke of which was carried away from\r\nthe jar through a little tin pipe, and the shadow of the pipe indicated\r\nthe north on the chart. All these memories of things so simple in\r\nthemselves deluged Fabrizio\'s heart with emotions and filled him with\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nAlmost without thinking, he put his hands to his lips and gave the\r\nlittle, short, low whistle which had formerly been the signal for his\r\nadmission. At once he heard several tugs given to the cord which, from\r\nthe observatory above, opened the latch of the _campanile_ door. He dashed\r\nheadlong up the staircase, moved to a transport of excitement; he found\r\nthe Priore in his wooden armchair in his accustomed place; his eye was\r\nfixed on the little glass of a mural quadrant. With his left hand the\r\nPriore made a sign to Fabrizio not to interrupt him in his observation;\r\na moment later, he wrote down a figure upon a playing card, then,\r\nturning round in his chair, opened his arms to our hero who flung\r\nhimself into them, dissolved in tears. Priore Blan\xc3\xa8s was his true\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n"I expected you," said Blan\xc3\xa8s, after the first warm words of affection.\r\nWas the Priore speaking in his character as a diviner, or, indeed, as he\r\noften thought of Fabrizio, had some astrological sign, by pure chance,\r\nannounced to him the young man\'s return?\r\n\r\n"This means that my death is at hand," said Priore Blan\xc3\xa8s.\r\n\r\n"What!" cried Fabrizio, quite overcome.\r\n\r\n"Yes," the Priore went on in a serious but by no means sad tone: "five\r\nmonths and a half, or six months and a half after I have seen you again,\r\nmy life having found its full complement of happiness will be\r\nextinguished\r\n\r\n\r\n     Come face al mancar dell\'alimento"\r\n\r\n\r\n(as the little lamp is when its oil runs dry). "Before the supreme\r\nmoment, I shall probably pass a month or two without speaking, after\r\nwhich I shall be received into Our Father\'s Bosom; provided always that\r\nHe finds that I have performed my duty in the post in which He has\r\nplaced me as a sentinel.\r\n\r\n"But you, you are worn out with exhaustion, your emotion makes you ready\r\nfor sleep. Since I began to expect you, I have hidden a loaf of bread\r\nand a bottle of brandy for you in the great chest which holds my\r\ninstruments. Give yourself that sustenance, and try to collect enough\r\nstrength to listen to me for a few moments longer. It lies in my power\r\nto tell you a number of things before night shall have given place\r\naltogether to-day; at present I see them a great deal more distinctly\r\nthan perhaps I shall see them to-morrow. For, my child, we are at all\r\ntimes frail vessels, and we must always take that frailty into account.\r\nTo-morrow, it may be, the old man, the earthly man in me will be\r\noccupied with preparations for my death, and to-morrow evening at nine\r\no\'clock, you will have to leave me."\r\n\r\nFabrizio having obeyed him in silence, as was his custom:\r\n\r\n"Then, it is true," the old man went on, "that when you tried to see\r\nWaterloo you found nothing at first but a prison?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Father," replied Fabrizio in amazement.\r\n\r\n"Well, that was a rare piece of good fortune, for, warned by my voice,\r\nyour soul can prepare itself for another prison, far different in its\r\nausterity, far more terrible! Probably you will escape from it only by a\r\ncrime; but, thanks be to heaven, that crime will not have been committed\r\nby you. Never fall into crime, however violently you may be tempted; I\r\nseem to see that it will be a question of killing an innocent man, who,\r\nwithout knowing it, usurps your rights; if you resist the violent\r\ntemptation which will seem to be justified by the laws of honour, your\r\nlife will be most happy in the eyes of men . . . and reasonably happy in\r\nthe eyes of the sage," he added after a moment\'s reflexion; "you will\r\ndie like me, my son, sitting upon a wooden seat, far from all luxury and\r\nhaving seen the hollowness of luxury, and like me not having to reproach\r\nyourself with any grave sin.\r\n\r\n"And now, the discussion of your future state is at an end between us, I\r\ncould add nothing of any importance. It is in vain that I have tried to\r\nsee how long this imprisonment is to last; is it to be for six months, a\r\nyear, ten years? I have been able to discover nothing; apparently I have\r\nmade some error, and heaven has wished to punish me by the distress of\r\nthis uncertainty. I have seen only that after your prison, but I do not\r\nknow whether it is to be at the actual moment of your leaving it, there\r\nwill be what I call a crime; but, fortunately, I believe I can be sure\r\nthat it will not be committed by you. If you are weak enough to involve\r\nyourself in this crime, all the rest of my calculations becomes simply\r\none long error. Then you will not die with peace in your soul, on a\r\nwooden seat and clad in white." As he said these words, Priore Blan\xc3\xa8s\r\nattempted to rise; it was then that Fabrizio noticed the ravages of\r\ntime; it took him nearly a minute to get upon his feet and to turn\r\ntowards Fabrizio. Our hero allowed him to do this, standing motionless\r\nand silent. The Priore flung himself into his arms again and again; he\r\nembraced him with extreme affection. After which he went on, with all\r\nthe gaiety of the old days: "Try to make a place for yourself among all\r\nmy instruments where you can sleep with some comfort; take my furs; you\r\nwill find several of great value which the Duchessa Sanseverina sent me\r\nfour years ago. She asked me for a forecast of your fate, which I took\r\ncare not to give her, while keeping her furs and her fine quadrant.\r\nEvery announcement of the future is a breach of the rule, and contains\r\nthis danger, that it may alter the event, in which case the whole\r\nscience falls to the ground, like a child\'s card-castle; and besides,\r\nthere were things that it was hard to say to that Duchessa who is always\r\nso charming. But let me warn you, do not be startled in your sleep by\r\nthe bells, which will make a terrible din in your ear when the men come\r\nto ring for the seven o\'clock mass; later on, in the stage below, they\r\nwill set the big _campanone_ going, which shakes all my instruments.\r\nTo-day is the feast of San Giovita, Martyr and Soldier. As you know, the\r\nlittle village of Grianta has the same patron as the great city of\r\nBrescia, which, by the way, led to a most amusing mistake on the part of\r\nmy illustrious master, Giacomo Marini of Ravenna. More than once he\r\nannounced to me that I should have quite a fine career in the church; he\r\nbelieved that I was to be the curate of the magnificent church of San\r\nGiovita, at Brescia; I have been the curate of a little village of seven\r\nhundred and fifty chimneys! But all has been for the best. I have seen,\r\nand not ten years ago, that if I had been curate at Brescia, my destiny\r\nwould have been to be cast into prison on a hill in Moravia, the\r\nSpielberg. To-morrow I shall bring you all manner of delicacies pilfered\r\nfrom the great dinner which I am giving to all the clergy of the\r\ndistrict who are coming to sing at my high mass. I shall leave them down\r\nbelow, but do not make any attempt to see me, do not come down to take\r\npossession of the good things until you have heard me go out again. You\r\nmust not see me again _by daylight_, and as the sun sets to-morrow at\r\ntwenty-seven minutes past seven, I shall not come up to embrace you\r\nuntil about eight, and it is necessary that you depart while the hours\r\nare still numbered by nine, that is to say before the clock has struck\r\nten. Take care that you are not seen in the windows of the _campanile_:\r\nthe police have your description, and they are to some extent under the\r\norders of your brother, who is a famous tyrant. The Marchese del Dongo\r\nis growing feeble," added Blan\xc3\xa8s with a sorrowful air, "and if he were\r\nto see you again, perhaps he would let something pass to you, from hand\r\nto hand. But such benefits, tainted with deceit, do not become a man\r\nlike yourself, whose strength will lie one day in his conscience. The\r\nMarchese abhors his son Ascanio, and it is on that son that the five or\r\nsix millions that he possesses will devolve. That is justice. You, at\r\nhis death, will have a pension of 4,000 francs, and fifty ells of black\r\ncloth for your servants\' mourning."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE\r\n\r\n\r\nFabrizio\'s soul was exalted by the old man\'s speech, by his own keen\r\nattention to it, and by his extreme exhaustion. He had great difficulty\r\nin getting to sleep, and his slumber was disturbed by dreams, presages\r\nperhaps of the future; in the morning, at ten o\'clock, he was awakened\r\nby the whole belfry\'s beginning to shake; an alarming noise seemed to\r\ncome from outside. He rose in bewilderment and at first imagined that\r\nthe end of the world had come; then he thought that he was in prison; it\r\ntook him some time to recognise the sound of the big bell, which forty\r\npeasants were setting in motion in honour of the great San Giovita; ten\r\nwould have been enough.\r\n\r\nFabrizio looked for a convenient place from which to see without being\r\nseen; he discovered that from this great height his gaze swept the\r\ngardens, and even the inner courtyard of his father\'s castle. He had\r\nforgotten this. The idea of that father arriving at the ultimate bourne\r\nof life altered all his feelings. He could even make out the sparrows\r\nthat were hopping in search of crumbs upon the wide balcony of the\r\ndining-room. "They are the descendants of the ones I used to tame long\r\nago," he said to himself. This balcony, like every balcony in the\r\nmansion, was decorated with a large number of orange trees in\r\nearthenware tubs, of different sizes: this sight melted his heart; the\r\nview of that inner courtyard thus decorated, with its sharply defined\r\nshadows outlined by a radiant sun, was truly majestic.\r\n\r\nThe thought of his father\'s failing health came back to his mind. "But\r\nit is really singular," he said to himself, "my father is only\r\nthirty-five years older than I am; thirty-five and twenty-three make\r\nonly fifty-eight!" His eyes, fixed on the windows of the bedroom of that\r\nstern man who had never loved him, filled with tears. He shivered, and a\r\nsudden chill ran through his veins when he thought he saw his father\r\ncrossing a terrace planted with orange trees which was on a level with\r\nhis room; but it was only one of the servants. Close underneath the\r\n_campanile_ a number of girls dressed in white and split up into\r\ndifferent bands were occupied in tracing patterns with red, blue and\r\nyellow flowers on the pavement of the streets through which the\r\nprocession was to pass. But there was a spectacle which spoke with a\r\nmore living voice to Fabrizio\'s soul: from the _campanile_ his gaze shot\r\ndown to the two branches of the lake, at a distance of several leagues,\r\nand this sublime view soon made him forget all the others; it awakened\r\nin him the most lofty sentiments. All the memories of his childhood came\r\ncrowding to besiege his mind; and this day which he spent imprisoned in\r\na belfry was perhaps one of the happiest days of his life.\r\n\r\nHappiness carried him to an exaltation of mind quite foreign to his\r\nnature; he considered the incidents of life, he, still so young, as if\r\nalready he had arrived at its farthest goal. "I must admit that, since I\r\ncame to Parma," he said to himself at length after several hours of\r\ndelicious musings, "I have known no tranquil and perfect joy such as I\r\nused to find at Naples in galloping over the roads of Vomero or pacing\r\nthe shores of Miseno. All the complicated interests of that nasty little\r\ncourt have made me nasty also. . . . I even believe that it would be a\r\nsorry happiness for me to humiliate my enemies if I had any; but I have\r\nno enemy. . . . Stop a moment!" he suddenly interjected, "I have got an\r\nenemy, Giletti. . . . And here is a curious thing," he said to himself,\r\n"the pleasure that I should feel in seeing such an ugly fellow go to all\r\nthe devils in hell has survived the very slight fancy that I had for\r\nlittle Marietta. . . . She does not come within a mile of the Duchessa\r\nd\'A----, to whom I was obliged to make love at Naples, after I had told\r\nher that I was in love with her. Good God, how bored I have been during\r\nthe long assignations which that fair Duchessa used to accord me; never\r\nanything like that in the tumble-down bedroom, serving as a kitchen as\r\nwell, in which little Marietta received me twice, and for two minutes on\r\neach occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE CAMPANILE_\r\n\r\n\r\n"Oh, good God, what on earth can those people have to eat? They make one\r\npity them! . . . I ought to have settled on her and the _mammaccia_ a\r\npension of three beefsteaks, payable daily. . . . Little Marietta," he\r\nwent on, "used to distract me from the evil thoughts which the proximity\r\nof that court put in my mind.\r\n\r\n"I should perhaps have done well to adopt the _caff\xc3\xa8_ life, as the\r\nDuchessa said; she seemed to incline in that direction, and she has far\r\nmore intelligence than I. Thanks to her generosity, or indeed merely\r\nwith that pension of 4,000 francs and that fund of 40,000 invested at\r\nLyons, which my mother intends for me, I should always have a horse and\r\na few scudi to spend on digging and collecting a cabinet. Since it\r\nappears that I am not to know the taste of love, there will always be\r\nthose other interests to be my great sources of happiness; I should\r\nlike, before I die, to go back to visit the battlefield of Waterloo and\r\ntry to identify the meadow where I was so neatly lifted from my horse\r\nand left sitting on the ground. That pilgrimage accomplished, I should\r\nreturn constantly to this sublime lake; nothing else as beautiful is to\r\nbe seen in the world, for my heart at least. Why go so far afield in\r\nsearch of happiness? It is there, beneath my eyes!\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Fabrizio to himself, "there is this objection: the police\r\ndrive me away from the Lake of Como, but I am younger than the people\r\nwho are setting those police on my track. Here," he added with a smile,\r\n"I should certainly not find a Duchessa d\'A----, but I should find one\r\nof those little girls down there who are strewing flowers on the\r\npavement, and, to tell the truth, I should care for her just as much.\r\nHypocrisy freezes me, even in love, and our great ladies aim at effects\r\nthat are too sublime. Napoleon has given them new ideas as to conduct\r\nand constancy.\r\n\r\n"The devil!" he suddenly exclaimed, drawing back his head from the\r\nwindow, as though he had been afraid of being recognised despite the\r\nscreen of the enormous wooden shutter which protected the bells from\r\nrain, "here comes a troop of police in full dress." And indeed, ten\r\npolicemen, of whom four were non-commissioned officers, had come into\r\nsight at the top of the village street. The serjeant distributed them at\r\nintervals of a hundred yards along the course which the procession was\r\nto take. "Everyone knows me here; if they see me, I shall make but one\r\nbound from the shores of the Lake of Como to the Spielberg, where they\r\nwill fasten to each of my legs a chain weighing a hundred and ten\r\npounds: and what a grief for the Duchessa!"\r\n\r\nIt took Fabrizio two or three minutes to realise that, for one thing, he\r\nwas stationed at a height of more than eighty feet, that the place in\r\nwhich he stood was comparatively dark, that the eyes of the people who\r\nmight be looking up at him were blinded by a dazzling sun, in addition\r\nto which they were walking about, their eyes wide open, in streets all\r\nthe houses of which had just been whitewashed with lime, in honour of\r\nthe _festa_ of San Giovita. Despite all these clear and obvious reasons,\r\nFabrizio\'s Italian nature would not have been in a state, from that\r\nmoment, to enjoy any pleasure in the spectacle, had he not interposed\r\nbetween himself and the policemen a strip of old cloth which he nailed\r\nto the frame of the window, piercing a couple of holes in it for his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nThe bells had been making the air throb for ten minutes, the procession\r\nwas coming out of the church, the _mortaretti_ started to bang. Fabrizio\r\nturned his head and recognised that little terrace, adorned with a\r\nparapet and overlooking the lake, where so often, when he was a boy, he\r\nhad risked his life to watch the _mortaretti_ go off between his legs,\r\nwith the result that on the mornings of public holidays his mother liked\r\nto see him by her side.\r\n\r\nIt should be explained that the _mortaretti_ (or little mortars) are\r\nnothing else than gun-barrels which are sawn through so as to leave them\r\nonly four inches long; that is why the peasants greedily collect all the\r\ngun-barrels which, since 1796, European policy has been sowing broadcast\r\nover the plains of Lombardy. Once they have been reduced to a length of\r\nfour inches, these little guns are loaded to the muzzle, they are\r\nplanted in the ground in a vertical position, and a train of powder is\r\nlaid from one to the next; they are drawn up in three lines like a\r\nbattalion, and to the number of two or three hundred, in some suitable\r\nemplacement near the route along which the procession is to pass. When\r\nthe Blessed Sacrament approaches, a match is put to the train of powder,\r\nand then begins a running fire of sharp explosions, utterly irregular\r\nand quite ridiculous; the women are wild with joy. Nothing is so gay as\r\nthe sound of these _mortaretti_, heard at a distance on the lake, and\r\nsoftened by the rocking of the water; this curious sound, which had so\r\noften been the delight of his boyhood, banished the somewhat too solemn\r\nthoughts by which our hero was being besieged; he went to find the\r\nPriore\'s big astronomical telescope, and recognised the majority of the\r\nmen and women who were following the procession. A number of charming\r\nlittle girls, whom Fabrizio had last seen at the age of eleven or\r\ntwelve, were now superb women in the full flower of the most vigorous\r\nyouth; they made our hero\'s courage revive, and to speak to them he\r\nwould readily have braved the police.\r\n\r\nAfter the procession had passed and had re-entered the church by a side\r\ndoor which was out of Fabrizio\'s sight, the heat soon became intense\r\neven up in the belfry; the inhabitants returned to their homes, and a\r\ngreat silence fell upon the village. Several boats took on board loads\r\nof _contadini_ returning to Bellagio, Menaggio and other villages\r\nsituated on the lake; Fabrizio could distinguish the sound of each\r\nstroke of the oars: so simple a detail as this sent him into an ecstasy;\r\nhis present joy was composed of all the unhappiness, all the irritation\r\nthat he found in the complicated life of a court. How happy he would\r\nhave been at this moment to be sailing for a league over that beautiful\r\nlake which looked so calm and reflected so clearly the depth of the sky\r\nabove! He heard the door at the foot of the _campanile_ opened: it was\r\nthe Priore\'s old servant who brought in a great hamper, and he had all\r\nthe difficulty in the world in restraining himself from speaking to her.\r\n"She is almost as fond of me as her master," he said to himself, "and\r\nbesides, I am leaving to-night at nine o\'clock; would she not keep the\r\noath of secrecy I should make her swear, if only for a few hours? But,"\r\nFabrizio reminded himself, "I should be vexing my friend! I might get\r\nhim into trouble with the police!" and he let Ghita go without speaking\r\nto her. He made an excellent dinner, then settled himself down to sleep\r\nfor a few minutes; he did not awake until half-past eight in the\r\nevening; the Priore Blan\xc3\xa8s was shaking him by the arm, it was dark.\r\n\r\nBlan\xc3\xa8s was extremely tired, and looked fifty years older than the night\r\nbefore. He said nothing more about serious matters, sitting in his\r\nwooden armchair. "Embrace me," he said to Fabrizio. He clasped him again\r\nand again in his arms. "Death," he said at last, "which is coming to put\r\nan end to this long life, will have nothing about it so painful as this\r\nseparation. I have a purse which I shall leave in Ghita\'s custody, with\r\norders to draw on it for her own needs, but to hand over to you what is\r\nleft, should you ever come to ask for it. I know her; after those\r\ninstructions, she is capable, from economy on your behalf, of not buying\r\nmeat four times in the year, if you do not give her quite definite\r\norders. You may yourself be reduced to penury, and the obol of your aged\r\nfriend will be of service to you. Expect nothing from your brother but\r\natrocious behaviour, and try to earn money by some work which will make\r\nyou useful to society. I foresee strange storms; perhaps, in fifty years\'\r\ntime, the world will have no more room for idlers! Your mother and\r\naunt may fail you, your sisters will have to obey their husbands. . . .\r\nAway with you, away with you, fly!" exclaimed Blan\xc3\xa8s urgently; he\r\nhad just heard a little sound in the clock which warned him that ten was\r\nabout to strike, and he would not even allow Fabrizio to give him a\r\nfarewell embrace.\r\n\r\n"Hurry, hurry!" he cried to him; "it will take you at least a minute to\r\nget down the stair; take care not to fall, that would be a terrible\r\nomen." Fabrizio dashed down the staircase and emerging on to the\r\n_piazza_ began to run. He had scarcely arrived opposite his father\'s\r\ncastle when the bell sounded ten times; each stroke reverberated in his\r\nbosom, where it left a singular sense of disturbance. He stopped to\r\nthink, or rather to give himself up to the passionate feelings inspired\r\nin him by the contemplation of that majestic edifice which he had judged\r\nso coldly the night before. He was recalled from his musings by the\r\nsound of footsteps; he looked up and found himself surrounded by four\r\nconstables. He had a brace of excellent pistols, the priming of which he\r\nhad renewed while he dined; the slight sound that he made in cocking\r\nthem attracted the attention of one of the constables, and he was within\r\nan inch of being arrested. He saw the danger he ran, and decided to fire\r\nthe first shot; he would be justified in doing so, for this was the sole\r\nmethod open to him of resisting four well armed men. Fortunately, the\r\nconstables, who were going round to clear the _osterie_, had not shown\r\nthemselves altogether irresponsive to the hospitality that they had\r\nreceived in several of those sociable resorts; they did not make up\r\ntheir minds quickly enough to do their duty. Fabrizio took to his heels\r\nand ran. The constables went a few yards, running also, and shouting\r\n"Stop! Stop!" then everything relapsed into silence. After every three\r\nhundred yards Fabrizio halted to recover his breath. "The sound of my\r\npistols nearly made me get caught; this is just the sort of thing that\r\nwould make the Duchessa tell me, should it ever be granted me to see her\r\nlovely eyes again, that my mind finds pleasure in contemplating what is\r\ngoing to happen in ten years\' time, and forgets to look-out for what is\r\nactually happening beneath my nose."\r\n\r\nFabrizio shuddered at the thought of the danger he had just escaped; he\r\nincreased his pace, and presently found himself impelled to run, which\r\nwas not over-prudent, as it attracted the attention of several\r\n_contadini_ who were going back to their homes. He could not bring\r\nhimself to stop until he had reached the mountain, more than a league\r\nfrom Grianta, and even when he had stopped, he broke into a cold sweat\r\nat the thought of the Spielberg.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a fine fright!" he said aloud: on hearing the sound of this\r\nword, he was almost tempted to feel ashamed. "But does not my aunt tell\r\nme that the thing I most need is to learn to make allowances for myself?\r\nI am always comparing myself with a model of perfection, which cannot\r\nexist. Very well, I forgive myself my fright, for, from another point of\r\nview, I was quite prepared to defend my liberty, and certainly all four\r\nof them would not have remained on their feet to carry me off to prison.\r\nWhat I am doing at this moment," he went on, "is not military; instead\r\nof retiring rapidly, after having attained my object, and perhaps given\r\nthe alarm to my enemies, I am amusing myself with a fancy more\r\nridiculous perhaps than all the good Priore\'s predictions."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE CHESTNUT TREE_\r\n\r\n\r\nFor indeed, instead of retiring along the shortest line, and gaining the\r\nshore of Lake Maggiore, where his boat was awaiting him, he made an\r\nenormous circuit to go and visit _his tree_. The reader may perhaps\r\nremember the love that Fabrizio bore for a chestnut tree planted by his\r\nmother twenty-three years earlier. "It would be quite worthy of my\r\nbrother," he said to himself, "to have had the tree cut down; but those\r\ncreatures are incapable of delicate shades of feeling; he will never\r\nhave thought of it. And besides, that would not be a bad augury," he\r\nadded with firmness. Two hours later he was shocked by what he saw;\r\nmischief-makers or a storm had broken one of the main branches of the\r\nyoung tree, which hung down withered; Fabrizio cut it off reverently,\r\nusing his dagger, and smoothed the cut carefully, so that the rain\r\nshould not get inside the trunk. Then, although time was highly precious\r\nto him, for day was about to break, he spent a good hour in turning the\r\nsoil round his dear tree. All these acts of folly accomplished, he went\r\nrapidly on his way towards Lake Maggiore. All things considered, he was\r\nnot at all sad; the tree was coming on well, was more vigorous than\r\never, and in five years had almost doubled in height. The branch was\r\nonly an accident of no consequence; once it had been cut off, it did no\r\nmore harm to the tree, which indeed would grow all the better if its\r\nspread began higher from the ground.\r\n\r\nFabrizio had not gone a league when a dazzling band of white indicated\r\nto the east the peaks of the Resegon di Lee, a mountain famous\r\nthroughout the district. The road which he was following became thronged\r\nwith _contadini_; but, instead of adopting military tactics, Fabrizio\r\nlet himself be melted by the sublime or touching aspect of these forests\r\nin the neighbourhood of Lake Como. They are perhaps the finest in the\r\nworld; I do not mean to say those that bring in most new money, as the\r\nSwiss would say, but those that speak most eloquently to the soul. To\r\nlisten to this language in the position in which Fabrizio found himself,\r\nan object for the attentions of the gentlemen of the Lombardo-Venetian\r\npolice, was really childish. "I am half a league from the frontier," he\r\nreminded himself at length, "I am going to meet _doganieri_ and\r\nconstables making their morning rounds: this coat of fine cloth will\r\nlook suspicious, they will ask me for my passport; now that passport is\r\ninscribed at full length with my name, which is marked down for prison;\r\nso here I am under the regrettable necessity of committing a murder. If,\r\nas is usual, the police are going about in pairs, I cannot wait quietly\r\nto fire until one of them tries to take me by the collar; he has only to\r\nclutch me for a moment while he falls, and off I go to the Spielberg."\r\nFabrizio, horrified most of all by the necessity of firing first,\r\npossibly on an old soldier who had served under his uncle, Conte\r\nPietranera, ran to hide himself in the hollow trunk of an enormous\r\nchestnut; he was renewing the priming of his pistols, when he heard a\r\nman coming towards him through the wood, singing very well a delicious\r\nair from _Mercadante_, which was popular at that time in Lombardy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE FOREST_\r\n\r\n\r\n"There is a good omen for me," he said to himself. This air, to which he\r\nlistened religiously, took from him the little spark of anger which was\r\nfinding its way into his reasonings. He scrutinised the high road\r\ncarefully, in both directions, and saw no one: "The singer must be\r\ncoming along some side road," he said to himself. Almost at that moment,\r\nhe saw a footman, very neatly dressed in the English style and mounted\r\non a hack, who was coming towards him at a walk, leading a fine\r\nthoroughbred, which however was perhaps a little too thin.\r\n\r\n"Ah! If I reasoned like Conte Mosca," thought Fabrizio, "when he assures\r\nme that the risks a man runs are always the measure of his rights over\r\nhis neighbours, I should blow out this servant\'s brains with a\r\npistol-shot, and, once I was mounted on the thin horse, I should laugh\r\naloud at all the police in the world. As soon as I was safely in Parma,\r\nI should send money to the man, or to his widow . . . but it would be a\r\nhorrible thing to do!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN\r\n\r\n\r\nMoralising thus, Fabrizio sprang down on to the high road which runs\r\nfrom Lombardy into Switzerland: at this point, it is fully four or five\r\nfeet below the level of the forest. "If my man takes fright," he said to\r\nhimself, "he will go off at a gallop, and I shall be stranded here\r\nlooking the picture of a fool." At this moment he found himself only ten\r\nyards from the footman, who had stopped singing: Fabrizio could see in\r\nhis eyes that he was frightened, he was perhaps going to turn his\r\nhorses. Still without having come to any decision, Fabrizio made a\r\nbound, and seized the thin horse by the bridle.\r\n\r\n"My friend," he said to the footman, "I am not an ordinary thief, for I\r\nam going to begin by giving you twenty francs, but I am obliged to\r\nborrow your horse; I shall be killed if I don\'t get away pretty quickly.\r\nI have the four Riva brothers on my heels, those great hunters whom you\r\nprobably know; they caught me just now in their sister\'s bedroom, I\r\njumped out of the window, and here I am. They dashed out into the forest\r\nwith their dogs and guns. I hid myself in that big hollow chestnut\r\nbecause I saw one of them cross the road; their dogs will track me down.\r\nI am going to mount your horse and gallop a league beyond Como; I am\r\ngoing to Milan to throw myself at the Viceroy\'s feet. I shall leave your\r\nhorse at the post-house with two napoleons for yourself, if you consent\r\nwith good grace. If you offer the slightest resistance, I shall kill you\r\nwith these pistols you see here. If, after I have gone, you set the\r\npolice on my track, my cousin, the gallant Conte Alari, Equerry to the\r\nEmperor, will take good care to break your bones for you."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE HORSE_\r\n\r\n\r\nFabrizio invented the substance of this speech as he went on, uttering\r\nit in a wholly pacific tone.\r\n\r\n"As far as that goes," he went on with a laugh, "my name is no secret; I\r\nam the Marchesino Ascanio del Dongo, my castle is quite close to here,\r\nat Grianta. Damn you!" he cried, raising his voice, "will you let go the\r\nhorse!" The servant, stupefied, never breathed a word. Fabrizio\r\ntransferred the pistol to his left hand, seized the bridle which the\r\nother dropped, sprang into the saddle, and made off at a canter. When he\r\nhad gone three hundred yards, it occurred to him that he had forgotten\r\nto give the man the twenty francs he had promised him; he stopped; there\r\nwas still no one upon the road but the footman, who was following him at\r\na gallop; he signalled to him with his handkerchief to come on, and when\r\nhe judged him to be fifty yards off, flung a handful of small change on\r\nto the road and went on again. From a distance he looked and saw the\r\nfootman gathering up the money. "There is a truly reasonable man,"\r\nFabrizio said to himself with a laugh, "not an unnecessary word." He\r\nproceeded rapidly southwards, halted, towards midday, at a lonely house,\r\nand took the road again a few hours later. At two o\'clock in the morning\r\nhe was on the shore of Lake Maggiore; he soon caught sight of his boat\r\nwhich was tacking to and fro; at the agreed signal, it made for the\r\nshore. He could see no _contadino_ to whom to hand over the horse, so he\r\ngave the noble animal its liberty, and three hours later was at\r\nBelgirate. There, finding himself on friendly soil, he took a little\r\nrest; he was exceedingly joyful, everything had proved a complete\r\nsuccess. Dare we indicate the true causes of his joy? His tree showed a\r\nsuperb growth, and his soul had been refreshed by the deep affection\r\nwhich he had found in the arms of Priore Blan\xc3\xa8s. "Does he really\r\nbelieve," he asked himself, "in all the predictions he has made me? Or\r\nwas he, since my brother has given me the reputation of a Jacobin, a man\r\nwithout law or honour, sticking at nothing, was he seeking simply to\r\nbind me not to yield to the temptation to break the head of some animal\r\nwho may have done me a bad turn?" Two days later, Fabrizio was at Parma,\r\nwhere he greatly amused the Duchessa and the Conte, when he related to\r\nthem, with the utmost exactitude, which he always observed, the whole\r\nstory of his travels.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival, Fabrizio found the porter and all the servants of the\r\n_palazzo_ Sanseverina wearing the tokens of the deepest mourning.\r\n\r\n"Whom have we lost?" he inquired of the Duchessa.\r\n\r\n"That excellent man whom people called my husband has just died at\r\nBaden. He has left me this _palazzo_, that had been arranged beforehand,\r\nbut as a sign of good-fellowship he has added a legacy of 300,000\r\nfrancs, which embarrasses me greatly; I have no desire to surrender it\r\nto his niece, the Marchesa Raversi, who plays the most damnable tricks\r\non me every day. You are interested in art, you must find me some good\r\nsculptor; I shall erect a tomb to the Duca which will cost 300,000\r\nfrancs." The Conte began telling anecdotes about the Raversi.\r\n\r\n"I have tried to win her by kindness, but all in vain," said the\r\nDuchessa. "As for the Duca\'s nephews, I have made them all colonels or\r\ngenerals. In return for which, not a month passes without their sending\r\nme some abominable anonymous letter; I have been obliged to engage a\r\nsecretary simply to read letters of that sort."\r\n\r\n"And these anonymous letters are their mildest offence," the Conte\r\njoined in; "they make a regular business of inventing infamous\r\naccusations. A score of times I could have brought the whole gang before\r\nthe courts, and Your Excellency may imagine," he went on, addressing\r\nFabrizio, "whether my good judges would have convicted them."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_HONEST JUDGES_\r\n\r\n\r\n"Ah, well, that is what spoils it all for me," replied Fabrizio with a\r\nsimplicity which was quite refreshing at court; "I should prefer to see\r\nthem sentenced by magistrates judging according to their conscience."\r\n\r\n"You would oblige me greatly, since you are travelling with a view to\r\ngaining instruction, if you would give me the addresses of such\r\nmagistrates; I shall write to them before I go to bed."\r\n\r\n"If I were Minister, this absence of judges who were honest men would\r\nwound my self-respect."\r\n\r\n"But it seems to me," said the Conte, "that Your Excellency, who is so\r\nfond of the French, and did indeed once lend them the aid of his\r\ninvincible arm, is forgetting for the moment one of their great maxims:\r\n\'It is better to kill the devil than to let the devil kill you.\' I\r\nshould like to see how you would govern these burning souls, who read\r\nevery day the _History of the Revolution in France_, with judges who\r\nwould acquit the people whom I accuse. They would reach the point of not\r\nconvicting the most obviously guilty scoundrels, and would fancy\r\nthemselves Brutuses. But I should like to pick a crow with you; does not\r\nyour delicate soul feel a touch of remorse at the thought of that fine\r\n(though perhaps a little too thin) horse which you have just abandoned\r\non the shore of Lake Maggiore?"\r\n\r\n"I fully intend," said Fabrizio, with the utmost seriousness, "to send\r\nwhatever is necessary to the owner of the horse to recompense him for\r\nthe cost of advertising and any other expenses which he may be made to\r\nincur by the _contadini_ who may have found it; I shall study the Milan\r\nnewspaper most carefully to find the announcement of a missing horse; I\r\nknow the description of that one very well."\r\n\r\n"He is truly _primitive_," said the Conte to the Duchessa. "And where\r\nwould Your Excellency be now," he went on with a smile, "if, while he\r\nwas galloping away hell for leather on this borrowed horse, it had taken\r\nit into its head to make a false step? You would be in the Spielberg, my\r\ndear young nephew, and all my authority would barely have managed to\r\nsecure the reduction by thirty pounds of the weight of the chain\r\nattached to each of your legs. You would have had some ten years to\r\nspend in that pleasure-resort; perhaps your legs would have become\r\nswollen and gangrened, then they would have cut them clean off."\r\n\r\n"Oh, for pity\'s sake, don\'t go any farther with so sad a romance!" cried\r\nthe Duchessa, with tears in her eyes. "Here he is back again. . . ."\r\n\r\n"And I am more delighted than you, you may well believe," replied the\r\nMinister with great seriousness, "but after all why did not this cruel\r\nboy come to me for a passport in a suitable name, since he was anxious\r\nto penetrate into Lombardy? On the first news of his arrest, I should\r\nhave set off for Milan, and the friends I have in those parts would have\r\nobligingly shut their eyes and pretended to believe that their police\r\nhad arrested a subject of the Prince of Parma. The story of your\r\nadventures is charming, amusing, I readily agree," the Conte went on,\r\nadopting a less sinister tone; "your rush from the wood on to the high\r\nroad quite thrills me; but, between ourselves, since this servant held\r\nyour life in his hands, you had the right to take his. We are about to\r\narrange a brilliant future for Your Excellency; at least, the Signora\r\nhere orders me to do so, and I do not believe that my greatest enemies\r\ncan accuse me of having ever disobeyed her commands. What a bitter grief\r\nfor her and for myself if, in this sort of steeplechase which you appear\r\nto have been riding on this thin horse, he had made a false step! It\r\nwould almost have been better," the Conte added, "if the horse had\r\nbroken your neck for you."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_GALEAZZO, DUKE OF MILAN_\r\n\r\n\r\n"You are very tragic this evening, my friend," said the Duchessa, quite\r\novercome.\r\n\r\n"That is because we are surrounded by tragic events," replied the Conte,\r\nalso with emotion; "we are not in France, where everything ends in song,\r\nor in imprisonment for a year or two, and really it is wrong of me to\r\nspeak of all this to you in a jocular tone. Well, now, my young nephew,\r\njust suppose that I find a chance to make you a Bishop, for really I\r\ncannot begin with the Archbishopric of Parma, as is desired, most\r\nreasonably, by the Signora Duchessa here present; in that Bishopric,\r\nwhere you will be far removed from our sage counsels, just tell us\r\nroughly what your policy will be?"\r\n\r\n"To kill the devil rather than let him kill me, in the admirable words\r\nof my friends the French," replied Fabrizio with blazing eyes; "to keep,\r\nby every means in my power, including pistols, the position you will\r\nhave secured for me. I have read in the del Dongo genealogy the story of\r\nthat ancestor of ours who built the castle of Grianta. Towards the end\r\nof his life, his good friend Galeazzo, Duke of Milan, sent him to visit\r\na fortress on our lake; they were afraid of another invasion by the\r\nSwiss. \'I must just write a few civil words to the governor,\' the Duke\r\nof Milan said to him as he was sending him off. He wrote and handed our\r\nancestor a note of a couple of lines; then he asked for it back to seal\r\nit. \'It will be more polite,\' the Prince explained. Vespasiano del Dongo\r\nstarted off, but, as he was sailing over the lake, an old Greek tale\r\ncame into his mind, for he was a man of learning; he opened his liege\r\nlord\'s letter and found inside an order addressed to the governor of the\r\ncastle to put him to death as soon as he should arrive. The Sforza, too\r\nmuch intent on the trick he was playing our ancestor, had left a space\r\nbetween the end of the letter and his signature; Vespasiano del Dongo\r\nwrote in this space an order proclaiming himself Governor General of all\r\nthe castles on the lake, and tore off the original letter. Arriving at\r\nthe fort, where his authority was duly acknowledged, he flung the\r\ncommandant down a well, declared war on the Sforza, and after a few\r\nyears exchanged his fortress for those vast estates which have made the\r\nfortune of every branch of our family, and one day will bring in to me,\r\npersonally, an income of four thousand lire."\r\n\r\n"You talk like an academician," exclaimed the Conte, laughing; "that was\r\na bold stroke with a vengeance; but it is only once in ten years that\r\none has a chance to do anything so sensational. A creature who is half\r\nan idiot, but who keeps a sharp look-out, and acts prudently all his\r\nlife, often enjoys the pleasure of triumphing over men of imagination.\r\nIt was by a foolish error of imagination that Napoleon was led to\r\nsurrender to the prudent _John Bull_, instead of seeking to conquer\r\nAmerica. John Bull, in his counting-house, had a hearty laugh at his\r\nletter in which he quotes Themistocles. In all ages, the base Sancho\r\nPanza triumphs, you will find, in the long run, over the sublime Don\r\nQuixote. If you are willing to agree to do nothing extraordinary, I have\r\nno doubt that you will be a highly respected, if not a highly\r\nrespectable Bishop. In any case, what I said just now holds good: Your\r\nExcellency acted with great levity in the affair of the horse; he was\r\nwithin a finger\'s breadth of perpetual imprisonment."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A CONQUEST_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis statement made Fabrizio shudder. He remained plunged in a profound\r\nastonishment. "Was that," he wondered, "the prison with which I am\r\nthreatened? Is that the crime which I was not to commit?" The\r\npredictions of Blan\xc3\xa8s, which as prophecies he utterly derided, assumed\r\nin his eyes all the importance of authentic forecasts.\r\n\r\n"Why, what is the matter with you?" the Duchessa asked him, in surprise;\r\n"the Conte has plunged you in a sea of dark thoughts."\r\n\r\n"I am illuminated by a new truth, and, instead of revolting against it,\r\nmy mind adopts it. It is true, I passed very near to an endless\r\nimprisonment! But that footman looked so nice in his English jacket! It\r\nwould have been such a pity to kill him!"\r\n\r\nThe Minister was enchanted with his little air of wisdom.\r\n\r\n"He is excellent in every respect," he said, with his eyes on the\r\nDuchessa. "I may tell you, my friend, that you have made a conquest, and\r\none that is perhaps the most desirable of all."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" thought Fabrizio, "now for some joke about little Marietta." He\r\nwas mistaken; the Conte went on to say:\r\n\r\n"Your _Gospel_ simplicity has won the heart of our venerable Archbishop,\r\nFather Landriani. One of these days we are going to make a Grand Vicar\r\nof you, and the charming part of the whole joke is that the three\r\nexisting Grand Vicars, all most deserving men, workers, two of whom, I\r\nfancy, were Grand Vicars before you were born, will demand, in a finely\r\nworded letter addressed to their Archbishop, that you shall rank first\r\namong them. These gentlemen base their plea in the first place upon your\r\nvirtues, and also upon the fact that you are the great-nephew of the\r\nfamous Archbishop Ascanio del Dongo. When I learned the respect that\r\nthey felt for your virtues, I immediately made the senior Vicar\r\nGeneral\'s nephew a captain; he had been a lieutenant ever since the\r\nsiege of Tarragona by Marshal Suchet."\r\n\r\n"Go right away now, dressed as you are, and pay a friendly visit to your\r\nArchbishop!" exclaimed the Duchessa. "Tell him about your sister\'s\r\nwedding; when he hears that she is to be a Duchessa, he will think you\r\nmore apostolic than ever. But, remember, you know nothing of what the\r\nConte has just told you about your future promotion."\r\n\r\nFabrizio hastened to the archi\xc3\xa9piscopal palace; there he shewed himself\r\nsimple and modest, a tone which he assumed only too easily; whereas it\r\nrequired an effort for him to play the great gentleman. As he listened\r\nto the somewhat prolix stories of Monsignor Landriani, he was saying to\r\nhimself: "Ought I to have fired my pistol at the footman who was leading\r\nthe thin horse?" His reason said to him: "Yes," but his heart could not\r\naccustom itself to the bleeding image of the handsome young man, falling\r\nfrom his horse, all disfigured.\r\n\r\n"That prison in which I should have been swallowed up, if the horse had\r\nstumbled, was that the prison with which I was threatened by all those\r\nforecasts?"\r\n\r\nThis question was of the utmost importance to him, and the Archbishop\r\nwas gratified by his air of profound attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\r\n\r\n\r\nOn leaving the Archbishop\'s Palace, Fabrizio hastened to see little\r\nMarietta; he could hear from the street the loud voice of Giletti who\r\nhad sent out for wine and was regaling himself with his friends the\r\nprompter and the candle-snuffers. The _mammaccia_, who played the part\r\nof mother, came alone in answer to his signal.\r\n\r\n"A lot has happened since you were here," she cried; "two or three of\r\nour actors are accused of having celebrated the great Napoleon\'s _festa_\r\nwith an orgy, and our poor company, which they say is Jacobin, has been\r\nordered to leave the States of Parma, and _evviva Napoleone_! But the\r\nMinister has had a finger in that pie, they say. One thing certain is\r\nthat Giletti has got money, I don\'t know how much, but I\'ve seen him\r\nwith a fistful of scudi. Marietta has had five scudi from our manager to\r\npay for the journey to Mantua and Venice, and I have had one. She is\r\nstill in love with you, but Giletti frightens her; three days ago, at\r\nthe last performance we gave, he absolutely wanted to kill her; he dealt\r\nher two proper blows, and, what was abominable of him, tore her blue\r\nshawl. If you would care to give her a blue shawl, you would be a very\r\ngood boy, and we can say that we won it in a lottery. The drum-major of\r\nthe _carabinieri_ is giving an assault-at-arms to-morrow, you will find\r\nthe hour posted up at all the street-corners. Come and see us; if he has\r\ngone to the assault, and we have any reason to hope that he will stay\r\naway for some time, I shall be at the window, and I shall give you a\r\nsignal to come up. Try to bring us something really nice, and Marietta\r\nwill be madly in love with you."\r\n\r\nAs he made his way down the winding staircase of this foul rookery,\r\nFabrizio was filled with compunction. "I have not altered in the least,"\r\nhe said to himself; "all the fine resolutions I made on the shore of our\r\nlake, when I looked at life with so philosophic an eye, have gone to the\r\nwinds. My mind has lost its normal balance; the whole thing was a dream,\r\nand vanishes before the stern reality. Now would be the time for action,"\r\nhe told himself as he entered the _palazzo_ Sanseverina about eleven\r\no\'clock that evening. But it was in vain that he sought in his heart for\r\nthe courage to speak with that sublime sincerity which had seemed to him\r\nso easy, the night he spent by the shore of the Lake of Como. "I am\r\ngoing to vex the person whom I love best in the world; if I speak, I\r\nshall simply seem to be jesting in the worst of taste; I am not worth\r\nanything, really, except in certain moments of exaltation.\r\n\r\n"The Conte has behaved admirably towards me," he said to the Duchessa,\r\nafter he had given her an account of his visit to the Archbishop\'s\r\nPalace; "I appreciate his conduct all the more, in that I think I am\r\nright in saying that personally I have made only a very moderate\r\nimpression on him: my behaviour towards him ought therefore to be\r\nstrictly correct. He has his excavations at Sanguigna, about which he is\r\nstill madly keen, if one is to judge, that is, by his expedition the day\r\nbefore yesterday: he went twelve leagues at a gallop in order to spend a\r\ncouple of hours with his workmen. If they find fragments of statues in\r\nthe ancient temple, the foundations of which he has just laid bare, he\r\nis afraid of their being stolen; I should like to propose to him that I\r\nshould go and spend a night or two at Sanguigna. To-morrow, about five,\r\nI have to see the Archbishop again; I can start in the evening and take\r\nadvantage of the cool night air for the journey."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_SANGUIGNA_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duchessa did not at first reply.\r\n\r\n"One would think you were seeking excuses for staying away from me," she\r\nsaid to him at length with extreme affection: "No sooner do you come\r\nback from Belgirate than you find a reason for going off again."\r\n\r\n"Here is a fine opportunity for speaking," thought Fabrizio. "But by the\r\nlake I was a trifle mad; I did not realise, in my enthusiasm for\r\nsincerity, that my compliment ended in an impertinence. It was a\r\nquestion of saying: \'I love you with the most devoted friendship, etc.,\r\netc., but my heart is not susceptible to love.\' Is not that as much as\r\nto say: \'I see that you are in love with me: but take care, I cannot pay\r\nyou back in the same coin.\' If it is love that she feels, the Duchessa\r\nmay be annoyed at its being guessed, and she will be revolted by my\r\nimpudence if all that she feels for me is friendship pure and\r\nsimple . . . and that is one of the offences people never forgive."\r\n\r\nWhile he weighed these important thoughts in his mind, Fabrizio, quite\r\nunconsciously, was pacing up and down the drawing-room with the grave\r\nair, full of dignity, of a man who sees disaster staring him in the\r\nface.\r\n\r\nThe Duchessa gazed at him with admiration; this was no longer the child\r\nshe had seen come into the world, this was no longer the nephew always\r\nready to obey her; this was a serious man, a man whom it would be\r\ndelicious to make fall in love with her. She rose from the ottoman on\r\nwhich she was sitting, and, flinging herself into his arms in a\r\ntransport of emotion:\r\n\r\n"So you want to run away from me?" she asked him.\r\n\r\n"No," he replied with the air of a Roman Emperor, "but I want to act\r\nwisely."\r\n\r\nThis speech was capable of several interpretations; Fabrizio did not\r\nfeel that he had the courage to go any farther and to run the risk of\r\nwounding this adorable woman. He was too young, too susceptible to\r\nsudden emotion; his brain could not supply him with any elegant turn of\r\nspeech to give expression to what he wished to say. By a natural\r\ntransport, and in defiance of all reason, he took this charming woman in\r\nhis arms and smothered her in kisses. At that moment the Conte\'s\r\ncarriage could be heard coming into the courtyard, and almost\r\nimmediately the Conte himself entered the room; he seemed greatly moved.\r\n\r\n"You inspire very singular passions," he said to Fabrizio, who stood\r\nstill, almost dumbfoundered by this remark.\r\n\r\n"The Archbishop had this evening the audience which His Serene Highness\r\ngrants him every Thursday; the Prince has just been telling me that the\r\nArchbishop, who seemed greatly troubled, began with a set speech,\r\nlearned by heart, and extremely clever, of which at first the Prince\r\ncould understand nothing at all. Landriani ended by declaring that it\r\nwas important for the Church in Parma that _Monsignor_ Fabrizio del Dongo\r\nshould be appointed his First Vicar General, and, in addition, as soon\r\nas he should have completed his twenty-fourth year, his Coadjutor _with\r\neventual succession_.\r\n\r\n"The last clause alarmed me, I must admit," said the Conte: "it is going\r\na little too fast, and I was afraid of an outburst from the Prince; but\r\nhe looked at me with a smile, and said to me in French: \'Ce sont l\xc3\xa0 de\r\nvos coups, monsieur!\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE AUDIENCE_\r\n\r\n\r\n"\'I can take my oath, before God and before Your Highness,\' I exclaimed\r\nwith all the unction possible, \'that I knew absolutely nothing about the\r\nwords _eventual succession_.\' Then I told him the truth, what in fact we\r\nwere discussing together here a few hours ago; I added, impulsively,\r\nthat, so far as the future was concerned, I should regard myself as most\r\nbounteously rewarded with His Highness\'s favour if he would deign to\r\nallow me a minor Bishopric to begin with. The Prince must have believed\r\nme, for he thought fit to be gracious; he said to me with the greatest\r\npossible simplicity: \'This is an official matter between the Archbishop\r\nand myself; you do not come into it at all; the worthy man delivered me\r\na kind of report, of great length and tedious to a degree, at the end of\r\nwhich he came to an official proposal; I answered him very coldly that\r\nthe person in question was extremely young, and, moreover, a very recent\r\narrival at my court, that I should almost be giving the impression that\r\nI was honouring a bill of exchange drawn upon me by the Emperor, in\r\ngiving the prospect of so high a dignity to the son of one of the\r\nprincipal officers of his Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom. The Archbishop\r\nprotested that no recommendation of that sort had been made. That was a\r\npretty stupid thing to say to _me_. I was surprised to hear it come from a\r\nman of his experience; but he always loses his head when he speaks to\r\nme, and this evening he was more troubled than ever, which gave me the\r\nidea that he was passionately anxious to secure the appointment. I told\r\nhim that I knew better than he that there had been no recommendation\r\nfrom any high quarter in favour of this del Dongo, that nobody at my\r\ncourt denied his capacity, that they did not speak at all too badly of\r\nhis morals, but that I was afraid of his being liable to enthusiasm, and\r\nthat I had made it a rule never to promote to considerable positions\r\nfools of that sort, with whom a Prince can never be sure of anything.\r\nThen,\' His Highness went on, \'I had to submit to a fresh tirade almost\r\nas long as the first; the Archbishop sang me the praises of the\r\nenthusiasm of the _Casa di Dio_. Clumsy fellow, I said to myself, you\r\nare going astray, you are endangering an appointment which was almost\r\nconfirmed; you ought to have cut your speech short and thanked me\r\neffusively. Not a bit of it; he continued his homily with a ridiculous\r\nintrepidity; I had to think of a reply which would not be too\r\nunfavourable to young del Dongo; I found one, and by no means a bad one,\r\nas you shall judge for yourself. Monsignore, I said to him, Pius VII was\r\na great Pope and a great saint: among all the Sovereigns, he alone dared\r\nto say _No_ to the tyrant who saw Europe at his feet: very well, he was\r\nliable to enthusiasm, which led him, when he was Bishop of Imola, to\r\nwrite that famous Pastoral of the _Citizen-Cardinal_ Chiaramonti, in\r\nsupport of the Cisalpine Republic.\r\n\r\n"\'My poor Archbishop was left stupefied, and, to complete his\r\nstupefaction, I said to him with a very serious air: Good-bye,\r\nMonsignore, I shall take twenty-four hours to consider your proposal.\r\nThe poor man added various supplications, by no means well expressed and\r\ndistinctly inopportune after the word _Good-bye_ had been uttered by me.\r\nNow, Conte Mosca della Rovere, I charge you to inform the Duchessa that\r\nI have no wish to delay for twenty-four hours a decision which may be\r\nagreeable to her; sit down there and write the Archbishop the letter of\r\napproval which will bring the whole matter to an end.\' I wrote the\r\nletter, he signed it, and said to me: \'Take it, immediately, to the\r\nDuchessa.\' Here, Signora, is the letter, and it is this that has given\r\nme an excuse for taking the pleasure of seeing you again this evening."\r\n\r\nThe Duchessa read the letter with rapture. While the Conte was telling\r\nhis long story, Fabrizio had had time to collect himself: he shewed no\r\nsign of astonishment at the incident, he took the whole thing like a\r\ntrue nobleman who naturally has always supposed himself entitled to\r\nthese extraordinary advancements, these strokes of fortune which would\r\nunhinge a plebeian mind; he spoke of his gratitude, but in polished\r\nterms, and ended by saying to the Conte:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_TITULAR AND COADJUTOR_\r\n\r\n\r\n"A good courtier ought to flatter the ruling passion; yesterday you\r\nexpressed the fear that your workmen at Sanguigna might steal any\r\nfragments of ancient sculpture they brought to light; I am extremely\r\nfond of excavation, myself; with your kind permission, I will go to\r\nsuperintend the workmen. To-morrow evening, after suitably expressing my\r\nthanks at the Palace and to the Archbishop, I shall start for\r\nSanguigna."\r\n\r\n"But can you guess," the Duchessa asked the Conte, "what can have given\r\nrise to this sudden passion on our good Archbishop\'s part for Fabrizio?"\r\n\r\n"I have no need to guess; the Grand Vicar whose nephew I made a captain\r\nsaid to me yesterday: \'Father Landriani starts from this absolute\r\nprinciple, that the titular is superior to the coadjutor, and is beside\r\nhimself with joy at the prospect of having a del Dongo under his orders,\r\nand of having done him a service.\' Everything that can draw attention to\r\nFabrizio\'s noble birth adds to his secret happiness: that he should have\r\na man like that as his aide-de-camp! In the second place, Monsignor\r\nFabrizio has taken his fancy, he does not feel in the least shy before\r\nhim; finally, he has been nourishing for the last ten years a very\r\nvigorous hatred of the Bishop of Piacenza, who openly boasts of his\r\nclaim to succeed him in the see of Parma, and is moreover the son of a\r\nmiller. It is with a view to this eventual succession that the Bishop of\r\nPiacenza has formed very close relations with the Marchesa Raversi, and\r\nnow their intimacy is making the Archbishop tremble for the success of\r\nhis favourite scheme, to have a del Dongo on his staff and to give him\r\norders."\r\n\r\nTwo days after this, at an early hour in the morning, Fabrizio was\r\ndirecting the work of excavation at Sanguigna, opposite Colorno (which\r\nis the Versailles of the Princes of Parma); these excavations extended\r\nover the plain close to the high road which runs from Parma to the bridge\r\nof Casalmaggiore, the first town on Austrian territory. The workmen were\r\nintersecting the plain with a long trench, eight feet deep and as narrow\r\nas possible: they were engaged in seeking, along the old Roman Way, for\r\nthe ruins of a second temple which, according to local reports, had\r\nstill been in existence in the middle ages. Despite the Prince\'s orders,\r\nmany of the _contadini_ looked with misgivings on these long ditches\r\nrunning across their property. Whatever one might say to them, they\r\nimagined that a search was being made for treasure, and Fabrizio\'s\r\npresence was especially desirable with a view to preventing any little\r\nunrest. He was by no means bored, he followed the work with keen\r\ninterest; from time to time they turned up some medal, and he saw to it\r\nthat the workmen did not have time to arrange among themselves to make\r\noff with it.\r\n\r\nThe day was fine, the time about six o\'clock in the morning: he had\r\nborrowed an old gun, single-barrelled; he shot several larks; one of\r\nthem, wounded, was falling upon the high road. Fabrizio, as he went\r\nafter it, caught sight, in the distance, of a carriage that was coming\r\nfrom Parma and making for the frontier at Casalmaggiore. He had just\r\nreloaded his gun when, the carriage which was extremely dilapidated\r\ncoming towards him at a snail\'s pace, he recognised little Marietta; she\r\nhad, on either side of her, the big bully Giletti and the old woman whom\r\nshe passed off as her mother.\r\n\r\nGiletti imagined that Fabrizio had posted himself there in the middle of\r\nthe road, and with a gun in his hand, to insult him, and perhaps even to\r\ncarry off his little Marietta. Like a man of valour, he jumped down from\r\nthe carriage; he had in his left hand a large and very rusty pistol, and\r\nheld in his right a sheathed sword, which he used when the limitations\r\nof the company obliged them to cast him for the part of some Marchese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_GILETTI_\r\n\r\n\r\n"Ha! Brigand!" he shouted, "I am very glad to find you here, a league\r\nfrom the frontier; I\'ll settle your account for you, right away; you\'re\r\nnot protected here by your violet stockings."\r\n\r\nFabrizio was engaged in smiling at little Marietta, and barely heeding\r\nthe jealous shouts of Giletti, when suddenly he saw within three feet of\r\nhis chest the muzzle of the rusty pistol; he was just in time to aim a\r\nblow at it, using his gun as a club: the pistol went off, but did not\r\nhit anyone.\r\n\r\n"Stop, will you, you ----," cried Giletti to the _vetturino_; at the\r\nsame time he was quick enough to spring to the muzzle of his adversary\'s\r\ngun and to hold it so that it pointed away from his body; Fabrizio and\r\nhe pulled at the gun, each with his whole strength. Giletti, who was a\r\ngreat deal the more vigorous of the two, placing one hand in front of\r\nthe other, kept creeping forward towards the lock, and was on the point\r\nof snatching away the gun when Fabrizio, to prevent him from making use\r\nof it, fired. He had indeed seen, first, that the muzzle of the gun was\r\nmore than three inches above Giletti\'s shoulder: still, the detonation\r\noccurred close to the man\'s ear. He was somewhat startled at first, but\r\nat once recovered himself:\r\n\r\n"Oh, so you want to blow my head off, you scum! Just let me settle your\r\nreckoning." Giletti flung away the scabbard of his Marchese\'s sword, and\r\nfell upon Fabrizio with admirable swiftness. Our hero had no weapon, and\r\ngave himself up for lost.\r\n\r\nHe made for the carriage, which had stopped some ten yards beyond\r\nGiletti; he passed to the left of it, and, grasping the spring of the\r\ncarriage in his hand, made a quick turn which brought him level with the\r\ndoor on the right hand side, which stood open. Giletti, who had started\r\noff on his long legs and had not thought of checking himself by catching\r\nhold of the spring, went on for several paces in the same direction\r\nbefore he could stop. As Fabrizio passed by the open door, he heard\r\nMarietta whisper to him:\r\n\r\n"Take care of yourself; he will kill you. Here!"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, Fabrizio saw fall from the door a sort of big hunting\r\nknife, he stooped to pick it up, but as he did so was wounded in the\r\nshoulder by a blow from Giletti\'s sword. Fabrizio, on rising to his\r\nfeet, found himself within six inches of Giletti, who struck him a\r\nfurious blow in the face with the hilt of his sword; this blow was\r\ndelivered with so much force that it completely took away Fabrizio\'s\r\nsenses. At that moment, he was on the point of being killed. Fortunately\r\nfor him, Giletti was still too near to be able to give him a thrust with\r\nthe point. Fabrizio, when he came to himself, took to flight, and ran as\r\nfast as his legs would carry him; as he ran, he flung away the sheath of\r\nthe hunting knife, and then, turning smartly round, found himself three\r\npaces ahead of Giletti, who was in pursuit. Giletti rushed on, Fabrizio\r\nstruck at him with the point of his knife; Giletti was in time to beat\r\nup the knife a little with his sword, but he received the point of the\r\nblade full in the left cheek. He passed close by Fabrizio who felt his\r\nthigh pierced: it was Giletti\'s knife, which he had found time to open.\r\nFabrizio sprang to the right; he turned round, and at last the two\r\nadversaries found themselves at a proper fighting distance.\r\n\r\nGiletti swore like a lost soul: "Ah! I shall slit your throat for you,\r\nyou rascally priest," he kept on repeating every moment. Fabrizio was\r\nquite out of breath and could not speak: the blow on his face from the\r\nsword-hilt was causing him a great deal of pain, and his nose was\r\nbleeding abundantly. He parried a number of strokes with his hunting\r\nknife, and made a number of passes without knowing quite what he was\r\ndoing. He had a vague feeling that he was at a public display. This idea\r\nhad been suggested to him by the presence of the workmen, who, to the\r\nnumber of twenty-five or thirty, formed a circle round the combatants,\r\nbut at a most respectful distance; for at every moment they saw them\r\nstart to run, and spring upon one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A DUEL_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fight seemed to be slackening a little; the strokes no longer\r\nfollowed one another with the same rapidity, when Fabrizio said to\r\nhimself: "To judge by the pain which I feel in my face, he must have\r\ndisfigured me." In a spasm of rage at this idea, he leaped upon his\r\nenemy with the point of his hunting knife forwards. This point entered\r\nGiletti\'s chest on the right side and passed out near his left shoulder;\r\nat the same moment Giletti\'s sword passed right to the hilt through the\r\nupper part of Fabrizio\'s arm, but the blade glided under the skin and\r\nthe wound was not serious.\r\n\r\nGiletti had fallen; as Fabrizio advanced towards him, looking down at\r\nhis left hand which was clasping a knife, that hand opened mechanically\r\nand let the weapon slip to the ground.\r\n\r\n"The rascal is dead," said Fabrizio to himself. He looked at Giletti\'s\r\nface: blood was pouring from his mouth. Fabrizio ran to the carriage.\r\n\r\n"Have you a mirror?" he cried to Marietta. Marietta stared at him,\r\ndeadly pale, and made no answer. The old woman with great coolness\r\nopened a green workbag and handed Fabrizio a little mirror with a\r\nhandle, no bigger than his hand. Fabrizio as he looked at himself felt\r\nhis face carefully: "My eyes are all right," he said to himself, "that\r\nis something, at any rate." He examined his teeth; they were not broken\r\nat all. "Then how is it that I am in such pain?" he asked himself,\r\nhalf-aloud.\r\n\r\nThe old woman answered him:\r\n\r\n"It is because the top of your cheek has been crushed between the hilt\r\nof Giletti\'s sword and the bone we keep there. Your cheek is horribly\r\nswollen and blue: put leeches on it instantly, and it will be all\r\nright."\r\n\r\n"Ah! Leeches, instantly!" said Fabrizio with a laugh, and recovered all\r\nhis coolness. He saw that the workmen had gathered round Giletti, and\r\nwere gazing at him, without venturing to touch him.\r\n\r\n"Look after that man there!" he called to them; "take his coat off." He\r\nwas going to say more, but, on raising his eyes, saw five or six men at\r\na distance of three hundred yards on the high road, who were advancing\r\non foot and at a measured pace towards the scene of action.\r\n\r\n"They are police," he thought, "and, as there has been a man killed,\r\nthey will arrest me, and I shall have the honour of making a solemn\r\nentry into the city of Parma. What a story for the Raversi\'s friends at\r\ncourt who detest my aunt!"\r\n\r\nImmediately, with the rapidity of a flash of lightning, he flung to the\r\nopen-mouthed workmen all the money that he had in his pockets and leaped\r\ninto the carriage.\r\n\r\n"Stop the police from pursuing me!" he cried to his men, "and your\r\nfortunes are all made; tell them that I am innocent, that this man\r\n_attacked me and wanted to kill me_."\r\n\r\n"And you," he said to the _vetturino_, "make your horses gallop; you shall\r\nhave four golden napoleons if you cross the Po before these people\r\nbehind can overtake me."\r\n\r\n"Right you are," said the man; "but there\'s nothing to be afraid of:\r\nthose men back there are on foot, and my little horses have only to trot\r\nto leave them properly in the lurch." So saying, he put the animals into\r\na gallop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PRECAUTIONS_\r\n\r\n\r\nOur hero was shocked to hear the word "afraid" used by the driver: the\r\nfact being that really he had been extremely afraid after the blow from\r\nthe sword-hilt which had struck him in the face.\r\n\r\n"We may run into people on horseback coming towards us," said the\r\nprudent _vetturino_, thinking of the four napoleons, "and the men who\r\nare following us may call out to them to stop us. . . ." Which meant, in\r\nother words: "Reload your weapons."\r\n\r\n"Oh, how brave you are, my little Abate!" cried Marietta as she embraced\r\nFabrizio. The old woman was looking out through the window of the\r\ncarriage; presently she drew in her head.\r\n\r\n"No one is following you, sir," she said to Fabrizio with great\r\ncoolness; "and there is no one on the road in front of you. You know how\r\nparticular the officials of the Austrian police are: if they see you\r\narrive like this at a gallop, along the embankment by the Po, they will\r\narrest you, no doubt about it."\r\n\r\nFabrizio looked out of the window.\r\n\r\n"Trot," he said to the driver. "What passport have you?" he asked the\r\nold woman.\r\n\r\n"Three, instead of one," she replied, "and they cost us four francs\r\napiece; a dreadful thing, isn\'t it, for poor dramatic artists who are\r\nkept travelling all the year round! Here is the passport of Signor\r\nGiletti, dramatic artist: that will be you; here are our two passports,\r\nMarietta\'s and mine. But Giletti had all our money in his pocket; what\r\nis to become of us?"\r\n\r\n"What had he?" Fabrizio asked.\r\n\r\n"Forty good scudi of five francs," said the old woman.\r\n\r\n"You mean six, and some small change," said Marietta with a smile: "I\r\nwon\'t have my little Abate cheated."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it only natural, sir," replied the old woman with great coolness,\r\n"that I should try to tap you for thirty-four scudi? What are\r\nthirty-four scudi to you, and we--we have lost our protector. Who is\r\nthere now to find us lodgings, to beat down prices with the _vetturini_\r\nwhen we are on the road, and to put the fear of God into everyone?\r\nGiletti was not beautiful, but he was most useful; and if the little\r\ngirl there hadn\'t been a fool, and fallen in love with you from the\r\nfirst, Giletti would never have noticed anything, and you would have\r\ngiven us good money. I can assure you that we are very poor."\r\n\r\nFabrizio was touched; he took out his purse and gave several napoleons\r\nto the old woman.\r\n\r\n"You see," he said to her, "I have only fifteen left, so it is no use\r\nyour trying to pull my leg any more."\r\n\r\nLittle Marietta flung her arms round his neck, and the old woman kissed\r\nhis hands. The carriage was moving all this time at a slow trot. When\r\nthey saw in the distance the yellow barriers striped with black which\r\nindicated the beginning of Austrian territory, the old woman said to\r\nFabrizio:\r\n\r\n"You would do best to cross the frontier on foot with Giletti\'s passport\r\nin your pocket; as for us, we shall stop for a minute, on the excuse of\r\nmaking ourselves tidy. And besides, the _dogana_ will want to look at\r\nour things. If you will take my advice, you will go through\r\nCasalmaggiore at a careless stroll; even go into the _caff\xc3\xa8_ and drink\r\na glass of brandy, once you are past the village, put your best foot\r\nforemost. The police are as sharp as the devil in an Austrian country;\r\nthey will pretty soon know there has been a man killed; you are\r\ntravelling with a passport which is not yours, that is more than enough\r\nto get you two years in prison. Make for the Po on your right after you\r\nleave the town, hire a boat and get away to Ravenna or Ferrara; get\r\nclear of the Austrian States as quickly as ever you can. With a couple\r\nof louis you should be able to buy another passport from some\r\n_doganiere_; it would be fatal to use this one; don\'t forget that you\r\nhave killed the man."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_FEAR_\r\n\r\n\r\nAs he approached, on foot, the bridge of boats at Casalmaggiore,\r\nFabrizio carefully reread Giletti\'s passport. Our hero was in great\r\nfear, he recalled vividly all that Conte Mosca had said to him about the\r\ndanger involved in his entering Austrian territory; well, two hundred\r\nyards ahead of him he saw the terrible bridge which was about to give\r\nhim access to that country, the capital of which, in his eyes, was the\r\nSpielberg. But what else was he to do? The Duchy of Modena, which\r\nmarches with the State of Parma on the South, returned its fugitives in\r\ncompliance with a special convention, the frontier of the State which\r\nextends over the mountains in the direction of Genoa was too far off;\r\nhis misadventure would be known at Parma long before he could reach\r\nthose mountains; there remained therefore nothing but the Austrian\r\nStates on the left bank of the Po. Before there was time to write to the\r\nAustrian authorities asking them to arrest him, thirty-six hours, or\r\neven two days must elapse. All these considerations duly weighed,\r\nFabrizio set a light with his cigar to his own passport; it was better\r\nfor him, on Austrian soil, to be a vagabond than to be Fabrizio del\r\nDongo, and it was possible that they might search him.\r\n\r\nQuite apart from the very natural repugnance which he felt towards\r\nentrusting his life to the passport of the unfortunate Giletti, this\r\ndocument presented material difficulties. Fabrizio\'s height was, at the\r\nmost, five feet five inches, and not five feet ten inches as was stated\r\non the passport. He was not quite twenty-four, and looked younger.\r\nGiletti had been thirty-nine. We must confess that our hero paced for a\r\ngood half-hour along a flood-barrier of the Po near the bridge of boats\r\nbefore making up his mind to go down on to it. "What should I advise\r\nanyone else to do in my place?" he asked himself finally. "Obviously, to\r\ncross: there is danger in remaining in the State of Parma; a constable\r\nmay be sent in pursuit of the man who has killed another man, even in\r\nself-defence." Fabrizio went through his pocket, tore up all his papers,\r\nand kept literally nothing but his handkerchief and his cigar-case; it\r\nwas important for him to curtail the examination which he would have to\r\nundergo. He thought of a terrible objection which might be raised, and\r\nto which he could find no satisfactory answer: he was going to say that\r\nhis name was Giletti, and all his linen was marked F. D.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, Fabrizio was one of those unfortunates who are\r\ntormented by their imagination; it is a characteristic fault of men of\r\nintelligence in Italy. A French soldier of equal or even inferior\r\ncourage would have gone straight to the bridge and have crossed it\r\nwithout more ado, without thinking beforehand of any possible\r\ndifficulties; but also he would have carried with him all his coolness,\r\nand Fabrizio was far from feeling cool when, at the end of the bridge, a\r\nlittle man, dressed in grey, said to him: "Go into the police office and\r\nshew your passport."\r\n\r\nThis office had dirty walls studded with nails from which hung the pipes\r\nand the soiled hats of the officials. The big deal table behind which\r\nthey were installed was spotted all over with stains of ink and wine;\r\ntwo or three fat registers bound in raw hide bore stains of all colours,\r\nand the margins of the pages were black with finger-marks. On top of the\r\nregisters which were piled one on another lay three magnificent wreaths\r\nof laurel which had done duty a couple of days before for one of the\r\nEmperor\'s festivals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE PASSPORT_\r\n\r\n\r\nFabrizio was impressed by all these details; they gave him a tightening\r\nof the heart; this was the price he must pay for the magnificent luxury,\r\nso cool and clean, that caught the eye in his charming rooms in the\r\n_palazzo_ Sanseverina. He was obliged to enter this dirty office and to\r\nappear there as an inferior; he was about to undergo an examination.\r\n\r\nThe official who stretched out a yellow hand to take his passport was\r\nsmall and dark. He wore a brass pin in his necktie. "This is an\r\nill-tempered fellow," thought Fabrizio. The gentleman seemed excessively\r\nsurprised as he read the passport, and his perusal of it lasted fully\r\nfive minutes.\r\n\r\n"You have met with an accident," he said to the stranger, looking at his\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\n"The _vetturino_ flung us out over the embankment."\r\n\r\nThen the silence was resumed, and the official cast sour glances at the\r\ntraveller.\r\n\r\n"I see it now," Fabrizio said to himself, "he is going to inform me that\r\nhe is sorry to have bad news to give me, and that I am under arrest."\r\nAll sorts of wild ideas surged simultaneously into our hero\'s brain,\r\nwhich at this moment was not very logical. For instance, he thought of\r\nescaping by a door in the office which stood open. "I get rid of my\r\ncoat, I jump into the Po, and no doubt I shall be able to swim across\r\nit. Anything is better than the Spielberg." The police official was\r\nstaring fixedly at him, while he calculated the chances of success of\r\nthis dash for safety; they furnished two interesting types of the human\r\ncountenance. The presence of danger gives a touch of genius to the\r\nreasoning man, places him, so to speak, above his own level: in the\r\nimaginative man it inspires romances, bold, it is true, but frequently\r\nabsurd.\r\n\r\nYou ought to have seen the indignant air of our hero under the searching\r\neye of this police official, adorned with his brass jewelry. "If I were\r\nto kill him," thought Fabrizio, "I should be convicted of murder and\r\nsentenced to twenty years in the galleys, or to death, which is a great\r\ndeal less terrible than the Spielberg with a chain weighing a hundred\r\nand twenty pounds on each foot and nothing but eight ounces of bread to\r\nlive on; and that lasts for twenty years; so that I should not get out\r\nuntil I was forty-four." Fabrizio\'s logic overlooked the fact that, as\r\nhe had burned his own passport, there was nothing to indicate to the\r\npolice official that he was the rebel, Fabrizio del Dongo.\r\n\r\nOur hero was sufficiently alarmed, as we have seen; he would have been a\r\ngreat deal more so could he have read the thoughts that were disturbing\r\nthe official\'s mind. This man was a friend of Giletti; one may judge of\r\nhis surprise when he saw his friend\'s passport in the hands of a\r\nstranger; his first impulse was to have that stranger arrested, then he\r\nreflected that Giletti might easily have sold his passport to this fine\r\nyoung man who apparently had just been doing something disgraceful at\r\nParma. "If I arrest him," he said to himself, "Giletti will get into\r\ntrouble; they will at once discover that he has sold his passport; on\r\nthe other hand, what will my chiefs say if it is proved that I, a friend\r\nof Giletti, put a _visa_ on his passport when it was carried by someone\r\nelse." The official got up with a yawn and said to Fabrizio: "Wait a\r\nminute, sir"; then, adopting a professional formula, added: "A\r\ndifficulty has arisen." On which Fabrizio murmured: "What is going to\r\narise is my escape."\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the official went out of the office, leaving the\r\ndoor open; and the passport was left lying on the deal table. "The\r\ndanger is obvious," thought Fabrizio; "I shall take my passport and walk\r\nslowly back across the bridge; I shall tell the constable, if he\r\nquestions me, that I forgot to have my passport examined by the\r\ncommissary of police in the last village in the State of Parma."\r\nFabrizio had already taken the passport in his hand when, to his\r\nunspeakable astonishment, he heard the clerk with the brass jewelry say:\r\n\r\n"Upon my soul, I can\'t do any more work; the heat is stifling; I am\r\ngoing to the _caff\xc3\xa8_ to have half a glass. Go into the office when you\r\nhave finished your pipe, there\'s a passport to be stamped; the party is\r\nin there."\r\n\r\nFabrizio, who was stealing out on tiptoe, found himself face to face\r\nwith a handsome young man who was saying to himself, or rather humming:\r\n"Well, let us see this passport; I\'ll put my scrawl on it."\r\n\r\n"Where does the gentleman wish to go?"\r\n\r\n"To Mantua, Venice and Ferrara."\r\n\r\n"Ferrara it is," said the official, whistling; he took up a die, stamped\r\nthe _visa_ in blue ink on the passport, rapidly wrote in the words:\r\n"Mantua, Venice and Ferrara," in the space left blank by the stamp, then\r\nwaved his hand several times in the air, signed, and dipped his pen in\r\nthe ink to make his flourish, which he executed slowly and with infinite\r\npains. Fabrizio followed every movement of his pen; the clerk studied\r\nhis flourish with satisfaction, adding five or six finishing touches,\r\nthen handed the passport back to Fabrizio, saying in a careless tone: "A\r\ngood journey, sir!"\r\n\r\nFabrizio made off at a pace the alacrity of which he was endeavouring to\r\nconceal, when he felt himself caught by the left arm: instinctively his\r\nhand went to the hilt of his dagger, and if he had not observed that he\r\nwas surrounded by houses he might perhaps have done something rash. The\r\nman who was touching his left arm, seeing that he appeared quite\r\nstartled, said by way of apology:\r\n\r\n"But I called the gentleman three times, and got no answer; has the\r\ngentleman anything to declare before the customs?"\r\n\r\n"I have nothing on me but my handkerchief; I am going to a place quite\r\nnear here, to shoot with one of my family."\r\n\r\nHe would have been greatly embarrassed had he been asked to name this\r\nrelative. What with the great heat and his various emotions, Fabrizio\r\nwas as wet as if he had fallen into the Po. "I am not lacking in courage\r\nto face actors, but clerks with brass jewelry send me out of my mind; I\r\nshall make a humorous sonnet out of that to amuse the Duchessa."\r\n\r\nEntering Casalmaggiore, Fabrizio at once turned to the right along a\r\nmean street which leads down to the Po. "I am in great need," he said to\r\nhimself, "of the succour of Bacchus and Ceres," and he entered a shop\r\noutside which there hung a grey clout fastened to a stick; on the clout\r\nwas inscribed the word _Trattoria_. A meagre piece of bed-linen\r\nsupported on two slender wooden hoops and hanging down to within three\r\nfeet of the ground sheltered the doorway of the _Trattoria_ from the\r\nvertical rays of the sun. There, a half-undressed and extremely pretty\r\nwoman received our hero with respect, which gave him the keenest\r\npleasure; he hastened to inform her that he was dying of hunger. While\r\nthe woman was preparing his breakfast, there entered a man of about\r\nthirty; he had given no greeting on coming in; suddenly he rose from the\r\nbench on which he had flung himself down with a familiar air, and said\r\nto Fabrizio: "_Eccellenza, la riverisco_! (Excellency, your servant!)"\r\nFabrizio was in the highest spirits at the moment, and, instead of\r\nforming sinister plans, replied with a laugh: "And how the devil do you\r\nknow my Excellency?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE TRATTORIA_\r\n\r\n\r\n"What! Doesn\'t Your Excellency remember Lodovico, one of the Signora\r\nDuchessa Sanseverina\'s coachmen? At Sacca, the place in the country\r\nwhere we used to go every year, I always took fever; I asked the Signora\r\nfor a pension, and retired from service. Now I am rich; instead of the\r\npension of twelve scudi a year, which was the most I was entitled to\r\nexpect, the Signora told me that, to give me the leisure to compose\r\nsonnets, for I am a poet in the _lingua volgare_, she would allow me\r\ntwenty-four scudi and the Signor Conte told me that if ever I was in\r\ndifficulties I had only to come and tell him. I have had the honour to\r\ndrive Monsignore for a stage, when he went to make his retreat, like a\r\ngood Christian, in the Certosa of Velleja."\r\n\r\nFabrizio studied the man\'s face and began to recognise him. He had been\r\none of the smartest coachmen in the Sanseverina establishment; now that\r\nhe was what he called rich his entire clothing consisted of a coarse\r\nshirt, in holes, and a pair of cloth breeches, dyed black at some time\r\nin the past, which barely came down to his knees; a pair of shoes and a\r\nvillainous hat completed his equipment. In addition to this, he had not\r\nshaved for a fortnight. As he ate his omelette Fabrizio engaged in\r\nconversation with him, absolutely as between equals; he thought he\r\ndetected that Lodovico was in love with their hostess. He finished his\r\nmeal rapidly, then said in a low voice to Lodovico: "I want a word with\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Your Excellency can speak openly before her, she is a really good\r\nwoman," said Lodovico with a tender air.\r\n\r\n"Very well, my friends," said Fabrizio without hesitation, "I am in\r\ntrouble, and have need of your help. First of all, there is nothing\r\npolitical about my case; I have simply and solely killed a man who\r\nwanted to murder me because I spoke to his mistress."\r\n\r\n"Poor young man!" said the landlady.\r\n\r\n"Your Excellency can count on me!" cried the coachman, his eyes ablaze\r\nwith the most passionate devotion; "where does His Excellency wish to\r\ngo?"\r\n\r\n"To Ferrara. I have a passport, but I should prefer not to speak to the\r\npolice, who may have received information of what has happened."\r\n\r\n"When did you despatch this fellow?"\r\n\r\n"This morning, at six o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"Your Excellency has no blood on his clothes, has he?" asked the\r\nlandlady.\r\n\r\n"I was thinking of that," put in the coachman, "and besides, the cloth\r\nof that coat is too fine; you don\'t see many like that in the country\r\nround here, it would make people stare at us; I shall go and buy some\r\nclothes from the Jew. Your Excellency is about my figure, only thinner."\r\n\r\n"For pity\'s sake, don\'t go on calling me Excellency, it may attract\r\nattention."\r\n\r\n"Very good, Excellency," replied the coachman, as he left the tavern.\r\n\r\n"Here, here," Fabrizio called after him, "and what about the money! Come\r\nback!"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean--money!" said the landlady; "he has sixty-seven scudi\r\nwhich are entirely at your service. I myself," she went on, lowering her\r\nvoice, "have forty scudi which I offer you with the best will in the\r\nworld; one doesn\'t always have money on one when these accidents\r\nhappen."\r\n\r\nOn account of the heat, Fabrizio had taken off his coat on entering the\r\n_Trattoria_.\r\n\r\n"You have a waistcoat on you which might land us in trouble if anyone\r\ncame in: that fine _English cloth_ would attract attention." She gave our\r\nfugitive a stuff waistcoat, dyed black, which belonged to her husband. A\r\ntall young man came into the tavern by an inner door; he was dressed\r\nwith a certain style.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE LANDLADY_\r\n\r\n\r\n"This is my husband," said the landlady. "Pietro-Antonio," she said to\r\nher husband, "this gentleman is a friend of Lodovico; he met with an\r\naccident this morning, across the river, and he wants to get away to\r\nFerrara."\r\n\r\n"Oh, we\'ll get him there," said the husband with an air of great\r\ngentility; "we have Carlo-Giuseppe\'s boat."\r\n\r\nOwing to another weakness in our hero which we shall confess as\r\nnaturally as we have related his fear in the police office at the end of\r\nthe bridge, there were tears in his eyes; he was profoundly moved by the\r\nperfect devotion which he found among these _contadini_; he thought also\r\nof this characteristic generosity of his aunt; he would have liked to be\r\nable to make these people\'s fortune. Lodovico returned, carrying a\r\npacket.\r\n\r\n"So that\'s finished," the husband said to him in a friendly tone.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not that," replied Lodovico in evident alarm, "people are\r\nbeginning to talk about you, they noticed that you hesitated before\r\nturning down our _vicolo_ and leaving the big street, like a man who was\r\ntrying to hide."\r\n\r\n"Go up quick to the bedroom," said the husband.\r\n\r\nThis room, which was very large and fine, had grey cloth instead of\r\nglass in its two windows; it contained four beds, each six feet wide and\r\nfive feet high.\r\n\r\n"Be quick! Be quick!" said Lodovico, "there is a swaggering fool of a\r\nconstable who has just been posted here and began trying to make love to\r\nthe pretty lady downstairs; and I\'ve told him that when he goes\r\ntravelling about the country he may find himself stopping a bullet. If\r\nthe dog hears any mention of Your Excellency, he\'ll want to do us a bad\r\nturn, he will try to arrest you here, so as to get Teodolinda\'s\r\n_Trattoria_ a bad name.\r\n\r\n"What\'s this?" Lodovico went on, seeing Fabrizio\'s shirt all stained\r\nwith blood and his wounds bandaged with handkerchiefs, "so the _porco_\r\nshewed fight, did he? That\'s a hundred times more than you need to get\r\nyourself arrested, and I haven\'t bought you any shirt." Without ceremony\r\nhe opened the husband\'s wardrobe and gave one of his shirts to Fabrizio,\r\nwho was soon attired like a prosperous countryman. Lodovico took down a\r\nnet that was hanging on the wall, placed Fabrizio\'s clothes in the\r\nbasket in which the fish are put, went downstairs at a run and hastened\r\nout of the house by a back door; Fabrizio followed him.\r\n\r\n"Teodolinda," he called out as he passed by the bar, "hide what I\'ve\r\nleft upstairs, we are going to wait among the willows, and you,\r\nPietro-Antonio, send us a boat quickly, we\'ll pay well for it."\r\n\r\nLodovico led Fabrizio across more than a score of ditches. There were\r\nplanks, very long and very elastic, which served as bridges across the\r\nwider of these ditches; Lodovico took up these planks after crossing by\r\nthem. On coming to the last canal he took up the plank with haste. "Now\r\nwe can stop and breathe," he said; "that dog of a constable will have to\r\ngo two leagues and more to reach Your Excellency. Why, you\'re quite\r\npale," he said to Fabrizio; "I haven\'t forgotten the little bottle of\r\nbrandy."\r\n\r\n"It comes in most useful; the wound in my thigh is beginning to hurt me;\r\nand besides, I was in a fine fright in the police office by the bridge."\r\n\r\n"I can well believe it," said Lodovico; "with a shirt covered in blood,\r\nas yours was, I can\'t conceive how you ever even dared to set foot in\r\nsuch a place. As for your wounds, I know what to do; I am going to put\r\nyou in a cool place where you can sleep for an hour; the boat will come\r\nfor us there, if there is any way of getting a boat; if not, when you\r\nhave rested a little, we shall go on two short leagues, and I shall take\r\nyou to a mill where I shall take a boat myself. Your Excellency knows\r\nfar more than I do: the Signora will be in despair when she hears of the\r\naccident; they will tell her that you are mortally wounded, perhaps even\r\nthat you killed the other man by foul play. The Marchesa Raversi will\r\nnot fail to circulate all the evil reports that can hurt the Signora.\r\nYour Excellency might write."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE PO_\r\n\r\n\r\n"And how should I get the letter delivered?"\r\n\r\n"The boys at the mill where we are going earn twelve soldi a day; in a\r\nday and a half they can be at Parma, say four francs for the journey,\r\ntwo francs for the wear and tear of their shoe-leather: if the errand\r\nwas being done for a poor man like me, that would be six francs; as it\r\nis in the service of a Signore, I shall give them twelve."\r\n\r\nWhen they had reached the resting-place in a clump of alders and\r\nwillows, very leafy and very cool, Lodovico went to a house more than an\r\nhour\'s journey away in search of ink and paper. "Great heavens, how\r\ncomfortable I am here," cried Fabrizio. "Fortune, farewell! I shall\r\nnever be an Archbishop!"\r\n\r\nOn his return, Lodovico found him fast asleep and did not like to arouse\r\nhim. The boat did not arrive until the sun had almost set; as soon as\r\nLodovico saw it appear in the distance he called Fabrizio, who wrote a\r\ncouple of letters.\r\n\r\n"Your Excellency knows far more than I do," said Lodovico with a\r\ntroubled air, "and I am very much afraid of displeasing him seriously,\r\nwhatever he may say, if I add a certain remark."\r\n\r\n"I am not such a fool as you think me," replied Fabrizio, "and, whatever\r\nyou may say, you will always be in my eyes a faithful servant of my\r\naunt, and a man who has done everything in the world to get me out of a\r\nvery awkward scrape."\r\n\r\nMany more protestations still were required before Lodovico could be\r\nprevailed upon to speak, and when, at last he had made up his mind, he\r\nbegan with a preamble which lasted for quite five minutes. Fabrizio grew\r\nimpatient, then said to himself: "After all, whose fault is it? It is\r\ndue to our vanity, which this man has very well observed from his seat\r\non the box." Lodovico\'s devotion at last impelled him to run the risk of\r\nspeaking plainly.\r\n\r\n"What would not the Marchesa Raversi give to the messenger you are going\r\nto send to Parma to have these two letters? They are in your\r\nhandwriting, and consequently furnish legal evidence against you. Your\r\nExcellency will take me for an inquisitive and indiscreet fellow; in the\r\nsecond place, he will perhaps feel ashamed of setting before the eyes of\r\nthe Signora Duchessa the wretched handwriting of a coachman like myself;\r\nbut after all, the thought of your safety opens my mouth, although you\r\nmay think me impertinent. Could not Your Excellency dictate those two\r\nletters to me? Then I am the only person compromised, and that very\r\nlittle; I can say, at a pinch, that you appeared to me in the middle of\r\na field with an inkhorn in one hand and a pistol in the other, and that\r\nyou ordered me to write."\r\n\r\n"Give me your hand, my dear Lodovico," cried Fabrizio, "and to prove to\r\nyou that I wish to have no secret from a friend like yourself, copy\r\nthese two letters just as they are." Lodovico fully appreciated this\r\nmark of confidence, and was extremely grateful for it, but after writing\r\na few lines, as he saw the boat coming rapidly downstream:\r\n\r\n"The letters will be finished sooner," he said to Fabrizio, "if Your\r\nExcellency will take the trouble to dictate them to me." The letters\r\nwritten, Fabrizio wrote an A and a B on the closing lines, and on a\r\nlittle scrap of paper which he afterwards crumpled up, put in French:\r\n"_Croyez A et B_." The messenger would be told to hide this scrap of\r\npaper in his clothing.\r\n\r\nThe boat having come within hailing distance, Lodovico called to the\r\nboatmen by names which were not theirs; they made no reply, and put into\r\nthe bank a thousand yards lower down, looking all round them to make\r\nsure that they had not been seen by some _doganiere_.\r\n\r\n"I am at your orders," said Lodovico to Fabrizio; "would you like me to\r\ntake these letters myself to Parma? Or would you prefer me to accompany\r\nyou to Ferrara?"\r\n\r\n"To accompany me to Ferrara is a service which I was hardly daring to\r\nask of you. I shall have to land, and try to enter the town without\r\nshewing my passport. I may tell you that I feel the greatest repugnance\r\ntowards travelling under the name of Giletti, and I can think of no one\r\nbut yourself who would be able to buy me another passport."\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you speak at Casalmaggiore? I know a spy there who would\r\nhave sold me an excellent passport, and not dear, for forty or fifty\r\nfrancs."\r\n\r\nOne of the two boatmen, whose home was on the right bank of the Po, and\r\nwho consequently had no need of a foreign passport to go to Parma,\r\nundertook to deliver the letters. Lodovico, who knew how to handle the\r\noars, set to work to propel the boat with the other man.\r\n\r\n"We shall find on the lower reaches of the Po," he said, "several armed\r\nvessels belonging to the police, and I shall manage to avoid them." Ten\r\ntimes at least they were obliged to hide among little islets flush with\r\nthe water, covered with willows. Three times they set foot on shore in\r\norder to let the boat drift past the police vessels empty. Lodovico took\r\nadvantage of these long intervals of leisure to recite to Fabrizio\r\nseveral of his sonnets. The sentiments were true enough, but were so to\r\nspeak blunted by his expression of them, and were not worth the trouble\r\nof putting them on paper; the curious thing was that this ex-coachman\r\nhad passions and points of view that were vivid and picturesque; he\r\nbecame cold and commonplace as soon as he began to write. "It is the\r\nopposite of what we see in society," thought Fabrizio; "people know\r\nnowadays how to express everything gracefully, but their hearts have\r\nnothing to say." He realised that the greatest pleasure he could give to\r\nthis faithful servant would be to correct the mistakes in spelling in\r\nhis sonnets.\r\n\r\n"They laugh at me when I lend them my copy-book," said Lodovico; "but if\r\nYour Excellency would deign to dictate to me the spelling of the words\r\nletter by letter, the envious fellows wouldn\'t have anything left to\r\nsay: spelling doesn\'t make genius." It was not until the third night of\r\nhis journey that Fabrizio was able to land in complete safety in a\r\nthicket of alders, a league above Pontelagoscuro. All the next day he\r\nremained hidden in a hempfield, while Lodovico went ahead to Ferrara; he\r\nthere took some humble lodgings in the house of a poor Jew, who at once\r\nrealised that there was money to be earned if one knew how to keep one\'s\r\nmouth shut. That evening, as the light began to fail, Fabrizio entered\r\nFerrara riding upon a pony; he had every need of this support, for he\r\nhad been touched by the sun on the river; the knife-wound that he had in\r\nhis thigh, and the sword-thrust that Giletti had given him in the\r\nshoulder, at the beginning of their duel, were inflamed and had brought\r\non a fever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Jew, the owner of the house, had procured a discreet surgeon, who,\r\nrealising in his turn that there was money in the case, informed\r\nLodovico that his _conscience_ obliged him to make his report to the\r\npolice on the injuries of the young man whom he, Lodovico, called his\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n"The law is clear on the subject," he added; "it is evident that your\r\nbrother cannot possibly have injured himself, as he says, by falling\r\nfrom a ladder while he was holding an open knife in his hand."\r\n\r\nLodovico replied coldly to this honest surgeon that, if he should decide\r\nto yield to the inspirations of his conscience, he, Lodovico, would have\r\nthe honour, before leaving Ferrara, of falling upon him in precisely the\r\nsame way, with an open knife in his hand. When he reported this incident\r\nto Fabrizio, the latter blamed him strongly, but there was not a moment\r\nto be lost; they must fly. Lodovico told the Jew that he wished to try\r\nthe effect of a little fresh air on his brother; he went to fetch a\r\ncarriage, and our friends left the house never to return. The reader is\r\nno doubt finding these accounts of all the man\xc5\x93uvres that the absence\r\nof a passport renders necessary extremely wearisome; this sort of\r\nanxiety does not exist in France; but in Italy, and especially in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Po, people talk about passports all day long. Once\r\nthey had left Ferrara without hindrance, as though they were taking a\r\ndrive, Lodovico sent the carriage back, then re-entered the town by\r\nanother gate and returned to pick up Fabrizio with a _sediola_ which he\r\nhad hired to take them a dozen leagues. Coming near Bologna, our friends\r\nhad themselves taken through the fields to the road which leads from\r\nFlorence to Bologna; they spent the night in the most wretched inn they\r\ncould find, and on the following day, Fabrizio feeling strong enough to\r\nwalk a little, they entered Bologna like ordinary pedestrians. They had\r\nburned Giletti\'s passport; the comedian\'s death must by now be common\r\nknowledge, and there was less danger in being arrested as people without\r\npassports than as bearing the passport of a man who had been killed.\r\n\r\nLodovico knew at Bologna two or three servants in great houses; it was\r\ndecided that he should go to them and find out how the land lay. He\r\nexplained to them that, while he was on his way from Florence,\r\ntravelling with his younger brother, the latter, wanting to sleep, had\r\nlet him come on by himself an hour before sunrise. He was to have joined\r\nhim in the village where he, Lodovico, would stop to escape the midday\r\nheat. But Lodovico, seeing no sign of his brother, had decided to\r\nretrace his steps; he had found his brother injured by a blow from a\r\nstone and with several knife-wounds, and, in addition, robbed by some\r\nmen who had picked a quarrel with him. This brother was a good-looking\r\nboy, knew how to groom and drive horses, read and write, and was anxious\r\nto find a place with some good family. Lodovico reserved for use on a\r\nfuture occasion the detail that, when Fabrizio was on the ground, the\r\nrobbers had fled, taking with them the little bag in which the brothers\r\nhad put their linen and their passports.\r\n\r\nOn arriving in Bologna, Fabrizio, feeling extremely tired and not\r\nventuring, without a passport, to shew his face at an inn, had gone into\r\nthe huge church of San Petronio. He found there a delicious coolness;\r\npresently he felt quite revived. "Ungrateful wretch that I am," he said\r\nto himself suddenly, "I go into a church, simply to sit down, as it\r\nmight be in a _caff\xc3\xa8_!" He threw himself on his knees and thanked God\r\neffusively for the evident protection with which he had been surrounded\r\never since he had had the misfortune to kill Giletti. The danger which\r\nstill made him shudder had been that of his being recognised in the\r\npolice office at Casalmaggiore. "How," he asked himself, "did that\r\nclerk, whose eyes were so full of suspicion, who read my passport\r\nthrough at least three times, fail to notice that I am not five feet ten\r\ninches tall, that I am not thirty-eight years old, and that I am not\r\nstrongly pitted by small-pox? What thanks I owe to Thee, O my God! And I\r\nhave actually refrained until this moment from casting the nonentity\r\nthat I am at Thy feet. My pride has chosen to believe that it was to a\r\nvain human prudence that I owed the good fortune of escaping the\r\nSpielberg, which was already opening to engulf me."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_SAN PETRONIO_\r\n\r\n\r\nFabrizio spent more than an hour in this state of extreme emotion, in\r\nthe presence of the immense bounty of God. Lodovico approached, without\r\nhis hearing him, and took his stand opposite him. Fabrizio, who had\r\nburied his face in his hands, raised his head, and his faithful servant\r\ncould see the tears streaming down his cheeks.\r\n\r\n"Come back in an hour," Fabrizio ordered him, somewhat harshly.\r\n\r\nLodovico forgave this tone in view of the speaker\'s piety. Fabrizio\r\nrepeated several times the Seven Penitential Psalms, which he knew by\r\nheart; he stopped for a long time at the verses which had a bearing on\r\nhis situation at the moment.\r\n\r\nFabrizio asked pardon of God for many things, but what is really\r\nremarkable is that it never entered his head to number among his faults\r\nthe plan of becoming Archbishop simply because Conte Mosca was Prime\r\nMinister and felt that office and all the importance it implied to be\r\nsuitable for the Duchessa\'s nephew. He had desired it without passion,\r\nit is true, but still he had thought of it, exactly as one might think\r\nof being made a Minister or a General. It had never entered his thoughts\r\nthat his conscience might be concerned in this project of the Duchessa.\r\nThis is a remarkable characteristic of the religion which he owed to the\r\ninstruction given him by the Jesuits of Milan. That religion _deprives\r\none of the courage to think of unfamiliar things_, and especially\r\nforbids _personal examination_, as the most enormous of sins; it is a\r\nstep towards Protestantism. To find out of what sins one is guilty, one\r\nmust question one\'s priest, or read the list of sins, as it is to be\r\nfound printed in the books entitled, _Preparation for the Sacrament of\r\nPenance_. Fabrizio knew by heart the list of sins, rendered into the\r\nLatin tongue, which he had learned at the Ecclesiastical Academy of\r\nNaples. So, when going through that list, on coming to the article,\r\n_Murder_, he had most forcibly accused himself before God of having\r\nkilled a man, but in defence of his own life. He had passed rapidly, and\r\nwithout paying them the slightest attention, over the various articles\r\nrelating to the sin of _Simony_ (the procuring of ecclesiastical\r\ndignities with money). If anyone had suggested to him that he should pay\r\na hundred louis to become First Grand Vicar of the Archbishop of Parma,\r\nhe would have rejected such an idea with horror; but, albeit he was not\r\nwanting in intelligence, nor above all in logic, it never once occurred\r\nto his mind that the employment on his behalf of Conte Mosca\'s influence\r\nwas a form of Simony. This is where the Jesuitical education triumphs:\r\nit forms the habit of not paying attention to things that are clearer\r\nthan daylight. A Frenchman, brought up among conflicting personal\r\ninterests and in the prevailing irony of Paris might, without being\r\ndeliberately unfair, have accused Fabrizio of hypocrisy at the very\r\nmoment when our hero was opening his soul to God with the utmost\r\nsincerity and the most profound emotion.\r\n\r\nFabrizio did not leave the church until he had prepared the confession\r\nwhich he proposed to make next day. He found Lodovico sitting on the\r\nsteps of the vast stone peristyle which rises above the great piazza\r\nopposite the front of San Petronio. As after a storm the air becomes\r\nmore pure, so now Fabrizio\'s soul was tranquil and happy and so to speak\r\nrefreshed.\r\n\r\n"I feel quite well now, I hardly notice my wounds," he said to Lodovico\r\nas he approached him; "but first of all I have to apologise to you; I\r\nanswered you crossly when you came and spoke to me in the church; I was\r\nexamining my conscience. Well, how are things going?"\r\n\r\n"Excellently: I have taken lodgings, to tell the truth not at all worthy\r\nof Your Excellency, with the wife of one of my friends, who is a very\r\npretty woman and, better still, on the best of terms with one of the\r\nheads of the police. To-morrow I shall go to declare how our passports\r\ncame to be stolen; my declaration will be taken in good part; but I\r\nshall pay the carriage of the letter which the police will write to\r\nCasalmaggiore, to find out whether there exists in that _comune_ a\r\ncertain San Micheli, Lodovico, who has a brother, named Fabrizio, in\r\nservice with the Signora Duchessa Sanseverina at Parma. All is settled,\r\n_siamo a cavallo_." (An Italian proverb meaning: "We are saved.")\r\n\r\nFabrizio had suddenly assumed a most serious air: he begged Lodovico to\r\nwait a moment, almost ran back into the church, and when barely past the\r\ndoor flung himself down on his knees; he humbly kissed the stone slabs\r\nof the floor. "It is a miracle, Lord," he cried with tears in his eyes:\r\n"when Thou sawest my soul disposed to return to the path of duty, Thou\r\nhast saved me. Great God! It is possible that one day I may be killed in\r\nsome quarrel; in the hour of my death remember the state in which my\r\nsoul is now." It was with transports of the keenest joy that Fabrizio\r\nrecited afresh the Seven Penitential Psalms. Before leaving the building\r\nhe went up to an old woman who was seated before a great Madonna and by\r\nthe side of an iron triangle rising vertically from a stand of the same\r\nmetal. The sides of this triangle bristled with a large number of spikes\r\nintended to support the little candles which the piety of the faithful\r\nkeeps burning before the famous Madonna of Cimabue. Seven candles only\r\nwere lighted when Fabrizio approached the stand; he registered this fact\r\nin his memory, with the intention of meditating upon it later on when he\r\nhad more leisure.\r\n\r\n"What do the candles cost?" he asked the woman.\r\n\r\n"Two bajocchi each."\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact they were scarcely thicker than quills and were not\r\na foot in length.\r\n\r\n"How many candles can still go on your triangle?"\r\n\r\n"Sixty-three, since there are seven alight."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" thought Fabrizio, "sixty-three and seven make seventy; that also\r\nis to be borne in mind." He paid for the candles, placed the first seven\r\nin position himself, and lighted them, then fell on his knees to make\r\nhis oblation, and said to the old woman as he rose:\r\n\r\n"It is _for grace received_.\r\n\r\n"I am dying of hunger," he said to Lodovico as he joined him outside.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let us go to an _osteria_, let us go to our lodgings; the woman\r\nof the house will go out and buy you everything you want for your meal;\r\nshe will rob you of a score of soldi, and will be all the more attached\r\nto the newcomer in consequence."\r\n\r\n"All this means simply that I shall have to go on dying of hunger for a\r\ngood hour longer," said Fabrizio, laughing with the serenity of a child:\r\nand he entered an _osteria_ close to San Petronio. To his extreme\r\nsurprise, he saw at a table near the one at which he had taken his seat,\r\nPeppe, his aunt\'s first footman, the same who on a former occasion had\r\ncome to meet him at Geneva. Fabrizio made a sign to him to say nothing;\r\nthen, having made a hasty meal, a smile of happiness hovering over his\r\nlips, he rose; Peppe followed him, and, for the third time, our hero\r\nentered the church of San Petronio. Out of discretion, Lodovico remained\r\noutside, strolling in the _piazza_.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lord, Monsignore! How are your wounds? The Signora Duchessa is\r\nterribly upset: for a whole day she thought you were dead, and had been\r\nleft lying on some island in the Po; I must go and send off a messenger\r\nto her this very instant. I have been looking for you for the last six\r\ndays; I spent three at Ferrara, searching all the inns."\r\n\r\n"Have you a passport for me?"\r\n\r\n"I have three different ones: one with Your Excellency\'s names and\r\ntitles, a second with your name only, and the other in a false name,\r\nGiuseppe Bossi; each passport is made out in duplicate, according to\r\nwhether Your Excellency prefers to have come from Florence or from\r\nModena. You have only to go for a turn outside the town. The Signor\r\nConte would be glad if you would lodge at the Albergo del Pellegrino;\r\nthe landlord is a friend of his."\r\n\r\nFabrizio, with the air of a casual visitor, advanced along the right\r\naisle of the church to the place where his candles were burning; he\r\nfastened his eyes on Cimabue\'s Madonna, then said to Peppe as he fell on\r\nhis knees: "I must just give thanks for a moment." Peppe followed his\r\nexample. When they left the church, Peppe noticed that Fabrizio gave a\r\ntwenty-franc piece to the first pauper who asked him for alms: this\r\nmendicant uttered cries of gratitude which drew into the wake of the\r\ncharitable stranger the swarms of paupers of every kind who generally\r\nadorn the Piazza San Petronio. All of them were anxious to have a share\r\nin the napoleon. The women, despairing of making their way through the\r\ncrowd that surrounded him, flung themselves on Fabrizio, shouting to him\r\nto know whether it was not the fact that he had intended to give his\r\nnapoleon to be divided among all the _poveri del buon Dio_. Peppe,\r\nbrandishing his gold-headed cane, ordered them to leave His Excellency\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n"Oh! Excellency!" all the women proceeded to cry in still more piercing\r\naccents, "give another gold napoleon for the poor women!" Fabrizio\r\nincreased his pace, the women followed him, screaming, and a number of\r\nmale paupers, running in from every street, created a sort of tumult.\r\nAll this crowd, horribly dirty and energetic, cried out: "_Eccellenza_!"\r\nFabrizio had great difficulty in escaping from the rabble; the scene\r\nbrought his imagination back to earth. "I have got only what I deserve,"\r\nhe said to himself; "I have rubbed shoulders with the mob."\r\n\r\nTwo women followed him as far as the Porta Saragozza, by which he left\r\nthe town: Peppe stopped them by threatening them seriously with his cane\r\nand flinging them some small change; Fabrizio climbed the charming hill\r\nof San Michele in Bosco, made a partial circuit of the town outside the\r\nwalls, took a path which brought him in five hundred yards to the\r\nFlorence road, then re-entered Bologna and gravely handed to the police\r\nofficial a passport in which his description was given in the fullest\r\ndetail. This passport gave him the name of Giuseppe Bossi, student of\r\ntheology. Fabrizio noticed a little spot of red ink dropped, as though\r\nby accident, at the foot of the sheet, near the right hand corner. A\r\ncouple of hours later he had a spy on his heels, on account of the title\r\nof _Eccellenza_ which his companion had given him in front of the\r\nbeggars of San Petronio, although his passport bore none of the titles\r\nwhich give a man the right to make his servants address him as\r\nExcellency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE INQUIRY_\r\n\r\n\r\nFabrizio saw the spy and made light of him; he gave no more thought\r\neither to passports or to police, and amused himself with everything,\r\nlike a boy. Peppe, who had orders to stay beside him, seeing that he was\r\nmore than satisfied with Lodovico, preferred to go back in person to\r\nconvey these good tidings to the Duchessa. Fabrizio wrote two very long\r\nletters to his dear friends; then it occurred to him to write a third to\r\nthe venerable Archbishop Landriani. This letter produced a marvellous\r\neffect; it contained a very exact account of the affair with Giletti.\r\nThe good Archbishop, deeply moved, did not fail to go and read this\r\nletter to the Prince, who was quite ready to listen to it, being\r\nsomewhat curious to know what line this young Monsignore took to excuse\r\nso shocking a murder. Thanks to the many friends of the Marchesa\r\nRaversi, the Prince, as well as the whole city of Parma, believed that\r\nFabrizio had procured the assistance of twenty or thirty peasants to\r\noverpower a bad actor who had had the insolence to challenge him for the\r\nfavours of little Marietta. In despotic courts, the first skilful\r\nintriguer controls the _Truth_, as the fashion controls it in Paris.\r\n\r\n"But, what in the devil\'s name!" exclaimed the Prince to the Archbishop;\r\n"one gets things of that sort done for one by somebody else; but to do\r\nthem oneself is not the custom; besides, one doesn\'t kill a comedian\r\nlike Giletti, one buys him."\r\n\r\nFabrizio had not the slightest suspicion of what was going on at Parma.\r\nAs a matter of fact, the question there was whether the death of this\r\ncomedian, who in his lifetime had earned a monthly salary of thirty-two\r\nfrancs, was not going to bring about the fall of the Ultra Ministry, and\r\nof its leader, Conte Mosca.\r\n\r\nOn learning of the death of Giletti, the Prince, stung by the\r\nindependent airs which the Duchessa was giving herself, had ordered the\r\nFiscal General Rassi to treat the whole case as though the person\r\ncharged were a Liberal. Fabrizio, for his part, thought that a man of\r\nhis rank was superior to the laws; he did not take into account that in\r\ncountries where bearers of great names are never punished, intrigue can\r\ndo anything, even against them. He often spoke to Lodovico of his\r\nperfect innocence, which would very soon be proclaimed; his great\r\nargument being that he was not guilty. Whereupon Lodovico said to him:\r\n"I cannot conceive how Your Excellency, who has so much intelligence and\r\neducation, can take the trouble to say all that before me who am his\r\ndevoted servant; Your Excellency adopts too many precautions; that sort\r\nof thing is all right to say in public, or before a court." "This man\r\nbelieves me to be a murderer, and loves me none the less for it,"\r\nthought Fabrizio, falling from the clouds.\r\n\r\nThree days after Peppe\'s departure, he was greatly astonished to receive\r\nan enormous letter, sealed with a plait of silk, as in the days of Louis\r\nXIV, and addressed _a Sua Eccellenza reverendissima monsignor Fabrizio\r\ndel Dongo, primo gran vicario della diocesi di Parma, canonico_, etc.\r\n\r\n"Why, am I still all that?" he asked himself with a laugh. Archbishop\r\nLandriani\'s letter was a masterpiece of logic and lucidity; it filled\r\nnevertheless nineteen large pages, and gave an extremely good account of\r\nall that had occurred in Parma on the occasion of the death of Giletti.\r\n\r\n"A French army commanded by Marshal Ney, and marching upon the town,\r\nwould not have had a greater effect," the good Archbishop informed him;\r\n"with the exception of the Duchessa and myself, my dearly beloved son,\r\neveryone believes that you gave yourself the pleasure of killing the\r\nhistrion Giletti. Had this misfortune befallen you, it is one of those\r\nthings which one hushes up with two hundred louis and six months\'\r\nabsence abroad; but the Marchesa Raversi is seeking to overthrow Conte\r\nMosca with the help of this incident. It is not at all with the dreadful\r\nsin of murder that the public blames you, it is solely with the\r\n_clumsiness_, or rather the insolence of not having condescended to have\r\nrecourse to a _bulo_" (a sort of hired assassin). "I give you a summary\r\nhere in clear terms of the things that I hear said all around me, for\r\nsince this ever deplorable misfortune, I go every day to three of the\r\nprincipal houses in the town to have an opportunity of justifying you.\r\nAnd never have I felt that I was making a more blessed use of the scanty\r\neloquence with which heaven has deigned to endow me."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE ARCHBISHOP_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scales fell from Fabrizio\'s eyes; the Duchessa\'s many letters,\r\nfilled with transports of affection, never condescended to tell him\r\nanything. The Duchessa swore to him that she would leave Parma for ever,\r\nunless presently he returned there in triumph. "The Conte will do for\r\nyou," she wrote to him in the letter that accompanied the Archbishop\'s,\r\n"everything that is humanly possible. As for myself, you have changed my\r\ncharacter with this fine escapade of yours; I am now as great a miser as\r\nthe banker Tombone; I have dismissed all my workmen, I have done more, I\r\nhave dictated to the Conte the inventory of my fortune, which turns out\r\nto be far less considerable than I supposed. After the death of the\r\nexcellent Conte Pietranera, whom, by the way, you would have done far\r\nbetter to avenge, instead of exposing your life to a creature of\r\nGiletti\'s sort, I was left with an income of twelve hundred francs and\r\nfive thousand francs of debts; I remember, among other things, that I\r\nhad two and a half dozen white satin slippers coming from Paris and not\r\na single pair of shoes to wear in the street. I have almost made up my\r\nmind to take the three hundred thousand francs which the Duca has left\r\nme, the whole of which I intended to use in erecting a magnificent tomb\r\nto him. Besides, it is the Marchesa Raversi who is your principal enemy,\r\nthat is to say mine; if you find life dull by yourself at Bologna, you\r\nhave only to say the word, I shall come and join you. Here are four more\r\nbills of exchange," and so on.\r\n\r\nThe Duchessa said not a word to Fabrizio of the opinion that was held in\r\nParma of his affair, she wished above all things to comfort him, and in\r\nany event the death of a ridiculous creature like Giletti did not seem\r\nto her the sort of thing that could be seriously charged against a del\r\nDongo. "How many Gilettis have not our ancestors sent into the other\r\nworld," she said to the Conte, "without anyone\'s ever taking it into his\r\nhead to reproach them with it?"\r\n\r\nFabrizio, taken completely by surprise, and getting for the first time a\r\nglimpse of the true state of things, set himself down to study the\r\nArchbishop\'s letter. Unfortunately the Archbishop himself believed him\r\nto be better informed than he actually was. Fabrizio gathered that the\r\nprincipal cause of the Marchesa Raversi\'s triumph lay in the fact that\r\nit was impossible to find any eye-witnesses of the fatal combat. The\r\nfootman who had been the first to bring the news to Parma had been at\r\nthe village inn at Sanguigna when the fight occurred; little Marietta\r\nand the old woman who acted as her mother had vanished, and the Marchesa\r\nhad bought the _vetturino_ who drove the carriage, and who had now made\r\nan abominable deposition. "Although the proceedings are enveloped in the\r\nmost profound mystery," wrote the Archbishop in his Ciceronian style,\r\n"and directed by the Fiscal General, Rassi, of whom Christian charity\r\nalone can restrain me from speaking evil, but who has made his fortune\r\nby harrying his wretched prisoners as the greyhound harries the hare;\r\nalthough this Rassi, I say, whose turpitude and venality your\r\nimagination would be powerless to exaggerate, has been appointed to take\r\ncharge of the case by an angry Prince, I have been able to read the\r\nthree depositions of the _vetturino_. By a signal piece of good fortune,\r\nthe wretch contradicts himself. And I shall add, since I am addressing\r\nmy Grand Vicar, him who, after myself, is to have the charge of this\r\nDiocese, that I have sent for the curate of the parish in which this\r\nstraying sinner resides. I shall tell you, my dearly beloved son, but\r\nunder the seal of the confessional, that this curate already knows,\r\nthrough the wife of the _vetturino_, the number of scudi that he has\r\nreceived from the Marchesa Raversi; I shall not venture to say that the\r\nMarchesa insisted upon his slandering you, but that is probable. The\r\nscudi were transmitted to him through a wretched priest who performs\r\nfunctions of a base order in the Marchesa\'s household, and whom I have\r\nbeen obliged to banish from the altar for the second time. I shall not\r\nweary you with an account of various other actions which you might\r\nexpect from me, and which, moreover, enter into my duty. A Canon, your\r\ncolleague at the Cathedral, who is a little too prone at times to\r\nremember the influence conferred upon him by the wealth of his family,\r\nto which, by divine permission, he is now the sole heir, having allowed\r\nhimself to say in the house of Conte Zurla, the Minister of the\r\nInterior, that he regarded this _bagattella_ (he referred to the killing\r\nof the unfortunate Giletti) as proved against you, I summoned him to\r\nappear before me, and there, in the presence of my three other Vicars\r\nGeneral, of my Chaplain and of two curates who happened to be in the\r\nwaiting-room, I requested him to communicate to us his brethren the\r\nelements of the complete conviction which he professed to have acquired\r\nagainst one of his colleagues at the Cathedral; the unhappy man was able\r\nto articulate only the most inconclusive arguments; every voice was\r\nraised against him, and, although I did not think it my duty to add more\r\nthan a very few words, he burst into tears and made us the witnesses of\r\nhis full confession of his complete error, upon which I promised him\r\nsecrecy in my name and in the names of the persons who had been present\r\nat the discussion, always on the condition that he would devote all his\r\nzeal to correcting the false impressions that might have been created by\r\nthe language employed by him during the previous fortnight.\r\n\r\n"I shall not repeat to you, my dear son, what you must long have known,\r\nnamely that of the thirty-four _contadini_ employed on the excavations\r\nundertaken by Conte Mosca, whom the Raversi pretends to have been paid\r\nby you to assist you in a crime, thirty-two were at the bottom of their\r\ntrench, wholly taken up with their work, when you armed yourself with\r\nthe hunting knife and employed it to defend your life against the man\r\nwho had attacked you thus unawares. Two of their number, who were\r\noutside the trench, shouted to the others: \'They are murdering\r\nMonsignore!\' This cry alone reveals your innocence in all its whiteness.\r\nVery well, the Fiscal General Rassi maintains that these two men have\r\ndisappeared; furthermore, they have found eight of the men who were at\r\nthe bottom of the trench; at their first examination, six declared that\r\nthey had heard the cry: \'They are murdering Monsignore!\' I know, through\r\nindirect channels, that at their fifth examination, which was held\r\nyesterday evening, five declared that they could not remember distinctly\r\nwhether they had heard the cry themselves or whether it had been\r\nreported to them by their comrades. Orders have been given that I am to\r\nbe informed of the place of residence of these excavators, and their\r\nparish priests will make them understand that they are damning\r\nthemselves if, in order to gain a few soldi, they allow themselves to\r\nalter the truth."\r\n\r\nThe good Archbishop went into endless details, as may be judged by those\r\nwe have extracted from his letter. Then he added, using the Latin\r\ntongue:\r\n\r\n"This affair is nothing less than an attempt to bring about a change of\r\ngovernment. If you are sentenced, it can be only to the galleys or to\r\ndeath, in which case I should intervene by declaring from my\r\nArchepiscopal Throne that I know you to be innocent, that you simply\r\nand solely defended your life against a brigand, and that finally I have\r\nforbidden you to return to Parma for so long as your enemies shall be\r\ntriumphant there; I propose even to stigmatise, as he deserves, the\r\nFiscal General; the hatred felt for that man is as common as esteem for\r\nhis character is rare. But finally, on the eve of the day on which this\r\nFiscal is to pronounce so unjust a sentence, the Duchessa Sanseverina\r\nwill leave the town, and perhaps even the States of Parma: in that\r\nevent, no doubt is felt that the Conte will hand in his resignation.\r\nThen, very probably, General Fabio Conti will come into office and the\r\nMarchesa Raversi will be triumphant. The great mistake in your case is\r\nthat no skilled person has been appointed to take charge of the\r\nprocedure necessary to bring your innocence into the light of day, and\r\nto foil the attempts that have been made to suborn witnesses. The Conte\r\nbelieves that he is playing this part; but he is too great a gentleman\r\nto stoop to certain details; besides, in his capacity as Minister of\r\nPolice, he was obliged to issue, at the first moment, the most severe\r\norders against you. Lastly, dare I say it, our Sovereign Lord believes\r\nyou to be guilty, or at least feigns that belief, and has introduced a\r\ncertain bitterness into the affair." (The words corresponding to "our\r\nSovereign Lord" and "feigns that belief" were in Greek, and Fabrizio\r\nfelt infinitely obliged to the Archbishop for having had the courage to\r\nwrite them. With a pen-knife he cut this line out of the letter, and\r\ndestroyed it on the spot.)\r\n\r\nFabrizio broke off a score of times while reading this letter; he was\r\ncarried away by transports of the liveliest gratitude: he replied at\r\nonce in a letter of eight pages. Often he was obliged to raise his head\r\nso that his tears should not fall on the paper. Next day, as he was\r\nsealing this letter, he felt that it was too worldly in tone. "I shall\r\nwrite it in Latin," he said to himself, "that will make it appear more\r\nseemly to the worthy Archbishop." But, while he was seeking to construct\r\nfine Latin phrases of great length, in the true Ciceronian style, he\r\nremembered that one day the Archbishop, in speaking to him of Napoleon,\r\nhad made a point of calling him Buonaparte; at that instant there\r\nvanished all the emotion that, on the previous day, had moved him to\r\ntears. "O King of Italy!" he exclaimed, "that loyalty which so many\r\nothers swore to thee in thy lifetime, I shall preserve for thee after\r\nthy death. He is fond of me, no doubt, but because I am a del Dongo and\r\nhe a son of the people." So that his fine letter in Italian might not be\r\nwasted, Fabrizio made a few necessary alterations in it, and addressed\r\nit to Conte Mosca.\r\n\r\nThat same day, Fabrizio met in the street little Marietta; she flushed\r\nwith joy and made a sign to him to follow her without speaking. She made\r\nswiftly for a deserted archway; there, she pulled forward the black lace\r\nshawl which, following the local custom, covered her head, so that she\r\ncould not be recognised; then turning round quickly:\r\n\r\n"How is it," she said to Fabrizio, "that you are walking freely in the\r\nstreet like this?" Fabrizio told her his story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_MARIETTA_\r\n\r\n\r\n"Good God! You were at Ferrara! And there was I looking for everywhere\r\nin the place! You must know that I quarrelled with the old woman,\r\nbecause she wanted to take me to Venice, where I knew quite well that\r\nyou would never go, because you are on the Austrian black list. I sold\r\nmy gold necklace to come to Bologna, I had a presentiment that I should\r\nhave the happiness of meeting you here; the old woman arrived two days\r\nafter me. And so I shan\'t ask you to come and see us, she would go on\r\nmaking those dreadful demands for money which make me so ashamed. We\r\nhave lived very comfortably since the fatal day you remember, and\r\nhaven\'t spent a quarter of what you gave us. I would rather not come and\r\nsee you at the Albergo del Pellegrino, it would be a _pubblicit\xc3\xa0_. Try\r\nto find a little room in a quiet street, and at the Ave Maria"\r\n(nightfall) "I shall be here, under this same archway." So saying, she\r\ntook to her heels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nAll serious thoughts were forgotten on the unexpected appearance of this\r\ncharming person. Fabrizio settled himself to live at Bologna in a joy\r\nand security that were profound. This artless tendency to take delight\r\nin everything that entered into his life shewed through in the letters\r\nwhich he wrote to the Duchessa; to such an extent that she began to take\r\noffence. Fabrizio paid little attention; he wrote, however, in abridged\r\nsymbols on the face of his watch: "When I write to the D., must never\r\nsay _When I was prelate, when I was in the Church_: that annoys her." He\r\nhad bought a pair of ponies with which he was greatly pleased: he used\r\nto harness them to a hired carriage whenever little Marietta wished to\r\npay a visit to any of the enchanting spots in the neighbourhood of\r\nBologna; almost every evening he drove her to the _Cascata del Reno_. On\r\ntheir way back, he would call on the friendly Crescentini, who regarded\r\nhimself as to some extent Marietta\'s father.\r\n\r\n"Upon my soul, if this is the _caff\xc3\xa8_ life which seemed to me so\r\nridiculous for a man of any worth, I did wrong to reject it," Fabrizio\r\nsaid to himself. He forgot that he never went near a _caff\xc3\xa8_ except to\r\nread the _Constitutionnel_, and that, since he was a complete stranger\r\nto everyone in Bologna, the gratification of vanity did not enter at all\r\ninto his present happiness. When he was not with little Marietta, he was\r\nto be seen at the Observatory, where he was taking a course in\r\nastronomy; the Professor had formed a great affection for him, and\r\nFabrizio used to lend him his ponies on Sundays, to cut a figure with\r\nhis wife on the _Corso della Montagnola_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE MAMMACCIA_\r\n\r\n\r\nHe loathed the idea of harming any living creature, however undeserving\r\nthat creature might be. Marietta was resolutely opposed to his seeing\r\nthe old woman, but one day, when she was at church, he went up to visit\r\nthe _Mammaccia_, who flushed with anger when she saw him enter the room.\r\n"This is a case where one plays the del Dongo," he said to himself.\r\n\r\n"How much does Marietta earn in a month when she is working?" he cried,\r\nwith the air with which a self-respecting young man, in Paris, enters\r\nthe balcony at the Bouffes.\r\n\r\n"Fifty scudi."\r\n\r\n"You are lying, as usual; tell the truth, or, by God, you shall not have\r\na centesimo!"\r\n\r\n"Very well, she was getting twenty-two scudi in our company at Parma,\r\nwhen we had the bad luck to meet you; I was getting twelve scudi, and we\r\nused to give Giletti, our protector, a third of what each of us earned.\r\nOut of which, every month almost, Giletti would make Marietta a present;\r\nthe present might be worth a couple of scudi."\r\n\r\n"You\'re lying still; you never had more than four scudi. But if you are\r\ngood to Marietta, I will engage you as though I were an _impresario_;\r\nevery month you shall have twelve scudi for yourself and twenty-two for\r\nher; but if I see her with red eyes, I make you bankrupt."\r\n\r\n"You\'re very stiff and proud; very well, your fine generosity will be\r\nthe ruin of us," replied the old woman in a furious tone; "we lose our\r\n_avviamento_" (our connexion). "When we have the enormous misfortune to\r\nbe deprived of Your Excellency\'s protection, we shall no longer be known\r\nin any of the companies, they will all be filled up; we shall not find\r\nany engagement, and, all through you, we shall starve to death."\r\n\r\n"Go to the devil," said Fabrizio as he left the room.\r\n\r\n"I shall not go to the devil, you impious wretch! But I will go straight\r\naway to the police office, where they shall learn from me that you are a\r\nMonsignore who has flung his cassock to the winds, and that you are no\r\nmore Giuseppe Bossi than I am." Fabrizio had already gone some way down\r\nthe stairs. He returned.\r\n\r\n"In the first place, the police know better than you what my real name\r\nmay be; but if you take it into your head to denounce me, if you do\r\nanything so infamous," he said to her with great seriousness, "Lodovico,\r\nshall talk to you, and it is not six slashes with the knife that your\r\nold carcass shall get, but two dozen, and you will be six months in\r\nhospital, and no tobacco."\r\n\r\nThe old woman turned pale, and dashed at Fabrizio\'s hand, which she\r\ntried to kiss.\r\n\r\n"I accept with gratitude the provision that you are making for Marietta\r\nand me. You look so good that I took you for a fool; and, you bear in\r\nmind, others besides myself may make the same error; I advise you always\r\nto adopt a more noblemanly air." Then she added with an admirable\r\nimpudence: "You will reflect upon this good advice, and, as the winter\r\nis not far off, you will make Marietta and me a present of two good\r\njackets of that fine English stuff which they sell at the big shop in\r\nthe Piazza San Petronio."\r\n\r\nThe love of the pretty Marietta offered Fabrizio all the charms of the\r\nmost delightful friendship, which set him dreaming of the happiness of\r\nthe same order which he might have been finding in the Duchessa\'s\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n"But is it not a very pleasant thing," he asked himself at times, "that\r\nI am not susceptible to that exclusive and passionate preoccupation\r\nwhich they call love? Among the intimacies into which chance has brought\r\nme at Novara or at Naples, have I ever met a woman whose company, even\r\nin the first few days, was to my mind preferable to riding a good horse\r\nthat I did not know? What they call love," he went on, "can that be just\r\nanother lie? I feel myself in love, no doubt, as I feel a good appetite\r\nat six o\'clock! Can it be out of this slightly vulgar propensity that\r\nthose liars have fashioned the love of Othello, the love of Tancred? Or\r\nam I indeed to suppose that I am constructed differently from other men?\r\nThat my soul should be lacking in one passion, why should that be? It\r\nwould be a singular destiny!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE DUCHESSA_\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Naples, especially in the latter part of his time there, Fabrizio had\r\nmet women who, proud of their rank, their beauty and the position held\r\nin society by the adorers whom they had sacrificed to him, had attempted\r\nto lead him. On discovering their intention, Fabrizio had broken with\r\nthem in the most summary and open fashion. "Well," he said to himself,\r\n"if I ever allow myself to be carried away by the pleasure, which no\r\ndoubt is extremely keen, of being on friendly terms with that charming\r\nwoman who is known as the Duchessa Sanseverina, I shall be exactly like\r\nthat stupid Frenchman who killed the goose that was laying the golden\r\neggs. It is to the Duchessa that I owe the sole happiness which has ever\r\ncome to me from sentiments of affection: my friendship for her is my\r\nlife, and besides, without her, what am I? A poor exile reduced to\r\nliving from hand to mouth in a tumble-down country house outside Novara.\r\nI remember how, during the heavy autumn rains, I used to be obliged, at\r\nnight, for fear of accidents, to fix up an umbrella over the tester of\r\nmy bed. I rode the agent\'s horses, which he was good enough to allow out\r\nof respect for my blue blood (for my influence, that is), but he was\r\nbeginning to find my stay there a trifle long; my father had made me an\r\nallowance of twelve hundred francs, and thought himself damned for\r\nhaving given bread to a Jacobin. My poor mother and sisters let\r\nthemselves go without new clothes to keep me in a position to make a few\r\nlittle presents to my mistresses. This way of being generous pierced me\r\nto the heart. And besides, people were beginning to suspect my poverty,\r\nand the young noblemen of the district would have been feeling sorry for\r\nme next. Sooner or later some prig would have let me see his contempt\r\nfor a poor Jacobin whose plans had come to grief, for in those people\'s\r\neyes I was nothing more than that. I should have given or received some\r\ndoughty thrust with a sword which would have carried me off to the\r\nfortress of Fenestrelle, or else I should have been obliged to take\r\nrefuge again in Switzerland, still on my allowance of twelve hundred\r\nfrancs. I have the good fortune to be indebted to the Duchessa for the\r\nabsence of all these evils; besides, it is she who feels for me the\r\ntransports of affection which I ought to be feeling for her.\r\n\r\n"Instead of that ridiculous, pettifogging existence which would have\r\nmade me a sad dog, a fool, for the last four years I have been living in\r\na big town, and have an excellent carriage, which things have preserved\r\nme from feelings of envy and all the base sentiments of a provincial\r\nlife. This too indulgent aunt is always scolding me because I do not\r\ndraw enough money from the banker. Do I wish to ruin for all time so\r\nadmirable a position? Do I wish to lose the one friend that I have in\r\nthe world? All I need do is to utter a _falsehood_; all I need do is to\r\nsay to a charming woman, a woman who is perhaps without a counterpart in\r\nthe world, and for whom I feel the most passionate friendship: \'_I love\r\nyou_,\' I who do not know what it is to love amorously. She would spend\r\nthe day finding fault with me for the absence of these transports which\r\nare unknown to me. Marietta, on the other hand, who does not see into my\r\nheart, and takes a caress for a transport of the soul, thinks me madly\r\nin love and looks upon herself as the most fortunate of women.\r\n\r\n"As a matter of fact, the only slight acquaintance I have ever had with\r\nthat tender obsession which is called, I believe, _love_, was with that\r\nyoung Aniken in the inn at Zonders, near the Belgian frontier."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_FAUSTA_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is with regret that we have to record here one of Fabrizio\'s worst\r\nactions; in the midst of this tranquil life, a wretched _pique_ of\r\nvanity took possession of this heart rebellious to love and led it far\r\nastray. Simultaneously with himself there happened to be at Bologna the\r\nfamous Fausta F----, unquestionably one of the finest singers of the day\r\nand perhaps the most capricious woman that was ever seen. The excellent\r\npoet Burati, of Venice, had composed the famous satirical sonnet about\r\nher, which at that time was to be heard on the lips alike of princes and\r\nof the meanest street Arabs:\r\n\r\n\r\n"To wish and not to wish, to adore and on the same day to detest, to\r\nfind contentment only in inconstancy, to scorn what the world worships,\r\nwhile the world worships it: Fausta has these defects and many more.\r\nLook not therefore upon that serpent. If thou seest her, imprudent man,\r\nthou forgettest her caprices. Hast thou the happiness to hear her voice,\r\nthou dost forget thyself, and love makes of thee, in a moment, what\r\nCirce in days of yore made of the companions of Ulysses."\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the moment, this miracle of beauty had come under the spell of the\r\nenormous whiskers and haughty insolence of the young Conte M-----, to\r\nsuch an extent as not to be revolted by his abominable jealousy.\r\nFabrizio saw this Conte in the streets of Bologna and was shocked by the\r\nair of superiority with which he took up the pavement and deigned to\r\ndisplay his graces to the public. This young man was extremely rich,\r\nimagined that everything was permitted him, and, as his _prepotenze_ had\r\nbrought him threats of punishment, never appeared in public save with\r\nthe escort of nine or ten _buli_ (a sort of cut-throat) clad in his\r\nlivery, whom he had brought from his estates in the environs of Brescia.\r\nFabrizio\'s eye had met once or twice that of this terrible Conte, when\r\nchance led him to hear Fausta sing. He was astonished by the angelic\r\nsweetness of her voice: he had never imagined anything like it; he was\r\nindebted to it for sensations of supreme happiness, which made a\r\npleasing contrast to the _placidity_ of his life at the time. Could this\r\nat last be love? he asked himself. Thoroughly curious to taste that\r\nsentiment, and amused moreover by the thought of braving Conte M----,\r\nwhose expression was more terrifying than that of any drum-major, our\r\nhero let himself fall into the childish habit of passing a great deal\r\ntoo often in front of the _palazzo_ Tanari, which Conte M---- had taken\r\nfor Fausta.\r\n\r\nOne day, as night was beginning to fall, Fabrizio, seeking to catch\r\nFausta\'s eye, was greeted by peals of laughter of the most pointed kind\r\nproceeding from the Conte\'s _buli_, who were assembled by the door of\r\nthe _palazzo_ Tanari. He hastened home, armed himself well, and again\r\npassed before the _palazzo_. Fausta, concealed behind her shutters, was\r\nawaiting his return, and gave him due credit for it. M----, jealous of\r\nthe whole world, became specially jealous of Signor Giuseppe Bossi, and\r\nindulged in ridiculous utterances; whereupon every morning our hero had\r\ndelivered at his door a letter which contained only these words:\r\n\r\n"Signor Giuseppe Bossi destroys troublesome insects and is staying at\r\nthe Pellegrino, Via Larga, No. 79."\r\n\r\nConte M----, accustomed to the respect which was everywhere assured him\r\nby his enormous fortune, his blue blood and the physical courage of his\r\nthirty servants, declined altogether to understand the language of this\r\nlittle missive.\r\n\r\nFabrizio wrote others of the sort to Fausta; M---- posted spies round\r\nthis rival, who perhaps was not unattractive; first of all, he learned\r\nhis true name, and later that, for the present, he could not shew his\r\nface at Parma. A few days after this, Conte M----, his _buli_, his\r\nmagnificent horses and Fausta set off together for Parma.\r\n\r\nFabrizio, becoming excited, followed them next day. In vain did the good\r\nLodovico utter pathetic remonstrances: Fabrizio turned a deaf ear, and\r\nLodovico, who was himself extremely brave, admired him for it; besides,\r\nthis removal brought him nearer to the pretty mistress he had left at\r\nCasalmaggiore. Through Lodovico\'s efforts, nine or ten old soldiers of\r\nNapoleon\'s regiments re-enlisted under Signor Giuseppe Bossi, in the\r\ncapacity of servants. "Provided," Fabrizio told himself, when committing\r\nthe folly of going after Fausta, "that I have no communication either\r\nwith the Minister of Police, Conte Mosca, or with the Duchessa, I expose\r\nonly myself to risk. I shall explain later on to my aunt that I was\r\ngoing in search of love, that beautiful thing which I have never\r\nencountered. The fact is that I think of Fausta even when I am not\r\nlooking at her. But is it the memory of her voice that I love, or her\r\nperson?" Having ceased to think of an ecclesiastical career, Fabrizio\r\nhad grown a pair of moustaches and whiskers almost as terrible as those\r\nof Conte M----, and these disguised him to some extent. He set up his\r\nheadquarters not at Parma--that would have been too imprudent--but in a\r\nneighbouring village, in the woods, on the road to Sacca, where his aunt\r\nhad her country house. Following Lodovico\'s advice, he gave himself out\r\nin this village as the valet of a great English nobleman of original\r\ntastes, who spent a hundred thousand francs a year on providing himself\r\nwith the pleasures of the chase, and would arrive shortly from the Lake\r\nof Como, where he was detained by the trout-fishing. Fortunately for\r\nhim, the charming little _palazzo_ which Conte M---- had taken for the\r\nfair Fausta was situated at the southern extremity of the city of Parma,\r\nprecisely on the road to Sacca, and Fausta\'s windows looked out over the\r\nfine avenues of tall trees which extend beneath the high tower of the\r\ncitadel. Fabrizio was completely unknown in this little frequented\r\nquarter; he did not fail to have Conte M---- followed, and one day when\r\nthat gentleman had just emerged from the admirable singer\'s door, he had\r\nthe audacity to appear in the street in broad daylight; it must be\r\nadmitted that he was mounted upon an excellent horse, and well armed. A\r\nparty of musicians, of the sort that frequent the streets in Italy and\r\nare sometimes excellent, came and planted their viols under Fausta\'s\r\nwindow; after playing a prelude they sang, and quite well too, a cantata\r\ncomposed in her honour. Fausta came to the window and had no difficulty\r\nin distinguishing a young man of extremely polite manners, who, stopping\r\nhis horse in the middle of the street, bowed to her first of all, then\r\nbegan to direct at her a gaze that could have but one meaning. In spite\r\nof the exaggeratedly English costume adopted by Fabrizio, she soon\r\nrecognised the author of the passionate letters that had brought about\r\nher departure from Bologna. "That is a curious creature," she said to\r\nherself; "it seems to me that I am going to fall in love with him. I\r\nhave a hundred louis in hand, I can quite well give that terrible Conte\r\nM---- the slip; if it comes to that, he has no spirit, he never does\r\nanything unexpected, and is only slightly amusing because of the\r\nbloodthirsty appearance of his escort."\r\n\r\nOn the following day Fabrizio, having learned that every morning at\r\neleven o\'clock Fausta went to hear mass in the centre of the town, in\r\nthat same church of San Giovanni which contained the tomb of his\r\ngreat-uncle, Archbishop Ascanio del Dongo, made bold to follow her\r\nthere. To tell the truth, Lodovico had procured him a fine English wig\r\nwith hair of the most becoming red. Inspired by the colour of his wig,\r\nwhich was that of the flames that were devouring his heart, he composed\r\na sonnet which Fausta thought charming; an unseen hand had taken care to\r\nplace it upon her piano. This little war lasted for quite a week; but\r\nFabrizio found that, in spite of the steps he was taking in every\r\ndirection, he was making no real progress; Fausta refused to see him. He\r\nstrained the effect of singularity; she admitted afterwards that she was\r\nafraid of him. Fabrizio was kept going now only by a faint hope of\r\ncoming to feel what is known as _love_, but frequently he felt bored.\r\n\r\n"Let us leave this place, Signore," Lodovico used to urge him; "you are\r\nnot in the least in love: I can see that you have the most desperate\r\ncoolness and commonsense. Besides, you are making no headway; if only\r\nfor shame, let us clear out." Fabrizio was ready to go at the first\r\nmoment of ill-humour, when he heard that Fausta was to sing at the\r\nDuchessa Sanseverina\'s. "Perhaps that sublime voice will succeed in\r\nsoftening my heart," he said to himself; and he actually ventured to\r\npenetrate in disguise into that _palazzo_ where he was known to every\r\neye. We may imagine the Duchessa\'s emotion, when right at the end of the\r\nconcert, she noticed a man in the full livery of a _chasseur_, standing\r\nby the door of the big drawing-room: that pose reminded her of someone.\r\nShe went to look for Conte Mosca, who only then informed her of the\r\nsignal and truly incredible folly of Fabrizio. He took it extremely\r\nwell. This love for another than the Duchessa pleased him greatly; the\r\nConte, a perfect _galantuomo_, apart from politics, acted upon the maxim\r\nthat he could himself find happiness only so long as the Duchessa was\r\nhappy. "I shall save him from himself," he said to his mistress; "judge\r\nof our enemies\' joy if he were arrested in this _palazzo_! Also I have\r\nmore than a hundred men with me here, and that is why I made them ask\r\nyou for the keys of the great reservoir. He gives out that he is madly\r\nin love with Fausta, and up to the present has failed to get her away\r\nfrom Conte M----, who lets the foolish woman live the life of a queen."\r\nThe Duchessa\'s features betrayed the keenest grief; so Fabrizio was\r\nnothing more than a libertine, utterly incapable of any tender and\r\nserious feeling. "And not to come and see us! That is what I shall never\r\nbe able to forgive him!" she said at length; "and I writing to him every\r\nday to Bologna!"\r\n\r\n"I greatly admire his restraint," replied the Conte; "he does not wish\r\nto compromise us by his escapade, and it will be amusing to hear him\r\ntell us about it."\r\n\r\nFausta was too great a fool to be able to keep quiet about what was on\r\nher mind; the day after the concert, every melody in which her eyes had\r\naddressed to that tall young man dressed as a _chasseur_, she spoke to\r\nConte M---- of an unknown admirer. "Where do you see him?" asked the\r\nConte in a fury. "In the streets, in church," replied Fausta, at a loss\r\nfor words. At once she sought to atone for her imprudence, or at least\r\nto eliminate from it anything that could suggest Fabrizio: she dashed\r\ninto an endless description of a tall young man with red hair; he had\r\nblue eyes; no doubt he was some Englishman, very rich and very awkward,\r\nor some prince. At this word Conte M----, who did not shine in the\r\naccuracy of his perceptions, conceived the idea, deliciously flattering\r\nto his vanity, that this rival was none other than the Crown Prince of\r\nParma. This poor melancholy young man, guarded by five or six governors,\r\nunder-governors, preceptors, etc., etc., who never allowed him out of\r\ndoors until they had first held council together, used to cast strange\r\nglances at all the passable women whom he was permitted to approach. At\r\nthe Duchessa\'s concert, his rank had placed him in front of all the rest\r\nof the audience in an isolated armchair within three yards of the fair\r\nFausta, and his stare had been supremely shocking to Conte M----. This\r\nhallucination of an exquisite vanity, that he had a Prince for a rival,\r\ngreatly amused Fausta, who took delight in confirming it with a hundred\r\ndetails artlessly supplied.\r\n\r\n"Your race," she asked the Conte, "is surely as old as that of the\r\nFarnese, to which this young man belongs?"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean? As old? I have no bastardy in my family, thank\r\nyou."[11]\r\n\r\nAs luck would have it, Conte M---- never had an opportunity of studying\r\nthis pretended rival at his leisure, which confirmed him in the\r\nflattering idea of his having a Prince for antagonist. The fact was that\r\nwhenever the interests of his enterprise did not summon Fabrizio to\r\nParma, he remained in the woods round Sacca and on the bank of the Po.\r\nConte M---- was indeed more proud, but was also more prudent since he\r\nhad imagined himself to be on the way to disputing the heart of Fausta\r\nwith a Prince; he begged her very seriously to observe the greatest\r\nrestraint in all her doings. After flinging himself on his knees like a\r\njealous and impassioned lover, he declared to her in so many words that\r\nhis honour was involved in her not being made the dupe of the young\r\nPrince.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, I should not be his dupe if I cared for him; I must say, I\r\nhave never yet seen a Prince at my feet."\r\n\r\n"If you yield," he went on with a haughty stare, "I may not perhaps be\r\nable to avenge myself on the Prince but I will, most assuredly, be\r\navenged"; and he went out, slamming the doors behind him. Had Fabrizio\r\npresented himself at that moment, he would have won his cause.\r\n\r\n"If you value your life," her lover said to her that evening as he bade\r\nher good night after the performance, "see that it never comes to my\r\nears that the young Prince has been inside your house. I can do nothing\r\nto him, curse him, but do not make me remember that I can do everything\r\nto you!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, my little Fabrizio," cried Fausta, "if I only knew where to find\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\nWounded vanity may carry a young man far who is rich and from his cradle\r\nhas always been surrounded by flatterers. The very genuine passion that\r\nConte M---- felt for Fausta revived with furious intensity; it was in no\r\nway checked by the dangerous prospect of his coming into conflict with\r\nthe only son of the Sovereign in whose dominions he happened to be\r\nstaying; at the same time he had not the courage to try to see this\r\nPrince, or at least to have him followed. Not being able to attack him\r\nin any other way, M---- dared to consider making him ridiculous. "I\r\nshall be banished for ever from the States of Parma," he said to\r\nhimself; "Pshaw! What does that matter?" Had he sought to reconnoitre\r\nthe enemy\'s position, he would have learned that the poor young Prince\r\nnever went out of doors without being followed by three or four old men,\r\ntiresome guardians of etiquette, and that the one pleasure of his choice\r\nthat was permitted him in the world was mineralogy. By day, as by night,\r\nthe little _palazzo_ occupied by Fausta, to which the best society of\r\nParma went in crowds, was surrounded by watchers; M---- knew, hour by\r\nhour, what she was doing, and, more important still, what others were\r\ndoing round about her. There is this to be said in praise of the\r\nprecautions taken by her jealous lover: this eminently capricious woman\r\nhad at first no idea of the multiplication of his vigilance. The reports\r\nof all his agents informed Conte M---- that a very young man, wearing a\r\nwig of red hair, appeared very often beneath Fausta\'s windows, but\r\nalways in a different disguise. "Evidently, it is the young Prince,"\r\nthought M---- "otherwise, why the disguise? And, by gad, a man like me\r\nis not made to give way to him. But for the usurpations of the Venetian\r\nRepublic, I should be a Sovereign Prince myself."\r\n\r\nOn the feast of Santo Stefano, the reports of the spies took on a more\r\nsombre hue; they seemed to indicate that Fausta was beginning to respond\r\nto the stranger\'s advances. "I can go away this instant, and take the\r\nwoman with me!" M---- said to himself; "but no! At Bologna I fled from\r\ndel Dongo; here I should be fleeing before a Prince. But what could the\r\nyoung man say? He might think that he had succeeded in making me afraid.\r\nAnd, by God, I come of as good a family as he." M----- was furious, but,\r\nto crown his misery, he made a particular point of not letting himself\r\nappear in the eyes of Fausta, whom he knew to be of a mocking spirit, in\r\nthe ridiculous character of a jealous lover. On Santo Stefano\'s day,\r\nthen, after having spent an hour with her and been welcomed by her with\r\nan ardour which seemed to him the height of insincerity, he left her,\r\nshortly before eleven o\'clock, getting ready to go and hear mass in the\r\nchurch of San Giovanni. Conte M---- returned home, put on the shabby\r\nblack coat of a young student of theology, and hastened to San Giovanni;\r\nhe chose a place behind one of the tombs that adorn the third chapel on\r\nthe right; he could see everything that went on in the church beneath\r\nthe arm of a cardinal who is represented as kneeling upon his tomb; this\r\nstatue kept the light from the back of the chapel and gave him\r\nsufficient concealment. Presently he saw Fausta arrive, more beautiful\r\nthan ever. She was in full array, and a score of admirers, drawn from\r\nthe highest ranks of society, furnished her with an escort. Joyous\r\nsmiles broke from her eyes and lips. "It is evident," thought the\r\njealous wretch, "that she counts upon meeting here the man she loves,\r\nwhom for a long time, perhaps, thanks to me, she has been prevented from\r\nseeing." Suddenly, the keen look of happiness in her eyes seemed to\r\ndouble in intensity; "My rival is here," muttered M----, and the fury of\r\nhis outraged vanity knew no bounds. "What sort of figure do I cut here,\r\nserving as pendant to a young Prince in disguise?" But despite every\r\neffort on his part, he could never succeed in identifying this rival,\r\nfor whom his famished gaze kept seeking in every direction.\r\n\r\nAll through the service Fausta, after letting her eyes wander over the\r\nwhole church, would end by bringing her gaze to rest, charged with love\r\nand happiness, on the dim corner in which M---- was concealed. In an\r\nimpassioned heart, love is liable to exaggerate the slightest shades of\r\nmeaning, it draws from them the most ridiculous conclusions; did not\r\npoor M---- end by persuading himself that Fausta had seen him, that,\r\nhaving in spite of his efforts perceived his deadly jealousy, she wished\r\nto reproach him with it and at the same time to console him for it with\r\nthese tender glances?\r\n\r\nThe tomb of the cardinal, behind which M---- had taken his post of\r\nobservation, was raised four or five feet above the marble floor of San\r\nGiovanni. The fashionable mass ending about one o\'clock, the majority of\r\nthe faithful left the church, and Fausta dismissed the _beaux_ of the\r\ntown, on a pretext of devotion; as she remained kneeling on her chair,\r\nher eyes, which had grown more tender and more brilliant, were fixed on\r\nM----; since there were now only a few people left in the building, she\r\nno longer put her eyes to the trouble of ranging over the whole of it\r\nbefore coming joyfully to rest on the cardinal\'s statue. "What\r\ndelicacy!" thought Conte M----, imagining that he was the object of her\r\ngaze. At length Fausta rose and quickly left the church after first\r\nmaking some odd movements with her hands.\r\n\r\nM----, blind with love and almost entirely relieved of his mad jealousy,\r\nhad left his post to fly to his mistress\'s _palazzo_ and thank her a\r\nthousand, thousand times, when, as he passed in front of the cardinal\'s\r\ntomb, he noticed a young man all in black: this funereal being had\r\nremained until then on his knees, close against the epitaph on the tomb,\r\nin such a position that the eyes of the jealous lover, in their search\r\nfor him, must pass over his head and miss him altogether.\r\n\r\nThis young man rose, moved briskly away, and was immediately surrounded\r\nby seven or eight persons, somewhat clumsy in their gait, of a singular\r\nappearance, who seemed to belong to him. M----- hurried after him, but,\r\nwithout any marked sign of obstruction, was stopped in the narrow\r\npassage formed by the wooden drum of the door, by these clumsy men who\r\nwere protecting his rival; and when finally, at the tail of their\r\nprocession, he reached the street, he was in time only to see someone\r\nshut the door of a carriage of humble aspect, which, by an odd contrast,\r\nwas drawn by a pair of excellent horses, and in a moment had passed out\r\nof sight.\r\n\r\nHe returned home panting with fury; presently there arrived his\r\nwatchers, who reported impassively that that morning the mysterious\r\nlover, disguised as a priest, had been kneeling in an attitude of great\r\ndevotion against a tomb which stood in the entrance of a dark chapel in\r\nthe church of San Giovanni. Fausta had remained in the church until it\r\nwas almost empty, and had then rapidly exchanged certain signs with the\r\nstranger; with her hands she had seemed to be making a series of\r\ncrosses. M---- hastened to the faithless one\'s house; for the first time\r\nshe could not conceal her uneasiness; she told him, with the artless\r\nmendacity of a passionate woman that, as usual, she had gone to San\r\nGiovanni, but that she had seen no sign there of that man who was\r\npersecuting her. On hearing these words, M----, beside himself with\r\nrage, railed at her as at the vilest of creatures, told her everything\r\nthat he had seen himself, and, the boldness of her lies increasing with\r\nthe force of his accusations, took his dagger and flung himself upon\r\nher. With great coolness Fausta said to him:\r\n\r\n"Very well, everything you complain of is the absolute truth, but I have\r\ntried to keep it from you so that you should not go rushing desperately\r\ninto mad plans of vengeance which may ruin us both; for, let me tell you\r\nonce for all, as far as I can make out, the man who is persecuting me\r\nwith his attentions is one who is accustomed not to meet with any\r\nopposition to his wishes, in this country at any rate." Having very\r\nskilfully reminded M---- that, after all, he had no legal authority over\r\nher, Fausta ended by saying that probably she would not go again to the\r\nchurch of San Giovanni. M---- was desperately in love; a trace of\r\ncoquetry had perhaps combined itself with prudence in the young woman\'s\r\nheart; he felt himself disarmed. He thought of leaving Parma; the young\r\nPrince, however powerful he might be, could not follow him, or if he did\r\nfollow him would cease to be anything more than his equal. But pride\r\nrepresented to him afresh that this departure must inevitably have the\r\nappearance of a flight, and Conte M---- forbade himself to think of it.\r\n\r\n"He has no suspicion that my little Fabrizio is here," the singer said\r\nto herself, delighted, "and now we can make a fool of him in the most\r\npriceless fashion!"\r\n\r\nFabrizio had no inkling of his good fortune; finding next day that the\r\nsinger\'s windows were carefully shuttered, and not seeing her anywhere,\r\nhe began to feel that the joke was lasting rather too long. He felt some\r\nremorse. "In what sort of position am I putting that poor Conte Mosca,\r\nand he the Minister of Police! They will think he is my accomplice, I\r\nshall have come to this place to ruin his career! But if I abandon a\r\nproject I have been following for so long, what will the Duchessa say\r\nwhen I tell her of my essays in love?"\r\n\r\nOne evening when, on the point of giving up everything, he was\r\nmoralising thus to himself, as he strolled under the tall trees which\r\ndivided Fausta\'s _palazzo_ from the citadel, he observed that he was\r\nbeing followed by a spy of diminutive stature; in vain did he attempt to\r\nshake him off by turning down various streets, this microscopic being\r\nseemed always to cling to his heels. Growing impatient, he dashed into a\r\nlonely street running along the bank of the Parma, where his men were\r\nambushed; on a signal from him they leaped out upon the poor little spy,\r\nwho flung himself at their feet; it was Bettina, Fausta\'s maid; after\r\nthree days of boredom and seclusion, disguised as a man to escape the\r\ndagger of Conte M----, of whom her mistress and she were in great dread,\r\nshe had undertaken to come out and tell Fabrizio to see someone loved\r\nhim passionately and was burning to see him, but that the said person\r\ncould not appear any more in the church of San Giovanni. "The time has\r\ncome," Fabrizio said to himself, "hurrah for persistence!"\r\n\r\nThe little maid was exceedingly pretty, a fact which took Fabrizio\'s\r\nmind from his moralisings. She told him that the avenue and all the\r\nstreets through which he had passed that evening were being jealously\r\nwatched, though quite unobtrusively, by M----\'s spies. They had taken\r\nrooms on the ground floors or on the first storeys of the houses; hidden\r\nbehind the shutters and keeping absolutely silent, they observed\r\neverything that went on in the apparently quite deserted street, and\r\nheard all that was said.\r\n\r\n"If those spies had recognised my voice," said little Bettina, "I should\r\nhave been stabbed without mercy as soon as I got back to the house, and\r\nmy poor mistress with me, perhaps."\r\n\r\nThis terror rendered her charming in Fabrizio\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"Conte M----," she went on, "is furious, and the Signora knows that he\r\nwill stick at nothing. . . . She told me to say to you that she would\r\nlike to be a hundred leagues away from here with you."\r\n\r\nThen she gave an account of the scene on St. Stephen\'s day, and of the\r\nfury of M----, who had missed none of the glances and signs of affection\r\nwhich Fausta, madly in love that day with Fabrizio, had directed towards\r\nhim. The Conte had drawn his dagger, had seized Fausta by the hair, and,\r\nbut for her presence of mind, she must have perished.\r\n\r\nFabrizio made the pretty Bettina come up to a little apartment which he\r\nhad near there. He told her that he came from Turin, and was the son of\r\nan important personage who happened at that moment to be in Parma, which\r\nmeant that he had to be most careful in his movements. Bettina replied\r\nwith a smile that he was a far grander gentleman than he chose to\r\nappear. It took our hero some little time to realise that the charming\r\ngirl took him for no less a personage than the Crown Prince himself.\r\nFausta was beginning to be frightened, and to love Fabrizio; she had\r\ntaken the precaution of not mentioning his name to her maid, but of\r\nspeaking to her always of the Prince. Finally Fabrizio admitted to the\r\npretty girl that she had guessed aright: "But if my name gets out," he\r\nadded, "in spite of the great passion of which I have furnished your\r\nmistress with so many proofs, I shall be obliged to cease to see her,\r\nand at once my father\'s Ministers, those rascally jokers whom I shall\r\nbring down from their high places some day, will not fail to send her an\r\norder to quit the country which up to now she has been adorning with her\r\npresence."\r\n\r\nTowards morning, Fabrizio arranged with the little lady\'s maid a number\r\nof plans by which he might gain admission to Fausta\'s house. He summoned\r\nLodovico and another of his retainers, a man of great cunning, who came\r\nto an understanding with Bettina while he himself wrote the most\r\nextravagant letter to Fausta; the situation allowed all the\r\nexaggerations of tragedy, and Fabrizio did not miss the opportunity. It\r\nwas not until day was breaking that he parted from the little lady\'s\r\nmaid, whom he left highly satisfied with the ways of the young Prince.\r\n\r\nIt had been repeated a hundred times over that, Fausta having now come\r\nto an understanding with her lover, the latter was no longer to pass to\r\nand fro beneath the windows of the little _palazzo_ except when he could\r\nbe admitted there, and that then a signal would be given. But Fabrizio,\r\nin love with Bettina, and believing himself to have come almost to the\r\npoint with Fausta, could not confine himself to his village two leagues\r\noutside Parma. The following evening, about midnight, he came on\r\nhorseback and with a good escort to sing under Fausta\'s windows an air\r\nthen in fashion, the words of which he altered. "Is not this the way in\r\nwhich our friends the lovers behave?" he asked himself.\r\n\r\nNow that Fausta had shewn a desire to meet him, all this pursuit seemed\r\nto Fabrizio very tedious. "No, I am not really in love in the least," he\r\nassured himself as he sang (none too well) beneath the windows of the\r\nlittle _palazzo_; "Bettina seems to me a hundred times preferable to\r\nFausta, and it is by her that I should like to be received at this\r\nmoment." Fabrizio, distinctly bored, was returning to his village when,\r\nfive hundred yards from Fausta\'s _palazzo_, fifteen or twenty men flung\r\nthemselves upon him; four of them seized his horse by the bridle, two\r\nothers took hold of his arms. Lodovico and Fabrizio\'s _bravi_ were\r\nattacked, but managed to escape; they fired several shots with their\r\npistols. All this was the affair of an instant: fifty lighted torches\r\nappeared in the street in the twinkling of an eye, as though by magic.\r\nAll these men were well armed. Fabrizio had jumped down from his horse\r\nin spite of the men who were holding him; he tried to clear a space\r\nround him; he even wounded one of the men who was gripping his arms in\r\nhands like a pair of vices; but he was greatly surprised to hear this\r\nman say to him, in the most respectful tone:\r\n\r\n"Your Highness will give me a good pension for this wound, which will be\r\nbetter for me than falling into the crime of high treason by drawing my\r\nsword against my Prince."\r\n\r\n"So this is the punishment I get for my folly," thought Fabrizio; "I\r\nshall have damned myself for a sin which did not seem to me in the least\r\nattractive."\r\n\r\nScarcely had this little attempt at a battle finished, when a number of\r\nlackeys in full livery appeared with a sedan-chair gilded and painted in\r\nan odd fashion. It was one of those grotesque chairs used by masked\r\nrevellers at carnival time. Six men, with daggers in their hands,\r\nrequested His Highness to get into it, telling him that the cold night\r\nair might be injurious to his voice: they affected the most reverential\r\nforms, the title "Prince" being every moment repeated and almost\r\nshouted. The procession began to move on. Fabrizio counted in the street\r\nmore than fifty men carrying lighted torches. It might be about one\r\no\'clock in the morning; all the populace was gazing out of the windows,\r\nthe whole thing went off with a certain gravity. "I was afraid of\r\ndagger-thrusts on Conte M----\'s part," Fabrizio said to himself; "he\r\ncontents himself with making a fool of me; I had not suspected him of\r\nsuch good taste. But does he really think that he has the Prince to deal\r\nwith? If he knows that I am only Fabrizio, ware the dirk!"\r\n\r\nThese fifty men carrying torches and the twenty armed men, after\r\nstopping for a long interval under Fausta\'s windows, proceeded to parade\r\nbefore the finest _palazzi_ in the town. A pair of _maggiordomi_ posted\r\none on either side of the sedan-chair, asked His Highness from time to\r\ntime whether he had any order to give them. Fabrizio took care not to\r\nlose his head; by the light which the torches cast he saw that Lodovico\r\nand his men were following the procession as closely as possible.\r\nFabrizio said to himself: "Lodovico has only nine or ten men, and dares\r\nnot attack." From the interior of his sedan-chair he could see quite\r\nplainly that the men responsible for carrying out this practical joke\r\nwere armed to the teeth. He made a show of talking and laughing with the\r\n_maggiordomi_ who were looking after him. After more than two hours of\r\nthis triumphal march, he saw that they were about to pass the end of the\r\nstreet in which the _palazzo_ Sanseverina stood.\r\n\r\nAs they turned the corner, he quickly opened the door in the front of\r\nthe chair, jumped out over one of the carrying poles, felled with a blow\r\nfrom his dagger one of the flunkeys who thrust a torch into his face; he\r\nreceived a stab in the shoulder from a dirk; a second flunkey singed his\r\nbeard with his lighted torch, and finally Fabrizio reached Lodovico to\r\nwhom he shouted: "Kill! Kill everyone carrying a torch!" Lodovico used\r\nhis sword, and delivered Fabrizio from two men who had started in\r\npursuit of him. He arrived, running, at the door of the _palazzo_\r\nSanseverina; out of curiosity the porter had opened the little door,\r\nthree feet high, that was cut in the big door, and was gazing in\r\nbewilderment at this great mass of torches. Fabrizio sprang inside and\r\nshut this miniature door behind him; he ran to the garden and escaped by\r\na gate which opened on to an unfrequented street. An hour later, he was\r\nout of the town; at daybreak he crossed the frontier of the States of\r\nModena, and was safe. That evening he entered Bologna. "Here is a fine\r\nexpedition," he said to himself; "I never even managed to speak to my\r\ncharmer." He made haste to write letters of apology to the Conte and the\r\nDuchessa, prudent letters which, while describing all that was going on\r\nin his heart, could not give away any information to an enemy. "I was in\r\nlove with love," he said to the Duchessa, "I have done everything in the\r\nworld to acquire knowledge of it; but it appears that nature has refused\r\nme a heart to love, and to be melancholy; I cannot raise myself above\r\nthe level of vulgar pleasure," and so forth.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to give any idea of the stir that this escapade\r\ncaused in Parma. The mystery of it excited curiosity: innumerable people\r\nhad seen the torches and the sedan-chair. But who was the man they were\r\ncarrying away, to whom every mark of respect was paid? No one of note\r\nwas missing from the town next day.\r\n\r\nThe humble folk who lived in the street from which the prisoner had made\r\nhis escape did indeed say that they had seen a corpse; but in daylight,\r\nwhen they ventured out of their houses, they found no other traces of\r\nthe fray than quantities of blood spilled on the pavement. More than\r\ntwenty thousand sightseers came to visit the street that day. Italian\r\ntowns are accustomed to singular spectacles, but the _why_ and the\r\n_wherefore_ of these are always known. What shocked Parma about this\r\noccurrence was that even a month afterwards, when people had ceased to\r\nspeak of nothing but the torchlight procession, nobody, thanks to the\r\nprudence of Conte Mosca, had been able to guess the name of the rival\r\nwho had sought to carry off Fausta, from Conte M----. This jealous and\r\nvindictive lover had taken flight at the beginning of the parade. By the\r\nConte\'s order. Fausta was sent to the citadel. The Duchessa laughed\r\nheartily over a little act of injustice which the Conte was obliged to\r\ncommit to put a stop to the curiosity of the Prince, who otherwise might\r\nhave succeeded in hitting upon the name of Fabrizio.\r\n\r\nThere was to be seen at Parma a scholar, arrived there from the North to\r\nwrite a History of the Middle Ages; he was in search of manuscripts in\r\nthe libraries, and the Conte had given him every possible facility. But\r\nthis scholar, who was still quite young, shewed a violent temper; he\r\nbelieved, for one thing, that everybody in Parma was trying to make a\r\nfool of him. It was true that the boys in the streets sometimes followed\r\nhim on account of an immense shock of bright red hair which he displayed\r\nwith pride. This scholar imagined that at his inn they were asking\r\nexaggerated prices for everything, and he never paid for the smallest\r\ntrifle without first looking up its price in the _Travels_ of a certain\r\nMrs. Starke, a book which has gone into its twentieth edition because it\r\nindicates to the prudent Englishman the price of a turkey, an apple, a\r\nglass of milk, and so forth.\r\n\r\nThe scholar with the fiery crest, on the evening of the very day on\r\nwhich Fabrizio made this forced excursion, flew into a rage at his inn,\r\nand drew from his pocket a brace of small pistols to avenge himself on\r\nthe _cameriere_ who demanded two soldi for an indifferent peach. He was\r\narrested, for to carry pocket pistols is a serious crime!\r\n\r\nAs this irascible scholar was long and lean, the Conte conceived the\r\nidea, next morning, of making him pass in the Prince\'s eyes as the rash\r\nfellow who, having tried to steal away Fausta from Conte M----, had\r\nafterwards been hoaxed. The carrying of pocket pistols is punishable at\r\nParma with three years in the galleys; but this punishment is never\r\nenforced. After a fortnight in prison, during which time the scholar had\r\nseen no one but a lawyer who had put in him a terrible fright by his\r\naccount of the atrocious laws aimed by the pusillanimity of those in\r\npower against the bearers of hidden arms, another lawyer visited the\r\nprison and told him of the expedition inflicted by Conte M---- on a\r\nrival who had not yet been identified. "The police do not wish to admit\r\nto the Prince that they have not been able to find out who this rival\r\nis. Confess that you were seeking to find favour with Fausta; that fifty\r\nbrigands carried you off while you were singing beneath her window; that\r\nfor an hour they took you about the town in a sedan-chair without saying\r\nanything to you that was not perfectly proper. There is nothing\r\nhumiliating about this confession, you are asked to say only one word.\r\nAs soon as, by saying it, you have relieved the police from their\r\ndifficulty, you will be put into a post-chaise and driven to the\r\nfrontier, where they will bid you good-bye."\r\n\r\nThe scholar held out for a month; two or three times the Prince was on\r\nthe point of having him brought to the Ministry of the Interior, and of\r\nbeing present in person at his examination. But at last he gave no more\r\nthought to the matter when the scholar, losing patience, decided to\r\nconfess everything, and was conveyed to the frontier. The Prince\r\nremained convinced that Conte M----\'s rival had a forest of red hair.\r\n\r\nThree days after the escapade, while Fabrizio, who was in hiding at\r\nBologna, was planning with the faithful Lodovico the best way to catch\r\nConte M----, he learned that he too was hiding in a village in the\r\nmountains on the road to Florence. The Conte had only two or three of\r\nhis _buli_ with him; next day, just as he was coming home from his ride,\r\nhe was seized by eight men in masks who gave him to understand that they\r\nwere _sbirri_ from Parma. They conducted him, after bandaging his eyes,\r\nto an inn two leagues farther up the mountains, where he found himself\r\ntreated with the utmost possible respect, and an abundant supper\r\nawaiting him. He was served with the best wines of Italy and Spain.\r\n\r\n"Am I a State prisoner then?" asked the Conte.\r\n\r\n"Nothing of the sort," the masked Lodovico answered him, most politely.\r\n"You have given offence to a private citizen by taking upon yourself to\r\nhave him carried about in a sedan-chair; to-morrow morning he wishes to\r\nfight a duel with you. If you kill him, you will find a pair of good\r\nhorses, money, and relays prepared for you along the road to Genoa."\r\n\r\n"What is the name of this fire-eater?" asked the Conte with irritation.\r\n\r\n"He is called _Bombace_. You will have the choice of weapons and good\r\nseconds, thoroughly loyal, but it is essential that one of you die!"\r\n\r\n"Why, it is murder, then!" said the Conte; growing frightened.\r\n\r\n"Please God, no! It is simply a duel to the death with the young man\r\nwhom you have had carried about the streets of Parma in the middle of\r\nthe night, and whose honour would be tarnished if you remained alive.\r\nOne or other of you is superfluous on this earth, therefore try to kill\r\nhim; you shall have swords, pistols, sabres, all the weapons that can be\r\nprocured at a few hours\' notice, for we have to make haste; the police\r\nat Bologna are most diligent, as you perhaps know, and they must on no\r\naccount interfere with this duel which is necessary to the honour of the\r\nyoung man whom you have made to look foolish."\r\n\r\n"But if this young man is a Prince. . . ."\r\n\r\n"He is a private citizen like yourself, and indeed a great deal less\r\nwealthy than you, but he wishes to fight to the death, and he will force\r\nyou to fight, I warn you."\r\n\r\n"Nothing in the world frightens me!" cried M----.\r\n\r\n"That is just what your adversary most passionately desires," replied\r\nLodovico. "To-morrow, at dawn, prepare to defend your life; it will be\r\nattacked by a man who has good reason to be extremely angry, and will\r\nnot let you off lightly; I repeat that you will have the choice of\r\nweapons; and remember to make your will."\r\n\r\nNext morning, about six o\'clock, breakfast was brought to Conte M----, a\r\ndoor was then opened in the room in which he was confined, and he was\r\nmade to step into the courtyard of a country inn; this courtyard was\r\nsurrounded by hedges and walls of a certain height, and its doors had\r\nbeen carefully closed.\r\n\r\nIn a corner, upon a table which the Conte was requested to approach, he\r\nfound several bottles of wine and brandy, two pistols, two swords, two\r\nsabres, paper and ink; a score of _contadini_ stood in the windows of\r\nthe inn which overlooked the courtyard. The Conte implored their pity.\r\n"They want to murder me," he cried, "save my life!"\r\n\r\n"You deceive yourself, or you wish to deceive others," called out\r\nFabrizio, who was at the opposite corner of the courtyard, beside a table\r\nstrewn with weapons. He was in his shirtsleeves, and his face was\r\nconcealed by one of those wire masks which one finds in fencing-rooms.\r\n\r\n"I require you," Fabrizio went on, "to put on the wire mask which is\r\nlying beside you, then to advance towards me with a sword or with\r\npistols; as you were told yesterday evening, you have the choice of\r\nweapons."\r\n\r\nConte M---- raised endless difficulties, and seemed most reluctant to\r\nfight; Fabrizio, for his part, was afraid of the arrival of the police,\r\nalthough they were in the mountains quite five leagues from Bologna. He\r\nended by hurling at his rival the most atrocious insults; at last he had\r\nthe good fortune to enrage Conte M----, who seized a sword and advanced\r\nupon him. The fight began quietly enough.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes, it was interrupted by a great tumult. Our hero had\r\nbeen quite aware that he was involving himself in an action which, for\r\nthe rest of his life, might be a subject of reproach or at least of\r\nslanderous imputations. He had sent Lodovico into the country to procure\r\nwitnesses. Lodovico gave money to some strangers who were working in a\r\nneighbouring wood; they ran to the inn shouting, thinking that the game\r\nwas to kill an enemy of the man who had paid them. When they reached the\r\ninn, Lodovico asked them to keep their eyes open and to notice whether\r\neither of the two young men who were fighting acted treacherously and\r\ntook an unfair advantage over the other.\r\n\r\nThe fight, which had been interrupted for the time being by the cries of\r\nmurder uttered by the _contadini_, was slow in beginning again. Fabrizio\r\noffered fresh insults to the fatuity of the Conte. "Signor Conte," he\r\nshouted to him, "when one is insolent, one ought to be brave also. I\r\nfeel that the conditions are hard on you; you prefer to pay people who\r\nare brave." The Conte, once more stung to action, began to shout to him\r\nthat he had for years frequented the fencing-school of the famous\r\nBattistini at Naples, and that he was going to punish his insolence.\r\nConte M----\'s anger having at length reappeared, he fought with a\r\ncertain determination, which did not however prevent Fabrizio from\r\ngiving him a very pretty thrust in the chest with his sword, which kept\r\nhim in bed for several months. Lodovico, while giving first aid to the\r\nwounded man, whispered in his ear: "If you report this duel to the\r\npolice, I will have you stabbed in your bed."\r\n\r\nFabrizio withdrew to Florence; as he had remained in hiding at Bologna,\r\nit was only at Florence that he received all the Duchessa\'s letters of\r\nreproach; she could not forgive his having come to her concert and made\r\nno attempt to speak to her. Fabrizio was delighted by Conte Mosca\'s\r\nletters; they breathed a sincere friendship and the most noble\r\nsentiments. He gathered that the Conte had written to Bologna, in such a\r\nway as to clear him of any suspicion which might attach to him as a\r\nresult of the duel. The police behaved with perfect justice: they\r\nreported that two strangers, of whom one only, the wounded man, was\r\nknown to them (namely Conte M----), had fought with swords, in front of\r\nmore than thirty _contadini_, among whom there had arrived towards the\r\nend of the fight the curate of the village, who had made vain efforts to\r\nseparate the combatants. As the name of Giuseppe Bossi had never been\r\nmentioned, less than two months afterwards Fabrizio returned to Bologna,\r\nmore convinced than ever that his destiny condemned him never to know\r\nthe noble and intellectual side of love. So much he gave himself the\r\npleasure of explaining at great length to the Duchessa; he was\r\nthoroughly tired of his solitary life and now felt a passionate desire\r\nto return to those charming evenings which he used to pass with the\r\nConte and his aunt. Since then he had never tasted the delights of good\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n"I am so bored with the thought of the love which I sought to give\r\nmyself, and of Fausta," he wrote to the Duchessa, "that now, even if her\r\nfancy were still to favour me, I would not go twenty leagues to hold her\r\nto her promise; so have no fear, as you tell me you have, of my going to\r\nParis, where I see that she has now made her appearance and has created\r\na _furore_. I would travel all the leagues in the world to spend an\r\nevening with you and with that Conte who is so good to his friends."\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Pier-Luigi, the first sovereign of the Farnese family, so\r\nrenowned for his virtues, was, as is generally known, a natural son of\r\nHis Holiness Pope Paul III.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME I\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CHARTERHOUSE OF PARMA VOLUME 1\r\n(OF 2) ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
