The external incidents which\r\ndirect its course are mostly an unexaggerated reproduction of the\r\nrecollections of old persons well known to the author in childhood, but\r\nnow long dead, who were eye-witnesses of those scenes.  If wholly\r\ntranscribed their recollections would have filled a volume thrice the\r\nlength of \'The Trumpet-Major.\'\r\n\r\nDown to the middle of this century, and later, there were not wanting, in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the places more or less clearly indicated herein,\r\ncasual relics of the circumstances amid which the action moves--our\r\npreparations for defence against the threatened invasion of England by\r\nBuonaparte.  An outhouse door riddled with bullet-holes, which had been\r\nextemporized by a solitary man as a target for firelock practice when the\r\nlanding was hourly expected, a heap of bricks and clods on a beacon-hill,\r\nwhich had formed the chimney and walls of the hut occupied by the beacon-\r\nkeeper, worm-eaten shafts and iron heads of pikes for the use of those\r\nwho had no better weapons, ridges on the down thrown up during the\r\nencampment, fragments of volunteer uniform, and other such lingering\r\nremains, brought to my imagination in early childhood the state of\r\naffairs at the date of the war more vividly than volumes of history could\r\nhave done.\r\n\r\nThose who have attempted to construct a coherent narrative of past times\r\nfrom the fragmentary information furnished by survivors, are aware of the\r\ndifficulty of ascertaining the true sequence of events indiscriminately\r\nrecalled.  For this purpose the newspapers of the date were\r\nindispensable.  Of other documents consulted I may mention, for the\r\nsatisfaction of those who love a true story, that the \'Address to all\r\nRanks and Descriptions of Englishmen\' was transcribed from an original\r\ncopy in a local museum; that the hieroglyphic portrait of Napoleon\r\nexisted as a print down to the present day in an old woman\'s cottage near\r\n\'Overcombe;\' that the particulars of the King\'s doings at his favourite\r\nwatering-place were augmented by details from records of the time.  The\r\ndrilling scene of the local militia received some additions from an\r\naccount given in so grave a work as Gifford\'s \'History of the Wars of the\r\nFrench Revolution\' (London, 1817).  But on reference to the History I\r\nfind I was mistaken in supposing the account to be advanced as authentic,\r\nor to refer to rural England.  However, it does in a large degree accord\r\nwith the local traditions of such scenes that I have heard recounted,\r\ntimes without number, and the system of drill was tested by reference to\r\nthe Army Regulations of 1801, and other military handbooks.  Almost the\r\nwhole narrative of the supposed landing of the French in the Bay is from\r\noral relation as aforesaid.  Other proofs of the veracity of this\r\nchronicle have escaped my recollection.\r\n\r\nT. H.\r\n\r\n_October_ 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.  WHAT WAS SEEN FROM THE WINDOW OVERLOOKING THE DOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the days of high-waisted and muslin-gowned women, when the vast amount\r\nof soldiering going on in the country was a cause of much trembling to\r\nthe sex, there lived in a village near the Wessex coast two ladies of\r\ngood report, though unfortunately of limited means.  The elder was a Mrs.\r\nMartha Garland, a landscape-painter\'s widow, and the other was her only\r\ndaughter Anne.\r\n\r\nAnne was fair, very fair, in a poetical sense; but in complexion she was\r\nof that particular tint between blonde and brunette which is\r\ninconveniently left without a name.  Her eyes were honest and inquiring,\r\nher mouth cleanly cut and yet not classical, the middle point of her\r\nupper lip scarcely descending so far as it should have done by rights, so\r\nthat at the merest pleasant thought, not to mention a smile, portions of\r\ntwo or three white teeth were uncovered whether she would or not.  Some\r\npeople said that this was very attractive.  She was graceful and slender,\r\nand, though but little above five feet in height, could draw herself up\r\nto look tall.  In her manner, in her comings and goings, in her \'I\'ll do\r\nthis,\' or \'I\'ll do that,\' she combined dignity with sweetness as no other\r\ngirl could do; and any impressionable stranger youths who passed by were\r\nled to yearn for a windfall of speech from her, and to see at the same\r\ntime that they would not get it.  In short, beneath all that was charming\r\nand simple in this young woman there lurked a real firmness, unperceived\r\nat first, as the speck of colour lurks unperceived in the heart of the\r\npalest parsley flower.\r\n\r\nShe wore a white handkerchief to cover her white neck, and a cap on her\r\nhead with a pink ribbon round it, tied in a bow at the front.  She had a\r\ngreat variety of these cap-ribbons, the young men being fond of sending\r\nthem to her as presents until they fell definitely in love with a special\r\nsweetheart elsewhere, when they left off doing so.  Between the border of\r\nher cap and her forehead were ranged a row of round brown curls, like\r\nswallows\' nests under eaves.\r\n\r\nShe lived with her widowed mother in a portion of an ancient building\r\nformerly a manor-house, but now a mill, which, being too large for his\r\nown requirements, the miller had found it convenient to divide and\r\nappropriate in part to these highly respectable tenants.  In this\r\ndwelling Mrs. Garland\'s and Anne\'s ears were soothed morning, noon, and\r\nnight by the music of the mill, the wheels and cogs of which, being of\r\nwood, produced notes that might have borne in their minds a remote\r\nresemblance to the wooden tones of the stopped diapason in an organ.\r\nOccasionally, when the miller was bolting, there was added to these\r\ncontinuous sounds the cheerful clicking of the hopper, which did not\r\ndeprive them of rest except when it was kept going all night; and over\r\nand above all this they had the pleasure of knowing that there crept in\r\nthrough every crevice, door, and window of their dwelling, however\r\ntightly closed, a subtle mist of superfine flour from the grinding room,\r\nquite invisible, but making its presence known in the course of time by\r\ngiving a pallid and ghostly look to the best furniture.  The miller\r\nfrequently apologized to his tenants for the intrusion of this insidious\r\ndry fog; but the widow was of a friendly and thankful nature, and she\r\nsaid that she did not mind it at all, being as it was, not nasty dirt,\r\nbut the blessed staff of life.\r\n\r\nBy good-humour of this sort, and in other ways, Mrs. Garland acknowledged\r\nher friendship for her neighbour, with whom Anne and herself associated\r\nto an extent which she never could have anticipated when, tempted by the\r\nlowness of the rent, they first removed thither after her husband\'s death\r\nfrom a larger house at the other end of the village.  Those who have\r\nlived in remote places where there is what is called no society will\r\ncomprehend the gradual levelling of distinctions that went on in this\r\ncase at some sacrifice of gentility on the part of one household.  The\r\nwidow was sometimes sorry to find with what readiness Anne caught up some\r\ndialect-word or accent from the miller and his friends; but he was so\r\ngood and true-hearted a man, and she so easy-minded, unambitious a woman,\r\nthat she would not make life a solitude for fastidious reasons.  More\r\nthan all, she had good ground for thinking that the miller secretly\r\nadmired her, and this added a piquancy to the situation.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nOn a fine summer morning, when the leaves were warm under the sun, and\r\nthe more industrious bees abroad, diving into every blue and red cup that\r\ncould possibly be considered a flower, Anne was sitting at the back\r\nwindow of her mother\'s portion of the house, measuring out lengths of\r\nworsted for a fringed rug that she was making, which lay, about three-\r\nquarters finished, beside her.  The work, though chromatically brilliant,\r\nwas tedious: a hearth-rug was a thing which nobody worked at from morning\r\nto night; it was taken up and put down; it was in the chair, on the\r\nfloor, across the hand-rail, under the bed, kicked here, kicked there,\r\nrolled away in the closet, brought out again, and so on more capriciously\r\nperhaps than any other home-made article.  Nobody was expected to finish\r\na rug within a calculable period, and the wools of the beginning became\r\nfaded and historical before the end was reached.  A sense of this\r\ninherent nature of worsted-work rather than idleness led Anne to look\r\nrather frequently from the open casement.\r\n\r\nImmediately before her was the large, smooth millpond, over-full, and\r\nintruding into the hedge and into the road.  The water, with its flowing\r\nleaves and spots of froth, was stealing away, like Time, under the dark\r\narch, to tumble over the great slimy wheel within.  On the other side of\r\nthe mill-pond was an open place called the Cross, because it was three-\r\nquarters of one, two lanes and a cattle-drive meeting there.  It was the\r\ngeneral rendezvous and arena of the surrounding village.  Behind this a\r\nsteep slope rose high into the sky, merging in a wide and open down, now\r\nlittered with sheep newly shorn.  The upland by its height completely\r\nsheltered the mill and village from north winds, making summers of\r\nsprings, reducing winters to autumn temperatures, and permitting myrtle\r\nto flourish in the open air.\r\n\r\nThe heaviness of noon pervaded the scene, and under its influence the\r\nsheep had ceased to feed.  Nobody was standing at the Cross, the few\r\ninhabitants being indoors at their dinner.  No human being was on the\r\ndown, and no human eye or interest but Anne\'s seemed to be concerned with\r\nit.  The bees still worked on, and the butterflies did not rest from\r\nroving, their smallness seeming to shield them from the stagnating effect\r\nthat this turning moment of day had on larger creatures.  Otherwise all\r\nwas still.\r\n\r\nThe girl glanced at the down and the sheep for no particular reason; the\r\nsteep margin of turf and daisies rising above the roofs, chimneys, apple-\r\ntrees, and church tower of the hamlet around her, bounded the view from\r\nher position, and it was necessary to look somewhere when she raised her\r\nhead.  While thus engaged in working and stopping her attention was\r\nattracted by the sudden rising and running away of the sheep squatted on\r\nthe down; and there succeeded sounds of a heavy tramping over the hard\r\nsod which the sheep had quitted, the tramp being accompanied by a\r\nmetallic jingle.  Turning her eyes further she beheld two cavalry\r\nsoldiers on bulky grey chargers, armed and accoutred throughout,\r\nascending the down at a point to the left where the incline was\r\ncomparatively easy.  The burnished chains, buckles, and plates of their\r\ntrappings shone like little looking-glasses, and the blue, red, and white\r\nabout them was unsubdued by weather or wear.\r\n\r\nThe two troopers rode proudly on, as if nothing less than crowns and\r\nempires ever concerned their magnificent minds.  They reached that part\r\nof the down which lay just in front of her, where they came to a halt.  In\r\nanother minute there appeared behind them a group containing some half-\r\ndozen more of the same sort.  These came on, halted, and dismounted\r\nlikewise.\r\n\r\nTwo of the soldiers then walked some distance onward together, when one\r\nstood still, the other advancing further, and stretching a white line of\r\ntape between them.  Two more of the men marched to another outlying\r\npoint, where they made marks in the ground.  Thus they walked about and\r\ntook distances, obviously according to some preconcerted scheme.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this systematic proceeding one solitary horseman--a\r\ncommissioned officer, if his uniform could be judged rightly at that\r\ndistance--rode up the down, went over the ground, looked at what the\r\nothers had done, and seemed to think that it was good.  And then the girl\r\nheard yet louder tramps and clankings, and she beheld rising from where\r\nthe others had risen a whole column of cavalry in marching order.  At a\r\ndistance behind these came a cloud of dust enveloping more and more\r\ntroops, their arms and accoutrements reflecting the sun through the haze\r\nin faint flashes, stars, and streaks of light.  The whole body approached\r\nslowly towards the plateau at the top of the down.\r\n\r\nAnne threw down her work, and letting her eyes remain on the nearing\r\nmasses of cavalry, the worsteds getting entangled as they would, said,\r\n\'Mother, mother; come here!  Here\'s such a fine sight!  What does it\r\nmean?  What can they be going to do up there?\'\r\n\r\nThe mother thus invoked ran upstairs and came forward to the window.  She\r\nwas a woman of sanguine mouth and eye, unheroic manner, and pleasant\r\ngeneral appearance; a little more tarnished as to surface, but not much\r\nworse in contour than the girl herself.\r\n\r\nWidow Garland\'s thoughts were those of the period. \'Can it be the\r\nFrench,\' she said, arranging herself for the extremest form of\r\nconsternation.  \'Can that arch-enemy of mankind have landed at last?\'  It\r\nshould be stated that at this time there were two arch-enemies of\r\nmankind--Satan as usual, and Buonaparte, who had sprung up and eclipsed\r\nhis elder rival altogether.  Mrs. Garland alluded, of course, to the\r\njunior gentleman.\r\n\r\n\'It cannot be he,\' said Anne.  \'Ah! there\'s Simon Burden, the man who\r\nwatches at the beacon.  He\'ll know!\'\r\n\r\nShe waved her hand to an aged form of the same colour as the road, who\r\nhad just appeared beyond the mill-pond, and who, though active, was bowed\r\nto that degree which almost reproaches a feeling observer for standing\r\nupright.  The arrival of the soldiery had drawn him out from his drop of\r\ndrink at the \'Duke of York\' as it had attracted Anne.  At her call he\r\ncrossed the mill-bridge, and came towards the window.\r\n\r\nAnne inquired of him what it all meant; but Simon Burden, without\r\nanswering, continued to move on with parted gums, staring at the cavalry\r\non his own private account with a concern that people often show about\r\ntemporal phenomena when such matters can affect them but a short time\r\nlonger.  \'You\'ll walk into the millpond!\' said Anne.  \'What are they\r\ndoing?  You were a soldier many years ago, and ought to know.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t ask me, Mis\'ess Anne,\' said the military relic, depositing his\r\nbody against the wall one limb at a time.  \'I were only in the foot, ye\r\nknow, and never had a clear understanding of horses.  Ay, I be a old man,\r\nand of no judgment now.\'  Some additional pressure, however, caused him\r\nto search further in his worm-eaten magazine of ideas, and he found that\r\nhe did know in a dim irresponsible way.  The soldiers must have come\r\nthere to camp: those men they had seen first were the markers: they had\r\ncome on before the rest to measure out the ground.  He who had\r\naccompanied them was the quartermaster.  \'And so you see they have got\r\nall the lines marked out by the time the regiment have come up,\' he\r\nadded.  \'And then they will--well-a-deary! who\'d ha\' supposed that\r\nOvercombe would see such a day as this!\'\r\n\r\n\'And then they will--\'\r\n\r\n\'Then-- Ah, it\'s gone from me again!\' said Simon.  \'O, and then they will\r\nraise their tents, you know, and picket their horses.  That was it; so it\r\nwas.\'\r\n\r\nBy this time the column of horse had ascended into full view, and they\r\nformed a lively spectacle as they rode along the high ground in marching\r\norder, backed by the pale blue sky, and lit by the southerly sun.  Their\r\nuniform was bright and attractive; white buckskin pantaloons,\r\nthree-quarter boots, scarlet shakos set off with lace, mustachios waxed\r\nto a needle point; and above all, those richly ornamented blue jackets\r\nmantled with the historic pelisse--that fascination to women, and\r\nencumbrance to the wearers themselves.\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis the York Hussars!\' said Simon Burden, brightening like a dying\r\nember fanned.  \'Foreigners to a man, and enrolled long since my time.  But\r\nas good hearty comrades, they say, as you\'ll find in the King\'s service.\'\r\n\r\n\'Here are more and different ones,\' said Mrs. Garland.\r\n\r\nOther troops had, during the last few minutes, been ascending the down at\r\na remoter point, and now drew near.  These were of different weight and\r\nbuild from the others; lighter men, in helmet hats, with white plumes.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know which I like best,\' said Anne.  \'These, I think, after\r\nall.\'\r\n\r\nSimon, who had been looking hard at the latter, now said that they were\r\nthe --th Dragoons.\r\n\r\n\'All Englishmen they,\' said the old man.  \'They lay at Budmouth barracks\r\na few years ago.\'\r\n\r\n\'They did.  I remember it,\' said Mrs. Garland.\r\n\r\n\'And lots of the chaps about here \'listed at the time,\' said Simon.  \'I\r\ncan call to mind that there was--ah, \'tis gone from me again!  However,\r\nall that\'s of little account now.\'\r\n\r\nThe dragoons passed in front of the lookers-on as the others had done,\r\nand their gay plumes, which had hung lazily during the ascent, swung to\r\nnorthward as they reached the top, showing that on the summit a fresh\r\nbreeze blew.  \'But look across there,\' said Anne.  There had entered upon\r\nthe down from another direction several battalions of foot, in white\r\nkerseymere breeches and cloth gaiters.  They seemed to be weary from a\r\nlong march, the original black of their gaiters and boots being whity-\r\nbrown with dust.  Presently came regimental waggons, and the private\r\ncanteen carts which followed at the end of a convoy.\r\n\r\nThe space in front of the mill-pond was now occupied by nearly all the\r\ninhabitants of the village, who had turned out in alarm, and remained for\r\npleasure, their eyes lighted up with interest in what they saw; for\r\ntrappings and regimentals, war horses and men, in towns an attraction,\r\nwere here almost a sublimity.\r\n\r\nThe troops filed to their lines, dismounted, and in quick time took off\r\ntheir accoutrements, rolled up their sheep-skins, picketed and unbitted\r\ntheir horses, and made ready to erect the tents as soon as they could be\r\ntaken from the waggons and brought forward.  When this was done, at a\r\ngiven signal the canvases flew up from the sod; and thenceforth every man\r\nhad a place in which to lay his head.\r\n\r\nThough nobody seemed to be looking on but the few at the window and in\r\nthe village street, there were, as a matter of fact, many eyes converging\r\nupon that military arrival in its high and conspicuous position, not to\r\nmention the glances of birds and other wild creatures.  Men in distant\r\ngardens, women in orchards and at cottage-doors, shepherds on remote\r\nhills, turnip-hoers in blue-green enclosures miles away, captains with\r\nspy-glasses out at sea, were regarding the picture keenly.  Those three\r\nor four thousand men of one machine-like movement, some of them\r\nswashbucklers by nature; others, doubtless, of a quiet shop-keeping\r\ndisposition who had inadvertently got into uniform--all of them had\r\narrived from nobody knew where, and hence were matter of great curiosity.\r\nThey seemed to the mere eye to belong to a different order of beings from\r\nthose who inhabited the valleys below.  Apparently unconscious and\r\ncareless of what all the world was doing elsewhere, they remained\r\npicturesquely engrossed in the business of making themselves a habitation\r\non the isolated spot which they had chosen.\r\n\r\nMrs. Garland was of a festive and sanguine turn of mind, a woman soon set\r\nup and soon set down, and the coming of the regiments quite excited her.\r\nShe thought there was reason for putting on her best cap, thought that\r\nperhaps there was not; that she would hurry on the dinner and go out in\r\nthe afternoon; then that she would, after all, do nothing unusual, nor\r\nshow any silly excitements whatever, since they were unbecoming in a\r\nmother and a widow.  Thus circumscribing her intentions till she was\r\ntoned down to an ordinary person of forty, Mrs. Garland accompanied her\r\ndaughter downstairs to dine, saying, \'Presently we will call on Miller\r\nLoveday, and hear what he thinks of it all.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  SOMEBODY KNOCKS AND COMES IN\r\n\r\n\r\nMiller Loveday was the representative of an ancient family of\r\ncorn-grinders whose history is lost in the mists of antiquity.  His\r\nancestral line was contemporaneous with that of De Ros, Howard, and De La\r\nZouche; but, owing to some trifling deficiency in the possessions of the\r\nhouse of Loveday, the individual names and intermarriages of its members\r\nwere not recorded during the Middle Ages, and thus their private lives in\r\nany given century were uncertain.  But it was known that the family had\r\nformed matrimonial alliances with farmers not so very small, and once\r\nwith a gentleman-tanner, who had for many years purchased after their\r\ndeath the horses of the most aristocratic persons in the county--fiery\r\nsteeds that earlier in their career had been valued at many hundred\r\nguineas.\r\n\r\nIt was also ascertained that Mr. Loveday\'s great-grandparents had been\r\neight in number, and his great-great-grandparents sixteen, every one of\r\nwhom reached to years of discretion: at every stage backwards his sires\r\nand gammers thus doubled and doubled till they became a vast body of\r\nGothic ladies and gentlemen of the rank known as ceorls or villeins, full\r\nof importance to the country at large, and ramifying throughout the\r\nunwritten history of England.  His immediate father had greatly improved\r\nthe value of their residence by building a new chimney, and setting up an\r\nadditional pair of millstones.\r\n\r\nOvercombe Mill presented at one end the appearance of a hard-worked house\r\nslipping into the river, and at the other of an idle, genteel place, half-\r\ncloaked with creepers at this time of the year, and having no visible\r\nconnexion with flour.  It had hips instead of gables, giving it a round-\r\nshouldered look, four chimneys with no smoke coming out of them, two\r\nzigzag cracks in the wall, several open windows, with a looking-glass\r\nhere and there inside, showing its warped back to the passer-by; snowy\r\ndimity curtains waving in the draught; two mill doors, one above the\r\nother, the upper enabling a person to step out upon nothing at a height\r\nof ten feet from the ground; a gaping arch vomiting the river, and a\r\nlean, long-nosed fellow looking out from the mill doorway, who was the\r\nhired grinder, except when a bulging fifteen stone man occupied the same\r\nplace, namely, the miller himself.\r\n\r\nBehind the mill door, and invisible to the mere wayfarer who did not\r\nvisit the family, were chalked addition and subtraction sums, many of\r\nthem originally done wrong, and the figures half rubbed out and\r\ncorrected, noughts being turned into nines, and ones into twos.  These\r\nwere the miller\'s private calculations.  There were also chalked in the\r\nsame place rows and rows of strokes like open palings, representing the\r\ncalculations of the grinder, who in his youthful ciphering studies had\r\nnot gone so far as Arabic figures.\r\n\r\nIn the court in front were two worn-out millstones, made useful again by\r\nbeing let in level with the ground.  Here people stood to smoke and\r\nconsider things in muddy weather; and cats slept on the clean surfaces\r\nwhen it was hot.  In the large stubbard-tree at the corner of the garden\r\nwas erected a pole of larch fir, which the miller had bought with others\r\nat a sale of small timber in Damer\'s Wood one Christmas week.  It rose\r\nfrom the upper boughs of the tree to about the height of a fisherman\'s\r\nmast, and on the top was a vane in the form of a sailor with his arm\r\nstretched out.  When the sun shone upon this figure it could be seen that\r\nthe greater part of his countenance was gone, and the paint washed from\r\nhis body so far as to reveal that he had been a soldier in red before he\r\nbecame a sailor in blue.  The image had, in fact, been John, one of our\r\ncoming characters, and was then turned into Robert, another of them.  This\r\nrevolving piece of statuary could not, however, be relied on as a vane,\r\nowing to the neighbouring hill, which formed variable currents in the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nThe leafy and quieter wing of the mill-house was the part occupied by\r\nMrs. Garland and her daughter, who made up in summer-time for the\r\nnarrowness of their quarters by overflowing into the garden on stools and\r\nchairs.  The parlour or dining-room had a stone floor--a fact which the\r\nwidow sought to disguise by double carpeting, lest the standing of Anne\r\nand herself should be lowered in the public eye.  Here now the mid-day\r\nmeal went lightly and mincingly on, as it does where there is no greedy\r\ncarnivorous man to keep the dishes about, and was hanging on the close\r\nwhen somebody entered the passage as far as the chink of the parlour\r\ndoor, and tapped.  This proceeding was probably adopted to kindly avoid\r\ngiving trouble to Susan, the neighbour\'s pink daughter, who helped at\r\nMrs. Garland\'s in the mornings, but was at that moment particularly\r\noccupied in standing on the water-butt and gazing at the soldiers, with\r\nan inhaling position of the mouth and circular eyes.\r\n\r\nThere was a flutter in the little dining-room--the sensitiveness of\r\nhabitual solitude makes hearts beat for preternaturally small reasons--and\r\na guessing as to who the visitor might be.  It was some military\r\ngentleman from the camp perhaps?  No; that was impossible.  It was the\r\nparson?  No; he would not come at dinner-time.  It was the well-informed\r\nman who travelled with drapery and the best Birmingham earrings?  Not at\r\nall; his time was not till Thursday at three.  Before they could think\r\nfurther the visitor moved forward another step, and the diners got a\r\nglimpse of him through the same friendly chink that had afforded him a\r\nview of the Garland dinner-table.\r\n\r\n\'O!  It is only Loveday.\'\r\n\r\nThis approximation to nobody was the miller above mentioned, a hale man\r\nof fifty-five or sixty--hale all through, as many were in those days, and\r\nnot merely veneered with purple by exhilarating victuals and drinks,\r\nthough the latter were not at all despised by him.  His face was indeed\r\nrather pale than otherwise, for he had just come from the mill.  It was\r\ncapable of immense changes of expression: mobility was its essence, a\r\nroll of flesh forming a buttress to his nose on each side, and a deep\r\nravine lying between his lower lip and the tumulus represented by his\r\nchin.  These fleshy lumps moved stealthily, as if of their own accord,\r\nwhenever his fancy was tickled.\r\n\r\nHis eyes having lighted on the table-cloth, plates, and viands, he found\r\nhimself in a position which had a sensible awkwardness for a modest man\r\nwho always liked to enter only at seasonable times the presence of a girl\r\nof such pleasantly soft ways as Anne Garland, she who could make apples\r\nseem like peaches, and throw over her shillings the glamour of guineas\r\nwhen she paid him for flour.\r\n\r\n\'Dinner is over, neighbour Loveday; please come in,\' said the widow,\r\nseeing his case.  The miller said something about coming in presently;\r\nbut Anne pressed him to stay, with a tender motion of her lip as it\r\nplayed on the verge of a solicitous smile without quite lapsing into\r\none--her habitual manner when speaking.\r\n\r\nLoveday took off his low-crowned hat and advanced.  He had not come about\r\npigs or fowls this time.  \'You have been looking out, like the rest o\'\r\nus, no doubt, Mrs. Garland, at the mampus of soldiers that have come upon\r\nthe down?  Well, one of the horse regiments is the --th Dragoons, my son\r\nJohn\'s regiment, you know.\'\r\n\r\nThe announcement, though it interested them, did not create such an\r\neffect as the father of John had seemed to anticipate; but Anne, who\r\nliked to say pleasant things, replied, \'The dragoons looked nicer than\r\nthe foot, or the German cavalry either.\'\r\n\r\n\'They are a handsome body of men,\' said the miller in a disinterested\r\nvoice.  \'Faith! I didn\'t know they were coming, though it may be in the\r\nnewspaper all the time.  But old Derriman keeps it so long that we never\r\nknow things till they be in everybody\'s mouth.\'\r\n\r\nThis Derriman was a squireen living near, who was chiefly distinguished\r\nin the present warlike time by having a nephew in the yeomanry.\r\n\r\n\'We were told that the yeomanry went along the turnpike road yesterday,\'\r\nsaid Anne; \'and they say that they were a pretty sight, and quite\r\nsoldierly.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah! well--they be not regulars,\' said Miller Loveday, keeping back\r\nharsher criticism as uncalled for.  But inflamed by the arrival of the\r\ndragoons, which had been the exciting cause of his call, his mind would\r\nnot go to yeomanry.  \'John has not been home these five years,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'And what rank does he hold now?\' said the widow.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s trumpet-major, ma\'am; and a good musician.\'  The miller, who was a\r\ngood father, went on to explain that John had seen some service, too.  He\r\nhad enlisted when the regiment was lying in this neighbourhood, more than\r\neleven years before, which put his father out of temper with him, as he\r\nhad wished him to follow on at the mill.  But as the lad had enlisted\r\nseriously, and as he had often said that he would be a soldier, the\r\nmiller had thought that he would let Jack take his chance in the\r\nprofession of his choice.\r\n\r\nLoveday had two sons, and the second was now brought into the\r\nconversation by a remark of Anne\'s that neither of them seemed to care\r\nfor the miller\'s business.\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said Loveday in a less buoyant tone.  \'Robert, you see, must needs\r\ngo to sea.\'\r\n\r\n\'He is much younger than his brother?\' said Mrs. Garland.\r\n\r\nAbout four years, the miller told her.  His soldier son was\r\ntwo-and-thirty, and Bob was twenty-eight.  When Bob returned from his\r\npresent voyage, he was to be persuaded to stay and assist as grinder in\r\nthe mill, and go to sea no more.\r\n\r\n\'A sailor-miller!\' said Anne.\r\n\r\n\'O, he knows as much about mill business as I do,\' said Loveday; \'he was\r\nintended for it, you know, like John.  But, bless me!\' he continued, \'I\r\nam before my story.  I\'m come more particularly to ask you, ma\'am, and\r\nyou, Anne my honey, if you will join me and a few friends at a leetle\r\nhomely supper that I shall gi\'e to please the chap now he\'s come?  I can\r\ndo no less than have a bit of a randy, as the saying is, now that he\'s\r\nhere safe and sound.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Garland wanted to catch her daughter\'s eye; she was in some doubt\r\nabout her answer.  But Anne\'s eye was not to be caught, for she hated\r\nhints, nods, and calculations of any kind in matters which should be\r\nregulated by impulse; and the matron replied, \'If so be \'tis possible,\r\nwe\'ll be there.  You will tell us the day?\'\r\n\r\nHe would, as soon as he had seen son John.  \'\'Twill be rather untidy, you\r\nknow, owing to my having no womenfolks in the house; and my man David is\r\na poor dunder-headed feller for getting up a feast.  Poor chap! his sight\r\nis bad, that\'s true, and he\'s very good at making the beds, and oiling\r\nthe legs of the chairs and other furniture, or I should have got rid of\r\nhim years ago.\'\r\n\r\n\'You should have a woman to attend to the house, Loveday,\' said the\r\nwidow.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I should, but--.  Well, \'tis a fine day, neighbours.  Hark!  I\r\nfancy I hear the noise of pots and pans up at the camp, or my ears\r\ndeceive me.  Poor fellows, they must be hungry!  Good day t\'ye, ma\'am.\'\r\nAnd the miller went away.\r\n\r\nAll that afternoon Overcombe continued in a ferment of interest in the\r\nmilitary investment, which brought the excitement of an invasion without\r\nthe strife.  There were great discussions on the merits and appearance of\r\nthe soldiery.  The event opened up, to the girls unbounded possibilities\r\nof adoring and being adored, and to the young men an embarrassment of\r\ndashing acquaintances which quite superseded falling in love.  Thirteen\r\nof these lads incontinently stated within the space of a quarter of an\r\nhour that there was nothing in the world like going for a soldier.  The\r\nyoung women stated little, but perhaps thought the more; though, in\r\njustice, they glanced round towards the encampment from the corners of\r\ntheir blue and brown eyes in the most demure and modest manner that could\r\nbe desired.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the village was lively with soldiers\' wives; a tree full\r\nof starlings would not have rivalled the chatter that was going on.  These\r\nladies were very brilliantly dressed, with more regard for colour than\r\nfor material.  Purple, red, and blue bonnets were numerous, with bunches\r\nof cocks\' feathers; and one had on an Arcadian hat of green sarcenet,\r\nturned up in front to show her cap underneath.  It had once belonged to\r\nan officer\'s lady, and was not so much stained, except where the\r\noccasional storms of rain, incidental to a military life, had caused the\r\ngreen to run and stagnate in curious watermarks like peninsulas and\r\nislands.  Some of the prettiest of these butterfly wives had been\r\nfortunate enough to get lodgings in the cottages, and were thus spared\r\nthe necessity of living in huts and tents on the down.  Those who had not\r\nbeen so fortunate were not rendered more amiable by the success of their\r\nsisters-in-arms, and called them names which brought forth retorts and\r\nrejoinders; till the end of these alternative remarks seemed dependent\r\nupon the close of the day.\r\n\r\nOne of these new arrivals, who had a rosy nose and a slight thickness of\r\nvoice, which, as Anne said, she couldn\'t help, poor thing, seemed to have\r\nseen so much of the world, and to have been in so many campaigns, that\r\nAnne would have liked to take her into their own house, so as to acquire\r\nsome of that practical knowledge of the history of England which the lady\r\npossessed, and which could not be got from books.  But the narrowness of\r\nMrs. Garland\'s rooms absolutely forbade this, and the houseless treasury\r\nof experience was obliged to look for quarters elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThat night Anne retired early to bed.  The events of the day, cheerful as\r\nthey were in themselves, had been unusual enough to give her a slight\r\nheadache.  Before getting into bed she went to the window, and lifted the\r\nwhite curtains that hung across it.  The moon was shining, though not as\r\nyet into the valley, but just peeping above the ridge of the down, where\r\nthe white cones of the encampment were softly touched by its light.  The\r\nquarter-guard and foremost tents showed themselves prominently; but the\r\nbody of the camp, the officers\' tents, kitchens, canteen, and\r\nappurtenances in the rear were blotted out by the ground, because of its\r\nheight above her.  She could discern the forms of one or two sentries\r\nmoving to and fro across the disc of the moon at intervals.  She could\r\nhear the frequent shuffling and tossing of the horses tied to the\r\npickets; and in the other direction the miles-long voice of the sea,\r\nwhispering a louder note at those points of its length where hampered in\r\nits ebb and flow by some jutting promontory or group of boulders.  Louder\r\nsounds suddenly broke this approach to silence; they came from the camp\r\nof dragoons, were taken up further to the right by the camp of the\r\nHanoverians, and further on still by the body of infantry.  It was\r\ntattoo.  Feeling no desire to sleep, she listened yet longer, looked at\r\nCharles\'s Wain swinging over the church tower, and the moon ascending\r\nhigher and higher over the right-hand streets of tents, where, instead of\r\nparade and bustle, there was nothing going on but snores and dreams, the\r\ntired soldiers lying by this time under their proper canvases, radiating\r\nlike spokes from the pole of each tent.\r\n\r\nAt last Anne gave up thinking, and retired like the rest.  The night wore\r\non, and, except the occasional \'All\'s well\' of the sentries, no voice was\r\nheard in the camp or in the village below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.  THE MILL BECOMES AN IMPORTANT CENTRE OF OPERATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning Miss Garland awoke with an impression that something\r\nmore than usual was going on, and she recognized as soon as she could\r\nclearly reason that the proceedings, whatever they might be, lay not far\r\naway from her bedroom window.  The sounds were chiefly those of pickaxes\r\nand shovels.  Anne got up, and, lifting the corner of the curtain about\r\nan inch, peeped out.\r\n\r\nA number of soldiers were busily engaged in making a zigzag path down the\r\nincline from the camp to the river-head at the back of the house, and\r\njudging from the quantity of work already got through they must have\r\nbegun very early.  Squads of men were working at several equidistant\r\npoints in the proposed pathway, and by the time that Anne had dressed\r\nherself each section of the length had been connected with those above\r\nand below it, so that a continuous and easy track was formed from the\r\ncrest of the down to the bottom of the steep.\r\n\r\nThe down rested on a bed of solid chalk, and the surface exposed by the\r\nroadmakers formed a white ribbon, serpenting from top to bottom.\r\n\r\nThen the relays of working soldiers all disappeared, and, not long after,\r\na troop of dragoons in watering order rode forward at the top and began\r\nto wind down the new path.  They came lower and closer, and at last were\r\nimmediately beneath her window, gathering themselves up on the space by\r\nthe mill-pond.  A number of the horses entered it at the shallow part,\r\ndrinking and splashing and tossing about.  Perhaps as many as thirty,\r\nhalf of them with riders on their backs, were in the water at one time;\r\nthe thirsty animals drank, stamped, flounced, and drank again, letting\r\nthe clear, cool water dribble luxuriously from their mouths.  Miller\r\nLoveday was looking on from over his garden hedge, and many admiring\r\nvillagers were gathered around.\r\n\r\nGazing up higher, Anne saw other troops descending by the new road from\r\nthe camp, those which had already been to the pond making room for these\r\nby withdrawing along the village lane and returning to the top by a\r\ncircuitous route.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the miller exclaimed, as in fulfilment of expectation, \'Ah,\r\nJohn, my boy; good morning!\'  And the reply of \'Morning, father,\' came\r\nfrom a well-mounted soldier near him, who did not, however, form one of\r\nthe watering party.  Anne could not see his face very clearly, but she\r\nhad no doubt that this was John Loveday.\r\n\r\nThere were tones in the voice which reminded her of old times, those of\r\nher very infancy, when Johnny Loveday had been top boy in the village\r\nschool, and had wanted to learn painting of her father.  The deeps and\r\nshallows of the mill-pond being better known to him than to any other man\r\nin the camp, he had apparently come down on that account, and was\r\ncautioning some of the horsemen against riding too far in towards the\r\nmill-head.\r\n\r\nSince her childhood and his enlistment Anne had seen him only once, and\r\nthen but casually, when he was home on a short furlough.  His figure was\r\nnot much changed from what it had been; but the many sunrises and sunsets\r\nwhich had passed since that day, developing her from a comparative child\r\nto womanhood, had abstracted some of his angularities, reddened his skin,\r\nand given him a foreign look.  It was interesting to see what years of\r\ntraining and service had done for this man.  Few would have supposed that\r\nthe white and the blue coats of miller and soldier covered the forms of\r\nfather and son.\r\n\r\nBefore the last troop of dragoons rode off they were welcomed in a body\r\nby Miller Loveday, who still stood in his outer garden, this being a plot\r\nlying below the mill-tail, and stretching to the water-side.  It was just\r\nthe time of year when cherries are ripe, and hang in clusters under their\r\ndark leaves.  While the troopers loitered on their horses, and chatted to\r\nthe miller across the stream, he gathered bunches of the fruit, and held\r\nthem up over the garden hedge for the acceptance of anybody who would\r\nhave them; whereupon the soldiers rode into the water to where it had\r\nwashed holes in the garden bank, and, reining their horses there, caught\r\nthe cherries in their forage-caps, or received bunches of them on the\r\nends of their switches, with the dignified laugh that became martial men\r\nwhen stooping to slightly boyish amusement.  It was a cheerful, careless,\r\nunpremeditated half-hour, which returned like the scent of a flower to\r\nthe memories of some of those who enjoyed it, even at a distance of many\r\nyears after, when they lay wounded and weak in foreign lands.\r\n\r\nThen dragoons and horses wheeled off as the others had done; and troops\r\nof the German Legion next came down and entered in panoramic procession\r\nthe space below Anne\'s eyes, as if on purpose to gratify her.  These were\r\nnotable by their mustachios, and queues wound tightly with brown ribbon\r\nto the level of their broad shoulder-blades.  They were charmed, as the\r\nothers had been, by the head and neck of Miss Garland in the little\r\nsquare window overlooking the scene of operations, and saluted her with\r\ndevoted foreign civility, and in such overwhelming numbers that the\r\nmodest girl suddenly withdrew herself into the room, and had a private\r\nblush between the chest of drawers and the washing-stand.\r\n\r\nWhen she came downstairs her mother said, \'I have been thinking what I\r\nought to wear to Miller Loveday\'s to-night.\'\r\n\r\n\'To Miller Loveday\'s?\' said Anne.\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  The party is to-night.  He has been in here this morning to tell\r\nme that he has seen his son, and they have fixed this evening.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you think we ought to go, mother?\' said Anne slowly, and looking at\r\nthe smaller features of the window-flowers.\r\n\r\n\'Why not?\' said Mrs. Garland.\r\n\r\n\'He will only have men there except ourselves, will he?  And shall we be\r\nright to go alone among \'em?\'\r\n\r\nAnne had not recovered from the ardent gaze of the gallant York Hussars,\r\nwhose voices reached her even now in converse with Loveday.\r\n\r\n\'La, Anne, how proud you are!\' said Widow Garland.  \'Why, isn\'t he our\r\nnearest neighbour and our landlord? and don\'t he always fetch our faggots\r\nfrom the wood, and keep us in vegetables for next to nothing?\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s true,\' said Anne.\r\n\r\n\'Well, we can\'t be distant with the man.  And if the enemy land next\r\nautumn, as everybody says they will, we shall have quite to depend upon\r\nthe miller\'s waggon and horses.  He\'s our only friend.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, so he is,\' said Anne.  \'And you had better go, mother; and I\'ll\r\nstay at home.  They will be all men; and I don\'t like going.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Garland reflected.  \'Well, if you don\'t want to go, I don\'t,\' she\r\nsaid.  \'Perhaps, as you are growing up, it would be better to stay at\r\nhome this time.  Your father was a professional man, certainly.\'  Having\r\nspoken as a mother, she sighed as a woman.\r\n\r\n\'Why do you sigh, mother?\'\r\n\r\n\'You are so prim and stiff about everything.\'\r\n\r\n\'Very well--we\'ll go.\'\r\n\r\n\'O no--I am not sure that we ought.  I did not promise, and there will be\r\nno trouble in keeping away.\'\r\n\r\nAnne apparently did not feel certain of her own opinion, and, instead of\r\nsupporting or contradicting, looked thoughtfully down, and abstractedly\r\nbrought her hands together on her bosom, till her fingers met tip to tip.\r\n\r\nAs the day advanced the young woman and her mother became aware that\r\ngreat preparations were in progress in the miller\'s wing of the house.\r\nThe partitioning between the Lovedays and the Garlands was not very\r\nthorough, consisting in many cases of a simple screwing up of the doors\r\nin the dividing walls; and thus when the mill began any new performances\r\nthey proclaimed themselves at once in the more private dwelling.  The\r\nsmell of Miller Loveday\'s pipe came down Mrs. Garland\'s chimney of an\r\nevening with the greatest regularity.  Every time that he poked his fire\r\nthey knew from the vehemence or deliberateness of the blows the precise\r\nstate of his mind; and when he wound his clock on Sunday nights the whirr\r\nof that monitor reminded the widow to wind hers.  This transit of noises\r\nwas most perfect where Loveday\'s lobby adjoined Mrs. Garland\'s pantry;\r\nand Anne, who was occupied for some time in the latter apartment, enjoyed\r\nthe privilege of hearing the visitors arrive and of catching stray sounds\r\nand words without the connecting phrases that made them entertaining, to\r\njudge from the laughter they evoked.  The arrivals passed through the\r\nhouse and went into the garden, where they had tea in a large\r\nsummer-house, an occasional blink of bright colour, through the foliage,\r\nbeing all that was visible of the assembly from Mrs. Garland\'s windows.\r\nWhen it grew dusk they all could be heard coming indoors to finish the\r\nevening in the parlour.\r\n\r\nThen there was an intensified continuation of the above-mentioned signs\r\nof enjoyment, talkings and haw-haws, runnings upstairs and runnings down,\r\na slamming of doors and a clinking of cups and glasses; till the proudest\r\nadjoining tenant without friends on his own side of the partition might\r\nhave been tempted to wish for entrance to that merry dwelling, if only to\r\nknow the cause of these fluctuations of hilarity, and to see if the\r\nguests were really so numerous, and the observations so very amusing as\r\nthey seemed.\r\n\r\nThe stagnation of life on the Garland side of the party-wall began to\r\nhave a very gloomy effect by the contrast.  When, about half-past nine\r\no\'clock, one of these tantalizing bursts of gaiety had resounded for a\r\nlonger time than usual, Anne said, \'I believe, mother, that you are\r\nwishing you had gone.\'\r\n\r\n\'I own to feeling that it would have been very cheerful if we had joined\r\nin,\' said Mrs. Garland, in a hankering tone.  \'I was rather too nice in\r\nlistening to you and not going.  The parson never calls upon us except in\r\nhis spiritual capacity.  Old Derriman is hardly genteel; and there\'s\r\nnobody left to speak to.  Lonely people must accept what company they can\r\nget.\'\r\n\r\n\'Or do without it altogether.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s not natural, Anne; and I am surprised to hear a young woman like\r\nyou say such a thing.  Nature will not be stifled in that way. . . .\'\r\n(Song and powerful chorus heard through partition.)  \'I declare the room\r\non the other side of the wall seems quite a paradise compared with this.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mother, you are quite a girl,\' said Anne in slightly superior accents.\r\n\'Go in and join them by all means.\'\r\n\r\n\'O no--not now,\' said her mother, resignedly shaking her head.  \'It is\r\ntoo late now.  We ought to have taken advantage of the invitation.  They\r\nwould look hard at me as a poor mortal who had no real business there,\r\nand the miller would say, with his broad smile, "Ah, you be obliged to\r\ncome round."\'\r\n\r\nWhile the sociable and unaspiring Mrs. Garland continued thus to pass the\r\nevening in two places, her body in her own house and her mind in the\r\nmiller\'s, somebody knocked at the door, and directly after the elder\r\nLoveday himself was admitted to the room.  He was dressed in a suit\r\nbetween grand and gay, which he used for such occasions as the present,\r\nand his blue coat, yellow and red waistcoat with the three lower buttons\r\nunfastened, steel-buckled shoes and speckled stockings, became him very\r\nwell in Mrs. Martha Garland\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n\'Your servant, ma\'am,\' said the miller, adopting as a matter of propriety\r\nthe raised standard of politeness required by his higher costume.  \'Now,\r\nbegging your pardon, I can\'t hae this.  \'Tis unnatural that you two\r\nladies should be biding here and we under the same roof making merry\r\nwithout ye.  Your husband, poor man--lovely picters that a\' would make to\r\nbe sure--would have been in with us long ago if he had been in your\r\nplace.  I can take no nay from ye, upon my honour.  You and maidy Anne\r\nmust come in, if it be only for half-an-hour.  John and his friends have\r\ngot passes till twelve o\'clock to-night, and, saving a few of our own\r\nvillage folk, the lowest visitor present is a very genteel German\r\ncorporal.  If you should hae any misgivings on the score of\r\nrespectability, ma\'am, we\'ll pack off the underbred ones into the back\r\nkitchen.\'\r\n\r\nWidow Garland and Anne looked yes at each other after this appeal.\r\n\r\n\'We\'ll follow you in a few minutes,\' said the elder, smiling; and she\r\nrose with Anne to go upstairs.\r\n\r\n\'No, I\'ll wait for ye,\' said the miller doggedly; \'or perhaps you\'ll\r\nalter your mind again.\'\r\n\r\nWhile the mother and daughter were upstairs dressing, and saying\r\nlaughingly to each other, \'Well, we must go now,\' as if they hadn\'t\r\nwished to go all the evening, other steps were heard in the passage; and\r\nthe miller cried from below, \'Your pardon, Mrs. Garland; but my son John\r\nhas come to help fetch ye.  Shall I ask him in till ye be ready?\'\r\n\r\n\'Certainly; I shall be down in a minute,\' screamed Anne\'s mother in a\r\nslanting voice towards the staircase.\r\n\r\nWhen she descended, the outline of the trumpet-major appeared half-way\r\ndown the passage.  \'This is John,\' said the miller simply.  \'John, you\r\ncan mind Mrs. Martha Garland very well?\'\r\n\r\n\'Very well, indeed,\' said the dragoon, coming in a little further.  \'I\r\nshould have called to see her last time, but I was only home a week.  How\r\nis your little girl, ma\'am?\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Garland said Anne was quite well.  \'She is grown-up now.  She will\r\nbe down in a moment.\'\r\n\r\nThere was a slight noise of military heels without the door, at which the\r\ntrumpet-major went and put his head outside, and said, \'All right--coming\r\nin a minute,\' when voices in the darkness replied, \'No hurry.\'\r\n\r\n\'More friends?\' said Mrs. Garland.\r\n\r\n\'O, it is only Buck and Jones come to fetch me,\' said the soldier.  \'Shall\r\nI ask \'em in a minute, Mrs Garland, ma\'am?\'\r\n\r\n\'O yes,\' said the lady; and the two interesting forms of Trumpeter Buck\r\nand Saddler-sergeant Jones then came forward in the most friendly manner;\r\nwhereupon other steps were heard without, and it was discovered that\r\nSergeant-master-tailor Brett and Farrier-extraordinary Johnson were\r\noutside, having come to fetch Messrs. Buck and Jones, as Buck and Jones\r\nhad come to fetch the trumpet-major.\r\n\r\nAs there seemed a possibility of Mrs. Garland\'s small passage being\r\nchoked up with human figures personally unknown to her, she was relieved\r\nto hear Anne coming downstairs.\r\n\r\n\'Here\'s my little girl,\' said Mrs. Garland, and the trumpet-major looked\r\nwith a sort of awe upon the muslin apparition who came forward, and stood\r\nquite dumb before her.  Anne recognized him as the trooper she had seen\r\nfrom her window, and welcomed him kindly.  There was something in his\r\nhonest face which made her feel instantly at home with him.\r\n\r\nAt this frankness of manner Loveday--who was not a ladies\' man--blushed,\r\nand made some alteration in his bodily posture, began a sentence which\r\nhad no end, and showed quite a boy\'s embarrassment.  Recovering himself,\r\nhe politely offered his arm, which Anne took with a very pretty grace.  He\r\nconducted her through his comrades, who glued themselves perpendicularly\r\nto the wall to let her pass, and then they went out of the door, her\r\nmother following with the miller, and supported by the body of troopers,\r\nthe latter walking with the usual cavalry gait, as if their thighs were\r\nrather too long for them.  Thus they crossed the threshold of the mill-\r\nhouse and up the passage, the paving of which was worn into a gutter by\r\nthe ebb and flow of feet that had been going on there ever since Tudor\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.  WHO WERE PRESENT AT THE MILLER\'S LITTLE ENTERTAINMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the group entered the presence of the company a lull in the\r\nconversation was caused by the sight of new visitors, and (of course) by\r\nthe charm of Anne\'s appearance; until the old men, who had daughters of\r\ntheir own, perceiving that she was only a half-formed girl, resumed their\r\ntales and toss-potting with unconcern.\r\n\r\nMiller Loveday had fraternized with half the soldiers in the camp since\r\ntheir arrival, and the effect of this upon his party was striking--both\r\nchromatically and otherwise.  Those among the guests who first attracted\r\nthe eye were the sergeants and sergeant-majors of Loveday\'s regiment,\r\nfine hearty men, who sat facing the candles, entirely resigned to\r\nphysical comfort.  Then there were other non-commissioned officers, a\r\nGerman, two Hungarians, and a Swede, from the foreign hussars--young men\r\nwith a look of sadness on their faces, as if they did not much like\r\nserving so far from home.  All of them spoke English fairly well.  Old\r\nage was represented by Simon Burden the pensioner, and the shady side of\r\nfifty by Corporal Tullidge, his friend and neighbour, who was hard of\r\nhearing, and sat with his hat on over a red cotton handkerchief that was\r\nwound several times round his head.  These two veterans were employed as\r\nwatchers at the neighbouring beacon, which had lately been erected by the\r\nLord-Lieutenant for firing whenever the descent on the coast should be\r\nmade.  They lived in a little hut on the hill, close by the heap of\r\nfaggots; but to-night they had found deputies to watch in their stead.\r\n\r\nOn a lower plane of experience and qualifications came neighbour James\r\nComfort, of the Volunteers, a soldier by courtesy, but a blacksmith by\r\nrights; also William Tremlett and Anthony Cripplestraw, of the local\r\nforces.  The two latter men of war were dressed merely as villagers, and\r\nlooked upon the regulars from a humble position in the background.  The\r\nremainder of the party was made up of a neighbouring dairyman or two, and\r\ntheir wives, invited by the miller, as Anne was glad to see, that she and\r\nher mother should not be the only women there.\r\n\r\nThe elder Loveday apologized in a whisper to Mrs. Garland for the\r\npresence of the inferior villagers.  \'But as they are learning to be\r\nbrave defenders of their home and country, ma\'am, as fast as they can\r\nmaster the drill, and have worked for me off and on these many years,\r\nI\'ve asked \'em in, and thought you\'d excuse it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Certainly, Miller Loveday,\' said the widow.\r\n\r\n\'And the same of old Burden and Tullidge.  They have served well and long\r\nin the Foot, and even now have a hard time of it up at the beacon in wet\r\nweather.  So after giving them a meal in the kitchen I just asked \'em in\r\nto hear the singing.  They faithfully promise that as soon as ever the\r\ngunboats appear in view, and they have fired the beacon, to run down here\r\nfirst, in case we shouldn\'t see it.  \'Tis worth while to be friendly with\r\n\'em, you see, though their tempers be queer.\'\r\n\r\n\'Quite worth while, miller,\' said she.\r\n\r\nAnne was rather embarrassed by the presence of the regular military in\r\nsuch force, and at first confined her words to the dairymen\'s wives she\r\nwas acquainted with, and to the two old soldiers of the parish.\r\n\r\n\'Why didn\'t ye speak to me afore, chiel?\' said one of these, Corporal\r\nTullidge, the elderly man with the hat, while she was talking to old\r\nSimon Burden.  \'I met ye in the lane yesterday,\' he added reproachfully,\r\n\'but ye didn\'t notice me at all.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am very sorry for it,\' she said; but, being afraid to shout in such a\r\ncompany, the effect of her remark upon the corporal was as if she had not\r\nspoken at all.\r\n\r\n\'You was coming along with yer head full of some high notions or other no\r\ndoubt,\' continued the uncompromising corporal in the same loud voice.\r\n\'Ah, \'tis the young bucks that get all the notice nowadays, and old folks\r\nare quite forgot!  I can mind well enough how young Bob Loveday used to\r\nlie in wait for ye.\'\r\n\r\nAnne blushed deeply, and stopped his too excursive discourse by hastily\r\nsaying that she always respected old folks like him.  The corporal\r\nthought she inquired why he always kept his hat on, and answered that it\r\nwas because his head was injured at Valenciennes, in July, Ninety-three.\r\n\'We were trying to bomb down the tower, and a piece of the shell struck\r\nme.  I was no more nor less than a dead man for two days.  If it hadn\'t a\r\nbeen for that and my smashed arm I should have come home none the worse\r\nfor my five-and-twenty years\' service.\'\r\n\r\n\'You have got a silver plate let into yer head, haven\'t ye, corpel?\' said\r\nAnthony Cripplestraw, who had drawn near.  \'I have heard that the way\r\nthey morticed yer skull was a beautiful piece of workmanship.  Perhaps\r\nthe young woman would like to see the place?  \'Tis a curious sight,\r\nMis\'ess Anne; you don\'t see such a wownd every day.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, thank you,\' said Anne hurriedly, dreading, as did all the young\r\npeople of Overcombe, the spectacle of the corporal uncovered.  He had\r\nnever been seen in public without the hat and the handkerchief since his\r\nreturn in Ninety-four; and strange stories were told of the ghastliness\r\nof his appearance bare-headed, a little boy who had accidentally beheld\r\nhim going to bed in that state having been frightened into fits.\r\n\r\n\'Well, if the young woman don\'t want to see yer head, maybe she\'d like to\r\nhear yer arm?\' continued Cripplestraw, earnest to please her.\r\n\r\n\'Hey?\' said the corporal.\r\n\r\n\'Your arm hurt too?\' cried Anne.\r\n\r\n\'Knocked to a pummy at the same time as my head,\' said Tullidge\r\ndispassionately.\r\n\r\n\'Rattle yer arm, corpel, and show her,\' said Cripplestraw.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sure,\' said the corporal, raising the limb slowly, as if the glory\r\nof exhibition had lost some of its novelty, though he was willing to\r\noblige.  Twisting it mercilessly about with his right hand he produced a\r\ncrunching among the bones at every motion, Cripplestraw seeming to derive\r\ngreat satisfaction from the ghastly sound.\r\n\r\n\'How very shocking!\' said Anne, painfully anxious for him to leave off.\r\n\r\n\'O, it don\'t hurt him, bless ye.  Do it, corpel?\' said Cripplestraw.\r\n\r\n\'Not a bit,\' said the corporal, still working his arm with great energy.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s no life in the bones at all.  No life in \'em, I tell her,\r\ncorpel!\'\r\n\r\n\'None at all.\'\r\n\r\n\'They be as loose as a bag of ninepins,\' explained Cripplestraw in\r\ncontinuation.  \'You can feel \'em quite plain, Mis\'ess Anne.  If ye would\r\nlike to, he\'ll undo his sleeve in a minute to oblege ye?\'\r\n\r\n\'O no, no, please not!  I quite understand,\' said the young woman.\r\n\r\n\'Do she want to hear or see any more, or don\'t she?\' the corporal\r\ninquired, with a sense that his time was getting wasted.\r\n\r\nAnne explained that she did not on any account; and managed to escape\r\nfrom the corner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.  THE SONG AND THE STRANGER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trumpet-major now contrived to place himself near her, Anne\'s\r\npresence having evidently been a great pleasure to him since the moment\r\nof his first seeing her.  She was quite at her ease with him, and asked\r\nhim if he thought that Buonaparte would really come during the summer,\r\nand many other questions which the gallant dragoon could not answer, but\r\nwhich he nevertheless liked to be asked.  William Tremlett, who had not\r\nenjoyed a sound night\'s rest since the First Consul\'s menace had become\r\nknown, pricked up his ears at sound of this subject, and inquired if\r\nanybody had seen the terrible flat-bottomed boats that the enemy were to\r\ncross in.\r\n\r\n\'My brother Robert saw several of them paddling about the shore the last\r\ntime he passed the Straits of Dover,\' said the trumpet-major; and he\r\nfurther startled the company by informing them that there were supposed\r\nto be more than fifteen hundred of these boats, and that they would carry\r\na hundred men apiece.  So that a descent of one hundred and fifty\r\nthousand men might be expected any day as soon as Boney had brought his\r\nplans to bear.\r\n\r\n\'Lord ha\' mercy upon us!\' said William Tremlett.\r\n\r\n\'The night-time is when they will try it, if they try it at all,\' said\r\nold Tullidge, in the tone of one whose watch at the beacon must, in the\r\nnature of things, have given him comprehensive views of the situation.\r\n\'It is my belief that the point they will choose for making the shore is\r\njust over there,\' and he nodded with indifference towards a section of\r\nthe coast at a hideous nearness to the house in which they were\r\nassembled, whereupon Fencible Tremlett, and Cripplestraw of the Locals,\r\ntried to show no signs of trepidation.\r\n\r\n\'When d\'ye think \'twill be?\' said Volunteer Comfort, the blacksmith.\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t answer to a day,\' said the corporal, \'but it will certainly be\r\nin a down-channel tide; and instead of pulling hard against it, he\'ll let\r\nhis boats drift, and that will bring \'em right into Budmouth Bay.  \'Twill\r\nbe a beautiful stroke of war, if so be \'tis quietly done!\'\r\n\r\n\'Beautiful,\' said Cripplestraw, moving inside his clothes.  \'But how if\r\nwe should be all abed, corpel?  You can\'t expect a man to be brave in his\r\nshirt, especially we Locals, that have only got so far as shoulder fire-\r\nlocks.\'\r\n\r\n\'He\'s not coming this summer.  He\'ll never come at all,\' said a tall\r\nsergeant-major decisively.\r\n\r\nLoveday the soldier was too much engaged in attending upon Anne and her\r\nmother to join in these surmises, bestirring himself to get the ladies\r\nsome of the best liquor the house afforded, which had, as a matter of\r\nfact, crossed the Channel as privately as Buonaparte wished his army to\r\ndo, and had been landed on a dark night over the cliff.  After this he\r\nasked Anne to sing, but though she had a very pretty voice in private\r\nperformances of that nature, she declined to oblige him; turning the\r\nsubject by making a hesitating inquiry about his brother Robert, whom he\r\nhad mentioned just before.\r\n\r\n\'Robert is as well as ever, thank you, Miss Garland,\' he said.  \'He is\r\nnow mate of the brig Pewit--rather young for such a command; but the\r\nowner puts great trust in him.\'  The trumpet-major added, deepening his\r\nthoughts to a profounder view of the person discussed, \'Bob is in love.\'\r\n\r\nAnne looked conscious, and listened attentively; but Loveday did not go\r\non.\r\n\r\n\'Much?\' she asked.\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t exactly say.  And the strange part of it is that he never tells\r\nus who the woman is.  Nobody knows at all.\'\r\n\r\n\'He will tell, of course?\' said Anne, in the remote tone of a person with\r\nwhose sex such matters had no connexion whatever.\r\n\r\nLoveday shook his head, and the tete-a-tete was put an end to by a burst\r\nof singing from one of the sergeants, who was followed at the end of his\r\nsong by others, each giving a ditty in his turn; the singer standing up\r\nin front of the table, stretching his chin well into the air, as though\r\nto abstract every possible wrinkle from his throat, and then plunging\r\ninto the melody.  When this was over one of the foreign hussars--the\r\ngenteel German of Miller Loveday\'s description, who called himself a\r\nHungarian, and in reality belonged to no definite country--performed at\r\nTrumpet-major Loveday\'s request the series of wild motions that he\r\ndenominated his national dance, that Anne might see what it was like.\r\nMiss Garland was the flower of the whole company; the soldiers one and\r\nall, foreign and English, seemed to be quite charmed by her presence, as\r\nindeed they well might be, considering how seldom they came into the\r\nsociety of such as she.\r\n\r\nAnne and her mother were just thinking of retiring to their own dwelling\r\nwhen Sergeant Stanner of the --th Foot, who was recruiting at Budmouth,\r\nbegan a satirical song:--\r\n\r\n   When law\'-yers strive\' to heal\' a breach\',\r\n   And par-sons prac\'-tise what\' they preach\';\r\n   Then lit\'-tle Bo-ney he\'ll pounce down\',\r\n   And march\' his men\' on Lon\'-don town\'!\r\n\r\n   Chorus.--Rol\'-li-cum ro\'-rum, tol\'-lol-lo\'-rum,\r\n         Rol\'-li-cum ro\'-rum, tol\'-lol-lay.\r\n\r\n   When jus\'-ti-ces\' hold e\'qual scales\',\r\n   And rogues\' are on\'-ly found\' in jails\';\r\n   Then lit\'tle Bo\'-ney he\'ll pounce down\',\r\n   And march\' his men\' on Lon\'-don town\'!\r\n\r\n   Chorus.--Rol\'-li-cum ro\'-rum, tol\'-lol-lo\'-rum,\r\n        Rol\'-li-cum ro\'-rum, tol\'-lol-lay.\r\n\r\n   When rich\' men find\' their wealth\' a curse\',\r\n   And fill\' there-with\' the poor\' man\'s purse\';\r\n   Then lit\'-tle Bo\'-ney he\'ll pounce down\',\r\n   And march\' his men\' on Lon\'-don town\'!\r\n\r\n   Chorus.--Rol\'-li-cum ro\'-rum, tol\'-lol-lo\'-rum,\r\n        Rol\'-li-cum ro\'-rum, tol\'-lol-lay.\r\n\r\nPoor Stanner! In spite of his satire, he fell at the bloody battle of\r\nAlbuera a few years after this pleasantly spent summer at the Georgian\r\nwatering-place, being mortally wounded and trampled down by a French\r\nhussar when the brigade was deploying into line under Beresford.\r\n\r\nWhile Miller Loveday was saying \'Well done, Mr. Stanner!\' at the close of\r\nthe thirteenth stanza, which seemed to be the last, and Mr. Stanner was\r\nmodestly expressing his regret that he could do no better, a stentorian\r\nvoice was heard outside the window shutter repeating,\r\n\r\n   Rol\'-li-cum ro\'-rum, tol\'-lol-lo\'-rum,\r\n   Rol\'-li-cum ro\'-rum, tol\'-lol-lay.\r\n\r\nThe company was silent in a moment at this reinforcement, and only the\r\nmilitary tried not to look surprised.  While all wondered who the singer\r\ncould be somebody entered the porch; the door opened, and in came a young\r\nman, about the size and weight of the Farnese Hercules, in the uniform of\r\nthe yeomanry cavalry.\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis young Squire Derriman, old Mr. Derriman\'s nephew,\' murmured voices\r\nin the background.\r\n\r\nWithout waiting to address anybody, or apparently seeing who were\r\ngathered there, the colossal man waved his cap above his head and went on\r\nin tones that shook the window-panes:--\r\n\r\n   When hus\'-bands with\' their wives\' agree\'.\r\n   And maids\' won\'t wed\' from mod\'-es-ty\',\r\n   Then lit\'-tle Bo\'-ney he\'ll pounce down\',\r\n   And march\' his men\' on Lon\'-don town\'!\r\n\r\n   Chorus.--Rol\'-li-cum ro\'-rum, tol\'-lol-lo\'-rum,\r\n         Rol\'-li-cum ro\'-rum, tol\'-lol-lay.\r\n\r\nIt was a verse which had been omitted by the gallant Stanner, out of\r\nrespect to the ladies.\r\n\r\nThe new-comer was red-haired and of florid complexion, and seemed full of\r\na conviction that his whim of entering must be their pleasure, which for\r\nthe moment it was.\r\n\r\n\'No ceremony, good men all,\' he said; \'I was passing by, and my ear was\r\ncaught by the singing.  I like singing; \'tis warming and cheering, and\r\nshall not be put down.  I should like to hear anybody say otherwise.\'\r\n\r\n\'Welcome, Master Derriman,\' said the miller, filling a glass and handing\r\nit to the yeoman.  \'Come all the way from quarters, then?  I hardly\r\nknowed ye in your soldier\'s clothes.  You\'d look more natural with a spud\r\nin your hand, sir.  I shouldn\'t ha\' known ye at all if I hadn\'t heard\r\nthat you were called out.\'\r\n\r\n\'More natural with a spud!--have a care, miller,\' said the young giant,\r\nthe fire of his complexion increasing to scarlet.  \'I don\'t mean anger,\r\nbut--but--a soldier\'s honour, you know!\'\r\n\r\nThe military in the background laughed a little, and the yeoman then for\r\nthe first time discovered that there were more regulars present than one.\r\nHe looked momentarily disconcerted, but expanded again to full assurance.\r\n\r\n\'Right, right, Master Derriman, no offence--\'twas only my joke,\' said the\r\ngenial miller.  \'Everybody\'s a soldier nowadays.  Drink a drap o\' this\r\ncordial, and don\'t mind words.\'\r\n\r\nThe young man drank without the least reluctance, and said, \'Yes, miller,\r\nI am called out.  \'Tis ticklish times for us soldiers now; we hold our\r\nlives in our hands--What are those fellows grinning at behind the\r\ntable?--I say, we do!\'\r\n\r\n\'Staying with your uncle at the farm for a day or two, Mr. Derriman?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no; as I told you, six mile off.  Billeted at Casterbridge.  But I\r\nhave to call and see the old, old--\'\r\n\r\n\'Gentleman?\'\r\n\r\n\'Gentleman!--no, skinflint.  He lives upon the sweepings of the barton;\r\nha, ha!\'  And the speaker\'s regular white teeth showed themselves like\r\nsnow in a Dutch cabbage.  \'Well, well, the profession of arms makes a man\r\nproof against all that.  I take things as I find \'em.\'\r\n\r\n\'Quite right, Master Derriman.  Another drop?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no.  I\'ll take no more than is good for me--no man should; so don\'t\r\ntempt me.\'\r\n\r\nThe yeoman then saw Anne, and by an unconscious gravitation went towards\r\nher and the other women, flinging a remark to John Loveday in passing.\r\n\'Ah, Loveday!  I heard you were come; in short, I come o\' purpose to see\r\nyou.  Glad to see you enjoying yourself at home again.\'\r\n\r\nThe trumpet-major replied civilly, though not without grimness, for he\r\nseemed hardly to like Derriman\'s motion towards Anne.\r\n\r\n\'Widow Garland\'s daughter!--yes, \'tis! surely.  You remember me?  I have\r\nbeen here before.  Festus Derriman, Yeomanry Cavalry.\'\r\n\r\nAnne gave a little curtsey.  \'I know your name is Festus--that\'s all.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, \'tis well known--especially latterly.\'  He dropped his voice to\r\nconfidence pitch.  \'I suppose your friends here are disturbed by my\r\ncoming in, as they don\'t seem to talk much?  I don\'t mean to interrupt\r\nthe party; but I often find that people are put out by my coming among\r\n\'em, especially when I\'ve got my regimentals on.\'\r\n\r\n\'La! and are they?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; \'tis the way I have.\'  He further lowered his tone, as if they had\r\nbeen old friends, though in reality he had only seen her three or four\r\ntimes.  \'And how did you come to be here?  Dash my wig, I don\'t like to\r\nsee a nice young lady like you in this company.  You should come to some\r\nof our yeomanry sprees in Casterbridge or Shottsford-Forum.  O, but the\r\ngirls do come!  The yeomanry are respected men, men of good substantial\r\nfamilies, many farming their own land; and every one among us rides his\r\nown charger, which is more than these cussed fellows do.\'  He nodded\r\ntowards the dragoons.\r\n\r\n\'Hush, hush!  Why, these are friends and neighbours of Miller Loveday,\r\nand he is a great friend of ours--our best friend,\' said Anne with great\r\nemphasis, and reddening at the sense of injustice to their host.  \'What\r\nare you thinking of, talking like that?  It is ungenerous in you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ha, ha!  I\'ve affronted you.  Isn\'t that it, fair angel, fair--what do\r\nyou call it?--fair vestal?  Ah, well! would you was safe in my own house!\r\nBut honour must be minded now, not courting.  Rollicum-rorum, tol-lol-\r\nlorum.  Pardon me, my sweet, I like ye!  It may be a come down for me,\r\nowning land; but I do like ye.\'\r\n\r\n\'Sir, please be quiet,\' said Anne, distressed.\r\n\r\n\'I will, I will.  Well, Corporal Tullidge, how\'s your head?\' he said,\r\ngoing towards the other end of the room, and leaving Anne to herself.\r\n\r\nThe company had again recovered its liveliness, and it was a long time\r\nbefore the bouncing Rufus who had joined them could find heart to tear\r\nhimself away from their society and good liquors, although he had had\r\nquite enough of the latter before he entered.  The natives received him\r\nat his own valuation, and the soldiers of the camp, who sat beyond the\r\ntable, smiled behind their pipes at his remarks, with a pleasant twinkle\r\nof the eye which approached the satirical, John Loveday being not the\r\nleast conspicuous in this bearing.  But he and his friends were too\r\ncourteous on such an occasion as the present to challenge the young man\'s\r\nlarge remarks, and readily permitted him to set them right on the details\r\nof camping and other military routine, about which the troopers seemed\r\nwilling to let persons hold any opinion whatever, provided that they\r\nthemselves were not obliged to give attention to it; showing, strangely\r\nenough, that if there was one subject more than another which never\r\ninterested their minds, it was the art of war.  To them the art of\r\nenjoying good company in Overcombe Mill, the details of the miller\'s\r\nhousehold, the swarming of his bees, the number of his chickens, and the\r\nfatness of his pigs, were matters of infinitely greater concern.\r\n\r\nThe present writer, to whom this party has been described times out of\r\nnumber by members of the Loveday family and other aged people now passed\r\naway, can never enter the old living-room of Overcombe Mill without\r\nbeholding the genial scene through the mists of the seventy or eighty\r\nyears that intervene between then and now.  First and brightest to the\r\neye are the dozen candles, scattered about regardless of expense, and\r\nkept well snuffed by the miller, who walks round the room at intervals of\r\nfive minutes, snuffers in hand, and nips each wick with great precision,\r\nand with something of an executioner\'s grim look upon his face as he\r\ncloses the snuffers upon the neck of the candle.  Next to the\r\ncandle-light show the red and blue coats and white breeches of the\r\nsoldiers--nearly twenty of them in all besides the ponderous Derriman--the\r\nhead of the latter, and, indeed, the heads of all who are standing up,\r\nbeing in dangerous proximity to the black beams of the ceiling.  There is\r\nnot one among them who would attach any meaning to \'Vittoria,\' or gather\r\nfrom the syllables \'Waterloo\' the remotest idea of his own glory or\r\ndeath.  Next appears the correct and innocent Anne, little thinking what\r\nthings Time has in store for her at no great distance off.  She looks at\r\nDerriman with a half-uneasy smile as he clanks hither and thither, and\r\nhopes he will not single her out again to hold a private dialogue\r\nwith--which, however, he does, irresistibly attracted by the white muslin\r\nfigure.  She must, of course, look a little gracious again now, lest his\r\nmood should turn from sentimental to quarrelsome--no impossible\r\ncontingency with the yeoman-soldier, as her quick perception had noted.\r\n\r\n\'Well, well; this idling won\'t do for me, folks,\' he at last said, to\r\nAnne\'s relief.  \'I ought not to have come in, by rights; but I heard you\r\nenjoying yourselves, and thought it might be worth while to see what you\r\nwere up to; I have several miles to go before bedtime;\' and stretching\r\nhis arms, lifting his chin, and shaking his head, to eradicate any\r\nunseemly curve or wrinkle from his person, the yeoman wished them an off-\r\nhand good-night, and departed.\r\n\r\n\'You should have teased him a little more, father,\' said the\r\ntrumpet-major drily.  \'You could soon have made him as crabbed as a\r\nbear.\'\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t want to provoke the chap--\'twasn\'t worth while.  He came in\r\nfriendly enough,\' said the gentle miller without looking up.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think he was overmuch friendly,\' said John.\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis as well to be neighbourly with folks, if they be not quite\r\nonbearable,\' his father genially replied, as he took off his coat to go\r\nand draw more ale--this periodical stripping to the shirt-sleeves being\r\nnecessitated by the narrowness of the cellar and the smeary effect of its\r\nnumerous cobwebs upon best clothes.\r\n\r\nSome of the guests then spoke of Fess Derriman as not such a bad young\r\nman if you took him right and humoured him; others said that he was\r\nnobody\'s enemy but his own; and the elder ladies mentioned in a tone of\r\ninterest that he was likely to come into a deal of money at his uncle\'s\r\ndeath.  The person who did not praise was the one who knew him best, who\r\nhad known him as a boy years ago, when he had lived nearer to Overcombe\r\nthan he did at present.  This unappreciative person was the\r\ntrumpet-major.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.  OLD MR. DERRIMAN OF OXWELL HALL\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time in the history of Overcombe one solitary newspaper\r\noccasionally found its way into the village.  It was lent by the\r\npostmaster at Budmouth (who, in some mysterious way, got it for nothing\r\nthrough his connexion with the mail) to Mr. Derriman at the Hall, by whom\r\nit was handed on to Mrs. Garland when it was not more than a fortnight\r\nold.  Whoever remembers anything about the old farmer-squire will, of\r\ncourse, know well enough that this delightful privilege of reading\r\nhistory in long columns was not accorded to the Widow Garland for\r\nnothing.  It was by such ingenuous means that he paid her for her\r\ndaughter\'s occasional services in reading aloud to him and making out his\r\naccounts, in which matters the farmer, whose guineas were reported to\r\ntouch five figures--some said more--was not expert.\r\n\r\nMrs. Martha Garland, as a respectable widow, occupied a twilight rank\r\nbetween the benighted villagers and the well-informed gentry, and kindly\r\nmade herself useful to the former as letter-writer and reader, and\r\ngeneral translator from the printing tongue.  It was not without\r\nsatisfaction that she stood at her door of an evening, newspaper in hand,\r\nwith three or four cottagers standing round, and poured down their open\r\nthroats any paragraph that she might choose to select from the stirring\r\nones of the period.  When she had done with the sheet Mrs. Garland passed\r\nit on to the miller, the miller to the grinder, and the grinder to the\r\ngrinder\'s boy, in whose hands it became subdivided into half pages,\r\nquarter pages, and irregular triangles, and ended its career as a paper\r\ncap, a flagon bung, or a wrapper for his bread and cheese.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his compact with Mrs. Garland, old Mr. Derriman kept the\r\npaper so long, and was so chary of wasting his man\'s time on a merely\r\nintellectual errand, that unless she sent for the journal it seldom\r\nreached her hands.  Anne was always her messenger.  The arrival of the\r\nsoldiers led Mrs. Garland to despatch her daughter for it the day after\r\nthe party; and away she went in her hat and pelisse, in a direction at\r\nright angles to that of the encampment on the hill.\r\n\r\nWalking across the fields for the distance of a mile or two, she came out\r\nupon the high-road by a wicket-gate.  On the other side of the way was\r\nthe entrance to what at first sight looked like a neglected meadow, the\r\ngate being a rotten one, without a bottom rail, and broken-down palings\r\nlying on each side.  The dry hard mud of the opening was marked with\r\nseveral horse and cow tracks, that had been half obliterated by fifty\r\nscore sheep tracks, surcharged with the tracks of a man and a dog.  Beyond\r\nthis geological record appeared a carriage-road, nearly grown over with\r\ngrass, which Anne followed.  It descended by a gentle slope, dived under\r\ndark-rinded elm and chestnut trees, and conducted her on till the hiss of\r\na waterfall and the sound of the sea became audible, when it took a bend\r\nround a swamp of fresh watercress and brooklime that had once been a fish\r\npond.  Here the grey, weather-worn front of a building edged from behind\r\nthe trees.  It was Oxwell Hall, once the seat of a family now extinct,\r\nand of late years used as a farmhouse.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Derriman, who owned the crumbling place, had originally been\r\nonly the occupier and tenant-farmer of the fields around.  His wife had\r\nbrought him a small fortune, and during the growth of their only son\r\nthere had been a partition of the Oxwell estate, giving the farmer, now a\r\nwidower, the opportunity of acquiring the building and a small portion of\r\nthe land attached on exceptionally low terms.  But two years after the\r\npurchase the boy died, and Derriman\'s existence was paralyzed forthwith.\r\nIt was said that since that event he had devised the house and fields to\r\na distant female relative, to keep them out of the hands of his detested\r\nnephew; but this was not certainly known.\r\n\r\nThe hall was as interesting as mansions in a state of declension usually\r\nare, as the excellent county history showed.  That popular work in folio\r\ncontained an old plate dedicated to the last scion of the original\r\nowners, from which drawing it appeared that in 1750, the date of\r\npublication, the windows were covered with little scratches like black\r\nflashes of lightning; that a horn of hard smoke came out of each of the\r\ntwelve chimneys; that a lady and a lap-dog stood on the lawn in a\r\nstrenuously walking position; and a substantial cloud and nine flying\r\nbirds of no known species hung over the trees to the north-east.\r\n\r\nThe rambling and neglected dwelling had all the romantic excellencies and\r\npractical drawbacks which such mildewed places share in common with\r\ncaves, mountains, wildernesses, glens, and other homes of poesy that\r\npeople of taste wish to live and die in.  Mustard and cress could have\r\nbeen raised on the inner plaster of the dewy walls at any height not\r\nexceeding three feet from the floor; and mushrooms of the most refined\r\nand thin-stemmed kinds grew up through the chinks of the larder paving.\r\nAs for the outside, Nature, in the ample time that had been given her,\r\nhad so mingled her filings and effacements with the marks of human wear\r\nand tear upon the house, that it was often hard to say in which of the\r\ntwo or if in both, any particular obliteration had its origin.  The\r\nkeenness was gone from the mouldings of the doorways, but whether worn\r\nout by the rubbing past of innumerable people\'s shoulders, and the moving\r\nof their heavy furniture, or by Time in a grander and more abstract form,\r\ndid not appear.  The iron stanchions inside the window-panes were eaten\r\naway to the size of wires at the bottom where they entered the stone, the\r\ncondensed breathings of generations having settled there in pools and\r\nrusted them.  The panes themselves had either lost their shine altogether\r\nor become iridescent as a peacock\'s tail.  In the middle of the porch was\r\na vertical sun-dial, whose gnomon swayed loosely about when the wind\r\nblew, and cast its shadow hither and thither, as much as to say, \'Here\'s\r\nyour fine model dial; here\'s any time for any man; I am an old dial; and\r\nshiftiness is the best policy.\'\r\n\r\nAnne passed under the arched gateway which screened the main front; over\r\nit was the porter\'s lodge, reached by a spiral staircase.  Across the\r\narchway was fixed a row of wooden hurdles, one of which Anne opened and\r\nclosed behind her.  Their necessity was apparent as soon as she got\r\ninside.  The quadrangle of the ancient pile was a bed of mud and manure,\r\ninhabited by calves, geese, ducks, and sow pigs surprisingly large, with\r\nyoung ones surprisingly small.  In the groined porch some heifers were\r\namusing themselves by stretching up their necks and licking the carved\r\nstone capitals that supported the vaulting.  Anne went on to a second and\r\nopen door, across which was another hurdle to keep the live stock from\r\nabsolute community with the inmates.  There being no knocker, she knocked\r\nby means of a short stick which was laid against the post for that\r\npurpose; but nobody attending, she entered the passage, and tried an\r\ninner door.\r\n\r\nA slight noise was heard inside, the door opened about an inch, and a\r\nstrip of decayed face, including the eye and some forehead wrinkles,\r\nappeared within the crevice.\r\n\r\n\'Please I have come for the paper,\' said Anne.\r\n\r\n\'O, is it you, dear Anne?\' whined the inmate, opening the door a little\r\nfurther.  \'I could hardly get to the door to open it, I am so weak.\'\r\n\r\nThe speaker was a wizened old gentleman, in a coat the colour of his\r\nfarmyard, breeches of the same hue, unbuttoned at the knees, revealing a\r\nbit of leg above his stocking and a dazzlingly white shirt-frill to\r\ncompensate for this untidiness below.  The edge of his skull round his\r\neye-sockets was visible through the skin, and he had a mouth whose\r\ncorners made towards the back of his head on the slightest provocation.\r\nHe walked with great apparent difficulty back into the room, Anne\r\nfollowing him.\r\n\r\n\'Well, you can have the paper if you want it; but you never give me much\r\ntime to see what\'s in en!  Here\'s the paper.\'  He held it out, but before\r\nshe could take it he drew it back again, saying, \'I have not had my share\r\no\' the paper by a good deal, what with my weak sight, and people coming\r\nso soon for en.  I am a poor put-upon soul; but my "Duty of Man" will be\r\nleft to me when the newspaper is gone.\'  And he sank into his chair with\r\nan air of exhaustion.\r\n\r\nAnne said that she did not wish to take the paper if he had not done with\r\nit, and that she was really later in the week than usual, owing to the\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\n\'Soldiers, yes--rot the soldiers!  And now hedges will be broke, and\r\nhens\' nests robbed, and sucking-pigs stole, and I don\'t know what all.\r\nWho\'s to pay for\'t, sure?  I reckon that because the soldiers be come you\r\ndon\'t mean to be kind enough to read to me what I hadn\'t time to read\r\nmyself.\'\r\n\r\nShe would read if he wished, she said; she was in no hurry.  And sitting\r\nherself down she unfolded the paper.\r\n\r\n\'"Dinner at Carlton House"?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, faith.  \'Tis nothing to I.\'\r\n\r\n\'"Defence of the country"?\'\r\n\r\n\'Ye may read that if ye will.  I hope there will be no billeting in this\r\nparish, or any wild work of that sort; for what would a poor old lamiger\r\nlike myself do with soldiers in his house, and nothing to feed \'em with?\'\r\n\r\nAnne began reading, and continued at her task nearly ten minutes, when\r\nshe was interrupted by the appearance in the quadrangular slough without\r\nof a large figure in the uniform of the yeomanry cavalry.\r\n\r\n\'What do you see out there?\' said the farmer with a start, as she paused\r\nand slowly blushed.\r\n\r\n\'A soldier--one of the yeomanry,\' said Anne, not quite at her ease.\r\n\r\n\'Scrounch it all--\'tis my nephew!\' exclaimed the old man, his face\r\nturning to a phosphoric pallor, and his body twitching with innumerable\r\nalarms as he formed upon his face a gasping smile of joy, with which to\r\nwelcome the new-coming relative.  \'Read on, prithee, Miss Garland.\'\r\n\r\nBefore she had read far the visitor straddled over the door-hurdle into\r\nthe passage and entered the room.\r\n\r\n\'Well, nunc, how do you feel?\' said the giant, shaking hands with the\r\nfarmer in the manner of one violently ringing a hand-bell.  \'Glad to see\r\nyou.\'\r\n\r\n\'Bad and weakish, Festus,\' replied the other, his person responding\r\npassively to the rapid vibrations imparted.  \'O, be tender, please--a\r\nlittle softer, there\'s a dear nephew!  My arm is no more than a cobweb.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, poor soul!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I am not much more than a skeleton, and can\'t bear rough usage.\'\r\n\r\n\'Sorry to hear that; but I\'ll bear your affliction in mind.  Why, you are\r\nall in a tremble, Uncle Benjy!\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis because I am so gratified,\' said the old man.  \'I always get all in\r\na tremble when I am taken by surprise by a beloved relation.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, that\'s it!\' said the yeoman, bringing his hand down on the back of\r\nhis uncle\'s chair with a loud smack, at which Uncle Benjy nervously\r\nsprang three inches from his seat and dropped into it again.  \'Ask your\r\npardon for frightening ye, uncle.  \'Tis how we do in the army, and I\r\nforgot your nerves.  You have scarcely expected to see me, I dare say,\r\nbut here I am.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am glad to see ye.  You are not going to stay long, perhaps?\'\r\n\r\n\'Quite the contrary.  I am going to stay ever so long!\'\r\n\r\n\'O I see!  I am so glad, dear Festus.  Ever so long, did ye say?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, _ever_ so long,\' said the young gentleman, sitting on the slope of\r\nthe bureau and stretching out his legs as props.  \'I am going to make\r\nthis quite my own home whenever I am off duty, as long as we stay out.\r\nAnd after that, when the campaign is over in the autumn, I shall come\r\nhere, and live with you like your own son, and help manage your land and\r\nyour farm, you know, and make you a comfortable old man.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah!  How you do please me!\' said the farmer, with a horrified smile, and\r\ngrasping the arms of his chair to sustain himself.\r\n\r\n\'Yes; I have been meaning to come a long time, as I knew you\'d like to\r\nhave me, Uncle Benjy; and \'tisn\'t in my heart to refuse you.\'\r\n\r\n\'You always was kind that way!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; I always was.  But I ought to tell you at once, not to disappoint\r\nyou, that I shan\'t be here always--all day, that is, because of my\r\nmilitary duties as a cavalry man.\'\r\n\r\n\'O, not always?  That\'s a pity!\' exclaimed the farmer with a cheerful\r\neye.\r\n\r\n\'I knew you\'d say so.  And I shan\'t be able to sleep here at night\r\nsometimes, for the same reason.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not sleep here o\' nights?\' said the old gentleman, still more relieved.\r\n\'You ought to sleep here--you certainly ought; in short, you must.  But\r\nyou can\'t!\'\r\n\r\n\'Not while we are with the colours.  But directly that\'s over--the very\r\nnext day--I\'ll stay here all day, and all night too, to oblige you, since\r\nyou ask me so very kindly.\'\r\n\r\n\'Th-thank ye, that will be very nice!\' said Uncle Benjy.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I knew \'twould relieve ye.\'  And he kindly stroked his uncle\'s\r\nhead, the old man expressing his enjoyment at the affectionate token by a\r\ndeath\'s-head grimace.  \'I should have called to see you the other night\r\nwhen I passed through here,\' Festus continued; \'but it was so late that I\r\ncouldn\'t come so far out of my way.  You won\'t think it unkind?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not at all, if you _couldn\'t_.  I never shall think it unkind if you\r\nreally _can\'t_ come, you know, Festy.\'  There was a few minutes\' pause,\r\nand as the nephew said nothing Uncle Benjy went on: \'I wish I had a\r\nlittle present for ye.  But as ill-luck would have it we have lost a deal\r\nof stock this year, and I have had to pay away so much.\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor old man--I know you have.  Shall I lend you a seven-shilling piece,\r\nUncle Benjy?\'\r\n\r\n\'Ha, ha!--you must have your joke; well, I\'ll think o\' that.  And so they\r\nexpect Buonaparty to choose this very part of the coast for his landing,\r\nhey?  And that the yeomanry be to stand in front as the forlorn hope?\'\r\n\r\n\'Who says so?\' asked the florid son of Mars, losing a little redness.\r\n\r\n\'The newspaper-man.\'\r\n\r\n\'O, there\'s nothing in that,\' said Festus bravely.  \'The gover\'ment\r\nthought it possible at one time; but they don\'t know.\'\r\n\r\nFestus turned himself as he talked, and now said abruptly: \'Ah, who\'s\r\nthis?  Why, \'tis our little Anne!\'  He had not noticed her till this\r\nmoment, the young woman having at his entry kept her face over the\r\nnewspaper, and then got away to the back part of the room.  \'And are you\r\nand your mother always going to stay down there in the mill-house\r\nwatching the little fishes, Miss Anne?\'\r\n\r\nShe said that it was uncertain, in a tone of truthful precision which the\r\nquestion was hardly worth, looking forcedly at him as she spoke.  But she\r\nblushed fitfully, in her arms and hands as much as in her face.  Not that\r\nshe was overpowered by the great boots, formidable spurs, and other\r\nfierce appliances of his person, as he imagined; simply she had not been\r\nprepared to meet him there.\r\n\r\n\'I hope you will, I am sure, for my own good,\' said he, letting his eyes\r\nlinger on the round of her cheek.\r\n\r\nAnne became a little more dignified, and her look showed reserve.  But\r\nthe yeoman on perceiving this went on talking to her in so civil a way\r\nthat he irresistibly amused her, though she tried to conceal all feeling.\r\nAt a brighter remark of his than usual her mouth moved, her upper lip\r\nplaying uncertainly over her white teeth; it would stay still--no, it\r\nwould withdraw a little way in a smile; then it would flutter down again;\r\nand so it wavered like a butterfly in a tender desire to be pleased and\r\nsmiling, and yet to be also sedate and composed; to show him that she did\r\nnot want compliments, and yet that she was not so cold as to wish to\r\nrepress any genuine feeling he might be anxious to utter.\r\n\r\n\'Shall you want any more reading, Mr. Derriman?\' said she, interrupting\r\nthe younger man in his remarks.  \'If not, I\'ll go homeward.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t let me hinder you longer,\' said Festus.  \'I\'m off in a minute or\r\ntwo, when your man has cleaned my boots.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ye don\'t hinder us, nephew.  She must have the paper: \'tis the day for\r\nher to have \'n.  She might read a little more, as I have had so little\r\nprofit out o\' en hitherto.  Well, why don\'t ye speak?  Will ye, or won\'t\r\nye, my dear?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not to two,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'Ho, ho! damn it, I must go then, I suppose,\' said Festus, laughing; and\r\nunable to get a further glance from her he left the room and clanked into\r\nthe back yard, where he saw a man; holding up his hand he cried, \'Anthony\r\nCripplestraw!\'\r\n\r\nCripplestraw came up in a trot, moved a lock of his hair and replaced it,\r\nand said, \'Yes, Maister Derriman.\'  He was old Mr. Derriman\'s odd hand in\r\nthe yard and garden, and like his employer had no great pretensions to\r\nmanly beauty, owing to a limpness of backbone and speciality of mouth,\r\nwhich opened on one side only, giving him a triangular smile.\r\n\r\n\'Well, Cripplestraw, how is it to-day?\' said Festus, with\r\nsocially-superior heartiness.\r\n\r\n\'Middlin\', considering, Maister Derriman.  And how\'s yerself?\'\r\n\r\n\'Fairish.  Well, now, see and clean these military boots of mine.  I\'ll\r\ncock my foot up on this bench.  This pigsty of my uncle\'s is not fit for\r\na soldier to come into.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, Maister Derriman, I will.  No, \'tis not fit, Maister Derriman.\'\r\n\r\n\'What stock has uncle lost this year, Cripplestraw?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, let\'s see, sir.  I can call to mind that we\'ve lost three\r\nchickens, a tom-pigeon, and a weakly sucking-pig, one of a fare of ten.  I\r\ncan\'t think of no more, Maister Derriman.\'\r\n\r\n\'H\'m, not a large quantity of cattle.  The old rascal!\'\r\n\r\n\'No, \'tis not a large quantity.  Old what did you say, sir?\'\r\n\r\n\'O nothing.  He\'s within there.\'  Festus flung his forehead in the\r\ndirection of a right line towards the inner apartment.  \'He\'s a regular\r\nsniche one.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hee, hee; fie, fie, Master Derriman!\' said Cripplestraw, shaking his\r\nhead in delighted censure.  \'Gentlefolks shouldn\'t talk so.  And an\r\nofficer, Mr. Derriman!  \'Tis the duty of all cavalry gentlemen to bear in\r\nmind that their blood is a knowed thing in the country, and not to speak\r\nill o\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'He\'s close-fisted.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, maister, he is--I own he is a little.  \'Tis the nater of some old\r\nvenerable gentlemen to be so.  We\'ll hope he\'ll treat ye well in yer\r\nfortune, sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hope he will.  Do people talk about me here, Cripplestraw?\' asked the\r\nyeoman, as the other continued busy with his boots.\r\n\r\n\'Well, yes, sir; they do off and on, you know.  They says you be as fine\r\na piece of calvery flesh and bones as was ever growed on fallow-ground;\r\nin short, all owns that you be a fine fellow, sir.  I wish I wasn\'t no\r\nmore afraid of the French than you be; but being in the Locals, Maister\r\nDerriman, I assure ye I dream of having to defend my country every night;\r\nand I don\'t like the dream at all.\'\r\n\r\n\'You should take it careless, Cripplestraw, as I do; and \'twould soon\r\ncome natural to you not to mind it at all.  Well, a fine fellow is not\r\neverything, you know.  O no.  There\'s as good as I in the army, and even\r\nbetter.\'\r\n\r\n\'And they say that when you fall this summer, you\'ll die like a man.\'\r\n\r\n\'When I fall?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sure, Maister Derriman.  Poor soul o\' thee!  I shan\'t forget \'ee as\r\nyou lie mouldering in yer soldier\'s grave.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hey?\' said the warrior uneasily.  \'What makes \'em think I am going to\r\nfall?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, sir, by all accounts the yeomanry will be put in front.\'\r\n\r\n\'Front!  That\'s what my uncle has been saying.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, and by all accounts \'tis true.  And naterelly they\'ll be mowed down\r\nlike grass; and you among \'em, poor young galliant officer!\'\r\n\r\n\'Look here, Cripplestraw.  This is a reg\'lar foolish report.  How can\r\nyeomanry be put in front?  Nobody\'s put in front.  We yeomanry have\r\nnothing to do with Buonaparte\'s landing.  We shall be away in a safe\r\nplace, guarding the possessions and jewels.  Now, can you see,\r\nCripplestraw, any way at all that the yeomanry can be put in front?  Do\r\nyou think they really can?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, maister, I am afraid I do,\' said the cheering Cripplestraw.  \'And\r\nI know a great warrior like you is only too glad o\' the chance.  \'Twill\r\nbe a great thing for ye, death and glory!  In short, I hope from my heart\r\nyou will be, and I say so very often to folk--in fact, I pray at night\r\nfor\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'O! cuss you! you needn\'t pray about it.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, Maister Derriman, I won\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course my sword will do its duty.  That\'s enough.  And now be off\r\nwith ye.\'\r\n\r\nFestus gloomily returned to his uncle\'s room and found that Anne was just\r\nleaving.  He was inclined to follow her at once, but as she gave him no\r\nopportunity for doing this he went to the window, and remained tapping\r\nhis fingers against the shutter while she crossed the yard.\r\n\r\n\'Well, nephy, you are not gone yet?\' said the farmer, looking dubiously\r\nat Festus from under one eyelid.  \'You see how I am.  Not by any means\r\nbetter, you see; so I can\'t entertain \'ee as well as I would.\'\r\n\r\n\'You can\'t, nunc, you can\'t.  I don\'t think you are worse--if I do, dash\r\nmy wig.  But you\'ll have plenty of opportunities to make me welcome when\r\nyou are better.  If you are not so brisk inwardly as you was, why not try\r\nchange of air?  This is a dull, damp hole.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis, Festus; and I am thinking of moving.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, where to?\' said Festus, with surprise and interest.\r\n\r\n\'Up into the garret in the north corner.  There is no fireplace in the\r\nroom; but I shan\'t want that, poor soul o\' me.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis not moving far.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis not.  But I have not a soul belonging to me within ten mile; and\r\nyou know very well that I couldn\'t afford to go to lodgings that I had to\r\npay for.\'\r\n\r\n\'I know it--I know it, Uncle Benjy!  Well, don\'t be disturbed.  I\'ll come\r\nand manage for you as soon as ever this Boney alarm is over; but when a\r\nman\'s country calls he must obey, if he is a man.\'\r\n\r\n\'A splendid spirit!\' said Uncle Benjy, with much admiration on the\r\nsurface of his countenance.  \'I never had it.  How could it have got into\r\nthe boy?\'\r\n\r\n\'From my mother\'s side, perhaps.\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps so.  Well, take care of yourself, nephy,\' said the farmer,\r\nwaving his hand impressively.  \'Take care!  In these warlike times your\r\nspirit may carry ye into the arms of the enemy; and you are the last of\r\nthe family.  You should think of this, and not let your bravery carry ye\r\naway.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t be disturbed, uncle; I\'ll control myself,\' said Festus, betrayed\r\ninto self-complacency against his will.  \'At least I\'ll do what I can,\r\nbut nature will out sometimes.  Well, I\'m off.\'  He began humming\r\n\'Brighton Camp,\' and, promising to come again soon, retired with\r\nassurance, each yard of his retreat adding private joyousness to his\r\nuncle\'s form.\r\n\r\nWhen the bulky young man had disappeared through the porter\'s lodge,\r\nUncle Benjy showed preternatural activity for one in his invalid state,\r\njumping up quickly without his stick, at the same time opening and\r\nshutting his mouth quite silently like a thirsty frog, which was his way\r\nof expressing mirth.  He ran upstairs as quick as an old squirrel, and\r\nwent to a dormer window which commanded a view of the grounds beyond the\r\ngate, and the footpath that stretched across them to the village.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes!\' he said in a suppressed scream, dancing up and down, \'he\'s\r\nafter her: she\'ve hit en!\'  For there appeared upon the path the figure\r\nof Anne Garland, and, hastening on at some little distance behind her,\r\nthe swaggering shape of Festus.  She became conscious of his approach,\r\nand moved more quickly.  He moved more quickly still, and overtook her.\r\nShe turned as if in answer to a call from him, and he walked on beside\r\nher, till they were out of sight.  The old man then played upon an\r\nimaginary fiddle for about half a minute; and, suddenly discontinuing\r\nthese signs of pleasure, went downstairs again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.  HOW THEY TALKED IN THE PASTURES\r\n\r\n\r\n\'You often come this way?\' said Festus to Anne rather before he had\r\novertaken her.\r\n\r\n\'I come for the newspaper and other things,\' she said, perplexed by a\r\ndoubt whether he were there by accident or design.\r\n\r\nThey moved on in silence, Festus beating the grass with his switch in a\r\nmasterful way.  \'Did you speak, Mis\'ess Anne?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said Anne.\r\n\r\n\'Ten thousand pardons.  I thought you did.  Now don\'t let me drive you\r\nout of the path.  I can walk among the high grass and giltycups--they\r\nwill not yellow my stockings as they will yours.  Well, what do you think\r\nof a lot of soldiers coming to the neighbourhood in this way?\'\r\n\r\n\'I think it is very lively, and a great change,\' she said with demure\r\nseriousness.\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps you don\'t like us warriors as a body?\'\r\n\r\nAnne smiled without replying.\r\n\r\n\'Why, you are laughing!\' said the yeoman, looking searchingly at her and\r\nblushing like a little fire.  \'What do you see to laugh at?\'\r\n\r\n\'Did I laugh?\' said Anne, a little scared at his sudden mortification.\r\n\r\n\'Why, yes; you know you did, you young sneerer,\' he said like a cross\r\nbaby.  \'You are laughing at me--that\'s who you are laughing at!  I should\r\nlike to know what you would do without such as me if the French were to\r\ndrop in upon ye any night?\'\r\n\r\n\'Would you help to beat them off?\' said she.\r\n\r\n\'Can you ask such a question?  What are we for?  But you don\'t think\r\nanything of soldiers.\'\r\n\r\nO yes, she liked soldiers, she said, especially when they came home from\r\nthe wars, covered with glory; though when she thought what doings had won\r\nthem that glory she did not like them quite so well.  The gallant and\r\nappeased yeoman said he supposed her to mean chopping off heads, blowing\r\nout brains, and that kind of business, and thought it quite right that a\r\ntender-hearted thing like her should feel a little horrified.  But as for\r\nhim, he should not mind such another Blenheim this summer as the army had\r\nfought a hundred years ago, or whenever it was--dash his wig if he should\r\nmind it at all.  \'Hullo! now you are laughing again; yes, I saw you!\'  And\r\nthe choleric Festus turned his blue eyes and flushed face upon her as\r\nthough he would read her through.  Anne strove valiantly to look calmly\r\nback; but her eyes could not face his, and they fell.  \'You did laugh!\'\r\nhe repeated.\r\n\r\n\'It was only a tiny little one,\' she murmured.\r\n\r\n\'Ah--I knew you did!\' thundered he.  \'Now what was it you laughed at?\'\r\n\r\n\'I only--thought that you were--merely in the yeomanry,\' she murmured\r\nslily.\r\n\r\n\'And what of that?\'\r\n\r\n\'And the yeomanry only seem farmers that have lost their senses.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes!  I knew you meant some jeering o\' that sort, Mistress Anne.\r\nBut I suppose \'tis the way of women, and I take no notice.  I\'ll confess\r\nthat some of us are no great things: but I know how to draw a sword,\r\ndon\'t I?--say I don\'t just to provoke me.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am sure you do,\' said Anne sweetly.  \'If a Frenchman came up to you,\r\nMr. Derriman, would you take him on the hip, or on the thigh?\'\r\n\r\n\'Now you are flattering!\' he said, his white teeth uncovering themselves\r\nin a smile.  \'Well, of course I should draw my sword--no, I mean my sword\r\nwould be already drawn; and I should put spurs to my horse--charger, as\r\nwe call it in the army; and I should ride up to him and say--no, I\r\nshouldn\'t say anything, of course--men never waste words in battle; I\r\nshould take him with the third guard, low point, and then coming back to\r\nthe second guard--\'\r\n\r\n\'But that would be taking care of yourself--not hitting at him.\'\r\n\r\n\'How can you say that!\' he cried, the beams upon his face turning to a\r\nlurid cloud in a moment.  \'How can you understand military terms who\'ve\r\nnever had a sword in your life?  I shouldn\'t take him with the sword at\r\nall.\'  He went on with eager sulkiness, \'I should take him with my\r\npistol.  I should pull off my right glove, and throw back my goat-skin;\r\nthen I should open my priming-pan, prime, and cast about--no, I\r\nshouldn\'t, that\'s wrong; I should draw my right pistol, and as soon as\r\nloaded, seize the weapon by the butt; then at the word "Cock your pistol"\r\nI should--\'\r\n\r\n\'Then there is plenty of time to give such words of command in the heat\r\nof battle?\' said Anne innocently.\r\n\r\n\'No!\' said the yeoman, his face again in flames.  \'Why, of course I am\r\nonly telling you what _would_ be the word of command _if_--there now! you\r\nla--\'\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t; \'pon my word I didn\'t!\'\r\n\r\n\'No, I don\'t think you did; it was my mistake.  Well, then I come smartly\r\nto Present, looking well along the barrel--along the barrel--and fire.  Of\r\ncourse I know well enough how to engage the enemy!  But I expect my old\r\nuncle has been setting you against me.\'\r\n\r\n\'He has not said a word,\' replied Anne; \'though I have heard of you, of\r\ncourse.\'\r\n\r\n\'What have you heard?  Nothing good, I dare say.  It makes my blood boil\r\nwithin me!\'\r\n\r\n\'O, nothing bad,\' said she assuringly.  \'Just a word now and then.\'\r\n\r\n\'Now, come, tell me, there\'s a dear.  I don\'t like to be crossed.  It\r\nshall be a sacred secret between us.  Come, now!\'\r\n\r\nAnne was embarrassed, and her smile was uncomfortable.  \'I shall not tell\r\nyou,\' she said at last.\r\n\r\n\'There it is again!\' said the yeoman, throwing himself into a despair.  \'I\r\nshall soon begin to believe that my name is not worth sixpence about\r\nhere!\'\r\n\r\n\'I tell you \'twas nothing against you,\' repeated Anne.\r\n\r\n\'That means it might have been for me,\' said Festus, in a mollified tone.\r\n\'Well, though, to speak the truth, I have a good many faults, some people\r\nwill praise me, I suppose.  \'Twas praise?\'\r\n\r\n\'It was.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I am not much at farming, and I am not much in company, and I am\r\nnot much at figures, but perhaps I must own, since it is forced upon me,\r\nthat I can show as fine a soldier\'s figure on the Esplanade as any man of\r\nthe cavalry.\'\r\n\r\n\'You can,\' said Anne; for though her flesh crept in mortal terror of his\r\nirascibility, she could not resist the fearful pleasure of leading him\r\non.  \'You look very well; and some say, you are--\'\r\n\r\n\'What?  Well, they say I am good-looking.  I don\'t make myself, so \'tis\r\nno praise.  Hullo! what are you looking across there for?\'\r\n\r\n\'Only at a bird that I saw fly out of that tree,\' said Anne.\r\n\r\n\'What?  Only at a bird, do you say?\' he heaved out in a voice of thunder.\r\n\'I see your shoulders a-shaking, young madam.  Now don\'t you provoke me\r\nwith that laughing!  By God, it won\'t do!\'\r\n\r\n\'Then go away!\' said Anne, changed from mirthfulness to irritation by his\r\nrough manner.  \'I don\'t want your company, you great bragging thing!  You\r\nare so touchy there\'s no bearing with you.  Go away!\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no, Anne; I am wrong to speak to you so.  I give you free liberty to\r\nsay what you will to me.  Say I am not a bit of a soldier, or anything!\r\nAbuse me--do now, there\'s a dear.  I\'m scum, I\'m froth, I\'m dirt before\r\nthe besom--yes!\'\r\n\r\n\'I have nothing to say, sir.  Stay where you are till I am out of this\r\nfield.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, there\'s such command in your looks that I ha\'n\'t heart to go\r\nagainst you.  You will come this way to-morrow at the same time?  Now,\r\ndon\'t be uncivil.\'\r\n\r\nShe was too generous not to forgive him, but the short little lip\r\nmurmured that she did not think it at all likely she should come that way\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\n\'Then Sunday?\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'Not Sunday,\' said she.\r\n\r\n\'Then Monday--Tuesday--Wednesday, surely?\' he went on experimentally.\r\n\r\nShe answered that she should probably not see him on either day, and,\r\ncutting short the argument, went through the wicket into the other field.\r\nFestus paused, looking after her; and when he could no longer see her\r\nslight figure he swept away his deliberations, began singing, and turned\r\noff in the other direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.  ANNE MAKES A CIRCUIT OF THE CAMP\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Anne was crossing the last field, she saw approaching her an old\r\nwoman with wrinkled cheeks, who surveyed the earth and its inhabitants\r\nthrough the medium of brass-rimmed spectacles.  Shaking her head at Anne\r\ntill the glasses shone like two moons, she said, \'Ah, ah; I zeed ye!  If\r\nI had only kept on my short ones that I use for reading the Collect and\r\nGospel I shouldn\'t have zeed ye; but thinks I, I be going out o\' doors,\r\nand I\'ll put on my long ones, little thinking what they\'d show me.  Ay, I\r\ncan tell folk at any distance with these--\'tis a beautiful pair for out\r\no\' doors; though my short ones be best for close work, such as darning,\r\nand catching fleas, that\'s true.\'\r\n\r\n\'What have you seen, Granny Seamore?\' said Anne.\r\n\r\n\'Fie, fie, Miss Nancy! you know,\' said Granny Seamore, shaking her head\r\nstill.  \'But he\'s a fine young feller, and will have all his uncle\'s\r\nmoney when \'a\'s gone.\'  Anne said nothing to this, and looking ahead with\r\na smile passed Granny Seamore by.\r\n\r\nFestus, the subject of the remark, was at this time about\r\nthree-and-twenty, a fine fellow as to feet and inches, and of a\r\nremarkably warm tone in skin and hair.  Symptoms of beard and whiskers\r\nhad appeared upon him at a very early age, owing to his persistent use of\r\nthe razor before there was any necessity for its operation.  The brave\r\nboy had scraped unseen in the out-house, in the cellar, in the wood-shed,\r\nin the stable, in the unused parlour, in the cow-stalls, in the barn, and\r\nwherever he could set up his triangular bit of looking-glass without\r\nobservation, or extemporize a mirror by sticking up his hat on the\r\noutside of a window-pane.  The result now was that, did he neglect to use\r\nthe instrument he once had trifled with, a fine rust broke out upon his\r\ncountenance on the first day, a golden lichen on the second, and a fiery\r\nstubble on the third to a degree which admitted of no further\r\npostponement.\r\n\r\nHis disposition divided naturally into two, the boastful and the\r\ncantankerous.  When Festus put on the big pot, as it is classically\r\ncalled, he was quite blinded ipso facto to the diverting effect of that\r\nmood and manner upon others; but when disposed to be envious or\r\nquarrelsome he was rather shrewd than otherwise, and could do some pretty\r\nstrokes of satire.  He was both liked and abused by the girls who knew\r\nhim, and though they were pleased by his attentions, they never failed to\r\nridicule him behind his back.  In his cups (he knew those vessels, though\r\nonly twenty-three) he first became noisy, then excessively friendly, and\r\nthen invariably nagging.  During childhood he had made himself renowned\r\nfor his pleasant habit of pouncing down upon boys smaller and poorer than\r\nhimself, and knocking their birds\' nests out of their hands, or\r\noverturning their little carts of apples, or pouring water down their\r\nbacks; but his conduct became singularly the reverse of aggressive the\r\nmoment the little boys\' mothers ran out to him, brandishing brooms,\r\nfrying-pans, skimmers, and whatever else they could lay hands on by way\r\nof weapons.  He then fled and hid behind bushes, under faggots, or in\r\npits till they had gone away; and on one such occasion was known to creep\r\ninto a badger\'s hole quite out of sight, maintaining that post with great\r\nfirmness and resolution for two or three hours.  He had brought more\r\nvulgar exclamations upon the tongues of respectable parents in his native\r\nparish than any other boy of his time.  When other youngsters snowballed\r\nhim he ran into a place of shelter, where he kneaded snowballs of his\r\nown, with a stone inside, and used these formidable missiles in returning\r\ntheir pleasantry.  Sometimes he got fearfully beaten by boys his own age,\r\nwhen he would roar most lustily, but fight on in the midst of his tears,\r\nblood, and cries.\r\n\r\nHe was early in love, and had at the time of the story suffered from the\r\nravages of that passion thirteen distinct times.  He could not love\r\nlightly and gaily; his love was earnest, cross-tempered, and even savage.\r\nIt was a positive agony to him to be ridiculed by the object of his\r\naffections, and such conduct drove him into a frenzy if persisted in.  He\r\nwas a torment to those who behaved humbly towards him, cynical with those\r\nwho denied his superiority, and a very nice fellow towards those who had\r\nthe courage to ill-use him.\r\n\r\nThis stalwart gentleman and Anne Garland did not cross each other\'s paths\r\nagain for a week.  Then her mother began as before about the newspaper,\r\nand, though Anne did not much like the errand, she agreed to go for it on\r\nMrs. Garland pressing her with unusual anxiety.  Why her mother was so\r\npersistent on so small a matter quite puzzled the girl; but she put on\r\nher hat and started.\r\n\r\nAs she had expected, Festus appeared at a stile over which she sometimes\r\nwent for shortness\' sake, and showed by his manner that he awaited her.\r\nWhen she saw this she kept straight on, as if she would not enter the\r\npark at all.\r\n\r\n\'Surely this is your way?\' said Festus.\r\n\r\n\'I was thinking of going round by the road,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'Why is that?\'\r\n\r\nShe paused, as if she were not inclined to say.  \'I go that way when the\r\ngrass is wet,\' she returned at last.\r\n\r\n\'It is not wet now,\' he persisted; \'the sun has been shining on it these\r\nnine hours.\'  The fact was that the way by the path was less open than by\r\nthe road, and Festus wished to walk with her uninterrupted.  \'But, of\r\ncourse, it is nothing to me what you do.\'  He flung himself from the\r\nstile and walked away towards the house.\r\n\r\nAnne, supposing him really indifferent, took the same way, upon which he\r\nturned his head and waited for her with a proud smile.\r\n\r\n\'I cannot go with you,\' she said decisively.\r\n\r\n\'Nonsense, you foolish girl!  I must walk along with you down to the\r\ncorner.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, please, Mr. Derriman; we might be seen.\'\r\n\r\n\'Now, now--that\'s shyness!\' he said jocosely.\r\n\r\n\'No; you know I cannot let you.\'\r\n\r\n\'But I must.\'\r\n\r\n\'But I do not allow it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Allow it or not, I will.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then you are unkind, and I must submit,\' she said, her eyes brimming\r\nwith tears.\r\n\r\n\'Ho, ho; what a shame of me!  My wig, I won\'t do any such thing for the\r\nworld,\' said the repentant yeoman.  \'Haw, haw; why, I thought your "go\r\naway" meant "come on," as it does with so many of the women I meet,\r\nespecially in these clothes.  Who was to know you were so confoundedly\r\nserious?\'\r\n\r\nAs he did not go Anne stood still and said nothing.\r\n\r\n\'I see you have a deal more caution and a deal less good-nature than I\r\never thought you had,\' he continued emphatically.\r\n\r\n\'No, sir; it is not any planned manner of mine at all,\' she said\r\nearnestly.  \'But you will see, I am sure, that I could not go down to the\r\nhall with you without putting myself in a wrong light.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; that\'s it, that\'s it.  I am only a fellow in the yeomanry cavalry--a\r\nplain soldier, I may say; and we know what women think of such: that they\r\nare a bad lot--men you mustn\'t speak to for fear of losing your\r\ncharacter--chaps you avoid in the roads--chaps that come into a house\r\nlike oxen, daub the stairs wi\' their boots, stain the furniture wi\' their\r\ndrink, talk rubbish to the servants, abuse all that\'s holy and righteous,\r\nand are only saved from being carried off by Old Nick because they are\r\nwanted for Boney.\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed, I didn\'t know you were thought so bad of as that,\' said she\r\nsimply.\r\n\r\n\'What! don\'t my uncle complain to you of me?  You are a favourite of that\r\nhandsome, nice old gaffer\'s, I know.\'\r\n\r\n\'Never.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, what do we think of our nice trumpet-major, hey?\'\r\n\r\nAnne closed her mouth up tight, built it up, in fact, to show that no\r\nanswer was coming to that question.\r\n\r\n\'O now, come, seriously, Loveday is a good fellow, and so is his father.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know.\'\r\n\r\n\'What a close little rogue you are!  There is no getting anything out of\r\nyou.  I believe you would say "I don\'t know," to every mortal question,\r\nso very discreet as you are.  Upon my heart, there are some women who\r\nwould say "I don\'t know," to "Will ye marry me?"\'\r\n\r\nThe brightness upon Anne\'s cheek and in her eyes during this remark\r\nshowed that there was a fair quantity of life and warmth beneath the\r\ndiscretion he complained of.  Having spoken thus, he drew aside that she\r\nmight pass, and bowed very low.  Anne formally inclined herself and went\r\non.\r\n\r\nShe had been at vexation point all the time that he was present, from a\r\nhaunting sense that he would not have spoken to her so freely had she\r\nbeen a young woman with thriving male relatives to keep forward admirers\r\nin check.  But she had been struck, now as at their previous meeting,\r\nwith the power she possessed of working him up either to irritation or to\r\ncomplacency at will; and this consciousness of being able to play upon\r\nhim as upon an instrument disposed her to a humorous considerateness, and\r\nmade her tolerate even while she rebuffed him.\r\n\r\nWhen Anne got to the hall the farmer, as usual, insisted upon her reading\r\nwhat he had been unable to get through, and held the paper tightly in his\r\nskinny hand till she had agreed.  He sent her to a hard chair that she\r\ncould not possibly injure to the extent of a pennyworth by sitting in it\r\na twelvemonth, and watched her from the outer angle of his near eye while\r\nshe bent over the paper.  His look might have been suggested by the sight\r\nthat he had witnessed from his window on the last occasion of her visit,\r\nfor it partook of the nature of concern.  The old man was afraid of his\r\nnephew, physically and morally, and he began to regard Anne as a fellow-\r\nsufferer under the same despot.  After this sly and curious gaze at her\r\nhe withdrew his eye again, so that when she casually lifted her own there\r\nwas nothing visible but his keen bluish profile as before.\r\n\r\nWhen the reading was about half-way through, the door behind them opened,\r\nand footsteps crossed the threshold.  The farmer diminished perceptibly\r\nin his chair, and looked fearful, but pretended to be absorbed in the\r\nreading, and quite unconscious of an intruder.  Anne felt the presence of\r\nthe swashing Festus, and stopped her reading.\r\n\r\n\'Please go on, Miss Anne,\' he said, \'I am not going to speak a word.\'  He\r\nwithdrew to the mantelpiece and leaned against it at his ease.\r\n\r\n\'Go on, do ye, maidy Anne,\' said Uncle Benjy, keeping down his tremblings\r\nby a great effort to half their natural extent.\r\n\r\nAnne\'s voice became much lower now that there were two listeners, and her\r\nmodesty shrank somewhat from exposing to Festus the appreciative\r\nmodulations which an intelligent interest in the subject drew from her\r\nwhen unembarrassed.  But she still went on that he might not suppose her\r\nto be disconcerted, though the ensuing ten minutes was one of\r\ndisquietude.  She knew that the bothering yeoman\'s eyes were travelling\r\nover her from his position behind, creeping over her shoulders, up to her\r\nhead, and across her arms and hands.  Old Benjy on his part knew the same\r\nthing, and after sundry endeavours to peep at his nephew from the corner\r\nof his eye, he could bear the situation no longer.\r\n\r\n\'Do ye want to say anything to me, nephew?\' he quaked.\r\n\r\n\'No, uncle, thank ye,\' said Festus heartily.  \'I like to stay here,\r\nthinking of you and looking at your back hair.\'\r\n\r\nThe nervous old man writhed under this vivisection, and Anne read on;\r\ntill, to the relief of both, the gallant fellow grew tired of his\r\namusement and went out of the room.  Anne soon finished her paragraph and\r\nrose to go, determined never to come again as long as Festus haunted the\r\nprecincts.  Her face grew warmer as she thought that he would be sure to\r\nwaylay her on her journey home to-day.\r\n\r\nOn this account, when she left the house, instead of going in the\r\ncustomary direction, she bolted round to the further side, through the\r\nbushes, along under the kitchen-garden wall, and through a door leading\r\ninto a rutted cart-track, which had been a pleasant gravelled drive when\r\nthe fine old hall was in its prosperity.  Once out of sight of the\r\nwindows she ran with all her might till she had quitted the park by a\r\nroute directly opposite to that towards her home.  Why she was so\r\nseriously bent upon doing this she could hardly tell but the instinct to\r\nrun was irresistible.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary now to clamber over the down to the left of the camp,\r\nand make a complete circuit round the latter--infantry, cavalry, sutlers,\r\nand all--descending to her house on the other side.  This tremendous walk\r\nshe performed at a rapid rate, never once turning her head, and avoiding\r\nevery beaten track to keep clear of the knots of soldiers taking a walk.\r\nWhen she at last got down to the levels again she paused to fetch breath,\r\nand murmured, \'Why did I take so much trouble?  He would not, after all,\r\nhave hurt me.\'\r\n\r\nAs she neared the mill an erect figure with a blue body and white thighs\r\ndescended before her from the down towards the village, and went past the\r\nmill to a stile beyond, over which she usually returned to her house.\r\nHere he lingered.  On coming nearer Anne discovered this person to be\r\nTrumpet-major Loveday; and not wishing to meet anybody just now Anne\r\npassed quickly on, and entered the house by the garden door.\r\n\r\n\'My dear Anne, what a time you have been gone!\' said her mother.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I have been round by another road.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why did you do that?\'\r\n\r\nAnne looked thoughtful and reticent, for her reason was almost too silly\r\na one to confess.  \'Well, I wanted to avoid a person who is very busy\r\ntrying to meet me--that\'s all,\' she said.\r\n\r\nHer mother glanced out of the window.  \'And there he is, I suppose,\' she\r\nsaid, as John Loveday, tired of looking for Anne at the stile, passed the\r\nhouse on his way to his father\'s door.  He could not help casting his\r\neyes towards their window, and, seeing them, he smiled.\r\n\r\nAnne\'s reluctance to mention Festus was such that she did not correct her\r\nmother\'s error, and the dame went on: \'Well, you are quite right, my\r\ndear.  Be friendly with him, but no more at present.  I have heard of\r\nyour other affair, and think it is a very wise choice.  I am sure you\r\nhave my best wishes in it, and I only hope it will come to a point.\'\r\n\r\n\'What\'s that?\' said the astonished Anne.\r\n\r\n\'You and Mr. Festus Derriman, dear.  You need not mind me; I have known\r\nit for several days.  Old Granny Seamore called here Saturday, and told\r\nme she saw him coming home with you across Park Close last week, when you\r\nwent for the newspaper; so I thought I\'d send you again to-day, and give\r\nyou another chance.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then you didn\'t want the paper--and it was only for that!\'\r\n\r\n\'He\'s a very fine young fellow; he looks a thorough woman\'s protector.\'\r\n\r\n\'He may look it,\' said Anne.\r\n\r\n\'He has given up the freehold farm his father held at Pitstock, and lives\r\nin independence on what the land brings him.  And when Farmer Derriman\r\ndies, he\'ll have all the old man\'s, for certain.  He\'ll be worth ten\r\nthousand pounds, if a penny, in money, besides sixteen horses, cart and\r\nhack, a fifty-cow dairy, and at least five hundred sheep.\'\r\n\r\nAnne turned away, and instead of informing her mother that she had been\r\nrunning like a doe to escape the interesting heir-presumptive alluded to,\r\nmerely said \'Mother, I don\'t like this at all.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.  ANNE IS KINDLY FETCHED BY THE TRUMPET-MAJOR\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this, Anne would on no account walk in the direction of the hall\r\nfor fear of another encounter with young Derriman.  In the course of a\r\nfew days it was told in the village that the old farmer had actually gone\r\nfor a week\'s holiday and change of air to the Royal watering-place near\r\nat hand, at the instance of his nephew Festus.  This was a wonderful\r\nthing to hear of Uncle Benjy, who had not slept outside the walls of\r\nOxwell Hall for many a long year before; and Anne well imagined what\r\nextraordinary pressure must have been put upon him to induce him to take\r\nsuch a step.  She pictured his unhappiness at the bustling\r\nwatering-place, and hoped no harm would come to him.\r\n\r\nShe spent much of her time indoors or in the garden, hearing little of\r\nthe camp movements beyond the periodical Ta-ta-ta-taa of the trumpeters\r\nsounding their various ingenious calls for watch-setting, stables, feed,\r\nboot-and-saddle, parade, and so on, which made her think how clever her\r\nfriend the trumpet-major must be to teach his pupils to play those pretty\r\nlittle tunes so well.\r\n\r\nOn the third morning after Uncle Benjy\'s departure, she was disturbed as\r\nusual while dressing by the tramp of the troops down the slope to the\r\nmill-pond, and during the now familiar stamping and splashing which\r\nfollowed there sounded upon the glass of the window a slight smack, which\r\nmight have been caused by a whip or switch.  She listened more\r\nparticularly, and it was repeated.\r\n\r\nAs John Loveday was the only dragoon likely to be aware that she slept in\r\nthat particular apartment, she imagined the signal to come from him,\r\nthough wondering that he should venture upon such a freak of familiarity.\r\n\r\nWrapping herself up in a red cloak, she went to the window, gently drew\r\nup a corner of the curtain, and peeped out, as she had done many times\r\nbefore.  Nobody who was not quite close beneath her window could see her\r\nface; but as it happened, somebody was close.  The soldiers whose\r\nfloundering Anne had heard were not Loveday\'s dragoons, but a troop of\r\nthe York Hussars, quite oblivious of her existence.  They had passed on\r\nout of the water, and instead of them there sat Festus Derriman alone on\r\nhis horse, and in plain clothes, the water reaching up to the animal\'s\r\nbelly, and Festus\' heels elevated over the saddle to keep them out of the\r\nstream, which threatened to wash rider and horse into the deep mill-head\r\njust below.  It was plainly he who had struck her lattice, for in a\r\nmoment he looked up, and their eyes met.  Festus laughed loudly, and\r\nslapped her window again; and just at that moment the dragoons began\r\nprancing down the slope in review order.  She could not but wait a minute\r\nor two to see them pass.  While doing so she was suddenly led to draw\r\nback, drop the corner of the curtain, and blush privately in her room.\r\nShe had not only been seen by Festus Derriman, but by John Loveday, who,\r\nriding along with his trumpet slung up behind him, had looked over his\r\nshoulder at the phenomenon of Derriman beneath Anne\'s bedroom window and\r\nseemed quite astounded at the sight.\r\n\r\nShe was quite vexed at the conjunction of incidents, and went no more to\r\nthe window till the dragoons had ridden far away and she had heard\r\nFestus\'s horse laboriously wade on to dry land.  When she looked out\r\nthere was nobody left but Miller Loveday, who usually stood in the garden\r\nat this time of the morning to say a word or two to the soldiers, of whom\r\nhe already knew so many, and was in a fair way of knowing many more, from\r\nthe liberality with which he handed round mugs of cheering liquor\r\nwhenever parties of them walked that way.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of this day Anne walked to a christening party at a\r\nneighbour\'s in the adjoining parish of Springham, intending to walk home\r\nagain before it got dark; but there was a slight fall of rain towards\r\nevening, and she was pressed by the people of the house to stay over the\r\nnight.  With some hesitation she accepted their hospitality; but at ten\r\no\'clock, when they were thinking of going to bed, they were startled by a\r\nsmart rap at the door, and on it being unbolted a man\'s form was seen in\r\nthe shadows outside.\r\n\r\n\'Is Miss Garland here?\' the visitor inquired, at which Anne suspended her\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Anne\'s entertainer, warily.\r\n\r\n\'Her mother is very anxious to know what\'s become of her.  She promised\r\nto come home.\'  To her great relief Anne recognized the voice as John\r\nLoveday\'s, and not Festus Derriman\'s.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I did, Mr. Loveday,\' said she, coming forward; \'but it rained, and\r\nI thought my mother would guess where I was.\'\r\n\r\nLoveday said with diffidence that it had not rained anything to speak of\r\nat the camp, or at the mill, so that her mother was rather alarmed.\r\n\r\n\'And she asked you to come for me?\' Anne inquired.\r\n\r\nThis was a question which the trumpet-major had been dreading during the\r\nwhole of his walk thither.  \'Well, she didn\'t exactly ask me,\' he said\r\nrather lamely, but still in a manner to show that Mrs. Garland had\r\nindirectly signified such to be her wish.  In reality Mrs. Garland had\r\nnot addressed him at all on the subject.  She had merely spoken to his\r\nfather on finding that her daughter did not return, and received an\r\nassurance from the miller that the precious girl was doubtless quite\r\nsafe.  John heard of this inquiry, and, having a pass that evening,\r\nresolved to relieve Mrs. Garland\'s mind on his own responsibility.  Ever\r\nsince his morning view of Festus under her window he had been on thorns\r\nof anxiety, and his thrilling hope now was that she would walk back with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe shifted his foot nervously as he made the bold request.  Anne felt at\r\nonce that she would go.  There was nobody in the world whose care she\r\nwould more readily be under than the trumpet-major\'s in a case like the\r\npresent.  He was their nearest neighbour\'s son, and she had liked his\r\nsingle-minded ingenuousness from the first moment of his return home.\r\n\r\nWhen they had started on their walk, Anne said in a practical way, to\r\nshow that there was no sentiment whatever in her acceptance of his\r\ncompany, \'Mother was much alarmed about me, perhaps?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; she was uneasy,\' he said; and then was compelled by conscience to\r\nmake a clean breast of it.  \'I know she was uneasy, because my father\r\nsaid so.  But I did not see her myself.  The truth is, she doesn\'t know I\r\nam come.\'\r\n\r\nAnne now saw how the matter stood; but she was not offended with him.\r\nWhat woman could have been?  They walked on in silence, the respectful\r\ntrumpet-major keeping a yard off on her right as precisely as if that\r\nmeasure had been fixed between them.  She had a great feeling of civility\r\ntoward him this evening, and spoke again.  \'I often hear your trumpeters\r\nblowing the calls.  They do it beautifully, I think.\'\r\n\r\n\'Pretty fair; they might do better,\' said he, as one too well-mannered to\r\nmake much of an accomplishment in which he had a hand.\r\n\r\n\'And you taught them how to do it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I taught them.\'\r\n\r\n\'It must require wonderful practice to get them into the way of beginning\r\nand finishing so exactly at one time.  It is like one throat doing it\r\nall.  How came you to be a trumpeter, Mr. Loveday?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I took to it naturally when I was a little boy,\' said he, betrayed\r\ninto quite a gushing state by her delightful interest.  \'I used to make\r\ntrumpets of paper, eldersticks, eltrot stems, and even stinging-nettle\r\nstalks, you know.  Then father set me to keep the birds off that little\r\nbarley-ground of his, and gave me an old horn to frighten \'em with.  I\r\nlearnt to blow that horn so that you could hear me for miles and miles.\r\nThen he bought me a clarionet, and when I could play that I borrowed a\r\nserpent, and I learned to play a tolerable bass.  So when I \'listed I was\r\npicked out for training as trumpeter at once.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course you were.\'\r\n\r\n\'Sometimes, however, I wish I had never joined the army.  My father gave\r\nme a very fair education, and your father showed me how to draw horses--on\r\na slate, I mean.  Yes, I ought to have done more than I have.\'\r\n\r\n\'What, did you know my father?\' she asked with new interest.\r\n\r\n\'O yes, for years.  You were a little mite of a thing then; and you used\r\nto cry when we big boys looked at you, and made pig\'s eyes at you, which\r\nwe did sometimes.  Many and many a time have I stood by your poor father\r\nwhile he worked.  Ah, you don\'t remember much about him; but I do!\'\r\n\r\nAnne remained thoughtful; and the moon broke from behind the clouds,\r\nlighting up the wet foliage with a twinkling brightness, and lending to\r\neach of the trumpet-major\'s buttons and spurs a little ray of its own.\r\nThey had come to Oxwell park gate, and he said, \'Do you like going\r\nacross, or round by the lane?\'\r\n\r\n\'We may as well go by the nearest road,\' said Anne.\r\n\r\nThey entered the park, following the half-obliterated drive till they\r\ncame almost opposite the hall, when they entered a footpath leading on to\r\nthe village.  While hereabout they heard a shout, or chorus of\r\nexclamation, apparently from within the walls of the dark buildings near\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\'What was that?\' said Anne.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know,\' said her companion.  \'I\'ll go and see.\'\r\n\r\nHe went round the intervening swamp of watercress and brooklime which had\r\nonce been the fish-pond, crossed by a culvert the trickling brook that\r\nstill flowed that way, and advanced to the wall of the house.  Boisterous\r\nnoises were resounding from within, and he was tempted to go round the\r\ncorner, where the low windows were, and look through a chink into the\r\nroom whence the sounds proceeded.\r\n\r\nIt was the room in which the owner dined--traditionally called the great\r\nparlour--and within it sat about a dozen young men of the yeomanry\r\ncavalry, one of them being Festus.  They were drinking, laughing,\r\nsinging, thumping their fists on the tables, and enjoying themselves in\r\nthe very perfection of confusion.  The candles, blown by the breeze from\r\nthe partly opened window, had guttered into coffin handles and shrouds,\r\nand, choked by their long black wicks for want of snuffing, gave out a\r\nsmoky yellow light.  One of the young men might possibly have been in a\r\nmaudlin state, for he had his arm round the neck of his next neighbour.\r\nAnother was making an incoherent speech to which nobody was listening.\r\nSome of their faces were red, some were sallow; some were sleepy, some\r\nwide awake.  The only one among them who appeared in his usual frame of\r\nmind was Festus, whose huge, burly form rose at the head of the table,\r\nenjoying with a serene and triumphant aspect the difference between his\r\nown condition and that of his neighbours.  While the trumpet-major\r\nlooked, a young woman, niece of Anthony Cripplestraw, and one of Uncle\r\nBenjy\'s servants, was called in by one of the crew, and much against her\r\nwill a fiddle was placed in her hands, from which they made her produce\r\ndiscordant screeches.\r\n\r\nThe absence of Uncle Benjy had, in fact, been contrived by young Derriman\r\nthat he might make use of the hall on his own account.  Cripplestraw had\r\nbeen left in charge, and Festus had found no difficulty in forcing from\r\nthat dependent the keys of whatever he required.  John Loveday turned his\r\neyes from the scene to the neighbouring moonlit path, where Anne still\r\nstood waiting.  Then he looked into the room, then at Anne again.  It was\r\nan opportunity of advancing his own cause with her by exposing Festus,\r\nfor whom he began to entertain hostile feelings of no mean force.\r\n\r\n\'No; I can\'t do it,\' he said.  \'\'Tis underhand.  Let things take their\r\nchance.\'\r\n\r\nHe moved away, and then perceived that Anne, tired of waiting, had\r\ncrossed the stream, and almost come up with him.\r\n\r\n\'What is the noise about?\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s company in the house,\' said Loveday.\r\n\r\n\'Company?  Farmer Derriman is not at home,\' said Anne, and went on to the\r\nwindow whence the rays of light leaked out, the trumpet-major standing\r\nwhere he was.  He saw her face enter the beam of candlelight, stay there\r\nfor a moment, and quickly withdraw.  She came back to him at once.  \'Let\r\nus go on,\' she said.\r\n\r\nLoveday imagined from her tone that she must have an interest in\r\nDerriman, and said sadly, \'You blame me for going across to the window,\r\nand leading you to follow me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not a bit,\' said Anne, seeing his mistake as to the state of her heart,\r\nand being rather angry with him for it.  \'I think it was most natural,\r\nconsidering the noise.\'\r\n\r\nSilence again.  \'Derriman is sober as a judge,\' said Loveday, as they\r\nturned to go.  \'It was only the others who were noisy.\'\r\n\r\n\'Whether he is sober or not is nothing whatever to me,\' said Anne.\r\n\r\n\'Of course not.  I know it,\' said the trumpet-major, in accents\r\nexpressing unhappiness at her somewhat curt tone, and some doubt of her\r\nassurance.\r\n\r\nBefore they had emerged from the shadow of the hall some persons were\r\nseen moving along the road.  Loveday was for going on just the same; but\r\nAnne, from a shy feeling that it was as well not to be seen walking alone\r\nwith a man who was not her lover, said--\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Loveday, let us wait here a minute till they have passed.\'\r\n\r\nOn nearer view the group was seen to comprise a man on a piebald horse,\r\nand another man walking beside him.  When they were opposite the house\r\nthey halted, and the rider dismounted, whereupon a dispute between him\r\nand the other man ensued, apparently on a question of money.\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis old Mr. Derriman come home!\' said Anne.  \'He has hired that horse\r\nfrom the bathing-machine to bring him.  Only fancy!\'\r\n\r\nBefore they had gone many steps further the farmer and his companion had\r\nended their dispute, and the latter mounted the horse and cantered away,\r\nUncle Benjy coming on to the house at a nimble pace.  As soon as he\r\nobserved Loveday and Anne, he fell into a feebler gait; when they came up\r\nhe recognized Anne.\r\n\r\n\'And you have torn yourself away from King George\'s Esplanade so soon,\r\nFarmer Derriman?\' said she.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, faith!  I couldn\'t bide at such a ruination place,\' said the\r\nfarmer.  \'Your hand in your pocket every minute of the day.  \'Tis a\r\nshilling for this, half-a-crown for that; if you only eat one egg, or\r\neven a poor windfall of an apple, you\'ve got to pay; and a bunch o\'\r\nradishes is a halfpenny, and a quart o\' cider a good tuppence\r\nthree-farthings at lowest reckoning.  Nothing without paying!  I couldn\'t\r\neven get a ride homeward upon that screw without the man wanting a\r\nshilling for it, when my weight didn\'t take a penny out of the beast.\r\nI\'ve saved a penn\'orth or so of shoeleather to be sure; but the saddle\r\nwas so rough wi\' patches that \'a took twopence out of the seat of my best\r\nbreeches.  King George hev\' ruined the town for other folks.  More than\r\nthat, my nephew promised to come there to-morrow to see me, and if I had\r\nstayed I must have treated en.  Hey--what\'s that?\'\r\n\r\nIt was a shout from within the walls of the building, and Loveday said--\r\n\r\n\'Your nephew is here, and has company.\'\r\n\r\n\'My nephew _here_?\' gasped the old man.  \'Good folks, will you come up to\r\nthe door with me?  I mean--hee--hee--just for company!  Dear me, I\r\nthought my house was as quiet as a church?\'\r\n\r\nThey went back to the window, and the farmer looked in, his mouth falling\r\napart to a greater width at the corners than in the middle, and his\r\nfingers assuming a state of radiation.\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis my best silver tankards they\'ve got, that I\'ve never used!  O! \'tis\r\nmy strong beer!  \'Tis eight candles guttering away, when I\'ve used\r\nnothing but twenties myself for the last half-year!\'\r\n\r\n\'You didn\'t know he was here, then?\' said Loveday.\r\n\r\n\'O no!\' said the farmer, shaking his head half-way.  \'Nothing\'s known to\r\npoor I!  There\'s my best rummers jingling as careless as if \'twas tin\r\ncups; and my table scratched, and my chairs wrenched out of joint.  See\r\nhow they tilt \'em on the two back legs--and that\'s ruin to a chair!  Ah!\r\nwhen I be gone he won\'t find another old man to make such work with, and\r\nprovide goods for his breaking, and house-room and drink for his tear-\r\nbrass set!\'\r\n\r\n\'Comrades and fellow-soldiers,\' said Festus to the hot farmers and yeomen\r\nhe entertained within, \'as we have vowed to brave danger and death\r\ntogether, so we\'ll share the couch of peace.  You shall sleep here to-\r\nnight, for it is getting late.  My scram blue-vinnied gallicrow of an\r\nuncle takes care that there shan\'t be much comfort in the house, but you\r\ncan curl up on the furniture if beds run short.  As for my sleep, it\r\nwon\'t be much.  I\'m melancholy!  A woman has, I may say, got my heart in\r\nher pocket, and I have hers in mine.  She\'s not much--to other folk, I\r\nmean--but she is to me.  The little thing came in my way, and conquered\r\nme.  I fancy that simple girl!  I ought to have looked higher--I know it;\r\nwhat of that?  \'Tis a fate that may happen to the greatest men.\'\r\n\r\n\'Whash her name?\' said one of the warriors, whose head occasionally\r\ndrooped upon his epaulettes, and whose eyes fell together in the casual\r\nmanner characteristic of the tired soldier.  (It was really Farmer Stubb,\r\nof Duddle Hole.)\r\n\r\n\'Her name?  Well, \'tis spelt, A, N--but, by gad, I won\'t give ye her name\r\nhere in company.  She don\'t live a hundred miles off, however, and she\r\nwears the prettiest cap-ribbons you ever saw.  Well, well, \'tis weakness!\r\nShe has little, and I have much; but I do adore that girl, in spite of\r\nmyself!\'\r\n\r\n\'Let\'s go on,\' said Anne.\r\n\r\n\'Prithee stand by an old man till he\'s got into his house!\' implored\r\nUncle Benjy.  \'I only ask ye to bide within call.  Stand back under the\r\ntrees, and I\'ll do my poor best to give no trouble.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll stand by you for half-an-hour, sir,\' said Loveday.  \'After that I\r\nmust bolt to camp.\'\r\n\r\n\'Very well; bide back there under the trees,\' said Uncle Benjy.  \'I don\'t\r\nwant to spite \'em?\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll wait a few minutes, just to see if he gets in?\' said the trumpet-\r\nmajor to Anne as they retired from the old man.\r\n\r\n\'I want to get home,\' said Anne anxiously.\r\n\r\nWhen they had quite receded behind the tree-trunks and he stood alone,\r\nUncle Benjy, to their surprise, set up a loud shout, altogether beyond\r\nthe imagined power of his lungs.\r\n\r\n\'Man a-lost! man a-lost!\' he cried, repeating the exclamation several\r\ntimes; and then ran and hid himself behind a corner of the building.  Soon\r\nthe door opened, and Festus and his guests came tumbling out upon the\r\ngreen.\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis our duty to help folks in distress,\' said Festus.  \'Man a-lost,\r\nwhere are you?\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Twas across there,\' said one of his friends.\r\n\r\n\'No! \'twas here,\' said another.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Uncle Benjy, coming from his hiding-place, had scampered with\r\nthe quickness of a boy up to the door they had quitted, and slipped in.\r\nIn a moment the door flew together, and Anne heard him bolting and\r\nbarring it inside.  The revellers, however, did not notice this, and came\r\non towards the spot where the trumpet-major and Anne were standing.\r\n\r\n\'Here\'s succour at hand, friends,\' said Festus.  \'We are all king\'s men;\r\ndo not fear us.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you,\' said Loveday; \'so are we.\'  He explained in two words that\r\nthey were not the distressed traveller who had cried out, and turned to\r\ngo on.\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis she! my life, \'tis she said Festus, now first recognizing Anne.\r\n\'Fair Anne, I will not part from you till I see you safe at your own dear\r\ndoor.\'\r\n\r\n\'She\'s in my hands,\' said Loveday civilly, though not without firmness,\r\n\'so it is not required, thank you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Man, had I but my sword--\'\r\n\r\n\'Come,\' said Loveday, \'I don\'t want to quarrel.  Let\'s put it to her.\r\nWhichever of us she likes best, he shall take her home.  Miss Anne,\r\nwhich?\'\r\n\r\nAnne would much rather have gone home alone, but seeing the remainder of\r\nthe yeomanry party staggering up she thought it best to secure a\r\nprotector of some kind.  How to choose one without offending the other\r\nand provoking a quarrel was the difficulty.\r\n\r\n\'You must both walk home with me,\' she adroitly said, \'one on one side,\r\nand one on the other.  And if you are not quite civil to one another all\r\nthe time, I\'ll never speak to either of you again.\'\r\n\r\nThey agreed to the terms, and the other yeomen arriving at this time said\r\nthey would go also as rearguard.\r\n\r\n\'Very well,\' said Anne.  \'Now go and get your hats, and don\'t be long.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, yes; our hats,\' said the yeomanry, whose heads were so hot that they\r\nhad forgotten their nakedness till then.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll wait till we\'ve got \'em--we won\'t be a moment,\' said Festus\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\nAnne and Loveday said yes, and Festus ran back to the house, followed by\r\nall his band.\r\n\r\n\'Now let\'s run and leave \'em,\' said Anne, when they were out of hearing.\r\n\r\n\'But we\'ve promised to wait!\' said the trumpet-major in surprise.\r\n\r\n\'Promised to wait!\' said Anne indignantly.  \'As if one ought to keep such\r\na promise to drunken men as that.  You can do as you like, I shall go.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is hardly fair to leave the chaps,\' said Loveday reluctantly, and\r\nlooking back at them.  But she heard no more, and flitting off under the\r\ntrees, was soon lost to his sight.\r\n\r\nFestus and the rest had by this time reached Uncle Benjy\'s door, which\r\nthey were discomfited and astonished to find closed.  They began to\r\nknock, and then to kick at the venerable timber, till the old man\'s head,\r\ncrowned with a tasselled nightcap, appeared at an upper window, followed\r\nby his shoulders, with apparently nothing on but his shirt, though it was\r\nin truth a sheet thrown over his coat.\r\n\r\n\'Fie, fie upon ye all for making such a hullaballoo at a weak old man\'s\r\ndoor,\' he said, yawning.  \'What\'s in ye to rouse honest folks at this\r\ntime o\' night?\'\r\n\r\n\'Hang me--why--it\'s Uncle Benjy!  Haw--haw--haw?\' said Festus.  \'Nunc,\r\nwhy how the devil\'s this?  \'Tis I--Festus--wanting to come in.\'\r\n\r\n\'O no, no, my clever man, whoever you be!\' said Uncle Benjy in a tone of\r\nincredulous integrity.  \'My nephew, dear boy, is miles away at quarters,\r\nand sound asleep by this time, as becomes a good soldier.  That story\r\nwon\'t do to-night, my man, not at all.\'\r\n\r\n\'Upon my soul \'tis I,\' said Festus.\r\n\r\n\'Not to-night, my man; not to-night!  Anthony, bring my blunderbuss,\'\r\nsaid the farmer, turning and addressing nobody inside the room.\r\n\r\n\'Let\'s break in the window-shutters,\' said one of the others.\r\n\r\n\'My wig, and we will!\' said Festus.  \'What a trick of the old man!\'\r\n\r\n\'Get some big stones,\' said the yeomen, searching under the wall.\r\n\r\n\'No; forbear, forbear,\' said Festus, beginning to be frightened at the\r\nspirit he had raised.  \'I forget; we should drive him into fits, for he\'s\r\nsubject to \'em, and then perhaps \'twould be manslaughter.  Comrades, we\r\nmust march!  No, we\'ll lie in the barn.  I\'ll see into this, take my word\r\nfor \'t.  Our honour is at stake.  Now let\'s back to see my beauty home.\'\r\n\r\n\'We can\'t, as we hav\'n\'t got our hats,\' said one of his\r\nfellow-troopers--in domestic life Jacob Noakes, of Muckleford Farm.\r\n\r\n\'No more we can,\' said Festus, in a melancholy tone.  \'But I must go to\r\nher and tell her the reason.  She pulls me in spite of all.\'\r\n\r\n\'She\'s gone.  I saw her flee across park while we were knocking at the\r\ndoor,\' said another of the yeomanry.\r\n\r\n\'Gone!\' said Festus, grinding his teeth and putting himself into a rigid\r\nshape.  \'Then \'tis my enemy--he has tempted her away with him!  But I am\r\na rich man, and he\'s poor, and rides the King\'s horse while I ride my\r\nown.  Could I but find that fellow, that regular, that common man, I\r\nwould--\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes?\' said the trumpet-major, coming up behind him.\r\n\r\n\'I,\'--said Festus, starting round,--\'I would seize him by the hand and\r\nsay, "Guard her; if you are my friend, guard her from all harm!"\'\r\n\r\n\'A good speech.  And I will, too,\' said Loveday heartily.\r\n\r\n\'And now for shelter,\' said Festus to his companions.\r\n\r\nThey then unceremoniously left Loveday, without wishing him good-night,\r\nand proceeded towards the barn.  He crossed the park and ascended the\r\ndown to the camp, grieved that he had given Anne cause of complaint, and\r\nfancying that she held him of slight account beside his wealthier rival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. THE MATCH-MAKING VIRTUES OF A DOUBLE GARDEN\r\n\r\n\r\nAnne was so flurried by the military incidents attending her return home\r\nthat she was almost afraid to venture alone outside her mother\'s\r\npremises.  Moreover, the numerous soldiers, regular and otherwise, that\r\nhaunted Overcombe and its neighbourhood, were getting better acquainted\r\nwith the villagers, and the result was that they were always standing at\r\ngarden gates, walking in the orchards, or sitting gossiping just within\r\ncottage doors, with the bowls of their tobacco-pipes thrust outside for\r\npoliteness\' sake, that they might not defile the air of the household.\r\nBeing gentlemen of a gallant and most affectionate nature, they naturally\r\nturned their heads and smiled if a pretty girl passed by, which was\r\nrather disconcerting to the latter if she were unused to society.  Every\r\nbelle in the village soon had a lover, and when the belles were all\r\nallotted those who scarcely deserved that title had their turn, many of\r\nthe soldiers being not at all particular about half-an-inch of nose more\r\nor less, a trifling deficiency of teeth, or a larger crop of freckles\r\nthan is customary in the Saxon race.  Thus, with one and another,\r\ncourtship began to be practised in Overcombe on rather a large scale, and\r\nthe dispossessed young men who had been born in the place were left to\r\ntake their walks alone, where, instead of studying the works of nature,\r\nthey meditated gross outrages on the brave men who had been so good as to\r\nvisit their village.\r\n\r\nAnne watched these romantic proceedings from her window with much\r\ninterest, and when she saw how triumphantly other handsome girls of the\r\nneighbourhood walked by on the gorgeous arms of Lieutenant Knockheelmann,\r\nCornet Flitzenhart, and Captain Klaspenkissen, of the thrilling York\r\nHussars, who swore the most picturesque foreign oaths, and had a\r\nwonderful sort of estate or property called the Vaterland in their\r\ncountry across the sea, she was filled with a sense of her own\r\nloneliness.  It made her think of things which she tried to forget, and\r\nto look into a little drawer at something soft and brown that lay in a\r\ncurl there, wrapped in paper.  At last she could bear it no longer, and\r\nwent downstairs.\r\n\r\n\'Where are you going?\' said Mrs. Garland.\r\n\r\n\'To see the folks, because I am so gloomy!\'\r\n\r\n\'Certainly not at present, Anne.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why not, mother?\' said Anne, blushing with an indefinite sense of being\r\nvery wicked.\r\n\r\n\'Because you must not.  I have been going to tell you several times not\r\nto go into the street at this time of day.  Why not walk in the morning?\r\nThere\'s young Mr. Derriman would be glad to--\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t mention him, mother, don\'t!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well then, dear, walk in the garden.\'\r\n\r\nSo poor Anne, who really had not the slightest wish to throw her heart\r\naway upon a soldier, but merely wanted to displace old thoughts by new,\r\nturned into the inner garden from day to day, and passed a good many\r\nhours there, the pleasant birds singing to her, and the delightful\r\nbutterflies alighting on her hat, and the horrid ants running up her\r\nstockings.\r\n\r\nThis garden was undivided from Loveday\'s, the two having originally been\r\nthe single garden of the whole house.  It was a quaint old place,\r\nenclosed by a thorn hedge so shapely and dense from incessant clipping\r\nthat the mill-boy could walk along the top without sinking in--a feat\r\nwhich he often performed as a means of filling out his day\'s work.  The\r\nsoil within was of that intense fat blackness which is only seen after a\r\ncentury of constant cultivation.  The paths were grassed over, so that\r\npeople came and went upon them without being heard.  The grass harboured\r\nslugs, and on this account the miller was going to replace it by gravel\r\nas soon as he had time; but as he had said this for thirty years without\r\ndoing it, the grass and the slugs seemed likely to remain.\r\n\r\nThe miller\'s man attended to Mrs. Garland\'s piece of the garden as well\r\nas to the larger portion, digging, planting, and weeding indifferently in\r\nboth, the miller observing with reason that it was not worth while for a\r\nhelpless widow lady to hire a man for her little plot when his man,\r\nworking alongside, could tend it without much addition to his labour.  The\r\ntwo households were on this account even more closely united in the\r\ngarden than within the mill.  Out there they were almost one family, and\r\nthey talked from plot to plot with a zest and animation which Mrs.\r\nGarland could never have anticipated when she first removed thither after\r\nher husband\'s death.\r\n\r\nThe lower half of the garden, farthest from the road, was the most snug\r\nand sheltered part of this snug and sheltered enclosure, and it was well\r\nwatered as the land of Lot.  Three small brooks, about a yard wide, ran\r\nwith a tinkling sound from side to side between the plots, crossing the\r\npath under wood slabs laid as bridges, and passing out of the garden\r\nthrough little tunnels in the hedge.  The brooks were so far overhung at\r\ntheir brinks by grass and garden produce that, had it not been for their\r\nperpetual babbling, few would have noticed that they were there.  This\r\nwas where Anne liked best to linger when her excursions became restricted\r\nto her own premises; and in a spot of the garden not far removed the\r\ntrumpet-major loved to linger also.\r\n\r\nHaving by virtue of his office no stable duty to perform, he came down\r\nfrom the camp to the mill almost every day; and Anne, finding that he\r\nadroitly walked and sat in his father\'s portion of the garden whenever\r\nshe did so in the other half, could not help smiling and speaking to him.\r\nSo his epaulettes and blue jacket, and Anne\'s yellow gipsy hat, were\r\noften seen in different parts of the garden at the same time; but he\r\nnever intruded into her part of the enclosure, nor did she into\r\nLoveday\'s.  She always spoke to him when she saw him there, and he\r\nreplied in deep, firm accents across the gooseberry bushes, or through\r\nthe tall rows of flowering peas, as the case might be.  He thus gave her\r\naccounts at fifteen paces of his experiences in camp, in quarters, in\r\nFlanders, and elsewhere; of the difference between line and column, of\r\nforced marches, billeting, and such-like, together with his hopes of\r\npromotion.  Anne listened at first indifferently; but knowing no one else\r\nso good-natured and experienced, she grew interested in him as in a\r\nbrother.  By degrees his gold lace, buckles, and spurs lost all their\r\nstrangeness and were as familiar to her as her own clothes.\r\n\r\nAt last Mrs. Garland noticed this growing friendship, and began to\r\ndespair of her motherly scheme of uniting Anne to the moneyed Festus.  Why\r\nshe could not take prompt steps to check interference with her plans\r\narose partly from her nature, which was the reverse of managing, and\r\npartly from a new emotional circumstance with which she found it\r\ndifficult to reckon.  The near neighbourhood that had produced the\r\nfriendship of Anne for John Loveday was slowly effecting a warmer liking\r\nbetween her mother and his father.\r\n\r\nThus the month of July passed.  The troop horses came with the regularity\r\nof clockwork twice a day down to drink under her window, and, as the\r\nweather grew hotter, kicked up their heels and shook their heads\r\nfuriously under the maddening sting of the dun-fly.  The green leaves in\r\nthe garden became of a darker dye, the gooseberries ripened, and the\r\nthree brooks were reduced to half their winter volume.\r\n\r\nAt length the earnest trumpet-major obtained Mrs. Garland\'s consent to\r\ntake her and her daughter to the camp, which they had not yet viewed from\r\nany closer point than their own windows.  So one afternoon they went, the\r\nmiller being one of the party.  The villagers were by this time driving a\r\nroaring trade with the soldiers, who purchased of them every description\r\nof garden produce, milk, butter, and eggs at liberal prices.  The figures\r\nof these rural sutlers could be seen creeping up the slopes, laden like\r\nbees, to a spot in the rear of the camp, where there was a kind of market-\r\nplace on the greensward.\r\n\r\nMrs. Garland, Anne, and the miller were conducted from one place to\r\nanother, and on to the quarter where the soldiers\' wives lived who had\r\nnot been able to get lodgings in the cottages near.  The most sheltered\r\nplace had been chosen for them, and snug huts had been built for their\r\nuse by their husbands, of clods, hurdles, a little thatch, or whatever\r\nthey could lay hands on.  The trumpet-major conducted his friends thence\r\nto the large barn which had been appropriated as a hospital, and to the\r\ncottage with its windows bricked up, that was used as the magazine; then\r\nthey inspected the lines of shining dark horses (each representing the\r\nthen high figure of two-and-twenty guineas purchase money), standing\r\npatiently at the ropes which stretched from one picket-post to another, a\r\nbank being thrown up in front of them as a protection at night.\r\n\r\nThey passed on to the tents of the German Legion, a well-grown and rather\r\ndandy set of men, with a poetical look about their faces which rendered\r\nthem interesting to feminine eyes.  Hanoverians, Saxons, Prussians,\r\nSwedes, Hungarians, and other foreigners were numbered in their ranks.\r\nThey were cleaning arms, which they leant carefully against a rail when\r\nthe work was complete.\r\n\r\nOn their return they passed the mess-house, a temporary wooden building\r\nwith a brick chimney.  As Anne and her companions went by, a group of\r\nthree or four of the hussars were standing at the door talking to a\r\ndashing young man, who was expatiating on the qualities of a horse that\r\none was inclined to buy.  Anne recognized Festus Derriman in the seller,\r\nand Cripplestraw was trotting the animal up and down.  As soon as she\r\ncaught the yeoman\'s eye he came forward, making some friendly remark to\r\nthe miller, and then turning to Miss Garland, who kept her eyes steadily\r\nfixed on the distant landscape till he got so near that it was impossible\r\nto do so longer.  Festus looked from Anne to the trumpet-major, and from\r\nthe trumpet-major back to Anne, with a dark expression of face, as if he\r\nsuspected that there might be a tender understanding between them.\r\n\r\n\'Are you offended with me?\' he said to her in a low voice of repressed\r\nresentment.\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said Anne.\r\n\r\n\'When are you coming to the hall again?\'\r\n\r\n\'Never, perhaps.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nonsense, Anne,\' said Mrs. Garland, who had come near, and smiled\r\npleasantly on Festus.  \'You can go at any time, as usual.\'\r\n\r\n\'Let her come with me now, Mrs. Garland; I should be pleased to walk\r\nalong with her.  My man can lead home the horse.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, but I shall not come,\' said Miss Anne coldly.\r\n\r\nThe widow looked unhappily in her daughter\'s face, distressed between her\r\ndesire that Anne should encourage Festus, and her wish to consult Anne\'s\r\nown feelings.\r\n\r\n\'Leave her alone, leave her alone,\' said Festus, his gaze blackening.\r\n\'Now I think of it I am glad she can\'t come with me, for I am engaged;\'\r\nand he stalked away.\r\n\r\nAnne moved on with her mother, young Loveday silently following, and they\r\nbegan to descend the hill.\r\n\r\n\'Well, where\'s Mr. Loveday?\' asked Mrs. Garland.\r\n\r\n\'Father\'s behind,\' said John.\r\n\r\nMrs. Garland looked behind her solicitously; and the miller, who had been\r\nwaiting for the event, beckoned to her.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll overtake you in a minute,\' she said to the younger pair, and went\r\nback, her colour, for some unaccountable reason, rising as she did so.\r\nThe miller and she then came on slowly together, conversing in very low\r\ntones, and when they got to the bottom they stood still.  Loveday and\r\nAnne waited for them, saying but little to each other, for the rencounter\r\nwith Festus had damped the spirits of both.  At last the widow\'s private\r\ntalk with Miller Loveday came to an end, and she hastened onward, the\r\nmiller going in another direction to meet a man on business.  When she\r\nreached the trumpet-major and Anne she was looking very bright and rather\r\nflurried, and seemed sorry when Loveday said that he must leave them and\r\nreturn to the camp.  They parted in their usual friendly manner, and Anne\r\nand her mother were left to walk the few remaining yards alone.\r\n\r\n\'There, I\'ve settled it,\' said Mrs. Garland.  \'Anne, what are you\r\nthinking about?  I have settled in my mind that it is all right.\'\r\n\r\n\'What\'s all right?\' said Anne.\r\n\r\n\'That you do not care for Derriman, and mean to encourage John Loveday.\r\nWhat\'s all the world so long as folks are happy!  Child, don\'t take any\r\nnotice of what I have said about Festus, and don\'t meet him any more.\'\r\n\r\n\'What a weathercock you are, mother!  Why should you say that just now?\'\r\n\r\n\'It is easy to call me a weathercock,\' said the matron, putting on the\r\nlook of a good woman; \'but I have reasoned it out, and at last, thank\r\nGod, I have got over my ambition.  The Lovedays are our true and only\r\nfriends, and Mr. Festus Derriman, with all his money, is nothing to us at\r\nall.\'\r\n\r\n\'But,\' said Anne, \'what has made you change all of a sudden from what you\r\nhave said before?\'\r\n\r\n\'My feelings and my reason, which I am thankful for!\'\r\n\r\nAnne knew that her mother\'s sentiments were naturally so versatile that\r\nthey could not be depended on for two days together; but it did not occur\r\nto her for the moment that a change had been helped on in the present\r\ncase by a romantic talk between Mrs. Garland and the miller.  But Mrs.\r\nGarland could not keep the secret long.  She chatted gaily as she walked,\r\nand before they had entered the house she said, \'What do you think Mr\r\nLoveday has been saying to me, dear Anne?\'\r\n\r\nAnne did not know at all.\r\n\r\n\'Why, he has asked me to marry him.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.  OUR PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED BY THE PRESENCE OF ROYALTY\r\n\r\n\r\nTo explain the miller\'s sudden proposal it is only necessary to go back\r\nto that moment when Anne, Festus, and Mrs. Garland were talking together\r\non the down.  John Loveday had fallen behind so as not to interfere with\r\na meeting in which he was decidedly superfluous; and his father, who\r\nguessed the trumpet-major\'s secret, watched his face as he stood.  John\'s\r\nface was sad, and his eyes followed Mrs. Garland\'s encouraging manner to\r\nFestus in a way which plainly said that every parting of her lips was\r\ntribulation to him.  The miller loved his son as much as any miller or\r\nprivate gentleman could do, and he was pained to see John\'s gloom at such\r\na trivial circumstance.  So what did he resolve but to help John there\r\nand then by precipitating a matter which, had he himself been the only\r\nperson concerned, he would have delayed for another six months.\r\n\r\nHe had long liked the society of his impulsive, tractable neighbour, Mrs.\r\nGarland; had mentally taken her up and pondered her in connexion with the\r\nquestion whether it would not be for the happiness of both if she were to\r\nshare his home, even though she was a little his superior in antecedents\r\nand knowledge.  In fact he loved her; not tragically, but to a very\r\ncreditable extent for his years; that is, next to his sons, Bob and John,\r\nthough he knew very well of that ploughed-ground appearance near the\r\ncorners of her once handsome eyes, and that the little depression in her\r\nright cheek was not the lingering dimple it was poetically assumed to be,\r\nbut a result of the abstraction of some worn-out nether millstones within\r\nthe cheek by Rootle, the Budmouth man, who lived by such practices on the\r\nheads of the elderly.  But what of that, when he had lost two to each one\r\nof hers, and exceeded her in age by some eight years!  To do John a\r\nservice, then, he quickened his designs, and put the question to her\r\nwhile they were standing under the eyes of the younger pair.\r\n\r\nMrs. Garland, though she had been interested in the miller for a long\r\ntime, and had for a moment now and then thought on this question as far\r\nas, \'Suppose he should, \'If he were to,\' and so on, had never thought\r\nmuch further; and she was really taken by surprise when the question\r\ncame.  She answered without affectation that she would think over the\r\nproposal; and thus they parted.\r\n\r\nHer mother\'s infirmity of purpose set Anne thinking, and she was suddenly\r\nfilled with a conviction that in such a case she ought to have some\r\npurpose herself.  Mrs. Garland\'s complacency at the miller\'s offer had,\r\nin truth, amazed her.  While her mother had held up her head, and\r\nrecommended Festus, it had seemed a very pretty thing to rebel; but the\r\npressure being removed an awful sense of her own responsibility took\r\npossession of her mind.  As there was no longer anybody to be wise or\r\nambitious for her, surely she should be wise and ambitious for herself,\r\ndiscountenance her mother\'s attachment, and encourage Festus in his\r\naddresses, for her own and her mother\'s good.  There had been a time when\r\na Loveday thrilled her own heart; but that was long ago, before she had\r\nthought of position or differences.  To wake into cold daylight like\r\nthis, when and because her mother had gone into the land of romance, was\r\ndreadful and new to her, and like an increase of years without living\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut it was easier to think that she ought to marry the yeoman than to\r\ntake steps for doing it; and she went on living just as before, only with\r\na little more thoughtfulness in her eyes.\r\n\r\nTwo days after the visit to the camp, when she was again in the garden,\r\nSoldier Loveday said to her, at a distance of five rows of beans and a\r\nparsley-bed--\r\n\r\n\'You have heard the news, Miss Garland?\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said Anne, without looking up from a book she was reading.\r\n\r\n\'The King is coming to-morrow.\'\r\n\r\n\'The King?\' She looked up then.\r\n\r\n\'Yes; to Gloucester Lodge; and he will pass this way.  He can\'t arrive\r\ntill long past the middle of the night, if what they say is true, that he\r\nis timed to change horses at Woodyates Inn--between Mid and South\r\nWessex--at twelve o\'clock,\' continued Loveday, encouraged by her interest\r\nto cut off the parsley-bed from the distance between them.\r\n\r\nMiller Loveday came round the corner of the house.\r\n\r\n\'Have ye heard about the King coming, Miss Maidy Anne?\' he said.\r\n\r\nAnne said that she had just heard of it; and the trumpet-major, who\r\nhardly welcomed his father at such a moment, explained what he knew of\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n\'And you will go with your regiment to meet \'en, I suppose?\' said old\r\nLoveday.\r\n\r\nYoung Loveday said that the men of the German Legion were to perform that\r\nduty.  And turning half from his father, and half towards Anne, he added,\r\nin a tentative tone, that he thought he might get leave for the night, if\r\nanybody would like to be taken to the top of the Ridgeway over which the\r\nroyal party must pass.\r\n\r\nAnne, knowing by this time of the budding hope in the gallant dragoon\'s\r\nmind, and not wishing to encourage it, said, \'I don\'t want to go.\'\r\n\r\nThe miller looked disappointed as well as John.\r\n\r\n\'Your mother might like to?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I am going indoors, and I\'ll ask her if you wish me to,\' said she.\r\n\r\nShe went indoors and rather coldly told her mother of the proposal.  Mrs.\r\nGarland, though she had determined not to answer the miller\'s question on\r\nmatrimony just yet, was quite ready for this jaunt, and in spite of Anne\r\nshe sailed off at once to the garden to hear more about it.  When she re-\r\nentered, she said--\r\n\r\n\'Anne, I have not seen the King or the King\'s horses for these many\r\nyears; and I am going.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, it is well to be you, mother,\' said Anne, in an elderly tone.\r\n\r\n\'Then you won\'t come with us?\' said Mrs. Garland, rather rebuffed.\r\n\r\n\'I have very different things to think of,\' said her daughter with\r\nvirtuous emphasis, \'than going to see sights at that time of night.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Garland was sorry, but resolved to adhere to the arrangement.  The\r\nnight came on; and it having gone abroad that the King would pass by the\r\nroad, many of the villagers went out to see the procession.  When the two\r\nLovedays and Mrs. Garland were gone, Anne bolted the door for security,\r\nand sat down to think again on her grave responsibilities in the choice\r\nof a husband, now that her natural guardian could no longer be trusted.\r\n\r\nA knock came to the door.\r\n\r\nAnne\'s instinct was at once to be silent, that the comer might think the\r\nfamily had retired.\r\n\r\nThe knocking person, however, was not to be easily persuaded.  He had in\r\nfact seen rays of light over the top of the shutter, and, unable to get\r\nan answer, went on to the door of the mill, which was still going, the\r\nmiller sometimes grinding all night when busy.  The grinder accompanied\r\nthe stranger to Mrs. Garland\'s door.\r\n\r\n\'The daughter is certainly at home, sir,\' said the grinder.  \'I\'ll go\r\nround to t\'other side, and see if she\'s there, Master Derriman.\'\r\n\r\n\'I want to take her out to see the King,\' said Festus.\r\n\r\nAnne had started at the sound of the voice.  No opportunity could have\r\nbeen better for carrying out her new convictions on the disposal of her\r\nhand.  But in her mortal dislike of Festus, Anne forgot her principles,\r\nand her idea of keeping herself above the Lovedays.  Tossing on her hat\r\nand blowing out the candle, she slipped out at the back door, and hastily\r\nfollowed in the direction that her mother and the rest had taken.  She\r\novertook them as they were beginning to climb the hill.\r\n\r\n\'What! you have altered your mind after all?\' said the widow.  \'How came\r\nyou to do that, my dear?\'\r\n\r\n\'I thought I might as well come,\' said Anne.\r\n\r\n\'To be sure you did,\' said the miller heartily.  \'A good deal better than\r\nbiding at home there.\'\r\n\r\nJohn said nothing, though she could almost see through the gloom how glad\r\nhe was that she had altered her mind.  When they reached the ridge over\r\nwhich the highway stretched they found many of their neighbours who had\r\ngot there before them idling on the grass border between the roadway and\r\nthe hedge, enjoying a sort of midnight picnic, which it was easy to do,\r\nthe air being still and dry.  Some carriages were also standing near,\r\nthough most people of the district who possessed four wheels, or even\r\ntwo, had driven into the town to await the King there.  From this height\r\ncould be seen in the distance the position of the watering-place, an\r\nadditional number of lanterns, lamps, and candles having been lighted to-\r\nnight by the loyal burghers to grace the royal entry, if it should occur\r\nbefore dawn.\r\n\r\nMrs. Garland touched Anne\'s elbow several times as they walked, and the\r\nyoung woman at last understood that this was meant as a hint to her to\r\ntake the trumpet-major\'s arm, which its owner was rather suggesting than\r\noffering to her.  Anne wondered what infatuation was possessing her\r\nmother, declined to take the arm, and contrived to get in front with the\r\nmiller, who mostly kept in the van to guide the others\' footsteps.  The\r\ntrumpet-major was left with Mrs. Garland, and Anne\'s encouraging pursuit\r\nof them induced him to say a few words to the former.\r\n\r\n\'By your leave, ma\'am, I\'ll speak to you on something that concerns my\r\nmind very much indeed?\'\r\n\r\n\'Certainly.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is my wish to be allowed to pay my addresses to your daughter.\'\r\n\r\n\'I thought you meant that,\' said Mrs. Garland simply.\r\n\r\n\'And you\'ll not object?\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall leave it to her.  I don\'t think she will agree, even if I do.\'\r\n\r\nThe soldier sighed, and seemed helpless.  \'Well, I can but ask her,\' he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThe spot on which they had finally chosen to wait for the King was by a\r\nfield gate, whence the white road could be seen for a long distance\r\nnorthwards by day, and some little distance now.  They lingered and\r\nlingered, but no King came to break the silence of that beautiful summer\r\nnight.  As half-hour after half-hour glided by, and nobody came, Anne\r\nbegan to get weary; she knew why her mother did not propose to go back,\r\nand regretted the reason.  She would have proposed it herself, but that\r\nMrs. Garland seemed so cheerful, and as wide awake as at noonday, so that\r\nit was almost a cruelty to disturb her.\r\n\r\nThe trumpet-major at last made up his mind, and tried to draw Anne into a\r\nprivate conversation.  The feeling which a week ago had been a vague and\r\npiquant aspiration, was to-day altogether too lively for the reasoning of\r\nthis warm-hearted soldier to regulate.  So he persevered in his intention\r\nto catch her alone, and at last, in spite of her manoeuvres to the\r\ncontrary, he succeeded.  The miller and Mrs. Garland had walked about\r\nfifty yards further on, and Anne and himself were left standing by the\r\ngate.\r\n\r\nBut the gallant musician\'s soul was so much disturbed by tender\r\nvibrations and by the sense of his presumption that he could not begin;\r\nand it may be questioned if he would ever have broached the subject at\r\nall, had not a distant church clock opportunely assisted him by striking\r\nthe hour of three.  The trumpet-major heaved a breath of relief.\r\n\r\n\'That clock strikes in G sharp,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'Indeed--G sharp?\' said Anne civilly.\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  \'Tis a fine-toned bell.  I used to notice that note when I was a\r\nboy.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did you--the very same?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; and since then I had a wager about that bell with the bandmaster of\r\nthe North Wessex Militia.  He said the note was G; I said it wasn\'t.  When\r\nwe found it G sharp we didn\'t know how to settle it.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is not a deep note for a clock.\'\r\n\r\n\'O no!  The finest tenor bell about here is the bell of Peter\'s,\r\nCasterbridge--in E flat.  Tum-m-m-m--that\'s the note--tum-m-m-m.\'  The\r\ntrumpet-major sounded from far down his throat what he considered to be E\r\nflat, with a parenthetic sense of luxury unquenchable even by his present\r\ndistraction.\r\n\r\n\'Shall we go on to where my mother is?\' said Anne, less impressed by the\r\nbeauty of the note than the trumpet-major himself was.\r\n\r\n\'In one minute,\' he said tremulously.  \'Talking of music--I fear you\r\ndon\'t think the rank of a trumpet-major much to compare with your own?\'\r\n\r\n\'I do.  I think a trumpet-major a very respectable man.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am glad to hear you say that.  It is given out by the King\'s command\r\nthat trumpet-majors are to be considered respectable.\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed!  Then I am, by chance, more loyal than I thought for.\'\r\n\r\n\'I get a good deal a year extra to the trumpeters, because of my\r\nposition.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s very nice.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I am not supposed ever to drink with the trumpeters who serve\r\nbeneath me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Naturally.\'\r\n\r\n\'And, by the orders of the War Office, I am to exert over them (that\'s\r\nthe government word) exert over them full authority; and if any one\r\nbehaves towards me with the least impropriety, or neglects my orders, he\r\nis to be confined and reported.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is really a dignified post,\' she said, with, however, a reserve of\r\nenthusiasm which was not altogether encouraging.\r\n\r\n\'And of course some day I shall,\' stammered the dragoon--\'shall be in\r\nrather a better position than I am at present.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am glad to hear it, Mr. Loveday.\'\r\n\r\n\'And in short, Mistress Anne,\' continued John Loveday bravely and\r\ndesperately, \'may I pay court to you in the hope that--no, no, don\'t go\r\naway!--you haven\'t heard yet--that you may make me the happiest of men;\r\nnot yet, but when peace is proclaimed and all is smooth and easy again?  I\r\ncan\'t put it any better, though there\'s more to be explained.\'\r\n\r\n\'This is most awkward,\' said Anne, evidently with pain.  \'I cannot\r\npossibly agree; believe me, Mr. Loveday, I cannot.\'\r\n\r\n\'But there\'s more than this.  You would be surprised to see what snug\r\nrooms the married trumpet- and sergeant-majors have in quarters.\'\r\n\r\n\'Barracks are not all; consider camp and war.\'\r\n\r\n\'That brings me to my strong point!\' exclaimed the soldier hopefully.  \'My\r\nfather is better off than most non-commissioned officers\' fathers; and\r\nthere\'s always a home for you at his house in any emergency.  I can tell\r\nyou privately that he has enough to keep us both, and if you wouldn\'t\r\nhear of barracks, well, peace once established, I\'d live at home as a\r\nmiller and farmer--next door to your own mother.\'\r\n\r\n\'My mother would be sure to object,\' expostulated Anne.\r\n\r\n\'No; she leaves it all to you.\'\r\n\r\n\'What! you have asked her?\' said Anne, with surprise.\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  I thought it would not be honourable to act otherwise.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s very good of you,\' said Anne, her face warming with a generous\r\nsense of his straightforwardness.  \'But my mother is so entirely ignorant\r\nof a soldier\'s life, and the life of a soldier\'s wife--she is so simple\r\nin all such matters, that I cannot listen to you any more readily for\r\nwhat she may say.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then it is all over for me,\' said the poor trumpet-major, wiping his\r\nface and putting away his handkerchief with an air of finality.\r\n\r\nAnne was silent.  Any woman who has ever tried will know without\r\nexplanation what an unpalatable task it is to dismiss, even when she does\r\nnot love him, a man who has all the natural and moral qualities she would\r\ndesire, and only fails in the social.  Would-be lovers are not so\r\nnumerous, even with the best women, that the sacrifice of one can be felt\r\nas other than a good thing wasted, in a world where there are few good\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\'You are not angry, Miss Garland?\' said he, finding that she did not\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n\'O no.  Don\'t let us say anything more about this now.\'  And she moved\r\non.\r\n\r\nWhen she drew near to the miller and her mother she perceived that they\r\nwere engaged in a conversation of that peculiar kind which is all the\r\nmore full and communicative from the fact of definitive words being few.\r\nIn short, here the game was succeeding which with herself had failed.  It\r\nwas pretty clear from the symptoms, marks, tokens, telegraphs, and\r\ngeneral byplay between widower and widow, that Miller Loveday must have\r\nagain said to Mrs. Garland some such thing as he had said before, with\r\nwhat result this time she did not know.\r\n\r\nAs the situation was delicate, Anne halted awhile apart from them.  The\r\ntrumpet-major, quite ignorant of how his cause was entered into by the\r\nwhite-coated man in the distance (for his father had not yet told him of\r\nhis designs upon Mrs. Garland), did not advance, but stood still by the\r\ngate, as though he were attending a princess, waiting till he should be\r\ncalled up.  Thus they lingered, and the day began to break.  Mrs. Garland\r\nand the miller took no heed of the time, and what it was bringing to\r\nearth and sky, so occupied were they with themselves; but Anne in her\r\nplace and the trumpet-major in his, each in private thought of no bright\r\nkind, watched the gradual glory of the east through all its tones and\r\nchanges.  The world of birds and insects got lively, the blue and the\r\nyellow and the gold of Loveday\'s uniform again became distinct; the sun\r\nbored its way upward, the fields, the trees, and the distant landscape\r\nkindled to flame, and the trumpet-major, backed by a lilac shadow as tall\r\nas a steeple, blazed in the rays like a very god of war.\r\n\r\nIt was half-past three o\'clock.  A short time after, a rattle of horses\r\nand wheels reached their ears from the quarter in which they gazed, and\r\nthere appeared upon the white line of road a moving mass, which presently\r\nascended the hill and drew near.\r\n\r\nThen there arose a huzza from the few knots of watchers gathered there,\r\nand they cried, \'Long live King Jarge!\'  The cortege passed abreast.  It\r\nconsisted of three travelling-carriages, escorted by a detachment of the\r\nGerman Legion.  Anne was told to look in the first carriage--a\r\npost-chariot drawn by four horses--for the King and Queen, and was\r\nrewarded by seeing a profile reminding her of the current coin of the\r\nrealm; but as the party had been travelling all night, and the spectators\r\nhere gathered were few, none of the royal family looked out of the\r\ncarriage windows.  It was said that the two elder princesses were in the\r\nsame carriage, but they remained invisible.  The next vehicle, a coach\r\nand four, contained more princesses, and the third some of their\r\nattendants.\r\n\r\n\'Thank God, I have seen my King!\' said Mrs. Garland, when they had all\r\ngone by.\r\n\r\nNobody else expressed any thankfulness, for most of them had expected a\r\nmore pompous procession than the bucolic tastes of the King cared to\r\nindulge in; and one old man said grimly that that sight of dusty old\r\nleather coaches was not worth waiting for.  Anne looked hither and\r\nthither in the bright rays of the day, each of her eyes having a little\r\nsun in it, which gave her glance a peculiar golden fire, and kindled the\r\nbrown curls grouped over her forehead to a yellow brilliancy, and made\r\nsingle hairs, blown astray by the night, look like lacquered wires.  She\r\nwas wondering if Festus were anywhere near, but she could not see him.\r\n\r\nBefore they left the ridge they turned their attention towards the Royal\r\nwatering-place, which was visible at this place only as a portion of the\r\nsea-shore, from which the night-mist was rolling slowly back.  The sea\r\nbeyond was still wrapped in summer fog, the ships in the roads showing\r\nthrough it as black spiders suspended in the air.  While they looked and\r\nwalked a white jet of smoke burst from a spot which the miller knew to be\r\nthe battery in front of the King\'s residence, and then the report of guns\r\nreached their ears.  This announcement was answered by a salute from the\r\nCastle of the adjoining Isle, and the ships in the neighbouring\r\nanchorage.  All the bells in the town began ringing.  The King and his\r\nfamily had arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.  HOW EVERYBODY GREAT AND SMALL CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF THE DOWNS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the days went on, echoes of the life and bustle of the town reached\r\nthe ears of the quiet people in Overcombe hollow--exciting and moving\r\nthose unimportant natives as a ground-swell moves the weeds in a cave.\r\nTravelling-carriages of all kinds and colours climbed and descended the\r\nroad that led towards the seaside borough.  Some contained those\r\npersonages of the King\'s suite who had not kept pace with him in his\r\njourney from Windsor; others were the coaches of aristocracy, big and\r\nlittle, whom news of the King\'s arrival drew thither for their own\r\npleasure: so that the highway, as seen from the hills about Overcombe,\r\nappeared like an ant-walk--a constant succession of dark spots creeping\r\nalong its surface at nearly uniform rates of progress, and all in one\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThe traffic and intelligence between camp and town passed in a measure\r\nover the villagers\' heads.  It being summer time the miller was much\r\noccupied with business, and the trumpet-major was too constantly engaged\r\nin marching between the camp and Gloucester Lodge with the rest of the\r\ndragoons to bring his friends any news for some days.\r\n\r\nAt last he sent a message that there was to be a review on the downs by\r\nthe King, and that it was fixed for the day following.  This information\r\nsoon spread through the village and country round, and next morning the\r\nwhole population of Overcombe--except two or three very old men and\r\nwomen, a few babies and their nurses, a cripple, and Corporal\r\nTullidge--ascended the slope with the crowds from afar, and awaited the\r\nevents of the day.\r\n\r\nThe miller wore his best coat on this occasion, which meant a good deal.\r\nAn Overcombe man in those days would have a best coat, and keep it as a\r\nbest coat half his life.  The miller\'s had seen five and twenty summers\r\nchiefly through the chinks of a clothes-box, and was not at all shabby as\r\nyet, though getting singular.  But that could not be helped; common coats\r\nand best coats were distinct species, and never interchangeable.  Living\r\nso near the scene of the review he walked up the hill, accompanied by\r\nMrs. Garland and Anne as usual.\r\n\r\nIt was a clear day, with little wind stirring, and the view from the\r\ndowns, one of the most extensive in the county, was unclouded.  The eye\r\nof any observer who cared for such things swept over the wave-washed\r\ntown, and the bay beyond, and the Isle, with its pebble bank, lying on\r\nthe sea to the left of these, like a great crouching animal tethered to\r\nthe mainland.  On the extreme east of the marine horizon, St. Aldhelm\'s\r\nHead closed the scene, the sea to the southward of that point glaring\r\nlike a mirror under the sun.  Inland could be seen Badbury Rings, where a\r\nbeacon had been recently erected; and nearer, Rainbarrow, on Egdon Heath,\r\nwhere another stood: farther to the left Bulbarrow, where there was yet\r\nanother.  Not far from this came Nettlecombe Tout; to the west, Dogberry\r\nHill, and Black\'on near to the foreground, the beacon thereon being built\r\nof furze faggots thatched with straw, and standing on the spot where the\r\nmonument now raises its head.\r\n\r\nAt nine o\'clock the troops marched upon the ground--some from the camps\r\nin the vicinity, and some from quarters in the different towns round\r\nabout.  The approaches to the down were blocked with carriages of all\r\ndescriptions, ages, and colours, and with pedestrians of every class.  At\r\nten the royal personages were said to be drawing near, and soon after the\r\nKing, accompanied by the Dukes of Cambridge and Cumberland, and a couple\r\nof generals, appeared on horseback, wearing a round hat turned up at the\r\nside, with a cockade and military feather.  (Sensation among the crowd.)\r\nThen the Queen and three of the princesses entered the field in a great\r\ncoach drawn by six beautiful cream-coloured horses.  Another coach, with\r\nfour horses of the same sort, brought the two remaining princesses.\r\n(Confused acclamations, \'There\'s King Jarge!\' \'That\'s Queen Sharlett!\'\r\n\'Princess \'Lizabeth!\' \'Princesses Sophiar and Meelyer!\' etc., from the\r\nsurrounding spectators.)\r\n\r\nAnne and her party were fortunate enough to secure a position on the top\r\nof one of the barrows which rose here and there on the down; and the\r\nmiller having gallantly constructed a little cairn of flints, he placed\r\nthe two women thereon, by which means they were enabled to see over the\r\nheads, horses, and coaches of the multitudes below and around.  At the\r\nmarch-past the miller\'s eye, which had been wandering about for the\r\npurpose, discovered his son in his place by the trumpeters, who had moved\r\nforwards in two ranks, and were sounding the march.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s John!\' he cried to the widow.  \'His trumpet-sling is of two\r\ncolours, d\'ye see; and the others be plain.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Garland too saw him now, and enthusiastically admired him from her\r\nhands upwards, and Anne silently did the same.  But before the young\r\nwoman\'s eyes had quite left the trumpet-major they fell upon the figure\r\nof Yeoman Festus riding with his troop, and keeping his face at a medium\r\nbetween haughtiness and mere bravery.  He certainly looked as soldierly\r\nas any of his own corps, and felt more soldierly than half-a-dozen, as\r\nanybody could see by observing him.  Anne got behind the miller, in case\r\nFestus should discover her, and, regardless of his monarch, rush upon her\r\nin a rage with, \'Why the devil did you run away from me that night--hey,\r\nmadam?\'  But she resolved to think no more of him just now, and to stick\r\nto Loveday, who was her mother\'s friend.  In this she was helped by the\r\nstirring tones which burst from the latter gentleman and his subordinates\r\nfrom time to time.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said the miller complacently, \'there\'s few of more consequence in\r\na regiment than a trumpeter.  He\'s the chap that tells \'em what to do,\r\nafter all.  Hey, Mrs. Garland?\'\r\n\r\n\'So he is, miller,\' said she.\r\n\r\n\'They could no more do without Jack and his men than they could without\r\ngenerals.\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed they could not,\' said Mrs. Garland again, in a tone of pleasant\r\nagreement with any one in Great Britain or Ireland.\r\n\r\nIt was said that the line that day was three miles long, reaching from\r\nthe high ground on the right of where the people stood to the turnpike\r\nroad on the left.  After the review came a sham fight, during which\r\naction the crowd dispersed more widely over the downs, enabling Widow\r\nGarland to get still clearer glimpses of the King, and his handsome\r\ncharger, and the head of the Queen, and the elbows and shoulders of the\r\nprincesses in the carriages, and fractional parts of General Garth and\r\nthe Duke of Cumberland; which sights gave her great gratification.  She\r\ntugged at her daughter at every opportunity, exclaiming, \'Now you can see\r\nhis feather!\' \'There\'s her hat!\' \'There\'s her Majesty\'s India muslin\r\nshawl!\' in a minor form of ecstasy, that made the miller think her more\r\ngirlish and animated than her daughter Anne.\r\n\r\nIn those military manoeuvres the miller followed the fortunes of one man;\r\nAnne Garland of two.  The spectators, who, unlike our party, had no\r\npersonal interest in the soldiery, saw only troops and battalions in the\r\nconcrete, straight lines of red, straight lines of blue, white lines\r\nformed of innumerable knee-breeches, black lines formed of many gaiters,\r\ncoming and going in kaleidoscopic change.  Who thought of every point in\r\nthe line as an isolated man, each dwelling all to himself in the\r\nhermitage of his own mind?  One person did, a young man far removed from\r\nthe barrow where the Garlands and Miller Loveday stood.  The natural\r\nexpression of his face was somewhat obscured by the bronzing effects of\r\nrough weather, but the lines of his mouth showed that affectionate\r\nimpulses were strong within him--perhaps stronger than judgment well\r\ncould regulate.  He wore a blue jacket with little brass buttons, and was\r\nplainly a seafaring man.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the part of the plain where rose the tumulus on which the\r\nmiller had established himself, a broad-brimmed tradesman was elbowing\r\nhis way along.  He saw Mr. Loveday from the base of the barrow, and\r\nbeckoned to attract his attention.  Loveday went halfway down, and the\r\nother came up as near as he could.\r\n\r\n\'Miller,\' said the man, \'a letter has been lying at the post-office for\r\nyou for the last three days.  If I had known that I should see ye here\r\nI\'d have brought it along with me.\'\r\n\r\nThe miller thanked him for the news, and they parted, Loveday returning\r\nto the summit.  \'What a very strange thing!\' he said to Mrs. Garland, who\r\nhad looked inquiringly at his face, now very grave.  \'That was Budmouth\r\npostmaster, and he says there\'s a letter for me.  Ah, I now call to mind\r\nthat there _was_ a letter in the candle three days ago this very night--a\r\nlarge red one; but foolish-like I thought nothing o\'t.  Who _can_ that\r\nletter be from?\'\r\n\r\nA letter at this time was such an event for hamleteers, even of the\r\nmiller\'s respectable standing, that Loveday thenceforward was thrown into\r\na fit of abstraction which prevented his seeing any more of the sham\r\nfight, or the people, or the King.  Mrs. Garland imbibed some of his\r\nconcern, and suggested that the letter might come from his son Robert.\r\n\r\n\'I should naturally have thought that,\' said Miller Loveday; \'but he\r\nwrote to me only two months ago, and his brother John heard from him\r\nwithin the last four weeks, when he was just about starting on another\r\nvoyage.  If you\'ll pardon me, Mrs. Garland, ma\'am, I\'ll see if there\'s\r\nany Overcombe man here who is going to Budmouth to-day, so that I may get\r\nthe letter by night-time.  I cannot possibly go myself.\'\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Loveday left them for awhile; and as they were so near home Mrs.\r\nGarland did not wait on the barrow for him to come back, but walked about\r\nwith Anne a little time, until they should be disposed to trot down the\r\nslope to their own door.  They listened to a man who was offering one\r\nguinea to receive ten in case Buonaparte should be killed in three\r\nmonths, and to other entertainments of that nature, which at this time\r\nwere not rare.  Once during their peregrination the eyes of the sailor\r\nbefore-mentioned fell upon Anne; but he glanced over her and passed her\r\nunheedingly by.  Loveday the elder was at this time on the other side of\r\nthe line, looking for a messenger to the town.  At twelve o\'clock the\r\nreview was over, and the King and his family left the hill.  The troops\r\nthen cleared off the field, the spectators followed, and by one o\'clock\r\nthe downs were again bare.\r\n\r\nThey still spread their grassy surface to the sun as on that beautiful\r\nmorning not, historically speaking, so very long ago; but the King and\r\nhis fifteen thousand armed men, the horses, the bands of music, the\r\nprincesses, the cream-coloured teams--the gorgeous centre-piece, in\r\nshort, to which the downs were but the mere mount or margin--how entirely\r\nhave they all passed and gone!--lying scattered about the world as\r\nmilitary and other dust, some at Talavera, Albuera, Salamanca, Vittoria,\r\nToulouse, and Waterloo; some in home churchyards; and a few small\r\nhandfuls in royal vaults.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon John Loveday, lightened of his trumpet and trappings,\r\nappeared at the old mill-house door, and beheld Anne standing at hers.\r\n\r\n\'I saw you, Miss Garland,\' said the soldier gaily.\r\n\r\n\'Where was I?\' said she, smiling.\r\n\r\n\'On the top of the big mound--to the right of the King.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I saw you; lots of times,\' she rejoined.\r\n\r\nLoveday seemed pleased.  \'Did you really take the trouble to find me?\r\nThat was very good of you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Her eyes followed you everywhere,\' said Mrs. Garland from an upper\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\'Of course I looked at the dragoons most,\' said Anne, disconcerted.  \'And\r\nwhen I looked at them my eyes naturally fell upon the trumpets.  I looked\r\nat the dragoons generally, no more.\'\r\n\r\nShe did not mean to show any vexation to the trumpet-major, but he\r\nfancied otherwise, and stood repressed.  The situation was relieved by\r\nthe arrival of the miller, still looking serious.\r\n\r\n\'I am very much concerned, John; I did not go to the review for nothing.\r\nThere\'s a letter a-waiting for me at Budmouth, and I must get it before\r\nbedtime, or I shan\'t sleep a wink.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll go, of course,\' said John; \'and perhaps Miss Garland would like to\r\nsee what\'s doing there to-day?  Everybody is gone or going; the road is\r\nlike a fair.\'\r\n\r\nHe spoke pleadingly, but Anne was not won to assent.\r\n\r\n\'You can drive in the gig; \'twill do Blossom good,\' said the miller.\r\n\r\n\'Let David drive Miss Garland,\' said the trumpet-major, not wishing to\r\ncoerce her; \'I would just as soon walk.\'\r\n\r\nAnne joyfully welcomed this arrangement, and a time was fixed for the\r\nstart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.  THE CONVERSATION IN THE CROWD\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon they drove off, John Loveday being nowhere visible.  All\r\nalong the road they passed and were overtaken by vehicles of all\r\ndescriptions going in the same direction; among them the extraordinary\r\nmachines which had been invented for the conveyance of troops to any\r\npoint of the coast on which the enemy should land; they consisted of four\r\nboards placed across a sort of trolly, thirty men of the volunteer\r\ncompanies riding on each.\r\n\r\nThe popular Georgian watering-place was in a paroxysm of gaiety.  The\r\ntown was quite overpowered by the country round, much to the town\'s\r\ndelight and profit.  The fear of invasion was such that six frigates lay\r\nin the roads to ensure the safety of the royal family, and from the\r\nregiments of horse and foot quartered at the barracks, or encamped on the\r\nhills round about, a picket of a thousand men mounted guard every day in\r\nfront of Gloucester Lodge, where the King resided.  When Anne and her\r\nattendant reached this point, which they did on foot, stabling the horse\r\non the outskirts of the town, it was about six o\'clock.  The King was on\r\nthe Esplanade, and the soldiers were just marching past to mount guard.\r\nThe band formed in front of the King, and all the officers saluted as\r\nthey went by.\r\n\r\nAnne now felt herself close to and looking into the stream of recorded\r\nhistory, within whose banks the littlest things are great, and outside\r\nwhich she and the general bulk of the human race were content to live on\r\nas an unreckoned, unheeded superfluity.\r\n\r\nWhen she turned from her interested gaze at this scene, there stood John\r\nLoveday.  She had had a presentiment that he would turn up in this\r\nmysterious way.  It was marvellous that he could have got there so\r\nquickly; but there he was--not looking at the King, or at the crowd, but\r\nwaiting for the turn of her head.\r\n\r\n\'Trumpet-major, I didn\'t see you,\' said Anne demurely.  \'How is it that\r\nyour regiment is not marching past?\'\r\n\r\n\'We take it by turns, and it is not our turn,\' said Loveday.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to know then if they were afraid that the King would be\r\ncarried off by the First Consul.  Yes, Loveday told her; and his Majesty\r\nwas rather venturesome.  A day or two before he had gone so far to sea\r\nthat he was nearly caught by some of the enemy\'s cruisers.  \'He is\r\nanxious to fight Boney single-handed,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'What a good, brave King!\' said Anne.\r\n\r\nLoveday seemed anxious to come to more personal matters.  \'Will you let\r\nme take you round to the other side, where you can see better?\' he asked.\r\n\'The Queen and the princesses are at the window.\'\r\n\r\nAnne passively assented.  \'David, wait here for me,\' she said; \'I shall\r\nbe back again in a few minutes.\'\r\n\r\nThe trumpet-major then led her off triumphantly, and they skirted the\r\ncrowd and came round on the side towards the sands.  He told her\r\neverything he could think of, military and civil, to which Anne returned\r\npretty syllables and parenthetic words about the colour of the sea and\r\nthe curl of the foam--a way of speaking that moved the soldier\'s heart\r\neven more than long and direct speeches would have done.\r\n\r\n\'And that other thing I asked you?\' he ventured to say at last.\r\n\r\n\'We won\'t speak of it.\'\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t dislike me?\'\r\n\r\n\'O no!\' she said, gazing at the bathing-machines, digging children, and\r\nother common objects of the seashore, as if her interest lay there rather\r\nthan with him.\r\n\r\n\'But I am not worthy of the daughter of a genteel professional man--that\'s\r\nwhat you mean?\'\r\n\r\n\'There\'s something more than worthiness required in such cases, you\r\nknow,\' she said, still without calling her mind away from surrounding\r\nscenes.  \'Ah, there are the Queen and princesses at the window!\'\r\n\r\n\'Something more?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, since you will make me speak, I mean the woman ought to love the\r\nman.\'\r\n\r\nThe trumpet-major seemed to be less concerned about this than about her\r\nsupposed superiority.  \'If it were all right on that point, would you\r\nmind the other?\' he asked, like a man who knows he is too persistent, yet\r\nwho cannot be still.\r\n\r\n\'How can I say, when I don\'t know?  What a pretty chip hat the elder\r\nprincess wears?\'\r\n\r\nHer companion\'s general disappointment extended over him almost to his\r\nlace and his plume.  \'Your mother said, you know, Miss Anne--\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, that\'s the worst of it,\' she said.  \'Let us go back to David; I\r\nhave seen all I want to see, Mr. Loveday.\'\r\n\r\nThe mass of the people had by this time noticed the Queen and princesses\r\nat the window, and raised a cheer, to which the ladies waved their\r\nembroidered handkerchiefs.  Anne went back towards the pavement with her\r\ntrumpet-major, whom all the girls envied her, so fine-looking a soldier\r\nwas he; and not only for that, but because it was well known that he was\r\nnot a soldier from necessity, but from patriotism, his father having\r\nrepeatedly offered to set him up in business: his artistic taste in\r\npreferring a horse and uniform to a dirty, rumbling flour-mill was\r\nadmired by all.  She, too, had a very nice appearance in her best clothes\r\nas she walked along--the sarcenet hat, muslin shawl, and tight-sleeved\r\ngown being of the newest Overcombe fashion, that was only about a year\r\nold in the adjoining town, and in London three or four.  She could not be\r\nharsh to Loveday and dismiss him curtly, for his musical pursuits had\r\nrefined him, educated him, and made him quite poetical.  To-day he had\r\nbeen particularly well-mannered and tender; so, instead of answering,\r\n\'Never speak to me like this again,\' she merely put him off with a \'Let\r\nus go back to David.\'\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the place where they had left him David was gone.\r\n\r\nAnne was now positively vexed.  \'What _shall_ I do?\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s only gone to drink the King\'s health,\' said Loveday, who had\r\nprivately given David the money for performing that operation.  \'Depend\r\nupon it, he\'ll be back soon.\'\r\n\r\n\'Will you go and find him?\' said she, with intense propriety in her looks\r\nand tone.\r\n\r\n\'I will,\' said Loveday reluctantly; and he went.\r\n\r\nAnne stood still.  She could now escape her gallant friend, for, although\r\nthe distance was long, it was not impossible to walk home.  On the other\r\nhand, Loveday was a good and sincere fellow, for whom she had almost a\r\nbrotherly feeling, and she shrank from such a trick.  While she stood and\r\nmused, scarcely heeding the music, the marching of the soldiers, the\r\nKing, the dukes, the brilliant staff, the attendants, and the happy\r\ngroups of people, her eyes fell upon the ground.\r\n\r\nBefore her she saw a flower lying--a crimson sweet-william--fresh and\r\nuninjured.  An instinctive wish to save it from destruction by the\r\npassengers\' feet led her to pick it up; and then, moved by a sudden self-\r\nconsciousness, she looked around.  She was standing before an inn, and\r\nfrom an upper window Festus Derriman was leaning with two or three\r\nkindred spirits of his cut and kind.  He nodded eagerly, and signified to\r\nher that he had thrown the flower.\r\n\r\nWhat should she do?  To throw it away would seem stupid, and to keep it\r\nwas awkward.  She held it between her finger and thumb, twirled it round\r\non its axis and twirled it back again, regarding and yet not examining\r\nit.  Just then she saw the trumpet-major coming back.\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t find David anywhere,\' he said; and his heart was not sorry as he\r\nsaid it.\r\n\r\nAnne was still holding out the sweet-william as if about to drop it, and,\r\nscarcely knowing what she did under the distressing sense that she was\r\nwatched, she offered the flower to Loveday.\r\n\r\nHis face brightened with pleasure as he took it.  \'Thank you, indeed,\' he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThen Anne saw what a misleading blunder she had committed towards Loveday\r\nin playing to the yeoman.  Perhaps she had sown the seeds of a quarrel.\r\n\r\n\'It was not my sweet-william,\' she said hastily; \'it was lying on the\r\nground.  I don\'t mean anything by giving it to you.\'\r\n\r\n\'But I\'ll keep it all the same,\' said the innocent soldier, as if he knew\r\na good deal about womankind; and he put the flower carefully inside his\r\njacket, between his white waistcoat and his heart.\r\n\r\nFestus, seeing this, enlarged himself wrathfully, got hot in the face,\r\nrose to his feet, and glared down upon them like a turnip-lantern.\r\n\r\n\'Let us go away,\' said Anne timorously.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll see you safe to your own door, depend upon me,\' said Loveday.\r\n\'But--I had near forgot--there\'s father\'s letter, that he\'s so anxiously\r\nwaiting for!  Will you come with me to the post-office?  Then I\'ll take\r\nyou straight home.\'\r\n\r\nAnne, expecting Festus to pounce down every minute, was glad to be off\r\nanywhere; so she accepted the suggestion, and they went along the parade\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nLoveday set this down as a proof of Anne\'s relenting.  Thus in joyful\r\nspirits he entered the office, paid the postage, and received the letter.\r\n\r\n\'It is from Bob, after all!\' he said.  \'Father told me to read it at\r\nonce, in case of bad news.  Ask your pardon for keeping you a moment.\'  He\r\nbroke the seal and read, Anne standing silently by.\r\n\r\n\'He is coming home _to be married_,\' said the trumpet-major, without\r\nlooking up.\r\n\r\nAnne did not answer.  The blood swept impetuously up her face at his\r\nwords, and as suddenly went away again, leaving her rather paler than\r\nbefore.  She disguised her agitation and then overcame it, Loveday\r\nobserving nothing of this emotional performance.\r\n\r\n\'As far as I can understand he will be here Saturday,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'Indeed!\' said Anne quite calmly.  \'And who is he going to marry?\'\r\n\r\n\'That I don\'t know,\' said John, turning the letter about.  \'The woman is\r\na stranger.\'\r\n\r\nAt this moment the miller entered the office hastily.\r\n\r\n\'Come, John,\' he cried, \'I have been waiting and waiting for that there\r\nletter till I was nigh crazy!\'\r\n\r\nJohn briefly explained the news, and when his father had recovered from\r\nhis astonishment, taken off his hat, and wiped the exact line where his\r\nforehead joined his hair, he walked with Anne up the street, leaving John\r\nto return alone.  The miller was so absorbed in his mental perspective of\r\nBob\'s marriage, that he saw nothing of the gaieties they passed through;\r\nand Anne seemed also so much impressed by the same intelligence, that she\r\ncrossed before the inn occupied by Festus without showing a recollection\r\nof his presence there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.  LATER IN THE EVENING OF THE SAME DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they reached home the sun was going down.  It had already been\r\nnoised abroad that miller Loveday had received a letter, and, his cart\r\nhaving been heard coming up the lane, the population of Overcombe drew\r\ndown towards the mill as soon as he had gone indoors--a sudden flash of\r\nbrightness from the window showing that he had struck such an early light\r\nas nothing but the immediate deciphering of literature could require.\r\nLetters were matters of public moment, and everybody in the parish had an\r\ninterest in the reading of those rare documents; so that when the miller\r\nhad placed the candle, slanted himself, and called in Mrs. Garland to\r\nhave her opinion on the meaning of any hieroglyphics that he might\r\nencounter in his course, he found that he was to be additionally assisted\r\nby the opinions of the other neighbours, whose persons appeared in the\r\ndoorway, partly covering each other like a hand of cards, yet each\r\nshowing a large enough piece of himself for identification.  To pass the\r\ntime while they were arranging themselves, the miller adopted his usual\r\nway of filling up casual intervals, that of snuffing the candle.\r\n\r\n\'We heard you had got a letter, Maister Loveday,\' they said.\r\n\r\n\'Yes; "Southampton, the twelfth of August, dear father,"\' said Loveday;\r\nand they were as silent as relations at the reading of a will.  Anne, for\r\nwhom the letter had a singular fascination, came in with her mother and\r\nsat down.\r\n\r\nBob stated in his own way that having, since landing, taken into\r\nconsideration his father\'s wish that he should renounce a seafaring life\r\nand become a partner in the mill, he had decided to agree to the\r\nproposal; and with that object in view he would return to Overcombe in\r\nthree days from the time of writing.\r\n\r\nHe then said incidentally that since his voyage he had been in lodgings\r\nat Southampton, and during that time had become acquainted with a lovely\r\nand virtuous young maiden, in whom he found the exact qualities necessary\r\nto his happiness.  Having known this lady for the full space of a\r\nfortnight he had had ample opportunities of studying her character, and,\r\nbeing struck with the recollection that, if there was one thing more than\r\nanother necessary in a mill which had no mistress, it was somebody who\r\ncould play that part with grace and dignity, he had asked Miss Matilda\r\nJohnson to be his wife.  In her kindness she, though sacrificing far\r\nbetter prospects, had agreed; and he could not but regard it as a happy\r\nchance that he should have found at the nick of time such a woman to\r\nadorn his home, whose innocence was as stunning as her beauty.  Without\r\nmuch ado, therefore, he and she had arranged to be married at once, and\r\nat Overcombe, that his father might not be deprived of the pleasures of\r\nthe wedding feast.  She had kindly consented to follow him by land in the\r\ncourse of a few days, and to live in the house as their guest for the\r\nweek or so previous to the ceremony.\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis a proper good letter,\' said Mrs. Comfort from the background.  \'I\r\nnever heerd true love better put out of hand in my life; and they seem\r\n\'nation fond of one another.\'\r\n\r\n\'He haven\'t knowed her such a very long time,\' said Job Mitchell\r\ndubiously.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s nothing,\' said Esther Beach.  \'Nater will find her way, very\r\nrapid when the time\'s come for\'t.  Well, \'tis good news for ye, miller.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sure, I hope \'tis,\' said Loveday, without, however, showing any\r\ngreat hurry to burst into the frantic form of fatherly joy which the\r\nevent should naturally have produced, seeming more disposed to let off\r\nhis feelings by examining thoroughly into the fibres of the letter-paper.\r\n\r\n\'I was five years a-courting my wife,\' he presently remarked.  \'But folks\r\nwere slower about everything in them days.  Well, since she\'s coming we\r\nmust make her welcome.  Did any of ye catch by my reading which day it is\r\nhe means?  What with making out the penmanship, my mind was drawn off\r\nfrom the sense here and there.\'\r\n\r\n\'He says in three days,\' said Mrs. Garland.  \'The date of the letter will\r\nfix it.\'\r\n\r\nOn examination it was found that the day appointed was the one nearly\r\nexpired; at which the miller jumped up and said, \'Then he\'ll be here\r\nbefore bedtime.  I didn\'t gather till now that he was coming afore\r\nSaturday.  Why, he may drop in this very minute!\'\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely spoken when footsteps were heard coming along the front,\r\nand they presently halted at the door.  Loveday pushed through the\r\nneighbours and rushed out; and, seeing in the passage a form which\r\nobscured the declining light, the miller seized hold of him, saying, \'O\r\nmy dear Bob; then you are come!\'\r\n\r\n\'Scrounch it all, miller, don\'t quite pull my poor shoulder out of joint!\r\nWhatever is the matter?\' said the new-comer, trying to release himself\r\nfrom Loveday\'s grasp of affection.  It was Uncle Benjy.\r\n\r\n\'Thought \'twas my son!\' faltered the miller, sinking back upon the toes\r\nof the neighbours who had closely followed him into the entry.  \'Well,\r\ncome in, Mr. Derriman, and make yerself at home.  Why, you haven\'t been\r\nhere for years!  Whatever has made you come now, sir, of all times in the\r\nworld?\'\r\n\r\n\'Is he in there with ye?\' whispered the farmer with misgiving.\r\n\r\n\'Who?\'\r\n\r\n\'My nephew, after that maid that he\'s so mighty smit with?\'\r\n\r\n\'O no; he never calls here.\'\r\n\r\nFarmer Derriman breathed a breath of relief.  \'Well, I\'ve called to tell\r\nye,\' he said, \'that there\'s more news of the French.  We shall have \'em\r\nhere this month as sure as a gun.  The gunboats be all ready--near two\r\nthousand of \'em--and the whole army is at Boulogne.  And, miller, I know\r\nye to be an honest man.\'\r\n\r\nLoveday did not say nay.\r\n\r\n\'Neighbour Loveday, I know ye to be an honest man,\' repeated the old\r\nsquireen.  \'Can I speak to ye alone?\'\r\n\r\nAs the house was full, Loveday took him into the garden, all the while\r\nupon tenter-hooks, not lest Buonaparte should appear in their midst, but\r\nlest Bob should come whilst he was not there to receive him.  When they\r\nhad got into a corner Uncle Benjy said, \'Miller, what with the French,\r\nand what with my nephew Festus, I assure ye my life is nothing but\r\nwherrit from morning to night.  Miller Loveday, you are an honest man.\'\r\n\r\nLoveday nodded.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I\'ve come to ask a favour--to ask if you will take charge of my\r\nfew poor title-deeds and documents and suchlike, while I am away from\r\nhome next week, lest anything should befall me, and they should be stole\r\naway by Boney or Festus, and I should have nothing left in the wide\r\nworld?  I can trust neither banks nor lawyers in these terrible times;\r\nand I am come to you.\'\r\n\r\nLoveday after some hesitation agreed to take care of anything that\r\nDerriman should bring, whereupon the farmer said he would call with the\r\nparchments and papers alluded to in the course of a week.  Derriman then\r\nwent away by the garden gate, mounted his pony, which had been tethered\r\noutside, and rode on till his form was lost in the shades.\r\n\r\nThe miller rejoined his friends, and found that in the meantime John had\r\narrived.  John informed the company that after parting from his father\r\nand Anne he had rambled to the harbour, and discovered the Pewit by the\r\nquay.  On inquiry he had learnt that she came in at eleven o\'clock, and\r\nthat Bob had gone ashore.\r\n\r\n\'We\'ll go and meet him,\' said the miller.  \'\'Tis still light out of\r\ndoors.\'\r\n\r\nSo, as the dew rose from the meads and formed fleeces in the hollows,\r\nLoveday and his friends and neighbours strolled out, and loitered by the\r\nstiles which hampered the footpath from Overcombe to the high road at\r\nintervals of a hundred yards.  John Loveday, being obliged to return to\r\ncamp, was unable to accompany them, but Widow Garland thought proper to\r\nfall in with the procession.  When she had put on her bonnet she called\r\nto her daughter.  Anne said from upstairs that she was coming in a\r\nminute; and her mother walked on without her.\r\n\r\nWhat was Anne doing?  Having hastily unlocked a receptacle for emotional\r\nobjects of small size, she took thence the little folded paper with which\r\nwe have already become acquainted, and, striking a light from her private\r\ntinder-box, she held the paper, and curl of hair it contained, in the\r\ncandle till they were burnt.  Then she put on her hat and followed her\r\nmother and the rest of them across the moist grey fields, cheerfully\r\nsinging in an undertone as she went, to assure herself of her\r\nindifference to circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.  \'CAPTAIN\' BOB LOVEDAY OF THE MERCHANT SERVICE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Loveday and his neighbours were thus rambling forth, full of\r\nexpectancy, some of them, including Anne in the rear, heard the crackling\r\nof light wheels along the curved lane to which the path was the chord.  At\r\nonce Anne thought, \'Perhaps that\'s he, and we are missing him.\'  But\r\nrecent events were not of a kind to induce her to say anything; and the\r\nothers of the company did not reflect on the sound.\r\n\r\nHad they gone across to the hedge which hid the lane, and looked through\r\nit, they would have seen a light cart driven by a boy, beside whom was\r\nseated a seafaring man, apparently of good standing in the merchant\r\nservice, with his feet outside on the shaft.  The vehicle went over the\r\nmain bridge, turned in upon the other bridge at the tail of the mill, and\r\nhalted by the door.  The sailor alighted, showing himself to be a well-\r\nshaped, active, and fine young man, with a bright eye, an anonymous nose,\r\nand of such a rich complexion by exposure to ripening suns that he might\r\nhave been some connexion of the foreigner who calls his likeness the\r\nPortrait of a Gentleman in galleries of the Old Masters.  Yet in spite of\r\nthis, and though Bob Loveday had been all over the world from Cape Horn\r\nto Pekin, and from India\'s coral strand to the White Sea, the most\r\nconspicuous of all the marks that he had brought back with him was an\r\nincreased resemblance to his mother, who had lain all the time beneath\r\nOvercombe church wall.\r\n\r\nCaptain Loveday tried the house door; finding this locked he went to the\r\nmill door: this was locked also, the mill being stopped for the night.\r\n\r\n\'They are not at home,\' he said to the boy.  \'But never mind that.  Just\r\nhelp to unload the things and then I\'ll pay you, and you can drive off\r\nhome.\'\r\n\r\nThe cart was unloaded, and the boy was dismissed, thanking the sailor\r\nprofusely for the payment rendered.  Then Bob Loveday, finding that he\r\nhad still some leisure on his hands, looked musingly east, west, north,\r\nsouth, and nadir; after which he bestirred himself by carrying his goods,\r\narticle by article, round to the back door, out of the way of casual\r\npassers.  This done, he walked round the mill in a more regardful\r\nattitude, and surveyed its familiar features one by one--the panes of the\r\ngrinding-room, now as heretofore clouded with flour as with stale hoar-\r\nfrost; the meal lodged in the corners of the window-sills, forming a soil\r\nin which lichens grew without ever getting any bigger, as they had done\r\nsince his smallest infancy; the mosses on the plinth towards the river,\r\nreaching as high as the capillary power of the walls would fetch up\r\nmoisture for their nourishment, and the penned mill-pond, now as ever on\r\nthe point of overflowing into the garden.  Everything was the same.\r\n\r\nWhen he had had enough of this it occurred to Loveday that he might get\r\ninto the house in spite of the locked doors; and by entering the garden,\r\nplacing a pole from the fork of an apple-tree to the window-sill of a\r\nbedroom on that side, and climbing across like a Barbary ape, he entered\r\nthe window and stepped down inside.  There was something anomalous in\r\nbeing close to the familiar furniture without having first seen his\r\nfather, and its silent, impassive shine was not cheering; it was as if\r\nhis relations were all dead, and only their tables and chests of drawers\r\nleft to greet him.  He went downstairs and seated himself in the dark\r\nparlour.  Finding this place, too, rather solitary, and the tick of the\r\ninvisible clock preternaturally loud, he unearthed the tinder-box,\r\nobtained a light, and set about making the house comfortable for his\r\nfather\'s return, divining that the miller had gone out to meet him by the\r\nwrong road.\r\n\r\nRobert\'s interest in this work increased as he proceeded, and he bustled\r\nround and round the kitchen as lightly as a girl.  David, the indoor\r\nfactotum, having lost himself among the quart pots of Budmouth, there had\r\nbeen nobody left here to prepare supper, and Bob had it all to himself.\r\nIn a short time a fire blazed up the chimney, a tablecloth was found, the\r\nplates were clapped down, and a search made for what provisions the house\r\nafforded, which, in addition to various meats, included some fresh eggs\r\nof the elongated shape that produces cockerels when hatched, and had been\r\nset aside on that account for putting under the next broody hen.\r\n\r\nA more reckless cracking of eggs than that which now went on had never\r\nbeen known in Overcombe since the last large christening; and as Loveday\r\ngashed one on the side, another at the end, another longways, and another\r\ndiagonally, he acquired adroitness by practice, and at last made every\r\nson of a hen of them fall into two hemispheres as neatly as if it opened\r\nby a hinge.  From eggs he proceeded to ham, and from ham to kidneys, the\r\nresult being a brilliant fry.\r\n\r\nNot to be tempted to fall to before his father came back, the returned\r\nnavigator emptied the whole into a dish, laid a plate over the top, his\r\ncoat over the plate, and his hat over his coat.  Thus completely stopping\r\nin the appetizing smell, he sat down to await events.  He was relieved\r\nfrom the tediousness of doing this by hearing voices outside; and in a\r\nminute his father entered.\r\n\r\n\'Glad to welcome ye home, father,\' said Bob.  \'And supper is just ready.\'\r\n\r\n\'Lard, lard--why, Captain Bob\'s here!\' said Mrs. Garland.\r\n\r\n\'And we\'ve been out waiting to meet thee!\' said the miller, as he entered\r\nthe room, followed by representatives of the houses of Cripplestraw,\r\nComfort, Mitchell, Beach, and Snooks, together with some small beginnings\r\nof Fencible Tremlett\'s posterity.  In the rear came David, and quite in\r\nthe vanishing-point of the composition, Anne the fair.\r\n\r\n\'I drove over; and so was forced to come by the road,\' said Bob.\r\n\r\n\'And we went across the fields, thinking you\'d walk,\' said his father.\r\n\r\n\'I should have been here this morning; but not so much as a wheelbarrow\r\ncould I get for my traps; everything was gone to the review.  So I went\r\ntoo, thinking I might meet you there.  I was then obliged to return to\r\nthe harbour for the luggage.\'\r\n\r\nThen there was a welcoming of Captain Bob by pulling out his arms like\r\ndrawers and shutting them again, smacking him on the back as if he were\r\nchoking, holding him at arm\'s length as if he were of too large type to\r\nread close.  All which persecution Bob bore with a wide, genial smile\r\nthat was shaken into fragments and scattered promiscuously among the\r\nspectators.\r\n\r\n\'Get a chair for \'n!\' said the miller to David, whom they had met in the\r\nfields and found to have got nothing worse by his absence than a slight\r\nslant in his walk.\r\n\r\n\'Never mind--I am not tired--I have been here ever so long,\' said Bob.\r\n\'And I--\'  But the chair having been placed behind him, and a smart touch\r\nin the hollow of a person\'s knee by the edge of that piece of furniture\r\nhaving a tendency to make the person sit without further argument, Bob\r\nsank down dumb, and the others drew up other chairs at a convenient\r\nnearness for easy analytic vision and the subtler forms of good\r\nfellowship.  The miller went about saying, \'David, the nine best glasses\r\nfrom the corner cupboard!\'--\'David, the corkscrew!\'--\'David, whisk the\r\ntail of thy smock-frock round the inside of these quart pots afore you\r\ndraw drink in \'em--they be an inch thick in dust!\'--\'David, lower that\r\nchimney-crook a couple of notches that the flame may touch the bottom of\r\nthe kettle, and light three more of the largest candles!\'--\'If you can\'t\r\nget the cork out of the jar, David, bore a hole in the tub of Hollands\r\nthat\'s buried under the scroff in the fuel-house; d\'ye hear?--Dan Brown\r\nleft en there yesterday as a return for the little porker I gied en.\'\r\n\r\nWhen they had all had a thimbleful round, and the superfluous neighbours\r\nhad reluctantly departed, one by one, the inmates gave their minds to the\r\nsupper, which David had begun to serve up.\r\n\r\n\'What be you rolling back the tablecloth for, David?\' said the miller.\r\n\r\n\'Maister Bob have put down one of the under sheets by mistake, and I\r\nthought you might not like it, sir, as there\'s ladies present!\'\r\n\r\n\'Faith, \'twas the first thing that came to hand,\' said Robert.  \'It\r\nseemed a tablecloth to me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Never mind--don\'t pull off the things now he\'s laid \'em down--let it\r\nbide,\' said the miller.  \'But where\'s Widow Garland and Maidy Anne?\'\r\n\r\n\'They were here but a minute ago,\' said David.  \'Depend upon it they have\r\nslinked off \'cause they be shy.\'\r\n\r\nThe miller at once went round to ask them to come back and sup with him;\r\nand while he was gone David told Bob in confidence what an excellent\r\nplace he had for an old man.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, Cap\'n Bob, as I suppose I must call ye; I\'ve worked for yer father\r\nthese eight-and-thirty years, and we have always got on very well\r\ntogether.  Trusts me with all the keys, lends me his sleeve-waistcoat,\r\nand leaves the house entirely to me.  Widow Garland next door, too, is\r\njust the same with me, and treats me as if I was her own child.\'\r\n\r\n\'She must have married young to make you that, David.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes--I\'m years older than she.  \'Tis only my common way of\r\nspeaking.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Garland would not come in to supper, and the meal proceeded without\r\nher, Bob recommending to his father the dish he had cooked, in the manner\r\nof a householder to a stranger just come.  The miller was anxious to know\r\nmore about his son\'s plans for the future, but would not for the present\r\ninterrupt his eating, looking up from his own plate to appreciate Bob\'s\r\ntravelled way of putting English victuals out of sight, as he would have\r\nlooked at a mill on improved principles.\r\n\r\nDavid had only just got the table clear, and set the plates in a row\r\nunder the bakehouse table for the cats to lick, when the door was hastily\r\nopened, and Mrs. Garland came in, looking concerned.\r\n\r\n\'I have been waiting to hear the plates removed to tell you how\r\nfrightened we are at something we hear at the back-door.  It seems like\r\nrobbers muttering; but when I look out there\'s nobody there!\'\r\n\r\n\'This must be seen to,\' said the miller, rising promptly.  \'David, light\r\nthe middle-sized lantern.  I\'ll go and search the garden.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I\'ll go too,\' said his son, taking up a cudgel.  \'Lucky I\'ve come\r\nhome just in time!\'\r\n\r\nThey went out stealthily, followed by the widow and Anne, who had been\r\nafraid to stay alone in the house under the circumstances.  No sooner\r\nwere they beyond the door when, sure enough, there was the muttering\r\nalmost close at hand, and low upon the ground, as from persons lying down\r\nin hiding.\r\n\r\n\'Bless my heart!\' said Bob, striking his head as though it were some\r\nenemy\'s: \'why, \'tis my luggage.  I\'d quite forgot it!\'\r\n\r\n\'What!\' asked his father.\r\n\r\n\'My luggage.  Really, if it hadn\'t been for Mrs. Garland it would have\r\nstayed there all night, and they, poor things! would have been starved.\r\nI\'ve got all sorts of articles for ye.  You go inside, and I\'ll bring \'em\r\nin.  \'Tis parrots that you hear a muttering, Mrs. Garland.  You needn\'t\r\nbe afraid any more.\'\r\n\r\n\'Parrots?\' said the miller.  \'Well, I\'m glad \'tis no worse.  But how\r\ncouldst forget so, Bob?\'\r\n\r\nThe packages were taken in by David and Bob, and the first unfastened\r\nwere three, wrapped in cloths, which being stripped off revealed three\r\ncages, with a gorgeous parrot in each.\r\n\r\n\'This one is for you, father, to hang up outside the door, and amuse us,\'\r\nsaid Bob.  \'He\'ll talk very well, but he\'s sleepy to-night.  This other\r\none I brought along for any neighbour that would like to have him.  His\r\ncolours are not so bright; but \'tis a good bird.  If you would like to\r\nhave him you are welcome to him,\' he said, turning to Anne, who had been\r\ntempted forward by the birds.  \'You have hardly spoken yet, Miss Anne,\r\nbut I recollect you very well.  How much taller you have got, to be\r\nsure!\'\r\n\r\nAnne said she was much obliged, but did not know what she could do with\r\nsuch a present.  Mrs. Garland accepted it for her, and the sailor went\r\non--\'Now this other bird I hardly know what to do with; but I dare say\r\nhe\'ll come in for something or other.\'\r\n\r\n\'He is by far the prettiest,\' said the widow.  \'I would rather have it\r\nthan the other, if you don\'t mind.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Bob, with embarrassment.  \'But the fact is, that bird will\r\nhardly do for ye, ma\'am.  He\'s a hard swearer, to tell the truth; and I\r\nam afraid he\'s too old to be broken of it.\'\r\n\r\n\'How dreadful!\' said Mrs. Garland.\r\n\r\n\'We could keep him in the mill,\' suggested the miller.  \'It won\'t matter\r\nabout the grinder hearing him, for he can\'t learn to cuss worse than he\r\ndo already!\'\r\n\r\n\'The grinder shall have him, then,\' said Bob.  \'The one I have given you,\r\nma\'am, has no harm in him at all.  You might take him to church o\'\r\nSundays as far as that goes.\'\r\n\r\nThe sailor now untied a small wooden box about a foot square, perforated\r\nwith holes.  \'Here are two marmosets,\' he continued.  \'You can\'t see them\r\nto-night; but they are beauties--the tufted sort.\'\r\n\r\n\'What\'s a marmoset?\' said the miller.\r\n\r\n\'O, a little kind of monkey.  They bite strangers rather hard, but you\'ll\r\nsoon get used to \'em.\'\r\n\r\n\'They are wrapped up in something, I declare,\' said Mrs. Garland, peeping\r\nin through a chink.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, that\'s my flannel shirt,\' said Bob apologetically.  \'They suffer\r\nterribly from cold in this climate, poor things! and I had nothing better\r\nto give them.  Well, now, in this next box I\'ve got things of different\r\nsorts.\'\r\n\r\nThe latter was a regular seaman\'s chest, and out of it he produced shells\r\nof many sizes and colours, carved ivories, queer little caskets, gorgeous\r\nfeathers, and several silk handkerchiefs, which articles were spread out\r\nupon all the available tables and chairs till the house began to look\r\nlike a bazaar.\r\n\r\n\'What a lovely shawl!\' exclaimed Widow Garland, in her interest\r\nforestalling the regular exhibition by looking into the box at what was\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\n\'O yes,\' said the mate, pulling out a couple of the most bewitching\r\nshawls that eyes ever saw.  \'One of these I am going to give to that\r\nyoung lady I am shortly to be married to, you know, Mrs. Garland.  Has\r\nfather told you about it?  Matilda Johnson, of Southampton, that\'s her\r\nname.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, we know all about it,\' said the widow.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I shall give one of these shawls to her--because, of course, I\r\nought to.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course,\' said she.\r\n\r\n\'But the other one I\'ve got no use for at all; and,\' he continued,\r\nlooking round, \'will you have it, Miss Anne?  You refused the parrot, and\r\nyou ought not to refuse this.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you,\' said Anne calmly, but much distressed; \'but really I don\'t\r\nwant it, and couldn\'t take it.\'\r\n\r\n\'But do have it!\' said Bob in hurt tones, Mrs. Garland being all the\r\nwhile on tenter-hooks lest Anne should persist in her absurd refusal.\r\n\r\n\'Why, there\'s another reason why you ought to!\' said he, his face\r\nlighting up with recollections.  \'It never came into my head till this\r\nmoment that I used to be your beau in a humble sort of way.  Faith, so I\r\ndid, and we used to meet at places sometimes, didn\'t we--that is, when\r\nyou were not too proud; and once I gave you, or somebody else, a bit of\r\nmy hair in fun.\'\r\n\r\n\'It was somebody else,\' said Anne quickly.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, perhaps it was,\' said Bob innocently.  \'But it was you I used to\r\nmeet, or try to, I am sure.  Well, I\'ve never thought of that boyish time\r\nfor years till this minute!  I am sure you ought to accept some one gift,\r\ndear, out of compliment to those old times!\'\r\n\r\nAnne drew back and shook her head, for she would not trust her voice.\r\n\r\n\'Well, Mrs. Garland, then you shall have it,\' said Bob, tossing the shawl\r\nto that ready receiver.  \'If you don\'t, upon my life I will throw it out\r\nto the first beggar I see.  Now, here\'s a parcel of cap ribbons of the\r\nsplendidest sort I could get.  Have these--do, Anne!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, do,\' said Mrs. Garland.\r\n\r\n\'I promised them to Matilda,\' continued Bob; \'but I am sure she won\'t\r\nwant \'em, as she has got some of her own: and I would as soon see them\r\nupon your head, my dear, as upon hers.\'\r\n\r\n\'I think you had better keep them for your bride if you have promised\r\nthem to her,\' said Mrs. Garland mildly.\r\n\r\n\'It wasn\'t exactly a promise.  I just said, "Til, there\'s some cap\r\nribbons in my box, if you would like to have them."  But she\'s got enough\r\nthings already for any bride in creation.  Anne, now you shall have\r\n\'em--upon my soul you shall--or I\'ll fling them down the mill-tail!\'\r\n\r\nAnne had meant to be perfectly firm in refusing everything, for reasons\r\nobvious even to that poor waif, the meanest capacity; but when it came to\r\nthis point she was absolutely compelled to give in, and reluctantly\r\nreceived the cap ribbons in her arms, blushing fitfully, and with her lip\r\ntrembling in a motion which she tried to exhibit as a smile.\r\n\r\n\'What would Tilly say if she knew!\' said the miller slily.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, indeed--and it is wrong of him!\' Anne instantly cried, tears\r\nrunning down her face as she threw the parcel of ribbons on the floor.\r\n\'You\'d better bestow your gifts where you bestow your l--l--love, Mr.\r\nLoveday--that\'s what I say!\'  And Anne turned her back and went away.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll take them for her,\' said Mrs. Garland, quickly picking up the\r\nparcel.\r\n\r\n\'Now that\'s a pity,\' said Bob, looking regretfully after Anne.  \'I didn\'t\r\nremember that she was a quick-tempered sort of girl at all.  Tell her,\r\nMrs. Garland, that I ask her pardon.  But of course I didn\'t know she was\r\ntoo proud to accept a little present--how should I?  Upon my life if it\r\nwasn\'t for Matilda I\'d--Well, that can\'t be, of course.\'\r\n\r\n\'What\'s this?\' said Mrs. Garland, touching with her foot a large package\r\nthat had been laid down by Bob unseen.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s a bit of baccy for myself,\' said Robert meekly.\r\n\r\nThe examination of presents at last ended, and the two families parted\r\nfor the night.  When they were alone, Mrs. Garland said to Anne, \'What a\r\nclose girl you are!  I am sure I never knew that Bob Loveday and you had\r\nwalked together: you must have been mere children.\'\r\n\r\n\'O yes--so we were,\' said Anne, now quite recovered.  \'It was when we\r\nfirst came here, about a year after father died.  We did not walk\r\ntogether in any regular way.  You know I have never thought the Lovedays\r\nhigh enough for me.  It was only just--nothing at all, and I had almost\r\nforgotten it.\'\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that somebody\'s sins were forgiven her that night\r\nbefore she went to bed.\r\n\r\nWhen Bob and his father were left alone, the miller said, \'Well, Robert,\r\nabout this young woman of thine--Matilda what\'s her name?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, father--Matilda Johnson.  I was just going to tell ye about her.\'\r\n\r\nThe miller nodded, and sipped his mug.\r\n\r\n\'Well, she is an excellent body,\' continued Bob; \'that can truly be\r\nsaid--a real charmer, you know--a nice good comely young woman, a miracle\r\nof genteel breeding, you know, and all that.  She can throw her hair into\r\nthe nicest curls, and she\'s got splendid gowns and headclothes.  In\r\nshort, you might call her a land mermaid.  She\'ll make such a first-rate\r\nwife as there never was.\'\r\n\r\n\'No doubt she will,\' said the miller; \'for I have never known thee\r\nwanting in sense in a jineral way.\'  He turned his cup round on its axis\r\ntill the handle had travelled a complete circle.  \'How long did you say\r\nin your letter that you had known her?\'\r\n\r\n\'A fortnight.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not _very_ long.\'\r\n\r\n\'It don\'t sound long, \'tis true; and \'twas really longer--\'twas fifteen\r\ndays and a quarter.  But hang it, father, I could see in the twinkling of\r\nan eye that the girl would do.  I know a woman well enough when I see\r\nher--I ought to, indeed, having been so much about the world.  Now, for\r\ninstance, there\'s Widow Garland and her daughter.  The girl is a nice\r\nlittle thing; but the old woman--O no!\'  Bob shook his head.\r\n\r\n\'What of her?\' said his father, slightly shifting in his chair.\r\n\r\n\'Well, she\'s, she\'s--I mean, I should never have chose her, you know.\r\nShe\'s of a nice disposition, and young for a widow with a grown-up\r\ndaughter; but if all the men had been like me she would never have had a\r\nhusband.  I like her in some respects; but she\'s a style of beauty I\r\ndon\'t care for.\'\r\n\r\n\'O, if \'tis only looks you are thinking of,\' said the miller, much\r\nrelieved, \'there\'s nothing to be said, of course.  Though there\'s many a\r\nduchess worse-looking, if it comes to argument, as you would find, my\r\nson,\' he added, with a sense of having been mollified too soon.\r\n\r\nThe mate\'s thoughts were elsewhere by this time.\r\n\r\n\'As to my marrying Matilda, thinks I, here\'s one of the very genteelest\r\nsort, and I may as well do the job at once.  So I chose her.  She\'s a\r\ndear girl; there\'s nobody like her, search where you will.\'\r\n\r\n\'How many did you choose her out from?\' inquired his father.\r\n\r\n\'Well, she was the only young woman I happened to know in Southampton,\r\nthat\'s true.  But what of that?  It would have been all the same if I had\r\nknown a hundred.\'\r\n\r\n\'Her father is in business near the docks, I suppose?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, no.  In short, I didn\'t see her father.\'\r\n\r\n\'Her mother?\'\r\n\r\n\'Her mother?  No, I didn\'t.  I think her mother is dead; but she has got\r\na very rich aunt living at Melchester.  I didn\'t see her aunt, because\r\nthere wasn\'t time to go; but of course we shall know her when we are\r\nmarried.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes, of course,\' said the miller, trying to feel quite satisfied.\r\n\'And she will soon be here?\'\r\n\r\n\'Ay, she\'s coming soon,\' said Bob.  \'She has gone to this aunt\'s at\r\nMelchester to get her things packed, and suchlike, or she would have come\r\nwith me.  I am going to meet the coach at the King\'s Arms, Casterbridge,\r\non Sunday, at one o\'clock.  To show what a capital sort of wife she\'ll\r\nbe, I may tell you that she wanted to come by the Mercury, because \'tis a\r\nlittle cheaper than the other.  But I said, "For once in your life do it\r\nwell, and come by the Royal Mail, and I\'ll pay."  I can have the pony and\r\ntrap to fetch her, I suppose, as \'tis too far for her to walk?\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course you can, Bob, or anything else.  And I\'ll do all I can to give\r\nyou a good wedding feast.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.  THEY MAKE READY FOR THE ILLUSTRIOUS STRANGER\r\n\r\n\r\nPreparations for Matilda\'s welcome, and for the event which was to\r\nfollow, at once occupied the attention of the mill.  The miller and his\r\nman had but dim notions of housewifery on any large scale; so the great\r\nwedding cleaning was kindly supervised by Mrs. Garland, Bob being mostly\r\naway during the day with his brother, the trumpet-major, on various\r\nerrands, one of which was to buy paint and varnish for the gig that\r\nMatilda was to be fetched in, which he had determined to decorate with\r\nhis own hands.\r\n\r\nBy the widow\'s direction the old familiar incrustation of shining dirt,\r\nimprinted along the back of the settle by the heads of countless jolly\r\nsitters, was scrubbed and scraped away; the brown circle round the nail\r\nwhereon the miller hung his hat, stained by the brim in wet weather, was\r\nwhitened over; the tawny smudges of bygone shoulders in the passage were\r\nremoved without regard to a certain genial and historical value which\r\nthey had acquired.  The face of the clock, coated with verdigris as thick\r\nas a diachylon plaister, was rubbed till the figures emerged into day;\r\nwhile, inside the case of the same chronometer, the cobwebs that formed\r\ntriangular hammocks, which the pendulum could hardly wade through, were\r\ncleared away at one swoop.\r\n\r\nMrs. Garland also assisted at the invasion of worm-eaten cupboards, where\r\nlayers of ancient smells lingered on in the stagnant air, and recalled to\r\nthe reflective nose the many good things that had been kept there.  The\r\nupper floors were scrubbed with such abundance of water that the\r\nold-established death-watches, wood-lice, and flour-worms were all\r\ndrowned, the suds trickling down into the room below in so lively and\r\nnovel a manner as to convey the romantic notion that the miller lived in\r\na cave with dripping stalactites.\r\n\r\nThey moved what had never been moved before--the oak coffer, containing\r\nthe miller\'s wardrobe--a tremendous weight, what with its locks, hinges,\r\nnails, dirt, framework, and the hard stratification of old jackets,\r\nwaistcoats, and knee-breeches at the bottom, never disturbed since the\r\nmiller\'s wife died, and half pulverized by the moths, whose flattened\r\nskeletons lay amid the mass in thousands.\r\n\r\n\'It fairly makes my back open and shut!\' said Loveday, as, in obedience\r\nto Mrs. Garland\'s direction, he lifted one corner, the grinder and David\r\nassisting at the others.  \'All together: speak when ye be going to heave.\r\nNow!\'\r\n\r\nThe pot covers and skimmers were brought to such a state that, on\r\nexamining them, the beholder was not conscious of utensils, but of his\r\nown face in a condition of hideous elasticity.  The broken clock-line was\r\nmended, the kettles rocked, the creeper nailed up, and a new handle put\r\nto the warming-pan.  The large household lantern was cleaned out, after\r\nthree years of uninterrupted accumulation, the operation yielding a\r\nconglomerate of candle-snuffs, candle-ends, remains of matches,\r\nlamp-black, and eleven ounces and a half of good grease--invaluable as\r\ndubbing for skitty boots and ointment for cart-wheels.\r\n\r\nEverybody said that the mill residence had not been so thoroughly scoured\r\nfor twenty years.  The miller and David looked on with a sort of awe\r\ntempered by gratitude, tacitly admitting by their gaze that this was\r\nbeyond what they had ever thought of.  Mrs. Garland supervised all with\r\ndisinterested benevolence.  It would never have done, she said, for his\r\nfuture daughter-in-law to see the house in its original state.  She would\r\nhave taken a dislike to him, and perhaps to Bob likewise.\r\n\r\n\'Why don\'t ye come and live here with me, and then you would be able to\r\nsee to it at all times?\' said the miller as she bustled about again.  To\r\nwhich she answered that she was considering the matter, and might in good\r\ntime.  He had previously informed her that his plan was to put Bob and\r\nhis wife in the part of the house that she, Mrs. Garland, occupied, as\r\nsoon as she chose to enter his, which relieved her of any fear of being\r\nincommoded by Matilda.\r\n\r\nThe cooking for the wedding festivities was on a proportionate scale of\r\nthoroughness.  They killed the four supernumerary chickens that had just\r\nbegun to crow, and the little curly-tailed barrow pig, in preference to\r\nthe sow; not having been put up fattening for more than five weeks it was\r\nexcellent small meat, and therefore more delicate and likely to suit a\r\ntown-bred lady\'s taste than the large one, which, having reached the\r\nweight of fourteen score, might have been a little gross to a cultured\r\npalate.  There were also provided a cold chine, stuffed veal, and two\r\npigeon pies.  Also thirty rings of black-pot, a dozen of white-pot, and\r\nten knots of tender and well-washed chitterlings, cooked plain in case\r\nshe should like a change.\r\n\r\nAs additional reserves there were sweetbreads, and five milts, sewed up\r\nat one side in the form of a chrysalis, and stuffed with thyme, sage,\r\nparsley, mint, groats, rice, milk, chopped egg, and other ingredients.\r\nThey were afterwards roasted before a slow fire, and eaten hot.\r\n\r\nThe business of chopping so many herbs for the various stuffings was\r\nfound to be aching work for women; and David, the miller, the grinder,\r\nand the grinder\'s boy being fully occupied in their proper branches, and\r\nBob being very busy painting the gig and touching up the harness, Loveday\r\ncalled in a friendly dragoon of John\'s regiment who was passing by, and\r\nhe, being a muscular man, willingly chopped all the afternoon for a quart\r\nof strong, judiciously administered, and all other victuals found, taking\r\noff his jacket and gloves, rolling up his shirt-sleeves and unfastening\r\nhis collar in an honourable and energetic way.\r\n\r\nAll windfalls and maggot-cored codlins were excluded from the apple pies;\r\nand as there was no known dish large enough for the purpose, the puddings\r\nwere stirred up in the milking-pail, and boiled in the three-legged bell-\r\nmetal crock, of great weight and antiquity, which every travelling tinker\r\nfor the previous thirty years had tapped with his stick, coveted, made a\r\nbid for, and often attempted to steal.\r\n\r\nIn the liquor line Loveday laid in an ample barrel of Casterbridge\r\n\'strong beer.\'  This renowned drink--now almost as much a thing of the\r\npast as Falstaff\'s favourite beverage--was not only well calculated to\r\nwin the hearts of soldiers blown dry and dusty by residence in tents on a\r\nhill-top, but of any wayfarer whatever in that land.  It was of the most\r\nbeautiful colour that the eye of an artist in beer could desire; full in\r\nbody, yet brisk as a volcano; piquant, yet without a twang; luminous as\r\nan autumn sunset; free from streakiness of taste; but, finally, rather\r\nheady.  The masses worshipped it, the minor gentry loved it more than\r\nwine, and by the most illustrious county families it was not despised.\r\nAnybody brought up for being drunk and disorderly in the streets of its\r\nnatal borough, had only to prove that he was a stranger to the place and\r\nits liquor to be honourably dismissed by the magistrates, as one\r\novertaken in a fault that no man could guard against who entered the town\r\nunawares.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Mr. Loveday also tapped a hogshead of fine cider that he had\r\nhad mellowing in the house for several months, having bought it of an\r\nhonest down-country man, who did not colour, for any special occasion\r\nlike the present.  It had been pressed from fruit judiciously chosen by\r\nan old hand--Horner and Cleeves apple for the body, a few Tom-Putts for\r\ncolour, and just a dash of Old Five-corners for sparkle--a selection\r\noriginally made to please the palate of a well-known temperate earl who\r\nwas a regular cider-drinker, and lived to be eighty-eight.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the Sunday appointed for her coming Captain Bob Loveday\r\nset out to meet his bride.  He had been all the week engaged in painting\r\nthe gig, assisted by his brother at odd times, and it now appeared of a\r\ngorgeous yellow, with blue streaks, and tassels at the corners, and red\r\nwheels outlined with a darker shade.  He put in the pony at half-past\r\neleven, Anne looking at him from the door as he packed himself into the\r\nvehicle and drove off.  There may be young women who look out at young\r\nmen driving to meet their brides as Anne looked at Captain Bob, and yet\r\nare quite indifferent to the circumstances; but they are not often met\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nSo much dust had been raised on the highway by traffic resulting from the\r\npresence of the Court at the town further on, that brambles hanging from\r\nthe fence, and giving a friendly scratch to the wanderer\'s face, were\r\ndingy as church cobwebs; and the grass on the margin had assumed a paper-\r\nshaving hue.  Bob\'s father had wished him to take David, lest, from want\r\nof recent experience at the whip, he should meet with any mishap; but,\r\npicturing to himself the awkwardness of three in such circumstances, Bob\r\nwould not hear of this; and nothing more serious happened to his driving\r\nthan that the wheel-marks formed two serpentine lines along the road\r\nduring the first mile or two, before he had got his hand in, and that the\r\nhorse shied at a milestone, a piece of paper, a sleeping tramp, and a\r\nwheelbarrow, just to make use of the opportunity of being in bad hands.\r\n\r\nHe entered Casterbridge between twelve and one, and, putting up at the\r\nOld Greyhound, walked on to the Bow.  Here, rather dusty on the ledges of\r\nhis clothes, he stood and waited while the people in their best summer\r\ndresses poured out of the three churches round him.  When they had all\r\ngone, and a smell of cinders and gravy had spread down the ancient high-\r\nstreet, and the pie-dishes from adjacent bakehouses had all travelled\r\npast, he saw the mail coach rise above the arch of Grey\'s Bridge, a\r\nquarter of a mile distant, surmounted by swaying knobs, which proved to\r\nbe the heads of the outside travellers.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s the way for a man\'s bride to come to him,\' said Robert to himself\r\nwith a feeling of poetry; and as the horn sounded and the horses\r\nclattered up the street he walked down to the inn.  The knot of hostlers\r\nand inn-servants had gathered, the horses were dragged from the vehicle,\r\nand the passengers for Casterbridge began to descend.  Captain Bob eyed\r\nthem over, looked inside, looked outside again; to his disappointment\r\nMatilda was not there, nor her boxes, nor anything that was hers.  Neither\r\ncoachman nor guard had seen or heard of such a person at Melchester; and\r\nBob walked slowly away.\r\n\r\nDepressed by forebodings to an extent which took away nearly a third of\r\nhis appetite, he sat down in the parlour of the Old Greyhound to a slice\r\nfrom the family joint of the landlord.  This gentleman, who dined in his\r\nshirt-sleeves, partly because it was August, and partly from a sense that\r\nthey would not be so fit for public view further on in the week,\r\nsuggested that Bob should wait till three or four that afternoon, when\r\nthe road-waggon would arrive, as the lost lady might have preferred that\r\nmode of conveyance; and when Bob appeared rather hurt at the suggestion,\r\nthe landlord\'s wife assured him, as a woman who knew good life, that many\r\ngenteel persons travelled in that way during the present high price of\r\nprovisions.  Loveday, who knew little of travelling by land, readily\r\naccepted her assurance and resolved to wait.\r\n\r\nWandering up and down the pavement, or leaning against some hot wall\r\nbetween the waggon-office and the corner of the street above, he passed\r\nthe time away.  It was a still, sunny, drowsy afternoon, and scarcely a\r\nsoul was visible in the length and breadth of the street.  The office was\r\nnot far from All Saints\' Church, and the church-windows being open, he\r\ncould hear the afternoon service from where he lingered as distinctly as\r\nif he had been one of the congregation.  Thus he was mentally conducted\r\nthrough the Psalms, through the first and second lessons, through the\r\nburst of fiddles and clarionets which announced the evening-hymn, and\r\nwell into the sermon, before any signs of the waggon could be seen upon\r\nthe London road.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon sermons at this church being of a dry and metaphysical\r\nnature at that date, it was by a special providence that the\r\nwaggon-office was placed near the ancient fabric, so that whenever the\r\nSunday waggon was late, which it always was in hot weather, in cold\r\nweather, in wet weather, and in weather of almost every other sort, the\r\nrattle, dismounting, and swearing outside completely drowned the parson\'s\r\nvoice within, and sustained the flagging interest of the congregation at\r\nprecisely the right moment.  No sooner did the charity children begin to\r\nwrithe on their benches, and adult snores grow audible, than the waggon\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nCaptain Loveday felt a kind of sinking in his poetry at the possibility\r\nof her for whom they had made such preparations being in the slow,\r\nunwieldy vehicle which crunched its way towards him; but he would not\r\ngive in to the weakness.  Neither would he walk down the street to meet\r\nthe waggon, lest she should not be there.  At last the broad wheels drew\r\nup against the kerb, the waggoner with his white smock-frock, and whip as\r\nlong as a fishing-line, descended from the pony on which he rode\r\nalongside, and the six broad-chested horses backed from their collars and\r\nshook themselves.  In another moment something showed forth, and he knew\r\nthat Matilda was there.\r\n\r\nBob felt three cheers rise within him as she stepped down; but it being\r\nSunday he did not utter them.  In dress, Miss Johnson passed his\r\nexpectations--a green and white gown, with long, tight sleeves, a green\r\nsilk handkerchief round her neck and crossed in front, a green parasol,\r\nand green gloves.  It was strange enough to see this verdant caterpillar\r\nturn out of a road-waggon, and gracefully shake herself free from the\r\nbits of straw and fluff which would usually gather on the raiment of the\r\ngrandest travellers by that vehicle.\r\n\r\n\'But, my dear Matilda,\' said Bob, when he had kissed her three times with\r\nmuch publicity--the practical step he had determined on seeming to demand\r\nthat these things should no longer be done in a corner--\'my dear Matilda,\r\nwhy didn\'t you come by the coach, having the money for\'t and all?\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s my scrimping!\' said Matilda in a delightful gush.  \'I know you\r\nwon\'t be offended when you know I did it to save against a rainy day!\'\r\n\r\nBob, of course, was not offended, though the glory of meeting her had\r\nbeen less; and even if vexation were possible, it would have been out of\r\nplace to say so.  Still, he would have experienced no little surprise had\r\nhe learnt the real reason of his Matilda\'s change of plan.  That angel\r\nhad, in short, so wildly spent Bob\'s and her own money in the adornment\r\nof her person before setting out, that she found herself without a\r\nsufficient margin for her fare by coach, and had scrimped from sheer\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I have got the trap out at the Greyhound,\' said Bob.  \'I don\'t\r\nknow whether it will hold your luggage and us too; but it looked more\r\nrespectable than the waggon on a Sunday, and if there\'s not room for the\r\nboxes I can walk alongside.\'\r\n\r\n\'I think there will be room,\' said Miss Johnson mildly.  And it was soon\r\nvery evident that she spoke the truth; for when her property was\r\ndeposited on the pavement, it consisted of a trunk about eighteen inches\r\nlong, and nothing more.\r\n\r\n\'O--that\'s all!\' said Captain Loveday, surprised.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s all,\' said the young woman assuringly.  \'I didn\'t want to give\r\ntrouble, you know, and what I have besides I have left at my aunt\'s.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, of course,\' he answered readily.  \'And as it\'s no bigger, I can\r\ncarry it in my hand to the inn, and so it will be no trouble at all.\'\r\n\r\nHe caught up the little box, and they went side by side to the Greyhound;\r\nand in ten minutes they were trotting up the Southern Road.\r\n\r\nBob did not hurry the horse, there being many things to say and hear, for\r\nwhich the present situation was admirably suited.  The sun shone\r\noccasionally into Matilda\'s face as they drove on, its rays picking out\r\nall her features to a great nicety.  Her eyes would have been called\r\nbrown, but they were really eel-colour, like many other nice brown eyes;\r\nthey were well-shaped and rather bright, though they had more of a broad\r\nshine than a sparkle.  She had a firm, sufficient nose, which seemed to\r\nsay of itself that it was good as noses go.  She had rather a picturesque\r\nway of wrapping her upper in her lower lip, so that the red of the latter\r\nshowed strongly.  Whenever she gazed against the sun towards the distant\r\nhills, she brought into her forehead, without knowing it, three short\r\nvertical lines--not there at other times--giving her for the moment\r\nrather a hard look.  And in turning her head round to a far angle, to\r\nstare at something or other that he pointed out, the drawn flesh of her\r\nneck became a mass of lines.  But Bob did not look at these things,\r\nwhich, of course, were of no significance; for had she not told him, when\r\nthey compared ages, that she was a little over two-and-twenty?\r\n\r\nAs Nature was hardly invented at this early point of the century, Bob\'s\r\nMatilda could not say much about the glamour of the hills, or the\r\nshimmering of the foliage, or the wealth of glory in the distant sea, as\r\nshe would doubtless have done had she lived later on; but she did her\r\nbest to be interesting, asking Bob about matters of social interest in\r\nthe neighbourhood, to which she seemed quite a stranger.\r\n\r\n\'Is your watering-place a large city?\' she inquired when they mounted the\r\nhill where the Overcombe folk had waited for the King.\r\n\r\n\'Bless you, my dear--no!  \'Twould be nothing if it wasn\'t for the Royal\r\nFamily, and the lords and ladies, and the regiments of soldiers, and the\r\nfrigates, and the King\'s messengers, and the actors and actresses, and\r\nthe games that go on.\'\r\n\r\nAt the words \'actors and actresses,\' the innocent young thing pricked up\r\nher ears.\r\n\r\n\'Does Elliston pay as good salaries this summer as in--?\'\r\n\r\n\'O, you know about it then?  I thought--\'\r\n\r\n\'O no, no!  I have heard of Budmouth--read in the papers, you know, dear\r\nRobert, about the doings there, and the actors and actresses, you know.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes, I see.  Well, I have been away from England a long time, and\r\ndon\'t know much about the theatre in the town; but I\'ll take you there\r\nsome day.  Would it be a treat to you?\'\r\n\r\n\'O, an amazing treat!\' said Miss Johnson, with an ecstasy in which a\r\nclose observer might have discovered a tinge of ghastliness.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ve never been into one perhaps, dear?\'\r\n\r\n\'N--never,\' said Matilda flatly.  \'Whatever do I see yonder--a row of\r\nwhite things on the down?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, that\'s a part of the encampment above Overcombe.  Lots of soldiers\r\nare encamped about here; those are the white tops of their tents.\'\r\n\r\nHe pointed to a wing of the camp that had become visible.  Matilda was\r\nmuch interested.\r\n\r\n\'It will make it very lively for us,\' he added, \'especially as John is\r\nthere.\'\r\n\r\nShe thought so too, and thus they chatted on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.  TWO FAINTING FITS AND A BEWILDERMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Miller Loveday was expecting the pair with interest; and about\r\nfive o\'clock, after repeated outlooks, he saw two specks the size of\r\ncaraway seeds on the far line of ridge where the sunlit white of the road\r\nmet the blue of the sky.  Then the remainder parts of Bob and his lady\r\nbecame visible, and then the whole vehicle, end on, and he heard the dry\r\nrattle of the wheels on the dusty road.  Miller Loveday\'s plan, as far as\r\nhe had formed any, was that Robert and his wife should live with him in\r\nthe millhouse until Mrs. Garland made up her mind to join him there; in\r\nwhich event her present house would be made over to the young couple.\r\nUpon all grounds, he wished to welcome becomingly the woman of his son\'s\r\nchoice, and came forward promptly as they drew up at the door.\r\n\r\n\'What a lovely place you\'ve got here!\' said Miss Johnson, when the miller\r\nhad received her from the captain.  \'A real stream of water, a real mill-\r\nwheel, and real fowls, and everything!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, \'tis real enough,\' said Loveday, looking at the river with balanced\r\nsentiments; \'and so you will say when you\'ve lived here a bit as mis\'ess,\r\nand had the trouble of claning the furniture.\'\r\n\r\nAt this Miss Johnson looked modest, and continued to do so till Anne, not\r\nknowing they were there, came round the corner of the house, with her\r\nprayer-book in her hand, having just arrived from church.  Bob turned and\r\nsmiled to her, at which Miss Johnson looked glum.  How long she would\r\nhave remained in that phase is unknown, for just then her ears were\r\nassailed by a loud bass note from the other side, causing her to jump\r\nround.\r\n\r\n\'O la! what dreadful thing is it?\' she exclaimed, and beheld a cow of\r\nLoveday\'s, of the name of Crumpler, standing close to her shoulder.  It\r\nbeing about milking-time, she had come to look up David and hasten on the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n\'O, what a horrid bull!--it did frighten me so.  I hope I shan\'t faint,\'\r\nsaid Matilda.\r\n\r\nThe miller immediately used the formula which has been uttered by the\r\nproprietors of live stock ever since Noah\'s time.  \'She won\'t hurt ye.\r\nHoosh, Crumpler!  She\'s as timid as a mouse, ma\'am.\'\r\n\r\nBut as Crumpler persisted in making another terrific inquiry for David,\r\nMatilda could not help closing her eyes and saying, \'O, I shall be gored\r\nto death!\' her head falling back upon Bob\'s shoulder, which--seeing the\r\nurgent circumstances, and knowing her delicate nature--he had\r\nprovidentially placed in a position to catch her.  Anne Garland, who had\r\nbeen standing at the corner of the house, not knowing whether to go back\r\nor come on, at this felt her womanly sympathies aroused.  She ran and\r\ndipped her handkerchief into the splashing mill-tail, and with it damped\r\nMatilda\'s face.  But as her eyes still remained closed, Bob, to increase\r\nthe effect, took the handkerchief from Anne and wrung it out on the\r\nbridge of Matilda\'s nose, whence it ran over the rest of her face in a\r\nstream.\r\n\r\n\'O, Captain Loveday!\' said Anne, \'the water is running over her green\r\nsilk handkerchief, and into her pretty reticule!\'\r\n\r\n\'There--if I didn\'t think so!\' exclaimed Matilda, opening her eyes,\r\nstarting up, and promptly pulling out her own handkerchief, with which\r\nshe wiped away the drops, and an unimportant trifle of her complexion,\r\nassisted by Anne, who, in spite of her background of antagonistic\r\nemotions, could not help being interested.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s right!\' said the miller, his spirits reviving with the revival of\r\nMatilda.  \'The lady is not used to country life; are you, ma\'am?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am not,\' replied the sufferer.  \'All is so strange about here!\'\r\n\r\nSuddenly there spread into the firmament, from the direction of the\r\ndown:--\r\n\r\n   \'Ra, ta, ta!  Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!  Ra, ta, ta!\'\r\n\r\n\'O dear, dear! more hideous country sounds, I suppose?\' she inquired,\r\nwith another start.\r\n\r\n\'O no,\' said the miller cheerfully.  \'\'Tis only my son John\'s trumpeter\r\nchaps at the camp of dragoons just above us, a-blowing Mess, or Feed, or\r\nPicket, or some other of their vagaries.  John will be much pleased to\r\ntell you the meaning on\'t when he comes down.  He\'s trumpet-major, as you\r\nmay know, ma\'am.\'\r\n\r\n\'O yes; you mean Captain Loveday\'s brother.  Dear Bob has mentioned him.\'\r\n\r\n\'If you come round to Widow Garland\'s side of the house, you can see the\r\ncamp,\' said the miller.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t force her; she\'s tired with her long journey,\' said Mrs. Garland\r\nhumanely, the widow having come out in the general wish to see Captain\r\nBob\'s choice.  Indeed, they all behaved towards her as if she were a\r\ntender exotic, which their crude country manners might seriously injure.\r\n\r\nShe went into the house, accompanied by Mrs. Garland and her daughter;\r\nthough before leaving Bob she managed to whisper in his ear, \'Don\'t tell\r\nthem I came by waggon, will you, dear?\'--a request which was quite\r\nneedless, for Bob had long ago determined to keep that a dead secret; not\r\nbecause it was an uncommon mode of travel, but simply that it was hardly\r\nthe usual conveyance for a gorgeous lady to her bridal.\r\n\r\nAs the men had a feeling that they would be superfluous indoors just at\r\npresent, the miller assisted David in taking the horse round to the\r\nstables, Bob following, and leaving Matilda to the women.  Indoors, Miss\r\nJohnson admired everything: the new parrots and marmosets, the black\r\nbeams of the ceiling, the double-corner cupboard with the glass doors,\r\nthrough which gleamed the remainders of sundry china sets acquired by\r\nBob\'s mother in her housekeeping--two-handled sugar-basins, no-handled\r\ntea-cups, a tea-pot like a pagoda, and a cream-jug in the form of a\r\nspotted cow.  This sociability in their visitor was returned by Mrs.\r\nGarland and Anne; and Miss Johnson\'s pleasing habit of partly dying\r\nwhenever she heard any unusual bark or bellow added to her piquancy in\r\ntheir eyes.  But conversation, as such, was naturally at first of a\r\nnervous, tentative kind, in which, as in the works of some minor poets,\r\nthe sense was considerably led by the sound.\r\n\r\n\'You get the sea-breezes here, no doubt?\'\r\n\r\n\'O yes, dear; when the wind is that way.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you like windy weather?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; though not now, for it blows down the young apples.\'\r\n\r\n\'Apples are plentiful, it seems.  You country-folk call St. Swithin\'s\r\ntheir christening day, if it rains?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, dear.  Ah me! I have not been to a christening for these many\r\nyears; the baby\'s name was George, I remember--after the King.\'\r\n\r\n\'I hear that King George is still staying at the town here.  I _hope_\r\nhe\'ll stay till I have seen him!\'\r\n\r\n\'He\'ll wait till the corn turns yellow; he always does.\'\r\n\r\n\'How _very_ fashionable yellow is getting for gloves just now!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  Some persons wear them to the elbow, I hear.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do they?  I was not aware of that.  I struck my elbow last week so hard\r\nagainst the door of my aunt\'s mansion that I feel the ache now.\'\r\n\r\nBefore they were quite overwhelmed by the interest of this discourse, the\r\nmiller and Bob came in.  In truth, Mrs. Garland found the office in which\r\nhe had placed her--that of introducing a strange woman to a house which\r\nwas not the widow\'s own--a rather awkward one, and yet almost a\r\nnecessity.  There was no woman belonging to the house except that\r\nwondrous compendium of usefulness, the intermittent maid-servant, whom\r\nLoveday had, for appearances, borrowed from Mrs. Garland, and Mrs.\r\nGarland was in the habit of borrowing from the girl\'s mother.  And as for\r\nthe demi-woman David, he had been informed as peremptorily as Pharaoh\'s\r\nbaker that the office of housemaid and bedmaker was taken from him, and\r\nwould be given to this girl till the wedding was over, and Bob\'s wife\r\ntook the management into her own hands.\r\n\r\nThey all sat down to high tea, Anne and her mother included, and the\r\ncaptain sitting next to Miss Johnson.  Anne had put a brave face upon the\r\nmatter--outwardly, at least--and seemed in a fair way of subduing any\r\nlingering sentiment which Bob\'s return had revived.  During the evening,\r\nand while they still sat over the meal, John came down on a hurried\r\nvisit, as he had promised, ostensibly on purpose to be introduced to his\r\nintended sister-in-law, but much more to get a word and a smile from his\r\nbeloved Anne.  Before they saw him, they heard the trumpet-major\'s smart\r\nstep coming round the corner of the house, and in a moment his form\r\ndarkened the door.  As it was Sunday, he appeared in his full-dress laced\r\ncoat, white waistcoat and breeches, and towering plume, the latter of\r\nwhich he instantly lowered, as much from necessity as good manners, the\r\nbeam in the mill-house ceiling having a tendency to smash and ruin all\r\nsuch head-gear without warning.\r\n\r\n\'John, we\'ve been hoping you would come down,\' said the miller, \'and so\r\nwe have kept the tay about on purpose.  Draw up, and speak to Mrs.\r\nMatilda Johnson. . . . Ma\'am, this is Robert\'s brother.\'\r\n\r\n\'Your humble servant, ma\'am,\' said the trumpet-major gallantly.\r\n\r\nAs it was getting dusk in the low, small-paned room, he instinctively\r\nmoved towards Miss Johnson as he spoke, who sat with her back to the\r\nwindow.  He had no sooner noticed her features than his helmet nearly\r\nfell from his hand; his face became suddenly fixed, and his natural\r\ncomplexion took itself off, leaving a greenish yellow in its stead.  The\r\nyoung person, on her part, had no sooner looked closely at him than she\r\nsaid weakly, \'Robert\'s brother!\' and changed colour yet more rapidly than\r\nthe soldier had done.  The faintness, previously half counterfeit, seized\r\non her now in real earnest.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t feel well,\' she said, suddenly rising by an effort.  \'This warm\r\nday has quite upset me!\'\r\n\r\nThere was a regular collapse of the tea-party, like that of the Hamlet\r\nplay scene.  Bob seized his sweetheart and carried her upstairs, the\r\nmiller exclaiming, \'Ah, she\'s terribly worn by the journey!  I thought\r\nshe was when I saw her nearly go off at the blare of the cow.  No woman\r\nwould have been frightened at that if she\'d been up to her natural\r\nstrength.\'\r\n\r\n\'That, and being so very shy of men, too, must have made John\'s handsome\r\nregimentals quite overpowering to her, poor thing,\' added Mrs. Garland,\r\nfollowing the catastrophic young lady upstairs, whose indisposition was\r\nthis time beyond question.  And yet, by some perversity of the heart, she\r\nwas as eager now to make light of her faintness as she had been to make\r\nmuch of it two or three hours ago.\r\n\r\nThe miller and John stood like straight sticks in the room the others had\r\nquitted, John\'s face being hastily turned towards a caricature of\r\nBuonaparte on the wall that he had not seen more than a hundred and fifty\r\ntimes before.\r\n\r\n\'Come, sit down and have a dish of tea, anyhow,\' said his father at last.\r\n\'She\'ll soon be right again, no doubt.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thanks; I don\'t want any tea,\' said John quickly.  And, indeed, he did\r\nnot, for he was in one gigantic ache from head to foot.\r\n\r\nThe light had been too dim for anybody to notice his amazement; and not\r\nknowing where to vent it, the trumpet-major said he was going out for a\r\nminute.  He hastened to the bakehouse; but David being there, he went to\r\nthe pantry; but the maid being there, he went to the cart-shed; but a\r\ncouple of tramps being there, he went behind a row of French beans in the\r\ngarden, where he let off an ejaculation the most pious that he had\r\nuttered that Sabbath day: \'Heaven! what\'s to be done!\'\r\n\r\nAnd then he walked wildly about the paths of the dusky garden, where the\r\ntrickling of the brooks seemed loud by comparison with the stillness\r\naround; treading recklessly on the cracking snails that had come forth to\r\nfeed, and entangling his spurs in the long grass till the rowels were\r\nchoked with its blades.  Presently he heard another person approaching,\r\nand his brother\'s shape appeared between the stubbard tree and the hedge.\r\n\r\n\'O, is it you?\' said the mate.\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  I am--taking a little air.\'\r\n\r\n\'She is getting round nicely again; and as I am not wanted indoors just\r\nnow, I am going into the village to call upon a friend or two I have not\r\nbeen able to speak to as yet.\'\r\n\r\nJohn took his brother Bob\'s hand.  Bob rather wondered why.\r\n\r\n\'All right, old boy,\' he said.  \'Going into the village?  You\'ll be back\r\nagain, I suppose, before it gets very late?\'\r\n\r\n\'O yes,\' said Captain Bob cheerfully, and passed out of the garden.\r\n\r\nJohn allowed his eyes to follow his brother till his shape could not be\r\nseen, and then he turned and again walked up and down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.  THE NIGHT AFTER THE ARRIVAL\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn continued his sad and heavy pace till walking seemed too old and\r\nworn-out a way of showing sorrow so new, and he leant himself against the\r\nfork of an apple-tree like a log.  There the trumpet-major remained for a\r\nconsiderable time, his face turned towards the house, whose ancient, many-\r\nchimneyed outline rose against the darkened sky, and just shut out from\r\nhis view the camp above.  But faint noises coming thence from horses\r\nrestless at the pickets, and from visitors taking their leave, recalled\r\nits existence, and reminded him that, in consequence of Matilda\'s\r\narrival, he had obtained leave for the night--a fact which, owing to the\r\nstartling emotions that followed his entry, he had not yet mentioned to\r\nhis friends.\r\n\r\nWhile abstractedly considering how he could best use that privilege under\r\nthe new circumstances which had arisen, he heard Farmer Derriman drive up\r\nto the front door and hold a conversation with his father.  The old man\r\nhad at last apparently brought the tin box of private papers that he\r\nwished the miller to take charge of during Derriman\'s absence; and it\r\nbeing a calm night, John could hear, though he little heeded, Uncle\r\nBenjy\'s reiterated supplications to Loveday to keep it safe from fire and\r\nthieves.  Then Uncle Benjy left, and John\'s father went upstairs to\r\ndeposit the box in a place of security, the whole proceeding reaching\r\nJohn\'s preoccupied comprehension merely as voices during sleep.\r\n\r\nThe next thing was the appearance of a light in the bedroom which had\r\nbeen assigned to Matilda Johnson.  This effectually aroused the trumpet-\r\nmajor, and with a stealthiness unusual in him he went indoors.  No light\r\nwas in the lower rooms, his father, Mrs. Garland, and Anne having gone\r\nout on the bridge to look at the new moon.  John went upstairs on tip-\r\ntoe, and along the uneven passage till he came to her door.  It was\r\nstanding ajar, a band of candlelight shining across the passage and up\r\nthe opposite wall.  As soon as he entered the radiance he saw her.  She\r\nwas standing before the looking-glass, apparently lost in thought, her\r\nfingers being clasped behind her head in abstraction, and the light\r\nfalling full upon her face.\r\n\r\n\'I must speak to you,\' said the trumpet-major.\r\n\r\nShe started, turned and grew paler than before; and then, as if moved by\r\na sudden impulse, she swung the door wide open, and, coming out, said\r\nquite collectedly and with apparent pleasantness, \'O yes; you are my\r\nBob\'s brother!  I didn\'t, for a moment, recognize you.\'\r\n\r\n\'But you do now?\'\r\n\r\n\'As Bob\'s brother.\'\r\n\r\n\'You have not seen me before?\'\r\n\r\n\'I have not,\' she answered, with a face as impassible as Talleyrand\'s.\r\n\r\n\'Good God!\'\r\n\r\n\'I have not!\' she repeated.\r\n\r\n\'Nor any of the --th Dragoons?  Captain Jolly, for instance?\'\r\n\r\n\'No.\'\r\n\r\n\'You mistake.  I\'ll remind you of particulars,\' he said drily.  And he\r\ndid remind her at some length.\r\n\r\n\'Never!\' she said desperately.\r\n\r\nBut she had miscalculated her staying powers, and her adversary\'s\r\ncharacter.  Five minutes after that she was in tears, and the\r\nconversation had resolved itself into words, which, on the soldier\'s\r\npart, were of the nature of commands, tempered by pity, and were a mere\r\nseries of entreaties on hers.\r\n\r\nThe whole scene did not last ten minutes.  When it was over, the trumpet-\r\nmajor walked from the doorway where they had been standing, and brushed\r\nmoisture from his eyes.  Reaching a dark lumber-room, he stood still\r\nthere to calm himself, and then descended by a Flemish-ladder to the\r\nbakehouse, instead of by the front stairs.  He found that the others,\r\nincluding Bob, had gathered in the parlour during his absence and lighted\r\nthe candles.\r\n\r\nMiss Johnson, having sent down some time before John re-entered the house\r\nto say that she would prefer to keep her room that evening, was not\r\nexpected to join them, and on this account Bob showed less than his\r\ncustomary liveliness.  The miller wishing to keep up his son\'s spirits,\r\nexpressed his regret that, it being Sunday night, they could have no\r\nsongs to make the evening cheerful; when Mrs. Garland proposed that they\r\nshould sing psalms which, by choosing lively tunes and not thinking of\r\nthe words, would be almost as good as ballads.\r\n\r\nThis they did, the trumpet-major appearing to join in with the rest; but\r\nas a matter of fact no sound came from his moving lips.  His mind was in\r\nsuch a state that he derived no pleasure even from Anne Garland\'s\r\npresence, though he held a corner of the same book with her, and was\r\ntreated in a winsome way which it was not her usual practice to indulge\r\nin.  She saw that his mind was clouded, and, far from guessing the reason\r\nwhy, was doing her best to clear it.\r\n\r\nAt length the Garlands found that it was the hour for them to leave, and\r\nJohn Loveday at the same time wished his father and Bob good-night, and\r\nwent as far as Mrs. Garland\'s door with her.\r\n\r\nHe had said not a word to show that he was free to remain out of camp,\r\nfor the reason that there was painful work to be done, which it would be\r\nbest to do in secret and alone.  He lingered near the house till its\r\nreflected window-lights ceased to glimmer upon the mill-pond, and all\r\nwithin the dwelling was dark and still.  Then he entered the garden and\r\nwaited there till the back door opened, and a woman\'s figure timorously\r\ncame forward.  John Loveday at once went up to her, and they began to\r\ntalk in low yet dissentient tones.\r\n\r\nThey had conversed about ten minutes, and were parting as if they had\r\ncome to some painful arrangement, Miss Johnson sobbing bitterly, when a\r\nhead stealthily arose above the dense hedgerow, and in a moment a shout\r\nburst from its owner.\r\n\r\n\'Thieves! thieves!--my tin box!--thieves! thieves!\'\r\n\r\nMatilda vanished into the house, and John Loveday hastened to the hedge.\r\n\'For heaven\'s sake, hold your tongue, Mr. Derriman!\' he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\'My tin box!\' said Uncle Benjy.  \'O, only the trumpet-major!\'\r\n\r\n\'Your box is safe enough, I assure you.  It was only\'--here the trumpet-\r\nmajor gave vent to an artificial laugh--\'only a sly bit of courting, you\r\nknow.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ha, ha, I see!\' said the relieved old squireen.  \'Courting Miss Anne!\r\nThen you\'ve ousted my nephew, trumpet-major!  Well, so much the better.\r\nAs for myself, the truth on\'t is that I haven\'t been able to go to bed\r\neasy, for thinking that possibly your father might not take care of what\r\nI put under his charge; and at last I thought I would just step over and\r\nsee if all was safe here before I turned in.  And when I saw your two\r\nshapes my poor nerves magnified ye to housebreakers, and Boneys, and I\r\ndon\'t know what all.\'\r\n\r\n\'You have alarmed the house,\' said the trumpet-major, hearing the\r\nclicking of flint and steel in his father\'s bedroom, followed in a moment\r\nby the rise of a light in the window of the same apartment.  \'You have\r\ngot me into difficulty,\' he added gloomily, as his father opened the\r\ncasement.\r\n\r\n\'I am sorry for that,\' said Uncle Benjy.  \'But step back; I\'ll put it all\r\nright again.\'\r\n\r\n\'What, for heaven\'s sake, is the matter?\' said the miller, his tasselled\r\nnightcap appearing in the opening.\r\n\r\n\'Nothing, nothing!\' said the farmer.  \'I was uneasy about my few bonds\r\nand documents, and I walked this way, miller, before going to bed, as I\r\nstart from home to-morrow morning.  When I came down by your\r\ngarden-hedge, I thought I saw thieves, but it turned out to be--to be--\'\r\n\r\nHere a lump of earth from the trumpet-major\'s hand struck Uncle Benjy in\r\nthe back as a reminder.\r\n\r\n\'To be--the bough of a cherry-tree a-waving in the wind.  Good-night.\'\r\n\r\n\'No thieves are like to try my house,\' said Miller Loveday.  \'Now don\'t\r\nyou come alarming us like this again, farmer, or you shall keep your box\r\nyourself, begging your pardon for saying so.  Good-night t\' ye!\'\r\n\r\n\'Miller, will ye just look, since I am here--just look and see if the box\r\nis all right? there\'s a good man!  I am old, you know, and my poor\r\nremains are not what my original self was.  Look and see if it is where\r\nyou put it, there\'s a good, kind man.\'\r\n\r\n\'Very well,\' said the miller good-humouredly.\r\n\r\n\'Neighbour Loveday! on second thoughts I will take my box home again,\r\nafter all, if you don\'t mind.  You won\'t deem it ill of me?  I have no\r\nsuspicion, of course; but now I think on\'t there\'s rivalry between my\r\nnephew and your son; and if Festus should take it into his head to set\r\nyour house on fire in his enmity, \'twould be bad for my deeds and\r\ndocuments.  No offence, miller, but I\'ll take the box, if you don\'t\r\nmind.\'\r\n\r\n\'Faith! I don\'t mind,\' said Loveday.  \'But your nephew had better think\r\ntwice before he lets his enmity take that colour.\'  Receding from the\r\nwindow, he took the candle to a back part of the room and soon reappeared\r\nwith the tin box.\r\n\r\n\'I won\'t trouble ye to dress,\' said Derriman considerately; \'let en down\r\nby anything you have at hand.\'\r\n\r\nThe box was lowered by a cord, and the old man clasped it in his arms.\r\n\'Thank ye!\' he said with heartfelt gratitude.  \'Good-night!\'\r\n\r\nThe miller replied and closed the window, and the light went out.\r\n\r\n\'There, now I hope you are satisfied, sir?\' said the trumpet-major.\r\n\r\n\'Quite, quite!\' said Derriman; and, leaning on his walking-stick, he\r\npursued his lonely way.\r\n\r\nThat night Anne lay awake in her bed, musing on the traits of the new\r\nfriend who had come to her neighbour\'s house.  She would not be critical,\r\nit was ungenerous and wrong; but she could not help thinking of what\r\ninterested her.  And were there, she silently asked, in Miss Johnson\'s\r\nmind and person such rare qualities as placed that lady altogether beyond\r\ncomparison with herself?  O yes, there must be; for had not Captain Bob\r\nsingled out Matilda from among all other women, herself included?  Of\r\ncourse, with his world-wide experience, he knew best.\r\n\r\nWhen the moon had set, and only the summer stars threw their light into\r\nthe great damp garden, she fancied that she heard voices in that\r\ndirection.  Perhaps they were the voices of Bob and Matilda taking a\r\nlover\'s walk before retiring.  If so, how sleepy they would be next day,\r\nand how absurd it was of Matilda to pretend she was tired!  Ruminating in\r\nthis way, and saying to herself that she hoped they would be happy, Anne\r\nfell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.  MISS JOHNSON\'S BEHAVIOUR CAUSES NO LITTLE SURPRISE\r\n\r\n\r\nPartly from the excitement of having his Matilda under the paternal roof,\r\nBob rose next morning as early as his father and the grinder, and, when\r\nthe big wheel began to patter and the little ones to mumble in response,\r\nwent to sun himself outside the mill-front, among the fowls of brown and\r\nspeckled kinds which haunted that spot, and the ducks that came up from\r\nthe mill-tail.\r\n\r\nStanding on the worn-out mill-stone inlaid in the gravel, he talked with\r\nhis father on various improvements of the premises, and on the proposed\r\narrangements for his permanent residence there, with an enjoyment that\r\nwas half based upon this prospect of the future, and half on the\r\npenetrating warmth of the sun to his back and shoulders.  Then the\r\ndifferent troops of horses began their morning scramble down to the mill-\r\npond, and, after making it very muddy round the edge, ascended the slope\r\nagain.  The bustle of the camp grew more and more audible, and presently\r\nDavid came to say that breakfast was ready.\r\n\r\n\'Is Miss Johnson downstairs?\' said the miller; and Bob listened for the\r\nanswer, looking at a blue sentinel aloft on the down.\r\n\r\n\'Not yet, maister,\' said the excellent David.\r\n\r\n\'We\'ll wait till she\'s down,\' said Loveday.  \'When she is, let us know.\'\r\n\r\nDavid went indoors again, and Loveday and Bob continued their morning\r\nsurvey by ascending into the mysterious quivering recesses of the mill,\r\nand holding a discussion over a second pair of burr-stones, which had to\r\nbe re-dressed before they could be used again.  This and similar things\r\noccupied nearly twenty minutes, and, looking from the window, the elder\r\nof the two was reminded of the time of day by seeing Mrs. Garland\'s table-\r\ncloth fluttering from her back door over the heads of a flock of pigeons\r\nthat had alighted for the crumbs.\r\n\r\n\'I suppose David can\'t find us,\' he said, with a sense of hunger that was\r\nnot altogether strange to Bob.  He put out his head and shouted.\r\n\r\n\'The lady is not down yet,\' said his man in reply.\r\n\r\n\'No hurry, no hurry,\' said the miller, with cheerful emptiness.  \'Bob, to\r\npass the time we\'ll look into the garden.\'\r\n\r\n\'She\'ll get up sooner than this, you know, when she\'s signed articles and\r\ngot a berth here,\' Bob observed apologetically.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes,\' said Loveday; and they descended into the garden.\r\n\r\nHere they turned over sundry flat stones and killed the slugs sheltered\r\nbeneath them from the coming heat of the day, talking of slugs in all\r\ntheir branches--of the brown and the black, of the tough and the tender,\r\nof the reason why there were so many in the garden that year, of the\r\ncoming time when the grass-walks harbouring them were to be taken up and\r\ngravel laid, and of the relatively exterminatory merits of a pair of\r\nscissors and the heel of the shoe.  At last the miller said, \'Well,\r\nreally, Bob, I\'m hungry; we must begin without her.\'\r\n\r\nThey were about to go in, when David appeared with haste in his motions,\r\nhis eyes wider vertically than crosswise, and his cheeks nearly all gone.\r\n\r\n\'Maister, I\'ve been to call her; and as \'a didn\'t speak I rapped, and as\r\n\'a didn\'t answer I kicked, and not being latched the door opened,\r\nand--she\'s gone!\'\r\n\r\nBob went off like a swallow towards the house, and the miller followed\r\nlike the rather heavy man that he was.  That Miss Matilda was not in her\r\nroom, or a scrap of anything belonging to her, was soon apparent.  They\r\nsearched every place in which she could possibly hide or squeeze herself,\r\nevery place in which she could not, but found nothing at all.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bob was quite wild with astonishment and grief.  When he was\r\nquite sure that she was nowhere in his father\'s house, he ran into Mrs.\r\nGarland\'s, and telling them the story so hastily that they hardly\r\nunderstood the particulars, he went on towards Comfort\'s house, intending\r\nto raise the alarm there, and also at Mitchell\'s, Beach\'s,\r\nCripplestraw\'s, the parson\'s, the clerk\'s, the camp of dragoons, of\r\nhussars, and so on through the whole county.  But he paused, and thought\r\nit would be hardly expedient to publish his discomfiture in such a way.\r\nIf Matilda had left the house for any freakish reason he would not care\r\nto look for her, and if her deed had a tragic intent she would keep aloof\r\nfrom camp and village.\r\n\r\nIn his trouble he thought of Anne.  She was a nice girl and could be\r\ntrusted.  To her he went, and found her in a state of excitement and\r\nanxiety which equalled his own.\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis so lonely to cruise for her all by myself!\' said Bob\r\ndisconsolately, his forehead all in wrinkles, \'and I\'ve thought you would\r\ncome with me and cheer the way?\'\r\n\r\n\'Where shall we search?\' said Anne.\r\n\r\n\'O, in the holes of rivers, you know, and down wells, and in quarries,\r\nand over cliffs, and like that.  Your eyes might catch the loom of any\r\nbit of a shawl or bonnet that I should overlook, and it would do me a\r\nreal service.  Please do come!\'\r\n\r\nSo Anne took pity upon him, and put on her hat and went, the miller and\r\nDavid having gone off in another direction.  They examined the ditches of\r\nfields, Bob going round by one fence and Anne by the other, till they met\r\nat the opposite side.  Then they peeped under culverts, into outhouses,\r\nand down old wells and quarries, till the theory of a tragical end had\r\nnearly spent its force in Bob\'s mind, and he began to think that Matilda\r\nhad simply run away.  However, they still walked on, though by this time\r\nthe sun was hot and Anne would gladly have sat down.\r\n\r\n\'Now, didn\'t you think highly of her, Miss Garland?\' he inquired, as the\r\nsearch began to languish.\r\n\r\n\'O yes,\' said Anne, \'very highly.\'\r\n\r\n\'She was really beautiful; no nonsense about her looks, was there?\'\r\n\r\n\'None.  Her beauty was thoroughly ripe--not too young.  We should all\r\nhave got to love her.  What can have possessed her to go away?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know, and, upon my life, I shall soon be drove to say I don\'t\r\ncare!\' replied the mate despairingly.  \'Let me pilot ye down over those\r\nstones,\' he added, as Anne began to descend a rugged quarry.  He stepped\r\nforward, leapt down, and turned to her.\r\n\r\nShe gave him her hand and sprang down.  Before he relinquished his hold,\r\nCaptain Bob raised her fingers to his lips and kissed them.\r\n\r\n\'O, Captain Loveday!\' cried Anne, snatching away her hand in genuine\r\ndismay, while a tear rose unexpectedly to each eye.  \'I never heard of\r\nsuch a thing!  I won\'t go an inch further with you, sir; it is too\r\nbarefaced!\'  And she turned and ran off.\r\n\r\n\'Upon my life I didn\'t mean it!\' said the repentant captain, hastening\r\nafter.  \'I do love her best--indeed I do--and I don\'t love you at all!  I\r\nam not so fickle as that!  I merely just for the moment admired you as a\r\nsweet little craft, and that\'s how I came to do it.  You know, Miss\r\nGarland,\' he continued earnestly, and still running after, \'\'tis like\r\nthis: when you come ashore after having been shut up in a ship for\r\neighteen months, women-folks seem so new and nice that you can\'t help\r\nliking them, one and all in a body; and so your heart is apt to get\r\nscattered and to yaw a bit; but of course I think of poor Matilda most,\r\nand shall always stick to her.\'  He heaved a sigh of tremendous\r\nmagnitude, to show beyond the possibility of doubt that his heart was\r\nstill in the place that honour required.\r\n\r\n\'I am glad to hear that--of course I am very glad!\' said she, with quick\r\npetulance, keeping her face turned from him.  \'And I hope we shall find\r\nher, and that the wedding will not be put off, and that you\'ll both be\r\nhappy.  But I won\'t look for her any more!  No; I don\'t care to look for\r\nher--and my head aches.  I am going home!\'\r\n\r\n\'And so am I,\' said Robert promptly.\r\n\r\n\'No, no; go on looking for her, of course--all the afternoon, and all\r\nnight.  I am sure you will, if you love her.\'\r\n\r\n\'O yes; I mean to.  Still, I ought to convoy you home first?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, you ought not; and I shall not accept your company.  Good-morning,\r\nsir!\'  And she went off over one of the stone stiles with which the spot\r\nabounded, leaving the friendly sailor standing in the field.\r\n\r\nHe sighed again, and, observing the camp not far off, thought he would go\r\nto his brother John and ask him his opinion on the sorrowful case.  On\r\nreaching the tents he found that John was not at liberty just at that\r\ntime, being engaged in practising the trumpeters; and leaving word that\r\nhe wished the trumpet-major to come down to the mill as soon as possible,\r\nBob went back again.\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis no good looking for her,\' he said gloomily.  \'She liked me well\r\nenough, but when she came here and saw the house, and the place, and the\r\nold horse, and the plain furniture, she was disappointed to find us all\r\nso homely, and felt she didn\'t care to marry into such a family!\'\r\n\r\nHis father and David had returned with no news.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, \'tis as I\'ve been thinking, father,\' Bob said.  \'We weren\'t good\r\nenough for her, and she went away in scorn!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, that can\'t be helped,\' said the miller.  \'What we be, we be, and\r\nhave been for generations.  To my mind she seemed glad enough to get hold\r\nof us!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes--for the moment--because of the flowers, and birds, and what\'s\r\npretty in the place,\' said Bob tragically.  \'But you don\'t know,\r\nfather--how should you know, who have hardly been out of Overcombe in\r\nyour life?--you don\'t know what delicate feelings are in a real refined\r\nwoman\'s mind.  Any little vulgar action unreaves their nerves like a\r\nmarline-spike.  Now I wonder if you did anything to disgust her?\'\r\n\r\n\'Faith! not that I know of,\' said Loveday, reflecting.  \'I didn\'t say a\r\nsingle thing that I should naturally have said, on purpose to give no\r\noffence.\'\r\n\r\n\'You was always very homely, you know, father.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; so I was,\' said the miller meekly.\r\n\r\n\'I wonder what it could have been,\' Bob continued, wandering about\r\nrestlessly.  \'You didn\'t go drinking out of the big mug with your mouth\r\nfull, or wipe your lips with your sleeve?\'\r\n\r\n\'That I\'ll swear I didn\'t!\' said the miller firmly.  \'Thinks I, there\'s\r\nno knowing what I may do to shock her, so I\'ll take my solid victuals in\r\nthe bakehouse, and only a crumb and a drop in her company for manners.\'\r\n\r\n\'You could do no more than that, certainly,\' said Bob gently.\r\n\r\n\'If my manners be good enough for well-brought-up people like the\r\nGarlands, they be good enough for her,\' continued the miller, with a\r\nsense of injustice.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s true.  Then it must have been David.  David, come here!  How did\r\nyou behave before that lady?  Now, mind you speak the truth!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, Mr. Captain Robert,\' said David earnestly.  \'I assure ye she was\r\nserved like a royal queen.  The best silver spoons wez put down, and yer\r\npoor grandfer\'s silver tanket, as you seed, and the feather cushion for\r\nher to sit on--\'\r\n\r\n\'Now I\'ve got it!\' said Bob decisively, bringing down his hand upon the\r\nwindow-sill.  \'Her bed was hard!--and there\'s nothing shocks a true lady\r\nlike that.  The bed in that room always was as hard as the Rock of\r\nGibraltar!\'\r\n\r\n\'No, Captain Bob!  The beds were changed--wasn\'t they maister?  We put\r\nthe goose bed in her room, and the flock one, that used to be there, in\r\nyours.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, we did,\' corroborated the miller.  \'David and I changed \'em with\r\nour own hands, because they were too heavy for the women to move.\'\r\n\r\n\'Sure I didn\'t know I had the flock bed,\' murmured Bob.  \'I slept on,\r\nlittle thinking what I was going to wake to.  Well, well, she\'s gone; and\r\nsearch as I will I shall never find another like her!  She was too good\r\nfor me.  She must have carried her box with her own hands, poor girl.  As\r\nfar as that goes, I could overtake her even now, I dare say; but I won\'t\r\nentreat her against her will--not I.\'\r\n\r\nMiller Loveday and David, feeling themselves to be rather a desecration\r\nin the presence of Bob\'s sacred emotions, managed to edge off by degrees,\r\nthe former burying himself in the most floury recesses of the mill, his\r\ninvariable resource when perturbed, the rumbling having a soothing effect\r\nupon the nerves of those properly trained to its music.\r\n\r\nBob was so impatient that, after going up to her room to assure himself\r\nonce more that she had not undressed, but had only lain down on the\r\noutside of the bed, he went out of the house to meet John, and waited on\r\nthe sunny slope of the down till his brother appeared.  John looked so\r\nbrave and shapely and warlike that, even in Bob\'s present distress, he\r\ncould not but feel an honest and affectionate pride at owning such a\r\nrelative.  Yet he fancied that John did not come along with the same\r\nswinging step he had shown yesterday; and when the trumpet-major got\r\nnearer he looked anxiously at the mate and waited for him to speak first.\r\n\r\n\'You know our great trouble, John?\' said Robert, gazing stoically into\r\nhis brother\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n\'Come and sit down, and tell me all about it,\' answered the\r\ntrumpet-major, showing no surprise.\r\n\r\nThey went towards a slight ravine, where it was easier to sit down than\r\non the flat ground, and here John reclined among the grasshoppers,\r\npointing to his brother to do the same.\r\n\r\n\'But do you know what it is?\' said Robert.  \'Has anybody told ye?\'\r\n\r\n\'I do know,\' said John.  \'She\'s gone; and I am thankful!\'\r\n\r\n\'What!\' said Bob, rising to his knees in amazement.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m at the bottom of it,\' said the trumpet-major slowly.\r\n\r\n\'You, John?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; and if you will listen I\'ll tell you all.  Do you remember what\r\nhappened when I came into the room last night?  Why, she turned colour\r\nand nearly fainted away.  That was because she knew me.\'\r\n\r\nBob stared at his brother with a face of pain and distrust.\r\n\r\n\'For once, Bob, I must say something that will hurt thee a good deal,\'\r\ncontinued John.  \'She was not a woman who could possibly be your wife--and\r\nso she\'s gone.\'\r\n\r\n\'You sent her off?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I did.\'\r\n\r\n\'John!--Tell me right through--tell me!\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps I had better,\' said the trumpet-major, his blue eyes resting on\r\nthe far distant sea, that seemed to rise like a wall as high as the hill\r\nthey sat upon.\r\n\r\nAnd then he told a tale of Miss Johnson and the --th Dragoons which wrung\r\nhis heart as much in the telling as it did Bob\'s to hear, and which\r\nshowed that John had been temporarily cruel to be ultimately kind.  Even\r\nBob, excited as he was, could discern from John\'s manner of speaking what\r\na terrible undertaking that night\'s business had been for him.  To\r\njustify the course he had adopted the dictates of duty must have been\r\nimperative; but the trumpet-major, with a becoming reticence which his\r\nbrother at the time was naturally unable to appreciate, scarcely dwelt\r\ndistinctly enough upon the compelling cause of his conduct.  It would,\r\nindeed, have been hard for any man, much less so modest a one as John, to\r\ndo himself justice in that remarkable relation, when the listener was the\r\nlady\'s lover; and it is no wonder that Robert rose to his feet and put a\r\ngreater distance between himself and John.\r\n\r\n\'And what time was it?\' he asked in a hard, suppressed voice.\r\n\r\n\'It was just before one o\'clock.\'\r\n\r\n\'How could you help her to go away?\'\r\n\r\n\'I had a pass.  I carried her box to the coach-office.  She was to follow\r\nat dawn.\'\r\n\r\n\'But she had no money.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, she had; I took particular care of that.\'  John did not add, as he\r\nmight have done, that he had given her, in his pity, all the money he\r\npossessed, and at present had only eighteen-pence in the world.  \'Well,\r\nit is over, Bob; so sit ye down, and talk with me of old times,\' he\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, Jack, it is well enough for you to speak like that,\' said the\r\ndisquieted sailor; \'but I can\'t help feeling that it is a cruel thing you\r\nhave done.  After all, she would have been snug enough for me.  Would I\r\nhad never found out this about her!  John, why did you interfere?  You\r\nhad no right to overhaul my affairs like this.  Why didn\'t you tell me\r\nfairly all you knew, and let me do as I chose?  You have turned her out\r\nof the house, and it\'s a shame!  If she had only come to me!  Why didn\'t\r\nshe?\'\r\n\r\n\'Because she knew it was best to do otherwise.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I shall go after her,\' said Bob firmly.\r\n\r\n\'You can do as you like,\' said John; \'but I would advise you strongly to\r\nleave matters where they are.\'\r\n\r\n\'I won\'t leave matters where they are,\' said Bob impetuously.  \'You have\r\nmade me miserable, and all for nothing.  I tell you she was good enough\r\nfor me; and as long as I knew nothing about what you say of her history,\r\nwhat difference would it have made to me?  Never was there a young woman\r\nwho was better company; and she loved a merry song as I do myself.  Yes,\r\nI\'ll follow her.\'\r\n\r\n\'O, Bob,\' said John; \'I hardly expected this!\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s because you didn\'t know your man.  Can I ask you to do me one\r\nkindness?  I don\'t suppose I can.  Can I ask you not to say a word\r\nagainst her to any of them at home?\'\r\n\r\n\'Certainly.  The very reason why I got her to go off silently, as she has\r\ndone, was because nothing should be said against her here, and no scandal\r\nshould be heard of.\'\r\n\r\n\'That may be; but I\'m off after her.  Marry that girl I will.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll be sorry.\'\r\n\r\n\'That we shall see,\' replied Robert with determination; and he went away\r\nrapidly towards the mill.  The trumpet-major had no heart to follow--no\r\ngood could possibly come of further opposition; and there on the down he\r\nremained like a graven image till Bob had vanished from his sight into\r\nthe mill.\r\n\r\nBob entered his father\'s only to leave word that he was going on a\r\nrenewed search for Matilda, and to pack up a few necessaries for his\r\njourney.  Ten minutes later he came out again with a bundle in his hand,\r\nand John saw him go diagonally across the lower fields towards the high-\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n\'And this is all the good I have done!\' said John, musingly readjusting\r\nhis stock where it cut his neck, and descending towards the mill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.  HOW THEY LESSENED THE EFFECT OF THE CALAMITY\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Anne Garland had gone home, and, being weary with her ramble in\r\nsearch of Matilda, sat silent in a corner of the room.  Her mother was\r\npassing the time in giving utterance to every conceivable surmise on the\r\ncause of Miss Johnson\'s disappearance that the human mind could frame, to\r\nwhich Anne returned monosyllabic answers, the result, not of\r\nindifference, but of intense preoccupation.  Presently Loveday, the\r\nfather, came to the door; her mother vanished with him, and they remained\r\ncloseted together a long time.  Anne went into the garden and seated\r\nherself beneath the branching tree whose boughs had sheltered her during\r\nso many hours of her residence here.  Her attention was fixed more upon\r\nthe miller\'s wing of the irregular building before her than upon that\r\noccupied by her mother, for she could not help expecting every moment to\r\nsee some one run out with a wild face and announce some awful clearing up\r\nof the mystery.\r\n\r\nEvery sound set her on the alert, and hearing the tread of a horse in the\r\nlane she looked round eagerly.  Gazing at her over the hedge was Festus\r\nDerriman, mounted on such an incredibly tall animal that he could see to\r\nher very feet over the thick and broad thorn fence.  She no sooner\r\nrecognized him than she withdrew her glance; but as his eyes were fixed\r\nsteadily upon her this was a futile manoeuvre.\r\n\r\n\'I saw you look round!\' he exclaimed crossly.  \'What have I done to make\r\nyou behave like that?  Come, Miss Garland, be fair.  \'Tis no use to turn\r\nyour back upon me.\'  As she did not turn he went on--\'Well, now, this is\r\nenough to provoke a saint.  Now I tell you what, Miss Garland; here I\'ll\r\nstay till you do turn round, if \'tis all the afternoon.  You know my\r\ntemper--what I say I mean.\'  He seated himself firmly in the saddle,\r\nplucked some leaves from the hedge, and began humming a song, to show how\r\nabsolutely indifferent he was to the flight of time.\r\n\r\n\'What have you come for, that you are so anxious to see me?\' inquired\r\nAnne, when at last he had wearied her patience, rising and facing him\r\nwith the added independence which came from a sense of the hedge between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\'There, I knew you would turn round!\' he said, his hot angry face invaded\r\nby a smile in which his teeth showed like white hemmed in by red at\r\nchess.\r\n\r\n\'What do you want, Mr. Derriman?\' said she.\r\n\r\n\'"What do you want, Mr. Derriman?"--now listen to that!  Is that my\r\nencouragement?\'\r\n\r\nAnne bowed superciliously, and moved away.\r\n\r\n\'I have just heard news that explains all that,\' said the giant, eyeing\r\nher movements with somnolent irascibility.  \'My uncle has been letting\r\nthings out.  He was here late last night, and he saw you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed he didn\'t,\' said Anne.\r\n\r\n\'O, now!  He saw Trumpet-major Loveday courting somebody like you in that\r\ngarden walk; and when he came you ran indoors.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is not true, and I wish to hear no more.\'\r\n\r\n\'Upon my life, he said so!  How can you do it, Miss Garland, when I, who\r\nhave enough money to buy up all the Lovedays, would gladly come to terms\r\nwith ye?  What a simpleton you must be, to pass me over for him!  There,\r\nnow you are angry because I said simpleton!--I didn\'t mean simpleton, I\r\nmeant misguided--misguided rosebud!  That\'s it--run off,\' he continued in\r\na raised voice, as Anne made towards the garden door.  \'But I\'ll have you\r\nyet.  Much reason you have to be too proud to stay with me.  But it won\'t\r\nlast long; I shall marry you, madam, if I choose, as you\'ll see.\'\r\n\r\nWhen he was quite gone, and Anne had calmed down from the not altogether\r\nunrelished fear and excitement that he always caused her, she returned to\r\nher seat under the tree, and began to wonder what Festus Derriman\'s story\r\nmeant, which, from the earnestness of his tone, did not seem like a pure\r\ninvention.  It suddenly flashed upon her mind that she herself had heard\r\nvoices in the garden, and that the persons seen by Farmer Derriman, of\r\nwhose visit and reclamation of his box the miller had told her, might\r\nhave been Matilda and John Loveday.  She further recalled the strange\r\nagitation of Miss Johnson on the preceding evening, and that it occurred\r\njust at the entry of the dragoon, till by degrees suspicion amounted to\r\nconviction that he knew more than any one else supposed of that lady\'s\r\ndisappearance.\r\n\r\nIt was just at this time that the trumpet-major descended to the mill\r\nafter his talk with his brother on the down.  As fate would have it,\r\ninstead of entering the house he turned aside to the garden and walked\r\ndown that pleasant enclosure, to learn if he were likely to find in the\r\nother half of it the woman he loved so well.\r\n\r\nYes, there she was, sitting on the seat of logs that he had repaired for\r\nher, under the apple-tree; but she was not facing in his direction.  He\r\nwalked with a noisier tread, he coughed, he shook a bough, he did\r\neverything, in short, but the one thing that Festus did in the same\r\ncircumstances--call out to her.  He would not have ventured on that for\r\nthe world.  Any of his signs would have been sufficient to attract her a\r\nday or two earlier; now she would not turn.  At last, in his fond\r\nanxiety, he did what he had never done before without an invitation, and\r\ncrossed over into Mrs. Garland\'s half of the garden, till he stood before\r\nher.\r\n\r\nWhen she could not escape him she arose, and, saying \'Good afternoon,\r\ntrumpet-major,\' in a glacial manner unusual with her, walked away to\r\nanother part of the garden.\r\n\r\nLoveday, quite at a loss, had not the strength of mind to persevere\r\nfurther.  He had a vague apprehension that some imperfect knowledge of\r\nthe previous night\'s unhappy business had reached her; and, unable to\r\nremedy the evil without telling more than he dared, he went into the\r\nmill, where his father still was, looking doleful enough, what with his\r\nconcern at events and the extra quantity of flour upon his face through\r\nsticking so closely to business that day.\r\n\r\n\'Well, John; Bob has told you all, of course?  A queer, strange,\r\nperplexing thing, isn\'t it?  I can\'t make it out at all.  There must be\r\nsomething wrong in the woman, or it couldn\'t have happened.  I haven\'t\r\nbeen so upset for years.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nor have I.  I wouldn\'t it should have happened for all I own in the\r\nworld,\' said the dragoon.  \'Have you spoke to Anne Garland to-day--or has\r\nanybody been talking to her?\'\r\n\r\n\'Festus Derriman rode by half-an-hour ago, and talked to her over the\r\nhedge.\'\r\n\r\nJohn guessed the rest, and, after standing on the threshold in silence\r\nawhile, walked away towards the camp.\r\n\r\nAll this time his brother Robert had been hastening along in pursuit of\r\nthe woman who had withdrawn from the scene to avoid the exposure and\r\ncomplete overthrow which would have resulted had she remained.  As the\r\ndistance lengthened between himself and the mill, Bob was conscious of\r\nsome cooling down of the excitement that had prompted him to set out; but\r\nhe did not pause in his walk till he had reached the head of the river\r\nwhich fed the mill-stream.  Here, for some indefinite reason, he allowed\r\nhis eyes to be attracted by the bubbling spring whose waters never failed\r\nor lessened, and he stopped as if to look longer at the scene; it was\r\nreally because his mind was so absorbed by John\'s story.\r\n\r\nThe sun was warm, the spot was a pleasant one, and he deposited his\r\nbundle and sat down.  By degrees, as he reflected, first on John\'s view\r\nand then on his own, his convictions became unsettled; till at length he\r\nwas so balanced between the impulse to go on and the impulse to go back,\r\nthat a puff of wind either way would have been well-nigh sufficient to\r\ndecide for him.  When he allowed John\'s story to repeat itself in his\r\nears, the reasonableness and good sense of his advice seemed beyond\r\nquestion.  When, on the other hand, he thought of his poor Matilda\'s\r\neyes, and her, to him, pleasant ways, their charming arrangements to\r\nmarry, and her probable willingness still, he could hardly bring himself\r\nto do otherwise than follow on the road at the top of his speed.\r\n\r\nThis strife of thought was so well maintained that sitting and standing,\r\nhe remained on the borders of the spring till the shadows had stretched\r\nout eastwards, and the chance of overtaking Matilda had grown\r\nconsiderably less.  Still he did not positively go towards home.  At last\r\nhe took a guinea from his pocket, and resolved to put the question to the\r\nhazard.  \'Heads I go; tails I don\'t.\'  The piece of gold spun in the air\r\nand came down heads.\r\n\r\n\'No, I won\'t go, after all,\' he said.  \'I won\'t be steered by accidents\r\nany more.\'\r\n\r\nHe picked up his bundle and switch, and retraced his steps towards\r\nOvercombe Mill, knocking down the brambles and nettles as he went with\r\ngloomy and indifferent blows.  When he got within sight of the house he\r\nbeheld David in the road.\r\n\r\n\'All right--all right again, captain!\', shouted that retainer.  \'A\r\nwedding after all!  Hurrah!\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah--she\'s back again?\' cried Bob, seizing David, ecstatically, and\r\ndancing round with him.\r\n\r\n\'No--but it\'s all the same! it is of no consequence at all, and no harm\r\nwill be done!  Maister and Mrs. Garland have made up a match, and mean to\r\nmarry at once, that the wedding victuals may not be wasted!  They felt\r\n\'twould be a thousand pities to let such good things get blue-vinnied for\r\nwant of a ceremony to use \'em upon, and at last they have thought of\r\nthis.\'\r\n\r\n\'Victuals--I don\'t care for the victuals!\' bitterly cried Bob, in a tone\r\nof far higher thought.  \'How you disappoint me!\' and he went slowly\r\ntowards the house.\r\n\r\nHis father appeared in the opening of the mill-door, looking more\r\ncheerful than when they had parted.  \'What, Robert, you\'ve been after\r\nher?\' he said.  \'Faith, then, I wouldn\'t have followed her if I had been\r\nas sure as you were that she went away in scorn of us.  Since you told me\r\nthat, I have not looked for her at all.\'\r\n\r\n\'I was wrong, father,\' Bob replied gravely, throwing down his bundle and\r\nstick.  \'Matilda, I find, has not gone away in scorn of us; she has gone\r\naway for other reasons.  I followed her some way; but I have come back\r\nagain.  She may go.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why is she gone?\' said the astonished miller.\r\n\r\nBob had intended, for Matilda\'s sake, to give no reason to a living soul\r\nfor her departure.  But he could not treat his father thus reservedly;\r\nand he told.\r\n\r\n\'She has made great fools of us,\' said the miller deliberately; \'and she\r\nmight have made us greater ones.  Bob, I thought th\' hadst more sense.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, don\'t say anything against her, father,\' implored Bob.  \'\'Twas a\r\nsorry haul, and there\'s an end on\'t.  Let her down quietly, and keep the\r\nsecret.  You promise that?\'\r\n\r\n\'I do.\'  Loveday the elder remained thinking awhile, and then went\r\non--\'Well, what I was going to say is this: I\'ve hit upon a plan to get\r\nout of the awkward corner she has put us in.  What you\'ll think of it I\r\ncan\'t say.\'\r\n\r\n\'David has just given me the heads.\'\r\n\r\n\'And do it hurt your feelings, my son, at such a time?\'\r\n\r\n\'No--I\'ll bring myself to bear it, anyhow!  Why should I object to other\r\npeople\'s happiness because I have lost my own?\' said Bob, with saintly\r\nself-sacrifice in his air.\r\n\r\n\'Well said!\' answered the miller heartily.  \'But you may be sure that\r\nthere will be no unseemly rejoicing, to disturb ye in your present frame\r\nof mind.  All the morning I felt more ashamed than I cared to own at the\r\nthought of how the neighbours, great and small, would laugh at what they\r\nwould call your folly, when they knew what had happened; so I resolved to\r\ntake this step to stave it off, if so be \'twas possible.  And when I saw\r\nMrs. Garland I knew I had done right.  She pitied me so much for having\r\nhad the house cleaned in vain, and laid in provisions to waste, that it\r\nput her into the humour to agree.  We mean to do it right off at once,\r\nafore the pies and cakes get mouldy and the blackpot stale.  \'Twas a good\r\nthought of mine and hers, and I am glad \'tis settled,\' he concluded\r\ncheerfully.\r\n\r\n\'Poor Matilda!\' murmured Bob.\r\n\r\n\'There--I was afraid \'twould hurt thy feelings,\' said the miller, with\r\nself-reproach: \'making preparations for thy wedding, and using them for\r\nmy own!\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said Bob heroically; \'it shall not.  It will be a great comfort in\r\nmy sorrow to feel that the splendid grub, and the ale, and your stunning\r\nnew suit of clothes, and the great table-cloths you\'ve bought, will be\r\njust as useful now as if I had married myself.  Poor Matilda!  But you\r\nwon\'t expect me to join in--you hardly can.  I can sheer off that day\r\nvery easily, you know.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nonsense, Bob!\' said the miller reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\'I couldn\'t stand it--I should break down.\'\r\n\r\n\'Deuce take me if I would have asked her, then, if I had known \'twas\r\ngoing to drive thee out of the house!  Now, come, Bob, I\'ll find a way of\r\narranging it and sobering it down, so that it shall be as melancholy as\r\nyou can require--in short, just like a funeral, if thou\'lt promise to\r\nstay?\'\r\n\r\n\'Very well,\' said the afflicted one.  \'On that condition I\'ll stay.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.  \'UPON THE HILL HE TURNED\'\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving entered into this solemn compact with his son, the elder Loveday\'s\r\nnext action was to go to Mrs. Garland, and ask her how the toning down of\r\nthe wedding had best be done.  \'It is plain enough that to make merry\r\njust now would be slighting Bob\'s feelings, as if we didn\'t care who was\r\nnot married, so long as we were,\' he said.  \'But then, what\'s to be done\r\nabout the victuals?\'\r\n\r\n\'Give a dinner to the poor folk,\' she suggested.  \'We can get everything\r\nused up that way.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s true\' said the miller.  \'There\'s enough of \'em in these times to\r\ncarry off any extras whatsoever.\'\r\n\r\n\'And it will save Bob\'s feelings wonderfully.  And they won\'t know that\r\nthe dinner was got for another sort of wedding and another sort of\r\nguests; so you\'ll have their good-will for nothing.\'\r\n\r\nThe miller smiled at the subtlety of the view.  \'That can hardly be\r\ncalled fair,\' he said.  \'Still, I did mean some of it for them, for the\r\nfriends we meant to ask would not have cleared all.\'\r\n\r\nUpon the whole the idea pleased him well, particularly when he noticed\r\nthe forlorn look of his sailor son as he walked about the place, and\r\npictured the inevitably jarring effect of fiddles and tambourines upon\r\nBob\'s shattered nerves at such a crisis, even if the notes of the former\r\nwere dulled by the application of a mute, and Bob shut up in a distant\r\nbedroom--a plan which had at first occurred to him.  He therefore told\r\nBob that the surcharged larder was to be emptied by the charitable\r\nprocess above alluded to, and hoped he would not mind making himself\r\nuseful in such a good and gloomy work.  Bob readily fell in with the\r\nscheme, and it was at once put in hand and the tables spread.\r\n\r\nThe alacrity with which the substituted wedding was carried out, seemed\r\nto show that the worthy pair of neighbours would have joined themselves\r\ninto one long ago, had there previously occurred any domestic incident\r\ndictating such a step as an apposite expedient, apart from their personal\r\nwish to marry.\r\n\r\nThe appointed morning came, and the service quietly took place at the\r\ncheerful hour of ten, in the face of a triangular congregation, of which\r\nthe base was the front pew, and the apex the west door.  Mrs. Garland\r\ndressed herself in the muslin shawl like Queen Charlotte\'s, that Bob had\r\nbrought home, and her best plum-coloured gown, beneath which peeped out\r\nher shoes with red rosettes.  Anne was present, but she considerately\r\ntoned herself down, so as not to too seriously damage her mother\'s\r\nappearance.  At moments during the ceremony she had a distressing sense\r\nthat she ought not to be born, and was glad to get home again.\r\n\r\nThe interest excited in the village, though real, was hardly enough to\r\nbring a serious blush to the face of coyness.  Neighbours\' minds had\r\nbecome so saturated by the abundance of showy military and regal incident\r\nlately vouchsafed to them, that the wedding of middle-aged civilians was\r\nof small account, excepting in so far that it solved the question whether\r\nor not Mrs. Garland would consider herself too genteel to mate with a\r\ngrinder of corn.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, Loveday\'s heart was made glad by seeing the baked and\r\nboiled in rapid process of consumption by the kitchenful of people\r\nassembled for that purpose.  Three-quarters of an hour were sufficient to\r\nbanish for ever his fears as to spoilt food.  The provisions being the\r\ncause of the assembly, and not its consequence, it had been determined to\r\nget all that would not keep consumed on that day, even if highways and\r\nhedges had to be searched for operators.  And, in addition to the poor\r\nand needy, every cottager\'s daughter known to the miller was invited, and\r\ntold to bring her lover from camp--an expedient which, for letting\r\ndaylight into the inside of full platters, was among the most happy ever\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. and Mrs. Loveday, Anne, and Bob were standing in the parlour,\r\ndiscussing the progress of the entertainment in the next room, John, who\r\nhad not been down all day, entered the house and looked in upon them\r\nthrough the open door.\r\n\r\n\'How\'s this, John?  Why didn\'t you come before?\'\r\n\r\n\'Had to see the captain, and--other duties,\' said the trumpet-major, in a\r\ntone which showed no great zeal for explanations.\r\n\r\n\'Well, come in, however,\' continued the miller, as his son remained with\r\nhis hand on the door-post, surveying them reflectively.\r\n\r\n\'I cannot stay long,\' said John, advancing.  \'The Route is come, and we\r\nare going away.\'\r\n\r\n\'Going away!  Where to?\'\r\n\r\n\'To Exonbury.\'\r\n\r\n\'When?\'\r\n\r\n\'Friday morning.\'\r\n\r\n\'All of you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; some to-morrow and some next day.  The King goes next week.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am sorry for this,\' said the miller, not expressing half his sorrow by\r\nthe simple utterance.  \'I wish you could have been here to-day, since\r\nthis is the case,\' he added, looking at the horizon through the window.\r\n\r\nMrs. Loveday also expressed her regret, which seemed to remind the\r\ntrumpet-major of the event of the day, and he went to her and tried to\r\nsay something befitting the occasion.  Anne had not said that she was\r\neither sorry or glad, but John Loveday fancied that she had looked rather\r\nrelieved than otherwise when she heard his news.  His conversation with\r\nBob on the down made Bob\'s manner, too, remarkably cool, notwithstanding\r\nthat he had after all followed his brother\'s advice, which it was as yet\r\ntoo soon after the event for him to rightly value.  John did not know why\r\nthe sailor had come back, never supposing that it was because he had\r\nthought better of going, and said to him privately, \'You didn\'t overtake\r\nher?\'\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t try to,\' said Bob.\r\n\r\n\'And you are not going to?\'\r\n\r\n\'No; I shall let her drift.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am glad indeed, Bob; you have been wise,\' said John heartily.\r\n\r\nBob, however, still loved Matilda too well to be other than dissatisfied\r\nwith John and the event that he had precipitated, which the elder brother\r\nonly too promptly perceived; and it made his stay that evening of short\r\nduration.  Before leaving he said with some hesitation to his father,\r\nincluding Anne and her mother by his glance, \'Do you think to come up and\r\nsee us off?\'\r\n\r\nThe miller answered for them all, and said that of course they would\r\ncome.  \'But you\'ll step down again between now and then?\' he inquired.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll try to.\'  He added after a pause, \'In case I should not, remember\r\nthat Revalley will sound at half past five; we shall leave about eight.\r\nNext summer, perhaps, we shall come and camp here again.\'\r\n\r\n\'I hope so,\' said his father and Mrs. Loveday.\r\n\r\nThere was something in John\'s manner which indicated to Anne that he\r\nscarcely intended to come down again; but the others did not notice it,\r\nand she said nothing.  He departed a few minutes later, in the dusk of\r\nthe August evening, leaving Anne still in doubt as to the meaning of his\r\nprivate meeting with Miss Johnson.\r\n\r\nJohn Loveday had been going to tell them that on the last night, by an\r\nespecial privilege, it would be in his power to come and stay with them\r\nuntil eleven o\'clock, but at the moment of leaving he abandoned the\r\nintention.  Anne\'s attitude had chilled him, and made him anxious to be\r\noff.  He utilized the spare hours of that last night in another way.\r\n\r\nThis was by coming down from the outskirts of the camp in the evening,\r\nand seating himself near the brink of the mill-pond as soon as it was\r\nquite dark; where he watched the lights in the different windows till one\r\nappeared in Anne\'s bedroom, and she herself came forward to shut the\r\ncasement, with the candle in her hand.  The light shone out upon the\r\nbroad and deep mill-head, illuminating to a distinct individuality every\r\nmoth and gnat that entered the quivering chain of radiance stretching\r\nacross the water towards him, and every bubble or atom of froth that\r\nfloated into its width.  She stood for some time looking out, little\r\nthinking what the darkness concealed on the other side of that wide\r\nstream; till at length she closed the casement, drew the curtains, and\r\nretreated into the room.  Presently the light went out, upon which John\r\nLoveday returned to camp and lay down in his tent.\r\n\r\nThe next morning was dull and windy, and the trumpets of the --th sounded\r\nReveille for the last time on Overcombe Down.  Knowing that the Dragoons\r\nwere going away, Anne had slept heedfully, and was at once awakened by\r\nthe smart notes.  She looked out of the window, to find that the miller\r\nwas already astir, his white form being visible at the end of his garden,\r\nwhere he stood motionless, watching the preparations.  Anne also looked\r\non as well as she could through the dim grey gloom, and soon she saw the\r\nblue smoke from the cooks\' fires creeping fitfully along the ground,\r\ninstead of rising in vertical columns, as it had done during the fine\r\nweather season.  Then the men began to carry their bedding to the\r\nwaggons, and others to throw all refuse into the trenches, till the down\r\nwas lively as an ant-hill.  Anne did not want to see John Loveday again,\r\nbut hearing the household astir, she began to dress at leisure, looking\r\nout at the camp the while.\r\n\r\nWhen the soldiers had breakfasted, she saw them selling and giving away\r\ntheir superfluous crockery to the natives who had clustered round; and\r\nthen they pulled down and cleared away the temporary kitchens which they\r\nhad constructed when they came.  A tapping of tent-pegs and wriggling of\r\npicket-posts followed, and soon the cones of white canvas, now almost\r\nbecome a component part of the landscape, fell to the ground.  At this\r\nmoment the miller came indoors and asked at the foot of the stairs if\r\nanybody was going up the hill with him.\r\n\r\nAnne felt that, in spite of the cloud hanging over John in her mind, it\r\nwould ill become the present moment not to see him off, and she went\r\ndownstairs to her mother, who was already there, though Bob was nowhere\r\nto be seen.  Each took an arm of the miller, and thus climbed to the top\r\nof the hill.  By this time the men and horses were at the place of\r\nassembly, and, shortly after the mill-party reached level ground, the\r\ntroops slowly began to move forward.  When the trumpet-major, half buried\r\nin his uniform, arms, and horse-furniture, drew near to the spot where\r\nthe Lovedays were waiting to see him pass, his father turned anxiously to\r\nAnne and said, \'You will shake hands with John?\'\r\n\r\nAnne faintly replied \'Yes,\' and allowed the miller to take her forward on\r\nhis arm to the trackway, so as to be close to the flank of the\r\napproaching column.  It came up, many people on each side grasping the\r\nhands of the troopers in bidding them farewell; and as soon as John\r\nLoveday saw the members of his father\'s household, he stretched down his\r\nhand across his right pistol for the same performance.  The miller gave\r\nhis, then Mrs. Loveday gave hers, and then the hand of the trumpet-major\r\nwas extended towards Anne.  But as the horse did not absolutely stop, it\r\nwas a somewhat awkward performance for a young woman to undertake, and,\r\nmore on that account than on any other, Anne drew back, and the gallant\r\ntrooper passed by without receiving her adieu.  Anne\'s heart reproached\r\nher for a moment; and then she thought that, after all, he was not going\r\noff to immediate battle, and that she would in all probability see him\r\nagain at no distant date, when she hoped that the mystery of his conduct\r\nwould be explained.  Her thoughts were interrupted by a voice at her\r\nelbow: \'Thank heaven, he\'s gone!  Now there\'s a chance for me.\'\r\n\r\nShe turned, and Festus Derriman was standing by her.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s no chance for you,\' she said indignantly.\r\n\r\n\'Why not?\'\r\n\r\n\'Because there\'s another left!\'\r\n\r\nThe words had slipped out quite unintentionally, and she blushed quickly.\r\nShe would have given anything to be able to recall them; but he had\r\nheard, and said, \'Who?\'\r\n\r\nAnne went forward to the miller to avoid replying, and Festus caught her\r\nno more.\r\n\r\n\'Has anybody been hanging about Overcombe Mill except Loveday\'s son the\r\nsoldier?\' he asked of a comrade.\r\n\r\n\'His son the sailor,\' was the reply.\r\n\r\n\'O--his son the sailor,\' said Festus slowly.  \'Damn his son the sailor!\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.  THE TWO HOUSEHOLDS UNITED\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this particular moment the object of Festus Derriman\'s fulmination was\r\nassuredly not dangerous as a rival.  Bob, after abstractedly watching the\r\nsoldiers from the front of the house till they were out of sight, had\r\ngone within doors and seated himself in the mill-parlour, where his\r\nfather found him, his elbows resting on the table and his forehead on his\r\nhands, his eyes being fixed upon a document that lay open before him.\r\n\r\n\'What art perusing, Bob, with such a long face?\'\r\n\r\nBob sighed, and then Mrs. Loveday and Anne entered.  \'\'Tis only a state-\r\npaper that I fondly thought I should have a use for,\' he said gloomily.\r\nAnd, looking down as before, he cleared his voice, as if moved inwardly\r\nto go on, and began to read in feeling tones from what proved to be his\r\nnullified marriage licence:--\r\n\r\n\'"Timothy Titus Philemon, by permission Bishop of Bristol: To our well-\r\nbeloved Robert Loveday, of the parish of Overcombe, Bachelor; and Matilda\r\nJohnson, of the same parish, Spinster.  Greeting."\'\r\n\r\nHere Anne sighed, but contrived to keep down her sigh to a mere nothing.\r\n\r\n\'Beautiful language, isn\'t it!\' said Bob.  \'I was never greeted like that\r\nafore!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; I have often thought it very excellent language myself,\' said Mrs.\r\nLoveday.\r\n\r\n\'Come to that, the old gentleman will greet thee like it again any day\r\nfor a couple of guineas,\' said the miller.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s not the point, father!  You never could see the real meaning of\r\nthese things. . . .  Well, then he goes on: "Whereas ye are, as it is\r\nalleged, determined to enter into the holy estate of matrimony--"  But\r\nwhy should I read on?  It all means nothing now--nothing, and the\r\nsplendid words are all wasted upon air.  It seems as if I had been hailed\r\nby some venerable hoary prophet, and had turned away, put the helm hard\r\nup, and wouldn\'t hear.\'\r\n\r\nNobody replied, feeling probably that sympathy could not meet the case,\r\nand Bob went on reading the rest of it to himself, occasionally heaving a\r\nbreath like the wind in a ship\'s shrouds.\r\n\r\n\'I wouldn\'t set my mind so much upon her, if I was thee,\' said his father\r\nat last.\r\n\r\n\'Why not?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, folk might call thee a fool, and say thy brains were turning to\r\nwater.\'\r\n\r\nBob was apparently much struck by this thought, and, instead of\r\ncontinuing the discourse further, he carefully folded up the licence,\r\nwent out, and walked up and down the garden.  It was startlingly apt what\r\nhis father had said; and, worse than that, what people would call him\r\nmight be true, and the liquefaction of his brains turn out to be no\r\nfable.  By degrees he became much concerned, and the more he examined\r\nhimself by this new light the more clearly did he perceive that he was in\r\na very bad way.\r\n\r\nOn reflection he remembered that since Miss Johnson\'s departure his\r\nappetite had decreased amazingly.  He had eaten in meat no more than\r\nfourteen or fifteen ounces a day, but one-third of a quartern pudding on\r\nan average, in vegetables only a small heap of potatoes and half a York\r\ncabbage, and no gravy whatever; which, considering the usual appetite of\r\na seaman for fresh food at the end of a long voyage, was no small index\r\nof the depression of his mind.  Then he had waked once every night, and\r\non one occasion twice.  While dressing each morning since the gloomy day\r\nhe had not whistled more than seven bars of a hornpipe without stopping\r\nand falling into thought of a most painful kind; and he had told none but\r\nabsolutely true stories of foreign parts to the neighbouring villagers\r\nwhen they saluted and clustered about him, as usual, for anything he\r\nchose to pour forth--except that story of the whale whose eye was about\r\nas large as the round pond in Derriman\'s ewe-lease--which was like\r\ntempting fate to set a seal for ever upon his tongue as a traveller.  All\r\nthis enervation, mental and physical, had been produced by Matilda\'s\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nHe also considered what he had lost of the rational amusements of manhood\r\nduring these unfortunate days.  He might have gone to the neighbouring\r\nfashionable resort every afternoon, stood before Gloucester Lodge till\r\nthe King and Queen came out, held his hat in his hand, and enjoyed their\r\nMajesties\' smiles at his homage all for nothing--watched the\r\npicket-mounting, heard the different bands strike up, observed the staff;\r\nand, above all, have seen the pretty town girls go trip-trip-trip along\r\nthe esplanade, deliberately fixing their innocent eyes on the distant\r\nsea, the grey cliffs, and the sky, and accidentally on the soldiers and\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll raze out her image,\' he said.  \'She shall make a fool of me no\r\nmore.\'  And his resolve resulted in conduct which had elements of real\r\ngreatness.\r\n\r\nHe went back to his father, whom he found in the mill-loft.  \'\'Tis true,\r\nfather, what you say,\' he observed: \'my brains will turn to bilge-water\r\nif I think of her much longer.  By the oath of a--navigator, I wish I\r\ncould sigh less and laugh more! She\'s gone--why can\'t I let her go, and\r\nbe happy?  But how begin?\'\r\n\r\n\'Take it careless, my son,\' said the miller, \'and lay yourself out to\r\nenjoy snacks and cordials.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah--that\'s a thought!\' said Bob.\r\n\r\n\'Baccy is good for\'t.  So is sperrits.  Though I don\'t advise thee to\r\ndrink neat.\'\r\n\r\n\'Baccy--I\'d almost forgot it!\' said Captain Loveday.\r\n\r\nHe went to his room, hastily untied the package of tobacco that he had\r\nbrought home, and began to make use of it in his own way, calling to\r\nDavid for a bottle of the old household mead that had lain in the cellar\r\nthese eleven years.  He was discovered by his father three-quarters of an\r\nhour later as a half-invisible object behind a cloud of smoke.\r\n\r\nThe miller drew a breath of relief.  \'Why, Bob,\' he said, \'I thought the\r\nhouse was a-fire!\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m smoking rather fast to drown my reflections, father.  \'Tis no use to\r\nchaw.\'\r\n\r\nTo tempt his attenuated appetite the unhappy mate made David cook an\r\nomelet and bake a seed-cake, the latter so richly compounded that it\r\nopened to the knife like a freckled buttercup.  With the same object he\r\nstuck night-lines into the banks of the mill-pond, and drew up next\r\nmorning a family of fat eels, some of which were skinned and prepared for\r\nhis breakfast.  They were his favourite fish, but such had been his\r\ncondition that, until the moment of making this effort, he had quite\r\nforgotten their existence at his father\'s back-door.\r\n\r\nIn a few days Bob Loveday had considerably improved in tone and vigour.\r\nOne other obvious remedy for his dejection was to indulge in the society\r\nof Miss Garland, love being so much more effectually got rid of by\r\ndisplacement than by attempted annihilation.  But Loveday\'s belief that\r\nhe had offended her beyond forgiveness, and his ever-present sense of her\r\nas a woman who by education and antecedents was fitted to adorn a higher\r\nsphere than his own, effectually kept him from going near her for a long\r\ntime, notwithstanding that they were inmates of one house.  The reserve\r\nwas, however, in some degree broken by the appearance one morning, later\r\nin the season, of the point of a saw through the partition which divided\r\nAnne\'s room from the Loveday half of the house.  Though she dined and\r\nsupped with her mother and the Loveday family, Miss Garland had still\r\ncontinued to occupy her old apartments, because she found it more\r\nconvenient there to pursue her hobbies of wool-work and of copying her\r\nfather\'s old pictures.  The division wall had not as yet been broken\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nAs the saw worked its way downwards under her astonished gaze Anne jumped\r\nup from her drawing; and presently the temporary canvasing and papering\r\nwhich had sealed up the old door of communication was cut completely\r\nthrough.  The door burst open, and Bob stood revealed on the other side,\r\nwith the saw in his hand.\r\n\r\n\'I beg your ladyship\'s pardon,\' he said, taking off the hat he had been\r\nworking in, as his handsome face expanded into a smile.  \'I didn\'t know\r\nthis door opened into your private room.\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed, Captain Loveday!\'\r\n\r\n\'I am pulling down the division on principle, as we are now one family.\r\nBut I really thought the door opened into your passage.\'\r\n\r\n\'It don\'t matter; I can get another room.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not at all.  Father wouldn\'t let me turn you out.  I\'ll close it up\r\nagain.\'\r\n\r\nBut Anne was so interested in the novelty of a new doorway that she\r\nwalked through it, and found herself in a dark low passage which she had\r\nnever seen before.\r\n\r\n\'It leads to the mill,\' said Bob.  \'Would you like to go in and see it at\r\nwork?  But perhaps you have already.\'\r\n\r\n\'Only into the ground floor.\'\r\n\r\n\'Come all over it.  I am practising as grinder, you know, to help my\r\nfather.\'\r\n\r\nShe followed him along the dark passage, in the side of which he opened a\r\nlittle trap, when she saw a great slimy cavern, where the long arms of\r\nthe mill-wheel flung themselves slowly and distractedly round, and\r\nsplashing water-drops caught the little light that strayed into the\r\ngloomy place, turning it into stars and flashes.  A cold mist-laden puff\r\nof air came into their faces, and the roar from within made it necessary\r\nfor Anne to shout as she said, \'It is dismal! let us go on.\'\r\n\r\nBob shut the trap, the roar ceased, and they went on to the inner part of\r\nthe mill, where the air was warm and nutty, and pervaded by a fog of\r\nflour.  Then they ascended the stairs, and saw the stones lumbering round\r\nand round, and the yellow corn running down through the hopper.  They\r\nclimbed yet further to the top stage, where the wheat lay in bins, and\r\nwhere long rays like feelers stretched in from the sun through the little\r\nwindow, got nearly lost among cobwebs and timber, and completed their\r\ncourse by marking the opposite wall with a glowing patch of gold.\r\n\r\nIn his earnestness as an exhibitor Bob opened the bolter, which was\r\nspinning rapidly round, the result being that a dense cloud of flour\r\nrolled out in their faces, reminding Anne that her complexion was\r\nprobably much paler by this time than when she had entered the mill.  She\r\nthanked her companion for his trouble, and said she would now go down.  He\r\nfollowed her with the same deference as hitherto, and with a sudden and\r\nincreasing sense that of all cures for his former unhappy passion this\r\nwould have been the nicest, the easiest, and the most effectual, if he\r\nhad only been fortunate enough to keep her upon easy terms.  But Miss\r\nGarland showed no disposition to go further than accept his services as a\r\nguide; she descended to the open air, shook the flour from her like a\r\nbird, and went on into the garden amid the September sunshine, whose rays\r\nlay level across the blue haze which the earth gave forth.  The gnats\r\nwere dancing up and down in airy companies, the nasturtium flowers shone\r\nout in groups from the dark hedge over which they climbed, and the mellow\r\nsmell of the decline of summer was exhaled by everything.  Bob followed\r\nher as far as the gate, looked after her, thought of her as the same girl\r\nwho had half encouraged him years ago, when she seemed so superior to\r\nhim; though now they were almost equal she apparently thought him beneath\r\nher.  It was with a new sense of pleasure that his mind flew to the fact\r\nthat she was now an inmate of his father\'s house.\r\n\r\nHis obsequious bearing was continued during the next week.  In the busy\r\nhours of the day they seldom met, but they regularly encountered each\r\nother at meals, and these cheerful occasions began to have an interest\r\nfor him quite irrespective of dishes and cups.  When Anne entered and\r\ntook her seat she was always loudly hailed by Miller Loveday as he\r\nwhetted his knife; but from Bob she condescended to accept no such\r\nfamiliar greeting, and they often sat down together as if each had a\r\nblind eye in the direction of the other.  Bob sometimes told serious and\r\ncorrect stories about sea-captains, pilots, boatswains, mates, able\r\nseamen, and other curious fauna of the marine world; but these were\r\ndirectly addressed to his father and Mrs. Loveday, Anne being included at\r\nthe clinching-point by a glance only.  He sometimes opened bottles of\r\nsweet cider for her, and then she thanked him; but even this did not lead\r\nto her encouraging his chat.\r\n\r\nOne day when Anne was paring an apple she was left at table with the\r\nyoung man.  \'I have made something for you,\' he said.\r\n\r\nShe looked all over the table; nothing was there save the ordinary\r\nremnants.\r\n\r\n\'O I don\'t mean that it is here; it is out by the bridge at the\r\nmill-head.\'\r\n\r\nHe arose, and Anne followed with curiosity in her eyes, and with her firm\r\nlittle mouth pouted up to a puzzled shape.  On reaching the mossy mill-\r\nhead she found that he had fixed in the keen damp draught which always\r\nprevailed over the wheel an AEolian harp of large size.  At present the\r\nstrings were partly covered with a cloth.  He lifted it, and the wires\r\nbegan to emit a weird harmony which mingled curiously with the plashing\r\nof the wheel.\r\n\r\n\'I made it on purpose for you, Miss Garland,\' he said.\r\n\r\nShe thanked him very warmly, for she had never seen anything like such an\r\ninstrument before, and it interested her.  \'It was very thoughtful of you\r\nto make it,\' she added.  \'How came you to think of such a thing?\'\r\n\r\n\'O I don\'t know exactly,\' he replied, as if he did not care to be\r\nquestioned on the point.  \'I have never made one in my life till now.\'\r\n\r\nEvery night after this, during the mournful gales of autumn, the strange\r\nmixed music of water, wind, and strings met her ear, swelling and sinking\r\nwith an almost supernatural cadence.  The character of the instrument was\r\nfar enough removed from anything she had hitherto seen of Bob\'s hobbies;\r\nso that she marvelled pleasantly at the new depths of poetry this\r\ncontrivance revealed as existent in that young seaman\'s nature, and\r\nallowed her emotions to flow out yet a little further in the old\r\ndirection, notwithstanding her late severe resolve to bar them back.\r\n\r\nOne breezy night, when the mill was kept going into the small hours, and\r\nthe wind was exactly in the direction of the water-current, the music so\r\nmingled with her dreams as to wake her: it seemed to rhythmically set\r\nitself to the words, \'Remember me! think of me!\'  She was much impressed;\r\nthe sounds were almost too touching; and she spoke to Bob the next\r\nmorning on the subject.\r\n\r\n\'How strange it is that you should have thought of fixing that harp where\r\nthe water gushes!\' she gently observed.  \'It affects me almost painfully\r\nat night.  You are poetical, Captain Bob.  But it is too--too sad!\'\r\n\r\n\'I will take it away,\' said Captain Bob promptly.  \'It certainly is too\r\nsad; I thought so myself.  I myself was kept awake by it one night.\'\r\n\r\n\'How came you to think of making such a peculiar thing?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said Bob, \'it is hardly worth saying why.  It is not a good place\r\nfor such a queer noisy machine; and I\'ll take it away.\'\r\n\r\n\'On second thoughts,\' said Anne, \'I should like it to remain a little\r\nlonger, because it sets me thinking.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of me?\' he asked with earnest frankness.\r\n\r\nAnne\'s colour rose fast.\r\n\r\n\'Well, yes,\' she said, trying to infuse much plain matter-of-fact into\r\nher voice.  \'Of course I am led to think of the person who invented it.\'\r\n\r\nBob seemed unaccountably embarrassed, and the subject was not pursued.\r\nAbout half-an-hour later he came to her again, with something of an\r\nuneasy look.\r\n\r\n\'There was a little matter I didn\'t tell you just now, Miss Garland,\' he\r\nsaid.  \'About that harp thing, I mean.  I did make it, certainly, but it\r\nwas my brother John who asked me to do it, just before he went away.  John\r\nis very musical, as you know, and he said it would interest you; but as\r\nhe didn\'t ask me to tell, I did not.  Perhaps I ought to have, and not\r\nhave taken the credit to myself.\'\r\n\r\n\'O, it is nothing!\' said Anne quickly.  \'It is a very incomplete\r\ninstrument after all, and it will be just as well for you to take it away\r\nas you first proposed.\'\r\n\r\nHe said that he would, but he forgot to do it that day; and the following\r\nnight there was a high wind, and the harp cried and moaned so movingly\r\nthat Anne, whose window was quite near, could hardly bear the sound with\r\nits new associations.  John Loveday was present to her mind all night as\r\nan ill-used man; and yet she could not own that she had ill-used him.\r\n\r\nThe harp was removed next day.  Bob, feeling that his credit for\r\noriginality was damaged in her eyes, by way of recovering it set himself\r\nto paint the summer-house which Anne frequented, and when he came out he\r\nassured her that it was quite his own idea.\r\n\r\n\'It wanted doing, certainly,\' she said, in a neutral tone.\r\n\r\n\'It is just about troublesome.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; you can\'t quite reach up.  That\'s because you are not very tall; is\r\nit not, Captain Loveday?\'\r\n\r\n\'You never used to say things like that.\'\r\n\r\n\'O, I don\'t mean that you are much less than tall!  Shall I hold the\r\npaint for you, to save your stepping down?\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, if you would.\'\r\n\r\nShe took the paint-pot, and stood looking at the brush as it moved up and\r\ndown in his hand.\r\n\r\n\'I hope I shall not sprinkle your fingers,\' he observed as he dipped.\r\n\r\n\'O, that would not matter!  You do it very well.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am glad to hear that you think so.\'\r\n\r\n\'But perhaps not quite so much art is demanded to paint a summer-house as\r\nto paint a picture?\'\r\n\r\nThinking that, as a painter\'s daughter, and a person of education\r\nsuperior to his own, she spoke with a flavour of sarcasm, he felt humbled\r\nand said--\r\n\r\n\'You did not use to talk like that to me.\'\r\n\r\n\'I was perhaps too young then to take any pleasure in giving pain,\' she\r\nobserved daringly.\r\n\r\n\'Does it give you pleasure?\'\r\n\r\nAnne nodded.\r\n\r\n\'I like to give pain to people who have given pain to me,\' she said\r\nsmartly, without removing her eyes from the green liquid in her hand.\r\n\r\n\'I ask your pardon for that.\'\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t say I meant you--though I did mean you.\'\r\n\r\nBob looked and looked at her side face till he was bewitched into putting\r\ndown his brush.\r\n\r\n\'It was that stupid forgetting of \'ee for a time!\' he exclaimed.  \'Well,\r\nI hadn\'t seen you for so very long--consider how many years!  O, dear\r\nAnne!\' he said, advancing to take her hand, \'how well we knew one another\r\nwhen we were children!  You was a queen to me then; and so you are now,\r\nand always.\'\r\n\r\nPossibly Anne was thrilled pleasantly enough at having brought the truant\r\nvillage lad to her feet again; but he was not to find the situation so\r\neasy as he imagined, and her hand was not to be taken yet.\r\n\r\n\'Very pretty!\' she said, laughing.  \'And only six weeks since Miss\r\nJohnson left.\'\r\n\r\n\'Zounds, don\'t say anything about that!\' implored Bob.  \'I swear that I\r\nnever--never deliberately loved her--for a long time together, that is;\r\nit was a sudden sort of thing, you know.  But towards you--I have more or\r\nless honoured and respectfully loved you, off and on, all my life.  There,\r\nthat\'s true.\'\r\n\r\nAnne retorted quickly--\r\n\r\n\'I am willing, off and on, to believe you, Captain Robert.  But I don\'t\r\nsee any good in your making these solemn declarations.\'\r\n\r\n\'Give me leave to explain, dear Miss Garland.  It is to get you to be\r\npleased to renew an old promise--made years ago--that you\'ll think o\'\r\nme.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not a word of any promise will I repeat.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, well, I won\'t urge \'ee to-day.  Only let me beg of you to get over\r\nthe quite wrong notion you have of me; and it shall be my whole endeavour\r\nto fetch your gracious favour.\'\r\n\r\nAnne turned away from him and entered the house, whither in the course of\r\na quarter of an hour he followed her, knocking at her door, and asking to\r\nbe let in.  She said she was busy; whereupon he went away, to come back\r\nagain in a short time and receive the same answer.\r\n\r\n\'I have finished painting the summer-house for you,\' he said through the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\'I cannot come to see it.  I shall be engaged till supper-time.\'\r\n\r\nShe heard him breathe a heavy sigh and withdraw, murmuring something\r\nabout his bad luck in being cut away from the starn like this.  But it\r\nwas not over yet.  When supper-time came and they sat down together, she\r\ntook upon herself to reprove him for what he had said to her in the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nBob made his forehead express despair.\r\n\r\n\'Now, I beg you this one thing,\' he said.  \'Just let me know your whole\r\nmind.  Then I shall have a chance to confess my faults and mend them, or\r\nclear my conduct to your satisfaction.\'\r\n\r\nShe answered with quickness, but not loud enough to be heard by the old\r\npeople at the other end of the table--\'Then, Captain Loveday, I will tell\r\nyou one thing, one fault, that perhaps would have been more proper to my\r\ncharacter than to yours.  You are too easily impressed by new faces, and\r\nthat gives me a _bad opinion_ of you--yes, a _bad opinion_.\'\r\n\r\n\'O, that\'s it!\' said Bob slowly, looking at her with the intense respect\r\nof a pupil for a master, her words being spoken in a manner so precisely\r\nbetween jest and earnest that he was in some doubt how they were to be\r\nreceived.  \'Impressed by new faces.  It is wrong, certainly, of me.\'\r\n\r\nThe popping of a cork, and the pouring out of strong beer by the miller\r\nwith a view to giving it a head, were apparently distractions sufficient\r\nto excuse her in not attending further to him; and during the remainder\r\nof the sitting her gentle chiding seemed to be sinking seriously into his\r\nmind.  Perhaps her own heart ached to see how silent he was; but she had\r\nalways meant to punish him.  Day after day for two or three weeks she\r\npreserved the same demeanour, with a self-control which did justice to\r\nher character.  And, on his part, considering what he had to put up\r\nwith--how she eluded him, snapped him off, refused to come out when he\r\ncalled her, refused to see him when he wanted to enter the little parlour\r\nwhich she had now appropriated to her private use, his patience testified\r\nstrongly to his good-humour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.  MILITARY PREPARATIONS ON AN EXTENDED SCALE\r\n\r\n\r\nChristmas had passed.  Dreary winter with dark evenings had given place\r\nto more dreary winter with light evenings.  Rapid thaws had ended in\r\nrain, rain in wind, wind in dust.  Showery days had come--the season of\r\npink dawns and white sunsets; and people hoped that the March weather was\r\nover.\r\n\r\nThe chief incident that concerned the household at the mill was that the\r\nmiller, following the example of all his neighbours, had become a\r\nvolunteer, and duly appeared twice a week in a red, long-tailed military\r\ncoat, pipe-clayed breeches, black cloth gaiters, a heel-balled helmet-\r\nhat, with a tuft of green wool, and epaulettes of the same colour and\r\nmaterial.  Bob still remained neutral.  Not being able to decide whether\r\nto enrol himself as a sea-fencible, a local militia-man, or a volunteer,\r\nhe simply went on dancing attendance upon Anne.  Mrs. Loveday had become\r\nawake to the fact that the pair of young people stood in a curious\r\nattitude towards each other; but as they were never seen with their heads\r\ntogether, and scarcely ever sat even in the same room, she could not be\r\nsure what their movements meant.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough (or perhaps naturally enough), since entering the\r\nLoveday family herself, she had gradually grown to think less favourably\r\nof Anne doing the same thing, and reverted to her original idea of\r\nencouraging Festus; this more particularly because he had of late shown\r\nsuch perseverance in haunting the precincts of the mill, presumably with\r\nthe intention of lighting upon the young girl.  But the weather had kept\r\nher mostly indoors.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon it was raining in torrents.  Such leaves as there were on\r\ntrees at this time of year--those of the laurel and other\r\nevergreens--staggered beneath the hard blows of the drops which fell upon\r\nthem, and afterwards could be seen trickling down the stems beneath and\r\nsilently entering the ground.  The surface of the mill-pond leapt up in a\r\nthousand spirts under the same downfall, and clucked like a hen in the\r\nrat-holes along the banks as it undulated under the wind.  The only dry\r\nspot visible from the front windows of the mill-house was the inside of a\r\nsmall shed, on the opposite side of the courtyard.  While Mrs. Loveday\r\nwas noticing the threads of rain descending across its interior shade,\r\nFestus Derriman walked up and entered it for shelter, which, owing to the\r\nlumber within, it but scantily afforded to a man who would have been a\r\nmatch for one of Frederick William\'s Patagonians.\r\n\r\nIt was an excellent opportunity for helping on her scheme.  Anne was in\r\nthe back room, and by asking him in till the rain was over she would\r\nbring him face to face with her daughter, whom, as the days went on, she\r\nincreasingly wished to marry other than a Loveday, now that the romance\r\nof her own alliance with the millet had in some respects worn off.  She\r\nwas better provided for than before; she was not unhappy; but the plain\r\nfact was that she had married beneath her.  She beckoned to Festus\r\nthrough the window-pane; he instantly complied with her signal, having in\r\nfact placed himself there on purpose to be noticed; for he knew that Miss\r\nGarland would not be out-of-doors on such a day.\r\n\r\n\'Good afternoon, Mrs. Loveday,\' said Festus on entering.  \'There now--if\r\nI didn\'t think that\'s how it would be!\'  His voice had suddenly warmed to\r\nanger, for he had seen a door close in the back part of the room, a lithe\r\nfigure having previously slipped through.\r\n\r\nMrs. Loveday turned, observed that Anne was gone, and said, \'What is it?\'\r\nas if she did not know.\r\n\r\n\'O, nothing, nothing!\' said Festus crossly.  \'You know well enough what\r\nit is, ma\'am; only you make pretence otherwise.  But I\'ll bring her to\r\nbook yet.  You shall drop your haughty airs, my charmer!  She little\r\nthinks I have kept an account of \'em all.\'\r\n\r\n\'But you must treat her politely, sir,\' said Mrs. Loveday, secretly\r\npleased at these signs of uncontrollable affection.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t tell me of politeness or generosity, ma\'am!  She is more than a\r\nmatch for me.  She regularly gets over me.  I have passed by this house\r\nfive-and-fifty times since last Martinmas, and this is all my reward\r\nfor\'t!\'\r\n\r\n\'But you will stay till the rain is over, sir?\'\r\n\r\n\'No.  I don\'t mind rain.  I\'m off again.  She\'s got somebody else in her\r\neye!\'  And the yeoman went out, slamming the door.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the slippery object of his hopes had gone along the dark\r\npassage, passed the trap which opened on the wheel, and through the door\r\ninto the mill, where she was met by Bob, who looked up from the flour-\r\nshoot inquiringly and said, \'You want me, Miss Garland?\'\r\n\r\n\'O no,\' said she.  \'I only want to be allowed to stand here a few\r\nminutes.\'\r\n\r\nHe looked at her to know if she meant it, and finding that she did,\r\nreturned to his post.  When the mill had rumbled on a little longer he\r\ncame back.\r\n\r\n\'Bob,\' she said, when she saw him move, \'remember that you are at work,\r\nand have no time to stand close to me.\'\r\n\r\nHe bowed and went to his original post again, Anne watching from the\r\nwindow till Festus should leave.  The mill rumbled on as before, and at\r\nlast Bob came to her for the third time.  \'Now, Bob--\' she began.\r\n\r\n\'On my honour, \'tis only to ask a question.  Will you walk with me to\r\nchurch next Sunday afternoon?\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps I will,\' she said.  But at this moment the yeoman left the\r\nhouse, and Anne, to escape further parley, returned to the dwelling by\r\nthe way she had come.\r\n\r\nSunday afternoon arrived, and the family was standing at the door waiting\r\nfor the church bells to begin.  From that side of the house they could\r\nsee southward across a paddock to the rising ground further ahead, where\r\nthere grew a large elm-tree, beneath whose boughs footpaths crossed in\r\ndifferent directions, like meridians at the pole.  The tree was old, and\r\nin summer the grass beneath it was quite trodden away by the feet of the\r\nmany trysters and idlers who haunted the spot.  The tree formed a\r\nconspicuous object in the surrounding landscape.\r\n\r\nWhile they looked, a foot soldier in red uniform and white breeches came\r\nalong one of the paths, and stopping beneath the elm, took from his\r\npocket a paper, which he proceeded to nail up by the four corners to the\r\ntrunk.  He drew back, looked at it, and went on his way.  Bob got his\r\nglass from indoors and levelled it at the placard, but after looking for\r\na long time he could make out nothing but a lion and a unicorn at the\r\ntop.  Anne, who was ready for church, moved away from the door, though it\r\nwas yet early, and showed her intention of going by way of the elm.  The\r\npaper had been so impressively nailed up that she was curious to read it\r\neven at this theological time.  Bob took the opportunity of following,\r\nand reminded her of her promise.\r\n\r\n\'Then walk behind me not at all close,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' he replied, immediately dropping behind.\r\n\r\nThe ludicrous humility of his manner led her to add playfully over her\r\nshoulder, \'It serves you right, you know.\'\r\n\r\n\'I deserve anything, but I must take the liberty to say that I hope my\r\nbehaviour about Matil--, in forgetting you awhile, will not make ye wish\r\nto keep me _always_ behind?\'\r\n\r\nShe replied confidentially, \'Why I am so earnest not to be seen with you\r\nis that I may appear to people to be independent of you.  Knowing what I\r\ndo of your weaknesses I can do no otherwise.  You must be schooled into--\'\r\n\r\n\'O, Anne,\' sighed Bob, \'you hit me hard--too hard!  If ever I do win you\r\nI am sure I shall have fairly earned you.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are not what you once seemed to be,\' she returned softly.  \'I don\'t\r\nquite like to let myself love you.\'  The last words were not very\r\naudible, and as Bob was behind he caught nothing of them, nor did he see\r\nhow sentimental she had become all of a sudden.  They walked the rest of\r\nthe way in silence, and coming to the tree read as follows:--\r\n\r\n   ADDRESS TO ALL RANKS AND DESCRIPTIONS OF ENGLISHMEN.\r\n\r\n   FRIENDS AND COUNTRYMEN,--The French are now assembling the largest\r\n   force that ever was prepared to invade this Kingdom, with the\r\n   professed purpose of effecting our complete Ruin and Destruction.  They\r\n   do not disguise their intentions, as they have often done to other\r\n   Countries; but openly boast that they will come over in such Numbers\r\n   as cannot be resisted.\r\n\r\n   Wherever the French have lately appeared they have spared neither Rich\r\n   nor Poor, Old nor Young; but like a Destructive Pestilence have laid\r\n   waste and destroyed every Thing that before was fair and flourishing.\r\n\r\n   On this occasion no man\'s service is compelled, but you are invited\r\n   voluntarily to come forward in defence of everything that is dear to\r\n   you, by entering your Names on the Lists which are sent to the Tything-\r\n   man of every Parish, and engaging to act either as _Associated\r\n   Volunteers bearing Arms_, _as Pioneers and Labourers_, or as _Drivers\r\n   of Waggons_.\r\n\r\n   As Associated Volunteers you will be called out only once a week,\r\n   unless the actual Landing of the Enemy should render your further\r\n   Services necessary.\r\n\r\n   As Pioneers or Labourers you will be employed in Breaking up Roads to\r\n   hinder the Enemy\'s advance.\r\n\r\n   Those who have Pickaxes, Spades, Shovels, Bill-hooks, or other Working\r\n   Implements, are desired to mention them to the Constable or Tything-\r\n   man of their Parish, in order that they may be entered on the Lists\r\n   opposite their Homes, to be used if necessary. . . .\r\n\r\n   It is thought desirable to give you this Explanation, that you may not\r\n   be ignorant of the Duties to which you may be called.  But if the love\r\n   of true Liberty and honest Fame has not ceased to animate the Hearts\r\n   of Englishmen, Pay, though necessary, will be the least Part of your\r\n   Reward.  You will find your best Recompense in having done your Duty\r\n   to your King and Country by driving back or destroying your old and\r\n   implacable Enemy, envious of your Freedom and Happiness, and therefore\r\n   seeking to destroy them; in having protected your Wives and Children\r\n   from Death, or worse than Death, which will follow the Success of such\r\n   Inveterate Foes.\r\n\r\n   ROUSE, therefore, and unite as one man in the best of Causes!  United\r\n   we may defy the World to conquer us; but Victory will never belong to\r\n   those who are slothful and unprepared. {207}\r\n\r\n\'I must go and join at once!\' said Bob.\r\n\r\nAnne turned to him, all the playfulness gone from her face.  \'I wish we\r\nlived in the north of England, Bob, so as to be further away from where\r\nhe\'ll land!\' she murmured uneasily.\r\n\r\n\'Where we are would be Paradise to me, if you would only make it so.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is not right to talk so lightly at such a serious time,\' she\r\nthoughtfully returned, going on towards the church.\r\n\r\nOn drawing near, they saw through the boughs of a clump of intervening\r\ntrees, still leafless, but bursting into buds of amber hue, a glittering\r\nwhich seemed to be reflected from points of steel.  In a few moments they\r\nheard above the tender chiming of the church bells the loud voice of a\r\nman giving words of command, at which all the metallic points suddenly\r\nshifted like the bristles of a porcupine, and glistened anew.\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis the drilling,\' said Loveday.  \'They drill now between the services,\r\nyou know, because they can\'t get the men together so readily in the week.\r\nIt makes me feel that I ought to be doing more than I am!\'\r\n\r\nWhen they had passed round the belt of trees, the company of recruits\r\nbecame visible, consisting of the able-bodied inhabitants of the hamlets\r\nthereabout, more or less known to Bob and Anne.  They were assembled on\r\nthe green plot outside the churchyard-gate, dressed in their common\r\nclothes, and the sergeant who had been putting them through their drill\r\nwas the man who nailed up the proclamation.  He was now engaged in\r\nuntying a canvas money-bag, from which he drew forth a handful of\r\nshillings, giving one to each man in payment for his attendance.\r\n\r\n\'Men, I dismissed ye too soon--parade, parade again, I say,\' he cried.\r\n\'My watch is fast, I find.  There\'s another twenty minutes afore the\r\nworship of God commences.  Now all of you that ha\'n\'t got firelocks, fall\r\nin at the lower end.  Eyes right and dress!\'\r\n\r\nAs every man was anxious to see how the rest stood, those at the end of\r\nthe line pressed forward for that purpose, till the line assumed the form\r\nof a bow.\r\n\r\n\'Look at ye now!  Why, you are all a crooking in!  Dress, dress!\'\r\n\r\nThey dressed forthwith; but impelled by the same motive they soon resumed\r\ntheir former figure, and so they were despairingly permitted to remain.\r\n\r\n\'Now, I hope you\'ll have a little patience,\' said the sergeant, as he\r\nstood in the centre of the arc, \'and pay strict attention to the word of\r\ncommand, just exactly as I give it out to ye; and if I should go wrong, I\r\nshall be much obliged to any friend who\'ll put me right again, for I have\r\nonly been in the army three weeks myself, and we are all liable to\r\nmistakes.\'\r\n\r\n\'So we be, so we be,\' said the line heartily.\r\n\r\n\'\'Tention, the whole, then.  Poise fawlocks!  Very well done!\'\r\n\r\n\'Please, what must we do that haven\'t got no firelocks!\' said the lower\r\nend of the line in a helpless voice.\r\n\r\n\'Now, was ever such a question!  Why, you must do nothing at all, but\r\nthink _how_ you\'d poise \'em _if_ you had \'em.  You middle men, that are\r\narmed with hurdle-sticks and cabbage-stumps just to make-believe, must of\r\ncourse use \'em as if they were the real thing.  Now then, cock fawlocks!\r\nPresent!  Fire! (Pretend to, I mean, and the same time throw yer\r\nimagination into the field o\' battle.)  Very good--very good indeed;\r\nexcept that some of you were a _little_ too soon, and the rest a _little_\r\ntoo late.\'\r\n\r\n\'Please, sergeant, can I fall out, as I am master-player in the choir,\r\nand my bass-viol strings won\'t stand at this time o\' year, unless they be\r\nscrewed up a little before the passon comes in?\'\r\n\r\n\'How can you think of such trifles as churchgoing at such a time as this,\r\nwhen your own native country is on the point of invasion?\' said the\r\nsergeant sternly.  \'And, as you know, the drill ends three minutes afore\r\nchurch begins, and that\'s the law, and it wants a quarter of an hour yet.\r\nNow, at the word _Prime_, shake the powder (supposing you\'ve got it) into\r\nthe priming-pan, three last fingers behind the rammer; then shut your\r\npans, drawing your right arm nimble-like towards your body.  I ought to\r\nhave told ye before this, that at _Hand your katridge_, seize it and\r\nbring it with a quick motion to your mouth, bite the top well off, and\r\ndon\'t swaller so much of the powder as to make ye hawk and spet instead\r\nof attending to your drill.  What\'s that man a-saying of in the rear\r\nrank?\'\r\n\r\n\'Please, sir, \'tis Anthony Cripplestraw, wanting to know how he\'s to bite\r\noff his katridge, when he haven\'t a tooth left in \'s head?\'\r\n\r\n\'Man!  Why, what\'s your genius for war?  Hold it up to your right-hand\r\nman\'s mouth, to be sure, and let him nip it off for ye.  Well, what have\r\nyou to say, Private Tremlett?  Don\'t ye understand English?\'\r\n\r\n\'Ask yer pardon, sergeant; but what must we infantry of the awkward squad\r\ndo if Boney comes afore we get our firelocks?\'\r\n\r\n\'Take a pike, like the rest of the incapables.  You\'ll find a store of\r\nthem ready in the corner of the church tower.  Now then--Shoulder--r--r--r--\'\r\n\r\n\'There, they be tinging in the passon!\' exclaimed David, Miller Loveday\'s\r\nman, who also formed one of the company, as the bells changed from\r\nchiming all three together to a quick beating of one.  The whole line\r\ndrew a breath of relief, threw down their arms, and began running off.\r\n\r\n\'Well, then, I must dismiss ye,\' said the sergeant.  \'Come back--come\r\nback!  Next drill is Tuesday afternoon at four.  And, mind, if your\r\nmasters won\'t let ye leave work soon enough, tell me, and I\'ll write a\r\nline to Gover\'ment!  \'Tention!  To the right--left wheel, I mean--no,\r\nno--right wheel.  Mar--r--r--rch!\'\r\n\r\nSome wheeled to the right and some to the left, and some obliging men,\r\nincluding Cripplestraw, tried to wheel both ways.\r\n\r\n\'Stop, stop; try again!  \'Cruits and comrades, unfortunately when I\'m in\r\na hurry I can never remember my right hand from my left, and never could\r\nas a boy.  You must excuse me, please.  Practice makes perfect, as the\r\nsaying is; and, much as I\'ve learnt since I \'listed, we always find\r\nsomething new.  Now then, right wheel! march! halt!  Stand at ease!\r\ndismiss!  I think that\'s the order o\'t, but I\'ll look in the Gover\'ment\r\nbook afore Tuesday.\' {211}\r\n\r\nMany of the company who had been drilled preferred to go off and spend\r\ntheir shillings instead of entering the church; but Anne and Captain Bob\r\npassed in.  Even the interior of the sacred edifice was affected by the\r\nagitation of the times.  The religion of the country had, in fact,\r\nchanged from love of God to hatred of Napoleon Buonaparte; and, as if to\r\nremind the devout of this alteration, the pikes for the pikemen (all\r\nthose accepted men who were not otherwise armed) were kept in the church\r\nof each parish.  There, against the wall, they always stood--a whole\r\nsheaf of them, formed of new ash stems, with a spike driven in at one\r\nend, the stick being preserved from splitting by a ferule.  And there\r\nthey remained, year after year, in the corner of the aisle, till they\r\nwere removed and placed under the gallery stairs, and thence ultimately\r\nto the belfry, where they grew black, rusty, and worm-eaten, and were\r\ngradually stolen and carried off by sextons, parish clerks, whitewashers,\r\nwindow-menders, and other church servants for use at home as rake-stems,\r\nbenefit-club staves, and pick-handles, in which degraded situations they\r\nmay still occasionally be found.\r\n\r\nBut in their new and shining state they had a terror for Anne, whose eyes\r\nwere involuntarily drawn towards them as she sat at Bob\'s side during the\r\nservice, filling her with bloody visions of their possible use not far\r\nfrom the very spot on which they were now assembled.  The sermon, too,\r\nwas on the subject of patriotism; so that when they came out she began to\r\nharp uneasily upon the probability of their all being driven from their\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\nBob assured her that with the sixty thousand regulars, the militia\r\nreserve of a hundred and twenty thousand, and the three hundred thousand\r\nvolunteers, there was not much to fear.\r\n\r\n\'But I sometimes have a fear that poor John will be killed,\' he continued\r\nafter a pause.  \'He is sure to be among the first that will have to face\r\nthe invaders, and the trumpeters get picked off.\'\r\n\r\n\'There is the same chance for him as for the others,\' said Anne.\r\n\r\n\'Yes--yes--the same chance, such as it is.  You have never liked John\r\nsince that affair of Matilda Johnson, have you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why?\' she quickly asked.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said Bob timidly, \'as it is a ticklish time for him, would it not\r\nbe worth while to make up any differences before the crash comes?\'\r\n\r\n\'I have nothing to make up,\' said Anne, with some distress.  She still\r\nfully believed the trumpet-major to have smuggled away Miss Johnson\r\nbecause of his own interest in that lady, which must have made his\r\nprofessions to herself a mere pastime; but that very conduct had in it\r\nthe curious advantage to herself of setting Bob free.\r\n\r\n\'Since John has been gone,\' continued her companion, \'I have found out\r\nmore of his meaning, and of what he really had to do with that woman\'s\r\nflight.  Did you know that he had anything to do with it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.\'\r\n\r\n\'That he got her to go away?\'\r\n\r\nShe looked at Bob with surprise.  He was not exasperated with John, and\r\nyet he knew so much as this.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' she said; \'what did it mean?\'\r\n\r\nHe did not explain to her then; but the possibility of John\'s death,\r\nwhich had been newly brought home to him by the military events of the\r\nday, determined him to get poor John\'s character cleared.  Reproaching\r\nhimself for letting her remain so long with a mistaken idea of him, Bob\r\nwent to his father as soon as they got home, and begged him to get Mrs.\r\nLoveday to tell Anne the true reason of John\'s objection to Miss Johnson\r\nas a sister-in-law.\r\n\r\n\'She thinks it is because they were old lovers new met, and that he wants\r\nto marry her,\' he exclaimed to his father in conclusion.\r\n\r\n\'Then _that\'s_ the meaning of the split between Miss Nancy and Jack,\'\r\nsaid the miller.\r\n\r\n\'What, were they any more than common friends?\' asked Bob uneasily.\r\n\r\n\'Not on her side, perhaps.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, we must do it,\' replied Bob, painfully conscious that common\r\njustice to John might bring them into hazardous rivalry, yet determined\r\nto be fair.  \'Tell it all to Mrs. Loveday, and get her to tell Anne.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV.  A LETTER, A VISITOR, AND A TIN BOX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result of the explanation upon Anne was bitter self-reproach.  She\r\nwas so sorry at having wronged the kindly soldier that next morning she\r\nwent by herself to the down, and stood exactly where his tent had covered\r\nthe sod on which he had lain so many nights, thinking what sadness he\r\nmust have suffered because of her at the time of packing up and going\r\naway.  After that she wiped from her eyes the tears of pity which had\r\ncome there, descended to the house, and wrote an impulsive letter to him,\r\nin which occurred the following passages, indiscreet enough under the\r\ncircumstances:--\r\n\r\n   \'I find all justice, all rectitude, on your side, John; and all\r\n   impertinence, all inconsiderateness, on mine.  I am so much convinced\r\n   of your honour in the whole transaction, that I shall for the future\r\n   mistrust myself in everything.  And if it be possible, whenever I\r\n   differ from you on any point I shall take an hour\'s time for\r\n   consideration before I say that I differ.  If I have lost your\r\n   friendship, I have only myself to thank for it; but I sincerely hope\r\n   that you can forgive.\'\r\n\r\nAfter writing this she went to the garden, where Bob was shearing the\r\nspring grass from the paths.  \'What is John\'s direction?\' she said,\r\nholding the sealed letter in her hand.\r\n\r\n\'Exonbury Barracks,\' Bob faltered, his countenance sinking.\r\n\r\nShe thanked him and went indoors.  When he came in, later in the day, he\r\npassed the door of her empty sitting-room and saw the letter on the\r\nmantelpiece.  He disliked the sight of it.  Hearing voices in the other\r\nroom, he entered and found Anne and her mother there, talking to\r\nCripplestraw, who had just come in with a message from Squire Derriman,\r\nrequesting Miss Garland, as she valued the peace of mind of an old and\r\ntroubled man, to go at once and see him.\r\n\r\n\'I cannot go,\' she said, not liking the risk that such a visit involved.\r\n\r\nAn hour later Cripplestraw shambled again into the passage, on the same\r\nerrand.\r\n\r\n\'Maister\'s very poorly, and he hopes that you\'ll come, Mis\'ess Anne.  He\r\nwants to see \'ee very particular about the French.\'\r\n\r\nAnne would have gone in a moment, but for the fear that some one besides\r\nthe farmer might encounter her, and she answered as before.\r\n\r\nAnother hour passed, and the wheels of a vehicle were heard.  Cripplestraw\r\nhad come for the third time, with a horse and gig; he was dressed in his\r\nbest clothes, and brought with him on this occasion a basket containing\r\nraisins, almonds, oranges, and sweet cakes.  Offering them to her as a\r\ngift from the old farmer, he repeated his request for her to accompany\r\nhim, the gig and best mare having been sent as an additional inducement.\r\n\r\n\'I believe the old gentleman is in love with you, Anne,\' said her mother.\r\n\r\n\'Why couldn\'t he drive down himself to see me?\' Anne inquired of\r\nCripplestraw.\r\n\r\n\'He wants you at the house, please.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is Mr. Festus with him?\'\r\n\r\n\'No; he\'s away to Budmouth.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll go,\' said she.\r\n\r\n\'And I may come and meet you?\' said Bob.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s my letter--what shall I do about that?\' she said, instead of\r\nanswering him.  \'Take my letter to the post-office, and you may come,\'\r\nshe added.\r\n\r\nHe said yes and went out, Cripplestraw retreating to the door till she\r\nshould be ready.\r\n\r\n\'What letter is it?\' said her mother.\r\n\r\n\'Only one to John,\' said Anne.  \'I have asked him to forgive my\r\nsuspicions.  I could do no less.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you want to marry _him_?\' asked Mrs. Loveday bluntly.\r\n\r\n\'Mother!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well; he will take that letter as an encouragement.  Can\'t you see that\r\nhe will, you foolish girl?\'\r\n\r\nAnne did see instantly.  \'Of course!\' she said.  \'Tell Robert that he\r\nneed not go.\'\r\n\r\nShe went to her room to secure the letter.  It was gone from the\r\nmantelpiece, and on inquiry it was found that the miller, seeing it\r\nthere, had sent David with it to Budmouth hours ago.  Anne said nothing,\r\nand set out for Oxwell Hall with Cripplestraw.\r\n\r\n\'William,\' said Mrs. Loveday to the miller when Anne was gone and Bob had\r\nresumed his work in the garden, \'did you get that letter sent off on\r\npurpose?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I did.  I wanted to make sure of it.  John likes her, and now\r\n\'twill be made up; and why shouldn\'t he marry her?  I\'ll start him in\r\nbusiness, if so be she\'ll have him.\'\r\n\r\n\'But she is likely to marry Festus Derriman.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t want her to marry anybody but John,\' said the miller doggedly.\r\n\r\n\'Not if she is in love with Bob, and has been for years, and he with\r\nher?\' asked his wife triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\'In love with Bob, and he with her?\' repeated Loveday.\r\n\r\n\'Certainly,\' said she, going off and leaving him to his reflections.\r\n\r\nWhen Anne reached the hall she found old Mr. Derriman in his customary\r\nchair.  His complexion was more ashen, but his movement in rising at her\r\nentrance, putting a chair and shutting the door behind her, were much the\r\nsame as usual.\r\n\r\n\'Thank God you\'ve come, my dear girl,\' he said earnestly.  \'Ah, you don\'t\r\ntrip across to read to me now!  Why did ye cost me so much to fetch you?\r\nFie!  A horse and gig, and a man\'s time in going three times.  And what I\r\nsent ye cost a good deal in Budmouth market, now everything is so dear\r\nthere, and \'twould have cost more if I hadn\'t bought the raisins and\r\noranges some months ago, when they were cheaper.  I tell you this because\r\nwe are old friends, and I have nobody else to tell my troubles to.  But I\r\ndon\'t begrudge anything to ye since you\'ve come.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am not much pleased to come, even now,\' said she.  \'What can make you\r\nso seriously anxious to see me?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, you be a good girl and true; and I\'ve been thinking that of all\r\npeople of the next generation that I can trust, you are the best.  \'Tis\r\nmy bonds and my title-deeds, such as they be, and the leases, you know,\r\nand a few guineas in packets, and more than these, my will, that I have\r\nto speak about.  Now do ye come this way.\'\r\n\r\n\'O, such things as those!\' she returned, with surprise.  \'I don\'t\r\nunderstand those things at all.\'\r\n\r\n\'There\'s nothing to understand.  \'Tis just this.  The French will be here\r\nwithin two months; that\'s certain.  I have it on the best authority, that\r\nthe army at Boulogne is ready, the boats equipped, the plans laid, and\r\nthe First Consul only waits for a tide.  Heaven knows what will become o\'\r\nthe men o\' these parts!  But most likely the women will he spared.  Now\r\nI\'ll show \'ee.\'\r\n\r\nHe led her across the hall to a stone staircase of semi-circular plan,\r\nwhich conducted to the cellars.\r\n\r\n\'Down here?\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'Yes; I must trouble ye to come down here.  I have thought and thought\r\nwho is the woman that can best keep a secret for six months, and I say,\r\n"Anne Garland."  You won\'t be married before then?\'\r\n\r\n\'O no!\' murmured the young woman.\r\n\r\n\'I wouldn\'t expect ye to keep a close tongue after such a thing as that.\r\nBut it will not be necessary.\'\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the bottom of the steps he struck a light from a tinder-\r\nbox, and unlocked the middle one of three doors which appeared in the\r\nwhitewashed wall opposite.  The rays of the candle fell upon the vault\r\nand sides of a long low cellar, littered with decayed woodwork from other\r\nparts of the hall, among the rest stair-balusters, carved finials,\r\ntracery panels, and wainscoting.  But what most attracted her eye was a\r\nsmall flagstone turned up in the middle of the floor, a heap of earth\r\nbeside it, and a measuring-tape.  Derriman went to the corner of the\r\ncellar, and pulled out a clamped box from under the straw.  \'You be\r\nrather heavy, my dear, eh?\' he said, affectionately addressing the box as\r\nhe lifted it.  \'But you are going to be put in a safe place, you know, or\r\nthat rascal will get hold of ye, and carry ye off and ruin me.\'  He then\r\nwith some difficulty lowered the box into the hole, raked in the earth\r\nupon it, and lowered the flagstone, which he was a long time in fixing to\r\nhis satisfaction.  Miss Garland, who was romantically interested, helped\r\nhim to brush away the fragments of loose earth; and when he had scattered\r\nover the floor a little of the straw that lay about, they again ascended\r\nto upper air.\r\n\r\n\'Is this all, sir?\' said Anne.\r\n\r\n\'Just a moment longer, honey.  Will you come into the great parlour?\'\r\n\r\nShe followed him thither.\r\n\r\n\'If anything happens to me while the fighting is going on--it may be on\r\nthese very fields--you will know what to do,\' he resumed.  \'But first\r\nplease sit down again, there\'s a dear, whilst I write what\'s in my head.\r\nSee, there\'s the best paper, and a new quill that I\'ve afforded myself\r\nfor\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'What a strange business!  I don\'t think I much like it, Mr. Derriman,\'\r\nshe said, seating herself.\r\n\r\nHe had by this time begun to write, and murmured as he wrote--\r\n\r\n\'"Twenty-three and a half from N.W.  Sixteen and three-quarters from\r\nN.E."--There, that\'s all.  Now I seal it up and give it to you to keep\r\nsafe till I ask ye for it, or you hear of my being trampled down by the\r\nenemy.\'\r\n\r\n\'What does it mean?\' she asked, as she received the paper.\r\n\r\n\'Clk!  Ha! ha!  Why, that\'s the distance of the box from the two corners\r\nof the cellar.  I measured it before you came.  And, my honey, to make\r\nall sure, if the French soldiery are after ye, tell your mother the\r\nmeaning on\'t, or any other friend, in case they should put ye to death,\r\nand the secret be lost.  But that I am sure I hope they won\'t do, though\r\nyour pretty face will be a sad bait to the soldiers.  I often have wished\r\nyou was my daughter, honey; and yet in these times the less cares a man\r\nhas the better, so I am glad you bain\'t.  Shall my man drive you home?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no,\' she said, much depressed by the words he had uttered.  \'I can\r\nfind my way.  You need not trouble to come down.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then take care of the paper.  And if you outlive me, you\'ll find I have\r\nnot forgot you.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV.  FESTUS SHOWS HIS LOVE\r\n\r\n\r\nFestus Derriman had remained in the Royal watering-place all that day,\r\nhis horse being sick at stables; but, wishing to coax or bully from his\r\nuncle a remount for the coming summer, he set off on foot for Oxwell\r\nearly in the evening.  When he drew near to the village, or rather to the\r\nhall, which was a mile from the village, he overtook a slim, quick-eyed\r\nwoman, sauntering along at a leisurely pace.  She was fashionably dressed\r\nin a green spencer, with \'Mameluke\' sleeves, and wore a velvet Spanish\r\nhat and feather.\r\n\r\n\'Good afternoon t\'ye, ma\'am,\' said Festus, throwing a sword-and-pistol\r\nair into his greeting.  \'You are out for a walk?\'\r\n\r\n\'I _am_ out for a walk, captain,\' said the lady, who had criticized him\r\nfrom the crevice of her eye, without seeming to do much more than\r\ncontinue her demure look forward, and gave the title as a sop to his\r\napparent character.\r\n\r\n\'From the town?--I\'d swear it, ma\'am; \'pon my honour I would!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I am from the town, sir,\' said she.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, you are a visitor!  I know every one of the regular inhabitants; we\r\nsoldiers are in and out there continually.  Festus Derriman, Yeomanry\r\nCavalry, you know.  The fact is, the watering-place is under our charge;\r\nthe folks will be quite dependent upon us for their deliverance in the\r\ncoming struggle.  We hold our lives in our hands, and theirs, I may say,\r\nin our pockets.  What made you come here, ma\'am, at such a critical\r\ntime?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t see that it is such a critical time?\'\r\n\r\n\'But it is, though; and so you\'d say if you was as much mixed up with the\r\nmilitary affairs of the nation as some of us.\'\r\n\r\nThe lady smiled.  \'The King is coming this year, anyhow,\' said she.\r\n\r\n\'Never!\' said Festus firmly.  \'Ah, you are one of the attendants at court\r\nperhaps, come on ahead to get the King\'s chambers ready, in case Boney\r\nshould not land?\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' she said; \'I am connected with the theatre, though not just at the\r\npresent moment.  I have been out of luck for the last year or two; but I\r\nhave fetched up again.  I join the company when they arrive for the\r\nseason.\'\r\n\r\nFestus surveyed her with interest.  \'Faith! and is it so?  Well, ma\'am,\r\nwhat part do you play?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am mostly the leading lady--the heroine,\' she said, drawing herself up\r\nwith dignity.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll come and have a look at ye if all\'s well, and the landing is put\r\noff--hang me if I don\'t!--Hullo, hullo, what do I see?\'\r\n\r\nHis eyes were stretched towards a distant field, which Anne Garland was\r\nat that moment hastily crossing, on her way from the hall to Overcombe.\r\n\r\n\'I must be off.  Good-day to ye, dear creature!\' he exclaimed, hurrying\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nThe lady said, \'O, you droll monster!\' as she smiled and watched him\r\nstride ahead.\r\n\r\nFestus bounded on over the hedge, across the intervening patch of green,\r\nand into the field which Anne was still crossing.  In a moment or two she\r\nlooked back, and seeing the well-known Herculean figure of the yeoman\r\nbehind her felt rather alarmed, though she determined to show no\r\ndifference in her outward carriage.  But to maintain her natural gait was\r\nbeyond her powers.  She spasmodically quickened her pace; fruitlessly,\r\nhowever, for he gained upon her, and when within a few strides of her\r\nexclaimed, \'Well, my darling!\'  Anne started off at a run.\r\n\r\nFestus was already out of breath, and soon found that he was not likely\r\nto overtake her.  On she went, without turning her head, till an unusual\r\nnoise behind compelled her to look round.  His face was in the act of\r\nfalling back; he swerved on one side, and dropped like a log upon a\r\nconvenient hedgerow-bank which bordered the path.  There he lay quite\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nAnne was somewhat alarmed; and after standing at gaze for two or three\r\nminutes, drew nearer to him, a step and a half at a time, wondering and\r\ndoubting, as a meek ewe draws near to some strolling vagabond who flings\r\nhimself on the grass near the flock.\r\n\r\n\'He is in a swoon!\' she murmured.\r\n\r\nHer heart beat quickly, and she looked around.  Nobody was in sight; she\r\nadvanced a step nearer still and observed him again.  Apparently his face\r\nwas turning to a livid hue, and his breathing had become obstructed.\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis not a swoon; \'tis apoplexy!\' she said, in deep distress.  \'I ought\r\nto untie his neck.\'  But she was afraid to do this, and only drew a\r\nlittle closer still.\r\n\r\nMiss Garland was now within three feet of him, whereupon the senseless\r\nman, who could hold his breath no longer, sprang to his feet and darted\r\nat her, saying, \'Ha! ha! a scheme for a kiss!\'\r\n\r\nShe felt his arm slipping round her neck; but, twirling about with\r\namazing dexterity, she wriggled from his embrace and ran away along the\r\nfield.  The force with which she had extricated herself was sufficient to\r\nthrow Festus upon the grass, and by the time that he got upon his legs\r\nagain she was many yards off.  Uttering a word which was not exactly a\r\nblessing, he immediately gave chase; and thus they ran till Anne entered\r\na meadow divided down the middle by a brook about six feet wide.  A\r\nnarrow plank was thrown loosely across at the point where the path\r\ntraversed this stream, and when Anne reached it she at once scampered\r\nover.  At the other side she turned her head to gather the probabilities\r\nof the situation, which were that Festus Derriman would overtake her even\r\nnow.  By a sudden forethought she stooped, seized the end of the plank,\r\nand endeavoured to drag it away from the opposite bank.  But the weight\r\nwas too great for her to do more than slightly move it, and with a\r\ndesperate sigh she ran on again, having lost many valuable seconds.\r\n\r\nBut her attempt, though ineffectual in dragging it down, had been enough\r\nto unsettle the little bridge; and when Derriman reached the middle,\r\nwhich he did half a minute later, the plank turned over on its edge,\r\ntilting him bodily into the river.  The water was not remarkably deep,\r\nbut as the yeoman fell flat on his stomach he was completely immersed;\r\nand it was some time before he could drag himself out.  When he arose,\r\ndripping on the bank, and looked around, Anne had vanished from the mead.\r\nThen Festus\'s eyes glowed like carbuncles, and he gave voice to fearful\r\nimprecations, shaking his fist in the soft summer air towards Anne, in a\r\nway that was terrible for any maiden to behold.  Wading back through the\r\nstream, he walked along its bank with a heavy tread, the water running\r\nfrom his coat-tails, wrists, and the tips of his ears, in silvery\r\ndribbles, that sparkled pleasantly in the sun.  Thus he hastened away,\r\nand went round by a by-path to the hall.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the author of his troubles was rapidly drawing nearer to the\r\nmill, and soon, to her inexpressible delight, she saw Bob coming to meet\r\nher.  She had heard the flounce, and, feeling more secure from her\r\npursuer, had dropped her pace to a quick walk.  No sooner did she reach\r\nBob than, overcome by the excitement of the moment, she flung herself\r\ninto his arms.  Bob instantly enclosed her in an embrace so very thorough\r\nthat there was no possible danger of her falling, whatever degree of\r\nexhaustion might have given rise to her somewhat unexpected action; and\r\nin this attitude they silently remained, till it was borne in upon Anne\r\nthat the present was the first time in her life that she had ever been in\r\nsuch a position.  Her face then burnt like a sunset, and she did not know\r\nhow to look up at him.  Feeling at length quite safe, she suddenly\r\nresolved not to give way to her first impulse to tell him the whole of\r\nwhat had happened, lest there should be a dreadful quarrel and fight\r\nbetween Bob and the yeoman, and great difficulties caused in the Loveday\r\nfamily on her account, the miller having important wheat transactions\r\nwith the Derrimans.\r\n\r\n\'You seem frightened, dearest Anne,\' said Bob tenderly.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' she replied.  \'I saw a man I did not like the look of, and he was\r\ninclined to follow me.  But, worse than that, I am troubled about the\r\nFrench.  O Bob! I am afraid you will be killed, and my mother, and John,\r\nand your father, and all of us hunted down!\'\r\n\r\n\'Now I have told you, dear little heart, that it cannot be.  We shall\r\ndrive \'em into the sea after a battle or two, even if they land, which I\r\ndon\'t believe they will.  We\'ve got ninety sail of the line, and though\r\nit is rather unfortunate that we should have declared war against Spain\r\nat this ticklish time, there\'s enough for all.\'  And Bob went into\r\nelaborate statistics of the navy, army, militia, and volunteers, to\r\nprolong the time of holding her.  When he had done speaking he drew\r\nrather a heavy sigh.\r\n\r\n\'What\'s the matter, Bob?\'\r\n\r\n\'I haven\'t been yet to offer myself as a sea-fencible, and I ought to\r\nhave done it long ago.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are only one.  Surely they can do without you?\'\r\n\r\nBob shook his head.  She arose from her restful position, her eye\r\ncatching his with a shamefaced expression of having given way at last.\r\nLoveday drew from his pocket a paper, and said, as they slowly walked on,\r\n\'Here\'s something to make us brave and patriotic.  I bought it in\r\nBudmouth.  Isn\'t it a stirring picture?\'\r\n\r\nIt was a hieroglyphic profile of Napoleon.  The hat represented a maimed\r\nFrench eagle; the face was ingeniously made up of human carcases, knotted\r\nand writhing together in such directions as to form a physiognomy; a\r\nband, or stock, shaped to resemble the English Channel, encircled his\r\nthroat, and seemed to choke him; his epaulette was a hand tearing a\r\ncobweb that represented the treaty of peace with England; and his ear was\r\na woman crouching over a dying child. {225}\r\n\r\n\'It is dreadful!\' said Anne.  \'I don\'t like to see it.\'\r\n\r\nShe had recovered from her emotion, and walked along beside him with a\r\ngrave, subdued face.  Bob did not like to assume the privileges of an\r\naccepted lover and draw her hand through his arm; for, conscious that she\r\nnaturally belonged to a politer grade than his own, he feared lest her\r\nexhibition of tenderness were an impulse which cooler moments might\r\nregret.  A perfect Paul-and-Virginia life had not absolutely set in for\r\nhim as yet, and it was not to be hastened by force.  When they had passed\r\nover the bridge into the mill-front they saw the miller standing at the\r\ndoor with a face of concern.\r\n\r\n\'Since you have been gone,\' he said, \'a Government man has been here, and\r\nto all the houses, taking down the numbers of the women and children, and\r\ntheir ages and the number of horses and waggons that can be mustered, in\r\ncase they have to retreat inland, out of the way of the invading army.\'\r\n\r\nThe little family gathered themselves together, all feeling the crisis\r\nmore seriously than they liked to express.  Mrs. Loveday thought how\r\nridiculous a thing social ambition was in such a conjuncture as this, and\r\nvowed that she would leave Anne to love where she would.  Anne, too,\r\nforgot the little peculiarities of speech and manner in Bob and his\r\nfather, which sometimes jarred for a moment upon her more refined sense,\r\nand was thankful for their love and protection in this looming trouble.\r\n\r\nOn going upstairs she remembered the paper which Farmer Derriman had\r\ngiven her, and searched in her bosom for it.  She could not find it\r\nthere.  \'I must have left it on the table,\' she said to herself.  It did\r\nnot matter; she remembered every word.  She took a pen and wrote a\r\nduplicate, which she put safely away.\r\n\r\nBut Anne was wrong.  She had, after all, placed the paper where she\r\nsupposed, and there it ought to have been.  But in escaping from Festus,\r\nwhen he feigned apoplexy, it had fallen out upon the grass.  Five minutes\r\nafter that event, when pursuer and pursued were two or three fields\r\nahead, the gaily-dressed woman whom the yeoman had overtaken, peeped\r\ncautiously through the stile into the corner of the field which had been\r\nthe scene of the scramble; and seeing the paper she climbed over, secured\r\nit, loosened the wafer without tearing the sheet, and read the memorandum\r\nwithin.  Unable to make anything of its meaning, the saunterer put it in\r\nher pocket, and, dismissing the matter from her mind, went on by the by-\r\npath which led to the back of the mill.  Here, behind the hedge, she\r\nstood and surveyed the old building for some time, after which she\r\nmeditatively turned, and retraced her steps towards the Royal watering-\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI.  THE ALARM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night which followed was historic and memorable.  Mrs. Loveday was\r\nawakened by the boom of a distant gun: she told the miller, and they\r\nlistened awhile.  The sound was not repeated, but such was the state of\r\ntheir feelings that Mr. Loveday went to Bob\'s room and asked if he had\r\nheard it.  Bob was wide awake, looking out of the window; he had heard\r\nthe ominous sound, and was inclined to investigate the matter.  While the\r\nfather and son were dressing they fancied that a glare seemed to be\r\nrising in the sky in the direction of the beacon hill.  Not wishing to\r\nalarm Anne and her mother, the miller assured them that Bob and himself\r\nwere merely going out of doors to inquire into the cause of the report,\r\nafter which they plunged into the gloom together.  A few steps\' progress\r\nopened up more of the sky, which, as they had thought, was indeed\r\nirradiated by a lurid light; but whether it came from the beacon or from\r\na more distant point they were unable to clearly tell.  They pushed on\r\nrapidly towards higher ground.\r\n\r\nTheir excitement was merely of a piece with that of all men at this\r\ncritical juncture.  Everywhere expectation was at fever heat.  For the\r\nlast year or two only five-and-twenty miles of shallow water had divided\r\nquiet English homesteads from an enemy\'s army of a hundred and fifty\r\nthousand men.  We had taken the matter lightly enough, eating and\r\ndrinking as in the days of Noe, and singing satires without end.  We\r\npunned on Buonaparte and his gunboats, chalked his effigy on\r\nstage-coaches, and published the same in prints.  Still, between these\r\nbursts of hilarity, it was sometimes recollected that England was the\r\nonly European country which had not succumbed to the mighty little man\r\nwho was less than human in feeling, and more than human in will; that our\r\nspirit for resistance was greater than our strength; and that the Channel\r\nwas often calm.  Boats built of wood which was greenly growing in its\r\nnative forest three days before it was bent as wales to their sides, were\r\nridiculous enough; but they might be, after all, sufficient for a single\r\ntrip between two visible shores.\r\n\r\nThe English watched Buonaparte in these preparations, and Buonaparte\r\nwatched the English.  At the distance of Boulogne details were lost, but\r\nwe were impressed on fine days by the novel sight of a huge army moving\r\nand twinkling like a school of mackerel under the rays of the sun.  The\r\nregular way of passing an afternoon in the coast towns was to stroll up\r\nto the signal posts and chat with the lieutenant on duty there about the\r\nlatest inimical object seen at sea.  About once a week there appeared in\r\nthe newspapers either a paragraph concerning some adventurous English\r\ngentleman who had sailed out in a pleasure-boat till he lay near enough\r\nto Boulogne to see Buonaparte standing on the heights among his marshals;\r\nor else some lines about a mysterious stranger with a foreign accent,\r\nwho, after collecting a vast deal of information on our resources, had\r\nhired a boat at a southern port, and vanished with it towards France\r\nbefore his intention could be divined.\r\n\r\nIn forecasting his grand venture, Buonaparte postulated the help of\r\nProvidence to a remarkable degree.  Just at the hour when his troops were\r\non board the flat-bottomed boats and ready to sail, there was to be a\r\ngreat fog, that should spread a vast obscurity over the length and\r\nbreadth of the Channel, and keep the English blind to events on the other\r\nside.  The fog was to last twenty-four hours, after which it might clear\r\naway.  A dead calm was to prevail simultaneously with the fog, with the\r\ntwofold object of affording the boats easy transit and dooming our ships\r\nto lie motionless.  Thirdly, there was to be a spring tide, which should\r\ncombine its manoeuvres with those of the fog and calm.\r\n\r\nAmong the many thousands of minor Englishmen whose lives were affected by\r\nthese tremendous designs may be numbered our old acquaintance Corporal\r\nTullidge, who sported the crushed arm, and poor old Simon Burden, the\r\ndazed veteran who had fought at Minden.  Instead of sitting snugly in the\r\nsettle of the Old Ship, in the village adjoining Overcombe, they were\r\nobliged to keep watch on the hill.  They made themselves as comfortable\r\nas was possible in the circumstances, dwelling in a hut of clods and\r\nturf, with a brick chimney for cooking.  Here they observed the nightly\r\nprogress of the moon and stars, grew familiar with the heaving of moles,\r\nthe dancing of rabbits on the hillocks, the distant hoot of owls, the\r\nbark of foxes from woods further inland; but saw not a sign of the enemy.\r\nAs, night after night, they walked round the two ricks which it was their\r\nduty to fire at a signal--one being of furze for a quick flame, the other\r\nof turf, for a long, slow radiance--they thought and talked of old times,\r\nand drank patriotically from a large wood flagon that was filled every\r\nday.\r\n\r\nBob and his father soon became aware that the light was from the beacon.\r\nBy the time that they reached the top it was one mass of towering flame,\r\nfrom which the sparks fell on the green herbage like a fiery dew; the\r\nforms of the two old men being seen passing and repassing in the midst of\r\nit.  The Lovedays, who came up on the smoky side, regarded the scene for\r\na moment, and then emerged into the light.\r\n\r\n\'Who goes there?\' said Corporal Tullidge, shouldering a pike with his\r\nsound arm.  \'O, \'tis neighbour Loveday!\'\r\n\r\n\'Did you get your signal to fire it from the east?\' said the miller\r\nhastily.\r\n\r\n\'No; from Abbotsea Beach.\'\r\n\r\n\'But you are not to go by a coast signal!\'\r\n\r\n\'Chok\' it all, wasn\'t the Lord-Lieutenant\'s direction, whenever you see\r\nRainbarrow\'s Beacon burn to the nor\'east\'ard, or Haggardon to the\r\nnor\'west\'ard, or the actual presence of the enemy on the shore?\'\r\n\r\n\'But is he here?\'\r\n\r\n\'No doubt o\'t!  The beach light is only just gone down, and Simon heard\r\nthe guns even better than I.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hark, hark!  I hear \'em!\' said Bob.\r\n\r\nThey listened with parted lips, the night wind blowing through Simon\r\nBurden\'s few teeth as through the ruins of Stonehenge.  From far down on\r\nthe lower levels came the noise of wheels and the tramp of horses upon\r\nthe turnpike road.\r\n\r\n\'Well, there must be something in it,\' said Miller Loveday gravely.  \'Bob,\r\nwe\'ll go home and make the women-folk safe, and then I\'ll don my\r\nsoldier\'s clothes and be off.  God knows where our company will\r\nassemble!\'\r\n\r\nThey hastened down the hill, and on getting into the road waited and\r\nlistened again.  Travellers began to come up and pass them in vehicles of\r\nall descriptions.  It was difficult to attract their attention in the dim\r\nlight, but by standing on the top of a wall which fenced the road Bob was\r\nat last seen.\r\n\r\n\'What\'s the matter?\' he cried to a butcher who was flying past in his\r\ncart, his wife sitting behind him without a bonnet.\r\n\r\n\'The French have landed!\' said the man, without drawing rein.\r\n\r\n\'Where?\' shouted Bob.\r\n\r\n\'In West Bay; and all Budmouth is in uproar!\' replied the voice, now\r\nfaint in the distance.\r\n\r\nBob and his father hastened on till they reached their own house.  As\r\nthey had expected, Anne and her mother, in common with most of the\r\npeople, were both dressed, and stood at the door bonneted and shawled,\r\nlistening to the traffic on the neighbouring highway, Mrs. Loveday having\r\nsecured what money and small valuables they possessed in a huge pocket\r\nwhich extended all round her waist, and added considerably to her weight\r\nand diameter.\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis true enough,\' said the miller: \'he\'s come!  You and Anne and the\r\nmaid must be off to Cousin Jim\'s at King\'s-Bere, and when you get there\r\nyou must do as they do.  I must assemble with the company.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I?\' said Bob.\r\n\r\n\'Thou\'st better run to the church, and take a pike before they be all\r\ngone.\'\r\n\r\nThe horse was put into the gig, and Mrs. Loveday, Anne, and the servant-\r\nmaid were hastily packed into the vehicle, the latter taking the reins;\r\nDavid\'s duties as a fighting-man forbidding all thought of his domestic\r\noffices now.  Then the silver tankard, teapot, pair of candlesticks like\r\nIonic columns, and other articles too large to be pocketed were thrown\r\ninto a basket and put up behind.  Then came the leave-taking, which was\r\nas sad as it was hurried.  Bob kissed Anne, and there was no affectation\r\nin her receiving that mark of affection as she said through her tears,\r\n\'God bless you!\'  At last they moved off in the dim light of dawn,\r\nneither of the three women knowing which road they were to take, but\r\ntrusting to chance to find it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were out of sight Bob went off for a pike, and his\r\nfather, first new-flinting his firelock, proceeded to don his uniform,\r\npipe-claying his breeches with such cursory haste as to bespatter his\r\nblack gaiters with the same ornamental compound.  Finding when he was\r\nready that no bugle had as yet sounded, he went with David to the cart-\r\nhouse, dragged out the waggon, and put therein some of the most useful\r\nand easily-handled goods, in case there might be an opportunity for\r\nconveying them away.  By the time this was done and the waggon pushed\r\nback and locked in, Bob had returned with his weapon, somewhat mortified\r\nat being doomed to this low form of defence.  The miller gave his son a\r\nparting grasp of the hand, and arranged to meet him at King\'s-Bere at the\r\nfirst opportunity if the news were true; if happily false, here at their\r\nown house.\r\n\r\n\'Bother it all!\' he exclaimed, looking at his stock of flints.\r\n\r\n\'What?\' said Bob.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve got no ammunition: not a blessed round!\'\r\n\r\n\'Then what\'s the use of going?\' asked his son.\r\n\r\nThe miller paused.  \'O, I\'ll go,\' he said.  \'Perhaps somebody will lend\r\nme a little if I get into a hot corner?\'\r\n\r\n\'Lend ye a little!  Father, you was always so simple!\' said Bob\r\nreproachfully.\r\n\r\n\'Well--I can bagnet a few, anyhow,\' said the miller.\r\n\r\nThe bugle had been blown ere this, and Loveday the father disappeared\r\ntowards the place of assembly, his empty cartridge-box behind him.  Bob\r\nseized a brace of loaded pistols which he had brought home from the ship,\r\nand, armed with these and a pike, he locked the door and sallied out\r\nagain towards the turnpike road.\r\n\r\nBy this time the yeomanry of the district were also on the move, and\r\namong them Festus Derriman, who was sleeping at his uncle\'s, and had been\r\nawakened by Cripplestraw.  About the time when Bob and his father were\r\ndescending from the beacon the stalwart yeoman was standing in the stable-\r\nyard adjusting his straps, while Cripplestraw saddled the horse.  Festus\r\nclanked up and down, looked gloomily at the beacon, heard the retreating\r\ncarts and carriages, and called Cripplestraw to him, who came from the\r\nstable leading the horse at the same moment that Uncle Benjy peeped\r\nunobserved from a mullioned window above their heads, the distant light\r\nof the beacon fire touching up his features to the complexion of an old\r\nbrass clock-face.\r\n\r\n\'I think that before I start, Cripplestraw,\' said Festus, whose lurid\r\nvisage was undergoing a bleaching process curious to look upon, \'you\r\nshall go on to Budmouth, and make a bold inquiry whether the cowardly\r\nenemy is on shore as yet, or only looming in the bay.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'d go in a moment, sir,\' said the other, \'if I hadn\'t my bad leg again.\r\nI should have joined my company afore this; but they said at last drill\r\nthat I was too old.  So I shall wait up in the hay-loft for tidings as\r\nsoon as I have packed you off, poor gentleman!\'\r\n\r\n\'Do such alarms as these, Cripplestraw, ever happen without foundation?\r\nBuonaparte is a wretch, a miserable wretch, and this may be only a false\r\nalarm to disappoint such as me?\'\r\n\r\n\'O no, sir; O no!\'\r\n\r\n\'But sometimes there are false alarms?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, sir, yes.  There was a pretended sally o\' gunboats last year.\'\r\n\r\n\'And was there nothing else pretended--something more like this, for\r\ninstance?\'\r\n\r\nCripplestraw shook his head.  \'I notice yer modesty, Mr. Festus, in\r\nmaking light of things.  But there never was, sir.  You may depend upon\r\nit he\'s come.  Thank God, my duty as a Local don\'t require me to go to\r\nthe front, but only the valiant men like my master.  Ah, if Boney could\r\nonly see \'ee now, sir, he\'d know too well there is nothing to be got from\r\nsuch a determined skilful officer but blows and musket-balls!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes.  Cripplestraw, if I ride off to Budmouth and meet \'em, all my\r\ntraining will be lost.  No skill is required as a forlorn hope.\'\r\n\r\n\'True; that\'s a point, sir.  You would outshine \'em all, and be picked\r\noff at the very beginning as a too-dangerous brave man.\'\r\n\r\n\'But if I stay here and urge on the faint-hearted ones, or get up into\r\nthe turret-stair by that gateway, and pop at the invaders through the\r\nloophole, I shouldn\'t be so completely wasted, should I?\'\r\n\r\n\'You would not, Mr. Derriman.  But, as you was going to say next, the\r\nfire in yer veins won\'t let ye do that.  You are valiant; very good: you\r\ndon\'t want to husband yer valiance at home.  The arg\'ment is plain.\'\r\n\r\n\'If my birth had been more obscure,\' murmured the yeoman, \'and I had only\r\nbeen in the militia, for instance, or among the humble pikemen, so much\r\nwouldn\'t have been expected of me--of my fiery nature.  Cripplestraw, is\r\nthere a drop of brandy to be got at in the house?  I don\'t feel very\r\nwell.\'\r\n\r\n\'Dear nephew,\' said the old gentleman from above, whom neither of the\r\nothers had as yet noticed, \'I haven\'t any spirits opened--so unfortunate!\r\nBut there\'s a beautiful barrel of crab-apple cider in draught; and\r\nthere\'s some cold tea from last night.\'\r\n\r\n\'What, is he listening?\' said Festus, staring up.  \'Now I warrant how\r\nglad he is to see me forced to go--called out of bed without breakfast,\r\nand he quite safe, and sure to escape because he\'s an old\r\nman!--Cripplestraw, I like being in the yeomanry cavalry; but I wish I\r\nhadn\'t been in the ranks; I wish I had been only the surgeon, to stay in\r\nthe rear while the bodies are brought back to him--I mean, I should have\r\nthrown my heart at such a time as this more into the labour of restoring\r\nwounded men and joining their shattered limbs together--u-u-ugh!--more\r\nthan I can into causing the wounds--I am too humane, Cripplestraw, for\r\nthe ranks!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes,\' said his companion, depressing his spirits to a kindred\r\nlevel.  \'And yet, such is fate, that, instead of joining men\'s limbs\r\ntogether, you\'ll have to get your own joined--poor young sojer!--all\r\nthrough having such a warlike soul.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' murmured Festus, and paused.  \'You can\'t think how strange I feel\r\nhere, Cripplestraw,\' he continued, laying his hand upon the centre\r\nbuttons of his waistcoat.  \'How I do wish I was only the surgeon!\'\r\n\r\nHe slowly mounted, and Uncle Benjy, in the meantime, sang to himself as\r\nhe looked on, \'_Twen-ty-three and half from N.W._  _Six-teen and three-\r\nquar-ters from N.E._\'\r\n\r\n\'What\'s that old mummy singing?\' said Festus savagely.\r\n\r\n\'Only a hymn for preservation from our enemies, dear nephew,\' meekly\r\nreplied the farmer, who had heard the remark.  \'_Twen-ty-three and half\r\nfrom N.W_.\'\r\n\r\nFestus allowed his horse to move on a few paces, and then turned again,\r\nas if struck by a happy invention.  \'Cripplestraw,\' he began, with an\r\nartificial laugh, \'I am obliged to confess, after all--I must see her!\r\n\'Tisn\'t nature that makes me draw back--\'tis love.  I must go and look\r\nfor her.\'\r\n\r\n\'A woman, sir?\'\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t want to confess it; but \'tis a woman.  Strange that I should be\r\ndrawn so entirely against my natural wish to rush at \'em!\'\r\n\r\nCripplestraw, seeing which way the wind blew, found it advisable to blow\r\nin harmony.  \'Ah, now at last I see, sir!  Spite that few men live that\r\nbe worthy to command ye; spite that you could rush on, marshal the troops\r\nto victory, as I may say; but then--what of it? there\'s the unhappy fate\r\nof being smit with the eyes of a woman, and you are unmanned!  Maister\r\nDerriman, who is himself, when he\'s got a woman round his neck like a\r\nmillstone?\'\r\n\r\n\'It is something like that.\'\r\n\r\n\'I feel the case.  Be you valiant?--I know, of course, the words being a\r\nmatter of form--be you valiant, I ask?  Yes, of course.  Then don\'t you\r\nwaste it in the open field.  Hoard it up, I say, sir, for a higher class\r\nof war--the defence of yer adorable lady.  Think what you owe her at this\r\nterrible time!  Now, Maister Derriman, once more I ask ye to cast off\r\nthat first haughty wish to rush to Budmouth, and to go where your mis\'ess\r\nis defenceless and alone.\'\r\n\r\n\'I will, Cripplestraw, now you put it like that!\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank ye, thank ye heartily, Maister Derriman.  Go now and hide with\r\nher.\'\r\n\r\n\'But can I?  Now, hang flattery!--can a man hide without a stain?  Of\r\ncourse I would not hide in any mean sense; no, not I!\'\r\n\r\n\'If you be in love, \'tis plain you may, since it is not your own life,\r\nbut another\'s, that you are concerned for, and you only save your own\r\nbecause it can\'t be helped.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis true, Cripplestraw, in a sense.  But will it be understood that\r\nway?  Will they see it as a brave hiding?\'\r\n\r\n\'Now, sir, if you had not been in love I own to ye that hiding would look\r\nqueer, but being to save the tears, groans, fits, swowndings, and perhaps\r\ndeath of a comely young woman, yer principle is good; you honourably\r\nretreat because you be too gallant to advance.  This sounds strange, ye\r\nmay say, sir; but it is plain enough to less fiery minds.\'\r\n\r\nFestus did for a moment try to uncover his teeth in a natural smile, but\r\nit died away.  \'Cripplestraw, you flatter me; or do you mean it?  Well,\r\nthere\'s truth in it.  I am more gallant in going to her than in marching\r\nto the shore.  But we cannot be too careful about our good names, we\r\nsoldiers.  I must not be seen.  I\'m off.\'\r\n\r\nCripplestraw opened the hurdle which closed the arch under the portico\r\ngateway, and Festus passed under, Uncle Benjamin singing, _Twen-ty-three\r\nand a half from N.W._ with a sort of sublime ecstasy, feeling, as Festus\r\nhad observed, that his money was safe, and that the French would not\r\npersonally molest an old man in such a ragged, mildewed coat as that he\r\nwore, which he had taken the precaution to borrow from a scarecrow in one\r\nof his fields for the purpose.\r\n\r\nFestus rode on full of his intention to seek out Anne, and under cover of\r\nprotecting her retreat accompany her to King\'s-Bere, where he knew the\r\nLovedays had relatives.  In the lane he met Granny Seamore, who, having\r\npacked up all her possessions in a small basket, was placidly retreating\r\nto the mountains till all should be over.\r\n\r\n\'Well, granny, have ye seen the French?\' asked Festus.\r\n\r\n\'No,\' she said, looking up at him through her brazen spectacles.  \'If I\r\nhad I shouldn\'t ha\' seed thee!\'\r\n\r\n\'Faugh!\' replied the yeoman, and rode on.  Just as he reached the old\r\nroad, which he had intended merely to cross and avoid, his countenance\r\nfell.  Some troops of regulars, who appeared to be dragoons, were\r\nrattling along the road.  Festus hastened towards an opposite gate, so as\r\nto get within the field before they should see him; but, as ill-luck\r\nwould have it, as soon as he got inside, a party of six or seven of his\r\nown yeomanry troop were straggling across the same field and making for\r\nthe spot where he was.  The dragoons passed without seeing him; but when\r\nhe turned out into the road again it was impossible to retreat towards\r\nOvercombe village because of the yeomen.  So he rode straight on, and\r\nheard them coming at his heels.  There was no other gate, and the highway\r\nsoon became as straight as a bowstring.  Unable thus to turn without\r\nmeeting them, and caught like an eel in a water-pipe, Festus drew nearer\r\nand nearer to the fateful shore.  But he did not relinquish hope.  Just\r\nahead there were cross-roads, and he might have a chance of slipping down\r\none of them without being seen.  On reaching the spot he found that he\r\nwas not alone.  A horseman had come up the right-hand lane and drawn\r\nrein.  It was an officer of the German legion, and seeing Festus he held\r\nup his hand.  Festus rode up to him and saluted.\r\n\r\n\'It ist false report!\' said the officer.\r\n\r\nFestus was a man again.  He felt that nothing was too much for him.  The\r\nofficer, after some explanation of the cause of alarm, said that he was\r\ngoing across to the road which led by the moor, to stop the troops and\r\nvolunteers converging from that direction, upon which Festus offered to\r\ngive information along the Casterbridge road.  The German crossed over,\r\nand was soon out of sight in the lane, while Festus turned back upon the\r\nway by which he had come.  The party of yeomanry cavalry was rapidly\r\ndrawing near, and he soon recognized among them the excited voices of\r\nStubb of Duddle Hole, Noakes of Muckleford, and other comrades of his\r\norgies at the hall.  It was a magnificent opportunity, and Festus drew\r\nhis sword.  When they were within speaking distance he reined round his\r\ncharger\'s head to Budmouth and shouted, \'On, comrades, on!  I am waiting\r\nfor you.  You have been a long time getting up with me, seeing the\r\nglorious nature of our deeds to-day!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well said, Derriman, well said!\' replied the foremost of the riders.\r\n\'Have you heard anything new?\'\r\n\r\n\'Only that he\'s here with his tens of thousands, and that we are to ride\r\nto meet him sword in hand as soon as we have assembled in the town ahead\r\nhere.\'\r\n\r\n\'O Lord!\' said Noakes, with a slight falling of the lower jaw.\r\n\r\n\'The man who quails now is unworthy of the name of yeoman,\' said Festus,\r\nstill keeping ahead of the other troopers and holding up his sword to the\r\nsun.  \'O Noakes, fie, fie!  You begin to look pale, man.\'\r\n\r\n\'Faith, perhaps you\'d look pale,\' said Noakes, with an envious glance\r\nupon Festus\'s daring manner, \'if you had a wife and family depending upon\r\nye!\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll take three frog-eating Frenchmen single-handed!\' rejoined Derriman,\r\nstill flourishing his sword.\r\n\r\n\'They have as good swords as you; as you will soon find,\' said another of\r\nthe yeomen.\r\n\r\n\'If they were three times armed,\' said Festus--\'ay, thrice three times--I\r\nwould attempt \'em three to one.  How do you feel now, my old friend\r\nStubb?\' (turning to another of the warriors.)  \'O, friend Stubb! no\r\nbouncing health to our lady-loves in Oxwell Hall this summer as last.  Eh,\r\nBrownjohn?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am afraid not,\' said Brownjohn gloomily.\r\n\r\n\'No rattling dinners at Stacie\'s Hotel, and the King below with his\r\nstaff.  No wrenching off door-knockers and sending \'em to the bakehouse\r\nin a pie that nobody calls for.  Weeks of cut-and-thrust work rather!\'\r\n\r\n\'I suppose so.\'\r\n\r\n\'Fight how we may we shan\'t get rid of the cursed tyrant before autumn,\r\nand many thousand brave men will lie low before it\'s done,\' remarked a\r\nyoung yeoman with a calm face, who meant to do his duty without much\r\ntalking.\r\n\r\n\'No grinning matches at Mai-dun Castle this summer,\' Festus resumed; \'no\r\nthread-the-needle at Greenhill Fair, and going into shows and driving the\r\nshowman crazy with cock-a-doodle-doo!\'\r\n\r\n\'I suppose not.\'\r\n\r\n\'Does it make you seem just a trifle uncomfortable, Noakes?  Keep up your\r\nspirits, old comrade.  Come, forward! we are only ambling on like so many\r\ndonkey-women.  We have to get into Budmouth, join the rest of the troop,\r\nand then march along the coast west\'ard, as I imagine.  At this rate we\r\nshan\'t be well into the thick of battle before twelve o\'clock.  Spur on,\r\ncomrades.  No dancing on the green, Lockham, this year in the moonlight!\r\nYou was tender upon that girl; gad, what will become o\' her in the\r\nstruggle?\'\r\n\r\n\'Come, come, Derriman,\' expostulated Lockham--\'this is all very well, but\r\nI don\'t care for \'t.  I am as ready to fight as any man, but--\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps when you get into battle, Derriman, and see what it\'s like, your\r\ncourage will cool down a little,\' added Noakes on the same side, but with\r\nsecret admiration of Festus\'s reckless bravery.\r\n\r\n\'I shall be bayoneted first,\' said Festus.  \'Now let\'s rally, and on!\'\r\n\r\nSince Festus was determined to spur on wildly, the rest of the yeomen did\r\nnot like to seem behindhand, and they rapidly approached the town.  Had\r\nthey been calm enough to reflect, they might have observed that for the\r\nlast half-hour no carts or carriages had met them on the way, as they had\r\ndone further back.  It was not till the troopers reached the turnpike\r\nthat they learnt what Festus had known a quarter of an hour before.  At\r\nthe intelligence Derriman sheathed his sword with a sigh; and the party\r\nsoon fell in with comrades who had arrived there before them, whereupon\r\nthe source and details of the alarm were boisterously discussed.\r\n\r\n\'What, didn\'t you know of the mistake till now?\' asked one of these of\r\nthe new-comers.  \'Why, when I was dropping over the hill by the cross-\r\nroads I looked back and saw that man talking to the messenger, and he\r\nmust have told him the truth.\'  The speaker pointed to Festus.  They\r\nturned their indignant eyes full upon him.  That he had sported with\r\ntheir deepest feelings, while knowing the rumour to be baseless, was soon\r\napparent to all.\r\n\r\n\'Beat him black and blue with the flat of our blades!\' shouted two or\r\nthree, turning their horses\' heads to drop back upon Derriman, in which\r\nmove they were followed by most of the party.\r\n\r\nBut Festus, foreseeing danger from the unexpected revelation, had already\r\njudiciously placed a few intervening yards between himself and his fellow-\r\nyeomen, and now, clapping spurs to his horse, rattled like thunder and\r\nlightning up the road homeward.  His ready flight added hotness to their\r\npursuit, and as he rode and looked fearfully over his shoulder he could\r\nsee them following with enraged faces and drawn swords, a position which\r\nthey kept up for a distance of more than a mile.  Then he had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing them drop off one by one, and soon he and his\r\npanting charger remained alone on the highway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII.  DANGER TO ANNE\r\n\r\n\r\nHe stopped and reflected how to turn this rebuff to advantage.  Baulked\r\nin his project of entering the watering-place and enjoying\r\ncongratulations upon his patriotic bearing during the advance, he sulkily\r\nconsidered that he might be able to make some use of his enforced\r\nretirement by riding to Overcombe and glorifying himself in the eyes of\r\nMiss Garland before the truth should have reached that hamlet.  Having\r\nthus decided he spurred on in a better mood.\r\n\r\nBy this time the volunteers were on the march, and as Derriman ascended\r\nthe road he met the Overcombe company, in which trudged Miller Loveday\r\nshoulder to shoulder with the other substantial householders of the place\r\nand its neighbourhood, duly equipped with pouches, cross-belts,\r\nfirelocks, flint-boxes, pickers, worms, magazines, priming-horns, heel-\r\nball, and pomatum.  There was nothing to be gained by further suppression\r\nof the truth, and briefly informing them that the danger was not so\r\nimmediate as had been supposed, Festus galloped on.  At the end of\r\nanother mile he met a large number of pikemen, including Bob Loveday,\r\nwhom the yeoman resolved to sound upon the whereabouts of Anne.  The\r\ncircumstances were such as to lead Bob to speak more frankly than he\r\nmight have done on reflection, and he told Festus the direction in which\r\nthe women had been sent.  Then Festus informed the group that the report\r\nof invasion was false, upon which they all turned to go homeward with\r\ngreatly relieved spirits.\r\n\r\nBob walked beside Derriman\'s horse for some distance.  Loveday had\r\ninstantly made up his mind to go and look for the women, and ease their\r\nanxiety by letting them know the good news as soon as possible.  But he\r\nsaid nothing of this to Festus during their return together; nor did\r\nFestus tell Bob that he also had resolved to seek them out, and by\r\nanticipating every one else in that enterprise, make of it a glorious\r\nopportunity for bringing Miss Garland to her senses about him.  He still\r\nresented the ducking that he had received at her hands, and was not\r\ndisposed to let that insult pass without obtaining some sort of sweet\r\nrevenge.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had parted Festus cantered on over the hill, meeting on\r\nhis way the Longpuddle volunteers, sixty rank and file, under Captain\r\nCunningham; the Casterbridge company, ninety strong (known as the\r\n\'Consideration Company\' in those days), under Captain Strickland; and\r\nothers--all with anxious faces and covered with dust.  Just passing the\r\nword to them and leaving them at halt, he proceeded rapidly onward in the\r\ndirection of King\'s-Bere.  Nobody appeared on the road for some time,\r\ntill after a ride of several miles he met a stray corporal of volunteers,\r\nwho told Festus in answer to his inquiry that he had certainly passed no\r\ngig full of women of the kind described.  Believing that he had missed\r\nthem by following the highway, Derriman turned back into a lane along\r\nwhich they might have chosen to journey for privacy\'s sake,\r\nnotwithstanding the badness and uncertainty of its track.  Arriving again\r\nwithin five miles of Overcombe, he at length heard tidings of the\r\nwandering vehicle and its precious burden, which, like the Ark when sent\r\naway from the country of the Philistines, had apparently been left to the\r\ninstincts of the beast that drew it.  A labouring man, just at daybreak,\r\nhad seen the helpless party going slowly up a distant drive, which he\r\npointed out.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Festus parted from this informant than he beheld Bob\r\napproaching, mounted on the miller\'s second and heavier horse.  Bob\r\nlooked rather surprised, and Festus felt his coming glory in danger.\r\n\r\n\'They went down that lane,\' he said, signifying precisely the opposite\r\ndirection to the true one.  \'I, too, have been on the look-out for\r\nmissing friends.\'\r\n\r\nAs Festus was riding back there was no reason to doubt his information,\r\nand Loveday rode on as misdirected.  Immediately that he was out of sight\r\nFestus reversed his course, and followed the track which Anne and her\r\ncompanions were last seen to pursue.\r\n\r\nThis road had been ascended by the gig in question nearly two hours\r\nbefore the present moment.  Molly, the servant, held the reins, Mrs.\r\nLoveday sat beside her, and Anne behind.  Their progress was but slow,\r\nowing partly to Molly\'s want of skill, and partly to the steepness of the\r\nroad, which here passed over downs of some extent, and was rarely or\r\nnever mended.  It was an anxious morning for them all, and the beauties\r\nof the early summer day fell upon unheeding eyes.  They were too anxious\r\neven for conjecture, and each sat thinking her own thoughts, occasionally\r\nglancing westward, or stopping the horse to listen to sounds from more\r\nfrequented roads along which other parties were retreating.  Once, while\r\nthey listened and gazed thus, they saw a glittering in the distance, and\r\nheard the tramp of many horses.  It was a large body of cavalry going in\r\nthe direction of the King\'s watering-place, the same regiment of\r\ndragoons, in fact, which Festus had seen further on in its course.  The\r\nwomen in the gig had no doubt that these men were marching at once to\r\nengage the enemy.  By way of varying the monotony of the journey Molly\r\noccasionally burst into tears of horror, believing Buonaparte to be in\r\ncountenance and habits precisely what the caricatures represented him.\r\nMrs. Loveday endeavoured to establish cheerfulness by assuring her\r\ncompanions of the natural civility of the French nation, with whom\r\nunprotected women were safe from injury, unless through the casual\r\nexcesses of soldiery beyond control.  This was poor consolation to Anne,\r\nwhose mind was more occupied with Bob than with herself, and a miserable\r\nfear that she would never again see him alive so paled her face and\r\nsaddened her gaze forward, that at last her mother said, \'Who was you\r\nthinking of, my dear?\'  Anne\'s only reply was a look at her mother, with\r\nwhich a tear mingled.\r\n\r\nMolly whipped the horse, by which she quickened his pace for five yards,\r\nwhen he again fell into the perverse slowness that showed how fully\r\nconscious he was of being the master-mind and chief personage of the\r\nfour.  Whenever there was a pool of water by the road he turned aside to\r\ndrink a mouthful, and remained there his own time in spite of Molly\'s tug\r\nat the reins and futile fly-flapping on his rump.  They were now in the\r\nchalk district, where there were no hedges, and a rough attempt at\r\nmending the way had been made by throwing down huge lumps of that glaring\r\nmaterial in heaps, without troubling to spread it or break them abroad.\r\nThe jolting here was most distressing, and seemed about to snap the\r\nsprings.\r\n\r\n\'How that wheel do wamble,\' said Molly at last.  She had scarcely spoken\r\nwhen the wheel came off, and all three were precipitated over it into the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nFortunately the horse stood still, and they began to gather themselves\r\nup.  The only one of the three who had suffered in the least from the\r\nfall was Anne, and she was only conscious of a severe shaking which had\r\nhalf stupefied her for the time.  The wheel lay flat in the road, so that\r\nthere was no possibility of driving further in their present plight.  They\r\nlooked around for help.  The only friendly object near was a lonely\r\ncottage, from its situation evidently the home of a shepherd.\r\n\r\nThe horse was unharnessed and tied to the back of the gig, and the three\r\nwomen went across to the house.  On getting close they found that the\r\nshutters of all the lower windows were closed, but on trying the door it\r\nopened to the hand.  Nobody was within; the house appeared to have been\r\nabandoned in some confusion, and the probability was that the shepherd\r\nhad fled on hearing the alarm.  Anne now said that she felt the effects\r\nof her fall too severely to be able to go any further just then, and it\r\nwas agreed that she should be left there while Mrs. Loveday and Molly\r\nwent on for assistance, the elder lady deeming Molly too young and vacant-\r\nminded to be trusted to go alone.  Molly suggested taking the horse, as\r\nthe distance might be great, each of them sitting alternately on his back\r\nwhile the other led him by the head.  This they did, Anne watching them\r\nvanish down the white and lumpy road.\r\n\r\nShe then looked round the room, as well as she could do so by the light\r\nfrom the open door.  It was plain, from the shutters being closed, that\r\nthe shepherd had left his house before daylight, the candle and\r\nextinguisher on the table pointing to the same conclusion.  Here she\r\nremained, her eyes occasionally sweeping the bare, sunny expanse of down,\r\nthat was only relieved from absolute emptiness by the overturned gig hard\r\nby.  The sheep seemed to have gone away, and scarcely a bird flew across\r\nto disturb the solitude.  Anne had risen early that morning, and leaning\r\nback in the withy chair, which she had placed by the door, she soon fell\r\ninto an uneasy doze, from which she was awakened by the distant tramp of\r\na horse.  Feeling much recovered from the effects of the overturn, she\r\neagerly rose and looked out.  The horse was not Miller Loveday\'s, but a\r\npowerful bay, bearing a man in full yeomanry uniform.\r\n\r\nAnne did not wait to recognize further; instantly re-entering the house,\r\nshe shut the door and bolted it.  In the dark she sat and listened: not a\r\nsound.  At the end of ten minutes, thinking that the rider if he were not\r\nFestus had carelessly passed by, or that if he were Festus he had not\r\nseen her, she crept softly upstairs and peeped out of the window.\r\nExcepting the spot of shade, formed by the gig as before, the down was\r\nquite bare.  She then opened the casement and stretched out her neck.\r\n\r\n\'Ha, young madam!  There you are!  I knew \'ee!  Now you are caught!\' came\r\nlike a clap of thunder from a point three or four feet beneath her, and\r\nturning down her frightened eyes she beheld Festus Derriman lurking close\r\nto the wall.  His attention had first been attracted by her shutting the\r\ndoor of the cottage; then by the overturned gig; and after making sure,\r\nby examining the vehicle, that he was not mistaken in her identity, he\r\nhad dismounted, led his horse round to the side, and crept up to entrap\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAnne started back into the room, and remained still as a stone.  Festus\r\nwent on--\'Come, you must trust to me.  The French have landed.  I have\r\nbeen trying to meet with you every hour since that confounded trick you\r\nplayed me.  You threw me into the water.  Faith, it was well for you I\r\ndidn\'t catch ye then!  I should have taken a revenge in a better way than\r\nI shall now.  I mean to have that kiss of ye.  Come, Miss Nancy; do you\r\nhear?--\'Tis no use for you to lurk inside there.  You\'ll have to turn out\r\nas soon as Boney comes over the hill--Are you going to open the door, I\r\nsay, and speak to me in a civil way?  What do you think I am, then, that\r\nyou should barricade yourself against me as if I was a wild beast or\r\nFrenchman?  Open the door, or put out your head, or do something; or \'pon\r\nmy soul I\'ll break in the door!\'\r\n\r\nIt occurred to Anne at this point of the tirade that the best policy\r\nwould be to temporize till somebody should return, and she put out her\r\nhead and face, now grown somewhat pale.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s better,\' said Festus.  \'Now I can talk to you.  Come, my dear,\r\nwill you open the door?  Why should you be afraid of me?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am not altogether afraid of you; I am safe from the French here,\' said\r\nAnne, not very truthfully, and anxiously casting her eyes over the vacant\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\'Then let me tell you that the alarm is false, and that no landing has\r\nbeen attempted.  Now will you open the door and let me in?  I am tired.  I\r\nhave been on horseback ever since daylight, and have come to bring you\r\nthe good tidings.\'\r\n\r\nAnne looked as if she doubted the news.\r\n\r\n\'Come,\' said Festus.\r\n\r\n\'No, I cannot let you in,\' she murmured, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\'Dash my wig, then,\' he cried, his face flaming up, \'I\'ll find a way to\r\nget in!  Now, don\'t you provoke me!  You don\'t know what I am capable of.\r\nI ask you again, will you open the door?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why do you wish it?\' she said faintly.\r\n\r\n\'I have told you I want to sit down; and I want to ask you a question.\'\r\n\r\n\'You can ask me from where you are.\'\r\n\r\n\'I cannot ask you properly.  It is about a serious matter: whether you\r\nwill accept my heart and hand.  I am not going to throw myself at your\r\nfeet; but I ask you to do your duty as a woman, namely, give your solemn\r\nword to take my name as soon as the war is over and I have time to attend\r\nto you.  I scorn to ask it of a haughty hussy who will only speak to me\r\nthrough a window; however, I put it to you for the last time, madam.\'\r\n\r\nThere was no sign on the down of anybody\'s return, and she said, \'I\'ll\r\nthink of it, sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'You have thought of it long enough; I want to know.  Will you or won\'t\r\nyou?\'\r\n\r\n\'Very well; I think I will.\'  And then she felt that she might be buying\r\npersonal safety too dearly by shuffling thus, since he would spread the\r\nreport that she had accepted him, and cause endless complication.  \'No,\'\r\nshe said, \'I have changed my mind.  I cannot accept you, Mr. Derriman.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s how you play with me!\' he exclaimed, stamping.  \'"Yes," one\r\nmoment; "No," the next.  Come, you don\'t know what you refuse.  That old\r\nhall is my uncle\'s own, and he has nobody else to leave it to.  As soon\r\nas he\'s dead I shall throw up farming and start as a squire.  And now,\'\r\nhe added with a bitter sneer, \'what a fool you are to hang back from such\r\na chance!\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, I don\'t value it,\' said Anne.\r\n\r\n\'Because you hate him who would make it yours?\'\r\n\r\n\'It may not lie in your power to do that.\'\r\n\r\n\'What--has the old fellow been telling you his affairs?\'\r\n\r\n\'No.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then why do you mistrust me?  Now, after this will you open the door,\r\nand show that you treat me as a friend if you won\'t accept me as a lover?\r\nI only want to sit and talk to you.\'\r\n\r\nAnne thought she would trust him; it seemed almost impossible that he\r\ncould harm her.  She retired from the window and went downstairs.  When\r\nher hand was upon the bolt of the door, her mind misgave her.  Instead of\r\nwithdrawing it she remained in silence where she was, and he began again--\r\n\r\n\'Are you going to unfasten it?\'\r\n\r\nAnne did not speak.\r\n\r\n\'Now, dash my wig, I will get at you!  You\'ve tried me beyond endurance.\r\nOne kiss would have been enough that day in the mead; now I\'ll have\r\nforty, whether you will or no!\'\r\n\r\nHe flung himself against the door; but as it was bolted, and had in\r\naddition a great wooden bar across it, this produced no effect.  He was\r\nsilent for a moment, and then the terrified girl heard him attempt the\r\nshuttered window.  She ran upstairs and again scanned the down.  The\r\nyellow gig still lay in the blazing sunshine, and the horse of Festus\r\nstood by the corner of the garden--nothing else was to be seen.  At this\r\nmoment there came to her ear the noise of a sword drawn from its\r\nscabbard; and, peeping over the window-sill, she saw her tormentor drive\r\nhis sword between the joints of the shutters, in an attempt to rip them\r\nopen.  The sword snapped off in his hand.  With an imprecation he pulled\r\nout the piece, and returned the two halves to the scabbard.\r\n\r\n\'Ha! ha!\' he cried, catching sight of the top of her head.  \'\'Tis only a\r\njoke, you know; but I\'ll get in all the same.  All for a kiss!  But never\r\nmind, we\'ll do it yet!\'  He spoke in an affectedly light tone, as if\r\nashamed of his previous resentful temper; but she could see by the livid\r\nback of his neck that he was brimful of suppressed passion.  \'Only a\r\njest, you know,\' he went on.  \'How are we going to do it now?  Why, in\r\nthis way.  I go and get a ladder, and enter at the upper window where my\r\nlove is.  And there\'s the ladder lying under that corn-rick in the first\r\nenclosed field.  Back in two minutes, dear!\'\r\n\r\nHe ran off, and was lost to her view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII.  ANNE DOES WONDERS\r\n\r\n\r\nAnne fearfully surveyed her position.  The upper windows of the cottage\r\nwere of flimsiest lead-work, and to keep him out would be hopeless.  She\r\nfelt that not a moment was to be lost in getting away.  Running\r\ndownstairs she opened the door, and then it occurred to her terrified\r\nunderstanding that there would be no chance of escaping him by flight\r\nafoot across such an extensive down, since he might mount his horse and\r\neasily ride after her.  The animal still remained tethered at the corner\r\nof the garden; if she could release him and frighten him away before\r\nFestus returned, there would not be quite such odds against her.  She\r\naccordingly unhooked the horse by reaching over the bank, and then,\r\npulling off her muslin neckerchief, flapped it in his eyes to startle\r\nhim.  But the gallant steed did not move or flinch; she tried again, and\r\nhe seemed rather pleased than otherwise.  At this moment she heard a cry\r\nfrom the cottage, and turning, beheld her adversary approaching round the\r\ncorner of the building.\r\n\r\n\'I thought I should tole out the mouse by that trick!\' cried Festus\r\nexultingly.  Instead of going for a ladder, he had simply hidden himself\r\nat the back to tempt her down.\r\n\r\nPoor Anne was now desperate.  The bank on which she stood was level with\r\nthe horse\'s back, and the creature seemed quiet as a lamb.  With a\r\ndetermination of which she was capable in emergencies, she seized the\r\nrein, flung herself upon the sheepskin, and held on by the mane.  The\r\namazed charger lifted his head, sniffed, wrenched his ears hither and\r\nthither, and started off at a frightful speed across the down.\r\n\r\n\'O, my heart and limbs!\' said Festus under his breath, as, thoroughly\r\nalarmed, he gazed after her.  \'She on Champion!  She\'ll break her neck,\r\nand I shall be tried for manslaughter, and disgrace will be brought upon\r\nthe name of Derriman!\'\r\n\r\nChampion continued to go at a stretch-gallop, but he did nothing worse.\r\nHad he plunged or reared, Derriman\'s fears might have been verified, and\r\nAnne have come with deadly force to the ground.  But the course was good,\r\nand in the horse\'s speed lay a comparative security.  She was scarcely\r\nshaken in her precarious half-horizontal position, though she was awed to\r\nsee the grass, loose stones, and other objects pass her eyes like strokes\r\nwhenever she opened them, which was only just for a second at intervals\r\nof half a minute; and to feel how wildly the stirrups swung, and that\r\nwhat struck her knee was the bucket of the carbine, and that it was a\r\npistol-holster which hurt her arm.\r\n\r\nThey quickly cleared the down, and Anne became conscious that the course\r\nof the horse was homeward.  As soon as the ground began to rise towards\r\nthe outer belt of upland which lay between her and the coast, Champion,\r\nnow panting and reeking with moisture, lessened his speed in sheer\r\nweariness, and proceeded at a rapid jolting trot.  Anne felt that she\r\ncould not hold on half so well; the gallop had been child\'s play compared\r\nwith this.  They were in a lane, ascending to a ridge, and she made up\r\nher mind for a fall.  Over the ridge rose an animated spot, higher and\r\nhigher; it turned out to be the upper part of a man, and the man to be a\r\nsoldier.  Such was Anne\'s attitude that she only got an occasional\r\nglimpse of him; and, though she feared that he might be a Frenchman, she\r\nfeared the horse more than the enemy, as she had feared Festus more than\r\nthe horse.  Anne had energy enough left to cry, \'Stop him; stop him!\' as\r\nthe soldier drew near.\r\n\r\nHe, astonished at the sight of a military horse with a bundle of drapery\r\nacross his back, had already placed himself in the middle of the lane,\r\nand he now held out his arms till his figure assumed the form of a Latin\r\ncross planted in the roadway.  Champion drew near, swerved, and stood\r\nstill almost suddenly, a check sufficient to send Anne slipping down his\r\nflank to the ground.  The timely friend stepped forward and helped her to\r\nher feet, when she saw that he was John Loveday.\r\n\r\n\'Are you hurt?\' he said hastily, having turned quite pale at seeing her\r\nfall.\r\n\r\n\'O no; not a bit,\' said Anne, gathering herself up with forced briskness,\r\nto make light of the misadventure.\r\n\r\n\'But how did you get in such a place?\'\r\n\r\n\'There, he\'s gone!\' she exclaimed, instead of replying, as Champion swept\r\nround John Loveday and cantered off triumphantly in the direction of\r\nOxwell, a performance which she followed with her eyes.\r\n\r\n\'But how did you come upon his back, and whose horse is it?\'\r\n\r\n\'I will tell you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well?\'\r\n\r\n\'I--cannot tell you.\'\r\n\r\nJohn looked steadily at her, saying nothing.\r\n\r\n\'How did you come here?\' she asked.  \'Is it true that the French have not\r\nlanded at all?\'\r\n\r\n\'Quite true; the alarm was groundless.  I\'ll tell you all about it.  You\r\nlook very tired.  You had better sit down a few minutes.  Let us sit on\r\nthis bank.\'\r\n\r\nHe helped her to the slope indicated, and continued, still as if his\r\nthoughts were more occupied with the mystery of her recent situation than\r\nwith what he was saying: \'We arrived at Budmouth Barracks this morning,\r\nand are to lie there all the summer.  I could not write to tell father we\r\nwere coming.  It was not because of any rumour of the French, for we knew\r\nnothing of that till we met the people on the road, and the colonel said\r\nin a moment the news was false.  Buonaparte is not even at Boulogne just\r\nnow.  I was anxious to know how you had borne the fright, so I hastened\r\nto Overcombe at once, as soon as I could get out of barracks.\'\r\n\r\nAnne, who had not been at all responsive to his discourse, now swayed\r\nheavily against him, and looking quickly down he found that she had\r\nsilently fainted.  To support her in his arms was of course the impulse\r\nof a moment.  There was no water to be had, and he could think of nothing\r\nelse but to hold her tenderly till she came round again.  Certainly he\r\ndesired nothing more.\r\n\r\nAgain he asked himself, what did it all mean?\r\n\r\nHe waited, looking down upon her tired eyelids, and at the row of lashes\r\nlying upon each cheek, whose natural roundness showed itself in singular\r\nperfection now that the customary pink had given place to a pale\r\nluminousness caught from the surrounding atmosphere.  The dumpy ringlets\r\nabout her forehead and behind her poll, which were usually as tight as\r\nsprings, had been partially uncoiled by the wildness of her ride, and\r\nhung in split locks over her forehead and neck.  John, who, during the\r\nlong months of his absence, had lived only to meet her again, was in a\r\nstate of ecstatic reverence, and bending down he gently kissed her.\r\n\r\nAnne was just becoming conscious.\r\n\r\n\'O, Mr. Derriman, never, never!\' she murmured, sweeping her face with her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\'I thought he was at the bottom of it,\' said John.\r\n\r\nAnne opened her eyes, and started back from him.  \'What is it?\' she said\r\nwildly.\r\n\r\n\'You are ill, my dear Miss Garland,\' replied John in trembling anxiety,\r\nand taking her hand.\r\n\r\n\'I am not ill, I am wearied out!\' she said.  \'Can\'t we walk on?  How far\r\nare we from Overcombe?\'\r\n\r\n\'About a mile.  But tell me, somebody has been hurting you--frightening\r\nyou.  I know who it was; it was Derriman, and that was his horse.  Now do\r\nyou tell me all.\'\r\n\r\nAnne reflected.  \'Then if I tell you,\' she said, \'will you discuss with\r\nme what I had better do, and not for the present let my mother and your\r\nfather know?  I don\'t want to alarm them, and I must not let my affairs\r\ninterrupt the business connexion between the mill and the hall that has\r\ngone on for so many years.\'\r\n\r\nThe trumpet-major promised, and Anne told the adventure.  His brow\r\nreddened as she went on, and when she had done she said, \'Now you are\r\nangry.  Don\'t do anything dreadful, will you?  Remember that this Festus\r\nwill most likely succeed his uncle at Oxwell, in spite of present\r\nappearances, and if Bob succeeds at the mill there should be no enmity\r\nbetween them.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s true.  I won\'t tell Bob.  Leave him to me.  Where is Derriman\r\nnow?  On his way home, I suppose.  When I have seen you into the house I\r\nwill deal with him--quite quietly, so that he shall say nothing about\r\nit.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, appeal to him, do!  Perhaps he will be better then.\'\r\n\r\nThey walked on together, Loveday seeming to experience much quiet bliss.\r\n\r\n\'I came to look for you,\' he said, \'because of that dear, sweet letter\r\nyou wrote.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I did write you a letter,\' she admitted, with misgiving, now\r\nbeginning to see her mistake.  \'It was because I was sorry I had blamed\r\nyou.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am almost glad you did blame me,\' said John cheerfully, \'since, if you\r\nhad not, the letter would not have come.  I have read it fifty times a\r\nday.\'\r\n\r\nThis put Anne into an unhappy mood, and they proceeded without much\r\nfurther talk till the mill chimneys were visible below them.  John then\r\nsaid that he would leave her to go in by herself.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, you are going back to get into some danger on my account?\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t get into much danger with such a fellow as he, can I?\' said\r\nJohn, smiling.\r\n\r\n\'Well, no,\' she answered, with a sudden carelessness of tone.  It was\r\nindispensable that he should be undeceived, and to begin the process by\r\ntaking an affectedly light view of his personal risks was perhaps as good\r\na way to do it as any.  Where friendliness was construed as love, an\r\nassumed indifference was the necessary expression for friendliness.\r\n\r\nSo she let him go; and, bidding him hasten back as soon as he could, went\r\ndown the hill, while John\'s feet retraced the upland.\r\n\r\nThe trumpet-major spent the whole afternoon and evening in that long and\r\ndifficult search for Festus Derriman.  Crossing the down at the end of\r\nthe second hour he met Molly and Mrs. Loveday.  The gig had been\r\nrepaired, they had learnt the groundlessness of the alarm, and they would\r\nhave been proceeding happily enough but for their anxiety about Anne.\r\nJohn told them shortly that she had got a lift home, and proceeded on his\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe worthy object of his search had in the meantime been plodding\r\nhomeward on foot, sulky at the loss of his charger, encumbered with his\r\nsword, belts, high boots, and uniform, and in his own discomfiture\r\ncareless whether Anne Garland\'s life had been endangered or not.\r\n\r\nAt length Derriman reached a place where the road ran between high banks,\r\none of which he mounted and paced along as a change from the hard\r\ntrackway.  Ahead of him he saw an old man sitting down, with eyes fixed\r\non the dust of the road, as if resting and meditating at one and the same\r\ntime.  Being pretty sure that he recognized his uncle in that venerable\r\nfigure, Festus came forward stealthily, till he was immediately above the\r\nold man\'s back.  The latter was clothed in faded nankeen breeches,\r\nspeckled stockings, a drab hat, and a coat which had once been light\r\nblue, but from exposure as a scarecrow had assumed the complexion and\r\nfibre of a dried pudding-cloth.  The farmer was, in fact, returning to\r\nthe hall, which he had left in the morning some time later than his\r\nnephew, to seek an asylum in a hollow tree about two miles off.  The tree\r\nwas so situated as to command a view of the building, and Uncle Benjy had\r\nmanaged to clamber up inside this natural fortification high enough to\r\nwatch his residence through a hole in the bark, till, gathering from the\r\nwords of occasional passers-by that the alarm was at least premature, he\r\nhad ventured into daylight again.\r\n\r\nHe was now engaged in abstractedly tracing a diagram in the dust with his\r\nwalking-stick, and muttered words to himself aloud.  Presently he arose\r\nand went on his way without turning round.  Festus was curious enough to\r\ndescend and look at the marks.  They represented an oblong, with two semi-\r\ndiagonals, and a little square in the middle.  Upon the diagonals were\r\nthe figures 20 and 17, and on each side of the parallelogram stood a\r\nletter signifying the point of the compass.\r\n\r\n\'What crazy thing is running in his head now?\' said Festus to himself,\r\nwith supercilious pity, recollecting that the farmer had been singing\r\nthose very numbers earlier in the morning.  Being able to make nothing of\r\nit, he lengthened his strides, and treading on tiptoe overtook his\r\nrelative, saluting him by scratching his back like a hen.  The startled\r\nold farmer danced round like a top, and gasping, said, as he perceived\r\nhis nephew, \'What, Festy! not thrown from your horse and killed, then,\r\nafter all!\'\r\n\r\n\'No, nunc.  What made ye think that?\'\r\n\r\n\'Champion passed me about an hour ago, when I was in hiding--poor timid\r\nsoul of me, for I had nothing to lose by the French coming--and he looked\r\nawful with the stirrups dangling and the saddle empty.  \'Tis a gloomy\r\nsight, Festy, to see a horse cantering without a rider, and I thought you\r\nhad been--feared you had been thrown off and killed as dead as a nit.\'\r\n\r\n\'Bless your dear old heart for being so anxious!  And what pretty picture\r\nwere you drawing just now with your walking-stick!\'\r\n\r\n\'O, that!  That is only a way I have of amusing myself.  It showed how\r\nthe French might have advanced to the attack, you know.  Such trifles\r\nfill the head of a weak old man like me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Or the place where something is hid away--money, for instance?\'\r\n\r\n\'Festy,\' said the farmer reproachfully, \'you always know I use the old\r\nglove in the bedroom cupboard for any guinea or two I possess.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course I do,\' said Festus ironically.\r\n\r\nThey had now reached a lonely inn about a mile and a half from the hall,\r\nand, the farmer not responding to his nephew\'s kind invitation to come in\r\nand treat him, Festus entered alone.  He was dusty, draggled, and weary,\r\nand he remained at the tavern long.  The trumpet-major, in the meantime,\r\nhaving searched the roads in vain, heard in the course of the evening of\r\nthe yeoman\'s arrival at this place, and that he would probably be found\r\nthere still.  He accordingly approached the door, reaching it just as the\r\ndusk of evening changed to darkness.\r\n\r\nThere was no light in the passage, but John pushed on at hazard, inquired\r\nfor Derriman, and was told that he would be found in the back parlour\r\nalone.  When Loveday first entered the apartment he was unable to see\r\nanything, but following the guidance of a vigorous snoring, he came to\r\nthe settle, upon which Festus lay asleep, his position being faintly\r\nsignified by the shine of his buttons and other parts of his uniform.\r\nJohn laid his hand upon the reclining figure and shook him, and by\r\ndegrees Derriman stopped his snore and sat up.\r\n\r\n\'Who are you?\' he said, in the accents of a man who has been drinking\r\nhard.  \'Is it you, dear Anne?  Let me kiss you; yes, I will.\'\r\n\r\n\'Shut your mouth, you pitiful blockhead; I\'ll teach you genteeler manners\r\nthan to persecute a young woman in that way!\' and taking Festus by the\r\near, he gave it a good pull.  Festus broke out with an oath, and struck a\r\nvague blow in the air with his fist; whereupon the trumpet-major dealt\r\nhim a box on the right ear, and a similar one on the left to artistically\r\nbalance the first.  Festus jumped up and used his fists wildly, but\r\nwithout any definite result.\r\n\r\n\'Want to fight, do ye, eh?\' said John.  \'Nonsense! you can\'t fight, you\r\ngreat baby, and never could.  You are only fit to be smacked!\' and he\r\ndealt Festus a specimen of the same on the cheek with the palm of his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\'No, sir, no!  O, you are Loveday, the young man she\'s going to be\r\nmarried to, I suppose?  Dash me, I didn\'t want to hurt her, sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, my name is Loveday; and you\'ll know where to find me, since we\r\ncan\'t finish this to-night.  Pistols or swords, whichever you like, my\r\nboy.  Take that, and that, so that you may not forget to call upon me!\'\r\nand again he smacked the yeoman\'s ears and cheeks.  \'Do you know what it\r\nis for, eh?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, Mr. Loveday, sir--yes, I mean, I do.\'\r\n\r\n\'What is it for, then?  I shall keep smacking until you tell me.  Gad! if\r\nyou weren\'t drunk, I\'d half kill you here to-night.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is because I served her badly.  Damned if I care!  I\'ll do it again,\r\nand be hanged to \'ee!  Where\'s my horse Champion?  Tell me that,\' and he\r\nhit at the trumpet-major.\r\n\r\nJohn parried this attack, and taking him firmly by the collar, pushed him\r\ndown into the seat, saying, \'Here I hold \'ee till you beg pardon for your\r\ndoings to-day.  Do you want any more of it, do you?\'  And he shook the\r\nyeoman to a sort of jelly.\r\n\r\n\'I do beg pardon--no, I don\'t.  I say this, that you shall not take such\r\nliberties with old Squire Derriman\'s nephew, you dirty miller\'s son, you\r\nflour-worm, you smut in the corn!  I\'ll call you out to-morrow morning,\r\nand have my revenge.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course you will; that\'s what I came for.\'  And pushing him back into\r\nthe corner of the settle, Loveday went out of the house, feeling\r\nconsiderable satisfaction at having got himself into the beginning of as\r\nnice a quarrel about Anne Garland as the most jealous lover could desire.\r\n\r\nBut of one feature in this curious adventure he had not the least\r\nnotion--that Festus Derriman, misled by the darkness, the fumes of his\r\npotations, and the constant sight of Anne and Bob together, never once\r\nsupposed his assailant to be any other man than Bob, believing the\r\ntrumpet-major miles away.\r\n\r\nThere was a moon during the early part of John\'s walk home, but when he\r\nhad arrived within a mile of Overcombe the sky clouded over, and rain\r\nsuddenly began to fall with some violence.  Near him was a wooden granary\r\non tall stone staddles, and perceiving that the rain was only a\r\nthunderstorm which would soon pass away, he ascended the steps and\r\nentered the doorway, where he stood watching the half-obscured moon\r\nthrough the streaming rain.  Presently, to his surprise, he beheld a\r\nfemale figure running forward with great rapidity, not towards the\r\ngranary for shelter, but towards open ground.  What could she be running\r\nfor in that direction?  The answer came in the appearance of his brother\r\nBob from that quarter, seated on the back of his father\'s heavy horse.  As\r\nsoon as the woman met him, Bob dismounted and caught her in his arms.\r\nThey stood locked together, the rain beating into their unconscious\r\nforms, and the horse looking on.\r\n\r\nThe trumpet-major fell back inside the granary, and threw himself on a\r\nheap of empty sacks which lay in the corner: he had recognized the woman\r\nto be Anne.  Here he reclined in a stupor till he was aroused by the\r\nsound of voices under him, the voices of Anne and his brother, who,\r\nhaving at last discovered that they were getting wet, had taken shelter\r\nunder the granary floor.\r\n\r\n\'I have been home,\' said she.  \'Mother and Molly have both got back long\r\nago.  We were all anxious about you, and I came out to look for you.  O,\r\nBob, I am so glad to see you again!\'\r\n\r\nJohn might have heard every word of the conversation, which was continued\r\nin the same strain for a long time; but he stopped his ears, and would\r\nnot.  Still they remained, and still was he determined that they should\r\nnot see him.  With the conserved hope of more than half a year dashed\r\naway in a moment, he could yet feel that the cruelty of a protest would\r\nbe even greater than its inutility.  It was absolutely by his own\r\ncontrivance that the situation had been shaped.  Bob, left to himself,\r\nwould long ere this have been the husband of another woman.\r\n\r\nThe rain decreased, and the lovers went on.  John looked after them as\r\nthey strolled, aqua-tinted by the weak moon and mist.  Bob had thrust one\r\nof his arms through the rein of the horse, and the other was round Anne\'s\r\nwaist.  When they were lost behind the declivity the trumpet-major came\r\nout, and walked homeward even more slowly than they.  As he went on, his\r\nface put off its complexion of despair for one of serene resolve.  For\r\nthe first time in his dealings with friends he entered upon a course of\r\ncounterfeiting, set his features to conceal his thought, and instructed\r\nhis tongue to do likewise.  He threw fictitiousness into his very gait,\r\neven now, when there was nobody to see him, and struck at stems of wild\r\nparsley with his regimental switch as he had used to do when soldiering\r\nwas new to him, and life in general a charming experience.\r\n\r\nThus cloaking his sickly thought, he descended to the mill as the others\r\nhad done before him, occasionally looking down upon the wet road to\r\nnotice how close Anne\'s little tracks were to Bob\'s all the way along,\r\nand how precisely a curve in his course was followed by a curve in hers.\r\nBut after this he erected his head and walked so smartly up to the front\r\ndoor that his spurs rang through the court.\r\n\r\nThey had all reached home, but before any of them could speak he cried\r\ngaily, \'Ah, Bob, I have been thinking of you!  By God, how are you, my\r\nboy?  No French cut-throats after all, you see.  Here we are, well and\r\nhappy together again.\'\r\n\r\n\'A good Providence has watched over us,\' said Mrs. Loveday cheerfully.\r\n\'Yes, in all times and places we are in God\'s hand.\'\r\n\r\n\'So we be, so we be!\' said the miller, who still shone in all the\r\nfierceness of uniform.  \'Well, now we\'ll ha\'e a drop o\' drink.\'\r\n\r\n\'There\'s none,\' said David, coming forward with a drawn face.\r\n\r\n\'What!\' said the miller.\r\n\r\n\'Afore I went to church for a pike to defend my native country from\r\nBoney, I pulled out the spigots of all the barrels, maister; for, thinks\r\nI--damn him!--since we can\'t drink it ourselves, he shan\'t have it, nor\r\nnone of his men.\'\r\n\r\n\'But you shouldn\'t have done it till you was sure he\'d come!\' said the\r\nmiller, aghast.\r\n\r\n\'Chok\' it all, I was sure!\' said David.  \'I\'d sooner see churches fall\r\nthan good drink wasted; but how was I to know better?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, well; what with one thing and another this day will cost me a\r\npretty penny!\' said Loveday, bustling off to the cellar, which he found\r\nto be several inches deep in stagnant liquor.  \'John, how can I welcome\r\n\'ee?\' he continued hopelessly, on his return to the room.  \'Only go and\r\nsee what he\'s done!\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve ladled up a drap wi\' a spoon, trumpet-major,\' said David.  \'\'Tisn\'t\r\nbad drinking, though it do taste a little of the floor, that\'s true.\'\r\n\r\nJohn said that he did not require anything at all; and then they all sat\r\ndown to supper, and were very temperately gay with a drop of mild elder-\r\nwine which Mrs. Loveday found in the bottom of a jar.  The trumpet-major,\r\nadhering to the part he meant to play, gave humorous accounts of his\r\nadventures since he had last sat there.  He told them that the season was\r\nto be a very lively one--that the royal family was coming, as usual, and\r\nmany other interesting things; so that when he left them to return to\r\nbarracks few would have supposed the British army to contain a lighter-\r\nhearted man.\r\n\r\nAnne was the only one who doubted the reality of this behaviour.  When\r\nshe had gone up to her bedroom she stood for some time looking at the\r\nwick of the candle as if it were a painful object, the expression of her\r\nface being shaped by the conviction that John\'s afternoon words when he\r\nhelped her out of the way of Champion were not in accordance with his\r\nwords to-night, and that the dimly-realized kiss during her faintness was\r\nno imaginary one.  But in the blissful circumstances of having Bob at\r\nhand again she took optimist views, and persuaded herself that John would\r\nsoon begin to see her in the light of a sister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX.  A DISSEMBLER\r\n\r\n\r\nTo cursory view, John Loveday seemed to accomplish this with amazing\r\nease.  Whenever he came from barracks to Overcombe, which was once or\r\ntwice a week, he related news of all sorts to her and Bob with infinite\r\nzest, and made the time as happy a one as had ever been known at the\r\nmill, save for himself alone.  He said nothing of Festus, except so far\r\nas to inform Anne that he had expected to see him and been disappointed.\r\nOn the evening after the King\'s arrival at his seaside residence John\r\nappeared again, staying to supper and describing the royal entry, the\r\nmany tasteful illuminations and transparencies which had been exhibited,\r\nthe quantities of tallow candles burnt for that purpose, and the swarms\r\nof aristocracy who had followed the King thither.\r\n\r\nWhen supper was over Bob went outside the house to shut the shutters,\r\nwhich had, as was often the case, been left open some time after lights\r\nwere kindled within.  John still sat at the table when his brother\r\napproached the window, though the others had risen and retired.  Bob was\r\nstruck by seeing through the pane how John\'s face had changed.  Throughout\r\nthe supper-time he had been talking to Anne in the gay tone habitual with\r\nhim now, which gave greater strangeness to the gloom of his present\r\nappearance.  He remained in thought for a moment, took a letter from his\r\nbreast-pocket, opened it, and, with a tender smile at his weakness,\r\nkissed the writing before restoring it to its place.  The letter was one\r\nthat Anne had written to him at Exonbury.\r\n\r\nBob stood perplexed; and then a suspicion crossed his mind that John,\r\nfrom brotherly goodness, might be feigning a satisfaction with recent\r\nevents which he did not feel.  Bob now made a noise with the shutters, at\r\nwhich the trumpet-major rose and went out, Bob at once following him.\r\n\r\n\'Jack,\' said the sailor ingenuously, \'I\'m terribly sorry that I\'ve done\r\nwrong.\'\r\n\r\n\'How?\' asked his brother.\r\n\r\n\'In courting our little Anne.  Well, you see, John, she was in the same\r\nhouse with me, and somehow or other I made myself her beau.  But I have\r\nbeen thinking that perhaps you had the first claim on her, and if so,\r\nJack, I\'ll make way for \'ee.  I--I don\'t care for her much, you know--not\r\nso very much, and can give her up very well.  It is nothing serious\r\nbetween us at all.  Yes, John, you try to get her; I can look elsewhere.\'\r\nBob never knew how much he loved Anne till he found himself making this\r\nspeech of renunciation.\r\n\r\n\'O Bob, you are mistaken!\' said the trumpet-major, who was not deceived.\r\n\'When I first saw her I admired her, and I admire her now, and like her.\r\nI like her so well that I shall be glad to see you marry her.\'\r\n\r\n\'But,\' replied Bob, with hesitation, \'I thought I saw you looking very\r\nsad, as if you were in love; I saw you take out a letter, in short.\r\nThat\'s what it was disturbed me and made me come to you.\'\r\n\r\n\'O, I see your mistake!\' said John, laughing forcedly.\r\n\r\nAt this minute Mrs. Loveday and the miller, who were taking a twilight\r\nwalk in the garden, strolled round near to where the brothers stood.  She\r\ntalked volubly on events in Budmouth, as most people did at this time.\r\n\'And they tell me that the theatre has been painted up afresh,\' she was\r\nsaying, \'and that the actors have come for the season, with the most\r\nlovely actresses that ever were seen.\'\r\n\r\nWhen they had passed by John continued, \'I _am_ in love, Bob; but--not\r\nwith Anne.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah! who is it then?\' said the mate hopefully.\r\n\r\n\'One of the actresses at the theatre,\' John replied, with a concoctive\r\nlook at the vanishing forms of Mr. and Mrs. Loveday.  \'She is a very\r\nlovely woman, you know.  But we won\'t say anything more about it--it\r\ndashes a man so.\'\r\n\r\n\'O, one of the actresses!\' said Bob, with open mouth.\r\n\r\n\'But don\'t you say anything about it!\' continued the trumpet-major\r\nheartily.  \'I don\'t want it known.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no--I won\'t, of course.  May I not know her name?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, not now, Bob.  I cannot tell \'ee,\' John answered, and with truth,\r\nfor Loveday did not know the name of any actress in the world.\r\n\r\nWhen his brother had gone, Captain Bob hastened off in a state of great\r\nanimation to Anne, whom he found on the top of a neighbouring hillock\r\nwhich the daylight had scarcely as yet deserted.\r\n\r\n\'You have been a long time coming, sir,\' said she, in sprightly tones of\r\nreproach.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, dearest; and you\'ll be glad to hear why.  I\'ve found out the whole\r\nmystery--yes--why he\'s queer, and everything.\'\r\n\r\nAnne looked startled.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s up to the gunnel in love!  We must try to help him on in it, or I\r\nfear he\'ll go melancholy-mad like.\'\r\n\r\n\'We help him?\' she asked faintly.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s lost his heart to one of the play-actresses at Budmouth, and I\r\nthink she slights him.\'\r\n\r\n\'O, I am so glad!\' she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\'Glad that his venture don\'t prosper?\'\r\n\r\n\'O no; glad he\'s so sensible.  How long is it since that alarm of the\r\nFrench?\'\r\n\r\n\'Six weeks, honey.  Why do you ask?\'\r\n\r\n\'Men can forget in six weeks, can\'t they, Bob?\'\r\n\r\nThe impression that John had really kissed her still remained.\r\n\r\n\'Well, some men might,\' observed Bob judicially.  \'_I_ couldn\'t.  Perhaps\r\nJohn might.  I couldn\'t forget _you_ in twenty times as long.  Do you\r\nknow, Anne, I half thought it was you John cared about; and it was a\r\nweight off my heart when he said he didn\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did he say he didn\'t?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  He assured me himself that the only person in the hold of his\r\nheart was this lovely play-actress, and nobody else.\'\r\n\r\n\'How I should like to see her!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  So should I.\'\r\n\r\n\'I would rather it had been one of our own neighbours\' girls, whose birth\r\nand breeding we know of; but still, if that is his taste, I hope it will\r\nend well for him.  How very quick he has been!  I certainly wish we could\r\nsee her.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know so much as her name.  He is very close, and wouldn\'t tell a\r\nthing about her.\'\r\n\r\n\'Couldn\'t we get him to go to the theatre with us? and then we could\r\nwatch him, and easily find out the right one.  Then we would learn if she\r\nis a good young woman; and if she is, could we not ask her here, and so\r\nmake it smoother for him?  He has been very gay lately; that means\r\nbudding love: and sometimes between his gaieties he has had melancholy\r\nmoments; that means there\'s difficulty.\'\r\n\r\nBob thought her plan a good one, and resolved to put it in practice on\r\nthe first available evening.  Anne was very curious as to whether John\r\ndid really cherish a new passion, the story having quite surprised her.\r\nPossibly it was true; six weeks had passed since John had shown a single\r\nsymptom of the old attachment, and what could not that space of time\r\neffect in the heart of a soldier whose very profession it was to leave\r\ngirls behind him?\r\n\r\nAfter this John Loveday did not come to see them for nearly a month, a\r\nneglect which was set down by Bob as an additional proof that his\r\nbrother\'s affections were no longer exclusively centred in his old home.\r\nWhen at last he did arrive, and the theatre-going was mentioned to him,\r\nthe flush of consciousness which Anne expected to see upon his face was\r\nunaccountably absent.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, Bob; I should very well like to go to the theatre,\' he replied\r\nheartily.  \'Who is going besides?\'\r\n\r\n\'Only Anne,\' Bob told him, and then it seemed to occur to the trumpet-\r\nmajor that something had been expected of him.  He rose and said\r\nprivately to Bob with some confusion, \'O yes, of course we\'ll go.  As I\r\nam connected with one of the--in short I can get you in for nothing, you\r\nknow.  At least let me manage everything.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes.  I wonder you didn\'t propose to take us before, Jack, and let\r\nus have a good look at her.\'\r\n\r\n\'I ought to have.  You shall go on a King\'s night.  You won\'t want me to\r\npoint her out, Bob; I have my reasons at present for asking it?\'\r\n\r\n\'We\'ll be content with guessing,\' said his brother.\r\n\r\nWhen the gallant John was gone, Anne observed, \'Bob, how he is changed!  I\r\nwatched him.  He showed no feeling, even when you burst upon him suddenly\r\nwith the subject nearest his heart.\'\r\n\r\n\'It must be because his suit don\'t fay,\' said Captain Bob.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX.  AT THE THEATRE ROYAL\r\n\r\n\r\nIn two or three days a message arrived asking them to attend at the\r\ntheatre on the coming evening, with the added request that they would\r\ndress in their gayest clothes, to do justice to the places taken.\r\nAccordingly, in the course of the afternoon they drove off, Bob having\r\nclothed himself in a splendid suit, recently purchased as an attempt to\r\nbring himself nearer to Anne\'s style when they appeared in public\r\ntogether.  As finished off by this dashing and really fashionable attire,\r\nhe was the perfection of a beau in the dog-days; pantaloons and boots of\r\nthe newest make; yards and yards of muslin wound round his neck, forming\r\na sort of asylum for the lower part of his face; two fancy waistcoats,\r\nand coat-buttons like circular shaving glasses.  The absurd extreme of\r\nfemale fashion, which was to wear muslin dresses in January, was at this\r\ntime equalled by that of the men, who wore clothes enough in August to\r\nmelt them.  Nobody would have guessed from Bob\'s presentation now that he\r\nhad ever been aloft on a dark night in the Atlantic, or knew the hundred\r\ningenuities that could be performed with a rope\'s end and a marline-spike\r\nas well as his mother tongue.\r\n\r\nIt was a day of days.  Anne wore her celebrated celestial blue pelisse,\r\nher Leghorn hat, and her muslin dress with the waist under the arms; the\r\nlatter being decorated with excellent Honiton lace bought of the woman\r\nwho travelled from that place to Overcombe and its neighbourhood with a\r\nbasketful of her own manufacture, and a cushion on which she worked by\r\nthe wayside.  John met the lovers at the inn outside the town, and after\r\nstabling the horse they entered the town together, the trumpet-major\r\ninforming them that the watering-place had never been so full before,\r\nthat the Court, the Prince of Wales, and everybody of consequence was\r\nthere, and that an attic could scarcely be got for money.  The King had\r\ngone for a cruise in his yacht, and they would be in time to see him\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThen drums and fifes were heard, and in a minute or two they saw Sergeant\r\nStanner advancing along the street with a firm countenance, fiery poll,\r\nand rigid staring eyes, in front of his recruiting-party.  The sergeant\'s\r\nsword was drawn, and at intervals of two or three inches along its\r\nshining blade were impaled fluttering one-pound notes, to express the\r\nlavish bounty that was offered.  He gave a stern, suppressed nod of\r\nfriendship to our people, and passed by.  Next they came up to a waggon,\r\nbowered over with leaves and flowers, so that the men inside could hardly\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\n\'Come to see the King, hip-hip hurrah!\' cried a voice within, and turning\r\nthey saw through the leaves the nose and face of Cripplestraw.  The\r\nwaggon contained all Derriman\'s workpeople.\r\n\r\n\'Is your master here?\' said John.\r\n\r\n\'No, trumpet-major, sir.  But young maister is coming to fetch us at nine\r\no\'clock, in case we should be too blind to drive home.\'\r\n\r\n\'O! where is he now?\'\r\n\r\n\'Never mind,\' said Anne impatiently, at which the trumpet-major\r\nobediently moved on.\r\n\r\nBy the time they reached the pier it was six o\'clock; the royal yacht was\r\nreturning; a fact announced by the ships in the harbour firing a salute.\r\nThe King came ashore with his hat in his hand, and returned the\r\nsalutations of the well-dressed crowd in his old indiscriminate fashion.\r\nWhile this cheering and waving of handkerchiefs was going on Anne stood\r\nbetween the two brothers, who protectingly joined their hands behind her\r\nback, as if she were a delicate piece of statuary that a push might\r\ndamage.  Soon the King had passed, and receiving the military salutes of\r\nthe piquet, joined the Queen and princesses at Gloucester Lodge, the\r\nhomely house of red brick in which he unostentatiously resided.\r\n\r\nAs there was yet some little time before the theatre would open, they\r\nstrayed upon the velvet sands, and listened to the songs of the sailors,\r\none of whom extemporized for the occasion:--\r\n\r\n   \'Portland Road the King aboard, the King aboard!\r\n   Portland Road the King aboard,\r\n   We weighed and sailed from Portland Road!\' {272}\r\n\r\nWhen they had looked on awhile at the combats at single-stick which were\r\nin progress hard by, and seen the sum of five guineas handed over to the\r\nmodest gentleman who had broken most heads, they returned to Gloucester\r\nLodge, whence the King and other members of his family now reappeared,\r\nand drove, at a slow trot, round to the theatre in carriages drawn by the\r\nHanoverian white horses that were so well known in the town at this date.\r\n\r\nWhen Anne and Bob entered the theatre they found that John had taken\r\nexcellent places, and concluded that he had got them for nothing through\r\nthe influence of the lady of his choice.  As a matter of fact he had paid\r\nfull prices for those two seats, like any other outsider, and even then\r\nhad a difficulty in getting them, it being a King\'s night.  When they\r\nwere settled he himself retired to an obscure part of the pit, from which\r\nthe stage was scarcely visible.\r\n\r\n\'We can see beautifully,\' said Bob, in an aristocratic voice, as he took\r\na delicate pinch of snuff, and drew out the magnificent\r\npocket-handkerchief brought home from the East for such occasions.  \'But\r\nI am afraid poor John can\'t see at all.\'\r\n\r\n\'But we can see him,\' replied Anne, \'and notice by his face which of them\r\nit is he is so charmed with.  The light of that corner candle falls right\r\nupon his cheek.\'\r\n\r\nBy this time the King had appeared in his place, which was overhung by a\r\ncanopy of crimson satin fringed with gold.  About twenty places were\r\noccupied by the royal family and suite; and beyond them was a crowd of\r\npowdered and glittering personages of fashion, completely filling the\r\ncentre of the little building; though the King so frequently patronized\r\nthe local stage during these years that the crush was not inconvenient.\r\n\r\nThe curtain rose and the play began.  To-night it was one of Colman\'s,\r\nwho at this time enjoyed great popularity, and Mr. Bannister supported\r\nthe leading character.  Anne, with her hand privately clasped in Bob\'s,\r\nand looking as if she did not know it, partly watched the piece and\r\npartly the face of the impressionable John who had so soon transferred\r\nhis affections elsewhere.  She had not long to wait.  When a certain one\r\nof the subordinate ladies of the comedy entered on the stage the trumpet-\r\nmajor in his corner not only looked conscious, but started and gazed with\r\nparted lips.\r\n\r\n\'This must be the one,\' whispered Anne quickly.  \'See, he is agitated!\'\r\n\r\nShe turned to Bob, but at the same moment his hand convulsively closed\r\nupon hers as he, too, strangely fixed his eyes upon the newly-entered\r\nlady.\r\n\r\n\'What is it?\'\r\n\r\nAnne looked from one to the other without regarding the stage at all.  Her\r\nanswer came in the voice of the actress who now spoke for the first time.\r\nThe accents were those of Miss Matilda Johnson.\r\n\r\nOne thought rushed into both their minds on the instant, and Bob was the\r\nfirst to utter it.\r\n\r\n\'What--is she the woman of his choice after all?\'\r\n\r\n\'If so, it is a dreadful thing!\' murmured Anne.\r\n\r\nBut, as may be imagined, the unfortunate John was as much surprised by\r\nthis rencounter as the other two.  Until this moment he had been in utter\r\nignorance of the theatrical company and all that pertained to it.\r\nMoreover, much as he knew of Miss Johnson, he was not aware that she had\r\never been trained in her youth as an actress, and that after lapsing into\r\nstraits and difficulties for a couple of years she had been so fortunate\r\nas to again procure an engagement here.\r\n\r\nThe trumpet-major, though not prominently seated, had been seen by\r\nMatilda already, who had observed still more plainly her old betrothed\r\nand Anne in the other part of the house.  John was not concerned on his\r\nown account at being face to face with her, but at the extraordinary\r\nsuspicion that this conjuncture must revive in the minds of his best\r\nbeloved friends.  After some moments of pained reflection he tapped his\r\nknee.\r\n\r\n\'Gad, I won\'t explain; it shall go as it is!\' he said.  \'Let them think\r\nher mine.  Better that than the truth, after all.\'\r\n\r\nHad personal prominence in the scene been at this moment proportioned to\r\nintentness of feeling, the whole audience, regal and otherwise, would\r\nhave faded into an indistinct mist of background, leaving as the sole\r\nemergent and telling figures Bob and Anne at one point, the trumpet-major\r\non the left hand, and Matilda at the opposite corner of the stage.  But\r\nfortunately the deadlock of awkward suspense into which all four had\r\nfallen was terminated by an accident.  A messenger entered the King\'s box\r\nwith despatches.  There was an instant pause in the performance.  The\r\ndespatch-box being opened the King read for a few moments with great\r\ninterest, the eyes of the whole house, including those of Anne Garland,\r\nbeing anxiously fixed upon his face; for terrible events fell as\r\nunexpectedly as thunderbolts at this critical time of our history.  The\r\nKing at length beckoned to Lord ---, who was immediately behind him, the\r\nplay was again stopped, and the contents of the despatch were publicly\r\ncommunicated to the audience.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Calder, cruising off Finisterre, had come in sight of\r\nVilleneuve, and made the signal for action, which, though checked by the\r\nweather, had resulted in the capture of two Spanish line-of-battle ships,\r\nand the retreat of Villeneuve into Ferrol.\r\n\r\nThe news was received with truly national feeling, if noise might be\r\ntaken as an index of patriotism.  \'Rule Britannia\' was called for and\r\nsung by the whole house.  But the importance of the event was far from\r\nbeing recognized at this time; and Bob Loveday, as he sat there and heard\r\nit, had very little conception how it would bear upon his destiny.\r\n\r\nThis parenthetic excitement diverted for a few minutes the eyes of Bob\r\nand Anne from the trumpet-major; and when the play proceeded, and they\r\nlooked back to his corner, he was gone.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s just slipped round to talk to her behind the scenes,\' said Bob\r\nknowingly.  \'Shall we go too, and tease him for a sly dog?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, I would rather not.\'\r\n\r\n\'Shall we go home, then?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not unless her presence is too much for you?\'\r\n\r\n\'O--not at all.  We\'ll stay here.  Ah, there she is again.\'\r\n\r\nThey sat on, and listened to Matilda\'s speeches which she delivered with\r\nsuch delightful coolness that they soon began to considerably interest\r\none of the party.\r\n\r\n\'Well, what a nerve the young woman has!\' he said at last in tones of\r\nadmiration, and gazing at Miss Johnson with all his might.  \'After all,\r\nJack\'s taste is not so bad.  She\'s really deuced clever.\'\r\n\r\n\'Bob, I\'ll go home if you wish to,\' said Anne quickly.\r\n\r\n\'O no--let us see how she fleets herself off that bit of a scrape she\'s\r\nplaying at now.  Well, what a hand she is at it, to be sure!\'\r\n\r\nAnne said no more, but waited on, supremely uncomfortable, and almost\r\ntearful.  She began to feel that she did not like life particularly well;\r\nit was too complicated: she saw nothing of the scene, and only longed to\r\nget away, and to get Bob away with her.  At last the curtain fell on the\r\nfinal act, and then began the farce of \'No Song no Supper.\'  Matilda did\r\nnot appear in this piece, and Anne again inquired if they should go home.\r\nThis time Bob agreed, and taking her under his care with redoubled\r\naffection, to make up for the species of coma which had seized upon his\r\nheart for a time, he quietly accompanied her out of the house.\r\n\r\nWhen they emerged upon the esplanade, the August moon was shining across\r\nthe sea from the direction of St. Aldhelm\'s Head.  Bob unconsciously\r\nloitered, and turned towards the pier.  Reaching the end of the promenade\r\nthey surveyed the quivering waters in silence for some time, until a long\r\ndark line shot from behind the promontory of the Nothe, and swept forward\r\ninto the harbour.\r\n\r\n\'What boat is that?\' said Anne.\r\n\r\n\'It seems to be some frigate lying in the Roads,\' said Bob carelessly, as\r\nhe brought Anne round with a gentle pressure of his arm and bent his\r\nsteps towards the homeward end of the town.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Miss Johnson, having finished her duties for that evening,\r\nrapidly changed her dress, and went out likewise.  The prominent position\r\nwhich Anne and Captain Bob had occupied side by side in the theatre, left\r\nher no alternative but to suppose that the situation was arranged by Bob\r\nas a species of defiance to herself; and her heart, such as it was,\r\nbecame proportionately embittered against him.  In spite of the rise in\r\nher fortunes, Miss Johnson still remembered--and always would\r\nremember--her humiliating departure from Overcombe; and it had been to\r\nher even a more grievous thing that Bob had acquiesced in his brother\'s\r\nruling than that John had determined it.  At the time of setting out she\r\nwas sustained by a firm faith that Bob would follow her, and nullify his\r\nbrother\'s scheme; but though she waited Bob never came.\r\n\r\nShe passed along by the houses facing the sea, and scanned the shore, the\r\nfootway, and the open road close to her, which, illuminated by the\r\nslanting moon to a great brightness, sparkled with minute facets of\r\ncrystallized salts from the water sprinkled there during the day.  The\r\npromenaders at the further edge appeared in dark profiles; and beyond\r\nthem was the grey sea, parted into two masses by the tapering braid of\r\nmoonlight across the waves.\r\n\r\nTwo forms crossed this line at a startling nearness to her; she marked\r\nthem at once as Anne and Bob Loveday.  They were walking slowly, and in\r\nthe earnestness of their discourse were oblivious of the presence of any\r\nhuman beings save themselves.  Matilda stood motionless till they had\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n\'How I love them!\' she said, treading the initial step of her walk\r\nonwards with a vehemence that walking did not demand.\r\n\r\n\'So do I--especially one,\' said a voice at her elbow; and a man wheeled\r\nround her, and looked in her face, which had been fully exposed to the\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\n\'You--who are you?\' she asked.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t you remember, ma\'am?  We walked some way together towards\r\nOvercombe earlier in the summer.\'  Matilda looked more closely, and\r\nperceived that the speaker was Derriman, in plain clothes.  He continued,\r\n\'You are one of the ladies of the theatre, I know.  May I ask why you\r\nsaid in such a queer way that you loved that couple?\'\r\n\r\n\'In a queer way?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, as if you hated them.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t mind your knowing that I have good reason to hate them.  You do\r\ntoo, it seems?\'\r\n\r\n\'That man,\' said Festus savagely, \'came to me one night about that very\r\nwoman; insulted me before I could put myself on my guard, and ran away\r\nbefore I could come up with him and avenge myself.  The woman tricks me\r\nat every turn!  I want to part \'em.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then why don\'t you?  There\'s a splendid opportunity.  Do you see that\r\nsoldier walking along?  He\'s a marine; he looks into the gallery of the\r\ntheatre every night: and he\'s in connexion with the press-gang that came\r\nashore just now from the frigate lying in Portland Roads.  They are often\r\nhere for men.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  Our boatmen dread \'em.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, we have only to tell him that Loveday is a seaman to be clear of\r\nhim this very night.\'\r\n\r\n\'Done!\' said Festus.  \'Take my arm and come this way.\'  They walked\r\nacross to the footway.  \'Fine night, sergeant.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is, sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'Looking for hands, I suppose?\'\r\n\r\n\'It is not to be known, sir.  We don\'t begin till half past ten.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is a pity you don\'t begin now.  I could show \'ee excellent game.\'\r\n\r\n\'What, that little nest of fellows at the "Old Rooms" in Cove Row?  I\r\nhave just heard of \'em.\'\r\n\r\n\'No--come here.\'  Festus, with Miss Johnson on his arm, led the sergeant\r\nquickly along the parade, and by the time they reached the Narrows the\r\nlovers, who walked but slowly, were visible in front of them.  \'There\'s\r\nyour man,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'That buck in pantaloons and half-boots--a looking like a squire?\'\r\n\r\n\'Twelve months ago he was mate of the brig Pewit; but his father has made\r\nmoney, and keeps him at home.\'\r\n\r\n\'Faith, now you tell of it, there\'s a hint of sea legs about him.  What\'s\r\nthe young beau\'s name?\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t tell!\' whispered Matilda, impulsively clutching Festus\'s arm.\r\n\r\nBut Festus had already said, \'Robert Loveday, son of the miller at\r\nOvercombe.  You may find several likely fellows in that neighbourhood.\'\r\n\r\nThe marine said that he would bear it in mind, and they left him.\r\n\r\n\'I wish you had not told,\' said Matilda tearfully.  \'She\'s the worst!\'\r\n\r\n\'Dash my eyes now; listen to that!  Why, you chicken-hearted old stager,\r\nyou was as well agreed as I.  Come now; hasn\'t he used you badly?\'\r\n\r\nMatilda\'s acrimony returned.  \'I was down on my luck, or he wouldn\'t have\r\nhad the chance!\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'Well, then, let things be.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI.  MIDNIGHT VISITORS\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Garland and Loveday walked leisurely to the inn and called for horse-\r\nand-gig.  While the hostler was bringing it round, the landlord, who knew\r\nBob and his family well, spoke to him quietly in the passage.\r\n\r\n\'Is this then because you want to throw dust in the eyes of the Black\r\nDiamond chaps?\' (with an admiring glance at Bob\'s costume).\r\n\r\n\'The Black Diamond?\' said Bob; and Anne turned pale.\r\n\r\n\'She hove in sight just after dark, and at nine o\'clock a boat having\r\nmore than a dozen marines on board, with cloaks on, rowed into harbour.\'\r\n\r\nBob reflected.  \'Then there\'ll be a press to-night; depend upon it,\' he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\'They won\'t know you, will they, Bob?\' said Anne anxiously.\r\n\r\n\'They certainly won\'t know him for a seaman now,\' remarked the landlord,\r\nlaughing, and again surveying Bob up and down.  \'But if I was you two, I\r\nshould drive home-along straight and quiet; and be very busy in the mill\r\nall to-morrow, Mr. Loveday.\'\r\n\r\nThey drove away; and when they had got onward out of the town, Anne\r\nstrained her eyes wistfully towards Portland.  Its dark contour, lying\r\nlike a whale on the sea, was just perceptible in the gloom as the\r\nbackground to half-a-dozen ships\' lights nearer at hand.\r\n\r\n\'They can\'t make you go, now you are a gentleman tradesman, can they?\'\r\nshe asked.\r\n\r\n\'If they want me they can have me, dearest.  I have often said I ought to\r\nvolunteer.\'\r\n\r\n\'And not care about me at all?\'\r\n\r\n\'It is just that that keeps me at home.  I won\'t leave you if I can help\r\nit.\'\r\n\r\n\'It cannot make such a vast difference to the country whether one man\r\ngoes or stays!  But if you want to go you had better, and not mind us at\r\nall!\'\r\n\r\nBob put a period to her speech by a mark of affection to which history\r\naffords many parallels in every age.  She said no more about the Black\r\nDiamond; but whenever they ascended a hill she turned her head to look at\r\nthe lights in Portland Roads, and the grey expanse of intervening sea.\r\n\r\nThough Captain Bob had stated that he did not wish to volunteer, and\r\nwould not leave her if he could help it, the remark required some\r\nqualification.  That Anne was charming and loving enough to chain him\r\nanywhere was true; but he had begun to find the mill-work terribly\r\nirksome at times.  Often during the last month, when standing among the\r\nrumbling cogs in his new miller\'s suit, which ill became him, he had\r\nyawned, thought wistfully of the old pea-jacket, and the waters of the\r\ndeep blue sea.  His dread of displeasing his father by showing anything\r\nof this change of sentiment was great; yet he might have braved it but\r\nfor knowing that his marriage with Anne, which he hoped might take place\r\nthe next year, was dependent entirely upon his adherence to the mill\r\nbusiness.  Even were his father indifferent, Mrs. Loveday would never\r\nintrust her only daughter to the hands of a husband who would be away\r\nfrom home five-sixths of his time.\r\n\r\nBut though, apart from Anne, he was not averse to seafaring in itself, to\r\nbe smuggled thither by the machinery of a press-gang was intolerable; and\r\nthe process of seizing, stunning, pinioning, and carrying off unwilling\r\nhands was one which Bob as a man had always determined to hold out\r\nagainst to the utmost of his power.  Hence, as they went towards home, he\r\nfrequently listened for sounds behind him, but hearing none he assured\r\nhis sweetheart that they were safe for that night at least.  The mill was\r\nstill going when they arrived, though old Mr. Loveday was not to be seen;\r\nhe had retired as soon as he heard the horse\'s hoofs in the lane, leaving\r\nBob to watch the grinding till three o\'clock; when the elder would rise,\r\nand Bob withdraw to bed--a frequent arrangement between them since Bob\r\nhad taken the place of grinder.\r\n\r\nHaving reached the privacy of her own room, Anne threw open the window,\r\nfor she had not the slightest intention of going to bed just yet.  The\r\ntale of the Black Diamond had disturbed her by a slow, insidious process\r\nthat was worse than sudden fright.  Her window looked into the court\r\nbefore the house, now wrapped in the shadow of the trees and the hill;\r\nand she leaned upon its sill listening intently.  She could have heard\r\nany strange sound distinctly enough in one direction; but in the other\r\nall low noises were absorbed in the patter of the mill, and the rush of\r\nwater down the race.\r\n\r\nHowever, what she heard came from the hitherto silent side, and was\r\nintelligible in a moment as being the footsteps of men.  She tried to\r\nthink they were some late stragglers from Budmouth.  Alas! no; the tramp\r\nwas too regular for that of villagers.  She hastily turned, extinguished\r\nthe candle, and listened again.  As they were on the main road there was,\r\nafter all, every probability that the party would pass the bridge which\r\ngave access to the mill court without turning in upon it, or even\r\nnoticing that such an entrance existed.  In this again she was\r\ndisappointed: they crossed into the front without a pause.  The\r\npulsations of her heart became a turmoil now, for why should these men,\r\nif they were the press-gang, and strangers to the locality, have supposed\r\nthat a sailor was to be found here, the younger of the two millers\r\nLoveday being never seen now in any garb which could suggest that he was\r\nother than a miller pure, like his father?  One of the men spoke.\r\n\r\n\'I am not sure that we are in the right place,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'This is a mill, anyhow,\' said another.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s lots about here.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then come this way a moment with your light.\'\r\n\r\nTwo of the group went towards the cart-house on the opposite side of the\r\nyard, and when they reached it a dark lantern was opened, the rays being\r\ndirected upon the front of the miller\'s waggon.\r\n\r\n\'"Loveday and Son, Overcombe Mill,"\' continued the man, reading from the\r\nwaggon.  \'"Son," you see, is lately painted in.  That\'s our man.\'\r\n\r\nHe moved to turn off the light, but before he had done so it flashed over\r\nthe forms of the speakers, and revealed a sergeant, a naval officer, and\r\na file of marines.\r\n\r\nAnne waited to see no more.  When Bob stayed up to grind, as he was doing\r\nto-night, he often sat in his room instead of remaining all the time in\r\nthe mill; and this room was an isolated chamber over the bakehouse, which\r\ncould not be reached without going downstairs and ascending the\r\nstep-ladder that served for his staircase.  Anne descended in the dark,\r\nclambered up the ladder, and saw that light strayed through the chink\r\nbelow the door.  His window faced towards the garden, and hence the light\r\ncould not as yet have been seen by the press-gang.\r\n\r\n\'Bob, dear Bob!\' she said, through the keyhole.  \'Put out your light, and\r\nrun out of the back-door!\'\r\n\r\n\'Why?\' said Bob, leisurely knocking the ashes from the pipe he had been\r\nsmoking.\r\n\r\n\'The press-gang!\'\r\n\r\n\'They have come?  By God! who can have blown upon me?  All right,\r\ndearest.  I\'m game.\'\r\n\r\nAnne, scarcely knowing what she did, descended the ladder and ran to the\r\nback-door, hastily unbolting it to save Bob\'s time, and gently opening it\r\nin readiness for him.  She had no sooner done this than she felt hands\r\nlaid upon her shoulder from without, and a voice exclaiming, \'That\'s how\r\nwe doos it--quite an obleeging young man!\'\r\n\r\nThough the hands held her rather roughly, Anne did not mind for herself,\r\nand turning she cried desperately, in tones intended to reach Bob\'s ears:\r\n\'They are at the back-door; try the front!\'\r\n\r\nBut inexperienced Miss Garland little knew the shrewd habits of the\r\ngentlemen she had to deal with, who, well used to this sort of pastime,\r\nhad already posted themselves at every outlet from the premises.\r\n\r\n\'Bring the lantern,\' shouted the fellow who held her.  \'Why--\'tis a girl!\r\nI half thought so--Here is a way in,\' he continued to his comrades,\r\nhastening to the foot of the ladder which led to Bob\'s room.\r\n\r\n\'What d\'ye want?\' said Bob, quietly opening the door, and showing himself\r\nstill radiant in the full dress that he had worn with such effect at the\r\nTheatre Royal, which he had been about to change for his mill suit when\r\nAnne gave the alarm.\r\n\r\n\'This gentleman can\'t be the right one,\' observed a marine, rather\r\nimpressed by Bob\'s appearance.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes; that\'s the man,\' said the sergeant.  \'Now take it quietly, my\r\nyoung cock-o\'-wax.  You look as if you meant to, and \'tis wise of ye.\'\r\n\r\n\'Where are you going to take me?\' said Bob.\r\n\r\n\'Only aboard the Black Diamond.  If you choose to take the bounty and\r\ncome voluntarily, you\'ll be allowed to go ashore whenever your ship\'s in\r\nport.  If you don\'t, and we\'ve got to pinion ye, you will not have your\r\nliberty at all.  As you must come, willy-nilly, you\'ll do the first if\r\nyou\'ve any brains whatever.\'\r\n\r\nBob\'s temper began to rise.  \'Don\'t you talk so large, about your\r\npinioning, my man.  When I\'ve settled--\'\r\n\r\n\'Now or never, young blow-hard,\' interrupted his informant.\r\n\r\n\'Come, what jabber is this going on?\' said the lieutenant, stepping\r\nforward.  \'Bring your man.\'\r\n\r\nOne of the marines set foot on the ladder, but at the same moment a shoe\r\nfrom Bob\'s hand hit the lantern with well-aimed directness, knocking it\r\nclean out of the grasp of the man who held it.  In spite of the darkness\r\nthey began to scramble up the ladder.  Bob thereupon shut the door, which\r\nbeing but of slight construction, was as he knew only a momentary\r\ndefence.  But it gained him time enough to open the window, gather up his\r\nlegs upon the sill, and spring across into the apple-tree growing\r\nwithout.  He alighted without much hurt beyond a few scratches from the\r\nboughs, a shower of falling apples testifying to the force of his leap.\r\n\r\n\'Here he is!\' shouted several below who had seen Bob\'s figure flying like\r\na raven\'s across the sky.\r\n\r\nThere was stillness for a moment in the tree.  Then the fugitive made\r\nhaste to climb out upon a low-hanging branch towards the garden, at which\r\nthe men beneath all rushed in that direction to catch him as he dropped,\r\nsaying, \'You may as well come down, old boy.  \'Twas a spry jump, and we\r\ngive ye credit for \'t.\'\r\n\r\nThe latter movement of Loveday had been a mere feint.  Partly hidden by\r\nthe leaves he glided back to the other part of the tree, from whence it\r\nwas easy to jump upon a thatch-covered out-house.  This intention they\r\ndid not appear to suspect, which gave him the opportunity of sliding down\r\nthe slope and entering the back door of the mill.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s here, he\'s here!\' the men exclaimed, running back from the tree.\r\n\r\nBy this time they had obtained another light, and pursued him closely\r\nalong the back quarters of the mill.  Bob had entered the lower room,\r\nseized hold of the chain by which the flour-sacks were hoisted from story\r\nto story by connexion with the mill-wheel, and pulled the rope that hung\r\nalongside for the purpose of throwing it into gear.  The foremost\r\npursuers arrived just in time to see Captain Bob\'s legs and shoe-buckles\r\nvanishing through the trap-door in the joists overhead, his person having\r\nbeen whirled up by the machinery like any bag of flour, and the trap\r\nfalling to behind him.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s gone up by the hoist!\' said the sergeant, running up the ladder in\r\nthe corner to the next floor, and elevating the light just in time to see\r\nBob\'s suspended figure ascending in the same way through the same sort of\r\ntrap into the second floor.  The second trap also fell together behind\r\nhim, and he was lost to view as before.\r\n\r\nIt was more difficult to follow now; there was only a flimsy little\r\nladder, and the men ascended cautiously.  When they stepped out upon the\r\nloft it was empty.\r\n\r\n\'He must ha\' let go here,\' said one of the marines, who knew more about\r\nmills than the others.  \'If he had held fast a moment longer, he would\r\nhave been dashed against that beam.\'\r\n\r\nThey looked up.  The hook by which Bob had held on had ascended to the\r\nroof, and was winding round the cylinder.  Nothing was visible elsewhere\r\nbut boarded divisions like the stalls of a stable, on each side of the\r\nstage they stood upon, these compartments being more or less heaped up\r\nwith wheat and barley in the grain.\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps he\'s buried himself in the corn.\'\r\n\r\nThe whole crew jumped into the corn-bins, and stirred about their yellow\r\ncontents; but neither arm, leg, nor coat-tail was uncovered.  They\r\nremoved sacks, peeped among the rafters of the roof, but to no purpose.\r\nThe lieutenant began to fume at the loss of time.\r\n\r\n\'What cursed fools to let the man go!  Why, look here, what\'s this?\'  He\r\nhad opened the door by which sacks were taken in from waggons without,\r\nand dangling from the cat-head projecting above it was the rope used in\r\nlifting them.  \'There\'s the way he went down,\' the officer continued.\r\n\'The man\'s gone.\'\r\n\r\nAmidst mumblings and curses the gang descended the pair of ladders and\r\ncame into the open air; but Captain Bob was nowhere to be seen.  When\r\nthey reached the front door of the house the miller was standing on the\r\nthreshold, half dressed.\r\n\r\n\'Your son is a clever fellow, miller,\' said the lieutenant; \'but it would\r\nhave been much better for him if he had come quiet.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s a matter of opinion,\' said Loveday.\r\n\r\n\'I have no doubt that he\'s in the house.\'\r\n\r\n\'He may be; and he may not.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you know where he is?\'\r\n\r\n\'I do not; and if I did I shouldn\'t tell.\'\r\n\r\n\'Naturally.\'\r\n\r\n\'I heard steps beating up the road, sir,\' said the sergeant.\r\n\r\nThey turned from the door, and leaving four of the marines to keep watch\r\nround the house, the remainder of the party marched into the lane as far\r\nas where the other road branched off.  While they were pausing to decide\r\nwhich course to take, one of the soldiers held up the light.  A black\r\nobject was discernible upon the ground before them, and they found it to\r\nbe a hat--the hat of Bob Loveday.\r\n\r\n\'We are on the track,\' cried the sergeant, deciding for this direction.\r\n\r\nThey tore on rapidly, and the footsteps previously heard became audible\r\nagain, increasing in clearness, which told that they gained upon the\r\nfugitive, who in another five minutes stopped and turned.  The rays of\r\nthe candle fell upon Anne.\r\n\r\n\'What do you want?\' she said, showing her frightened face.\r\n\r\nThey made no reply, but wheeled round and left her.  She sank down on the\r\nbank to rest, having done all she could.  It was she who had taken down\r\nBob\'s hat from a nail, and dropped it at the turning with the view of\r\nmisleading them till he should have got clear off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII.  DELIVERANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Anne Garland was too anxious to remain long away from the centre of\r\noperations.  When she got back she found that the press-gang were\r\nstanding in the court discussing their next move.\r\n\r\n\'Waste no more time here,\' the lieutenant said.  \'Two more villages to\r\nvisit to-night, and the nearest three miles off.  There\'s nobody else in\r\nthis place, and we can\'t come back again.\'\r\n\r\nWhen they were moving away, one of the private marines, who had kept his\r\neye on Anne, and noticed her distress, contrived to say in a whisper as\r\nhe passed her, \'We are coming back again as soon as it begins to get\r\nlight; that\'s only said to deceive \'ee.  Keep your young man out of the\r\nway.\'\r\n\r\nThey went as they had come; and the little household then met together,\r\nMrs. Loveday having by this time dressed herself and come down.  A long\r\nand anxious discussion followed.\r\n\r\n\'Somebody must have told upon the chap,\' Loveday remarked.  \'How should\r\nthey have found him out else, now he\'s been home from sea this\r\ntwelvemonth?\'\r\n\r\nAnne then mentioned what the friendly marine had told her; and fearing\r\nlest Bob was in the house, and would be discovered there when daylight\r\ncame, they searched and called for him everywhere.\r\n\r\n\'What clothes has he got on?\' said the miller.\r\n\r\n\'His lovely new suit,\' said his wife.  \'I warrant it is quite spoiled!\'\r\n\r\n\'He\'s got no hat,\' said Anne.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said Loveday, \'you two go and lie down now and I\'ll bide up; and\r\nas soon as he comes in, which he\'ll do most likely in the course of the\r\nnight, I\'ll let him know that they are coming again.\'\r\n\r\nAnne and Mrs. Loveday went to their bedrooms, and the miller entered the\r\nmill as if he were simply staying up to grind.  But he continually left\r\nthe flour-shoot to go outside and walk round; each time he could see no\r\nliving being near the spot.  Anne meanwhile had lain down dressed upon\r\nher bed, the window still open, her ears intent upon the sound of\r\nfootsteps and dreading the reappearance of daylight and the gang\'s\r\nreturn.  Three or four times during the night she descended to the mill\r\nto inquire of her stepfather if Bob had shown himself; but the answer was\r\nalways in the negative.\r\n\r\nAt length the curtains of her bed began to reveal their pattern, the\r\nbrass handles of the drawers gleamed forth, and day dawned.  While the\r\nlight was yet no more than a suffusion of pallor, she arose, put on her\r\nhat, and determined to explore the surrounding premises before the men\r\narrived.  Emerging into the raw loneliness of the daybreak, she went upon\r\nthe bridge and looked up and down the road.  It was as she had left it,\r\nempty, and the solitude was rendered yet more insistent by the silence of\r\nthe mill-wheel, which was now stopped, the miller having given up\r\nexpecting Bob and retired to bed about three o\'clock.  The footprints of\r\nthe marines still remained in the dust on the bridge, all the heel-marks\r\ntowards the house, showing that the party had not as yet returned.\r\n\r\nWhile she lingered she heard a slight noise in the other direction, and,\r\nturning, saw a woman approaching.  The woman came up quickly, and, to her\r\namazement, Anne recognized Matilda.  Her walk was convulsive, face pale,\r\nalmost haggard, and the cold light of the morning invested it with all\r\nthe ghostliness of death.  She had plainly walked all the way from\r\nBudmouth, for her shoes were covered with dust.\r\n\r\n\'Has the press-gang been here?\' she gasped.  \'If not they are coming!\'\r\n\r\n\'They have been.\'\r\n\r\n\'And got him--I am too late!\'\r\n\r\n\'No; they are coming back again.  Why did you--\'\r\n\r\n\'I came to try to save him.  Can we save him?  Where is he?\'\r\n\r\nAnne looked the woman in the face, and it was impossible to doubt that\r\nshe was in earnest.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know,\' she answered.  \'I am trying to find him before they\r\ncome.\'\r\n\r\n\'Will you not let me help you?\' cried the repentant Matilda.\r\n\r\nWithout either objecting or assenting Anne turned and led the way to the\r\nback part of the homestead.\r\n\r\nMatilda, too, had suffered that night.  From the moment of parting with\r\nFestus Derriman a sentiment of revulsion from the act to which she had\r\nbeen a party set in and increased, till at length it reached an intensity\r\nof remorse which she could not passively bear.  She had risen before day\r\nand hastened thitherward to know the worst, and if possible hinder\r\nconsequences that she had been the first to set in train.\r\n\r\nAfter going hither and thither in the adjoining field, Anne entered the\r\ngarden.  The walks were bathed in grey dew, and as she passed observantly\r\nalong them it appeared as if they had been brushed by some foot at a much\r\nearlier hour.  At the end of the garden, bushes of broom, laurel, and yew\r\nformed a constantly encroaching shrubbery, that had come there almost by\r\nchance, and was never trimmed.  Behind these bushes was a garden-seat,\r\nand upon it lay Bob sound asleep.\r\n\r\nThe ends of his hair were clotted with damp, and there was a foggy film\r\nupon the mirror-like buttons of his coat, and upon the buckles of his\r\nshoes.  His bunch of new gold seals was dimmed by the same insidious\r\ndampness; his shirt-frill and muslin neckcloth were limp as seaweed.  It\r\nwas plain that he had been there a long time.  Anne shook him, but he did\r\nnot awake, his breathing being slow and stertorous.\r\n\r\n\'Bob, wake; \'tis your own Anne!\' she said, with innocent earnestness; and\r\nthen, fearfully turning her head, she saw that Matilda was close behind\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\'You needn\'t mind me,\' said Matilda bitterly.  \'I am on your side now.\r\nShake him again.\'\r\n\r\nAnne shook him again, but he slept on.  Then she noticed that his\r\nforehead bore the mark of a heavy wound.\r\n\r\n\'I fancy I hear something!\' said her companion, starting forward and\r\nendeavouring to wake Bob herself.  \'He is stunned, or drugged!\' she said;\r\n\'there is no rousing him.\'\r\n\r\nAnne raised her head and listened.  From the direction of the eastern\r\nroad came the sound of a steady tramp.  \'They are coming back!\' she said,\r\nclasping her hands.  \'They will take him, ill as he is!  He won\'t open\r\nhis eyes--no, it is no use!  O, what shall we do?\'\r\n\r\nMatilda did not reply, but running to the end of the seat on which Bob\r\nlay, tried its weight in her arms.\r\n\r\n\'It is not too heavy,\' she said.  \'You take that end, and I\'ll take this.\r\nWe\'ll carry him away to some place of hiding.\'\r\n\r\nAnne instantly seized the other end, and they proceeded with their burden\r\nat a slow pace to the lower garden-gate, which they reached as the tread\r\nof the press-gang resounded over the bridge that gave access to the mill\r\ncourt, now hidden from view by the hedge and the trees of the garden.\r\n\r\n\'We will go down inside this field,\' said Anne faintly.\r\n\r\n\'No!\' said the other; \'they will see our foot-tracks in the dew.  We must\r\ngo into the road.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is the very road they will come down when they leave the mill.\'\r\n\r\n\'It cannot be helped; it is neck or nothing with us now.\'\r\n\r\nSo they emerged upon the road, and staggered along without speaking,\r\noccasionally resting for a moment to ease their arms; then shaking him to\r\narouse him, and finding it useless, seizing the seat again.  When they\r\nhad gone about two hundred yards Matilda betrayed signs of exhaustion,\r\nand she asked, \'Is there no shelter near?\'\r\n\r\n\'When we get to that little field of corn,\' said Anne.\r\n\r\n\'It is so very far.  Surely there is some place near?\'\r\n\r\nShe pointed to a few scrubby bushes overhanging a little stream, which\r\npassed under the road near this point.\r\n\r\n\'They are not thick enough,\' said Anne.\r\n\r\n\'Let us take him under the bridge,\' said Matilda.  \'I can go no further.\'\r\n\r\nEntering the opening by which cattle descended to drink, they waded into\r\nthe weedy water, which here rose a few inches above their ankles.  To\r\nascend the stream, stoop under the arch, and reach the centre of the\r\nroadway, was the work of a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\'If they look under the arch we are lost,\' murmured Anne.\r\n\r\n\'There is no parapet to the bridge, and they may pass over without\r\nheeding.\'\r\n\r\nThey waited, their heads almost in contact with the reeking arch, and\r\ntheir feet encircled by the stream, which was at its summer lowness now.\r\nFor some minutes they could hear nothing but the babble of the water over\r\ntheir ankles, and round the legs of the seat on which Bob slumbered, the\r\nsounds being reflected in a musical tinkle from the hollow sides of the\r\narch.  Anne\'s anxiety now was lest he should not continue sleeping till\r\nthe search was over, but start up with his habitual imprudence, and\r\nscorning such means of safety, rush out into their arms.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour dragged by, and then indications reached their ears\r\nthat the re-examination of the mill had begun and ended.  The well-known\r\ntramp drew nearer, and reverberated through the ground over their heads,\r\nwhere its volume signified to the listeners that the party had been\r\nlargely augmented by pressed men since the night preceding.  The gang\r\npassed the arch, and the noise regularly diminished, as if no man among\r\nthem had thought of looking aside for a moment.\r\n\r\nMatilda broke the silence.  \'I wonder if they have left a watch behind?\'\r\nshe said doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\'I will go and see,\' said Anne.  \'Wait till I return.\'\r\n\r\n\'No; I can do no more.  When you come back I shall be gone.  I ask one\r\nthing of you.  If all goes well with you and him, and he marries\r\nyou--don\'t be alarmed; my plans lie elsewhere--when you are his wife tell\r\nhim who helped to carry him away.  But don\'t mention my name to the rest\r\nof your family, either now or at any time.\'\r\n\r\nAnne regarded the speaker for a moment, and promised; after which she\r\nwaded out from the archway.\r\n\r\nMatilda stood looking at Bob for a moment, as if preparing to go, till\r\nmoved by some impulse she bent and lightly kissed him once.\r\n\r\n\'How can you!\' cried Anne reproachfully.  When leaving the mouth of the\r\narch she had bent back and seen the act.\r\n\r\nMatilda flushed.  \'You jealous baby!\' she said scornfully.\r\n\r\nAnne hesitated for a moment, then went out from the water, and hastened\r\ntowards the mill.\r\n\r\nShe entered by the garden, and, seeing no one, advanced and peeped in at\r\nthe window.  Her mother and Mr. Loveday were sitting within as usual.\r\n\r\n\'Are they all gone?\' said Anne softly.\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  They did not trouble us much, beyond going into every room, and\r\nsearching about the garden, where they saw steps.  They have been lucky\r\nto-night; they have caught fifteen or twenty men at places further on; so\r\nthe loss of Bob was no hurt to their feelings.  I wonder where in the\r\nworld the poor fellow is!\'\r\n\r\n\'I will show you,\' said Anne.  And explaining in a few words what had\r\nhappened, she was promptly followed by David and Loveday along the road.\r\nShe lifted her dress and entered the arch with some anxiety on account of\r\nMatilda; but the actress was gone, and Bob lay on the seat as she had\r\nleft him.\r\n\r\nBob was brought out, and water thrown upon his face; but though he moved\r\nhe did not rouse himself until some time after he had been borne into the\r\nhouse.  Here he opened his eyes, and saw them standing round, and\r\ngathered a little consciousness.\r\n\r\n\'You are all right, my boy!\' said his father.  \'What hev happened to ye?\r\nWhere did ye get that terrible blow?\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah--I can mind now,\' murmured Bob, with a stupefied gaze around.  \'I\r\nfell in slipping down the topsail halyard--the rope, that is, was too\r\nshort--and I fell upon my head.  And then I went away.  When I came back\r\nI thought I wouldn\'t disturb ye: so I lay down out there, to sleep out\r\nthe watch; but the pain in my head was so great that I couldn\'t get to\r\nsleep; so I picked some of the poppy-heads in the border, which I once\r\nheard was a good thing for sending folks to sleep when they are in pain.\r\nSo I munched up all I could find, and dropped off quite nicely.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wondered who had picked \'em!\' said Molly.  \'I noticed they were gone.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, you might never have woke again!\' said Mrs. Loveday, holding up her\r\nhands.  \'How is your head now?\'\r\n\r\n\'I hardly know,\' replied the young man, putting his hand to his forehead\r\nand beginning to doze again.  \'Where be those fellows that boarded us?\r\nWith this--smooth water and--fine breeze we ought to get away from \'em.\r\nHaul in--the larboard braces, and--bring her to the wind.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are at home, dear Bob,\' said Anne, bending over him, \'and the men\r\nare gone.\'\r\n\r\n\'Come along upstairs: th\' beest hardly awake now,\' said his father and\r\nBob was assisted to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII.  A DISCOVERY TURNS THE SCALE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn four-and-twenty hours Bob had recovered.  But though physically\r\nhimself again, he was not at all sure of his position as a patriot.  He\r\nhad that practical knowledge of seamanship of which the country stood\r\nmuch in need, and it was humiliating to find that impressment seemed to\r\nbe necessary to teach him to use it for her advantage.  Many neighbouring\r\nyoung men, less fortunate than himself, had been pressed and taken; and\r\ntheir absence seemed a reproach to him.  He went away by himself into the\r\nmill-roof, and, surrounded by the corn-heaps, gave vent to\r\nself-condemnation.\r\n\r\n\'Certainly, I am no man to lie here so long for the pleasure of sighting\r\nthat young girl forty times a day, and letting her sight me--bless her\r\neyes!--till I must needs want a press-gang to teach me what I\'ve forgot.\r\nAnd is it then all over with me as a British sailor?  We\'ll see.\'\r\n\r\nWhen he was thrown under the influence of Anne\'s eyes again, which were\r\nmore tantalizingly beautiful than ever just now (so it seemed to him),\r\nhis intention of offering his services to the Government would wax\r\nweaker, and he would put off his final decision till the next day.  Anne\r\nsaw these fluctuations of his mind between love and patriotism, and being\r\nterrified by what she had heard of sea-fights, used the utmost art of\r\nwhich she was capable to seduce him from his forming purpose.  She came\r\nto him in the mill, wearing the very prettiest of her morning jackets--the\r\none that only just passed the waist, and was laced so tastefully round\r\nthe collar and bosom.  Then she would appear in her new hat, with a\r\nbouquet of primroses on one side; and on the following Sunday she walked\r\nbefore him in lemon-coloured boots, so that her feet looked like a pair\r\nof yellow-hammers flitting under her dress.\r\n\r\nBut dress was the least of the means she adopted for chaining him down.\r\nShe talked more tenderly than ever; asked him to begin small undertakings\r\nin the garden on her account; she sang about the house, that the place\r\nmight seem cheerful when he came in.  This singing for a purpose required\r\ngreat effort on her part, leaving her afterwards very sad.  When Bob\r\nasked her what was the matter, she would say, \'Nothing; only I am\r\nthinking how you will grieve your father, and cross his purposes, if you\r\ncarry out your unkind notion of going to sea, and forsaking your place in\r\nthe mill.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' Bob would say uneasily.  \'It will trouble him, I know.\'\r\n\r\nBeing also quite aware how it would trouble her, he would again postpone,\r\nand thus another week passed away.\r\n\r\nAll this time John had not come once to the mill.  It appeared as if Miss\r\nJohnson absorbed all his time and thoughts.  Bob was often seen chuckling\r\nover the circumstance.  \'A sly rascal!\' he said.  \'Pretending on the day\r\nshe came to be married that she was not good enough for me, when it was\r\nonly that he wanted her for himself.  How he could have persuaded her to\r\ngo away is beyond me to say!\'\r\n\r\nAnne could not contest this belief of her lover\'s, and remained silent;\r\nbut there had more than once occurred to her mind a doubt of its\r\nprobability.  Yet she had only abandoned her opinion that John had\r\nschemed for Matilda, to embrace the opposite error; that, finding he had\r\nwronged the young lady, he had pitied and grown to love her.\r\n\r\n\'And yet Jack, when he was a boy, was the simplest fellow alive,\' resumed\r\nBob.  \'By George, though, I should have been hot against him for such a\r\ntrick, if in losing her I hadn\'t found a better!  But she\'ll never come\r\ndown to him in the world: she has high notions now.  I am afraid he\'s\r\ndoomed to sigh in vain!\'\r\n\r\nThough Bob regretted this possibility, the feeling was not reciprocated\r\nby Anne.  It was true that she knew nothing of Matilda\'s temporary\r\ntreachery, and that she disbelieved the story of her lack of virtue; but\r\nshe did not like the woman.  \'Perhaps it will not matter if he is doomed\r\nto sigh in vain,\' she said.  \'But I owe him no ill-will.  I have profited\r\nby his doings, incomprehensible as they are.\'  And she bent her fair eyes\r\non Bob and smiled.\r\n\r\nBob looked dubious.  \'He thinks he has affronted me, now I have seen\r\nthrough him, and that I shall be against meeting him.  But, of course, I\r\nam not so touchy.  I can stand a practical joke, as can any man who has\r\nbeen afloat.  I\'ll call and see him, and tell him so.\'\r\n\r\nBefore he started, Bob bethought him of something which would still\r\nfurther prove to the misapprehending John that he was entirely forgiven.\r\nHe went to his room, and took from his chest a packet containing a lock\r\nof Miss Johnson\'s hair, which she had given him during their brief\r\nacquaintance, and which till now he had quite forgotten.  When, at\r\nstarting, he wished Anne goodbye, it was accompanied by such a beaming\r\nface, that she knew he was full of an idea, and asked what it might be\r\nthat pleased him so.\r\n\r\n\'Why, this,\' he said, smacking his breast-pocket.  \'A lock of hair that\r\nMatilda gave me.\'\r\n\r\nAnne sank back with parted lips.\r\n\r\n\'I am going to give it to Jack--he\'ll jump for joy to get it!  And it\r\nwill show him how willing I am to give her up to him, fine piece as she\r\nis.\'\r\n\r\n\'Will you see her to-day, Bob?\' Anne asked with an uncertain smile.\r\n\r\n\'O no--unless it is by accident.\'\r\n\r\nOn reaching the outskirts of the town he went straight to the barracks,\r\nand was lucky enough to find John in his room, at the left-hand corner of\r\nthe quadrangle.  John was glad to see him; but to Bob\'s surprise he\r\nshowed no immediate contrition, and thus afforded no room for the\r\nbrotherly speech of forgiveness which Bob had been going to deliver.  As\r\nthe trumpet-major did not open the subject, Bob felt it desirable to\r\nbegin himself.\r\n\r\n\'I have brought ye something that you will value, Jack,\' he said, as they\r\nsat at the window, overlooking the large square barrack-yard.  \'I have\r\ngot no further use for it, and you should have had it before if it had\r\nentered my head.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, Bob; what is it?\' said John, looking absently at an awkward\r\nsquad of young men who were drilling in the enclosure.\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis a young woman\'s lock of hair.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah!\' said John, quite recovering from his abstraction, and slightly\r\nflushing.  Could Bob and Anne have quarrelled?  Bob drew the paper from\r\nhis pocket, and opened it.\r\n\r\n\'Black!\' said John.\r\n\r\n\'Yes--black enough.\'\r\n\r\n\'Whose?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, Matilda\'s.\'\r\n\r\n\'O, Matilda\'s!\'\r\n\r\n\'Whose did you think then?\'\r\n\r\nInstead of replying, the trumpet-major\'s face became as red as sunset,\r\nand he turned to the window to hide his confusion.\r\n\r\nBob was silent, and then he, too, looked into the court.  At length he\r\narose, walked to his brother, and laid his hand upon his shoulder.\r\n\'Jack,\' he said, in an altered voice, \'you are a good fellow.  Now I see\r\nit all.\'\r\n\r\n\'O no--that\'s nothing,\' said John hastily.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ve been pretending that you care for this woman that I mightn\'t\r\nblame myself for heaving you out from the other--which is what I\'ve done\r\nwithout knowing it.\'\r\n\r\n\'What does it matter?\'\r\n\r\n\'But it does matter!  I\'ve been making you unhappy all these weeks and\r\nweeks through my thoughtlessness.  They seemed to think at home, you\r\nknow, John, that you had grown not to care for her; or I wouldn\'t have\r\ndone it for all the world!\'\r\n\r\n\'You stick to her, Bob, and never mind me.  She belongs to you.  She\r\nloves you.  I have no claim upon her, and she thinks nothing about me.\'\r\n\r\n\'She likes you, John, thoroughly well; so does everybody; and if I hadn\'t\r\ncome home, putting my foot in it--  That coming home of mine has been a\r\nregular blight upon the family!  I ought never to have stayed.  The sea\r\nis my home, and why couldn\'t I bide there?\'\r\n\r\nThe trumpet-major drew Bob\'s discourse off the subject as soon as he\r\ncould, and Bob, after some unconsidered replies and remarks, seemed\r\nwilling to avoid it for the present.  He did not ask John to accompany\r\nhim home, as he had intended; and on leaving the barracks turned\r\nsouthward and entered the town to wander about till he could decide what\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nIt was the 3rd of September, but the King\'s watering-place still retained\r\nits summer aspect.  The royal bathing-machine had been drawn out just as\r\nBob reached Gloucester Buildings, and he waited a minute, in the lack of\r\nother distraction, to look on.  Immediately that the King\'s machine had\r\nentered the water a group of florid men with fiddles, violoncellos, a\r\ntrombone, and a drum, came forward, packed themselves into another\r\nmachine that was in waiting, and were drawn out into the waves in the\r\nKing\'s rear.  All that was to be heard for a few minutes were the slow\r\npulsations of the sea; and then a deafening noise burst from the interior\r\nof the second machine with power enough to split the boards asunder; it\r\nwas the condensed mass of musicians inside, striking up the strains of\r\n\'God save the King,\' as his Majesty\'s head rose from the water.  Bob took\r\noff his hat and waited till the end of the performance, which, intended\r\nas a pleasant surprise to George III. by the loyal burghers, was possibly\r\nin the watery circumstances tolerated rather than desired by that\r\ndripping monarch. {303}\r\n\r\nLoveday then passed on to the harbour, where he remained awhile, looking\r\nat the busy scene of loading and unloading craft and swabbing the decks\r\nof yachts; at the boats and barges rubbing against the quay wall, and at\r\nthe houses of the merchants, some ancient structures of solid stone,\r\nothers green-shuttered with heavy wooden bow-windows which appeared as if\r\nabout to drop into the harbour by their own weight.  All these things he\r\ngazed upon, and thought of one thing--that he had caused great misery to\r\nhis brother John.\r\n\r\nThe town clock struck, and Bob retraced his steps till he again\r\napproached the Esplanade and Gloucester Lodge, where the morning sun\r\nblazed in upon the house fronts, and not a spot of shade seemed to be\r\nattainable.  A huzzaing attracted his attention, and he observed that a\r\nnumber of people had gathered before the King\'s residence, where a brown\r\ncurricle had stopped, out of which stepped a hale man in the prime of\r\nlife, wearing a blue uniform, gilt epaulettes, cocked hat, and sword, who\r\ncrossed the pavement and went in.  Bob went up and joined the group.\r\n\'What\'s going on?\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'Captain Hardy,\' replied a bystander.\r\n\r\n\'What of him?\'\r\n\r\n\'Just gone in--waiting to see the King.\'\r\n\r\n\'But the captain is in the West Indies?\'\r\n\r\n\'No.  The fleet is come home; they can\'t find the French anywhere.\'\r\n\r\n\'Will they go and look for them again?\' asked Bob.\r\n\r\n\'O yes.  Nelson is determined to find \'em.  As soon as he\'s refitted\r\nhe\'ll put to sea again.  Ah, here\'s the King coming in.\'\r\n\r\nBob was so interested in what he had just heard that he scarcely noticed\r\nthe arrival of the King, and a body of attendant gentlemen.  He went on\r\nthinking of his new knowledge; Captain Hardy was come.  He was doubtless\r\nstaying with his family at their small manor-house at Pos\'ham, a few\r\nmiles from Overcombe, where he usually spent the intervals between his\r\ndifferent cruises.\r\n\r\nLoveday returned to the mill without further delay; and shortly\r\nexplaining that John was very well, and would come soon, went on to talk\r\nof the arrival of Nelson\'s captain.\r\n\r\n\'And is he come at last?\' said the miller, throwing his thoughts years\r\nbackward.  \'Well can I mind when he first left home to go on board the\r\nHelena as midshipman!\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s not much to remember.  I can remember it too,\' said Mrs. Loveday.\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis more than twenty years ago anyhow.  And more than that, I can mind\r\nwhen he was born; I was a lad, serving my \'prenticeship at the time.  He\r\nhas been in this house often and often when \'a was young.  When he came\r\nhome after his first voyage he stayed about here a long time, and used to\r\nlook in at the mill whenever he went past.  "What will you be next, sir?"\r\nsaid mother to him one day as he stood with his back to the doorpost.  "A\r\nlieutenant, Dame Loveday," says he.  "And what next?" says she.  "A\r\ncommander."  "And next?"  "Next, post-captain."  "And then?"  "Then it\r\nwill be almost time to die."  I\'d warrant that he\'d mind it to this very\r\nday if you were to ask him.\'\r\n\r\nBob heard all this with a manner of preoccupation, and soon retired to\r\nthe mill.  Thence he went to his room by the back passage, and taking his\r\nold seafaring garments from a dark closet in the wall conveyed them to\r\nthe loft at the top of the mill, where he occupied the remaining spare\r\nmoments of the day in brushing the mildew from their folds, and hanging\r\neach article by the window to get aired.  In the evening he returned to\r\nthe loft, and dressing himself in the old salt suit, went out of the\r\nhouse unobserved by anybody, and ascended the road towards Captain\r\nHardy\'s native village and present temporary home.\r\n\r\nThe shadeless downs were now brown with the droughts of the passing\r\nsummer, and few living things met his view, the natural rotundity of the\r\nelevation being only occasionally disturbed by the presence of a barrow,\r\na thorn-bush, or a piece of dry wall which remained from some attempted\r\nenclosure.  By the time that he reached the village it was dark, and the\r\nlarger stars had begun to shine when he walked up to the door of the old-\r\nfashioned house which was the family residence of this branch of the\r\nSouth-Wessex Hardys.\r\n\r\n\'Will the captain allow me to wait on him to-night?\' inquired Loveday,\r\nexplaining who and what he was.\r\n\r\nThe servant went away for a few minutes, and then told Bob that he might\r\nsee the captain in the morning.\r\n\r\n\'If that\'s the case, I\'ll come again,\' replied Bob, quite cheerful that\r\nfailure was not absolute.\r\n\r\nHe had left the door but a few steps when he was called back and asked if\r\nhe had walked all the way from Overcombe Mill on purpose.\r\n\r\nLoveday replied modestly that he had done so.\r\n\r\n\'Then will you come in?\'  He followed the speaker into a small study or\r\noffice, and in a minute or two Captain Hardy entered.\r\n\r\nThe captain at this time was a bachelor of thirty-five, rather stout in\r\nbuild, with light eyes, bushy eyebrows, a square broad face, plenty of\r\nchin, and a mouth whose corners played between humour and grimness.  He\r\nsurveyed Loveday from top to toe.\r\n\r\n\'Robert Loveday, sir, son of the miller at Overcombe,\' said Bob, making a\r\nlow bow.\r\n\r\n\'Ah!  I remember your father, Loveday,\' the gallant seaman replied.\r\n\'Well, what do you want to say to me?\'  Seeing that Bob found it rather\r\ndifficult to begin, he leant leisurely against the mantelpiece, and went\r\non, \'Is your father well and hearty?  I have not seen him for many, many\r\nyears.\'\r\n\r\n\'Quite well, thank \'ee.\'\r\n\r\n\'You used to have a brother in the army, I think?  What was his\r\nname--John?  A very fine fellow, if I recollect.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, cap\'n; he\'s there still.\'\r\n\r\n\'And you are in the merchant-service?\'\r\n\r\n\'Late first mate of the brig Pewit.\'\r\n\r\n\'How is it you\'re not on board a man-of-war?\'\r\n\r\n\'Ay, sir, that\'s the thing I\'ve come about,\' said Bob, recovering\r\nconfidence.  \'I should have been, but \'tis womankind has hampered me.\r\nI\'ve waited and waited on at home because of a young woman--lady, I might\r\nhave said, for she\'s sprung from a higher class of society than I.  Her\r\nfather was a landscape painter--maybe you\'ve heard of him, sir?  The name\r\nis Garland.\'\r\n\r\n\'He painted that view of our village here,\' said Captain Hardy, looking\r\ntowards a dark little picture in the corner of the room.\r\n\r\nBob looked, and went on, as if to the picture, \'Well, sir, I have found\r\nthat--  However, the press-gang came a week or two ago, and didn\'t get\r\nhold of me.  I didn\'t care to go aboard as a pressed man.\'\r\n\r\n\'There has been a severe impressment.  It is of course a disagreeable\r\nnecessity, but it can\'t be helped.\'\r\n\r\n\'Since then, sir, something has happened that makes me wish they had\r\nfound me, and I have come to-night to ask if I could enter on board your\r\nship the Victory.\'\r\n\r\nThe captain shook his head severely, and presently observed: \'I am glad\r\nto find that you think of entering the service, Loveday; smart men are\r\nbadly wanted.  But it will not be in your power to choose your ship.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, well, sir; then I must take my chance elsewhere,\' said Bob, his\r\nface indicating the disappointment he would not fully express.  \'\'Twas\r\nonly that I felt I would much rather serve under you than anybody else,\r\nmy father and all of us being known to ye, Captain Hardy, and our\r\nfamilies belonging to the same parts.\'\r\n\r\nCaptain Hardy took Bob\'s altitude more carefully.  \'Are you a good\r\npractical seaman?\' he asked musingly.\r\n\r\n\'Ay, sir; I believe I am.\'\r\n\r\n\'Active?  Fond of skylarking?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I don\'t know about the last.  I think I can say I am active\r\nenough.  I could walk the yard-arm, if required, cross from mast to mast\r\nby the stays, and do what most fellows do who call themselves spry.\'\r\n\r\nThe captain then put some questions about the details of navigation,\r\nwhich Loveday, having luckily been used to square rigs, answered\r\nsatisfactorily.  \'As to reefing topsails,\' he added, \'if I don\'t do it\r\nlike a flash of lightning, I can do it so that they will stand blowing\r\nweather.  The Pewit was not a dull vessel, and when we were convoyed home\r\nfrom Lisbon, she could keep well in sight of the frigate scudding at a\r\ndistance, by putting on full sail.  We had enough hands aboard to reef\r\ntopsails man-o\'-war fashion, which is a rare thing in these days, sir,\r\nnow that able seamen are so scarce on trading craft.  And I hear that men\r\nfrom square-rigged vessels are liked much the best in the navy, as being\r\nmore ready for use?  So that I shouldn\'t be altogether so raw,\' said Bob\r\nearnestly, \'if I could enter on your ship, sir.  Still, if I can\'t, I\r\ncan\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'I might ask for you, Loveday,\' said the captain thoughtfully, \'and so\r\nget you there that way.  In short, I think I may say I will ask for you.\r\nSo consider it settled.\'\r\n\r\n\'My thanks to you, sir,\' said Loveday.\r\n\r\n\'You are aware that the Victory is a smart ship, and that cleanliness and\r\norder are, of necessity, more strictly insisted upon there than in some\r\nothers?\'\r\n\r\n\'Sir, I quite see it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I hope you will do your duty as well on a line-of-battle ship as\r\nyou did when mate of the brig, for it is a duty that may be serious.\'\r\n\r\nBob replied that it should be his one endeavour; and receiving a few\r\ninstructions for getting on board the guard-ship, and being conveyed to\r\nPortsmouth, he turned to go away.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll have a stiff walk before you fetch Overcombe Mill this dark\r\nnight, Loveday,\' concluded the captain, peering out of the window.  \'I\'ll\r\nsend you in a glass of grog to help \'ee on your way.\'\r\n\r\nThe captain then left Bob to himself, and when he had drunk the grog that\r\nwas brought in he started homeward, with a heart not exactly light, but\r\nlarge with a patriotic cheerfulness, which had not diminished when, after\r\nwalking so fast in his excitement as to be beaded with perspiration, he\r\nentered his father\'s door.\r\n\r\nThey were all sitting up for him, and at his approach anxiously raised\r\ntheir sleepy eyes, for it was nearly eleven o\'clock.\r\n\r\n\'There; I knew he\'d not be much longer!\' cried Anne, jumping up and\r\nlaughing, in her relief.  \'They have been thinking you were very strange\r\nand silent to-day, Bob; you were not, were you?\'\r\n\r\n\'What\'s the matter, Bob?\' said the miller; for Bob\'s countenance was\r\nsublimed by his recent interview, like that of a priest just come from\r\nthe penetralia of the temple.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s in his mate\'s clothes, just as when he came home!\' observed Mrs.\r\nLoveday.\r\n\r\nThey all saw now that he had something to tell.  \'I am going away,\' he\r\nsaid when he had sat down.  \'I am going to enter on board a man-of-war,\r\nand perhaps it will be the Victory.\'\r\n\r\n\'Going?\' said Anne faintly.\r\n\r\n\'Now, don\'t you mind it, there\'s a dear,\' he went on solemnly, taking her\r\nhand in his own.  \'And you, father, don\'t you begin to take it to heart\'\r\n(the miller was looking grave).  \'The press-gang has been here, and\r\nthough I showed them that I was a free man, I am going to show everybody\r\nthat I can do my duty.\'\r\n\r\nNeither of the other three answered, Anne and the miller having their\r\neyes bent upon the ground, and the former trying to repress her tears.\r\n\r\n\'Now don\'t you grieve, either of you,\' he continued; \'nor vex yourselves\r\nthat this has happened.  Please not to be angry with me, father, for\r\ndeserting you and the mill, where you want me, for I _must go_.  For\r\nthese three years we and the rest of the country have been in fear of the\r\nenemy; trade has been hindered; poor folk made hungry; and many rich folk\r\nmade poor.  There must be a deliverance, and it must be done by sea.  I\r\nhave seen Captain Hardy, and I shall serve under him if so be I can.\'\r\n\r\n\'Captain Hardy?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  I have been to his house at Pos\'ham, where he\'s staying with his\r\nsisters; walked there and back, and I wouldn\'t have missed it for fifty\r\nguineas.  I hardly thought he would see me; but he did see me.  And he\r\nhasn\'t forgot you.\'\r\n\r\nBob then opened his tale in order, relating graphically the conversation\r\nto which he had been a party, and they listened with breathless\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\'Well, if you must go, you must,\' said the miller with emotion; \'but I\r\nthink it somewhat hard that, of my two sons, neither one of \'em can be\r\ngot to stay and help me in my business as I get old.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t trouble and vex about it,\' said Mrs. Loveday soothingly.  \'They\r\nare both instruments in the hands of Providence, chosen to chastise that\r\nCorsican ogre, and do what they can for the country in these trying\r\nyears.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s just the shape of it, Mrs. Loveday,\' said Bob.\r\n\r\n\'And he\'ll come back soon,\' she continued, turning to Anne.  \'And then\r\nhe\'ll tell us all he has seen, and the glory that he\'s won, and how he\r\nhas helped to sweep that scourge Buonaparty off the earth.\'\r\n\r\n\'When be you going, Bob?\' his father inquired.\r\n\r\n\'To-morrow, if I can.  I shall call at the barracks and tell John as I go\r\nby.  When I get to Portsmouth--\'\r\n\r\nA burst of sobs in quick succession interrupted his words; they came from\r\nAnne, who till that moment had been sitting as before with her hand in\r\nthat of Bob, and apparently quite calm.  Mrs. Loveday jumped up, but\r\nbefore she could say anything to soothe the agitated girl she had calmed\r\nherself with the same singular suddenness that had marked her giving way.\r\n\'I don\'t mind Bob\'s going,\' she said.  \'I think he ought to go.  Don\'t\r\nsuppose, Bob, that I want you to stay!\'\r\n\r\nAfter this she left the apartment, and went into the little side room\r\nwhere she and her mother usually worked.  In a few moments Bob followed\r\nher.  When he came back he was in a very sad and emotional mood.  Anybody\r\ncould see that there had been a parting of profound anguish to both.\r\n\r\n\'She is not coming back to-night,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'You will see her to-morrow before you go?\' said her mother.\r\n\r\n\'I may or I may not,\' he replied.  \'Father and Mrs. Loveday, do you go to\r\nbed now.  I have got to look over my things and get ready; and it will\r\ntake me some little time.  If you should hear noises you will know it is\r\nonly myself moving about.\'\r\n\r\nWhen Bob was left alone he suddenly became brisk, and set himself to\r\noverhaul his clothes and other possessions in a business-like manner.  By\r\nthe time that his chest was packed, such things as he meant to leave at\r\nhome folded into cupboards, and what was useless destroyed, it was past\r\ntwo o\'clock.  Then he went to bed, so softly that only the creak of one\r\nweak stair revealed his passage upward.  At the moment that he passed\r\nAnne\'s chamber-door her mother was bending over her as she lay in bed,\r\nand saying to her, \'Won\'t you see him in the morning?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no,\' said Anne.  \'I would rather not see him!  I have said that I\r\nmay.  But I shall not.  I cannot see him again!\'\r\n\r\nWhen the family got up next day Bob had vanished.  It was his way to\r\ndisappear like this, to avoid affecting scenes at parting.  By the time\r\nthat they had sat down to a gloomy breakfast, Bob was in the boat of a\r\nBudmouth waterman, who pulled him alongside the guardship in the roads,\r\nwhere he laid hold of the man-rope, mounted, and disappeared from\r\nexternal view.  In the course of the day the ship moved off, set her\r\nroyals, and made sail for Portsmouth, with five hundred new hands for the\r\nservice on board, consisting partly of pressed men and partly of\r\nvolunteers, among the latter being Robert Loveday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV.  A SPECK ON THE SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn parting from John, who accompanied him to the quay, Bob had said:\r\n\'Now, Jack, these be my last words to you: I give her up.  I go away on\r\npurpose, and I shall be away a long time.  If in that time she should\r\nlist over towards ye ever so little, mind you take her.  You have more\r\nright to her than I.  You chose her when my mind was elsewhere, and you\r\nbest deserve her; for I have never known you forget one woman, while I\'ve\r\nforgot a dozen.  Take her then, if she will come, and God bless both of\r\nye.\'\r\n\r\nAnother person besides John saw Bob go.  That was Derriman, who was\r\nstanding by a bollard a little further up the quay.  He did not repress\r\nhis satisfaction at the sight.  John looked towards him with an open gaze\r\nof contempt; for the cuffs administered to the yeoman at the inn had not,\r\nso far as the trumpet-major was aware, produced any desire to avenge that\r\ninsult, John being, of course, quite ignorant that Festus had erroneously\r\nretaliated upon Bob, in his peculiar though scarcely soldierly way.\r\nFinding that he did not even now approach him, John went on his way, and\r\nthought over his intention of preserving intact the love between Anne and\r\nhis brother.\r\n\r\nHe was surprised when he next went to the mill to find how glad they all\r\nwere to see him.  From the moment of Bob\'s return to the bosom of the\r\ndeep Anne had had no existence on land; people might have looked at her\r\nhuman body and said she had flitted thence.  The sea and all that\r\nbelonged to the sea was her daily thought and her nightly dream.  She had\r\nthe whole two-and-thirty winds under her eye, each passing gale that\r\nushered in returning autumn being mentally registered; and she acquired a\r\nprecise knowledge of the direction in which Portsmouth, Brest, Ferrol,\r\nCadiz, and other such likely places lay.  Instead of saying her own\r\nfamiliar prayers at night she substituted, with some confusion of\r\nthought, the Forms of Prayer to be used at sea.  John at once noticed her\r\nlorn, abstracted looks, pitied her,--how much he pitied her!--and asked\r\nwhen they were alone if there was anything he could do.\r\n\r\n\'There are two things,\' she said, with almost childish eagerness in her\r\ntired eyes.\r\n\r\n\'They shall be done.\'\r\n\r\n\'The first is to find out if Captain Hardy has gone back to his ship; and\r\nthe other is--O if you will do it, John!--to get me newspapers whenever\r\npossible.\'\r\n\r\nAfter this duologue John was absent for a space of three hours, and they\r\nthought he had gone back to barracks.  He entered, however, at the end of\r\nthat time, took off his forage-cap, and wiped his forehead.\r\n\r\n\'You look tired, John,\' said his father.\r\n\r\n\'O no.\'  He went through the house till he had found Anne Garland.\r\n\r\n\'I have only done one of those things,\' he said to her.\r\n\r\n\'What, already!  I didn\'t hope for or mean to-day.\'\r\n\r\n\'Captain Hardy is gone from Pos\'ham.  He left some days ago.  We shall\r\nsoon hear that the fleet has sailed.\'\r\n\r\n\'You have been all the way to Pos\'ham on purpose?  How good of you!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I was anxious to know myself when Bob is likely to leave.  I\r\nexpect now that we shall soon hear from him.\'\r\n\r\nTwo days later he came again.  He brought a newspaper, and what was\r\nbetter, a letter for Anne, franked by the first lieutenant of the\r\nVictory.\r\n\r\n\'Then he\'s aboard her,\' said Anne, as she eagerly took the letter.\r\n\r\nIt was short, but as much as she could expect in the circumstances, and\r\ninformed them that the captain had been as good as his word, and had\r\ngratified Bob\'s earnest wish to serve under him.  The ship, with Admiral\r\nLord Nelson on board, and accompanied by the frigate Euryalus, was to\r\nsail in two days for Plymouth, where they would be joined by others, and\r\nthence proceed to the coast of Spain.\r\n\r\nAnne lay awake that night thinking of the Victory, and of those who\r\nfloated in her.  To the best of Anne\'s calculation that ship of war\r\nwould, during the next twenty-four hours, pass within a few miles of\r\nwhere she herself then lay.  Next to seeing Bob, the thing that would\r\ngive her more pleasure than any other in the world was to see the vessel\r\nthat contained him--his floating city, his sole dependence in battle and\r\nstorm--upon whose safety from winds and enemies hung all her hope.\r\n\r\nThe morrow was market-day at the seaport, and in this she saw her\r\nopportunity.  A carrier went from Overcombe at six o\'clock thither, and\r\nhaving to do a little shopping for herself she gave it as a reason for\r\nher intended day\'s absence, and took a place in the van.  When she\r\nreached the town it was still early morning, but the borough was already\r\nin the zenith of its daily bustle and show.  The King was always out-of-\r\ndoors by six o\'clock, and such cock-crow hours at Gloucester Lodge\r\nproduced an equally forward stir among the population.  She alighted, and\r\npassed down the esplanade, as fully thronged by persons of fashion at\r\nthis time of mist and level sunlight as a watering-place in the present\r\nday is at four in the afternoon.  Dashing bucks and beaux in cocked hats,\r\nblack feathers, ruffles, and frills, stared at her as she hurried along;\r\nthe beach was swarming with bathing women, wearing waistbands that bore\r\nthe national refrain, \'God save the King,\' in gilt letters; the shops\r\nwere all open, and Sergeant Stanner, with his sword-stuck bank-notes and\r\nheroic gaze, was beating up at two guineas and a crown, the crown to\r\ndrink his Majesty\'s health.\r\n\r\nShe soon finished her shopping, and then, crossing over into the old\r\ntown, pursued her way along the coast-road to Portland.  At the end of an\r\nhour she had been rowed across the Fleet (which then lacked the\r\nconvenience of a bridge), and reached the base of Portland Hill.  The\r\nsteep incline before her was dotted with houses, showing the pleasant\r\npeculiarity of one man\'s doorstep being behind his neighbour\'s chimney,\r\nand slabs of stone as the common material for walls, roof, floor, pig-\r\nsty, stable-manger, door-scraper, and garden-stile.  Anne gained the\r\nsummit, and followed along the central track over the huge lump of\r\nfreestone which forms the peninsula, the wide sea prospect extending as\r\nshe went on.  Weary with her journey, she approached the extreme\r\nsoutherly peak of rock, and gazed from the cliff at Portland Bill, or\r\nBeal, as it was in those days more correctly called.\r\n\r\nThe wild, herbless, weather-worn promontory was quite a solitude, and,\r\nsaving the one old lighthouse about fifty yards up the slope, scarce a\r\nmark was visible to show that humanity had ever been near the spot.  Anne\r\nfound herself a seat on a stone, and swept with her eyes the tremulous\r\nexpanse of water around her that seemed to utter a ceaseless\r\nunintelligible incantation.  Out of the three hundred and sixty degrees\r\nof her complete horizon two hundred and fifty were covered by waves, the\r\ncoup d\'oeil including the area of troubled waters known as the Race,\r\nwhere two seas met to effect the destruction of such vessels as could not\r\nbe mastered by one.  She counted the craft within her view: there were\r\nfive; no, there were only four; no, there were seven, some of the specks\r\nhaving resolved themselves into two.  They were all small coasters, and\r\nkept well within sight of land.\r\n\r\nAnne sank into a reverie.  Then she heard a slight noise on her left\r\nhand, and turning beheld an old sailor, who had approached with a glass.\r\nHe was levelling it over the sea in a direction to the south-east, and\r\nsomewhat removed from that in which her own eyes had been wandering.  Anne\r\nmoved a few steps thitherward, so as to unclose to her view a deeper\r\nsweep on that side, and by this discovered a ship of far larger size than\r\nany which had yet dotted the main before her.  Its sails were for the\r\nmost part new and clean, and in comparison with its rapid progress before\r\nthe wind the small brigs and ketches seemed standing still.  Upon this\r\nstriking object the old man\'s glass was bent.\r\n\r\n\'What do you see, sailor?\' she asked.\r\n\r\n\'Almost nothing,\' he answered.  \'My sight is so gone off lately that\r\nthings, one and all, be but a November mist to me.  And yet I fain would\r\nsee to-day.  I am looking for the Victory.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why,\' she said quickly.\r\n\r\n\'I have a son aboard her.  He\'s one of three from these parts.  There\'s\r\nthe captain, there\'s my son Ned, and there\'s young Loveday of\r\nOvercombe--he that lately joined.\'\r\n\r\n\'Shall I look for you?\' said Anne, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\'Certainly, mis\'ess, if so be you please.\'\r\n\r\nAnne took the glass, and he supported it by his arm.  \'It is a large\r\nship,\' she said, \'with three masts, three rows of guns along the side,\r\nand all her sails set.\'\r\n\r\n\'I guessed as much.\'\r\n\r\n\'There is a little flag in front--over her bowsprit.\'\r\n\r\n\'The jack.\'\r\n\r\n\'And there\'s a large one flying at her stern.\'\r\n\r\n\'The ensign.\'\r\n\r\n\'And a white one on her fore-topmast.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s the admiral\'s flag, the flag of my Lord Nelson.  What is her\r\nfigure-head, my dear?\'\r\n\r\n\'A coat-of-arms, supported on this side by a sailor.\'\r\n\r\nHer companion nodded with satisfaction.  \'On the other side of that\r\nfigure-head is a marine.\'\r\n\r\n\'She is twisting round in a curious way, and her sails sink in like old\r\ncheeks, and she shivers like a leaf upon a tree.\'\r\n\r\n\'She is in stays, for the larboard tack.  I can see what she\'s been\r\ndoing.  She\'s been re\'ching close in to avoid the flood tide, as the wind\r\nis to the sou\'-west, and she\'s bound down; but as soon as the ebb made,\r\nd\'ye see, they made sail to the west\'ard.  Captain Hardy may be depended\r\nupon for that; he knows every current about here, being a native.\'\r\n\r\n\'And now I can see the other side; it is a soldier where a sailor was\r\nbefore.  You are _sure_ it is the Victory?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am sure.\'\r\n\r\nAfter this a frigate came into view--the Euryalus--sailing in the same\r\ndirection.  Anne sat down, and her eyes never left the ships.  \'Tell me\r\nmore about the Victory,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'She is the best sailer in the service, and she carries a hundred guns.\r\nThe heaviest be on the lower deck, the next size on the middle deck, the\r\nnext on the main and upper decks.  My son Ned\'s place is on the lower\r\ndeck, because he\'s short, and they put the short men below.\'\r\n\r\nBob, though not tall, was not likely to be specially selected for\r\nshortness.  She pictured him on the upper deck, in his snow-white\r\ntrousers and jacket of navy blue, looking perhaps towards the very point\r\nof land where she then was.\r\n\r\nThe great silent ship, with her population of blue-jackets, marines,\r\nofficers, captain, and the admiral who was not to return alive, passed\r\nlike a phantom the meridian of the Bill.  Sometimes her aspect was that\r\nof a large white bat, sometimes that of a grey one.  In the course of\r\ntime the watching girl saw that the ship had passed her nearest point;\r\nthe breadth of her sails diminished by foreshortening, till she assumed\r\nthe form of an egg on end.  After this something seemed to twinkle, and\r\nAnne, who had previously withdrawn from the old sailor, went back to him,\r\nand looked again through the glass.  The twinkling was the light falling\r\nupon the cabin windows of the ship\'s stern.  She explained it to the old\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\'Then we see now what the enemy have seen but once.  That was in seventy-\r\nnine, when she sighted the French and Spanish fleet off Scilly, and she\r\nretreated because she feared a landing.  Well, \'tis a brave ship and she\r\ncarries brave men!\'\r\n\r\nAnne\'s tender bosom heaved, but she said nothing, and again became\r\nabsorbed in contemplation.\r\n\r\nThe Victory was fast dropping away.  She was on the horizon, and soon\r\nappeared hull down.  That seemed to be like the beginning of a greater\r\nend than her present vanishing.  Anne Garland could not stay by the\r\nsailor any longer, and went about a stone\'s-throw off, where she was\r\nhidden by the inequality of the cliff from his view.  The vessel was now\r\nexactly end on, and stood out in the direction of the Start, her width\r\nhaving contracted to the proportion of a feather.  She sat down again,\r\nand mechanically took out some biscuits that she had brought, foreseeing\r\nthat her waiting might be long.  But she could not eat one of them;\r\neating seemed to jar with the mental tenseness of the moment; and her\r\nundeviating gaze continued to follow the lessened ship with the fidelity\r\nof a balanced needle to a magnetic stone, all else in her being\r\nmotionless.\r\n\r\nThe courses of the Victory were absorbed into the main, then her topsails\r\nwent, and then her top-gallants.  She was now no more than a dead fly\'s\r\nwing on a sheet of spider\'s web; and even this fragment diminished.  Anne\r\ncould hardly bear to see the end, and yet she resolved not to flinch.  The\r\nadmiral\'s flag sank behind the watery line, and in a minute the very\r\ntruck of the last topmast stole away.  The Victory was gone.\r\n\r\nAnne\'s lip quivered as she murmured, without removing her wet eyes from\r\nthe vacant and solemn horizon, \'"They that go down to the sea in ships,\r\nthat do business in great waters--"\'\r\n\r\n\'"These see the works of the Lord, and His wonders in the deep,"\' was\r\nreturned by a man\'s voice from behind her.\r\n\r\nLooking round quickly, she saw a soldier standing there; and the grave\r\neyes of John Loveday bent on her.\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis what I was thinking,\' she said, trying to be composed.\r\n\r\n\'You were saying it,\' he answered gently.\r\n\r\n\'Was I?--I did not know it. . . .  How came you here?\' she presently\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n\'I have been behind you a good while; but you never turned round.\'\r\n\r\n\'I was deeply occupied,\' she said in an undertone.\r\n\r\n\'Yes--I too came to see him pass.  I heard this morning that Lord Nelson\r\nhad embarked, and I knew at once that they would sail immediately.  The\r\nVictory and Euryalus are to join the rest of the fleet at Plymouth.  There\r\nwas a great crowd of people assembled to see the admiral off; they\r\ncheered him and the ship as she dropped down.  He took his coffin on\r\nboard with him, they say.\'\r\n\r\n\'His coffin!\' said Anne, turning deadly pale.  \'Something terrible, then,\r\nis meant by that!  O, why _would_ Bob go in that ship? doomed to\r\ndestruction from the very beginning like this!\'\r\n\r\n\'It was his determination to sail under Captain Hardy, and under no one\r\nelse,\' said John.  \'There may be hot work; but we must hope for the\r\nbest.\'  And observing how wretched she looked, he added, \'But won\'t you\r\nlet me help you back?  If you can walk as far as Hope Cove it will be\r\nenough.  A lerret is going from there across the bay homeward to the\r\nharbour in the course of an hour; it belongs to a man I know, and they\r\ncan take one passenger, I am sure.\'\r\n\r\nShe turned her back upon the Channel, and by his help soon reached the\r\nplace indicated.  The boat was lying there as he had said.  She found it\r\nto belong to the old man who had been with her at the Bill, and was in\r\ncharge of his two younger sons.  The trumpet-major helped her into it\r\nover the slippery blocks of stone, one of the young men spread his jacket\r\nfor her to sit on, and as soon as they pulled from shore John climbed up\r\nthe blue-grey cliff, and disappeared over the top, to return to the\r\nmainland by road.\r\n\r\nAnne was in the town by three o\'clock.  The trip in the stern of the\r\nlerret had quite refreshed her, with the help of the biscuits, which she\r\nhad at last been able to eat.  The van from the port to Overcombe did not\r\nstart till four o\'clock, and feeling no further interest in the gaieties\r\nof the place, she strolled on past the King\'s house to the outskirts, her\r\nmind settling down again upon the possibly sad fate of the Victory when\r\nshe found herself alone.  She did not hurry on; and finding that even now\r\nthere wanted another half-hour to the carrier\'s time, she turned into a\r\nlittle lane to escape the inspection of the numerous passers-by.  Here\r\nall was quite lonely and still, and she sat down under a willow-tree,\r\nabsently regarding the landscape, which had begun to put on the rich\r\ntones of declining summer, but which to her was as hollow and faded as a\r\ntheatre by day.  She could hold out no longer; burying her face in her\r\nhands, she wept without restraint.\r\n\r\nSome yards behind her was a little spring of water, having a stone margin\r\nround it to prevent the cattle from treading in the sides and filling it\r\nup with dirt.  While she wept, two elderly gentlemen entered unperceived\r\nupon the scene, and walked on to the spring\'s brink.  Here they paused\r\nand looked in, afterwards moving round it, and then stooping as if to\r\nsmell or taste its waters.  The spring was, in fact, a sulphurous one,\r\nthen recently discovered by a physician who lived in the neighbourhood;\r\nand it was beginning to attract some attention, having by common report\r\ncontributed to effect such wonderful cures as almost passed belief.  After\r\na considerable discussion, apparently on how the pool might be improved\r\nfor better use, one of the two elderly gentlemen turned away, leaving the\r\nother still probing the spring with his cane.  The first stranger, who\r\nwore a blue coat with gilt buttons, came on in the direction of Anne\r\nGarland, and seeing her sad posture went quickly up to her, and said\r\nabruptly, \'What is the matter?\'\r\n\r\nAnne, who in her grief had observed nothing of the gentlemen\'s presence,\r\nwithdrew her handkerchief from her eyes and started to her feet.  She\r\ninstantly recognised her interrogator as the King.\r\n\r\n\'What, what, crying?\' his Majesty inquired kindly.  \'How is this!\'\r\n\r\n\'I--have seen a dear friend go away, sir,\' she faltered, with downcast\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\'Ah--partings are sad--very sad--for us all.  You must hope your friend\r\nwill return soon.  Where is he or she gone?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know, your Majesty.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t know--how is that?\'\r\n\r\n\'He is a sailor on board the Victory.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then he has reason to be proud,\' said the King with interest.  \'He is\r\nyour brother?\'\r\n\r\nAnne tried to explain what he was, but could not, and blushed with\r\npainful heat.\r\n\r\n\'Well, well, well; what is his name?\'\r\n\r\nIn spite of Anne\'s confusion and low spirits, her womanly shrewdness told\r\nher at once that no harm could be done by revealing Bob\'s name; and she\r\nanswered, \'His name is Robert Loveday, sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'Loveday--a good name.  I shall not forget it.  Now dry your cheeks, and\r\ndon\'t cry any more.  Loveday--Robert Loveday.\'\r\n\r\nAnne curtseyed, the King smiled good-humouredly, and turned to rejoin his\r\ncompanion, who was afterwards heard to be Dr. ---, the physician in\r\nattendance at Gloucester Lodge.  This gentleman had in the meantime\r\nfilled a small phial with the medicinal water, which he carefully placed\r\nin his pocket; and on the King coming up they retired together and\r\ndisappeared.  Thereupon Anne, now thoroughly aroused, followed the same\r\nway with a gingerly tread, just in time to see them get into a carriage\r\nwhich was in waiting at the turning of the lane.\r\n\r\nShe quite forgot the carrier, and everything else in connexion with\r\nriding home.  Flying along the road rapidly and unconsciously, when she\r\nawoke to a sense of her whereabouts she was so near to Overcombe as to\r\nmake the carrier not worth waiting for.  She had been borne up in this\r\nhasty spurt at the end of a weary day by visions of Bob promoted to the\r\nrank of admiral, or something equally wonderful, by the King\'s special\r\ncommand, the chief result of the promotion being, in her arrangement of\r\nthe piece, that he would stay at home and go to sea no more.  But she was\r\nnot a girl who indulged in extravagant fancies long, and before she\r\nreached home she thought that the King had probably forgotten her by that\r\ntime, and her troubles, and her lover\'s name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV.  A SAILOR ENTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remaining fortnight of the month of September passed away, with a\r\ngeneral decline from the summer\'s excitements.  The royal family left the\r\nwatering-place the first week in October, the German Legion with their\r\nartillery about the same time.  The dragoons still remained at the\r\nbarracks just out of the town, and John Loveday brought to Anne every\r\nnewspaper that he could lay hands on, especially such as contained any\r\nfragment of shipping news.  This threw them much together; and at these\r\ntimes John was often awkward and confused, on account of the unwonted\r\nstress of concealing his great love for her.\r\n\r\nHer interests had grandly developed from the limits of Overcombe and the\r\ntown life hard by, to an extensiveness truly European.  During the whole\r\nmonth of October, however, not a single grain of information reached her,\r\nor anybody else, concerning Nelson and his blockading squadron off Cadiz.\r\nThere were the customary bad jokes about Buonaparte, especially when it\r\nwas found that the whole French army had turned its back upon Boulogne\r\nand set out for the Rhine.  Then came accounts of his march through\r\nGermany and into Austria; but not a word about the Victory.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of autumn John brought news which fearfully depressed\r\nher.  The Austrian General Mack had capitulated with his whole army.  Then\r\nwere revived the old misgivings as to invasion.  \'Instead of having to\r\ncope with him weary with waiting, we shall have to encounter This Man\r\nfresh from the fields of victory,\' ran the newspaper article.\r\n\r\nBut the week which had led off with such a dreary piping was to end in\r\nanother key.  On the very day when Mack\'s army was piling arms at the\r\nfeet of its conqueror, a blow had been struck by Bob Loveday and his\r\ncomrades which eternally shattered the enemy\'s force by sea.  Four days\r\nafter the receipt of the Austrian news Corporal Tullidge ran into the\r\nmiller\'s house to inform him that on the previous Monday, at eleven in\r\nthe morning, the Pickle schooner, Lieutenant Lapenotiere, had arrived at\r\nFalmouth with despatches from the fleet; that the stage-coaches on the\r\nhighway through Wessex to London were chalked with the words \'Great\r\nVictory!\' \'Glorious Triumph!\' and so on; and that all the country people\r\nwere wild to know particulars.\r\n\r\nOn Friday afternoon John arrived with authentic news of the battle off\r\nCape Trafalgar, and the death of Nelson.  Captain Hardy was alive, though\r\nhis escape had been narrow enough, his shoe-buckle having been carried\r\naway by a shot.  It was feared that the Victory had been the scene of the\r\nheaviest slaughter among all the ships engaged, but as yet no returns of\r\nkilled and wounded had been issued, beyond a rough list of the numbers in\r\nsome of the ships.\r\n\r\nThe suspense of the little household in Overcombe Mill was great in the\r\nextreme.  John came thither daily for more than a week; but no further\r\nparticulars reached England till the end of that time, and then only the\r\nmeagre intelligence that there had been a gale immediately after the\r\nbattle, and that many of the prizes had been lost.  Anne said little to\r\nall these things, and preserved a superstratum of calmness on her\r\ncountenance; but some inner voice seemed to whisper to her that Bob was\r\nno more.  Miller Loveday drove to Pos\'ham several times to learn if the\r\nCaptain\'s sisters had received any more definite tidings than these\r\nflying reports; but that family had heard nothing which could in any way\r\nrelieve the miller\'s anxiety.  When at last, at the end of November,\r\nthere appeared a final and revised list of killed and wounded as issued\r\nby Admiral Collingwood, it was a useless sheet to the Lovedays.  To their\r\ngreat pain it contained no names but those of officers, the friends of\r\nordinary seamen and marines being in those good old days left to discover\r\ntheir losses as best they might.\r\n\r\nAnne\'s conviction of her loss increased with the darkening of the early\r\nwinter time.  Bob was not a cautious man who would avoid needless\r\nexposure, and a hundred and fifty of the Victory\'s crew had been disabled\r\nor slain.  Anybody who had looked into her room at this time would have\r\nseen that her favourite reading was the office for the Burial of the Dead\r\nat Sea, beginning \'We therefore commit his body to the deep.\'  In these\r\nfirst days of December several of the victorious fleet came into port;\r\nbut not the Victory.  Many supposed that that noble ship, disabled by the\r\nbattle, had gone to the bottom in the subsequent tempestuous weather; and\r\nthe belief was persevered in till it was told in the town and port that\r\nshe had been seen passing up the Channel.  Two days later the Victory\r\narrived at Portsmouth.\r\n\r\nThen letters from survivors began to appear in the public prints which\r\nJohn so regularly brought to Anne; but though he watched the mails with\r\nunceasing vigilance there was never a letter from Bob.  It sometimes\r\ncrossed John\'s mind that his brother might still be alive and well, and\r\nthat in his wish to abide by his expressed intention of giving up Anne\r\nand home life he was deliberately lax in writing.  If so, Bob was\r\ncarrying out the idea too thoughtlessly by half, as could be seen by\r\nwatching the effects of suspense upon the fair face of the victim, and\r\nthe anxiety of the rest of the family.\r\n\r\nIt was a clear day in December.  The first slight snow of the season had\r\nbeen sifted over the earth, and one side of the apple-tree branches in\r\nthe miller\'s garden was touched with white, though a few leaves were\r\nstill lingering on the tops of the younger trees.  A short sailor of the\r\nRoyal Navy, who was not Bob, nor anything like him, crossed the mill\r\ncourt and came to the door.  The miller hastened out and brought him into\r\nthe room, where John, Mrs. Loveday, and Anne Garland were all present.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m from aboard the Victory,\' said the sailor.  \'My name\'s Jim Cornick.\r\nAnd your lad is alive and well.\'\r\n\r\nThey breathed rather than spoke their thankfulness and relief, the\r\nmiller\'s eyes being moist as he turned aside to calm himself; while Anne,\r\nhaving first jumped up wildly from her seat, sank back again under the\r\nalmost insupportable joy that trembled through her limbs to her utmost\r\nfinger.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve come from Spithead to Pos\'ham,\' the sailor continued, \'and now I am\r\ngoing on to father at Budmouth.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah!--I know your father,\' cried the trumpet-major, \'old James Cornick.\'\r\n\r\nIt was the man who had brought Anne in his lerret from Portland Bill.\r\n\r\n\'And Bob hasn\'t got a scratch?\' said the miller.\r\n\r\n\'Not a scratch,\' said Cornick.\r\n\r\nLoveday then bustled off to draw the visitor something to drink.  Anne\r\nGarland, with a glowing blush on her face, had gone to the back part of\r\nthe room, where she was the very embodiment of sweet content as she\r\nslightly swayed herself without speaking.  A little tide of happiness\r\nseemed to ebb and flow through her in listening to the sailor\'s words,\r\nmoving her figure with it.  The seaman and John went on conversing.\r\n\r\n\'Bob had a good deal to do with barricading the hawse-holes afore we were\r\nin action, and the Adm\'l and Cap\'n both were very much pleased at how\r\n\'twas done.  When the Adm\'l went up the quarter-deck ladder, Cap\'n Hardy\r\nsaid a word or two to Bob, but what it was I don\'t know, for I was\r\nquartered at a gun some ways off.  However, Bob saw the Adm\'l stagger\r\nwhen \'a was wownded, and was one of the men who carried him to the\r\ncockpit.  After that he and some other lads jumped aboard the French\r\nship, and I believe they was in her when she struck her flag.  What \'a\r\ndid next I can\'t say, for the wind had dropped, and the smoke was like a\r\ncloud.  But \'a got a good deal talked about; and they say there\'s\r\npromotion in store for\'n.\'\r\n\r\nAt this point in the story Jim Cornick stopped to drink, and a low\r\nunconscious humming came from Anne in her distant corner; the faint\r\nmelody continued more or less when the conversation between the sailor\r\nand the Lovedays was renewed.\r\n\r\n\'We heard afore that the Victory was near knocked to pieces,\' said the\r\nmiller.\r\n\r\n\'Knocked to pieces?  You\'d say so if so be you could see her!  Gad, her\r\nsides be battered like an old penny piece; the shot be still sticking in\r\nher wales, and her sails be like so many clap-nets: we have run all the\r\nway home under jury topmasts; and as for her decks, you may swab wi\' hot\r\nwater, and you may swab wi\' cold, but there\'s the blood-stains, and there\r\nthey\'ll bide. . . .  The Cap\'n had a narrow escape, like many o\' the\r\nrest--a shot shaved his ankle like a razor.  You should have seen that\r\nman\'s face in the het o\' battle, his features were as if they\'d been cast\r\nin steel.\'\r\n\r\n\'We rather expected a letter from Bob before this.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said Jim Cornick, with a smile of toleration, \'you must make\r\nallowances.  The truth o\'t is, he\'s engaged just now at Portsmouth, like\r\na good many of the rest from our ship. . . .  \'Tis a very nice young\r\nwoman that he\'s a courting of, and I make no doubt that she\'ll be an\r\nexcellent wife for him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah!\' said Mrs. Loveday, in a warning tone.\r\n\r\n\'Courting--wife?\' said the miller.\r\n\r\nThey instinctively looked towards Anne.  Anne had started as if shaken by\r\nan invisible hand, and a thick mist of doubt seemed to obscure the\r\nintelligence of her eyes.  This was but for two or three moments.  Very\r\npale, she arose and went right up to the seaman.  John gently tried to\r\nintercept her, but she passed him by.\r\n\r\n\'Do you speak of Robert Loveday as courting a wife?\' she asked, without\r\nthe least betrayal of emotion.\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t see you, miss,\' replied Cornick, turning.  \'Yes, your brother\r\nhev\' his eye on a wife, and he deserves one.  I hope you don\'t mind?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not in the least,\' she said, with a stage laugh.  \'I am interested,\r\nnaturally.  And what is she?\'\r\n\r\n\'A very nice young master-baker\'s daughter, honey.  A very wise choice of\r\nthe young man\'s.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is she fair or dark?\'\r\n\r\n\'Her hair is rather light.\'\r\n\r\n\'I like light hair; and her name?\'\r\n\r\n\'Her name is Caroline.  But can it be that my story hurts ye?  If so--\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes,\' said John, interposing anxiously.  \'We don\'t care for more\r\njust at this moment.\'\r\n\r\n\'We _do_ care for more!\' said Anne vehemently.  \'Tell it all, sailor.\r\nThat is a very pretty name, Caroline.  When are they going to be\r\nmarried?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know as how the day is settled,\' answered Jim, even now scarcely\r\nconscious of the devastation he was causing in one fair breast.  \'But\r\nfrom the rate the courting is scudding along at, I should say it won\'t be\r\nlong first.\'\r\n\r\n\'If you see him when you go back, give him my best wishes,\' she lightly\r\nsaid, as she moved away.  \'And,\' she added, with solemn bitterness, \'say\r\nthat I am glad to hear he is making such good use of the first days of\r\nhis escape from the Valley of the Shadow of Death!\'  She went away,\r\nexpressing indifference by audibly singing in the distance--\r\n\r\n   \'Shall we go dance the round, the round, the round,\r\n      Shall we go dance the round?\'\r\n\r\n\'Your sister is lively at the news,\' observed Jim Cornick.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' murmured John gloomily, as he gnawed his lower lip and kept his\r\neyes fixed on the fire.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' continued the man from the Victory, \'I won\'t say that your\r\nbrother\'s intended ha\'n\'t got some ballast, which is very lucky for\'n, as\r\nhe might have picked up with a girl without a single copper nail.  To be\r\nsure there was a time we had when we got into port!  It was open house\r\nfor us all!\'  And after mentally regarding the scene for a few seconds\r\nJim emptied his cup and rose to go.\r\n\r\nThe miller was saying some last words to him outside the house, Anne\'s\r\nvoice had hardly ceased singing upstairs, John was standing by the\r\nfireplace, and Mrs. Loveday was crossing the room to join her daughter,\r\nwhose manner had given her some uneasiness, when a noise came from above\r\nthe ceiling, as of some heavy body falling.  Mrs. Loveday rushed to the\r\nstaircase, saying, \'Ah, I feared something!\' and she was followed by\r\nJohn.\r\n\r\nWhen they entered Anne\'s room, which they both did almost at one moment,\r\nthey found her lying insensible upon the floor.  The trumpet-major, his\r\nlips tightly closed, lifted her in his arms, and laid her upon the bed;\r\nafter which he went back to the door to give room to her mother, who was\r\nbending over the girl with some hartshorn.\r\n\r\nPresently Mrs. Loveday looked up and said to him, \'She is only in a\r\nfaint, John, and her colour is coming back.  Now leave her to me; I will\r\nbe downstairs in a few minutes, and tell you how she is.\'\r\n\r\nJohn left the room.  When he gained the lower apartment his father was\r\nstanding by the chimney-piece, the sailor having gone.  The trumpet-major\r\nwent up to the fire, and, grasping the edge of the high chimney-shelf,\r\nstood silent.\r\n\r\n\'Did I hear a noise when I went out?\' asked the elder, in a tone of\r\nmisgiving.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, you did,\' said John.  \'It was she, but her mother says she is\r\nbetter now.  Father,\' he added impetuously, \'Bob is a worthless\r\nblockhead!  If there had been any good in him he would have been drowned\r\nyears ago!\'\r\n\r\n\'John, John--not too fast,\' said the miller.  \'That\'s a hard thing to say\r\nof your brother, and you ought to be ashamed of it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, he tries me more than I can bear.  Good God! what can a man be\r\nmade of to go on as he does?  Why didn\'t he come home; or if he couldn\'t\r\nget leave why didn\'t he write?  \'Tis scandalous of him to serve a woman\r\nlike that!\'\r\n\r\n\'Gently, gently.  The chap hev done his duty as a sailor; and though\r\nthere might have been something between him and Anne, her mother, in\r\ntalking it over with me, has said many times that she couldn\'t think of\r\ntheir marrying till Bob had settled down in business with me.  Folks that\r\ngain victories must have a little liberty allowed \'em.  Look at the\r\nAdmiral himself, for that matter.\'\r\n\r\nJohn continued looking at the red coals, till hearing Mrs. Loveday\'s foot\r\non the staircase, he went to meet her.\r\n\r\n\'She is better,\' said Mrs. Loveday; \'but she won\'t come down again to-\r\nday.\'\r\n\r\nCould John have heard what the poor girl was moaning to herself at that\r\nmoment as she lay writhing on the bed, he would have doubted her mother\'s\r\nassurance.  \'If he had been dead I could have borne it, but this I cannot\r\nbear!\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI.  DERRIMAN SEES CHANCES\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Sailor Cornick had gone on his way as far as the forking roads,\r\nwhere he met Festus Derriman on foot.  The latter, attracted by the\r\nseaman\'s dress, and by seeing him come from the mill, at once accosted\r\nhim.  Jim, with the greatest readiness, fell into conversation, and told\r\nthe same story as that he had related at the mill.\r\n\r\n\'Bob Loveday going to be married?\' repeated Festus.\r\n\r\n\'You all seem struck of a heap wi\' that.\'\r\n\r\n\'No; I never heard news that pleased me more.\'\r\n\r\nWhen Cornick was gone, Festus, instead of passing straight on, halted on\r\nthe little bridge and meditated.  Bob, being now interested elsewhere,\r\nwould probably not resent the siege of Anne\'s heart by another; there\r\ncould, at any rate, be no further possibility of that looming duel which\r\nhad troubled the yeoman\'s mind ever since his horse-play on Anne at the\r\nhouse on the down.  To march into the mill and propose to Mrs. Loveday\r\nfor Anne before John\'s interest could revive in her was, to this hero\'s\r\nthinking, excellent discretion.\r\n\r\nThe day had already begun to darken when he entered, and the cheerful\r\nfire shone red upon the floor and walls.  Mrs. Loveday received him\r\nalone, and asked him to take a seat by the chimney-corner, a little of\r\nthe old hankering for him as a son-in-law having permanently remained\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\n\'Your servant, Mrs. Loveday,\' he said, \'and I will tell you at once what\r\nI come for.  You will say that I take time by the forelock when I inform\r\nyou that it is to push on my long-wished-for alliance wi\' your daughter,\r\nas I believe she is now a free woman again.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, Mr. Derriman,\' said the mother placably.  \'But she is ill at\r\npresent.  I\'ll mention it to her when she is better.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ask her to alter her cruel, cruel resolves against me, on the score\r\nof--of my consuming passion for her.  In short,\' continued Festus,\r\ndropping his parlour language in his warmth, \'I\'ll tell thee what, Dame\r\nLoveday, I want the maid, and must have her.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Loveday replied that that was very plain speaking.\r\n\r\n\'Well, \'tis.  But Bob has given her up.  He never meant to marry her.\r\nI\'ll tell you, Mrs. Loveday, what I have never told a soul before.  I was\r\nstanding upon Budmouth Quay on that very day in last September that Bob\r\nset sail, and I heard him say to his brother John that he gave your\r\ndaughter up.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then it was very unmannerly of him to trifle with her so,\' said Mrs.\r\nLoveday warmly.  \'Who did he give her up to?\'\r\n\r\nFestus replied with hesitation, \'He gave her up to John.\'\r\n\r\n\'To John?  How could he give her up to a man already over head and ears\r\nin love with that actress woman?\'\r\n\r\n\'O?  You surprise me.  Which actress is it?\'\r\n\r\n\'That Miss Johnson.  Anne tells me that he loves her hopelessly.\'\r\n\r\nFestus arose.  Miss Johnson seemed suddenly to acquire high value as a\r\nsweetheart at this announcement.  He had himself felt a nameless\r\nattractiveness in her, and John had done likewise.  John crossed his path\r\nin all possible ways.\r\n\r\nBefore the yeoman had replied somebody opened the door, and the firelight\r\nshone upon the uniform of the person they discussed.  Festus nodded on\r\nrecognizing him, wished Mrs. Loveday good evening, and went out\r\nprecipitately.\r\n\r\n\'So Bob told you he meant to break off with my Anne when he went away?\'\r\nMrs. Loveday remarked to the trumpet-major.  \'I wish I had known of it\r\nbefore.\'\r\n\r\nJohn appeared disturbed at the sudden charge.  He murmured that he could\r\nnot deny it, and then hastily turned from her and followed Derriman, whom\r\nhe saw before him on the bridge.\r\n\r\n\'Derriman!\' he shouted.\r\n\r\nFestus started and looked round.  \'Well, trumpet-major,\' he said blandly.\r\n\r\n\'When will you have sense enough to mind your own business, and not come\r\nhere telling things you have heard by sneaking behind people\'s backs?\'\r\ndemanded John hotly.  \'If you can\'t learn in any other way, I shall have\r\nto pull your ears again, as I did the other day!\'\r\n\r\n\'_You_ pull my ears?  How can you tell that lie, when you know \'twas\r\nsomebody else pulled \'em?\'\r\n\r\n\'O no, no.  I pulled your ears, and thrashed you in a mild way.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll swear to it?  Surely \'twas another man?\'\r\n\r\n\'It was in the parlour at the public-house; you were almost in the dark.\'\r\nAnd John added a few details as to the particular blows, which amounted\r\nto proof itself.\r\n\r\n\'Then I heartily ask your pardon for saying \'twas a lie!\' cried Festus,\r\nadvancing with extended hand and a genial smile.  \'Sure, if I had known\r\n_\'twas_ you, I wouldn\'t have insulted you by denying it.\'\r\n\r\n\'That was why you didn\'t challenge me, then?\'\r\n\r\n\'That was it!  I wouldn\'t for the world have hurt your nice sense of\r\nhonour by letting \'ee go unchallenged, if I had known!  And now, you see,\r\nunfortunately I can\'t mend the mistake.  So long a time has passed since\r\nit happened that the heat of my temper is gone off.  I couldn\'t oblige\r\n\'ee, try how I might, for I am not a man, trumpet-major, that can butcher\r\nin cold blood--no, not I, nor you neither, from what I know of \'ee.  So,\r\nwilly-nilly, we must fain let it pass, eh?\'\r\n\r\n\'We must, I suppose,\' said John, smiling grimly.  \'Who did you think I\r\nwas, then, that night when I boxed you all round?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, don\'t press me,\' replied the yeoman.  \'I can\'t reveal; it would be\r\ndisgracing myself to show how very wide of the truth the mockery of wine\r\nwas able to lead my senses.  We will let it be buried in eternal mixens\r\nof forgetfulness.\'\r\n\r\n\'As you wish,\' said the trumpet-major loftily.  \'But if you ever _should_\r\nthink you knew it was me, why, you know where to find me?\'  And Loveday\r\nwalked away.\r\n\r\nThe instant that he was gone Festus shook his fist at the evening star,\r\nwhich happened to lie in the same direction as that taken by the dragoon.\r\n\r\n\'Now for my revenge!  Duels?  Lifelong disgrace to me if ever I fight\r\nwith a man of blood below my own!  There are other remedies for upper-\r\nclass souls!. . .  Matilda--that\'s my way.\'\r\n\r\nFestus strode along till he reached the Hall, where Cripplestraw appeared\r\ngazing at him from under the arch of the porter\'s lodge.  Derriman dashed\r\nopen the entrance-hurdle with such violence that the whole row of them\r\nfell flat in the mud.\r\n\r\n\'Mercy, Maister Festus!\' said Cripplestraw.  \'"Surely," I says to myself\r\nwhen I see ye a-coming, "surely Maister Festus is fuming like that\r\nbecause there\'s no chance of the enemy coming this year after all."\'\r\n\r\n\'Cr-r-ripplestraw!  I have been wounded to the heart,\' replied Derriman,\r\nwith a lurid brow.\r\n\r\n\'And the man yet lives, and you wants yer horse-pistols instantly?\r\nCertainly, Maister F---\'\r\n\r\n\'No, Cripplestraw, not my pistols, but my new-cut clothes, my heavy gold\r\nseals, my silver-topped cane, and my buckles that cost more money than he\r\never saw!  Yes, I must tell somebody, and I\'ll tell you, because there\'s\r\nno other fool near.  He loves her heart and soul.  He\'s poor; she\'s tip-\r\ntop genteel, and not rich.  I am rich, by comparison.  I\'ll court the\r\npretty play-actress, and win her before his eyes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Play-actress, Maister Derriman?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  I saw her this very day, met her by accident, and spoke to her.\r\nShe\'s still in the town--perhaps because of him.  I can meet her at any\r\nhour of the day--  But I don\'t mean to marry her; not I.  I will court\r\nher for my pastime, and to annoy him.  It will be all the more death to\r\nhim that I don\'t want her.  Then perhaps he will say to me, "You have\r\ntaken my one ewe lamb"--meaning that I am the king, and he\'s the poor\r\nman, as in the church verse; and he\'ll beg for mercy when \'tis too\r\nlate--unless, meanwhile, I shall have tired of my new toy.  Saddle the\r\nhorse, Cripplestraw, to-morrow at ten.\'\r\n\r\nFull of this resolve to scourge John Loveday to the quick through his\r\npassion for Miss Johnson, Festus came out booted and spurred at the time\r\nappointed, and set off on his morning ride.\r\n\r\nMiss Johnson\'s theatrical engagement having long ago terminated, she\r\nwould have left the Royal watering-place with the rest of the visitors\r\nhad not matrimonial hopes detained her there.  These had nothing whatever\r\nto do with John Loveday, as may be imagined, but with a stout, staid boat-\r\nbuilder in Cove Row by the quay, who had shown much interest in her\r\nimpersonations.  Unfortunately this substantial man had not been quite so\r\nattentive since the end of the season as his previous manner led her to\r\nexpect; and it was a great pleasure to the lady to see Mr. Derriman\r\nleaning over the harbour bridge with his eyes fixed upon her as she came\r\ntowards it after a stroll past her elderly wooer\'s house.\r\n\r\n\'Od take it, ma\'am, you didn\'t tell me when I saw you last that the\r\ntooting man with the blue jacket and lace was yours devoted?\' began\r\nFestus.\r\n\r\n\'Who do you mean?\'  In Matilda\'s ever-changing emotional interests, John\r\nLoveday was a stale and unprofitable personality.\r\n\r\n\'Why, that trumpet-major man.\'\r\n\r\n\'O!  What of him?\'\r\n\r\n\'Come; he loves you, and you know it, ma\'am.\'\r\n\r\nShe knew, at any rate, how to take the current when it served.  So she\r\nglanced at Festus, folded her lips meaningly, and nodded.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve come to cut him out.\'\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, it being unsafe to speak till she knew a little more\r\nof the subject.\r\n\r\n\'What!\' said Festus, reddening, \'do you mean to say that you think of him\r\nseriously--you, who might look so much higher?\'\r\n\r\n\'Constant dropping will wear away a stone; and you should only hear his\r\npleading!  His handsome face is impressive, and his manners are--O, so\r\ngenteel!  I am not rich; I am, in short, a poor lady of decayed family,\r\nwho has nothing to boast of but my blood and ancestors, and they won\'t\r\nfind a body in food and clothing!--I hold the world but as the world,\r\nDerrimanio--a stage where every man must play a part, and mine a sad\r\none!\'  She dropped her eyes thoughtfully and sighed.\r\n\r\n\'We will talk of this,\' said Festus, much affected.  \'Let us walk to the\r\nLook-out.\'\r\n\r\nShe made no objection, and said, as they turned that way, \'Mr. Derriman,\r\na long time ago I found something belonging to you; but I have never yet\r\nremembered to return it.\'  And she drew from her bosom the paper which\r\nAnne had dropped in the meadow when eluding the grasp of Festus on that\r\nsummer day.\r\n\r\n\'Zounds, I smell fresh meat!\' cried Festus when he had looked it over.\r\n\'\'Tis in my uncle\'s writing, and \'tis what I heard him singing on the day\r\nthe French didn\'t come, and afterwards saw him marking in the road.  \'Tis\r\nsomething he\'s got hid away.  Give me the paper, there\'s a dear; \'tis\r\nworth sterling gold!\'\r\n\r\n\'Halves, then?\' said Matilda tenderly.\r\n\r\n\'Gad, yes--anything!\' replied Festus, blazing into a smile, for she had\r\nlooked up in her best new manner at the possibility that he might be\r\nworth the winning.  They went up the steps to the summit of the cliff,\r\nand dwindled over it against the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII.  REACTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no letter from Bob, though December had passed, and the new\r\nyear was two weeks old.  His movements were, however, pretty accurately\r\nregistered in the papers, which John still brought, but which Anne no\r\nlonger read.  During the second week in December the Victory sailed for\r\nSheerness, and on the 9th of the following January the public funeral of\r\nLord Nelson took place in St. Paul\'s.\r\n\r\nThen there came a meagre line addressed to the family in general.  Bob\'s\r\nnew Portsmouth attachment was not mentioned, but he told them he had been\r\none of the eight-and-forty seamen who walked two-and-two in the funeral\r\nprocession, and that Captain Hardy had borne the banner of emblems on the\r\nsame occasion.  The crew was soon to be paid off at Chatham, when he\r\nthought of returning to Portsmouth for a few days to see a valued friend.\r\nAfter that he should come home.\r\n\r\nBut the spring advanced without bringing him, and John watched Anne\r\nGarland\'s desolation with augmenting desire to do something towards\r\nconsoling her.  The old feelings, so religiously held in check, were\r\nstimulated to rebelliousness, though they did not show themselves in any\r\ndirect manner as yet.\r\n\r\nThe miller, in the meantime, who seldom interfered in such matters, was\r\nobserved to look meaningly at Anne and the trumpet-major from day to day;\r\nand by-and-by he spoke privately to John.\r\n\r\nHis words were short and to the point: Anne was very melancholy; she had\r\nthought too much of Bob.  Now \'twas plain that they had lost him for many\r\nyears to come.  Well; he had always felt that of the two he would rather\r\nJohn married her.  Now John might settle down there, and succeed where\r\nBob had failed.  \'So if you could get her, my sonny, to think less of him\r\nand more of thyself, it would be a good thing for all.\'\r\n\r\nAn inward excitement had risen in John; but he suppressed it and said\r\nfirmly--\r\n\r\n\'Fairness to Bob before everything!\'\r\n\r\n\'He hev forgot her, and there\'s an end on\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'She\'s not forgot him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, well; think it over.\'\r\n\r\nThis discourse was the cause of his penning a letter to his brother.  He\r\nbegged for a distinct statement whether, as John at first supposed, Bob\'s\r\nverbal renunciation of Anne on the quay had been only a momentary\r\nebullition of friendship, which it would be cruel to take literally; or\r\nwhether, as seemed now, it had passed from a hasty resolve to a standing\r\npurpose, persevered in for his own pleasure, with not a care for the\r\nresult on poor Anne.\r\n\r\nJohn waited anxiously for the answer, but no answer came; and the silence\r\nseemed even more significant than a letter of assurance could have been\r\nof his absolution from further support to a claim which Bob himself had\r\nso clearly renounced.  Thus it happened that paternal pressure, brotherly\r\nindifference, and his own released impulse operated in one delightful\r\ndirection, and the trumpet-major once more approached Anne as in the old\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nBut it was not till she had been left to herself for a full five months,\r\nand the blue-bells and ragged-robins of the following year were again\r\nmaking themselves common to the rambling eye, that he directly addressed\r\nher.  She was tying up a group of tall flowering plants in the garden:\r\nshe knew that he was behind her, but she did not turn.  She had subsided\r\ninto a placid dignity which enabled her when watched to perform any\r\nlittle action with seeming composure--very different from the flutter of\r\nher inexperienced days.\r\n\r\n\'Are you never going to turn round?\' he at length asked good-humouredly.\r\n\r\nShe then did turn, and looked at him for a moment without speaking; a\r\ncertain suspicion looming in her eyes, as if suggested by his perceptible\r\nwant of ease.\r\n\r\n\'How like summer it is getting to feel, is it not?\' she said.\r\n\r\nJohn admitted that it was getting to feel like summer: and, bending his\r\ngaze upon her with an earnestness which no longer left any doubt of his\r\nsubject, went on to ask--\r\n\r\n\'Have you ever in these last weeks thought of how it used to be between\r\nus?\'\r\n\r\nShe replied quickly, \'O, John, you shouldn\'t begin that again.  I am\r\nalmost another woman now!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, that\'s all the more reason why I should, isn\'t it?\'\r\n\r\nAnne looked thoughtfully to the other end of the garden, faintly shaking\r\nher head; \'I don\'t quite see it like that,\' she returned.\r\n\r\n\'You feel yourself quite free, don\'t you?\'\r\n\r\n\'_Quite_ free!\' she said instantly, and with proud distinctness; her eyes\r\nfell, and she repeated more slowly, \'Quite free.\'  Then her thoughts\r\nseemed to fly from herself to him.  \'But you are not?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am not?\'\r\n\r\n\'Miss Johnson!\'\r\n\r\n\'O--that woman!  You know as well as I that was all make-up, and that I\r\nnever for a moment thought of her.\'\r\n\r\n\'I had an idea you were acting; but I wasn\'t sure.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, that\'s nothing now.  Anne, I want to relieve your life; to cheer\r\nyou in some way; to make some amends for my brother\'s bad conduct.  If\r\nyou cannot love me, liking will be well enough.  I have thought over\r\nevery side of it so many times--for months have I been thinking it\r\nover--and I am at last sure that I do right to put it to you in this way.\r\nThat I don\'t wrong Bob I am quite convinced.  As far as he is concerned\r\nwe be both free.  Had I not been sure of that I would never have spoken.\r\nFather wants me to take on the mill, and it will please him if you can\r\ngive me one little hope; it will make the house go on altogether better\r\nif you can think o\' me.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are generous and good, John,\' she said, as a big round tear bowled\r\nhelter-skelter down her face and hat-strings.\r\n\r\n\'I am not that; I fear I am quite the opposite,\' he said, without looking\r\nat her.  \'It would be all gain to me--  But you have not answered my\r\nquestion.\'\r\n\r\nShe lifted her eyes.  \'John, I cannot!\' she said, with a cheerless smile.\r\n\'Positively I cannot.  Will you make me a promise?\'\r\n\r\n\'What is it?\'\r\n\r\n\'I want you to promise first--  Yes, it is dreadfully unreasonable,\' she\r\nadded, in a mild distress.  \'But do promise!\'\r\n\r\nJohn by this time seemed to have a feeling that it was all up with him\r\nfor the present.  \'I promise,\' he said listlessly.\r\n\r\n\'It is that you won\'t speak to me about this for _ever_ so long,\' she\r\nreturned, with emphatic kindliness.\r\n\r\n\'Very good,\' he replied; \'very good.  Dear Anne, you don\'t think I have\r\nbeen unmanly or unfair in starting this anew?\'\r\n\r\nAnne looked into his face without a smile.  \'You have been perfectly\r\nnatural,\' she murmured.  \'And so I think have I.\'\r\n\r\nJohn, mournfully: \'You will not avoid me for this, or be afraid of me?  I\r\nwill not break my word.  I will not worry you any more.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, John.  You need not have said worry; it isn\'t that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I am very blind and stupid.  I have been hurting your heart all\r\nthe time without knowing it.  It is my fate, I suppose.  Men who love\r\nwomen the very best always blunder and give more pain than those who love\r\nthem less.\'\r\n\r\nAnne laid one of her hands on the other as she softly replied, looking\r\ndown at them, \'No one loves me as well as you, John; nobody in the world\r\nis so worthy to be loved; and yet I cannot anyhow love you rightly.\'  And\r\nlifting her eyes, \'But I do so feel for you that I will try as hard as I\r\ncan to think about you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, that is something,\' he said, smiling.  \'You say I must not speak\r\nabout it again for ever so long; how long?\'\r\n\r\n\'Now that\'s not fair,\' Anne retorted, going down the garden, and leaving\r\nhim alone.\r\n\r\nAbout a week passed.  Then one afternoon the miller walked up to Anne\r\nindoors, a weighty topic being expressed in his tread.\r\n\r\n\'I was so glad, my honey,\' he began, with a knowing smile, \'to see that\r\nfrom the mill-window last week.\'  He flung a nod in the direction of the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nAnne innocently inquired what it could be.\r\n\r\n\'Jack and you in the garden together,\' he continued laying his hand\r\ngently on her shoulder and stroking it.  \'It would so please me, my dear\r\nlittle girl, if you could get to like him better than that weathercock,\r\nMaster Bob.\'\r\n\r\nAnne shook her head; not in forcible negation, but to imply a kind of\r\nneutrality.\r\n\r\n\'Can\'t you?  Come now,\' said the miller.\r\n\r\nShe threw back her head with a little laugh of grievance.  \'How you all\r\nbeset me!\' she expostulated.  \'It makes me feel very wicked in not\r\nobeying you, and being faithful--faithful to--\'  But she could not trust\r\nthat side of the subject to words.  \'Why would it please you so much?\'\r\nshe asked.\r\n\r\n\'John is as steady and staunch a fellow as ever blowed a trumpet.  I\'ve\r\nalways thought you might do better with him than with Bob.  Now I\'ve a\r\nplan for taking him into the mill, and letting him have a comfortable\r\ntime o\'t after his long knocking about; but so much depends upon you that\r\nI must bide a bit till I see what your pleasure is about the poor fellow.\r\nMind, my dear, I don\'t want to force ye; I only just ask ye.\'\r\n\r\nAnne meditatively regarded the miller from under her shady eyelids, the\r\nfingers of one hand playing a silent tattoo on her bosom.  \'I don\'t know\r\nwhat to say to you,\' she answered brusquely, and went away.\r\n\r\nBut these discourses were not without their effect upon the extremely\r\nconscientious mind of Anne.  They were, moreover, much helped by an\r\nincident which took place one evening in the autumn of this year, when\r\nJohn came to tea.  Anne was sitting on a low stool in front of the fire,\r\nher hands clasped across her knee.  John Loveday had just seated himself\r\non a chair close behind her, and Mrs. Loveday was in the act of filling\r\nthe teapot from the kettle which hung in the chimney exactly above Anne.\r\nThe kettle slipped forward suddenly, whereupon John jumped from the chair\r\nand put his own two hands over Anne\'s just in time to shield them, and\r\nthe precious knee she clasped, from the jet of scalding water which had\r\ndirected itself upon that point.  The accidental overflow was instantly\r\nchecked by Mrs. Loveday; but what had come was received by the devoted\r\ntrumpet-major on the back of his hands.\r\n\r\nAnne, who had hardly been aware that he was behind her, started up like a\r\nperson awakened from a trance.  \'What have you done to yourself, poor\r\nJohn, to keep it off me!\' she cried, looking at his hands.\r\n\r\nJohn reddened emotionally at her words, \'It is a bit of a scald, that\'s\r\nall,\' he replied, drawing a finger across the back of one hand, and\r\nbringing off the skin by the touch.\r\n\r\n\'You are scalded painfully, and I not at all!\'  She gazed into his kind\r\nface as she had never gazed there before, and when Mrs. Loveday came back\r\nwith oil and other liniments for the wound Anne would let nobody dress it\r\nbut herself.  It seemed as if her coyness had all gone, and when she had\r\ndone all that lay in her power she still sat by him.  At his departure\r\nshe said what she had never said to him in her life before: \'Come again\r\nsoon!\'\r\n\r\nIn short, that impulsive act of devotion, the last of a series of the\r\nsame tenor, had been the added drop which finally turned the wheel.\r\nJohn\'s character deeply impressed her.  His determined steadfastness to\r\nhis lode star won her admiration, the more especially as that star was\r\nherself.  She began to wonder more and more how she could have so\r\npersistently held out against his advances before Bob came home to renew\r\ngirlish memories which had by that time got considerably weakened.  Could\r\nshe not, after all, please the miller, and try to listen to John?  By so\r\ndoing she would make a worthy man happy, the only sacrifice being at\r\nworst that of her unworthy self, whose future was no longer valuable.  \'As\r\nfor Bob, the woman is to be pitied who loves him,\' she reflected\r\nindignantly, and persuaded herself that, whoever the woman might be, she\r\nwas not Anne Garland.\r\n\r\nAfter this there was something of recklessness and something of\r\npleasantry in the young girl\'s manner of making herself an example of the\r\ntriumph of pride and common sense over memory and sentiment.  Her\r\nattitude had been epitomized in her defiant singing at the time she\r\nlearnt that Bob was not leal and true.  John, as was inevitable, came\r\nagain almost immediately, drawn thither by the sun of her first smile on\r\nhim, and the words which had accompanied it.  And now instead of going\r\noff to her little pursuits upstairs, downstairs, across the room, in the\r\ncorner, or to any place except where he happened to be, as had been her\r\ncustom hitherto, she remained seated near him, returning interesting\r\nanswers to his general remarks, and at every opportunity letting him know\r\nthat at last he had found favour in her eyes.\r\n\r\nThe day was fine, and they went out of doors, where Anne endeavoured to\r\nseat herself on the sloping stone of the window-sill.\r\n\r\n\'How good you have become lately,\' said John, standing over her and\r\nsmiling in the sunlight which blazed against the wall.  \'I fancy you have\r\nstayed at home this afternoon on my account.\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps I have,\' she said gaily--\r\n\r\n   \'"Do whatever we may for him, dame, we cannot do too much!\r\n      For he\'s one that has guarded our land."\r\n\r\n\'And he has done more than that: he has saved me from a dreadful\r\nscalding.  The back of your hand will not be well for a long time, John,\r\nwill it?\'\r\n\r\nHe held out his hand to regard its condition, and the next natural thing\r\nwas to take hers.  There was a glow upon his face when he did it: his\r\nstar was at last on a fair way towards the zenith after its long and\r\nweary declination.  The least penetrating eye could have perceived that\r\nAnne had resolved to let him woo, possibly in her temerity to let him\r\nwin.  Whatever silent sorrow might be locked up in her, it was by this\r\ntime thrust a long way down from the light.\r\n\r\n\'I want you to go somewhere with me if you will,\' he said, still holding\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\n\'Yes?  Where is it?\'\r\n\r\nHe pointed to a distant hill-side which, hitherto green, had within the\r\nlast few days begun to show scratches of white on its face.  \'Up there,\'\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n\'I see little figures of men moving about.  What are they doing?\'\r\n\r\n\'Cutting out a huge picture of the king on horseback in the earth of the\r\nhill.  The king\'s head is to be as big as our mill-pond and his body as\r\nbig as this garden; he and the horse will cover more than an acre.  When\r\nshall we go?\'\r\n\r\n\'Whenever you please,\' said she.\r\n\r\n\'John!\' cried Mrs. Loveday from the front door.  \'Here\'s a friend come\r\nfor you.\'\r\n\r\nJohn went round, and found his trusty lieutenant, Trumpeter Buck, waiting\r\nfor him.  A letter had come to the barracks for John in his absence, and\r\nthe trumpeter, who was going for a walk, had brought it along with him.\r\nBuck then entered the mill to discuss, if possible, a mug of last year\'s\r\nmead with the miller; and John proceeded to read his letter, Anne being\r\nstill round the corner where he had left her.  When he had read a few\r\nwords he turned as pale as a sheet, but he did not move, and perused the\r\nwriting to the end.\r\n\r\nAfterwards he laid his elbow against the wall, and put his palm to his\r\nhead, thinking with painful intentness.  Then he took himself vigorously\r\nin hand, as it were, and gradually became natural again.  When he parted\r\nfrom Anne to go home with Buck she noticed nothing different in him.\r\n\r\nIn barracks that evening he read the letter again.  It was from Bob; and\r\nthe agitating contents were these:--\r\n\r\n   \'DEAR JOHN,--I have drifted off from writing till the present time\r\n   because I have not been clear about my feelings; but I have discovered\r\n   them at last, and can say beyond doubt that I mean to be faithful to\r\n   my dearest Anne after all.  The fact is, John, I\'ve got into a bit of\r\n   a scrape, and I\'ve a secret to tell you about it (which must go no\r\n   further on any account).  On landing last autumn I fell in with a\r\n   young woman, and we got rather warm as folks do; in short, we liked\r\n   one another well enough for a while.  But I have got into shoal water\r\n   with her, and have found her to be a terrible take-in.  Nothing in her\r\n   at all--no sense, no niceness, all tantrums and empty noise, John,\r\n   though she seemed monstrous clever at first.  So my heart comes back\r\n   to its old anchorage.  I hope my return to faithfulness will make no\r\n   difference to you.  But as you showed by your looks at our parting\r\n   that you should not accept my offer to give her up--made in too much\r\n   haste, as I have since found--I feel that you won\'t mind that I have\r\n   returned to the path of honour.  I dare not write to Anne as yet, and\r\n   please do not let her know a word about the other young woman, or\r\n   there will be the devil to pay.  I shall come home and make all things\r\n   right, please God.  In the meantime I should take it as a kindness,\r\n   John, if you would keep a brotherly eye upon Anne, and guide her mind\r\n   back to me.  I shall die of sorrow if anybody sets her against me, for\r\n   my hopes are getting bound up in her again quite strong.  Hoping you\r\n   are jovial, as times go, I am,--Your affectionate brother,\r\n\r\n   ROBERT.\'\r\n\r\nWhen the cold daylight fell upon John\'s face, as he dressed himself next\r\nmorning, the incipient yesterday\'s wrinkle in his forehead had become\r\npermanently graven there.  He had resolved, for the sake of that only\r\nbrother whom he had nursed as a baby, instructed as a child, and\r\nprotected and loved always, to pause in his procedure for the present,\r\nand at least do nothing to hinder Bob\'s restoration to favour, if a\r\ngenuine, even though temporarily smothered, love for Anne should still\r\nhold possession of him.  But having arranged to take her to see the\r\nexcavated figure of the king, he started for Overcombe during the day, as\r\nif nothing had occurred to check the smooth course of his love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII.  A DELICATE SITUATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\'I am ready to go,\' said Anne, as soon as he arrived.\r\n\r\nHe paused as if taken aback by her readiness, and replied with much\r\nuncertainty, \'Would it--wouldn\'t it be better to put it off till there is\r\nless sun?\'\r\n\r\nThe very slightest symptom of surprise arose in her as she rejoined, \'But\r\nthe weather may change; or had we better not go at all?\'\r\n\r\n\'O no!--it was only a thought.  We will start at once.\'\r\n\r\nAnd along the vale they went, John keeping himself about a yard from her\r\nright hand.  When the third field had been crossed they came upon half-a-\r\ndozen little boys at play.\r\n\r\n\'Why don\'t he clasp her to his side, like a man?\' said the biggest and\r\nrudest boy.\r\n\r\n\'Why don\'t he clasp her to his side, like a man?\' echoed all the rude\r\nsmaller boys in a chorus.\r\n\r\nThe trumpet-major turned, and, after some running, succeeded in smacking\r\ntwo of them with his switch, returning to Anne breathless.  \'I am ashamed\r\nthey should have insulted you so,\' he said, blushing for her.\r\n\r\n\'They said no harm, poor boys,\' she replied reproachfully.\r\n\r\nPoor John was dumb with perception.  The gentle hint upon which he would\r\nhave eagerly spoken only one short day ago was now like fire to his\r\nwound.\r\n\r\nThey presently came to some stepping-stones across a brook.  John crossed\r\nfirst without turning his head, and Anne, just lifting the skirt of her\r\ndress, crossed behind him.  When they had reached the other side a\r\nvillage girl and a young shepherd approached the brink to cross.  Anne\r\nstopped and watched them.  The shepherd took a hand of the young girl in\r\neach of his own, and walked backward over the stones, facing her, and\r\nkeeping her upright by his grasp, both of them laughing as they went.\r\n\r\n\'What are you staying for, Miss Garland?\' asked John.\r\n\r\n\'I was only thinking how happy they are,\' she said quietly; and\r\nwithdrawing her eyes from the tender pair, she turned and followed him,\r\nnot knowing that the seeming sound of a passing bumble-bee was a\r\nsuppressed groan from John.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the hill they found forty navvies at work removing the\r\ndark sod so as to lay bare the chalk beneath.  The equestrian figure that\r\ntheir shovels were forming was scarcely intelligible to John and Anne now\r\nthey were close, and after pacing from the horse\'s head down his breast\r\nto his hoof, back by way of the king\'s bridle-arm, past the bridge of his\r\nnose, and into his cocked-hat, Anne said that she had had enough of it,\r\nand stepped out of the chalk clearing upon the grass.  The trumpet-major\r\nhad remained all the time in a melancholy attitude within the rowel of\r\nhis Majesty\'s right spur.\r\n\r\n\'My shoes are caked with chalk,\' she said as they walked downwards again;\r\nand she drew back her dress to look at them.  \'How can I get some of it\r\ncleared off?\'\r\n\r\n\'If you was to wipe them in the long grass there,\' said John, pointing to\r\na spot where the blades were rank and dense, \'some of it would come off.\'\r\nHaving said this, he walked on with religious firmness.\r\n\r\nAnne raked her little feet on the right side, on the left side, over the\r\ntoe, and behind the heel; but the tenacious chalk held its own.  Panting\r\nwith her exertion, she gave it up, and at length overtook him.\r\n\r\n\'I hope it is right now?\' he said, looking gingerly over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\'No, indeed!\' said she.  \'I wanted some assistance--some one to steady\r\nme.  It is so hard to stand on one foot and wipe the other without\r\nsupport.  I was in danger of toppling over, and so gave it up.\'\r\n\r\n\'Merciful stars, what an opportunity!\' thought the poor fellow while she\r\nwaited for him to offer help. But his lips remained closed, and she went\r\non with a pouting smile--\r\n\r\n\'You seem in such a hurry!  Why are you in such a hurry?  After all the\r\nfine things you have said about--about caring so much for me, and all\r\nthat, you won\'t stop for anything!\'\r\n\r\nIt was too much for John.  \'Upon my heart and life, my dea--\' he began.\r\nHere Bob\'s letter crackled warningly in his waistcoat pocket as he laid\r\nhis hand asseveratingly upon his breast, and he became suddenly scaled up\r\nto dumbness and gloom as before.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached home Anne sank upon a stool outside the door, fatigued\r\nwith her excursion.  Her first act was to try to pull off her shoe--it\r\nwas a difficult matter; but John stood beating with his switch the leaves\r\nof the creeper on the wall.\r\n\r\n\'Mother--David--Molly, or somebody--do come and help me pull off these\r\ndirty shoes!\' she cried aloud at last.  \'Nobody helps me in anything!\'\r\n\r\n\'I am very sorry,\' said John, coming towards her with incredible slowness\r\nand an air of unutterable depression.\r\n\r\n\'O, I can do without _you_.  David is best,\' she returned, as the old man\r\napproached and removed the obnoxious shoes in a trice.\r\n\r\nAnne was amazed at this sudden change from devotion to crass\r\nindifference.  On entering her room she flew to the glass, almost\r\nexpecting to learn that some extraordinary change had come over her\r\npretty countenance, rendering her intolerable for evermore.  But it was,\r\nif anything, fresher than usual, on account of the exercise.  \'Well!\' she\r\nsaid retrospectively.  For the first time since their acqaintance she had\r\nthis week encouraged him; and for the first time he had shown that\r\nencouragement was useless.  \'But perhaps he does not clearly understand,\'\r\nshe added serenely.\r\n\r\nWhen he next came it was, to her surprise, to bring her newspapers, now\r\nfor some time discontinued.  As soon as she saw them she said, \'I do not\r\ncare for newspapers.\'\r\n\r\n\'The shipping news is very full and long to-day, though the print is\r\nrather small.\'\r\n\r\n\'I take no further interest in the shipping news,\' she replied with cold\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\nShe was sitting by the window, inside the table, and hence when, in spite\r\nof her negations, he deliberately unfolded the paper and began to read\r\nabout the Royal Navy she could hardly rise and go away.  With a stoical\r\nmien he read on to the end of the report, bringing out the name of Bob\'s\r\nship with tremendous force.\r\n\r\n\'No,\' she said at last, \'I\'ll hear no more!  Let me read to you.\'\r\n\r\nThe trumpet-major sat down.  Anne turned to the military news, delivering\r\nevery detail with much apparent enthusiasm.  \'That\'s the subject _I_\r\nlike!\' she said fervently.\r\n\r\n\'But--but Bob is in the navy now, and will most likely rise to be an\r\nofficer.  And then--\'\r\n\r\n\'What is there like the army?\' she interrupted.  \'There is no smartness\r\nabout sailors.  They waddle like ducks, and they only fight stupid\r\nbattles that no one can form any idea of.  There is no science nor\r\nstratagem in sea-fights--nothing more than what you see when two rams run\r\ntheir heads together in a field to knock each other down.  But in\r\nmilitary battles there is such art, and such splendour, and the men are\r\nso smart, particularly the horse-soldiers.  O, I shall never forget what\r\ngallant men you all seemed when you came and pitched your tents on the\r\ndowns!  I like the cavalry better than anything I know; and the dragoons\r\nthe best of the cavalry--and the trumpeters the best of the dragoons!\'\r\n\r\n\'O, if it had but come a little sooner!\' moaned John within him.  He\r\nreplied as soon as he could regain self-command, \'I am glad Bob is in the\r\nnavy at last--he is so much more fitted for that than the\r\nmerchant-service--so brave by nature, ready for any daring deed.  I have\r\nheard ever so much more about his doings on board the Victory.  Captain\r\nHardy took special notice that when he--\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t want to know anything more about it,\' said Anne impatiently; \'of\r\ncourse sailors fight; there\'s nothing else to do in a ship, since you\r\ncan\'t run away!  You may as well fight and be killed as be killed not\r\nfighting.\'\r\n\r\n\'Still it is his character to be careless of himself where the honour of\r\nhis country is concerned,\' John pleaded.  \'If you had only known him as a\r\nboy you would own it.  He would always risk his own life to save anybody\r\nelse\'s.  Once when a cottage was afire up the lane he rushed in for a\r\nbaby, although he was only a boy himself, and he had the narrowest\r\nescape.  We have got his hat now with the hole burnt in it.  Shall I get\r\nit and show it to you?\'\r\n\r\n\'No--I don\'t wish it.  It has nothing to do with me.\'  But as he\r\npersisted in his course towards the door, she added, \'Ah! you are leaving\r\nbecause I am in your way.  You want to be alone while you read the\r\npaper--I will go at once.  I did not see that I was interrupting you.\'\r\nAnd she rose as if to retreat.\r\n\r\n\'No, no!  I would rather be interrupted by _you_ than--O, Miss Garland,\r\nexcuse me!  I\'ll just speak to father in the mill, now I am here.\'\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to state that Anne (whose unquestionable\r\ngentility amid somewhat homely surroundings has been many times insisted\r\non in the course of this history) was usually the reverse of a woman with\r\na coming-on disposition; but, whether from pique at his manner, or from\r\nwilful adherence to a course rashly resolved on, or from coquettish\r\nmaliciousness in reaction from long depression, or from any other\r\nthing,--so it was that she would not let him go.\r\n\r\n\'Trumpet-major,\' she said, recalling him.\r\n\r\n\'Yes?\' he replied timidly.\r\n\r\n\'The bow of my cap-ribbon has come untied, has it not?\'  She turned and\r\nfixed her bewitching glance upon him.\r\n\r\nThe bow was just over her forehead, or, more precisely, at the point\r\nwhere the organ of comparison merges in that of benevolence, according to\r\nthe phrenological theory of Gall.  John, thus brought to, endeavoured to\r\nlook at the bow in a skimming, duck-and-drake fashion, so as to avoid\r\ndipping his own glance as far as to the plane of his interrogator\'s eyes.\r\n\'It is untied,\' he said, drawing back a little.\r\n\r\nShe came nearer, and asked, \'Will you tie it for me, please?\'\r\n\r\nAs there was no help for it, he nerved himself and assented.  As her head\r\nonly reached to his fourth button she necessarily looked up for his\r\nconvenience, and John began fumbling at the bow.  Try as he would it was\r\nimpossible to touch the ribbon without getting his finger tips mixed with\r\nthe curls of her forehead.\r\n\r\n\'Your hand shakes--ah! you have been walking fast,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'Yes--yes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Have you almost done it?\'  She inquiringly directed her gaze upward\r\nthrough his fingers.\r\n\r\n\'No--not yet,\' he faltered in a warm sweat of emotion, his heart going\r\nlike a flail.\r\n\r\n\'Then be quick, please.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I will, Miss Garland!  B-B-Bob is a very good fel--\'\r\n\r\n\'Not that man\'s name to me!\' she interrupted.\r\n\r\nJohn was silent instantly, and nothing was to be heard but the rustling\r\nof the ribbon; till his hands once more blundered among the curls, and\r\nthen touched her forehead.\r\n\r\n\'O good God!\' ejaculated the trumpet-major in a whisper, turning away\r\nhastily to the corner-cupboard, and resting his face upon his hand.\r\n\r\n\'What\'s the matter, John?\' said she.\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t do it!\'\r\n\r\n\'What?\'\r\n\r\n\'Tie your cap-ribbon.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why not?\'\r\n\r\n\'Because you are so--Because I am clumsy, and never could tie a bow.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are clumsy indeed,\' answered Anne, and went away.\r\n\r\nAfter this she felt injured, for it seemed to show that he rated her\r\nhappiness as of meaner value than Bob\'s; since he had persisted in his\r\nidea of giving Bob another chance when she had implied that it was her\r\nwish to do otherwise.  Could Miss Johnson have anything to do with his\r\nfirmness?  An opportunity of testing him in this direction occurred some\r\ndays later.  She had been up the village, and met John at the mill-door.\r\n\r\n\'Have you heard the news?  Matilda Johnson is going to be married to\r\nyoung Derriman.\'\r\n\r\nAnne stood with her back to the sun, and as he faced her, his features\r\nwere searchingly exhibited.  There was no change whatever in them, unless\r\nit were that a certain light of interest kindled by her question turned\r\nto complete and blank indifference.  \'Well, as times go, it is not a bad\r\nmatch for her,\' he said, with a phlegm which was hardly that of a lover.\r\n\r\nJohn on his part was beginning to find these temptations almost more than\r\nhe could bear.  But being quartered so near to his father\'s house it was\r\nunnatural not to visit him, especially when at any moment the regiment\r\nmight be ordered abroad, and a separation of years ensue; and as long as\r\nhe went there he could not help seeing her.\r\n\r\nThe year changed from green to gold, and from gold to grey, but little\r\nchange came over the house of Loveday.  During the last twelve months Bob\r\nhad been occasionally heard of as upholding his country\'s honour in\r\nDenmark, the West Indies, Gibraltar, Malta, and other places about the\r\nglobe, till the family received a short letter stating that he had\r\narrived again at Portsmouth.  At Portsmouth Bob seemed disposed to\r\nremain, for though some time elapsed without further intelligence, the\r\ngallant seaman never appeared at Overcombe.  Then on a sudden John learnt\r\nthat Bob\'s long-talked-of promotion for signal services rendered was to\r\nbe an accomplished fact.  The trumpet-major at once walked off to\r\nOvercombe, and reached the village in the early afternoon.  Not one of\r\nthe family was in the house at the moment, and John strolled onwards over\r\nthe hill towards Casterbridge, without much thought of direction till,\r\nlifting his eyes, he beheld Anne Garland wandering about with a little\r\nbasket upon her arm.\r\n\r\nAt first John blushed with delight at the sweet vision; but, recalled by\r\nhis conscience, the blush of delight was at once mangled and slain.  He\r\nlooked for a means of retreat.  But the field was open, and a soldier was\r\na conspicuous object: there was no escaping her.\r\n\r\n\'It was kind of you to come,\' she said, with an inviting smile.\r\n\r\n\'It was quite by accident,\' he answered, with an indifferent laugh.  \'I\r\nthought you was at home.\'\r\n\r\nAnne blushed and said nothing, and they rambled on together.  In the\r\nmiddle of the field rose a fragment of stone wall in the form of a gable,\r\nknown as Faringdon Ruin; and when they had reached it John paused and\r\npolitely asked her if she were not a little tired with walking so far.  No\r\nparticular reply was returned by the young lady, but they both stopped,\r\nand Anne seated herself on a stone, which had fallen from the ruin to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\'A church once stood here,\' observed John in a matter-of-fact tone.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I have often shaped it out in my mind,\' she returned.  \'Here where\r\nI sit must have been the altar.\'\r\n\r\n\'True; this standing bit of wall was the chancel end.\'\r\n\r\nAnne had been adding up her little studies of the trumpet-major\'s\r\ncharacter, and was surprised to find how the brightness of that character\r\nincreased in her eyes with each examination.  A kindly and gentle\r\nsensation was again aroused in her.  Here was a neglected heroic man,\r\nwho, loving her to distraction, deliberately doomed himself to pensive\r\nshade to avoid even the appearance of standing in a brother\'s way.\r\n\r\n\'If the altar stood here, hundreds of people have been made man and wife\r\njust there, in past times,\' she said, with calm deliberateness, throwing\r\na little stone on a spot about a yard westward.\r\n\r\nJohn annihilated another tender burst and replied, \'Yes, this field used\r\nto be a village.  My grandfather could call to mind when there were\r\nhouses here.  But the squire pulled \'em down, because poor folk were an\r\neyesore to him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you know, John, what you once asked me to do?\' she continued, not\r\naccepting the digression, and turning her eyes upon him.\r\n\r\n\'In what sort of way?\'\r\n\r\n\'In the matter of my future life, and yours.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am afraid I don\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'John Loveday!\'\r\n\r\nHe turned his back upon her for a moment, that she might not see his\r\nface.  \'Ah--I do remember,\' he said at last, in a dry, small, repressed\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\'Well--need I say more?  Isn\'t it sufficient?\'\r\n\r\n\'It would be sufficient,\' answered the unhappy man.  \'But--\'\r\n\r\nShe looked up with a reproachful smile, and shook her head.  \'That\r\nsummer,\' she went on, \'you asked me ten times if you asked me once.  I am\r\nolder now; much more of a woman, you know; and my opinion is changed\r\nabout some people; especially about one.\'\r\n\r\n\'O Anne, Anne!\' he burst out as, racked between honour and desire, he\r\nsnatched up her hand.  The next moment it fell heavily to her lap.  He\r\nhad absolutely relinquished it half-way to his lips.\r\n\r\n\'I have been thinking lately,\' he said, with preternaturally sudden\r\ncalmness, \'that men of the military profession ought not to m--ought to\r\nbe like St. Paul, I mean.\'\r\n\r\n\'Fie, John; pretending religion!\' she said sternly.  \'It isn\'t that at\r\nall.  _It\'s Bob_!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes!\' cried the miserable trumpet-major.  \'I have had a letter from him\r\nto-day.\' He pulled out a sheet of paper from his breast.  \'That\'s it!\r\nHe\'s promoted--he\'s a lieutenant, and appointed to a sloop that only\r\ncruises on our own coast, so that he\'ll be at home on leave half his\r\ntime--he\'ll be a gentleman some day, and worthy of you!\'\r\n\r\nHe threw the letter into her lap, and drew back to the other side of the\r\ngable-wall.  Anne jumped up from her seat, flung away the letter without\r\nlooking at it, and went hastily on.  John did not attempt to overtake\r\nher.  Picking up the letter, he followed in her wake at a distance of a\r\nhundred yards.\r\n\r\nBut, though Anne had withdrawn from his presence thus precipitately, she\r\nnever thought more highly of him in her life than she did five minutes\r\nafterwards, when the excitement of the moment had passed.  She saw it all\r\nquite clearly; and his self-sacrifice impressed her so much that the\r\neffect was just the reverse of what he had been aiming to produce.  The\r\nmore he pleaded for Bob, the more her perverse generosity pleaded for\r\nJohn.  To-day the crisis had come--with what results she had not\r\nforeseen.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the trumpet-major reached the nearest pen-and-ink he flung\r\nhimself into a seat and wrote wildly to Bob:--\r\n\r\n   \'DEAR ROBERT,--I write these few lines to let you know that if you\r\n   want Anne Garland you must come at once--you must come instantly, and\r\n   post-haste--_or she will be gone_!  Somebody else wants her, and she\r\n   wants him!  It is your last chance, in the opinion of--\r\n\r\n   \'Your faithful brother and well-wisher,\r\n   \'JOHN.\r\n\r\n   \'P.S.--Glad to hear of your promotion.  Tell me the day and I\'ll meet\r\n   the coach.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX.  BOB LOVEDAY STRUTS UP AND DOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nOne night, about a week later, two men were walking in the dark along the\r\nturnpike road towards Overcombe, one of them with a bag in his hand.\r\n\r\n\'Now,\' said the taller of the two, the squareness of whose shoulders\r\nsignified that he wore epaulettes, \'now you must do the best you can for\r\nyourself, Bob.  I have done all I can; but th\'hast thy work cut out, I\r\ncan tell thee.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wouldn\'t have run such a risk for the world,\' said the other, in a\r\ntone of ingenuous contrition.  \'But thou\'st see, Jack, I didn\'t think\r\nthere was any danger, knowing you was taking care of her, and keeping my\r\nplace warm for me.  I didn\'t hurry myself, that\'s true; but, thinks I, if\r\nI get this promotion I am promised I shall naturally have leave, and then\r\nI\'ll go and see \'em all.  Gad, I shouldn\'t have been here now but for\r\nyour letter!\'\r\n\r\n\'You little think what risks you\'ve run,\' said his brother.  \'However,\r\ntry to make up for lost time.\'\r\n\r\n\'All right.  And whatever you do, Jack, don\'t say a word about this other\r\ngirl.  Hang the girl!--I was a great fool, I know; still, it is over now,\r\nand I am come to my senses.  I suppose Anne never caught a capful of wind\r\nfrom that quarter?\'\r\n\r\n\'She knows all about it,\' said John seriously.\r\n\r\n\'Knows?  By George, then, I\'m ruined!\' said Bob, standing stock-still in\r\nthe road as if he meant to remain there all night.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s what I meant by saying it would be a hard battle for \'ee,\'\r\nreturned John, with the same quietness as before.\r\n\r\nBob sighed and moved on.  \'I don\'t deserve that woman!\' he cried\r\npassionately, thumping his three upper ribs with his fist.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve thought as much myself,\' observed John, with a dryness which was\r\nalmost bitter.  \'But it depends on how thou\'st behave in future.\'\r\n\r\n\'John,\' said Bob, taking his brother\'s hand, \'I\'ll be a new man.  I\r\nsolemnly swear by that eternal milestone staring at me there that I\'ll\r\nnever look at another woman with the thought of marrying her whilst that\r\ndarling is free--no, not if she be a mermaiden of light!  It\'s a lucky\r\nthing that I\'m slipped in on the quarterdeck! it may help me with\r\nher--hey?\'\r\n\r\n\'It may with her mother; I don\'t think it will make much difference with\r\nAnne.  Still, it is a good thing; and I hope that some day you\'ll command\r\na big ship.\'\r\n\r\nBob shook his head.  \'Officers are scarce; but I\'m afraid my luck won\'t\r\ncarry me so far as that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did she ever tell you that she mentioned your name to the King?\'\r\n\r\nThe seaman stood still again.  \'Never!\' he said.  \'How did such a thing\r\nas that happen, in Heaven\'s name?\'\r\n\r\nJohn described in detail, and they walked on, lost in conjecture.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they entered the house the returned officer of the navy was\r\nwelcomed with acclamation by his father and David, with mild approval by\r\nMrs. Loveday, and by Anne not at all--that discreet maiden having\r\ncarefully retired to her own room some time earlier in the evening.  Bob\r\ndid not dare to ask for her in any positive manner; he just inquired\r\nabout her health, and that was all.\r\n\r\n\'Why, what\'s the matter with thy face, my son?\' said the miller, staring.\r\n\'David, show a light here.\'  And a candle was thrust against Bob\'s cheek,\r\nwhere there appeared a jagged streak like the geological remains of a\r\nlobster.\r\n\r\n\'O--that\'s where that rascally Frenchman\'s grenade busted and hit me from\r\nthe Redoubtable, you know, as I told \'ee in my letter.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not a word!\'\r\n\r\n\'What, didn\'t I tell \'ee?  Ah, no; I meant to, but I forgot it.\'\r\n\r\n\'And here\'s a sort of dint in yer forehead too; what do that mean, my\r\ndear boy?\' said the miller, putting his finger in a chasm in Bob\'s skull.\r\n\r\n\'That was done in the Indies.  Yes, that was rather a troublesome chop--a\r\ncutlass did it.  I should have told \'ee, but I found \'twould make my\r\nletter so long that I put it off, and put it off; and at last thought it\r\nwasn\'t worth while.\'\r\n\r\nJohn soon rose to take his departure.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s all up with me and her, you see,\' said Bob to him outside the door.\r\n\'She\'s not even going to see me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wait a little,\' said the trumpet-major.  It was easy enough on the night\r\nof the arrival, in the midst of excitement, when blood was warm, for Anne\r\nto be resolute in her avoidance of Bob Loveday.  But in the morning\r\ndetermination is apt to grow invertebrate; rules of pugnacity are less\r\neasily acted up to, and a feeling of live and let live takes possession\r\nof the gentle soul.  Anne had not meant even to sit down to the same\r\nbreakfast-table with Bob; but when the rest were assembled, and had got\r\nsome way through the substantial repast which was served at this hour in\r\nthe miller\'s house, Anne entered.  She came silently as a phantom, her\r\neyes cast down, her cheeks pale.  It was a good long walk from the door\r\nto the table, and Bob made a full inspection of her as she came up to a\r\nchair at the remotest corner, in the direct rays of the morning light,\r\nwhere she dumbly sat herself down.\r\n\r\nIt was altogether different from how she had expected.  Here was she, who\r\nhad done nothing, feeling all the embarrassment; and Bob, who had done\r\nthe wrong, feeling apparently quite at ease.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll speak to Bob, won\'t you, honey?\' said the miller after a silence.\r\nTo meet Bob like this after an absence seemed irregular in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\'If he wish me to,\' she replied, so addressing the miller that no part,\r\nscrap, or outlying beam whatever of her glance passed near the subject of\r\nher remark.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s a lieutenant, you know, dear,\' said her mother on the same side;\r\n\'and he\'s been dreadfully wounded.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh?\' said Anne, turning a little towards the false one; at which Bob\r\nfelt it to be time for him to put in a spoke for himself.\r\n\r\n\'I am glad to see you,\' he said contritely; \'and how do you do?\'\r\n\r\n\'Very well, thank you.\'\r\n\r\nHe extended his hand.  She allowed him to take hers, but only to the\r\nextent of a niggardly inch or so.  At the same moment she glanced up at\r\nhim, when their eyes met, and hers were again withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe hitch between the two younger members of the household tended to make\r\nthe breakfast a dull one.  Bob was so depressed by her unforgiving manner\r\nthat he could not throw that sparkle into his stories which their\r\nsubstance naturally required; and when the meal was over, and they went\r\nabout their different businesses, the pair resembled the two Dromios in\r\nseldom or never being, thanks to Anne\'s subtle contrivances, both in the\r\nsame room at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis kind of performance repeated itself during several days.  At last,\r\nafter dogging her hither and thither, leaning with a wrinkled forehead\r\nagainst doorposts, taking an oblique view into the room where she\r\nhappened to be, picking up worsted balls and getting no thanks, placing a\r\nsplinter from the Victory, several bullets from the Redoubtable, a strip\r\nof the flag, and other interesting relics, carefully labelled, upon her\r\ntable, and hearing no more about them than if they had been pebbles from\r\nthe nearest brook, he hit upon a new plan.  To avoid him she frequently\r\nsat upstairs in a window overlooking the garden.  Lieutenant Loveday\r\ncarefully dressed himself in a new uniform, which he had caused to be\r\nsent some days before, to dazzle admiring friends, but which he had never\r\nas yet put on in public or mentioned to a soul.  When arrayed he entered\r\nthe sunny garden, and there walked slowly up and down as he had seen\r\nNelson and Captain Hardy do on the quarter-deck; but keeping his right\r\nshoulder, on which his one epaulette was fixed, as much towards Anne\'s\r\nwindow as possible.\r\n\r\nBut she made no sign, though there was not the least question that she\r\nsaw him.  At the end of half-an-hour he went in, took off his clothes,\r\nand gave himself up to doubt and the best tobacco.\r\n\r\nHe repeated the programme on the next afternoon, and on the next, never\r\nsaying a word within doors about his doings or his notice.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the results in Anne\'s chamber were not uninteresting.  She had\r\nbeen looking out on the first day, and was duly amazed to see a naval\r\nofficer in full uniform promenading in the path.  Finding it to be Bob,\r\nshe left the window with a sense that the scene was not for her; then,\r\nfrom mere curiosity, peeped out from behind the curtain.  Well, he was a\r\npretty spectacle, she admitted, relieved as his figure was by a dense\r\nmass of sunny, close-trimmed hedge, over which nasturtiums climbed in\r\nwild luxuriance; and if she could care for him one bit, which she\r\ncouldn\'t, his form would have been a delightful study, surpassing in\r\ninterest even its splendour on the memorable day of their visit to the\r\ntown theatre.  She called her mother; Mrs. Loveday came promptly.\r\n\r\n\'O, it is nothing,\' said Anne indifferently; \'only that Bob has got his\r\nuniform.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Loveday peeped out, and raised her hands with delight.  \'And he has\r\nnot said a word to us about it!  What a lovely epaulette!  I must call\r\nhis father.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, indeed.  As I take no interest in him I shall not let people come\r\ninto my room to admire him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, you called me,\' said her mother.\r\n\r\n\'It was because I thought you liked fine clothes.  It is what I don\'t\r\ncare for.\'\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this assertion she again looked out at Bob the next\r\nafternoon when his footsteps rustled on the gravel, and studied his\r\nappearance under all the varying angles of the sunlight, as if fine\r\nclothes and uniforms were not altogether a matter of indifference.  He\r\ncertainly was a splendid, gentlemanly, and gallant sailor from end to end\r\nof him; but then, what were a dashing presentment, a naval rank, and\r\ntelling scars, if a man was fickle-hearted?  However, she peeped on till\r\nthe fourth day, and then she did not peep.  The window was open, she\r\nlooked right out, and Bob knew that he had got a rise to his bait at\r\nlast.  He touched his hat to her, keeping his right shoulder forwards,\r\nand said, \'Good-day, Miss Garland,\' with a smile.\r\n\r\nAnne replied, \'Good-day,\' with funereal seriousness; and the acquaintance\r\nthus revived led to the interchange of a few words at supper-time, at\r\nwhich Mrs. Loveday nodded with satisfaction.  But Anne took especial care\r\nthat he should never meet her alone, and to insure this her ingenuity was\r\nin constant exercise.  There were so many nooks and windings on the\r\nmiller\'s rambling premises that she could never be sure he would not turn\r\nup within a foot of her, particularly as his thin shoes were almost\r\nnoiseless.\r\n\r\nOne fine afternoon she accompanied Molly in search of elderberries for\r\nmaking the family wine which was drunk by Mrs. Loveday, Anne, and anybody\r\nwho could not stand the rougher and stronger liquors provided by the\r\nmiller.  After walking rather a long distance over the down they came to\r\na grassy hollow, where elder-bushes in knots of twos and threes rose from\r\nan uneven bank and hung their heads towards the south, black and heavy\r\nwith bunches of fruit.  The charm of fruit-gathering to girls is enhanced\r\nin the case of elderberries by the inoffensive softness of the leaves,\r\nboughs, and bark, which makes getting into the branches easy and pleasant\r\nto the most indifferent climbers.  Anne and Molly had soon gathered a\r\nbasketful, and sending the servant home with it, Anne remained in the\r\nbush picking and throwing down bunch by bunch upon the grass.  She was so\r\nabsorbed in her occupation of pulling the twigs towards her, and the\r\nrustling of their leaves so filled her ears, that it was a great surprise\r\nwhen, on turning her head, she perceived a similar movement to her own\r\namong the boughs of the adjoining bush.\r\n\r\nAt first she thought they were disturbed by being partly in contact with\r\nthe boughs of her bush; but in a moment Robert Loveday\'s face peered from\r\nthem, at a distance of about a yard from her own.  Anne uttered a little\r\nindignant \'Well!\' recovered herself, and went on plucking.  Bob thereupon\r\nwent on plucking likewise.\r\n\r\n\'I am picking elderberries for your mother,\' said the lieutenant at last,\r\nhumbly.\r\n\r\n\'So I see.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I happen to have come to the next bush to yours.\'\r\n\r\n\'So I see; but not the reason why.\'\r\n\r\nAnne was now in the westernmost branches of the bush, and Bob had leant\r\nacross into the eastern branches of his.  In gathering he swayed towards\r\nher, back again, forward again.\r\n\r\n\'I beg pardon,\' he said, when a further swing than usual had taken him\r\nalmost in contact with her.\r\n\r\n\'Then why do you do it?\'\r\n\r\n\'The wind rocks the bough, and the bough rocks me.\'  She expressed by a\r\nlook her opinion of this statement in the face of the gentlest breeze;\r\nand Bob pursued: \'I am afraid the berries will stain your pretty hands.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wear gloves.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, that\'s a plan I should never have thought of.  Can I help you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not at all.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are offended: that\'s what that means.\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'Then will you shake hands?\'\r\n\r\nAnne hesitated; then slowly stretched out her hand, which he took at\r\nonce.  \'That will do,\' she said, finding that he did not relinquish it\r\nimmediately.  But as he still held it, she pulled, the effect of which\r\nwas to draw Bob\'s swaying person, bough and all, towards her, and herself\r\ntowards him.\r\n\r\n\'I am afraid to let go your hand,\' said that officer, \'for if I do your\r\nspar will fly back, and you will be thrown upon the deck with great\r\nviolence.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wish you to let me go!\'\r\n\r\nHe accordingly did, and she flew back, but did not by any means fall.\r\n\r\n\'It reminds me of the times when I used to be aloft clinging to a yard\r\nnot much bigger than this tree-stem, in the mid-Atlantic, and thinking\r\nabout you.  I could see you in my fancy as plain as I see you now.\'\r\n\r\n\'Me, or some other woman!\' retorted Anne haughtily.\r\n\r\n\'No!\' declared Bob, shaking the bush for emphasis, \'I\'ll protest that I\r\ndid not think of anybody but you all the time we were dropping down\r\nchannel, all the time we were off Cadiz, all the time through battles and\r\nbombardments.  I seemed to see you in the smoke, and, thinks I, if I go\r\nto Davy\'s locker, what will she do?\'\r\n\r\n\'You didn\'t think that when you landed after Trafalgar.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, now,\' said the lieutenant in a reasoning tone; \'that was a curious\r\nthing.  You\'ll hardly believe it, maybe; but when a man is away from the\r\nwoman he loves best in the port--world, I mean--he can have a sort of\r\ntemporary feeling for another without disturbing the old one, which flows\r\nalong under the same as ever.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t believe it, and won\'t,\' said Anne firmly.\r\n\r\nMolly now appeared with the empty basket, and when it had been filled\r\nfrom the heap on the grass, Anne went home with her, bidding Loveday a\r\nfrigid adieu.\r\n\r\nThe same evening, when Bob was absent, the miller proposed that they\r\nshould all three go to an upper window of the house, to get a distant\r\nview of some rockets and illuminations which were to be exhibited in the\r\ntown and harbour in honour of the King, who had returned this year as\r\nusual.  They accordingly went upstairs to an empty attic, placed chairs\r\nagainst the window, and put out the light; Anne sitting in the middle,\r\nher mother close by, and the miller behind, smoking.  No sign of any\r\npyrotechnic display was visible over the port as yet, and Mrs. Loveday\r\npassed the time by talking to the miller, who replied in monosyllables.\r\nWhile this was going on Anne fancied that she heard some one approach,\r\nand presently felt sure that Bob was drawing near her in the surrounding\r\ndarkness; but as the other two had noticed nothing she said not a word.\r\n\r\nAll at once the swarthy expanse of southward sky was broken by the blaze\r\nof several rockets simultaneously ascending from different ships in the\r\nroads.  At the very same moment a warm mysterious hand slipped round her\r\nown, and gave it a gentle squeeze.\r\n\r\n\'O dear!\' said Anne, with a sudden start away.\r\n\r\n\'How nervous you are, child, to be startled by fireworks so far off,\'\r\nsaid Mrs. Loveday.\r\n\r\n\'I never saw rockets before,\' murmured Anne, recovering from her\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nMrs. Loveday presently spoke again.  \'I wonder what has become of Bob?\'\r\n\r\nAnne did not reply, being much exercised in trying to get her hand away\r\nfrom the one that imprisoned it; and whatever the miller thought he kept\r\nto himself, because it disturbed his smoking to speak.\r\n\r\nAnother batch of rockets went up.  \'O I never!\' said Anne, in a\r\nhalf-suppressed tone, springing in her chair.  A second hand had with the\r\nrise of the rockets leapt round her waist.\r\n\r\n\'Poor girl, you certainly must have change of scene at this rate,\' said\r\nMrs. Loveday.\r\n\r\n\'I suppose I must,\' murmured the dutiful daughter.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes nothing further occurred to disturb Anne\'s serenity.\r\nThen a slow, quiet \'a-hem\' came from the obscurity of the apartment.\r\n\r\n\'What, Bob?  How long have you been there?\' inquired Mrs. Loveday.\r\n\r\n\'Not long,\' said the lieutenant coolly.  \'I heard you were all here, and\r\ncrept up quietly, not to disturb ye.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why don\'t you wear heels to your shoes like Christian people, and not\r\ncreep about so like a cat?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, it keeps your floors clean to go slip-shod.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s true.\'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Anne was gently but firmly trying to pull Bob\'s arm from her\r\nwaist, her distressful difficulty being that in freeing her waist she\r\nenslaved her hand, and in getting her hand free she enslaved her waist.\r\nFinding the struggle a futile one, owing to the invisibility of her\r\nantagonist, and her wish to keep its nature secret from the other two,\r\nshe arose, and saying that she did not care to see any more, felt her way\r\ndownstairs.  Bob followed, leaving Loveday and his wife to themselves.\r\n\r\n\'Dear Anne,\' he began, when he had got down, and saw her in the candle-\r\nlight of the large room.  But she adroitly passed out at the other door,\r\nat which he took a candle and followed her to the small room.  \'Dear\r\nAnne, do let me speak,\' he repeated, as soon as the rays revealed her\r\nfigure.  But she passed into the bakehouse before he could say more;\r\nwhereupon he perseveringly did the same.  Looking round for her here he\r\nperceived her at the end of the room, where there were no means of exit\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\n\'Dear Anne,\' he began again, setting down the candle, \'you must try to\r\nforgive me; really you must.  I love you the best of anybody in the wide,\r\nwide world.  Try to forgive me; come!\'  And he imploringly took her hand.\r\n\r\nAnne\'s bosom began to surge and fall like a small tide, her eyes\r\nremaining fixed upon the floor; till, when Loveday ventured to draw her\r\nslightly towards him, she burst out crying.  \'I don\'t like you, Bob; I\r\ndon\'t!\' she suddenly exclaimed between her sobs.  \'I did once, but I\r\ndon\'t now--I can\'t, I can\'t; you have been very cruel to me!\'  She\r\nviolently turned away, weeping.\r\n\r\n\'I have, I have been terribly bad, I know,\' answered Bob,\r\nconscience-stricken by her grief.  \'But--if you could only forgive me--I\r\npromise that I\'ll never do anything to grieve \'ee again.  Do you forgive\r\nme, Anne?\'\r\n\r\nAnne\'s only reply was crying and shaking her head.\r\n\r\n\'Let\'s make it up.  Come, say we have made it up, dear.\'\r\n\r\nShe withdrew her hand, and still keeping her eyes buried in her\r\nhandkerchief, said \'No.\'\r\n\r\n\'Very well, then!\' exclaimed Bob, with sudden determination.  \'Now I know\r\nmy doom!  And whatever you hear of as happening to me, mind this, you\r\ncruel girl, that it is all your causing!\'  Saying this he strode with a\r\nhasty tread across the room into the passage and out at the door,\r\nslamming it loudly behind him.\r\n\r\nAnne suddenly looked up from her handkerchief, and stared with round wet\r\neyes and parted lips at the door by which he had gone.  Having remained\r\nwith suspended breath in this attitude for a few seconds she turned\r\nround, bent her head upon the table, and burst out weeping anew with\r\nthrice the violence of the former time.  It really seemed now as if her\r\ngrief would overwhelm her, all the emotions which had been suppressed,\r\nbottled up, and concealed since Bob\'s return having made themselves a\r\nsluice at last.\r\n\r\nBut such things have their end; and left to herself in the large, vacant,\r\nold apartment, she grew quieter, and at last calm.  At length she took\r\nthe candle and ascended to her bedroom, where she bathed her eyes and\r\nlooked in the glass to see if she had made herself a dreadful object.  It\r\nwas not so bad as she had expected, and she went downstairs again.\r\n\r\nNobody was there, and, sitting down, she wondered what Bob had really\r\nmeant by his words.  It was too dreadful to think that he intended to go\r\nstraight away to sea without seeing her again, and frightened at what she\r\nhad done she waited anxiously for his return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXL.  A CALL ON BUSINESS\r\n\r\n\r\nHer suspense was interrupted by a very gentle tapping at the door, and\r\nthen the rustle of a hand over its surface, as if searching for the latch\r\nin the dark.  The door opened a few inches, and the alabaster face of\r\nUncle Benjy appeared in the slit.\r\n\r\n\'O, Squire Derriman, you frighten me!\'\r\n\r\n\'All alone?\' he asked in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\'My mother and Mr. Loveday are somewhere about the house.\'\r\n\r\n\'That will do,\' he said, coming forward.  \'I be wherrited out of my life,\r\nand I have thought of you again--you yourself, dear Anne, and not the\r\nmiller.  If you will only take this and lock it up for a few days till I\r\ncan find another good place for it--if you only would!\'  And he\r\nbreathlessly deposited the tin box on the table.\r\n\r\n\'What, obliged to dig it up from the cellar?\'\r\n\r\n\'Ay; my nephew hath a scent of the place--how, I don\'t know! but he and a\r\nyoung woman he\'s met with are searching everywhere.  I worked like a wire-\r\ndrawer to get it up and away while they were scraping in the next cellar.\r\nNow where could ye put it, dear?  \'Tis only a few documents, and my will,\r\nand such like, you know.  Poor soul o\' me, I\'m worn out with running and\r\nfright!\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll put it here till I can think of a better place,\' said Anne, lifting\r\nthe box.  \'Dear me, how heavy it is!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes,\' said Uncle Benjy hastily; \'the box is iron, you see.  However,\r\ntake care of it, because I am going to make it worth your while.  Ah, you\r\nare a good girl, Anne.  I wish you was mine!\'\r\n\r\nAnne looked at Uncle Benjy.  She had known for some time that she\r\npossessed all the affection he had to bestow.\r\n\r\n\'Why do you wish that?\' she said simply.\r\n\r\n\'Now don\'t ye argue with me.  Where d\'ye put the coffer?\'\r\n\r\n\'Here,\' said Anne, going to the window-seat, which rose as a flap,\r\ndisclosing a boxed receptacle beneath, as in many old houses.\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis very well for the present,\' he said dubiously, and they dropped the\r\ncoffer in, Anne locking down the seat, and giving him the key.  \'Now I\r\ndon\'t want ye to be on my side for nothing,\' he went on.  \'I never did\r\nnow, did I?  This is for you.\'  He handed her a little packet of paper,\r\nwhich Anne turned over and looked at curiously.  \'I always meant to do\r\nit,\' continued Uncle Benjy, gazing at the packet as it lay in her hand,\r\nand sighing.  \'Come, open it, my dear; I always meant to do it!\'\r\n\r\nShe opened it and found twenty new guineas snugly packed within.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, they are for you.  I always meant to do it!\' he said, sighing\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\'But you owe me nothing!\' returned Anne, holding them out.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t say it!\' cried Uncle Benjy, covering his eyes.  \'Put \'em away. . . .\r\nWell, if you _don\'t_ want \'em--But put \'em away, dear Anne; they are\r\nfor you, because you have kept my counsel.  Good-night t\'ye.  Yes, they\r\nare for you.\'\r\n\r\nHe went a few steps, and turning back added anxiously, \'You won\'t spend\r\n\'em in clothes, or waste \'em in fairings, or ornaments of any kind, my\r\ndear girl?\'\r\n\r\n\'I will not,\' said Anne.  \'I wish you would have them.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no,\' said Uncle Benjy, rushing off to escape their shine.  But he\r\nhad got no further than the passage when he returned again.\r\n\r\n\'And you won\'t lend \'em to anybody, or put \'em into the bank--for no bank\r\nis safe in these troublous times?. . .  If I was you I\'d keep them\r\n_exactly_ as they be, and not spend \'em on any account.  Shall I lock\r\nthem into my box for ye?\'\r\n\r\n\'Certainly,\' said she; and the farmer rapidly unlocked the window-bench,\r\nopened the box, and locked them in.\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis much the best plan,\' he said with great satisfaction as he returned\r\nthe keys to his pocket.  \'There they will always be safe, you see, and\r\nyou won\'t be exposed to temptation.\'\r\n\r\nWhen the old man had been gone a few minutes, the miller and his wife\r\ncame in, quite unconscious of all that had passed.  Anne\'s anxiety about\r\nBob was again uppermost now, and she spoke but meagrely of old Derriman\'s\r\nvisit, and nothing of what he had left.  She would fain have asked them\r\nif they knew where Bob was, but that she did not wish to inform them of\r\nthe rupture.  She was forced to admit to herself that she had somewhat\r\ntried his patience, and that impulsive men had been known to do dark\r\nthings with themselves at such times.\r\n\r\nThey sat down to supper, the clock ticked rapidly on, and at length the\r\nmiller said, \'Bob is later than usual.  Where can he be?\'\r\n\r\nAs they both looked at her, she could no longer keep the secret.\r\n\r\n\'It is my fault,\' she cried; \'I have driven him away!  What shall I do?\'\r\n\r\nThe nature of the quarrel was at once guessed, and her two elders said no\r\nmore.  Anne rose and went to the front door, where she listened for every\r\nsound with a palpitating heart.  Then she went in; then she went out: and\r\non one occasion she heard the miller say, \'I wonder what hath passed\r\nbetween Bob and Anne.  I hope the chap will come home.\'\r\n\r\nJust about this time light footsteps were heard without, and Bob bounced\r\ninto the passage.  Anne, who stood back in the dark while he passed,\r\nfollowed him into the room, where her mother and the miller were on the\r\npoint of retiring to bed, candle in hand.\r\n\r\n\'I have kept ye up, I fear,\' began Bob cheerily, and apparently without\r\nthe faintest recollection of his tragic exit from the house.  \'But the\r\ntruth on\'t is, I met with Fess Derriman at the "Duke of York" as I went\r\nfrom here, and there we have been playing Put ever since, not noticing\r\nhow the time was going.  I haven\'t had a good chat with the fellow for\r\nyears and years, and really he is an out and out good comrade--a regular\r\nhearty!  Poor fellow, he\'s been very badly used.  I never heard the\r\nrights of the story till now; but it seems that old uncle of his treats\r\nhim shamefully.  He has been hiding away his money, so that poor Fess\r\nmight not have a farthing, till at last the young man has turned, like\r\nany other worm, and is now determined to ferret out what he has done with\r\nit.  The poor young chap hadn\'t a farthing of ready money till I lent him\r\na couple of guineas--a thing I never did more willingly in my life.  But\r\nthe man was very honourable.  "No; no," says he, "don\'t let me deprive\r\nye."  He\'s going to marry, and what may you think he is going to do it\r\nfor?\'\r\n\r\n\'For love, I hope,\' said Anne\'s mother.\r\n\r\n\'For money, I suppose, since he\'s so short,\' said the miller.\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said Bob, \'for _spite_.  He has been badly served--deuced badly\r\nserved--by a woman.  I never heard of a more heartless case in my life.\r\nThe poor chap wouldn\'t mention names, but it seems this young woman has\r\ntrifled with him in all manner of cruel ways--pushed him into the river,\r\ntried to steal his horse when he was called out to defend his country--in\r\nshort, served him rascally.  So I gave him the two guineas and said, "Now\r\nlet\'s drink to the hussy\'s downfall!"\'\r\n\r\n\'O!\' said Anne, having approached behind him.\r\n\r\nBob turned and saw her, and at the same moment Mr. and Mrs. Loveday\r\ndiscreetly retired by the other door.\r\n\r\n\'Is it peace?\' he asked tenderly.\r\n\r\n\'O yes,\' she anxiously replied.  \'I--didn\'t mean to make you think I had\r\nno heart.\'  At this Bob inclined his countenance towards hers.  \'No,\' she\r\nsaid, smiling through two incipient tears as she drew back.  \'You are to\r\nshow good behaviour for six months, and you must promise not to frighten\r\nme again by running off when I--show you how badly you have served me.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am yours obedient--in anything,\' cried Bob.  \'But am I pardoned?\'\r\n\r\nYouth is foolish; and does a woman often let her reasoning in favour of\r\nthe worthier stand in the way of her perverse desire for the less worthy\r\nat such times as these?  She murmured some soft words, ending with \'Do\r\nyou repent?\'\r\n\r\nIt would be superfluous to transcribe Bob\'s answer.\r\n\r\nFootsteps were heard without.\r\n\r\n\'O begad; I forgot!\' said Bob.  \'He\'s waiting out there for a light.\'\r\n\r\n\'Who?\'\r\n\r\n\'My friend Derriman.\'\r\n\r\n\'But, Bob, I have to explain.\'\r\n\r\nBut Festus had by this time entered the lobby, and Anne, with a hasty\r\n\'Get rid of him at once!\' vanished upstairs.\r\n\r\nHere she waited and waited, but Festus did not seem inclined to depart;\r\nand at last, foreboding some collision of interests from Bob\'s new\r\nfriendship for this man, she crept into a storeroom which was over the\r\napartment into which Loveday and Festus had gone.  By looking through a\r\nknot-hole in the floor it was easy to command a view of the room beneath,\r\nthis being unceiled, with moulded beams and rafters.\r\n\r\nFestus had sat down on the hollow window-bench, and was continuing the\r\nstatement of his wrongs.  \'If he only knew what he was sitting upon,\' she\r\nthought apprehensively, \'how easily he could tear up the flap, lock and\r\nall, with his strong arm, and seize upon poor Uncle Benjy\'s possessions!\'\r\nBut he did not appear to know, unless he were acting, which was just\r\npossible.  After a while he rose, and going to the table lifted the\r\ncandle to light his pipe.  At the moment when the flame began diving into\r\nthe bowl the door noiselessly opened and a figure slipped across the room\r\nto the window-bench, hastily unlocked it, withdrew the box, and beat a\r\nretreat.  Anne in a moment recognized the ghostly intruder as Festus\r\nDerriman\'s uncle.  Before he could get out of the room Festus set down\r\nthe candle and turned.\r\n\r\n\'What--Uncle Benjy--haw, haw!  Here at this time of night?\'\r\n\r\nUncle Benjy\'s eyes grew paralyzed, and his mouth opened and shut like a\r\nfrog\'s in a drought, the action producing no sound.\r\n\r\n\'What have we got here--a tin box--the box of boxes?  Why, I\'ll carry it\r\nfor \'ee, uncle!--I am going home.\'\r\n\r\n\'N-no-no, thanky, Festus: it is n-n-not heavy at all, thanky,\' gasped the\r\nsquireen.\r\n\r\n\'O but I must,\' said Festus, pulling at the box.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t let him have it, Bob!\' screamed the excited Anne through the hole\r\nin the floor.\r\n\r\n\'No, don\'t let him!\' cried the uncle.  \'\'Tis a plot--there\'s a woman at\r\nthe window waiting to help him!\'\r\n\r\nAnne\'s eyes flew to the window, and she saw Matilda\'s face pressed\r\nagainst the pane.\r\n\r\nBob, though he did not know whence Anne\'s command proceeded obeyed with\r\nalacrity, pulled the box from the two relatives, and placed it on the\r\ntable beside him.\r\n\r\n\'Now, look here, hearties; what\'s the meaning o\' this?\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s trying to rob me of all I possess!\' cried the old man.  \'My heart-\r\nstrings seem as if they were going crack, crack, crack!\'\r\n\r\nAt this instant the miller in his shirt-sleeves entered the room, having\r\ngot thus far in his undressing when he heard the noise.  Bob and Festus\r\nturned to him to explain; and when the latter had had his say Bob added,\r\n\'Well, all I know is that this box\'--here he stretched out his hand to\r\nlay it upon the lid for emphasis.  But as nothing but thin air met his\r\nfingers where the box had been, he turned, and found that the box was\r\ngone, Uncle Benjy having vanished also.\r\n\r\nFestus, with an imprecation, hastened to the door, but though the night\r\nwas not dark Farmer Derriman and his burden were nowhere to be seen.  On\r\nthe bridge Festus joined a shadowy female form, and they went along the\r\nroad together, followed for some distance by Bob, lest they should meet\r\nwith and harm the old man.  But the precaution was unnecessary: nowhere\r\non the road was there any sign of Farmer Derriman, or of the box that\r\nbelonged to him.  When Bob re-entered the house Anne and Mrs. Loveday had\r\njoined the miller downstairs, and then for the first time he learnt who\r\nhad been the heroine of Festus\'s lamentable story, with many other\r\nparticulars of that yeoman\'s history which he had never before known.  Bob\r\nswore that he would not speak to the traitor again, and the family\r\nretired.\r\n\r\nThe escape of old Mr. Derriman from the annoyances of his nephew not only\r\nheld good for that night, but for next day, and for ever.  Just after\r\ndawn on the following morning a labouring man, who was going to his work,\r\nsaw the old farmer and landowner leaning over a rail in a mead near his\r\nhouse, apparently engaged in contemplating the water of a brook before\r\nhim.  Drawing near, the man spoke, but Uncle Benjy did not reply.  His\r\nhead was hanging strangely, his body being supported in its erect\r\nposition entirely by the rail that passed under each arm.  On\r\nafter-examination it was found that Uncle Benjy\'s poor withered heart had\r\ncracked and stopped its beating from damages inflicted on it by the\r\nexcitements of his life, and of the previous night in particular.  The\r\nunconscious carcass was little more than a light empty husk, dry and\r\nfleshless as that of a dead heron found on a moor in January.\r\n\r\nBut the tin box was not discovered with or near him.  It was searched for\r\nall the week, and all the month.  The mill-pond was dragged, quarries\r\nwere examined, woods were threaded, rewards were offered; but in vain.\r\n\r\nAt length one day in the spring, when the mill-house was about to be\r\ncleaned throughout, the chimney-board of Anne\'s bedroom, concealing a\r\nyawning fire-place, had to be taken down.  In the chasm behind it stood\r\nthe missing deed-box of Farmer Derriman.\r\n\r\nMany were the conjectures as to how it had got there. Then Anne\r\nremembered that on going to bed on the night of the collision between\r\nFestus and his uncle in the room below, she had seen mud on the carpet of\r\nher room, and the miller remembered that he had seen footprints on the\r\nback staircase.  The solution of the mystery seemed to be that the late\r\nUncle Benjy, instead of running off from the house with his box, had\r\ndoubled on getting out of the front door, entered at the back, deposited\r\nhis box in Anne\'s chamber where it was found, and then leisurely pursued\r\nhis way home at the heels of Festus, intending to tell Anne of his trick\r\nthe next day--an intention that was for ever frustrated by the stroke of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nMr. Derriman\'s solicitor was a Casterbridge man, and Anne placed the box\r\nin his hands.  Uncle Benjy\'s will was discovered within; and by this\r\ntestament Anne\'s queer old friend appointed her sole executrix of his\r\nsaid will, and, more than that, gave and bequeathed to the same young\r\nlady all his real and personal estate, with the solitary exception of\r\nfive small freehold houses in a back street in Budmouth, which were\r\ndevised to his nephew Festus, as a sufficient property to maintain him\r\ndecently, without affording any margin for extravagances.  Oxwell Hall,\r\nwith its muddy quadrangle, archways, mullioned windows, cracked\r\nbattlements, and weed-grown garden, passed with the rest into the hands\r\nof Anne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI.  JOHN MARCHES INTO THE NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring this exciting time John Loveday seldom or never appeared at the\r\nmill.  With the recall of Bob, in which he had been sole agent, his\r\nmission seemed to be complete.\r\n\r\nOne mid-day, before Anne had made any change in her manner of living on\r\naccount of her unexpected acquisition, Lieutenant Bob came in rather\r\nsuddenly.  He had been to Budmouth, and announced to the arrested senses\r\nof the family that the --th Dragoons were ordered to join Sir Arthur\r\nWellesley in the Peninsula.\r\n\r\nThese tidings produced a great impression on the household.  John had\r\nbeen so long in the neighbourhood, either at camp or in barracks, that\r\nthey had almost forgotten the possibility of his being sent away; and\r\nthey now began to reflect upon the singular infrequency of his calls\r\nsince his brother\'s return.  There was not much time, however, for\r\nreflection, if they wished to make the most of John\'s farewell visit,\r\nwhich was to be paid the same evening, the departure of the regiment\r\nbeing fixed for next day.  A hurried valedictory supper was prepared\r\nduring the afternoon, and shortly afterwards John arrived.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be more thoughtful and a trifle paler than of old, but\r\nbeyond these traces, which might have been due to the natural wear and\r\ntear of time, he showed no signs of gloom.  On his way through the town\r\nthat morning a curious little incident had occurred to him.  He was\r\nwalking past one of the churches when a wedding-party came forth, the\r\nbride and bridegroom being Matilda and Festus Derriman.  At sight of the\r\ntrumpet-major the yeoman had glared triumphantly; Matilda, on her part,\r\nhad winked at him slily, as much as to say--.  But what she meant heaven\r\nknows: the trumpet-major did not trouble himself to think, and passed on\r\nwithout returning the mark of confidence with which she had favoured him.\r\n\r\nSoon after John\'s arrival at the mill several of his friends dropped in\r\nfor the same purpose of bidding adieu.  They were mostly the men who had\r\nbeen entertained there on the occasion of the regiment\'s advent on the\r\ndown, when Anne and her mother were coaxed in to grace the party by their\r\nsuperior presence; and their well-trained, gallant manners were such as\r\nto make them interesting visitors now as at all times.  For it was a\r\nperiod when romance had not so greatly faded out of military life as it\r\nhas done in these days of short service, heterogeneous mixing, and\r\ntransient campaigns; when the esprit de corps was strong, and long\r\nexperience stamped noteworthy professional characteristics even on rank\r\nand file; while the miller\'s visitors had the additional advantage of\r\nbeing picked men.\r\n\r\nThey could not stay so long to-night as on that earlier and more cheerful\r\noccasion, and the final adieus were spoken at an early hour.  It was no\r\nmere playing at departure, as when they had gone to Exonbury barracks,\r\nand there was a warm and prolonged shaking of hands all round.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll wish the poor fellows good-bye?\' said Bob to Anne, who had not\r\ncome forward for that purpose like the rest.  \'They are going away, and\r\nwould like to have your good word.\'\r\n\r\nShe then shyly advanced, and every man felt that he must make some pretty\r\nspeech as he shook her by the hand.\r\n\r\n\'Good-bye!  May you remember us as long as it makes ye happy, and forget\r\nus as soon as it makes ye sad,\' said Sergeant Brett.\r\n\r\n\'Good-night!  Health, wealth, and long life to ye!\' said Sergeant-major\r\nWills, taking her hand from Brett.\r\n\r\n\'I trust to meet ye again as the wife of a worthy man,\' said Trumpeter\r\nBuck.\r\n\r\n\'We\'ll drink your health throughout the campaign, and so good-bye t\'ye,\'\r\nsaid Saddler-sergeant Jones, raising her hand to his lips.\r\n\r\nThree others followed with similar remarks, to each of which Anne\r\nblushingly replied as well as she could, wishing them a prosperous\r\nvoyage, easy conquest, and a speedy return.\r\n\r\nBut, alas, for that!  Battles and skirmishes, advances and retreats,\r\nfevers and fatigues, told hard on Anne\'s gallant friends in the coming\r\ntime.  Of the seven upon whom these wishes were bestowed, five, including\r\nthe trumpet-major, were dead men within the few following years, and\r\ntheir bones left to moulder in the land of their campaigns.\r\n\r\nJohn lingered behind.  When the others were outside, expressing a final\r\nfarewell to his father, Bob, and Mrs. Loveday, he came to Anne, who\r\nremained within.\r\n\r\n\'But I thought you were going to look in again before leaving?\' she said\r\ngently.\r\n\r\n\'No; I find I cannot.  Good-bye!\'\r\n\r\n\'John,\' said Anne, holding his right hand in both hers, \'I must tell you\r\nsomething.  You were wise in not taking me at my word that day.  I was\r\ngreatly mistaken about myself.  Gratitude is not love, though I wanted to\r\nmake it so for the time.  You don\'t call me thoughtless for what I did?\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear Anne,\' cried John, with more gaiety than truthfulness, \'don\'t\r\nlet yourself be troubled!  What happens is for the best.  Soldiers love\r\nhere to-day and there to-morrow.  Who knows that you won\'t hear of my\r\nattentions to some Spanish maid before a month is gone by?  \'Tis the way\r\nof us, you know; a soldier\'s heart is not worth a week\'s purchase--ha,\r\nha!  Goodbye, good-bye!\'\r\n\r\nAnne felt the expediency of his manner, received the affectation as real,\r\nand smiled her reply, not knowing that the adieu was for evermore.  Then\r\nwith a tear in his eye he went out of the door, where he bade farewell to\r\nthe miller, Mrs. Loveday, and Bob, who said at parting, \'It\'s all right,\r\nJack, my dear fellow.  After a coaxing that would have been enough to win\r\nthree ordinary Englishwomen, five French, and ten Mulotters, she has to-\r\nday agreed to bestow her hand upon me at the end of six months.  Good-bye,\r\nJack, good-bye!\'\r\n\r\nThe candle held by his father shed its waving light upon John\'s face and\r\nuniform as with a farewell smile he turned on the doorstone, backed by\r\nthe black night; and in another moment he had plunged into the darkness,\r\nthe ring of his smart step dying away upon the bridge as he joined his\r\ncompanions-in-arms, and went off to blow his trumpet till silenced for\r\never upon one of the bloody battle-fields of Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n{207}  _Vide_ Preface.\r\n\r\n{211}  _Vide_ Preface.\r\n\r\n{225}  _Vide_ Preface.\r\n\r\n{272}  _Vide_ Preface.\r\n\r\n{303}  _Vide_ Preface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TRUMPET-MAJOR***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 2864.txt or 2864.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/8/6/2864\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
