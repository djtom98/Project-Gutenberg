Austria was far away from the world, and asleep;\r\nit was still the Middle Ages in Austria, and promised to remain so\r\nforever. Some even set it away back centuries upon centuries and said\r\nthat by the mental and spiritual clock it was still the Age of Belief\r\nin Austria. But they meant it as a compliment, not a slur, and it was so\r\ntaken, and we were all proud of it. I remember it well, although I was\r\nonly a boy; and I remember, too, the pleasure it gave me.\r\n\r\nYes, Austria was far from the world, and asleep, and our village was in\r\nthe middle of that sleep, being in the middle of Austria. It drowsed in\r\npeace in the deep privacy of a hilly and woodsy solitude where news from\r\nthe world hardly ever came to disturb its dreams, and was infinitely\r\ncontent. At its front flowed the tranquil river, its surface painted\r\nwith cloud-forms and the reflections of drifting arks and stone-boats;\r\nbehind it rose the woody steeps to the base of the lofty precipice;\r\nfrom the top of the precipice frowned a vast castle, its long stretch of\r\ntowers and bastions mailed in vines; beyond the river, a league to the\r\nleft, was a tumbled expanse of forest-clothed hills cloven by winding\r\ngorges where the sun never penetrated; and to the right a precipice\r\noverlooked the river, and between it and the hills just spoken of lay a\r\nfar-reaching plain dotted with little homesteads nested among orchards\r\nand shade trees.\r\n\r\nThe whole region for leagues around was the hereditary property of a\r\nprince, whose servants kept the castle always in perfect condition for\r\noccupancy, but neither he nor his family came there oftener than once\r\nin five years. When they came it was as if the lord of the world had\r\narrived, and had brought all the glories of its kingdoms along; and when\r\nthey went they left a calm behind which was like the deep sleep which\r\nfollows an orgy.\r\n\r\nEseldorf was a paradise for us boys. We were not overmuch pestered with\r\nschooling. Mainly we were trained to be good Christians; to revere\r\nthe Virgin, the Church, and the saints above everything. Beyond these\r\nmatters we were not required to know much; and, in fact, not allowed\r\nto. Knowledge was not good for the common people, and could make them\r\ndiscontented with the lot which God had appointed for them, and God\r\nwould not endure discontentment with His plans. We had two priests. One\r\nof them, Father Adolf, was a very zealous and strenuous priest, much\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nThere may have been better priests, in some ways, than Father Adolf, but\r\nthere was never one in our commune who was held in more solemn and awful\r\nrespect. This was because he had absolutely no fear of the Devil. He was\r\nthe only Christian I have ever known of whom that could be truly said.\r\nPeople stood in deep dread of him on that account; for they thought that\r\nthere must be something supernatural about him, else he could not be so\r\nbold and so confident. All men speak in bitter disapproval of the Devil,\r\nbut they do it reverently, not flippantly; but Father Adolf\'s way was\r\nvery different; he called him by every name he could lay his tongue to,\r\nand it made everyone shudder that heard him; and often he would\r\neven speak of him scornfully and scoffingly; then the people crossed\r\nthemselves and went quickly out of his presence, fearing that something\r\nfearful might happen.\r\n\r\nFather Adolf had actually met Satan face to face more than once, and\r\ndefied him. This was known to be so. Father Adolf said it himself. He\r\nnever made any secret of it, but spoke it right out. And that he was\r\nspeaking true there was proof in at least one instance, for on that\r\noccasion he quarreled with the enemy, and intrepidly threw his bottle at\r\nhim; and there, upon the wall of his study, was the ruddy splotch where\r\nit struck and broke.\r\n\r\nBut it was Father Peter, the other priest, that we all loved best and\r\nwere sorriest for. Some people charged him with talking around in\r\nconversation that God was all goodness and would find a way to save all\r\nhis poor human children. It was a horrible thing to say, but there was\r\nnever any absolute proof that Father Peter said it; and it was out of\r\ncharacter for him to say it, too, for he was always good and gentle and\r\ntruthful. He wasn\'t charged with saying it in the pulpit, where all the\r\ncongregation could hear and testify, but only outside, in talk; and it\r\nis easy for enemies to manufacture that. Father Peter had an enemy and a\r\nvery powerful one, the astrologer who lived in a tumbled old tower up\r\nthe valley, and put in his nights studying the stars. Every one knew he\r\ncould foretell wars and famines, though that was not so hard, for there\r\nwas always a war, and generally a famine somewhere. But he could also\r\nread any man\'s life through the stars in a big book he had, and find\r\nlost property, and every one in the village except Father Peter stood in\r\nawe of him. Even Father Adolf, who had defied the Devil, had a wholesome\r\nrespect for the astrologer when he came through our village wearing his\r\ntall, pointed hat and his long, flowing robe with stars on it, carrying\r\nhis big book, and a staff which was known to have magic power. The\r\nbishop himself sometimes listened to the astrologer, it was said, for,\r\nbesides studying the stars and prophesying, the astrologer made a great\r\nshow of piety, which would impress the bishop, of course.\r\n\r\nBut Father Peter took no stock in the astrologer. He denounced him\r\nopenly as a charlatan--a fraud with no valuable knowledge of any kind,\r\nor powers beyond those of an ordinary and rather inferior human being,\r\nwhich naturally made the astrologer hate Father Peter and wish to ruin\r\nhim. It was the astrologer, as we all believed, who originated the story\r\nabout Father Peter\'s shocking remark and carried it to the bishop. It\r\nwas said that Father Peter had made the remark to his niece, Marget,\r\nthough Marget denied it and implored the bishop to believe her and spare\r\nher old uncle from poverty and disgrace. But the bishop wouldn\'t listen.\r\nHe suspended Father Peter indefinitely, though he wouldn\'t go so far as\r\nto excommunicate him on the evidence of only one witness; and now Father\r\nPeter had been out a couple of years, and our other priest, Father\r\nAdolf, had his flock.\r\n\r\nThose had been hard years for the old priest and Marget. They had been\r\nfavorites, but of course that changed when they came under the shadow\r\nof the bishop\'s frown. Many of their friends fell away entirely, and the\r\nrest became cool and distant. Marget was a lovely girl of eighteen when\r\nthe trouble came, and she had the best head in the village, and the most\r\nin it. She taught the harp, and earned all her clothes and pocket money\r\nby her own industry. But her scholars fell off one by one now; she was\r\nforgotten when there were dances and parties among the youth of the\r\nvillage; the young fellows stopped coming to the house, all except\r\nWilhelm Meidling--and he could have been spared; she and her uncle were\r\nsad and forlorn in their neglect and disgrace, and the sunshine was gone\r\nout of their lives. Matters went worse and worse, all through the two\r\nyears. Clothes were wearing out, bread was harder and harder to get.\r\nAnd now, at last, the very end was come. Solomon Isaacs had lent all the\r\nmoney he was willing to put on the house, and gave notice that to-morrow\r\nhe would foreclose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\nThree of us boys were always together, and had been so from the cradle,\r\nbeing fond of one another from the beginning, and this affection\r\ndeepened as the years went on--Nikolaus Bauman, son of the principal\r\njudge of the local court; Seppi Wohlmeyer, son of the keeper of the\r\nprincipal inn, the \xe2\x80\x9cGolden Stag,\xe2\x80\x9d which had a nice garden, with shade\r\ntrees reaching down to the riverside, and pleasure boats for hire; and I\r\nwas the third--Theodor Fischer, son of the church organist, who was\r\nalso leader of the village musicians, teacher of the violin, composer,\r\ntax-collector of the commune, sexton, and in other ways a useful\r\ncitizen, and respected by all. We knew the hills and the woods as well\r\nas the birds knew them; for we were always roaming them when we had\r\nleisure--at least, when we were not swimming or boating or fishing, or\r\nplaying on the ice or sliding down hill.\r\n\r\nAnd we had the run of the castle park, and very few had that. It was\r\nbecause we were pets of the oldest servingman in the castle--Felix\r\nBrandt; and often we went there, nights, to hear him talk about old\r\ntimes and strange things, and to smoke with him (he taught us that) and\r\nto drink coffee; for he had served in the wars, and was at the siege of\r\nVienna; and there, when the Turks were defeated and driven away, among\r\nthe captured things were bags of coffee, and the Turkish prisoners\r\nexplained the character of it and how to make a pleasant drink out of\r\nit, and now he always kept coffee by him, to drink himself and also to\r\nastonish the ignorant with. When it stormed he kept us all night; and\r\nwhile it thundered and lightened outside he told us about ghosts and\r\nhorrors of every kind, and of battles and murders and mutilations, and\r\nsuch things, and made it pleasant and cozy inside; and he told these\r\nthings from his own experience largely. He had seen many ghosts in his\r\ntime, and witches and enchanters, and once he was lost in a fierce storm\r\nat midnight in the mountains, and by the glare of the lightning had seen\r\nthe Wild Huntsman rage on the blast with his specter dogs chasing after\r\nhim through the driving cloud-rack. Also he had seen an incubus once,\r\nand several times he had seen the great bat that sucks the blood from\r\nthe necks of people while they are asleep, fanning them softly with its\r\nwings and so keeping them drowsy till they die.\r\n\r\nHe encouraged us not to fear supernatural things, such as ghosts, and\r\nsaid they did no harm, but only wandered about because they were lonely\r\nand distressed and wanted kindly notice and compassion; and in time we\r\nlearned not to be afraid, and even went down with him in the night to\r\nthe haunted chamber in the dungeons of the castle. The ghost appeared\r\nonly once, and it went by very dim to the sight and floated noiseless\r\nthrough the air, and then disappeared; and we scarcely trembled, he had\r\ntaught us so well. He said it came up sometimes in the night and woke\r\nhim by passing its clammy hand over his face, but it did him no hurt; it\r\nonly wanted sympathy and notice. But the strangest thing was that he had\r\nseen angels--actual angels out of heaven--and had talked with them. They\r\nhad no wings, and wore clothes, and talked and looked and acted just\r\nlike any natural person, and you would never know them for angels except\r\nfor the wonderful things they did which a mortal could not do, and the\r\nway they suddenly disappeared while you were talking with them, which\r\nwas also a thing which no mortal could do. And he said they were\r\npleasant and cheerful, not gloomy and melancholy, like ghosts.\r\n\r\nIt was after that kind of a talk one May night that we got up next\r\nmorning and had a good breakfast with him and then went down and crossed\r\nthe bridge and went away up into the hills on the left to a woody\r\nhill-top which was a favorite place of ours, and there we stretched out\r\non the grass in the shade to rest and smoke and talk over these strange\r\nthings, for they were in our minds yet, and impressing us. But we\r\ncouldn\'t smoke, because we had been heedless and left our flint and\r\nsteel behind.\r\n\r\nSoon there came a youth strolling toward us through the trees, and he\r\nsat down and began to talk in a friendly way, just as if he knew us.\r\nBut we did not answer him, for he was a stranger and we were not used to\r\nstrangers and were shy of them. He had new and good clothes on, and was\r\nhandsome and had a winning face and a pleasant voice, and was easy and\r\ngraceful and unembarrassed, not slouchy and awkward and diffident, like\r\nother boys. We wanted to be friendly with him, but didn\'t know how to\r\nbegin. Then I thought of the pipe, and wondered if it would be taken\r\nas kindly meant if I offered it to him. But I remembered that we had\r\nno fire, so I was sorry and disappointed. But he looked up bright and\r\npleased, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFire? Oh, that is easy; I will furnish it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was so astonished I couldn\'t speak; for I had not said anything. He\r\ntook the pipe and blew his breath on it, and the tobacco glowed red, and\r\nspirals of blue smoke rose up. We jumped up and were going to run, for\r\nthat was natural; and we did run a few steps, although he was yearningly\r\npleading for us to stay, and giving us his word that he would not do us\r\nany harm, but only wanted to be friends with us and have company. So we\r\nstopped and stood, and wanted to go back, being full of curiosity\r\nand wonder, but afraid to venture. He went on coaxing, in his soft,\r\npersuasive way; and when we saw that the pipe did not blow up and\r\nnothing happened, our confidence returned by little and little, and\r\npresently our curiosity got to be stronger than our fear, and we\r\nventured back--but slowly, and ready to fly at any alarm.\r\n\r\nHe was bent on putting us at ease, and he had the right art; one could\r\nnot remain doubtful and timorous where a person was so earnest and\r\nsimple and gentle, and talked so alluringly as he did; no, he won us\r\nover, and it was not long before we were content and comfortable and\r\nchatty, and glad we had found this new friend. When the feeling of\r\nconstraint was all gone we asked him how he had learned to do that\r\nstrange thing, and he said he hadn\'t learned it at all; it came natural\r\nto him--like other things--other curious things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat ones?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, a number; I don\'t know how many.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you let us see you do them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo--please!\xe2\x80\x9d the others said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\'t run away again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--indeed we won\'t. Please do. Won\'t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, with pleasure; but you mustn\'t forget your promise, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe said we wouldn\'t, and he went to a puddle and came back with water\r\nin a cup which he had made out of a leaf, and blew upon it and threw it\r\nout, and it was a lump of ice the shape of the cup. We were astonished\r\nand charmed, but not afraid any more; we were very glad to be there, and\r\nasked him to go on and do some more things. And he did. He said he would\r\ngive us any kind of fruit we liked, whether it was in season or not. We\r\nall spoke at once;\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOrange!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApple!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrapes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are in your pockets,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and it was true. And they were of\r\nthe best, too, and we ate them and wished we had more, though none of us\r\nsaid so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will find them where those came from,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand everything\r\nelse your appetites call for; and you need not name the thing you wish;\r\nas long as I am with you, you have only to wish and find.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he said true. There was never anything so wonderful and so\r\ninteresting. Bread, cakes, sweets, nuts--whatever one wanted, it was\r\nthere. He ate nothing himself, but sat and chatted, and did one curious\r\nthing after another to amuse us. He made a tiny toy squirrel out of\r\nclay, and it ran up a tree and sat on a limb overhead and barked down\r\nat us. Then he made a dog that was not much larger than a mouse, and it\r\ntreed the squirrel and danced about the tree, excited and barking, and\r\nwas as alive as any dog could be. It frightened the squirrel from tree\r\nto tree and followed it up until both were out of sight in the forest.\r\nHe made birds out of clay and set them free, and they flew away,\r\nsinging.\r\n\r\nAt last I made bold to ask him to tell us who he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn angel,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, quite simply, and set another bird free and clapped\r\nhis hands and made it fly away.\r\n\r\nA kind of awe fell upon us when we heard him say that, and we were\r\nafraid again; but he said we need not be troubled, there was no occasion\r\nfor us to be afraid of an angel, and he liked us, anyway. He went on\r\nchatting as simply and unaffectedly as ever; and while he talked he made\r\na crowd of little men and women the size of your finger, and they went\r\ndiligently to work and cleared and leveled off a space a couple of yards\r\nsquare in the grass and began to build a cunning little castle in it,\r\nthe women mixing the mortar and carrying it up the scaffoldings in pails\r\non their heads, just as our work-women have always done, and the men\r\nlaying the courses of masonry--five hundred of these toy people swarming\r\nbriskly about and working diligently and wiping the sweat off their\r\nfaces as natural as life. In the absorbing interest of watching those\r\nfive hundred little people make the castle grow step by step and course\r\nby course, and take shape and symmetry, that feeling and awe soon passed\r\naway and we were quite comfortable and at home again. We asked if we\r\nmight make some people, and he said yes, and told Seppi to make some\r\ncannon for the walls, and told Nikolaus to make some halberdiers, with\r\nbreastplates and greaves and helmets, and I was to make some cavalry,\r\nwith horses, and in allotting these tasks he called us by our names,\r\nbut did not say how he knew them. Then Seppi asked him what his own name\r\nwas, and he said, tranquilly, \xe2\x80\x9cSatan,\xe2\x80\x9d and held out a chip and caught a\r\nlittle woman on it who was falling from the scaffolding and put her back\r\nwhere she belonged, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cShe is an idiot to step backward like\r\nthat and not notice what she is about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt caught us suddenly, that name did, and our work dropped out of our\r\nhands and broke to pieces--a cannon, a halberdier, and a horse. Satan\r\nlaughed, and asked what was the matter. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cNothing, only it seemed\r\na strange name for an angel.\xe2\x80\x9d He asked why.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it\'s--it\'s--well, it\'s his name, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--he is my uncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said it placidly, but it took our breath for a moment and made our\r\nhearts beat. He did not seem to notice that, but mended our halberdiers\r\nand things with a touch, handing them to us finished, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\'t\r\nyou remember?--he was an angel himself, once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--it\'s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seppi; \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\'t think of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore the Fall he was blameless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nikolaus, \xe2\x80\x9che was without sin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a good family--ours,\xe2\x80\x9d said Satan; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is not a better. He is\r\nthe only member of it that has ever sinned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI should not be able to make any one understand how exciting it all was.\r\nYou know that kind of quiver that trembles around through you when you\r\nare seeing something so strange and enchanting and wonderful that it\r\nis just a fearful joy to be alive and look at it; and you know how\r\nyou gaze, and your lips turn dry and your breath comes short, but you\r\nwouldn\'t be anywhere but there, not for the world. I was bursting to\r\nask one question--I had it on my tongue\'s end and could hardly hold it\r\nback--but I was ashamed to ask it; it might be a rudeness. Satan set an\r\nox down that he had been making, and smiled up at me and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\'t be a rudeness, and I should forgive it if it was. Have I\r\nseen him? Millions of times. From the time that I was a little child a\r\nthousand years old I was his second favorite among the nursery angels of\r\nour blood and lineage--to use a human phrase--yes, from that time until\r\nthe Fall, eight thousand years, measured as you count time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight--thousand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to Seppi, and went on as if answering something that\r\nwas in Seppi\'s mind: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, naturally I look like a boy, for that is what\r\nI am. With us what you call time is a spacious thing; it takes a long\r\nstretch of it to grow an angel to full age.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a question in my\r\nmind, and he turned to me and answered it, \xe2\x80\x9cI am sixteen thousand years\r\nold--counting as you count.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he turned to Nikolaus and said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nthe Fall did not affect me nor the rest of the relationship. It was\r\nonly he that I was named for who ate of the fruit of the tree and then\r\nbeguiled the man and the woman with it. We others are still ignorant\r\nof sin; we are not able to commit it; we are without blemish, and\r\nshall abide in that estate always. We--\xe2\x80\x9d Two of the little workmen were\r\nquarreling, and in buzzing little bumblebee voices they were cursing\r\nand swearing at each other; now came blows and blood; then they locked\r\nthemselves together in a life-and-death struggle. Satan reached out his\r\nhand and crushed the life out of them with his fingers, threw them away,\r\nwiped the red from his fingers on his handkerchief, and went on\r\ntalking where he had left off: \xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot do wrong; neither have we any\r\ndisposition to do it, for we do not know what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed a strange speech, in the circumstances, but we barely noticed\r\nthat, we were so shocked and grieved at the wanton murder he had\r\ncommitted--for murder it was, that was its true name, and it was without\r\npalliation or excuse, for the men had not wronged him in any way. It\r\nmade us miserable, for we loved him, and had thought him so noble and so\r\nbeautiful and gracious, and had honestly believed he was an angel; and\r\nto have him do this cruel thing--ah, it lowered him so, and we had had\r\nsuch pride in him. He went right on talking, just as if nothing had\r\nhappened, telling about his travels, and the interesting things he had\r\nseen in the big worlds of our solar system and of other solar systems\r\nfar away in the remotenesses of space, and about the customs of the\r\nimmortals that inhabit them, somehow fascinating us, enchanting us,\r\ncharming us in spite of the pitiful scene that was now under our eyes,\r\nfor the wives of the little dead men had found the crushed and shapeless\r\nbodies and were crying over them, and sobbing and lamenting, and a\r\npriest was kneeling there with his hands crossed upon his breast,\r\npraying; and crowds and crowds of pitying friends were massed about\r\nthem, reverently uncovered, with their bare heads bowed, and many with\r\nthe tears running down--a scene which Satan paid no attention to until\r\nthe small noise of the weeping and praying began to annoy him, then he\r\nreached out and took the heavy board seat out of our swing and brought\r\nit down and mashed all those people into the earth just as if they had\r\nbeen flies, and went on talking just the same. An angel, and kill a\r\npriest! An angel who did not know how to do wrong, and yet destroys in\r\ncold blood hundreds of helpless poor men and women who had never done\r\nhim any harm! It made us sick to see that awful deed, and to think that\r\nnone of those poor creatures was prepared except the priest, for none of\r\nthem had ever heard a mass or seen a church. And we were witnesses; we\r\nhad seen these murders done and it was our duty to tell, and let the law\r\ntake its course.\r\n\r\nBut he went on talking right along, and worked his enchantments upon us\r\nagain with that fatal music of his voice. He made us forget everything;\r\nwe could only listen to him, and love him, and be his slaves, to do with\r\nus as he would. He made us drunk with the joy of being with him, and\r\nof looking into the heaven of his eyes, and of feeling the ecstasy that\r\nthrilled along our veins from the touch of his hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\nThe Stranger had seen everything, he had been everywhere, he knew\r\neverything, and he forgot nothing. What another must study, he learned\r\nat a glance; there were no difficulties for him. And he made things live\r\nbefore you when he told about them. He saw the world made; he saw Adam\r\ncreated; he saw Samson surge against the pillars and bring the temple\r\ndown in ruins about him; he saw Caesar\'s death; he told of the daily\r\nlife in heaven; he had seen the damned writhing in the red waves of\r\nhell; and he made us see all these things, and it was as if we were on\r\nthe spot and looking at them with our own eyes. And we felt them,\r\ntoo, but there was no sign that they were anything to him beyond mere\r\nentertainments. Those visions of hell, those poor babes and women and\r\ngirls and lads and men shrieking and supplicating in anguish--why, we\r\ncould hardly bear it, but he was as bland about it as if it had been so\r\nmany imitation rats in an artificial fire.\r\n\r\nAnd always when he was talking about men and women here on the earth\r\nand their doings--even their grandest and sublimest--we were secretly\r\nashamed, for his manner showed that to him they and their doings were\r\nof paltry poor consequence; often you would think he was talking about\r\nflies, if you didn\'t know. Once he even said, in so many words, that\r\nour people down here were quite interesting to him, notwithstanding they\r\nwere so dull and ignorant and trivial and conceited, and so diseased and\r\nrickety, and such a shabby, poor, worthless lot all around. He said it\r\nin a quite matter-of-course way and without bitterness, just as a person\r\nmight talk about bricks or manure or any other thing that was of no\r\nconsequence and hadn\'t feelings. I could see he meant no offense, but in\r\nmy thoughts I set it down as not very good manners.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cManners!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it is merely the truth, and truth is good\r\nmanners; manners are a fiction. The castle is done. Do you like it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAny one would have been obliged to like it. It was lovely to look at,\r\nit was so shapely and fine, and so cunningly perfect in all its\r\nparticulars, even to the little flags waving from the turrets. Satan\r\nsaid we must put the artillery in place now, and station the halberdiers\r\nand display the cavalry. Our men and horses were a spectacle to see,\r\nthey were so little like what they were intended for; for, of course, we\r\nhad no art in making such things. Satan said they were the worst he\r\nhad seen; and when he touched them and made them alive, it was just\r\nridiculous the way they acted, on account of their legs not being of\r\nuniform lengths. They reeled and sprawled around as if they were drunk,\r\nand endangered everybody\'s lives around them, and finally fell over and\r\nlay helpless and kicking. It made us all laugh, though it was a shameful\r\nthing to see. The guns were charged with dirt, to fire a salute, but\r\nthey were so crooked and so badly made that they all burst when they\r\nwent off, and killed some of the gunners and crippled the others. Satan\r\nsaid we would have a storm now, and an earthquake, if we liked, but\r\nwe must stand off a piece, out of danger. We wanted to call the people\r\naway, too, but he said never mind them; they were of no consequence, and\r\nwe could make more, some time or other, if we needed them.\r\n\r\nA small storm-cloud began to settle down black over the castle, and the\r\nminiature lightning and thunder began to play, and the ground to quiver,\r\nand the wind to pipe and wheeze, and the rain to fall, and all the\r\npeople flocked into the castle for shelter. The cloud settled down\r\nblacker and blacker, and one could see the castle only dimly through it;\r\nthe lightning blazed out flash upon flash and pierced the castle and set\r\nit on fire, and the flames shone out red and fierce through the cloud,\r\nand the people came flying out, shrieking, but Satan brushed them back,\r\npaying no attention to our begging and crying and imploring; and in\r\nthe midst of the howling of the wind and volleying of the thunder the\r\nmagazine blew up, the earthquake rent the ground wide, and the castle\'s\r\nwreck and ruin tumbled into the chasm, which swallowed it from sight,\r\nand closed upon it, with all that innocent life, not one of the five\r\nhundred poor creatures escaping. Our hearts were broken; we could not\r\nkeep from crying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\'t cry,\xe2\x80\x9d Satan said; \xe2\x80\x9cthey were of no value.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they are gone to hell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is no matter; we can make plenty more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was of no use to try to move him; evidently he was wholly without\r\nfeelings, and could not understand. He was full of bubbling spirits, and\r\nas gay as if this were a wedding instead of a fiendish massacre. And\r\nhe was bent on making us feel as he did, and of course his magic\r\naccomplished his desire. It was no trouble to him; he did whatever he\r\npleased with us. In a little while we were dancing on that grave, and\r\nhe was playing to us on a strange, sweet instrument which he took out\r\nof his pocket; and the music--but there is no music like that, unless\r\nperhaps in heaven, and that was where he brought it from, he said. It\r\nmade one mad, for pleasure; and we could not take our eyes from him, and\r\nthe looks that went out of our eyes came from our hearts, and their dumb\r\nspeech was worship. He brought the dance from heaven, too, and the bliss\r\nof paradise was in it.\r\n\r\nPresently he said he must go away on an errand. But we could not bear\r\nthe thought of it, and clung to him, and pleaded with him to stay; and\r\nthat pleased him, and he said so, and said he would not go yet, but\r\nwould wait a little while and we would sit down and talk a few minutes\r\nlonger; and he told us Satan was only his real name, and he was to be\r\nknown by it to us alone, but he had chosen another one to be called\r\nby in the presence of others; just a common one, such as people\r\nhave--Philip Traum.\r\n\r\nIt sounded so odd and mean for such a being! But it was his decision,\r\nand we said nothing; his decision was sufficient.\r\n\r\nWe had seen wonders this day; and my thoughts began to run on the\r\npleasure it would be to tell them when I got home, but he noticed those\r\nthoughts, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, all these matters are a secret among us four. I do not mind your\r\ntrying to tell them, if you like, but I will protect your tongues, and\r\nnothing of the secret will escape from them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a disappointment, but it couldn\'t be helped, and it cost us a\r\nsigh or two. We talked pleasantly along, and he was always reading our\r\nthoughts and responding to them, and it seemed to me that this was the\r\nmost wonderful of all the things he did, but he interrupted my musings\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it would be wonderful for you, but it is not wonderful for me. I\r\nam not limited like you. I am not subject to human conditions. I can\r\nmeasure and understand your human weaknesses, for I have studied them;\r\nbut I have none of them. My flesh is not real, although it would seem\r\nfirm to your touch; my clothes are not real; I am a spirit. Father Peter\r\nis coming.\xe2\x80\x9d We looked around, but did not see any one. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is not in\r\nsight yet, but you will see him presently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know him, Satan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\'t you talk with him when he comes? He is not ignorant and dull,\r\nlike us, and he would so like to talk with you. Will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother time, yes, but not now. I must go on my errand after a little.\r\nThere he is now; you can see him. Sit still, and don\'t say anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe looked up and saw Father Peter approaching through the chestnuts. We\r\nthree were sitting together in the grass, and Satan sat in front of\r\nus in the path. Father Peter came slowly along with his head down,\r\nthinking, and stopped within a couple of yards of us and took off his\r\nhat and got out his silk handkerchief, and stood there mopping his face\r\nand looking as if he were going to speak to us, but he didn\'t. Presently\r\nhe muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\'t think what brought me here; it seems as if I were\r\nin my study a minute ago--but I suppose I have been dreaming along for\r\nan hour and have come all this stretch without noticing; for I am not\r\nmyself in these troubled days.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he went mumbling along to himself\r\nand walked straight through Satan, just as if nothing were there. It\r\nmade us catch our breath to see it. We had the impulse to cry out, the\r\nway you nearly always do when a startling thing happens, but something\r\nmysteriously restrained us and we remained quiet, only breathing fast.\r\nThen the trees hid Father Peter after a little, and Satan said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is as I told you--I am only a spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, one perceives it now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nikolaus, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we are not spirits. It\r\nis plain he did not see you, but were we invisible, too? He looked at\r\nus, but he didn\'t seem to see us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, none of us was visible to him, for I wished it so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed almost too good to be true, that we were actually seeing these\r\nromantic and wonderful things, and that it was not a dream. And there he\r\nsat, looking just like anybody--so natural and simple and charming, and\r\nchatting along again the same as ever, and--well, words cannot make you\r\nunderstand what we felt. It was an ecstasy; and an ecstasy is a thing\r\nthat will not go into words; it feels like music, and one cannot tell\r\nabout music so that another person can get the feeling of it. He was\r\nback in the old ages once more now, and making them live before us. He\r\nhad seen so much, so much! It was just a wonder to look at him and try\r\nto think how it must seem to have such experience behind one.\r\n\r\nBut it made you seem sorrowfully trivial, and the creature of a day, and\r\nsuch a short and paltry day, too. And he didn\'t say anything to raise up\r\nyour drooping pride--no, not a word. He always spoke of men in the same\r\nold indifferent way--just as one speaks of bricks and manure-piles and\r\nsuch things; you could see that they were of no consequence to him, one\r\nway or the other. He didn\'t mean to hurt us, you could see that; just as\r\nwe don\'t mean to insult a brick when we disparage it; a brick\'s emotions\r\nare nothing to us; it never occurs to us to think whether it has any or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nOnce when he was bunching the most illustrious kings and conquerors\r\nand poets and prophets and pirates and beggars together--just a\r\nbrick-pile--I was shamed into putting in a word for man, and asked\r\nhim why he made so much difference between men and himself. He had to\r\nstruggle with that a moment; he didn\'t seem to understand how I could\r\nask such a strange question. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe difference between man and me? The difference between a mortal and\r\nan immortal? between a cloud and a spirit?\xe2\x80\x9d He picked up a wood-louse\r\nthat was creeping along a piece of bark: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the difference between\r\nCaesar and this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cOne cannot compare things which by their nature and by the\r\ninterval between them are not comparable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have answered your own question,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will expand it. Man\r\nis made of dirt--I saw him made. I am not made of dirt. Man is a\r\nmuseum of diseases, a home of impurities; he comes to-day and is\r\ngone to-morrow; he begins as dirt and departs as stench; I am of the\r\naristocracy of the Imperishables. And man has the Moral Sense. You\r\nunderstand? He has the moral Sense. That would seem to be difference\r\nenough between us, all by itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped there, as if that settled the matter. I was sorry, for at\r\nthat time I had but a dim idea of what the Moral Sense was. I merely\r\nknew that we were proud of having it, and when he talked like that about\r\nit, it wounded me, and I felt as a girl feels who thinks her dearest\r\nfinery is being admired and then overhears strangers making fun of it.\r\nFor a while we were all silent, and I, for one, was depressed. Then\r\nSatan began to chat again, and soon he was sparkling along in such a\r\ncheerful and vivacious vein that my spirits rose once more. He told some\r\nvery cunning things that put us in a gale of laughter; and when he was\r\ntelling about the time that Samson tied the torches to the foxes\' tails\r\nand set them loose in the Philistines\' corn, and Samson sitting on the\r\nfence slapping his thighs and laughing, with the tears running down his\r\ncheeks, and lost his balance and fell off the fence, the memory of that\r\npicture got him to laughing, too, and we did have a most lovely and\r\njolly time. By and by he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going on my errand now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\'t!\xe2\x80\x9d we all said. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\'t go; stay with us. You won\'t come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I will; I give you my word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen? To-night? Say when.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt won\'t be long. You will see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe like you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I you. And as a proof of it I will show you something fine to see.\r\nUsually when I go I merely vanish; but now I will dissolve myself and\r\nlet you see me do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood up, and it was quickly finished. He thinned away and thinned\r\naway until he was a soap-bubble, except that he kept his shape. You\r\ncould see the bushes through him as clearly as you see things through a\r\nsoap-bubble, and all over him played and flashed the delicate iridescent\r\ncolors of the bubble, and along with them was that thing shaped like a\r\nwindow-sash which you always see on the globe of the bubble. You have\r\nseen a bubble strike the carpet and lightly bound along two or\r\nthree times before it bursts. He did that. He sprang--touched the\r\ngrass--bounded--floated along--touched again--and so on, and presently\r\nexploded--puff! and in his place was vacancy.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange and beautiful thing to see. We did not say anything,\r\nbut sat wondering and dreaming and blinking; and finally Seppi roused up\r\nand said, mournfully sighing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose none of it has happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNikolaus sighed and said about the same.\r\n\r\nI was miserable to hear them say it, for it was the same cold fear that\r\nwas in my own mind. Then we saw poor old Father Peter wandering along\r\nback, with his head bent down, searching the ground. When he was pretty\r\nclose to us he looked up and saw us, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow long have you been\r\nhere, boys?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little while, Father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it is since I came by, and maybe you can help me. Did you come up\r\nby the path?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is good. I came the same way. I have lost my wallet. There wasn\'t\r\nmuch in it, but a very little is much to me, for it was all I had. I\r\nsuppose you haven\'t seen anything of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Father, but we will help you hunt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is what I was going to ask you. Why, here it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe hadn\'t noticed it; yet there it lay, right where Satan stood when\r\nhe began to melt--if he did melt and it wasn\'t a delusion. Father Peter\r\npicked it up and looked very much surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is mine,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not the contents. This is fat; mine was\r\nflat; mine was light; this is heavy.\xe2\x80\x9d He opened it; it was stuffed as\r\nfull as it could hold with gold coins. He let us gaze our fill; and\r\nof course we did gaze, for we had never seen so much money at one time\r\nbefore. All our mouths came open to say \xe2\x80\x9cSatan did it!\xe2\x80\x9d but nothing\r\ncame out. There it was, you see--we couldn\'t tell what Satan didn\'t want\r\ntold; he had said so himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoys, did you do this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt made us laugh. And it made him laugh, too, as soon as he thought what\r\na foolish question it was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho has been here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur mouths came open to answer, but stood so for a moment, because\r\nwe couldn\'t say \xe2\x80\x9cNobody,\xe2\x80\x9d for it wouldn\'t be true, and the right word\r\ndidn\'t seem to come; then I thought of the right one, and said it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a human being.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the others, and let their mouths go shut.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Father Peter, and looked at us very severely.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came by here a while ago, and there was no one here, but that is\r\nnothing; some one has been here since. I don\'t mean to say that the\r\nperson didn\'t pass here before you came, and I don\'t mean to say you saw\r\nhim, but some one did pass, that I know. On your honor--you saw no one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a human being.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is sufficient; I know you are telling me the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began to count the money on the path, we on our knees eagerly helping\r\nto stack it in little piles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\'s eleven hundred ducats odd!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOh dear! if it were only\r\nmine--and I need it so!\xe2\x80\x9d and his voice broke and his lips quivered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is yours, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d we all cried out at once, \xe2\x80\x9cevery heller!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--it isn\'t mine. Only four ducats are mine; the rest...!\xe2\x80\x9d He fell to\r\ndreaming, poor old soul, and caressing some of the coins in his hands,\r\nand forgot where he was, sitting there on his heels with his old gray\r\nhead bare; it was pitiful to see. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, waking up, \xe2\x80\x9cit isn\'t\r\nmine. I can\'t account for it. I think some enemy... it must be a trap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNikolaus said: \xe2\x80\x9cFather Peter, with the exception of the astrologer you\r\nhaven\'t a real enemy in the village--nor Marget, either. And not even a\r\nhalf-enemy that\'s rich enough to chance eleven hundred ducats to do you\r\na mean turn. I\'ll ask you if that\'s so or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t get around that argument, and it cheered him up. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\r\nisn\'t mine, you see--it isn\'t mine, in any case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said it in a wistful way, like a person that wouldn\'t be sorry, but\r\nglad, if anybody would contradict him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is yours, Father Peter, and we are witness to it. Aren\'t we, boys?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we are--and we\'ll stand by it, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless your hearts, you do almost persuade me; you do, indeed. If I\r\nhad only a hundred-odd ducats of it! The house is mortgaged for it, and\r\nwe\'ve no home for our heads if we don\'t pay to-morrow. And that four\r\nducats is all we\'ve got in the--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\'s yours, every bit of it, and you\'ve got to take it--we are bail\r\nthat it\'s all right. Aren\'t we, Theodor? Aren\'t we, Seppi?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe two said yes, and Nikolaus stuffed the money back into the shabby old\r\nwallet and made the owner take it. So he said he would use two hundred\r\nof it, for his house was good enough security for that, and would put\r\nthe rest at interest till the rightful owner came for it; and on our\r\nside we must sign a paper showing how he got the money--a paper to\r\nshow to the villagers as proof that he had not got out of his troubles\r\ndishonestly.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4\r\n\r\nIt made immense talk next day, when Father Peter paid Solomon Isaacs in\r\ngold and left the rest of the money with him at interest. Also, there\r\nwas a pleasant change; many people called at the house to congratulate\r\nhim, and a number of cool old friends became kind and friendly again;\r\nand, to top all, Marget was invited to a party.\r\n\r\nAnd there was no mystery; Father Peter told the whole circumstance just\r\nas it happened, and said he could not account for it, only it was the\r\nplain hand of Providence, so far as he could see.\r\n\r\nOne or two shook their heads and said privately it looked more like\r\nthe hand of Satan; and really that seemed a surprisingly good guess for\r\nignorant people like that. Some came slyly buzzing around and tried\r\nto coax us boys to come out and \xe2\x80\x9ctell the truth;\xe2\x80\x9d and promised they\r\nwouldn\'t ever tell, but only wanted to know for their own satisfaction,\r\nbecause the whole thing was so curious. They even wanted to buy the\r\nsecret, and pay money for it; and if we could have invented something\r\nthat would answer--but we couldn\'t; we hadn\'t the ingenuity, so we had\r\nto let the chance go by, and it was a pity.\r\n\r\nWe carried that secret around without any trouble, but the other one,\r\nthe big one, the splendid one, burned the very vitals of us, it was so\r\nhot to get out and we so hot to let it out and astonish people with\r\nit. But we had to keep it in; in fact, it kept itself in. Satan said\r\nit would, and it did. We went off every day and got to ourselves in the\r\nwoods so that we could talk about Satan, and really that was the only\r\nsubject we thought of or cared anything about; and day and night we\r\nwatched for him and hoped he would come, and we got more and more\r\nimpatient all the time. We hadn\'t any interest in the other boys any\r\nmore, and wouldn\'t take part in their games and enterprises. They seemed\r\nso tame, after Satan; and their doings so trifling and commonplace after\r\nhis adventures in antiquity and the constellations, and his miracles and\r\nmeltings and explosions, and all that.\r\n\r\nDuring the first day we were in a state of anxiety on account of one\r\nthing, and we kept going to Father Peter\'s house on one pretext or\r\nanother to keep track of it. That was the gold coin; we were afraid\r\nit would crumble and turn to dust, like fairy money. If it did--But it\r\ndidn\'t. At the end of the day no complaint had been made about it, so\r\nafter that we were satisfied that it was real gold, and dropped the\r\nanxiety out of our minds.\r\n\r\nThere was a question which we wanted to ask Father Peter, and finally\r\nwe went there the second evening, a little diffidently, after drawing\r\nstraws, and I asked it as casually as I could, though it did not sound\r\nas casual as I wanted, because I didn\'t know how:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the Moral Sense, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked down, surprised, over his great spectacles, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\r\nis the faculty which enables us to distinguish good from evil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt threw some light, but not a glare, and I was a little disappointed,\r\nalso to some degree embarrassed. He was waiting for me to go on, so, in\r\ndefault of anything else to say, I asked, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it valuable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cValuable? Heavens! lad, it is the one thing that lifts man above the\r\nbeasts that perish and makes him heir to immortality!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis did not remind me of anything further to say, so I got out, with\r\nthe other boys, and we went away with that indefinite sense you have\r\noften had of being filled but not fatted. They wanted me to explain, but\r\nI was tired.\r\n\r\nWe passed out through the parlor, and there was Marget at the spinnet\r\nteaching Marie Lueger. So one of the deserting pupils was back; and an\r\ninfluential one, too; the others would follow. Marget jumped up and\r\nran and thanked us again, with tears in her eyes--this was the third\r\ntime--for saving her and her uncle from being turned into the street,\r\nand we told her again we hadn\'t done it; but that was her way, she never\r\ncould be grateful enough for anything a person did for her; so we let\r\nher have her say. And as we passed through the garden, there was Wilhelm\r\nMeidling sitting there waiting, for it was getting toward the edge of\r\nthe evening, and he would be asking Marget to take a walk along the\r\nriver with him when she was done with the lesson. He was a young lawyer,\r\nand succeeding fairly well and working his way along, little by little.\r\nHe was very fond of Marget, and she of him. He had not deserted along\r\nwith the others, but had stood his ground all through. His faithfulness\r\nwas not lost on Marget and her uncle. He hadn\'t so very much talent, but\r\nhe was handsome and good, and these are a kind of talents themselves and\r\nhelp along. He asked us how the lesson was getting along, and we told\r\nhim it was about done. And maybe it was so; we didn\'t know anything\r\nabout it, but we judged it would please him, and it did, and didn\'t cost\r\nus anything.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 5\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day comes the astrologer from his crumbling old tower up\r\nthe valley, where he had heard the news, I reckon. He had a private talk\r\nwith us, and we told him what we could, for we were mightily in dread\r\nof him. He sat there studying and studying awhile to himself; then he\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many ducats did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEleven hundred and seven, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he said, as if he were talking to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is ver-y singular.\r\nYes... very strange. A curious coincidence.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he began to ask\r\nquestions, and went over the whole ground from the beginning, we\r\nanswering. By and by he said: \xe2\x80\x9cEleven hundred and six ducats. It is a\r\nlarge sum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeven,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seppi, correcting him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, seven, was it? Of course a ducat more or less isn\'t of consequence,\r\nbut you said eleven hundred and six before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt would not have been safe for us to say he was mistaken, but we knew\r\nhe was. Nikolaus said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe ask pardon for the mistake, but we meant to\r\nsay seven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is no matter, lad; it was merely that I noticed the discrepancy.\r\nIt is several days, and you cannot be expected to remember precisely.\r\nOne is apt to be inexact when there is no particular circumstance to\r\nimpress the count upon the memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there was one, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seppi, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it, my son?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the astrologer, indifferently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst, we all counted the piles of coin, each in turn, and all made it\r\nthe same--eleven hundred and six. But I had slipped one out, for fun,\r\nwhen the count began, and now I slipped it back and said, \'I think there\r\nis a mistake--there are eleven hundred and seven; let us count again.\'\r\nWe did, and of course I was right. They were astonished; then I told how\r\nit came about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe astrologer asked us if this was so, and we said it was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat settles it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI know the thief now. Lads, the money was\r\nstolen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he went away, leaving us very much troubled, and wondering what he\r\ncould mean. In about an hour we found out; for by that time it was all\r\nover the village that Father Peter had been arrested for stealing a\r\ngreat sum of money from the astrologer. Everybody\'s tongue was loose and\r\ngoing. Many said it was not in Father Peter\'s character and must be a\r\nmistake; but the others shook their heads and said misery and want could\r\ndrive a suffering man to almost anything. About one detail there were\r\nno differences; all agreed that Father Peter\'s account of how the\r\nmoney came into his hands was just about unbelievable--it had such an\r\nimpossible look. They said it might have come into the astrologer\'s\r\nhands in some such way, but into Father Peter\'s, never! Our characters\r\nbegan to suffer now. We were Father Peter\'s only witnesses; how much\r\ndid he probably pay us to back up his fantastic tale? People talked that\r\nkind of talk to us pretty freely and frankly, and were full of scoffings\r\nwhen we begged them to believe really we had told only the truth. Our\r\nparents were harder on us than any one else. Our fathers said we were\r\ndisgracing our families, and they commanded us to purge ourselves of our\r\nlie, and there was no limit to their anger when we continued to say we\r\nhad spoken true. Our mothers cried over us and begged us to give back\r\nour bribe and get back our honest names and save our families from\r\nshame, and come out and honorably confess. And at last we were so\r\nworried and harassed that we tried to tell the whole thing, Satan and\r\nall--but no, it wouldn\'t come out. We were hoping and longing all the\r\ntime that Satan would come and help us out of our trouble, but there was\r\nno sign of him.\r\n\r\nWithin an hour after the astrologer\'s talk with us, Father Peter was in\r\nprison and the money sealed up and in the hands of the officers of the\r\nlaw. The money was in a bag, and Solomon Isaacs said he had not touched\r\nit since he had counted it; his oath was taken that it was the same\r\nmoney, and that the amount was eleven hundred and seven ducats. Father\r\nPeter claimed trial by the ecclesiastical court, but our other priest,\r\nFather Adolf, said an ecclesiastical court hadn\'t jurisdiction over a\r\nsuspended priest. The bishop upheld him. That settled it; the case would\r\ngo to trial in the civil court. The court would not sit for some time to\r\ncome. Wilhelm Meidling would be Father Peter\'s lawyer and do the best he\r\ncould, of course, but he told us privately that a weak case on his side\r\nand all the power and prejudice on the other made the outlook bad.\r\n\r\nSo Marget\'s new happiness died a quick death. No friends came to\r\ncondole with her, and none were expected; an unsigned note withdrew her\r\ninvitation to the party. There would be no scholars to take lessons.\r\nHow could she support herself? She could remain in the house, for the\r\nmortgage was paid off, though the government and not poor Solomon Isaacs\r\nhad the mortgage-money in its grip for the present. Old Ursula, who\r\nwas cook, chambermaid, housekeeper, laundress, and everything else for\r\nFather Peter, and had been Marget\'s nurse in earlier years, said\r\nGod would provide. But she said that from habit, for she was a good\r\nChristian. She meant to help in the providing, to make sure, if she\r\ncould find a way.\r\n\r\nWe boys wanted to go and see Marget and show friendliness for her, but\r\nour parents were afraid of offending the community and wouldn\'t let\r\nus. The astrologer was going around inflaming everybody against Father\r\nPeter, and saying he was an abandoned thief and had stolen eleven\r\nhundred and seven gold ducats from him. He said he knew he was a thief\r\nfrom that fact, for it was exactly the sum he had lost and which Father\r\nPeter pretended he had \xe2\x80\x9cfound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of the fourth day after the catastrophe old Ursula\r\nappeared at our house and asked for some washing to do, and begged my\r\nmother to keep this secret, to save Marget\'s pride, who would stop this\r\nproject if she found it out, yet Marget had not enough to eat and was\r\ngrowing weak. Ursula was growing weak herself, and showed it; and she\r\nate of the food that was offered her like a starving person, but could\r\nnot be persuaded to carry any home, for Marget would not eat charity\r\nfood. She took some clothes down to the stream to wash them, but we saw\r\nfrom the window that handling the bat was too much for her strength;\r\nso she was called back and a trifle of money offered her, which she was\r\nafraid to take lest Marget should suspect; then she took it, saying she\r\nwould explain that she found it in the road. To keep it from being a lie\r\nand damning her soul, she got me to drop it while she watched; then she\r\nwent along by there and found it, and exclaimed with surprise and joy,\r\nand picked it up and went her way. Like the rest of the village, she\r\ncould tell every-day lies fast enough and without taking any precautions\r\nagainst fire and brimstone on their account; but this was a new kind of\r\nlie, and it had a dangerous look because she hadn\'t had any practice in\r\nit. After a week\'s practice it wouldn\'t have given her any trouble. It\r\nis the way we are made.\r\n\r\nI was in trouble, for how would Marget live? Ursula could not find a\r\ncoin in the road every day--perhaps not even a second one. And I was\r\nashamed, too, for not having been near Marget, and she so in need of\r\nfriends; but that was my parents\' fault, not mine, and I couldn\'t help\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI was walking along the path, feeling very down-hearted, when a most\r\ncheery and tingling freshening-up sensation went rippling through me,\r\nand I was too glad for any words, for I knew by that sign that Satan was\r\nby. I had noticed it before. Next moment he was alongside of me and I\r\nwas telling him all my trouble and what had been happening to Marget and\r\nher uncle. While we were talking we turned a curve and saw old Ursula\r\nresting in the shade of a tree, and she had a lean stray kitten in her\r\nlap and was petting it. I asked her where she got it, and she said it\r\ncame out of the woods and followed her; and she said it probably hadn\'t\r\nany mother or any friends and she was going to take it home and take\r\ncare of it. Satan said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand you are very poor. Why do you want to add another mouth to\r\nfeed? Why don\'t you give it to some rich person?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUrsula bridled at this and said: \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you would like to have it. You\r\nmust be rich, with your fine clothes and quality airs.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she sniffed\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x9cGive it to the rich--the idea! The rich don\'t care for\r\nanybody but themselves; it\'s only the poor that have feeling for\r\nthe poor, and help them. The poor and God. God will provide for this\r\nkitten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUrsula\'s eyes snapped with anger. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I know it!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cNot a\r\nsparrow falls to the ground without His seeing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it falls, just the same. What good is seeing it fall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Ursula\'s jaws worked, but she could not get any word out for the\r\nmoment, she was so horrified. When she got her tongue, she stormed out,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo about your business, you puppy, or I will take a stick to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not speak, I was so scared. I knew that with his notions about\r\nthe human race Satan would consider it a matter of no consequence to\r\nstrike her dead, there being \xe2\x80\x9cplenty more\xe2\x80\x9d; but my tongue stood still,\r\nI could give her no warning. But nothing happened; Satan remained\r\ntranquil--tranquil and indifferent. I suppose he could not be insulted\r\nby Ursula any more than the king could be insulted by a tumble-bug. The\r\nold woman jumped to her feet when she made her remark, and did it as\r\nbriskly as a young girl. It had been many years since she had done the\r\nlike of that. That was Satan\'s influence; he was a fresh breeze to the\r\nweak and the sick, wherever he came. His presence affected even the lean\r\nkitten, and it skipped to the ground and began to chase a leaf. This\r\nsurprised Ursula, and she stood looking at the creature and nodding her\r\nhead wonderingly, her anger quite forgotten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\'s come over it?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAwhile ago it could hardly walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not seen a kitten of that breed before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Satan.\r\n\r\nUrsula was not proposing to be friendly with the mocking stranger, and\r\nshe gave him an ungentle look and retorted: \xe2\x80\x9cWho asked you to come here\r\nand pester me, I\'d like to know? And what do you know about what I\'ve\r\nseen and what I haven\'t seen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\'t seen a kitten with the hair-spines on its tongue pointing\r\nto the front, have you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--nor you, either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, examine this one and see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUrsula was become pretty spry, but the kitten was spryer, and she could\r\nnot catch it, and had to give it up. Then Satan said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it a name, and maybe it will come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUrsula tried several names, but the kitten was not interested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall it Agnes. Try that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe creature answered to the name and came. Ursula examined its tongue.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word, it\'s true!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not seen this kind of a cat\r\nbefore. Is it yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen how did you know its name so pat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause all cats of that breed are named Agnes; they will not answer to\r\nany other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUrsula was impressed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the most wonderful thing!\xe2\x80\x9d Then a shadow of\r\ntrouble came into her face, for her superstitions were aroused, and she\r\nreluctantly put the creature down, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I must let it go;\r\nI am not afraid--no, not exactly that, though the priest--well, I\'ve\r\nheard people--indeed, many people... And, besides, it is quite well now\r\nand can take care of itself.\xe2\x80\x9d She sighed, and turned to go, murmuring:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is such a pretty one, too, and would be such company--and the house\r\nis so sad and lonesome these troubled days... Miss Marget so mournful\r\nand just a shadow, and the old master shut up in jail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems a pity not to keep it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Satan.\r\n\r\nUrsula turned quickly--just as if she were hoping some one would\r\nencourage her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, wistfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause this breed brings luck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes it? Is it true? Young man, do you know it to be true? How does it\r\nbring luck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it brings money, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUrsula looked disappointed. \xe2\x80\x9cMoney? A cat bring money? The idea! You\r\ncould never sell it here; people do not buy cats here; one can\'t even\r\ngive them away.\xe2\x80\x9d She turned to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\'t mean sell it. I mean have an income from it. This kind is\r\ncalled the Lucky Cat. Its owner finds four silver groschen in his pocket\r\nevery morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw the indignation rising in the old woman\'s face. She was insulted.\r\nThis boy was making fun of her. That was her thought. She thrust her\r\nhands into her pockets and straightened up to give him a piece of her\r\nmind. Her temper was all up, and hot. Her mouth came open and let out\r\nthree words of a bitter sentence,... then it fell silent, and the anger\r\nin her face turned to surprise or wonder or fear, or something, and she\r\nslowly brought out her hands from her pockets and opened them and held\r\nthem so. In one was my piece of money, in the other lay four silver\r\ngroschen. She gazed a little while, perhaps to see if the groschen would\r\nvanish away; then she said, fervently:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\'s true--it\'s true--and I\'m ashamed and beg forgiveness, O dear\r\nmaster and benefactor!\xe2\x80\x9d And she ran to Satan and kissed his hand, over\r\nand over again, according to the Austrian custom.\r\n\r\nIn her heart she probably believed it was a witch-cat and an agent of\r\nthe Devil; but no matter, it was all the more certain to be able to\r\nkeep its contract and furnish a daily good living for the family, for\r\nin matters of finance even the piousest of our peasants would have more\r\nconfidence in an arrangement with the Devil than with an archangel.\r\nUrsula started homeward, with Agnes in her arms, and I said I wished I\r\nhad her privilege of seeing Marget.\r\n\r\nThen I caught my breath, for we were there. There in the parlor, and\r\nMarget standing looking at us, astonished. She was feeble and pale, but\r\nI knew that those conditions would not last in Satan\'s atmosphere, and\r\nit turned out so. I introduced Satan--that is, Philip Traum--and we sat\r\ndown and talked. There was no constraint. We were simple folk, in our\r\nvillage, and when a stranger was a pleasant person we were soon friends.\r\nMarget wondered how we got in without her hearing us. Traum said the\r\ndoor was open, and we walked in and waited until she should turn around\r\nand greet us. This was not true; no door was open; we entered through\r\nthe walls or the roof or down the chimney, or somehow; but no matter,\r\nwhat Satan wished a person to believe, the person was sure to believe,\r\nand so Marget was quite satisfied with that explanation. And then the\r\nmain part of her mind was on Traum, anyway; she couldn\'t keep her eyes\r\noff him, he was so beautiful. That gratified me, and made me proud. I\r\nhoped he would show off some, but he didn\'t. He seemed only interested\r\nin being friendly and telling lies. He said he was an orphan. That made\r\nMarget pity him. The water came into her eyes. He said he had never\r\nknown his mamma; she passed away while he was a young thing; and said\r\nhis papa was in shattered health, and had no property to speak of--in\r\nfact, none of any earthly value--but he had an uncle in business down\r\nin the tropics, and he was very well off and had a monopoly, and it was\r\nfrom this uncle that he drew his support. The very mention of a kind\r\nuncle was enough to remind Marget of her own, and her eyes filled again.\r\nShe said she hoped their two uncles would meet, some day. It made me\r\nshudder. Philip said he hoped so, too; and that made me shudder again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe they will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marget. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes your uncle travel much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, he goes all about; he has business everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so they went on chatting, and poor Marget forgot her sorrow for one\r\nlittle while, anyway. It was probably the only really bright and cheery\r\nhour she had known lately. I saw she liked Philip, and I knew she would.\r\nAnd when he told her he was studying for the ministry I could see that\r\nshe liked him better than ever. And then, when he promised to get her\r\nadmitted to the jail so that she could see her uncle, that was the\r\ncapstone. He said he would give the guards a little present, and she\r\nmust always go in the evening after dark, and say nothing, \xe2\x80\x9cbut just\r\nshow this paper and pass in, and show it again when you come out\xe2\x80\x9d--and\r\nhe scribbled some queer marks on the paper and gave it to her, and she\r\nwas ever so thankful, and right away was in a fever for the sun to go\r\ndown; for in that old, cruel time prisoners were not allowed to see\r\ntheir friends, and sometimes they spent years in the jails without ever\r\nseeing a friendly face. I judged that the marks on the paper were an\r\nenchantment, and that the guards would not know what they were doing,\r\nnor have any memory of it afterward; and that was indeed the way of it.\r\nUrsula put her head in at the door now and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSupper\'s ready, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she saw us and looked frightened, and\r\nmotioned me to come to her, which I did, and she asked if we had told\r\nabout the cat. I said no, and she was relieved, and said please don\'t;\r\nfor if Miss Marget knew, she would think it was an unholy cat and would\r\nsend for a priest and have its gifts all purified out of it, and then\r\nthere wouldn\'t be any more dividends. So I said we wouldn\'t tell, and\r\nshe was satisfied. Then I was beginning to say good-by to Marget, but\r\nSatan interrupted and said, ever so politely--well, I don\'t remember\r\njust the words, but anyway he as good as invited himself to supper,\r\nand me, too. Of course Marget was miserably embarrassed, for she had\r\nno reason to suppose there would be half enough for a sick bird. Ursula\r\nheard him, and she came straight into the room, not a bit pleased. At\r\nfirst she was astonished to see Marget looking so fresh and rosy, and\r\nsaid so; then she spoke up in her native tongue, which was Bohemian, and\r\nsaid--as I learned afterward--\xe2\x80\x9cSend him away, Miss Marget; there\'s not\r\nvictuals enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore Marget could speak, Satan had the word, and was talking back to\r\nUrsula in her own language--which was a surprise to her, and for her\r\nmistress, too. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\'t I see you down the road awhile ago?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that pleases me; I see you remember me.\xe2\x80\x9d He stepped to her and\r\nwhispered: \xe2\x80\x9cI told you it is a Lucky Cat. Don\'t be troubled; it will\r\nprovide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat sponged the slate of Ursula\'s feelings clean of its anxieties, and\r\na deep, financial joy shone in her eyes. The cat\'s value was augmenting.\r\nIt was getting full time for Marget to take some sort of notice of\r\nSatan\'s invitation, and she did it in the best way, the honest way that\r\nwas natural to her. She said she had little to offer, but that we were\r\nwelcome if we would share it with her.\r\n\r\nWe had supper in the kitchen, and Ursula waited at table. A small fish\r\nwas in the frying-pan, crisp and brown and tempting, and one could see\r\nthat Marget was not expecting such respectable food as this. Ursula\r\nbrought it, and Marget divided it between Satan and me, declining to\r\ntake any of it herself; and was beginning to say she did not care for\r\nfish to-day, but she did not finish the remark. It was because she\r\nnoticed that another fish had appeared in the pan. She looked surprised,\r\nbut did not say anything. She probably meant to inquire of Ursula about\r\nthis later. There were other surprises: flesh and game and wines and\r\nfruits--things which had been strangers in that house lately; but Marget\r\nmade no exclamations, and now even looked unsurprised, which was Satan\'s\r\ninfluence, of course. Satan talked right along, and was entertaining,\r\nand made the time pass pleasantly and cheerfully; and although he told a\r\ngood many lies, it was no harm in him, for he was only an angel and did\r\nnot know any better. They do not know right from wrong; I knew this,\r\nbecause I remembered what he had said about it. He got on the good side\r\nof Ursula. He praised her to Marget, confidentially, but speaking just\r\nloud enough for Ursula to hear. He said she was a fine woman, and he\r\nhoped some day to bring her and his uncle together. Very soon Ursula was\r\nmincing and simpering around in a ridiculous girly way, and smoothing\r\nout her gown and prinking at herself like a foolish old hen, and all\r\nthe time pretending she was not hearing what Satan was saying. I was\r\nashamed, for it showed us to be what Satan considered us, a silly race\r\nand trivial. Satan said his uncle entertained a great deal, and to\r\nhave a clever woman presiding over the festivities would double the\r\nattractions of the place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your uncle is a gentleman, isn\'t he?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Marget.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Satan indifferently; \xe2\x80\x9csome even call him a Prince, out of\r\ncompliment, but he is not bigoted; to him personal merit is everything,\r\nrank nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy hand was hanging down by my chair; Agnes came along and licked it; by\r\nthis act a secret was revealed. I started to say, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is all a mistake;\r\nthis is just a common, ordinary cat; the hair-needles on her tongue\r\npoint inward, not outward.\xe2\x80\x9d But the words did not come, because they\r\ncouldn\'t. Satan smiled upon me, and I understood.\r\n\r\nWhen it was dark Marget took food and wine and fruit, in a basket, and\r\nhurried away to the jail, and Satan and I walked toward my home. I was\r\nthinking to myself that I should like to see what the inside of the jail\r\nwas like; Satan overheard the thought, and the next moment we were\r\nin the jail. We were in the torture-chamber, Satan said. The rack was\r\nthere, and the other instruments, and there was a smoky lantern or\r\ntwo hanging on the walls and helping to make the place look dim and\r\ndreadful. There were people there--and executioners--but as they took\r\nno notice of us, it meant that we were invisible. A young man lay bound,\r\nand Satan said he was suspected of being a heretic, and the executioners\r\nwere about to inquire into it. They asked the man to confess to the\r\ncharge, and he said he could not, for it was not true. Then they drove\r\nsplinter after splinter under his nails, and he shrieked with the\r\npain. Satan was not disturbed, but I could not endure it, and had to be\r\nwhisked out of there. I was faint and sick, but the fresh air revived\r\nme, and we walked toward my home. I said it was a brutal thing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it was a human thing. You should not insult the brutes by such a\r\nmisuse of that word; they have not deserved it,\xe2\x80\x9d and he went on talking\r\nlike that. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is like your paltry race--always lying, always claiming\r\nvirtues which it hasn\'t got, always denying them to the higher animals,\r\nwhich alone possess them. No brute ever does a cruel thing--that is the\r\nmonopoly of those with the Moral Sense. When a brute inflicts pain he\r\ndoes it innocently; it is not wrong; for him there is no such thing\r\nas wrong. And he does not inflict pain for the pleasure of inflicting\r\nit--only man does that. Inspired by that mongrel Moral Sense of his!\r\nA sense whose function is to distinguish between right and wrong, with\r\nliberty to choose which of them he will do. Now what advantage can he\r\nget out of that? He is always choosing, and in nine cases out of ten he\r\nprefers the wrong. There shouldn\'t be any wrong; and without the Moral\r\nSense there couldn\'t be any. And yet he is such an unreasoning creature\r\nthat he is not able to perceive that the Moral Sense degrades him to the\r\nbottom layer of animated beings and is a shameful possession. Are you\r\nfeeling better? Let me show you something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6\r\n\r\nIn a moment we were in a French village. We walked through a great\r\nfactory of some sort, where men and women and little children were\r\ntoiling in heat and dirt and a fog of dust; and they were clothed in\r\nrags, and drooped at their work, for they were worn and half starved,\r\nand weak and drowsy. Satan said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is some more Moral Sense. The proprietors are rich, and very holy;\r\nbut the wage they pay to these poor brothers and sisters of theirs is\r\nonly enough to keep them from dropping dead with hunger. The work-hours\r\nare fourteen per day, winter and summer--from six in the morning till\r\neight at night--little children and all. And they walk to and from the\r\npigsties which they inhabit--four miles each way, through mud and slush,\r\nrain, snow, sleet, and storm, daily, year in and year out. They get\r\nfour hours of sleep. They kennel together, three families in a room, in\r\nunimaginable filth and stench; and disease comes, and they die off like\r\nflies. Have they committed a crime, these mangy things? No. What have\r\nthey done, that they are punished so? Nothing at all, except getting\r\nthemselves born into your foolish race. You have seen how they treat a\r\nmisdoer there in the jail; now you see how they treat the innocent\r\nand the worthy. Is your race logical? Are these ill-smelling innocents\r\nbetter off than that heretic? Indeed, no; his punishment is trivial\r\ncompared with theirs. They broke him on the wheel and smashed him\r\nto rags and pulp after we left, and he is dead now, and free of your\r\nprecious race; but these poor slaves here--why, they have been dying for\r\nyears, and some of them will not escape from life for years to come. It\r\nis the Moral Sense which teaches the factory proprietors the difference\r\nbetween right and wrong--you perceive the result. They think themselves\r\nbetter than dogs. Ah, you are such an illogical, unreasoning race! And\r\npaltry--oh, unspeakably!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he dropped all seriousness and just overstrained himself making fun\r\nof us, and deriding our pride in our warlike deeds, our great heroes,\r\nour imperishable fames, our mighty kings, our ancient aristocracies, our\r\nvenerable history--and laughed and laughed till it was enough to make a\r\nperson sick to hear him; and finally he sobered a little and said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\r\nafter all, it is not all ridiculous; there is a sort of pathos about it\r\nwhen one remembers how few are your days, how childish your pomps, and\r\nwhat shadows you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPresently all things vanished suddenly from my sight, and I knew what\r\nit meant. The next moment we were walking along in our village; and down\r\ntoward the river I saw the twinkling lights of the Golden Stag. Then in\r\nthe dark I heard a joyful cry:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\'s come again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Seppi Wohlmeyer. He had felt his blood leap and his spirits rise\r\nin a way that could mean only one thing, and he knew Satan was near,\r\nalthough it was too dark to see him. He came to us, and we walked along\r\ntogether, and Seppi poured out his gladness like water. It was as if he\r\nwere a lover and had found his sweetheart who had been lost. Seppi was\r\na smart and animated boy, and had enthusiasm and expression, and was\r\na contrast to Nikolaus and me. He was full of the last new mystery,\r\nnow--the disappearance of Hans Oppert, the village loafer. People\r\nwere beginning to be curious about it, he said. He did not say\r\nanxious--curious was the right word, and strong enough. No one had seen\r\nHans for a couple of days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot since he did that brutal thing, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat brutal thing?\xe2\x80\x9d It was Satan that asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he is always clubbing his dog, which is a good dog, and his only\r\nfriend, and is faithful, and loves him, and does no one any harm;\r\nand two days ago he was at it again, just for nothing--just for\r\npleasure--and the dog was howling and begging, and Theodor and I begged,\r\ntoo, but he threatened us, and struck the dog again with all his might\r\nand knocked one of his eyes out, and he said to us, \'There, I hope\r\nyou are satisfied now; that\'s what you have got for him by your damned\r\nmeddling\'--and he laughed, the heartless brute.\xe2\x80\x9d Seppi\'s voice trembled\r\nwith pity and anger. I guessed what Satan would say, and he said it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is that misused word again--that shabby slander. Brutes do not\r\nact like that, but only men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it was inhuman, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it wasn\'t, Seppi; it was human--quite distinctly human. It is not\r\npleasant to hear you libel the higher animals by attributing to them\r\ndispositions which they are free from, and which are found nowhere\r\nbut in the human heart. None of the higher animals is tainted with the\r\ndisease called the Moral Sense. Purify your language, Seppi; drop those\r\nlying phrases out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke pretty sternly--for him--and I was sorry I hadn\'t warned Seppi\r\nto be more particular about the word he used. I knew how he was feeling.\r\nHe would not want to offend Satan; he would rather offend all his kin.\r\nThere was an uncomfortable silence, but relief soon came, for that poor\r\ndog came along now, with his eye hanging down, and went straight to\r\nSatan, and began to moan and mutter brokenly, and Satan began to answer\r\nin the same way, and it was plain that they were talking together in the\r\ndog language. We all sat down in the grass, in the moonlight, for the\r\nclouds were breaking away now, and Satan took the dog\'s head in his lap\r\nand put the eye back in its place, and the dog was comfortable, and he\r\nwagged his tail and licked Satan\'s hand, and looked thankful and said\r\nthe same; I knew he was saying it, though I did not understand the\r\nwords. Then the two talked together a bit, and Satan said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says his master was drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he was,\xe2\x80\x9d said we.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd an hour later he fell over the precipice there beyond the Cliff\r\nPasture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe know the place; it is three miles from here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the dog has been often to the village, begging people to go there,\r\nbut he was only driven away and not listened to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe remembered it, but hadn\'t understood what he wanted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe only wanted help for the man who had misused him, and he thought\r\nonly of that, and has had no food nor sought any. He has watched by his\r\nmaster two nights. What do you think of your race? Is heaven reserved\r\nfor it, and this dog ruled out, as your teachers tell you? Can your race\r\nadd anything to this dog\'s stock of morals and magnanimities?\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke\r\nto the creature, who jumped up, eager and happy, and apparently ready\r\nfor orders and impatient to execute them. \xe2\x80\x9cGet some men; go with the\r\ndog--he will show you that carrion; and take a priest along to arrange\r\nabout insurance, for death is near.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith the last word he vanished, to our sorrow and disappointment. We got\r\nthe men and Father Adolf, and we saw the man die. Nobody cared but the\r\ndog; he mourned and grieved, and licked the dead face, and could not be\r\ncomforted. We buried him where he was, and without a coffin, for he had\r\nno money, and no friend but the dog. If we had been an hour earlier the\r\npriest would have been in time to send that poor creature to heaven, but\r\nnow he was gone down into the awful fires, to burn forever. It seemed\r\nsuch a pity that in a world where so many people have difficulty to put\r\nin their time, one little hour could not have been spared for this\r\npoor creature who needed it so much, and to whom it would have made the\r\ndifference between eternal joy and eternal pain. It gave an appalling\r\nidea of the value of an hour, and I thought I could never waste one\r\nagain without remorse and terror. Seppi was depressed and grieved, and\r\nsaid it must be so much better to be a dog and not run such awful risks.\r\nWe took this one home with us and kept him for our own. Seppi had a very\r\ngood thought as we were walking along, and it cheered us up and made us\r\nfeel much better. He said the dog had forgiven the man that had wronged\r\nhim so, and maybe God would accept that absolution.\r\n\r\nThere was a very dull week, now, for Satan did not come, nothing much\r\nwas going on, and we boys could not venture to go and see Marget,\r\nbecause the nights were moonlit and our parents might find us out if we\r\ntried. But we came across Ursula a couple of times taking a walk in the\r\nmeadows beyond the river to air the cat, and we learned from her\r\nthat things were going well. She had natty new clothes on and bore a\r\nprosperous look. The four groschen a day were arriving without a break,\r\nbut were not being spent for food and wine and such things--the cat\r\nattended to all that.\r\n\r\nMarget was enduring her forsakenness and isolation fairly well, all\r\nthings considered, and was cheerful, by help of Wilhelm Meidling. She\r\nspent an hour or two every night in the jail with her uncle, and had\r\nfattened him up with the cat\'s contributions. But she was curious to\r\nknow more about Philip Traum, and hoped I would bring him again. Ursula\r\nwas curious about him herself, and asked a good many questions about his\r\nuncle. It made the boys laugh, for I had told them the nonsense Satan\r\nhad been stuffing her with. She got no satisfaction out of us, our\r\ntongues being tied.\r\n\r\nUrsula gave us a small item of information: money being plenty now,\r\nshe had taken on a servant to help about the house and run errands. She\r\ntried to tell it in a commonplace, matter-of-course way, but she was so\r\nset up by it and so vain of it that her pride in it leaked out pretty\r\nplainly. It was beautiful to see her veiled delight in this grandeur,\r\npoor old thing, but when we heard the name of the servant we wondered\r\nif she had been altogether wise; for although we were young, and often\r\nthoughtless, we had fairly good perception on some matters. This boy was\r\nGottfried Narr, a dull, good creature, with no harm in him and nothing\r\nagainst him personally; still, he was under a cloud, and properly so,\r\nfor it had not been six months since a social blight had mildewed the\r\nfamily--his grandmother had been burned as a witch. When that kind of\r\na malady is in the blood it does not always come out with just one\r\nburning. Just now was not a good time for Ursula and Marget to be having\r\ndealings with a member of such a family, for the witch-terror had risen\r\nhigher during the past year than it had ever reached in the memory of\r\nthe oldest villagers. The mere mention of a witch was almost enough to\r\nfrighten us out of our wits. This was natural enough, because of late\r\nyears there were more kinds of witches than there used to be; in old\r\ntimes it had been only old women, but of late years they were of all\r\nages--even children of eight and nine; it was getting so that anybody\r\nmight turn out to be a familiar of the Devil--age and sex hadn\'t\r\nanything to do with it. In our little region we had tried to extirpate\r\nthe witches, but the more of them we burned the more of the breed rose\r\nup in their places.\r\n\r\nOnce, in a school for girls only ten miles away, the teachers found that\r\nthe back of one of the girls was all red and inflamed, and they were\r\ngreatly frightened, believing it to be the Devil\'s marks. The girl was\r\nscared, and begged them not to denounce her, and said it was only fleas;\r\nbut of course it would not do to let the matter rest there. All the\r\ngirls were examined, and eleven out of the fifty were badly marked, the\r\nrest less so. A commission was appointed, but the eleven only cried for\r\ntheir mothers and would not confess. Then they were shut up, each by\r\nherself, in the dark, and put on black bread and water for ten days and\r\nnights; and by that time they were haggard and wild, and their eyes were\r\ndry and they did not cry any more, but only sat and mumbled, and would\r\nnot take the food. Then one of them confessed, and said they had often\r\nridden through the air on broomsticks to the witches\' Sabbath, and in a\r\nbleak place high up in the mountains had danced and drunk and caroused\r\nwith several hundred other witches and the Evil One, and all had\r\nconducted themselves in a scandalous way and had reviled the priests and\r\nblasphemed God. That is what she said--not in narrative form, for she\r\nwas not able to remember any of the details without having them called\r\nto her mind one after the other; but the commission did that, for they\r\nknew just what questions to ask, they being all written down for the use\r\nof witch-commissioners two centuries before. They asked, \xe2\x80\x9cDid you do so\r\nand so?\xe2\x80\x9d and she always said yes, and looked weary and tired, and\r\ntook no interest in it. And so when the other ten heard that this one\r\nconfessed, they confessed, too, and answered yes to the questions. Then\r\nthey were burned at the stake all together, which was just and right;\r\nand everybody went from all the countryside to see it. I went, too; but\r\nwhen I saw that one of them was a bonny, sweet girl I used to play with,\r\nand looked so pitiful there chained to the stake, and her mother crying\r\nover her and devouring her with kisses and clinging around her neck, and\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God! Oh, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d it was too dreadful, and I went away.\r\n\r\nIt was bitter cold weather when Gottfried\'s grandmother was burned. It\r\nwas charged that she had cured bad headaches by kneading the person\'s\r\nhead and neck with her fingers--as she said--but really by the Devil\'s\r\nhelp, as everybody knew. They were going to examine her, but she stopped\r\nthem, and confessed straight off that her power was from the Devil. So\r\nthey appointed to burn her next morning, early, in our market-square.\r\nThe officer who was to prepare the fire was there first, and prepared\r\nit. She was there next--brought by the constables, who left her and went\r\nto fetch another witch. Her family did not come with her. They might be\r\nreviled, maybe stoned, if the people were excited. I came, and gave her\r\nan apple. She was squatting at the fire, warming herself and waiting;\r\nand her old lips and hands were blue with the cold. A stranger came\r\nnext. He was a traveler, passing through; and he spoke to her gently,\r\nand, seeing nobody but me there to hear, said he was sorry for her.\r\nAnd he asked if what she confessed was true, and she said no. He looked\r\nsurprised and still more sorry then, and asked her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why did you confess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am old and very poor,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I work for my living. There\r\nwas no way but to confess. If I hadn\'t they might have set me free.\r\nThat would ruin me, for no one would forget that I had been suspected of\r\nbeing a witch, and so I would get no more work, and wherever I went they\r\nwould set the dogs on me. In a little while I would starve. The fire is\r\nbest; it is soon over. You have been good to me, you two, and I thank\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe snuggled closer to the fire, and put out her hands to warm them, the\r\nsnow-flakes descending soft and still on her old gray head and making\r\nit white and whiter. The crowd was gathering now, and an egg came flying\r\nand struck her in the eye, and broke and ran down her face. There was a\r\nlaugh at that.\r\n\r\nI told Satan all about the eleven girls and the old woman, once, but\r\nit did not affect him. He only said it was the human race, and what the\r\nhuman race did was of no consequence. And he said he had seen it made;\r\nand it was not made of clay; it was made of mud--part of it was, anyway.\r\nI knew what he meant by that--the Moral Sense. He saw the thought in my\r\nhead, and it tickled him and made him laugh. Then he called a bullock\r\nout of a pasture and petted it and talked with it, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere--he wouldn\'t drive children mad with hunger and fright and\r\nloneliness, and then burn them for confessing to things invented for\r\nthem which had never happened. And neither would he break the hearts of\r\ninnocent, poor old women and make them afraid to trust themselves among\r\ntheir own race; and he would not insult them in their death-agony. For\r\nhe is not besmirched with the Moral Sense, but is as the angels are, and\r\nknows no wrong, and never does it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLovely as he was, Satan could be cruelly offensive when he chose; and he\r\nalways chose when the human race was brought to his attention. He always\r\nturned up his nose at it, and never had a kind word for it.\r\n\r\nWell, as I was saying, we boys doubted if it was a good time for Ursula\r\nto be hiring a member of the Narr family. We were right. When the people\r\nfound it out they were naturally indignant. And, moreover, since Marget\r\nand Ursula hadn\'t enough to eat themselves, where was the money coming\r\nfrom to feed another mouth? That is what they wanted to know; and in\r\norder to find out they stopped avoiding Gottfried and began to seek his\r\nsociety and have sociable conversations with him. He was pleased--not\r\nthinking any harm and not seeing the trap--and so he talked innocently\r\nalong, and was no discreeter than a cow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoney!\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cthey\'ve got plenty of it. They pay me two groschen a\r\nweek, besides my keep. And they live on the fat of the land, I can tell\r\nyou; the prince himself can\'t beat their table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis astonishing statement was conveyed by the astrologer to Father\r\nAdolf on a Sunday morning when he was returning from mass. He was deeply\r\nmoved, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis must be looked into.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said there must be witchcraft at the bottom of it, and told the\r\nvillagers to resume relations with Marget and Ursula in a private and\r\nunostentatious way, and keep both eyes open. They were told to keep\r\ntheir own counsel, and not rouse the suspicions of the household. The\r\nvillagers were at first a bit reluctant to enter such a dreadful place,\r\nbut the priest said they would be under his protection while there, and\r\nno harm could come to them, particularly if they carried a trifle of\r\nholy water along and kept their beads and crosses handy. This satisfied\r\nthem and made them willing to go; envy and malice made the baser sort\r\neven eager to go.\r\n\r\nAnd so poor Marget began to have company again, and was as pleased as\r\na cat. She was like \'most anybody else--just human, and happy in her\r\nprosperities and not averse from showing them off a little; and she was\r\nhumanly grateful to have the warm shoulder turned to her and be smiled\r\nupon by her friends and the village again; for of all the hard things to\r\nbear, to be cut by your neighbors and left in contemptuous solitude is\r\nmaybe the hardest.\r\n\r\nThe bars were down, and we could all go there now, and we did--our\r\nparents and all--day after day. The cat began to strain herself.\r\nShe provided the top of everything for those companies, and in\r\nabundance--among them many a dish and many a wine which they had not\r\ntasted before and which they had not even heard of except at second-hand\r\nfrom the prince\'s servants. And the tableware was much above ordinary,\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nMarget was troubled at times, and pursued Ursula with questions to an\r\nuncomfortable degree; but Ursula stood her ground and stuck to it that\r\nit was Providence, and said no word about the cat. Marget knew that\r\nnothing was impossible to Providence, but she could not help having\r\ndoubts that this effort was from there, though she was afraid to say so,\r\nlest disaster come of it. Witchcraft occurred to her, but she put the\r\nthought aside, for this was before Gottfried joined the household, and\r\nshe knew Ursula was pious and a bitter hater of witches. By the time\r\nGottfried arrived Providence was established, unshakably intrenched,\r\nand getting all the gratitude. The cat made no murmur, but went on\r\ncomposedly improving in style and prodigality by experience.\r\n\r\nIn any community, big or little, there is always a fair proportion\r\nof people who are not malicious or unkind by nature, and who never do\r\nunkind things except when they are overmastered by fear, or when\r\ntheir self-interest is greatly in danger, or some such matter as that.\r\nEseldorf had its proportion of such people, and ordinarily their good\r\nand gentle influence was felt, but these were not ordinary times--on\r\naccount of the witch-dread--and so we did not seem to have any gentle\r\nand compassionate hearts left, to speak of. Every person was frightened\r\nat the unaccountable state of things at Marget\'s house, not doubting\r\nthat witchcraft was at the bottom of it, and fright frenzied their\r\nreason. Naturally there were some who pitied Marget and Ursula for the\r\ndanger that was gathering about them, but naturally they did not say so;\r\nit would not have been safe. So the others had it all their own way,\r\nand there was none to advise the ignorant girl and the foolish woman and\r\nwarn them to modify their doings. We boys wanted to warn them, but we\r\nbacked down when it came to the pinch, being afraid. We found that we\r\nwere not manly enough nor brave enough to do a generous action when\r\nthere was a chance that it could get us into trouble. Neither of us\r\nconfessed this poor spirit to the others, but did as other people would\r\nhave done--dropped the subject and talked about something else. And I\r\nknew we all felt mean, eating and drinking Marget\'s fine things along\r\nwith those companies of spies, and petting her and complimenting her\r\nwith the rest, and seeing with self-reproach how foolishly happy she\r\nwas, and never saying a word to put her on her guard. And, indeed, she\r\nwas happy, and as proud as a princess, and so grateful to have friends\r\nagain. And all the time these people were watching with all their eyes\r\nand reporting all they saw to Father Adolf.\r\n\r\nBut he couldn\'t make head or tail of the situation. There must be an\r\nenchanter somewhere on the premises, but who was it? Marget was not seen\r\nto do any jugglery, nor was Ursula, nor yet Gottfried; and still the\r\nwines and dainties never ran short, and a guest could not call for a\r\nthing and not get it. To produce these effects was usual enough with\r\nwitches and enchanters--that part of it was not new; but to do it\r\nwithout any incantations, or even any rumblings or earthquakes or\r\nlightnings or apparitions--that was new, novel, wholly irregular. There\r\nwas nothing in the books like this. Enchanted things were always unreal.\r\nGold turned to dirt in an unenchanted atmosphere, food withered away and\r\nvanished. But this test failed in the present case. The spies brought\r\nsamples: Father Adolf prayed over them, exorcised them, but it did no\r\ngood; they remained sound and real, they yielded to natural decay only,\r\nand took the usual time to do it.\r\n\r\nFather Adolf was not merely puzzled, he was also exasperated; for\r\nthese evidences very nearly convinced him--privately--that there was no\r\nwitchcraft in the matter. It did not wholly convince him, for this could\r\nbe a new kind of witchcraft. There was a way to find out as to this:\r\nif this prodigal abundance of provender was not brought in from the\r\noutside, but produced on the premises, there was witchcraft, sure.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\nMarget announced a party, and invited forty people; the date for it was\r\nseven days away. This was a fine opportunity. Marget\'s house stood by\r\nitself, and it could be easily watched. All the week it was watched\r\nnight and day. Marget\'s household went out and in as usual, but they\r\ncarried nothing in their hands, and neither they nor others brought\r\nanything to the house. This was ascertained. Evidently rations for forty\r\npeople were not being fetched. If they were furnished any sustenance it\r\nwould have to be made on the premises. It was true that Marget went out\r\nwith a basket every evening, but the spies ascertained that she always\r\nbrought it back empty.\r\n\r\nThe guests arrived at noon and filled the place. Father Adolf followed;\r\nalso, after a little, the astrologer, without invitation. The spies had\r\ninformed him that neither at the back nor the front had any parcels\r\nbeen brought in. He entered, and found the eating and drinking going\r\non finely, and everything progressing in a lively and festive way. He\r\nglanced around and perceived that many of the cooked delicacies and all\r\nof the native and foreign fruits were of a perishable character, and he\r\nalso recognized that these were fresh and perfect. No apparitions, no\r\nincantations, no thunder. That settled it. This was witchcraft. And not\r\nonly that, but of a new kind--a kind never dreamed of before. It was\r\na prodigious power, an illustrious power; he resolved to discover its\r\nsecret. The announcement of it would resound throughout the world,\r\npenetrate to the remotest lands, paralyze all the nations with\r\namazement--and carry his name with it, and make him renowned forever. It\r\nwas a wonderful piece of luck, a splendid piece of luck; the glory of it\r\nmade him dizzy.\r\n\r\nAll the house made room for him; Marget politely seated him; Ursula\r\nordered Gottfried to bring a special table for him. Then she decked it\r\nand furnished it, and asked for his orders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring me what you will,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe two servants brought supplies from the pantry, together with white\r\nwine and red--a bottle of each. The astrologer, who very likely had\r\nnever seen such delicacies before, poured out a beaker of red wine,\r\ndrank it off, poured another, then began to eat with a grand appetite.\r\n\r\nI was not expecting Satan, for it was more than a week since I had\r\nseen or heard of him, but now he came in--I knew it by the feel, though\r\npeople were in the way and I could not see him. I heard him apologizing\r\nfor intruding; and he was going away, but Marget urged him to stay, and\r\nhe thanked her and stayed. She brought him along, introducing him to the\r\ngirls, and to Meidling, and to some of the elders; and there was quite\r\na rustle of whispers: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\'s the young stranger we hear so much about\r\nand can\'t get sight of, he is away so much.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear, but he is\r\nbeautiful--what is his name?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cPhilip Traum.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAh, it fits him!\xe2\x80\x9d (You\r\nsee, \xe2\x80\x9cTraum\xe2\x80\x9d is German for \xe2\x80\x9cDream.\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does he do?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cStudying for\r\nthe ministry, they say.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHis face is his fortune--he\'ll be a cardinal\r\nsome day.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is his home?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAway down somewhere in the tropics,\r\nthey say--has a rich uncle down there.\xe2\x80\x9d And so on. He made his way at\r\nonce; everybody was anxious to know him and talk with him. Everybody\r\nnoticed how cool and fresh it was, all of a sudden, and wondered at it,\r\nfor they could see that the sun was beating down the same as before,\r\noutside, and the sky was clear of clouds, but no one guessed the reason,\r\nof course.\r\n\r\nThe astrologer had drunk his second beaker; he poured out a third. He\r\nset the bottle down, and by accident overturned it. He seized it before\r\nmuch was spilled, and held it up to the light, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity--it\r\nis royal wine.\xe2\x80\x9d Then his face lighted with joy or triumph, or something,\r\nand he said, \xe2\x80\x9cQuick! Bring a bowl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was brought--a four-quart one. He took up that two-pint bottle and\r\nbegan to pour; went on pouring, the red liquor gurgling and gushing\r\ninto the white bowl and rising higher and higher up its sides, everybody\r\nstaring and holding their breath--and presently the bowl was full to the\r\nbrim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at the bottle,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, holding it up; \xe2\x80\x9cit is full yet!\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nglanced at Satan, and in that moment he vanished. Then Father Adolf rose\r\nup, flushed and excited, crossed himself, and began to thunder in his\r\ngreat voice, \xe2\x80\x9cThis house is bewitched and accursed!\xe2\x80\x9d People began to cry\r\nand shriek and crowd toward the door. \xe2\x80\x9cI summon this detected household\r\nto--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis words were cut off short. His face became red, then purple, but he\r\ncould not utter another sound. Then I saw Satan, a transparent film,\r\nmelt into the astrologer\'s body; then the astrologer put up his hand,\r\nand apparently in his own voice said, \xe2\x80\x9cWait--remain where you are.\xe2\x80\x9d All\r\nstopped where they stood. \xe2\x80\x9cBring a funnel!\xe2\x80\x9d Ursula brought it, trembling\r\nand scared, and he stuck it in the bottle and took up the great bowl\r\nand began to pour the wine back, the people gazing and dazed with\r\nastonishment, for they knew the bottle was already full before he began.\r\nHe emptied the whole of the bowl into the bottle, then smiled out over\r\nthe room, chuckled, and said, indifferently: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is nothing--anybody can\r\ndo it! With my powers I can even do much more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA frightened cry burst out everywhere. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God, he is possessed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and there was a tumultuous rush for the door which swiftly emptied the\r\nhouse of all who did not belong in it except us boys and Meidling.\r\nWe boys knew the secret, and would have told it if we could, but we\r\ncouldn\'t. We were very thankful to Satan for furnishing that good help\r\nat the needful time.\r\n\r\nMarget was pale, and crying; Meidling looked kind of petrified; Ursula\r\nthe same; but Gottfried was the worst--he couldn\'t stand, he was so weak\r\nand scared. For he was of a witch family, you know, and it would be\r\nbad for him to be suspected. Agnes came loafing in, looking pious and\r\nunaware, and wanted to rub up against Ursula and be petted, but Ursula\r\nwas afraid of her and shrank away from her, but pretending she was not\r\nmeaning any incivility, for she knew very well it wouldn\'t answer to\r\nhave strained relations with that kind of a cat. But we boys took Agnes\r\nand petted her, for Satan would not have befriended her if he had not\r\nhad a good opinion of her, and that was indorsement enough for us. He\r\nseemed to trust anything that hadn\'t the Moral Sense.\r\n\r\nOutside, the guests, panic-stricken, scattered in every direction and\r\nfled in a pitiable state of terror; and such a tumult as they made with\r\ntheir running and sobbing and shrieking and shouting that soon all the\r\nvillage came flocking from their houses to see what had happened, and\r\nthey thronged the street and shouldered and jostled one another in\r\nexcitement and fright; and then Father Adolf appeared, and they fell\r\napart in two walls like the cloven Red Sea, and presently down this lane\r\nthe astrologer came striding and mumbling, and where he passed the lanes\r\nsurged back in packed masses, and fell silent with awe, and their eyes\r\nstared and their breasts heaved, and several women fainted; and when he\r\nwas gone by the crowd swarmed together and followed him at a distance,\r\ntalking excitedly and asking questions and finding out the\r\nfacts. Finding out the facts and passing them on to others, with\r\nimprovements--improvements which soon enlarged the bowl of wine to a\r\nbarrel, and made the one bottle hold it all and yet remain empty to the\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nWhen the astrologer reached the market-square he went straight to a\r\njuggler, fantastically dressed, who was keeping three brass balls in the\r\nair, and took them from him and faced around upon the approaching crowd\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x9cThis poor clown is ignorant of his art. Come forward and see\r\nan expert perform.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he tossed the balls up one after another and set them\r\nwhirling in a slender bright oval in the air, and added another, then\r\nanother and another, and soon--no one seeing whence he got them--adding,\r\nadding, adding, the oval lengthening all the time, his hands moving so\r\nswiftly that they were just a web or a blur and not distinguishable as\r\nhands; and such as counted said there were now a hundred balls in the\r\nair. The spinning great oval reached up twenty feet in the air and was\r\na shining and glinting and wonderful sight. Then he folded his arms\r\nand told the balls to go on spinning without his help--and they did it.\r\nAfter a couple of minutes he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere, that will do,\xe2\x80\x9d and the oval\r\nbroke and came crashing down, and the balls scattered abroad and rolled\r\nevery whither. And wherever one of them came the people fell back in\r\ndread, and no one would touch it. It made him laugh, and he scoffed at\r\nthe people and called them cowards and old women. Then he turned and saw\r\nthe tight-rope, and said foolish people were daily wasting their money\r\nto see a clumsy and ignorant varlet degrade that beautiful art; now they\r\nshould see the work of a master. With that he made a spring into the air\r\nand lit firm on his feet on the rope. Then he hopped the whole length of\r\nit back and forth on one foot, with his hands clasped over his eyes; and\r\nnext he began to throw somersaults, both backward and forward, and threw\r\ntwenty-seven.\r\n\r\nThe people murmured, for the astrologer was old, and always before\r\nhad been halting of movement and at times even lame, but he was nimble\r\nenough now and went on with his antics in the liveliest manner. Finally\r\nhe sprang lightly down and walked away, and passed up the road and\r\naround the corner and disappeared. Then that great, pale, silent, solid\r\ncrowd drew a deep breath and looked into one another\'s faces as if\r\nthey said: \xe2\x80\x9cWas it real? Did you see it, or was it only I--and was I\r\ndreaming?\xe2\x80\x9d Then they broke into a low murmur of talking, and fell apart\r\nin couples, and moved toward their homes, still talking in that awed\r\nway, with faces close together and laying a hand on an arm and making\r\nother such gestures as people make when they have been deeply impressed\r\nby something.\r\n\r\nWe boys followed behind our fathers, and listened, catching all we could\r\nof what they said; and when they sat down in our house and continued\r\ntheir talk they still had us for company. They were in a sad mood, for\r\nit was certain, they said, that disaster for the village must follow\r\nthis awful visitation of witches and devils. Then my father\r\nremembered that father Adolf had been struck dumb at the moment of his\r\ndenunciation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have not ventured to lay their hands upon an anointed servant\r\nof God before,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand how they could have dared it this time I\r\ncannot make out, for he wore his crucifix. Isn\'t it so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the others, \xe2\x80\x9cwe saw it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is serious, friends, it is very serious. Always before, we had a\r\nprotection. It has failed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe others shook, as with a sort of chill, and muttered those words\r\nover--\xe2\x80\x9cIt has failed.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGod has forsaken us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seppi Wohlmeyer\'s father; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is nowhere to look\r\nfor help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe people will realize this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nikolaus\'s father, the judge, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\ndespair will take away their courage and their energies. We have indeed\r\nfallen upon evil times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sighed, and Wohlmeyer said, in a troubled voice: \xe2\x80\x9cThe report of it\r\nall will go about the country, and our village will be shunned as being\r\nunder the displeasure of God. The Golden Stag will know hard times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, neighbor,\xe2\x80\x9d said my father; \xe2\x80\x9call of us will suffer--all in repute,\r\nmany in estate. And, good God!--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat can come--to finish us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cName it--um Gottes Willen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Interdict!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt smote like a thunderclap, and they were like to swoon with the terror\r\nof it. Then the dread of this calamity roused their energies, and they\r\nstopped brooding and began to consider ways to avert it. They discussed\r\nthis, that, and the other way, and talked till the afternoon was far\r\nspent, then confessed that at present they could arrive at no decision.\r\nSo they parted sorrowfully, with oppressed hearts which were filled with\r\nbodings.\r\n\r\nWhile they were saying their parting words I slipped out and set my\r\ncourse for Marget\'s house to see what was happening there. I met many\r\npeople, but none of them greeted me. It ought to have been surprising,\r\nbut it was not, for they were so distraught with fear and dread that\r\nthey were not in their right minds, I think; they were white and\r\nhaggard, and walked like persons in a dream, their eyes open but seeing\r\nnothing, their lips moving but uttering nothing, and worriedly clasping\r\nand unclasping their hands without knowing it.\r\n\r\nAt Marget\'s it was like a funeral. She and Wilhelm sat together on the\r\nsofa, but said nothing, and not even holding hands. Both were steeped\r\nin gloom, and Marget\'s eyes were red from the crying she had been doing.\r\nShe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been begging him to go, and come no more, and so save himself\r\nalive. I cannot bear to be his murderer. This house is bewitched, and\r\nno inmate will escape the fire. But he will not go, and he will be lost\r\nwith the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilhelm said he would not go; if there was danger for her, his place was\r\nby her, and there he would remain. Then she began to cry again, and it\r\nwas all so mournful that I wished I had stayed away. There was a knock,\r\nnow, and Satan came in, fresh and cheery and beautiful, and brought that\r\nwiny atmosphere of his and changed the whole thing. He never said a\r\nword about what had been happening, nor about the awful fears which were\r\nfreezing the blood in the hearts of the community, but began to talk and\r\nrattle on about all manner of gay and pleasant things; and next about\r\nmusic--an artful stroke which cleared away the remnant of Marget\'s\r\ndepression and brought her spirits and her interests broad awake. She\r\nhad not heard any one talk so well and so knowingly on that subject\r\nbefore, and she was so uplifted by it and so charmed that what she was\r\nfeeling lit up her face and came out in her words; and Wilhelm noticed\r\nit and did not look as pleased as he ought to have done. And next Satan\r\nbranched off into poetry, and recited some, and did it well, and Marget\r\nwas charmed again; and again Wilhelm was not as pleased as he ought to\r\nhave been, and this time Marget noticed it and was remorseful.\r\n\r\nI fell asleep to pleasant music that night--the patter of rain upon the\r\npanes and the dull growling of distant thunder. Away in the night Satan\r\ncame and roused me and said: \xe2\x80\x9cCome with me. Where shall we go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnywhere--so it is with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen there was a fierce glare of sunlight, and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is China.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was a grand surprise, and made me sort of drunk with vanity and\r\ngladness to think I had come so far--so much, much farther than anybody\r\nelse in our village, including Bartel Sperling, who had such a great\r\nopinion of his travels. We buzzed around over that empire for more than\r\nhalf an hour, and saw the whole of it. It was wonderful, the spectacles\r\nwe saw; and some were beautiful, others too horrible to think. For\r\ninstance--However, I may go into that by and by, and also why Satan\r\nchose China for this excursion instead of another place; it would\r\ninterrupt my tale to do it now. Finally we stopped flitting and lit.\r\n\r\nWe sat upon a mountain commanding a vast landscape of mountain-range\r\nand gorge and valley and plain and river, with cities and villages\r\nslumbering in the sunlight, and a glimpse of blue sea on the farther\r\nverge. It was a tranquil and dreamy picture, beautiful to the eye and\r\nrestful to the spirit. If we could only make a change like that whenever\r\nwe wanted to, the world would be easier to live in than it is, for\r\nchange of scene shifts the mind\'s burdens to the other shoulder and\r\nbanishes old, shop-worn wearinesses from mind and body both.\r\n\r\nWe talked together, and I had the idea of trying to reform Satan and\r\npersuade him to lead a better life. I told him about all those things\r\nhe had been doing, and begged him to be more considerate and stop making\r\npeople unhappy. I said I knew he did not mean any harm, but that he\r\nought to stop and consider the possible consequences of a thing before\r\nlaunching it in that impulsive and random way of his; then he would\r\nnot make so much trouble. He was not hurt by this plain speech; he only\r\nlooked amused and surprised, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? I do random things? Indeed, I never do. I stop and consider\r\npossible consequences? Where is the need? I know what the consequences\r\nare going to be--always.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Satan, then how could you do these things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will tell you, and you must understand if you can. You\r\nbelong to a singular race. Every man is a suffering-machine and\r\na happiness-machine combined. The two functions work together\r\nharmoniously, with a fine and delicate precision, on the give-and-take\r\nprinciple. For every happiness turned out in the one department the\r\nother stands ready to modify it with a sorrow or a pain--maybe a dozen.\r\nIn most cases the man\'s life is about equally divided between\r\nhappiness and unhappiness. When this is not the case the unhappiness\r\npredominates--always; never the other. Sometimes a man\'s make and\r\ndisposition are such that his misery-machine is able to do nearly all\r\nthe business. Such a man goes through life almost ignorant of what\r\nhappiness is. Everything he touches, everything he does, brings a\r\nmisfortune upon him. You have seen such people? To that kind of a person\r\nlife is not an advantage, is it? It is only a disaster. Sometimes for an\r\nhour\'s happiness a man\'s machinery makes him pay years of misery. Don\'t\r\nyou know that? It happens every now and then. I will give you a case\r\nor two presently. Now the people of your village are nothing to me--you\r\nknow that, don\'t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not like to speak out too flatly, so I said I had suspected it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is true that they are nothing to me. It is not possible\r\nthat they should be. The difference between them and me is abysmal,\r\nimmeasurable. They have no intellect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo intellect?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing that resembles it. At a future time I will examine what man\r\ncalls his mind and give you the details of that chaos, then you will see\r\nand understand. Men have nothing in common with me--there is no point of\r\ncontact; they have foolish little feelings and foolish little vanities\r\nand impertinences and ambitions; their foolish little life is but a\r\nlaugh, a sigh, and extinction; and they have no sense. Only the Moral\r\nSense. I will show you what I mean. Here is a red spider, not so big\r\nas a pin\'s head. Can you imagine an elephant being interested in\r\nhim--caring whether he is happy or isn\'t, or whether he is wealthy or\r\npoor, or whether his sweetheart returns his love or not, or whether his\r\nmother is sick or well, or whether he is looked up to in society or\r\nnot, or whether his enemies will smite him or his friends desert him, or\r\nwhether his hopes will suffer blight or his political ambitions fail,\r\nor whether he shall die in the bosom of his family or neglected and\r\ndespised in a foreign land? These things can never be important to the\r\nelephant; they are nothing to him; he cannot shrink his sympathies to\r\nthe microscopic size of them. Man is to me as the red spider is to the\r\nelephant. The elephant has nothing against the spider--he cannot get\r\ndown to that remote level; I have nothing against man. The elephant is\r\nindifferent; I am indifferent. The elephant would not take the trouble\r\nto do the spider an ill turn; if he took the notion he might do him a\r\ngood turn, if it came in his way and cost nothing. I have done men good\r\nservice, but no ill turns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe elephant lives a century, the red spider a day; in power,\r\nintellect, and dignity the one creature is separated from the other by\r\na distance which is simply astronomical. Yet in these, as in all\r\nqualities, man is immeasurably further below me than is the wee spider\r\nbelow the elephant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMan\'s mind clumsily and tediously and laboriously patches little\r\ntrivialities together and gets a result--such as it is. My mind creates!\r\nDo you get the force of that? Creates anything it desires--and in\r\na moment. Creates without material. Creates fluids, solids,\r\ncolors--anything, everything--out of the airy nothing which is called\r\nThought. A man imagines a silk thread, imagines a machine to make it,\r\nimagines a picture, then by weeks of labor embroiders it on canvas\r\nwith the thread. I think the whole thing, and in a moment it is before\r\nyou--created.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think a poem, music, the record of a game of chess--anything--and\r\nit is there. This is the immortal mind--nothing is beyond its reach.\r\nNothing can obstruct my vision; the rocks are transparent to me, and\r\ndarkness is daylight. I do not need to open a book; I take the whole of\r\nits contents into my mind at a single glance, through the cover; and in\r\na million years I could not forget a single word of it, or its place in\r\nthe volume. Nothing goes on in the skull of man, bird, fish, insect, or\r\nother creature which can be hidden from me. I pierce the learned man\'s\r\nbrain with a single glance, and the treasures which cost him threescore\r\nyears to accumulate are mine; he can forget, and he does forget, but I\r\nretain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, then, I perceive by your thoughts that you are understanding me\r\nfairly well. Let us proceed. Circumstances might so fall out that the\r\nelephant could like the spider--supposing he can see it--but he could\r\nnot love it. His love is for his own kind--for his equals. An\r\nangel\'s love is sublime, adorable, divine, beyond the imagination of\r\nman--infinitely beyond it! But it is limited to his own august order. If\r\nit fell upon one of your race for only an instant, it would consume\r\nits object to ashes. No, we cannot love men, but we can be harmlessly\r\nindifferent to them; we can also like them, sometimes. I like you and\r\nthe boys, I like father Peter, and for your sakes I am doing all these\r\nthings for the villagers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe saw that I was thinking a sarcasm, and he explained his position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have wrought well for the villagers, though it does not look like\r\nit on the surface. Your race never know good fortune from ill. They are\r\nalways mistaking the one for the other. It is because they cannot see\r\ninto the future. What I am doing for the villagers will bear good fruit\r\nsome day; in some cases to themselves; in others, to unborn generations\r\nof men. No one will ever know that I was the cause, but it will be none\r\nthe less true, for all that. Among you boys you have a game: you stand a\r\nrow of bricks on end a few inches apart; you push a brick, it knocks its\r\nneighbor over, the neighbor knocks over the next brick--and so on till\r\nall the row is prostrate. That is human life. A child\'s first act knocks\r\nover the initial brick, and the rest will follow inexorably. If you\r\ncould see into the future, as I can, you would see everything that was\r\ngoing to happen to that creature; for nothing can change the order of\r\nits life after the first event has determined it. That is, nothing will\r\nchange it, because each act unfailingly begets an act, that act begets\r\nanother, and so on to the end, and the seer can look forward down the\r\nline and see just when each act is to have birth, from cradle to grave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes God order the career?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForeordain it? No. The man\'s circumstances and environment order it.\r\nHis first act determines the second and all that follow after. But\r\nsuppose, for argument\'s sake, that the man should skip one of these\r\nacts; an apparently trifling one, for instance; suppose that it had been\r\nappointed that on a certain day, at a certain hour and minute and second\r\nand fraction of a second he should go to the well, and he didn\'t go.\r\nThat man\'s career would change utterly, from that moment; thence to the\r\ngrave it would be wholly different from the career which his first act\r\nas a child had arranged for him. Indeed, it might be that if he had\r\ngone to the well he would have ended his career on a throne, and that\r\nomitting to do it would set him upon a career that would lead to\r\nbeggary and a pauper\'s grave. For instance: if at any time--say in\r\nboyhood--Columbus had skipped the triflingest little link in the chain\r\nof acts projected and made inevitable by his first childish act, it\r\nwould have changed his whole subsequent life, and he would have become\r\na priest and died obscure in an Italian village, and America would not\r\nhave been discovered for two centuries afterward. I know this. To\r\nskip any one of the billion acts in Columbus\'s chain would have wholly\r\nchanged his life. I have examined his billion of possible careers, and\r\nin only one of them occurs the discovery of America. You people do not\r\nsuspect that all of your acts are of one size and importance, but it is\r\ntrue; to snatch at an appointed fly is as big with fate for you as is\r\nany other appointed act--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs the conquering of a continent, for instance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Now, then, no man ever does drop a link--the thing has never\r\nhappened! Even when he is trying to make up his mind as to whether\r\nhe will do a thing or not, that itself is a link, an act, and has its\r\nproper place in his chain; and when he finally decides an act, that also\r\nwas the thing which he was absolutely certain to do. You see, now, that\r\na man will never drop a link in his chain. He cannot. If he made up his\r\nmind to try, that project would itself be an unavoidable link--a thought\r\nbound to occur to him at that precise moment, and made certain by the\r\nfirst act of his babyhood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed so dismal!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a prisoner for life,\xe2\x80\x9d I said sorrowfully, \xe2\x80\x9cand cannot get free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, of himself he cannot get away from the consequences of his first\r\nchildish act. But I can free him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked up wistfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have changed the careers of a number of your villagers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI tried to thank him, but found it difficult, and let it drop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall make some other changes. You know that little Lisa Brandt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, everybody does. My mother says she is so sweet and so lovely\r\nthat she is not like any other child. She says she will be the pride of\r\nthe village when she grows up; and its idol, too, just as she is now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall change her future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake it better?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. And I will change the future of Nikolaus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was glad, this time, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\'t need to ask about his case;\r\nyou will be sure to do generously by him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my intention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStraight off I was building that great future of Nicky\'s in my\r\nimagination, and had already made a renowned general of him and\r\nhofmeister at the court, when I noticed that Satan was waiting for me\r\nto get ready to listen again. I was ashamed of having exposed my cheap\r\nimaginings to him, and was expecting some sarcasms, but it did not\r\nhappen. He proceeded with his subject:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNicky\'s appointed life is sixty-two years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\'s grand!\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLisa\'s, thirty-six. But, as I told you, I shall change their lives and\r\nthose ages. Two minutes and a quarter from now Nikolaus will wake out of\r\nhis sleep and find the rain blowing in. It was appointed that he should\r\nturn over and go to sleep again. But I have appointed that he shall\r\nget up and close the window first. That trifle will change his career\r\nentirely. He will rise in the morning two minutes later than the chain\r\nof his life had appointed him to rise. By consequence, thenceforth\r\nnothing will ever happen to him in accordance with the details of the\r\nold chain.\xe2\x80\x9d He took out his watch and sat looking at it a few moments,\r\nthen said: \xe2\x80\x9cNikolaus has risen to close the window. His life is changed,\r\nhis new career has begun. There will be consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt made me feel creepy; it was uncanny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut for this change certain things would happen twelve days from now.\r\nFor instance, Nikolaus would save Lisa from drowning. He would arrive\r\non the scene at exactly the right moment--four minutes past ten, the\r\nlong-ago appointed instant of time--and the water would be shoal, the\r\nachievement easy and certain. But he will arrive some seconds too late,\r\nnow; Lisa will have struggled into deeper water. He will do his best,\r\nbut both will drown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Satan! Oh, dear Satan!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, with the tears rising in my eyes,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csave them! Don\'t let it happen. I can\'t bear to lose Nikolaus, he is my\r\nloving playmate and friend; and think of Lisa\'s poor mother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI clung to him and begged and pleaded, but he was not moved. He made me\r\nsit down again, and told me I must hear him out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have changed Nikolaus\'s life, and this has changed Lisa\'s. If I had\r\nnot done this, Nikolaus would save Lisa, then he would catch cold from\r\nhis drenching; one of your race\'s fantastic and desolating scarlet\r\nfevers would follow, with pathetic after-effects; for forty-six years\r\nhe would lie in his bed a paralytic log, deaf, dumb, blind, and praying\r\nnight and day for the blessed relief of death. Shall I change his life\r\nback?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no! Oh, not for the world! In charity and pity leave it as it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is best so. I could not have changed any other link in his life and\r\ndone him so good a service. He had a billion possible careers, but not\r\none of them was worth living; they were charged full with miseries and\r\ndisasters. But for my intervention he would do his brave deed twelve\r\ndays from now--a deed begun and ended in six minutes--and get for all\r\nreward those forty-six years of sorrow and suffering I told you of.\r\nIt is one of the cases I was thinking of awhile ago when I said\r\nthat sometimes an act which brings the actor an hour\'s happiness and\r\nself-satisfaction is paid for--or punished--by years of suffering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI wondered what poor little Lisa\'s early death would save her from. He\r\nanswered the thought:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom ten years of pain and slow recovery from an accident, and then\r\nfrom nineteen years\' pollution, shame, depravity, crime, ending with\r\ndeath at the hands of the executioner. Twelve days hence she will die;\r\nher mother would save her life if she could. Am I not kinder than her\r\nmother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--oh, indeed yes; and wiser.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather Peter\'s case is coming on presently. He will be acquitted,\r\nthrough unassailable proofs of his innocence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Satan, how can that be? Do you really think it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I know it. His good name will be restored, and the rest of his\r\nlife will be happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can believe it. To restore his good name will have that effect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis happiness will not proceed from that cause. I shall change his\r\nlife that day, for his good. He will never know his good name has been\r\nrestored.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn my mind--and modestly--I asked for particulars, but Satan paid no\r\nattention to my thought. Next, my mind wandered to the astrologer, and I\r\nwondered where he might be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the moon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Satan, with a fleeting sound which I believed was\r\na chuckle. \xe2\x80\x9cI\'ve got him on the cold side of it, too. He doesn\'t know\r\nwhere he is, and is not having a pleasant time; still, it is good enough\r\nfor him, a good place for his star studies. I shall need him presently;\r\nthen I shall bring him back and possess him again. He has a long and\r\ncruel and odious life before him, but I will change that, for I have no\r\nfeeling against him and am quite willing to do him a kindness. I think I\r\nshall get him burned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had such strange notions of kindness! But angels are made so, and\r\ndo not know any better. Their ways are not like our ways; and, besides,\r\nhuman beings are nothing to them; they think they are only freaks. It\r\nseems to me odd that he should put the astrologer so far away; he could\r\nhave dumped him in Germany just as well, where he would be handy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFar away?\xe2\x80\x9d said Satan. \xe2\x80\x9cTo me no place is far away; distance does not\r\nexist for me. The sun is less than a hundred million miles from here,\r\nand the light that is falling upon us has taken eight minutes to come;\r\nbut I can make that flight, or any other, in a fraction of time so\r\nminute that it cannot be measured by a watch. I have but to think the\r\njourney, and it is accomplished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI held out my hand and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe light lies upon it; think it into a\r\nglass of wine, Satan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did it. I drank the wine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBreak the glass,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nI broke it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere--you see it is real. The villagers thought the brass balls were\r\nmagic stuff and as perishable as smoke. They were afraid to touch them.\r\nYou are a curious lot--your race. But come along; I have business. I\r\nwill put you to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d Said and done. Then he was gone; but his voice\r\ncame back to me through the rain and darkness saying, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, tell Seppi,\r\nbut no other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the answer to my thought.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8\r\n\r\nSleep would not come. It was not because I was proud of my travels and\r\nexcited about having been around the big world to China, and feeling\r\ncontemptuous of Bartel Sperling, \xe2\x80\x9cthe traveler,\xe2\x80\x9d as he called himself,\r\nand looked down upon us others because he had been to Vienna once and\r\nwas the only Eseldorf boy who had made such a journey and seen the\r\nworld\'s wonders. At another time that would have kept me awake, but it\r\ndid not affect me now. No, my mind was filled with Nikolaus, my thoughts\r\nran upon him only, and the good days we had seen together at romps and\r\nfrolics in the woods and the fields and the river in the long summer\r\ndays, and skating and sliding in the winter when our parents thought\r\nwe were in school. And now he was going out of this young life, and the\r\nsummers and winters would come and go, and we others would rove and play\r\nas before, but his place would be vacant; we should see him no more.\r\nTo-morrow he would not suspect, but would be as he had always been,\r\nand it would shock me to hear him laugh, and see him do lightsome and\r\nfrivolous things, for to me he would be a corpse, with waxen hands and\r\ndull eyes, and I should see the shroud around his face; and next day he\r\nwould not suspect, nor the next, and all the time his handful of days\r\nwould be wasting swiftly away and that awful thing coming nearer and\r\nnearer, his fate closing steadily around him and no one knowing it but\r\nSeppi and me. Twelve days--only twelve days. It was awful to think of. I\r\nnoticed that in my thoughts I was not calling him by his familiar\r\nnames, Nick and Nicky, but was speaking of him by his full name, and\r\nreverently, as one speaks of the dead. Also, as incident after incident\r\nof our comradeship came thronging into my mind out of the past, I\r\nnoticed that they were mainly cases where I had wronged him or hurt\r\nhim, and they rebuked me and reproached me, and my heart was wrung with\r\nremorse, just as it is when we remember our unkindnesses to friends who\r\nhave passed beyond the veil, and we wish we could have them back again,\r\nif only for a moment, so that we could go on our knees to them and say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave pity, and forgive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce when we were nine years old he went a long errand of nearly two\r\nmiles for the fruiterer, who gave him a splendid big apple for reward,\r\nand he was flying home with it, almost beside himself with astonishment\r\nand delight, and I met him, and he let me look at the apple, not\r\nthinking of treachery, and I ran off with it, eating it as I ran, he\r\nfollowing me and begging; and when he overtook me I offered him the\r\ncore, which was all that was left; and I laughed. Then he turned away,\r\ncrying, and said he had meant to give it to his little sister. That\r\nsmote me, for she was slowly getting well of a sickness, and it would\r\nhave been a proud moment for him, to see her joy and surprise and have\r\nher caresses. But I was ashamed to say I was ashamed, and only said\r\nsomething rude and mean, to pretend I did not care, and he made no reply\r\nin words, but there was a wounded look in his face as he turned away\r\ntoward his home which rose before me many times in after years, in the\r\nnight, and reproached me and made me ashamed again. It had grown dim in\r\nmy mind, by and by, then it disappeared; but it was back now, and not\r\ndim.\r\n\r\nOnce at school, when we were eleven, I upset my ink and spoiled four\r\ncopy-books, and was in danger of severe punishment; but I put it upon\r\nhim, and he got the whipping.\r\n\r\nAnd only last year I had cheated him in a trade, giving him a large\r\nfish-hook which was partly broken through for three small sound ones.\r\nThe first fish he caught broke the hook, but he did not know I was\r\nblamable, and he refused to take back one of the small hooks which my\r\nconscience forced me to offer him, but said, \xe2\x80\x9cA trade is a trade; the\r\nhook was bad, but that was not your fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo, I could not sleep. These little, shabby wrongs upbraided me and\r\ntortured me, and with a pain much sharper than one feels when the wrongs\r\nhave been done to the living. Nikolaus was living, but no matter; he was\r\nto me as one already dead. The wind was still moaning about the eaves,\r\nthe rain still pattering upon the panes.\r\n\r\nIn the morning I sought out Seppi and told him. It was down by the\r\nriver. His lips moved, but he did not say anything, he only looked dazed\r\nand stunned, and his face turned very white. He stood like that a few\r\nmoments, the tears welling into his eyes, then he turned away and I\r\nlocked my arm in his and we walked along thinking, but not speaking.\r\nWe crossed the bridge and wandered through the meadows and up among the\r\nhills and the woods, and at last the talk came and flowed freely, and it\r\nwas all about Nikolaus and was a recalling of the life we had lived with\r\nhim. And every now and then Seppi said, as if to himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwelve days!--less than twelve days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe said we must be with him all the time; we must have all of him we\r\ncould; the days were precious now. Yet we did not go to seek him. It\r\nwould be like meeting the dead, and we were afraid. We did not say it,\r\nbut that was what we were feeling. And so it gave us a shock when we\r\nturned a curve and came upon Nikolaus face to face. He shouted, gaily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi-hi! What is the matter? Have you seen a ghost?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe couldn\'t speak, but there was no occasion; he was willing to talk\r\nfor us all, for he had just seen Satan and was in high spirits about it.\r\nSatan had told him about our trip to China, and he had begged Satan to\r\ntake him a journey, and Satan had promised. It was to be a far journey,\r\nand wonderful and beautiful; and Nikolaus had begged him to take us,\r\ntoo, but he said no, he would take us some day, maybe, but not now.\r\nSatan would come for him on the 13th, and Nikolaus was already counting\r\nthe hours, he was so impatient.\r\n\r\nThat was the fatal day. We were already counting the hours, too.\r\n\r\nWe wandered many a mile, always following paths which had been our\r\nfavorites from the days when we were little, and always we talked about\r\nthe old times. All the blitheness was with Nikolaus; we others could\r\nnot shake off our depression. Our tone toward Nikolaus was so strangely\r\ngentle and tender and yearning that he noticed it, and was pleased; and\r\nwe were constantly doing him deferential little offices of courtesy,\r\nand saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWait, let me do that for you,\xe2\x80\x9d and that pleased him, too. I\r\ngave him seven fish-hooks--all I had--and made him take them; and\r\nSeppi gave him his new knife and a humming-top painted red and\r\nyellow--atonements for swindles practised upon him formerly, as I\r\nlearned later, and probably no longer remembered by Nikolaus now. These\r\nthings touched him, and he could not have believed that we loved him so;\r\nand his pride in it and gratefulness for it cut us to the heart, we were\r\nso undeserving of them. When we parted at last, he was radiant, and said\r\nhe had never had such a happy day.\r\n\r\nAs we walked along homeward, Seppi said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe always prized him, but\r\nnever so much as now, when we are going to lose him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNext day and every day we spent all of our spare time with Nikolaus;\r\nand also added to it time which we (and he) stole from work and other\r\nduties, and this cost the three of us some sharp scoldings, and some\r\nthreats of punishment. Every morning two of us woke with a start and\r\na shudder, saying, as the days flew along, \xe2\x80\x9cOnly ten days left;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9conly\r\nnine days left;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9conly eight;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9conly seven.\xe2\x80\x9d Always it was narrowing.\r\nAlways Nikolaus was gay and happy, and always puzzled because we were\r\nnot. He wore his invention to the bone trying to invent ways to cheer us\r\nup, but it was only a hollow success; he could see that our jollity had\r\nno heart in it, and that the laughs we broke into came up against some\r\nobstruction or other and suffered damage and decayed into a sigh. He\r\ntried to find out what the matter was, so that he could help us out of\r\nour trouble or make it lighter by sharing it with us; so we had to tell\r\nmany lies to deceive him and appease him.\r\n\r\nBut the most distressing thing of all was that he was always making\r\nplans, and often they went beyond the 13th! Whenever that happened it\r\nmade us groan in spirit. All his mind was fixed upon finding some way\r\nto conquer our depression and cheer us up; and at last, when he had but\r\nthree days to live, he fell upon the right idea and was jubilant over\r\nit--a boys-and-girls\' frolic and dance in the woods, up there where we\r\nfirst met Satan, and this was to occur on the 14th. It was ghastly, for\r\nthat was his funeral day. We couldn\'t venture to protest; it would only\r\nhave brought a \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d which we could not answer. He wanted us to help\r\nhim invite his guests, and we did it--one can refuse nothing to a dying\r\nfriend. But it was dreadful, for really we were inviting them to his\r\nfuneral.\r\n\r\nIt was an awful eleven days; and yet, with a lifetime stretching back\r\nbetween to-day and then, they are still a grateful memory to me, and\r\nbeautiful. In effect they were days of companionship with one\'s sacred\r\ndead, and I have known no comradeship that was so close or so precious.\r\nWe clung to the hours and the minutes, counting them as they wasted\r\naway, and parting with them with that pain and bereavement which a miser\r\nfeels who sees his hoard filched from him coin by coin by robbers and is\r\nhelpless to prevent it.\r\n\r\nWhen the evening of the last day came we stayed out too long; Seppi and\r\nI were in fault for that; we could not bear to part with Nikolaus; so\r\nit was very late when we left him at his door. We lingered near awhile,\r\nlistening; and that happened which we were fearing. His father gave him\r\nthe promised punishment, and we heard his shrieks. But we listened only\r\na moment, then hurried away, remorseful for this thing which we had\r\ncaused. And sorry for the father, too; our thought being, \xe2\x80\x9cIf he only\r\nknew--if he only knew!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the morning Nikolaus did not meet us at the appointed place, so we\r\nwent to his home to see what the matter was. His mother said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis father is out of all patience with these goings-on, and will not\r\nhave any more of it. Half the time when Nick is needed he is not to be\r\nfound; then it turns out that he has been gadding around with you two.\r\nHis father gave him a flogging last night. It always grieved me before,\r\nand many\'s the time I have begged him off and saved him, but this time\r\nhe appealed to me in vain, for I was out of patience myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you had saved him just this one time,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, my voice\r\ntrembling a little; \xe2\x80\x9cit would ease a pain in your heart to remember it\r\nsome day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was ironing at the time, and her back was partly toward me. She\r\nturned about with a startled or wondering look in her face and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was not prepared, and didn\'t know anything to say; so it was awkward,\r\nfor she kept looking at me; but Seppi was alert and spoke up:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course it would be pleasant to remember, for the very reason\r\nwe were out so late was that Nikolaus got to telling how good you are to\r\nhim, and how he never got whipped when you were by to save him; and he\r\nwas so full of it, and we were so full of the interest of it, that none\r\nof us noticed how late it was getting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he say that? Did he?\xe2\x80\x9d and she put her apron to her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can ask Theodor--he will tell you the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a dear, good lad, my Nick,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry I let him get\r\nwhipped; I will never do it again. To think--all the time I was sitting\r\nhere last night, fretting and angry at him, he was loving me and\r\npraising me! Dear, dear, if we could only know! Then we shouldn\'t ever\r\ngo wrong; but we are only poor, dumb beasts groping around and making\r\nmistakes. I shan\'t ever think of last night without a pang.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was like all the rest; it seemed as if nobody could open a mouth, in\r\nthese wretched days, without saying something that made us shiver. They\r\nwere \xe2\x80\x9cgroping around,\xe2\x80\x9d and did not know what true, sorrowfully true\r\nthings they were saying by accident.\r\n\r\nSeppi asked if Nikolaus might go out with us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he can\'t. To punish him further, his\r\nfather doesn\'t allow him to go out of the house to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe had a great hope! I saw it in Seppi\'s eyes. We thought, \xe2\x80\x9cIf he cannot\r\nleave the house, he cannot be drowned.\xe2\x80\x9d Seppi asked, to make sure:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust he stay in all day, or only the morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll day. It\'s such a pity, too; it\'s a beautiful day, and he is so\r\nunused to being shut up. But he is busy planning his party, and maybe\r\nthat is company for him. I do hope he isn\'t too lonesome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeppi saw that in her eye which emboldened him to ask if we might go up\r\nand help him pass his time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd welcome!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, right heartily. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I call that real\r\nfriendship, when you might be abroad in the fields and the woods, having\r\na happy time. You are good boys, I\'ll allow that, though you don\'t\r\nalways find satisfactory ways of improving it. Take these cakes--for\r\nyourselves--and give him this one, from his mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe first thing we noticed when we entered Nikolaus\'s room was the\r\ntime--a quarter to 10. Could that be correct? Only such a few minutes to\r\nlive! I felt a contraction at my heart. Nikolaus jumped up and gave us\r\na glad welcome. He was in good spirits over his plannings for his party\r\nand had not been lonesome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand look at what I\'ve been doing. And I\'ve\r\nfinished a kite that you will say is a beauty. It\'s drying, in the\r\nkitchen; I\'ll fetch it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had been spending his penny savings in fanciful trifles of various\r\nkinds, to go as prizes in the games, and they were marshaled with fine\r\nand showy effect upon the table. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExamine them at your leisure while I get mother to touch up the kite\r\nwith her iron if it isn\'t dry enough yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he tripped out and went clattering down-stairs, whistling.\r\n\r\nWe did not look at the things; we couldn\'t take any interest in anything\r\nbut the clock. We sat staring at it in silence, listening to\r\nthe ticking, and every time the minute-hand jumped we nodded\r\nrecognition--one minute fewer to cover in the race for life or for\r\ndeath. Finally Seppi drew a deep breath and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo minutes to ten. Seven minutes more and he will pass the\r\ndeath-point. Theodor, he is going to be saved! He\'s going to--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! I\'m on needles. Watch the clock and keep still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFive minutes more. We were panting with the strain and the excitement.\r\nAnother three minutes, and there was a footstep on the stair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaved!\xe2\x80\x9d And we jumped up and faced the door.\r\n\r\nThe old mother entered, bringing the kite. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\'t it a beauty?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, dear me, how he has slaved over it--ever since daylight,\r\nI think, and only finished it awhile before you came.\xe2\x80\x9d She stood it\r\nagainst the wall, and stepped back to take a view of it. \xe2\x80\x9cHe drew the\r\npictures his own self, and I think they are very good. The church isn\'t\r\nso very good, I\'ll have to admit, but look at the bridge--any one can\r\nrecognize the bridge in a minute. He asked me to bring it up.... Dear\r\nme! it\'s seven minutes past ten, and I--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe? Oh, he\'ll be here soon; he\'s gone out a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Just as he came down-stairs little Lisa\'s mother came in and said\r\nthe child had wandered off somewhere, and as she was a little uneasy I\r\ntold Nikolaus to never mind about his father\'s orders--go and look her\r\nup.... Why, how white you two do look! I do believe you are sick. Sit\r\ndown; I\'ll fetch something. That cake has disagreed with you. It is a\r\nlittle heavy, but I thought--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe disappeared without finishing her sentence, and we hurried at once\r\nto the back window and looked toward the river. There was a great crowd\r\nat the other end of the bridge, and people were flying toward that point\r\nfrom every direction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is all over--poor Nikolaus! Why, oh, why did she let him get out\r\nof the house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seppi, half sobbing, \xe2\x80\x9ccome quick--we can\'t bear to\r\nmeet her; in five minutes she will know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut we were not to escape. She came upon us at the foot of the stairs,\r\nwith her cordials in her hands, and made us come in and sit down and\r\ntake the medicine. Then she watched the effect, and it did not satisfy\r\nher; so she made us wait longer, and kept upbraiding herself for giving\r\nus the unwholesome cake.\r\n\r\nPresently the thing happened which we were dreading. There was a sound\r\nof tramping and scraping outside, and a crowd came solemnly in, with\r\nheads uncovered, and laid the two drowned bodies on the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d that poor mother cried out, and fell on her knees, and put\r\nher arms about her dead boy and began to cover the wet face with kisses.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it was I that sent him, and I have been his death. If I had obeyed,\r\nand kept him in the house, this would not have happened. And I am\r\nrightly punished; I was cruel to him last night, and him begging me, his\r\nown mother, to be his friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so she went on and on, and all the women cried, and pitied her, and\r\ntried to comfort her, but she could not forgive herself and could not\r\nbe comforted, and kept on saying if she had not sent him out he would be\r\nalive and well now, and she was the cause of his death.\r\n\r\nIt shows how foolish people are when they blame themselves for anything\r\nthey have done. Satan knows, and he said nothing happens that your first\r\nact hasn\'t arranged to happen and made inevitable; and so, of your own\r\nmotion you can\'t ever alter the scheme or do a thing that will break\r\na link. Next we heard screams, and Frau Brandt came wildly plowing and\r\nplunging through the crowd with her dress in disorder and hair flying\r\nloose, and flung herself upon her dead child with moans and kisses and\r\npleadings and endearments; and by and by she rose up almost exhausted\r\nwith her outpourings of passionate emotion, and clenched her fist and\r\nlifted it toward the sky, and her tear-drenched face grew hard and\r\nresentful, and she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor nearly two weeks I have had dreams and presentiments and warnings\r\nthat death was going to strike what was most precious to me, and day and\r\nnight and night and day I have groveled in the dirt before Him praying\r\nHim to have pity on my innocent child and save it from harm--and here is\r\nHis answer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhy, He had saved it from harm--but she did not know.\r\n\r\nShe wiped the tears from her eyes and cheeks, and stood awhile gazing\r\ndown at the child and caressing its face and its hair with her hands;\r\nthen she spoke again in that bitter tone: \xe2\x80\x9cBut in His hard heart is no\r\ncompassion. I will never pray again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gathered her dead child to her bosom and strode away, the crowd\r\nfalling back to let her pass, and smitten dumb by the awful words they\r\nhad heard. Ah, that poor woman! It is as Satan said, we do not know good\r\nfortune from bad, and are always mistaking the one for the other. Many\r\na time since I have heard people pray to God to spare the life of sick\r\npersons, but I have never done it.\r\n\r\nBoth funerals took place at the same time in our little church next day.\r\nEverybody was there, including the party guests. Satan was there, too;\r\nwhich was proper, for it was on account of his efforts that the funerals\r\nhad happened. Nikolaus had departed this life without absolution, and\r\na collection was taken up for masses, to get him out of purgatory. Only\r\ntwo-thirds of the required money was gathered, and the parents were\r\ngoing to try to borrow the rest, but Satan furnished it. He told us\r\nprivately that there was no purgatory, but he had contributed in order\r\nthat Nikolaus\'s parents and their friends might be saved from worry and\r\ndistress. We thought it very good of him, but he said money did not cost\r\nhim anything.\r\n\r\nAt the graveyard the body of little Lisa was seized for debt by a\r\ncarpenter to whom the mother owed fifty groschen for work done the year\r\nbefore. She had never been able to pay this, and was not able now. The\r\ncarpenter took the corpse home and kept it four days in his cellar,\r\nthe mother weeping and imploring about his house all the time; then he\r\nburied it in his brother\'s cattle-yard, without religious ceremonies. It\r\ndrove the mother wild with grief and shame, and she forsook her work\r\nand went daily about the town, cursing the carpenter and blaspheming\r\nthe laws of the emperor and the church, and it was pitiful to see. Seppi\r\nasked Satan to interfere, but he said the carpenter and the rest were\r\nmembers of the human race and were acting quite neatly for that species\r\nof animal. He would interfere if he found a horse acting in such a way,\r\nand we must inform him when we came across that kind of horse doing\r\nthat kind of human thing, so that he could stop it. We believed this was\r\nsarcasm, for of course there wasn\'t any such horse.\r\n\r\nBut after a few days we found that we could not abide that poor woman\'s\r\ndistress, so we begged Satan to examine her several possible careers,\r\nand see if he could not change her, to her profit, to a new one. He said\r\nthe longest of her careers as they now stood gave her forty-two years to\r\nlive, and her shortest one twenty-nine, and that both were charged with\r\ngrief and hunger and cold and pain. The only improvement he could make\r\nwould be to enable her to skip a certain three minutes from now; and\r\nhe asked us if he should do it. This was such a short time to decide in\r\nthat we went to pieces with nervous excitement, and before we could pull\r\nourselves together and ask for particulars he said the time would be up\r\nin a few more seconds; so then we gasped out, \xe2\x80\x9cDo it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is done,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cshe was going around a corner; I have turned her\r\nback; it has changed her career.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what will happen, Satan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is happening now. She is having words with Fischer, the weaver. In\r\nhis anger Fischer will straightway do what he would not have done but\r\nfor this accident. He was present when she stood over her child\'s body\r\nand uttered those blasphemies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will he do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is doing it now--betraying her. In three days she will go to the\r\nstake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe could not speak; we were frozen with horror, for if we had not\r\nmeddled with her career she would have been spared this awful fate.\r\nSatan noticed these thoughts, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you are thinking is strictly human-like--that is to say, foolish.\r\nThe woman is advantaged. Die when she might, she would go to heaven. By\r\nthis prompt death she gets twenty-nine years more of heaven than she is\r\nentitled to, and escapes twenty-nine years of misery here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA moment before we were bitterly making up our minds that we would ask\r\nno more favors of Satan for friends of ours, for he did not seem to\r\nknow any way to do a person a kindness but by killing him; but the whole\r\naspect of the case was changed now, and we were glad of what we had done\r\nand full of happiness in the thought of it.\r\n\r\nAfter a little I began to feel troubled about Fischer, and asked,\r\ntimidly, \xe2\x80\x9cDoes this episode change Fischer\'s life-scheme, Satan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChange it? Why, certainly. And radically. If he had not met Frau Brandt\r\nawhile ago he would die next year, thirty-four years of age. Now he will\r\nlive to be ninety, and have a pretty prosperous and comfortable life of\r\nit, as human lives go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe felt a great joy and pride in what we had done for Fischer, and were\r\nexpecting Satan to sympathize with this feeling; but he showed no sign\r\nand this made us uneasy. We waited for him to speak, but he didn\'t; so,\r\nto assuage our solicitude we had to ask him if there was any defect in\r\nFischer\'s good luck. Satan considered the question a moment, then said,\r\nwith some hesitation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the fact is, it is a delicate point. Under his several former\r\npossible life-careers he was going to heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were aghast. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Satan! and under this one--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, don\'t be so distressed. You were sincerely trying to do him a\r\nkindness; let that comfort you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear, dear, that cannot comfort us. You ought to have told us what\r\nwe were doing, then we wouldn\'t have acted so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it made no impression on him. He had never felt a pain or a sorrow,\r\nand did not know what they were, in any really informing way. He had no\r\nknowledge of them except theoretically--that is to say, intellectually.\r\nAnd of course that is no good. One can never get any but a loose and\r\nignorant notion of such things except by experience. We tried our best\r\nto make him comprehend the awful thing that had been done and how we\r\nwere compromised by it, but he couldn\'t seem to get hold of it. He said\r\nhe did not think it important where Fischer went to; in heaven he would\r\nnot be missed, there were \xe2\x80\x9cplenty there.\xe2\x80\x9d We tried to make him see that\r\nhe was missing the point entirely; that Fischer, and not other people,\r\nwas the proper one to decide about the importance of it; but it all went\r\nfor nothing; he said he did not care for Fischer--there were plenty more\r\nFischers.\r\n\r\nThe next minute Fischer went by on the other side of the way, and it\r\nmade us sick and faint to see him, remembering the doom that was upon\r\nhim, and we the cause of it. And how unconscious he was that anything\r\nhad happened to him! You could see by his elastic step and his alert\r\nmanner that he was well satisfied with himself for doing that hard\r\nturn for poor Frau Brandt. He kept glancing back over his shoulder\r\nexpectantly. And, sure enough, pretty soon Frau Brandt followed after,\r\nin charge of the officers and wearing jingling chains. A mob was in her\r\nwake, jeering and shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cBlasphemer and heretic!\xe2\x80\x9d and some among\r\nthem were neighbors and friends of her happier days. Some were trying\r\nto strike her, and the officers were not taking as much trouble as they\r\nmight to keep them from it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, stop them, Satan!\xe2\x80\x9d It was out before we remembered that he\r\ncould not interrupt them for a moment without changing their whole\r\nafter-lives. He puffed a little puff toward them with his lips and they\r\nbegan to reel and stagger and grab at the empty air; then they broke\r\napart and fled in every direction, shrieking, as if in intolerable pain.\r\nHe had crushed a rib of each of them with that little puff. We could not\r\nhelp asking if their life-chart was changed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, entirely. Some have gained years, some have lost them. Some few\r\nwill profit in various ways by the change, but only that few.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe did not ask if we had brought poor Fischer\'s luck to any of them.\r\nWe did not wish to know. We fully believed in Satan\'s desire to do us\r\nkindnesses, but we were losing confidence in his judgment. It was at\r\nthis time that our growing anxiety to have him look over our life-charts\r\nand suggest improvements began to fade out and give place to other\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nFor a day or two the whole village was a chattering turmoil over Frau\r\nBrandt\'s case and over the mysterious calamity that had overtaken the\r\nmob, and at her trial the place was crowded. She was easily convicted of\r\nher blasphemies, for she uttered those terrible words again and said she\r\nwould not take them back. When warned that she was imperiling her life,\r\nshe said they could take it in welcome, she did not want it, she would\r\nrather live with the professional devils in perdition than with these\r\nimitators in the village. They accused her of breaking all those ribs\r\nby witchcraft, and asked her if she was not a witch? She answered\r\nscornfully:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. If I had that power would any of you holy hypocrites be alive five\r\nminutes? No; I would strike you all dead. Pronounce your sentence and\r\nlet me go; I am tired of your society.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they found her guilty, and she was excommunicated and cut off from\r\nthe joys of heaven and doomed to the fires of hell; then she was clothed\r\nin a coarse robe and delivered to the secular arm, and conducted to the\r\nmarket-place, the bell solemnly tolling the while. We saw her chained to\r\nthe stake, and saw the first film of blue smoke rise on the still air.\r\nThen her hard face softened, and she looked upon the packed crowd in\r\nfront of her and said, with gentleness:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe played together once, in long-agone days when we were innocent\r\nlittle creatures. For the sake of that, I forgive you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe went away then, and did not see the fires consume her, but we heard\r\nthe shrieks, although we put our fingers in our ears. When they ceased\r\nwe knew she was in heaven, notwithstanding the excommunication; and we\r\nwere glad of her death and not sorry that we had brought it about.\r\n\r\nOne day, a little while after this, Satan appeared again. We were always\r\nwatching out for him, for life was never very stagnant when he was by.\r\nHe came upon us at that place in the woods where we had first met him.\r\nBeing boys, we wanted to be entertained; we asked him to do a show for\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cwould you like to see a history of the progress\r\nof the human race?--its development of that product which it calls\r\ncivilization?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe said we should.\r\n\r\nSo, with a thought, he turned the place into the Garden of Eden, and we\r\nsaw Abel praying by his altar; then Cain came walking toward him with\r\nhis club, and did not seem to see us, and would have stepped on my foot\r\nif I had not drawn it in. He spoke to his brother in a language which\r\nwe did not understand; then he grew violent and threatening, and we knew\r\nwhat was going to happen, and turned away our heads for the moment; but\r\nwe heard the crash of the blows and heard the shrieks and the groans;\r\nthen there was silence, and we saw Abel lying in his blood and gasping\r\nout his life, and Cain standing over him and looking down at him,\r\nvengeful and unrepentant.\r\n\r\nThen the vision vanished, and was followed by a long series of unknown\r\nwars, murders, and massacres. Next we had the Flood, and the Ark tossing\r\naround in the stormy waters, with lofty mountains in the distance\r\nshowing veiled and dim through the rain. Satan said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe progress of your race was not satisfactory. It is to have another\r\nchance now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scene changed, and we saw Noah overcome with wine.\r\n\r\nNext, we had Sodom and Gomorrah, and \xe2\x80\x9cthe attempt to discover two or\r\nthree respectable persons there,\xe2\x80\x9d as Satan described it. Next, Lot and\r\nhis daughters in the cave.\r\n\r\nNext came the Hebraic wars, and we saw the victors massacre the\r\nsurvivors and their cattle, and save the young girls alive and\r\ndistribute them around.\r\n\r\nNext we had Jael; and saw her slip into the tent and drive the nail into\r\nthe temple of her sleeping guest; and we were so close that when the\r\nblood gushed out it trickled in a little, red stream to our feet, and we\r\ncould have stained our hands in it if we had wanted to.\r\n\r\nNext we had Egyptian wars, Greek wars, Roman wars, hideous drenchings\r\nof the earth with blood; and we saw the treacheries of the Romans toward\r\nthe Carthaginians, and the sickening spectacle of the massacre of\r\nthose brave people. Also we saw Caesar invade Britain--\xe2\x80\x9cnot that those\r\nbarbarians had done him any harm, but because he wanted their land, and\r\ndesired to confer the blessings of civilization upon their widows and\r\norphans,\xe2\x80\x9d as Satan explained.\r\n\r\nNext, Christianity was born. Then ages of Europe passed in review before\r\nus, and we saw Christianity and Civilization march hand in hand through\r\nthose ages, \xe2\x80\x9cleaving famine and death and desolation in their wake, and\r\nother signs of the progress of the human race,\xe2\x80\x9d as Satan observed.\r\n\r\nAnd always we had wars, and more wars, and still other wars--all over\r\nEurope, all over the world. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes in the private interest of royal\r\nfamilies,\xe2\x80\x9d Satan said, \xe2\x80\x9csometimes to crush a weak nation; but never a\r\nwar started by the aggressor for any clean purpose--there is no such war\r\nin the history of the race.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Satan, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have seen your progress down to the present, and\r\nyou must confess that it is wonderful--in its way. We must now exhibit\r\nthe future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe showed us slaughters more terrible in their destruction of life, more\r\ndevastating in their engines of war, than any we had seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou perceive,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you have made continual progress. Cain\r\ndid his murder with a club; the Hebrews did their murders with javelins\r\nand swords; the Greeks and Romans added protective armor and the fine\r\narts of military organization and generalship; the Christian has added\r\nguns and gunpowder; a few centuries from now he will have so greatly\r\nimproved the deadly effectiveness of his weapons of slaughter that\r\nall men will confess that without Christian civilization war must have\r\nremained a poor and trifling thing to the end of time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he began to laugh in the most unfeeling way, and make fun of the\r\nhuman race, although he knew that what he had been saying shamed us and\r\nwounded us. No one but an angel could have acted so; but suffering is\r\nnothing to them; they do not know what it is, except by hearsay.\r\n\r\nMore than once Seppi and I had tried in a humble and diffident way to\r\nconvert him, and as he had remained silent we had taken his silence as\r\na sort of encouragement; necessarily, then, this talk of his was a\r\ndisappointment to us, for it showed that we had made no deep impression\r\nupon him. The thought made us sad, and we knew then how the missionary\r\nmust feel when he has been cherishing a glad hope and has seen it\r\nblighted. We kept our grief to ourselves, knowing that this was not the\r\ntime to continue our work.\r\n\r\nSatan laughed his unkind laugh to a finish; then he said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a\r\nremarkable progress. In five or six thousand years five or six high\r\ncivilizations have risen, flourished, commanded the wonder of the world,\r\nthen faded out and disappeared; and not one of them except the latest\r\never invented any sweeping and adequate way to kill people. They all did\r\ntheir best--to kill being the chiefest ambition of the human race\r\nand the earliest incident in its history--but only the Christian\r\ncivilization has scored a triumph to be proud of. Two or three centuries\r\nfrom now it will be recognized that all the competent killers are\r\nChristians; then the pagan world will go to school to the Christian--not\r\nto acquire his religion, but his guns. The Turk and the Chinaman will\r\nbuy those to kill missionaries and converts with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time his theater was at work again, and before our eyes nation\r\nafter nation drifted by, during two or three centuries, a mighty\r\nprocession, an endless procession, raging, struggling, wallowing through\r\nseas of blood, smothered in battle-smoke through which the flags glinted\r\nand the red jets from the cannon darted; and always we heard the thunder\r\nof the guns and the cries of the dying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what does it amount to?\xe2\x80\x9d said Satan, with his evil chuckle.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing at all. You gain nothing; you always come out where you went\r\nin. For a million years the race has gone on monotonously propagating\r\nitself and monotonously reperforming this dull nonsense--to what end?\r\nNo wisdom can guess! Who gets a profit out of it? Nobody but a parcel\r\nof usurping little monarchs and nobilities who despise you; would feel\r\ndefiled if you touched them; would shut the door in your face if you\r\nproposed to call; whom you slave for, fight for, die for, and are not\r\nashamed of it, but proud; whose existence is a perpetual insult to you\r\nand you are afraid to resent it; who are mendicants supported by your\r\nalms, yet assume toward you the airs of benefactor toward beggar; who\r\naddress you in the language of master to slave, and are answered in the\r\nlanguage of slave to master; who are worshiped by you with your mouth,\r\nwhile in your heart--if you have one--you despise yourselves for it.\r\nThe first man was a hypocrite and a coward, qualities which have not yet\r\nfailed in his line; it is the foundation upon which all civilizations\r\nhave been built. Drink to their perpetuation! Drink to their\r\naugmentation! Drink to--\xe2\x80\x9d Then he saw by our faces how much we were\r\nhurt, and he cut his sentence short and stopped chuckling, and his\r\nmanner changed. He said, gently: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, we will drink one another\'s\r\nhealth, and let civilization go. The wine which has flown to our hands\r\nout of space by desire is earthly, and good enough for that other toast;\r\nbut throw away the glasses; we will drink this one in wine which has not\r\nvisited this world before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe obeyed, and reached up and received the new cups as they descended.\r\nThey were shapely and beautiful goblets, but they were not made of any\r\nmaterial that we were acquainted with. They seemed to be in motion, they\r\nseemed to be alive; and certainly the colors in them were in motion.\r\nThey were very brilliant and sparkling, and of every tint, and they were\r\nnever still, but flowed to and fro in rich tides which met and broke and\r\nflashed out dainty explosions of enchanting color. I think it was most\r\nlike opals washing about in waves and flashing out their splendid fires.\r\nBut there is nothing to compare the wine with. We drank it, and felt a\r\nstrange and witching ecstasy as of heaven go stealing through us, and\r\nSeppi\'s eyes filled and he said worshipingly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall be there some day, and then--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe glanced furtively at Satan, and I think he hoped Satan would say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you will be there some day,\xe2\x80\x9d but Satan seemed to be thinking about\r\nsomething else, and said nothing. This made me feel ghastly, for I knew\r\nhe had heard; nothing, spoken or unspoken, ever escaped him. Poor Seppi\r\nlooked distressed, and did not finish his remark. The goblets rose\r\nand clove their way into the sky, a triplet of radiant sundogs, and\r\ndisappeared. Why didn\'t they stay? It seemed a bad sign, and depressed\r\nme. Should I ever see mine again? Would Seppi ever see his?\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9\r\n\r\nIt was wonderful, the mastery Satan had over time and distance. For him\r\nthey did not exist. He called them human inventions, and said they were\r\nartificialities. We often went to the most distant parts of the globe\r\nwith him, and stayed weeks and months, and yet were gone only a fraction\r\nof a second, as a rule. You could prove it by the clock. One day when\r\nour people were in such awful distress because the witch commission were\r\nafraid to proceed against the astrologer and Father Peter\'s household,\r\nor against any, indeed, but the poor and the friendless, they lost\r\npatience and took to witch-hunting on their own score, and began to\r\nchase a born lady who was known to have the habit of curing people by\r\ndevilish arts, such as bathing them, washing them, and nourishing them\r\ninstead of bleeding them and purging them through the ministrations of a\r\nbarber-surgeon in the proper way. She came flying down, with the howling\r\nand cursing mob after her, and tried to take refuge in houses, but the\r\ndoors were shut in her face. They chased her more than half an hour, we\r\nfollowing to see it, and at last she was exhausted and fell, and they\r\ncaught her. They dragged her to a tree and threw a rope over the limb,\r\nand began to make a noose in it, some holding her, meantime, and she\r\ncrying and begging, and her young daughter looking on and weeping, but\r\nafraid to say or do anything.\r\n\r\nThey hanged the lady, and I threw a stone at her, although in my heart\r\nI was sorry for her; but all were throwing stones and each was watching\r\nhis neighbor, and if I had not done as the others did it would have been\r\nnoticed and spoken of. Satan burst out laughing.\r\n\r\nAll that were near by turned upon him, astonished and not pleased.\r\nIt was an ill time to laugh, for his free and scoffing ways and his\r\nsupernatural music had brought him under suspicion all over the town and\r\nturned many privately against him. The big blacksmith called attention\r\nto him now, raising his voice so that all should hear, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you laughing at? Answer! Moreover, please explain to the\r\ncompany why you threw no stone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure I did not throw a stone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. You needn\'t try to get out of it; I had my eye on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I--I noticed you!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted two others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree witnesses,\xe2\x80\x9d said Satan: \xe2\x80\x9cMueller, the blacksmith; Klein, the\r\nbutcher\'s man; Pfeiffer, the weaver\'s journeyman. Three very ordinary\r\nliars. Are there any more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind whether there are others or not, and never mind about what\r\nyou consider us--three\'s enough to settle your matter for you. You\'ll\r\nprove that you threw a stone, or it shall go hard with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\'s so!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the crowd, and surged up as closely as they could\r\nto the center of interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd first you will answer that other question,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the blacksmith,\r\npleased with himself for being mouthpiece to the public and hero of the\r\noccasion. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you laughing at?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSatan smiled and answered, pleasantly: \xe2\x80\x9cTo see three cowards stoning a\r\ndying lady when they were so near death themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYou could see the superstitious crowd shrink and catch their breath,\r\nunder the sudden shock. The blacksmith, with a show of bravado, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! What do you know about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? Everything. By profession I am a fortune-teller, and I read the\r\nhands of you three--and some others--when you lifted them to stone\r\nthe woman. One of you will die to-morrow week; another of you will die\r\nto-night; the third has but five minutes to live--and yonder is the\r\nclock!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt made a sensation. The faces of the crowd blanched, and turned\r\nmechanically toward the clock. The butcher and the weaver seemed smitten\r\nwith an illness, but the blacksmith braced up and said, with spirit:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not long to wait for prediction number one. If it fails, young\r\nmaster, you will not live a whole minute after, I promise you that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo one said anything; all watched the clock in a deep stillness which\r\nwas impressive. When four and a half minutes were gone the blacksmith\r\ngave a sudden gasp and clapped his hands upon his heart, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cGive\r\nme breath! Give me room!\xe2\x80\x9d and began to sink down. The crowd surged back,\r\nno one offering to support him, and he fell lumbering to the ground and\r\nwas dead. The people stared at him, then at Satan, then at one another;\r\nand their lips moved, but no words came. Then Satan said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree saw that I threw no stone. Perhaps there are others; let them\r\nspeak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt struck a kind of panic into them, and, although no one answered him,\r\nmany began to violently accuse one another, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cYou said he didn\'t\r\nthrow,\xe2\x80\x9d and getting for reply, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a lie, and I will make you eat\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d And so in a moment they were in a raging and noisy turmoil,\r\nand beating and banging one another; and in the midst was the only\r\nindifferent one--the dead lady hanging from her rope, her troubles\r\nforgotten, her spirit at peace.\r\n\r\nSo we walked away, and I was not at ease, but was saying to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\ntold them he was laughing at them, but it was a lie--he was laughing at\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat made him laugh again, and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I was laughing at you,\r\nbecause, in fear of what others might report about you, you stoned the\r\nwoman when your heart revolted at the act--but I was laughing at the\r\nothers, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause their case was yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there were sixty-eight people there, and sixty-two of them had no\r\nmore desire to throw a stone than you had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSatan!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\'s true. I know your race. It is made up of sheep. It is governed\r\nby minorities, seldom or never by majorities. It suppresses its feelings\r\nand its beliefs and follows the handful that makes the most noise.\r\nSometimes the noisy handful is right, sometimes wrong; but no matter,\r\nthe crowd follows it. The vast majority of the race, whether savage or\r\ncivilized, are secretly kind-hearted and shrink from inflicting pain,\r\nbut in the presence of the aggressive and pitiless minority they don\'t\r\ndare to assert themselves. Think of it! One kind-hearted creature spies\r\nupon another, and sees to it that he loyally helps in iniquities which\r\nrevolt both of them. Speaking as an expert, I know that ninety-nine out\r\nof a hundred of your race were strongly against the killing of witches\r\nwhen that foolishness was first agitated by a handful of pious lunatics\r\nin the long ago. And I know that even to-day, after ages of transmitted\r\nprejudice and silly teaching, only one person in twenty puts any real\r\nheart into the harrying of a witch. And yet apparently everybody hates\r\nwitches and wants them killed. Some day a handful will rise up on the\r\nother side and make the most noise--perhaps even a single daring man\r\nwith a big voice and a determined front will do it--and in a week all\r\nthe sheep will wheel and follow him, and witch-hunting will come to a\r\nsudden end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonarchies, aristocracies, and religions are all based upon that large\r\ndefect in your race--the individual\'s distrust of his neighbor, and his\r\ndesire, for safety\'s or comfort\'s sake, to stand well in his neighbor\'s\r\neye. These institutions will always remain, and always flourish, and\r\nalways oppress you, affront you, and degrade you, because you will\r\nalways be and remain slaves of minorities. There was never a country\r\nwhere the majority of the people were in their secret hearts loyal to\r\nany of these institutions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not like to hear our race called sheep, and said I did not think\r\nthey were.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, it is true, lamb,\xe2\x80\x9d said Satan. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at you in war--what mutton\r\nyou are, and how ridiculous!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn war? How?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere has never been a just one, never an honorable one--on the part\r\nof the instigator of the war. I can see a million years ahead, and this\r\nrule will never change in so many as half a dozen instances. The\r\nloud little handful--as usual--will shout for the war. The pulpit\r\nwill--warily and cautiously--object--at first; the great, big, dull bulk\r\nof the nation will rub its sleepy eyes and try to make out why there\r\nshould be a war, and will say, earnestly and indignantly, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is unjust\r\nand dishonorable, and there is no necessity for it.\xe2\x80\x9d Then the handful\r\nwill shout louder. A few fair men on the other side will argue and\r\nreason against the war with speech and pen, and at first will have a\r\nhearing and be applauded; but it will not last long; those others will\r\noutshout them, and presently the anti-war audiences will thin out\r\nand lose popularity. Before long you will see this curious thing: the\r\nspeakers stoned from the platform, and free speech strangled by hordes\r\nof furious men who in their secret hearts are still at one with those\r\nstoned speakers--as earlier--but do not dare to say so. And now the\r\nwhole nation--pulpit and all--will take up the war-cry, and shout itself\r\nhoarse, and mob any honest man who ventures to open his mouth; and\r\npresently such mouths will cease to open. Next the statesmen will invent\r\ncheap lies, putting the blame upon the nation that is attacked, and\r\nevery man will be glad of those conscience-soothing falsities, and will\r\ndiligently study them, and refuse to examine any refutations of them;\r\nand thus he will by and by convince himself that the war is just, and\r\nwill thank God for the better sleep he enjoys after this process of\r\ngrotesque self-deception.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 10\r\n\r\nDays and days went by now, and no Satan. It was dull without him. But\r\nthe astrologer, who had returned from his excursion to the moon, went\r\nabout the village, braving public opinion, and getting a stone in the\r\nmiddle of his back now and then when some witch-hater got a safe chance\r\nto throw it and dodge out of sight. Meantime two influences had been\r\nworking well for Marget. That Satan, who was quite indifferent to her,\r\nhad stopped going to her house after a visit or two had hurt her pride,\r\nand she had set herself the task of banishing him from her heart.\r\nReports of Wilhelm Meidling\'s dissipation brought to her from time to\r\ntime by old Ursula had touched her with remorse, jealousy of Satan\r\nbeing the cause of it; and so now, these two matters working upon her\r\ntogether, she was getting a good profit out of the combination--her\r\ninterest in Satan was steadily cooling, her interest in Wilhelm as\r\nsteadily warming. All that was needed to complete her conversion\r\nwas that Wilhelm should brace up and do something that should cause\r\nfavorable talk and incline the public toward him again.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity came now. Marget sent and asked him to defend her\r\nuncle in the approaching trial, and he was greatly pleased, and stopped\r\ndrinking and began his preparations with diligence. With more diligence\r\nthan hope, in fact, for it was not a promising case. He had many\r\ninterviews in his office with Seppi and me, and threshed out our\r\ntestimony pretty thoroughly, thinking to find some valuable grains among\r\nthe chaff, but the harvest was poor, of course.\r\n\r\nIf Satan would only come! That was my constant thought. He could\r\ninvent some way to win the case; for he had said it would be won, so\r\nhe necessarily knew how it could be done. But the days dragged on, and\r\nstill he did not come. Of course I did not doubt that it would be won,\r\nand that Father Peter would be happy for the rest of his life, since\r\nSatan had said so; yet I knew I should be much more comfortable if he\r\nwould come and tell us how to manage it. It was getting high time for\r\nFather Peter to have a saving change toward happiness, for by general\r\nreport he was worn out with his imprisonment and the ignominy that was\r\nburdening him, and was like to die of his miseries unless he got relief\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\nAt last the trial came on, and the people gathered from all around to\r\nwitness it; among them many strangers from considerable distances. Yes,\r\neverybody was there except the accused. He was too feeble in body for\r\nthe strain. But Marget was present, and keeping up her hope and her\r\nspirit the best she could. The money was present, too. It was emptied\r\non the table, and was handled and caressed and examined by such as were\r\nprivileged.\r\n\r\nThe astrologer was put in the witness-box. He had on his best hat and\r\nrobe for the occasion.\r\n\r\nQUESTION. You claim that this money is yours?\r\n\r\nANSWER. I do.\r\n\r\nQ. How did you come by it?\r\n\r\nA. I found the bag in the road when I was returning from a journey.\r\n\r\nQ. When?\r\n\r\nA. More than two years ago.\r\n\r\nQ. What did you do with it?\r\n\r\nA. I brought it home and hid it in a secret place in my observatory,\r\nintending to find the owner if I could.\r\n\r\nQ. You endeavored to find him?\r\n\r\nA. I made diligent inquiry during several months, but nothing came of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nQ. And then?\r\n\r\nA. I thought it not worth while to look further, and was minded to use\r\nthe money in finishing the wing of the foundling-asylum connected with\r\nthe priory and nunnery. So I took it out of its hiding-place and counted\r\nit to see if any of it was missing. And then--\r\n\r\nQ. Why do you stop? Proceed.\r\n\r\nA. I am sorry to have to say this, but just as I had finished and was\r\nrestoring the bag to its place, I looked up and there stood Father Peter\r\nbehind me.\r\n\r\nSeveral murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cThat looks bad,\xe2\x80\x9d but others answered, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, but he is\r\nsuch a liar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nQ. That made you uneasy?\r\n\r\nA. No; I thought nothing of it at the time, for Father Peter often came\r\nto me unannounced to ask for a little help in his need.\r\n\r\nMarget blushed crimson at hearing her uncle falsely and impudently\r\ncharged with begging, especially from one he had always denounced as a\r\nfraud, and was going to speak, but remembered herself in time and held\r\nher peace.\r\n\r\nQ. Proceed.\r\n\r\nA. In the end I was afraid to contribute the money to the\r\nfoundling-asylum, but elected to wait yet another year and continue\r\nmy inquiries. When I heard of Father Peter\'s find I was glad, and no\r\nsuspicion entered my mind; when I came home a day or two later and\r\ndiscovered that my own money was gone I still did not suspect until\r\nthree circumstances connected with Father Peter\'s good fortune struck me\r\nas being singular coincidences.\r\n\r\nQ. Pray name them.\r\n\r\nA. Father Peter had found his money in a path--I had found mine in a\r\nroad. Father Peter\'s find consisted exclusively of gold ducats--mine\r\nalso. Father Peter found eleven hundred and seven ducats--I exactly the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nThis closed his evidence, and certainly it made a strong impression on\r\nthe house; one could see that.\r\n\r\nWilhelm Meidling asked him some questions, then called us boys, and we\r\ntold our tale. It made the people laugh, and we were ashamed. We were\r\nfeeling pretty badly, anyhow, because Wilhelm was hopeless, and showed\r\nit. He was doing as well as he could, poor young fellow, but nothing was\r\nin his favor, and such sympathy as there was was now plainly not with\r\nhis client. It might be difficult for court and people to believe\r\nthe astrologer\'s story, considering his character, but it was almost\r\nimpossible to believe Father Peter\'s. We were already feeling badly\r\nenough, but when the astrologer\'s lawyer said he believed he would not\r\nask us any questions--for our story was a little delicate and it would\r\nbe cruel for him to put any strain upon it--everybody tittered, and\r\nit was almost more than we could bear. Then he made a sarcastic little\r\nspeech, and got so much fun out of our tale, and it seemed so ridiculous\r\nand childish and every way impossible and foolish, that it made\r\neverybody laugh till the tears came; and at last Marget could not keep\r\nup her courage any longer, but broke down and cried, and I was so sorry\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\nNow I noticed something that braced me up. It was Satan standing\r\nalongside of Wilhelm! And there was such a contrast!--Satan looked so\r\nconfident, had such a spirit in his eyes and face, and Wilhelm looked so\r\ndepressed and despondent. We two were comfortable now, and judged that\r\nhe would testify and persuade the bench and the people that black was\r\nwhite and white black, or any other color he wanted it. We glanced\r\naround to see what the strangers in the house thought of him, for he was\r\nbeautiful, you know--stunning, in fact--but no one was noticing him; so\r\nwe knew by that that he was invisible.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer was saying his last words; and while he was saying them Satan\r\nbegan to melt into Wilhelm. He melted into him and disappeared; and then\r\nthere was a change, when his spirit began to look out of Wilhelm\'s eyes.\r\n\r\nThat lawyer finished quite seriously, and with dignity. He pointed to\r\nthe money, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe love of it is the root of all evil. There it lies, the ancient\r\ntempter, newly red with the shame of its latest victory--the dishonor of\r\na priest of God and his two poor juvenile helpers in crime. If it could\r\nbut speak, let us hope that it would be constrained to confess that of\r\nall its conquests this was the basest and the most pathetic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down. Wilhelm rose and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the testimony of the accuser I gather that he found this money\r\nin a road more than two years ago. Correct me, sir, if I misunderstood\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe astrologer said his understanding of it was correct.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the money so found was never out of his hands thenceforth up to a\r\ncertain definite date--the last day of last year. Correct me, sir, if I\r\nam wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe astrologer nodded his head. Wilhelm turned to the bench and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I prove that this money here was not that money, then it is not\r\nhis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not; but this is irregular. If you had such a witness it was\r\nyour duty to give proper notice of it and have him here to--\xe2\x80\x9d He broke\r\noff and began to consult with the other judges. Meantime that other\r\nlawyer got up excited and began to protest against allowing new\r\nwitnesses to be brought into the case at this late stage.\r\n\r\nThe judges decided that his contention was just and must be allowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this is not a new witness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wilhelm. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has already been\r\npartly examined. I speak of the coin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe coin? What can the coin say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt can say it is not the coin that the astrologer once possessed. It\r\ncan say it was not in existence last December. By its date it can say\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd it was so! There was the greatest excitement in the court while that\r\nlawyer and the judges were reaching for coins and examining them and\r\nexclaiming. And everybody was full of admiration of Wilhelm\'s brightness\r\nin happening to think of that neat idea. At last order was called and\r\nthe court said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll of the coins but four are of the date of the present year. The\r\ncourt tenders its sincere sympathy to the accused, and its deep regret\r\nthat he, an innocent man, through an unfortunate mistake, has suffered\r\nthe undeserved humiliation of imprisonment and trial. The case is\r\ndismissed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the money could speak, after all, though that lawyer thought it\r\ncouldn\'t. The court rose, and almost everybody came forward to shake\r\nhands with Marget and congratulate her, and then to shake with Wilhelm\r\nand praise him; and Satan had stepped out of Wilhelm and was standing\r\naround looking on full of interest, and people walking through him every\r\nwhich way, not knowing he was there. And Wilhelm could not explain why\r\nhe only thought of the date on the coins at the last moment, instead\r\nof earlier; he said it just occurred to him, all of a sudden, like an\r\ninspiration, and he brought it right out without any hesitation, for,\r\nalthough he didn\'t examine the coins, he seemed, somehow, to know it was\r\ntrue. That was honest of him, and like him; another would have pretended\r\nhe had thought of it earlier, and was keeping it back for a surprise.\r\n\r\nHe had dulled down a little now; not much, but still you could notice\r\nthat he hadn\'t that luminous look in his eyes that he had while Satan\r\nwas in him. He nearly got it back, though, for a moment when Marget came\r\nand praised him and thanked him and couldn\'t keep him from seeing how\r\nproud she was of him. The astrologer went off dissatisfied and cursing,\r\nand Solomon Isaacs gathered up the money and carried it away. It was\r\nFather Peter\'s for good and all, now.\r\n\r\nSatan was gone. I judged that he had spirited himself away to the jail\r\nto tell the prisoner the news; and in this I was right. Marget and\r\nthe rest of us hurried thither at our best speed, in a great state of\r\nrejoicing.\r\n\r\nWell, what Satan had done was this: he had appeared before that\r\npoor prisoner, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cThe trial is over, and you stand forever\r\ndisgraced as a thief--by verdict of the court!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shock unseated the old man\'s reason. When we arrived, ten minutes\r\nlater, he was parading pompously up and down and delivering commands to\r\nthis and that and the other constable or jailer, and calling them Grand\r\nchamberlain, and Prince This and Prince That, and Admiral of the Fleet,\r\nField Marshal in Command, and all such fustian, and was as happy as a\r\nbird. He thought he was Emperor!\r\n\r\nMarget flung herself on his breast and cried, and indeed everybody\r\nwas moved almost to heartbreak. He recognized Marget, but could not\r\nunderstand why she should cry. He patted her on the shoulder and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\'t do it, dear; remember, there are witnesses, and it is not\r\nbecoming in the Crown Princess. Tell me your trouble--it shall be\r\nmended; there is nothing the Emperor cannot do.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he looked around\r\nand saw old Ursula with her apron to her eyes. He was puzzled at that,\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThrough her sobs she got out words explaining that she was distressed to\r\nsee him--\xe2\x80\x9cso.\xe2\x80\x9d He reflected over that a moment, then muttered, as if to\r\nhimself: \xe2\x80\x9cA singular old thing, the Dowager Duchess--means well, but is\r\nalways snuffling and never able to tell what it is about. It is because\r\nshe doesn\'t know.\xe2\x80\x9d His eyes fell on Wilhelm. \xe2\x80\x9cPrince of India,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI divine that it is you that the Crown Princess is concerned about.\r\nHer tears shall be dried; I will no longer stand between you; she shall\r\nshare your throne; and between you you shall inherit mine. There, little\r\nlady, have I done well? You can smile now--isn\'t it so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe petted Marget and kissed her, and was so contented with himself and\r\nwith everybody that he could not do enough for us all, but began to give\r\naway kingdoms and such things right and left, and the least that any of\r\nus got was a principality. And so at last, being persuaded to go home,\r\nhe marched in imposing state; and when the crowds along the way saw how\r\nit gratified him to be hurrahed at, they humored him to the top of his\r\ndesire, and he responded with condescending bows and gracious smiles,\r\nand often stretched out a hand and said, \xe2\x80\x9cBless you, my people!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs pitiful a sight as ever I saw. And Marget, and old Ursula crying all\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\nOn my road home I came upon Satan, and reproached him with deceiving\r\nme with that lie. He was not embarrassed, but said, quite simply and\r\ncomposedly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you mistake; it was the truth. I said he would be happy the rest of\r\nhis days, and he will, for he will always think he is the Emperor, and\r\nhis pride in it and his joy in it will endure to the end. He is now, and\r\nwill remain, the one utterly happy person in this empire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the method of it, Satan, the method! Couldn\'t you have done it\r\nwithout depriving him of his reason?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to irritate Satan, but that accomplished it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an ass you are!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you so unobservant as not to have\r\nfound out that sanity and happiness are an impossible combination?\r\nNo sane man can be happy, for to him life is real, and he sees what a\r\nfearful thing it is. Only the mad can be happy, and not many of those.\r\nThe few that imagine themselves kings or gods are happy, the rest are no\r\nhappier than the sane. Of course, no man is entirely in his right mind\r\nat any time, but I have been referring to the extreme cases. I have\r\ntaken from this man that trumpery thing which the race regards as a\r\nMind; I have replaced his tin life with a silver-gilt fiction; you\r\nsee the result--and you criticize! I said I would make him permanently\r\nhappy, and I have done it. I have made him happy by the only means\r\npossible to his race--and you are not satisfied!\xe2\x80\x9d He heaved a\r\ndiscouraged sigh, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me that this race is hard to\r\nplease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere it was, you see. He didn\'t seem to know any way to do a person\r\na favor except by killing him or making a lunatic out of him. I\r\napologized, as well as I could; but privately I did not think much of\r\nhis processes--at that time.\r\n\r\nSatan was accustomed to say that our race lived a life of continuous and\r\nuninterrupted self-deception. It duped itself from cradle to grave with\r\nshams and delusions which it mistook for realities, and this made its\r\nentire life a sham. Of the score of fine qualities which it imagined it\r\nhad and was vain of, it really possessed hardly one. It regarded\r\nitself as gold, and was only brass. One day when he was in this vein\r\nhe mentioned a detail--the sense of humor. I cheered up then, and took\r\nissue. I said we possessed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere spoke the race!\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9calways ready to claim what it hasn\'t\r\ngot, and mistake its ounce of brass filings for a ton of gold-dust. You\r\nhave a mongrel perception of humor, nothing more; a multitude of you\r\npossess that. This multitude see the comic side of a thousand low-grade\r\nand trivial things--broad incongruities, mainly; grotesqueries,\r\nabsurdities, evokers of the horse-laugh. The ten thousand high-grade\r\ncomicalities which exist in the world are sealed from their dull\r\nvision. Will a day come when the race will detect the funniness of these\r\njuvenilities and laugh at them--and by laughing at them destroy them?\r\nFor your race, in its poverty, has unquestionably one really\r\neffective weapon--laughter. Power, money, persuasion, supplication,\r\npersecution--these can lift at a colossal humbug--push it a\r\nlittle--weaken it a little, century by century; but only laughter can\r\nblow it to rags and atoms at a blast. Against the assault of laughter\r\nnothing can stand. You are always fussing and fighting with your other\r\nweapons. Do you ever use that one? No; you leave it lying rusting. As a\r\nrace, do you ever use it at all? No; you lack sense and the courage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were traveling at the time and stopped at a little city in India and\r\nlooked on while a juggler did his tricks before a group of natives. They\r\nwere wonderful, but I knew Satan could beat that game, and I begged him\r\nto show off a little, and he said he would. He changed himself into a\r\nnative in turban and breech-cloth, and very considerately conferred on\r\nme a temporary knowledge of the language.\r\n\r\nThe juggler exhibited a seed, covered it with earth in a small\r\nflower-pot, then put a rag over the pot; after a minute the rag began to\r\nrise; in ten minutes it had risen a foot; then the rag was removed and a\r\nlittle tree was exposed, with leaves upon it and ripe fruit. We ate the\r\nfruit, and it was good. But Satan said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you cover the pot? Can\'t you grow the tree in the sunlight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the juggler; \xe2\x80\x9cno one can do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are only an apprentice; you don\'t know your trade. Give me the\r\nseed. I will show you.\xe2\x80\x9d He took the seed and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I raise\r\nfrom it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a cherry seed; of course you will raise a cherry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no; that is a trifle; any novice can do that. Shall I raise an\r\norange-tree from it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes!\xe2\x80\x9d and the juggler laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd shall I make it bear other fruits as well as oranges?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf God wills!\xe2\x80\x9d and they all laughed.\r\n\r\nSatan put the seed in the ground, put a handful of dust on it, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRise!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA tiny stem shot up and began to grow, and grew so fast that in five\r\nminutes it was a great tree, and we were sitting in the shade of it.\r\nThere was a murmur of wonder, then all looked up and saw a strange and\r\npretty sight, for the branches were heavy with fruits of many kinds and\r\ncolors--oranges, grapes, bananas, peaches, cherries, apricots, and so\r\non. Baskets were brought, and the unlading of the tree began; and\r\nthe people crowded around Satan and kissed his hand, and praised him,\r\ncalling him the prince of jugglers. The news went about the town, and\r\neverybody came running to see the wonder--and they remembered to bring\r\nbaskets, too. But the tree was equal to the occasion; it put out new\r\nfruits as fast as any were removed; baskets were filled by the score and\r\nby the hundred, but always the supply remained undiminished. At last a\r\nforeigner in white linen and sun-helmet arrived, and exclaimed, angrily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAway from here! Clear out, you dogs; the tree is on my lands and is my\r\nproperty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe natives put down their baskets and made humble obeisance. Satan made\r\nhumble obeisance, too, with his fingers to his forehead, in the native\r\nway, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease let them have their pleasure for an hour, sir--only that, and\r\nno longer. Afterward you may forbid them; and you will still have more\r\nfruit than you and the state together can consume in a year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis made the foreigner very angry, and he cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cWho are you, you\r\nvagabond, to tell your betters what they may do and what they mayn\'t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and he struck Satan with his cane and followed this error with a kick.\r\n\r\nThe fruits rotted on the branches, and the leaves withered and fell. The\r\nforeigner gazed at the bare limbs with the look of one who is surprised,\r\nand not gratified. Satan said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake good care of the tree, for its health and yours are bound\r\ntogether. It will never bear again, but if you tend it well it will live\r\nlong. Water its roots once in each hour every night--and do it yourself;\r\nit must not be done by proxy, and to do it in daylight will not answer.\r\nIf you fail only once in any night, the tree will die, and you likewise.\r\nDo not go home to your own country any more--you would not reach there;\r\nmake no business or pleasure engagements which require you to go outside\r\nyour gate at night--you cannot afford the risk; do not rent or sell this\r\nplace--it would be injudicious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe foreigner was proud and wouldn\'t beg, but I thought he looked as if\r\nhe would like to. While he stood gazing at Satan we vanished away and\r\nlanded in Ceylon.\r\n\r\nI was sorry for that man; sorry Satan hadn\'t been his customary self\r\nand killed him or made him a lunatic. It would have been a mercy. Satan\r\noverheard the thought, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would have done it but for his wife, who has not offended me. She is\r\ncoming to him presently from their native land, Portugal. She is well,\r\nbut has not long to live, and has been yearning to see him and persuade\r\nhim to go back with her next year. She will die without knowing he can\'t\r\nleave that place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won\'t tell her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe? He will not trust that secret with any one; he will reflect that\r\nit could be revealed in sleep, in the hearing of some Portuguese guest\'s\r\nservant some time or other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid none of those natives understand what you said to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone of them understood, but he will always be afraid that some of them\r\ndid. That fear will be torture to him, for he has been a harsh master\r\nto them. In his dreams he will imagine them chopping his tree down.\r\nThat will make his days uncomfortable--I have already arranged for his\r\nnights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt grieved me, though not sharply, to see him take such a malicious\r\nsatisfaction in his plans for this foreigner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he believe what you told him, Satan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe thought he didn\'t, but our vanishing helped. The tree, where there\r\nhad been no tree before--that helped. The insane and uncanny variety of\r\nfruits--the sudden withering--all these things are helps. Let him think\r\nas he may, reason as he may, one thing is certain, he will water the\r\ntree. But between this and night he will begin his changed career with a\r\nvery natural precaution--for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will fetch a priest to cast out the tree\'s devil. You are such a\r\nhumorous race--and don\'t suspect it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill he tell the priest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. He will say a juggler from Bombay created it, and that he wants the\r\njuggler\'s devil driven out of it, so that it will thrive and be fruitful\r\nagain. The priest\'s incantations will fail; then the Portuguese will\r\ngive up that scheme and get his watering-pot ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the priest will burn the tree. I know it; he will not allow it to\r\nremain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and anywhere in Europe he would burn the man, too. But in India\r\nthe people are civilized, and these things will not happen. The man will\r\ndrive the priest away and take care of the tree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI reflected a little, then said, \xe2\x80\x9cSatan, you have given him a hard life,\r\nI think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComparatively. It must not be mistaken for a holiday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe flitted from place to place around the world as we had done before,\r\nSatan showing me a hundred wonders, most of them reflecting in some\r\nway the weakness and triviality of our race. He did this now every few\r\ndays--not out of malice--I am sure of that--it only seemed to amuse and\r\ninterest him, just as a naturalist might be amused and interested by a\r\ncollection of ants.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 11\r\n\r\nFor as much as a year Satan continued these visits, but at last he came\r\nless often, and then for a long time he did not come at all. This always\r\nmade me lonely and melancholy. I felt that he was losing interest in our\r\ntiny world and might at any time abandon his visits entirely. When one\r\nday he finally came to me I was overjoyed, but only for a little while.\r\nHe had come to say good-by, he told me, and for the last time. He had\r\ninvestigations and undertakings in other corners of the universe, he\r\nsaid, that would keep him busy for a longer period than I could wait for\r\nhis return.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are going away, and will not come back any more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have comraded long together, and it has been\r\npleasant--pleasant for both; but I must go now, and we shall not see\r\neach other any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this life, Satan, but in another? We shall meet in another, surely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, all tranquilly and soberly, he made the strange answer, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is\r\nno other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA subtle influence blew upon my spirit from his, bringing with it a\r\nvague, dim, but blessed and hopeful feeling that the incredible words\r\nmight be true--even must be true.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you never suspected this, Theodor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. How could I? But if it can only be true--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA gust of thankfulness rose in my breast, but a doubt checked it before\r\nit could issue in words, and I said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut--but--we have seen that future\r\nlife--seen it in its actuality, and so--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a vision--it had no existence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could hardly breathe for the great hope that was struggling in me. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nvision?--a vi--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLife itself is only a vision, a dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was electrical. By God! I had had that very thought a thousand times\r\nin my musings!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing exists; all is a dream. God--man--the world--the sun, the moon,\r\nthe wilderness of stars--a dream, all a dream; they have no existence.\r\nNothing exists save empty space--and you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are not you--you have no body, no blood, no bones, you are but\r\na thought. I myself have no existence; I am but a dream--your dream,\r\ncreature of your imagination. In a moment you will have realized this,\r\nthen you will banish me from your visions and I shall dissolve into the\r\nnothingness out of which you made me....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am perishing already--I am failing--I am passing away. In a little\r\nwhile you will be alone in shoreless space, to wander its limitless\r\nsolitudes without friend or comrade forever--for you will remain a\r\nthought, the only existent thought, and by your nature inextinguishable,\r\nindestructible. But I, your poor servant, have revealed you to yourself\r\nand set you free. Dream other dreams, and better!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange! that you should not have suspected years ago--centuries,\r\nages, eons, ago!--for you have existed, companionless, through all the\r\neternities. Strange, indeed, that you should not have suspected that\r\nyour universe and its contents were only dreams, visions, fiction!\r\nStrange, because they are so frankly and hysterically insane--like\r\nall dreams: a God who could make good children as easily as bad, yet\r\npreferred to make bad ones; who could have made every one of them happy,\r\nyet never made a single happy one; who made them prize their bitter\r\nlife, yet stingily cut it short; who gave his angels eternal happiness\r\nunearned, yet required his other children to earn it; who gave his\r\nangels painless lives, yet cursed his other children with biting\r\nmiseries and maladies of mind and body; who mouths justice and\r\ninvented hell--mouths mercy and invented hell--mouths Golden Rules, and\r\nforgiveness multiplied by seventy times seven, and invented hell; who\r\nmouths morals to other people and has none himself; who frowns upon\r\ncrimes, yet commits them all; who created man without invitation, then\r\ntries to shuffle the responsibility for man\'s acts upon man, instead of\r\nhonorably placing it where it belongs, upon himself; and finally, with\r\naltogether divine obtuseness, invites this poor, abused slave to worship\r\nhim!...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou perceive, now, that these things are all impossible except in a\r\ndream. You perceive that they are pure and puerile insanities, the silly\r\ncreations of an imagination that is not conscious of its freaks--in a\r\nword, that they are a dream, and you the maker of it. The dream-marks\r\nare all present; you should have recognized them earlier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true, that which I have revealed to you; there is no God, no\r\nuniverse, no human race, no earthly life, no heaven, no hell. It is all\r\na dream--a grotesque and foolish dream. Nothing exists but you. And\r\nyou are but a thought--a vagrant thought, a useless thought, a homeless\r\nthought, wandering forlorn among the empty eternities!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe vanished, and left me appalled; for I knew, and realized, that all he\r\nhad said was true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FABLE\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time an artist who had painted a small and very beautiful\r\npicture placed it so that he could see it in the mirror. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\ndoubles the distance and softens it, and it is twice as lovely as it was\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe animals out in the woods heard of this through the housecat, who was\r\ngreatly admired by them because he was so learned, and so refined and\r\ncivilized, and so polite and high-bred, and could tell them so much\r\nwhich they didn\'t know before, and were not certain about afterward.\r\nThey were much excited about this new piece of gossip, and they asked\r\nquestions, so as to get at a full understanding of it. They asked what a\r\npicture was, and the cat explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a flat thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cwonderfully flat, marvelously flat,\r\nenchantingly flat and elegant. And, oh, so beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat excited them almost to a frenzy, and they said they would give the\r\nworld to see it. Then the bear asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it that makes it so beautiful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the looks of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cat.\r\n\r\nThis filled them with admiration and uncertainty, and they were more\r\nexcited than ever. Then the cow asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is a mirror?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a hole in the wall,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cat. \xe2\x80\x9cYou look in it, and there\r\nyou see the picture, and it is so dainty and charming and ethereal and\r\ninspiring in its unimaginable beauty that your head turns round and\r\nround, and you almost swoon with ecstasy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ass had not said anything as yet; he now began to throw doubts.\r\nHe said there had never been anything as beautiful as this before, and\r\nprobably wasn\'t now. He said that when it took a whole basketful of\r\nsesquipedalian adjectives to whoop up a thing of beauty, it was time for\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to see that these doubts were having an effect upon the\r\nanimals, so the cat went off offended. The subject was dropped for a\r\ncouple of days, but in the meantime curiosity was taking a fresh start,\r\nand there was a revival of interest perceptible. Then the animals\r\nassailed the ass for spoiling what could possibly have been a pleasure\r\nto them, on a mere suspicion that the picture was not beautiful, without\r\nany evidence that such was the case. The ass was not troubled; he\r\nwas calm, and said there was one way to find out who was in the right,\r\nhimself or the cat: he would go and look in that hole, and come back and\r\ntell what he found there. The animals felt relieved and grateful, and\r\nasked him to go at once--which he did.\r\n\r\nBut he did not know where he ought to stand; and so, through error,\r\nhe stood between the picture and the mirror. The result was that the\r\npicture had no chance, and didn\'t show up. He returned home and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cat lied. There was nothing in that hole but an ass. There wasn\'t\r\na sign of a flat thing visible. It was a handsome ass, and friendly, but\r\njust an ass, and nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe elephant asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see it good and clear? Were you close to it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw it good and clear, O Hathi, King of Beasts. I was so close that I\r\ntouched noses with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is very strange,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elephant; \xe2\x80\x9cthe cat was always truthful\r\nbefore--as far as we could make out. Let another witness try. Go, Baloo,\r\nlook in the hole, and come and report.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the bear went. When he came back, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth the cat and the ass have lied; there was nothing in the hole but a\r\nbear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGreat was the surprise and puzzlement of the animals. Each was now\r\nanxious to make the test himself and get at the straight truth. The\r\nelephant sent them one at a time.\r\n\r\nFirst, the cow. She found nothing in the hole but a cow.\r\n\r\nThe tiger found nothing in it but a tiger.\r\n\r\nThe lion found nothing in it but a lion.\r\n\r\nThe leopard found nothing in it but a leopard.\r\n\r\nThe camel found a camel, and nothing more.\r\n\r\nThen Hathi was wroth, and said he would have the truth, if he had to go\r\nand fetch it himself. When he returned, he abused his whole subjectry\r\nfor liars, and was in an unappeasable fury with the moral and mental\r\nblindness of the cat. He said that anybody but a near-sighted fool could\r\nsee that there was nothing in the hole but an elephant.\r\n\r\n                            MORAL, BY THE CAT\r\n\r\nYou can find in a text whatever you bring, if you will stand between it\r\nand the mirror of your imagination. You may not see your ears, but they\r\nwill be there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNTING THE DECEITFUL TURKEY\r\n\r\nWhen I was a boy my uncle and his big boys hunted with the rifle, the\r\nyoungest boy Fred and I with a shotgun--a small single-barrelled shotgun\r\nwhich was properly suited to our size and strength; it was not much\r\nheavier than a broom. We carried it turn about, half an hour at a time.\r\nI was not able to hit anything with it, but I liked to try. Fred and\r\nI hunted feathered small game, the others hunted deer, squirrels, wild\r\nturkeys, and such things. My uncle and the big boys were good shots.\r\nThey killed hawks and wild geese and such like on the wing; and they\r\ndidn\'t wound or kill squirrels, they stunned them. When the dogs treed\r\na squirrel, the squirrel would scamper aloft and run out on a limb\r\nand flatten himself along it, hoping to make himself invisible in\r\nthat way--and not quite succeeding. You could see his wee little ears\r\nsticking up. You couldn\'t see his nose, but you knew where it was. Then\r\nthe hunter, despising a \xe2\x80\x9crest\xe2\x80\x9d for his rifle, stood up and took\r\noffhand aim at the limb and sent a bullet into it immediately under\r\nthe squirrel\'s nose, and down tumbled the animal, unwounded, but\r\nunconscious; the dogs gave him a shake and he was dead. Sometimes when\r\nthe distance was great and the wind not accurately allowed for, the\r\nbullet would hit the squirrel\'s head; the dogs could do as they pleased\r\nwith that one--the hunter\'s pride was hurt, and he wouldn\'t allow it to\r\ngo into the gamebag.\r\n\r\nIn the first faint gray of the dawn the stately wild turkeys would be\r\nstalking around in great flocks, and ready to be sociable and answer\r\ninvitations to come and converse with other excursionists of their kind.\r\nThe hunter concealed himself and imitated the turkey-call by sucking\r\nthe air through the leg-bone of a turkey which had previously answered\r\na call like that and lived only just long enough to regret it. There is\r\nnothing that furnishes a perfect turkey-call except that bone. Another\r\nof Nature\'s treacheries, you see. She is full of them; half the time she\r\ndoesn\'t know which she likes best--to betray her child or protect it.\r\nIn the case of the turkey she is badly mixed: she gives it a bone to be\r\nused in getting it into trouble, and she also furnishes it with a trick\r\nfor getting itself out of the trouble again. When a mamma-turkey answers\r\nan invitation and finds she has made a mistake in accepting it, she does\r\nas the mamma-partridge does--remembers a previous engagement--and goes\r\nlimping and scrambling away, pretending to be very lame; and at the same\r\ntime she is saying to her not-visible children, \xe2\x80\x9cLie low, keep still,\r\ndon\'t expose yourselves; I shall be back as soon as I have beguiled this\r\nshabby swindler out of the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen a person is ignorant and confiding, this immoral device can\r\nhave tiresome results. I followed an ostensibly lame turkey over a\r\nconsiderable part of the United States one morning, because I believed\r\nin her and could not think she would deceive a mere boy, and one who\r\nwas trusting her and considering her honest. I had the single-barrelled\r\nshotgun, but my idea was to catch her alive. I often got within rushing\r\ndistance of her, and then made my rush; but always, just as I made my\r\nfinal plunge and put my hand down where her back had been, it wasn\'t\r\nthere; it was only two or three inches from there and I brushed the\r\ntail-feathers as I landed on my stomach--a very close call, but still\r\nnot quite close enough; that is, not close enough for success, but just\r\nclose enough to convince me that I could do it next time. She always\r\nwaited for me, a little piece away, and let on to be resting and greatly\r\nfatigued; which was a lie, but I believed it, for I still thought her\r\nhonest long after I ought to have begun to doubt her, suspecting that\r\nthis was no way for a high-minded bird to be acting. I followed, and\r\nfollowed, and followed, making my periodical rushes, and getting up and\r\nbrushing the dust off, and resuming the voyage with patient confidence;\r\nindeed, with a confidence which grew, for I could see by the change of\r\nclimate and vegetation that we were getting up into the high latitudes,\r\nand as she always looked a little tireder and a little more discouraged\r\nafter each rush, I judged that I was safe to win, in the end, the\r\ncompetition being purely a matter of staying power and the advantage\r\nlying with me from the start because she was lame.\r\n\r\nAlong in the afternoon I began to feel fatigued myself. Neither of us\r\nhad had any rest since we first started on the excursion, which was\r\nupwards of ten hours before, though latterly we had paused awhile after\r\nrushes, I letting on to be thinking about something else; but neither of\r\nus sincere, and both of us waiting for the other to call game but in no\r\nreal hurry about it, for indeed those little evanescent snatches of rest\r\nwere very grateful to the feelings of us both; it would naturally be\r\nso, skirmishing along like that ever since dawn and not a bite in the\r\nmeantime; at least for me, though sometimes as she lay on her side\r\nfanning herself with a wing and praying for strength to get out of this\r\ndifficulty a grasshopper happened along whose time had come, and that\r\nwas well for her, and fortunate, but I had nothing--nothing the whole\r\nday.\r\n\r\nMore than once, after I was very tired, I gave up taking her alive, and\r\nwas going to shoot her, but I never did it, although it was my right,\r\nfor I did not believe I could hit her; and besides, she always stopped\r\nand posed, when I raised the gun, and this made me suspicious that\r\nshe knew about me and my marksmanship, and so I did not care to expose\r\nmyself to remarks.\r\n\r\nI did not get her, at all. When she got tired of the game at last, she\r\nrose from almost under my hand and flew aloft with the rush and whir\r\nof a shell and lit on the highest limb of a great tree and sat down and\r\ncrossed her legs and smiled down at me, and seemed gratified to see me\r\nso astonished.\r\n\r\nI was ashamed, and also lost; and it was while wandering the woods\r\nhunting for myself that I found a deserted log cabin and had one of\r\nthe best meals there that in my life-days I have eaten. The weed-grown\r\ngarden was full of ripe tomatoes, and I ate them ravenously, though I\r\nhad never liked them before. Not more than two or three times since have\r\nI tasted anything that was so delicious as those tomatoes. I surfeited\r\nmyself with them, and did not taste another one until I was in middle\r\nlife. I can eat them now, but I do not like the look of them. I suppose\r\nwe have all experienced a surfeit at one time or another. Once, in\r\nstress of circumstances, I ate part of a barrel of sardines, there being\r\nnothing else at hand, but since then I have always been able to get\r\nalong without sardines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE McWILLIAMSES AND THE BURGLAR ALARM\r\n\r\nThe conversation drifted smoothly and pleasantly along from weather\r\nto crops, from crops to literature, from literature to scandal, from\r\nscandal to religion; then took a random jump, and landed on the subject\r\nof burglar alarms. And now for the first time Mr. McWilliams showed\r\nfeeling. Whenever I perceive this sign on this man\'s dial, I comprehend\r\nit, and lapse into silence, and give him opportunity to unload his\r\nheart. Said he, with but ill-controlled emotion:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not go one single cent on burglar alarms, Mr. Twain--not a single\r\ncent--and I will tell you why. When we were finishing our house, we\r\nfound we had a little cash left over, on account of the plumber not\r\nknowing it. I was for enlightening the heathen with it, for I was always\r\nunaccountably down on the heathen somehow; but Mrs. McWilliams said no,\r\nlet\'s have a burglar alarm. I agreed to this compromise. I will explain\r\nthat whenever I want a thing, and Mrs. McWilliams wants another thing,\r\nand we decide upon the thing that Mrs. McWilliams wants--as we always\r\ndo--she calls that a compromise. Very well: the man came up from New\r\nYork and put in the alarm, and charged three hundred and twenty-five\r\ndollars for it, and said we could sleep without uneasiness now. So we\r\ndid for awhile--say a month. Then one night we smelled smoke, and I\r\nwas advised to get up and see what the matter was. I lit a candle, and\r\nstarted toward the stairs, and met a burglar coming out of a room with\r\na basket of tinware, which he had mistaken for solid silver in the dark.\r\nHe was smoking a pipe. I said, \'My friend, we do not allow smoking in\r\nthis room.\' He said he was a stranger, and could not be expected to know\r\nthe rules of the house: said he had been in many houses just as good as\r\nthis one, and it had never been objected to before. He added that as far\r\nas his experience went, such rules had never been considered to apply to\r\nburglars, anyway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said: \'Smoke along, then, if it is the custom, though I think that\r\nthe conceding of a privilege to a burglar which is denied to a bishop is\r\na conspicuous sign of the looseness of the times. But waiving all that,\r\nwhat business have you to be entering this house in this furtive and\r\nclandestine way, without ringing the burglar alarm?\'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe looked confused and ashamed, and said, with embarrassment: \'I beg a\r\nthousand pardons. I did not know you had a burglar alarm, else I would\r\nhave rung it. I beg you will not mention it where my parents may hear of\r\nit, for they are old and feeble, and such a seemingly wanton breach of\r\nthe hallowed conventionalities of our Christian civilization might all\r\ntoo rudely sunder the frail bridge which hangs darkling between the pale\r\nand evanescent present and the solemn great deeps of the eternities. May\r\nI trouble you for a match?\'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said: \'Your sentiments do you honor, but if you will allow me to say\r\nit, metaphor is not your best hold. Spare your thigh; this kind light\r\nonly on the box, and seldom there, in fact, if my experience may be\r\ntrusted. But to return to business: how did you get in here?\'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\'Through a second-story window.\'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was even so. I redeemed the tinware at pawnbroker\'s rates, less cost\r\nof advertising, bade the burglar good-night, closed the window after\r\nhim, and retired to headquarters to report. Next morning we sent for\r\nthe burglar-alarm man, and he came up and explained that the reason the\r\nalarm did not \'go off\' was that no part of the house but the first floor\r\nwas attached to the alarm. This was simply idiotic; one might as well\r\nhave no armor on at all in battle as to have it only on his legs.\r\nThe expert now put the whole second story on the alarm, charged three\r\nhundred dollars for it, and went his way. By and by, one night, I found\r\na burglar in the third story, about to start down a ladder with a lot\r\nof miscellaneous property. My first impulse was to crack his head with a\r\nbilliard cue; but my second was to refrain from this attention, because\r\nhe was between me and the cue rack. The second impulse was plainly the\r\nsoundest, so I refrained, and proceeded to compromise. I redeemed the\r\nproperty at former rates, after deducting ten per cent. for use of\r\nladder, it being my ladder, and, next day we sent down for the expert\r\nonce more, and had the third story attached to the alarm, for three\r\nhundred dollars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy this time the \'annunciator\' had grown to formidable dimensions. It\r\nhad forty-seven tags on it, marked with the names of the various rooms\r\nand chimneys, and it occupied the space of an ordinary wardrobe. The\r\ngong was the size of a wash-bowl, and was placed above the head of our\r\nbed. There was a wire from the house to the coachman\'s quarters in the\r\nstable, and a noble gong alongside his pillow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe should have been comfortable now but for one defect. Every morning\r\nat five the cook opened the kitchen door, in the way of business, and\r\nrip went that gong! The first time this happened I thought the last\r\nday was come sure. I didn\'t think it in bed--no, but out of it--for the\r\nfirst effect of that frightful gong is to hurl you across the house, and\r\nslam you against the wall, and then curl you up, and squirm you like a\r\nspider on a stove lid, till somebody shuts the kitchen door. In solid\r\nfact, there is no clamor that is even remotely comparable to the dire\r\nclamor which that gong makes. Well, this catastrophe happened every\r\nmorning regularly at five o\'clock, and lost us three hours sleep; for,\r\nmind you, when that thing wakes you, it doesn\'t merely wake you in\r\nspots; it wakes you all over, conscience and all, and you are good for\r\neighteen hours of wide-awakeness subsequently--eighteen hours of the\r\nvery most inconceivable wide-awakeness that you ever experienced in your\r\nlife. A stranger died on our hands one time, and we vacated and left him\r\nin our room overnight. Did that stranger wait for the general judgment?\r\nNo, sir; he got up at five the next morning in the most prompt and\r\nunostentatious way. I knew he would; I knew it mighty well. He collected\r\nhis life-insurance, and lived happy ever after, for there was plenty of\r\nproof as to the perfect squareness of his death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we were gradually fading toward a better land, on account of the\r\ndaily loss of sleep; so we finally had the expert up again, and he ran\r\na wire to the outside of the door, and placed a switch there, whereby\r\nThomas, the butler, always made one little mistake--he switched the\r\nalarm off at night when he went to bed, and switched it on again at\r\ndaybreak in the morning, just in time for the cook to open the kitchen\r\ndoor, and enable that gong to slam us across the house, sometimes\r\nbreaking a window with one or the other of us. At the end of a week we\r\nrecognized that this switch business was a delusion and a snare. We also\r\ndiscovered that a band of burglars had been lodging in the house the\r\nwhole time--not exactly to steal, for there wasn\'t much left now, but\r\nto hide from the police, for they were hot pressed, and they shrewdly\r\njudged that the detectives would never think of a tribe of burglars\r\ntaking sanctuary in a house notoriously protected by the most imposing\r\nand elaborate burglar alarm in America.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSent down for the expert again, and this time he struck a most dazzling\r\nidea--he fixed the thing so that opening the kitchen door would take\r\noff the alarm. It was a noble idea, and he charged accordingly. But\r\nyou already foresee the result. I switched on the alarm every night at\r\nbed-time, no longer trusting on Thomas\'s frail memory; and as soon as\r\nthe lights were out the burglars walked in at the kitchen door, thus\r\ntaking the alarm off without waiting for the cook to do it in the\r\nmorning. You see how aggravatingly we were situated. For months we\r\ncouldn\'t have any company. Not a spare bed in the house; all occupied by\r\nburglars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinally, I got up a cure of my own. The expert answered the call, and\r\nran another ground wire to the stable, and established a switch there,\r\nso that the coachman could put on and take off the alarm. That worked\r\nfirst rate, and a season of peace ensued, during which we got to\r\ninviting company once more and enjoying life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut by and by the irrepressible alarm invented a new kink. One winter\'s\r\nnight we were flung out of bed by the sudden music of that awful gong,\r\nand when we hobbled to the annunciator, turned up the gas, and saw the\r\nword \'Nursery\' exposed, Mrs. McWilliams fainted dead away, and I came\r\nprecious near doing the same thing myself. I seized my shotgun, and\r\nstood timing the coachman whilst that appalling buzzing went on. I knew\r\nthat his gong had flung him out, too, and that he would be along with\r\nhis gun as soon as he could jump into his clothes. When I judged that\r\nthe time was ripe, I crept to the room next the nursery, glanced through\r\nthe window, and saw the dim outline of the coachman in the yard below,\r\nstanding at present-arms and waiting for a chance. Then I hopped into\r\nthe nursery and fired, and in the same instant the coachman fired at the\r\nred flash of my gun. Both of us were successful; I crippled a nurse, and\r\nhe shot off all my back hair. We turned up the gas, and telephoned for\r\na surgeon. There was not a sign of a burglar, and no window had been\r\nraised. One glass was absent, but that was where the coachman\'s charge\r\nhad come through. Here was a fine mystery--a burglar alarm \'going off\'\r\nat midnight of its own accord, and not a burglar in the neighborhood!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe expert answered the usual call, and explained that it was a \'False\r\nalarm.\' Said it was easily fixed. So he overhauled the nursery window,\r\ncharged a remunerative figure for it, and departed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat we suffered from false alarms for the next three years no\r\nstylographic pen can describe. During the next three months I always\r\nflew with my gun to the room indicated, and the coachman always sallied\r\nforth with his battery to support me. But there was never anything to\r\nshoot at--windows all tight and secure. We always sent down for the\r\nexpert next day, and he fixed those particular windows so they would\r\nkeep quiet a week or so, and always remembered to send us a bill about\r\nlike this:\r\n\r\n          Wire ............................$2.15\r\n          Nipple...........................  .75\r\n          Two hours\xe2\x80\x99 labor ................ 1.50\r\n          Wax..............................  .47\r\n          Tape.............................  .34\r\n          Screws...........................  .15\r\n          Recharging battery ..............  .98\r\n          Three hours\xe2\x80\x99 labor .............. 2.25\r\n          String...........................  .02\r\n          Lard ............................  .66\r\n          Pond\'s Extract .................. 1.25\r\n          Springs at 50.................... 2.00\r\n          Railroad fares................... 7.25\r\n                                             \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n                                           19.77\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt length a perfectly natural thing came about--after we had answered\r\nthree or four hundred false alarms--to wit, we stopped answering them.\r\nYes, I simply rose up calmly, when slammed across the house by\r\nthe alarm, calmly inspected the annunciator, took note of the room\r\nindicated; and then calmly disconnected that room from the alarm, and\r\nwent back to bed as if nothing had happened. Moreover, I left that room\r\noff permanently, and did not send for the expert. Well, it goes without\r\nsaying that in the course of time all the rooms were taken off, and the\r\nentire machine was out of service.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was at this unprotected time that the heaviest calamity of all\r\nhappened. The burglars walked in one night and carried off the burglar\r\nalarm! yes, sir, every hide and hair of it: ripped it out, tooth and\r\nnail; springs, bells, gongs, battery, and all; they took a hundred and\r\nfifty miles of copper wire; they just cleaned her out, bag and baggage,\r\nand never left us a vestige of her to swear at--swear by, I mean.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had a time of it to get her back; but we accomplished it finally,\r\nfor money. The alarm firm said that what we needed now was to have her\r\nput in right--with their new patent springs in the windows to make false\r\nalarms impossible, and their new patent clock attached to take off and\r\nput on the alarm morning and night without human assistance. That seemed\r\na good scheme. They promised to have the whole thing finished in ten\r\ndays. They began work, and we left for the summer. They worked a couple\r\nof days; then they left for the summer. After which the burglars moved\r\nin, and began their summer vacation. When we returned in the fall, the\r\nhouse was as empty as a beer closet in premises where painters have been\r\nat work. We refurnished, and then sent down to hurry up the expert. He\r\ncame up and finished the job, and said: \'Now this clock is set to put on\r\nthe alarm every night at 10, and take it off every morning at 5:45.\r\nAll you\'ve got to do is to wind her up every week, and then leave her\r\nalone--she will take care of the alarm herself.\'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter that we had a most tranquil season during three months. The bill\r\nwas prodigious, of course, and I had said I would not pay it until the\r\nnew machinery had proved itself to be flawless. The time stipulated was\r\nthree months. So I paid the bill, and the very next day the alarm went\r\nto buzzing like ten thousand bee swarms at ten o\'clock in the morning.\r\nI turned the hands around twelve hours, according to instructions, and\r\nthis took off the alarm; but there was another hitch at night, and I had\r\nto set her ahead twelve hours once more to get her to put the alarm on\r\nagain. That sort of nonsense went on a week or two, then the expert came\r\nup and put in a new clock. He came up every three months during the next\r\nthree years, and put in a new clock. But it was always a failure. His\r\nclocks all had the same perverse defect: they would put the alarm on in\r\nthe daytime, and they would not put it on at night; and if you forced\r\nit on yourself, they would take it off again the minute your back was\r\nturned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow there is the history of that burglar alarm--everything just as\r\nit happened; nothing extenuated, and naught set down in malice. Yes,\r\nsir,--and when I had slept nine years with burglars, and maintained an\r\nexpensive burglar alarm the whole time, for their protection, not mine,\r\nand at my sole cost--for not a d---d cent could I ever get THEM to\r\ncontribute--I just said to Mrs. McWilliams that I had had enough of that\r\nkind of pie; so with her full consent I took the whole thing out and\r\ntraded it off for a dog, and shot the dog. I don\'t know what you think\r\nabout it, Mr. Twain; but I think those things are made solely in the\r\ninterest of the burglars. Yes, sir, a burglar alarm combines in its\r\nperson all that is objectionable about a fire, a riot, and a harem, and\r\nat the same time had none of the compensating advantages, of one sort or\r\nanother, that customarily belong with that combination. Good-by: I get\r\noff here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
