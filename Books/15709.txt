"Of course I would not see\r\nhim," she said, pursing her lips into a hard line. "Certainly not!"\r\n\r\nA bump on the library door, as from an opposing knee, did duty for a knock.\r\n\r\n"Bring the box in here, Norah," said Miss Terry, holding open the door for\r\nher servant, who was gasping under the weight of a packing-case. "Set it\r\ndown on the rug by the fire-place. I am going to look it over and burn up\r\nthe rubbish this evening."\r\n\r\nShe glanced once more at the letter in her hand, then with a sniff tossed\r\nit upon the fire.\r\n\r\n"Yes\'m," said Norah, as she set down the box with a thump. She stooped once\r\nmore to pick up something which had fallen out when the cover was jarred\r\nopen. It was a pink papier-mache angel, such as are often hung from the top\r\nof Christmas trees as a crowning symbol. Norah stood holding it between\r\nthumb and finger, staring amazedly. Who would think to find such a bit of\r\nfrivolity in the house of Miss Terry!\r\n\r\nHer mistress looked up from the fire, where the bit of writing was writhing\r\npainfully, and caught the expression of Norah\'s face.\r\n\r\n"What have you there?" she asked, frowning, as she took the object into her\r\nown hands. "The Christmas Angel!" she exclaimed under her breath. "I had\r\nquite forgotten it." Then as if it burned her fingers she thrust the little\r\nimage back into the box and turned to Norah brusquely. "There, that\'s all.\r\nYou can go now, Norah," she said.\r\n\r\n"Yes\'m," answered the maid. She hesitated. "If you please\'m, it\'s Christmas\r\nEve."\r\n\r\n"Well, I believe so," snapped Miss Terry, who seemed to be in a\r\nparticularly bad humor this evening. "What do you want?"\r\n\r\nNorah flushed; but she was hardened to her mistress\'s manner. "Only to ask\r\nif I may go out for a little while to see the decorations and hear the\r\nsinging."\r\n\r\n"Decorations? Singing? Fiddlestick!" retorted Miss Terry, poker in hand.\r\n"What decorations? What singing?"\r\n\r\n"Why, all the windows along the street are full of candles," answered\r\nNorah; "rows of candles in every house, to light the Christ Child on his\r\nway when he comes through the city to-night."\r\n\r\n"Fiddlestick!" again snarled her mistress.\r\n\r\n"And choir-boys are going about the streets, they say, singing carols in\r\nfront of the lighted houses," continued Norah enthusiastically. "It must\r\nsound so pretty!"\r\n\r\n"They had much better be at home in bed. I believe people are losing their\r\nminds!"\r\n\r\n"Please\'m, may I go?" asked Norah again.\r\n\r\nNorah had no puritanic traditions to her account. Moreover she was young\r\nand warm and enthusiastic. Sometimes the spell of Miss Terry\'s sombre house\r\nthreatened her to the point of desperation. It was so this Christmas Eve;\r\nbut she made her request with apparent calmness.\r\n\r\n"Yes, go along," assented her mistress ungraciously.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, \'m," said the servant demurely, but with a brightening of her\r\nblue eyes. And presently the area door banged behind her quick-retreating\r\nfootsteps.\r\n\r\n"H\'m! Didn\'t take her long to get ready!" muttered Miss Terry, giving the\r\nfire a vicious poke. She was alone in the house, on Christmas Eve, and not\r\na man, woman, or child in the world cared. Well, it was what she wanted. It\r\nwas of her own doing. If she had wished--\r\n\r\nShe sat back in her chair, with thin, long hands lying along the arms of\r\nit, gazing into the fire. A bit of paper there was crumbling into ashes.\r\nAlone on Christmas Eve! Even Norah had some relation with the world\r\noutside. Was there not a stalwart officer waiting for her on the nearest\r\ncorner? Even Norah could feel a simple childish pleasure in candles and\r\ncarols and merriment, and the old, old superstition.\r\n\r\n"Stuff and nonsense!" mused Miss Terry scornfully. "What is our Christmas,\r\nanyway? A time for shopkeepers to sell and for foolish folks to kill\r\nthemselves in buying. Christmas spirit? No! It is all humbug,--all\r\nselfishness, and worry; an unwholesome season of unnatural activities. I am\r\nglad I am out of it. I am glad no one expects anything of me,--nor I of any\r\none. I am quite independent; blessedly independent of the whole foolish\r\nbusiness. It is a good time to begin clearing up for the new year. I\'m glad\r\nI thought of it. I\'ve long threatened to get rid of the stuff that has\r\nbeen accumulating in that corner of the attic. Now I will begin."\r\n\r\nShe tugged the packing-case an inch nearer the fire. It was like Miss Terry\r\nto insist upon that nearer inch. Then she raised the cover. It was a box\r\nfull of children\'s battered toys, old-fashioned and quaint; the toys in\r\nvogue thirty--forty--fifty years earlier, when Miss Terry was a child. She\r\ngave a reminiscent sniff as she threw up the cover and saw on the under\r\nside of it a big label of pasteboard unevenly lettered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAY BOX OF TOM TERRY AND ANGELINA TERRY (scrawl)]\r\n\r\n"Humph!" she snorted. There was a great deal in that "humph." It meant:\r\nYes, Tom\'s name had plenty of room, while poor little Angelina had to\r\nsqueeze in as well as she could. How like Tom! This accounted for\r\neverything, even to his not being in his sister\'s house this very night.\r\nHow unreasonable he had been!\r\n\r\nMiss Terry shrugged impatiently. Why think of Tom to-night? Years ago he\r\nhad deliberately cut himself adrift from her interests. No need to think of\r\nhim now. It was too late to appease her. But here were all these toys to be\r\ngot rid of. The fire was hungry for them. Why not begin?\r\n\r\nMiss Terry stooped to poke over the contents of the box with lean, long\r\nfingers. In one corner thrust up a doll\'s arm; in another, an animal\'s tail\r\npointed heavenward. She caught glimpses of glitter and tinsel, wheels and\r\nfragments of unidentifiable toys.\r\n\r\n"What rubbish!" she said. "Yes, I\'ll burn them all. They are good for\r\nnothing else. I suppose some folks would try to give them away, and bore a\r\nlot of people to death. They seem to think they are saving something, that\r\nway. Nonsense! I know better. It is all foolishness, this craze for giving.\r\nMost things are better destroyed as soon as you are done with them. Why,\r\nnobody wants such truck as this. Now, could any child ever have cared for\r\nso silly a thing?" She pulled out a faded jumping-jack, and regarded it\r\nscornfully. "Idiotic! Such toys are demoralizing for children--weaken their\r\nminds. It is a shame to think how every one seems bound to spoil children,\r\nespecially at Christmas time. Well, no one can say that I have added to the\r\nshameful waste."\r\n\r\nMiss Terry tossed the poor jumping-jack on the fire, and eyed his last\r\ncontortions with grim satisfaction.\r\n\r\nBut as she watched, a quaint idea came to her. She was famous for eccentric\r\nideas.\r\n\r\n"I will try an experiment," she said. "I will prove once for all my point\r\nabout the \'Christmas spirit.\' I will drop some of these old toys out on the\r\nsidewalk and see what happens. It may be interesting."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nJACK-IN-THE-BOX\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Terry rose and crossed two rooms to the front window, looking out upon\r\nthe street. A flare of light almost blinded her eyes. Every window opposite\r\nher along the block, as far as she could see, was illuminated with a row of\r\nlighted candles across the sash. The soft, unusual glow threw into relief\r\nthe pretty curtains and wreaths of green, and gave glimpses of cosy\r\ninteriors and flitting happy figures.\r\n\r\n"What a waste of candles!" scolded Miss Terry. "Folks are growing terribly\r\nextravagant."\r\n\r\nThe street was white with snow which had fallen a few hours earlier, piled\r\nin drifts along the curb of the little-traveled terrace. But the sidewalks\r\nwere neatly shoveled and swept clean, as became the eminently respectable\r\npart of the city where Miss Terry lived. A long flight of steps, with iron\r\nrailing at the side, led down from the front door, upon which a silver\r\nplate had for generations in decorous flourishes announced the name of\r\nTerry.\r\n\r\nMiss Terry returned to the play box and drew out between thumb and finger\r\nthe topmost toy. It happened to be a wooden box, with a wire hasp for\r\nfastening the cover. Half unconsciously she pressed the spring, and a\r\nhideous Jack-in-the-box sprang out to confront her with a squeak, a leering\r\nsmile, and a red nose. Miss Terry eyed him with disfavor.\r\n\r\n"I always did hate that thing," she said. "Tom was continually frightening\r\nme with it, I remember." As if to be rid of unwelcome memories she shut her\r\nmouth tight, even as she shut Jack back into his box, snapping the spring\r\ninto place. "This will do to begin with," she thought. She crossed to the\r\nwindow, which she opened quickly, and tossed out the box, so that it fell\r\nsquarely in the middle of the sidewalk. Then closing the window and turning\r\ndown the lights in the room behind her, Miss Terry hid in the folds of the\r\ncurtain and watched to see what would happen to Jack.\r\n\r\nThe street was quiet. Few persons passed on either side. At last she spied\r\ntwo little ragamuffins approaching. They seemed to be Jewish lads of the\r\nnewsboy class, and they eyed the display of candles appraisingly. The\r\nsmaller boy first caught sight of the box in the middle of the sidewalk.\r\n\r\n"Hello! Wot\'s dis?" he grunted, making a dash upon it.\r\n\r\n"Gee! Wot\'s up?" responded the other, who was instantly at his elbow.\r\n\r\n"Gwan! Lemme look at it."\r\n\r\nThe smaller boy drew away and pressed the spring of the box eagerly.\r\n_Ping!_ Out popped the Jack into his astonished face; whereupon he set up a\r\nguffaw.\r\n\r\n"Give it here!" commanded the bigger boy.\r\n\r\n"Naw! You let it alone! It\'s mine!" asserted the other, edging away along\r\nthe curbstone. "I saw it first. You can\'t have it."\r\n\r\n"Give it here. I saw it first myself. Hand it over, or I\'ll smash you!"\r\n\r\nThe bigger boy advanced threateningly.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t!" the other whimpered, clasping the box tightly under his jacket.\r\n\r\nHe started to run, but the bigger fellow was too quick for him. He pounced\r\nacross the sidewalk, and soon the twain were struggling in the snowdrift,\r\npummeling one another with might and main.\r\n\r\n"I told you so!" commented Miss Terry from behind the curtain. "Here\'s the\r\nfirst show of the beautiful Christmas spirit that is supposed to be abroad.\r\nLook at the little beasts fighting over something that neither of them\r\nreally wants!"\r\n\r\nJust then Miss Terry spied a blue-coated figure leisurely approaching. At\r\nthe same moment an instinct seemed to warn the struggling urchins.\r\n\r\n"Cop!" said a muffled voice from the pile of arms and legs, and in an\r\ninstant two black shadows were flitting down the street; but not before the\r\nbigger boy had wrenched the box from the pocket of the little chap.\r\n\r\n"So that is the end of experiment number one," quoth Miss Terry, smiling\r\ngrimly. "It happened just about as I expected. They will be fighting again\r\nas soon as they are out of sight. They are Jews; but that doesn\'t make any\r\ndifference about the Christmas spirit. Now let\'s see what becomes of the\r\nnext experiment."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE FLANTON DOG\r\n\r\n\r\nShe returned to the play box by the fire, and rummaged for a few minutes\r\namong the tangled toys. Then with something like a chuckle she drew out a\r\nsoft, pale creature with four wobbly legs.\r\n\r\n"The Flanton Dog!" she said. "Well, I vow! I had forgotten all about him.\r\nIt was Tom who coined the name for him because he was made of Canton\r\nflannel."\r\n\r\nShe stood the thing up on the table as well as his weak legs would allow,\r\nand inspected him critically. He certainly was a forlorn specimen. One of\r\nthe black beads which had served him for eyes was gone. His ears, which had\r\noriginally stood up saucily on his head, now drooped in limp dejection. One\r\nof them was a mere shapeless rag hanging by a thread. He was dirty and\r\ndiscolored, and his tail was gone. But still he smiled with his red-thread\r\nmouth and seemed trying to make the best of things.\r\n\r\n"What a nightmare!" said Miss Terry contemptuously. "I know there isn\'t a\r\nchild in the city who wants such a looking thing. Why, even the Animal\r\nRescue folks would give the boys a \'free shot\' at that. This isn\'t going to\r\nbring out any Christmas spirit," she sneered. "I will try it and see."\r\n\r\nOnce more she lifted the window and tossed the dog to the sidewalk. He\r\nrolled upon his back and lay pathetically with crooked legs yearning\r\nupward, still smiling. Hardly had Miss Terry time to conceal herself behind\r\nthe curtain when she saw a figure approaching, airily waving a stick.\r\n\r\n"No ragamuffin this time," she said. "Hello! It is that good-for-nothing\r\nyoung Cooper fellow from the next block. They say he is a millionaire.\r\nWell, he isn\'t even going to see the Flanton Dog."\r\n\r\nThe young man came swinging along, debonairly; he was whistling under his\r\nbreath. He was a dapper figure in a long coat and a silk hat, under which\r\nthe candles lighted a rather silly face. When he reached the spot in the\r\nsidewalk where the Flanton Dog lay, he paused a moment looking down. Then\r\nhe poked the object with his stick. On the other side of the street a\r\nmother and her little boy were passing at the time. The child\'s eyes caught\r\nsight of the dog on the sidewalk, and he hung back, watching to see what\r\nthe young man would do to it. But his mother drew him after her. Just then\r\nan automobile came panting through the snow. With a quick movement Cooper\r\npicked up the dog on the end of his stick and tossed it into the street,\r\nunder the wheels of the machine. The baby across the street uttered a howl\r\nof anguish at the sight. Miss Terry herself was surprised to feel a pang\r\nshoot through her as the car passed over the queer old toy. She retreated\r\nfrom the window quickly.\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s the end of Flanton," she said with half a sigh. "I knew that\r\nfellow was a brute. I might have expected something like that. But it\r\nlooked so--so--" She hesitated for a word, and did not finish her sentence,\r\nbut bit her lip and sniffed cynically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE NOAH\'S ARK\r\n\r\n\r\n"Now, what comes next?" Miss Terry rummaged in the box until her fingers\r\nmet something odd-shaped, long, and smooth-sided. With some difficulty she\r\ndrew out the object, for it was of good size.\r\n\r\n"H\'m! The old Noah\'s ark," she said. "I wonder if all the animals are in\r\nthere."\r\n\r\nShe lifted the cover, and turned out into her lap the long-imprisoned\r\nanimals and their round-bodied chief. Mrs. Noah and her sons had long since\r\ndisappeared. But the ark-builder, hatless and one-armed, still presided\r\nover a menagerie of sorry beasts. Scarcely one could boast of being a\r\nquadruped. To few of them the years had spared a tail. From their close\r\nresemblance in their misery, it was not hard to believe in the kinship of\r\nall animal life. She took them up and examined them curiously one by one.\r\nFinally she selected a shapeless slate-colored block from the mass. "This\r\nwas the elephant," she mused. "I remember when Tom stepped on him and\r\nsmashed his trunk. \'I guess I\'m going to be an expressman when I grow up,\'\r\nhe said, looking sorry. Tom was always full of his jokes. Now I\'ll try this\r\nand see what happens to the ark on its last voyage."\r\n\r\nJust then there was a noise outside. An automobile honked past, and Miss\r\nTerry shuddered, recalling the pathetic end of the Flanton Dog, which had\r\ngiven her quite a turn.\r\n\r\n"I hate those horrid machines!" she exclaimed. "They seem like Juggernaut.\r\nI\'d like to forbid their going through this street."\r\n\r\nShe crowded the elephant with Noah and the rest of his charge back into the\r\nark and closed the lid. "I can\'t throw this out of the window," she\r\nreflected. "They would spill. I must take it out on the sidewalk. Land! The\r\nfire\'s going out! That girl doesn\'t know how to build fires so they will\r\nkeep."\r\n\r\nShe laid the Noah\'s ark on the table, and going to the closet tugged out\r\nseveral big logs, which she arranged geometrically. About laying fires, as\r\nabout most other things, Miss Terry had her own positive theories. Taking\r\nthe bellows in hand she blew furiously, and was presently rewarded with a\r\nbrisk blaze. She smiled with satisfaction, and trotted upstairs to find her\r\nred knit shawl. With this about her shoulders she was prepared to brave the\r\nDecember frost. Down the steps she went, and deposited the ark discreetly\r\nat their foot; then returned to take up her position behind the curtains.\r\n\r\nThere were a good many people passing, but they seemed too preoccupied to\r\nglance down at the sidewalk. They were nearly all hurrying in one\r\ndirection. Some were running in the middle of the street.\r\n\r\n"They are in a great hurry," sniffed Miss Terry disdainfully. "One would\r\nthink they had something really important on hand. I suppose they are going\r\nto hear the singing. Fiddlestick!"\r\n\r\nA man hastened by under the window; a woman; two children, a boy and a\r\ngirl, running and gesticulating eagerly. None of them noticed the Noah\'s\r\nark lying at the foot of the steps.\r\n\r\nMiss Terry began to grow impatient. "Are they all blind?" she fretted.\r\n"What is the matter with them? I wish somebody would find the thing. I am\r\ntired of seeing it lying there."\r\n\r\nShe tapped the floor impatiently with her slipper. Just then a woman\r\napproached. She was dressed in the most uncompromising of mourning, and she\r\nwalked slowly, with bent head, never glancing at the lighted windows on\r\neither side.\r\n\r\n"She will see it," commented Miss Terry. And sure enough, she did. She\r\nstopped at the doorstep, drew her skirts aside, and bent over to look at\r\nthe strange-shaped box at her feet. Finally she lifted it But immediately\r\nshe shivered and acted so strangely that Miss Terry thought she was about\r\nto break the toy in pieces on the steps or throw it into the street.\r\nEvidently she detested the sight of it.\r\n\r\nJust then up came a second woman with two small boys hanging at her skirts.\r\nThey were ragged and sick-looking. There was something about the expression\r\nof even the tiny knot of hair at the back of the woman\'s head which told of\r\nanxious poverty. With envious curiosity she hurried up to see what a\r\nluckier mortal had found, crowding to look over her shoulder. The woman in\r\nblack drew haughtily away and clutched the Noah\'s ark with a gesture of\r\nproprietorship.\r\n\r\n"Go away! This is my affair." Miss Terry read her expression and sniffed.\r\n"There is the Christmas spirit coming out again," she said to herself.\r\n"Look at her face!"\r\n\r\nThe black-gowned woman prepared to move on with the toy under her arm. But\r\nthe second woman caught hold of her skirt and began to speak earnestly. She\r\npointed to the Noah\'s ark, then to her two children. Her eyes were\r\nbeseeching. The little boys crowded forward eagerly. But some wicked\r\nspirit seemed to have seized the finder of the ark. Angrily she shook off\r\nthe hand of the other woman, and clutching the box yet more firmly under\r\nher arm, she hurried away. Once, twice, she turned and shook her head at\r\nthe ragged woman who followed her. Then, with a savage gesture at the two\r\nchildren, she disappeared beyond Miss Terry\'s straining eyes. The poor\r\nwoman and her boys followed forlornly at a distance.\r\n\r\n"They really wanted it, that old Noah\'s ark!" exclaimed Miss Terry in\r\namazement. "I can scarcely believe it. But why did that other creature keep\r\nthe thing? I see! Only because she found they cared for it. Well, that is a\r\nhappy spirit for Christmas time, I should say! Humph! I did not expect to\r\nfind anything quite so mean as _that!_"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nMIRANDA\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Terry returned to the fireside, fumbled in the box, and drew out a\r\ndoll. She was an ugly, old-fashioned doll, with bruised waxen face of no\r\nparticular color. Her mop of flaxen hair was straggling and uneven, much\r\nthe worse for the attention of generations of moths. She wore a faded green\r\nsilk dress in the style of Lincoln\'s day, and a primitive bonnet, evidently\r\nmade by childish hands. She was a strange, dead-looking figure, with pale\r\neyelids closed, as Miss Terry dragged her from the box. But when she was\r\nset upright the lids snapped open and a pair of bright blue eyes looked\r\nstraight into those of Miss Terry. It was so sudden that the lady nearly\r\ngasped.\r\n\r\n"Miranda!" she exclaimed. "It is old Miranda! I have not thought of her for\r\nyears." She held the doll at arm\'s length, gazing fixedly at her for some\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n"I cannot burn her," she muttered at last. "It would seem almost like\r\nmurder. I don\'t like to throw her away, but I have vowed to get rid of\r\nthese things to-night. And I\'ll do it, anyway. Yes, I\'ll make an experiment\r\nof her. I wonder what sort of trouble she will cause."\r\n\r\nNot even Miss Terry could think of seeing old Miranda lying exposed to the\r\nwinter night. She found a piece of paper, rolled up the doll in a neat\r\npackage, and tied it with red string. It was, to look upon, entirely a\r\ntempting package. Once more she stole down the steps and hesitated where to\r\nleave Miranda: not on the sidewalk,--for some reason that seemed\r\nimpossible. But near the foot of the flight of steps leading to the front\r\ndoor she deposited the doll. The white package shone out plainly in the\r\nilluminated street. There was no doubt that it would be readily seen.\r\n\r\nWith a quite unexplainable interest Miss Terry watched to see what would\r\nhappen to Miranda. She waited for some time. The street seemed deserted.\r\nMiss Terry caught the faint sound of singing. The choristers were passing\r\nthrough a neighboring street, and doubtless all wayfarers within hearing of\r\ntheir voices were following in their wake.\r\n\r\nShe was thoroughly interested in her grim joke, but she was becoming\r\nimpatient. Were there to be no more passers? Must the doll stay there\r\nunreclaimed until morning? Presently she became aware of a child\'s figure\r\ndrawing near. It was a little girl of about ten, very shabbily dressed,\r\nwith tangled yellow curls hanging over her shoulders. There was something\r\nfamiliar about her appearance, Miss Terry could not say what it was. She\r\ncame hurrying along the sidewalk with a preoccupied air, and seemed about\r\nto pass the steps without seeing the package lying there. But just as she\r\nwas opposite the window, her eye caught the gleam of the white paper. She\r\npaused. She looked at it eagerly; it was such a tempting package, both as\r\nto its size and shape! She went closer and bent down to examine it. She\r\ntook it into her bare little hands and seemed to squeeze it gently. There\r\nis no mistaking the contours of a doll, however well it may be enveloped in\r\npaper wrappings. The child\'s eyes grew more and more eager. She glanced\r\nbehind her furtively; she looked up and down the street. Then with a sudden\r\nintuition she looked straight ahead, up the flight of steps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHE LOOKED UP AND DOWN THE STREET]\r\n\r\nMiss Terry read her mind accurately. She was thinking that probably the\r\ndoll belonged in that house; some one must have dropped the package while\r\ngoing out or in. Would she ring the bell and return it? Miss Terry had\r\nnot thought of that possibility. But she shook her head and her lip curled.\r\n"Return it? Of course not! Ragged children do not usually return promising\r\npackages which they have found,--even on Christmas Eve. Look now!"\r\n\r\nOnce more the child glanced stealthily behind her, up and down the street.\r\nOnce more she looked up at the dark house before her, the only black spot\r\nin a wreath of brilliancy. She did not see the face peering at her through\r\nthe curtains, a face which scanned her own half wistfully. What was to\r\nbecome of Miranda? The little girl thrust the package under her ragged coat\r\nand ran away down the street as fast as her legs could take her.\r\n\r\n"A thief!" cried Miss Terry. "That is the climax. I have detected a child\r\ntaking what she knew did not belong to her, on Christmas Eve! Where are all\r\ntheir Sunday School lessons and their social improvement classes? I knew\r\nit! This Christmas spirit that one hears so much about is nothing but an\r\nempty sham. I have proved it to my satisfaction to-night. I will burn the\r\nrest of these toys, every one of them, and then go to bed. It is too\r\ndisgusting! She was a nice-looking child, too. Poor old Miranda!"\r\n\r\nWith something like a sigh Miss Terry strode back to the fire, where the\r\nplay box stood gaping. She had made but a small inroad upon its heaped-up\r\ntreasures. She threw herself listlessly into the chair and began to pull\r\nover the things. Broken games and animals, dolls\' dresses painfully\r\ntailored by unskilled fingers, disjointed members,--sorry relics of past\r\npleasures,--one by one Miss Terry seized them between disdainful thumb and\r\nfinger and tossed them into the fire. Her face showed not a qualm at\r\nparting with these childhood treasures; only the stern sense of a good\r\nhousekeeper\'s duty fulfilled. With queer contortions the bits writhed on\r\nthe coals, and finally flared into dissolution, vanishing up chimney in a\r\nshower of sparks to the heaven of spent toys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTMAS ANGEL\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost at the bottom of the box Miss Terry\'s fingers closed about a small\r\nobject. Once more she drew out the papier-mache Angel which had so excited\r\nthe wonder of Norah when once before that evening it had come to light.\r\n\r\nMiss Terry held it up and looked at it with the same expression on her\r\nface, half tender, half contemptuous. "The Christmas Angel!" she murmured\r\ninvoluntarily, as she had done before. And again there flashed through her\r\nmind a vivid picture.\r\n\r\nIt was the day before Christmas, fifty years earlier. She and her brother\r\nTom were trimming the Christmas tree in this very library. She saw Tom, in\r\na white pique suit with short socks that were always slipping down his fat\r\nlegs. She saw herself in a white dress and blue ribbons, pouting in a\r\ncorner. They had been quarreling about the Christmas tree, disputing as to\r\nwhich of them should light the first candle when the time arrived. Then\r\ntheir mother came to them smiling, a sweet-faced lady who seemed not to\r\nnotice the red faces and the tears. She put something into Tom\'s hand\r\nsaying, "This is the Christmas Angel of peace and good-will. Hang it on the\r\ntree, children, so that it may shed a blessing on all who come here to give\r\nand to receive."\r\n\r\nHow lovely and pink it looked in Tom\'s hand! Little Angelina had thought it\r\nthe most beautiful thing she had ever seen,--and holy, too, as if it had\r\nsome blessed charm. Fiddlestick! What queer fancies children have! Miss\r\nTerry remembered how a strange thrill had crept through Angelina as she\r\ngazed at it. Then she and Tom looked at each other and were ashamed of\r\ntheir quarrel. Suddenly Tom held out the Angel to his sister. "You hang it\r\non the tree, Angelina," he said magnanimously. "I know you want to."\r\n\r\nBut she--little fool!--she too had a fit of generosity.\r\n\r\n"No, you hang it, Tom. You\'re taller," she said.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll hang it at the very top of the tree!" he replied, nothing loath.\r\nEagerly he mounted the step-ladder, while Angelina watched him enviously,\r\nthinking how clumsy he was, and how much better she could do it.\r\n\r\nHow funny and fat Tom had looked on top of the ladder, reaching as high as\r\nhe dared! The ladder began to wobble, and he balanced precariously, while\r\nAngelina clutched at his fat ankles with a scream of fright. But Tom\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n"Ow! Angelina, let go my ankles! You hurt! Now don\'t scream. I shan\'t fall.\r\nDon\'t you know that this is the Christmas Angel, and he will never let me\r\nget hurt on Christmas Eve?"\r\n\r\nSwaying wildly on one toe Tom had clutched at the air, at the tree\r\nitself,--anywhere for support. Yet, almost as if by a miracle, he did not\r\nfall. And the Christmas Angel was looking down from the very top of the\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nMiss Terry laid the little pink figure in her lap and mused. "Mother was\r\nwise!" she sighed. "She knew how to settle our quarrels in those days.\r\nPerhaps if she had still been here things would have gone differently. Tom\r\nmight not have left me for good. _For good._" She emphasized the words with\r\na nod as if arguing against something.\r\n\r\nAgain she took up the Christmas Angel and looked earnestly at it. Could it\r\nbe that tears were glistening in her eyes? Certainly not! With a sudden\r\nsniff and jerk of the shoulders she leaned forward, holding the Angel\r\ntowards the fire. This should follow the other useless toys. But something\r\nseemed to stay her hand. She drew back, hesitated, then rose to her feet.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t burn it," she said. "It\'s no use, I can\'t burn it. But I don\'t\r\nwant to see the thing around. I will put this out on the sidewalk, too.\r\nPossibly this may be different and do some good to somebody."\r\n\r\nShe wrapped the shawl about her shoulders and once more ran down the steps.\r\nShe left the Angel face upward in the middle of the sidewalk, and retreated\r\nquickly to the house. As she opened the door to enter, she caught the\r\ndistant chorus of fresh young voices singing in a neighboring square:--\r\n\r\n    "Angels from the realms of glory,\r\n    Wing your flight o\'er all the earth."\r\n\r\nWhen she took her place behind the curtain she was trembling a little, she\r\ncould not guess why. But now she watched with renewed eagerness. What was\r\nto be the fate of the Christmas Angel? Would he fall into the right hands\r\nand be hung upon some Christmas tree ere morning? Would he--\r\n\r\nMiss Terry held her breath. A man was staggering along the street toward\r\nher. He whistled noisily a vulgar song, as he reeled from curb to railing,\r\nthreatening to fall at every step. A drunken man on Christmas Eve! Miss\r\nTerry felt a great loathing for him. He was at the foot of the steps now.\r\nHe was close upon the Angel. Would he see it, or would he tread upon it in\r\nhis disgusting blindness?\r\n\r\nYes--no! He saw the little pink image lying on the bricks, and with a lurch\r\nforward bent to examine it. Miss Terry flattened her nose against the pane\r\neagerly. She expected to see him fall upon the Angel bodily. But no; he\r\nrighted himself with a whoop of drunken mirth.\r\n\r\n"Angel!" she heard him croak with maudlin accent. "Pink Angel, begorrah!\r\nWhat doin\' \'ere, eh? Whoop! Go back to sky, Angel!" and lifting a brutal\r\nfoot he kicked the image into the street. Then with a shriek of laughter he\r\nstaggered away out of sight.\r\n\r\nMiss Terry found herself trembling with indignation. The idea! He had\r\nkicked the Christmas Angel,--the very Angel that Tom had hung on their\r\ntree! It was sacrilege, or at least--Fiddlestick! Miss Terry\'s mind was\r\ngrowing confused. She had a sudden impulse to rescue the toy from being\r\ntrampled into filthiness. The fire was better than that.\r\n\r\nShe hurried down the steps into the street, forgetting her shawl. She\r\nsought in the snow and snatched the pink morsel to safety. Straight to the\r\nfire she carried it, and once more held it to the flames. But again she\r\nfound it impossible to burn the thing. Once, twice, she tried. But each\r\ntime something seemed to clutch back her wrist. At last she shrugged\r\nimpatiently and laid the Angel on the mantelpiece beside the square old\r\nmarble clock, which marked the hour of half-past eight.\r\n\r\n"Well, I won\'t burn it to-night," she reflected. "Somehow, I can\'t do it\r\njust now. I don\'t see what has got into me! But to-morrow I will. Yes,\r\nto-morrow I will."\r\n\r\nShe sat down in the armchair and fumbled in the old play box for the\r\nremaining scraps. There were but a few meaningless bits of ribbon and\r\ngauze, with the end of a Christmas candle, the survivor of some past\r\nfestival, burned on some tree in the past. All these but the last she\r\ntossed into the fire, where they made a final protesting blaze. The\r\ncandle-end fell to the floor unnoticed.\r\n\r\n"There! That is the last of the stuff," she exclaimed with grim\r\nsatisfaction, shaking the dust from her black silk skirt. "It is all gone\r\nnow, thank Heaven, and I can go to bed in peace. No, I forgot Norah. I\r\nsuppose I must sit up and wait for her. Bother the girl! She ought to be in\r\nby now. What can she find to amuse her all this time? Christmas Eve!\r\nFiddlestick! But I have got rid of a lot of rubbish to-night, and that is\r\nworth something."\r\n\r\nShe sank back in her chair and clasped her hands over her breast with a\r\nsigh. She felt strangely weary. Her eyes sought the clock once more, and\r\ndoing so rested upon the Christmas Angel lying beside it. She frowned and\r\nclosed her eyes to shut out the sight with its haunting memories and\r\nsuggestions----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nBEFORE THE FIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a volume of sound outside, and a great brightness filled\r\nthe room. Miss Terry opened her eyes. The fire was burning red; but a\r\nyellow light, as from thousands of candles, shone in at the window, and\r\nthere was the sound of singing,--the sweetest singing that Miss Terry had\r\never heard.\r\n\r\n    "An Angel of the Lord came down,\r\n        And glory shone around."\r\n\r\nThe words seemed chanted by the voices of young angels. Miss Terry passed\r\nher hands over her eyes and glanced at the clock. But what the hour was she\r\nnever noticed, for her gaze was filled with something else. Beside the\r\nclock, in the spot where she had laid it a few minutes before, was the\r\nChristmas Angel. But now, instead of lying helplessly on its back, it was\r\nstanding on rosy feet, with arms outstretched toward her. Over its head\r\nfluttered gauzy wings. From under the yellow hair which rippled over the\r\nshoulders two blue eyes beamed kindly upon her, and the mouth widened into\r\nthe sweetest smile.\r\n\r\n"Peace on earth to men of good-will!" cried the Angel, and the tone of his\r\nspeech was music, yet quite natural and thrilling.\r\n\r\nMiss Terry stared hard at the Angel and rubbed her eyes, saying to herself,\r\n"Fiddlestick! I am dreaming!"\r\n\r\nBut she could not rub away the vision. When she opened her eyes the Angel\r\nstill stood tiptoe on the mantel-shelf, smiling at her and shaking his\r\ngolden head.\r\n\r\n"Angelina!" said the Angel softly; and Miss Terry trembled to hear her name\r\nthus spoken for the first time in years. "Angelina, you do not want to\r\nbelieve your own eyes, do you? But I am real; more real than the things you\r\nsee every day. You must believe in me. I am the Christmas Angel."\r\n\r\n"I know it." Miss Terry\'s voice was hoarse and unmanageable, as of one in a\r\nnightmare. "I remember."\r\n\r\n"You remember!" repeated the Angel. "Yes; you remember the day when you and\r\nTom hung me on the Christmas tree. You were a sweet little girl then, with\r\nblue eyes and yellow curls. You believed the Christmas story and loved\r\nSanta Claus. Then you were simple and affectionate and generous and\r\nhappy."\r\n\r\n"Fiddlestick!" Miss Terry tried to say. But the word would not come.\r\n\r\n"Now you have lost the old belief and the old love," went on the Angel.\r\n"Now you have studied books and read wise men\'s sayings. You understand the\r\nhigher criticism, and the higher charity, and the higher egoism. You don\'t\r\nbelieve in mere giving. You don\'t believe in the Christmas economics,--you\r\nknow better. But are you happy, dear Angelina?"\r\n\r\nAgain Miss Terry thrilled at the sound of her name so sweetly spoken; but\r\nshe answered nothing. The Angel replied for her.\r\n\r\n"No, you are not happy because you have cut yourself off from the things\r\nthat bring folk together in peace and good-will at this holy time. Where\r\nare your friends? Where is your brother to-night? You are still hard and\r\nunforgiving to Tom. You refused to see him to-day, though he wrote so\r\nboyishly, so humbly and affectionately. You have not tried to make any soul\r\nhappy. You don\'t believe in _me_, the Christmas Spirit."\r\n\r\nThere is such a word as Fiddlestick, whatever it may mean. But Miss Terry\'s\r\nmind and tongue were unable to form it.\r\n\r\n"The Christmas spirit!" continued the Angel. "What is life worth if one\r\ncannot believe in the Christmas spirit?"\r\n\r\nWith a powerful effort Miss Terry shook off her nightmare sufficiently to\r\nsay, "The Christmas spirit is no real thing. I have proved it to-night. It\r\nis not real. It is a humbug!"\r\n\r\n"Not real? A humbug?" repeated the Angel softly. "And you have proved it,\r\nAngelina, this very night?"\r\n\r\nMiss Terry nodded.\r\n\r\n"I know what you have done," said the Angel. "I know very well. How keen\r\nyou were! How clever! You made a test of Chance, to prove your point."\r\n\r\nAgain Miss Terry nodded with complacency.\r\n\r\n"What knowledge of the world! What grasp of human nature!" commented the\r\nAngel, smiling. "It is like you mere mortals to say, \'I will make my test\r\nin my own way. If certain things happen, I shall foresee what the result\r\nmust be. If certain other things happen, I shall know that I am right.\'\r\nEvents fall out as you expect, and you smile with satisfaction, feeling\r\nyour wisdom justified. It ought to make you happy. But does it?"\r\n\r\nMiss Terry regarded the Angel doubtfully.\r\n\r\n"Look now!" he went on, holding up a rosy finger. "You are so\r\nnear-sighted! You are so unimaginative! You do not dream beyond the thing\r\nyou see. You judge the tale finished while the best has yet to be told. And\r\nyou stake your faith, your hope, your charity upon this blind human\r\njudgment,--which is mere Chance!"\r\n\r\nMiss Terry opened her lips to say, "I saw--" but the Angel interrupted her.\r\n\r\n"You saw but the beginning," he said. "You saw but the first page of each\r\nhistory. Shall I turn over the leaves and let you read what really\r\nhappened? Shall I help you to see the whole truth instead of a part? On\r\nthis night holy Truth, which is of Heaven, comes for all men to see and to\r\nbelieve. Look!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nJACK AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Christmas Angel gently waved his hand to and fro. Gradually, as Miss\r\nTerry sat back in her chair, the library grew dark; or rather, things faded\r\ninto an indistinguishable blur. Then it seemed as if she were sitting at a\r\ntheatre gazing at a great stage. But at this theatre there was nothing\r\nabout her, nothing between her and the place where things were happening.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFirst she saw two little ragamuffins quarreling over something in the snow.\r\nShe recognized them. They were the two Jewish boys who had picked up the\r\nJack-in-the-box. An officer appeared, and they ran away, the bigger boy\r\nhaving possession of the toy; the smaller one with fists in his eyes,\r\nbawling with disappointment.\r\n\r\nMiss Terry\'s lips curled with the cynical disgust which she had felt when\r\nfirst witnessing this scene. But a sweet voice--and she knew it was the\r\nAngel\'s--whispered in her ear, "Wait and see!"\r\n\r\nShe watched the two boys run through the streets until they came to a dark\r\ncorner. There the little fellow caught up with the other, and once more the\r\nstruggle began. It was a hard and bloody fight. But this time the victory\r\nwas with the smaller lad, who used his fists and feet like an enraged\r\nanimal, until the other howled for mercy and handed over the disputed toy.\r\n\r\n"Whatcher want it fer, Sam?" he blubbered as he saw it go into the little\r\nfellow\'s pocket.\r\n\r\n"Mind yer own business! I just want it," answered Sam surlily.\r\n\r\n"Betcher I know," taunted the bigger boy.\r\n\r\n"Betcher yer don\'t."\r\n\r\n"Do!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t!"\r\n\r\nAnother fight seemed imminent. But wisdom prevailed with Sammy. He would\r\nnot challenge fate a third time. "Come on, then, and see," he grunted.\r\n\r\nAnd Ike followed. Off the two trudged, through the brilliantly lighted\r\nstreets, until they came to a part of the city where the ways were narrower\r\nand dark.\r\n\r\n"Huh! Knowed you was comin\' here," commented Ike as they turned into a\r\ngrim, dirty alley.\r\n\r\nLittle Sam growled, "Didn\'t!" apparently as a matter of habit.\r\n\r\n"Did!" reasserted Ike. "Just where I was comin\' myself."\r\n\r\nSam turned to him with a grin.\r\n\r\n"Was yer now? By--! Ain\'t that funny? I thought of it right off."\r\n\r\n"Sure. Same here!"\r\n\r\nThey both burst into a guffaw and executed an impromptu double-shuffle of\r\ndelight. They were at the door of a tenement house with steep stairs\r\nleading into darkness. Up three flights pounded the two pairs of heavy\r\nboots, till they reached a half-open door, whence issued the clatter of a\r\nsewing-machine and the voices of children. Sam stood on the threshold\r\ngrinning debonairly, with hands thrust into his pockets. Ike peered over\r\nhis shoulder, also grinning.\r\n\r\nIt was a meagre room into which they gazed, a room the chief furniture of\r\nwhich seemed to be babies. Two little ones sprawled on the floor. A third\r\ntiny tot lay in a broken-down carriage beside the door. A pale, ill-looking\r\nwoman was running the machine. On the cot bed was crumpled a fragile\r\nlittle fellow of about five, and a small pair of crutches lay across the\r\nfoot of the bed.\r\n\r\nWhen the two boys appeared in the doorway, the woman stopped her machine\r\nand the children set up a howl of pleasure. "Sammy! Ikey!" cried the woman,\r\nsmiling a wan welcome, as the babies crept and toddled toward the\r\nnewcomers. "Where ye come from?"\r\n\r\n"Been to see the shops and the lights in the swell houses," answered Sammy\r\nwith a grimace. "Gee! Ain\'t they wastin\' candles to beat the cars!"\r\n\r\n"Enough to last a family a whole year," muttered Ike with disgust.\r\n\r\nThe woman sighed. "Maybe they ain\'t wasted exactly," she said. "How I\'d\r\nlike to see \'em! But I got to finish this job. I told the chil\'ren they\r\nmustn\'t expect anything this Christmas. But they are too little to know the\r\ndifference anyway; all but Joe. I wish I had something for Joe."\r\n\r\n"I got something for Joe," said Sammy unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nThe face of the pale little cripple lighted.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" he asked eagerly. "Oh, what is it? A real Christmas present\r\nfor me?"\r\n\r\n"Naw! It ain\'t a Christmas present," said Sam.\r\n\r\n"We don\'t care anything about Christmas," volunteered Ikey with a grin.\r\n\r\nSam looked at him with a frown of rebuke.\r\n\r\n"It\'s just a _present_," he said. "And it didn\'t cost a cent. I didn\'t buy\r\nit. I--we found it!"\r\n\r\n"Found it in the street?" Joe\'s eyes shone.\r\n\r\n"Yah!" the boys nodded.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it _is_ a Christmas present!" cried Joe. "Santa Claus must have\r\ndropped it there for me, because he knew we hadn\'t any chimney in this\r\nhouse, and he sent you kind, kind boys to bring it to me."\r\n\r\nThe two urchins looked sideways at each other, but said nothing. Presently\r\nSam drew out the box from his pocket and tried to thrust it into Ike\'s\r\nhand. "You give it to \'um," he said. "You\'re the biggest."\r\n\r\n"Naw! You give it. You found it," protested Ike.\r\n\r\n"Ah, g\'wan!"\r\n\r\n"Big fool!"\r\n\r\nThere was a tussle, and it almost seemed as if the past unpleasantness was\r\nto be repeated from an opposite cause. But Joe\'s voice settled the dispute.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Sammy, please!" he cried. "I can\'t wait another minute. Do please give\r\nit to me now!"\r\n\r\nAt these words Sam stepped forward without further argument and laid the\r\nbox on the bed in front of the little cripple. The babies crowded about.\r\nThe mother left her machine and stood smiling faintly at the foot of the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nJoe pressed the spring. _Ping!_ Out sprang the Jack-in-the-box, with the\r\nsame red nose, the same leer, the same roguish eyes which had surprised the\r\nchildren of fifty years ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PING!_ OUT SPRANG THE JACK-IN-THE-BOX]\r\n\r\nJack was always sure of his audience. My! How they screamed and begged Joe\r\nto "do it again." And as for Joe, he lay back on his pillow and laughed and\r\nlaughed as though he would never stop. It was the first Jack any of them\r\nhad seen.\r\n\r\nTears stood in the mother\'s eyes. "Well," she said, "it\'s as good as a play\r\nto see him. Joe hasn\'t laughed like that for months. You boys have done him\r\nlots of good. I wouldn\'t wonder if it helped him get well! If you was\r\nChristians I\'d say you showed the real Christmas spirit. But Lord--perhaps\r\nye do, all the same! I dunno!"\r\n\r\nSam and Ike were so busy playing with the children that they did not hear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGradually the tenement house faded and became a blur before Miss Terry\'s\r\neyes. Once more she saw the mantel-shelf before her and the Christmas Angel\r\nwith outstretched arms waving to and fro. "You see!" he said. "You did not\r\nguess all the pleasure that was shut up in that box with old Jack, did\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\nMiss Terry shook her head.\r\n\r\n"And you see how different it all was from what you thought. Now let us see\r\nwhat became of the Canton-flannel dog."\r\n\r\n"The Flanton Dog." Miss Terry amended the phrase under her breath. It\r\nseemed so natural to use Tom\'s word.\r\n\r\n"Yes, the Flanton Dog," the Angel smiled. "What do you think became of\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\n"I saw what became of him," said Miss Terry. "Bob Cooper threw him under an\r\nautomobile, and he was crushed flatter than a pancake."\r\n\r\n"Then you left the window," said the Angel. "In your human way you assumed\r\nthat this was the end. But wait and see."\r\n\r\nOnce more the room darkened and blurred, and Miss Terry looked out upon\r\npast events as upon a busy, ever-shifting stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE DOG AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nShe saw the snowy street, into which, from the tip of his stick, Bob Cooper\r\nhad just tossed the Flanton Dog. She saw, what she had not seen before, the\r\nwoman and child on the opposite side of the street. She saw the baby\r\nstretch out wistful hands after the dog lying in the snow. Then an\r\nautomobile honked past, and she felt again the thrill of horror as it ran\r\nover the poor old toy. At the same moment the child screamed, and she saw\r\nit point tearfully at the Flanton tragedy. The mother, who had seen nothing\r\nof all this, stooped and spoke to him reprovingly.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter, Johnnie?" she said. "Sh! Don\'t make such a noise. Here\r\nwe are at Mrs. Wales\'s gate, and you mustn\'t make a fuss. Now be a good boy\r\nand wait here till Mother comes out."\r\n\r\nShe rang the area bell and stood basket in hand, waiting to be admitted.\r\nBut Johnnie gazed at one spot in the street, with eyes full of tears, and\r\nwith now and then a sob gurgling from his throat. He could not forget what\r\nhe had seen.\r\n\r\nThe door opened for the mother, who disappeared inside the house, with one\r\nlast command to the child: "Now be a good boy, Johnnie. I\'ll be back in\r\nhalf a minute."\r\n\r\nHardly was she out of sight when Johnnie started through the snowdrift\r\ntoward the middle of the street. With difficulty he lifted his little legs\r\nout of the deep snow; now and then he stumbled and fell into the soft mass.\r\nBut he rose only the more determined upon his errand, and kept his eyes\r\nfixed on the wreck of the Flanton Dog.\r\n\r\nBob Cooper, who was idly strolling up and down the block, smoking a\r\ncigarette, as he watched the flitting girlish shadows in a certain window\r\nopposite, saw the child\'s frantic struggles in the snow and was intensely\r\namused. "Bah Jove!" he chuckled. "I believe he\'s after the wretched dawg\r\nthat I tossed over there with my stick. Fahncy it!" And carelessly he\r\npuffed a whiff of smoke.\r\n\r\nAt last the baby reached the middle of the street and stooped to pick up\r\nthe battered toy. It was flattened and shapeless, but the child clasped it\r\ntenderly and began to coo softly to it.\r\n\r\n"Bah Jove!" repeated Cooper. "Fahncy caring so much about anything! Poor\r\nkid! Perhaps that is all the Christmas he will have." He blew a thoughtful\r\npuff through his nose. "Christmas Eve!" The thought flashed through his\r\nmind with a new appeal.\r\n\r\nJust then came a sudden "_Honk, honk!_" An automobile had turned the corner\r\nand was coming up at full speed. It was the same machine which had passed a\r\nfew minutes earlier in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n"Hi there!" Cooper yelled to the child. But the latter was sitting in the\r\nsnow in the middle of the street, rocking back and forth, with the Flanton\r\nDog in his arms. There was scarcely time for action. Bob dropped his\r\ncigarette and his cane, made one leap into the street and another to the\r\nchild, and by the impact of his body threw the baby into the drift at the\r\ncurb. With a horrified _honk_ the automobile passed over the young man, who\r\nlay senseless in the snow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOB COOPER SAVES THE BABY]\r\n\r\nHe was not killed. Miss Terry saw him taken to his home close by, where his\r\nbroken leg was set and his bruises attended to. She saw him lying bandaged\r\nand white on his bed when the woman and her child were brought to see him.\r\nJohnnie was still clasping closely the unlucky Flanton Dog.\r\n\r\n"Well, Kid," said the young man feebly, "so you saved the dog, after all."\r\n\r\n"O sir!" cried the poor woman, weeping. "Only to think that he would not\r\nbe here now but for you. What a Christmas that would have been for me! You\r\nwere so good, so brave!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, rot!" protested Bob faintly. "Had to do it; my fault anyway; Christmas\r\nEve,--couldn\'t see a kid hurt on Christmas Eve."\r\n\r\nHe called the attendant and asked for the pocket-book which had been in his\r\ncoat at the time of the accident. Putting it into the woman\'s hand, he\r\nsaid, "Good-by. Get Johnnie something really jolly for Christmas. I\'m\r\nafraid the dog is about all in. Get him a new one."\r\n\r\nBut Johnnie refused to have a new dog. It was the poor, shapeless Flanton\r\nanimal which remained the darling of his heart for many a moon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll this of past and future Miss Terry knew through the Angel\'s power. When\r\nonce more the library lightened, and she saw the pink figure smiling at her\r\nfrom the mantel, she spoke of her own accord.\r\n\r\n"It was my fault, because I put the dog in the way. I caused all that\r\ntrouble."\r\n\r\n"Trouble?" said the Angel, puzzled. "Do you call it _trouble?_ Do you not\r\nsee what it has done for that heartless youth? It brought his good moment.\r\nPerhaps he will be a different man after this. And as for the child; he was\r\nmade happy by something that would otherwise have been wasted, and he has\r\ngained a friend who will not forget him. Trouble! And do you think _you_\r\ndid it?" He laughed knowingly.\r\n\r\n"I certainly did," said Miss Terry firmly.\r\n\r\n"But it was I, yes _I_, the Christmas Spirit, who put it into your head to\r\ndo what you did. You may not believe it, but so it was. You too, even you,\r\nAngelina, could not quite escape the influence of the Christmas Spirit, and\r\nso these things have happened. But now let us see what became of the third\r\nexperiment."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nNOAH AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the street of candles a woman dressed all in black had picked up the\r\npoor old Noah\'s ark and was looking at it wildly. She was a widow who had\r\njust lost her only child, a little son, and she was in a state of morbid\r\nbitterness bordering on distraction.\r\n\r\nWhen the second woman with the two little ones came up and begged for the\r\ntoy, something hard and sullen and cruel rose in the widow\'s heart, and she\r\nrefused angrily to give up the thing. She hated those two boys who had been\r\nspared when her own was taken. She would not make them happy.\r\n\r\n"No, you shall not have it," she cried, clutching the Noah\'s ark fiercely.\r\n"I will destroy it."\r\n\r\nThe poor woman and the children followed her wistfully. The little boys\r\nwere crying. They were cold and hungry and disappointed. They had come so\r\nnear to something pleasant. They had almost been lucky; but the luck had\r\npassed over their heads to another.\r\n\r\nThe woman in mourning strode on rapidly, the thoughts within her no less\r\nblack than the garments which she wore. She hated the world; she hated the\r\npeople who lived in it. She hated Christmas time, when every one seemed\r\nmerry except herself. And yes, yes! Most of all she hated children. She\r\nclenched her teeth wickedly; her mind reeled.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, somewhere, a chorus of happy voices began to sing the words of an\r\nold carol:--\r\n\r\n    "Holy night! Peaceful night!\r\n    All is dark save the light,\r\n    Yonder where they sweet vigil keep,\r\n    O\'er the Babe who in silent sleep\r\n      Rests in heavenly peace."\r\n\r\nSoftly and sweetly the childish voices ascended from the street. The woman\r\nin black stopped short, breathing hard. She saw the band of choristers\r\nstanding in a group on the sidewalk and in the snow, their hats pulled down\r\nover their eyes, their collars turned up around their ears, their hands\r\ndeep in pockets. In their midst rose the tall wooden cross carried by a\r\nlittle fellow with yellow hair. They sang as simply and as heartily as a\r\nflock of birds out in the snow.\r\n\r\nThe woman gave a great sob. Her little lad had been a choir boy,--perhaps\r\nthese were his one-time comrades. The second verse of the carol rang out\r\nsweetly:--\r\n\r\n    "Holy night! Peaceful night!\r\n    Only for shepherds\' sight\r\n    Came blest visions of angel throngs,\r\n    With their loud Hallelujah songs,\r\n      Saying, Jesus is come!"\r\n\r\nSuddenly it seemed to the distracted mother that her own boy\'s voice\r\nblended with those others. He too was singing in honor of that Child. Happy\r\nand ever young, he was bidding her rejoice in the day which made all\r\nchildhood sacred. And for his sake she had been hating children!\r\n\r\nWith a sudden revulsion of feeling she turned to see what had become of the\r\npoor mother and her boys. They were not far behind, huddling in the shadow.\r\nThe black woman strode quickly up to them. They shrank pitifully at her\r\napproach, and she felt the shame of it. They were afraid of her!\r\n\r\n"Here," she said, thrusting the Noah\'s ark into the hands of the larger\r\nboy. "Take it. It belongs to you."\r\n\r\nThe child took it timidly. The mother began to protest thanks. Trying to\r\ncontrol the shake in her voice the dark lady spoke again. "Have you\r\nprepared a Christmas for your children?"\r\n\r\nThe woman shook her head. "I have nothing," she sighed. "A roof over our\r\nheads, that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"Your husband?"\r\n\r\n"My man died a month ago."\r\n\r\nSo other folk had raw sorrows, too. The mourner had forgotten that.\r\n\r\n"There is no one expecting you at home?" Again the woman shook her head\r\ndolefully. "Come with me," said the dark lady impulsively. "You shall be my\r\nguests to-night. And to-morrow I will make a Christmas for the children.\r\nThe house shall put off its shadow. I too will light candles. I have\r\ntoys,"--her voice broke,--"and clothing; many things, which are being\r\nwasted. That is not right! Something led you to me, or me to you;\r\nsomething,--perhaps it was an Angel,--whoever dropped that Noah\'s ark in\r\nthe street. An Angel might do that, I believe. Come with me."\r\n\r\nThe woman and her sons followed her, rejoicing greatly in the midst of\r\ntheir wonder.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were tears in the eyes through which Miss Terry saw once more the\r\nChristmas Angel. She wiped them hastily. But still the Angel seemed to\r\nshine with a fairer radiance.\r\n\r\n"You see!" was all he said. And Miss Terry bowed her head. She began to\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nMIRANDA AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce more, on the wings of vision, Miss Terry was out in the snowy street.\r\nShe was following the fleet steps of a little girl who carried a\r\nwhite-paper package under her arm. Miss Terry knew that she was learning\r\nthe fate of her old doll, Miranda, whom her own hands had thrust out into a\r\ncold world.\r\n\r\nPoor Miranda! After all these years to become the property of a thief! Mary\r\nwas the little thief\'s name. Hugging the tempting package close, Mary ran\r\nand ran until she was out of breath. Her one thought was to get as far as\r\npossible from the place where the bundle had lain. For she suspected that\r\nthe steps where she had found it led up to the doll\'s home. That was why in\r\nher own eyes also she was a little thief. But now she had run so far and\r\nhad turned so many corners that she could not find her way back if she\r\nwould. There was triumph in the thought. Mary chuckled to herself as she\r\nstopped running and began to walk leisurely in the neighborhood with which\r\nshe was more familiar.\r\n\r\nShe pinched the package gently. Yes, there could be no doubt about it. It\r\nwas a doll,--not a very large doll; but Mary reflected that she had never\r\nthought she should care for a large doll. Undoubtedly it was a very nice\r\none. Had she not found it in a swell part of the city, on the steps of a\r\nswell-looking house? Mary gloated over the doll as she fancied it; with\r\nreal hair, and eyes that opened and shut; with four little white teeth, and\r\nhands with dimples in the knuckles. She had seen such dolls in the windows\r\nof the big shops. But she had never hoped to have one for her very own.\r\n\r\n"Maybe it will have on a blue silk dress and white kid shoes, like that one\r\nI saw this morning!" she mused rapturously.\r\n\r\nShe pinched the spot where she fancied the doll\'s feet ought to be.\r\n\r\n"Yes, she\'s got shoes, sure enough! I bet they\'re white, too. They _feel_\r\nwhite. Oh, what fun I shall have with her,"--she hugged the doll\r\nfondly,--"if Uncle and Aunt don\'t take her away!"\r\n\r\nThe sudden thought made her stand still in horror. "They sold Mother\'s\r\nlittle clock for rum," she said bitterly. "They sold the ring with the red\r\nstone that Father gave me on my birthday when I was seven. They sold the\r\npresents that I got at Sunday School last year. Oh, wouldn\'t it be dreadful\r\nif they should sell my new doll! And I know they will want to if they see\r\nher." She squeezed the bundle closer with the prescient pang of parting.\r\n\r\n"Maybe they\'ll be out somewhere." With this faint hope she reached the\r\ntenement and crept up the dingy stairs. She peeped in at the door. Alas!\r\nHer uncle and aunt were in the kitchen, through which she had to pass. They\r\nhad company; some dirty-looking men and women, and there were a jug and\r\nglasses on the table before them. Mary\'s heart sank, but she nodded bravely\r\nto the company and tried to slip through the crowd to the other room. But\r\nher aunt was quick to see that she carried something under her coat.\r\n\r\n"What you got there? A Christmas present?" she sneered.\r\n\r\nMary flushed. "No," she said slowly, "just something I found."\r\n\r\n"Found? Hello, what is it? A package!"\r\n\r\nHer uncle advanced and snatched it from her.\r\n\r\n"Please," pleaded Mary, "please, I found it. It is mine. I think it is only\r\na doll."\r\n\r\n"A doll! Huh! Who needs a doll?" hiccoughed her uncle. "We want something\r\nmore to drink. We\'ll sell it--"\r\n\r\nA bellow of laughter resounded through the room. The paper being torn\r\nroughly away, poor Miranda stood revealed in all her faded beauty. The\r\npallid waxen face, straggling hair, and old-fashioned dress presented a\r\nsorry sight to the greedy eyes which had expected to find something\r\nexchangeable for drink. A sorry sight she was to Mary, who had hoped for\r\nsomething so much lovelier. A flush of disappointment came into her cheek,\r\nand tears to her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Here, take your old doll," said her uncle roughly, thrusting it into her\r\narms. "Take your old doll and get away with her. If that\'s the best you can\r\nfind you\'d better _steal_ something next time."\r\n\r\nSteal something! Had she not in fact stolen it? Mary knew very well that\r\nshe had, and she flushed pinker yet to think what a fool she had made of\r\nherself for nothing. She took the despised doll and retreated into the\r\nother room, followed by a chorus of jeers and comments. She banged the door\r\nbehind her and sat down with poor Miranda on her knees, crying as if her\r\nheart would break. She had so longed for a beautiful doll! It did seem too\r\ncruel that when she found one it should turn out to be so ugly. She seized\r\npoor Miranda and shook her fiercely.\r\n\r\n"You horrid old thing!" she said. "Ain\'t you ashamed to fool me so? Ain\'t\r\nyou ashamed to make me think you was a lovely doll with pretty clo\'es and\r\n_white kid shoes?_ Ain\'t you?"\r\n\r\nShe shook Miranda again until her eyeballs rattled in her head. The doll\r\nfell to the floor and lay there with closed eyes. Her face was pallid and\r\nghastly. Her bonnet had fallen off, and her hair stuck out wildly in every\r\ndirection. Her legs were doubled under her in the most helpless fashion.\r\nShe was the forlornest figure of a doll imaginable. Presently Mary drew her\r\nhands away from her eyes and looked down at Miranda. There was something in\r\nthe doll\'s attitude as she lay there which touched the little girl\'s heart.\r\nOnce she had seen a woman who had been injured in the street,--she would\r\nnever forget it. The poor creature\'s eyes had been closed, and her face,\r\nunder the fallen bonnet, was of this same pasty color. Mary shuddered.\r\nSuddenly she felt a warm rush of pity for the doll.\r\n\r\n"You poor old thing!" she exclaimed, looking at Miranda almost tenderly.\r\n"I\'m sorry I shook you. You look so tired and sad and homesick! I wonder if\r\nsomebody is worrying about you this minute. It was very wicked of me to\r\ntake you away--on Christmas Eve, too! I wish I had left you where I found\r\nyou. Maybe some little girl is crying now because you are lost."\r\n\r\nMary stooped and lifted the doll gently upon her knees. As she took Miranda\r\nup, the blue eyes opened and seemed to look full at her. Miranda\'s one\r\nbeauty was her eyes. Mary felt her heart grow warmer and warmer toward the\r\nquaint stranger.\r\n\r\n"You have lovely eyes," she murmured. "I think after all you are almost\r\npretty. Perhaps I should grow to like you awfully. You are not a bit like\r\nthe doll I hoped to have; but that is not your fault." A thought made her\r\nface brighten. "Why, if you had been a beautiful doll they would have taken\r\nyou away and sold you for rum." Her face expressed utter disgust. She\r\nhugged Miranda close with a sudden outburst of affection. "Oh, you dear old\r\nthing!" she cried. "I am so glad you are--just like this. I am so glad, for\r\nnow I can keep you always and always, and no one will want to take you away\r\nfrom me."\r\n\r\nShe rocked to and fro, holding the doll tightly to her heart. Mary was not\r\none to feel a half-passion about anything. "I will make you some new\r\ndresses," she said, fingering the old-fashioned silk with a puzzled air. "I\r\nwonder why your mother dressed you so queerly? She was not much of a sewer\r\nif she made this bonnet!" Scornfully she took off the primitive bonnet and\r\nsmoothed out the tangled hair. "I wonder what you have on underneath," she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nWith gentle fingers she began to undress Miranda. Off came the green silk\r\ndress with its tight "basque" and overskirt. Off came the ruffled petticoat\r\nand little chemise edged with fine lace. And Miranda stood in shapeless,\r\nkid-bodied ugliness, which stage of evolution the doll of her day had\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nBut there was something more. Around her neck she wore a ribbon; on the\r\nribbon was a cardboard medal; and on the medal a childish hand had\r\nscratched the legend,--\r\n\r\n_Miranda Terry._\r\nIf lost, please return her to her mother,\r\n_Angelina Terry_,\r\n87 Overlook Terrace.\r\n\r\nIt was such a card as Miss Terry herself had worn in the days when her\r\nmother had first let her and Tom go out on the street without a nurse.\r\n\r\nMary stared hard at the bit of cardboard. 87 Overlook Terrace! Yes, that\r\nwas where she had found the doll. She remembered now seeing the name on a\r\nstreet corner. _Miranda;_ what a pretty name for a doll! _Angelina Terry;_\r\nso that was the name of the little girl who had lost Miranda. Angelina\r\nmust be feeling very sorry now. Perhaps she was crying herself to sleep,\r\nfor it was growing late.\r\n\r\nHer two girl cousins came romping into the bedroom. They had been having a\r\nhilarious evening.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Mary!" they cried. "We heard about your great find!"--"Playing with\r\nyour old doll, are you? Goin\' to hang up her stockin\' and see if Santa\r\nClaus will fill it?"--"Huh! Santa Claus won\'t come to _this_ house, I\r\nguess!"\r\n\r\nMary had almost forgotten that it was Christmas Eve. There had been nothing\r\nin the house to remind her. Perhaps Angelina Terry had hung up a stocking\r\nfor Miranda at 87 Overlook Terrace. But there would be no Miranda to see it\r\nthe next morning.\r\n\r\nHer cousins teased her for some time, while they undressed, and Mary grew\r\nsulky. She sat in her corner and answered them shortly. But presently the\r\nroom was quiet, for the girls slept easily. Then Mary crept into her little\r\ncot with the doll in her arms. She loved Miranda so much that she would\r\nnever part with her, no indeed; not even though she now knew where Miranda\r\nbelonged. 87 Overlook Terrace! The figures danced before her eyes\r\nmaliciously. She wished she could forget them. And the thought of Angelina\r\nTerry kept coming to her. Poor Angelina!\r\n\r\n"She ain\'t \'poor Angelina,\'" argued Mary to herself. "She\'s _rich_\r\nAngelina. Doesn\'t she live in a big house in the swell part of the city? I\r\ns\'pose she has hundreds of dolls, much handsomer than Miranda, and lots of\r\nother toys. I guess she won\'t miss this one queer old doll. I guess she\'d\r\nlet me keep it if she knew I hadn\'t any of my own. I guess it ought to be\r\nmy doll. Anyway, I\'m going to keep her. I don\'t believe Angelina loves\r\nMiranda so much as I do."\r\n\r\nShe laid her cheek against the doll\'s cold waxen one and presently fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nBut she slept uneasily. In the middle of the night she awoke and lay for\r\nhours tossing and unhappy in the stuffy little room. The clock struck one,\r\ntwo, three. At last she gave a great sigh, and cuddling Miranda in her arms\r\nturned over, with peace in her heart.\r\n\r\n"I will play you are mine, my very own dollie, for just this one night,"\r\nshe whispered in Miranda\'s ear. "To-morrow will be Christmas Day, and I\r\nwill take you back to your little mother, Angelina Terry. I can\'t do a mean\r\nthing at Christmas time,--not even for you, dear Miranda."\r\n\r\nThereupon she fell into a peaceful sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE ANGEL AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n"Will she bring it back?" asked Miss Terry eagerly, when once more she\r\nfound herself under the gaze of the Christmas Angel. He nodded brightly.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow morning you will see," he said. "It will prove that all I have\r\nshown you is really true."\r\n\r\n"A pretty child," said Miss Terry musingly. "A very nice child indeed. I\r\nbelieve she looks very much as I used to be myself."\r\n\r\n"You see, she is not a thief, after all; not _yet_," said the Angel. "What\r\na pity that she must live in that sad home, with such terrible people! A\r\nsensitive child like her, craving sympathy and affection,--what chance has\r\nshe for happiness? What would you yourself have been in surroundings like\r\nhers?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, she is very like what I was. Of course I shall let her keep the\r\ndoll."\r\n\r\nMiss Terry hesitated. The Angel looked at her steadily and his glance\r\nseemed to read her half-formed thoughts.\r\n\r\n"Surely," he said. "It seems to belong to her, does it not? But is this\r\nall? I wonder if something more does not belong to her."\r\n\r\n"What more?" asked Miss Terry shortly.\r\n\r\n"A home!" cried the Angel.\r\n\r\nMiss Terry groped in her memory for a scornful ejaculation which she had\r\nonce been fond of using, but there was no such word to be found. Instead\r\nthere came to her lips the name, "Mary."\r\n\r\nThe Angel repeated it softly. "_Mary._ It is a blessed name," he said.\r\n"Blessed the roof that shelters a Mary in her need."\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence, in which Miss Terry felt new impulses stirring\r\nwithin her; impulses drawing her to the child whose looks recalled her own\r\nchildhood. The Angel regarded her with beaming eyes. After some time he\r\nsaid quietly, "Now let us see what became of your last experiment."\r\n\r\nMiss Terry started. It seemed as if she had been interrupted in pleasant\r\ndreaming. "_You_ were the last experiment," she said. "I know what became\r\nof you. Here you are!"\r\n\r\n"Yet more may have happened than you guessed," replied the Angel meaningly.\r\n"I have tried to show you how often that is the case. Look again."\r\n\r\nWithout moving from her chair Miss Terry seemed to be looking out on her\r\nsidewalk, where, so it seemed, she had just laid the pink figure of the\r\nAngel. She saw the drunken man approach. She heard his coarse laugh; saw\r\nhis brutal movement as he kicked the Christmas token into the street. In\r\nsick disgust she saw him reel away out of sight. She saw herself run down\r\nthe steps, rescue the image, and bring it into the house. Surely the story\r\nwas finished. What more could there be?\r\n\r\nBut something bade her vision follow the steps of the wretched man. Down\r\nthe street he reeled, singing a blasphemous song. With a whoop he rounded a\r\ncorner and ran into a happy party which filled sidewalk and street, as it\r\nhurried in the direction from which he came. Good-naturedly they jostled\r\nhim against the wall, and he grasped a railing to steady himself as they\r\nswept by. It was the choir on their way to carol in the next street. Before\r\nthem went the cross-bearer, lifting high his simple wooden emblem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HE GRASPED A RAILING TO STEADY HIMSELF]\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the drunken man caught sight of this, and wavered. The presence\r\nof the crowd conveyed no meaning to his dazed brains. But there was\r\nsomething in the familiar symbol which held his vision. He looked, and\r\ncrossed himself, remembering the traditions of his childhood. Some of\r\nthe boys were humming as they went the stirring strains of an ancient\r\nChristmas march known to all nations; a carol which began, some say, as a\r\nrousing drinking chorus.\r\n\r\nThe familiar strain touched some chord in the sodden brain. The man gave a\r\nfeeble whinny, trying to follow the melody. He pulled himself together and\r\nlurched forward in a sudden impulse to join the band of pilgrims. But by\r\nthe time he had taken three steps they had vanished, miraculously, as it\r\nseemed to him.\r\n\r\n"Begorra, they\'re gone!" he cried. "Who were they? Were they rale folks?\r\nWhat was it they was singin\'?"\r\n\r\nHe sank back helplessly on a flight of steps. "_Ve-ni-te a-do-re-mus!_" he\r\ncroaked in a quavering basso. And his tangled mind went through strange\r\nprocesses. Suddenly, there came to him in a flash of exaggerated memory the\r\nfigure of the Christmas Angel which not ten minutes earlier he had kicked\r\ninto the street. A pious horror fell upon him.\r\n\r\n"Mither o\' mercy!" he cried, again crossing himself. "What have I been an\'\r\ndone? It was a howly image; an\' what did I do to ut? Lemme go back an\' find\r\nut, an\' take ut up out av the street."\r\n\r\nGreatly sobered by his fear, he staggered down the block and around the\r\ncorner to the steps of Miss Terry\'s house.\r\n\r\n"This is the place," he mused. "I know ut; here\'s where the frindly\r\nlam\'post hild me in its arrums. I rimimber there was a dark house forninst\r\nme. Here\'s where ut lay on the sidewalk, all pink an\' pretty. An\' I kicked\r\nut into the street! Where is ut now? Where gone? Howly Mither! Here\'s the\r\nspot where ut fell, look now! The shape of uts little body and the wings of\r\nut in the snow. But \'tis gone intirely!" He rubbed his eyes and crossed\r\nhimself again. "\'Tis flown away," he muttered. "\'Tis gone back to Hiven to\r\ntell Mary Mither o\' the wicked thing I done this night. Oh, \'tis a miracle\r\nthat\'s happened! An\' oh! The wicked man I am, drunk and disorderly on the\r\nHowly Eve!"\r\n\r\n    "O come, all ye faithful,\r\n      Joyful and triumphant!"\r\n\r\nOnce more he heard the familiar strain taken up lustily by many voices.\r\n\r\n"Hear all the world singin\' on the way to Bethlehem!" he said, and the\r\nstupor seemed to leave his brain. He no longer staggered.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll run an\' join \'em, an\' I won\'t drink another drop this night." He\r\nlooked up at the starry sky. "Maybe the Angel hears me. Maybe he\'ll help\r\nme to keep straight to-morrow. It might be my Guardian Angel himsilf that I\r\ntreated so! Saints forgive me!"\r\n\r\nWith head bowed humbly, but no longer reeling, he moved away towards the\r\nsound of music.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"You were his Guardian Angel," said Miss Terry, when once more she saw the\r\nfigure on the mantel-shelf. And she spoke with reverent gentleness.\r\n\r\nThe Angel smiled brightly. "The Christmas Spirit is a guardian angel to\r\nmany," he said. "Never again despise me, Angelina. Never again make light\r\nof my influence."\r\n\r\n"Never again," murmured Miss Terry half unconsciously. "I wish it were not\r\ntoo late--"\r\n\r\n"It is never too late," said the Christmas Angel eagerly, as if he read her\r\nunspoken thought. "Oh, never too late, Angelina."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTMAS CANDLE\r\n\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a sound,--a dull reverberating sound. It seemed to Miss\r\nTerry to come from neither north, south, east, nor west, but from a\r\ndifferent world. Ah! She recognized it now. It was somebody knocking on the\r\nlibrary door.\r\n\r\nMiss Terry gave a long sigh and drew herself up in her chair. "It must be\r\nNorah just come back," she said to herself. "I had forgotten Norah\r\ncompletely. It must be shockingly late. Come in," she called, as she\r\nglanced at the clock.\r\n\r\nShe rubbed her eyes and looked again. A few minutes after nine! She had\r\nthought it must be midnight!\r\n\r\nNorah entered to find her mistress staring at the mantel where the clock\r\nstood. She saw lying beside the clock the pink Angel which had fallen from\r\nthe box as she brought it in,--the box now empty by the fire.\r\n\r\n"Law, Miss," she said, "have you burned them all up but him? I\'m glad you\r\nsaved him, he\'s so pretty."\r\n\r\n"Norah," said Miss Terry with an effort, "is that clock right?"\r\n\r\n"Yes\'m," said Norah. "I set it this morning. I came back as soon as I\r\ncould, Miss," she added apologetically.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t that," answered Miss Terry, drawing her hand across her forehead\r\ndazedly. "I did not mind your absence. But I thought it must be later."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, I wouldn\'t stay out any later when you was alone here, Miss," said\r\nNorah penitently. "I felt ashamed after I had gone. I ought not to have\r\nleft you so,--on Christmas Eve. But oh, Miss! The singing was so beautiful,\r\nand the houses looked so grand with the candles in the windows. It is like\r\na holy night indeed!"\r\n\r\nMiss Terry stooped and picked up something from the floor. It was the bit\r\nof candle-end which had escaped the holocaust.\r\n\r\n"Are the candles still lighted, Norah?" she asked, eyeing the bit of wax in\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\n"Yes\'m, some of them," answered the maid. "It is getting late, and a good\r\nmany have burned out. But some houses are still as bright as ever."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it is not too late, then," murmured Miss Terry, as if yielding a\r\ndisputed point. "Let us hurry, Norah."\r\n\r\nShe rose, and going to the mantel-shelf gently took up the figure of the\r\nAngel, while Norah looked on in amazement.\r\n\r\n"Norah," said Miss Terry, with an eagerness which made her voice tremble,\r\n"I want you to hang the Christmas Angel in the window there. I too have a\r\nfancy to burn a candle to-night. If it is not too late I\'d like to have a\r\nlittle share in the Christmas spirit."\r\n\r\nNorah\'s eyes lighted. "Oh, yes\'m," she said. "I\'ll hang it right away. And\r\nI\'ll find an empty spool to hold the candle."\r\n\r\nShe bustled briskly about, and presently in the window appeared a little\r\ndevice unlike any other in the block. Against the darkness within, the\r\nfigure of the Angel with arms outstretched towards the street shone in a\r\nsoft light from the flame of a single tiny candle such as blossom on\r\nChristmas trees.\r\n\r\nIt caught the attention of many home-goers, who said, smiling, "How simple!\r\nHow pretty! How quaint! It is a type of the Christmas spirit which is\r\nabroad to-night. You can feel it everywhere, blessing the city."\r\n\r\nFor some minutes before the candle was lighted, a man muffled in a heavy\r\novercoat had been standing in a doorway opposite Miss Terry\'s house. He was\r\ntall and grizzled and his face was sad. He stared up at the gloomy windows,\r\nthe only oblongs of blackness in the illuminated block, and he shivered,\r\nshrugging his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"The same as ever!" he said to himself. "I might have known she would never\r\nchange. Any one else, on Christmas Eve, after the letter I wrote her, would\r\nhave softened a little. But I might have known. She is hard as nails! Of\r\ncourse, it was my fault in the first place to leave her as I did. But when\r\nI acknowledged it, and when I wrote that letter on Christmas Eve, I thought\r\nAngelina might feel differently." He looked at his watch. "Nearly half-past\r\nnine," he muttered. "I may as well go home. She said she wanted to be let\r\nalone; that Christmas meant nothing to her. I don\'t dare to call,--on my\r\nonly sister! I suppose she is there all alone, and here I am all alone,\r\ntoo. What a pity! If I saw the least sign--"\r\n\r\nJust then there was the spark of a match against the darkness framed in by\r\nthe window opposite. A hand and arm shone in the flicker of light across\r\nthe upper sash. A tiny spark, tremulous at first, like a bird alighting on\r\na frail branch, paused, steadied, and became fixed. In the light of a\r\nsmall taper the man caught a glimpse of a pale, long face in a frame of\r\nsilver hair. It faded into the background. But above the candle he now saw,\r\nwith arms outstretched as it seemed toward himself, a pink little angel\r\nwith gauzy wings.\r\n\r\nThe man\'s heart gave a leap. Sudden memories thronged his brain, making him\r\nalmost dizzy. At last they formulated into one smothered cry. "The\r\nChristmas Angel! It is the very same pink Angel that Angelina and I used to\r\nhang on our Christmas tree!"\r\n\r\nIn three great leaps, like a schoolboy, he crossed the street and ran up\r\nthe steps of Number 87. The Christmas Angel seemed to smile with ineffable\r\nsweetness as he gave the bell a vigorous pull.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTOM\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Terry was leaning on the mantel-shelf looking into the fire, when the\r\nbell pealed furiously. She started and turned pale.\r\n\r\n"Lord \'a\' mercy!" ejaculated Norah, who was still admiring the effect of\r\nthe window-decoration. "What\'s that? Who can be calling here to-night,\r\nmaking such a noise?"\r\n\r\n"Go to the door, Norah," said Miss Terry with a strange note in her voice.\r\n"It may be some one to see me. It is not too late."\r\n\r\n"Yes\'m," said Norah, obedient but bewildered.\r\n\r\nPresently the library door opened and a figure strode in; a tall,\r\nbroad-shouldered man in a fur overcoat. For a moment he stood just inside\r\nthe door, hesitating. Miss Terry took two steps forward from the\r\nfire-place.\r\n\r\n"Tom!" she said faintly. "You came,--after all!"\r\n\r\n"After all, Angelina," he said. "Yes, because I saw _that_," he waved his\r\nhand toward the window. "That gave me courage to come in. It is our\r\nChristmas Angel. I remember all about it. Does it mean anything, Angelina?"\r\n\r\nMiss Terry held out a moment longer. Then she faltered forward. "O Tom!"\r\nshe sobbed, as she felt his brotherly, strong arms about her. "O Tom! And\r\nso he has brought you back to me, and me to you!"\r\n\r\n"He? Angelina girl, who?" He smoothed her silver hair with rough, kind\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n"Why, the Christmas Angel; our Guardian Angel, Tom. All these years I kept\r\nhim in the play box, and I was going to burn him up. But I couldn\'t do it,\r\nTom. How wonderful it is!"\r\n\r\nThey sat down before the fire and she began to tell him the whole story.\r\nBut she interrupted herself to send for Norah, who came to her, mystified\r\nand half scandalized by the greeting which she had seen those two oldsters\r\nexchange.\r\n\r\n"This is my brother Tom, Norah, who has come back," she said. "I believe it\r\nis not too late to make some preparation for Christmas Day. The stores will\r\nstill be open. Run out and order things for a grand occasion, Norah. And--O\r\nNorah!" a sudden remembrance came to her. "If you have time, will you\r\nplease get some toys and pretty things such as a little girl would like; a\r\nlittle girl of about ten, with my complexion,--I mean, with yellow hair and\r\nblue eyes. We may have a little guest to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Yes\'m," said Norah, moving like one in a dream.\r\n\r\n"A guest?" exclaimed Tom. And Miss Terry told him about Mary.\r\n\r\n"I love little girls," said Tom, "especially little girls with yellow hair\r\nand blue eyes, such as you used to have, Angelina."\r\n\r\n"You will like Mary, then," said Miss Terry, with a pretty pink flush of\r\npleasure in her cheeks.\r\n\r\n"I shall like her, _if_ she comes," amended Tom, who, man-like, received\r\nwith reservations the account of a vision vouchsafed not unto him.\r\n\r\n"She will come," said Miss Terry with her old positiveness, glancing\r\ntowards the window where the Christmas Angel hung.\r\n\r\nThen arose the sound of singing outside the house. The passing choristers\r\nhad spied the quaint window, now the only one in the street which remained\r\nlighted:--\r\n\r\n    "When Christ was born of Mary free,\r\n    In Bethlehem, in that fair citye,\r\n    Angels sang with mirth and glee,\r\n      _In Excelsis Gloria!_"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Mary came. The brother and sister were at breakfast,--the happiest\r\nwhich either of them had known for years,--when there came a timid pull at\r\nthe front-door bell. Miss Angelina laid down her knife and fork and looked\r\nacross the table at Tom.\r\n\r\n"She has come. Mary has come," she said. "Norah, if it is a little girl\r\nwith a package under her arm, bring her in here."\r\n\r\n"Yes\'m!" gasped Norah, who believed she was living in a dream where\r\neverything was topsy-turvy. When had a child entered Miss Terry\'s\r\ndining-room!\r\n\r\nNorah disappeared and presently returned ushering in a little girl of ten,\r\nwith blue eyes and yellow hair. Under her arm she carried a white-paper\r\npackage, very badly wrapped.\r\n\r\nMiss Terry exchanged with her brother a glance which said, "I told you so!"\r\n\r\nThe child seemed bashful and afraid to speak; no wonder!\r\n\r\nTom\'s kind heart yearned to her. "Good morning! Wish you a merry\r\nChristmas, Mary!" he said smiling.\r\n\r\nThe child gave a start. "Why, how did you know my name?" she cried.\r\n\r\nTom looked confused. How indeed did he know? But Miss Angelina, with a\r\nreadiness that surprised herself, came to his rescue.\r\n\r\n"We were talking of a little girl named Mary," she said. "And you look just\r\nlike her. What did you come for, dear?"\r\n\r\nThe little girl hung her head and turned crimson.\r\n\r\n"I--I came to see Angelina Terry," she whispered. "I--I\'ve got a doll that\r\nbelongs to her."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, then Miss Terry said, "Well, go on."\r\n\r\n"I--I found her on the steps of this house last night, and I ought to\r\nhave brought her right here then. But I didn\'t. I took her home. I hope\r\nAngelina was not very unhappy last night."\r\n\r\nMiss Terry smiled upon Tom, who gave a kind, low laugh.\r\n\r\n"No," said Miss Terry. "Angelina did not worry about her lost doll. She was\r\nthinking about something else,--the nicest Christmas present that ever\r\nanybody had. But you were a good girl to bring back the doll."\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not a good girl," said Mary, and her voice trembled. "I was a\r\nwicked girl. I meant to keep Miranda for myself, because I thought she\r\nwould be a lovely big doll. And when I found she was old and homely,\r\nsomehow I still wanted to keep her. But it was stealing, and I couldn\'t.\r\nPlease, will you give her to Angelina, and tell her I am so sorry?" She\r\ntook Miranda out of the wrapping and held her toward Miss Terry without\r\nlooking at the doll. It was as if she were afraid of being tempted once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARY RETURNS THE DOLL]\r\n\r\nMiss Terry did not take the doll.\r\n\r\n"I am Angelina," she said. "The doll was mine."\r\n\r\n"You! Angelina!" the child\'s face was full of bewilderment. Mechanically\r\nshe drew Miranda to her and clasped her close.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am Angelina, and that was my doll Miranda," said Miss Terry gently.\r\n"Thank you for returning her. But Mary,--your name is Mary?" The child\r\nnodded.--"Suppose I wanted you to keep her for me, what would you say?"\r\n\r\nMary\'s eyes still dwelt upon Miss Terry with a puzzled look. This\r\ngray-haired Angelina was so different from the one she had pictured. She\r\ndid not answer the question. Miss Terry drew the child to a chair beside\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Tell me all about yourself, Mary," she said.\r\n\r\nAfter some coaxing and prompting from what they already guessed, Mary told\r\nthe story of her sad little life.\r\n\r\nShe was an orphan recently left to the care of her uncle and aunt, who had\r\nreceived her grudgingly. They were her sole relatives; and the shame of\r\ntheir degraded lives was plain through the outlines of the vague picture\r\nwhich Mary sketched of them.\r\n\r\n"You do not love them, Mary?" asked Miss Terry kindly.\r\n\r\n"No," answered the child. "They always speak crossly to me. When they have\r\nbeen drinking they beat me."\r\n\r\nTom rose from the table with a muttered word and began to pace the floor.\r\nHis blue eyes were full of tears.\r\n\r\n"Mary," said Miss Terry, "will the people at home be worried if you do not\r\ncome back to dinner?"\r\n\r\nMary shook her head wonderingly. "No," she said. "They will not care. I am\r\noften away on holidays. I go to the Museums."\r\n\r\n"Then I want you to stay with us to-day," said Miss Terry. "We are going\r\nto have a Christmas celebration, and we need you for a guest. Will you\r\nstay, you and Miranda?"\r\n\r\nMary looked down at the doll in her arms, and up at the two kind faces bent\r\ntoward her. "Yes," she said impulsively, "I will stay. How good you are! I\r\ndon\'t want to go home."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t go home!" burst out Tom. "Stay with us always and be our little\r\ngirl."\r\n\r\nMary looked from one to the other, half frightened at the new idea. Miss\r\nTerry bent and pecked at her cheek, with a thrill at the new sensation.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we mean it," she said, and her voice was almost sweet. "We believe\r\nthat the Christmas Angel has brought you to us, Mary. You have the\r\nChristmas name. But you seem to us like the little girl we both knew best,\r\nlittle Angelina with blue eyes and yellow hair, who was Miranda\'s mother.\r\nWill you stay with us, Mary Angelina? Would you like to stay?"\r\n\r\nMary looked up with a wistful smile. "You are so good!" she said again. "I\r\nwish I could stay. But Uncle and Aunt are so--I am afraid of what they\r\nmight do to us all. If they thought you wanted me, they would not let me\r\ngo."\r\n\r\n"I will fix Uncle and Aunt," said Tom, going for his coat. "Leave them to\r\nme. I know an argument that settles uncles and aunts of that sort. You need\r\nnot go back to their house, I promise you, Mary, my dear."\r\n\r\nMary gave a great sigh of relief. "Oh, I am so glad!" she said. "It was\r\nsuch a wicked house. And here it is so good!"\r\n\r\n"Good!" Miss Terry echoed the word with a sigh. "Come with me, Mary," she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nShe led her little guest through the hall to the library, where a great\r\nfire was blazing, with sundry mysterious packages in white paper piled on\r\nthe table beside it. But Miss Terry did not stop at the fire-place. She\r\ndrew Mary to the window which looked out on the sidewalk. Above the lower\r\nsash Mary saw the remains of a burned-out Christmas candle; and over it\r\nhung a pink papier-mache Angel stretching out open arms towards her.\r\n\r\n"This is the Christmas Angel, Mary," said Miss Terry. "He is as old as\r\nMiranda--"\r\n\r\n"He is as old as Christmas," interrupted Tom, looking in from the hall.\r\n\r\n"When we were children, Tom and I, we hung him on our Christmas tree," went\r\non Miss Terry. "We think he brought you to us. We believe he has changed\r\nthe world for us,--has brought us peace, good-will, and happiness. He is\r\ngoing to be the guardian angel of our house. You must love him, Mary."\r\n\r\n"How beautiful he is!" said Mary reverently. "His face shines like the\r\nBaby\'s that I saw once in the Church. Oh, Miss Angelina! He is like the\r\nChrist-Child himself!"\r\n\r\n"Call me Aunt Angelina," said Miss Terry with a quick breath.\r\n\r\n"Aunt Angelina," cried the child, throwing her arms about Miss Terry\'s\r\nneck.\r\n\r\nTom came and put his great furry coat-sleeves about them both. "And Uncle\r\nTom," he said.\r\n\r\n"Dear Uncle Tom!" whispered the child shyly.\r\n\r\nThere were tears in the eyes of all three.\r\n\r\n"Now we shall live happy ever after," said Tom.\r\n\r\nAnd the Christmas Angel beamed upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Christmas Angel, by Abbie Farwell Brown\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CHRISTMAS ANGEL ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 15709.txt or 15709.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/1/5/7/0/15709/\r\n\r\nProduced by Suzanne Shell, Elaine Walker and the Online Distributed\r\nProofreading Team.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
