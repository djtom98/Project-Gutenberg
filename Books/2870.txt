This\r\nprofession in America has constantly been held in honour, and more\r\nsuccessfully than elsewhere has put forward a claim to the epithet of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cliberal.\xe2\x80\x9d  In a country in which, to play a social part, you must either\r\nearn your income or make believe that you earn it, the healing art has\r\nappeared in a high degree to combine two recognised sources of credit.\r\nIt belongs to the realm of the practical, which in the United States is a\r\ngreat recommendation; and it is touched by the light of science\xe2\x80\x94a merit\r\nappreciated in a community in which the love of knowledge has not always\r\nbeen accompanied by leisure and opportunity.  It was an element in Dr.\r\nSloper\xe2\x80\x99s reputation that his learning and his skill were very evenly\r\nbalanced; he was what you might call a scholarly doctor, and yet there\r\nwas nothing abstract in his remedies\xe2\x80\x94he always ordered you to take\r\nsomething.  Though he was felt to be extremely thorough, he was not\r\nuncomfortably theoretic, and if he sometimes explained matters rather\r\nmore minutely than might seem of use to the patient, he never went so far\r\n(like some practitioners one has heard of) as to trust to the explanation\r\nalone, but always left behind him an inscrutable prescription.  There\r\nwere some doctors that left the prescription without offering any\r\nexplanation at all; and he did not belong to that class either, which\r\nwas, after all, the most vulgar.  It will be seen that I am describing a\r\nclever man; and this is really the reason why Dr. Sloper had become a\r\nlocal celebrity.  At the time at which we are chiefly concerned with him,\r\nhe was some fifty years of age, and his popularity was at its height.  He\r\nwas very witty, and he passed in the best society of New York for a man\r\nof the world\xe2\x80\x94which, indeed, he was, in a very sufficient degree.  I\r\nhasten to add, to anticipate possible misconception, that he was not the\r\nleast of a charlatan.  He was a thoroughly honest man\xe2\x80\x94honest in a degree\r\nof which he had perhaps lacked the opportunity to give the complete\r\nmeasure; and, putting aside the great good-nature of the circle in which\r\nhe practised, which was rather fond of boasting that it possessed the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbrightest\xe2\x80\x9d doctor in the country, he daily justified his claim to the\r\ntalents attributed to him by the popular voice.  He was an observer, even\r\na philosopher, and to be bright was so natural to him, and (as the\r\npopular voice said) came so easily, that he never aimed at mere effect,\r\nand had none of the little tricks and pretensions of second-rate\r\nreputations.  It must be confessed that fortune had favoured him, and\r\nthat he had found the path to prosperity very soft to his tread.  He had\r\nmarried at the age of twenty-seven, for love, a very charming girl, Miss\r\nCatherine Harrington, of New York, who, in addition to her charms, had\r\nbrought him a solid dowry.  Mrs. Sloper was amiable, graceful,\r\naccomplished, elegant, and in 1820 she had been one of the pretty girls\r\nof the small but promising capital which clustered about the Battery and\r\noverlooked the Bay, and of which the uppermost boundary was indicated by\r\nthe grassy waysides of Canal Street.  Even at the age of twenty-seven\r\nAustin Sloper had made his mark sufficiently to mitigate the anomaly of\r\nhis having been chosen among a dozen suitors by a young woman of high\r\nfashion, who had ten thousand dollars of income and the most charming\r\neyes in the island of Manhattan.  These eyes, and some of their\r\naccompaniments, were for about five years a source of extreme\r\nsatisfaction to the young physician, who was both a devoted and a very\r\nhappy husband.  The fact of his having married a rich woman made no\r\ndifference in the line he had traced for himself, and he cultivated his\r\nprofession with as definite a purpose as if he still had no other\r\nresources than his fraction of the modest patrimony which on his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath he had shared with his brothers and sisters.  This purpose had not\r\nbeen preponderantly to make money\xe2\x80\x94it had been rather to learn something\r\nand to do something.  To learn something interesting, and to do something\r\nuseful\xe2\x80\x94this was, roughly speaking, the programme he had sketched, and of\r\nwhich the accident of his wife having an income appeared to him in no\r\ndegree to modify the validity.  He was fond of his practice, and of\r\nexercising a skill of which he was agreeably conscious, and it was so\r\npatent a truth that if he were not a doctor there was nothing else he\r\ncould be, that a doctor he persisted in being, in the best possible\r\nconditions.  Of course his easy domestic situation saved him a good deal\r\nof drudgery, and his wife\xe2\x80\x99s affiliation to the \xe2\x80\x9cbest people\xe2\x80\x9d brought him\r\na good many of those patients whose symptoms are, if not more interesting\r\nin themselves than those of the lower orders, at least more consistently\r\ndisplayed.  He desired experience, and in the course of twenty years he\r\ngot a great deal.  It must be added that it came to him in some forms\r\nwhich, whatever might have been their intrinsic value, made it the\r\nreverse of welcome.  His first child, a little boy of extraordinary\r\npromise, as the Doctor, who was not addicted to easy enthusiasms, firmly\r\nbelieved, died at three years of age, in spite of everything that the\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s tenderness and the father\xe2\x80\x99s science could invent to save him.\r\nTwo years later Mrs. Sloper gave birth to a second infant\xe2\x80\x94an infant of a\r\nsex which rendered the poor child, to the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s sense, an inadequate\r\nsubstitute for his lamented first-born, of whom he had promised himself\r\nto make an admirable man.  The little girl was a disappointment; but this\r\nwas not the worst.  A week after her birth the young mother, who, as the\r\nphrase is, had been doing well, suddenly betrayed alarming symptoms, and\r\nbefore another week had elapsed Austin Sloper was a widower.\r\n\r\nFor a man whose trade was to keep people alive, he had certainly done\r\npoorly in his own family; and a bright doctor who within three years\r\nloses his wife and his little boy should perhaps be prepared to see\r\neither his skill or his affection impugned.  Our friend, however, escaped\r\ncriticism: that is, he escaped all criticism but his own, which was much\r\nthe most competent and most formidable.  He walked under the weight of\r\nthis very private censure for the rest of his days, and bore for ever the\r\nscars of a castigation to which the strongest hand he knew had treated\r\nhim on the night that followed his wife\xe2\x80\x99s death.  The world, which, as I\r\nhave said, appreciated him, pitied him too much to be ironical; his\r\nmisfortune made him more interesting, and even helped him to be the\r\nfashion.  It was observed that even medical families cannot escape the\r\nmore insidious forms of disease, and that, after all, Dr. Sloper had lost\r\nother patients beside the two I have mentioned; which constituted an\r\nhonourable precedent.  His little girl remained to him, and though she\r\nwas not what he had desired, he proposed to himself to make the best of\r\nher.  He had on hand a stock of unexpended authority, by which the child,\r\nin its early years, profited largely.  She had been named, as a matter of\r\ncourse, after her poor mother, and even in her most diminutive babyhood\r\nthe Doctor never called her anything but Catherine.  She grew up a very\r\nrobust and healthy child, and her father, as he looked at her, often said\r\nto himself that, such as she was, he at least need have no fear of losing\r\nher.  I say \xe2\x80\x9csuch as she was,\xe2\x80\x9d because, to tell the truth\xe2\x80\x94But this is a\r\ntruth of which I will defer the telling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN the child was about ten years old, he invited his sister, Mrs.\r\nPenniman, to come and stay with him.  The Miss Slopers had been but two\r\nin number, and both of them had married early in life.  The younger, Mrs.\r\nAlmond by name, was the wife of a prosperous merchant, and the mother of\r\na blooming family.  She bloomed herself, indeed, and was a comely,\r\ncomfortable, reasonable woman, and a favourite with her clever brother,\r\nwho, in the matter of women, even when they were nearly related to him,\r\nwas a man of distinct preferences.  He preferred Mrs. Almond to his\r\nsister Lavinia, who had married a poor clergyman, of a sickly\r\nconstitution and a flowery style of eloquence, and then, at the age of\r\nthirty-three, had been left a widow, without children, without\r\nfortune\xe2\x80\x94with nothing but the memory of Mr. Penniman\xe2\x80\x99s flowers of speech,\r\na certain vague aroma of which hovered about her own conversation.\r\nNevertheless he had offered her a home under his own roof, which Lavinia\r\naccepted with the alacrity of a woman who had spent the ten years of her\r\nmarried life in the town of Poughkeepsie.  The Doctor had not proposed to\r\nMrs. Penniman to come and live with him indefinitely; he had suggested\r\nthat she should make an asylum of his house while she looked about for\r\nunfurnished lodgings.  It is uncertain whether Mrs. Penniman ever\r\ninstituted a search for unfurnished lodgings, but it is beyond dispute\r\nthat she never found them.  She settled herself with her brother and\r\nnever went away, and when Catherine was twenty years old her Aunt Lavinia\r\nwas still one of the most striking features of her immediate _entourage_.\r\nMrs. Penniman\xe2\x80\x99s own account of the matter was that she had remained to\r\ntake charge of her niece\xe2\x80\x99s education.  She had given this account, at\r\nleast, to every one but the Doctor, who never asked for explanations\r\nwhich he could entertain himself any day with inventing.  Mrs. Penniman,\r\nmoreover, though she had a good deal of a certain sort of artificial\r\nassurance, shrank, for indefinable reasons, from presenting herself to\r\nher brother as a fountain of instruction.  She had not a high sense of\r\nhumour, but she had enough to prevent her from making this mistake; and\r\nher brother, on his side, had enough to excuse her, in her situation, for\r\nlaying him under contribution during a considerable part of a lifetime.\r\nHe therefore assented tacitly to the proposition which Mrs. Penniman had\r\ntacitly laid down, that it was of importance that the poor motherless\r\ngirl should have a brilliant woman near her.  His assent could only be\r\ntacit, for he had never been dazzled by his sister\xe2\x80\x99s intellectual lustre.\r\nSave when he fell in love with Catherine Harrington, he had never been\r\ndazzled, indeed, by any feminine characteristics whatever; and though he\r\nwas to a certain extent what is called a ladies\xe2\x80\x99 doctor, his private\r\nopinion of the more complicated sex was not exalted.  He regarded its\r\ncomplications as more curious than edifying, and he had an idea of the\r\nbeauty of _reason_, which was, on the whole, meagrely gratified by what\r\nhe observed in his female patients.  His wife had been a reasonable\r\nwoman, but she was a bright exception; among several things that he was\r\nsure of, this was perhaps the principal.  Such a conviction, of course,\r\ndid little either to mitigate or to abbreviate his widowhood; and it set\r\na limit to his recognition, at the best, of Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s possibilities and\r\nof Mrs. Penniman\xe2\x80\x99s ministrations.  He, nevertheless, at the end of six\r\nmonths, accepted his sister\xe2\x80\x99s permanent presence as an accomplished fact,\r\nand as Catherine grew older perceived that there were in effect good\r\nreasons why she should have a companion of her own imperfect sex.  He was\r\nextremely polite to Lavinia, scrupulously, formally polite; and she had\r\nnever seen him in anger but once in her life, when he lost his temper in\r\na theological discussion with her late husband.  With her he never\r\ndiscussed theology, nor, indeed, discussed anything; he contented himself\r\nwith making known, very distinctly, in the form of a lucid ultimatum, his\r\nwishes with regard to Catherine.\r\n\r\nOnce, when the girl was about twelve years old, he had said to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry and make a clever woman of her, Lavinia; I should like her to be a\r\nclever woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman, at this, looked thoughtful a moment.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Austin,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe then inquired, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think it is better to be clever than to be\r\ngood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood for what?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Doctor.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou are good for nothing unless you\r\nare clever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom this assertion Mrs. Penniman saw no reason to dissent; she possibly\r\nreflected that her own great use in the world was owing to her aptitude\r\nfor many things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I wish Catherine to be good,\xe2\x80\x9d the Doctor said next day; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nshe won\xe2\x80\x99t be any the less virtuous for not being a fool.  I am not afraid\r\nof her being wicked; she will never have the salt of malice in her\r\ncharacter.  She is as good as good bread, as the French say; but six\r\nyears hence I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have to compare her to good bread and\r\nbutter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you afraid she will turn insipid?  My dear brother, it is I who\r\nsupply the butter; so you needn\xe2\x80\x99t fear!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman, who had\r\ntaken in hand the child\xe2\x80\x99s accomplishments, overlooking her at the piano,\r\nwhere Catherine displayed a certain talent, and going with her to the\r\ndancing-class, where it must be confessed that she made but a modest\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman was a tall, thin, fair, rather faded woman, with a\r\nperfectly amiable disposition, a high standard of gentility, a taste for\r\nlight literature, and a certain foolish indirectness and obliquity of\r\ncharacter.  She was romantic, she was sentimental, she had a passion for\r\nlittle secrets and mysteries\xe2\x80\x94a very innocent passion, for her secrets had\r\nhitherto always been as unpractical as addled eggs.  She was not\r\nabsolutely veracious; but this defect was of no great consequence, for\r\nshe had never had anything to conceal.  She would have liked to have a\r\nlover, and to correspond with him under an assumed name in letters left\r\nat a shop; I am bound to say that her imagination never carried the\r\nintimacy farther than this.  Mrs. Penniman had never had a lover, but her\r\nbrother, who was very shrewd, understood her turn of mind.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen\r\nCatherine is about seventeen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cLavinia will try and\r\npersuade her that some young man with a moustache is in love with her.\r\nIt will be quite untrue; no young man, with a moustache or without, will\r\never be in love with Catherine.  But Lavinia will take it up, and talk to\r\nher about it; perhaps, even, if her taste for clandestine operations\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t prevail with her, she will talk to me about it.  Catherine won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee it, and won\xe2\x80\x99t believe it, fortunately for her peace of mind; poor\r\nCatherine isn\xe2\x80\x99t romantic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was a healthy well-grown child, without a trace of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeauty.  She was not ugly; she had simply a plain, dull, gentle\r\ncountenance.  The most that had ever been said for her was that she had a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnice\xe2\x80\x9d face, and, though she was an heiress, no one had ever thought of\r\nregarding her as a belle.  Her father\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of her moral purity was\r\nabundantly justified; she was excellently, imperturbably good;\r\naffectionate, docile, obedient, and much addicted to speaking the truth.\r\nIn her younger years she was a good deal of a romp, and, though it is an\r\nawkward confession to make about one\xe2\x80\x99s heroine, I must add that she was\r\nsomething of a glutton.  She never, that I know of, stole raisins out of\r\nthe pantry; but she devoted her pocket-money to the purchase of\r\ncream-cakes.  As regards this, however, a critical attitude would be\r\ninconsistent with a candid reference to the early annals of any\r\nbiographer.  Catherine was decidedly not clever; she was not quick with\r\nher book, nor, indeed, with anything else.  She was not abnormally\r\ndeficient, and she mustered learning enough to acquit herself respectably\r\nin conversation with her contemporaries, among whom it must be avowed,\r\nhowever, that she occupied a secondary place.  It is well known that in\r\nNew York it is possible for a young girl to occupy a primary one.\r\nCatherine, who was extremely modest, had no desire to shine, and on most\r\nsocial occasions, as they are called, you would have found her lurking in\r\nthe background.  She was extremely fond of her father, and very much\r\nafraid of him; she thought him the cleverest and handsomest and most\r\ncelebrated of men.  The poor girl found her account so completely in the\r\nexercise of her affections that the little tremor of fear that mixed\r\nitself with her filial passion gave the thing an extra relish rather than\r\nblunted its edge.  Her deepest desire was to please him, and her\r\nconception of happiness was to know that she had succeeded in pleasing\r\nhim.  She had never succeeded beyond a certain point.  Though, on the\r\nwhole, he was very kind to her, she was perfectly aware of this, and to\r\ngo beyond the point in question seemed to her really something to live\r\nfor.  What she could not know, of course, was that she disappointed him,\r\nthough on three or four occasions the Doctor had been almost frank about\r\nit.  She grew up peacefully and prosperously, but at the age of eighteen\r\nMrs. Penniman had not made a clever woman of her.  Dr. Sloper would have\r\nliked to be proud of his daughter; but there was nothing to be proud of\r\nin poor Catherine.  There was nothing, of course, to be ashamed of; but\r\nthis was not enough for the Doctor, who was a proud man and would have\r\nenjoyed being able to think of his daughter as an unusual girl.  There\r\nwould have been a fitness in her being pretty and graceful, intelligent\r\nand distinguished; for her mother had been the most charming woman of her\r\nlittle day, and as regards her father, of course he knew his own value.\r\nHe had moments of irritation at having produced a commonplace child, and\r\nhe even went so far at times as to take a certain satisfaction in the\r\nthought that his wife had not lived to find her out.  He was naturally\r\nslow in making this discovery himself, and it was not till Catherine had\r\nbecome a young lady grown that he regarded the matter as settled.  He\r\ngave her the benefit of a great many doubts; he was in no haste to\r\nconclude.  Mrs. Penniman frequently assured him that his daughter had a\r\ndelightful nature; but he knew how to interpret this assurance.  It\r\nmeant, to his sense, that Catherine was not wise enough to discover that\r\nher aunt was a goose\xe2\x80\x94a limitation of mind that could not fail to be\r\nagreeable to Mrs. Penniman.  Both she and her brother, however,\r\nexaggerated the young girl\xe2\x80\x99s limitations; for Catherine, though she was\r\nvery fond of her aunt, and conscious of the gratitude she owed her,\r\nregarded her without a particle of that gentle dread which gave its stamp\r\nto her admiration of her father.  To her mind there was nothing of the\r\ninfinite about Mrs. Penniman; Catherine saw her all at once, as it were,\r\nand was not dazzled by the apparition; whereas her father\xe2\x80\x99s great\r\nfaculties seemed, as they stretched away, to lose themselves in a sort of\r\nluminous vagueness, which indicated, not that they stopped, but that\r\nCatherine\xe2\x80\x99s own mind ceased to follow them.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that Dr. Sloper visited his disappointment upon\r\nthe poor girl, or ever let her suspect that she had played him a trick.\r\nOn the contrary, for fear of being unjust to her, he did his duty with\r\nexemplary zeal, and recognised that she was a faithful and affectionate\r\nchild.  Besides, he was a philosopher; he smoked a good many cigars over\r\nhis disappointment, and in the fulness of time he got used to it.  He\r\nsatisfied himself that he had expected nothing, though, indeed, with a\r\ncertain oddity of reasoning.  \xe2\x80\x9cI expect nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cso\r\nthat if she gives me a surprise, it will be all clear again.  If she\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t, it will be no loss.\xe2\x80\x9d  This was about the time Catherine had\r\nreached her eighteenth year, so that it will be seen her father had not\r\nbeen precipitate.  At this time she seemed not only incapable of giving\r\nsurprises; it was almost a question whether she could have received\r\none\xe2\x80\x94she was so quiet and irresponsive.  People who expressed themselves\r\nroughly called her stolid.  But she was irresponsive because she was shy,\r\nuncomfortably, painfully shy.  This was not always understood, and she\r\nsometimes produced an impression of insensibility.  In reality she was\r\nthe softest creature in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAS a child she had promised to be tall, but when she was sixteen she\r\nceased to grow, and her stature, like most other points in her\r\ncomposition, was not unusual.  She was strong, however, and properly\r\nmade, and, fortunately, her health was excellent.  It has been noted that\r\nthe Doctor was a philosopher, but I would not have answered for his\r\nphilosophy if the poor girl had proved a sickly and suffering person.\r\nHer appearance of health constituted her principal claim to beauty, and\r\nher clear, fresh complexion, in which white and red were very equally\r\ndistributed, was, indeed, an excellent thing to see.  Her eye was small\r\nand quiet, her features were rather thick, her tresses brown and smooth.\r\nA dull, plain girl she was called by rigorous critics\xe2\x80\x94a quiet, ladylike\r\ngirl by those of the more imaginative sort; but by neither class was she\r\nvery elaborately discussed.  When it had been duly impressed upon her\r\nthat she was a young lady\xe2\x80\x94it was a good while before she could believe\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94she suddenly developed a lively taste for dress: a lively taste is\r\nquite the expression to use.  I feel as if I ought to write it very\r\nsmall, her judgement in this matter was by no means infallible; it was\r\nliable to confusions and embarrassments.  Her great indulgence of it was\r\nreally the desire of a rather inarticulate nature to manifest itself; she\r\nsought to be eloquent in her garments, and to make up for her diffidence\r\nof speech by a fine frankness of costume.  But if she expressed herself\r\nin her clothes it is certain that people were not to blame for not\r\nthinking her a witty person.  It must be added that though she had the\r\nexpectation of a fortune\xe2\x80\x94Dr. Sloper for a long time had been making\r\ntwenty thousand dollars a year by his profession, and laying aside the\r\nhalf of it\xe2\x80\x94the amount of money at her disposal was not greater than the\r\nallowance made to many poorer girls.  In those days in New York there\r\nwere still a few altar-fires flickering in the temple of Republican\r\nsimplicity, and Dr. Sloper would have been glad to see his daughter\r\npresent herself, with a classic grace, as a priestess of this mild faith.\r\nIt made him fairly grimace, in private, to think that a child of his\r\nshould be both ugly and overdressed.  For himself, he was fond of the\r\ngood things of life, and he made a considerable use of them; but he had a\r\ndread of vulgarity, and even a theory that it was increasing in the\r\nsociety that surrounded him.  Moreover, the standard of luxury in the\r\nUnited States thirty years ago was carried by no means so high as at\r\npresent, and Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s clever father took the old-fashioned view of the\r\neducation of young persons.  He had no particular theory on the subject;\r\nit had scarcely as yet become a necessity of self-defence to have a\r\ncollection of theories.  It simply appeared to him proper and reasonable\r\nthat a well-bred young woman should not carry half her fortune on her\r\nback.  Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s back was a broad one, and would have carried a good\r\ndeal; but to the weight of the paternal displeasure she never ventured to\r\nexpose it, and our heroine was twenty years old before she treated\r\nherself, for evening wear, to a red satin gown trimmed with gold fringe;\r\nthough this was an article which, for many years, she had coveted in\r\nsecret.  It made her look, when she sported it, like a woman of thirty;\r\nbut oddly enough, in spite of her taste for fine clothes, she had not a\r\ngrain of coquetry, and her anxiety when she put them on was as to whether\r\nthey, and not she, would look well.  It is a point on which history has\r\nnot been explicit, but the assumption is warrantable; it was in the royal\r\nraiment just mentioned that she presented herself at a little\r\nentertainment given by her aunt, Mrs. Almond.  The girl was at this time\r\nin her twenty-first year, and Mrs. Almond\xe2\x80\x99s party was the beginning of\r\nsomething very important.\r\n\r\nSome three or four years before this Dr. Sloper had moved his household\r\ngods up town, as they say in New York.  He had been living ever since his\r\nmarriage in an edifice of red brick, with granite copings and an enormous\r\nfanlight over the door, standing in a street within five minutes\xe2\x80\x99 walk of\r\nthe City Hall, which saw its best days (from the social point of view)\r\nabout 1820.  After this, the tide of fashion began to set steadily\r\nnorthward, as, indeed, in New York, thanks to the narrow channel in which\r\nit flows, it is obliged to do, and the great hum of traffic rolled\r\nfarther to the right and left of Broadway.  By the time the Doctor\r\nchanged his residence the murmur of trade had become a mighty uproar,\r\nwhich was music in the ears of all good citizens interested in the\r\ncommercial development, as they delighted to call it, of their fortunate\r\nisle.  Dr. Sloper\xe2\x80\x99s interest in this phenomenon was only indirect\xe2\x80\x94though,\r\nseeing that, as the years went on, half his patients came to be\r\noverworked men of business, it might have been more immediate\xe2\x80\x94and when\r\nmost of his neighbours\xe2\x80\x99 dwellings (also ornamented with granite copings\r\nand large fanlights) had been converted into offices, warehouses, and\r\nshipping agencies, and otherwise applied to the base uses of commerce, he\r\ndetermined to look out for a quieter home.  The ideal of quiet and of\r\ngenteel retirement, in 1835, was found in Washington Square, where the\r\nDoctor built himself a handsome, modern, wide-fronted house, with a big\r\nbalcony before the drawing-room windows, and a flight of marble steps\r\nascending to a portal which was also faced with white marble.  This\r\nstructure, and many of its neighbours, which it exactly resembled, were\r\nsupposed, forty years ago, to embody the last results of architectural\r\nscience, and they remain to this day very solid and honourable dwellings.\r\nIn front of them was the Square, containing a considerable quantity of\r\ninexpensive vegetation, enclosed by a wooden paling, which increased its\r\nrural and accessible appearance; and round the corner was the more august\r\nprecinct of the Fifth Avenue, taking its origin at this point with a\r\nspacious and confident air which already marked it for high destinies.  I\r\nknow not whether it is owing to the tenderness of early associations, but\r\nthis portion of New York appears to many persons the most delectable.  It\r\nhas a kind of established repose which is not of frequent occurrence in\r\nother quarters of the long, shrill city; it has a riper, richer, more\r\nhonourable look than any of the upper ramifications of the great\r\nlongitudinal thoroughfare\xe2\x80\x94the look of having had something of a social\r\nhistory.  It was here, as you might have been informed on good authority,\r\nthat you had come into a world which appeared to offer a variety of\r\nsources of interest; it was here that your grandmother lived, in\r\nvenerable solitude, and dispensed a hospitality which commended itself\r\nalike to the infant imagination and the infant palate; it was here that\r\nyou took your first walks abroad, following the nursery-maid with unequal\r\nstep and sniffing up the strange odour of the ailantus-trees which at\r\nthat time formed the principal umbrage of the Square, and diffused an\r\naroma that you were not yet critical enough to dislike as it deserved; it\r\nwas here, finally, that your first school, kept by a broad-bosomed,\r\nbroad-based old lady with a ferule, who was always having tea in a blue\r\ncup, with a saucer that didn\xe2\x80\x99t match, enlarged the circle both of your\r\nobservations and your sensations.  It was here, at any rate, that my\r\nheroine spent many years of her life; which is my excuse for this\r\ntopographical parenthesis.\r\n\r\nMrs. Almond lived much farther up town, in an embryonic street with a\r\nhigh number\xe2\x80\x94a region where the extension of the city began to assume a\r\ntheoretic air, where poplars grew beside the pavement (when there was\r\none), and mingled their shade with the steep roofs of desultory Dutch\r\nhouses, and where pigs and chickens disported themselves in the gutter.\r\nThese elements of rural picturesqueness have now wholly departed from New\r\nYork street scenery; but they were to be found within the memory of\r\nmiddle-aged persons, in quarters which now would blush to be reminded of\r\nthem.  Catherine had a great many cousins, and with her Aunt Almond\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchildren, who ended by being nine in number, she lived on terms of\r\nconsiderable intimacy.  When she was younger they had been rather afraid\r\nof her; she was believed, as the phrase is, to be highly educated, and a\r\nperson who lived in the intimacy of their Aunt Penniman had something of\r\nreflected grandeur.  Mrs. Penniman, among the little Almonds, was an\r\nobject of more admiration than sympathy.  Her manners were strange and\r\nformidable, and her mourning robes\xe2\x80\x94she dressed in black for twenty years\r\nafter her husband\xe2\x80\x99s death, and then suddenly appeared one morning with\r\npink roses in her cap\xe2\x80\x94were complicated in odd, unexpected places with\r\nbuckles, bugles, and pins, which discouraged familiarity.  She took\r\nchildren too hard, both for good and for evil, and had an oppressive air\r\nof expecting subtle things of them, so that going to see her was a good\r\ndeal like being taken to church and made to sit in a front pew.  It was\r\ndiscovered after a while, however, that Aunt Penniman was but an accident\r\nin Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s existence, and not a part of its essence, and that when\r\nthe girl came to spend a Saturday with her cousins, she was available for\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfollow-my-master,\xe2\x80\x9d and even for leapfrog.  On this basis an\r\nunderstanding was easily arrived at, and for several years Catherine\r\nfraternised with her young kinsmen.  I say young kinsmen, because seven\r\nof the little Almonds were boys, and Catherine had a preference for those\r\ngames which are most conveniently played in trousers.  By degrees,\r\nhowever, the little Almonds\xe2\x80\x99 trousers began to lengthen, and the wearers\r\nto disperse and settle themselves in life.  The elder children were older\r\nthan Catherine, and the boys were sent to college or placed in\r\ncounting-rooms.  Of the girls, one married very punctually, and the other\r\nas punctually became engaged.  It was to celebrate this latter event that\r\nMrs. Almond gave the little party I have mentioned.  Her daughter was to\r\nmarry a stout young stockbroker, a boy of twenty; it was thought a very\r\ngood thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. PENNIMAN, with more buckles and bangles than ever, came, of course,\r\nto the entertainment, accompanied by her niece; the Doctor, too, had\r\npromised to look in later in the evening.  There was to be a good deal of\r\ndancing, and before it had gone very far, Marian Almond came up to\r\nCatherine, in company with a tall young man.  She introduced the young\r\nman as a person who had a great desire to make our heroine\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nacquaintance, and as a cousin of Arthur Townsend, her own intended.\r\n\r\nMarian Almond was a pretty little person of seventeen, with a very small\r\nfigure and a very big sash, to the elegance of whose manners matrimony\r\nhad nothing to add.  She already had all the airs of a hostess, receiving\r\nthe company, shaking her fan, saying that with so many people to attend\r\nto she should have no time to dance.  She made a long speech about Mr.\r\nTownsend\xe2\x80\x99s cousin, to whom she administered a tap with her fan before\r\nturning away to other cares.  Catherine had not understood all that she\r\nsaid; her attention was given to enjoying Marian\xe2\x80\x99s ease of manner and\r\nflow of ideas, and to looking at the young man, who was remarkably\r\nhandsome.  She had succeeded, however, as she often failed to do when\r\npeople were presented to her, in catching his name, which appeared to be\r\nthe same as that of Marian\xe2\x80\x99s little stockbroker.  Catherine was always\r\nagitated by an introduction; it seemed a difficult moment, and she\r\nwondered that some people\xe2\x80\x94her new acquaintance at this moment, for\r\ninstance\xe2\x80\x94should mind it so little.  She wondered what she ought to say,\r\nand what would be the consequences of her saying nothing.  The\r\nconsequences at present were very agreeable.  Mr. Townsend, leaving her\r\nno time for embarrassment, began to talk with an easy smile, as if he had\r\nknown her for a year.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a delightful party!  What a charming house!  What an interesting\r\nfamily!  What a pretty girl your cousin is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese observations, in themselves of no great profundity, Mr. Townsend\r\nseemed to offer for what they were worth, and as a contribution to an\r\nacquaintance.  He looked straight into Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.  She answered\r\nnothing; she only listened, and looked at him; and he, as if he expected\r\nno particular reply, went on to say many other things in the same\r\ncomfortable and natural manner.  Catherine, though she felt tongue-tied,\r\nwas conscious of no embarrassment; it seemed proper that he should talk,\r\nand that she should simply look at him.  What made it natural was that he\r\nwas so handsome, or rather, as she phrased it to herself, so beautiful.\r\nThe music had been silent for a while, but it suddenly began again; and\r\nthen he asked her, with a deeper, intenser smile, if she would do him the\r\nhonour of dancing with him.  Even to this inquiry she gave no audible\r\nassent; she simply let him put his arm round her waist\xe2\x80\x94as she did so it\r\noccurred to her more vividly than it had ever done before, that this was\r\na singular place for a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s arm to be\xe2\x80\x94and in a moment he was\r\nguiding her round the room in the harmonious rotation of the polka.  When\r\nthey paused she felt that she was red; and then, for some moments, she\r\nstopped looking at him.  She fanned herself, and looked at the flowers\r\nthat were painted on her fan.  He asked her if she would begin again, and\r\nshe hesitated to answer, still looking at the flowers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes it make you dizzy?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, in a tone of great kindness.\r\n\r\nThen Catherine looked up at him; he was certainly beautiful, and not at\r\nall red.  \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; she hardly knew why, for dancing had never\r\nmade her dizzy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, in that case,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Townsend, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will sit still and talk.\r\nI will find a good place to sit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe found a good place\xe2\x80\x94a charming place; a little sofa that seemed meant\r\nonly for two persons.  The rooms by this time were very full; the dancers\r\nincreased in number, and people stood close in front of them, turning\r\ntheir backs, so that Catherine and her companion seemed secluded and\r\nunobserved.  \xe2\x80\x9c_We_ will talk,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man had said; but he still did\r\nall the talking.  Catherine leaned back in her place, with her eyes fixed\r\nupon him, smiling and thinking him very clever.  He had features like\r\nyoung men in pictures; Catherine had never seen such features\xe2\x80\x94so\r\ndelicate, so chiselled and finished\xe2\x80\x94among the young New Yorkers whom she\r\npassed in the streets and met at parties.  He was tall and slim, but he\r\nlooked extremely strong.  Catherine thought he looked like a statue.  But\r\na statue would not talk like that, and, above all, would not have eyes of\r\nso rare a colour.  He had never been at Mrs. Almond\xe2\x80\x99s before; he felt\r\nvery much like a stranger; and it was very kind of Catherine to take pity\r\non him.  He was Arthur Townsend\xe2\x80\x99s cousin\xe2\x80\x94not very near; several times\r\nremoved\xe2\x80\x94and Arthur had brought him to present him to the family.  In\r\nfact, he was a great stranger in New York.  It was his native place; but\r\nhe had not been there for many years.  He had been knocking about the\r\nworld, and living in far-away lands; he had only come back a month or two\r\nbefore.  New York was very pleasant, only he felt lonely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, people forget you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling at Catherine with his\r\ndelightful gaze, while he leaned forward obliquely, turning towards her,\r\nwith his elbows on his knees.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Catherine that no one who had once seen him would ever\r\nforget him; but though she made this reflexion she kept it to herself,\r\nalmost as you would keep something precious.\r\n\r\nThey sat there for some time.  He was very amusing.  He asked her about\r\nthe people that were near them; he tried to guess who some of them were,\r\nand he made the most laughable mistakes.  He criticised them very freely,\r\nin a positive, off-hand way.  Catherine had never heard any\r\none\xe2\x80\x94especially any young man\xe2\x80\x94talk just like that.  It was the way a young\r\nman might talk in a novel; or better still, in a play, on the stage,\r\nclose before the footlights, looking at the audience, and with every one\r\nlooking at him, so that you wondered at his presence of mind.  And yet\r\nMr. Townsend was not like an actor; he seemed so sincere, so natural.\r\nThis was very interesting; but in the midst of it Marian Almond came\r\npushing through the crowd, with a little ironical cry, when she found\r\nthese young people still together, which made every one turn round, and\r\ncost Catherine a conscious blush.  Marian broke up their talk, and told\r\nMr. Townsend\xe2\x80\x94whom she treated as if she were already married, and he had\r\nbecome her cousin\xe2\x80\x94to run away to her mother, who had been wishing for the\r\nlast half-hour to introduce him to Mr. Almond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall meet again!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Catherine as he left her, and Catherine\r\nthought it a very original speech.\r\n\r\nHer cousin took her by the arm, and made her walk about.  \xe2\x80\x9cI needn\xe2\x80\x99t ask\r\nyou what you think of Morris!\xe2\x80\x9d the young girl exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that his name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you what you think of his name, but what you think of\r\nhimself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing particular!\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine answered, dissembling for the first\r\ntime in her life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have half a mind to tell him that!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Marian.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt will do him\r\ngood.  He\xe2\x80\x99s so terribly conceited.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConceited?\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine, staring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo Arthur says, and Arthur knows about him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell him!\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine murmured imploringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell him he\xe2\x80\x99s conceited?  I have told him so a dozen times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this profession of audacity Catherine looked down at her little\r\ncompanion in amazement.  She supposed it was because Marian was going to\r\nbe married that she took so much on herself; but she wondered too,\r\nwhether, when she herself should become engaged, such exploits would be\r\nexpected of her.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later she saw her Aunt Penniman sitting in the embrasure of\r\na window, with her head a little on one side, and her gold eye-glass\r\nraised to her eyes, which were wandering about the room.  In front of her\r\nwas a gentleman, bending forward a little, with his back turned to\r\nCatherine.  She knew his back immediately, though she had never seen it;\r\nfor when he had left her, at Marian\xe2\x80\x99s instigation, he had retreated in\r\nthe best order, without turning round.  Morris Townsend\xe2\x80\x94the name had\r\nalready become very familiar to her, as if some one had been repeating it\r\nin her ear for the last half-hour\xe2\x80\x94Morris Townsend was giving his\r\nimpressions of the company to her aunt, as he had done to herself; he was\r\nsaying clever things, and Mrs. Penniman was smiling, as if she approved\r\nof them.  As soon as Catherine had perceived this she moved away; she\r\nwould not have liked him to turn round and see her.  But it gave her\r\npleasure\xe2\x80\x94the whole thing.  That he should talk with Mrs. Penniman, with\r\nwhom she lived and whom she saw and talked with every day\xe2\x80\x94that seemed to\r\nkeep him near her, and to make him even easier to contemplate than if she\r\nherself had been the object of his civilities; and that Aunt Lavinia\r\nshould like him, should not be shocked or startled by what he said, this\r\nalso appeared to the girl a personal gain; for Aunt Lavinia\xe2\x80\x99s standard\r\nwas extremely high, planted as it was over the grave of her late husband,\r\nin which, as she had convinced every one, the very genius of conversation\r\nwas buried.  One of the Almond boys, as Catherine called him, invited our\r\nheroine to dance a quadrille, and for a quarter of an hour her feet at\r\nleast were occupied.  This time she was not dizzy; her head was very\r\nclear.  Just when the dance was over, she found herself in the crowd face\r\nto face with her father.  Dr. Sloper had usually a little smile, never a\r\nvery big one, and with his little smile playing in his clear eyes and on\r\nhis neatly-shaved lips, he looked at his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s crimson gown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that this magnificent person is my child?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nYou would have surprised him if you had told him so; but it is a literal\r\nfact that he almost never addressed his daughter save in the ironical\r\nform.  Whenever he addressed her he gave her pleasure; but she had to cut\r\nher pleasure out of the piece, as it were.  There were portions left\r\nover, light remnants and snippets of irony, which she never knew what to\r\ndo with, which seemed too delicate for her own use; and yet Catherine,\r\nlamenting the limitations of her understanding, felt that they were too\r\nvaluable to waste and had a belief that if they passed over her head they\r\nyet contributed to the general sum of human wisdom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not magnificent,\xe2\x80\x9d she said mildly, wishing that she had put on\r\nanother dress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are sumptuous, opulent, expensive,\xe2\x80\x9d her father rejoined.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou look\r\nas if you had eighty thousand a year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, so long as I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine illogically.  Her conception\r\nof her prospective wealth was as yet very indefinite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo long as you haven\xe2\x80\x99t you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look as if you had.  Have you\r\nenjoyed your party?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine hesitated a moment; and then, looking away, \xe2\x80\x9cI am rather\r\ntired,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.  I have said that this entertainment was the\r\nbeginning of something important for Catherine.  For the second time in\r\nher life she made an indirect answer; and the beginning of a period of\r\ndissimulation is certainly a significant date.  Catherine was not so\r\neasily tired as that.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in the carriage, as they drove home, she was as quiet as if\r\nfatigue had been her portion.  Dr. Sloper\xe2\x80\x99s manner of addressing his\r\nsister Lavinia had a good deal of resemblance to the tone he had adopted\r\ntowards Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was the young man that was making love to you?\xe2\x80\x9d he presently asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my good brother!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mrs. Penniman, in deprecation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seemed uncommonly tender.  Whenever I looked at you, for half an\r\nhour, he had the most devoted air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devotion was not to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt was to Catherine;\r\nhe talked to me of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine had been listening with all her ears.  \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Aunt Penniman!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexclaimed faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is very handsome; he is very clever; he expressed himself with a\r\ngreat deal\xe2\x80\x94a great deal of felicity,\xe2\x80\x9d her aunt went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is in love with this regal creature, then?\xe2\x80\x9d the Doctor inquired\r\nhumorously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, father,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the girl, still more faintly, devoutly thankful the\r\ncarriage was dark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that; but he admired her dress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine did not say to herself in the dark, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dress only?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nPenniman\xe2\x80\x99s announcement struck her by its richness, not by its\r\nmeagreness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father, \xe2\x80\x9che thinks you have eighty thousand a year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he thinks of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman; \xe2\x80\x9che is too\r\nrefined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must be tremendously refined not to think of that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he is!\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine exclaimed, before she knew it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you had gone to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d her father answered.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe hour has\r\ncome!\xe2\x80\x9d he added to himself.  \xe2\x80\x9cLavinia is going to get up a romance for\r\nCatherine.  It\xe2\x80\x99s a shame to play such tricks on the girl.  What is the\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t catch it, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to ask him.  He asked to be\r\nintroduced to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman, with a certain grandeur; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you\r\nknow how indistinctly Jefferson speaks.\xe2\x80\x9d  Jefferson was Mr. Almond.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatherine, dear, what was the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a minute, if it had not been for the rumbling of the carriage, you\r\nmight have heard a pin drop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Aunt Lavinia,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine, very softly.  And, with all\r\nhis irony, her father believed her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nHE learned what he had asked some three or four days later, after Morris\r\nTownsend, with his cousin, had called in Washington Square.  Mrs.\r\nPenniman did not tell her brother, on the drive home, that she had\r\nintimated to this agreeable young man, whose name she did not know, that,\r\nwith her niece, she should be very glad to see him; but she was greatly\r\npleased, and even a little flattered, when, late on a Sunday afternoon,\r\nthe two gentlemen made their appearance.  His coming with Arthur Townsend\r\nmade it more natural and easy; the latter young man was on the point of\r\nbecoming connected with the family, and Mrs. Penniman had remarked to\r\nCatherine that, as he was going to marry Marian, it would be polite in\r\nhim to call.  These events came to pass late in the autumn, and Catherine\r\nand her aunt had been sitting together in the closing dusk, by the\r\nfirelight, in the high back parlour.\r\n\r\nArthur Townsend fell to Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s portion, while his companion placed\r\nhimself on the sofa, beside Mrs. Penniman.  Catherine had hitherto not\r\nbeen a harsh critic; she was easy to please\xe2\x80\x94she liked to talk with young\r\nmen.  But Marian\xe2\x80\x99s betrothed, this evening, made her feel vaguely\r\nfastidious; he sat looking at the fire and rubbing his knees with his\r\nhands.  As for Catherine, she scarcely even pretended to keep up the\r\nconversation; her attention had fixed itself on the other side of the\r\nroom; she was listening to what went on between the other Mr. Townsend\r\nand her aunt.  Every now and then he looked over at Catherine herself and\r\nsmiled, as if to show that what he said was for her benefit too.\r\nCatherine would have liked to change her place, to go and sit near them,\r\nwhere she might see and hear him better.  But she was afraid of seeming\r\nbold\xe2\x80\x94of looking eager; and, besides, it would not have been polite to\r\nMarian\xe2\x80\x99s little suitor.  She wondered why the other gentleman had picked\r\nout her aunt\xe2\x80\x94how he came to have so much to say to Mrs. Penniman, to\r\nwhom, usually, young men were not especially devoted.  She was not at all\r\njealous of Aunt Lavinia, but she was a little envious, and above all she\r\nwondered; for Morris Townsend was an object on which she found that her\r\nimagination could exercise itself indefinitely.  His cousin had been\r\ndescribing a house that he had taken in view of his union with Marian,\r\nand the domestic conveniences he meant to introduce into it; how Marian\r\nwanted a larger one, and Mrs. Almond recommended a smaller one, and how\r\nhe himself was convinced that he had got the neatest house in New York.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s only for three or four years.  At the\r\nend of three or four years we\xe2\x80\x99ll move.  That\xe2\x80\x99s the way to live in New\r\nYork\xe2\x80\x94to move every three or four years.  Then you always get the last\r\nthing.  It\xe2\x80\x99s because the city\xe2\x80\x99s growing so quick\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to keep up\r\nwith it.  It\xe2\x80\x99s going straight up town\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s where New York\xe2\x80\x99s going.  If\r\nI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t afraid Marian would be lonely, I\xe2\x80\x99d go up there\xe2\x80\x94right up to the\r\ntop\xe2\x80\x94and wait for it.  Only have to wait ten years\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99d all come up\r\nafter you.  But Marian says she wants some neighbours\xe2\x80\x94she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nbe a pioneer.  She says that if she\xe2\x80\x99s got to be the first settler she had\r\nbetter go out to Minnesota.  I guess we\xe2\x80\x99ll move up little by little; when\r\nwe get tired of one street we\xe2\x80\x99ll go higher.  So you see we\xe2\x80\x99ll always have\r\na new house; it\xe2\x80\x99s a great advantage to have a new house; you get all the\r\nlatest improvements.  They invent everything all over again about every\r\nfive years, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a great thing to keep up with the new things.  I\r\nalways try and keep up with the new things of every kind.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nthink that\xe2\x80\x99s a good motto for a young couple\xe2\x80\x94to keep \xe2\x80\x98going higher\xe2\x80\x99?\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the name of that piece of poetry\xe2\x80\x94what do they call\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x94_Excelsior_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine bestowed on her junior visitor only just enough attention to\r\nfeel that this was not the way Mr. Morris Townsend had talked the other\r\nnight, or that he was talking now to her fortunate aunt.  But suddenly\r\nhis aspiring kinsman became more interesting.  He seemed to have become\r\nconscious that she was affected by his companion\xe2\x80\x99s presence, and he\r\nthought it proper to explain it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy cousin asked me to bring him, or I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have taken the liberty.\r\nHe seemed to want very much to come; you know he\xe2\x80\x99s awfully sociable.  I\r\ntold him I wanted to ask you first, but he said Mrs. Penniman had invited\r\nhim.  He isn\xe2\x80\x99t particular what he says when he wants to come somewhere!\r\nBut Mrs. Penniman seems to think it\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are very glad to see him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.  And she wished to talk\r\nmore about him; but she hardly knew what to say.  \xe2\x80\x9cI never saw him\r\nbefore,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on presently.\r\n\r\nArthur Townsend stared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he told me he talked with you for over half an hour the other\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean before the other night.  That was the first time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he has been away from New York\xe2\x80\x94he has been all round the world.  He\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t know many people here, but he\xe2\x80\x99s very sociable, and he wants to\r\nknow every one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery one?\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I mean all the good ones.  All the pretty young ladies\xe2\x80\x94like Mrs.\r\nPenniman!\xe2\x80\x9d and Arthur Townsend gave a private laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy aunt likes him very much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost people like him\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s so brilliant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s more like a foreigner,\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I never knew a foreigner!\xe2\x80\x9d said young Townsend, in a tone which\r\nseemed to indicate that his ignorance had been optional.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither have I,\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine confessed, with more humility.  \xe2\x80\x9cThey say\r\nthey are generally brilliant,\xe2\x80\x9d she added vaguely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the people of this city are clever enough for me.  I know some of\r\nthem that think they are too clever for me; but they ain\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you can\xe2\x80\x99t be too clever,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine, still with humility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.  I know some people that call my cousin too clever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine listened to this statement with extreme interest, and a feeling\r\nthat if Morris Townsend had a fault it would naturally be that one.  But\r\nshe did not commit herself, and in a moment she asked: \xe2\x80\x9cNow that he has\r\ncome back, will he stay here always?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, \xe2\x80\x9cif he can get something to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome place or other; some business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t he got any?\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine, who had never heard of a young\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94of the upper class\xe2\x80\x94in this situation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; he\xe2\x80\x99s looking round.  But he can\xe2\x80\x99t find anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine permitted herself to observe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said young Townsend.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe takes it easy\xe2\x80\x94he isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nin a hurry.  He is very particular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine thought he naturally would be, and gave herself up for some\r\nmoments to the contemplation of this idea, in several of its bearings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t his father take him into his business\xe2\x80\x94his office?\xe2\x80\x9d she at last\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got any father\xe2\x80\x94he has only got a sister.  Your sister can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp you much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Catherine that if she were his sister she would disprove\r\nthis axiom.  \xe2\x80\x9cIs she\xe2\x80\x94is she pleasant?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked in a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94I believe she\xe2\x80\x99s very respectable,\xe2\x80\x9d said young Townsend.\r\nAnd then he looked across to his cousin and began to laugh.  \xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\r\nwe are talking about you,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\nMorris Townsend paused in his conversation with Mrs. Penniman, and\r\nstared, with a little smile.  Then he got up, as if he were going.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as you are concerned, I can\xe2\x80\x99t return the compliment,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to\r\nCatherine\xe2\x80\x99s companion.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut as regards Miss Sloper, it\xe2\x80\x99s another\r\naffair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine thought this little speech wonderfully well turned; but she was\r\nembarrassed by it, and she also got up.  Morris Townsend stood looking at\r\nher and smiling; he put out his hand for farewell.  He was going, without\r\nhaving said anything to her; but even on these terms she was glad to have\r\nseen him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell her what you have said\xe2\x80\x94when you go!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman,\r\nwith an insinuating laugh.\r\n\r\nCatherine blushed, for she felt almost as if they were making sport of\r\nher.  What in the world could this beautiful young man have said?  He\r\nlooked at her still, in spite of her blush; but very kindly and\r\nrespectfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had no talk with you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand that was what I came for.\r\nBut it will be a good reason for coming another time; a little pretext\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nI am obliged to give one.  I am not afraid of what your aunt will say\r\nwhen I go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this the two young men took their departure; after which Catherine,\r\nwith her blush still lingering, directed a serious and interrogative eye\r\nto Mrs. Penniman.  She was incapable of elaborate artifice, and she\r\nresorted to no jocular device\xe2\x80\x94to no affectation of the belief that she\r\nhad been maligned\xe2\x80\x94to learn what she desired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you say you would tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman came up to her, smiling and nodding a little, looked at her\r\nall over, and gave a twist to the knot of ribbon in her neck.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngreat secret, my dear child; but he is coming a-courting!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine was serious still.  \xe2\x80\x9cIs that what he told you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t say so exactly.  But he left me to guess it.  I\xe2\x80\x99m a good\r\nguesser.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean a-courting me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot me, certainly, miss; though I must say he is a hundred times more\r\npolite to a person who has no longer extreme youth to recommend her than\r\nmost of the young men.  He is thinking of some one else.\xe2\x80\x9d  And Mrs.\r\nPenniman gave her niece a delicate little kiss.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou must be very\r\ngracious to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine stared\xe2\x80\x94she was bewildered.  \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9che doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, he does; more than you think.  I have told him all about you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Aunt Penniman!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Catherine, as if this had been a breach of\r\ntrust.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a perfect stranger\xe2\x80\x94we don\xe2\x80\x99t know him.\xe2\x80\x9d  There was\r\ninfinite, modesty in the poor girl\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAunt Penniman, however, took no account of it; she spoke even with a\r\ntouch of acrimony.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Catherine, you know very well that you\r\nadmire him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Aunt Penniman!\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine could only murmur again.  It might very\r\nwell be that she admired him\xe2\x80\x94though this did not seem to her a thing to\r\ntalk about.  But that this brilliant stranger\xe2\x80\x94this sudden apparition, who\r\nhad barely heard the sound of her voice\xe2\x80\x94took that sort of interest in her\r\nthat was expressed by the romantic phrase of which Mrs. Penniman had just\r\nmade use: this could only be a figment of the restless brain of Aunt\r\nLavinia, whom every one knew to be a woman of powerful imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. PENNIMAN even took for granted at times that other people had as\r\nmuch imagination as herself; so that when, half an hour later, her\r\nbrother came in, she addressed him quite on this principle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has just been here, Austin; it\xe2\x80\x99s such a pity you missed him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom in the world have I missed?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Morris Townsend; he has made us such a delightful visit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who in the world is Mr. Morris Townsend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt Penniman means the gentleman\xe2\x80\x94the gentleman whose name I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nremember,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gentleman at Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s party who was so struck with Catherine,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMrs. Penniman added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, his name is Morris Townsend, is it?  And did he come here to propose\r\nto you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, father,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the girl for all answer, turning away to the\r\nwindow, where the dusk had deepened to darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope he won\xe2\x80\x99t do that without your permission,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman,\r\nvery graciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, my dear, he seems to have yours,\xe2\x80\x9d her brother answered.\r\n\r\nLavinia simpered, as if this might not be quite enough, and Catherine,\r\nwith her forehead touching the window-panes, listened to this exchange of\r\nepigrams as reservedly as if they had not each been a pin-prick in her\r\nown destiny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next time he comes,\xe2\x80\x9d the Doctor added, \xe2\x80\x9cyou had better call me.  He\r\nmight like to see me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris Townsend came again, some five days afterwards; but Dr. Sloper was\r\nnot called, as he was absent from home at the time.  Catherine was with\r\nher aunt when the young man\xe2\x80\x99s name was brought in, and Mrs. Penniman,\r\neffacing herself and protesting, made a great point of her niece\xe2\x80\x99s going\r\ninto the drawing-room alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis time it\xe2\x80\x99s for you\xe2\x80\x94for you only,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.  \xe2\x80\x9cBefore, when he talked\r\nto me, it was only preliminary\xe2\x80\x94it was to gain my confidence.  Literally,\r\nmy dear, I should not have the _courage_ to show myself to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd this was perfectly true.  Mrs. Penniman was not a brave woman, and\r\nMorris Townsend had struck her as a young man of great force of\r\ncharacter, and of remarkable powers of satire; a keen, resolute,\r\nbrilliant nature, with which one must exercise a great deal of tact.  She\r\nsaid to herself that he was \xe2\x80\x9cimperious,\xe2\x80\x9d and she liked the word and the\r\nidea.  She was not the least jealous of her niece, and she had been\r\nperfectly happy with Mr. Penniman, but in the bottom of her heart she\r\npermitted herself the observation: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of husband I should\r\nhave had!\xe2\x80\x9d  He was certainly much more imperious\xe2\x80\x94she ended by calling it\r\nimperial\xe2\x80\x94than Mr. Penniman.\r\n\r\nSo Catherine saw Mr. Townsend alone, and her aunt did not come in even at\r\nthe end of the visit.  The visit was a long one; he sat there\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\nfront parlour, in the biggest armchair\xe2\x80\x94for more than an hour.  He seemed\r\nmore at home this time\xe2\x80\x94more familiar; lounging a little in the chair,\r\nslapping a cushion that was near him with his stick, and looking round\r\nthe room a good deal, and at the objects it contained, as well as at\r\nCatherine; whom, however, he also contemplated freely.  There was a smile\r\nof respectful devotion in his handsome eyes which seemed to Catherine\r\nalmost solemnly beautiful; it made her think of a young knight in a poem.\r\nHis talk, however, was not particularly knightly; it was light and easy\r\nand friendly; it took a practical turn, and he asked a number of\r\nquestions about herself\xe2\x80\x94what were her tastes\xe2\x80\x94if she liked this and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94what were her habits.  He said to her, with his charming smile,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me about yourself; give me a little sketch.\xe2\x80\x9d  Catherine had very\r\nlittle to tell, and she had no talent for sketching; but before he went\r\nshe had confided to him that she had a secret passion for the theatre,\r\nwhich had been but scantily gratified, and a taste for operatic\r\nmusic\xe2\x80\x94that of Bellini and Donizetti, in especial (it must be remembered\r\nin extenuation of this primitive young woman that she held these opinions\r\nin an age of general darkness)\xe2\x80\x94which she rarely had an occasion to hear,\r\nexcept on the hand-organ.  She confessed that she was not particularly\r\nfond of literature.  Morris Townsend agreed with her that books were\r\ntiresome things; only, as he said, you had to read a good many before you\r\nfound it out.  He had been to places that people had written books about,\r\nand they were not a bit like the descriptions.  To see for yourself\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nwas the great thing; he always tried to see for himself.  He had seen all\r\nthe principal actors\xe2\x80\x94he had been to all the best theatres in London and\r\nParis.  But the actors were always like the authors\xe2\x80\x94they always\r\nexaggerated.  He liked everything to be natural.  Suddenly he stopped,\r\nlooking at Catherine with his smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I like you for; you are so natural!  Excuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d he added;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou see I am natural myself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd before she had time to think whether she excused him or not\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nafterwards, at leisure, she became conscious that she did\xe2\x80\x94he began to\r\ntalk about music, and to say that it was his greatest pleasure in life.\r\nHe had heard all the great singers in Paris and London\xe2\x80\x94Pasta and Rubini\r\nand Lablache\xe2\x80\x94and when you had done that, you could say that you knew what\r\nsinging was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sing a little myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9csome day I will show you.  Not\r\nto-day, but some other time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then he got up to go; he had omitted, by accident, to say that he\r\nwould sing to her if she would play to him.  He thought of this after he\r\ngot into the street; but he might have spared his compunction, for\r\nCatherine had not noticed the lapse.  She was thinking only that \xe2\x80\x9csome\r\nother time\xe2\x80\x9d had a delightful sound; it seemed to spread itself over the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThis was all the more reason, however, though she was ashamed and\r\nuncomfortable, why she should tell her father that Mr. Morris Townsend\r\nhad called again.  She announced the fact abruptly, almost violently, as\r\nsoon as the Doctor came into the house; and having done so\xe2\x80\x94it was her\r\nduty\xe2\x80\x94she took measures to leave the room.  But she could not leave it\r\nfast enough; her father stopped her just as she reached the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear, did he propose to you to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d the Doctor asked.\r\n\r\nThis was just what she had been afraid he would say; and yet she had no\r\nanswer ready.  Of course she would have liked to take it as a joke\xe2\x80\x94as her\r\nfather must have meant it; and yet she would have liked, also, in denying\r\nit, to be a little positive, a little sharp; so that he would perhaps not\r\nask the question again.  She didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it\xe2\x80\x94it made her unhappy.  But\r\nCatherine could never be sharp; and for a moment she only stood, with her\r\nhand on the door-knob, looking at her satiric parent, and giving a little\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecidedly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cmy daughter is not brilliant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he had no sooner made this reflexion than Catherine found something;\r\nshe had decided, on the whole, to take the thing as a joke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he will do it the next time!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, with a repetition\r\nof her laugh.  And she quickly got out of the room.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor stood staring; he wondered whether his daughter were serious.\r\nCatherine went straight to her own room, and by the time she reached it\r\nshe bethought herself that there was something else\xe2\x80\x94something better\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nmight have said.  She almost wished, now, that her father would ask his\r\nquestion again, so that she might reply: \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, Mr. Morris Townsend\r\nproposed to me, and I refused him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, however, began to put his questions elsewhere; it naturally\r\nhaving occurred to him that he ought to inform himself properly about\r\nthis handsome young man who had formed the habit of running in and out of\r\nhis house.  He addressed himself to the younger of his sisters, Mrs.\r\nAlmond\xe2\x80\x94not going to her for the purpose; there was no such hurry as\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94but having made a note of the matter for the first opportunity.  The\r\nDoctor was never eager, never impatient nor nervous; but he made notes of\r\neverything, and he regularly consulted his notes.  Among them the\r\ninformation he obtained from Mrs. Almond about Morris Townsend took its\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLavinia has already been to ask me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.  \xe2\x80\x9cLavinia is most\r\nexcited; I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it.  It\xe2\x80\x99s not, after all, Lavinia that the\r\nyoung man is supposed to have designs upon.  She is very peculiar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d the Doctor replied, \xe2\x80\x9cshe has not lived with me these\r\ntwelve years without my finding it out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has got such an artificial mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Almond, who always\r\nenjoyed an opportunity to discuss Lavinia\xe2\x80\x99s peculiarities with her\r\nbrother.  \xe2\x80\x9cShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t want me to tell you that she had asked me about Mr.\r\nTownsend; but I told her I would.  She always wants to conceal\r\neverything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet at moments no one blurts things out with such crudity.  She is\r\nlike a revolving lighthouse; pitch darkness alternating with a dazzling\r\nbrilliancy!  But what did you tell her?\xe2\x80\x9d the Doctor asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I tell you; that I know very little of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLavinia must have been disappointed at that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor; \xe2\x80\x9cshe\r\nwould prefer him to have been guilty of some romantic crime.  However, we\r\nmust make the best of people.  They tell me our gentleman is the cousin\r\nof the little boy to whom you are about to entrust the future of your\r\nlittle girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArthur is not a little boy; he is a very old man; you and I will never\r\nbe so old.  He is a distant relation of Lavinia\xe2\x80\x99s _prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9_.  The name is\r\nthe same, but I am given to understand that there are Townsends and\r\nTownsends.  So Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s mother tells me; she talked about\r\n\xe2\x80\x98branches\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94younger branches, elder branches, inferior branches\xe2\x80\x94as if it\r\nwere a royal house.  Arthur, it appears, is of the reigning line, but\r\npoor Lavinia\xe2\x80\x99s young man is not.  Beyond this, Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s mother knows very\r\nlittle about him; she has only a vague story that he has been \xe2\x80\x98wild.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBut I know his sister a little, and she is a very nice woman.  Her name\r\nis Mrs. Montgomery; she is a widow, with a little property and five\r\nchildren.  She lives in the Second Avenue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does Mrs. Montgomery say about him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat he has talents by which he might distinguish himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly he is lazy, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s family pride,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is his profession?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got any; he is looking for something.  I believe he was once\r\nin the Navy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce?  What is his age?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose he is upwards of thirty.  He must have gone into the Navy very\r\nyoung.  I think Arthur told me that he inherited a small property\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nwas perhaps the cause of his leaving the Navy\xe2\x80\x94and that he spent it all in\r\na few years.  He travelled all over the world, lived abroad, amused\r\nhimself.  I believe it was a kind of system, a theory he had.  He has\r\nlately come back to America, with the intention, as he tells Arthur, of\r\nbeginning life in earnest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he in earnest about Catherine, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you should be incredulous,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Almond.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems\r\nto me that you have never done Catherine justice.  You must remember that\r\nshe has the prospect of thirty thousand a year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor looked at his sister a moment, and then, with the slightest\r\ntouch of bitterness: \xe2\x80\x9cYou at least appreciate her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nMrs. Almond blushed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that is her only merit; I simply mean that it is a great\r\none.  A great many young men think so; and you appear to me never to have\r\nbeen properly aware of that.  You have always had a little way of\r\nalluding to her as an unmarriageable girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy allusions are as kind as yours, Elizabeth,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor frankly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many suitors has Catherine had, with all her expectations\xe2\x80\x94how much\r\nattention has she ever received?  Catherine is not unmarriageable, but\r\nshe is absolutely unattractive.  What other reason is there for Lavinia\r\nbeing so charmed with the idea that there is a lover in the house?  There\r\nhas never been one before, and Lavinia, with her sensitive, sympathetic\r\nnature, is not used to the idea.  It affects her imagination.  I must do\r\nthe young men of New York the justice to say that they strike me as very\r\ndisinterested.  They prefer pretty girls\xe2\x80\x94lively girls\xe2\x80\x94girls like your\r\nown.  Catherine is neither pretty nor lively.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatherine does very well; she has a style of her own\xe2\x80\x94which is more than\r\nmy poor Marian has, who has no style at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Almond.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nreason Catherine has received so little attention is that she seems to\r\nall the young men to be older than themselves.  She is so large, and she\r\ndresses\xe2\x80\x94so richly.  They are rather afraid of her, I think; she looks as\r\nif she had been married already, and you know they don\xe2\x80\x99t like married\r\nwomen.  And if our young men appear disinterested,\xe2\x80\x9d the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s wiser\r\nsister went on, \xe2\x80\x9cit is because they marry, as a general thing, so young;\r\nbefore twenty-five, at the age of innocence and sincerity, before the age\r\nof calculation.  If they only waited a little, Catherine would fare\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a calculation?  Thank you very much,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait till some intelligent man of forty comes along, and he will be\r\ndelighted with Catherine,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Almond continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Townsend is not old enough, then; his motives may be pure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very possible that his motives are pure; I should be very sorry to\r\ntake the contrary for granted.  Lavinia is sure of it, and, as he is a\r\nvery prepossessing youth, you might give him the benefit of the doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr. Sloper reflected a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are his present means of subsistence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no idea.  He lives, as I say, with his sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA widow, with five children?  Do you mean he lives _upon_ her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Almond got up, and with a certain impatience: \xe2\x80\x9cHad you not better\r\nask Mrs. Montgomery herself?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I may come to that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor.  \xe2\x80\x9cDid you say the Second\r\nAvenue?\xe2\x80\x9d  He made a note of the Second Avenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nHE was, however, by no means so much in earnest as this might seem to\r\nindicate; and, indeed, he was more than anything else amused with the\r\nwhole situation.  He was not in the least in a state of tension or of\r\nvigilance with regard to Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s prospects; he was even on his guard\r\nagainst the ridicule that might attach itself to the spectacle of a house\r\nthrown into agitation by its daughter and heiress receiving attentions\r\nunprecedented in its annals.  More than this, he went so far as to\r\npromise himself some entertainment from the little drama\xe2\x80\x94if drama it\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94of which Mrs. Penniman desired to represent the ingenious Mr.\r\nTownsend as the hero.  He had no intention, as yet, of regulating the\r\n_d\xc3\xa9nouement_.  He was perfectly willing, as Elizabeth had suggested, to\r\ngive the young man the benefit of every doubt.  There was no great danger\r\nin it; for Catherine, at the age of twenty-two, was, after all, a rather\r\nmature blossom, such as could be plucked from the stem only by a vigorous\r\njerk.  The fact that Morris Townsend was poor\xe2\x80\x94was not of necessity\r\nagainst him; the Doctor had never made up his mind that his daughter\r\nshould marry a rich man.  The fortune she would inherit struck him as a\r\nvery sufficient provision for two reasonable persons, and if a penniless\r\nswain who could give a good account of himself should enter the lists, he\r\nshould be judged quite upon his personal merits.  There were other things\r\nbesides.  The Doctor thought it very vulgar to be precipitate in accusing\r\npeople of mercenary motives, inasmuch as his door had as yet not been in\r\nthe least besieged by fortune-hunters; and, lastly, he was very curious\r\nto see whether Catherine might really be loved for her moral worth.  He\r\nsmiled as he reflected that poor Mr. Townsend had been only twice to the\r\nhouse, and he said to Mrs. Penniman that the next time he should come she\r\nmust ask him to dinner.\r\n\r\nHe came very soon again, and Mrs. Penniman had of course great pleasure\r\nin executing this mission.  Morris Townsend accepted her invitation with\r\nequal good grace, and the dinner took place a few days later.  The Doctor\r\nhad said to himself, justly enough, that they must not have the young man\r\nalone; this would partake too much of the nature of encouragement.  So\r\ntwo or three other persons were invited; but Morris Townsend, though he\r\nwas by no means the ostensible, was the real, occasion of the feast.\r\nThere is every reason to suppose that he desired to make a good\r\nimpression; and if he fell short of this result, it was not for want of a\r\ngood deal of intelligent effort.  The Doctor talked to him very little\r\nduring dinner; but he observed him attentively, and after the ladies had\r\ngone out he pushed him the wine and asked him several questions.  Morris\r\nwas not a young man who needed to be pressed, and he found quite enough\r\nencouragement in the superior quality of the claret.  The Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s wine\r\nwas admirable, and it may be communicated to the reader that while he\r\nsipped it Morris reflected that a cellar-full of good liquor\xe2\x80\x94there was\r\nevidently a cellar-full here\xe2\x80\x94would be a most attractive idiosyncrasy in a\r\nfather-in-law.  The Doctor was struck with his appreciative guest; he saw\r\nthat he was not a commonplace young man.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe has ability,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nCatherine\xe2\x80\x99s father, \xe2\x80\x9cdecided ability; he has a very good head if he\r\nchooses to use it.  And he is uncommonly well turned out; quite the sort\r\nof figure that pleases the ladies.  But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I like him.\xe2\x80\x9d  The\r\nDoctor, however, kept his reflexions to himself, and talked to his\r\nvisitors about foreign lands, concerning which Morris offered him more\r\ninformation than he was ready, as he mentally phrased it, to swallow.\r\nDr. Sloper had travelled but little, and he took the liberty of not\r\nbelieving everything this anecdotical idler narrated.  He prided himself\r\non being something of a physiognomist, and while the young man, chatting\r\nwith easy assurance, puffed his cigar and filled his glass again, the\r\nDoctor sat with his eyes quietly fixed on his bright, expressive face.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has the assurance of the devil himself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris\xe2\x80\x99s host; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink I ever saw such assurance.  And his powers of invention are most\r\nremarkable.  He is very knowing; they were not so knowing as that in my\r\ntime.  And a good head, did I say?  I should think so\xe2\x80\x94after a bottle of\r\nMadeira and a bottle and a half of claret!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Morris Townsend went and stood before Catherine, who was\r\nstanding before the fire in her red satin gown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like me\xe2\x80\x94he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like me at all!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father; extraordinary man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see how you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine, blushing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel; I am very quick to feel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you are mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well; you ask him and you will see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather not ask him, if there is any danger of his saying what\r\nyou think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris looked at her with an air of mock melancholy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give you any pleasure to contradict him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never contradict him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you hear me abused without opening your lips in my defence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father won\xe2\x80\x99t abuse you.  He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know you enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris Townsend gave a loud laugh, and Catherine began to blush again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall never mention you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, to take refuge from her confusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is very well; but it is not quite what I should have liked you to\r\nsay.  I should have liked you to say: \xe2\x80\x98If my father doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think well of\r\nyou, what does it matter?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but it would matter; I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that!\xe2\x80\x9d the girl exclaimed.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her for a moment, smiling a little; and the Doctor, if he\r\nhad been watching him just then, would have seen a gleam of fine\r\nimpatience in the sociable softness of his eye.  But there was no\r\nimpatience in his rejoinder\xe2\x80\x94none, at least, save what was expressed in a\r\nlittle appealing sigh.  \xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, then, I must not give up the hope of\r\nbringing him round!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe expressed it more frankly to Mrs. Penniman later in the evening.  But\r\nbefore that he sang two or three songs at Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s timid request; not\r\nthat he flattered himself that this would help to bring her father round.\r\nHe had a sweet, light tenor voice, and when he had finished every one\r\nmade some exclamation\xe2\x80\x94every one, that is, save Catherine, who remained\r\nintensely silent.  Mrs. Penniman declared that his manner of singing was\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmost artistic,\xe2\x80\x9d and Dr. Sloper said it was \xe2\x80\x9cvery taking\xe2\x80\x94very taking\r\nindeed\xe2\x80\x9d; speaking loudly and distinctly, but with a certain dryness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like me\xe2\x80\x94he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like me at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris Townsend,\r\naddressing the aunt in the same manner as he had done the niece.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nthinks I\xe2\x80\x99m all wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnlike her niece, Mrs. Penniman asked for no explanation.  She only\r\nsmiled very sweetly, as if she understood everything; and, unlike\r\nCatherine too, she made no attempt to contradict him.  \xe2\x80\x9cPray, what does\r\nit matter?\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you say the right thing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris, greatly to the gratification\r\nof Mrs. Penniman, who prided herself on always saying the right thing.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, the next time he saw his sister Elizabeth, let her know that\r\nhe had made the acquaintance of Lavinia\xe2\x80\x99s _prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhysically,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s uncommonly well set up.  As an anatomist, it\r\nis really a pleasure to me to see such a beautiful structure; although,\r\nif people were all like him, I suppose there would be very little need\r\nfor doctors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see anything in people but their bones?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Almond rejoined.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of him as a father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a father?  Thank Heaven I am not his father!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but you are Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s.  Lavinia tells me she is in love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe must get over it.  He is not a gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, take care!  Remember that he is a branch of the Townsends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not what I call a gentleman.  He has not the soul of one.  He is\r\nextremely insinuating; but it\xe2\x80\x99s a vulgar nature.  I saw through it in a\r\nminute.  He is altogether too familiar\xe2\x80\x94I hate familiarity.  He is a\r\nplausible coxcomb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Almond; \xe2\x80\x9cif you make up your mind so easily, it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngreat advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t make up my mind easily.  What I tell you is the result of thirty\r\nyears of observation; and in order to be able to form that judgement in a\r\nsingle evening, I have had to spend a lifetime in study.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery possibly you are right.  But the thing is for Catherine to see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will present her with a pair of spectacles!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIF it were true that she was in love, she was certainly very quiet about\r\nit; but the Doctor was of course prepared to admit that her quietness\r\nmight mean volumes.  She had told Morris Townsend that she would not\r\nmention him to her father, and she saw no reason to retract this vow of\r\ndiscretion.  It was no more than decently civil, of course, that after\r\nhaving dined in Washington Square, Morris should call there again; and it\r\nwas no more than natural that, having been kindly received on this\r\noccasion, he should continue to present himself.  He had had plenty of\r\nleisure on his hands; and thirty years ago, in New York, a young man of\r\nleisure had reason to be thankful for aids to self-oblivion.  Catherine\r\nsaid nothing to her father about these visits, though they had rapidly\r\nbecome the most important, the most absorbing thing in her life.  The\r\ngirl was very happy.  She knew not as yet what would come of it; but the\r\npresent had suddenly grown rich and solemn.  If she had been told she was\r\nin love, she would have been a good deal surprised; for she had an idea\r\nthat love was an eager and exacting passion, and her own heart was filled\r\nin these days with the impulse of self-effacement and sacrifice.\r\nWhenever Morris Townsend had left the house, her imagination projected\r\nitself, with all its strength, into the idea of his soon coming back; but\r\nif she had been told at such a moment that he would not return for a\r\nyear, or even that he would never return, she would not have complained\r\nnor rebelled, but would have humbly accepted the decree, and sought for\r\nconsolation in thinking over the times she had already seen him, the\r\nwords he had spoken, the sound of his voice, of his tread, the expression\r\nof his face.  Love demands certain things as a right; but Catherine had\r\nno sense of her rights; she had only a consciousness of immense and\r\nunexpected favours.  Her very gratitude for these things had hushed\r\nitself; for it seemed to her that there would be something of impudence\r\nin making a festival of her secret.  Her father suspected Morris\r\nTownsend\xe2\x80\x99s visits, and noted her reserve.  She seemed to beg pardon for\r\nit; she looked at him constantly in silence, as if she meant to say that\r\nshe said nothing because she was afraid of irritating him.  But the poor\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s dumb eloquence irritated him more than anything else would have\r\ndone, and he caught himself murmuring more than once that it was a\r\ngrievous pity his only child was a simpleton.  His murmurs, however, were\r\ninaudible; and for a while he said nothing to any one.  He would have\r\nliked to know exactly how often young Townsend came; but he had\r\ndetermined to ask no questions of the girl herself\xe2\x80\x94to say nothing more to\r\nher that would show that he watched her.  The Doctor had a great idea of\r\nbeing largely just: he wished to leave his daughter her liberty, and\r\ninterfere only when the danger should be proved.  It was not in his\r\nmanner to obtain information by indirect methods, and it never even\r\noccurred to him to question the servants.  As for Lavinia, he hated to\r\ntalk to her about the matter; she annoyed him with her mock romanticism.\r\nBut he had to come to this.  Mrs. Penniman\xe2\x80\x99s convictions as regards the\r\nrelations of her niece and the clever young visitor who saved appearances\r\nby coming ostensibly for both the ladies\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Penniman\xe2\x80\x99s convictions had\r\npassed into a riper and richer phase.  There was to be no crudity in Mrs.\r\nPenniman\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of the situation; she had become as uncommunicative\r\nas Catherine herself.  She was tasting of the sweets of concealment; she\r\nhad taken up the line of mystery.  \xe2\x80\x9cShe would be enchanted to be able to\r\nprove to herself that she is persecuted,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor; and when at\r\nlast he questioned her, he was sure she would contrive to extract from\r\nhis words a pretext for this belief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe so good as to let me know what is going on in the house,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to\r\nher, in a tone which, under the circumstances, he himself deemed genial.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing on, Austin?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Penniman exclaimed.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I am sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow!  I believe that last night the old grey cat had kittens!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt her age?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe idea is startling\xe2\x80\x94almost shocking.\r\nBe so good as to see that they are all drowned.  But what else has\r\nhappened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the dear little kittens!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Penniman.  \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nthem drowned for the world!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer brother puffed his cigar a few moments in silence.  \xe2\x80\x9cYour sympathy\r\nwith kittens, Lavinia,\xe2\x80\x9d he presently resumed, \xe2\x80\x9carises from a feline\r\nelement in your own character.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCats are very graceful, and very clean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd very stealthy.  You are the embodiment both of grace and of\r\nneatness; but you are wanting in frankness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou certainly are not, dear brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to be graceful, though I try to be neat.  Why haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou let me know that Mr. Morris Townsend is coming to the house four\r\ntimes a week?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman lifted her eyebrows.  \xe2\x80\x9cFour times a week?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive times, if you prefer it.  I am away all day, and I see nothing.\r\nBut when such things happen, you should let me know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman, with her eyebrows still raised, reflected intently.  \xe2\x80\x9cDear\r\nAustin,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cI am incapable of betraying a confidence.  I\r\nwould rather suffer anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever fear; you shall not suffer.  To whose confidence is it you allude?\r\nHas Catherine made you take a vow of eternal secrecy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means.  Catherine has not told me as much as she might.  She has\r\nnot been very trustful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the young man, then, who has made you his confidante?  Allow me to\r\nsay that it is extremely indiscreet of you to form secret alliances with\r\nyoung men.  You don\xe2\x80\x99t know where they may lead you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean by an alliance,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman.  \xe2\x80\x9cI take\r\na great interest in Mr. Townsend; I won\xe2\x80\x99t conceal that.  But that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder the circumstances, that is quite enough.  What is the source of\r\nyour interest in Mr. Townsend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman, musing, and then breaking into her smile,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat he is so interesting!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor felt that he had need of his patience.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what makes him\r\ninteresting?\xe2\x80\x94his good looks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis misfortunes, Austin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, he has had misfortunes?  That, of course, is always interesting.\r\nAre you at liberty to mention a few of Mr. Townsend\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that he would like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe has told\r\nme a great deal about himself\xe2\x80\x94he has told me, in fact, his whole history.\r\nBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I ought to repeat those things.  He would tell them to\r\nyou, I am sure, if he thought you would listen to him kindly.  With\r\nkindness you may do anything with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor gave a laugh.  \xe2\x80\x9cI shall request him very kindly, then, to\r\nleave Catherine alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman, shaking her forefinger at her brother, with her\r\nlittle finger turned out, \xe2\x80\x9cCatherine had probably said something to him\r\nkinder than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaid that she loved him?  Do you mean that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman fixed her eyes on the floor.  \xe2\x80\x9cAs I tell you, Austin, she\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t confide in me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have an opinion, I suppose, all the same.  It is that I ask you for;\r\nthough I don\xe2\x80\x99t conceal from you that I shall not regard it as\r\nconclusive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman\xe2\x80\x99s gaze continued to rest on the carpet; but at last she\r\nlifted it, and then her brother thought it very expressive.  \xe2\x80\x9cI think\r\nCatherine is very happy; that is all I can say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTownsend is trying to marry her\xe2\x80\x94is that what you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is greatly interested in her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe finds her such an attractive girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatherine has a lovely nature, Austin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman, \xe2\x80\x9cand Mr.\r\nTownsend has had the intelligence to discover that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith a little help from you, I suppose.  My dear Lavinia,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the\r\nDoctor, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are an admirable aunt!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo Mr. Townsend says,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Lavinia, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think he is sincere?\xe2\x80\x9d asked her brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn saying that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; that\xe2\x80\x99s of course.  But in his admiration for Catherine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeeply sincere.  He has said to me the most appreciative, the most\r\ncharming things about her.  He would say them to you, if he were sure you\r\nwould listen to him\xe2\x80\x94gently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doubt whether I can undertake it.  He appears to require a great deal\r\nof gentleness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a sympathetic, sensitive nature,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman.\r\n\r\nHer brother puffed his cigar again in silence.  \xe2\x80\x9cThese delicate qualities\r\nhave survived his vicissitudes, eh?  All this while you haven\xe2\x80\x99t told me\r\nabout his misfortunes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a long story,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman, \xe2\x80\x9cand I regard it as a sacred\r\ntrust.  But I suppose there is no objection to my saying that he has been\r\nwild\xe2\x80\x94he frankly confesses that.  But he has paid for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what has impoverished him, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean simply in money.  He is very much alone in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean that he has behaved so badly that his friends have given him\r\nup?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has had false friends, who have deceived and betrayed him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seems to have some good ones too.  He has a devoted sister, and\r\nhalf-a-dozen nephews and nieces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman was silent a minute.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe nephews and nieces are children,\r\nand the sister is not a very attractive person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t abuse her to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I am told he\r\nlives upon her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLives upon her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLives with her, and does nothing for himself; it is about the same\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is looking for a position\xe2\x80\x94most earnestly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nhopes every day to find one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely.  He is looking for it here\xe2\x80\x94over there in the front parlour.\r\nThe position of husband of a weak-minded woman with a large fortune would\r\nsuit him to perfection!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman was truly amiable, but she now gave signs of temper.  She\r\nrose with much animation, and stood for a moment looking at her brother.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Austin,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cif you regard Catherine as a weak-minded\r\nwoman, you are particularly mistaken!\xe2\x80\x9d  And with this she moved\r\nmajestically away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was a regular custom with the family in Washington Square to go and\r\nspend Sunday evening at Mrs. Almond\xe2\x80\x99s.  On the Sunday after the\r\nconversation I have just narrated, this custom was not intermitted and on\r\nthis occasion, towards the middle of the evening, Dr. Sloper found reason\r\nto withdraw to the library, with his brother-in-law, to talk over a\r\nmatter of business.  He was absent some twenty minutes, and when he came\r\nback into the circle, which was enlivened by the presence of several\r\nfriends of the family, he saw that Morris Townsend had come in and had\r\nlost as little time as possible in seating himself on a small sofa,\r\nbeside Catherine.  In the large room, where several different groups had\r\nbeen formed, and the hum of voices and of laughter was loud, these two\r\nyoung persons might confabulate, as the Doctor phrased it to himself,\r\nwithout attracting attention.  He saw in a moment, however, that his\r\ndaughter was painfully conscious of his own observation.  She sat\r\nmotionless, with her eyes bent down, staring at her open fan, deeply\r\nflushed, shrinking together as if to minimise the indiscretion of which\r\nshe confessed herself guilty.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor almost pitied her.  Poor Catherine was not defiant; she had no\r\ngenius for bravado; and as she felt that her father viewed her\r\ncompanion\xe2\x80\x99s attentions with an unsympathising eye, there was nothing but\r\ndiscomfort for her in the accident of seeming to challenge him.  The\r\nDoctor felt, indeed, so sorry for her that he turned away, to spare her\r\nthe sense of being watched; and he was so intelligent a man that, in his\r\nthoughts, he rendered a sort of poetic justice to her situation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be deucedly pleasant for a plain inanimate girl like that to\r\nhave a beautiful young fellow come and sit down beside her and whisper to\r\nher that he is her slave\xe2\x80\x94if that is what this one whispers.  No wonder\r\nshe likes it, and that she thinks me a cruel tyrant; which of course she\r\ndoes, though she is afraid\xe2\x80\x94she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the animation necessary\xe2\x80\x94to admit it\r\nto herself.  Poor old Catherine!\xe2\x80\x9d mused the Doctor; \xe2\x80\x9cI verily believe she\r\nis capable of defending me when Townsend abuses me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the force of this reflexion, for the moment, was such in making him\r\nfeel the natural opposition between his point of view and that of an\r\ninfatuated child, that he said to himself that he was perhaps, after all,\r\ntaking things too hard and crying out before he was hurt.  He must not\r\ncondemn Morris Townsend unheard.  He had a great aversion to taking\r\nthings too hard; he thought that half the discomfort and many of the\r\ndisappointments of life come from it; and for an instant he asked himself\r\nwhether, possibly, he did not appear ridiculous to this intelligent young\r\nman, whose private perception of incongruities he suspected of being\r\nkeen.  At the end of a quarter of an hour Catherine had got rid of him,\r\nand Townsend was now standing before the fireplace in conversation with\r\nMrs. Almond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will try him again,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor.  And he crossed the room and\r\njoined his sister and her companion, making her a sign that she should\r\nleave the young man to him.  She presently did so, while Morris looked at\r\nhim, smiling, without a sign of evasiveness in his affable eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s amazingly conceited!\xe2\x80\x9d thought the Doctor; and then he said aloud:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am told you are looking out for a position.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, a position is more than I should presume to call it,\xe2\x80\x9d Morris\r\nTownsend answered.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat sounds so fine.  I should like some quiet\r\nwork\xe2\x80\x94something to turn an honest penny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of thing should you prefer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean what am I fit for?  Very little, I am afraid.  I have\r\nnothing but my good right arm, as they say in the melodramas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are too modest,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn addition to your good right\r\narm, you have your subtle brain.  I know nothing of you but what I see;\r\nbut I see by your physiognomy that you are extremely intelligent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d Townsend murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to answer when you say that!\r\nYou advise me, then, not to despair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he looked at his interlocutor as if the question might have a double\r\nmeaning.  The Doctor caught the look and weighed it a moment before he\r\nreplied.  \xe2\x80\x9cI should be very sorry to admit that a robust and\r\nwell-disposed young man need ever despair.  If he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t succeed in one\r\nthing, he can try another.  Only, I should add, he should choose his line\r\nwith discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes, with discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d Morris Townsend repeated sympathetically.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have been indiscreet, formerly; but I think I have got over it.\r\nI am very steady now.\xe2\x80\x9d  And he stood a moment, looking down at his\r\nremarkably neat shoes.  Then at last, \xe2\x80\x9cWere you kindly intending to\r\npropose something for my advantage?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired, looking up and smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn his impudence!\xe2\x80\x9d the Doctor exclaimed privately.  But in a moment he\r\nreflected that he himself had, after all, touched first upon this\r\ndelicate point, and that his words might have been construed as an offer\r\nof assistance.  \xe2\x80\x9cI have no particular proposal to make,\xe2\x80\x9d he presently\r\nsaid; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it occurred to me to let you know that I have you in my mind.\r\nSometimes one hears of opportunities.  For instance\xe2\x80\x94should you object to\r\nleaving New York\xe2\x80\x94to going to a distance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to manage that.  I must seek my fortune\r\nhere or nowhere.  You see,\xe2\x80\x9d added Morris Townsend, \xe2\x80\x9cI have ties\xe2\x80\x94I have\r\nresponsibilities here.  I have a sister, a widow, from whom I have been\r\nseparated for a long time, and to whom I am almost everything.  I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to say to her that I must leave her.  She rather depends\r\nupon me, you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that\xe2\x80\x99s very proper; family feeling is very proper,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Sloper.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI often think there is not enough of it in our city.  I think I have\r\nheard of your sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is possible, but I rather doubt it; she lives so very quietly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs quietly, you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d the Doctor went on, with a short laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cas a\r\nlady may do who has several young children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my little nephews and nieces\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the very point!  I am helping to\r\nbring them up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris Townsend.  \xe2\x80\x9cI am a kind of amateur tutor; I\r\ngive them lessons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s very proper, as I say; but it is hardly a career.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t make my fortune!\xe2\x80\x9d the young man confessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not be too much bent on a fortune,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\nassure you I will keep you in mind; I won\xe2\x80\x99t lose sight of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf my situation becomes desperate I shall perhaps take the liberty of\r\nreminding you!\xe2\x80\x9d Morris rejoined, raising his voice a little, with a\r\nbrighter smile, as his interlocutor turned away.\r\n\r\nBefore he left the house the Doctor had a few words with Mrs. Almond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see his sister,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you call her?  Mrs.\r\nMontgomery.  I should like to have a little talk with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will try and manage it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Almond responded.  \xe2\x80\x9cI will take the\r\nfirst opportunity of inviting her, and you shall come and meet her.\r\nUnless, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Almond added, \xe2\x80\x9cshe first takes it into her head to\r\nbe sick and to send for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh no, not that; she must have trouble enough without that.  But it\r\nwould have its advantages, for then I should see the children.  I should\r\nlike very much to see the children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very thorough.  Do you want to catechise them about their\r\nuncle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely.  Their uncle tells me he has charge of their education, that\r\nhe saves their mother the expense of school-bills.  I should like to ask\r\nthem a few questions in the commoner branches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe certainly has not the cut of a schoolmaster!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Almond said to\r\nherself a short time afterwards, as she saw Morris Townsend in a corner\r\nbending over her niece, who was seated.\r\n\r\nAnd there was, indeed, nothing in the young man\xe2\x80\x99s discourse at this\r\nmoment that savoured of the pedagogue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you meet me somewhere to-morrow or next day?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a low\r\ntone, to Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeet you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, lifting her frightened eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have something particular to say to you\xe2\x80\x94very particular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you come to the house?  Can\xe2\x80\x99t you say it there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTownsend shook his head gloomily.  \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t enter your doors again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Townsend!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Catherine.  She trembled as she wondered\r\nwhat had happened, whether her father had forbidden it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t in self-respect,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man.  \xe2\x80\x9cYour father has insulted\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInsulted you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has taunted me with my poverty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you are mistaken\xe2\x80\x94you misunderstood him!\xe2\x80\x9d  Catherine spoke with\r\nenergy, getting up from her chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I am too proud\xe2\x80\x94too sensitive.  But would you have me otherwise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe asked tenderly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere my father is concerned, you must not be sure.  He is full of\r\ngoodness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe laughed at me for having no position!  I took it quietly; but only\r\nbecause he belongs to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he thinks.  I am sure\r\nhe means to be kind.  You must not be too proud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will be proud only of you,\xe2\x80\x9d Morris answered.  \xe2\x80\x9cWill you meet me in the\r\nSquare in the afternoon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA great blush on Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s part had been the answer to the declaration\r\nI have just quoted.  She turned away, heedless of his question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you meet me?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is very quiet there; no one need\r\nsee us\xe2\x80\x94toward dusk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is you who are unkind, it is you who laugh, when you say such things\r\nas that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear girl!\xe2\x80\x9d the young man murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know how little there is in me to be proud of.  I am ugly and\r\nstupid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris greeted this remark with an ardent murmur, in which she recognised\r\nnothing articulate but an assurance that she was his own dearest.\r\n\r\nBut she went on.  \xe2\x80\x9cI am not even\xe2\x80\x94I am not even\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d  And she paused a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not even brave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, then, if you are afraid, what shall we do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated a while; then at last\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou must come to the house,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid; \xe2\x80\x9cI am not afraid of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather it were in the Square,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man urged.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou know\r\nhow empty it is, often.  No one will see us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care who sees us!  But leave me now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe left her resignedly; he had got what he wanted.  Fortunately he was\r\nignorant that half an hour later, going home with her father and feeling\r\nhim near, the poor girl, in spite of her sudden declaration of courage,\r\nbegan to tremble again.  Her father said nothing; but she had an idea his\r\neyes were fixed upon her in the darkness.  Mrs. Penniman also was silent;\r\nMorris Townsend had told her that her niece preferred, unromantically, an\r\ninterview in a chintz-covered parlour to a sentimental tryst beside a\r\nfountain sheeted with dead leaves, and she was lost in wonderment at the\r\noddity\xe2\x80\x94almost the perversity\xe2\x80\x94of the choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nCATHERINE received the young man the next day on the ground she had\r\nchosen\xe2\x80\x94amid the chaste upholstery of a New York drawing-room furnished in\r\nthe fashion of fifty years ago.  Morris had swallowed his pride and made\r\nthe effort necessary to cross the threshold of her too derisive parent\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nact of magnanimity which could not fail to render him doubly interesting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must settle something\xe2\x80\x94we must take a line,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared, passing his\r\nhand through his hair and giving a glance at the long narrow mirror which\r\nadorned the space between the two windows, and which had at its base a\r\nlittle gilded bracket covered by a thin slab of white marble, supporting\r\nin its turn a backgammon board folded together in the shape of two\r\nvolumes, two shining folios inscribed in letters of greenish gilt,\r\n_History of England_.  If Morris had been pleased to describe the master\r\nof the house as a heartless scoffer, it is because he thought him too\r\nmuch on his guard, and this was the easiest way to express his own\r\ndissatisfaction\xe2\x80\x94a dissatisfaction which he had made a point of concealing\r\nfrom the Doctor.  It will probably seem to the reader, however, that the\r\nDoctor\xe2\x80\x99s vigilance was by no means excessive, and that these two young\r\npeople had an open field.  Their intimacy was now considerable, and it\r\nmay appear that for a shrinking and retiring person our heroine had been\r\nliberal of her favours.  The young man, within a few days, had made her\r\nlisten to things for which she had not supposed that she was prepared;\r\nhaving a lively foreboding of difficulties, he proceeded to gain as much\r\nground as possible in the present.  He remembered that fortune favours\r\nthe brave, and even if he had forgotten it, Mrs. Penniman would have\r\nremembered it for him.  Mrs. Penniman delighted of all things in a drama,\r\nand she flattered herself that a drama would now be enacted.  Combining\r\nas she did the zeal of the prompter with the impatience of the spectator,\r\nshe had long since done her utmost to pull up the curtain.  She too\r\nexpected to figure in the performance\xe2\x80\x94to be the confidante, the Chorus,\r\nto speak the epilogue.  It may even be said that there were times when\r\nshe lost sight altogether of the modest heroine of the play, in the\r\ncontemplation of certain great passages which would naturally occur\r\nbetween the hero and herself.\r\n\r\nWhat Morris had told Catherine at last was simply that he loved her, or\r\nrather adored her.  Virtually, he had made known as much already\xe2\x80\x94his\r\nvisits had been a series of eloquent intimations of it.  But now he had\r\naffirmed it in lover\xe2\x80\x99s vows, and, as a memorable sign of it, he had\r\npassed his arm round the girl\xe2\x80\x99s waist and taken a kiss.  This happy\r\ncertitude had come sooner than Catherine expected, and she had regarded\r\nit, very naturally, as a priceless treasure.  It may even be doubted\r\nwhether she had ever definitely expected to possess it; she had not been\r\nwaiting for it, and she had never said to herself that at a given moment\r\nit must come.  As I have tried to explain, she was not eager and\r\nexacting; she took what was given her from day to day; and if the\r\ndelightful custom of her lover\xe2\x80\x99s visits, which yielded her a happiness in\r\nwhich confidence and timidity were strangely blended, had suddenly come\r\nto an end, she would not only not have spoken of herself as one of the\r\nforsaken, but she would not have thought of herself as one of the\r\ndisappointed.  After Morris had kissed her, the last time he was with\r\nher, as a ripe assurance of his devotion, she begged him to go away, to\r\nleave her alone, to let her think.  Morris went away, taking another kiss\r\nfirst.  But Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s meditations had lacked a certain coherence.  She\r\nfelt his kisses on her lips and on her cheeks for a long time afterwards;\r\nthe sensation was rather an obstacle than an aid to reflexion.  She would\r\nhave liked to see her situation all clearly before her, to make up her\r\nmind what she should do if, as she feared, her father should tell her\r\nthat he disapproved of Morris Townsend.  But all that she could see with\r\nany vividness was that it was terribly strange that anyone should\r\ndisapprove of him; that there must in that case be some mistake, some\r\nmystery, which in a little while would be set at rest.  She put off\r\ndeciding and choosing; before the vision of a conflict with her father\r\nshe dropped her eyes and sat motionless, holding her breath and waiting.\r\nIt made her heart beat, it was intensely painful.  When Morris kissed her\r\nand said these things\xe2\x80\x94that also made her heart beat; but this was worse,\r\nand it frightened her.  Nevertheless, to-day, when the young man spoke of\r\nsettling something, taking a line, she felt that it was the truth, and\r\nshe answered very simply and without hesitating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must do our duty,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cwe must speak to my father.  I will do\r\nit to-night; you must do it to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very good of you to do it first,\xe2\x80\x9d Morris answered.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe young\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94the happy lover\xe2\x80\x94generally does that.  But just as you please!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt pleased Catherine to think that she should be brave for his sake, and\r\nin her satisfaction she even gave a little smile.  \xe2\x80\x9cWomen have more\r\ntact,\xe2\x80\x9d she said \xe2\x80\x9cthey ought to do it first.  They are more conciliating;\r\nthey can persuade better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will need all your powers of persuasion.  But, after all,\xe2\x80\x9d Morris\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are irresistible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t speak that way\xe2\x80\x94and promise me this.  To-morrow, when you\r\ntalk with father, you will be very gentle and respectful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs much so as possible,\xe2\x80\x9d Morris promised.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t be much use, but I\r\nshall try.  I certainly would rather have you easily than have to fight\r\nfor you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk about fighting; we shall not fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, we must be prepared,\xe2\x80\x9d Morris rejoined; \xe2\x80\x9cyou especially, because for\r\nyou it must come hardest.  Do you know the first thing your father will\r\nsay to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Morris; please tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will tell you I am mercenary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercenary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a big word; but it means a low thing.  It means that I am after\r\nyour money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Catherine softly.\r\n\r\nThe exclamation was so deprecating and touching that Morris indulged in\r\nanother little demonstration of affection.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut he will be sure to say\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be easy to be prepared for that,\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine said.  \xe2\x80\x9cI shall\r\nsimply say that he is mistaken\xe2\x80\x94that other men may be that way, but that\r\nyou are not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must make a great point of that, for it will be his own great\r\npoint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine looked at her lover a minute, and then she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall\r\npersuade him.  But I am glad we shall be rich,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\nMorris turned away, looking into the crown of his hat.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nmisfortune,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is from that our difficulty will\r\ncome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if it is the worst misfortune, we are not so unhappy.  Many people\r\nwould not think it so bad.  I will persuade him, and after that we shall\r\nbe very glad we have money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris Townsend listened to this robust logic in silence.  \xe2\x80\x9cI will leave\r\nmy defence to you; it\xe2\x80\x99s a charge that a man has to stoop to defend\r\nhimself from.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine on her side was silent for a while; she was looking at him\r\nwhile he looked, with a good deal of fixedness, out of the window.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMorris,\xe2\x80\x9d she said abruptly, \xe2\x80\x9care you very sure you love me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned round, and in a moment he was bending over her.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy own\r\ndearest, can you doubt it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have only known it five days,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut now it seems to me as if\r\nI could never do without it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will never be called upon to try!\xe2\x80\x9d  And he gave a little tender,\r\nreassuring laugh.  Then, in a moment, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is something you\r\nmust tell me, too.\xe2\x80\x9d  She had closed her eyes after the last word she\r\nuttered, and kept them closed; and at this she nodded her head, without\r\nopening them.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou must tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if your father is\r\ndead against me, if he absolutely forbids our marriage, you will still be\r\nfaithful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine opened her eyes, gazing at him, and she could give no better\r\npromise than what he read there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will cleave to me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou know you are your own\r\nmistress\xe2\x80\x94you are of age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Morris!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, for all answer.  Or rather not for all; for\r\nshe put her hand into his own.  He kept it a while, and presently he\r\nkissed her again.  This is all that need be recorded of their\r\nconversation; but Mrs. Penniman, if she had been present, would probably\r\nhave admitted that it was as well it had not taken place beside the\r\nfountain in Washington Square.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\nCATHERINE listened for her father when he came in that evening, and she\r\nheard him go to his study.  She sat quiet, though her heart was beating\r\nfast, for nearly half an hour; then she went and knocked at his door\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nceremony without which she never crossed the threshold of this apartment.\r\nOn entering it now she found him in his chair beside the fire,\r\nentertaining himself with a cigar and the evening paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have something to say to you,\xe2\x80\x9d she began very gently; and she sat down\r\nin the first place that offered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be very happy to hear it, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father.  He\r\nwaited\xe2\x80\x94waited, looking at her, while she stared, in a long silence, at\r\nthe fire.  He was curious and impatient, for he was sure she was going to\r\nspeak of Morris Townsend; but he let her take her own time, for he was\r\ndetermined to be very mild.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am engaged to be married!\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine announced at last, still staring\r\nat the fire.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor was startled; the accomplished fact was more than he had\r\nexpected.  But he betrayed no surprise.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou do right to tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsimply said.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd who is the happy mortal whom you have honoured with\r\nyour choice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Morris Townsend.\xe2\x80\x9d  And as she pronounced her lover\xe2\x80\x99s name, Catherine\r\nlooked at him.  What she saw was her father\xe2\x80\x99s still grey eye and his\r\nclear-cut, definite smile.  She contemplated these objects for a moment,\r\nand then she looked back at the fire; it was much warmer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen was this arrangement made?\xe2\x80\x9d the Doctor asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis afternoon\xe2\x80\x94two hours ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas Mr. Townsend here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, father; in the front parlour.\xe2\x80\x9d  She was very glad that she was not\r\nobliged to tell him that the ceremony of their betrothal had taken place\r\nout there under the bare ailantus-trees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it serious?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery serious, father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer father was silent a moment.  \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Townsend ought to have told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe means to tell you to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter I know all about it from you?  He ought to have told me before.\r\nDoes he think I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care\xe2\x80\x94because I left you so much liberty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine; \xe2\x80\x9che knew you would care.  And we have been so\r\nmuch obliged to you for\xe2\x80\x94for the liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor gave a short laugh.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou might have made a better use of it,\r\nCatherine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t say that, father,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl urged softly, fixing her dull\r\nand gentle eyes upon him.\r\n\r\nHe puffed his cigar awhile, meditatively.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou have gone very fast,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine answered simply; \xe2\x80\x9cI think we have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer father glanced at her an instant, removing his eyes from the fire.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder Mr. Townsend likes you.  You are so simple and so good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why it is\xe2\x80\x94but he _does_ like me.  I am sure of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you very fond of Mr. Townsend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like him very much, of course\xe2\x80\x94or I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t consent to marry him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have known him a very short time, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine, with some eagerness, \xe2\x80\x9cit doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take long to like\r\na person\xe2\x80\x94when once you begin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must have begun very quickly.  Was it the first time you saw\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94that night at your aunt\xe2\x80\x99s party?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, father,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl answered.  \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you about\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course; that\xe2\x80\x99s your own affair.  You will have observed that I have\r\nacted on that principle.  I have not interfered, I have left you your\r\nliberty, I have remembered that you are no longer a little girl\xe2\x80\x94that you\r\nhave arrived at years of discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel very old\xe2\x80\x94and very wise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine, smiling faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid that before long you will feel older and wiser yet.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike your engagement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine exclaimed softly, getting up from her chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my dear.  I am sorry to give you pain; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it.  You\r\nshould have consulted me before you settled it.  I have been too easy\r\nwith you, and I feel as if you had taken advantage of my indulgence.\r\nMost decidedly, you should have spoken to me first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine hesitated a moment, and then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIt was because I was afraid you\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like it!\xe2\x80\x9d she confessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there it is!  You had a bad conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have not a bad conscience, father!\xe2\x80\x9d the girl cried out, with\r\nconsiderable energy.  \xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t accuse me of anything so dreadful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThese words, in fact, represented to her imagination something very\r\nterrible indeed, something base and cruel, which she associated with\r\nmalefactors and prisoners.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt was because I was afraid\xe2\x80\x94afraid\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you were afraid, it was because you had been foolish!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid you didn\xe2\x80\x99t like Mr. Townsend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were quite right.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t like him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear father, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine, in a voice so timidly\r\nargumentative that it might have touched him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know him intimately.  But I know him enough.  I have\r\nmy impression of him.  You don\xe2\x80\x99t know him either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stood before the fire, with her hands lightly clasped in front of\r\nher; and her father, leaning back in his chair and looking up at her,\r\nmade this remark with a placidity that might have been irritating.\r\n\r\nI doubt, however, whether Catherine was irritated, though she broke into\r\na vehement protest.  \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know him?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I know\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94better than I have ever known any one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know a part of him\xe2\x80\x94what he has chosen to show you.  But you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rest?  What is the rest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever it may be.  There is sure to be plenty of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine, remembering how Morris had\r\nforewarned her.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that he is mercenary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer father looked up at her still, with his cold, quiet reasonable eye.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I meant it, my dear, I should say it!  But there is an error I wish\r\nparticularly to avoid\xe2\x80\x94that of rendering Mr. Townsend more interesting to\r\nyou by saying hard things about him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t think them hard if they are true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t, you will be a remarkably sensible young woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will be your reasons, at any rate, and you will want me to hear\r\nyour reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor smiled a little.  \xe2\x80\x9cVery true.  You have a perfect right to ask\r\nfor them.\xe2\x80\x9d  And he puffed his cigar a few moments.  \xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then,\r\nwithout accusing Mr. Townsend of being in love only with your fortune\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwith the fortune that you justly expect\xe2\x80\x94I will say that there is every\r\nreason to suppose that these good things have entered into his\r\ncalculation more largely than a tender solicitude for your happiness\r\nstrictly requires.  There is, of course, nothing impossible in an\r\nintelligent young man entertaining a disinterested affection for you.\r\nYou are an honest, amiable girl, and an intelligent young man might\r\neasily find it out.  But the principal thing that we know about this\r\nyoung man\xe2\x80\x94who is, indeed, very intelligent\xe2\x80\x94leads us to suppose that,\r\nhowever much he may value your personal merits, he values your money\r\nmore.  The principal thing we know about him is that he has led a life of\r\ndissipation, and has spent a fortune of his own in doing so.  That is\r\nenough for me, my dear.  I wish you to marry a young man with other\r\nantecedents\xe2\x80\x94a young man who could give positive guarantees.  If Morris\r\nTownsend has spent his own fortune in amusing himself, there is every\r\nreason to believe that he would spend yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor delivered himself of these remarks slowly, deliberately, with\r\noccasional pauses and prolongations of accent, which made no great\r\nallowance for poor Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s suspense as to his conclusion.  She sat\r\ndown at last, with her head bent and her eyes still fixed upon him; and\r\nstrangely enough\xe2\x80\x94I hardly know how to tell it\xe2\x80\x94even while she felt that\r\nwhat he said went so terribly against her, she admired his neatness and\r\nnobleness of expression.  There was something hopeless and oppressive in\r\nhaving to argue with her father; but she too, on her side, must try to be\r\nclear.  He was so quiet; he was not at all angry; and she too must be\r\nquiet.  But her very effort to be quiet made her tremble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not the principal thing we know about him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; and there\r\nwas a touch of her tremor in her voice.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere are other things\xe2\x80\x94many\r\nother things.  He has very high abilities\xe2\x80\x94he wants so much to do\r\nsomething.  He is kind, and generous, and true,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Catherine, who\r\nhad not suspected hitherto the resources of her eloquence.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd his\r\nfortune\xe2\x80\x94his fortune that he spent\xe2\x80\x94was very small!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the more reason he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have spent it,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Doctor,\r\ngetting up, with a laugh.  Then as Catherine, who had also risen to her\r\nfeet again, stood there in her rather angular earnestness, wishing so\r\nmuch and expressing so little, he drew her towards him and kissed her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t think me cruel?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, holding her a moment.\r\n\r\nThis question was not reassuring; it seemed to Catherine, on the\r\ncontrary, to suggest possibilities which made her feel sick.  But she\r\nanswered coherently enough\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNo, dear father; because if you knew how I\r\nfeel\xe2\x80\x94and you must know, you know everything\xe2\x80\x94you would be so kind, so\r\ngentle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think I know how you feel,\xe2\x80\x9d the Doctor said.  \xe2\x80\x9cI will be very\r\nkind\xe2\x80\x94be sure of that.  And I will see Mr. Townsend to-morrow.  Meanwhile,\r\nand for the present, be so good as to mention to no one that you are\r\nengaged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n\r\nON the morrow, in the afternoon, he stayed at home, awaiting Mr.\r\nTownsend\xe2\x80\x99s call\xe2\x80\x94a proceeding by which it appeared to him (justly perhaps,\r\nfor he was a very busy man) that he paid Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s suitor great honour,\r\nand gave both these young people so much the less to complain of.  Morris\r\npresented himself with a countenance sufficiently serene\xe2\x80\x94he appeared to\r\nhave forgotten the \xe2\x80\x9cinsult\xe2\x80\x9d for which he had solicited Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsympathy two evenings before, and Dr. Sloper lost no time in letting him\r\nknow that he had been prepared for his visit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatherine told me yesterday what has been going on between you,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou must allow me to say that it would have been becoming of you\r\nto give me notice of your intentions before they had gone so far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have done so,\xe2\x80\x9d Morris answered, \xe2\x80\x9cif you had not had so much the\r\nappearance of leaving your daughter at liberty.  She seems to me quite\r\nher own mistress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiterally, she is.  But she has not emancipated herself morally quite so\r\nfar, I trust, as to choose a husband without consulting me.  I have left\r\nher at liberty, but I have not been in the least indifferent.  The truth\r\nis that your little affair has come to a head with a rapidity that\r\nsurprises me.  It was only the other day that Catherine made your\r\nacquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not long ago, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris, with great gravity.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nadmit that we have not been slow to\xe2\x80\x94to arrive at an understanding.  But\r\nthat was very natural, from the moment we were sure of ourselves\xe2\x80\x94and of\r\neach other.  My interest in Miss Sloper began the first time I saw her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid it not by chance precede your first meeting?\xe2\x80\x9d the Doctor asked.\r\n\r\nMorris looked at him an instant.  \xe2\x80\x9cI certainly had already heard that she\r\nwas a charming girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA charming girl\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what you think her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly.  Otherwise I should not be sitting here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor meditated a moment.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear young man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou must be very susceptible.  As Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s father, I have, I trust, a\r\njust and tender appreciation of her many good qualities; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\ntelling you that I have never thought of her as a charming girl, and\r\nnever expected any one else to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris Townsend received this statement with a smile that was not wholly\r\ndevoid of deference.  \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I might think of her if I were\r\nher father.  I can\xe2\x80\x99t put myself in that place.  I speak from my own point\r\nof view.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor; \xe2\x80\x9cbut that is not all that is\r\nnecessary.  I told Catherine yesterday that I disapproved of her\r\nengagement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe let me know as much, and I was very sorry to hear it.  I am greatly\r\ndisappointed.\xe2\x80\x9d  And Morris sat in silence awhile, looking at the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you really expect I would say I was delighted, and throw my daughter\r\ninto your arms?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no; I had an idea you didn\xe2\x80\x99t like me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat gave you the idea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that I am poor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat has a harsh sound,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is about the\r\ntruth\xe2\x80\x94speaking of you strictly as a son-in-law.  Your absence of means,\r\nof a profession, of visible resources or prospects, places you in a\r\ncategory from which it would be imprudent for me to select a husband for\r\nmy daughter, who is a weak young woman with a large fortune.  In any\r\nother capacity I am perfectly prepared to like you.  As a son-in-law, I\r\nabominate you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris Townsend listened respectfully.  \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think Miss Sloper is a\r\nweak woman,\xe2\x80\x9d he presently said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you must defend her\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s the least you can do.  But I have\r\nknown my child twenty years, and you have known her six weeks.  Even if\r\nshe were not weak, however, you would still be a penniless man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes; that is _my_ weakness!  And therefore, you mean, I am\r\nmercenary\xe2\x80\x94I only want your daughter\xe2\x80\x99s money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say that.  I am not obliged to say it; and to say it, save under\r\nstress of compulsion, would be very bad taste.  I say simply that you\r\nbelong to the wrong category.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your daughter doesn\xe2\x80\x99t marry a category,\xe2\x80\x9d Townsend urged, with his\r\nhandsome smile.  \xe2\x80\x9cShe marries an individual\xe2\x80\x94an individual whom she is so\r\ngood as to say she loves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn individual who offers so little in return!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible to offer more than the most tender affection and a\r\nlifelong devotion?\xe2\x80\x9d the young man demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt depends how we take it.  It is possible to offer a few other things\r\nbesides; and not only is it possible, but it\xe2\x80\x99s usual.  A lifelong\r\ndevotion is measured after the fact; and meanwhile it is customary in\r\nthese cases to give a few material securities.  What are yours?  A very\r\nhandsome face and figure, and a very good manner.  They are excellent as\r\nfar as they go, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t go far enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one thing you should add to them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris; \xe2\x80\x9cthe word of a\r\ngentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe word of a gentleman that you will always love Catherine?  You must\r\nbe a very fine gentleman to be sure of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe word of a gentleman that I am not mercenary; that my affection for\r\nMiss Sloper is as pure and disinterested a sentiment as was ever lodged\r\nin a human breast!  I care no more for her fortune than for the ashes in\r\nthat grate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take note\xe2\x80\x94I take note,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut having done so, I turn\r\nto our category again.  Even with that solemn vow on your lips, you take\r\nyour place in it.  There is nothing against you but an accident, if you\r\nwill; but with my thirty years\xe2\x80\x99 medical practice, I have seen that\r\naccidents may have far-reaching consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris smoothed his hat\xe2\x80\x94it was already remarkably glossy\xe2\x80\x94and continued to\r\ndisplay a self-control which, as the Doctor was obliged to admit, was\r\nextremely creditable to him.  But his disappointment was evidently keen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there nothing I can do to make you believe in me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there were I should be sorry to suggest it, for\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to believe in you!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would go and dig in the fields.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be foolish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will take the first work that offers, to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo so by all means\xe2\x80\x94but for your own sake, not for mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see; you think I am an idler!\xe2\x80\x9d Morris exclaimed, a little too much in\r\nthe tone of a man who has made a discovery.  But he saw his error\r\nimmediately, and blushed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what I think, when once I have told you I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nof you as a son-in-law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Morris persisted.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou think I would squander her money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor smiled.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, as I say; but I plead guilty to\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s because I spent my own, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris.  \xe2\x80\x9cI frankly\r\nconfess that.  I have been wild.  I have been foolish.  I will tell you\r\nevery crazy thing I ever did, if you like.  There were some great follies\r\namong the number\xe2\x80\x94I have never concealed that.  But I have sown my wild\r\noats.  Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there some proverb about a reformed rake?  I was not a rake,\r\nbut I assure you I have reformed.  It is better to have amused oneself\r\nfor a while and have done with it.  Your daughter would never care for a\r\nmilksop; and I will take the liberty of saying that you would like one\r\nquite as little.  Besides, between my money and hers there is a great\r\ndifference.  I spent my own; it was because it was my own that I spent\r\nit.  And I made no debts; when it was gone I stopped.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t owe a\r\npenny in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to inquire what you are living on now\xe2\x80\x94though I admit,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nDoctor added, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the question, on my part, is inconsistent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am living on the remnants of my property,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris Townsend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you!\xe2\x80\x9d the Doctor gravely replied.\r\n\r\nYes, certainly, Morris\xe2\x80\x99s self-control was laudable.  \xe2\x80\x9cEven admitting I\r\nattach an undue importance to Miss Sloper\xe2\x80\x99s fortune,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwould\r\nnot that be in itself an assurance that I should take much care of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you should take too much care would be quite as bad as that you\r\nshould take too little.  Catherine might suffer as much by your economy\r\nas by your extravagance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you are very unjust!\xe2\x80\x9d  The young man made this declaration\r\ndecently, civilly, without violence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is your privilege to think so, and I surrender my reputation to you!\r\nI certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t flatter myself I gratify you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you care a little to gratify your daughter?  Do you enjoy the idea\r\nof making her miserable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am perfectly resigned to her thinking me a tyrant for a twelvemonth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a twelvemonth!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Morris, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a lifetime, then!  She may as well be miserable in that way as in\r\nthe other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere at last Morris lost his temper.  \xe2\x80\x9cAh, you are not polite, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou push me to it\xe2\x80\x94you argue too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a great deal at stake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, whatever it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have lost it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure of that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Morris; \xe2\x80\x9care you sure your daughter will\r\ngive me up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, of course, you have lost it as far as I am concerned.  As for\r\nCatherine\xe2\x80\x99s giving you up\xe2\x80\x94no, I am not sure of it.  But as I shall\r\nstrongly recommend it, as I have a great fund of respect and affection in\r\nmy daughter\xe2\x80\x99s mind to draw upon, and as she has the sentiment of duty\r\ndeveloped in a very high degree, I think it extremely possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris Townsend began to smooth his hat again.  \xe2\x80\x9cI too have a fund of\r\naffection to draw upon!\xe2\x80\x9d he observed at last.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor at this point showed his own first symptoms of irritation.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to defy me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall it what you please, sir!  I mean not to give your daughter up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor shook his head.  \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t the least fear of your pining away\r\nyour life.  You are made to enjoy it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris gave a laugh.  \xe2\x80\x9cYour opposition to my marriage is all the more\r\ncruel, then!  Do you intend to forbid your daughter to see me again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is past the age at which people are forbidden, and I am not a father\r\nin an old-fashioned novel.  But I shall strongly urge her to break with\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think she will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris Townsend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not.  But I shall have done what I could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has gone too far,\xe2\x80\x9d Morris went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo retreat?  Then let her stop where she is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo far to stop, I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor looked at him a moment; Morris had his hand on the door.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a great deal of impertinence in your saying it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will say no more, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d Morris answered; and, making his bow, he left\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIT may be thought the Doctor was too positive, and Mrs. Almond intimated\r\nas much.  But, as he said, he had his impression; it seemed to him\r\nsufficient, and he had no wish to modify it.  He had passed his life in\r\nestimating people (it was part of the medical trade), and in nineteen\r\ncases out of twenty he was right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps Mr. Townsend is the twentieth case,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Almond suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he is, though he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look to me at all like a twentieth\r\ncase.  But I will give him the benefit of the doubt, and, to make sure, I\r\nwill go and talk with Mrs. Montgomery.  She will almost certainly tell me\r\nI have done right; but it is just possible that she will prove to me that\r\nI have made the greatest mistake of my life.  If she does, I will beg Mr.\r\nTownsend\xe2\x80\x99s pardon.  You needn\xe2\x80\x99t invite her to meet me, as you kindly\r\nproposed; I will write her a frank letter, telling her how matters stand,\r\nand asking leave to come and see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid the frankness will be chiefly on your side.  The poor little\r\nwoman will stand up for her brother, whatever he may be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever he may be?  I doubt that.  People are not always so fond of\r\ntheir brothers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Almond, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it\xe2\x80\x99s a question of thirty thousand a year\r\ncoming into a family\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she stands up for him on account of the money, she will be a humbug.\r\nIf she is a humbug I shall see it.  If I see it, I won\xe2\x80\x99t waste time with\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is not a humbug\xe2\x80\x94she is an exemplary woman.  She will not wish to\r\nplay her brother a trick simply because he is selfish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she is worth talking to, she will sooner play him a trick than that\r\nhe should play Catherine one.  Has she seen Catherine, by the way\xe2\x80\x94does\r\nshe know her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to my knowledge.  Mr. Townsend can have had no particular interest\r\nin bringing them together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she is an exemplary woman, no.  But we shall see to what extent she\r\nanswers your description.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be curious to hear her description of you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Almond,\r\nwith a laugh.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, meanwhile, how is Catherine taking it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs she takes everything\xe2\x80\x94as a matter of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t she make a noise?  Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t she made a scene?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is not scenic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought a love-lorn maiden was always scenic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fantastic widow is more so.  Lavinia has made me a speech; she thinks\r\nme very arbitrary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has a talent for being in the wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Almond.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am\r\nvery sorry for Catherine, all the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I.  But she will get over it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou believe she will give him up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI count upon it.  She has such an admiration for her father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we know all about that!  But it only makes me pity her the more.  It\r\nmakes her dilemma the more painful, and the effort of choosing between\r\nyou and her lover almost impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she can\xe2\x80\x99t choose, all the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but he will stand there entreating her to choose, and Lavinia will\r\npull on that side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad she is not on my side; she is capable of ruining an excellent\r\ncause.  The day Lavinia gets into your boat it capsizes.  But she had\r\nbetter be careful,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor.  \xe2\x80\x9cI will have no treason in my\r\nhouse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suspect she will be careful; for she is at bottom very much afraid of\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are both afraid of me\xe2\x80\x94harmless as I am!\xe2\x80\x9d the Doctor answered.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nit is on that that I build\xe2\x80\x94on the salutary terror I inspire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nHE wrote his frank letter to Mrs. Montgomery, who punctually answered it,\r\nmentioning an hour at which he might present himself in the Second\r\nAvenue.  She lived in a neat little house of red brick, which had been\r\nfreshly painted, with the edges of the bricks very sharply marked out in\r\nwhite.  It has now disappeared, with its companions, to make room for a\r\nrow of structures more majestic.  There were green shutters upon the\r\nwindows, without slats, but pierced with little holes, arranged in\r\ngroups; and before the house was a diminutive yard, ornamented with a\r\nbush of mysterious character, and surrounded by a low wooden paling,\r\npainted in the same green as the shutters.  The place looked like a\r\nmagnified baby-house, and might have been taken down from a shelf in a\r\ntoy-shop.  Dr. Sloper, when he went to call, said to himself, as he\r\nglanced at the objects I have enumerated, that Mrs. Montgomery was\r\nevidently a thrifty and self-respecting little person\xe2\x80\x94the modest\r\nproportions of her dwelling seemed to indicate that she was of small\r\nstature\xe2\x80\x94who took a virtuous satisfaction in keeping herself tidy, and had\r\nresolved that, since she might not be splendid, she would at least be\r\nimmaculate.  She received him in a little parlour, which was precisely\r\nthe parlour he had expected: a small unspeckled bower, ornamented with a\r\ndesultory foliage of tissue-paper, and with clusters of glass drops, amid\r\nwhich\xe2\x80\x94to carry out the analogy\xe2\x80\x94the temperature of the leafy season was\r\nmaintained by means of a cast-iron stove, emitting a dry blue flame, and\r\nsmelling strongly of varnish.  The walls were embellished with engravings\r\nswathed in pink gauze, and the tables ornamented with volumes of extracts\r\nfrom the poets, usually bound in black cloth stamped with florid designs\r\nin jaundiced gilt.  The Doctor had time to take cognisance of these\r\ndetails, for Mrs. Montgomery, whose conduct he pronounced under the\r\ncircumstances inexcusable, kept him waiting some ten minutes before she\r\nappeared.  At last, however, she rustled in, smoothing down a stiff\r\npoplin dress, with a little frightened flush in a gracefully-rounded\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\nShe was a small, plump, fair woman, with a bright, clear eye, and an\r\nextraordinary air of neatness and briskness.  But these qualities were\r\nevidently combined with an unaffected humility, and the Doctor gave her\r\nhis esteem as soon as he had looked at her.  A brave little person, with\r\nlively perceptions, and yet a disbelief in her own talent for social, as\r\ndistinguished from practical, affairs\xe2\x80\x94this was his rapid mental _r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9_\r\nof Mrs. Montgomery, who, as he saw, was flattered by what she regarded as\r\nthe honour of his visit.  Mrs. Montgomery, in her little red house in the\r\nSecond Avenue, was a person for whom Dr. Sloper was one of the great men,\r\none of the fine gentlemen of New York; and while she fixed her agitated\r\neyes upon him, while she clasped her mittened hands together in her\r\nglossy poplin lap, she had the appearance of saying to herself that he\r\nquite answered her idea of what a distinguished guest would naturally be.\r\nShe apologised for being late; but he interrupted her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cfor while I sat here I had time to think\r\nover what I wish to say to you, and to make up my mind how to begin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do begin!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mrs. Montgomery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not so easy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, smiling.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou will have gathered\r\nfrom my letter that I wish to ask you a few questions, and you may not\r\nfind it very comfortable to answer them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I have thought what I should say.  It is not very easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must understand my situation\xe2\x80\x94my state of mind.  Your brother\r\nwishes to marry my daughter, and I wish to find out what sort of a young\r\nman he is.  A good way to do so seemed to be to come and ask you; which I\r\nhave proceeded to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Montgomery evidently took the situation very seriously; she was in a\r\nstate of extreme moral concentration.  She kept her pretty eyes, which\r\nwere illumined by a sort of brilliant modesty, attached to his own\r\ncountenance, and evidently paid the most earnest attention to each of his\r\nwords.  Her expression indicated that she thought his idea of coming to\r\nsee her a very superior conception, but that she was really afraid to\r\nhave opinions on strange subjects.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am extremely glad to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a tone which seemed to\r\nadmit, at the same time, that this had nothing to do with the question.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor took advantage of this admission.  \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t come to see you\r\nfor your pleasure; I came to make you say disagreeable things\xe2\x80\x94and you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t like that.  What sort of a gentleman is your brother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Montgomery\xe2\x80\x99s illuminated gaze grew vague, and began to wander.  She\r\nsmiled a little, and for some time made no answer, so that the Doctor at\r\nlast became impatient.  And her answer, when it came, was not\r\nsatisfactory.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is difficult to talk about one\xe2\x80\x99s brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot when one is fond of him, and when one has plenty of good to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, even then, when a good deal depends on it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Montgomery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing depends on it, for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean for\xe2\x80\x94for\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and she hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor your brother himself.  I see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean for Miss Sloper,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Montgomery.  The Doctor liked this;\r\nit had the accent of sincerity.  \xe2\x80\x9cExactly; that\xe2\x80\x99s the point.  If my poor\r\ngirl should marry your brother, everything\xe2\x80\x94as regards her happiness\xe2\x80\x94would\r\ndepend on his being a good fellow.  She is the best creature in the\r\nworld, and she could never do him a grain of injury.  He, on the other\r\nhand, if he should not be all that we desire, might make her very\r\nmiserable.  That is why I want you to throw some light upon his\r\ncharacter, you know.  Of course you are not bound to do it.  My daughter,\r\nwhom you have never seen, is nothing to you; and I, possibly, am only an\r\nindiscreet and impertinent old man.  It is perfectly open to you to tell\r\nme that my visit is in very bad taste and that I had better go about my\r\nbusiness.  But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you will do this; because I think we shall\r\ninterest you, my poor girl and I.  I am sure that if you were to see\r\nCatherine, she would interest you very much.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean because she is\r\ninteresting in the usual sense of the word, but because you would feel\r\nsorry for her.  She is so soft, so simple-minded, she would be such an\r\neasy victim!  A bad husband would have remarkable facilities for making\r\nher miserable; for she would have neither the intelligence nor the\r\nresolution to get the better of him, and yet she would have an\r\nexaggerated power of suffering.  I see,\xe2\x80\x9d added the Doctor, with his most\r\ninsinuating, his most professional laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are already interested!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been interested from the moment he told me he was engaged,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Montgomery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! he says that\xe2\x80\x94he calls it an engagement?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he has told me you didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he tell you that I don\xe2\x80\x99t like _him_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he told me that too.  I said I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it!\xe2\x80\x9d added Mrs.\r\nMontgomery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you can\xe2\x80\x99t.  But what you can do is to tell me I am right\xe2\x80\x94to\r\ngive me an attestation, as it were.\xe2\x80\x9d  And the Doctor accompanied this\r\nremark with another professional smile.\r\n\r\nMrs. Montgomery, however, smiled not at all; it was obvious that she\r\ncould not take the humorous view of his appeal.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat is a good deal to\r\nask,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere can be no doubt of that; and I must, in conscience, remind you of\r\nthe advantages a young man marrying my daughter would enjoy.  She has an\r\nincome of ten thousand dollars in her own right, left her by her mother;\r\nif she marries a husband I approve, she will come into almost twice as\r\nmuch more at my death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Montgomery listened in great earnestness to this splendid financial\r\nstatement; she had never heard thousands of dollars so familiarly talked\r\nabout.  She flushed a little with excitement.  \xe2\x80\x9cYour daughter will be\r\nimmensely rich,\xe2\x80\x9d she said softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the bother of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if Morris should marry her, he\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d  And she hesitated timidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would be master of all that money?  By no means.  He would be master\r\nof the ten thousand a year that she has from her mother; but I should\r\nleave every penny of my own fortune, earned in the laborious exercise of\r\nmy profession, to public institutions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Montgomery dropped her eyes at this, and sat for some time gazing at\r\nthe straw matting which covered her floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it seems to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cthat in so doing\r\nI should play your brother a very shabby trick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all.  That is too much money to get possession of so easily, by\r\nmarrying.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would be right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s right to get all one can.  But in this case your brother wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe able.  If Catherine marries without my consent, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get a\r\npenny from my own pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that certain?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Montgomery, looking up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs certain as that I sit here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven if she should pine away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven if she should pine to a shadow, which isn\xe2\x80\x99t probable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes Morris know this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be most happy to inform him!\xe2\x80\x9d the Doctor exclaimed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Montgomery resumed her meditations, and her visitor, who was\r\nprepared to give time to the affair, asked himself whether, in spite of\r\nher little conscientious air, she was not playing into her brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands.  At the same time he was half ashamed of the ordeal to which he\r\nhad subjected her, and was touched by the gentleness with which she bore\r\nit.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf she were a humbug,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cshe would get angry; unless she be\r\nvery deep indeed.  It is not probable that she is as deep as that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you dislike Morris so much?\xe2\x80\x9d she presently asked, emerging\r\nfrom her reflexions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t dislike him in the least as a friend, as a companion.  He seems\r\nto me a charming fellow, and I should think he would be excellent\r\ncompany.  I dislike him, exclusively, as a son-in-law.  If the only\r\noffice of a son-in-law were to dine at the paternal table, I should set a\r\nhigh value upon your brother.  He dines capitally.  But that is a small\r\npart of his function, which, in general, is to be a protector and\r\ncaretaker of my child, who is singularly ill-adapted to take care of\r\nherself.  It is there that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t satisfy me.  I confess I have\r\nnothing but my impression to go by; but I am in the habit of trusting my\r\nimpression.  Of course you are at liberty to contradict it flat.  He\r\nstrikes me as selfish and shallow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Montgomery\xe2\x80\x99s eyes expanded a little, and the Doctor fancied he saw\r\nthe light of admiration in them.  \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder you have discovered he is\r\nselfish!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think he hides it so well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Montgomery.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I think we are all rather\r\nselfish,\xe2\x80\x9d she added quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so too; but I have seen people hide it better than he.  You see\r\nI am helped by a habit I have of dividing people into classes, into\r\ntypes.  I may easily be mistaken about your brother as an individual, but\r\nhis type is written on his whole person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is very good-looking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Montgomery.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor eyed her a moment.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou women are all the same!  But the type\r\nto which your brother belongs was made to be the ruin of you, and you\r\nwere made to be its handmaids and victims.  The sign of the type in\r\nquestion is the determination\xe2\x80\x94sometimes terrible in its quiet\r\nintensity\xe2\x80\x94to accept nothing of life but its pleasures, and to secure\r\nthese pleasures chiefly by the aid of your complaisant sex.  Young men of\r\nthis class never do anything for themselves that they can get other\r\npeople to do for them, and it is the infatuation, the devotion, the\r\nsuperstition of others that keeps them going.  These others in\r\nninety-nine cases out of a hundred are women.  What our young friends\r\nchiefly insist upon is that some one else shall suffer for them; and\r\nwomen do that sort of thing, as you must know, wonderfully well.\xe2\x80\x9d  The\r\nDoctor paused a moment, and then he added abruptly, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have suffered\r\nimmensely for your brother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis exclamation was abrupt, as I say, but it was also perfectly\r\ncalculated.  The Doctor had been rather disappointed at not finding his\r\ncompact and comfortable little hostess surrounded in a more visible\r\ndegree by the ravages of Morris Townsend\xe2\x80\x99s immorality; but he had said to\r\nhimself that this was not because the young man had spared her, but\r\nbecause she had contrived to plaster up her wounds.  They were aching\r\nthere, behind the varnished stove, the festooned engravings, beneath her\r\nown neat little poplin bosom; and if he could only touch the tender spot,\r\nshe would make a movement that would betray her.  The words I have just\r\nquoted were an attempt to put his finger suddenly upon the place; and\r\nthey had some of the success that he looked for.  The tears sprang for a\r\nmoment to Mrs. Montgomery\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and she indulged in a proud little jerk\r\nof the head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you have found that out!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy a philosophic trick\xe2\x80\x94by what they call induction.  You know you have\r\nalways your option of contradicting me.  But kindly answer me a question.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you give your brother money?  I think you ought to answer that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have given him money,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Montgomery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have not had much to give him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was silent a moment.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf you ask me for a confession of poverty,\r\nthat is easily made.  I am very poor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne would never suppose it from your\xe2\x80\x94your charming house,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nDoctor.  \xe2\x80\x9cI learned from my sister that your income was moderate, and\r\nyour family numerous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have five children,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Montgomery observed; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am happy to say\r\nI can bring them up decently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you can\xe2\x80\x94accomplished and devoted as you are!  But your brother\r\nhas counted them over, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCounted them over?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knows there are five, I mean.  He tells me it is he that brings them\r\nup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Montgomery stared a moment, and then quickly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes; he teaches\r\nthem Spanish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor laughed out.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat must take a great deal off your hands!\r\nYour brother also knows, of course, that you have very little money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have often told him so!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Montgomery exclaimed, more unreservedly\r\nthan she had yet spoken.  She was apparently taking some comfort in the\r\nDoctor\xe2\x80\x99s clairvoyancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich means that you have often occasion to, and that he often sponges\r\non you.  Excuse the crudity of my language; I simply express a fact.  I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t ask you how much of your money he has had, it is none of my\r\nbusiness.  I have ascertained what I suspected\xe2\x80\x94what I wished.\xe2\x80\x9d  And the\r\nDoctor got up, gently smoothing his hat.  \xe2\x80\x9cYour brother lives on you,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid as he stood there.\r\n\r\nMrs. Montgomery quickly rose from her chair, following her visitor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmovements with a look of fascination.  But then, with a certain\r\ninconsequence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI have never complained of him!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t protest\xe2\x80\x94you have not betrayed him.  But I advise you not to\r\ngive him any more money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see it is in my interest that he should marry a rich person?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe asked.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf, as you say, he lives on me, I can only wish to get rid\r\nof him, and to put obstacles in the way of his marrying is to increase my\r\nown difficulties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish very much you would come to me with your difficulties,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nDoctor.  \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, if I throw him back on your hands, the least I can\r\ndo is to help you to bear the burden.  If you will allow me to say so,\r\nthen, I shall take the liberty of placing in your hands, for the present,\r\na certain fund for your brother\xe2\x80\x99s support.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Montgomery stared; she evidently thought he was jesting; but she\r\npresently saw that he was not, and the complication of her feelings\r\nbecame painful.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me that I ought to be very much offended\r\nwith you,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I have offered you money?  That\xe2\x80\x99s a superstition,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nDoctor.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou must let me come and see you again, and we will talk about\r\nthese things.  I suppose that some of your children are girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have two little girls,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Montgomery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, when they grow up, and begin to think of taking husbands, you will\r\nsee how anxious you will be about the moral character of these gentlemen.\r\nThen you will understand this visit of mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you are not to believe that Morris\xe2\x80\x99s moral character is bad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor looked at her a little, with folded arms.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere is something\r\nI should greatly like\xe2\x80\x94as a moral satisfaction.  I should like to hear you\r\nsay\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98He is abominably selfish!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words came out with the grave distinctness of his voice, and they\r\nseemed for an instant to create, to poor Mrs. Montgomery\xe2\x80\x99s troubled\r\nvision, a material image.  She gazed at it an instant, and then she\r\nturned away.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou distress me, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe is, after all,\r\nmy brother, and his talents, his talents\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d  On these last words her voice\r\nquavered, and before he knew it she had burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis talents are first-rate!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe must find a proper\r\nfield for them!\xe2\x80\x9d  And he assured her most respectfully of his regret at\r\nhaving so greatly discomposed her.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all for my poor Catherine,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwent on.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou must know her, and you will see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Montgomery brushed away her tears, and blushed at having shed them.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to know your daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered; and then, in an\r\ninstant\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let her marry him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr. Sloper went away with the words gently humming in his ears\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nher marry him!\xe2\x80\x9d  They gave him the moral satisfaction of which he had\r\njust spoken, and their value was the greater that they had evidently cost\r\na pang to poor little Mrs. Montgomery\xe2\x80\x99s family pride.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\n\r\nHE had been puzzled by the way that Catherine carried herself; her\r\nattitude at this sentimental crisis seemed to him unnaturally passive.\r\nShe had not spoken to him again after that scene in the library, the day\r\nbefore his interview with Morris; and a week had elapsed without making\r\nany change in her manner.  There was nothing in it that appealed for\r\npity, and he was even a little disappointed at her not giving him an\r\nopportunity to make up for his harshness by some manifestation of\r\nliberality which should operate as a compensation.  He thought a little\r\nof offering to take her for a tour in Europe; but he was determined to do\r\nthis only in case she should seem mutely to reproach him.  He had an idea\r\nthat she would display a talent for mute reproaches, and he was surprised\r\nat not finding himself exposed to these silent batteries.  She said\r\nnothing, either tacitly or explicitly, and as she was never very\r\ntalkative, there was now no especial eloquence in her reserve.  And poor\r\nCatherine was not sulky\xe2\x80\x94a style of behaviour for which she had too little\r\nhistrionic talent; she was simply very patient.  Of course she was\r\nthinking over her situation, and she was apparently doing so in a\r\ndeliberate and unimpassioned manner, with a view of making the best of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will do as I have bidden her,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, and he made the\r\nfurther reflexion that his daughter was not a woman of a great spirit.  I\r\nknow not whether he had hoped for a little more resistance for the sake\r\nof a little more entertainment; but he said to himself, as he had said\r\nbefore, that though it might have its momentary alarms, paternity was,\r\nafter all, not an exciting vocation.\r\n\r\nCatherine, meanwhile, had made a discovery of a very different sort; it\r\nhad become vivid to her that there was a great excitement in trying to be\r\na good daughter.  She had an entirely new feeling, which may be described\r\nas a state of expectant suspense about her own actions.  She watched\r\nherself as she would have watched another person, and wondered what she\r\nwould do.  It was as if this other person, who was both herself and not\r\nherself, had suddenly sprung into being, inspiring her with a natural\r\ncuriosity as to the performance of untested functions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad I have such a good daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father, kissing her,\r\nafter the lapse of several days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am trying to be good,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, turning away, with a conscience\r\nnot altogether clear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there is anything you would like to say to me, you know you must not\r\nhesitate.  You needn\xe2\x80\x99t feel obliged to be so quiet.  I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\nthat Mr. Townsend should be a frequent topic of conversation, but\r\nwhenever you have anything particular to say about him I shall be very\r\nglad to hear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine; \xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing particular at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe never asked her whether she had seen Morris again, because he was sure\r\nthat if this had been the case she would tell him.  She had, in fact, not\r\nseen him, she had only written him a long letter.  The letter at least\r\nwas long for her; and, it may be added, that it was long for Morris; it\r\nconsisted of five pages, in a remarkably neat and handsome hand.\r\nCatherine\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting was beautiful, and she was even a little proud of\r\nit; she was extremely fond of copying, and possessed volumes of extracts\r\nwhich testified to this accomplishment; volumes which she had exhibited\r\none day to her lover, when the bliss of feeling that she was important in\r\nhis eyes was exceptionally keen.  She told Morris in writing that her\r\nfather had expressed the wish that she should not see him again, and that\r\nshe begged he would not come to the house until she should have \xe2\x80\x9cmade up\r\nher mind.\xe2\x80\x9d  Morris replied with a passionate epistle, in which he asked\r\nto what, in Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name, she wished to make up her mind.  Had not her\r\nmind been made up two weeks before, and could it be possible that she\r\nentertained the idea of throwing him off?  Did she mean to break down at\r\nthe very beginning of their ordeal, after all the promises of fidelity\r\nshe had both given and extracted?  And he gave an account of his own\r\ninterview with her father\xe2\x80\x94an account not identical at all points with\r\nthat offered in these pages.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe was terribly violent,\xe2\x80\x9d Morris wrote;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut you know my self-control.  I have need of it all when I remember\r\nthat I have it in my power to break in upon your cruel captivity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nCatherine sent him, in answer to this, a note of three lines.  \xe2\x80\x9cI am in\r\ngreat trouble; do not doubt of my affection, but let me wait a little and\r\nthink.\xe2\x80\x9d  The idea of a struggle with her father, of setting up her will\r\nagainst his own, was heavy on her soul, and it kept her formally\r\nsubmissive, as a great physical weight keeps us motionless.  It never\r\nentered into her mind to throw her lover off; but from the first she\r\ntried to assure herself that there would be a peaceful way out of their\r\ndifficulty.  The assurance was vague, for it contained no element of\r\npositive conviction that her father would change his mind.  She only had\r\nan idea that if she should be very good, the situation would in some\r\nmysterious manner improve.  To be good, she must be patient, respectful,\r\nabstain from judging her father too harshly, and from committing any act\r\nof open defiance.  He was perhaps right, after all, to think as he did;\r\nby which Catherine meant not in the least that his judgement of Morris\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmotives in seeking to marry her was perhaps a just one, but that it was\r\nprobably natural and proper that conscientious parents should be\r\nsuspicious and even unjust.  There were probably people in the world as\r\nbad as her father supposed Morris to be, and if there were the slightest\r\nchance of Morris being one of these sinister persons, the Doctor was\r\nright in taking it into account.  Of course he could not know what she\r\nknew, how the purest love and truth were seated in the young man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes;\r\nbut Heaven, in its time, might appoint a way of bringing him to such\r\nknowledge.  Catherine expected a good deal of Heaven, and referred to the\r\nskies the initiative, as the French say, in dealing with her dilemma.\r\nShe could not imagine herself imparting any kind of knowledge to her\r\nfather, there was something superior even in his injustice and absolute\r\nin his mistakes.  But she could at least be good, and if she were only\r\ngood enough, Heaven would invent some way of reconciling all things\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ndignity of her father\xe2\x80\x99s errors and the sweetness of her own confidence,\r\nthe strict performance of her filial duties and the enjoyment of Morris\r\nTownsend\xe2\x80\x99s affection.  Poor Catherine would have been glad to regard Mrs.\r\nPenniman as an illuminating agent, a part which this lady herself indeed\r\nwas but imperfectly prepared to play.  Mrs. Penniman took too much\r\nsatisfaction in the sentimental shadows of this little drama to have, for\r\nthe moment, any great interest in dissipating them.  She wished the plot\r\nto thicken, and the advice that she gave her niece tended, in her own\r\nimagination, to produce this result.  It was rather incoherent counsel,\r\nand from one day to another it contradicted itself; but it was pervaded\r\nby an earnest desire that Catherine should do something striking.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmust _act_, my dear; in your situation the great thing is to act,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Penniman, who found her niece altogether beneath her opportunities.\r\nMrs. Penniman\xe2\x80\x99s real hope was that the girl would make a secret marriage,\r\nat which she should officiate as brideswoman or duenna.  She had a vision\r\nof this ceremony being performed in some subterranean chapel\xe2\x80\x94subterranean\r\nchapels in New York were not frequent, but Mrs. Penniman\xe2\x80\x99s imagination\r\nwas not chilled by trifles\xe2\x80\x94and of the guilty couple\xe2\x80\x94she liked to think of\r\npoor Catherine and her suitor as the guilty couple\xe2\x80\x94being shuffled away in\r\na fast-whirling vehicle to some obscure lodging in the suburbs, where she\r\nwould pay them (in a thick veil) clandestine visits, where they would\r\nendure a period of romantic privation, and where ultimately, after she\r\nshould have been their earthly providence, their intercessor, their\r\nadvocate, and their medium of communication with the world, they should\r\nbe reconciled to her brother in an artistic tableau, in which she herself\r\nshould be somehow the central figure.  She hesitated as yet to recommend\r\nthis course to Catherine, but she attempted to draw an attractive picture\r\nof it to Morris Townsend.  She was in daily communication with the young\r\nman, whom she kept informed by letters of the state of affairs in\r\nWashington Square.  As he had been banished, as she said, from the house,\r\nshe no longer saw him; but she ended by writing to him that she longed\r\nfor an interview.  This interview could take place only on neutral\r\nground, and she bethought herself greatly before selecting a place of\r\nmeeting.  She had an inclination for Greenwood Cemetery, but she gave it\r\nup as too distant; she could not absent herself for so long, as she said,\r\nwithout exciting suspicion.  Then she thought of the Battery, but that\r\nwas rather cold and windy, besides one\xe2\x80\x99s being exposed to intrusion from\r\nthe Irish emigrants who at this point alight, with large appetites, in\r\nthe New World and at last she fixed upon an oyster saloon in the Seventh\r\nAvenue, kept by a negro\xe2\x80\x94an establishment of which she knew nothing save\r\nthat she had noticed it in passing.  She made an appointment with Morris\r\nTownsend to meet him there, and she went to the tryst at dusk, enveloped\r\nin an impenetrable veil.  He kept her waiting for half an hour\xe2\x80\x94he had\r\nalmost the whole width of the city to traverse\xe2\x80\x94but she liked to wait, it\r\nseemed to intensify the situation.  She ordered a cup of tea, which\r\nproved excessively bad, and this gave her a sense that she was suffering\r\nin a romantic cause.  When Morris at last arrived, they sat together for\r\nhalf an hour in the duskiest corner of a back shop; and it is hardly too\r\nmuch to say that this was the happiest half-hour that Mrs. Penniman had\r\nknown for years.  The situation was really thrilling, and it scarcely\r\nseemed to her a false note when her companion asked for an oyster stew,\r\nand proceeded to consume it before her eyes.  Morris, indeed, needed all\r\nthe satisfaction that stewed oysters could give him, for it may be\r\nintimated to the reader that he regarded Mrs. Penniman in the light of a\r\nfifth wheel to his coach.  He was in a state of irritation natural to a\r\ngentleman of fine parts who had been snubbed in a benevolent attempt to\r\nconfer a distinction upon a young woman of inferior characteristics, and\r\nthe insinuating sympathy of this somewhat desiccated matron appeared to\r\noffer him no practical relief.  He thought her a humbug, and he judged of\r\nhumbugs with a good deal of confidence.  He had listened and made himself\r\nagreeable to her at first, in order to get a footing in Washington\r\nSquare; and at present he needed all his self-command to be decently\r\ncivil.  It would have gratified him to tell her that she was a fantastic\r\nold woman, and that he should like to put her into an omnibus and send\r\nher home.  We know, however, that Morris possessed the virtue of\r\nself-control, and he had, moreover, the constant habit of seeking to be\r\nagreeable; so that, although Mrs. Penniman\xe2\x80\x99s demeanour only exasperated\r\nhis already unquiet nerves, he listened to her with a sombre deference in\r\nwhich she found much to admire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEY had of course immediately spoken of Catherine.  \xe2\x80\x9cDid she send me a\r\nmessage, or\xe2\x80\x94or anything?\xe2\x80\x9d Morris asked.  He appeared to think that she\r\nmight have sent him a trinket or a lock of her hair.\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman was slightly embarrassed, for she had not told her niece of\r\nher intended expedition.  \xe2\x80\x9cNot exactly a message,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nask her for one, because I was afraid to\xe2\x80\x94to excite her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid she is not very excitable!\xe2\x80\x9d  And Morris gave a smile of some\r\nbitterness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is better than that.  She is steadfast\xe2\x80\x94she is true!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think she will hold fast, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the death!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I hope it won\xe2\x80\x99t come to that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must be prepared for the worst, and that is what I wish to speak to\r\nyou about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you call the worst?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman, \xe2\x80\x9cmy brother\xe2\x80\x99s hard, intellectual nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is impervious to pity,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Penniman added, by way of explanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean that he won\xe2\x80\x99t come round?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will never be vanquished by argument.  I have studied him.  He will\r\nbe vanquished only by the accomplished fact.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe accomplished fact?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will come round afterwards,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman, with extreme\r\nsignificance.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe cares for nothing but facts; he must be met by facts!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Morris, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a fact that I wish to marry his daughter.\r\nI met him with that the other day, but he was not at all vanquished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman was silent a little, and her smile beneath the shadow of\r\nher capacious bonnet, on the edge of which her black veil was arranged\r\ncurtain-wise, fixed itself upon Morris\xe2\x80\x99s face with a still more tender\r\nbrilliancy.  \xe2\x80\x9cMarry Catherine first and meet him afterwards!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you recommend that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the young man, frowning heavily.\r\n\r\nShe was a little frightened, but she went on with considerable boldness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the way I see it: a private marriage\xe2\x80\x94a private marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d  She\r\nrepeated the phrase because she liked it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean that I should carry Catherine off?  What do they call\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94elope with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not a crime when you are driven to it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nhusband, as I have told you, was a distinguished clergyman; one of the\r\nmost eloquent men of his day.  He once married a young couple that had\r\nfled from the house of the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s father.  He was so interested in\r\ntheir story.  He had no hesitation, and everything came out beautifully.\r\nThe father was afterwards reconciled, and thought everything of the young\r\nman.  Mr. Penniman married them in the evening, about seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock.  The\r\nchurch was so dark, you could scarcely see; and Mr. Penniman was\r\nintensely agitated; he was so sympathetic.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he could have\r\ndone it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately Catherine and I have not Mr. Penniman to marry us,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMorris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but you have me!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mrs. Penniman expressively.  \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nperform the ceremony, but I can help you.  I can watch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe woman\xe2\x80\x99s an idiot,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Morris; but he was obliged to say\r\nsomething different.  It was not, however, materially more civil.  \xe2\x80\x9cWas\r\nit in order to tell me this that you requested I would meet you here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman had been conscious of a certain vagueness in her errand,\r\nand of not being able to offer him any very tangible reward for his long\r\nwalk.  \xe2\x80\x9cI thought perhaps you would like to see one who is so near to\r\nCatherine,\xe2\x80\x9d she observed, with considerable majesty.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd also,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you would value an opportunity of sending her something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris extended his empty hands with a melancholy smile.  \xe2\x80\x9cI am greatly\r\nobliged to you, but I have nothing to send.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you a _word_?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his companion, with her suggestive smile\r\ncoming back.\r\n\r\nMorris frowned again.  \xe2\x80\x9cTell her to hold fast,\xe2\x80\x9d he said rather curtly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a good word\xe2\x80\x94a noble word.  It will make her happy for many days.\r\nShe is very touching, very brave,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Penniman went on, arranging her\r\nmantle and preparing to depart.  While she was so engaged she had an\r\ninspiration.  She found the phrase that she could boldly offer as a\r\nvindication of the step she had taken.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf you marry Catherine at all\r\nrisks\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will give my brother a proof of your being what he\r\npretends to doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat he pretends to doubt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know what that is?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Penniman asked almost playfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does not concern me to know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris grandly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it makes you angry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI despise it,\xe2\x80\x9d Morris declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you know what it is, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman, shaking her finger\r\nat him.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe pretends that you like\xe2\x80\x94you like the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris hesitated a moment; and then, as if he spoke advisedly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI _do_\r\nlike the money!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but not\xe2\x80\x94but not as he means it.  You don\xe2\x80\x99t like it more than\r\nCatherine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe leaned his elbows on the table and buried his head in his hands.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ntorture me!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.  And, indeed, this was almost the effect of the\r\npoor lady\xe2\x80\x99s too importunate interest in his situation.\r\n\r\nBut she insisted on making her point.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf you marry her in spite of him,\r\nhe will take for granted that you expect nothing of him, and are prepared\r\nto do without it.  And so he will see that you are disinterested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris raised his head a little, following this argument, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what shall\r\nI gain by that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that he will see that he has been wrong in thinking that you wished\r\nto get his money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd seeing that I wish he would go to the deuce with it, he will leave\r\nit to a hospital.  Is that what you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Morris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that; though that would be very grand!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Penniman\r\nquickly added.  \xe2\x80\x9cI mean that having done you such an injustice, he will\r\nthink it his duty, at the end, to make some amends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris shook his head, though it must be confessed he was a little struck\r\nwith this idea.  \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think he is so sentimental?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not sentimental,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, to be perfectly fair\r\nto him, I think he has, in his own narrow way, a certain sense of duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere passed through Morris Townsend\xe2\x80\x99s mind a rapid wonder as to what he\r\nmight, even under a remote contingency, be indebted to from the action of\r\nthis principle in Dr. Sloper\xe2\x80\x99s breast, and the inquiry exhausted itself\r\nin his sense of the ludicrous.  \xe2\x80\x9cYour brother has no duties to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid presently, \xe2\x80\x9cand I none to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but he has duties to Catherine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but you see that on that principle Catherine has duties to him as\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman got up, with a melancholy sigh, as if she thought him very\r\nunimaginative.  \xe2\x80\x9cShe has always performed them faithfully; and now, do\r\nyou think she has no duties to _you_?\xe2\x80\x9d  Mrs. Penniman always, even in\r\nconversation, italicised her personal pronouns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would sound harsh to say so!  I am so grateful for her love,\xe2\x80\x9d Morris\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell her you said that!  And now, remember that if you need me, I\r\nam there.\xe2\x80\x9d  And Mrs. Penniman, who could think of nothing more to say,\r\nnodded vaguely in the direction of Washington Square.\r\n\r\nMorris looked some moments at the sanded floor of the shop; he seemed to\r\nbe disposed to linger a moment.  At last, looking up with a certain\r\nabruptness, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is your belief that if she marries me he will cut her\r\noff?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman stared a little, and smiled.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I have explained to you\r\nwhat I think would happen\xe2\x80\x94that in the end it would be the best thing to\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that, whatever she does, in the long run she will get the\r\nmoney?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t depend upon her, but upon you.  Venture to appear as\r\ndisinterested as you are!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman ingeniously.  Morris\r\ndropped his eyes on the sanded floor again, pondering this; and she\r\npursued.  \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Penniman and I had nothing, and we were very happy.\r\nCatherine, moreover, has her mother\xe2\x80\x99s fortune, which, at the time my\r\nsister-in-law married, was considered a very handsome one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris; and, indeed, it was quite\r\nsuperfluous, for he had contemplated the fact in all its lights.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAustin married a wife with money\xe2\x80\x94why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! but your brother was a doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d Morris objected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, all young men can\xe2\x80\x99t be doctors!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think it an extremely loathsome profession,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris, with\r\nan air of intellectual independence.  Then in a moment, he went on rather\r\ninconsequently, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose there is a will already made in\r\nCatherine\xe2\x80\x99s favour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so\xe2\x80\x94even doctors must die; and perhaps a little in mine,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nPenniman frankly added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you believe he would certainly change it\xe2\x80\x94as regards Catherine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and then change it back again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but one can\xe2\x80\x99t depend on that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to _depend_ on it?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Penniman asked.\r\n\r\nMorris blushed a little.  \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am certainly afraid of being the cause\r\nof an injury to Catherine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you must not be afraid.  Be afraid of nothing, and everything will\r\ngo well!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then Mrs. Penniman paid for her cup of tea, and Morris paid for his\r\noyster stew, and they went out together into the dimly-lighted wilderness\r\nof the Seventh Avenue.  The dusk had closed in completely and the street\r\nlamps were separated by wide intervals of a pavement in which cavities\r\nand fissures played a disproportionate part.  An omnibus, emblazoned with\r\nstrange pictures, went tumbling over the dislocated cobble-stones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow will you go home?\xe2\x80\x9d Morris asked, following this vehicle with an\r\ninterested eye.  Mrs. Penniman had taken his arm.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated a moment.  \xe2\x80\x9cI think this manner would be pleasant,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid; and she continued to let him feel the value of his support.\r\n\r\nSo he walked with her through the devious ways of the west side of the\r\ntown, and through the bustle of gathering nightfall in populous streets,\r\nto the quiet precinct of Washington Square.  They lingered a moment at\r\nthe foot of Dr. Sloper\xe2\x80\x99s white marble steps, above which a spotless white\r\ndoor, adorned with a glittering silver plate, seemed to figure, for\r\nMorris, the closed portal of happiness; and then Mrs. Penniman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompanion rested a melancholy eye upon a lighted window in the upper part\r\nof the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my room\xe2\x80\x94my dear little room!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Penniman remarked.\r\n\r\nMorris started.  \xe2\x80\x9cThen I needn\xe2\x80\x99t come walking round the Square to gaze at\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s as you please.  But Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s is behind; two noble windows on\r\nthe second floor.  I think you can see them from the other street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see them, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d  And Morris turned his back to the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell her you have been _here_, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman,\r\npointing to the spot where they stood; \xe2\x80\x9cand I will give her your\r\nmessage\xe2\x80\x94that she is to hold fast!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes! of course.  You know I write her all that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to say more when it is spoken!  And remember, if you need me,\r\nthat I am _there_\xe2\x80\x9d; and Mrs. Penniman glanced at the third floor.\r\n\r\nOn this they separated, and Morris, left to himself, stood looking at the\r\nhouse a moment; after which he turned away, and took a gloomy walk round\r\nthe Square, on the opposite side, close to the wooden fence.  Then he\r\ncame back, and paused for a minute in front of Dr. Sloper\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling.\r\nHis eyes travelled over it; they even rested on the ruddy windows of Mrs.\r\nPenniman\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.  He thought it a devilish comfortable house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. PENNIMAN told Catherine that evening\xe2\x80\x94the two ladies were sitting in\r\nthe back parlour\xe2\x80\x94that she had had an interview with Morris Townsend; and\r\non receiving this news the girl started with a sense of pain.  She felt\r\nangry for the moment; it was almost the first time she had ever felt\r\nangry.  It seemed to her that her aunt was meddlesome; and from this came\r\na vague apprehension that she would spoil something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you should have seen him.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it was right,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nCatherine said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was so sorry for him\xe2\x80\x94it seemed to me some one ought to see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one but I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine, who felt as if she were making the most\r\npresumptuous speech of her life, and yet at the same time had an instinct\r\nthat she was right in doing so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d Aunt Lavinia rejoined; \xe2\x80\x9cand I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat might have become of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not seen him, because my father has forbidden it,\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine said\r\nvery simply.\r\n\r\nThere was a simplicity in this, indeed, which fairly vexed Mrs. Penniman.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your father forbade you to go to sleep, I suppose you would keep\r\nawake!\xe2\x80\x9d she commented.\r\n\r\nCatherine looked at her.  \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you.  You seem to be very\r\nstrange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear, you will understand me some day!\xe2\x80\x9d  And Mrs. Penniman, who\r\nwas reading the evening paper, which she perused daily from the first\r\nline to the last, resumed her occupation.  She wrapped herself in\r\nsilence; she was determined Catherine should ask her for an account of\r\nher interview with Morris.  But Catherine was silent for so long, that\r\nshe almost lost patience; and she was on the point of remarking to her\r\nthat she was very heartless, when the girl at last spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he say?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said he is ready to marry you any day, in spite of everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine made no answer to this, and Mrs. Penniman almost lost patience\r\nagain; owing to which she at last volunteered the information that Morris\r\nlooked very handsome, but terribly haggard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he seem sad?\xe2\x80\x9d asked her niece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was dark under the eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman.  \xe2\x80\x9cSo different from\r\nwhen I first saw him; though I am not sure that if I had seen him in this\r\ncondition the first time, I should not have been even more struck with\r\nhim.  There is something brilliant in his very misery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was, to Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s sense, a vivid picture, and though she\r\ndisapproved, she felt herself gazing at it.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you see him?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked presently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn\xe2\x80\x94in the Bowery; at a confectioner\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman, who had a\r\ngeneral idea that she ought to dissemble a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhereabouts is the place?\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine inquired, after another pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you wish to go there, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said her aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no!\xe2\x80\x9d  And Catherine got up from her seat and went to the fire, where\r\nshe stood looking a while at the glowing coals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you so dry, Catherine?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Penniman said at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo dry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo cold\xe2\x80\x94so irresponsive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl turned very quickly.  \xe2\x80\x9cDid _he_ say that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman hesitated a moment.  \xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you what he said.  He\r\nsaid he feared only one thing\xe2\x80\x94that you would be afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfraid of what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfraid of your father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine turned back to the fire again, and then, after a pause, she\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI _am_ afraid of my father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman got quickly up from her chair and approached her niece.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to give him up, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine for some time never moved; she kept her eyes on the coals.  At\r\nlast she raised her head and looked at her aunt.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you push me\r\nso?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t push you.  When have I spoken to you before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me that you have spoken to me several times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid it is necessary, then, Catherine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman, with\r\na good deal of solemnity.  \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel the importance\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe paused a little; Catherine was looking at her.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe importance of\r\nnot disappointing that gallant young heart!\xe2\x80\x9d  And Mrs. Penniman went back\r\nto her chair, by the lamp, and, with a little jerk, picked up the evening\r\npaper again.\r\n\r\nCatherine stood there before the fire, with her hands behind her, looking\r\nat her aunt, to whom it seemed that the girl had never had just this dark\r\nfixedness in her gaze.  \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you understand\xe2\x80\x94or that you know\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I don\xe2\x80\x99t, it is not wonderful; you trust me so little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine made no attempt to deny this charge, and for some time more\r\nnothing was said.  But Mrs. Penniman\xe2\x80\x99s imagination was restless, and the\r\nevening paper failed on this occasion to enchain it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you succumb to the dread of your father\xe2\x80\x99s wrath,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what will become of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid _he_ tell you to say these things to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told me to use my influence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be mistaken,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe trusts me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope he may never repent of it!\xe2\x80\x9d  And Mrs. Penniman gave a little\r\nsharp slap to her newspaper.  She knew not what to make of her niece, who\r\nhad suddenly become stern and contradictious.\r\n\r\nThis tendency on Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s part was presently even more apparent.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nhad much better not make any more appointments with Mr. Townsend,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid.  \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman rose with considerable majesty.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy poor child, are you\r\njealous of me?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Aunt Lavinia!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Catherine, blushing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is your place to teach me what is right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn this point Catherine made no concession.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be right to\r\ndeceive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly have not deceived _you_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but I promised my father\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt you promised your father.  But I have promised him\r\nnothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine had to admit this, and she did so in silence.  \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe\r\nMr. Townsend himself likes it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t like meeting me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not in secret; the place was full of people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it was a secret place\xe2\x80\x94away off in the Bowery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman flinched a little.  \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen enjoy such things,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nremarked presently.  \xe2\x80\x9cI know what gentlemen like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like it, if he knew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray, do you propose to inform him?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Penniman inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Aunt Lavinia.  But please don\xe2\x80\x99t do it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I do it again, you will inform him: is that what you mean?  I do not\r\nshare your dread of my brother; I have always known how to defend my own\r\nposition.  But I shall certainly never again take any step on your\r\nbehalf; you are much too thankless.  I knew you were not a spontaneous\r\nnature, but I believed you were firm, and I told your father that he\r\nwould find you so.  I am disappointed\xe2\x80\x94but your father will not be!\xe2\x80\x9d  And\r\nwith this, Mrs. Penniman offered her niece a brief good-night, and\r\nwithdrew to her own apartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nCATHERINE sat alone by the parlour fire\xe2\x80\x94sat there for more than an hour,\r\nlost in her meditations.  Her aunt seemed to her aggressive and foolish,\r\nand to see it so clearly\xe2\x80\x94to judge Mrs. Penniman so positively\xe2\x80\x94made her\r\nfeel old and grave.  She did not resent the imputation of weakness; it\r\nmade no impression on her, for she had not the sense of weakness, and she\r\nwas not hurt at not being appreciated.  She had an immense respect for\r\nher father, and she felt that to displease him would be a misdemeanour\r\nanalogous to an act of profanity in a great temple; but her purpose had\r\nslowly ripened, and she believed that her prayers had purified it of its\r\nviolence.  The evening advanced, and the lamp burned dim without her\r\nnoticing it; her eyes were fixed upon her terrible plan.  She knew her\r\nfather was in his study\xe2\x80\x94that he had been there all the evening; from time\r\nto time she expected to hear him move.  She thought he would perhaps\r\ncome, as he sometimes came, into the parlour.  At last the clock struck\r\neleven, and the house was wrapped in silence; the servants had gone to\r\nbed.  Catherine got up and went slowly to the door of the library, where\r\nshe waited a moment, motionless.  Then she knocked, and then she waited\r\nagain.  Her father had answered her, but she had not the courage to turn\r\nthe latch.  What she had said to her aunt was true enough\xe2\x80\x94she was afraid\r\nof him; and in saying that she had no sense of weakness she meant that\r\nshe was not afraid of herself.  She heard him move within, and he came\r\nand opened the door for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Doctor.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou are standing there like a\r\nghost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went into the room, but it was some time before she contrived to say\r\nwhat she had come to say.  Her father, who was in his dressing-gown and\r\nslippers, had been busy at his writing-table, and after looking at her\r\nfor some moments, and waiting for her to speak, he went and seated\r\nhimself at his papers again.  His back was turned to her\xe2\x80\x94she began to\r\nhear the scratching of his pen.  She remained near the door, with her\r\nheart thumping beneath her bodice; and she was very glad that his back\r\nwas turned, for it seemed to her that she could more easily address\r\nherself to this portion of his person than to his face.  At last she\r\nbegan, watching it while she spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou told me that if I should have anything more to say about Mr.\r\nTownsend you would be glad to listen to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, not turning round, but stopping his\r\npen.\r\n\r\nCatherine wished it would go on, but she herself continued.  \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I\r\nwould tell you that I have not seen him again, but that I should like to\r\ndo so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo bid him good-bye?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Doctor.\r\n\r\nThe girl hesitated a moment.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe is not going away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor wheeled slowly round in his chair, with a smile that seemed to\r\naccuse her of an epigram; but extremes meet, and Catherine had not\r\nintended one.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not to bid him good-bye, then?\xe2\x80\x9d her father said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, father, not that; at least, not for ever.  I have not seen him\r\nagain, but I should like to see him,\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine repeated.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor slowly rubbed his under lip with the feather of his quill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you written to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, four times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not dismissed him, then.  Once would have done that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine; \xe2\x80\x9cI have asked him\xe2\x80\x94asked him to wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer father sat looking at her, and she was afraid he was going to break\r\nout into wrath; his eyes were so fine and cold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a dear, faithful child,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last.  \xe2\x80\x9cCome here to your\r\nfather.\xe2\x80\x9d  And he got up, holding out his hands toward her.\r\n\r\nThe words were a surprise, and they gave her an exquisite joy.  She went\r\nto him, and he put his arm round her tenderly, soothingly; and then he\r\nkissed her.  After this he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you wish to make me very happy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to\xe2\x80\x94but I am afraid I can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can if you will.  It all depends on your will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it to give him up?\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is to give him up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he held her still, with the same tenderness, looking into her face\r\nand resting his eyes on her averted eyes.  There was a long silence; she\r\nwished he would release her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are happier than I, father,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt you are unhappy just now.  But it is better to be\r\nunhappy for three months and get over it, than for many years and never\r\nget over it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if that were so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be so; I am sure of that.\xe2\x80\x9d  She answered nothing, and he went\r\non.  \xe2\x80\x9cHave you no faith in my wisdom, in my tenderness, in my solicitude\r\nfor your future?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, father!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you suppose that I know something of men: their vices, their\r\nfollies, their falsities?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe detached herself, and turned upon him.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe is not vicious\xe2\x80\x94he is not\r\nfalse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer father kept looking at her with his sharp, pure eye.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou make\r\nnothing of my judgement, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t believe that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to believe it, but to take it on trust.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine was far from saying to herself that this was an ingenious\r\nsophism; but she met the appeal none the less squarely.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has he\r\ndone\xe2\x80\x94what do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has never done anything\xe2\x80\x94he is a selfish idler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, father, don\xe2\x80\x99t abuse him!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed pleadingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to abuse him; it would be a great mistake.  You may do as\r\nyou choose,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may see him again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as you choose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you forgive me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will only be for once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean by once.  You must either give him up or\r\ncontinue the acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to explain\xe2\x80\x94to tell him to wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo wait for what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill you know him better\xe2\x80\x94till you consent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell him any such nonsense as that.  I know him well enough, and I\r\nshall never consent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we can wait a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Catherine, in a tone which was\r\nmeant to express the humblest conciliation, but which had upon her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s nerves the effect of an iteration not characterised by tact.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor answered, however, quietly enough: \xe2\x80\x9cOf course you can wait\r\ntill I die, if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d  Catherine gave a cry of natural horror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour engagement will have one delightful effect upon you; it will make\r\nyou extremely impatient for that event.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine stood staring, and the Doctor enjoyed the point he had made.\r\nIt came to Catherine with the force\xe2\x80\x94or rather with the vague\r\nimpressiveness\xe2\x80\x94of a logical axiom which it was not in her province to\r\ncontrovert; and yet, though it was a scientific truth, she felt wholly\r\nunable to accept it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather not marry, if that were true,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me a proof of it, then; for it is beyond a question that by\r\nengaging yourself to Morris Townsend you simply wait for my death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned away, feeling sick and faint; and the Doctor went on.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if\r\nyou wait for it with impatience, judge, if you please, what _his_\r\neagerness will be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine turned it over\xe2\x80\x94her father\xe2\x80\x99s words had such an authority for her\r\nthat her very thoughts were capable of obeying him.  There was a dreadful\r\nugliness in it, which seemed to glare at her through the interposing\r\nmedium of her own feebler reason.  Suddenly, however, she had an\r\ninspiration\xe2\x80\x94she almost knew it to be an inspiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I don\xe2\x80\x99t marry before your death, I will not after,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nTo her father, it must be admitted, this seemed only another epigram; and\r\nas obstinacy, in unaccomplished minds, does not usually select such a\r\nmode of expression, he was the more surprised at this wanton play of a\r\nfixed idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean that for an impertinence?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired; an inquiry of which,\r\nas he made it, he quite perceived the grossness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn impertinence?  Oh, father, what terrible things you say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t wait for my death, you might as well marry immediately;\r\nthere is nothing else to wait for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor some time Catherine made no answer; but finally she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think Morris\xe2\x80\x94little by little\xe2\x80\x94might persuade you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall never let him speak to me again.  I dislike him too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine gave a long, low sigh; she tried to stifle it, for she had made\r\nup her mind that it was wrong to make a parade of her trouble, and to\r\nendeavour to act upon her father by the meretricious aid of emotion.\r\nIndeed, she even thought it wrong\xe2\x80\x94in the sense of being inconsiderate\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nattempt to act upon his feelings at all; her part was to effect some\r\ngentle, gradual change in his intellectual perception of poor Morris\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharacter.  But the means of effecting such a change were at present\r\nshrouded in mystery, and she felt miserably helpless and hopeless.  She\r\nhad exhausted all arguments, all replies.  Her father might have pitied\r\nher, and in fact he did so; but he was sure he was right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one thing you can tell Mr. Townsend when you see him again,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cthat if you marry without my consent, I don\xe2\x80\x99t leave you a farthing\r\nof money.  That will interest him more than anything else you can tell\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be very right,\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine answered.  \xe2\x80\x9cI ought not in that\r\ncase to have a farthing of your money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child,\xe2\x80\x9d the Doctor observed, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cyour simplicity is\r\ntouching.  Make that remark, in that tone, and with that expression of\r\ncountenance, to Mr. Townsend, and take a note of his answer.  It won\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\npolite\xe2\x80\x94it will, express irritation; and I shall be glad of that, as it\r\nwill put me in the right; unless, indeed\xe2\x80\x94which is perfectly possible\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nshould like him the better for being rude to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will never be rude to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him what I say, all the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at her father, and her quiet eyes filled with tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I will see him, then,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, in her timid voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly as you choose!\xe2\x80\x9d  And he went to the door and opened it for her\r\nto go out.  The movement gave her a terrible sense of his turning her\r\noff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be only once, for the present,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, lingering a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly as you choose,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, standing there with his hand on the\r\ndoor.  \xe2\x80\x9cI have told you what I think.  If you see him, you will be an\r\nungrateful, cruel child; you will have given your old father the greatest\r\npain of his life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was more than the poor girl could bear; her tears overflowed, and\r\nshe moved towards her grimly consistent parent with a pitiful cry.  Her\r\nhands were raised in supplication, but he sternly evaded this appeal.\r\nInstead of letting her sob out her misery on his shoulder, he simply took\r\nher by the arm and directed her course across the threshold, closing the\r\ndoor gently but firmly behind her.  After he had done so, he remained\r\nlistening.  For a long time there was no sound; he knew that she was\r\nstanding outside.  He was sorry for her, as I have said; but he was so\r\nsure he was right.  At last he heard her move away, and then her footstep\r\ncreaked faintly upon the stairs.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor took several turns round his study, with his hands in his\r\npockets, and a thin sparkle, possibly of irritation, but partly also of\r\nsomething like humour, in his eye.  \xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nbelieve she will stick\xe2\x80\x94I believe she will stick!\xe2\x80\x9d  And this idea of\r\nCatherine \xe2\x80\x9csticking\xe2\x80\x9d appeared to have a comical side, and to offer a\r\nprospect of entertainment.  He determined, as he said to himself, to see\r\nit out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was for reasons connected with this determination that on the morrow\r\nhe sought a few words of private conversation with Mrs. Penniman.  He\r\nsent for her to the library, and he there informed her that he hoped very\r\nmuch that, as regarded this affair of Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s, she would mind her\r\n_p\xe2\x80\x99s_ and _q\xe2\x80\x99s_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean by such an expression,\xe2\x80\x9d said his sister.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak as if I were learning the alphabet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe alphabet of common sense is something you will never learn,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nDoctor permitted himself to respond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you called me here to insult me?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Penniman inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all.  Simply to advise you.  You have taken up young Townsend;\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s your own affair.  I have nothing to do with your sentiments, your\r\nfancies, your affections, your delusions; but what I request of you is\r\nthat you will keep these things to yourself.  I have explained my views\r\nto Catherine; she understands them perfectly, and anything that she does\r\nfurther in the way of encouraging Mr. Townsend\xe2\x80\x99s attentions will be in\r\ndeliberate opposition to my wishes.  Anything that you should do in the\r\nway of giving her aid and comfort will be\xe2\x80\x94permit me the\r\nexpression\xe2\x80\x94distinctly treasonable.  You know high treason is a capital\r\noffence; take care how you incur the penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman threw back her head, with a certain expansion of the eye\r\nwhich she occasionally practised.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me that you talk like a\r\ngreat autocrat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI talk like my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot like your sister\xe2\x80\x99s brother!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lavinia.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Lavinia,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cI sometimes wonder whether I am your brother.  We are so\r\nextremely different.  In spite of differences, however, we can, at a\r\npinch, understand each other; and that is the essential thing just now.\r\nWalk straight with regard to Mr. Townsend; that\xe2\x80\x99s all I ask.  It is\r\nhighly probable you have been corresponding with him for the last three\r\nweeks\xe2\x80\x94perhaps even seeing him.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you\xe2\x80\x94you needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d  He\r\nhad a moral conviction that she would contrive to tell a fib about the\r\nmatter, which it would disgust him to listen to.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever you have\r\ndone, stop doing it.  That\xe2\x80\x99s all I wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you wish also by chance to murder our child?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Penniman\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, I wish to make her live and be happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will kill her; she passed a dreadful night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe won\xe2\x80\x99t die of one dreadful night, nor of a dozen.  Remember that I am\r\na distinguished physician.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman hesitated a moment.  Then she risked her retort.  \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\nbeing a distinguished physician has not prevented you from already losing\r\n_two members_ of your family!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had risked it, but her brother gave her such a terribly incisive\r\nlook\xe2\x80\x94a look so like a surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s lancet\xe2\x80\x94that she was frightened at her\r\ncourage.  And he answered her in words that corresponded to the look: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nmay not prevent me, either, from losing the society of still another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman took herself off, with whatever air of depreciated merit\r\nwas at her command, and repaired to Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s room, where the poor girl\r\nwas closeted.  She knew all about her dreadful night, for the two had met\r\nagain, the evening before, after Catherine left her father.  Mrs.\r\nPenniman was on the landing of the second floor when her niece came\r\nupstairs.  It was not remarkable that a person of so much subtlety should\r\nhave discovered that Catherine had been shut up with the Doctor.  It was\r\nstill less remarkable that she should have felt an extreme curiosity to\r\nlearn the result of this interview, and that this sentiment, combined\r\nwith her great amiability and generosity, should have prompted her to\r\nregret the sharp words lately exchanged between her niece and herself.\r\nAs the unhappy girl came into sight, in the dusky corridor, she made a\r\nlively demonstration of sympathy.  Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s bursting heart was equally\r\noblivious.  She only knew that her aunt was taking her into her arms.\r\nMrs. Penniman drew her into Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s own room, and the two women sat\r\nthere together, far into the small hours; the younger one with her head\r\non the other\xe2\x80\x99s lap, sobbing and sobbing at first in a soundless, stifled\r\nmanner, and then at last perfectly still.  It gratified Mrs. Penniman to\r\nbe able to feel conscientiously that this scene virtually removed the\r\ninterdict which Catherine had placed upon her further communion with\r\nMorris Townsend.  She was not gratified, however, when, in coming back to\r\nher niece\xe2\x80\x99s room before breakfast, she found that Catherine had risen and\r\nwas preparing herself for this meal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should not go to breakfast,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are not well enough,\r\nafter your fearful night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am very well, and I am only afraid of being late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t understand you!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Penniman cried.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou should stay in bed\r\nfor three days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I could never do that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine, to whom this idea presented\r\nno attractions.\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman was in despair, and she noted, with extreme annoyance, that\r\nthe trace of the night\xe2\x80\x99s tears had completely vanished from Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes.  She had a most impracticable _physique_.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat effect do you\r\nexpect to have upon your father,\xe2\x80\x9d her aunt demanded, \xe2\x80\x9cif you come\r\nplumping down, without a vestige of any sort of feeling, as if nothing in\r\nthe world had happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would not like me to lie in bed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the more reason for your doing it.  How else do you expect to move\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine thought a little.  \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how; but not in that way.  I\r\nwish to be just as usual.\xe2\x80\x9d  And she finished dressing, and, according to\r\nher aunt\xe2\x80\x99s expression, went plumping down into the paternal presence.\r\nShe was really too modest for consistent pathos.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it was perfectly true that she had had a dreadful night.  Even\r\nafter Mrs. Penniman left her she had had no sleep.  She lay staring at\r\nthe uncomforting gloom, with her eyes and ears filled with the movement\r\nwith which her father had turned her out of his room, and of the words in\r\nwhich he had told her that she was a heartless daughter.  Her heart was\r\nbreaking.  She had heart enough for that.  At moments it seemed to her\r\nthat she believed him, and that to do what she was doing, a girl must\r\nindeed be bad.  She _was_ bad; but she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it.  She would try\r\nto appear good, even if her heart were perverted; and from time to time\r\nshe had a fancy that she might accomplish something by ingenious\r\nconcessions to form, though she should persist in caring for Morris.\r\nCatherine\xe2\x80\x99s ingenuities were indefinite, and we are not called upon to\r\nexpose their hollowness.  The best of them perhaps showed itself in that\r\nfreshness of aspect which was so discouraging to Mrs. Penniman, who was\r\namazed at the absence of haggardness in a young woman who for a whole\r\nnight had lain quivering beneath a father\xe2\x80\x99s curse.  Poor Catherine was\r\nconscious of her freshness; it gave her a feeling about the future which\r\nrather added to the weight upon her mind.  It seemed a proof that she was\r\nstrong and solid and dense, and would live to a great age\xe2\x80\x94longer than\r\nmight be generally convenient; and this idea was depressing, for it\r\nappeared to saddle her with a pretension the more, just when the\r\ncultivation of any pretension was inconsistent with her doing right.  She\r\nwrote that day to Morris Townsend, requesting him to come and see her on\r\nthe morrow; using very few words, and explaining nothing.  She would\r\nexplain everything face to face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\n\r\nON the morrow, in the afternoon, she heard his voice at the door, and his\r\nstep in the hall.  She received him in the big, bright front parlour, and\r\nshe instructed the servant that if any one should call she was\r\nparticularly engaged.  She was not afraid of her father\xe2\x80\x99s coming in, for\r\nat that hour he was always driving about town.  When Morris stood there\r\nbefore her, the first thing that she was conscious of was that he was\r\neven more beautiful to look at than fond recollection had painted him;\r\nthe next was that he had pressed her in his arms.  When she was free\r\nagain it appeared to her that she had now indeed thrown herself into the\r\ngulf of defiance, and even, for an instant, that she had been married to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe told her that she had been very cruel, and had made him very unhappy;\r\nand Catherine felt acutely the difficulty of her destiny, which forced\r\nher to give pain in such opposite quarters.  But she wished that, instead\r\nof reproaches, however tender, he would give her help; he was certainly\r\nwise enough, and clever enough, to invent some issue from their troubles.\r\nShe expressed this belief, and Morris received the assurance as if he\r\nthought it natural; but he interrogated, at first\xe2\x80\x94as was natural\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94rather than committed himself to marking out a course.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should not have made me wait so long,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I\r\nhave been living; every hour seemed like years.  You should have decided\r\nsooner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecided?\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecided whether you would keep me or give me up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Morris,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, with a long tender murmur, \xe2\x80\x9cI never thought of\r\ngiving you up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, then, were you waiting for?\xe2\x80\x9d  The young man was ardently logical.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought my father might\xe2\x80\x94might\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and she hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight see how unhappy you were?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no!  But that he might look at it differently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you have sent for me to tell me that at last he does so.  Is\r\nthat it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis hypothetical optimism gave the poor girl a pang.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Morris,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid solemnly, \xe2\x80\x9che looks at it still in the same way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why have you sent for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I wanted to see you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Catherine piteously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s an excellent reason, surely.  But did you want to look at me\r\nonly?  Have you nothing to tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis beautiful persuasive eyes were fixed upon her face, and she wondered\r\nwhat answer would be noble enough to make to such a gaze as that.  For a\r\nmoment her own eyes took it in, and then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI _did_ want to look at you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said gently.  But after this speech, most inconsistently, she hid her\r\nface.\r\n\r\nMorris watched her for a moment, attentively.  \xe2\x80\x9cWill you marry me\r\nto-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext week, then.  Any time within a month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it better to wait?\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo wait for what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hardly knew for what; but this tremendous leap alarmed her.  \xe2\x80\x9cTill we\r\nhave thought about it a little more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, sadly and reproachfully.  \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you had been\r\nthinking about it these three weeks.  Do you want to turn it over in your\r\nmind for five years?  You have given me more than time enough.  My poor\r\ngirl,\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are not sincere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine coloured from brow to chin, and her eyes filled with tears.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how can you say that?\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you must take me or leave me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris, very reasonably.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t please your father and me both; you must choose between us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have chosen you!\xe2\x80\x9d she said passionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen marry me next week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stood gazing at him.  \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t there any other way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone that I know of for arriving at the same result.  If there is, I\r\nshould be happy to hear of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine could think of nothing of the kind, and Morris\xe2\x80\x99s luminosity\r\nseemed almost pitiless.  The only thing she could think of was that her\r\nfather might, after all, come round, and she articulated, with an awkward\r\nsense of her helplessness in doing so, a wish that this miracle might\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think it is in the least degree likely?\xe2\x80\x9d Morris asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be, if he could only know you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can know me if he will.  What is to prevent it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis ideas, his reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.  \xe2\x80\x9cThey are so\xe2\x80\x94so terribly\r\nstrong.\xe2\x80\x9d  She trembled with the recollection of them yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrong?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Morris.  \xe2\x80\x9cI would rather you should think them weak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing about my father is weak!\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl.\r\n\r\nMorris turned away, walking to the window, where he stood looking out.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are terribly afraid of him!\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked at last.\r\n\r\nShe felt no impulse to deny it, because she had no shame in it; for if it\r\nwas no honour to herself, at least it was an honour to him.  \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I\r\nmust be,\xe2\x80\x9d she said simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you don\xe2\x80\x99t love me\xe2\x80\x94not as I love you.  If you fear your father more\r\nthan you love me, then your love is not what I hoped it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my friend!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, going to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo _I_ fear anything?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded, turning round on her.  \xe2\x80\x9cFor your\r\nsake what am I not ready to face?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are noble\xe2\x80\x94you are brave!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, stopping short at a distance\r\nthat was almost respectful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSmall good it does me, if you are so timid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think that I am\xe2\x80\x94_really_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean by \xe2\x80\x98really.\xe2\x80\x99  It is really enough to make us\r\nmiserable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be strong enough to wait\xe2\x80\x94to wait a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd suppose after a long time your father should hate me worse than\r\never?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would be touched by my fidelity?  Is that what you mean?  If he is so\r\neasily touched, then why should you be afraid of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was much to the point, and Catherine was struck by it.  \xe2\x80\x9cI will try\r\nnot to be,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.  And she stood there submissively, the image, in\r\nadvance, of a dutiful and responsible wife.  This image could not fail to\r\nrecommend itself to Morris Townsend, and he continued to give proof of\r\nthe high estimation in which he held her.  It could only have been at the\r\nprompting of such a sentiment that he presently mentioned to her that the\r\ncourse recommended by Mrs. Penniman was an immediate union, regardless of\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Aunt Penniman would like that,\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine said simply\xe2\x80\x94and yet with\r\na certain shrewdness.  It must, however, have been in pure simplicity,\r\nand from motives quite untouched by sarcasm, that, a few moments after,\r\nshe went on to say to Morris that her father had given her a message for\r\nhim.  It was quite on her conscience to deliver this message, and had the\r\nmission been ten times more painful she would have as scrupulously\r\nperformed it.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe told me to tell you\xe2\x80\x94to tell you very distinctly, and\r\ndirectly from himself, that if I marry without his consent, I shall not\r\ninherit a penny of his fortune.  He made a great point of this.  He\r\nseemed to think\xe2\x80\x94he seemed to think\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris flushed, as any young man of spirit might have flushed at an\r\nimputation of baseness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he seem to think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat it would make a difference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _will_ make a difference\xe2\x80\x94in many things.  We shall be by many\r\nthousands of dollars the poorer; and that is a great difference.  But it\r\nwill make none in my affection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall not want the money,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine; \xe2\x80\x9cfor you know I have a\r\ngood deal myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear girl, I know you have something.  And he can\xe2\x80\x99t touch that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would never,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy mother left it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris was silent a while.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe was very positive about this, was he?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked at last.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe thought such a message would annoy me terribly, and\r\nmake me throw off the mask, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine wearily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease tell him that I care for his message as much as for that!\xe2\x80\x9d  And\r\nMorris snapped his fingers sonorously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I could tell him that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know you sometimes disappoint me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think I might.  I disappoint every one\xe2\x80\x94father and Aunt\r\nPenniman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter with me, because I am fonder of you than they\r\nare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Morris,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, with her imagination\xe2\x80\x94what there was of\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94swimming in this happy truth, which seemed, after all, invidious to no\r\none.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it your belief that he will stick to it\xe2\x80\x94stick to it for ever, to this\r\nidea of disinheriting you?\xe2\x80\x94that your goodness and patience will never\r\nwear out his cruelty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe trouble is that if I marry you, he will think I am not good.  He\r\nwill think that a proof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, then, he will never forgive you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis idea, sharply expressed by Morris\xe2\x80\x99s handsome lips, renewed for a\r\nmoment, to the poor girl\xe2\x80\x99s temporarily pacified conscience, all its\r\ndreadful vividness.  \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you must love me very much!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no doubt of that, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d her lover rejoined.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike that word \xe2\x80\x98disinherited,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t the money; it is that he should\xe2\x80\x94that he should feel so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it seems to you a kind of curse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be\r\nvery dismal.  But don\xe2\x80\x99t you think,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on presently, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if you\r\nwere to try to be very clever, and to set rightly about it, you might in\r\nthe end conjure it away?  Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued further, in a\r\ntone of sympathetic speculation, \xe2\x80\x9cthat a really clever woman, in your\r\nplace, might bring him round at last?  Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere, suddenly, Morris was interrupted; these ingenious inquiries had not\r\nreached Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s ears.  The terrible word \xe2\x80\x9cdisinheritance,\xe2\x80\x9d with all\r\nits impressive moral reprobation, was still ringing there; seemed indeed\r\nto gather force as it lingered.  The mortal chill of her situation struck\r\nmore deeply into her child-like heart, and she was overwhelmed by a\r\nfeeling of loneliness and danger.  But her refuge was there, close to\r\nher, and she put out her hands to grasp it.  \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Morris,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with\r\na shudder, \xe2\x80\x9cI will marry you as soon as you please.\xe2\x80\x9d  And she surrendered\r\nherself, leaning her head on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear good girl!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, looking down at his prize.  And then\r\nhe looked up again, rather vaguely, with parted lips and lifted eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. SLOPER very soon imparted his conviction to Mrs. Almond, in the same\r\nterms in which he had announced it to himself.  \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s going to stick, by\r\nJove! she\xe2\x80\x99s going to stick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean that she is going to marry him?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Almond inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that; but she is not going to break down.  She is going to\r\ndrag out the engagement, in the hope of making me relent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd shall you not relent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall a geometrical proposition relent?  I am not so superficial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t geometry treat of surfaces?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Almond, who, as we know,\r\nwas clever, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but it treats of them profoundly.  Catherine and her young man are\r\nmy surfaces; I have taken their measure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak as if it surprised you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is immense; there will be a great deal to observe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are shockingly cold-blooded!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Almond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI need to be with all this hot blood about me.  Young Townsend indeed is\r\ncool; I must allow him that merit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t judge him,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Almond answered; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am not at all surprised\r\nat Catherine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI confess I am a little; she must have been so deucedly divided and\r\nbothered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay it amuses you outright!  I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why it should be such a joke\r\nthat your daughter adores you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the point where the adoration stops that I find it interesting to\r\nfix.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt stops where the other sentiment begins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all\xe2\x80\x94that would be simple enough.  The two things are extremely\r\nmixed up, and the mixture is extremely odd.  It will produce some third\r\nelement, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what I am waiting to see.  I wait with suspense\xe2\x80\x94with\r\npositive excitement; and that is a sort of emotion that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t suppose\r\nCatherine would ever provide for me.  I am really very much obliged to\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will cling,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Almond; \xe2\x80\x9cshe will certainly cling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; as I say, she will stick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCling is prettier.  That\xe2\x80\x99s what those very simple natures always do, and\r\nnothing could be simpler than Catherine.  She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take many\r\nimpressions; but when she takes one she keeps it.  She is like a copper\r\nkettle that receives a dent; you may polish up the kettle, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nefface the mark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must try and polish up Catherine,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor.  \xe2\x80\x9cI will take her\r\nto Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe won\xe2\x80\x99t forget him in Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will forget her, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Almond looked grave.  \xe2\x80\x9cShould you really like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExtremely!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor.\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman, meanwhile, lost little time in putting herself again in\r\ncommunication with Morris Townsend.  She requested him to favour her with\r\nanother interview, but she did not on this occasion select an oyster\r\nsaloon as the scene of their meeting.  She proposed that he should join\r\nher at the door of a certain church, after service on Sunday afternoon,\r\nand she was careful not to appoint the place of worship which she usually\r\nvisited, and where, as she said, the congregation would have spied upon\r\nher.  She picked out a less elegant resort, and on issuing from its\r\nportal at the hour she had fixed she saw the young man standing apart.\r\nShe offered him no recognition till she had crossed the street and he had\r\nfollowed her to some distance.  Here, with a smile\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse my apparent\r\nwant of cordiality,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou know what to believe about that.\r\nPrudence before everything.\xe2\x80\x9d  And on his asking her in what direction\r\nthey should walk, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere we shall be least observed,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\nMorris was not in high good-humour, and his response to this speech was\r\nnot particularly gallant.  \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t flatter myself we shall be much\r\nobserved anywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d  Then he turned recklessly toward the centre of the\r\ntown.  \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you have come to tell me that he has knocked under,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I am not altogether a harbinger of good; and yet, too, I am\r\nto a certain extent a messenger of peace.  I have been thinking a great\r\ndeal, Mr. Townsend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I do; but I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it, my mind is so terribly active.\r\nWhen I give myself, I give myself.  I pay the penalty in my headaches, my\r\nfamous headaches\xe2\x80\x94a perfect circlet of pain!  But I carry it as a queen\r\ncarries her crown.  Would you believe that I have one now?  I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nhowever, have missed our rendezvous for anything.  I have something very\r\nimportant to tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let\xe2\x80\x99s have it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was perhaps a little headlong the other day in advising you to marry\r\nimmediately.  I have been thinking it over, and now I see it just a\r\nlittle differently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to have a great many different ways of seeing the same object.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir number is infinite!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman, in a tone which seemed to\r\nsuggest that this convenient faculty was one of her brightest attributes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI recommend you to take one way and stick to it,\xe2\x80\x9d Morris replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t easy to choose.  My imagination is never quiet, never\r\nsatisfied.  It makes me a bad adviser, perhaps; but it makes me a capital\r\nfriend!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA capital friend who gives bad advice!\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot intentionally\xe2\x80\x94and who hurries off, at every risk, to make the most\r\nhumble excuses!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what do you advise me now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be very patient; to watch and wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is that bad advice or good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not for me to say,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Penniman rejoined, with some dignity.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only pretend it\xe2\x80\x99s sincere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will you come to me next week and recommend something different and\r\nequally sincere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may come to you next week and tell you that I am in the streets!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the streets?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had a terrible scene with my brother, and he threatens, if\r\nanything happens, to turn me out of the house.  You know I am a poor\r\nwoman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris had a speculative idea that she had a little property; but he\r\nnaturally did not press this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be very sorry to see you suffer martyrdom for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you make your brother out a regular Turk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman hesitated a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly do not regard Austin as a satisfactory Christian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd am I to wait till he is converted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, at any rate, till he is less violent.  Bide your time, Mr.\r\nTownsend; remember the prize is great!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris walked along some time in silence, tapping the railings and\r\ngateposts very sharply with his stick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou certainly are devilish inconsistent!\xe2\x80\x9d he broke out at last.  \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nalready got Catherine to consent to a private marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman was indeed inconsistent, for at this news she gave a little\r\njump of gratification.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! when and where?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.  And then she stopped short.\r\n\r\nMorris was a little vague about this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat isn\xe2\x80\x99t fixed; but she consents.  It\xe2\x80\x99s deuced awkward, now, to back\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman, as I say, had stopped short; and she stood there with her\r\neyes fixed brilliantly on her companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Townsend,\xe2\x80\x9d she proceeded, \xe2\x80\x9cshall I tell you something?  Catherine\r\nloves you so much that you may do anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis declaration was slightly ambiguous, and Morris opened his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am happy to hear it!  But what do you mean by \xe2\x80\x98anything\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may postpone\xe2\x80\x94you may change about; she won\xe2\x80\x99t think the worse of\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris stood there still, with his raised eyebrows; then he said simply\r\nand rather dryly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d  After this he remarked to Mrs. Penniman that if\r\nshe walked so slowly she would attract notice, and he succeeded, after a\r\nfashion, in hurrying her back to the domicile of which her tenure had\r\nbecome so insecure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nHE had slightly misrepresented the matter in saying that Catherine had\r\nconsented to take the great step.  We left her just now declaring that\r\nshe would burn her ships behind her; but Morris, after having elicited\r\nthis declaration, had become conscious of good reasons for not taking it\r\nup.  He avoided, gracefully enough, fixing a day, though he left her\r\nunder the impression that he had his eye on one.  Catherine may have had\r\nher difficulties; but those of her circumspect suitor are also worthy of\r\nconsideration.  The prize was certainly great; but it was only to be won\r\nby striking the happy mean between precipitancy and caution.  It would be\r\nall very well to take one\xe2\x80\x99s jump and trust to Providence; Providence was\r\nmore especially on the side of clever people, and clever people were\r\nknown by an indisposition to risk their bones.  The ultimate reward of a\r\nunion with a young woman who was both unattractive and impoverished ought\r\nto be connected with immediate disadvantages by some very palpable chain.\r\nBetween the fear of losing Catherine and her possible fortune altogether,\r\nand the fear of taking her too soon and finding this possible fortune as\r\nvoid of actuality as a collection of emptied bottles, it was not\r\ncomfortable for Morris Townsend to choose; a fact that should be\r\nremembered by readers disposed to judge harshly of a young man who may\r\nhave struck them as making but an indifferently successful use of fine\r\nnatural parts.  He had not forgotten that in any event Catherine had her\r\nown ten thousand a year; he had devoted an abundance of meditation to\r\nthis circumstance.  But with his fine parts he rated himself high, and he\r\nhad a perfectly definite appreciation of his value, which seemed to him\r\ninadequately represented by the sum I have mentioned.  At the same time\r\nhe reminded himself that this sum was considerable, that everything is\r\nrelative, and that if a modest income is less desirable than a large one,\r\nthe complete absence of revenue is nowhere accounted an advantage.  These\r\nreflexions gave him plenty of occupation, and made it necessary that he\r\nshould trim his sail.  Dr. Sloper\xe2\x80\x99s opposition was the unknown quantity\r\nin the problem he had to work out.  The natural way to work it out was by\r\nmarrying Catherine; but in mathematics there are many short cuts, and\r\nMorris was not without a hope that he should yet discover one.  When\r\nCatherine took him at his word and consented to renounce the attempt to\r\nmollify her father, he drew back skilfully enough, as I have said, and\r\nkept the wedding-day still an open question.  Her faith in his sincerity\r\nwas so complete that she was incapable of suspecting that he was playing\r\nwith her; her trouble just now was of another kind.  The poor girl had an\r\nadmirable sense of honour; and from the moment she had brought herself to\r\nthe point of violating her father\xe2\x80\x99s wish, it seemed to her that she had\r\nno right to enjoy his protection.  It was on her conscience that she\r\nought to live under his roof only so long as she conformed to his wisdom.\r\nThere was a great deal of glory in such a position, but poor Catherine\r\nfelt that she had forfeited her claim to it.  She had cast her lot with a\r\nyoung man against whom he had solemnly warned her, and broken the\r\ncontract under which he provided her with a happy home.  She could not\r\ngive up the young man, so she must leave the home; and the sooner the\r\nobject of her preference offered her another the sooner her situation\r\nwould lose its awkward twist.  This was close reasoning; but it was\r\ncommingled with an infinite amount of merely instinctive penitence.\r\nCatherine\xe2\x80\x99s days at this time were dismal, and the weight of some of her\r\nhours was almost more than she could bear.  Her father never looked at\r\nher, never spoke to her.  He knew perfectly what he was about, and this\r\nwas part of a plan.  She looked at him as much as she dared (for she was\r\nafraid of seeming to offer herself to his observation), and she pitied\r\nhim for the sorrow she had brought upon him.  She held up her head and\r\nbusied her hands, and went about her daily occupations; and when the\r\nstate of things in Washington Square seemed intolerable, she closed her\r\neyes and indulged herself with an intellectual vision of the man for\r\nwhose sake she had broken a sacred law.  Mrs. Penniman, of the three\r\npersons in Washington Square, had much the most of the manner that\r\nbelongs to a great crisis.  If Catherine was quiet, she was quietly\r\nquiet, as I may say, and her pathetic effects, which there was no one to\r\nnotice, were entirely unstudied and unintended.  If the Doctor was stiff\r\nand dry and absolutely indifferent to the presence of his companions, it\r\nwas so lightly, neatly, easily done, that you would have had to know him\r\nwell to discover that, on the whole, he rather enjoyed having to be so\r\ndisagreeable.  But Mrs. Penniman was elaborately reserved and\r\nsignificantly silent; there was a richer rustle in the very deliberate\r\nmovements to which she confined herself, and when she occasionally spoke,\r\nin connexion with some very trivial event, she had the air of meaning\r\nsomething deeper than what she said.  Between Catherine and her father\r\nnothing had passed since the evening she went to speak to him in his\r\nstudy.  She had something to say to him\xe2\x80\x94it seemed to her she ought to say\r\nit; but she kept it back, for fear of irritating him.  He also had\r\nsomething to say to her; but he was determined not to speak first.  He\r\nwas interested, as we know, in seeing how, if she were left to herself,\r\nshe would \xe2\x80\x9cstick.\xe2\x80\x9d  At last she told him she had seen Morris Townsend\r\nagain, and that their relations remained quite the same.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we shall marry\xe2\x80\x94before very long.  And probably, meanwhile, I\r\nshall see him rather often; about once a week, not more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor looked at her coldly from head to foot, as if she had been a\r\nstranger.  It was the first time his eyes had rested on her for a week,\r\nwhich was fortunate, if that was to be their expression.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not three\r\ntimes a day?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat prevents your meeting as often as you\r\nchoose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned away a moment; there were tears in her eyes.  Then she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is better once a week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see how it is better.  It is as bad as it can be.  If you\r\nflatter yourself that I care for little modifications of that sort, you\r\nare very much mistaken.  It is as wrong of you to see him once a week as\r\nit would be to see him all day long.  Not that it matters to me,\r\nhowever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine tried to follow these words, but they seemed to lead towards a\r\nvague horror from which she recoiled.  \xe2\x80\x9cI think we shall marry pretty\r\nsoon,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated at last.\r\n\r\nHer father gave her his dreadful look again, as if she were some one\r\nelse.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you tell me that?  It\xe2\x80\x99s no concern of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, father!\xe2\x80\x9d she broke out, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you care, even if you do feel so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a button.  Once you marry, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite the same to me when or where\r\nor why you do it; and if you think to compound for your folly by hoisting\r\nyour flag in this way, you may spare yourself the trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this he turned away.  But the next day he spoke to her of his own\r\naccord, and his manner was somewhat changed.  \xe2\x80\x9cShall you be married\r\nwithin the next four or five months?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not very easy for us to\r\nmake up our minds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut it off, then, for six months, and in the meantime I will take you to\r\nEurope.  I should like you very much to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt gave her such delight, after his words of the day before, to hear that\r\nhe should \xe2\x80\x9clike\xe2\x80\x9d her to do something, and that he still had in his heart\r\nany of the tenderness of preference, that she gave a little exclamation\r\nof joy.  But then she became conscious that Morris was not included in\r\nthis proposal, and that\xe2\x80\x94as regards really going\xe2\x80\x94she would greatly prefer\r\nto remain at home with him.  But she blushed, none the less, more\r\ncomfortably than she had done of late.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be delightful to go to\r\nEurope,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked, with a sense that the idea was not original, and\r\nthat her tone was not all it might be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then, we will go.  Pack up your clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had better tell Mr. Townsend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\nHer father fixed his cold eyes upon her.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf you mean that you had\r\nbetter ask his leave, all that remains to me is to hope he will give it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl was sharply touched by the pathetic ring of the words; it was\r\nthe most calculated, the most dramatic little speech the Doctor had ever\r\nuttered.  She felt that it was a great thing for her, under the\r\ncircumstances, to have this fine opportunity of showing him her respect;\r\nand yet there was something else that she felt as well, and that she\r\npresently expressed.  \xe2\x80\x9cI sometimes think that if I do what you dislike so\r\nmuch, I ought not to stay with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo stay with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I live with you, I ought to obey you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that\xe2\x80\x99s your theory, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, with a dry\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I don\xe2\x80\x99t obey you, I ought not to live with you\xe2\x80\x94to enjoy your\r\nkindness and protection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis striking argument gave the Doctor a sudden sense of having\r\nunderestimated his daughter; it seemed even more than worthy of a young\r\nwoman who had revealed the quality of unaggressive obstinacy.  But it\r\ndispleased him\xe2\x80\x94displeased him deeply, and he signified as much.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nidea is in very bad taste,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \xe2\x80\x9cDid you get it from Mr. Townsend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no; it\xe2\x80\x99s my own!\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep it to yourself, then,\xe2\x80\x9d her father answered, more than ever\r\ndetermined she should go to Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIF Morris Townsend was not to be included in this journey, no more was\r\nMrs. Penniman, who would have been thankful for an invitation, but who\r\n(to do her justice) bore her disappointment in a perfectly ladylike\r\nmanner.  \xe2\x80\x9cI should enjoy seeing the works of Raphael and the ruins\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nruins of the Pantheon,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Mrs. Almond; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, on the other hand,\r\nI shall not be sorry to be alone and at peace for the next few months in\r\nWashington Square.  I want rest; I have been through so much in the last\r\nfour months.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mrs. Almond thought it rather cruel that her brother\r\nshould not take poor Lavinia abroad; but she easily understood that, if\r\nthe purpose of his expedition was to make Catherine forget her lover, it\r\nwas not in his interest to give his daughter this young man\xe2\x80\x99s best friend\r\nas a companion.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf Lavinia had not been so foolish, she might visit the\r\nruins of the Pantheon,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself; and she continued to regret\r\nher sister\xe2\x80\x99s folly, even though the latter assured her that she had often\r\nheard the relics in question most satisfactorily described by Mr.\r\nPenniman.  Mrs. Penniman was perfectly aware that her brother\xe2\x80\x99s motive in\r\nundertaking a foreign tour was to lay a trap for Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s constancy;\r\nand she imparted this conviction very frankly to her niece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe thinks it will make you forget Morris,\xe2\x80\x9d she said (she always called\r\nthe young man \xe2\x80\x9cMorris\xe2\x80\x9d now); \xe2\x80\x9cout of sight, out of mind, you know.  He\r\nthinks that all the things you will see over there will drive him out of\r\nyour thoughts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine looked greatly alarmed.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf he thinks that, I ought to tell\r\nhim beforehand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman shook her head.  \xe2\x80\x9cTell him afterwards, my dear!  After he\r\nhas had all the trouble and the expense!  That\xe2\x80\x99s the way to serve him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd she added, in a softer key, that it must be delightful to think of\r\nthose who love us among the ruins of the Pantheon.\r\n\r\nHer father\xe2\x80\x99s displeasure had cost the girl, as we know, a great deal of\r\ndeep-welling sorrow\xe2\x80\x94sorrow of the purest and most generous kind, without\r\na touch of resentment or rancour; but for the first time, after he had\r\ndismissed with such contemptuous brevity her apology for being a charge\r\nupon him, there was a spark of anger in her grief.  She had felt his\r\ncontempt; it had scorched her; that speech about her bad taste made her\r\nears burn for three days.  During this period she was less considerate;\r\nshe had an idea\xe2\x80\x94a rather vague one, but it was agreeable to her sense of\r\ninjury\xe2\x80\x94that now she was absolved from penance, and might do what she\r\nchose.  She chose to write to Morris Townsend to meet her in the Square\r\nand take her to walk about the town.  If she were going to Europe out of\r\nrespect to her father, she might at least give herself this satisfaction.\r\nShe felt in every way at present more free and more resolute; there was a\r\nforce that urged her.  Now at last, completely and unreservedly, her\r\npassion possessed her.\r\n\r\nMorris met her at last, and they took a long walk.  She told him\r\nimmediately what had happened\xe2\x80\x94that her father wished to take her away.\r\nIt would be for six months, to Europe; she would do absolutely what\r\nMorris should think best.  She hoped inexpressibly that he would think it\r\nbest she should stay at home.  It was some time before he said what he\r\nthought: he asked, as they walked along, a great many questions.  There\r\nwas one that especially struck her; it seemed so incongruous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you like to see all those celebrated things over there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, Morris!\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine, quite deprecatingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGracious Heaven, what a dull woman!\xe2\x80\x9d Morris exclaimed to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe thinks I will forget you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine: \xe2\x80\x9cthat all these things\r\nwill drive you out of my mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear, perhaps they will!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t say that,\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine answered gently, as they walked along.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor father will be disappointed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris gave a little laugh.  \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I verily believe that your poor father\r\nwill be disappointed!  But you will have seen Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d he added\r\nhumorously.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a take-in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care for seeing Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to care, my dear.  And it may mollify your father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine, conscious of her obstinacy, expected little of this, and could\r\nnot rid herself of the idea that in going abroad and yet remaining firm,\r\nshe should play her father a trick.  \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think it would be a kind\r\nof deception?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t he want to deceive you?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Morris.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt will serve him\r\nright!  I really think you had better go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not be married for so long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe married when you come back.  You can buy your wedding clothes in\r\nParis.\xe2\x80\x9d  And then Morris, with great kindness of tone, explained his view\r\nof the matter.  It would be a good thing that she should go; it would put\r\nthem completely in the right.  It would show they were reasonable and\r\nwilling to wait.  Once they were so sure of each other, they could afford\r\nto wait\xe2\x80\x94what had they to fear?  If there was a particle of chance that\r\nher father would be favourably affected by her going, that ought to\r\nsettle it; for, after all, Morris was very unwilling to be the cause of\r\nher being disinherited.  It was not for himself, it was for her and for\r\nher children.  He was willing to wait for her; it would be hard, but he\r\ncould do it.  And over there, among beautiful scenes and noble monuments,\r\nperhaps the old gentleman would be softened; such things were supposed to\r\nexert a humanising influence.  He might be touched by her gentleness, her\r\npatience, her willingness to make any sacrifice but _that_ one; and if\r\nshe should appeal to him some day, in some celebrated spot\xe2\x80\x94in Italy, say,\r\nin the evening; in Venice, in a gondola, by moonlight\xe2\x80\x94if she should be a\r\nlittle clever about it and touch the right chord, perhaps he would fold\r\nher in his arms and tell her that he forgave her.  Catherine was\r\nimmensely struck with this conception of the affair, which seemed\r\neminently worthy of her lover\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant intellect; though she viewed it\r\naskance in so far as it depended upon her own powers of execution.  The\r\nidea of being \xe2\x80\x9cclever\xe2\x80\x9d in a gondola by moonlight appeared to her to\r\ninvolve elements of which her grasp was not active.  But it was settled\r\nbetween them that she should tell her father that she was ready to follow\r\nhim obediently anywhere, making the mental reservation that she loved\r\nMorris Townsend more than ever.\r\n\r\nShe informed the Doctor she was ready to embark, and he made rapid\r\narrangements for this event.  Catherine had many farewells to make, but\r\nwith only two of them are we actively concerned.  Mrs. Penniman took a\r\ndiscriminating view of her niece\xe2\x80\x99s journey; it seemed to her very proper\r\nthat Mr. Townsend\xe2\x80\x99s destined bride should wish to embellish her mind by a\r\nforeign tour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou leave him in good hands,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pressing her lips to Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nforehead.  (She was very fond of kissing people\xe2\x80\x99s foreheads; it was an\r\ninvoluntary expression of sympathy with the intellectual part.)  \xe2\x80\x9cI shall\r\nsee him often; I shall feel like one of the vestals of old, tending the\r\nsacred flame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou behave beautifully about not going with us,\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine answered, not\r\npresuming to examine this analogy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my pride that keeps me up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman, tapping the body\r\nof her dress, which always gave forth a sort of metallic ring.\r\n\r\nCatherine\xe2\x80\x99s parting with her lover was short, and few words were\r\nexchanged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I find you just the same when I come back?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked; though the\r\nquestion was not the fruit of scepticism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same\xe2\x80\x94only more so!\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris, smiling.\r\n\r\nIt does not enter into our scheme to narrate in detail Dr. Sloper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproceedings in the eastern hemisphere.  He made the grand tour of Europe,\r\ntravelled in considerable splendour, and (as was to have been expected in\r\na man of his high cultivation) found so much in art and antiquity to\r\ninterest him, that he remained abroad, not for six months, but for\r\ntwelve.  Mrs. Penniman, in Washington Square, accommodated herself to his\r\nabsence.  She enjoyed her uncontested dominion in the empty house, and\r\nflattered herself that she made it more attractive to their friends than\r\nwhen her brother was at home.  To Morris Townsend, at least, it would\r\nhave appeared that she made it singularly attractive.  He was altogether\r\nher most frequent visitor, and Mrs. Penniman was very fond of asking him\r\nto tea.  He had his chair\xe2\x80\x94a very easy one at the fireside in the back\r\nparlour (when the great mahogany sliding-doors, with silver knobs and\r\nhinges, which divided this apartment from its more formal neighbour, were\r\nclosed), and he used to smoke cigars in the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s study, where he\r\noften spent an hour in turning over the curious collections of its absent\r\nproprietor.  He thought Mrs. Penniman a goose, as we know; but he was no\r\ngoose himself, and, as a young man of luxurious tastes and scanty\r\nresources, he found the house a perfect castle of indolence.  It became\r\nfor him a club with a single member.  Mrs. Penniman saw much less of her\r\nsister than while the Doctor was at home; for Mrs. Almond had felt moved\r\nto tell her that she disapproved of her relations with Mr. Townsend.  She\r\nhad no business to be so friendly to a young man of whom their brother\r\nthought so meanly, and Mrs. Almond was surprised at her levity in\r\nfoisting a most deplorable engagement upon Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeplorable?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lavinia.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe will make her a lovely husband!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in lovely husbands,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Almond; \xe2\x80\x9cI only believe\r\nin good ones.  If he marries her, and she comes into Austin\xe2\x80\x99s money, they\r\nmay get on.  He will be an idle, amiable, selfish, and doubtless\r\ntolerably good-natured fellow.  But if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get the money and he\r\nfinds himself tied to her, Heaven have mercy on her!  He will have none.\r\nHe will hate her for his disappointment, and take his revenge; he will be\r\npitiless and cruel.  Woe betide poor Catherine!  I recommend you to talk\r\na little with his sister; it\xe2\x80\x99s a pity Catherine can\xe2\x80\x99t marry _her_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman had no appetite whatever for conversation with Mrs.\r\nMontgomery, whose acquaintance she made no trouble to cultivate; and the\r\neffect of this alarming forecast of her niece\xe2\x80\x99s destiny was to make her\r\nthink it indeed a thousand pities that Mr. Townsend\xe2\x80\x99s generous nature\r\nshould be embittered.  Bright enjoyment was his natural element, and how\r\ncould he be comfortable if there should prove to be nothing to enjoy?  It\r\nbecame a fixed idea with Mrs. Penniman that he should yet enjoy her\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s fortune, on which she had acuteness enough to perceive that her\r\nown claim was small.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t leave it to Catherine, it certainly won\xe2\x80\x99t be to leave it\r\nto me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Doctor, during the first six months he was abroad, never spoke to his\r\ndaughter of their little difference; partly on system, and partly because\r\nhe had a great many other things to think about.  It was idle to attempt\r\nto ascertain the state of her affections without direct inquiry, because,\r\nif she had not had an expressive manner among the familiar influences of\r\nhome, she failed to gather animation from the mountains of Switzerland or\r\nthe monuments of Italy.  She was always her father\xe2\x80\x99s docile and\r\nreasonable associate\xe2\x80\x94going through their sight-seeing in deferential\r\nsilence, never complaining of fatigue, always ready to start at the hour\r\nhe had appointed over-night, making no foolish criticisms and indulging\r\nin no refinements of appreciation.  \xe2\x80\x9cShe is about as intelligent as the\r\nbundle of shawls,\xe2\x80\x9d the Doctor said; her main superiority being that while\r\nthe bundle of shawls sometimes got lost, or tumbled out of the carriage,\r\nCatherine was always at her post, and had a firm and ample seat.  But her\r\nfather had expected this, and he was not constrained to set down her\r\nintellectual limitations as a tourist to sentimental depression; she had\r\ncompletely divested herself of the characteristics of a victim, and\r\nduring the whole time that they were abroad she never uttered an audible\r\nsigh.  He supposed she was in correspondence with Morris Townsend; but he\r\nheld his peace about it, for he never saw the young man\xe2\x80\x99s letters, and\r\nCatherine\xe2\x80\x99s own missives were always given to the courier to post.  She\r\nheard from her lover with considerable regularity, but his letters came\r\nenclosed in Mrs. Penniman\xe2\x80\x99s; so that whenever the Doctor handed her a\r\npacket addressed in his sister\xe2\x80\x99s hand, he was an involuntary instrument\r\nof the passion he condemned.  Catherine made this reflexion, and six\r\nmonths earlier she would have felt bound to give him warning; but now she\r\ndeemed herself absolved.  There was a sore spot in her heart that his own\r\nwords had made when once she spoke to him as she thought honour prompted;\r\nshe would try and please him as far as she could, but she would never\r\nspeak that way again.  She read her lover\xe2\x80\x99s letters in secret.\r\n\r\nOne day at the end of the summer, the two travellers found themselves in\r\na lonely valley of the Alps.  They were crossing one of the passes, and\r\non the long ascent they had got out of the carriage and had wandered much\r\nin advance.  After a while the Doctor descried a footpath which, leading\r\nthrough a transverse valley, would bring them out, as he justly supposed,\r\nat a much higher point of the ascent.  They followed this devious way,\r\nand finally lost the path; the valley proved very wild and rough, and\r\ntheir walk became rather a scramble.  They were good walkers, however,\r\nand they took their adventure easily; from time to time they stopped,\r\nthat Catherine might rest; and then she sat upon a stone and looked about\r\nher at the hard-featured rocks and the glowing sky.  It was late in the\r\nafternoon, in the last of August; night was coming on, and, as they had\r\nreached a great elevation, the air was cold and sharp.  In the west there\r\nwas a great suffusion of cold, red light, which made the sides of the\r\nlittle valley look only the more rugged and dusky.  During one of their\r\npauses, her father left her and wandered away to some high place, at a\r\ndistance, to get a view.  He was out of sight; she sat there alone, in\r\nthe stillness, which was just touched by the vague murmur, somewhere, of\r\na mountain brook.  She thought of Morris Townsend, and the place was so\r\ndesolate and lonely that he seemed very far away.  Her father remained\r\nabsent a long time; she began to wonder what had become of him.  But at\r\nlast he reappeared, coming towards her in the clear twilight, and she got\r\nup, to go on.  He made no motion to proceed, however, but came close to\r\nher, as if he had something to say.  He stopped in front of her and stood\r\nlooking at her, with eyes that had kept the light of the flushing\r\nsnow-summits on which they had just been fixed.  Then, abruptly, in a low\r\ntone, he asked her an unexpected question:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you given him up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question was unexpected, but Catherine was only superficially\r\nunprepared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, father!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her again for some moments, without speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he write to you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94about twice a month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor looked up and down the valley, swinging his stick; then he\r\nsaid to her, in the same low tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very angry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wondered what he meant\xe2\x80\x94whether he wished to frighten her.  If he did,\r\nthe place was well chosen; this hard, melancholy dell, abandoned by the\r\nsummer light, made her feel her loneliness.  She looked around her, and\r\nher heart grew cold; for a moment her fear was great.  But she could\r\nthink of nothing to say, save to murmur gently, \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou try my patience,\xe2\x80\x9d her father went on, \xe2\x80\x9cand you ought to know what I\r\nam, I am not a very good man.  Though I am very smooth externally, at\r\nbottom I am very passionate; and I assure you I can be very hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could not think why he told her these things.  Had he brought her\r\nthere on purpose, and was it part of a plan?  What was the plan?\r\nCatherine asked herself.  Was it to startle her suddenly into a\r\nretractation\xe2\x80\x94to take an advantage of her by dread?  Dread of what?  The\r\nplace was ugly and lonely, but the place could do her no harm.  There was\r\na kind of still intensity about her father, which made him dangerous, but\r\nCatherine hardly went so far as to say to herself that it might be part\r\nof his plan to fasten his hand\xe2\x80\x94the neat, fine, supple hand of a\r\ndistinguished physician\xe2\x80\x94in her throat.  Nevertheless, she receded a step.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure you can be anything you please,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.  And it was her\r\nsimple belief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very angry,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, more sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy has it taken you so suddenly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has not taken me suddenly.  I have been raging inwardly for the last\r\nsix months.  But just now this seemed a good place to flare out.  It\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\nquiet, and we are alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s very quiet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine vaguely, looking about her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you come back to the carriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a moment.  Do you mean that in all this time you have not yielded an\r\ninch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would if I could, father; but I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor looked round him too.  \xe2\x80\x9cShould you like to be left in such a\r\nplace as this, to starve?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will be your fate\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s how he will leave you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe would not touch her, but he had touched Morris.  The warmth came back\r\nto her heart.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat is not true, father,\xe2\x80\x9d she broke out, \xe2\x80\x9cand you ought\r\nnot to say it!  It is not right, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not true!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head slowly.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s not right, because you won\xe2\x80\x99t believe\r\nit.  But it _is_ true.  Come back to the carriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned away, and she followed him; he went faster, and was presently\r\nmuch in advance.  But from time to time he stopped, without turning\r\nround, to let her keep up with him, and she made her way forward with\r\ndifficulty, her heart beating with the excitement of having for the first\r\ntime spoken to him in violence.  By this time it had grown almost dark,\r\nand she ended by losing sight of him.  But she kept her course, and after\r\na little, the valley making a sudden turn, she gained the road, where the\r\ncarriage stood waiting.  In it sat her father, rigid and silent; in\r\nsilence, too, she took her place beside him.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her, later, in looking back upon all this, that for days\r\nafterwards not a word had been exchanged between them.  The scene had\r\nbeen a strange one, but it had not permanently affected her feeling\r\ntowards her father, for it was natural, after all, that he should\r\noccasionally make a scene of some kind, and he had let her alone for six\r\nmonths.  The strangest part of it was that he had said he was not a good\r\nman; Catherine wondered a great deal what he had meant by that.  The\r\nstatement failed to appeal to her credence, and it was not grateful to\r\nany resentment that she entertained.  Even in the utmost bitterness that\r\nshe might feel, it would give her no satisfaction to think him less\r\ncomplete.  Such a saying as that was a part of his great subtlety\xe2\x80\x94men so\r\nclever as he might say anything and mean anything.  And as to his being\r\nhard, that surely, in a man, was a virtue.\r\n\r\nHe let her alone for six months more\xe2\x80\x94six months during which she\r\naccommodated herself without a protest to the extension of their tour.\r\nBut he spoke again at the end of this time; it was at the very last, the\r\nnight before they embarked for New York, in the hotel at Liverpool.  They\r\nhad been dining together in a great dim, musty sitting-room; and then the\r\ncloth had been removed, and the Doctor walked slowly up and down.\r\nCatherine at last took her candle to go to bed, but her father motioned\r\nher to stay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean to do when you get home?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, while she stood\r\nthere with her candle in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean about Mr. Townsend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout Mr. Townsend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall probably marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor took several turns again while she waited.  \xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear from\r\nhim as much as ever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; twice a month,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine promptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd does he always talk about marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes!  That is, he talks about other things too, but he always says\r\nsomething about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to hear he varies his subjects; his letters might otherwise be\r\nmonotonous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe writes beautifully,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine, who was very glad of a chance to\r\nsay it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey always write beautifully.  However, in a given case that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndiminish the merit.  So, as soon as you arrive, you are going off with\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis seemed a rather gross way of putting it, and something that there\r\nwas of dignity in Catherine resented it.  \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell you till we\r\narrive,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable enough,\xe2\x80\x9d her father answered.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all I ask of\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94that you _do_ tell me, that you give me definite notice.  When a poor\r\nman is to lose his only child, he likes to have an inkling of it\r\nbeforehand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, father, you will not lose me!\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine said, spilling her\r\ncandle-wax.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree days before will do,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cif you are in a position to be\r\npositive then.  He ought to be very thankful to me, do you know.  I have\r\ndone a mighty good thing for him in taking you abroad; your value is\r\ntwice as great, with all the knowledge and taste that you have acquired.\r\nA year ago, you were perhaps a little limited\xe2\x80\x94a little rustic; but now\r\nyou have seen everything, and appreciated everything, and you will be a\r\nmost entertaining companion.  We have fattened the sheep for him before\r\nhe kills it!\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine turned away, and stood staring at the blank door.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to bed,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father; \xe2\x80\x9cand, as we don\xe2\x80\x99t go aboard till noon, you\r\nmay sleep late.  We shall probably have a most uncomfortable voyage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE voyage was indeed uncomfortable, and Catherine, on arriving in New\r\nYork, had not the compensation of \xe2\x80\x9cgoing off,\xe2\x80\x9d in her father\xe2\x80\x99s phrase,\r\nwith Morris Townsend.  She saw him, however, the day after she landed;\r\nand, in the meantime, he formed a natural subject of conversation between\r\nour heroine and her Aunt Lavinia, with whom, the night she disembarked,\r\nthe girl was closeted for a long time before either lady retired to rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen a great deal of him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe is not very\r\neasy to know.  I suppose you think you know him; but you don\xe2\x80\x99t, my dear.\r\nYou will some day; but it will only be after you have lived with him.  I\r\nmay almost say _I_ have lived with him,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Penniman proceeded, while\r\nCatherine stared.  \xe2\x80\x9cI think I know him now; I have had such remarkable\r\nopportunities.  You will have the same\xe2\x80\x94or rather, you will have better!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand Aunt Lavinia smiled.  \xe2\x80\x9cThen you will see what I mean.  It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nwonderful character, full of passion and energy, and just as true!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine listened with a mixture of interest and apprehension.  Aunt\r\nLavinia was intensely sympathetic, and Catherine, for the past year,\r\nwhile she wandered through foreign galleries and churches, and rolled\r\nover the smoothness of posting roads, nursing the thoughts that never\r\npassed her lips, had often longed for the company of some intelligent\r\nperson of her own sex.  To tell her story to some kind woman\xe2\x80\x94at moments\r\nit seemed to her that this would give her comfort, and she had more than\r\nonce been on the point of taking the landlady, or the nice young person\r\nfrom the dressmaker\xe2\x80\x99s, into her confidence.  If a woman had been near her\r\nshe would on certain occasions have treated such a companion to a fit of\r\nweeping; and she had an apprehension that, on her return, this would form\r\nher response to Aunt Lavinia\xe2\x80\x99s first embrace.  In fact, however, the two\r\nladies had met, in Washington Square, without tears, and when they found\r\nthemselves alone together a certain dryness fell upon the girl\xe2\x80\x99s emotion.\r\nIt came over her with a greater force that Mrs. Penniman had enjoyed a\r\nwhole year of her lover\xe2\x80\x99s society, and it was not a pleasure to her to\r\nhear her aunt explain and interpret the young man, speaking of him as if\r\nher own knowledge of him were supreme.  It was not that Catherine was\r\njealous; but her sense of Mrs. Penniman\xe2\x80\x99s innocent falsity, which had\r\nlain dormant, began to haunt her again, and she was glad that she was\r\nsafely at home.  With this, however, it was a blessing to be able to talk\r\nof Morris, to sound his name, to be with a person who was not unjust to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been very kind to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe has written me\r\nthat, often.  I shall never forget that, Aunt Lavinia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have done what I could; it has been very little.  To let him come and\r\ntalk to me, and give him his cup of tea\xe2\x80\x94that was all.  Your Aunt Almond\r\nthought it was too much, and used to scold me terribly; but she promised\r\nme, at least, not to betray me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo betray you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to tell your father.  He used to sit in your father\xe2\x80\x99s study!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Penniman, with a little laugh.\r\n\r\nCatherine was silent a moment.  This idea was disagreeable to her, and\r\nshe was reminded again, with pain, of her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s secretive habits.\r\nMorris, the reader may be informed, had had the tact not to tell her that\r\nhe sat in her father\xe2\x80\x99s study.  He had known her but for a few months, and\r\nher aunt had known her for fifteen years; and yet he would not have made\r\nthe mistake of thinking that Catherine would see the joke of the thing.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry you made him go into father\xe2\x80\x99s room,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, after a while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t make him go; he went himself.  He liked to look at the books,\r\nand all those things in the glass cases.  He knows all about them; he\r\nknows all about everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine was silent again; then, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish he had found some employment,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has found some employment!  It\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful news, and he told me to\r\ntell you as soon as you arrived.  He has gone into partnership with a\r\ncommission merchant.  It was all settled, quite suddenly, a week ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis seemed to Catherine indeed beautiful news; it had a fine prosperous\r\nair.  \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad!\xe2\x80\x9d she said; and now, for a moment, she was\r\ndisposed to throw herself on Aunt Lavinia\xe2\x80\x99s neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s much better than being under some one; and he has never been used\r\nto that,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Penniman went on.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe is just as good as his partner\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nare perfectly equal!  You see how right he was to wait.  I should like to\r\nknow what your father can say now!  They have got an office in Duane\r\nStreet, and little printed cards; he brought me one to show me.  I have\r\ngot it in my room, and you shall see it to-morrow.  That\xe2\x80\x99s what he said\r\nto me the last time he was here\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98You see how right I was to wait!\xe2\x80\x99  He\r\nhas got other people under him, instead of being a subordinate.  He could\r\nnever be a subordinate; I have often told him I could never think of him\r\nin that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine assented to this proposition, and was very happy to know that\r\nMorris was his own master; but she was deprived of the satisfaction of\r\nthinking that she might communicate this news in triumph to her father.\r\nHer father would care equally little whether Morris were established in\r\nbusiness or transported for life.  Her trunks had been brought into her\r\nroom, and further reference to her lover was for a short time suspended,\r\nwhile she opened them and displayed to her aunt some of the spoils of\r\nforeign travel.  These were rich and abundant; and Catherine had brought\r\nhome a present to every one\xe2\x80\x94to every one save Morris, to whom she had\r\nbrought simply her undiverted heart.  To Mrs. Penniman she had been\r\nlavishly generous, and Aunt Lavinia spent half an hour in unfolding and\r\nfolding again, with little ejaculations of gratitude and taste.  She\r\nmarched about for some time in a splendid cashmere shawl, which Catherine\r\nhad begged her to accept, settling it on her shoulders, and twisting down\r\nher head to see how low the point descended behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall regard it only as a loan,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.  \xe2\x80\x9cI will leave it to you\r\nagain when I die; or rather,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, kissing her niece again, \xe2\x80\x9cI will\r\nleave it to your first-born little girl!\xe2\x80\x9d  And draped in her shawl, she\r\nstood there smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better wait till she comes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like the way you say that,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Penniman rejoined, in a moment.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatherine, are you changed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I am the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not swerved a line?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am exactly the same,\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine repeated, wishing her aunt were a\r\nlittle less sympathetic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am glad!\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs. Penniman surveyed her cashmere in the glass.\r\nThen, \xe2\x80\x9cHow is your father?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked in a moment, with her eyes on her\r\nniece.  \xe2\x80\x9cYour letters were so meagre\xe2\x80\x94I could never tell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather is very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you know what I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman, with a dignity to which\r\nthe cashmere gave a richer effect.  \xe2\x80\x9cIs he still implacable!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite unchanged?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is, if possible, more firm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman took off her great shawl, and slowly folded it up.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nis very bad.  You had no success with your little project?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat little project?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMorris told me all about it.  The idea of turning the tables on him, in\r\nEurope; of watching him, when he was agreeably impressed by some\r\ncelebrated sight\xe2\x80\x94he pretends to be so artistic, you know\xe2\x80\x94and then just\r\npleading with him and bringing him round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never tried it.  It was Morris\xe2\x80\x99s idea; but if he had been with us, in\r\nEurope, he would have seen that father was never impressed in that way.\r\nHe _is_ artistic\xe2\x80\x94tremendously artistic; but the more celebrated places we\r\nvisited, and the more he admired them, the less use it would have been to\r\nplead with him.  They seemed only to make him more determined\xe2\x80\x94more\r\nterrible,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Catherine.  \xe2\x80\x9cI shall never bring him round, and I\r\nexpect nothing now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I must say,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Penniman answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI never supposed you were\r\ngoing to give it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have given it up.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t care now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have grown very brave,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman, with a short laugh.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t advise you to sacrifice your property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am braver than I was.  You asked me if I had changed; I have\r\nchanged in that way.  Oh,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI have changed very much.\r\nAnd it isn\xe2\x80\x99t my property.  If _he_ doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care for it, why should I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman hesitated.  \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he does care for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe cares for it for my sake, because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to injure me.  But\r\nhe will know\xe2\x80\x94he knows already\xe2\x80\x94how little he need be afraid about that.\r\nBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine, \xe2\x80\x9cI have got plenty of money of my own.  We\r\nshall be very well off; and now hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he got his business?  I am\r\ndelighted about that business.\xe2\x80\x9d  She went on talking, showing a good deal\r\nof excitement as she proceeded.  Her aunt had never seen her with just\r\nthis manner, and Mrs. Penniman, observing her, set it down to foreign\r\ntravel, which had made her more positive, more mature.  She thought also\r\nthat Catherine had improved in appearance; she looked rather handsome.\r\nMrs. Penniman wondered whether Morris Townsend would be struck with that.\r\nWhile she was engaged in this speculation, Catherine broke out, with a\r\ncertain sharpness, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you so contradictory, Aunt Penniman?  You\r\nseem to think one thing at one time, and another at another.  A year ago,\r\nbefore I went away, you wished me not to mind about displeasing father;\r\nand now you seem to recommend me to take another line.  You change about\r\nso.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis attack was unexpected, for Mrs. Penniman was not used, in any\r\ndiscussion, to seeing the war carried into her own country\xe2\x80\x94possibly\r\nbecause the enemy generally had doubts of finding subsistence there.  To\r\nher own consciousness, the flowery fields of her reason had rarely been\r\nravaged by a hostile force.  It was perhaps on this account that in\r\ndefending them she was majestic rather than agile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you accuse me of, save of being too deeply interested\r\nin your happiness.  It is the first time I have been told I am\r\ncapricious.  That fault is not what I am usually reproached with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were angry last year that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t marry immediately, and now you\r\ntalk about my winning my father over.  You told me it would serve him\r\nright if he should take me to Europe for nothing.  Well, he has taken me\r\nfor nothing, and you ought to be satisfied.  Nothing is changed\xe2\x80\x94nothing\r\nbut my feeling about father.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind nearly so much now.  I have\r\nbeen as good as I could, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care.  Now I don\xe2\x80\x99t care either.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether I have grown bad; perhaps I have.  But I don\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\nfor that.  I have come home to be married\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all I know.  That ought\r\nto please you, unless you have taken up some new idea; you are so\r\nstrange.  You may do as you please; but you must never speak to me again\r\nabout pleading with father.  I shall never plead with him for anything;\r\nthat is all over.  He has put me off.  I am come home to be married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a more authoritative speech than she had ever heard on her\r\nniece\xe2\x80\x99s lips, and Mrs. Penniman was proportionately startled.  She was\r\nindeed a little awestruck, and the force of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s emotion and\r\nresolution left her nothing to reply.  She was easily frightened, and she\r\nalways carried off her discomfiture by a concession; a concession which\r\nwas often accompanied, as in the present case, by a little nervous laugh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nIF she had disturbed her niece\xe2\x80\x99s temper\xe2\x80\x94she began from this moment\r\nforward to talk a good deal about Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s temper, an article which up\r\nto that time had never been mentioned in connexion with our\r\nheroine\xe2\x80\x94Catherine had opportunity, on the morrow, to recover her\r\nserenity.  Mrs. Penniman had given her a message from Morris Townsend, to\r\nthe effect that he would come and welcome her home on the day after her\r\narrival.  He came in the afternoon; but, as may be imagined, he was not\r\non this occasion made free of Dr. Sloper\xe2\x80\x99s study.  He had been coming and\r\ngoing, for the past year, so comfortably and irresponsibly, that he had a\r\ncertain sense of being wronged by finding himself reminded that he must\r\nnow limit his horizon to the front parlour, which was Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nparticular province.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad you have come back,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cit makes me very happy to\r\nsee you again.\xe2\x80\x9d  And he looked at her, smiling, from head to foot; though\r\nit did not appear, afterwards, that he agreed with Mrs. Penniman (who,\r\nwomanlike, went more into details) in thinking her embellished.\r\n\r\nTo Catherine he appeared resplendent; it was some time before she could\r\nbelieve again that this beautiful young man was her own exclusive\r\nproperty.  They had a great deal of characteristic lovers\xe2\x80\x99 talk\xe2\x80\x94a soft\r\nexchange of inquiries and assurances.  In these matters Morris had an\r\nexcellent grace, which flung a picturesque interest even over the account\r\nof his d\xc3\xa9but in the commission business\xe2\x80\x94a subject as to which his\r\ncompanion earnestly questioned him.  From time to time he got up from the\r\nsofa where they sat together, and walked about the room; after which he\r\ncame back, smiling and passing his hand through his hair.  He was\r\nunquiet, as was natural in a young man who has just been reunited to a\r\nlong-absent mistress, and Catherine made the reflexion that she had never\r\nseen him so excited.  It gave her pleasure, somehow, to note this fact.\r\nHe asked her questions about her travels, to some of which she was unable\r\nto reply, for she had forgotten the names of places, and the order of her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s journey.  But for the moment she was so happy, so lifted up by\r\nthe belief that her troubles at last were over, that she forgot to be\r\nashamed of her meagre answers.  It seemed to her now that she could marry\r\nhim without the remnant of a scruple or a single tremor save those that\r\nbelonged to joy.  Without waiting for him to ask, she told him that her\r\nfather had come back in exactly the same state of mind\xe2\x80\x94that he had not\r\nyielded an inch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must not expect it now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand we must do without it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris sat looking and smiling.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy poor dear girl!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t pity me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it now\xe2\x80\x94I am used to\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris continued to smile, and then he got up and walked about again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better let me try him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry to bring him over?  You would only make him worse,\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine\r\nanswered resolutely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say that because I managed it so badly before.  But I should manage\r\nit differently now.  I am much wiser; I have had a year to think of it.\r\nI have more tact.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that what you have been thinking of for a year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch of the time.  You see, the idea sticks in my crop.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to\r\nbe beaten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you beaten if we marry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I am not beaten on the main issue; but I am, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see,\r\non all the rest of it\xe2\x80\x94on the question of my reputation, of my relations\r\nwith your father, of my relations with my own children, if we should have\r\nany.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have enough for our children\xe2\x80\x94we shall have enough for\r\neverything.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t you expect to succeed in business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrilliantly, and we shall certainly be very comfortable.  But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nof the mere material comfort I speak; it is of the moral comfort,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMorris\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cof the intellectual satisfaction!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have great moral comfort now,\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine declared, very simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you have.  But with me it is different.  I have staked my\r\npride on proving to your father that he is wrong; and now that I am at\r\nthe head of a flourishing business, I can deal with him as an equal.  I\r\nhave a capital plan\xe2\x80\x94do let me go at him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood before her with his bright face, his jaunty air, his hands in\r\nhis pockets; and she got up, with her eyes resting on his own.  \xe2\x80\x9cPlease\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t, Morris; please don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; and there was a certain mild, sad\r\nfirmness in her tone which he heard for the first time.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe must ask no\r\nfavours of him\xe2\x80\x94we must ask nothing more.  He won\xe2\x80\x99t relent, and nothing\r\ngood will come of it.  I know it now\xe2\x80\x94I have a very good reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray; what is your reason?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated to bring it out, but at last it came.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe is not very fond\r\nof me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, bother!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Morris angrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say such a thing without being sure.  I saw it, I felt it, in\r\nEngland, just before he came away.  He talked to me one night\xe2\x80\x94the last\r\nnight; and then it came over me.  You can tell when a person feels that\r\nway.  I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t accuse him if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t made me feel that way.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\naccuse him; I just tell you that that\xe2\x80\x99s how it is.  He can\xe2\x80\x99t help it; we\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t govern our affections.  Do I govern mine? mightn\xe2\x80\x99t he say that to\r\nme?  It\xe2\x80\x99s because he is so fond of my mother, whom we lost so long ago.\r\nShe was beautiful, and very, very brilliant; he is always thinking of\r\nher.  I am not at all like her; Aunt Penniman has told me that.  Of\r\ncourse, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t my fault; but neither is it his fault.  All I mean is,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s true; and it\xe2\x80\x99s a stronger reason for his never being reconciled than\r\nsimply his dislike for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Simply?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d cried Morris, with a laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cI am much obliged for that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind about his disliking you now; I mind everything less.  I\r\nfeel differently; I feel separated from my father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are a queer family!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say that\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything unkind,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl entreated.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmust be very kind to me now, because, Morris\xe2\x80\x94because,\xe2\x80\x9d and she hesitated\r\na moment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbecause I have done a great deal for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know that, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had spoken up to this moment without vehemence or outward sign of\r\nemotion, gently, reasoningly, only trying to explain.  But her emotion\r\nhad been ineffectually smothered, and it betrayed itself at last in the\r\ntrembling of her voice.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a great thing to be separated like that\r\nfrom your father, when you have worshipped him before.  It has made me\r\nvery unhappy; or it would have made me so if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t love you.  You can\r\ntell when a person speaks to you as if\xe2\x80\x94as if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs if what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs if they despised you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine passionately.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe spoke that\r\nway the night before we sailed.  It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much, but it was enough, and I\r\nthought of it on the voyage, all the time.  Then I made up my mind.  I\r\nwill never ask him for anything again, or expect anything from him.  It\r\nwould not be natural now.  We must be very happy together, and we must\r\nnot seem to depend upon his forgiveness.  And Morris, Morris, you must\r\nnever despise me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was an easy promise to make, and Morris made it with fine effect.\r\nBut for the moment he undertook nothing more onerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Doctor, of course, on his return, had a good deal of talk with his\r\nsisters.  He was at no great pains to narrate his travels or to\r\ncommunicate his impressions of distant lands to Mrs. Penniman, upon whom\r\nhe contented himself with bestowing a memento of his enviable experience,\r\nin the shape of a velvet gown.  But he conversed with her at some length\r\nabout matters nearer home, and lost no time in assuring her that he was\r\nstill an inflexible father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt you have seen a great deal of Mr. Townsend, and done\r\nyour best to console him for Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s absence,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t ask\r\nyou, and you needn\xe2\x80\x99t deny it.  I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put the question to you for the\r\nworld, and expose you to the inconvenience of having to\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94excogitate an\r\nanswer.  No one has betrayed you, and there has been no spy upon your\r\nproceedings.  Elizabeth has told no tales, and has never mentioned you\r\nexcept to praise your good looks and good spirits.  The thing is simply\r\nan inference of my own\xe2\x80\x94an induction, as the philosophers say.  It seems\r\nto me likely that you would have offered an asylum to an interesting\r\nsufferer.  Mr. Townsend has been a good deal in the house; there is\r\nsomething in the house that tells me so.  We doctors, you know, end by\r\nacquiring fine perceptions, and it is impressed upon my sensorium that he\r\nhas sat in these chairs, in a very easy attitude, and warmed himself at\r\nthat fire.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t grudge him the comfort of it; it is the only one he\r\nwill ever enjoy at my expense.  It seems likely, indeed, that I shall be\r\nable to economise at his own.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you may have said to\r\nhim, or what you may say hereafter; but I should like you to know that if\r\nyou have encouraged him to believe that he will gain anything by hanging\r\non, or that I have budged a hair\xe2\x80\x99s-breadth from the position I took up a\r\nyear ago, you have played him a trick for which he may exact reparation.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that he may not bring a suit against you.  Of course you\r\nhave done it conscientiously; you have made yourself believe that I can\r\nbe tired out.  This is the most baseless hallucination that ever visited\r\nthe brain of a genial optimist.  I am not in the least tired; I am as\r\nfresh as when I started; I am good for fifty years yet.  Catherine\r\nappears not to have budged an inch either; she is equally fresh; so we\r\nare about where we were before.  This, however, you know as well as I.\r\nWhat I wish is simply to give you notice of my own state of mind!  Take\r\nit to heart, dear Lavinia.  Beware of the just resentment of a deluded\r\nfortune-hunter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say I expected it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I had a sort of\r\nfoolish hope that you would come home without that odious ironical tone\r\nwith which you treat the most sacred subjects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t undervalue irony, it is often of great use.  It is not, however,\r\nalways necessary, and I will show you how gracefully I can lay it aside.\r\nI should like to know whether you think Morris Townsend will hang on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will answer you with your own weapons,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou had\r\nbetter wait and see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you call such a speech as that one of my own weapons?  I never said\r\nanything so rough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will hang on long enough to make you very uncomfortable, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Lavinia,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you call that irony?  I call\r\nit pugilism.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman, however, in spite of her pugilism, was a good deal\r\nfrightened, and she took counsel of her fears.  Her brother meanwhile\r\ntook counsel, with many reservations, of Mrs. Almond, to whom he was no\r\nless generous than to Lavinia, and a good deal more communicative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose she has had him there all the while,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \xe2\x80\x9cI must look\r\ninto the state of my wine!  You needn\xe2\x80\x99t mind telling me now; I have\r\nalready said all I mean to say to her on the subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe he was in the house a good deal,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Almond answered.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nyou must admit that your leaving Lavinia quite alone was a great change\r\nfor her, and that it was natural she should want some society.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do admit that, and that is why I shall make no row about the wine; I\r\nshall set it down as compensation to Lavinia.  She is capable of telling\r\nme that she drank it all herself.  Think of the inconceivable bad taste,\r\nin the circumstances, of that fellow making free with the house\xe2\x80\x94or coming\r\nthere at all!  If that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t describe him, he is indescribable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis plan is to get what he can.  Lavinia will have supported him for a\r\nyear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Almond.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so much gained.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will have to support him for the rest of his life, then!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the\r\nDoctor.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut without wine, as they say at the _tables d\xe2\x80\x99h\xc3\xb4te_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatherine tells me he has set up a business, and is making a great deal\r\nof money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor stared.  \xe2\x80\x9cShe has not told me that\xe2\x80\x94and Lavinia didn\xe2\x80\x99t deign.\r\nAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cCatherine has given me up.  Not that it matters, for all\r\nthat the business amounts to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has not given up Mr. Townsend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Almond.  \xe2\x80\x9cI saw that in\r\nthe first half minute.  She has come home exactly the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly the same; not a grain more intelligent.  She didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice a\r\nstick or a stone all the while we were away\xe2\x80\x94not a picture nor a view, not\r\na statue nor a cathedral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could she notice?  She had other things to think of; they are never\r\nfor an instant out of her mind.  She touches me very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe would touch me if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t irritate me.  That\xe2\x80\x99s the effect she has\r\nupon me now.  I have tried everything upon her; I really have been quite\r\nmerciless.  But it is of no use whatever; she is absolutely _glued_.  I\r\nhave passed, in consequence, into the exasperated stage.  At first I had\r\na good deal of a certain genial curiosity about it; I wanted to see if\r\nshe really would stick.  But, good Lord, one\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity is satisfied!  I\r\nsee she is capable of it, and now she can let go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will never let go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Almond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care, or you will exasperate me too.  If she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t let go, she\r\nwill be shaken off\xe2\x80\x94sent tumbling into the dust!  That\xe2\x80\x99s a nice position\r\nfor my daughter.  She can\xe2\x80\x99t see that if you are going to be pushed you\r\nhad better jump.  And then she will complain of her bruises.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will never complain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Almond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I shall object to even more.  But the deuce will be that I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nprevent anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she is to have a fall,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Almond, with a gentle laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\nmust spread as many carpets as we can.\xe2\x80\x9d  And she carried out this idea by\r\nshowing a great deal of motherly kindness to the girl.\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman immediately wrote to Morris Townsend.  The intimacy between\r\nthese two was by this time consummate, but I must content myself with\r\nnoting but a few of its features.  Mrs. Penniman\xe2\x80\x99s own share in it was a\r\nsingular sentiment, which might have been misinterpreted, but which in\r\nitself was not discreditable to the poor lady.  It was a romantic\r\ninterest in this attractive and unfortunate young man, and yet it was not\r\nsuch an interest as Catherine might have been jealous of.  Mrs. Penniman\r\nhad not a particle of jealousy of her niece.  For herself, she felt as if\r\nshe were Morris\xe2\x80\x99s mother or sister\xe2\x80\x94a mother or sister of an emotional\r\ntemperament\xe2\x80\x94and she had an absorbing desire to make him comfortable and\r\nhappy.  She had striven to do so during the year that her brother left\r\nher an open field, and her efforts had been attended with the success\r\nthat has been pointed out.  She had never had a child of her own, and\r\nCatherine, whom she had done her best to invest with the importance that\r\nwould naturally belong to a youthful Penniman, had only partly rewarded\r\nher zeal.  Catherine, as an object of affection and solicitude, had never\r\nhad that picturesque charm which (as it seemed to her) would have been a\r\nnatural attribute of her own progeny.  Even the maternal passion in Mrs.\r\nPenniman would have been romantic and factitious, and Catherine was not\r\nconstituted to inspire a romantic passion.  Mrs. Penniman was as fond of\r\nher as ever, but she had grown to feel that with Catherine she lacked\r\nopportunity.  Sentimentally speaking, therefore, she had (though she had\r\nnot disinherited her niece) adopted Morris Townsend, who gave her\r\nopportunity in abundance.  She would have been very happy to have a\r\nhandsome and tyrannical son, and would have taken an extreme interest in\r\nhis love affairs.  This was the light in which she had come to regard\r\nMorris, who had conciliated her at first, and made his impression by his\r\ndelicate and calculated deference\xe2\x80\x94a sort of exhibition to which Mrs.\r\nPenniman was particularly sensitive.  He had largely abated his deference\r\nafterwards, for he economised his resources, but the impression was made,\r\nand the young man\xe2\x80\x99s very brutality came to have a sort of filial value.\r\nIf Mrs. Penniman had had a son, she would probably have been afraid of\r\nhim, and at this stage of our narrative she was certainly afraid of\r\nMorris Townsend.  This was one of the results of his domestication in\r\nWashington Square.  He took his ease with her\xe2\x80\x94as, for that matter, he\r\nwould certainly have done with his own mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE letter was a word of warning; it informed him that the Doctor had\r\ncome home more impracticable than ever.  She might have reflected that\r\nCatherine would supply him with all the information he needed on this\r\npoint; but we know that Mrs. Penniman\xe2\x80\x99s reflexions were rarely just; and,\r\nmoreover, she felt that it was not for her to depend on what Catherine\r\nmight do.  She was to do her duty, quite irrespective of Catherine.  I\r\nhave said that her young friend took his ease with her, and it is an\r\nillustration of the fact that he made no answer to her letter.  He took\r\nnote of it, amply; but he lighted his cigar with it, and he waited, in\r\ntranquil confidence that he should receive another.  \xe2\x80\x9cHis state of mind\r\nreally freezes my blood,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Penniman had written, alluding to her\r\nbrother; and it would have seemed that upon this statement she could\r\nhardly improve.  Nevertheless, she wrote again, expressing herself with\r\nthe aid of a different figure.  \xe2\x80\x9cHis hatred of you burns with a lurid\r\nflame\xe2\x80\x94the flame that never dies,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t light up\r\nthe darkness of your future.  If my affection could do so, all the years\r\nof your life would be an eternal sunshine.  I can extract nothing from\r\nC.; she is so terribly secretive, like her father.  She seems to expect\r\nto be married very soon, and has evidently made preparations in\r\nEurope\xe2\x80\x94quantities of clothing, ten pairs of shoes, etc.  My dear friend,\r\nyou cannot set up in married life simply with a few pairs of shoes, can\r\nyou?  Tell me what you think of this.  I am intensely anxious to see you;\r\nI have so much to say.  I miss you dreadfully; the house seems so empty\r\nwithout you.  What is the news down town?  Is the business extending?\r\nThat dear little business\xe2\x80\x94I think it\xe2\x80\x99s so brave of you!  Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t I come\r\nto your office?\xe2\x80\x94just for three minutes?  I might pass for a customer\xe2\x80\x94is\r\nthat what you call them?  I might come in to buy something\xe2\x80\x94some shares or\r\nsome railroad things.  _Tell me what you think of this plan_.  I would\r\ncarry a little reticule, like a woman of the people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of the suggestion about the reticule, Morris appeared to think\r\npoorly of the plan, for he gave Mrs. Penniman no encouragement whatever\r\nto visit his office, which he had already represented to her as a place\r\npeculiarly and unnaturally difficult to find.  But as she persisted in\r\ndesiring an interview\xe2\x80\x94up to the last, after months of intimate colloquy,\r\nshe called these meetings \xe2\x80\x9cinterviews\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he agreed that they should take a\r\nwalk together, and was even kind enough to leave his office for this\r\npurpose, during the hours at which business might have been supposed to\r\nbe liveliest.  It was no surprise to him, when they met at a street\r\ncorner, in a region of empty lots and undeveloped pavements (Mrs.\r\nPenniman being attired as much as possible like a \xe2\x80\x9cwoman of the people\xe2\x80\x9d),\r\nto find that, in spite of her urgency, what she chiefly had to convey to\r\nhim was the assurance of her sympathy.  Of such assurances, however, he\r\nhad already a voluminous collection, and it would not have been worth his\r\nwhile to forsake a fruitful avocation merely to hear Mrs. Penniman say,\r\nfor the thousandth time, that she had made his cause her own.  Morris had\r\nsomething of his own to say.  It was not an easy thing to bring out, and\r\nwhile he turned it over the difficulty made him acrimonious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I know perfectly that he combines the properties of a lump of\r\nice and a red-hot coal,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed.  \xe2\x80\x9cCatherine has made it thoroughly\r\nclear, and you have told me so till I am sick of it.  You needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me\r\nagain; I am perfectly satisfied.  He will never give us a penny; I regard\r\nthat as mathematically proved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman at this point had an inspiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you bring a lawsuit against him?\xe2\x80\x9d  She wondered that this\r\nsimple expedient had never occurred to her before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will bring a lawsuit against _you_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris, \xe2\x80\x9cif you ask me any\r\nmore such aggravating questions.  A man should know when he is beaten,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe added, in a moment.  \xe2\x80\x9cI must give her up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman received this declaration in silence, though it made her\r\nheart beat a little.  It found her by no means unprepared, for she had\r\naccustomed herself to the thought that, if Morris should decidedly not be\r\nable to get her brother\xe2\x80\x99s money, it would not do for him to marry\r\nCatherine without it.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt would not do\xe2\x80\x9d was a vague way of putting the\r\nthing; but Mrs. Penniman\xe2\x80\x99s natural affection completed the idea, which,\r\nthough it had not as yet been so crudely expressed between them as in the\r\nform that Morris had just given it, had nevertheless been implied so\r\noften, in certain easy intervals of talk, as he sat stretching his legs\r\nin the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s well-stuffed armchairs, that she had grown first to\r\nregard it with an emotion which she flattered herself was philosophic,\r\nand then to have a secret tenderness for it.  The fact that she kept her\r\ntenderness secret proves, of course, that she was ashamed of it; but she\r\nmanaged to blink her shame by reminding herself that she was, after all,\r\nthe official protector of her niece\xe2\x80\x99s marriage.  Her logic would scarcely\r\nhave passed muster with the Doctor.  In the first place, Morris _must_\r\nget the money, and she would help him to it.  In the second, it was plain\r\nit would never come to him, and it would be a grievous pity he should\r\nmarry without it\xe2\x80\x94a young man who might so easily find something better.\r\nAfter her brother had delivered himself, on his return from Europe, of\r\nthat incisive little address that has been quoted, Morris\xe2\x80\x99s cause seemed\r\nso hopeless that Mrs. Penniman fixed her attention exclusively upon the\r\nlatter branch of her argument.  If Morris had been her son, she would\r\ncertainly have sacrificed Catherine to a superior conception of his\r\nfuture; and to be ready to do so as the case stood was therefore even a\r\nfiner degree of devotion.  Nevertheless, it checked her breath a little\r\nto have the sacrificial knife, as it were, suddenly thrust into her hand.\r\n\r\nMorris walked along a moment, and then he repeated harshly: \xe2\x80\x9cI must give\r\nher up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly say it distinctly enough\xe2\x80\x94brutally and vulgarly enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was ashamed of himself, and his shame was uncomfortable; and as he was\r\nextremely intolerant of discomfort, he felt vicious and cruel.  He wanted\r\nto abuse somebody, and he began, cautiously\xe2\x80\x94for he was always\r\ncautious\xe2\x80\x94with himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you take her down a little?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake her down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrepare her\xe2\x80\x94try and ease me off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman stopped, looking at him very solemnly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor Morris, do you know how much she loves you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know.  I have always tried to keep from\r\nknowing.  It would be too painful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will suffer much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must console her.  If you are as good a friend to me as you pretend\r\nto be, you will manage it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman shook her head sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talk of my \xe2\x80\x98pretending\xe2\x80\x99 to like you; but I can\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to hate\r\nyou.  I can only tell her I think very highly of you; and how will that\r\nconsole her for losing you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Doctor will help you.  He will be delighted at the thing being\r\nbroken off, and, as he is a knowing fellow, he will invent something to\r\ncomfort her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will invent a new torture!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Penniman.  \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven deliver her\r\nfrom her father\xe2\x80\x99s comfort.  It will consist of his crowing over her and\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x98I always told you so!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris coloured a most uncomfortable red.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t console her any better than you console me, you certainly\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be of much use!  It\xe2\x80\x99s a damned disagreeable necessity; I feel it\r\nextremely, and you ought to make it easy for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will be your friend for life!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Penniman declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe my friend _now_!\xe2\x80\x9d  And Morris walked on.\r\n\r\nShe went with him; she was almost trembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you like me to tell her?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t tell her, but\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x94you can\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d  And he hesitated, trying to think what Mrs. Penniman\r\ncould do.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou can explain to her why it is.  It\xe2\x80\x99s because I can\xe2\x80\x99t bring\r\nmyself to step in between her and her father\xe2\x80\x94to give him the pretext he\r\ngrasps at\xe2\x80\x94so eagerly (it\xe2\x80\x99s a hideous sight) for depriving her of her\r\nrights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman felt with remarkable promptitude the charm of this formula.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so like you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s so finely felt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris gave his stick an angry swing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, botheration!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed perversely.\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman, however, was not discouraged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may turn out better than you think.  Catherine is, after all, so very\r\npeculiar.\xe2\x80\x9d  And she thought she might take it upon herself to assure him\r\nthat, whatever happened, the girl would be very quiet\xe2\x80\x94she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make a\r\nnoise.  They extended their walk, and, while they proceeded, Mrs.\r\nPenniman took upon herself other things besides, and ended by having\r\nassumed a considerable burden; Morris being ready enough, as may be\r\nimagined, to put everything off upon her.  But he was not for a single\r\ninstant the dupe of her blundering alacrity; he knew that of what she\r\npromised she was competent to perform but an insignificant fraction, and\r\nthe more she professed her willingness to serve him, the greater fool he\r\nthought her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you do if you don\xe2\x80\x99t marry her?\xe2\x80\x9d she ventured to inquire in the\r\ncourse of this conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething brilliant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris.  \xe2\x80\x9cShouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like me to do\r\nsomething brilliant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe idea gave Mrs. Penniman exceeding pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall feel sadly taken in if you don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have to, to make up for this.  This isn\xe2\x80\x99t at all brilliant, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman mused a little, as if there might be some way of making out\r\nthat it was; but she had to give up the attempt, and, to carry off the\r\nawkwardness of failure, she risked a new inquiry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean\xe2\x80\x94do you mean another marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris greeted this question with a reflexion which was hardly the less\r\nimpudent from being inaudible.  \xe2\x80\x9cSurely, women are more crude than men!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd then he answered audibly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever in the world!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman felt disappointed and snubbed, and she relieved herself in\r\na little vaguely-sarcastic cry.  He was certainly perverse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give her up, not for another woman, but for a wider career!\xe2\x80\x9d Morris\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\nThis was very grand; but still Mrs. Penniman, who felt that she had\r\nexposed herself, was faintly rancorous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean never to come to see her again?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, with some\r\nsharpness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, I shall come again; but what is the use of dragging it out?  I\r\nhave been four times since she came back, and it\xe2\x80\x99s terribly awkward work.\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t keep it up indefinitely; she oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to expect that, you know.\r\nA woman should never keep a man dangling!\xe2\x80\x9d he added finely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but you must have your last parting!\xe2\x80\x9d urged his companion, in whose\r\nimagination the idea of last partings occupied a place inferior in\r\ndignity only to that of first meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nHE came again, without managing the last parting; and again and again,\r\nwithout finding that Mrs. Penniman had as yet done much to pave the path\r\nof retreat with flowers.  It was devilish awkward, as he said, and he\r\nfelt a lively animosity for Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s aunt, who, as he had now quite\r\nformed the habit of saying to himself, had dragged him into the mess and\r\nwas bound in common charity to get him out of it.  Mrs. Penniman, to tell\r\nthe truth, had, in the seclusion of her own apartment\xe2\x80\x94and, I may add,\r\namid the suggestiveness of Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s, which wore in those days the\r\nappearance of that of a young lady laying out her _trousseau_\xe2\x80\x94Mrs.\r\nPenniman had measured her responsibilities, and taken fright at their\r\nmagnitude.  The task of preparing Catherine and easing off Morris\r\npresented difficulties which increased in the execution, and even led the\r\nimpulsive Lavinia to ask herself whether the modification of the young\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s original project had been conceived in a happy spirit.  A brilliant\r\nfuture, a wider career, a conscience exempt from the reproach of\r\ninterference between a young lady and her natural rights\xe2\x80\x94these excellent\r\nthings might be too troublesomely purchased.  From Catherine herself Mrs.\r\nPenniman received no assistance whatever; the poor girl was apparently\r\nwithout suspicion of her danger.  She looked at her lover with eyes of\r\nundiminished trust, and though she had less confidence in her aunt than\r\nin a young man with whom she had exchanged so many tender vows, she gave\r\nher no handle for explaining or confessing.  Mrs. Penniman, faltering and\r\nwavering, declared Catherine was very stupid, put off the great scene, as\r\nshe would have called it, from day to day, and wandered about very\r\nuncomfortably, primed, to repletion, with her apology, but unable to\r\nbring it to the light.  Morris\xe2\x80\x99s own scenes were very small ones just\r\nnow; but even these were beyond his strength.  He made his visits as\r\nbrief as possible, and while he sat with his mistress, found terribly\r\nlittle to talk about.  She was waiting for him, in vulgar parlance, to\r\nname the day; and so long as he was unprepared to be explicit on this\r\npoint it seemed a mockery to pretend to talk about matters more abstract.\r\nShe had no airs and no arts; she never attempted to disguise her\r\nexpectancy.  She was waiting on his good pleasure, and would wait\r\nmodestly and patiently; his hanging back at this supreme time might\r\nappear strange, but of course he must have a good reason for it.\r\nCatherine would have made a wife of the gentle old-fashioned\r\npattern\xe2\x80\x94regarding reasons as favours and windfalls, but no more expecting\r\none every day than she would have expected a bouquet of camellias.\r\nDuring the period of her engagement, however, a young lady even of the\r\nmost slender pretensions counts upon more bouquets than at other times;\r\nand there was a want of perfume in the air at this moment which at last\r\nexcited the girl\xe2\x80\x99s alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sick?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked of Morris.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou seem so restless, and you look\r\npale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not at all well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris; and it occurred to him that, if he\r\ncould only make her pity him enough, he might get off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you are overworked; you oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to work so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must do that.\xe2\x80\x9d  And then he added, with a sort of calculated\r\nbrutality, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to owe you everything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, how can you say that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am too proud,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94you are too proud!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you must take me as I am,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can never change me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to change you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said gently.  \xe2\x80\x9cI will take you as you\r\nare!\xe2\x80\x9d  And she stood looking at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know people talk tremendously about a man\xe2\x80\x99s marrying a rich girl,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMorris remarked.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s excessively disagreeable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am not rich?\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are rich enough to make me talked about!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you are talked about.  It\xe2\x80\x99s an honour!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an honour I could easily dispense with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was on the point of asking him whether it were not a compensation for\r\nthis annoyance that the poor girl who had the misfortune to bring it upon\r\nhim, loved him so dearly and believed in him so truly; but she hesitated,\r\nthinking that this would perhaps seem an exacting speech, and while she\r\nhesitated, he suddenly left her.\r\n\r\nThe next time he came, however, she brought it out, and she told him\r\nagain that he was too proud.  He repeated that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t change, and\r\nthis time she felt the impulse to say that with a little effort he might\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nSometimes he thought that if he could only make a quarrel with her it\r\nmight help him; but the question was how to quarrel with a young woman\r\nwho had such treasures of concession.  \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you think the effort is\r\nall on your side!\xe2\x80\x9d he was reduced to exclaiming.  \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you believe that\r\nI have my own effort to make?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all yours now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy effort is finished and done with!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, mine is not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must bear things together,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what we ought to\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris attempted a natural smile.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere are some things which we can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nvery well bear together\xe2\x80\x94for instance, separation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you speak of separation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you don\xe2\x80\x99t like it; I knew you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going, Morris?\xe2\x80\x9d she suddenly asked.\r\n\r\nHe fixed his eye on her for a moment, and for a part of that moment she\r\nwas afraid of it.  \xe2\x80\x9cWill you promise not to make a scene?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA scene!\xe2\x80\x94do I make scenes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll women do!\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris, with the tone of large experience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t.  Where are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I should say I was going away on business, should you think it very\r\nstrange?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wondered a moment, gazing at him.  \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94no.  Not if you will take me\r\nwith you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake you with me\xe2\x80\x94on business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your business?  Your business is to be with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t earn my living with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris.  \xe2\x80\x9cOr rather,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried\r\nwith a sudden inspiration, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s just what I do\xe2\x80\x94or what the world says\r\nI do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis ought perhaps to have been a great stroke, but it miscarried.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine simply repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo New Orleans.  About buying some cotton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am perfectly willing to go to New Orleans.\xe2\x80\x9d  Catherine said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose I would take you to a nest of yellow fever?\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nMorris.  \xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose I would expose you at such a time as this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there is yellow fever, why should you go?  Morris, you must not go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is to make six thousand dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris.  \xe2\x80\x9cDo you grudge me\r\nthat satisfaction?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have no need of six thousand dollars.  You think too much about\r\nmoney!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can afford to say that?  This is a great chance; we heard of it last\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d  And he explained to her in what the chance consisted; and told\r\nher a long story, going over more than once several of the details, about\r\nthe remarkable stroke of business which he and his partner had planned\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nBut Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s imagination, for reasons best known to herself,\r\nabsolutely refused to be fired.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf you can go to New Orleans, I can\r\ngo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you catch yellow fever quite as easily as\r\nI?  I am every bit as strong as you, and not in the least afraid of any\r\nfever.  When we were in Europe, we were in very unhealthy places; my\r\nfather used to make me take some pills.  I never caught anything, and I\r\nnever was nervous.  What will be the use of six thousand dollars if you\r\ndie of a fever?  When persons are going to be married they oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to\r\nthink so much about business.  You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think about cotton, you\r\nshould think about me.  You can go to New Orleans some other time\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nwill always be plenty of cotton.  It isn\xe2\x80\x99t the moment to choose\xe2\x80\x94we have\r\nwaited too long already.\xe2\x80\x9d  She spoke more forcibly and volubly than he\r\nhad ever heard her, and she held his arm in her two hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make a scene!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Morris.  \xe2\x80\x9cI call this a\r\nscene.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s you that are making it!  I have never asked you anything before.\r\nWe have waited too long already.\xe2\x80\x9d  And it was a comfort to her to think\r\nthat she had hitherto asked so little; it seemed to make her right to\r\ninsist the greater now.\r\n\r\nMorris bethought himself a little.  \xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then; we won\xe2\x80\x99t talk about\r\nit any more.  I will transact my business by letter.\xe2\x80\x9d  And he began to\r\nsmooth his hat, as if to take leave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t go?\xe2\x80\x9d  And she stood looking up at him.\r\n\r\nHe could not give up his idea of provoking a quarrel; it was so much the\r\nsimplest way!  He bent his eyes on her upturned face, with the darkest\r\nfrown he could achieve.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not discreet.  You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t bully me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, as usual, she conceded everything.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am not discreet; I know I\r\nam too pressing.  But isn\xe2\x80\x99t it natural?  It is only for a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a moment you may do a great deal of harm.  Try and be calmer the next\r\ntime I come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen will you come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to make conditions?\xe2\x80\x9d Morris asked.  \xe2\x80\x9cI will come next\r\nSaturday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine begged; \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to come to-morrow.  I\r\nwill be very quiet,\xe2\x80\x9d she added; and her agitation had by this time become\r\nso great that the assurance was not becoming.  A sudden fear had come\r\nover her; it was like the solid conjunction of a dozen disembodied\r\ndoubts, and her imagination, at a single bound, had traversed an enormous\r\ndistance.  All her being, for the moment, centred in the wish to keep him\r\nin the room.\r\n\r\nMorris bent his head and kissed her forehead.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you are quiet, you\r\nare perfection,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut when you are violent, you are not in\r\ncharacter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s wish that there should be no violence about her save\r\nthe beating of her heart, which she could not help; and she went on, as\r\ngently as possible, \xe2\x80\x9cWill you promise to come to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said Saturday!\xe2\x80\x9d Morris answered, smiling.  He tried a frown at one\r\nmoment, a smile at another; he was at his wit\xe2\x80\x99s end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Saturday too,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, trying to smile.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut to-morrow\r\nfirst.\xe2\x80\x9d  He was going to the door, and she went with him quickly.  She\r\nleaned her shoulder against it; it seemed to her that she would do\r\nanything to keep him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I am prevented from coming to-morrow, you will say I have deceived\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you be prevented?  You can come if you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a busy man\xe2\x80\x94I am not a dangler!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Morris sternly.\r\n\r\nHis voice was so hard and unnatural that, with a helpless look at him,\r\nshe turned away; and then he quickly laid his hand on the door-knob.  He\r\nfelt as if he were absolutely running away from her.  But in an instant\r\nshe was close to him again, and murmuring in a tone none the less\r\npenetrating for being low, \xe2\x80\x9cMorris, you are going to leave me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, for a little while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor how long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill you are reasonable again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall never be reasonable in that way!\xe2\x80\x9d  And she tried to keep him\r\nlonger; it was almost a struggle.  \xe2\x80\x9cThink of what I have done!\xe2\x80\x9d she broke\r\nout.  \xe2\x80\x9cMorris, I have given up everything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have everything back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean something.  What is it?\xe2\x80\x94what\r\nhas happened?\xe2\x80\x94what have I done?\xe2\x80\x94what has changed you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will write to you\xe2\x80\x94that is better,\xe2\x80\x9d Morris stammered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you won\xe2\x80\x99t come back!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, bursting into tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Catherine,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t believe that I promise you that you\r\nshall see me again!\xe2\x80\x9d  And he managed to get away and to close the door\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was almost her last outbreak of passive grief; at least, she never\r\nindulged in another that the world knew anything about.  But this one was\r\nlong and terrible; she flung herself on the sofa and gave herself up to\r\nher misery.  She hardly knew what had happened; ostensibly she had only\r\nhad a difference with her lover, as other girls had had before, and the\r\nthing was not only not a rupture, but she was under no obligation to\r\nregard it even as a menace.  Nevertheless, she felt a wound, even if he\r\nhad not dealt it; it seemed to her that a mask had suddenly fallen from\r\nhis face.  He had wished to get away from her; he had been angry and\r\ncruel, and said strange things, with strange looks.  She was smothered\r\nand stunned; she buried her head in the cushions, sobbing and talking to\r\nherself.  But at last she raised herself, with the fear that either her\r\nfather or Mrs. Penniman would come in; and then she sat there, staring\r\nbefore her, while the room grew darker.  She said to herself that perhaps\r\nhe would come back to tell her he had not meant what he said; and she\r\nlistened for his ring at the door, trying to believe that this was\r\nprobable.  A long time passed, but Morris remained absent; the shadows\r\ngathered; the evening settled down on the meagre elegance of the light,\r\nclear-coloured room; the fire went out.  When it had grown dark,\r\nCatherine went to the window and looked out; she stood there for half an\r\nhour, on the mere chance that he would come up the steps.  At last she\r\nturned away, for she saw her father come in.  He had seen her at the\r\nwindow looking out, and he stopped a moment at the bottom of the white\r\nsteps, and gravely, with an air of exaggerated courtesy, lifted his hat\r\nto her.  The gesture was so incongruous to the condition she was in, this\r\nstately tribute of respect to a poor girl despised and forsaken was so\r\nout of place, that the thing gave her a kind of horror, and she hurried\r\naway to her room.  It seemed to her that she had given Morris up.\r\n\r\nShe had to show herself half an hour later, and she was sustained at\r\ntable by the immensity of her desire that her father should not perceive\r\nthat anything had happened.  This was a great help to her afterwards, and\r\nit served her (though never as much as she supposed) from the first.  On\r\nthis occasion Dr. Sloper was rather talkative.  He told a great many\r\nstories about a wonderful poodle that he had seen at the house of an old\r\nlady whom he visited professionally.  Catherine not only tried to appear\r\nto listen to the anecdotes of the poodle, but she endeavoured to interest\r\nherself in them, so as not to think of her scene with Morris.  That\r\nperhaps was an hallucination; he was mistaken, she was jealous; people\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t change like that from one day to another.  Then she knew that she\r\nhad had doubts before\xe2\x80\x94strange suspicions, that were at once vague and\r\nacute\xe2\x80\x94and that he had been different ever since her return from Europe:\r\nwhereupon she tried again to listen to her father, who told a story so\r\nremarkably well.  Afterwards she went straight to her own room; it was\r\nbeyond her strength to undertake to spend the evening with her aunt.  All\r\nthe evening, alone, she questioned herself.  Her trouble was terrible;\r\nbut was it a thing of her imagination, engendered by an extravagant\r\nsensibility, or did it represent a clear-cut reality, and had the worst\r\nthat was possible actually come to pass?  Mrs. Penniman, with a degree of\r\ntact that was as unusual as it was commendable, took the line of leaving\r\nher alone.  The truth is, that her suspicions having been aroused, she\r\nindulged a desire, natural to a timid person, that the explosion should\r\nbe localised.  So long as the air still vibrated she kept out of the way.\r\n\r\nShe passed and repassed Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s door several times in the course of\r\nthe evening, as if she expected to hear a plaintive moan behind it.  But\r\nthe room remained perfectly still; and accordingly, the last thing before\r\nretiring to her own couch, she applied for admittance.  Catherine was\r\nsitting up, and had a book that she pretended to be reading.  She had no\r\nwish to go to bed, for she had no expectation of sleeping.  After Mrs.\r\nPenniman had left her she sat up half the night, and she offered her\r\nvisitor no inducement to remain.  Her aunt came stealing in very gently,\r\nand approached her with great solemnity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you are in trouble, my dear.  Can I do anything to help\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not in any trouble whatever, and do not need any help,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nCatherine, fibbing roundly, and proving thereby that not only our faults,\r\nbut our most involuntary misfortunes, tend to corrupt our morals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas nothing happened to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing whatever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you very sure, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd can I really do nothing for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, aunt, but kindly leave me alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman, though she had been afraid of too warm a welcome before,\r\nwas now disappointed at so cold a one; and in relating afterwards, as she\r\ndid to many persons, and with considerable variations of detail, the\r\nhistory of the termination of her niece\xe2\x80\x99s engagement, she was usually\r\ncareful to mention that the young lady, on a certain occasion, had\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chustled\xe2\x80\x9d her out of the room.  It was characteristic of Mrs. Penniman\r\nthat she related this fact, not in the least out of malignity to\r\nCatherine, whom she very sufficiently pitied, but simply from a natural\r\ndisposition to embellish any subject that she touched.\r\n\r\nCatherine, as I have said, sat up half the night, as if she still\r\nexpected to hear Morris Townsend ring at the door.  On the morrow this\r\nexpectation was less unreasonable; but it was not gratified by the\r\nreappearance of the young man.  Neither had he written; there was not a\r\nword of explanation or reassurance.  Fortunately for Catherine she could\r\ntake refuge from her excitement, which had now become intense, in her\r\ndetermination that her father should see nothing of it.  How well she\r\ndeceived her father we shall have occasion to learn; but her innocent\r\narts were of little avail before a person of the rare perspicacity of\r\nMrs. Penniman.  This lady easily saw that she was agitated, and if there\r\nwas any agitation going forward, Mrs. Penniman was not a person to\r\nforfeit her natural share in it.  She returned to the charge the next\r\nevening, and requested her niece to lean upon her\xe2\x80\x94to unburden her heart.\r\nPerhaps she should be able to explain certain things that now seemed\r\ndark, and that she knew more about than Catherine supposed.  If Catherine\r\nhad been frigid the night before, to-day she was haughty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are completely mistaken, and I have not the least idea what you\r\nmean.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you are trying to fasten on me, and I have never\r\nhad less need of any one\xe2\x80\x99s explanations in my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this way the girl delivered herself, and from hour to hour kept her\r\naunt at bay.  From hour to hour Mrs. Penniman\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity grew.  She\r\nwould have given her little finger to know what Morris had said and done,\r\nwhat tone he had taken, what pretext he had found.  She wrote to him,\r\nnaturally, to request an interview; but she received, as naturally, no\r\nanswer to her petition.  Morris was not in a writing mood; for Catherine\r\nhad addressed him two short notes which met with no acknowledgment.\r\nThese notes were so brief that I may give them entire.  \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you give\r\nme some sign that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be so cruel as you seemed on\r\nTuesday?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that was the first; the other was a little longer.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf I was\r\nunreasonable or suspicious on Tuesday\xe2\x80\x94if I annoyed you or troubled you in\r\nany way\xe2\x80\x94I beg your forgiveness, and I promise never again to be so\r\nfoolish.  I am punished enough, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.  Dear Morris, you\r\nare killing me!\xe2\x80\x9d  These notes were despatched on the Friday and Saturday;\r\nbut Saturday and Sunday passed without bringing the poor girl the\r\nsatisfaction she desired.  Her punishment accumulated; she continued to\r\nbear it, however, with a good deal of superficial fortitude.  On Saturday\r\nmorning the Doctor, who had been watching in silence, spoke to his sister\r\nLavinia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe thing has happened\xe2\x80\x94the scoundrel has backed out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Penniman, who had bethought herself what she should\r\nsay to Catherine, but was not provided with a line of defence against her\r\nbrother, so that indignant negation was the only weapon in her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has begged for a reprieve, then, if you like that better!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to make you very happy that your daughter\xe2\x80\x99s affections have\r\nbeen trifled with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor; \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cfor I had foretold it!  It\xe2\x80\x99s a great\r\npleasure to be in the right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour pleasures make one shudder!\xe2\x80\x9d his sister exclaimed.\r\n\r\nCatherine went rigidly through her usual occupations; that is, up to the\r\npoint of going with her aunt to church on Sunday morning.  She generally\r\nwent to afternoon service as well; but on this occasion her courage\r\nfaltered, and she begged of Mrs. Penniman to go without her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure you have a secret,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman, with great\r\nsignificance, looking at her rather grimly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I have, I shall keep it!\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine answered, turning away.\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman started for church; but before she had arrived, she stopped\r\nand turned back, and before twenty minutes had elapsed she re-entered the\r\nhouse, looked into the empty parlours, and then went upstairs and knocked\r\nat Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s door.  She got no answer; Catherine was not in her room,\r\nand Mrs. Penniman presently ascertained that she was not in the house.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has gone to him, she has fled!\xe2\x80\x9d Lavinia cried, clasping her hands\r\nwith admiration and envy.  But she soon perceived that Catherine had\r\ntaken nothing with her\xe2\x80\x94all her personal property in her room was\r\nintact\xe2\x80\x94and then she jumped at the hypothesis that the girl had gone\r\nforth, not in tenderness, but in resentment.  \xe2\x80\x9cShe has followed him to\r\nhis own door\xe2\x80\x94she has burst upon him in his own apartment!\xe2\x80\x9d  It was in\r\nthese terms that Mrs. Penniman depicted to herself her niece\xe2\x80\x99s errand,\r\nwhich, viewed in this light, gratified her sense of the picturesque only\r\na shade less strongly than the idea of a clandestine marriage.  To visit\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s lover, with tears and reproaches, at his own residence, was an\r\nimage so agreeable to Mrs. Penniman\xe2\x80\x99s mind that she felt a sort of\r\n\xc3\xa6sthetic disappointment at its lacking, in this case, the harmonious\r\naccompaniments of darkness and storm.  A quiet Sunday afternoon appeared\r\nan inadequate setting for it; and, indeed, Mrs. Penniman was quite out of\r\nhumour with the conditions of the time, which passed very slowly as she\r\nsat in the front parlour in her bonnet and her cashmere shawl, awaiting\r\nCatherine\xe2\x80\x99s return.\r\n\r\nThis event at last took place.  She saw her\xe2\x80\x94at the window\xe2\x80\x94mount the\r\nsteps, and she went to await her in the hall, where she pounced upon her\r\nas soon as she had entered the house, and drew her into the parlour,\r\nclosing the door with solemnity.  Catherine was flushed, and her eye was\r\nbright.  Mrs. Penniman hardly knew what to think.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I venture to ask where you have been?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been to take a walk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.  \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you had gone to\r\nchurch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did go to church; but the service was shorter than usual.  And pray,\r\nwhere did you walk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know!\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour ignorance is most extraordinary!  Dear Catherine, you can trust\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to trust you with?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith your secret\xe2\x80\x94your sorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no sorrow!\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine fiercely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor child,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Penniman insisted, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t deceive me.  I know\r\neverything.  I have been requested to\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94to converse with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to converse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will relieve you.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s lines?\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98the grief\r\nthat does not speak!\xe2\x80\x99  My dear girl, it is better as it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is better?\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine asked.\r\n\r\nShe was really too perverse.  A certain amount of perversity was to be\r\nallowed for in a young lady whose lover had thrown her over; but not such\r\nan amount as would prove inconvenient to his apologists.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat you\r\nshould be reasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman, with some sternness.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nyou should take counsel of worldly prudence, and submit to practical\r\nconsiderations.  That you should agree to\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94separate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine had been ice up to this moment, but at this word she flamed up.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeparate?  What do you know about our separating?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman shook her head with a sadness in which there was almost a\r\nsense of injury.  \xe2\x80\x9cYour pride is my pride, and your susceptibilities are\r\nmine.  I see your side perfectly, but I also\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and she smiled with\r\nmelancholy suggestiveness\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI also see the situation as a whole!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis suggestiveness was lost upon Catherine, who repeated her violent\r\ninquiry.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you talk about separation; what do you know about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must study resignation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman, hesitating, but\r\nsententious at a venture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cResignation to what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo a change of\xe2\x80\x94of our plans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy plans have not changed!\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine, with a little laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but Mr. Townsend\xe2\x80\x99s have,\xe2\x80\x9d her aunt answered very gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was an imperious brevity in the tone of this inquiry, against which\r\nMrs. Penniman felt bound to protest; the information with which she had\r\nundertaken to supply her niece was, after all, a favour.  She had tried\r\nsharpness, and she had tried sternness: but neither would do; she was\r\nshocked at the girl\xe2\x80\x99s obstinacy.  \xe2\x80\x9cAh, well,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cif he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntold you! . . . \xe2\x80\x9d and she turned away.\r\n\r\nCatherine watched her a moment in silence; then she hurried after her,\r\nstopping her before she reached the door.  \xe2\x80\x9cTold me what?  What do you\r\nmean?  What are you hinting at and threatening me with?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it broken off?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Penniman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy engagement?  Not in the least!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon in that case.  I have spoken too soon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo soon!  Soon or late,\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine broke out, \xe2\x80\x9cyou speak foolishly and\r\ncruelly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened between you, then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked her aunt, struck by the\r\nsincerity of this cry.  \xe2\x80\x9cFor something certainly has happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing has happened but that I love him more and more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman was silent an instant.  \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason you\r\nwent to see him this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine flushed as if she had been struck.  \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I did go to see him!\r\nBut that\xe2\x80\x99s my own business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then; we won\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it.\xe2\x80\x9d  And Mrs. Penniman moved\r\ntowards the door again.  But she was stopped by a sudden imploring cry\r\nfrom the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt Lavinia, _where_ has he gone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you admit, then, that he has gone away?  Didn\xe2\x80\x99t they know at his\r\nhouse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey said he had left town.  I asked no more questions; I was ashamed,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Catherine, simply enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t have taken so compromising a step if you had had a little\r\nmore confidence in me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Penniman observed, with a good deal of\r\ngrandeur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it to New Orleans?\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine went on irrelevantly.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time Mrs. Penniman had heard of New Orleans in this\r\nconnexion; but she was averse to letting Catherine know that she was in\r\nthe dark.  She attempted to strike an illumination from the instructions\r\nshe had received from Morris.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Catherine,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a\r\nseparation has been agreed upon, the farther he goes away the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgreed upon?  Has he agreed upon it with you?\xe2\x80\x9d  A consummate sense of\r\nher aunt\xe2\x80\x99s meddlesome folly had come over her during the last five\r\nminutes, and she was sickened at the thought that Mrs. Penniman had been\r\nlet loose, as it were, upon her happiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe certainly has sometimes advised with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it you, then, that have changed him and made him so unnatural?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nCatherine cried.  \xe2\x80\x9cIs it you that have worked on him and taken him from\r\nme?  He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to you, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how you have anything to\r\ndo with what is between us!  Is it you that have made this plot and told\r\nhim to leave me?  How could you be so wicked, so cruel?  What have I ever\r\ndone to you; why can\xe2\x80\x99t you leave me alone?  I was afraid you would spoil\r\neverything; for you _do_ spoil everything you touch; I was afraid of you\r\nall the time we were abroad; I had no rest when I thought that you were\r\nalways talking to him.\xe2\x80\x9d  Catherine went on with growing vehemence,\r\npouring out in her bitterness and in the clairvoyance of her passion\r\n(which suddenly, jumping all processes, made her judge her aunt finally\r\nand without appeal) the uneasiness which had lain for so many months upon\r\nher heart.\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman was scared and bewildered; she saw no prospect of\r\nintroducing her little account of the purity of Morris\xe2\x80\x99s motives.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nare a most ungrateful girl!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.  \xe2\x80\x9cDo you scold me for talking\r\nwith him?  I am sure we never talked of anything but you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and that was the way you worried him; you made him tired of my very\r\nname!  I wish you had never spoken of me to him; I never asked your\r\nhelp!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for me he would never have come to the\r\nhouse, and you would never have known what he thought of you,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nPenniman rejoined, with a good deal of justice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish he never had come to the house, and that I never had known it!\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s better than this,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a very ungrateful girl,\xe2\x80\x9d Aunt Lavinia repeated.\r\n\r\nCatherine\xe2\x80\x99s outbreak of anger and the sense of wrong gave her, while they\r\nlasted, the satisfaction that comes from all assertion of force; they\r\nhurried her along, and there is always a sort of pleasure in cleaving the\r\nair.  But at the bottom she hated to be violent, and she was conscious of\r\nno aptitude for organised resentment.  She calmed herself with a great\r\neffort, but with great rapidity, and walked about the room a few moments,\r\ntrying to say to herself that her aunt had meant everything for the best.\r\nShe did not succeed in saying it with much conviction, but after a little\r\nshe was able to speak quietly enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not ungrateful, but I am very unhappy.  It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to be grateful\r\nfor that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.  \xe2\x80\x9cWill you please tell me where he is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t the least idea; I am not in secret correspondence with him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd Mrs. Penniman wished indeed that she were, so that she might let him\r\nknow how Catherine abused her, after all she had done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it a plan of his, then, to break off\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d  By this time Catherine had\r\nbecome completely quiet.\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman began again to have a glimpse of her chance for explaining.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe shrank\xe2\x80\x94he shrank,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe lacked courage, but it was the\r\ncourage to injure you!  He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to bring down on you your\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s curse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine listened to this with her eyes fixed upon her aunt, and\r\ncontinued to gaze at her for some time afterwards.  \xe2\x80\x9cDid he tell you to\r\nsay that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told me to say many things\xe2\x80\x94all so delicate, so discriminating.  And\r\nhe told me to tell you he hoped you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t despise him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.  And then she added: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd will he stay away\r\nfor ever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, for ever is a long time.  Your father, perhaps, won\xe2\x80\x99t live for\r\never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure you appreciate\xe2\x80\x94you understand\xe2\x80\x94even though your heart bleeds,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mrs. Penniman.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou doubtless think him too scrupulous.  So do I,\r\nbut I respect his scruples.  What he asks of you is that you should do\r\nthe same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine was still gazing at her aunt, but she spoke at last, as if she\r\nhad not heard or not understood her.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt has been a regular plan, then.\r\nHe has broken it off deliberately; he has given me up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the present, dear Catherine.  He has put it off only.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has left me alone,\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you _me_?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Penniman, with much expression.\r\n\r\nCatherine shook her head slowly.  \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it!\xe2\x80\x9d and she left the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOUGH she had forced herself to be calm, she preferred practising this\r\nvirtue in private, and she forbore to show herself at tea\xe2\x80\x94a repast which,\r\non Sundays, at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, took the place of dinner.  Dr. Sloper and his\r\nsister sat face to face, but Mrs. Penniman never met her brother\xe2\x80\x99s eye.\r\nLate in the evening she went with him, but without Catherine, to their\r\nsister Almond\xe2\x80\x99s, where, between the two ladies, Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s unhappy\r\nsituation was discussed with a frankness that was conditioned by a good\r\ndeal of mysterious reticence on Mrs. Penniman\xe2\x80\x99s part.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am delighted he is not to marry her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Almond, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he ought\r\nto be horsewhipped all the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman, who was shocked at her sister\xe2\x80\x99s coarseness, replied that\r\nhe had been actuated by the noblest of motives\xe2\x80\x94the desire not to\r\nimpoverish Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very happy that Catherine is not to be impoverished\xe2\x80\x94but I hope he\r\nmay never have a penny too much!  And what does the poor girl say to\r\n_you_?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Almond asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe says I have a genius for consolation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman.\r\n\r\nThis was the account of the matter that she gave to her sister, and it\r\nwas perhaps with the consciousness of genius that, on her return that\r\nevening to Washington Square, she again presented herself for admittance\r\nat Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s door.  Catherine came and opened it; she was apparently\r\nvery quiet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only want to give you a little word of advice,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf your\r\nfather asks you, say that everything is going on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine stood there, with her hand on the knob looking at her aunt, but\r\nnot asking her to come in.  \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think he will ask me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure he will.  He asked me just now, on our way home from your Aunt\r\nElizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s.  I explained the whole thing to your Aunt Elizabeth.  I said\r\nto your father I know nothing about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think he will ask me when he sees\xe2\x80\x94when he sees\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d  But here\r\nCatherine stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe more he sees the more disagreeable he will be,\xe2\x80\x9d said her aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe shall see as little as possible!\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him you are to be married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine softly; and she closed the door upon her aunt.\r\n\r\nShe could not have said this two days later\xe2\x80\x94for instance, on Tuesday,\r\nwhen she at last received a letter from Morris Townsend.  It was an\r\nepistle of considerable length, measuring five large square pages, and\r\nwritten at Philadelphia.  It was an explanatory document, and it\r\nexplained a great many things, chief among which were the considerations\r\nthat had led the writer to take advantage of an urgent \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nabsence to try and banish from his mind the image of one whose path he\r\nhad crossed only to scatter it with ruins.  He ventured to expect but\r\npartial success in this attempt, but he could promise her that, whatever\r\nhis failure, he would never again interpose between her generous heart\r\nand her brilliant prospects and filial duties.  He closed with an\r\nintimation that his professional pursuits might compel him to travel for\r\nsome months, and with the hope that when they should each have\r\naccommodated themselves to what was sternly involved in their respective\r\npositions\xe2\x80\x94even should this result not be reached for years\xe2\x80\x94they should\r\nmeet as friends, as fellow-sufferers, as innocent but philosophic victims\r\nof a great social law.  That her life should be peaceful and happy was\r\nthe dearest wish of him who ventured still to subscribe himself her most\r\nobedient servant.  The letter was beautifully written, and Catherine, who\r\nkept it for many years after this, was able, when her sense of the\r\nbitterness of its meaning and the hollowness of its tone had grown less\r\nacute, to admire its grace of expression.  At present, for a long time\r\nafter she received it, all she had to help her was the determination,\r\ndaily more rigid, to make no appeal to the compassion of her father.\r\n\r\nHe suffered a week to elapse, and then one day, in the morning, at an\r\nhour at which she rarely saw him, he strolled into the back parlour.  He\r\nhad watched his time, and he found her alone.  She was sitting with some\r\nwork, and he came and stood in front of her.  He was going out, he had on\r\nhis hat and was drawing on his gloves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to me that you are treating me just now with all the\r\nconsideration I deserve,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I have done,\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine answered, with her eyes on her\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have apparently quite banished from your mind the request I made you\r\nat Liverpool, before we sailed; the request that you would notify me in\r\nadvance before leaving my house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not left your house!\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you intend to leave it, and by what you gave me to understand, your\r\ndeparture must be impending.  In fact, though you are still here in body,\r\nyou are already absent in spirit.  Your mind has taken up its residence\r\nwith your prospective husband, and you might quite as well be lodged\r\nunder the conjugal roof, for all the benefit we get from your society.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will try and be more cheerful!\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou certainly ought to be cheerful, you ask a great deal if you are not.\r\nTo the pleasure of marrying a brilliant young man, you add that of having\r\nyour own way; you strike me as a very lucky young lady!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine got up; she was suffocating.  But she folded her work,\r\ndeliberately and correctly, bending her burning face upon it.  Her father\r\nstood where he had planted himself; she hoped he would go, but he\r\nsmoothed and buttoned his gloves, and then he rested his hands upon his\r\nhips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a convenience to me to know when I may expect to have an\r\nempty house,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you go, your aunt marches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him at last, with a long silent gaze, which, in spite of\r\nher pride and her resolution, uttered part of the appeal she had tried\r\nnot to make.  Her father\xe2\x80\x99s cold grey eye sounded her own, and he insisted\r\non his point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it to-morrow?  Is it next week, or the week after?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not go away!\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor raised his eyebrows.  \xe2\x80\x9cHas he backed out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have broken off my engagement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBroken it off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have asked him to leave New York, and he has gone away for a long\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor was both puzzled and disappointed, but he solved his\r\nperplexity by saying to himself that his daughter simply\r\nmisrepresented\xe2\x80\x94justifiably, if one would? but nevertheless\r\nmisrepresented\xe2\x80\x94the facts; and he eased off his disappointment, which was\r\nthat of a man losing a chance for a little triumph that he had rather\r\ncounted on, by a few words that he uttered aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does he take his dismissal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know!\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine, less ingeniously than she had hitherto\r\nspoken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean you don\xe2\x80\x99t care?  You are rather cruel, after encouraging him\r\nand playing with him for so long!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor had his revenge, after all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR story has hitherto moved with very short steps, but as it approaches\r\nits termination it must take a long stride.  As time went on, it might\r\nhave appeared to the Doctor that his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s account of her rupture\r\nwith Morris Townsend, mere bravado as he had deemed it, was in some\r\ndegree justified by the sequel.  Morris remained as rigidly and\r\nunremittingly absent as if he had died of a broken heart, and Catherine\r\nhad apparently buried the memory of this fruitless episode as deep as if\r\nit had terminated by her own choice.  We know that she had been deeply\r\nand incurably wounded, but the Doctor had no means of knowing it.  He was\r\ncertainly curious about it, and would have given a good deal to discover\r\nthe exact truth; but it was his punishment that he never knew\xe2\x80\x94his\r\npunishment, I mean, for the abuse of sarcasm in his relations with his\r\ndaughter.  There was a good deal of effective sarcasm in her keeping him\r\nin the dark, and the rest of the world conspired with her, in this sense,\r\nto be sarcastic.  Mrs. Penniman told him nothing, partly because he never\r\nquestioned her\xe2\x80\x94he made too light of Mrs. Penniman for that\xe2\x80\x94and partly\r\nbecause she flattered herself that a tormenting reserve, and a serene\r\nprofession of ignorance, would avenge her for his theory that she had\r\nmeddled in the matter.  He went two or three times to see Mrs.\r\nMontgomery, but Mrs. Montgomery had nothing to impart.  She simply knew\r\nthat her brother\xe2\x80\x99s engagement was broken off, and now that Miss Sloper\r\nwas out of danger she preferred not to bear witness in any way against\r\nMorris.  She had done so before\xe2\x80\x94however unwillingly\xe2\x80\x94because she was sorry\r\nfor Miss Sloper; but she was not sorry for Miss Sloper now\xe2\x80\x94not at all\r\nsorry.  Morris had told her nothing about his relations with Miss Sloper\r\nat the time, and he had told her nothing since.  He was always away, and\r\nhe very seldom wrote to her; she believed he had gone to California.\r\nMrs. Almond had, in her sister\xe2\x80\x99s phrase, \xe2\x80\x9ctaken up\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine violently\r\nsince the recent catastrophe; but though the girl was very grateful to\r\nher for her kindness, she revealed no secrets, and the good lady could\r\ngive the Doctor no satisfaction.  Even, however, had she been able to\r\nnarrate to him the private history of his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s unhappy love affair,\r\nit would have given her a certain comfort to leave him in ignorance; for\r\nMrs. Almond was at this time not altogether in sympathy with her brother.\r\nShe had guessed for herself that Catherine had been cruelly jilted\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nknew nothing from Mrs. Penniman, for Mrs. Penniman had not ventured to\r\nlay the famous explanation of Morris\xe2\x80\x99s motives before Mrs. Almond, though\r\nshe had thought it good enough for Catherine\xe2\x80\x94and she pronounced her\r\nbrother too consistently indifferent to what the poor creature must have\r\nsuffered and must still be suffering.  Dr. Sloper had his theory, and he\r\nrarely altered his theories.  The marriage would have been an abominable\r\none, and the girl had had a blessed escape.  She was not to be pitied for\r\nthat, and to pretend to condole with her would have been to make\r\nconcessions to the idea that she had ever had a right to think of Morris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI put my foot on this idea from the first, and I keep it there now,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Doctor.  \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything cruel in that; one can\xe2\x80\x99t keep it\r\nthere too long.\xe2\x80\x9d  To this Mrs. Almond more than once replied that if\r\nCatherine had got rid of her incongruous lover, she deserved the credit\r\nof it, and that to bring herself to her father\xe2\x80\x99s enlightened view of the\r\nmatter must have cost her an effort that he was bound to appreciate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am by no means sure she has got rid of him,\xe2\x80\x9d the Doctor said.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nis not the smallest probability that, after having been as obstinate as a\r\nmule for two years, she suddenly became amenable to reason.  It is\r\ninfinitely more probable that he got rid of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the more reason you should be gentle with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _am_ gentle with her.  But I can\xe2\x80\x99t do the pathetic; I can\xe2\x80\x99t pump up\r\ntears, to look graceful, over the most fortunate thing that ever happened\r\nto her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no sympathy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Almond; \xe2\x80\x9cthat was never your strong\r\npoint.  You have only to look at her to see that, right or wrong, and\r\nwhether the rupture came from herself or from him, her poor little heart\r\nis grievously bruised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHandling bruises\xe2\x80\x94and even dropping tears on them\xe2\x80\x94doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make them any\r\nbetter!  My business is to see she gets no more knocks, and that I shall\r\ncarefully attend to.  But I don\xe2\x80\x99t at all recognise your description of\r\nCatherine.  She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t strike me in the least as a young woman going\r\nabout in search of a moral poultice.  In fact, she seems to me much\r\nbetter than while the fellow was hanging about.  She is perfectly\r\ncomfortable and blooming; she eats and sleeps, takes her usual exercise,\r\nand overloads herself, as usual, with finery.  She is always knitting\r\nsome purse or embroidering some handkerchief, and it seems to me she\r\nturns these articles out about as fast as ever.  She hasn\xe2\x80\x99t much to say;\r\nbut when had she anything to say?  She had her little dance, and now she\r\nis sitting down to rest.  I suspect that, on the whole, she enjoys it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe enjoys it as people enjoy getting rid of a leg that has been\r\ncrushed.  The state of mind after amputation is doubtless one of\r\ncomparative repose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your leg is a metaphor for young Townsend, I can assure you he has\r\nnever been crushed.  Crushed?  Not he!  He is alive and perfectly intact,\r\nand that\xe2\x80\x99s why I am not satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you have liked to kill him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Almond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very much.  I think it is quite possible that it is all a blind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA blind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn arrangement between them.  _Il fait le mort_, as they say in France;\r\nbut he is looking out of the corner of his eye.  You can depend upon it\r\nhe has not burned his ships; he has kept one to come back in.  When I am\r\ndead, he will set sail again, and then she will marry him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is interesting to know that you accuse your only daughter of being\r\nthe vilest of hypocrites,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Almond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see what difference her being my only daughter makes.  It is\r\nbetter to accuse one than a dozen.  But I don\xe2\x80\x99t accuse any one.  There is\r\nnot the smallest hypocrisy about Catherine, and I deny that she even\r\npretends to be miserable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s idea that the thing was a \xe2\x80\x9cblind\xe2\x80\x9d had its intermissions and\r\nrevivals; but it may be said on the whole to have increased as he grew\r\nolder; together with his impression of Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s blooming and\r\ncomfortable condition.  Naturally, if he had not found grounds for\r\nviewing her as a lovelorn maiden during the year or two that followed her\r\ngreat trouble, he found none at a time when she had completely recovered\r\nher self-possession.  He was obliged to recognise the fact that if the\r\ntwo young people were waiting for him to get out of the way, they were at\r\nleast waiting very patiently.  He had heard from time to time that Morris\r\nwas in New York; but he never remained there long, and, to the best of\r\nthe Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s belief, had no communication with Catherine.  He was sure\r\nthey never met, and he had reason to suspect that Morris never wrote to\r\nher.  After the letter that has been mentioned, she heard from him twice\r\nagain, at considerable intervals; but on none of these occasions did she\r\nwrite herself.  On the other hand, as the Doctor observed, she averted\r\nherself rigidly from the idea of marrying other people.  Her\r\nopportunities for doing so were not numerous, but they occurred often\r\nenough to test her disposition.  She refused a widower, a man with a\r\ngenial temperament, a handsome fortune, and three little girls (he had\r\nheard that she was very fond of children, and he pointed to his own with\r\nsome confidence); and she turned a deaf ear to the solicitations of a\r\nclever young lawyer, who, with the prospect of a great practice, and the\r\nreputation of a most agreeable man, had had the shrewdness, when he came\r\nto look about him for a wife, to believe that she would suit him better\r\nthan several younger and prettier girls.  Mr. Macalister, the widower,\r\nhad desired to make a marriage of reason, and had chosen Catherine for\r\nwhat he supposed to be her latent matronly qualities; but John Ludlow,\r\nwho was a year the girl\xe2\x80\x99s junior, and spoken of always as a young man who\r\nmight have his \xe2\x80\x9cpick,\xe2\x80\x9d was seriously in love with her.  Catherine,\r\nhowever, would never look at him; she made it plain to him that she\r\nthought he came to see her too often.  He afterwards consoled himself,\r\nand married a very different person, little Miss Sturtevant, whose\r\nattractions were obvious to the dullest comprehension.  Catherine, at the\r\ntime of these events, had left her thirtieth year well behind her, and\r\nhad quite taken her place as an old maid.  Her father would have\r\npreferred she should marry, and he once told her that he hoped she would\r\nnot be too fastidious.  \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see you an honest man\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\nbefore I die,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  This was after John Ludlow had been compelled to\r\ngive it up, though the Doctor had advised him to persevere.  The Doctor\r\nexercised no further pressure, and had the credit of not \xe2\x80\x9cworrying\xe2\x80\x9d at\r\nall over his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s singleness.  In fact he worried rather more than\r\nappeared, and there were considerable periods during which he felt sure\r\nthat Morris Townsend was hidden behind some door.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf he is not, why\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t she marry?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself.  \xe2\x80\x9cLimited as her intelligence may\r\nbe, she must understand perfectly well that she is made to do the usual\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Catherine, however, became an admirable old maid.  She formed\r\nhabits, regulated her days upon a system of her own, interested herself\r\nin charitable institutions, asylums, hospitals, and aid societies; and\r\nwent generally, with an even and noiseless step, about the rigid business\r\nof her life.  This life had, however, a secret history as well as a\r\npublic one\xe2\x80\x94if I may talk of the public history of a mature and diffident\r\nspinster for whom publicity had always a combination of terrors.  From\r\nher own point of view the great facts of her career were that Morris\r\nTownsend had trifled with her affection, and that her father had broken\r\nits spring.  Nothing could ever alter these facts; they were always\r\nthere, like her name, her age, her plain face.  Nothing could ever undo\r\nthe wrong or cure the pain that Morris had inflicted on her, and nothing\r\ncould ever make her feel towards her father as she felt in her younger\r\nyears.  There was something dead in her life, and her duty was to try and\r\nfill the void.  Catherine recognised this duty to the utmost; she had a\r\ngreat disapproval of brooding and moping.  She had, of course, no faculty\r\nfor quenching memory in dissipation; but she mingled freely in the usual\r\ngaieties of the town, and she became at last an inevitable figure at all\r\nrespectable entertainments.  She was greatly liked, and as time went on\r\nshe grew to be a sort of kindly maiden aunt to the younger portion of\r\nsociety.  Young girls were apt to confide to her their love affairs\r\n(which they never did to Mrs. Penniman), and young men to be fond of her\r\nwithout knowing why.  She developed a few harmless eccentricities; her\r\nhabits, once formed, were rather stiffly maintained; her opinions, on all\r\nmoral and social matters, were extremely conservative; and before she was\r\nforty she was regarded as an old-fashioned person, and an authority on\r\ncustoms that had passed away.  Mrs. Penniman, in comparison, was quite a\r\ngirlish figure; she grew younger as she advanced in life.  She lost none\r\nof her relish for beauty and mystery, but she had little opportunity to\r\nexercise it.  With Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s later wooers she failed to establish\r\nrelations as intimate as those which had given her so many interesting\r\nhours in the society of Morris Townsend.  These gentlemen had an\r\nindefinable mistrust of her good offices, and they never talked to her\r\nabout Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s charms.  Her ringlets, her buckles and bangles,\r\nglistened more brightly with each succeeding year, and she remained quite\r\nthe same officious and imaginative Mrs. Penniman, and the odd mixture of\r\nimpetuosity and circumspection, that we have hitherto known.  As regards\r\none point, however, her circumspection prevailed, and she must be given\r\ndue credit for it.  For upwards of seventeen years she never mentioned\r\nMorris Townsend\xe2\x80\x99s name to her niece.  Catherine was grateful to her, but\r\nthis consistent silence, so little in accord with her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s character,\r\ngave her a certain alarm, and she could never wholly rid herself of a\r\nsuspicion that Mrs. Penniman sometimes had news of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE by little Dr. Sloper had retired from his profession; he visited\r\nonly those patients in whose symptoms he recognised a certain\r\noriginality.  He went again to Europe, and remained two years; Catherine\r\nwent with him, and on this occasion Mrs. Penniman was of the party.\r\nEurope apparently had few surprises for Mrs. Penniman, who frequently\r\nremarked, in the most romantic sites\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I am very familiar with\r\nall this.\xe2\x80\x9d  It should be added that such remarks were usually not\r\naddressed to her brother, or yet to her niece, but to fellow-tourists who\r\nhappened to be at hand, or even to the cicerone or the goat-herd in the\r\nforeground.\r\n\r\nOne day, after his return from Europe, the Doctor said something to his\r\ndaughter that made her start\xe2\x80\x94it seemed to come from so far out of the\r\npast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like you to promise me something before I die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you talk about your dying?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I am sixty-eight years old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you will live a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I shall!  But some day I shall take a bad cold, and then it will\r\nnot matter much what any one hopes.  That will be the manner of my exit,\r\nand when it takes place, remember I told you so.  Promise me not to marry\r\nMorris Townsend after I am gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was what made Catherine start, as I have said; but her start was a\r\nsilent one, and for some moments she said nothing.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you speak of\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou challenge everything I say.  I speak of him because he\xe2\x80\x99s a topic,\r\nlike any other.  He\xe2\x80\x99s to be seen, like any one else, and he is still\r\nlooking for a wife\xe2\x80\x94having had one and got rid of her, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know by\r\nwhat means.  He has lately been in New York, and at your cousin Marian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse; your Aunt Elizabeth saw him there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey neither of them told me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s their merit; it\xe2\x80\x99s not yours.  He has grown fat and bald, and he\r\nhas not made his fortune.  But I can\xe2\x80\x99t trust those facts alone to steel\r\nyour heart against him, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why I ask you to promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFat and bald\xe2\x80\x9d: these words presented a strange image to Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind, out of which the memory of the most beautiful young man in the\r\nworld had never faded.  \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you understand,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nvery seldom think of Mr. Townsend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be very easy for you to go on, then.  Promise me, after my\r\ndeath, to do the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain, for some moments, Catherine was silent; her father\xe2\x80\x99s request\r\ndeeply amazed her; it opened an old wound and made it ache afresh.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think I can promise that,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a great satisfaction,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.  I can\xe2\x80\x99t promise that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor was silent a minute.  \xe2\x80\x9cI ask you for a particular reason.  I\r\nam altering my will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis reason failed to strike Catherine; and indeed she scarcely\r\nunderstood it.  All her feelings were merged in the sense that he was\r\ntrying to treat her as he had treated her years before.  She had suffered\r\nfrom it then; and now all her experience, all her acquired tranquillity\r\nand rigidity, protested.  She had been so humble in her youth that she\r\ncould now afford to have a little pride, and there was something in this\r\nrequest, and in her father\xe2\x80\x99s thinking himself so free to make it, that\r\nseemed an injury to her dignity.  Poor Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s dignity was not\r\naggressive; it never sat in state; but if you pushed far enough you could\r\nfind it.  Her father had pushed very far.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t promise,\xe2\x80\x9d she simply repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very obstinate,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease explain, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t explain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I can\xe2\x80\x99t promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word,\xe2\x80\x9d her father explained, \xe2\x80\x9cI had no idea how obstinate you\r\nare!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe knew herself that she was obstinate, and it gave her a certain joy.\r\nShe was now a middle-aged woman.\r\n\r\nAbout a year after this, the accident that the Doctor had spoken of\r\noccurred; he took a violent cold.  Driving out to Bloomingdale one April\r\nday to see a patient of unsound mind, who was confined in a private\r\nasylum for the insane, and whose family greatly desired a medical opinion\r\nfrom an eminent source, he was caught in a spring shower, and being in a\r\nbuggy, without a hood, he found himself soaked to the skin.  He came home\r\nwith an ominous chill, and on the morrow he was seriously ill.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\ncongestion of the lungs,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Catherine; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall need very good\r\nnursing.  It will make no difference, for I shall not recover; but I wish\r\neverything to be done, to the smallest detail, as if I should.  I hate an\r\nill-conducted sick-room; and you will be so good as to nurse me on the\r\nhypothesis that I shall get well.\xe2\x80\x9d  He told her which of his\r\nfellow-physicians to send for, and gave her a multitude of minute\r\ndirections; it was quite on the optimistic hypothesis that she nursed\r\nhim.  But he had never been wrong in his life, and he was not wrong now.\r\nHe was touching his seventieth year, and though he had a very\r\nwell-tempered constitution, his hold upon life had lost its firmness.  He\r\ndied after three weeks\xe2\x80\x99 illness, during which Mrs. Penniman, as well as\r\nhis daughter, had been assiduous at his bedside.\r\n\r\nOn his will being opened after a decent interval, it was found to consist\r\nof two portions.  The first of these dated from ten years back, and\r\nconsisted of a series of dispositions by which he left the great mass of\r\nproperty to his daughter, with becoming legacies to his two sisters.  The\r\nsecond was a codicil, of recent origin, maintaining the annuities to Mrs.\r\nPenniman and Mrs. Almond, but reducing Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s share to a fifth of\r\nwhat he had first bequeathed her.  \xe2\x80\x9cShe is amply provided for from her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s side,\xe2\x80\x9d the document ran, \xe2\x80\x9cnever having spent more than a\r\nfraction of her income from this source; so that her fortune is already\r\nmore than sufficient to attract those unscrupulous adventurers whom she\r\nhas given me reason to believe that she persists in regarding as an\r\ninteresting class.\xe2\x80\x9d  The large remainder of his property, therefore, Dr.\r\nSloper had divided into seven unequal parts, which he left, as\r\nendowments, to as many different hospitals and schools of medicine, in\r\nvarious cities of the Union.\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. Penniman it seemed monstrous that a man should play such tricks\r\nwith other people\xe2\x80\x99s money; for after his death, of course, as she said,\r\nit was other people\xe2\x80\x99s.  \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, you will dispute the will,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nremarked, fatuously, to Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no,\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI like it very much.  Only I wish it had\r\nbeen expressed a little differently!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was her habit to remain in town very late in the summer; she preferred\r\nthe house in Washington Square to any other habitation whatever, and it\r\nwas under protest that she used to go to the seaside for the month of\r\nAugust.  At the sea she spent her month at an hotel.  The year that her\r\nfather died she intermitted this custom altogether, not thinking it\r\nconsistent with deep mourning; and the year after that she put off her\r\ndeparture till so late that the middle of August found her still in the\r\nheated solitude of Washington Square.  Mrs. Penniman, who was fond of a\r\nchange, was usually eager for a visit to the country; but this year she\r\nappeared quite content with such rural impressions as she could gather,\r\nat the parlour window, from the ailantus-trees behind the wooden paling.\r\nThe peculiar fragrance of this vegetation used to diffuse itself in the\r\nevening air, and Mrs. Penniman, on the warm nights of July, often sat at\r\nthe open window and inhaled it.  This was a happy moment for Mrs.\r\nPenniman; after the death of her brother she felt more free to obey her\r\nimpulses.  A vague oppression had disappeared from her life, and she\r\nenjoyed a sense of freedom of which she had not been conscious since the\r\nmemorable time, so long ago, when the Doctor went abroad with Catherine\r\nand left her at home to entertain Morris Townsend.  The year that had\r\nelapsed since her brother\xe2\x80\x99s death reminded her\xe2\x80\x94of that happy time,\r\nbecause, although Catherine, in growing older, had become a person to be\r\nreckoned with, yet her society was a very different thing, as Mrs.\r\nPenniman said, from that of a tank of cold water.  The elder lady hardly\r\nknew what use to make of this larger margin of her life; she sat and\r\nlooked at it very much as she had often sat, with her poised needle in\r\nher hand, before her tapestry frame.  She had a confident hope, however,\r\nthat her rich impulses, her talent for embroidery, would still find their\r\napplication, and this confidence was justified before many months had\r\nelapsed.\r\n\r\nCatherine continued to live in her father\xe2\x80\x99s house in spite of its being\r\nrepresented to her that a maiden lady of quiet habits might find a more\r\nconvenient abode in one of the smaller dwellings, with brown stone\r\nfronts, which had at this time begun to adorn the transverse\r\nthoroughfares in the upper part of the town.  She liked the earlier\r\nstructure\xe2\x80\x94it had begun by this time to be called an \xe2\x80\x9cold\xe2\x80\x9d house\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nproposed to herself to end her days in it.  If it was too large for a\r\npair of unpretending gentlewomen, this was better than the opposite\r\nfault; for Catherine had no desire to find herself in closer quarters\r\nwith her aunt.  She expected to spend the rest of her life in Washington\r\nSquare, and to enjoy Mrs. Penniman\xe2\x80\x99s society for the whole of this\r\nperiod; as she had a conviction that, long as she might live, her aunt\r\nwould live at least as long, and always retain her brilliancy and\r\nactivity.  Mrs. Penniman suggested to her the idea of a rich vitality.\r\n\r\nOn one of those warm evenings in July of which mention has been made, the\r\ntwo ladies sat together at an open window, looking out on the quiet\r\nSquare.  It was too hot for lighted lamps, for reading, or for work; it\r\nmight have appeared too hot even for conversation, Mrs. Penniman having\r\nlong been speechless.  She sat forward in the window, half on the\r\nbalcony, humming a little song.  Catherine was within the room, in a low\r\nrocking-chair, dressed in white, and slowly using a large palmetto fan.\r\nIt was in this way, at this season, that the aunt and niece, after they\r\nhad had tea, habitually spent their evenings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatherine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman at last, \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to say something\r\nthat will surprise you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray do,\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine answered; \xe2\x80\x9cI like surprises.  And it is so quiet\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I have seen Morris Townsend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Catherine was surprised, she checked the expression of it; she gave\r\nneither a start nor an exclamation.  She remained, indeed, for some\r\nmoments intensely still, and this may very well have been a symptom of\r\nemotion.  \xe2\x80\x9cI hope he was well,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know; he is a great deal changed.  He would like very much to\r\nsee you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather not see him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid you would say that.  But you don\xe2\x80\x99t seem surprised!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am\xe2\x80\x94very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI met him at Marian\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe goes to Marian\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\nthey are so afraid you will meet him there.  It\xe2\x80\x99s my belief that that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhy he goes.  He wants so much to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d  Catherine made no response\r\nto this, and Mrs. Penniman went on.  \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know him at first; he is\r\nso remarkably changed.  But he knew me in a minute.  He says I am not in\r\nthe least changed.  You know how polite he always was.  He was coming\r\naway when I came, and we walked a little distance together.  He is still\r\nvery handsome, only, of course, he looks older, and he is not so\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nanimated as he used to be.  There was a touch of sadness about him; but\r\nthere was a touch of sadness about him before\xe2\x80\x94especially when he went\r\naway.  I am afraid he has not been very successful\xe2\x80\x94that he has never got\r\nthoroughly established.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose he is sufficiently plodding, and\r\nthat, after all, is what succeeds in this world.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mrs. Penniman had not\r\nmentioned Morris Townsend\xe2\x80\x99s name to her niece for upwards of the fifth of\r\na century; but now that she had broken the spell, she seemed to wish to\r\nmake up for lost time, as if there had been a sort of exhilaration in\r\nhearing herself talk of him.  She proceeded, however, with considerable\r\ncaution, pausing occasionally to let Catherine give some sign.  Catherine\r\ngave no other sign than to stop the rocking of her chair and the swaying\r\nof her fan; she sat motionless and silent.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt was on Tuesday last,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mrs. Penniman, \xe2\x80\x9cand I have been hesitating ever since about telling\r\nyou.  I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how you might like it.  At last I thought that it was\r\nso long ago that you would probably not have any particular feeling.  I\r\nsaw him again, after meeting him at Marian\xe2\x80\x99s.  I met him in the street,\r\nand he went a few steps with me.  The first thing he said was about you;\r\nhe asked ever so many questions.  Marian didn\xe2\x80\x99t want me to speak to you;\r\nshe didn\xe2\x80\x99t want you to know that they receive him.  I told him I was sure\r\nthat after all these years you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have any feeling about that; you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t grudge him the hospitality of his own cousin\xe2\x80\x99s house.  I said\r\nyou would be bitter indeed if you did that.  Marian has the most\r\nextraordinary ideas about what happened between you; she seems to think\r\nhe behaved in some very unusual manner.  I took the liberty of reminding\r\nher of the real facts, and placing the story in its true light.  _He_ has\r\nno bitterness, Catherine, I can assure you; and he might be excused for\r\nit, for things have not gone well with him.  He has been all over the\r\nworld, and tried to establish himself everywhere; but his evil star was\r\nagainst him.  It is most interesting to hear him talk of his evil star.\r\nEverything failed; everything but his\xe2\x80\x94you know, you remember\xe2\x80\x94his proud,\r\nhigh spirit.  I believe he married some lady somewhere in Europe.  You\r\nknow they marry in such a peculiar matter-of-course way in Europe; a\r\nmarriage of reason they call it.  She died soon afterwards; as he said to\r\nme, she only flitted across his life.  He has not been in New York for\r\nten years; he came back a few days ago.  The first thing he did was to\r\nask me about you.  He had heard you had never married; he seemed very\r\nmuch interested about that.  He said you had been the real romance of his\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine had suffered her companion to proceed from point to point, and\r\npause to pause, without interrupting her; she fixed her eyes on the\r\nground and listened.  But the last phrase I have quoted was followed by a\r\npause of peculiar significance, and then, at last, Catherine spoke.  It\r\nwill be observed that before doing so she had received a good deal of\r\ninformation about Morris Townsend.  \xe2\x80\x9cPlease say no more; please don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfollow up that subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t it interest you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Penniman, with a certain timorous\r\narchness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt pains me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid you would say that.  But don\xe2\x80\x99t you think you could get used\r\nto it?  He wants so much to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t, Aunt Lavinia,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine, getting up from her seat.\r\nShe moved quickly away, and went to the other window, which stood open to\r\nthe balcony; and here, in the embrasure, concealed from her aunt by the\r\nwhite curtains, she remained a long time, looking out into the warm\r\ndarkness.  She had had a great shock; it was as if the gulf of the past\r\nhad suddenly opened, and a spectral figure had risen out of it.  There\r\nwere some things she believed she had got over, some feelings that she\r\nhad thought of as dead; but apparently there was a certain vitality in\r\nthem still.  Mrs. Penniman had made them stir themselves.  It was but a\r\nmomentary agitation, Catherine said to herself; it would presently pass\r\naway.  She was trembling, and her heart was beating so that she could\r\nfeel it; but this also would subside.  Then, suddenly, while she waited\r\nfor a return of her calmness, she burst into tears.  But her tears flowed\r\nvery silently, so that Mrs. Penniman had no observation of them.  It was\r\nperhaps, however, because Mrs. Penniman suspected them that she said no\r\nmore that evening about Morris Townsend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nHER refreshed attention to this gentleman had not those limits of which\r\nCatherine desired, for herself, to be conscious; it lasted long enough to\r\nenable her to wait another week before speaking of him again.  It was\r\nunder the same circumstances that she once more attacked the subject.\r\nShe had been sitting with her niece in the evening; only on this\r\noccasion, as the night was not so warm, the lamp had been lighted, and\r\nCatherine had placed herself near it with a morsel of fancy-work.  Mrs.\r\nPenniman went and sat alone for half an hour on the balcony; then she\r\ncame in, moving vaguely about the room.  At last she sank into a seat\r\nnear Catherine, with clasped hands, and a little look of excitement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall you be angry if I speak to you again about _him_?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nCatherine looked up at her quietly.  \xe2\x80\x9cWho is _he_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe whom you once loved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not be angry, but I shall not like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe sent you a message,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Penniman.  \xe2\x80\x9cI promised him to deliver\r\nit, and I must keep my promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn all these years Catherine had had time to forget how little she had to\r\nthank her aunt for in the season of her misery; she had long ago forgiven\r\nMrs. Penniman for taking too much upon herself.  But for a moment this\r\nattitude of interposition and disinterestedness, this carrying of\r\nmessages and redeeming of promises, brought back the sense that her\r\ncompanion was a dangerous woman.  She had said she would not be angry;\r\nbut for an instant she felt sore.  \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care what you do with your\r\npromise!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\nMrs. Penniman, however, with her high conception of the sanctity of\r\npledges, carried her point.  \xe2\x80\x9cI have gone too far to retreat,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nthough precisely what this meant she was not at pains to explain.  \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nTownsend wishes most particularly to see you, Catherine; he believes that\r\nif you knew how much, and why, he wishes it, you would consent to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere can be no reason,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine; \xe2\x80\x9cno good reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis happiness depends upon it.  Is not that a good reason?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs.\r\nPenniman impressively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for me.  My happiness does not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you will be happier after you have seen him.  He is going away\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94going to resume his wanderings.  It is a very lonely, restless,\r\njoyless life.  Before he goes he wishes to speak to you; it is a fixed\r\nidea with him\xe2\x80\x94he is always thinking of it.  He has something very\r\nimportant to say to you.  He believes that you never understood him\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nyou never judged him rightly, and the belief has always weighed upon him\r\nterribly.  He wishes to justify himself; he believes that in a very few\r\nwords he could do so.  He wishes to meet you as a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine listened to this wonderful speech without pausing in her work;\r\nshe had now had several days to accustom herself to think of Morris\r\nTownsend again as an actuality.  When it was over she said simply,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease say to Mr. Townsend that I wish he would leave me alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had hardly spoken when a sharp, firm ring at the door vibrated\r\nthrough the summer night.  Catherine looked up at the clock; it marked a\r\nquarter-past nine\xe2\x80\x94a very late hour for visitors, especially in the empty\r\ncondition of the town.  Mrs. Penniman at the same moment gave a little\r\nstart, and then Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s eyes turned quickly to her aunt.  They met\r\nMrs. Penniman\xe2\x80\x99s and sounded them for a moment, sharply.  Mrs. Penniman\r\nwas blushing; her look was a conscious one; it seemed to confess\r\nsomething.  Catherine guessed its meaning, and rose quickly from her\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt Penniman,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a tone that scared her companion, \xe2\x80\x9chave you\r\ntaken the _liberty_ . . . ?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest Catherine,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Mrs. Penniman, \xe2\x80\x9cjust wait till you see\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine had frightened her aunt, but she was also frightened herself;\r\nshe was on the point of rushing to give orders to the servant, who was\r\npassing to the door, to admit no one; but the fear of meeting her visitor\r\nchecked her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Morris Townsend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was what she heard, vaguely but recognisably articulated by the\r\ndomestic, while she hesitated.  She had her back turned to the door of\r\nthe parlour, and for some moments she kept it turned, feeling that he had\r\ncome in.  He had not spoken, however, and at last she faced about.  Then\r\nshe saw a gentleman standing in the middle of the room, from which her\r\naunt had discreetly retired.\r\n\r\nShe would never have known him.  He was forty-five years old, and his\r\nfigure was not that of the straight, slim young man she remembered.  But\r\nit was a very fine person, and a fair and lustrous beard, spreading\r\nitself upon a well-presented chest, contributed to its effect.  After a\r\nmoment Catherine recognised the upper half of the face, which, though her\r\nvisitor\xe2\x80\x99s clustering locks had grown thin, was still remarkably handsome.\r\nHe stood in a deeply deferential attitude, with his eyes on her face.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave ventured\xe2\x80\x94I have ventured,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; and then he paused, looking\r\nabout him, as if he expected her to ask him to sit down.  It was the old\r\nvoice, but it had not the old charm.  Catherine, for a minute, was\r\nconscious of a distinct determination not to invite him to take a seat.\r\nWhy had he come?  It was wrong for him to come.  Morris was embarrassed,\r\nbut Catherine gave him no help.  It was not that she was glad of his\r\nembarrassment; on the contrary, it excited all her own liabilities of\r\nthis kind, and gave her great pain.  But how could she welcome him when\r\nshe felt so vividly that he ought not to have come?  \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted so much\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwas determined,\xe2\x80\x9d Morris went on.  But he stopped again; it was not easy.\r\nCatherine still said nothing, and he may well have recalled with\r\napprehension her ancient faculty of silence.  She continued to look at\r\nhim, however, and as she did so she made the strangest observation.  It\r\nseemed to be he, and yet not he; it was the man who had been everything,\r\nand yet this person was nothing.  How long ago it was\xe2\x80\x94how old she had\r\ngrown\xe2\x80\x94how much she had lived!  She had lived on something that was\r\nconnected with _him_, and she had consumed it in doing so.  This person\r\ndid not look unhappy.  He was fair and well-preserved, perfectly dressed,\r\nmature and complete.  As Catherine looked at him, the story of his life\r\ndefined itself in his eyes; he had made himself comfortable, and he had\r\nnever been caught.  But even while her perception opened itself to this,\r\nshe had no desire to catch him; his presence was painful to her, and she\r\nonly wished he would go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you not sit down?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we had better not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI offend you by coming?\xe2\x80\x9d  He was very grave; he spoke in a tone of the\r\nrichest respect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you ought to have come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid not Mrs. Penniman tell you\xe2\x80\x94did she not give you my message?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe told me something, but I did not understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would let _me_ tell you\xe2\x80\x94let me speak for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for you, perhaps, but for me.  It would be a great satisfaction\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nI have not many.\xe2\x80\x9d  He seemed to be coming nearer; Catherine turned away.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan we not be friends again?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not enemies,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.  \xe2\x80\x9cI have none but friendly feelings\r\nto you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I wonder whether you know the happiness it gives me to hear you say\r\nthat!\xe2\x80\x9d  Catherine uttered no intimation that she measured the influence\r\nof her words; and he presently went on, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have not changed\xe2\x80\x94the years\r\nhave passed happily for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have passed very quietly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have left no marks; you are admirably young.\xe2\x80\x9d  This time he\r\nsucceeded in coming nearer\xe2\x80\x94he was close to her; she saw his glossy\r\nperfumed beard, and his eyes above it looking strange and hard.  It was\r\nvery different from his old\xe2\x80\x94from his young\xe2\x80\x94face.  If she had first seen\r\nhim this way she would not have liked him.  It seemed to her that he was\r\nsmiling, or trying to smile.  \xe2\x80\x9cCatherine,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, lowering his voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never ceased to think of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t say those things,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hate me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\nSomething in her tone discouraged him, but in a moment he recovered\r\nhimself.  \xe2\x80\x9cHave you still some kindness for me, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you have come here to ask me such things!\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause for many years it has been the desire of my life that we should\r\nbe friends again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?  Not if you will allow it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not allow it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her again in silence.  \xe2\x80\x9cI see; my presence troubles you and\r\npains you.  I will go away; but you must give me leave to come again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t come again,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever?\xe2\x80\x94never?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made a great effort; she wished to say something that would make it\r\nimpossible he should ever again cross her threshold.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is wrong of\r\nyou.  There is no propriety in it\xe2\x80\x94no reason for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, dearest lady, you do me injustice!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Morris Townsend.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe have\r\nonly waited, and now we are free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou treated me badly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if you think of it rightly.  You had your quiet life with your\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x94which was just what I could not make up my mind to rob you of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I had that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris felt it to be a considerable damage to his cause that he could not\r\nadd that she had had something more besides; for it is needless to say\r\nthat he had learnt the contents of Dr. Sloper\xe2\x80\x99s will.  He was\r\nnevertheless not at a loss.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere are worse fates than that!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed, with expression; and he might have been supposed to refer to\r\nhis own unprotected situation.  Then he added, with a deeper tenderness,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatherine, have you never forgiven me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forgave you years ago, but it is useless for us to attempt to be\r\nfriends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if we forget the past.  We have still a future, thank God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t forget\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t forget,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou treated me too\r\nbadly.  I felt it very much; I felt it for years.\xe2\x80\x9d  And then she went on,\r\nwith her wish to show him that he must not come to her this way, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbegin again\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t take it up.  Everything is dead and buried.  It was\r\ntoo serious; it made a great change in my life.  I never expected to see\r\nyou here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you are angry!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Morris, who wished immensely that he could\r\nextort some flash of passion from her mildness.  In that case he might\r\nhope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am not angry.  Anger does not last, that way, for years.  But\r\nthere are other things.  Impressions last, when they have been strong.\r\nBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorris stood stroking his beard, with a clouded eye.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you never\r\nmarried?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked abruptly.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou have had opportunities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t wish to marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you are rich, you are free; you had nothing to gain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had nothing to gain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\nMorris looked vaguely round him, and gave a deep sigh.  \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I was in\r\nhopes that we might still have been friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI meant to tell you, by my aunt, in answer to your message\xe2\x80\x94if you had\r\nwaited for an answer\xe2\x80\x94that it was unnecessary for you to come in that\r\nhope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris.  \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse my indiscretion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bowed, and she turned away\xe2\x80\x94standing there, averted, with her eyes on\r\nthe ground, for some moments after she had heard him close the door of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nIn the hall he found Mrs. Penniman, fluttered and eager; she appeared to\r\nhave been hovering there under the irreconcilable promptings of her\r\ncuriosity and her dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was a precious plan of yours!\xe2\x80\x9d said Morris, clapping on his hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she so hard?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Penniman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care a button for me\xe2\x80\x94with her confounded little dry manner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it very dry?\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mrs. Penniman, with solicitude.\r\n\r\nMorris took no notice of her question; he stood musing an instant, with\r\nhis hat on.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut why the deuce, then, would she never marry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94why indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Mrs. Penniman.  And then, as if from a sense of\r\nthe inadequacy of this explanation, \xe2\x80\x9cBut you will not despair\xe2\x80\x94you will\r\ncome back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome back?  Damnation!\xe2\x80\x9d  And Morris Townsend strode out of the house,\r\nleaving Mrs. Penniman staring.\r\n\r\nCatherine, meanwhile, in the parlour, picking up her morsel of fancy\r\nwork, had seated herself with it again\xe2\x80\x94for life, as it were.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WASHINGTON SQUARE***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 2870-0.txt or 2870-0.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/8/7/2870\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
