I rose and looked out, and\r\nthough I was far from realizing it at the time, took, by so doing, my\r\nfirst step in a course of inquiry which has ended----\r\n\r\nBut it is too soon to speak of the end. Rather let me tell you what I\r\nsaw when I parted the curtains of my window in Gramercy Park, on the\r\nnight of September 17, 1895.\r\n\r\nNot much at first glance, only a common hack drawn up at the neighboring\r\ncurb-stone. The lamp which is supposed to light our part of the block is\r\nsome rods away on the opposite side of the street, so that I obtained\r\nbut a shadowy glimpse of a young man and woman standing below me on the\r\npavement. I could see, however, that the woman--and not the man--was\r\nputting money into the driver\'s hand. The next moment they were on the\r\nstoop of this long-closed house, and the coach rolled off.\r\n\r\nIt was dark, as I have said, and I did not recognize the young\r\npeople,--at least their figures were not familiar to me; but when, in\r\nanother instant, I heard the click of a night-key, and saw them, after a\r\nrather tedious fumbling at the lock, disappear from the stoop, I took it\r\nfor granted that the gentleman was Mr. Van Burnam\'s eldest son Franklin,\r\nand the lady some relative of the family; though why this, its most\r\npunctilious member, should bring a guest at so late an hour into a house\r\ndevoid of everything necessary to make the least exacting visitor\r\ncomfortable, was a mystery that I retired to bed to meditate upon.\r\n\r\nI did not succeed in solving it, however, and after some ten minutes had\r\nelapsed, I was settling myself again to sleep when I was re-aroused by a\r\nfresh sound from the quarter mentioned. The door I had so lately heard\r\nshut, opened again, and though I had to rush for it, I succeeded in\r\ngetting to my window in time to catch a glimpse of the departing figure\r\nof the young man hurrying away towards Broadway. The young woman was not\r\nwith him, and as I realized that he had left her behind him in the\r\ngreat, empty house, without apparent light and certainly without any\r\ncompanion, I began to question if this was like Franklin Van Burnam. Was\r\nit not more in keeping with the recklessness of his more easy-natured\r\nand less reliable brother, Howard, who, some two or three years back,\r\nhad married a young wife of no very satisfactory antecedents, and who,\r\nas I had heard, had been ostracized by the family in consequence?\r\n\r\nWhichever of the two it was, he had certainly shown but little\r\nconsideration for his companion, and thus thinking, I fell off to sleep\r\njust as the clock struck the half hour after midnight.\r\n\r\nNext morning as soon as modesty would permit me to approach the window,\r\nI surveyed the neighboring house minutely. Not a blind was open, nor a\r\nshutter displaced. As I am an early riser, this did not disturb me at\r\nthe time, but when after breakfast I looked again and still failed to\r\ndetect any evidences of life in the great barren front beside me, I\r\nbegan to feel uneasy. But I did nothing till noon, when going into my\r\nrear garden and observing that the back windows of the Van Burnam house\r\nwere as closely shuttered as the front, I became so anxious that I\r\nstopped the next policeman I saw going by, and telling him my\r\nsuspicions, urged him to ring the bell.\r\n\r\nNo answer followed the summons.\r\n\r\n"There is no one here," said he.\r\n\r\n"Ring again!" I begged.\r\n\r\nAnd he rang again but with no better result.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you see that the house is shut up?" he grumbled. "We have had\r\norders to watch the place, but none to take the watch off."\r\n\r\n"There is a young woman inside," I insisted. "The more I think over last\r\nnight\'s occurrence, the more I am convinced that the matter should be\r\nlooked into."\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders and was moving away when we both observed a\r\ncommon-looking woman standing in front looking at us. She had a bundle\r\nin her hand, and her face, unnaturally ruddy though it was, had a scared\r\nlook which was all the more remarkable from the fact that it was one of\r\nthose wooden-like countenances which under ordinary circumstances are\r\ncapable of but little expression. She was not a stranger to me; that is,\r\nI had seen her before in or about the house in which we were at that\r\nmoment so interested; and not stopping to put any curb on my excitement,\r\nI rushed down to the pavement and accosted her.\r\n\r\n"Who are you?" I asked. "Do you work for the Van Burnams, and do you\r\nknow who the lady was who came here last night?"\r\n\r\nThe poor woman, either startled by my sudden address or by my manner\r\nwhich may have been a little sharp, gave a quick bound backward, and was\r\nonly deterred by the near presence of the policeman from attempting\r\nflight. As it was, she stood her ground, though the fiery flush, which\r\nmade her face so noticeable, deepened till her cheeks and brow were\r\nscarlet.\r\n\r\n"I am the scrub-woman," she protested. "I have come to open the windows\r\nand air the house,"--ignoring my last question.\r\n\r\n"Is the family coming home?" the policeman asked.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; I think so," was her weak reply.\r\n\r\n"Have you the keys?" I now demanded, seeing her fumbling in her pocket.\r\n\r\nShe did not answer; a sly look displaced the anxious one she had\r\nhitherto displayed, and she turned away.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see what business it is of the neighbors," she muttered,\r\nthrowing me a dissatisfied scowl over her shoulder.\r\n\r\n"If you\'ve got the keys, we will go in and see that things are all\r\nright," said the policeman, stopping her with a light touch.\r\n\r\nShe trembled; I saw that she trembled, and naturally became excited.\r\nSomething was wrong in the Van Burnam mansion, and I was going to be\r\npresent at its discovery. But her next words cut my hopes short.\r\n\r\n"I have no objection to _your_ going in," she said to the policeman,\r\n"but I will not give up my keys to _her_. What right has she in our\r\nhouse any way." And I thought I heard her murmur something about a\r\nmeddlesome old maid.\r\n\r\nThe look which I received from the policeman convinced me that my ears\r\nhad not played me false.\r\n\r\n"The lady\'s right," he declared; and pushing by me quite\r\ndisrespectfully, he led the way to the basement door, into which he and\r\nthe so-called cleaner presently disappeared.\r\n\r\nI waited in front. I felt it to be my duty to do so. The various\r\npassers-by stopped an instant to stare at me before proceeding on their\r\nway, but I did not flinch from my post. Not till I had heard that the\r\nyoung woman whom I had seen enter these doors at midnight was well, and\r\nthat her delay in opening the windows was entirely due to fashionable\r\nlaziness, would I feel justified in returning to my own home and its\r\naffairs. But it took patience and some courage to remain there. Several\r\nminutes elapsed before I perceived the shutters in the third story open,\r\nand a still longer time before a window on the second floor flew up and\r\nthe policeman looked out, only to meet my inquiring gaze and rapidly\r\ndisappear again.\r\n\r\nMeantime three or four persons had stopped on the walk near me, the\r\nnucleus of a crowd which would not be long in collecting, and I was\r\nbeginning to feel I was paying dearly for my virtuous resolution, when\r\nthe front door burst violently open and we caught sight of the trembling\r\nform and shocked face of the scrub-woman.\r\n\r\n"She\'s dead!" she cried, "she\'s dead! Murder!" and would have said more\r\nhad not the policeman pulled her back, with a growl which sounded very\r\nmuch like a suppressed oath.\r\n\r\nHe would have shut the door upon me had I not been quicker than\r\nlightning. As it was, I got in before it slammed, and happily too; for\r\njust at that moment the house-cleaner, who had grown paler every\r\ninstant, fell in a heap in the entry, and the policeman, who was not the\r\nman I would want about me in any trouble, seemed somewhat embarrassed by\r\nthis new emergency, and let me lift the poor thing up and drag her\r\nfarther into the hall.\r\n\r\nShe had fainted, and should have had something done for her, but anxious\r\nthough I always am to be of help where help is needed, I had no sooner\r\ngot within range of the parlor door with my burden, than I beheld a\r\nsight so terrifying that I involuntarily let the poor woman slip from my\r\narms to the floor.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness of a dim corner (for the room had no light save that\r\nwhich came through the doorway where I stood) lay the form of a woman\r\nunder a fallen piece of furniture. Her skirts and distended arms alone\r\nwere visible; but no one who saw the rigid outlines of her limbs could\r\ndoubt for a moment that she was dead.\r\n\r\nAt a sight so dreadful, and, in spite of all my apprehensions, so\r\nunexpected, I felt a sensation of sickness which in another moment might\r\nhave ended in my fainting also, if I had not realized that it would\r\nnever do for me to lose my wits in the presence of a man who had none\r\ntoo many of his own. So I shook off my momentary weakness, and turning\r\nto the policeman, who was hesitating between the unconscious figure of\r\nthe woman outside the door and the dead form of the one within I cried\r\nsharply:\r\n\r\n"Come, man, to business! The woman inside there is dead, but this one is\r\nliving. Fetch me a pitcher of water from below if you can, and then go\r\nfor whatever assistance you need. I\'ll wait here and bring this woman\r\nto. She is a strong one, and it won\'t take long."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll stay here alone with that----" he began.\r\n\r\nBut I stopped him with a look of disdain.\r\n\r\n"Of course I will stay here; why not? Is there anything in the dead to\r\nbe afraid of? Save me from the living, and I undertake to save myself\r\nfrom the dead."\r\n\r\nBut his face had grown very suspicious.\r\n\r\n"You go for the water," he cried. "And see here! Just call out for some\r\none to telephone to Police Headquarters for the Coroner and a\r\ndetective. I don\'t quit this room till one or the other of them comes."\r\n\r\nSmiling at a caution so very ill-timed, but abiding by my invariable\r\nrule of never arguing with a man unless I see some way of getting the\r\nbetter of him, I did what he bade me, though I hated dreadfully to leave\r\nthe spot and its woful mystery, even for so short a time as was\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n"Run up to the second story," he called out, as I passed by the\r\nprostrate figure of the cleaner. "Tell them what you want from the\r\nwindow, or we will have the whole street in here."\r\n\r\nSo I ran up-stairs,--I had always wished to visit this house, but had\r\nnever been encouraged to do so by the Misses Van Burnam,--and making my\r\nway into the front room, the door of which stood wide open, I rushed to\r\nthe window and hailed the crowd, which by this time extended far out\r\nbeyond the curb-stone.\r\n\r\n"An officer!" I called out, "a police officer! An accident has occurred\r\nand the man in charge here wants the Coroner and a detective from Police\r\nHeadquarters."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s hurt?" "Is it a man?" "Is it a woman?" shouted up one or two; and\r\n"Let us in!" shouted others; but the sight of a boy rushing off to meet\r\nan advancing policeman satisfied me that help would soon be forthcoming,\r\nso I drew in my head and looked about me for the next necessity--water.\r\n\r\nI was in a lady\'s bed-chamber, probably that of the eldest Miss Van\r\nBurnam; but it was a bed-chamber which had not been occupied for some\r\nmonths, and naturally it lacked the very articles which would have been\r\nof assistance to me in the present emergency. No _eau de Cologne_ on\r\nthe bureau, no camphor on the mantel-shelf. But there was water in the\r\npipes (something I had hardly hoped for), and a mug on the wash-stand;\r\nso I filled the mug and ran with it to the door, stumbling, as I did so,\r\nover some small object which I presently perceived to be a little round\r\npin-cushion. Picking it up, for I hate anything like disorder, I placed\r\nit on a table near by, and continued on my way.\r\n\r\nThe woman was still lying at the foot of the stairs. I dashed the water\r\nin her face and she immediately came to.\r\n\r\nSitting up, she was about to open her lips when she checked herself; a\r\nfact which struck me as odd, though I did not allow my surprise to\r\nbecome apparent.\r\n\r\nMeantime I stole a glance into the parlor. The officer was standing\r\nwhere I had left him, looking down on the prostrate figure before him.\r\n\r\nThere was no sign of feeling in his heavy countenance, and he had not\r\nopened a shutter, nor, so far as I could see, disarranged an object in\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious character of the whole affair fascinated me in spite of\r\nmyself, and leaving the now fully aroused woman in the hall, I was\r\nhalf-way across the parlor floor when the latter stopped me with a\r\nshrill cry:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t leave me! I have never seen anything before so horrible. The poor\r\ndear! The poor dear! Why don\'t he take those dreadful things off her?"\r\n\r\nShe alluded not only to the piece of furniture which had fallen upon the\r\nprostrate woman, and which can best be described as a cabinet with\r\nclosets below and shelves above, but to the various articles of\r\n_bric-\xe0-brac_ which had tumbled from the shelves, and which now lay in\r\nbroken pieces about her.\r\n\r\n"He will do so; they will do so very soon," I replied. "He is waiting\r\nfor some one with more authority than himself; for the Coroner, if you\r\nknow what that means."\r\n\r\n"But what if she\'s alive! Those things will crush her. Let us take them\r\noff. I\'ll help. I\'m not too weak to help."\r\n\r\n"Do you know who this person is?" I asked, for her voice had more\r\nfeeling in it than I thought natural to the occasion, dreadful as it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n"I?" she repeated, her weak eyelids quivering for a moment as she tried\r\nto sustain my scrutiny. "How should I know? I came in with the policeman\r\nand haven\'t been any nearer than I now be. What makes you think I know\r\nanything about her? I\'m only the scrub-woman, and don\'t even know the\r\nnames of the family."\r\n\r\n"I thought you seemed so very anxious," I explained, suspicious of her\r\nsuspiciousness, which was of so sly and emphatic a character that it\r\nchanged her whole bearing from one of fear to one of cunning in a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n"And who wouldn\'t feel the like of that for a poor creature lying\r\ncrushed under a heap of broken crockery!"\r\n\r\nCrockery! those Japanese vases worth hundreds of dollars! that ormulu\r\nclock and those Dresden figures which must have been more than a couple\r\nof centuries old!\r\n\r\n"It\'s a poor sense of duty that keeps a man standing dumb and staring\r\nlike that, when with a lift of his hand he could show us the like of\r\nher pretty face, and if it\'s dead she be or alive."\r\n\r\nAs this burst of indignation was natural enough and not altogether\r\nuncalled for from the standpoint of humanity, I gave the woman a nod of\r\napproval, and wished I were a man myself that I might lift the heavy\r\ncabinet or whatever it was that lay upon the poor creature before us.\r\nBut not being a man, and not judging it wise to irritate the one\r\nrepresentative of that sex then present, I made no remark, but only took\r\na few steps farther into the room, followed, as it afterwards appeared,\r\nby the scrub-woman.\r\n\r\nThe Van Burnam parlors are separated by an open arch. It was to the\r\nright of this arch and in the corner opposite the doorway that the dead\r\nwoman lay. Using my eyes, now that I was somewhat accustomed to the\r\nsemi-darkness enveloping us, I noticed two or three facts which had\r\nhitherto escaped me. One was, that she lay on her back with her feet\r\npointing towards the hall door, and another, that nowhere in the room,\r\nsave in her immediate vicinity, were there to be seen any signs of\r\nstruggle or disorder. All was as set and proper as in my own parlor when\r\nit has been undisturbed for any length of time by guests; and though I\r\ncould not see far into the rooms beyond, they were to all appearance in\r\nan equally orderly condition.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the cleaner was trying to account for the overturned cabinet.\r\n\r\n"Poor dear! poor dear! she must have pulled it over on herself! But\r\nhowever did she get into the house? And what was she doing in this great\r\nempty place?"\r\n\r\nThe policeman, to whom these remarks had evidently been addressed,\r\ngrowled out some unintelligible reply, and in her perplexity the woman\r\nturned towards me.\r\n\r\nBut what could I say to her? I had my own private knowledge of the\r\nmatter, but she was not one to confide in, so I stoically shook my head.\r\nDoubly disappointed, the poor thing shrank back, after looking first at\r\nthe policeman and then at me in an odd, appealing way, difficult to\r\nunderstand. Then her eyes fell again on the dead girl at her feet, and\r\nbeing nearer now than before, she evidently saw something that startled\r\nher, for she sank on her knees with a little cry and began examining the\r\ngirl\'s skirts.\r\n\r\n"What are you looking at there?" growled the policeman. "Get up, can\'t\r\nyou! No one but the Coroner has right to lay hand on anything here."\r\n\r\n"I\'m doing no harm," the woman protested, in an odd, shaking voice. "I\r\nonly wanted to see what the poor thing had on. Some blue stuff, isn\'t\r\nit?" she asked me.\r\n\r\n"Blue serge," I answered; "store-made, but very good; must have come\r\nfrom Altman\'s or Stern\'s."\r\n\r\n"I--I\'m not used to sights like this," stammered the scrub-woman,\r\nstumbling awkwardly to her feet, and looking as if her few remaining\r\nwits had followed the rest on an endless vacation. "I--I think I shall\r\nhave to go home." But she did not move.\r\n\r\n"The poor dear\'s young, isn\'t she?" she presently insinuated, with an\r\nodd catch in her voice that gave to the question an air of hesitation\r\nand doubt.\r\n\r\n"I think she is younger than either you or myself," I deigned to reply.\r\n"Her narrow pointed shoes show she has not reached the years of\r\ndiscretion."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, so they do!" ejaculated the cleaner, eagerly--too eagerly\r\nfor perfect ingenuousness. "That\'s why I said \'Poor dear!\' and spoke of\r\nher pretty face. I am sorry for young folks when they get into trouble,\r\naint you? You and me might lie here and no one be much the worse for it,\r\nbut a sweet lady like this----"\r\n\r\nThis was not very flattering to me, but I was prevented from rebuking\r\nher by a prolonged shout from the stoop without, as a rush was made\r\nagainst the front door, followed by a shrill peal of the bell.\r\n\r\n"Man from Headquarters," stolidly announced the policeman. "Open the\r\ndoor, ma\'am; or step back into the further hall if you want me to do\r\nit."\r\n\r\nSuch rudeness was uncalled for; but considering myself too important a\r\nwitness to show feeling, I swallowed my indignation and proceeded with\r\nall my native dignity to the front door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I did so, I could catch the murmur of the crowd outside as it seethed\r\nforward at the first intimation of the door being opened; but my\r\nattention was not so distracted by it, loud as it sounded after the\r\nquiet of the shut-up house, that I failed to notice that the door had\r\nnot been locked by the gentleman leaving the night before, and that,\r\nconsequently, only the night latch was on. With a turn of the knob it\r\nopened, showing me the mob of shouting boys and the forms of two\r\ngentlemen awaiting admittance on the door-step. I frowned at the mob and\r\nsmiled on the gentlemen, one of whom was portly and easy-going in\r\nappearance, and the other spare, with a touch of severity in his aspect.\r\nBut for some reason these gentlemen did not seem to appreciate the honor\r\nI had done them, for they both gave me a displeased glance, which was so\r\nodd and unsympathetic in its character that I bridled a little, though I\r\nsoon returned to my natural manner. Did they realize at the first glance\r\nthat I was destined to prove a thorn in the sides of every one connected\r\nwith this matter, for days to come?\r\n\r\n"Are you the woman who called from the window?" asked the larger of the\r\ntwo, whose business here I found it difficult at first to determine.\r\n\r\n"I am," was my perfectly self-possessed reply. "I live next door and my\r\npresence here is due to the anxious interest I always take in my\r\nneighbors. I had reason to think that all was not as it should be in\r\nthis house, and I was right. Look in the parlor, sirs."\r\n\r\nThey were already as far as the threshold of that room and needed no\r\nfurther encouragement to enter. The heavier man went first and the other\r\nfollowed, and you may be sure I was not far behind. The sight meeting\r\nour eyes was ghastly enough, as you know; but these men were evidently\r\naccustomed to ghastly sights, for they showed but little emotion.\r\n\r\n"I thought this house was empty," observed the second gentleman, who was\r\nevidently a doctor.\r\n\r\n"So it was till last night," I put in; and was about to tell my story,\r\nwhen I felt my skirts jerked.\r\n\r\nTurning, I found that this warning had come from the cleaner who stood\r\nclose beside me.\r\n\r\n"What do you want?" I asked, not understanding her and having nothing to\r\nconceal.\r\n\r\n"I?" she faltered, with a frightened air. "Nothing, ma\'am, nothing."\r\n\r\n"Then don\'t interrupt me," I harshly admonished her, annoyed at an\r\ninterference that tended to throw suspicion upon my candor. "This woman\r\ncame here to scrub and clean," I now explained; "it was by means of the\r\nkey she carried that we were enabled to get into the house. I never\r\nspoke to her till a half hour ago."\r\n\r\nAt which, with a display of subtlety I was far from expecting in one of\r\nher appearance, she let her emotions take a fresh direction, and\r\npointing towards the dead woman, she impetuously cried:\r\n\r\n"But the poor child there! Aint you going to take those things off of\r\nher? It\'s wicked to leave her under all that stuff. Suppose there was\r\nlife in her!"\r\n\r\n"Oh! there\'s no hope of that," muttered the doctor, lifting one of the\r\nhands, and letting it fall again.\r\n\r\n"Still--" he cast a side look at his companion, who gave him a meaning\r\nnod--"it might be well enough to lift this cabinet sufficiently for me\r\nto lay my hand on her heart."\r\n\r\nThey accordingly did this; and the doctor, leaning down, placed his hand\r\nover the poor bruised breast.\r\n\r\n"No life," he murmured. "She has been dead some hours. Do you think we\r\nhad better release the head?" he went on, glancing up at the portly man\r\nat his side.\r\n\r\nBut the latter, who was rapidly growing serious, made a slight protest\r\nwith his finger, and turning to me, inquired, with sudden authority:\r\n\r\n"What did you mean when you said that the house had been empty till last\r\nnight?"\r\n\r\n"Just what I said, sir. It was empty till about midnight, when two\r\npersons----" Again I felt my dress twitched, this time very cautiously.\r\nWhat did the woman want? Not daring to give her a look, for these men\r\nwere only too ready to detect harm in everything I did, I gently drew my\r\nskirt away and took a step aside, going on as if no interruption had\r\noccurred. "Did I say persons? I should have said a man and a woman drove\r\nup to the house and entered. I saw them from my window."\r\n\r\n"You did?" murmured my interlocutor, whom I had by this time decided to\r\nbe a detective. "And this is the woman, I suppose?" he proceeded,\r\npointing to the poor creature lying before us.\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, of course. Who else can she be? I did not see the lady\'s face\r\nlast night, but she was young and light on her feet, and ran up the\r\nstoop gaily."\r\n\r\n"And the man? Where is the man? I don\'t see him here."\r\n\r\n"I am not surprised at that. He went very soon after he came, not ten\r\nminutes after, I should say. That is what alarmed me and caused me to\r\nhave the house investigated. It did not seem natural or like any of the\r\nVan Burnams to leave a woman to spend the night in so large a house\r\nalone."\r\n\r\n"You know the Van Burnams?"\r\n\r\n"Not well. But that don\'t signify. I know what report says of them; they\r\nare gentlemen."\r\n\r\n"But Mr. Van Burnam is in Europe."\r\n\r\n"He has two sons."\r\n\r\n"Living here?"\r\n\r\n"No; the unmarried one spends his nights at Long Branch, and the other\r\nis with his wife somewhere in Connecticut."\r\n\r\n"How did the young couple you saw get in last night? Was there any one\r\nhere to admit them?"\r\n\r\n"No; the gentleman had a key."\r\n\r\n"Ah, he had a key."\r\n\r\nThe tone in which this was said recurred to me afterwards, but at the\r\nmoment I was much more impressed by a peculiar sound I heard behind me,\r\nsomething between a gasp and a click in the throat, which came I knew\r\nfrom the scrub-woman, and which, odd and contradictory as it may appear,\r\nstruck me as an expression of satisfaction, though what there was in my\r\nadmission to give satisfaction to this poor creature I could not\r\nconjecture. Moving so as to get a glimpse of her face, I went on with\r\nthe grim self-possession natural to my character:\r\n\r\n"And when he came out he walked briskly away. The carriage had not\r\nwaited for him."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" again muttered the gentleman, picking up one of the broken pieces\r\nof china which lay haphazard about the floor, while I studied the\r\ncleaner\'s face, which, to my amazement, gave evidences of a confusion of\r\nemotions most unaccountable to me.\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce may have noticed this too, for he immediately addressed her,\r\nthough he continued to look at the broken piece of china in his hand.\r\n\r\n"And how come you to be cleaning the house?" he asked. "Is the family\r\ncoming home?"\r\n\r\n"They are, sir," she answered, hiding her emotion with great skill the\r\nmoment she perceived attention directed to herself, and speaking with a\r\nsudden volubility that made us all stare. "They are expected any day. I\r\ndidn\'t know it till yesterday--was it yesterday? No, the day\r\nbefore--when young Mr. Franklin--he is the oldest son, sir, and a very\r\nnice man, a _very_ nice man--sent me word by letter that I was to get\r\nthe house ready. It isn\'t the first time I have done it for them, sir,\r\nand as soon as I could get the basement key from the agent, I came here,\r\nand worked all day yesterday, washing up the floors and dusting. I\r\nshould have been at them again this morning if my husband hadn\'t been\r\nsick. But I had to go to the infirmary for medicine, and it was noon\r\nwhen I got here, and then I found this lady standing outside with a\r\npoliceman, a very nice lady, a very _nice_ lady indeed, sir, I pay my\r\nrespects to her"--and she actually dropped me a curtsey like a peasant\r\nwoman in a play--"and they took my key from me, and the policeman opens\r\nthe door, and he and me go upstairs and into all the rooms, and when we\r\ncome to this one----"\r\n\r\nShe was getting so excited as to be hardly intelligible. Stopping\r\nherself with a jerk, she fumbled nervously with her apron, while I asked\r\nmyself how she could have been at work in this house the day before\r\nwithout my knowing it. Suddenly I remembered that I was ill in the\r\nmorning and busy in the afternoon at the Orphan Asylum, and somewhat\r\nrelieved at finding so excellent an excuse for my ignorance, I looked up\r\nto see if the detective had noticed anything odd in this woman\'s\r\nbehavior. Presumably he had, but having more experience than myself with\r\nthe susceptibility of ignorant persons in the presence of danger and\r\ndistress, he attached less importance to it than I did, for which I was\r\nsecretly glad, without exactly knowing my reasons for being so.\r\n\r\n"You will be wanted as a witness by the Coroner\'s jury," he now remarked\r\nto her, looking as if he were addressing the piece of china he was\r\nturning over in his hand. "Now, no nonsense!" he protested, as she\r\ncommenced to tremble and plead. "You were the first one to see this dead\r\nwoman, and you must be on hand to say so. As I cannot tell you when the\r\ninquest will be held, you had better stay around till the Coroner comes.\r\nHe\'ll be here soon. You, and this other woman too."\r\n\r\nBy other woman he meant _me_, Miss Butterworth, of Colonial ancestry and\r\nno inconsiderable importance in the social world. But though I did not\r\nrelish this careless association of myself with this poor scrub-woman,\r\nI was careful to show no displeasure, for I reasoned that as witnesses\r\nwe were equal before the law, and that it was solely in this light he\r\nregarded us.\r\n\r\nThere was something in the manner of both these gentlemen which\r\nconvinced me that while my presence was considered desirable in the\r\nhouse, it was not especially wanted in the room. I was therefore moving\r\nreluctantly away, when I felt a slight but peremptory touch on the arm,\r\nand turning, saw the detective at my side, still studying his piece of\r\nchina.\r\n\r\nHe was, as I have said, of portly build and benevolent aspect; a\r\nfatherly-looking man, and not at all the person one would be likely to\r\nassociate with the police. Yet he could take the lead very naturally,\r\nand when he spoke, I felt bound to answer him.\r\n\r\n"Will you be so good, madam, as to relate over again, what you saw from\r\nyour window last night? I am likely to have charge of this matter, and\r\nwould be pleased to hear all you may have to say concerning it."\r\n\r\n"My name is Butterworth," I politely intimated.\r\n\r\n"And my name is Gryce."\r\n\r\n"A detective?"\r\n\r\n"The same."\r\n\r\n"You must think this matter very serious," I ventured.\r\n\r\n"Death by violence is always serious."\r\n\r\n"You must regard this death as something more than an accident, I mean."\r\n\r\nHis smile seemed to say: "You will not know to-day how I regard it."\r\n\r\n"And you will not know to-day what I think of it either," was my inward\r\nrejoinder, but I said nothing aloud, for the man was seventy-five if he\r\nwas a day, and I have been taught respect for age, and have practised\r\nthe same for fifty years and more.\r\n\r\nI must have shown what was passing in my mind, and he must have seen it\r\nreflected on the polished surface of the porcelain he was contemplating,\r\nfor his lips showed the shadow of a smile sufficiently sarcastic for me\r\nto see that he was far from being as easy-natured as his countenance\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\n"Come, come," said he, "there is the Coroner now. Say what you have to\r\nsay, like the straightforward, honest woman you appear."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like compliments," I snapped out. Indeed, they have always been\r\nobnoxious to me. As if there was any merit in being honest and\r\nstraightforward, or any distinction in being told so!\r\n\r\n"I am Miss Butterworth, and not in the habit of being spoken to as if I\r\nwere a simple countrywoman," I objected. "But I will repeat what I saw\r\nlast night, as it is no secret, and the telling of it won\'t hurt me and\r\nmay help you."\r\n\r\nAccordingly I went over the whole story, and was much more loquacious\r\nthan I had intended to be, his manner was so insinuating and his\r\ninquiries so pertinent. But one topic we both failed to broach, and that\r\nwas the peculiar manner of the scrub-woman. Perhaps it had not struck\r\nhim as peculiar and perhaps it should not have struck me so, but in the\r\nsilence which was preserved on the subject I felt I had acquired an\r\nadvantage over him, which might lead to consequences of no small\r\nimportance. Would I have felt thus or congratulated myself quite so much\r\nupon my fancied superiority, if I had known he was the man who managed\r\nthe Leavenworth case, and who in his early years had experienced that\r\nvery wonderful adventure on the staircase of the Heart\'s Delight?\r\nPerhaps I would; for though I have had no adventures, I feel capable of\r\nthem, and as for any peculiar acumen he may have shown in his long and\r\neventful career, why that is a quality which others may share with him,\r\nas I hope to be able to prove before finishing these pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nAMELIA DISCOVERS HERSELF.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a small room at the extremity of the Van Burnam mansion. In\r\nthis I took refuge after my interview with Mr. Gryce. As I picked out\r\nthe chair which best suited me and settled myself for a comfortable\r\ncommunion with my own thoughts, I was astonished to find how much I was\r\nenjoying myself, notwithstanding the thousand and one duties awaiting me\r\non the other side of the party-wall.\r\n\r\nEven this very solitude was welcome, for it gave me an opportunity to\r\nconsider matters. I had not known up to this very hour that I had any\r\nspecial gifts. My father, who was a shrewd man of the old New England\r\ntype, said more times than I am years old (which was not saying it as\r\noften as some may think) that Araminta (the name I was christened by,\r\nand the name you will find in the Bible record, though I sign myself\r\nAmelia, and insist upon being addressed as Amelia, being, as I hope, a\r\nsensible woman and not the piece of antiquated sentimentality suggested\r\nby the former cognomen)--that Araminta would live to make her mark;\r\nthough in what capacity he never informed me, being, as I have observed,\r\na shrewd man, and thus not likely to thoughtlessly commit himself.\r\n\r\nI now know he was right; my pretensions dating from the moment I found\r\nthat this affair, at first glance so simple, and at the next so\r\ncomplicated, had aroused in me a fever of investigation which no\r\nreasoning could allay. Though I had other and more personal matters on\r\nmy mind, my thoughts would rest nowhere but on the details of this\r\ntragedy; and having, as I thought, noticed some few facts in connection\r\nwith it, from which conclusions might be drawn, I amused myself with\r\njotting them down on the back of a disputed grocer\'s bill I happened to\r\nfind in my pocket.\r\n\r\nValueless as explaining this tragedy, being founded upon insufficient\r\nevidence, they may be interesting as showing the workings of my mind\r\neven at this early stage of the matter. They were drawn up under three\r\nheads.\r\n\r\nFirst, was the death of this young woman an accident?\r\n\r\nSecond, was it a suicide?\r\n\r\nThird, was it a murder?\r\n\r\nUnder the first head I wrote:\r\n\r\n_My reasons for not thinking it an accident._\r\n\r\n1. If it had been an accident and she had pulled the cabinet over upon\r\nherself, she would have been found with her feet pointing towards the\r\nwall where the cabinet had stood.\r\n\r\n(But her feet were towards the door and her head under the cabinet.)\r\n\r\n2. The decent, even precise, arrangement of the clothing about her feet,\r\nwhich precludes any theory involving accident.\r\n\r\nUnder the second:\r\n\r\n_Reason for not thinking it suicide._\r\n\r\nShe could not have been found in the position observed without having\r\nlain down on the floor while living and then pulled the shelves down\r\nupon herself.\r\n\r\n(A theory obviously too improbable to be considered.)\r\n\r\nUnder the third:\r\n\r\n_Reason for not thinking it murder._\r\n\r\nShe would need to have been held down on the floor while the cabinet was\r\nbeing pulled over on her; something which the quiet aspect of the hands\r\nand feet made appear impossible.\r\n\r\nTo this I added:\r\n\r\n_Reasons for accepting the theory of murder._\r\n\r\n1. The fact that she did not go into the house alone; that a man entered\r\nwith her, remained ten minutes, and then came out again and disappeared\r\nup the street with every appearance of haste and an anxious desire to\r\nleave the spot.\r\n\r\n2. The front door, which he had unlocked on entering, was not locked by\r\nhim on his departure, the catch doing the locking. Yet, though he could\r\nhave re-entered so easily, he had shown no disposition to return.\r\n\r\n3. The arrangement of the skirts, which show the touch of a careful hand\r\nafter death.\r\n\r\nNothing clear, you see. I was doubtful of all; and yet my suspicions\r\ntended most toward murder.\r\n\r\nI had eaten my luncheon before interfering in this matter, which was\r\nfortunate for me, as it was three o\'clock before I was summoned to meet\r\nthe Coroner, of whose arrival I had been conscious some time before.\r\n\r\nHe was in the front parlor where the dead girl lay, and as I took my way\r\nthither I felt the same sensations of faintness which had so nearly\r\novercome me on the previous occasion. But I mastered them, and was\r\nquite myself before I crossed the threshold.\r\n\r\nThere were several gentlemen present, but of them all I only noticed\r\ntwo, one of whom I took to be the Coroner, while the other was my late\r\ninterlocutor, Mr. Gryce. From the animation observable in the latter, I\r\ngathered that the case was growing in interest from the detective\r\nstandpoint.\r\n\r\n"Ah, and is this the witness?" asked the Coroner, as I stepped into the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"I am Miss Butterworth," was my calm reply. "_Amelia_ Butterworth.\r\nLiving next door and present at the discovery of this poor murdered\r\nbody."\r\n\r\n"Murdered," he repeated. "Why do you say murdered?"\r\n\r\nFor reply I drew from my pocket the bill on which I had scribbled my\r\nconclusions in regard to this matter.\r\n\r\n"Read this," said I.\r\n\r\nEvidently astonished, he took the paper from my hand, and, after some\r\ncurious glances in my direction, condescended to do as I requested. The\r\nresult was an odd but grudging look of admiration directed towards\r\nmyself and a quick passing over of the paper to the detective.\r\n\r\nThe latter, who had exchanged his bit of broken china for a very much\r\nused and tooth-marked lead-pencil, frowned with a whimsical air at the\r\nlatter before he put it in his pocket. Then he read my hurried scrawl.\r\n\r\n"Two Richmonds in the field!" commented the Coroner, with a sly chuckle.\r\n"I am afraid I shall have to yield to their allied forces. Miss\r\nButterworth, the cabinet is about to be raised; do you feel as if you\r\ncould endure the sight?"\r\n\r\n"I can stand anything where the cause of justice is involved," I\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n"Very well, then, sit down, if you please. When the whole body is\r\nvisible I will call you."\r\n\r\nAnd stepping forward he gave orders to have the clock and broken china\r\nremoved from about the body.\r\n\r\nAs the former was laid away on one end of the mantel some one observed:\r\n\r\n"What a valuable witness that clock might have been had it been running\r\nwhen the shelves fell!"\r\n\r\nBut the fact was so patent that it had not been in motion for months\r\nthat no one even answered; and Mr. Gryce did not so much as look towards\r\nit. But then we had all seen that the hands stood at three minutes to\r\nfive.\r\n\r\nI had been asked to sit down, but I found this impossible. Side by side\r\nwith the detective, I viewed the replacing of that heavy piece of\r\nfurniture against the wall, and the slow disclosure of the upper part of\r\nthe body which had so long lain hidden.\r\n\r\nThat I did not give way is a proof that my father\'s prophecy was not\r\nwithout some reasonable foundation; for the sight was one to try the\r\nstoutest nerves, as well as to awaken the compassion of the hardest\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nThe Coroner, meeting my eye, pointed at the poor creature inquiringly.\r\n\r\n"Is this the woman you saw enter here last night?"\r\n\r\nI glanced down at her dress, noted the short summer cape tied to the\r\nneck with an elaborate bow of ribbon, and nodded my head.\r\n\r\n"I remember the cape," said I. "But where is her hat? She wore one. Let\r\nme see if I can describe it." Closing my eyes I endeavored to recall\r\nthe dim silhouette of her figure as she stood passing up the change to\r\nthe driver; and was so far successful that I was ready to announce at\r\nthe next moment that her hat presented the effect of a soft felt with\r\none feather or one bow of ribbon standing upright from the side of the\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\n"Then the identity of this woman with the one you saw enter here last\r\nnight is established," remarked the detective, stooping down and drawing\r\nfrom under the poor girl\'s body a hat, sufficiently like the one I had\r\njust described, to satisfy everybody that it was the same.\r\n\r\n"As if there could be any doubt," I began.\r\n\r\nBut the Coroner, explaining that it was a mere formality, motioned me to\r\nstand aside in favor of the doctor, who seemed anxious to approach\r\nnearer the spot where the dead woman lay. This I was about to do when a\r\nsudden thought struck me, and I reached out my hand for the hat.\r\n\r\n"Let me look at it for a moment," said I.\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce at once handed it over, and I took a good look at it inside\r\nand out.\r\n\r\n"It is pretty badly crushed," I observed, "and does not present a very\r\nfresh appearance, but for all that it has been worn but once."\r\n\r\n"How do you know?" questioned the Coroner.\r\n\r\n"Let the other Richmond inform you," was my grimly uttered reply, as I\r\ngave it again into the detective\'s hand.\r\n\r\nThere was a murmur about me, whether of amusement or displeasure, I made\r\nno effort to decide. I was finding out something for myself, and I did\r\nnot care what they thought of me.\r\n\r\n"Neither has she worn this dress long," I continued; "but that is not\r\ntrue of the shoes. They are not old, but they have been acquainted with\r\nthe pavement, and that is more than can be said of the hem of this gown.\r\nThere are no gloves on her hands; a few minutes elapsed then before the\r\nassault; long enough for her to take them off."\r\n\r\n"Smart woman!" whispered a voice in my ear; a half-admiring,\r\nhalf-sarcastic voice that I had no difficulty in ascribing to Mr. Gryce.\r\n"But are you sure she wore any? Did you notice that her hand was gloved\r\nwhen she came into the house?"\r\n\r\n"No," I answered, frankly; "but so well-dressed a woman would not enter\r\na house like this, without gloves."\r\n\r\n"It was a warm night," some one suggested.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care. You will find her gloves as you have her hat; and you\r\nwill find them with the fingers turned inside out, just as she drew them\r\nfrom her hand. So much I will concede to the warmth of the weather."\r\n\r\n"Like these, for instance," broke in a quiet voice.\r\n\r\nStartled, for a hand had appeared over my shoulder dangling a pair of\r\ngloves before my eyes, I cried out, somewhat too triumphantly I own:\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, just like those! Did you pick them up here? Are they hers?"\r\n\r\n"You say that this is the way hers should look."\r\n\r\n"And I repeat it."\r\n\r\n"Then allow me to pay you my compliments. These were picked up here."\r\n\r\n"But where?" I cried. "I thought I had looked this carpet well over."\r\n\r\nHe smiled, not at me but at the gloves, and the thought crossed me that\r\nhe felt as if something more than the gloves was being turned inside\r\nout. I therefore pursed my mouth, and determined to stand more on my\r\nguard.\r\n\r\n"It is of no consequence," I assured him; "all such matters will come\r\nout at the inquest."\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce nodded, and put the gloves back in his pocket. With them he\r\nseemed to pocket some of his geniality and patience.\r\n\r\n"All these facts have been gone over before you came in," said he, which\r\nstatement I beg to consider as open to doubt.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, who had hardly moved a muscle during all this colloquy, now\r\nrose from his kneeling position beside the girl\'s head.\r\n\r\n"I shall have to ask the presence of another physician," said he. "Will\r\nyou send for one from your office, Coroner Dahl?"\r\n\r\nAt which I stepped back and the Coroner stepped forward, saying,\r\nhowever, as he passed me:\r\n\r\n"The inquest will be held day after to-morrow in my office. Hold\r\nyourself in readiness to be present. I regard you as one of my chief\r\nwitnesses."\r\n\r\nI assured him I would be on hand, and, obeying a gesture of his finger,\r\nretreated from the room; but I did not yet leave the house. A straight,\r\nslim man, with a very small head but a very bright eye, was leaning on\r\nthe newel-post in the front hall, and when he saw me, started up so\r\nalertly I perceived that he had business with me, and so waited for him\r\nto speak.\r\n\r\n"You are Miss Butterworth?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"I am, sir."\r\n\r\n"And I am a reporter from the New York _World_. Will you allow me----"\r\n\r\nWhy did he stop? I had merely looked at him. But he did stop, and that\r\nis saying considerable for a reporter from the New York _World_.\r\n\r\n"I certainly am willing to tell you what I have told every one else," I\r\ninterposed, considering it better not to make an enemy of so judicious a\r\nyoung man; and seeing him brighten up at this, I thereupon related all I\r\nconsidered desirable for the general public to know.\r\n\r\nI was about passing on, when, reflecting that one good turn deserves\r\nanother, I paused and asked him if he thought they would leave the dead\r\ngirl in that house all night.\r\n\r\nHe answered that he did not think they would. That a telegram had been\r\nsent some time before to young Mr. Van Burnam, and that they were only\r\nawaiting his arrival to remove her.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean Howard?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Is he the elder one?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"It is the elder one they have summoned; the one who has been staying at\r\nLong Branch."\r\n\r\n"How can they expect him then so soon?"\r\n\r\n"Because he is in the city. It seems the old gentleman is going to\r\nreturn on the _New York_, and as she is due here to-day, Franklin Van\r\nBurnam has come to New York to meet him."\r\n\r\n"Humph!" thought I, "lively times are in prospect," and for the first\r\ntime I remembered my dinner and the orders which had not been given\r\nabout some curtains which were to have been hung that day, and all the\r\nother reasons I had for being at home.\r\n\r\nI must have shown my feelings, much as I pride myself upon my\r\nimpassibility upon all occasions, for he immediately held out his arm,\r\nwith an offer to pilot me through the crowd to my own house; and I was\r\nabout to accept it when the door-bell rang so sharply that we\r\ninvoluntarily stopped.\r\n\r\n"A fresh witness or a telegram for the Coroner," whispered the reporter\r\nin my ear.\r\n\r\nI tried to look indifferent, and doubtless made out pretty well, for he\r\nadded, after a sly look in my face:\r\n\r\n"You do not care to stay any longer?"\r\n\r\nI made no reply, but I think he was impressed by my dignity. Could he\r\nnot see that it would be the height of ill-manners for me to rush out in\r\nthe face of any one coming in?\r\n\r\nAn officer opened the door, and when we saw who stood there, I am sure\r\nthat the reporter, as well as myself, was grateful that we listened to\r\nthe dictates of politeness. It was young Mr. Van Burnam--Franklin; I\r\nmean the older and more respectable of the two sons.\r\n\r\nHe was flushed and agitated, and looked as if he would like to\r\nannihilate the crowd pushing him about on his own stoop. He gave an\r\nangry glance backward as he stepped in, and then I saw that a carriage\r\ncovered with baggage stood on the other side of the street, and gathered\r\nthat he had not returned to his father\'s house alone.\r\n\r\n"What has happened? What does all this mean?" were the words he hurled\r\nat us as the door closed behind him and he found himself face to face\r\nwith a half dozen strangers, among whom the reporter and myself stood\r\nconspicuous.\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce, coming suddenly from somewhere, was the one to answer him.\r\n\r\n"A painful occurrence, sir. A young girl has been found here, dead,\r\ncrushed under one of your parlor cabinets."\r\n\r\n"A young girl!" he repeated. (Oh, how glad I was that I had been brought\r\nup never to transgress the principles of politeness.) "Here! in this\r\nshut-up house? What young girl? You mean old woman, do you not? the\r\nhouse-cleaner or some one----"\r\n\r\n"No, Mr. Van Burnam, we mean what we say, though possibly I should call\r\nher a young lady. She is dressed quite fashionably."\r\n\r\n"The ----" Really I cannot repeat in this public manner the word which\r\nMr. Van Burnam used. I excused him at the time, but I will not\r\nperpetuate his forgetfulness in these pages.\r\n\r\n"She is still lying as we found her," Mr. Gryce now proceeded in his\r\nquiet, almost fatherly way. "Will you not take a look at her? Perhaps\r\nyou can tell us who she is?"\r\n\r\n"I?" Mr. Van Burnam seemed quite shocked. "How should I know her! Some\r\nthief probably, killed while meddling with other people\'s property."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," quoth Mr. Gryce, laconically; at which I felt so angry, as\r\ntending to mislead my handsome young neighbor, that I irresistibly did\r\nwhat I had fully made up my mind not to do, that is, stepped into view\r\nand took a part in this conversation.\r\n\r\n"How can you say that," I cried, "when her admittance here was due to a\r\nyoung man who let her in at midnight with a key, and then left her to\r\neat out her heart in this great house all alone."\r\n\r\nI have made sensations in my life, but never quite so marked a one as\r\nthis. In an instant every eye was on me, with the exception of the\r\ndetective\'s. His was on the figure crowning the newel-post, and\r\nbitterly severe his gaze was too, though it immediately grew wary as the\r\nyoung man started towards me and impetuously demanded:\r\n\r\n"Who talks like that? Why, it\'s Miss Butterworth. Madam, I fear I did\r\nnot fully understand what you said."\r\n\r\nWhereupon I repeated my words, this time very quietly but clearly, while\r\nMr. Gryce continued to frown at the bronze figure he had taken into his\r\nconfidence. When I had finished, Mr. Van Burnam\'s countenance had\r\nchanged, so had his manner. He held himself as erect as before, but not\r\nwith as much bravado. He showed haste and impatience also, but not the\r\nsame kind of haste and not quite the same kind of impatience. The\r\ncorners of Mr. Gryce\'s mouth betrayed that he noted this change, but he\r\ndid not turn away from the newel-post.\r\n\r\n"This is a remarkable circumstance which you have just told me,"\r\nobserved Mr. Van Burnam, with the first bow I had ever received from\r\nhim. "I don\'t know what to think of it. But I still hold that it\'s some\r\nthief. Killed, did you say? Really dead? Well, I\'d have given five\r\nhundred dollars not to have had it happen in this house."\r\n\r\nHe had been moving towards the parlor door, and he now entered it.\r\nInstantly Mr. Gryce was by his side.\r\n\r\n"Are they going to close the door?" I whispered to the reporter, who was\r\ntaking this all in equally with myself.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid so," he muttered.\r\n\r\nAnd they did. Mr. Gryce had evidently had enough of my interference, and\r\nwas resolved to shut me out, but I heard one word and caught one\r\nglimpse of Mr. Van Burnam\'s face before the heavy door fell to. The word\r\nwas: "Oh, so bad as that! How can any one recognize her----" And the\r\nglimpse--well, the glimpse proved to me that he was much more profoundly\r\nagitated than he wished to appear, and any extraordinary agitation on\r\nhis part was certainly in direct contradiction to the very sentence he\r\nwas at that moment uttering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nSILAS VAN BURNAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n"However much I may be needed at home, I cannot reconcile it with my\r\nsense of duty to leave just yet," I confided to the reporter, with what\r\nI meant to be a proper show of reason and self-restraint; "Mr. Van\r\nBurnam may wish to ask me some questions."\r\n\r\n"Of course, of course," acquiesced the other. "You are very right;\r\nalways are very right, I should judge."\r\n\r\nAs I did not know what he meant by this, I frowned, always a wise thing\r\nto do in an uncertainty; that is,--if one wishes to maintain an air of\r\nindependence and aversion to flattery.\r\n\r\n"Will you not sit down?" he suggested. "There is a chair at the end of\r\nthe hall."\r\n\r\nBut I had no need to sit. The front door-bell again rang, and\r\nsimultaneously with its opening, the parlor door unclosed and Mr.\r\nFranklin Van Burnam appeared in the hall, just as Mr. Silas Van Burnam,\r\nhis father, stepped into the vestibule.\r\n\r\n"Father!" he remonstrated, with a troubled air; "could you not wait?"\r\n\r\nThe elder gentleman, who had evidently just been driven up from the\r\nsteamer, wiped his forehead with an irascible air, that I will say I\r\nhad noticed in him before and on much less provocation.\r\n\r\n"Wait, with a yelling crowd screaming murder in my ear, and Isabella on\r\none side of me calling for salts, and Caroline on the opposite seat\r\ngetting that blue look about the mouth we have learned to dread so in a\r\nhot day like this? No, sir, when there is anything wrong going on I want\r\nto know it, and evidently there is something wrong going on here. What\r\nis it? Some of Howard\'s----"\r\n\r\nBut the son, seizing me by the hand and drawing me forward, put a quick\r\nstop to the old gentleman\'s sentence. "Miss Butterworth, father! Our\r\nnext-door neighbor, you know."\r\n\r\n"Ah! hum! ha! Miss Butterworth. How do you do, ma\'am? What the ---- is\r\nshe doing here?" he grumbled, not so low but that I heard both the\r\nprofanity and the none too complimentary allusion to myself.\r\n\r\n"If you will come into the parlor, I will tell you," urged the son. "But\r\nwhat have you done with Isabella and Caroline? Left them in the carriage\r\nwith that hooting mob about them?"\r\n\r\n"I told the coachman to drive on. They are probably half-way around the\r\nblock by this time."\r\n\r\n"Then come in here. But don\'t allow yourself to be too much affected by\r\nwhat you will see. A sad accident has occurred here, and you must expect\r\nthe sight of blood."\r\n\r\n"Blood! Oh, I can stand that, if Howard----"\r\n\r\nThe rest was lost in the sound of the closing door.\r\n\r\nAnd now, you will say, I ought to have gone. And you are right, but\r\nwould you have gone yourself, especially as the hall was full of people\r\nwho did not belong there?\r\n\r\nIf you would, then condemn me for lingering just a few minutes longer.\r\n\r\nThe voices in the parlor were loud, but they presently subsided; and\r\nwhen the owner of the house came out again, he had a subdued look which\r\nwas as great a contrast to his angry aspect on entering, as was the\r\nchange I had observed in his son. He was so absorbed indeed that he did\r\nnot notice me, though I stood directly in his way.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let Howard come," he was saying in a thick, low voice to his son.\r\n"Keep Howard away till we are sure----"\r\n\r\nI am confident that his son pressed his arm at this point, for he\r\nstopped short and looked about him in a blind and dazed way.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" he ejaculated, in a tone of great displeasure. "This is the woman\r\nwho saw----"\r\n\r\n"Miss Butterworth, father," the anxious voice of his son broke in.\r\n"Don\'t try to talk; such a sight is enough to unnerve any man."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," blustered the old gentleman, evidently taking some hint from\r\nthe other\'s tone or manner. "But where are the girls? They will be dead\r\nwith terror, if we don\'t relieve their minds. They got the idea it was\r\ntheir brother Howard who was hurt; and so did I, but it\'s only some\r\nwandering waif--some----"\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if he was not to be allowed to finish any of his sentences,\r\nfor Franklin interrupted him at this point to ask him what he was going\r\nto do with the girls. Certainly he could not bring them in here.\r\n\r\n"No," answered the father, but in the dreamy, inconsequential way of\r\none whose thoughts were elsewhere. "I suppose I shall have to take them\r\nto some hotel."\r\n\r\nAh, an idea! I flushed as I realized the opportunity which had come to\r\nme and had to wait a moment not to speak with too much eagerness.\r\n\r\n"Let me play the part of a neighbor," I prayed, "and accommodate the\r\nyoung ladies for the night. My house is near and quiet."\r\n\r\n"But the trouble it will involve," protested Mr. Franklin.\r\n\r\n"Is just what I need to allay my excitement," I responded. "I shall be\r\nglad to offer them rooms for the night. If they are equally glad to\r\naccept them----"\r\n\r\n"They must be!" the old gentleman declared. "I can\'t go running round\r\nwith them hunting up rooms to-night. Miss Butterworth is very good; go\r\nfind the girls, Franklin; let me have them off my mind, at least."\r\n\r\nThe young man bowed. I bowed, and was slipping at last from my place by\r\nthe stairs when, for the third time, I felt my dress twitched.\r\n\r\n"Are you going to keep to that story?" a voice whispered in my ear.\r\n"About the young man and woman coming in the night, you know."\r\n\r\n"Keep to it!" I whispered back, recognizing the scrub-woman, who had\r\nsidled up to me from some unknown quarter in the semi-darkness. "Why,\r\nit\'s true. Why shouldn\'t I keep to it."\r\n\r\nA chuckle, difficult to describe but full of meaning, shook the arm of\r\nthe woman as she pressed close to my side.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you are a good one," she said. "I didn\'t know they made \'em so\r\ngood!" And with another chuckle full of satisfaction and an odd sort of\r\nadmiration I had certainly not earned, she slid away again into the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nCertainly there was something in this woman\'s attitude towards this\r\naffair which merited attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n"THIS IS NO ONE I KNOW."\r\n\r\n\r\nI welcomed the Misses Van Burnam with just enough good-will to show that\r\nI had not been influenced by any unworthy motives in asking them to my\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nI gave them my guest-chamber, but I invited them to sit in my front room\r\nas long as there was anything interesting going on in the street. I knew\r\nthey would like to look out, and as this chamber boasts of a bay with\r\ntwo windows, we could all be accommodated. From where I sat I could now\r\nand then hear what they said, and I considered this but just, for if the\r\nyoung woman who had suffered so untimely an end was in any way connected\r\nwith them, it was certainly best that the fact should not lie concealed;\r\nand one of them, that is Isabella, is such a chatterbox.\r\n\r\nMr. Van Burnam and his son had returned next door, and so far as we\r\ncould observe from our vantage-point, preparations were being made for\r\nthe body\'s removal. As the crowd below, driven away by the policemen one\r\nminute, only to collect again in another, swayed and grumbled in a\r\ncontinual expectation that was as continually disappointed, I heard\r\nCaroline\'s voice rise in two or three short sentences.\r\n\r\n"They can\'t find Howard, or he would have been here before now. Did you\r\nsee her that time when we were coming out of Clark\'s? Fanny Preston did,\r\nand said she was pretty."\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t get a glimpse----" A shout from the street below.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t believe it," were the next words I heard, "but Franklin is\r\nawfully afraid----"\r\n\r\n"Hush! or the ogress----" I am sure I heard her say ogress; but what\r\nfollowed was drowned in another loud murmur, and I caught nothing\r\nfurther till these sentences were uttered by the trembling and\r\nover-excited Caroline: "If it is she, pa will never be the same man\r\nagain. To have her die in our house! O, there\'s Howard now!"\r\n\r\nThe interruption came quick and sharp, and it was followed by a double\r\ncry and an anxious rustle, as the two girls sprang to their feet in\r\ntheir anxiety to attract their brother\'s attention or possibly to convey\r\nhim some warning.\r\n\r\nBut I did not give much heed to them. My eyes were on the carriage in\r\nwhich Howard had arrived, and which, owing to the ambulance in front,\r\nhad stopped on the other side of the way. I was anxious to see him\r\ndescend that I might judge if his figure recalled that of the man I had\r\nseen cross the pavement the night before. But he did not descend. Just\r\nas his hand was on the carriage door, a half dozen men appeared on the\r\nadjoining stoop carrying a burden which they hastened to deposit in the\r\nambulance. He sank back when he saw it, and when his face became visible\r\nagain, it was so white it seemed to be the only face in the street,\r\nthough fifty people stood about staring at the house, at the ambulance,\r\nand at him.\r\n\r\nFranklin Van Burnam had evidently come to the door with the rest; for\r\nHoward no sooner showed his face the second time than we saw the former\r\ndash down the steps and try to part the crowd in a vain attempt to reach\r\nhis brother\'s side. Mr. Gryce was more successful. He had no difficulty\r\nin winning his way across the street, and presently I perceived him\r\nstanding near the carriage exchanging a few words with its occupant. A\r\nmoment later he drew back, and addressing the driver, jumped into the\r\ncarriage with Howard, and was speedily driven off. The ambulance\r\nfollowed and some of the crowd, and as soon as a hack could be obtained,\r\nMr. Van Burnam and his son took the same road, leaving us three women in\r\na state of suspense, which as far as one of us was concerned, ended in a\r\nnervous attack that was not unlike heart failure. I allude, of course,\r\nto Caroline, and it took Isabella and myself a good half hour to bring\r\nher back to a normal condition, and when this was done, Isabella thought\r\nit incumbent upon her to go off into hysterics, which, being but a weak\r\nsimulation of the other\'s state, I met with severity and cured with a\r\nfrown. When both were in trim again I allowed myself one remark.\r\n\r\n"One would think," said I, "that you knew the young woman who has fallen\r\nvictim to her folly next door."\r\n\r\nAt which Isabella violently shook her head and Caroline observed:\r\n\r\n"It is the excitement which has been too much for me. I am never strong,\r\nand this is such a dreadful home-welcoming. When will father and\r\nFranklin come back? It was very unkind of them to go off without one\r\nword of encouragement."\r\n\r\n"They probably did not consider the fate of this unknown woman a matter\r\nof any importance to you."\r\n\r\nThe Van Burnam girls were unlike in appearance and character, but they\r\nshowed an equal embarrassment at this, casting down their eyes and\r\nbehaving so strangely that I was driven to wonder, without any show of\r\nhysterics I am happy to say, what would be the upshot of this matter,\r\nand how far I would become involved in it before the truth came to\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nAt dinner they displayed what I should call their best society manner.\r\nSeeing this, I assumed my society manner also. It is formed on a\r\ndifferent pattern from theirs, but is fully as impressive, I judge.\r\n\r\nA most formal meal was the result. My best china was in use, but I had\r\nadded nothing to my usual course of viands. Indeed, I had abstracted\r\nsomething. An _entr\xe9e_, upon which my cook prides herself, was omitted.\r\nWas I going to allow these proud young misses to think I had exerted\r\nmyself to please them? No; rather would I have them consider me\r\nniggardly and an enemy to good living; so the _entr\xe9e_ was, as the\r\nFrench say, suppressed.\r\n\r\nIn the evening their father came in. He was looking very dejected, and\r\nhalf his bluster was gone. He held a telegram crushed in his hand, and\r\nhe talked very rapidly. But he confided none of his secrets to me, and I\r\nwas obliged to say good-night to these young ladies without knowing much\r\nmore about the matter engrossing us than when I left their house in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nBut others were not as ignorant as myself. A dramatic and highly\r\nexciting scene had taken place that evening at the undertaker\'s to which\r\nthe unknown\'s body had been removed, and as I have more than once heard\r\nit minutely described, I will endeavor to transcribe it here with all\r\nthe impartiality of an outsider.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Gryce entered the carriage in which Howard sat, he noted first,\r\nthat the young man was frightened; and secondly, that he made no effort\r\nto hide it. He had heard almost nothing from the detective. He knew that\r\nthere had been a hue and cry for him ever since noon, and that he was\r\nwanted to identify a young woman who had been found dead in his father\'s\r\nhouse, but beyond these facts he had been told little, and yet he seemed\r\nto have no curiosity nor did he venture to express any surprise. He\r\nmerely accepted the situation and was troubled by it, showing no\r\ninclination to talk till very near the end of his destination, when he\r\nsuddenly pulled himself together and ventured this question:\r\n\r\n"How did she--the young woman as you call her--kill herself?"\r\n\r\nThe detective, who in his long career among criminals and suspected\r\npersons, had seen many men and encountered many conditions, roused at\r\nthis query with much of his old spirit. Turning from the man rather than\r\ntoward him, he allowed himself a slight shrug of the shoulders as he\r\ncalmly replied:\r\n\r\n"She was found under a heavy piece of furniture; the cabinet with the\r\nvases on it, which you must remember stood at the left of the\r\nmantel-piece. It had crushed her head and breast. Quite a remarkable\r\nmeans of death, don\'t you think? There has been but one occurrence like\r\nit in my long experience."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe what you tell me," was the young man\'s astonishing\r\nreply. "You are trying to frighten me or to make game of me. No lady\r\nwould make use of any such means of death as that."\r\n\r\n"I did not say she was a lady," returned Mr. Gryce, scoring one in his\r\nmind against his unwary companion.\r\n\r\nA quiver passed down the young man\'s side where he came in contact with\r\nthe detective.\r\n\r\n"No," he muttered; "but I gathered from what you said, she was no common\r\nperson; or why," he flashed out in sudden heat, "do you require me to go\r\nwith you to see her? Have I the name of associating with any persons of\r\nthe sex who are not ladies?"\r\n\r\n"Pardon me," said Mr. Gryce, in grim delight at the prospect he saw\r\nslowly unfolding before him of one of those complicated affairs in which\r\nminds like his unconsciously revel; "I meant no insinuations. We have\r\nrequested you, as we have requested your father and brother, to\r\naccompany us to the undertaker\'s, because the identification of the\r\ncorpse is a most important point, and every formality likely to insure\r\nit must be observed."\r\n\r\n"And did not they--my father and brother, I mean--recognize her?"\r\n\r\n"It would be difficult for any one to recognize her who was not well\r\nacquainted with her."\r\n\r\nA horrified look crossed the features of Howard Van Burnam, which, if a\r\npart of his acting, showed him to have genius for his _r\xf4le_. His head\r\nsank back on the cushions of the carriage, and for a moment he closed\r\nhis eyes. When he opened them again, the carriage had stopped, and Mr.\r\nGryce, who had not noticed his emotion, of course, was looking out of\r\nthe window with his hand on the handle of the door.\r\n\r\n"Are we there already?" asked the young man, with a shudder. "I wish\r\nyou had not considered it necessary for me to see her. I shall detect\r\nnothing familiar in her, I know."\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce bowed, repeated that it was a mere formality, and followed the\r\nyoung gentleman into the building and afterwards into the room where the\r\ndead body lay. A couple of doctors and one or two officials stood about,\r\nin whose faces the young man sought for something like encouragement\r\nbefore casting his eyes in the direction indicated by the detective. But\r\nthere was little in any of these faces to calm him, and turning shortly\r\naway, he walked manfully across the room and took his stand by the\r\ndetective.\r\n\r\n"I am positive," he began, "that it is not my wife----" At this moment\r\nthe cloth that covered the body was removed, and he gave a great start\r\nof relief. "I said so," he remarked, coldly. "This is no one I know."\r\n\r\nHis sigh was echoed in double chorus from the doorway. Glancing that way\r\nhe encountered the faces of his father and elder brother, and moved\r\ntowards them with a relieved air that made quite another man of him in\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n"I have had my say," he remarked. "Shall I wait outside till you have\r\nhad yours?"\r\n\r\n"We have already said all that we had to," Franklin returned. "We\r\ndeclared that we did not recognize this person."\r\n\r\n"Of course, of course," assented the other. "I don\'t see why they should\r\nhave expected us to know her. Some common suicide who thought the house\r\nempty--But how did she get in?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know?" said Mr. Gryce. "Can it be that I forgot to tell you?\r\nWhy, she was let in at night by a young man of medium height"--his eye\r\nran up and down the graceful figure of the young _\xe9l\xe9gant_ before him as\r\nhe spoke--"who left her inside and then went away. A young man who had a\r\nkey----"\r\n\r\n"A _key_? Franklin, I----"\r\n\r\nWas it a look from Franklin which made him stop? It is possible, for he\r\nturned on his heel as he reached this point, and tossing his head with\r\nquite a gay air, exclaimed: "But it is of no consequence! The girl is a\r\nstranger, and we have satisfied, I believe, all the requirements of the\r\nlaw in saying so, and may now drop the matter. Are you going to the\r\nclub, Franklin?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but----" Here the elder brother drew nearer and whispered\r\nsomething into the other\'s ear, who at that whisper turned again towards\r\nthe place where the dead woman lay. Seeing this movement, his anxious\r\nfather wiped the moisture from his forehead. Silas Van Burnam had been\r\nsilent up to this moment and seemed inclined to continue so, but he\r\nwatched his younger son with painful intentness.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" broke from Howard\'s lips as his brother ceased his\r\ncommunication; but he took a step nearer the body, notwithstanding, and\r\nthen another and another till he was at its side again.\r\n\r\nThe hands had not been injured, as we have said, and upon these his eyes\r\nnow fell.\r\n\r\n"They are like hers! O God! they are like hers!" he muttered, growing\r\ngloomy at once. "But where are the rings? There are no rings to be seen\r\non these fingers, and she wore five, including her wedding-ring."\r\n\r\n"Is it of your wife you are speaking?" inquired Mr. Gryce, who had edged\r\nup close to his side.\r\n\r\nThe young man was caught unawares.\r\n\r\nHe flushed deeply, but answered up boldly and with great appearance of\r\ncandor:\r\n\r\n"Yes; my wife left Haddam yesterday to come to New York, and I have not\r\nseen her since. Naturally I have felt some doubts lest this unhappy\r\nvictim should be she. But I do not recognize her clothing; I do not\r\nrecognize her form; only the hands look familiar."\r\n\r\n"And the hair?"\r\n\r\n"Is of the same color as hers, but it\'s a very ordinary color. I do not\r\ndare to say from anything I see that this is my wife."\r\n\r\n"We will call you again after the doctor has finished his autopsy," said\r\nMr. Gryce. "Perhaps you will hear from Mrs. Van Burnam before then."\r\n\r\nBut this intimation did not seem to bring comfort with it. Mr. Van\r\nBurnam walked away, white and sick, for which display of emotion there\r\nwas certainly some cause, and rejoining his father tried to carry off\r\nthe moment with the _aplomb_ of a man of the world.\r\n\r\nBut that father\'s eye was fixed too steadily upon him; he faltered as he\r\nsat down, and finally spoke up, with feverish energy:\r\n\r\n"If it is she, so help me, God, her death is a mystery to me! We have\r\nquarrelled more than once lately, and I have sometimes lost my patience\r\nwith her, but she had no reason to wish for death, and I am ready to\r\nswear in defiance of those hands, which are certainly like hers, and the\r\nnameless something which Franklin calls a likeness, that it is a\r\nstranger who lies there, and that her death in our house is a\r\ncoincidence."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, we will wait," was the detective\'s soothing reply. "Sit\r\ndown in the room opposite there, and give me your orders for supper, and\r\nI will see that a good meal is served you."\r\n\r\nThe three gentlemen, seeing no way of refusing, followed the discreet\r\nofficial who preceded them, and the door of the doctor\'s room closed\r\nupon him and the inquiries he was about to make.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nNEW FACTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Van Burnam and his sons had gone through the formality of a supper\r\nand were conversing in the haphazard way natural to men filled with a\r\nsubject they dare not discuss, when the door opened and Mr. Gryce came\r\nin.\r\n\r\nAdvancing very calmly, he addressed himself to the father:\r\n\r\n"I am sorry," said he, "to be obliged to inform you that this affair is\r\nmuch more serious than we anticipated. This young woman was dead before\r\nthe shelves laden with _bric-\xe0-brac_ fell upon her. It is a case of\r\nmurder; obviously so, or I should not presume to forestall the Coroner\'s\r\njury in their verdict."\r\n\r\nMurder! it is a word to shake the stoutest heart!\r\n\r\nThe older gentleman reeled as he half rose, and Franklin, his son,\r\nbetrayed in his own way an almost equal amount of emotion. But Howard,\r\nshrugging his shoulders as if relieved of an immense weight, looked\r\nabout with a cheerful air, and briskly cried:\r\n\r\n"Then it is not the body of my wife you have there. No one would murder\r\nLouise. I shall go away and prove the truth of my words by hunting her\r\nup at once."\r\n\r\nThe detective opened the door, beckoned in the doctor, who whispered\r\ntwo or three words into Howard\'s ear.\r\n\r\nThey failed to awake the emotion he evidently expected. Howard looked\r\nsurprised, but answered without any change of voice:\r\n\r\n"Yes, Louise had such a scar; and if it is true that this woman is\r\nsimilarly marked, then it is a mere coincidence. Nothing will convince\r\nme that my wife has been the victim of murder."\r\n\r\n"Had you not better take a look at the scar just mentioned?"\r\n\r\n"No. I am so sure of what I say that I will not even consider the\r\npossibility of my being mistaken. I have examined the clothing on this\r\nbody you have shown me, and not one article of it came from my wife\'s\r\nwardrobe; nor would my wife go, as you have informed me this woman did,\r\ninto a dark house at night with any other man than her husband."\r\n\r\n"And so you absolutely refuse to acknowledge her."\r\n\r\n"Most certainly."\r\n\r\nThe detective paused, glanced at the troubled faces of the other two\r\ngentlemen, faces that had not perceptibly altered during these\r\ndeclarations, and suggestively remarked:\r\n\r\n"You have not asked by what means she was killed."\r\n\r\n"And I don\'t care," shouted Howard.\r\n\r\n"It was by very peculiar means, also new in my experience."\r\n\r\n"It does not interest me," the other retorted.\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce turned to his father and brother.\r\n\r\n"Does it interest _you_?" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman, ordinarily so testy and so peremptory, silently\r\nnodded his head, while Franklin cried:\r\n\r\n"Speak up quick. You detectives hesitate so over the disagreeables. Was\r\nshe throttled or stabbed with a knife?"\r\n\r\n"I have said the means were peculiar. She was stabbed, but not--with a\r\nknife."\r\n\r\nI know Mr. Gryce well enough now to be sure that he did not glance\r\ntowards Howard while saying this, and yet at the same time that he did\r\nnot miss the quiver of a muscle on his part or the motion of an eyelash.\r\nBut Howard\'s assumed _sang froid_ remained undisturbed and his\r\ncountenance imperturbable.\r\n\r\n"The wound was so small," the detective went on, "that it is a miracle\r\nit did not escape notice. It was made by the thrust of some very slender\r\ninstrument through----"\r\n\r\n"The heart?" put in Franklin.\r\n\r\n"Of course, of course," assented the detective; "what other spot is\r\nvulnerable enough to cause death?"\r\n\r\n"Is there any reason why we should not go?" demanded Howard, ignoring\r\nthe extreme interest manifested by the other two, with a determination\r\nthat showed great doggedness of character.\r\n\r\nThe detective ignored _him_.\r\n\r\n"A quick stroke, a sure stroke, a fatal stroke. The girl never breathed\r\nafter."\r\n\r\n"But what of those things under which she lay crushed?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, in them lies the mystery! Her assailant must have been as subtle as\r\nhe was sure."\r\n\r\nAnd still Howard showed no interest.\r\n\r\n"I wish to telegraph to Haddam," he declared, as no one answered the\r\nlast remark. Haddam was the place where he and his wife had been\r\nspending the summer.\r\n\r\n"We have already telegraphed there," observed Mr. Gryce. "Your wife has\r\nnot yet returned."\r\n\r\n"There are other places," defiantly insisted the other. "I can find her\r\nif you give me the opportunity."\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce bowed.\r\n\r\n"I am to give orders, then, for this body to be removed to the Morgue."\r\n\r\nIt was an unexpected suggestion, and for an instant Howard showed that\r\nhe had feelings with the best. But he quickly recovered himself, and\r\navoiding the anxious glances of his father and brother, answered with\r\noffensive lightness:\r\n\r\n"I have nothing to do with that. You must do as you think proper."\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Gryce felt that he had received a check, and did not know\r\nwhether to admire the young man for his nerve or to execrate him for his\r\nbrutality. That the woman whom he had thus carelessly dismissed to the\r\nignominy of the public gaze was his wife, the detective did not doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nMR. GRYCE DISCOVERS MISS AMELIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo return to my own observations. I was almost as ignorant of what I\r\nwanted to know at ten o\'clock on that memorable night as I was at five,\r\nbut I was determined not to remain so. When the two Misses Van Burnam\r\nhad retired to their room, I slipped away to the neighboring house and\r\nboldly rang the bell. I had observed Mr. Gryce enter it a few minutes\r\nbefore, and I was resolved to have some talk with him.\r\n\r\nThe hall-lamp was lit, and we could discern each other\'s faces as he\r\nopened the door. Mine may have been a study, but I am sure his was. He\r\nhad not expected to be confronted by an elderly lady at that hour of\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n"Well!" he dryly ejaculated, "I am sensible of the honor, Miss\r\nButterworth." But he did not ask me in.\r\n\r\n"I expected no less," said I. "I saw you come in, and I followed as soon\r\nafter as I could. I have something to say to you."\r\n\r\nHe admitted me then and carefully closed the door. Feeling free to be\r\nmyself, I threw off the veil I had tied under my chin and confronted him\r\nwith what I call the true spirit.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Gryce," I began, "let us make an exchange of civilities. Tell me\r\nwhat you have done with Howard Van Burnam, and I will tell you what I\r\nhave observed in the course of this afternoon\'s investigation."\r\n\r\nThis aged detective is used to women, I have no doubt, but he is not\r\nused to _me_. I saw it by the way he turned over and over the spectacles\r\nhe held in his hand. I made an effort to help him out.\r\n\r\n"I have noted something to-day which I think has escaped _you_. It is so\r\nslight a clue that most women would not speak of it. But being\r\ninterested in the case, I will mention it, if in return you will\r\nacquaint me with what will appear in the papers to-morrow."\r\n\r\nHe seemed to like it. He peered through his glasses and at them with the\r\nsmile of a discoverer. "I am your very humble servant," he declared; and\r\nI felt as if my father\'s daughter had received her first recognition.\r\n\r\nBut he did not overwhelm me with confidences. O, no, he is very sly,\r\nthis old and well-seasoned detective; and while appearing to be very\r\ncommunicative, really parted with but little information. He said\r\nenough, however, for me to gather that matters looked grim for Howard,\r\nand if this was so, it must have become apparent that the death they\r\nwere investigating was neither an accident nor a suicide.\r\n\r\nI hinted as much, and he, for his own ends no doubt, admitted at last\r\nthat a wound had been found on the young woman which could not have been\r\ninflicted by herself; at which I felt such increased interest in this\r\nremarkable murder that I must have made some foolish display of it, for\r\nthe wary old gentleman chuckled and ogled his spectacles quite lovingly\r\nbefore shutting them up and putting them into his pocket.\r\n\r\n"And now what have you to tell me?" he inquired, sliding softly between\r\nme and the parlor door.\r\n\r\n"Nothing but this. Question that queer-acting house-cleaner closely. She\r\nhas something to tell which it is your business to know."\r\n\r\nI think he was disappointed. He looked as if he regretted the spectacles\r\nhe had pocketed, and when he spoke there was an edge to his tone I had\r\nnot noticed in it before.\r\n\r\n"Do you know what that something is?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"No, or I should tell you myself."\r\n\r\n"And what makes you think she is hiding anything from us?"\r\n\r\n"Her manner. Did you not notice her manner?"\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"It conveyed much to me," I insisted. "If I were a detective I would\r\nhave the secret out of that woman or die in the attempt."\r\n\r\nHe laughed; this sly, old, almost decrepit man laughed outright. Then he\r\nlooked severely at his old friend on the newel-post, and drawing himself\r\nup with some show of dignity, made this remark:\r\n\r\n"It is my very good fortune to have made your acquaintance, Miss\r\nButterworth. You and I ought to be able to work out this case in a way\r\nthat will be satisfactory to all parties."\r\n\r\nHe meant it for sarcasm, but I took it quite seriously, that is to all\r\nappearance. I am as sly as he, and though not quite as old--now _I_ am\r\nsarcastic--have some of his wits, if but little of his experience.\r\n\r\n"Then let us to work," said I. "You have your theories about this\r\nmurder, and I have mine; let us see how they compare."\r\n\r\nIf the image he had under his eye had not been made of bronze, I am sure\r\nit would have become petrified by the look he now gave it. What to me\r\nseemed but the natural proposition of an energetic woman with a special\r\ngenius for his particular calling, evidently struck him as audacity of\r\nthe grossest kind. But he confined his display of astonishment to the\r\nfigure he was eying, and returned me nothing but this most gentlemanly\r\nretort:\r\n\r\n"I am sure I am obliged to you, madam, and possibly I may be willing to\r\nconsider your very thoughtful proposition later, but now I am busy, very\r\nbusy, and if you will await my presence in your house for a half\r\nhour----"\r\n\r\n"Why not let me wait here," I interposed. "The atmosphere of the place\r\nmay sharpen my faculties. I already feel that another sharp look into\r\nthat parlor would lead to the forming of some valuable theory."\r\n\r\n"You--" Well, he did not say what I was, or rather, what the image he\r\nwas apostrophizing, was. But he must have meant to utter a compliment of\r\nno common order.\r\n\r\nThe prim courtesy I made in acknowledgment of his good intention\r\nsatisfied him that I had understood him fully; and changing his whole\r\nmanner to one more in accordance with business, he observed after a\r\nmoment\'s reflection:\r\n\r\n"You came to a conclusion this afternoon, Miss Butterworth, for which I\r\nshould like some explanation. In investigating the hat which had been\r\ndrawn from under the murdered girl\'s remains, you made the remark that\r\nit had been worn but once. I had already come to the same conclusion,\r\nbut by other means, doubtless. Will you tell me what it was that gave\r\npoint to your assertion?"\r\n\r\n"There was but one prick of a hat-pin in it," I observed. "If you have\r\nbeen in the habit of looking into young women\'s hats, you will\r\nappreciate the force of my remark."\r\n\r\n"The deuce!" was his certainly uncalled for exclamation. "Women\'s eyes\r\nfor women\'s matters! I am greatly indebted to you, ma\'am. You have\r\nsolved a very important problem for us. A hat-pin! humph!" he muttered\r\nto himself. "The devil in a man is not easily balked; even such an\r\ninnocent article as that can be made to serve, when all other means are\r\nlacking."\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps a proof that Mr. Gryce is getting old, that he allowed\r\nthese words to escape him. But having once given vent to them, he made\r\nno effort to retract them, but proceeded to take me into his confidence\r\nso far as to explain:\r\n\r\n"The woman who was killed in that room owed her death to the stab of a\r\nthin, long pin. We had not thought of a hat-pin, but upon your\r\nmentioning it, I am ready to accept it as the instrument of death. There\r\nwas no pin to be seen in the hat when you looked at it?"\r\n\r\n"None. I examined it most carefully."\r\n\r\nHe shook his head and seemed to be meditating. As I had plenty of time I\r\nwaited, expecting him to speak again. My patience seemed to impress him.\r\nAlternately raising and lowering his hands like one in the act of\r\nweighing something, he soon addressed me again, this time in a tone of\r\nbanter:\r\n\r\n"This pin--if pin it was--was found broken in the wound. We have been\r\nsearching for the end that was left in the murderer\'s hand, and we have\r\nnot found it. It is not on the floors of the parlors nor in this\r\nhallway. What do you think the ingenious user of such an instrument\r\nwould do with it?"\r\n\r\nThis was said, I am now sure, out of a spirit of sarcasm. He was amusing\r\nhimself with me, but I did not realize it then. I was too full of my\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n"He would not have carried it away," I reasoned shortly, "at least not\r\nfar. He did not throw it aside on reaching the street, for I watched his\r\nmovements so closely that I would have observed him had he done this. It\r\nis in the house then, and presumably in the parlor, even if you do not\r\nfind it on the floor."\r\n\r\n"Would you like to look for it?" he impressively asked. I had no means\r\nof knowing at that time that when he was impressive he was his least\r\ncandid and trustworthy self.\r\n\r\n"Would I," I repeated; and being spare in figure and much more active in\r\nmy movements that one would suppose from my age and dignified\r\ndeportment, I ducked under his arms and was in Mr. Van Burnam\'s parlor\r\nbefore he had recovered from his surprise.\r\n\r\nThat a man like him could look foolish I would not have you for a moment\r\nsuppose. But he did not look very well satisfied, and I had a chance to\r\nthrow more than one glance around me before he found his tongue again.\r\n\r\n"An unfair advantage, ma\'am; an unfair advantage! I am old and I am\r\nrheumatic; you are young and sound as a nut. I acknowledge my folly in\r\nendeavoring to compete with you and must make the best of the situation.\r\nAnd now, madam, where is that pin?"\r\n\r\nIt was lightly said, but for all that I saw that my opportunity had\r\ncome. If I could find this instrument of murder, what might I not expect\r\nfrom his gratitude. Nerving myself for the task thus set me, I peered\r\nhither and thither, taking in every article in the room before I made a\r\nstep forward. There had been some attempt to rectify its disorder. The\r\nbroken pieces of china had been lifted and laid carefully away on\r\nnewspapers upon the shelves from which they had fallen. The cabinet\r\nstood upright in its place, and the clock which had tumbled face upward,\r\nhad been placed upon the mantel shelf in the same position. The carpet\r\nwas therefore free, save for the stains which told such a woful story of\r\npast tragedy and crime.\r\n\r\n"You have moved the tables and searched behind the sofas," I suggested.\r\n\r\n"Not an inch of the floor has escaped our attention, madam."\r\n\r\nMy eyes fell on the register, which my skirts half covered. It was\r\nclosed; I stooped and opened it. A square box of tin was visible below,\r\nat the bottom of which I perceived the round head of a broken hat-pin.\r\n\r\nNever in my life had I felt as I did at that minute. Rising up, I\r\npointed at the register and let some of my triumph become apparent; but\r\nnot all, for I was by no means sure at that moment, nor am I by any\r\nmeans sure now, that he had not made the discovery before I did and was\r\nsimply testing my pretensions.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, he came forward quickly and after some little\r\neffort drew out the broken pin and examined it curiously.\r\n\r\n"I should say that this is what we want," he declared, and from that\r\nmoment on showed me a suitable deference.\r\n\r\n"I account for its being there in this way," I argued. "The room was\r\ndark; for whether he lighted it or not to commit his crime, he\r\ncertainly did not leave it lighted long. Coming out, his foot came in\r\ncontact with the iron of the register and he was struck by a sudden\r\nthought. He had not dared to leave the head of the pin lying on the\r\nfloor, for he hoped that he had covered up his crime by pulling the\r\nheavy cabinet over upon his victim; nor did he wish to carry away such a\r\nmemento of his cruel deed. So he dropped it down the register, where he\r\ndoubtless expected it would fall into the furnace pipes out of sight.\r\nBut the tin box retained it. Is not that plausible, sir?"\r\n\r\n"I could not have reasoned better myself, madam. We shall have you on\r\nthe force, yet."\r\n\r\nBut at the familiarity shown by this suggestion, I bridled angrily. "I\r\nam Miss Butterworth," was my sharp retort, "and any interest I may take\r\nin this matter is due to my sense of justice."\r\n\r\nSeeing that he had offended me, the astute detective turned the\r\nconversation back to business.\r\n\r\n"By the way," said he, "your woman\'s knowledge can help me out at\r\nanother point. If you are not afraid to remain in this room alone for a\r\nmoment, I will bring an article in regard to which I should like your\r\nopinion."\r\n\r\nI assured him I was not in the least bit afraid, at which he made me\r\nanother of his anomalous bows and passed into the adjoining parlor. He\r\ndid not stop there. Opening the sliding-doors communicating with the\r\ndining-room beyond, he disappeared in the latter room, shutting the\r\ndoors behind him. Being now alone for a moment on the scene of crime, I\r\ncrossed over to the mantel-shelf, and lifted the clock that lay there.\r\n\r\nWhy I did this I scarcely know. I am naturally very orderly (some people\r\ncall me precise) and it probably fretted me to see so valuable an\r\nobject out of its natural position. However that was, I lifted it up and\r\nset it upright, when to my amazement it began to tick. Had the hands not\r\nstood as they did when my eyes first fell on the clock lying face up on\r\nthe floor at the dead girl\'s side, I should have thought the works had\r\nbeen started since that time by Mr. Gryce or some other officious\r\nperson. But they pointed now as then to a few minutes before five and\r\nthe only conclusion I could arrive at was, that the clock had been in\r\nrunning order when it fell, startling as this fact appeared in a house\r\nwhich had not been inhabited for months.\r\n\r\nBut if it had been in running order and was only stopped by its fall\r\nupon the floor, why did the hands point at five instead of twelve which\r\nwas the hour at which the accident was supposed to have happened? Here\r\nwas matter for thought, and that I might be undisturbed in my use of it,\r\nI hastened to lay the clock down again, even taking the precaution to\r\nrestore the hands to the exact position they had occupied before I had\r\nstarted up the works. If Mr. Gryce did not know their secret, why so\r\nmuch the worse for Mr. Gryce.\r\n\r\nI was back in my old place by the register before the folding-doors\r\nunclosed again. I was conscious of a slight flush on my cheek, so I took\r\nfrom my pocket that perplexing grocer-bill and was laboriously going\r\ndown its long line of figures, when Mr. Gryce reappeared.\r\n\r\nHe had to my surprise a woman\'s hat in his hand.\r\n\r\n"Well!" thought I, "what does this mean!"\r\n\r\nIt was an elegant specimen of millinery, and was in the latest style. It\r\nhad ribbons and flowers and bird wings upon it, and presented, as it was\r\nturned about by Mr. Gryce\'s deft hand, an appearance which some might\r\nhave called charming, but to me was simply grotesque and absurd.\r\n\r\n"Is that a last spring\'s hat?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, but I should say it had come fresh from the milliner\'s."\r\n\r\n"I found it lying with a pair of gloves tucked inside it on an otherwise\r\nempty shelf in the dining-room closet. It struck me as looking too new\r\nfor a discarded hat of either of the Misses Van Burnam. What do you\r\nthink?"\r\n\r\n"Let me take it," said I.\r\n\r\n"O, it\'s been worn," he smiled, "several times. And the hat-pin is in\r\nit, too."\r\n\r\n"There is something else I wish to see."\r\n\r\nHe handed it over.\r\n\r\n"I think it belongs to one of them," I declared. "It was made by La Mole\r\nof Fifth Avenue, whose prices are simply--wicked."\r\n\r\n"But the young ladies have been gone--let me see--five months. Could\r\nthis have been bought before then?"\r\n\r\n"Possibly, for this is an imported hat. But why should it have been left\r\nlying about in that careless way? It cost twenty dollars, if not thirty,\r\nand if for any reason its owner decided not to take it with her, why\r\ndidn\'t she pack it away properly? I have no patience with the modern\r\ngirl; she is made up of recklessness and extravagance."\r\n\r\n"I hear that the young ladies are staying with you," was his suggestive\r\nremark.\r\n\r\n"They are."\r\n\r\n"Then you can make some inquiries about this hat; also about the gloves,\r\nwhich are an ordinary street pair."\r\n\r\n"Of what color?"\r\n\r\n"Grey; they are quite fresh, size six."\r\n\r\n"Very well; I will ask the young ladies about them."\r\n\r\n"This third room is used as a dining-room, and the closet where I found\r\nthem is one in which glass is kept. The presence of this hat there is a\r\nmystery, but I presume the Misses Van Burnam can solve it. At all\r\nevents, it is very improbable that it has anything to do with the crime\r\nwhich has been committed here."\r\n\r\n"Very," I coincided.\r\n\r\n"So improbable," he went on, "that on second thoughts I advise you not\r\nto disturb the young ladies with questions concerning it unless further\r\nreasons for doing so become apparent."\r\n\r\n"Very well," I returned. But I was not deceived by his second thoughts.\r\n\r\nAs he was holding open the parlor door before me in a very significant\r\nway, I tied my veil under my chin, and was about to leave when he\r\nstopped me.\r\n\r\n"I have another favor to ask," said he, and this time with his most\r\nbenignant smile. "Miss Butterworth, do you object to sitting up for a\r\nfew nights till twelve o\'clock?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all," I returned, "if there is any good reason for it."\r\n\r\n"At twelve o\'clock to-night a gentleman will enter this house. If you\r\nwill note him from your window I will be obliged."\r\n\r\n"To see whether he is the same one I saw last night? Certainly I will\r\ntake a look, but----"\r\n\r\n"To-morrow night," he went on, imperturbably, "the test will be\r\nrepeated, and I should like to have you take another look; without\r\nprejudice, madam; remember, without prejudice."\r\n\r\n"I have no prejudices----" I began.\r\n\r\n"The test may not be concluded in two nights," he proceeded, without any\r\nnotice of my words. "So do not be in haste to spot your man, as the\r\nvulgar expression is. And now good-night--we shall meet again\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Wait!" I called peremptorily, for he was on the point of closing the\r\ndoor. "I saw the man but faintly; it is an impression only that I\r\nreceived. I would not wish a man to hang through any identification I\r\ncould make."\r\n\r\n"No man hangs on simple identification. We shall have to prove the\r\ncrime, madam, but identification is important; even such as you can\r\nmake."\r\n\r\nThere was no more to be said; I uttered a calm good-night and hastened\r\naway. By a judicious use of my opportunities I had become much less\r\nignorant on the all-important topic than when I entered the house.\r\n\r\nIt was half past eleven when I returned home, a late hour for me to\r\nenter my respectable front door alone. But circumstances had warranted\r\nmy escapade, and it was with quite an easy conscience and a cheerful\r\nsense of accomplishment that I went up to my room and prepared to sit\r\nout the half hour before midnight.\r\n\r\nI am a comfortable sort of person when alone, and found no difficulty in\r\npassing this time profitably. Being very orderly, as you must have\r\nremarked, I have everything at hand for making myself a cup of tea at\r\nany time of day or night; so feeling some need of refreshment, I set out\r\nthe little table I reserve for such purposes and made the tea and sat\r\ndown to sip it.\r\n\r\nWhile doing so, I turned over the subject occupying my mind, and\r\nendeavored to reconcile the story told by the clock with my\r\npreconceived theory of this murder; but no reconcilement was possible.\r\nThe woman had been killed at twelve, and the clock had fallen at five.\r\nHow could the two be made to agree, and which, since agreement was\r\nimpossible, should be made to give way, the theory or the testimony of\r\nthe clock? Both seemed incontrovertible, and yet one must be false.\r\nWhich?\r\n\r\nI was inclined to think that the trouble lay with the clock; that I had\r\nbeen deceived in my conclusions, and that it was not running at the time\r\nof the crime. Mr. Gryce may have ordered it wound, and then have had it\r\nlaid on its back to prevent the hands from shifting past the point where\r\nthey had stood at the time of the crime\'s discovery. It was an\r\nunexplainable act, but a possible one; while to suppose that it was\r\ngoing when the shelves fell, stretched improbability to the utmost,\r\nthere having been, so far as we could learn, no one in the house for\r\nmonths sufficiently dexterous to set so valuable a timepiece; for who\r\ncould imagine the scrub-woman engaging in a task requiring such delicate\r\nmanipulation.\r\n\r\nNo! some meddlesome official had amused himself by starting up the\r\nworks, and the clue I had thought so important would probably prove\r\nvalueless.\r\n\r\nThere was humiliation in the thought, and it was a relief to me to hear\r\nan approaching carriage just as the clock on my mantel struck twelve.\r\nSpringing from my chair, I put out my light and flew to the window.\r\n\r\nThe coach drew up and stopped next door. I saw a gentleman descend and\r\nstep briskly across the pavement to the neighboring stoop. The figure he\r\npresented was not that of the man I had seen enter the night before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE MISSES VAN BURNAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nLate as it was when I retired, I was up betimes in the morning--as soon,\r\nin fact, as the papers were distributed. The _Tribune_ lay on the stoop.\r\nEagerly I seized it; eagerly I read it. From its headlines you may judge\r\nwhat it had to say about this murder:\r\n\r\n     A STARTLING DISCOVERY IN THE VAN BURNAM MANSION IN GRAMERCY\r\n     PARK.\r\n\r\n     A YOUNG GIRL FOUND THERE, LYING DEAD UNDER AN OVERTURNED\r\n     CABINET.\r\n\r\n     EVIDENCES THAT SHE WAS MURDERED BEFORE IT WAS PULLED DOWN UPON\r\n     HER.\r\n\r\n     THOUGHT BY SOME TO BE MRS. HOWARD VAN BURNAM.\r\n\r\n     A FEARFUL CRIME INVOLVED IN AN IMPENETRABLE MYSTERY.\r\n\r\n     WHAT MR. VAN BURNAM SAYS ABOUT IT: HE DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE\r\n     WOMAN AS HIS WIFE.\r\n\r\nSo, so, it was his wife they were talking about. I had not expected\r\nthat. Well! well! no wonder the girls looked startled and concerned. And\r\nI paused to recall what I had heard about Howard Van Burnam\'s marriage.\r\n\r\nIt had not been a fortunate one. His chosen bride was pretty enough, but\r\nshe had not been bred in the ways of fashionable society, and the other\r\nmembers of the family had never recognized her. The father, especially,\r\nhad cut his son dead since his marriage, and had even gone so far as to\r\nthreaten to dissolve the partnership in which they were all involved.\r\nWorse than this, there had been rumors of a disagreement between Howard\r\nand his wife. They were not always on good terms, and opinions differed\r\nas to which was most in fault. So much for what I knew of these two\r\nmentioned parties.\r\n\r\nReading the article at length, I learned that Mrs. Van Burnam was\r\nmissing; that she had left Haddam for New York the day before her\r\nhusband, and had not since been heard from. Howard was confident,\r\nhowever, that the publicity given to her disappearance by the papers\r\nwould bring immediate news of her.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the whole article was to raise grave doubts as to the\r\ncandor of Mr. Van Burnam\'s assertions, and I am told that in some of the\r\nless scrupulous papers these doubts were not only expressed, but actual\r\nsurmises ventured upon as to the identity between the person whom I had\r\nseen enter the house with the young girl. As for my own name, it was\r\nblazoned forth in anything but a gratifying manner. I was spoken of in\r\none paper--a kind friend told me this--as the prying Miss Amelia. As if\r\nmy prying had not given the police their only clue to the identification\r\nof the criminal.\r\n\r\nThe New York _World_ was the only paper that treated me with any\r\nconsideration. That young man with the small head and beady eyes was not\r\nawed by me for nothing. He mentioned me as the clever Miss Butterworth\r\nwhose testimony is likely to be of so much value in this very\r\ninteresting case.\r\n\r\nIt was the _World_ I handed the Misses Van Burnam when they came\r\ndown-stairs to breakfast. It did justice to me and not too much\r\ninjustice to him. They read it together, their two heads plunged deeply\r\ninto the paper so that I could not watch their faces. But I could see\r\nthe sheet shake, and I noticed that their social veneer was not as yet\r\nlaid on so thickly that they could hide their real terror and heart-ache\r\nwhen they finally confronted me again.\r\n\r\n"Did you read--have you seen this horrible account?" quavered Caroline,\r\nas she met my eye.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and I now understand why you felt such anxiety yesterday. Did you\r\nknow your sister-in-law, and do you think she could have been beguiled\r\ninto your father\'s house in that way?"\r\n\r\nIt was Isabella who answered.\r\n\r\n"We never have seen her and know little of her, but there is no telling\r\nwhat such an uncultivated person as she might do. But that our good\r\nbrother Howard ever went in there with her is a lie, isn\'t it,\r\nCaroline?--a base and malicious lie?"\r\n\r\n"Of course it is, of course, of course. You don\'t think the man you saw\r\nwas Howard, do you, dear Miss Butterworth?"\r\n\r\n_Dear?_ O dear!\r\n\r\n"I am not acquainted with your brother," I returned. "I have never seen\r\nhim but a few times in my life. You know he has not been a very frequent\r\nvisitor at your father\'s house lately."\r\n\r\nThey looked at me wistfully, _so_ wistfully.\r\n\r\n"Say it was not Howard," whispered Caroline, stealing up a little nearer\r\nto my side.\r\n\r\n"And we will never forget it," murmured Isabella, in what I am obliged\r\nto say was not her society manner.\r\n\r\n"I hope to be able to say it," was my short rejoinder, made difficult by\r\nthe prejudices I had formed. "When I see your brother, I may be able to\r\ndecide at a glance that the person I saw entering your house was not\r\nhe."\r\n\r\n"Yes, oh, yes. Do you hear that, Isabella? Miss Butterworth will save\r\nHoward yet. O you dear old soul. I could almost love you!"\r\n\r\nThis was not agreeable to me. I a dear old soul! A term to be applied to\r\na butter-woman not to a Butterworth. I drew back and their\r\nsentimentalities came to an end. I hope their brother Howard is not the\r\nguilty man the papers make him out to be, but if he is, the Misses Van\r\nBurnam\'s fine phrase, _We could almost love you_, will not deter me from\r\nbeing honest in the matter.\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce called early, and I was glad to be able to tell him that the\r\ngentleman who visited him the night before did not recall the impression\r\nmade upon me by the other. He received the communication quietly, and\r\nfrom his manner I judged that it was more or less expected. But who can\r\nbe a correct judge of a detective\'s manner, especially one so foxy and\r\nimperturbable as this one? I longed to ask who his visitor was, but I\r\ndid not dare, or rather--to be candid in little things that you may\r\nbelieve me in great--I was confident he would not tell me, so I would\r\nnot compromise my dignity by a useless question.\r\n\r\nHe went after a five minutes\' stay, and I was about to turn my attention\r\nto household affairs, when Franklin came in.\r\n\r\nHis sisters jumped like puppets to meet him.\r\n\r\n"O," they cried, for once thinking and speaking alike, "have you found\r\nher?"\r\n\r\nHis silence was so eloquent that he did not need to shake his head.\r\n\r\n"But you will before the day is out?" protested Caroline.\r\n\r\n"It is too early yet," added Isabella.\r\n\r\n"I never thought I would be glad to see that woman under any\r\ncircumstances," continued the former, "but I believe now that if I saw\r\nher coming up the street on Howard\'s arm, I should be happy enough to\r\nrush out and--and----"\r\n\r\n"Give her a hug," finished the more impetuous Isabella.\r\n\r\nIt was not what Caroline meant to say, but she accepted the emendation,\r\nwith just the slightest air of deprecation. They were both evidently\r\nmuch attached to Howard, and ready in his trouble to forget and forgive\r\neverything. I began to like them again.\r\n\r\n"Have you read the horrid papers?" and "How is papa this morning?" and\r\n"What shall we do to save Howard?" now flew in rapid questions from\r\ntheir lips; and feeling that it was but natural they should have their\r\nlittle say, I sat down in my most uncomfortable chair and waited for\r\nthese first ebullitions to exhaust themselves.\r\n\r\nInstantly Mr. Van Burnam took them by the arm, and led them away to a\r\ndistant sofa.\r\n\r\n"Are you happy here?" he asked, in what he meant for a very confidential\r\ntone. But I can hear as readily as a deaf person anything which is not\r\nmeant for my ears.\r\n\r\n"O she\'s kind enough," whispered Caroline, "but so stingy. Do take us\r\nwhere we can get something to eat."\r\n\r\n"She puts all her money into china! Such plates!--_and so little on\r\nthem!_"\r\n\r\nAt these expressions, uttered with all the emphasis a whisper will\r\nallow, I just hugged myself in my quiet corner. The dear, giddy things!\r\nBut they should see, they should see.\r\n\r\n"I fear"--it was Mr. Van Burnam who now spoke--"I shall have to take my\r\nsisters from under your kind care to-day. Their father needs them, and\r\nhas, I believe, already engaged rooms for them at the Plaza."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry," I replied, "but surely they will not leave till they have\r\nhad another meal with me. Postpone your departure, young ladies, till\r\nafter luncheon, and you will greatly oblige me. We may never meet so\r\nagreeably again."\r\n\r\nThey fidgeted (which I had expected), and cast secret looks of almost\r\ncomic appeal at their brother, but he pretended not to see them, being\r\ndisposed for some reason to grant my request. Taking advantage of the\r\nmomentary hesitation that ensued, I made them all three my most\r\nconciliatory bow, and said as I retreated behind the porti\xe8re:\r\n\r\n"I shall give my orders for luncheon now. Meanwhile, I hope the young\r\nladies will feel perfectly free in my house. All that I have is at their\r\ncommand." And was gone before they could protest.\r\n\r\nWhen I next saw them, they were upstairs in my front room. They were\r\nseated together in the window and looked miserable enough to have a\r\nlittle diversion. Going to my closet, I brought out a band-box. It\r\ncontained my best bonnet.\r\n\r\n"Young ladies, what do you think of this?" I inquired, taking the bonnet\r\nout and carefully placing it on my head.\r\n\r\nI myself consider it a very becoming article of headgear, but their\r\neyebrows went up in a scarcely complimentary fashion.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t like it?" I remarked. "Well, I think a great deal of young\r\ngirls\' taste; I shall send it back to Madame More\'s to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think much of Madame More," observed Isabella, "and after\r\nParis----"\r\n\r\n"Do you like La Mole better?" I inquired, bobbing my head to and fro\r\nbefore the mirror, the better to conceal my interest in the venture I\r\nwas making.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like any of them but D\'Aubigny," returned Isabella. "She\r\ncharges twice what La Mole does----"\r\n\r\nTwice! What are these girls\' purses made of, or rather their father\'s!\r\n\r\n"But she has the _chic_ we are accustomed to see in French millinery. I\r\nshall _never_ go anywhere else."\r\n\r\n"We were recommended to her in Paris," put in Caroline, more languidly.\r\nHer interest was only half engaged by this frivolous topic.\r\n\r\n"But did you never have one of La Mole\'s hats?" I pursued, taking down\r\na hand-mirror, ostensibly to get the effect of my bonnet in the back,\r\nbut really to hide my interest in their unconscious faces.\r\n\r\n"Never!" retorted Isabella. "I would not patronize the thing."\r\n\r\n"Nor you?" I urged, carelessly, turning towards Caroline.\r\n\r\n"No; I have never been inside her shop."\r\n\r\n"Then whose is----" I began and stopped. A detective doing the work I\r\nwas, would not give away the object of his questions so recklessly.\r\n\r\n"Then who is," I corrected, "the best person after D\'Aubigny? I never\r\ncan pay _her_ prices. I should think it wicked."\r\n\r\n"O don\'t ask us," protested Isabella. "We have never made a study of the\r\nbest bonnet-maker. At present we wear hats."\r\n\r\nAnd having thus thrown their youth in my face, they turned away to the\r\nwindow again, not realizing that the middle-aged lady they regarded with\r\nsuch disdain had just succeeded in making them dance to her music most\r\nsuccessfully.\r\n\r\nThe luncheon I ordered was elaborate, for I was determined that the\r\nMisses Van Burnam should see that I knew how to serve a fine meal, and\r\nthat my plates were not always better than my viands.\r\n\r\nI had invited in a couple of other guests so that I should not seem to\r\nhave put myself out for two young girls, and as they were quiet people\r\nlike myself, the meal passed most decorously. When it was finished, the\r\nMisses Caroline and Isabella had lost some of their consequential airs,\r\nand I really think the deference they have since showed me is due more\r\nto the surprise they felt at the perfection of this dainty luncheon,\r\nthan to any considerate appreciation of my character and abilities.\r\n\r\nThey left at three o\'clock, still without news of Mrs. Van Burnam; and\r\nbeing positive by this time that the shadows were thickening about this\r\nfamily, I saw them depart with some regret and a positive feeling of\r\ncommiseration. Had they been reared to a proper reverence for their\r\nelders, how much more easy it would have been to see earnestness in\r\nCaroline and affectionate impulses in Isabella.\r\n\r\nThe evening papers added but little to my knowledge. Great disclosures\r\nwere promised, but no hint given of their nature. The body at the Morgue\r\nhad not been identified by any of the hundreds who had viewed it, and\r\nHoward still refused to acknowledge it as that of his wife. The morrow\r\nwas awaited with anxiety.\r\n\r\nSo much for the public press!\r\n\r\nAt twelve o\'clock at night, I was again seated in my window. The house\r\nnext door had been lighted since ten, and I was in momentary expectation\r\nof its nocturnal visitor. He came promptly at the hour set, alighted\r\nfrom the carriage with a bound, shut the carriage-door with a slam, and\r\ncrossed the pavement with cheerful celerity. His figure was not so\r\npositively like, nor yet so positively unlike, that of the supposed\r\nmurderer that I could definitely say, "This is he," or, "This is not\r\nhe," and I went to bed puzzled, and not a little burdened by a sense of\r\nthe responsibility imposed upon me in this matter.\r\n\r\nAnd so passed the day between the murder and the inquest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce called about nine o\'clock next morning.\r\n\r\n"Well," said he, "what about the visitor who came to see me last night?"\r\n\r\n"Like and unlike," I answered. "Nothing could induce me to say he is the\r\nman we want, and yet I would not dare to swear he was not."\r\n\r\n"You are in doubt, then, concerning him?"\r\n\r\n"I am."\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce bowed, reminded me of the inquest, and left. Nothing was said\r\nabout the hat.\r\n\r\nAt ten o\'clock I prepared to go to the place designated by him. I had\r\nnever attended an inquest in my life, and felt a little flurried in\r\nconsequence, but by the time I had tied the strings of my bonnet (the\r\ndespised bonnet, which, by the way, I did not return to More\'s), I had\r\nconquered this weakness, and acquired a demeanor more in keeping with my\r\nvery important position as chief witness in a serious police\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nI had sent for a carriage to take me, and I rode away from my house amid\r\nthe shouts of some half dozen boys collected on the curb-stone. But I\r\ndid not allow myself to feel dashed by this publicity. On the contrary,\r\nI held my head as erect as nature intended, and my back kept the line\r\nmy good health warrants. The path of duty has its thorny passages, but\r\nit is for strong minds like mine to ignore them.\r\n\r\nPromptly at ten o\'clock I entered the room reserved for the inquest, and\r\nwas ushered to the seat appointed me. Though never a self-conscious\r\nwoman, I could not but be aware of the many eyes that followed me, and\r\nendeavored so to demean myself that there should be no question as to my\r\nrespectable standing in the community. This I considered due to the\r\nmemory of my father, who was very much in my thoughts that day.\r\n\r\nThe Coroner was already in his seat when I entered, and though I did not\r\nperceive the good face of Mr. Gryce anywhere in his vicinity, I had no\r\ndoubt he was within ear-shot. Of the other people I took small note,\r\nsave of the honest scrub-woman, of whose red face and anxious eyes under\r\na preposterous bonnet (which did _not come_ from La Mole\'s), I caught\r\nvague glimpses as the crowd between us surged to and fro.\r\n\r\nNone of the Van Burnams were visible, but this did not necessarily mean\r\nthat they were absent. Indeed, I was very sure, from certain\r\nindications, that more than one member of the family could be seen in\r\nthe small room connecting with the large one in which we witnesses sat\r\nwith the jury.\r\n\r\nThe policeman, Carroll, was the first man to talk. He told of my\r\nstopping him on his beat and of his entrance into Mr. Van Burnam\'s house\r\nwith the scrub-woman. He gave the details of his discovery of the dead\r\nwoman\'s body on the parlor floor, and insisted that no one--here he\r\nlooked very hard at me--had been allowed to touch the body till relief\r\nhad come to him from Headquarters.\r\n\r\nMrs. Boppert, the scrub-woman, followed him; and if she was watched by\r\nno one else in that room, she was watched by me. Her manner before the\r\nCoroner was no more satisfactory, according to my notion, than it had\r\nbeen in Mr. Van Burnam\'s parlor. She gave a very perceptible start when\r\nthey spoke her name, and looked quite scared when the Bible was held out\r\ntowards her. But she took the oath notwithstanding, and with her\r\ntestimony the inquiry began in earnest.\r\n\r\n"What is your name?" asked the Coroner.\r\n\r\nAs this was something she could not help knowing, she uttered the\r\nnecessary words glibly, though in a way that showed she resented his\r\nimpertinence in asking her what he already knew.\r\n\r\n"Where do you live? And what do you do for a living?" rapidly followed.\r\n\r\nShe replied that she was a scrub-woman and cleaned people\'s houses, and\r\nhaving said this, she assumed a very dogged air, which I thought strange\r\nenough to raise a question in the minds of those who watched her. But no\r\none else seemed to regard it as anything but the embarrassment of\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\n"How long have you known the Van Burnam family?" the Coroner went on.\r\n\r\n"Two years, sir, come next Christmas."\r\n\r\n"Have you often done work for them?"\r\n\r\n"I clean the house twice a year, fall and spring."\r\n\r\n"Why were you at this house two days ago?"\r\n\r\n"To scrub the kitchen floors, sir, and put the pantries in order."\r\n\r\n"Had you received notice to do so?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, through Mr. Franklin Van Burnam."\r\n\r\n"And was that the first day of your work there?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir; I had been there all the day before."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t speak loud enough," objected the Coroner; "remember that\r\nevery one in this room wants to hear you."\r\n\r\nShe looked up, and with a frightened air surveyed the crowd about her.\r\nPublicity evidently made her most uncomfortable, and her voice sank\r\nrather than rose.\r\n\r\n"Where did you get the key of the house, and by what door did you\r\nenter?"\r\n\r\n"I went in at the basement, sir, and I got the key at Mr. Van Burnam\'s\r\nagent in Dey Street. I had to go for it; sometimes they send it to me;\r\nbut not this time."\r\n\r\n"And now relate your meeting with the policeman on Wednesday morning, in\r\nfront of Mr. Van Burnam\'s house."\r\n\r\nShe tried to tell her story, but she made awkward work of it, and they\r\nhad to ply her with questions to get at the smallest fact. But finally\r\nshe managed to repeat what we already knew, how she went with the\r\npoliceman into the house, and how they stumbled upon the dead woman in\r\nthe parlor.\r\n\r\nFurther than this they did not question her, and I, Amelia Butterworth,\r\nhad to sit in silence and see her go back to her seat, redder than\r\nbefore, but with a strangely satisfied air that told me she had escaped\r\nmore easily than she had expected. And yet Mr. Gryce had been warned\r\nthat she knew more than appeared, and by one in whom he seemed to have\r\nplaced some confidence!\r\n\r\nThe doctor was called next. His testimony was most important, and\r\ncontained a surprise for me and more than one surprise for the others.\r\nAfter a short preliminary examination, he was requested to state how\r\nlong the woman had been dead when he was called in to examine her.\r\n\r\n"More than twelve and less than eighteen hours," was his quiet reply.\r\n\r\n"Had the rigor mortis set in?"\r\n\r\n"No; but it began very soon after."\r\n\r\n"Did you examine the wounds made by the falling shelves and the vases\r\nthat tumbled with them?"\r\n\r\n"I did."\r\n\r\n"Will you describe them?"\r\n\r\nHe did so.\r\n\r\n"And now"--there was a pause in the Coroner\'s question which roused us\r\nall to its importance, "which of these many serious wounds was in your\r\nopinion the cause of her death?"\r\n\r\nThe witness was accustomed to such scenes, and was perfectly at home in\r\nthem. Surveying the Coroner with a respectful air, he turned slowly\r\ntowards the jury and answered in a slow and impressive manner:\r\n\r\n"I feel ready to declare, sirs, that none of them did. She was not\r\nkilled by the falling of the cabinet upon her."\r\n\r\n"Not killed by the falling shelves! Why not? Were they not sufficiently\r\nheavy, or did they not strike her in a vital place?"\r\n\r\n"They were heavy enough, and they struck her in a way to kill her if she\r\nhad not been already dead when they fell upon her. As it was, they\r\nsimply bruised a body from which life had already departed."\r\n\r\nAs this was putting it very plainly, many of the crowd who had not been\r\nacquainted with these facts previously, showed their interest in a very\r\nunmistakable manner; but the Coroner, ignoring these symptoms of growing\r\nexcitement, hastened to say:\r\n\r\n"This is a very serious statement you are making, doctor. If she did not\r\ndie from the wounds inflicted by the objects which fell upon her, from\r\nwhat cause did she die? Can you say that her death was a natural one,\r\nand that the falling of the shelves was merely an unhappy accident\r\nfollowing it?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir; her death was not natural. She was killed, but not by the\r\nfalling cabinet."\r\n\r\n"Killed, and not by the cabinet? How then? Was there any other wound\r\nupon her which you regard as mortal?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. Suspecting that she had perished from other means than\r\nappeared, I made a most rigid examination of her body, when I discovered\r\nunder the hair in the nape of the neck, a minute spot, which, upon\r\nprobing, I found to be the end of a small, thin point of steel. It had\r\nbeen thrust by a careful hand into the most vulnerable part of the body,\r\nand death must have ensued at once."\r\n\r\nThis was too much for certain excitable persons present, and a momentary\r\ndisturbance arose, which, however, was nothing to that in my own breast.\r\n\r\nSo! so! it was her neck that had been pierced, and not her heart. Mr.\r\nGryce had allowed us to think it was the latter, but it was not this\r\nfact which stupefied me, but the skill and diabolical coolness of the\r\nman who had inflicted this death-thrust.\r\n\r\nAfter order had been restored, which I will say was very soon, the\r\nCoroner, with an added gravity of tone, went on with his questions:\r\n\r\n"Did you recognize this bit of steel as belonging to any instrument in\r\nthe medical profession?"\r\n\r\n"No; it was of too untempered steel to have been manufactured for any\r\nthrusting or cutting purposes. It was of the commonest kind, and had\r\nbroken short off in the wound. It was the end only that I found."\r\n\r\n"Have you this end with you,--the point, I mean, which you found\r\nimbedded at the base of the dead woman\'s brain?"\r\n\r\n"I have, sir"; and he handed it over to the jury. As they passed it\r\nalong, the Coroner remarked:\r\n\r\n"Later we will show you the remaining portion of this instrument of\r\ndeath," which did not tend to allay the general excitement. Seeing this,\r\nthe Coroner humored the growing interest by pushing on his inquiries.\r\n\r\n"Doctor," he asked, "are you prepared to say how long a time elapsed\r\nbetween the infliction of this fatal wound and those which disfigured\r\nher?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir, not exactly; but some little time."\r\n\r\nSome little time, when the murderer was in the house only ten minutes!\r\nAll looked their surprise, and, as if the Coroner had divined this\r\nfeeling of general curiosity, he leaned forward and emphatically\r\nrepeated:\r\n\r\n"More than ten minutes?"\r\n\r\nThe doctor, who had every appearance of realizing the importance of his\r\nreply, did not hesitate. Evidently his mind was quite made up.\r\n\r\n"_Yes; more than ten minutes_."\r\n\r\nThis was the shock _I_ received from his testimony.\r\n\r\nI remembered what the clock had revealed to me, but I did not move a\r\nmuscle of my face. I was learning self-control under these repeated\r\nsurprises.\r\n\r\n"This is an unexpected statement," remarked the Coroner. "What reasons\r\nhave you to urge in explanation of it?"\r\n\r\n"Very simple and very well known ones; at least, among the profession.\r\nThere was too little blood seen, for the wounds to have been inflicted\r\nbefore death or within a few minutes after it. Had the woman been living\r\nwhen they were made, or even had she been but a short time dead, the\r\nfloor would have been deluged with the blood gushing from so many and\r\nsuch serious injuries. But the effusion was slight, so slight that I\r\nnoticed it at once, and came to the conclusions mentioned before I found\r\nthe mark of the stab that occasioned death."\r\n\r\n"I see, I see! And was that the reason you called in two neighboring\r\nphysicians to view the body before it was removed from the house?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; in so important a matter, I wished to have my judgment\r\nconfirmed."\r\n\r\n"And these physicians were----"\r\n\r\n"Dr. Campbell, of 110 East ---- Street, and Dr. Jacobs, of ----\r\nLexington Avenue."\r\n\r\n"Are these gentlemen here?" inquired the Coroner of an officer who stood\r\nnear.\r\n\r\n"They are, sir."\r\n\r\n"Very good; we will now proceed to ask one or two more questions of this\r\nwitness. You told us that even had the woman been but a few minutes dead\r\nwhen she received these contusions, the floor would have been more or\r\nless deluged by her blood. What reason have you for this statement?"\r\n\r\n"This; that in a few minutes, let us say ten, since that number has been\r\nused, the body has not had time to cool, nor have the blood-vessels had\r\nsufficient opportunity to stiffen so as to prevent the free effusion of\r\nblood."\r\n\r\n"Is a body still warm at ten minutes after death?"\r\n\r\n"It is."\r\n\r\n"So that your conclusions are logical deductions from well-known facts?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly, sir."\r\n\r\nA pause of some duration followed.\r\n\r\nWhen the Coroner again proceeded, it was to remark:\r\n\r\n"The case is complicated by these discoveries; but we must not allow\r\nourselves to be daunted by them. Let me ask you, if you found any marks\r\nupon this body which might aid in its identification?"\r\n\r\n"One; a slight scar on the left ankle."\r\n\r\n"What kind of a scar? Describe it."\r\n\r\n"It was such as a burn might leave. In shape it was long and narrow, and\r\nit ran up the limb from the ankle-bone."\r\n\r\n"Was it on the right foot?"\r\n\r\n"No; on the left."\r\n\r\n"Did you call the attention of any one to this mark during or after your\r\nexamination?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I showed it to Mr. Gryce the detective, and to my two coadjutors;\r\nand I spoke of it to Mr. Howard Van Burnam, son of the gentleman in\r\nwhose house the body was found."\r\n\r\nIt was the first time this young gentleman\'s name had been mentioned,\r\nand it made my blood run cold to see how many side-long looks and\r\nexpressive shrugs it caused in the motley assemblage. But I had no time\r\nfor sentiment; the inquiry was growing too interesting.\r\n\r\n"And why," asked the Coroner, "did you mention it to this young man in\r\npreference to others?"\r\n\r\n"Because Mr. Gryce requested me to. Because the family as well as the\r\nyoung man himself had evinced some apprehension lest the deceased might\r\nprove to be his missing wife, and this seemed a likely way to settle the\r\nquestion."\r\n\r\n"And did it? Did he acknowledge it to be a mark he remembered to have\r\nseen on his wife?"\r\n\r\n"He said she had such a scar, but he would not acknowledge the deceased\r\nto be his wife."\r\n\r\n"Did he see the scar?"\r\n\r\n"No; he would not look at it."\r\n\r\n"Did you invite him to?"\r\n\r\n"I did; but he showed no curiosity."\r\n\r\nDoubtless thinking that silence would best emphasize this fact, which\r\ncertainly was an astonishing one, the Coroner waited a minute. But there\r\nwas no silence. An indescribable murmur from a great many lips filled up\r\nthe gap. I felt a movement of pity for the proud family whose good name\r\nwas thus threatened in the person of this young gentleman.\r\n\r\n"Doctor," continued the Coroner, as soon as the murmur had subsided,\r\n"did you notice the color of the woman\'s hair?"\r\n\r\n"It was a light brown."\r\n\r\n"Did you sever a lock? Have you a sample of this hair here to show us?"\r\n\r\n"I have, sir. At Mr. Gryce\'s suggestion I cut off two small locks. One I\r\ngave him and the other I brought here."\r\n\r\n"Let me see it."\r\n\r\nThe doctor passed it up, and in sight of every one present the Coroner\r\ntied a string around it and attached a ticket to it.\r\n\r\n"That is to prevent all mistake," explained this very methodical\r\nfunctionary, laying the lock aside on the table in front of him. Then he\r\nturned again to the witness.\r\n\r\n"Doctor, we are indebted to you for your valuable testimony, and as you\r\nare a busy man, we will now excuse you. Let Dr. Jacobs be called."\r\n\r\nAs this gentleman, as well as the witness who followed him, merely\r\ncorroborated the statements of the other, and made it an accepted fact\r\nthat the shelves had fallen upon the body of the girl some time after\r\nthe first wound had been inflicted, I will not attempt to repeat their\r\ntestimony. The question now agitating me was whether they would endeavor\r\nto fix the time at which the shelves fell by the evidence furnished by\r\nthe clock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT EVIDENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvidently not; for the next words I heard were: "Miss Amelia\r\nButterworth!"\r\n\r\nI had not expected to be called so soon, and was somewhat flustered by\r\nthe suddenness of the summons, for I am only human. But I rose with\r\nsuitable composure, and passed to the place indicated by the Coroner, in\r\nmy usual straightforward manner, heightened only by a sense of the\r\nimportance of my position, both as a witness and a woman whom the once\r\nfamous Mr. Gryce had taken more or less into his confidence.\r\n\r\nMy appearance seemed to awaken an interest for which I was not prepared.\r\nI was just thinking how well my name had sounded uttered in the sonorous\r\ntones of the Coroner, and how grateful I ought to be for the courage I\r\nhad displayed in substituting the genteel name of Amelia for the weak\r\nand sentimental one of Araminta, when I became conscious that the eyes\r\ndirected towards me were filled with an expression not easy to\r\nunderstand. I should not like to call it admiration and will not call it\r\namusement, and yet it seemed to be made up of both. While I was puzzling\r\nmyself over it, the first question came.\r\n\r\nAs my examination before the Coroner only brought out the facts already\r\nrelated, I will not burden you with a detailed account of it. One\r\nportion alone may be of interest. I was being questioned in regard to\r\nthe appearance of the couple I had seen entering the Van Burnam mansion,\r\nwhen the Coroner asked if the young woman\'s step was light, or if it\r\nbetrayed hesitation.\r\n\r\nI replied: "No hesitation; she moved quickly, almost gaily."\r\n\r\n"And he?"\r\n\r\n"Was more moderate; but there is no signification in that; he may have\r\nbeen older."\r\n\r\n"No theories, Miss Butterworth; it is facts we are after. Now, do you\r\nknow that he was older?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"Did you get any idea as to his age?"\r\n\r\n"The impression he made was that of being a young man."\r\n\r\n"And his height?"\r\n\r\n"Was medium, and his figure slight and elegant. He moved as a gentleman\r\nmoves; of this I can speak with great positiveness."\r\n\r\n"Do you think you could identify him, Miss Butterworth, if you should\r\nsee him?"\r\n\r\nI hesitated, as I perceived that the whole swaying mass eagerly awaited\r\nmy reply. I even turned my head because I saw others doing so; but I\r\nregretted this when I found that I, as well as others, was glancing\r\ntowards the door beyond which the Van Burnams were supposed to sit. To\r\ncover up the false move I had made--for I had no wish as yet to centre\r\nsuspicion upon anybody--I turned my face quickly back to the crowd and\r\ndeclared in as emphatic a tone as I could command:\r\n\r\n"I have thought I could do so if I saw him under the same circumstances\r\nas those in which my first impression was made. But lately I have begun\r\nto doubt even that. I should never dare trust to my memory in this\r\nregard."\r\n\r\nThe Coroner looked disappointed, and so did the people around me.\r\n\r\n"It is a pity," remarked the Coroner, "that you did not see more\r\nplainly. And, now, how did these persons gain an entrance into the\r\nhouse?"\r\n\r\nI answered in the most succinct way possible.\r\n\r\nI told them how he had used a door-key in entering, of the length of\r\ntime the man stayed inside, and of his appearance on going away. I also\r\nrelated how I came to call a policeman to investigate the matter next\r\nday, and corroborated the statements of this official as to the\r\nappearance of the deceased at time of discovery.\r\n\r\nAnd there my examination stopped. I was not asked any questions tending\r\nto bring out the cause of the suspicion I entertained against the\r\nscrub-woman, nor were the discoveries I had made in conjunction with Mr.\r\nGryce inquired into. It was just as well, perhaps, but I would never\r\napprove of a piece of work done for me in this slipshod fashion.\r\n\r\nA recess now followed. Why it was thought necessary, I cannot imagine,\r\nunless the gentlemen wished to smoke. Had they felt as much interest in\r\nthis murder as I did, they would not have wanted bite or sup till the\r\ndreadful question was settled. There being a recess, I improved the\r\nopportunity by going into a restaurant near by where one can get very\r\ngood buns and coffee at a reasonable price. But I could have done\r\nwithout them.\r\n\r\nThe next witness, to my astonishment, was Mr. Gryce. As he stepped\r\nforward, heads were craned and many women rose in their seats to get a\r\nglimpse of the noted detective. I showed no curiosity myself, for by\r\nthis time I knew his features well, but I did feel a great satisfaction\r\nin seeing him before the Coroner, for now, thought I, we shall hear\r\nsomething worth our attention.\r\n\r\nBut his examination, though interesting, was not complete. The Coroner,\r\nremembering his promise to show us the other end of the steel point\r\nwhich had been broken off in the dead girl\'s brain, limited himself to\r\nsuch inquiries as brought out the discovery of the broken hat-pin in Mr.\r\nVan Burnam\'s parlor register. No mention was made by the witness of any\r\nassistance which he may have received in making this discovery; a fact\r\nwhich caused me to smile: men are so jealous of any interference in\r\ntheir affairs.\r\n\r\nThe end found in the register and the end which the Coroner\'s physician\r\nhad drawn from the poor woman\'s head were both handed to the jury, and\r\nit was interesting to note how each man made his little effort to fit\r\nthe two ends together, and the looks they interchanged as they found\r\nthemselves successful. Without doubt, and in the eyes of all, the\r\ninstrument of death had been found. But what an instrument!\r\n\r\nThe felt hat which had been discovered under the body was now produced\r\nand the one hole made by a similar pin examined. Then Mr. Gryce was\r\nasked if any other pin had been picked up from the floor of the room,\r\nand he replied, no; and the fact was established in the minds of all\r\npresent that the young woman had been killed by a pin taken from her own\r\nhat.\r\n\r\n"A subtle and cruel crime; the work of a calculating intellect," was the\r\nCoroner\'s comment as he allowed the detective to sit down. Which\r\nexpression of opinion I thought reprehensible, as tending to prejudice\r\nthe jury against the only person at present suspected.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry now took a turn. The name of Miss Ferguson was called. Who\r\nwas Miss Ferguson? It was a new name to most of us, and her face when\r\nshe rose only added to the general curiosity. It was the plainest face\r\nimaginable, yet it was neither a bad nor unintelligent one. As I studied\r\nit and noted the nervous contraction that disfigured her lip, I could\r\nnot but be sensible of my blessings. I am not handsome myself, though\r\nthere have been persons who have called me so, but neither am I ugly,\r\nand in contrast to this woman--well, I will say nothing. I only know\r\nthat, after seeing her, I felt profoundly grateful to a kind Providence.\r\n\r\nAs for the poor woman herself, she knew she was no beauty, but she had\r\nbecome so accustomed to seeing the eyes of other people turn away from\r\nher face, that beyond the nervous twitching of which I have spoken, she\r\nshowed no feeling.\r\n\r\n"What is your full name, and where do you live?" asked the Coroner.\r\n\r\n"My name is Susan Ferguson, and I live in Haddam, Connecticut," was her\r\nreply, uttered in such soft and beautiful tones that every one was\r\nastonished. It was like a stream of limpid water flowing from a most\r\nunsightly-looking rock. Excuse the metaphor; I do not often indulge.\r\n\r\n"Do you keep boarders?"\r\n\r\n"I do; a few, sir; such as my house will accommodate."\r\n\r\n"Whom have you had with you this summer?"\r\n\r\nI knew what her answer would be before she uttered it; so did a hundred\r\nothers, but they showed their knowledge in different ways. I did not\r\nshow mine at all.\r\n\r\n"I have had with me," said she, "a Mr. and Mrs. Van Burnam from New\r\nYork. Mr. Howard Van Burnam is his full name, if you wish me to be\r\nexplicit."\r\n\r\n"Any one else?"\r\n\r\n"A Mr. Hull, also from New York, and a young couple from Hartford. My\r\nhouse accommodates no more."\r\n\r\n"How long have the first mentioned couple been with you?"\r\n\r\n"Three months. They came in June."\r\n\r\n"Are they with you still?"\r\n\r\n"Virtually, sir. They have not moved their trunks; but neither of them\r\nis in Haddam at present. Mrs. Van Burnam came to New York last Monday\r\nmorning, and in the afternoon her husband also left, presumably for New\r\nYork. I have seen nothing of either of them since."\r\n\r\n(It was on Tuesday night the murder occurred.)\r\n\r\n"Did either of them take a trunk?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"A hand-bag?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; Mrs. Van Burnam carried a bag, but it was a very small one."\r\n\r\n"Large enough to hold a dress?"\r\n\r\n"O no, sir."\r\n\r\n"And Mr. Van Burnam?"\r\n\r\n"He carried an umbrella; I saw nothing else."\r\n\r\n"Why did they not leave together? Did you hear any one say?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I heard them say Mrs. Van Burnam came against her husband\'s\r\nwishes. He did not want her to leave Haddam, but she would, and he was\r\nnone too pleased at it. Indeed they had words about it, and as both our\r\nrooms overlook the same veranda, I could not help hearing some of their\r\ntalk."\r\n\r\n"Will you tell us what you heard?"\r\n\r\n"It does not seem right" (thus this honest woman spoke), "but if it\'s\r\nthe law, I must not go against it. I heard him say these words: \'I have\r\nchanged my mind, Louise. The more I think of it, the more disinclined I\r\nam to have you meddle in the matter. Besides, it will do no good. You\r\nwill only add to the prejudice against you, and our life will become\r\nmore unbearable than it is now.\'"\r\n\r\n"Of what were they speaking?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know."\r\n\r\n"And what did she reply?"\r\n\r\n"O, she uttered a torrent of words that had less sense in them than\r\nfeeling. She wanted to go, she would go, _she_ had not changed _her_\r\nmind, and considered that her impulses were as well worth following as\r\nhis cool judgment. She was not happy, had never been happy, and meant\r\nthere should be a change, even if it were for the worse. But she did not\r\nbelieve it would be for the worse. Was she not pretty? Was she not very\r\npretty when in distress and looking up thus? And I heard her fall on her\r\nknees, a movement which called out a grunt from her husband, but whether\r\nthis was an expression of approval or disapproval I cannot say. A\r\nsilence followed, during which I caught the sound of his steady tramping\r\nup and down the room. Then she spoke again in a petulant way. \'It may\r\nseem foolish to _you_\' she cried, \'knowing me as you do, and being used\r\nto seeing me in all my moods. But to him it will be a surprise, and I\r\nwill so manage it that it will effect all we want, and more, too,\r\nperhaps. I--I have a genius for some things, Howard; and my better angel\r\ntells me I shall succeed.\'"\r\n\r\n"And what did he reply to that?"\r\n\r\n"That the name of her better angel was Vanity; that his father would see\r\nthrough her blandishments; that he forbade her to prosecute her schemes;\r\nand much more to the same effect. To all of which she answered by a\r\nvigorous stamp of her foot, and the declaration that she was going to do\r\nwhat she thought best in spite of all opposition; that it was a lover,\r\nand not a tyrant that she had married, and that if he did not know what\r\nwas good for himself, she did, and that when he received an intimation\r\nfrom his father that the breach in the family was closed, then he would\r\nacknowledge that if she had no fortune and no connections, she had at\r\nleast a plentiful supply of wit. Upon which he remarked: \'A poor\r\nqualification when it verges upon folly!\' which seemed to close the\r\nconversation, for I heard no more till the sound of her skirts rustling\r\npast my door assured me she had carried her point and was leaving the\r\nhouse. But this was not done without great discomfiture to her husband,\r\nif one may judge from the few brief but emphatic words that escaped him\r\nbefore he closed his own door and followed her down the hall."\r\n\r\n"Do you remember those words?"\r\n\r\n"They were swear words, sir; I am sorry to say it, but he certainly\r\ncursed her and his own folly. Yet I always thought he loved her."\r\n\r\n"Did you see her after she passed your door?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, on the walk outside."\r\n\r\n"Was she then on the way to the train?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Carrying the bag of which you have spoken?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; another proof of the state of feeling between them, for he\r\nwas very considerate in his treatment of ladies, and I never saw him do\r\nanything ungallant before."\r\n\r\n"You say you watched her as she went down the walk?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; it is human nature, sir; I have no other excuse to offer."\r\n\r\nIt was an apology I myself might have made. I conceived a liking for\r\nthis homely matter-of-fact woman.\r\n\r\n"Did you note her dress?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; that is human nature also, or, rather, woman\'s nature."\r\n\r\n"Particularly, madam; so that you can describe it to the jury before\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"I think so."\r\n\r\n"Will you, then, be good enough to tell us what sort of a dress Mrs. Van\r\nBurnam wore when she left your house for the city?"\r\n\r\n"It was a black and white plaid silk, very rich----"\r\n\r\nWhy, what did this mean? We had all expected a very different\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n"It was made fashionably, and the sleeves--well, it is impossible to\r\ndescribe the sleeves. She wore no wrap, which seemed foolish to me, for\r\nwe have very sudden changes sometimes in September."\r\n\r\n"A plaid dress! And did you notice her hat?"\r\n\r\n"O, I have seen the hat often. It was of every conceivable color. It\r\nwould have been called bad taste at one time, but now-a-days----"\r\n\r\nThe pause was significant. More than one man in the room chuckled, but\r\nthe women kept a discreet silence.\r\n\r\n"Would you know that hat if you saw it?"\r\n\r\n"I should think I would!"\r\n\r\nThe emphasis was that of a countrywoman, and amused some people\r\nnotwithstanding the melodious tone in which it was uttered. But it did\r\nnot amuse me; my thoughts had flown to the hat which Mr. Gryce had found\r\nin the third room of Mr. Van Burnam\'s house, and which was of every\r\ncolor of the rainbow.\r\n\r\nThe Coroner asked two other questions, one in regard to the gloves worn\r\nby Mrs. Van Burnam, and the other in regard to her shoes. To the first,\r\nMiss Ferguson replied that she did not notice her gloves, and to the\r\nother, that Mrs. Van Burnam was very fashionable, and as pointed shoes\r\nwere the fashion, in cities at least, she probably wore pointed shoes.\r\n\r\nThe discovery that Mrs. Van Burnam had been differently dressed on that\r\nday from the young woman found dead in the Van Burnam parlors, had acted\r\nas a shock upon most of the spectators. They were just beginning to\r\nrecover from it when Miss Ferguson sat down. The Coroner was the only\r\none who had not seemed at a loss. Why, we were soon destined to know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nTHE ORDER CLERK.\r\n\r\n\r\nA lady well known in New York society was the next person summoned. She\r\nwas a friend of the Van Burnam family, and had known Howard from\r\nchildhood. She had not liked his marriage; indeed, she rather\r\nparticipated in the family feeling against it, but when young Mrs. Van\r\nBurnam came to her house on the preceding Monday, and begged the\r\nprivilege of remaining with her for one night, she had not had the heart\r\nto refuse her. Mrs. Van Burnam had therefore slept in her house on\r\nMonday night.\r\n\r\nQuestioned in regard to that lady\'s appearance and manner, she answered\r\nthat her guest was unnaturally cheerful, laughing much and showing a\r\ngreat vivacity; that she gave no reason for her good spirits, nor did\r\nshe mention her own affairs in any way,--rather took pains not to do so.\r\n\r\n"How long did she stay?"\r\n\r\n"Till the next morning."\r\n\r\n"And how was she dressed?"\r\n\r\n"Just as Miss Ferguson has described."\r\n\r\n"Did she bring her hand-bag to your house?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and left it there. We found it in her room after she was gone."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! And how do you account for that?"\r\n\r\n"She was preoccupied. I saw it in her cheerfulness, which was forced and\r\nnot always well timed."\r\n\r\n"And where is that bag now?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Van Burnam has it. We kept it for a day and as she did not call for\r\nit, sent it down to the office on Wednesday morning."\r\n\r\n"Before you had heard of the murder?"\r\n\r\n"O yes, before I had heard anything about the murder."\r\n\r\n"As she was your guest, you probably accompanied her to the door?"\r\n\r\n"I did, sir."\r\n\r\n"Did you notice her hands? Can you say what was the color of her\r\ngloves?"\r\n\r\n"I do not think she wore any gloves on leaving; it was very warm, and\r\nshe held them in her hand. I remembered this, for I noticed the sparkle\r\nof her rings as she turned to say good-bye."\r\n\r\n"Ah, you saw her rings!"\r\n\r\n"Distinctly."\r\n\r\n"So that when she left you she was dressed in a black and white plaid\r\nsilk, had a large hat covered with flowers on her head, and wore rings?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\nAnd with these words ringing in the ears of the jury, the witness sat\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nWhat was coming? Something important, or the Coroner would not look so\r\nsatisfied, or the faces of the officials about him so expectant. I\r\nwaited with great but subdued eagerness for the testimony of the next\r\nwitness, who was a young man by the name of Callahan.\r\n\r\nI don\'t like young men in general. They are either over-suave and\r\npolite, as if they condescended to remember that you are elderly and\r\nthat it is their duty to make you forget it, or else they are pert and\r\nshallow and disgust you with their egotism. But this young man looked\r\nsensible and business-like, and I took to him at once, though what\r\nconnection he could have with this affair I could not imagine.\r\n\r\nHis first words, however, settled all questions as to his personality:\r\nHe was the order clerk at Altman\'s.\r\n\r\nAs he acknowledged this, I seemed to have some faint premonition of what\r\nwas coming. Perhaps I had not been without some vague idea of the truth\r\never since I had put my mind to work on this matter; perhaps my wits\r\nonly received their real spur then; but certainly I knew what he was\r\ngoing to say as soon as he opened his lips, which gave me quite a good\r\nopinion of myself, whether rightfully or not, I leave you to judge.\r\n\r\nHis evidence was short, but very much to the point. On the seventeenth\r\nof September, as could be verified by the books, the firm had received\r\nan order for a woman\'s complete outfit, to be sent, C.O.D., to Mrs.\r\nJames Pope at the Hotel D----, on Broadway. Sizes and measures and some\r\nparticulars were stated, and as the order bore the words _In haste_\r\nunderlined upon it, several clerks had assisted him in filling this\r\norder, which when filled had been sent by special messenger to the place\r\ndesignated.\r\n\r\nHad he this order with him?\r\n\r\nHe had.\r\n\r\nAnd could he identify the articles sent to fill it?\r\n\r\nHe could.\r\n\r\nAt which the Coroner motioned to an officer and a pile of clothing was\r\nbrought forward from some mysterious corner and laid before the witness.\r\n\r\nImmediately expectation rose to a high pitch, for every one recognized,\r\nor thought he did, the apparel which had been taken from the victim.\r\n\r\nThe young man, who was of the alert, nervous type, took up the articles\r\none by one and examined them closely.\r\n\r\nAs he did so, the whole assembled crowd surged forward and\r\nlightning-like glances from a hundred eyes followed his every movement\r\nand expression.\r\n\r\n"Are they the same?" inquired the Coroner.\r\n\r\nThe witness did not hesitate. With one quick glance at the blue serge\r\ndress, black cape, and battered hat, he answered in a firm tone:\r\n\r\n"They are."\r\n\r\nAnd a clue was given at last to the dreadful mystery absorbing us.\r\n\r\nThe deep-drawn sigh which swept through the room testified to the\r\nuniversal satisfaction; then our attention became fixed again, for the\r\nCoroner, pointing to the undergarments accompanying the articles already\r\nmentioned, demanded if they had been included in the order.\r\n\r\nThere was as little hesitation in the reply given to this question as to\r\nthe former. He recognized each piece as having come from his\r\nestablishment. "You will note," said he, "that they have never been\r\nwashed, and that the pencil marks are still on them."\r\n\r\n"Very good," observed the Coroner, "and you will note that one article\r\nthere is torn down the back. Was it in that condition when sent?"\r\n\r\n"It was not, sir."\r\n\r\n"All were in perfect order?"\r\n\r\n"Most assuredly, sir."\r\n\r\n"Very good, again. The jury will take cognizance of this fact, which may\r\nbe useful to them in their future conclusions. And now, Mr. Callahan, do\r\nyou notice anything lacking here from the list of articles forwarded by\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"Yet there is one very necessary adjunct to a woman\'s outfit which is\r\nnot to be found here."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, the shoes; but I am not surprised at that. We sent shoes, but\r\nthey were not satisfactory, and they were returned."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I see. Officer, show the witness the shoes that were taken from the\r\ndeceased."\r\n\r\nThis was done, and when Mr. Callahan had examined them, the Coroner\r\ninquired if they came from his store. He replied no.\r\n\r\nWhereupon they were held up to the jury, and attention called to the\r\nfact that, while rather new than old, they gave signs of having been\r\nworn more than once; which was not true of anything else taken from the\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\nThis matter settled, the Coroner proceeded with his questions.\r\n\r\n"Who carried the articles ordered, to the address given?"\r\n\r\n"A man in our employ, named Clapp."\r\n\r\n"Did he bring back the amount of the bill?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; less the five dollars charged for the shoes."\r\n\r\n"What was the amount, may I ask?"\r\n\r\n"Here is our cash-book, sir. The amount received from Mrs. James Pope,\r\nHotel D----, on the seventeenth of September, is, as you see,\r\nseventy-five dollars and fifty-eight cents."\r\n\r\n"Let the jury see the book; also the order."\r\n\r\nThey were both handed to the jury, and if ever I wished myself in any\r\none\'s shoes, save my own very substantial ones, it was at that moment. I\r\ndid so want a peep at that order.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to interest the jury also, for their heads drew together very\r\neagerly over it, and some whispers and a few knowing looks passed\r\nbetween them. Finally one of them spoke:\r\n\r\n"It is written in a very odd hand. Do you call this a woman\'s writing or\r\na man\'s?"\r\n\r\n"I have no opinion to give on the subject," rejoined the witness. "It is\r\nintelligible writing, and that is all that comes within my province."\r\n\r\nThe twelve men shifted on their seats and surveyed the Coroner eagerly.\r\nWhy did he not proceed? Evidently he was not quick enough to suit them.\r\n\r\n"Have you any further questions for this witness?" asked that gentleman\r\nafter a short delay.\r\n\r\nTheir nervousness increased, but no one ventured to follow the Coroner\'s\r\nsuggestion. A poor lot, I call them, a very poor lot! I would have found\r\nplenty of questions to put to him.\r\n\r\nI expected to see the man Clapp called next, but I was disappointed in\r\nthis. The name uttered was Henshaw, and the person who rose in answer to\r\nit was a tall, burly man with a shock of curly black hair. He was the\r\nclerk of the Hotel D----, and we all forgot Clapp in our eagerness to\r\nhear what this man had to say.\r\n\r\nHis testimony amounted to this:\r\n\r\nThat a person by the name of Pope was registered on his books. That she\r\ncame to his house on the seventeenth of September, some time near noon.\r\nThat she was not alone; that a person she called her husband accompanied\r\nher, and that they had been given a room, at her request, on the second\r\nfloor overlooking Broadway.\r\n\r\n"Did you see the husband? Was it his handwriting we see in your\r\nregister?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir. He came into the office, but he did not approach the desk. It\r\nwas she who registered for them both, and who did all the business in\r\nfact. I thought it queer, but took it for granted he was ill, for he\r\nheld his head very much down, and acted as if he felt disturbed or\r\nanxious."\r\n\r\n"Did you notice him closely? Would you be able to identify him on\r\nsight?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir, I should not. He looked like a hundred other men I see every\r\nday: medium in height and build, with brown hair and brown moustache.\r\nNot noticeable in any way, sir, except for his hang-dog air and evident\r\ndesire not to be noticed."\r\n\r\n"But you saw him later?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir. After he went to his room he stayed there, and no one saw him.\r\nI did not even see him when he left the house. His wife paid the bill\r\nand he did not come into the office."\r\n\r\n"But you saw her well; you would know her again?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, sir; but I doubt it. She wore a thick veil when she came in,\r\nand though I might remember her voice, I have no recollection of her\r\nfeatures for I did not see them."\r\n\r\n"You can give a description of her dress, though; surely you must have\r\nlooked long enough at a woman who wrote her own and her husband\'s name\r\nin your register, for you to remember her clothes."\r\n\r\n"Yes, for they were very simple. She had on what is called a gossamer,\r\nwhich covered her from neck to toe, and on her head a hat wrapped all\r\nabout with a blue veil."\r\n\r\n"So that she might have worn any dress under that gossamer?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"And any hat under that veil?"\r\n\r\n"Any one that was large enough, sir."\r\n\r\n"_Very_ good. Now, did you see her hands?"\r\n\r\n"Not to remember them."\r\n\r\n"Did she have gloves on?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot say. I did not stand and watch her, sir."\r\n\r\n"That is a pity. But you say you heard her voice."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Was it a lady\'s voice? Was her tone refined and her language good?"\r\n\r\n"They were, sir."\r\n\r\n"When did they leave? How long did they remain in your house?"\r\n\r\n"They left in the evening; after tea, I should say."\r\n\r\n"How? On foot or in a carriage?"\r\n\r\n"In a carriage; one of the hacks that stand in front of the door."\r\n\r\n"Did they bring any baggage with them?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"Did they take any away?"\r\n\r\n"The lady carried a parcel."\r\n\r\n"What kind of a parcel?"\r\n\r\n"A brown-paper parcel, like clothing done up."\r\n\r\n"And the gentleman?"\r\n\r\n"I did not see him."\r\n\r\n"Was she dressed the same in going as in coming?"\r\n\r\n"To all appearance, except her hat. That was smaller."\r\n\r\n"She had the gossamer on still, then?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"And a veil?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Only that the hat it covered was smaller?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"And now, how did you account to yourself for the parcel and the change\r\nof hat?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t account for them. I didn\'t think anything about them at the\r\ntime; but, since I have had the subject brought to my mind, I find it\r\neasy enough. She had a package delivered to her while she was in our\r\nhouse, or rather packages; they were quite numerous, I believe."\r\n\r\n"Can you recall the circumstances of their delivery?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; the man who brought the packages said that they had not been\r\npaid for, so I allowed him to carry them to Mrs. James Pope\'s room. When\r\nhe went away, he had but one small parcel with him; the rest he had\r\nleft."\r\n\r\n"And this is all you can tell us about this singular couple? Had they no\r\nmeals in your house?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir; the gentleman--or I suppose I should say the lady, sir, for\r\nthe order was given in her voice--sent for two dozen oysters and a\r\nbottle of ale, which were furnished to them in their rooms; but they\r\ndidn\'t come to the dining-room."\r\n\r\n"Is the boy here who carried up those articles?"\r\n\r\n"He is, sir."\r\n\r\n"And the chambermaid who attended to their rooms?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Then you may answer this question, and we will excuse you. How was the\r\ngentleman dressed when you saw him?"\r\n\r\n"In a linen duster and a felt hat."\r\n\r\n"Let the jury remember that. And now let us hear from Richard Clapp. Is\r\nRichard Clapp in the room?"\r\n\r\n"I am, sir," answered a cheery voice; and a lively young man with a\r\nshrewd eye and a wide-awake manner popped up from behind a portly woman\r\non a side seat and rapidly came forward.\r\n\r\nHe was asked several questions before the leading one which we all\r\nexpected; but I will not record them here. The question which brought\r\nthe reply most eagerly anticipated was this:\r\n\r\n"Do you remember being sent to the Hotel D----with several packages for\r\na Mrs. James Pope?"\r\n\r\n"I do, sir."\r\n\r\n"Did you deliver them in person? Did you see the lady?"\r\n\r\nA peculiar look crossed his face and we all leaned forward. But his\r\nanswer brought a shock of disappointment with it.\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t, sir. She wouldn\'t let me in. She bade me lay the things\r\ndown by the door and wait in the rear hall till she called me."\r\n\r\n"And you did this?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"But you kept your eye on the door, of course?"\r\n\r\n"Naturally, sir."\r\n\r\n"And saw----"\r\n\r\n"A hand steal out and take in the things."\r\n\r\n"A woman\'s hand?"\r\n\r\n"No; a man\'s. I saw the white cuff."\r\n\r\n"And how long was it before they called you?"\r\n\r\n"Fifteen minutes, I should say. I heard a voice cry \'Here!\' and seeing\r\ntheir door open, I went toward it. But by the time I reached it, it was\r\nshut again, and I only heard the lady say that all the articles but the\r\nshoes were satisfactory, and would I thrust the bill in under the door.\r\nI did so, and they were some minutes counting out the change, but\r\npresently the door opened slightly, and I saw a man\'s hand holding out\r\nthe money, which was correct to the cent. \'You need not receipt the\r\nbill,\' cried the lady from somewhere in the room. \'Give him the shoes\r\nand let him go.\' So I received the shoes in the same mysterious way I\r\nhad the money, and seeing no reason for waiting longer, pocketed the\r\nbills and returned to the store."\r\n\r\n"Has the jury any further questions to ask the witness?"\r\n\r\nOf course not. They were ninnies, all of them, and----But, contrary to\r\nmy expectation, one of them did perk up courage, and, wriggling very\r\nmuch on his seat, ventured to ask if the cuff he had seen on the man\'s\r\nhand when it was thrust through the doorway had a button in it.\r\n\r\nThe answer was disappointing. The witness had not noticed any.\r\n\r\nThe juror, somewhat abashed, sank into silence, at which another of the\r\nprecious twelve, inspired no doubt by the other\'s example, blurted out:\r\n\r\n"Then what was the color of the coat sleeve? You surely can remember\r\nthat."\r\n\r\nBut another disappointment awaited us.\r\n\r\n"He did not wear any coat. It was a shirt sleeve I saw."\r\n\r\nA shirt sleeve! There was no clue in that. A visible look of dejection\r\nspread through the room, which was not dissipated till another witness\r\nstood up.\r\n\r\nThis time it was the bell-boy of the hotel who had been on duty that\r\nday. His testimony was brief, and added but little to the general\r\nknowledge. He had been summoned more than once by these mysterious\r\nparties, but only to receive his orders through a closed door. He had\r\nnot entered the room at all.\r\n\r\nHe was followed by the chambermaid, who testified that she was in the\r\nroom once while they were there; that she saw them both then, but did\r\nnot catch a glimpse of their faces; Mr. Pope was standing in the window\r\nalmost entirely shielded by the curtains, and Mrs. Pope was busy hanging\r\nup something in the wardrobe. The gentleman had on his duster and the\r\nlady her gossamer; it was but a few minutes after their arrival.\r\n\r\nQuestioned in regard to the state of the room after they left it, she\r\nsaid that there was a lot of brown paper lying about, marked B. Altman,\r\nbut nothing else that did not belong there.\r\n\r\n"Not a tag, nor a hat-pin, nor a bit of memorandum, lying on bureau or\r\ntable?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, sir, so far as I mind. I wasn\'t on the look-out for anything,\r\nsir. They were a queer couple, but we have lots of queer couples at our\r\nhouse, and the most I notices, sir, is those what remember the\r\nchambermaid and those what don\'t. This couple was of the kind what\r\ndon\'t."\r\n\r\n"Did you sweep the room after their departure?"\r\n\r\n"I always does. They went late, so I swept the room the next morning."\r\n\r\n"And threw the sweepings away, of course?"\r\n\r\n"Of course; would you have me keep them for treasures?"\r\n\r\n"It might have been well if you had," muttered the Coroner. "The\r\ncombings from the lady\'s hair might have been very useful in\r\nestablishing her identity."\r\n\r\nThe porter who has charge of the lady\'s entrance was the last witness\r\nfrom this house. He had been on duty on the evening in question and had\r\nnoticed this couple leaving. They both carried packages, and had\r\nattracted his attention first, by the long, old-fashioned duster which\r\nthe gentleman wore, and secondly, by the pains they both took not to be\r\nobserved by any one. The woman was veiled, as had already been said, and\r\nthe man held his package in such a way as to shield his face entirely\r\nfrom observation.\r\n\r\n"So that you would not know him if you saw him again?" asked the\r\nCoroner.\r\n\r\n"Exactly, sir," was the uncomprising answer.\r\n\r\nAs he sat down, the Coroner observed: "You will note from this\r\ntestimony, gentlemen, that this couple, signing themselves Mr. and Mrs.\r\nJames Pope of Philadelphia, left this house dressed each in a long\r\ngarment eminently fitted for purposes of concealment,--he in a linen\r\nduster, and she in a gossamer. Let us now follow this couple a little\r\nfarther and see what became of these disguising articles of apparel. Is\r\nSeth Brown here?"\r\n\r\nA man, who was so evidently a hackman that it seemed superfluous to ask\r\nhim what his occupation was, shuffled forward at this.\r\n\r\nIt was in his hack that this couple had left the D----. He remembered\r\nthem very well as he had good reason to. First, because the man paid him\r\nbefore entering the carriage, saying that he was to let them out at the\r\nnorthwest corner of Madison Square, and secondly----But here the Coroner\r\ninterrupted him to ask if he had seen the gentleman\'s face when he paid\r\nhim. The answer was, as might have been expected, No. It was dark, and\r\nhe had not turned his head.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you think it queer to be paid before you reached your\r\ndestination?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but the rest was queerer. After I had taken the money--I never\r\nrefuses money, sir--and was expecting him to get into the hack, he steps\r\nup to me again and says in a lower tone than before: \'My wife is very\r\nnervous. Drive slow, if you please, and when you reach the place I have\r\nnamed, watch your horses carefully, for if they should move while she is\r\ngetting out, the shock would throw her into a spasm.\' As she had looked\r\nvery pert and lively, I thought this mighty queer, and I tried to get a\r\npeep at his face, but he was too smart for me, and was in the carriage\r\nbefore I could clap my eye on him."\r\n\r\n"But you were more fortunate when they got out? You surely saw one or\r\nboth of them then?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir, I didn\'t. I had to watch the horses\' heads, you know. I\r\nshouldn\'t like to be the cause of a young lady having a spasm."\r\n\r\n"Do you know in what direction they went?"\r\n\r\n"East, I should say. I heard them laughing long after I had whipped up\r\nmy horses. A queer couple, sir, that puzzled me some, though I should\r\nnot have thought of them twice if I had not found next day----"\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"The gentleman\'s linen duster and the neat brown gossamer which the lady\r\nhad worn, lying folded under the two back cushions of my hack; a present\r\nfor which I was very much obliged to them, but which I was not long\r\nallowed to enjoy, for yesterday the police----"\r\n\r\n"Well, well, no matter about that. Here is a duster and here is a brown\r\ngossamer. Are these the articles you found under your cushions?"\r\n\r\n"If you will examine the neck of the lady\'s gossamer, you can soon tell,\r\nsir. There was a small hole in the one I found, as if something had been\r\nsnipped out of it; the owner\'s name, most likely."\r\n\r\n"Or the name of the place where it was bought," suggested the Coroner,\r\nholding the garment up to view so as to reveal a square hole under the\r\ncollar.\r\n\r\n"That\'s it!" cried the hackman. "That\'s the very one. Shame, I say, to\r\nspoil a new garment that way."\r\n\r\n"Why do you call it new?" asked the Coroner.\r\n\r\n"Because it hasn\'t a mud spot or even a mark of dust upon it. We looked\r\nit all over, my wife and I, and decided it had not been long off the\r\nshelf. A pretty good haul for a poor man like me, and if the police----"\r\n\r\nBut here he was cut short again by an important question:\r\n\r\n"There is a clock but a short distance from the place where you\r\nstopped. Did you notice what time it was when you drove away?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. I don\'t know why I remember it, but I do. As I turned to go\r\nback to the hotel, I looked up at this clock. It was half-past eleven."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\nTHE KEYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were all by this time greatly interested in the proceedings; and when\r\nanother hackman was called we recognized at once that an effort was\r\nabout to be made to connect this couple with the one who had alighted at\r\nMr. Van Burnam\'s door.\r\n\r\nThe witness, who was a melancholy chap, kept his stand on the east side\r\nof the Square. At about twenty minutes to twelve, he was awakened from a\r\nnap he had been taking on the top of his coach, by a sharp rap on his\r\nwhip arm, and looking down, he saw a lady and gentleman standing at the\r\ndoor of his vehicle.\r\n\r\n"We want to go to Gramercy Park," said the lady. "Drive us there at\r\nonce."\r\n\r\n"I nodded, for what is the use of wasting words when it can be avoided;\r\nand they stepped at once into the coach."\r\n\r\n"Can you describe them--tell us how they looked?"\r\n\r\n"I never notice people; besides, it was dark; but he had a swell air,\r\nand she was pert and merry, for she laughed as she closed the door."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you remember how they were dressed?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir; she had on something that flapped about her shoulders, and he\r\nhad a dark hat on his head, but that was all I saw."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you see his face?"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit of it; he kept it turned away. He didn\'t want nobody looking\r\nat _him_. She did all the business."\r\n\r\n"Then you saw _her_ face?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, for a minute. But I wouldn\'t know it again. She was young and\r\npurty, and her hand which dropped the money into mine was small, but I\r\ncouldn\'t say no more, not if you was to give me the town."\r\n\r\n"Did you know that the house you stopped at was Mr. Van Burnam\'s, and\r\nthat it was supposed to be empty?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir, I\'m not one of the swell ones. My acquaintances live in\r\nanother part of the town."\r\n\r\n"But you noticed that the house was dark?"\r\n\r\n"I may have. I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"And that is all you have to tell us about them?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir; the next morning, which was yesterday, sir, as I was a-dusting\r\nout the coach I found under the cushions a large blue veil, folded and\r\nlying very flat. But it had been slit with a knife and could not be\r\nworn."\r\n\r\nThis was strange too, and while more than one person about me ventured\r\nan opinion, I muttered to myself, "James Pope, his mark!" astonished at\r\na coincidence which so completely connected the occupants of the two\r\ncoaches.\r\n\r\nBut the Coroner was able to produce a witness whose evidence carried the\r\nmatter on still farther. A policeman in full uniform testified next, and\r\nafter explaining that his beat led him from Madison Avenue to Third on\r\nTwenty-seventh Street, went on to say that as he was coming up this\r\nstreet on Tuesday evening some few minutes before midnight, he\r\nencountered, somewhere between Lexington Avenue and Third, a man and\r\nwoman walking rapidly towards the latter avenue, each carrying a parcel\r\nof some dimensions; that he noted them because they seemed so merry, but\r\nwould have thought nothing of it, if he had not presently perceived them\r\ncoming back without the parcels. They were chatting more gaily than\r\never. The lady wore a short cape, and the gentleman a dark coat, but he\r\ncould give no other description of their appearance, for they went by\r\nrapidly, and he was more interested in wondering what they had done with\r\nsuch large parcels in such a short time at that hour of night, than in\r\nnoting how they looked or whither they were going. He did observe,\r\nhowever, that they proceeded towards Madison Square, and remembers now\r\nthat he heard a carriage suddenly drive away from that direction.\r\n\r\nThe Coroner asked him but one question:\r\n\r\n"Had the lady no parcel when you saw her last?"\r\n\r\n"I saw none."\r\n\r\n"Could she not have carried one under her cape?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, if it was small enough."\r\n\r\n"As small as a lady\'s hat, say?"\r\n\r\n"Well, it would have to be smaller than some of them are now, sir."\r\n\r\nAnd so terminated this portion of the inquiry.\r\n\r\nA short delay followed the withdrawal of this witness. The Coroner, who\r\nwas a somewhat portly man, and who had felt the heat of the day very\r\nmuch, leaned back and looked anxious, while the jury, always restless,\r\nmoved in their seats like a set of school-boys, and seemed to long for\r\nthe hour of adjournment, notwithstanding the interest which everybody\r\nbut themselves seemed to take in this exciting investigation.\r\n\r\nFinally an officer, who had been sent into the adjoining room, came back\r\nwith a gentleman, who was no sooner recognized as Mr. Franklin Van\r\nBurnam than a great change took place in the countenances of all\r\npresent. The Coroner sat forward and dropped the large palm-leaf fan he\r\nhad been industriously using for the last few minutes, the jury settled\r\ndown, and the whispering of the many curious ones about me grew less\r\naudible and finally ceased altogether. A gentleman of the family was\r\nabout to be interrogated, and such a gentleman!\r\n\r\nI have purposely refrained from describing this best known and best\r\nreputed member of the Van Burnam family, foreseeing this hour when he\r\nwould attract the attention of a hundred eyes and when his appearance\r\nwould require our special notice. I will therefore endeavor to picture\r\nhim to you as he looked on this memorable morning, with just the simple\r\nwarning that you must not expect me to see with the eyes of a young girl\r\nor even with those of a fashionable society woman. I know a man when I\r\nsee him, and I had always regarded Mr. Franklin as an exceptionally\r\nfine-looking and prepossessing gentleman, but I shall not go into\r\nraptures, as I heard a girl behind me doing, nor do I feel like\r\nacknowledging him as a paragon of all the virtues--as Mrs. Cunningham\r\ndid that evening in my parlor.\r\n\r\nHe is a medium-sized man, with a shape not unlike his brother\'s. His\r\nhair is dark and so are his eyes, but his moustache is brown and his\r\ncomplexion quite fair. He carries himself with distinction, and though\r\nhis countenance in repose has a precise air that is not perfectly\r\nagreeable, it has, when he speaks or smiles, an expression at once keen\r\nand amiable.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion he failed to smile, and though his elegance was\r\nsufficiently apparent, his worth was not so much so. Yet the impression\r\ngenerally made was favorable, as one could perceive from the air of\r\nrespect with which his testimony was received.\r\n\r\nHe was asked many questions. Some were germane to the matter in hand and\r\nsome seemed to strike wide of all mark. He answered them all\r\ncourteously, showing a manly composure in doing so, that served to calm\r\nthe fever-heat into which many had been thrown by the stories of the two\r\nhackmen. But as his evidence up to this point related merely to minor\r\nconcerns, this was neither strange nor conclusive. The real test began\r\nwhen the Coroner, with a certain bluster, which may have been meant to\r\nattract the attention of the jury, now visibly waning, or, as was more\r\nlikely, may have been the unconscious expression of a secret if hitherto\r\nwell concealed embarrassment, asked the witness whether the keys to his\r\nfather\'s front door had any duplicates.\r\n\r\nThe answer came in a decidedly changed tone. "No. The key used by our\r\nagent opens the basement door only."\r\n\r\nThe Coroner showed his satisfaction. "No duplicates," he repeated; "then\r\nyou will have no difficulty in telling us where the keys to your\r\nfather\'s front door were kept during the family\'s absence."\r\n\r\nDid the young man hesitate, or was it but imagination on my part--"They\r\nwere usually in my possession."\r\n\r\n"Usually!" There was irony in the tone; evidently the Coroner was\r\ngetting the better of his embarrassment, if he had felt any. "And where\r\nwere they on the seventeenth of this month? Were they in your possession\r\nthen?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir." The young man tried to look calm and at his ease, but the\r\ndifficulty he felt in doing so was apparent. "On the morning of that\r\nday," he continued, "I passed them over to my brother."\r\n\r\nAh! here was something tangible as well as important. I began to fear\r\nthe police understood themselves only too well; and so did the whole\r\ncrowd of persons there assembled. A groan in one direction was answered\r\nby a sigh in another, and it needed all the Coroner\'s authority to\r\nprevent an outbreak.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Van Burnam stood erect and unwavering, though his eye\r\nshowed the suffering which these demonstrations awakened. He did not\r\nturn in the direction of the room where we felt sure his family was\r\ngathered, but it was evident that his thoughts did, and that most\r\npainfully. The Coroner, on the contrary, showed little or no feeling; he\r\nhad brought the investigation up to this critical point and felt fully\r\ncompetent to carry it farther.\r\n\r\n"May I ask," said he, "where the transference of these keys took place?"\r\n\r\n"I gave them to him in our office last Tuesday morning. He said he might\r\nwant to go into the house before his father came home."\r\n\r\n"Did he say why he wanted to go into the house?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Was he in the habit of going into it alone and during the family\'s\r\nabsence?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Had he any clothes there? or any articles belonging to himself or his\r\nwife which he would be likely to wish to carry away?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Yet he wanted to go in?"\r\n\r\n"He said so."\r\n\r\n"And you gave him the keys without question?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly, sir."\r\n\r\n"Was that not opposed to your usual principles--to your way of doing\r\nthings, I should say?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps; but principles, by which I suppose you mean my usual business\r\nmethods, do not govern me in my relations with my brother. He asked me a\r\nfavor, and I granted it. It would have to have been a much larger one\r\nfor me to have asked an explanation from him before doing so."\r\n\r\n"Yet you are not on good terms with your brother; at least you have not\r\nhad the name of being, for some time?"\r\n\r\n"We have had no quarrel."\r\n\r\n"Did he return the keys you lent him?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Have you seen them since?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Would you know them if they were shown you?"\r\n\r\n"I would know them if they unlocked our front door."\r\n\r\n"But you would not know them on sight?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think so."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Van Burnam, it is disagreeable for me to go into family matters,\r\nbut if you have had no quarrel with your brother, how comes it that you\r\nand he have had so little intercourse of late?"\r\n\r\n"He has been in Connecticut and I at Long Branch. Is not that a good\r\nanswer, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Good, but not good enough. You have a common office in New York, have\r\nyou not?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly, the firm\'s office."\r\n\r\n"And you sometimes meet there, even while residing in different\r\nlocalities?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, our business calls us in at times and then we meet, of course."\r\n\r\n"Do you talk when you meet?"\r\n\r\n"Talk?"\r\n\r\n"Of other matters besides business, I mean. Are your relations friendly?\r\nDo you show the same spirit towards each other as you did three years\r\nago, say?"\r\n\r\n"We are older; perhaps we are not quite so voluble."\r\n\r\n"But do you feel the same?"\r\n\r\n"No. I see you will have it, and so I will no longer hold back the\r\ntruth. We are not as brotherly in our intercourse as we used to be; but\r\nthere is no animosity between us. I have a decided regard for my\r\nbrother."\r\n\r\nThis was said quite nobly, and I liked him for it, but I began to feel\r\nthat perhaps it had been for the best after all that I had never been\r\nintimate with the family. But I must not forestall either events or my\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\n"Is there any reason"--it is the Coroner, of course, who is\r\nspeaking--"why there should be any falling off in your mutual\r\nconfidence? Has your brother done anything to displease you?"\r\n\r\n"We did not like his marriage."\r\n\r\n"Was it an unhappy one?"\r\n\r\n"It was not a suitable one."\r\n\r\n"Did you know Mrs. Van Burnam well, that you say this?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I knew her, but the rest of the family did not."\r\n\r\n"Yet they shared in your disapprobation?"\r\n\r\n"They felt the marriage more than I did. The lady--excuse me, I never\r\nlike to speak ill of the sex--was not lacking in good sense or virtue,\r\nbut she was not the person we had a right to expect Howard to marry."\r\n\r\n"And you let him see that you thought so?"\r\n\r\n"How could we do otherwise?"\r\n\r\n"Even after she had been his wife for some months?"\r\n\r\n"We could not like her."\r\n\r\n"Did your brother--I am sorry to press this matter--ever show that he\r\nfelt your change of conduct towards him?"\r\n\r\n"I find it equally hard to answer," was the quick reply. "My brother is\r\nof an affectionate nature, and he has some, if not all, of the family\'s\r\npride. I think he did feel it, though he never said so. He is not\r\nwithout loyalty to his wife."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Van Burnam, of whom does the firm doing business under the name of\r\nVan Burnam & Sons consist?"\r\n\r\n"Of the three persons mentioned."\r\n\r\n"No others?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Has there ever been in your hearing any threat made by the senior\r\npartner of dissolving this firm as it stands?"\r\n\r\n"I have heard"--I felt sorry for this strong but far from heartless man,\r\nbut I would not have stopped the inquiry at this point if I could; I\r\nwas far too curious--"I have heard my father say that he would withdraw\r\nif Howard did not. Whether he would have done so, I consider open to\r\ndoubt. My father is a just man and never fails to do the right thing,\r\nthough he sometimes speaks with unnecessary harshness."\r\n\r\n"He made the threat, however?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And Howard heard it?"\r\n\r\n"Or of it; I cannot say which."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Van Burnam, have you noticed any change in your brother since this\r\nthreat was uttered?"\r\n\r\n"How, sir; what change?"\r\n\r\n"In his treatment of his wife, or in his attitude towards yourself?"\r\n\r\n"I have not seen him in the company of his wife since they went to\r\nHaddam. As for his conduct towards myself, I can say no more than I have\r\nalready. We have never forgotten that we are children of one mother."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Van Burnam, how many times have you seen Mrs. Howard Van Burnam?"\r\n\r\n"Several. More frequently before they were married than since."\r\n\r\n"You were in your brother\'s confidence, then, at that time; knew he was\r\ncontemplating marriage?"\r\n\r\n"It was in my endeavors to prevent the match that I saw so much of Miss\r\nLouise Stapleton."\r\n\r\n"Ah! I am glad of the explanation! I was just going to inquire why you,\r\nof all members of the family, were the only one to know your brother\'s\r\nwife by sight."\r\n\r\nThe witness, considering this question answered, made no reply. But the\r\nnext suggestion could not be passed over.\r\n\r\n"If you saw Mrs. Van Burnam so often, you are acquainted with her\r\npersonal appearance?"\r\n\r\n"Sufficiently so; as well as I know that of my ordinary\r\ncalling-acquaintance."\r\n\r\n"Was she light or dark?"\r\n\r\n"She had brown hair."\r\n\r\n"Similar to this?"\r\n\r\nThe lock held up was the one which had been cut from the head of the\r\ndead girl.\r\n\r\n"Yes, somewhat similar to that." The tone was cold; but he could not\r\nhide his distress.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Van Burnam, have you looked well at the woman who was found\r\nmurdered in your father\'s house?"\r\n\r\n"I have, sir."\r\n\r\n"Is there anything in her general outline or in such features as have\r\nescaped disfigurement to remind you of Mrs. Howard Van Burnam?"\r\n\r\n"I may have thought so--at first glance," he replied, with decided\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n"And did you change your mind at the second?"\r\n\r\nHe looked troubled, but answered firmly: "No, I cannot say that I did.\r\nBut you must not regard my opinion as conclusive," he hastily added. "My\r\nknowledge of the lady was comparatively slight."\r\n\r\n"The jury will take that into account. All we want to know now is\r\nwhether you can assert from any knowledge you have or from anything to\r\nbe noted in the body itself, that it is not Mrs. Howard Van Burnam?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot."\r\n\r\nAnd with this solemn assertion his examination closed.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the day was taken up in trying to prove a similarity\r\nbetween Mrs. Van Burnam\'s handwriting and that of Mrs. James Pope as\r\nseen in the register of the Hotel D---- and on the order sent to\r\nAltman\'s. But the only conclusion reached was that the latter might be\r\nthe former disguised, and even on this point the experts differed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\nHOWARD VAN BURNAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gentleman who stepped from the carriage and entered Mr. Van Burnam\'s\r\nhouse at twelve o\'clock that night produced so little impression upon me\r\nthat I went to bed satisfied that no result would follow these efforts\r\nat identification.\r\n\r\nAnd so I told Mr. Gryce when he arrived next morning. But he seemed by\r\nno means disconcerted, and merely requested that I would submit to one\r\nmore trial. To which I gave my consent, and he departed.\r\n\r\nI could have asked him a string of questions, but his manner did not\r\ninvite them, and for some reason I was too wary to show an interest in\r\nthis tragedy superior to that felt by every right-thinking person\r\nconnected with it.\r\n\r\nAt ten o\'clock I was in my old seat in the court-room. The same crowd\r\nwith different faces confronted me, amid which the twelve stolid\r\ncountenances of the jury looked like old friends. Howard Van Burnam was\r\nthe witness called, and as he came forward and stood in full view of us\r\nall, the interest of the occasion reached its climax.\r\n\r\nHis countenance wore a reckless look that did not serve to prepossess\r\nhim with the people at whose mercy he stood. But he did not seem to\r\ncare, and waited for the Coroner\'s questions with an air of ease which\r\nwas in direct contrast to the drawn and troubled faces of his father and\r\nbrother just visible in the background.\r\n\r\nCoroner Dahl surveyed him a few minutes before speaking, then he quietly\r\nasked if he had seen the dead body of the woman who had been found lying\r\nunder a fallen piece of furniture in his father\'s house.\r\n\r\nHe replied that he had.\r\n\r\n"Before she was removed from the house or after it?"\r\n\r\n"After."\r\n\r\n"Did you recognize it? Was it the body of any one you know?"\r\n\r\n"I do not think so."\r\n\r\n"Has your wife, who was missing yesterday, been heard from yet, Mr. Van\r\nBurnam?"\r\n\r\n"Not to my knowledge, sir."\r\n\r\n"Had she not--that is, your wife--a complexion similar to that of the\r\ndead woman just alluded to?"\r\n\r\n"She had a fair skin and brown hair, if that is what you mean. But these\r\nattributes are common to too many women for me to give them any weight\r\nin an attempted identification of this importance."\r\n\r\n"Had they no other similar points of a less general character? Was not\r\nyour wife of a slight and graceful build, such as is attributed to the\r\nsubject of this inquiry?"\r\n\r\n"My wife was slight and she was graceful, common attributes also."\r\n\r\n"And your wife had a scar?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"On the left ankle?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Which the deceased also has?"\r\n\r\n"That I do not know. They say so, but I had no interest in looking."\r\n\r\n"Why, may I ask? Did you not think it a remarkable coincidence?"\r\n\r\nThe young man frowned. It was the first token of feeling he had given.\r\n\r\n"I was not on the look-out for coincidences," was his cold reply. "I had\r\nno reason to think this unhappy victim of an unknown man\'s brutality my\r\nwife, and so did not allow myself to be moved by even such a fact as\r\nthis."\r\n\r\n"You had no reason," repeated the Coroner, "to think this woman your\r\nwife. Had you any reason to think she was not?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Will you give us that reason?"\r\n\r\n"I had more than one. First, my wife would never wear the clothes I saw\r\non the girl whose dead body was shown to me. Secondly, she would never\r\ngo to any house alone with a man at the hour testified to by one of your\r\nwitnesses."[A]\r\n\r\n"Not with any man?"\r\n\r\n"I did not mean to include her husband in my remark, of course. But as I\r\ndid not take her to Gramercy Park, the fact that the deceased woman\r\nentered an empty house accompanied by a man, is proof enough to me that\r\nshe was not Louise Van Burnam."\r\n\r\n"When did you part with your wife?"\r\n\r\n"On Monday morning at the depot in Haddam."\r\n\r\n"Did you know where she was going?"\r\n\r\n"I knew where she said she was going."\r\n\r\n"And where was that, may I ask?"\r\n\r\n"To New York, to interview my father."\r\n\r\n"But your father was not in New York?"\r\n\r\n"He was daily expected here. The steamer on which he had sailed from\r\nSouthampton was due on Tuesday."\r\n\r\n"Had she an interest in seeing your father? Was there any special reason\r\nwhy she should leave you for doing so?"\r\n\r\n"She thought so; she thought he would become reconciled to her entrance\r\ninto our family if he should see her suddenly and without prejudiced\r\npersons standing by."\r\n\r\n"And did you fear to mar the effect of this meeting if you accompanied\r\nher?"\r\n\r\n"No, for I doubted if the meeting would ever take place. I had no\r\nsympathy with her schemes, and did not wish to give her the sanction of\r\nmy presence."\r\n\r\n"Was that the reason you let her go to New York alone?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Had you no other?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Why did you follow her, then, in less than five hours?"\r\n\r\n"Because I was uneasy; because I also wanted to see my father; because I\r\nam a man accustomed to carry out every impulse; and impulse led me that\r\nday in the direction of my somewhat headstrong wife."\r\n\r\n"Did you know where your wife intended to spend the night?"\r\n\r\n"I did not. She has many friends, or at least I have, in the city, and I\r\nconcluded she would go to one of them--as she did."\r\n\r\n"When did you arrive in the city? before ten o\'clock?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, a few minutes before."\r\n\r\n"Did you try to find your wife?"\r\n\r\n"No. I went directly to the club."\r\n\r\n"Did you try to find her the next morning?"\r\n\r\n"No; I had heard that the steamer had not yet been sighted off Fire\r\nIsland, so considered the effort unnecessary."\r\n\r\n"Why? What connection is there between this fact and an endeavor on your\r\npart to find your wife?"\r\n\r\n"A very close one. She had come to New York to throw herself at my\r\nfather\'s feet. Now she could only do this at the steamer or in----"\r\n\r\n"Why do you not proceed, Mr. Van Burnam?"\r\n\r\n"I will. I do not know why I stopped,--or in his own house."\r\n\r\n"In his own house? In the house in Gramercy Park, do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he has no other."\r\n\r\n"The house in which this dead girl was found?"\r\n\r\n"Yes,"--impatiently.\r\n\r\n"Did you think she might throw herself at his feet there?"\r\n\r\n"She said she might; and as she is romantic, foolishly romantic, I\r\nthought her fully capable of doing so."\r\n\r\n"And so you did not seek her in the morning?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"How about the afternoon?"\r\n\r\nThis was a close question; we saw that he was affected by it though he\r\ntried to carry it off bravely.\r\n\r\n"I did not see her in the afternoon. I was in a restless frame of mind,\r\nand did not remain in the city."\r\n\r\n"Ah! indeed! and where did you go?"\r\n\r\n"Unless necessary, I prefer not to say."\r\n\r\n"It is necessary."\r\n\r\n"I went to Coney Island."\r\n\r\n"Alone?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Did you see anybody there you know?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"And when did you return?"\r\n\r\n"At midnight."\r\n\r\n"When did you reach your rooms?"\r\n\r\n"Later."\r\n\r\n"How much later?"\r\n\r\n"Two or three hours."\r\n\r\n"And where were you during those hours?"\r\n\r\n"I was walking the streets."\r\n\r\nThe ease, the quietness with which he made these acknowledgments were\r\nremarkable. The jury to a man honored him with a prolonged stare, and\r\nthe awe-struck crowd scarcely breathed during their utterance. At the\r\nlast sentence a murmur broke out, at which he raised his head and with\r\nan air of surprise surveyed the people before him. Though he must have\r\nknown what their astonishment meant, he neither quailed nor blanched,\r\nand while not in reality a handsome man, he certainly looked handsome at\r\nthis moment.\r\n\r\nI did not know what to think; so forbore to think anything. Meanwhile\r\nthe examination went on.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Van Burnam, I have been told that the locket I see there dangling\r\nfrom your watch-chain contains a lock of your wife\'s hair. Is it so?"\r\n\r\n"I have a lock of her hair in this; yes."\r\n\r\n"Here is a lock clipped from the head of the unknown woman whose\r\nidentity we seek. Have you any objection to comparing the two?"\r\n\r\n"It is not an agreeable task you have set me," was the imperturbable\r\nresponse; "but I have no objection to doing what you ask." And calmly\r\nlifting the chain, he took off the locket, opened it, and held it out\r\ncourteously toward the Coroner. "May I ask you to make the first\r\ncomparison," he said.\r\n\r\nThe Coroner, taking the locket, laid the two locks of brown hair\r\ntogether, and after a moment\'s contemplation of them both, surveyed the\r\nyoung man seriously, and remarked:\r\n\r\n"They are of the same shade. Shall I pass them down to the jury?"\r\n\r\nHoward bowed. You would have thought he was in a drawing-room, and in\r\nthe act of bestowing a favor. But his brother Franklin showed a very\r\ndifferent countenance, and as for their father, one could not even see\r\nhis face, he so persistently held up his hand before it.\r\n\r\nThe jury, wide-awake now, passed the locket along, with many sly nods\r\nand a few whispered words. When it came back to the Coroner, he took it\r\nand handed it to Mr. Van Burnam, saying:\r\n\r\n"I wish you would observe the similarity for yourself. I can hardly\r\ndetect any difference between them."\r\n\r\n"Thank you! I am willing to take your word for it," replied the young\r\nman, with most astonishing _aplomb_. And Coroner and jury for a moment\r\nlooked baffled, and even Mr. Gryce, of whose face I caught a passing\r\nglimpse at this instant, stared at the head of his cane, as if it were\r\nof thicker wood than he expected and had more knotty points on it than\r\neven his accustomed hand liked to encounter.\r\n\r\nAnother effort was not out of place, however; and the Coroner, summoning\r\nup some of the pompous severity he found useful at times, asked the\r\nwitness if his attention had been drawn to the dead woman\'s hands.\r\n\r\nHe acknowledged that it had. "The physician who made the autopsy urged\r\nme to look at them, and I did; they were certainly very like my wife\'s."\r\n\r\n"Only like."\r\n\r\n"I cannot say that they were my wife\'s. Do you wish me to perjure\r\nmyself?"\r\n\r\n"A man should know his wife\'s hands as well as he knows her face."\r\n\r\n"Very likely."\r\n\r\n"And you are ready to swear these were not the hands of your wife?"\r\n\r\n"I am ready to swear I did not so consider them."\r\n\r\n"And that is all?"\r\n\r\n"That is all."\r\n\r\nThe Coroner frowned and cast a glance at the jury. They needed prodding\r\nnow and then, and this is the way he prodded them. As soon as they gave\r\nsigns of recognizing the hint he gave them, he turned back, and renewed\r\nhis examination in these words:\r\n\r\n"Mr. Van Burnam, did your brother at your request hand you the keys of\r\nyour father\'s house on the morning of the day on which this tragedy\r\noccurred?"\r\n\r\n"He did."\r\n\r\n"Have you those keys now?"\r\n\r\n"I have not."\r\n\r\n"What have you done with them? Did you return them to your brother?"\r\n\r\n"No; I see where your inquiries are tending, and I do not suppose you\r\nwill believe my simple word; but I lost the keys on the day I received\r\nthem; that is why----"\r\n\r\n"Well, you may continue, Mr. Van Burnam."\r\n\r\n"I have no more to say; my sentence was not worth completing."\r\n\r\nThe murmur which rose about him seemed to show dissatisfaction; but he\r\nremained imperturbable, or rather like a man who did not hear. I began\r\nto feel a most painful interest in the inquiry, and dreaded, while I\r\nanxiously anticipated, his further examination.\r\n\r\n"You lost the keys; may I ask when and where?"\r\n\r\n"That I do not know; they were missing when I searched for them; missing\r\nfrom my pocket, I mean."\r\n\r\n"Ah! and when did you search for them?"\r\n\r\n"The next day--after I had heard--of--of what had taken place in my\r\nfather\'s house."\r\n\r\nThe hesitations were those of a man weighing his reply. They told on the\r\njury, as all such hesitations do; and made the Coroner lose an atom of\r\nthe respect he had hitherto shown this easy-going witness.\r\n\r\n"And you do not know what became of them?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Or into whose hands they fell?"\r\n\r\n"No, but probably into the hands of the wretch----"\r\n\r\nTo the astonishment of everybody he was on the verge of vehemence; but\r\nbecoming sensible of it, he controlled himself with a suddenness that\r\nwas almost shocking.\r\n\r\n"Find the murderer of this poor girl," said he, with a quiet air that\r\nwas more thrilling than any display of passion, "and ask _him_ where he\r\ngot the keys with which he opened the door of my father\'s house at\r\nmidnight."\r\n\r\nWas this a challenge, or just the natural outburst of an innocent man.\r\nNeither the jury nor the Coroner seemed to know, the former looking\r\nstartled and the latter nonplussed. But Mr. Gryce, who had moved now\r\ninto view, smoothed the head of his cane with quite a loving touch, and\r\ndid not seem at this moment to feel its inequalities objectionable.\r\n\r\n"We will certainly try to follow your advice," the Coroner assured him.\r\n"Meanwhile we must ask how many rings your wife is in the habit of\r\nwearing?"\r\n\r\n"Five. Two on the left hand and three on the right."\r\n\r\n"Do you know these rings?"\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"Better than you know her hands?"\r\n\r\n"As well, sir."\r\n\r\n"Were they on her hands when you parted from her in Haddam?"\r\n\r\n"They were."\r\n\r\n"Did she always wear them?"\r\n\r\n"Almost always. Indeed I do not ever remember seeing her take off more\r\nthan one of them."\r\n\r\n"Which one?"\r\n\r\n"The ruby with the diamond setting."\r\n\r\n"Had the dead girl any rings on when you saw her?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"Did you look to see?"\r\n\r\n"I think I did in the first shock of the discovery."\r\n\r\n"And you saw none?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"And from this you concluded she was not your wife?"\r\n\r\n"From this and other things."\r\n\r\n"Yet you must have seen that the woman was in the habit of wearing\r\nrings, even if they were not on her hands at that moment?"\r\n\r\n"Why, sir? What should I know about her habits?"\r\n\r\n"Is not that a ring I see now on your little finger?"\r\n\r\n"It is; my seal ring which I always wear."\r\n\r\n"Will you pull it off?"\r\n\r\n"Pull it off!"\r\n\r\n"If you please; it is a simple test I am requiring of you, sir."\r\n\r\nThe witness looked astonished, but pulled off the ring at once.\r\n\r\n"Here it is," said he.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, but I do not want it. I merely want you to look at your\r\nfinger."\r\n\r\nThe witness complied, evidently more nonplussed than disturbed by this\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\n"Do you see any difference between that finger and the one next it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; there is a mark about my little finger showing where the ring has\r\npressed."\r\n\r\n"Very good; there were such marks on the fingers of the dead girl, who,\r\nas you say, had no rings on. I saw them, and perhaps you did yourself?"\r\n\r\n"I did not; I did not look closely enough."\r\n\r\n"They were on the little finger of the right hand, on the marriage\r\nfinger of the left, and on the forefinger of the same. On which fingers\r\ndid your wife wear rings?"\r\n\r\n"On those same fingers, sir, but I will not accept this fact as proving\r\nher identity with the deceased. Most women do wear rings, and on those\r\nvery fingers."\r\n\r\nThe Coroner was nettled, but he was not discouraged. He exchanged looks\r\nwith Mr. Gryce, but nothing further passed between them and we were left\r\nto conjecture what this interchange of glances meant.\r\n\r\nThe witness, who did not seem to be affected either by the character of\r\nthis examination or by the conjectures to which it gave rise, preserved\r\nhis _sang-froid_, and eyed the Coroner as he might any other questioner,\r\nwith suitable respect, but with no fear and but little impatience. And\r\nyet he must have known the horrible suspicion darkening the minds of\r\nmany people present, and suspected, even if against his will, that this\r\nexamination, significant as it was, was but the forerunner of another\r\nand yet more serious one.\r\n\r\n"You are very determined," remarked the Coroner in beginning again, "not\r\nto accept the very substantial proofs presented you of the identity\r\nbetween the object of this inquiry and your missing wife. But we are not\r\nyet ready to give up the struggle, and so I must ask if you heard the\r\ndescription given by Miss Ferguson of the manner in which your wife was\r\ndressed on leaving Haddam?\r\n\r\n"I have."\r\n\r\n"Was it a correct account? Did she wear a black and white plaid silk and\r\na hat trimmed with various colored ribbons and flowers?"\r\n\r\n"She did."\r\n\r\n"Do you remember the hat? Were you with her when she bought it, or did\r\nyou ever have your attention drawn to it in any particular way?"\r\n\r\n"I remember the hat."\r\n\r\n"Is this it, Mr. Van Burnam?"\r\n\r\nI was watching Howard, and the start he gave was so pronounced and the\r\nemotion he displayed was in such violent contrast to the self-possession\r\nhe had maintained up to this point, that I was held spell-bound by the\r\nshock I received, and forebore to look at the object which the Coroner\r\nhad suddenly held up for inspection. But when I did turn my head towards\r\nit, I recognized at once the multi-colored hat which Mr. Gryce had\r\nbrought in from the third room of Mr. Van Burnam\'s house on the evening\r\nI was there, and realized almost in the same breath that great as this\r\nmystery had hitherto seemed it was likely to prove yet greater before\r\nits proper elucidation was arrived at.\r\n\r\n"Was that found in my father\'s house? Where--where was that hat found?"\r\nstammered the witness, so far forgetting himself as to point towards the\r\nobject in question.\r\n\r\n"It was found by Mr. Gryce in a closet off your father\'s dining-room, a\r\nshort time after the dead girl was carried out."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe it," vociferated the young man, paling with something\r\nmore than anger, and shaking from head to foot.\r\n\r\n"Shall I put Mr. Gryce on his oath again?" asked the Coroner, mildly.\r\n\r\nThe young man stared; evidently these words failed to reach his\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n"_Is_ it your wife\'s hat?" persisted the Coroner with very little\r\nmercy. "Do you recognize it for the one in which she left Haddam?"\r\n\r\n"Would to God I did not!" burst in vehement distress from the witness,\r\nwho at the next moment broke down altogether and looked about for the\r\nsupport of his brother\'s arm.\r\n\r\nFranklin came forward, and the two brothers stood for a moment in the\r\nface of the whole surging mass of curiosity-mongers before them, arm in\r\narm, but with very different expressions on their two proud faces.\r\nHoward was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n"If that was found in the parlors of my father\'s house," he cried, "then\r\nthe woman who was killed there was my wife." And he started away with a\r\nwild air towards the door.\r\n\r\n"Where are you going?" asked the Coroner, quietly, while an officer\r\nstepped softly before him, and his brother compassionately drew him back\r\nby the arm.\r\n\r\n"I am going to take her from that horrible place; she is my wife.\r\nFather, you would not wish her to remain in that spot for another\r\nmoment, would you, while we have a house we call our own?"\r\n\r\nMr. Van Burnam the senior, who had shrunk as far from sight as possible\r\nthrough these painful demonstrations, rose up at these words from his\r\nagonized son, and making him an encouraging gesture, walked hastily out\r\nof the room; seeing which, the young man became calmer, and though he\r\ndid not cease to shudder, tried to restrain his first grief, which to\r\nthose who looked closely at him was evidently very sincere.\r\n\r\n"I would not believe it was she," he cried, in total disregard of the\r\npresence he was in, "I _would not_ believe it; but now----" A certain\r\npitiful gesture finished the sentence, and neither Coroner nor jury\r\nseemed to know just how to proceed, the conduct of the young man being\r\nso markedly different from what they had expected. After a short pause,\r\npainful enough to all concerned, the Coroner, perceiving that very\r\nlittle could be done with the witness under the circumstances, adjourned\r\nthe sitting till afternoon.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Why could he not have said Miss Butterworth? These Van\r\nBurnams are proud, most vilely proud as the poet has it.--A. B.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nA SERIOUS ADMISSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nI went at once to a restaurant. I ate because it was time to eat, and\r\nbecause any occupation was welcome that would pass away the hours of\r\nwaiting. I was troubled; and I did not know what to make of myself. I\r\nwas no friend to the Van Burnams; I did not like them, and certainly had\r\nnever approved of any of them but Mr. Franklin, and yet I found myself\r\naltogether disturbed over the morning\'s developments, Howard\'s emotion\r\nhaving appealed to me in spite of my prejudices. I could not but think\r\nill of him, his conduct not being such as I could honestly commend. But\r\nI found myself more ready to listen to the involuntary pleadings of my\r\nown heart in his behalf than I had been prior to his testimony and its\r\nsomewhat startling termination.\r\n\r\nBut they were not through with him yet, and after the longest three\r\nhours I ever passed, we were again convened before the Coroner.\r\n\r\nI saw Howard as soon as anybody did. He came in, arm in arm as before,\r\nwith his faithful brother, and sat down in a retired corner behind the\r\nCoroner. But he was soon called forward.\r\n\r\nHis face when the light fell on it was startling to most of us. It was\r\nas much changed as if years, instead of hours, had elapsed since last\r\nwe saw it. No longer reckless in its expression, nor easy, nor politely\r\npatient, it showed in its every lineament that he had not only passed\r\nthrough a hurricane of passion, but that the bitterness, which had been\r\nits worst feature, had not passed with the storm, but had settled into\r\nthe core of his nature, disturbing its equilibrium forever. My emotions\r\nwere not allayed by the sight; but I kept all expression of them out of\r\nview. I must be sure of his integrity before giving rein to my\r\nsympathies.\r\n\r\nThe jury moved and sat up quite alert when they saw him. I think that if\r\nthese especial twelve men could have a murder case to investigate every\r\nday, they would grow quite wide-awake in time. Mr. Van Burnam made no\r\ndemonstration. Evidently there was not likely to be a repetition of the\r\nmorning\'s display of passion. He had been iron in his impassibility at\r\nthat time, but he was steel now, and steel which had been through the\r\nfiercest of fires.\r\n\r\nThe opening question of the Coroner showed by what experience these\r\nfires had been kindled.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Van Burnam, I have been told that you have visited the Morgue in\r\nthe interim which has elapsed since I last questioned you. Is that\r\ntrue?"\r\n\r\n"It is."\r\n\r\n"Did you, in the opportunity thus afforded, examine the remains of the\r\nwoman whose death we are investigating, attentively enough to enable you\r\nto say now whether they are those of your missing wife?"\r\n\r\n"I have. The body is that of Louise Van Burnam; I crave your pardon and\r\nthat of the jury for my former obstinacy in refusing to recognize it. I\r\nthought myself fully justified in the stand I took. I see now that I\r\nwas not."\r\n\r\nThe Coroner made no answer. There was no sympathy between him and this\r\nyoung man. Yet he did not fail in a decent show of respect; perhaps\r\nbecause he did feel some sympathy for the witness\'s unhappy father and\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n"You then acknowledge the victim to have been your wife?"\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"It is a point gained, and I compliment the jury upon it. We can now\r\nproceed to settle, if possible, the identity of the person who\r\naccompanied Mrs. Van Burnam into your father\'s house."\r\n\r\n"Wait," cried Mr. Van Burnam, with a strange air, "_I acknowledge I was\r\nthat person_."\r\n\r\nIt was coolly, almost fiercely said, but it was an admission that\r\nwellnigh created a hubbub. Even the Coroner seemed moved, and cast a\r\nglance at Mr. Gryce which showed his surprise to be greater than his\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\n"You acknowledge," he began--but the witness did not let him finish.\r\n\r\n"I acknowledge that I was the person who accompanied her into that empty\r\nhouse; but I do not acknowledge that I killed her. She was alive and\r\nwell when I left her, difficult as it is for me to prove it. It was the\r\nrealization of this difficulty which made me perjure myself this\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\n"So," murmured the Coroner, with another glance at Mr. Gryce, "you\r\nacknowledge that you perjured yourself. Will the room be quiet!"\r\n\r\nBut the lull came slowly. The contrast between the appearance of this\r\nelegant young man and the significant admissions he had just made\r\n(admissions which to three quarters of the persons there meant more,\r\nmuch more, than he acknowledged), was certainly such as to provoke\r\ninterest of the deepest kind. I felt like giving rein to my own\r\nfeelings, and was not surprised at the patience shown by the Coroner.\r\nBut order was restored at last, and the inquiry proceeded.\r\n\r\n"We are then to consider the testimony given by you this morning as null\r\nand void?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, so far as it contradicts what I have just stated."\r\n\r\n"Ah, then you will no doubt be willing to give us your evidence again?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly, if you will be so kind as to question me."\r\n\r\n"Very well; where did your wife and yourself first meet after your\r\narrival in New York?"\r\n\r\n"In the street near my office. She was coming to see me, but I prevailed\r\nupon her to go uptown."\r\n\r\n"What time was this?"\r\n\r\n"After ten and before noon. I cannot give the exact hour."\r\n\r\n"And where did you go?"\r\n\r\n"To a hotel on Broadway; you have already heard of our visit there."\r\n\r\n"You are, then, the Mr. James Pope, whose wife registered in the books\r\nof the Hotel D---- on the seventeenth of this month?"\r\n\r\n"I have said so."\r\n\r\n"And may I ask for what purpose you used this disguise, and allowed your\r\nwife to sign a wrong name?"\r\n\r\n"To satisfy a freak. She considered it the best way of covering up a\r\nscheme she had formed; which was to awaken the interest of my father\r\nunder the name and appearance of a stranger, and not to inform him who\r\nshe was till he had given some evidence of partiality for her."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but for such an end was it necessary for her to assume a strange\r\nname before she saw your father, and for you both to conduct yourselves\r\nin the mysterious way you did all that day and evening?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know. She thought so, and I humored her. I was tired of\r\nworking against her, and was willing she should have her own way for a\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"And for this reason you let her fit herself out with clothes down to\r\nher very undergarments?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; strange as it may seem, I was just such a fool. I had entered into\r\nher scheme, and the means she took to change her personality only amused\r\nme. She wished to present herself to my father as a girl obliged to work\r\nfor her living, and was too shrewd to excite suspicion in the minds of\r\nany of the family by any undue luxury in her apparel. At least that was\r\nthe excuse she gave me for the precautions she took, though I think the\r\ndelight she experienced in anything romantic and unusual had as much to\r\ndo with it as anything else. She enjoyed the game she was playing, and\r\nwished to make as much of it as possible."\r\n\r\n"Were her own garments much richer than those she ordered from\r\nAltman\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Undoubtedly. Mrs. Van Burnam wore nothing made by American\r\nseamstresses. Fine clothes were her weakness."\r\n\r\n"I see, I see; but why such an attempt on your part to keep yourself in\r\nthe background? Why let your wife write your assumed names in the hotel\r\nregister, for instance, instead of doing it yourself?"\r\n\r\n"It was easier for her; I know no other reason. She did not mind putting\r\ndown the name Pope. I did."\r\n\r\nIt was an ungracious reflection upon his wife, and he seemed to feel it\r\nso; for he almost immediately added: "A man will sometimes lend himself\r\nto a scheme of which the details are obnoxious. It was so in this case;\r\nbut she was too interested in her plans to be affected by so small a\r\nmatter as this."\r\n\r\nThis explained more than one mysterious action on the part of this pair\r\nwhile they were at the Hotel D----. The Coroner evidently considered it\r\nin this light, for he dwelt but little longer on this phase of the case,\r\npassing at once to a fact concerning which curiosity had hitherto been\r\nroused without receiving any satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"In leaving the hotel," said he, "you and your wife were seen carrying\r\ncertain packages, which were missing from your arms when you alighted at\r\nMr. Van Burnam\'s house. What was in those packages, and where did you\r\ndispose of them before you entered the second carriage?"\r\n\r\nHoward made no demur in answering.\r\n\r\n"My wife\'s clothes were in them," said he, "and we dropped them\r\nsomewhere on Twenty-seventh Street near Third Avenue, just as we saw an\r\nold woman coming along the sidewalk. We knew that she would stop and\r\npick them up, and she did, for we slid into a dark shadow made by a\r\nprojecting stoop and watched her. Is that too simple a method for\r\ndisposing of certain encumbering bundles, to be believed, sir?"\r\n\r\n"That is for the jury to decide," answered the Coroner, stiffly. "But\r\nwhy were you so anxious to dispose of these articles? Were they not\r\nworth some money, and would it not have been simpler and much more\r\nnatural to have left them at the hotel till you chose to send for them?\r\nThat is, if you were simply engaged in playing, as you say, a game upon\r\nyour father, and not upon the whole community?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," Mr. Van Burnam acknowledged, "that would have been the natural\r\nthing, no doubt; but we were not following natural instincts at the\r\ntime, but a woman\'s _bizarre_ caprices. We did as I said; and laughed\r\nlong, I assure you, over its unqualified success; for the old woman not\r\nonly grabbed the packages with avidity, but turned and fled away with\r\nthem, just as if she had expected this opportunity and had prepared\r\nherself to make the most of it."\r\n\r\n"It was very laughable, certainly," observed the Coroner, in a hard\r\nvoice. "_You_ must have found it very ridiculous"; and after giving the\r\nwitness a look full of something deeper than sarcasm, he turned towards\r\nthe jury as if to ask them what they thought of these very forced and\r\nsuspicious explanations.\r\n\r\nBut they evidently did not know what to think, and the Coroner\'s looks\r\nflew back to the witness who of all the persons present seemed the least\r\nimpressed by the position in which he stood.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Van Burnam," said he, "you showed a great deal of feeling this\r\nmorning at being confronted with your wife\'s hat. Why was this, and why\r\ndid you wait till you saw this evidence of her presence on the scene of\r\ndeath to acknowledge the facts you have been good enough to give us this\r\nafternoon?"\r\n\r\n"If I had a lawyer by my side, you would not ask me that question, or if\r\nyou did, I would not be allowed to answer it. But I have no lawyer here,\r\nand so I will say that I was greatly shocked by the catastrophe which\r\nhad happened to my wife, and under the stress of my first overpowering\r\nemotions had the impulse to hide the fact that the victim of so dreadful\r\na mischance was my wife. I thought that if no connection was found\r\nbetween myself and this dead woman, I would stand in no danger of the\r\nsuspicion which must cling to the man who came into the house with her.\r\nBut like most first impulses, it was a foolish one and gave way under\r\nthe strain of investigation. I, however, persisted in it as long as\r\npossible, partially because my disposition is an obstinate one, and\r\npartially because I hated to acknowledge myself a fool; but when I saw\r\nthe hat, and recognized it as an indisputable proof of her presence in\r\nthe Van Burnam house that night, my confidence in the attempt I was\r\nmaking broke down all at once. I could deny her shape, her hands, and\r\neven the scar, which she might have had in common with other women, but\r\nI could not deny her hat. Too many persons had seen her wear it."\r\n\r\nBut the Coroner was not to be so readily imposed upon.\r\n\r\n"I see, I see," he repeated with great dryness, "and I hope the jury\r\nwill be satisfied. And they probably will, unless they remember the\r\nanxiety which, according to your story, was displayed by your wife to\r\nhave her whole outfit in keeping with her appearance as a working girl.\r\nIf she was so particular as to think it necessary to dress herself in\r\nstore-made undergarments, why make all these precautions void by\r\ncarrying into the house a hat with the name of an expensive milliner\r\ninside it?"\r\n\r\n"Women are inconsistent, sir. She liked the hat and hated to part with\r\nit. She thought she could hide it somewhere in the great house, at least\r\nthat was what she said to me when she tucked it under her cape."\r\n\r\nThe Coroner, who evidently did not believe one word of this, stared at\r\nthe witness as if curiosity was fast taking the place of indignation.\r\nAnd I did not wonder. Howard Van Burnam, as thus presented to our notice\r\nby his own testimony, was an anomaly, whether we were to believe what he\r\nwas saying at the present time or what he had said during the morning\r\nsession. But I wished I had had the questioning of him.\r\n\r\nHis next answer, however, opened up one dark place into which I had been\r\npeering for some time without any enlightenment. It was in reply to the\r\nfollowing query:\r\n\r\n"All this," said the Coroner, "is very interesting; but what explanation\r\nhave you to give for taking your wife into your father\'s empty house at\r\nan hour so late, and then leaving her to spend the best part of the dark\r\nnight alone?"\r\n\r\n"None," said he, "that will strike you as sensible and judicious. But we\r\nwere not sensible that night, neither were we judicious, or I would not\r\nbe standing here trying to explain what is not explainable by any of the\r\nordinary rules of conduct. She was set upon being the first to greet my\r\nfather on his entrance into his own home, and her first plan had been to\r\ndo so in her own proper character as my wife, but afterwards the freak\r\ntook her, as I have said, to personify the housekeeper whom my father\r\nhad cabled us to have in waiting at his house,--a cablegram which had\r\nreached us too late for any practical use, and which we had therefore\r\nignored,--and fearing he might come early in the morning, before she\r\ncould be on hand to make the favorable impression she intended, she\r\nwished to be left in the house that night; and I humored her. I did not\r\nforesee the suffering that my departure might cause her, or the fears\r\nthat were likely to spring from her lonely position in so large and\r\nempty a dwelling. Or rather, I should say, _she_ did not foresee them;\r\nfor she begged me not to stay with her, when I hinted at the darkness\r\nand dreariness of the place, saying that she was too jolly to feel fear\r\nor think of anything but the surprise my father and sisters would\r\nexperience in discovering that their very agreeable young housekeeper\r\nwas the woman they had so long despised."\r\n\r\n"And why," persisted the Coroner, edging forward in his interest and so\r\nallowing me to catch a glimpse of Mr. Gryce\'s face as he too leaned\r\nforward in his anxiety to hear every word that fell from this remarkable\r\nwitness,--"why do you speak of her fear? What reason have you to think\r\nshe suffered apprehension after your departure?"\r\n\r\n"Why?" echoed the witness, as if astounded by the other\'s lack of\r\nperspicacity. "Did she not kill herself in a moment of terror and\r\ndiscouragement? Leaving her, as I did, in a condition of health and good\r\nspirits, can you expect me to attribute her death to any other cause\r\nthan a sudden attack of frenzy caused by terror?"\r\n\r\n"Ah!" exclaimed the Coroner in a suspicious tone, which no doubt voiced\r\nthe feelings of most people present; "then you think your wife committed\r\nsuicide?"\r\n\r\n"Most certainly," replied the witness, avoiding but two pairs of eyes in\r\nthe whole crowd, those of his father and brother.\r\n\r\n"_With_ a hat-pin," continued the Coroner, letting his hitherto scarcely\r\nsuppressed irony become fully visible in voice and manner, "thrust into\r\nthe back of her neck at a spot young ladies surely would have but little\r\nreason to know is peculiarly fatal! Suicide! when she was found crushed\r\nunder a pile of _bric-\xe0-brac_, which was thrown down or fell upon her\r\nhours after she received the fatal thrust!"\r\n\r\n"I do not know how else she could have died," persisted the witness,\r\ncalmly, "unless she opened the door to some burglar. And what burglar\r\nwould kill a woman in that way, when he could pound her with his fists?\r\nNo; she was frenzied and stabbed herself in desperation; or the thing\r\nwas done by accident, God knows how! And as for the testimony of the\r\nexperts--we all know how easily the wisest of them can be mistaken even\r\nin matters of as serious import as these. _If all the experts in the\r\nworld_"--here his voice rose and his nostrils dilated till his aspect\r\nwas actually commanding and impressed us all like a sudden\r\ntransformation--"_If all the experts in the world were to swear that\r\nthose shelves were thrown upon her after she had lain therefor four\r\nhours dead, I would not believe them. Appearances or no appearances,\r\nblood or no blood, I here declare that she pulled that cabinet over in\r\nher death-struggle; and upon the truth of this fact I am ready to rest\r\nmy honor as a man and my integrity as her husband_."\r\n\r\nAn uproar immediately followed, amid which could be heard cries of "He\r\nlies!" "He\'s a fool!" The attitude taken by the witness was so\r\nunexpected that the most callous person present could not fail to be\r\naffected by it. But curiosity is as potent a passion as surprise, and in\r\na few minutes all was still again and everybody intent to hear how the\r\nCoroner would answer these asseverations.\r\n\r\n"I have heard of a blind man denying the existence of light," said that\r\ngentleman, "but never before of a sensible being like yourself urging\r\nthe most untenable theories in face of such evidence as has been brought\r\nbefore us during this inquiry. If your wife committed suicide, or if the\r\nentrance of the point of a hat-pin into her spine was effected by\r\naccident, how comes the head of the pin to have been found so many feet\r\naway from her and in such a place as the parlor register?"\r\n\r\n"It may have flown there when it broke, or, what is much more probable,\r\nbeen kicked there by some of the many people who passed in and out of\r\nthe room between the time of her death and that of its discovery."\r\n\r\n"But the register was found closed," urged the Coroner. "Was it not, Mr.\r\nGryce?"\r\n\r\nThat person thus appealed to, rose for an instant.\r\n\r\n"It was," said he, and deliberately sat down again.\r\n\r\nThe face of the witness, which had been singularly free from expression\r\nsince his last vehement outbreak, clouded over for an instant and his\r\neye fell as if he felt himself engaged in an unequal struggle. But he\r\nrecovered his courage speedily, and quietly observed:\r\n\r\n"The register may have been closed by a passing foot. I have known of\r\nstranger coincidences than that."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Van Burnam," asked the Coroner, as if weary of subterfuges and\r\nargument, "have you considered the effect which this highly\r\ncontradictory evidence of yours is likely to have on your reputation?"\r\n\r\n"I have."\r\n\r\n"And are you ready to accept the consequences?"\r\n\r\n"If any especial consequences follow, I must accept them, sir."\r\n\r\n"When did you lose the keys which you say you have not now in your\r\npossession? This morning you asserted that you did not know; but perhaps\r\nthis afternoon you may like to modify that statement."\r\n\r\n"I lost them after I left my wife shut up in my father\'s house."\r\n\r\n"Soon?"\r\n\r\n"Very soon."\r\n\r\n"How soon?"\r\n\r\n"Within an hour, I should judge."\r\n\r\n"How do you know it was so soon?"\r\n\r\n"I missed them at once."\r\n\r\n"Where were you when you missed them?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; somewhere. I was walking the streets, as I have said. I\r\ndon\'t remember just where I was when I thrust my hands into my pocket\r\nand found the keys gone."\r\n\r\n"You do not?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"But it was within an hour after leaving the house?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Very good; the keys have been found."\r\n\r\nThe witness started, started so violently that his teeth came together\r\nwith a click loud enough to be heard over the whole room.\r\n\r\n"Have they?" said he, with an effort at nonchalance which, however,\r\nfailed to deceive any one who noticed his change of color. "_You_ can\r\ntell me, then, where I lost them."\r\n\r\n"They were found," said the Coroner, "in their usual place above your\r\nbrother\'s desk in Duane Street."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" murmured the witness, utterly taken aback or appearing so. "I\r\ncannot account for their being found in the office. I was so sure I\r\ndropped them in the street."\r\n\r\n"I did not think you could account for it," quietly observed the\r\nCoroner. And without another word he dismissed the witness, who\r\nstaggered to a seat as remote as possible from the one where he had\r\npreviously been sitting between his father and brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\nA RELUCTANT WITNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA pause of decided duration now followed; an exasperating pause which\r\ntried even me, much as I pride myself upon my patience. There seemed to\r\nbe some hitch in regard to the next witness. The Coroner sent Mr. Gryce\r\ninto the neighboring room more than once, and finally, when the general\r\nuneasiness seemed on the point of expressing itself by a loud murmur, a\r\ngentleman stepped forth, whose appearance, instead of allaying the\r\nexcitement, renewed it in quite an unprecedented and remarkable way.\r\n\r\nI did not know the person thus introduced.\r\n\r\nHe was a handsome man, a very handsome man, if the truth must be told,\r\nbut it did not seem to be this fact which made half the people there\r\ncrane their heads to catch a glimpse of him. Something else, something\r\nentirely disconnected with his appearance there as a witness, appeared\r\nto hold the people enthralled and waken a subdued enthusiasm which\r\nshowed itself not only in smiles, but in whispers and significant\r\nnudges, chiefly among the women, though I noticed that the jurymen\r\nstared when somebody obliged them with the name of this new witness. At\r\nlast it reached my ears, and though it awakened in me also a decided\r\ncuriosity, I restrained all expression of it, being unwilling to add\r\none jot to this ridiculous display of human weakness.\r\n\r\nRandolph Stone, as the intended husband of the rich Miss Althorpe, was a\r\nfigure of some importance in the city, and while I was very glad of this\r\nopportunity of seeing him, I did not propose to lose my head or forget,\r\nin the marked interest his person invoked, the very serious cause which\r\nhad brought him before us. And yet I suppose no one in the room observed\r\nhis figure more minutely.\r\n\r\nHe was elegantly made and possessed, as I have said, a face of peculiar\r\nbeauty. But these were not his only claims to admiration. He was a man\r\nof undoubted intelligence and great distinction of manner. The\r\nintelligence did not surprise me, knowing, as I did, how he had raised\r\nhimself to his present enviable position in society in the short space\r\nof five years. But the perfection of his manner astonished me, though\r\nhow I could have expected anything less in a man honored by Miss\r\nAlthorpe\'s regard, I cannot say. He had that clear pallor of complexion\r\nwhich in a smooth-shaven face is so impressive, and his voice when he\r\nspoke had that music in it which only comes from great cultivation and a\r\ndeliberate intent to please.\r\n\r\nHe was a friend of Howard\'s, that I saw by the short look that passed\r\nbetween them when he first entered the room; but that it was not as a\r\nfriend he stood there was apparent from the state of amazement with\r\nwhich the former recognized him, as well as from the regret to be seen\r\nunderlying the polished manner of the witness himself. Though perfectly\r\nself-possessed and perfectly respectful, he showed by every means\r\npossible the pain he felt in adding one feather-weight to the evidence\r\nagainst a man with whom he was on terms of more or less intimacy.\r\n\r\nBut let me give his testimony. Having acknowledged that he knew the Van\r\nBurnam family well, and Howard in particular, he went on to state that\r\non the night of the seventeenth he had been detained at his office by\r\nbusiness of a more than usual pressing nature, and finding that he could\r\nexpect no rest for that night, humored himself by getting off the cars\r\nat Twenty-first Street instead of proceeding on to Thirty-third Street,\r\nwhere his apartments were.\r\n\r\nThe smile which these words caused (Miss Althorpe lives in Twenty-first\r\nStreet) woke no corresponding light on his face. Indeed, he frowned at\r\nit, as if he felt that the gravity of the situation admitted of nothing\r\nfrivolous or humorsome. And this feeling was shared by Howard, for he\r\nstarted when the witness mentioned Twenty-first Street, and cast him a\r\nhaggard look of dismay which happily no one saw but myself, for every\r\none else was concerned with the witness. Or should I except Mr. Gryce?\r\n\r\n"I had of course no intentions beyond a short stroll through this street\r\nprevious to returning to my home," continued the witness, gravely; "and\r\nam sorry to be obliged to mention this freak of mine, but find it\r\nnecessary in order to account for my presence there at so unusual an\r\nhour."\r\n\r\n"You need make no apologies," returned the Coroner. "Will you state on\r\nwhat line of cars you came from your office?"\r\n\r\n"I came up Third Avenue."\r\n\r\n"Ah! and walked towards Broadway?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"So that you necessarily passed very near the Van Burnam mansion?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"At what time was this, can you say?"\r\n\r\n"At four, or nearly four. It was half-past three when I left my office."\r\n\r\n"Was it light at that hour? Could you distinguish objects readily?"\r\n\r\n"I had no difficulty in seeing."\r\n\r\n"And what did you see? Anything amiss at the Van Burnam mansion?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir, nothing amiss. I merely saw Howard Van Burnam coming down the\r\nstoop as I went by the corner."\r\n\r\n"You made no mistake. It was the gentleman you name, and no other whom\r\nyou saw on this stoop at this hour?"\r\n\r\n"I am very sure that it was he. I am sorry----"\r\n\r\nBut the Coroner gave him no opportunity to finish.\r\n\r\n"You and Mr. Van Burnam are friends, you say, and it was light enough\r\nfor you to recognize each other; then you probably spoke?"\r\n\r\n"No, we did not. I was thinking--well of other, things," and here he\r\nallowed the ghost of a smile to flit suggestively across his firm-set\r\nlips. "And Mr. Van Burnam seemed preoccupied also, for, as far as I\r\nknow, he did not even look my way."\r\n\r\n"And you did not stop?"\r\n\r\n"No, he did not look like a man to be disturbed."\r\n\r\n"And this was at four on the morning of the eighteenth?"\r\n\r\n"At four."\r\n\r\n"You are certain of the hour and of the day?"\r\n\r\n"I am certain. I should not be standing here if I were not very sure of\r\nmy memory. I am sorry," he began again, but he was stopped as\r\nperemptorily as before by the Coroner.\r\n\r\n"Feeling has no place in an inquiry like this." And the witness was\r\ndismissed.\r\n\r\nMr. Stone, who had manifestly given his evidence under compulsion,\r\nlooked relieved at its termination. As he passed back to the room from\r\nwhich he had come, many only noticed the extreme elegance of his form\r\nand the proud cast of his head, but I saw more than these. I saw the\r\nlook of regret he cast at his friend Howard.\r\n\r\nA painful silence followed his withdrawal, then the Coroner spoke to the\r\njury:\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, I leave you to judge of the importance of this testimony.\r\nMr. Stone is a well-known man of unquestionable integrity, but perhaps\r\nMr. Van Burnam can explain how he came to visit his father\'s house at\r\nfour o\'clock in the morning on that memorable night, when according to\r\nhis latest testimony he left his wife there at twelve. We will give him\r\nthe opportunity."\r\n\r\n"There is no use," began the young man from the place where he sat. But\r\ngathering courage even while speaking, he came rapidly forward, and\r\nfacing Coroner and jury once more, said with a false kind of energy that\r\nimposed upon no one:\r\n\r\n"I can explain this fact, but I doubt if you will accept my explanation.\r\nI was at my father\'s house at that hour, but not in it. My restlessness\r\ndrove me back to my wife, but not finding the keys in my pocket, I came\r\ndown the stoop again and went away."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I see now why you prevaricated this morning in regard to the time\r\nwhen you missed those keys."\r\n\r\n"I know that my testimony is full of contradictions."\r\n\r\n"You feared to have it known that you were on the stoop of your father\'s\r\nhouse for the second time that night?"\r\n\r\n"Naturally, in face of the suspicion I perceived everywhere about me."\r\n\r\n"And this time you did not go in?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Nor ring the bell?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Why not, if you left your wife within, alive and well?"\r\n\r\n"I did not wish to disturb her. My purpose was not strong enough to\r\nsurmount the least difficulty. I was easily deterred from going where I\r\nhad little wish to be."\r\n\r\n"So that you merely went up the stoop and down again at the time Mr.\r\nStone saw you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and if he had passed a minute sooner he would have seen this: seen\r\nme go up, I mean, as well as seen me come down. I did not linger long in\r\nthe doorway."\r\n\r\n"But you did linger there a moment?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; long enough to hunt for the keys and get over my astonishment at\r\nnot finding them."\r\n\r\n"Did you notice Mr. Stone going by on Twenty-first Street?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Was it as light as Mr. Stone has said?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was light."\r\n\r\n"And you did not notice him?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Yet you must have followed very closely behind him?"\r\n\r\n"Not necessarily. I went by the way of Twentieth Street, sir. Why, I do\r\nnot know, for my rooms are uptown. I do not know why I did half the\r\nthings I did that night."\r\n\r\n"I can readily believe it," remarked the Coroner.\r\n\r\nMr. Van Burnam\'s indignation rose.\r\n\r\n"You are trying," said he, "to connect me with the fearful death of my\r\nwife in my father\'s lonely house. You cannot do it, for I am as innocent\r\nof that death as you are, or any other person in this assemblage. Nor\r\ndid I pull those shelves down upon her as you would have this jury\r\nthink, in my last thoughtless visit to my father\'s door. She died\r\naccording to God\'s will by her own hand or by means of some strange and\r\nunaccountable accident known only to Him. And so you will find, if\r\njustice has any place in these investigations and a manly intelligence\r\nbe allowed to take the place of prejudice in the breasts of the twelve\r\nmen now sitting before me."\r\n\r\nAnd bowing to the Coroner, he waited for his dismissal, and receiving\r\nit, walked back not to his lonely corner, but to his former place\r\nbetween his father and brother, who received him with a wistful air and\r\nstrange looks of mingled hope and disbelief.\r\n\r\n"The jury will render their verdict on Monday morning," announced the\r\nCoroner, and adjourned the inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOOK II._\r\n\r\nTHE WINDINGS OF A LABYRINTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\nCOGITATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy cook had prepared for me a most excellent dinner, thinking that I\r\nneeded all the comfort possible after a day of such trying experiences.\r\nBut I ate little of it; my thoughts were too busy, my mind too much\r\nexercised. What would be the verdict of the jury, and could this\r\nespecial jury be relied upon to give a just verdict?\r\n\r\nAt seven I had left the table and was shut up in my own room. I could\r\nnot rest till I had fathomed my own mind in regard to the events of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe question--the great question, of course, now--was how much of\r\nHoward\'s testimony was to be believed, and whether he was,\r\nnotwithstanding his asseverations to the contrary, the murderer of his\r\nwife. To most persons the answer seemed easy. From the expression of\r\nsuch people as I had jostled in leaving the court-room, I judged that\r\nhis sentence had already been passed in the minds of most there present.\r\nBut these hasty judgments did not influence me. I hope I look deeper\r\nthan the surface, and my mind would not subscribe to his guilt,\r\nnotwithstanding the bad impression made upon me by his falsehoods and\r\ncontradictions.\r\n\r\nNow why would not my mind subscribe to it? Had sentiment got the better\r\nof me, Amelia Butterworth, and was I no longer capable of looking a\r\nthing squarely in the face? Had the Van Burnams, of all people in the\r\nworld, awakened my sympathies at the cost of my good sense, and was I\r\ndisposed to see virtue in a man in whom every circumstance as it came to\r\nlight revealed little but folly and weakness? The lies he had told--for\r\nthere is no other word to describe his contradictions--would have been\r\nsufficient under most circumstances to condemn a man in my estimation.\r\nWhy, then, did I secretly look for excuses to his conduct?\r\n\r\nProbing the matter to the bottom, I reasoned in this way: The latter\r\nhalf of his evidence was a complete contradiction of the first,\r\npurposely so. In the first, he made himself out a cold-hearted egotist\r\nwith not enough interest in his wife to make an effort to determine\r\nwhether she and the murdered woman were identical; in the latter, he\r\nshowed himself in the light of a man influenced to the point of folly by\r\na woman to whom he had been utterly unyielding a few hours before.\r\n\r\nNow, knowing human nature to be full of contradictions, I could not\r\nsatisfy myself that I should be justified in accepting either half of\r\nhis testimony as absolutely true. The man who is all firmness one minute\r\nmay be all weakness the next, and in face of the calm assertions made by\r\nthis one when driven to bay by the unexpected discoveries of the police,\r\nI dared not decide that his final assurances were altogether false, and\r\nthat he was not the man I had seen enter the adjoining house with his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, not carry the conclusion farther and admit, as reason and\r\nprobability suggested, that he was also her murderer; that he had killed\r\nher during his first visit and drawn the shelves down upon her in the\r\nsecond? Would not this account for all the phenomena to be observed in\r\nconnection with this otherwise unexplainable affair? Certainly, all but\r\none--one that was perhaps known to nobody but myself, and that was the\r\ntestimony given by the clock. _It_ said that the shelves fell at five,\r\nwhereas, according to Mr. Stone\'s evidence, it was four, or thereabouts,\r\nwhen Mr. Van Burnam left his father\'s house. But the clock might not\r\nhave been a reliable witness. It might have been set wrong, or it might\r\nnot have been running at all at the time of the accident. No, it would\r\nnot do for me to rely too much upon anything so doubtful, nor did I; yet\r\nI could not rid myself of the conviction that Howard spoke the truth\r\nwhen he declared in face of Coroner and jury that they could not connect\r\nhim with this crime; and whether this conclusion sprang from\r\nsentimentality or intuition, I was resolved to stick to it for the\r\npresent night at least. The morrow might show its futility, but the\r\nmorrow had not come.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, with this theory accepted, what explanation could be given of\r\nthe very peculiar facts surrounding this woman\'s death? Could the\r\nsupposition of suicide advanced by Howard before the Coroner be\r\nentertained for a moment, or that equally improbable suggestion of\r\naccident?\r\n\r\nGoing to my bureau drawer, I drew out the old grocer-bill which has\r\nalready figured in these pages, and re-read the notes I had scribbled\r\non its back early in the history of this affair. They related, if you\r\nwill remember, to this very question, and seemed even now to answer it\r\nin a more or less convincing way. Will you pardon me if I transcribe\r\nthese notes again, as I cannot imagine my first deliberations on this\r\nsubject to have made a deep enough impression for you to recall them\r\nwithout help from me.\r\n\r\nThe question raised in these notes was threefold, and the answers, as\r\nyou will recollect, were transcribed before the cause of death had been\r\ndetermined by the discovery of the broken pin in the dead woman\'s brain.\r\n\r\nThese are the queries:\r\n\r\nFirst: was her death due to accident?\r\n\r\nSecond: was it effected by her own hand?\r\n\r\nThird: was it a murder?\r\n\r\nThe replies given are in the form of reasons, as witness:\r\n\r\n_My reasons for not thinking it an accident._\r\n\r\n1. If it had been an accident, and she had pulled the cabinet over upon\r\nherself,[B] she would have been found with her feet pointing towards the\r\nwall where the cabinet had stood. But her feet were towards the door and\r\nher head under the cabinet.\r\n\r\n2. The precise arrangement of the clothing about her feet, which\r\nprecluded any theory involving accident.\r\n\r\n_My reason for not thinking it a suicide._\r\n\r\nShe could not have been found in the position observed without having\r\nlain down on the floor while living, and then pulled the shelves down\r\nupon herself. (A theory obviously too improbable to be considered.)\r\n\r\n_My reason for not thinking it murder._\r\n\r\nShe would need to have been held down on the floor while the cabinet was\r\nbeing pulled over on her, a thing which the quiet aspect of the hands\r\nand feet make appear impossible. (Very good, but we know now that she\r\nwas dead when the shelves fell over, so that my one excuse for not\r\nthinking it a murder is rendered null.)\r\n\r\n_My reasons for thinking it a murder._\r\n\r\n----But I will not repeat these. My reasons for not thinking it an\r\naccident or a suicide remained as good as when they were written, and if\r\nher death had not been due to either of these causes, then it must have\r\nbeen due to some murderous hand. Was that hand the hand of her husband?\r\nI have already given it as my opinion that it was not.\r\n\r\nNow, how to make that opinion good, and reconcile me again to myself;\r\nfor I am not accustomed to have my instincts at war with my judgment. Is\r\nthere any reason for my thinking as I do? Yes, the manliness of man. He\r\nonly looked well when he was repelling the suspicion he saw in the\r\nsurrounding faces. But that might have been assumed, just as his\r\ncareless manner was assumed during the early part of the inquiry. I must\r\nhave some stronger reason than this for my belief. The two hats? Well,\r\nhe had explained how there came to be two hats on the scene of crime,\r\nbut his explanation had not been very satisfactory. _I_ had seen no hat\r\nin her hand when she crossed the pavement to her father\'s house. But\r\nthen she might have carried it under her cape without my seeing\r\nit--perhaps. The discovery of two hats and of two pairs of gloves in Mr.\r\nVan Burnam\'s parlors was a fact worth further investigation, and\r\nmentally I made a note of it, though at the moment I saw no prospect of\r\nengaging in this matter further than my duties as a witness required.\r\n\r\nAnd now what other clue was offered me, save the one I have already\r\nmentioned as being given by the clock? None that I could seize upon; and\r\nfeeling the weakness of the cause I had so obstinately embraced, I rose\r\nfrom my seat at the tea-table and began making such alterations in my\r\ntoilet as would prepare me for the evening and my inevitable callers.\r\n\r\n"Amelia," said I to myself, as I encountered my anything but satisfied\r\nreflection in the glass, "can it be that you ought, after all, to have\r\nbeen called Araminta? Is a momentary display of spirit on the part of a\r\nyoung man of doubtful principles, enough to make you forget the dictates\r\nof good sense which have always governed you up to this time?"\r\n\r\nThe stern image which confronted me from the mirror made me no reply,\r\nand smitten with sudden disgust, I left the glass and went below to\r\ngreet some friends who had just ridden up in their carriage.\r\n\r\nThey remained one hour, and they discussed one subject: Howard Van\r\nBurnam and his probable connection with the crime which had taken place\r\nnext door. But though I talked some and listened more, as is proper for\r\na woman in her own house, I said nothing and heard nothing which had not\r\nbeen already said and heard in numberless homes that night. Whatever\r\nthoughts I had which in any way differed from those generally expressed,\r\nI kept to myself,--whether guided by discretion or pride, I cannot say;\r\nprobably by both, for I am not deficient in either quality.\r\n\r\nArrangements had already been made for the burial of Mrs. Van Burnam\r\nthat night, and as the funeral ceremony was to take place next door,\r\nmany of my guests came just to sit in my windows and watch the coming\r\nand going of the few people invited to the ceremony.\r\n\r\nBut I discouraged this. I have no patience with idle curiosity.\r\nConsequently by nine I was left alone to give the affair such real\r\nattention as it demanded; something which, of course, I could not have\r\ndone with a half dozen gossiping friends leaning over my shoulder.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: _As was asserted by her husband in his sworn examination._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\nBUTTERWORTH VERSUS GRYCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result of this attention can be best learned from the conversation I\r\nheld with Mr. Gryce the next morning.\r\n\r\nHe came earlier than usual, but he found me up and stirring.\r\n\r\n"Well," he cried, accosting me with a smile as I entered the parlor\r\nwhere he was seated, "it is all right this time, is it not? No trouble\r\nin identifying the gentleman who entered your neighbor\'s house last\r\nnight at a quarter to twelve?"\r\n\r\nResolved to probe this man\'s mind to the bottom, I put on my sternest\r\nair.\r\n\r\n"I had not expected any one to enter there so late last night," said I.\r\n"Mr. Van Burnam declared so positively at the inquest that he was the\r\nperson we have been endeavoring to identify, that I did not suppose you\r\nwould consider it necessary to bring him to the house for me to see."\r\n\r\n"And so you were not in the window?"\r\n\r\n"I did not say that; I am always where I have promised to be, Mr.\r\nGryce."\r\n\r\n"Well, then?" he inquired sharply.\r\n\r\nI was purposely slow in answering him--I had all the longer time to\r\nsearch his face. But its calmness was impenetrable, and finally I\r\ndeclared:\r\n\r\n"The man you brought with you last night--you were the person who\r\naccompanied him, were you not--was _not_ the man I saw alight there four\r\nnights ago."\r\n\r\nHe may have expected it; it may have been the very assertion he desired\r\nfrom me, but his manner showed displeasure, and the quick "How?" he\r\nuttered was sharp and peremptory.\r\n\r\n"I do not ask who it was," I went on, with a quiet wave of my hand that\r\nimmediately restored him to himself, "for I know you will not tell me.\r\nBut what I do hope to know is the name of the man who entered that same\r\nhouse at just ten minutes after nine. He was one of the funeral guests,\r\nand he arrived in a carriage that was immediately preceded by a coach\r\nfrom which four persons alighted, two ladies and two gentlemen."\r\n\r\n"I do not know the gentleman, ma\'am," was the detective\'s half-surprised\r\nand half-amused retort. "I did not keep track of every guest that\r\nattended the funeral."\r\n\r\n"Then you didn\'t do your work as well as I did mine," was my rather dry\r\nreply. "For I noted every one who went in; and that gentleman, whoever\r\nhe was, was more like the person I have been trying to identify than any\r\none I have seen enter there during my four midnight vigils."\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce smiled, uttered a short "_Indeed!_" and looked more than ever\r\nlike a sphinx. I began quietly to hate him, under my calm exterior.\r\n\r\n"Was Howard at his wife\'s funeral?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"He was, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"And did he come in a carriage?"\r\n\r\n"He did, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Alone?"\r\n\r\n"He thought he was alone; yes, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Then may it not have been he?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say, ma\'am."\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce was so obviously out of his element under this\r\ncross-examination that I could not suppress a smile even while I\r\nexperienced a very lively indignation at his reticence. He may have seen\r\nme smile and he may not, for his eyes, as I have intimated, were always\r\nbusy with some object entirely removed from the person he addressed; but\r\nat all events he rose, leaving me no alternative but to do the same.\r\n\r\n"And so you didn\'t recognize the gentleman I brought to the neighboring\r\nhouse just before twelve o\'clock," he quietly remarked, with a calm\r\nignoring of my last question which was a trifle exasperating.\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Then, ma\'am," he declared, with a quick change of manner, meant, I\r\nshould judge, to put me in my proper place, "I do not think we can\r\ndepend upon the accuracy of your memory;" and he made a motion as if to\r\nleave.\r\n\r\nAs I did not know whether his apparent disappointment was real or not, I\r\nlet him move to the door without a reply. But once there I stopped him.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Gryce," said I, "I don\'t know what you think about this matter, nor\r\nwhether you even wish my opinion upon it. But I am going to express it,\r\nfor all that. _I_ do not believe that Howard killed his wife with a\r\nhat-pin."\r\n\r\n"No?" retorted the old gentleman, peering into his hat, with an ironical\r\nsmile which that inoffensive article of attire had certainly not\r\nmerited. "And why, Miss Butterworth, why? You must have substantial\r\nreasons for any opinion you would form."\r\n\r\n"I have an intuition," I responded, "backed by certain reasons. The\r\nintuition won\'t impress you very deeply, but the reasons may not be\r\nwithout some weight, and I am going to confide them to you."\r\n\r\n"Do," he entreated in a jocose manner which struck me as inappropriate,\r\nbut which I was willing to overlook on account of his age and very\r\nfatherly manner.\r\n\r\n"Well, then," said I, "this is one. If the crime was a premeditated one,\r\nif he hated his wife and felt it for his interest to have her out of the\r\nway, a man of Mr. Van Burnam\'s good sense would have chosen any other\r\nspot than his father\'s house to kill her in, knowing that her identity\r\ncould not be hidden if once she was associated with the Van Burnam name.\r\nIf, on the contrary, he took her there in good faith, and her death was\r\nthe unexpected result of a quarrel between them, then the means employed\r\nwould have been simpler. An angry man does not stop to perform a\r\ndelicate surgical operation when moved to the point of murder, but uses\r\nhis hands or his fists, just as Mr. Van Burnam himself suggested."\r\n\r\n"Humph!" grunted the detective, staring very hard indeed into his hat.\r\n\r\n"You must not think me this young man\'s friend," I went on, with a well\r\nmeant desire to impress him with the impartiality of my attitude. "I\r\nnever have spoken to him nor he to me, but I am the friend of justice,\r\nand I must declare that there was a note of surprise in the emotion he\r\nshowed at sight of his wife\'s hat, that was far too natural to be\r\nassumed."\r\n\r\nThe detective failed to be impressed. I might have expected this,\r\nknowing his sex and the reliance such a man is apt to place upon his own\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n"Acting, ma\'am, acting!" was his laconic comment. "A very uncommon\r\ncharacter, that of Mr. Howard Van Burnam. I do not think you do it full\r\njustice."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not, but see that you don\'t slight mine. I do not expect you to\r\nheed these suggestions any more than you did those I offered you in\r\nconnection with Mrs. Boppert, the scrub-woman; but my conscience is\r\neased by my communication, and that is much to a solitary woman like\r\nmyself who is obliged to spend many a long hour alone with no other\r\ncompanion."\r\n\r\n"Something has been accomplished, then, by this delay," he observed.\r\nThen, as if ashamed of this momentary display of irritation, he added in\r\nthe genial tones more natural to him: "I don\'t blame you for your good\r\nopinion of this interesting, but by no means reliable, young man, Miss\r\nButterworth. A woman\'s kind heart stands in the way of her proper\r\njudgment of criminals."\r\n\r\n"You will not find its instincts fail even if you do its judgment."\r\n\r\nHis bow was as full of politeness as it was lacking in conviction.\r\n\r\n"I hope you won\'t let your instincts lead you into any unnecessary\r\ndetective work," he quietly suggested.\r\n\r\n"That I cannot promise. If you arrest Howard Van Burnam for murder, I\r\nmay be tempted to meddle with matters which don\'t concern me."\r\n\r\nAn amused smile broke through his simulated seriousness.\r\n\r\n"Pray accept my congratulations, then, in advance, ma\'am. My health has\r\nbeen such that I have long anticipated giving up my profession; but if I\r\nam to have such assistants as you in my work, I shall be inclined to\r\nremain in it some time longer."\r\n\r\n"When a man as busy as you stops to indulge in sarcasm, he is in more or\r\nless good spirits. Such a condition, I am told, only prevails with\r\ndetectives when they have come to a positive conclusion concerning the\r\ncase they are engaged upon."\r\n\r\n"I see you already understand the members of your future profession."\r\n\r\n"As much as is necessary at this juncture," I retorted. Then seeing him\r\nabout to repeat his bow, I added sharply: "You need not trouble yourself\r\nto show me too much politeness. If I meddle in this matter at all it\r\nwill not be as your coadjutor, but as your rival."\r\n\r\n"My rival?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, your rival; and rivals are never good friends until one of them is\r\nhopelessly defeated."\r\n\r\n"Miss Butterworth, I see myself already at your feet."\r\n\r\nAnd with this sally and a short chuckle which did more than anything he\r\nhad said towards settling me in my half-formed determination to do as I\r\nhad threatened, he opened the door and quietly disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE PINCUSHION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe verdict rendered by the Coroner\'s jury showed it to be a more\r\ndiscriminating set of men than I had calculated upon. It was murder\r\ninflicted by a hand unknown.\r\n\r\nI was so gratified by this that I left the court-room in quite an\r\nagitated frame of mind, so agitated, indeed, that I walked through one\r\ndoor instead of another, and thus came unexpectedly upon a group formed\r\nalmost exclusively of the Van Burnam family.\r\n\r\nStarting back, for I dislike anything that looks like intrusion,\r\nespecially when no great end is to be gained by it, I was about to\r\nretrace my steps when I felt two soft arms about my neck.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Miss Butterworth, isn\'t it a mercy that this dreadful thing is\r\nover! I don\'t know when I have ever felt anything so keenly."\r\n\r\nIt was Isabella Van Burnam.\r\n\r\nStartled, for the embraces bestowed on me are few, I gave a subdued sort\r\nof grunt, which nevertheless did not displease this young lady, for her\r\narms tightened, and she murmured in my ear: "You dear old soul! I like\r\nyou _so_ much."\r\n\r\n"We are going to be very good neighbors," cooed a still sweeter voice in\r\nmy other ear. "Papa says we must call on you soon." And Caroline\'s\r\ndemure face looked around into mine in a manner some would have thought\r\nexceedingly bewitching.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, pretty poppets!" I returned, freeing myself as speedily as\r\npossible from embraces the sincerity of which I felt open to question.\r\n"My house is always open to you." And with little ceremony, I walked\r\nsteadily out and betook myself to the carriage awaiting me.\r\n\r\nI looked upon this display of feeling as the mere gush of two\r\nover-excited young women, and was therefore somewhat astonished when I\r\nwas interrupted in my afternoon nap by an announcement that the two\r\nMisses Van Burnam awaited me in the parlor.\r\n\r\nGoing down, I saw them standing there hand in hand and both as white as\r\na sheet.\r\n\r\n"O Miss Butterworth!" they cried, springing towards me, "Howard has been\r\narrested, and we have no one to say a word of comfort to us."\r\n\r\n"Arrested!" I repeated, greatly surprised, for I had not expected it to\r\nhappen so soon, if it happened at all.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and father is just about prostrated. Franklin, too, but he keeps\r\nup, while father has shut himself into his room and won\'t see anybody,\r\nnot even us. O, I don\'t know how we are to bear it! Such a disgrace, and\r\nsuch a wicked, wicked shame! For Howard never had anything to do with\r\nhis wife\'s death, had he, Miss Butterworth?"\r\n\r\n"No," I returned, taking my ground at once, and vigorously, for I really\r\nbelieved what I said. "He is innocent of her death, and I would like the\r\nchance of proving it."\r\n\r\nThey evidently had not expected such an unqualified assertion from me,\r\nfor they almost smothered me with kisses, and called me _their only\r\nfriend_! and indeed showed so much real feeling this time that I neither\r\npushed them away nor tried to withdraw myself from their embraces.\r\n\r\nWhen their emotions were a little exhausted I led them to a sofa and sat\r\ndown before them. They were motherless girls, and my heart, if hard, is\r\nnot made of adamant or entirely unsusceptible to the calls of pity and\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\n"Girls," said I, "if you will be calm, I should like to ask you a few\r\nquestions."\r\n\r\n"Ask us anything," returned Isabella; "nobody has more right to our\r\nconfidence than you."\r\n\r\nThis was another of their exaggerated expressions, but I was so anxious\r\nto hear what they had to tell, I let it pass. So instead of rebuking\r\nthem, I asked where their brother had been arrested, and found it had\r\nbeen at his rooms and in presence of themselves and Franklin. So I\r\ninquired further and learned that, so far as they knew, nothing had been\r\ndiscovered beyond what had come out at the inquest except that Howard\'s\r\ntrunks had been found packed, as if he had been making preparations for\r\na journey when interrupted by the dreadful event which had put him into\r\nthe hands of the police. As there was a certain significance in this,\r\nthe girls seemed almost as much impressed by it as I was, but we did not\r\ndiscuss it long, for I suddenly changed my manner, and taking them both\r\nby the hand, asked if they could keep a secret.\r\n\r\n"Secret?" they gasped.\r\n\r\n"Yes, a secret. You are not the girls I should confide in ordinarily;\r\nbut this trouble has sobered you."\r\n\r\n"O, we can do anything," began Isabella; and "Only try us," murmured\r\nCaroline.\r\n\r\nBut knowing the volubility of the one and the weakness of the other, I\r\nshook my head at their promises, and merely tried to impress them with\r\nthe fact that their brother\'s safety depended upon their discretion. At\r\nwhich they looked very determined for poppets, and squeezed my hands so\r\ntightly that I wished I had left off some of my rings before engaging in\r\nthis interview.\r\n\r\nWhen they were quiet again and ready to listen I told them my plans.\r\nThey were surprised, of course, and wondered how I could do anything\r\ntowards finding out the real murderer of their sister-in-law; but seeing\r\nhow resolved I looked, changed their tone and avowed with much feeling\r\ntheir perfect confidence in me and in the success of anything I might\r\nundertake.\r\n\r\nThis was encouraging, and ignoring their momentary distrust, I proceeded\r\nto say:\r\n\r\n"But for me to be successful in this matter, no one must know my\r\ninterest in it. You must pay me no visits, give me no confidences, nor,\r\nif you can help it, mention my name before _any one_, not even before\r\nyour father and brother. So much for precautionary measures, my dears;\r\nand now for the active ones. I have no curiosity, as I think you must\r\nsee, but I shall have to ask you a few questions which under other\r\ncircumstances would savor more or less of impertinence. Had your\r\nsister-in-law any special admirers among the other sex?"\r\n\r\n"Oh," protested Caroline, shrinking back, while Isabella\'s eyes grew\r\nround as a frightened child\'s. "None that we ever heard of. She wasn\'t\r\nthat kind of a woman, was she, Belle? It wasn\'t for any such reason\r\npapa didn\'t like her."\r\n\r\n"No, no, _that_ would have been too dreadful. It was her family we\r\nobjected to, that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"Well, well," I apologized, tapping their hands reassuringly, "I only\r\nasked--let me now say--from curiosity, though I have not a particle of\r\nthat quality, I assure you."\r\n\r\n"Did you think--did you have any idea--" faltered Caroline, "that----"\r\n\r\n"Never mind," I interrupted. "You must let my words go in one ear and\r\nout of the other after you have answered them. I wish"--here I assumed a\r\nbrisk air--"that I could go through your parlors again before every\r\ntrace of the crime perpetrated there has been removed."\r\n\r\n"Why, you can," replied Isabella.\r\n\r\n"There is no one in them now," added Caroline, "Franklin went out just\r\nbefore we left."\r\n\r\nAt which I blandly rose, and following their leadership, soon found\r\nmyself once again in the Van Burnam mansion.\r\n\r\nMy first glance upon re-entering the parlors was naturally directed\r\ntowards the spot where the tragedy had taken place. The cabinet had been\r\nreplaced and the shelves set back upon it; but the latter were empty,\r\nand neither on them nor on the adjacent mantel-piece did I see the\r\nclock. This set me thinking, and I made up my mind to have another look\r\nat that clock. By dint of judicious questions I found that it had been\r\ncarried into the third room, where we soon found it lying on a shelf of\r\nthe same closet where the hat had been discovered by Mr. Gryce. Franklin\r\nhad put it there, fearing that the sight of it might affect Howard, and\r\nfrom the fact that the hands stood as I had left them, I gathered that\r\nneither he nor any of the family had discovered that it was in running\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nAssured of this, I astonished them by requesting to have it taken down\r\nand set up on the table, which they had no sooner done than it started\r\nto tick just as it had done under my hand a few nights before.\r\n\r\nThe girls, greatly startled, surveyed each other wonderingly.\r\n\r\n"Why, it\'s going!" cried Caroline.\r\n\r\n"Who could have wound it!" marvelled Isabella.\r\n\r\n"Hark!" I cried. The clock had begun to strike.\r\n\r\nIt gave forth five clear notes.\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s a mystery!" Isabella exclaimed. Then seeing no astonishment\r\nin my face, she added: "Did you know about this, Miss Butterworth?"\r\n\r\n"My dear girls," I hastened to say, with all the impressiveness\r\ncharacteristic of me in my more serious moments. "I do not expect you to\r\nask me for any information I do not volunteer. This is hard, I know; but\r\nsome day I will be perfectly frank with you. Are you willing to accept\r\nmy aid on these terms?"\r\n\r\n"O yes," they gasped, but they looked not a little disappointed.\r\n\r\n"And now," said I, "leave the clock where it is, and when your brother\r\ncomes home, show it to him, and say that having the curiosity to examine\r\nit you were surprised to find it going, and that you had left it there\r\nfor him to see. He will be surprised also, and as a consequence will\r\nquestion first you and then the police to find out who wound it. If they\r\nacknowledge having done it, you must notify me at once, for that\'s what\r\nI want to know. Do you understand, Caroline? And, Isabella, do you feel\r\nthat you can go through all this without dropping a word concerning me\r\nand my interest in this matter?"\r\n\r\nOf course they answered yes, and of course it was with so much\r\neffusiveness that I was obliged to remind them that they must keep a\r\ncheck on their enthusiasm, and also to suggest that they should not come\r\nto my house or send me any notes, but simply a blank card, signifying:\r\n"No one knows who wound the clock."\r\n\r\n"How delightfully mysterious!" cried Isabella. And with this girlish\r\nexclamation our talk in regard to the clock closed.\r\n\r\nThe next object that attracted our attention was a paper-covered novel I\r\ndiscovered on a side-table in the same room.\r\n\r\n"Whose is this?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Not mine."\r\n\r\n"Not mine."\r\n\r\n"Yet it was published this summer," I remarked.\r\n\r\nThey stared at me astonished, and Isabella caught up the book. It was\r\none of those summer publications intended mainly for railroad\r\ndistribution, and while neither ragged nor soiled, bore evidence of\r\nhaving been read.\r\n\r\n"Let me take it," said I.\r\n\r\nIsabella at once passed it into my hands.\r\n\r\n"Does your brother smoke?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Which brother?"\r\n\r\n"Either of them."\r\n\r\n"Franklin sometimes, but Howard, never. It disagrees with him, I\r\nbelieve."\r\n\r\n"There is a faint odor of tobacco about these pages. Can it have been\r\nbrought here by Franklin?"\r\n\r\n"O no, he never reads novels, not such novels as this, at all events. He\r\nloses a lot of pleasure, we think."\r\n\r\nI turned the pages over. The latter ones were so fresh I could almost\r\nput my finger on the spot where the reader had left off. Feeling like a\r\nbloodhound who has just run upon a trail, I returned the book to\r\nCaroline, with the injunction to put it away; adding, as I saw her air\r\nof hesitation: "If your brother Franklin misses it, it will show that he\r\nbrought it here, and then I shall have no further interest in it." Which\r\nseemed to satisfy her, for she put it away at once on a high shelf.\r\n\r\nPerceiving nothing else in these rooms of a suggestive character, I led\r\nthe way into the hall. There I had a new idea.\r\n\r\n"Which of you was the first to go through the rooms upstairs?" I\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n"Both of us," answered Isabella. "We came together. Why do you ask, Miss\r\nButterworth?"\r\n\r\n"I was wondering if you found everything in order there?"\r\n\r\n"We did not notice anything wrong, did we, Caroline? Do you think that\r\nthe--the person who committed that awful crime went _up-stairs_? I\r\ncouldn\'t sleep a wink if I thought so."\r\n\r\n"Nor I," Caroline put in. "O, don\'t say that he went up-stairs, Miss\r\nButterworth!"\r\n\r\n"I do not know it," I rejoined.\r\n\r\n"But you asked----"\r\n\r\n"And I ask again. Wasn\'t there some little thing out of its usual\r\nplace? I was up in your front chamber after water for a minute, but I\r\ndidn\'t touch anything but the mug."\r\n\r\n"We missed the mug, but--O Caroline, the pin-cushion! Do you suppose\r\nMiss Butterworth means the pin-cushion?"\r\n\r\nI started. Did she refer to the one I had picked up from the floor and\r\nplaced on a side-table?\r\n\r\n"What about the pin-cushion?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"O nothing, but we did not know what to make of its being on the table.\r\nYou see, we had a little pin-cushion shaped like a tomato which always\r\nhung at the side of our bureau. It was tied to one of the brackets and\r\nwas never taken off; Caroline having a fancy for it because it kept her\r\nfavorite black pins out of the reach of the neighbor\'s children when\r\nthey came here. Well, this cushion, this sacred cushion which none of us\r\ndared touch, was found by us on a little table by the door, with the\r\nribbon hanging from it by which it had been tied to the bureau. Some one\r\nhad pulled it off, and very roughly too, for the ribbon was all ragged\r\nand torn. But there is nothing in a little thing like that to interest\r\nyou, is there, Miss Butterworth?"\r\n\r\n"No," said I, not relating my part in the affair; "not if our neighbor\'s\r\nchildren were the marauders."\r\n\r\n"But none of them came in for days before we left."\r\n\r\n"Are there pins in the cushion?"\r\n\r\n"When we found it, do you mean? No."\r\n\r\nI did not remember seeing any, but one cannot always trust to one\'s\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\n"But you had left pins in it?"\r\n\r\n"Possibly, I don\'t remember. Why should I remember such a thing as\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\nI thought to myself, "I would know whether I left pins on my pin-cushion\r\nor not," but every one is not as methodical as I am, more\'s the pity.\r\n\r\n"Have you anywhere about you a pin like those you keep on that cushion?"\r\nI inquired of Caroline.\r\n\r\nShe felt at her belt and neck and shook her head.\r\n\r\n"I may have upstairs," she replied.\r\n\r\n"Then get me one." But before she could start, I pulled her back. "Did\r\neither of you sleep in that room last night?"\r\n\r\n"No, we were going to," answered Isabella, "but afterwards Caroline took\r\na freak to sleep in one of the rooms on the third floor. She said she\r\nwanted to get away from the parlors as far as possible."\r\n\r\n"Then I should like a peep at the one overhead."\r\n\r\nThe wrenching of the pin-cushion from its place had given me an idea.\r\n\r\nThey looked at me wistfully as they turned to mount the stairs, but I\r\ndid not enlighten them further. What would an idea be worth shared by\r\nthem!\r\n\r\nTheir father undoubtedly lay in the back room, for they moved very\r\nsoftly around the head of the stairs, but once in front they let their\r\ntongues run loose again. I, who cared nothing for their babble when it\r\ncontained no information, walked slowly about the room and finally\r\nstopped before the bed.\r\n\r\nIt had a fresh look, and I at once asked them if it had been lately made\r\nup. They assured me that it had not, saying that they always kept their\r\nbeds spread during their absence, as they did so hate to enter a room\r\ndisfigured by bare mattresses.\r\n\r\nI could have read them a lecture on the niceties of housekeeping, but I\r\nrefrained; instead of that I pointed to a little dent in the smooth\r\nsurface of the bed nearest the door.\r\n\r\n"Did either of you two make that?" I asked.\r\n\r\nThey shook their heads in amazement.\r\n\r\n"What is there in that?" began Caroline; but I motioned her to bring me\r\nthe little cushion, which she no sooner did than I laid it in the little\r\ndent, which it fitted to a nicety.\r\n\r\n"You wonderful old thing!" exclaimed Caroline. "How ever did you\r\nthink----"\r\n\r\nBut I stopped her enthusiasm with a look. I may be wonderful, but I am\r\nnot old, and it is time they knew it.\r\n\r\n"Mr. _Gryce_ is _old_," said I; and lifting the cushion, I placed it on\r\na perfectly smooth portion of the bed. "Now take it up," said I, when,\r\nlo! a second dent similar to the first.\r\n\r\n"You see where that cushion has lain before being placed on the table,"\r\nI remarked, and reminding Caroline of the pin I wanted, I took my leave\r\nand returned to my own house, leaving behind me two girls as much filled\r\nwith astonishment as the giddiness of their pates would allow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\nA DECIDED STEP FORWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nI felt that I had made an advance. It was a small one, no doubt, but it\r\nwas an advance. It would not do to rest there, however, or to draw\r\ndefinite conclusions from what I had seen without further facts to guide\r\nme. Mrs. Boppert could supply these facts, or so I believed. Accordingly\r\nI decided to visit Mrs. Boppert.\r\n\r\nNot knowing whether Mr. Gryce had thought it best to put a watch over my\r\nmovements, but taking it for granted that it would be like him to do so,\r\nI made a couple of formal calls on the avenue before I started eastward.\r\nI had learned Mrs. Boppert\'s address before leaving home, but I did not\r\nride directly to the tenement where she lived. I chose, instead, to get\r\nout at a little fancy store I saw in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious place. I never saw so many or such variety of things in\r\none small spot in my life, but I did not waste any time upon this quaint\r\ninterior, but stepped immediately up to the good woman I saw leaning\r\nover the counter.\r\n\r\n"Do you know a Mrs. Boppert who lives at 803?" I asked.\r\n\r\nThe woman\'s look was too quick and suspicious for denial; but she was\r\nabout to attempt it, when I cut her short by saying:\r\n\r\n"I wish to see Mrs. Boppert very much, but not in her own rooms. I will\r\npay any one well who will assist me to five minutes\' conversation with\r\nher in such a place, say, as that I see behind the glass door at the end\r\nof this very shop."\r\n\r\nThe woman, startled by so unexpected a proposition, drew back a step,\r\nand was about to shake her head, when I laid on the counter before her\r\n(shall I say how much? Yes, for it was not thrown away) a five-dollar\r\nbill, which she no sooner saw than she gave a gasp of delight.\r\n\r\n"Will you give me _that_?" she cried.\r\n\r\nFor answer I pushed it towards her, but before her fingers could clutch\r\nit, I resolutely said:\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Boppert must not know there is anybody waiting here to see her, or\r\nshe will not come. I have no ill-will towards her, and mean her only\r\ngood, but she\'s a timid sort of person, and----"\r\n\r\n"I know she\'s timid," broke in the good woman, eagerly. "And she\'s had\r\nenough to make her so! What with policemen drumming her up at night, and\r\ninnocent-looking girls and boys luring her into corners to tell them\r\nwhat she saw in that grand house where the murder took place, she\'s\r\ngrown that feared of her shadow you can hardly get her out after\r\nsundown. But I think I can get her here; and if you mean her no harm,\r\nwhy, ma\'am----" Her fingers were on the bill, and charmed with the feel\r\nof it, she forgot to finish her sentence.\r\n\r\n"Is there any one in the room back there?" I asked, anxious to recall\r\nher to herself.\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am, no one at all. I am a poor widder, and not used to such\r\ncompany as you; but if you will sit down, I will make myself look more\r\nfit and have Mrs. Boppert over here in a minute." And calling to some\r\none of the name of Susie to look after the shop, she led the way towards\r\nthe glass door I have mentioned.\r\n\r\nRelieved to find everything working so smoothly and determined to get\r\nthe worth of my money out of Mrs. Boppert when I saw her, I followed the\r\nwoman into the most crowded room I ever entered. The shop was nothing to\r\nit; there you could move without hitting anything; here you could not.\r\nThere were tables against every wall, and chairs where there were no\r\ntables. Opposite me was a window-ledge filled with flowering plants, and\r\nat my right a grate and mantel-piece covered, that is the latter, with\r\ninnumerable small articles which had evidently passed a long and forlorn\r\nprobation on the shop shelves before being brought in here. While I was\r\nlooking at them and marvelling at the small quantity of dust I found,\r\nthe woman herself disappeared behind a stack of boxes, for which there\r\nwas undoubtedly no room in the shop. Could she have gone for Mrs.\r\nBoppert already, or had she slipped into another room to hide the money\r\nwhich had come so unexpectedly into her hands?\r\n\r\nI was not long left in doubt, for in another moment she returned with a\r\nflower-bedecked cap on her smooth gray head, that transformed her into a\r\nfigure at once so complacent and so ridiculous that, had my nerves not\r\nbeen made of iron, I should certainly have betrayed my amusement. With\r\nit she had also put on her company manner, and what with the smiles she\r\nbestowed upon me and her perfect satisfaction with her own appearance, I\r\nhad all I could do to hold my own and keep her to the matter in hand.\r\nFinally she managed to take in my anxiety and her own duty, and saying\r\nthat Mrs. Boppert could never refuse a cup of tea, offered to send her\r\nan invitation to supper. As this struck me favorably, I nodded, at which\r\nshe cocked her head on one side and insinuatingly whispered:\r\n\r\n"And would you pay for the tea, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\nI uttered an indignant "No!" which seemed to surprise her. Immediately\r\nbecoming humble again, she replied it was no matter, that she had tea\r\nenough and that the shop would supply cakes and crackers; to all of\r\nwhich I responded with a look which awed her so completely that she\r\nalmost dropped the dishes with which she was endeavoring to set one of\r\nthe tables.\r\n\r\n"She does so hate to talk about the murder that it will be a perfect\r\ngodsend to her to drop into good company like this with no prying\r\nneighbors about. Shall I set a chair for you, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\nI declined the honor, saying that I would remain seated where I was,\r\nadding, as I saw her about to go:\r\n\r\n"Let her walk straight in, and she will be in the middle of the room\r\nbefore she sees me. That will suit her and me too; for after she has\r\nonce seen me, she won\'t be frightened. _But you are not to listen at the\r\ndoor._"\r\n\r\nThis I said with great severity, for I saw the woman was becoming very\r\ncurious, and having said it, I waved her peremptorily away.\r\n\r\nShe didn\'t like it, but a thought of the five dollars comforted her.\r\nCasting one final look at the table, which was far from uninvitingly\r\nset, she slipped out and I was left to contemplate the dozen or so\r\nphotographs that covered the walls. I found them so atrocious and their\r\narrangement so distracting to my bump of order, which is of a pronounced\r\ncharacter, that I finally shut my eyes on the whole scene, and in this\r\nattitude began to piece my thoughts together. But before I had proceeded\r\nfar, steps were heard in the shop, and the next moment the door flew\r\nopen and in popped Mrs. Boppert, with a face like a peony in full\r\nblossom. She stopped when she saw me and stared.\r\n\r\n"Why, if it isn\'t the lady----"\r\n\r\n"Hush! Shut the door. I have something very particular to say to you."\r\n\r\n"O," she began, looking as if she wanted to back out. But I was too\r\nquick for her. I shut the door myself and, taking her by the arm, seated\r\nher in the corner.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t show much gratitude," I remarked.\r\n\r\nI did not know what she had to be grateful to me for, but she had so\r\nplainly intimated at our first interview that she regarded me as having\r\ndone her some favor, that I was disposed to make what use of it I could,\r\nto gain her confidence.\r\n\r\n"I know, ma\'am, but if you could see how I\'ve been harried, ma\'am. It\'s\r\nthe murder, and nothing but the murder all the time; and it was to get\r\naway from the talk about it that I came here, ma\'am, and now it\'s you I\r\nsee, and you\'ll be talking about it too, or why be in such a place as\r\nthis, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\n"And what if I do talk about it? You know I\'m your friend, or I never\r\nwould have done you that good turn the morning we came upon the poor\r\ngirl\'s body."\r\n\r\n"I know, ma\'am, and grateful I am for it, too; but I\'ve never understood\r\nit, ma\'am. Was it to save me from being blamed by the wicked police, or\r\nwas it a dream you had, and the gentleman had, for I\'ve heard what he\r\nsaid at the inquest, and it\'s muddled my head till I don\'t know where\r\nI\'m standing."\r\n\r\nWhat I had said and what the gentleman had said! What did the poor thing\r\nmean? As I did not dare to show my ignorance, I merely shook my head.\r\n\r\n"Never mind what caused us to speak as we did, as long as we helped\r\n_you_. And we did help you? The police never found out what you had to\r\ndo with this woman\'s death, did they?"\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am, O no, ma\'am. When such a respectable lady as you said that\r\nyou saw the young lady come into the house in the middle of the night,\r\nhow was they to disbelieve it. They never asked me if I knew any\r\ndifferent."\r\n\r\n"No," said I, almost struck dumb by my success, but letting no hint of\r\nmy complacency escape me. "And I did not mean they should. You are a\r\ndecent woman, Mrs. Boppert, and should not be troubled."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, ma\'am. But how did you know she had come to the house before\r\nI left. Did you see her?"\r\n\r\nI hate a lie as I do poison, but I had to exercise all my Christian\r\nprinciples not to tell one then.\r\n\r\n"No," said I, "I didn\'t see her, but I don\'t always have to use my eyes\r\nto know what is going on in my neighbor\'s houses." Which is true enough,\r\nif it is somewhat humiliating to confess it.\r\n\r\n"O ma\'am, how smart you are, ma\'am! I wish I had some smartness in me.\r\nBut my husband had all that. He was a man--O what\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing but the tea-caddy; I knocked it over with my elbow."\r\n\r\n"How I do jump at everything! I\'m afraid of my own shadow ever since I\r\nsaw that poor thing lying under that heap of crockery."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t wonder."\r\n\r\n"She must have pulled those things over herself, don\'t you think so,\r\nma\'am? No one went in there to murder her. But how came she to have\r\nthose clothes on. She was dressed quite different when I let her in. I\r\nsay it\'s all a muddle, ma\'am, and it will be a smart man as can explain\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Or a smart woman," I thought.\r\n\r\n"Did I do wrong, ma\'am? That\'s what plagues me. She begged so hard to\r\ncome in, I didn\'t know how to shut the door on her. Besides her name was\r\nVan Burnam, or so she told me."\r\n\r\nHere was a coil. Subduing my surprise, I remarked:\r\n\r\n"If she asked you to let her in, I do not see how you could refuse her.\r\nWas it in the morning or late in the afternoon she came?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know, ma\'am? I thought you knew all about it from the way you\r\ntalked."\r\n\r\nHad I been indiscreet? Could she not bear questioning? Eying her with\r\nsome severity, I declared in a less familiar tone than any I had yet\r\nused:\r\n\r\n"Nobody knows more about it than I do, but I do not know just the hour\r\nat which this lady came to the house. But I do not ask you to tell me if\r\nyou do not want to."\r\n\r\n"O ma\'am," she humbly remonstrated, "I am sure I am willing to tell you\r\neverything. It was in the afternoon while I was doing the front basement\r\nfloor."\r\n\r\n"And she came to the basement door?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"And asked to be let in?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Young Mrs. Van Burnam?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Dressed in a black and white plaid silk, and wearing a hat covered with\r\nflowers?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am, or something like that. I know it was very bright and\r\nbecoming."\r\n\r\n"And why did she come to the basement door--a lady dressed like that?"\r\n\r\n"Because she knew I couldn\'t open the front door; that I hadn\'t the key.\r\nO she talked beautiful, ma\'am, and wasn\'t proud with me a bit. She made\r\nme let her stay in the house, and when I said it would be dark after a\r\nwhile and that I hadn\'t done nothing to the rooms upstairs, she laughed\r\nand said she didn\'t care, that she wasn\'t afraid of the dark and had\r\njust as lieve as not stay in the big house alone all night, for she had\r\na book--Did you say anything, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, go on, she had a book."\r\n\r\n"Which she could read till she got sleepy. I never thought anything\r\nwould happen to her."\r\n\r\n"Of course not, why should you? And so you let her into the house and\r\nleft her there when you went out of it? Well, I don\'t wonder you were\r\nshocked to see her lying dead on the floor next morning."\r\n\r\n"Awful, ma\'am. I was afraid they would blame me for what had happened.\r\nBut I didn\'t do nothing to make her die. I only let her stay in the\r\nhouse. Do you think they will do anything to me if they know it?"\r\n\r\n"No," said I, trying to understand this woman\'s ignorant fears, "they\r\ndon\'t punish such things. More\'s the pity!"--this in confidence to\r\nmyself. "How could you know that a piece of furniture would fall on her\r\nbefore morning. Did you lock her in when you left the house?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am. She told me to."\r\n\r\nThen she was a prisoner.\r\n\r\nConfounded by the mystery of the whole affair, I sat so still the woman\r\nlooked up in wonder, and I saw I had better continue my questions.\r\n\r\n"What reason did she give for wanting to stay in the house all night?"\r\n\r\n"What reason, ma\'am? I don\'t know. Something about her having to be\r\nthere when Mr. Van Burnam came home. I didn\'t make it out, and I didn\'t\r\ntry to. I was too busy wondering what she would have to eat."\r\n\r\n"And what did she have?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, ma\'am. She said she had something, but I didn\'t see it."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you were blinded by the money she gave you. She gave you some,\r\nof course?"\r\n\r\n"O, not much, ma\'am, not much. And I wouldn\'t have taken a cent if it\r\nhad not seemed to make her so happy to give it. The pretty, pretty\r\nthing! A real lady, whatever they say about her!"\r\n\r\n"And happy? You said she was happy, cheerful-looking, and pretty."\r\n\r\n"O yes, ma\'am; _she_ didn\'t know what was going to happen. I even heard\r\nher sing after she went up-stairs."\r\n\r\nI wished that my ears had been attending to their duty that day, and I\r\nmight have heard her sing too. But the walls between my house and that\r\nof the Van Burnams are very thick, as I have had occasion to observe\r\nmore than once.\r\n\r\n"Then she went up-stairs before you left?"\r\n\r\n"To be sure, ma\'am; what would she do in the kitchen?"\r\n\r\n"And you didn\'t see her again?"\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am; but I heard her walking around."\r\n\r\n"In the parlors, you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am, in the parlors."\r\n\r\n"You did not go up yourself?"\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am, I had enough to do below."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you go up when you went away?"\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am; I didn\'t like to."\r\n\r\n"When did you go?"\r\n\r\n"At five, ma\'am; I always go at five."\r\n\r\n"How did you know it was five?"\r\n\r\n"The kitchen clock told me; I wound it, ma\'am and set it when the\r\nwhistles blew at twelve."\r\n\r\n"Was that the only clock you wound?"\r\n\r\n"Only clock? Do you think I\'d be going around the house winding any\r\nothers?"\r\n\r\nHer face showed such surprise, and her eyes met mine so frankly, that I\r\nwas convinced she spoke the truth. Gratified--I don\'t know why,--I\r\nbestowed upon her my first smile, which seemed to affect her, for her\r\nface softened, and she looked at me quite eagerly for a minute before\r\nshe said:\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think so very bad of me, do you, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\nBut I had been struck by a thought which made me for the moment\r\noblivious to her question. _She_ had wound the clock in the kitchen for\r\nher own uses, and why may not the lady above have wound the one in the\r\nparlor for hers? Filled with this startling idea, I remarked:\r\n\r\n"The young lady wore a watch, of course?"\r\n\r\nBut the suggestion passed unheeded. Mrs. Boppert was as much absorbed in\r\nher own thoughts as I was.\r\n\r\n"Did young Mrs. Van Burnam wear a watch?" I persisted.\r\n\r\nMrs. Boppert\'s face remained a blank.\r\n\r\nProvoked at her impassibility, I shook her with an angry hand,\r\nimperatively demanding:\r\n\r\n"What are you thinking of? Why don\'t you answer my questions?"\r\n\r\nShe was herself again in an instant.\r\n\r\n"O ma\'am, I beg your pardon. I was wondering if you meant the parlor\r\nclock."\r\n\r\nI calmed myself, looked severe to hide my more than eager interest, and\r\nsharply cried:\r\n\r\n"Of course I mean the parlor clock. Did you wind it?"\r\n\r\n"O no, no, no, I would as soon think of touching gold or silver. But the\r\nyoung lady did, I\'m sure, ma\'am, for I heard it strike when she was\r\nsetting of it."\r\n\r\nAh! If my nature had not been an undemonstrative one, and if I had not\r\nbeen bred to a strong sense of social distinctions, I might have\r\nbetrayed my satisfaction at this announcement in a way that would have\r\nmade this homely German woman start. As it was I sat stock-still, and\r\neven made her think I had not heard her. Venturing to rouse _me_ a bit,\r\nshe spoke again after a minute\'s silence.\r\n\r\n"She might have been lonely, you know, ma\'am; and the ticking of a clock\r\nis such company."\r\n\r\n"Yes," I answered with more than my accustomed vivacity, for she jumped\r\nas if I had struck her. "You have hit the nail on the head, Mrs.\r\nBoppert, and are a much smarter woman than I thought. But when did she\r\nwind the clock?"\r\n\r\n"At five o\'clock, ma\'am; just before I left the house."\r\n\r\n"O, and did she know you were going?"\r\n\r\n"I think so, ma\'am, for I called up, just before I put on my bonnet,\r\nthat it was five o\'clock and that I was going."\r\n\r\n"O, you did. And did she answer back?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am. I heard her step in the hall and then her voice. She asked\r\nif I was sure it was five, and I told her yes, because I had set the\r\nkitchen clock at twelve. She didn\'t say any more, but just after that I\r\nheard the parlor clock begin to strike."\r\n\r\nO, thought I, what cannot be got out of the most stupid and unwilling\r\nwitness by patience and a judicious use of questions. To know that this\r\nclock was started after five o\'clock, that is, after the hour at which\r\nthe hands pointed when it fell, and that it was set correctly in\r\nstarting, and so would give indisputable testimony of the hour when the\r\nshelves fell, were points of the greatest importance. I was so pleased I\r\ngave the woman another smile.\r\n\r\nInstantly she cried:\r\n\r\n"But you won\'t say anything about it, will you, ma\'am? They might make\r\nme pay for all the things that were broke."\r\n\r\nMy smile this time was not one of encouragement simply. But it might\r\nhave been anything for all effect it had on her. The intricacies of the\r\naffair had disturbed her poor brain again, and all her powers of mind\r\nwere given up to lament.\r\n\r\n"O," she bemoaned, "I wish I had never seen her! My head wouldn\'t ache\r\nso with the muddle of it. Why, ma\'am, her husband said he came to the\r\nhouse at midnight with his wife! How could he when she was inside of it\r\nall the time. But then perhaps he said that, just as you did, to save me\r\nblame. But why should a gentleman like him do that?"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t worth while for you to bother your head about it," I\r\nexpostulated. "It is enough that _my_ head aches over it."\r\n\r\nI don\'t suppose she understood me or tried to. Her wits had been sorely\r\ntried and my rather severe questioning had not tended to clear them. At\r\nall events she went on in another moment as if I had not spoken:\r\n\r\n"But what became of her pretty dress? I was never so astonished in my\r\nlife as when I saw that dark skirt on her."\r\n\r\n"She might have left her fine gown upstairs," I ventured, not wishing to\r\ngo into the niceties of evidence with this woman.\r\n\r\n"So she might, so she might, and that may have been her petticoat we\r\nsaw." But in another moment she saw the impossibility of this, for she\r\nadded: "But I saw her petticoat, and it was a brown silk one. She showed\r\nit when she lifted her skirt to get at her purse. I don\'t understand it,\r\nma\'am."\r\n\r\nAs her face by this time was almost purple, I thought it a mercy to\r\nclose the interview; so I uttered some few words of a soothing and\r\nencouraging nature, and then seeing that something more tangible was\r\nnecessary to restore her to any proper condition of spirits, I took out\r\nmy pocket-book and bestowed on her some of my loose silver.\r\n\r\nThis was something she _could_ understand. She brightened immediately,\r\nand before she was well through her expressions of delight, I had\r\nquitted the room and in a few minutes later the shop.\r\n\r\nI hope the two women had their cup of tea after that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\n\r\nMISS BUTTERWORTH\'S THEORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was so excited when I entered my carriage that I rode all the way home\r\nwith my bonnet askew and never knew it. When I reached my room and saw\r\nmyself in the glass, I was shocked, and stole a glance at Lena, who was\r\nsetting out my little tea-table, to see if she noticed what a ridiculous\r\nfigure I cut. But she is discretion itself, and for a girl with two\r\nundeniable dimples in her cheeks, smiles seldom--at least when I am\r\nlooking at her. She was not smiling now, and though, for the reason\r\ngiven above, this was not as comforting as it may appear, I chose not to\r\nworry myself any longer about such a trifle when I had matters of so\r\nmuch importance on my mind.\r\n\r\nTaking off my bonnet, whose rakish appearance had given me such a shock,\r\nI sat down, and for half an hour neither moved nor spoke. I was\r\nthinking. A theory which had faintly suggested itself to me at the\r\ninquest was taking on body with these later developments. Two hats had\r\nbeen found on the scene of the tragedy, and two pairs of gloves, and now\r\nI had learned that there had been two women there, the one whom Mrs.\r\nBoppert had locked into the house on leaving it, and the one whom I had\r\nseen enter at midnight with Mr. Van Burnam. Which of the two had\r\nperished? We had been led to think, and Mr. Van Burnam had himself\r\nacknowledged, that it was his wife; but his wife had been dressed quite\r\ndifferently from the murdered woman, and was, as I soon began to see,\r\nmuch more likely to have been the assassin than the victim. Would you\r\nlike to know my reasons for this extraordinary statement? If so, they\r\nare these:\r\n\r\nI had always seen a woman\'s hand in this work, but having no reason to\r\nbelieve in the presence of any other woman on the scene of crime than\r\nthe victim, I had put this suspicion aside as untenable. But now that I\r\nhad found the second woman, I returned to it.\r\n\r\nBut how connect her with the murder? It seemed easy enough to do so if\r\nthis other woman was her rival. We have heard of no rival, but she may\r\nhave known of one, and this knowledge may have been at the bottom of her\r\ndisagreement with her husband and the half-crazy determination she\r\nevinced to win his family over to her side. Let us say, then, that the\r\nsecond woman was Mrs. Van Burnam\'s rival. That he brought her there not\r\nknowing that his wife had effected an entrance into the house; brought\r\nher there after an afternoon spent at the Hotel D----, during which he\r\nhad furnished her with a new outfit of less pronounced type, perhaps,\r\nthan that she had previously worn. The use of the two carriages and the\r\ncare they took to throw suspicion off their track, may have been part of\r\na scheme of future elopement, for I had no idea they meant to remain in\r\nMr. Van Burnam\'s house. For what purpose, then, did they go there? To\r\nmeet Mrs. Van Burnam and kill her, that their way might be clearer for\r\nflight? No; I had rather think that they went to the house without a\r\nthought of whom they would encounter, and that only after they had\r\nentered the parlors did he realize that the two women he least wished to\r\nsee together had been brought by his folly face to face.\r\n\r\nThe presence in the third room of Mrs. Van Burnam\'s hat, gloves, and\r\nnovel seemed to argue that she had spent the evening in reading by the\r\ndining-room table, but whether this was so or not, the stopping of a\r\ncarriage in front and the opening of the door by an accustomed hand\r\nundoubtedly assured her that either the old gentleman or some other\r\nmember of the family had unexpectedly arrived. She was, therefore, in or\r\nnear the parlor-door when they entered, and the shock of meeting her\r\nhated rival in company with her husband, under the very roof where she\r\nhad hoped to lay the foundations of her future happiness, must have been\r\ngreat, if not maddening. Accusations, recriminations even, did not\r\nsatisfy her. She wanted to kill; but she had no weapon. Suddenly her\r\neyes fell on the hat-pin which her more self-possessed rival had drawn\r\nfrom her hat, possibly before their encounter, and she conceived a plan\r\nwhich seemed to promise her the very revenge she sought. How she carried\r\nit out; by what means she was enabled to approach her victim and inflict\r\nwith such certainty the fatal stab which laid her enemy at her feet, can\r\nbe left to the imagination. But that she, a woman, and not Howard, a\r\nman, drove this woman\'s weapon into the stranger\'s spine, I will yet\r\nprove, or lose all faith in my own intuitions.\r\n\r\nBut if this theory is true, how about the shelves that fell at daybreak,\r\nand how about her escape from the house without detection? A little\r\nthought will explain all that. The man, horrified, no doubt, at the\r\nresult of his imprudence, and execrating the crime to which it had led,\r\nleft the house almost immediately. But the woman remained there,\r\npossibly because she had fainted, possibly because he would have nothing\r\nto do with her; and coming to herself, saw her victim\'s face staring up\r\nat her with an accusing beauty she found it impossible to meet. What\r\nshould she do to escape it? Where should she go? She hated it so she\r\ncould have trampled on it, but she restrained her passions till\r\ndaybreak, when in one wild burst of fury and hatred she drew down the\r\ncabinet upon it, and then fled the scene of horror she had herself\r\ncaused. This was at five, or, to be exact, three minutes before that\r\nhour, as shown by the clock she had carelessly set in her lighter\r\nmoments.\r\n\r\nShe escaped by the front door, which her husband had mercifully forborne\r\nto lock; and she had not been discovered by the police, because her\r\nappearance did not tally with the description which had been given them.\r\nHow did I know this? Remember the discoveries I had made in Miss Van\r\nBurnam\'s room, and allow them to assist you in understanding my\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nSome one had gone into that room; some one who wanted pins; and keeping\r\nthis fact before my eyes, I saw through the motive and actions of the\r\nescaping woman. She had on a dress separated at the waist, and finding,\r\nperhaps, a spot of blood on the skirt, she conceived the plan of\r\ncovering it with her petticoat, which was also of silk and undoubtedly\r\nas well made as many women\'s dresses. But the skirt of the gown was\r\nlonger than the petticoat and she was obliged to pin it up. Having no\r\npins herself, and finding none on the parlor floor, she went up-stairs\r\nto get some. The door at the head of the stairs was locked, but the\r\nfront room was open, so she entered there. Groping her way to the\r\nbureau, for the place was very dark, she found a pin-cushion hanging\r\nfrom a bracket. Feeling it to be full of pins, and knowing that she\r\ncould see nothing where she was, she tore it away and carried it towards\r\nthe door. Here there was some light from the skylight over the stairs,\r\nso setting the cushion down on the bed, she pinned up the skirt of her\r\ngown.\r\n\r\nWhen this was done she started away, brushing the cushion off the bed in\r\nher excitement, and fearing to be traced by her many-colored hat, or\r\nhaving no courage remaining for facing again the horror in the parlor,\r\nshe slid out without one and went, God knows whither, in her terror and\r\nremorse.\r\n\r\nSo much for my theory; now for the facts standing in the way of its\r\ncomplete acceptance. They were two: the scar on the ankle of the dead\r\ngirl, which was a peculiarity of Louise Van Burnam, and the mark of the\r\nrings on her fingers. But who had identified the scar? Her husband. No\r\none else. And if the other woman had, by some strange freak of chance, a\r\nscar also on her left foot, then the otherwise unaccountable apathy he\r\nhad shown at being told of this distinctive mark, as well as his\r\ntemerity in afterwards taking it as a basis for his false\r\nidentification, becomes equally consistent and natural; and as for the\r\nmarks of the rings, it would be strange if such a woman did not wear\r\nrings and plenty of them.\r\n\r\nHoward\'s conduct under examination and the contradiction between his\r\nfirst assertions and those that followed, all become clear in the light\r\nof this new theory. He had seen his wife kill a defenceless woman\r\nbefore his eyes, and whether influenced by his old affection for her or\r\nby his pride in her good name, he could not but be anxious to conceal\r\nher guilt even at the cost of his own truthfulness. As long then as\r\ncircumstances permitted, he preserved his indifferent attitude, and\r\ndenied that the dead woman was his wife. But when driven to the wall by\r\nthe indisputable proof which was brought forth of his wife having been\r\nin the place of murder, he saw, or thought he did, that a continued\r\ndenial on his part of Louise Van Burnam being the victim might lead\r\nsooner or later to the suspicion of her being the murderer, and\r\ninfluenced by this fear, took the sudden resolution of profiting by all\r\nthe points which the two women had in common by acknowledging, what\r\neverybody had expected him to acknowledge from the first, that the woman\r\nat the Morgue was his wife. This would exonerate her, rid him of any\r\napprehension he may have entertained of her ever returning to be a\r\ndisgrace to him, and would (and perhaps this thought influenced him\r\nmost, for who can understand such men or the passions that sway them)\r\ninsure the object of his late devotion a decent burial in a Christian\r\ncemetery. To be sure, the risk he ran was great, but the emergency was\r\ngreat, and he may not have stopped to count the cost. At all events, the\r\nfact is certain that he perjured himself when he said that it was his\r\nwife he brought to the house from the Hotel D----, and if he perjured\r\nhimself in this regard, he probably perjured himself in others, and his\r\ntestimony is not at all to be relied upon.\r\n\r\nConvinced though I was in my own mind that I had struck a truth which\r\nwould bear the closest investigation, I was not satisfied to act upon\r\nit till I had put it to the test. The means I took to do this were\r\ndaring, and quite in keeping with the whole desperate affair. They\r\npromised, however, a result important enough to make Mr. Gryce blush for\r\nthe disdain with which he had met my threats of interference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.\r\n\r\nA SHREWD CONJECTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe test of which I speak was as follows:\r\n\r\nI would advertise for a person dressed as I believed Mrs. Van Burnam to\r\nhave been when she left the scene of crime. If I received news of such a\r\nperson, I might safely consider my theory established.\r\n\r\nI accordingly wrote the following advertisement:\r\n\r\n     "Information wanted of a woman who applied for lodgings on the\r\n     morning of the eighteenth inst., dressed in a brown silk skirt\r\n     and a black and white plaid blouse of fashionable cut. She was\r\n     without a hat, or if a person so dressed wore a hat, then it\r\n     was bought early in the morning at some store, in which case\r\n     let shopkeepers take notice. The person answering this\r\n     description is eagerly sought for by her relatives, and to any\r\n     one giving positive information of the same, a liberal reward\r\n     will be paid. Please address, T. W. Alvord, ---- Liberty\r\n     Street."\r\n\r\nI purposely did not mention her personal appearance, for fear of\r\nattracting the attention of the police.\r\n\r\nThis done, I wrote the following letter:\r\n\r\n     "DEAR MISS FERGUSON:\r\n\r\n     "One clever woman recognizes another. I am clever and am not\r\n     ashamed to own it. You are clever and should not be ashamed to\r\n     be told so. I was a witness at the inquest in which you so\r\n     notably distinguished yourself, and I said then, \'There is a\r\n     woman after my own heart!\' But a truce to compliments! What I\r\n     want and ask of you to procure for me is a photograph of Mrs.\r\n     Van Burnam. I am a friend of the family, and consider them to\r\n     be in more trouble than they deserve. If I had her picture I\r\n     would show it to the Misses Van Burnam, who feel great remorse\r\n     at their treatment of her, and who want to see how she looked.\r\n     Cannot you find one in their rooms? The one in Mr. Howard\'s\r\n     room here has been confiscated by the police.[C]\r\n\r\n     "Hoping that you will feel disposed to oblige me in this--and I\r\n     assure you that my motives in making this request are most\r\n     excellent--I remain,\r\n\r\n     "Cordially yours,\r\n\r\n     "AMELIA BUTTERWORTH.\r\n\r\n     "P. S.--Address me, if you please, at 564 ---- Avenue. Care of\r\n     J. H. Denham."\r\n\r\nThis was my grocer, with whom I left word the next morning to deliver\r\nthis package in the next bushel of potatoes he sent me.\r\n\r\nMy smart little maid, Lena, carried these two communications to the east\r\nside, where she posted the letter herself and entrusted the\r\nadvertisement to a lover of hers who carried it to the _Herald_ office.\r\nWhile she was gone I tried to rest by exercising my mind in other\r\ndirections. But I could not. I kept going over Howard\'s testimony in the\r\nlight of my own theory, and remarking how the difficulty he experienced\r\nin maintaining the position he had taken, forced him into\r\ninconsistencies and far-fetched explanations. With his wife for a\r\ncompanion at the Hotel D----, his conduct both there and on the road to\r\nhis father\'s house was that of a much weaker man than his words and\r\nappearance led one to believe; but if, on the contrary, he had with him\r\na woman with whom he was about to elope (and what did the packing up of\r\nall his effects mean, if not that?), all the precautions they took\r\nseemed reasonable.\r\n\r\nLater, my mind fixed itself on one point. If it was his wife who was\r\nwith him, as he said, then the bundle they dropped at the old woman\'s\r\nfeet contained the much-talked of plaid silk. If it was not, then it was\r\na gown of some different material. Now, could this bundle be found? If\r\nit could, then why had not Mr. Gryce produced it? The sight of Mrs. Van\r\nBurnam\'s plaid silk spread out on the Coroner\'s table would have had a\r\ngreat effect in clinching the suspicion against her husband. But no\r\nplaid silk had been found (because it was not dropped in the bundle, but\r\nworn away on the murderess\'s back), and no old woman. I thought I knew\r\nthe reason of this too. There was no old woman to be found, and the\r\nbundle they carried had been got rid of some other way. What way? I\r\nwould take a walk down that same block and see, and I would take it at\r\nthe midnight hour too, for only so could I judge of the possibilities\r\nthere offered for concealing or destroying such an article.\r\n\r\nHaving made this decision, I cast about to see how I could carry it into\r\neffect. I am not a coward, but I have a respectability to maintain, and\r\nwhat errand could Miss Butterworth be supposed to have in the streets at\r\ntwelve o\'clock at night! Fortunately, I remembered that my cook had\r\ncomplained of toothache when I gave her my orders for breakfast, and\r\ngoing down at once into the kitchen, where she sat with her cheek\r\npropped up in her hand waiting for Lena, I said with an asperity which\r\nadmitted of no reply:\r\n\r\n"You have a dreadful tooth, Sarah, and you must have something done for\r\nit at once. When Lena comes home, send her to me. I am going to the\r\ndrug-store for some drops, and I want Lena to accompany me."\r\n\r\nShe looked astounded, of course, but I would not let her answer me.\r\n"Don\'t speak a word," I cried, "it will only make your toothache worse;\r\nand don\'t look as if some hobgoblin had jumped up on the kitchen table.\r\nI guess I know my duty, and just what kind of a breakfast I will have in\r\nthe morning, if you sit up all night groaning with the toothache." And I\r\nwas out of the room before she had more than begun to say that it was\r\nnot so bad, and that I needn\'t trouble, and all that, which was true\r\nenough, no doubt, but not what I wanted to hear at that moment.\r\n\r\nWhen Lena came in, I saw by the brightness of her face that she had\r\naccomplished her double errand. I therefore signified to her that I was\r\nsatisfied, and asked if she was too tired to go out again, saying quite\r\nperemptorily that Sarah was ill, and that I was going to the drug-store\r\nfor some medicine, and did not wish to go alone.\r\n\r\nLena\'s round-eyed wonder was amusing; but she is very discreet, as I\r\nhave said before, and she ventured nothing save a meek, "It\'s very late,\r\nMiss Butterworth," which was an unnecessary remark, as she soon saw.\r\n\r\nI do not like to obtrude my aristocratic tendencies too much into this\r\nnarrative, but when I found myself in the streets alone with Lena, I\r\ncould not help feeling some secret qualms lest my conduct savored of\r\nimpropriety. But the thought that I was working in the cause of truth\r\nand justice came to sustain me, and before I had gone two blocks, I felt\r\nas much at home under the midnight skies as if I were walking home from\r\nchurch on a Sunday afternoon.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain drug-store on Third Avenue where I like to deal, and\r\ntowards this I ostensibly directed my steps. But I took pains to go by\r\nthe way of Lexington Avenue and Twenty-seventh Street, and upon reaching\r\nthe block where this mysterious couple were seen, gave all my attention\r\nto the possible hiding-places it offered.\r\n\r\nLena, who had followed me like my shadow, and who was evidently too\r\ndumfounded at my freak to speak, drew up to my side as we were half-way\r\ndown it and seized me tremblingly by the arm.\r\n\r\n"Two men are coming," said she.\r\n\r\n"I am not afraid of men," was my sharp rejoinder. But I told a most\r\nabominable lie; for I am afraid of them in such places and under such\r\ncircumstances, though not under ordinary conditions, and never where the\r\ntongue is likely to be the only weapon employed.\r\n\r\nThe couple who were approaching us now seemed to be in a merry mood. But\r\nwhen they saw us keep to our own side of the way, they stopped their\r\nchaffing and allowed us to go by, with just a mocking word or two.\r\n\r\n"Sarah ought to be very much obliged to you," whispered Lena.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of Third Avenue I paused. I had seen nothing so far but\r\nbare stoops and dark area-ways. Nothing to suggest a place for the\r\ndisposal of such cumbersome articles as these persons had made way with.\r\nHad the avenue anything better to offer? I stopped under the gas-lamp at\r\nthe corner to consider, notwithstanding Lena\'s gentle pull towards the\r\ndrug-store. Looking to left and right and over the muddy crossings, I\r\nsought for inspiration. An almost obstinate belief in my own theory led\r\nme to insist in my own mind that they had encountered no old woman, and\r\nconsequently had not dropped their bundles in the open street. I even\r\nentered into an argument about it, standing there with the cable cars\r\nwhistling by me and Lena tugging away at my arm. "If," said I to myself,\r\n"the woman with him had been his wife and the whole thing nothing more\r\nthan a foolish escapade, they might have done this; but she was not his\r\nwife, and the game they were playing was serious, if they did laugh over\r\nit, and so their disposal of these tell-tale articles would be serious\r\nand such as would protect their secret. Where, then, could they have\r\nthrust them?"\r\n\r\nMy eyes, as I muttered this, were on the one shop in my line of vision\r\nthat was still open and lighted. It was the den of a Chinese laundryman,\r\nand through the windows in front I could see him still at work, ironing.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" thought I, and made such a start across the street that Lena\r\ngasped in dismay and almost fell to the ground in her frightened attempt\r\nto follow me.\r\n\r\n"Not that way!" she called. "Miss Butterworth, you are going wrong."\r\n\r\nBut I kept right on, and only stopped when I reached the laundry.\r\n\r\n"I have an errand here," I explained. "Wait in the doorway, Lena, and\r\ndon\'t act as if you thought me crazy, for I was never saner in my life."\r\n\r\nI don\'t think this reassured her much, lunatics not being supposed to be\r\nvery good judges of their own mental condition, but she was so\r\naccustomed to obey, that she drew back as I opened the door before me\r\nand entered. The surprise on the face of the poor Chinaman when he\r\nturned and saw before him a lady of years and no ordinary appearance,\r\ndaunted me for an instant. But another look only showed me that his very\r\nsurprise was inoffensive, and gathering courage from the unexpectedness\r\nof my own position, I inquired with all the politeness I could show one\r\nof his abominable nationality:\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t a gentleman and a heavily veiled lady leave a package with you a\r\nfew days ago at about the same hour of night as this?"\r\n\r\n"Some lalee clo\' washee? Yes, ma\'am. No done. She tellee me no callee\r\nfor one week."\r\n\r\n"Then that\'s all right; the lady has died very suddenly, and the\r\ngentleman gone away; you will have to keep the clothes a long time."\r\n\r\n"Me wantee money, no wantee clo\'!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll pay you for them; I don\'t care about them being ironed."\r\n\r\n"Givee tickee, givee clo\'! No givee tickee, no givee clo\'!"\r\n\r\nThis was a poser! But as I did not want the clothes so much as a look at\r\nthem, I soon got the better of this difficulty.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want them to-night," said I. "I only wanted to make sure you\r\nhad them. What night were these people here?"\r\n\r\n"Tuesday night, velly late; nicee man, nicee lalee. She wantee talk.\r\nNicee man he pullee she; I no hear if muchee stasch. All washee, see!"\r\nhe went on, dragging a basket out of the corner, "him no ilon."\r\n\r\nI was in such a quiver; so struck with amazement at my own perspicacity\r\nin surmising that here was a place where a bundle of underclothing could\r\nbe lost indefinitely, that I just stared while he turned over the\r\nclothes in the basket. For by means of the quality of the articles he\r\nwas preparing to show me, the question which had been agitating me for\r\nhours could be definitely decided. If they proved to be fine and of\r\nforeign manufacture, then Howard\'s story was true and all my fine-spun\r\ntheories must fall to the ground. But if, on the contrary, they were\r\nsuch as are usually worn by American women, then my own idea as to the\r\nidentity of the woman who left them here was established, and I could\r\nsafely consider her as the victim and Louise Van Burnam as the\r\nmurderess, unless further facts came to prove that he was the guilty\r\none, after all.\r\n\r\nThe sight of Lena\'s eyes staring at me with great anxiety through the\r\npanes of the door distracted my attention for a moment, and when I\r\nlooked again, he was holding up two or three garments before me. The\r\narticles thus revealed told their story in a moment. They were far from\r\nfine, and had even less embroidery on them than I expected.\r\n\r\n"Are there any marks on them?" I asked.\r\n\r\nHe showed me two letters stamped in indelible ink on the band of a\r\nskirt. I did not have my glasses with me, but the ink was black, and I\r\nread O. R. "The minx\'s initials," thought I.\r\n\r\nWhen I left the place my complacency was such that Lena did not know\r\nwhat to make of me. She has since informed me that I looked as if I\r\nwanted to shout Hurrah! but I cannot believe I so far forgot myself as\r\nthat. But pleased as I was, I had only discovered how one bundle had\r\nbeen disposed of. The dress and outside fixings still had to be\r\naccounted for, and I was the woman to do it.\r\n\r\nWe had mechanically moved in the direction of the drug-store and were\r\nnear the curb-stone when I reached this point in my meditations. It had\r\nrained a little while before, and a small stream was running down the\r\ngutter and emptying itself into the sewer opening. The sight of it\r\nsharpened my wits.\r\n\r\nIf I wanted to get rid of anything of a damaging character, I would drop\r\nit at the mouth of one of these holes and gently thrust it into the\r\nsewer with my foot, thought I. And never doubting that I had found an\r\nexplanation of the disappearance of the second bundle, I walked on,\r\ndeciding that if I had the police at my command I would have the sewer\r\nsearched at those four corners.\r\n\r\nWe rode home after visiting the drug-store. I was not going to subject\r\nLena or myself to another midnight walk through Twenty-seventh Street.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: This was _so_ probable, it cannot be considered an\r\nuntruth.--A. B.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.\r\n\r\nA BLANK CARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day at noon Lena brought me up a card on her tray. It was a\r\nperfectly blank one.\r\n\r\n"Miss Van Burnam\'s maid said you sent for this," was her demure\r\nannouncement.\r\n\r\n"Miss Van Burnam\'s maid is right," said I, taking the card and with it a\r\nfresh installment of courage.\r\n\r\nNothing happened for two days, then there came word from the kitchen\r\nthat a bushel of potatoes had arrived. Going down to see them, I drew\r\nfrom their midst a large square envelope, which I immediately carried to\r\nmy room. It failed to contain a photograph; but there was a letter in it\r\ncouched in these terms:\r\n\r\n     "DEAR MISS BUTTERWORTH:\r\n\r\n     "The esteem which you are good enough to express for me is\r\n     returned. I regret that I cannot oblige you. There are no\r\n     photographs to be found in Mrs. Van Burnam\'s rooms. Perhaps\r\n     this fact may be accounted for by the curiosity shown in those\r\n     apartments by a very spruce new boarder we have had from New\r\n     York. His taste for that particular quarter of the house was\r\n     such that I could not keep him away from it except by lock and\r\n     key. If there was a picture there of Mrs. Van Burnam, he took\r\n     it, for he departed very suddenly one night. I am glad he took\r\n     nothing more with him. The talks he had with my servant-girl\r\n     have almost led to my dismissing her.\r\n\r\n     "Praying your pardon for the disappointment I am forced to give\r\n     you, I remain,\r\n\r\n     "Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n     "SUSAN FERGUSON."\r\n\r\nSo! so! balked by an emissary of Mr. Gryce. Well, well, we would do\r\nwithout the photograph! Mr. Gryce might need it, but not Amelia\r\nButterworth.\r\n\r\nThis was on a Thursday, and on the evening of Saturday the long-desired\r\nclue was given me. It came in the shape of a letter brought me by Mr.\r\nAlvord.\r\n\r\nOur interview was not an agreeable one. Mr. Alvord is a clever man and\r\nan adroit one, or I should not persist in employing him as my lawyer;\r\nbut he never understood _me_. At this time, and with this letter in his\r\nhand, he understood me less than ever, which naturally called out my\r\npowers of self-assertion and led to some lively conversation between us.\r\nBut that is neither here nor there. He had brought me an answer to my\r\nadvertisement and I was presently engrossed by it. It was an uneducated\r\nwoman\'s epistle and its chirography and spelling were dreadful; so I\r\nwill just mention its contents, which were highly interesting in\r\nthemselves, as I think you will acknowledge.\r\n\r\nShe, that is, the writer, whose name, as nearly as I could make out, was\r\nBertha Desberger, knew such a person as I described, and could give me\r\nnews of her if I would come to her house in West Ninth Street at four\r\no\'clock Sunday afternoon.\r\n\r\nIf I would! I think my face must have shown my satisfaction, for Mr.\r\nAlvord, who was watching me, sarcastically remarked:\r\n\r\n"You don\'t seem to find any difficulties in that communication. Now,\r\nwhat do you think of this one?"\r\n\r\nHe held out another letter which had been directed to him, and which he\r\nhad opened. Its contents called up a shade of color to my cheek, for I\r\ndid not want to go through the annoyance of explaining myself again:\r\n\r\n     "DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\n     "From a strange advertisement which has lately appeared in the\r\n     _Herald_, I gather that information is wanted of a young woman\r\n     who on the morning of the eighteenth inst. entered my store\r\n     without any bonnet on her head, and saying she had met with an\r\n     accident, bought a hat which she immediately put on. She was\r\n     pale as a girl could be and looked so ill that I asked her if\r\n     she was well enough to be out alone; but she gave me no reply\r\n     and left the store as soon as possible. That is all I can tell\r\n     you about her."\r\n\r\nWith this was enclosed his card:\r\n\r\n     PHINEAS COX,\r\n\r\n     _Millinery_,\r\n\r\n     _Trimmed and Untrimmed Hats_,\r\n\r\n     ---- Sixth Avenue.\r\n\r\n"Now, what does this mean?" asked Mr. Alvord. "The morning of the\r\neighteenth was the morning when the murder was discovered in which you\r\nhave shown such interest."\r\n\r\n"It means," I retorted with some spirit, for simple dignity was thrown\r\naway on this man, "that I made a mistake in choosing your office as a\r\nmedium for my business communications."\r\n\r\nThis was to the point and he said no more, though he eyed the letter in\r\nmy hand very curiously, and seemed more than tempted to renew the\r\nhostilities with which we had opened our interview.\r\n\r\nHad it not been Saturday, and late in the day at that, I would have\r\nvisited Mr. Cox\'s store before I slept, but as it was I felt obliged to\r\nwait till Monday. Meanwhile I had before me the still more important\r\ninterview with Mrs. Desberger.\r\n\r\nAs I had no reason to think that my visiting any number in Ninth Street\r\nwould arouse suspicion in the police, I rode there quite boldly the next\r\nday, and with Lena at my side, entered the house of Mrs. Bertha\r\nDesberger.\r\n\r\nFor this trip I had dressed myself plainly, and drawn over my eyes--and\r\nthe puffs which I still think it becoming in a woman of my age to\r\nwear--a dotted veil, thick enough to conceal my features, without\r\nrobbing me of that aspect of benignity necessary to the success of my\r\nmission. Lena wore her usual neat gray dress, and looked the picture of\r\nall the virtues.\r\n\r\nA large brass door-plate, well rubbed, was the first sign vouchsafed us\r\nof the respectability of the house we were about to enter; and the\r\nparlor, when we were ushered into it, fully carried out the promise thus\r\nheld forth on the door-step. It was respectable, but in wretched taste\r\nas regards colors. I, who have the nicest taste in such matters, looked\r\nabout me in dismay as I encountered the greens and blues, the crimsons\r\nand the purples which everywhere surrounded me.\r\n\r\nBut I was not on a visit to a temple of art, and resolutely shutting my\r\neyes to the offending splendor about me--worsted splendor, you\r\nunderstand,--I waited with subdued expectation for the lady of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nShe came in presently, bedecked in a flowered gown that was an epitome\r\nof the blaze of colors everywhere surrounding us; but her face was a\r\ngood one, and I saw that I had neither guile nor over-much shrewdness to\r\ncontend with.\r\n\r\nShe had seen the coach at the door, and she was all smiles and flutter.\r\n\r\n"You have come for the poor girl who stopped here a few days ago," she\r\nbegan, glancing from my face to Lena\'s with an equally inquiring air,\r\nwhich in itself would have shown her utter ignorance of social\r\ndistinctions if I had not bidden Lena to keep at my side and hold her\r\nhead up as if she had business there as well as myself.\r\n\r\n"Yes," returned I, "we have. Lena here, has lost a relative (which was\r\ntrue), and knowing no other way of finding her, I suggested the\r\ninsertion of an advertisement in the paper. You read the description\r\ngiven, of course. Has the person answering it been in this house?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; she came on the morning of the eighteenth. I remember it because\r\nthat was the very day my cook left, and I have not got another one yet."\r\nShe sighed and went on. "I took a great interest in that unhappy young\r\nwoman--Was she your sister?" This, somewhat doubtfully, to Lena, who\r\nperhaps had too few colors on to suit her.\r\n\r\n"No," answered Lena, "she wasn\'t my sister, but----"\r\n\r\nI immediately took the words out of her mouth.\r\n\r\n"At what time did she come here, and how long did she stay? We want to\r\nfind her very much. Did she give you any name, or tell where she was\r\ngoing?"\r\n\r\n"She said her name was Oliver." (I thought of the O. R. on the clothes\r\nat the laundry.) "But I knew this wasn\'t so; and if she had not looked\r\nso very modest, I might have hesitated to take her in. But, lor! I can\'t\r\nresist a girl in trouble, and she was in trouble, if ever a girl was.\r\nAnd then she had money--Do you know what her trouble was?" This again to\r\nLena, and with an air at once suspicious and curious. But Lena has a\r\ngood face, too, and her frank eyes at once disarmed the weak and\r\ngood-natured woman before us.\r\n\r\n"I thought"--she went on before Lena could answer--"that whatever it\r\nwas, _you_ had nothing to do with it, nor this lady either."\r\n\r\n"No," answered Lena, seeing that I wished her to do the talking. "And we\r\ndon\'t know" (which was true enough so far as Lena went) "just what her\r\ntrouble was. Didn\'t she tell you?"\r\n\r\n"She told nothing. When she came she said she wanted to stay with me a\r\nlittle while. I sometimes take boarders----" She had twenty in the house\r\nat that minute, if she had one. Did she think I couldn\'t see the length\r\nof her dining-room table through the crack of the parlor door? "\'I can\r\npay,\' she said, which I had not doubted, for her blouse was a very\r\nexpensive one; though I thought her skirt looked queer, and her hat--Did\r\nI say she had a hat on? You seemed to doubt that fact in your\r\nadvertisement. Goodness me! if she had had no hat on, she wouldn\'t have\r\ngot as far as my parlor mat. But her blouse showed her to be a\r\nlady--and then her face--it was as white as your handkerchief there,\r\nmadam, but so sweet--I thought of the Madonna faces I had seen in\r\nCatholic churches."\r\n\r\nI started; inwardly commenting: "Madonna-like, _that_ woman!" But a\r\nglance at the room about me reassured me. The owner of such hideous\r\nsofas and chairs and of the many pictures effacing or rather defacing\r\nthe paper on the walls, could not be a judge of Madonna faces.\r\n\r\n"You admire everything that is good and lovely," I suggested, for Mrs.\r\nDesberger had paused at the movement I made.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is my nature to do so, ma\'am. I love the beautiful," and she\r\ncast a half-apologetic, half-proud look about her. "So I listened to the\r\ngirl and let her sit down in my parlor. She had had nothing to eat that\r\nmorning, and though she didn\'t ask for it, I went to order her a cup of\r\ntea, for I knew she couldn\'t get up-stairs without it. Her eyes followed\r\nme when I went out of the room in a way that haunted me, and when I came\r\nback--I shall never forget it, ma\'am--there she lay stretched out on the\r\nfloor with her face on the ground and her hands thrown out. Wasn\'t it\r\nhorrible, ma\'am? I don\'t wonder you shudder."\r\n\r\nDid I shudder? If I did, it was because I was thinking of that other\r\nwoman, the victim of this one, whom I had seen, with her face turned\r\nupward and her arms outstretched, in the gloom of Mr. Van Burnam\'s\r\nhalf-closed parlor.\r\n\r\n"She looked as if she was dead," the good woman continued, "but just as\r\nI was about to call for help, her fingers moved and I rushed to lift\r\nher. She was neither dead nor had she fainted; she was simply dumb with\r\nmisery. What could have happened to her? I have asked myself a hundred\r\ntimes."\r\n\r\nMy mouth was shut very tight, but I shut it still tighter, for the\r\ntemptation was great to cry: "She had just committed murder!" As it was,\r\nno sound whatever left my lips, and the good woman doubtless thought me\r\nno better than a stone, for she turned with a shrug to Lena, repeating\r\nstill more wistfully than before:\r\n\r\n"_Don\'t_ you know what her trouble was?"\r\n\r\nBut, of course, poor Lena had nothing to say, and the woman went on with\r\na sigh:\r\n\r\n"Well, I suppose I shall never know what had used that poor creature up\r\nso completely. But whatever it was, it gave me enough trouble, though I\r\ndo not want to complain of it, for why are we here, if not to help and\r\ncomfort the miserable. It was an hour, ma\'am; it was an hour, miss,\r\nbefore I could get that poor girl to speak; but when I did succeed, and\r\nhad got her to drink the tea and eat a bit of toast, then I felt quite\r\nrepaid by the look of gratitude she gave me and the way she clung to my\r\nsleeve when I tried to leave her for a minute. It was this sleeve,\r\nma\'am," she explained, lifting a cluster of rainbow flounces and ribbons\r\nwhich but a minute before had looked little short of ridiculous in my\r\neyes, but which in the light of the wearer\'s kind-heartedness had lost\r\nsome of their offensive appearance.\r\n\r\n"Poor Mary!" murmured Lena, with what I considered most admirable\r\npresence of mind.\r\n\r\n"What name did you say?" cried Mrs. Desberger, eager enough to learn all\r\nshe could of her late mysterious lodger.\r\n\r\n"I had rather not tell her name," protested Lena, with a timid air that\r\nadmirably fitted her rather doll-like prettiness. "_She_ didn\'t tell you\r\nwhat it was, and _I_ don\'t think I ought to."\r\n\r\nGood for little Lena! And she did not even know for whom or what she was\r\nplaying the _r\xf4le_ I had set her.\r\n\r\n"I thought you said Mary. But I won\'t be inquisitive with you. I wasn\'t\r\nso with her. But where was I in my story? Oh, I got her so she could\r\nspeak, and afterwards I helped her up-stairs; but she didn\'t stay there\r\nlong. When I came back at lunch time--I have to do my marketing no\r\nmatter what happens--I found her sitting before a table with her head on\r\nher hands. She had been weeping, but her face was quite composed now and\r\nalmost hard.\r\n\r\n"\'O you good woman!\' she cried as I came in. \'I want to thank you.\' But\r\nI wouldn\'t let her go on wasting words like that, and presently she was\r\nsaying quite wildly: \'I want to begin a new life. I want to act as if I\r\nhad never had a yesterday. I have had trouble, overwhelming trouble, but\r\nI will get something out of existence yet. I _will_ live, and in order\r\nto do so, I will work. Have you a paper, Mrs. Desberger, I want to look\r\nat the advertisements?\' I brought her a _Herald_ and went to preside at\r\nmy lunch table. When I saw her again she looked almost cheerful. \'I have\r\nfound just what I want,\' she cried, \'a companion\'s place. But I cannot\r\napply in this dress,\' and she looked at the great puffs of her silk\r\nblouse as if they gave her the horrors, though why, I cannot imagine,\r\nfor they were in the latest style and rich enough for a millionaire\'s\r\ndaughter, though as to colors I like brighter ones myself. \'Would\r\nyou\'--she was very timid about it--\'buy me some things if I gave you the\r\nmoney?\'\r\n\r\n"If there is one thing more than another that I like, it is to shop, so\r\nI expressed my willingness to oblige her, and that afternoon I set out\r\nwith a nice little sum of money to buy her some clothes. I should have\r\nenjoyed it more if she had let me do my own choosing--I saw the\r\nloveliest pink and green blouse--but she was very set about what she\r\nwanted, and so I just got her some plain things which I think even you,\r\nma\'am, would have approved of. I brought them home myself, for she\r\nwanted to apply immediately for the place she had seen advertised, but,\r\nO dear, when I went up to her room----"\r\n\r\n"Was she gone?" burst in Lena.\r\n\r\n"O no, but there was such a smudge in it, and--and I could cry when I\r\nthink of it--there in the grate were the remains of her beautiful silk\r\nblouse, all smoking and ruined. She had tried to burn it, and she had\r\nsucceeded too. I could not get a piece out as big as my hand."\r\n\r\n"But you got some of it!" blurted out Lena, guided by a look which I\r\ngave her.\r\n\r\n"Yes, scraps, it was so handsome. I think I have a bit in my work-basket\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"O get it for me," urged Lena. "I want it to remember her by."\r\n\r\n"My work-basket is here." And going to a sort of _etag\xe8re_ covered with\r\na thousand knick-knacks picked up at bargain counters, she opened a\r\nlittle cupboard and brought out a basket, from which she presently\r\npulled a small square of silk. It was, as she said, of the richest\r\nweaving, and was, as I had not the least doubt, a portion of the dress\r\nworn by Mrs. Van Burnam from Haddam.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was hers," said Lena, reading the expression of my face, and\r\nputting the scrap away very carefully in her pocket.\r\n\r\n"Well, I would have given her five dollars for that blouse," murmured\r\nMrs. Desberger, regretfully. "But girls like her are so improvident."\r\n\r\n"And did she leave that day?" I asked, seeing that it was hard for this\r\nwoman to tear her thoughts away from this coveted article.\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am. It was late, and I had but little hopes of her getting the\r\nsituation she was after. But she promised to come back if she didn\'t;\r\nand as she did not come back I decided that she was more successful than\r\nI had anticipated."\r\n\r\n"And don\'t you know where she went? Didn\'t she confide in you at all?"\r\n\r\n"No; but as there were but three advertisements for a lady-companion in\r\nthe _Herald_ that day, it will be easy to find her. Would you like to\r\nsee those advertisements? I saved them out of curiosity."\r\n\r\nI assented, as you may believe, and she brought us the clippings at\r\nonce. Two of them I read without emotion, but the third almost took my\r\nbreath away. It was an advertisement for a lady-companion accustomed to\r\nthe typewriter and of some taste in dressmaking, and the address given\r\nwas that of Miss Althorpe.\r\n\r\nIf this woman, steeped in misery and darkened by crime, should be there!\r\n\r\nAs I shall not mention Mrs. Desberger again for some time, I will here\r\nsay that at the first opportunity which presented itself I sent Lena to\r\nthe shops with orders to buy and have sent to Mrs. Desberger the ugliest\r\nand most flaunting of silk blouses that could be found on Sixth Avenue;\r\nand as Lena\'s dimples were more than usually pronounced on her return, I\r\nhave no doubt she chose one to suit the taste and warm the body of the\r\nestimable woman, whose kindly nature had made such a favorable\r\nimpression upon me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.\r\n\r\nRUTH OLIVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Mrs. Desberger\'s I rode immediately to Miss Althorpe\'s, for the\r\npurpose of satisfying myself at once as to the presence there of the\r\nunhappy fugitive I was tracing.\r\n\r\nSix o\'clock Sunday night is not a favorable hour for calling at a young\r\nlady\'s house, especially when that lady has a lover who is in the habit\r\nof taking tea with the family. But I was in a mood to transgress all\r\nrules and even to forget the rights of lovers. Besides, much is forgiven\r\na woman of my stamp, especially by a person of the good sense and\r\namiability of Miss Althorpe.\r\n\r\nThat I was not mistaken in my calculations was evident from the greeting\r\nI received. Miss Althorpe came forward as graciously and with as little\r\nsurprise in her manner as any one could expect under the circumstances,\r\nand for a moment I was so touched by her beauty and the unaffected charm\r\nof her manners that I forgot my errand and only thought of the pleasure\r\nof meeting a lady who fairly comes up to the standard one has secretly\r\nset for one\'s self. Of course she is much younger than I--some say she\r\nis only twenty-three; but a lady is a lady at any age, and Ella\r\nAlthorpe might be a model for a much older woman than myself.\r\n\r\nThe room in which we were seated was a large one, and though I could\r\nhear Mr. Stone\'s voice in the adjoining apartment, I did not fear to\r\nbroach the subject I had come to discuss.\r\n\r\n"You may think this intrusion an odd one," I began, "but I believe you\r\nadvertised a few days ago for a young lady-companion. Have you been\r\nsuited, Miss Althorpe?"\r\n\r\n"O yes; I have a young person with me whom I like very much."\r\n\r\n"Ah, you are supplied! Is she any one you know?"\r\n\r\n"No, she is a stranger, and what is more, she brought no recommendations\r\nwith her. But her appearance is so attractive and her desire for the\r\nplace was so great, that I consented to try her. And she is very\r\nsatisfactory, poor girl! very satisfactory indeed!"\r\n\r\nAh, here was an opportunity for questions. Without showing too much\r\neagerness and yet with a proper show of interest, I smilingly remarked:\r\n\r\n"No one can be called poor long who remains under your roof, Miss\r\nAlthorpe. But perhaps she has lost friends; so many nice girls are\r\nthrown upon their own resources by the death of relatives?"\r\n\r\n"She does not wear mourning; but she is in some great trouble for all\r\nthat. But this cannot interest you, Miss Butterworth; have you some\r\n_prot\xe9g\xe9_ whom you wished to recommend for the position?"\r\n\r\nI heard her, but did not answer at once. In fact, I was thinking how to\r\nproceed. Should I take her into my confidence, or should I continue in\r\nthe ambiguous manner in which I had begun. Seeing her smile, I became\r\nconscious of the awkward silence.\r\n\r\n"Pardon me," said I, resuming my best manner, "but there is something I\r\nwant to say which may strike you as peculiar."\r\n\r\n"O no," said she.\r\n\r\n"I _am_ interested in the girl you have befriended, and for very\r\ndifferent reasons from those you suppose. I fear--I have great reason to\r\nfear--that she is not just the person you would like to harbor under\r\nyour roof."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! Why, what do you know about her? Anything bad, Miss\r\nButterworth?"\r\n\r\nI shook my head, and prayed her first to tell me how the girl looked and\r\nunder what circumstances she came to her; for I was desirous of making\r\nno mistake concerning her identity with the person of whom I was in\r\nsearch.\r\n\r\n"She is a sweet-looking girl," was the answer I received; "not\r\nbeautiful, but interesting in expression and manner. She has brown\r\nhair,"--I shuddered,--"brown eyes, and a mouth that would be lovely if\r\nit ever smiled. In fact, she is very attractive and so lady-like that I\r\nhave desired to make a companion of her. But while attentive to all her\r\nduties, and manifestly grateful to me for the home I have given her, she\r\nshows so little desire for company or conversation that I have desisted\r\nfor the last day or so from urging her to speak at all. But you asked me\r\nunder what circumstances she came to me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, on what day, and at what time of day? Was she dressed well, or did\r\nher clothes look shabby?"\r\n\r\n"She came on the very day I advertised; the eighteenth--yes, it was the\r\neighteenth of this month; and she was dressed, so far as I noticed, very\r\nneatly. Indeed, her clothes appeared to be new. They needed to have\r\nbeen, for she brought nothing with her save what was contained in a\r\nsmall hand-bag."\r\n\r\n"Also new?" I suggested.\r\n\r\n"Very likely; I did not observe."\r\n\r\n"O Miss Althorpe!" I exclaimed, this time with considerable vehemence,\r\n"I fear, or rather I hope, she is the woman I want."\r\n\r\n"_You_ want!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, _I_; but I cannot tell you for what just yet. I must be sure, for\r\nI would not subject an innocent person to suspicion any more than you\r\nwould."\r\n\r\n"Suspicion! She is not honest, then? That would worry me, Miss\r\nButterworth, for the house is full now, as you know, of wedding\r\npresents, and--But I cannot believe such a thing of _her_. It is some\r\nother fault she has, less despicable and degrading."\r\n\r\n"I do not say she has any faults; I only said I feared. What name does\r\nshe go by?"\r\n\r\n"Oliver; Ruth Oliver."\r\n\r\nAgain I thought of the O. R. on the clothes at the laundry.\r\n\r\n"I wish I could see her," I ventured. "I would give anything for a peep\r\nat her face unobserved."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how I can manage _that_; she is very shy, and never shows\r\nherself in the front of the house. She even dines in her own room,\r\nhaving begged for that privilege till after I was married and the\r\nhousehold settled on a new basis. But you can go to her room with me. If\r\nshe is all right, she can have no objection to a visitor; and if she is\r\n_not_, it would be well for me to know it at once."\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said I, and rose to follow her, turning over in my mind how\r\nI should account to this young woman for my intrusion. I had just\r\narrived at what I considered a sensible conclusion, when Miss Althorpe,\r\nleaning towards me, said with a whole-souled impetuosity for which I\r\ncould not but admire her:\r\n\r\n"The girl is very nervous, she looks and acts like a person who has had\r\nsome frightful shock. Don\'t alarm her, Miss Butterworth, and don\'t\r\naccuse her of anything wrong too suddenly. Perhaps she is innocent, and\r\nperhaps if she is not innocent, she has been driven into evil by very\r\ngreat temptations. I am sorry for her, whether she is simply unhappy or\r\ndeeply remorseful. For I never saw a sweeter face, or eyes with such\r\nboundless depths of misery in them."\r\n\r\nJust what Mrs. Desberger had said! Strange, but I began to feel a\r\ncertain sort of sympathy for the wretched being I was hunting down.\r\n\r\n"I will be careful," said I. "I merely want to satisfy myself that she\r\nis the same girl I heard of last from a Mrs. Desberger."\r\n\r\nMiss Althorpe, who was now half-way up the rich staircase which makes\r\nher house one of the most remarkable in the city, turned and gave me a\r\nquick look over her shoulder.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know Mrs. Desberger," she remarked.\r\n\r\nAt which I smiled. Did she think Mrs. Desberger in society?\r\n\r\nAt the end of an upper passage-way we paused.\r\n\r\n"This is the door," whispered Miss Althorpe. "Perhaps I had better go in\r\nfirst and see if she is at all prepared for company."\r\n\r\nI was glad to have her do so, for I felt as if I needed to prepare\r\nmyself for encountering this young girl, over whom, in my mind, hung\r\nthe dreadful suspicion of murder.\r\n\r\nBut the time between Miss Althorpe\'s knock and her entrance, short as it\r\nwas, was longer than that which elapsed between her going in and her\r\nhasty reappearance.\r\n\r\n"You can have your wish," said she. "She is lying on her bed asleep, and\r\nyou can see her without being observed. But," she entreated, with a\r\npassionate grip of my arm, which proclaimed her warm nature, "doesn\'t it\r\nseem a little like taking advantage of her?"\r\n\r\n"Circumstances justify it in this case," I replied, admiring the\r\nconsideration of my hostess, but not thinking it worth while to emulate\r\nit. And with very little ceremony I pushed open the door and entered the\r\nroom of the so-called Ruth Oliver.\r\n\r\nThe hush and quiet which met me, though nothing more than I had reason\r\nto expect, gave me my first shock, and the young figure outstretched on\r\na bed of dainty whiteness, my second. Everything about me was so\r\npeaceful, and the delicate blue and white of the room so expressive of\r\ninnocence and repose, that my feet instinctively moved more softly over\r\nthe polished floor and paused, when they did pause, before that dimly\r\nshrouded bed, with something like hesitation in their usually emphatic\r\ntread.\r\n\r\nThe face of that bed\'s occupant, which I could now plainly see, may have\r\nhad an influence in producing this effect. It was so rounded with\r\nhealth, and yet so haggard with trouble. Not knowing whether Miss\r\nAlthorpe was behind me or not, but too intent upon the sleeping girl to\r\ncare, I bent over the half-averted features and studied them carefully.\r\n\r\nThey were indeed Madonna-like, something which I had not expected,\r\nnotwithstanding the assurances I had received to that effect, and while\r\ndistorted with suffering, amply accounted for the interest shown in her\r\nby the good-hearted Mrs. Desberger and the cultured Miss Althorpe.\r\n\r\nResenting this beauty, which so poorly accommodated itself to the\r\ncharacter of the woman who possessed it, I leaned nearer, searching for\r\nsome defect in her loveliness, when I saw that the struggle and anguish\r\nvisible in her expression were due to some dream she was having.\r\n\r\nMoved, even against my will, by the touching sight of her trembling\r\neyelids and working mouth, I was about to wake her when I was stopped by\r\nthe gentle touch of Miss Althorpe on my shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Is she the girl you are looking for?"\r\n\r\nI gave one quick glance around the room, and my eyes lighted on the\r\nlittle blue pin-cushion on the satin-wood bureau.\r\n\r\n"Did you put those pins there?" I asked, pointing to a dozen or more\r\nblack pins grouped in one corner.\r\n\r\n"_I_ did not, no; and I doubt if Crescenze did. Why?"\r\n\r\nI drew a small black pin from my belt where I had securely fastened it,\r\nand carrying it over to the cushion, compared it with those I saw. They\r\nwere identical.\r\n\r\n"A small matter," I inwardly decided, "but it points in the right\r\ndirection"; then, in answer to Miss Althorpe, added aloud: "I fear she\r\nis. At least I have seen no reason yet for doubting it. But I must make\r\nsure. Will you allow me to wake her?"\r\n\r\n"O it seems cruel! She is suffering enough already. See how she twists\r\nand turns!"\r\n\r\n"It will be a mercy, it seems to me, to rouse her from dreams so full of\r\npain and trouble."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, but I will leave you alone to do it. What will you say to her?\r\nHow account for your intrusion?"\r\n\r\n"O I will find means, and they won\'t be too cruel either. You had better\r\nstand back by the bureau and listen. I think I had rather not have the\r\nresponsibility of doing this thing alone."\r\n\r\nMiss Althorpe, not understanding my hesitation, and only half\r\ncomprehending my errand, gave me a doubtful look but retreated to the\r\nspot I had mentioned, and whether it was the rustle of her silk dress or\r\nwhether the dream of the girl we were watching had reached its climax, a\r\nmomentary stir took place in the outstretched form before me, and next\r\nmoment she was flinging up her hands with a cry.\r\n\r\n"O how can I touch her! She is dead, and I have never touched a dead\r\nbody."\r\n\r\nI fell back breathing hard, and Miss Althorpe\'s eyes, meeting mine, grew\r\ndark with horror. Indeed she was about to utter a cry herself, but I\r\nmade an imperative motion, and she merely shrank farther away towards\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nMeantime I had bent forward and laid my hand on the trembling figure\r\nbefore me.\r\n\r\n"Miss Oliver," I said, "rouse yourself, I pray. I have a message for you\r\nfrom Mrs. Desberger."\r\n\r\nShe turned her head, looked at me like a person in a daze, then slowly\r\nmoved and sat up.\r\n\r\n"Who are you?" she asked, surveying me and the space about her with\r\neyes which seemed to take in nothing till they lit upon Miss Althorpe\'s\r\nfigure standing in an attitude of mingled shame and sympathy by the\r\nhalf-open door.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Miss Althorpe!" she entreated, "I pray you to excuse me. I did not\r\nknow you wanted me. I have been asleep."\r\n\r\n"It is this lady who wants you," answered Miss Althorpe. "She is a\r\nfriend of mine and one in whom you can confide."\r\n\r\n"Confide!" This was a word to rouse her. She turned livid, and in her\r\neyes as she looked my way both terror and surprise were visible. "Why\r\nshould you think I had anything to confide? If I had, I should not pass\r\nby you, Miss Althorpe, for another."\r\n\r\nThere were tears in her voice, and I had to remember the victim just\r\nlaid away in Woodlawn, not to bestow much more compassion on this woman\r\nthan she rightfully deserved. She had a magnetic voice and a magnetic\r\npresence, but that was no reason why I should forget what she had done.\r\n\r\n"No one asks for your confidence," I protested, "though it might not\r\nhurt you to accept a friend whenever you can get one. I merely wish, as\r\nI said before, to give you a message from Mrs. Desberger, under whose\r\nroof you stayed before coming here."\r\n\r\n"I am obliged to you," she responded, rising to her feet, and trembling\r\nvery much. "Mrs. Desberger is a kind woman; what does she want of me?"\r\n\r\nSo I was on the right track; she acknowledged Mrs. Desberger.\r\n\r\n"Nothing but to return you this. It fell out of your pocket while you\r\nwere dressing." And I handed her the little red pin-cushion I had taken\r\nfrom the Van Burnams\' front room.\r\n\r\nShe looked at it, shrunk violently back, and with difficulty prevented\r\nherself from showing the full depth of her feelings.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything about it. It is not mine, I don\'t know it!" And\r\nher hair stirred on her forehead as she gazed at the small object lying\r\nin the palm of my hand, proving to me that she saw again before her all\r\nthe horrors of the house from which it had been taken.\r\n\r\n"Who are _you_?" she suddenly demanded, tearing her eyes from this\r\nsimple little cushion and fixing them wildly on my face. "Mrs. Desberger\r\nnever sent me this. I----"\r\n\r\n"You are right to stop there," I interposed, and then paused, feeling\r\nthat I had forced a situation which I hardly knew how to handle.\r\n\r\nThe instant\'s pause she had given herself seemed to restore her\r\nself-possession. Leaving me, she moved towards Miss Althorpe.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know who this lady is," said she, "or what her errand here with\r\nme may mean. But I hope that it is nothing that will force me to leave\r\nthis house which is my only refuge."\r\n\r\nMiss Althorpe, too greatly prejudiced in favor of this girl to hear this\r\nappeal unmoved, notwithstanding the show of guilt with which she had met\r\nmy attack, smiled faintly as she answered:\r\n\r\n"Nothing short of the best reasons would make me part from you now. If\r\nthere are such reasons, you will spare me the pain of making use of\r\nthem. I think I can so far trust you, Miss Oliver."\r\n\r\nNo answer; the young girl looked as if she could not speak.\r\n\r\n"Are there any reasons why I should not retain you in my house, Miss\r\nOliver?" the gentle mistress of many millions went on. "If there are,\r\nyou will not wish to stay, I know, when you consider how near my\r\nmarriage day is, and how undisturbed my mind should be by any cares\r\nunattending my wedding."\r\n\r\nAnd still the girl was silent, though her lips moved slightly as if she\r\nwould have spoken if she could.\r\n\r\n"But perhaps you are only unfortunate," suggested Miss Althorpe, with an\r\nalmost angelic look of pity--I don\'t often see angels in women. "If that\r\nis so, God forbid that you should leave my protection or my house. What\r\ndo you say, Miss Oliver?"\r\n\r\n"That you are God\'s messenger to me," burst from the other, as if her\r\ntongue had been suddenly loosed. "That misfortune, and not wickedness,\r\nhas driven me to your doors; and that there is no reason why I should\r\nleave you unless my secret sufferings make my presence unwelcome to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nWas this the talk of a frivolous woman caught unawares in the meshes of\r\na fearful crime? If so, she was a more accomplished actress than we had\r\nbeen led to expect even from her own words to her disgusted husband.\r\n\r\n"You look like one accustomed to tell the truth," proceeded Miss\r\nAlthorpe. "Do you not think you have made some mistake, Miss\r\nButterworth?" she asked, approaching me with an ingenuous smile.\r\n\r\nI had forgotten to caution her not to make use of my name, and when it\r\nfell from her lips I looked to see her unhappy companion recoil from me\r\nwith a scream.\r\n\r\nBut strange to say she evinced no emotion, and seeing this, I became\r\nmore distrustful of her than ever; for, for her to hear without apparent\r\ninterest the name of the chief witness in the inquest which had been\r\nheld over the remains of the woman with whose death she had been more or\r\nless intimately concerned, argued powers of duplicity such as are only\r\nassociated with guilt or an extreme simplicity of character. And she was\r\nnot simple, as the least glance from her deep eyes amply showed.\r\n\r\nRecognizing, therefore, that open measures would not do with this woman,\r\nI changed my manner at once, and responding to Miss Althorpe, with a\r\ngracious smile, remarked with an air of sudden conviction:\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I have made some mistake. Miss Oliver\'s words sound very\r\ningenuous, and I am disposed, if you are, to take her at her word. It is\r\nso easy to draw false conclusions in this world." And I put back the\r\npin-cushion into my pocket with an air of being through with the matter,\r\nwhich seemed to impose upon the young woman, for she smiled faintly,\r\nshowing a row of splendid teeth as she did so.\r\n\r\n"Let me apologize," I went on, "if I have intruded upon Miss Oliver\r\nagainst her wishes." And with one comprehensive look about the room\r\nwhich took in all that was visible of her simple wardrobe and humble\r\nbelongings, I led the way out. Miss Althorpe immediately followed.\r\n\r\n"This is a much more serious affair than I have led you to suppose," I\r\nconfided to her as soon as we were at a suitable distance from Miss\r\nOliver\'s door. "If she is the person I think her, she is amenable to\r\nlaw, and the police will have to be notified of her whereabouts."\r\n\r\n"She _has_ stolen, then?"\r\n\r\n"Her fault is a very grave one," I returned.\r\n\r\nMiss Althorpe, deeply troubled, looked about her as if for guidance. I,\r\nwho could have given it to her, made no movement to attract her\r\nattention to myself, but waited calmly for her own decision in this\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n"I wish you would let me consult Mr. Stone," she ventured at last. "I\r\nthink his judgment might help us."\r\n\r\n"I had rather take no one into our confidence,--especially no man. He\r\nwould consider your welfare only and not hers."\r\n\r\nI did not consider myself obliged to acknowledge that the work upon\r\nwhich I was engaged could not be shared by one of the male sex without\r\nlessening my triumph over Mr. Gryce.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Stone is very just," she remarked, "but he might be biased in a\r\nmatter of this kind. What way do you see out of the difficulty?"\r\n\r\n"Only this. To settle at once and unmistakably, whether she is the\r\nperson who carried certain articles from the house of a friend of mine.\r\nIf she is, there will be some evidence of the fact visible in her room\r\nor on her person. She has not been out, I believe?"\r\n\r\n"Not since she came into the house."\r\n\r\n"And has remained for the most part in her own apartment?"\r\n\r\n"Always, except when I have summoned her to my assistance."\r\n\r\n"Then what I want to know I can learn there. But how can I make my\r\ninvestigations without offence?"\r\n\r\n"What do you want to know, Miss Butterworth?"\r\n\r\n"Whether she has in her keeping some half dozen rings of considerable\r\nvalue."\r\n\r\n"Oh! she could conceal rings so easily."\r\n\r\n"She does conceal them; I have no more doubt of it than I have of my\r\nstanding here; but I must know it before I shall feel ready to call the\r\nattention of the police to her."\r\n\r\n"Yes, we should both know it. Poor girl! poor girl! to be suspected of a\r\ncrime! How great must have been her temptation!"\r\n\r\n"_I_ can manage this matter, Miss Althorpe, if you will entrust it to\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"How, Miss Butterworth?"\r\n\r\n"The girl is ill; let me take care of her."\r\n\r\n"Really ill?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, or will be so before morning. There is fever in her veins; she has\r\nworried herself ill. Oh, I will be good to her."\r\n\r\nThis in answer to a doubtful look from Miss Althorpe.\r\n\r\n"This is a difficult problem you have set me," that lady remarked after\r\na moment\'s thought. "But anything seems better than sending her away, or\r\nsending for the police. But do you suppose she will allow you in her\r\nroom?"\r\n\r\n"I think so; if her fever increases she will not notice much that goes\r\non about her, and I think it will increase; I have seen enough of\r\nsickness to be something of a judge."\r\n\r\n"And you will search her while she is unconscious?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t look so horrified, Miss Althorpe. I have promised you I will not\r\nworry her. She may need assistance in getting to bed. While I am giving\r\nit to her I can judge if there is anything concealed upon her person."\r\n\r\n"Yes, perhaps."\r\n\r\n"At all events, we shall know more than we do now. Shall I venture, Miss\r\nAlthorpe?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot say no," was the hesitating answer; "you seem so very much in\r\nearnest."\r\n\r\n"And I am in earnest. I have reasons for being; consideration for you is\r\none of them."\r\n\r\n"I do not doubt it. And now will you come down to supper, Miss\r\nButterworth?"\r\n\r\n"No," I replied. "My duty is here. Only send word to Lena that she is to\r\ndrive home and take care of my house in my absence. I shall want\r\nnothing, so do not worry about me. Join your lover now, dear; and do not\r\nbestow another thought upon this self-styled Miss Oliver or what I am\r\nabout to do in her room."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV.\r\n\r\nA HOUSE OF CARDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI did not return immediately to my patient. I waited till her supper\r\ncame up. Then I took the tray, and assured by the face of the girl who\r\nbrought it that Miss Althorpe had explained my presence in her house\r\nsufficiently for me to feel at my ease before her servants, I carried in\r\nthe dainty repast she had provided and set it down on the table.\r\n\r\nThe poor woman was standing where we had left her; but her whole figure\r\nshowed languor, and she more than leaned against the bedpost behind her.\r\nAs I looked up from the tray and met her eyes, she shuddered and seemed\r\nto be endeavoring to understand who I was and what I was doing in her\r\nroom. My premonitions in regard to her were well based. She was in a\r\nraging fever, and was already more than half oblivious to her\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nApproaching her, I spoke as gently as I could, for her hapless condition\r\nappealed to me in spite of my well founded prejudices against her; and\r\nseeing she was growing incapable of response, I drew her up on the bed\r\nand began to undress her.\r\n\r\nI half expected her to recoil at this, or at least to make some show of\r\nalarm, but she submitted to my ministrations almost gratefully, and\r\nneither shrank nor questioned me till I laid my hands upon her shoes.\r\nThen indeed she quivered, and drew her feet away with such an appearance\r\nof terror that I was forced to desist from my efforts or drive her into\r\nviolent delirium.\r\n\r\nThis satisfied me that Louise Van Burnam lay before me. The scar\r\nconcerning which so much had been said in the papers would be ever\r\npresent in the thoughts of this woman as the tell-tale mark by which she\r\nmight be known, and though at this moment she was on the borders of\r\nunconsciousness, the instinct of self-preservation still remained in\r\nsufficient force to prompt her to make this effort to protect herself\r\nfrom discovery.\r\n\r\nI had told Miss Althorpe that my chief reason for intruding upon Miss\r\nOliver, was to determine if she had in her possession certain rings\r\nsupposed to have been taken from a friend of mine; and while this was in\r\na measure true--the rings being an important factor in the proof I was\r\naccumulating against her,--I was not so anxious to search for them at\r\nthis time as to find the scar which would settle at once the question of\r\nher identity.\r\n\r\nWhen she drew her foot away from me then, so violently, I saw that I\r\nneeded to search no farther for the evidence required, and could give\r\nmyself up to making her comfortable. So I bathed her temples, now\r\nthrobbing with heat, and soon had the satisfaction of seeing her fall\r\ninto a deep and uneasy slumber. Then I tried again to draw off her\r\nshoes, but the start she gave and the smothered cry which escaped her\r\nwarned me that I must wait yet longer before satisfying my curiosity; so\r\nI desisted at once, and out of pure compassion left her to get what good\r\nshe might from the lethargy into which she had fallen.\r\n\r\nBeing hungry, or at least feeling the necessity of some slight aliment\r\nto help me sustain the fatigues of the night, I sat down now at the\r\ntable and partook of some of the dainties with which Miss Althorpe had\r\nkindly provided me. After which I made out a list of such articles as\r\nwere necessary to my proper care of the patient who had so strangely\r\nfallen into my hands, and then, feeling that I had a right at last to\r\nindulge in pure curiosity, I turned my attention to the clothing I had\r\ntaken from the self-styled Miss Oliver.\r\n\r\nThe dress was a simple gray one, and the skirts and underclothing all\r\nwhite. But the latter was of the finest texture, and convinced me,\r\nbefore I had given them more than a glance, that they were the property\r\nof Howard Van Burnam\'s wife. For, besides the exquisite quality of the\r\nmaterial, there were to be seen, on the edges of the bands and sleeves,\r\nthe marks of stitches and clinging threads of lace, where the trimming\r\nhad been torn off, and in one article especially, there were tucks such\r\nas you see come from the hands of French needlewomen only.\r\n\r\nThis, taken with what had gone before, was proof enough to satisfy me\r\nthat I was on the right track, and after Crescenze had come and gone\r\nwith the tray and all was quiet in this remote part of the house, I\r\nventured to open a closet door at the foot of the bed. A brown silk\r\nskirt was hanging within, and in the pocket of that skirt I found a\r\npurse so gay and costly that all doubt vanished as to its being the\r\nproperty of Howard\'s luxurious wife.\r\n\r\nThere were several bills in this purse, amounting to about fifteen\r\ndollars in money, but no change and no memoranda, which latter seemed a\r\npity. Restoring the purse to its place and the skirt to its peg, I came\r\nsoftly back to the bedside and examined my patient still more carefully\r\nthan I had done before. She was asleep and breathing heavily, but even\r\nwith this disadvantage her face had its own attraction, an attraction\r\nwhich evidently had more or less influenced men, and which, for the\r\nreason perhaps that I have something masculine in my nature, I\r\ndiscovered to be more or less influencing me, notwithstanding my hatred\r\nof an intriguing character.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was not her beauty I came to study, but her hair, her\r\ncomplexion, and her hands. The former was brown, the brown of that same\r\nlock I remembered to have seen in the jury\'s hands at the inquest; and\r\nher skin, where fever had not flushed it, was white and smooth. So were\r\nher hands, and yet they were not a lady\'s hands. That I noticed when I\r\nfirst saw her. The marks of the rings she no longer wore, were not\r\nenough to blind me to the fact that her fingers lacked the distinctive\r\nshape and nicety of Miss Althorpe\'s, say, or even of the Misses Van\r\nBurnam; and though I do not object to this, for I like strong-looking,\r\ncapable hands myself, they served to help me understand the face, which\r\notherwise would have looked too spiritual for a woman of the peevish and\r\nself-satisfied character of Louise Van Burnam. On this innocent and\r\nappealing expression she had traded in her short and none too happy\r\ncareer. And as I noted it, I recalled a sentence in Miss Ferguson\'s\r\ntestimony, in which she alluded to Mrs. Van Burnam\'s confidential remark\r\nto her husband upon the power she exercised over people when she raised\r\nher eyes in entreaty towards them. "Am I not pretty," she had said,\r\n"when I am in distress and looking up in this way?" It was the\r\nsuggestion of a scheming woman, but from what I had seen and was seeing\r\nof the woman before me, I could imagine the picture she would thus make,\r\nand I do not think she overrated its effects.\r\n\r\nWithdrawing from her side once more, I made a tour of the room. Nothing\r\nescaped my eyes; nothing was too small to engage my attention. But while\r\nI failed to see anything calculated to shake my confidence in the\r\nconclusions I had come to, I saw but little to confirm them. This was\r\nnot strange; for, apart from a few toilet articles and some\r\nknitting-work on a shelf, she appeared to have no belongings; everything\r\nelse in sight being manifestly the property of Miss Althorpe. Even the\r\nbureau drawers were empty, and her bag, found under a small table, had\r\nnot so much in it as a hair-pin, though I searched it inside and out for\r\nher rings, which I was positive she had with her, even if she dared not\r\nwear them.\r\n\r\nWhen every spot was exhausted I sat down and began to brood over what\r\nlay before this poor being, whose flight and the great efforts she made\r\nat concealment proved only too conclusively the fatal part she had\r\nplayed in the crime for which her husband had been arrested. I had\r\nreached her arraignment before a magistrate, and was already imagining\r\nher face with the appeal in it which such an occasion would call forth,\r\nwhen there came a low knock at the door, and Miss Althorpe re-entered.\r\n\r\nShe had just said good-night to her lover, and her face recalled to me a\r\ntime when my own cheek was round and my eye was bright and--Well! what\r\nis the use of dwelling on matters so long buried in oblivion! A\r\nmaiden-woman, as independent as myself, need not envy any girl the\r\ndoubtful blessing of a husband. I chose to be independent, and I am, and\r\nwhat more is there to be said about it? Pardon the digression.\r\n\r\n"Is Miss Oliver any better?" asked Miss Althorpe; "and have you\r\nfound----"\r\n\r\nI put up my finger in warning. Of all things, it was most necessary that\r\nthe sick woman should not know my real reason for being there.\r\n\r\n"She is asleep," I answered quietly, "and I _think_ I have found out\r\nwhat is the matter with her."\r\n\r\nMiss Althorpe seemed to understand. She cast a look of solicitude\r\ntowards the bed and then turned towards me.\r\n\r\n"I cannot rest," said she, "and will sit with you for a little while, if\r\nyou don\'t mind."\r\n\r\nI felt the implied compliment keenly.\r\n\r\n"You can do me no greater favor," I returned.\r\n\r\nShe drew up an easy-chair. "That is for you," she smiled, and sat down\r\nin a little low rocker at my side.\r\n\r\nBut she did not talk. Her thoughts seemed to have recurred to some very\r\nnear and sweet memory, for she smiled softly to herself and looked so\r\ndeeply happy that I could not resist saying:\r\n\r\n"These are delightful days for you, Miss Althorpe."\r\n\r\nShe sighed softly--how much a sigh can reveal!--and looked up at me\r\nbrightly. I think she was glad I spoke. Even such reserved natures as\r\nhers have their moments of weakness, and she had no mother or sister to\r\nappeal to.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she replied, "I am very happy; happier than most girls are, I\r\nthink, just before marriage. It is such a revelation to me--this\r\ndevotion and admiration from one I love. I have had so little of it in\r\nmy life. My father----"\r\n\r\nShe stopped; I knew why she stopped. I gave her a look of encouragement.\r\n\r\n"People have always been anxious for my happiness, and have warned me\r\nagainst matrimony since I was old enough to know the difference between\r\npoverty and wealth. Before I was out of short dresses I was warned\r\nagainst fortune-seekers. It was not good advice; it has stood in the way\r\nof my happiness all my life, made me distrustful and unnaturally\r\nreserved. But now--ah, Miss Butterworth, Mr. Stone is so estimable a\r\nman, so brilliant and so universally admired, that all my doubts of\r\nmanly worth and disinterestedness have disappeared as if by magic. I\r\ntrust him implicitly, and--Do I talk too freely? Do you object to such\r\nconfidences as these?"\r\n\r\n"On the contrary," I answered. I liked Miss Althorpe so much and agreed\r\nwith her so thoroughly in her opinion of this man, that it was a real\r\npleasure to me to hear her speak so unreservedly.\r\n\r\n"We are not a foolish couple," she went on, warming with the charm of\r\nher topic till she looked beautiful in the half light thrown upon her by\r\nthe shaded lamp. "We are interested in people and things, and get half\r\nour delight from the perfect congeniality of our natures. Mr. Stone has\r\ngiven up his club and all his bachelor pursuits since he knew me,\r\nand----"\r\n\r\nO love, if at any time in my life I have despised thee, I did not\r\ndespise thee then! The look with which she finished this sentence would\r\nhave moved a cynic.\r\n\r\n"Forgive me," she prayed. "It is the first time I have poured out my\r\nheart to any one of my own sex. It must sound strange to you, but it\r\nseemed natural while I was doing it, for you looked as if you could\r\nunderstand."\r\n\r\nThis to me, to _me_, Amelia Butterworth, of whom men have said I had no\r\nmore sentiment than a wooden image. I looked my appreciation, and she,\r\nblushing slightly, whispered in a delicious tone of mingled shyness and\r\npride:\r\n\r\n"Only two weeks now, and I shall have some one to stand between me and\r\nthe world. _You_ have never needed any one, Miss Butterworth, for you do\r\nnot fear the world, but it awes and troubles me, and my whole heart\r\nglows with the thought that I shall be no longer alone in my sorrows or\r\nmy joys, my perplexities or my doubts. Am I to blame for anticipating\r\nthis with so much happiness?"\r\n\r\nI sighed. It was a less eloquent sigh than hers, but it was a distinct\r\none and it had a distinct echo. Lifting my eyes, for I sat so as to face\r\nthe bed, I was startled to observe my patient leaning towards us from\r\nher pillows, and staring upon us with eyes too hollow for tears but\r\nfilled with unfathomable grief and yearning.\r\n\r\nShe had heard this talk of love, she, the forsaken and crime-stained\r\none. I shuddered and laid my hand on Miss Althorpe\'s.\r\n\r\nBut I did not seek to stop the conversation, for as our looks met, the\r\nsick woman fell back and lapsed, or seemed to lapse, into immediate\r\ninsensibility again.\r\n\r\n"Is Miss Oliver worse?" inquired Miss Althorpe.\r\n\r\nI rose and went to the bedside, renewed the bandages on my patient\'s\r\nhead, and forced a drop or two of medicine between her half-shut lips.\r\n\r\n"No," I returned, "I think her fever is abating." And it was, though\r\nthe suffering on her face was yet heart-rendingly apparent.\r\n\r\n"Is she asleep?"\r\n\r\n"She seems to be."\r\n\r\nMiss Althorpe made an effort.\r\n\r\n"I am not going to talk any more about myself." Then as I came back and\r\nsat down by her side, she quietly asked:\r\n\r\n"What do you think of the Van Burnam murder?"\r\n\r\nDismayed at the introduction of this topic, I was about to put my hand\r\nover her mouth, when I noticed that her words had made no evident\r\nimpression upon my patient, who lay quietly and with a more composed\r\nexpression than when I left her bedside. This assured me, as nothing\r\nelse could have done, that she was really asleep, or in that lethargic\r\nstate which closes the eyes and ears to what is going on.\r\n\r\n"I think," said I, "that the young man Howard stands in a very\r\nunfortunate position. Circumstances certainly do look very black against\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"It is dreadful, unprecedently dreadful. I do not know what to think of\r\nit all. The Van Burnams have borne so good a name, and Franklin\r\nespecially is held in such high esteem. I don\'t think anything more\r\nshocking has ever happened in this city, do you, Miss Butterworth? You\r\nsaw it all, and should know. Poor, poor Mrs. Van Burnam!"\r\n\r\n"She is to be pitied!" I remarked, my eyes fixed on the immovable face\r\nof my patient.\r\n\r\n"When I heard that a young woman had been found dead in the Van Burnam\r\nmansion," Miss Althorpe pursued with such evident interest in this new\r\ntheme that I did not care to interrupt her unless driven to it by some\r\ntoken of consciousness on the part of my patient, "my thoughts flew\r\ninstinctively to Howard\'s wife. Though why, I cannot say, for I never\r\nhad any reason to expect so tragic a termination to their marriage\r\nrelations. And I cannot believe now that he killed her, can you, Miss\r\nButterworth? Howard has too much of the gentleman in him to do a brutal\r\nthing, and there was brutality as well as adroitness in the perpetration\r\nof this crime. Have you thought of that, Miss Butterworth?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," I nodded, "I have looked at the crime on all sides."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Stone," said she, "feels dreadfully over the part he was forced to\r\nplay at the inquest. But he had no choice, the police would have his\r\ntestimony."\r\n\r\n"That was right," I declared.\r\n\r\n"It has made us doubly anxious to have Howard free himself. But he does\r\nnot seem able to do so. If his wife had only known----"\r\n\r\nWas there a quiver in the lids I was watching? I half raised my hand and\r\nthen I let it drop again, convinced that I had been mistaken. Miss\r\nAlthorpe at once continued:\r\n\r\n"She was not a bad-hearted woman, only vain and frivolous. She had set\r\nher heart on ruling in the great leather-merchant\'s house, and she did\r\nnot know how to bear her disappointment. I have sympathy for her myself.\r\nWhen I saw her----"\r\n\r\nSaw her! I started, upsetting a small work-basket at my side which for\r\nonce I did not stop to pick up.\r\n\r\n"You have seen her!" I repeated, dropping my eyes from the patient to\r\nfix them in my unbounded astonishment on Miss Althorpe\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Yes, more than once. She was--if she were living I would not repeat\r\nthis--a nursery governess in a family where I once visited. That was\r\nbefore her marriage; before she had met either Howard or Franklin Van\r\nBurnam."\r\n\r\nI was so overwhelmed, that for once I found difficulty in speaking. I\r\nglanced from her to the white form in the shrouded bed, and back again\r\nin ever-growing astonishment and dismay.\r\n\r\n"You have seen her!" I at last reiterated in what I meant to be a\r\nwhisper, but which fell little short of being a cry, "and you took in\r\nthis girl?"\r\n\r\nHer surprise at this burst was almost equal to mine.\r\n\r\n"Yes, why not; what have they in common?"\r\n\r\nI sank back, my house of cards was trembling to its foundations.\r\n\r\n"Do they--do they not look alike?" I gasped. "I thought--I imagined----"\r\n\r\n"Louise Van Burnam look like that girl! O no, they were very different\r\nsort of women. What made you think there was any resemblance between\r\nthem?"\r\n\r\nI did not answer her; the structure I had reared with such care and\r\ncircumspection had fallen about my ears and I lay gasping under the\r\nruins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV.\r\n\r\n"THE RINGS! WHERE ARE THE RINGS?"\r\n\r\n\r\nHad Mr. Gryce been present, I would have instantly triumphed over my\r\ndisappointment, bottled up my chagrin, and been the inscrutable Amelia\r\nButterworth before he could say, "Something has gone wrong with this\r\nwoman!" But Mr. Gryce was not present, and though I did not betray the\r\nhalf I felt. I yet showed enough emotion for Miss Althorpe to remark:\r\n\r\n"You seemed surprised by what I have told you. Has any one said that\r\nthese two women were alike?"\r\n\r\nHaving to speak, I became myself again in a trice, and nodded\r\nvigorously.\r\n\r\n"Some one was so foolish," I remarked.\r\n\r\nMiss Althorpe looked thoughtful. While she was interested she was not so\r\ninterested as to take the subject in fully. Her own concerns made her\r\nabstracted, and I was very glad of it.\r\n\r\n"Louise Van Burnam had a sharp chin and a very cold blue eye. Yet her\r\nface was a fascinating one to some."\r\n\r\n"Well, it was a dreadful tragedy!" I observed, and tried to turn the\r\nsubject aside, which fortunately I was able to do after a short effort.\r\n\r\nThen I picked the basket up, and perceiving the sick woman\'s lips\r\nfaintly moving, I went over to her and found her murmuring to herself.\r\n\r\nAs Miss Althorpe had risen when I did, I did not dare to listen to these\r\nmurmurs, but when my charming hostess had bidden me good-night, with\r\nmany injunctions not to tire myself, and to be sure and remember that a\r\ndecanter and a plate of biscuits stood on a table outside, I hastened\r\nback to the bedside, and leaning over my patient, endeavored to catch\r\nthe words as they fell from her lips.\r\n\r\nAs they were simple and but the echo of those running at that very\r\nmoment through my own brain, I had no difficulty in distinguishing them.\r\n\r\n"Van Burnam!" she was saying, "Van Burnam!" varied by a short "Howard!"\r\nand once by a doubtful "Franklin!"\r\n\r\n"Ah," thought I, with a sudden reaction, "she is the woman I seek, if\r\nshe is not Louise Van Burnam." And unheeding the start she gave, I\r\npulled off the blanket I had spread over her, and willy-nilly drew off\r\nher left shoe and stocking.\r\n\r\nHer bare ankle showed no scar, and covering it quickly up I took up her\r\nshoe. Immediately the trepidation she had shown at the approach of a\r\nstranger\'s hand towards that article of clothing was explained. In the\r\nlining around the top were sewn bills of no ordinary amount, and as the\r\nother shoe was probably used as a like depository, she naturally felt\r\nconcern at any approach which might lead to a discovery of her little\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\nAmazed at a mystery possessing so many points of interest, I tucked the\r\nshoe in under the bedclothes and sat down to review the situation.\r\n\r\nThe mistake I had made was in concluding that because the fugitive whose\r\ntraces I had followed had worn the clothes of Louise Van Burnam, she\r\nmust necessarily be that unfortunate lady. Now I saw that the murdered\r\nwoman was Howard\'s wife after all, and this patient of mine her probable\r\nrival.\r\n\r\nBut this necessitated an entire change in my whole line of reasoning. If\r\nthe rival and not the wife lay before me, then which of the two\r\naccompanied him to the scene of tragedy? He had said it was his wife; I\r\nhad proven to myself that it was the rival; was he right, or was I\r\nright, or were neither of us right?\r\n\r\nNot being able to decide, I fixed my mind upon another query. When did\r\nthe two women exchange clothes, or rather, when did this woman procure\r\nthe silk habiliments and elaborate adornments of her more opulent rival?\r\nWas it before either of them entered Mr. Van Burnam\'s house? Or was it\r\nafter their encounter there?\r\n\r\nRunning over in my mind certain little facts of which I had hitherto\r\nattempted no explanation, I grouped them together and sought amongst\r\nthem for inspiration.\r\n\r\nThese are the facts:\r\n\r\n1. One of the garments found on the murdered woman had been torn down\r\nthe back. As it was a new one, it had evidently been subjected to some\r\nquick strain, not explainable by any appearance of struggle.\r\n\r\n2. The shoes and stockings found on the victim were the only articles\r\nshe wore which could not be traced back to Altman\'s. In the re-dressing\r\nof the so-called Mrs. James Pope, these articles had not been changed.\r\nCould not that fact be explained by the presence of a considerable sum\r\nof money in her shoes?\r\n\r\n3. The going out bareheaded of a fugitive, anxious to avoid observation,\r\nleaving hat and gloves behind her in a dining-room closet.\r\n\r\nI had endeavored to explain this last anomalous action by her fear of\r\nbeing traced by so conspicuous an article as this hat; but it was not a\r\nsatisfactory explanation to me then and much less so now.\r\n\r\n4. And last, and most vital of all, the words which I had heard fall\r\nfrom this half-conscious girl: "_O how can I touch her! She is dead, and\r\nI have never touched a dead body!_"\r\n\r\nCould inspiration fail me before such a list? Was it not evident that\r\nthe change had been made after death, and by this seemingly sensitive\r\ngirl\'s own hands?\r\n\r\nIt was a horrible thought and led to others more horrible. For the very\r\ncommission of such a revolting act argued a desire for concealment only\r\nto be explained by great guilt. She had been the offender and the wife\r\nthe victim; and Howard--Well, his actions continued to be a mystery, but\r\nI would not admit his guilt even now. On the contrary, I saw his\r\ninnocence in a still stronger light. For if he had openly or even\r\ncovertly connived at his wife\'s death, would he have so immediately\r\nforsaken the accomplice of his guilt, to say nothing of leaving to her\r\nthe dreadful task of concealing the crime? No, I would rather think that\r\nthe tragedy took place after his departure, and that his action in\r\ndenying his wife\'s identity, as long as it was possible to do so, was to\r\nbe explained by the fact of his ignorance in regard to his wife\'s\r\npresence in the house where he had supposed himself to have simply left\r\nher rival. As the exchange made in the clothing worn by the two women\r\ncould only have taken place later, and as he naturally judged the\r\nvictim by her clothing, perhaps he was really deceived himself as to her\r\nidentity. It was certainly not an improbable supposition, and accounted\r\nfor much that was otherwise inexplicable in Mr. Van Burnam\'s conduct.\r\n\r\nBut the rings? Why could I not find the rings? If my present reasoning\r\nwere correct, this woman should have those evidences of guilt about her.\r\nBut had I not searched for them in every available place without\r\nsuccess? Annoyed at my failure to fix this one irrefutable proof of\r\nguilt upon her, I took up the knitting-work I saw in Miss Oliver\'s\r\nbasket, and began to ply the needles by way of relief to my thoughts.\r\nBut I had no sooner got well under way than some movement on the part of\r\nmy patient drew my attention again to the bed, and I was startled by\r\nbeholding her sitting up again, but this time with a look of fear rather\r\nthan of suffering on her features.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t!" she gasped, pointing with an unsteady hand at the work in my\r\nhand. "The click, click of the needles is more than I can stand. Put\r\nthem down, pray; put them down!"\r\n\r\nHer agitation was so great and her nervousness so apparent that I\r\ncomplied at once. However much I might be affected by her guilt, I was\r\nnot willing to do the slightest thing to worry her nerves even at the\r\nexpense of my own. As the needles fell from my hand, she sank back and a\r\nquick, short sigh escaped her lips. Then she was again quiet, and I\r\nallowed my thoughts to return to the old theme. The rings! the rings!\r\nWhere were the rings, and was it impossible for me to find them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI.\r\n\r\nA TILT WITH MR. GRYCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt seven o\'clock the next morning my patient was resting so quietly that\r\nI considered it safe to leave her for a short time. So I informed Miss\r\nAlthorpe that I was obliged to go down-town on an important errand, and\r\nrequested Crescenze to watch over the sick girl in my absence. As she\r\nagreed to this, I left the house as soon as breakfast was over and went\r\nimmediately in search of Mr. Gryce. I wished to make sure that he knew\r\nnothing about the rings.\r\n\r\nIt was eleven o\'clock before I succeeded in finding him. As I was\r\ncertain that a direct question would bring no answer, I dissembled my\r\nreal intention as much as my principles would allow, and accosted him\r\nwith the eager look of one who has great news to impart.\r\n\r\n"O, Mr. Gryce!" I impetuously cried, just as if I were really the weak\r\nwoman he thought me, "I have found something; something in connection\r\nwith the Van Burnam murder. You know I promised to busy myself about it\r\nif you arrested Howard Van Burnam."\r\n\r\nHis smile was tantalizing in the extreme. "Found something?" he\r\nrepeated. "And may I ask if you have been so good as to bring it with\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\nHe was playing with me, this aged and reputable detective. I subdued my\r\nanger, subdued my indignation even, and smiling much in his own way,\r\nanswered briefly:\r\n\r\n"I never carry valuables on my person. A half-dozen expensive rings\r\nstand for too much money for me to run any undue risk with them."\r\n\r\nHe was caressing his watch-chain as I spoke, and I noticed that he\r\npaused in this action for just an infinitesimal length of time as I said\r\nthe word rings. Then he went on as before, but I knew I had caught his\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n"Of what rings do you speak, madam? Of those missing from Mrs. Van\r\nBurnam\'s hands?"\r\n\r\nI took a leaf from his book, and allowed myself to indulge in a little\r\nbanter.\r\n\r\n"O, no," I remonstrated, "not those rings, of course. The Queen of\r\nSiam\'s rings, any rings but those in which we are specially interested."\r\n\r\nThis meeting him on his own ground evidently puzzled him.\r\n\r\n"You are facetious, madam. What am I to gather from such levity? That\r\nsuccess has crowned your efforts, and that you have found a guiltier\r\nparty than the one now in custody?"\r\n\r\n"Possibly," I returned, limiting my advance by his. "But it would be\r\ngoing too fast to mention that yet. What I want to know is whether _you_\r\nhave found the rings belonging to Mrs. Van Burnam?"\r\n\r\nMy triumphant tone, the almost mocking accent I purposely gave to the\r\nword _you_, accomplished its purpose. He never dreamed I was playing\r\nwith him; he thought I was bursting with pride; and casting me a sharp\r\nglance (the first, by the way, I had received from him), he inquired\r\nwith perceptible interest:\r\n\r\n"Have _you?_"\r\n\r\nInstantly convinced that the whereabouts of these jewels was as little\r\nknown to him as to me, I rose and prepared to leave. But seeing that he\r\nwas not satisfied, and that he expected an answer, I assumed a\r\nmysterious air and quietly remarked:\r\n\r\n"If you will come to my house to-morrow I will explain myself. I am not\r\nprepared to more than intimate my discoveries to-day."\r\n\r\nBut he was not the man to let one off so easily.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me," said he, "but matters of this kind do not admit of delay.\r\nThe grand jury sits within the week, and any evidence worth presenting\r\nthem must be collected at once. I must ask you to be frank with me, Miss\r\nButterworth."\r\n\r\n"And I will be, to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"To-day," he insisted, "to-day."\r\n\r\nSeeing that I should gain nothing by my present course, I reseated\r\nmyself, bestowing upon him a decidedly ambiguous smile as I did so.\r\n\r\n"You acknowledge then," said I, "that the old maid can tell you\r\nsomething after all. I thought you regarded all my efforts in the light\r\nof a jest. What has made you change your mind?"\r\n\r\n"Madam, I decline to bandy words. Have you found those rings, or have\r\nyou not?"\r\n\r\n"I have _not_," said I, "but neither have you, and as that is what I\r\nwanted to make sure of, I will now take my leave without further\r\nceremony."\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce is not a profane man, but he allowed a word to slip from him\r\nwhich was not entirely one of blessing. He made amends for it next\r\nmoment, however, by remarking:\r\n\r\n"Madam, I once said, as you will doubtless remember, that the day would\r\ncome when I should find myself at your feet. That day has arrived. And\r\nnow is there any other little cherished fact known to the police which\r\nyou would like to have imparted to you?"\r\n\r\nI took his humiliation seriously.\r\n\r\n"You are very good," I rejoined, "but I will not trouble you for any\r\n_facts_,--_those_ I am enabled to glean for myself; but what I should\r\nlike you to tell me is this: Whether if you came upon those rings in the\r\npossession of a person known to have been on the scene of crime at the\r\ntime of its perpetration, you would not consider them as an\r\nincontrovertible proof of guilt?"\r\n\r\n"Undoubtedly," said he, with a sudden alteration in his manner which\r\nwarned me that I must muster up all my strength if I would keep my\r\nsecret till I was quite ready to part with it.\r\n\r\n"Then," said I, with a resolute movement towards the door, "that\'s the\r\nwhole of my business for to-day. Good-morning, Mr. Gryce; to-morrow I\r\nshall expect you."\r\n\r\nHe made me stop though my foot had crossed the threshold; not by word or\r\nlook but simply by his fatherly manner.\r\n\r\n"Miss Butterworth," he observed, "the suspicions which you have\r\nentertained from the first have within the last few days assumed a\r\ndefinite form. In what direction do they point?--tell me."\r\n\r\nSome men and most women would have yielded to that imperative _tell me_!\r\nBut there was no yielding in Amelia Butterworth. Instead of that I\r\ntreated him to a touch of irony.\r\n\r\n"Is it possible," I asked, "that you think it worth while to consult\r\n_me_? I thought your eyes were too keen to seek assistance from mine.\r\nYou are as confident as I am that Howard Van Burnam is innocent of the\r\ncrime for which you have arrested him."\r\n\r\nA look that was dangerously insinuating crossed his face at this. He\r\ncame forward rapidly and, joining me where I stood, said smilingly:\r\n\r\n"Let us join forces, Miss Butterworth. You have from the first refused\r\nto consider the younger son of Silas Van Burnam as guilty. Your reasons\r\nthen were slight and hardly worth communicating. Have you any better\r\nones to advance now? It is not too late to mention them, if you have."\r\n\r\n"It will not be too late to-morrow," I retorted.\r\n\r\nConvinced that I was not to be moved from my position, he gave me one of\r\nhis low bows.\r\n\r\n"I forgot," said he, "that it was as a rival and not as a coadjutor you\r\nmeddled in this matter." And he bowed again, this time with a sarcastic\r\nair I felt too self-satisfied to resent.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow, then?" said I.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow."\r\n\r\nAt that I left him.\r\n\r\nI did not return immediately to Miss Althorpe. I visited Cox\'s millinery\r\nstore, Mrs. Desberger\'s house, and the offices of the various city\r\nrailways. But I got no clue to the rings; and finally satisfied that\r\nMiss Oliver, as I must now call her, had not lost or disposed of them on\r\nher way from Gramercy Park to her present place of refuge, I returned to\r\nMiss Althorpe\'s with even a greater determination than before to search\r\nthat luxurious home till I found them.\r\n\r\nBut a decided surprise awaited me. As the door opened I caught a\r\nglimpse of the butler\'s face, and noticing its embarrassed expression, I\r\nat once asked what had happened.\r\n\r\nHis answer showed a strange mixture of hesitation and bravado.\r\n\r\n"Not much, ma\'am; only Miss Althorpe is afraid you may not be pleased.\r\nMiss Oliver is gone, ma\'am; she ran away while Crescenze was out of the\r\nroom."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII.\r\n\r\nFOUND.\r\n\r\n\r\nI gave a low cry and rushed down the steps.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t go!" I called out to the driver. "I shall want you in ten\r\nminutes." And hurrying back, I ran up-stairs in a condition of mind such\r\nas I have no reason to be proud of. Happily Mr. Gryce was not there to\r\nsee me.\r\n\r\n"Gone? Miss Oliver gone?" I cried to the maid whom I found trembling in\r\na corner of the hall.\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am; it was my fault, ma\'am. She was in bed so quiet, I thought\r\nI might step out for a minute, but when I came back her clothes were\r\nmissing and she was gone. She must have slipped out at the front door\r\nwhile Dan was in the back hall. I don\'t see how ever she had the\r\nstrength to do it."\r\n\r\nNor did I. But I did not stop to reason about it; there was too much to\r\nbe done. Rushing on, I entered the room I had left in such high hopes a\r\nfew hours before. Emptiness was before me, and I realized what it was to\r\nbe baffled at the moment of success. But I did not waste an instant in\r\ninactivity. I searched the closets and pulled open the drawers; found\r\nher coat and hat gone, but not Mrs. Van Burnam\'s brown skirt, though the\r\npurse had been taken out of the pocket.\r\n\r\n"Is her bag here?" I asked.\r\n\r\nYes, it was in its old place under the table; and on the wash-stand and\r\nbureau were the simple toilet articles I had been told she had brought\r\nthere. In what haste she must have fled to leave these necessities\r\nbehind her!\r\n\r\nBut the greatest shock I received was the sight of the knitting-work,\r\nwith which I had so inconsiderately meddled the evening before, lying in\r\nravelled heaps on the table, as if torn to bits in a frenzy. This was a\r\nproof that the fever was yet on her; and as I contemplated this fact I\r\ntook courage, thinking that one in her condition would not be allowed to\r\nrun the streets long, but would be picked up and put in some hospital.\r\n\r\nIn this hope I began my search. Miss Althorpe, who came in just as I was\r\nabout to leave the house, consented to telephone to Police Headquarters\r\na description of the girl, with a request to be notified if such a\r\nperson should be found in the streets or on the docks or at any of the\r\nstation-houses that night. "Not," I assured her, as we left the\r\ntelephone and I prepared to say good-bye for the day, "that you need\r\nexpect her to be brought back to this house, for I do not mean that she\r\nshall ever darken your doors again. So let me know if they find her, and\r\nI will relieve you of all further responsibility in the matter."\r\n\r\nThen I started out.\r\n\r\nTo name the streets I traversed or the places I visited that day, would\r\ntake more space than I would like to devote to the subject. Dusk came,\r\nand I had failed in obtaining the least clue to her whereabouts; evening\r\nfollowed, and still no trace of the fugitive. What was I to do? Take Mr.\r\nGryce into my confidence after all? That would be galling to my pride,\r\nbut I began to fear I should have to submit to this humiliation when I\r\nhappened to think of the Chinaman. To think of him once was to think of\r\nhim twice, and to think of him twice was to be conscious of an\r\nirresistible desire to visit his place and find out if any one but\r\nmyself had been there to inquire after the lost one\'s clothes.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by Lena, I hurried away to Third Avenue. The laundry was\r\nnear Twenty-seventh Street. As we approached I grew troubled and\r\nunaccountably expectant. When we reached it I understood my excitement\r\nand instantly became calm. For there stood Miss Oliver, gazing like one\r\nunder a spell through the lighted window-panes into the narrow shop\r\nwhere the owner bent over his ironing. She had evidently stood there\r\nsome time, for a small group of half-grown lads were watching her with\r\nevery symptom of being about to break into a mischievous display of\r\ncuriosity. Her hands, which were without gloves, were pressed against\r\nthe glass, and her whole attitude showed an intensity of fatigue which\r\nwould have laid her on the ground had she not been sustained by an equal\r\nintensity of purpose.\r\n\r\nSending Lena for a carriage, I approached the poor creature and drew her\r\nforcibly from the window.\r\n\r\n"Do you want anything here?" I asked. "I will go in with you if you do."\r\n\r\nShe surveyed me with strange apathy, and yet with a certain sort of\r\nrelief too. Then she slowly shook her head.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything about it. My head swims and everything looks\r\nqueer, but some one or something sent me to this place."\r\n\r\n"Come in," I urged, "come in for a minute." And half supporting her,\r\nhalf dragging her, I managed to get her across the threshold and into\r\nthe Chinaman\'s shop.\r\n\r\nImmediately a dozen faces were pressed where hers had been.\r\n\r\nThe Chinaman, a stolid being, turned as he heard the little bell tinkle\r\nwhich announced a customer.\r\n\r\n"Is this the lady who left the clothes here a few nights ago?" I asked.\r\n\r\nHe stopped and stared, recognizing me slowly, and remembering by degrees\r\nwhat had passed between us at our last interview.\r\n\r\n"You tellee me lalee die; how him lalee when lalee die?"\r\n\r\n"The lady is not dead; I made a mistake. Is this the lady?"\r\n\r\n"Lalee talk; I no see face, I hear speak."\r\n\r\n"Have you seen this man before?" I inquired of my nearly insensible\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n"I think so in a dream," she murmured, trying to recall her poor\r\nwandering wits back from some region into which they had strayed.\r\n\r\n"Him lalee!" cried the Chinaman, overjoyed at the prospect of getting\r\nhis money. "Pletty speak, I knowee him. Lalee want clo?"\r\n\r\n"Not to-night. The lady is sick; see, she can hardly stand." And\r\noverjoyed at this seeming evidence that the police had failed to get\r\nwind of my interest in this place, I slipped a coin into the Chinaman\'s\r\nhand, and drew Miss Oliver away towards the carriage I now saw drawing\r\nup before the shop.\r\n\r\nLena\'s eyes when she came up to help me were a sight to see. They\r\nseemed to ask who this girl was and what I was going to do with her. I\r\nanswered the look by a very brief and evidently wholly unexpected\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n"This is your cousin who ran away," I remarked. "Don\'t you recognize\r\nher?"\r\n\r\nLena gave me up then and there; but she accepted my explanation, and\r\neven lied in her desire to carry out my whim.\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am," said she, "and glad I am to see her again." And with a\r\ndeft push here and a gentle pull there, she succeeded in getting the\r\nsick woman into the carriage.\r\n\r\nThe crowd, which had considerably increased by this time, was beginning\r\nto flock about us with shouts of no little derision. Escaping it as best\r\nI could, I took my seat by the poor girl\'s side, and bade Lena give the\r\norder for home. When we left the curb-stone behind, I felt that the last\r\npage in my adventures as an amateur detective had closed.\r\n\r\nBut I counted without my cost. Miss Oliver, who was in an advanced stage\r\nof fever, lay like a dead weight on my shoulder during the drive down\r\nthe avenue, but when we entered the Park and drew near my house, she\r\nbegan to show such signs of violent agitation that it was with\r\ndifficulty that the united efforts of Lena and myself could prevent her\r\nfrom throwing herself out of the carriage door which she had somehow\r\nmanaged to open.\r\n\r\nAs the carriage stopped she grew worse, and though she made no further\r\nefforts to leave it, I found her present impulses even harder to contend\r\nwith than the former. For now she would not be pushed out or dragged\r\nout, but crouched back moaning and struggling, her eyes fixed on the\r\nstoop, which is not unlike that of the adjoining house; till with a\r\nsudden realization that the cause of her terror lay in her fear of\r\nre-entering the scene of her late terrifying experiences, I bade the\r\ncoachman drive on, and reluctantly, I own, carried her back to the house\r\nshe had left in the morning.\r\n\r\nAnd this is how I came to spend a second night in Miss Althorpe\'s\r\nhospitable mansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII.\r\n\r\nTAKEN ABACK.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne incident more and this portion of my story is at an end. My poor\r\npatient, sicker than she had been the night before, left me but little\r\nleisure for thought or action disconnected with my care for her. But\r\ntowards morning she grew quieter, and finding in an open drawer those\r\ntangled threads of yarn of which I have spoken, I began to rewind them,\r\nout of a natural desire to see everything neat and orderly about me. I\r\nhad nearly finished my task when I heard a strange noise from the bed.\r\nIt was a sort of gurgling cry which I found hard to interpret, but which\r\nonly stopped when I laid my work down again. Manifestly this sick girl\r\nhad very nervous fancies.\r\n\r\nWhen I went down to breakfast the next morning, I was in that complacent\r\nstate of mind natural to a woman who feels that her abilities have\r\nasserted themselves and that she would soon receive a recognition of the\r\nsame at the hands of the one person for whose commendation she had\r\nchiefly been working. The identification of Miss Oliver by the Chinaman\r\nwas the last link in the chain connecting her with the Mrs. James Pope\r\nwho had accompanied Mr. Van Burnam to his father\'s house in Gramercy\r\nPark, and though I would fain have had the murdered woman\'s rings to\r\nshow, I was contented enough with the discoveries I had made to wish for\r\nthe hour which would bring me face to face with the detective.\r\n\r\nBut a surprise awaited me at the breakfast table in the shape of a\r\ncommunication from that gentleman. It had just been brought from my\r\nhouse by Lena, and it ran thus:\r\n\r\n     "DEAR MISS BUTTERWORTH:\r\n\r\n     "Pardon our interference. _We_ have found the rings which you\r\n     think so conclusive an evidence of guilt against the person\r\n     secreting them; and, _with your permission_ [this was basely\r\n     underlined], Mr. Franklin Van Burnam will be in custody to-day.\r\n\r\n     "I will wait upon you at ten.\r\n\r\n     "Respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n     "EBENEZAR GRYCE."\r\n\r\n_Franklin Van Burnam!_ Was I dreaming? _Franklin_ Van Burnam accused of\r\nthis crime and in custody! What did it mean? I had found no evidence\r\nagainst Franklin Van Burnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOOK III_.\r\n\r\nTHE GIRL IN GRAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX.\r\n\r\nAMELIA BECOMES PEREMPTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Madam, I hope I see you satisfied?"\r\n\r\nThis was Mr. Gryce\'s greeting as he entered my parlor on that memorable\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n"Satisfied?" I repeated, rising and facing him with what he afterwards\r\ndescribed as a stony glare.\r\n\r\n"Pardon me! I suppose you would have been still more satisfied if we had\r\nwaited for _you_ to point out the guilty man to _us_. But you must make\r\nsome allowances for professional egotism, Miss Butterworth. We really\r\ncould not allow you to take the initiatory step in a matter of such\r\nimportance."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" was my sole response; but he has since told me that there was a\r\ngreat deal in that _oh_; so much, that even he was startled by it.\r\n\r\n"You set to-day for a talk with me," he went on; "probably relying upon\r\nwhat you intended to assure yourself of yesterday. But our discovery at\r\nthe same time as yourself of the rings in Mr. Van Burnam\'s office, need\r\nnot interfere with your giving us your full confidence. The work you\r\nhave done has been excellent, and we are disposed to give you\r\nconsiderable credit for it."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\nI had no choice but to thus indulge in ejaculations. The communication\r\nhe had just made was so startling, and his assumption of my complete\r\nunderstanding of and participation in the discovery he professed to have\r\nmade, so puzzling, that I dared not venture beyond these simple\r\nexclamations, lest he should see the state of mind into which he had\r\nthrown me, and shut up like an oyster.\r\n\r\n"We have kept counsel over what we have found," the wary old detective\r\ncontinued, with a smile, which I wish I could imitate, but which\r\nunhappily belongs to him alone. "I hope that you, or your maid, I should\r\nsay, have been equally discreet."\r\n\r\nMy maid!\r\n\r\n"I see you are touched; but women find it so hard to keep a secret. But\r\nit does not matter. To-night the whole town will know that the older and\r\nnot the younger brother has had these rings in his keeping."\r\n\r\n"It will be nuts for the papers," I commented; then making an effort, I\r\nremarked: "You are a most judicious man, Mr. Gryce, and must have other\r\nreasons than the discovery of these rings for your threatened arrest of\r\na man of such excellent repute as Silas Van Burnam\'s eldest son. I\r\nshould like to hear them, Mr. Gryce. I should like to hear them very\r\nmuch."\r\n\r\nMy attempt to seem at ease under these embarrassing conditions must have\r\ngiven a certain sharpness to my tone; for, instead of replying, he\r\nremarked, with well simulated concern and a fatherly humoring of my\r\nfolly peculiarly exasperating to one of my temperament: "You are\r\ndispleased, Miss Butterworth, because we did not let _you_ find the\r\nrings."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps; but we were engaged in an open field. I could not expect the\r\npolice to stand aside for me."\r\n\r\n"Exactly! Especially when you have the secret satisfaction of having put\r\nthe police on the track of these jewels."\r\n\r\n"How?"\r\n\r\n"We were simply fortunate in laying our hands on them first. You, or\r\nyour maid rather, showed us where to look for them."\r\n\r\nLena again.\r\n\r\nI was so dumfounded by this last assertion, I did not attempt to reply.\r\nFortunately, he misinterpreted my silence and the "stony glare" with\r\nwhich it was accompanied.\r\n\r\n"I know that it must seem to you altogether too bad, to be tripped up at\r\nthe moment of your anticipated triumph. But if apologies will suffice to\r\nexpress our sense of presumption, then I pray you to accept them, Miss\r\nButterworth, both on my own part and on that of the Superintendent of\r\nPolice."\r\n\r\nI did not understand in the least what he was talking about, but I\r\nrecognized the sarcasm of his final expression, and had spirit enough to\r\nreply:\r\n\r\n"The subject is too important for any more nonsense. Whereabouts in\r\nFranklin Van Burnam\'s desk were these rings found, and how do you know\r\nthat his brother did not put them there?"\r\n\r\n"Your ignorance is refreshing, Miss Butterworth. If you will ask a\r\ncertain young girl dressed in gray, upon what object connected with Mr.\r\nVan Burnam\'s desk she laid her hands yesterday morning, you will have\r\nan answer to your first question. The second one is still more easily\r\nanswered. Mr. Howard Van Burnam did not conceal the rings in the Duane\r\nStreet office for the reason that he has not been in that office since\r\nhis wife was killed. Regarding this fact we are as well advised as\r\nyourself. Now you change color, Miss Butterworth. But there is no\r\nnecessity. For an amateur you have made less trouble and fewer mistakes\r\nthan were to be expected."\r\n\r\nWorse and worse! He was patronizing me now, and for results I had done\r\nnothing to bring about. I surveyed him in absolute amazement. Was he\r\namusing himself with me, or was he himself deceived as to the nature and\r\ntrend of my late investigations. This was a question to settle, and at\r\nonce; and as duplicity had hitherto proved my best weapon in dealing\r\nwith Mr. Gryce, I concluded to resort to it in this emergency. Clearing\r\nmy brow, I regarded with a more amenable air the little Hungarian vase\r\nhe had taken up on entering the room, and into which he had been talking\r\never since he thought it worth while to compliment its owner.\r\n\r\n"I do not wish," said I, "to be published to the world as the discoverer\r\nof Franklin Van Burnam\'s guilt. But I do want credit with the police, if\r\nonly because one of their number has chosen to look upon my efforts with\r\ndisdain. I mean you, Mr. Gryce; so, if you are in earnest"--he smiled at\r\nthe vase most genially--"I will accept your apologies just so far as you\r\nhonor me with your confidence. I know you are anxious to hear what\r\nevidence I have collected, or you would not be wasting time on me this\r\nbusy morning."\r\n\r\n"Shrewd!" was the short ejaculation he shot into the mouth of the vase\r\nhe was handling.\r\n\r\n"If that term of admiration is intended for me," I remarked, "I am sure\r\nI am only too sensible of the honor. But flattery has never succeeded in\r\nmaking me talk against my better judgment. I may be shrewd, but a fool\r\ncould see what you are after this morning. Compliment me when I have\r\ndeserved it. I can wait."\r\n\r\n"I begin to think that what you withhold so resolutely has more than\r\ncommon value, Miss Butterworth. If this is so, I must not be the only\r\none to listen to your explanations. Is not that a carriage I hear\r\nstopping? I am expecting Inspector Z----. If that is he you have been\r\nwise to delay your communications till he came."\r\n\r\nA carriage _was_ stopping, and it was the Inspector who alighted from\r\nit. I began to feel my importance in a way that was truly gratifying,\r\nand cast my eyes up at the portrait of my father with a secret longing\r\nthat its original stood by to witness the verification of his prophecy.\r\n\r\nBut I was not so distracted by these thoughts as not to make one attempt\r\nto get something from Mr. Gryce before the Inspector joined us.\r\n\r\n"Why do you speak to me of my maid in one breath and of a girl in gray\r\nin another? Did you think Lena----"\r\n\r\n"Hush!" he enjoined, "we will have ample opportunities to discuss this\r\nsubject later."\r\n\r\n"Will we?" thought I. "We will discuss nothing till I know more\r\npositively what you are aiming at."\r\n\r\nBut I showed nothing of this determination in my face. On the contrary,\r\nI became all affability as the Inspector entered, and I did the honors\r\nof the house in a way I hope my father would have approved of, had he\r\nbeen alive and present.\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce continued to stare into the vase.\r\n\r\n"Miss Butterworth,"--it was the Inspector who was speaking,--"I have\r\nbeen told that you take great interest in the Van Burnam murder, and\r\nthat you have even gone so far as to collect some facts in connection\r\nwith it which you have not as yet given to the police."\r\n\r\n"You have heard correctly," I returned. "I have taken a deep interest in\r\nthis tragedy, and have come into possession of some facts in reference\r\nto it which as yet I have imparted to no living soul."\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce\'s interest in my poor little vase increased marvellously.\r\nSeeing this, I complacently continued:\r\n\r\n"I could not have accomplished so much had I indulged in a confidant.\r\nSuch work as I have attempted depends for its success upon the secrecy\r\nwith which it is carried on. That is why amateur work is sometimes more\r\neffective than professional. No one suspected me of making inquiries,\r\nunless it was this gentleman, and he was forewarned of my possible\r\ninterference. I told him that in case Howard Van Burnam was put under\r\narrest, I should take it upon myself to stir up matters; and I have."\r\n\r\n"Then you do not believe in Mr. Van Burnam\'s guilt? Not even in his\r\ncomplicity, I suppose?" ventured the Inspector.\r\n\r\n"I do not know anything about his complicity; but I do not believe the\r\nstroke given to his wife came from his hand."\r\n\r\n"I see, I see. You believe it the work of his brother."\r\n\r\nI stole a look at Mr. Gryce before replying. He had turned the vase\r\nupside down, and was intently studying its label; but he could not\r\nconceal his expectation of an affirmative answer. Greatly relieved, I\r\nimmediately took the position I had resolved upon, and calmly but\r\nvigorously observed:\r\n\r\n"What I believe, and what I have learned in support of my belief, will\r\nsound as well in your ears ten minutes hence as now. Before I give you\r\nthe result of such inquiries as I have been enabled to make, I require\r\nto know what evidence you have yourself collected against the gentleman\r\nyou have just named, and in what respect it is as criminating as that\r\nagainst his brother?"\r\n\r\n"Is not that peremptory, Miss Butterworth? And do you think us called\r\nupon to part with all or any of the secrets of our office? We have\r\ninformed you that we have new and startling evidence against the older\r\nbrother; should not that be sufficient for you?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps so if I were an assistant of yours, or even in your employ. But\r\nI am neither; I stand alone, and although I am a woman and unused to\r\nthis business, I have earned, as I think you will acknowledge later, the\r\nright to some consideration on your part. I cannot present the facts I\r\nhave to relate in a proper manner till I know just how the case stands."\r\n\r\n"It is not curiosity that troubles Miss Butterworth--Madam, I said it\r\nwas not curiosity--but a laudable desire to have the whole matter\r\narranged with precision," dropped now in his dryest tones from the\r\ndetective\'s lips.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Gryce has a most excellent understanding of my character," I\r\ngravely observed.\r\n\r\nThe Inspector looked nonplussed. He glanced at Mr. Gryce and he glanced\r\nat me, but the smile of the former was inscrutable, and my expression,\r\nif I showed any, must have betrayed but little relenting.\r\n\r\n"If called as a witness, Miss Butterworth,"--this was how he sought to\r\nmanage me,--"you will have no choice in the matter. You will be\r\ncompelled to speak or show contempt of court."\r\n\r\n"That is true," I acknowledged. "But it is not what I might feel myself\r\ncalled upon to say then, but what I can say now, that is of interest to\r\nyou at this present moment. So be generous, gentlemen, and satisfy my\r\ncuriosity, for such Mr. Gryce considers it, in spite of his assertions\r\nto the contrary. Will it not all come out in the papers a few hours\r\nhence, and have I not earned as much at your hands as the reporters?"\r\n\r\n"The reporters are our bane. Do not liken yourself to the reporters."\r\n\r\n"Yet they sometimes give you a valuable clue."\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce looked as if he would like to disclaim this, but he was a\r\njudicious soul, and merely gave a twist to the vase which I thought\r\nwould cost me that small article of vertu.\r\n\r\n"Shall we humor Miss Butterworth?" asked the Inspector.\r\n\r\n"We will do better," answered Mr. Gryce, setting the vase down with a\r\nprecision that made me jump; for I am a worshipper of _bric-\xe0-brac_, and\r\nprize the few articles I own, possibly beyond their real value. "We will\r\ntreat her as a coadjutor, which, by the way, she says she is not, and by\r\nthe trust we place in her, secure that discretionary use of our\r\nconfidence which she shows with so much spirit in regard to her own."\r\n\r\n"Begin then," said I.\r\n\r\n"I will," said he, "but first allow me to acknowledge that you are the\r\nperson who first put us on the track of Franklin Van Burnam."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX.\r\n\r\nTHE MATTER AS STATED BY MR. GRYCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had exhausted my wonder, so I accepted this statement with no more\r\ndisplay of surprise than a grim smile.\r\n\r\n"When you failed to identify Howard Van Burnam as the man who\r\naccompanied his wife into the adjacent house, I realized that I must\r\nlook elsewhere for the murderer of Louise Van Burnam. You see I had more\r\nconfidence in the excellence of your memory than you had yourself, so\r\nmuch indeed that I gave you more than one chance to exercise it, having,\r\nby certain little methods I sometimes employ, induced different moods in\r\nMr. Van Burnam at the time of his several visits, so that his bearing\r\nmight vary, and you have every opportunity to recognize him for the man\r\nyou had seen on that fatal night."\r\n\r\n"Then it was he you brought here each time?" I broke in.\r\n\r\n"It was he."\r\n\r\n"Well!" I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n"The Superintendent and some others whom I need not mention,"--here Mr.\r\nGryce took up another small object from the table,--"believed implicitly\r\nin his guilt; conjugal murder is so common and the causes which lead to\r\nit so frequently puerile. Therefore I had to work alone. But this did\r\nnot cause me any concern. _Your_ doubts emphasized mine, and when you\r\nconfided to me that you had seen a figure similar to the one we were\r\ntrying to identify, enter the adjoining house on the evening of the\r\nfuneral, I made immediate inquiries and discovered that the gentleman\r\nwho had entered the house right after the four persons described by you\r\nwas _Franklin Van Burnam_. This gave me a definite clue, and this is why\r\nI say that it was you who gave me my first start in this matter."\r\n\r\n"Humph!" thought I to myself, as with a sudden shock I remembered that\r\none of the words which had fallen from Miss Oliver\'s lips during her\r\ndelirium had been this very name of Franklin.\r\n\r\n"I had had my doubts of this gentleman before," continued the detective,\r\nwarming gradually with his subject. "A man of my experience doubts every\r\none in a case of this kind, and I had formed at odd times a sort of side\r\ntheory, so to speak, into which some little matters which came up during\r\nthe inquest seemed to fit with more or less nicety; but I had no real\r\njustification for suspicion till the event of which I speak. That you\r\nhad evidently formed the same theory as myself and were bound to enter\r\ninto the lists with me, put me on my mettle, madam, and with your\r\nknowledge or without it, the struggle between us began."\r\n\r\n"So your disdain of me," I here put in with a triumphant air I could not\r\nsubdue, "was only simulated? I shall know what to think of you\r\nhereafter. But don\'t stop, go on, this is all deeply interesting to me."\r\n\r\n"I can understand that. To proceed then; my first duty, of course, was\r\nto watch _you_. You had reasons of your own for suspecting this man, so\r\nby watching you I hoped to surprise them."\r\n\r\n"Good!" I cried, unable to entirely conceal the astonishment and grim\r\namusement into which his continued misconception of the trend of my\r\nsuspicions threw me.\r\n\r\n"But you led us a chase, madam; I must acknowledge that you led us a\r\nchase. Your being an amateur led me to anticipate your using an\r\namateur\'s methods, but you showed skill, madam, and the man I sent to\r\nkeep watch over Mrs. Boppert against your looked-for visit there, was\r\nfoiled by the very simple strategy you used in meeting her at a\r\nneighboring shop."\r\n\r\n"Good!" I again cried, in my relief that the discovery made at that\r\nmeeting had not been shared by him.\r\n\r\n"We had sounded Mrs. Boppert ourselves, but she had seemed a very\r\nhopeless job, and I do not yet see how you got any water out of that\r\nstone--if you did."\r\n\r\n"No?" I retorted ambiguously, enjoying the Inspector\'s manifest delight\r\nin this scene as much as I did my own secret thoughts and the prospect\r\nof the surprise I was holding in store for them.\r\n\r\n"But your interference with the clock and the discovery you made that it\r\nhad been going at the time the shelves fell, was not unknown to us, and\r\nwe have made use of it, good use as you will hereafter see."\r\n\r\n"So! those girls could not keep a secret after all," I muttered; and\r\nwaited with some anxiety to hear him mention the pin-cushion; but he did\r\nnot, greatly to my relief.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t blame the girls!" he put in (his ears evidently are as sharp as\r\nmine); "the inquiries having proceeded from Franklin, it was only\r\nnatural for me to suspect that he was trying to mislead us by some\r\nhocus-pocus story. So _I_ visited the girls. That I had difficulty in\r\ngetting to the root of the matter is to their credit, Miss Butterworth,\r\nseeing that you had made them promise secrecy."\r\n\r\n"You are right," I nodded, and forgave them on the spot. If I could not\r\nwithstand Mr. Gryce\'s eloquence--and it affected me at times--how could\r\nI expect these girls to. Besides, they had not revealed the more\r\nimportant secret I had confided to them, and in consideration of this I\r\nwas ready to pardon them most anything.\r\n\r\n"That the clock was going at the time the shelves fell, and that he\r\nshould be the one to draw our attention to it would seem to the\r\nsuperficial mind proof positive that he was innocent of the deed with\r\nwhich it was so closely associated," the detective proceeded. "But to\r\none skilled in the subterfuges of criminals, this seemingly conclusive\r\nfact in his favor was capable of an explanation so in keeping with the\r\nsubtlety shown in every other feature of this remarkable crime, that I\r\nbegan to regard it as a point against him rather than in his favor. Of\r\nwhich more hereafter.\r\n\r\n"Not allowing myself to be deterred, then, by this momentary set-back,\r\nand rejoicing in an affair considered as settled by my superiors, I\r\nproceeded to establish Franklin Van Burnam\'s connection with the crime\r\nwhich had been laid with so much apparent reason at his brother\'s door.\r\n\r\n"The first fact to be settled was, of course, whether your\r\nidentification of him as the gentleman who accompanied his victim into\r\nMr. Van Burnam\'s house could be corroborated by any of the many persons\r\nwho had seen the so-called Mr. James Pope at the Hotel D----.\r\n\r\n"As none of the witnesses who attended the inquest had presumed to\r\nrecognize in either of these sleek and haughty gentlemen the shrinking\r\nperson just mentioned, I knew that any open attempt on my part to bring\r\nabout an identification would result disastrously. So I employed\r\nstrategy--like my betters, Miss Butterworth" (here his bow was\r\noverpowering in its mock humility); "and rightly considering that for a\r\nperson to be satisfactorily identified with another, he must be seen\r\nunder the same circumstances and in nearly the same place, I sought out\r\nFranklin Van Burnam, and with specious promises of some great benefit to\r\nbe done his brother, induced him to accompany me to the Hotel D----.\r\n\r\n"Whether he saw through my plans and thought that a brave front and an\r\nassumption of candor would best serve him in this unexpected dilemma, or\r\nwhether he felt so entrenched behind the precautions he had taken as not\r\nto fear discovery under any circumstances, he made but one demur before\r\npreparing to accompany me. This demur was significant, however, for it\r\nwas occasioned by my advice to change his dress for one less\r\nconspicuously fashionable, or to hide it under an ulster or mackintosh.\r\nAnd as a proof of his hardihood--remember, madam, that his connection\r\nwith this crime has been established--he actually did put on the ulster,\r\nthough he must have known what a difference it would make in his\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n"The result was all I could desire. As we entered the hotel, I saw a\r\ncertain hackman start and lean forward to look after him. It was the one\r\nwho had driven Mr. and Mrs. Pope away from the hotel. And when we passed\r\nthe porter, the wink which I gave him was met by a lift of his eyelids\r\nwhich he afterwards interpreted into \'Like! very like!\'\r\n\r\n"But it was from the clerk I received the most unequivocal proof of his\r\nidentity. On entering the office I had left Mr. Van Burnam as near as\r\npossible to the spot where Mr. Pope had stood while his so-called wife\r\nwas inscribing their names in the register, and bidding him to remain in\r\nthe background while I had a few words at the desk, all in his brother\'s\r\ninterests of course, I succeeded in secretly directing Mr. Henshaw\'s\r\nattention towards him. The start which he gave and the exclamation he\r\nuttered were unequivocal. \'Why, there\'s the man now!\' he cried, happily\r\nin a whisper. \'Anxious look, drooping head, brown moustache, everything\r\nbut the duster.\' \'Bah!\' said I; \'that\'s Mr. _Franklin_ Van Burnam you\r\nare looking at! What are you thinking of?\' \'Can\'t help it,\' said he; \'I\r\nsaw both of the brothers at the inquest, and saw nothing in them then to\r\nremind me of our late mysterious guest. But as he stands there, he\'s a\r\n---- sight more like James Pope than the other one is, and don\'t you\r\nforget it.\' I shrugged my shoulders, told him he was a fool, and that\r\nfools had better keep their follies to themselves, and came away with my\r\nman, outwardly disgusted but inwardly in most excellent trim for\r\npursuing an investigation which had opened so auspiciously.\r\n\r\n"Whether this man possessed any motive for a crime so seemingly out of\r\naccordance with his life and disposition was, of course, the next point\r\nto settle. His conduct at the inquest certainly showed no decided\r\nanimosity toward his brother\'s wife, nor was there on the surface of\r\naffairs any token of the mortal hatred which alone could account for a\r\ncrime at once so deliberate and so brutal. But we detectives plunge\r\nbelow the surface, and after settling the question of Franklin\'s\r\nidentity with the so-called Mr. Pope of the Hotel D----, I left New York\r\nand its interests--among which I reckoned your efforts at detective\r\nwork, Miss Butterworth--to a young man in my office, who, I am afraid,\r\ndid not quite understand the persistence of your character; for he had\r\nnothing to tell me concerning you on my return, save that you had been\r\ncultivating Miss Althorpe, which, of course, was such a natural thing\r\nfor you to do, I wonder he thought it necessary to mention it.\r\n\r\n"My destination was Four Corners, the place where Howard first met his\r\nfuture wife. In relating what I learned there, I shall doubtless repeat\r\nfacts with which you are acquainted, Miss Butterworth."\r\n\r\n"That is of no consequence," I returned, with almost brazen duplicity;\r\nfor I not only was ignorant of what he was going to say, but had every\r\nreason to believe that it would bear as remote a connection as possible\r\nto the secret then laboring in my breast. "A statement of the case from\r\nyour lips," I pursued, "will emphasize what I know. Do not stint any of\r\nyour disclosures, then, I beg. I have an ear for all." This was truer\r\nthan my rather sarcastic tone would convey, for might not his story\r\nafter all prove to have some unexpected relation with the facts I had\r\nmyself gathered together.\r\n\r\n"It is a pleasure," said he, "to think I am capable of giving any\r\ninformation to Miss Butterworth, and as I did not run across you or your\r\nvery nimble and pert little maid during my stay at Four Corners, I shall\r\ntake it for granted that you confined your inquiries to the city and the\r\nsociety of which you are such a shining light."\r\n\r\nThis in reference to my double visit at Miss Althorpe\'s, no doubt.\r\n\r\n"Four Corners is a charming town in Southern Vermont, and here, three\r\nyears ago, Howard Van Burnam first met Miss Stapleton. She was living in\r\na gentleman\'s family at that time as travelling companion to his invalid\r\ndaughter."\r\n\r\nAh, now I could see what explanation this wary old detective gave\r\nhimself of my visits to Miss Althorpe, and began to hug myself in\r\nanticipation of my coming triumph over him.\r\n\r\n"The place did not fit her, for Miss Stapleton only shone in the society\r\nof men; but Mr. Harrison had not yet discovered this special\r\nidiosyncrasy of hers, and as his daughter was able to see a few friends,\r\nand in fact needed some diversion, the way was open to her companion for\r\nthat acquaintance with Mr. Van Burnam which has led to such disastrous\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n"The house at which their meeting took place was a private one, and I\r\nsoon found out many facts not widely known in this city. First, that she\r\nwas not so much in love with Howard as he was with her. _He_ succumbed\r\nto her fascinations at once, and proposed, I believe, within two weeks\r\nafter seeing her; but though she accepted him, few of those who saw them\r\ntogether thought her affections very much engaged till Franklin suddenly\r\nappeared in town, when her whole manner underwent a change, and she\r\nbecame so sparklingly and irresistibly beautiful that her avowed lover\r\nbecame doubly enslaved, and Franklin--Well, there is evidence to prove\r\nthat he was not insensible to her charms either; that, in spite of her\r\nengagement to his brother and the attitude which honor bade him hold\r\ntowards his prospective sister-in-law, he lost his head for a short\r\ntime at least, and under her seductions I do not doubt, for she was a\r\ndouble-faced woman according to general repute, went so far as to\r\nexpress his passion in a letter of which I heard much before I was so\r\nfortunate as to obtain a sight of it. This was three years ago, and I\r\nthink Miss Stapleton would have been willing to have broken with Howard\r\nand married Franklin if the latter had had the courage to meet his\r\nbrother\'s reproaches. But he evidently was deficient in this quality.\r\nHis very letter, which is a warm one, but which holds out no hope to her\r\nof any closer bond between them than that offered by her prospective\r\nunion with his brother, shows that he still retained some sense of\r\nhonor, and as he presently left Four Corners and did not appear again\r\nwhere they were till just before their marriage, it is probable that all\r\nwould have gone well if the woman had shared this sentiment with him.\r\nBut she was made up of mean materials, and while willing to marry Howard\r\nfor what he could give her or what she thought he could give her, she\r\nyet cherished an implacable grudge against Franklin for his weakness, as\r\nshe called it, in not following the dictates of his heart. Being sly as\r\nwell as passionate, she hid her feelings from every one but a venial,\r\nthough apparently devoted confidante, a young girl named----"\r\n\r\n"Oliver," I finished in my own mind.\r\n\r\nBut the name he mentioned was quite different.\r\n\r\n"Pigot," he said, looking at the filigree basket he held in his hand as\r\nif he picked this word out from one of its many interstices. "She was\r\nFrench, and after once finding her, I had but little difficulty in\r\nlearning all she had to tell. She had been Miss Harrison\'s maid, but\r\nshe was not above serving Miss Stapleton in many secret and dishonorable\r\nways. As a consequence, she could give me the details of an interview\r\nwhich that lady had held with Franklin Van Burnam on the evening of her\r\nwedding. It took place in Mr. Harrison\'s garden, and was supposed to be\r\na secret one, but the woman who arranged the meeting was not the person\r\nto keep away from it when it occurred, and consequently I have been\r\nenabled to learn with more or less accuracy what took place between\r\nthem. It was not to Miss Stapleton\'s credit. Mr. Van Burnam merely\r\nwanted his letter back, but she refused to return it unless he would\r\npromise her a complete recognition by his family of her marriage and\r\nensure her a reception in his father\'s house as Howard\'s wife. This was\r\nmore than he could engage himself to perform. He had already, according\r\nto his own story, made every effort possible to influence the old\r\ngentleman in her favor, but had only succeeded in irritating him against\r\nhimself. It was an acknowledgment which would have satisfied most women,\r\nbut it did not satisfy her. She declared her intention of keeping the\r\nletter for fear he would cease his exertions; and heedless of the effect\r\nproduced upon him by the barefaced threat, proceeded to inveigh against\r\nhis brother for the very love which made her union with him possible;\r\nand as if this was not bad enough, showed at the same time such a\r\ndisposition to profit by whatever worldly good the match promised, that\r\nFranklin lost all regard for her, and began to hate her.\r\n\r\n"As he made no effort to conceal his feelings, she must have become\r\nimmediately aware of the change which had taken place in them. But\r\nhowever affected by this, she gave no sign of relenting in her purpose.\r\nOn the contrary, she persisted in her determination to retain his\r\nletter, and when he remonstrated with her and threatened to leave town\r\nbefore her marriage, she retorted by saying that, if he did so, she\r\nwould show his letter to his brother as soon as the minister had made\r\nthem one. This threat seemed to affect Franklin deeply, and while it\r\nintensified his feeling of animosity towards her, subjected him for the\r\nmoment to her whim. He stayed in Four Corners till the ceremony was\r\nperformed, but was such a gloomy guest that all united in saying that he\r\ndid the occasion no credit.\r\n\r\n"So much for my work in Four Corners."\r\n\r\nI had by this time become aware that Mr. Gryce was addressing himself\r\nchiefly to the Inspector, being gratified no doubt at this opportunity\r\nof presenting his case at length before that gentleman. But true to his\r\nspecial habits, he looked at neither of us, but rather at the fretted\r\nbasket, upon the handle of which he tapped out his arguments as he\r\nquickly proceeded:\r\n\r\n"The young couple spent the first months of their married life in\r\nYonkers; so to Yonkers I went next. There I learned that Franklin had\r\nvisited the place twice; both times, as I judge, upon a peremptory\r\nsummons from her. The result was mutual fret and heartburning, for she\r\nhad made no progress in her endeavors to win recognition from the Van\r\nBurnams; and even had had occasion to perceive that her husband\'s love,\r\nbased as it was upon her physical attributes, had begun to feel the\r\nstress of her uneasiness and dissatisfaction. She became more anxious\r\nthan ever for social recognition and distinction, and when the family\r\nwent to Europe, consented to accompany her husband into the quiet\r\nretreat he thought best calculated to win the approbation of his father,\r\nonly upon the assurance of better times in the fall and a possible visit\r\nto Washington in the winter. But the quiet to which she was subjected\r\nhad a bad effect upon her. Under it she grew more and more restless, and\r\nas the time approached for the family\'s return, conceived so many plans\r\nfor conciliating them that her husband could not restrain his disgust.\r\nBut the worst plan of all and the one which undoubtedly led to her\r\ndeath, he never knew. This was to surprise Franklin at his office and,\r\nby renewed threats of showing this old love-letter to his brother, win\r\nan absolute promise from him to support her in a fresh endeavor to win\r\nhis father\'s favor. You see she did not understand Silas Van Burnam\'s\r\nreal character, and persisted in holding the most extravagant views\r\nconcerning Franklin\'s ascendancy over him as well as over the rest of\r\nthe family. She even went so far as to insist in the interview, which\r\nJane Pigot overheard, that it was Franklin himself who stood in the way\r\nof her desires, and that if he chose he could obtain for her an\r\ninvitation to take up her abode with the rest of them in Gramercy Park.\r\nTo Duane Street she therefore went before making her appearance at Mrs.\r\nParker\'s; a fact which was not brought out at the inquest; Franklin not\r\ndisclosing it of course, and the clerk not recognizing her under the\r\nfalse name she chose to give. Of the details of this interview I am\r\nignorant, but as she was closeted with him some time, it is only natural\r\nto suppose that conversation of some importance took place between them.\r\nThe clerk who works in the outer office did not, as I have said, know\r\nwho she was at the time, but he noticed her face when she came out, and\r\nhe declares that it was insolent with triumph, while Mr. Franklin, who\r\nwas polite enough or calculating enough to bow her out of the room, was\r\npale with rage, and acted so unlike himself that everybody observed it.\r\nShe held his letter in her hand, a letter easily distinguishable by the\r\nviolet-colored seal on the back, and she filliped with it in a most\r\naggravating way as she crossed the floor, pretending to lay it down on\r\nHoward\'s desk as she went by and then taking it up again with an arch\r\nlook at Franklin, pretty enough to see but hateful in its effect on him.\r\nAs he went back to his own room his face was full of anger, and such was\r\nthe effect of this visit on him that he declined to see any one else\r\nthat day. She had probably shown such determination to reveal his past\r\nperfidy to her husband, that his fears were fully aroused at last, and\r\nhe saw he was not only likely to lose his good name but the esteem with\r\nwhich he was accustomed to be regarded by this younger and evidently\r\nmuch-loved brother.\r\n\r\n"And now, considering his intense pride, as well as his affection for\r\nHoward, do you not see the motive which this seemingly good man had for\r\nputting his troublesome sister-in-law out of existence? He wanted that\r\nletter back, and to obtain it had to resort to crime. Or such is my\r\npresent theory of this murder, Miss Butterworth. Does it correspond with\r\nyours?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI.\r\n\r\nSOME FINE WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n"O perfectly!" I assented, with just the shade of irony necessary to rob\r\nthe assertion of its mendacity. "But go on, go on. You have not begun to\r\nsatisfy me yet. You did not stop with finding a motive for the crime I\r\nam sure."\r\n\r\n"Madam, you are a female Shylock; you will have the whole of the bond or\r\nnone."\r\n\r\n"We are not here to draw comparisons," I retorted. "Keep to the subject,\r\nMr. Gryce; keep to the subject."\r\n\r\nHe laughed; laid down the little basket he held, took it up again, and\r\nfinally resumed:\r\n\r\n"Madam, you are right; we did not stop at finding a motive. Our next\r\nstep was to collect evidence directly connecting him with the crime."\r\n\r\n"And you succeeded in this?"\r\n\r\nMy tone was unnecessarily eager, this was all so unaccountable to me;\r\nbut he did not appear to notice it.\r\n\r\n"We did. Indeed the evidence against him is stronger than that against\r\nhis brother. For if we ignore the latter part of Howard\'s testimony,\r\nwhich was evidently a tissue of lies, what remains against him? Three\r\nthings: his dogged persistency in not recognizing his wife in the\r\nmurdered woman; the receiving of the house keys from his brother; and\r\nthe fact that he was seen on the stoop of his father\'s house at an\r\nunusual hour in the morning following this murder. Now what have we\r\nagainst Franklin? Many things.\r\n\r\n"First:\r\n\r\n"That he can no more account for the hours between half-past eleven on\r\nTuesday morning and five o\'clock on the following Wednesday morning than\r\nhis brother can. In one breath he declares that he was shut up in his\r\nrooms at the hotel, for which no corroborative evidence is forthcoming;\r\nand in another that he was on a tramp after his brother, which seems\r\nequally improbable and incapable of proof.\r\n\r\n"Second:\r\n\r\n"That he and not Howard was the man in a linen duster, and that he and\r\nnot Howard was in possession of the keys that night. As these are\r\nserious statements to make, I will give you my reasons for them. They\r\nare distinct from the recognition of his person by the inmates of the\r\nHotel D----, and added to that recognition, form a strong case against\r\nhim. The janitor who has charge of the offices in Duane Street,\r\nhappening to have a leisure moment on the morning of the day on which\r\nMrs. Van Burnam was murdered, was making the most of it by watching the\r\nunloading of a huge boiler some four doors below the Van Burnam\r\nwarehouse. He was consequently looking intently in that direction when\r\nHoward passed him, coming from the interview with his brother in which\r\nhe had been given the keys. Mr. Van Burnam was walking briskly, but\r\nfinding the sidewalk blocked by the boiler to which I have alluded,\r\npaused for a moment to let it pass, and being greatly heated, took out\r\nhis handkerchief to wipe his forehead. This done, he moved on, just as a\r\nman dressed in a long duster came up behind him, stopping where he\r\nstopped and picking up from the ground something which the first\r\ngentleman had evidently dropped. This last man\'s figure looked more or\r\nless familiar to the janitor, so did the duster, and later he discovered\r\nthat the latter was the one which he had seen hanging for so long a time\r\nin the little disused closet under the warehouse stairs. Its wearer was\r\nFranklin Van Burnam, who, as I took pains to learn, had left the office\r\nimmediately in the wake of his brother, and the object he picked up was\r\nthe bunch of keys which the latter had inadvertently dropped. He may\r\nhave thought he lost them later, but it was then and there they slipped\r\nfrom his pocket. I will here add that the duster found by the hackman in\r\nhis coach has been identified as the one missing from the closet just\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n"Third:\r\n\r\n"The keys with which Mr. Van Burnam\'s house was unlocked were found\r\nhanging in their usual place by noon of the next day. They could not\r\nhave been taken there by Howard, for he was not seen at the office after\r\nthe murder. By whom then were they returned, if not by Franklin?\r\n\r\n"Fourth:\r\n\r\n"The letter, for the possession of which I believe this crime to have\r\nbeen perpetrated, was found by us in a supposedly secret drawer of this\r\ngentleman\'s desk. It was much crumpled, and bore evidences of having\r\nbeen rather rudely dealt with since it was last seen in Mrs. Van\r\nBurnam\'s hand in that very office.\r\n\r\n"But the fact which is most convincing, and which will tell most heavily\r\nagainst him, is the unexpected discovery of the murdered lady\'s rings,\r\nalso in this same desk. How _you_ became aware that anything of such\r\nimportance could be found there, knowing even the exact place in which\r\nthey were secreted, I will not stop to ask at this moment. Enough that\r\nwhen your maid entered the Van Burnam offices and insisted with so much\r\ningenuousness that she was expected by Mr. Van Burnam and would wait for\r\nhis return, the clerk most devoted to my interests became distrustful of\r\nher intentions, having been told to be on the look-out for a girl in\r\ngray or a lady in black with puffs on each side of two very sharp eyes.\r\nYou will pardon me, Miss Butterworth. He therefore kept his eyes on the\r\ngirl and presently espied her stretching out her hand towards a hook at\r\nthe side of Mr. Franklin Van Burnam\'s desk. As it is upon this hook this\r\ngentleman strings his unanswered letters, the clerk rose from his place\r\nas quickly as possible, and coming forward with every appearance of\r\npolite solicitude,--did she not say he was polite, Miss\r\nButterworth?--inquired what she wished, thinking she was after some\r\nletter, or possibly anxious for a specimen of some one\'s handwriting.\r\nBut she gave him no other reply than a blush and a confused look, for\r\nwhich you must rebuke her, Miss Butterworth, if you are going to\r\ncontinue to employ her as your agent in these very delicate affairs. And\r\nshe made another mistake. She should not have left so abruptly upon\r\ndetection, for that gave the clerk an opportunity to telephone for me,\r\nwhich he immediately did. I was at liberty, and I came at once, and,\r\nafter hearing his story, decided that what was of interest to you must\r\nbe of interest to me, and so took a look at the letters she had handled,\r\nand discovered, what she also must have discovered before she let them\r\nslip from her hand, that the five missing rings we were all in search of\r\nwere hanging on this same hook amid the sheets of Franklin\'s\r\ncorrespondence. You can imagine, madam, my satisfaction, and the\r\ngratitude which I felt towards my agent, who by his quickness had\r\nretained to me the honors of a discovery which it would have been\r\ninjurious to my pride to have had confined entirely to yourself."\r\n\r\n"I can understand," I repeated, and trusted myself to say no more, hot\r\nas my secret felt upon my lips.\r\n\r\n"You have read Poe\'s story of the filigree basket?" he now suggested,\r\nrunning his finger up and down the filigree work he himself held.\r\n\r\nI nodded. I saw what he meant at once.\r\n\r\n"Well, the principle involved in that story explains the presence of the\r\nrings in the midst of this stack of letters. Franklin Van Burnam, if he\r\nis the murderer of his sister-in-law, is one of the subtlest villains\r\nthis city has ever produced, and knowing that, if once suspected, every\r\nsecret drawer and professed hiding-place within his reach would be\r\nsearched, he put these dangerous evidences of his guilt in a place so\r\nconspicuous, and yet so little likely to attract attention, that even so\r\nold a hand as myself did not think of looking for them there."\r\n\r\nHe had finished, and the look he gave me was for myself alone.\r\n\r\n"And now, madam," said he, "that I have stated the facts of the case\r\nagainst Franklin Van Burnam, has not the moment come for you to show\r\nyour appreciation of my good nature by a corresponding show of\r\nconfidence on your part?"\r\n\r\nI answered with a distinct negative. "There is too much that is\r\nunexplained as yet in your case against Franklin," I objected. "You have\r\nshown that he had motive for the murder and that he was connected more\r\nor less intimately with the crime we are considering, but you have by no\r\nmeans explained all the phenomena accompanying this tragedy. How, for\r\ninstance, do you account for Mrs. Van Burnam\'s whim in changing her\r\nclothing, if her brother-in-law, instead of her husband, was her\r\ncompanion at the Hotel D----?"\r\n\r\nYou see I was determined to know the whole story before introducing Miss\r\nOliver\'s name into this complication.\r\n\r\nHe who had seen through the devices of so many women in his day did not\r\nsee through mine, perhaps because he took a certain professional\r\npleasure in making his views on this subject clear to the attentive\r\nInspector. At all events, this is the way he responded to my\r\nhalf-curious, half-ironical question:\r\n\r\n"A crime planned and perpetrated for the purpose I have just mentioned,\r\nMiss Butterworth, could not have been a simple one under any\r\ncircumstances. But conceived as this one was by a man of more than\r\nordinary intelligence, and carried out with a skill and precaution\r\nlittle short of marvellous, the features which it presents are of such a\r\nvarying and subtle character that only by the exercise of a certain\r\namount of imagination can they be understood at all. Such an imagination\r\nI possess, but how can I be sure that you do?"\r\n\r\n"By testing it," I suggested.\r\n\r\n"Very good, madam, I will. Not from actual knowledge, then, but from a\r\ncertain insight I have acquired in my long dealing with such matters, I\r\nhave come to the conclusion that Franklin Van Burnam did not in the\r\nbeginning plan to kill this woman in his father\'s house.\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, he had fixed upon a hotel room as the scene of the\r\nconflict he foresaw between them, and that he might carry it on without\r\nendangering their good names, had urged her to meet him the next morning\r\nin the semi-disguise of a gossamer over her fine dress and a heavy veil\r\nover her striking features; making the pretence, no doubt, of this being\r\nthe more appropriate costume for her to appear in before the old\r\ngentleman should he so far concede to her demands as to take her to the\r\nsteamer. For himself he had planned the adoption of a disfiguring duster\r\nwhich had been hanging for a long time in a closet on the ground-floor\r\nof the building in Duane Street. All this promised well, but when the\r\ntime came and he was about to leave his office, his brother unexpectedly\r\nappeared and asked for the key to their father\'s house. Disconcerted no\r\ndoubt by the appearance of the very person he least wished to see, and\r\nastonished by a request so out of keeping with all that had hitherto\r\npassed between them, he nevertheless was in too much haste to question\r\nhim, so gave him what he wanted and Howard went away. As soon after as\r\nhe could lock his desk and don his hat, Franklin followed, and merely\r\nstopping to cover his coat with the old duster, he went out and hastened\r\ntowards the place of meeting. Under most circumstances all this might\r\nhave happened without the brothers encountering each other again, but a\r\ntemporary obstruction on the sidewalk having, as we know, detained\r\nHoward, Franklin was enabled to approach him sufficiently close to see\r\nhim draw his pocket-handkerchief out of his pocket, and with it the keys\r\nwhich he had just given him. The latter fell, and as there was a great\r\npounding of iron going on in the building just over their heads, Howard\r\ndid not perceive his loss but went quickly on. Franklin coming up behind\r\nhim picked up the keys, and with a thought, or perhaps as yet with no\r\nthought, of the use to which they might be applied, put them in his own\r\npocket before proceeding on his way.\r\n\r\n"New York is a large place, and much can take place in it without\r\ncomment. Franklin Van Burnam and his sister-in-law met and went together\r\nto the Hotel D---- without being either recognized or suspected till\r\nlater developments drew attention to them. That _she_ should consent to\r\naccompany him to this place, and that after she was there should submit,\r\nas she did, to taking all the business of the scheme upon herself, would\r\nbe inconceivable in a woman of a self-respecting character; but Louise\r\nVan Burnam cared for little save her own aggrandisement, and rather\r\nenjoyed, so far as we can see, this very doubtful escapade, whose real\r\nmeaning and murderous purpose she was so far from understanding.\r\n\r\n"As the steamer, contrary to all expectation, had not yet been sighted\r\noff Fire Island, they took a room and prepared to wait for it. That is,\r\n_she_ prepared to wait. He had no intention of waiting for its arrival\r\nor of going to it when it came; he only wanted his letter. But Louise\r\nVan Burnam was not the woman to relinquish it till she had obtained the\r\nprice she had put on it, and he becoming very soon aware of this fact,\r\nbegan to ask himself if he should not be obliged to resort to extreme\r\nmeasures in order to regain it. One chance only remained for avoiding\r\nthese. He would seem to embrace her later and probably much-talked-of\r\nscheme of presenting herself before his father in his own house rather\r\nthan at the steamer; and by urging her to make its success more certain\r\nby a different style of dress from that she wore, induce a change of\r\nclothing, during which he might come upon the letter he was more than\r\nconfident she carried about her person. Had this plan worked; had he\r\nbeen able to seize upon this compromising bit of paper, even at the cost\r\nof a scratch or two from her vigorous fingers, we should not be sitting\r\nhere at this moment trying to account for the most complicated crime on\r\nrecord. But Louise Van Burnam, while weak and volatile enough to enjoy\r\nthe romantic features of this transformation scene, even going so far as\r\nto write out the order herself with the same effort at disguise she had\r\nused in registering their assumed names at the desk, was not entirely\r\nhis dupe, and having hidden the letter in her shoe----"\r\n\r\n"What!" I cried.\r\n\r\n"_Having hidden the letter in her shoe_," repeated Mr. Gryce, with his\r\nfinest smile, "she had but to signify that the boots sent by Altman were\r\na size too small, for her to retain her secret and keep the one article\r\nshe traded upon from his envious clutch. You seem struck dumb by this,\r\nMiss Butterworth. Have I enlightened you on a point that has hitherto\r\ntroubled you?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t ask me; don\'t look at me." As if he ever looked at any one! "Your\r\nperspicacity is amazing, but I will try and not show my sense of it, if\r\nit is going to make you stop."\r\n\r\nHe smiled; the Inspector smiled: neither understood me.\r\n\r\n"Very well then, I will go on; but the non-change of shoes had to be\r\naccounted for, Miss Butterworth."\r\n\r\n"You are right; and it _has_ been, of course."\r\n\r\n"Have you any better explanation to give?"\r\n\r\nI had, or thought I had, and the words trembled on my tongue. But I\r\nrestrained myself under an air of great impatience. "Time is flying!" I\r\nurged, with as near a simulation of his own manner in saying the words\r\nas I could affect. "Go on, Mr. Gryce."\r\n\r\nAnd he did, though my manner evidently puzzled him.\r\n\r\n"Being foiled in this his last attempt, this smooth and diabolical\r\nvillain hesitated no longer in carrying out the scheme which had\r\ndoubtless been maturing in his mind ever since he dropped the key of his\r\nfather\'s house into his own pocket. His brother\'s wife must die, but not\r\nin a hotel room with him for a companion. Though scorned, detested, and\r\na stumbling-block in the way of the whole family\'s future happiness and\r\nprosperity, she still was a Van Burnam, and no shadow must fall upon her\r\nreputation. Further than this, for he loved life and his own reputation\r\nalso, and did not mean to endanger either by this act of\r\nself-preservation, she must perish as if from accident, or by some blow\r\nso undiscoverable that it would be laid to natural causes. He thought he\r\nknew how this might be brought about. He had seen her put on her hat\r\nwith a very thin and sharp pin, and he had heard how one thrust into a\r\ncertain spot in the spine would effect death without a struggle. A wound\r\nlike that would be small; almost indiscernible. True it would take skill\r\nto inflict it, and it would require dissimulation to bring her into the\r\nproper position for the contemplated thrust; but he was not lacking in\r\neither of these characteristics; and so he set himself to the task he\r\nhad promised himself, and with such success that ere long the two left\r\nthe hotel and proceeded to the house in Gramercy Park with all the\r\ncaution necessary for preserving a secret which meant reputation to the\r\none, and liberty, if not life, to the other. That he and not she felt\r\nthe greater need of secrecy, witness their whole conduct, and when,\r\ntheir goal reached, she and not he put the money into the driver\'s hand,\r\nthe last act of this curious drama of opposing motives was reached, and\r\nonly the final catastrophe was wanting.\r\n\r\n"With what arts he procured her hat-pin, and by what show of simulated\r\npassion he was able to approach near enough to her to inflict that cool\r\nand calculating thrust which resulted in her immediate death, I leave to\r\n_your_ imagination. Enough that he compassed his ends, killing her and\r\nregaining the letter for the possession of which he had been willing to\r\ntake a life. Afterwards----"\r\n\r\n"Well, afterwards?"\r\n\r\n"The deed he had thought so complete began to assume a different aspect.\r\nThe pin had broken in the wound, and, knowing the scrutiny which the\r\nbody would receive at the hands of a Coroner\'s jury, he began to see\r\nwhat consequences might follow its discovery. So to hide that wound and\r\ngive to her death the wished-for appearance of accident, he went back\r\nand drew down the cabinet under which she was found. Had he done this at\r\nonce his hand in the tragedy might have escaped detection, but he\r\nwaited, and by waiting allowed the blood-vessels to stiffen and all\r\nthat phenomena to become apparent by means of which the eyes of the\r\nphysicians were opened to the fact that they must search deeper for the\r\ncause of death than the bruises she had received. Thus it is that\r\nJustice opens loop-holes in the finest web a criminal can weave."\r\n\r\n"A just remark, Mr. Gryce, but in this fine-spun web of _your_ weaving,\r\nyou have not explained how the clock came to be running and to stop at\r\nfive."\r\n\r\n"Cannot you see? A man capable of such a crime would not forget to\r\nprovide himself with an alibi. He expected to be in his rooms at five,\r\nso before pulling down the shelves at three or four, he wound the clock\r\nand set it at an hour when he could bring forward testimony to his being\r\nin another place. Is not such a theory consistent with his character and\r\nwith the skill he has displayed from the beginning to the end of this\r\nwoful affair?"\r\n\r\nAghast at the deftness with which this able detective explained every\r\ndetail of this crime by means of a theory necessarily hypothetical if\r\nthe discoveries I had made in the matter were true, and for the moment\r\nsubjected to the overwhelming influence of his enthusiasm, I sat in a\r\nmaze, asking myself if all the seemingly irrefutable evidence upon which\r\nmen had been convicted in times gone by was as false as this. To relieve\r\nmyself and to gain renewed confidence in my own views and the\r\ndiscoveries I had made in this matter, I repeated the name of Howard,\r\nand asked how, in case the whole crime was conceived and perpetrated by\r\nhis brother, he came to utter such equivocations and to assume that\r\nposition of guilt which had led to his own arrest.\r\n\r\n"Do you think," I inquired, "that he was aware of his brother\'s part in\r\nthis affair, and that out of compassion for him he endeavored to take\r\nthe crime upon his own shoulders?"\r\n\r\n"No, madam. Men of the world do not carry their disinterestedness so\r\nfar. He not only did not know the part his brother took in this crime,\r\nbut did not even suspect it, or why acknowledge that he lost the key by\r\nwhich the house was entered?"\r\n\r\n"I do not understand Howard\'s actions, even under these circumstances.\r\nThey seem totally inconsistent to me."\r\n\r\n"Madam, they are easily explainable to one who knows the character of\r\nhis mind. He prizes his honor above every consideration, and regarded it\r\nas threatened by the suggestion that his wife had entered his father\'s\r\nempty house at midnight with another man. To save himself that shame, he\r\nwas willing not only to perjure himself, but to take upon himself the\r\nconsequences of his perjury. Quixotic, certainly, but some men are\r\nconstituted that way, and he, for all his amiable characteristics, is\r\nthe most dogged man I ever encountered. That he ran against snags in his\r\nattempted explanations, seemed to make no difference to him. He was\r\nbound that no one should accuse him of marrying a false woman, even if\r\nhe must bear the opprobrium of her death. It is hard to understand such\r\na nature, but re-read his testimony, and see if this explanation of his\r\nconduct is not correct."\r\n\r\nAnd still I mechanically repeated: "I do not understand."\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce may not have been a patient man under all circumstances, but\r\nhe was patient with me that day.\r\n\r\n"It was his ignorance, Miss Butterworth, his total ignorance of the\r\nwhole affair that led him into the inconsistencies he manifested. Let me\r\npresent his case as I already have his brother\'s. He knew that his wife\r\nhad come to New York to appeal to his father, and he gathered from what\r\nshe said that she intended to do this either in his house or on the\r\ndock. To cut short any opportunity she might have for committing the\r\nfirst folly, he begged the key of the house from his brother, and,\r\nsupposing that he had it all right, went to his rooms, not to Coney\r\nIsland as he said, and began to pack up his trunks. For he meant to flee\r\nthe country if his wife disgraced him. He was tired of her caprices and\r\nmeant to cut them short as far as he was himself concerned. But the\r\nstriking of the midnight hour brought better counsel. He began to wonder\r\nwhat she had been doing in his absence. Going out, he haunted the region\r\nof Gramercy Park for the better part of the night, and at daybreak\r\nactually mounted the steps of his father\'s house and prepared to enter\r\nit by means of the key he had obtained from his brother. But the key was\r\nnot in his pocket, so he came down again and walked away, attracting the\r\nattention of Mr. Stone as he did so. The next day he heard of the\r\ntragedy which had taken place within those very walls; and though his\r\nfirst fears led him to believe that the victim was his wife, a sight of\r\nher clothes naturally dispelled this apprehension, for he knew nothing\r\nof her visit to the Hotel D---- or of the change in her habiliments\r\nwhich had taken place there. His father\'s persistent fears and the quiet\r\npressure brought to bear upon him by the police only irritated him, and\r\nnot until confronted by the hat found on the scene of death, an article\r\nonly too well known as his wife\'s, did he yield to the accumulated\r\nevidence in support of her identity. Immediately he felt the full force\r\nof his unkindness towards her, and rushing to the Morgue had her poor\r\nbody taken to that father\'s house and afterwards given a decent burial.\r\nBut he could not accept the shame which this acknowledgment naturally\r\nbrought with it, and, blind to all consequences, insisted, when brought\r\nup again for examination, that he was the man with whom she came to that\r\nlonely house. The difficulties into which this plunged him were partly\r\nforeseen and partly prepared for, and he showed some skill in\r\nsurmounting them. But falsehoods never fit like truths, and we all felt\r\nthe strain on our credulity as he met and attempted to parry the\r\nCoroner\'s questions.\r\n\r\n"And now, Miss Butterworth, let me again ask if your turn has not come\r\nat last for adding the sum of your evidence to ours against Franklin Van\r\nBurnam?"\r\n\r\nIt had; I could not deny it, and as I realized that with it had also\r\ncome the opportunity for justifying the pretensions I had made, I raised\r\nmy head with suitable spirit and, after a momentary pause for the\r\npurpose of making my words the more impressive, I asked:\r\n\r\n"And what has made you think that _I_ was interested in fixing the guilt\r\non Franklin Van Burnam?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII.\r\n\r\nICONOCLASM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe surprise which this very simple question occasioned, showed itself\r\ndifferently in the two men who heard it. The Inspector, who had never\r\nseen me before, simply stared, while Mr. Gryce, with that admirable\r\ncommand over himself which has helped to make him the most successful\r\nman on the force, retained his impassibility, though I noticed a small\r\ncorner drop from my filigree basket as if crushed off by an inadvertent\r\npressure of his hand.\r\n\r\n"I judged," was his calm reply, as he laid down the injured toy with an\r\napologetic grunt, "that the clearing of Howard from suspicion meant the\r\nestablishment of another man\'s guilt; and so far as we can see there has\r\nbeen no other party in the case besides these two brothers."\r\n\r\n"No? Then I fear a great surprise awaits you, Mr. Gryce. This crime,\r\nwhich you have fixed with such care and seeming probability upon\r\nFranklin Van Burnam, was not, in my judgment, perpetrated either by him\r\nor any other man. It was the act of a woman."\r\n\r\n"A WOMAN?"\r\n\r\nBoth men spoke: the Inspector, as if he thought me demented; Mr. Gryce,\r\nas if he would like to have considered me a fool but dared not.\r\n\r\n"Yes, a _woman_," I repeated, dropping a quiet curtsey. It was a proper\r\nexpression of respect when I was young, and I see no reason why it\r\nshould not be a proper expression of respect now, except that we have\r\nlost our manners in gaining our independence, something which is to be\r\nregretted perhaps. "A woman whom I know; a woman whom I can lay my hands\r\non at a half-hour\'s notice; a young woman, sirs; a pretty woman, the\r\nowner of one of the two hats found in the Van Burnam parlors."\r\n\r\nHad I exploded a bomb-shell the Inspector could not have looked more\r\nastounded. The detective, who was a man of greater self-command, did not\r\nbetray his feelings so plainly, though he was not entirely without them,\r\nfor, as I made this statement, he turned and looked at me; _Mr. Gryce_\r\nlooked at me.\r\n\r\n"Both of those hats belonged to Mrs. Van Burnam," he protested; "the one\r\nshe wore from Haddam; the other was in the order from Altman\'s."\r\n\r\n"She never ordered anything from Altman\'s," was my uncompromising reply.\r\n"The woman whom I saw enter next door, and who was the same who left the\r\nHotel D---- with the man in the linen duster, was not Louise Van Burnam.\r\nShe was that lady\'s rival, and let me say it, for I dare to think it,\r\nnot only her rival but the prospective taker of her life. O you need not\r\nshake your heads at each other so significantly, gentlemen. I have been\r\ncollecting evidence as well as yourselves, and what I have learned is\r\nvery much to the point; very much, indeed."\r\n\r\n"The deuce you have!" muttered the Inspector, turning away from me; but\r\nMr. Gryce continued to eye me like a man fascinated.\r\n\r\n"Upon what," said he, "do you base these extraordinary assertions? I\r\nshould like to hear what that evidence is."\r\n\r\n"But first," said I, "I must take a few exceptions to certain points you\r\nconsider yourself to have made against Franklin Van Burnam. You believe\r\nhim to have committed this crime because you found in a secret drawer of\r\nhis desk a letter known to have been in Mrs. Van Burnam\'s hands the day\r\nshe was murdered, and which you, naturally enough, I acknowledge,\r\nconceive he could only have regained by murdering her. But have you not\r\nthought of another way in which he could have obtained it, a perfectly\r\nharmless way, involving no one either in deceit or crime? May it not\r\nhave been in the little hand-bag returned by Mrs. Parker on the morning\r\nof the discovery, and may not its crumpled condition be accounted for by\r\nthe haste with which Franklin might have thrust it into his secret\r\ndrawer at the untoward entrance of some one into his office?"\r\n\r\n"I acknowledge that I have not thought of such a possibility," growled\r\nthe detective, below his breath, but I saw that his self-satisfaction\r\nhad been shaken.\r\n\r\n"As for any proof of complicity being given by the presence of the rings\r\non the hook attached to his desk, I grieve for your sake to be obliged\r\nto dispel that illusion also. Those rings, Mr. Gryce and Mr. Inspector,\r\nwere not discovered there by the girl in gray, but taken there; and hung\r\nthere at the very moment your spy saw her hand fumbling with the\r\npapers."\r\n\r\n"Taken there, and hung there by your maid! By the girl Lena, who has so\r\nevidently been working in _your_ interests! What sort of a confession\r\nare you making, Miss Butterworth?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, Mr. Gryce," I gently remonstrated, for I actually pitied the old\r\nman in his hour of humiliation, "other girls wear gray besides Lena. It\r\nwas the woman of the Hotel D---- who played this trick in Mr. Van\r\nBurnam\'s office. Lena was not out of my house that day."\r\n\r\nI had never thought Mr. Gryce feeble, though I knew he was over seventy\r\nif not very near the octogenarian age. But he drew up a chair at this\r\nand hastily sat down.\r\n\r\n"Tell me about this other girl," said he.\r\n\r\nBut before I repeat what I said to him, I must explain by what reasoning\r\nI had arrived at the conclusion I have just mentioned. That Ruth Oliver\r\nwas the visitor in Mr. Van Burnam\'s office there was but little reason\r\nto doubt; that her errand was one in connection with the rings was\r\nequally plain. What else would have driven her from her bed when she was\r\nhardly able to stand, and sent her in a state of fever, if not delirium,\r\ndown town to this office?\r\n\r\nShe feared having these rings found in her possession, and she also\r\ncherished a desire to throw whatever suspicion was attached to them upon\r\nthe man who was already compromised. She may have thought it was\r\nHoward\'s desk she approached, and she may have known it to be\r\nFranklin\'s. On that point I was in doubt, but the rest was clear to me\r\nfrom the moment Mr. Gryce mentioned the girl in gray; and even the spot\r\nwhere she had kept them in the interim since the murder was no longer an\r\nunsolved mystery to me. Her emotion when I touched her knitting-work\r\nand the shreds of unravelled wool I had found lying about after her\r\ndeparture, had set my wits working, and I comprehended now _that they\r\nhad been wound up in the ball of yarn I had so carelessly handled_.\r\n\r\nBut what had I to say to Mr. Gryce in answer to his question. Much; and\r\nseeing that further delay was injudicious, I began my story then and\r\nthere. Prefacing my tale with the suspicions I had always had of Mrs.\r\nBoppert, I told them of my interview with that woman and of the valuable\r\nclue she had given me by confessing that she had let Mrs. Van Burnam\r\ninto the house prior to the visit of the couple who entered there at\r\nmidnight. Knowing what an effect this must produce upon Mr. Gryce,\r\nutterly unprepared for it as he was, I looked for some burst of anger on\r\nhis part, or at least some expression of self-reproach. But he only\r\nbroke a second piece off my little filigree basket, and, totally\r\nunconscious of the demolition he was causing, cried out with true\r\nprofessional delight:\r\n\r\n"Well! well! I\'ve always said this was a remarkable case, a very\r\nremarkable case; but if we don\'t look out it will go ahead of that one\r\nat Sibley. _Two_ women in the affair, and one of them in the house\r\nbefore the arrival of the so-called victim and her murderer! What do you\r\nthink of that, Inspector? Rather late for us to find out so important a\r\ndetail, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Rather," was the dry reply. At which Mr. Gryce\'s face grew long and he\r\nexclaimed, half shamefacedly, half jocularly:\r\n\r\n"Outwitted by a woman! Well, it\'s a new experience for me, Inspector,\r\nand you must not be surprised if it takes me a minute or so to get\r\naccustomed to it. A scrub-woman too! It cuts, Inspector, it cuts."\r\n\r\nBut as I went on, and he learned how I had obtained definite proof of\r\nthe clock having been not only wound by the lady thus admitted to the\r\nhouse, but set also and that correctly, his face grew even longer, and\r\nhe gazed quite dolefully at the small figure in the carpet to which he\r\nhad transferred his attention.\r\n\r\n"So! so!" came in almost indistinguishable murmur from his lips. "All my\r\npretty theory in regard to its being set by the criminal for the purpose\r\nof confirming his attempt at a false alibi was but a figment of my\r\nimagination, eh? Sad! sad! But it was neat enough to have been true, was\r\nit not, Inspector?"\r\n\r\n"Quite," that gentleman good-humoredly admitted, yet with a shade of\r\nirony in his tone that made me suspect that, for all his confidence in\r\nand evident admiration for this brilliant old detective, he felt a\r\ncertain amount of pleasure at seeing him for once at fault. Perhaps it\r\ngave him more confidence in his own judgment, seeing that their ideas on\r\nthis case had been opposed from the start.\r\n\r\n"Well! well! I\'m getting old; that\'s what they\'ll say at Headquarters\r\nto-morrow. But go on, Miss Butterworth; let us hear what followed; for I\r\nam sure your investigations did not stop there."\r\n\r\nI complied with his request with as much modesty as possible. But it was\r\nhard to suppress all triumph in face of the unrestrained enthusiasm with\r\nwhich he received my communication. When I told him of the doubts I had\r\nformed in regard to the disposal of the packages brought from the Hotel\r\nD----, and how to settle those doubts I had taken that midnight walk\r\ndown Twenty-seventh Street, he looked astonished, his lips worked, and I\r\nreally expected to see him try to pluck that flower up from the carpet,\r\nhe ogled it so lovingly. But when I mentioned the lighted laundry and my\r\ndiscoveries there, his admiration burst all bounds, and he cried out,\r\nseemingly to the rose in the carpet, really to the Inspector:\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I tell you she was a woman in a thousand? See now! we ought to\r\nhave thought of that laundry ourselves; but we didn\'t, none of us did;\r\nwe were too credulous and too easily satisfied with the evidence given\r\nat the inquest. Well, I\'m seventy-seven, but I\'m not too old to learn.\r\nProceed, Miss Butterworth."\r\n\r\nI admired him and I was sorry for him, but I never enjoyed myself so\r\nmuch in my whole life. How could I help it, or how could I prevent\r\nmyself from throwing a glance now and then at the picture of my father\r\nsmiling upon me from the opposite wall?\r\n\r\nIt was my task now to mention the advertisement I had inserted in the\r\nnewspapers, and the reflections which had led to my rather daring\r\ndescription of the wandering woman as one dressed thus and so, and\r\n_without a hat_. This seemed to strike him--as I had expected it\r\nwould,--and he interrupted me with a quick slap of his leg, for which\r\nonly that leg was prepared.\r\n\r\n"Good!" he ejaculated; "a fine stroke! The work of a woman of genius! I\r\ncould not have done better myself, Miss Butterworth. And what came of\r\nit? Something, I hope; talent like yours should not go unrewarded."\r\n\r\n"Two letters came of it," said I. "One from Cox, the milliner, saying\r\nthat a bareheaded girl had bought a hat in his shop early on the morning\r\ndesignated; and another from a Mrs. Desberger appointing a meeting at\r\nwhich I obtained a definite clue to this girl, who, notwithstanding she\r\nwore Mrs. Van Burnam\'s clothes from the scene of tragedy, is not Mrs.\r\nVan Burnam herself, but a person by the name of Oliver, now to be found\r\nat Miss Althorpe\'s house in Twenty-first Street."\r\n\r\nAs this was in a measure putting the matter into their hands, I saw them\r\nboth grow impatient in their anxiety to see this girl for themselves.\r\nBut I kept them for a few minutes longer while I related my discovery of\r\nthe money in her shoes, and hinted at the explanation it afforded for\r\nher not changing those articles under the influence of the man who\r\naccompanied her.\r\n\r\nThis was the last blow I dealt to the pride of Mr. Gryce. He quivered\r\nunder it, but soon recovered, and was able to enjoy what he called\r\nanother fine point in this remarkable case.\r\n\r\nBut the acme of his delight was reached when I informed him of my\r\nineffectual search for the rings, and my final conclusion that they had\r\nbeen wound up in the ball of yarn attached to her knitting-work.\r\n\r\nWhether his pleasure lay chiefly in the talent shown by Miss Oliver in\r\nher choice of a hiding-place for these jewels, or in the acumen\r\ndisplayed by myself in discovering it, I do not know; but he evinced an\r\nunbounded satisfaction in my words, crying aloud:\r\n\r\n"Beautiful! I don\'t know of anything more interesting! We have not seen\r\nthe like in years! I can almost congratulate myself upon my mistakes,\r\nthe features of the case they have brought out are so fine!"\r\n\r\nBut his satisfaction, great as it was, soon gave way to his anxiety to\r\nsee this girl who, if not the criminal herself, was so important a\r\nfactor in this great crime.\r\n\r\nI was anxious myself to have him see her, though I feared her condition\r\nwas not such as to promise him any immediate enlightenment on the\r\ndoubtful portions of this far from thoroughly mastered problem. And I\r\nbade him interview the Chinaman also, and Mrs. Desberger, and even Mrs.\r\nBoppert, for I did not wish him to take for granted anything I had said,\r\nthough I saw he had lost his attitude of disdain and was inclined to\r\naccept my opinions quite seriously.\r\n\r\nHe answered in quite an off-hand manner while the Inspector stood by,\r\nbut when that gentleman had withdrawn towards the door, Mr. Gryce\r\nremarked with more earnestness than he had yet used:\r\n\r\n"You have saved me from committing a folly, Miss Butterworth. If I had\r\narrested Franklin Van Burnam to-day, and to-morrow all these facts had\r\ncome to light, I should never have held up my head again. As it is,\r\nthere will be numerous insinuations uttered by men on the force, and\r\nmany a whisper will go about that Gryce is getting old, that Gryce has\r\nseen his best days."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" was my vigorous rejoinder. "You didn\'t have the clue, that\r\nis all. Nor did I get it through any keenness on my part, but from the\r\nforce of circumstances. Mrs. Boppert thought herself indebted to me, and\r\nso gave me her confidence. Your laurels are very safe yet. Besides,\r\nthere is enough work left on this case to keep more than one great\r\ndetective like you busy. While the Van Burnams have not been proved\r\nguilty, they are not so freed from suspicion that you can regard your\r\ntask as completed. If Ruth Oliver committed this crime, which of these\r\ntwo brothers was involved in it with her? The facts seem to point\r\ntowards Franklin, but not so unerringly that no doubt is possible on the\r\nsubject."\r\n\r\n"True, true. The mystery has deepened rather than cleared. Miss\r\nButterworth, you will accompany me to Miss Althorpe\'s."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII.\r\n\r\n"KNOWN, KNOWN, ALL KNOWN."\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce possesses one faculty for which I envy him, and that is his\r\nskill in the management of people. He had not been in Miss Althorpe\'s\r\nhouse five minutes before he had won her confidence and had everything\r\nhe wished at his command. _I_ had to talk some time before getting so\r\nfar, but _he_--a word and a look did it.\r\n\r\nMiss Oliver, for whom I hesitated to inquire, lest I should again find\r\nher gone or in a worse condition than when I left, was in reality\r\nbetter, and as we went up-stairs I allowed myself to hope that the\r\nquestions which had so troubled us would soon be answered and the\r\nmystery ended.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Gryce evidently knew better, for when we reached her door he\r\nturned and said:\r\n\r\n"Our task will not be an easy one. Go in first and attract her attention\r\nso that I can enter unobserved. I wish to study her before addressing\r\nher; but, mind, no words about the murder; leave that to me."\r\n\r\nI nodded, feeling that I was falling back into my own place; and\r\nknocking softly entered the room.\r\n\r\nA maid was sitting with her. Seeing me, she rose and advanced, saying:\r\n\r\n"Miss Oliver is sleeping."\r\n\r\n"Then I will relieve you," I returned, beckoning Mr. Gryce to come in.\r\n\r\nThe girl left us and we two contemplated the sick woman silently.\r\nPresently I saw Mr. Gryce shake his head. But he did not tell me what he\r\nmeant by it.\r\n\r\nFollowing the direction of his finger, I sat down in a chair at the head\r\nof the bed; he took his station at the side of it in a large arm-chair\r\nhe saw there. As he did so I saw how fatherly and kind he really looked,\r\nand wondered if he was in the habit of so preparing himself to meet the\r\neye of all the suspected criminals he encountered. The thought made me\r\nglance again her way. She lay like a statue, and her face, naturally\r\nround but now thinned out and hollow, looked up from the pillow in\r\npitiful quiet, the long lashes accentuating the dark places under her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nA sad face, the saddest I ever saw and one of the most haunting.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to find it so also, for his expression of benevolent interest\r\ndeepened with every passing moment, till suddenly she stirred; then he\r\ngave me a warning glance, and stooping, took her by the wrist and pulled\r\nout his watch.\r\n\r\nShe was deceived by the action. Opening her eyes, she surveyed him\r\nlanguidly for a moment, then heaving a great sigh, turned aside her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell me I am better, doctor. I do not want to live."\r\n\r\nThe plaintive tone, the refined accent, seemed to astonish him. Laying\r\ndown her hand, he answered gently:\r\n\r\n"I do not like to hear that from such young lips, but it assures me that\r\nI was correct in my first surmise, that it is not medicine you need but\r\na friend. And I can be that friend if you will but allow me."\r\n\r\nMoved, encouraged for the instant, she turned her head from side to\r\nside, probably to see if they were alone, and not observing me, answered\r\nsoftly:\r\n\r\n"You are very good, very thoughtful, doctor, but"--and here her despair\r\nreturned again--"it is useless; you can do nothing for me."\r\n\r\n"You think so," remonstrated the old detective, "but you do not know me,\r\nchild. Let me show you that I can be of benefit to you." And he drew\r\nfrom his pocket a little package which he opened before her astonished\r\neyes. "Yesterday, in your delirium, you left these rings in an office\r\ndown-town. As they are valuable, I have brought them back to you. Wasn\'t\r\nI right, my child?"\r\n\r\n"No! no!" She started up, and her accents betrayed terror and anguish,\r\n"I do not want them; I cannot bear to see them; they do not belong to\r\n_me_; they belong to _them_."\r\n\r\n"To _them_? Whom do you mean by them?" queried Mr. Gryce, insinuatingly.\r\n\r\n"The--the Van Burnams. Is not that the name? Oh, do not make me talk; I\r\nam so weak! Only take the rings back."\r\n\r\n"I will, child, I will." Mr. Gryce\'s voice was more than fatherly now,\r\nit was tender, really and sincerely tender. "I will take them back; but\r\nto which of the brothers shall I return them? To"--he hesitated\r\nsoftly--"to Franklin or to Howard?"\r\n\r\nI expected to hear her respond, his manner was so gentle and apparently\r\nsincere. But though feverish and on the verge of wildness, she had still\r\nsome command over herself, and after giving him a look, the intensity\r\nof which called out a corresponding expression on his face, she faltered\r\nout:\r\n\r\n"I--I don\'t care; I don\'t know either of the gentlemen; but to the one\r\nyou call Howard, I think."\r\n\r\nThe pause which followed was filled by the tap-tap of Mr. Gryce\'s\r\nfingers on his knee.\r\n\r\n"That is the one who is in custody," he observed at last. "The other,\r\nthat is Franklin, has gone scot-free thus far, I hear."\r\n\r\nNo answer from her close-shut lips.\r\n\r\nHe waited.\r\n\r\nStill no answer.\r\n\r\n"If you do not know either of these gentlemen," he insinuated at last,\r\n"how did you come to leave the rings at their office?"\r\n\r\n"I knew their names--I inquired my way--It is all a dream now. Please,\r\nplease do not ask me questions. O doctor! do you not see I cannot bear\r\nit?"\r\n\r\nHe smiled--I never could smile like that under any circumstances--and\r\nsoftly patted her hand.\r\n\r\n"I see it makes you suffer," he acknowledged, "but I must make you\r\nsuffer in order to do you any good. If you would tell me all you know\r\nabout these rings----"\r\n\r\nShe passionately turned away her head.\r\n\r\n"I might hope to restore you to health and happiness. You know with what\r\nthey are associated?"\r\n\r\nShe made a slight motion.\r\n\r\n"And that they are an invaluable clue to the murderer of Mrs. Van\r\nBurnam?"\r\n\r\nAnother motion.\r\n\r\n"How then, my child, did _you_ come to have them?"\r\n\r\nHer head, which was rolling to and fro on the pillow, stopped and she\r\ngasped, rather than uttered:\r\n\r\n"I was _there_."\r\n\r\nHe knew this, yet it was terrible to hear it from her lips; she was so\r\nyoung and had such an air of purity and innocence. But more heartrending\r\nyet was the groan with which she burst forth in another moment, as if\r\nimpelled by conscience to unburden herself from some overwhelming load:\r\n\r\n"I took them; I could not help it; but I did not keep them; you know\r\nthat I did not keep them. I am no thief, doctor; whatever I am, I am no\r\nthief."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I see that. But why take them, child? What were you doing in\r\nthat house, and whom were you with?"\r\n\r\nShe threw up her arms, but made no reply.\r\n\r\n"Will you not tell?" he urged.\r\n\r\nA short silence, then a low "No," evidently wrung from her by the\r\ndeepest anguish.\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce heaved a sigh; the struggle was likely to be a more serious\r\none than he had anticipated.\r\n\r\n"Miss Oliver," said he, "more facts are known in relation to this affair\r\nthan you imagine. Though unsuspected at first, it has secretly been\r\nproven that the man who accompanied the woman into the house where the\r\ncrime took place, was _Franklin_ Van Burnam."\r\n\r\nA low gasp from the bed, and that was all.\r\n\r\n"You know this to be correct, don\'t you, Miss Oliver?"\r\n\r\n"O must you ask?" She was writhing now, and I thought he must desist out\r\nof pure compassion. But detectives are made out of very stern stuff, and\r\nthough he looked sorry he went inexorably on.\r\n\r\n"Justice and a sincere desire to help you, force me, my child. Were you\r\nnot the woman who entered Mr. Van Burnam\'s house at midnight with this\r\nman?"\r\n\r\n"I entered the house."\r\n\r\n"At midnight?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And with this man?"\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n"You do not speak, Miss Oliver."\r\n\r\nAgain silence.\r\n\r\n"It was Franklin who was with you at the Hotel D----?"\r\n\r\nShe uttered a cry.\r\n\r\n"And it was Franklin who connived at your change of clothing there, and\r\nadvised or allowed you to dress yourself in a new suit from Altman\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" she cried again.\r\n\r\n"Then why should it not have been he who accompanied you to the\r\nChinaman\'s, and afterwards took you in a second hack to the house in\r\nGramercy Park?"\r\n\r\n"Known, known, all known!" was her moan.\r\n\r\n"Sin and crime cannot long remain hidden in this world, Miss Oliver. The\r\npolice are acquainted with all your movements from the moment you left\r\nthe Hotel D----. That is why I have compassion on you. I wish to save\r\nyou from the consequences of a crime you saw committed, but in which you\r\ntook no hand."\r\n\r\n"O," she exclaimed in one involuntary burst, as she half rose to her\r\nknees, "if you could save me from appearing in the matter at all! If you\r\nwould let me run away----"\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Gryce was not the man to give her hope on any such score.\r\n\r\n"Impossible, Miss Oliver. You are the only person who can witness for\r\nthe guilty. If _I_ should let you go, the police would not. Then why not\r\ntell at once whose hand drew the hat-pin from your hat and----"\r\n\r\n"Stop!" she shrieked; "stop! you kill me! I cannot bear it! If you bring\r\nthat moment back to my mind I shall go mad! I feel the horror of it\r\nrising in me now! Be still! I pray you, for God\'s sake, to be still!"\r\n\r\nThis was mortal anguish; there was no acting in this. Even he was\r\nstartled by the emotion he had raised, and sat for a moment without\r\nspeaking. Then the necessity of providing against all further mistakes\r\nby fixing the guilt where it belonged, drove him on again, and he said:\r\n\r\n"Like many another woman before you, you are trying to shield a guilty\r\nman at your own expense. But it is useless, Miss Oliver; the truth\r\nalways comes to light. Be advised, then, and make a confidant of one who\r\nunderstands you better than you think."\r\n\r\nBut she would not listen to this.\r\n\r\n"No one understands me. I do not understand myself. I only know that I\r\nshall make a confidant of no one; that I shall never speak." And turning\r\nfrom him, she buried her head in the bedclothes.\r\n\r\nTo most men her tone and the action which accompanied it would have been\r\nfinal. But Mr. Gryce possessed great patience. Waiting for just a moment\r\ntill she seemed more composed, he murmured gently:\r\n\r\n"Not if you must suffer more from your silence than from speaking? Not\r\nif men--I do not mean myself, child, for I am your friend--will think\r\nthat _you_ are to blame for the death of the woman whom you saw fall\r\nunder a cruel stab, and whose rings you have?"\r\n\r\n"_I!_" Her horror was unmistakable; so were her surprise, her terror,\r\nand her shame, but she added nothing to the word she had uttered, and he\r\nwas forced to say again:\r\n\r\n"The world, and by that I mean both good people and bad, will believe\r\nall this. _He_ will let them believe all this. Men have not the devotion\r\nof women."\r\n\r\n"Alas! alas!" It was a murmur rather than a cry, and she trembled so the\r\nbed shook visibly under her. But she made no response to the entreaty in\r\nhis look and gesture, and he was compelled to draw back unsatisfied.\r\n\r\nWhen a few heavy minutes had passed, he spoke again, this time in a tone\r\nof sadness.\r\n\r\n"Few men are worth such sacrifices, Miss Oliver, and a criminal never.\r\nBut a woman is not moved by that thought. She should be moved by this,\r\nhowever. If either of these brothers is to blame in this matter,\r\nconsideration for the guiltless one should lead you to mention the name\r\nof the guilty."\r\n\r\nBut even this did not visibly affect her.\r\n\r\n"I shall mention no names," said she.\r\n\r\n"A sign will answer."\r\n\r\n"I shall make no sign."\r\n\r\n"Then Howard must go to his trial?"\r\n\r\nA gasp, but no words.\r\n\r\n"And Franklin proceed on his way undisturbed?"\r\n\r\nShe tried not to answer, but the words would come. Pray God! I may never\r\nsee such a struggle again.\r\n\r\n"That is as God wills. I can do nothing in the matter." And she sank\r\nback crushed and wellnigh insensible.\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce made no further effort to influence her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV.\r\n\r\nEXACTLY HALF-PAST THREE.\r\n\r\n\r\n"She is more unfortunate than wicked," was Mr. Gryce\'s comment as we\r\nstepped into the hall. "Nevertheless, watch her closely, for she is in\r\njust the mood to do herself a mischief. In an hour, or at the most two,\r\nI shall have a woman here to help you. You can stay till then?"\r\n\r\n"All night, if you say so."\r\n\r\n"That you must settle with Miss Althorpe. As soon as Miss Oliver is up I\r\nshall have a little scheme to propose, by means of which I hope to\r\narrive at the truth of this affair. I must know which of these two men\r\nshe is shielding."\r\n\r\n"Then you think she did not kill Mrs. Van Burnam herself?"\r\n\r\n"I think the whole matter one of the most puzzling mysteries that has\r\never come to the notice of the New York police. We are sure that the\r\nmurdered woman was Mrs. Van Burnam, that this girl was present at her\r\ndeath, and that she availed herself of the opportunity afforded by that\r\ndeath to make the exchange of clothing which has given such a\r\ncomplicated twist to the whole affair. But beyond these facts, we know\r\nlittle more than that it was Franklin Van Burnam who took her to the\r\nGramercy Park house, and Howard who was seen in that same vicinity some\r\ntwo or four hours later. But on which of these two to fix the\r\nresponsibility of Mrs. Van Burnam\'s death, is the question."\r\n\r\n"She had a hand in it herself," I persisted; "though it may have been\r\nwithout evil intent. No man ever carried that thing through without\r\nfeminine help. To this opinion I shall stick, much as this girl draws\r\nupon my sympathies."\r\n\r\n"I shall not try to persuade you to the contrary. But the point is to\r\nfind out how much help, and to whom it was given."\r\n\r\n"And your scheme for doing this?"\r\n\r\n"Cannot be carried out till she is on her feet again. So cure her, Miss\r\nButterworth, cure her. When she can go down-stairs, Ebenezer Gryce will\r\nbe on the scene to test his little scheme."\r\n\r\nI promised to do what I could, and when he was gone, I set diligently to\r\nwork to soothe the child, as he had called her, and get her in trim for\r\nthe delicate meal which had been sent up. And whether it was owing to a\r\nchange in my own feelings, or whether the talk with Mr. Gryce had so\r\nunnerved her that any womanly ministration was welcome, she responded\r\nmuch more readily to my efforts than ever before, and in a little while\r\nlay in so calm and grateful a mood that I was actually sorry to see the\r\nnurse when she came. Hoping that something might spring from an\r\ninterview with Miss Althorpe whereby my departure from the house might\r\nbe delayed, I descended to the library, and was fortunate enough to find\r\nthe mistress of the house there. She was sorting invitations, and looked\r\nanxious and worried.\r\n\r\n"You see me in a difficulty, Miss Butterworth. I had relied on Miss\r\nOliver to oversee this work, as well as to assist me in a great many\r\nother details, and I don\'t know of any one whom I can get on short\r\nnotice to take her place. My own engagements are many and----"\r\n\r\n"Let me help you," I put in, with that cheerfulness her presence\r\ninvariably inspires. "I have nothing pressing calling me home, and for\r\nonce in my life I should like to take an active part in wedding\r\nfestivities. It would make me feel quite young again."\r\n\r\n"But----" she began.\r\n\r\n"Oh," I hastened to say, "you think I would be more of a hindrance to\r\nyou than a help; that I would do the work, perhaps, but in my own way\r\nrather than in yours. Well, that would doubtless have been true of me a\r\nmonth since, but I have learned a great deal in the last few weeks,--you\r\nwill not ask me how,--and now I stand ready to do your work in your way,\r\nand to take a great deal of pleasure in it too."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Miss Butterworth," she exclaimed, with a burst of genuine feeling\r\nwhich I would not have lost for the world, "I always knew that you had a\r\nkind heart; and I am going to accept your offer in the same spirit in\r\nwhich it is made."\r\n\r\nSo that was settled, and with it the possibility of my spending another\r\nnight in this house.\r\n\r\nAt ten o\'clock I stole away from the library and the delightful company\r\nof Mr. Stone, who had insisted upon sharing my labors, and went up to\r\nMiss Oliver\'s room. I met the nurse at the door.\r\n\r\n"You want to see her," said she. "She\'s asleep, but does not rest very\r\neasily. I don\'t think I ever saw so pitiful a case. She moans\r\ncontinually, but not with physical pain. Yet she seems to have courage\r\ntoo; for now and then she starts up with a loud cry. Listen."\r\n\r\nI did so, and this is what I heard:\r\n\r\n"I do not want to live; doctor, I do not want to live; why do you try to\r\nmake me better?"\r\n\r\n"That is what she is saying all the time. Sad, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nI acknowledged it to be so, but at the same time wondered if the girl\r\nwere not right in wishing for death as a relief from her troubles.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning I inquired at her door again. Miss Oliver was\r\nbetter. Her fever had left her, and she wore a more natural look than at\r\nany time since I had seen her. But it was not an untroubled one, and it\r\nwas with difficulty I met her eyes when she asked if they were coming\r\nfor her that day, and if she could see Miss Althorpe before she left. As\r\nshe was not yet able to leave her bed I could easily answer her first\r\nquestion, but I knew too little of Mr. Gryce\'s intentions to be able to\r\nreply to the second. But I was easy with this suffering woman, very\r\neasy, more easy than I ever supposed I could be with any one so\r\nintimately associated with crime.\r\n\r\nShe seemed to accept my explanations as readily as she already had my\r\npresence, and I was struck again with surprise as I considered that my\r\nname had never aroused in her the least emotion.\r\n\r\n"Miss Althorpe has been so good to me I should like to thank her; from\r\nmy despairing heart, I should like to thank her," she said to me as I\r\nstood by her side before leaving. "Do you know"--she went on, catching\r\nme by the dress as I was turning away--"what kind of a man she is going\r\nto marry? She has such a loving heart, and marriage is such a fearful\r\nrisk."\r\n\r\n"Fearful?" I repeated.\r\n\r\n"Is it not fearful? To give one\'s whole soul to a man and be met by--I\r\nmust not talk of it; I must not think of it--But is he a good man? Does\r\nhe love Miss Althorpe? Will she be happy? I have no right to ask,\r\nperhaps, but my gratitude towards her is such that I wish her every joy\r\nand pleasure."\r\n\r\n"Miss Althorpe has chosen well," I rejoined. "Mr. Stone is a man in ten\r\nthousand."\r\n\r\nThe sigh that answered me went to my heart.\r\n\r\n"I will pray for her," she murmured; "that will be something to live\r\nfor."\r\n\r\nI did not know what reply to make to this. Everything which this girl\r\nsaid and did was so unexpected and so convincing in its sincerity, I\r\nfelt moved by her even against my better judgment. I pitied her and yet\r\nI dared not urge her on to speak, lest I should fail in my task of\r\nmaking her well. I therefore confined myself to a few haphazard\r\nexpressions of sympathy and encouragement, and left her in the hands of\r\nthe nurse.\r\n\r\nNext day Mr. Gryce called.\r\n\r\n"Your patient is better," said he.\r\n\r\n"Much better," was my cheerful reply. "This afternoon she will be able\r\nto leave the house."\r\n\r\n"Very good; have her down at half-past three and I will be in front with\r\na carriage."\r\n\r\n"I dread it," I cried; "but I will have her there."\r\n\r\n"You are beginning to like her, Miss Butterworth. Take care! You will\r\nlose your head if your sympathies become engaged."\r\n\r\n"It sits pretty firmly on my shoulders yet," I retorted; "and as for\r\nsympathies, you are full of them yourself. I saw how you looked at her\r\nyesterday."\r\n\r\n"Bah, _my_ looks!"\r\n\r\n"You cannot deceive me, Mr. Gryce; you are as sorry for the girl as you\r\ncan be; and so am I too. By the way, I do not think I should speak of\r\nher as a girl. From something she said yesterday I am convinced she is a\r\nmarried woman; and that her husband----"\r\n\r\n"Well, madam?"\r\n\r\n"I will not give him a name, at least not before your scheme has been\r\ncarried out. Are you ready for the undertaking?"\r\n\r\n"I will be this afternoon. At half-past three she is to leave the house.\r\nNot a minute before and not a minute later. Remember."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV.\r\n\r\nA RUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a new thing for me to enter into any scheme blindfold. But the\r\npast few weeks had taught me many lessons and among them to trust a\r\nlittle in the judgment of others.\r\n\r\nAccordingly I was on hand with my patient at the hour designated, and,\r\nas I supported her trembling steps down the stairs, I endeavored not to\r\nbetray the intense interest agitating me, or to awaken by my curiosity\r\nany further dread in her mind than that involved by her departure from\r\nthis home of bounty and good feeling, and her entrance upon an unknown\r\nand possibly much to be apprehended future.\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce was awaiting us in the lower hall, and as he caught sight of\r\nher slender figure and anxious face his whole attitude became at once so\r\nprotecting and so sympathetic, I did not wonder at her failure to\r\nassociate him with the police.\r\n\r\nAs she stepped down to his side he gave her a genial nod.\r\n\r\n"I am glad to see you so far on the road to recovery," he remarked. "It\r\nshows me that my prophecy is correct and that in a few days you will be\r\nquite yourself again."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him wistfully.\r\n\r\n"You seem to know so much about me, doctor, perhaps you can tell me\r\nwhere they are going to take me."\r\n\r\nHe lifted a tassel from a curtain near by, looked at it, shook his head\r\nat it, and inquired quite irrelevantly:\r\n\r\n"Have you bidden good-bye to Miss Althorpe?"\r\n\r\nHer eyes stole towards the parlors and she whispered as if half in awe\r\nof the splendor everywhere surrounding her:\r\n\r\n"I have not had the opportunity. But I should be sorry to go without a\r\nword of thanks for her goodness. Is she at home?"\r\n\r\nThe tassel slipped from his hand.\r\n\r\n"You will find her in a carriage at the door. She has an engagement out\r\nthis afternoon, but wishes to say good-bye to you before leaving."\r\n\r\n"Oh, how kind she is!" burst from the girl\'s white lips; and with a\r\nhurried gesture she was making for the door when Mr. Gryce stepped\r\nbefore her and opened it.\r\n\r\nTwo carriages were drawn up in front, neither of which seemed to possess\r\nthe elegance of so rich a woman\'s equipage. But Mr. Gryce appeared\r\nsatisfied, and pointing to the nearest one, observed quietly:\r\n\r\n"You are expected. If she does not open the carriage door for you, do\r\nnot hesitate to do it yourself. She has something of importance to say\r\nto you."\r\n\r\nMiss Oliver looked surprised, but prepared to obey him. Steadying\r\nherself by the stone balustrade, she slowly descended the steps and\r\nadvanced towards the carriage. I watched her from the doorway and Mr.\r\nGryce from the vestibule. It seemed an ordinary situation, but\r\nsomething in the latter\'s face convinced me that interests of no small\r\nmoment depended upon the interview about to take place.\r\n\r\nBut before I could decide upon their nature or satisfy myself as to the\r\nfull meaning of Mr. Gryce\'s manner, she had started back from the\r\ncarriage door and was saying to him in a tone of modest embarrassment:\r\n\r\n"There is a gentleman in the carriage; you must have made some mistake."\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce, who had evidently expected a different result from his\r\nstratagem, hesitated for a moment, during which I felt that he read her\r\nthrough and through; then he responded lightly:\r\n\r\n"I made a mistake, eh? Oh, possibly. Look in the other carriage, my\r\nchild."\r\n\r\nWith an unaffected air of confidence she turned to do so, and I turned\r\nto watch her, for I began to understand the "scheme" at which I was\r\nassisting, and foresaw that the emotion she had failed to betray at the\r\ndoor of the first carriage might not necessarily be lacking on the\r\nopening of the second.\r\n\r\nI was all the more assured of this from the fact that Miss Althorpe\'s\r\nstately figure was very plainly to be seen at that moment, not in the\r\ncoach Miss Oliver was approaching, but in an elegant victoria just\r\nturning the corner.\r\n\r\nMy expectations were realized; for no sooner had the poor girl swung\r\nopen the door of the second hack, than her whole body succumbed to a\r\nshock so great that I expected to see her fall in a heap on the\r\npavement. But she steadied herself up with a determined effort, and with\r\na sudden movement full of subdued fury, jumped into the carriage and\r\nviolently shut the door just as the first carriage drove off to give\r\nplace to Miss Althorpe\'s turn-out.\r\n\r\n"Humph!" sprang from Mr. Gryce\'s lips in a tone so full of varied\r\nemotions that it was with difficulty I refrained from rushing down the\r\nstoop to see for myself who was the occupant of the coach into which my\r\nlate patient had so passionately precipitated herself. But the sight of\r\nMiss Althorpe being helped to the ground by her attendant lover,\r\nrecalled me so suddenly to my own anomalous position on her stoop, that\r\nI let my first impulse pass and concerned myself instead with the\r\nformation of those apologies I thought necessary to the occasion. But\r\nthose apologies were never uttered. Mr. Gryce, with the infinite tact he\r\ndisplays in all serious emergencies, came to my rescue, and so\r\ndistracted Miss Althorpe\'s attention that she failed to observe that she\r\nhad interrupted a situation of no small moment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the coach containing Miss Oliver had, at a signal from the\r\nwary detective, drawn off in the wake of the first one, and I had the\r\ndoubtful satisfaction of seeing them both roll down the street without\r\nmy having penetrated the secret of either.\r\n\r\nA glance from Mr. Stone, who had followed Miss Althorpe up the stoop,\r\ninterrupted Mr. Gryce\'s flow of eloquence, and a few minutes later I\r\nfound myself making those adieux which I had hoped to avoid by departing\r\nin Miss Althorpe\'s absence. Another instant and I was hastening down the\r\nstreet in the direction taken by the two carriages, one of which had\r\npaused at the corner a few rods off.\r\n\r\nBut, spry as I am for one of my settled habits and sedate character, I\r\nfound myself passed by Mr. Gryce; and when I would have accelerated my\r\nsteps, he darted forward quite like a boy and, without a word of\r\nexplanation or any acknowledgment of the mutual understanding which\r\ncertainly existed between us, leaped into the carriage I was endeavoring\r\nto reach, and was driven away. But not before I caught a glimpse of Miss\r\nOliver\'s gray dress inside.\r\n\r\nDetermined not to be baffled by this man, I turned about and followed\r\nthe other carriage. It was approaching a crowded part of the avenue, and\r\nin a few minutes I had the gratification of seeing it come to a\r\nstandstill only a few feet from the curb-stone. The opportunity thus\r\nafforded me of satisfying my curiosity was not to be slighted. Without\r\npausing to consider consequences or to question the propriety of my\r\nconduct, I stepped boldly up in front of its half-lowered window and\r\nlooked in. There was but one person inside, and that person was Franklin\r\nVan Burnam.\r\n\r\nWhat was I to conclude from this? That the occupant of the other\r\ncarriage was Howard, and that Mr. Gryce now knew with which of the two\r\nbrothers Miss Oliver\'s memories were associated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOOK IV._\r\n\r\nTHE END OF A GREAT MYSTERY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE RESULT.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was as much surprised at this result of Mr. Gryce\'s scheme as he was,\r\nand possibly I was more chagrined. But I shall not enter into my\r\nfeelings on the subject, or weary you any further with my conjectures.\r\nYou will be much more interested, I know, in learning what occurred to\r\nMr. Gryce upon entering the carriage holding Miss Oliver.\r\n\r\nHe had expected, from the intense emotion she displayed at the sight of\r\nHoward Van Burnam (for I was not mistaken as to the identity of the\r\nperson occupying the carriage with her), to find her flushed with the\r\npassions incident upon this meeting, and her companion in a condition of\r\nmind which would make it no longer possible for him to deny his\r\nconnection with this woman and his consequently guilty complicity in a\r\nmurder to which both were linked by so many incriminating circumstances.\r\n\r\nBut for all his experience, the detective was disappointed in this\r\nexpectation, as he had been in so many others connected with this case.\r\nThere was nothing in Miss Oliver\'s attitude to indicate that she had\r\nunburdened herself of any of the emotions with which she was so\r\ngrievously agitated, nor was there on Mr. Van Burnam\'s part any deeper\r\nmanifestation of feeling than a slight glow on his cheek, and even that\r\ndisappeared under the detective\'s scrutiny, leaving him as composed and\r\nimperturbable as he had been in his memorable inquisition before the\r\nCoroner.\r\n\r\nDisappointed, and yet in a measure exhilarated by this sudden check in\r\nplans he had thought too well laid for failure, Mr. Gryce surveyed the\r\nyoung girl more carefully, and saw that he had not been mistaken in\r\nregard to the force or extent of the feelings which had driven her into\r\nMr. Van Burnam\'s presence; and turning back to that gentleman, was about\r\nto give utterance to some very pertinent remarks, when he was\r\nforestalled by Mr. Van Burnam inquiring, in his old calm way, which\r\nnothing seemed able to disturb:\r\n\r\n"Who is this crazy girl you have forced upon me? If I had known I was to\r\nbe subjected to such companionship I should not have regarded my outing\r\nso favorably."\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce, who never allowed himself to be surprised by anything a\r\nsuspected criminal might do or say, surveyed him quietly for a moment,\r\nthen turned towards Miss Oliver.\r\n\r\n"You hear what this gentleman calls you?" said he.\r\n\r\nHer face was hidden by her hands, but she dropped them as the detective\r\naddressed her, showing a countenance so distorted by passion that it\r\nstopped the current of his thoughts, and made him question whether the\r\nepithet bestowed upon her by their somewhat callous companion was\r\nentirely unjustified. But soon the something else which was in her face\r\nrestored his confidence in her sanity, and he saw that while her reason\r\nmight be shaken it was not yet dethroned, and that he had good cause to\r\nexpect sooner or later some action from a woman whose misery could wear\r\nan aspect of such desperate resolution.\r\n\r\nThat he was not the only one affected by the force and desperate\r\ncharacter of her glance became presently apparent, for Mr. Van Burnam,\r\nwith a more kindly tone than he had previously used, observed quietly:\r\n\r\n"I see the lady is suffering. I beg pardon for my inconsiderate words. I\r\nhave no wish to insult the unhappy."\r\n\r\nNever was Mr. Gryce so nonplussed. There was a mingled courtesy and\r\ncomposure in the speaker\'s manner which was as far removed as possible\r\nfrom that strained effort at self-possession which marks suppressed\r\npassion or secret fear; while in the vacant look with which she met\r\nthese words there was neither anger nor scorn nor indeed any of the\r\npassions one would expect to see there. The detective consequently did\r\nnot force the situation, but only watched her more and more attentively\r\ntill her eyes fell and she crouched away from them both. Then he said:\r\n\r\n"You can name this gentleman, can you not, Miss Oliver, even if he does\r\nnot choose to recognize _you_?"\r\n\r\nBut her answer, if she made one, was inaudible, and the sole result\r\nwhich Mr. Gryce obtained from this venture was a quick look from Mr. Van\r\nBurnam and the following uncompromising words from his lips:\r\n\r\n"If you think this young girl knows me, or that I know her, you are\r\ngreatly mistaken. She is as much of a stranger to me as I am to her,\r\nand I take this opportunity of saying so. I hope my liberty and good\r\nname are not to be made dependent upon the word of a miserable waif like\r\nthis."\r\n\r\n"Your liberty and your good name will depend upon your innocence,"\r\nretorted Mr. Gryce, and said no more, feeling himself at a disadvantage\r\nbefore the imperturbability of this man and the silent, non-accusing\r\nattitude of this woman, from the shock of whose passions he had\r\nanticipated so much and obtained so little.\r\n\r\nMeantime they were moving rapidly towards Police Headquarters, and\r\nfearing that the sight of that place might alarm Miss Oliver more than\r\nwas well for her, he strove again to rouse her by a kindly word or so.\r\nBut it was useless. She evidently tried to pay attention and follow the\r\nwords he used, but her thoughts were too busy over the one great subject\r\nthat engrossed her.\r\n\r\n"A bad case!" murmured Mr. Van Burnam, and with the phrase seemed to\r\ndismiss all thought of her.\r\n\r\n"A bad case!" echoed Mr. Gryce, "but," seeing how fast the look of\r\nresolution was replacing her previous aspect of frenzy, "one that will\r\ndo mischief yet to the man who has deceived her."\r\n\r\nThe stopping of the carriage roused her. Looking up, she spoke for the\r\nfirst time.\r\n\r\n"I want a police officer," she said.\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce, with all his assurance restored, leaped to the ground and\r\nheld out his hand.\r\n\r\n"I will take you into the presence of one," said he; and she, without a\r\nglance at Mr. Van Burnam, whose knee she brushed in passing, leaped to\r\nthe ground, and turned her face towards Police Headquarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII.\r\n\r\n"TWO WEEKS!"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut before she was well in, her countenance changed.\r\n\r\n"No," said she, "I want to think first. Give me time to think. I dare\r\nnot say a word without thinking."\r\n\r\n"Truth needs no consideration. If you wish to denounce this man----"\r\n\r\nHer look said she did.\r\n\r\n"Then now is the time."\r\n\r\nShe gave him a sharp glance; the first she had bestowed upon him since\r\nleaving Miss Althorpe\'s.\r\n\r\n"You are no doctor," she declared. "Are you a police-officer?"\r\n\r\n"I am a detective."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" and she hesitated for a moment, shrinking from him with very\r\nnatural distrust and aversion. "I have been in the toils then without\r\nknowing it; no wonder I am caught. But I am no criminal, sir; and if you\r\nare the one most in authority here, I beg the privilege of a few words\r\nwith you before I am put into confinement."\r\n\r\n"I will take you before the Superintendent," said Mr. Gryce. "But do you\r\nwish to go alone? Shall not Mr. Van Burnam accompany you?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Van Burnam?"\r\n\r\n"Is it not he you wish to denounce?"\r\n\r\n"I do not wish to denounce any one to-day."\r\n\r\n"What do you wish?" asked Mr. Gryce.\r\n\r\n"Let me see the man who has power to hold me here or let me go, and I\r\nwill tell him."\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Mr. Gryce, and led her into the presence of the\r\nSuperintendent.\r\n\r\nShe was at this moment quite a different person from what she had been\r\nin the carriage. All that was girlish in her aspect or appealing in her\r\nbearing had faded away, evidently forever, and left in its place\r\nsomething at once so desperate and so deadly, that she seemed not only a\r\nwoman but one of a very determined and dangerous nature. Her manner,\r\nhowever, was quiet, and it was only in her eye that one could see how\r\nnear she was to frenzy.\r\n\r\nShe spoke before the Superintendent could address her.\r\n\r\n"Sir," said she, "I have been brought here on account of a fearful crime\r\nI was unhappy enough to witness. I myself am innocent of that crime,\r\nbut, so far as I know, there is no other person living save the guilty\r\nman who committed it, who can tell you how or why or by whom it was\r\ndone. One man has been arrested for it and another has not. If you will\r\ngive me two weeks of complete freedom, I will point out to you which is\r\nthe veritable man of blood, and may Heaven have mercy on his soul!"\r\n\r\n"She is mad," signified the Superintendent in by-play to Mr. Gryce.\r\n\r\nBut the latter shook his head; she was not mad yet.\r\n\r\n"I know," she continued, without a hint of the timidity which seemed\r\nnatural to her under other circumstances, "that this must seem a\r\npresumptuous request from one like me, but it is only by granting it\r\nthat you will ever be able to lay your hand on the murderer of Mrs. Van\r\nBurnam. For I will never speak if I cannot speak in my own way and at my\r\nown time. The agonies I have suffered must have some compensation.\r\nOtherwise I should die of horror and my grief."\r\n\r\n"And how do you hope to gain compensation by this delay?" expostulated\r\nthe Superintendent. "Would you not meet with more satisfaction in\r\ndenouncing him here and now before he can pass another night in fancied\r\nsecurity?"\r\n\r\nBut she only repeated: "I have said two weeks, and two weeks I must\r\nhave. Two weeks in which to come and go as I please. Two weeks!" And no\r\nargument they could advance succeeded in eliciting from her any other\r\nresponse or in altering in any way her air of quiet determination with\r\nits underlying suggestion of frenzy.\r\n\r\nAcknowledging their mutual defeat by a look, the Superintendent and\r\ndetective drew off to one side, and something like the following\r\nconversation took place between them.\r\n\r\n"You think she\'s sane?"\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"And will remain so two weeks?"\r\n\r\n"If humored."\r\n\r\n"You are sure she is implicated in this crime?"\r\n\r\n"She was a witness to it."\r\n\r\n"And that she speaks the truth when she declares that she is the only\r\nperson who can point out the criminal?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; that is, she is the only one who will do it. The attitude taken by\r\nthe Van Burnams, especially by Howard just now in the presence of this\r\ngirl, shows how little we have to expect from them."\r\n\r\n"Yet you think they know as much as she does about it?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know what to think. For once I am baffled, Superintendent.\r\nEvery passion which this woman possesses was roused by her unexpected\r\nmeeting with Howard Van Burnam, and yet their indifference when\r\nconfronted, as well as her present action, seems to argue a lack of\r\nconnection between them which overthrows at once the theory of his\r\nguilt. Was it the sight of Franklin, then, which really affected her?\r\nand was her apparent indifference at meeting him only an evidence of her\r\nself-control? It seems an impossible conclusion to draw, and indeed\r\nthere are nothing but hitches and improbable features in this case.\r\nNothing fits; nothing jibes. I get just so far in it and then I run up\r\nagainst a wall. Either there is a superhuman power of duplicity in the\r\npersons who contrived this murder or we are on the wrong tack\r\naltogether."\r\n\r\n"In other words, you have tried every means known to you to get at the\r\ntruth of this matter, and failed."\r\n\r\n"I have, sir; sorry as I may be to acknowledge it."\r\n\r\n"Then we must accept her terms. She can be shadowed?"\r\n\r\n"Every moment."\r\n\r\n"Very well, then. Extreme cases must be met by extreme measures. We will\r\nlet her have her swing, and see what comes of it. Revenge is a great\r\nweapon in the hands of a determined woman, and from her look I think she\r\nwill make the most of it."\r\n\r\nAnd returning to where the young girl stood, the Superintendent asked\r\nher whether she felt sure the murderer would not escape in the time that\r\nmust elapse before his apprehension.\r\n\r\nInstantly her cheek, which had looked as if it could never show color\r\nagain, flushed a deep and painful scarlet, and she cried vehemently:\r\n\r\n"If any hint of what is here passing should reach him I should be\r\npowerless to prevent his flight. Swear, then, that my very existence\r\nshall be kept a secret between you two, or I will do nothing towards his\r\napprehension,--no, not even to save the innocent."\r\n\r\n"We will not swear, but we will promise," returned the Superintendent.\r\n"And now, when may we expect to hear from you again?"\r\n\r\n"Two weeks from to-night as the clock strikes eight. Be wherever I may\r\nchance to be at that hour, and see on whose arm I lay my hand. It will\r\nbe that of the man who killed Mrs. Van Burnam."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII.\r\n\r\nA WHITE SATIN GOWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe events just related did not come to my knowledge for some days after\r\nthey occurred, but I have recorded them at this time that I might in\r\nsome way prepare you for an interview which shortly after took place\r\nbetween myself and Mr. Gryce.\r\n\r\nI had not seen him since our rather unsatisfactory parting in front of\r\nMiss Althorpe\'s house, and the suspense which I had endured in the\r\ninterim made my greeting unnecessarily warm. But he took it all very\r\nnaturally.\r\n\r\n"You are glad to see me," said he; "been wondering what has become of\r\nMiss Oliver. Well, she is in good hands; with Mrs. Desberger, in short;\r\na woman whom I believe you know."\r\n\r\n"With Mrs. Desberger?" I _was_ surprised. "Why, I have been looking\r\nevery day in the papers for an account of her arrest."\r\n\r\n"No doubt," he answered. "But we police are slow; we are not ready to\r\narrest her yet. Meanwhile you can do us a favor. She wants to see you;\r\nare you willing to visit her?"\r\n\r\nMy answer contained but little of the curiosity and eagerness I really\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\n"I am always at your command. Do you wish me to go now?"\r\n\r\n"Miss Oliver is impatient," he admitted. "Her fever is better, but she\r\nis in an excited condition of mind which makes her a little\r\nunreasonable. To be plain, she is not quite herself, and while we still\r\nhope something from her testimony, we are leaving her very much to her\r\nown devices, and do not cross her in anything. You will therefore listen\r\nto what she says, and, if possible, aid her in anything she may\r\nundertake, unless it points directly towards self-destruction. My\r\nopinion is that she will surprise you. But you are becoming accustomed\r\nto surprises, are you not?"\r\n\r\n"Thanks to you, I am."\r\n\r\n"Very well, then, I have but one more suggestion to make. You are\r\nworking for the police now, madam, and nothing that you see or learn in\r\nconnection with this girl is to be kept back from us. Am I understood?"\r\n\r\n"Perfectly; but it is only proper for me to retort that I am not\r\nentirely pleased with the part you assign me. Could you not have left\r\nthus much to my good sense, and not put it into so many words?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, madam, the case at present is too serious for risks of that kind.\r\nMr. Van Burnam\'s reputation, to say nothing of his life, depends upon\r\nour knowledge of this girl\'s secret; surely you can stretch a point in a\r\nmatter of so much moment?"\r\n\r\n"I have already stretched several, and I can stretch one more, but I\r\nhope the girl won\'t look at me too often with those miserable appealing\r\neyes of hers; they make me feel like a traitor."\r\n\r\n"You will not be troubled by any appeal in them. The appeal has\r\nvanished; something harder and even more difficult to meet is to be\r\nfound in them now: wrath, purpose, and a desire for vengeance. She is\r\nnot the same woman, I assure you."\r\n\r\n"Well," I sighed, "I am sorry; there is something about the girl that\r\nlays hold of me, and I hate to see such a change in her. Did she ask for\r\nme by name?"\r\n\r\n"I believe so."\r\n\r\n"I cannot understand her wanting me, but I will go; and I won\'t leave\r\nher either till she shows me she is tired of me. I am as anxious to see\r\nthe end of this matter as you are." Then, with some vague idea that I\r\nhad earned a right to some show of confidence on his part, I added\r\ninsinuatingly: "I supposed you would feel the case settled when she\r\nalmost fainted at the sight of the younger Mr. Van Burnam."\r\n\r\nThe old ambiguous smile I remembered so well came to modify his brusque\r\nrejoinder.\r\n\r\n"If she had been a woman like you, I should; but she is a deep one, Miss\r\nButterworth; too deep for the success of a little ruse like mine. Are\r\nyou ready?"\r\n\r\nI was not, but it did not take me long to be so, and before an hour had\r\nelapsed I was seated in Mrs. Desberger\'s parlor in Ninth Street. Miss\r\nOliver was in, and ere long made her appearance. She was dressed in\r\nstreet costume.\r\n\r\nI was prepared for a change in her, and yet the shock I felt when I\r\nfirst saw her face must have been apparent, for she immediately\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n"You find me quite well, Miss Butterworth. For this I am partially\r\nindebted to you. You were very good to nurse me so carefully. Will you\r\nbe still kinder, and help me in a new matter which I feel quite\r\nincompetent to undertake alone?"\r\n\r\nHer face was flushed, her manner nervous, but her eyes had an\r\nextraordinary look in them which affected me most painfully,\r\nnotwithstanding the additional effect it gave to her beauty.\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said I. "What can I do for you?"\r\n\r\n"I wish to buy me a dress," was her unexpected reply. "A handsome dress.\r\nDo you object to showing me the best shops? I am a stranger in New\r\nYork."\r\n\r\nMore astonished than I can express, but carefully concealing it in\r\nremembrance of the caution received from Mr. Gryce, I replied that I\r\nwould be only too happy to accompany her on such an errand. Upon which\r\nshe lost her nervousness and prepared at once to go out with me.\r\n\r\n"I would have asked Mrs. Desberger," she observed while fitting on her\r\ngloves, "but her taste"--here she cast a significant look about the\r\nroom--"is not quiet enough for me."\r\n\r\n"I should think not!" I cried.\r\n\r\n"I shall be a trouble to you," the girl went on, with a gleam in her eye\r\nthat spoke of the restless spirit within. "I have many things to buy,\r\nand they must all be rich and handsome."\r\n\r\n"If you have money enough, there will be no trouble about that."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I have money." She spoke like a millionaire\'s daughter. "Shall we\r\ngo to Arnold\'s?"\r\n\r\nAs I always traded at Arnold\'s, I readily acquiesced, and we left the\r\nhouse. But not before she had tied a very thick veil over her face.\r\n\r\n"If we meet any one, do not introduce me," she begged. "I cannot talk to\r\npeople."\r\n\r\n"You may rest easy," I assured her.\r\n\r\nAt the corner she stopped. "Is there any way of getting a carriage?" she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"Do you want one?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nI signalled a hack.\r\n\r\n"Now for the dress!" she cried.\r\n\r\nWe rode at once to Arnold\'s.\r\n\r\n"What kind of a dress do you want?" I inquired as we entered the store.\r\n\r\n"An evening one; a white satin, I think."\r\n\r\nI could not help the exclamation which escaped me; but I covered it up\r\nas quickly as possible by a hurried remark in favor of white, and we\r\nproceeded at once to the silk counter.\r\n\r\n"I will trust it all to you," she whispered in an odd, choked tone as\r\nthe clerk approached us. "Get what you would for your daughter--no, no!\r\nfor Mr. Van Burnam\'s daughter, if he has one, and do not spare expense.\r\nI have five hundred dollars in my pocket."\r\n\r\nMr. Van Burnam\'s daughter! Well, well! A tragedy of some kind was\r\nportending! But I bought the dress.\r\n\r\n"Now," said she, "lace, and whatever else I need to make it up suitably.\r\nAnd I must have slippers and gloves. You know what a young girl requires\r\nto make her look like a lady. I want to look so well that the most\r\ncritical eye will detect no fault in my appearance. It can be done, can\r\nit not, Miss Butterworth? My face and figure will not spoil the effect,\r\nwill they?"\r\n\r\n"No," said I; "you have a good face and a beautiful figure. You ought to\r\nlook well. Are you going to a ball, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"I am going to a ball," she answered; but her tone was so strange the\r\npeople passing us turned to look at her.\r\n\r\n"Let us have everything sent to the carriage," said she, and went with\r\nme from counter to counter with her ready purse in her hand, but not\r\nonce lifting her veil to look at what was offered us, saying over and\r\nover as I sought to consult her in regard to some article: "Buy the\r\nrichest; I leave it all to you."\r\n\r\nHad Mr. Gryce not told me she must be humored, I could never have gone\r\nthrough this ordeal. To see a girl thus expend her hoarded savings on\r\nsuch frivolities was absolutely painful to me, and more than once I was\r\ntempted to decline any further participation in such extravagance. But a\r\nthought of my obligations to Mr. Gryce restrained me, and I went on\r\nspending the poor girl\'s dollars with more pain to myself than if I had\r\ntaken them out of my own pocket.\r\n\r\nHaving purchased all the articles we thought necessary, we were turning\r\ntowards the door when Miss Oliver whispered:\r\n\r\n"Wait for me in the carriage for just a few minutes. I have one more\r\nthing to buy, and I must do it alone."\r\n\r\n"But----" I began.\r\n\r\n"I will do it, and I will not be followed," she insisted, in a shrill\r\ntone that made me jump.\r\n\r\nAnd seeing no other way of preventing a scene, I let her leave me,\r\nthough it cost me an anxious fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nWhen she rejoined me, as she did at the expiration of that time, I eyed\r\nthe bundle she held with decided curiosity. But I could make no guess at\r\nits contents.\r\n\r\n"Now," she cried, as she reseated herself and closed the carriage door,\r\n"where shall I find a dressmaker able and willing to make up this satin\r\nin five days?"\r\n\r\nI could not tell her. But after some little search we succeeded in\r\nfinding a woman who engaged to make an elegant costume in the time given\r\nher. The first measurements were taken, and we drove back to Ninth\r\nStreet with a lasting memory in my mind of the cold and rigid form of\r\nMiss Oliver standing up in Madame\'s triangular parlor, submitting to the\r\nmechanical touches of the modiste with an outward composure, but with a\r\nbrooding horror in her eyes that bespoke an inward torment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE WATCHFUL EYE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I parted with Miss Oliver on Mrs. Desberger\'s stoop and did not visit\r\nher again in that house, I will introduce the report of a person better\r\nsituated than myself to observe the girl during the next few days. That\r\nthe person thus alluded to was a woman in the service of the police is\r\nevident, and as such may not meet with your approval, but her words are\r\nof interest, as witness:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Friday P.M.\r\n\r\n"Party went out to-day in company with an elderly female of respectable\r\nappearance. Said elderly female wears puffs, and moves with great\r\nprecision. I say this in case her identification should prove necessary.\r\n\r\n"I had been warned that Miss O. would probably go out, and as the man\r\nset to watch the front door was on duty, I occupied myself during her\r\nabsence in making a neat little hole in the partitions between our two\r\nrooms, so that I should not be obliged to offend my next-door neighbor\r\nby too frequent visits to her apartment. This done, I awaited her\r\nreturn, which was delayed till it was almost dark. When she did come in,\r\nher arms were full of bundles. These she thrust into a bureau-drawer,\r\nwith the exception of one, which she laid with great care under her\r\npillow. I wondered what this one could be, but could get no inkling from\r\nits size or shape. Her manner when she took off her hat was fiercer than\r\nbefore, and a strange smile, which I had not previously observed on her\r\nlips, added force to her expression. But it paled after supper-time, and\r\nshe had a restless night. I could hear her walk the floor long after I\r\nthought it prudent on my part to retire, and at intervals through the\r\nnight I was disturbed by her moaning, which was not that of a sick\r\nperson but of one very much afflicted in mind.\r\n\r\n"Saturday.\r\n\r\n"Party quiet. Sits most of the time with hands clasped on her knee\r\nbefore the fire. Given to quick starts as if suddenly awakened from an\r\nabsorbing train of thought. A pitiful object, especially when seized by\r\nterror as she is at odd times. No walks, no visitors to-day. Once I\r\nheard her speak some words in a strange language, and once she drew\r\nherself up before the mirror in an attitude of so much dignity I was\r\nsurprised at the fine appearance she made. The fire of her eyes at this\r\nmoment was remarkable. I should not be surprised at any move she might\r\nmake.\r\n\r\n"Sunday.\r\n\r\n"She has been writing to-day. But when she had filled several pages of\r\nletter paper she suddenly tore them all up and threw them into the fire.\r\nTime seems to drag with her, for she goes every few minutes to the\r\nwindow from which a distant church clock is visible, and sighs as she\r\nturns away. More writing in the evening and some tears. But the writing\r\nwas burned as before, and the tears stopped by a laugh that augurs\r\nlittle good to the person who called it up. The package has been taken\r\nfrom under her pillow and put in some place not visible from my\r\nspy-hole.\r\n\r\n"Monday.\r\n\r\n"Party out again to-day, gone some two hours or more. When she returned\r\nshe sat down before the mirror and began dressing her hair. She has fine\r\nhair, and she tried arranging it in several ways. None seemed to satisfy\r\nher, and she tore it down again and let it hang till supper-time, when\r\nshe wound it up in its usual simple knot. Mrs. Desberger spent some\r\nminutes with her, but their talk was far from confidential, and\r\ntherefore uninteresting. I wish people would speak louder when they talk\r\nto themselves.\r\n\r\n"Tuesday.\r\n\r\n"Great restlessness on the part of the young person I am watching. No\r\nquiet for her, no quiet for me, yet she accomplishes nothing, and as yet\r\nhas furnished me no clue to her thoughts.\r\n\r\n"A huge box was brought into the room to-night. It seemed to cause her\r\ndread rather than pleasure, for she shrank at sight of it, and has not\r\nyet attempted to open it. But her eyes have never left it since it was\r\nset down on the floor. It looks like a dressmaker\'s box, but why such\r\nemotion over a gown?\r\n\r\n"Wednesday.\r\n\r\n"This morning she opened the box but did not display its contents. I\r\ncaught one glimpse of a mass of tissue paper, and then she put the cover\r\non again, and for a good half hour sat crouching down beside it,\r\nshuddering like one in an ague-fit. I began to feel there was something\r\ndeadly in the box, her eyes wandered towards it so frequently and with\r\nsuch contradictory looks of dread and savage determination. When she\r\ngot up it was to see how many more minutes of the wretched day had\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n"Thursday.\r\n\r\n"Party sick; did not try to leave her bed. Breakfast brought up by Mrs.\r\nDesberger, who showed her every attention, but could not prevail upon\r\nher to eat. Yet she would not let the tray be taken away, and when she\r\nwas alone again or thought herself alone, she let her eyes rest so long\r\non the knife lying across her plate, that I grew nervous and could\r\nhardly restrain myself from rushing into the room. But I remembered my\r\ninstructions, and kept still even when I saw her hand steal towards this\r\npossible weapon, though I kept my own on the bell-rope which fortunately\r\nhung at my side. She looked quite capable of wounding herself with the\r\nknife, but after balancing it a moment in her hand, she laid it down\r\nagain and turned with a low moan to the wall. She will not attempt death\r\ntill she has accomplished what is in her mind.\r\n\r\n"Friday.\r\n\r\n"All is right in the next room; that is, the young lady is up; but there\r\nis another change in her appearance since last night. She has grown\r\ncontemptuous of herself and indulges less in brooding. But her\r\nimpatience at the slow passage of time continues, and her interest in\r\nthe box is even greater than before. She does not open it, however, only\r\nlooks at it and lays her trembling hand now and then on the cover.\r\n\r\n"Saturday.\r\n\r\n"A blank day. Party dull and very quiet. Her eyes begin to look like\r\nghastly hollows in her pale face. She talks to herself continually, but\r\nin a low mechanical way exceedingly wearing to the listener, especially\r\nas no word can be distinguished. Tried to see her in her own room\r\nto-day, but she would not admit me.\r\n\r\n"Sunday.\r\n\r\n"I have noticed from the first a Bible lying on one end of her\r\nmantel-shelf. To-day she noticed it also, and impulsively reached out\r\nher hand to take it down. But at the first word she read she gave a low\r\ncry and hastily closed the book and put it back. Later, however, she\r\ntook it again and read several chapters. The result was a softening in\r\nher manner, but she went to bed as flushed and determined as ever.\r\n\r\n"Monday.\r\n\r\n"She has walked the floor all day. She has seen no one, and seems\r\nscarcely able to contain her impatience. She cannot stand this long.\r\n\r\n"Tuesday.\r\n\r\n"My surprises began in the morning. As soon as her room had been put in\r\norder, Miss O. locked the door and began to open her bundles. First she\r\nunrolled a pair of white silk stockings, which she carefully, but\r\nwithout any show of interest, laid on the bed; then she opened a package\r\ncontaining gloves. They were white also, and evidently of the finest\r\nquality. Then a lace handkerchief was brought to light, slippers, an\r\nevening fan, and a pair of fancy pins, and lastly she opened the\r\nmysterious box and took out a dress so rich in quality and of such\r\nsimple elegance, it almost took my breath away. It was white, and made\r\nof the heaviest satin, and it looked as much out of place in that shabby\r\nroom as its owner did in the moments of exaltation of which I have\r\nspoken.\r\n\r\n"Though her face was flushed when she lifted out the gown, it became\r\npale again when she saw it lying across her bed. Indeed, a look of\r\npassionate abhorrence characterized her features as she contemplated it,\r\nand her hands went up before her eyes and she reeled back uttering the\r\nfirst words I have been able to distinguish since I have been on duty.\r\nThey were violent in character, and seemed to tear their way through her\r\nlips almost without her volition. \'It is hate I feel, nothing but hate.\r\nAh, if it were only duty that animated me!\'\r\n\r\n"Later she grew calmer, and covering up the whole paraphernalia with a\r\nstray sheet she had evidently laid by for the purpose, she sent for Mrs.\r\nDesberger. When that lady came in she met her with a wan but by no means\r\ndubious smile, and ignoring with quiet dignity the very evident\r\ncuriosity with which that good woman surveyed the bed, she said\r\nappealingly:\r\n\r\n"\'You have been so kind to me, Mrs. Desberger, that I am going to tell\r\nyou a secret. Will it continue to remain a secret, or shall I see it in\r\nthe faces of all my fellow-boarders to-morrow?\' You can imagine Mrs.\r\nDesberger\'s reply, also the manner in which it was delivered, but not\r\nMiss Oliver\'s secret. She uttered it in these words: \'I am going out\r\nto-night, Mrs. Desberger. I am going into great society. I am going to\r\nattend Miss Althorpe\'s wedding.\' Then, as the good woman stammered out\r\nsome words of surprise and pleasure, she went on to say: \'I do not want\r\nany one to know it, and I would be so glad if I could slip out of the\r\nhouse without any one seeing me. I shall need a carriage, but you will\r\nget one for me, will you not, and let me know the moment it comes. I am\r\nshy of what folks say, and besides, as you know, I am neither happy nor\r\nwell, if I do go to weddings, and have new dresses, and----\' She nearly\r\nbroke down but collected herself with wonderful promptitude, and with a\r\ncoaxing look that made her almost ghastly, so much it seemed out of\r\naccord with her strained and unnatural manner, she raised a corner of\r\nthe sheet, saying, \'I will show you my gown, if you will promise to help\r\nme quietly out of the house,\' which, of course, produced the desired\r\neffect upon Mrs. Desberger, that woman\'s greatest weakness being her\r\nlove of dress.\r\n\r\n"So from that hour I knew what to expect, and after sending\r\nprecautionary advices to Police Headquarters, I set myself to watch her\r\nprepare for the evening. I saw her arrange her hair and put on her\r\nelegant gown, and was as much startled by the result as if I had not had\r\nthe least premonition that she only needed rich clothes to look both\r\nbeautiful and distinguished. The square parcel she had once hidden under\r\nher pillow was brought out and laid on the bed, and when Mrs.\r\nDesberger\'s low knock announced the arrival of the carriage, she caught\r\nit up and hid it under the cloak she hastily threw about her. Mrs.\r\nDesberger came in and put out the light, but before the room sank into\r\ndarkness I caught one glimpse of Miss Oliver\'s face. Its expression was\r\nterrible beyond anything I had ever seen on any human countenance."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXL.\r\n\r\nAS THE CLOCK STRUCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not attend weddings in general, but great as my suspense was in\r\nreference to Miss Oliver, I felt that I could not miss seeing Miss\r\nAlthorpe married.\r\n\r\nI had ordered a new dress for the occasion, and was in the best of\r\nspirits as I rode to the church in which the ceremony was to be\r\nperformed. The excitement of a great social occasion was for once not\r\ndisagreeable to me, nor did I mind the crowd, though it pushed me about\r\nrather uncomfortably till an usher came to my assistance and seated me\r\nin a pew, which I was happy to see commanded a fine view of the chancel.\r\n\r\nI was early, but then I always am early, and having ample opportunity\r\nfor observation, I noted every fine detail of ornamentation with\r\napproval, Miss Althorpe\'s taste being of that fine order which always\r\nfalls short of ostentation. Her friends are in very many instances my\r\nfriends, and it was no small part of my pleasure to note their\r\nwell-known faces among the crowd of those that were strange to me. That\r\nthe scene was brilliant, and that silks, satins, and diamonds abounded,\r\ngoes without saying.\r\n\r\nAt last the church was full, and the hush which usually precedes the\r\ncoming of the bride was settling over the whole assemblage, when I\r\nsuddenly observed, in the person of a respectable-looking gentleman\r\nseated in a side pew, the form and features of Mr. Gryce, the detective.\r\nThis was a shock to me, yet what was there in his presence there to\r\nalarm me? Might not Miss Althorpe have accorded him this pleasure out of\r\nthe pure goodness of her heart? I did not look at anybody else, however,\r\nafter once my eyes fell upon him, but continued to watch his expression,\r\nwhich was non-commital, though a little anxious for one engaged in a\r\npurely social function.\r\n\r\nThe entrance of the clergyman and the sudden peal of the organ in the\r\nwell-known wedding march recalled my attention to the occasion itself,\r\nand as at that moment the bridegroom stepped from the vestry to await\r\nhis bride at the altar, I was absorbed by his fine appearance and the\r\nair of mingled pride and happiness with which he watched the stately\r\napproach of the bridal procession.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly there was a stir through the whole glittering assemblage,\r\nand the clergyman made a move and the bridegroom gave a start, and the\r\nsound, slight as it was, of moving feet grew still, and I saw advancing\r\nfrom the door on the opposite side of the altar a second bride, clad in\r\nwhite and surrounded by a long veil which completely hid her face. A\r\nsecond bride! and the first was half-way up the aisle, and only one\r\nbridegroom stood ready!\r\n\r\nThe clergyman, who seemed to have as little command of his faculties as\r\nthe rest of us, tried to speak; but the approaching woman, upon whom\r\nevery regard was fixed, forestalled him by an authoritative gesture.\r\n\r\nAdvancing towards the chancel, she took her place on the spot reserved\r\nfor Miss Althorpe.\r\n\r\nSilence had filled the church up to this moment; but at this audacious\r\nmove, a solitary wailing cry of mingled astonishment and despair went up\r\nbehind us; but before any of us could turn, and while my own heart stood\r\nstill, for I thought I recognized this veiled figure, the woman at the\r\naltar raised her hand and pointed towards the bridegroom.\r\n\r\n"Why does he hesitate?" she cried. "Does he not recognize the only woman\r\nwith whom he dare face God and man at the altar? Because I am already\r\nhis wedded wife, and have been so for five long years, does that make my\r\nwearing of this veil amiss when he a husband, unreleased by the law,\r\ndares enter this sacred place with the hope and expectation of a\r\nbridegroom?"\r\n\r\nIt was Ruth Oliver who spoke. I recognized her voice as I had recognized\r\nher apparel; but the emotions aroused in me by her presence and the\r\nalmost incredible claims she advanced were lost in the horror inspired\r\nby the man she thus vehemently accused. No lost spirit from the pit\r\ncould have shown a more hideous commingling of the most terrible\r\npassions known to man than he did in the face of this terrible\r\narraignment; and if Ella Althorpe, cowering in her shame and misery\r\nhalf-way up the aisle, saw him in all his depravity at that instant as I\r\ndid, nothing could have saved her long-cherished love from immediate\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nYet he tried to speak.\r\n\r\n"It is false!" he cried; "all false! The woman I once called wife is\r\ndead."\r\n\r\n"Dead, Olive Randolph? Murderer!" she exclaimed. "The blow struck in the\r\ndark found another victim!" And pulling the veil from her face, Ruth\r\nOliver advanced to his side and laid her trembling hand with a firm and\r\ndecisive movement on his arm.\r\n\r\nWas it her words, her touch, or the sound of the clock striking eight in\r\nthe great tower over our heads, which so totally overwhelmed him? As the\r\nlast stroke of the hour which was to have seen him united with Miss\r\nAlthorpe died out in the awed spaces above him, he gave a cry such as I\r\nam sure never resounded between those sacred walls before, and sank in a\r\nheap on the spot where but a few minutes previous he had lifted his head\r\nin all the glow and pride of a prospective bridegroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI.\r\n\r\nSECRET HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was hours before I found myself able to realize that the scene I had\r\njust witnessed had a deeper and much more dreadful significance than\r\nappeared to the general eye, and that Ruth Oliver, in her desperate\r\ninterruption of these treacherous nuptials, had not only made good her\r\nprior claim to Randolph Stone as her husband, but had pointed him out to\r\nall the world as the villainous author of that crime which for so long a\r\ntime had occupied my own and the public\'s attention.\r\n\r\nThinking that you may find the same difficulty in grasping this terrible\r\nfact, and being anxious to save you from the suspense under which I\r\nmyself labored for so many hours, I here subjoin a written statement\r\nmade by this woman some weeks later, in which the whole mystery is\r\nexplained. It is signed Olive Randolph; the name to which she evidently\r\nfeels herself best entitled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"The man known in New York City as Randolph Stone was first seen by me\r\nin Michigan five years ago. His name then was John Randolph, and how he\r\nhas since come to add to this the further appellation of Stone, I must\r\nleave to himself to explain.\r\n\r\n"I was born in Michigan myself, and till my eighteenth year I lived\r\nwith my father, who was a widower without any other child, in a little\r\nlow cottage amid the sand mounds that border the eastern side of the\r\nlake.\r\n\r\n"I was not pretty, but every man who passed me on the beach or in the\r\nstreets of the little town where we went to market and to church,\r\nstopped to look at me, and this I noticed, and from this perhaps my\r\nunhappiness arose.\r\n\r\n"For before I was old enough to know the difference between poverty and\r\nriches, I began to lose all interest in my simple home duties, and to\r\ncast longing looks at the great school building where girls like myself\r\nlearned to speak like ladies and play the piano. Yet these ambitious\r\npromptings might have come to nothing if I had never met _him_. I might\r\nhave settled down in my own sphere and lived a useful if unsatisfied\r\nlife like my mother and my mother\'s mother before her.\r\n\r\n"But fate had reserved me for wretchedness, and one day just as I was on\r\nthe verge of my eighteenth year, I saw John Randolph.\r\n\r\n"I was coming out of church when our eyes first met, and I noticed after\r\nthe first shock my simple heart received from his handsome face and\r\nelegant appearance, that he was surveying me with that strange look of\r\nadmiration I had seen before on so many faces; and the joy this gave me,\r\nand the certainty which came with it of my seeing him again, made that\r\nmoment quite unlike any other in my whole life, and was the beginning of\r\nthat passion which has undone me, ruined him, and brought death and\r\nsorrow to many others of more worth than either of us.\r\n\r\n"He was not a resident of the town, but a passing visitor; and his\r\nintention had been, as he has since told me, to leave the place on the\r\nfollowing day. But the dart which had pierced my breast had not glanced\r\nentirely aside from his, and he remained, as he declared, to see what\r\nthere was in this little country-girl\'s face to make it so\r\nunforgettable. We met first on the beach and afterwards under the strip\r\nof pines which separate our cottage from the sand mounds, and though I\r\nhave no reason to believe he came to these interviews with any honest\r\npurpose or deep sincerity of feeling, it is certain he exerted all his\r\npowers to make them memorable to me, and that, in doing so, he awoke\r\nsome of the fire in his own breast which he took such wicked pleasure in\r\narousing in mine.\r\n\r\n"In fact he soon showed that this was so, for I could take no step from\r\nthe house without encountering him; and the one indelible impression\r\nremaining to me from those days is the expression his face wore as, one\r\nsunny afternoon, he laid my hand on his arm and drew me away to have a\r\nlook at the lake booming on the beach below us. There was no love in it\r\nas I understand love now, but the passion which informed it almost\r\namounted to intoxication, and if such a passion can be understood\r\nbetween a man already cultivated and a girl who hardly knew how to read,\r\nit may, in a measure, account for what followed.\r\n\r\n"My father, who was no fool, and who saw the selfish quality in this\r\nattractive lover of mine, was alarmed by our growing intimacy. Taking an\r\nopportunity when we were both in a more sensible mood than common, he\r\nput the case before Mr. Randolph in a very decided way. He told him that\r\neither he must marry me at once or quit seeing me altogether. No delay\r\nwas to be considered and no compromise allowed.\r\n\r\n"As my father was a man with whom no one ever disputed, John Randolph\r\nprepared to leave the town, declaring that he could marry no one at that\r\nstage of his career. But before he could carry out his intention, the\r\nold intoxication returned, and he came back in a fever of love and\r\nimpatience to marry me.\r\n\r\n"Had I been older or more experienced in the ways of the world, I would\r\nhave known that such passion as this evinced was short-lived; that there\r\nis no witchery in a smile lasting enough to make men like him forget the\r\nlack of those social graces to which they are accustomed. But I was mad\r\nwith happiness, and was unconscious of any cloud lowering upon our\r\nfuture till the day of our first separation came, when an event occurred\r\nwhich showed me what I might expect if I could not speedily raise myself\r\nto his level.\r\n\r\n"We were out walking, and we met a lady who had known Mr. Randolph\r\nelsewhere. She was well dressed, which I was not, though I had not\r\nrealized it till I saw how attractive she looked in quiet colors and\r\nwith only a simple ribbon on her hat; and she had, besides, a way of\r\nspeaking which made my tones sound harsh, and robbed me of that feeling\r\nof superiority with which I had hitherto regarded all the girls of my\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\n"But it was not her possession of these advantages, keenly as I felt\r\nthem, which awakened me to the sense of my position. It was the surprise\r\nshe showed (a surprise the source of which was not to be mistaken) when\r\nhe introduced me to her as his wife; and though she recovered herself in\r\na moment, and tried to be kind and gracious, I felt the sting of it and\r\nsaw that he felt it too, and consequently was not at all astonished\r\nwhen, after she had passed us, he turned and looked at me critically for\r\nthe first time.\r\n\r\n"But his way of showing his dissatisfaction gave me a shock it took me\r\nyears to recover from. \'Take off that hat,\' he cried, and when I had\r\nobeyed him, he tore out the spray which to my eyes had been its chief\r\nadornment, and threw it into some bushes near by; then he gave me back\r\nthe hat and asked for the silk neckerchief which I had regarded as the\r\nglory of my bridal costume. Giving it to him I saw him put it in his\r\npocket, and understanding now that he was trying to make me look more\r\nlike the lady we had passed, I cried out passionately: \'It is not these\r\nthings that make the difference, John, but my voice and way of walking\r\nand speaking. Give me money and let me be educated, and then we will see\r\nif any other woman can draw your eyes away from me.\'\r\n\r\n"But he had received a shock that made him cruel. \'You cannot make a\r\nsilk purse out of a sow\'s ear,\' he sneered, and was silent all the rest\r\nof the way home. I was silent too, for I never talk when I am angry, but\r\nwhen we arrived in our own little room I confronted him.\r\n\r\n"\'Are you going to say any more such cruel things to me?\' I asked, \'for\r\nif you are, I should like you to say them now and be done with it.\'\r\n\r\n"He looked desperately angry, but there was yet a little love left in\r\nhis heart for me, for he laughed after he had looked at me for a minute,\r\nand took me in his arms and said some of the fine things with which he\r\nhad previously won my heart, but not with the old fire and not with the\r\nold effect upon me. Yet my love had not grown cold, it had only changed\r\nfrom the unthinking stage to the thinking one, and I was quite in\r\nearnest when I said: \'I know I am not as pretty or as nice as the ladies\r\nyou are accustomed to. But I have a heart that has never known any other\r\npassion than its love for you, and from such a heart you ought to expect\r\na lady to grow, and there will. Only give me the chance, John; only let\r\nme learn to read and write.\'\r\n\r\n"But he was in an incredulous state of mind, and it ended in his going\r\naway without making any arrangements for my education. He was bound for\r\nSan Francisco, where he had business to transact, and he promised to be\r\nback in four weeks, but before the four weeks elapsed, he wrote me that\r\nit would be five, and later on that it would be six, and afterwards that\r\nit would be when he had finished a big piece of work he was engaged\r\nupon, and which would bring him a large amount of money. I believed him\r\nand I doubted him at the same time, but I was not altogether sorry he\r\ndelayed his return for I had begun school on my own account and was fast\r\nlaying the foundation of a solid education.\r\n\r\n"My means came from my father, who, now it was too late, saw the\r\nnecessity of my improving myself. The amount of studying I did that\r\nfirst year was amazing, but it was nothing to what I went through the\r\nsecond, for my husband\'s letters had begun to fail me, and I was forced\r\nto work in order to drown grief and keep myself from despair. Finally no\r\nletters came at all, and when the second year was over, and I could at\r\nleast express myself correctly, I woke to the realization that, so far\r\nas my husband was concerned, I had gone through all this labor for\r\nnothing, and that unless by some fortunate chance I could light upon\r\nsome clue to his whereabouts in the great world beyond our little town,\r\nI would be likely to pass the remainder of my days in widowhood and\r\ndesolation.\r\n\r\n"My father dying at this time and leaving me a thousand dollars, I knew\r\nno better way of spending it than in the hopeless search I have just\r\nmentioned. Accordingly after his burial I started out on my travels,\r\ngaining experience with every mile. I had not been away a week before I\r\nrealized what a folly I had indulged in in ever hoping to see John\r\nRandolph back at my side. I saw the homes in which such men as he lived,\r\nand met in cars and on steamboats the kind of people with whom he must\r\nassociate to be happy, and a gulf seemed to open between us which even\r\nsuch love as mine would be powerless to bridge.\r\n\r\n"But though hope thus sank in my breast, I did not lose my old ambition\r\nof making myself as worthy of him as circumstances would permit. I read\r\nonly the best books and I allowed myself to become acquainted with only\r\nthe best people, and as I saw myself liked by such the awkwardness of my\r\nmanner gradually disappeared, and I began to feel that the day would\r\ncome when I should be universally recognized as a lady.\r\n\r\n"Meantime I did not advance an iota in the object of my journey; and at\r\nlast, with every expectation gone of ever seeing my husband again, I\r\nmade my way to Toledo. Here I speedily found employment, and what was\r\nbetter still to one of my ambitious tendencies, an opportunity to add to\r\nthe sum of my accomplishments a knowledge of French and music. The\r\nFrench I learned from the family I lived with, and the music from a\r\nprofessor in the same house whose love for his pet art was so great that\r\nhe found it simple happiness to impart it to one so greedy for\r\nimprovement as myself.\r\n\r\n"Here, in course of time, I also learned type-writing, and it was for\r\nthe purpose of seeking employment in this capacity that I finally came\r\nto New York. This was three months ago.\r\n\r\n"I was in complete ignorance of the city when I entered it, and for a\r\nday or two I wandered to and fro, searching for a suitable\r\nlodging-house. It was while I was on my way to Mrs. Desberger\'s that I\r\nsaw advancing towards me a gentleman in whose air and manner I detected\r\na resemblance to the husband who some five years since had deserted me.\r\nThe shock was too much for my self-control. Quaking in every limb, I\r\nstood awaiting his approach, and when he came up to me, and I saw by his\r\nstartled recognition of me that it was indeed he, I gave a loud cry and\r\nthrew myself upon his arm. The start he gave was nothing to the\r\nfrightful expression which crossed his face at this encounter, but I\r\nthought both due to his surprise, though now I am convinced they had\r\ntheir origin in the deepest and worst emotions of which a man is\r\ncapable.\r\n\r\n"\'John! John!\' I cried, and could say no more, for the agitations of\r\nfive solitary, despairing years were choking me; but he was entirely\r\nvoiceless, stricken, I have no doubt, beyond any power of mine to\r\nrealize. How could I dream that in consideration, power, and prestige he\r\nhad advanced even more rapidly than myself, and that at this very moment\r\nhe was not only the idol of society, but on the verge of uniting himself\r\nto a woman--I will not say of marrying her, for marry her he could not\r\nwhile I lived--who would make him the envied possessor of millions. Such\r\nfortune, such daring, yes and such depravity, were beyond the reach of\r\nmy imagination, and while I thought his pleasure less than mine, I did\r\nnot dream that my existence was a menace to all his hopes, and that\r\nduring this moment of speechlessness he was sounding his nature for\r\nmeans to rid himself of me even at the cost of my life.\r\n\r\n"His first movement was to push me away, but I clung to him all the\r\nharder; at which his whole manner changed and he began to make futile\r\nefforts to calm me and lead me away from the spot. Seeing that these\r\nattempts were unavailing, he turned pale and raised his arm up\r\npassionately, but speedily dropped it again, and casting glances this\r\nway and that, broke suddenly into a loud laugh and became, as by the\r\ntouch of a magician\'s wand, my old lover again.\r\n\r\n"\'Why, Olive!\' he cried; \'why, Olive! is it you? (Did I say my name was\r\nOlive?) Happily met, my dear! I did not know what I had been missing all\r\nthese years, but now I know it was you. Will you come with me, or shall\r\nI go home with you?\'\r\n\r\n"\'I have no home,\' said I, \'I have just come into town.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Then I see but one alternative.\' He smiled, and what a power there was\r\nin his smile when he chose to exert it! \'You must come to my apartments;\r\nare you willing?\'\r\n\r\n"\'I am your wife,\' I answered.\r\n\r\n"He had taken me on his arm by this time and the recoil he made at these\r\nwords was quite perceptible; but his face still smiled, and I was too\r\nmad with joy to be critical.\r\n\r\n"\'And a very pretty and charming wife you have become,\' said he, drawing\r\nme on for a few steps. Suddenly he paused, and I felt the old shadow\r\nfall between us again. \'But your dress is very shabby,\' he remarked.\r\n\r\n"It was not; it was not near as shabby as the linen duster he himself\r\nwore.\r\n\r\n"\'Is that rain?\' he inquired, looking up as a drop or two fell.\r\n\r\n"\'Yes, it is raining.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Very well, let us go into this store we are coming to and buy a\r\ngossamer. That will cover up your gown. I cannot take you to my house\r\ndressed as you are now.\'\r\n\r\n"Surprised, for I had thought my dress very neat and lady-like, but\r\nnever dreaming of questioning his taste any more than in the old days in\r\nMichigan, I went with him into the shop he had pointed out and bought me\r\na gossamer, for which he paid. When he had helped me to put it on and\r\nhad tied my veil well over my face, he seemed more at his ease and gave\r\nme his arm quite cheerfully.\r\n\r\n"\'Now,\' said he, \'you look well, but how about the time when you will\r\nhave to take the gossamer off? I tell you what it is, my dear, you will\r\nhave to refit yourself entirely before I shall be satisfied.\' And again\r\nI saw him cast about him that furtive and inquiring look which would\r\nhave awakened more surprise in me than it did had I known that we were\r\nin a part of the city where he ran but little chance of meeting any one\r\nhe knew.\r\n\r\n"\'This old duster I have on,\' he suddenly laughed, \'is a very\r\nappropriate companion to your gossamer,\' and though I did not agree with\r\nhim, for my clothes were new, and his old and shabby, I laughed also and\r\nnever dreamed of evil.\r\n\r\n"As this garment which so disfigured him that morning has been the\r\noccasion of much false speculation on the part of those whose business\r\nit was to inquire into the crime with which it is in a most unhappy way\r\nconnected, I may as well explain here and now why so fastidious a\r\ngentleman as Randolph Stone came to wear it. The gentleman called Howard\r\nVan Burnam was not the only person who visited the Van Burnam offices on\r\nthe morning preceding the murder. Randolph Stone was there also, but he\r\ndid not see the brothers, for finding them closeted together, he decided\r\nnot to interrupt them. As he was a frequent visitor there, his presence\r\ncreated no remark nor was his departure noted. Descending the stairs\r\nseparating the offices from the street, he was about to leave the\r\nbuilding, when he noticed that the clouds looked ominous. Being dressed\r\nfor a luncheon with Miss Althorpe, he felt averse to getting wet, so he\r\nstepped back into the adjoining hall and began groping for an umbrella\r\nin a little closet under the stairs where he had once before found such\r\nan article. While doing this he heard the younger Van Burnam descend and\r\ngo out, and realizing that he could now see Franklin without difficulty,\r\nhe was about to return up-stairs when he heard that gentleman also come\r\ndown and follow his brother into the street.\r\n\r\n"His first impulse was to join him, but finding nothing but an old\r\nduster in the closet, he gave up this intention, and putting on this\r\nshabby but protecting garment, started for his apartments, little\r\nrealizing into what a course of duplicity and crime it was destined to\r\nlead him. For to the wearing of this old duster on this especial\r\nmorning, innocent as the occasion was, I attribute John Randolph\'s\r\ntemptation to murder. Had he gone out without it, he would have taken\r\nhis usual course up Broadway and never met _me_; or even if he had taken\r\nthe same roundabout way to his apartments as that which led to our\r\nencounter, he would never have dared, in his ordinary fine dress,\r\nconspicuous as it made him, to have entered upon those measures, which,\r\nas he is clever enough to know, lead to disgrace, if they do not end in\r\na felon\'s cell. It was John Randolph, then, or Randolph Stone, as he is\r\npleased to call himself in New York, and not Franklin Van Burnam (who\r\nhad doubtless proceeded in another direction) who came up to where\r\nHoward had stood, saw the keys he had dropped, and put them in his own\r\npocket. It was as innocent an action as the donning of the duster, and\r\nyet it was fraught with the worst consequences to himself and others.\r\n\r\n"Being of the same height and complexion as Franklin Van Burnam, and\r\nboth gentlemen wearing at that time a moustache (my husband shaved his\r\noff after the murder), the mistakes which arose out of this strange\r\nequipment were but natural. Seen from the rear or in the semi-darkness\r\nof a hotel-office they might look alike, though to me or to any one\r\nstudying them well, their faces are really very different.\r\n\r\n"But to return. Leading me through streets of which I knew nothing, he\r\npresently stopped before the entrance of a large hotel.\r\n\r\n"\'I tell you what, Olive,\' said he, \'we had better go in here, take a\r\nroom, and send for such things as you require to make you look like a\r\nlady.\'\r\n\r\n"As I had no objection to anything which kept me at his side, I told him\r\nthat whatever suited him suited me, and followed him quite eagerly into\r\nthe office. I did not know then that this hotel was a second-rate one,\r\nnot having had experience with the best, but if I had, I should not have\r\nwondered at his choice, for there was nothing in his appearance, as I\r\nhave already intimated, or in his manners up to this point, to lead me\r\nto think he was one of the city\'s great swells, and that it was only in\r\nsuch an unfashionable house as this he would be likely to pass\r\nunrecognized. How with his markedly handsome features and distinguished\r\nbearing he managed so to carry himself as to look like a man of inferior\r\nbreeding, I can no more explain than I can the singular change which\r\ntook place in him when once he found himself in the midst of the crowd\r\nwhich lounged about this office.\r\n\r\n"From a man to attract all eyes he became at once a man to attract none,\r\nand slouched and looked so ordinary that I stared at him in\r\nastonishment, little thinking that he had assumed this manner as a\r\ndisguise. Seeing me at a loss, he spoke up quite peremptorily:\r\n\r\n"\'Let us keep our secret, Olive, till you can appear in the world\r\nfull-fledged. And look here, darling, won\'t you go to the desk and ask\r\nfor a room? I am no hand at any such business.\'\r\n\r\n"Confounded at a proposition so unexpected, but too much under the spell\r\nof my feelings to dispute his wishes, I faltered out:\r\n\r\n"\'But supposing they ask me to register?\'\r\n\r\n"At which he gave me a look which recalled the old days in Michigan, and\r\nquietly sneered:\r\n\r\n"\'Give them a fictitious name. You have learned to write by this time,\r\nhave you not?\'\r\n\r\n"Stung by his taunt, but more in love with him than ever, for his\r\nmomentary display of passion had made him look both masterful and\r\nhandsome, I went up to the desk to do his bidding.\r\n\r\n"\'A room!\' said I; and when asked to write our names in the book that\r\nlay before me, I put down the first that suggested itself. I wrote with\r\nmy gloves on, which was why the writing looked so queer that it was\r\ntaken for a disguised hand.\r\n\r\n"This done, he rejoined me, and we went up-stairs, and I was too happy\r\nto be in his company again to wonder at his peculiarities or weigh the\r\nconsequences of the implicit confidence I accorded him. I was\r\ndesperately in love once more, and entered into every plan he proposed\r\nwithout a thought beyond the joyous present. He was so handsome without\r\nhis hat; and when after some short delay he threw aside the duster, I\r\nfelt myself for the first time in my life in the presence of a finished\r\ngentleman. Then his manner was so changed. He was so like his oldest and\r\nbest self, so dangerously like what he was in those long vanished hours\r\nunder the pines in my sand-swept home on the shores of Lake Michigan.\r\nThat he faltered at times and sank into strange spells of silence which\r\nhad something in them that made my breath come fitfully, did not awaken\r\nmy apprehension or rouse in me more than a passing curiosity. I thought\r\nhe regretted the past, and when, after one such pause in our\r\nconversation, he drew out of his pocket a couple of keys tied together\r\nwith a string, and surveyed the card attached to them with a strange\r\nlook, easily enough to be understood by me now, I only laughed at his\r\nabstraction, and indulged in a fresh caress to make him more mindful of\r\nmy presence.\r\n\r\n"These keys were the ones which Mrs. Van Burnam\'s husband had dropped,\r\nand which he had picked up before meeting me; and after he had put them\r\nback into his pocket he became more talkative than before, and more\r\nsystematically lover-like. I think he had not seen his way clearly till\r\nthis moment, the dark and dreadful way which was to end, as he supposed,\r\nin my death.\r\n\r\n"But I feared nothing, suspected nothing. Such deep and desperate\r\nwickedness as he was planning was beyond the wildest flight of my\r\nimagination. When he insisted upon sending for a complete set of\r\nclothing for me, and when at his dictation I wrote a list of the\r\narticles I wanted, I thought he was influenced by his wish as my husband\r\nto see me dressed in articles of his own buying. That it was all a plot\r\nto rob me of my identity could not strike such a mind as mine, and when\r\nthe packages came and were received by him in the sly way already known\r\nto the public, I saw nothing in his caution but a playful display of\r\nmystery that was to end in my romantic establishment in a home of love\r\nand luxury.\r\n\r\n"Or rather it is thus that I account for my conduct now, and yet the\r\nprecaution I took not to change the shoes in which my money was hidden,\r\nmay argue that I was not without some underlying doubt of his complete\r\nsincerity. But if so, I hid it from myself, and, as I have every reason\r\nto believe, from him also, doubtless excusing my action to myself by\r\nconsidering that I would be none the worse off for a few dollars of my\r\nown, even if he was my husband, and had promised me no end of pleasure\r\nand comfort.\r\n\r\n"That he did intend to make me happy, he had assured me more than once.\r\nIndeed, before we had been long in this hotel room, he informed me that\r\ngreat experiences lay before me; that he had prospered much in the last\r\nfive years and had now a house of his own to offer me and a large circle\r\nof friends to make our life in it agreeable.\r\n\r\n"\'We will go to our house to-night,\' said he. \'I have not been living in\r\nit lately, and you may find it a little uncomfortable, but we will\r\nremedy that to-morrow. Anything is better than staying here under a\r\nfalse name and I cannot take you to my bachelor apartment.\'\r\n\r\n"I had doubted some of his previous statements, but this one I\r\nimplicitly believed. Why should not so elegant a man have a house of his\r\nown; and if he had told me it was built of marble and hung with\r\nFlorentine tapestries, I should still have credited it all. I was in\r\nfairy-land and he was my knight of romance, even when he again hung his\r\nhead in leaving the hotel and looked at once so ordinary and\r\nuninteresting.\r\n\r\n"The ruse he made use of to cut off all connection between ourselves and\r\nthe Mr. and Mrs. James Pope who had registered at the Hotel D---- was\r\naccepted by me with the same lack of suspicion. That he should wish to\r\ncarry no remembrance of our old life into our new home I thought a\r\ndelightful piece of folly, and when he proposed that we should bequeath\r\nmy gossamer and his own disfiguring duster to the coachman in whose hack\r\nwe were then riding, I laughed gleefully and helped him fold them up and\r\nplace them under the cushions, though I did wonder why he cut a piece\r\nout of the neck of the former, and pouted with the happy freedom of a\r\nself-confident woman when he said:\r\n\r\n"\'It is the first thing I ever bought for you, and I am just foolish\r\nenough to wish to preserve this much of it for a keepsake. Do you\r\nobject, my dear?\'\r\n\r\n"As I was conscious of cherishing a similar folly in his regard, and\r\ncould have pressed even that old duster of his to my heart, I offered\r\nhim a kiss and said \'No,\' and he put the scrap away in his pocket. That\r\nit was the portion on which was stamped the name of the firm from which\r\nit was bought did not occur to me.\r\n\r\n"When the coach stopped, he urged me away on foot in a direction\r\nentirely strange to me, saying we would take another hack as soon as we\r\nhad disposed of the bundles we were carrying. How he intended to do\r\nthis, I did not know. But presently he drew me towards a Chinese\r\nlaundry, where he bade me leave one of them as washing, and the other he\r\ndropped before the opening of a sewer as we stepped up a neighboring\r\ncurb-stone.\r\n\r\n"And still I did not suspect.\r\n\r\n"Our ride to Gramercy Park was short, but during it he had time to put a\r\nbill in my hand and tell me I was to pay the driver. He had also time to\r\nsecure the weapon upon which he had probably had his eye fixed from the\r\nfirst. His manner of doing this I can never forgive, for it was a\r\nlover\'s manner, and as such intended to deceive and cajole me. Drawing\r\nmy head down on his shoulder, he drew off my veil, saying that it was\r\nthe only article left of my own buying, and that we would leave it\r\nbehind us in this coach as we had left the gossamer in the other. \'Only\r\nI will make sure that no other woman ever wears it,\' he laughed,\r\nslitting it up and down with his knife. When this was done he kissed me,\r\nand then while my heart was tender and the warm tears stood in my eyes,\r\nhe drew out the pin from my hat, meeting my remonstrances with the\r\nassurance that he hated to see my head covered, and that no hat was as\r\npretty as my own brown hair.\r\n\r\n"As this was nonsense, and as the coach was beginning to stop, I shook\r\nmy head at him and put my hat on again, but he had dropped the pin, or\r\nso he said, and I had to alight without it.\r\n\r\n"When I had paid the driver and the coach had driven off, I had a chance\r\nto look up at the house before which we had stopped. Its height and\r\nimposing appearance daunted me in spite of the great expectations I had\r\nformed, and I ran up the stoop after him in a condition of mingled awe\r\nand wild delight that was the poorest preparation possible for what lay\r\nbefore me in the dark interior we were entering.\r\n\r\n"He was fumbling nervously in the keyhole with his key, and I heard a\r\nwhispered oath escape him. But presently the door fell back, and we\r\nstepped in to what looked to me like a cavern of darkness.\r\n\r\n"\'Do not be frightened!\' he admonished me. \'I will strike a light in a\r\nmoment.\' And after carefully closing the street door behind us, he\r\nstretched out his hand to take mine, or so I judge, for I heard him\r\nwhisper impatiently, \'Where are you?\'\r\n\r\n"I was on the threshold of the parlor, to which I had groped my way\r\nwhile he was closing the front door, so I whispered back, \'Here!\' but\r\nfound voice for nothing further, for at that instant I heard a sound\r\nproceeding from the depths of darkness in front of me, and was so struck\r\nwith terror that I fell back against the staircase, just as he passed me\r\nand entered the room from which that stealthy noise had issued.\r\n\r\n"\'Darling!\' he whispered, \'darling!\' and went stumbling on in the void\r\nof darkness before me, till suddenly by some power I cannot explain I\r\nseemed to see, faintly but distinctly, and as if with my mind\'s eye\r\nrather than with my bodily one.\r\n\r\n"I perceived the shadowy form of a woman standing in the space before\r\nhim, and beheld him suddenly grasp her with what he meant to be a loving\r\ncry, but which to my ears at that moment sounded strangely ferocious,\r\nand after holding her a moment suddenly release her, at which she\r\nuttered one low, curdling moan and sank at his feet. At the same instant\r\nI heard a click, which I did not understand then, but which I now know\r\nto have been the head of the hat-pin striking the register.\r\n\r\n"Horrified past all power of speech and action, for I saw that he had\r\nintended this blow for me, I cowered against the stairs, waiting for him\r\nto pass out. This he did not do at once, though the delay must have been\r\nshort. He stopped long enough by the prostrate form to stir it with his\r\nfoot, probably to see if life was extinct, but no longer, yet it seemed\r\nan eternity before I perceived him groping his way over the threshold;\r\nan eternity in which every act of my life passed before me, and every\r\nword and every expression with which he had beguiled me came to rack my\r\nsoul and made the horror of this mad awakening greater.\r\n\r\n"No thought of her, or of the guilt with which he had forever damned his\r\nsoul, came to me in that first moment of misery. _My_ loss, _my_ escape,\r\nand the danger in which I still stood if the least hint reached him of\r\nthe mistake he had made, filled my mind too entirely for me to dwell on\r\nany less impersonal theme. His words, for he muttered several in that\r\nshort passage out, showed me in what a fools\' paradise I had been\r\nrevelling, and how certainly I had turned his every thought towards\r\nmurder when I seized him in the street and proclaimed myself his wife.\r\nThe satisfaction with which he uttered, \'Well struck!\' gave little hint\r\nof remorse; and the gloating delight with which he added something about\r\nthe devil having assisted him to make it a safe blow as well as a deadly\r\none, was proof not only of his having used all his cunning in planning\r\nthis crime, but of his pleasure in its apparent success.\r\n\r\n"That he continued in this frame of mind, and that he never lost\r\nconfidence in the precautions he had taken and in the mystery with which\r\nthe deed was surrounded, is apparent from the fact that he revisited the\r\nVan Burnam office on the following morning, and hung again on its\r\naccustomed nail the keys of the Gramercy Park house.\r\n\r\n"When the front door had closed, and I knew that he had gone away in the\r\nfull belief that it was my form he had left lying behind him on that\r\nmidnight floor, all the accumulated terrors of the situation came to me\r\nin full force, and I began to think of her as well as of myself, and\r\nlonged for courage to approach her or even the daring to call out for\r\nhelp. But the thought that it was my husband who had committed this\r\ncrime held me tongue-tied, and though I soon began to move inch by inch\r\nin her direction, it was some time before I could so far overcome my\r\nterror as to enter the room where she lay.\r\n\r\n"I had supposed, and still supposed (as was natural after seeing him\r\nopen the door with the keys he took from his pocket), that the house was\r\nhis, and the victim a member of his own household. But when, after\r\ninnumerable hesitations and a bodily shrinking that was little short of\r\ntorment, I managed to drag myself into the room and light a match which\r\nI found on a farther mantel-shelf, I saw enough in the general\r\nappearance of the rooms and of the figure at my feet to make me doubt\r\nthe truth of both these suppositions. Yet no other explanation came to\r\nlighten the mystery of the occasion, and dazed as I was by the horror of\r\nmy position and the mortal dread I felt of the man who in one instant\r\nhad turned the heaven of my love into a hell of fathomless horrors, I\r\nsoon had eyes for the one fact only, that the woman lying before me was\r\nsufficiently like myself to inspire me with the hope of preserving my\r\nsecret and keeping from my would-be slayer the knowledge of my having\r\nescaped the doom he had prepared for me.\r\n\r\n"For ascribe it to what motive you will, that was the one idea now\r\ndominating my mind. I wanted him to believe me dead. I wanted to feel\r\nthat all connection between us was severed forever. He _had_ killed me.\r\nBy killing my love and faith in him he had murdered the better part of\r\nmyself, and I shrank with inconceivable horror from anything that would\r\nbring me again under his eye, or force me to assert claims that it would\r\nbe the future business of my life to forget.\r\n\r\n"When the first match went out I had not courage to light another, so I\r\ncrept away in the darkness to listen at the foot of the stairs. There\r\nwas no sound from above, and a terrifying sense began to pervade me that\r\nI was in that house alone. Yet there was safety in the thought, and\r\nopportunity for what I was planning, and finally, under the stress of\r\nthe purpose that was every moment developing within me, I went softly\r\nup-stairs and listened at all the doors till I was certain that the\r\nhouse was unoccupied. Then I came down and walked resolutely back into\r\nthe parlor, for I knew if I allowed any time to pass I could never again\r\nsummon up strength to cross its grisly threshold. Yet I did nothing for\r\nhours but crouch in one of its dismal corners, waiting for morning. That\r\nI did not go mad in that awful interval is a wonder. I must have been\r\nnear it more than once.\r\n\r\n"I have been asked, and Miss Butterworth has been asked, how in the\r\nlight of what we now know concerning this poor victim\'s presence there,\r\nwe account for her being in the darkness and showing so little terror at\r\nour entrance and Mr. Stone\'s approach. _I_ account for it in this way:\r\nTwo half-burned matches were found in the parlor grate. One I flung\r\nthere; the other had probably been used by her to light the dining-room\r\ngas. If this was still lighted when we drove up, as it may have been,\r\nthen, alarmed by the sound of the stopping coach, she had put it out,\r\nwith a vague idea of hiding herself till she knew whether it was the old\r\ngentleman who was coming or only her suspicious and unreasonable\r\nhusband. If it was not lighted then, she was probably aroused from a\r\nsleep on the parlor sofa, and was for the moment too dazed to cry out or\r\nresent an embrace she had not time to understand before she succumbed to\r\nthe cruel stab that killed her. Miss Butterworth, however, thinks that\r\nthe poor creature took the intruder for Franklin till she heard my\r\nvoice, when she probably became so amazed that she was in a measure\r\nparalyzed and found it impossible to move or cry out. As Miss\r\nButterworth is a woman of great discretion I should think her\r\nexplanation the truest, if I did not consider her a little prejudiced\r\nagainst Mrs. Van Burnam.\r\n\r\n"But to return to myself.\r\n\r\n"With the first glimmer of light that came through the closed shutters I\r\nrose and began my dreadful task. Upheld by a purpose as relentless as\r\nthat which drove the author of this horror into murder, I stripped the\r\nbody and put upon it my own clothing, with the one exception of the\r\nshoes. Then, when I had re-dressed myself in hers, I steadied up my\r\nheart and with one wild pull dragged down the cabinet upon her so that\r\nher face might lose its traits and her identification become impossible.\r\n\r\n"How I had strength to do this, and how I could contemplate the result\r\nwithout shrieking, I cannot now imagine. Perhaps I was hardly human at\r\nthis crisis; perhaps something of the demon which had informed him in\r\nhis awful work had entered into my breast, making this thing possible. I\r\nonly know that I did what I have said and did it calmly. More than that,\r\nthat I had mind and judgment left to give to my own appearance.\r\nObserving that the dress I had put on was of a conspicuous plaid, I\r\nexchanged the skirt portion with the brown silk petticoat under it, and\r\nwhen I observed that it hung below the other, as of course it would, I\r\nwent through the house till I came upon some pins with which I pinned it\r\nup out of sight. Thus equipped, I was still a person to attract\r\nattention, especially as I had no hat to put on; my own having fallen\r\nfrom my head and been covered by the dead woman\'s body, which nothing\r\nwould induce me to move again.\r\n\r\n"But I had confidence in my own powers to escape question, toned up as\r\nI was in every nerve by the dreadfulness of my situation, and as soon as\r\nI was in decent shape for flight, I opened the front door and prepared\r\nto slip out.\r\n\r\n"But here the intense dread I felt of my husband, a dread which had\r\nactuated all my movements and sustained me in as harrowing a task as\r\never woman performed, seized me with renewed force, and I quailed at the\r\nprospect of entering the streets alone. Supposing he should be on the\r\nstoop! Supposing he should be in an opposite window even! Could I\r\nencounter him again and live? He was not far away, or so I felt. A\r\nmurderer, it is said, cannot help haunting the scene of his crime, and\r\nif he should see me alive and well, what might I not expect from his\r\nastonishment and alarm? I did not dare go out. But neither did I dare\r\nremain, so after quaking for a good five minutes on the threshold, I\r\nmade one wild dash through the door.\r\n\r\n"There was no one in sight, and I reached Broadway before I ran across\r\nman or woman. Even then I got by without any one speaking to me, and,\r\nfavored by Providence, found a nook at the end of an alley-way, where I\r\nremained undiscovered till it was late enough in the morning for me to\r\nenter a shop and buy a hat.\r\n\r\n"The rest of my movements are known. I found my way to Mrs. Desberger\'s,\r\nthis time without interruption; and from that place sought and found a\r\nsituation with Miss Althorpe.\r\n\r\n"That her fate was in any way connected with mine, or that the Randolph\r\nStone she was engaged to marry was the John Randolph from whose clutches\r\nI had just escaped, was, of course, unsuspected by me, and, incredible\r\nas it may seem, continued to be unsuspected as long as I remained in the\r\nhouse. There was reason for this. My duties were such as I could well\r\nattend to in my own room, and feeling a horror of the world and\r\neverything in it, I kept my room as much as possible, and never went out\r\nof it when I knew that he was in the house. The very thought of love\r\nawakened intolerable emotions in me, and much as I admired and revered\r\nMiss Althorpe, I could not bring myself to meet or even talk of the man\r\nto whom she was in expectation of being so soon united. There was\r\nanother thing of which I was ignorant, and that was the circumstances\r\nwhich had invested with so much interest the crime of which I had been\r\nwitness. I did not know that the victim had been recognized, or that an\r\ninnocent man had been arrested for her murder. In fact I knew nothing\r\nconcerning the affair save what I had seen with my own eyes, no one\r\nhaving mentioned the murder in my presence, and I having religiously\r\navoided the very sight of a paper for fear that I should see some\r\naccount of the horrible affair, and so lose what small remnants of\r\ncourage I still possessed.\r\n\r\n"This apathy concerning a matter so important to myself, or rather this\r\nalmost frenzied determination to cut myself loose from my dreadful past,\r\nmay seem strange and unnatural; but it will seem stranger yet when I say\r\nthat for all these efforts I was haunted night and day by one small fact\r\nconnected with this past, which made forgetfulness impossible. I had\r\ntaken the rings from the hands of the dead woman as I had taken away her\r\nclothes, and the possession of these valuables, probably because they\r\nrepresented so much money, weighed on my conscience and made me feel\r\nlike a thief. The purse which I found in a pocket of the skirt I had put\r\non was a trouble to me, but the rings were a source of constant terror\r\nand disturbance. I hid them finally in a ball of yarn I was using, but\r\neven then I experienced but little peace, for they were not mine, and I\r\nlacked the courage to avow it or seek out the person to whom they now\r\nrightfully belonged.\r\n\r\n"When, therefore, in the intervals of fever which attacked me in Miss\r\nAlthorpe\'s house, I overheard enough of a conversation between her and\r\nMiss Butterworth to learn that the murdered woman had been a Mrs. Van\r\nBurnam, and that her husband or relatives had an office somewhere\r\ndowntown, I was so seized by the instinct of restitution, that I took\r\nthe first opportunity that offered to leave my bed and hunt up these\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n"That I would injure them in any way by secretly restoring these jewels,\r\nI never dreamed. Indeed, I did not exercise my mind at all on the\r\nsubject, but only followed the instincts of my delirium; and while to\r\nall appearance I showed all the cunning of an insane person, in the\r\npursuit of my purpose, I fail to remember now how I found my way to\r\nDuane Street, or by what suggestion of my diseased brain I was induced\r\nto slip these rings upon the hook attached to Mr. Van Burnam\'s desk.\r\nProbably the mere utterance of this well-known name into the ears of the\r\npassers-by was enough to obtain for me such directions as I needed, but\r\nhowever that may be, the result was misapprehension, and the\r\ncomplications which followed, serious.\r\n\r\n"Of the emotion caused in me by the unaccountable discovery of my\r\nconnection with this crime I need not speak. The love which I at one\r\ntime felt for John Randolph had turned to gall and bitterness, but\r\nenough sense of duty remained in my bruised and broken heart to keep me\r\nfrom denouncing him to the police, till by a sudden stroke of fate or\r\nProvidence, I saw him in the carriage with Miss Althorpe, and realized\r\nthat he was not only the man with whom she was upon the point of allying\r\nherself, but that it was to preserve his place in her regard and to\r\nattain the lofty position promised by this union, he had attempted to\r\nmurder me, and had murdered another woman only less unfortunate and\r\nmiserable than myself.\r\n\r\n"It was the last and bitterest blow that could come from his hand; and\r\nthough instinct led me to throw myself into the carriage before which I\r\nstood, and thus escape a meeting which I felt I could never survive, I\r\nwas determined from that moment not only to save Miss Althorpe from an\r\nalliance with this villain, but to revenge myself upon him in some\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten manner.\r\n\r\n"That this revenge involved her in a public shame from which her angelic\r\ngoodness to me should have saved her, I regret now as deeply as even she\r\ncan wish. But the madness that was upon me made me blind to every other\r\nconsideration than that of the boundless hatred I bore him; and while I\r\ncan look for no forgiveness from her on that account, I still hope the\r\nday will come when she will see that in spite of my momentary disregard\r\nof her feelings, I cherish for her an affection that nothing can efface\r\nor make other than the ruling passion of my life."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLII.\r\n\r\nWITH MISS BUTTERWORTH\'S COMPLIMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey tell me that Mr. Gryce has never been quite the same man since the\r\nclearing up of this mystery; that his confidence in his own powers is\r\nshaken, and that he hints, more often than is agreeable to his\r\nsuperiors, that when a man has passed his seventy-seventh year it is\r\ntime for him to give up active connection with police matters. _I_ do\r\nnot agree with him. His mistakes, if we may call them such, were not\r\nthose of failing faculties, but of a man made oversecure in his own\r\nconclusions by a series of old successes. Had he listened to _me_--But I\r\nwill not pursue this suggestion. You will accuse me of egotism, an\r\nimputation I cannot bear with equanimity and will not risk; modest\r\ndepreciation of myself being one of the chief attributes of my\r\ncharacter.[D]\r\n\r\nHoward Van Burnam bore his release, as he had his arrest, with great\r\noutward composure. Mr. Gryce\'s explanation of his motives in perjuring\r\nhimself before the Coroner was correct, and while the mass of people\r\nwondered at that instinct of pride which led him to risk the imputation\r\nof murder sooner than have the world accuse his wife of an unwomanly\r\naction, there were others who understood his peculiarities, and thought\r\nhis conduct quite in keeping with what they knew of his warped and\r\nover-sensitive nature.\r\n\r\nThat he has been greatly moved by the unmerited fate of his weak but\r\nunfortunate wife, is evident from the sincerity with which he still\r\nmourns her.\r\n\r\nI had always understood that Franklin had never been told of the peril\r\nin which his good name had stood for a few short hours. But since a\r\ncertain confidential conversation which took place between us one\r\nevening, I have come to the conclusion that the police were not so\r\nreticent as they made themselves out to be. In that conversation he\r\nprofessed to thank me for certain good offices I had done him and his,\r\nand waxing warm in his gratitude, confessed that without my interference\r\nhe would have found himself in a strait of no ordinary seriousness;\r\n"For," said he, "there has been no over-statement of the feelings I\r\ncherished toward my sister-in-law, nor was there any mistake made in\r\nthinking that she uttered some very desperate threats against me during\r\nthe visit she paid me at my office on Monday. But I never thought of\r\nridding myself of her in any way. I only thought of keeping her and my\r\nbrother apart till I could escape the country. When therefore he came\r\ninto the office on Tuesday morning for the keys of our father\'s house, I\r\nfelt such a dread of the two meeting there, that I left immediately\r\nafter my brother for the place where she had told me she would await a\r\nfinal message from me. I hoped to move her by one final plea, for I love\r\nmy brother sincerely, notwithstanding the wrong I once did him. I was\r\ntherefore with her in another place at the very time I was thought to be\r\nwith her at the Hotel D----, a fact which greatly hampered me, as you\r\ncan see, when I was requested by the police to give an account of how I\r\nspent that day. When I left her it was to seek my brother. She had told\r\nme of her deliberate intention of spending the night in the Gramercy\r\nPark house; and as I saw no way of her doing this without my brother\'s\r\nconnivance, I started in search of him, meaning to stick to him when I\r\nfound him, and keep him away from her till that night was over. I was\r\nnot successful in my undertaking. He was locked in his rooms it seems,\r\npacking up his effects for flight,--we always had the same instincts\r\neven when boys,--and receiving no answer to my knock, I hastened away to\r\nGramercy Park to keep a watch over the house against my brother coming\r\nthere. This was early in the evening, and for hours afterwards I\r\nwandered like a restless spirit in and out of those streets, meeting no\r\none I knew, not even my brother, though he was wandering about in very\r\nmuch the same manner, and with very much the same apprehensions.\r\n\r\n"The duplicity of the woman became very evident to me the next morning.\r\nIn my last interview with her she had shown no relenting in her purpose\r\ntowards me, but when I entered my office after this restless night in\r\nthe streets, I found lying on my desk her little hand-bag, which had\r\nbeen sent down from Mrs. Parker\'s. In it was _the letter_, just as you\r\ndivined, Miss Butterworth. I had hardly got over the shock of this most\r\nunexpected good fortune when the news came that a woman had been found\r\ndead in my father\'s house. What was I to think? That it was she, of\r\ncourse, and that my brother had been the man to let her in there. Miss\r\nButterworth," this is how he ended, "I make no demands upon you, as I\r\nhave made no demands upon the police, to keep the secret contained in\r\nthat letter from my much-abused brother. Or, rather, it is too late now\r\nto keep it, for I have told him all there was to tell, myself, and he\r\nhas seen fit to overlook my fault, and to regard me with even more\r\naffection than he did before this dreadful tragedy came to harrow up our\r\nlives."\r\n\r\nDo you wonder I like Franklin Van Burnam?\r\n\r\nThe Misses Van Burnam call upon me regularly, and when they say "_Dear\r\nold thing!_" now, they mean it.\r\n\r\nOf Miss Althorpe I cannot trust myself to speak. She was, and is, the\r\nfinest woman I know, and when the great shadow now hanging over her has\r\nlost some of its impenetrability, she will be a useful one again, or I\r\ndo not rightly read the patient smile which makes her face so beautiful\r\nin its sadness.\r\n\r\nOlive Randolph has, at my request, taken up her abode in my house. The\r\ncharm which she seems to have exerted over others she has exerted over\r\nme, and I doubt if I shall ever wish to part with her again. In return\r\nshe gives me an affection which I am now getting old enough to\r\nappreciate. Her feeling for me and her gratitude to Miss Althorpe are\r\nthe only treasures left her out of the wreck of her life, and it shall\r\nbe my business to make them lasting ones.\r\n\r\nThe fate of Randolph Stone is too well known for me to enlarge upon it.\r\nBut before I bid farewell to his name, I must say that after that curt\r\nconfession of his, "Yes, I did it, in the way and for the motive she\r\nalleged," I have often tried to imagine the contradictory feelings with\r\nwhich he must have listened to the facts as they came out at the\r\ninquest, and convinced, as he had every reason to be, that the victim\r\nwas his wife, heard his friend Howard not only accept her for his, but\r\ninsist that he was the man who accompanied her to that house of death.\r\nHe has never lifted the veil from those hours, and he never will, but I\r\nwould give much of the peace of mind which has lately come to me, to\r\nknow what his sensations were, not only at that time, but when, on the\r\nevening, after the murder, he opened the papers and read that the woman\r\nwhom he had left for dead with her brain pierced by a hat-pin, had been\r\nfound on that same floor crushed under a fallen cabinet; and what\r\nexplanation he was ever able to make to himself for a fact so\r\ninexplicable.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote D: My attention has been called to the fact that I have not\r\nconfessed whether it was owing to a mistake made by Mr. Gryce or myself,\r\nthat Franklin Van Burnam was identified as the man who had entered the\r\nadjoining house on the night of the murder. Well, the truth is, neither\r\nof us was to blame for that. The man I identified (it was while watching\r\nthe guests who attended Mrs. Van Burnam\'s funeral, you remember) was\r\nreally Mr. Stone; but owing to the fact that this latter gentleman had\r\nlingered in the vestibule till he was joined by Franklin and that they\r\nhad finally entered together, some confusion was created in the mind of\r\nthe man on duty in the hall, so that when Mr. Gryce asked him who it was\r\nthat came in immediately after the four who arrived together, he\r\nanswered Mr. Franklin Van Burnam; being anxious to win his superior\'s\r\napplause and considering that person much more likely to merit the\r\ndetective\'s attention than a mere friend of the family like Mr. Stone.\r\nIn punishment for this momentary display of egotism, he has been\r\ndischarged from the force, I believe.--A.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
