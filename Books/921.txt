Suffering is one very long moment.  We cannot divide it by seasons.\r\nWe can only record its moods, and chronicle their return.  With us time\r\nitself does not progress.  It revolves.  It seems to circle round one\r\ncentre of pain.  The paralysing immobility of a life every circumstance\r\nof which is regulated after an unchangeable pattern, so that we eat and\r\ndrink and lie down and pray, or kneel at least for prayer, according to\r\nthe inflexible laws of an iron formula: this immobile quality, that makes\r\neach dreadful day in the very minutest detail like its brother, seems to\r\ncommunicate itself to those external forces the very essence of whose\r\nexistence is ceaseless change.  Of seed-time or harvest, of the reapers\r\nbending over the corn, or the grape gatherers threading through the\r\nvines, of the grass in the orchard made white with broken blossoms or\r\nstrewn with fallen fruit: of these we know nothing and can know nothing.\r\n\r\nFor us there is only one season, the season of sorrow.  The very sun and\r\nmoon seem taken from us.  Outside, the day may be blue and gold, but the\r\nlight that creeps down through the thickly-muffled glass of the small\r\niron-barred window beneath which one sits is grey and niggard.  It is\r\nalways twilight in one\'s cell, as it is always twilight in one\'s heart.\r\nAnd in the sphere of thought, no less than in the sphere of time, motion\r\nis no more.  The thing that you personally have long ago forgotten, or\r\ncan easily forget, is happening to me now, and will happen to me again to-\r\nmorrow.  Remember this, and you will be able to understand a little of\r\nwhy I am writing, and in this manner writing. . . .\r\n\r\nA week later, I am transferred here.  Three more months go over and my\r\nmother dies.  No one knew how deeply I loved and honoured her.  Her death\r\nwas terrible to me; but I, once a lord of language, have no words in\r\nwhich to express my anguish and my shame.  She and my father had\r\nbequeathed me a name they had made noble and honoured, not merely in\r\nliterature, art, archaeology, and science, but in the public history of\r\nmy own country, in its evolution as a nation.  I had disgraced that name\r\neternally.  I had made it a low by-word among low people.  I had dragged\r\nit through the very mire.  I had given it to brutes that they might make\r\nit brutal, and to fools that they might turn it into a synonym for folly.\r\nWhat I suffered then, and still suffer, is not for pen to write or paper\r\nto record.  My wife, always kind and gentle to me, rather than that I\r\nshould hear the news from indifferent lips, travelled, ill as she was,\r\nall the way from Genoa to England to break to me herself the tidings of\r\nso irreparable, so irremediable, a loss.  Messages of sympathy reached me\r\nfrom all who had still affection for me.  Even people who had not known\r\nme personally, hearing that a new sorrow had broken into my life, wrote\r\nto ask that some expression of their condolence should be conveyed to me.\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nThree months go over.  The calendar of my daily conduct and labour that\r\nhangs on the outside of my cell door, with my name and sentence written\r\nupon it, tells me that it is May. . . .\r\n\r\nProsperity, pleasure and success, may be rough of grain and common in\r\nfibre, but sorrow is the most sensitive of all created things.  There is\r\nnothing that stirs in the whole world of thought to which sorrow does not\r\nvibrate in terrible and exquisite pulsation.  The thin beaten-out leaf of\r\ntremulous gold that chronicles the direction of forces the eye cannot see\r\nis in comparison coarse.  It is a wound that bleeds when any hand but\r\nthat of love touches it, and even then must bleed again, though not in\r\npain.\r\n\r\nWhere there is sorrow there is holy ground.  Some day people will realise\r\nwhat that means.  They will know nothing of life till they do,--and\r\nnatures like his can realise it.  When I was brought down from my prison\r\nto the Court of Bankruptcy, between two policemen,--waited in the long\r\ndreary corridor that, before the whole crowd, whom an action so sweet and\r\nsimple hushed into silence, he might gravely raise his hat to me, as,\r\nhandcuffed and with bowed head, I passed him by.  Men have gone to heaven\r\nfor smaller things than that.  It was in this spirit, and with this mode\r\nof love, that the saints knelt down to wash the feet of the poor, or\r\nstooped to kiss the leper on the cheek.  I have never said one single\r\nword to him about what he did.  I do not know to the present moment\r\nwhether he is aware that I was even conscious of his action.  It is not a\r\nthing for which one can render formal thanks in formal words.  I store it\r\nin the treasure-house of my heart.  I keep it there as a secret debt that\r\nI am glad to think I can never possibly repay.  It is embalmed and kept\r\nsweet by the myrrh and cassia of many tears.  When wisdom has been\r\nprofitless to me, philosophy barren, and the proverbs and phrases of\r\nthose who have sought to give me consolation as dust and ashes in my\r\nmouth, the memory of that little, lovely, silent act of love has unsealed\r\nfor me all the wells of pity: made the desert blossom like a rose, and\r\nbrought me out of the bitterness of lonely exile into harmony with the\r\nwounded, broken, and great heart of the world.  When people are able to\r\nunderstand, not merely how beautiful ---\'s action was, but why it meant\r\nso much to me, and always will mean so much, then, perhaps, they will\r\nrealise how and in what spirit they should approach me. . . .\r\n\r\nThe poor are wise, more charitable, more kind, more sensitive than we\r\nare.  In their eyes prison is a tragedy in a man\'s life, a misfortune, a\r\ncasuality, something that calls for sympathy in others.  They speak of\r\none who is in prison as of one who is \'in trouble\' simply.  It is the\r\nphrase they always use, and the expression has the perfect wisdom of love\r\nin it.  With people of our own rank it is different.  With us, prison\r\nmakes a man a pariah.  I, and such as I am, have hardly any right to air\r\nand sun.  Our presence taints the pleasures of others.  We are unwelcome\r\nwhen we reappear.  To revisit the glimpses of the moon is not for us.  Our\r\nvery children are taken away.  Those lovely links with humanity are\r\nbroken.  We are doomed to be solitary, while our sons still live.  We are\r\ndenied the one thing that might heal us and keep us, that might bring\r\nbalm to the bruised heart, and peace to the soul in pain. . . .\r\n\r\nI must say to myself that I ruined myself, and that nobody great or small\r\ncan be ruined except by his own hand.  I am quite ready to say so.  I am\r\ntrying to say so, though they may not think it at the present moment.\r\nThis pitiless indictment I bring without pity against myself.  Terrible\r\nas was what the world did to me, what I did to myself was far more\r\nterrible still.\r\n\r\nI was a man who stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my\r\nage.  I had realised this for myself at the very dawn of my manhood, and\r\nhad forced my age to realise it afterwards.  Few men hold such a position\r\nin their own lifetime, and have it so acknowledged.  It is usually\r\ndiscerned, if discerned at all, by the historian, or the critic, long\r\nafter both the man and his age have passed away.  With me it was\r\ndifferent.  I felt it myself, and made others feel it.  Byron was a\r\nsymbolic figure, but his relations were to the passion of his age and its\r\nweariness of passion.  Mine were to something more noble, more permanent,\r\nof more vital issue, of larger scope.\r\n\r\nThe gods had given me almost everything.  But I let myself be lured into\r\nlong spells of senseless and sensual ease.  I amused myself with being a\r\n_flaneur_, a dandy, a man of fashion.  I surrounded myself with the\r\nsmaller natures and the meaner minds.  I became the spendthrift of my own\r\ngenius, and to waste an eternal youth gave me a curious joy.  Tired of\r\nbeing on the heights, I deliberately went to the depths in the search for\r\nnew sensation.  What the paradox was to me in the sphere of thought,\r\nperversity became to me in the sphere of passion.  Desire, at the end,\r\nwas a malady, or a madness, or both.  I grew careless of the lives of\r\nothers.  I took pleasure where it pleased me, and passed on.  I forgot\r\nthat every little action of the common day makes or unmakes character,\r\nand that therefore what one has done in the secret chamber one has some\r\nday to cry aloud on the housetop.  I ceased to be lord over myself.  I\r\nwas no longer the captain of my soul, and did not know it.  I allowed\r\npleasure to dominate me.  I ended in horrible disgrace.  There is only\r\none thing for me now, absolute humility.\r\n\r\nI have lain in prison for nearly two years.  Out of my nature has come\r\nwild despair; an abandonment to grief that was piteous even to look at;\r\nterrible and impotent rage; bitterness and scorn; anguish that wept\r\naloud; misery that could find no voice; sorrow that was dumb.  I have\r\npassed through every possible mood of suffering.  Better than Wordsworth\r\nhimself I know what Wordsworth meant when he said--\r\n\r\n   \'Suffering is permanent, obscure, and dark\r\n   And has the nature of infinity.\'\r\n\r\nBut while there were times when I rejoiced in the idea that my sufferings\r\nwere to be endless, I could not bear them to be without meaning.  Now I\r\nfind hidden somewhere away in my nature something that tells me that\r\nnothing in the whole world is meaningless, and suffering least of all.\r\nThat something hidden away in my nature, like a treasure in a field, is\r\nHumility.\r\n\r\nIt is the last thing left in me, and the best: the ultimate discovery at\r\nwhich I have arrived, the starting-point for a fresh development.  It has\r\ncome to me right out of myself, so I know that it has come at the proper\r\ntime.  It could not have come before, nor later.  Had any one told me of\r\nit, I would have rejected it.  Had it been brought to me, I would have\r\nrefused it.  As I found it, I want to keep it.  I must do so.  It is the\r\none thing that has in it the elements of life, of a new life, _Vita\r\nNuova_ for me.  Of all things it is the strangest.  One cannot acquire\r\nit, except by surrendering everything that one has.  It is only when one\r\nhas lost all things, that one knows that one possesses it.\r\n\r\nNow I have realised that it is in me, I see quite clearly what I ought to\r\ndo; in fact, must do.  And when I use such a phrase as that, I need not\r\nsay that I am not alluding to any external sanction or command.  I admit\r\nnone.  I am far more of an individualist than I ever was.  Nothing seems\r\nto me of the smallest value except what one gets out of oneself.  My\r\nnature is seeking a fresh mode of self-realisation.  That is all I am\r\nconcerned with.  And the first thing that I have got to do is to free\r\nmyself from any possible bitterness of feeling against the world.\r\n\r\nI am completely penniless, and absolutely homeless.  Yet there are worse\r\nthings in the world than that.  I am quite candid when I say that rather\r\nthan go out from this prison with bitterness in my heart against the\r\nworld, I would gladly and readily beg my bread from door to door.  If I\r\ngot nothing from the house of the rich I would get something at the house\r\nof the poor.  Those who have much are often greedy; those who have little\r\nalways share.  I would not a bit mind sleeping in the cool grass in\r\nsummer, and when winter came on sheltering myself by the warm\r\nclose-thatched rick, or under the penthouse of a great barn, provided I\r\nhad love in my heart.  The external things of life seem to me now of no\r\nimportance at all.  You can see to what intensity of individualism I have\r\narrived--or am arriving rather, for the journey is long, and \'where I\r\nwalk there are thorns.\'\r\n\r\nOf course I know that to ask alms on the highway is not to be my lot, and\r\nthat if ever I lie in the cool grass at night-time it will be to write\r\nsonnets to the moon.  When I go out of prison, R--- will be waiting for\r\nme on the other side of the big iron-studded gate, and he is the symbol,\r\nnot merely of his own affection, but of the affection of many others\r\nbesides.  I believe I am to have enough to live on for about eighteen\r\nmonths at any rate, so that if I may not write beautiful books, I may at\r\nleast read beautiful books; and what joy can be greater?  After that, I\r\nhope to be able to recreate my creative faculty.\r\n\r\nBut were things different: had I not a friend left in the world; were\r\nthere not a single house open to me in pity; had I to accept the wallet\r\nand ragged cloak of sheer penury: as long as I am free from all\r\nresentment, hardness and scorn, I would be able to face the life with\r\nmuch more calm and confidence than I would were my body in purple and\r\nfine linen, and the soul within me sick with hate.\r\n\r\nAnd I really shall have no difficulty.  When you really want love you\r\nwill find it waiting for you.\r\n\r\nI need not say that my task does not end there.  It would be\r\ncomparatively easy if it did.  There is much more before me.  I have\r\nhills far steeper to climb, valleys much darker to pass through.  And I\r\nhave to get it all out of myself.  Neither religion, morality, nor reason\r\ncan help me at all.\r\n\r\nMorality does not help me.  I am a born antinomian.  I am one of those\r\nwho are made for exceptions, not for laws.  But while I see that there is\r\nnothing wrong in what one does, I see that there is something wrong in\r\nwhat one becomes.  It is well to have learned that.\r\n\r\nReligion does not help me.  The faith that others give to what is unseen,\r\nI give to what one can touch, and look at.  My gods dwell in temples made\r\nwith hands; and within the circle of actual experience is my creed made\r\nperfect and complete: too complete, it may be, for like many or all of\r\nthose who have placed their heaven in this earth, I have found in it not\r\nmerely the beauty of heaven, but the horror of hell also.  When I think\r\nabout religion at all, I feel as if I would like to found an order for\r\nthose who _cannot_ believe: the Confraternity of the Faithless, one might\r\ncall it, where on an altar, on which no taper burned, a priest, in whose\r\nheart peace had no dwelling, might celebrate with unblessed bread and a\r\nchalice empty of wine.  Every thing to be true must become a religion.\r\nAnd agnosticism should have its ritual no less than faith.  It has sown\r\nits martyrs, it should reap its saints, and praise God daily for having\r\nhidden Himself from man.  But whether it be faith or agnosticism, it must\r\nbe nothing external to me.  Its symbols must be of my own creating.  Only\r\nthat is spiritual which makes its own form.  If I may not find its secret\r\nwithin myself, I shall never find it: if I have not got it already, it\r\nwill never come to me.\r\n\r\nReason does not help me.  It tells me that the laws under which I am\r\nconvicted are wrong and unjust laws, and the system under which I have\r\nsuffered a wrong and unjust system.  But, somehow, I have got to make\r\nboth of these things just and right to me.  And exactly as in Art one is\r\nonly concerned with what a particular thing is at a particular moment to\r\noneself, so it is also in the ethical evolution of one\'s character.  I\r\nhave got to make everything that has happened to me good for me.  The\r\nplank bed, the loathsome food, the hard ropes shredded into oakum till\r\none\'s finger-tips grow dull with pain, the menial offices with which each\r\nday begins and finishes, the harsh orders that routine seems to\r\nnecessitate, the dreadful dress that makes sorrow grotesque to look at,\r\nthe silence, the solitude, the shame--each and all of these things I have\r\nto transform into a spiritual experience.  There is not a single\r\ndegradation of the body which I must not try and make into a\r\nspiritualising of the soul.\r\n\r\nI want to get to the point when I shall be able to say quite simply, and\r\nwithout affectation that the two great turning-points in my life were\r\nwhen my father sent me to Oxford, and when society sent me to prison.  I\r\nwill not say that prison is the best thing that could have happened to\r\nme: for that phrase would savour of too great bitterness towards myself.\r\nI would sooner say, or hear it said of me, that I was so typical a child\r\nof my age, that in my perversity, and for that perversity\'s sake, I\r\nturned the good things of my life to evil, and the evil things of my life\r\nto good.\r\n\r\nWhat is said, however, by myself or by others, matters little.  The\r\nimportant thing, the thing that lies before me, the thing that I have to\r\ndo, if the brief remainder of my days is not to be maimed, marred, and\r\nincomplete, is to absorb into my nature all that has been done to me, to\r\nmake it part of me, to accept it without complaint, fear, or reluctance.\r\nThe supreme vice is shallowness.  Whatever is realised is right.\r\n\r\nWhen first I was put into prison some people advised me to try and forget\r\nwho I was.  It was ruinous advice.  It is only by realising what I am\r\nthat I have found comfort of any kind.  Now I am advised by others to try\r\non my release to forget that I have ever been in a prison at all.  I know\r\nthat would be equally fatal.  It would mean that I would always be\r\nhaunted by an intolerable sense of disgrace, and that those things that\r\nare meant for me as much as for anybody else--the beauty of the sun and\r\nmoon, the pageant of the seasons, the music of daybreak and the silence\r\nof great nights, the rain falling through the leaves, or the dew creeping\r\nover the grass and making it silver--would all be tainted for me, and\r\nlose their healing power, and their power of communicating joy.  To\r\nregret one\'s own experiences is to arrest one\'s own development.  To deny\r\none\'s own experiences is to put a lie into the lips of one\'s own life.  It\r\nis no less than a denial of the soul.\r\n\r\nFor just as the body absorbs things of all kinds, things common and\r\nunclean no less than those that the priest or a vision has cleansed, and\r\nconverts them into swiftness or strength, into the play of beautiful\r\nmuscles and the moulding of fair flesh, into the curves and colours of\r\nthe hair, the lips, the eye; so the soul in its turn has its nutritive\r\nfunctions also, and can transform into noble moods of thought and\r\npassions of high import what in itself is base, cruel and degrading; nay,\r\nmore, may find in these its most august modes of assertion, and can often\r\nreveal itself most perfectly through what was intended to desecrate or\r\ndestroy.\r\n\r\nThe fact of my having been the common prisoner of a common gaol I must\r\nfrankly accept, and, curious as it may seem, one of the things I shall\r\nhave to teach myself is not to be ashamed of it.  I must accept it as a\r\npunishment, and if one is ashamed of having been punished, one might just\r\nas well never have been punished at all.  Of course there are many things\r\nof which I was convicted that I had not done, but then there are many\r\nthings of which I was convicted that I had done, and a still greater\r\nnumber of things in my life for which I was never indicted at all.  And\r\nas the gods are strange, and punish us for what is good and humane in us\r\nas much as for what is evil and perverse, I must accept the fact that one\r\nis punished for the good as well as for the evil that one does.  I have\r\nno doubt that it is quite right one should be.  It helps one, or should\r\nhelp one, to realise both, and not to be too conceited about either.  And\r\nif I then am not ashamed of my punishment, as I hope not to be, I shall\r\nbe able to think, and walk, and live with freedom.\r\n\r\nMany men on their release carry their prison about with them into the\r\nair, and hide it as a secret disgrace in their hearts, and at length,\r\nlike poor poisoned things, creep into some hole and die.  It is wretched\r\nthat they should have to do so, and it is wrong, terribly wrong, of\r\nsociety that it should force them to do so.  Society takes upon itself\r\nthe right to inflict appalling punishment on the individual, but it also\r\nhas the supreme vice of shallowness, and fails to realise what it has\r\ndone.  When the man\'s punishment is over, it leaves him to himself; that\r\nis to say, it abandons him at the very moment when its highest duty\r\ntowards him begins.  It is really ashamed of its own actions, and shuns\r\nthose whom it has punished, as people shun a creditor whose debt they\r\ncannot pay, or one on whom they have inflicted an irreparable, an\r\nirremediable wrong.  I can claim on my side that if I realise what I have\r\nsuffered, society should realise what it has inflicted on me; and that\r\nthere should be no bitterness or hate on either side.\r\n\r\nOf course I know that from one point of view things will be made\r\ndifferent for me than for others; must indeed, by the very nature of the\r\ncase, be made so.  The poor thieves and outcasts who are imprisoned here\r\nwith me are in many respects more fortunate than I am.  The little way in\r\ngrey city or green field that saw their sin is small; to find those who\r\nknow nothing of what they have done they need go no further than a bird\r\nmight fly between the twilight and the dawn; but for me the world is\r\nshrivelled to a handsbreadth, and everywhere I turn my name is written on\r\nthe rocks in lead.  For I have come, not from obscurity into the\r\nmomentary notoriety of crime, but from a sort of eternity of fame to a\r\nsort of eternity of infamy, and sometimes seem to myself to have shown,\r\nif indeed it required showing, that between the famous and the infamous\r\nthere is but one step, if as much as one.\r\n\r\nStill, in the very fact that people will recognise me wherever I go, and\r\nknow all about my life, as far as its follies go, I can discern something\r\ngood for me.  It will force on me the necessity of again asserting myself\r\nas an artist, and as soon as I possibly can.  If I can produce only one\r\nbeautiful work of art I shall be able to rob malice of its venom, and\r\ncowardice of its sneer, and to pluck out the tongue of scorn by the\r\nroots.\r\n\r\nAnd if life be, as it surely is, a problem to me, I am no less a problem\r\nto life.  People must adopt some attitude towards me, and so pass\r\njudgment, both on themselves and me.  I need not say I am not talking of\r\nparticular individuals.  The only people I would care to be with now are\r\nartists and people who have suffered: those who know what beauty is, and\r\nthose who know what sorrow is: nobody else interests me.  Nor am I making\r\nany demands on life.  In all that I have said I am simply concerned with\r\nmy own mental attitude towards life as a whole; and I feel that not to be\r\nashamed of having been punished is one of the first points I must attain\r\nto, for the sake of my own perfection, and because I am so imperfect.\r\n\r\nThen I must learn how to be happy.  Once I knew it, or thought I knew it,\r\nby instinct.  It was always springtime once in my heart.  My temperament\r\nwas akin to joy.  I filled my life to the very brim with pleasure, as one\r\nmight fill a cup to the very brim with wine.  Now I am approaching life\r\nfrom a completely new standpoint, and even to conceive happiness is often\r\nextremely difficult for me.  I remember during my first term at Oxford\r\nreading in Pater\'s _Renaissance_--that book which has had such strange\r\ninfluence over my life--how Dante places low in the Inferno those who\r\nwilfully live in sadness; and going to the college library and turning to\r\nthe passage in the _Divine Comedy_ where beneath the dreary marsh lie\r\nthose who were \'sullen in the sweet air,\' saying for ever and ever\r\nthrough their sighs--\r\n\r\n   \'Tristi fummo\r\n   Nell aer dolce che dal sol s\'allegra.\'\r\n\r\nI knew the church condemned _accidia_, but the whole idea seemed to me\r\nquite fantastic, just the sort of sin, I fancied, a priest who knew\r\nnothing about real life would invent.  Nor could I understand how Dante,\r\nwho says that \'sorrow remarries us to God,\' could have been so harsh to\r\nthose who were enamoured of melancholy, if any such there really were.  I\r\nhad no idea that some day this would become to me one of the greatest\r\ntemptations of my life.\r\n\r\nWhile I was in Wandsworth prison I longed to die.  It was my one desire.\r\nWhen after two months in the infirmary I was transferred here, and found\r\nmyself growing gradually better in physical health, I was filled with\r\nrage.  I determined to commit suicide on the very day on which I left\r\nprison.  After a time that evil mood passed away, and I made up my mind\r\nto live, but to wear gloom as a king wears purple: never to smile again:\r\nto turn whatever house I entered into a house of mourning: to make my\r\nfriends walk slowly in sadness with me: to teach them that melancholy is\r\nthe true secret of life: to maim them with an alien sorrow: to mar them\r\nwith my own pain.  Now I feel quite differently.  I see it would be both\r\nungrateful and unkind of me to pull so long a face that when my friends\r\ncame to see me they would have to make their faces still longer in order\r\nto show their sympathy; or, if I desired to entertain them, to invite\r\nthem to sit down silently to bitter herbs and funeral baked meats.  I\r\nmust learn how to be cheerful and happy.\r\n\r\nThe last two occasions on which I was allowed to see my friends here, I\r\ntried to be as cheerful as possible, and to show my cheerfulness, in\r\norder to make them some slight return for their trouble in coming all the\r\nway from town to see me.  It is only a slight return, I know, but it is\r\nthe one, I feel certain, that pleases them most.  I saw R--- for an hour\r\non Saturday week, and I tried to give the fullest possible expression of\r\nthe delight I really felt at our meeting.  And that, in the views and\r\nideas I am here shaping for myself, I am quite right is shown to me by\r\nthe fact that now for the first time since my imprisonment I have a real\r\ndesire for life.\r\n\r\nThere is before me so much to do, that I would regard it as a terrible\r\ntragedy if I died before I was allowed to complete at any rate a little\r\nof it.  I see new developments in art and life, each one of which is a\r\nfresh mode of perfection.  I long to live so that I can explore what is\r\nno less than a new world to me.  Do you want to know what this new world\r\nis?  I think you can guess what it is.  It is the world in which I have\r\nbeen living.  Sorrow, then, and all that it teaches one, is my new world.\r\n\r\nI used to live entirely for pleasure.  I shunned suffering and sorrow of\r\nevery kind.  I hated both.  I resolved to ignore them as far as possible:\r\nto treat them, that is to say, as modes of imperfection.  They were not\r\npart of my scheme of life.  They had no place in my philosophy.  My\r\nmother, who knew life as a whole, used often to quote to me Goethe\'s\r\nlines--written by Carlyle in a book he had given her years ago, and\r\ntranslated by him, I fancy, also:--\r\n\r\n   \'Who never ate his bread in sorrow,\r\n   Who never spent the midnight hours\r\n   Weeping and waiting for the morrow,--\r\n   He knows you not, ye heavenly powers.\'\r\n\r\nThey were the lines which that noble Queen of Prussia, whom Napoleon\r\ntreated with such coarse brutality, used to quote in her humiliation and\r\nexile; they were the lines my mother often quoted in the troubles of her\r\nlater life.  I absolutely declined to accept or admit the enormous truth\r\nhidden in them.  I could not understand it.  I remember quite well how I\r\nused to tell her that I did not want to eat my bread in sorrow, or to\r\npass any night weeping and watching for a more bitter dawn.\r\n\r\nI had no idea that it was one of the special things that the Fates had in\r\nstore for me: that for a whole year of my life, indeed, I was to do\r\nlittle else.  But so has my portion been meted out to me; and during the\r\nlast few months I have, after terrible difficulties and struggles, been\r\nable to comprehend some of the lessons hidden in the heart of pain.\r\nClergymen and people who use phrases without wisdom sometimes talk of\r\nsuffering as a mystery.  It is really a revelation.  One discerns things\r\none never discerned before.  One approaches the whole of history from a\r\ndifferent standpoint.  What one had felt dimly, through instinct, about\r\nart, is intellectually and emotionally realised with perfect clearness of\r\nvision and absolute intensity of apprehension.\r\n\r\nI now see that sorrow, being the supreme emotion of which man is capable,\r\nis at once the type and test of all great art.  What the artist is always\r\nlooking for is the mode of existence in which soul and body are one and\r\nindivisible: in which the outward is expressive of the inward: in which\r\nform reveals.  Of such modes of existence there are not a few: youth and\r\nthe arts preoccupied with youth may serve as a model for us at one\r\nmoment: at another we may like to think that, in its subtlety and\r\nsensitiveness of impression, its suggestion of a spirit dwelling in\r\nexternal things and making its raiment of earth and air, of mist and city\r\nalike, and in its morbid sympathy of its moods, and tones, and colours,\r\nmodern landscape art is realising for us pictorially what was realised in\r\nsuch plastic perfection by the Greeks.  Music, in which all subject is\r\nabsorbed in expression and cannot be separated from it, is a complex\r\nexample, and a flower or a child a simple example, of what I mean; but\r\nsorrow is the ultimate type both in life and art.\r\n\r\nBehind joy and laughter there may be a temperament, coarse, hard and\r\ncallous.  But behind sorrow there is always sorrow.  Pain, unlike\r\npleasure, wears no mask.  Truth in art is not any correspondence between\r\nthe essential idea and the accidental existence; it is not the\r\nresemblance of shape to shadow, or of the form mirrored in the crystal to\r\nthe form itself; it is no echo coming from a hollow hill, any more than\r\nit is a silver well of water in the valley that shows the moon to the\r\nmoon and Narcissus to Narcissus.  Truth in art is the unity of a thing\r\nwith itself: the outward rendered expressive of the inward: the soul made\r\nincarnate: the body instinct with spirit.  For this reason there is no\r\ntruth comparable to sorrow.  There are times when sorrow seems to me to\r\nbe the only truth.  Other things may be illusions of the eye or the\r\nappetite, made to blind the one and cloy the other, but out of sorrow\r\nhave the worlds been built, and at the birth of a child or a star there\r\nis pain.\r\n\r\nMore than this, there is about sorrow an intense, an extraordinary\r\nreality.  I have said of myself that I was one who stood in symbolic\r\nrelations to the art and culture of my age.  There is not a single\r\nwretched man in this wretched place along with me who does not stand in\r\nsymbolic relation to the very secret of life.  For the secret of life is\r\nsuffering.  It is what is hidden behind everything.  When we begin to\r\nlive, what is sweet is so sweet to us, and what is bitter so bitter, that\r\nwe inevitably direct all our desires towards pleasures, and seek not\r\nmerely for a \'month or twain to feed on honeycomb,\' but for all our years\r\nto taste no other food, ignorant all the while that we may really be\r\nstarving the soul.\r\n\r\nI remember talking once on this subject to one of the most beautiful\r\npersonalities I have ever known: a woman, whose sympathy and noble\r\nkindness to me, both before and since the tragedy of my imprisonment,\r\nhave been beyond power and description; one who has really assisted me,\r\nthough she does not know it, to bear the burden of my troubles more than\r\nany one else in the whole world has, and all through the mere fact of her\r\nexistence, through her being what she is--partly an ideal and partly an\r\ninfluence: a suggestion of what one might become as well as a real help\r\ntowards becoming it; a soul that renders the common air sweet, and makes\r\nwhat is spiritual seem as simple and natural as sunlight or the sea: one\r\nfor whom beauty and sorrow walk hand in hand, and have the same message.\r\nOn the occasion of which I am thinking I recall distinctly how I said to\r\nher that there was enough suffering in one narrow London lane to show\r\nthat God did not love man, and that wherever there was any sorrow, though\r\nbut that of a child, in some little garden weeping over a fault that it\r\nhad or had not committed, the whole face of creation was completely\r\nmarred.  I was entirely wrong.  She told me so, but I could not believe\r\nher.  I was not in the sphere in which such belief was to be attained to.\r\nNow it seems to me that love of some kind is the only possible\r\nexplanation of the extraordinary amount of suffering that there is in the\r\nworld.  I cannot conceive of any other explanation.  I am convinced that\r\nthere is no other, and that if the world has indeed, as I have said, been\r\nbuilt of sorrow, it has been built by the hands of love, because in no\r\nother way could the soul of man, for whom the world was made, reach the\r\nfull stature of its perfection.  Pleasure for the beautiful body, but\r\npain for the beautiful soul.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that I am convinced of these things I speak with too much\r\npride.  Far off, like a perfect pearl, one can see the city of God.  It\r\nis so wonderful that it seems as if a child could reach it in a summer\'s\r\nday.  And so a child could.  But with me and such as me it is different.\r\nOne can realise a thing in a single moment, but one loses it in the long\r\nhours that follow with leaden feet.  It is so difficult to keep \'heights\r\nthat the soul is competent to gain.\'  We think in eternity, but we move\r\nslowly through time; and how slowly time goes with us who lie in prison I\r\nneed not tell again, nor of the weariness and despair that creep back\r\ninto one\'s cell, and into the cell of one\'s heart, with such strange\r\ninsistence that one has, as it were, to garnish and sweep one\'s house for\r\ntheir coming, as for an unwelcome guest, or a bitter master, or a slave\r\nwhose slave it is one\'s chance or choice to be.\r\n\r\nAnd, though at present my friends may find it a hard thing to believe, it\r\nis true none the less, that for them living in freedom and idleness and\r\ncomfort it is more easy to learn the lessons of humility than it is for\r\nme, who begin the day by going down on my knees and washing the floor of\r\nmy cell.  For prison life with its endless privations and restrictions\r\nmakes one rebellious.  The most terrible thing about it is not that it\r\nbreaks one\'s heart--hearts are made to be broken--but that it turns one\'s\r\nheart to stone.  One sometimes feels that it is only with a front of\r\nbrass and a lip of scorn that one can get through the day at all.  And he\r\nwho is in a state of rebellion cannot receive grace, to use the phrase of\r\nwhich the Church is so fond--so rightly fond, I dare say--for in life as\r\nin art the mood of rebellion closes up the channels of the soul, and\r\nshuts out the airs of heaven.  Yet I must learn these lessons here, if I\r\nam to learn them anywhere, and must be filled with joy if my feet are on\r\nthe right road and my face set towards \'the gate which is called\r\nbeautiful,\' though I may fall many times in the mire and often in the\r\nmist go astray.\r\n\r\nThis New Life, as through my love of Dante I like sometimes to call it,\r\nis of course no new life at all, but simply the continuance, by means of\r\ndevelopment, and evolution, of my former life.  I remember when I was at\r\nOxford saying to one of my friends as we were strolling round Magdalen\'s\r\nnarrow bird-haunted walks one morning in the year before I took my\r\ndegree, that I wanted to eat of the fruit of all the trees in the garden\r\nof the world, and that I was going out into the world with that passion\r\nin my soul.  And so, indeed, I went out, and so I lived.  My only mistake\r\nwas that I confined myself so exclusively to the trees of what seemed to\r\nme the sun-lit side of the garden, and shunned the other side for its\r\nshadow and its gloom.  Failure, disgrace, poverty, sorrow, despair,\r\nsuffering, tears even, the broken words that come from lips in pain,\r\nremorse that makes one walk on thorns, conscience that condemns, self-\r\nabasement that punishes, the misery that puts ashes on its head, the\r\nanguish that chooses sack-cloth for its raiment and into its own drink\r\nputs gall:--all these were things of which I was afraid.  And as I had\r\ndetermined to know nothing of them, I was forced to taste each of them in\r\nturn, to feed on them, to have for a season, indeed, no other food at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nI don\'t regret for a single moment having lived for pleasure.  I did it\r\nto the full, as one should do everything that one does.  There was no\r\npleasure I did not experience.  I threw the pearl of my soul into a cup\r\nof wine.  I went down the primrose path to the sound of flutes.  I lived\r\non honeycomb.  But to have continued the same life would have been wrong\r\nbecause it would have been limiting.  I had to pass on.  The other half\r\nof the garden had its secrets for me also.  Of course all this is\r\nforeshadowed and prefigured in my books.  Some of it is in _The Happy\r\nPrince_, some of it in _The Young King_, notably in the passage where the\r\nbishop says to the kneeling boy, \'Is not He who made misery wiser than\r\nthou art\'? a phrase which when I wrote it seemed to me little more than a\r\nphrase; a great deal of it is hidden away in the note of doom that like a\r\npurple thread runs through the texture of _Dorian Gray_; in _The Critic\r\nas Artist_ it is set forth in many colours; in _The Soul of Man_ it is\r\nwritten down, and in letters too easy to read; it is one of the refrains\r\nwhose recurring _motifs_ make _Salome_ so like a piece of music and bind\r\nit together as a ballad; in the prose poem of the man who from the bronze\r\nof the image of the \'Pleasure that liveth for a moment\' has to make the\r\nimage of the \'Sorrow that abideth for ever\' it is incarnate.  It could\r\nnot have been otherwise.  At every single moment of one\'s life one is\r\nwhat one is going to be no less than what one has been.  Art is a symbol,\r\nbecause man is a symbol.\r\n\r\nIt is, if I can fully attain to it, the ultimate realisation of the\r\nartistic life.  For the artistic life is simply self-development.\r\nHumility in the artist is his frank acceptance of all experiences, just\r\nas love in the artist is simply the sense of beauty that reveals to the\r\nworld its body and its soul.  In _Marius the Epicurean_ Pater seeks to\r\nreconcile the artistic life with the life of religion, in the deep,\r\nsweet, and austere sense of the word.  But Marius is little more than a\r\nspectator: an ideal spectator indeed, and one to whom it is given \'to\r\ncontemplate the spectacle of life with appropriate emotions,\' which\r\nWordsworth defines as the poet\'s true aim; yet a spectator merely, and\r\nperhaps a little too much occupied with the comeliness of the benches of\r\nthe sanctuary to notice that it is the sanctuary of sorrow that he is\r\ngazing at.\r\n\r\nI see a far more intimate and immediate connection between the true life\r\nof Christ and the true life of the artist; and I take a keen pleasure in\r\nthe reflection that long before sorrow had made my days her own and bound\r\nme to her wheel I had written in _The Soul of Man_ that he who would lead\r\na Christ-like life must be entirely and absolutely himself, and had taken\r\nas my types not merely the shepherd on the hillside and the prisoner in\r\nhis cell, but also the painter to whom the world is a pageant and the\r\npoet for whom the world is a song.  I remember saying once to Andre Gide,\r\nas we sat together in some Paris _cafe_, that while meta-physics had but\r\nlittle real interest for me, and morality absolutely none, there was\r\nnothing that either Plato or Christ had said that could not be\r\ntransferred immediately into the sphere of Art and there find its\r\ncomplete fulfilment.\r\n\r\nNor is it merely that we can discern in Christ that close union of\r\npersonality with perfection which forms the real distinction between the\r\nclassical and romantic movement in life, but the very basis of his nature\r\nwas the same as that of the nature of the artist--an intense and\r\nflamelike imagination.  He realised in the entire sphere of human\r\nrelations that imaginative sympathy which in the sphere of Art is the\r\nsole secret of creation.  He understood the leprosy of the leper, the\r\ndarkness of the blind, the fierce misery of those who live for pleasure,\r\nthe strange poverty of the rich.  Some one wrote to me in trouble, \'When\r\nyou are not on your pedestal you are not interesting.\'  How remote was\r\nthe writer from what Matthew Arnold calls \'the Secret of Jesus.\'  Either\r\nwould have taught him that whatever happens to another happens to\r\noneself, and if you want an inscription to read at dawn and at\r\nnight-time, and for pleasure or for pain, write up on the walls of your\r\nhouse in letters for the sun to gild and the moon to silver, \'Whatever\r\nhappens to oneself happens to another.\'\r\n\r\nChrist\'s place indeed is with the poets.  His whole conception of\r\nHumanity sprang right out of the imagination and can only be realised by\r\nit.  What God was to the pantheist, man was to Him.  He was the first to\r\nconceive the divided races as a unity.  Before his time there had been\r\ngods and men, and, feeling through the mysticism of sympathy that in\r\nhimself each had been made incarnate, he calls himself the Son of the one\r\nor the Son of the other, according to his mood.  More than any one else\r\nin history he wakes in us that temper of wonder to which romance always\r\nappeals.  There is still something to me almost incredible in the idea of\r\na young Galilean peasant imagining that he could bear on his own\r\nshoulders the burden of the entire world; all that had already been done\r\nand suffered, and all that was yet to be done and suffered: the sins of\r\nNero, of Caesar Borgia, of Alexander VI., and of him who was Emperor of\r\nRome and Priest of the Sun: the sufferings of those whose names are\r\nlegion and whose dwelling is among the tombs: oppressed nationalities,\r\nfactory children, thieves, people in prison, outcasts, those who are dumb\r\nunder oppression and whose silence is heard only of God; and not merely\r\nimagining this but actually achieving it, so that at the present moment\r\nall who come in contact with his personality, even though they may\r\nneither bow to his altar nor kneel before his priest, in some way find\r\nthat the ugliness of their sin is taken away and the beauty of their\r\nsorrow revealed to them.\r\n\r\nI had said of Christ that he ranks with the poets.  That is true.  Shelley\r\nand Sophocles are of his company.  But his entire life also is the most\r\nwonderful of poems.  For \'pity and terror\' there is nothing in the entire\r\ncycle of Greek tragedy to touch it.  The absolute purity of the\r\nprotagonist raises the entire scheme to a height of romantic art from\r\nwhich the sufferings of Thebes and Pelops\' line are by their very horror\r\nexcluded, and shows how wrong Aristotle was when he said in his treatise\r\non the drama that it would be impossible to bear the spectacle of one\r\nblameless in pain.  Nor in AEschylus nor Dante, those stern masters of\r\ntenderness, in Shakespeare, the most purely human of all the great\r\nartists, in the whole of Celtic myth and legend, where the loveliness of\r\nthe world is shown through a mist of tears, and the life of a man is no\r\nmore than the life of a flower, is there anything that, for sheer\r\nsimplicity of pathos wedded and made one with sublimity of tragic effect,\r\ncan be said to equal or even approach the last act of Christ\'s passion.\r\nThe little supper with his companions, one of whom has already sold him\r\nfor a price; the anguish in the quiet moon-lit garden; the false friend\r\ncoming close to him so as to betray him with a kiss; the friend who still\r\nbelieved in him, and on whom as on a rock he had hoped to build a house\r\nof refuge for Man, denying him as the bird cried to the dawn; his own\r\nutter loneliness, his submission, his acceptance of everything; and along\r\nwith it all such scenes as the high priest of orthodoxy rending his\r\nraiment in wrath, and the magistrate of civil justice calling for water\r\nin the vain hope of cleansing himself of that stain of innocent blood\r\nthat makes him the scarlet figure of history; the coronation ceremony of\r\nsorrow, one of the most wonderful things in the whole of recorded time;\r\nthe crucifixion of the Innocent One before the eyes of his mother and of\r\nthe disciple whom he loved; the soldiers gambling and throwing dice for\r\nhis clothes; the terrible death by which he gave the world its most\r\neternal symbol; and his final burial in the tomb of the rich man, his\r\nbody swathed in Egyptian linen with costly spices and perfumes as though\r\nhe had been a king\'s son.  When one contemplates all this from the point\r\nof view of art alone one cannot but be grateful that the supreme office\r\nof the Church should be the playing of the tragedy without the shedding\r\nof blood: the mystical presentation, by means of dialogue and costume and\r\ngesture even, of the Passion of her Lord; and it is always a source of\r\npleasure and awe to me to remember that the ultimate survival of the\r\nGreek chorus, lost elsewhere to art, is to be found in the servitor\r\nanswering the priest at Mass.\r\n\r\nYet the whole life of Christ--so entirely may sorrow and beauty be made\r\none in their meaning and manifestation--is really an idyll, though it\r\nends with the veil of the temple being rent, and the darkness coming over\r\nthe face of the earth, and the stone rolled to the door of the sepulchre.\r\nOne always thinks of him as a young bridegroom with his companions, as\r\nindeed he somewhere describes himself; as a shepherd straying through a\r\nvalley with his sheep in search of green meadow or cool stream; as a\r\nsinger trying to build out of the music the walls of the City of God; or\r\nas a lover for whose love the whole world was too small.  His miracles\r\nseem to me to be as exquisite as the coming of spring, and quite as\r\nnatural.  I see no difficulty at all in believing that such was the charm\r\nof his personality that his mere presence could bring peace to souls in\r\nanguish, and that those who touched his garments or his hands forgot\r\ntheir pain; or that as he passed by on the highway of life people who had\r\nseen nothing of life\'s mystery, saw it clearly, and others who had been\r\ndeaf to every voice but that of pleasure heard for the first time the\r\nvoice of love and found it as \'musical as Apollo\'s lute\'; or that evil\r\npassions fled at his approach, and men whose dull unimaginative lives had\r\nbeen but a mode of death rose as it were from the grave when he called\r\nthem; or that when he taught on the hillside the multitude forgot their\r\nhunger and thirst and the cares of this world, and that to his friends\r\nwho listened to him as he sat at meat the coarse food seemed delicate,\r\nand the water had the taste of good wine, and the whole house became full\r\nof the odour and sweetness of nard.\r\n\r\nRenan in his _Vie de Jesus_--that gracious fifth gospel, the gospel\r\naccording to St. Thomas, one might call it--says somewhere that Christ\'s\r\ngreat achievement was that he made himself as much loved after his death\r\nas he had been during his lifetime.  And certainly, if his place is among\r\nthe poets, he is the leader of all the lovers.  He saw that love was the\r\nfirst secret of the world for which the wise men had been looking, and\r\nthat it was only through love that one could approach either the heart of\r\nthe leper or the feet of God.\r\n\r\nAnd above all, Christ is the most supreme of individualists.  Humility,\r\nlike the artistic, acceptance of all experiences, is merely a mode of\r\nmanifestation.  It is man\'s soul that Christ is always looking for.  He\r\ncalls it \'God\'s Kingdom,\' and finds it in every one.  He compares it to\r\nlittle things, to a tiny seed, to a handful of leaven, to a pearl.  That\r\nis because one realises one\'s soul only by getting rid of all alien\r\npassions, all acquired culture, and all external possessions, be they\r\ngood or evil.\r\n\r\nI bore up against everything with some stubbornness of will and much\r\nrebellion of nature, till I had absolutely nothing left in the world but\r\none thing.  I had lost my name, my position, my happiness, my freedom, my\r\nwealth.  I was a prisoner and a pauper.  But I still had my children\r\nleft.  Suddenly they were taken away from me by the law.  It was a blow\r\nso appalling that I did not know what to do, so I flung myself on my\r\nknees, and bowed my head, and wept, and said, \'The body of a child is as\r\nthe body of the Lord: I am not worthy of either.\'  That moment seemed to\r\nsave me.  I saw then that the only thing for me was to accept everything.\r\nSince then--curious as it will no doubt sound--I have been happier.  It\r\nwas of course my soul in its ultimate essence that I had reached.  In\r\nmany ways I had been its enemy, but I found it waiting for me as a\r\nfriend.  When one comes in contact with the soul it makes one simple as a\r\nchild, as Christ said one should be.\r\n\r\nIt is tragic how few people ever \'possess their souls\' before they die.\r\n\'Nothing is more rare in any man,\' says Emerson, \'than an act of his\r\nown.\'  It is quite true.  Most people are other people.  Their thoughts\r\nare some one else\'s opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions a\r\nquotation.  Christ was not merely the supreme individualist, but he was\r\nthe first individualist in history.  People have tried to make him out an\r\nordinary philanthropist, or ranked him as an altruist with the scientific\r\nand sentimental.  But he was really neither one nor the other.  Pity he\r\nhas, of course, for the poor, for those who are shut up in prisons, for\r\nthe lowly, for the wretched; but he has far more pity for the rich, for\r\nthe hard hedonists, for those who waste their freedom in becoming slaves\r\nto things, for those who wear soft raiment and live in kings\' houses.\r\nRiches and pleasure seemed to him to be really greater tragedies than\r\npoverty or sorrow.  And as for altruism, who knew better than he that it\r\nis vocation not volition that determines us, and that one cannot gather\r\ngrapes of thorns or figs from thistles?\r\n\r\nTo live for others as a definite self-conscious aim was not his creed.  It\r\nwas not the basis of his creed.  When he says, \'Forgive your enemies,\' it\r\nis not for the sake of the enemy, but for one\'s own sake that he says so,\r\nand because love is more beautiful than hate.  In his own entreaty to the\r\nyoung man, \'Sell all that thou hast and give to the poor,\' it is not of\r\nthe state of the poor that he is thinking but of the soul of the young\r\nman, the soul that wealth was marring.  In his view of life he is one\r\nwith the artist who knows that by the inevitable law of self-perfection,\r\nthe poet must sing, and the sculptor think in bronze, and the painter\r\nmake the world a mirror for his moods, as surely and as certainly as the\r\nhawthorn must blossom in spring, and the corn turn to gold at harvest-\r\ntime, and the moon in her ordered wanderings change from shield to\r\nsickle, and from sickle to shield.\r\n\r\nBut while Christ did not say to men, \'Live for others,\' he pointed out\r\nthat there was no difference at all between the lives of others and one\'s\r\nown life.  By this means he gave to man an extended, a Titan personality.\r\nSince his coming the history of each separate individual is, or can be\r\nmade, the history of the world.  Of course, culture has intensified the\r\npersonality of man.  Art has made us myriad-minded.  Those who have the\r\nartistic temperament go into exile with Dante and learn how salt is the\r\nbread of others, and how steep their stairs; they catch for a moment the\r\nserenity and calm of Goethe, and yet know but too well that Baudelaire\r\ncried to God--\r\n\r\n   \'O Seigneur, donnez moi la force et le courage\r\n   De contempler mon corps et mon coeur sans degout.\'\r\n\r\nOut of Shakespeare\'s sonnets they draw, to their own hurt it may be, the\r\nsecret of his love and make it their own; they look with new eyes on\r\nmodern life, because they have listened to one of Chopin\'s nocturnes, or\r\nhandled Greek things, or read the story of the passion of some dead man\r\nfor some dead woman whose hair was like threads of fine gold, and whose\r\nmouth was as a pomegranate.  But the sympathy of the artistic temperament\r\nis necessarily with what has found expression.  In words or in colours,\r\nin music or in marble, behind the painted masks of an AEschylean play, or\r\nthrough some Sicilian shepherds\' pierced and jointed reeds, the man and\r\nhis message must have been revealed.\r\n\r\nTo the artist, expression is the only mode under which he can conceive\r\nlife at all.  To him what is dumb is dead.  But to Christ it was not so.\r\nWith a width and wonder of imagination that fills one almost with awe, he\r\ntook the entire world of the inarticulate, the voiceless world of pain,\r\nas his kingdom, and made of himself its eternal mouthpiece.  Those of\r\nwhom I have spoken, who are dumb under oppression, and \'whose silence is\r\nheard only of God,\' he chose as his brothers.  He sought to become eyes\r\nto the blind, ears to the deaf, and a cry in the lips of those whose\r\ntongues had been tied.  His desire was to be to the myriads who had found\r\nno utterance a very trumpet through which they might call to heaven.  And\r\nfeeling, with the artistic nature of one to whom suffering and sorrow\r\nwere modes through which he could realise his conception of the\r\nbeautiful, that an idea is of no value till it becomes incarnate and is\r\nmade an image, he made of himself the image of the Man of Sorrows, and as\r\nsuch has fascinated and dominated art as no Greek god ever succeeded in\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nFor the Greek gods, in spite of the white and red of their fair fleet\r\nlimbs, were not really what they appeared to be.  The curved brow of\r\nApollo was like the sun\'s disc crescent over a hill at dawn, and his feet\r\nwere as the wings of the morning, but he himself had been cruel to\r\nMarsyas and had made Niobe childless.  In the steel shields of Athena\'s\r\neyes there had been no pity for Arachne; the pomp and peacocks of Hera\r\nwere all that was really noble about her; and the Father of the Gods\r\nhimself had been too fond of the daughters of men.  The two most deeply\r\nsuggestive figures of Greek Mythology were, for religion, Demeter, an\r\nEarth Goddess, not one of the Olympians, and for art, Dionysus, the son\r\nof a mortal woman to whom the moment of his birth had proved also the\r\nmoment of her death.\r\n\r\nBut Life itself from its lowliest and most humble sphere produced one far\r\nmore marvellous than the mother of Proserpina or the son of Semele.  Out\r\nof the Carpenter\'s shop at Nazareth had come a personality infinitely\r\ngreater than any made by myth and legend, and one, strangely enough,\r\ndestined to reveal to the world the mystical meaning of wine and the real\r\nbeauties of the lilies of the field as none, either on Cithaeron or at\r\nEnna, had ever done.\r\n\r\nThe song of Isaiah, \'He is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows\r\nand acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him,\' had\r\nseemed to him to prefigure himself, and in him the prophecy was\r\nfulfilled.  We must not be afraid of such a phrase.  Every single work of\r\nart is the fulfilment of a prophecy: for every work of art is the\r\nconversion of an idea into an image.  Every single human being should be\r\nthe fulfilment of a prophecy: for every human being should be the\r\nrealisation of some ideal, either in the mind of God or in the mind of\r\nman.  Christ found the type and fixed it, and the dream of a Virgilian\r\npoet, either at Jerusalem or at Babylon, became in the long progress of\r\nthe centuries incarnate in him for whom the world was waiting.\r\n\r\nTo me one of the things in history the most to be regretted is that the\r\nChrist\'s own renaissance, which has produced the Cathedral at Chartres,\r\nthe Arthurian cycle of legends, the life of St. Francis of Assisi, the\r\nart of Giotto, and Dante\'s _Divine Comedy_, was not allowed to develop on\r\nits own lines, but was interrupted and spoiled by the dreary classical\r\nRenaissance that gave us Petrarch, and Raphael\'s frescoes, and Palladian\r\narchitecture, and formal French tragedy, and St. Paul\'s Cathedral, and\r\nPope\'s poetry, and everything that is made from without and by dead\r\nrules, and does not spring from within through some spirit informing it.\r\nBut wherever there is a romantic movement in art there somehow, and under\r\nsome form, is Christ, or the soul of Christ.  He is in _Romeo and\r\nJuliet_, in the _Winter\'s Tale_, in Provencal poetry, in the _Ancient\r\nMariner_, in _La Belle Dame sans merci_, and in Chatterton\'s _Ballad of\r\nCharity_.\r\n\r\nWe owe to him the most diverse things and people.  Hugo\'s _Les\r\nMiserables_, Baudelaire\'s _Fleurs du Mal_, the note of pity in Russian\r\nnovels, Verlaine and Verlaine\'s poems, the stained glass and tapestries\r\nand the quattro-cento work of Burne-Jones and Morris, belong to him no\r\nless than the tower of Giotto, Lancelot and Guinevere, Tannhauser, the\r\ntroubled romantic marbles of Michael Angelo, pointed architecture, and\r\nthe love of children and flowers--for both of which, indeed, in classical\r\nart there was but little place, hardly enough for them to grow or play\r\nin, but which, from the twelfth century down to our own day, have been\r\ncontinually making their appearances in art, under various modes and at\r\nvarious times, coming fitfully and wilfully, as children, as flowers, are\r\napt to do: spring always seeming to one as if the flowers had been in\r\nhiding, and only came out into the sun because they were afraid that\r\ngrown up people would grow tired of looking for them and give up the\r\nsearch; and the life of a child being no more than an April day on which\r\nthere is both rain and sun for the narcissus.\r\n\r\nIt is the imaginative quality of Christ\'s own nature that makes him this\r\npalpitating centre of romance.  The strange figures of poetic drama and\r\nballad are made by the imagination of others, but out of his own\r\nimagination entirely did Jesus of Nazareth create himself.  The cry of\r\nIsaiah had really no more to do with his coming than the song of the\r\nnightingale has to do with the rising of the moon--no more, though\r\nperhaps no less.  He was the denial as well as the affirmation of\r\nprophecy.  For every expectation that he fulfilled there was another that\r\nhe destroyed.  \'In all beauty,\' says Bacon, \'there is some strangeness of\r\nproportion,\' and of those who are born of the spirit--of those, that is\r\nto say, who like himself are dynamic forces--Christ says that they are\r\nlike the wind that \'bloweth where it listeth, and no man can tell whence\r\nit cometh and whither it goeth.\'  That is why he is so fascinating to\r\nartists.  He has all the colour elements of life: mystery, strangeness,\r\npathos, suggestion, ecstasy, love.  He appeals to the temper of wonder,\r\nand creates that mood in which alone he can be understood.\r\n\r\nAnd to me it is a joy to remember that if he is \'of imagination all\r\ncompact,\' the world itself is of the same substance.  I said in _Dorian\r\nGray_ that the great sins of the world take place in the brain: but it is\r\nin the brain that everything takes place.  We know now that we do not see\r\nwith the eyes or hear with the ears.  They are really channels for the\r\ntransmission, adequate or inadequate, of sense impressions.  It is in the\r\nbrain that the poppy is red, that the apple is odorous, that the skylark\r\nsings.\r\n\r\nOf late I have been studying with diligence the four prose poems about\r\nChrist.  At Christmas I managed to get hold of a Greek Testament, and\r\nevery morning, after I had cleaned my cell and polished my tins, I read a\r\nlittle of the Gospels, a dozen verses taken by chance anywhere.  It is a\r\ndelightful way of opening the day.  Every one, even in a turbulent, ill-\r\ndisciplined life, should do the same.  Endless repetition, in and out of\r\nseason, has spoiled for us the freshness, the naivete, the simple\r\nromantic charm of the Gospels.  We hear them read far too often and far\r\ntoo badly, and all repetition is anti-spiritual.  When one returns to the\r\nGreek; it is like going into a garden of lilies out of some, narrow and\r\ndark house.\r\n\r\nAnd to me, the pleasure is doubled by the reflection that it is extremely\r\nprobable that we have the actual terms, the _ipsissima verba_, used by\r\nChrist.  It was always supposed that Christ talked in Aramaic.  Even\r\nRenan thought so.  But now we know that the Galilean peasants, like the\r\nIrish peasants of our own day, were bilingual, and that Greek was the\r\nordinary language of intercourse all over Palestine, as indeed all over\r\nthe Eastern world.  I never liked the idea that we knew of Christ\'s own\r\nwords only through a translation of a translation.  It is a delight to me\r\nto think that as far as his conversation was concerned, Charmides might\r\nhave listened to him, and Socrates reasoned with him, and Plato\r\nunderstood him: that he really said [Greek text], that when he thought of\r\nthe lilies of the field and how they neither toil nor spin, his absolute\r\nexpression was [Greek text], and that his last word when he cried out \'my\r\nlife has been completed, has reached its fulfilment, has been perfected,\'\r\nwas exactly as St. John tells us it was: [Greek text]--no more.\r\n\r\nWhile in reading the Gospels--particularly that of St. John himself, or\r\nwhatever early Gnostic took his name and mantle--I see the continual\r\nassertion of the imagination as the basis of all spiritual and material\r\nlife, I see also that to Christ imagination was simply a form of love,\r\nand that to him love was lord in the fullest meaning of the phrase.  Some\r\nsix weeks ago I was allowed by the doctor to have white bread to eat\r\ninstead of the coarse black or brown bread of ordinary prison fare.  It\r\nis a great delicacy.  It will sound strange that dry bread could possibly\r\nbe a delicacy to any one.  To me it is so much so that at the close of\r\neach meal I carefully eat whatever crumbs may be left on my tin plate, or\r\nhave fallen on the rough towel that one uses as a cloth so as not to soil\r\none\'s table; and I do so not from hunger--I get now quite sufficient\r\nfood--but simply in order that nothing should be wasted of what is given\r\nto me.  So one should look on love.\r\n\r\nChrist, like all fascinating personalities, had the power of not merely\r\nsaying beautiful things himself, but of making other people say beautiful\r\nthings to him; and I love the story St. Mark tells us about the Greek\r\nwoman, who, when as a trial of her faith he said to her that he could not\r\ngive her the bread of the children of Israel, answered him that the\r\nlittle dogs--([Greek text], \'little dogs\' it should be rendered)--who are\r\nunder the table eat of the crumbs that the children let fall.  Most\r\npeople live for love and admiration.  But it is by love and admiration\r\nthat we should live.  If any love is shown us we should recognise that we\r\nare quite unworthy of it.  Nobody is worthy to be loved.  The fact that\r\nGod loves man shows us that in the divine order of ideal things it is\r\nwritten that eternal love is to be given to what is eternally unworthy.\r\nOr if that phrase seems to be a bitter one to bear, let us say that every\r\none is worthy of love, except him who thinks that he is.  Love is a\r\nsacrament that should be taken kneeling, and _Domine, non sum dignus_\r\nshould be on the lips and in the hearts of those who receive it.\r\n\r\nIf ever I write again, in the sense of producing artistic work, there are\r\njust two subjects on which and through which I desire to express myself:\r\none is \'Christ as the precursor of the romantic movement in life\': the\r\nother is \'The artistic life considered in its relation to conduct.\'  The\r\nfirst is, of course, intensely fascinating, for I see in Christ not\r\nmerely the essentials of the supreme romantic type, but all the\r\naccidents, the wilfulnesses even, of the romantic temperament also.  He\r\nwas the first person who ever said to people that they should live\r\n\'flower-like lives.\'  He fixed the phrase.  He took children as the type\r\nof what people should try to become.  He held them up as examples to\r\ntheir elders, which I myself have always thought the chief use of\r\nchildren, if what is perfect should have a use.  Dante describes the soul\r\nof a man as coming from the hand of God \'weeping and laughing like a\r\nlittle child,\' and Christ also saw that the soul of each one should be _a\r\nguisa di fanciulla che piangendo e ridendo pargoleggia_.  He felt that\r\nlife was changeful, fluid, active, and that to allow it to be stereotyped\r\ninto any form was death.  He saw that people should not be too serious\r\nover material, common interests: that to be unpractical was to be a great\r\nthing: that one should not bother too much over affairs.  The birds\r\ndidn\'t, why should man?  He is charming when he says, \'Take no thought\r\nfor the morrow; is not the soul more than meat? is not the body more than\r\nraiment?\'  A Greek might have used the latter phrase.  It is full of\r\nGreek feeling.  But only Christ could have said both, and so summed up\r\nlife perfectly for us.\r\n\r\nHis morality is all sympathy, just what morality should be.  If the only\r\nthing that he ever said had been, \'Her sins are forgiven her because she\r\nloved much,\' it would have been worth while dying to have said it.  His\r\njustice is all poetical justice, exactly what justice should be.  The\r\nbeggar goes to heaven because he has been unhappy.  I cannot conceive a\r\nbetter reason for his being sent there.  The people who work for an hour\r\nin the vineyard in the cool of the evening receive just as much reward as\r\nthose who have toiled there all day long in the hot sun.  Why shouldn\'t\r\nthey?  Probably no one deserved anything.  Or perhaps they were a\r\ndifferent kind of people.  Christ had no patience with the dull lifeless\r\nmechanical systems that treat people as if they were things, and so treat\r\neverybody alike: for him there were no laws: there were exceptions\r\nmerely, as if anybody, or anything, for that matter, was like aught else\r\nin the world!\r\n\r\nThat which is the very keynote of romantic art was to him the proper\r\nbasis of natural life.  He saw no other basis.  And when they brought him\r\none, taken in the very act of sin and showed him her sentence written in\r\nthe law, and asked him what was to be done, he wrote with his finger on\r\nthe ground as though he did not hear them, and finally, when they pressed\r\nhim again, looked up and said, \'Let him of you who has never sinned be\r\nthe first to throw the stone at her.\'  It was worth while living to have\r\nsaid that.\r\n\r\nLike all poetical natures he loved ignorant people.  He knew that in the\r\nsoul of one who is ignorant there is always room for a great idea.  But\r\nhe could not stand stupid people, especially those who are made stupid by\r\neducation: people who are full of opinions not one of which they even\r\nunderstand, a peculiarly modern type, summed up by Christ when he\r\ndescribes it as the type of one who has the key of knowledge, cannot use\r\nit himself, and does not allow other people to use it, though it may be\r\nmade to open the gate of God\'s Kingdom.  His chief war was against the\r\nPhilistines.  That is the war every child of light has to wage.\r\nPhilistinism was the note of the age and community in which he lived.  In\r\ntheir heavy inaccessibility to ideas, their dull respectability, their\r\ntedious orthodoxy, their worship of vulgar success, their entire\r\npreoccupation with the gross materialistic side of life, and their\r\nridiculous estimate of themselves and their importance, the Jews of\r\nJerusalem in Christ\'s day were the exact counterpart of the British\r\nPhilistine of our own.  Christ mocked at the \'whited sepulchre\' of\r\nrespectability, and fixed that phrase for ever.  He treated worldly\r\nsuccess as a thing absolutely to be despised.  He saw nothing in it at\r\nall.  He looked on wealth as an encumbrance to a man.  He would not hear\r\nof life being sacrificed to any system of thought or morals.  He pointed\r\nout that forms and ceremonies were made for man, not man for forms and\r\nceremonies.  He took sabbatarianism as a type of the things that should\r\nbe set at nought.  The cold philanthropies, the ostentatious public\r\ncharities, the tedious formalisms so dear to the middle-class mind, he\r\nexposed with utter and relentless scorn.  To us, what is termed orthodoxy\r\nis merely a facile unintelligent acquiescence; but to them, and in their\r\nhands, it was a terrible and paralysing tyranny.  Christ swept it aside.\r\nHe showed that the spirit alone was of value.  He took a keen pleasure in\r\npointing out to them that though they were always reading the law and the\r\nprophets, they had not really the smallest idea of what either of them\r\nmeant.  In opposition to their tithing of each separate day into the\r\nfixed routine of prescribed duties, as they tithe mint and rue, he\r\npreached the enormous importance of living completely for the moment.\r\n\r\nThose whom he saved from their sins are saved simply for beautiful\r\nmoments in their lives.  Mary Magdalen, when she sees Christ, breaks the\r\nrich vase of alabaster that one of her seven lovers had given her, and\r\nspills the odorous spices over his tired dusty feet, and for that one\r\nmoment\'s sake sits for ever with Ruth and Beatrice in the tresses of the\r\nsnow-white rose of Paradise.  All that Christ says to us by the way of a\r\nlittle warning is that every moment should be beautiful, that the soul\r\nshould always be ready for the coming of the bridegroom, always waiting\r\nfor the voice of the lover, Philistinism being simply that side of man\'s\r\nnature that is not illumined by the imagination.  He sees all the lovely\r\ninfluences of life as modes of light: the imagination itself is the world\r\nof light.  The world is made by it, and yet the world cannot understand\r\nit: that is because the imagination is simply a manifestation of love,\r\nand it is love and the capacity for it that distinguishes one human being\r\nfrom another.\r\n\r\nBut it is when he deals with a sinner that Christ is most romantic, in\r\nthe sense of most real.  The world had always loved the saint as being\r\nthe nearest possible approach to the perfection of God.  Christ, through\r\nsome divine instinct in him, seems to have always loved the sinner as\r\nbeing the nearest possible approach to the perfection of man.  His\r\nprimary desire was not to reform people, any more than his primary desire\r\nwas to a relieve suffering.  To turn an interesting thief into a tedious\r\nhonest man was not his aim.  He would have thought little of the\r\nPrisoners\' Aid Society and other modern movements of the kind.  The\r\nconversion of a publican into a Pharisee would not have seemed to him a\r\ngreat achievement.  But in a manner not yet understood of the world he\r\nregarded sin and suffering as being in themselves beautiful holy things\r\nand modes of perfection.\r\n\r\nIt seems a very dangerous idea.  It is--all great ideas are dangerous.\r\nThat it was Christ\'s creed admits of no doubt.  That it is the true creed\r\nI don\'t doubt myself.\r\n\r\nOf course the sinner must repent.  But why?  Simply because otherwise he\r\nwould be unable to realise what he had done.  The moment of repentance is\r\nthe moment of initiation.  More than that: it is the means by which one\r\nalters one\'s past.  The Greeks thought that impossible.  They often say\r\nin their Gnomic aphorisms, \'Even the Gods cannot alter the past.\'  Christ\r\nshowed that the commonest sinner could do it, that it was the one thing\r\nhe could do.  Christ, had he been asked, would have said--I feel quite\r\ncertain about it--that the moment the prodigal son fell on his knees and\r\nwept, he made his having wasted his substance with harlots, his swine-\r\nherding and hungering for the husks they ate, beautiful and holy moments\r\nin his life.  It is difficult for most people to grasp the idea.  I dare\r\nsay one has to go to prison to understand it.  If so, it may be worth\r\nwhile going to prison.\r\n\r\nThere is something so unique about Christ.  Of course just as there are\r\nfalse dawns before the dawn itself, and winter days so full of sudden\r\nsunlight that they will cheat the wise crocus into squandering its gold\r\nbefore its time, and make some foolish bird call to its mate to build on\r\nbarren boughs, so there were Christians before Christ.  For that we\r\nshould be grateful.  The unfortunate thing is that there have been none\r\nsince.  I make one exception, St. Francis of Assisi.  But then God had\r\ngiven him at his birth the soul of a poet, as he himself when quite young\r\nhad in mystical marriage taken poverty as his bride: and with the soul of\r\na poet and the body of a beggar he found the way to perfection not\r\ndifficult.  He understood Christ, and so he became like him.  We do not\r\nrequire the Liber Conformitatum to teach us that the life of St. Francis\r\nwas the true _Imitatio Christi_, a poem compared to which the book of\r\nthat name is merely prose.\r\n\r\nIndeed, that is the charm about Christ, when all is said: he is just like\r\na work of art.  He does not really teach one anything, but by being\r\nbrought into his presence one becomes something.  And everybody is\r\npredestined to his presence.  Once at least in his life each man walks\r\nwith Christ to Emmaus.\r\n\r\nAs regards the other subject, the Relation of the Artistic Life to\r\nConduct, it will no doubt seem strange to you that I should select it.\r\nPeople point to Reading Gaol and say, \'That is where the artistic life\r\nleads a man.\'  Well, it might lead to worse places.  The more mechanical\r\npeople to whom life is a shrewd speculation depending on a careful\r\ncalculation of ways and means, always know where they are going, and go\r\nthere.  They start with the ideal desire of being the parish beadle, and\r\nin whatever sphere they are placed they succeed in being the parish\r\nbeadle and no more.  A man whose desire is to be something separate from\r\nhimself, to be a member of Parliament, or a successful grocer, or a\r\nprominent solicitor, or a judge, or something equally tedious, invariably\r\nsucceeds in being what he wants to be.  That is his punishment.  Those\r\nwho want a mask have to wear it.\r\n\r\nBut with the dynamic forces of life, and those in whom those dynamic\r\nforces become incarnate, it is different.  People whose desire is solely\r\nfor self-realisation never know where they are going.  They can\'t know.\r\nIn one sense of the word it is of course necessary, as the Greek oracle\r\nsaid, to know oneself: that is the first achievement of knowledge.  But\r\nto recognise that the soul of a man is unknowable, is the ultimate\r\nachievement of wisdom.  The final mystery is oneself.  When one has\r\nweighed the sun in the balance, and measured the steps of the moon, and\r\nmapped out the seven heavens star by star, there still remains oneself.\r\nWho can calculate the orbit of his own soul?  When the son went out to\r\nlook for his father\'s asses, he did not know that a man of God was\r\nwaiting for him with the very chrism of coronation, and that his own soul\r\nwas already the soul of a king.\r\n\r\nI hope to live long enough and to produce work of such a character that I\r\nshall be able at the end of my days to say, \'Yes! this is just where the\r\nartistic life leads a man!\'  Two of the most perfect lives I have come\r\nacross in my own experience are the lives of Verlaine and of Prince\r\nKropotkin: both of them men who have passed years in prison: the first,\r\nthe one Christian poet since Dante; the other, a man with a soul of that\r\nbeautiful white Christ which seems coming out of Russia.  And for the\r\nlast seven or eight months, in spite of a succession of great troubles\r\nreaching me from the outside world almost without intermission, I have\r\nbeen placed in direct contact with a new spirit working in this prison\r\nthrough man and things, that has helped me beyond any possibility of\r\nexpression in words: so that while for the first year of my imprisonment\r\nI did nothing else, and can remember doing nothing else, but wring my\r\nhands in impotent despair, and say, \'What an ending, what an appalling\r\nending!\' now I try to say to myself, and sometimes when I am not\r\ntorturing myself do really and sincerely say, \'What a beginning, what a\r\nwonderful beginning!\'  It may really be so.  It may become so.  If it\r\ndoes I shall owe much to this new personality that has altered every\r\nman\'s life in this place.\r\n\r\nYou may realise it when I say that had I been released last May, as I\r\ntried to be, I would have left this place loathing it and every official\r\nin it with a bitterness of hatred that would have poisoned my life.  I\r\nhave had a year longer of imprisonment, but humanity has been in the\r\nprison along with us all, and now when I go out I shall always remember\r\ngreat kindnesses that I have received here from almost everybody, and on\r\nthe day of my release I shall give many thanks to many people, and ask to\r\nbe remembered by them in turn.\r\n\r\nThe prison style is absolutely and entirely wrong.  I would give anything\r\nto be able to alter it when I go out.  I intend to try.  But there is\r\nnothing in the world so wrong but that the spirit of humanity, which is\r\nthe spirit of love, the spirit of the Christ who is not in churches, may\r\nmake it, if not right, at least possible to be borne without too much\r\nbitterness of heart.\r\n\r\nI know also that much is waiting for me outside that is very delightful,\r\nfrom what St. Francis of Assisi calls \'my brother the wind, and my sister\r\nthe rain,\' lovely things both of them, down to the shop-windows and\r\nsunsets of great cities.  If I made a list of all that still remains to\r\nme, I don\'t know where I should stop: for, indeed, God made the world\r\njust as much for me as for any one else.  Perhaps I may go out with\r\nsomething that I had not got before.  I need not tell you that to me\r\nreformations in morals are as meaningless and vulgar as Reformations in\r\ntheology.  But while to propose to be a better man is a piece of\r\nunscientific cant, to have become a deeper man is the privilege of those\r\nwho have suffered.  And such I think I have become.\r\n\r\nIf after I am free a friend of mine gave a feast, and did not invite me\r\nto it, I should not mind a bit.  I can be perfectly happy by myself.  With\r\nfreedom, flowers, books, and the moon, who could not be perfectly happy?\r\nBesides, feasts are not for me any more.  I have given too many to care\r\nabout them.  That side of life is over for me, very fortunately, I dare\r\nsay.  But if after I am free a friend of mine had a sorrow and refused to\r\nallow me to share it, I should feel it most bitterly.  If he shut the\r\ndoors of the house of mourning against me, I would come back again and\r\nagain and beg to be admitted, so that I might share in what I was\r\nentitled to share in.  If he thought me unworthy, unfit to weep with him,\r\nI should feel it as the most poignant humiliation, as the most terrible\r\nmode in which disgrace could be inflicted on me.  But that could not be.\r\nI have a right to share in sorrow, and he who can look at the loveliness\r\nof the world and share its sorrow, and realise something of the wonder of\r\nboth, is in immediate contact with divine things, and has got as near to\r\nGod\'s secret as any one can get.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there may come into my art also, no less than into my life, a\r\nstill deeper note, one of greater unity of passion, and directness of\r\nimpulse.  Not width but intensity is the true aim of modern art.  We are\r\nno longer in art concerned with the type.  It is with the exception that\r\nwe have to do.  I cannot put my sufferings into any form they took, I\r\nneed hardly say.  Art only begins where Imitation ends, but something\r\nmust come into my work, of fuller memory of words perhaps, of richer\r\ncadences, of more curious effects, of simpler architectural order, of\r\nsome aesthetic quality at any rate.\r\n\r\nWhen Marsyas was \'torn from the scabbard of his limbs\'--_della vagina\r\ndella membre sue_, to use one of Dante\'s most terrible Tacitean\r\nphrases--he had no more song, the Greek said.  Apollo had been victor.\r\nThe lyre had vanquished the reed.  But perhaps the Greeks were mistaken.\r\nI hear in much modern Art the cry of Marsyas.  It is bitter in\r\nBaudelaire, sweet and plaintive in Lamartine, mystic in Verlaine.  It is\r\nin the deferred resolutions of Chopin\'s music.  It is in the discontent\r\nthat haunts Burne-Jones\'s women.  Even Matthew Arnold, whose song of\r\nCallicles tells of \'the triumph of the sweet persuasive lyre,\' and the\r\n\'famous final victory,\' in such a clear note of lyrical beauty, has not a\r\nlittle of it; in the troubled undertone of doubt and distress that haunts\r\nhis verses, neither Goethe nor Wordsworth could help him, though he\r\nfollowed each in turn, and when he seeks to mourn for _Thyrsis_ or to\r\nsing of the _Scholar Gipsy_, it is the reed that he has to take for the\r\nrendering of his strain.  But whether or not the Phrygian Faun was\r\nsilent, I cannot be.  Expression is as necessary to me as leaf and\r\nblossoms are to the black branches of the trees that show themselves\r\nabove the prison walls and are so restless in the wind.  Between my art\r\nand the world there is now a wide gulf, but between art and myself there\r\nis none.  I hope at least that there is none.\r\n\r\nTo each of us different fates are meted out.  My lot has been one of\r\npublic infamy, of long imprisonment, of misery, of ruin, of disgrace, but\r\nI am not worthy of it--not yet, at any rate.  I remember that I used to\r\nsay that I thought I could bear a real tragedy if it came to me with\r\npurple pall and a mask of noble sorrow, but that the dreadful thing about\r\nmodernity was that it put tragedy into the raiment of comedy, so that the\r\ngreat realities seemed commonplace or grotesque or lacking in style.  It\r\nis quite true about modernity.  It has probably always been true about\r\nactual life.  It is said that all martyrdoms seemed mean to the looker\r\non.  The nineteenth century is no exception to the rule.\r\n\r\nEverything about my tragedy has been hideous, mean, repellent, lacking in\r\nstyle; our very dress makes us grotesque.  We are the zanies of sorrow.\r\nWe are clowns whose hearts are broken.  We are specially designed to\r\nappeal to the sense of humour.  On November 13th, 1895, I was brought\r\ndown here from London.  From two o\'clock till half-past two on that day I\r\nhad to stand on the centre platform of Clapham Junction in convict dress,\r\nand handcuffed, for the world to look at.  I had been taken out of the\r\nhospital ward without a moment\'s notice being given to me.  Of all\r\npossible objects I was the most grotesque.  When people saw me they\r\nlaughed.  Each train as it came up swelled the audience.  Nothing could\r\nexceed their amusement.  That was, of course, before they knew who I was.\r\nAs soon as they had been informed they laughed still more.  For half an\r\nhour I stood there in the grey November rain surrounded by a jeering mob.\r\n\r\nFor a year after that was done to me I wept every day at the same hour\r\nand for the same space of time.  That is not such a tragic thing as\r\npossibly it sounds to you.  To those who are in prison tears are a part\r\nof every day\'s experience.  A day in prison on which one does not weep is\r\na day on which one\'s heart is hard, not a day on which one\'s heart is\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\nWell, now I am really beginning to feel more regret for the people who\r\nlaughed than for myself.  Of course when they saw me I was not on my\r\npedestal, I was in the pillory.  But it is a very unimaginative nature\r\nthat only cares for people on their pedestals.  A pedestal may be a very\r\nunreal thing.  A pillory is a terrific reality.  They should have known\r\nalso how to interpret sorrow better.  I have said that behind sorrow\r\nthere is always sorrow.  It were wiser still to say that behind sorrow\r\nthere is always a soul.  And to mock at a soul in pain is a dreadful\r\nthing.  In the strangely simple economy of the world people only get what\r\nthey give, and to those who have not enough imagination to penetrate the\r\nmere outward of things, and feel pity, what pity can be given save that\r\nof scorn?\r\n\r\nI write this account of the mode of my being transferred here simply that\r\nit should be realised how hard it has been for me to get anything out of\r\nmy punishment but bitterness and despair.  I have, however, to do it, and\r\nnow and then I have moments of submission and acceptance.  All the spring\r\nmay be hidden in the single bud, and the low ground nest of the lark may\r\nhold the joy that is to herald the feet of many rose-red dawns.  So\r\nperhaps whatever beauty of life still remains to me is contained in some\r\nmoment of surrender, abasement, and humiliation.  I can, at any rate,\r\nmerely proceed on the lines of my own development, and, accepting all\r\nthat has happened to me, make myself worthy of it.\r\n\r\nPeople used to say of me that I was too individualistic.  I must be far\r\nmore of an individualist than ever I was.  I must get far more out of\r\nmyself than ever I got, and ask far less of the world than ever I asked.\r\nIndeed, my ruin came not from too great individualism of life, but from\r\ntoo little.  The one disgraceful, unpardonable, and to all time\r\ncontemptible action of my life was to allow myself to appeal to society\r\nfor help and protection.  To have made such an appeal would have been\r\nfrom the individualist point of view bad enough, but what excuse can\r\nthere ever be put forward for having made it?  Of course once I had put\r\ninto motion the forces of society, society turned on me and said, \'Have\r\nyou been living all this time in defiance of my laws, and do you now\r\nappeal to those laws for protection?  You shall have those laws exercised\r\nto the full.  You shall abide by what you have appealed to.\'  The result\r\nis I am in gaol.  Certainly no man ever fell so ignobly, and by such\r\nignoble instruments, as I did.\r\n\r\nThe Philistine element in life is not the failure to understand art.\r\nCharming people, such as fishermen, shepherds, ploughboys, peasants and\r\nthe like, know nothing about art, and are the very salt of the earth.  He\r\nis the Philistine who upholds and aids the heavy, cumbrous, blind,\r\nmechanical forces of society, and who does not recognise dynamic force\r\nwhen he meets it either in a man or a movement.\r\n\r\nPeople thought it dreadful of me to have entertained at dinner the evil\r\nthings of life, and to have found pleasure in their company.  But then,\r\nfrom the point of view through which I, as an artist in life, approach\r\nthem they were delightfully suggestive and stimulating.  The danger was\r\nhalf the excitement. . . . My business as an artist was with Ariel.  I\r\nset myself to wrestle with Caliban. . . .\r\n\r\nA great friend of mine--a friend of ten years\' standing--came to see me\r\nsome time ago, and told me that he did not believe a single word of what\r\nwas said against me, and wished me to know that he considered me quite\r\ninnocent, and the victim of a hideous plot.  I burst into tears at what\r\nhe said, and told him that while there was much amongst the definite\r\ncharges that was quite untrue and transferred to me by revolting malice,\r\nstill that my life had been full of perverse pleasures, and that unless\r\nhe accepted that as a fact about me and realised it to the full I could\r\nnot possibly be friends with him any more, or ever be in his company.  It\r\nwas a terrible shock to him, but we are friends, and I have not got his\r\nfriendship on false pretences.\r\n\r\nEmotional forces, as I say somewhere in _Intentions_, are as limited in\r\nextent and duration as the forces of physical energy.  The little cup\r\nthat is made to hold so much can hold so much and no more, though all the\r\npurple vats of Burgundy be filled with wine to the brim, and the treaders\r\nstand knee-deep in the gathered grapes of the stony vineyards of Spain.\r\nThere is no error more common than that of thinking that those who are\r\nthe causes or occasions of great tragedies share in the feelings suitable\r\nto the tragic mood: no error more fatal than expecting it of them.  The\r\nmartyr in his \'shirt of flame\' may be looking on the face of God, but to\r\nhim who is piling the faggots or loosening the logs for the blast the\r\nwhole scene is no more than the slaying of an ox is to the butcher, or\r\nthe felling of a tree to the charcoal burner in the forest, or the fall\r\nof a flower to one who is mowing down the grass with a scythe.  Great\r\npassions are for the great of soul, and great events can be seen only by\r\nthose who are on a level with them.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nI know of nothing in all drama more incomparable from the point of view\r\nof art, nothing more suggestive in its subtlety of observation, than\r\nShakespeare\'s drawing of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.  They are Hamlet\'s\r\ncollege friends.  They have been his companions.  They bring with them\r\nmemories of pleasant days together.  At the moment when they come across\r\nhim in the play he is staggering under the weight of a burden intolerable\r\nto one of his temperament.  The dead have come armed out of the grave to\r\nimpose on him a mission at once too great and too mean for him.  He is a\r\ndreamer, and he is called upon to act.  He has the nature of the poet,\r\nand he is asked to grapple with the common complexity of cause and\r\neffect, with life in its practical realisation, of which he knows\r\nnothing, not with life in its ideal essence, of which he knows so much.\r\nHe has no conception of what to do, and his folly is to feign folly.\r\nBrutus used madness as a cloak to conceal the sword of his purpose, the\r\ndagger of his will, but the Hamlet madness is a mere mask for the hiding\r\nof weakness.  In the making of fancies and jests he sees a chance of\r\ndelay.  He keeps playing with action as an artist plays with a theory.  He\r\nmakes himself the spy of his proper actions, and listening to his own\r\nwords knows them to be but \'words, words, words.\'  Instead of trying to\r\nbe the hero of his own history, he seeks to be the spectator of his own\r\ntragedy.  He disbelieves in everything, including himself, and yet his\r\ndoubt helps him not, as it comes not from scepticism but from a divided\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nOf all this Guildenstern and Rosencrantz realise nothing.  They bow and\r\nsmirk and smile, and what the one says the other echoes with sickliest\r\nintonation.  When, at last, by means of the play within the play, and the\r\npuppets in their dalliance, Hamlet \'catches the conscience\' of the King,\r\nand drives the wretched man in terror from his throne, Guildenstern and\r\nRosencrantz see no more in his conduct than a rather painful breach of\r\nCourt etiquette.  That is as far as they can attain to in \'the\r\ncontemplation of the spectacle of life with appropriate emotions.\'  They\r\nare close to his very secret and know nothing of it.  Nor would there be\r\nany use in telling them.  They are the little cups that can hold so much\r\nand no more.  Towards the close it is suggested that, caught in a cunning\r\nspring set for another, they have met, or may meet, with a violent and\r\nsudden death.  But a tragic ending of this kind, though touched by\r\nHamlet\'s humour with something of the surprise and justice of comedy, is\r\nreally not for such as they.  They never die.  Horatio, who in order to\r\n\'report Hamlet and his cause aright to the unsatisfied,\'\r\n\r\n   \'Absents him from felicity a while,\r\n   And in this harsh world draws his breath in pain,\'\r\n\r\ndies, but Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are as immortal as Angelo and\r\nTartuffe, and should rank with them.  They are what modern life has\r\ncontributed to the antique ideal of friendship.  He who writes a new _De\r\nAmicitia_ must find a niche for them, and praise them in Tusculan prose.\r\nThey are types fixed for all time.  To censure them would show \'a lack of\r\nappreciation.\'  They are merely out of their sphere: that is all.  In\r\nsublimity of soul there is no contagion.  High thoughts and high emotions\r\nare by their very existence isolated.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nI am to be released, if all goes well with me, towards the end of May,\r\nand hope to go at once to some little sea-side village abroad with R---\r\nand M---.\r\n\r\nThe sea, as Euripides says in one of his plays about Iphigeneia, washes\r\naway the stains and wounds of the world.\r\n\r\nI hope to be at least a month with my friends, and to gain peace and\r\nbalance, and a less troubled heart, and a sweeter mood.  I have a strange\r\nlonging for the great simple primeval things, such as the sea, to me no\r\nless of a mother than the Earth.  It seems to me that we all look at\r\nNature too much, and live with her too little.  I discern great sanity in\r\nthe Greek attitude.  They never chattered about sunsets, or discussed\r\nwhether the shadows on the grass were really mauve or not.  But they saw\r\nthat the sea was for the swimmer, and the sand for the feet of the\r\nrunner.  They loved the trees for the shadow that they cast, and the\r\nforest for its silence at noon.  The vineyard-dresser wreathed his hair\r\nwith ivy that he might keep off the rays of the sun as he stooped over\r\nthe young shoots, and for the artist and the athlete, the two types that\r\nGreece gave us, they plaited with garlands the leaves of the bitter\r\nlaurel and of the wild parsley, which else had been of no service to men.\r\n\r\nWe call ours a utilitarian age, and we do not know the uses of any single\r\nthing.  We have forgotten that water can cleanse, and fire purify, and\r\nthat the Earth is mother to us all.  As a consequence our art is of the\r\nmoon and plays with shadows, while Greek art is of the sun and deals\r\ndirectly with things.  I feel sure that in elemental forces there is\r\npurification, and I want to go back to them and live in their presence.\r\n\r\nOf course to one so modern as I am, \'Enfant de mon siecle,\' merely to\r\nlook at the world will be always lovely.  I tremble with pleasure when I\r\nthink that on the very day of my leaving prison both the laburnum and the\r\nlilac will be blooming in the gardens, and that I shall see the wind stir\r\ninto restless beauty the swaying gold of the one, and make the other toss\r\nthe pale purple of its plumes, so that all the air shall be Arabia for\r\nme.  Linnaeus fell on his knees and wept for joy when he saw for the\r\nfirst time the long heath of some English upland made yellow with the\r\ntawny aromatic brooms of the common furze; and I know that for me, to\r\nwhom flowers are part of desire, there are tears waiting in the petals of\r\nsome rose.  It has always been so with me from my boyhood.  There is not\r\na single colour hidden away in the chalice of a flower, or the curve of a\r\nshell, to which, by some subtle sympathy with the very soul of things, my\r\nnature does not answer.  Like Gautier, I have always been one of those\r\n\'pour qui le monde visible existe.\'\r\n\r\nStill, I am conscious now that behind all this beauty, satisfying though\r\nit may be, there is some spirit hidden of which the painted forms and\r\nshapes are but modes of manifestation, and it is with this spirit that I\r\ndesire to become in harmony.  I have grown tired of the articulate\r\nutterances of men and things.  The Mystical in Art, the Mystical in Life,\r\nthe Mystical in Nature this is what I am looking for.  It is absolutely\r\nnecessary for me to find it somewhere.\r\n\r\nAll trials are trials for one\'s life, just as all sentences are sentences\r\nof death; and three times have I been tried.  The first time I left the\r\nbox to be arrested, the second time to be led back to the house of\r\ndetention, the third time to pass into a prison for two years.  Society,\r\nas we have constituted it, will have no place for me, has none to offer;\r\nbut Nature, whose sweet rains fall on unjust and just alike, will have\r\nclefts in the rocks where I may hide, and secret valleys in whose silence\r\nI may weep undisturbed.  She will hang the night with stars so that I may\r\nwalk abroad in the darkness without stumbling, and send the wind over my\r\nfootprints so that none may track me to my hurt: she will cleanse me in\r\ngreat waters, and with bitter herbs make me whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DE PROFUNDIS***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 921.txt or 921.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/9/2/921\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
