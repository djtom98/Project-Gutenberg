It is\r\ntherefore, to a great extent, contemporaneous with \xe2\x80\x9cLife and Habit,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand may be taken as a practical illustration of the theory of heredity\r\nembodied in that book. He did not work at it after 1884, but for\r\nvarious reasons he postponed its publication. He was occupied in other\r\nways, and he professed himself dissatisfied with it as a whole, and\r\nalways intended to rewrite or at any rate to revise it. His death in\r\n1902 prevented him from doing this, and on his death-bed he gave me\r\nclearly to understand that he wished it to be published in its present\r\nform. I found that the MS. of the fourth and fifth chapters had\r\ndisappeared, but by consulting and comparing various notes and\r\nsketches, which remained among his papers, I have been able to supply\r\nthe missing chapters in a form which I believe does not differ\r\nmaterially from that which he finally adopted. With regard to the\r\nchronology of the events recorded, the reader will do well to bear in\r\nmind that the main body of the novel is supposed to have been written\r\nin the year 1867, and the last chapter added as a postscript in 1882.\r\n\r\nR. A. STREATFEILD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was a small boy at the beginning of the century I remember an\r\nold man who wore knee-breeches and worsted stockings, and who used to\r\nhobble about the street of our village with the help of a stick. He\r\nmust have been getting on for eighty in the year 1807, earlier than\r\nwhich date I suppose I can hardly remember him, for I was born in 1802.\r\nA few white locks hung about his ears, his shoulders were bent and his\r\nknees feeble, but he was still hale, and was much respected in our\r\nlittle world of Paleham. His name was Pontifex.\r\n\r\nHis wife was said to be his master; I have been told she brought him a\r\nlittle money, but it cannot have been much. She was a tall,\r\nsquare-shouldered person (I have heard my father call her a Gothic\r\nwoman) who had insisted on being married to Mr Pontifex when he was\r\nyoung and too good-natured to say nay to any woman who wooed him. The\r\npair had lived not unhappily together, for Mr Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s temper was\r\neasy and he soon learned to bow before his wife\xe2\x80\x99s more stormy moods.\r\n\r\nMr Pontifex was a carpenter by trade; he was also at one time parish\r\nclerk; when I remember him, however, he had so far risen in life as to\r\nbe no longer compelled to work with his own hands. In his earlier days\r\nhe had taught himself to draw. I do not say he drew well, but it was\r\nsurprising he should draw as well as he did. My father, who took the\r\nliving of Paleham about the year 1797, became possessed of a good many\r\nof old Mr Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s drawings, which were always of local subjects, and\r\nso unaffectedly painstaking that they might have passed for the work of\r\nsome good early master. I remember them as hanging up framed and glazed\r\nin the study at the Rectory, and tinted, as all else in the room was\r\ntinted, with the green reflected from the fringe of ivy leaves that\r\ngrew around the windows. I wonder how they will actually cease and come\r\nto an end as drawings, and into what new phases of being they will then\r\nenter.\r\n\r\nNot content with being an artist, Mr Pontifex must needs also be a\r\nmusician. He built the organ in the church with his own hands, and made\r\na smaller one which he kept in his own house. He could play as much as\r\nhe could draw, not very well according to professional standards, but\r\nmuch better than could have been expected. I myself showed a taste for\r\nmusic at an early age, and old Mr Pontifex on finding it out, as he\r\nsoon did, became partial to me in consequence.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought that with so many irons in the fire he could hardly\r\nbe a very thriving man, but this was not the case. His father had been\r\na day labourer, and he had himself begun life with no other capital\r\nthan his good sense and good constitution; now, however, there was a\r\ngoodly show of timber about his yard, and a look of solid comfort over\r\nhis whole establishment. Towards the close of the eighteenth century\r\nand not long before my father came to Paleham, he had taken a farm of\r\nabout ninety acres, thus making a considerable rise in life. Along with\r\nthe farm there went an old-fashioned but comfortable house with a\r\ncharming garden and an orchard. The carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s business was now\r\ncarried on in one of the outhouses that had once been part of some\r\nconventual buildings, the remains of which could be seen in what was\r\ncalled the Abbey Close. The house itself, embosomed in honeysuckles and\r\ncreeping roses, was an ornament to the whole village, nor were its\r\ninternal arrangements less exemplary than its outside was ornamental.\r\nReport said that Mrs Pontifex starched the sheets for her best bed, and\r\nI can well believe it.\r\n\r\nHow well do I remember her parlour half filled with the organ which her\r\nhusband had built, and scented with a withered apple or two from the\r\n_pyrus japonica_ that grew outside the house; the picture of the prize\r\nox over the chimney-piece, which Mr Pontifex himself had painted; the\r\ntransparency of the man coming to show light to a coach upon a snowy\r\nnight, also by Mr Pontifex; the little old man and little old woman who\r\ntold the weather; the china shepherd and shepherdess; the jars of\r\nfeathery flowering grasses with a peacock\xe2\x80\x99s feather or two among them\r\nto set them off, and the china bowls full of dead rose leaves dried\r\nwith bay salt. All has long since vanished and become a memory, faded\r\nbut still fragrant to myself.\r\n\r\nNay, but her kitchen\xe2\x80\x94and the glimpses into a cavernous cellar beyond\r\nit, wherefrom came gleams from the pale surfaces of milk cans, or it\r\nmay be of the arms and face of a milkmaid skimming the cream; or again\r\nher storeroom, where among other treasures she kept the famous lipsalve\r\nwhich was one of her especial glories, and of which she would present a\r\nshape yearly to those whom she delighted to honour. She wrote out the\r\nrecipe for this and gave it to my mother a year or two before she died,\r\nbut we could never make it as she did. When we were children she used\r\nsometimes to send her respects to my mother, and ask leave for us to\r\ncome and take tea with her. Right well she used to ply us. As for her\r\ntemper, we never met such a delightful old lady in our lives; whatever\r\nMr Pontifex may have had to put up with, we had no cause for complaint,\r\nand then Mr Pontifex would play to us upon the organ, and we would\r\nstand round him open-mouthed and think him the most wonderfully clever\r\nman that ever was born, except of course our papa.\r\n\r\nMrs Pontifex had no sense of humour, at least I can call to mind no\r\nsigns of this, but her husband had plenty of fun in him, though few\r\nwould have guessed it from his appearance. I remember my father once\r\nsent me down to his workship to get some glue, and I happened to come\r\nwhen old Pontifex was in the act of scolding his boy. He had got the\r\nlad\xe2\x80\x94a pudding-headed fellow\xe2\x80\x94by the ear and was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Lost\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94smothered o\xe2\x80\x99 wit.\xe2\x80\x9d (I believe it was the boy who was himself\r\nsupposed to be a wandering soul, and who was thus addressed as lost.)\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, look here, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9csome boys are born stupid, and\r\nthou art one of them; some achieve stupidity\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s thee again,\r\nJim\xe2\x80\x94thou wast both born stupid and hast greatly increased thy\r\nbirthright\xe2\x80\x94and some\xe2\x80\x9d (and here came a climax during which the boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead and ear were swayed from side to side) \xe2\x80\x9chave stupidity thrust upon\r\nthem, which, if it please the Lord, shall not be thy case, my lad, for\r\nI will thrust stupidity from thee, though I have to box thine ears in\r\ndoing so,\xe2\x80\x9d but I did not see that the old man really did box Jim\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nears, or do more than pretend to frighten him, for the two understood\r\none another perfectly well. Another time I remember hearing him call\r\nthe village rat-catcher by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cCome hither, thou\r\nthree-days-and-three-nights, thou,\xe2\x80\x9d alluding, as I afterwards learned,\r\nto the rat-catcher\xe2\x80\x99s periods of intoxication; but I will tell no more\r\nof such trifles. My father\xe2\x80\x99s face would always brighten when old\r\nPontifex\xe2\x80\x99s name was mentioned. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, Edward,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say to\r\nme, \xe2\x80\x9cold Pontifex was not only an able man, but he was one of the very\r\nablest men that ever I knew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was more than I as a young man was prepared to stand. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear\r\nfather,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat did he do? He could draw a little, but could\r\nhe to save his life have got a picture into the Royal Academy\r\nexhibition? He built two organs and could play the Minuet in _Samson_\r\non one and the March in _Scipio_ on the other; he was a good carpenter\r\nand a bit of a wag; he was a good old fellow enough, but why make him\r\nout so much abler than he was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy boy,\xe2\x80\x9d returned my father, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must not judge by the work, but by\r\nthe work in connection with the surroundings. Could Giotto or Filippo\r\nLippi, think you, have got a picture into the Exhibition? Would a\r\nsingle one of those frescoes we went to see when we were at Padua have\r\nthe remotest chance of being hung, if it were sent in for exhibition\r\nnow? Why, the Academy people would be so outraged that they would not\r\neven write to poor Giotto to tell him to come and take his fresco away.\r\nPhew!\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, waxing warm, \xe2\x80\x9cif old Pontifex had had Cromwell\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchances he would have done all that Cromwell did, and have done it\r\nbetter; if he had had Giotto\xe2\x80\x99s chances he would have done all that\r\nGiotto did, and done it no worse; as it was, he was a village\r\ncarpenter, and I will undertake to say he never scamped a job in the\r\nwhole course of his life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwe cannot judge people with so many \xe2\x80\x98ifs.\xe2\x80\x99 If old\r\nPontifex had lived in Giotto\xe2\x80\x99s time he might have been another Giotto,\r\nbut he did not live in Giotto\xe2\x80\x99s time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, Edward,\xe2\x80\x9d said my father with some severity, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must judge\r\nmen not so much by what they do, as by what they make us feel that they\r\nhave it in them to do. If a man has done enough either in painting,\r\nmusic or the affairs of life, to make me feel that I might trust him in\r\nan emergency he has done enough. It is not by what a man has actually\r\nput upon his canvas, nor yet by the acts which he has set down, so to\r\nspeak, upon the canvas of his life that I will judge him, but by what\r\nhe makes me feel that he felt and aimed at. If he has made me feel that\r\nhe felt those things to be loveable which I hold loveable myself I ask\r\nno more; his grammar may have been imperfect, but still I have\r\nunderstood him; he and I are _en rapport_; and I say again, Edward,\r\nthat old Pontifex was not only an able man, but one of the very ablest\r\nmen I ever knew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgainst this there was no more to be said, and my sisters eyed me to\r\nsilence. Somehow or other my sisters always did eye me to silence when\r\nI differed from my father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalk of his successful son,\xe2\x80\x9d snorted my father, whom I had fairly\r\nroused. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is not fit to black his father\xe2\x80\x99s boots. He has his\r\nthousands of pounds a year, while his father had perhaps three thousand\r\nshillings a year towards the end of his life. He _is_ a successful man;\r\nbut his father, hobbling about Paleham Street in his grey worsted\r\nstockings, broad brimmed hat and brown swallow-tailed coat was worth a\r\nhundred of George Pontifexes, for all his carriages and horses and the\r\nairs he gives himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge Pontifex is no fool either.\xe2\x80\x9d And this\r\nbrings us to the second generation of the Pontifex family with whom we\r\nneed concern ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Mr Pontifex had married in the year 1750, but for fifteen years his\r\nwife bore no children. At the end of that time Mrs Pontifex astonished\r\nthe whole village by showing unmistakable signs of a disposition to\r\npresent her husband with an heir or heiress. Hers had long ago been\r\nconsidered a hopeless case, and when on consulting the doctor\r\nconcerning the meaning of certain symptoms she was informed of their\r\nsignificance, she became very angry and abused the doctor roundly for\r\ntalking nonsense. She refused to put so much as a piece of thread into\r\na needle in anticipation of her confinement and would have been\r\nabsolutely unprepared, if her neighbours had not been better judges of\r\nher condition than she was, and got things ready without telling her\r\nanything about it. Perhaps she feared Nemesis, though assuredly she\r\nknew not who or what Nemesis was; perhaps she feared the doctor had\r\nmade a mistake and she should be laughed at; from whatever cause,\r\nhowever, her refusal to recognise the obvious arose, she certainly\r\nrefused to recognise it, until one snowy night in January the doctor\r\nwas sent for with all urgent speed across the rough country roads. When\r\nhe arrived he found two patients, not one, in need of his assistance,\r\nfor a boy had been born who was in due time christened George, in\r\nhonour of his then reigning majesty.\r\n\r\nTo the best of my belief George Pontifex got the greater part of his\r\nnature from this obstinate old lady, his mother\xe2\x80\x94a mother who though she\r\nloved no one else in the world except her husband (and him only after a\r\nfashion) was most tenderly attached to the unexpected child of her old\r\nage; nevertheless she showed it little.\r\n\r\nThe boy grew up into a sturdy bright-eyed little fellow, with plenty of\r\nintelligence, and perhaps a trifle too great readiness at book\r\nlearning. Being kindly treated at home, he was as fond of his father\r\nand mother as it was in his nature to be of anyone, but he was fond of\r\nno one else. He had a good healthy sense of _meum_, and as little of\r\n_tuum_ as he could help. Brought up much in the open air in one of the\r\nbest situated and healthiest villages in England, his little limbs had\r\nfair play, and in those days children\xe2\x80\x99s brains were not overtasked as\r\nthey now are; perhaps it was for this very reason that the boy showed\r\nan avidity to learn. At seven or eight years old he could read, write\r\nand sum better than any other boy of his age in the village. My father\r\nwas not yet rector of Paleham, and did not remember George Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchildhood, but I have heard neighbours tell him that the boy was looked\r\nupon as unusually quick and forward. His father and mother were\r\nnaturally proud of their offspring, and his mother was determined that\r\nhe should one day become one of the kings and councillors of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt is one thing however to resolve that one\xe2\x80\x99s son shall win some of\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x99s larger prizes, and another to square matters with fortune in\r\nthis respect. George Pontifex might have been brought up as a carpenter\r\nand succeeded in no other way than as succeeding his father as one of\r\nthe minor magnates of Paleham, and yet have been a more truly\r\nsuccessful man than he actually was\xe2\x80\x94for I take it there is not much\r\nmore solid success in this world than what fell to the lot of old Mr\r\nand Mrs Pontifex; it happened, however, that about the year 1780, when\r\nGeorge was a boy of fifteen, a sister of Mrs Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s, who had\r\nmarried a Mr Fairlie, came to pay a few days\xe2\x80\x99 visit at Paleham. Mr\r\nFairlie was a publisher, chiefly of religious works, and had an\r\nestablishment in Paternoster Row; he had risen in life, and his wife\r\nhad risen with him. No very close relations had been maintained between\r\nthe sisters for some years, and I forget exactly how it came about that\r\nMr and Mrs Fairlie were guests in the quiet but exceedingly comfortable\r\nhouse of their sister and brother-in-law; but for some reason or other\r\nthe visit was paid, and little George soon succeeded in making his way\r\ninto his uncle and aunt\xe2\x80\x99s good graces. A quick, intelligent boy with a\r\ngood address, a sound constitution, and coming of respectable parents,\r\nhas a potential value which a practised business man who has need of\r\nmany subordinates is little likely to overlook. Before his visit was\r\nover Mr Fairlie proposed to the lad\xe2\x80\x99s father and mother that he should\r\nput him into his own business, at the same time promising that if the\r\nboy did well he should not want some one to bring him forward. Mrs\r\nPontifex had her son\xe2\x80\x99s interest too much at heart to refuse such an\r\noffer, so the matter was soon arranged, and about a fortnight after the\r\nFairlies had left, George was sent up by coach to London, where he was\r\nmet by his uncle and aunt, with whom it was arranged that he should\r\nlive.\r\n\r\nThis was George\xe2\x80\x99s great start in life. He now wore more fashionable\r\nclothes than he had yet been accustomed to, and any little rusticity of\r\ngait or pronunciation which he had brought from Paleham, was so quickly\r\nand completely lost that it was ere long impossible to detect that he\r\nhad not been born and bred among people of what is commonly called\r\neducation. The boy paid great attention to his work, and more than\r\njustified the favourable opinion which Mr Fairlie had formed concerning\r\nhim. Sometimes Mr Fairlie would send him down to Paleham for a few\r\ndays\xe2\x80\x99 holiday, and ere long his parents perceived that he had acquired\r\nan air and manner of talking different from any that he had taken with\r\nhim from Paleham. They were proud of him, and soon fell into their\r\nproper places, resigning all appearance of a parental control, for\r\nwhich indeed there was no kind of necessity. In return, George was\r\nalways kindly to them, and to the end of his life retained a more\r\naffectionate feeling towards his father and mother than I imagine him\r\never to have felt again for man, woman, or child.\r\n\r\nGeorge\xe2\x80\x99s visits to Paleham were never long, for the distance from\r\nLondon was under fifty miles and there was a direct coach, so that the\r\njourney was easy; there was not time, therefore, for the novelty to\r\nwear off either on the part of the young man or of his parents. George\r\nliked the fresh country air and green fields after the darkness to\r\nwhich he had been so long accustomed in Paternoster Row, which then, as\r\nnow, was a narrow gloomy lane rather than a street. Independently of\r\nthe pleasure of seeing the familiar faces of the farmers and villagers,\r\nhe liked also being seen and being congratulated on growing up such a\r\nfine-looking and fortunate young fellow, for he was not the youth to\r\nhide his light under a bushel. His uncle had had him taught Latin and\r\nGreek of an evening; he had taken kindly to these languages and had\r\nrapidly and easily mastered what many boys take years in acquiring. I\r\nsuppose his knowledge gave him a self-confidence which made itself felt\r\nwhether he intended it or not; at any rate, he soon began to pose as a\r\njudge of literature, and from this to being a judge of art,\r\narchitecture, music and everything else, the path was easy. Like his\r\nfather, he knew the value of money, but he was at once more\r\nostentatious and less liberal than his father; while yet a boy he was a\r\nthorough little man of the world, and did well rather upon principles\r\nwhich he had tested by personal experiment, and recognised as\r\nprinciples, than from those profounder convictions which in his father\r\nwere so instinctive that he could give no account concerning them.\r\n\r\nHis father, as I have said, wondered at him and let him alone. His son\r\nhad fairly distanced him, and in an inarticulate way the father knew it\r\nperfectly well. After a few years he took to wearing his best clothes\r\nwhenever his son came to stay with him, nor would he discard them for\r\nhis ordinary ones till the young man had returned to London. I believe\r\nold Mr Pontifex, along with his pride and affection, felt also a\r\ncertain fear of his son, as though of something which he could not\r\nthoroughly understand, and whose ways, notwithstanding outward\r\nagreement, were nevertheless not as his ways. Mrs Pontifex felt nothing\r\nof this; to her George was pure and absolute perfection, and she saw,\r\nor thought she saw, with pleasure, that he resembled her and her family\r\nin feature as well as in disposition rather than her husband and his.\r\n\r\nWhen George was about twenty-five years old his uncle took him into\r\npartnership on very liberal terms. He had little cause to regret this\r\nstep. The young man infused fresh vigour into a concern that was\r\nalready vigorous, and by the time he was thirty found himself in the\r\nreceipt of not less than \xc2\xa31500 a year as his share of the profits. Two\r\nyears later he married a lady about seven years younger than himself,\r\nwho brought him a handsome dowry. She died in 1805, when her youngest\r\nchild Alethea was born, and her husband did not marry again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early years of the century five little children and a couple of\r\nnurses began to make periodical visits to Paleham. It is needless to\r\nsay they were a rising generation of Pontifexes, towards whom the old\r\ncouple, their grandparents, were as tenderly deferential as they would\r\nhave been to the children of the Lord Lieutenant of the County. Their\r\nnames were Eliza, Maria, John, Theobald (who like myself was born in\r\n1802), and Alethea. Mr Pontifex always put the prefix \xe2\x80\x9cmaster\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmiss\xe2\x80\x9d before the names of his grandchildren, except in the case of\r\nAlethea, who was his favourite. To have resisted his grandchildren\r\nwould have been as impossible for him as to have resisted his wife;\r\neven old Mrs Pontifex yielded before her son\xe2\x80\x99s children, and gave them\r\nall manner of licence which she would never have allowed even to my\r\nsisters and myself, who stood next in her regard. Two regulations only\r\nthey must attend to; they must wipe their shoes well on coming into the\r\nhouse, and they must not overfeed Mr Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s organ with wind, nor\r\ntake the pipes out.\r\n\r\nBy us at the Rectory there was no time so much looked forward to as the\r\nannual visit of the little Pontifexes to Paleham. We came in for some\r\nof the prevailing licence; we went to tea with Mrs Pontifex to meet her\r\ngrandchildren, and then our young friends were asked to the Rectory to\r\nhave tea with us, and we had what we considered great times. I fell\r\ndesperately in love with Alethea, indeed we all fell in love with each\r\nother, plurality and exchange whether of wives or husbands being openly\r\nand unblushingly advocated in the very presence of our nurses. We were\r\nvery merry, but it is so long ago that I have forgotten nearly\r\neverything save that we _were_ very merry. Almost the only thing that\r\nremains with me as a permanent impression was the fact that Theobald\r\none day beat his nurse and teased her, and when she said she should go\r\naway cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cYou shan\xe2\x80\x99t go away\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you on purpose to torment\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne winter\xe2\x80\x99s morning, however, in the year 1811, we heard the church\r\nbell tolling while we were dressing in the back nursery and were told\r\nit was for old Mrs Pontifex. Our man-servant John told us and added\r\nwith grim levity that they were ringing the bell to come and take her\r\naway. She had had a fit of paralysis which had carried her off quite\r\nsuddenly. It was very shocking, the more so because our nurse assured\r\nus that if God chose we might all have fits of paralysis ourselves that\r\nvery day and be taken straight off to the Day of Judgement. The Day of\r\nJudgement indeed, according to the opinion of those who were most\r\nlikely to know, would not under any circumstances be delayed more than\r\na few years longer, and then the whole world would be burned, and we\r\nourselves be consigned to an eternity of torture, unless we mended our\r\nways more than we at present seemed at all likely to do. All this was\r\nso alarming that we fell to screaming and made such a hullabaloo that\r\nthe nurse was obliged for her own peace to reassure us. Then we wept,\r\nbut more composedly, as we remembered that there would be no more tea\r\nand cakes for us now at old Mrs Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the funeral, however, we had a great excitement; old Mr\r\nPontifex sent round a penny loaf to every inhabitant of the village\r\naccording to a custom still not uncommon at the beginning of the\r\ncentury; the loaf was called a dole. We had never heard of this custom\r\nbefore, besides, though we had often heard of penny loaves, we had\r\nnever before seen one; moreover, they were presents to us as\r\ninhabitants of the village, and we were treated as grown up people, for\r\nour father and mother and the servants had each one loaf sent them, but\r\nonly one. We had never yet suspected that we were inhabitants at all;\r\nfinally, the little loaves were new, and we were passionately fond of\r\nnew bread, which we were seldom or never allowed to have, as it was\r\nsupposed not to be good for us. Our affection, therefore, for our old\r\nfriend had to stand against the combined attacks of arch\xc3\xa6ological\r\ninterest, the rights of citizenship and property, the pleasantness to\r\nthe eye and goodness for food of the little loaves themselves, and the\r\nsense of importance which was given us by our having been intimate with\r\nsomeone who had actually died. It seemed upon further inquiry that\r\nthere was little reason to anticipate an early death for anyone of\r\nourselves, and this being so, we rather liked the idea of someone\r\nelse\xe2\x80\x99s being put away into the churchyard; we passed, therefore, in a\r\nshort time from extreme depression to a no less extreme exultation; a\r\nnew heaven and a new earth had been revealed to us in our perception of\r\nthe possibility of benefiting by the death of our friends, and I fear\r\nthat for some time we took an interest in the health of everyone in the\r\nvillage whose position rendered a repetition of the dole in the least\r\nlikely.\r\n\r\nThose were the days in which all great things seemed far off, and we\r\nwere astonished to find that Napoleon Buonaparte was an actually living\r\nperson. We had thought such a great man could only have lived a very\r\nlong time ago, and here he was after all almost as it were at our own\r\ndoors. This lent colour to the view that the Day of Judgement might\r\nindeed be nearer than we had thought, but nurse said that was all right\r\nnow, and she knew. In those days the snow lay longer and drifted deeper\r\nin the lanes than it does now, and the milk was sometimes brought in\r\nfrozen in winter, and we were taken down into the back kitchen to see\r\nit. I suppose there are rectories up and down the country now where the\r\nmilk comes in frozen sometimes in winter, and the children go down to\r\nwonder at it, but I never see any frozen milk in London, so I suppose\r\nthe winters are warmer than they used to be.\r\n\r\nAbout one year after his wife\xe2\x80\x99s death Mr Pontifex also was gathered to\r\nhis fathers. My father saw him the day before he died. The old man had\r\na theory about sunsets, and had had two steps built up against a wall\r\nin the kitchen garden on which he used to stand and watch the sun go\r\ndown whenever it was clear. My father came on him in the afternoon,\r\njust as the sun was setting, and saw him with his arms resting on the\r\ntop of the wall looking towards the sun over a field through which\r\nthere was a path on which my father was. My father heard him say\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, sun; good-bye, sun,\xe2\x80\x9d as the sun sank, and saw by his tone\r\nand manner that he was feeling very feeble. Before the next sunset he\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nThere was no dole. Some of his grandchildren were brought to the\r\nfuneral and we remonstrated with them, but did not take much by doing\r\nso. John Pontifex, who was a year older than I was, sneered at penny\r\nloaves, and intimated that if I wanted one it must be because my papa\r\nand mamma could not afford to buy me one, whereon I believe we did\r\nsomething like fighting, and I rather think John Pontifex got the worst\r\nof it, but it may have been the other way. I remember my sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnurse, for I was just outgrowing nurses myself, reported the matter to\r\nhigher quarters, and we were all of us put to some ignominy, but we had\r\nbeen thoroughly awakened from our dream, and it was long enough before\r\nwe could hear the words \xe2\x80\x9cpenny loaf\xe2\x80\x9d mentioned without our ears\r\ntingling with shame. If there had been a dozen doles afterwards we\r\nshould not have deigned to touch one of them.\r\n\r\nGeorge Pontifex put up a monument to his parents, a plain slab in\r\nPaleham church, inscribed with the following epitaph:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nSACRED TO THE MEMORY\r\nOF\r\nJOHN PONTIFEX\r\nWHO WAS BORN AUGUST 16TH,\r\n1727, AND DIED FEBRUARY 8, 1812,\r\nIN HIS 85TH YEAR,\r\nAND OF\r\nRUTH PONTIFEX, HIS WIFE,\r\nWHO WAS BORN OCTOBER 13, 1727, AND DIED JANUARY 10, 1811,\r\nIN HER 84TH YEAR.\r\nTHEY WERE UNOSTENTATIOUS BUT EXEMPLARY\r\nIN THE DISCHARGE OF THEIR\r\nRELIGIOUS, MORAL, AND SOCIAL DUTIES.\r\nTHIS MONUMENT WAS PLACED\r\nBY THEIR ONLY SON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a year or two more came Waterloo and the European peace. Then Mr\r\nGeorge Pontifex went abroad more than once. I remember seeing at\r\nBattersby in after years the diary which he kept on the first of these\r\noccasions. It is a characteristic document. I felt as I read it that\r\nthe author before starting had made up his mind to admire only what he\r\nthought it would be creditable in him to admire, to look at nature and\r\nart only through the spectacles that had been handed down to him by\r\ngeneration after generation of prigs and impostors. The first glimpse\r\nof Mont Blanc threw Mr Pontifex into a conventional ecstasy. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nfeelings I cannot express. I gasped, yet hardly dared to breathe, as I\r\nviewed for the first time the monarch of the mountains. I seemed to\r\nfancy the genius seated on his stupendous throne far above his aspiring\r\nbrethren and in his solitary might defying the universe. I was so\r\novercome by my feelings that I was almost bereft of my faculties, and\r\nwould not for worlds have spoken after my first exclamation till I\r\nfound some relief in a gush of tears. With pain I tore myself from\r\ncontemplating for the first time \xe2\x80\x98at distance dimly seen\xe2\x80\x99 (though I\r\nfelt as if I had sent my soul and eyes after it), this sublime\r\nspectacle.\xe2\x80\x9d After a nearer view of the Alps from above Geneva he walked\r\nnine out of the twelve miles of the descent: \xe2\x80\x9cMy mind and heart were\r\ntoo full to sit still, and I found some relief by exhausting my\r\nfeelings through exercise.\xe2\x80\x9d In the course of time he reached Chamonix\r\nand went on a Sunday to the Montanvert to see the Mer de Glace. There\r\nhe wrote the following verses for the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 book, which he\r\nconsidered, so he says, \xe2\x80\x9csuitable to the day and scene\xe2\x80\x9d:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nLord, while these wonders of thy hand I see,\r\nMy soul in holy reverence bends to thee.\r\nThese awful solitudes, this dread repose,\r\nYon pyramid sublime of spotless snows,\r\nThese spiry pinnacles, those smiling plains,\r\nThis sea where one eternal winter reigns,\r\nThese are thy works, and while on them I gaze\r\nI hear a silent tongue that speaks thy praise.\r\n\r\nSome poets always begin to get groggy about the knees after running for\r\nseven or eight lines. Mr Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s last couplet gave him a lot of\r\ntrouble, and nearly every word has been erased and rewritten once at\r\nleast. In the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 book at the Montanvert, however, he must have\r\nbeen obliged to commit himself definitely to one reading or another.\r\nTaking the verses all round, I should say that Mr Pontifex was right in\r\nconsidering them suitable to the day; I don\xe2\x80\x99t like being too hard even\r\non the Mer de Glace, so will give no opinion as to whether they are\r\nsuitable to the scene also.\r\n\r\nMr Pontifex went on to the Great St Bernard and there he wrote some\r\nmore verses, this time I am afraid in Latin. He also took good care to\r\nbe properly impressed by the Hospice and its situation. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole of\r\nthis most extraordinary journey seemed like a dream, its conclusion\r\nespecially, in gentlemanly society, with every comfort and\r\naccommodation amidst the rudest rocks and in the region of perpetual\r\nsnow. The thought that I was sleeping in a convent and occupied the bed\r\nof no less a person than Napoleon, that I was in the highest inhabited\r\nspot in the old world and in a place celebrated in every part of it,\r\nkept me awake some time.\xe2\x80\x9d As a contrast to this, I may quote here an\r\nextract from a letter written to me last year by his grandson Ernest,\r\nof whom the reader will hear more presently. The passage runs: \xe2\x80\x9cI went\r\nup to the Great St Bernard and saw the dogs.\xe2\x80\x9d In due course Mr Pontifex\r\nfound his way into Italy, where the pictures and other works of\r\nart\xe2\x80\x94those, at least, which were fashionable at that time\xe2\x80\x94threw him into\r\ngenteel paroxysms of admiration. Of the Uffizi Gallery at Florence he\r\nwrites: \xe2\x80\x9cI have spent three hours this morning in the gallery and I\r\nhave made up my mind that if of all the treasures I have seen in Italy\r\nI were to choose one room it would be the Tribune of this gallery. It\r\ncontains the Venus de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici, the Explorator, the Pancratist, the\r\nDancing Faun and a fine Apollo. These more than outweigh the Laocoon\r\nand the Belvedere Apollo at Rome. It contains, besides, the St John of\r\nRaphael and many other _chefs-d\xe2\x80\x99\xc5\x93uvre_ of the greatest masters in the\r\nworld.\xe2\x80\x9d It is interesting to compare Mr Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s effusions with the\r\nrhapsodies of critics in our own times. Not long ago a much esteemed\r\nwriter informed the world that he felt \xe2\x80\x9cdisposed to cry out with\r\ndelight\xe2\x80\x9d before a figure by Michael Angelo. I wonder whether he would\r\nfeel disposed to cry out before a real Michael Angelo, if the critics\r\nhad decided that it was not genuine, or before a reputed Michael Angelo\r\nwhich was really by someone else. But I suppose that a prig with more\r\nmoney than brains was much the same sixty or seventy years ago as he is\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nLook at Mendelssohn again about this same Tribune on which Mr Pontifex\r\nfelt so safe in staking his reputation as a man of taste and culture.\r\nHe feels no less safe and writes, \xe2\x80\x9cI then went to the Tribune. This\r\nroom is so delightfully small you can traverse it in fifteen paces, yet\r\nit contains a world of art. I again sought out my favourite arm chair\r\nwhich stands under the statue of the \xe2\x80\x98Slave whetting his knife\xe2\x80\x99\r\n(L\xe2\x80\x99Arrotino), and taking possession of it I enjoyed myself for a couple\r\nof hours; for here at one glance I had the \xe2\x80\x98Madonna del Cardellino,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nPope Julius II., a female portrait by Raphael, and above it a lovely\r\nHoly Family by Perugino; and so close to me that I could have touched\r\nit with my hand the Venus de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici; beyond, that of Titian . . . The\r\nspace between is occupied by other pictures of Raphael\xe2\x80\x99s, a portrait by\r\nTitian, a Domenichino, etc., etc., all these within the circumference\r\nof a small semi-circle no larger than one of your own rooms. This is a\r\nspot where a man feels his own insignificance and may well learn to be\r\nhumble.\xe2\x80\x9d The Tribune is a slippery place for people like Mendelssohn to\r\nstudy humility in. They generally take two steps away from it for one\r\nthey take towards it. I wonder how many chalks Mendelssohn gave himself\r\nfor having sat two hours on that chair. I wonder how often he looked at\r\nhis watch to see if his two hours were up. I wonder how often he told\r\nhimself that he was quite as big a gun, if the truth were known, as any\r\nof the men whose works he saw before him, how often he wondered whether\r\nany of the visitors were recognizing him and admiring him for sitting\r\nsuch a long time in the same chair, and how often he was vexed at\r\nseeing them pass him by and take no notice of him. But perhaps if the\r\ntruth were known his two hours was not quite two hours.\r\n\r\nReturning to Mr Pontifex, whether he liked what he believed to be the\r\nmasterpieces of Greek and Italian art or no he brought back some copies\r\nby Italian artists, which I have no doubt he satisfied himself would\r\nbear the strictest examination with the originals. Two of these copies\r\nfell to Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s share on the division of his father\xe2\x80\x99s furniture, and\r\nI have often seen them at Battersby on my visits to Theobald and his\r\nwife. The one was a Madonna by Sassoferrato with a blue hood over her\r\nhead which threw it half into shadow. The other was a Magdalen by Carlo\r\nDolci with a very fine head of hair and a marble vase in her hands.\r\nWhen I was a young man I used to think these pictures were beautiful,\r\nbut with each successive visit to Battersby I got to dislike them more\r\nand more and to see \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge Pontifex\xe2\x80\x9d written all over both of them. In\r\nthe end I ventured after a tentative fashion to blow on them a little,\r\nbut Theobald and his wife were up in arms at once. They did not like\r\ntheir father and father-in-law, but there could be no question about\r\nhis power and general ability, nor about his having been a man of\r\nconsummate taste both in literature and art\xe2\x80\x94indeed the diary he kept\r\nduring his foreign tour was enough to prove this. With one more short\r\nextract I will leave this diary and proceed with my story. During his\r\nstay in Florence Mr Pontifex wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cI have just seen the Grand Duke\r\nand his family pass by in two carriages and six, but little more notice\r\nis taken of them than if I, who am utterly unknown here, were to pass\r\nby.\xe2\x80\x9d I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that he half believed in his being utterly unknown\r\nin Florence or anywhere else!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nFortune, we are told, is a blind and fickle foster-mother, who showers\r\nher gifts at random upon her nurslings. But we do her a grave injustice\r\nif we believe such an accusation. Trace a man\xe2\x80\x99s career from his cradle\r\nto his grave and mark how Fortune has treated him. You will find that\r\nwhen he is once dead she can for the most part be vindicated from the\r\ncharge of any but very superficial fickleness. Her blindness is the\r\nmerest fable; she can espy her favourites long before they are born. We\r\nare as days and have had our parents for our yesterdays, but through\r\nall the fair weather of a clear parental sky the eye of Fortune can\r\ndiscern the coming storm, and she laughs as she places her favourites\r\nit may be in a London alley or those whom she is resolved to ruin in\r\nkings\xe2\x80\x99 palaces. Seldom does she relent towards those whom she has\r\nsuckled unkindly and seldom does she completely fail a favoured\r\nnursling.\r\n\r\nWas George Pontifex one of Fortune\xe2\x80\x99s favoured nurslings or not? On the\r\nwhole I should say that he was not, for he did not consider himself so;\r\nhe was too religious to consider Fortune a deity at all; he took\r\nwhatever she gave and never thanked her, being firmly convinced that\r\nwhatever he got to his own advantage was of his own getting. And so it\r\nwas, after Fortune had made him able to get it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNos te, nos facimus, Fortuna, deam,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the poet. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is we who\r\nmake thee, Fortune, a goddess\xe2\x80\x9d; and so it is, after Fortune has made us\r\nable to make her. The poet says nothing as to the making of the \xe2\x80\x9cnos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nPerhaps some men are independent of antecedents and surroundings and\r\nhave an initial force within themselves which is in no way due to\r\ncausation; but this is supposed to be a difficult question and it may\r\nbe as well to avoid it. Let it suffice that George Pontifex did not\r\nconsider himself fortunate, and he who does not consider himself\r\nfortunate is unfortunate.\r\n\r\nTrue, he was rich, universally respected and of an excellent natural\r\nconstitution. If he had eaten and drunk less he would never have known\r\na day\xe2\x80\x99s indisposition. Perhaps his main strength lay in the fact that\r\nthough his capacity was a little above the average, it was not too much\r\nso. It is on this rock that so many clever people split. The successful\r\nman will see just so much more than his neighbours as they will be able\r\nto see too when it is shown them, but not enough to puzzle them. It is\r\nfar safer to know too little than too much. People will condemn the\r\none, though they will resent being called upon to exert themselves to\r\nfollow the other.\r\n\r\nThe best example of Mr Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s good sense in matters connected with\r\nhis business which I can think of at this moment is the revolution\r\nwhich he effected in the style of advertising works published by the\r\nfirm. When he first became a partner one of the firm\xe2\x80\x99s advertisements\r\nran thus:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBooks proper to be given away at this Season.\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Pious Country Parishioner, being directions how a Christian may\r\nmanage every day in the course of his whole life with safety and\r\nsuccess; how to spend the Sabbath Day; what books of the Holy Scripture\r\nought to be read first; the whole method of education; collects for the\r\nmost important virtues that adorn the soul; a discourse on the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nSupper; rules to set the soul right in sickness; so that in this\r\ntreatise are contained all the rules requisite for salvation. The 8th\r\nedition with additions. Price 10d.\r\n\r\n*** An allowance will be made to those who give them away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore he had been many years a partner the advertisement stood as\r\nfollows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Pious Country Parishioner. A complete manual of Christian\r\nDevotion. Price 10d.\r\n\r\nA reduction will be made to purchasers for gratuitous distribution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat a stride is made in the foregoing towards the modern standard, and\r\nwhat intelligence is involved in the perception of the unseemliness of\r\nthe old style, when others did not perceive it!\r\n\r\nWhere then was the weak place in George Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s armour? I suppose in\r\nthe fact that he had risen too rapidly. It would almost seem as if a\r\ntransmitted education of some generations is necessary for the due\r\nenjoyment of great wealth. Adversity, if a man is set down to it by\r\ndegrees, is more supportable with equanimity by most people than any\r\ngreat prosperity arrived at in a single lifetime. Nevertheless a\r\ncertain kind of good fortune generally attends self-made men to the\r\nlast. It is their children of the first, or first and second,\r\ngeneration who are in greater danger, for the race can no more repeat\r\nits most successful performances suddenly and without its ebbings and\r\nflowings of success than the individual can do so, and the more\r\nbrilliant the success in any one generation, the greater as a general\r\nrule the subsequent exhaustion until time has been allowed for\r\nrecovery. Hence it oftens happens that the grandson of a successful man\r\nwill be more successful than the son\xe2\x80\x94the spirit that actuated the\r\ngrandfather having lain fallow in the son and being refreshed by repose\r\nso as to be ready for fresh exertion in the grandson. A very successful\r\nman, moreover, has something of the hybrid in him; he is a new animal,\r\narising from the coming together of many unfamiliar elements and it is\r\nwell known that the reproduction of abnormal growths, whether animal or\r\nvegetable, is irregular and not to be depended upon, even when they are\r\nnot absolutely sterile.\r\n\r\nAnd certainly Mr Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s success was exceedingly rapid. Only a few\r\nyears after he had become a partner his uncle and aunt both died within\r\na few months of one another. It was then found that they had made him\r\ntheir heir. He was thus not only sole partner in the business but found\r\nhimself with a fortune of some \xc2\xa330,000 into the bargain, and this was a\r\nlarge sum in those days. Money came pouring in upon him, and the faster\r\nit came the fonder he became of it, though, as he frequently said, he\r\nvalued it not for its own sake, but only as a means of providing for\r\nhis dear children.\r\n\r\nYet when a man is very fond of his money it is not easy for him at all\r\ntimes to be very fond of his children also. The two are like God and\r\nMammon. Lord Macaulay has a passage in which he contrasts the pleasures\r\nwhich a man may derive from books with the inconveniences to which he\r\nmay be put by his acquaintances. \xe2\x80\x9cPlato,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cis never sullen.\r\nCervantes is never petulant. Demosthenes never comes unseasonably.\r\nDante never stays too long. No difference of political opinion can\r\nalienate Cicero. No heresy can excite the horror of Bossuet.\xe2\x80\x9d I dare\r\nsay I might differ from Lord Macaulay in my estimate of some of the\r\nwriters he has named, but there can be no disputing his main\r\nproposition, namely, that we need have no more trouble from any of them\r\nthan we have a mind to, whereas our friends are not always so easily\r\ndisposed of. George Pontifex felt this as regards his children and his\r\nmoney. His money was never naughty; his money never made noise or\r\nlitter, and did not spill things on the tablecloth at meal times, or\r\nleave the door open when it went out. His dividends did not quarrel\r\namong themselves, nor was he under any uneasiness lest his mortgages\r\nshould become extravagant on reaching manhood and run him up debts\r\nwhich sooner or later he should have to pay. There were tendencies in\r\nJohn which made him very uneasy, and Theobald, his second son, was idle\r\nand at times far from truthful. His children might, perhaps, have\r\nanswered, had they known what was in their father\xe2\x80\x99s mind, that he did\r\nnot knock his money about as he not infrequently knocked his children.\r\nHe never dealt hastily or pettishly with his money, and that was\r\nperhaps why he and it got on so well together.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that at the beginning of the nineteenth century\r\nthe relations between parents and children were still far from\r\nsatisfactory. The violent type of father, as described by Fielding,\r\nRichardson, Smollett and Sheridan, is now hardly more likely to find a\r\nplace in literature than the original advertisement of Messrs. Fairlie\r\n& Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPious Country Parishioner,\xe2\x80\x9d but the type was much too\r\npersistent not to have been drawn from nature closely. The parents in\r\nMiss Austen\xe2\x80\x99s novels are less like savage wild beasts than those of her\r\npredecessors, but she evidently looks upon them with suspicion, and an\r\nuneasy feeling that _le p\xc3\xa8re de famille est capable de tout_ makes\r\nitself sufficiently apparent throughout the greater part of her\r\nwritings. In the Elizabethan time the relations between parents and\r\nchildren seem on the whole to have been more kindly. The fathers and\r\nthe sons are for the most part friends in Shakespeare, nor does the\r\nevil appear to have reached its full abomination till a long course of\r\nPuritanism had familiarised men\xe2\x80\x99s minds with Jewish ideals as those\r\nwhich we should endeavour to reproduce in our everyday life. What\r\nprecedents did not Abraham, Jephthah and Jonadab the son of Rechab\r\noffer? How easy was it to quote and follow them in an age when few\r\nreasonable men or women doubted that every syllable of the Old\r\nTestament was taken down _verbatim_ from the mouth of God. Moreover,\r\nPuritanism restricted natural pleasures; it substituted the Jeremiad\r\nfor the P\xc3\xa6an, and it forgot that the poor abuses of all times want\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\nMr Pontifex may have been a little sterner with his children than some\r\nof his neighbours, but not much. He thrashed his boys two or three\r\ntimes a week and some weeks a good deal oftener, but in those days\r\nfathers were always thrashing their boys. It is easy to have juster\r\nviews when everyone else has them, but fortunately or unfortunately\r\nresults have nothing whatever to do with the moral guilt or\r\nblamelessness of him who brings them about; they depend solely upon the\r\nthing done, whatever it may happen to be. The moral guilt or\r\nblamelessness in like manner has nothing to do with the result; it\r\nturns upon the question whether a sufficient number of reasonable\r\npeople placed as the actor was placed would have done as the actor has\r\ndone. At that time it was universally admitted that to spare the rod\r\nwas to spoil the child, and St Paul had placed disobedience to parents\r\nin very ugly company. If his children did anything which Mr Pontifex\r\ndisliked they were clearly disobedient to their father. In this case\r\nthere was obviously only one course for a sensible man to take. It\r\nconsisted in checking the first signs of self-will while his children\r\nwere too young to offer serious resistance. If their wills were \xe2\x80\x9cwell\r\nbroken\xe2\x80\x9d in childhood, to use an expression then much in vogue, they\r\nwould acquire habits of obedience which they would not venture to break\r\nthrough till they were over twenty-one years old. Then they might\r\nplease themselves; he should know how to protect himself; till then he\r\nand his money were more at their mercy than he liked.\r\n\r\nHow little do we know our thoughts\xe2\x80\x94our reflex actions indeed, yes; but\r\nour reflex reflections! Man, forsooth, prides himself on his\r\nconsciousness! We boast that we differ from the winds and waves and\r\nfalling stones and plants, which grow they know not why, and from the\r\nwandering creatures which go up and down after their prey, as we are\r\npleased to say without the help of reason. We know so well what we are\r\ndoing ourselves and why we do it, do we not? I fancy that there is some\r\ntruth in the view which is being put forward nowadays, that it is our\r\nless conscious thoughts and our less conscious actions which mainly\r\nmould our lives and the lives of those who spring from us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Pontifex was not the man to trouble himself much about his motives.\r\nPeople were not so introspective then as we are now; they lived more\r\naccording to a rule of thumb. Dr Arnold had not yet sown that crop of\r\nearnest thinkers which we are now harvesting, and men did not see why\r\nthey should not have their own way if no evil consequences to\r\nthemselves seemed likely to follow upon their doing so. Then as now,\r\nhowever, they sometimes let themselves in for more evil consequences\r\nthan they had bargained for.\r\n\r\nLike other rich men at the beginning of this century he ate and drank a\r\ngood deal more than was enough to keep him in health. Even his\r\nexcellent constitution was not proof against a prolonged course of\r\noverfeeding and what we should now consider overdrinking. His liver\r\nwould not unfrequently get out of order, and he would come down to\r\nbreakfast looking yellow about the eyes. Then the young people knew\r\nthat they had better look out. It is not as a general rule the eating\r\nof sour grapes that causes the children\xe2\x80\x99s teeth to be set on edge.\r\nWell-to-do parents seldom eat many sour grapes; the danger to the\r\nchildren lies in the parents eating too many sweet ones.\r\n\r\nI grant that at first sight it seems very unjust, that the parents\r\nshould have the fun and the children be punished for it, but young\r\npeople should remember that for many years they were part and parcel of\r\ntheir parents and therefore had a good deal of the fun in the person of\r\ntheir parents. If they have forgotten the fun now, that is no more than\r\npeople do who have a headache after having been tipsy overnight. The\r\nman with a headache does not pretend to be a different person from the\r\nman who got drunk, and claim that it is his self of the preceding night\r\nand not his self of this morning who should be punished; no more should\r\noffspring complain of the headache which it has earned when in the\r\nperson of its parents, for the continuation of identity, though not so\r\nimmediately apparent, is just as real in one case as in the other. What\r\nis really hard is when the parents have the fun after the children have\r\nbeen born, and the children are punished for this.\r\n\r\nOn these, his black days, he would take very gloomy views of things and\r\nsay to himself that in spite of all his goodness to them his children\r\ndid not love him. But who can love any man whose liver is out of order?\r\nHow base, he would exclaim to himself, was such ingratitude! How\r\nespecially hard upon himself, who had been such a model son, and always\r\nhonoured and obeyed his parents though they had not spent one hundredth\r\npart of the money upon him which he had lavished upon his own children.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is always the same story,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cthe more young\r\npeople have the more they want, and the less thanks one gets; I have\r\nmade a great mistake; I have been far too lenient with my children;\r\nnever mind, I have done my duty by them, and more; if they fail in\r\ntheirs to me it is a matter between God and them. I, at any rate, am\r\nguiltless. Why, I might have married again and become the father of a\r\nsecond and perhaps more affectionate family, etc., etc.\xe2\x80\x9d He pitied\r\nhimself for the expensive education which he was giving his children;\r\nhe did not see that the education cost the children far more than it\r\ncost him, inasmuch as it cost them the power of earning their living\r\neasily rather than helped them towards it, and ensured their being at\r\nthe mercy of their father for years after they had come to an age when\r\nthey should be independent. A public school education cuts off a boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nretreat; he can no longer become a labourer or a mechanic, and these\r\nare the only people whose tenure of independence is not precarious\xe2\x80\x94with\r\nthe exception of course of those who are born inheritors of money or\r\nwho are placed young in some safe and deep groove. Mr Pontifex saw\r\nnothing of this; all he saw was that he was spending much more money\r\nupon his children than the law would have compelled him to do, and what\r\nmore could you have? Might he not have apprenticed both his sons to\r\ngreengrocers? Might he not even yet do so to-morrow morning if he were\r\nso minded? The possibility of this course being adopted was a favourite\r\ntopic with him when he was out of temper; true, he never did apprentice\r\neither of his sons to greengrocers, but his boys comparing notes\r\ntogether had sometimes come to the conclusion that they wished he\r\nwould.\r\n\r\nAt other times when not quite well he would have them in for the fun of\r\nshaking his will at them. He would in his imagination cut them all out\r\none after another and leave his money to found almshouses, till at last\r\nhe was obliged to put them back, so that he might have the pleasure of\r\ncutting them out again the next time he was in a passion.\r\n\r\nOf course if young people allow their conduct to be in any way\r\ninfluenced by regard to the wills of living persons they are doing very\r\nwrong and must expect to be sufferers in the end, nevertheless the\r\npowers of will-dangling and will-shaking are so liable to abuse and are\r\ncontinually made so great an engine of torture that I would pass a law,\r\nif I could, to incapacitate any man from making a will for three months\r\nfrom the date of each offence in either of the above respects and let\r\nthe bench of magistrates or judge, before whom he has been convicted,\r\ndispose of his property as they shall think right and reasonable if he\r\ndies during the time that his will-making power is suspended.\r\n\r\nMr Pontifex would have the boys into the dining-room. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear John, my\r\ndear Theobald,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say, \xe2\x80\x9clook at me. I began life with nothing\r\nbut the clothes with which my father and mother sent me up to London.\r\nMy father gave me ten shillings and my mother five for pocket money and\r\nI thought them munificent. I never asked my father for a shilling in\r\nthe whole course of my life, nor took aught from him beyond the small\r\nsum he used to allow me monthly till I was in receipt of a salary. I\r\nmade my own way and I shall expect my sons to do the same. Pray don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake it into your heads that I am going to wear my life out making\r\nmoney that my sons may spend it for me. If you want money you must make\r\nit for yourselves as I did, for I give you my word I will not leave a\r\npenny to either of you unless you show that you deserve it. Young\r\npeople seem nowadays to expect all kinds of luxuries and indulgences\r\nwhich were never heard of when I was a boy. Why, my father was a common\r\ncarpenter, and here you are both of you at public schools, costing me\r\never so many hundreds a year, while I at your age was plodding away\r\nbehind a desk in my Uncle Fairlie\xe2\x80\x99s counting house. What should I not\r\nhave done if I had had one half of your advantages? You should become\r\ndukes or found new empires in undiscovered countries, and even then I\r\ndoubt whether you would have done proportionately so much as I have\r\ndone. No, no, I shall see you through school and college and then, if\r\nyou please, you will make your own way in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this manner he would work himself up into such a state of virtuous\r\nindignation that he would sometimes thrash the boys then and there upon\r\nsome pretext invented at the moment.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, as children went, the young Pontifexes were fortunate; there\r\nwould be ten families of young people worse off for one better; they\r\nate and drank good wholesome food, slept in comfortable beds, had the\r\nbest doctors to attend them when they were ill and the best education\r\nthat could be had for money. The want of fresh air does not seem much\r\nto affect the happiness of children in a London alley: the greater part\r\nof them sing and play as though they were on a moor in Scotland. So the\r\nabsence of a genial mental atmosphere is not commonly recognised by\r\nchildren who have never known it. Young people have a marvellous\r\nfaculty of either dying or adapting themselves to circumstances. Even\r\nif they are unhappy\xe2\x80\x94very unhappy\xe2\x80\x94it is astonishing how easily they can\r\nbe prevented from finding it out, or at any rate from attributing it to\r\nany other cause than their own sinfulness.\r\n\r\nTo parents who wish to lead a quiet life I would say: Tell your\r\nchildren that they are very naughty\xe2\x80\x94much naughtier than most children.\r\nPoint to the young people of some acquaintances as models of perfection\r\nand impress your own children with a deep sense of their own\r\ninferiority. You carry so many more guns than they do that they cannot\r\nfight you. This is called moral influence, and it will enable you to\r\nbounce them as much as you please. They think you know and they will\r\nnot have yet caught you lying often enough to suspect that you are not\r\nthe unworldly and scrupulously truthful person which you represent\r\nyourself to be; nor yet will they know how great a coward you are, nor\r\nhow soon you will run away, if they fight you with persistency and\r\njudgement. You keep the dice and throw them both for your children and\r\nyourself. Load them then, for you can easily manage to stop your\r\nchildren from examining them. Tell them how singularly indulgent you\r\nare; insist on the incalculable benefit you conferred upon them,\r\nfirstly in bringing them into the world at all, but more particularly\r\nin bringing them into it as your own children rather than anyone\r\nelse\xe2\x80\x99s. Say that you have their highest interests at stake whenever you\r\nare out of temper and wish to make yourself unpleasant by way of balm\r\nto your soul. Harp much upon these highest interests. Feed them\r\nspiritually upon such brimstone and treacle as the late Bishop of\r\nWinchester\xe2\x80\x99s Sunday stories. You hold all the trump cards, or if you do\r\nnot you can filch them; if you play them with anything like judgement\r\nyou will find yourselves heads of happy, united, God-fearing families,\r\neven as did my old friend Mr Pontifex. True, your children will\r\nprobably find out all about it some day, but not until too late to be\r\nof much service to them or inconvenience to yourself.\r\n\r\nSome satirists have complained of life inasmuch as all the pleasures\r\nbelong to the fore part of it and we must see them dwindle till we are\r\nleft, it may be, with the miseries of a decrepit old age.\r\n\r\nTo me it seems that youth is like spring, an overpraised\r\nseason\xe2\x80\x94delightful if it happen to be a favoured one, but in practice\r\nvery rarely favoured and more remarkable, as a general rule, for biting\r\neast winds than genial breezes. Autumn is the mellower season, and what\r\nwe lose in flowers we more than gain in fruits. Fontenelle at the age\r\nof ninety, being asked what was the happiest time of his life, said he\r\ndid not know that he had ever been much happier than he then was, but\r\nthat perhaps his best years had been those when he was between\r\nfifty-five and seventy-five, and Dr Johnson placed the pleasures of old\r\nage far higher than those of youth. True, in old age we live under the\r\nshadow of Death, which, like a sword of Damocles, may descend at any\r\nmoment, but we have so long found life to be an affair of being rather\r\nfrightened than hurt that we have become like the people who live under\r\nVesuvius, and chance it without much misgiving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nA few words may suffice for the greater number of the young people to\r\nwhom I have been alluding in the foregoing chapter. Eliza and Maria,\r\nthe two elder girls, were neither exactly pretty nor exactly plain, and\r\nwere in all respects model young ladies, but Alethea was exceedingly\r\npretty and of a lively, affectionate disposition, which was in sharp\r\ncontrast with those of her brothers and sisters. There was a trace of\r\nher grandfather, not only in her face, but in her love of fun, of which\r\nher father had none, though not without a certain boisterous and rather\r\ncoarse quasi-humour which passed for wit with many.\r\n\r\nJohn grew up to be a good-looking, gentlemanly fellow, with features a\r\ntrifle too regular and finely chiselled. He dressed himself so nicely,\r\nhad such good address, and stuck so steadily to his books that he\r\nbecame a favourite with his masters; he had, however, an instinct for\r\ndiplomacy, and was less popular with the boys. His father, in spite of\r\nthe lectures he would at times read him, was in a way proud of him as\r\nhe grew older; he saw in him, moreover, one who would probably develop\r\ninto a good man of business, and in whose hands the prospects of his\r\nhouse would not be likely to decline. John knew how to humour his\r\nfather, and was at a comparatively early age admitted to as much of his\r\nconfidence as it was in his nature to bestow on anyone.\r\n\r\nHis brother Theobald was no match for him, knew it, and accepted his\r\nfate. He was not so good-looking as his brother, nor was his address so\r\ngood; as a child he had been violently passionate; now, however, he was\r\nreserved and shy, and, I should say, indolent in mind and body. He was\r\nless tidy than John, less well able to assert himself, and less skilful\r\nin humouring the caprices of his father. I do not think he could have\r\nloved anyone heartily, but there was no one in his family circle who\r\ndid not repress, rather than invite his affection, with the exception\r\nof his sister Alethea, and she was too quick and lively for his\r\nsomewhat morose temper. He was always the scapegoat, and I have\r\nsometimes thought he had two fathers to contend against\xe2\x80\x94his father and\r\nhis brother John; a third and fourth also might almost be added in his\r\nsisters Eliza and Maria. Perhaps if he had felt his bondage very\r\nacutely he would not have put up with it, but he was constitutionally\r\ntimid, and the strong hand of his father knitted him into the closest\r\noutward harmony with his brother and sisters.\r\n\r\nThe boys were of use to their father in one respect. I mean that he\r\nplayed them off against each other. He kept them but poorly supplied\r\nwith pocket money, and to Theobald would urge that the claims of his\r\nelder brother were naturally paramount, while he insisted to John upon\r\nthe fact that he had a numerous family, and would affirm solemnly that\r\nhis expenses were so heavy that at his death there would be very little\r\nto divide. He did not care whether they compared notes or no, provided\r\nthey did not do so in his presence. Theobald did not complain even\r\nbehind his father\xe2\x80\x99s back. I knew him as intimately as anyone was likely\r\nto know him as a child, at school, and again at Cambridge, but he very\r\nrarely mentioned his father\xe2\x80\x99s name even while his father was alive, and\r\nnever once in my hearing afterwards. At school he was not actively\r\ndisliked as his brother was, but he was too dull and deficient in\r\nanimal spirits to be popular.\r\n\r\nBefore he was well out of his frocks it was settled that he was to be a\r\nclergyman. It was seemly that Mr Pontifex, the well-known publisher of\r\nreligious books, should devote at least one of his sons to the Church;\r\nthis might tend to bring business, or at any rate to keep it in the\r\nfirm; besides, Mr Pontifex had more or less interest with bishops and\r\nChurch dignitaries and might hope that some preferment would be offered\r\nto his son through his influence. The boy\xe2\x80\x99s future destiny was kept\r\nwell before his eyes from his earliest childhood and was treated as a\r\nmatter which he had already virtually settled by his acquiescence.\r\nNevertheless a certain show of freedom was allowed him. Mr Pontifex\r\nwould say it was only right to give a boy his option, and was much too\r\nequitable to grudge his son whatever benefit he could derive from this.\r\nHe had the greatest horror, he would exclaim, of driving any young man\r\ninto a profession which he did not like. Far be it from him to put\r\npressure upon a son of his as regards any profession and much less when\r\nso sacred a calling as the ministry was concerned. He would talk in\r\nthis way when there were visitors in the house and when his son was in\r\nthe room. He spoke so wisely and so well that his listening guests\r\nconsidered him a paragon of right-mindedness. He spoke, too, with such\r\nemphasis and his rosy gills and bald head looked so benevolent that it\r\nwas difficult not to be carried away by his discourse. I believe two or\r\nthree heads of families in the neighbourhood gave their sons absolute\r\nliberty of choice in the matter of their professions\xe2\x80\x94and am not sure\r\nthat they had not afterwards considerable cause to regret having done\r\nso. The visitors, seeing Theobald look shy and wholly unmoved by the\r\nexhibition of so much consideration for his wishes, would remark to\r\nthemselves that the boy seemed hardly likely to be equal to his father\r\nand would set him down as an unenthusiastic youth, who ought to have\r\nmore life in him and be more sensible of his advantages than he\r\nappeared to be.\r\n\r\nNo one believed in the righteousness of the whole transaction more\r\nfirmly than the boy himself; a sense of being ill at ease kept him\r\nsilent, but it was too profound and too much without break for him to\r\nbecome fully alive to it, and come to an understanding with himself. He\r\nfeared the dark scowl which would come over his father\xe2\x80\x99s face upon the\r\nslightest opposition. His father\xe2\x80\x99s violent threats, or coarse sneers,\r\nwould not have been taken _au s\xc3\xa9rieux_ by a stronger boy, but Theobald\r\nwas not a strong boy, and rightly or wrongly, gave his father credit\r\nfor being quite ready to carry his threats into execution. Opposition\r\nhad never got him anything he wanted yet, nor indeed had yielding, for\r\nthe matter of that, unless he happened to want exactly what his father\r\nwanted for him. If he had ever entertained thoughts of resistance, he\r\nhad none now, and the power to oppose was so completely lost for want\r\nof exercise that hardly did the wish remain; there was nothing left\r\nsave dull acquiescence as of an ass crouched between two burdens. He\r\nmay have had an ill-defined sense of ideals that were not his actuals;\r\nhe might occasionally dream of himself as a soldier or a sailor far\r\naway in foreign lands, or even as a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s boy upon the wolds, but\r\nthere was not enough in him for there to be any chance of his turning\r\nhis dreams into realities, and he drifted on with his stream, which was\r\na slow, and, I am afraid, a muddy one.\r\n\r\nI think the Church Catechism has a good deal to do with the unhappy\r\nrelations which commonly even now exist between parents and children.\r\nThat work was written too exclusively from the parental point of view;\r\nthe person who composed it did not get a few children to come in and\r\nhelp him; he was clearly not young himself, nor should I say it was the\r\nwork of one who liked children\xe2\x80\x94in spite of the words \xe2\x80\x9cmy good child\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhich, if I remember rightly, are once put into the mouth of the\r\ncatechist and, after all, carry a harsh sound with them. The general\r\nimpression it leaves upon the mind of the young is that their\r\nwickedness at birth was but very imperfectly wiped out at baptism, and\r\nthat the mere fact of being young at all has something with it that\r\nsavours more or less distinctly of the nature of sin.\r\n\r\nIf a new edition of the work is ever required I should like to\r\nintroduce a few words insisting on the duty of seeking all reasonable\r\npleasure and avoiding all pain that can be honourably avoided. I should\r\nlike to see children taught that they should not say they like things\r\nwhich they do not like, merely because certain other people say they\r\nlike them, and how foolish it is to say they believe this or that when\r\nthey understand nothing about it. If it be urged that these additions\r\nwould make the Catechism too long I would curtail the remarks upon our\r\nduty towards our neighbour and upon the sacraments. In the place of the\r\nparagraph beginning \xe2\x80\x9cI desire my Lord God our Heavenly Father\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nwould\xe2\x80\x94but perhaps I had better return to Theobald, and leave the\r\nrecasting of the Catechism to abler hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Pontifex had set his heart on his son\xe2\x80\x99s becoming a fellow of a\r\ncollege before he became a clergyman. This would provide for him at\r\nonce and would ensure his getting a living if none of his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\necclesiastical friends gave him one. The boy had done just well enough\r\nat school to render this possible, so he was sent to one of the smaller\r\ncolleges at Cambridge and was at once set to read with the best private\r\ntutors that could be found. A system of examination had been adopted a\r\nyear or so before Theobald took his degree which had improved his\r\nchances of a fellowship, for whatever ability he had was classical\r\nrather than mathematical, and this system gave more encouragement to\r\nclassical studies than had been given hitherto.\r\n\r\nTheobald had the sense to see that he had a chance of independence if\r\nhe worked hard, and he liked the notion of becoming a fellow. He\r\ntherefore applied himself, and in the end took a degree which made his\r\ngetting a fellowship in all probability a mere question of time. For a\r\nwhile Mr Pontifex senior was really pleased, and told his son he would\r\npresent him with the works of any standard writer whom he might select.\r\nThe young man chose the works of Bacon, and Bacon accordingly made his\r\nappearance in ten nicely bound volumes. A little inspection, however,\r\nshowed that the copy was a second hand one.\r\n\r\nNow that he had taken his degree the next thing to look forward to was\r\nordination\xe2\x80\x94about which Theobald had thought little hitherto beyond\r\nacquiescing in it as something that would come as a matter of course\r\nsome day. Now, however, it had actually come and was asserting itself\r\nas a thing which should be only a few months off, and this rather\r\nfrightened him inasmuch as there would be no way out of it when he was\r\nonce in it. He did not like the near view of ordination as well as the\r\ndistant one, and even made some feeble efforts to escape, as may be\r\nperceived by the following correspondence which his son Ernest found\r\namong his father\xe2\x80\x99s papers written on gilt-edged paper, in faded ink and\r\ntied neatly round with a piece of tape, but without any note or\r\ncomment. I have altered nothing. The letters are as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Father,\xe2\x80\x94I do not like opening up a question which has been\r\nconsidered settled, but as the time approaches I begin to be very\r\ndoubtful how far I am fitted to be a clergyman. Not, I am thankful to\r\nsay, that I have the faintest doubts about the Church of England, and I\r\ncould subscribe cordially to every one of the thirty-nine articles\r\nwhich do indeed appear to me to be the _ne plus ultra_ of human wisdom,\r\nand Paley, too, leaves no loop-hole for an opponent; but I am sure I\r\nshould be running counter to your wishes if I were to conceal from you\r\nthat I do not feel the inward call to be a minister of the gospel that\r\nI shall have to say I have felt when the Bishop ordains me. I try to\r\nget this feeling, I pray for it earnestly, and sometimes half think\r\nthat I have got it, but in a little time it wears off, and though I\r\nhave no absolute repugnance to being a clergyman and trust that if I am\r\none I shall endeavour to live to the Glory of God and to advance His\r\ninterests upon earth, yet I feel that something more than this is\r\nwanted before I am fully justified in going into the Church. I am aware\r\nthat I have been a great expense to you in spite of my scholarships,\r\nbut you have ever taught me that I should obey my conscience, and my\r\nconscience tells me I should do wrong if I became a clergyman. God may\r\nyet give me the spirit for which I assure you I have been and am\r\ncontinually praying, but He may not, and in that case would it not be\r\nbetter for me to try and look out for something else? I know that\r\nneither you nor John wish me to go into your business, nor do I\r\nunderstand anything about money matters, but is there nothing else that\r\nI can do? I do not like to ask you to maintain me while I go in for\r\nmedicine or the bar; but when I get my fellowship, which should not be\r\nlong first, I will endeavour to cost you nothing further, and I might\r\nmake a little money by writing or taking pupils. I trust you will not\r\nthink this letter improper; nothing is further from my wish than to\r\ncause you any uneasiness. I hope you will make allowance for my present\r\nfeelings which, indeed, spring from nothing but from that respect for\r\nmy conscience which no one has so often instilled into me as yourself.\r\nPray let me have a few lines shortly. I hope your cold is better. With\r\nlove to Eliza and Maria, I am, your affectionate son,\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHEOBALD PONTIFEX.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Theobald,\xe2\x80\x94I can enter into your feelings and have no wish to\r\nquarrel with your expression of them. It is quite right and natural\r\nthat you should feel as you do except as regards one passage, the\r\nimpropriety of which you will yourself doubtless feel upon reflection,\r\nand to which I will not further allude than to say that it has wounded\r\nme. You should not have said \xe2\x80\x98in spite of my scholarships.\xe2\x80\x99 It was only\r\nproper that if you could do anything to assist me in bearing the heavy\r\nburden of your education, the money should be, as it was, made over to\r\nmyself. Every line in your letter convinces me that you are under the\r\ninfluence of a morbid sensitiveness which is one of the devil\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfavourite devices for luring people to their destruction. I have, as\r\nyou say, been at great expense with your education. Nothing has been\r\nspared by me to give you the advantages, which, as an English\r\ngentleman, I was anxious to afford my son, but I am not prepared to see\r\nthat expense thrown away and to have to begin again from the beginning,\r\nmerely because you have taken some foolish scruples into your head,\r\nwhich you should resist as no less unjust to yourself than to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t give way to that restless desire for change which is the bane of\r\nso many persons of both sexes at the present day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you needn\xe2\x80\x99t be ordained: nobody will compel you; you are\r\nperfectly free; you are twenty-three years of age, and should know your\r\nown mind; but why not have known it sooner, instead of never so much as\r\nbreathing a hint of opposition until I have had all the expense of\r\nsending you to the University, which I should never have done unless I\r\nhad believed you to have made up your mind about taking orders? I have\r\nletters from you in which you express the most perfect willingness to\r\nbe ordained, and your brother and sisters will bear me out in saying\r\nthat no pressure of any sort has been put upon you. You mistake your\r\nown mind, and are suffering from a nervous timidity which may be very\r\nnatural but may not the less be pregnant with serious consequences to\r\nyourself. I am not at all well, and the anxiety occasioned by your\r\nletter is naturally preying upon me. May God guide you to a better\r\njudgement.\xe2\x80\x94Your affectionate father,\r\n\r\n\r\nG. PONTIFEX.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the receipt of this letter Theobald plucked up his spirits. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nfather,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9ctells me I need not be ordained if I do\r\nnot like. I do not like, and therefore I will not be ordained. But what\r\nwas the meaning of the words \xe2\x80\x98pregnant with serious consequences to\r\nyourself\xe2\x80\x99? Did there lurk a threat under these words\xe2\x80\x94though it was\r\nimpossible to lay hold of it or of them? Were they not intended to\r\nproduce all the effect of a threat without being actually threatening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheobald knew his father well enough to be little likely to\r\nmisapprehend his meaning, but having ventured so far on the path of\r\nopposition, and being really anxious to get out of being ordained if he\r\ncould, he determined to venture farther. He accordingly wrote the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear father,\xe2\x80\x94You tell me\xe2\x80\x94and I heartily thank you\xe2\x80\x94that no one will\r\ncompel me to be ordained. I knew you would not press ordination upon me\r\nif my conscience was seriously opposed to it; I have therefore resolved\r\non giving up the idea, and believe that if you will continue to allow\r\nme what you do at present, until I get my fellowship, which should not\r\nbe long, I will then cease putting you to further expense. I will make\r\nup my mind as soon as possible what profession I will adopt, and will\r\nlet you know at once.\xe2\x80\x94Your affectionate son,\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEOBALD PONTIFEX.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe remaining letter, written by return of post, must now be given. It\r\nhas the merit of brevity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Theobald,\xe2\x80\x94I have received yours. I am at a loss to conceive its\r\nmotive, but am very clear as to its effect. You shall not receive a\r\nsingle sixpence from me till you come to your senses. Should you\r\npersist in your folly and wickedness, I am happy to remember that I\r\nhave yet other children whose conduct I can depend upon to be a source\r\nof credit and happiness to me.\xe2\x80\x94Your affectionate but troubled father,\r\n\r\n\r\n G. PONTIFEX.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI do not know the immediate sequel to the foregoing correspondence, but\r\nit all came perfectly right in the end. Either Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s heart failed\r\nhim, or he interpreted the outward shove which his father gave him, as\r\nthe inward call for which I have no doubt he prayed with great\r\nearnestness\xe2\x80\x94for he was a firm believer in the efficacy of prayer. And\r\nso am I under certain circumstances. Tennyson has said that more things\r\nare wrought by prayer than this world dreams of, but he has wisely\r\nrefrained from saying whether they are good things or bad things. It\r\nmight perhaps be as well if the world were to dream of, or even become\r\nwide awake to, some of the things that are being wrought by prayer. But\r\nthe question is avowedly difficult. In the end Theobald got his\r\nfellowship by a stroke of luck very soon after taking his degree, and\r\nwas ordained in the autumn of the same year, 1825.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Allaby was rector of Crampsford, a village a few miles from\r\nCambridge. He, too, had taken a good degree, had got a fellowship, and\r\nin the course of time had accepted a college living of about \xc2\xa3400 a\r\nyear and a house. His private income did not exceed \xc2\xa3200 a year. On\r\nresigning his fellowship he married a woman a good deal younger than\r\nhimself who bore him eleven children, nine of whom\xe2\x80\x94two sons and seven\r\ndaughters\xe2\x80\x94were living. The two eldest daughters had married fairly\r\nwell, but at the time of which I am now writing there were still five\r\nunmarried, of ages varying between thirty and twenty-two\xe2\x80\x94and the sons\r\nwere neither of them yet off their father\xe2\x80\x99s hands. It was plain that if\r\nanything were to happen to Mr Allaby the family would be left poorly\r\noff, and this made both Mr and Mrs Allaby as unhappy as it ought to\r\nhave made them.\r\n\r\nReader, did you ever have an income at best none too large, which died\r\nwith you all except \xc2\xa3200 a year? Did you ever at the same time have two\r\nsons who must be started in life somehow, and five daughters still\r\nunmarried for whom you would only be too thankful to find husbands\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nyou knew how to find them? If morality is that which, on the whole,\r\nbrings a man peace in his declining years\xe2\x80\x94if, that is to say, it is not\r\nan utter swindle, can you under these circumstances flatter yourself\r\nthat you have led a moral life?\r\n\r\nAnd this, even though your wife has been so good a woman that you have\r\nnot grown tired of her, and has not fallen into such ill-health as\r\nlowers your own health in sympathy; and though your family has grown up\r\nvigorous, amiable, and blessed with common sense. I know many old men\r\nand women who are reputed moral, but who are living with partners whom\r\nthey have long ceased to love, or who have ugly disagreeable maiden\r\ndaughters for whom they have never been able to find husbands\xe2\x80\x94daughters\r\nwhom they loathe and by whom they are loathed in secret, or sons whose\r\nfolly or extravagance is a perpetual wear and worry to them. Is it\r\nmoral for a man to have brought such things upon himself? Someone\r\nshould do for morals what that old Pecksniff Bacon has obtained the\r\ncredit of having done for science.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Mr and Mrs Allaby. Mrs Allaby talked about having\r\nmarried two of her daughters as though it had been the easiest thing in\r\nthe world. She talked in this way because she heard other mothers do\r\nso, but in her heart of hearts she did not know how she had done it,\r\nnor indeed, if it had been her doing at all. First there had been a\r\nyoung man in connection with whom she had tried to practise certain\r\nmanoeuvres which she had rehearsed in imagination over and over again,\r\nbut which she found impossible to apply in practice. Then there had\r\nbeen weeks of a _wurra wurra_ of hopes and fears and little stratagems\r\nwhich as often as not proved injudicious, and then somehow or other in\r\nthe end, there lay the young man bound and with an arrow through his\r\nheart at her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s feet. It seemed to her to be all a fluke which\r\nshe could have little or no hope of repeating. She had indeed repeated\r\nit once, and might perhaps with good luck repeat it yet once again\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nfive times over! It was awful: why she would rather have three\r\nconfinements than go through the wear and tear of marrying a single\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it had got to be done, and poor Mrs Allaby never looked at\r\na young man without an eye to his being a future son-in-law. Papas and\r\nmammas sometimes ask young men whether their intentions are honourable\r\ntowards their daughters. I think young men might occasionally ask papas\r\nand mammas whether their intentions are honourable before they accept\r\ninvitations to houses where there are still unmarried daughters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t afford a curate, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Allaby to his wife when the\r\npair were discussing what was next to be done. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be better to\r\nget some young man to come and help me for a time upon a Sunday. A\r\nguinea a Sunday will do this, and we can chop and change till we get\r\nsomeone who suits.\xe2\x80\x9d So it was settled that Mr Allaby\xe2\x80\x99s health was not\r\nso strong as it had been, and that he stood in need of help in the\r\nperformance of his Sunday duty.\r\n\r\nMrs Allaby had a great friend\xe2\x80\x94a certain Mrs Cowey, wife of the\r\ncelebrated Professor Cowey. She was what was called a truly spiritually\r\nminded woman, a trifle portly, with an incipient beard, and an\r\nextensive connection among undergraduates, more especially among those\r\nwho were inclined to take part in the great evangelical movement which\r\nwas then at its height. She gave evening parties once a fortnight at\r\nwhich prayer was part of the entertainment. She was not only\r\nspiritually minded, but, as enthusiastic Mrs Allaby used to exclaim,\r\nshe was a thorough woman of the world at the same time and had such a\r\nfund of strong masculine good sense. She too had daughters, but, as she\r\nused to say to Mrs Allaby, she had been less fortunate than Mrs Allaby\r\nherself, for one by one they had married and left her so that her old\r\nage would have been desolate indeed if her Professor had not been\r\nspared to her.\r\n\r\nMrs Cowey, of course, knew the run of all the bachelor clergy in the\r\nUniversity, and was the very person to assist Mrs Allaby in finding an\r\neligible assistant for her husband, so this last named lady drove over\r\none morning in the November of 1825, by arrangement, to take an early\r\ndinner with Mrs Cowey and spend the afternoon. After dinner the two\r\nladies retired together, and the business of the day began. How they\r\nfenced, how they saw through one another, with what loyalty they\r\npretended not to see through one another, with what gentle dalliance\r\nthey prolonged the conversation discussing the spiritual fitness of\r\nthis or that deacon, and the other pros and cons connected with him\r\nafter his spiritual fitness had been disposed of, all this must be left\r\nto the imagination of the reader. Mrs Cowey had been so accustomed to\r\nscheming on her own account that she would scheme for anyone rather\r\nthan not scheme at all. Many mothers turned to her in their hour of\r\nneed and, provided they were spiritually minded, Mrs Cowey never failed\r\nto do her best for them; if the marriage of a young Bachelor of Arts\r\nwas not made in Heaven, it was probably made, or at any rate attempted,\r\nin Mrs Cowey\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room. On the present occasion all the deacons of\r\nthe University in whom there lurked any spark of promise were\r\nexhaustively discussed, and the upshot was that our friend Theobald was\r\ndeclared by Mrs Cowey to be about the best thing she could do that\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that he\xe2\x80\x99s a particularly fascinating young man, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mrs Cowey, \xe2\x80\x9cand he\xe2\x80\x99s only a second son, but then he\xe2\x80\x99s got his\r\nfellowship, and even the second son of such a man as Mr Pontifex the\r\npublisher should have something very comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy yes, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mrs Allaby complacently, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s what one\r\nrather feels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nThe interview, like all other good things had to come to an end; the\r\ndays were short, and Mrs Allaby had a six miles\xe2\x80\x99 drive to Crampsford.\r\nWhen she was muffled up and had taken her seat, Mr Allaby\xe2\x80\x99s _factotum_,\r\nJames, could perceive no change in her appearance, and little knew what\r\na series of delightful visions he was driving home along with his\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\nProfessor Cowey had published works through Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s father, and\r\nTheobald had on this account been taken in tow by Mrs Cowey from the\r\nbeginning of his University career. She had had her eye upon him for\r\nsome time past, and almost as much felt it her duty to get him off her\r\nlist of young men for whom wives had to be provided, as poor Mrs Allaby\r\ndid to try and get a husband for one of her daughters. She now wrote\r\nand asked him to come and see her, in terms that awakened his\r\ncuriosity. When he came she broached the subject of Mr Allaby\xe2\x80\x99s failing\r\nhealth, and after the smoothing away of such difficulties as were only\r\nMrs Cowey\xe2\x80\x99s due, considering the interest she had taken, it was allowed\r\nto come to pass that Theobald should go to Crampsford for six\r\nsuccessive Sundays and take the half of Mr Allaby\xe2\x80\x99s duty at half a\r\nguinea a Sunday, for Mrs Cowey cut down the usual stipend mercilessly,\r\nand Theobald was not strong enough to resist.\r\n\r\nIgnorant of the plots which were being prepared for his peace of mind\r\nand with no idea beyond that of earning his three guineas, and perhaps\r\nof astonishing the inhabitants of Crampsford by his academic learning,\r\nTheobald walked over to the Rectory one Sunday morning early in\r\nDecember\xe2\x80\x94a few weeks only after he had been ordained. He had taken a\r\ngreat deal of pains with his sermon, which was on the subject of\r\ngeology\xe2\x80\x94then coming to the fore as a theological bugbear. He showed\r\nthat so far as geology was worth anything at all\xe2\x80\x94and he was too liberal\r\nentirely to pooh-pooh it\xe2\x80\x94it confirmed the absolutely historical\r\ncharacter of the Mosaic account of the Creation as given in Genesis.\r\nAny phenomena which at first sight appeared to make against this view\r\nwere only partial phenomena and broke down upon investigation. Nothing\r\ncould be in more excellent taste, and when Theobald adjourned to the\r\nrectory, where he was to dine between the services, Mr Allaby\r\ncomplimented him warmly upon his d\xc3\xa9but, while the ladies of the family\r\ncould hardly find words with which to express their admiration.\r\n\r\nTheobald knew nothing about women. The only women he had been thrown in\r\ncontact with were his sisters, two of whom were always correcting him,\r\nand a few school friends whom these had got their father to ask to\r\nElmhurst. These young ladies had either been so shy that they and\r\nTheobald had never amalgamated, or they had been supposed to be clever\r\nand had said smart things to him. He did not say smart things himself\r\nand did not want other people to say them. Besides, they talked about\r\nmusic\xe2\x80\x94and he hated music\xe2\x80\x94or pictures\xe2\x80\x94and he hated pictures\xe2\x80\x94or books\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nexcept the classics he hated books. And then sometimes he was wanted to\r\ndance with them, and he did not know how to dance, and did not want to\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nAt Mrs Cowey\xe2\x80\x99s parties again he had seen some young ladies and had been\r\nintroduced to them. He had tried to make himself agreeable, but was\r\nalways left with the impression that he had not been successful. The\r\nyoung ladies of Mrs Cowey\xe2\x80\x99s set were by no means the most attractive\r\nthat might have been found in the University, and Theobald may be\r\nexcused for not losing his heart to the greater number of them, while\r\nif for a minute or two he was thrown in with one of the prettier and\r\nmore agreeable girls he was almost immediately cut out by someone less\r\nbashful than himself, and sneaked off, feeling as far as the fair sex\r\nwas concerned, like the impotent man at the pool of Bethesda.\r\n\r\nWhat a really nice girl might have done with him I cannot tell, but\r\nfate had thrown none such in his way except his youngest sister\r\nAlethea, whom he might perhaps have liked if she had not been his\r\nsister. The result of his experience was that women had never done him\r\nany good and he was not accustomed to associate them with any pleasure;\r\nif there was a part of Hamlet in connection with them it had been so\r\ncompletely cut out in the edition of the play in which he was required\r\nto act that he had come to disbelieve in its existence. As for kissing,\r\nhe had never kissed a woman in his life except his sister\xe2\x80\x94and my own\r\nsisters when we were all small children together. Over and above these\r\nkisses, he had until quite lately been required to imprint a solemn\r\nflabby kiss night and morning upon his father\xe2\x80\x99s cheek, and this, to the\r\nbest of my belief, was the extent of Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge in the matter\r\nof kissing, at the time of which I am now writing. The result of the\r\nforegoing was that he had come to dislike women, as mysterious beings\r\nwhose ways were not as his ways, nor their thoughts as his thoughts.\r\n\r\nWith these antecedents Theobald naturally felt rather bashful on\r\nfinding himself the admired of five strange young ladies. I remember\r\nwhen I was a boy myself I was once asked to take tea at a girls\xe2\x80\x99 school\r\nwhere one of my sisters was boarding. I was then about twelve years\r\nold. Everything went off well during tea-time, for the Lady Principal\r\nof the establishment was present. But there came a time when she went\r\naway and I was left alone with the girls. The moment the mistress\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nback was turned the head girl, who was about my own age, came up,\r\npointed her finger at me, made a face and said solemnly, \xe2\x80\x9cA na-a-sty\r\nbo-o-y!\xe2\x80\x9d All the girls followed her in rotation making the same gesture\r\nand the same reproach upon my being a boy. It gave me a great scare. I\r\nbelieve I cried, and I know it was a long time before I could again\r\nface a girl without a strong desire to run away.\r\n\r\nTheobald felt at first much as I had myself done at the girls\xe2\x80\x99 school,\r\nbut the Miss Allabys did not tell him he was a nasty bo-o-oy. Their\r\npapa and mamma were so cordial and they themselves lifted him so deftly\r\nover conversational stiles that before dinner was over Theobald thought\r\nthe family to be a really very charming one, and felt as though he were\r\nbeing appreciated in a way to which he had not hitherto been\r\naccustomed.\r\n\r\nWith dinner his shyness wore off. He was by no means plain, his\r\nacademic prestige was very fair. There was nothing about him to lay\r\nhold of as unconventional or ridiculous; the impression he created upon\r\nthe young ladies was quite as favourable as that which they had created\r\nupon himself; for they knew not much more about men than he about\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was gone, the harmony of the establishment was broken by\r\na storm which arose upon the question which of them it should be who\r\nshould become Mrs Pontifex. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dears,\xe2\x80\x9d said their father, when he saw\r\nthat they did not seem likely to settle the matter among themselves,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait till to-morrow, and then play at cards for him.\xe2\x80\x9d Having said\r\nwhich he retired to his study, where he took a nightly glass of whisky\r\nand a pipe of tobacco.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning saw Theobald in his rooms coaching a pupil, and the\r\nMiss Allabys in the eldest Miss Allaby\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom playing at cards with\r\nTheobald for the stakes.\r\n\r\nThe winner was Christina, the second unmarried daughter, then just\r\ntwenty-seven years old and therefore four years older than Theobald.\r\nThe younger sisters complained that it was throwing a husband away to\r\nlet Christina try and catch him, for she was so much older that she had\r\nno chance; but Christina showed fight in a way not usual with her, for\r\nshe was by nature yielding and good tempered. Her mother thought it\r\nbetter to back her up, so the two dangerous ones were packed off then\r\nand there on visits to friends some way off, and those alone allowed to\r\nremain at home whose loyalty could be depended upon. The brothers did\r\nnot even suspect what was going on and believed their father\xe2\x80\x99s getting\r\nassistance was because he really wanted it.\r\n\r\nThe sisters who remained at home kept their words and gave Christina\r\nall the help they could, for over and above their sense of fair play\r\nthey reflected that the sooner Theobald was landed, the sooner another\r\ndeacon might be sent for who might be won by themselves. So quickly was\r\nall managed that the two unreliable sisters were actually out of the\r\nhouse before Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s next visit\xe2\x80\x94which was on the Sunday following\r\nhis first.\r\n\r\nThis time Theobald felt quite at home in the house of his new\r\nfriends\xe2\x80\x94for so Mrs Allaby insisted that he should call them. She took,\r\nshe said, such a motherly interest in young men, especially in\r\nclergymen. Theobald believed every word she said, as he had believed\r\nhis father and all his elders from his youth up. Christina sat next him\r\nat dinner and played her cards no less judiciously than she had played\r\nthem in her sister\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. She smiled (and her smile was one of her\r\nstrong points) whenever he spoke to her; she went through all her\r\nlittle artlessnesses and set forth all her little wares in what she\r\nbelieved to be their most taking aspect. Who can blame her? Theobald\r\nwas not the ideal she had dreamed of when reading Byron upstairs with\r\nher sisters, but he was an actual within the bounds of possibility, and\r\nafter all not a bad actual as actuals went. What else could she do? Run\r\naway? She dared not. Marry beneath her and be considered a disgrace to\r\nher family? She dared not. Remain at home and become an old maid and be\r\nlaughed at? Not if she could help it. She did the only thing that could\r\nreasonably be expected. She was drowning; Theobald might be only a\r\nstraw, but she could catch at him and catch at him she accordingly did.\r\n\r\nIf the course of true love never runs smooth, the course of true\r\nmatch-making sometimes does so. The only ground for complaint in the\r\npresent case was that it was rather slow. Theobald fell into the part\r\nassigned to him more easily than Mrs Cowey and Mrs Allaby had dared to\r\nhope. He was softened by Christina\xe2\x80\x99s winning manners: he admired the\r\nhigh moral tone of everything she said; her sweetness towards her\r\nsisters and her father and mother, her readiness to undertake any small\r\nburden which no one else seemed willing to undertake, her sprightly\r\nmanners, all were fascinating to one who, though unused to woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsociety, was still a human being. He was flattered by her unobtrusive\r\nbut obviously sincere admiration for himself; she seemed to see him in\r\na more favourable light, and to understand him better than anyone\r\noutside of this charming family had ever done. Instead of snubbing him\r\nas his father, brother and sisters did, she drew him out, listened\r\nattentively to all he chose to say, and evidently wanted him to say\r\nstill more. He told a college friend that he knew he was in love now;\r\nhe really was, for he liked Miss Allaby\xe2\x80\x99s society much better than that\r\nof his sisters.\r\n\r\nOver and above the recommendations already enumerated, she had another\r\nin the possession of what was supposed to be a very beautiful contralto\r\nvoice. Her voice was certainly contralto, for she could not reach\r\nhigher than D in the treble; its only defect was that it did not go\r\ncorrespondingly low in the bass: in those days, however, a contralto\r\nvoice was understood to include even a soprano if the soprano could not\r\nreach soprano notes, and it was not necessary that it should have the\r\nquality which we now assign to contralto. What her voice wanted in\r\nrange and power was made up in the feeling with which she sang. She had\r\ntransposed \xe2\x80\x9cAngels ever bright and fair\xe2\x80\x9d into a lower key, so as to\r\nmake it suit her voice, thus proving, as her mamma said, that she had a\r\nthorough knowledge of the laws of harmony; not only did she do this,\r\nbut at every pause added an embellishment of arpeggios from one end to\r\nthe other of the keyboard, on a principle which her governess had\r\ntaught her; she thus added life and interest to an air which\r\neveryone\xe2\x80\x94so she said\xe2\x80\x94must feel to be rather heavy in the form in which\r\nHandel left it. As for her governess, she indeed had been a rarely\r\naccomplished musician: she was a pupil of the famous Dr Clarke of\r\nCambridge, and used to play the overture to _Atalanta_, arranged by\r\nMazzinghi. Nevertheless, it was some time before Theobald could bring\r\nhis courage to the sticking point of actually proposing. He made it\r\nquite clear that he believed himself to be much smitten, but month\r\nafter month went by, during which there was still so much hope in\r\nTheobald that Mr Allaby dared not discover that he was able to do his\r\nduty for himself, and was getting impatient at the number of\r\nhalf-guineas he was disbursing\xe2\x80\x94and yet there was no proposal.\r\nChristina\xe2\x80\x99s mother assured him that she was the best daughter in the\r\nwhole world, and would be a priceless treasure to the man who married\r\nher. Theobald echoed Mrs Allaby\xe2\x80\x99s sentiments with warmth, but still,\r\nthough he visited the Rectory two or three times a week, besides coming\r\nover on Sundays\xe2\x80\x94he did not propose. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is heart-whole yet, dear Mr\r\nPontifex,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Allaby, one day, \xe2\x80\x9cat least I believe she is. It is\r\nnot for want of admirers\xe2\x80\x94oh! no\xe2\x80\x94she has had her full share of these,\r\nbut she is too, too difficult to please. I think, however, she would\r\nfall before a _great and good_ man.\xe2\x80\x9d And she looked hard at Theobald,\r\nwho blushed; but the days went by and still he did not propose.\r\n\r\nAnother time Theobald actually took Mrs Cowey into his confidence, and\r\nthe reader may guess what account of Christina he got from her. Mrs\r\nCowey tried the jealousy manoeuvre and hinted at a possible rival.\r\nTheobald was, or pretended to be, very much alarmed; a little\r\nrudimentary pang of jealousy shot across his bosom and he began to\r\nbelieve with pride that he was not only in love, but desperately in\r\nlove or he would never feel so jealous. Nevertheless, day after day\r\nstill went by and he did not propose.\r\n\r\nThe Allabys behaved with great judgement. They humoured him till his\r\nretreat was practically cut off, though he still flattered himself that\r\nit was open. One day about six months after Theobald had become an\r\nalmost daily visitor at the Rectory the conversation happened to turn\r\nupon long engagements. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like long engagements, Mr Allaby, do\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d said Theobald imprudently. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Allaby in a pointed\r\ntone, \xe2\x80\x9cnor long courtships,\xe2\x80\x9d and he gave Theobald a look which he could\r\nnot pretend to misunderstand. He went back to Cambridge as fast as he\r\ncould go, and in dread of the conversation with Mr Allaby which he felt\r\nto be impending, composed the following letter which he despatched that\r\nsame afternoon by a private messenger to Crampsford. The letter was as\r\nfollows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest Miss Christina,\xe2\x80\x94I do not know whether you have guessed the\r\nfeelings that I have long entertained for you\xe2\x80\x94feelings which I have\r\nconcealed as much as I could through fear of drawing you into an\r\nengagement which, if you enter into it, must be prolonged for a\r\nconsiderable time, but, however this may be, it is out of my power to\r\nconceal them longer; I love you, ardently, devotedly, and send these\r\nfew lines asking you to be my wife, because I dare not trust my tongue\r\nto give adequate expression to the magnitude of my affection for you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot pretend to offer you a heart which has never known either\r\nlove or disappointment. I have loved already, and my heart was years in\r\nrecovering from the grief I felt at seeing her become another\xe2\x80\x99s. That,\r\nhowever, is over, and having seen yourself I rejoice over a\r\ndisappointment which I thought at one time would have been fatal to me.\r\nIt has left me a less ardent lover than I should perhaps otherwise have\r\nbeen, but it has increased tenfold my power of appreciating your many\r\ncharms and my desire that you should become my wife. Please let me have\r\na few lines of answer by the bearer to let me know whether or not my\r\nsuit is accepted. If you accept me I will at once come and talk the\r\nmatter over with Mr and Mrs Allaby, whom I shall hope one day to be\r\nallowed to call father and mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to warn you that in the event of your consenting to be my wife\r\nit may be years before our union can be consummated, for I cannot marry\r\ntill a college living is offered me. If, therefore, you see fit to\r\nreject me, I shall be grieved rather than surprised.\xe2\x80\x94Ever most\r\ndevotedly yours,\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHEOBALD PONTIFEX.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd this was all that his public school and University education had\r\nbeen able to do for Theobald! Nevertheless for his own part he thought\r\nhis letter rather a good one, and congratulated himself in particular\r\nupon his cleverness in inventing the story of a previous attachment,\r\nbehind which he intended to shelter himself if Christina should\r\ncomplain of any lack of fervour in his behaviour to her.\r\n\r\nI need not give Christina\xe2\x80\x99s answer, which of course was to accept. Much\r\nas Theobald feared old Mr Allaby I do not think he would have wrought\r\nup his courage to the point of actually proposing but for the fact of\r\nthe engagement being necessarily a long one, during which a dozen\r\nthings might turn up to break it off. However much he may have\r\ndisapproved of long engagements for other people, I doubt whether he\r\nhad any particular objection to them in his own case. A pair of lovers\r\nare like sunset and sunrise: there are such things every day but we\r\nvery seldom see them. Theobald posed as the most ardent lover\r\nimaginable, but, to use the vulgarism for the moment in fashion, it was\r\nall \xe2\x80\x9cside.\xe2\x80\x9d Christina was in love, as indeed she had been twenty times\r\nalready. But then Christina was impressionable and could not even hear\r\nthe name \xe2\x80\x9cMissolonghi\xe2\x80\x9d mentioned without bursting into tears. When\r\nTheobald accidentally left his sermon case behind him one Sunday, she\r\nslept with it in her bosom and was forlorn when she had as it were to\r\ndisgorge it on the following Sunday; but I do not think Theobald ever\r\ntook so much as an old toothbrush of Christina\xe2\x80\x99s to bed with him. Why,\r\nI knew a young man once who got hold of his mistress\xe2\x80\x99s skates and slept\r\nwith them for a fortnight and cried when he had to give them up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nTheobald\xe2\x80\x99s engagement was all very well as far as it went, but there\r\nwas an old gentleman with a bald head and rosy cheeks in a\r\ncounting-house in Paternoster Row who must sooner or later be told of\r\nwhat his son had in view, and Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s heart fluttered when he asked\r\nhimself what view this old gentleman was likely to take of the\r\nsituation. The murder, however, had to come out, and Theobald and his\r\nintended, perhaps imprudently, resolved on making a clean breast of it\r\nat once. He wrote what he and Christina, who helped him to draft the\r\nletter, thought to be everything that was filial, and expressed himself\r\nas anxious to be married with the least possible delay. He could not\r\nhelp saying this, as Christina was at his shoulder, and he knew it was\r\nsafe, for his father might be trusted not to help him. He wound up by\r\nasking his father to use any influence that might be at his command to\r\nhelp him to get a living, inasmuch as it might be years before a\r\ncollege living fell vacant, and he saw no other chance of being able to\r\nmarry, for neither he nor his intended had any money except Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfellowship, which would, of course, lapse on his taking a wife.\r\n\r\nAny step of Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s was sure to be objectionable in his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes, but that at three-and-twenty he should want to marry a penniless\r\ngirl who was four years older than himself, afforded a golden\r\nopportunity which the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x94for so I may now call him, as he\r\nwas at least sixty\xe2\x80\x94embraced with characteristic eagerness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ineffable folly,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, on receiving his son\xe2\x80\x99s letter, \xe2\x80\x9cof\r\nyour fancied passion for Miss Allaby fills me with the gravest\r\napprehensions. Making every allowance for a lover\xe2\x80\x99s blindness, I still\r\nhave no doubt that the lady herself is a well-conducted and amiable\r\nyoung person, who would not disgrace our family, but were she ten times\r\nmore desirable as a daughter-in-law than I can allow myself to hope,\r\nyour joint poverty is an insuperable objection to your marriage. I have\r\nfour other children besides yourself, and my expenses do not permit me\r\nto save money. This year they have been especially heavy, indeed I have\r\nhad to purchase two not inconsiderable pieces of land which happened to\r\ncome into the market and were necessary to complete a property which I\r\nhave long wanted to round off in this way. I gave you an education\r\nregardless of expense, which has put you in possession of a comfortable\r\nincome, at an age when many young men are dependent. I have thus\r\nstarted you fairly in life, and may claim that you should cease to be a\r\ndrag upon me further. Long engagements are proverbially unsatisfactory,\r\nand in the present case the prospect seems interminable. What interest,\r\npray, do you suppose I have that I could get a living for you? Can I go\r\nup and down the country begging people to provide for my son because he\r\nhas taken it into his head to want to get married without sufficient\r\nmeans?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not wish to write unkindly, nothing can be farther from my real\r\nfeelings towards you, but there is often more kindness in plain\r\nspeaking than in any amount of soft words which can end in no\r\nsubstantial performance. Of course, I bear in mind that you are of age,\r\nand can therefore please yourself, but if you choose to claim the\r\nstrict letter of the law, and act without consideration for your\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, you must not be surprised if you one day find that I\r\nhave claimed a like liberty for myself.\xe2\x80\x94Believe me, your affectionate\r\nfather,\r\n\r\n\r\nG. PONTIFEX.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI found this letter along with those already given and a few more which\r\nI need not give, but throughout which the same tone prevails, and in\r\nall of which there is the more or less obvious shake of the will near\r\nthe end of the letter. Remembering Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s general dumbness\r\nconcerning his father for the many years I knew him after his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath, there was an eloquence in the preservation of the letters and in\r\ntheir endorsement \xe2\x80\x9cLetters from my father,\xe2\x80\x9d which seemed to have with\r\nit some faint odour of health and nature.\r\n\r\nTheobald did not show his father\xe2\x80\x99s letter to Christina, nor, indeed, I\r\nbelieve to anyone. He was by nature secretive, and had been repressed\r\ntoo much and too early to be capable of railing or blowing off steam\r\nwhere his father was concerned. His sense of wrong was still\r\ninarticulate, felt as a dull dead weight ever present day by day, and\r\nif he woke at night-time still continually present, but he hardly knew\r\nwhat it was. I was about the closest friend he had, and I saw but\r\nlittle of him, for I could not get on with him for long together. He\r\nsaid I had no reverence; whereas I thought that I had plenty of\r\nreverence for what deserved to be revered, but that the gods which he\r\ndeemed golden were in reality made of baser metal. He never, as I have\r\nsaid, complained of his father to me, and his only other friends were,\r\nlike himself, staid and prim, of evangelical tendencies, and deeply\r\nimbued with a sense of the sinfulness of any act of insubordination to\r\nparents\xe2\x80\x94good young men, in fact\xe2\x80\x94and one cannot blow off steam to a good\r\nyoung man.\r\n\r\nWhen Christina was informed by her lover of his father\xe2\x80\x99s opposition,\r\nand of the time which must probably elapse before they could be\r\nmarried, she offered\xe2\x80\x94with how much sincerity I know not\xe2\x80\x94to set him free\r\nfrom his engagement; but Theobald declined to be released\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnot at\r\nleast,\xe2\x80\x9d as he said, \xe2\x80\x9cat present.\xe2\x80\x9d Christina and Mrs Allaby knew they\r\ncould manage him, and on this not very satisfactory footing the\r\nengagement was continued.\r\n\r\nHis engagement and his refusal to be released at once raised Theobald\r\nin his own good opinion. Dull as he was, he had no small share of quiet\r\nself-approbation. He admired himself for his University distinction,\r\nfor the purity of his life (I said of him once that if he had only a\r\nbetter temper he would be as innocent as a new-laid egg) and for his\r\nunimpeachable integrity in money matters. He did not despair of\r\nadvancement in the Church when he had once got a living, and of course\r\nit was within the bounds of possibility that he might one day become a\r\nBishop, and Christina said she felt convinced that this would\r\nultimately be the case.\r\n\r\nAs was natural for the daughter and intended wife of a clergyman,\r\nChristina\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts ran much upon religion, and she was resolved that\r\neven though an exalted position in this world were denied to her and\r\nTheobald, their virtues should be fully appreciated in the next. Her\r\nreligious opinions coincided absolutely with Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s own, and many a\r\nconversation did she have with him about the glory of God, and the\r\ncompleteness with which they would devote themselves to it, as soon as\r\nTheobald had got his living and they were married. So certain was she\r\nof the great results which would then ensue that she wondered at times\r\nat the blindness shown by Providence towards its own truest interests\r\nin not killing off the rectors who stood between Theobald and his\r\nliving a little faster.\r\n\r\nIn those days people believed with a simple downrightness which I do\r\nnot observe among educated men and women now. It had never so much as\r\ncrossed Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s mind to doubt the literal accuracy of any syllable\r\nin the Bible. He had never seen any book in which this was disputed,\r\nnor met with anyone who doubted it. True, there was just a little scare\r\nabout geology, but there was nothing in it. If it was said that God\r\nmade the world in six days, why He did make it in six days, neither in\r\nmore nor less; if it was said that He put Adam to sleep, took out one\r\nof his ribs and made a woman of it, why it was so as a matter of\r\ncourse. He, Adam, went to sleep as it might be himself, Theobald\r\nPontifex, in a garden, as it might be the garden at Crampsford Rectory\r\nduring the summer months when it was so pretty, only that it was\r\nlarger, and had some tame wild animals in it. Then God came up to him,\r\nas it might be Mr Allaby or his father, dexterously took out one of his\r\nribs without waking him, and miraculously healed the wound so that no\r\ntrace of the operation remained. Finally, God had taken the rib perhaps\r\ninto the greenhouse, and had turned it into just such another young\r\nwoman as Christina. That was how it was done; there was neither\r\ndifficulty nor shadow of difficulty about the matter. Could not God do\r\nanything He liked, and had He not in His own inspired Book told us that\r\nHe had done this?\r\n\r\nThis was the average attitude of fairly educated young men and women\r\ntowards the Mosaic cosmogony fifty, forty, or even twenty years ago.\r\nThe combating of infidelity, therefore, offered little scope for\r\nenterprising young clergymen, nor had the Church awakened to the\r\nactivity which she has since displayed among the poor in our large\r\ntowns. These were then left almost without an effort at resistance or\r\nco-operation to the labours of those who had succeeded Wesley.\r\nMissionary work indeed in heathen countries was being carried on with\r\nsome energy, but Theobald did not feel any call to be a missionary.\r\nChristina suggested this to him more than once, and assured him of the\r\nunspeakable happiness it would be to her to be the wife of a\r\nmissionary, and to share his dangers; she and Theobald might even be\r\nmartyred; of course they would be martyred simultaneously, and\r\nmartyrdom many years hence as regarded from the arbour in the Rectory\r\ngarden was not painful, it would ensure them a glorious future in the\r\nnext world, and at any rate posthumous renown in this\xe2\x80\x94even if they were\r\nnot miraculously restored to life again\xe2\x80\x94and such things had happened\r\nere now in the case of martyrs. Theobald, however, had not been kindled\r\nby Christina\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiasm, so she fell back upon the Church of Rome\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nenemy more dangerous, if possible, than paganism itself. A combat with\r\nRomanism might even yet win for her and Theobald the crown of\r\nmartyrdom. True, the Church of Rome was tolerably quiet just then, but\r\nit was the calm before the storm, of this she was assured, with a\r\nconviction deeper than she could have attained by any argument founded\r\nupon mere reason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe, dearest Theobald,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cwill be ever faithful. We will\r\nstand firm and support one another even in the hour of death itself.\r\nGod in his mercy may spare us from being burnt alive. He may or may not\r\ndo so. Oh Lord\xe2\x80\x9d (and she turned her eyes prayerfully to Heaven), \xe2\x80\x9cspare\r\nmy Theobald, or grant that he may be beheaded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Theobald gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not let us agitate ourselves\r\nunduly. If the hour of trial comes we shall be best prepared to meet it\r\nby having led a quiet unobtrusive life of self-denial and devotion to\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s glory. Such a life let us pray God that it may please Him to\r\nenable us to pray that we may lead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest Theobald,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Christina, drying the tears that had\r\ngathered in her eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are always, always right. Let us be\r\nself-denying, pure, upright, truthful in word and deed.\xe2\x80\x9d She clasped\r\nher hands and looked up to Heaven as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined her lover, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have ever hitherto endeavoured to be\r\nall of these things; we have not been worldly people; let us watch and\r\npray that we may so continue to the end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe moon had risen and the arbour was getting damp, so they adjourned\r\nfurther aspirations for a more convenient season. At other times\r\nChristina pictured herself and Theobald as braving the scorn of almost\r\nevery human being in the achievement of some mighty task which should\r\nredound to the honour of her Redeemer. She could face anything for\r\nthis. But always towards the end of her vision there came a little\r\ncoronation scene high up in the golden regions of the Heavens, and a\r\ndiadem was set upon her head by the Son of Man Himself, amid a host of\r\nangels and archangels who looked on with envy and admiration\xe2\x80\x94and here\r\neven Theobald himself was out of it. If there could be such a thing as\r\nthe Mammon of Righteousness Christina would have assuredly made friends\r\nwith it. Her papa and mamma were very estimable people and would in the\r\ncourse of time receive Heavenly Mansions in which they would be\r\nexceedingly comfortable; so doubtless would her sisters; so perhaps,\r\neven might her brothers; but for herself she felt that a higher destiny\r\nwas preparing, which it was her duty never to lose sight of. The first\r\nstep towards it would be her marriage with Theobald. In spite, however,\r\nof these flights of religious romanticism, Christina was a\r\ngood-tempered kindly-natured girl enough, who, if she had married a\r\nsensible layman\xe2\x80\x94we will say a hotel-keeper\xe2\x80\x94would have developed into a\r\ngood landlady and been deservedly popular with her guests.\r\n\r\nSuch was Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s engaged life. Many a little present passed between\r\nthe pair, and many a small surprise did they prepare pleasantly for one\r\nanother. They never quarrelled, and neither of them ever flirted with\r\nanyone else. Mrs Allaby and his future sisters-in-law idolised Theobald\r\nin spite of its being impossible to get another deacon to come and be\r\nplayed for as long as Theobald was able to help Mr Allaby, which now of\r\ncourse he did free gratis and for nothing; two of the sisters, however,\r\ndid manage to find husbands before Christina was actually married, and\r\non each occasion Theobald played the part of decoy elephant. In the end\r\nonly two out of the seven daughters remained single.\r\n\r\nAfter three or four years, old Mr Pontifex became accustomed to his\r\nson\xe2\x80\x99s engagement and looked upon it as among the things which had now a\r\nprescriptive right to toleration. In the spring of 1831, more than five\r\nyears after Theobald had first walked over to Crampsford, one of the\r\nbest livings in the gift of the College unexpectedly fell vacant, and\r\nwas for various reasons declined by the two fellows senior to Theobald,\r\nwho might each have been expected to take it. The living was then\r\noffered to and of course accepted by Theobald, being in value not less\r\nthan \xc2\xa3500 a year with a suitable house and garden. Old Mr Pontifex then\r\ncame down more handsomely than was expected and settled \xc2\xa310,000 on his\r\nson and daughter-in-law for life with remainder to such of their issue\r\nas they might appoint. In the month of July, 1831 Theobald and\r\nChristina became man and wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nA due number of old shoes had been thrown at the carriage in which the\r\nhappy pair departed from the Rectory, and it had turned the corner at\r\nthe bottom of the village. It could then be seen for two or three\r\nhundred yards creeping past a fir coppice, and after this was lost to\r\nview.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Allaby to his man-servant, \xe2\x80\x9cshut the gate;\xe2\x80\x9d and he went\r\nindoors with a sigh of relief which seemed to say: \xe2\x80\x9cI have done it, and\r\nI am alive.\xe2\x80\x9d This was the reaction after a burst of enthusiastic\r\nmerriment during which the old gentleman had run twenty yards after the\r\ncarriage to fling a slipper at it\xe2\x80\x94which he had duly flung.\r\n\r\nBut what were the feelings of Theobald and Christina when the village\r\nwas passed and they were rolling quietly by the fir plantation? It is\r\nat this point that even the stoutest heart must fail, unless it beat in\r\nthe breast of one who is over head and ears in love. If a young man is\r\nin a small boat on a choppy sea, along with his affianced bride and\r\nboth are sea-sick, and if the sick swain can forget his own anguish in\r\nthe happiness of holding the fair one\xe2\x80\x99s head when she is at her\r\nworst\xe2\x80\x94then he is in love, and his heart will be in no danger of failing\r\nhim as he passes his fir plantation. Other people, and unfortunately by\r\nfar the greater number of those who get married must be classed among\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cother people,\xe2\x80\x9d will inevitably go through a quarter or half an\r\nhour of greater or less badness as the case may be. Taking numbers into\r\naccount, I should think more mental suffering had been undergone in the\r\nstreets leading from St George\xe2\x80\x99s, Hanover Square, than in the condemned\r\ncells of Newgate. There is no time at which what the Italians call _la\r\nfiglia della Morte_ lays her cold hand upon a man more awfully than\r\nduring the first half hour that he is alone with a woman whom he has\r\nmarried but never genuinely loved.\r\n\r\nDeath\xe2\x80\x99s daughter did not spare Theobald. He had behaved very well\r\nhitherto. When Christina had offered to let him go, he had stuck to his\r\npost with a magnanimity on which he had plumed himself ever since. From\r\nthat time forward he had said to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cI, at any rate, am the very\r\nsoul of honour; I am not,\xe2\x80\x9d etc., etc. True, at the moment of\r\nmagnanimity the actual cash payment, so to speak, was still distant;\r\nwhen his father gave formal consent to his marriage things began to\r\nlook more serious; when the college living had fallen vacant and been\r\naccepted they looked more serious still; but when Christina actually\r\nnamed the day, then Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s heart fainted within him.\r\n\r\nThe engagement had gone on so long that he had got into a groove, and\r\nthe prospect of change was disconcerting. Christina and he had got on,\r\nhe thought to himself, very nicely for a great number of years;\r\nwhy\xe2\x80\x94why\xe2\x80\x94why should they not continue to go on as they were doing now\r\nfor the rest of their lives? But there was no more chance of escape for\r\nhim than for the sheep which is being driven to the butcher\xe2\x80\x99s back\r\npremises, and like the sheep he felt that there was nothing to be\r\ngained by resistance, so he made none. He behaved, in fact, with\r\ndecency, and was declared on all hands to be one of the happiest men\r\nimaginable.\r\n\r\nNow, however, to change the metaphor, the drop had actually fallen, and\r\nthe poor wretch was hanging in mid air along with the creature of his\r\naffections. This creature was now thirty-three years old, and looked\r\nit: she had been weeping, and her eyes and nose were reddish; if \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave done it and I am alive,\xe2\x80\x9d was written on Mr Allaby\xe2\x80\x99s face after he\r\nhad thrown the shoe, \xe2\x80\x9cI have done it, and I do not see how I can\r\npossibly live much longer\xe2\x80\x9d was upon the face of Theobald as he was\r\nbeing driven along by the fir Plantation. This, however, was not\r\napparent at the Rectory. All that could be seen there was the bobbing\r\nup and down of the postilion\xe2\x80\x99s head, which just over-topped the hedge\r\nby the roadside as he rose in his stirrups, and the black and yellow\r\nbody of the carriage.\r\n\r\nFor some time the pair said nothing: what they must have felt during\r\ntheir first half hour, the reader must guess, for it is beyond my power\r\nto tell him; at the end of that time, however, Theobald had rummaged up\r\na conclusion from some odd corner of his soul to the effect that now he\r\nand Christina were married the sooner they fell into their future\r\nmutual relations the better. If people who are in a difficulty will\r\nonly do the first little reasonable thing which they can clearly\r\nrecognise as reasonable, they will always find the next step more easy\r\nboth to see and take. What, then, thought Theobald, was here at this\r\nmoment the first and most obvious matter to be considered, and what\r\nwould be an equitable view of his and Christina\xe2\x80\x99s relative positions in\r\nrespect to it? Clearly their first dinner was their first joint entry\r\ninto the duties and pleasures of married life. No less clearly it was\r\nChristina\xe2\x80\x99s duty to order it, and his own to eat it and pay for it.\r\n\r\nThe arguments leading to this conclusion, and the conclusion itself,\r\nflashed upon Theobald about three and a half miles after he had left\r\nCrampsford on the road to Newmarket. He had breakfasted early, but his\r\nusual appetite had failed him. They had left the vicarage at noon\r\nwithout staying for the wedding breakfast. Theobald liked an early\r\ndinner; it dawned upon him that he was beginning to be hungry; from\r\nthis to the conclusion stated in the preceding paragraph the steps had\r\nbeen easy. After a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 further reflection he broached the\r\nmatter to his bride, and thus the ice was broken.\r\n\r\nMrs Theobald was not prepared for so sudden an assumption of\r\nimportance. Her nerves, never of the strongest, had been strung to\r\ntheir highest tension by the event of the morning. She wanted to escape\r\nobservation; she was conscious of looking a little older than she quite\r\nliked to look as a bride who had been married that morning; she feared\r\nthe landlady, the chamber-maid, the waiter\xe2\x80\x94everybody and everything;\r\nher heart beat so fast that she could hardly speak, much less go\r\nthrough the ordeal of ordering dinner in a strange hotel with a strange\r\nlandlady. She begged and prayed to be let off. If Theobald would only\r\norder dinner this once, she would order it any day and every day in\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nBut the inexorable Theobald was not to be put off with such absurd\r\nexcuses. He was master now. Had not Christina less than two hours ago\r\npromised solemnly to honour and obey him, and was she turning restive\r\nover such a trifle as this? The loving smile departed from his face,\r\nand was succeeded by a scowl which that old Turk, his father, might\r\nhave envied. \xe2\x80\x9cStuff and nonsense, my dearest Christina,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed\r\nmildly, and stamped his foot upon the floor of the carriage. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s duty to order her husband\xe2\x80\x99s dinner; you are my wife, and I shall\r\nexpect you to order mine.\xe2\x80\x9d For Theobald was nothing if he was not\r\nlogical.\r\n\r\nThe bride began to cry, and said he was unkind; whereon he said\r\nnothing, but revolved unutterable things in his heart. Was this, then,\r\nthe end of his six years of unflagging devotion? Was it for this that\r\nwhen Christina had offered to let him off, he had stuck to his\r\nengagement? Was this the outcome of her talks about duty and spiritual\r\nmindedness\xe2\x80\x94that now upon the very day of her marriage she should fail\r\nto see that the first step in obedience to God lay in obedience to\r\nhimself? He would drive back to Crampsford; he would complain to Mr and\r\nMrs Allaby; he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to have married Christina; he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t married\r\nher; it was all a hideous dream; he would\xe2\x80\x94But a voice kept ringing in\r\nhis ears which said: \xe2\x80\x9cYOU CAN\xe2\x80\x99T, CAN\xe2\x80\x99T, CAN\xe2\x80\x99T.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCAN\xe2\x80\x99T I?\xe2\x80\x9d screamed the unhappy creature to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the remorseless voice, \xe2\x80\x9cYOU CAN\xe2\x80\x99T. YOU ARE A MARRIED MAN.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rolled back in his corner of the carriage and for the first time\r\nfelt how iniquitous were the marriage laws of England. But he would buy\r\nMilton\xe2\x80\x99s prose works and read his pamphlet on divorce. He might perhaps\r\nbe able to get them at Newmarket.\r\n\r\nSo the bride sat crying in one corner of the carriage; and the\r\nbridegroom sulked in the other, and he feared her as only a bridegroom\r\ncan fear.\r\n\r\nPresently, however, a feeble voice was heard from the bride\xe2\x80\x99s corner\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest Theobald\xe2\x80\x94dearest Theobald, forgive me; I have been very, very\r\nwrong. Please do not be angry with me. I will order the\xe2\x80\x94the\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d but the\r\nword \xe2\x80\x9cdinner\xe2\x80\x9d was checked by rising sobs.\r\n\r\nWhen Theobald heard these words a load began to be lifted from his\r\nheart, but he only looked towards her, and that not too pleasantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the voice, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat you think you would like,\r\nand I will tell the landlady when we get to Newmar\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d but another burst\r\nof sobs checked the completion of the word.\r\n\r\nThe load on Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s heart grew lighter and lighter. Was it possible\r\nthat she might not be going to henpeck him after all? Besides, had she\r\nnot diverted his attention from herself to his approaching dinner?\r\n\r\nHe swallowed down more of his apprehensions and said, but still\r\ngloomily, \xe2\x80\x9cI think we might have a roast fowl with bread sauce, new\r\npotatoes and green peas, and then we will see if they could let us have\r\na cherry tart and some cream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes more he drew her towards him, kissed away her\r\ntears, and assured her that he knew she would be a good wife to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest Theobald,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed in answer, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are an angel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheobald believed her, and in ten minutes more the happy couple\r\nalighted at the inn at Newmarket.\r\n\r\nBravely did Christina go through her arduous task. Eagerly did she\r\nbeseech the landlady, in secret, not to keep her Theobald waiting\r\nlonger than was absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have any soup ready, you know, Mrs Barber, it might save ten\r\nminutes, for we might have it while the fowl was browning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSee how necessity had nerved her! But in truth she had a splitting\r\nheadache, and would have given anything to have been alone.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was a success. A pint of sherry had warmed Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s heart,\r\nand he began to hope that, after all, matters might still go well with\r\nhim. He had conquered in the first battle, and this gives great\r\nprestige. How easy it had been too! Why had he never treated his\r\nsisters in this way? He would do so next time he saw them; he might in\r\ntime be able to stand up to his brother John, or even his father. Thus\r\ndo we build castles in air when flushed with wine and conquest.\r\n\r\nThe end of the honeymoon saw Mrs Theobald the most devotedly obsequious\r\nwife in all England. According to the old saying, Theobald had killed\r\nthe cat at the beginning. It had been a very little cat, a mere kitten\r\nin fact, or he might have been afraid to face it, but such as it had\r\nbeen he had challenged it to mortal combat, and had held up its\r\ndripping head defiantly before his wife\xe2\x80\x99s face. The rest had been easy.\r\n\r\nStrange that one whom I have described hitherto as so timid and easily\r\nput upon should prove such a Tartar all of a sudden on the day of his\r\nmarriage. Perhaps I have passed over his years of courtship too\r\nrapidly. During these he had become a tutor of his college, and had at\r\nlast been Junior Dean. I never yet knew a man whose sense of his own\r\nimportance did not become adequately developed after he had held a\r\nresident fellowship for five or six years. True\xe2\x80\x94immediately on arriving\r\nwithin a ten mile radius of his father\xe2\x80\x99s house, an enchantment fell\r\nupon him, so that his knees waxed weak, his greatness departed, and he\r\nagain felt himself like an overgrown baby under a perpetual cloud; but\r\nthen he was not often at Elmhurst, and as soon as he left it the spell\r\nwas taken off again; once more he became the fellow and tutor of his\r\ncollege, the Junior Dean, the betrothed of Christina, the idol of the\r\nAllaby womankind. From all which it may be gathered that if Christina\r\nhad been a Barbary hen, and had ruffled her feathers in any show of\r\nresistance Theobald would not have ventured to swagger with her, but\r\nshe was not a Barbary hen, she was only a common hen, and that too with\r\nrather a smaller share of personal bravery than hens generally have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nBattersby-On-The-Hill was the name of the village of which Theobald was\r\nnow Rector. It contained 400 or 500 inhabitants, scattered over a\r\nrather large area, and consisting entirely of farmers and agricultural\r\nlabourers. The Rectory was commodious, and placed on the brow of a hill\r\nwhich gave it a delightful prospect. There was a fair sprinkling of\r\nneighbours within visiting range, but with one or two exceptions they\r\nwere the clergymen and clergymen\xe2\x80\x99s families of the surrounding\r\nvillages.\r\n\r\nBy these the Pontifexes were welcomed as great acquisitions to the\r\nneighbourhood. Mr Pontifex, they said was so clever; he had been senior\r\nclassic and senior wrangler; a perfect genius in fact, and yet with so\r\nmuch sound practical common sense as well. As son of such a\r\ndistinguished man as the great Mr Pontifex the publisher he would come\r\ninto a large property by-and-by. Was there not an elder brother? Yes,\r\nbut there would be so much that Theobald would probably get something\r\nvery considerable. Of course they would give dinner parties. And Mrs\r\nPontifex, what a charming woman she was; she was certainly not exactly\r\npretty perhaps, but then she had such a sweet smile and her manner was\r\nso bright and winning. She was so devoted too to her husband and her\r\nhusband to her; they really did come up to one\xe2\x80\x99s ideas of what lovers\r\nused to be in days of old; it was rare to meet with such a pair in\r\nthese degenerate times; it was quite beautiful, etc., etc. Such were\r\nthe comments of the neighbours on the new arrivals.\r\n\r\nAs for Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s own parishioners, the farmers were civil and the\r\nlabourers and their wives obsequious. There was a little dissent, the\r\nlegacy of a careless predecessor, but as Mrs Theobald said proudly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink Theobald may be trusted to deal with _that_.\xe2\x80\x9d The church was then\r\nan interesting specimen of late Norman, with some early English\r\nadditions. It was what in these days would be called in a very bad\r\nstate of repair, but forty or fifty years ago few churches were in good\r\nrepair. If there is one feature more characteristic of the present\r\ngeneration than another it is that it has been a great restorer of\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\nHorace preached church restoration in his ode:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nDelicta majorum immeritus lues,\r\nRomane, donec templa refeceris\r\n    Aedesque labentes deorum et\r\n        Foeda nigro simulacra fumo.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing went right with Rome for long together after the Augustan age,\r\nbut whether it was because she did restore the temples or because she\r\ndid not restore them I know not. They certainly went all wrong after\r\nConstantine\xe2\x80\x99s time and yet Rome is still a city of some importance.\r\n\r\nI may say here that before Theobald had been many years at Battersby he\r\nfound scope for useful work in the rebuilding of Battersby church,\r\nwhich he carried out at considerable cost, towards which he subscribed\r\nliberally himself. He was his own architect, and this saved expense;\r\nbut architecture was not very well understood about the year 1834, when\r\nTheobald commenced operations, and the result is not as satisfactory as\r\nit would have been if he had waited a few years longer.\r\n\r\nEvery man\xe2\x80\x99s work, whether it be literature or music or pictures or\r\narchitecture or anything else, is always a portrait of himself, and the\r\nmore he tries to conceal himself the more clearly will his character\r\nappear in spite of him. I may very likely be condemning myself, all the\r\ntime that I am writing this book, for I know that whether I like it or\r\nno I am portraying myself more surely than I am portraying any of the\r\ncharacters whom I set before the reader. I am sorry that it is so, but\r\nI cannot help it\xe2\x80\x94after which sop to Nemesis I will say that Battersby\r\nchurch in its amended form has always struck me as a better portrait of\r\nTheobald than any sculptor or painter short of a great master would be\r\nable to produce.\r\n\r\nI remember staying with Theobald some six or seven months after he was\r\nmarried, and while the old church was still standing. I went to church,\r\nand felt as Naaman must have felt on certain occasions when he had to\r\naccompany his master on his return after having been cured of his\r\nleprosy. I have carried away a more vivid recollection of this and of\r\nthe people, than of Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s sermon. Even now I can see the men in\r\nblue smock frocks reaching to their heels, and more than one old woman\r\nin a scarlet cloak; the row of stolid, dull, vacant plough-boys,\r\nungainly in build, uncomely in face, lifeless, apathetic, a race a good\r\ndeal more like the pre-revolution French peasant as described by\r\nCarlyle than is pleasant to reflect upon\xe2\x80\x94a race now supplanted by a\r\nsmarter, comelier and more hopeful generation, which has discovered\r\nthat it too has a right to as much happiness as it can get, and with\r\nclearer ideas about the best means of getting it.\r\n\r\nThey shamble in one after another, with steaming breath, for it is\r\nwinter, and loud clattering of hob-nailed boots; they beat the snow\r\nfrom off them as they enter, and through the opened door I catch a\r\nmomentary glimpse of a dreary leaden sky and snow-clad tombstones.\r\nSomehow or other I find the strain which Handel has wedded to the words\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere the ploughman near at hand,\xe2\x80\x9d has got into my head and there is\r\nno getting it out again. How marvellously old Handel understood these\r\npeople!\r\n\r\nThey bob to Theobald as they passed the reading desk (\xe2\x80\x9cThe people\r\nhereabouts are truly respectful,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Christina to me, \xe2\x80\x9cthey know\r\ntheir betters.\xe2\x80\x9d), and take their seats in a long row against the wall.\r\nThe choir clamber up into the gallery with their instruments\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nvioloncello, a clarinet and a trombone. I see them and soon I hear\r\nthem, for there is a hymn before the service, a wild strain, a remnant,\r\nif I mistake not, of some pre-Reformation litany. I have heard what I\r\nbelieve was its remote musical progenitor in the church of SS. Giovanni\r\ne Paolo at Venice not five years since; and again I have heard it far\r\naway in mid-Atlantic upon a grey sea-Sabbath in June, when neither\r\nwinds nor waves are stirring, so that the emigrants gather on deck, and\r\ntheir plaintive psalm goes forth upon the silver haze of the sky, and\r\non the wilderness of a sea that has sighed till it can sigh no longer.\r\nOr it may be heard at some Methodist Camp Meeting upon a Welsh\r\nhillside, but in the churches it is gone for ever. If I were a musician\r\nI would take it as the subject for the _adagio_ in a Wesleyan symphony.\r\n\r\nGone now are the clarinet, the violoncello and the trombone, wild\r\nminstrelsy as of the doleful creatures in Ezekiel, discordant, but\r\ninfinitely pathetic. Gone is that scarebabe stentor, that bellowing\r\nbull of Bashan the village blacksmith, gone is the melodious carpenter,\r\ngone the brawny shepherd with the red hair, who roared more lustily\r\nthan all, until they came to the words, \xe2\x80\x9cShepherds with your flocks\r\nabiding,\xe2\x80\x9d when modesty covered him with confusion, and compelled him to\r\nbe silent, as though his own health were being drunk. They were doomed\r\nand had a presentiment of evil, even when first I saw them, but they\r\nhad still a little lease of choir life remaining, and they roared out\r\n\r\n[Illustration] wick-ed hands have pierced and nailed him, pierced and\r\nnailed him to a tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nbut no description can give a proper idea of the effect. When I was\r\nlast in Battersby church there was a harmonium played by a\r\nsweet-looking girl with a choir of school children around her, and they\r\nchanted the canticles to the most correct of chants, and they sang\r\nHymns Ancient and Modern; the high pews were gone, nay, the very\r\ngallery in which the old choir had sung was removed as an accursed\r\nthing which might remind the people of the high places, and Theobald\r\nwas old, and Christina was lying under the yew trees in the churchyard.\r\n\r\nBut in the evening later on I saw three very old men come chuckling out\r\nof a dissenting chapel, and surely enough they were my old friends the\r\nblacksmith, the carpenter and the shepherd. There was a look of content\r\nupon their faces which made me feel certain they had been singing; not\r\ndoubtless with the old glory of the violoncello, the clarinet and the\r\ntrombone, but still songs of Sion and no new fangled papistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hymn had engaged my attention; when it was over I had time to take\r\nstock of the congregation. They were chiefly farmers\xe2\x80\x94fat, very\r\nwell-to-do folk, who had come some of them with their wives and\r\nchildren from outlying farms two and three miles away; haters of popery\r\nand of anything which any one might choose to say was popish; good,\r\nsensible fellows who detested theory of any kind, whose ideal was the\r\nmaintenance of the _status quo_ with perhaps a loving reminiscence of\r\nold war times, and a sense of wrong that the weather was not more\r\ncompletely under their control, who desired higher prices and cheaper\r\nwages, but otherwise were most contented when things were changing\r\nleast; tolerators, if not lovers, of all that was familiar, haters of\r\nall that was unfamiliar; they would have been equally horrified at\r\nhearing the Christian religion doubted, and at seeing it practised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can there be in common between Theobald and his parishioners?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Christina to me, in the course of the evening, when her husband\r\nwas for a few moments absent. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course one must not complain, but I\r\nassure you it grieves me to see a man of Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s ability thrown away\r\nupon such a place as this. If we had only been at Gaysbury, where there\r\nare the A\xe2\x80\x99s, the B\xe2\x80\x99s, the C\xe2\x80\x99s, and Lord D\xe2\x80\x99s place, as you know, quite\r\nclose, I should not then have felt that we were living in such a\r\ndesert; but I suppose it is for the best,\xe2\x80\x9d she added more cheerfully;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand then of course the Bishop will come to us whenever he is in the\r\nneighbourhood, and if we were at Gaysbury he might have gone to Lord\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerhaps I have now said enough to indicate the kind of place in which\r\nTheobald\xe2\x80\x99s lines were cast, and the sort of woman he had married. As\r\nfor his own habits, I see him trudging through muddy lanes and over\r\nlong sweeps of plover-haunted pastures to visit a dying cottager\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife. He takes her meat and wine from his own table, and that not a\r\nlittle only but liberally. According to his lights also, he administers\r\nwhat he is pleased to call spiritual consolation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I\xe2\x80\x99m going to Hell, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says the sick woman with a whine.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Sir, save me, save me, don\xe2\x80\x99t let me go there. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand it,\r\nSir, I should die with fear, the very thought of it drives me into a\r\ncold sweat all over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Thompson,\xe2\x80\x9d says Theobald gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must have faith in the\r\nprecious blood of your Redeemer; it is He alone who can save you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut are you sure, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, looking wistfully at him, \xe2\x80\x9cthat He\r\nwill forgive me\xe2\x80\x94for I\xe2\x80\x99ve not been a very good woman, indeed I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94and if God would only say \xe2\x80\x98Yes\xe2\x80\x99 outright with His mouth when I\r\nask whether my sins are forgiven me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they _are_ forgiven you, Mrs Thompson,\xe2\x80\x9d says Theobald with some\r\nsternness, for the same ground has been gone over a good many times\r\nalready, and he has borne the unhappy woman\xe2\x80\x99s misgivings now for a full\r\nquarter of an hour. Then he puts a stop to the conversation by\r\nrepeating prayers taken from the \xe2\x80\x9cVisitation of the Sick,\xe2\x80\x9d and overawes\r\nthe poor wretch from expressing further anxiety as to her condition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaims piteously, as she sees that he\r\nis preparing to go away, \xe2\x80\x9ccan\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me that there is no Day of\r\nJudgement, and that there is no such place as Hell? I can do without\r\nthe Heaven, Sir, but I cannot do with the Hell.\xe2\x80\x9d Theobald is much\r\nshocked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Thompson,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoins impressively, \xe2\x80\x9clet me implore you to suffer\r\nno doubt concerning these two cornerstones of our religion to cross\r\nyour mind at a moment like the present. If there is one thing more\r\ncertain than another it is that we shall all appear before the\r\nJudgement Seat of Christ, and that the wicked will be consumed in a\r\nlake of everlasting fire. Doubt this, Mrs Thompson, and you are lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor woman buries her fevered head in the coverlet in a paroxysm of\r\nfear which at last finds relief in tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Thompson,\xe2\x80\x9d says Theobald, with his hand on the door, \xe2\x80\x9ccompose\r\nyourself, be calm; you must please to take my word for it that at the\r\nDay of Judgement your sins will be all washed white in the blood of the\r\nLamb, Mrs Thompson. Yea,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaims frantically, \xe2\x80\x9cthough they be as\r\nscarlet, yet shall they be as white as wool,\xe2\x80\x9d and he makes off as fast\r\nas he can from the fetid atmosphere of the cottage to the pure air\r\noutside. Oh, how thankful he is when the interview is over!\r\n\r\nHe returns home, conscious that he has done his duty, and administered\r\nthe comforts of religion to a dying sinner. His admiring wife awaits\r\nhim at the Rectory, and assures him that never yet was clergyman so\r\ndevoted to the welfare of his flock. He believes her; he has a natural\r\ntendency to believe everything that is told him, and who should know\r\nthe facts of the case better than his wife? Poor fellow! He has done\r\nhis best, but what does a fish\xe2\x80\x99s best come to when the fish is out of\r\nwater? He has left meat and wine\xe2\x80\x94that he can do; he will call again and\r\nwill leave more meat and wine; day after day he trudges over the same\r\nplover-haunted fields, and listens at the end of his walk to the same\r\nagony of forebodings, which day after day he silences, but does not\r\nremove, till at last a merciful weakness renders the sufferer careless\r\nof her future, and Theobald is satisfied that her mind is now\r\npeacefully at rest in Jesus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nHe does not like this branch of his profession\xe2\x80\x94indeed he hates it\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nwill not admit it to himself. The habit of not admitting things to\r\nhimself has become a confirmed one with him. Nevertheless there haunts\r\nhim an ill defined sense that life would be pleasanter if there were no\r\nsick sinners, or if they would at any rate face an eternity of torture\r\nwith more indifference. He does not feel that he is in his element. The\r\nfarmers look as if they were in their element. They are full-bodied,\r\nhealthy and contented; but between him and them there is a great gulf\r\nfixed. A hard and drawn look begins to settle about the corners of his\r\nmouth, so that even if he were not in a black coat and white tie a\r\nchild might know him for a parson.\r\n\r\nHe knows that he is doing his duty. Every day convinces him of this\r\nmore firmly; but then there is not much duty for him to do. He is sadly\r\nin want of occupation. He has no taste for any of those field sports\r\nwhich were not considered unbecoming for a clergyman forty years ago.\r\nHe does not ride, nor shoot, nor fish, nor course, nor play cricket.\r\nStudy, to do him justice, he had never really liked, and what\r\ninducement was there for him to study at Battersby? He reads neither\r\nold books nor new ones. He does not interest himself in art or science\r\nor politics, but he sets his back up with some promptness if any of\r\nthem show any development unfamiliar to himself. True, he writes his\r\nown sermons, but even his wife considers that his _forte_ lies rather\r\nin the example of his life (which is one long act of self-devotion)\r\nthan in his utterances from the pulpit. After breakfast he retires to\r\nhis study; he cuts little bits out of the Bible and gums them with\r\nexquisite neatness by the side of other little bits; this he calls\r\nmaking a Harmony of the Old and New Testaments. Alongside the extracts\r\nhe copies in the very perfection of hand-writing extracts from Mede\r\n(the only man, according to Theobald, who really understood the Book of\r\nRevelation), Patrick, and other old divines. He works steadily at this\r\nfor half an hour every morning during many years, and the result is\r\ndoubtless valuable. After some years have gone by he hears his children\r\ntheir lessons, and the daily oft-repeated screams that issue from the\r\nstudy during the lesson hours tell their own horrible story over the\r\nhouse. He has also taken to collecting a _hortus siccus_, and through\r\nthe interest of his father was once mentioned in the Saturday Magazine\r\nas having been the first to find a plant, whose name I have forgotten,\r\nin the neighbourhood of Battersby. This number of the Saturday Magazine\r\nhas been bound in red morocco, and is kept upon the drawing-room table.\r\nHe potters about his garden; if he hears a hen cackling he runs and\r\ntells Christina, and straightway goes hunting for the egg.\r\n\r\nWhen the two Miss Allabys came, as they sometimes did, to stay with\r\nChristina, they said the life led by their sister and brother-in-law\r\nwas an idyll. Happy indeed was Christina in her choice, for that she\r\nhad had a choice was a fiction which soon took root among them\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nhappy Theobald in his Christina. Somehow or other Christina was always\r\na little shy of cards when her sisters were staying with her, though at\r\nother times she enjoyed a game of cribbage or a rubber of whist\r\nheartily enough, but her sisters knew they would never be asked to\r\nBattersby again if they were to refer to that little matter, and on the\r\nwhole it was worth their while to be asked to Battersby. If Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntemper was rather irritable he did not vent it upon them.\r\n\r\nBy nature reserved, if he could have found someone to cook his dinner\r\nfor him, he would rather have lived in a desert island than not. In his\r\nheart of hearts he held with Pope that \xe2\x80\x9cthe greatest nuisance to\r\nmankind is man\xe2\x80\x9d or words to that effect\xe2\x80\x94only that women, with the\r\nexception perhaps of Christina, were worse. Yet for all this when\r\nvisitors called he put a better face on it than anyone who was behind\r\nthe scenes would have expected.\r\n\r\nHe was quick too at introducing the names of any literary celebrities\r\nwhom he had met at his father\xe2\x80\x99s house, and soon established an\r\nall-round reputation which satisfied even Christina herself.\r\n\r\nWho so _integer vit\xc3\xa6 scelerisque purus_, it was asked, as Mr Pontifex\r\nof Battersby? Who so fit to be consulted if any difficulty about parish\r\nmanagement should arise? Who such a happy mixture of the sincere\r\nuninquiring Christian and of the man of the world? For so people\r\nactually called him. They said he was such an admirable man of\r\nbusiness. Certainly if he had said he would pay a sum of money at a\r\ncertain time, the money would be forthcoming on the appointed day, and\r\nthis is saying a good deal for any man. His constitutional timidity\r\nrendered him incapable of an attempt to overreach when there was the\r\nremotest chance of opposition or publicity, and his correct bearing and\r\nsomewhat stern expression were a great protection to him against being\r\noverreached. He never talked of money, and invariably changed the\r\nsubject whenever money was introduced. His expression of unutterable\r\nhorror at all kinds of meanness was a sufficient guarantee that he was\r\nnot mean himself. Besides he had no business transactions save of the\r\nmost ordinary butcher\xe2\x80\x99s book and baker\xe2\x80\x99s book description. His\r\ntastes\xe2\x80\x94if he had any\xe2\x80\x94were, as we have seen, simple; he had \xc2\xa3900 a year\r\nand a house; the neighbourhood was cheap, and for some time he had no\r\nchildren to be a drag upon him. Who was not to be envied, and if envied\r\nwhy then respected, if Theobald was not enviable?\r\n\r\nYet I imagine that Christina was on the whole happier than her husband.\r\nShe had not to go and visit sick parishioners, and the management of\r\nher house and the keeping of her accounts afforded as much occupation\r\nas she desired. Her principal duty was, as she well said, to her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x94to love him, honour him, and keep him in a good temper. To do\r\nher justice she fulfilled this duty to the uttermost of her power. It\r\nwould have been better perhaps if she had not so frequently assured her\r\nhusband that he was the best and wisest of mankind, for no one in his\r\nlittle world ever dreamed of telling him anything else, and it was not\r\nlong before he ceased to have any doubt upon the matter. As for his\r\ntemper, which had become very violent at times, she took care to humour\r\nit on the slightest sign of an approaching outbreak. She had early\r\nfound that this was much the easiest plan. The thunder was seldom for\r\nherself. Long before her marriage even she had studied his little ways,\r\nand knew how to add fuel to the fire as long as the fire seemed to want\r\nit, and then to damp it judiciously down, making as little smoke as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nIn money matters she was scrupulousness itself. Theobald made her a\r\nquarterly allowance for her dress, pocket money and little charities\r\nand presents. In these last items she was liberal in proportion to her\r\nincome; indeed she dressed with great economy and gave away whatever\r\nwas over in presents or charity. Oh, what a comfort it was to Theobald\r\nto reflect that he had a wife on whom he could rely never to cost him a\r\nsixpence of unauthorised expenditure! Letting alone her absolute\r\nsubmission, the perfect coincidence of her opinion with his own upon\r\nevery subject and her constant assurances to him that he was right in\r\neverything which he took it into his head to say or do, what a tower of\r\nstrength to him was her exactness in money matters! As years went by he\r\nbecame as fond of his wife as it was in his nature to be of any living\r\nthing, and applauded himself for having stuck to his engagement\xe2\x80\x94a piece\r\nof virtue of which he was now reaping the reward. Even when Christina\r\ndid outrun her quarterly stipend by some thirty shillings or a couple\r\nof pounds, it was always made perfectly clear to Theobald how the\r\ndeficiency had arisen\xe2\x80\x94there had been an unusually costly evening dress\r\nbought which was to last a long time, or somebody\xe2\x80\x99s unexpected wedding\r\nhad necessitated a more handsome present than the quarter\xe2\x80\x99s balance\r\nwould quite allow: the excess of expenditure was always repaid in the\r\nfollowing quarter or quarters even though it were only ten shillings at\r\na time.\r\n\r\nI believe, however, that after they had been married some twenty years,\r\nChristina had somewhat fallen from her original perfection as regards\r\nmoney. She had got gradually in arrear during many successive quarters,\r\ntill she had contracted a chronic loan a sort of domestic national\r\ndebt, amounting to between seven and eight pounds. Theobald at length\r\nfelt that a remonstrance had become imperative, and took advantage of\r\nhis silver wedding day to inform Christina that her indebtedness was\r\ncancelled, and at the same time to beg that she would endeavour\r\nhenceforth to equalise her expenditure and her income. She burst into\r\ntears of love and gratitude, assured him that he was the best and most\r\ngenerous of men, and never during the remainder of her married life was\r\nshe a single shilling behind hand.\r\n\r\nChristina hated change of all sorts no less cordially than her husband.\r\nShe and Theobald had nearly everything in this world that they could\r\nwish for; why, then, should people desire to introduce all sorts of\r\nchanges of which no one could foresee the end? Religion, she was deeply\r\nconvinced, had long since attained its final development, nor could it\r\nenter into the heart of reasonable man to conceive any faith more\r\nperfect than was inculcated by the Church of England. She could imagine\r\nno position more honourable than that of a clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s wife unless\r\nindeed it were a bishop\xe2\x80\x99s. Considering his father\xe2\x80\x99s influence it was\r\nnot at all impossible that Theobald might be a bishop some day\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94then would occur to her that one little flaw in the practice of\r\nthe Church of England\xe2\x80\x94a flaw not indeed in its doctrine, but in its\r\npolicy, which she believed on the whole to be a mistaken one in this\r\nrespect. I mean the fact that a bishop\xe2\x80\x99s wife does not take the rank of\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\nThis had been the doing of Elizabeth, who had been a bad woman, of\r\nexceeding doubtful moral character, and at heart a Papist to the last.\r\nPerhaps people ought to have been above mere considerations of worldly\r\ndignity, but the world was as it was, and such things carried weight\r\nwith them, whether they ought to do so or no. Her influence as plain\r\nMrs Pontifex, wife, we will say, of the Bishop of Winchester, would no\r\ndoubt be considerable. Such a character as hers could not fail to carry\r\nweight if she were ever in a sufficiently conspicuous sphere for its\r\ninfluence to be widely felt; but as Lady Winchester\xe2\x80\x94or the\r\nBishopess\xe2\x80\x94which would sound quite nicely\xe2\x80\x94who could doubt that her power\r\nfor good would be enhanced? And it would be all the nicer because if\r\nshe had a daughter the daughter would not be a Bishopess unless indeed\r\nshe were to marry a Bishop too, which would not be likely.\r\n\r\nThese were her thoughts upon her good days; at other times she would,\r\nto do her justice, have doubts whether she was in all respects as\r\nspiritually minded as she ought to be. She must press on, press on,\r\ntill every enemy to her salvation was surmounted and Satan himself lay\r\nbruised under her feet. It occurred to her on one of these occasions\r\nthat she might steal a march over some of her contemporaries if she\r\nwere to leave off eating black puddings, of which whenever they had\r\nkilled a pig she had hitherto partaken freely; and if she were also\r\ncareful that no fowls were served at her table which had had their\r\nnecks wrung, but only such as had had their throats cut and been\r\nallowed to bleed. St Paul and the Church of Jerusalem had insisted upon\r\nit as necessary that even Gentile converts should abstain from things\r\nstrangled and from blood, and they had joined this prohibition with\r\nthat of a vice about the abominable nature of which there could be no\r\nquestion; it would be well therefore to abstain in future and see\r\nwhether any noteworthy spiritual result ensued. She did abstain, and\r\nwas certain that from the day of her resolve she had felt stronger,\r\npurer in heart, and in all respects more spiritually minded than she\r\nhad ever felt hitherto. Theobald did not lay so much stress on this as\r\nshe did, but as she settled what he should have at dinner she could\r\ntake care that he got no strangled fowls; as for black puddings,\r\nhappily, he had seen them made when he was a boy, and had never got\r\nover his aversion for them. She wished the matter were one of more\r\ngeneral observance than it was; this was just a case in which as Lady\r\nWinchester she might have been able to do what as plain Mrs Pontifex it\r\nwas hopeless even to attempt.\r\n\r\nAnd thus this worthy couple jogged on from month to month and from year\r\nto year. The reader, if he has passed middle life and has a clerical\r\nconnection, will probably remember scores and scores of rectors and\r\nrectors\xe2\x80\x99 wives who differed in no material respect from Theobald and\r\nChristina. Speaking from a recollection and experience extending over\r\nnearly eighty years from the time when I was myself a child in the\r\nnursery of a vicarage, I should say I had drawn the better rather than\r\nthe worse side of the life of an English country parson of some fifty\r\nyears ago. I admit, however, that there are no such people to be found\r\nnowadays. A more united or, on the whole, happier, couple could not\r\nhave been found in England. One grief only overshadowed the early years\r\nof their married life: I mean the fact that no living children were\r\nborn to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of time this sorrow was removed. At the beginning of the\r\nfifth year of her married life Christina was safely delivered of a boy.\r\nThis was on the sixth of September 1835.\r\n\r\nWord was immediately sent to old Mr Pontifex, who received the news\r\nwith real pleasure. His son John\xe2\x80\x99s wife had borne daughters only, and\r\nhe was seriously uneasy lest there should be a failure in the male line\r\nof his descendants. The good news, therefore, was doubly welcome, and\r\ncaused as much delight at Elmhurst as dismay in Woburn Square, where\r\nthe John Pontifexes were then living.\r\n\r\nHere, indeed, this freak of fortune was felt to be all the more cruel\r\non account of the impossibility of resenting it openly; but the\r\ndelighted grandfather cared nothing for what the John Pontifexes might\r\nfeel or not feel; he had wanted a grandson and he had got a grandson,\r\nand this should be enough for everybody; and, now that Mrs Theobald had\r\ntaken to good ways, she might bring him more grandsons, which would be\r\ndesirable, for he should not feel safe with fewer than three.\r\n\r\nHe rang the bell for the butler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGelstrap,\xe2\x80\x9d he said solemnly, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to go down into the cellar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Gelstrap preceded him with a candle, and he went into the inner\r\nvault where he kept his choicest wines.\r\n\r\nHe passed many bins: there was 1803 Port, 1792 Imperial Tokay, 1800\r\nClaret, 1812 Sherry, these and many others were passed, but it was not\r\nfor them that the head of the Pontifex family had gone down into his\r\ninner cellar. A bin, which had appeared empty until the full light of\r\nthe candle had been brought to bear upon it, was now found to contain a\r\nsingle pint bottle. This was the object of Mr Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s search.\r\n\r\nGelstrap had often pondered over this bottle. It had been placed there\r\nby Mr Pontifex himself about a dozen years previously, on his return\r\nfrom a visit to his friend the celebrated traveller Dr Jones\xe2\x80\x94but there\r\nwas no tablet above the bin which might give a clue to the nature of\r\nits contents. On more than one occasion when his master had gone out\r\nand left his keys accidentally behind him, as he sometimes did,\r\nGelstrap had submitted the bottle to all the tests he could venture\r\nupon, but it was so carefully sealed that wisdom remained quite shut\r\nout from that entrance at which he would have welcomed her most\r\ngladly\xe2\x80\x94and indeed from all other entrances, for he could make out\r\nnothing at all.\r\n\r\nAnd now the mystery was to be solved. But alas! it seemed as though the\r\nlast chance of securing even a sip of the contents was to be removed\r\nfor ever, for Mr Pontifex took the bottle into his own hands and held\r\nit up to the light after carefully examining the seal. He smiled and\r\nleft the bin with the bottle in his hands.\r\n\r\nThen came a catastrophe. He stumbled over an empty hamper; there was\r\nthe sound of a fall\xe2\x80\x94a smash of broken glass, and in an instant the\r\ncellar floor was covered with the liquid that had been preserved so\r\ncarefully for so many years.\r\n\r\nWith his usual presence of mind Mr Pontifex gasped out a month\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwarning to Gelstrap. Then he got up, and stamped as Theobald had done\r\nwhen Christina had wanted not to order his dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s water from the Jordan,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed furiously, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich I have\r\nbeen saving for the baptism of my eldest grandson. Damn you, Gelstrap,\r\nhow dare you be so infernally careless as to leave that hamper\r\nlittering about the cellar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI wonder the water of the sacred stream did not stand upright as an\r\nheap upon the cellar floor and rebuke him. Gelstrap told the other\r\nservants afterwards that his master\xe2\x80\x99s language had made his backbone\r\ncurdle.\r\n\r\nThe moment, however, that he heard the word \xe2\x80\x9cwater,\xe2\x80\x9d he saw his way\r\nagain, and flew to the pantry. Before his master had well noted his\r\nabsence he returned with a little sponge and a basin, and had begun\r\nsopping up the waters of the Jordan as though they had been a common\r\nslop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll filter it, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gelstrap meekly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll come quite clean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Pontifex saw hope in this suggestion, which was shortly carried out\r\nby the help of a piece of blotting paper and a funnel, under his own\r\neyes. Eventually it was found that half a pint was saved, and this was\r\nheld to be sufficient.\r\n\r\nThen he made preparations for a visit to Battersby. He ordered goodly\r\nhampers of the choicest eatables, he selected a goodly hamper of choice\r\ndrinkables. I say choice and not choicest, for although in his first\r\nexaltation he had selected some of his very best wine, yet on\r\nreflection he had felt that there was moderation in all things, and as\r\nhe was parting with his best water from the Jordan, he would only send\r\nsome of his second best wine.\r\n\r\nBefore he went to Battersby he stayed a day or two in London, which he\r\nnow seldom did, being over seventy years old, and having practically\r\nretired from business. The John Pontifexes, who kept a sharp eye on\r\nhim, discovered to their dismay that he had had an interview with his\r\nsolicitors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the first time in his life Theobald felt that he had done something\r\nright, and could look forward to meeting his father without alarm. The\r\nold gentleman, indeed, had written him a most cordial letter,\r\nannouncing his intention of standing godfather to the boy\xe2\x80\x94nay, I may as\r\nwell give it in full, as it shows the writer at his best. It runs:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Theobald,\xe2\x80\x94Your letter gave me very sincere pleasure, the more so\r\nbecause I had made up my mind for the worst; pray accept my most hearty\r\ncongratulations for my daughter-in-law and for yourself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have long preserved a phial of water from the Jordan for the\r\nchristening of my first grandson, should it please God to grant me one.\r\nIt was given me by my old friend Dr Jones. You will agree with me that\r\nthough the efficacy of the sacrament does not depend upon the source of\r\nthe baptismal waters, yet, _ceteris paribus_, there is a sentiment\r\nattaching to the waters of the Jordan which should not be despised.\r\nSmall matters like this sometimes influence a child\xe2\x80\x99s whole future\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall bring my own cook, and have told him to get everything ready\r\nfor the christening dinner. Ask as many of your best neighbours as your\r\ntable will hold. By the way, I have told Lesueur _not to get a\r\nlobster_\xe2\x80\x94you had better drive over yourself and get one from Saltness\r\n(for Battersby was only fourteen or fifteen miles from the sea coast);\r\nthey are better there, at least I think so, than anywhere else in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have put your boy down for something in the event of his attaining\r\nthe age of twenty-one years. If your brother John continues to have\r\nnothing but girls I may do more later on, but I have many claims upon\r\nme, and am not as well off as you may imagine.\xe2\x80\x94Your affectionate\r\nfather,\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cG. PONTIFEX.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards the writer of the above letter made his\r\nappearance in a fly which had brought him from Gildenham to Battersby,\r\na distance of fourteen miles. There was Lesueur, the cook, on the box\r\nwith the driver, and as many hampers as the fly could carry were\r\ndisposed upon the roof and elsewhere. Next day the John Pontifexes had\r\nto come, and Eliza and Maria, as well as Alethea, who, by her own\r\nspecial request, was godmother to the boy, for Mr Pontifex had decided\r\nthat they were to form a happy family party; so come they all must, and\r\nbe happy they all must, or it would be the worse for them. Next day the\r\nauthor of all this hubbub was actually christened. Theobald had\r\nproposed to call him George after old Mr Pontifex, but strange to say,\r\nMr Pontifex over-ruled him in favour of the name Ernest. The word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cearnest\xe2\x80\x9d was just beginning to come into fashion, and he thought the\r\npossession of such a name might, like his having been baptised in water\r\nfrom the Jordan, have a permanent effect upon the boy\xe2\x80\x99s character, and\r\ninfluence him for good during the more critical periods of his life.\r\n\r\nI was asked to be his second godfather, and was rejoiced to have an\r\nopportunity of meeting Alethea, whom I had not seen for some few years,\r\nbut with whom I had been in constant correspondence. She and I had\r\nalways been friends from the time we had played together as children\r\nonwards. When the death of her grandfather and grandmother severed her\r\nconnection with Paleham my intimacy with the Pontifexes was kept up by\r\nmy having been at school and college with Theobald, and each time I saw\r\nher I admired her more and more as the best, kindest, wittiest, most\r\nlovable, and, to my mind, handsomest woman whom I had ever seen. None\r\nof the Pontifexes were deficient in good looks; they were a well-grown\r\nshapely family enough, but Alethea was the flower of the flock even as\r\nregards good looks, while in respect of all other qualities that make a\r\nwoman lovable, it seemed as though the stock that had been intended for\r\nthe three daughters, and would have been about sufficient for them, had\r\nall been allotted to herself, her sisters getting none, and she all.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for me to explain how it was that she and I never\r\nmarried. We two knew exceedingly well, and that must suffice for the\r\nreader. There was the most perfect sympathy and understanding between\r\nus; we knew that neither of us would marry anyone else. I had asked her\r\nto marry me a dozen times over; having said this much I will say no\r\nmore upon a point which is in no way necessary for the development of\r\nmy story. For the last few years there had been difficulties in the way\r\nof our meeting, and I had not seen her, though, as I have said, keeping\r\nup a close correspondence with her. Naturally I was overjoyed to meet\r\nher again; she was now just thirty years old, but I thought she looked\r\nhandsomer than ever.\r\n\r\nHer father, of course, was the lion of the party, but seeing that we\r\nwere all meek and quite willing to be eaten, he roared to us rather\r\nthan at us. It was a fine sight to see him tucking his napkin under his\r\nrosy old gills, and letting it fall over his capacious waistcoat while\r\nthe high light from the chandelier danced about the bump of benevolence\r\non his bald old head like a star of Bethlehem.\r\n\r\nThe soup was real turtle; the old gentleman was evidently well pleased\r\nand he was beginning to come out. Gelstrap stood behind his master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchair. I sat next Mrs Theobald on her left hand, and was thus just\r\nopposite her father-in-law, whom I had every opportunity of observing.\r\n\r\nDuring the first ten minutes or so, which were taken up with the soup\r\nand the bringing in of the fish, I should probably have thought, if I\r\nhad not long since made up my mind about him, what a fine old man he\r\nwas and how proud his children should be of him; but suddenly as he was\r\nhelping himself to lobster sauce, he flushed crimson, a look of extreme\r\nvexation suffused his face, and he darted two furtive but fiery glances\r\nto the two ends of the table, one for Theobald and one for Christina.\r\nThey, poor simple souls, of course saw that something was exceedingly\r\nwrong, and so did I, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t guess what it was till I heard the\r\nold man hiss in Christina\xe2\x80\x99s ear: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not made with a hen lobster.\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cof my calling the boy Ernest, and\r\ngetting him christened in water from the Jordan, if his own father does\r\nnot know a cock from a hen lobster?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis cut me too, for I felt that till that moment I had not so much as\r\nknown that there were cocks and hens among lobsters, but had vaguely\r\nthought that in the matter of matrimony they were even as the angels in\r\nheaven, and grew up almost spontaneously from rocks and sea-weed.\r\n\r\nBefore the next course was over Mr Pontifex had recovered his temper,\r\nand from that time to the end of the evening he was at his best. He\r\ntold us all about the water from the Jordan; how it had been brought by\r\nDr Jones along with some stone jars of water from the Rhine, the Rhone,\r\nthe Elbe and the Danube, and what trouble he had had with them at the\r\nCustom Houses, and how the intention had been to make punch with waters\r\nfrom all the greatest rivers in Europe; and how he, Mr Pontifex, had\r\nsaved the Jordan water from going into the bowl, etc., etc. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\r\nno,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cit wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done at all, you know; very\r\nprofane idea; so we each took a pint bottle of it home with us, and the\r\npunch was much better without it. I had a narrow escape with mine,\r\nthough, the other day; I fell over a hamper in the cellar, when I was\r\ngetting it up to bring to Battersby, and if I had not taken the\r\ngreatest care the bottle would certainly have been broken, but I saved\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d And Gelstrap was standing behind his chair all the time!\r\n\r\nNothing more happened to ruffle Mr Pontifex, so we had a delightful\r\nevening, which has often recurred to me while watching the after career\r\nof my godson.\r\n\r\nI called a day or two afterwards and found Mr Pontifex still at\r\nBattersby, laid up with one of those attacks of liver and depression to\r\nwhich he was becoming more and more subject. I stayed to luncheon. The\r\nold gentleman was cross and very difficult; he could eat nothing\xe2\x80\x94had no\r\nappetite at all. Christina tried to coax him with a little bit of the\r\nfleshy part of a mutton chop. \xe2\x80\x9cHow in the name of reason can I be asked\r\nto eat a mutton chop?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed angrily; \xe2\x80\x9cyou forget, my dear\r\nChristina, that you have to deal with a stomach that is totally\r\ndisorganised,\xe2\x80\x9d and he pushed the plate from him, pouting and frowning\r\nlike a naughty old child. Writing as I do by the light of a later\r\nknowledge, I suppose I should have seen nothing in this but the world\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrowing pains, the disturbance inseparable from transition in human\r\nthings. I suppose in reality not a leaf goes yellow in autumn without\r\nceasing to care about its sap and making the parent tree very\r\nuncomfortable by long growling and grumbling\xe2\x80\x94but surely nature might\r\nfind some less irritating way of carrying on business if she would give\r\nher mind to it. Why should the generations overlap one another at all?\r\nWhy cannot we be buried as eggs in neat little cells with ten or twenty\r\nthousand pounds each wrapped round us in Bank of England notes, and\r\nwake up, as the sphex wasp does, to find that its papa and mamma have\r\nnot only left ample provision at its elbow, but have been eaten by\r\nsparrows some weeks before it began to live consciously on its own\r\naccount?\r\n\r\nAbout a year and a half afterwards the tables were turned on\r\nBattersby\xe2\x80\x94for Mrs John Pontifex was safely delivered of a boy. A year\r\nor so later still, George Pontifex was himself struck down suddenly by\r\na fit of paralysis, much as his mother had been, but he did not see the\r\nyears of his mother. When his will was opened, it was found that an\r\noriginal bequest of \xc2\xa320,000 to Theobald himself (over and above the sum\r\nthat had been settled upon him and Christina at the time of his\r\nmarriage) had been cut down to \xc2\xa317,500 when Mr Pontifex left\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csomething\xe2\x80\x9d to Ernest. The \xe2\x80\x9csomething\xe2\x80\x9d proved to be \xc2\xa32500, which was to\r\naccumulate in the hands of trustees. The rest of the property went to\r\nJohn Pontifex, except that each of the daughters was left with about\r\n\xc2\xa315,000 over and above \xc2\xa35000 a piece which they inherited from their\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nTheobald\xe2\x80\x99s father then had told him the truth but not the whole truth.\r\nNevertheless, what right had Theobald to complain? Certainly it was\r\nrather hard to make him think that he and his were to be gainers, and\r\nget the honour and glory of the bequest, when all the time the money\r\nwas virtually being taken out of Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s own pocket. On the other\r\nhand the father doubtless argued that he had never told Theobald he was\r\nto have anything at all; he had a full right to do what he liked with\r\nhis own money; if Theobald chose to indulge in unwarrantable\r\nexpectations that was no affair of his; as it was he was providing for\r\nhim liberally; and if he did take \xc2\xa32500 of Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s share he was\r\nstill leaving it to Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s son, which, of course, was much the same\r\nthing in the end.\r\n\r\nNo one can deny that the testator had strict right upon his side;\r\nnevertheless the reader will agree with me that Theobald and Christina\r\nmight not have considered the christening dinner so great a success if\r\nall the facts had been before them. Mr Pontifex had during his own\r\nlifetime set up a monument in Elmhurst Church to the memory of his wife\r\n(a slab with urns and cherubs like illegitimate children of King George\r\nthe Fourth, and all the rest of it), and had left space for his own\r\nepitaph underneath that of his wife. I do not know whether it was\r\nwritten by one of his children, or whether they got some friend to\r\nwrite it for them. I do not believe that any satire was intended. I\r\nbelieve that it was the intention to convey that nothing short of the\r\nDay of Judgement could give anyone an idea how good a man Mr Pontifex\r\nhad been, but at first I found it hard to think that it was free from\r\nguile.\r\n\r\nThe epitaph begins by giving dates of birth and death; then sets out\r\nthat the deceased was for many years head of the firm of Fairlie and\r\nPontifex, and also resident in the parish of Elmhurst. There is not a\r\nsyllable of either praise or dispraise. The last lines run as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHE NOW LIES AWAITING A JOYFUL RESURRECTION\r\nAT THE LAST DAY.\r\nWHAT MANNER OF MAN HE WAS\r\nTHAT DAY WILL DISCOVER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThis much, however, we may say in the meantime, that having lived to be\r\nnearly seventy-three years old and died rich he must have been in very\r\nfair harmony with his surroundings. I have heard it said sometimes that\r\nsuch and such a person\xe2\x80\x99s life was a lie: but no man\xe2\x80\x99s life can be a\r\nvery bad lie; as long as it continues at all it is at worst nine-tenths\r\nof it true.\r\n\r\nMr Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s life not only continued a long time, but was prosperous\r\nright up to the end. Is not this enough? Being in this world is it not\r\nour most obvious business to make the most of it\xe2\x80\x94to observe what things\r\ndo _bona fide_ tend to long life and comfort, and to act accordingly?\r\nAll animals, except man, know that the principal business of life is to\r\nenjoy it\xe2\x80\x94and they do enjoy it as much as man and other circumstances\r\nwill allow. He has spent his life best who has enjoyed it most; God\r\nwill take care that we do not enjoy it any more than is good for us. If\r\nMr Pontifex is to be blamed it is for not having eaten and drunk less\r\nand thus suffered less from his liver, and lived perhaps a year or two\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nGoodness is naught unless it tends towards old age and sufficiency of\r\nmeans. I speak broadly and _exceptis excipiendis_. So the psalmist\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9cThe righteous shall not lack anything that is good.\xe2\x80\x9d Either this\r\nis mere poetical license, or it follows that he who lacks anything that\r\nis good is not righteous; there is a presumption also that he who has\r\npassed a long life without lacking anything that is good has himself\r\nalso been good enough for practical purposes.\r\n\r\nMr Pontifex never lacked anything he much cared about. True, he might\r\nhave been happier than he was if he had cared about things which he did\r\nnot care for, but the gist of this lies in the \xe2\x80\x9cif he had cared.\xe2\x80\x9d We\r\nhave all sinned and come short of the glory of making ourselves as\r\ncomfortable as we easily might have done, but in this particular case\r\nMr Pontifex did not care, and would not have gained much by getting\r\nwhat he did not want.\r\n\r\nThere is no casting of swine\xe2\x80\x99s meat before men worse than that which\r\nwould flatter virtue as though her true origin were not good enough for\r\nher, but she must have a lineage, deduced as it were by spiritual\r\nheralds, from some stock with which she has nothing to do. Virtue\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntrue lineage is older and more respectable than any that can be\r\ninvented for her. She springs from man\xe2\x80\x99s experience concerning his own\r\nwell-being\xe2\x80\x94and this, though not infallible, is still the least fallible\r\nthing we have. A system which cannot stand without a better foundation\r\nthan this must have something so unstable within itself that it will\r\ntopple over on whatever pedestal we place it.\r\n\r\nThe world has long ago settled that morality and virtue are what bring\r\nmen peace at the last. \xe2\x80\x9cBe virtuous,\xe2\x80\x9d says the copy-book, \xe2\x80\x9cand you will\r\nbe happy.\xe2\x80\x9d Surely if a reputed virtue fails often in this respect it is\r\nonly an insidious form of vice, and if a reputed vice brings no very\r\nserious mischief on a man\xe2\x80\x99s later years it is not so bad a vice as it\r\nis said to be. Unfortunately though we are all of a mind about the main\r\nopinion that virtue is what tends to happiness, and vice what ends in\r\nsorrow, we are not so unanimous about details\xe2\x80\x94that is to say as to\r\nwhether any given course, such, we will say, as smoking, has a tendency\r\nto happiness or the reverse.\r\n\r\nI submit it as the result of my own poor observation, that a good deal\r\nof unkindness and selfishness on the part of parents towards children\r\nis not generally followed by ill consequences to the parents\r\nthemselves. They may cast a gloom over their children\xe2\x80\x99s lives for many\r\nyears without having to suffer anything that will hurt them. I should\r\nsay, then, that it shows no great moral obliquity on the part of\r\nparents if within certain limits they make their children\xe2\x80\x99s lives a\r\nburden to them.\r\n\r\nGranted that Mr Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s was not a very exalted character, ordinary\r\nmen are not required to have very exalted characters. It is enough if\r\nwe are of the same moral and mental stature as the \xe2\x80\x9cmain\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmean\xe2\x80\x9d\r\npart of men\xe2\x80\x94that is to say as the average.\r\n\r\nIt is involved in the very essence of things that rich men who die old\r\nshall have been mean. The greatest and wisest of mankind will be almost\r\nalways found to be the meanest\xe2\x80\x94the ones who have kept the \xe2\x80\x9cmean\xe2\x80\x9d best\r\nbetween excess either of virtue or vice. They hardly ever have been\r\nprosperous if they have not done this, and, considering how many\r\nmiscarry altogether, it is no small feather in a man\xe2\x80\x99s cap if he has\r\nbeen no worse than his neighbours. Homer tells us about some one who\r\nmade it his business \xce\xb1\xce\xb9\xce\xb5\xce\xbd \xce\xb1\xcf\x81\xce\xb9\xcf\x83\xcf\x84\xce\xb5\xcf\x85\xce\xb5\xce\xb9\xce\xbd \xce\xba\xce\xb1\xce\xb9 \xcf\x85\xcf\x80\xce\xb5\xce\xb9\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xcf\x87\xce\xbf\xce\xbd \xce\xb5\xce\xbc\xce\xbc\xce\xb5\xce\xbd\xce\xb1\xce\xb9 \xce\xb1\xce\xbb\xce\xbb\xcf\x89\xce\xbd\xe2\x80\x94always\r\nto excel and to stand higher than other people. What an uncompanionable\r\ndisagreeable person he must have been! Homer\xe2\x80\x99s heroes generally came to\r\na bad end, and I doubt not that this gentleman, whoever he was, did so\r\nsooner or later.\r\n\r\nA very high standard, again, involves the possession of rare virtues,\r\nand rare virtues are like rare plants or animals, things that have not\r\nbeen able to hold their own in the world. A virtue to be serviceable\r\nmust, like gold, be alloyed with some commoner but more durable metal.\r\n\r\nPeople divide off vice and virtue as though they were two things,\r\nneither of which had with it anything of the other. This is not so.\r\nThere is no useful virtue which has not some alloy of vice, and hardly\r\nany vice, if any, which carries not with it a little dash of virtue;\r\nvirtue and vice are like life and death, or mind and matter\xe2\x80\x94things\r\nwhich cannot exist without being qualified by their opposite. The most\r\nabsolute life contains death, and the corpse is still in many respects\r\nliving; so also it has been said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf thou, Lord, wilt be extreme to\r\nmark what is done amiss,\xe2\x80\x9d which shows that even the highest ideal we\r\ncan conceive will yet admit so much compromise with vice as shall\r\ncountenance the poor abuses of the time, if they are not too\r\noutrageous. That vice pays homage to virtue is notorious; we call this\r\nhypocrisy; there should be a word found for the homage which virtue not\r\nunfrequently pays, or at any rate would be wise in paying, to vice.\r\n\r\nI grant that some men will find happiness in having what we all feel to\r\nbe a higher moral standard than others. If they go in for this,\r\nhowever, they must be content with virtue as her own reward, and not\r\ngrumble if they find lofty Quixotism an expensive luxury, whose rewards\r\nbelong to a kingdom that is not of this world. They must not wonder if\r\nthey cut a poor figure in trying to make the most of both worlds.\r\nDisbelieve as we may the details of the accounts which record the\r\ngrowth of the Christian religion, yet a great part of Christian\r\nteaching will remain as true as though we accepted the details. We\r\ncannot serve God and Mammon; strait is the way and narrow is the gate\r\nwhich leads to what those who live by faith hold to be best worth\r\nhaving, and there is no way of saying this better than the Bible has\r\ndone. It is well there should be some who think thus, as it is well\r\nthere should be speculators in commerce, who will often burn their\r\nfingers\xe2\x80\x94but it is not well that the majority should leave the \xe2\x80\x9cmean\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand beaten path.\r\n\r\nFor most men, and most circumstances, pleasure\xe2\x80\x94tangible material\r\nprosperity in this world\xe2\x80\x94is the safest test of virtue. Progress has\r\never been through the pleasures rather than through the extreme sharp\r\nvirtues, and the most virtuous have leaned to excess rather than to\r\nasceticism. To use a commercial metaphor, competition is so keen, and\r\nthe margin of profits has been cut down so closely that virtue cannot\r\nafford to throw any _bona fide_ chance away, and must base her action\r\nrather on the actual moneying out of conduct than on a flattering\r\nprospectus. She will not therefore neglect\xe2\x80\x94as some do who are prudent\r\nand economical enough in other matters\xe2\x80\x94the important factor of our\r\nchance of escaping detection, or at any rate of our dying first. A\r\nreasonable virtue will give this chance its due value, neither more nor\r\nless.\r\n\r\nPleasure, after all, is a safer guide than either right or duty. For\r\nhard as it is to know what gives us pleasure, right and duty are often\r\nstill harder to distinguish and, if we go wrong with them, will lead us\r\ninto just as sorry a plight as a mistaken opinion concerning pleasure.\r\nWhen men burn their fingers through following after pleasure they find\r\nout their mistake and get to see where they have gone wrong more easily\r\nthan when they have burnt them through following after a fancied duty,\r\nor a fancied idea concerning right virtue. The devil, in fact, when he\r\ndresses himself in angel\xe2\x80\x99s clothes, can only be detected by experts of\r\nexceptional skill, and so often does he adopt this disguise that it is\r\nhardly safe to be seen talking to an angel at all, and prudent people\r\nwill follow after pleasure as a more homely but more respectable and on\r\nthe whole much more trustworthy guide.\r\n\r\nReturning to Mr Pontifex, over and above his having lived long and\r\nprosperously, he left numerous offspring, to all of whom he\r\ncommunicated not only his physical and mental characteristics, with no\r\nmore than the usual amount of modification, but also no small share of\r\ncharacteristics which are less easily transmitted\xe2\x80\x94I mean his pecuniary\r\ncharacteristics. It may be said that he acquired these by sitting still\r\nand letting money run, as it were, right up against him, but against\r\nhow many does not money run who do not take it when it does, or who,\r\neven if they hold it for a little while, cannot so incorporate it with\r\nthemselves that it shall descend through them to their offspring? Mr\r\nPontifex did this. He kept what he may be said to have made, and money\r\nis like a reputation for ability\xe2\x80\x94more easily made than kept.\r\n\r\nTake him, then, for all in all, I am not inclined to be so severe upon\r\nhim as my father was. Judge him according to any very lofty standard,\r\nand he is nowhere. Judge him according to a fair average standard, and\r\nthere is not much fault to be found with him. I have said what I have\r\nsaid in the foregoing chapter once for all, and shall not break my\r\nthread to repeat it. It should go without saying in modification of the\r\nverdict which the reader may be inclined to pass too hastily, not only\r\nupon Mr George Pontifex, but also upon Theobald and Christina. And now\r\nI will continue my story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe birth of his son opened Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s eyes to a good deal which he had\r\nbut faintly realised hitherto. He had had no idea how great a nuisance\r\na baby was. Babies come into the world so suddenly at the end, and\r\nupset everything so terribly when they do come: why cannot they steal\r\nin upon us with less of a shock to the domestic system? His wife, too,\r\ndid not recover rapidly from her confinement; she remained an invalid\r\nfor months; here was another nuisance and an expensive one, which\r\ninterfered with the amount which Theobald liked to put by out of his\r\nincome against, as he said, a rainy day, or to make provision for his\r\nfamily if he should have one. Now he was getting a family, so that it\r\nbecame all the more necessary to put money by, and here was the baby\r\nhindering him. Theorists may say what they like about a man\xe2\x80\x99s children\r\nbeing a continuation of his own identity, but it will generally be\r\nfound that those who talk in this way have no children of their own.\r\nPractical family men know better.\r\n\r\nAbout twelve months after the birth of Ernest there came a second, also\r\na boy, who was christened Joseph, and in less than twelve months\r\nafterwards, a girl, to whom was given the name of Charlotte. A few\r\nmonths before this girl was born Christina paid a visit to the John\r\nPontifexes in London, and, knowing her condition, passed a good deal of\r\ntime at the Royal Academy exhibition looking at the types of female\r\nbeauty portrayed by the Academicians, for she had made up her mind that\r\nthe child this time was to be a girl. Alethea warned her not to do\r\nthis, but she persisted, and certainly the child turned out plain, but\r\nwhether the pictures caused this or no I cannot say.\r\n\r\nTheobald had never liked children. He had always got away from them as\r\nsoon as he could, and so had they from him; oh, why, he was inclined to\r\nask himself, could not children be born into the world grown up? If\r\nChristina could have given birth to a few full-grown clergymen in\r\npriest\xe2\x80\x99s orders\xe2\x80\x94of moderate views, but inclining rather to\r\nEvangelicalism, with comfortable livings and in all respects facsimiles\r\nof Theobald himself\xe2\x80\x94why, there might have been more sense in it; or if\r\npeople could buy ready-made children at a shop of whatever age and sex\r\nthey liked, instead of always having to make them at home and to begin\r\nat the beginning with them\xe2\x80\x94that might do better, but as it was he did\r\nnot like it. He felt as he had felt when he had been required to come\r\nand be married to Christina\xe2\x80\x94that he had been going on for a long time\r\nquite nicely, and would much rather continue things on their present\r\nfooting. In the matter of getting married he had been obliged to\r\npretend he liked it; but times were changed, and if he did not like a\r\nthing now, he could find a hundred unexceptionable ways of making his\r\ndislike apparent.\r\n\r\nIt might have been better if Theobald in his younger days had kicked\r\nmore against his father: the fact that he had not done so encouraged\r\nhim to expect the most implicit obedience from his own children. He\r\ncould trust himself, he said (and so did Christina), to be more lenient\r\nthan perhaps his father had been to himself; his danger, he said (and\r\nso again did Christina), would be rather in the direction of being too\r\nindulgent; he must be on his guard against this, for no duty could be\r\nmore important than that of teaching a child to obey its parents in all\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nHe had read not long since of an Eastern traveller, who, while\r\nexploring somewhere in the more remote parts of Arabia and Asia Minor,\r\nhad come upon a remarkably hardy, sober, industrious little Christian\r\ncommunity\xe2\x80\x94all of them in the best of health\xe2\x80\x94who had turned out to be\r\nthe actual living descendants of Jonadab, the son of Rechab; and two\r\nmen in European costume, indeed, but speaking English with a broken\r\naccent, and by their colour evidently Oriental, had come begging to\r\nBattersby soon afterwards, and represented themselves as belonging to\r\nthis people; they had said they were collecting funds to promote the\r\nconversion of their fellow tribesmen to the English branch of the\r\nChristian religion. True, they turned out to be impostors, for when he\r\ngave them a pound and Christina five shillings from her private purse,\r\nthey went and got drunk with it in the next village but one to\r\nBattersby; still, this did not invalidate the story of the Eastern\r\ntraveller. Then there were the Romans\xe2\x80\x94whose greatness was probably due\r\nto the wholesome authority exercised by the head of a family over all\r\nits members. Some Romans had even killed their children; this was going\r\ntoo far, but then the Romans were not Christians, and knew no better.\r\n\r\nThe practical outcome of the foregoing was a conviction in Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind, and if in his, then in Christina\xe2\x80\x99s, that it was their duty to\r\nbegin training up their children in the way they should go, even from\r\ntheir earliest infancy. The first signs of self-will must be carefully\r\nlooked for, and plucked up by the roots at once before they had time to\r\ngrow. Theobald picked up this numb serpent of a metaphor and cherished\r\nit in his bosom.\r\n\r\nBefore Ernest could well crawl he was taught to kneel; before he could\r\nwell speak he was taught to lisp the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s prayer, and the general\r\nconfession. How was it possible that these things could be taught too\r\nearly? If his attention flagged or his memory failed him, here was an\r\nill weed which would grow apace, unless it were plucked out\r\nimmediately, and the only way to pluck it out was to whip him, or shut\r\nhim up in a cupboard, or dock him of some of the small pleasures of\r\nchildhood. Before he was three years old he could read and, after a\r\nfashion, write. Before he was four he was learning Latin, and could do\r\nrule of three sums.\r\n\r\nAs for the child himself, he was naturally of an even temper, he doted\r\nupon his nurse, on kittens and puppies, and on all things that would do\r\nhim the kindness of allowing him to be fond of them. He was fond of his\r\nmother, too, but as regards his father, he has told me in later life he\r\ncould remember no feeling but fear and shrinking. Christina did not\r\nremonstrate with Theobald concerning the severity of the tasks imposed\r\nupon their boy, nor yet as to the continual whippings that were found\r\nnecessary at lesson times. Indeed, when during any absence of\r\nTheobald\xe2\x80\x99s the lessons were entrusted to her, she found to her sorrow\r\nthat it was the only thing to do, and she did it no less effectually\r\nthan Theobald himself, nevertheless she was fond of her boy, which\r\nTheobald never was, and it was long before she could destroy all\r\naffection for herself in the mind of her first-born. But she\r\npersevered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nStrange! for she believed she doted upon him, and certainly she loved\r\nhim better than either of her other children. Her version of the matter\r\nwas that there had never yet been two parents so self-denying and\r\ndevoted to the highest welfare of their children as Theobald and\r\nherself. For Ernest, a very great future\xe2\x80\x94she was certain of it\xe2\x80\x94was in\r\nstore. This made severity all the more necessary, so that from the\r\nfirst he might have been kept pure from every taint of evil. She could\r\nnot allow herself the scope for castle building which, we read, was\r\nindulged in by every Jewish matron before the appearance of the\r\nMessiah, for the Messiah had now come, but there was to be a millennium\r\nshortly, certainly not later than 1866, when Ernest would be just about\r\nthe right age for it, and a modern Elias would be wanted to herald its\r\napproach. Heaven would bear her witness that she had never shrunk from\r\nthe idea of martyrdom for herself and Theobald, nor would she avoid it\r\nfor her boy, if his life was required of her in her Redeemer\xe2\x80\x99s service.\r\nOh, no! If God told her to offer up her first-born, as He had told\r\nAbraham, she would take him up to Pigbury Beacon and plunge the\xe2\x80\x94no,\r\nthat she could not do, but it would be unnecessary\xe2\x80\x94some one else might\r\ndo that. It was not for nothing that Ernest had been baptised in water\r\nfrom the Jordan. It had not been her doing, nor yet Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s. They\r\nhad not sought it. When water from the sacred stream was wanted for a\r\nsacred infant, the channel had been found through which it was to flow\r\nfrom far Palestine over land and sea to the door of the house where the\r\nchild was lying. Why, it was a miracle! It was! It was! She saw it all\r\nnow. The Jordan had left its bed and flowed into her own house. It was\r\nidle to say that this was not a miracle. No miracle was effected\r\nwithout means of some kind; the difference between the faithful and the\r\nunbeliever consisted in the very fact that the former could see a\r\nmiracle where the latter could not. The Jews could see no miracle even\r\nin the raising of Lazarus and the feeding of the five thousand. The\r\nJohn Pontifexes would see no miracle in this matter of the water from\r\nthe Jordan. The essence of a miracle lay not in the fact that means had\r\nbeen dispensed with, but in the adoption of means to a great end that\r\nhad not been available without interference; and no one would suppose\r\nthat Dr Jones would have brought the water unless he had been directed.\r\nShe would tell this to Theobald, and get him to see it in the . . . and\r\nyet perhaps it would be better not. The insight of women upon matters\r\nof this sort was deeper and more unerring than that of men. It was a\r\nwoman and not a man who had been filled most completely with the whole\r\nfulness of the Deity. But why had they not treasured up the water after\r\nit was used? It ought never, never to have been thrown away, but it had\r\nbeen. Perhaps, however, this was for the best too\xe2\x80\x94they might have been\r\ntempted to set too much store by it, and it might have become a source\r\nof spiritual danger to them\xe2\x80\x94perhaps even of spiritual pride, the very\r\nsin of all others which she most abhorred. As for the channel through\r\nwhich the Jordan had flowed to Battersby, that mattered not more than\r\nthe earth through which the river ran in Palestine itself. Dr Jones was\r\ncertainly worldly\xe2\x80\x94very worldly; so, she regretted to feel, had been her\r\nfather-in-law, though in a less degree; spiritual, at heart, doubtless,\r\nand becoming more and more spiritual continually as he grew older,\r\nstill he was tainted with the world, till a very few hours, probably,\r\nbefore his death, whereas she and Theobald had given up all for\r\nChrist\xe2\x80\x99s sake. _They_ were not worldly. At least Theobald was not. She\r\nhad been, but she was sure she had grown in grace since she had left\r\noff eating things strangled and blood\xe2\x80\x94this was as the washing in Jordan\r\nas against Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus. Her boy should never\r\ntouch a strangled fowl nor a black pudding\xe2\x80\x94that, at any rate, she could\r\nsee to. He should have a coral from the neighbourhood of Joppa\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nwere coral insects on those coasts, so that the thing could easily be\r\ndone with a little energy; she would write to Dr Jones about it, etc.\r\nAnd so on for hours together day after day for years. Truly, Mrs\r\nTheobald loved her child according to her lights with an exceeding\r\ngreat fondness, but the dreams she had dreamed in sleep were sober\r\nrealities in comparison with those she indulged in while awake.\r\n\r\nWhen Ernest was in his second year, Theobald, as I have already said,\r\nbegan to teach him to read. He began to whip him two days after he had\r\nbegun to teach him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was painful,\xe2\x80\x9d as he said to Christina, but it was the only thing to\r\ndo and it was done. The child was puny, white and sickly, so they sent\r\ncontinually for the doctor who dosed him with calomel and James\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npowder. All was done in love, anxiety, timidity, stupidity, and\r\nimpatience. They were stupid in little things; and he that is stupid in\r\nlittle will be stupid also in much.\r\n\r\nPresently old Mr Pontifex died, and then came the revelation of the\r\nlittle alteration he had made in his will simultaneously with his\r\nbequest to Ernest. It was rather hard to bear, especially as there was\r\nno way of conveying a bit of their minds to the testator now that he\r\ncould no longer hurt them. As regards the boy himself anyone must see\r\nthat the bequest would be an unmitigated misfortune to him. To leave\r\nhim a small independence was perhaps the greatest injury which one\r\ncould inflict upon a young man. It would cripple his energies, and\r\ndeaden his desire for active employment. Many a youth was led into evil\r\ncourses by the knowledge that on arriving at majority he would come\r\ninto a few thousands. They might surely have been trusted to have their\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s interests at heart, and must be better judges of those interests\r\nthan he, at twenty-one, could be expected to be: besides if Jonadab,\r\nthe son of Rechab\xe2\x80\x99s father\xe2\x80\x94or perhaps it might be simpler under the\r\ncircumstances to say Rechab at once\xe2\x80\x94if Rechab, then, had left handsome\r\nlegacies to his grandchildren\xe2\x80\x94why Jonadab might not have found those\r\nchildren so easy to deal with, etc. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Theobald, after\r\nhaving discussed the matter with Christina for the twentieth time, \xe2\x80\x9cmy\r\ndear, the only thing to guide and console us under misfortunes of this\r\nkind is to take refuge in practical work. I will go and pay a visit to\r\nMrs Thompson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn those days Mrs Thompson would be told that her sins were all washed\r\nwhite, etc., a little sooner and a little more peremptorily than on\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\nI used to stay at Battersby for a day or two sometimes, while my godson\r\nand his brother and sister were children. I hardly know why I went, for\r\nTheobald and I grew more and more apart, but one gets into grooves\r\nsometimes, and the supposed friendship between myself and the\r\nPontifexes continued to exist, though it was now little more than\r\nrudimentary. My godson pleased me more than either of the other\r\nchildren, but he had not much of the buoyancy of childhood, and was\r\nmore like a puny, sallow little old man than I liked. The young people,\r\nhowever, were very ready to be friendly.\r\n\r\nI remember Ernest and his brother hovered round me on the first day of\r\none of these visits with their hands full of fading flowers, which they\r\nat length proffered me. On this I did what I suppose was expected: I\r\ninquired if there was a shop near where they could buy sweeties. They\r\nsaid there was, so I felt in my pockets, but only succeeded in finding\r\ntwo pence halfpenny in small money. This I gave them, and the\r\nyoungsters, aged four and three, toddled off alone. Ere long they\r\nreturned, and Ernest said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t get sweeties for all this money\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(I felt rebuked, but no rebuke was intended); \xe2\x80\x9cwe can get sweeties for\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x9d (showing a penny), \xe2\x80\x9cand for this\xe2\x80\x9d (showing another penny), \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nwe cannot get them for all this,\xe2\x80\x9d and he added the halfpenny to the two\r\npence. I suppose they had wanted a twopenny cake, or something like\r\nthat. I was amused, and left them to solve the difficulty their own\r\nway, being anxious to see what they would do.\r\n\r\nPresently Ernest said, \xe2\x80\x9cMay we give you back this\xe2\x80\x9d (showing the\r\nhalfpenny) \xe2\x80\x9cand not give you back this and this?\xe2\x80\x9d (showing the pence).\r\nI assented, and they gave a sigh of relief and went on their way\r\nrejoicing. A few more presents of pence and small toys completed the\r\nconquest, and they began to take me into their confidence.\r\n\r\nThey told me a good deal which I am afraid I ought not to have listened\r\nto. They said that if grandpapa had lived longer he would most likely\r\nhave been made a Lord, and that then papa would have been the\r\nHonourable and Reverend, but that grandpapa was now in heaven singing\r\nbeautiful hymns with grandmamma Allaby to Jesus Christ, who was very\r\nfond of them; and that when Ernest was ill, his mamma had told him he\r\nneed not be afraid of dying for he would go straight to heaven, if he\r\nwould only be sorry for having done his lessons so badly and vexed his\r\ndear papa, and if he would promise never, never to vex him any more;\r\nand that when he got to heaven grandpapa and grandmamma Allaby would\r\nmeet him, and he would be always with them, and they would be very good\r\nto him and teach him to sing ever such beautiful hymns, more beautiful\r\nby far than those which he was now so fond of, etc., etc.; but he did\r\nnot wish to die, and was glad when he got better, for there were no\r\nkittens in heaven, and he did not think there were cowslips to make\r\ncowslip tea with.\r\n\r\nTheir mother was plainly disappointed in them. \xe2\x80\x9cMy children are none of\r\nthem geniuses, Mr Overton,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to me at breakfast one morning.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have fair abilities, and, thanks to Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s tuition, they are\r\nforward for their years, but they have nothing like genius: genius is a\r\nthing apart from this, is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course I said it was \xe2\x80\x9ca thing quite apart from this,\xe2\x80\x9d but if my\r\nthoughts had been laid bare, they would have appeared as \xe2\x80\x9cGive me my\r\ncoffee immediately, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, and don\xe2\x80\x99t talk nonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d I have no idea\r\nwhat genius is, but so far as I can form any conception about it, I\r\nshould say it was a stupid word which cannot be too soon abandoned to\r\nscientific and literary _claqueurs_.\r\n\r\nI do not know exactly what Christina expected, but I should imagine it\r\nwas something like this: \xe2\x80\x9cMy children ought to be all geniuses, because\r\nthey are mine and Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s, and it is naughty of them not to be; but,\r\nof course, they cannot be so good and clever as Theobald and I were,\r\nand if they show signs of being so it will be naughty of them. Happily,\r\nhowever, they are not this, and yet it is very dreadful that they are\r\nnot. As for genius\xe2\x80\x94hoity-toity, indeed\xe2\x80\x94why, a genius should turn\r\nintellectual summersaults as soon as it is born, and none of my\r\nchildren have yet been able to get into the newspapers. I will not have\r\nchildren of mine give themselves airs\xe2\x80\x94it is enough for them that\r\nTheobald and I should do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not know, poor woman, that the true greatness wears an\r\ninvisible cloak, under cover of which it goes in and out among men\r\nwithout being suspected; if its cloak does not conceal it from itself\r\nalways, and from all others for many years, its greatness will ere long\r\nshrink to very ordinary dimensions. What, then, it may be asked, is the\r\ngood of being great? The answer is that you may understand greatness\r\nbetter in others, whether alive or dead, and choose better company from\r\nthese and enjoy and understand that company better when you have chosen\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94also that you may be able to give pleasure to the best people and\r\nlive in the lives of those who are yet unborn. This, one would think,\r\nwas substantial gain enough for greatness without its wanting to ride\r\nrough-shod over us, even when disguised as humility.\r\n\r\nI was there on a Sunday, and observed the rigour with which the young\r\npeople were taught to observe the Sabbath; they might not cut out\r\nthings, nor use their paintbox on a Sunday, and this they thought\r\nrather hard, because their cousins the John Pontifexes might do these\r\nthings. Their cousins might play with their toy train on Sunday, but\r\nthough they had promised that they would run none but Sunday trains,\r\nall traffic had been prohibited. One treat only was allowed them\xe2\x80\x94on\r\nSunday evenings they might choose their own hymns.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the evening they came into the drawing-room, and, as\r\nan especial treat, were to sing some of their hymns to me, instead of\r\nsaying them, so that I might hear how nicely they sang. Ernest was to\r\nchoose the first hymn, and he chose one about some people who were to\r\ncome to the sunset tree. I am no botanist, and do not know what kind of\r\ntree a sunset tree is, but the words began, \xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, come; come to\r\nthe sunset tree for the day is past and gone.\xe2\x80\x9d The tune was rather\r\npretty and had taken Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s fancy, for he was unusually fond of music\r\nand had a sweet little child\xe2\x80\x99s voice which he liked using.\r\n\r\nHe was, however, very late in being able to sound a hard it \xe2\x80\x9cc\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ck,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand, instead of saying \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d he said \xe2\x80\x9cTum tum, tum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cErnest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Theobald, from the arm-chair in front of the fire, where\r\nhe was sitting with his hands folded before him, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you think it\r\nwould be very nice if you were to say \xe2\x80\x98come\xe2\x80\x99 like other people, instead\r\nof \xe2\x80\x98tum\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do say tum,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ernest, meaning that he had said \xe2\x80\x9ccome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheobald was always in a bad temper on Sunday evening. Whether it is\r\nthat they are as much bored with the day as their neighbours, or\r\nwhether they are tired, or whatever the cause may be, clergymen are\r\nseldom at their best on Sunday evening; I had already seen signs that\r\nevening that my host was cross, and was a little nervous at hearing\r\nErnest say so promptly \xe2\x80\x9cI do say tum,\xe2\x80\x9d when his papa had said he did\r\nnot say it as he should.\r\n\r\nTheobald noticed the fact that he was being contradicted in a moment.\r\nHe got up from his arm-chair and went to the piano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Ernest, you don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou say nothing of the kind, you say\r\n\xe2\x80\x98tum,\xe2\x80\x99 not \xe2\x80\x98come.\xe2\x80\x99 Now say \xe2\x80\x98come\xe2\x80\x99 after me, as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ernest, at once; \xe2\x80\x9cis that better?\xe2\x80\x9d I have no doubt he\r\nthought it was, but it was not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Ernest, you are not taking pains: you are not trying as you ought\r\nto do. It is high time you learned to say \xe2\x80\x98come,\xe2\x80\x99 why, Joey can say\r\n\xe2\x80\x98come,\xe2\x80\x99 can\xe2\x80\x99t you, Joey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeth, I can,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Joey, and he said something which was not far\r\noff \xe2\x80\x9ccome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, Ernest, do you hear that? There\xe2\x80\x99s no difficulty about it, nor\r\nshadow of difficulty. Now, take your own time, think about it, and say\r\n\xe2\x80\x98come\xe2\x80\x99 after me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy remained silent a few seconds and then said \xe2\x80\x9ctum\xe2\x80\x9d again.\r\n\r\nI laughed, but Theobald turned to me impatiently and said, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease do\r\nnot laugh, Overton; it will make the boy think it does not matter, and\r\nit matters a great deal;\xe2\x80\x9d then turning to Ernest he said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Ernest,\r\nI will give you one more chance, and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x98come,\xe2\x80\x99 I shall\r\nknow that you are self-willed and naughty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked very angry, and a shade came over Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s face, like that\r\nwhich comes upon the face of a puppy when it is being scolded without\r\nunderstanding why. The child saw well what was coming now, was\r\nfrightened, and, of course, said \xe2\x80\x9ctum\xe2\x80\x9d once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, Ernest,\xe2\x80\x9d said his father, catching him angrily by the\r\nshoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cI have done my best to save you, but if you will have it so,\r\nyou will,\xe2\x80\x9d and he lugged the little wretch, crying by anticipation, out\r\nof the room. A few minutes more and we could hear screams coming from\r\nthe dining-room, across the hall which separated the drawing-room from\r\nthe dining-room, and knew that poor Ernest was being beaten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have sent him up to bed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Theobald, as he returned to the\r\ndrawing-room, \xe2\x80\x9cand now, Christina, I think we will have the servants in\r\nto prayers,\xe2\x80\x9d and he rang the bell for them, red-handed as he was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man-servant William came and set the chairs for the maids, and\r\npresently they filed in. First Christina\xe2\x80\x99s maid, then the cook, then\r\nthe housemaid, then William, and then the coachman. I sat opposite\r\nthem, and watched their faces as Theobald read a chapter from the\r\nBible. They were nice people, but more absolute vacancy I never saw\r\nupon the countenances of human beings.\r\n\r\nTheobald began by reading a few verses from the Old Testament,\r\naccording to some system of his own. On this occasion the passage came\r\nfrom the fifteenth chapter of Numbers: it had no particular bearing\r\nthat I could see upon anything which was going on just then, but the\r\nspirit which breathed throughout the whole seemed to me to be so like\r\nthat of Theobald himself, that I could understand better after hearing\r\nit, how he came to think as he thought, and act as he acted.\r\n\r\nThe verses are as follows\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the soul that doeth aught presumptuously, whether he be born in\r\nthe land or a stranger, the same reproacheth the Lord; and that soul\r\nshall be cut off from among his people.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he hath despised the word of the Lord, and hath broken His\r\ncommandments, that soul shall be utterly cut off; his iniquity shall be\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd while the children of Israel were in the wilderness they found a\r\nman that gathered sticks upon the Sabbath day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and\r\nAaron, and unto all the congregation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they put him in ward because it was not declared what should be\r\ndone to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the Lord said unto Moses, the man shall be surely put to death;\r\nall the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him\r\nwith stones, and he died; as the Lord commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them\r\nfringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations,\r\nand that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it and\r\nremember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them, and that ye\r\nseek not after your own heart and your own eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat ye may remember and do all my commandments and be holy unto your\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the Lord your God which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to\r\nbe your God: I am the Lord your God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy thoughts wandered while Theobald was reading the above, and reverted\r\nto a little matter which I had observed in the course of the afternoon.\r\n\r\nIt happened that some years previously, a swarm of bees had taken up\r\ntheir abode in the roof of the house under the slates, and had\r\nmultiplied so that the drawing-room was a good deal frequented by these\r\nbees during the summer, when the windows were open. The drawing-room\r\npaper was of a pattern which consisted of bunches of red and white\r\nroses, and I saw several bees at different times fly up to these\r\nbunches and try them, under the impression that they were real flowers;\r\nhaving tried one bunch, they tried the next, and the next, and the\r\nnext, till they reached the one that was nearest the ceiling, then they\r\nwent down bunch by bunch as they had ascended, till they were stopped\r\nby the back of the sofa; on this they ascended bunch by bunch to the\r\nceiling again; and so on, and so on till I was tired of watching them.\r\nAs I thought of the family prayers being repeated night and morning,\r\nweek by week, month by month, and year by year, I could nor help\r\nthinking how like it was to the way in which the bees went up the wall\r\nand down the wall, bunch by bunch, without ever suspecting that so many\r\nof the associated ideas could be present, and yet the main idea be\r\nwanting hopelessly, and for ever.\r\n\r\nWhen Theobald had finished reading we all knelt down and the Carlo\r\nDolci and the Sassoferrato looked down upon a sea of upturned backs, as\r\nwe buried our faces in our chairs. I noted that Theobald prayed that we\r\nmight be made \xe2\x80\x9ctruly honest and conscientious\xe2\x80\x9d in all our dealings, and\r\nsmiled at the introduction of the \xe2\x80\x9ctruly.\xe2\x80\x9d Then my thoughts ran back to\r\nthe bees and I reflected that after all it was perhaps as well at any\r\nrate for Theobald that our prayers were seldom marked by any very\r\nencouraging degree of response, for if I had thought there was the\r\nslightest chance of my being heard I should have prayed that some one\r\nmight ere long treat him as he had treated Ernest.\r\n\r\nThen my thoughts wandered on to those calculations which people make\r\nabout waste of time and how much one can get done if one gives ten\r\nminutes a day to it, and I was thinking what improper suggestion I\r\ncould make in connection with this and the time spent on family prayers\r\nwhich should at the same time be just tolerable, when I heard Theobald\r\nbeginning \xe2\x80\x9cThe grace of our Lord Jesus Christ\xe2\x80\x9d and in a few seconds the\r\nceremony was over, and the servants filed out again as they had filed\r\nin.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had left the drawing-room, Christina, who was a little\r\nashamed of the transaction to which I had been a witness, imprudently\r\nreturned to it, and began to justify it, saying that it cut her to the\r\nheart, and that it cut Theobald to the heart and a good deal more, but\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x9cit was the only thing to be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI received this as coldly as I decently could, and by my silence during\r\nthe rest of the evening showed that I disapproved of what I had seen.\r\n\r\nNext day I was to go back to London, but before I went I said I should\r\nlike to take some new-laid eggs back with me, so Theobald took me to\r\nthe house of a labourer in the village who lived a stone\xe2\x80\x99s throw from\r\nthe Rectory as being likely to supply me with them. Ernest, for some\r\nreason or other, was allowed to come too. I think the hens had begun to\r\nsit, but at any rate eggs were scarce, and the cottager\xe2\x80\x99s wife could\r\nnot find me more than seven or eight, which we proceeded to wrap up in\r\nseparate pieces of paper so that I might take them to town safely.\r\n\r\nThis operation was carried on upon the ground in front of the cottage\r\ndoor, and while we were in the midst of it the cottager\xe2\x80\x99s little boy, a\r\nlad much about Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s age, trod upon one of the eggs that was wrapped\r\nup in paper and broke it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now, Jack,\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother, \xe2\x80\x9csee what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done, you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbroken a nice egg and cost me a penny\xe2\x80\x94Here, Emma,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, calling\r\nher daughter, \xe2\x80\x9ctake the child away, there\xe2\x80\x99s a dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma came at once, and walked off with the youngster, taking him out of\r\nharm\xe2\x80\x99s way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ernest, after we had left the house, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t Mrs\r\nHeaton whip Jack when he trod on the egg?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was spiteful enough to give Theobald a grim smile which said as\r\nplainly as words could have done that I thought Ernest had hit him\r\nrather hard.\r\n\r\nTheobald coloured and looked angry. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say,\xe2\x80\x9d he said quickly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat his mother will whip him now that we are gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was not going to have this and said I did not believe it, and so the\r\nmatter dropped, but Theobald did not forget it and my visits to\r\nBattersby were henceforth less frequent.\r\n\r\nOn our return to the house we found the postman had arrived and had\r\nbrought a letter appointing Theobald to a rural deanery which had\r\nlately fallen vacant by the death of one of the neighbouring clergy who\r\nhad held the office for many years. The bishop wrote to Theobald most\r\nwarmly, and assured him that he valued him as among the most\r\nhard-working and devoted of his parochial clergy. Christina of course\r\nwas delighted, and gave me to understand that it was only an instalment\r\nof the much higher dignities which were in store for Theobald when his\r\nmerits were more widely known.\r\n\r\nI did not then foresee how closely my godson\xe2\x80\x99s life and mine were in\r\nafter years to be bound up together; if I had, I should doubtless have\r\nlooked upon him with different eyes and noted much to which I paid no\r\nattention at the time. As it was, I was glad to get away from him, for\r\nI could do nothing for him, or chose to say that I could not, and the\r\nsight of so much suffering was painful to me. A man should not only\r\nhave his own way as far as possible, but he should only consort with\r\nthings that are getting their own way so far that they are at any rate\r\ncomfortable. Unless for short times under exceptional circumstances, he\r\nshould not even see things that have been stunted or starved, much less\r\nshould he eat meat that has been vexed by having been over-driven or\r\nunderfed, or afflicted with any disease; nor should he touch vegetables\r\nthat have not been well grown. For all these things cross a man;\r\nwhatever a man comes in contact with in any way forms a cross with him\r\nwhich will leave him better or worse, and the better things he is\r\ncrossed with the more likely he is to live long and happily. All things\r\nmust be crossed a little or they would cease to live\xe2\x80\x94but holy things,\r\nsuch for example as Giovanni Bellini\xe2\x80\x99s saints, have been crossed with\r\nnothing but what is good of its kind,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe storm which I have described in the previous chapter was a sample\r\nof those that occurred daily for many years. No matter how clear the\r\nsky, it was always liable to cloud over now in one quarter now in\r\nanother, and the thunder and lightning were upon the young people\r\nbefore they knew where they were.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ernest to me, when I asked him not long\r\nsince to give me more of his childish reminiscences for the benefit of\r\nmy story, \xe2\x80\x9cwe used to learn Mrs Barbauld\xe2\x80\x99s hymns; they were in prose,\r\nand there was one about the lion which began, \xe2\x80\x98Come, and I will show\r\nyou what is strong. The lion is strong; when he raiseth himself from\r\nhis lair, when he shaketh his mane, when the voice of his roaring is\r\nheard the cattle of the field fly, and the beasts of the desert hide\r\nthemselves, for he is very terrible.\xe2\x80\x99 I used to say this to Joey and\r\nCharlotte about my father himself when I got a little older, but they\r\nwere always didactic, and said it was naughty of me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne great reason why clergymen\xe2\x80\x99s households are generally unhappy is\r\nbecause the clergyman is so much at home or close about the house. The\r\ndoctor is out visiting patients half his time: the lawyer and the\r\nmerchant have offices away from home, but the clergyman has no official\r\nplace of business which shall ensure his being away from home for many\r\nhours together at stated times. Our great days were when my father went\r\nfor a day\xe2\x80\x99s shopping to Gildenham. We were some miles from this place,\r\nand commissions used to accumulate on my father\xe2\x80\x99s list till he would\r\nmake a day of it and go and do the lot. As soon as his back was turned\r\nthe air felt lighter; as soon as the hall door opened to let him in\r\nagain, the law with its all-reaching \xe2\x80\x98touch not, taste not, handle not\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwas upon us again. The worst of it was that I could never trust Joey\r\nand Charlotte; they would go a good way with me and then turn back, or\r\neven the whole way and then their consciences would compel them to tell\r\npapa and mamma. They liked running with the hare up to a certain point,\r\nbut their instinct was towards the hounds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the family is a survival of the\r\nprinciple which is more logically embodied in the compound animal\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthe compound animal is a form of life which has been found incompatible\r\nwith high development. I would do with the family among mankind what\r\nnature has done with the compound animal, and confine it to the lower\r\nand less progressive races. Certainly there is no inherent love for the\r\nfamily system on the part of nature herself. Poll the forms of life and\r\nyou will find it in a ridiculously small minority. The fishes know it\r\nnot, and they get along quite nicely. The ants and the bees, who far\r\noutnumber man, sting their fathers to death as a matter of course, and\r\nare given to the atrocious mutilation of nine-tenths of the offspring\r\ncommitted to their charge, yet where shall we find communities more\r\nuniversally respected? Take the cuckoo again\xe2\x80\x94is there any bird which we\r\nlike better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw he was running off from his own reminiscences and tried to bring\r\nhim back to them, but it was no use.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fool,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ca man is to remember anything that happened\r\nmore than a week ago unless it was pleasant, or unless he wants to make\r\nsome use of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSensible people get the greater part of their own dying done during\r\ntheir own lifetime. A man at five and thirty should no more regret not\r\nhaving had a happier childhood than he should regret not having been\r\nborn a prince of the blood. He might be happier if he had been more\r\nfortunate in childhood, but, for aught he knows, if he had, something\r\nelse might have happened which might have killed him long ago. If I had\r\nto be born again I would be born at Battersby of the same father and\r\nmother as before, and I would not alter anything that has ever happened\r\nto me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe most amusing incident that I can remember about his childhood was\r\nthat when he was about seven years old he told me he was going to have\r\na natural child. I asked him his reasons for thinking this, and he\r\nexplained that papa and mamma had always told him that nobody had\r\nchildren till they were married, and as long as he had believed this of\r\ncourse he had had no idea of having a child, till he was grown up; but\r\nnot long since he had been reading Mrs Markham\xe2\x80\x99s history of England and\r\nhad come upon the words \xe2\x80\x9cJohn of Gaunt had several natural children\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nhad therefore asked his governess what a natural child was\xe2\x80\x94were not all\r\nchildren natural?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9ca natural child is a child a person has\r\nbefore he is married.\xe2\x80\x9d On this it seemed to follow logically that if\r\nJohn of Gaunt had had children before he was married, he, Ernest\r\nPontifex, might have them also, and he would be obliged to me if I\r\nwould tell him what he had better do under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nI enquired how long ago he had made this discovery. He said about a\r\nfortnight, and he did not know where to look for the child, for it\r\nmight come at any moment. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbabies come so\r\nsuddenly; one goes to bed one night and next morning there is a baby.\r\nWhy, it might die of cold if we are not on the look-out for it. I hope\r\nit will be a boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have told your governess about this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but she puts me off and does not help me: she says it will not\r\ncome for many years, and she hopes not then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you quite sure that you have not made any mistake in all this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no; because Mrs Burne, you know, called here a few days ago, and I\r\nwas sent for to be looked at. And mamma held me out at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98Is he Mr Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s child, Mrs Burne, or is he mine?\xe2\x80\x99 Of course,\r\nshe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have said this if papa had not had some of the children\r\nhimself. I did think the gentleman had all the boys and the lady all\r\nthe girls; but it can\xe2\x80\x99t be like this, or else mamma would not have\r\nasked Mrs Burne to guess; but then Mrs Burne said, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, he\xe2\x80\x99s Mr\r\nPontifex\xe2\x80\x99s child _of course_,\xe2\x80\x99 and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite know what she meant\r\nby saying \xe2\x80\x98of course\xe2\x80\x99: it seemed as though I was right in thinking that\r\nthe husband has all the boys and the wife all the girls; I wish you\r\nwould explain to me all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis I could hardly do, so I changed the conversation, after reassuring\r\nhim as best I could.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n\r\nThree or four years after the birth of her daughter, Christina had had\r\none more child. She had never been strong since she married, and had a\r\npresentiment that she should not survive this last confinement. She\r\naccordingly wrote the following letter, which was to be given, as she\r\nendorsed upon it, to her sons when Ernest was sixteen years old. It\r\nreached him on his mother\xe2\x80\x99s death many years later, for it was the baby\r\nwho died now, and not Christina. It was found among papers which she\r\nhad repeatedly and carefully arranged, with the seal already broken.\r\nThis, I am afraid, shows that Christina had read it and thought it too\r\ncreditable to be destroyed when the occasion that had called it forth\r\nhad gone by. It is as follows\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBATTERSBY, _March_ 15th, 1841.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Two Dear Boys,\xe2\x80\x94When this is put into your hands will you try to\r\nbring to mind the mother whom you lost in your childhood, and whom, I\r\nfear, you will almost have forgotten? You, Ernest, will remember her\r\nbest, for you are past five years old, and the many, many times that\r\nshe has taught you your prayers and hymns and sums and told you\r\nstories, and our happy Sunday evenings will not quite have passed from\r\nyour mind, and you, Joey, though only four, will perhaps recollect some\r\nof these things. My dear, dear boys, for the sake of that mother who\r\nloved you very dearly\xe2\x80\x94and for the sake of your own happiness for ever\r\nand ever\xe2\x80\x94attend to and try to remember, and from time to time read over\r\nagain the last words she can ever speak to you. When I think about\r\nleaving you all, two things press heavily upon me: one, your father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsorrow (for you, my darlings, after missing me a little while, will\r\nsoon forget your loss), the other, the everlasting welfare of my\r\nchildren. I know how long and deep the former will be, and I know that\r\nhe will look to his children to be almost his only earthly comfort. You\r\nknow (for I am certain that it will have been so), how he has devoted\r\nhis life to you and taught you and laboured to lead you to all that is\r\nright and good. Oh, then, be sure that you _are_ his comforts. Let him\r\nfind you obedient, affectionate and attentive to his wishes, upright,\r\nself-denying and diligent; let him never blush for or grieve over the\r\nsins and follies of those who owe him such a debt of gratitude, and\r\nwhose first duty it is to study his happiness. You have both of you a\r\nname which must not be disgraced, a father and a grandfather of whom to\r\nshow yourselves worthy; your respectability and well-doing in life rest\r\nmainly with yourselves, but far, far beyond earthly respectability and\r\nwell-doing, and compared with which they are as nothing, your eternal\r\nhappiness rests with yourselves. You know your duty, but snares and\r\ntemptations from without beset you, and the nearer you approach to\r\nmanhood the more strongly will you feel this. With God\xe2\x80\x99s help, with\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s word, and with humble hearts you will stand in spite of\r\neverything, but should you leave off seeking in earnest for the first,\r\nand applying to the second, should you learn to trust in yourselves, or\r\nto the advice and example of too many around you, you will, you must\r\nfall. Oh, \xe2\x80\x98let God be true and every man a liar.\xe2\x80\x99 He says you cannot\r\nserve Him and Mammon. He says that strait is the gate that leads to\r\neternal life. Many there are who seek to widen it; they will tell you\r\nthat such and such self-indulgences are but venial offences\xe2\x80\x94that this\r\nand that worldly compliance is excusable and even necessary. The thing\r\n_cannot be_; for in a hundred and a hundred places He tells you so\xe2\x80\x94look\r\nto your Bibles and seek there whether such counsel is true\xe2\x80\x94and if not,\r\noh, \xe2\x80\x98halt not between two opinions,\xe2\x80\x99 if God is the Lord follow Him;\r\nonly be strong and of a good courage, and He will never leave you nor\r\nforsake you. Remember, there is not in the Bible one law for the rich,\r\nand one for the poor\xe2\x80\x94one for the educated and one for the ignorant. To\r\n_all_ there is but one thing needful. _All_ are to be living to God and\r\ntheir fellow-creatures, and not to themselves. _All_ must seek first\r\nthe Kingdom of God and His righteousness\xe2\x80\x94must _deny themselves_, be\r\npure and chaste and charitable in the fullest and widest sense\xe2\x80\x94all,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98forgetting those things that are behind,\xe2\x80\x99 must \xe2\x80\x98press forward towards\r\nthe mark, for the prize of the high calling of God.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now I will add but two things more. Be true through life to each\r\nother, love as only brothers should do, strengthen, warn, encourage one\r\nanother, and let who will be against you, let each feel that in his\r\nbrother he has a firm and faithful friend who will be so to the end;\r\nand, oh! be kind and watchful over your dear sister; without mother or\r\nsisters she will doubly need her brothers\xe2\x80\x99 love and tenderness and\r\nconfidence. I am certain she will seek them, and will love you and try\r\nto make you happy; be sure then that you do not fail her, and remember,\r\nthat were she to lose her father and remain unmarried, she would doubly\r\nneed protectors. To you, then, I especially commend her. Oh! my three\r\ndarling children, be true to each other, your Father, and your God. May\r\nHe guide and bless you, and grant that in a better and happier world I\r\nand mine may meet again.\xe2\x80\x94Your most affectionate mother,\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTINA PONTIFEX.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom enquiries I have made, I have satisfied myself that most mothers\r\nwrite letters like this shortly before their confinements, and that\r\nfifty per cent. keep them afterwards, as Christina did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing letter shows how much greater was Christina\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety for\r\nthe eternal than for the temporal welfare of her sons. One would have\r\nthought she had sowed enough of such religious wild oats by this time,\r\nbut she had plenty still to sow. To me it seems that those who are\r\nhappy in this world are better and more lovable people than those who\r\nare not, and that thus in the event of a Resurrection and Day of\r\nJudgement, they will be the most likely to be deemed worthy of a\r\nheavenly mansion. Perhaps a dim unconscious perception of this was the\r\nreason why Christina was so anxious for Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s earthly happiness,\r\nor was it merely due to a conviction that his eternal welfare was so\r\nmuch a matter of course, that it only remained to secure his earthly\r\nhappiness? He was to \xe2\x80\x9cfind his sons obedient, affectionate, attentive\r\nto his wishes, self-denying and diligent,\xe2\x80\x9d a goodly string forsooth of\r\nall the virtues most convenient to parents; he was never to have to\r\nblush for the follies of those \xe2\x80\x9cwho owed him such a debt of gratitude,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9cwhose first duty it was to study his happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d How like maternal\r\nsolicitude is this! Solicitude for the most part lest the offspring\r\nshould come to have wishes and feelings of its own, which may occasion\r\nmany difficulties, fancied or real. It is this that is at the bottom of\r\nthe whole mischief; but whether this last proposition is granted or no,\r\nat any rate we observe that Christina had a sufficiently keen\r\nappreciation of the duties of children towards their parents, and felt\r\nthe task of fulfilling them adequately to be so difficult that she was\r\nvery doubtful how far Ernest and Joey would succeed in mastering it. It\r\nis plain in fact that her supposed parting glance upon them was one of\r\nsuspicion. But there was no suspicion of Theobald; that he should have\r\ndevoted his life to his children\xe2\x80\x94why this was such a mere platitude, as\r\nalmost to go without saying.\r\n\r\nHow, let me ask, was it possible that a child only a little past five\r\nyears old, trained in such an atmosphere of prayers and hymns and sums\r\nand happy Sunday evenings\xe2\x80\x94to say nothing of daily repeated beatings\r\nover the said prayers and hymns, etc., about which our authoress is\r\nsilent\xe2\x80\x94how was it possible that a lad so trained should grow up in any\r\nhealthy or vigorous development, even though in her own way his mother\r\nwas undoubtedly very fond of him, and sometimes told him stories? Can\r\nthe eye of any reader fail to detect the coming wrath of God as about\r\nto descend upon the head of him who should be nurtured under the shadow\r\nof such a letter as the foregoing?\r\n\r\nI have often thought that the Church of Rome does wisely in not\r\nallowing her priests to marry. Certainly it is a matter of common\r\nobservation in England that the sons of clergymen are frequently\r\nunsatisfactory. The explanation is very simple, but is so often lost\r\nsight of that I may perhaps be pardoned for giving it here.\r\n\r\nThe clergyman is expected to be a kind of human Sunday. Things must not\r\nbe done in him which are venial in the week-day classes. He is paid for\r\nthis business of leading a stricter life than other people. It is his\r\n_raison d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xaatre_. If his parishioners feel that he does this, they\r\napprove of him, for they look upon him as their own contribution\r\ntowards what they deem a holy life. This is why the clergyman is so\r\noften called a vicar\xe2\x80\x94he being the person whose vicarious goodness is to\r\nstand for that of those entrusted to his charge. But his home is his\r\ncastle as much as that of any other Englishman, and with him, as with\r\nothers, unnatural tension in public is followed by exhaustion when\r\ntension is no longer necessary. His children are the most defenceless\r\nthings he can reach, and it is on them in nine cases out of ten that he\r\nwill relieve his mind.\r\n\r\nA clergyman, again, can hardly ever allow himself to look facts fairly\r\nin the face. It is his profession to support one side; it is\r\nimpossible, therefore, for him to make an unbiassed examination of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nWe forget that every clergyman with a living or curacy, is as much a\r\npaid advocate as the barrister who is trying to persuade a jury to\r\nacquit a prisoner. We should listen to him with the same suspense of\r\njudgment, the same full consideration of the arguments of the opposing\r\ncounsel, as a judge does when he is trying a case. Unless we know\r\nthese, and can state them in a way that our opponents would admit to be\r\na fair representation of their views, we have no right to claim that we\r\nhave formed an opinion at all. The misfortune is that by the law of the\r\nland one side only can be heard.\r\n\r\nTheobald and Christina were no exceptions to the general rule. When\r\nthey came to Battersby they had every desire to fulfil the duties of\r\ntheir position, and to devote themselves to the honour and glory of\r\nGod. But it was Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s duty to see the honour and glory of God\r\nthrough the eyes of a Church which had lived three hundred years\r\nwithout finding reason to change a single one of its opinions.\r\n\r\nI should doubt whether he ever got as far as doubting the wisdom of his\r\nChurch upon any single matter. His scent for possible mischief was\r\ntolerably keen; so was Christina\xe2\x80\x99s, and it is likely that if either of\r\nthem detected in him or herself the first faint symptoms of a want of\r\nfaith they were nipped no less peremptorily in the bud, than signs of\r\nself-will in Ernest were\xe2\x80\x94and I should imagine more successfully. Yet\r\nTheobald considered himself, and was generally considered to be, and\r\nindeed perhaps was, an exceptionally truthful person; indeed he was\r\ngenerally looked upon as an embodiment of all those virtues which make\r\nthe poor respectable and the rich respected. In the course of time he\r\nand his wife became persuaded even to unconsciousness, that no one\r\ncould even dwell under their roof without deep cause for thankfulness.\r\nTheir children, their servants, their parishioners must be fortunate\r\n_ipso facto_ that they were theirs. There was no road to happiness here\r\nor hereafter, but the road that they had themselves travelled, no good\r\npeople who did not think as they did upon every subject, and no\r\nreasonable person who had wants the gratification of which would be\r\ninconvenient to them\xe2\x80\x94Theobald and Christina.\r\n\r\nThis was how it came to pass that their children were white and puny;\r\nthey were suffering from _home-sickness_. They were starving, through\r\nbeing over-crammed with the wrong things. Nature came down upon them,\r\nbut she did not come down on Theobald and Christina. Why should she?\r\nThey were not leading a starved existence. There are two classes of\r\npeople in this world, those who sin, and those who are sinned against;\r\nif a man must belong to either, he had better belong to the first than\r\nto the second.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nI will give no more of the details of my hero\xe2\x80\x99s earlier years. Enough\r\nthat he struggled through them, and at twelve years old knew every page\r\nof his Latin and Greek Grammars by heart. He had read the greater part\r\nof Virgil, Horace and Livy, and I do not know how many Greek plays: he\r\nwas proficient in arithmetic, knew the first four books of Euclid\r\nthoroughly, and had a fair knowledge of French. It was now time he went\r\nto school, and to school he was accordingly to go, under the famous Dr\r\nSkinner of Roughborough.\r\n\r\nTheobald had known Dr Skinner slightly at Cambridge. He had been a\r\nburning and a shining light in every position he had filled from his\r\nboyhood upwards. He was a very great genius. Everyone knew this; they\r\nsaid, indeed, that he was one of the few people to whom the word genius\r\ncould be applied without exaggeration. Had he not taken I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nhow many University Scholarships in his freshman\xe2\x80\x99s year? Had he not\r\nbeen afterwards Senior Wrangler, First Chancellor\xe2\x80\x99s Medallist and I do\r\nnot know how many more things besides? And then, he was such a\r\nwonderful speaker; at the Union Debating Club he had been without a\r\nrival, and had, of course, been president; his moral character,\xe2\x80\x94a point\r\non which so many geniuses were weak\xe2\x80\x94was absolutely irreproachable;\r\nforemost of all, however, among his many great qualities, and perhaps\r\nmore remarkable even than his genius was what biographers have called\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe simple-minded and child-like earnestness of his character,\xe2\x80\x9d an\r\nearnestness which might be perceived by the solemnity with which he\r\nspoke even about trifles. It is hardly necessary to say he was on the\r\nLiberal side in politics.\r\n\r\nHis personal appearance was not particularly prepossessing. He was\r\nabout the middle height, portly, and had a couple of fierce grey eyes,\r\nthat flashed fire from beneath a pair of great bushy beetling eyebrows\r\nand overawed all who came near him. It was in respect of his personal\r\nappearance, however, that, if he was vulnerable at all, his weak place\r\nwas to be found. His hair when he was a young man was red, but after he\r\nhad taken his degree he had a brain fever which caused him to have his\r\nhead shaved; when he reappeared, he did so wearing a wig, and one which\r\nwas a good deal further off red than his own hair had been. He not only\r\nhad never discarded his wig, but year by year it had edged itself a\r\nlittle more and a little more off red, till by the time he was forty,\r\nthere was not a trace of red remaining, and his wig was brown.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr Skinner was a very young man, hardly more than five-and-twenty,\r\nthe head-mastership of Roughborough Grammar School had fallen vacant,\r\nand he had been unhesitatingly appointed. The result justified the\r\nselection. Dr Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s pupils distinguished themselves at whichever\r\nUniversity they went to. He moulded their minds after the model of his\r\nown, and stamped an impression upon them which was indelible in\r\nafter-life; whatever else a Roughborough man might be, he was sure to\r\nmake everyone feel that he was a God-fearing earnest Christian and a\r\nLiberal, if not a Radical, in politics. Some boys, of course, were\r\nincapable of appreciating the beauty and loftiness of Dr Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnature. Some such boys, alas! there will be in every school; upon them\r\nDr Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s hand was very properly a heavy one. His hand was against\r\nthem, and theirs against him during the whole time of the connection\r\nbetween them. They not only disliked him, but they hated all that he\r\nmore especially embodied, and throughout their lives disliked all that\r\nreminded them of him. Such boys, however, were in a minority, the\r\nspirit of the place being decidedly Skinnerian.\r\n\r\nI once had the honour of playing a game of chess with this great man.\r\nIt was during the Christmas holidays, and I had come down to\r\nRoughborough for a few days to see Alethea Pontifex (who was then\r\nliving there) on business. It was very gracious of him to take notice\r\nof me, for if I was a light of literature at all it was of the very\r\nlightest kind.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in the intervals of business I had written a good deal,\r\nbut my works had been almost exclusively for the stage, and for those\r\ntheatres that devoted themselves to extravaganza and burlesque. I had\r\nwritten many pieces of this description, full of puns and comic songs,\r\nand they had had a fair success, but my best piece had been a treatment\r\nof English history during the Reformation period, in the course of\r\nwhich I had introduced Cranmer, Sir Thomas More, Henry the Eighth,\r\nCatherine of Arragon, and Thomas Cromwell (in his youth better known as\r\nthe _Malleus Monachorum_), and had made them dance a break-down. I had\r\nalso dramatised \xe2\x80\x9cThe Pilgrim\xe2\x80\x99s Progress\xe2\x80\x9d for a Christmas Pantomime, and\r\nmade an important scene of Vanity Fair, with Mr Greatheart, Apollyon,\r\nChristiana, Mercy, and Hopeful as the principal characters. The\r\norchestra played music taken from Handel\xe2\x80\x99s best known works, but the\r\ntime was a good deal altered, and altogether the tunes were not exactly\r\nas Handel left them. Mr Greatheart was very stout and he had a red\r\nnose; he wore a capacious waistcoat, and a shirt with a huge frill down\r\nthe middle of the front. Hopeful was up to as much mischief as I could\r\ngive him; he wore the costume of a young swell of the period, and had a\r\ncigar in his mouth which was continually going out.\r\n\r\nChristiana did not wear much of anything: indeed it was said that the\r\ndress which the Stage Manager had originally proposed for her had been\r\nconsidered inadequate even by the Lord Chamberlain, but this is not the\r\ncase. With all these delinquencies upon my mind it was natural that I\r\nshould feel convinced of sin while playing chess (which I hate) with\r\nthe great Dr Skinner of Roughborough\xe2\x80\x94the historian of Athens and editor\r\nof Demosthenes. Dr Skinner, moreover, was one of those who pride\r\nthemselves on being able to set people at their ease at once, and I had\r\nbeen sitting on the edge of my chair all the evening. But I have always\r\nbeen very easily overawed by a schoolmaster.\r\n\r\nThe game had been a long one, and at half-past nine, when supper came\r\nin, we had each of us a few pieces remaining. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you take for\r\nsupper, Dr Skinner?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Skinner in a silvery voice.\r\n\r\nHe made no answer for some time, but at last in a tone of almost\r\nsuperhuman solemnity, he said, first, \xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d and then \xe2\x80\x9cNothing\r\nwhatever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy and by, however, I had a sense come over me as though I were nearer\r\nthe consummation of all things than I had ever yet been. The room\r\nseemed to grow dark, as an expression came over Dr Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s face,\r\nwhich showed that he was about to speak. The expression gathered force,\r\nthe room grew darker and darker. \xe2\x80\x9cStay,\xe2\x80\x9d he at length added, and I felt\r\nthat here at any rate was an end to a suspense which was rapidly\r\nbecoming unbearable. \xe2\x80\x9cStay\xe2\x80\x94I may presently take a glass of cold\r\nwater\xe2\x80\x94and a small piece of bread and butter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he said the word \xe2\x80\x9cbutter\xe2\x80\x9d his voice sank to a hardly audible\r\nwhisper; then there was a sigh as though of relief when the sentence\r\nwas concluded, and the universe this time was safe.\r\n\r\nAnother ten minutes of solemn silence finished the game. The Doctor\r\nrose briskly from his seat and placed himself at the supper table. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs\r\nSkinner,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed jauntily, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat are those mysterious-looking\r\nobjects surrounded by potatoes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose are oysters, Dr Skinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me some, and give Overton some.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so on till he had eaten a good plate of oysters, a scallop shell of\r\nminced veal nicely browned, some apple tart, and a hunk of bread and\r\ncheese. This was the small piece of bread and butter.\r\n\r\nThe cloth was now removed and tumblers with teaspoons in them, a lemon\r\nor two and a jug of boiling water were placed upon the table. Then the\r\ngreat man unbent. His face beamed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what shall it be to drink?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed persuasively. \xe2\x80\x9cShall it\r\nbe brandy and water? No. It shall be gin and water. Gin is the more\r\nwholesome liquor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo gin it was, hot and stiff too.\r\n\r\nWho can wonder at him or do anything but pity him? Was he not\r\nhead-master of Roughborough School? To whom had he owed money at any\r\ntime? Whose ox had he taken, whose ass had he taken, or whom had he\r\ndefrauded? What whisper had ever been breathed against his moral\r\ncharacter? If he had become rich it was by the most honourable of all\r\nmeans\xe2\x80\x94his literary attainments; over and above his great works of\r\nscholarship, his \xe2\x80\x9cMeditations upon the Epistle and Character of St\r\nJude\xe2\x80\x9d had placed him among the most popular of English theologians; it\r\nwas so exhaustive that no one who bought it need ever meditate upon the\r\nsubject again\xe2\x80\x94indeed it exhausted all who had anything to do with it.\r\nHe had made \xc2\xa35000 by this work alone, and would very likely make\r\nanother \xc2\xa35000 before he died. A man who had done all this and wanted a\r\npiece of bread and butter had a right to announce the fact with some\r\npomp and circumstance. Nor should his words be taken without searching\r\nfor what he used to call a \xe2\x80\x9cdeeper and more hidden meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d Those who\r\nsearched for this even in his lightest utterances would not be without\r\ntheir reward. They would find that \xe2\x80\x9cbread and butter\xe2\x80\x9d was Skinnerese\r\nfor oyster-patties and apple tart, and \xe2\x80\x9cgin hot\xe2\x80\x9d the true translation\r\nof water.\r\n\r\nBut independently of their money value, his works had made him a\r\nlasting name in literature. So probably Gallio was under the impression\r\nthat his fame would rest upon the treatises on natural history which we\r\ngather from Seneca that he compiled, and which for aught we know may\r\nhave contained a complete theory of evolution; but the treatises are\r\nall gone and Gallio has become immortal for the very last reason in the\r\nworld that he expected, and for the very last reason that would have\r\nflattered his vanity. He has become immortal because he cared nothing\r\nabout the most important movement with which he was ever brought into\r\nconnection (I wish people who are in search of immortality would lay\r\nthe lesson to heart and not make so much noise about important\r\nmovements), and so, if Dr Skinner becomes immortal, it will probably be\r\nfor some reason very different from the one which he so fondly\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\nCould it be expected to enter into the head of such a man as this that\r\nin reality he was making his money by corrupting youth; that it was his\r\npaid profession to make the worse appear the better reason in the eyes\r\nof those who were too young and inexperienced to be able to find him\r\nout; that he kept out of the sight of those whom he professed to teach\r\nmaterial points of the argument, for the production of which they had a\r\nright to rely upon the honour of anyone who made professions of\r\nsincerity; that he was a passionate half-turkey-cock half-gander of a\r\nman whose sallow, bilious face and hobble-gobble voice could scare the\r\ntimid, but who would take to his heels readily enough if he were met\r\nfirmly; that his \xe2\x80\x9cMeditations on St Jude,\xe2\x80\x9d such as they were, were\r\ncribbed without acknowledgment, and would have been beneath contempt if\r\nso many people did not believe them to have been written honestly? Mrs\r\nSkinner might have perhaps kept him a little more in his proper place\r\nif she had thought it worth while to try, but she had enough to attend\r\nto in looking after her household and seeing that the boys were well\r\nfed and, if they were ill, properly looked after\xe2\x80\x94which she took good\r\ncare they were.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nErnest had heard awful accounts of Dr Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s temper, and of the\r\nbullying which the younger boys at Roughborough had to put up with at\r\nthe hands of the bigger ones. He had now got about as much as he could\r\nstand, and felt as though it must go hard with him if his burdens of\r\nwhatever kind were to be increased. He did not cry on leaving home, but\r\nI am afraid he did on being told that he was getting near Roughborough.\r\nHis father and mother were with him, having posted from home in their\r\nown carriage; Roughborough had as yet no railway, and as it was only\r\nsome forty miles from Battersby, this was the easiest way of getting\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nOn seeing him cry, his mother felt flattered and caressed him. She said\r\nshe knew he must feel very sad at leaving such a happy home, and going\r\namong people who, though they would be very good to him, could never,\r\nnever be as good as his dear papa and she had been; still, she was\r\nherself, if he only knew it, much more deserving of pity than he was,\r\nfor the parting was more painful to her than it could possibly be to\r\nhim, etc., and Ernest, on being told that his tears were for grief at\r\nleaving home, took it all on trust, and did not trouble to investigate\r\nthe real cause of his tears. As they approached Roughborough he pulled\r\nhimself together, and was fairly calm by the time he reached Dr\r\nSkinner\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nOn their arrival they had luncheon with the Doctor and his wife, and\r\nthen Mrs Skinner took Christina over the bedrooms, and showed her where\r\nher dear little boy was to sleep.\r\n\r\nWhatever men may think about the study of man, women do really believe\r\nthe noblest study for womankind to be woman, and Christina was too much\r\nengrossed with Mrs Skinner to pay much attention to anything else; I\r\ndaresay Mrs Skinner, too, was taking pretty accurate stock of\r\nChristina. Christina was charmed, as indeed she generally was with any\r\nnew acquaintance, for she found in them (and so must we all) something\r\nof the nature of a cross; as for Mrs Skinner, I imagine she had seen\r\ntoo many Christinas to find much regeneration in the sample now before\r\nher; I believe her private opinion echoed the dictum of a well-known\r\nhead-master who declared that all parents were fools, but more\r\nespecially mothers; she was, however, all smiles and sweetness, and\r\nChristina devoured these graciously as tributes paid more particularly\r\nto herself, and such as no other mother would have been at all likely\r\nto have won.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Theobald and Ernest were with Dr Skinner in his\r\nlibrary\xe2\x80\x94the room where new boys were examined and old ones had up for\r\nrebuke or chastisement. If the walls of that room could speak, what an\r\namount of blundering and capricious cruelty would they not bear witness\r\nto!\r\n\r\nLike all houses, Dr Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s had its peculiar smell. In this case the\r\nprevailing odour was one of Russia leather, but along with it there was\r\na subordinate savour as of a chemist\xe2\x80\x99s shop. This came from a small\r\nlaboratory in one corner of the room\xe2\x80\x94the possession of which, together\r\nwith the free chattery and smattery use of such words as \xe2\x80\x9ccarbonate,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chyposulphite,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cphosphate,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9caffinity,\xe2\x80\x9d were enough to convince\r\neven the most sceptical that Dr Skinner had a profound knowledge of\r\nchemistry.\r\n\r\nI may say in passing that Dr Skinner had dabbled in a great many other\r\nthings as well as chemistry. He was a man of many small knowledges, and\r\neach of them dangerous. I remember Alethea Pontifex once said in her\r\nwicked way to me, that Dr Skinner put her in mind of the Bourbon\r\nprinces on their return from exile after the battle of Waterloo, only\r\nthat he was their exact converse; for whereas they had learned nothing\r\nand forgotten nothing, Dr Skinner had learned everything and forgotten\r\neverything. And this puts me in mind of another of her wicked sayings\r\nabout Dr Skinner. She told me one day that he had the harmlessness of\r\nthe serpent and the wisdom of the dove.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Dr Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s library; over the chimney-piece there was\r\na Bishop\xe2\x80\x99s half length portrait of Dr Skinner himself, painted by the\r\nelder Pickersgill, whose merit Dr Skinner had been among the first to\r\ndiscern and foster. There were no other pictures in the library, but in\r\nthe dining-room there was a fine collection, which the doctor had got\r\ntogether with his usual consummate taste. He added to it largely in\r\nlater life, and when it came to the hammer at Christie\xe2\x80\x99s, as it did not\r\nlong since, it was found to comprise many of the latest and most\r\nmatured works of Solomon Hart, O\xe2\x80\x99Neil, Charles Landseer, and more of\r\nour recent Academicians than I can at the moment remember. There were\r\nthus brought together and exhibited at one view many works which had\r\nattracted attention at the Academy Exhibitions, and as to whose\r\nultimate destiny there had been some curiosity. The prices realised\r\nwere disappointing to the executors, but, then, these things are so\r\nmuch a matter of chance. An unscrupulous writer in a well-known weekly\r\npaper had written the collection down. Moreover there had been one or\r\ntwo large sales a short time before Dr Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s, so that at this last\r\nthere was rather a panic, and a reaction against the high prices that\r\nhad ruled lately.\r\n\r\nThe table of the library was loaded with books many deep; MSS. of all\r\nkinds were confusedly mixed up with them,\xe2\x80\x94boys\xe2\x80\x99 exercises, probably,\r\nand examination papers\xe2\x80\x94but all littering untidily about. The room in\r\nfact was as depressing from its slatternliness as from its atmosphere\r\nof erudition. Theobald and Ernest as they entered it, stumbled over a\r\nlarge hole in the Turkey carpet, and the dust that rose showed how long\r\nit was since it had been taken up and beaten. This, I should say, was\r\nno fault of Mrs Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s but was due to the Doctor himself, who\r\ndeclared that if his papers were once disturbed it would be the death\r\nof him. Near the window was a green cage containing a pair of turtle\r\ndoves, whose plaintive cooing added to the melancholy of the place. The\r\nwalls were covered with book shelves from floor to ceiling, and on\r\nevery shelf the books stood in double rows. It was horrible. Prominent\r\namong the most prominent upon the most prominent shelf were a series of\r\nsplendidly bound volumes entitled \xe2\x80\x9cSkinner\xe2\x80\x99s Works.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoys are sadly apt to rush to conclusions, and Ernest believed that Dr\r\nSkinner knew all the books in this terrible library, and that he, if he\r\nwere to be any good, should have to learn them too. His heart fainted\r\nwithin him.\r\n\r\nHe was told to sit on a chair against the wall and did so, while Dr\r\nSkinner talked to Theobald upon the topics of the day. He talked about\r\nthe Hampden Controversy then raging, and discoursed learnedly about\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPraemunire\xe2\x80\x9d; then he talked about the revolution which had just broken\r\nout in Sicily, and rejoiced that the Pope had refused to allow foreign\r\ntroops to pass through his dominions in order to crush it. Dr Skinner\r\nand the other masters took in the Times among them, and Dr Skinner\r\nechoed the _Times_\xe2\x80\x99 leaders. In those days there were no penny papers\r\nand Theobald only took in the _Spectator_\xe2\x80\x94for he was at that time on\r\nthe Whig side in politics; besides this he used to receive the\r\n_Ecclesiastical Gazette_ once a month, but he saw no other papers, and\r\nwas amazed at the ease and fluency with which Dr Skinner ran from\r\nsubject to subject.\r\n\r\nThe Pope\xe2\x80\x99s action in the matter of the Sicilian revolution naturally\r\nled the Doctor to the reforms which his Holiness had introduced into\r\nhis dominions, and he laughed consumedly over the joke which had not\r\nlong since appeared in _Punch_, to the effect that Pio \xe2\x80\x9cNo, No,\xe2\x80\x9d should\r\nrather have been named Pio \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d because, as the doctor\r\nexplained, he granted everything his subjects asked for. Anything like\r\na pun went straight to Dr Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\r\n\r\nThen he went on to the matter of these reforms themselves. They opened\r\nup a new era in the history of Christendom, and would have such\r\nmomentous and far-reaching consequences, that they might even lead to a\r\nreconciliation between the Churches of England and Rome. Dr Skinner had\r\nlately published a pamphlet upon this subject, which had shown great\r\nlearning, and had attacked the Church of Rome in a way which did not\r\npromise much hope of reconciliation. He had grounded his attack upon\r\nthe letters A.M.D.G., which he had seen outside a Roman Catholic\r\nchapel, and which of course stood for _Ad Mariam Dei Genetricem_. Could\r\nanything be more idolatrous?\r\n\r\nI am told, by the way, that I must have let my memory play me one of\r\nthe tricks it often does play me, when I said the Doctor proposed _Ad\r\nMariam Dei Genetricem_ as the full harmonies, so to speak, which should\r\nbe constructed upon the bass A.M.D.G., for that this is bad Latin, and\r\nthat the doctor really harmonised the letters thus: _Ave Maria Dei\r\nGenetrix_. No doubt the doctor did what was right in the matter of\r\nLatinity\xe2\x80\x94I have forgotten the little Latin I ever knew, and am not\r\ngoing to look the matter up, but I believe the doctor said _Ad Mariam\r\nDei Genetricem_, and if so we may be sure that _Ad Mariam Dei\r\nGenetricem_, is good enough Latin at any rate for ecclesiastical\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe reply of the local priest had not yet appeared, and Dr Skinner was\r\njubilant, but when the answer appeared, and it was solemnly declared\r\nthat A.M.D.G. stood for nothing more dangerous than _Ad Majorem Dei\r\nGloriam_, it was felt that though this subterfuge would not succeed\r\nwith any intelligent Englishman, still it was a pity Dr Skinner had\r\nselected this particular point for his attack, for he had to leave his\r\nenemy in possession of the field. When people are left in possession of\r\nthe field, spectators have an awkward habit of thinking that their\r\nadversary does not dare to come to the scratch.\r\n\r\nDr Skinner was telling Theobald all about his pamphlet, and I doubt\r\nwhether this gentleman was much more comfortable than Ernest himself.\r\nHe was bored, for in his heart he hated Liberalism, though he was\r\nashamed to say so, and, as I have said, professed to be on the Whig\r\nside. He did not want to be reconciled to the Church of Rome; he wanted\r\nto make all Roman Catholics turn Protestants, and could never\r\nunderstand why they would not do so; but the Doctor talked in such a\r\ntruly liberal spirit, and shut him up so sharply when he tried to edge\r\nin a word or two, that he had to let him have it all his own way, and\r\nthis was not what he was accustomed to. He was wondering how he could\r\nbring it to an end, when a diversion was created by the discovery that\r\nErnest had begun to cry\xe2\x80\x94doubtless through an intense but inarticulate\r\nsense of a boredom greater than he could bear. He was evidently in a\r\nhighly nervous state, and a good deal upset by the excitement of the\r\nmorning, Mrs Skinner therefore, who came in with Christina at this\r\njuncture, proposed that he should spend the afternoon with Mrs Jay, the\r\nmatron, and not be introduced to his young companions until the\r\nfollowing morning. His father and mother now bade him an affectionate\r\nfarewell, and the lad was handed over to Mrs Jay.\r\n\r\nO schoolmasters\xe2\x80\x94if any of you read this book\xe2\x80\x94bear in mind when any\r\nparticularly timid drivelling urchin is brought by his papa into your\r\nstudy, and you treat him with the contempt which he deserves, and\r\nafterwards make his life a burden to him for years\xe2\x80\x94bear in mind that it\r\nis exactly in the disguise of such a boy as this that your future\r\nchronicler will appear. Never see a wretched little heavy-eyed mite\r\nsitting on the edge of a chair against your study wall without saying\r\nto yourselves, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps this boy is he who, if I am not careful, will\r\none day tell the world what manner of man I was.\xe2\x80\x9d If even two or three\r\nschoolmasters learn this lesson and remember it, the preceding chapters\r\nwill not have been written in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after his father and mother had left him Ernest dropped asleep\r\nover a book which Mrs Jay had given him, and he did not awake till\r\ndusk. Then he sat down on a stool in front of the fire, which showed\r\npleasantly in the late January twilight, and began to muse. He felt\r\nweak, feeble, ill at ease and unable to see his way out of the\r\ninnumerable troubles that were before him. Perhaps, he said to himself,\r\nhe might even die, but this, far from being an end of his troubles,\r\nwould prove the beginning of new ones; for at the best he would only go\r\nto Grandpapa Pontifex and Grandmamma Allaby, and though they would\r\nperhaps be more easy to get on with than Papa and Mamma, yet they were\r\nundoubtedly not so really good, and were more worldly; moreover they\r\nwere grown-up people\xe2\x80\x94especially Grandpapa Pontifex, who so far as he\r\ncould understand had been very much grown-up, and he did not know why,\r\nbut there was always something that kept him from loving any grown-up\r\npeople very much\xe2\x80\x94except one or two of the servants, who had indeed been\r\nas nice as anything that he could imagine. Besides even if he were to\r\ndie and go to Heaven he supposed he should have to complete his\r\neducation somewhere.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime his father and mother were rolling along the muddy\r\nroads, each in his or her own corner of the carriage, and each\r\nrevolving many things which were and were not to come to pass. Times\r\nhave changed since I last showed them to the reader as sitting together\r\nsilently in a carriage, but except as regards their mutual relations,\r\nthey have altered singularly little. When I was younger I used to think\r\nthe Prayer Book was wrong in requiring us to say the General Confession\r\ntwice a week from childhood to old age, without making provision for\r\nour not being quite such great sinners at seventy as we had been at\r\nseven; granted that we should go to the wash like table-cloths at least\r\nonce a week, still I used to think a day ought to come when we should\r\nwant rather less rubbing and scrubbing at. Now that I have grown older\r\nmyself I have seen that the Church has estimated probabilities better\r\nthan I had done.\r\n\r\nThe pair said not a word to one another, but watched the fading light\r\nand naked trees, the brown fields with here and there a melancholy\r\ncottage by the road side, and the rain that fell fast upon the carriage\r\nwindows. It was a kind of afternoon on which nice people for the most\r\npart like to be snug at home, and Theobald was a little snappish at\r\nreflecting how many miles he had to post before he could be at his own\r\nfireside again. However there was nothing for it, so the pair sat\r\nquietly and watched the roadside objects flit by them, and get greyer\r\nand grimmer as the light faded.\r\n\r\nThough they spoke not to one another, there was one nearer to each of\r\nthem with whom they could converse freely. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said Theobald to\r\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope he\xe2\x80\x99ll work\xe2\x80\x94or else that Skinner will make him. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike Skinner, I never did like him, but he is unquestionably a man of\r\ngenius, and no one turns out so many pupils who succeed at Oxford and\r\nCambridge, and that is the best test. I have done my share towards\r\nstarting him well. Skinner said he had been well grounded and was very\r\nforward. I suppose he will presume upon it now and do nothing, for his\r\nnature is an idle one. He is not fond of me, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he is not. He\r\nought to be after all the trouble I have taken with him, but he is\r\nungrateful and selfish. It is an unnatural thing for a boy not to be\r\nfond of his own father. If he was fond of me I should be fond of him,\r\nbut I cannot like a son who, I am sure, dislikes me. He shrinks out of\r\nmy way whenever he sees me coming near him. He will not stay five\r\nminutes in the same room with me if he can help it. He is deceitful. He\r\nwould not want to hide himself away so much if he were not deceitful.\r\nThat is a bad sign and one which makes me fear he will grow up\r\nextravagant. I am sure he will grow up extravagant. I should have given\r\nhim more pocket-money if I had not known this\xe2\x80\x94but what is the good of\r\ngiving him pocket-money? It is all gone directly. If he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t buy\r\nsomething with it he gives it away to the first little boy or girl he\r\nsees who takes his fancy. He forgets that it\xe2\x80\x99s my money he is giving\r\naway. I give him money that he may have money and learn to know its\r\nuses, not that he may go and squander it immediately. I wish he was not\r\nso fond of music, it will interfere with his Latin and Greek. I will\r\nstop it as much as I can. Why, when he was translating Livy the other\r\nday he slipped out Handel\xe2\x80\x99s name in mistake for Hannibal\xe2\x80\x99s, and his\r\nmother tells me he knows half the tunes in the \xe2\x80\x98Messiah\xe2\x80\x99 by heart. What\r\nshould a boy of his age know about the \xe2\x80\x98Messiah\xe2\x80\x99? If I had shown half\r\nas many dangerous tendencies when I was a boy, my father would have\r\napprenticed me to a greengrocer, of that I\xe2\x80\x99m very sure,\xe2\x80\x9d etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThen his thoughts turned to Egypt and the tenth plague. It seemed to\r\nhim that if the little Egyptians had been anything like Ernest, the\r\nplague must have been something very like a blessing in disguise. If\r\nthe Israelites were to come to England now he should be greatly tempted\r\nnot to let them go.\r\n\r\nMrs Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts ran in a different current. \xe2\x80\x9cLord Lonsford\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrandson\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a pity his name is Figgins; however, blood is blood as\r\nmuch through the female line as the male, indeed, perhaps even more so\r\nif the truth were known. I wonder who Mr Figgins was. I think Mrs\r\nSkinner said he was dead, however, I must find out all about him. It\r\nwould be delightful if young Figgins were to ask Ernest home for the\r\nholidays. Who knows but he might meet Lord Lonsford himself, or at any\r\nrate some of Lord Lonsford\xe2\x80\x99s other descendants?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the boy himself was still sitting moodily before the fire in\r\nMrs Jay\xe2\x80\x99s room. \xe2\x80\x9cPapa and Mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d he was saying to himself, \xe2\x80\x9care much\r\nbetter and cleverer than anyone else, but, I, alas! shall never be\r\neither good or clever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Pontifex continued\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it would be best to get young Figgins on a visit to ourselves\r\nfirst. That would be charming. Theobald would not like it, for he does\r\nnot like children; I must see how I can manage it, for it would be so\r\nnice to have young Figgins\xe2\x80\x94or stay! Ernest shall go and stay with\r\nFiggins and meet the future Lord Lonsford, who I should think must be\r\nabout Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s age, and then if he and Ernest were to become friends\r\nErnest might ask him to Battersby, and he might fall in love with\r\nCharlotte. I think we have done _most wisely_ in sending Ernest to Dr\r\nSkinner\xe2\x80\x99s. Dr Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s piety is no less remarkable than his genius.\r\nOne can tell these things at a glance, and he must have felt it about\r\nme no less strongly than I about him. I think he seemed much struck\r\nwith Theobald and myself\xe2\x80\x94indeed, Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s intellectual power must\r\nimpress any one, and I was showing, I do believe, to my best advantage.\r\nWhen I smiled at him and said I left my boy in his hands with the most\r\nentire confidence that he would be as well cared for as if he were at\r\nmy own house, I am sure he was greatly pleased. I should not think many\r\nof the mothers who bring him boys can impress him so favourably, or say\r\nsuch nice things to him as I did. My smile is sweet when I desire to\r\nmake it so. I never was perhaps exactly pretty, but I was always\r\nadmitted to be fascinating. Dr Skinner is a very handsome man\xe2\x80\x94too good\r\non the whole I should say for Mrs Skinner. Theobald says he is not\r\nhandsome, but men are no judges, and he has such a pleasant bright\r\nface. I think my bonnet became me. As soon as I get home I will tell\r\nChambers to trim my blue and yellow merino with\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d etc., etc.\r\n\r\nAll this time the letter which has been given above was lying in\r\nChristina\xe2\x80\x99s private little Japanese cabinet, read and re-read and\r\napproved of many times over, not to say, if the truth were known,\r\nrewritten more than once, though dated as in the first instance\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthis, too, though Christina was fond enough of a joke in a small way.\r\n\r\nErnest, still in Mrs Jay\xe2\x80\x99s room mused onward. \xe2\x80\x9cGrown-up people,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen they were ladies and gentlemen, never did\r\nnaughty things, but he was always doing them. He had heard that some\r\ngrown-up people were worldly, which of course was wrong, still this was\r\nquite distinct from being naughty, and did not get them punished or\r\nscolded. His own Papa and Mamma were not even worldly; they had often\r\nexplained to him that they were exceptionally unworldly; he well knew\r\nthat they had never done anything naughty since they had been children,\r\nand that even as children they had been nearly faultless. Oh! how\r\ndifferent from himself! When should he learn to love his Papa and Mamma\r\nas they had loved theirs? How could he hope ever to grow up to be as\r\ngood and wise as they, or even tolerably good and wise? Alas! never. It\r\ncould not be. He did not love his Papa and Mamma, in spite of all their\r\ngoodness both in themselves and to him. He hated Papa, and did not like\r\nMamma, and this was what none but a bad and ungrateful boy would do\r\nafter all that had been done for him. Besides he did not like Sunday;\r\nhe did not like anything that was really good; his tastes were low and\r\nsuch as he was ashamed of. He liked people best if they sometimes swore\r\na little, so long as it was not at him. As for his Catechism and Bible\r\nreadings he had no heart in them. He had never attended to a sermon in\r\nhis life. Even when he had been taken to hear Mr Vaughan at Brighton,\r\nwho, as everyone knew, preached such beautiful sermons for children, he\r\nhad been very glad when it was all over, nor did he believe he could\r\nget through church at all if it was not for the voluntary upon the\r\norgan and the hymns and chanting. The Catechism was awful. He had never\r\nbeen able to understand what it was that he desired of his Lord God and\r\nHeavenly Father, nor had he yet got hold of a single idea in connection\r\nwith the word Sacrament. His duty towards his neighbour was another\r\nbugbear. It seemed to him that he had duties towards everybody, lying\r\nin wait for him upon every side, but that nobody had any duties towards\r\nhim. Then there was that awful and mysterious word \xe2\x80\x98business.\xe2\x80\x99 What did\r\nit all mean? What was \xe2\x80\x98business\xe2\x80\x99? His Papa was a wonderfully good man\r\nof business, his Mamma had often told him so\xe2\x80\x94but he should never be\r\none. It was hopeless, and very awful, for people were continually\r\ntelling him that he would have to earn his own living. No doubt, but\r\nhow\xe2\x80\x94considering how stupid, idle, ignorant, self-indulgent, and\r\nphysically puny he was? All grown-up people were clever, except\r\nservants\xe2\x80\x94and even these were cleverer than ever he should be. Oh, why,\r\nwhy, why, could not people be born into the world as grown-up persons?\r\nThen he thought of Casabianca. He had been examined in that poem by his\r\nfather not long before. \xe2\x80\x98When only would he leave his position? To whom\r\ndid he call? Did he get an answer? Why? How many times did he call upon\r\nhis father? What happened to him? What was the noblest life that\r\nperished there? Do you think so? Why do you think so?\xe2\x80\x99 And all the rest\r\nof it. Of course he thought Casabianca\xe2\x80\x99s was the noblest life that\r\nperished there; there could be no two opinions about that; it never\r\noccurred to him that the moral of the poem was that young people cannot\r\nbegin too soon to exercise discretion in the obedience they pay to\r\ntheir Papa and Mamma. Oh, no! the only thought in his mind was that he\r\nshould never, never have been like Casabianca, and that Casabianca\r\nwould have despised him so much, if he could have known him, that he\r\nwould not have condescended to speak to him. There was nobody else in\r\nthe ship worth reckoning at all: it did not matter how much they were\r\nblown up. Mrs Hemans knew them all and they were a very indifferent\r\nlot. Besides Casabianca was so good-looking and came of such a good\r\nfamily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd thus his small mind kept wandering on till he could follow it no\r\nlonger, and again went off into a doze.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning Theobald and Christina arose feeling a little tired from\r\ntheir journey, but happy in that best of all happiness, the approbation\r\nof their consciences. It would be their boy\xe2\x80\x99s fault henceforth if he\r\nwere not good, and as prosperous as it was at all desirable that he\r\nshould be. What more could parents do than they had done? The answer\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing\xe2\x80\x9d will rise as readily to the lips of the reader as to those of\r\nTheobald and Christina themselves.\r\n\r\nA few days later the parents were gratified at receiving the following\r\nletter from their son\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Dear Mamma,\xe2\x80\x94I am very well. Dr Skinner made me do about the horse\r\nfree and exulting roaming in the wide fields in Latin verse, but as I\r\nhad done it with Papa I knew how to do it, and it was nearly all right,\r\nand he put me in the fourth form under Mr Templer, and I have to begin\r\na new Latin grammar not like the old, but much harder. I know you wish\r\nme to work, and I will try very hard. With best love to Joey and\r\nCharlotte, and to Papa, I remain, your affectionate son,\r\n\r\n\r\nERNEST.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing could be nicer or more proper. It really did seem as though he\r\nwere inclined to turn over a new leaf. The boys had all come back, the\r\nexaminations were over, and the routine of the half year began; Ernest\r\nfound that his fears about being kicked about and bullied were\r\nexaggerated. Nobody did anything very dreadful to him. He had to run\r\nerrands between certain hours for the elder boys, and to take his turn\r\nat greasing the footballs, and so forth, but there was an excellent\r\nspirit in the school as regards bullying.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he was far from happy. Dr Skinner was much too like his\r\nfather. True, Ernest was not thrown in with him much yet, but he was\r\nalways there; there was no knowing at what moment he might not put in\r\nan appearance, and whenever he did show, it was to storm about\r\nsomething. He was like the lion in the Bishop of Oxford\xe2\x80\x99s Sunday\r\nstory\xe2\x80\x94always liable to rush out from behind some bush and devour some\r\none when he was least expected. He called Ernest \xe2\x80\x9can audacious reptile\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand said he wondered the earth did not open and swallow him up because\r\nhe pronounced Thalia with a short i. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd this to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he thundered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwho never made a false quantity in my life.\xe2\x80\x9d Surely he would have been\r\na much nicer person if he had made false quantities in his youth like\r\nother people. Ernest could not imagine how the boys in Dr Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nform continued to live; but yet they did, and even throve, and, strange\r\nas it may seem, idolised him, or professed to do so in after life. To\r\nErnest it seemed like living on the crater of Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nHe was himself, as has been said, in Mr Templer\xe2\x80\x99s form, who was\r\nsnappish, but not downright wicked, and was very easy to crib under.\r\nErnest used to wonder how Mr Templer could be so blind, for he supposed\r\nMr Templer must have cribbed when he was at school, and would ask\r\nhimself whether he should forget his youth when he got old, as Mr\r\nTempler had forgotten his. He used to think he never could possibly\r\nforget any part of it.\r\n\r\nThen there was Mrs Jay, who was sometimes very alarming. A few days\r\nafter the half year had commenced, there being some little extra noise\r\nin the hall, she rushed in with her spectacles on her forehead and her\r\ncap strings flying, and called the boy whom Ernest had selected as his\r\nhero the \xe2\x80\x9crampingest-scampingest-rackety-tackety-tow-row-roaringest boy\r\nin the whole school.\xe2\x80\x9d But she used to say things that Ernest liked. If\r\nthe Doctor went out to dinner, and there were no prayers, she would\r\ncome in and say, \xe2\x80\x9cYoung gentlemen, prayers are excused this evening\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\nand, take her for all in all, she was a kindly old soul enough.\r\n\r\nMost boys soon discover the difference between noise and actual danger,\r\nbut to others it is so unnatural to menace, unless they mean mischief,\r\nthat they are long before they leave off taking turkey-cocks and\r\nganders _au s\xc3\xa9rieux_. Ernest was one of the latter sort, and found the\r\natmosphere of Roughborough so gusty that he was glad to shrink out of\r\nsight and out of mind whenever he could. He disliked the games worse\r\neven than the squalls of the class-room and hall, for he was still\r\nfeeble, not filling out and attaining his full strength till a much\r\nlater age than most boys. This was perhaps due to the closeness with\r\nwhich his father had kept him to his books in childhood, but I think in\r\npart also to a tendency towards lateness in attaining maturity,\r\nhereditary in the Pontifex family, which was one also of unusual\r\nlongevity. At thirteen or fourteen he was a mere bag of bones, with\r\nupper arms about as thick as the wrists of other boys of his age; his\r\nlittle chest was pigeon-breasted; he appeared to have no strength or\r\nstamina whatever, and finding he always went to the wall in physical\r\nencounters, whether undertaken in jest or earnest, even with boys\r\nshorter than himself, the timidity natural to childhood increased upon\r\nhim to an extent that I am afraid amounted to cowardice. This rendered\r\nhim even less capable than he might otherwise have been, for as\r\nconfidence increases power, so want of confidence increases impotence.\r\nAfter he had had the breath knocked out of him and been well shinned\r\nhalf a dozen times in scrimmages at football\xe2\x80\x94scrimmages in which he had\r\nbecome involved sorely against his will\xe2\x80\x94he ceased to see any further\r\nfun in football, and shirked that noble game in a way that got him into\r\ntrouble with the elder boys, who would stand no shirking on the part of\r\nthe younger ones.\r\n\r\nHe was as useless and ill at ease with cricket as with football, nor in\r\nspite of all his efforts could he ever throw a ball or a stone. It soon\r\nbecame plain, therefore, to everyone that Pontifex was a young muff, a\r\nmollycoddle, not to be tortured, but still not to be rated highly. He\r\nwas not however, actively unpopular, for it was seen that he was quite\r\nsquare _inter pares_, not at all vindictive, easily pleased, perfectly\r\nfree with whatever little money he had, no greater lover of his school\r\nwork than of the games, and generally more inclinable to moderate vice\r\nthan to immoderate virtue.\r\n\r\nThese qualities will prevent any boy from sinking very low in the\r\nopinion of his schoolfellows; but Ernest thought he had fallen lower\r\nthan he probably had, and hated and despised himself for what he, as\r\nmuch as anyone else, believed to be his cowardice. He did not like the\r\nboys whom he thought like himself. His heroes were strong and vigorous,\r\nand the less they inclined towards him the more he worshipped them. All\r\nthis made him very unhappy, for it never occurred to him that the\r\ninstinct which made him keep out of games for which he was ill adapted,\r\nwas more reasonable than the reason which would have driven him into\r\nthem. Nevertheless he followed his instinct for the most part, rather\r\nthan his reason. _Sapiens suam si sapientiam n\xc3\xb4rit_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the masters Ernest was ere long in absolute disgrace. He had more\r\nliberty now than he had known heretofore. The heavy hand and watchful\r\neye of Theobald were no longer about his path and about his bed and\r\nspying out all his ways; and punishment by way of copying out lines of\r\nVirgil was a very different thing from the savage beatings of his\r\nfather. The copying out in fact was often less trouble than the lesson.\r\nLatin and Greek had nothing in them which commended them to his\r\ninstinct as likely to bring him peace even at the last; still less did\r\nthey hold out any hope of doing so within some more reasonable time.\r\nThe deadness inherent in these defunct languages themselves had never\r\nbeen artificially counteracted by a system of _bona fide_ rewards for\r\napplication. There had been any amount of punishments for want of\r\napplication, but no good comfortable bribes had baited the hook which\r\nwas to allure him to his good.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the more pleasant side of learning to do this or that had\r\nalways been treated as something with which Ernest had no concern. We\r\nhad no business with pleasant things at all, at any rate very little\r\nbusiness, at any rate not he, Ernest. We were put into this world not\r\nfor pleasure but duty, and pleasure had in it something more or less\r\nsinful in its very essence. If we were doing anything we liked, we, or\r\nat any rate he, Ernest, should apologise and think he was being very\r\nmercifully dealt with, if not at once told to go and do something else.\r\nWith what he did not like, however, it was different; the more he\r\ndisliked a thing the greater the presumption that it was right. It\r\nnever occurred to him that the presumption was in favour of the\r\nrightness of what was most pleasant, and that the onus of proving that\r\nit was not right lay with those who disputed its being so. I have said\r\nmore than once that he believed in his own depravity; never was there a\r\nlittle mortal more ready to accept without cavil whatever he was told\r\nby those who were in authority over him: he thought, at least, that he\r\nbelieved it, for as yet he knew nothing of that other Ernest that dwelt\r\nwithin him, and was so much stronger and more real than the Ernest of\r\nwhich he was conscious. The dumb Ernest persuaded with inarticulate\r\nfeelings too swift and sure to be translated into such debateable\r\nthings as words, but practically insisted as follows\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrowing is not the easy plain sailing business that it is commonly\r\nsupposed to be: it is hard work\xe2\x80\x94harder than any but a growing boy can\r\nunderstand; it requires attention, and you are not strong enough to\r\nattend to your bodily growth, and to your lessons too. Besides, Latin\r\nand Greek are great humbug; the more people know of them the more\r\nodious they generally are; the nice people whom you delight in either\r\nnever knew any at all or forgot what they had learned as soon as they\r\ncould; they never turned to the classics after they were no longer\r\nforced to read them; therefore they are nonsense, all very well in\r\ntheir own time and country, but out of place here. Never learn anything\r\nuntil you find you have been made uncomfortable for a good long while\r\nby not knowing it; when you find that you have occasion for this or\r\nthat knowledge, or foresee that you will have occasion for it shortly,\r\nthe sooner you learn it the better, but till then spend your time in\r\ngrowing bone and muscle; these will be much more useful to you than\r\nLatin and Greek, nor will you ever be able to make them if you do not\r\ndo so now, whereas Latin and Greek can be acquired at any time by those\r\nwho want them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are surrounded on every side by lies which would deceive even the\r\nelect, if the elect were not generally so uncommonly wide awake; the\r\nself of which you are conscious, your reasoning and reflecting self,\r\nwill believe these lies and bid you act in accordance with them. This\r\nconscious self of yours, Ernest, is a prig begotten of prigs and\r\ntrained in priggishness; I will not allow it to shape your actions,\r\nthough it will doubtless shape your words for many a year to come. Your\r\npapa is not here to beat you now; this is a change in the conditions of\r\nyour existence, and should be followed by changed actions. Obey me,\r\nyour true self, and things will go tolerably well with you, but only\r\nlisten to that outward and visible old husk of yours which is called\r\nyour father, and I will rend you in pieces even unto the third and\r\nfourth generation as one who has hated God; for I, Ernest, am the God\r\nwho made you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow shocked Ernest would have been if he could have heard the advice he\r\nwas receiving; what consternation too there would have been at\r\nBattersby; but the matter did not end here, for this same wicked inner\r\nself gave him bad advice about his pocket money, the choice of his\r\ncompanions and on the whole Ernest was attentive and obedient to its\r\nbehests, more so than Theobald had been. The consequence was that he\r\nlearned little, his mind growing more slowly and his body rather faster\r\nthan heretofore: and when by and by his inner self urged him in\r\ndirections where he met obstacles beyond his strength to combat, he\r\ntook\xe2\x80\x94though with passionate compunctions of conscience\xe2\x80\x94the nearest\r\ncourse to the one from which he was debarred which circumstances would\r\nallow.\r\n\r\nIt may be guessed that Ernest was not the chosen friend of the more\r\nsedate and well-conducted youths then studying at Roughborough. Some of\r\nthe less desirable boys used to go to public-houses and drink more beer\r\nthan was good for them; Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s inner self can hardly have told him to\r\nally himself to these young gentlemen, but he did so at an early age,\r\nand was sometimes made pitiably sick by an amount of beer which would\r\nhave produced no effect upon a stronger boy. Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s inner self must\r\nhave interposed at this point and told him that there was not much fun\r\nin this, for he dropped the habit ere it had taken firm hold of him,\r\nand never resumed it; but he contracted another at the disgracefully\r\nearly age of between thirteen and fourteen which he did not relinquish,\r\nthough to the present day his conscious self keeps dinging it into him\r\nthat the less he smokes the better.\r\n\r\nAnd so matters went on till my hero was nearly fourteen years old. If\r\nby that time he was not actually a young blackguard, he belonged to a\r\ndebateable class between the sub-reputable and the upper disreputable,\r\nwith perhaps rather more leaning to the latter except so far as vices\r\nof meanness were concerned, from which he was fairly free. I gather\r\nthis partly from what Ernest has told me, and partly from his school\r\nbills which I remember Theobald showed me with much complaining. There\r\nwas an institution at Roughborough called the monthly merit money; the\r\nmaximum sum which a boy of Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s age could get was four shillings\r\nand sixpence; several boys got four shillings and few less than\r\nsixpence, but Ernest never got more than half-a-crown and seldom more\r\nthan eighteen pence; his average would, I should think, be about one\r\nand nine pence, which was just too much for him to rank among the\r\ndownright bad boys, but too little to put him among the good ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nI must now return to Miss Alethea Pontifex, of whom I have said perhaps\r\ntoo little hitherto, considering how great her influence upon my hero\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndestiny proved to be.\r\n\r\nOn the death of her father, which happened when she was about\r\nthirty-two years old, she parted company with her sisters, between whom\r\nand herself there had been little sympathy, and came up to London. She\r\nwas determined, so she said, to make the rest of her life as happy as\r\nshe could, and she had clearer ideas about the best way of setting to\r\nwork to do this than women, or indeed men, generally have.\r\n\r\nHer fortune consisted, as I have said, of \xc2\xa35000, which had come to her\r\nby her mother\xe2\x80\x99s marriage settlements, and \xc2\xa315,000 left her by her\r\nfather, over both which sums she had now absolute control. These\r\nbrought her in about \xc2\xa3900 a year, and the money being invested in none\r\nbut the soundest securities, she had no anxiety about her income. She\r\nmeant to be rich, so she formed a scheme of expenditure which involved\r\nan annual outlay of about \xc2\xa3500, and determined to put the rest by. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nI do this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said laughingly, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall probably just succeed in\r\nliving comfortably within my income.\xe2\x80\x9d In accordance with this scheme\r\nshe took unfurnished apartments in a house in Gower Street, of which\r\nthe lower floors were let out as offices. John Pontifex tried to get\r\nher to take a house to herself, but Alethea told him to mind his own\r\nbusiness so plainly that he had to beat a retreat. She had never liked\r\nhim, and from that time dropped him almost entirely.\r\n\r\nWithout going much into society she yet became acquainted with most of\r\nthe men and women who had attained a position in the literary, artistic\r\nand scientific worlds, and it was singular how highly her opinion was\r\nvalued in spite of her never having attempted in any way to distinguish\r\nherself. She could have written if she had chosen, but she enjoyed\r\nseeing others write and encouraging them better than taking a more\r\nactive part herself. Perhaps literary people liked her all the better\r\nbecause she did not write.\r\n\r\nI, as she very well knew, had always been devoted to her, and she might\r\nhave had a score of other admirers if she had liked, but she had\r\ndiscouraged them all, and railed at matrimony as women seldom do unless\r\nthey have a comfortable income of their own. She by no means, however,\r\nrailed at man as she railed at matrimony, and though living after a\r\nfashion in which even the most censorious could find nothing to\r\ncomplain of, as far as she properly could she defended those of her own\r\nsex whom the world condemned most severely.\r\n\r\nIn religion she was, I should think, as nearly a freethinker as anyone\r\ncould be whose mind seldom turned upon the subject. She went to church,\r\nbut disliked equally those who aired either religion or irreligion. I\r\nremember once hearing her press a late well-known philosopher to write\r\na novel instead of pursuing his attacks upon religion. The philosopher\r\ndid not much like this, and dilated upon the importance of showing\r\npeople the folly of much that they pretended to believe. She smiled and\r\nsaid demurely, \xe2\x80\x9cHave they not Moses and the prophets? Let them hear\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d But she would say a wicked thing quietly on her own account\r\nsometimes, and called my attention once to a note in her prayer-book\r\nwhich gave account of the walk to Emmaus with the two disciples, and\r\nhow Christ had said to them \xe2\x80\x9cO fools and slow of heart to believe ALL\r\nthat the prophets have spoken\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9call\xe2\x80\x9d being printed in small\r\ncapitals.\r\n\r\nThough scarcely on terms with her brother John, she had kept up closer\r\nrelations with Theobald and his family, and had paid a few days\xe2\x80\x99 visit\r\nto Battersby once in every two years or so. Alethea had always tried to\r\nlike Theobald and join forces with him as much as she could (for they\r\ntwo were the hares of the family, the rest being all hounds), but it\r\nwas no use. I believe her chief reason for maintaining relations with\r\nher brother was that she might keep an eye on his children and give\r\nthem a lift if they proved nice.\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Pontifex had come down to Battersby in old times the children\r\nhad not been beaten, and their lessons had been made lighter. She\r\neasily saw that they were overworked and unhappy, but she could hardly\r\nguess how all-reaching was the r\xc3\xa9gime under which they lived. She knew\r\nshe could not interfere effectually then, and wisely forbore to make\r\ntoo many enquiries. Her time, if ever it was to come, would be when the\r\nchildren were no longer living under the same roof as their parents. It\r\nended in her making up her mind to have nothing to do with either Joey\r\nor Charlotte, but to see so much of Ernest as should enable her to form\r\nan opinion about his disposition and abilities.\r\n\r\nHe had now been a year and a half at Roughborough and was nearly\r\nfourteen years old, so that his character had begun to shape. His aunt\r\nhad not seen him for some little time and, thinking that if she was to\r\nexploit him she could do so now perhaps better than at any other time,\r\nshe resolved to go down to Roughborough on some pretext which should be\r\ngood enough for Theobald, and to take stock of her nephew under\r\ncircumstances in which she could get him for some few hours to herself.\r\nAccordingly in August 1849, when Ernest was just entering on his fourth\r\nhalf year a cab drove up to Dr Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s door with Miss Pontifex, who\r\nasked and obtained leave for Ernest to come and dine with her at the\r\nSwan Hotel. She had written to Ernest to say she was coming and he was\r\nof course on the look-out for her. He had not seen her for so long that\r\nhe was rather shy at first, but her good nature soon set him at his\r\nease. She was so strongly biassed in favour of anything young that her\r\nheart warmed towards him at once, though his appearance was less\r\nprepossessing than she had hoped. She took him to a cake shop and gave\r\nhim whatever he liked as soon as she had got him off the school\r\npremises; and Ernest felt at once that she contrasted favourably even\r\nwith his aunts the Misses Allaby, who were so very sweet and good. The\r\nMisses Allaby were very poor; sixpence was to them what five shillings\r\nwas to Alethea. What chance had they against one who, if she had a\r\nmind, could put by out of her income twice as much as they, poor women,\r\ncould spend?\r\n\r\nThe boy had plenty of prattle in him when he was not snubbed, and\r\nAlethea encouraged him to chatter about whatever came uppermost. He was\r\nalways ready to trust anyone who was kind to him; it took many years to\r\nmake him reasonably wary in this respect\xe2\x80\x94if indeed, as I sometimes\r\ndoubt, he ever will be as wary as he ought to be\xe2\x80\x94and in a short time he\r\nhad quite dissociated his aunt from his papa and mamma and the rest,\r\nwith whom his instinct told him he should be on his guard. Little did\r\nhe know how great, as far as he was concerned, were the issues that\r\ndepended upon his behaviour. If he had known, he would perhaps have\r\nplayed his part less successfully.\r\n\r\nHis aunt drew from him more details of his home and school life than\r\nhis papa and mamma would have approved of, but he had no idea that he\r\nwas being pumped. She got out of him all about the happy Sunday\r\nevenings, and how he and Joey and Charlotte quarrelled sometimes, but\r\nshe took no side and treated everything as though it were a matter of\r\ncourse. Like all the boys, he could mimic Dr Skinner, and when warmed\r\nwith dinner, and two glasses of sherry which made him nearly tipsy, he\r\nfavoured his aunt with samples of the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s manner and spoke of him\r\nfamiliarly as \xe2\x80\x9cSam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSam,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis an awful old humbug.\xe2\x80\x9d It was the sherry that\r\nbrought out this piece of swagger, for whatever else he was Dr Skinner\r\nwas a reality to Master Ernest, before which, indeed, he sank into his\r\nboots in no time. Alethea smiled and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI must not say anything to\r\nthat, must I?\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest said, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose not,\xe2\x80\x9d and was checked. By-and-by\r\nhe vented a number of small second-hand priggishnesses which he had\r\ncaught up believing them to be the correct thing, and made it plain\r\nthat even at that early age Ernest believed in Ernest with a belief\r\nwhich was amusing from its absurdity. His aunt judged him charitably as\r\nshe was sure to do; she knew very well where the priggishness came\r\nfrom, and seeing that the string of his tongue had been loosened\r\nsufficiently gave him no more sherry.\r\n\r\nIt was after dinner, however, that he completed the conquest of his\r\naunt. She then discovered that, like herself, he was passionately fond\r\nof music, and that, too, of the highest class. He knew, and hummed or\r\nwhistled to her all sorts of pieces out of the works of the great\r\nmasters, which a boy of his age could hardly be expected to know, and\r\nit was evident that this was purely instinctive, inasmuch as music\r\nreceived no kind of encouragement at Roughborough. There was no boy in\r\nthe school as fond of music as he was. He picked up his knowledge, he\r\nsaid, from the organist of St Michael\xe2\x80\x99s Church who used to practise\r\nsometimes on a week-day afternoon. Ernest had heard the organ booming\r\naway as he was passing outside the church and had sneaked inside and up\r\ninto the organ loft. In the course of time the organist became\r\naccustomed to him as a familiar visitant, and the pair became friends.\r\n\r\nIt was this which decided Alethea that the boy was worth taking pains\r\nwith. \xe2\x80\x9cHe likes the best music,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, \xe2\x80\x9cand he hates Dr Skinner.\r\nThis is a very fair beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d When she sent him away at night with a\r\nsovereign in his pocket (and he had only hoped to get five shillings)\r\nshe felt as though she had had a good deal more than her money\xe2\x80\x99s worth\r\nfor her money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day Miss Pontifex returned to town, with her thoughts full of her\r\nnephew and how she could best be of use to him.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to her that to do him any real service she must devote\r\nherself almost entirely to him; she must in fact give up living in\r\nLondon, at any rate for a long time, and live at Roughborough where she\r\ncould see him continually. This was a serious undertaking; she had\r\nlived in London for the last twelve years, and naturally disliked the\r\nprospect of a small country town such as Roughborough. Was it a prudent\r\nthing to attempt so much? Must not people take their chances in this\r\nworld? Can anyone do much for anyone else unless by making a will in\r\nhis favour and dying then and there? Should not each look after his own\r\nhappiness, and will not the world be best carried on if everyone minds\r\nhis own business and leaves other people to mind theirs? Life is not a\r\ndonkey race in which everyone is to ride his neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s donkey and the\r\nlast is to win, and the psalmist long since formulated a common\r\nexperience when he declared that no man may deliver his brother nor\r\nmake agreement unto God for him, for it cost more to redeem their\r\nsouls, so that he must let that alone for ever.\r\n\r\nAll these excellent reasons for letting her nephew alone occurred to\r\nher, and many more, but against them there pleaded a woman\xe2\x80\x99s love for\r\nchildren, and her desire to find someone among the younger branches of\r\nher own family to whom she could become warmly attached, and whom she\r\ncould attach warmly to herself.\r\n\r\nOver and above this she wanted someone to leave her money to; she was\r\nnot going to leave it to people about whom she knew very little, merely\r\nbecause they happened to be sons and daughters of brothers and sisters\r\nwhom she had never liked. She knew the power and value of money\r\nexceedingly well, and how many lovable people suffer and die yearly for\r\nthe want of it; she was little likely to leave it without being\r\nsatisfied that her legatees were square, lovable, and more or less hard\r\nup. She wanted those to have it who would be most likely to use it\r\ngenially and sensibly, and whom it would thus be likely to make most\r\nhappy; if she could find one such among her nephews and nieces, so much\r\nthe better; it was worth taking a great deal of pains to see whether\r\nshe could or could not; but if she failed, she must find an heir who\r\nwas not related to her by blood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d she had said to me, more than once, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall make a mess\r\nof it. I shall choose some nice-looking, well-dressed screw, with\r\ngentlemanly manners which will take me in, and he will go and paint\r\nAcademy pictures, or write for the _Times_, or do something just as\r\nhorrid the moment the breath is out of my body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs yet, however, she had made no will at all, and this was one of the\r\nfew things that troubled her. I believe she would have left most of her\r\nmoney to me if I had not stopped her. My father left me abundantly well\r\noff, and my mode of life has been always simple, so that I have never\r\nknown uneasiness about money; moreover I was especially anxious that\r\nthere should be no occasion given for ill-natured talk; she knew well,\r\ntherefore, that her leaving her money to me would be of all things the\r\nmost likely to weaken the ties that existed between us, provided that I\r\nwas aware of it, but I did not mind her talking about whom she should\r\nmake her heir, so long as it was well understood that I was not to be\r\nthe person.\r\n\r\nErnest had satisfied her as having enough in him to tempt her strongly\r\nto take him up, but it was not till after many days\xe2\x80\x99 reflection that\r\nshe gravitated towards actually doing so, with all the break in her\r\ndaily ways that this would entail. At least, she said it took her some\r\ndays, and certainly it appeared to do so, but from the moment she had\r\nbegun to broach the subject, I had guessed how things were going to\r\nend.\r\n\r\nIt was now arranged she should take a house at Roughborough, and go and\r\nlive there for a couple of years. As a compromise, however, to meet\r\nsome of my objections, it was also arranged that she should keep her\r\nrooms in Gower Street, and come to town for a week once in each month;\r\nof course, also, she would leave Roughborough for the greater part of\r\nthe holidays. After two years, the thing was to come to an end, unless\r\nit proved a great success. She should by that time, at any rate, have\r\nmade up her mind what the boy\xe2\x80\x99s character was, and would then act as\r\ncircumstances might determine.\r\n\r\nThe pretext she put forward ostensibly was that her doctor said she\r\nought to be a year or two in the country after so many years of London\r\nlife, and had recommended Roughborough on account of the purity of its\r\nair, and its easy access to and from London\xe2\x80\x94for by this time the\r\nrailway had reached it. She was anxious not to give her brother and\r\nsister any right to complain, if on seeing more of her nephew she found\r\nshe could not get on with him, and she was also anxious not to raise\r\nfalse hopes of any kind in the boy\xe2\x80\x99s own mind.\r\n\r\nHaving settled how everything was to be, she wrote to Theobald and said\r\nshe meant to take a house in Roughborough from the Michaelmas then\r\napproaching, and mentioned, as though casually, that one of the\r\nattractions of the place would be that her nephew was at school there\r\nand she should hope to see more of him than she had done hitherto.\r\n\r\nTheobald and Christina knew how dearly Alethea loved London, and\r\nthought it very odd that she should want to go and live at\r\nRoughborough, but they did not suspect that she was going there solely\r\non her nephew\xe2\x80\x99s account, much less that she had thought of making\r\nErnest her heir. If they had guessed this, they would have been so\r\njealous that I half believe they would have asked her to go and live\r\nsomewhere else. Alethea however, was two or three years younger than\r\nTheobald; she was still some years short of fifty, and might very well\r\nlive to eighty-five or ninety; her money, therefore, was not worth\r\ntaking much trouble about, and her brother and sister-in-law had\r\ndismissed it, so to speak, from their minds with costs, assuming,\r\nhowever, that if anything did happen to her while they were still\r\nalive, the money would, as a matter of course, come to them.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of Alethea seeing much of Ernest was a serious matter.\r\nChristina smelt mischief from afar, as indeed she often did. Alethea\r\nwas worldly\xe2\x80\x94as worldly, that is to say, as a sister of Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s could\r\nbe. In her letter to Theobald she had said she knew how much of his and\r\nChristina\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts were taken up with anxiety for the boy\xe2\x80\x99s welfare.\r\nAlethea had thought this handsome enough, but Christina had wanted\r\nsomething better and stronger. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can she know how much we think of\r\nour darling?\xe2\x80\x9d she had exclaimed, when Theobald showed her his sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter. \xe2\x80\x9cI think, my dear, Alethea would understand these things better\r\nif she had children of her own.\xe2\x80\x9d The least that would have satisfied\r\nChristina was to have been told that there never yet had been any\r\nparents comparable to Theobald and herself. She did not feel easy that\r\nan alliance of some kind would not grow up between aunt and nephew, and\r\nneither she nor Theobald wanted Ernest to have any allies. Joey and\r\nCharlotte were quite as many allies as were good for him. After all,\r\nhowever, if Alethea chose to go and live at Roughborough, they could\r\nnot well stop her, and must make the best of it.\r\n\r\nIn a few weeks\xe2\x80\x99 time Alethea did choose to go and live at Roughborough.\r\nA house was found with a field and a nice little garden which suited\r\nher very well. \xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cI will have fresh\r\neggs and flowers.\xe2\x80\x9d She even considered the question of keeping a cow,\r\nbut in the end decided not to do so. She furnished her house throughout\r\nanew, taking nothing whatever from her establishment in Gower Street,\r\nand by Michaelmas\xe2\x80\x94for the house was empty when she took it\xe2\x80\x94she was\r\nsettled comfortably, and had begun to make herself at home.\r\n\r\nOne of Miss Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s first moves was to ask a dozen of the smartest\r\nand most gentlemanly boys to breakfast with her. From her seat in\r\nchurch she could see the faces of the upper-form boys, and soon made up\r\nher mind which of them it would be best to cultivate. Miss Pontifex,\r\nsitting opposite the boys in church, and reckoning them up with her\r\nkeen eyes from under her veil by all a woman\xe2\x80\x99s criteria, came to a\r\ntruer conclusion about the greater number of those she scrutinized than\r\neven Dr Skinner had done. She fell in love with one boy from seeing him\r\nput on his gloves.\r\n\r\nMiss Pontifex, as I have said, got hold of some of these youngsters\r\nthrough Ernest, and fed them well. No boy can resist being fed well by\r\na good-natured and still handsome woman. Boys are very like nice dogs\r\nin this respect\xe2\x80\x94give them a bone and they will like you at once.\r\nAlethea employed every other little artifice which she thought likely\r\nto win their allegiance to herself, and through this their countenance\r\nfor her nephew. She found the football club in a slight money\r\ndifficulty and at once gave half a sovereign towards its removal. The\r\nboys had no chance against her, she shot them down one after another as\r\neasily as though they had been roosting pheasants. Nor did she escape\r\nscathless herself, for, as she wrote to me, she quite lost her heart to\r\nhalf a dozen of them. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much nicer they are,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand how\r\nmuch more they know than those who profess to teach them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI believe it has been lately maintained that it is the young and fair\r\nwho are the truly old and truly experienced, inasmuch as it is they who\r\nalone have a living memory to guide them; \xe2\x80\x9cthe whole charm,\xe2\x80\x9d it has\r\nbeen said, \xe2\x80\x9cof youth lies in its advantage over age in respect of\r\nexperience, and when this has for some reason failed or been\r\nmisapplied, the charm is broken. When we say that we are getting old,\r\nwe should say rather that we are getting new or young, and are\r\nsuffering from inexperience; trying to do things which we have never\r\ndone before, and failing worse and worse, till in the end we are landed\r\nin the utter impotence of death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Pontifex died many a long year before the above passage was\r\nwritten, but she had arrived independently at much the same conclusion.\r\n\r\nShe first, therefore, squared the boys. Dr Skinner was even more easily\r\ndealt with. He and Mrs Skinner called, as a matter of course, as soon\r\nas Miss Pontifex was settled. She fooled him to the top of his bent,\r\nand obtained the promise of a MS. copy of one of his minor poems (for\r\nDr Skinner had the reputation of being quite one of our most facile and\r\nelegant minor poets) on the occasion of his first visit. The other\r\nmasters and masters\xe2\x80\x99 wives were not forgotten. Alethea laid herself out\r\nto please, as indeed she did wherever she went, and if any woman lays\r\nherself out to do this, she generally succeeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Pontifex soon found out that Ernest did not like games, but she\r\nsaw also that he could hardly be expected to like them. He was\r\nperfectly well shaped but unusually devoid of physical strength. He got\r\na fair share of this in after life, but it came much later with him\r\nthan with other boys, and at the time of which I am writing he was a\r\nmere little skeleton. He wanted something to develop his arms and chest\r\nwithout knocking him about as much as the school games did. To supply\r\nthis want by some means which should add also to his pleasure was\r\nAlethea\xe2\x80\x99s first anxiety. Rowing would have answered every purpose, but\r\nunfortunately there was no river at Roughborough.\r\n\r\nWhatever it was to be, it must be something which he should like as\r\nmuch as other boys liked cricket or football, and he must think the\r\nwish for it to have come originally from himself; it was not very easy\r\nto find anything that would do, but ere long it occurred to her that\r\nshe might enlist his love of music on her side, and asked him one day\r\nwhen he was spending a half-holiday at her house whether he would like\r\nher to buy an organ for him to play on. Of course, the boy said yes;\r\nthen she told him about her grandfather and the organs he had built. It\r\nhad never entered into his head that he could make one, but when he\r\ngathered from what his aunt had said that this was not out of the\r\nquestion, he rose as eagerly to the bait as she could have desired, and\r\nwanted to begin learning to saw and plane so that he might make the\r\nwooden pipes at once.\r\n\r\nMiss Pontifex did not see how she could have hit upon anything more\r\nsuitable, and she liked the idea that he would incidentally get a\r\nknowledge of carpentering, for she was impressed, perhaps foolishly,\r\nwith the wisdom of the German custom which gives every boy a handicraft\r\nof some sort.\r\n\r\nWriting to me on this matter, she said \xe2\x80\x9cProfessions are all very well\r\nfor those who have connection and interest as well as capital, but\r\notherwise they are white elephants. How many men do not you and I know\r\nwho have talent, assiduity, excellent good sense, straightforwardness,\r\nevery quality in fact which should command success, and who yet go on\r\nfrom year to year waiting and hoping against hope for the work which\r\nnever comes? How, indeed, is it likely to come unless to those who\r\neither are born with interest, or who marry in order to get it?\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x99s father and mother have no interest, and if they had they would\r\nnot use it. I suppose they will make him a clergyman, or try to do\r\nso\xe2\x80\x94perhaps it is the best thing to do with him, for he could buy a\r\nliving with the money his grandfather left him, but there is no knowing\r\nwhat the boy will think of it when the time comes, and for aught we\r\nknow he may insist on going to the backwoods of America, as so many\r\nother young men are doing now.\xe2\x80\x9d . . . But, anyway, he would like making\r\nan organ, and this could do him no harm, so the sooner he began the\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nAlethea thought it would save trouble in the end if she told her\r\nbrother and sister-in-law of this scheme. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwrote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Dr Skinner will approve very cordially of my attempt to\r\nintroduce organ-building into the _curriculum_ of Roughborough, but I\r\nwill see what I can do with him, for I have set my heart on owning an\r\norgan built by Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s own hands, which he may play on as much as he\r\nlikes while it remains in my house and which I will lend him\r\npermanently as soon as he gets one of his own, but which is to be my\r\nproperty for the present, inasmuch as I mean to pay for it.\xe2\x80\x9d This was\r\nput in to make it plain to Theobald and Christina that they should not\r\nbe out of pocket in the matter.\r\n\r\nIf Alethea had been as poor as the Misses Allaby, the reader may guess\r\nwhat Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s papa and mamma would have said to this proposal; but\r\nthen, if she had been as poor as they, she would never have made it.\r\nThey did not like Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s getting more and more into his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s good\r\nbooks, still it was perhaps better that he should do so than that she\r\nshould be driven back upon the John Pontifexes. The only thing, said\r\nTheobald, which made him hesitate, was that the boy might be thrown\r\nwith low associates later on if he were to be encouraged in his taste\r\nfor music\xe2\x80\x94a taste which Theobald had always disliked. He had observed\r\nwith regret that Ernest had ere now shown rather a hankering after low\r\ncompany, and he might make acquaintance with those who would corrupt\r\nhis innocence. Christina shuddered at this, but when they had aired\r\ntheir scruples sufficiently they felt (and when people begin to \xe2\x80\x9cfeel,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthey are invariably going to take what they believe to be the more\r\nworldly course) that to oppose Alethea\xe2\x80\x99s proposal would be injuring\r\ntheir son\xe2\x80\x99s prospects more than was right, so they consented, but not\r\ntoo graciously.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, however, Christina got used to the idea, and then\r\nconsiderations occurred to her which made her throw herself into it\r\nwith characteristic ardour. If Miss Pontifex had been a railway stock\r\nshe might have been said to have been buoyant in the Battersby market\r\nfor some few days; buoyant for long together she could never be, still\r\nfor a time there really was an upward movement. Christina\xe2\x80\x99s mind\r\nwandered to the organ itself; she seemed to have made it with her own\r\nhands; there would be no other in England to compare with it for\r\ncombined sweetness and power. She already heard the famous Dr Walmisley\r\nof Cambridge mistaking it for a Father Smith. It would come, no doubt,\r\nin reality to Battersby Church, which wanted an organ, for it must be\r\nall nonsense about Alethea\xe2\x80\x99s wishing to keep it, and Ernest would not\r\nhave a house of his own for ever so many years, and they could never\r\nhave it at the Rectory. Oh, no! Battersby Church was the only proper\r\nplace for it.\r\n\r\nOf course, they would have a grand opening, and the Bishop would come\r\ndown, and perhaps young Figgins might be on a visit to them\xe2\x80\x94she must\r\nask Ernest if young Figgins had yet left Roughborough\xe2\x80\x94he might even\r\npersuade his grandfather Lord Lonsford to be present. Lord Lonsford and\r\nthe Bishop and everyone else would then compliment her, and Dr Wesley\r\nor Dr Walmisley, who should preside (it did not much matter which),\r\nwould say to her, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Mrs Pontifex, I never yet played upon so\r\nremarkable an instrument.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she would give him one of her very\r\nsweetest smiles and say she feared he was flattering her, on which he\r\nwould rejoin with some pleasant little trifle about remarkable men (the\r\nremarkable man being for the moment Ernest) having invariably had\r\nremarkable women for their mothers\xe2\x80\x94and so on and so on. The advantage\r\nof doing one\xe2\x80\x99s praising for oneself is that one can lay it on so thick\r\nand exactly in the right places.\r\n\r\nTheobald wrote Ernest a short and surly letter _\xc3\xa0 propos_ of his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nintentions in this matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not commit myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto an opinion whether anything\r\nwill come of it; this will depend entirely upon your own exertions; you\r\nhave had singular advantages hitherto, and your kind aunt is showing\r\nevery desire to befriend you, but you must give greater proof of\r\nstability and steadiness of character than you have given yet if this\r\norgan matter is not to prove in the end to be only one disappointment\r\nthe more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must insist on two things: firstly that this new iron in the fire\r\ndoes not distract your attention from your Latin and Greek\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94(\xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\naren\xe2\x80\x99t mine,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ernest, \xe2\x80\x9cand never have been\xe2\x80\x9d)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand secondly,\r\nthat you bring no smell of glue or shavings into the house here, if you\r\nmake any part of the organ during your holidays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest was still too young to know how unpleasant a letter he was\r\nreceiving. He believed the innuendoes contained in it to be perfectly\r\njust. He knew he was sadly deficient in perseverance. He liked some\r\nthings for a little while, and then found he did not like them any\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x94and this was as bad as anything well could be. His father\xe2\x80\x99s letter\r\ngave him one of his many fits of melancholy over his own worthlessness,\r\nbut the thought of the organ consoled him, and he felt sure that here\r\nat any rate was something to which he could apply himself steadily\r\nwithout growing tired of it.\r\n\r\nIt was settled that the organ was not to be begun before the Christmas\r\nholidays were over, and that till then Ernest should do a little plain\r\ncarpentering, so as to get to know how to use his tools. Miss Pontifex\r\nhad a carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s bench set up in an outhouse upon her own premises,\r\nand made terms with the most respectable carpenter in Roughborough, by\r\nwhich one of his men was to come for a couple of hours twice a week and\r\nset Ernest on the right way; then she discovered she wanted this or\r\nthat simple piece of work done, and gave the boy a commission to do it,\r\npaying him handsomely as well as finding him in tools and materials.\r\nShe never gave him a syllable of good advice, or talked to him about\r\neverything\xe2\x80\x99s depending upon his own exertions, but she kissed him\r\noften, and would come into the workshop and act the part of one who\r\ntook an interest in what was being done so cleverly as ere long to\r\nbecome really interested.\r\n\r\nWhat boy would not take kindly to almost anything with such assistance?\r\nAll boys like making things; the exercise of sawing, planing and\r\nhammering, proved exactly what his aunt had wanted to find\xe2\x80\x94something\r\nthat should exercise, but not too much, and at the same time amuse him;\r\nwhen Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s sallow face was flushed with his work, and his eyes were\r\nsparkling with pleasure, he looked quite a different boy from the one\r\nhis aunt had taken in hand only a few months earlier. His inner self\r\nnever told him that this was humbug, as it did about Latin and Greek.\r\nMaking stools and drawers was worth living for, and after Christmas\r\nthere loomed the organ, which was scarcely ever absent from his mind.\r\n\r\nHis aunt let him invite his friends, encouraging him to bring those\r\nwhom her quick sense told her were the most desirable. She smartened\r\nhim up also in his personal appearance, always without preaching to\r\nhim. Indeed she worked wonders during the short time that was allowed\r\nher, and if her life had been spared I cannot think that my hero would\r\nhave come under the shadow of that cloud which cast so heavy a gloom\r\nover his younger manhood; but unfortunately for him his gleam of\r\nsunshine was too hot and too brilliant to last, and he had many a storm\r\nyet to weather, before he became fairly happy. For the present,\r\nhowever, he was supremely so, and his aunt was happy and grateful for\r\nhis happiness, the improvement she saw in him, and his unrepressed\r\naffection for herself. She became fonder of him from day to day in\r\nspite of his many faults and almost incredible foolishnesses. It was\r\nperhaps on account of these very things that she saw how much he had\r\nneed of her; but at any rate, from whatever cause, she became\r\nstrengthened in her determination to be to him in the place of parents,\r\nand to find in him a son rather than a nephew. But still she made no\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nAll went well for the first part of the following half year. Miss\r\nPontifex spent the greater part of her holidays in London, and I also\r\nsaw her at Roughborough, where I spent a few days, staying at the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwan.\xe2\x80\x9d I heard all about my godson in whom, however, I took less\r\ninterest than I said I did. I took more interest in the stage at that\r\ntime than in anything else, and as for Ernest, I found him a nuisance\r\nfor engrossing so much of his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s attention, and taking her so much\r\nfrom London. The organ was begun, and made fair progress during the\r\nfirst two months of the half year. Ernest was happier than he had ever\r\nbeen before, and was struggling upwards. The best boys took more notice\r\nof him for his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and he consorted less with those who led\r\nhim into mischief.\r\n\r\nBut much as Miss Pontifex had done, she could not all at once undo the\r\neffect of such surroundings as the boy had had at Battersby. Much as he\r\nfeared and disliked his father (though he still knew not how much this\r\nwas), he had caught much from him; if Theobald had been kinder Ernest\r\nwould have modelled himself upon him entirely, and ere long would\r\nprobably have become as thorough a little prig as could have easily\r\nbeen found.\r\n\r\nFortunately his temper had come to him from his mother, who, when not\r\nfrightened, and when there was nothing on the horizon which might cross\r\nthe slightest whim of her husband, was an amiable, good-natured woman.\r\nIf it was not such an awful thing to say of anyone, I should say that\r\nshe meant well.\r\n\r\nErnest had also inherited his mother\xe2\x80\x99s love of building castles in the\r\nair, and\xe2\x80\x94so I suppose it must be called\xe2\x80\x94her vanity. He was very fond of\r\nshowing off, and, provided he could attract attention, cared little\r\nfrom whom it came, nor what it was for. He caught up, parrot-like,\r\nwhatever jargon he heard from his elders, which he thought was the\r\ncorrect thing, and aired it in season and out of season, as though it\r\nwere his own.\r\n\r\nMiss Pontifex was old enough and wise enough to know that this is the\r\nway in which even the greatest men as a general rule begin to develop,\r\nand was more pleased with his receptiveness and reproductiveness than\r\nalarmed at the things he caught and reproduced.\r\n\r\nShe saw that he was much attached to herself, and trusted to this\r\nrather than to anything else. She saw also that his conceit was not\r\nvery profound, and that his fits of self-abasement were as extreme as\r\nhis exaltation had been. His impulsiveness and sanguine trustfulness in\r\nanyone who smiled pleasantly at him, or indeed was not absolutely\r\nunkind to him, made her more anxious about him than any other point in\r\nhis character; she saw clearly that he would have to find himself\r\nrudely undeceived many a time and oft, before he would learn to\r\ndistinguish friend from foe within reasonable time. It was her\r\nperception of this which led her to take the action which she was so\r\nsoon called upon to take.\r\n\r\nHer health was for the most part excellent, and she had never had a\r\nserious illness in her life. One morning, however, soon after Easter\r\n1850, she awoke feeling seriously unwell. For some little time there\r\nhad been a talk of fever in the neighbourhood, but in those days the\r\nprecautions that ought to be taken against the spread of infection were\r\nnot so well understood as now, and nobody did anything. In a day or two\r\nit became plain that Miss Pontifex had got an attack of typhoid fever\r\nand was dangerously ill. On this she sent off a messenger to town, and\r\ndesired him not to return without her lawyer and myself.\r\n\r\nWe arrived on the afternoon of the day on which we had been summoned,\r\nand found her still free from delirium: indeed, the cheery way in which\r\nshe received us made it difficult to think she could be in danger. She\r\nat once explained her wishes, which had reference, as I expected, to\r\nher nephew, and repeated the substance of what I have already referred\r\nto as her main source of uneasiness concerning him. Then she begged me\r\nby our long and close intimacy, by the suddenness of the danger that\r\nhad fallen on her and her powerlessness to avert it, to undertake what\r\nshe said she well knew, if she died, would be an unpleasant and\r\ninvidious trust.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to leave the bulk of her money ostensibly to me, but in\r\nreality to her nephew, so that I should hold it in trust for him till\r\nhe was twenty-eight years old, but neither he nor anyone else, except\r\nher lawyer and myself, was to know anything about it. She would leave\r\n\xc2\xa35000 in other legacies, and \xc2\xa315,000 to Ernest\xe2\x80\x94which by the time he was\r\ntwenty-eight would have accumulated to, say, \xc2\xa330,000. \xe2\x80\x9cSell out the\r\ndebentures,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the money now is\xe2\x80\x94and put it into Midland\r\nOrdinary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him make his mistakes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cupon the money his grandfather\r\nleft him. I am no prophet, but even I can see that it will take that\r\nboy many years to see things as his neighbours see them. He will get no\r\nhelp from his father and mother, who would never forgive him for his\r\ngood luck if I left him the money outright; I daresay I am wrong, but I\r\nthink he will have to lose the greater part or all of what he has,\r\nbefore he will know how to keep what he will get from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSupposing he went bankrupt before he was twenty-eight years old, the\r\nmoney was to be mine absolutely, but she could trust me, she said, to\r\nhand it over to Ernest in due time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI am mistaken, the worst that can happen is that\r\nhe will come into a larger sum at twenty-eight instead of a smaller sum\r\nat, say, twenty-three, for I would never trust him with it earlier,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94if he knows nothing about it he will not be unhappy for the want of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe begged me to take \xc2\xa32000 in return for the trouble I should have in\r\ntaking charge of the boy\xe2\x80\x99s estate, and as a sign of the testatrix\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhope that I would now and again look after him while he was still\r\nyoung. The remaining \xc2\xa33000 I was to pay in legacies and annuities to\r\nfriends and servants.\r\n\r\nIn vain both her lawyer and myself remonstrated with her on the unusual\r\nand hazardous nature of this arrangement. We told her that sensible\r\npeople will not take a more sanguine view concerning human nature than\r\nthe Courts of Chancery do. We said, in fact, everything that anyone\r\nelse would say. She admitted everything, but urged that her time was\r\nshort, that nothing would induce her to leave her money to her nephew\r\nin the usual way. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is an unusually foolish will,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he\r\nis an unusually foolish boy;\xe2\x80\x9d and she smiled quite merrily at her\r\nlittle sally. Like all the rest of her family, she was very stubborn\r\nwhen her mind was made up. So the thing was done as she wished it.\r\n\r\nNo provision was made for either my death or Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94Miss Pontifex had\r\nsettled it that we were neither of us going to die, and was too ill to\r\ngo into details; she was so anxious, moreover, to sign her will while\r\nstill able to do so that we had practically no alternative but to do as\r\nshe told us. If she recovered we could see things put on a more\r\nsatisfactory footing, and further discussion would evidently impair her\r\nchances of recovery; it seemed then only too likely that it was a case\r\nof this will or no will at all.\r\n\r\nWhen the will was signed I wrote a letter in duplicate, saying that I\r\nheld all Miss Pontifex had left me in trust for Ernest except as\r\nregards \xc2\xa35000, but that he was not to come into the bequest, and was to\r\nknow nothing whatever about it directly or indirectly, till he was\r\ntwenty-eight years old, and if he was bankrupt before he came into it\r\nthe money was to be mine absolutely. At the foot of each letter Miss\r\nPontifex wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cThe above was my understanding when I made my will,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand then signed her name. The solicitor and his clerk witnessed; I kept\r\none copy myself and handed the other to Miss Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s solicitor.\r\n\r\nWhen all this had been done she became more easy in her mind. She\r\ntalked principally about her nephew. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t scold him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nhe is volatile, and continually takes things up only to throw them down\r\nagain. How can he find out his strength or weakness otherwise? A man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprofession,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and here she gave one of her wicked little\r\nlaughs, \xe2\x80\x9cis not like his wife, which he must take once for all, for\r\nbetter for worse, without proof beforehand. Let him go here and there,\r\nand learn his truest liking by finding out what, after all, he catches\r\nhimself turning to most habitually\xe2\x80\x94then let him stick to this; but I\r\ndaresay Ernest will be forty or five and forty before he settles down.\r\nThen all his previous infidelities will work together to him for good\r\nif he is the boy I hope he is.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbove all,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not let him work up to his full\r\nstrength, except once or twice in his lifetime; nothing is well done\r\nnor worth doing unless, take it all round, it has come pretty easily.\r\nTheobald and Christina would give him a pinch of salt and tell him to\r\nput it on the tails of the seven deadly virtues;\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here she laughed\r\nagain in her old manner at once so mocking and so sweet\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI think if he\r\nlikes pancakes he had perhaps better eat them on Shrove Tuesday, but\r\nthis is enough.\xe2\x80\x9d These were the last coherent words she spoke. From\r\nthat time she grew continually worse, and was never free from delirium\r\ntill her death\xe2\x80\x94which took place less than a fortnight afterwards, to\r\nthe inexpressible grief of those who knew and loved her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters had been written to Miss Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s brothers and sisters, and\r\none and all came post-haste to Roughborough. Before they arrived the\r\npoor lady was already delirious, and for the sake of her own peace at\r\nthe last I am half glad she never recovered consciousness.\r\n\r\nI had known these people all their lives, as none can know each other\r\nbut those who have played together as children; I knew how they had all\r\nof them\xe2\x80\x94perhaps Theobald least, but all of them more or less\xe2\x80\x94made her\r\nlife a burden to her until the death of her father had made her her own\r\nmistress, and I was displeased at their coming one after the other to\r\nRoughborough, and inquiring whether their sister had recovered\r\nconsciousness sufficiently to be able to see them. It was known that\r\nshe had sent for me on being taken ill, and that I remained at\r\nRoughborough, and I own I was angered by the mingled air of suspicion,\r\ndefiance and inquisitiveness, with which they regarded me. They would\r\nall, except Theobald, I believe have cut me downright if they had not\r\nbelieved me to know something they wanted to know themselves, and might\r\nhave some chance of learning from me\xe2\x80\x94for it was plain I had been in\r\nsome way concerned with the making of their sister\xe2\x80\x99s will. None of them\r\nsuspected what the ostensible nature of this would be, but I think they\r\nfeared Miss Pontifex was about to leave money for public uses. John\r\nsaid to me in his blandest manner that he fancied he remembered to have\r\nheard his sister say that she thought of leaving money to found a\r\ncollege for the relief of dramatic authors in distress; to this I made\r\nno rejoinder, and I have no doubt his suspicions were deepened.\r\n\r\nWhen the end came, I got Miss Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s solicitor to write and tell\r\nher brothers and sisters how she had left her money: they were not\r\nunnaturally furious, and went each to his or her separate home without\r\nattending the funeral, and without paying any attention to myself. This\r\nwas perhaps the kindest thing they could have done by me, for their\r\nbehaviour made me so angry that I became almost reconciled to Alethea\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwill out of pleasure at the anger it had aroused. But for this I should\r\nhave felt the will keenly, as having been placed by it in the position\r\nwhich of all others I had been most anxious to avoid, and as having\r\nsaddled me with a very heavy responsibility. Still it was impossible\r\nfor me to escape, and I could only let things take their course.\r\n\r\nMiss Pontifex had expressed a wish to be buried at Paleham; in the\r\ncourse of the next few days I therefore took the body thither. I had\r\nnot been to Paleham since the death of my father some six years\r\nearlier. I had often wished to go there, but had shrunk from doing so\r\nthough my sister had been two or three times. I could not bear to see\r\nthe house which had been my home for so many years of my life in the\r\nhands of strangers; to ring ceremoniously at a bell which I had never\r\nyet pulled except as a boy in jest; to feel that I had nothing to do\r\nwith a garden in which I had in childhood gathered so many a nosegay,\r\nand which had seemed my own for many years after I had reached man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nestate; to see the rooms bereft of every familiar feature, and made so\r\nunfamiliar in spite of their familiarity. Had there been any sufficient\r\nreason, I should have taken these things as a matter of course, and\r\nshould no doubt have found them much worse in anticipation than in\r\nreality, but as there had been no special reason why I should go to\r\nPaleham I had hitherto avoided doing so. Now, however, my going was a\r\nnecessity, and I confess I never felt more subdued than I did on\r\narriving there with the dead playmate of my childhood.\r\n\r\nI found the village more changed than I had expected. The railway had\r\ncome there, and a brand new yellow brick station was on the site of old\r\nMr and Mrs Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s cottage. Nothing but the carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s shop was now\r\nstanding. I saw many faces I knew, but even in six years they seemed to\r\nhave grown wonderfully older. Some of the very old were dead, and the\r\nold were getting very old in their stead. I felt like the changeling in\r\nthe fairy story who came back after a seven years\xe2\x80\x99 sleep. Everyone\r\nseemed glad to see me, though I had never given them particular cause\r\nto be so, and everyone who remembered old Mr and Mrs Pontifex spoke\r\nwarmly of them and were pleased at their granddaughter\xe2\x80\x99s wishing to be\r\nlaid near them. Entering the churchyard and standing in the twilight of\r\na gusty cloudy evening on the spot close beside old Mrs Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrave which I had chosen for Alethea\xe2\x80\x99s, I thought of the many times\r\nthat she, who would lie there henceforth, and I, who must surely lie\r\none day in some such another place though when and where I knew not,\r\nhad romped over this very spot as childish lovers together. Next\r\nmorning I followed her to the grave, and in due course set up a plain\r\nupright slab to her memory as like as might be to those over the graves\r\nof her grandmother and grandfather. I gave the dates and places of her\r\nbirth and death, but added nothing except that this stone was set up by\r\none who had known and loved her. Knowing how fond she had been of music\r\nI had been half inclined at one time to inscribe a few bars of music,\r\nif I could find any which seemed suitable to her character, but I knew\r\nhow much she would have disliked anything singular in connection with\r\nher tombstone and did not do it.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, I had come to this conclusion, I had thought that\r\nErnest might be able to help me to the right thing, and had written to\r\nhim upon the subject. The following is the answer I received\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Godpapa,\xe2\x80\x94I send you the best bit I can think of; it is the\r\nsubject of the last of Handel\xe2\x80\x99s six grand fugues and goes thus:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt would do better for a man, especially for an old man who was very\r\nsorry for things, than for a woman, but I cannot think of anything\r\nbetter; if you do not like it for Aunt Alethea I shall keep it for\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x94Your affectionate Godson,\r\n\r\n\r\nERNEST PONTIFEX.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWas this the little lad who could get sweeties for two-pence but not\r\nfor two-pence-halfpenny? Dear, dear me, I thought to myself, how these\r\nbabes and sucklings do give us the go-by surely. Choosing his own\r\nepitaph at fifteen as for a man who \xe2\x80\x9chad been very sorry for things,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand such a strain as that\xe2\x80\x94why it might have done for Leonardo da Vinci\r\nhimself. Then I set the boy down as a conceited young jackanapes, which\r\nno doubt he was,\xe2\x80\x94but so are a great many other young people of Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Theobald and Christina had not been too well pleased when Miss\r\nPontifex first took Ernest in hand, they were still less so when the\r\nconnection between the two was interrupted so prematurely. They said\r\nthey had made sure from what their sister had said that she was going\r\nto make Ernest her heir. I do not think she had given them so much as a\r\nhint to this effect. Theobald indeed gave Ernest to understand that she\r\nhad done so in a letter which will be given shortly, but if Theobald\r\nwanted to make himself disagreeable, a trifle light as air would\r\nforthwith assume in his imagination whatever form was most convenient\r\nto him. I do not think they had even made up their minds what Alethea\r\nwas to do with her money before they knew of her being at the point of\r\ndeath, and as I have said already, if they had thought it likely that\r\nErnest would be made heir over their own heads without their having at\r\nany rate a life interest in the bequest, they would have soon thrown\r\nobstacles in the way of further intimacy between aunt and nephew.\r\n\r\nThis, however, did not bar their right to feeling aggrieved now that\r\nneither they nor Ernest had taken anything at all, and they could\r\nprofess disappointment on their boy\xe2\x80\x99s behalf which they would have been\r\ntoo proud to admit upon their own. In fact, it was only amiable of them\r\nto be disappointed under these circumstances.\r\n\r\nChristina said that the will was simply fraudulent, and was convinced\r\nthat it could be upset if she and Theobald went the right way to work.\r\nTheobald, she said, should go before the Lord Chancellor, not in full\r\ncourt but in chambers, where he could explain the whole matter; or,\r\nperhaps it would be even better if she were to go herself\xe2\x80\x94and I dare\r\nnot trust myself to describe the reverie to which this last idea gave\r\nrise. I believe in the end Theobald died, and the Lord Chancellor (who\r\nhad become a widower a few weeks earlier) made her an offer, which,\r\nhowever, she firmly but not ungratefully declined; she should ever, she\r\nsaid, continue to think of him as a friend\xe2\x80\x94at this point the cook came\r\nin, saying the butcher had called, and what would she please to order.\r\n\r\nI think Theobald must have had an idea that there was something behind\r\nthe bequest to me, but he said nothing about it to Christina. He was\r\nangry and felt wronged, because he could not get at Alethea to give her\r\na piece of his mind any more than he had been able to get at his\r\nfather. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is so mean of people,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cto inflict\r\nan injury of this sort, and then shirk facing those whom they have\r\ninjured; let us hope that, at any rate, they and I may meet in Heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBut of this he was doubtful, for when people had done so great a wrong\r\nas this, it was hardly to be supposed that they would go to Heaven at\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94and as for his meeting them in another place, the idea never so\r\nmuch as entered his mind.\r\n\r\nOne so angry and, of late, so little used to contradiction might be\r\ntrusted, however, to avenge himself upon someone, and Theobald had long\r\nsince developed the organ, by means of which he might vent spleen with\r\nleast risk and greatest satisfaction to himself. This organ, it may be\r\nguessed, was nothing else than Ernest; to Ernest therefore he proceeded\r\nto unburden himself, not personally, but by letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to know,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your Aunt Alethea had given your\r\nmother and me to understand that it was her wish to make you her\r\nheir\xe2\x80\x94in the event, of course, of your conducting yourself in such a\r\nmanner as to give her confidence in you; as a matter of fact, however,\r\nshe has left you nothing, and the whole of her property has gone to\r\nyour godfather, Mr Overton. Your mother and I are willing to hope that\r\nif she had lived longer you would yet have succeeded in winning her\r\ngood opinion, but it is too late to think of this now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe carpentering and organ-building must at once be discontinued. I\r\nnever believed in the project, and have seen no reason to alter my\r\noriginal opinion. I am not sorry for your own sake, that it is to be at\r\nan end, nor, I am sure, will you regret it yourself in after years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA few words more as regards your own prospects. You have, as I believe\r\nyou know, a small inheritance, which is yours legally under your\r\ngrandfather\xe2\x80\x99s will. This bequest was made inadvertently, and, I\r\nbelieve, entirely through a misunderstanding on the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s part. The\r\nbequest was probably intended not to take effect till after the death\r\nof your mother and myself; nevertheless, as the will is actually\r\nworded, it will now be at your command if you live to be twenty-one\r\nyears old. From this, however, large deductions must be made. There\r\nwill be legacy duty, and I do not know whether I am not entitled to\r\ndeduct the expenses of your education and maintenance from birth to\r\nyour coming of age; I shall not in all likelihood insist on this right\r\nto the full, if you conduct yourself properly, but a considerable sum\r\nshould certainly be deducted, there will therefore remain very\r\nlittle\xe2\x80\x94say \xc2\xa31000 or \xc2\xa32000 at the outside, as what will be actually\r\nyours\xe2\x80\x94but the strictest account shall be rendered you in due time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis, let me warn you most seriously, is all that you must expect from\r\nme (even Ernest saw that it was not from Theobald at all) at any rate\r\ntill after my death, which for aught any of us know may be yet many\r\nyears distant. It is not a large sum, but it is sufficient if\r\nsupplemented by steadiness and earnestness of purpose. Your mother and\r\nI gave you the name Ernest, hoping that it would remind you continually\r\nof\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d but I really cannot copy more of this effusion. It was all the\r\nsame old will-shaking game and came practically to this, that Ernest\r\nwas no good, and that if he went on as he was going on now, he would\r\nprobably have to go about the streets begging without any shoes or\r\nstockings soon after he had left school, or at any rate, college; and\r\nthat he, Theobald, and Christina were almost too good for this world\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nAfter he had written this Theobald felt quite good-natured, and sent to\r\nthe Mrs Thompson of the moment even more soup and wine than her usual\r\nnot illiberal allowance.\r\n\r\nErnest was deeply, passionately upset by his father\xe2\x80\x99s letter; to think\r\nthat even his dear aunt, the one person of his relations whom he really\r\nloved, should have turned against him and thought badly of him after\r\nall. This was the unkindest cut of all. In the hurry of her illness\r\nMiss Pontifex, while thinking only of his welfare, had omitted to make\r\nsuch small present mention of him as would have made his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninnuendoes stingless; and her illness being infectious, she had not\r\nseen him after its nature was known. I myself did not know of\r\nTheobald\xe2\x80\x99s letter, nor think enough about my godson to guess what might\r\neasily be his state. It was not till many years afterwards that I found\r\nTheobald\xe2\x80\x99s letter in the pocket of an old portfolio which Ernest had\r\nused at school, and in which other old letters and school documents\r\nwere collected which I have used in this book. He had forgotten that he\r\nhad it, but told me when he saw it that he remembered it as the first\r\nthing that made him begin to rise against his father in a rebellion\r\nwhich he recognised as righteous, though he dared not openly avow it.\r\nNot the least serious thing was that it would, he feared, be his duty\r\nto give up the legacy his grandfather had left him; for if it was his\r\nonly through a mistake, how could he keep it?\r\n\r\nDuring the rest of the half year Ernest was listless and unhappy. He\r\nwas very fond of some of his schoolfellows, but afraid of those whom he\r\nbelieved to be better than himself, and prone to idealise everyone into\r\nbeing his superior except those who were obviously a good deal beneath\r\nhim. He held himself much too cheap, and because he was without that\r\nphysical strength and vigour which he so much coveted, and also because\r\nhe knew he shirked his lessons, he believed that he was without\r\nanything which could deserve the name of a good quality; he was\r\nnaturally bad, and one of those for whom there was no place for\r\nrepentance, though he sought it even with tears. So he shrank out of\r\nsight of those whom in his boyish way he idolised, never for a moment\r\nsuspecting that he might have capacities to the full as high as theirs\r\nthough of a different kind, and fell in more with those who were\r\nreputed of the baser sort, with whom he could at any rate be upon equal\r\nterms. Before the end of the half year he had dropped from the estate\r\nto which he had been raised during his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s stay at Roughborough, and\r\nhis old dejection, varied, however, with bursts of conceit rivalling\r\nthose of his mother, resumed its sway over him. \xe2\x80\x9cPontifex,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr\r\nSkinner, who had fallen upon him in hall one day like a moral landslip,\r\nbefore he had time to escape, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you never laugh? Do you always look\r\nso preternaturally grave?\xe2\x80\x9d The doctor had not meant to be unkind, but\r\nthe boy turned crimson, and escaped.\r\n\r\nThere was one place only where he was happy, and that was in the old\r\nchurch of St Michael, when his friend the organist was practising.\r\nAbout this time cheap editions of the great oratorios began to appear,\r\nand Ernest got them all as soon as they were published; he would\r\nsometimes sell a school-book to a second-hand dealer, and buy a number\r\nor two of the \xe2\x80\x9cMessiah,\xe2\x80\x9d or the \xe2\x80\x9cCreation,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cElijah,\xe2\x80\x9d with the\r\nproceeds. This was simply cheating his papa and mamma, but Ernest was\r\nfalling low again\xe2\x80\x94or thought he was\xe2\x80\x94and he wanted the music much, and\r\nthe Sallust, or whatever it was, little. Sometimes the organist would\r\ngo home, leaving his keys with Ernest, so that he could play by himself\r\nand lock up the organ and the church in time to get back for calling\r\nover. At other times, while his friend was playing, he would wander\r\nround the church, looking at the monuments and the old stained glass\r\nwindows, enchanted as regards both ears and eyes, at once. Once the old\r\nrector got hold of him as he was watching a new window being put in,\r\nwhich the rector had bought in Germany\xe2\x80\x94the work, it was supposed, of\r\nAlbert D\xc3\xbcrer. He questioned Ernest, and finding that he was fond of\r\nmusic, he said in his old trembling voice (for he was over eighty),\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you should have known Dr Burney who wrote the history of music. I\r\nknew him exceedingly well when I was a young man.\xe2\x80\x9d That made Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart beat, for he knew that Dr Burney, when a boy at school at\r\nChester, used to break bounds that he might watch Handel smoking his\r\npipe in the Exchange coffee house\xe2\x80\x94and now he was in the presence of one\r\nwho, if he had not seen Handel himself, had at least seen those who had\r\nseen him.\r\n\r\nThese were oases in his desert, but, as a general rule, the boy looked\r\nthin and pale, and as though he had a secret which depressed him, which\r\nno doubt he had, but for which I cannot blame him. He rose, in spite of\r\nhimself, higher in the school, but fell ever into deeper and deeper\r\ndisgrace with the masters, and did not gain in the opinion of those\r\nboys about whom he was persuaded that they could assuredly never know\r\nwhat it was to have a secret weighing upon their minds. This was what\r\nErnest felt so keenly; he did not much care about the boys who liked\r\nhim, and idolised some who kept him as far as possible at a distance,\r\nbut this is pretty much the case with all boys everywhere.\r\n\r\nAt last things reached a crisis, below which they could not very well\r\ngo, for at the end of the half year but one after his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s death,\r\nErnest brought back a document in his portmanteau, which Theobald\r\nstigmatised as \xe2\x80\x9cinfamous and outrageous.\xe2\x80\x9d I need hardly say I am\r\nalluding to his school bill.\r\n\r\nThis document was always a source of anxiety to Ernest, for it was gone\r\ninto with scrupulous care, and he was a good deal cross-examined about\r\nit. He would sometimes \xe2\x80\x9cwrite in\xe2\x80\x9d for articles necessary for his\r\neducation, such as a portfolio, or a dictionary, and sell the same, as\r\nI have explained, in order to eke out his pocket money, probably to buy\r\neither music or tobacco. These frauds were sometimes, as Ernest\r\nthought, in imminent danger of being discovered, and it was a load off\r\nhis breast when the cross-examination was safely over. This time\r\nTheobald had made a great fuss about the extras, but had grudgingly\r\npassed them; it was another matter, however, with the character and the\r\nmoral statistics, with which the bill concluded.\r\n\r\nThe page on which these details were to be found was as follows:\r\n\r\nREPORT OF THE CONDUCT AND PROGRESS OF ERNEST PONTIFEX.\r\nUPPER FIFTH FORM, HALF YEAR ENDING MIDSUMMER 1851\r\n\r\n\r\nClassics\xe2\x80\x94Idle, listless and unimproving.\r\nMathematics " " "\r\nDivinity " " "\r\nConduct in house.\xe2\x80\x94Orderly.\r\nGeneral Conduct\xe2\x80\x94Not satisfactory, on account of his great unpunctuality\r\nand inattention to duties.\r\nMonthly merit money 1s. 6d. 6d. 0d. 6d.

SKINNER, _Head-master_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nErnest was thus in disgrace from the beginning of the holidays, but an\r\nincident soon occurred which led him into delinquencies compared with\r\nwhich all his previous sins were venial.\r\n\r\nAmong the servants at the Rectory was a remarkably pretty girl named\r\nEllen. She came from Devonshire, and was the daughter of a fisherman\r\nwho had been drowned when she was a child. Her mother set up a small\r\nshop in the village where her husband had lived, and just managed to\r\nmake a living. Ellen remained with her till she was fourteen, when she\r\nfirst went out to service. Four years later, when she was about\r\neighteen, but so well grown that she might have passed for twenty, she\r\nhad been strongly recommended to Christina, who was then in want of a\r\nhousemaid, and had now been at Battersby about twelve months.\r\n\r\nAs I have said the girl was remarkably pretty; she looked the\r\nperfection of health and good temper, indeed there was a serene\r\nexpression upon her face which captivated almost all who saw her; she\r\nlooked as if matters had always gone well with her and were always\r\ngoing to do so, and as if no conceivable combination of circumstances\r\ncould put her for long together out of temper either with herself or\r\nwith anyone else. Her complexion was clear, but high; her eyes were\r\ngrey and beautifully shaped; her lips were full and restful, with\r\nsomething of an Egyptian Sphinx-like character about them. When I\r\nlearned that she came from Devonshire I fancied I saw a strain of far\r\naway Egyptian blood in her, for I had heard, though I know not what\r\nfoundation there was for the story, that the Egyptians made settlements\r\non the coast of Devonshire and Cornwall long before the Romans\r\nconquered Britain. Her hair was a rich brown, and her figure\xe2\x80\x94of about\r\nthe middle height\xe2\x80\x94perfect, but erring if at all on the side of\r\nrobustness. Altogether she was one of those girls about whom one is\r\ninclined to wonder how they can remain unmarried a week or a day\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nHer face (as indeed faces generally are, though I grant they lie\r\nsometimes) was a fair index to her disposition. She was good nature\r\nitself, and everyone in the house, not excluding I believe even\r\nTheobald himself after a fashion, was fond of her. As for Christina she\r\ntook the very warmest interest in her, and used to have her into the\r\ndining-room twice a week, and prepare her for confirmation (for by some\r\naccident she had never been confirmed) by explaining to her the\r\ngeography of Palestine and the routes taken by St Paul on his various\r\njourneys in Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nWhen Bishop Treadwell did actually come down to Battersby and hold a\r\nconfirmation there (Christina had her wish, he slept at Battersby, and\r\nshe had a grand dinner party for him, and called him \xe2\x80\x9cMy lord\xe2\x80\x9d several\r\ntimes), he was so much struck with her pretty face and modest demeanour\r\nwhen he laid his hands upon her that he asked Christina about her. When\r\nshe replied that Ellen was one of her own servants, the bishop seemed,\r\nso she thought or chose to think, quite pleased that so pretty a girl\r\nshould have found so exceptionally good a situation.\r\n\r\nErnest used to get up early during the holidays so that he might play\r\nthe piano before breakfast without disturbing his papa and mamma\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nrather, perhaps, without being disturbed by them. Ellen would generally\r\nbe there sweeping the drawing-room floor and dusting while he was\r\nplaying, and the boy, who was ready to make friends with most people,\r\nsoon became very fond of her. He was not as a general rule sensitive to\r\nthe charms of the fair sex, indeed he had hardly been thrown in with\r\nany women except his Aunts Allaby, and his Aunt Alethea, his mother,\r\nhis sister Charlotte and Mrs Jay; sometimes also he had had to take off\r\nhis hat to the Miss Skinners, and had felt as if he should sink into\r\nthe earth on doing so, but his shyness had worn off with Ellen, and the\r\npair had become fast friends.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was well that Ernest was not at home for very long together,\r\nbut as yet his affection though hearty was quite Platonic. He was not\r\nonly innocent, but deplorably\xe2\x80\x94I might even say guiltily\xe2\x80\x94innocent. His\r\npreference was based upon the fact that Ellen never scolded him, but\r\nwas always smiling and good tempered; besides she used to like to hear\r\nhim play, and this gave him additional zest in playing. The morning\r\naccess to the piano was indeed the one distinct advantage which the\r\nholidays had in Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, for at school he could not get at a\r\npiano except quasi-surreptitiously at the shop of Mr Pearsall, the\r\nmusic-seller.\r\n\r\nOn returning this midsummer he was shocked to find his favourite\r\nlooking pale and ill. All her good spirits had left her, the roses had\r\nfled from her cheek, and she seemed on the point of going into a\r\ndecline. She said she was unhappy about her mother, whose health was\r\nfailing, and was afraid she was herself not long for this world.\r\nChristina, of course, noticed the change. \xe2\x80\x9cI have often remarked,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cthat those very fresh-coloured, healthy-looking girls are the\r\nfirst to break up. I have given her calomel and James\xe2\x80\x99s powders\r\nrepeatedly, and though she does not like it, I think I must show her to\r\nDr Martin when he next comes here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Theobald, and so next time Dr Martin came\r\nEllen was sent for. Dr Martin soon discovered what would probably have\r\nbeen apparent to Christina herself if she had been able to conceive of\r\nsuch an ailment in connection with a servant who lived under the same\r\nroof as Theobald and herself\xe2\x80\x94the purity of whose married life should\r\nhave preserved all unmarried people who came near them from any taint\r\nof mischief.\r\n\r\nWhen it was discovered that in three or four months more Ellen would\r\nbecome a mother, Christina\xe2\x80\x99s natural good nature would have prompted\r\nher to deal as leniently with the case as she could, if she had not\r\nbeen panic-stricken lest any mercy on her and Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s part should be\r\nconstrued into toleration, however partial, of so great a sin; hereon\r\nshe dashed off into the conviction that the only thing to do was to pay\r\nEllen her wages, and pack her off on the instant bag and baggage out of\r\nthe house which purity had more especially and particularly singled out\r\nfor its abiding city. When she thought of the fearful contamination\r\nwhich Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s continued presence even for a week would occasion, she\r\ncould not hesitate.\r\n\r\nThen came the question\xe2\x80\x94horrid thought!\xe2\x80\x94as to who was the partner of\r\nEllen\xe2\x80\x99s guilt? Was it, could it be, her own son, her darling Ernest?\r\nErnest was getting a big boy now. She could excuse any young woman for\r\ntaking a fancy to him; as for himself, why she was sure he was behind\r\nno young man of his age in appreciation of the charms of a nice-looking\r\nyoung woman. So long as he was innocent she did not mind this, but oh,\r\nif he were guilty!\r\n\r\nShe could not bear to think of it, and yet it would be mere cowardice\r\nnot to look such a matter in the face\xe2\x80\x94her hope was in the Lord, and she\r\nwas ready to bear cheerfully and make the best of any suffering He\r\nmight think fit to lay upon her. That the baby must be either a boy or\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x94this much, at any rate, was clear. No less clear was it that the\r\nchild, if a boy, would resemble Theobald, and if a girl, herself.\r\nResemblance, whether of body or mind, generally leaped over a\r\ngeneration. The guilt of the parents must not be shared by the innocent\r\noffspring of shame\xe2\x80\x94oh! no\xe2\x80\x94and such a child as this would be . . . She\r\nwas off in one of her reveries at once.\r\n\r\nThe child was in the act of being consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury\r\nwhen Theobald came in from a visit in the parish, and was told of the\r\nshocking discovery.\r\n\r\nChristina said nothing about Ernest, and I believe was more than half\r\nangry when the blame was laid upon other shoulders. She was easily\r\nconsoled, however, and fell back on the double reflection, firstly,\r\nthat her son was pure, and secondly, that she was quite sure he would\r\nnot have been so had it not been for his religious convictions which\r\nhad held him back\xe2\x80\x94as, of course, it was only to be expected they would.\r\n\r\nTheobald agreed that no time must be lost in paying Ellen her wages and\r\npacking her off. So this was done, and less than two hours after Dr\r\nMartin had entered the house Ellen was sitting beside John the\r\ncoachman, with her face muffled up so that it could not be seen,\r\nweeping bitterly as she was being driven to the station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nErnest had been out all the morning, but came in to the yard of the\r\nRectory from the spinney behind the house just as Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s things were\r\nbeing put into the carriage. He thought it was Ellen whom he then saw\r\nget into the carriage, but as her face had been hidden by her\r\nhandkerchief he had not been able to see plainly who it was, and\r\ndismissed the idea as improbable.\r\n\r\nHe went to the back-kitchen window, at which the cook was standing\r\npeeling the potatoes for dinner, and found her crying bitterly. Ernest\r\nwas much distressed, for he liked the cook, and, of course, wanted to\r\nknow what all the matter was, who it was that had just gone off in the\r\npony carriage, and why? The cook told him it was Ellen, but said that\r\nno earthly power should make it cross her lips why it was she was going\r\naway; when, however, Ernest took her _au pied de la lettre_ and asked\r\nno further questions, she told him all about it after extorting the\r\nmost solemn promises of secrecy.\r\n\r\nIt took Ernest some minutes to arrive at the facts of the case, but\r\nwhen he understood them he leaned against the pump, which stood near\r\nthe back-kitchen window, and mingled his tears with the cook\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nThen his blood began to boil within him. He did not see that after all\r\nhis father and mother could have done much otherwise than they actually\r\ndid. They might perhaps have been less precipitate, and tried to keep\r\nthe matter a little more quiet, but this would not have been easy, nor\r\nwould it have mended things very materially. The bitter fact remains\r\nthat if a girl does certain things she must do them at her peril, no\r\nmatter how young and pretty she is nor to what temptation she has\r\nsuccumbed. This is the way of the world, and as yet there has been no\r\nhelp found for it.\r\n\r\nErnest could only see what he gathered from the cook, namely, that his\r\nfavourite, Ellen, was being turned adrift with a matter of three pounds\r\nin her pocket, to go she knew not where, and to do she knew not what,\r\nand that she had said she should hang or drown herself, which the boy\r\nimplicitly believed she would.\r\n\r\nWith greater promptitude than he had shown yet, he reckoned up his\r\nmoney and found he had two shillings and threepence at his command;\r\nthere was his knife which might sell for a shilling, and there was the\r\nsilver watch his Aunt Alethea had given him shortly before she died.\r\nThe carriage had been gone now a full quarter of an hour, and it must\r\nhave got some distance ahead, but he would do his best to catch it up,\r\nand there were short cuts which would perhaps give him a chance. He was\r\noff at once, and from the top of the hill just past the Rectory paddock\r\nhe could see the carriage, looking very small, on a bit of road which\r\nshowed perhaps a mile and a half in front of him.\r\n\r\nOne of the most popular amusements at Roughborough was an institution\r\ncalled \xe2\x80\x9cthe hounds\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94more commonly known elsewhere as \xe2\x80\x9chare and hounds,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbut in this case the hare was a couple of boys who were called foxes,\r\nand boys are so particular about correctness of nomenclature where\r\ntheir sports are concerned that I dare not say they played \xe2\x80\x9chare and\r\nhounds\xe2\x80\x9d; these were \xe2\x80\x9cthe hounds,\xe2\x80\x9d and that was all. Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s want of\r\nmuscular strength did not tell against him here; there was no jostling\r\nup against boys who, though neither older nor taller than he, were yet\r\nmore robustly built; if it came to mere endurance he was as good as any\r\none else, so when his carpentering was stopped he had naturally taken\r\nto \xe2\x80\x9cthe hounds\xe2\x80\x9d as his favourite amusement. His lungs thus exercised\r\nhad become developed, and as a run of six or seven miles across country\r\nwas not more than he was used to, he did not despair by the help of the\r\nshort cuts of overtaking the carriage, or at the worst of catching\r\nEllen at the station before the train left. So he ran and ran and ran\r\ntill his first wind was gone and his second came, and he could breathe\r\nmore easily. Never with \xe2\x80\x9cthe hounds\xe2\x80\x9d had he run so fast and with so few\r\nbreaks as now, but with all his efforts and the help of the short cuts\r\nhe did not catch up the carriage, and would probably not have done so\r\nhad not John happened to turn his head and seen him running and making\r\nsigns for the carriage to stop a quarter of a mile off. He was now\r\nabout five miles from home, and was nearly done up.\r\n\r\nHe was crimson with his exertion; covered with dust, and with his\r\ntrousers and coat sleeves a trifle short for him he cut a poor figure\r\nenough as he thrust on Ellen his watch, his knife, and the little money\r\nhe had. The one thing he implored of her was not to do those dreadful\r\nthings which she threatened\xe2\x80\x94for his sake if for no other reason.\r\n\r\nEllen at first would not hear of taking anything from him, but the\r\ncoachman, who was from the north country, sided with Ernest. \xe2\x80\x9cTake it,\r\nmy lass,\xe2\x80\x9d he said kindly, \xe2\x80\x9ctake what thou canst get whiles thou canst\r\nget it; as for Master Ernest here\xe2\x80\x94he has run well after thee; therefore\r\nlet him give thee what he is minded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEllen did what she was told, and the two parted with many tears, the\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s last words being that she should never forget him, and that they\r\nshould meet again hereafter, she was sure they should, and then she\r\nwould repay him.\r\n\r\nThen Ernest got into a field by the roadside, flung himself on the\r\ngrass, and waited under the shadow of a hedge till the carriage should\r\npass on its return from the station and pick him up, for he was dead\r\nbeat. Thoughts which had already occurred to him with some force now\r\ncame more strongly before him, and he saw that he had got himself into\r\none mess\xe2\x80\x94or rather into half-a-dozen messes\xe2\x80\x94the more.\r\n\r\nIn the first place he should be late for dinner, and this was one of\r\nthe offences on which Theobald had no mercy. Also he should have to say\r\nwhere he had been, and there was a danger of being found out if he did\r\nnot speak the truth. Not only this, but sooner or later it must come\r\nout that he was no longer possessed of the beautiful watch which his\r\ndear aunt had given him\xe2\x80\x94and what, pray, had he done with it, or how had\r\nhe lost it? The reader will know very well what he ought to have done.\r\nHe should have gone straight home, and if questioned should have said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been running after the carriage to catch our housemaid Ellen,\r\nwhom I am very fond of; I have given her my watch, my knife and all my\r\npocket money, so that I have now no pocket money at all and shall\r\nprobably ask you for some more sooner than I otherwise might have done,\r\nand you will also have to buy me a new watch and a knife.\xe2\x80\x9d But then\r\nfancy the consternation which such an announcement would have\r\noccasioned! Fancy the scowl and flashing eyes of the infuriated\r\nTheobald! \xe2\x80\x9cYou unprincipled young scoundrel,\xe2\x80\x9d he would exclaim, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you\r\nmean to vilify your own parents by implying that they have dealt\r\nharshly by one whose profligacy has disgraced their house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOr he might take it with one of those sallies of sarcastic calm, of\r\nwhich he believed himself to be a master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, Ernest, very well: I shall say nothing; you can please\r\nyourself; you are not yet twenty-one, but pray act as if you were your\r\nown master; your poor aunt doubtless gave you the watch that you might\r\nfling it away upon the first improper character you came across; I\r\nthink I can now understand, however, why she did not leave you her\r\nmoney; and, after all, your godfather may just as well have it as the\r\nkind of people on whom you would lavish it if it were yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen his mother would burst into tears and implore him to repent and\r\nseek the things belonging to his peace while there was yet time, by\r\nfalling on his knees to Theobald and assuring him of his unfailing love\r\nfor him as the kindest and tenderest father in the universe. Ernest\r\ncould do all this just as well as they could, and now, as he lay on the\r\ngrass, speeches, some one or other of which was as certain to come as\r\nthe sun to set, kept running in his head till they confuted the idea of\r\ntelling the truth by reducing it to an absurdity. Truth might be\r\nheroic, but it was not within the range of practical domestic politics.\r\n\r\nHaving settled then that he was to tell a lie, what lie should he tell?\r\nShould he say he had been robbed? He had enough imagination to know\r\nthat he had not enough imagination to carry him out here. Young as he\r\nwas, his instinct told him that the best liar is he who makes the\r\nsmallest amount of lying go the longest way\xe2\x80\x94who husbands it too\r\ncarefully to waste it where it can be dispensed with. The simplest\r\ncourse would be to say that he had lost the watch, and was late for\r\ndinner because he had been looking for it. He had been out for a long\r\nwalk\xe2\x80\x94he chose the line across the fields that he had actually taken\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthe weather being very hot, he had taken off his coat and waistcoat; in\r\ncarrying them over his arm his watch, his money, and his knife had\r\ndropped out of them. He had got nearly home when he found out his loss,\r\nand had run back as fast as he could, looking along the line he had\r\nfollowed, till at last he had given it up; seeing the carriage coming\r\nback from the station, he had let it pick him up and bring him home.\r\n\r\nThis covered everything, the running and all; for his face still showed\r\nthat he must have been running hard; the only question was whether he\r\nhad been seen about the Rectory by any but the servants for a couple of\r\nhours or so before Ellen had gone, and this he was happy to believe was\r\nnot the case; for he had been out except during his few minutes\xe2\x80\x99\r\ninterview with the cook. His father had been out in the parish; his\r\nmother had certainly not come across him, and his brother and sister\r\nhad also been out with the governess. He knew he could depend upon the\r\ncook and the other servants\xe2\x80\x94the coachman would see to this; on the\r\nwhole, therefore, both he and the coachman thought the story as\r\nproposed by Ernest would about meet the requirements of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Ernest got home and sneaked in through the back door, he heard his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s voice in its angriest tones, inquiring whether Master Ernest\r\nhad already returned. He felt as Jack must have felt in the story of\r\nJack and the Bean Stalk, when from the oven in which he was hidden he\r\nheard the ogre ask his wife what young children she had got for his\r\nsupper. With much courage, and, as the event proved, with not less\r\ncourage than discretion, he took the bull by the horns, and announced\r\nhimself at once as having just come in after having met with a terrible\r\nmisfortune. Little by little he told his story, and though Theobald\r\nstormed somewhat at his \xe2\x80\x9cincredible folly and carelessness,\xe2\x80\x9d he got off\r\nbetter than he expected. Theobald and Christina had indeed at first\r\nbeen inclined to connect his absence from dinner with Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndismissal, but on finding it clear, as Theobald said\xe2\x80\x94everything was\r\nalways clear with Theobald\xe2\x80\x94that Ernest had not been in the house all\r\nthe morning, and could therefore have known nothing of what had\r\nhappened, he was acquitted on this account for once in a way, without a\r\nstain upon his character. Perhaps Theobald was in a good temper; he may\r\nhave seen from the paper that morning that his stocks had been rising;\r\nit may have been this or twenty other things, but whatever it was, he\r\ndid not scold so much as Ernest had expected, and, seeing the boy look\r\nexhausted and believing him to be much grieved at the loss of his\r\nwatch, Theobald actually prescribed a glass of wine after his dinner,\r\nwhich, strange to say, did not choke him, but made him see things more\r\ncheerfully than was usual with him.\r\n\r\nThat night when he said his prayers, he inserted a few paragraphs to\r\nthe effect that he might not be discovered, and that things might go\r\nwell with Ellen, but he was anxious and ill at ease. His guilty\r\nconscience pointed out to him a score of weak places in his story,\r\nthrough any one of which detection might even yet easily enter. Next\r\nday and for many days afterwards he fled when no man was pursuing, and\r\ntrembled each time he heard his father\xe2\x80\x99s voice calling for him. He had\r\nalready so many causes of anxiety that he could stand little more, and\r\nin spite of all his endeavours to look cheerful, even his mother could\r\nsee that something was preying upon his mind. Then the idea returned to\r\nher that, after all, her son might not be innocent in the Ellen\r\nmatter\xe2\x80\x94and this was so interesting that she felt bound to get as near\r\nthe truth as she could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, my poor, pale-faced, heavy-eyed boy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to him one\r\nday in her kindest manner; \xe2\x80\x9ccome and sit down by me, and we will have a\r\nlittle quiet confidential talk together, will we not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy went mechanically to the sofa. Whenever his mother wanted what\r\nshe called a confidential talk with him she always selected the sofa as\r\nthe most suitable ground on which to open her campaign. All mothers do\r\nthis; the sofa is to them what the dining-room is to fathers. In the\r\npresent case the sofa was particularly well adapted for a strategic\r\npurpose, being an old-fashioned one with a high back, mattress,\r\nbolsters and cushions. Once safely penned into one of its deep corners,\r\nit was like a dentist\xe2\x80\x99s chair, not too easy to get out of again. Here\r\nshe could get at him better to pull him about, if this should seem\r\ndesirable, or if she thought fit to cry she could bury her head in the\r\nsofa cushion and abandon herself to an agony of grief which seldom\r\nfailed of its effect. None of her favourite manoeuvres were so easily\r\nadopted in her usual seat, the arm-chair on the right hand side of the\r\nfireplace, and so well did her son know from his mother\xe2\x80\x99s tone that\r\nthis was going to be a sofa conversation that he took his place like a\r\nlamb as soon as she began to speak and before she could reach the sofa\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest boy,\xe2\x80\x9d began his mother, taking hold of his hand and placing\r\nit within her own, \xe2\x80\x9cpromise me never to be afraid either of your dear\r\npapa or of me; promise me this, my dear, as you love me, promise it to\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d and she kissed him again and again and stroked his hair. But with\r\nher other hand she still kept hold of his; she had got him and she\r\nmeant to keep him.\r\n\r\nThe lad hung down his head and promised. What else could he do?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know there is no one, dear, dear Ernest, who loves you so much as\r\nyour papa and I do; no one who watches so carefully over your interests\r\nor who is so anxious to enter into all your little joys and troubles as\r\nwe are; but my dearest boy, it grieves me to think sometimes that you\r\nhave not that perfect love for and confidence in us which you ought to\r\nhave. You know, my darling, that it would be as much our pleasure as\r\nour duty to watch over the development of your moral and spiritual\r\nnature, but alas! you will not let us see your moral and spiritual\r\nnature. At times we are almost inclined to doubt whether you have a\r\nmoral and spiritual nature at all. Of your inner life, my dear, we know\r\nnothing beyond such scraps as we can glean in spite of you, from little\r\nthings which escape you almost before you know that you have said\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy winced at this. It made him feel hot and uncomfortable all\r\nover. He knew well how careful he ought to be, and yet, do what he\r\ncould, from time to time his forgetfulness of the part betrayed him\r\ninto unreserve. His mother saw that he winced, and enjoyed the scratch\r\nshe had given him. Had she felt less confident of victory she had\r\nbetter have foregone the pleasure of touching as it were the eyes at\r\nthe end of the snail\xe2\x80\x99s horns in order to enjoy seeing the snail draw\r\nthem in again\xe2\x80\x94but she knew that when she had got him well down into the\r\nsofa, and held his hand, she had the enemy almost absolutely at her\r\nmercy, and could do pretty much what she liked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa does not feel,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you love him with that\r\nfulness and unreserve which would prompt you to have no concealment\r\nfrom him, and to tell him everything freely and fearlessly as your most\r\nloving earthly friend next only to your Heavenly Father. Perfect love,\r\nas we know, casteth out fear: your father loves you perfectly, my\r\ndarling, but he does not feel as though you loved him perfectly in\r\nreturn. If you fear him it is because you do not love him as he\r\ndeserves, and I know it sometimes cuts him to the very heart to think\r\nthat he has earned from you a deeper and more willing sympathy than you\r\ndisplay towards him. Oh, Ernest, Ernest, do not grieve one who is so\r\ngood and noble-hearted by conduct which I can call by no other name\r\nthan ingratitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest could never stand being spoken to in this way by his mother: for\r\nhe still believed that she loved him, and that he was fond of her and\r\nhad a friend in her\xe2\x80\x94up to a certain point. But his mother was beginning\r\nto come to the end of her tether; she had played the domestic\r\nconfidence trick upon him times without number already. Over and over\r\nagain had she wheedled from him all she wanted to know, and afterwards\r\ngot him into the most horrible scrape by telling the whole to Theobald.\r\nErnest had remonstrated more than once upon these occasions, and had\r\npointed out to his mother how disastrous to him his confidences had\r\nbeen, but Christina had always joined issue with him and showed him in\r\nthe clearest possible manner that in each case she had been right, and\r\nthat he could not reasonably complain. Generally it was her conscience\r\nthat forbade her to be silent, and against this there was no appeal,\r\nfor we are all bound to follow the dictates of our conscience. Ernest\r\nused to have to recite a hymn about conscience. It was to the effect\r\nthat if you did not pay attention to its voice it would soon leave off\r\nspeaking. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mamma\xe2\x80\x99s conscience has not left off speaking,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nErnest to one of his chums at Roughborough; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s always jabbering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen a boy has once spoken so disrespectfully as this about his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s conscience it is practically all over between him and her.\r\nErnest through sheer force of habit, of the sofa, and of the return of\r\nthe associated ideas, was still so moved by the siren\xe2\x80\x99s voice as to\r\nyearn to sail towards her, and fling himself into her arms, but it\r\nwould not do; there were other associated ideas that returned also, and\r\nthe mangled bones of too many murdered confessions were lying whitening\r\nround the skirts of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s dress, to allow him by any possibility\r\nto trust her further. So he hung his head and looked sheepish, but kept\r\nhis own counsel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see, my dearest,\xe2\x80\x9d continued his mother, \xe2\x80\x9ceither that I am mistaken,\r\nand that there is nothing on your mind, or that you will not unburden\r\nyourself to me: but oh, Ernest, tell me at least this much; is there\r\nnothing that you repent of, nothing which makes you unhappy in\r\nconnection with that miserable girl Ellen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x99s heart failed him. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a dead boy now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself.\r\nHe had not the faintest conception what his mother was driving at, and\r\nthought she suspected about the watch; but he held his ground.\r\n\r\nI do not believe he was much more of a coward than his neighbours, only\r\nhe did not know that all sensible people are cowards when they are off\r\ntheir beat, or when they think they are going to be roughly handled. I\r\nbelieve, that if the truth were known, it would be found that even the\r\nvaliant St Michael himself tried hard to shirk his famous combat with\r\nthe dragon; he pretended not to see all sorts of misconduct on the\r\ndragon\xe2\x80\x99s part; shut his eyes to the eating up of I do not know how many\r\nhundreds of men, women and children whom he had promised to protect;\r\nallowed himself to be publicly insulted a dozen times over without\r\nresenting it; and in the end when even an angel could stand it no\r\nlonger he shilly-shallied and temporised an unconscionable time before\r\nhe would fix the day and hour for the encounter. As for the actual\r\ncombat it was much such another _wurra-wurra_ as Mrs Allaby had had\r\nwith the young man who had in the end married her eldest daughter, till\r\nafter a time behold, there was the dragon lying dead, while he was\r\nhimself alive and not very seriously hurt after all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know what you mean, mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ernest anxiously and\r\nmore or less hurriedly. His mother construed his manner into\r\nindignation at being suspected, and being rather frightened herself she\r\nturned tail and scuttled off as fast as her tongue could carry her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI see by your tone that you are innocent! Oh! oh! how\r\nI thank my heavenly Father for this; may He for His dear Son\xe2\x80\x99s sake\r\nkeep you always pure. Your father, my dear\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94(here she spoke hurriedly\r\nbut gave him a searching look) \xe2\x80\x9cwas as pure as a spotless angel when he\r\ncame to me. Like him, always be self-denying, truly truthful both in\r\nword and deed, never forgetful whose son and grandson you are, nor of\r\nthe name we gave you, of the sacred stream in whose waters your sins\r\nwere washed out of you through the blood and blessing of Christ,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.\r\n\r\nBut Ernest cut this\xe2\x80\x94I will not say short\xe2\x80\x94but a great deal shorter than\r\nit would have been if Christina had had her say out, by extricating\r\nhimself from his mamma\xe2\x80\x99s embrace and showing a clean pair of heels. As\r\nhe got near the purlieus of the kitchen (where he was more at ease) he\r\nheard his father calling for his mother, and again his guilty\r\nconscience rose against him. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has found all out now,\xe2\x80\x9d it cried, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nhe is going to tell mamma\xe2\x80\x94this time I am done for.\xe2\x80\x9d But there was\r\nnothing in it; his father only wanted the key of the cellaret. Then\r\nErnest slunk off into a coppice or spinney behind the Rectory paddock,\r\nand consoled himself with a pipe of tobacco. Here in the wood with the\r\nsummer sun streaming through the trees and a book and his pipe the boy\r\nforgot his cares and had an interval of that rest without which I\r\nverily believe his life would have been insupportable.\r\n\r\nOf course, Ernest was made to look for his lost property, and a reward\r\nwas offered for it, but it seemed he had wandered a good deal off the\r\npath, thinking to find a lark\xe2\x80\x99s nest, more than once, and looking for a\r\nwatch and purse on Battersby piewipes was very like looking for a\r\nneedle in a bundle of hay: besides it might have been found and taken\r\nby some tramp, or by a magpie of which there were many in the\r\nneighbourhood, so that after a week or ten days the search was\r\ndiscontinued, and the unpleasant fact had to be faced that Ernest must\r\nhave another watch, another knife, and a small sum of pocket money.\r\n\r\nIt was only right, however, that Ernest should pay half the cost of the\r\nwatch; this should be made easy for him, for it should be deducted from\r\nhis pocket money in half-yearly instalments extending over two, or even\r\nit might be three years. In Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s own interests, then, as well as\r\nthose of his father and mother, it would be well that the watch should\r\ncost as little as possible, so it was resolved to buy a second-hand\r\none. Nothing was to be said to Ernest, but it was to be bought, and\r\nlaid upon his plate as a surprise just before the holidays were over.\r\nTheobald would have to go to the county town in a few days, and could\r\nthen find some second-hand watch which would answer sufficiently well.\r\nIn the course of time, therefore, Theobald went, furnished with a long\r\nlist of household commissions, among which was the purchase of a watch\r\nfor Ernest.\r\n\r\nThose, as I have said, were always happy times, when Theobald was away\r\nfor a whole day certain; the boy was beginning to feel easy in his mind\r\nas though God had heard his prayers, and he was not going to be found\r\nout. Altogether the day had proved an unusually tranquil one, but,\r\nalas! it was not to close as it had begun; the fickle atmosphere in\r\nwhich he lived was never more likely to breed a storm than after such\r\nan interval of brilliant calm, and when Theobald returned Ernest had\r\nonly to look in his face to see that a hurricane was approaching.\r\n\r\nChristina saw that something had gone very wrong, and was quite\r\nfrightened lest Theobald should have heard of some serious money loss;\r\nhe did not, however, at once unbosom himself, but rang the bell and\r\nsaid to the servant, \xe2\x80\x9cTell Master Ernest I wish to speak to him in the\r\ndining-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\n\r\nLong before Ernest reached the dining-room his ill-divining soul had\r\ntold him that his sin had found him out. What head of a family ever\r\nsends for any of its members into the dining-room if his intentions are\r\nhonourable?\r\n\r\nWhen he reached it he found it empty\xe2\x80\x94his father having been called away\r\nfor a few minutes unexpectedly upon some parish business\xe2\x80\x94and he was\r\nleft in the same kind of suspense as people are in after they have been\r\nushered into their dentist\xe2\x80\x99s ante-room.\r\n\r\nOf all the rooms in the house he hated the dining-room worst. It was\r\nhere that he had had to do his Latin and Greek lessons with his father.\r\nIt had a smell of some particular kind of polish or varnish which was\r\nused in polishing the furniture, and neither I nor Ernest can even now\r\ncome within range of the smell of this kind of varnish without our\r\nhearts failing us.\r\n\r\nOver the chimney-piece there was a veritable old master, one of the few\r\noriginal pictures which Mr George Pontifex had brought from Italy. It\r\nwas supposed to be a Salvator Rosa, and had been bought as a great\r\nbargain. The subject was Elijah or Elisha (whichever it was) being fed\r\nby the ravens in the desert. There were the ravens in the upper\r\nright-hand corner with bread and meat in their beaks and claws, and\r\nthere was the prophet in question in the lower left-hand corner looking\r\nlongingly up towards them. When Ernest was a very small boy it had been\r\na constant matter of regret to him that the food which the ravens\r\ncarried never actually reached the prophet; he did not understand the\r\nlimitation of the painter\xe2\x80\x99s art, and wanted the meat and the prophet to\r\nbe brought into direct contact. One day, with the help of some steps\r\nwhich had been left in the room, he had clambered up to the picture and\r\nwith a piece of bread and butter traced a greasy line right across it\r\nfrom the ravens to Elisha\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, after which he had felt more\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x99s mind was drifting back to this youthful escapade when he heard\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s hand on the door, and in another second Theobald entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Ernest,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in an off-hand, rather cheery manner, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nlittle matter which I should like you to explain to me, as I have no\r\ndoubt you very easily can.\xe2\x80\x9d Thump, thump, thump, went Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s heart\r\nagainst his ribs; but his father\xe2\x80\x99s manner was so much nicer than usual\r\nthat he began to think it might be after all only another false alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt had occurred to your mother and myself that we should like to set\r\nyou up with a watch again before you went back to school\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ernest to himself quite relieved), \xe2\x80\x9cand I have been to-day\r\nto look out for a second-hand one which should answer every purpose so\r\nlong as you\xe2\x80\x99re at school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheobald spoke as if watches had half-a-dozen purposes besides\r\ntime-keeping, but he could hardly open his mouth without using one or\r\nother of his tags, and \xe2\x80\x9canswering every purpose\xe2\x80\x9d was one of them.\r\n\r\nErnest was breaking out into the usual expressions of gratitude, when\r\nTheobald continued, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are interrupting me,\xe2\x80\x9d and Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s heart\r\nthumped again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are interrupting me, Ernest. I have not yet done.\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest was\r\ninstantly dumb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI passed several shops with second-hand watches for sale, but I saw\r\nnone of a description and price which pleased me, till at last I was\r\nshown one which had, so the shopman said, been left with him recently\r\nfor sale, and which I at once recognised as the one which had been\r\ngiven you by your Aunt Alethea. Even if I had failed to recognise it,\r\nas perhaps I might have done, I should have identified it directly it\r\nreached my hands, inasmuch as it had \xe2\x80\x98E. P., a present from A. P.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nengraved upon the inside. I need say no more to show that this was the\r\nvery watch which you told your mother and me that you had dropped out\r\nof your pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUp to this time Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s manner had been studiously calm, and his\r\nwords had been uttered slowly, but here he suddenly quickened and flung\r\noff the mask as he added the words, \xe2\x80\x9cor some such cock and bull story,\r\nwhich your mother and I were too truthful to disbelieve. You can guess\r\nwhat must be our feelings now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest felt that this last home-thrust was just. In his less anxious\r\nmoments he had thought his papa and mamma \xe2\x80\x9cgreen\xe2\x80\x9d for the readiness\r\nwith which they believed him, but he could not deny that their\r\ncredulity was a proof of their habitual truthfulness of mind. In common\r\njustice he must own that it was very dreadful for two such truthful\r\npeople to have a son as untruthful as he knew himself to be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieving that a son of your mother and myself would be incapable of\r\nfalsehood I at once assumed that some tramp had picked the watch up and\r\nwas now trying to dispose of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis to the best of my belief was not accurate. Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s first\r\nassumption had been that it was Ernest who was trying to sell the\r\nwatch, and it was an inspiration of the moment to say that his\r\nmagnanimous mind had at once conceived the idea of a tramp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may imagine how shocked I was when I discovered that the watch had\r\nbeen brought for sale by that miserable woman Ellen\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart hardened a little, and he felt as near an approach to an instinct\r\nto turn as one so defenceless could be expected to feel; his father\r\nquickly perceived this and continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwho was turned out of this house\r\nin circumstances which I will not pollute your ears by more\r\nparticularly describing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI put aside the horrid conviction which was beginning to dawn upon me,\r\nand assumed that in the interval between her dismissal and her leaving\r\nthis house, she had added theft to her other sin, and having found your\r\nwatch in your bedroom had purloined it. It even occurred to me that you\r\nmight have missed your watch after the woman was gone, and, suspecting\r\nwho had taken it, had run after the carriage in order to recover it;\r\nbut when I told the shopman of my suspicions he assured me that the\r\nperson who left it with him had declared most solemnly that it had been\r\ngiven her by her master\xe2\x80\x99s son, whose property it was, and who had a\r\nperfect right to dispose of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told me further that, thinking the circumstances in which the watch\r\nwas offered for sale somewhat suspicious, he had insisted upon the\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s telling him the whole story of how she came by it, before he\r\nwould consent to buy it of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said that at first\xe2\x80\x94as women of that stamp invariably do\xe2\x80\x94she tried\r\nprevarication, but on being threatened that she should at once be given\r\ninto custody if she did not tell the whole truth, she described the way\r\nin which you had run after the carriage, till as she said you were\r\nblack in the face, and insisted on giving her all your pocket money,\r\nyour knife and your watch. She added that my coachman John\xe2\x80\x94whom I shall\r\ninstantly discharge\xe2\x80\x94was witness to the whole transaction. Now, Ernest,\r\nbe pleased to tell me whether this appalling story is true or false?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt never occurred to Ernest to ask his father why he did not hit a man\r\nhis own size, or to stop him midway in the story with a remonstrance\r\nagainst being kicked when he was down. The boy was too much shocked and\r\nshaken to be inventive; he could only drift and stammer out that the\r\ntale was true.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I feared,\xe2\x80\x9d said Theobald, \xe2\x80\x9cand now, Ernest, be good enough to ring\r\nthe bell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the bell had been answered, Theobald desired that John should be\r\nsent for, and when John came Theobald calculated the wages due to him\r\nand desired him at once to leave the house.\r\n\r\nJohn\xe2\x80\x99s manner was quiet and respectful. He took his dismissal as a\r\nmatter of course, for Theobald had hinted enough to make him understand\r\nwhy he was being discharged, but when he saw Ernest sitting pale and\r\nawe-struck on the edge of his chair against the dining-room wall, a\r\nsudden thought seemed to strike him, and turning to Theobald he said in\r\na broad northern accent which I will not attempt to reproduce:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, master, I can guess what all this is about\xe2\x80\x94now before I\r\ngoes I want to have a word with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cErnest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Theobald, \xe2\x80\x9cleave the room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Master Ernest, you shan\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said John, planting himself against\r\nthe door. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, master,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may do as you please about\r\nme. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a good servant to you, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say as you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen a bad master to me, but I do say that if you bear hardly on Master\r\nErnest here I have those in the village as \xe2\x80\x99ll hear on\xe2\x80\x99t and let me\r\nknow; and if I do hear on\xe2\x80\x99t I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back and break every bone in your\r\nskin, so there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn\xe2\x80\x99s breath came and went quickly, as though he would have been well\r\nenough pleased to begin the bone-breaking business at once. Theobald\r\nturned of an ashen colour\xe2\x80\x94not, as he explained afterwards, at the idle\r\nthreats of a detected and angry ruffian, but at such atrocious\r\ninsolence from one of his own servants.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall leave Master Ernest, John,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined proudly, \xe2\x80\x9cto the\r\nreproaches of his own conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cThank God and thank John,\xe2\x80\x9d thought\r\nErnest.) \xe2\x80\x9cAs for yourself, I admit that you have been an excellent\r\nservant until this unfortunate business came on, and I shall have much\r\npleasure in giving you a character if you want one. Have you anything\r\nmore to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more nor what I have said,\xe2\x80\x9d said John sullenly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said\r\nI means and I\xe2\x80\x99ll stick to\xe2\x80\x94character or no character.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you need not be afraid about your character, John,\xe2\x80\x9d said Theobald\r\nkindly, \xe2\x80\x9cand as it is getting late, there can be no occasion for you to\r\nleave the house before to-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this there was no reply from John, who retired, packed up his\r\nthings, and left the house at once.\r\n\r\nWhen Christina heard what had happened she said she could condone all\r\nexcept that Theobald should have been subjected to such insolence from\r\none of his own servants through the misconduct of his son. Theobald was\r\nthe bravest man in the whole world, and could easily have collared the\r\nwretch and turned him out of the room, but how far more dignified, how\r\nfar nobler had been his reply! How it would tell in a novel or upon the\r\nstage, for though the stage as a whole was immoral, yet there were\r\ndoubtless some plays which were improving spectacles. She could fancy\r\nthe whole house hushed with excitement at hearing John\xe2\x80\x99s menace, and\r\nhardly breathing by reason of their interest and expectation of the\r\ncoming answer. Then the actor\xe2\x80\x94probably the great and good Mr\r\nMacready\xe2\x80\x94would say, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall leave Master Ernest, John, to the\r\nreproaches of his own conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d Oh, it was sublime! What a roar of\r\napplause must follow! Then she should enter herself, and fling her arms\r\nabout her husband\xe2\x80\x99s neck, and call him her lion-hearted husband. When\r\nthe curtain dropped, it would be buzzed about the house that the scene\r\njust witnessed had been drawn from real life, and had actually occurred\r\nin the household of the Rev. Theobald Pontifex, who had married a Miss\r\nAllaby, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nAs regards Ernest the suspicions which had already crossed her mind\r\nwere deepened, but she thought it better to leave the matter where it\r\nwas. At present she was in a very strong position. Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s official\r\npurity was firmly established, but at the same time he had shown\r\nhimself so susceptible that she was able to fuse two contradictory\r\nimpressions concerning him into a single idea, and consider him as a\r\nkind of Joseph and Don Juan in one. This was what she had wanted all\r\nalong, but her vanity being gratified by the possession of such a son,\r\nthere was an end of it; the son himself was naught.\r\n\r\nNo doubt if John had not interfered, Ernest would have had to expiate\r\nhis offence with ache, penury and imprisonment. As it was the boy was\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cto consider himself\xe2\x80\x9d as undergoing these punishments, and as suffering\r\npangs of unavailing remorse inflicted on him by his conscience into the\r\nbargain; but beyond the fact that Theobald kept him more closely to his\r\nholiday task, and the continued coldness of his parents, no ostensible\r\npunishment was meted out to him. Ernest, however, tells me that he\r\nlooks back upon this as the time when he began to know that he had a\r\ncordial and active dislike for both his parents, which I suppose means\r\nthat he was now beginning to be aware that he was reaching man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nestate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout a week before he went back to school his father again sent for\r\nhim into the dining-room, and told him that he should restore him his\r\nwatch, but that he should deduct the sum he had paid for it\xe2\x80\x94for he had\r\nthought it better to pay a few shillings rather than dispute the\r\nownership of the watch, seeing that Ernest had undoubtedly given it to\r\nEllen\xe2\x80\x94from his pocket money, in payments which should extend over two\r\nhalf years. He would therefore have to go back to Roughborough this\r\nhalf year with only five shillings\xe2\x80\x99 pocket money. If he wanted more he\r\nmust earn more merit money.\r\n\r\nErnest was not so careful about money as a pattern boy should be. He\r\ndid not say to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cNow I have got a sovereign which must last me\r\nfifteen weeks, therefore I may spend exactly one shilling and fourpence\r\nin each week\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and spend exactly one and fourpence in each week\r\naccordingly. He ran through his money at about the same rate as other\r\nboys did, being pretty well cleaned out a few days after he had got\r\nback to school. When he had no more money, he got a little into debt,\r\nand when as far in debt as he could see his way to repaying, he went\r\nwithout luxuries. Immediately he got any money he would pay his debts;\r\nif there was any over he would spend it; if there was not\xe2\x80\x94and there\r\nseldom was\xe2\x80\x94he would begin to go on tick again.\r\n\r\nHis finance was always based upon the supposition that he should go\r\nback to school with \xc2\xa31 in his pocket\xe2\x80\x94of which he owed say a matter of\r\nfifteen shillings. There would be five shillings for sundry school\r\nsubscriptions\xe2\x80\x94but when these were paid the weekly allowance of sixpence\r\ngiven to each boy in hall, his merit money (which this half he was\r\nresolved should come to a good sum) and renewed credit, would carry him\r\nthrough the half.\r\n\r\nThe sudden failure of 15/- was disastrous to my hero\xe2\x80\x99s scheme of\r\nfinance. His face betrayed his emotions so clearly that Theobald said\r\nhe was determined \xe2\x80\x9cto learn the truth at once, and _this time_ without\r\ndays and days of falsehood\xe2\x80\x9d before he reached it. The melancholy fact\r\nwas not long in coming out, namely, that the wretched Ernest added debt\r\nto the vices of idleness, falsehood and possibly\xe2\x80\x94for it was not\r\nimpossible\xe2\x80\x94immorality.\r\n\r\nHow had he come to get into debt? Did the other boys do so? Ernest\r\nreluctantly admitted that they did.\r\n\r\nWith what shops did they get into debt?\r\n\r\nThis was asking too much, Ernest said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Ernest, Ernest,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed his mother, who was in the room, \xe2\x80\x9cdo\r\nnot so soon a second time presume upon the forbearance of the\r\ntenderest-hearted father in the world. Give time for one stab to heal\r\nbefore you wound him with another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was all very fine, but what was Ernest to do? How could he get the\r\nschool shop-keepers into trouble by owning that they let some of the\r\nboys go on tick with them? There was Mrs Cross, a good old soul, who\r\nused to sell hot rolls and butter for breakfast, or eggs and toast, or\r\nit might be the quarter of a fowl with bread sauce and mashed potatoes\r\nfor which she would charge 6d. If she made a farthing out of the\r\nsixpence it was as much as she did. When the boys would come trooping\r\ninto her shop after \xe2\x80\x9cthe hounds\xe2\x80\x9d how often had not Ernest heard her say\r\nto her servant girls, \xe2\x80\x9cNow then, you wanches, git some cheers.\xe2\x80\x9d All the\r\nboys were fond of her, and was he, Ernest, to tell tales about her? It\r\nwas horrible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow look here, Ernest,\xe2\x80\x9d said his father with his blackest scowl, \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\ngoing to put a stop to this nonsense once for all. Either take me fully\r\ninto your confidence, as a son should take a father, and trust me to\r\ndeal with this matter as a clergyman and a man of the world\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nunderstand distinctly that I shall take the whole story to Dr Skinner,\r\nwho, I imagine, will take much sterner measures than I should.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Ernest, Ernest,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Christina, \xe2\x80\x9cbe wise in time, and trust\r\nthose who have already shown you that they know but too well how to be\r\nforbearing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo genuine hero of romance should have hesitated for a moment. Nothing\r\nshould have cajoled or frightened him into telling tales out of school.\r\nErnest thought of his ideal boys: they, he well knew, would have let\r\ntheir tongues be cut out of them before information could have been\r\nwrung from any word of theirs. But Ernest was not an ideal boy, and he\r\nwas not strong enough for his surroundings; I doubt how far any boy\r\ncould withstand the moral pressure which was brought to bear upon him;\r\nat any rate he could not do so, and after a little more writhing he\r\nyielded himself a passive prey to the enemy. He consoled himself with\r\nthe reflection that his papa had not played the confidence trick on him\r\nquite as often as his mamma had, and that probably it was better he\r\nshould tell his father, than that his father should insist on Dr\r\nSkinner\xe2\x80\x99s making an inquiry. His papa\xe2\x80\x99s conscience \xe2\x80\x9cjabbered\xe2\x80\x9d a good\r\ndeal, but not as much as his mamma\xe2\x80\x99s. The little fool forgot that he\r\nhad not given his father as many chances of betraying him as he had\r\ngiven to Christina.\r\n\r\nThen it all came out. He owed this at Mrs Cross\xe2\x80\x99s, and this to Mrs\r\nJones, and this at the \xe2\x80\x9cSwan and Bottle\xe2\x80\x9d public house, to say nothing\r\nof another shilling or sixpence or two in other quarters. Nevertheless,\r\nTheobald and Christina were not satiated, but rather the more they\r\ndiscovered the greater grew their appetite for discovery; it was their\r\nobvious duty to find out everything, for though they might rescue their\r\nown darling from this hotbed of iniquity without getting to know more\r\nthan they knew at present, were there not other papas and mammas with\r\ndarlings whom also they were bound to rescue if it were yet possible?\r\nWhat boys, then, owed money to these harpies as well as Ernest?\r\n\r\nHere, again, there was a feeble show of resistance, but the thumbscrews\r\nwere instantly applied, and Ernest, demoralised as he already was,\r\nrecanted and submitted himself to the powers that were. He told only a\r\nlittle less than he knew or thought he knew. He was examined,\r\nre-examined, cross-examined, sent to the retirement of his own bedroom\r\nand cross-examined again; the smoking in Mrs Jones\xe2\x80\x99 kitchen all came\r\nout; which boys smoked and which did not; which boys owed money and,\r\nroughly, how much and where; which boys swore and used bad language.\r\nTheobald was resolved that this time Ernest should, as he called it,\r\ntake him into his confidence without reserve, so the school list which\r\nwent with Dr Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s half-yearly bills was brought out, and the most\r\nsecret character of each boy was gone through _seriatim_ by Mr and Mrs\r\nPontifex, so far as it was in Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s power to give information\r\nconcerning it, and yet Theobald had on the preceding Sunday preached a\r\nless feeble sermon than he commonly preached, upon the horrors of the\r\nInquisition. No matter how awful was the depravity revealed to them,\r\nthe pair never flinched, but probed and probed, till they were on the\r\npoint of reaching subjects more delicate than they had yet touched\r\nupon. Here Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s unconscious self took the matter up and made a\r\nresistance to which his conscious self was unequal, by tumbling him off\r\nhis chair in a fit of fainting.\r\n\r\nDr Martin was sent for and pronounced the boy to be seriously unwell;\r\nat the same time he prescribed absolute rest and absence from nervous\r\nexcitement. So the anxious parents were unwillingly compelled to be\r\ncontent with what they had got already\xe2\x80\x94being frightened into leading\r\nhim a quiet life for the short remainder of the holidays. They were not\r\nidle, but Satan can find as much mischief for busy hands as for idle\r\nones, so he sent a little job in the direction of Battersby which\r\nTheobald and Christina undertook immediately. It would be a pity, they\r\nreasoned, that Ernest should leave Roughborough, now that he had been\r\nthere three years; it would be difficult to find another school for\r\nhim, and to explain why he had left Roughborough. Besides, Dr Skinner\r\nand Theobald were supposed to be old friends, and it would be\r\nunpleasant to offend him; these were all valid reasons for not removing\r\nthe boy. The proper thing to do, then, would be to warn Dr Skinner\r\nconfidentially of the state of his school, and to furnish him with a\r\nschool list annotated with the remarks extracted from Ernest, which\r\nshould be appended to the name of each boy.\r\n\r\nTheobald was the perfection of neatness; while his son was ill\r\nupstairs, he copied out the school list so that he could throw his\r\ncomments into a tabular form, which assumed the following shape\xe2\x80\x94only\r\nthat of course I have changed the names. One cross in each square was\r\nto indicate occasional offence; two stood for frequent, and three for\r\nhabitual delinquency.\r\n\r\n          Smoking     Drinking beer    Swearing      Notes at the \xe2\x80\x9cSwan\r\n              and Obscene and Bottle.\xe2\x80\x9d     Language. Smith        O    \r\n                 O              XX          Will smoke next half Brown \r\n               XXX           O               X Jones        X          \r\n           XX              XXX Robinson    XX            XX            \r\n           X\r\n\r\nAnd thus through the whole school.\r\n\r\nOf course, in justice to Ernest, Dr Skinner would be bound over to\r\nsecrecy before a word was said to him, but, Ernest being thus\r\nprotected, he could not be furnished with the facts too completely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\n\r\nSo important did Theobald consider this matter that he made a special\r\njourney to Roughborough before the half year began. It was a relief to\r\nhave him out of the house, but though his destination was not\r\nmentioned, Ernest guessed where he had gone.\r\n\r\nTo this day he considers his conduct at this crisis to have been one of\r\nthe most serious laches of his life\xe2\x80\x94one which he can never think of\r\nwithout shame and indignation. He says he ought to have run away from\r\nhome. But what good could he have done if he had? He would have been\r\ncaught, brought back and examined two days later instead of two days\r\nearlier. A boy of barely sixteen cannot stand against the moral\r\npressure of a father and mother who have always oppressed him any more\r\nthan he can cope physically with a powerful full-grown man. True, he\r\nmay allow himself to be killed rather than yield, but this is being so\r\nmorbidly heroic as to come close round again to cowardice; for it is\r\nlittle else than suicide, which is universally condemned as cowardly.\r\n\r\nOn the re-assembling of the school it became apparent that something\r\nhad gone wrong. Dr Skinner called the boys together, and with much pomp\r\nexcommunicated Mrs Cross and Mrs Jones, by declaring their shops to be\r\nout of bounds. The street in which the \xe2\x80\x9cSwan and Bottle\xe2\x80\x9d stood was also\r\nforbidden. The vices of drinking and smoking, therefore, were clearly\r\naimed at, and before prayers Dr Skinner spoke a few impressive words\r\nabout the abominable sin of using bad language. Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s feelings can\r\nbe imagined.\r\n\r\nNext day at the hour when the daily punishments were read out, though\r\nthere had not yet been time for him to have offended, Ernest Pontifex\r\nwas declared to have incurred every punishment which the school\r\nprovided for evil-doers. He was placed on the idle list for the whole\r\nhalf year, and on perpetual detentions; his bounds were curtailed; he\r\nwas to attend junior callings-over; in fact he was so hemmed in with\r\npunishments upon every side that it was hardly possible for him to go\r\noutside the school gates. This unparalleled list of punishments\r\ninflicted on the first day of the half year, and intended to last till\r\nthe ensuing Christmas holidays, was not connected with any specified\r\noffence. It required no great penetration therefore, on the part of the\r\nboys to connect Ernest with the putting Mrs Cross\xe2\x80\x99s and Mrs Jones\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshops out of bounds.\r\n\r\nGreat indeed was the indignation about Mrs Cross who, it was known,\r\nremembered Dr Skinner himself as a small boy only just got into\r\njackets, and had doubtless let him have many a sausage and mashed\r\npotatoes upon deferred payment. The head boys assembled in conclave to\r\nconsider what steps should be taken, but hardly had they done so before\r\nErnest knocked timidly at the head-room door and took the bull by the\r\nhorns by explaining the facts as far as he could bring himself to do\r\nso. He made a clean breast of everything except about the school list\r\nand the remarks he had made about each boy\xe2\x80\x99s character. This infamy was\r\nmore than he could own to, and he kept his counsel concerning it.\r\nFortunately he was safe in doing so, for Dr Skinner, pedant and more\r\nthan pedant though he was, had still just sense enough to turn on\r\nTheobald in the matter of the school list. Whether he resented being\r\ntold that he did not know the characters of his own boys, or whether he\r\ndreaded a scandal about the school I know not, but when Theobald had\r\nhanded him the list, over which he had expended so much pains, Dr\r\nSkinner had cut him uncommonly short, and had then and there, with more\r\nsuavity than was usual with him, committed it to the flames before\r\nTheobald\xe2\x80\x99s own eyes.\r\n\r\nErnest got off with the head boys easier than he expected. It was\r\nadmitted that the offence, heinous though it was, had been committed\r\nunder extenuating circumstances; the frankness with which the culprit\r\nhad confessed all, his evidently unfeigned remorse, and the fury with\r\nwhich Dr Skinner was pursuing him tended to bring about a reaction in\r\nhis favour, as though he had been more sinned against than sinning.\r\n\r\nAs the half year wore on his spirits gradually revived, and when\r\nattacked by one of his fits of self-abasement he was in some degree\r\nconsoled by having found out that even his father and mother, whom he\r\nhad supposed so immaculate, were no better than they should be. About\r\nthe fifth of November it was a school custom to meet on a certain\r\ncommon not far from Roughborough and burn somebody in effigy, this\r\nbeing the compromise arrived at in the matter of fireworks and Guy\r\nFawkes festivities. This year it was decided that Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s governor\r\nshould be the victim, and Ernest though a good deal exercised in mind\r\nas to what he ought to do, in the end saw no sufficient reason for\r\nholding aloof from proceedings which, as he justly remarked, could not\r\ndo his father any harm.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that the bishop had held a confirmation at the school on\r\nthe fifth of November. Dr Skinner had not quite liked the selection of\r\nthis day, but the bishop was pressed by many engagements, and had been\r\ncompelled to make the arrangement as it then stood. Ernest was among\r\nthose who had to be confirmed, and was deeply impressed with the solemn\r\nimportance of the ceremony. When he felt the huge old bishop drawing\r\ndown upon him as he knelt in chapel he could hardly breathe, and when\r\nthe apparition paused before him and laid its hands upon his head he\r\nwas frightened almost out of his wits. He felt that he had arrived at\r\none of the great turning points of his life, and that the Ernest of the\r\nfuture could resemble only very faintly the Ernest of the past.\r\n\r\nThis happened at about noon, but by the one o\xe2\x80\x99clock dinner-hour the\r\neffect of the confirmation had worn off, and he saw no reason why he\r\nshould forego his annual amusement with the bonfire; so he went with\r\nthe others and was very valiant till the image was actually produced\r\nand was about to be burnt; then he felt a little frightened. It was a\r\npoor thing enough, made of paper, calico and straw, but they had\r\nchristened it The Rev. Theobald Pontifex, and he had a revulsion of\r\nfeeling as he saw it being carried towards the bonfire. Still he held\r\nhis ground, and in a few minutes when all was over felt none the worse\r\nfor having assisted at a ceremony which, after all, was prompted by a\r\nboyish love of mischief rather than by rancour.\r\n\r\nI should say that Ernest had written to his father, and told him of the\r\nunprecedented way in which he was being treated; he even ventured to\r\nsuggest that Theobald should interfere for his protection and reminded\r\nhim how the story had been got out of him, but Theobald had had enough\r\nof Dr Skinner for the present; the burning of the school list had been\r\na rebuff which did not encourage him to meddle a second time in the\r\ninternal economics of Roughborough. He therefore replied that he must\r\neither remove Ernest from Roughborough altogether, which would for many\r\nreasons be undesirable, or trust to the discretion of the head master\r\nas regards the treatment he might think best for any of his pupils.\r\nErnest said no more; he still felt that it was so discreditable to him\r\nto have allowed any confession to be wrung from him, that he could not\r\npress the promised amnesty for himself.\r\n\r\nIt was during the \xe2\x80\x9cMother Cross row,\xe2\x80\x9d as it was long styled among the\r\nboys, that a remarkable phenomenon was witnessed at Roughborough. I\r\nmean that of the head boys under certain conditions doing errands for\r\ntheir juniors. The head boys had no bounds and could go to Mrs Cross\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhenever they liked; they actually, therefore, made themselves\r\ngo-betweens, and would get anything from either Mrs Cross\xe2\x80\x99s or Mrs\r\nJones\xe2\x80\x99s for any boy, no matter how low in the school, between the hours\r\nof a quarter to nine and nine in the morning, and a quarter to six and\r\nsix in the afternoon. By degrees, however, the boys grew bolder, and\r\nthe shops, though not openly declared in bounds again, were tacitly\r\nallowed to be so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\n\r\nI may spare the reader more details about my hero\xe2\x80\x99s school days. He\r\nrose, always in spite of himself, into the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s form, and for the\r\nlast two years or so of his time was among the pr\xc3\xa6postors, though he\r\nnever rose into the upper half of them. He did little, and I think the\r\nDoctor rather gave him up as a boy whom he had better leave to himself,\r\nfor he rarely made him construe, and he used to send in his exercises\r\nor not, pretty much as he liked. His tacit, unconscious obstinacy had\r\nin time effected more even than a few bold sallies in the first\r\ninstance would have done. To the end of his career his position _inter\r\npares_ was what it had been at the beginning, namely, among the upper\r\npart of the less reputable class\xe2\x80\x94whether of seniors or juniors\xe2\x80\x94rather\r\nthan among the lower part of the more respectable.\r\n\r\nOnly once in the whole course of his school life did he get praise from\r\nDr Skinner for any exercise, and this he has treasured as the best\r\nexample of guarded approval which he has ever seen. He had had to write\r\na copy of Alcaics on \xe2\x80\x9cThe dogs of the monks of St Bernard,\xe2\x80\x9d and when\r\nthe exercise was returned to him he found the Doctor had written on it:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this copy of Alcaics\xe2\x80\x94which is still excessively bad\xe2\x80\x94I fancy that I\r\ncan discern some faint symptoms of improvement.\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest says that if\r\nthe exercise was any better than usual it must have been by a fluke,\r\nfor he is sure that he always liked dogs, especially St Bernard dogs,\r\nfar too much to take any pleasure in writing Alcaics about them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I look back upon it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to me but the other day, with a\r\nhearty laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cI respect myself more for having never once got the best\r\nmark for an exercise than I should do if I had got it every time it\r\ncould be got. I am glad nothing could make me do Latin and Greek\r\nverses; I am glad Skinner could never get any moral influence over me;\r\nI am glad I was idle at school, and I am glad my father overtasked me\r\nas a boy\xe2\x80\x94otherwise, likely enough I should have acquiesced in the\r\nswindle, and might have written as good a copy of Alcaics about the\r\ndogs of the monks of St Bernard as my neighbours, and yet I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\r\nfor I remember there was another boy, who sent in a Latin copy of some\r\nsort, but for his own pleasure he wrote the following\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThe dogs of the monks of St Bernard go\r\nTo pick little children out of the snow,\r\nAnd around their necks is the cordial gin\r\nTied with a little bit of bob-bin.\r\n\r\nI should like to have written that, and I did try, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t quite like the last line, and tried to mend it, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI fancied I could see traces of bitterness against the instructors of\r\nhis youth in Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s manner, and said something to this effect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, still laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cno more than St Anthony felt\r\ntowards the devils who had tempted him, when he met some of them\r\ncasually a hundred or a couple of hundred years afterwards. Of course\r\nhe knew they were devils, but that was all right enough; there must be\r\ndevils. St Anthony probably liked these devils better than most others,\r\nand for old acquaintance sake showed them as much indulgence as was\r\ncompatible with decorum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cSt Anthony tempted the devils quite as\r\nmuch as they tempted him; for his peculiar sanctity was a greater\r\ntemptation to tempt him than they could stand. Strictly speaking, it\r\nwas the devils who were the more to be pitied, for they were led up by\r\nSt Anthony to be tempted and fell, whereas St Anthony did not fall. I\r\nbelieve I was a disagreeable and unintelligible boy, and if ever I meet\r\nSkinner there is no one whom I would shake hands with, or do a good\r\nturn to more readily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt home things went on rather better; the Ellen and Mother Cross rows\r\nsank slowly down upon the horizon, and even at home he had quieter\r\ntimes now that he had become a pr\xc3\xa6postor. Nevertheless the watchful eye\r\nand protecting hand were still ever over him to guard his comings in\r\nand his goings out, and to spy out all his ways. Is it wonderful that\r\nthe boy, though always trying to keep up appearances as though he were\r\ncheerful and contented\xe2\x80\x94and at times actually being so\xe2\x80\x94wore often an\r\nanxious, jaded look when he thought none were looking, which told of an\r\nalmost incessant conflict within?\r\n\r\nDoubtless Theobald saw these looks and knew how to interpret them, but\r\nit was his profession to know how to shut his eyes to things that were\r\ninconvenient\xe2\x80\x94no clergyman could keep his benefice for a month if he\r\ncould not do this; besides he had allowed himself for so many years to\r\nsay things he ought not to have said, and not to say the things he\r\nought to have said, that he was little likely to see anything that he\r\nthought it more convenient not to see unless he was made to do so.\r\n\r\nIt was not much that was wanted. To make no mysteries where Nature has\r\nmade none, to bring his conscience under something like reasonable\r\ncontrol, to give Ernest his head a little more, to ask fewer questions,\r\nand to give him pocket money with a desire that it should be spent upon\r\n_menus plaisirs_ . . .\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall that not much indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Ernest, as I read him what I have\r\njust written. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy it is the whole duty of a father, but it is the\r\nmystery-making which is the worst evil. If people would dare to speak\r\nto one another unreservedly, there would be a good deal less sorrow in\r\nthe world a hundred years hence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to Roughborough. On the day of his leaving, when he\r\nwas sent for into the library to be shaken hands with, he was surprised\r\nto feel that, though assuredly glad to leave, he did not do so with any\r\nespecial grudge against the Doctor rankling in his breast. He had come\r\nto the end of it all, and was still alive, nor, take it all round, more\r\nseriously amiss than other people. Dr Skinner received him graciously,\r\nand was even frolicsome after his own heavy fashion. Young people are\r\nalmost always placable, and Ernest felt as he went away that another\r\nsuch interview would not only have wiped off all old scores, but have\r\nbrought him round into the ranks of the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s admirers and\r\nsupporters\xe2\x80\x94among whom it is only fair to say that the greater number of\r\nthe more promising boys were found.\r\n\r\nJust before saying good-bye the Doctor actually took down a volume from\r\nthose shelves which had seemed so awful six years previously, and gave\r\nit to him after having written his name in it, and the words \xcf\x86\xce\xb9\xce\xbb\xce\xb9\xce\xb1\xcf\x82 \xce\xba\xce\xb1\xce\xb9\r\n\xce\xb5\xcf\x85\xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xce\xb9\xce\xb1\xcf\x82 \xcf\x87\xce\xb1\xcf\x81\xce\xb9\xce\xbd, which I believe means \xe2\x80\x9cwith all kind wishes from the\r\ndonor.\xe2\x80\x9d The book was one written in Latin by a German\xe2\x80\x94Sch\xc3\xb6mann: \xe2\x80\x9cDe\r\ncomitiis Atheniensibus\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94not exactly light and cheerful reading, but\r\nErnest felt it was high time he got to understand the Athenian\r\nconstitution and manner of voting; he had got them up a great many\r\ntimes already, but had forgotten them as fast as he had learned them;\r\nnow, however, that the Doctor had given him this book, he would master\r\nthe subject once for all. How strange it was! He wanted to remember\r\nthese things very badly; he knew he did, but he could never retain\r\nthem; in spite of himself they no sooner fell upon his mind than they\r\nfell off it again, he had such a dreadful memory; whereas, if anyone\r\nplayed him a piece of music and told him where it came from, he never\r\nforgot that, though he made no effort to retain it, and was not even\r\nconscious of trying to remember it at all. His mind must be badly\r\nformed and he was no good.\r\n\r\nHaving still a short time to spare, he got the keys of St Michael\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchurch and went to have a farewell practice upon the organ, which he\r\ncould now play fairly well. He walked up and down the aisle for a while\r\nin a meditative mood, and then, settling down to the organ, played\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey loathed to drink of the river\xe2\x80\x9d about six times over, after which\r\nhe felt more composed and happier; then, tearing himself away from the\r\ninstrument he loved so well, he hurried to the station.\r\n\r\nAs the train drew out he looked down from a high embankment on to the\r\nlittle house his aunt had taken, and where it might be said she had\r\ndied through her desire to do him a kindness. There were the two\r\nwell-known bow windows, out of which he had often stepped to run across\r\nthe lawn into the workshop. He reproached himself with the little\r\ngratitude he had shown towards this kind lady\xe2\x80\x94the only one of his\r\nrelations whom he had ever felt as though he could have taken into his\r\nconfidence. Dearly as he loved her memory, he was glad she had not\r\nknown the scrapes he had got into since she died; perhaps she might not\r\nhave forgiven them\xe2\x80\x94and how awful that would have been! But then, if she\r\nhad lived, perhaps many of his ills would have been spared him. As he\r\nmused thus he grew sad again. Where, where, he asked himself, was it\r\nall to end? Was it to be always sin, shame and sorrow in the future, as\r\nit had been in the past, and the ever-watchful eye and protecting hand\r\nof his father laying burdens on him greater than he could bear\xe2\x80\x94or was\r\nhe, too, some day or another to come to feel that he was fairly well\r\nand happy?\r\n\r\nThere was a gray mist across the sun, so that the eye could bear its\r\nlight, and Ernest, while musing as above, was looking right into the\r\nmiddle of the sun himself, as into the face of one whom he knew and was\r\nfond of. At first his face was grave, but kindly, as of a tired man who\r\nfeels that a long task is over; but in a few seconds the more humorous\r\nside of his misfortunes presented itself to him, and he smiled half\r\nreproachfully, half merrily, as thinking how little all that had\r\nhappened to him really mattered, and how small were his hardships as\r\ncompared with those of most people. Still looking into the eye of the\r\nsun and smiling dreamily, he thought how he had helped to burn his\r\nfather in effigy, and his look grew merrier, till at last he broke out\r\ninto a laugh. Exactly at this moment the light veil of cloud parted\r\nfrom the sun, and he was brought to _terra firma_ by the breaking forth\r\nof the sunshine. On this he became aware that he was being watched\r\nattentively by a fellow-traveller opposite to him, an elderly gentleman\r\nwith a large head and iron-grey hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy young friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, good-naturedly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou really must not carry\r\non conversations with people in the sun, while you are in a public\r\nrailway carriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman said not another word, but unfolded his _Times_ and\r\nbegan to read it. As for Ernest, he blushed crimson. The pair did not\r\nspeak during the rest of the time they were in the carriage, but they\r\neyed each other from time to time, so that the face of each was\r\nimpressed on the recollection of the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\n\r\nSome people say that their school days were the happiest of their\r\nlives. They may be right, but I always look with suspicion upon those\r\nwhom I hear saying this. It is hard enough to know whether one is happy\r\nor unhappy now, and still harder to compare the relative happiness or\r\nunhappiness of different times of one\xe2\x80\x99s life; the utmost that can be\r\nsaid is that we are fairly happy so long as we are not distinctly aware\r\nof being miserable. As I was talking with Ernest one day not so long\r\nsince about this, he said he was so happy now that he was sure he had\r\nnever been happier, and did not wish to be so, but that Cambridge was\r\nthe first place where he had ever been consciously and continuously\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\nHow can any boy fail to feel an ecstasy of pleasure on first finding\r\nhimself in rooms which he knows for the next few years are to be his\r\ncastle? Here he will not be compelled to turn out of the most\r\ncomfortable place as soon as he has ensconced himself in it because\r\npapa or mamma happens to come into the room, and he should give it up\r\nto them. The most cosy chair here is for himself, there is no one even\r\nto share the room with him, or to interfere with his doing as he likes\r\nin it\xe2\x80\x94smoking included. Why, if such a room looked out both back and\r\nfront on to a blank dead wall it would still be a paradise, how much\r\nmore then when the view is of some quiet grassy court or cloister or\r\ngarden, as from the windows of the greater number of rooms at Oxford\r\nand Cambridge.\r\n\r\nTheobald, as an old fellow and tutor of Emmanuel\xe2\x80\x94at which college he\r\nhad entered Ernest\xe2\x80\x94was able to obtain from the present tutor a certain\r\npreference in the choice of rooms; Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s, therefore, were very\r\npleasant ones, looking out upon the grassy court that is bounded by the\r\nFellows\xe2\x80\x99 gardens.\r\n\r\nTheobald accompanied him to Cambridge, and was at his best while doing\r\nso. He liked the jaunt, and even he was not without a certain feeling\r\nof pride in having a full-blown son at the University. Some of the\r\nreflected rays of this splendour were allowed to fall upon Ernest\r\nhimself. Theobald said he was \xe2\x80\x9cwilling to hope\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94this was one of his\r\ntags\xe2\x80\x94that his son would turn over a new leaf now that he had left\r\nschool, and for his own part he was \xe2\x80\x9conly too ready\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94this was another\r\ntag\xe2\x80\x94to let bygones be bygones.\r\n\r\nErnest, not yet having his name on the books, was able to dine with his\r\nfather at the Fellows\xe2\x80\x99 table of one of the other colleges on the\r\ninvitation of an old friend of Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s; he there made acquaintance\r\nwith sundry of the good things of this life, the very names of which\r\nwere new to him, and felt as he ate them that he was now indeed\r\nreceiving a liberal education. When at length the time came for him to\r\ngo to Emmanuel, where he was to sleep in his new rooms, his father came\r\nwith him to the gates and saw him safe into college; a few minutes more\r\nand he found himself alone in a room for which he had a latch-key.\r\n\r\nFrom this time he dated many days which, if not quite unclouded, were\r\nupon the whole very happy ones. I need not however describe them, as\r\nthe life of a quiet steady-going undergraduate has been told in a score\r\nof novels better than I can tell it. Some of Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s schoolfellows\r\ncame up to Cambridge at the same time as himself, and with these he\r\ncontinued on friendly terms during the whole of his college career.\r\nOther schoolfellows were only a year or two his seniors; these called\r\non him, and he thus made a sufficiently favourable _entr\xc3\xa9e_ into\r\ncollege life. A straightforwardness of character that was stamped upon\r\nhis face, a love of humour, and a temper which was more easily appeased\r\nthan ruffled made up for some awkwardness and want of _savoir faire_.\r\nHe soon became a not unpopular member of the best set of his year, and\r\nthough neither capable of becoming, nor aspiring to become, a leader,\r\nwas admitted by the leaders as among their nearer hangers-on.\r\n\r\nOf ambition he had at that time not one particle; greatness, or indeed\r\nsuperiority of any kind, seemed so far off and incomprehensible to him\r\nthat the idea of connecting it with himself never crossed his mind. If\r\nhe could escape the notice of all those with whom he did not feel\r\nhimself _en rapport_, he conceived that he had triumphed sufficiently.\r\nHe did not care about taking a good degree, except that it must be good\r\nenough to keep his father and mother quiet. He did not dream of being\r\nable to get a fellowship; if he had, he would have tried hard to do so,\r\nfor he became so fond of Cambridge that he could not bear the thought\r\nof having to leave it; the briefness indeed of the season during which\r\nhis present happiness was to last was almost the only thing that now\r\nseriously troubled him.\r\n\r\nHaving less to attend to in the matter of growing, and having got his\r\nhead more free, he took to reading fairly well\xe2\x80\x94not because he liked it,\r\nbut because he was told he ought to do so, and his natural instinct,\r\nlike that of all very young men who are good for anything, was to do as\r\nthose in authority told him. The intention at Battersby was (for Dr\r\nSkinner had said that Ernest could never get a fellowship) that he\r\nshould take a sufficiently good degree to be able to get a tutorship or\r\nmastership in some school preparatory to taking orders. When he was\r\ntwenty-one years old his money was to come into his own hands, and the\r\nbest thing he could do with it would be to buy the next presentation to\r\na living, the rector of which was now old, and live on his mastership\r\nor tutorship till the living fell in. He could buy a very good living\r\nfor the sum which his grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s legacy now amounted to, for\r\nTheobald had never had any serious intention of making deductions for\r\nhis son\xe2\x80\x99s maintenance and education, and the money had accumulated till\r\nit was now about five thousand pounds; he had only talked about making\r\ndeductions in order to stimulate the boy to exertion as far as\r\npossible, by making him think that this was his only chance of escaping\r\nstarvation\xe2\x80\x94or perhaps from pure love of teasing.\r\n\r\nWhen Ernest had a living of \xc2\xa3600 or \xc2\xa3700 a year with a house, and not\r\ntoo many parishioners\xe2\x80\x94why, he might add to his income by taking pupils,\r\nor even keeping a school, and then, say at thirty, he might marry. It\r\nwas not easy for Theobald to hit on any much more sensible plan. He\r\ncould not get Ernest into business, for he had no business\r\nconnections\xe2\x80\x94besides he did not know what business meant; he had no\r\ninterest, again, at the Bar; medicine was a profession which subjected\r\nits students to ordeals and temptations which these fond parents shrank\r\nfrom on behalf of their boy; he would be thrown among companions and\r\nfamiliarised with details which might sully him, and though he might\r\nstand, it was \xe2\x80\x9conly too possible\xe2\x80\x9d that he would fall. Besides,\r\nordination was the road which Theobald knew and understood, and indeed\r\nthe only road about which he knew anything at all, so not unnaturally\r\nit was the one he chose for Ernest.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing had been instilled into my hero from earliest boyhood,\r\nmuch as it had been instilled into Theobald himself, and with the same\r\nresult\xe2\x80\x94the conviction, namely, that he was certainly to be a clergyman,\r\nbut that it was a long way off yet, and he supposed it was all right.\r\nAs for the duty of reading hard, and taking as good a degree as he\r\ncould, this was plain enough, so he set himself to work, as I have\r\nsaid, steadily, and to the surprise of everyone as well as himself got\r\na college scholarship, of no great value, but still a scholarship, in\r\nhis freshman\xe2\x80\x99s term. It is hardly necessary to say that Theobald stuck\r\nto the whole of this money, believing the pocket-money he allowed\r\nErnest to be sufficient for him, and knowing how dangerous it was for\r\nyoung men to have money at command. I do not suppose it even occurred\r\nto him to try and remember what he had felt when his father took a like\r\ncourse in regard to himself.\r\n\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x99s position in this respect was much what it had been at school\r\nexcept that things were on a larger scale. His tutor\xe2\x80\x99s and cook\xe2\x80\x99s bills\r\nwere paid for him; his father sent him his wine; over and above this he\r\nhad \xc2\xa350 a year with which to keep himself in clothes and all other\r\nexpenses; this was about the usual thing at Emmanuel in Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s day,\r\nthough many had much less than this. Ernest did as he had done at\r\nschool\xe2\x80\x94he spent what he could, soon after he received his money; he\r\nthen incurred a few modest liabilities, and then lived penuriously till\r\nnext term, when he would immediately pay his debts, and start new ones\r\nto much the same extent as those which he had just got rid of. When he\r\ncame into his \xc2\xa35000 and became independent of his father, \xc2\xa315 or \xc2\xa320\r\nserved to cover the whole of his unauthorised expenditure.\r\n\r\nHe joined the boat club, and was constant in his attendance at the\r\nboats. He still smoked, but never took more wine or beer than was good\r\nfor him, except perhaps on the occasion of a boating supper, but even\r\nthen he found the consequences unpleasant, and soon learned how to keep\r\nwithin safe limits. He attended chapel as often as he was compelled to\r\ndo so; he communicated two or three times a year, because his tutor\r\ntold him he ought to; in fact he set himself to live soberly and\r\ncleanly, as I imagine all his instincts prompted him to do, and when he\r\nfell\xe2\x80\x94as who that is born of woman can help sometimes doing?\xe2\x80\x94it was not\r\ntill after a sharp tussle with a temptation that was more than his\r\nflesh and blood could stand; then he was very penitent and would go a\r\nfairly long while without sinning again; and this was how it had always\r\nbeen with him since he had arrived at years of indiscretion.\r\n\r\nEven to the end of his career at Cambridge he was not aware that he had\r\nit in him to do anything, but others had begun to see that he was not\r\nwanting in ability and sometimes told him so. He did not believe it;\r\nindeed he knew very well that if they thought him clever they were\r\nbeing taken in, but it pleased him to have been able to take them in,\r\nand he tried to do so still further; he was therefore a good deal on\r\nthe look-out for cants that he could catch and apply in season, and\r\nmight have done himself some mischief thus if he had not been ready to\r\nthrow over any cant as soon as he had come across another more nearly\r\nto his fancy; his friends used to say that when he rose he flew like a\r\nsnipe, darting several times in various directions before he settled\r\ndown to a steady straight flight, but when he had once got into this he\r\nwould keep to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he was in his third year a magazine was founded at Cambridge, the\r\ncontributions to which were exclusively by undergraduates. Ernest sent\r\nin an essay upon the Greek Drama, which he has declined to let me\r\nreproduce here without his being allowed to re-edit it. I have\r\ntherefore been unable to give it in its original form, but when pruned\r\nof its redundancies (and this is all that has been done to it) it runs\r\nas follows\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not attempt within the limits at my disposal to make a\r\n_r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9_ of the rise and progress of the Greek drama, but will confine\r\nmyself to considering whether the reputation enjoyed by the three chief\r\nGreek tragedians, \xc3\x86schylus, Sophocles and Euripides, is one that will\r\nbe permanent, or whether they will one day be held to have been\r\noverrated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I ask myself, do I see much that I can easily admire in Homer,\r\nThucydides, Herodotus, Demosthenes, Aristophanes, Theocritus, parts of\r\nLucretius, Horace\xe2\x80\x99s satires and epistles, to say nothing of other\r\nancient writers, and yet find myself at once repelled by even those\r\nworks of \xc3\x86schylus, Sophocles and Euripides which are most generally\r\nadmired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith the first-named writers I am in the hands of men who feel, if not\r\nas I do, still as I can understand their feeling, and as I am\r\ninterested to see that they should have felt; with the second I have so\r\nlittle sympathy that I cannot understand how anyone can ever have taken\r\nany interest in them whatever. Their highest flights to me are dull,\r\npompous and artificial productions, which, if they were to appear now\r\nfor the first time, would, I should think, either fall dead or be\r\nseverely handled by the critics. I wish to know whether it is I who am\r\nin fault in this matter, or whether part of the blame may not rest with\r\nthe tragedians themselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow far I wonder did the Athenians genuinely like these poets, and how\r\nfar was the applause which was lavished upon them due to fashion or\r\naffectation? How far, in fact, did admiration for the orthodox\r\ntragedians take that place among the Athenians which going to church\r\ndoes among ourselves?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a venturesome question considering the verdict now generally\r\ngiven for over two thousand years, nor should I have permitted myself\r\nto ask it if it had not been suggested to me by one whose reputation\r\nstands as high, and has been sanctioned for as long time as those of\r\nthe tragedians themselves, I mean by Aristophanes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNumbers, weight of authority, and time, have conspired to place\r\nAristophanes on as high a literary pinnacle as any ancient writer, with\r\nthe exception perhaps of Homer, but he makes no secret of heartily\r\nhating Euripides and Sophocles, and I strongly suspect only praises\r\n\xc3\x86schylus that he may run down the other two with greater impunity. For\r\nafter all there is no such difference between \xc3\x86schylus and his\r\nsuccessors as will render the former very good and the latter very bad;\r\nand the thrusts at \xc3\x86schylus which Aristophanes puts into the mouth of\r\nEuripides go home too well to have been written by an admirer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be observed that while Euripides accuses \xc3\x86schylus of being\r\n\xe2\x80\x98pomp-bundle-worded,\xe2\x80\x99 which I suppose means bombastic and given to\r\nrodomontade, \xc3\x86schylus retorts on Euripides that he is a \xe2\x80\x98gossip\r\ngleaner, a describer of beggars, and a rag-stitcher,\xe2\x80\x99 from which it may\r\nbe inferred that he was truer to the life of his own times than\r\n\xc3\x86schylus was. It happens, however, that a faithful rendering of\r\ncontemporary life is the very quality which gives its most permanent\r\ninterest to any work of fiction, whether in literature or painting, and\r\nit is a not unnatural consequence that while only seven plays by\r\n\xc3\x86schylus, and the same number by Sophocles, have come down to us, we\r\nhave no fewer than nineteen by Euripides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis, however, is a digression; the question before us is whether\r\nAristophanes really liked \xc3\x86schylus or only pretended to do so. It must\r\nbe remembered that the claims of \xc3\x86schylus, Sophocles and Euripides, to\r\nthe foremost place amongst tragedians were held to be as\r\nincontrovertible as those of Dante, Petrarch, Tasso and Ariosto to be\r\nthe greatest of Italian poets, are held among the Italians of to-day.\r\nIf we can fancy some witty, genial writer, we will say in Florence,\r\nfinding himself bored by all the poets I have named, we can yet believe\r\nhe would be unwilling to admit that he disliked them without exception.\r\nHe would prefer to think he could see something at any rate in Dante,\r\nwhom he could idealise more easily, inasmuch as he was more remote; in\r\norder to carry his countrymen the farther with him, he would endeavour\r\nto meet them more than was consistent with his own instincts. Without\r\nsome such palliation as admiration for one, at any rate, of the\r\ntragedians, it would be almost as dangerous for Aristophanes to attack\r\nthem as it would be for an Englishman now to say that he did not think\r\nvery much of the Elizabethan dramatists. Yet which of us in his heart\r\nlikes any of the Elizabethan dramatists except Shakespeare? Are they in\r\nreality anything else than literary Struldbrugs?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI conclude upon the whole that Aristophanes did not like any of the\r\ntragedians; yet no one will deny that this keen, witty, outspoken\r\nwriter was as good a judge of literary value, and as able to see any\r\nbeauties that the tragic dramas contained as nine-tenths, at any rate,\r\nof ourselves. He had, moreover, the advantage of thoroughly\r\nunderstanding the standpoint from which the tragedians expected their\r\nwork to be judged, and what was his conclusion? Briefly it was little\r\nelse than this, that they were a fraud or something very like it. For\r\nmy own part I cordially agree with him. I am free to confess that with\r\nthe exception perhaps of some of the Psalms of David I know no writings\r\nwhich seem so little to deserve their reputation. I do not know that I\r\nshould particularly mind my sisters reading them, but I will take good\r\ncare never to read them myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis last bit about the Psalms was awful, and there was a great fight\r\nwith the editor as to whether or no it should be allowed to stand.\r\nErnest himself was frightened at it, but he had once heard someone say\r\nthat the Psalms were many of them very poor, and on looking at them\r\nmore closely, after he had been told this, he found that there could\r\nhardly be two opinions on the subject. So he caught up the remark and\r\nreproduced it as his own, concluding that these psalms had probably\r\nnever been written by David at all, but had got in among the others by\r\nmistake.\r\n\r\nThe essay, perhaps on account of the passage about the Psalms, created\r\nquite a sensation, and on the whole was well received. Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s friends\r\npraised it more highly than it deserved, and he was himself very proud\r\nof it, but he dared not show it at Battersby. He knew also that he was\r\nnow at the end of his tether; this was his one idea (I feel sure he had\r\ncaught more than half of it from other people), and now he had not\r\nanother thing left to write about. He found himself cursed with a small\r\nreputation which seemed to him much bigger than it was, and a\r\nconsciousness that he could never keep it up. Before many days were\r\nover he felt his unfortunate essay to be a white elephant to him, which\r\nhe must feed by hurrying into all sorts of frantic attempts to cap his\r\ntriumph, and, as may be imagined, these attempts were failures.\r\n\r\nHe did not understand that if he waited and listened and observed,\r\nanother idea of some kind would probably occur to him some day, and\r\nthat the development of this would in its turn suggest still further\r\nones. He did not yet know that the very worst way of getting hold of\r\nideas is to go hunting expressly after them. The way to get them is to\r\nstudy something of which one is fond, and to note down whatever crosses\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s mind in reference to it, either during study or relaxation, in a\r\nlittle note-book kept always in the waistcoat pocket. Ernest has come\r\nto know all about this now, but it took him a long time to find it out,\r\nfor this is not the kind of thing that is taught at schools and\r\nuniversities.\r\n\r\nNor yet did he know that ideas, no less than the living beings in whose\r\nminds they arise, must be begotten by parents not very unlike\r\nthemselves, the most original still differing but slightly from the\r\nparents that have given rise to them. Life is like a fugue, everything\r\nmust grow out of the subject and there must be nothing new. Nor, again,\r\ndid he see how hard it is to say where one idea ends and another\r\nbegins, nor yet how closely this is paralleled in the difficulty of\r\nsaying where a life begins or ends, or an action or indeed anything,\r\nthere being an unity in spite of infinite multitude, and an infinite\r\nmultitude in spite of unity. He thought that ideas came into clever\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s heads by a kind of spontaneous germination, without parentage\r\nin the thoughts of others or the course of observation; for as yet he\r\nbelieved in genius, of which he well knew that he had none, if it was\r\nthe fine frenzied thing he thought it was.\r\n\r\nNot very long before this he had come of age, and Theobald had handed\r\nhim over his money, which amounted now to \xc2\xa35000; it was invested to\r\nbring in 5 per cent and gave him therefore an income of \xc2\xa3250 a year. He\r\ndid not, however, realise the fact (he could realise nothing so foreign\r\nto his experience) that he was independent of his father till a long\r\ntime afterwards; nor did Theobald make any difference in his manner\r\ntowards him. So strong was the hold which habit and association held\r\nover both father and son, that the one considered he had as good a\r\nright as ever to dictate, and the other that he had as little right as\r\never to gainsay.\r\n\r\nDuring his last year at Cambridge he overworked himself through this\r\nvery blind deference to his father\xe2\x80\x99s wishes, for there was no reason\r\nwhy he should take more than a poll degree except that his father laid\r\nsuch stress upon his taking honours. He became so ill, indeed, that it\r\nwas doubtful how far he would be able to go in for his degree at all;\r\nbut he managed to do so, and when the list came out was found to be\r\nplaced higher than either he or anyone else expected, being among the\r\nfirst three or four senior optimes, and a few weeks later, in the lower\r\nhalf of the second class of the Classical Tripos. Ill as he was when he\r\ngot home, Theobald made him go over all the examination papers with\r\nhim, and in fact reproduce as nearly as possible the replies that he\r\nhad sent in. So little kick had he in him, and so deep was the groove\r\ninto which he had got, that while at home he spent several hours a day\r\nin continuing his classical and mathematical studies as though he had\r\nnot yet taken his degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\n\r\nErnest returned to Cambridge for the May term of 1858, on the plea of\r\nreading for ordination, with which he was now face to face, and much\r\nnearer than he liked. Up to this time, though not religiously inclined,\r\nhe had never doubted the truth of anything that had been told him about\r\nChristianity. He had never seen anyone who doubted, nor read anything\r\nthat raised a suspicion in his mind as to the historical character of\r\nthe miracles recorded in the Old and New Testaments.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the year 1858 was the last of a term during\r\nwhich the peace of the Church of England was singularly unbroken.\r\nBetween 1844, when \xe2\x80\x9cVestiges of Creation\xe2\x80\x9d appeared, and 1859, when\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEssays and Reviews\xe2\x80\x9d marked the commencement of that storm which raged\r\nuntil many years afterwards, there was not a single book published in\r\nEngland that caused serious commotion within the bosom of the Church.\r\nPerhaps Buckle\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cHistory of Civilisation\xe2\x80\x9d and Mill\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLiberty\xe2\x80\x9d were\r\nthe most alarming, but they neither of them reached the substratum of\r\nthe reading public, and Ernest and his friends were ignorant of their\r\nvery existence. The Evangelical movement, with the exception to which I\r\nshall revert presently, had become almost a matter of ancient history.\r\nTractarianism had subsided into a tenth day\xe2\x80\x99s wonder; it was at work,\r\nbut it was not noisy. The \xe2\x80\x9cVestiges\xe2\x80\x9d were forgotten before Ernest went\r\nup to Cambridge; the Catholic aggression scare had lost its terrors;\r\nRitualism was still unknown by the general provincial public, and the\r\nGorham and Hampden controversies were defunct some years since; Dissent\r\nwas not spreading; the Crimean war was the one engrossing subject, to\r\nbe followed by the Indian Mutiny and the Franco-Austrian war. These\r\ngreat events turned men\xe2\x80\x99s minds from speculative subjects, and there\r\nwas no enemy to the faith which could arouse even a languid interest.\r\nAt no time probably since the beginning of the century could an\r\nordinary observer have detected less sign of coming disturbance than at\r\nthat of which I am writing.\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that the calm was only on the surface. Older men, who\r\nknew more than undergraduates were likely to do, must have seen that\r\nthe wave of scepticism which had already broken over Germany was\r\nsetting towards our own shores, nor was it long, indeed, before it\r\nreached them. Ernest had hardly been ordained before three works in\r\nquick succession arrested the attention even of those who paid least\r\nheed to theological controversy. I mean \xe2\x80\x9cEssays and Reviews,\xe2\x80\x9d Charles\r\nDarwin\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cOrigin of Species,\xe2\x80\x9d and Bishop Colenso\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCriticisms on the\r\nPentateuch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis, however, is a digression; I must revert to the one phase of\r\nspiritual activity which had any life in it during the time Ernest was\r\nat Cambridge, that is to say, to the remains of the Evangelical\r\nawakening of more than a generation earlier, which was connected with\r\nthe name of Simeon.\r\n\r\nThere were still a good many Simeonites, or as they were more briefly\r\ncalled \xe2\x80\x9cSims,\xe2\x80\x9d in Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s time. Every college contained some of them,\r\nbut their headquarters were at Caius, whither they were attracted by Mr\r\nClayton who was at that time senior tutor, and among the sizars of St\r\nJohn\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nBehind the then chapel of this last-named college, there was a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clabyrinth\xe2\x80\x9d (this was the name it bore) of dingy, tumble-down rooms,\r\ntenanted exclusively by the poorest undergraduates, who were dependent\r\nupon sizarships and scholarships for the means of taking their degrees.\r\nTo many, even at St John\xe2\x80\x99s, the existence and whereabouts of the\r\nlabyrinth in which the sizars chiefly lived was unknown; some men in\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x99s time, who had rooms in the first court, had never found their\r\nway through the sinuous passage which led to it.\r\n\r\nIn the labyrinth there dwelt men of all ages, from mere lads to\r\ngrey-haired old men who had entered late in life. They were rarely seen\r\nexcept in hall or chapel or at lecture, where their manners of feeding,\r\npraying and studying, were considered alike objectionable; no one knew\r\nwhence they came, whither they went, nor what they did, for they never\r\nshowed at cricket or the boats; they were a gloomy, seedy-looking\r\n_conf\xc3\xa9rie_, who had as little to glory in in clothes and manners as in\r\nthe flesh itself.\r\n\r\nErnest and his friends used to consider themselves marvels of economy\r\nfor getting on with so little money, but the greater number of dwellers\r\nin the labyrinth would have considered one-half of their expenditure to\r\nbe an exceeding measure of affluence, and so doubtless any domestic\r\ntyranny which had been experienced by Ernest was a small thing to what\r\nthe average Johnian sizar had had to put up with.\r\n\r\nA few would at once emerge on its being found after their first\r\nexamination that they were likely to be ornaments to the college; these\r\nwould win valuable scholarships that enabled them to live in some\r\ndegree of comfort, and would amalgamate with the more studious of those\r\nwho were in a better social position, but even these, with few\r\nexceptions, were long in shaking off the uncouthness they brought with\r\nthem to the University, nor would their origin cease to be easily\r\nrecognisable till they had become dons and tutors. I have seen some of\r\nthese men attain high position in the world of politics or science, and\r\nyet still retain a look of labyrinth and Johnian sizarship.\r\n\r\nUnprepossessing then, in feature, gait and manners, unkempt and\r\nill-dressed beyond what can be easily described, these poor fellows\r\nformed a class apart, whose thoughts and ways were not as the thoughts\r\nand ways of Ernest and his friends, and it was among them that\r\nSimeonism chiefly flourished.\r\n\r\nDestined most of them for the Church (for in those days \xe2\x80\x9choly orders\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwere seldom heard of), the Simeonites held themselves to have received\r\na very loud call to the ministry, and were ready to pinch themselves\r\nfor years so as to prepare for it by the necessary theological courses.\r\nTo most of them the fact of becoming clergymen would be the _entr\xc3\xa9e_\r\ninto a social position from which they were at present kept out by\r\nbarriers they well knew to be impassable; ordination, therefore, opened\r\nfields for ambition which made it the central point in their thoughts,\r\nrather than as with Ernest, something which he supposed would have to\r\nbe done some day, but about which, as about dying, he hoped there was\r\nno need to trouble himself as yet.\r\n\r\nBy way of preparing themselves more completely they would have meetings\r\nin one another\xe2\x80\x99s rooms for tea and prayer and other spiritual\r\nexercises. Placing themselves under the guidance of a few well-known\r\ntutors they would teach in Sunday Schools, and be instant, in season\r\nand out of season, in imparting spiritual instruction to all whom they\r\ncould persuade to listen to them.\r\n\r\nBut the soil of the more prosperous undergraduates was not suitable for\r\nthe seed they tried to sow. The small pieties with which they larded\r\ntheir discourse, if chance threw them into the company of one whom they\r\nconsidered worldly, caused nothing but aversion in the minds of those\r\nfor whom they were intended. When they distributed tracts, dropping\r\nthem by night into good men\xe2\x80\x99s letter boxes while they were asleep,\r\ntheir tracts got burnt, or met with even worse contumely; they were\r\nthemselves also treated with the ridicule which they reflected proudly\r\nhad been the lot of true followers of Christ in all ages. Often at\r\ntheir prayer meetings was the passage of St Paul referred to in which\r\nhe bids his Corinthian converts note concerning themselves that they\r\nwere for the most part neither well-bred nor intellectual people. They\r\nreflected with pride that they too had nothing to be proud of in these\r\nrespects, and like St Paul, gloried in the fact that in the flesh they\r\nhad not much to glory.\r\n\r\nErnest had several Johnian friends, and came thus to hear about the\r\nSimeonites and to see some of them, who were pointed out to him as they\r\npassed through the courts. They had a repellent attraction for him; he\r\ndisliked them, but he could not bring himself to leave them alone. On\r\none occasion he had gone so far as to parody one of the tracts they had\r\nsent round in the night, and to get a copy dropped into each of the\r\nleading Simeonites\xe2\x80\x99 boxes. The subject he had taken was \xe2\x80\x9cPersonal\r\nCleanliness.\xe2\x80\x9d Cleanliness, he said, was next to godliness; he wished to\r\nknow on which side it was to stand, and concluded by exhorting\r\nSimeonites to a freer use of the tub. I cannot commend my hero\xe2\x80\x99s humour\r\nin this matter; his tract was not brilliant, but I mention the fact as\r\nshowing that at this time he was something of a Saul and took pleasure\r\nin persecuting the elect, not, as I have said, that he had any\r\nhankering after scepticism, but because, like the farmers in his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s village, though he would not stand seeing the Christian\r\nreligion made light of, he was not going to see it taken seriously.\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x99s friends thought his dislike for Simeonites was due to his\r\nbeing the son of a clergyman who, it was known, bullied him; it is more\r\nlikely, however, that it rose from an unconscious sympathy with them,\r\nwhich, as in St Paul\xe2\x80\x99s case, in the end drew him into the ranks of\r\nthose whom he had most despised and hated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce, recently, when he was down at home after taking his degree, his\r\nmother had had a short conversation with him about his becoming a\r\nclergyman, set on thereto by Theobald, who shrank from the subject\r\nhimself. This time it was during a turn taken in the garden, and not on\r\nthe sofa\xe2\x80\x94which was reserved for supreme occasions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, my dearest boy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cthat papa\xe2\x80\x9d (she always\r\ncalled Theobald \xe2\x80\x9cpapa\xe2\x80\x9d when talking to Ernest) \xe2\x80\x9cis so anxious you\r\nshould not go into the Church blindly, and without fully realising the\r\ndifficulties of a clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s position. He has considered all of them\r\nhimself, and has been shown how small they are, when they are faced\r\nboldly, but he wishes you, too, to feel them as strongly and completely\r\nas possible before committing yourself to irrevocable vows, so that you\r\nmay never, never have to regret the step you will have taken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the first time Ernest had heard that there were any\r\ndifficulties, and he not unnaturally enquired in a vague way after\r\ntheir nature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, my dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Christina, \xe2\x80\x9cis a question which I am not\r\nfitted to enter upon either by nature or education. I might easily\r\nunsettle your mind without being able to settle it again. Oh, no! Such\r\nquestions are far better avoided by women, and, I should have thought,\r\nby men, but papa wished me to speak to you upon the subject, so that\r\nthere might be no mistake hereafter, and I have done so. Now,\r\ntherefore, you know all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe conversation ended here, so far as this subject was concerned, and\r\nErnest thought he did know all. His mother would not have told him he\r\nknew all\xe2\x80\x94not about a matter of that sort\xe2\x80\x94unless he actually did know\r\nit; well, it did not come to very much; he supposed there were some\r\ndifficulties, but his father, who at any rate was an excellent scholar\r\nand a learned man, was probably quite right here, and he need not\r\ntrouble himself more about them. So little impression did the\r\nconversation make on him, that it was not till long afterwards that,\r\nhappening to remember it, he saw what a piece of sleight of hand had\r\nbeen practised upon him. Theobald and Christina, however, were\r\nsatisfied that they had done their duty by opening their son\xe2\x80\x99s eyes to\r\nthe difficulties of assenting to all a clergyman must assent to. This\r\nwas enough; it was a matter for rejoicing that, though they had been\r\nput so fully and candidly before him, he did not find them serious. It\r\nwas not in vain that they had prayed for so many years to be made\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_truly_ honest and conscientious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Christina, after having disposed of all the\r\ndifficulties that might stand in the way of Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s becoming a\r\nclergyman, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is another matter on which I should like to have a\r\ntalk with you. It is about your sister Charlotte. You know how clever\r\nshe is, and what a dear, kind sister she has been and always will be to\r\nyourself and Joey. I wish, my dearest Ernest, that I saw more chance of\r\nher finding a suitable husband than I do at Battersby, and I sometimes\r\nthink you might do more than you do to help her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest began to chafe at this, for he had heard it so often, but he\r\nsaid nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, my dear, a brother can do so much for his sister if he lays\r\nhimself out to do it. A mother can do very little\xe2\x80\x94indeed, it is hardly\r\na mother\xe2\x80\x99s place to seek out young men; it is a brother\xe2\x80\x99s place to find\r\na suitable partner for his sister; all that I can do is to try to make\r\nBattersby as attractive as possible to any of your friends whom you may\r\ninvite. And in that,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with a little toss of her head, \xe2\x80\x9cI do\r\nnot think I have been deficient hitherto.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest said he had already at different times asked several of his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear, but you must admit that they were none of them exactly\r\nthe kind of young man whom Charlotte could be expected to take a fancy\r\nto. Indeed, I must own to having been a little disappointed that you\r\nshould have yourself chosen any of these as your intimate friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest winced again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never brought down Figgins when you were at Roughborough; now I\r\nshould have thought Figgins would have been just the kind of boy whom\r\nyou might have asked to come and see us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFiggins had been gone through times out of number already. Ernest had\r\nhardly known him, and Figgins, being nearly three years older than\r\nErnest, had left long before he did. Besides he had not been a nice\r\nboy, and had made himself unpleasant to Ernest in many ways.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d continued his mother, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s Towneley. I have heard you speak\r\nof Towneley as having rowed with you in a boat at Cambridge. I wish, my\r\ndear, you would cultivate your acquaintance with Towneley, and ask him\r\nto pay us a visit. The name has an aristocratic sound, and I think I\r\nhave heard you say he is an eldest son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest flushed at the sound of Towneley\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\nWhat had really happened in respect of Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s friends was briefly\r\nthis. His mother liked to get hold of the names of the boys and\r\nespecially of any who were at all intimate with her son; the more she\r\nheard, the more she wanted to know; there was no gorging her to\r\nsatiety; she was like a ravenous young cuckoo being fed upon a grass\r\nplot by a water wag-tail, she would swallow all that Ernest could bring\r\nher, and yet be as hungry as before. And she always went to Ernest for\r\nher meals rather than to Joey, for Joey was either more stupid or more\r\nimpenetrable\xe2\x80\x94at any rate she could pump Ernest much the better of the\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time an actual live boy had been thrown to her, either by\r\nbeing caught and brought to Battersby, or by being asked to meet her if\r\nat any time she came to Roughborough. She had generally made herself\r\nagreeable, or fairly agreeable, as long as the boy was present, but as\r\nsoon as she got Ernest to herself again she changed her note. Into\r\nwhatever form she might throw her criticisms it came always in the end\r\nto this, that his friend was no good, that Ernest was not much better,\r\nand that he should have brought her someone else, for this one would\r\nnot do at all.\r\n\r\nThe more intimate the boy had been or was supposed to be with Ernest\r\nthe more he was declared to be naught, till in the end he had hit upon\r\nthe plan of saying, concerning any boy whom he particularly liked, that\r\nhe was not one of his especial chums, and that indeed he hardly knew\r\nwhy he had asked him; but he found he only fell on Scylla in trying to\r\navoid Charybdis, for though the boy was declared to be more successful\r\nit was Ernest who was naught for not thinking more highly of him.\r\n\r\nWhen she had once got hold of a name she never forgot it. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how is\r\nSo-and-so?\xe2\x80\x9d she would exclaim, mentioning some former friend of\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x99s with whom he had either now quarrelled, or who had long since\r\nproved to be a mere comet and no fixed star at all. How Ernest wished\r\nhe had never mentioned So-and-so\xe2\x80\x99s name, and vowed to himself that he\r\nwould never talk about his friends in future, but in a few hours he\r\nwould forget and would prattle away as imprudently as ever; then his\r\nmother would pounce noiselessly on his remarks as a barn-owl pounces\r\nupon a mouse, and would bring them up in a pellet six months afterwards\r\nwhen they were no longer in harmony with their surroundings.\r\n\r\nThen there was Theobald. If a boy or college friend had been invited to\r\nBattersby, Theobald would lay himself out at first to be agreeable. He\r\ncould do this well enough when he liked, and as regards the outside\r\nworld he generally did like. His clerical neighbours, and indeed all\r\nhis neighbours, respected him yearly more and more, and would have\r\ngiven Ernest sufficient cause to regret his imprudence if he had dared\r\nto hint that he had anything, however little, to complain of.\r\nTheobald\xe2\x80\x99s mind worked in this way: \xe2\x80\x9cNow, I know Ernest has told this\r\nboy what a disagreeable person I am, and I will just show him that I am\r\nnot disagreeable at all, but a good old fellow, a jolly old boy, in\r\nfact a regular old brick, and that it is Ernest who is in fault all\r\nthrough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he would behave very nicely to the boy at first, and the boy would\r\nbe delighted with him, and side with him against Ernest. Of course if\r\nErnest had got the boy to come to Battersby he wanted him to enjoy his\r\nvisit, and was therefore pleased that Theobald should behave so well,\r\nbut at the same time he stood so much in need of moral support that it\r\nwas painful to him to see one of his own familiar friends go over to\r\nthe enemy\xe2\x80\x99s camp. For no matter how well we may know a thing\xe2\x80\x94how\r\nclearly we may see a certain patch of colour, for example, as red, it\r\nshakes us and knocks us about to find another see it, or be more than\r\nhalf inclined to see it, as green.\r\n\r\nTheobald had generally begun to get a little impatient before the end\r\nof the visit, but the impression formed during the earlier part was the\r\none which the visitor had carried away with him. Theobald never\r\ndiscussed any of the boys with Ernest. It was Christina who did this.\r\nTheobald let them come, because Christina in a quiet, persistent way\r\ninsisted on it; when they did come he behaved, as I have said, civilly,\r\nbut he did not like it, whereas Christina did like it very much; she\r\nwould have had half Roughborough and half Cambridge to come and stay at\r\nBattersby if she could have managed it, and if it would not have cost\r\nso much money: she liked their coming, so that she might make a new\r\nacquaintance, and she liked tearing them to pieces and flinging the\r\nbits over Ernest as soon as she had had enough of them.\r\n\r\nThe worst of it was that she had so often proved to be right. Boys and\r\nyoung men are violent in their affections, but they are seldom very\r\nconstant; it is not till they get older that they really know the kind\r\nof friend they want; in their earlier essays young men are simply\r\nlearning to judge character. Ernest had been no exception to the\r\ngeneral rule. His swans had one after the other proved to be more or\r\nless geese even in his own estimation, and he was beginning almost to\r\nthink that his mother was a better judge of character than he was; but\r\nI think it may be assumed with some certainty that if Ernest had\r\nbrought her a real young swan she would have declared it to be the\r\nugliest and worst goose of all that she had yet seen.\r\n\r\nAt first he had not suspected that his friends were wanted with a view\r\nto Charlotte; it was understood that Charlotte and they might perhaps\r\ntake a fancy for one another; and that would be so very nice, would it\r\nnot? But he did not see that there was any deliberate malice in the\r\narrangement. Now, however, that he had awoke to what it all meant, he\r\nwas less inclined to bring any friend of his to Battersby. It seemed to\r\nhis silly young mind almost dishonest to ask your friend to come and\r\nsee you when all you really meant was \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, marry my sister.\xe2\x80\x9d It was\r\nlike trying to obtain money under false pretences. If he had been fond\r\nof Charlotte it might have been another matter, but he thought her one\r\nof the most disagreeable young women in the whole circle of his\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\nShe was supposed to be very clever. All young ladies are either very\r\npretty or very clever or very sweet; they may take their choice as to\r\nwhich category they will go in for, but go in for one of the three they\r\nmust. It was hopeless to try and pass Charlotte off as either pretty or\r\nsweet. So she became clever as the only remaining alternative. Ernest\r\nnever knew what particular branch of study it was in which she showed\r\nher talent, for she could neither play nor sing nor draw, but so astute\r\nare women that his mother and Charlotte really did persuade him into\r\nthinking that she, Charlotte, had something more akin to true genius\r\nthan any other member of the family. Not one, however, of all the\r\nfriends whom Ernest had been inveigled into trying to inveigle had\r\nshown the least sign of being so far struck with Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s commanding\r\npowers, as to wish to make them his own, and this may have had\r\nsomething to do with the rapidity and completeness with which Christina\r\nhad dismissed them one after another and had wanted a new one.\r\n\r\nAnd now she wanted Towneley. Ernest had seen this coming and had tried\r\nto avoid it, for he knew how impossible it was for him to ask Towneley,\r\neven if he had wished to do so.\r\n\r\nTowneley belonged to one of the most exclusive sets in Cambridge, and\r\nwas perhaps the most popular man among the whole number of\r\nundergraduates. He was big and very handsome\xe2\x80\x94as it seemed to Ernest the\r\nhandsomest man whom he ever had seen or ever could see, for it was\r\nimpossible to imagine a more lively and agreeable countenance. He was\r\ngood at cricket and boating, very good-natured, singularly free from\r\nconceit, not clever but very sensible, and, lastly, his father and\r\nmother had been drowned by the overturning of a boat when he was only\r\ntwo years old and had left him as their only child and heir to one of\r\nthe finest estates in the South of England. Fortune every now and then\r\ndoes things handsomely by a man all round; Towneley was one of those to\r\nwhom she had taken a fancy, and the universal verdict in this case was\r\nthat she had chosen wisely.\r\n\r\nErnest had seen Towneley as every one else in the University (except,\r\nof course, dons) had seen him, for he was a man of mark, and being very\r\nsusceptible he had liked Towneley even more than most people did, but\r\nat the same time it never so much as entered his head that he should\r\ncome to know him. He liked looking at him if he got a chance, and was\r\nvery much ashamed of himself for doing so, but there the matter ended.\r\n\r\nBy a strange accident, however, during Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s last year, when the\r\nnames of the crews for the scratch fours were drawn he had found\r\nhimself coxswain of a crew, among whom was none other than his especial\r\nhero Towneley; the three others were ordinary mortals, but they could\r\nrow fairly well, and the crew on the whole was rather a good one.\r\n\r\nErnest was frightened out of his wits. When, however, the two met, he\r\nfound Towneley no less remarkable for his entire want of anything like\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cside,\xe2\x80\x9d and for his power of setting those whom he came across at their\r\nease, than he was for outward accomplishments; the only difference he\r\nfound between Towneley and other people was that he was so very much\r\neasier to get on with. Of course Ernest worshipped him more and more.\r\n\r\nThe scratch fours being ended the connection between the two came to an\r\nend, but Towneley never passed Ernest thenceforward without a nod and a\r\nfew good-natured words. In an evil moment he had mentioned Towneley\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname at Battersby, and now what was the result? Here was his mother\r\nplaguing him to ask Towneley to come down to Battersby and marry\r\nCharlotte. Why, if he had thought there was the remotest chance of\r\nTowneley\xe2\x80\x99s marrying Charlotte he would have gone down on his knees to\r\nhim and told him what an odious young woman she was, and implored him\r\nto save himself while there was yet time.\r\n\r\nBut Ernest had not prayed to be made \xe2\x80\x9ctruly honest and conscientious\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nfor as many years as Christina had. He tried to conceal what he felt\r\nand thought as well as he could, and led the conversation back to the\r\ndifficulties which a clergyman might feel to stand in the way of his\r\nbeing ordained\xe2\x80\x94not because he had any misgivings, but as a diversion.\r\nHis mother, however, thought she had settled all that, and he got no\r\nmore out of her. Soon afterwards he found the means of escaping, and\r\nwas not slow to avail himself of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX\r\n\r\n\r\nOn his return to Cambridge in the May term of 1858, Ernest and a few\r\nother friends who were also intended for orders came to the conclusion\r\nthat they must now take a more serious view of their position. They\r\ntherefore attended chapel more regularly than hitherto, and held\r\nevening meetings of a somewhat furtive character, at which they would\r\nstudy the New Testament. They even began to commit the Epistles of St\r\nPaul to memory in the original Greek. They got up Beveridge on the\r\nThirty-nine Articles, and Pearson on the Creed; in their hours of\r\nrecreation they read More\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cMystery of Godliness,\xe2\x80\x9d which Ernest\r\nthought was charming, and Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cHoly Living and Dying,\xe2\x80\x9d which also\r\nimpressed him deeply, through what he thought was the splendour of its\r\nlanguage. They handed themselves over to the guidance of Dean Alford\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnotes on the Greek Testament, which made Ernest better understand what\r\nwas meant by \xe2\x80\x9cdifficulties,\xe2\x80\x9d but also made him feel how shallow and\r\nimpotent were the conclusions arrived at by German neologians, with\r\nwhose works, being innocent of German, he was not otherwise acquainted.\r\nSome of the friends who joined him in these pursuits were Johnians, and\r\nthe meetings were often held within the walls of St John\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nI do not know how tidings of these furtive gatherings had reached the\r\nSimeonites, but they must have come round to them in some way, for they\r\nhad not been continued many weeks before a circular was sent to each of\r\nthe young men who attended them, informing them that the Rev. Gideon\r\nHawke, a well-known London Evangelical preacher, whose sermons were\r\nthen much talked of, was about to visit his young friend Badcock of St\r\nJohn\xe2\x80\x99s, and would be glad to say a few words to any who might wish to\r\nhear them, in Badcock\xe2\x80\x99s rooms on a certain evening in May.\r\n\r\nBadcock was one of the most notorious of all the Simeonites. Not only\r\nwas he ugly, dirty, ill-dressed, bumptious, and in every way\r\nobjectionable, but he was deformed and waddled when he walked so that\r\nhe had won a nick-name which I can only reproduce by calling it \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmy back, and there\xe2\x80\x99s my back,\xe2\x80\x9d because the lower parts of his back\r\nemphasised themselves demonstratively as though about to fly off in\r\ndifferent directions like the two extreme notes in the chord of the\r\naugmented sixth, with every step he took. It may be guessed, therefore,\r\nthat the receipt of the circular had for a moment an almost paralysing\r\neffect on those to whom it was addressed, owing to the astonishment\r\nwhich it occasioned them. It certainly was a daring surprise, but like\r\nso many deformed people, Badcock was forward and hard to check; he was\r\na pushing fellow to whom the present was just the opportunity he wanted\r\nfor carrying war into the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s quarters.\r\n\r\nErnest and his friends consulted. Moved by the feeling that as they\r\nwere now preparing to be clergymen they ought not to stand so stiffly\r\non social dignity as heretofore, and also perhaps by the desire to have\r\na good private view of a preacher who was then much upon the lips of\r\nmen, they decided to accept the invitation. When the appointed time\r\ncame they went with some confusion and self-abasement to the rooms of\r\nthis man, on whom they had looked down hitherto as from an immeasurable\r\nheight, and with whom nothing would have made them believe a few weeks\r\nearlier that they could ever come to be on speaking terms.\r\n\r\nMr Hawke was a very different-looking person from Badcock. He was\r\nremarkably handsome, or rather would have been but for the thinness of\r\nhis lips, and a look of too great firmness and inflexibility. His\r\nfeatures were a good deal like those of Leonardo da Vinci; moreover he\r\nwas kempt, looked in vigorous health, and was of a ruddy countenance.\r\nHe was extremely courteous in his manner, and paid a good deal of\r\nattention to Badcock, of whom he seemed to think highly. Altogether our\r\nyoung friends were taken aback, and inclined to think smaller beer of\r\nthemselves and larger of Badcock than was agreeable to the old Adam who\r\nwas still alive within them. A few well-known \xe2\x80\x9cSims\xe2\x80\x9d from St John\xe2\x80\x99s and\r\nother colleges were present, but not enough to swamp the Ernest set, as\r\nfor the sake of brevity, I will call them.\r\n\r\nAfter a preliminary conversation in which there was nothing to offend,\r\nthe business of the evening began by Mr Hawke\xe2\x80\x99s standing up at one end\r\nof the table, and saying \xe2\x80\x9cLet us pray.\xe2\x80\x9d The Ernest set did not like\r\nthis, but they could not help themselves, so they knelt down and\r\nrepeated the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Prayer and a few others after Mr Hawke, who\r\ndelivered them remarkably well. Then, when all had sat down, Mr Hawke\r\naddressed them, speaking without notes and taking for his text the\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x9cSaul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?\xe2\x80\x9d Whether owing to Mr\r\nHawke\xe2\x80\x99s manner, which was impressive, or to his well-known reputation\r\nfor ability, or whether from the fact that each one of the Ernest set\r\nknew that he had been more or less a persecutor of the \xe2\x80\x9cSims\xe2\x80\x9d and yet\r\nfelt instinctively that the \xe2\x80\x9cSims\xe2\x80\x9d were after all much more like the\r\nearly Christians than he was himself\xe2\x80\x94at any rate the text, familiar\r\nthough it was, went home to the consciences of Ernest and his friends\r\nas it had never yet done. If Mr Hawke had stopped here he would have\r\nalmost said enough; as he scanned the faces turned towards him, and saw\r\nthe impression he had made, he was perhaps minded to bring his sermon\r\nto an end before beginning it, but if so, he reconsidered himself and\r\nproceeded as follows. I give the sermon in full, for it is a typical\r\none, and will explain a state of mind which in another generation or\r\ntwo will seem to stand sadly in need of explanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy young friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Hawke, \xe2\x80\x9cI am persuaded there is not one of\r\nyou here who doubts the existence of a Personal God. If there were, it\r\nis to him assuredly that I should first address myself. Should I be\r\nmistaken in my belief that all here assembled accept the existence of a\r\nGod who is present amongst us though we see him not, and whose eye is\r\nupon our most secret thoughts, let me implore the doubter to confer\r\nwith me in private before we part; I will then put before him\r\nconsiderations through which God has been mercifully pleased to reveal\r\nhimself to me, so far as man can understand him, and which I have found\r\nbring peace to the minds of others who have doubted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI assume also that there is none who doubts but that this God, after\r\nwhose likeness we have been made, did in the course of time have pity\r\nupon man\xe2\x80\x99s blindness, and assume our nature, taking flesh and coming\r\ndown and dwelling among us as a man indistinguishable physically from\r\nourselves. He who made the sun, moon and stars, the world and all that\r\ntherein is, came down from Heaven in the person of his Son, with the\r\nexpress purpose of leading a scorned life, and dying the most cruel,\r\nshameful death which fiendish ingenuity has invented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile on earth he worked many miracles. He gave sight to the blind,\r\nraised the dead to life, fed thousands with a few loaves and fishes,\r\nand was seen to walk upon the waves, but at the end of his appointed\r\ntime he died, as was foredetermined, upon the cross, and was buried by\r\na few faithful friends. Those, however, who had put him to death set a\r\njealous watch over his tomb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no one, I feel sure, in this room who doubts any part of the\r\nforegoing, but if there is, let me again pray him to confer with me in\r\nprivate, and I doubt not that by the blessing of God his doubts will\r\ncease.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next day but one after our Lord was buried, the tomb being still\r\njealously guarded by enemies, an angel was seen descending from Heaven\r\nwith glittering raiment and a countenance that shone like fire. This\r\nglorious being rolled away the stone from the grave, and our Lord\r\nhimself came forth, risen from the dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy young friends, this is no fanciful story like those of the ancient\r\ndeities, but a matter of plain history as certain as that you and I are\r\nnow here together. If there is one fact better vouched for than another\r\nin the whole range of certainties it is the Resurrection of Jesus\r\nChrist; nor is it less well assured that a few weeks after he had risen\r\nfrom the dead, our Lord was seen by many hundreds of men and women to\r\nrise amid a host of angels into the air upon a heavenward journey till\r\nthe clouds covered him and concealed him from the sight of men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be said that the truth of these statements has been denied, but\r\nwhat, let me ask you, has become of the questioners? Where are they\r\nnow? Do we see them or hear of them? Have they been able to hold what\r\nlittle ground they made during the supineness of the last century? Is\r\nthere one of your fathers or mothers or friends who does not see\r\nthrough them? Is there a single teacher or preacher in this great\r\nUniversity who has not examined what these men had to say, and found it\r\nnaught? Did you ever meet one of them, or do you find any of their\r\nbooks securing the respectful attention of those competent to judge\r\nconcerning them? I think not; and I think also you know as well as I do\r\nwhy it is that they have sunk back into the abyss from which they for a\r\ntime emerged: it is because after the most careful and patient\r\nexamination by the ablest and most judicial minds of many countries,\r\ntheir arguments were found so untenable that they themselves renounced\r\nthem. They fled from the field routed, dismayed, and suing for peace;\r\nnor have they again come to the front in any civilised country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know these things. Why, then, do I insist upon them? My dear young\r\nfriends, your own consciousness will have made the answer to each one\r\nof you already; it is because, though you know so well that these\r\nthings did verily and indeed happen, you know also that you have not\r\nrealised them to yourselves as it was your duty to do, nor heeded their\r\nmomentous, awful import.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now let me go further. You all know that you will one day come to\r\ndie, or if not to die\xe2\x80\x94for there are not wanting signs which make me\r\nhope that the Lord may come again, while some of us now present are\r\nalive\xe2\x80\x94yet to be changed; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead\r\nshall be raised incorruptible, for this corruption must put on\r\nincorruption, and this mortal put on immortality, and the saying shall\r\nbe brought to pass that is written, \xe2\x80\x98Death is swallowed up in victory.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you, or do you not believe that you will one day stand before the\r\nJudgement Seat of Christ? Do you, or do you not believe that you will\r\nhave to give an account for every idle word that you have ever spoken?\r\nDo you, or do you not believe that you are called to live, not\r\naccording to the will of man, but according to the will of that Christ\r\nwho came down from Heaven out of love for you, who suffered and died\r\nfor you, who calls you to him, and yearns towards you that you may take\r\nheed even in this your day\xe2\x80\x94but who, if you heed not, will also one day\r\njudge you, and with whom there is no variableness nor shadow of\r\nturning?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear young friends, strait is the gate, and narrow is the way which\r\nleadeth to Eternal Life, and few there be that find it. Few, few, few,\r\nfor he who will not give up ALL for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake, has given up\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you would live in the friendship of this world, if indeed you are\r\nnot prepared to give up everything you most fondly cherish, should the\r\nLord require it of you, then, I say, put the idea of Christ\r\ndeliberately on one side at once. Spit upon him, buffet him, crucify\r\nhim anew, do anything you like so long as you secure the friendship of\r\nthis world while it is still in your power to do so; the pleasures of\r\nthis brief life may not be worth paying for by the torments of\r\neternity, but they are something while they last. If, on the other\r\nhand, you would live in the friendship of God, and be among the number\r\nof those for whom Christ has not died in vain; if, in a word, you value\r\nyour eternal welfare, then give up the friendship of this world; of a\r\nsurety you must make your choice between God and Mammon, for you cannot\r\nserve both.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI put these considerations before you, if so homely a term may be\r\npardoned, as a plain matter of business. There is nothing low or\r\nunworthy in this, as some lately have pretended, for all nature shows\r\nus that there is nothing more acceptable to God than an enlightened\r\nview of our own self-interest; never let anyone delude you here; it is\r\na simple question of fact; did certain things happen or did they not?\r\nIf they did happen, is it reasonable to suppose that you will make\r\nyourselves and others more happy by one course of conduct or by\r\nanother?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now let me ask you what answer you have made to this question\r\nhitherto? Whose friendship have you chosen? If, knowing what you know,\r\nyou have not yet begun to act according to the immensity of the\r\nknowledge that is in you, then he who builds his house and lays up his\r\ntreasure on the edge of a crater of molten lava is a sane, sensible\r\nperson in comparison with yourselves. I say this as no figure of speech\r\nor bugbear with which to frighten you, but as an unvarnished\r\nunexaggerated statement which will be no more disputed by yourselves\r\nthan by me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd now Mr Hawke, who up to this time had spoken with singular\r\nquietness, changed his manner to one of greater warmth and continued\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! my young friends turn, turn, turn, now while it is called\r\nto-day\xe2\x80\x94now from this hour, from this instant; stay not even to gird up\r\nyour loins; look not behind you for a second, but fly into the bosom of\r\nthat Christ who is to be found of all who seek him, and from that\r\nfearful wrath of God which lieth in wait for those who know not the\r\nthings belonging to their peace. For the Son of Man cometh as a thief\r\nin the night, and there is not one of us can tell but what this day his\r\nsoul may be required of him. If there is even one here who has heeded\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he let his eye fall for an instant upon almost all his\r\nhearers, but especially on the Ernest set\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI shall know that it was not\r\nfor nothing that I felt the call of the Lord, and heard as I thought a\r\nvoice by night that bade me come hither quickly, for there was a chosen\r\nvessel who had need of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Mr Hawke ended rather abruptly; his earnest manner, striking\r\ncountenance and excellent delivery had produced an effect greater than\r\nthe actual words I have given can convey to the reader; the virtue lay\r\nin the man more than in what he said; as for the last few mysterious\r\nwords about his having heard a voice by night, their effect was\r\nmagical; there was not one who did not look down to the ground, nor who\r\nin his heart did not half believe that he was the chosen vessel on\r\nwhose especial behalf God had sent Mr Hawke to Cambridge. Even if this\r\nwere not so, each one of them felt that he was now for the first time\r\nin the actual presence of one who had had a direct communication from\r\nthe Almighty, and they were thus suddenly brought a hundredfold nearer\r\nto the New Testament miracles. They were amazed, not to say scared, and\r\nas though by tacit consent they gathered together, thanked Mr Hawke for\r\nhis sermon, said good-night in a humble deferential manner to Badcock\r\nand the other Simeonites, and left the room together. They had heard\r\nnothing but what they had been hearing all their lives; how was it,\r\nthen, that they were so dumbfoundered by it? I suppose partly because\r\nthey had lately begun to think more seriously, and were in a fit state\r\nto be impressed, partly from the greater directness with which each\r\nfelt himself addressed, through the sermon being delivered in a room,\r\nand partly to the logical consistency, freedom from exaggeration, and\r\nprofound air of conviction with which Mr Hawke had spoken. His\r\nsimplicity and obvious earnestness had impressed them even before he\r\nhad alluded to his special mission, but this clenched everything, and\r\nthe words \xe2\x80\x9cLord, is it I?\xe2\x80\x9d were upon the hearts of each as they walked\r\npensively home through moonlit courts and cloisters.\r\n\r\nI do not know what passed among the Simeonites after the Ernest set had\r\nleft them, but they would have been more than mortal if they had not\r\nbeen a good deal elated with the results of the evening. Why, one of\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x99s friends was in the University eleven, and he had actually been\r\nin Badcock\xe2\x80\x99s rooms and had slunk off on saying good-night as meekly as\r\nany of them. It was no small thing to have scored a success like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L\r\n\r\n\r\nErnest felt now that the turning point of his life had come. He would\r\ngive up all for Christ\xe2\x80\x94even his tobacco.\r\n\r\nSo he gathered together his pipes and pouches, and locked them up in\r\nhis portmanteau under his bed where they should be out of sight, and as\r\nmuch out of mind as possible. He did not burn them, because someone\r\nmight come in who wanted to smoke, and though he might abridge his own\r\nliberty, yet, as smoking was not a sin, there was no reason why he\r\nshould be hard on other people.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast he left his rooms to call on a man named Dawson, who\r\nhad been one of Mr Hawke\xe2\x80\x99s hearers on the preceding evening, and who\r\nwas reading for ordination at the forthcoming Ember Weeks, now only\r\nfour months distant. This man had been always of a rather serious turn\r\nof mind\xe2\x80\x94a little too much so for Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s taste; but times had changed,\r\nand Dawson\xe2\x80\x99s undoubted sincerity seemed to render him a fitting\r\ncounsellor for Ernest at the present time. As he was going through the\r\nfirst court of John\xe2\x80\x99s on his way to Dawson\xe2\x80\x99s rooms, he met Badcock, and\r\ngreeted him with some deference. His advance was received with one of\r\nthose ecstatic gleams which shone occasionally upon the face of\r\nBadcock, and which, if Ernest had known more, would have reminded him\r\nof Robespierre. As it was, he saw it and unconsciously recognised the\r\nunrest and self-seekingness of the man, but could not yet formulate\r\nthem; he disliked Badcock more than ever, but as he was going to profit\r\nby the spiritual benefits which he had put in his way, he was bound to\r\nbe civil to him, and civil he therefore was.\r\n\r\nBadcock told him that Mr Hawke had returned to town immediately his\r\ndiscourse was over, but that before doing so he had enquired\r\nparticularly who Ernest and two or three others were. I believe each\r\none of Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s friends was given to understand that he had been more\r\nor less particularly enquired after. Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s vanity\xe2\x80\x94for he was his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s son\xe2\x80\x94was tickled at this; the idea again presented itself to\r\nhim that he might be the one for whose benefit Mr Hawke had been sent.\r\nThere was something, too, in Badcock\xe2\x80\x99s manner which conveyed the idea\r\nthat he could say more if he chose, but had been enjoined to silence.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Dawson\xe2\x80\x99s rooms, he found his friend in raptures over the\r\ndiscourse of the preceding evening. Hardly less delighted was he with\r\nthe effect it had produced on Ernest. He had always known, he said,\r\nthat Ernest would come round; he had been sure of it, but he had hardly\r\nexpected the conversion to be so sudden. Ernest said no more had he,\r\nbut now that he saw his duty so clearly he would get ordained as soon\r\nas possible, and take a curacy, even though the doing so would make him\r\nhave to go down from Cambridge earlier, which would be a great grief to\r\nhim. Dawson applauded this determination, and it was arranged that as\r\nErnest was still more or less of a weak brother, Dawson should take\r\nhim, so to speak, in spiritual tow for a while, and strengthen and\r\nconfirm his faith.\r\n\r\nAn offensive and defensive alliance therefore was struck up between\r\nthis pair (who were in reality singularly ill assorted), and Ernest set\r\nto work to master the books on which the Bishop would examine him.\r\nOthers gradually joined them till they formed a small set or church\r\n(for these are the same things), and the effect of Mr Hawke\xe2\x80\x99s sermon\r\ninstead of wearing off in a few days, as might have been expected,\r\nbecame more and more marked, so much so that it was necessary for\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x99s friends to hold him back rather than urge him on, for he\r\nseemed likely to develop\xe2\x80\x94as indeed he did for a time\xe2\x80\x94into a religious\r\nenthusiast.\r\n\r\nIn one matter only, did he openly backslide. He had, as I said above,\r\nlocked up his pipes and tobacco, so that he might not be tempted to use\r\nthem. All day long on the day after Mr Hawke\xe2\x80\x99s sermon he let them lie\r\nin his portmanteau bravely; but this was not very difficult, as he had\r\nfor some time given up smoking till after hall. After hall this day he\r\ndid not smoke till chapel time, and then went to chapel in\r\nself-defence. When he returned he determined to look at the matter from\r\na common sense point of view. On this he saw that, provided tobacco did\r\nnot injure his health\xe2\x80\x94and he really could not see that it did\xe2\x80\x94it stood\r\nmuch on the same footing as tea or coffee.\r\n\r\nTobacco had nowhere been forbidden in the Bible, but then it had not\r\nyet been discovered, and had probably only escaped proscription for\r\nthis reason. We can conceive of St Paul or even our Lord Himself as\r\ndrinking a cup of tea, but we cannot imagine either of them as smoking\r\na cigarette or a churchwarden. Ernest could not deny this, and admitted\r\nthat Paul would almost certainly have condemned tobacco in good round\r\nterms if he had known of its existence. Was it not then taking rather a\r\nmean advantage of the Apostle to stand on his not having actually\r\nforbidden it? On the other hand, it was possible that God knew Paul\r\nwould have forbidden smoking, and had purposely arranged the discovery\r\nof tobacco for a period at which Paul should be no longer living. This\r\nmight seem rather hard on Paul, considering all he had done for\r\nChristianity, but it would be made up to him in other ways.\r\n\r\nThese reflections satisfied Ernest that on the whole he had better\r\nsmoke, so he sneaked to his portmanteau and brought out his pipes and\r\ntobacco again. There should be moderation he felt in all things, even\r\nin virtue; so for that night he smoked immoderately. It was a pity,\r\nhowever, that he had bragged to Dawson about giving up smoking. The\r\npipes had better be kept in a cupboard for a week or two, till in other\r\nand easier respects Ernest should have proved his steadfastness. Then\r\nthey might steal out again little by little\xe2\x80\x94and so they did.\r\n\r\nErnest now wrote home a letter couched in a vein different from his\r\nordinary ones. His letters were usually all common form and padding,\r\nfor as I have already explained, if he wrote about anything that really\r\ninterested him, his mother always wanted to know more and more about\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94every fresh answer being as the lopping off of a hydra\xe2\x80\x99s head and\r\ngiving birth to half a dozen or more new questions\xe2\x80\x94but in the end it\r\ncame invariably to the same result, namely, that he ought to have done\r\nsomething else, or ought not to go on doing as he proposed. Now,\r\nhowever, there was a new departure, and for the thousandth time he\r\nconcluded that he was about to take a course of which his father and\r\nmother would approve, and in which they would be interested, so that at\r\nlast he and they might get on more sympathetically than heretofore. He\r\ntherefore wrote a gushing impulsive letter, which afforded much\r\namusement to myself as I read it, but which is too long for\r\nreproduction. One passage ran: \xe2\x80\x9cI am now going towards Christ; the\r\ngreater number of my college friends are, I fear, going away from Him;\r\nwe must pray for them that they may find the peace that is in Christ\r\neven as I have myself found it.\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest covered his face with his hands\r\nfor shame as he read this extract from the bundle of letters he had put\r\ninto my hands\xe2\x80\x94they had been returned to him by his father on his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s death, his mother having carefully preserved them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I cut it out?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI will if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cand if good-natured friends have kept\r\nmore records of my follies, pick out any plums that may amuse the\r\nreader, and let him have his laugh over them.\xe2\x80\x9d But fancy what effect a\r\nletter like this\xe2\x80\x94so unled up to\xe2\x80\x94must have produced at Battersby! Even\r\nChristina refrained from ecstasy over her son\xe2\x80\x99s having discovered the\r\npower of Christ\xe2\x80\x99s word, while Theobald was frightened out of his wits.\r\nIt was well his son was not going to have any doubts or difficulties,\r\nand that he would be ordained without making a fuss over it, but he\r\nsmelt mischief in this sudden conversion of one who had never yet shown\r\nany inclination towards religion. He hated people who did not know\r\nwhere to stop. Ernest was always so _outr\xc3\xa9_ and strange; there was\r\nnever any knowing what he would do next, except that it would be\r\nsomething unusual and silly. If he was to get the bit between his teeth\r\nafter he had got ordained and bought his living, he would play more\r\npranks than ever he, Theobald, had done. The fact, doubtless, of his\r\nbeing ordained and having bought a living would go a long way to steady\r\nhim, and if he married, his wife must see to the rest; this was his\r\nonly chance and, to do justice to his sagacity, Theobald in his heart\r\ndid not think very highly of it.\r\n\r\nWhen Ernest came down to Battersby in June, he imprudently tried to\r\nopen up a more unreserved communication with his father than was his\r\nwont. The first of Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s snipe-like flights on being flushed by Mr\r\nHawke\xe2\x80\x99s sermon was in the direction of ultra-evangelicalism. Theobald\r\nhimself had been much more Low than High Church. This was the normal\r\ndevelopment of the country clergyman during the first years of his\r\nclerical life, between, we will say, the years 1825 to 1850; but he was\r\nnot prepared for the almost contempt with which Ernest now regarded the\r\ndoctrines of baptismal regeneration and priestly absolution (Hoity\r\ntoity, indeed, what business had he with such questions?), nor for his\r\ndesire to find some means of reconciling Methodism and the Church.\r\nTheobald hated the Church of Rome, but he hated dissenters too, for he\r\nfound them as a general rule troublesome people to deal with; he always\r\nfound people who did not agree with him troublesome to deal with:\r\nbesides, they set up for knowing as much as he did; nevertheless if he\r\nhad been let alone he would have leaned towards them rather than\r\ntowards the High Church party. The neighbouring clergy, however, would\r\nnot let him alone. One by one they had come under the influence,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, of the Oxford movement which had begun twenty\r\nyears earlier. It was surprising how many practices he now tolerated\r\nwhich in his youth he would have considered Popish; he knew very well\r\ntherefore which way things were going in Church matters, and saw that\r\nas usual Ernest was setting himself the other way. The opportunity for\r\ntelling his son that he was a fool was too favourable not to be\r\nembraced, and Theobald was not slow to embrace it. Ernest was annoyed\r\nand surprised, for had not his father and mother been wanting him to be\r\nmore religious all his life? Now that he had become so they were still\r\nnot satisfied. He said to himself that a prophet was not without honour\r\nsave in his own country, but he had been lately\xe2\x80\x94or rather until\r\nlately\xe2\x80\x94getting into an odious habit of turning proverbs upside down,\r\nand it occurred to him that a country is sometimes not without honour\r\nsave for its own prophet. Then he laughed, and for the rest of the day\r\nfelt more as he used to feel before he had heard Mr Hawke\xe2\x80\x99s sermon.\r\n\r\nHe returned to Cambridge for the Long Vacation of 1858\xe2\x80\x94none too soon,\r\nfor he had to go in for the Voluntary Theological Examination, which\r\nbishops were now beginning to insist upon. He imagined all the time he\r\nwas reading that he was storing himself with the knowledge that would\r\nbest fit him for the work he had taken in hand. In truth, he was\r\ncramming for a pass. In due time he did pass\xe2\x80\x94creditably, and was\r\nordained Deacon with half-a-dozen others of his friends in the autumn\r\nof 1858. He was then just twenty-three years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI\r\n\r\n\r\nErnest had been ordained to a curacy in one of the central parts of\r\nLondon. He hardly knew anything of London yet, but his instincts drew\r\nhim thither. The day after he was ordained he entered upon his\r\nduties\xe2\x80\x94feeling much as his father had done when he found himself boxed\r\nup in the carriage with Christina on the morning of his marriage.\r\nBefore the first three days were over, he became aware that the light\r\nof the happiness which he had known during his four years at Cambridge\r\nhad been extinguished, and he was appalled by the irrevocable nature of\r\nthe step which he now felt that he had taken much too hurriedly.\r\n\r\nThe most charitable excuse that I can make for the vagaries which it\r\nwill now be my duty to chronicle is that the shock of change consequent\r\nupon his becoming suddenly religious, being ordained and leaving\r\nCambridge, had been too much for my hero, and had for the time thrown\r\nhim off an equilibrium which was yet little supported by experience,\r\nand therefore as a matter of course unstable.\r\n\r\nEveryone has a mass of bad work in him which he will have to work off\r\nand get rid of before he can do better\xe2\x80\x94and indeed, the more lasting a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate good work is, the more sure he is to pass through a\r\ntime, and perhaps a very long one, in which there seems very little\r\nhope for him at all. We must all sow our spiritual wild oats. The fault\r\nI feel personally disposed to find with my godson is not that he had\r\nwild oats to sow, but that they were such an exceedingly tame and\r\nuninteresting crop. The sense of humour and tendency to think for\r\nhimself, of which till a few months previously he had been showing fair\r\npromise, were nipped as though by a late frost, while his earlier habit\r\nof taking on trust everything that was told him by those in authority,\r\nand following everything out to the bitter end, no matter how\r\npreposterous, returned with redoubled strength. I suppose this was what\r\nmight have been expected from anyone placed as Ernest now was,\r\nespecially when his antecedents are remembered, but it surprised and\r\ndisappointed some of his cooler-headed Cambridge friends who had begun\r\nto think well of his ability. To himself it seemed that religion was\r\nincompatible with half measures, or even with compromise. Circumstances\r\nhad led to his being ordained; for the moment he was sorry they had,\r\nbut he had done it and must go through with it. He therefore set\r\nhimself to find out what was expected of him, and to act accordingly.\r\n\r\nHis rector was a moderate High Churchman of no very pronounced views\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nelderly man who had had too many curates not to have long since found\r\nout that the connection between rector and curate, like that between\r\nemployer and employed in every other walk of life, was a mere matter of\r\nbusiness. He had now two curates, of whom Ernest was the junior; the\r\nsenior curate was named Pryer, and when this gentleman made advances,\r\nas he presently did, Ernest in his forlorn state was delighted to meet\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nPryer was about twenty-eight years old. He had been at Eton and at\r\nOxford. He was tall, and passed generally for good-looking; I only saw\r\nhim once for about five minutes, and then thought him odious both in\r\nmanners and appearance. Perhaps it was because he caught me up in a way\r\nI did not like. I had quoted Shakespeare for lack of something better\r\nto fill up a sentence\xe2\x80\x94and had said that one touch of nature made the\r\nwhole world kin. \xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pryer, in a bold, brazen way which\r\ndispleased me, \xe2\x80\x9cbut one touch of the unnatural makes it more kindred\r\nstill,\xe2\x80\x9d and he gave me a look as though he thought me an old bore and\r\ndid not care two straws whether I was shocked or not. Naturally enough,\r\nafter this I did not like him.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is anticipating, for it was not till Ernest had been\r\nthree or four months in London that I happened to meet his\r\nfellow-curate, and I must deal here rather with the effect he produced\r\nupon my godson than upon myself. Besides being what was generally\r\nconsidered good-looking, he was faultless in his get-up, and altogether\r\nthe kind of man whom Ernest was sure to be afraid of and yet be taken\r\nin by. The style of his dress was very High Church, and his\r\nacquaintances were exclusively of the extreme High Church party, but he\r\nkept his views a good deal in the background in his rector\xe2\x80\x99s presence,\r\nand that gentleman, though he looked askance on some of Pryer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriends, had no such ground of complaint against him as to make him\r\nsever the connection. Pryer, too, was popular in the pulpit, and, take\r\nhim all round, it was probable that many worse curates would be found\r\nfor one better. When Pryer called on my hero, as soon as the two were\r\nalone together, he eyed him all over with a quick penetrating glance\r\nand seemed not dissatisfied with the result\xe2\x80\x94for I must say here that\r\nErnest had improved in personal appearance under the more genial\r\ntreatment he had received at Cambridge. Pryer, in fact, approved of him\r\nsufficiently to treat him civilly, and Ernest was immediately won by\r\nanyone who did this. It was not long before he discovered that the High\r\nChurch party, and even Rome itself, had more to say for themselves than\r\nhe had thought. This was his first snipe-like change of flight.\r\n\r\nPryer introduced him to several of his friends. They were all of them\r\nyoung clergymen, belonging as I have said to the highest of the High\r\nChurch school, but Ernest was surprised to find how much they resembled\r\nother people when among themselves. This was a shock to him; it was ere\r\nlong a still greater one to find that certain thoughts which he had\r\nwarred against as fatal to his soul, and which he had imagined he\r\nshould lose once for all on ordination, were still as troublesome to\r\nhim as they had been; he also saw plainly enough that the young\r\ngentlemen who formed the circle of Pryer\xe2\x80\x99s friends were in much the\r\nsame unhappy predicament as himself.\r\n\r\nThis was deplorable. The only way out of it that Ernest could see was\r\nthat he should get married at once. But then he did not know any one\r\nwhom he wanted to marry. He did not know any woman, in fact, whom he\r\nwould not rather die than marry. It had been one of Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s and\r\nChristina\xe2\x80\x99s main objects to keep him out of the way of women, and they\r\nhad so far succeeded that women had become to him mysterious,\r\ninscrutable objects to be tolerated when it was impossible to avoid\r\nthem, but never to be sought out or encouraged. As for any man loving,\r\nor even being at all fond of any woman, he supposed it was so, but he\r\nbelieved the greater number of those who professed such sentiments were\r\nliars. Now, however, it was clear that he had hoped against hope too\r\nlong, and that the only thing to do was to go and ask the first woman\r\nwho would listen to him to come and be married to him as soon as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nHe broached this to Pryer, and was surprised to find that this\r\ngentleman, though attentive to such members of his flock as were young\r\nand good-looking, was strongly in favour of the celibacy of the clergy,\r\nas indeed were the other demure young clerics to whom Pryer had\r\nintroduced Ernest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, my dear Pontifex,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pryer to him, some few weeks after\r\nErnest had become acquainted with him, when the two were taking a\r\nconstitutional one day in Kensington Gardens, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, my dear\r\nPontifex, it is all very well to quarrel with Rome, but Rome has\r\nreduced the treatment of the human soul to a science, while our own\r\nChurch, though so much purer in many respects, has no organised system\r\neither of diagnosis or pathology\xe2\x80\x94I mean, of course, spiritual diagnosis\r\nand spiritual pathology. Our Church does not prescribe remedies upon\r\nany settled system, and, what is still worse, even when her physicians\r\nhave according to their lights ascertained the disease and pointed out\r\nthe remedy, she has no discipline which will ensure its being actually\r\napplied. If our patients do not choose to do as we tell them, we cannot\r\nmake them. Perhaps really under all the circumstances this is as well,\r\nfor we are spiritually mere horse doctors as compared with the Roman\r\npriesthood, nor can we hope to make much headway against the sin and\r\nmisery that surround us, till we return in some respects to the\r\npractice of our forefathers and of the greater part of Christendom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest asked in what respects it was that his friend desired a return\r\nto the practice of our forefathers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my dear fellow, can you really be ignorant? It is just this,\r\neither the priest is indeed a spiritual guide, as being able to show\r\npeople how they ought to live better than they can find out for\r\nthemselves, or he is nothing at all\xe2\x80\x94he has no _raison d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xaatre_. If the\r\npriest is not as much a healer and director of men\xe2\x80\x99s souls as a\r\nphysician is of their bodies, what is he? The history of all ages has\r\nshown\xe2\x80\x94and surely you must know this as well as I do\xe2\x80\x94that as men cannot\r\ncure the bodies of their patients if they have not been properly\r\ntrained in hospitals under skilled teachers, so neither can souls be\r\ncured of their more hidden ailments without the help of men who are\r\nskilled in soul-craft\xe2\x80\x94or in other words, of priests. What do one half\r\nof our formularies and rubrics mean if not this? How in the name of all\r\nthat is reasonable can we find out the exact nature of a spiritual\r\nmalady, unless we have had experience of other similar cases? How can\r\nwe get this without express training? At present we have to begin all\r\nexperiments for ourselves, without profiting by the organised\r\nexperience of our predecessors, inasmuch as that experience is never\r\norganised and co-ordinated at all. At the outset, therefore, each one\r\nof us must ruin many souls which could be saved by knowledge of a few\r\nelementary principles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest was very much impressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for men curing themselves,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Pryer, \xe2\x80\x9cthey can no more cure\r\ntheir own souls than they can cure their own bodies, or manage their\r\nown law affairs. In these two last cases they see the folly of meddling\r\nwith their own cases clearly enough, and go to a professional adviser\r\nas a matter of course; surely a man\xe2\x80\x99s soul is at once a more difficult\r\nand intricate matter to treat, and at the same time it is more\r\nimportant to him that it should be treated rightly than that either his\r\nbody or his money should be so. What are we to think of the practice of\r\na Church which encourages people to rely on unprofessional advice in\r\nmatters affecting their eternal welfare, when they would not think of\r\njeopardising their worldly affairs by such insane conduct?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest could see no weak place in this. These ideas had crossed his own\r\nmind vaguely before now, but he had never laid hold of them or set them\r\nin an orderly manner before himself. Nor was he quick at detecting\r\nfalse analogies and the misuse of metaphors; in fact he was a mere\r\nchild in the hands of his fellow curate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Pryer, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes all this point to? Firstly, to the\r\nduty of confession\xe2\x80\x94the outcry against which is absurd as an outcry\r\nwould be against dissection as part of the training of medical\r\nstudents. Granted these young men must see and do a great deal we do\r\nnot ourselves like even to think of, but they should adopt some other\r\nprofession unless they are prepared for this; they may even get\r\ninoculated with poison from a dead body and lose their lives, but they\r\nmust stand their chance. So if we aspire to be priests in deed as well\r\nas name, we must familiarise ourselves with the minutest and most\r\nrepulsive details of all kinds of sin, so that we may recognise it in\r\nall its stages. Some of us must doubtlessly perish spiritually in such\r\ninvestigations. We cannot help it; all science must have its martyrs,\r\nand none of these will deserve better of humanity than those who have\r\nfallen in the pursuit of spiritual pathology.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest grew more and more interested, but in the meekness of his soul\r\nsaid nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not desire this martyrdom for myself,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the other, \xe2\x80\x9con\r\nthe contrary I will avoid it to the very utmost of my power, but if it\r\nbe God\xe2\x80\x99s will that I should fall while studying what I believe most\r\ncalculated to advance his glory\xe2\x80\x94then, I say, not my will, oh Lord, but\r\nthine be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was too much even for Ernest. \xe2\x80\x9cI heard of an Irish-woman once,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cwho said she was a martyr to the drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so she was,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Pryer with warmth; and he went on to show\r\nthat this good woman was an experimentalist whose experiment, though\r\ndisastrous in its effects upon herself, was pregnant with instruction\r\nto other people. She was thus a true martyr or witness to the frightful\r\nconsequences of intemperance, to the saving, doubtless, of many who but\r\nfor her martyrdom would have taken to drinking. She was one of a\r\nforlorn hope whose failure to take a certain position went to the\r\nproving it to be impregnable and therefore to the abandonment of all\r\nattempt to take it. This was almost as great a gain to mankind as the\r\nactual taking of the position would have been.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d he added more hurriedly, \xe2\x80\x9cthe limits of vice and virtue are\r\nwretchedly ill-defined. Half the vices which the world condemns most\r\nloudly have seeds of good in them and require moderate use rather than\r\ntotal abstinence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest asked timidly for an instance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pryer, \xe2\x80\x9cI will give you no instance, but I will give you\r\na formula that shall embrace all instances. It is this, that no\r\npractice is entirely vicious which has not been extinguished among the\r\ncomeliest, most vigorous, and most cultivated races of mankind in spite\r\nof centuries of endeavour to extirpate it. If a vice in spite of such\r\nefforts can still hold its own among the most polished nations, it must\r\nbe founded on some immutable truth or fact in human nature, and must\r\nhave some compensatory advantage which we cannot afford altogether to\r\ndispense with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ernest timidly, \xe2\x80\x9cis not this virtually doing away with all\r\ndistinction between right and wrong, and leaving people without any\r\nmoral guide whatever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the people,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer: \xe2\x80\x9cit must be our care to be guides to\r\nthese, for they are and always will be incapable of guiding themselves\r\nsufficiently. We should tell them what they must do, and in an ideal\r\nstate of things should be able to enforce their doing it: perhaps when\r\nwe are better instructed the ideal state may come about; nothing will\r\nso advance it as greater knowledge of spiritual pathology on our own\r\npart. For this, three things are necessary; firstly, absolute freedom\r\nin experiment for us the clergy; secondly, absolute knowledge of what\r\nthe laity think and do, and of what thoughts and actions result in what\r\nspiritual conditions; and thirdly, a compacter organisation among\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we are to do any good we must be a closely united body, and must be\r\nsharply divided from the laity. Also we must be free from those ties\r\nwhich a wife and children involve. I can hardly express the horror with\r\nwhich I am filled by seeing English priests living in what I can only\r\ndesignate as \xe2\x80\x98open matrimony.\xe2\x80\x99 It is deplorable. The priest must be\r\nabsolutely sexless\xe2\x80\x94if not in practice, yet at any rate in theory,\r\nabsolutely\xe2\x80\x94and that too, by a theory so universally accepted that none\r\nshall venture to dispute it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ernest, \xe2\x80\x9chas not the Bible already told people what they\r\nought and ought not to do, and is it not enough for us to insist on\r\nwhat can be found here, and let the rest alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you begin with the Bible,\xe2\x80\x9d was the rejoinder, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are three parts\r\ngone on the road to infidelity, and will go the other part before you\r\nknow where you are. The Bible is not without its value to us the\r\nclergy, but for the laity it is a stumbling-block which cannot be taken\r\nout of their way too soon or too completely. Of course, I mean on the\r\nsupposition that they read it, which, happily, they seldom do. If\r\npeople read the Bible as the ordinary British churchman or churchwoman\r\nreads it, it is harmless enough; but if they read it with any\r\ncare\xe2\x80\x94which we should assume they will if we give it them at all\xe2\x80\x94it is\r\nfatal to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ernest, more and more astonished, but more and\r\nmore feeling that he was at least in the hands of a man who had\r\ndefinite ideas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour question shows me that you have never read your Bible. A more\r\nunreliable book was never put upon paper. Take my advice and don\xe2\x80\x99t read\r\nit, not till you are a few years older, and may do so safely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely you believe the Bible when it tells you of such things as\r\nthat Christ died and rose from the dead? Surely you believe this?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nErnest, quite prepared to be told that Pryer believed nothing of the\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not believe it, I know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how\xe2\x80\x94if the testimony of the Bible fails?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn that of the living voice of the Church, which I know to be\r\ninfallible and to be informed of Christ himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing conversation and others like it made a deep impression\r\nupon my hero. If next day he had taken a walk with Mr Hawke, and heard\r\nwhat he had to say on the other side, he would have been just as much\r\nstruck, and as ready to fling off what Pryer had told him, as he now\r\nwas to throw aside all he had ever heard from anyone except Pryer; but\r\nthere was no Mr Hawke at hand, so Pryer had everything his own way.\r\n\r\nEmbryo minds, like embryo bodies, pass through a number of strange\r\nmetamorphoses before they adopt their final shape. It is no more to be\r\nwondered at that one who is going to turn out a Roman Catholic, should\r\nhave passed through the stages of being first a Methodist, and then a\r\nfree thinker, than that a man should at some former time have been a\r\nmere cell, and later on an invertebrate animal. Ernest, however, could\r\nnot be expected to know this; embryos never do. Embryos think with each\r\nstage of their development that they have now reached the only\r\ncondition which really suits them. This, they say, must certainly be\r\ntheir last, inasmuch as its close will be so great a shock that nothing\r\ncan survive it. Every change is a shock; every shock is a _pro tanto_\r\ndeath. What we call death is only a shock great enough to destroy our\r\npower to recognise a past and a present as resembling one another. It\r\nis the making us consider the points of difference between our present\r\nand our past greater than the points of resemblance, so that we can no\r\nlonger call the former of these two in any proper sense a continuation\r\nof the second, but find it less trouble to think of it as something\r\nthat we choose to call new.\r\n\r\nBut, to let this pass, it was clear that spiritual pathology (I confess\r\nthat I do not know myself what spiritual pathology means\xe2\x80\x94but Pryer and\r\nErnest doubtless did) was the great desideratum of the age. It seemed\r\nto Ernest that he had made this discovery himself and been familiar\r\nwith it all his life, that he had never known, in fact, of anything\r\nelse. He wrote long letters to his college friends expounding his views\r\nas though he had been one of the Apostolic fathers. As for the Old\r\nTestament writers, he had no patience with them. \xe2\x80\x9cDo oblige me,\xe2\x80\x9d I find\r\nhim writing to one friend, \xe2\x80\x9cby reading the prophet Zechariah, and\r\ngiving me your candid opinion upon him. He is poor stuff, full of\r\nYankee bounce; it is sickening to live in an age when such balderdash\r\ncan be gravely admired whether as poetry or prophecy.\xe2\x80\x9d This was because\r\nPryer had set him against Zechariah. I do not know what Zechariah had\r\ndone; I should think myself that Zechariah was a very good prophet;\r\nperhaps it was because he was a Bible writer, and not a very prominent\r\none, that Pryer selected him as one through whom to disparage the Bible\r\nin comparison with the Church.\r\n\r\nTo his friend Dawson I find him saying a little later on: \xe2\x80\x9cPryer and I\r\ncontinue our walks, working out each other\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts. At first he used\r\nto do all the thinking, but I think I am pretty well abreast of him\r\nnow, and rather chuckle at seeing that he is already beginning to\r\nmodify some of the views he held most strongly when I first knew him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I think he was on the high road to Rome; now, however, he seems\r\nto be a good deal struck with a suggestion of mine in which you, too,\r\nperhaps may be interested. You see we must infuse new life into the\r\nChurch somehow; we are not holding our own against either Rome or\r\ninfidelity.\xe2\x80\x9d (I may say in passing that I do not believe Ernest had as\r\nyet ever seen an infidel\xe2\x80\x94not to speak to.) \xe2\x80\x9cI proposed, therefore, a\r\nfew days back to Pryer\xe2\x80\x94and he fell in eagerly with the proposal as soon\r\nas he saw that I had the means of carrying it out\xe2\x80\x94that we should set on\r\nfoot a spiritual movement somewhat analogous to the Young England\r\nmovement of twenty years ago, the aim of which shall be at once to\r\noutbid Rome on the one hand, and scepticism on the other. For this\r\npurpose I see nothing better than the foundation of an institution or\r\ncollege for placing the nature and treatment of sin on a more\r\nscientific basis than it rests at present. We want\xe2\x80\x94to borrow a useful\r\nterm of Pryer\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94a College of Spiritual Pathology where young men\xe2\x80\x9d (I\r\nsuppose Ernest thought he was no longer young by this time) \xe2\x80\x9cmay study\r\nthe nature and treatment of the sins of the soul as medical students\r\nstudy those of the bodies of their patients. Such a college, as you\r\nwill probably admit, will approach both Rome on the one hand, and\r\nscience on the other\xe2\x80\x94Rome, as giving the priesthood more skill, and\r\ntherefore as paving the way for their obtaining greater power, and\r\nscience, by recognising that even free thought has a certain kind of\r\nvalue in spiritual enquiries. To this purpose Pryer and I have resolved\r\nto devote ourselves henceforth heart and soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, my ideas are still unshaped, and all will depend upon the\r\nmen by whom the college is first worked. I am not yet a priest, but\r\nPryer is, and if I were to start the College, Pryer might take charge\r\nof it for a time and I work under him nominally as his subordinate.\r\nPryer himself suggested this. Is it not generous of him?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe worst of it is that we have not enough money; I have, it is true,\r\n\xc2\xa35000, but we want at least \xc2\xa310,000, so Pryer says, before we can\r\nstart; when we are fairly under weigh I might live at the college and\r\ndraw a salary from the foundation, so that it is all one, or nearly so,\r\nwhether I invest my money in this way or in buying a living; besides I\r\nwant very little; it is certain that I shall never marry; no clergyman\r\nshould think of this, and an unmarried man can live on next to nothing.\r\nStill I do not see my way to as much money as I want, and Pryer\r\nsuggests that as we can hardly earn more now we must get it by a\r\njudicious series of investments. Pryer knows several people who make\r\nquite a handsome income out of very little or, indeed, I may say,\r\nnothing at all, by buying things at a place they call the Stock\r\nExchange; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about it yet, but Pryer says I should soon\r\nlearn; he thinks, indeed, that I have shown rather a talent in this\r\ndirection, and under proper auspices should make a very good man of\r\nbusiness. Others, of course, and not I, must decide this; but a man can\r\ndo anything if he gives his mind to it, and though I should not care\r\nabout having more money for my own sake, I care about it very much when\r\nI think of the good I could do with it by saving souls from such\r\nhorrible torture hereafter. Why, if the thing succeeds, and I really\r\ncannot see what is to hinder it, it is hardly possible to exaggerate\r\nits importance, nor the proportions which it may ultimately assume,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\netc., etc.\r\n\r\nAgain I asked Ernest whether he minded my printing this. He winced, but\r\nsaid \xe2\x80\x9cNo, not if it helps you to tell your story: but don\xe2\x80\x99t you think\r\nit is too long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said it would let the reader see for himself how things were going in\r\nhalf the time that it would take me to explain them to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well then, keep it by all means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI continue turning over my file of Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s letters and find as\r\nfollows\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks for your last, in answer to which I send you a rough copy of a\r\nletter I sent to the _Times_ a day or two back. They did not insert it,\r\nbut it embodies pretty fully my ideas on the parochial visitation\r\nquestion, and Pryer fully approves of the letter. Think it carefully\r\nover and send it back to me when read, for it is so exactly my present\r\ncreed that I cannot afford to lose it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should very much like to have a _viva voce_ discussion on these\r\nmatters: I can only see for certain that we have suffered a dreadful\r\nloss in being no longer able to excommunicate. We should excommunicate\r\nrich and poor alike, and pretty freely too. If this power were restored\r\nto us we could, I think, soon put a stop to by far the greater part of\r\nthe sin and misery with which we are surrounded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese letters were written only a few weeks after Ernest had been\r\nordained, but they are nothing to others that he wrote a little later\r\non.\r\n\r\nIn his eagerness to regenerate the Church of England (and through this\r\nthe universe) by the means which Pryer had suggested to him, it\r\noccurred to him to try to familiarise himself with the habits and\r\nthoughts of the poor by going and living among them. I think he got\r\nthis notion from Kingsley\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cAlton Locke,\xe2\x80\x9d which, High Churchman though\r\nhe for the nonce was, he had devoured as he had devoured Stanley\xe2\x80\x99s Life\r\nof Arnold, Dickens\xe2\x80\x99s novels, and whatever other literary garbage of the\r\nday was most likely to do him harm; at any rate he actually put his\r\nscheme into practice, and took lodgings in Ashpit Place, a small street\r\nin the neighbourhood of Drury Lane Theatre, in a house of which the\r\nlandlady was the widow of a cabman.\r\n\r\nThis lady occupied the whole ground floor. In the front kitchen there\r\nwas a tinker. The back kitchen was let to a bellows-mender. On the\r\nfirst floor came Ernest, with his two rooms which he furnished\r\ncomfortably, for one must draw the line somewhere. The two upper floors\r\nwere parcelled out among four different sets of lodgers: there was a\r\ntailor named Holt, a drunken fellow who used to beat his wife at night\r\ntill her screams woke the house; above him there was another tailor\r\nwith a wife but no children; these people were Wesleyans, given to\r\ndrink but not noisy. The two back rooms were held by single ladies, who\r\nit seemed to Ernest must be respectably connected, for well-dressed\r\ngentlemanly-looking young men used to go up and down stairs past\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x99s rooms to call at any rate on Miss Snow\xe2\x80\x94Ernest had heard her\r\ndoor slam after they had passed. He thought, too, that some of them\r\nwent up to Miss Maitland\xe2\x80\x99s. Mrs Jupp, the landlady, told Ernest that\r\nthese were brothers and cousins of Miss Snow\xe2\x80\x99s, and that she was\r\nherself looking out for a situation as a governess, but at present had\r\nan engagement as an actress at the Drury Lane Theatre. Ernest asked\r\nwhether Miss Maitland in the top back was also looking out for a\r\nsituation, and was told she was wanting an engagement as a milliner. He\r\nbelieved whatever Mrs Jupp told him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThis move on Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s part was variously commented upon by his friends,\r\nthe general opinion being that it was just like Pontifex, who was sure\r\nto do something unusual wherever he went, but that on the whole the\r\nidea was commendable. Christina could not restrain herself when on\r\nsounding her clerical neighbours she found them inclined to applaud her\r\nson for conduct which they idealised into something much more\r\nself-denying than it really was. She did not quite like his living in\r\nsuch an unaristocratic neighbourhood; but what he was doing would\r\nprobably get into the newspapers, and then great people would take\r\nnotice of him. Besides, it would be very cheap; down among these poor\r\npeople he could live for next to nothing, and might put by a great deal\r\nof his income. As for temptations, there could be few or none in such a\r\nplace as that. This argument about cheapness was the one with which she\r\nmost successfully met Theobald, who grumbled more _suo_ that he had no\r\nsympathy with his son\xe2\x80\x99s extravagance and conceit. When Christina\r\npointed out to him that it would be cheap he replied that there was\r\nsomething in that.\r\n\r\nOn Ernest himself the effect was to confirm the good opinion of himself\r\nwhich had been growing upon him ever since he had begun to read for\r\norders, and to make him flatter himself that he was among the few who\r\nwere ready to give up _all_ for Christ. Ere long he began to conceive\r\nof himself as a man with a mission and a great future. His lightest and\r\nmost hastily formed opinions began to be of momentous importance to\r\nhim, and he inflicted them, as I have already shown, on his old\r\nfriends, week by week becoming more and more _ent\xc3\xaat\xc3\xa9_ with himself and\r\nhis own crotchets. I should like well enough to draw a veil over this\r\npart of my hero\xe2\x80\x99s career, but cannot do so without marring my story.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1859 I find him writing\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot call the visible Church Christian till its fruits are\r\nChristian, that is until the fruits of the members of the Church of\r\nEngland are in conformity, or something like conformity, with her\r\nteaching. I cordially agree with the teaching of the Church of England\r\nin most respects, but she says one thing and does another, and until\r\nexcommunication\xe2\x80\x94yes, and wholesale excommunication\xe2\x80\x94be resorted to, I\r\ncannot call her a Christian institution. I should begin with our\r\nRector, and if I found it necessary to follow him up by excommunicating\r\nthe Bishop, I should not flinch even from this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe present London Rectors are hopeless people to deal with. My own is\r\none of the best of them, but the moment Pryer and I show signs of\r\nwanting to attack an evil in a way not recognised by routine, or of\r\nremedying anything about which no outcry has been made, we are met\r\nwith, \xe2\x80\x98I cannot think what you mean by all this disturbance; nobody\r\nelse among the clergy sees these things, and I have no wish to be the\r\nfirst to begin turning everything topsy-turvy.\xe2\x80\x99 And then people call\r\nhim a sensible man. I have no patience with them. However, we know what\r\nwe want, and, as I wrote to Dawson the other day, have a scheme on foot\r\nwhich will, I think, fairly meet the requirements of the case. But we\r\nwant more money, and my first move towards getting this has not turned\r\nout quite so satisfactorily as Pryer and I had hoped; we shall,\r\nhowever, I doubt not, retrieve it shortly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Ernest came to London he intended doing a good deal of\r\nhouse-to-house visiting, but Pryer had talked him out of this even\r\nbefore he settled down in his new and strangely-chosen apartments. The\r\nline he now took was that if people wanted Christ, they must prove\r\ntheir want by taking some little trouble, and the trouble required of\r\nthem was that they should come and seek him, Ernest, out; there he was\r\nin the midst of them ready to teach; if people did not choose to come\r\nto him it was no fault of his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy great business here,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes again to Dawson, \xe2\x80\x9cis to observe. I\r\nam not doing much in parish work beyond my share of the daily services.\r\nI have a man\xe2\x80\x99s Bible Class, and a boy\xe2\x80\x99s Bible Class, and a good many\r\nyoung men and boys to whom I give instruction one way or another; then\r\nthere are the Sunday School children, with whom I fill my room on a\r\nSunday evening as full as it will hold, and let them sing hymns and\r\nchants. They like this. I do a great deal of reading\xe2\x80\x94chiefly of books\r\nwhich Pryer and I think most likely to help; we find nothing comparable\r\nto the Jesuits. Pryer is a thorough gentleman, and an admirable man of\r\nbusiness\xe2\x80\x94no less observant of the things of this world, in fact, than\r\nof the things above; by a brilliant coup he has retrieved, or nearly\r\nso, a rather serious loss which threatened to delay indefinitely the\r\nexecution of our great scheme. He and I daily gather fresh principles.\r\nI believe great things are before me, and am strong in the hope of\r\nbeing able by and by to effect much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for you I bid you God speed. Be bold but logical, speculative but\r\ncautious, daringly courageous, but properly circumspect withal,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nI think this may do for the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV\r\n\r\n\r\nI had called on Ernest as a matter of course when he first came to\r\nLondon, but had not seen him. I had been out when he returned my call,\r\nso that he had been in town for some weeks before I actually saw him,\r\nwhich I did not very long after he had taken possession of his new\r\nrooms. I liked his face, but except for the common bond of music, in\r\nrespect of which our tastes were singularly alike, I should hardly have\r\nknown how to get on with him. To do him justice he did not air any of\r\nhis schemes to me until I had drawn him out concerning them. I, to\r\nborrow the words of Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s landlady, Mrs Jupp, \xe2\x80\x9cam not a very regular\r\nchurch-goer\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94I discovered upon cross-examination that Mrs Jupp had been\r\nto church once when she was churched for her son Tom some five and\r\ntwenty years since, but never either before or afterwards; not even, I\r\nfear, to be married, for though she called herself \xe2\x80\x9cMrs\xe2\x80\x9d she wore no\r\nwedding ring, and spoke of the person who should have been Mr Jupp as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmy poor dear boy\xe2\x80\x99s father,\xe2\x80\x9d not as \xe2\x80\x9cmy husband.\xe2\x80\x9d But to return. I was\r\nvexed at Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s having been ordained. I was not ordained myself and I\r\ndid not like my friends to be ordained, nor did I like having to be on\r\nmy best behaviour and to look as if butter would not melt in my mouth,\r\nand all for a boy whom I remembered when he knew yesterday and\r\nto-morrow and Tuesday, but not a day of the week more\xe2\x80\x94not even Sunday\r\nitself\xe2\x80\x94and when he said he did not like the kitten because it had pins\r\nin its toes.\r\n\r\nI looked at him and thought of his aunt Alethea, and how fast the money\r\nshe had left him was accumulating; and it was all to go to this young\r\nman, who would use it probably in the very last ways with which Miss\r\nPontifex would have sympathised. I was annoyed. \xe2\x80\x9cShe always said,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nthought to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she should make a mess of it, but I did not\r\nthink she would have made as great a mess of it as this.\xe2\x80\x9d Then I\r\nthought that perhaps if his aunt had lived he would not have been like\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nErnest behaved quite nicely to me and I own that the fault was mine if\r\nthe conversation drew towards dangerous subjects. I was the aggressor,\r\npresuming I suppose upon my age and long acquaintance with him, as\r\ngiving me a right to make myself unpleasant in a quiet way.\r\n\r\nThen he came out, and the exasperating part of it was that up to a\r\ncertain point he was so very right. Grant him his premises and his\r\nconclusions were sound enough, nor could I, seeing that he was already\r\nordained, join issue with him about his premises as I should certainly\r\nhave done if I had had a chance of doing so before he had taken orders.\r\nThe result was that I had to beat a retreat and went away not in the\r\nbest of humours. I believe the truth was that I liked Ernest, and was\r\nvexed at his being a clergyman, and at a clergyman having so much money\r\ncoming to him.\r\n\r\nI talked a little with Mrs Jupp on my way out. She and I had reckoned\r\none another up at first sight as being neither of us \xe2\x80\x9cvery regular\r\nchurch-goers,\xe2\x80\x9d and the strings of her tongue had been loosened. She\r\nsaid Ernest would die. He was much too good for the world and he looked\r\nso sad \xe2\x80\x9cjust like young Watkins of the \xe2\x80\x98Crown\xe2\x80\x99 over the way who died a\r\nmonth ago, and his poor dear skin was white as alablaster; least-ways\r\nthey say he shot hisself. They took him from the Mortimer, I met them\r\njust as I was going with my Rose to get a pint o\xe2\x80\x99 four ale, and she had\r\nher arm in splints. She told her sister she wanted to go to Perry\xe2\x80\x99s to\r\nget some wool, instead o\xe2\x80\x99 which it was only a stall to get me a pint o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nale, bless her heart; there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody else would do that much for poor\r\nold Jupp, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a horrid lie to say she is gay; not but what I like\r\na gay woman, I do: I\xe2\x80\x99d rather give a gay woman half-a-crown than stand\r\na modest woman a pot o\xe2\x80\x99 beer, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go associating with\r\nbad girls for all that. So they took him from the Mortimer; they\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let him go home no more; and he done it that artful you know.\r\nHis wife was in the country living with her mother, and she always\r\nspoke respectful o\xe2\x80\x99 my Rose. Poor dear, I hope his soul is in Heaven.\r\nWell Sir, would you believe it, there\xe2\x80\x99s that in Mr Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nwhich is just like young Watkins; he looks that worrited and scrunched\r\nup at times, but it\xe2\x80\x99s never for the same reason, for he don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nnothing at all, no more than a unborn babe, no he don\xe2\x80\x99t; why there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot a monkey going about London with an Italian organ grinder but knows\r\nmore than Mr Pontifex do. He don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94well I suppose\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere a child came in on an errand from some neighbour and interrupted\r\nher, or I can form no idea where or when she would have ended her\r\ndiscourse. I seized the opportunity to run away, but not before I had\r\ngiven her five shillings and made her write down my address, for I was\r\na little frightened by what she said. I told her if she thought her\r\nlodger grew worse, she was to come and let me know.\r\n\r\nWeeks went by and I did not see her again. Having done as much as I\r\nhad, I felt absolved from doing more, and let Ernest alone as thinking\r\nthat he and I should only bore one another.\r\n\r\nHe had now been ordained a little over four months, but these months\r\nhad not brought happiness or satisfaction with them. He had lived in a\r\nclergyman\xe2\x80\x99s house all his life, and might have been expected perhaps to\r\nhave known pretty much what being a clergyman was like, and so he did\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ncountry clergyman; he had formed an ideal, however, as regards what a\r\ntown clergyman could do, and was trying in a feeble tentative way to\r\nrealise it, but somehow or other it always managed to escape him.\r\n\r\nHe lived among the poor, but he did not find that he got to know them.\r\nThe idea that they would come to him proved to be a mistaken one. He\r\ndid indeed visit a few tame pets whom his rector desired him to look\r\nafter. There was an old man and his wife who lived next door but one to\r\nErnest himself; then there was a plumber of the name of Chesterfield;\r\nan aged lady of the name of Gover, blind and bed-ridden, who munched\r\nand munched her feeble old toothless jaws as Ernest spoke or read to\r\nher, but who could do little more; a Mr Brookes, a rag and bottle\r\nmerchant in Birdsey\xe2\x80\x99s Rents in the last stage of dropsy, and perhaps\r\nhalf a dozen or so others. What did it all come to, when he did go to\r\nsee them? The plumber wanted to be flattered, and liked fooling a\r\ngentleman into wasting his time by scratching his ears for him. Mrs\r\nGover, poor old woman, wanted money; she was very good and meek, and\r\nwhen Ernest got her a shilling from Lady Anne Jones\xe2\x80\x99s bequest, she said\r\nit was \xe2\x80\x9csmall but seasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d and munched and munched in gratitude.\r\nErnest sometimes gave her a little money himself, but not, as he says\r\nnow, half what he ought to have given.\r\n\r\nWhat could he do else that would have been of the smallest use to her?\r\nNothing indeed; but giving occasional half-crowns to Mrs Gover was not\r\nregenerating the universe, and Ernest wanted nothing short of this. The\r\nworld was all out of joint, and instead of feeling it to be a cursed\r\nspite that he was born to set it right, he thought he was just the kind\r\nof person that was wanted for the job, and was eager to set to work,\r\nonly he did not exactly know how to begin, for the beginning he had\r\nmade with Mr Chesterfield and Mrs Gover did not promise great\r\ndevelopments.\r\n\r\nThen poor Mr Brookes\xe2\x80\x94he suffered very much, terribly indeed; he was not\r\nin want of money; he wanted to die and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, just as we sometimes\r\nwant to go to sleep and cannot. He had been a serious-minded man, and\r\ndeath frightened him as it must frighten anyone who believes that all\r\nhis most secret thoughts will be shortly exposed in public. When I read\r\nErnest the description of how his father used to visit Mrs Thompson at\r\nBattersby, he coloured and said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s just what I used to say to Mr\r\nBrookes.\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest felt that his visits, so far from comforting Mr\r\nBrookes, made him fear death more and more, but how could he help it?\r\n\r\nEven Pryer, who had been curate a couple of years, did not know\r\npersonally more than a couple of hundred people in the parish at the\r\noutside, and it was only at the houses of very few of these that he\r\never visited, but then Pryer had such a strong objection on principle\r\nto house visitations. What a drop in the sea were those with whom he\r\nand Pryer were brought into direct communication in comparison with\r\nthose whom he must reach and move if he were to produce much effect of\r\nany kind, one way or the other. Why there were between fifteen and\r\ntwenty thousand poor in the parish, of whom but the merest fraction\r\never attended a place of worship. Some few went to dissenting chapels,\r\na few were Roman Catholics; by far the greater number, however, were\r\npractically infidels, if not actively hostile, at any rate indifferent\r\nto religion, while many were avowed Atheists\xe2\x80\x94admirers of Tom Paine, of\r\nwhom he now heard for the first time; but he never met and conversed\r\nwith any of these.\r\n\r\nWas he really doing everything that could be expected of him? It was\r\nall very well to say that he was doing as much as other young clergymen\r\ndid; that was not the kind of answer which Jesus Christ was likely to\r\naccept; why, the Pharisees themselves in all probability did as much as\r\nthe other Pharisees did. What he should do was to go into the highways\r\nand byways, and compel people to come in. Was he doing this?  Or were\r\nnot they rather compelling him to keep out\xe2\x80\x94outside their doors at any\r\nrate? He began to have an uneasy feeling as though ere long, unless he\r\nkept a sharp look out, he should drift into being a sham.\r\n\r\nTrue, all would be changed as soon as he could endow the College for\r\nSpiritual Pathology; matters, however, had not gone too well with \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nthings that people bought in the place that was called the Stock\r\nExchange.\xe2\x80\x9d In order to get on faster, it had been arranged that Ernest\r\nshould buy more of these things than he could pay for, with the idea\r\nthat in a few weeks, or even days, they would be much higher in value,\r\nand he could sell them at a tremendous profit; but, unfortunately,\r\ninstead of getting higher, they had fallen immediately after Ernest had\r\nbought, and obstinately refused to get up again; so, after a few\r\nsettlements, he had got frightened, for he read an article in some\r\nnewspaper, which said they would go ever so much lower, and, contrary\r\nto Pryer\xe2\x80\x99s advice, he insisted on selling\xe2\x80\x94at a loss of something like\r\n\xc2\xa3500. He had hardly sold when up went the shares again, and he saw how\r\nfoolish he had been, and how wise Pryer was, for if Pryer\xe2\x80\x99s advice had\r\nbeen followed, he would have made \xc2\xa3500, instead of losing it. However,\r\nhe told himself he must live and learn.\r\n\r\nThen Pryer made a mistake. They had bought some shares, and the shares\r\nwent up delightfully for about a fortnight. This was a happy time\r\nindeed, for by the end of a fortnight, the lost \xc2\xa3500 had been\r\nrecovered, and three or four hundred pounds had been cleared into the\r\nbargain. All the feverish anxiety of that miserable six weeks, when the\r\n\xc2\xa3500 was being lost, was now being repaid with interest. Ernest wanted\r\nto sell and make sure of the profit, but Pryer would not hear of it;\r\nthey would go ever so much higher yet, and he showed Ernest an article\r\nin some newspaper which proved that what he said was reasonable, and\r\nthey did go up a little\xe2\x80\x94but only a very little, for then they went\r\ndown, down, and Ernest saw first his clear profit of three or four\r\nhundred pounds go, and then the \xc2\xa3500 loss, which he thought he had\r\nrecovered, slipped away by falls of a half and one at a time, and then\r\nhe lost \xc2\xa3200 more. Then a newspaper said that these shares were the\r\ngreatest rubbish that had ever been imposed upon the English public,\r\nand Ernest could stand it no longer, so he sold out, again this time\r\nagainst Pryer\xe2\x80\x99s advice, so that when they went up, as they shortly did,\r\nPryer scored off Ernest a second time.\r\n\r\nErnest was not used to vicissitudes of this kind, and they made him so\r\nanxious that his health was affected. It was arranged therefore that he\r\nhad better know nothing of what was being done. Pryer was a much better\r\nman of business than he was, and would see to it all. This relieved\r\nErnest of a good deal of trouble, and was better after all for the\r\ninvestments themselves; for, as Pryer justly said, a man must not have\r\na faint heart if he hopes to succeed in buying and selling upon the\r\nStock Exchange, and seeing Ernest nervous made Pryer nervous too\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nleast, he said it did. So the money drifted more and more into Pryer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands. As for Pryer himself, he had nothing but his curacy and a small\r\nallowance from his father.\r\n\r\nSome of Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s old friends got an inkling from his letters of what he\r\nwas doing, and did their utmost to dissuade him, but he was as\r\ninfatuated as a young lover of two and twenty. Finding that these\r\nfriends disapproved, he dropped away from them, and they, being bored\r\nwith his egotism and high-flown ideas, were not sorry to let him do so.\r\nOf course, he said nothing about his speculations\xe2\x80\x94indeed, he hardly\r\nknew that anything done in so good a cause could be called speculation.\r\nAt Battersby, when his father urged him to look out for a next\r\npresentation, and even brought one or two promising ones under his\r\nnotice, he made objections and excuses, though always promising to do\r\nas his father desired very shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI\r\n\r\n\r\nBy and by a subtle, indefinable _malaise_ began to take possession of\r\nhim. I once saw a very young foal trying to eat some most objectionable\r\nrefuse, and unable to make up its mind whether it was good or no.\r\nClearly it wanted to be told. If its mother had seen what it was doing\r\nshe would have set it right in a moment, and as soon as ever it had\r\nbeen told that what it was eating was filth, the foal would have\r\nrecognised it and never have wanted to be told again; but the foal\r\ncould not settle the matter for itself, or make up its mind whether it\r\nliked what it was trying to eat or no, without assistance from without.\r\nI suppose it would have come to do so by and by, but it was wasting\r\ntime and trouble, which a single look from its mother would have saved,\r\njust as wort will in time ferment of itself, but will ferment much more\r\nquickly if a little yeast be added to it. In the matter of knowing what\r\ngives us pleasure we are all like wort, and if unaided from without can\r\nonly ferment slowly and toilsomely.\r\n\r\nMy unhappy hero about this time was very much like the foal, or rather\r\nhe felt much what the foal would have felt if its mother and all the\r\nother grown-up horses in the field had vowed that what it was eating\r\nwas the most excellent and nutritious food to be found anywhere. He was\r\nso anxious to do what was right, and so ready to believe that every one\r\nknew better than himself, that he never ventured to admit to himself\r\nthat he might be all the while on a hopelessly wrong tack. It did not\r\noccur to him that there might be a blunder anywhere, much less did it\r\noccur to him to try and find out where the blunder was. Nevertheless he\r\nbecame daily more full of _malaise_, and daily, only he knew it not,\r\nmore ripe for an explosion should a spark fall upon him.\r\n\r\nOne thing, however, did begin to loom out of the general vagueness, and\r\nto this he instinctively turned as trying to seize it\xe2\x80\x94I mean, the fact\r\nthat he was saving very few souls, whereas there were thousands and\r\nthousands being lost hourly all around him which a little energy such\r\nas Mr Hawke\xe2\x80\x99s might save. Day after day went by, and what was he doing?\r\nStanding on professional _etiquette_, and praying that his shares might\r\ngo up and down as he wanted them, so that they might give him money\r\nenough to enable him to regenerate the universe. But in the meantime\r\nthe people were dying. How many souls would not be doomed to endless\r\nages of the most frightful torments that the mind could think of,\r\nbefore he could bring his spiritual pathology engine to bear upon them?\r\nWhy might he not stand and preach as he saw the Dissenters doing\r\nsometimes in Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn Fields and other thoroughfares? He could say\r\nall that Mr Hawke had said. Mr Hawke was a very poor creature in\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x99s eyes now, for he was a Low Churchman, but we should not be\r\nabove learning from any one, and surely he could affect his hearers as\r\npowerfully as Mr Hawke had affected him if he only had the courage to\r\nset to work. The people whom he saw preaching in the squares sometimes\r\ndrew large audiences. He could at any rate preach better than they.\r\n\r\nErnest broached this to Pryer, who treated it as something too\r\noutrageous to be even thought of. Nothing, he said, could more tend to\r\nlower the dignity of the clergy and bring the Church into contempt. His\r\nmanner was brusque, and even rude.\r\n\r\nErnest ventured a little mild dissent; he admitted it was not usual,\r\nbut something at any rate must be done, and that quickly. This was how\r\nWesley and Whitfield had begun that great movement which had kindled\r\nreligious life in the minds of hundreds of thousands. This was no time\r\nto be standing on dignity. It was just because Wesley and Whitfield had\r\ndone what the Church would not that they had won men to follow them\r\nwhom the Church had now lost.\r\n\r\nPryer eyed Ernest searchingly, and after a pause said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat to make of you, Pontifex; you are at once so very right and so\r\nvery wrong. I agree with you heartily that something should be done,\r\nbut it must not be done in a way which experience has shown leads to\r\nnothing but fanaticism and dissent. Do you approve of these Wesleyans?\r\nDo you hold your ordination vows so cheaply as to think that it does\r\nnot matter whether the services of the Church are performed in her\r\nchurches and with all due ceremony or not? If you do\xe2\x80\x94then, frankly, you\r\nhad no business to be ordained; if you do not, then remember that one\r\nof the first duties of a young deacon is obedience to authority.\r\nNeither the Catholic Church, nor yet the Church of England allows her\r\nclergy to preach in the streets of cities where there is no lack of\r\nchurches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest felt the force of this, and Pryer saw that he wavered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are living,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued more genially, \xe2\x80\x9cin an age of transition,\r\nand in a country which, though it has gained much by the Reformation,\r\ndoes not perceive how much it has also lost. You cannot and must not\r\nhawk Christ about in the streets as though you were in a heathen\r\ncountry whose inhabitants had never heard of him. The people here in\r\nLondon have had ample warning. Every church they pass is a protest to\r\nthem against their lives, and a call to them to repent. Every\r\nchurch-bell they hear is a witness against them, everyone of those whom\r\nthey meet on Sundays going to or coming from church is a warning voice\r\nfrom God. If these countless influences produce no effect upon them,\r\nneither will the few transient words which they would hear from you.\r\nYou are like Dives, and think that if one rose from the dead they would\r\nhear him. Perhaps they might; but then you cannot pretend that you have\r\nrisen from the dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough the last few words were spoken laughingly, there was a sub-sneer\r\nabout them which made Ernest wince; but he was quite subdued, and so\r\nthe conversation ended. It left Ernest, however, not for the first\r\ntime, consciously dissatisfied with Pryer, and inclined to set his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s opinion on one side\xe2\x80\x94not openly, but quietly, and without\r\ntelling Pryer anything about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had hardly parted from Pryer before there occurred another incident\r\nwhich strengthened his discontent. He had fallen, as I have shown,\r\namong a gang of spiritual thieves or coiners, who passed the basest\r\nmetal upon him without his finding it out, so childish and\r\ninexperienced was he in the ways of anything but those back eddies of\r\nthe world, schools and universities. Among the bad threepenny pieces\r\nwhich had been passed off upon him, and which he kept for small hourly\r\ndisbursement, was a remark that poor people were much nicer than the\r\nricher and better educated. Ernest now said that he always travelled\r\nthird class not because it was cheaper, but because the people whom he\r\nmet in third class carriages were so much pleasanter and better\r\nbehaved. As for the young men who attended Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s evening classes,\r\nthey were pronounced to be more intelligent and better ordered\r\ngenerally than the average run of Oxford and Cambridge men. Our foolish\r\nyoung friend having heard Pryer talk to this effect, caught up all he\r\nsaid and reproduced it _more suo_.\r\n\r\nOne evening, however, about this time, whom should he see coming along\r\na small street not far from his own but, of all persons in the world,\r\nTowneley, looking as full of life and good spirits as ever, and if\r\npossible even handsomer than he had been at Cambridge. Much as Ernest\r\nliked him he found himself shrinking from speaking to him, and was\r\nendeavouring to pass him without doing so when Towneley saw him and\r\nstopped him at once, being pleased to see an old Cambridge face. He\r\nseemed for the moment a little confused at being seen in such a\r\nneighbourhood, but recovered himself so soon that Ernest hardly noticed\r\nit, and then plunged into a few kindly remarks about old times. Ernest\r\nfelt that he quailed as he saw Towneley\xe2\x80\x99s eye wander to his white\r\nnecktie and saw that he was being reckoned up, and rather\r\ndisapprovingly reckoned up, as a parson. It was the merest passing\r\nshade upon Towneley\xe2\x80\x99s face, but Ernest had felt it.\r\n\r\nTowneley said a few words of common form to Ernest about his profession\r\nas being what he thought would be most likely to interest him, and\r\nErnest, still confused and shy, gave him for lack of something better\r\nto say his little threepenny-bit about poor people being so very nice.\r\nTowneley took this for what it was worth and nodded assent, whereon\r\nErnest imprudently went further and said \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you like poor people\r\nvery much yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTowneley gave his face a comical but good-natured screw, and said\r\nquietly, but slowly and decidedly, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no,\xe2\x80\x9d and escaped.\r\n\r\nIt was all over with Ernest from that moment. As usual he did not know\r\nit, but he had entered none the less upon another reaction. Towneley\r\nhad just taken Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s threepenny-bit into his hands, looked at it and\r\nreturned it to him as a bad one. Why did he see in a moment that it was\r\na bad one now, though he had been unable to see it when he had taken it\r\nfrom Pryer? Of course some poor people were very nice, and always would\r\nbe so, but as though scales had fallen suddenly from his eyes he saw\r\nthat no one was nicer for being poor, and that between the upper and\r\nlower classes there was a gulf which amounted practically to an\r\nimpassable barrier.\r\n\r\nThat evening he reflected a good deal. If Towneley was right, and\r\nErnest felt that the \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d had applied not to the remark about poor\r\npeople only, but to the whole scheme and scope of his own recently\r\nadopted ideas, he and Pryer must surely be on a wrong track. Towneley\r\nhad not argued with him; he had said one word only, and that one of the\r\nshortest in the language, but Ernest was in a fit state for\r\ninoculation, and the minute particle of virus set about working\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nWhich did he now think was most likely to have taken the juster view of\r\nlife and things, and whom would it be best to imitate, Towneley or\r\nPryer? His heart returned answer to itself without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhesitation. The faces of men like Towneley were open and kindly; they\r\nlooked as if at ease themselves, and as though they would set all who\r\nhad to do with them at ease as far as might be. The faces of Pryer and\r\nhis friends were not like this. Why had he felt tacitly rebuked as soon\r\nas he had met Towneley? Was he not a Christian? Certainly; he believed\r\nin the Church of England as a matter of course. Then how could he be\r\nhimself wrong in trying to act up to the faith that he and Towneley\r\nheld in common? He was trying to lead a quiet, unobtrusive life of\r\nself-devotion, whereas Towneley was not, so far as he could see, trying\r\nto do anything of the kind; he was only trying to get on comfortably in\r\nthe world, and to look and be as nice as possible. And he was nice, and\r\nErnest knew that such men as himself and Pryer were not nice, and his\r\nold dejection came over him.\r\n\r\nThen came an even worse reflection; how if he had fallen among material\r\nthieves as well as spiritual ones? He knew very little of how his money\r\nwas going on; he had put it all now into Pryer\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and though\r\nPryer gave him cash to spend whenever he wanted it, he seemed impatient\r\nof being questioned as to what was being done with the principal. It\r\nwas part of the understanding, he said, that that was to be left to\r\nhim, and Ernest had better stick to this, or he, Pryer, would throw up\r\nthe College of Spiritual Pathology altogether; and so Ernest was cowed\r\ninto acquiescence, or cajoled, according to the humour in which Pryer\r\nsaw him to be. Ernest thought that further questions would look as if\r\nhe doubted Pryer\xe2\x80\x99s word, and also that he had gone too far to be able\r\nto recede in decency or honour. This, however, he felt was riding out\r\nto meet trouble unnecessarily. Pryer had been a little impatient, but\r\nhe was a gentleman and an admirable man of business, so his money would\r\ndoubtless come back to him all right some day.\r\n\r\nErnest comforted himself as regards this last source of anxiety, but as\r\nregards the other, he began to feel as though, if he was to be saved, a\r\ngood Samaritan must hurry up from somewhere\xe2\x80\x94he knew not whence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day he felt stronger again. He had been listening to the voice of\r\nthe evil one on the night before, and would parley no more with such\r\nthoughts. He had chosen his profession, and his duty was to persevere\r\nwith it. If he was unhappy it was probably because he was not giving up\r\nall for Christ. Let him see whether he could not do more than he was\r\ndoing now, and then perhaps a light would be shed upon his path.\r\n\r\nIt was all very well to have made the discovery that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t very\r\nmuch like poor people, but he had got to put up with them, for it was\r\namong them that his work must lie. Such men as Towneley were very kind\r\nand considerate, but he knew well enough it was only on condition that\r\nhe did not preach to them. He could manage the poor better, and, let\r\nPryer sneer as he liked, he was resolved to go more among them, and try\r\nthe effect of bringing Christ to them if they would not come and seek\r\nChrist of themselves. He would begin with his own house.\r\n\r\nWho then should he take first? Surely he could not do better than begin\r\nwith the tailor who lived immediately over his head. This would be\r\ndesirable, not only because he was the one who seemed to stand most in\r\nneed of conversion, but also because, if he were once converted, he\r\nwould no longer beat his wife at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, and the\r\nhouse would be much pleasanter in consequence. He would therefore go\r\nupstairs at once, and have a quiet talk with this man.\r\n\r\nBefore doing so, he thought it would be well if he were to draw up\r\nsomething like a plan of a campaign; he therefore reflected over some\r\npretty conversations which would do very nicely if Mr Holt would be\r\nkind enough to make the answers proposed for him in their proper\r\nplaces. But the man was a great hulking fellow, of a savage temper, and\r\nErnest was forced to admit that unforeseen developments might arise to\r\ndisconcert him. They say it takes nine tailors to make a man, but\r\nErnest felt that it would take at least nine Ernests to make a Mr Holt.\r\nHow if, as soon as Ernest came in, the tailor were to become violent\r\nand abusive? What could he do? Mr Holt was in his own lodgings, and had\r\na right to be undisturbed. A legal right, yes, but had he a moral\r\nright? Ernest thought not, considering his mode of life. But put this\r\non one side; if the man were to be violent, what should he do? Paul had\r\nfought with wild beasts at Ephesus\xe2\x80\x94that must indeed have been awful\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nperhaps they were not very wild wild beasts; a rabbit and a canary are\r\nwild beasts; but, formidable or not as wild beasts go, they would,\r\nnevertheless stand no chance against St Paul, for he was inspired; the\r\nmiracle would have been if the wild beasts escaped, not that St Paul\r\nshould have done so; but, however all this might be, Ernest felt that\r\nhe dared not begin to convert Mr Holt by fighting him. Why, when he had\r\nheard Mrs Holt screaming \xe2\x80\x9cmurder,\xe2\x80\x9d he had cowered under the bed clothes\r\nand waited, expecting to hear the blood dripping through the ceiling on\r\nto his own floor. His imagination translated every sound into a pat,\r\npat, pat, and once or twice he thought he had felt it dropping on to\r\nhis counterpane, but he had never gone upstairs to try and rescue poor\r\nMrs Holt. Happily it had proved next morning that Mrs Holt was in her\r\nusual health.\r\n\r\nErnest was in despair about hitting on any good way of opening up\r\nspiritual communication with his neighbour, when it occurred to him\r\nthat he had better perhaps begin by going upstairs, and knocking very\r\ngently at Mr Holt\xe2\x80\x99s door. He would then resign himself to the guidance\r\nof the Holy Spirit, and act as the occasion, which, I suppose, was\r\nanother name for the Holy Spirit, suggested. Triply armed with this\r\nreflection, he mounted the stairs quite jauntily, and was about to\r\nknock when he heard Holt\xe2\x80\x99s voice inside swearing savagely at his wife.\r\nThis made him pause to think whether after all the moment was an\r\nauspicious one, and while he was thus pausing, Mr Holt, who had heard\r\nthat someone was on the stairs, opened the door and put his head out.\r\nWhen he saw Ernest, he made an unpleasant, not to say offensive\r\nmovement, which might or might not have been directed at Ernest and\r\nlooked altogether so ugly that my hero had an instantaneous and\r\nunequivocal revelation from the Holy Spirit to the effect that he\r\nshould continue his journey upstairs at once, as though he had never\r\nintended arresting it at Mr Holt\xe2\x80\x99s room, and begin by converting Mr and\r\nMrs Baxter, the Methodists in the top floor front. So this was what he\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nThese good people received him with open arms, and were quite ready to\r\ntalk. He was beginning to convert them from Methodism to the Church of\r\nEngland, when all at once he found himself embarrassed by discovering\r\nthat he did not know what he was to convert them from. He knew the\r\nChurch of England, or thought he did, but he knew nothing of Methodism\r\nbeyond its name. When he found that, according to Mr Baxter, the\r\nWesleyans had a vigorous system of Church discipline (which worked\r\nadmirably in practice) it appeared to him that John Wesley had\r\nanticipated the spiritual engine which he and Pryer were preparing, and\r\nwhen he left the room he was aware that he had caught more of a\r\nspiritual Tartar than he had expected. But he must certainly explain to\r\nPryer that the Wesleyans had a system of Church discipline. This was\r\nvery important.\r\n\r\nMr Baxter advised Ernest on no account to meddle with Mr Holt, and\r\nErnest was much relieved at the advice. If an opportunity arose of\r\ntouching the man\xe2\x80\x99s heart, he would take it; he would pat the children\r\non the head when he saw them on the stairs, and ingratiate himself with\r\nthem as far as he dared; they were sturdy youngsters, and Ernest was\r\nafraid even of them, for they were ready with their tongues, and knew\r\nmuch for their ages. Ernest felt that it would indeed be almost better\r\nfor him that a millstone should be hanged about his neck, and he cast\r\ninto the sea, than that he should offend one of the little Holts.\r\nHowever, he would try not to offend them; perhaps an occasional penny\r\nor two might square them. This was as much as he could do, for he saw\r\nthat the attempt to be instant out of season, as well as in season,\r\nwould, St Paul\xe2\x80\x99s injunction notwithstanding, end in failure.\r\n\r\nMrs Baxter gave a very bad account of Miss Emily Snow, who lodged in\r\nthe second floor back next to Mr Holt. Her story was quite different\r\nfrom that of Mrs Jupp the landlady. She would doubtless be only too\r\nglad to receive Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s ministrations or those of any other gentleman,\r\nbut she was no governess, she was in the ballet at Drury Lane, and\r\nbesides this, she was a very bad young woman, and if Mrs Baxter was\r\nlandlady would not be allowed to stay in the house a single hour, not\r\nshe indeed.\r\n\r\nMiss Maitland in the next room to Mrs Baxter\xe2\x80\x99s own was a quiet and\r\nrespectable young woman to all appearance; Mrs Baxter had never known\r\nof any goings on in that quarter, but, bless you, still waters run\r\ndeep, and these girls were all alike, one as bad as the other. She was\r\nout at all kinds of hours, and when you knew that you knew all.\r\n\r\nErnest did not pay much heed to these aspersions of Mrs Baxter\xe2\x80\x99s. Mrs\r\nJupp had got round the greater number of his many blind sides, and had\r\nwarned him not to believe Mrs Baxter, whose lip she said was something\r\nawful.\r\n\r\nErnest had heard that women were always jealous of one another, and\r\ncertainly these young women were more attractive than Mrs Baxter was,\r\nso jealousy was probably at the bottom of it. If they were maligned\r\nthere could be no objection to his making their acquaintance; if not\r\nmaligned they had all the more need of his ministrations. He would\r\nreclaim them at once.\r\n\r\nHe told Mrs Jupp of his intention. Mrs Jupp at first tried to dissuade\r\nhim, but seeing him resolute, suggested that she should herself see\r\nMiss Snow first, so as to prepare her and prevent her from being\r\nalarmed by his visit. She was not at home now, but in the course of the\r\nnext day, it should be arranged. In the meantime he had better try Mr\r\nShaw, the tinker, in the front kitchen. Mrs Baxter had told Ernest that\r\nMr Shaw was from the North Country, and an avowed freethinker; he would\r\nprobably, she said, rather like a visit, but she did not think Ernest\r\nwould stand much chance of making a convert of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore going down into the kitchen to convert the tinker Ernest ran\r\nhurriedly over his analysis of Paley\xe2\x80\x99s evidences, and put into his\r\npocket a copy of Archbishop Whateley\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cHistoric Doubts.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he\r\ndescended the dark rotten old stairs and knocked at the tinker\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\nMr Shaw was very civil; he said he was rather throng just now, but if\r\nErnest did not mind the sound of hammering he should be very glad of a\r\ntalk with him. Our hero, assenting to this, ere long led the\r\nconversation to Whateley\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cHistoric Doubts\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a work which, as the\r\nreader may know, pretends to show that there never was any such person\r\nas Napoleon Buonaparte, and thus satirises the arguments of those who\r\nhave attacked the Christian miracles.\r\n\r\nMr Shaw said he knew \xe2\x80\x9cHistoric Doubts\xe2\x80\x9d very well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what you think of it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ernest, who regarded the pamphlet as a\r\nmasterpiece of wit and cogency.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you really want to know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Shaw, with a sly twinkle, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink that he who was so willing and able to prove that what was was\r\nnot, would be equally able and willing to make a case for thinking that\r\nwhat was not was, if it suited his purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest was very much taken\r\naback. How was it that all the clever people of Cambridge had never put\r\nhim up to this simple rejoinder? The answer is easy: they did not\r\ndevelop it for the same reason that a hen had never developed webbed\r\nfeet\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, because they did not want to do so; but this was\r\nbefore the days of Evolution, and Ernest could not as yet know anything\r\nof the great principle that underlies it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr Shaw, \xe2\x80\x9cthese writers all get their living by\r\nwriting in a certain way, and the more they write in that way, the more\r\nthey are likely to get on. You should not call them dishonest for this\r\nany more than a judge should call a barrister dishonest for earning his\r\nliving by defending one in whose innocence he does not seriously\r\nbelieve; but you should hear the barrister on the other side before you\r\ndecide upon the case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was another facer. Ernest could only stammer that he had\r\nendeavoured to examine these questions as carefully as he could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think you have,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Shaw; \xe2\x80\x9cyou Oxford and Cambridge gentlemen\r\nthink you have examined everything. I have examined very little myself\r\nexcept the bottoms of old kettles and saucepans, but if you will answer\r\nme a few questions, I will tell you whether or no you have examined\r\nmuch more than I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest expressed his readiness to be questioned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tinker, \xe2\x80\x9cgive me the story of the Resurrection of\r\nJesus Christ as told in St John\xe2\x80\x99s gospel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say that Ernest mixed up the four accounts in a\r\ndeplorable manner; he even made the angel come down and roll away the\r\nstone and sit upon it. He was covered with confusion when the tinker\r\nfirst told him without the book of some of his many inaccuracies, and\r\nthen verified his criticisms by referring to the New Testament itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Shaw good naturedly, \xe2\x80\x9cI am an old man and you are a\r\nyoung one, so perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll not mind my giving you a piece of advice.\r\nI like you, for I believe you mean well, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve been real bad\r\nbrought up, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you have ever had so much as a chance\r\nyet. You know nothing of our side of the question, and I have just\r\nshown you that you do not know much more of your own, but I think you\r\nwill make a kind of Carlyle sort of a man some day. Now go upstairs and\r\nread the accounts of the Resurrection correctly without mixing them up,\r\nand have a clear idea of what it is that each writer tells us, then if\r\nyou feel inclined to pay me another visit I shall be glad to see you,\r\nfor I shall know you have made a good beginning and mean business. Till\r\nthen, Sir, I must wish you a very good morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest retreated abashed. An hour sufficed him to perform the task\r\nenjoined upon him by Mr Shaw; and at the end of that hour the \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\r\nno,\xe2\x80\x9d which still sounded in his ears as he heard it from Towneley, came\r\nringing up more loudly still from the very pages of the Bible itself,\r\nand in respect of the most important of all the events which are\r\nrecorded in it. Surely Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s first day\xe2\x80\x99s attempt at more promiscuous\r\nvisiting, and at carrying out his principles more thoroughly, had not\r\nbeen unfruitful. But he must go and have a talk with Pryer. He\r\ntherefore got his lunch and went to Pryer\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings. Pryer not being\r\nat home, he lounged to the British Museum Reading Room, then recently\r\nopened, sent for the \xe2\x80\x9cVestiges of Creation,\xe2\x80\x9d which he had never yet\r\nseen, and spent the rest of the afternoon in reading it.\r\n\r\nErnest did not see Pryer on the day of his conversation with Mr Shaw,\r\nbut he did so next morning and found him in a good temper, which of\r\nlate he had rarely been. Sometimes, indeed, he had behaved to Ernest in\r\na way which did not bode well for the harmony with which the College of\r\nSpiritual Pathology would work when it had once been founded. It almost\r\nseemed as though he were trying to get a complete moral ascendency over\r\nhim, so as to make him a creature of his own.\r\n\r\nHe did not think it possible that he could go too far, and indeed, when\r\nI reflect upon my hero\xe2\x80\x99s folly and inexperience, there is much to be\r\nsaid in excuse for the conclusion which Pryer came to.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, however, it was not so. Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s faith in Pryer\r\nhad been too great to be shaken down all in a moment, but it had been\r\nweakened lately more than once. Ernest had fought hard against allowing\r\nhimself to see this, nevertheless any third person who knew the pair\r\nwould have been able to see that the connection between the two might\r\nend at any moment, for when the time for one of Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s snipe-like\r\nchanges of flight came, he was quick in making it; the time, however,\r\nwas not yet come, and the intimacy between the two was apparently all\r\nthat it had ever been. It was only that horrid money business (so said\r\nErnest to himself) that caused any unpleasantness between them, and no\r\ndoubt Pryer was right, and he, Ernest, much too nervous. However, that\r\nmight stand over for the present.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, though he had received a shock by reason of his\r\nconversation with Mr Shaw, and by looking at the \xe2\x80\x9cVestiges,\xe2\x80\x9d he was as\r\nyet too much stunned to realise the change which was coming over him.\r\nIn each case the momentum of old habits carried him forward in the old\r\ndirection. He therefore called on Pryer, and spent an hour and more\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nHe did not say that he had been visiting among his neighbours; this to\r\nPryer would have been like a red rag to a bull. He only talked in much\r\nhis usual vein about the proposed College, the lamentable want of\r\ninterest in spiritual things which was characteristic of modern\r\nsociety, and other kindred matters; he concluded by saying that for the\r\npresent he feared Pryer was indeed right, and that nothing could be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs regards the laity,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pryer, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing; not until we have a\r\ndiscipline which we can enforce with pains and penalties. How can a\r\nsheep dog work a flock of sheep unless he can bite occasionally as well\r\nas bark? But as regards ourselves we can do much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPryer\xe2\x80\x99s manner was strange throughout the conversation, as though he\r\nwere thinking all the time of something else. His eyes wandered\r\ncuriously over Ernest, as Ernest had often noticed them wander before:\r\nthe words were about Church discipline, but somehow or other the\r\ndiscipline part of the story had a knack of dropping out after having\r\nbeen again and again emphatically declared to apply to the laity and\r\nnot to the clergy: once indeed Pryer had pettishly exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nbother the College of Spiritual Pathology.\xe2\x80\x9d As regards the clergy,\r\nglimpses of a pretty large cloven hoof kept peeping out from under the\r\nsaintly robe of Pryer\xe2\x80\x99s conversation, to the effect, that so long as\r\nthey were theoretically perfect, practical peccadilloes\xe2\x80\x94or even\r\npeccadaccios, if there is such a word, were of less importance. He was\r\nrestless, as though wanting to approach a subject which he did not\r\nquite venture to touch upon, and kept harping (he did this about every\r\nthird day) on the wretched lack of definition concerning the limits of\r\nvice and virtue, and the way in which half the vices wanted regulating\r\nrather than prohibiting. He dwelt also on the advantages of complete\r\nunreserve, and hinted that there were mysteries into which Ernest had\r\nnot yet been initiated, but which would enlighten him when he got to\r\nknow them, as he would be allowed to do when his friends saw that he\r\nwas strong enough.\r\n\r\nPryer had often been like this before, but never so nearly, as it\r\nseemed to Ernest, coming to a point\xe2\x80\x94though what the point was he could\r\nnot fully understand. His inquietude was communicating itself to\r\nErnest, who would probably ere long have come to know as much as Pryer\r\ncould tell him, but the conversation was abruptly interrupted by the\r\nappearance of a visitor. We shall never know how it would have ended,\r\nfor this was the very last time that Ernest ever saw Pryer. Perhaps\r\nPryer was going to break to him some bad news about his speculations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX\r\n\r\n\r\nErnest now went home and occupied himself till luncheon with studying\r\nDean Alford\xe2\x80\x99s notes upon the various Evangelistic records of the\r\nResurrection, doing as Mr Shaw had told him, and trying to find out not\r\nthat they were all accurate, but whether they were all accurate or no.\r\nHe did not care which result he should arrive at, but he was resolved\r\nthat he would reach one or the other. When he had finished Dean\r\nAlford\xe2\x80\x99s notes he found them come to this, namely, that no one yet had\r\nsucceeded in bringing the four accounts into tolerable harmony with\r\neach other, and that the Dean, seeing no chance of succeeding better\r\nthan his predecessors had done, recommended that the whole story should\r\nbe taken on trust\xe2\x80\x94and this Ernest was not prepared to do.\r\n\r\nHe got his luncheon, went out for a long walk, and returned to dinner\r\nat half past six. While Mrs Jupp was getting him his dinner\xe2\x80\x94a steak and\r\na pint of stout\xe2\x80\x94she told him that Miss Snow would be very happy to see\r\nhim in about an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time. This disconcerted him, for his mind was\r\ntoo unsettled for him to wish to convert anyone just then. He reflected\r\na little, and found that, in spite of the sudden shock to his opinions,\r\nhe was being irresistibly drawn to pay the visit as though nothing had\r\nhappened. It would not look well for him not to go, for he was known to\r\nbe in the house. He ought not to be in too great a hurry to change his\r\nopinions on such a matter as the evidence for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s Resurrection all\r\nof a sudden\xe2\x80\x94besides he need not talk to Miss Snow about this subject\r\nto-day\xe2\x80\x94there were other things he might talk about. What other things?\r\nErnest felt his heart beat fast and fiercely, and an inward monitor\r\nwarned him that he was thinking of anything rather than of Miss Snow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nWhat should he do? Fly, fly, fly\xe2\x80\x94it was the only safety. But would\r\nChrist have fled? Even though Christ had not died and risen from the\r\ndead there could be no question that He was the model whose example we\r\nwere bound to follow. Christ would not have fled from Miss Snow; he was\r\nsure of that, for He went about more especially with prostitutes and\r\ndisreputable people. Now, as then, it was the business of the true\r\nChristian to call not the righteous but sinners to repentance. It would\r\nbe inconvenient to him to change his lodgings, and he could not ask Mrs\r\nJupp to turn Miss Snow and Miss Maitland out of the house. Where was he\r\nto draw the line? Who would be just good enough to live in the same\r\nhouse with him, and who just not good enough?\r\n\r\nBesides, where were these poor girls to go? Was he to drive them from\r\nhouse to house till they had no place to lie in? It was absurd; his\r\nduty was clear: he would go and see Miss Snow at once, and try if he\r\ncould not induce her to change her present mode of life; if he found\r\ntemptation becoming too strong for him he would fly then\xe2\x80\x94so he went\r\nupstairs with his Bible under his arm, and a consuming fire in his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nHe found Miss Snow looking very pretty in a neatly, not to say\r\ndemurely, furnished room. I think she had bought an illuminated text or\r\ntwo, and pinned it up over her fireplace that morning. Ernest was very\r\nmuch pleased with her, and mechanically placed his Bible upon the\r\ntable. He had just opened a timid conversation and was deep in blushes,\r\nwhen a hurried step came bounding up the stairs as though of one over\r\nwhom the force of gravity had little power, and a man burst into the\r\nroom saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m come before my time.\xe2\x80\x9d It was Towneley.\r\n\r\nHis face dropped as he caught sight of Ernest. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, you here,\r\nPontifex! Well, upon my word!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI cannot describe the hurried explanations that passed quickly between\r\nthe three\xe2\x80\x94enough that in less than a minute Ernest, blushing more\r\nscarlet than ever, slunk off, Bible and all, deeply humiliated as he\r\ncontrasted himself and Towneley. Before he had reached the bottom of\r\nthe staircase leading to his own room he heard Towneley\xe2\x80\x99s hearty laugh\r\nthrough Miss Snow\xe2\x80\x99s door, and cursed the hour that he was born.\r\n\r\nThen it flashed upon him that if he could not see Miss Snow he could at\r\nany rate see Miss Maitland. He knew well enough what he wanted now, and\r\nas for the Bible, he pushed it from him to the other end of his table.\r\nIt fell over on to the floor, and he kicked it into a corner. It was\r\nthe Bible given him at his christening by his affectionate aunt,\r\nElizabeth Allaby. True, he knew very little of Miss Maitland, but\r\nignorant young fools in Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s state do not reflect or reason\r\nclosely. Mrs Baxter had said that Miss Maitland and Miss Snow were\r\nbirds of a feather, and Mrs Baxter probably knew better than that old\r\nliar, Mrs Jupp. Shakespeare says:\r\n\r\nO Opportunity, thy guilt is great\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis thou that execut\xe2\x80\x99st the traitor\xe2\x80\x99s treason:\r\nThou set\xe2\x80\x99st the wolf where he the lamb may get;\r\nWhoever plots the sin, thou \xe2\x80\x99point\xe2\x80\x99st the season;\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis thou that spurn\xe2\x80\x99st at right, at law, at reason;\r\n    And in thy shady cell, where none may spy him,\r\n    Sits Sin, to seize the souls that wander by him.\r\n\r\nIf the guilt of opportunity is great, how much greater is the guilt of\r\nthat which is believed to be opportunity, but in reality is no\r\nopportunity at all. If the better part of valour is discretion, how\r\nmuch more is not discretion the better part of vice\r\n\r\nAbout ten minutes after we last saw Ernest, a scared, insulted girl,\r\nflushed and trembling, was seen hurrying from Mrs Jupp\xe2\x80\x99s house as fast\r\nas her agitated state would let her, and in another ten minutes two\r\npolicemen were seen also coming out of Mrs Jupp\xe2\x80\x99s, between whom there\r\nshambled rather than walked our unhappy friend Ernest, with staring\r\neyes, ghastly pale, and with despair branded upon every line of his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI\r\n\r\n\r\nPryer had done well to warn Ernest against promiscuous house to house\r\nvisitation. He had not gone outside Mrs Jupp\xe2\x80\x99s street door, and yet\r\nwhat had been the result?\r\n\r\nMr Holt had put him in bodily fear; Mr and Mrs Baxter had nearly made a\r\nMethodist of him; Mr Shaw had undermined his faith in the Resurrection;\r\nMiss Snow\xe2\x80\x99s charms had ruined\xe2\x80\x94or would have done so but for an\r\naccident\xe2\x80\x94his moral character. As for Miss Maitland, he had done his\r\nbest to ruin hers, and had damaged himself gravely and irretrievably in\r\nconsequence. The only lodger who had done him no harm was the bellows\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmender, whom he had not visited.\r\n\r\nOther young clergymen, much greater fools in many respects than he,\r\nwould not have got into these scrapes. He seemed to have developed an\r\naptitude for mischief almost from the day of his having been ordained.\r\nHe could hardly preach without making some horrid _faux pas_. He\r\npreached one Sunday morning when the Bishop was at his Rector\xe2\x80\x99s church,\r\nand made his sermon turn upon the question what kind of little cake it\r\nwas that the widow of Zarephath had intended making when Elijah found\r\nher gathering a few sticks. He demonstrated that it was a seed cake.\r\nThe sermon was really very amusing, and more than once he saw a smile\r\npass over the sea of faces underneath him. The Bishop was very angry,\r\nand gave my hero a severe reprimand in the vestry after service was\r\nover; the only excuse he could make was that he was preaching _ex\r\ntempore_, had not thought of this particular point till he was actually\r\nin the pulpit, and had then been carried away by it.\r\n\r\nAnother time he preached upon the barren fig-tree, and described the\r\nhopes of the owner as he watched the delicate blossom unfold, and give\r\npromise of such beautiful fruit in autumn. Next day he received a\r\nletter from a botanical member of his congregation who explained to him\r\nthat this could hardly have been, inasmuch as the fig produces its\r\nfruit first and blossoms inside the fruit, or so nearly so that no\r\nflower is perceptible to an ordinary observer. This last, however, was\r\nan accident which might have happened to any one but a scientist or an\r\ninspired writer.\r\n\r\nThe only excuse I can make for him is that he was very young\xe2\x80\x94not yet\r\nfour and twenty\xe2\x80\x94and that in mind as in body, like most of those who in\r\nthe end come to think for themselves, he was a slow grower. By far the\r\ngreater part, moreover, of his education had been an attempt, not so\r\nmuch to keep him in blinkers as to gouge his eyes out altogether.\r\n\r\nBut to return to my story. It transpired afterwards that Miss Maitland\r\nhad had no intention of giving Ernest in charge when she ran out of Mrs\r\nJupp\xe2\x80\x99s house. She was running away because she was frightened, but\r\nalmost the first person whom she ran against had happened to be a\r\npoliceman of a serious turn of mind, who wished to gain a reputation\r\nfor activity. He stopped her, questioned her, frightened her still\r\nmore, and it was he rather than Miss Maitland, who insisted on giving\r\nmy hero in charge to himself and another constable.\r\n\r\nTowneley was still in Mrs Jupp\xe2\x80\x99s house when the policeman came. He had\r\nheard a disturbance, and going down to Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s room while Miss\r\nMaitland was out of doors, had found him lying, as it were, stunned at\r\nthe foot of the moral precipice over which he had that moment fallen.\r\nHe saw the whole thing at a glance, but before he could take action,\r\nthe policemen came in and action became impossible.\r\n\r\nHe asked Ernest who were his friends in London. Ernest at first wanted\r\nnot to say, but Towneley soon gave him to understand that he must do as\r\nhe was bid, and selected myself from the few whom he had named. \xe2\x80\x9cWrites\r\nfor the stage, does he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Towneley. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes he write comedy?\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest\r\nthought Towneley meant that I ought to write tragedy, and said he was\r\nafraid I wrote burlesque. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, come, come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Towneley, \xe2\x80\x9cthat will\r\ndo famously. I will go and see him at once.\xe2\x80\x9d But on second thoughts he\r\ndetermined to stay with Ernest and go with him to the police court. So\r\nhe sent Mrs Jupp for me. Mrs Jupp hurried so fast to fetch me, that in\r\nspite of the weather\xe2\x80\x99s being still cold she was \xe2\x80\x9cgiving out,\xe2\x80\x9d as she\r\nexpressed it, in streams. The poor old wretch would have taken a cab,\r\nbut she had no money and did not like to ask Towneley to give her some.\r\nI saw that something very serious had happened, but was not prepared\r\nfor anything so deplorable as what Mrs Jupp actually told me. As for\r\nMrs Jupp, she said her heart had been jumping out of its socket and\r\nback again ever since.\r\n\r\nI got her into a cab with me, and we went off to the police station.\r\nShe talked without ceasing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if the neighbours do say cruel things about me, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nno thanks to _him_ if they\xe2\x80\x99re true. Mr Pontifex never took a bit o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnotice of me no more than if I had been his sister. Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s enough to\r\nmake anyone\xe2\x80\x99s back bone curdle. Then I thought perhaps my Rose might\r\nget on better with him, so I set her to dust him and clean him as\r\nthough I were busy, and gave her such a beautiful clean new pinny, but\r\nhe never took no notice of her no more than he did of me, and she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t want no compliment neither, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have taken not a\r\nshilling from him, though he had offered it, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to know\r\nanything at all. I can\xe2\x80\x99t make out what the young men are a-coming to; I\r\nwish the horn may blow for me and the worms take me this very night, if\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s not enough to make a woman stand before God and strike the one\r\nhalf on \xe2\x80\x99em silly to see the way they goes on, and many an honest girl\r\nhas to go home night after night without so much as a fourpenny bit and\r\npaying three and sixpence a week rent, and not a shelf nor cupboard in\r\nthe place and a dead wall in front of the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not Mr Pontifex,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s so bad, he\xe2\x80\x99s good at\r\nheart. He never says nothing unkind. And then there\xe2\x80\x99s his dear eyes\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nwhen I speak about that to my Rose she calls me an old fool and says I\r\nought to be poleaxed. It\xe2\x80\x99s that Pryer as I can\xe2\x80\x99t abide. Oh he! He likes\r\nto wound a woman\xe2\x80\x99s feelings he do, and to chuck anything in her face,\r\nhe do\xe2\x80\x94he likes to wind a woman up and to wound her down.\xe2\x80\x9d (Mrs Jupp\r\npronounced \xe2\x80\x9cwound\xe2\x80\x9d as though it rhymed to \xe2\x80\x9csound.\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplace to soothe a woman, but he, he\xe2\x80\x99d like to tear her hair out by\r\nhandfuls. Why, he told me to my face that I was a-getting old; old\r\nindeed! there\xe2\x80\x99s not a woman in London knows my age except Mrs Davis\r\ndown in the Old Kent Road, and beyond a haricot vein in one of my legs\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m as young as ever I was. Old indeed! There\xe2\x80\x99s many a good tune played\r\non an old fiddle. I hate his nasty insinuendos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven if I had wanted to stop her, I could not have done so. She said a\r\ngreat deal more than I have given above. I have left out much because I\r\ncould not remember it, but still more because it was really impossible\r\nfor me to print it.\r\n\r\nWhen we got to the police station I found Towneley and Ernest already\r\nthere. The charge was one of assault, but not aggravated by serious\r\nviolence. Even so, however, it was lamentable enough, and we both saw\r\nthat our young friend would have to pay dearly for his inexperience. We\r\ntried to bail him out for the night, but the Inspector would not accept\r\nbail, so we were forced to leave him.\r\n\r\nTowneley then went back to Mrs Jupp\xe2\x80\x99s to see if he could find Miss\r\nMaitland and arrange matters with her. She was not there, but he traced\r\nher to the house of her father, who lived at Camberwell. The father was\r\nfurious and would not hear of any intercession on Towneley\xe2\x80\x99s part. He\r\nwas a Dissenter, and glad to make the most of any scandal against a\r\nclergyman; Towneley, therefore, was obliged to return unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nNext morning, Towneley\xe2\x80\x94who regarded Ernest as a drowning man, who must\r\nbe picked out of the water somehow or other if possible, irrespective\r\nof the way in which he got into it\xe2\x80\x94called on me, and we put the matter\r\ninto the hands of one of the best known attorneys of the day. I was\r\ngreatly pleased with Towneley, and thought it due to him to tell him\r\nwhat I had told no one else. I mean that Ernest would come into his\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s money in a few years\xe2\x80\x99 time, and would therefore then be rich.\r\n\r\nTowneley was doing all he could before this, but I knew that the\r\nknowledge I had imparted to him would make him feel as though Ernest\r\nwas more one of his own class, and had therefore a greater claim upon\r\nhis good offices. As for Ernest himself, his gratitude was greater than\r\ncould be expressed in words. I have heard him say that he can call to\r\nmind many moments, each one of which might well pass for the happiest\r\nof his life, but that this night stands clearly out as the most painful\r\nthat he ever passed, yet so kind and considerate was Towneley that it\r\nwas quite bearable.\r\n\r\nBut with all the best wishes in the world neither Towneley nor I could\r\ndo much to help beyond giving our moral support. Our attorney told us\r\nthat the magistrate before whom Ernest would appear was very severe on\r\ncases of this description, and that the fact of his being a clergyman\r\nwould tell against him. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk for no remand,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand make no\r\ndefence. We will call Mr Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s rector and you two gentlemen as\r\nwitnesses for previous good character. These will be enough. Let us\r\nthen make a profound apology and beg the magistrate to deal with the\r\ncase summarily instead of sending it for trial. If you can get this,\r\nbelieve me, your young friend will be better out of it than he has any\r\nright to expect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advice, besides being obviously sensible, would end in saving\r\nErnest both time and suspense of mind, so we had no hesitation in\r\nadopting it. The case was called on about eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, but we got it\r\nadjourned till three, so as to give time for Ernest to set his affairs\r\nas straight as he could, and to execute a power of attorney enabling me\r\nto act for him as I should think fit while he was in prison.\r\n\r\nThen all came out about Pryer and the College of Spiritual Pathology.\r\nErnest had even greater difficulty in making a clean breast of this\r\nthan he had had in telling us about Miss Maitland, but he told us all,\r\nand the upshot was that he had actually handed over to Pryer every\r\nhalfpenny that he then possessed with no other security than Pryer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nI.O.U.\xe2\x80\x99s for the amount. Ernest, though still declining to believe that\r\nPryer could be guilty of dishonourable conduct, was becoming alive to\r\nthe folly of what he had been doing; he still made sure, however, of\r\nrecovering, at any rate, the greater part of his property as soon as\r\nPryer should have had time to sell. Towneley and I were of a different\r\nopinion, but we did not say what we thought.\r\n\r\nIt was dreary work waiting all the morning amid such unfamiliar and\r\ndepressing surroundings. I thought how the Psalmist had exclaimed with\r\nquiet irony, \xe2\x80\x9cOne day in thy courts is better than a thousand,\xe2\x80\x9d and I\r\nthought that I could utter a very similar sentiment in respect of the\r\nCourts in which Towneley and I were compelled to loiter. At last, about\r\nthree o\xe2\x80\x99clock the case was called on, and we went round to the part of\r\nthe court which is reserved for the general public, while Ernest was\r\ntaken into the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s dock. As soon as he had collected himself\r\nsufficiently he recognised the magistrate as the old gentleman who had\r\nspoken to him in the train on the day he was leaving school, and saw,\r\nor thought he saw, to his great grief, that he too was recognised.\r\n\r\nMr Ottery, for this was our attorney\xe2\x80\x99s name, took the line he had\r\nproposed. He called no other witnesses than the rector, Towneley and\r\nmyself, and threw himself on the mercy of the magistrate. When he had\r\nconcluded, the magistrate spoke as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cErnest Pontifex, yours is\r\none of the most painful cases that I have ever had to deal with. You\r\nhave been singularly favoured in your parentage and education. You have\r\nhad before you the example of blameless parents, who doubtless\r\ninstilled into you from childhood the enormity of the offence which by\r\nyour own confession you have committed. You were sent to one of the\r\nbest public schools in England. It is not likely that in the healthy\r\natmosphere of such a school as Roughborough you can have come across\r\ncontaminating influences; you were probably, I may say certainly,\r\nimpressed at school with the heinousness of any attempt to depart from\r\nthe strictest chastity until such time as you had entered into a state\r\nof matrimony. At Cambridge you were shielded from impurity by every\r\nobstacle which virtuous and vigilant authorities could devise, and even\r\nhad the obstacles been fewer, your parents probably took care that your\r\nmeans should not admit of your throwing money away upon abandoned\r\ncharacters. At night proctors patrolled the street and dogged your\r\nsteps if you tried to go into any haunt where the presence of vice was\r\nsuspected. By day the females who were admitted within the college\r\nwalls were selected mainly on the score of age and ugliness. It is hard\r\nto see what more can be done for any young man than this. For the last\r\nfour or five months you have been a clergyman, and if a single impure\r\nthought had still remained within your mind, ordination should have\r\nremoved it: nevertheless, not only does it appear that your mind is as\r\nimpure as though none of the influences to which I have referred had\r\nbeen brought to bear upon it, but it seems as though their only result\r\nhad been this\xe2\x80\x94that you have not even the common sense to be able to\r\ndistinguish between a respectable girl and a prostitute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were to take a strict view of my duty I should commit you for\r\ntrial, but in consideration of this being your first offence, I shall\r\ndeal leniently with you and sentence you to imprisonment with hard\r\nlabour for six calendar months.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTowneley and I both thought there was a touch of irony in the\r\nmagistrate\xe2\x80\x99s speech, and that he could have given a lighter sentence if\r\nhe would, but that was neither here nor there. We obtained leave to see\r\nErnest for a few minutes before he was removed to Coldbath Fields,\r\nwhere he was to serve his term, and found him so thankful to have been\r\nsummarily dealt with that he hardly seemed to care about the miserable\r\nplight in which he was to pass the next six months. When he came out,\r\nhe said, he would take what remained of his money, go off to America or\r\nAustralia and never be heard of more.\r\n\r\nWe left him full of this resolve, I, to write to Theobald, and also to\r\ninstruct my solicitor to get Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s money out of Pryer\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and\r\nTowneley to see the reporters and keep the case out of the newspapers.\r\nHe was successful as regards all the higher-class papers. There was\r\nonly one journal, and that of the lowest class, which was\r\nincorruptible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nI saw my solicitor at once, but when I tried to write to Theobald, I\r\nfound it better to say I would run down and see him. I therefore\r\nproposed this, asking him to meet me at the station, and hinting that I\r\nmust bring bad news about his son. I knew he would not get my letter\r\nmore than a couple of hours before I should see him, and thought the\r\nshort interval of suspense might break the shock of what I had to say.\r\n\r\nNever do I remember to have halted more between two opinions than on my\r\njourney to Battersby upon this unhappy errand. When I thought of the\r\nlittle sallow-faced lad whom I had remembered years before, of the long\r\nand savage cruelty with which he had been treated in childhood\xe2\x80\x94cruelty\r\nnone the less real for having been due to ignorance and stupidity\r\nrather than to deliberate malice; of the atmosphere of lying and\r\nself-laudatory hallucination in which he had been brought up; of the\r\nreadiness the boy had shown to love anything that would be good enough\r\nto let him, and of how affection for his parents, unless I am much\r\nmistaken, had only died in him because it had been killed anew, again\r\nand again and again, each time that it had tried to spring. When I\r\nthought of all this I felt as though, if the matter had rested with me,\r\nI would have sentenced Theobald and Christina to mental suffering even\r\nmore severe than that which was about to fall upon them. But on the\r\nother hand, when I thought of Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s own childhood, of that\r\ndreadful old George Pontifex his father, of John and Mrs John, and of\r\nhis two sisters, when again I thought of Christina\xe2\x80\x99s long years of hope\r\ndeferred that maketh the heart sick, before she was married, of the\r\nlife she must have led at Crampsford, and of the surroundings in the\r\nmidst of which she and her husband both lived at Battersby, I felt as\r\nthough the wonder was that misfortunes so persistent had not been\r\nfollowed by even graver retribution.\r\n\r\nPoor people! They had tried to keep their ignorance of the world from\r\nthemselves by calling it the pursuit of heavenly things, and then\r\nshutting their eyes to anything that might give them trouble. A son\r\nhaving been born to them they had shut his eyes also as far as was\r\npracticable. Who could blame them? They had chapter and verse for\r\neverything they had either done or left undone; there is no better\r\nthumbed precedent than that for being a clergyman and a clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife. In what respect had they differed from their neighbours? How did\r\ntheir household differ from that of any other clergyman of the better\r\nsort from one end of England to the other? Why then should it have been\r\nupon them, of all people in the world, that this tower of Siloam had\r\nfallen?\r\n\r\nSurely it was the tower of Siloam that was naught rather than those who\r\nstood under it; it was the system rather than the people that was at\r\nfault. If Theobald and his wife had but known more of the world and of\r\nthe things that are therein, they would have done little harm to\r\nanyone. Selfish they would have always been, but not more so than may\r\nvery well be pardoned, and not more than other people would be. As it\r\nwas, the case was hopeless; it would be no use their even entering into\r\ntheir mothers\xe2\x80\x99 wombs and being born again. They must not only be born\r\nagain but they must be born again each one of them of a new father and\r\nof a new mother and of a different line of ancestry for many\r\ngenerations before their minds could become supple enough to learn\r\nanew. The only thing to do with them was to humour them and make the\r\nbest of them till they died\xe2\x80\x94and be thankful when they did so.\r\n\r\nTheobald got my letter as I had expected, and met me at the station\r\nnearest to Battersby. As I walked back with him towards his own house I\r\nbroke the news to him as gently as I could. I pretended that the whole\r\nthing was in great measure a mistake, and that though Ernest no doubt\r\nhad had intentions which he ought to have resisted, he had not meant\r\ngoing anything like the length which Miss Maitland supposed. I said we\r\nhad felt how much appearances were against him, and had not dared to\r\nset up this defence before the magistrate, though we had no doubt about\r\nits being the true one.\r\n\r\nTheobald acted with a readier and acuter moral sense than I had given\r\nhim credit for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will have nothing more to do with him,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed promptly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill never see his face again; do not let him write either to me or to\r\nhis mother; we know of no such person. Tell him you have seen me, and\r\nthat from this day forward I shall put him out of my mind as though he\r\nhad never been born. I have been a good father to him, and his mother\r\nidolised him; selfishness and ingratitude have been the only return we\r\nhave ever had from him; my hope henceforth must be in my remaining\r\nchildren.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI told him how Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s fellow curate had got hold of his money, and\r\nhinted that he might very likely be penniless, or nearly so, on leaving\r\nprison. Theobald did not seem displeased at this, but added soon\r\nafterwards: \xe2\x80\x9cIf this proves to be the case, tell him from me that I\r\nwill give him a hundred pounds if he will tell me through you when he\r\nwill have it paid, but tell him not to write and thank me, and say that\r\nif he attempts to open up direct communication either with his mother\r\nor myself, he shall not have a penny of the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKnowing what I knew, and having determined on violating Miss Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninstructions should the occasion arise, I did not think Ernest would be\r\nany the worse for a complete estrangement from his family, so I\r\nacquiesced more readily in what Theobald had proposed than that\r\ngentleman may have expected.\r\n\r\nThinking it better that I should not see Christina, I left Theobald\r\nnear Battersby and walked back to the station. On my way I was pleased\r\nto reflect that Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s father was less of a fool than I had taken him\r\nto be, and had the greater hopes, therefore, that his son\xe2\x80\x99s blunders\r\nmight be due to postnatal, rather than congenital misfortunes.\r\nAccidents which happen to a man before he is born, in the persons of\r\nhis ancestors, will, if he remembers them at all, leave an indelible\r\nimpression on him; they will have moulded his character so that, do\r\nwhat he will, it is hardly possible for him to escape their\r\nconsequences. If a man is to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, he must\r\ndo so, not only as a little child, but as a little embryo, or rather as\r\na little zoosperm\xe2\x80\x94and not only this, but as one that has come of\r\nzoosperms which have entered into the Kingdom of Heaven before him for\r\nmany generations. Accidents which occur for the first time, and belong\r\nto the period since a man\xe2\x80\x99s last birth, are not, as a general rule, so\r\npermanent in their effects, though of course they may sometimes be so.\r\nAt any rate, I was not displeased at the view which Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s father\r\ntook of the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Ernest had been sentenced, he was taken back to the cells to wait\r\nfor the van which should take him to Coldbath Fields, where he was to\r\nserve his term.\r\n\r\nHe was still too stunned and dazed by the suddenness with which events\r\nhad happened during the last twenty-four hours to be able to realise\r\nhis position. A great chasm had opened between his past and future;\r\nnevertheless he breathed, his pulse beat, he could think and speak. It\r\nseemed to him that he ought to be prostrated by the blow that had\r\nfallen on him, but he was not prostrated; he had suffered from many\r\nsmaller laches far more acutely. It was not until he thought of the\r\npain his disgrace would inflict on his father and mother that he felt\r\nhow readily he would have given up all he had, rather than have fallen\r\ninto his present plight. It would break his mother\xe2\x80\x99s heart. It must, he\r\nknew it would\xe2\x80\x94and it was he who had done this.\r\n\r\nHe had had a headache coming on all the forenoon, but as he thought of\r\nhis father and mother, his pulse quickened, and the pain in his head\r\nsuddenly became intense. He could hardly walk to the van, and he found\r\nits motion insupportable. On reaching the prison he was too ill to walk\r\nwithout assistance across the hall to the corridor or gallery where\r\nprisoners are marshalled on their arrival. The prison warder, seeing at\r\nonce that he was a clergyman, did not suppose he was shamming, as he\r\nmight have done in the case of an old gaol-bird; he therefore sent for\r\nthe doctor. When this gentleman arrived, Ernest was declared to be\r\nsuffering from an incipient attack of brain fever, and was taken away\r\nto the infirmary. Here he hovered for the next two months between life\r\nand death, never in full possession of his reason and often delirious,\r\nbut at last, contrary to the expectation of both doctor and nurse, he\r\nbegan slowly to recover.\r\n\r\nIt is said that those who have been nearly drowned, find the return to\r\nconsciousness much more painful than the loss of it had been, and so it\r\nwas with my hero. As he lay helpless and feeble, it seemed to him a\r\nrefinement of cruelty that he had not died once for all during his\r\ndelirium. He thought he should still most likely recover only to sink a\r\nlittle later on from shame and sorrow; nevertheless from day to day he\r\nmended, though so slowly that he could hardly realise it to himself.\r\nOne afternoon, however, about three weeks after he had regained\r\nconsciousness, the nurse who tended him, and who had been very kind to\r\nhim, made some little rallying sally which amused him; he laughed, and\r\nas he did so, she clapped her hands and told him he would be a man\r\nagain. The spark of hope was kindled, and again he wished to live.\r\nAlmost from that moment his thoughts began to turn less to the horrors\r\nof the past, and more to the best way of meeting the future.\r\n\r\nHis worst pain was on behalf of his father and mother, and how he\r\nshould again face them. It still seemed to him that the best thing both\r\nfor him and them would be that he should sever himself from them\r\ncompletely, take whatever money he could recover from Pryer, and go to\r\nsome place in the uttermost parts of the earth, where he should never\r\nmeet anyone who had known him at school or college, and start afresh.\r\nOr perhaps he might go to the gold fields in California or Australia,\r\nof which such wonderful accounts were then heard; there he might even\r\nmake his fortune, and return as an old man many years hence, unknown to\r\neveryone, and if so, he would live at Cambridge. As he built these\r\ncastles in the air, the spark of life became a flame, and he longed for\r\nhealth, and for the freedom which, now that so much of his sentence had\r\nexpired, was not after all very far distant.\r\n\r\nThen things began to shape themselves more definitely. Whatever\r\nhappened he would be a clergyman no longer. It would have been\r\npractically impossible for him to have found another curacy, even if he\r\nhad been so minded, but he was not so minded. He hated the life he had\r\nbeen leading ever since he had begun to read for orders; he could not\r\nargue about it, but simply he loathed it and would have no more of it.\r\nAs he dwelt on the prospect of becoming a layman again, however\r\ndisgraced, he rejoiced at what had befallen him, and found a blessing\r\nin this very imprisonment which had at first seemed such an unspeakable\r\nmisfortune.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the shock of so great a change in his surroundings had\r\naccelerated changes in his opinions, just as the cocoons of silkworms,\r\nwhen sent in baskets by rail, hatch before their time through the\r\nnovelty of heat and jolting. But however this may be, his belief in the\r\nstories concerning the Death, Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus\r\nChrist, and hence his faith in all the other Christian miracles, had\r\ndropped off him once and for ever. The investigation he had made in\r\nconsequence of Mr Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s rebuke, hurried though it was, had left a deep\r\nimpression upon him, and now he was well enough to read he made the New\r\nTestament his chief study, going through it in the spirit which Mr Shaw\r\nhad desired of him, that is to say as one who wished neither to believe\r\nnor disbelieve, but cared only about finding out whether he ought to\r\nbelieve or no. The more he read in this spirit the more the balance\r\nseemed to lie in favour of unbelief, till, in the end, all further\r\ndoubt became impossible, and he saw plainly enough that, whatever else\r\nmight be true, the story that Christ had died, come to life again, and\r\nbeen carried from earth through clouds into the heavens could not now\r\nbe accepted by unbiassed people. It was well he had found it out so\r\nsoon. In one way or another it was sure to meet him sooner or later. He\r\nwould probably have seen it years ago if he had not been hoodwinked by\r\npeople who were paid for hoodwinking him. What should he have done, he\r\nasked himself, if he had not made his present discovery till years\r\nlater when he was more deeply committed to the life of a clergyman?\r\nShould he have had the courage to face it, or would he not more\r\nprobably have evolved some excellent reason for continuing to think as\r\nhe had thought hitherto? Should he have had the courage to break away\r\neven from his present curacy?\r\n\r\nHe thought not, and knew not whether to be more thankful for having\r\nbeen shown his error or for having been caught up and twisted round so\r\nthat he could hardly err farther, almost at the very moment of his\r\nhaving discovered it. The price he had had to pay for this boon was\r\nlight as compared with the boon itself. What is too heavy a price to\r\npay for having duty made at once clear and easy of fulfilment instead\r\nof very difficult? He was sorry for his father and mother, and he was\r\nsorry for Miss Maitland, but he was no longer sorry for himself.\r\n\r\nIt puzzled him, however, that he should not have known how much he had\r\nhated being a clergyman till now. He knew that he did not particularly\r\nlike it, but if anyone had asked him whether he actually hated it, he\r\nwould have answered no. I suppose people almost always want something\r\nexternal to themselves, to reveal to them their own likes and dislikes.\r\nOur most assured likings have for the most part been arrived at neither\r\nby introspection nor by any process of conscious reasoning, but by the\r\nbounding forth of the heart to welcome the gospel proclaimed to it by\r\nanother. We hear some say that such and such a thing is thus or thus,\r\nand in a moment the train that has been laid within us, but whose\r\npresence we knew not, flashes into consciousness and perception.\r\n\r\nOnly a year ago he had bounded forth to welcome Mr Hawke\xe2\x80\x99s sermon;\r\nsince then he had bounded after a College of Spiritual Pathology; now\r\nhe was in full cry after rationalism pure and simple; how could he be\r\nsure that his present state of mind would be more lasting than his\r\nprevious ones? He could not be certain, but he felt as though he were\r\nnow on firmer ground than he had ever been before, and no matter how\r\nfleeting his present opinions might prove to be, he could not but act\r\naccording to them till he saw reason to change them. How impossible, he\r\nreflected, it would have been for him to do this, if he had remained\r\nsurrounded by people like his father and mother, or Pryer and Pryer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriends, and his rector. He had been observing, reflecting, and\r\nassimilating all these months with no more consciousness of mental\r\ngrowth than a school-boy has of growth of body, but should he have been\r\nable to admit his growth to himself, and to act up to his increased\r\nstrength if he had remained in constant close connection with people\r\nwho assured him solemnly that he was under a hallucination? The\r\ncombination against him was greater than his unaided strength could\r\nhave broken through, and he felt doubtful how far any shock less severe\r\nthan the one from which he was suffering would have sufficed to free\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV\r\n\r\n\r\nAs he lay on his bed day after day slowly recovering he woke up to the\r\nfact which most men arrive at sooner or later, I mean that very few\r\ncare two straws about truth, or have any confidence that it is righter\r\nand better to believe what is true than what is untrue, even though\r\nbelief in the untruth may seem at first sight most expedient. Yet it is\r\nonly these few who can be said to believe anything at all; the rest are\r\nsimply unbelievers in disguise. Perhaps, after all, these last are\r\nright. They have numbers and prosperity on their side. They have all\r\nwhich the rationalist appeals to as his tests of right and wrong.\r\nRight, according to him, is what seems right to the majority of\r\nsensible, well-to-do people; we know of no safer criterion than this,\r\nbut what does the decision thus arrived at involve? Simply this, that a\r\nconspiracy of silence about things whose truth would be immediately\r\napparent to disinterested enquirers is not only tolerable but righteous\r\non the part of those who profess to be and take money for being _par\r\nexcellence_ guardians and teachers of truth.\r\n\r\nErnest saw no logical escape from this conclusion. He saw that belief\r\non the part of the early Christians in the miraculous nature of\r\nChrist\xe2\x80\x99s Resurrection was explicable, without any supposition of\r\nmiracle. The explanation lay under the eyes of anyone who chose to take\r\na moderate degree of trouble; it had been put before the world again\r\nand again, and there had been no serious attempt to refute it. How was\r\nit that Dean Alford for example who had made the New Testament his\r\nspeciality, could not or would not see what was so obvious to Ernest\r\nhimself? Could it be for any other reason than that he did not want to\r\nsee it, and if so was he not a traitor to the cause of truth? Yes, but\r\nwas he not also a respectable and successful man, and were not the vast\r\nmajority of respectable and successful men, such for example, as all\r\nthe bishops and archbishops, doing exactly as Dean Alford did, and did\r\nnot this make their action right, no matter though it had been\r\ncannibalism or infanticide, or even habitual untruthfulness of mind?\r\n\r\nMonstrous, odious falsehood! Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s feeble pulse quickened and his\r\npale face flushed as this hateful view of life presented itself to him\r\nin all its logical consistency. It was not the fact of most men being\r\nliars that shocked him\xe2\x80\x94that was all right enough; but even the\r\nmomentary doubt whether the few who were not liars ought not to become\r\nliars too. There was no hope left if this were so; if this were so, let\r\nhim die, the sooner the better. \xe2\x80\x9cLord,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed inwardly, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve one word of it. Strengthen Thou and confirm my disbelief.\xe2\x80\x9d It\r\nseemed to him that he could never henceforth see a bishop going to\r\nconsecration without saying to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cThere, but for the grace of\r\nGod, went Ernest Pontifex.\xe2\x80\x9d It was no doing of his. He could not boast;\r\nif he had lived in the time of Christ he might himself have been an\r\nearly Christian, or even an Apostle for aught he knew. On the whole he\r\nfelt that he had much to be thankful for.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion, then, that it might be better to believe error than\r\ntruth should be ordered out of court at once, no matter by how clear a\r\nlogic it had been arrived at; but what was the alternative? It was\r\nthis, that our criterion of truth\xe2\x80\x94i.e. that truth is what commends\r\nitself to the great majority of sensible and successful people\xe2\x80\x94is not\r\ninfallible. The rule is sound, and covers by far the greater number of\r\ncases, but it has its exceptions.\r\n\r\nHe asked himself, what were they? Ah! that was a difficult matter;\r\nthere were so many, and the rules which governed them were sometimes so\r\nsubtle, that mistakes always had and always would be made; it was just\r\nthis that made it impossible to reduce life to an exact science. There\r\nwas a rough and ready rule-of-thumb test of truth, and a number of\r\nrules as regards exceptions which could be mastered without much\r\ntrouble, yet there was a residue of cases in which decision was\r\ndifficult\xe2\x80\x94so difficult that a man had better follow his instinct than\r\nattempt to decide them by any process of reasoning.\r\n\r\nInstinct then is the ultimate court of appeal. And what is instinct? It\r\nis a mode of faith in the evidence of things not actually seen. And so\r\nmy hero returned almost to the point from which he had started\r\noriginally, namely that the just shall live by faith.\r\n\r\nAnd this is what the just\xe2\x80\x94that is to say reasonable people\xe2\x80\x94do as\r\nregards those daily affairs of life which most concern them. They\r\nsettle smaller matters by the exercise of their own deliberation. More\r\nimportant ones, such as the cure of their own bodies and the bodies of\r\nthose whom they love, the investment of their money, the extrication of\r\ntheir affairs from any serious mess\xe2\x80\x94these things they generally entrust\r\nto others of whose capacity they know little save from general report;\r\nthey act therefore on the strength of faith, not of knowledge. So the\r\nEnglish nation entrusts the welfare of its fleet and naval defences to\r\na First Lord of the Admiralty, who, not being a sailor can know nothing\r\nabout these matters except by acts of faith. There can be no doubt\r\nabout faith and not reason being the _ultima ratio_.\r\n\r\nEven Euclid, who has laid himself as little open to the charge of\r\ncredulity as any writer who ever lived, cannot get beyond this. He has\r\nno demonstrable first premise. He requires postulates and axioms which\r\ntranscend demonstration, and without which he can do nothing. His\r\nsuperstructure indeed is demonstration, but his ground is faith. Nor\r\nagain can he get further than telling a man he is a fool if he persists\r\nin differing from him. He says \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is absurd,\xe2\x80\x9d and declines to\r\ndiscuss the matter further. Faith and authority, therefore, prove to be\r\nas necessary for him as for anyone else. \xe2\x80\x9cBy faith in what, then,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nasked Ernest of himself, \xe2\x80\x9cshall a just man endeavour to live at this\r\npresent time?\xe2\x80\x9d He answered to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate not by faith in the\r\nsupernatural element of the Christian religion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd how should he best persuade his fellow-countrymen to leave off\r\nbelieving in this supernatural element? Looking at the matter from a\r\npractical point of view he thought the Archbishop of Canterbury\r\nafforded the most promising key to the situation. It lay between him\r\nand the Pope. The Pope was perhaps best in theory, but in practice the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury would do sufficiently well. If he could only\r\nmanage to sprinkle a pinch of salt, as it were, on the Archbishop\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntail, he might convert the whole Church of England to free thought by a\r\n_coup de main_. There must be an amount of cogency which even an\r\nArchbishop\xe2\x80\x94an Archbishop whose perceptions had never been quickened by\r\nimprisonment for assault\xe2\x80\x94would not be able to withstand. When brought\r\nface to face with the facts, as he, Ernest, could arrange them; his\r\nGrace would have no resource but to admit them; being an honourable man\r\nhe would at once resign his Archbishopric, and Christianity would\r\nbecome extinct in England within a few months\xe2\x80\x99 time. This, at any rate,\r\nwas how things ought to be. But all the time Ernest had no confidence\r\nin the Archbishop\xe2\x80\x99s not hopping off just as the pinch was about to fall\r\non him, and this seemed so unfair that his blood boiled at the thought\r\nof it. If this was to be so, he must try if he could not fix him by the\r\njudicious use of bird-lime or a snare, or throw the salt on his tail\r\nfrom an ambuscade.\r\n\r\nTo do him justice it was not himself that he greatly cared about. He\r\nknew he had been humbugged, and he knew also that the greater part of\r\nthe ills which had afflicted him were due, indirectly, in chief measure\r\nto the influence of Christian teaching; still, if the mischief had\r\nended with himself, he should have thought little about it, but there\r\nwas his sister, and his brother Joey, and the hundreds and thousands of\r\nyoung people throughout England whose lives were being blighted through\r\nthe lies told them by people whose business it was to know better, but\r\nwho scamped their work and shirked difficulties instead of facing them.\r\nIt was this which made him think it worth while to be angry, and to\r\nconsider whether he could not at least do something towards saving\r\nothers from such years of waste and misery as he had had to pass\r\nhimself. If there was no truth in the miraculous accounts of Christ\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nDeath and Resurrection, the whole of the religion founded upon the\r\nhistoric truth of those events tumbled to the ground. \xe2\x80\x9cMy,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed, with all the arrogance of youth, \xe2\x80\x9cthey put a gipsy or\r\nfortune-teller into prison for getting money out of silly people who\r\nthink they have supernatural power; why should they not put a clergyman\r\nin prison for pretending that he can absolve sins, or turn bread and\r\nwine into the flesh and blood of One who died two thousand years ago?\r\nWhat,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself, \xe2\x80\x9ccould be more pure \xe2\x80\x98hanky-panky\xe2\x80\x99 than that a\r\nbishop should lay his hands upon a young man and pretend to convey to\r\nhim the spiritual power to work this miracle? It was all very well to\r\ntalk about toleration; toleration, like everything else, had its\r\nlimits; besides, if it was to include the bishop let it include the\r\nfortune-teller too.\xe2\x80\x9d He would explain all this to the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury by and by, but as he could not get hold of him just now, it\r\noccurred to him that he might experimentalise advantageously upon the\r\nviler soul of the prison chaplain. It was only those who took the first\r\nand most obvious step in their power who ever did great things in the\r\nend, so one day, when Mr Hughes\xe2\x80\x94for this was the chaplain\xe2\x80\x99s name\xe2\x80\x94was\r\ntalking with him, Ernest introduced the question of Christian\r\nevidences, and tried to raise a discussion upon them. Mr Hughes had\r\nbeen very kind to him, but he was more than twice my hero\xe2\x80\x99s age, and\r\nhad long taken the measure of such objections as Ernest tried to put\r\nbefore him. I do not suppose he believed in the actual objective truth\r\nof the stories about Christ\xe2\x80\x99s Resurrection and Ascension any more than\r\nErnest did, but he knew that this was a small matter, and that the real\r\nissue lay much deeper than this.\r\n\r\nMr Hughes was a man who had been in authority for many years, and he\r\nbrushed Ernest on one side as if he had been a fly. He did it so well\r\nthat my hero never ventured to tackle him again, and confined his\r\nconversation with him for the future to such matters as what he had\r\nbetter do when he got out of prison; and here Mr Hughes was ever ready\r\nto listen to him with sympathy and kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nErnest was now so far convalescent as to be able to sit up for the\r\ngreater part of the day. He had been three months in prison, and,\r\nthough not strong enough to leave the infirmary, was beyond all fear of\r\na relapse. He was talking one day with Mr Hughes about his future, and\r\nagain expressed his intention of emigrating to Australia or New Zealand\r\nwith the money he should recover from Pryer. Whenever he spoke of this\r\nhe noticed that Mr Hughes looked grave and was silent: he had thought\r\nthat perhaps the chaplain wanted him to return to his profession, and\r\ndisapproved of his evident anxiety to turn to something else; now,\r\nhowever, he asked Mr Hughes point blank why it was that he disapproved\r\nof his idea of emigrating.\r\n\r\nMr Hughes endeavoured to evade him, but Ernest was not to be put off.\r\nThere was something in the chaplain\xe2\x80\x99s manner which suggested that he\r\nknew more than Ernest did, but did not like to say it. This alarmed him\r\nso much that he begged him not to keep him in suspense; after a little\r\nhesitation Mr Hughes, thinking him now strong enough to stand it, broke\r\nthe news as gently as he could that the whole of Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s money had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe day after my return from Battersby I called on my solicitor, and\r\nwas told that he had written to Pryer, requiring him to refund the\r\nmonies for which he had given his I.O.U.\xe2\x80\x99s. Pryer replied that he had\r\ngiven orders to his broker to close his operations, which unfortunately\r\nhad resulted so far in heavy loss, and that the balance should be paid\r\nto my solicitor on the following settling day, then about a week\r\ndistant. When the time came, we heard nothing from Pryer, and going to\r\nhis lodgings found that he had left with his few effects on the very\r\nday after he had heard from us, and had not been seen since.\r\n\r\nI had heard from Ernest the name of the broker who had been employed,\r\nand went at once to see him. He told me Pryer had closed all his\r\naccounts for cash on the day that Ernest had been sentenced, and had\r\nreceived \xc2\xa32315, which was all that remained of Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s original \xc2\xa35000.\r\nWith this he had decamped, nor had we enough clue as to his whereabouts\r\nto be able to take any steps to recover the money. There was in fact\r\nnothing to be done but to consider the whole as lost. I may say here\r\nthat neither I nor Ernest ever heard of Pryer again, nor have any idea\r\nwhat became of him.\r\n\r\nThis placed me in a difficult position. I knew, of course, that in a\r\nfew years Ernest would have many times over as much money as he had\r\nlost, but I knew also that he did not know this, and feared that the\r\nsupposed loss of all he had in the world might be more than he could\r\nstand when coupled with his other misfortunes.\r\n\r\nThe prison authorities had found Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s address from a letter in\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x99s pocket, and had communicated with him more than once\r\nconcerning his son\xe2\x80\x99s illness, but Theobald had not written to me, and I\r\nsupposed my godson to be in good health. He would be just twenty-four\r\nyears old when he left prison, and if I followed out his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninstructions, would have to battle with fortune for another four years\r\nas well as he could. The question before me was whether it was right to\r\nlet him run so much risk, or whether I should not to some extent\r\ntransgress my instructions\xe2\x80\x94which there was nothing to prevent my doing\r\nif I thought Miss Pontifex would have wished it\xe2\x80\x94and let him have the\r\nsame sum that he would have recovered from Pryer.\r\n\r\nIf my godson had been an older man, and more fixed in any definite\r\ngroove, this is what I should have done, but he was still very young,\r\nand more than commonly unformed for his age. If, again, I had known of\r\nhis illness I should not have dared to lay any heavier burden on his\r\nback than he had to bear already; but not being uneasy about his\r\nhealth, I thought a few years of roughing it and of experience\r\nconcerning the importance of not playing tricks with money would do him\r\nno harm. So I decided to keep a sharp eye upon him as soon as he came\r\nout of prison, and to let him splash about in deep water as best he\r\ncould till I saw whether he was able to swim, or was about to sink. In\r\nthe first case I would let him go on swimming till he was nearly\r\neight-and-twenty, when I would prepare him gradually for the good\r\nfortune that awaited him; in the second I would hurry up to the rescue.\r\nSo I wrote to say that Pryer had absconded, and that he could have \xc2\xa3100\r\nfrom his father when he came out of prison. I then waited to see what\r\neffect these tidings would have, not expecting to receive an answer for\r\nthree months, for I had been told on enquiry that no letter could be\r\nreceived by a prisoner till after he had been three months in gaol. I\r\nalso wrote to Theobald and told him of Pryer\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, when my letter arrived the governor of the gaol\r\nread it, and in a case of such importance would have relaxed the rules\r\nif Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s state had allowed it; his illness prevented this, and the\r\ngovernor left it to the chaplain and the doctor to break the news to\r\nhim when they thought him strong enough to bear it, which was now the\r\ncase. In the meantime I received a formal official document saying that\r\nmy letter had been received and would be communicated to the prisoner\r\nin due course; I believe it was simply through a mistake on the part of\r\na clerk that I was not informed of Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s illness, but I heard\r\nnothing of it till I saw him by his own desire a few days after the\r\nchaplin had broken to him the substance of what I had written.\r\n\r\nErnest was terribly shocked when he heard of the loss of his money, but\r\nhis ignorance of the world prevented him from seeing the full extent of\r\nthe mischief. He had never been in serious want of money yet, and did\r\nnot know what it meant. In reality, money losses are the hardest to\r\nbear of any by those who are old enough to comprehend them.\r\n\r\nA man can stand being told that he must submit to a severe surgical\r\noperation, or that he has some disease which will shortly kill him, or\r\nthat he will be a cripple or blind for the rest of his life; dreadful\r\nas such tidings must be, we do not find that they unnerve the greater\r\nnumber of mankind; most men, indeed, go coolly enough even to be\r\nhanged, but the strongest quail before financial ruin, and the better\r\nmen they are, the more complete, as a general rule, is their\r\nprostration. Suicide is a common consequence of money losses; it is\r\nrarely sought as a means of escape from bodily suffering. If we feel\r\nthat we have a competence at our backs, so that we can die warm and\r\nquietly in our beds, with no need to worry about expense, we live our\r\nlives out to the dregs, no matter how excruciating our torments. Job\r\nprobably felt the loss of his flocks and herds more than that of his\r\nwife and family, for he could enjoy his flocks and herds without his\r\nfamily, but not his family\xe2\x80\x94not for long\xe2\x80\x94if he had lost all his money.\r\nLoss of money indeed is not only the worst pain in itself, but it is\r\nthe parent of all others. Let a man have been brought up to a moderate\r\ncompetence, and have no specially; then let his money be suddenly taken\r\nfrom him, and how long is his health likely to survive the change in\r\nall his little ways which loss of money will entail? How long again is\r\nthe esteem and sympathy of friends likely to survive ruin? People may\r\nbe very sorry for us, but their attitude towards us hitherto has been\r\nbased upon the supposition that we were situated thus or thus in money\r\nmatters; when this breaks down there must be a restatement of the\r\nsocial problem so far as we are concerned; we have been obtaining\r\nesteem under false pretences. Granted, then, that the three most\r\nserious losses which a man can suffer are those affecting money, health\r\nand reputation. Loss of money is far the worst, then comes ill-health,\r\nand then loss of reputation; loss of reputation is a bad third, for, if\r\na man keeps health and money unimpaired, it will be generally found\r\nthat his loss of reputation is due to breaches of parvenu conventions\r\nonly, and not to violations of those older, better established canons\r\nwhose authority is unquestionable. In this case a man may grow a new\r\nreputation as easily as a lobster grows a new claw, or, if he have\r\nhealth and money, may thrive in great peace of mind without any\r\nreputation at all. The only chance for a man who has lost his money is\r\nthat he shall still be young enough to stand uprooting and\r\ntransplanting without more than temporary derangement, and this I\r\nbelieved my godson still to be.\r\n\r\nBy the prison rules he might receive and send a letter after he had\r\nbeen in gaol three months, and might also receive one visit from a\r\nfriend. When he received my letter, he at once asked me to come and see\r\nhim, which of course I did. I found him very much changed, and still so\r\nfeeble, that the exertion of coming from the infirmary to the cell in\r\nwhich I was allowed to see him, and the agitation of seeing me were too\r\nmuch for him. At first he quite broke down, and I was so pained at the\r\nstate in which I found him, that I was on the point of breaking my\r\ninstructions then and there. I contented myself, however, for the time,\r\nwith assuring him that I would help him as soon as he came out of\r\nprison, and that, when he had made up his mind what he would do, he was\r\nto come to me for what money might be necessary, if he could not get it\r\nfrom his father. To make it easier for him I told him that his aunt, on\r\nher death-bed, had desired me to do something of this sort should an\r\nemergency arise, so that he would only be taking what his aunt had left\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI will not take the \xc2\xa3100 from my father, and I will\r\nnever see him or my mother again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cTake the \xc2\xa3100, Ernest, and as much more as you can get, and\r\nthen do not see them again if you do not like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis Ernest would not do. If he took money from them, he could not cut\r\nthem, and he wanted to cut them. I thought my godson would get on a\r\ngreat deal better if he would only have the firmness to do as he\r\nproposed, as regards breaking completely with his father and mother,\r\nand said so. \xe2\x80\x9cThen don\xe2\x80\x99t you like them?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a look of\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike them!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI think they\xe2\x80\x99re horrid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s the kindest thing of all you have done for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought all\xe2\x80\x94all middle-aged people liked my father and\r\nmother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had been about to call me old, but I was only fifty-seven, and was\r\nnot going to have this, so I made a face when I saw him hesitating,\r\nwhich drove him into \xe2\x80\x9cmiddle-aged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI will say all your family are horrid except\r\nyourself and your aunt Alethea. The greater part of every family is\r\nalways odious; if there are one or two good ones in a very large\r\nfamily, it is as much as can be expected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, gratefully, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I can now stand almost\r\nanything. I will come and see you as soon as I come out of gaol.\r\nGood-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d For the warder had told us that the time allowed for our\r\ninterview was at an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as Ernest found that he had no money to look to upon leaving\r\nprison he saw that his dreams about emigrating and farming must come to\r\nan end, for he knew that he was incapable of working at the plough or\r\nwith the axe for long together himself. And now it seemed he should\r\nhave no money to pay any one else for doing so. It was this that\r\nresolved him to part once and for all with his parents. If he had been\r\ngoing abroad he could have kept up relations with them, for they would\r\nhave been too far off to interfere with him.\r\n\r\nHe knew his father and mother would object to being cut; they would\r\nwish to appear kind and forgiving; they would also dislike having no\r\nfurther power to plague him; but he knew also very well that so long as\r\nhe and they ran in harness together they would be always pulling one\r\nway and he another. He wanted to drop the gentleman and go down into\r\nthe ranks, beginning on the lowest rung of the ladder, where no one\r\nwould know of his disgrace or mind it if he did know; his father and\r\nmother on the other hand would wish him to clutch on to the fag-end of\r\ngentility at a starvation salary and with no prospect of advancement.\r\nErnest had seen enough in Ashpit Place to know that a tailor, if he did\r\nnot drink and attended to his business, could earn more money than a\r\nclerk or a curate, while much less expense by way of show was required\r\nof him. The tailor also had more liberty, and a better chance of\r\nrising. Ernest resolved at once, as he had fallen so far, to fall still\r\nlower\xe2\x80\x94promptly, gracefully and with the idea of rising again, rather\r\nthan cling to the skirts of a respectability which would permit him to\r\nexist on sufferance only, and make him pay an utterly extortionate\r\nprice for an article which he could do better without.\r\n\r\nHe arrived at this result more quickly than he might otherwise have\r\ndone through remembering something he had once heard his aunt say about\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ckissing the soil.\xe2\x80\x9d This had impressed him and stuck by him perhaps by\r\nreason of its brevity; when later on he came to know the story of\r\nHercules and Ant\xc3\xa6us, he found it one of the very few ancient fables\r\nwhich had a hold over him\xe2\x80\x94his chiefest debt to classical literature.\r\nHis aunt had wanted him to learn carpentering, as a means of kissing\r\nthe soil should his Hercules ever throw him. It was too late for this\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94or he thought it was\xe2\x80\x94but the mode of carrying out his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s idea\r\nwas a detail; there were a hundred ways of kissing the soil besides\r\nbecoming a carpenter.\r\n\r\nHe had told me this during our interview, and I had encouraged him to\r\nthe utmost of my power. He showed so much more good sense than I had\r\ngiven him credit for that I became comparatively easy about him, and\r\ndetermined to let him play his own game, being always, however, ready\r\nto hand in case things went too far wrong. It was not simply because he\r\ndisliked his father and mother that he wanted to have no more to do\r\nwith them; if it had been only this he would have put up with them; but\r\na warning voice within told him distinctly enough that if he was clean\r\ncut away from them he might still have a chance of success, whereas if\r\nthey had anything whatever to do with him, or even knew where he was,\r\nthey would hamper him and in the end ruin him. Absolute independence he\r\nbelieved to be his only chance of very life itself.\r\n\r\nOver and above this\xe2\x80\x94if this were not enough\xe2\x80\x94Ernest had a faith in his\r\nown destiny such as most young men, I suppose, feel, but the grounds of\r\nwhich were not apparent to any one but himself. Rightly or wrongly, in\r\na quiet way he believed he possessed a strength which, if he were only\r\nfree to use it in his own way, might do great things some day. He did\r\nnot know when, nor where, nor how his opportunity was to come, but he\r\nnever doubted that it would come in spite of all that had happened, and\r\nabove all else he cherished the hope that he might know how to seize it\r\nif it came, for whatever it was it would be something that no one else\r\ncould do so well as he could. People said there were no dragons and\r\ngiants for adventurous men to fight with nowadays; it was beginning to\r\ndawn upon him that there were just as many now as at any past time.\r\n\r\nMonstrous as such a faith may seem in one who was qualifying himself\r\nfor a high mission by a term of imprisonment, he could no more help it\r\nthan he could help breathing; it was innate in him, and it was even\r\nmore with a view to this than for other reasons that he wished to sever\r\nthe connection between himself and his parents; for he knew that if\r\never the day came in which it should appear that before him too there\r\nwas a race set in which it might be an honour to have run among the\r\nforemost, his father and mother would be the first to let him and\r\nhinder him in running it. They had been the first to say that he ought\r\nto run such a race; they would also be the first to trip him up if he\r\ntook them at their word, and then afterwards upbraid him for not having\r\nwon. Achievement of any kind would be impossible for him unless he was\r\nfree from those who would be for ever dragging him back into the\r\nconventional. The conventional had been tried already and had been\r\nfound wanting.\r\n\r\nHe had an opportunity now, if he chose to take it, of escaping once for\r\nall from those who at once tormented him and would hold him earthward\r\nshould a chance of soaring open before him. He should never have had it\r\nbut for his imprisonment; but for this the force of habit and routine\r\nwould have been too strong for him; he should hardly have had it if he\r\nhad not lost all his money; the gap would not have been so wide but\r\nthat he might have been inclined to throw a plank across it. He\r\nrejoiced now, therefore, over his loss of money as well as over his\r\nimprisonment, which had made it more easy for him to follow his truest\r\nand most lasting interests.\r\n\r\nAt times he wavered, when he thought of how his mother, who in her way,\r\nas he thought, had loved him, would weep and think sadly over him, or\r\nhow perhaps she might even fall ill and die, and how the blame would\r\nrest with him. At these times his resolution was near breaking, but\r\nwhen he found I applauded his design, the voice within, which bade him\r\nsee his father\xe2\x80\x99s and mother\xe2\x80\x99s faces no more, grew louder and more\r\npersistent. If he could not cut himself adrift from those who he knew\r\nwould hamper him, when so small an effort was wanted, his dream of a\r\ndestiny was idle; what was the prospect of a hundred pounds from his\r\nfather in comparison with jeopardy to this? He still felt deeply the\r\npain his disgrace had inflicted upon his father and mother, but he was\r\ngetting stronger, and reflected that as he had run his chance with them\r\nfor parents, so they must run theirs with him for a son.\r\n\r\nHe had nearly settled down to this conclusion when he received a letter\r\nfrom his father which made his decision final. If the prison rules had\r\nbeen interpreted strictly, he would not have been allowed to have this\r\nletter for another three months, as he had already heard from me, but\r\nthe governor took a lenient view, and considered the letter from me to\r\nbe a business communication hardly coming under the category of a\r\nletter from friends. Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s letter therefore was given to his son.\r\nIt ran as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Ernest, My object in writing is not to upbraid you with the\r\ndisgrace and shame you have inflicted upon your mother and myself, to\r\nsay nothing of your brother Joey, and your sister. Suffer of course we\r\nmust, but we know to whom to look in our affliction, and are filled\r\nwith anxiety rather on your behalf than our own. Your mother is\r\nwonderful. She is pretty well in health, and desires me to send you her\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you considered your prospects on leaving prison? I understand\r\nfrom Mr Overton that you have lost the legacy which your grandfather\r\nleft you, together with all the interest that accrued during your\r\nminority, in the course of speculation upon the Stock Exchange! If you\r\nhave indeed been guilty of such appalling folly it is difficult to see\r\nwhat you can turn your hand to, and I suppose you will try to find a\r\nclerkship in an office. Your salary will doubtless be low at first, but\r\nyou have made your bed and must not complain if you have to lie upon\r\nit. If you take pains to please your employers they will not be\r\nbackward in promoting you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I first heard from Mr Overton of the unspeakable calamity which\r\nhad befallen your mother and myself, I had resolved not to see you\r\nagain. I am unwilling, however, to have recourse to a measure which\r\nwould deprive you of your last connecting link with respectable people.\r\nYour mother and I will see you as soon as you come out of prison; not\r\nat Battersby\xe2\x80\x94we do not wish you to come down here at present\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nsomewhere else, probably in London. You need not shrink from seeing us;\r\nwe shall not reproach you. We will then decide about your future.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt present our impression is that you will find a fairer start\r\nprobably in Australia or New Zealand than here, and I am prepared to\r\nfind you \xc2\xa375 or even if necessary so far as \xc2\xa3100 to pay your passage\r\nmoney. Once in the colony you must be dependent upon your own\r\nexertions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay Heaven prosper them and you, and restore you to us years hence a\r\nrespected member of society.\xe2\x80\x94Your affectionate father,\r\n\r\n\r\nT. PONTIFEX.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen there was a postscript in Christina\xe2\x80\x99s writing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling, darling boy, pray with me daily and hourly that we may yet\r\nagain become a happy, united, God-fearing family as we were before this\r\nhorrible pain fell upon us.\xe2\x80\x94Your sorrowing but ever loving mother,\r\n\r\n\r\nC. P.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis letter did not produce the effect on Ernest that it would have\r\ndone before his imprisonment began. His father and mother thought they\r\ncould take him up as they had left him off. They forgot the rapidity\r\nwith which development follows misfortune, if the sufferer is young and\r\nof a sound temperament. Ernest made no reply to his father\xe2\x80\x99s letter,\r\nbut his desire for a total break developed into something like a\r\npassion. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are orphanages,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cfor children\r\nwho have lost their parents\xe2\x80\x94oh! why, why, why, are there no harbours of\r\nrefuge for grown men who have not yet lost them?\xe2\x80\x9d And he brooded over\r\nthe bliss of Melchisedek who had been born an orphan, without father,\r\nwithout mother, and without descent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I think over all that Ernest told me about his prison meditations,\r\nand the conclusions he was drawn to, it occurs to me that in reality he\r\nwas wanting to do the very last thing which it would have entered into\r\nhis head to think of wanting. I mean that he was trying to give up\r\nfather and mother for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake. He would have said he was giving\r\nthem up because he thought they hindered him in the pursuit of his\r\ntruest and most lasting happiness. Granted, but what is this if it is\r\nnot Christ? What is Christ if He is not this? He who takes the highest\r\nand most self-respecting view of his own welfare which it is in his\r\npower to conceive, and adheres to it in spite of conventionality, is a\r\nChristian whether he knows it and calls himself one, or whether he does\r\nnot. A rose is not the less a rose because it does not know its own\r\nname.\r\n\r\nWhat if circumstances had made his duty more easy for him than it would\r\nbe to most men? That was his luck, as much as it is other people\xe2\x80\x99s luck\r\nto have other duties made easy for them by accident of birth. Surely if\r\npeople are born rich or handsome they have a right to their good\r\nfortune. Some I know, will say that one man has no right to be born\r\nwith a better constitution than another; others again will say that\r\nluck is the only righteous object of human veneration. Both, I daresay,\r\ncan make out a very good case, but whichever may be right surely Ernest\r\nhad as much right to the good luck of finding a duty made easier as he\r\nhad had to the bad fortune of falling into the scrape which had got him\r\ninto prison. A man is not to be sneered at for having a trump card in\r\nhis hand; he is only to be sneered at if he plays his trump card badly.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I question whether it is ever much harder for anyone to give up\r\nfather and mother for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake than it was for Ernest. The\r\nrelations between the parties will have almost always been severely\r\nstrained before it comes to this. I doubt whether anyone was ever yet\r\nrequired to give up those to whom he was tenderly attached for a mere\r\nmatter of conscience: he will have ceased to be tenderly attached to\r\nthem long before he is called upon to break with them; for differences\r\nof opinion concerning any matter of vital importance spring from\r\ndifferences of constitution, and these will already have led to so much\r\nother disagreement that the \xe2\x80\x9cgiving up\xe2\x80\x9d when it comes, is like giving\r\nup an aching but very loose and hollow tooth. It is the loss of those\r\nwhom we are not required to give up for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake which is really\r\npainful to us. Then there is a wrench in earnest. Happily, no matter\r\nhow light the task that is demanded from us, it is enough if we do it;\r\nwe reap our reward, much as though it were a Herculean labour.\r\n\r\nBut to return, the conclusion Ernest came to was that he would be a\r\ntailor. He talked the matter over with the chaplain, who told him there\r\nwas no reason why he should not be able to earn his six or seven\r\nshillings a day by the time he came out of prison, if he chose to learn\r\nthe trade during the remainder of his term\xe2\x80\x94not quite three months; the\r\ndoctor said he was strong enough for this, and that it was about the\r\nonly thing he was as yet fit for; so he left the infirmary sooner than\r\nhe would otherwise have done and entered the tailor\xe2\x80\x99s shop, overjoyed\r\nat the thoughts of seeing his way again, and confident of rising some\r\nday if he could only get a firm foothold to start from.\r\n\r\nEveryone whom he had to do with saw that he did not belong to what are\r\ncalled the criminal classes, and finding him eager to learn and to save\r\ntrouble always treated him kindly and almost respectfully. He did not\r\nfind the work irksome: it was far more pleasant than making Latin and\r\nGreek verses at Roughborough; he felt that he would rather be here in\r\nprison than at Roughborough again\xe2\x80\x94yes, or even at Cambridge itself. The\r\nonly trouble he was ever in danger of getting into was through\r\nexchanging words or looks with the more decent-looking of his\r\nfellow-prisoners. This was forbidden, but he never missed a chance of\r\nbreaking the rules in this respect.\r\n\r\nAny man of his ability who was at the same time anxious to learn would\r\nof course make rapid progress, and before he left prison the warder\r\nsaid he was as good a tailor with his three months\xe2\x80\x99 apprenticeship as\r\nmany a man was with twelve. Ernest had never before been so much\r\npraised by any of his teachers. Each day as he grew stronger in health\r\nand more accustomed to his surroundings he saw some fresh advantage in\r\nhis position, an advantage which he had not aimed at, but which had\r\ncome almost in spite of himself, and he marvelled at his own good\r\nfortune, which had ordered things so greatly better for him than he\r\ncould have ordered them for himself.\r\n\r\nHis having lived six months in Ashpit Place was a case in point. Things\r\nwere possible to him which to others like him would be impossible. If\r\nsuch a man as Towneley were told he must live henceforth in a house\r\nlike those in Ashpit Place it would be more than he could stand. Ernest\r\ncould not have stood it himself if he had gone to live there of\r\ncompulsion through want of money. It was only because he had felt\r\nhimself able to run away at any minute that he had not wanted to do so;\r\nnow, however, that he had become familiar with life in Ashpit Place he\r\nno longer minded it, and could live gladly in lower parts of London\r\nthan that so long as he could pay his way. It was from no prudence or\r\nforethought that he had served this apprenticeship to life among the\r\npoor. He had been trying in a feeble way to be thorough in his work: he\r\nhad not been thorough, the whole thing had been a _fiasco_; but he had\r\nmade a little puny effort in the direction of being genuine, and\r\nbehold, in his hour of need it had been returned to him with a reward\r\nfar richer than he had deserved. He could not have faced becoming one\r\nof the very poor unless he had had such a bridge to conduct him over to\r\nthem as he had found unwittingly in Ashpit Place. True, there had been\r\ndrawbacks in the particular house he had chosen, but he need not live\r\nin a house where there was a Mr Holt and he should no longer be tied to\r\nthe profession which he so much hated; if there were neither screams\r\nnor scripture readings he could be happy in a garret at three shillings\r\na week, such as Miss Maitland lived in.\r\n\r\nAs he thought further he remembered that all things work together for\r\ngood to them that love God; was it possible, he asked himself, that he\r\ntoo, however imperfectly, had been trying to love him? He dared not\r\nanswer Yes, but he would try hard that it should be so. Then there came\r\ninto his mind that noble air of Handel\xe2\x80\x99s: \xe2\x80\x9cGreat God, who yet but\r\ndarkly known,\xe2\x80\x9d and he felt it as he had never felt it before. He had\r\nlost his faith in Christianity, but his faith in something\xe2\x80\x94he knew not\r\nwhat, but that there was a something as yet but darkly known which made\r\nright right and wrong wrong\xe2\x80\x94his faith in this grew stronger and\r\nstronger daily.\r\n\r\nAgain there crossed his mind thoughts of the power which he felt to be\r\nin him, and of how and where it was to find its vent. The same instinct\r\nwhich had led him to live among the poor because it was the nearest\r\nthing to him which he could lay hold of with any clearness came to his\r\nassistance here too. He thought of the Australian gold and how those\r\nwho lived among it had never seen it though it abounded all around\r\nthem: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is gold everywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed inwardly, \xe2\x80\x9cto those who\r\nlook for it.\xe2\x80\x9d Might not his opportunity be close upon him if he looked\r\ncarefully enough at his immediate surroundings? What was his position?\r\nHe had lost all. Could he not turn his having lost all into an\r\nopportunity? Might he not, if he too sought the strength of the Lord,\r\nfind, like St Paul, that it was perfected in weakness?\r\n\r\nHe had nothing more to lose; money, friends, character, all were gone\r\nfor a very long time if not for ever; but there was something else also\r\nthat had taken its flight along with these. I mean the fear of that\r\nwhich man could do unto him. _Cantabil vacuus_. Who could hurt him more\r\nthan he had been hurt already? Let him but be able to earn his bread,\r\nand he knew of nothing which he dared not venture if it would make the\r\nworld a happier place for those who were young and loveable. Herein he\r\nfound so much comfort that he almost wished he had lost his reputation\r\neven more completely\xe2\x80\x94for he saw that it was like a man\xe2\x80\x99s life which may\r\nbe found of them that lose it and lost of them that would find it. He\r\nshould not have had the courage to give up all for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake, but\r\nnow Christ had mercifully taken all, and lo! it seemed as though all\r\nwere found.\r\n\r\nAs the days went slowly by he came to see that Christianity and the\r\ndenial of Christianity after all met as much as any other extremes do;\r\nit was a fight about names\xe2\x80\x94not about things; practically the Church of\r\nRome, the Church of England, and the freethinker have the same ideal\r\nstandard and meet in the gentleman; for he is the most perfect saint\r\nwho is the most perfect gentleman. Then he saw also that it matters\r\nlittle what profession, whether of religion or irreligion, a man may\r\nmake, provided only he follows it out with charitable inconsistency,\r\nand without insisting on it to the bitter end. It is in the\r\nuncompromisingness with which dogma is held and not in the dogma or\r\nwant of dogma that the danger lies. This was the crowning point of the\r\nedifice; when he had got here he no longer wished to molest even the\r\nPope. The Archbishop of Canterbury might have hopped about all round\r\nhim and even picked crumbs out of his hand without running risk of\r\ngetting a sly sprinkle of salt. That wary prelate himself might perhaps\r\nhave been of a different opinion, but the robins and thrushes that hop\r\nabout our lawns are not more needlessly distrustful of the hand that\r\nthrows them out crumbs of bread in winter, than the Archbishop would\r\nhave been of my hero.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he was helped to arrive at the foregoing conclusion by an event\r\nwhich almost thrust inconsistency upon him. A few days after he had\r\nleft the infirmary the chaplain came to his cell and told him that the\r\nprisoner who played the organ in chapel had just finished his sentence\r\nand was leaving the prison; he therefore offered the post to Ernest,\r\nwho he already knew played the organ. Ernest was at first in doubt\r\nwhether it would be right for him to assist at religious services more\r\nthan he was actually compelled to do, but the pleasure of playing the\r\norgan, and the privileges which the post involved, made him see\r\nexcellent reasons for not riding consistency to death. Having, then,\r\nonce introduced an element of inconsistency into his system, he was far\r\ntoo consistent not to be inconsistent consistently, and he lapsed ere\r\nlong into an amiable indifferentism which to outward appearance\r\ndiffered but little from the indifferentism from which Mr Hawke had\r\naroused him.\r\n\r\nBy becoming organist he was saved from the treadmill, for which the\r\ndoctor had said he was unfit as yet, but which he would probably have\r\nbeen put to in due course as soon as he was stronger. He might have\r\nescaped the tailor\xe2\x80\x99s shop altogether and done only the comparatively\r\nlight work of attending to the chaplain\xe2\x80\x99s rooms if he had liked, but he\r\nwanted to learn as much tailoring as he could, and did not therefore\r\ntake advantage of this offer; he was allowed, however, two hours a day\r\nin the afternoon for practice. From that moment his prison life ceased\r\nto be monotonous, and the remaining two months of his sentence slipped\r\nby almost as rapidly as they would have done if he had been free. What\r\nwith music, books, learning his trade, and conversation with the\r\nchaplain, who was just the kindly, sensible person that Ernest wanted\r\nin order to steady him a little, the days went by so pleasantly that\r\nwhen the time came for him to leave prison, he did so, or thought he\r\ndid so, not without regret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nIn coming to the conclusion that he would sever the connection between\r\nhimself and his family once for all Ernest had reckoned without his\r\nfamily. Theobald wanted to be rid of his son, it is true, in so far as\r\nhe wished him to be no nearer at any rate than the Antipodes; but he\r\nhad no idea of entirely breaking with him. He knew his son well enough\r\nto have a pretty shrewd idea that this was what Ernest would wish\r\nhimself, and perhaps as much for this reason as for any other he was\r\ndetermined to keep up the connection, provided it did not involve\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x99s coming to Battersby nor any recurring outlay.\r\n\r\nWhen the time approached for him to leave prison, his father and mother\r\nconsulted as to what course they should adopt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must never leave him to himself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Theobald impressively; \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\ncan neither of us wish that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no! no! dearest Theobald,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Christina. \xe2\x80\x9cWhoever else\r\ndeserts him, and however distant he may be from us, he must still feel\r\nthat he has parents whose hearts beat with affection for him no matter\r\nhow cruelly he has pained them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been his own worst enemy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Theobald. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has never loved\r\nus as we deserved, and now he will be withheld by false shame from\r\nwishing to see us. He will avoid us if he can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we must go to him ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether he likes\r\nit or not we must be at his side to support him as he enters again upon\r\nthe world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we do not want him to give us the slip we must catch him as he\r\nleaves prison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will, we will; our faces shall be the first to gladden his eyes as\r\nhe comes out, and our voices the first to exhort him to return to the\r\npaths of virtue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Theobald, \xe2\x80\x9cif he sees us in the street he will turn\r\nround and run away from us. He is intensely selfish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we must get leave to go inside the prison, and see him before he\r\ngets outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a good deal of discussion this was the plan they decided on\r\nadopting, and having so decided, Theobald wrote to the governor of the\r\ngaol asking whether he could be admitted inside the gaol to receive\r\nErnest when his sentence had expired. He received answer in the\r\naffirmative, and the pair left Battersby the day before Ernest was to\r\ncome out of prison.\r\n\r\nErnest had not reckoned on this, and was rather surprised on being told\r\na few minutes before nine that he was to go into the receiving room\r\nbefore he left the prison as there were visitors waiting to see him.\r\nHis heart fell, for he guessed who they were, but he screwed up his\r\ncourage and hastened to the receiving room. There, sure enough,\r\nstanding at the end of the table nearest the door were the two people\r\nwhom he regarded as the most dangerous enemies he had in all the\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x94his father and mother.\r\n\r\nHe could not fly, but he knew that if he wavered he was lost.\r\n\r\nHis mother was crying, but she sprang forward to meet him and clasped\r\nhim in her arms. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my boy, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d she sobbed, and she could say no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nErnest was as white as a sheet. His heart beat so that he could hardly\r\nbreathe. He let his mother embrace him, and then withdrawing himself\r\nstood silently before her with the tears falling from his eyes.\r\n\r\nAt first he could not speak. For a minute or so the silence on all\r\nsides was complete. Then, gathering strength, he said in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother,\xe2\x80\x9d (it was the first time he had called her anything but\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmamma\xe2\x80\x9d?) \xe2\x80\x9cwe must part.\xe2\x80\x9d On this, turning to the warder, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nbelieve I am free to leave the prison if I wish to do so. You cannot\r\ncompel me to remain here longer. Please take me to the gates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheobald stepped forward. \xe2\x80\x9cErnest, you must not, shall not, leave us in\r\nthis way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not speak to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ernest, his eyes flashing with a fire that\r\nwas unwonted in them. Another warder then came up and took Theobald\r\naside, while the first conducted Ernest to the gates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ernest, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom me that they must think of me as one\r\ndead, for I am dead to them. Say that my greatest pain is the thought\r\nof the disgrace I have inflicted upon them, and that above all things\r\nelse I will study to avoid paining them hereafter; but say also that if\r\nthey write to me I will return their letters unopened, and that if they\r\ncome and see me I will protect myself in whatever way I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time he was at the prison gate, and in another moment was at\r\nliberty. After he had got a few steps out he turned his face to the\r\nprison wall, leant against it for support, and wept as though his heart\r\nwould break.\r\n\r\nGiving up father and mother for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake was not such an easy\r\nmatter after all. If a man has been possessed by devils for long enough\r\nthey will rend him as they leave him, however imperatively they may\r\nhave been cast out. Ernest did not stay long where he was, for he\r\nfeared each moment that his father and mother would come out. He pulled\r\nhimself together and turned into the labyrinth of small streets which\r\nopened out in front of him.\r\n\r\nHe had crossed his Rubicon\xe2\x80\x94not perhaps very heroically or dramatically,\r\nbut then it is only in dramas that people act dramatically. At any\r\nrate, by hook or by crook, he had scrambled over, and was out upon the\r\nother side. Already he thought of much which he would gladly have said,\r\nand blamed his want of presence of mind; but, after all, it mattered\r\nvery little. Inclined though he was to make very great allowances for\r\nhis father and mother, he was indignant at their having thrust\r\nthemselves upon him without warning at a moment when the excitement of\r\nleaving prison was already as much as he was fit for. It was a mean\r\nadvantage to have taken over him, but he was glad they had taken it,\r\nfor it made him realise more fully than ever that his one chance lay in\r\nseparating himself completely from them.\r\n\r\nThe morning was grey, and the first signs of winter fog were beginning\r\nto show themselves, for it was now the 30th of September. Ernest wore\r\nthe clothes in which he had entered prison, and was therefore dressed\r\nas a clergyman. No one who looked at him would have seen any difference\r\nbetween his present appearance and his appearance six months\r\npreviously; indeed, as he walked slowly through the dingy crowded lane\r\ncalled Eyre Street Hill (which he well knew, for he had clerical\r\nfriends in that neighbourhood), the months he had passed in prison\r\nseemed to drop out of his life, and so powerfully did association carry\r\nhim away that, finding himself in his old dress and in his old\r\nsurroundings, he felt dragged back into his old self\xe2\x80\x94as though his six\r\nmonths of prison life had been a dream from which he was now waking to\r\ntake things up as he had left them. This was the effect of unchanged\r\nsurroundings upon the unchanged part of him. But there was a changed\r\npart, and the effect of unchanged surroundings upon this was to make\r\neverything seem almost as strange as though he had never had any life\r\nbut his prison one, and was now born into a new world.\r\n\r\nAll our lives long, every day and every hour, we are engaged in the\r\nprocess of accommodating our changed and unchanged selves to changed\r\nand unchanged surroundings; living, in fact, in nothing else than this\r\nprocess of accommodation; when we fail in it a little we are stupid,\r\nwhen we fail flagrantly we are mad, when we suspend it temporarily we\r\nsleep, when we give up the attempt altogether we die. In quiet,\r\nuneventful lives the changes internal and external are so small that\r\nthere is little or no strain in the process of fusion and\r\naccommodation; in other lives there is great strain, but there is also\r\ngreat fusing and accommodating power; in others great strain with\r\nlittle accommodating power. A life will be successful or not according\r\nas the power of accommodation is equal to or unequal to the strain of\r\nfusing and adjusting internal and external changes.\r\n\r\nThe trouble is that in the end we shall be driven to admit the unity of\r\nthe universe so completely as to be compelled to deny that there is\r\neither an external or an internal, but must see everything both as\r\nexternal and internal at one and the same time, subject and\r\nobject\xe2\x80\x94external and internal\xe2\x80\x94being unified as much as everything else.\r\nThis will knock our whole system over, but then every system has got to\r\nbe knocked over by something.\r\n\r\nMuch the best way out of this difficulty is to go in for separation\r\nbetween internal and external\xe2\x80\x94subject and object\xe2\x80\x94when we find this\r\nconvenient, and unity between the same when we find unity convenient.\r\nThis is illogical, but extremes are alone logical, and they are always\r\nabsurd, the mean is alone practicable and it is always illogical. It is\r\nfaith and not logic which is the supreme arbiter. They say all roads\r\nlead to Rome, and all philosophies that I have ever seen lead\r\nultimately either to some gross absurdity, or else to the conclusion\r\nalready more than once insisted on in these pages, that the just shall\r\nlive by faith, that is to say that sensible people will get through\r\nlife by rule of thumb as they may interpret it most conveniently\r\nwithout asking too many questions for conscience sake. Take any fact,\r\nand reason upon it to the bitter end, and it will ere long lead to this\r\nas the only refuge from some palpable folly.\r\n\r\nBut to return to my story. When Ernest got to the top of the street and\r\nlooked back, he saw the grimy, sullen walls of his prison filling up\r\nthe end of it. He paused for a minute or two. \xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to\r\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x9cI was hemmed in by bolts which I could see and touch; here I\r\nam barred by others which are none the less real\xe2\x80\x94poverty and ignorance\r\nof the world. It was no part of my business to try to break the\r\nmaterial bolts of iron and escape from prison, but now that I am free I\r\nmust surely seek to break these others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had read somewhere of a prisoner who had made his escape by cutting\r\nup his bedstead with an iron spoon. He admired and marvelled at the\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s mind, but could not even try to imitate him; in the presence of\r\nimmaterial barriers, however, he was not so easily daunted, and felt as\r\nthough, even if the bed were iron and the spoon a wooden one, he could\r\nfind some means of making the wood cut the iron sooner or later.\r\n\r\nHe turned his back upon Eyre Street Hill and walked down Leather Lane\r\ninto Holborn. Each step he took, each face or object that he knew,\r\nhelped at once to link him on to the life he had led before his\r\nimprisonment, and at the same time to make him feel how completely that\r\nimprisonment had cut his life into two parts, the one of which could\r\nbear no resemblance to the other.\r\n\r\nHe passed down Fetter Lane into Fleet Street and so to the Temple, to\r\nwhich I had just returned from my summer holiday. It was about half\r\npast nine, and I was having my breakfast, when I heard a timid knock at\r\nthe door and opened it to find Ernest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX\r\n\r\n\r\nI had begun to like him on the night Towneley had sent for me, and on\r\nthe following day I thought he had shaped well. I had liked him also\r\nduring our interview in prison, and wanted to see more of him, so that\r\nI might make up my mind about him. I had lived long enough to know that\r\nsome men who do great things in the end are not very wise when they are\r\nyoung; knowing that he would leave prison on the 30th, I had expected\r\nhim, and, as I had a spare bedroom, pressed him to stay with me, till\r\nhe could make up his mind what he would do.\r\n\r\nBeing so much older than he was, I anticipated no trouble in getting my\r\nown way, but he would not hear of it. The utmost he would assent to was\r\nthat he should be my guest till he could find a room for himself, which\r\nhe would set about doing at once.\r\n\r\nHe was still much agitated, but grew better as he ate a breakfast, not\r\nof prison fare and in a comfortable room. It pleased me to see the\r\ndelight he took in all about him; the fireplace with a fire in it; the\r\neasy chairs, the _Times_, my cat, the red geraniums in the window, to\r\nsay nothing of coffee, bread and butter, sausages, marmalade, etc.\r\nEverything was pregnant with the most exquisite pleasure to him. The\r\nplane trees were full of leaf still; he kept rising from the breakfast\r\ntable to admire them; never till now, he said, had he known what the\r\nenjoyment of these things really was. He ate, looked, laughed and cried\r\nby turns, with an emotion which I can neither forget nor describe.\r\n\r\nHe told me how his father and mother had lain in wait for him, as he\r\nwas about to leave prison. I was furious, and applauded him heartily\r\nfor what he had done. He was very grateful to me for this. Other\r\npeople, he said, would tell him he ought to think of his father and\r\nmother rather than of himself, and it was such a comfort to find\r\nsomeone who saw things as he saw them himself. Even if I had differed\r\nfrom him I should not have said so, but I was of his opinion, and was\r\nalmost as much obliged to him for seeing things as I saw them, as he to\r\nme for doing the same kind office by himself. Cordially as I disliked\r\nTheobald and Christina, I was in such a hopeless minority in the\r\nopinion I had formed concerning them that it was pleasant to find\r\nsomeone who agreed with me.\r\n\r\nThen there came an awful moment for both of us.\r\n\r\nA knock, as of a visitor and not a postman, was heard at my door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness gracious,\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t we sport the oak? Perhaps\r\nit is your father. But surely he would hardly come at this time of day!\r\nGo at once into my bedroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI went to the door, and, sure enough, there were both Theobald and\r\nChristina. I could not refuse to let them in and was obliged to listen\r\nto their version of the story, which agreed substantially with\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x99s. Christina cried bitterly\xe2\x80\x94Theobald stormed. After about ten\r\nminutes, during which I assured them that I had not the faintest\r\nconception where their son was, I dismissed them both. I saw they\r\nlooked suspiciously upon the manifest signs that someone was\r\nbreakfasting with me, and parted from me more or less defiantly, but I\r\ngot rid of them, and poor Ernest came out again, looking white,\r\nfrightened and upset. He had heard voices, but no more, and did not\r\nfeel sure that the enemy might not be gaining over me. We sported the\r\noak now, and before long he began to recover.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, we discussed the situation. I had taken away his\r\nwardrobe and books from Mrs Jupp\xe2\x80\x99s, but had left his furniture,\r\npictures and piano, giving Mrs Jupp the use of these, so that she might\r\nlet her room furnished, in lieu of charge for taking care of the\r\nfurniture. As soon as Ernest heard that his wardrobe was at hand, he\r\ngot out a suit of clothes he had had before he had been ordained, and\r\nput it on at once, much, as I thought, to the improvement of his\r\npersonal appearance.\r\n\r\nThen we went into the subject of his finances. He had had ten pounds\r\nfrom Pryer only a day or two before he was apprehended, of which\r\nbetween seven and eight were in his purse when he entered the prison.\r\nThis money was restored to him on leaving. He had always paid cash for\r\nwhatever he bought, so that there was nothing to be deducted for debts.\r\nBesides this, he had his clothes, books and furniture. He could, as I\r\nhave said, have had \xc2\xa3100 from his father if he had chosen to emigrate,\r\nbut this both Ernest and I (for he brought me round to his opinion)\r\nagreed it would be better to decline. This was all he knew of as\r\nbelonging to him.\r\n\r\nHe said he proposed at once taking an unfurnished top back attic in as\r\nquiet a house as he could find, say at three or four shillings a week,\r\nand looking out for work as a tailor. I did not think it much mattered\r\nwhat he began with, for I felt pretty sure he would ere long find his\r\nway to something that suited him, if he could get a start with anything\r\nat all. The difficulty was how to get him started. It was not enough\r\nthat he should be able to cut out and make clothes\xe2\x80\x94that he should have\r\nthe organs, so to speak, of a tailor; he must be put into a tailor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshop and guided for a little while by someone who knew how and where to\r\nhelp him.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day he spent in looking for a room, which he soon\r\nfound, and in familiarising himself with liberty. In the evening I took\r\nhim to the Olympic, where Robson was then acting in a burlesque on\r\nMacbeth, Mrs Keeley, if I remember rightly, taking the part of Lady\r\nMacbeth. In the scene before the murder, Macbeth had said he could not\r\nkill Duncan when he saw his boots upon the landing. Lady Macbeth put a\r\nstop to her husband\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation by whipping him up under her arm, and\r\ncarrying him off the stage, kicking and screaming. Ernest laughed till\r\nhe cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat rot Shakespeare is after this,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed,\r\ninvoluntarily. I remembered his essay on the Greek tragedians, and was\r\nmore I _\xc3\xa9pris_ with him than ever.\r\n\r\nNext day he set about looking for employment, and I did not see him\r\ntill about five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when he came and said that he had had no\r\nsuccess. The same thing happened the next day and the day after that.\r\nWherever he went he was invariably refused and often ordered point\r\nblank out of the shop; I could see by the expression of his face,\r\nthough he said nothing, that he was getting frightened, and began to\r\nthink I should have to come to the rescue. He said he had made a great\r\nmany enquiries and had always been told the same story. He found that\r\nit was easy to keep on in an old line, but very hard to strike out into\r\na new one.\r\n\r\nHe talked to the fishmonger in Leather Lane, where he went to buy a\r\nbloater for his tea, casually as though from curiosity and without any\r\ninterested motive. \xe2\x80\x9cSell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the master of the shop, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy nobody\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe what can be sold by penn\xe2\x80\x99orths and twopenn\xe2\x80\x99orths if\r\nyou go the right way to work. Look at whelks, for instance. Last\r\nSaturday night me and my little Emma here, we sold \xc2\xa37 worth of whelks\r\nbetween eight and half past eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x94and almost all in penn\xe2\x80\x99orths\r\nand twopenn\xe2\x80\x99orths\xe2\x80\x94a few, hap\xe2\x80\x99orths, but not many. It was the steam that\r\ndid it. We kept a-boiling of \xe2\x80\x99em hot and hot, and whenever the steam\r\ncame strong up from the cellar on to the pavement, the people bought,\r\nbut whenever the steam went down they left off buying; so we boiled\r\nthem over and over again till they was all sold. That\xe2\x80\x99s just where it\r\nis; if you know your business you can sell, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t you\xe2\x80\x99ll soon\r\nmake a mess of it. Why, but for the steam, I should not have sold 10s.\r\nworth of whelks all the night through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis, and many another yarn of kindred substance which he heard from\r\nother people determined Ernest more than ever to stake on tailoring as\r\nthe one trade about which he knew anything at all, nevertheless, here\r\nwere three or four days gone by and employment seemed as far off as\r\never.\r\n\r\nI now did what I ought to have done before, that is to say, I called on\r\nmy own tailor whom I had dealt with for over a quarter of a century and\r\nasked his advice. He declared Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s plan to be hopeless. \xe2\x80\x9cIf,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr Larkins, for this was my tailor\xe2\x80\x99s name, \xe2\x80\x9che had begun at fourteen,\r\nit might have done, but no man of twenty-four could stand being turned\r\nto work into a workshop full of tailors; he would not get on with the\r\nmen, nor the men with him; you could not expect him to be \xe2\x80\x98hail fellow,\r\nwell met\xe2\x80\x99 with them, and you could not expect his fellow-workmen to\r\nlike him if he was not. A man must have sunk low through drink or\r\nnatural taste for low company, before he could get on with those who\r\nhave had such a different training from his own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Larkins said a great deal more and wound up by taking me to see the\r\nplace where his own men worked. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a paradise,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccompared to most workshops. What gentleman could stand this air, think\r\nyou, for a fortnight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was glad enough to get out of the hot, fetid atmosphere in five\r\nminutes, and saw that there was no brick of Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s prison to be\r\nloosened by going and working among tailors in a workshop.\r\n\r\nMr Larkins wound up by saying that even if my _prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9_ were a much\r\nbetter workman than he probably was, no master would give him\r\nemployment, for fear of creating a bother among the men.\r\n\r\nI left, feeling that I ought to have thought of all this myself, and\r\nwas more than ever perplexed as to whether I had not better let my\r\nyoung friend have a few thousand pounds and send him out to the\r\ncolonies, when, on my return home at about five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, I found him\r\nwaiting for me, radiant, and declaring that he had found all he wanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems he had been patrolling the streets for the last three or four\r\nnights\xe2\x80\x94I suppose in search of something to do\xe2\x80\x94at any rate knowing\r\nbetter what he wanted to get than how to get it. Nevertheless, what he\r\nwanted was in reality so easily to be found that it took a highly\r\neducated scholar like himself to be unable to find it. But, however\r\nthis may be, he had been scared, and now saw lions where there were\r\nnone, and was shocked and frightened, and night after night his courage\r\nhad failed him and he had returned to his lodgings in Laystall Street\r\nwithout accomplishing his errand. He had not taken me into his\r\nconfidence upon this matter, and I had not enquired what he did with\r\nhimself in the evenings. At last he had concluded that, however painful\r\nit might be to him, he would call on Mrs Jupp, who he thought would be\r\nable to help him if anyone could. He had been walking moodily from\r\nseven till about nine, and now resolved to go straight to Ashpit Place\r\nand make a mother confessor of Mrs Jupp without more delay.\r\n\r\nOf all tasks that could be performed by mortal woman there was none\r\nwhich Mrs Jupp would have liked better than the one Ernest was thinking\r\nof imposing upon her; nor do I know that in his scared and broken-down\r\nstate he could have done much better than he now proposed. Miss Jupp\r\nwould have made it very easy for him to open his grief to her; indeed,\r\nshe would have coaxed it all out of him before he knew where he was;\r\nbut the fates were against Mrs Jupp, and the meeting between my hero\r\nand his former landlady was postponed _sine die_, for his determination\r\nhad hardly been formed and he had not gone more than a hundred yards in\r\nthe direction of Mrs Jupp\xe2\x80\x99s house, when a woman accosted him.\r\n\r\nHe was turning from her, as he had turned from so many others, when she\r\nstarted back with a movement that aroused his curiosity. He had hardly\r\nseen her face, but being determined to catch sight of it, followed her\r\nas she hurried away, and passed her; then turning round he saw that she\r\nwas none other than Ellen, the housemaid who had been dismissed by his\r\nmother eight years previously.\r\n\r\nHe ought to have assigned Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s unwillingness to see him to its true\r\ncause, but a guilty conscience made him think she had heard of his\r\ndisgrace and was turning away from him in contempt. Brave as had been\r\nhis resolutions about facing the world, this was more than he was\r\nprepared for; \xe2\x80\x9cWhat! you too shun me, Ellen?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe girl was crying bitterly and did not understand him. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Master\r\nErnest,\xe2\x80\x9d she sobbed, \xe2\x80\x9clet me go; you are too good for the likes of me\r\nto speak to now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Ellen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat nonsense you talk; you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been in\r\nprison, have you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, no, no, not so bad as that,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed passionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ernest, with a forced laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cI came out three or\r\nfour days ago after six months with hard labour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEllen did not believe him, but she looked at him with a \xe2\x80\x9cLor\xe2\x80\x99! Master\r\nErnest,\xe2\x80\x9d and dried her eyes at once. The ice was broken between them,\r\nfor as a matter of fact Ellen had been in prison several times, and\r\nthough she did not believe Ernest, his merely saying he had been in\r\nprison made her feel more at ease with him. For her there were two\r\nclasses of people, those who had been in prison and those who had not.\r\nThe first she looked upon as fellow-creatures and more or less\r\nChristians, the second, with few exceptions, she regarded with\r\nsuspicion, not wholly unmingled with contempt.\r\n\r\nThen Ernest told her what had happened to him during the last six\r\nmonths, and by-and-by she believed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster Ernest,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, after they had talked for a quarter of an\r\nhour or so, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a place over the way where they sell tripe and\r\nonions. I know you was always very fond of tripe and onions, let\xe2\x80\x99s go\r\nover and have some, and we can talk better there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the pair crossed the street and entered the tripe shop; Ernest\r\nordered supper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how is your pore dear mamma, and your dear papa, Master Ernest,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Ellen, who had now recovered herself and was quite at home with my\r\nhero. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear, dear me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI did love your pa; he was a good\r\ngentleman, he was, and your ma too; it would do anyone good to live\r\nwith her, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest was surprised and hardly knew what to say. He had expected to\r\nfind Ellen indignant at the way she had been treated, and inclined to\r\nlay the blame of her having fallen to her present state at his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nand mother\xe2\x80\x99s door. It was not so. Her only recollection of Battersby\r\nwas as of a place where she had had plenty to eat and drink, not too\r\nmuch hard work, and where she had not been scolded. When she heard that\r\nErnest had quarrelled with his father and mother she assumed as a\r\nmatter of course that the fault must lie entirely with Ernest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, your pore, pore ma!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ellen. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was always so very fond of\r\nyou, Master Ernest: you was always her favourite; I can\xe2\x80\x99t abear to\r\nthink of anything between you and her. To think now of the way she used\r\nto have me into the dining-room and teach me my catechism, that she\r\ndid! Oh, Master Ernest, you really must go and make it all up with her;\r\nindeed you must.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest felt rueful, but he had resisted so valiantly already that the\r\ndevil might have saved himself the trouble of trying to get at him\r\nthrough Ellen in the matter of his father and mother. He changed the\r\nsubject, and the pair warmed to one another as they had their tripe and\r\npots of beer. Of all people in the world Ellen was perhaps the one to\r\nwhom Ernest could have spoken most freely at this juncture. He told her\r\nwhat he thought he could have told to no one else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Ellen,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cI had learnt as a boy things that I\r\nought not to have learnt, and had never had a chance of that which\r\nwould have set me straight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlefolks is always like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ellen musingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you are right, but I am no longer a gentleman, Ellen, and I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see why I should be \xe2\x80\x98like that\xe2\x80\x99 any longer, my dear. I want you\r\nto help me to be like something else as soon as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor\xe2\x80\x99! Master Ernest, whatever can you be meaning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe pair soon afterwards left the eating-house and walked up Fetter\r\nLane together.\r\n\r\nEllen had had hard times since she had left Battersby, but they had\r\nleft little trace upon her.\r\n\r\nErnest saw only the fresh-looking smiling face, the dimpled cheek, the\r\nclear blue eyes and lovely sphinx-like lips which he had remembered as\r\na boy. At nineteen she had looked older than she was, now she looked\r\nmuch younger; indeed she looked hardly older than when Ernest had last\r\nseen her, and it would have taken a man of much greater experience than\r\nhe possessed to suspect how completely she had fallen from her first\r\nestate. It never occurred to him that the poor condition of her\r\nwardrobe was due to her passion for ardent spirits, and that first and\r\nlast she had served five or six times as much time in gaol as he had.\r\nHe ascribed the poverty of her attire to the attempts to keep herself\r\nrespectable, which Ellen during supper had more than once alluded to.\r\nHe had been charmed with the way in which she had declared that a pint\r\nof beer would make her tipsy, and had only allowed herself to be forced\r\ninto drinking the whole after a good deal of remonstrance. To him she\r\nappeared a very angel dropped from the sky, and all the more easy to\r\nget on with for being a fallen one.\r\n\r\nAs he walked up Fetter Lane with her towards Laystall Street, he\r\nthought of the wonderful goodness of God towards him in throwing in his\r\nway the very person of all others whom he was most glad to see, and\r\nwhom, of all others, in spite of her living so near him, he might have\r\nnever fallen in with but for a happy accident.\r\n\r\nWhen people get it into their heads that they are being specially\r\nfavoured by the Almighty, they had better as a general rule mind their\r\np\xe2\x80\x99s and q\xe2\x80\x99s, and when they think they see the devil\xe2\x80\x99s drift with more\r\nspecial clearness, let them remember that he has had much more\r\nexperience than they have, and is probably meditating mischief.\r\n\r\nAlready during supper the thought that in Ellen at last he had found a\r\nwoman whom he could love well enough to wish to live with and marry had\r\nflitted across his mind, and the more they had chatted the more reasons\r\nkept suggesting themselves for thinking that what might be folly in\r\nordinary cases would not be folly in his.\r\n\r\nHe must marry someone; that was already settled. He could not marry a\r\nlady; that was absurd. He must marry a poor woman. Yes, but a fallen\r\none? Was he not fallen himself? Ellen would fall no more. He had only\r\nto look at her to be sure of this. He could not live with her in sin,\r\nnot for more than the shortest time that could elapse before their\r\nmarriage; he no longer believed in the supernatural element of\r\nChristianity, but the Christian morality at any rate was indisputable.\r\nBesides, they might have children, and a stigma would rest upon them.\r\nWhom had he to consult but himself now? His father and mother never\r\nneed know, and even if they did, they should be thankful to see him\r\nmarried to any woman who would make him happy as Ellen would. As for\r\nnot being able to afford marriage, how did poor people do? Did not a\r\ngood wife rather help matters than not? Where one could live two could\r\ndo so, and if Ellen was three or four years older than he was\xe2\x80\x94well,\r\nwhat was that?\r\n\r\nHave you, gentle reader, ever loved at first sight? When you fell in\r\nlove at first sight, how long, let me ask, did it take you to become\r\nready to fling every other consideration to the winds except that of\r\nobtaining possession of the loved one? Or rather, how long would it\r\nhave taken you if you had had no father or mother, nothing to lose in\r\nthe way of money, position, friends, professional advancement, or what\r\nnot, and if the object of your affections was as free from all these\r\n_impedimenta_ as you were yourself?\r\n\r\nIf you were a young John Stuart Mill, perhaps it would have taken you\r\nsome time, but suppose your nature was Quixotic, impulsive, altruistic,\r\nguileless; suppose you were a hungry man starving for something to love\r\nand lean upon, for one whose burdens you might bear, and who might help\r\nyou to bear yours. Suppose you were down on your luck, still stunned by\r\na horrible shock, and this bright vista of a happy future floated\r\nsuddenly before you, how long under these circumstances do you think\r\nyou would reflect before you would decide on embracing what chance had\r\nthrown in your way?\r\n\r\nIt did not take my hero long, for before he got past the ham and beef\r\nshop near the top of Fetter Lane, he had told Ellen that she must come\r\nhome with him and live with him till they could get married, which they\r\nwould do upon the first day that the law allowed.\r\n\r\nI think the devil must have chuckled and made tolerably sure of his\r\ngame this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nErnest told Ellen of his difficulty about finding employment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what do you think of going into a shop for, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ellen.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not take a little shop yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest asked how much this would cost. Ellen told him that he might\r\ntake a house in some small street, say near the \xe2\x80\x9cElephant and Castle,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nfor 17s. or 18s. a week, and let off the two top floors for 10s.,\r\nkeeping the back parlour and shop for themselves. If he could raise\r\nfive or six pounds to buy some second-hand clothes to stock the shop\r\nwith, they could mend them and clean them, and she could look after the\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x99s clothes while he did the men\xe2\x80\x99s. Then he could mend and make, if\r\nhe could get the orders.\r\n\r\nThey could soon make a business of \xc2\xa32 a week in this way; she had a\r\nfriend who began like that and had now moved to a better shop, where\r\nshe made \xc2\xa35 or \xc2\xa36 a week at least\xe2\x80\x94and she, Ellen, had done the greater\r\npart of the buying and selling herself.\r\n\r\nHere was a new light indeed. It was as though he had got his \xc2\xa35000 back\r\nagain all of a sudden, and perhaps ever so much more later on into the\r\nbargain. Ellen seemed more than ever to be his good genius.\r\n\r\nShe went out and got a few rashers of bacon for his and her breakfast.\r\nShe cooked them much more nicely than he had been able to do, and laid\r\nbreakfast for him and made coffee, and some nice brown toast. Ernest\r\nhad been his own cook and housemaid for the last few days and had not\r\ngiven himself satisfaction. Here he suddenly found himself with someone\r\nto wait on him again. Not only had Ellen pointed out to him how he\r\ncould earn a living when no one except himself had known how to advise\r\nhim, but here she was so pretty and smiling, looking after even his\r\ncomforts, and restoring him practically in all respects that he much\r\ncared about to the position which he had lost\xe2\x80\x94or rather putting him in\r\none that he already liked much better. No wonder he was radiant when he\r\ncame to explain his plans to me.\r\n\r\nHe had some difficulty in telling all that had happened. He hesitated,\r\nblushed, hummed and hawed. Misgivings began to cross his mind when he\r\nfound himself obliged to tell his story to someone else. He felt\r\ninclined to slur things over, but I wanted to get at the facts, so I\r\nhelped him over the bad places, and questioned him till I had got out\r\npretty nearly the whole story as I have given it above.\r\n\r\nI hope I did not show it, but I was very angry. I had begun to like\r\nErnest. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why, but I never have heard that any young man to\r\nwhom I had become attached was going to get married without hating his\r\nintended instinctively, though I had never seen her; I have observed\r\nthat most bachelors feel the same thing, though we are generally at\r\nsome pains to hide the fact. Perhaps it is because we know we ought to\r\nhave got married ourselves. Ordinarily we say we are delighted\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\npresent case I did not feel obliged to do this, though I made an effort\r\nto conceal my vexation. That a young man of much promise who was heir\r\nalso to what was now a handsome fortune, should fling himself away upon\r\nsuch a person as Ellen was quite too provoking, and the more so because\r\nof the unexpectedness of the whole affair.\r\n\r\nI begged him not to marry Ellen yet\xe2\x80\x94not at least until he had known her\r\nfor a longer time. He would not hear of it; he had given his word, and\r\nif he had not given it he should go and give it at once. I had hitherto\r\nfound him upon most matters singularly docile and easy to manage, but\r\non this point I could do nothing with him. His recent victory over his\r\nfather and mother had increased his strength, and I was nowhere. I\r\nwould have told him of his true position, but I knew very well that\r\nthis would only make him more bent on having his own way\xe2\x80\x94for with so\r\nmuch money why should he not please himself? I said nothing, therefore,\r\non this head, and yet all that I could urge went for very little with\r\none who believed himself to be an artisan or nothing.\r\n\r\nReally from his own standpoint there was nothing very outrageous in\r\nwhat he was doing. He had known and been very fond of Ellen years\r\nbefore. He knew her to come of respectable people, and to have borne a\r\ngood character, and to have been universally liked at Battersby. She\r\nwas then a quick, smart, hard-working girl\xe2\x80\x94and a very pretty one. When\r\nat last they met again she was on her best behaviour, in fact, she was\r\nmodesty and demureness itself. What wonder, then, that his imagination\r\nshould fail to realise the changes that eight years must have worked?\r\nHe knew too much against himself, and was too bankrupt in love to be\r\nsqueamish; if Ellen had been only what he thought her, and if his\r\nprospects had been in reality no better than he believed they were, I\r\ndo not know that there is anything much more imprudent in what Ernest\r\nproposed than there is in half the marriages that take place every day.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for it, however, but to make the best of the\r\ninevitable, so I wished my young friend good fortune, and told him he\r\ncould have whatever money he wanted to start his shop with, if what he\r\nhad in hand was not sufficient. He thanked me, asked me to be kind\r\nenough to let him do all my mending and repairing, and to get him any\r\nother like orders that I could, and left me to my own reflections.\r\n\r\nI was even more angry when he was gone than I had been while he was\r\nwith me. His frank, boyish face had beamed with a happiness that had\r\nrarely visited it. Except at Cambridge he had hardly known what\r\nhappiness meant, and even there his life had been clouded as of a man\r\nfor whom wisdom at the greatest of its entrances was quite shut out. I\r\nhad seen enough of the world and of him to have observed this, but it\r\nwas impossible, or I thought it had been impossible, for me to have\r\nhelped him.\r\n\r\nWhether I ought to have tried to help him or not I do not know, but I\r\nam sure that the young of all animals often do want help upon matters\r\nabout which anyone would say _a priori_ that there should be no\r\ndifficulty. One would think that a young seal would want no teaching\r\nhow to swim, nor yet a bird to fly, but in practice a young seal drowns\r\nif put out of its depth before its parents have taught it to swim; and\r\nso again, even the young hawk must be taught to fly before it can do\r\nso.\r\n\r\nI grant that the tendency of the times is to exaggerate the good which\r\nteaching can do, but in trying to teach too much, in most matters, we\r\nhave neglected others in respect of which a little sensible teaching\r\nwould do no harm.\r\n\r\nI know it is the fashion to say that young people must find out things\r\nfor themselves, and so they probably would if they had fair play to the\r\nextent of not having obstacles put in their way. But they seldom have\r\nfair play; as a general rule they meet with foul play, and foul play\r\nfrom those who live by selling them stones made into a great variety of\r\nshapes and sizes so as to form a tolerable imitation of bread.\r\n\r\nSome are lucky enough to meet with few obstacles, some are plucky\r\nenough to over-ride them, but in the greater number of cases, if people\r\nare saved at all they are saved so as by fire.\r\n\r\nWhile Ernest was with me Ellen was looking out for a shop on the south\r\nside of the Thames near the \xe2\x80\x9cElephant and Castle,\xe2\x80\x9d which was then\r\nalmost a new and a very rising neighbourhood. By one o\xe2\x80\x99clock she had\r\nfound several from which a selection was to be made, and before night\r\nthe pair had made their choice.\r\n\r\nErnest brought Ellen to me. I did not want to see her, but could not\r\nwell refuse. He had laid out a few of his shillings upon her wardrobe,\r\nso that she was neatly dressed, and, indeed, she looked very pretty and\r\nso good that I could hardly be surprised at Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s infatuation when\r\nthe other circumstances of the case were taken into consideration. Of\r\ncourse we hated one another instinctively from the first moment we set\r\neyes on one another, but we each told Ernest that we had been most\r\nfavourably impressed.\r\n\r\nThen I was taken to see the shop. An empty house is like a stray dog or\r\na body from which life has departed. Decay sets in at once in every\r\npart of it, and what mould and wind and weather would spare, street\r\nboys commonly destroy. Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s shop in its untenanted state was a\r\ndirty unsavoury place enough. The house was not old, but it had been\r\nrun up by a jerry-builder and its constitution had no stamina whatever.\r\nIt was only by being kept warm and quiet that it would remain in health\r\nfor many months together. Now it had been empty for some weeks and the\r\ncats had got in by night, while the boys had broken the windows by day.\r\nThe parlour floor was covered with stones and dirt, and in the area was\r\na dead dog which had been killed in the street and been thrown down\r\ninto the first unprotected place that could be found. There was a\r\nstrong smell throughout the house, but whether it was bugs, or rats, or\r\ncats, or drains, or a compound of all four, I could not determine. The\r\nsashes did not fit, the flimsy doors hung badly; the skirting was gone\r\nin several places, and there were not a few holes in the floor; the\r\nlocks were loose, and paper was torn and dirty; the stairs were weak\r\nand one felt the treads give as one went up them.\r\n\r\nOver and above these drawbacks the house had an ill name, by reason of\r\nthe fact that the wife of the last occupant had hanged herself in it\r\nnot very many weeks previously. She had set down a bloater before the\r\nfire for her husband\xe2\x80\x99s tea, and had made him a round of toast. She then\r\nleft the room as though about to return to it shortly, but instead of\r\ndoing so she went into the back kitchen and hanged herself without a\r\nword. It was this which had kept the house empty so long in spite of\r\nits excellent position as a corner shop. The last tenant had left\r\nimmediately after the inquest, and if the owner had had it done up then\r\npeople would have got over the tragedy that had been enacted in it, but\r\nthe combination of bad condition and bad fame had hindered many from\r\ntaking it, who like Ellen, could see that it had great business\r\ncapabilities. Almost anything would have sold there, but it happened\r\nalso that there was no second-hand clothes shop in close proximity so\r\nthat everything combined in its favour, except its filthy state and its\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw it, I thought I would rather die than live in such an awful\r\nplace\xe2\x80\x94but then I had been living in the Temple for the last five and\r\ntwenty years. Ernest was lodging in Laystall Street and had just come\r\nout of prison; before this he had lived in Ashpit Place so that this\r\nhouse had no terrors for him provided he could get it done up. The\r\ndifficulty was that the landlord was hard to move in this respect. It\r\nended in my finding the money to do everything that was wanted, and\r\ntaking a lease of the house for five years at the same rental as that\r\npaid by the last occupant. I then sublet it to Ernest, of course taking\r\ncare that it was put more efficiently into repair than his landlord was\r\nat all likely to have put it.\r\n\r\nA week later I called and found everything so completely transformed\r\nthat I should hardly have recognised the house. All the ceilings had\r\nbeen whitewashed, all the rooms papered, the broken glass hacked out\r\nand reinstated, the defective wood-work renewed, all the sashes,\r\ncupboards and doors had been painted. The drains had been thoroughly\r\noverhauled, everything in fact, that could be done had been done, and\r\nthe rooms now looked as cheerful as they had been forbidding when I had\r\nlast seen them. The people who had done the repairs were supposed to\r\nhave cleaned the house down before leaving, but Ellen had given it\r\nanother scrub from top to bottom herself after they were gone, and it\r\nwas as clean as a new pin. I almost felt as though I could have lived\r\nin it myself, and as for Ernest, he was in the seventh heaven. He said\r\nit was all my doing and Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nThere was already a counter in the shop and a few fittings, so that\r\nnothing now remained but to get some stock and set them out for sale.\r\nErnest said he could not begin better than by selling his clerical\r\nwardrobe and his books, for though the shop was intended especially for\r\nthe sale of second-hand clothes, yet Ellen said there was no reason why\r\nthey should not sell a few books too; so a beginning was to be made by\r\nselling the books he had had at school and college at about one\r\nshilling a volume, taking them all round, and I have heard him say that\r\nhe learned more that proved of practical use to him through stocking\r\nhis books on a bench in front of his shop and selling them, than he had\r\ndone from all the years of study which he had bestowed upon their\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\nFor the enquiries that were made of him whether he had such and such a\r\nbook taught him what he could sell and what he could not; how much he\r\ncould get for this, and how much for that. Having made ever such a\r\nlittle beginning with books, he took to attending book sales as well as\r\nclothes sales, and ere long this branch of his business became no less\r\nimportant than the tailoring, and would, I have no doubt, have been the\r\none which he would have settled down to exclusively, if he had been\r\ncalled upon to remain a tradesman; but this is anticipating.\r\n\r\nI made a contribution and a stipulation. Ernest wanted to sink the\r\ngentleman completely, until such time as he could work his way up\r\nagain. If he had been left to himself he would have lived with Ellen in\r\nthe shop back parlour and kitchen, and have let out both the upper\r\nfloors according to his original programme. I did not want him,\r\nhowever, to cut himself adrift from music, letters and polite life, and\r\nfeared that unless he had some kind of den into which he could retire\r\nhe would ere long become the tradesman and nothing else. I therefore\r\ninsisted on taking the first floor front and back myself, and\r\nfurnishing them with the things which had been left at Mrs Jupp\xe2\x80\x99s. I\r\nbought these things of him for a small sum and had them moved into his\r\npresent abode.\r\n\r\nI went to Mrs Jupp\xe2\x80\x99s to arrange all this, as Ernest did not like going\r\nto Ashpit Place. I had half expected to find the furniture sold and Mrs\r\nJupp gone, but it was not so; with all her faults the poor old woman\r\nwas perfectly honest.\r\n\r\nI told her that Pryer had taken all Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s money and run away with\r\nit. She hated Pryer. \xe2\x80\x9cI never knew anyone,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cas\r\nwhite-livered in the face as that Pryer; he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got an upright vein\r\nin his whole body. Why, all that time when he used to come breakfasting\r\nwith Mr Pontifex morning after morning, it took me to a perfect shadow\r\nthe way he carried on. There was no doing anything to please him right.\r\nFirst I used to get them eggs and bacon, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t like that; and\r\nthen I got him a bit of fish, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t like that, or else it was\r\ntoo dear, and you know fish is dearer than ever; and then I got him a\r\nbit of German, and he said it rose on him; then I tried sausages, and\r\nhe said they hit him in the eye worse even than German; oh! how I used\r\nto wander my room and fret about it inwardly and cry for hours, and all\r\nabout them paltry breakfasts\xe2\x80\x94and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Mr Pontifex; he\xe2\x80\x99d like\r\nanything that anyone chose to give him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so the piano\xe2\x80\x99s to go,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat beautiful tunes Mr\r\nPontifex did play upon it, to be sure; and there was one I liked better\r\nthan any I ever heard. I was in the room when he played it once and\r\nwhen I said, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, Mr Pontifex, that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of woman I am,\xe2\x80\x99 he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Mrs Jupp, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t, for this tune is old, but no one can say you\r\nare old.\xe2\x80\x99 But, bless you, he meant nothing by it, it was only his mucky\r\nflattery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLike myself, she was vexed at his getting married. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t like his\r\nbeing married, and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like his not being married\xe2\x80\x94but, anyhow,\r\nit was Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s fault, not his, and she hoped he would be happy. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nafter all,\xe2\x80\x9d she concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cit ain\xe2\x80\x99t you and it ain\xe2\x80\x99t me, and it ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhim and it ain\xe2\x80\x99t her. It\xe2\x80\x99s what you must call the fortunes of\r\nmatterimony, for there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no other word for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the course of the afternoon the furniture arrived at Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s new\r\nabode. In the first floor we placed the piano, table, pictures,\r\nbookshelves, a couple of arm-chairs, and all the little household gods\r\nwhich he had brought from Cambridge. The back room was furnished\r\nexactly as his bedroom at Ashpit Place had been\xe2\x80\x94new things being got\r\nfor the bridal apartment downstairs. These two first-floor rooms I\r\ninsisted on retaining as my own, but Ernest was to use them whenever he\r\npleased; he was never to sublet even the bedroom, but was to keep it\r\nfor himself in case his wife should be ill at any time, or in case he\r\nmight be ill himself.\r\n\r\nIn less than a fortnight from the time of his leaving prison all these\r\narrangements had been completed, and Ernest felt that he had again\r\nlinked himself on to the life which he had led before his\r\nimprisonment\xe2\x80\x94with a few important differences, however, which were\r\ngreatly to his advantage. He was no longer a clergyman; he was about to\r\nmarry a woman to whom he was much attached, and he had parted company\r\nfor ever with his father and mother.\r\n\r\nTrue, he had lost all his money, his reputation, and his position as a\r\ngentleman; he had, in fact, had to burn his house down in order to get\r\nhis roast sucking pig; but if asked whether he would rather be as he\r\nwas now or as he was on the day before his arrest, he would not have\r\nhad a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation in preferring his present to his past. If his\r\npresent could only have been purchased at the expense of all that he\r\nhad gone through, it was still worth purchasing at the price, and he\r\nwould go through it all again if necessary. The loss of the money was\r\nthe worst, but Ellen said she was sure they would get on, and she knew\r\nall about it. As for the loss of reputation\xe2\x80\x94considering that he had\r\nEllen and me left, it did not come to much.\r\n\r\nI saw the house on the afternoon of the day on which all was finished,\r\nand there remained nothing but to buy some stock and begin selling.\r\nWhen I was gone, after he had had his tea, he stole up to his\r\ncastle\xe2\x80\x94the first floor front. He lit his pipe and sat down to the\r\npiano. He played Handel for an hour or so, and then set himself to the\r\ntable to read and write. He took all his sermons and all the\r\ntheological works he had begun to compose during the time he had been a\r\nclergyman and put them in the fire; as he saw them consume he felt as\r\nthough he had got rid of another incubus. Then he took up some of the\r\nlittle pieces he had begun to write during the latter part of his\r\nundergraduate life at Cambridge, and began to cut them about and\r\nre-write them. As he worked quietly at these till he heard the clock\r\nstrike ten and it was time to go to bed, he felt that he was now not\r\nonly happy but supremely happy.\r\n\r\nNext day Ellen took him to Debenham\xe2\x80\x99s auction rooms, and they surveyed\r\nthe lots of clothes which were hung up all round the auction room to be\r\nviewed. Ellen had had sufficient experience to know about how much each\r\nlot ought to fetch; she overhauled lot after lot, and valued it; in a\r\nvery short time Ernest himself began to have a pretty fair idea what\r\neach lot should go for, and before the morning was over valued a dozen\r\nlots running at prices about which Ellen said he would not hurt if he\r\ncould get them for that.\r\n\r\nSo far from disliking this work or finding it tedious, he liked it very\r\nmuch, indeed he would have liked anything which did not overtax his\r\nphysical strength, and which held out a prospect of bringing him in\r\nmoney. Ellen would not let him buy anything on the occasion of this\r\nsale; she said he had better see one sale first and watch how prices\r\nactually went. So at twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock when the sale began, he saw the\r\nlots sold which he and Ellen had marked, and by the time the sale was\r\nover he knew enough to be able to bid with safety whenever he should\r\nactually want to buy. Knowledge of this sort is very easily acquired by\r\nanyone who is in _bona fide_ want of it.\r\n\r\nBut Ellen did not want him to buy at auctions\xe2\x80\x94not much at least at\r\npresent. Private dealing, she said, was best. If I, for example, had\r\nany cast-off clothes, he was to buy them from my laundress, and get a\r\nconnection with other laundresses, to whom he might give a trifle more\r\nthan they got at present for whatever clothes their masters might give\r\nthem, and yet make a good profit. If gentlemen sold their things, he\r\nwas to try and get them to sell to him. He flinched at nothing; perhaps\r\nhe would have flinched if he had had any idea how _outr\xc3\xa9_ his\r\nproceedings were, but the very ignorance of the world which had ruined\r\nhim up till now, by a happy irony began to work its own cure. If some\r\nmalignant fairy had meant to curse him in this respect, she had\r\noverdone her malice. He did not know he was doing anything strange. He\r\nonly knew that he had no money, and must provide for himself, a wife,\r\nand a possible family. More than this, he wanted to have some leisure\r\nin an evening, so that he might read and write and keep up his music.\r\nIf anyone would show him how he could do better than he was doing, he\r\nshould be much obliged to them, but to himself it seemed that he was\r\ndoing sufficiently well; for at the end of the first week the pair\r\nfound they had made a clear profit of \xc2\xa33. In a few weeks this had\r\nincreased to \xc2\xa34, and by the New Year they had made a profit of \xc2\xa35 in\r\none week.\r\n\r\nErnest had by this time been married some two months, for he had stuck\r\nto his original plan of marrying Ellen on the first day he could\r\nlegally do so. This date was a little delayed by the change of abode\r\nfrom Laystall Street to Blackfriars, but on the first day that it could\r\nbe done it was done. He had never had more than \xc2\xa3250 a year, even in\r\nthe times of his affluence, so that a profit of \xc2\xa35 a week, if it could\r\nbe maintained steadily, would place him where he had been as far as\r\nincome went, and, though he should have to feed two mouths instead of\r\none, yet his expenses in other ways were so much curtailed by his\r\nchanged social position, that, take it all round, his income was\r\npractically what it had been a twelvemonth before. The next thing to do\r\nwas to increase it, and put by money.\r\n\r\nProsperity depends, as we all know, in great measure upon energy and\r\ngood sense, but it also depends not a little upon pure luck\xe2\x80\x94that is to\r\nsay, upon connections which are in such a tangle that it is more easy\r\nto say that they do not exist, than to try to trace them. A\r\nneighbourhood may have an excellent reputation as being likely to be a\r\nrising one, and yet may become suddenly eclipsed by another, which no\r\none would have thought so promising. A fever hospital may divert the\r\nstream of business, or a new station attract it; so little, indeed, can\r\nbe certainly known, that it is better not to try to know more than is\r\nin everybody\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, and to leave the rest to chance.\r\n\r\nLuck, which certainly had not been too kind to my hero hitherto, now\r\nseemed to have taken him under her protection. The neighbourhood\r\nprospered, and he with it. It seemed as though he no sooner bought a\r\nthing and put it into his shop, than it sold with a profit of from\r\nthirty to fifty per cent. He learned book-keeping, and watched his\r\naccounts carefully, following up any success immediately; he began to\r\nbuy other things besides clothes\xe2\x80\x94such as books, music, odds and ends of\r\nfurniture, etc. Whether it was luck or business aptitude, or energy, or\r\nthe politeness with which he treated all his customers, I cannot\r\nsay\xe2\x80\x94but to the surprise of no one more than himself, he went ahead\r\nfaster than he had anticipated, even in his wildest dreams, and by\r\nEaster was established in a strong position as the owner of a business\r\nwhich was bringing him in between four and five hundred a year, and\r\nwhich he understood how to extend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nEllen and he got on capitally, all the better, perhaps, because the\r\ndisparity between them was so great, that neither did Ellen want to be\r\nelevated, nor did Ernest want to elevate her. He was very fond of her,\r\nand very kind to her; they had interests which they could serve in\r\ncommon; they had antecedents with a good part of which each was\r\nfamiliar; they had each of them excellent tempers, and this was enough.\r\nEllen did not seem jealous at Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s preferring to sit the greater\r\npart of his time after the day\xe2\x80\x99s work was done in the first floor front\r\nwhere I occasionally visited him. She might have come and sat with him\r\nif she had liked, but, somehow or other, she generally found enough to\r\noccupy her down below. She had the tact also to encourage him to go out\r\nof an evening whenever he had a mind, without in the least caring that\r\nhe should take her too\xe2\x80\x94and this suited Ernest very well. He was, I\r\nshould say, much happier in his married life than people generally are.\r\n\r\nAt first it had been very painful to him to meet any of his old\r\nfriends, as he sometimes accidentally did, but this soon passed; either\r\nthey cut him, or he cut them; it was not nice being cut for the first\r\ntime or two, but after that, it became rather pleasant than not, and\r\nwhen he began to see that he was going ahead, he cared very little what\r\npeople might say about his antecedents. The ordeal is a painful one,\r\nbut if a man\xe2\x80\x99s moral and intellectual constitution are naturally sound,\r\nthere is nothing which will give him so much strength of character as\r\nhaving been well cut.\r\n\r\nIt was easy for him to keep his expenditure down, for his tastes were\r\nnot luxurious. He liked theatres, outings into the country on a Sunday,\r\nand tobacco, but he did not care for much else, except writing and\r\nmusic. As for the usual run of concerts, he hated them. He worshipped\r\nHandel; he liked Offenbach, and the airs that went about the streets,\r\nbut he cared for nothing between these two extremes. Music, therefore,\r\ncost him little. As for theatres, I got him and Ellen as many orders as\r\nthey liked, so these cost them nothing. The Sunday outings were a small\r\nitem; for a shilling or two he could get a return ticket to some place\r\nfar enough out of town to give him a good walk and a thorough change\r\nfor the day. Ellen went with him the first few times, but she said she\r\nfound it too much for her, there were a few of her old friends whom she\r\nshould sometimes like to see, and they and he, she said, would not hit\r\nit off perhaps too well, so it would be better for him to go alone.\r\nThis seemed so sensible, and suited Ernest so exactly that he readily\r\nfell into it, nor did he suspect dangers which were apparent enough to\r\nme when I heard how she had treated the matter. I kept silence,\r\nhowever, and for a time all continued to go well. As I have said, one\r\nof his chief pleasures was in writing. If a man carries with him a\r\nlittle sketch book and is continually jotting down sketches, he has the\r\nartistic instinct; a hundred things may hinder his due development, but\r\nthe instinct is there. The literary instinct may be known by a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nkeeping a small note-book in his waistcoat pocket, into which he jots\r\ndown anything that strikes him, or any good thing that he hears said,\r\nor a reference to any passage which he thinks will come in useful to\r\nhim. Ernest had such a note-book always with him. Even when he was at\r\nCambridge he had begun the practice without anyone\xe2\x80\x99s having suggested\r\nit to him. These notes he copied out from time to time into a book,\r\nwhich as they accumulated, he was driven into indexing approximately,\r\nas he went along. When I found out this, I knew that he had the\r\nliterary instinct, and when I saw his notes I began to hope great\r\nthings of him.\r\n\r\nFor a long time I was disappointed. He was kept back by the nature of\r\nthe subjects he chose\xe2\x80\x94which were generally metaphysical. In vain I\r\ntried to get him away from these to matters which had a greater\r\ninterest for the general public. When I begged him to try his hand at\r\nsome pretty, graceful, little story which should be full of whatever\r\npeople knew and liked best, he would immediately set to work upon a\r\ntreatise to show the grounds on which all belief rested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are stirring mud,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cor poking at a sleeping dog. You are\r\ntrying to make people resume consciousness about things, which, with\r\nsensible men, have already passed into the unconscious stage. The men\r\nwhom you would disturb are in front of you, and not, as you fancy,\r\nbehind you; it is you who are the lagger, not they.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could not see it. He said he was engaged on an essay upon the famous\r\n_quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus_ of St Vincent de Lerins.\r\nThis was the more provoking because he showed himself able to do better\r\nthings if he had liked.\r\n\r\nI was then at work upon my burlesque \xe2\x80\x9cThe Impatient Griselda,\xe2\x80\x9d and was\r\nsometimes at my wits\xe2\x80\x99 end for a piece of business or a situation; he\r\ngave me many suggestions, all of which were marked by excellent good\r\nsense. Nevertheless I could not prevail with him to put philosophy on\r\none side, and was obliged to leave him to himself.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, as I have said, his choice of subjects continued to be\r\nsuch as I could not approve. He was continually studying scientific and\r\nmetaphysical writers, in the hope of either finding or making for\r\nhimself a philosopher\xe2\x80\x99s stone in the shape of a system which should go\r\non all fours under all circumstances, instead of being liable to be\r\nupset at every touch and turn, as every system yet promulgated has\r\nturned out to be.\r\n\r\nHe kept to the pursuit of this will-o\xe2\x80\x99-the-wisp so long that I gave up\r\nhope, and set him down as another fly that had been caught, as it were,\r\nby a piece of paper daubed over with some sticky stuff that had not\r\neven the merit of being sweet, but to my surprise he at last declared\r\nthat he was satisfied, and had found what he wanted.\r\n\r\nI supposed that he had only hit upon some new \xe2\x80\x9cLo, here!\xe2\x80\x9d when to my\r\nrelief, he told me that he had concluded that no system which should go\r\nperfectly upon all fours was possible, inasmuch as no one could get\r\nbehind Bishop Berkeley, and therefore no absolutely incontrovertible\r\nfirst premise could ever be laid. Having found this he was just as well\r\npleased as if he had found the most perfect system imaginable. All he\r\nwanted he said, was to know which way it was to be\xe2\x80\x94that is to say\r\nwhether a system was possible or not, and if possible then what the\r\nsystem was to be. Having found out that no system based on absolute\r\ncertainty was possible he was contented.\r\n\r\nI had only a very vague idea who Bishop Berkeley was, but was thankful\r\nto him for having defended us from an incontrovertible first premise. I\r\nam afraid I said a few words implying that after a great deal of\r\ntrouble he had arrived at the conclusion which sensible people reach\r\nwithout bothering their brains so much.\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I was not born sensible. A child of ordinary powers\r\nlearns to walk at a year or two old without knowing much about it;\r\nfailing ordinary powers he had better learn laboriously than never\r\nlearn at all. I am sorry I was not stronger, but to do as I did was my\r\nonly chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked so meek that I was vexed with myself for having said what I\r\nhad, more especially when I remembered his bringing-up, which had\r\ndoubtless done much to impair his power of taking a common-sense view\r\nof things. He continued\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see it all now. The people like Towneley are the only ones who know\r\nanything that is worth knowing, and like that of course I can never be.\r\nBut to make Towneleys possible there must be hewers of wood and drawers\r\nof water\xe2\x80\x94men in fact through whom conscious knowledge must pass before\r\nit can reach those who can apply it gracefully and instinctively as the\r\nTowneleys can. I am a hewer of wood, but if I accept the position\r\nfrankly and do not set up to be a Towneley, it does not matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe still, therefore, stuck to science instead of turning to literature\r\nproper as I hoped he would have done, but he confined himself\r\nhenceforth to enquiries on specific subjects concerning which an\r\nincrease of our knowledge\xe2\x80\x94as he said\xe2\x80\x94was possible. Having in fact,\r\nafter infinite vexation of spirit, arrived at a conclusion which cut at\r\nthe roots of all knowledge, he settled contentedly down to the pursuit\r\nof knowledge, and has pursued it ever since in spite of occasional\r\nexcursions into the regions of literature proper.\r\n\r\nBut this is anticipating, and may perhaps also convey a wrong\r\nimpression, for from the outset he did occasionally turn his attention\r\nto work which must be more properly called literary than either\r\nscientific or metaphysical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout six months after he had set up his shop his prosperity had\r\nreached its climax. It seemed even then as though he were likely to go\r\nahead no less fast than heretofore, and I doubt not that he would have\r\ndone so, if success or non-success had depended upon himself alone.\r\nUnfortunately he was not the only person to be reckoned with.\r\n\r\nOne morning he had gone out to attend some sales, leaving his wife\r\nperfectly well, as usual in good spirits, and looking very pretty. When\r\nhe came back he found her sitting on a chair in the back parlour, with\r\nher hair over her face, sobbing and crying as though her heart would\r\nbreak. She said she had been frightened in the morning by a man who had\r\npretended to be a customer, and had threatened her unless she gave him\r\nsome things, and she had had to give them to him in order to save\r\nherself from violence; she had been in hysterics ever since the man had\r\ngone. This was her story, but her speech was so incoherent that it was\r\nnot easy to make out what she said. Ernest knew she was with child, and\r\nthinking this might have something to do with the matter, would have\r\nsent for a doctor if Ellen had not begged him not to do so.\r\n\r\nAnyone who had had experience of drunken people would have seen at a\r\nglance what the matter was, but my hero knew nothing about\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94nothing, that is to say, about the drunkenness of the habitual\r\ndrunkard, which shows itself very differently from that of one who gets\r\ndrunk only once in a way. The idea that his wife could drink had never\r\neven crossed his mind, indeed she always made a fuss about taking more\r\nthan a very little beer, and never touched spirits. He did not know\r\nmuch more about hysterics than he did about drunkenness, but he had\r\nalways heard that women who were about to become mothers were liable to\r\nbe easily upset and were often rather flighty, so he was not greatly\r\nsurprised, and thought he had settled the matter by registering the\r\ndiscovery that being about to become a father has its troublesome as\r\nwell as its pleasant side.\r\n\r\nThe great change in Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s life consequent upon her meeting Ernest and\r\ngetting married had for a time actually sobered her by shaking her out\r\nof her old ways. Drunkenness is so much a matter of habit, and habit so\r\nmuch a matter of surroundings, that if you completely change the\r\nsurroundings you will sometimes get rid of the drunkenness altogether.\r\nEllen had intended remaining always sober henceforward, and never\r\nhaving had so long a steady fit before, believed she was now cured. So\r\nshe perhaps would have been if she had seen none of her old\r\nacquaintances. When, however, her new life was beginning to lose its\r\nnewness, and when her old acquaintances came to see her, her present\r\nsurroundings became more like her past, and on this she herself began\r\nto get like her past too. At first she only got a little tipsy and\r\nstruggled against a relapse; but it was no use, she soon lost the heart\r\nto fight, and now her object was not to try and keep sober, but to get\r\ngin without her husband\xe2\x80\x99s finding it out.\r\n\r\nSo the hysterics continued, and she managed to make her husband still\r\nthink that they were due to her being about to become a mother. The\r\nworse her attacks were, the more devoted he became in his attention to\r\nher. At last he insisted that a doctor should see her. The doctor of\r\ncourse took in the situation at a glance, but said nothing to Ernest\r\nexcept in such a guarded way that he did not understand the hints that\r\nwere thrown out to him. He was much too downright and matter of fact to\r\nbe quick at taking hints of this sort. He hoped that as soon as his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s confinement was over she would regain her health and had no\r\nthought save how to spare her as far as possible till that happy time\r\nshould come.\r\n\r\nIn the mornings she was generally better, as long that is to say as\r\nErnest remained at home; but he had to go out buying, and on his return\r\nwould generally find that she had had another attack as soon as he had\r\nleft the house. At times she would laugh and cry for half an hour\r\ntogether, at others she would lie in a semi-comatose state upon the\r\nbed, and when he came back he would find that the shop had been\r\nneglected and all the work of the household left undone. Still he took\r\nit for granted that this was all part of the usual course when women\r\nwere going to become mothers, and when Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s share of the work\r\nsettled down more and more upon his own shoulders he did it all and\r\ndrudged away without a murmur. Nevertheless, he began to feel in a\r\nvague way more as he had felt in Ashpit Place, at Roughborough, or at\r\nBattersby, and to lose the buoyancy of spirits which had made another\r\nman of him during the first six months of his married life.\r\n\r\nIt was not only that he had to do so much household work, for even the\r\ncooking, cleaning up slops, bed-making and fire-lighting ere long\r\ndevolved upon him, but his business no longer prospered. He could buy\r\nas hitherto, but Ellen seemed unable to sell as she had sold at first.\r\nThe fact was that she sold as well as ever, but kept back part of the\r\nproceeds in order to buy gin, and she did this more and more till even\r\nthe unsuspecting Ernest ought to have seen that she was not telling the\r\ntruth. When she sold better\xe2\x80\x94that is to say when she did not think it\r\nsafe to keep back more than a certain amount, she got money out of him\r\non the plea that she had a longing for this or that, and that it would\r\nperhaps irreparably damage the baby if her longing was denied her. All\r\nseemed right, reasonable, and unavoidable, nevertheless Ernest saw that\r\nuntil the confinement was over he was likely to have a hard time of it.\r\nAll however would then come right again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the month of September 1860 a girl was born, and Ernest was proud\r\nand happy. The birth of the child, and a rather alarming talk which the\r\ndoctor had given to Ellen sobered her for a few weeks, and it really\r\nseemed as though his hopes were about to be fulfilled. The expenses of\r\nhis wife\xe2\x80\x99s confinement were heavy, and he was obliged to trench upon\r\nhis savings, but he had no doubt about soon recouping this now that\r\nEllen was herself again; for a time indeed his business did revive a\r\nlittle, nevertheless it seemed as though the interruption to his\r\nprosperity had in some way broken the spell of good luck which had\r\nattended him in the outset; he was still sanguine, however, and worked\r\nnight and day with a will, but there was no more music, or reading, or\r\nwriting now. His Sunday outings were put a stop to, and but for the\r\nfirst floor being let to myself, he would have lost his citadel there\r\ntoo, but he seldom used it, for Ellen had to wait more and more upon\r\nthe baby, and, as a consequence, Ernest had to wait more and more upon\r\nEllen.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, about a couple of months after the baby had been born,\r\nand just as my unhappy hero was beginning to feel more hopeful and\r\ntherefore better able to bear his burdens, he returned from a sale, and\r\nfound Ellen in the same hysterical condition that he had found her in\r\nin the spring. She said she was again with child, and Ernest still\r\nbelieved her.\r\n\r\nAll the troubles of the preceding six months began again then and\r\nthere, and grew worse and worse continually. Money did not come in\r\nquickly, for Ellen cheated him by keeping it back, and dealing\r\nimproperly with the goods he bought. When it did come in she got it out\r\nof him as before on pretexts which it seemed inhuman to inquire into.\r\nIt was always the same story. By and by a new feature began to show\r\nitself. Ernest had inherited his father\xe2\x80\x99s punctuality and exactness as\r\nregards money; he liked to know the worst of what he had to pay at\r\nonce; he hated having expenses sprung upon him which if not foreseen\r\nmight and ought to have been so, but now bills began to be brought to\r\nhim for things ordered by Ellen without his knowledge, or for which he\r\nhad already given her the money. This was awful, and even Ernest\r\nturned. When he remonstrated with her\xe2\x80\x94not for having bought the things,\r\nbut for having said nothing to him about the moneys being owing\xe2\x80\x94Ellen\r\nmet him with hysteria and there was a scene. She had now pretty well\r\nforgotten the hard times she had known when she had been on her own\r\nresources and reproached him downright with having married her\xe2\x80\x94on that\r\nmoment the scales fell from Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s eyes as they had fallen when\r\nTowneley had said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no.\xe2\x80\x9d He said nothing, but he woke up once\r\nfor all to the fact that he had made a mistake in marrying. A touch had\r\nagain come which had revealed him to himself.\r\n\r\nHe went upstairs to the disused citadel, flung himself into the\r\narm-chair, and covered his face with his hands.\r\n\r\nHe still did not know that his wife drank, but he could no longer trust\r\nher, and his dream of happiness was over. He had been saved from the\r\nChurch\xe2\x80\x94so as by fire, but still saved\xe2\x80\x94but what could now save him from\r\nhis marriage? He had made the same mistake that he had made in wedding\r\nhimself to the Church, but with a hundred times worse results. He had\r\nlearnt nothing by experience: he was an Esau\xe2\x80\x94one of those wretches\r\nwhose hearts the Lord had hardened, who, having ears, heard not, having\r\neyes saw not, and who should find no place for repentance though they\r\nsought it even with tears.\r\n\r\nYet had he not on the whole tried to find out what the ways of God\r\nwere, and to follow them in singleness of heart? To a certain extent,\r\nyes; but he had not been thorough; he had not given up all for God. He\r\nknew that very well he had done little as compared with what he might\r\nand ought to have done, but still if he was being punished for this,\r\nGod was a hard taskmaster, and one, too, who was continually pouncing\r\nout upon his unhappy creatures from ambuscades. In marrying Ellen he\r\nhad meant to avoid a life of sin, and to take the course he believed to\r\nbe moral and right. With his antecedents and surroundings it was the\r\nmost natural thing in the world for him to have done, yet in what a\r\nfrightful position had not his morality landed him. Could any amount of\r\nimmorality have placed him in a much worse one? What was morality worth\r\nif it was not that which on the whole brought a man peace at the last,\r\nand could anyone have reasonable certainty that marriage would do this?\r\nIt seemed to him that in his attempt to be moral he had been following\r\na devil which had disguised itself as an angel of light. But if so,\r\nwhat ground was there on which a man might rest the sole of his foot\r\nand tread in reasonable safety?\r\n\r\nHe was still too young to reach the answer, \xe2\x80\x9cOn common sense\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94an answer\r\nwhich he would have felt to be unworthy of anyone who had an ideal\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\nHowever this might be, it was plain that he had now done for himself.\r\nIt had been thus with him all his life. If there had come at any time a\r\ngleam of sunshine and hope, it was to be obscured immediately\xe2\x80\x94why,\r\nprison was happier than this! There, at any rate, he had had no money\r\nanxieties, and these were beginning to weigh upon him now with all\r\ntheir horrors. He was happier even now than he had been at Battersby or\r\nat Roughborough, and he would not now go back, even if he could, to his\r\nCambridge life, but for all that the outlook was so gloomy, in fact so\r\nhopeless, that he felt as if he could have only too gladly gone to\r\nsleep and died in his arm-chair once for all.\r\n\r\nAs he was musing thus and looking upon the wreck of his hopes\xe2\x80\x94for he\r\nsaw well enough that as long as he was linked to Ellen he should never\r\nrise as he had dreamed of doing\xe2\x80\x94he heard a noise below, and presently a\r\nneighbour ran upstairs and entered his room hurriedly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood gracious, Mr Pontifex,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cfor goodness\xe2\x80\x99 sake come\r\ndown quickly and help. O Mrs Pontifex is took with the horrors\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s orkard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe unhappy man came down as he was bid and found his wife mad with\r\n_delirium tremens_.\r\n\r\nHe knew all now. The neighbours thought he must have known that his\r\nwife drank all along, but Ellen had been so artful, and he so simple,\r\nthat, as I have said, he had had no suspicion. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman\r\nwho had summoned him, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99ll drink anything she can stand up and pay\r\nher money for.\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest could hardly believe his ears, but when the\r\ndoctor had seen his wife and she had become more quiet, he went over to\r\nthe public house hard by and made enquiries, the result of which\r\nrendered further doubt impossible. The publican took the opportunity to\r\npresent my hero with a bill of several pounds for bottles of spirits\r\nsupplied to his wife, and what with his wife\xe2\x80\x99s confinement and the way\r\nbusiness had fallen off, he had not the money to pay with, for the sum\r\nexceeded the remnant of his savings.\r\n\r\nHe came to me\xe2\x80\x94not for money, but to tell me his miserable story. I had\r\nseen for some time that there was something wrong, and had suspected\r\npretty shrewdly what the matter was, but of course I said nothing.\r\nErnest and I had been growing apart for some time. I was vexed at his\r\nhaving married, and he knew I was vexed, though I did my best to hide\r\nit.\r\n\r\nA man\xe2\x80\x99s friendships are, like his will, invalidated by marriage\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nthey are also no less invalidated by the marriage of his friends. The\r\nrift in friendship which invariably makes its appearance on the\r\nmarriage of either of the parties to it was fast widening, as it no\r\nless invariably does, into the great gulf which is fixed between the\r\nmarried and the unmarried, and I was beginning to leave my _prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9_ to\r\na fate with which I had neither right nor power to meddle. In fact I\r\nhad begun to feel him rather a burden; I did not so much mind this when\r\nI could be of use, but I grudged it when I could be of none. He had\r\nmade his bed and he must lie upon it. Ernest had felt all this and had\r\nseldom come near me till now, one evening late in 1860, he called on\r\nme, and with a very woebegone face told me his troubles.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I found that he no longer liked his wife I forgave him at\r\nonce, and was as much interested in him as ever. There is nothing an\r\nold bachelor likes better than to find a young married man who wishes\r\nhe had not got married\xe2\x80\x94especially when the case is such an extreme one\r\nthat he need not pretend to hope that matters will come all right\r\nagain, or encourage his young friend to make the best of it.\r\n\r\nI was myself in favour of a separation, and said I would make Ellen an\r\nallowance myself\xe2\x80\x94of course intending that it should come out of\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x99s money; but he would not hear of this. He had married Ellen, he\r\nsaid, and he must try to reform her. He hated it, but he must try; and\r\nfinding him as usual very obstinate I was obliged to acquiesce, though\r\nwith little confidence as to the result. I was vexed at seeing him\r\nwaste himself upon such a barren task, and again began to feel him\r\nburdensome. I am afraid I showed this, for he again avoided me for some\r\ntime, and, indeed, for many months I hardly saw him at all.\r\n\r\nEllen remained very ill for some days, and then gradually recovered.\r\nErnest hardly left her till she was out of danger. When she had\r\nrecovered he got the doctor to tell her that if she had such another\r\nattack she would certainly die; this so frightened her that she took\r\nthe pledge.\r\n\r\nThen he became more hopeful again. When she was sober she was just what\r\nshe was during the first days of her married life, and so quick was he\r\nto forget pain, that after a few days he was as fond of her as ever.\r\nBut Ellen could not forgive him for knowing what he did. She knew that\r\nhe was on the watch to shield her from temptation, and though he did\r\nhis best to make her think that he had no further uneasiness about her,\r\nshe found the burden of her union with respectability grow more and\r\nmore heavy upon her, and looked back more and more longingly upon the\r\nlawless freedom of the life she had led before she met her husband.\r\n\r\nI will dwell no longer on this part of my story. During the spring\r\nmonths of 1861 she kept straight\xe2\x80\x94she had had her fling of dissipation,\r\nand this, together with the impression made upon her by her having\r\ntaken the pledge, tamed her for a while. The shop went fairly well, and\r\nenabled Ernest to make the two ends meet. In the spring and summer of\r\n1861 he even put by a little money again. In the autumn his wife was\r\nconfined of a boy\xe2\x80\x94a very fine one, so everyone said. She soon\r\nrecovered, and Ernest was beginning to breathe freely and be almost\r\nsanguine when, without a word of warning, the storm broke again. He\r\nreturned one afternoon about two years after his marriage, and found\r\nhis wife lying upon the floor insensible.\r\n\r\nFrom this time he became hopeless, and began to go visibly down hill.\r\nHe had been knocked about too much, and the luck had gone too long\r\nagainst him. The wear and tear of the last three years had told on him,\r\nand though not actually ill he was overworked, below par, and unfit for\r\nany further burden.\r\n\r\nHe struggled for a while to prevent himself from finding this out, but\r\nfacts were too strong for him. Again he called on me and told me what\r\nhad happened. I was glad the crisis had come; I was sorry for Ellen,\r\nbut a complete separation from her was the only chance for her husband.\r\nEven after this last outbreak he was unwilling to consent to this, and\r\ntalked nonsense about dying at his post, till I got tired of him. Each\r\ntime I saw him the old gloom had settled more and more deeply upon his\r\nface, and I had about made up my mind to put an end to the situation by\r\na _coup de main_, such as bribing Ellen to run away with somebody else,\r\nor something of that kind, when matters settled themselves as usual in\r\na way which I had not anticipated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winter had been a trying one. Ernest had only paid his way by\r\nselling his piano. With this he seemed to cut away the last link that\r\nconnected him with his earlier life, and to sink once for all into the\r\nsmall shop-keeper. It seemed to him that however low he might sink his\r\npain could not last much longer, for he should simply die if it did.\r\n\r\nHe hated Ellen now, and the pair lived in open want of harmony with\r\neach other. If it had not been for his children, he would have left her\r\nand gone to America, but he could not leave the children with Ellen,\r\nand as for taking them with him he did not know how to do it, nor what\r\nto do with them when he had got them to America. If he had not lost\r\nenergy he would probably in the end have taken the children and gone\r\noff, but his nerve was shaken, so day after day went by and nothing was\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nHe had only got a few shillings in the world now, except the value of\r\nhis stock, which was very little; he could get perhaps \xc2\xa33 or \xc2\xa34 by\r\nselling his music and what few pictures and pieces of furniture still\r\nbelonged to him. He thought of trying to live by his pen, but his\r\nwriting had dropped off long ago; he no longer had an idea in his head.\r\nLook which way he would he saw no hope; the end, if it had not actually\r\ncome, was within easy distance and he was almost face to face with\r\nactual want. When he saw people going about poorly clad, or even\r\nwithout shoes and stockings, he wondered whether within a few months\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntime he too should not have to go about in this way. The remorseless,\r\nresistless hand of fate had caught him in its grip and was dragging him\r\ndown, down, down. Still he staggered on, going his daily rounds, buying\r\nsecond-hand clothes, and spending his evenings in cleaning and mending\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOne morning, as he was returning from a house at the West End where he\r\nhad bought some clothes from one of the servants, he was struck by a\r\nsmall crowd which had gathered round a space that had been railed off\r\non the grass near one of the paths in the Green Park.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely soft spring morning at the end of March, and unusually\r\nbalmy for the time of year; even Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s melancholy was relieved for a\r\nwhile by the look of spring that pervaded earth and sky; but it soon\r\nreturned, and smiling sadly he said to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cIt may bring hope to\r\nothers, but for me there can be no hope henceforth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs these words were in his mind he joined the small crowd who were\r\ngathered round the railings, and saw that they were looking at three\r\nsheep with very small lambs only a day or two old, which had been\r\npenned off for shelter and protection from the others that ranged the\r\npark.\r\n\r\nThey were very pretty, and Londoners so seldom get a chance of seeing\r\nlambs that it was no wonder every one stopped to look at them. Ernest\r\nobserved that no one seemed fonder of them than a great lubberly\r\nbutcher boy, who leaned up against the railings with a tray of meat\r\nupon his shoulder. He was looking at this boy and smiling at the\r\ngrotesqueness of his admiration, when he became aware that he was being\r\nwatched intently by a man in coachman\xe2\x80\x99s livery, who had also stopped to\r\nadmire the lambs, and was leaning against the opposite side of the\r\nenclosure. Ernest knew him in a moment as John, his father\xe2\x80\x99s old\r\ncoachman at Battersby, and went up to him at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Master Ernest,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with his strong northern accent, \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\nthinking of you only this very morning,\xe2\x80\x9d and the pair shook hands\r\nheartily. John was in an excellent place at the West End. He had done\r\nvery well, he said, ever since he had left Battersby, except for the\r\nfirst year or two, and that, he said, with a screw of the face, had\r\nwell nigh broke him.\r\n\r\nErnest asked how this was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d said John, \xe2\x80\x9cI was always main fond of that lass Ellen,\r\nwhom you remember running after, Master Ernest, and giving your watch\r\nto. I expect you haven\xe2\x80\x99t forgotten that day, have you?\xe2\x80\x9d And here he\r\nlaughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know as I be the father of the child she carried away\r\nwith her from Battersby, but I very easily may have been. Anyhow, after\r\nI had left your papa\xe2\x80\x99s place a few days I wrote to Ellen to an address\r\nwe had agreed upon, and told her I would do what I ought to do, and so\r\nI did, for I married her within a month afterwards. Why, Lord love the\r\nman, whatever is the matter with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for as he had spoken the last\r\nfew words of his story Ernest had turned white as a sheet, and was\r\nleaning against the railings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn,\xe2\x80\x9d said my hero, gasping for breath, \xe2\x80\x9care you sure of what you\r\nsay\xe2\x80\x94are you quite sure you really married her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said John, \xe2\x80\x9cI married her before the registrar at\r\nLetchbury on the 15th of August 1851.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me your arm,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ernest, \xe2\x80\x9cand take me into Piccadilly, and put\r\nme into a cab, and come with me at once, if you can spare time, to Mr\r\nOverton\xe2\x80\x99s at the Temple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not think Ernest himself was much more pleased at finding that he\r\nhad never been married than I was. To him, however, the shock of\r\npleasure was positively numbing in its intensity. As he felt his burden\r\nremoved, he reeled for the unaccustomed lightness of his movements; his\r\nposition was so shattered that his identity seemed to have been\r\nshattered also; he was as one waking up from a horrible nightmare to\r\nfind himself safe and sound in bed, but who can hardly even yet believe\r\nthat the room is not full of armed men who are about to spring upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is I,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwho not an hour ago complained that I was\r\nwithout hope. It is I, who for weeks have been railing at fortune, and\r\nsaying that though she smiled on others she never smiled at me. Why,\r\nnever was anyone half so fortunate as I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have been inoculated for marriage, and have\r\nrecovered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI was very fond of her till she took to drinking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps; but is it not Tennyson who has said: \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis better to have\r\nloved and lost, than never to have lost at all\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are an inveterate bachelor,\xe2\x80\x9d was the rejoinder.\r\n\r\nThen we had a long talk with John, to whom I gave a \xc2\xa35 note upon the\r\nspot. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cEllen had used to drink at Battersby; the cook had\r\ntaught her; he had known it, but was so fond of her, that he had\r\nchanced it and married her to save her from the streets and in the hope\r\nof being able to keep her straight. She had done with him just as she\r\nhad done with Ernest\xe2\x80\x94made him an excellent wife as long as she kept\r\nsober, but a very bad one afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said John, \xe2\x80\x9ca sweeter-tempered, handier, prettier girl\r\nthan she was in all England, nor one as knows better what a man likes,\r\nand how to make him happy, if you can keep her from drink; but you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t keep her; she\xe2\x80\x99s that artful she\xe2\x80\x99ll get it under your very eyes,\r\nwithout you knowing it. If she can\xe2\x80\x99t get any more of your things to\r\npawn or sell, she\xe2\x80\x99ll steal her neighbours\xe2\x80\x99. That\xe2\x80\x99s how she got into\r\ntrouble first when I was with her. During the six months she was in\r\nprison I should have felt happy if I had not known she would come out\r\nagain. And then she did come out, and before she had been free a\r\nfortnight, she began shop-lifting and going on the loose again\xe2\x80\x94and all\r\nto get money to drink with. So seeing I could do nothing with her and\r\nthat she was just a-killing of me, I left her, and came up to London,\r\nand went into service again, and I did not know what had become of her\r\ntill you and Mr Ernest here told me. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll neither of you say\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve seen me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe assured him we would keep his counsel, and then he left us, with\r\nmany protestations of affection towards Ernest, to whom he had been\r\nalways much attached.\r\n\r\nWe talked the situation over, and decided first to get the children\r\naway, and then to come to terms with Ellen concerning their future\r\ncustody; as for herself, I proposed that we should make her an\r\nallowance of, say, a pound a week to be paid so long as she gave no\r\ntrouble. Ernest did not see where the pound a week was to come from, so\r\nI eased his mind by saying I would pay it myself. Before the day was\r\ntwo hours older we had got the children, about whom Ellen had always\r\nappeared to be indifferent, and had confided them to the care of my\r\nlaundress, a good motherly sort of woman, who took to them and to whom\r\nthey took at once.\r\n\r\nThen came the odious task of getting rid of their unhappy mother.\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x99s heart smote him at the notion of the shock the break-up would\r\nbe to her. He was always thinking that people had a claim upon him for\r\nsome inestimable service they had rendered him, or for some irreparable\r\nmischief done to them by himself; the case however was so clear, that\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x99s scruples did not offer serious resistance.\r\n\r\nI did not see why he should have the pain of another interview with his\r\nwife, so I got Mr Ottery to manage the whole business. It turned out\r\nthat we need not have harrowed ourselves so much about the agony of\r\nmind which Ellen would suffer on becoming an outcast again. Ernest saw\r\nMrs Richards, the neighbour who had called him down on the night when\r\nhe had first discovered his wife\xe2\x80\x99s drunkenness, and got from her some\r\ndetails of Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s opinions upon the matter. She did not seem in the\r\nleast conscience-stricken; she said: \xe2\x80\x9cThank goodness, at last!\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nalthough aware that her marriage was not a valid one, evidently\r\nregarded this as a mere detail which it would not be worth anybody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhile to go into more particularly. As regards his breaking with her,\r\nshe said it was a good job both for him and for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis life,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t suit me. Ernest is too good for me;\r\nhe wants a woman as shall be a bit better than me, and I want a man\r\nthat shall be a bit worse than him. We should have got on all very well\r\nif we had not lived together as married folks, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve been used to\r\nhave a little place of my own, however small, for a many years, and I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want Ernest, or any other man, always hanging about it. Besides\r\nhe is too steady: his being in prison hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done him a bit of\r\ngood\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s just as grave as those as have never been in prison at all,\r\nand he never swears nor curses, come what may; it makes me afeared of\r\nhim, and therefore I drink the worse. What us poor girls wants is not\r\nto be jumped up all of a sudden and made honest women of; this is too\r\nmuch for us and throws us off our perch; what we wants is a regular\r\nfriend or two, who\xe2\x80\x99ll just keep us from starving, and force us to be\r\ngood for a bit together now and again. That\xe2\x80\x99s about as much as we can\r\nstand. He may have the children; he can do better for them than I can;\r\nand as for his money, he may give it or keep it as he likes, he\xe2\x80\x99s never\r\ndone me any harm, and I shall let him alone; but if he means me to have\r\nit, I suppose I\xe2\x80\x99d better have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94And have it she did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ernest to himself again when the arrangement was\r\nconcluded, \xe2\x80\x9cam the man who thought himself unlucky!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI may as well say here all that need be said further about Ellen. For\r\nthe next three years she used to call regularly at Mr Ottery\xe2\x80\x99s every\r\nMonday morning for her pound. She was always neatly dressed, and looked\r\nso quiet and pretty that no one would have suspected her antecedents.\r\nAt first she wanted sometimes to anticipate, but after three or four\r\nineffectual attempts\xe2\x80\x94on each of which occasions she told a most pitiful\r\nstory\xe2\x80\x94she gave it up and took her money regularly without a word. Once\r\nshe came with a bad black eye, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich a boy had throwed a stone and hit\r\nher by mistake\xe2\x80\x9d; but on the whole she looked pretty much the same at\r\nthe end of the three years as she had done at the beginning. Then she\r\nexplained that she was going to be married again. Mr Ottery saw her on\r\nthis, and pointed out to her that she would very likely be again\r\ncommitting bigamy by doing so. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may call it what you like,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am going off to America with Bill the butcher\xe2\x80\x99s man,\r\nand we hope Mr Pontifex won\xe2\x80\x99t be too hard on us and stop the\r\nallowance.\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest was little likely to do this, so the pair went in\r\npeace. I believe it was Bill who had blacked her eye, and she liked him\r\nall the better for it.\r\n\r\nFrom one or two little things I have been able to gather that the\r\ncouple got on very well together, and that in Bill she has found a\r\npartner better suited to her than either John or Ernest. On his\r\nbirthday Ernest generally receives an envelope with an American\r\npost-mark containing a book-marker with a flaunting text upon it, or a\r\nmoral kettle-holder, or some other similar small token of recognition,\r\nbut no letter. Of the children she has taken no notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nErnest was now well turned twenty-six years old, and in little more\r\nthan another year and a half would come into possession of his money. I\r\nsaw no reason for letting him have it earlier than the date fixed by\r\nMiss Pontifex herself; at the same time I did not like his continuing\r\nthe shop at Blackfriars after the present crisis. It was not till now\r\nthat I fully understood how much he had suffered, nor how nearly his\r\nsupposed wife\xe2\x80\x99s habits had brought him to actual want.\r\n\r\nI had indeed noted the old wan worn look settling upon his face, but\r\nwas either too indolent or too hopeless of being able to sustain a\r\nprotracted and successful warfare with Ellen to extend the sympathy and\r\nmake the inquiries which I suppose I ought to have made. And yet I\r\nhardly know what I could have done, for nothing short of his finding\r\nout what he had found out would have detached him from his wife, and\r\nnothing could do him much good as long as he continued to live with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAfter all I suppose I was right; I suppose things did turn out all the\r\nbetter in the end for having been left to settle themselves\xe2\x80\x94at any rate\r\nwhether they did or did not, the whole thing was in too great a muddle\r\nfor me to venture to tackle it so long as Ellen was upon the scene;\r\nnow, however, that she was removed, all my interest in my godson\r\nrevived, and I turned over many times in my mind, what I had better do\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nIt was now three and a half years since he had come up to London and\r\nbegun to live, so to speak, upon his own account. Of these years, six\r\nmonths had been spent as a clergyman, six months in gaol, and for two\r\nand a half years he had been acquiring twofold experience in the ways\r\nof business and of marriage. He had failed, I may say, in everything\r\nthat he had undertaken, even as a prisoner; yet his defeats had been\r\nalways, as it seemed to me, something so like victories, that I was\r\nsatisfied of his being worth all the pains I could bestow upon him; my\r\nonly fear was lest I should meddle with him when it might be better for\r\nhim to be let alone. On the whole I concluded that a three and a half\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x99 apprenticeship to a rough life was enough; the shop had done\r\nmuch for him; it had kept him going after a fashion, when he was in\r\ngreat need; it had thrown him upon his own resources, and taught him to\r\nsee profitable openings all around him, where a few months before he\r\nwould have seen nothing but insuperable difficulties; it had enlarged\r\nhis sympathies by making him understand the lower classes, and not\r\nconfining his view of life to that taken by gentlemen only. When he\r\nwent about the streets and saw the books outside the second-hand\r\nbook-stalls, the bric-a-brac in the curiosity shops, and the infinite\r\ncommercial activity which is omnipresent around us, he understood it\r\nand sympathised with it as he could never have done if he had not kept\r\na shop himself.\r\n\r\nHe has often told me that when he used to travel on a railway that\r\noverlooked populous suburbs, and looked down upon street after street\r\nof dingy houses, he used to wonder what kind of people lived in them,\r\nwhat they did and felt, and how far it was like what he did and felt\r\nhimself. Now, he said he knew all about it. I am not very familiar with\r\nthe writer of the Odyssey (who, by the way, I suspect strongly of\r\nhaving been a clergyman), but he assuredly hit the right nail on the\r\nhead when he epitomised his typical wise man as knowing \xe2\x80\x9cthe ways and\r\nfarings of many men.\xe2\x80\x9d What culture is comparable to this? What a lie,\r\nwhat a sickly debilitating debauch did not Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s school and\r\nuniversity career now seem to him, in comparison with his life in\r\nprison and as a tailor in Blackfriars. I have heard him say he would\r\nhave gone through all he had suffered if it were only for the deeper\r\ninsight it gave him into the spirit of the Grecian and the Surrey\r\npantomimes. What confidence again in his own power to swim if thrown\r\ninto deep waters had not he won through his experiences during the last\r\nthree years!\r\n\r\nBut, as I have said, I thought my godson had now seen as much of the\r\nunder currents of life as was likely to be of use to him, and that it\r\nwas time he began to live in a style more suitable to his prospects.\r\nHis aunt had wished him to kiss the soil, and he had kissed it with a\r\nvengeance; but I did not like the notion of his coming suddenly from\r\nthe position of a small shop-keeper to that of a man with an income of\r\nbetween three and four thousand a year. Too sudden a jump from bad\r\nfortune to good is just as dangerous as one from good to bad; besides,\r\npoverty is very wearing; it is a quasi-embryonic condition, through\r\nwhich a man had better pass if he is to hold his later developments\r\nsecurely, but like measles or scarlet fever he had better have it\r\nmildly and get it over early.\r\n\r\nNo man is safe from losing every penny he has in the world, unless he\r\nhas had his facer. How often do I not hear middle-aged women and quiet\r\nfamily men say that they have no speculative tendency; _they_ never had\r\ntouched, and never would touch, any but the very soundest, best reputed\r\ninvestments, and as for unlimited liability, oh dear! dear! and they\r\nthrow up their hands and eyes.\r\n\r\nWhenever a person is heard to talk thus he may be recognised as the\r\neasy prey of the first adventurer who comes across him; he will\r\ncommonly, indeed, wind up his discourse by saying that in spite of all\r\nhis natural caution, and his well knowing how foolish speculation is,\r\nyet there are some investments which are called speculative but in\r\nreality are not so, and he will pull out of his pocket the prospectus\r\nof a Cornish gold mine. It is only on having actually lost money that\r\none realises what an awful thing the loss of it is, and finds out how\r\neasily it is lost by those who venture out of the middle of the most\r\nbeaten path. Ernest had had his facer, as he had had his attack of\r\npoverty, young, and sufficiently badly for a sensible man to be little\r\nlikely to forget it. I can fancy few pieces of good fortune greater\r\nthan this as happening to any man, provided, of course, that he is not\r\ndamaged irretrievably.\r\n\r\nSo strongly do I feel on this subject that if I had my way I would have\r\na speculation master attached to every school. The boys would be\r\nencouraged to read the _Money Market Review_, the _Railway News_, and\r\nall the best financial papers, and should establish a stock exchange\r\namongst themselves in which pence should stand as pounds. Then let them\r\nsee how this making haste to get rich moneys out in actual practice.\r\nThere might be a prize awarded by the head-master to the most prudent\r\ndealer, and the boys who lost their money time after time should be\r\ndismissed. Of course if any boy proved to have a genius for speculation\r\nand made money\xe2\x80\x94well and good, let him speculate by all means.\r\n\r\nIf Universities were not the worst teachers in the world I should like\r\nto see professorships of speculation established at Oxford and\r\nCambridge. When I reflect, however, that the only things worth doing\r\nwhich Oxford and Cambridge can do well are cooking, cricket, rowing and\r\ngames, of which there is no professorship, I fear that the\r\nestablishment of a professorial chair would end in teaching young men\r\nneither how to speculate, nor how not to speculate, but would simply\r\nturn them out as bad speculators.\r\n\r\nI heard of one case in which a father actually carried my idea into\r\npractice. He wanted his son to learn how little confidence was to be\r\nplaced in glowing prospectuses and flaming articles, and found him five\r\nhundred pounds which he was to invest according to his lights. The\r\nfather expected he would lose the money; but it did not turn out so in\r\npractice, for the boy took so much pains and played so cautiously that\r\nthe money kept growing and growing till the father took it away again,\r\nincrement and all\xe2\x80\x94as he was pleased to say, in self defence.\r\n\r\nI had made my own mistakes with money about the year 1846, when\r\neveryone else was making them. For a few years I had been so scared and\r\nhad suffered so severely, that when (owing to the good advice of the\r\nbroker who had advised my father and grandfather before me) I came out\r\nin the end a winner and not a loser, I played no more pranks, but kept\r\nhenceforward as nearly in the middle of the middle rut as I could. I\r\ntried in fact to keep my money rather than to make more of it. I had\r\ndone with Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s money as with my own\xe2\x80\x94that is to say I had let it\r\nalone after investing it in Midland ordinary stock according to Miss\r\nPontifex\xe2\x80\x99s instructions. No amount of trouble would have been likely to\r\nhave increased my godson\xe2\x80\x99s estate one half so much as it had increased\r\nwithout my taking any trouble at all.\r\n\r\nMidland stock at the end of August 1850, when I sold out Miss\r\nPontifex\xe2\x80\x99s debentures, stood at \xc2\xa332 per \xc2\xa3100. I invested the whole of\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa315,000 at this price, and did not change the investment till\r\na few months before the time of which I have been writing lately\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nis to say until September 1861. I then sold at \xc2\xa3129 per share and\r\ninvested in London and North-Western ordinary stock, which I was\r\nadvised was more likely to rise than Midlands now were. I bought the\r\nLondon and North-Western stock at \xc2\xa393 per \xc2\xa3100, and my godson now in\r\n1882 still holds it.\r\n\r\nThe original \xc2\xa315,000 had increased in eleven years to over \xc2\xa360,000; the\r\naccumulated interest, which, of course, I had re-invested, had come to\r\nabout \xc2\xa310,000 more, so that Ernest was then worth over \xc2\xa370,000. At\r\npresent he is worth nearly double that sum, and all as the result of\r\nleaving well alone.\r\n\r\nLarge as his property now was, it ought to be increased still further\r\nduring the year and a half that remained of his minority, so that on\r\ncoming of age he ought to have an income of at least \xc2\xa33500 a year.\r\n\r\nI wished him to understand book-keeping by double entry. I had myself\r\nas a young man been compelled to master this not very difficult art;\r\nhaving acquired it, I have become enamoured of it, and consider it the\r\nmost necessary branch of any young man\xe2\x80\x99s education after reading and\r\nwriting. I was determined, therefore, that Ernest should master it, and\r\nproposed that he should become my steward, book-keeper, and the manager\r\nof my hoardings, for so I called the sum which my ledger showed to have\r\naccumulated from \xc2\xa315,000 to \xc2\xa370,000. I told him I was going to begin to\r\nspend the income as soon as it had amounted up to \xc2\xa380,000.\r\n\r\nA few days after Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s discovery that he was still a bachelor, while\r\nhe was still at the very beginning of the honeymoon, as it were, of his\r\nrenewed unmarried life, I broached my scheme, desired him to give up\r\nhis shop, and offered him \xc2\xa3300 a year for managing (so far indeed as it\r\nrequired any managing) his own property. This \xc2\xa3300 a year, I need\r\nhardly say, I made him charge to the estate.\r\n\r\nIf anything had been wanting to complete his happiness it was this.\r\nHere, within three or four days he found himself freed from one of the\r\nmost hideous, hopeless _liaisons_ imaginable, and at the same time\r\nraised from a life of almost squalor to the enjoyment of what would to\r\nhim be a handsome income.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA pound a week,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cfor Ellen, and the rest for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will charge Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s pound a week to the estate also.\r\nYou must have a clear \xc2\xa3300 for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI fixed upon this sum, because it was the one which Mr Disraeli gave\r\nConingsby when Coningsby was at the lowest ebb of his fortunes. Mr\r\nDisraeli evidently thought \xc2\xa3300 a year the smallest sum on which\r\nConingsby could be expected to live, and make the two ends meet; with\r\nthis, however, he thought his hero could manage to get along for a year\r\nor two. In 1862, of which I am now writing, prices had risen, though\r\nnot so much as they have since done; on the other hand Ernest had had\r\nless expensive antecedents than Coningsby, so on the whole I thought\r\n\xc2\xa3300 a year would be about the right thing for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question now arose what was to be done with the children. I\r\nexplained to Ernest that their expenses must be charged to the estate,\r\nand showed him how small a hole all the various items I proposed to\r\ncharge would make in the income at my disposal. He was beginning to\r\nmake difficulties, when I quieted him by pointing out that the money\r\nhad all come to me from his aunt, over his own head, and reminded him\r\nthere had been an understanding between her and me that I should do\r\nmuch as I was doing, if occasion should arise.\r\n\r\nHe wanted his children to be brought up in the fresh pure air, and\r\namong other children who were happy and contented; but being still\r\nignorant of the fortune that awaited him, he insisted that they should\r\npass their earlier years among the poor rather than the rich. I\r\nremonstrated, but he was very decided about it; and when I reflected\r\nthat they were illegitimate, I was not sure but that what Ernest\r\nproposed might be as well for everyone in the end. They were still so\r\nyoung that it did not much matter where they were, so long as they were\r\nwith kindly decent people, and in a healthy neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be just as unkind to my children,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cas my grandfather\r\nwas to my father, or my father to me. If they did not succeed in making\r\ntheir children love them, neither shall I. I say to myself that I\r\nshould like to do so, but so did they. I can make sure that they shall\r\nnot know how much they would have hated me if they had had much to do\r\nwith me, but this is all I can do. If I must ruin their prospects, let\r\nme do so at a reasonable time before they are old enough to feel it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe mused a little and added with a laugh:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man first quarrels with his father about three-quarters of a year\r\nbefore he is born. It is then he insists on setting up a separate\r\nestablishment; when this has been once agreed to, the more complete the\r\nseparation for ever after the better for both.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he said more\r\nseriously: \xe2\x80\x9cI want to put the children where they will be well and\r\nhappy, and where they will not be betrayed into the misery of false\r\nexpectations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the end he remembered that on his Sunday walks he had more than once\r\nseen a couple who lived on the waterside a few miles below Gravesend,\r\njust where the sea was beginning, and who he thought would do. They had\r\na family of their own fast coming on and the children seemed to thrive;\r\nboth father and mother indeed were comfortable well grown folks, in\r\nwhose hands young people would be likely to have as fair a chance of\r\ncoming to a good development as in those of any whom he knew.\r\n\r\nWe went down to see this couple, and as I thought no less well of them\r\nthan Ernest did, we offered them a pound a week to take the children\r\nand bring them up as though they were their own. They jumped at the\r\noffer, and in another day or two we brought the children down and left\r\nthem, feeling that we had done as well as we could by them, at any rate\r\nfor the present. Then Ernest sent his small stock of goods to\r\nDebenham\xe2\x80\x99s, gave up the house he had taken two and a half years\r\npreviously, and returned to civilisation.\r\n\r\nI had expected that he would now rapidly recover, and was disappointed\r\nto see him get as I thought decidedly worse. Indeed, before long I\r\nthought him looking so ill that I insisted on his going with me to\r\nconsult one of the most eminent doctors in London. This gentleman said\r\nthere was no acute disease but that my young friend was suffering from\r\nnervous prostration, the result of long and severe mental suffering,\r\nfrom which there was no remedy except time, prosperity and rest.\r\n\r\nHe said that Ernest must have broken down later on, but that he might\r\nhave gone on for some months yet. It was the suddenness of the relief\r\nfrom tension which had knocked him over now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCross him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cat once. Crossing is the great medical\r\ndiscovery of the age. Shake him out of himself by shaking something\r\nelse into him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had not told him that money was no object to us and I think he had\r\nreckoned me up as not over rich. He continued:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeeing is a mode of touching, touching is a mode of feeding, feeding\r\nis a mode of assimilation, assimilation is a mode of recreation and\r\nreproduction, and this is crossing\xe2\x80\x94shaking yourself into something else\r\nand something else into you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke laughingly, but it was plain he was serious. He continued:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople are always coming to me who want crossing, or change, if you\r\nprefer it, and who I know have not money enough to let them get away\r\nfrom London. This has set me thinking how I can best cross them even if\r\nthey cannot leave home, and I have made a list of cheap London\r\namusements which I recommend to my patients; none of them cost more\r\nthan a few shillings or take more than half a day or a day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI explained that there was no occasion to consider money in this case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad of it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, still laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cThe homoeopathists use\r\n_aurum_ as a medicine, but they do not give it in large doses enough;\r\nif you can dose your young friend with this pretty freely you will soon\r\nbring him round. However, Mr Pontifex is not well enough to stand so\r\ngreat a change as going abroad yet; from what you tell me I should\r\nthink he had had as much change lately as is good for him. If he were\r\nto go abroad now he would probably be taken seriously ill within a\r\nweek. We must wait till he has recovered tone a little more. I will\r\nbegin by ringing my London changes on him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thought a little and then said:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have found the Zoological Gardens of service to many of my patients.\r\nI should prescribe for Mr Pontifex a course of the larger mammals.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t let him think he is taking them medicinally, but let him go to\r\ntheir house twice a week for a fortnight, and stay with the\r\nhippopotamus, the rhinoceros, and the elephants, till they begin to\r\nbore him. I find these beasts do my patients more good than any others.\r\nThe monkeys are not a wide enough cross; they do not stimulate\r\nsufficiently. The larger carnivora are unsympathetic. The reptiles are\r\nworse than useless, and the marsupials are not much better. Birds\r\nagain, except parrots, are not very beneficial; he may look at them now\r\nand again, but with the elephants and the pig tribe generally he should\r\nmix just now as freely as possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, you know, to prevent monotony I should send him, say, to morning\r\nservice at the Abbey before he goes. He need not stay longer than the\r\n_Te Deum_. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why, but _Jubilates_ are seldom satisfactory.\r\nJust let him look in at the Abbey, and sit quietly in Poets\xe2\x80\x99 Corner\r\ntill the main part of the music is over. Let him do this two or three\r\ntimes, not more, before he goes to the Zoo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen next day send him down to Gravesend by boat. By all means let him\r\ngo to the theatres in the evenings\xe2\x80\x94and then let him come to me again in\r\na fortnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHad the doctor been less eminent in his profession I should have\r\ndoubted whether he was in earnest, but I knew him to be a man of\r\nbusiness who would neither waste his own time nor that of his patients.\r\nAs soon as we were out of the house we took a cab to Regent\xe2\x80\x99s Park, and\r\nspent a couple of hours in sauntering round the different houses.\r\nPerhaps it was on account of what the doctor had told me, but I\r\ncertainly became aware of a feeling I had never experienced before. I\r\nmean that I was receiving an influx of new life, or deriving new ways\r\nof looking at life\xe2\x80\x94which is the same thing\xe2\x80\x94by the process. I found the\r\ndoctor quite right in his estimate of the larger mammals as the ones\r\nwhich on the whole were most beneficial, and observed that Ernest, who\r\nhad heard nothing of what the doctor had said to me, lingered\r\ninstinctively in front of them. As for the elephants, especially the\r\nbaby elephant, he seemed to be drinking in large draughts of their\r\nlives to the re-creation and regeneration of his own.\r\n\r\nWe dined in the gardens, and I noticed with pleasure that Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nappetite was already improved. Since this time, whenever I have been a\r\nlittle out of sorts myself I have at once gone up to Regent\xe2\x80\x99s Park, and\r\nhave invariably been benefited. I mention this here in the hope that\r\nsome one or other of my readers may find the hint a useful one.\r\n\r\nAt the end of his fortnight my hero was much better, more so even than\r\nour friend the doctor had expected. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cMr Pontifex may go\r\nabroad, and the sooner the better. Let him stay a couple of months.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the first Ernest had heard about his going abroad, and he\r\ntalked about my not being able to spare him for so long. I soon made\r\nthis all right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is now the beginning of April,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cgo down to Marseilles at\r\nonce, and take steamer to Nice. Then saunter down the Riviera to\r\nGenoa\xe2\x80\x94from Genoa go to Florence, Rome and Naples, and come home by way\r\nof Venice and the Italian lakes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd won\xe2\x80\x99t you come too?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, eagerly.\r\n\r\nI said I did not mind if I did, so we began to make our arrangements\r\nnext morning, and completed them within a very few days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXX\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left by the night mail, crossing from Dover. The night was soft, and\r\nthere was a bright moon upon the sea. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you love the smell of\r\ngrease about the engine of a Channel steamer? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there a lot of hope\r\nin it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ernest to me, for he had been to Normandy one summer as a\r\nboy with his father and mother, and the smell carried him back to days\r\nbefore those in which he had begun to bruise himself against the great\r\noutside world. \xe2\x80\x9cI always think one of the best parts of going abroad is\r\nthe first thud of the piston, and the first gurgling of the water when\r\nthe paddle begins to strike it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was very dreamy getting out at Calais, and trudging about with\r\nluggage in a foreign town at an hour when we were generally both of us\r\nin bed and fast asleep, but we settled down to sleep as soon as we got\r\ninto the railway carriage, and dozed till we had passed Amiens. Then\r\nwaking when the first signs of morning crispness were beginning to show\r\nthemselves, I saw that Ernest was already devouring every object we\r\npassed with quick sympathetic curiousness. There was not a peasant in a\r\nblouse driving his cart betimes along the road to market, not a\r\nsignalman\xe2\x80\x99s wife in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s hat and coat waving a green flag, not\r\na shepherd taking out his sheep to the dewy pastures, not a bank of\r\nopening cowslips as we passed through the railway cuttings, but he was\r\ndrinking it all in with an enjoyment too deep for words. The name of\r\nthe engine that drew us was Mozart, and Ernest liked this too.\r\n\r\nWe reached Paris by six, and had just time to get across the town and\r\ntake a morning express train to Marseilles, but before noon my young\r\nfriend was tired out and had resigned himself to a series of sleeps\r\nwhich were seldom intermitted for more than an hour or so together. He\r\nfought against this for a time, but in the end consoled himself by\r\nsaying it was so nice to have so much pleasure that he could afford to\r\nthrow a lot of it away. Having found a theory on which to justify\r\nhimself, he slept in peace.\r\n\r\nAt Marseilles we rested, and there the excitement of the change proved,\r\nas I had half feared it would, too much for my godson\xe2\x80\x99s still enfeebled\r\nstate. For a few days he was really ill, but after this he righted. For\r\nmy own part I reckon being ill as one of the great pleasures of life,\r\nprovided one is not too ill and is not obliged to work till one is\r\nbetter. I remember being ill once in a foreign hotel myself and how\r\nmuch I enjoyed it. To lie there careless of everything, quiet and warm,\r\nand with no weight upon the mind, to hear the clinking of the plates in\r\nthe far-off kitchen as the scullion rinsed them and put them by; to\r\nwatch the soft shadows come and go upon the ceiling as the sun came out\r\nor went behind a cloud; to listen to the pleasant murmuring of the\r\nfountain in the court below, and the shaking of the bells on the\r\nhorses\xe2\x80\x99 collars and the clink of their hoofs upon the ground as the\r\nflies plagued them; not only to be a lotus-eater but to know that it\r\nwas one\xe2\x80\x99s duty to be a lotus-eater. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cif I\r\ncould only now, having so forgotten care, drop off to sleep for ever,\r\nwould not this be a better piece of fortune than any I can ever hope\r\nfor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course it would, but we would not take it though it were offered us.\r\nNo matter what evil may befall us, we will mostly abide by it and see\r\nit out.\r\n\r\nI could see that Ernest felt much as I had felt myself. He said little,\r\nbut noted everything. Once only did he frighten me. He called me to his\r\nbedside just as it was getting dusk and said in a grave, quiet manner\r\nthat he should like to speak to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I may perhaps never recover from\r\nthis illness, and in case I do not I should like you to know that there\r\nis only one thing which weighs upon me. I refer,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued after a\r\nslight pause, \xe2\x80\x9cto my conduct towards my father and mother. I have been\r\nmuch too good to them. I treated them much too considerately,\xe2\x80\x9d on which\r\nhe broke into a smile which assured me that there was nothing seriously\r\namiss with him.\r\n\r\nOn the walls of his bedroom were a series of French Revolution prints\r\nrepresenting events in the life of Lycurgus. There was \xe2\x80\x9cGrandeur d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa0me\r\nde Lycurgue,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cLycurgue consulte l\xe2\x80\x99oracle,\xe2\x80\x9d and then there was\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCalciope \xc3\xa0 la Cour.\xe2\x80\x9d Under this was written in French and Spanish:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMod\xc3\xa8le de gr\xc3\xa0ce et de beaut\xc3\xa9, la jeune Calciope non moins sage que\r\nbelle avait m\xc3\xa9rit\xc3\xa9 l\xe2\x80\x99estime et l\xe2\x80\x99attachement du vertueux Lycurgue.\r\nVivement \xc3\xa9pris de tant de charmes, l\xe2\x80\x99illustre philosophe la conduisait\r\ndans le temple de Junon, o\xc3\xb9 ils s\xe2\x80\x99unirent par un serment sacr\xc3\xa9. Apr\xc3\xa8s\r\ncette auguste c\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9monie, Lycurgue s\xe2\x80\x99empressa de conduire sa jeune\r\n\xc3\xa9pouse au palais de son fr\xc3\xa8re Polydecte, Roi de Lac\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9mon. Seigneur,\r\nlui dit-il, la vertueuse Calciope vient de recevoir mes voeux aux pieds\r\ndes autels, j\xe2\x80\x99ose vous prier d\xe2\x80\x99approuver cette union. Le Roi t\xc3\xa9moigna\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99abord quelque surprise, mais l\xe2\x80\x99estime qu\xe2\x80\x99il avait pour son fr\xc3\xa8re lui\r\ninspira une r\xc3\xa9ponse pleine de beinveillance. Il s\xe2\x80\x99approcha aussit\xc3\xb4t de\r\nCalciope qu\xe2\x80\x99il embrassa tendrement, combla ensuite Lycurgue de\r\npr\xc3\xa9venances et parut tr\xc3\xa8s satisfait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe called my attention to this and then said somewhat timidly that he\r\nwould rather have married Ellen than Calciope. I saw he was hardening\r\nand made no hesitation about proposing that in another day or two we\r\nshould proceed upon our journey.\r\n\r\nI will not weary the reader by taking him with us over beaten ground.\r\nWe stopped at Siena, Cortona, Orvieto, Perugia and many other cities,\r\nand then after a fortnight passed between Rome and Naples went to the\r\nVenetian provinces and visited all those wondrous towns that lie\r\nbetween the southern slopes of the Alps and the northern ones of the\r\nApennines, coming back at last by the S. Gothard. I doubt whether he\r\nhad enjoyed the trip more than I did myself, but it was not till we\r\nwere on the point of returning that Ernest had recovered strength\r\nenough to be called fairly well, and it was not for many months that he\r\nso completely lost all sense of the wounds which the last four years\r\nhad inflicted on him as to feel as though there were a scar and a scar\r\nonly remaining.\r\n\r\nThey say that when people have lost an arm or a foot they feel pains in\r\nit now and again for a long while after they have lost it. One pain\r\nwhich he had almost forgotten came upon him on his return to England, I\r\nmean the sting of his having been imprisoned. As long as he was only a\r\nsmall shop-keeper his imprisonment mattered nothing; nobody knew of it,\r\nand if they had known they would not have cared; now, however, though\r\nhe was returning to his old position he was returning to it disgraced,\r\nand the pain from which he had been saved in the first instance by\r\nsurroundings so new that he had hardly recognised his own identity in\r\nthe middle of them, came on him as from a wound inflicted yesterday.\r\n\r\nHe thought of the high resolves which he had made in prison about using\r\nhis disgrace as a vantage ground of strength rather than trying to make\r\npeople forget it. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was all very well then,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhen the grapes were beyond my reach, but now it is different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBesides, who but a prig would set himself high aims, or make high\r\nresolves at all?\r\n\r\nSome of his old friends, on learning that he had got rid of his\r\nsupposed wife and was now comfortably off again, wanted to renew their\r\nacquaintance; he was grateful to them and sometimes tried to meet their\r\nadvances half way, but it did not do, and ere long he shrank back into\r\nhimself, pretending not to know them. An infernal demon of honesty\r\nhaunted him which made him say to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cThese men know a great\r\ndeal, but do not know all\xe2\x80\x94if they did they would cut me\xe2\x80\x94and therefore I\r\nhave no right to their acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thought that everyone except himself was _sans peur et sans\r\nreproche_. Of course they must be, for if they had not been, would they\r\nnot have been bound to warn all who had anything to do with them of\r\ntheir deficiencies? Well, he could not do this, and he would not have\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance under false pretences, so he gave up even\r\nhankering after rehabilitation and fell back upon his old tastes for\r\nmusic and literature.\r\n\r\nOf course he has long since found out how silly all this was, how silly\r\nI mean in theory, for in practice it worked better than it ought to\r\nhave done, by keeping him free from _liaisons_ which would have tied\r\nhis tongue and made him see success elsewhere than where he came in\r\ntime to see it. He did what he did instinctively and for no other\r\nreason than because it was most natural to him. So far as he thought at\r\nall, he thought wrong, but what he did was right. I said something of\r\nthis kind to him once not so very long ago, and told him he had always\r\naimed high. \xe2\x80\x9cI never aimed at all,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied a little indignantly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand you may be sure I should have aimed low enough if I had thought I\r\nhad got the chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI suppose after all that no one whose mind was not, to put it mildly,\r\nabnormal, ever yet aimed very high out of pure malice aforethought. I\r\nonce saw a fly alight on a cup of hot coffee on which the milk had\r\nformed a thin skin; he perceived his extreme danger, and I noted with\r\nwhat ample strides and almost supermuscan effort he struck across the\r\ntreacherous surface and made for the edge of the cup\xe2\x80\x94for the ground was\r\nnot solid enough to let him raise himself from it by his wings. As I\r\nwatched him I fancied that so supreme a moment of difficulty and danger\r\nmight leave him with an increase of moral and physical power which\r\nmight even descend in some measure to his offspring. But surely he\r\nwould not have got the increased moral power if he could have helped\r\nit, and he will not knowingly alight upon another cup of hot coffee.\r\nThe more I see the more sure I am that it does not matter why people do\r\nthe right thing so long only as they do it, nor why they may have done\r\nthe wrong if they have done it. The result depends upon the thing done\r\nand the motive goes for nothing. I have read somewhere, but cannot\r\nremember where, that in some country district there was once a great\r\nscarcity of food, during which the poor suffered acutely; many indeed\r\nactually died of starvation, and all were hard put to it. In one\r\nvillage, however, there was a poor widow with a family of young\r\nchildren, who, though she had small visible means of subsistence, still\r\nlooked well-fed and comfortable, as also did all her little ones.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow,\xe2\x80\x9d everyone asked, \xe2\x80\x9cdid they manage to live?\xe2\x80\x9d It was plain they had\r\na secret, and it was equally plain that it could be no good one; for\r\nthere came a hurried, hunted look over the poor woman\xe2\x80\x99s face if anyone\r\nalluded to the way in which she and hers throve when others starved;\r\nthe family, moreover, were sometimes seen out at unusual hours of the\r\nnight, and evidently brought things home, which could hardly have been\r\nhonestly come by. They knew they were under suspicion, and, being\r\nhitherto of excellent name, it made them very unhappy, for it must be\r\nconfessed that they believed what they did to be uncanny if not\r\nabsolutely wicked; nevertheless, in spite of this they throve, and kept\r\ntheir strength when all their neighbours were pinched.\r\n\r\nAt length matters came to a head and the clergyman of the parish\r\ncross-questioned the poor woman so closely that with many tears and a\r\nbitter sense of degradation she confessed the truth; she and her\r\nchildren went into the hedges and gathered snails, which they made into\r\nbroth and ate\xe2\x80\x94could she ever be forgiven? Was there any hope of\r\nsalvation for her either in this world or the next after such unnatural\r\nconduct?\r\n\r\nSo again I have heard of an old dowager countess whose money was all in\r\nConsols; she had had many sons, and in her anxiety to give the younger\r\nones a good start, wanted a larger income than Consols would give her.\r\nShe consulted her solicitor and was advised to sell her Consols and\r\ninvest in the London and North-Western Railway, then at about 85. This\r\nwas to her what eating snails was to the poor widow whose story I have\r\ntold above. With shame and grief, as of one doing an unclean thing\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nher boys must have their start\xe2\x80\x94she did as she was advised. Then for a\r\nlong while she could not sleep at night and was haunted by a presage of\r\ndisaster. Yet what happened? She started her boys, and in a few years\r\nfound her capital doubled into the bargain, on which she sold out and\r\nwent back again to Consols and died in the full blessedness of\r\nfund-holding.\r\n\r\nShe thought, indeed, that she was doing a wrong and dangerous thing,\r\nbut this had absolutely nothing to do with it. Suppose she had invested\r\nin the full confidence of a recommendation by some eminent London\r\nbanker whose advice was bad, and so had lost all her money, and suppose\r\nshe had done this with a light heart and with no conviction of\r\nsin\xe2\x80\x94would her innocence of evil purpose and the excellence of her\r\nmotive have stood her in any stead? Not they.\r\n\r\nBut to return to my story. Towneley gave my hero most trouble.\r\nTowneley, as I have said, knew that Ernest would have money soon, but\r\nErnest did not of course know that he knew it. Towneley was rich\r\nhimself, and was married now; Ernest would be rich soon, had _bona\r\nfide_ intended to be married already, and would doubtless marry a\r\nlawful wife later on. Such a man was worth taking pains with, and when\r\nTowneley one day met Ernest in the street, and Ernest tried to avoid\r\nhim, Towneley would not have it, but with his usual quick good nature\r\nread his thoughts, caught him, morally speaking, by the scruff of his\r\nneck, and turned him laughingly inside out, telling him he would have\r\nno such nonsense.\r\n\r\nTowneley was just as much Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s idol now as he had ever been, and\r\nErnest, who was very easily touched, felt more gratefully and warmly\r\nthan ever towards him, but there was an unconscious something which was\r\nstronger than Towneley, and made my hero determine to break with him\r\nmore determinedly perhaps than with any other living person; he thanked\r\nhim in a low hurried voice and pressed his hand, while tears came into\r\nhis eyes in spite of all his efforts to repress them. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we meet\r\nagain,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not look at me, but if hereafter you hear of me\r\nwriting things you do not like, think of me as charitably as you can,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand so they parted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTowneley is a good fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cand you should not have\r\ncut him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTowneley,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cis not only a good fellow, but he is without\r\nexception the very best man I ever saw in my life\xe2\x80\x94except,\xe2\x80\x9d he paid me\r\nthe compliment of saying, \xe2\x80\x9cyourself; Towneley is my notion of\r\neverything which I should most like to be\xe2\x80\x94but there is no real\r\nsolidarity between us. I should be in perpetual fear of losing his good\r\nopinion if I said things he did not like, and I mean to say a great\r\nmany things,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued more merrily, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich Towneley will not\r\nlike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA man, as I have said already, can give up father and mother for\r\nChrist\xe2\x80\x99s sake tolerably easily for the most part, but it is not so easy\r\nto give up people like Towneley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nSo he fell away from all old friends except myself and three or four\r\nold intimates of my own, who were as sure to take to him as he to them,\r\nand who like myself enjoyed getting hold of a young fresh mind. Ernest\r\nattended to the keeping of my account books whenever there was anything\r\nwhich could possibly be attended to, which there seldom was, and spent\r\nthe greater part of the rest of his time in adding to the many notes\r\nand tentative essays which had already accumulated in his portfolios.\r\nAnyone who was used to writing could see at a glance that literature\r\nwas his natural development, and I was pleased at seeing him settle\r\ndown to it so spontaneously. I was less pleased, however, to observe\r\nthat he would still occupy himself with none but the most serious, I\r\nhad almost said solemn, subjects, just as he never cared about any but\r\nthe most serious kind of music.\r\n\r\nI said to him one day that the very slender reward which God had\r\nattached to the pursuit of serious inquiry was a sufficient proof that\r\nHe disapproved of it, or at any rate that He did not set much store by\r\nit nor wish to encourage it.\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about rewards. Look at Milton, who only got \xc2\xa35\r\nfor \xe2\x80\x98Paradise Lost.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a great deal too much,\xe2\x80\x9d I rejoined promptly. \xe2\x80\x9cI would have given\r\nhim twice as much myself not to have written it at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest was a little shocked. \xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d he said laughingly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t write poetry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a cut at me, for my burlesques were, of course, written in\r\nrhyme. So I dropped the matter.\r\n\r\nAfter a time he took it into his head to reopen the question of his\r\ngetting \xc2\xa3300 a year for doing, as he said, absolutely nothing, and said\r\nhe would try to find some employment which should bring him in enough\r\nto live upon.\r\n\r\nI laughed at this but let him alone. He tried and tried very hard for a\r\nlong while, but I need hardly say was unsuccessful. The older I grow,\r\nthe more convinced I become of the folly and credulity of the public;\r\nbut at the same time the harder do I see it is to impose oneself upon\r\nthat folly and credulity.\r\n\r\nHe tried editor after editor with article after article. Sometimes an\r\neditor listened to him and told him to leave his articles; he almost\r\ninvariably, however, had them returned to him in the end with a polite\r\nnote saying that they were not suited for the particular paper to which\r\nhe had sent them. And yet many of these very articles appeared in his\r\nlater works, and no one complained of them, not at least on the score\r\nof bad literary workmanship. \xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to me one day, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\ndemand is very imperious, and supply must be very suppliant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce, indeed, the editor of an important monthly magazine accepted an\r\narticle from him, and he thought he had now got a footing in the\r\nliterary world. The article was to appear in the next issue but one,\r\nand he was to receive proof from the printers in about ten days or a\r\nfortnight; but week after week passed and there was no proof; month\r\nafter month went by and there was still no room for Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s article;\r\nat length after about six months the editor one morning told him that\r\nhe had filled every number of his review for the next ten months, but\r\nthat his article should definitely appear. On this he insisted on\r\nhaving his MS. returned to him.\r\n\r\nSometimes his articles were actually published, and he found the editor\r\nhad edited them according to his own fancy, putting in jokes which he\r\nthought were funny, or cutting out the very passage which Ernest had\r\nconsidered the point of the whole thing, and then, though the articles\r\nappeared, when it came to paying for them it was another matter, and he\r\nnever saw his money. \xe2\x80\x9cEditors,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to me one day about this time,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9care like the people who bought and sold in the book of Revelation;\r\nthere is not one but has the mark of the beast upon him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last after months of disappointment and many a tedious hour wasted\r\nin dingy anterooms (and of all anterooms those of editors appear to me\r\nto be the dreariest), he got a _bona fide_ offer of employment from one\r\nof the first class weekly papers through an introduction I was able to\r\nget for him from one who had powerful influence with the paper in\r\nquestion. The editor sent him a dozen long books upon varied and\r\ndifficult subjects, and told him to review them in a single article\r\nwithin a week. In one book there was an editorial note to the effect\r\nthat the writer was to be condemned. Ernest particularly admired the\r\nbook he was desired to condemn, and feeling how hopeless it was for him\r\nto do anything like justice to the books submitted to him, returned\r\nthem to the editor.\r\n\r\nAt last one paper did actually take a dozen or so of articles from him,\r\nand gave him cash down a couple of guineas apiece for them, but having\r\ndone this it expired within a fortnight after the last of Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narticles had appeared. It certainly looked very much as if the other\r\neditors knew their business in declining to have anything to do with my\r\nunlucky godson.\r\n\r\nI was not sorry that he failed with periodical literature, for writing\r\nfor reviews or newspapers is bad training for one who may aspire to\r\nwrite works of more permanent interest. A young writer should have more\r\ntime for reflection than he can get as a contributor to the daily or\r\neven weekly press. Ernest himself, however, was chagrined at finding\r\nhow unmarketable he was. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to me, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I was a well-bred\r\nhorse, or sheep, or a pure-bred pigeon or lop-eared rabbit I should be\r\nmore saleable. If I was even a cathedral in a colonial town people\r\nwould give me something, but as it is they do not want me\xe2\x80\x9d; and now\r\nthat he was well and rested he wanted to set up a shop again, but this,\r\nof course, I would not hear of.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat care I,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to me one day, \xe2\x80\x9cabout being what they call a\r\ngentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d And his manner was almost fierce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has being a gentleman ever done for me except make me less able\r\nto prey and more easy to be preyed upon? It has changed the manner of\r\nmy being swindled, that is all. But for your kindness to me I should be\r\npenniless. Thank heaven I have placed my children where I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI begged him to keep quiet a little longer and not talk about taking a\r\nshop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill being a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbring me money at the last, and\r\nwill anything bring me as much peace at the last as money will? They\r\nsay that those who have riches enter hardly into the kingdom of Heaven.\r\nBy Jove, they do; they are like Struldbrugs; they live and live and\r\nlive and are happy for many a long year after they would have entered\r\ninto the kingdom of Heaven if they had been poor. I want to live long\r\nand to raise my children, if I see they would be happier for the\r\nraising; that is what I want, and it is not what I am doing now that\r\nwill help me. Being a gentleman is a luxury which I cannot afford,\r\ntherefore I do not want it. Let me go back to my shop again, and do\r\nthings for people which they want done and will pay me for doing for\r\nthem. They know what they want and what is good for them better than I\r\ncan tell them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was hard to deny the soundness of this, and if he had been dependent\r\nonly on the \xc2\xa3300 a year which he was getting from me I should have\r\nadvised him to open his shop again next morning. As it was, I\r\ntemporised and raised obstacles, and quieted him from time to time as\r\nbest I could.\r\n\r\nOf course he read Mr Darwin\xe2\x80\x99s books as fast as they came out and\r\nadopted evolution as an article of faith. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nonce, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am like one of those caterpillars which, if they have\r\nbeen interrupted in making their hammock, must begin again from the\r\nbeginning. So long as I went back a long way down in the social scale I\r\ngot on all right, and should have made money but for Ellen; when I try\r\nto take up the work at a higher stage I fail completely.\xe2\x80\x9d I do not know\r\nwhether the analogy holds good or not, but I am sure Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s instinct\r\nwas right in telling him that after a heavy fall he had better begin\r\nlife again at a very low stage, and as I have just said, I would have\r\nlet him go back to his shop if I had not known what I did.\r\n\r\nAs the time fixed upon by his aunt drew nearer I prepared him more and\r\nmore for what was coming, and at last, on his twenty-eighth birthday, I\r\nwas able to tell him all and to show him the letter signed by his aunt\r\nupon her death-bed to the effect that I was to hold the money in trust\r\nfor him. His birthday happened that year (1863) to be on a Sunday, but\r\non the following day I transferred his shares into his own name, and\r\npresented him with the account books which he had been keeping for the\r\nlast year and a half.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all that I had done to prepare him, it was a long while\r\nbefore I could get him actually to believe that the money was his own.\r\nHe did not say much\xe2\x80\x94no more did I, for I am not sure that I did not\r\nfeel as much moved at having brought my long trusteeship to a\r\nsatisfactory conclusion as Ernest did at finding himself owner of more\r\nthan \xc2\xa370,000. When he did speak it was to jerk out a sentence or two of\r\nreflection at a time. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I were rendering this moment in music,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI should allow myself free use of the augmented sixth.\xe2\x80\x9d A little\r\nlater I remember his saying with a laugh that had something of a family\r\nlikeness to his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not the pleasure it causes me which I\r\nenjoy so, it is the pain it will cause to all my friends except\r\nyourself and Towneley.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot tell your father and mother\xe2\x80\x94it would drive them\r\nmad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cit would be too cruel; it would be like Isaac\r\noffering up Abraham and no thicket with a ram in it near at hand.\r\nBesides why should I? We have cut each other these four years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt almost seemed as though our casual mention of Theobald and Christina\r\nhad in some way excited them from a dormant to an active state. During\r\nthe years that had elapsed since they last appeared upon the scene they\r\nhad remained at Battersby, and had concentrated their affection upon\r\ntheir other children.\r\n\r\nIt had been a bitter pill to Theobald to lose his power of plaguing his\r\nfirst-born; if the truth were known I believe he had felt this more\r\nacutely than any disgrace which might have been shed upon him by\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x99s imprisonment. He had made one or two attempts to reopen\r\nnegotiations through me, but I never said anything about them to\r\nErnest, for I knew it would upset him. I wrote, however, to Theobald\r\nthat I had found his son inexorable, and recommended him for the\r\npresent, at any rate, to desist from returning to the subject. This I\r\nthought would be at once what Ernest would like best and Theobald\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nA few days, however, after Ernest had come into his property, I\r\nreceived a letter from Theobald enclosing one for Ernest which I could\r\nnot withhold.\r\n\r\nThe letter ran thus:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo my son Ernest,\xe2\x80\x94Although you have more than once rejected my\r\novertures I appeal yet again to your better nature. Your mother, who\r\nhas long been ailing, is, I believe, near her end; she is unable to\r\nkeep anything on her stomach, and Dr Martin holds out but little hopes\r\nof her recovery. She has expressed a wish to see you, and says she\r\nknows you will not refuse to come to her, which, considering her\r\ncondition, I am unwilling to suppose you will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remit you a Post Office order for your fare, and will pay your\r\nreturn journey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you want clothes to come in, order what you consider suitable, and\r\ndesire that the bill be sent to me; I will pay it immediately, to an\r\namount not exceeding eight or nine pounds, and if you will let me know\r\nwhat train you will come by, I will send the carriage to meet you.\r\nBelieve me, Your affectionate father,\r\n\r\n\r\nT. PONTIFEX.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course there could be no hesitation on Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s part. He could\r\nafford to smile now at his father\xe2\x80\x99s offering to pay for his clothes,\r\nand his sending him a Post Office order for the exact price of a\r\nsecond-class ticket, and he was of course shocked at learning the state\r\nhis mother was said to be in, and touched at her desire to see him. He\r\ntelegraphed that he would come down at once. I saw him a little before\r\nhe started, and was pleased to see how well his tailor had done by him.\r\nTowneley himself could not have been appointed more becomingly. His\r\nportmanteau, his railway wrapper, everything he had about him, was in\r\nkeeping. I thought he had grown much better-looking than he had been at\r\ntwo or three and twenty. His year and a half of peace had effaced all\r\nthe ill effects of his previous suffering, and now that he had become\r\nactually rich there was an air of _insouciance_ and good humour upon\r\nhis face, as of a man with whom everything was going perfectly right,\r\nwhich would have made a much plainer man good-looking. I was proud of\r\nhim and delighted with him. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nwhatever else he may do, he will never marry again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe journey was a painful one. As he drew near to the station and\r\ncaught sight of each familiar feature, so strong was the force of\r\nassociation that he felt as though his coming into his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s money had\r\nbeen a dream, and he were again returning to his father\xe2\x80\x99s house as he\r\nhad returned to it from Cambridge for the vacations. Do what he would,\r\nthe old dull weight of _home-sickness_ began to oppress him, his heart\r\nbeat fast as he thought of his approaching meeting with his father and\r\nmother, \xe2\x80\x9cand I shall have,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cto kiss Charlotte.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWould his father meet him at the station? Would he greet him as though\r\nnothing had happened, or would he be cold and distant? How, again,\r\nwould he take the news of his son\xe2\x80\x99s good fortune? As the train drew up\r\nto the platform, Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s eye ran hurriedly over the few people who\r\nwere in the station. His father\xe2\x80\x99s well-known form was not among them,\r\nbut on the other side of the palings which divided the station yard\r\nfrom the platform, he saw the pony carriage, looking, as he thought,\r\nrather shabby, and recognised his father\xe2\x80\x99s coachman. In a few minutes\r\nmore he was in the carriage driving towards Battersby. He could not\r\nhelp smiling as he saw the coachman give a look of surprise at finding\r\nhim so much changed in personal appearance. The coachman was the more\r\nsurprised because when Ernest had last been at home he had been dressed\r\nas a clergyman, and now he was not only a layman, but a layman who was\r\ngot up regardless of expense. The change was so great that it was not\r\ntill Ernest actually spoke to him that the coachman knew him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are my father and mother?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked hurriedly, as he got into the\r\ncarriage. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Master\xe2\x80\x99s well, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the Missis is\r\nvery sadly.\xe2\x80\x9d The horse knew that he was going home and pulled hard at\r\nthe reins. The weather was cold and raw\xe2\x80\x94the very ideal of a November\r\nday; in one part of the road the floods were out, and near here they\r\nhad to pass through a number of horsemen and dogs, for the hounds had\r\nmet that morning at a place near Battersby. Ernest saw several people\r\nwhom he knew, but they either, as is most likely, did not recognise\r\nhim, or did not know of his good luck. When Battersby church tower drew\r\nnear, and he saw the Rectory on the top of the hill, its chimneys just\r\nshowing above the leafless trees with which it was surrounded, he threw\r\nhimself back in the carriage and covered his face with his hands.\r\n\r\nIt came to an end, as even the worst quarters of an hour do, and in a\r\nfew minutes more he was on the steps in front of his father\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\nHis father, hearing the carriage arrive, came a little way down the\r\nsteps to meet him. Like the coachman he saw at a glance that Ernest was\r\nappointed as though money were abundant with him, and that he was\r\nlooking robust and full of health and vigour.\r\n\r\nThis was not what he had bargained for. He wanted Ernest to return, but\r\nhe was to return as any respectable, well-regulated prodigal ought to\r\nreturn\xe2\x80\x94abject, broken-hearted, asking forgiveness from the tenderest\r\nand most long-suffering father in the whole world. If he should have\r\nshoes and stockings and whole clothes at all, it should be only because\r\nabsolute rags and tatters had been graciously dispensed with, whereas\r\nhere he was swaggering in a grey ulster and a blue and white necktie,\r\nand looking better than Theobald had ever seen him in his life. It was\r\nunprincipled. Was it for this that he had been generous enough to offer\r\nto provide Ernest with decent clothes in which to come and visit his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s death-bed? Could any advantage be meaner than the one which\r\nErnest had taken? Well, he would not go a penny beyond the eight or\r\nnine pounds which he had promised. It was fortunate he had given a\r\nlimit. Why he, Theobald, had never been able to afford such a\r\nportmanteau in his life. He was still using an old one which his father\r\nhad turned over to him when he went up to Cambridge. Besides, he had\r\nsaid clothes, not a portmanteau.\r\n\r\nErnest saw what was passing through his father\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and felt that he\r\nought to have prepared him in some way for what he now saw; but he had\r\nsent his telegram so immediately on receiving his father\xe2\x80\x99s letter, and\r\nhad followed it so promptly that it would not have been easy to do so\r\neven if he had thought of it. He put out his hand and said laughingly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s all paid for\xe2\x80\x94I am afraid you do not know that Mr Overton has\r\nhanded over to me Aunt Alethea\xe2\x80\x99s money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheobald flushed scarlet. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and these were the first\r\nwords that actually crossed his lips\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cif the money was not his to keep,\r\ndid he not hand it over to my brother John and me?\xe2\x80\x9d He stammered a good\r\ndeal and looked sheepish, but he got the words out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, my dear father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ernest still laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cmy aunt left it\r\nto him in trust for me, not in trust either for you or for my Uncle\r\nJohn\xe2\x80\x94and it has accumulated till it is now over \xc2\xa370,000. But tell me\r\nhow is my mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Ernest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Theobald excitedly, \xe2\x80\x9cthe matter cannot rest here, I\r\nmust know that this is all open and above board.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis had the true Theobald ring and instantly brought the whole train\r\nof ideas which in Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s mind were connected with his father. The\r\nsurroundings were the old familiar ones, but the surrounded were\r\nchanged almost beyond power of recognition. He turned sharply on\r\nTheobald in a moment. I will not repeat the words he used, for they\r\ncame out before he had time to consider them, and they might strike\r\nsome of my readers as disrespectful; there were not many of them, but\r\nthey were effectual. Theobald said nothing, but turned almost of an\r\nashen colour; he never again spoke to his son in such a way as to make\r\nit necessary for him to repeat what he had said on this occasion.\r\nErnest quickly recovered his temper and again asked after his mother.\r\nTheobald was glad enough to take this opening now, and replied at once\r\nin the tone he would have assumed towards one he most particularly\r\ndesired to conciliate, that she was getting rapidly worse in spite of\r\nall he had been able to do for her, and concluded by saying she had\r\nbeen the comfort and mainstay of his life for more than thirty years,\r\nbut that he could not wish it prolonged.\r\n\r\nThe pair then went upstairs to Christina\xe2\x80\x99s room, the one in which\r\nErnest had been born. His father went before him and prepared her for\r\nher son\xe2\x80\x99s approach. The poor woman raised herself in bed as he came\r\ntowards her, and weeping as she flung her arms around him, cried: \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nI knew he would come, I knew, I knew he could come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest broke down and wept as he had not done for years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my boy, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said as soon as she could recover her voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you never really been near us for all these years? Ah, you do not\r\nknow how we have loved you and mourned over you, papa just as much as I\r\nhave. You know he shows his feelings less, but I can never tell you how\r\nvery, very deeply he has felt for you. Sometimes at night I have\r\nthought I have heard footsteps in the garden, and have got quietly out\r\nof bed lest I should wake him, and gone to the window to look out, but\r\nthere has been only dark or the greyness of the morning, and I have\r\ngone crying back to bed again. Still I think you have been near us\r\nthough you were too proud to let us know\xe2\x80\x94and now at last I have you in\r\nmy arms once more, my dearest, dearest boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow cruel, how infamously unfeeling Ernest thought he had been.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cforgive me\xe2\x80\x94the fault was mine, I ought not to have\r\nbeen so hard; I was wrong, very wrong\xe2\x80\x9d; the poor blubbering fellow\r\nmeant what he said, and his heart yearned to his mother as he had never\r\nthought that it could yearn again. \xe2\x80\x9cBut have you never,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccome although it was in the dark and we did not know it\xe2\x80\x94oh, let me\r\nthink that you have not been so cruel as we have thought you. Tell me\r\nthat you came if only to comfort me and make me happier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest was ready. \xe2\x80\x9cI had no money to come with, mother, till just\r\nlately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was an excuse Christina could understand and make allowance for;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, then you would have come, and I will take the will for the\r\ndeed\xe2\x80\x94and now that I have you safe again, say that you will never, never\r\nleave me\xe2\x80\x94not till\xe2\x80\x94not till\xe2\x80\x94oh, my boy, have they told you I am dying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe wept bitterly, and buried her head in her pillow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nJoey and Charlotte were in the room. Joey was now ordained, and was\r\ncurate to Theobald. He and Ernest had never been sympathetic, and\r\nErnest saw at a glance that there was no chance of a _rapprochement_\r\nbetween them. He was a little startled at seeing Joey dressed as a\r\nclergyman, and looking so like what he had looked himself a few years\r\nearlier, for there was a good deal of family likeness between the pair;\r\nbut Joey\xe2\x80\x99s face was cold and was illumined with no spark of\r\nBohemianism; he was a clergyman and was going to do as other clergymen\r\ndid, neither better nor worse. He greeted Ernest rather _de haut en\r\nbas_, that is to say he began by trying to do so, but the affair tailed\r\noff unsatisfactorily.\r\n\r\nHis sister presented her cheek to him to be kissed. How he hated it; he\r\nhad been dreading it for the last three hours. She, too, was distant\r\nand reproachful in her manner, as such a superior person was sure to\r\nbe. She had a grievance against him inasmuch as she was still\r\nunmarried. She laid the blame of this at Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s door; it was his\r\nmisconduct she maintained in secret, which had prevented young men from\r\nmaking offers to her, and she ran him up a heavy bill for consequential\r\ndamages. She and Joey had from the first developed an instinct for\r\nhunting with the hounds, and now these two had fairly identified\r\nthemselves with the older generation\xe2\x80\x94that is to say as against Ernest.\r\nOn this head there was an offensive and defensive alliance between\r\nthem, but between themselves there was subdued but internecine warfare.\r\n\r\nThis at least was what Ernest gathered, partly from his recollections\r\nof the parties concerned, and partly from his observation of their\r\nlittle ways during the first half-hour after his arrival, while they\r\nwere all together in his mother\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom\xe2\x80\x94for as yet of course they did\r\nnot know that he had money. He could see that they eyed him from time\r\nto time with a surprise not unmixed with indignation, and knew very\r\nwell what they were thinking.\r\n\r\nChristina saw the change which had come over him\xe2\x80\x94how much firmer and\r\nmore vigorous both in mind and body he seemed than when she had last\r\nseen him. She saw too how well he was dressed, and, like the others, in\r\nspite of the return of all her affection for her first-born, was a\r\nlittle alarmed about Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s pocket, which she supposed would have\r\nto be mulcted for all this magnificence. Perceiving this, Ernest\r\nrelieved her mind and told her all about his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s bequest, and how I\r\nhad husbanded it, in the presence of his brother and sister\xe2\x80\x94who,\r\nhowever, pretended not to notice, or at any rate to notice as a matter\r\nin which they could hardly be expected to take an interest.\r\n\r\nHis mother kicked a little at first against the money\xe2\x80\x99s having gone to\r\nhim as she said \xe2\x80\x9cover his papa\xe2\x80\x99s head.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a\r\ndeprecating tone, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is more than ever your papa has had\xe2\x80\x9d; but\r\nErnest calmed her by suggesting that if Miss Pontifex had known how\r\nlarge the sum would become she would have left the greater part of it\r\nto Theobald. This compromise was accepted by Christina who forthwith,\r\nill as she was, entered with ardour into the new position, and taking\r\nit as a fresh point of departure, began spending Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s money for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI may say in passing that Christina was right in saying that Theobald\r\nhad never had so much money as his son was now possessed of. In the\r\nfirst place he had not had a fourteen years\xe2\x80\x99 minority with no outgoings\r\nto prevent the accumulation of the money, and in the second he, like\r\nmyself and almost everyone else, had suffered somewhat in the 1846\r\ntimes\xe2\x80\x94not enough to cripple him or even seriously to hurt him, but\r\nenough to give him a scare and make him stick to debentures for the\r\nrest of his life. It was the fact of his son\xe2\x80\x99s being the richer man of\r\nthe two, and of his being rich so young, which rankled with Theobald\r\neven more than the fact of his having money at all. If he had had to\r\nwait till he was sixty or sixty-five, and become broken down from long\r\nfailure in the meantime, why then perhaps he might have been allowed to\r\nhave whatever sum should suffice to keep him out of the workhouse and\r\npay his death-bed expenses; but that he should come in to \xc2\xa370,000 at\r\neight and twenty, and have no wife and only two children\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nintolerable. Christina was too ill and in too great a hurry to spend\r\nthe money to care much about such details as the foregoing, and she was\r\nnaturally much more good-natured than Theobald.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis piece of good fortune\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she saw it at a glance\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cquite wiped out\r\nthe disgrace of his having been imprisoned. There should be no more\r\nnonsense about that. The whole thing was a mistake, an unfortunate\r\nmistake, true, but the less said about it now the better. Of course\r\nErnest would come back and live at Battersby until he was married, and\r\nhe would pay his father handsomely for board and lodging. In fact it\r\nwould be only right that Theobald should make a profit, nor would\r\nErnest himself wish it to be other than a handsome one; this was far\r\nthe best and simplest arrangement; and he could take his sister out\r\nmore than Theobald or Joey cared to do, and would also doubtless\r\nentertain very handsomely at Battersby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course he would buy Joey a living, and make large presents yearly\r\nto his sister\xe2\x80\x94was there anything else? Oh! yes\xe2\x80\x94he would become a county\r\nmagnate now; a man with nearly \xc2\xa34000 a year should certainly become a\r\ncounty magnate. He might even go into Parliament. He had very fair\r\nabilities, nothing indeed approaching such genius as Dr Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s, nor\r\neven as Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s, still he was not deficient and if he got into\r\nParliament\xe2\x80\x94so young too\xe2\x80\x94there was nothing to hinder his being Prime\r\nMinister before he died, and if so, of course, he would become a peer.\r\nOh! why did he not set about it all at once, so that she might live to\r\nhear people call her son \xe2\x80\x98my lord\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Lord Battersby she thought would do\r\nvery nicely, and if she was well enough to sit he must certainly have\r\nher portrait painted at full length for one end of his large\r\ndining-hall. It should be exhibited at the Royal Academy: \xe2\x80\x98Portrait of\r\nLord Battersby\xe2\x80\x99s mother,\xe2\x80\x99 she said to herself, and her heart fluttered\r\nwith all its wonted vivacity. If she could not sit, happily, she had\r\nbeen photographed not so very long ago, and the portrait had been as\r\nsuccessful as any photograph could be of a face which depended so\r\nentirely upon its expression as her own. Perhaps the painter could take\r\nthe portrait sufficiently from this. It was better after all that\r\nErnest had given up the Church\xe2\x80\x94how far more wisely God arranges matters\r\nfor us than ever we can do for ourselves! She saw it all now\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nJoey who would become Archbishop of Canterbury and Ernest would remain\r\na layman and become Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x9d . . . and so on till her daughter\r\ntold her it was time to take her medicine.\r\n\r\nI suppose this reverie, which is a mere fragment of what actually ran\r\nthrough Christina\xe2\x80\x99s brain, occupied about a minute and a half, but it,\r\nor the presence of her son, seemed to revive her spirits wonderfully.\r\nIll, dying indeed, and suffering as she was, she brightened up so as to\r\nlaugh once or twice quite merrily during the course of the afternoon.\r\nNext day Dr Martin said she was so much better that he almost began to\r\nhave hopes of her recovery again. Theobald, whenever this was touched\r\nupon as possible, would shake his head and say: \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t wish it\r\nprolonged,\xe2\x80\x9d and then Charlotte caught Ernest unawares and said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nknow, dear Ernest, that these ups and downs of talk are terribly\r\nagitating to papa; he could stand whatever comes, but it is quite too\r\nwearing to him to think half-a-dozen different things backwards and\r\nforwards, up and down in the same twenty-four hours, and it would be\r\nkinder of you not to do it\xe2\x80\x94I mean not to say anything to him even\r\nthough Dr Martin does hold out hopes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharlotte had meant to imply that it was Ernest who was at the bottom\r\nof all the inconvenience felt by Theobald, herself, Joey and everyone\r\nelse, and she had actually got words out which should convey this;\r\ntrue, she had not dared to stick to them and had turned them off, but\r\nshe had made them hers at any rate for one brief moment, and this was\r\nbetter than nothing. Ernest noticed throughout his mother\xe2\x80\x99s illness,\r\nthat Charlotte found immediate occasion to make herself disagreeable to\r\nhim whenever either doctor or nurse pronounced her mother to be a\r\nlittle better. When she wrote to Crampsford to desire the prayers of\r\nthe congregation (she was sure her mother would wish it, and that the\r\nCrampsford people would be pleased at her remembrance of them), she was\r\nsending another letter on some quite different subject at the same\r\ntime, and put the two letters into the wrong envelopes. Ernest was\r\nasked to take these letters to the village post-office, and imprudently\r\ndid so; when the error came to be discovered Christina happened to have\r\nrallied a little. Charlotte flew at Ernest immediately, and laid all\r\nthe blame of the blunder upon his shoulders.\r\n\r\nExcept that Joey and Charlotte were more fully developed, the house and\r\nits inmates, organic and inorganic, were little changed since Ernest\r\nhad last seen them. The furniture and the ornaments on the\r\nchimney-piece were just as they had been ever since he could remember\r\nanything at all. In the drawing-room, on either side of the fireplace\r\nthere hung the Carlo Dolci and the Sassoferrato as in old times; there\r\nwas the water colour of a scene on the Lago Maggiore, copied by\r\nCharlotte from an original lent her by her drawing master, and finished\r\nunder his direction. This was the picture of which one of the servants\r\nhad said that it must be good, for Mr Pontifex had given ten shillings\r\nfor the frame. The paper on the walls was unchanged; the roses were\r\nstill waiting for the bees; and the whole family still prayed night and\r\nmorning to be made \xe2\x80\x9ctruly honest and conscientious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne picture only was removed\xe2\x80\x94a photograph of himself which had hung\r\nunder one of his father and between those of his brother and sister.\r\nErnest noticed this at prayer time, while his father was reading about\r\nNoah\xe2\x80\x99s ark and how they daubed it with slime, which, as it happened,\r\nhad been Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s favourite text when he was a boy. Next morning,\r\nhowever, the photograph had found its way back again, a little dusty\r\nand with a bit of the gilding chipped off from one corner of the frame,\r\nbut there sure enough it was. I suppose they put it back when they\r\nfound how rich he had become.\r\n\r\nIn the dining-room the ravens were still trying to feed Elijah over the\r\nfireplace; what a crowd of reminiscences did not this picture bring\r\nback! Looking out of the window, there were the flower beds in the\r\nfront garden exactly as they had been, and Ernest found himself looking\r\nhard against the blue door at the bottom of the garden to see if there\r\nwas rain falling, as he had been used to look when he was a child doing\r\nlessons with his father.\r\n\r\nAfter their early dinner, when Joey and Ernest and their father were\r\nleft alone, Theobald rose and stood in the middle of the hearthrug\r\nunder the Elijah picture, and began to whistle in his old absent way.\r\nHe had two tunes only, one was \xe2\x80\x9cIn my Cottage near a Wood,\xe2\x80\x9d and the\r\nother was the Easter Hymn; he had been trying to whistle them all his\r\nlife, but had never succeeded; he whistled them as a clever bullfinch\r\nmight whistle them\xe2\x80\x94he had got them, but he had not got them right; he\r\nwould be a semitone out in every third note as though reverting to some\r\nremote musical progenitor, who had known none but the Lydian or the\r\nPhrygian mode, or whatever would enable him to go most wrong while\r\nstill keeping the tune near enough to be recognised. Theobald stood\r\nbefore the middle of the fire and whistled his two tunes softly in his\r\nown old way till Ernest left the room; the unchangedness of the\r\nexternal and changedness of the internal he felt were likely to throw\r\nhim completely off his balance.\r\n\r\nHe strolled out of doors into the sodden spinney behind the house, and\r\nsolaced himself with a pipe. Ere long he found himself at the door of\r\nthe cottage of his father\xe2\x80\x99s coachman, who had married an old lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmaid of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s, to whom Ernest had been always much attached as\r\nshe also to him, for she had known him ever since he had been five or\r\nsix years old. Her name was Susan. He sat down in the rocking-chair\r\nbefore her fire, and Susan went on ironing at the table in front of the\r\nwindow, and a smell of hot flannel pervaded the kitchen.\r\n\r\nSusan had been retained too securely by Christina to be likely to side\r\nwith Ernest all in a moment. He knew this very well, and did not call\r\non her for the sake of support, moral or otherwise. He had called\r\nbecause he liked her, and also because he knew that he should gather\r\nmuch in a chat with her that he should not be able to arrive at in any\r\nother way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Master Ernest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy did you not come back when your\r\npoor papa and mamma wanted you? I\xe2\x80\x99m sure your ma has said to me a\r\nhundred times over if she has said it once that all should be exactly\r\nas it had been before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest smiled to himself. It was no use explaining to Susan why he\r\nsmiled, so he said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the first day or two I thought she never would get over it; she\r\nsaid it was a judgement upon her, and went on about things as she had\r\nsaid and done many years ago, before your pa knew her, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat she didn\xe2\x80\x99t say or wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have said only I stopped her; she\r\nseemed out of her mind like, and said that none of the neighbours would\r\never speak to her again, but the next day Mrs Bushby (her that was Miss\r\nCowey, you know) called, and your ma always was so fond of her, and it\r\nseemed to do her a power o\xe2\x80\x99 good, for the next day she went through all\r\nher dresses, and we settled how she should have them altered; and then\r\nall the neighbours called for miles and miles round, and your ma came\r\nin here, and said she had been going through the waters of misery, and\r\nthe Lord had turned them to a well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Oh yes, Susan,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98be sure it is so. Whom the Lord loveth he\r\nchasteneth, Susan,\xe2\x80\x99 and here she began to cry again. \xe2\x80\x98As for him,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nwent on, \xe2\x80\x98he has made his bed, and he must lie on it; when he comes out\r\nof prison his pa will know what is best to be done, and Master Ernest\r\nmay be thankful that he has a pa so good and so long-suffering.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen when you would not see them, that was a cruel blow to your ma.\r\nYour pa did not say anything; you know your pa never does say very much\r\nunless he\xe2\x80\x99s downright waxy for the time; but your ma took on dreadful\r\nfor a few days, and I never saw the master look so black; but, bless\r\nyou, it all went off in a few days, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that there\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nmuch difference in either of them since then, not till your ma was took\r\nill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the night of his arrival he had behaved well at family prayers, as\r\nalso on the following morning; his father read about David\xe2\x80\x99s dying\r\ninjunctions to Solomon in the matter of Shimei, but he did not mind it.\r\nIn the course of the day, however, his corns had been trodden on so\r\nmany times that he was in a misbehaving humour, on this the second\r\nnight after his arrival. He knelt next Charlotte and said the responses\r\nperfunctorily, not so perfunctorily that she should know for certain\r\nthat he was doing it maliciously, but so perfunctorily as to make her\r\nuncertain whether he might be malicious or not, and when he had to pray\r\nto be made truly honest and conscientious he emphasised the \xe2\x80\x9ctruly.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\ndo not know whether Charlotte noticed anything, but she knelt at some\r\ndistance from him during the rest of his stay. He assures me that this\r\nwas the only spiteful thing he did during the whole time he was at\r\nBattersby.\r\n\r\nWhen he went up to his bedroom, in which, to do them justice, they had\r\ngiven him a fire, he noticed what indeed he had noticed as soon as he\r\nwas shown into it on his arrival, that there was an illuminated card\r\nframed and glazed over his bed with the words, \xe2\x80\x9cBe the day weary or be\r\nthe day long, at last it ringeth to evensong.\xe2\x80\x9d He wondered to himself\r\nhow such people could leave such a card in a room in which their\r\nvisitors would have to spend the last hours of their evening, but he\r\nlet it alone. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s not enough difference between \xe2\x80\x98weary\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98long\xe2\x80\x99\r\nto warrant an \xe2\x80\x98or,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I suppose it is all right.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nbelieve Christina had bought the card at a bazaar in aid of the\r\nrestoration of a neighbouring church, and having been bought it had got\r\nto be used\xe2\x80\x94besides, the sentiment was so touching and the illumination\r\nwas really lovely. Anyhow, no irony could be more complete than leaving\r\nit in my hero\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom, though assuredly no irony had been intended.\r\n\r\nOn the third day after Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s arrival Christina relapsed again. For\r\nthe last two days she had been in no pain and had slept a good deal;\r\nher son\xe2\x80\x99s presence still seemed to cheer her, and she often said how\r\nthankful she was to be surrounded on her death-bed by a family so\r\nhappy, so God-fearing, so united, but now she began to wander, and,\r\nbeing more sensible of the approach of death, seemed also more alarmed\r\nat the thoughts of the Day of Judgment.\r\n\r\nShe ventured more than once or twice to return to the subject of her\r\nsins, and implored Theobald to make quite sure that they were forgiven\r\nher. She hinted that she considered his professional reputation was at\r\nstake; it would never do for his own wife to fail in securing at any\r\nrate a pass. This was touching Theobald on a tender spot; he winced and\r\nrejoined with an impatient toss of the head, \xe2\x80\x9cBut, Christina, they\r\n_are_ forgiven you\xe2\x80\x9d; and then he entrenched himself in a firm but\r\ndignified manner behind the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s prayer. When he rose he left the\r\nroom, but called Ernest out to say that he could not wish it prolonged.\r\n\r\nJoey was no more use in quieting his mother\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety than Theobald had\r\nbeen\xe2\x80\x94indeed he was only Theobald and water; at last Ernest, who had not\r\nliked interfering, took the matter in hand, and, sitting beside her,\r\nlet her pour out her grief to him without let or hindrance.\r\n\r\nShe said she knew she had not given up all for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake; it was\r\nthis that weighed upon her. She had given up much, and had always tried\r\nto give up more year by year, still she knew very well that she had not\r\nbeen so spiritually minded as she ought to have been. If she had, she\r\nshould probably have been favoured with some direct vision or\r\ncommunication; whereas, though God had vouchsafed such direct and\r\nvisible angelic visits to one of her dear children, yet she had had\r\nnone such herself\xe2\x80\x94nor even had Theobald.\r\n\r\nShe was talking rather to herself than to Ernest as she said these\r\nwords, but they made him open his ears. He wanted to know whether the\r\nangel had appeared to Joey or to Charlotte. He asked his mother, but\r\nshe seemed surprised, as though she expected him to know all about it,\r\nthen, as if she remembered, she checked herself and said, \xe2\x80\x9cAh! yes\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nknow nothing of all this, and perhaps it is as well.\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest could not\r\nof course press the subject, so he never found out which of his near\r\nrelations it was who had had direct communication with an immortal. The\r\nothers never said anything to him about it, though whether this was\r\nbecause they were ashamed, or because they feared he would not believe\r\nthe story and thus increase his own damnation, he could not determine.\r\n\r\nErnest has often thought about this since. He tried to get the facts\r\nout of Susan, who he was sure would know, but Charlotte had been\r\nbeforehand with him. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Master Ernest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, when he began to\r\nquestion her, \xe2\x80\x9cyour ma has sent a message to me by Miss Charlotte as I\r\nam not to say nothing at all about it, and I never will.\xe2\x80\x9d Of course no\r\nfurther questioning was possible. It had more than once occurred to\r\nErnest that Charlotte did not in reality believe more than he did\r\nhimself, and this incident went far to strengthen his surmises, but he\r\nwavered when he remembered how she had misdirected the letter asking\r\nfor the prayers of the congregation. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself\r\ngloomily, \xe2\x80\x9cshe does believe in it after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Christina returned to the subject of her own want of\r\nspiritual-mindedness, she even harped upon the old grievance of her\r\nhaving eaten black puddings\xe2\x80\x94true, she had given them up years ago, but\r\nfor how many years had she not persevered in eating them after she had\r\nhad misgivings about their having been forbidden! Then there was\r\nsomething that weighed on her mind that had taken place before her\r\nmarriage, and she should like\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nErnest interrupted: \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are ill and your\r\nmind is unstrung; others can now judge better about you than you can; I\r\nassure you that to me you seem to have been the most devotedly\r\nunselfish wife and mother that ever lived. Even if you have not\r\nliterally given up all for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake, you have done so practically\r\nas far as it was in your power, and more than this is not required of\r\nanyone. I believe you will not only be a saint, but a very\r\ndistinguished one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words Christina brightened. \xe2\x80\x9cYou give me hope, you give me\r\nhope,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, and dried her eyes. She made him assure her over and\r\nover again that this was his solemn conviction; she did not care about\r\nbeing a distinguished saint now; she would be quite content to be among\r\nthe meanest who actually got into heaven, provided she could make sure\r\nof escaping that awful Hell. The fear of this evidently was omnipresent\r\nwith her, and in spite of all Ernest could say he did not quite dispel\r\nit. She was rather ungrateful, I must confess, for after more than an\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x99s consolation from Ernest she prayed for him that he might have\r\nevery blessing in this world, inasmuch as she always feared that he was\r\nthe only one of her children whom she should never meet in heaven; but\r\nshe was then wandering, and was hardly aware of his presence; her mind\r\nin fact was reverting to states in which it had been before her\r\nillness.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday Ernest went to church as a matter of course, and noted that\r\nthe ever receding tide of Evangelicalism had ebbed many a stage lower,\r\neven during the few years of his absence. His father used to walk to\r\nthe church through the Rectory garden, and across a small intervening\r\nfield. He had been used to walk in a tall hat, his Master\xe2\x80\x99s gown, and\r\nwearing a pair of Geneva bands. Ernest noticed that the bands were worn\r\nno longer, and lo! greater marvel still, Theobald did not preach in his\r\nMaster\xe2\x80\x99s gown, but in a surplice. The whole character of the service\r\nwas changed; you could not say it was high even now, for high-church\r\nTheobald could never under any circumstances become, but the old\r\neasy-going slovenliness, if I may say so, was gone for ever. The\r\norchestral accompaniments to the hymns had disappeared while my hero\r\nwas yet a boy, but there had been no chanting for some years after the\r\nharmonium had been introduced. While Ernest was at Cambridge, Charlotte\r\nand Christina had prevailed on Theobald to allow the canticles to be\r\nsung; and sung they were to old-fashioned double chants by Lord\r\nMornington and Dr Dupuis and others. Theobald did not like it, but he\r\ndid it, or allowed it to be done.\r\n\r\nThen Christina said: \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, do you know, I really think\xe2\x80\x9d (Christina\r\nalways \xe2\x80\x9creally\xe2\x80\x9d thought) \xe2\x80\x9cthat the people like the chanting very much,\r\nand that it will be a means of bringing many to church who have stayed\r\naway hitherto. I was talking about it to Mrs Goodhew and to old Miss\r\nWright only yesterday, and they _quite_ agreed with me, but they all\r\nsaid that we ought to chant the \xe2\x80\x98Glory be to the Father\xe2\x80\x99 at the end of\r\neach of the psalms instead of saying it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheobald looked black\xe2\x80\x94he felt the waters of chanting rising higher and\r\nhigher upon him inch by inch; but he felt also, he knew not why, that\r\nhe had better yield than fight. So he ordered the \xe2\x80\x9cGlory be to the\r\nFather\xe2\x80\x9d to be chanted in future, but he did not like it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, mamma dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlotte, when the battle was won, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nshould not call it the \xe2\x80\x98Glory be to the Father\xe2\x80\x99 you should say\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gloria.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, and she said \xe2\x80\x9cGloria\xe2\x80\x9d for ever\r\nafter. Then she thought what a wonderfully clever girl Charlotte was,\r\nand how she ought to marry no one lower than a bishop. By-and-by when\r\nTheobald went away for an unusually long holiday one summer, he could\r\nfind no one but a rather high-church clergyman to take his duty. This\r\ngentleman was a man of weight in the neighbourhood, having considerable\r\nprivate means, but without preferment. In the summer he would often\r\nhelp his brother clergymen, and it was through his being willing to\r\ntake the duty at Battersby for a few Sundays that Theobald had been\r\nable to get away for so long. On his return, however, he found that the\r\nwhole psalms were being chanted as well as the Glorias. The influential\r\nclergyman, Christina, and Charlotte took the bull by the horns as soon\r\nas Theobald returned, and laughed it all off; and the clergyman laughed\r\nand bounced, and Christina laughed and coaxed, and Charlotte uttered\r\nunexceptionable sentiments, and the thing was done now, and could not\r\nbe undone, and it was no use grieving over spilt milk; so henceforth\r\nthe psalms were to be chanted, but Theobald grisled over it in his\r\nheart, and he did not like it.\r\n\r\nDuring this same absence what had Mrs Goodhew and old Miss Wright taken\r\nto doing but turning towards the east while repeating the Belief?\r\nTheobald disliked this even worse than chanting. When he said something\r\nabout it in a timid way at dinner after service, Charlotte said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, papa dear, you _must_ take to calling it the \xe2\x80\x98Creed\xe2\x80\x99 and not\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98Belief\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d; and Theobald winced impatiently and snorted meek\r\ndefiance, but the spirit of her aunts Jane and Eliza was strong in\r\nCharlotte, and the thing was too small to fight about, and he turned it\r\noff with a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cAs for Charlotte,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Christina, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe she\r\nknows _everything_.\xe2\x80\x9d So Mrs Goodhew and old Miss Wright continued to\r\nturn to the east during the time the Creed was said, and by-and-by\r\nothers followed their example, and ere long the few who had stood out\r\nyielded and turned eastward too; and then Theobald made as though he\r\nhad thought it all very right and proper from the first, but like it he\r\ndid not. By-and-by Charlotte tried to make him say \xe2\x80\x9cAlleluia\xe2\x80\x9d instead\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cHallelujah,\xe2\x80\x9d but this was going too far, and Theobald turned, and\r\nshe got frightened and ran away.\r\n\r\nAnd they changed the double chants for single ones, and altered them\r\npsalm by psalm, and in the middle of psalms, just where a cursory\r\nreader would see no reason why they should do so, they changed from\r\nmajor to minor and from minor back to major; and then they got \xe2\x80\x9cHymns\r\nAncient and Modern,\xe2\x80\x9d and, as I have said, they robbed him of his\r\nbeloved bands, and they made him preach in a surplice, and he must have\r\ncelebration of the Holy Communion once a month instead of only five\r\ntimes in the year as heretofore, and he struggled in vain against the\r\nunseen influence which he felt to be working in season and out of\r\nseason against all that he had been accustomed to consider most\r\ndistinctive of his party. Where it was, or what it was, he knew not,\r\nnor exactly what it would do next, but he knew exceedingly well that go\r\nwhere he would it was undermining him; that it was too persistent for\r\nhim; that Christina and Charlotte liked it a great deal better than he\r\ndid, and that it could end in nothing but Rome. Easter decorations\r\nindeed! Christmas decorations\xe2\x80\x94in reason\xe2\x80\x94were proper enough, but Easter\r\ndecorations! well, it might last his time.\r\n\r\nThis was the course things had taken in the Church of England during\r\nthe last forty years. The set has been steadily in one direction. A few\r\nmen who knew what they wanted made cats\xe2\x80\x99 paws of the Christmas and the\r\nCharlottes, and the Christmas and the Charlottes made cats\xe2\x80\x99 paws of the\r\nMrs Goodhews and the old Miss Wrights, and Mrs Goodhews and old Miss\r\nWrights told the Mr Goodhews and young Miss Wrights what they should\r\ndo, and when the Mr Goodhews and the young Miss Wrights did it the\r\nlittle Goodhews and the rest of the spiritual flock did as they did,\r\nand the Theobalds went for nothing; step by step, day by day, year by\r\nyear, parish by parish, diocese by diocese this was how it was done.\r\nAnd yet the Church of England looks with no friendly eyes upon the\r\ntheory of Evolution or Descent with Modification.\r\n\r\nMy hero thought over these things, and remembered many a _ruse_ on the\r\npart of Christina and Charlotte, and many a detail of the struggle\r\nwhich I cannot further interrupt my story to refer to, and he\r\nremembered his father\xe2\x80\x99s favourite retort that it could only end in\r\nRome. When he was a boy he had firmly believed this, but he smiled now\r\nas he thought of another alternative clear enough to himself, but so\r\nhorrible that it had not even occurred to Theobald\xe2\x80\x94I mean the toppling\r\nover of the whole system. At that time he welcomed the hope that the\r\nabsurdities and unrealities of the Church would end in her downfall.\r\nSince then he has come to think very differently, not as believing in\r\nthe cow jumping over the moon more than he used to, or more, probably,\r\nthan nine-tenths of the clergy themselves\xe2\x80\x94who know as well as he does\r\nthat their outward and visible symbols are out of date\xe2\x80\x94but because he\r\nknows the baffling complexity of the problem when it comes to deciding\r\nwhat is actually to be done. Also, now that he has seen them more\r\nclosely, he knows better the nature of those wolves in sheep\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclothing, who are thirsting for the blood of their victim, and exulting\r\nso clamorously over its anticipated early fall into their clutches. The\r\nspirit behind the Church is true, though her letter\xe2\x80\x94true once\xe2\x80\x94is now\r\ntrue no longer. The spirit behind the High Priests of Science is as\r\nlying as its letter. The Theobalds, who do what they do because it\r\nseems to be the correct thing, but who in their hearts neither like it\r\nnor believe in it, are in reality the least dangerous of all classes to\r\nthe peace and liberties of mankind. The man to fear is he who goes at\r\nthings with the cocksureness of pushing vulgarity and self-conceit.\r\nThese are not vices which can be justly laid to the charge of the\r\nEnglish clergy.\r\n\r\nMany of the farmers came up to Ernest when service was over, and shook\r\nhands with him. He found every one knew of his having come into a\r\nfortune. The fact was that Theobald had immediately told two or three\r\nof the greatest gossips in the village, and the story was not long in\r\nspreading. \xe2\x80\x9cIt simplified matters,\xe2\x80\x9d he had said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9ca good\r\ndeal.\xe2\x80\x9d Ernest was civil to Mrs Goodhew for her husband\xe2\x80\x99s sake, but he\r\ngave Miss Wright the cut direct, for he knew that she was only\r\nCharlotte in disguise.\r\n\r\nA week passed slowly away. Two or three times the family took the\r\nsacrament together round Christina\xe2\x80\x99s death-bed. Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s impatience\r\nbecame more and more transparent daily, but fortunately Christina (who\r\neven if she had been well would have been ready to shut her eyes to it)\r\nbecame weaker and less coherent in mind also, so that she hardly, if at\r\nall, perceived it. After Ernest had been in the house about a week his\r\nmother fell into a comatose state which lasted a couple of days, and in\r\nthe end went away so peacefully that it was like the blending of sea\r\nand sky in mid-ocean upon a soft hazy day when none can say where the\r\nearth ends and the heavens begin. Indeed she died to the realities of\r\nlife with less pain than she had waked from many of its illusions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has been the comfort and mainstay of my life for more than thirty\r\nyears,\xe2\x80\x9d said Theobald as soon as all was over, \xe2\x80\x9cbut one could not wish\r\nit prolonged,\xe2\x80\x9d and he buried his face in his handkerchief to conceal\r\nhis want of emotion.\r\n\r\nErnest came back to town the day after his mother\xe2\x80\x99s death, and returned\r\nto the funeral accompanied by myself. He wanted me to see his father in\r\norder to prevent any possible misapprehension about Miss Pontifex\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nintentions, and I was such an old friend of the family that my presence\r\nat Christina\xe2\x80\x99s funeral would surprise no one. With all her faults I had\r\nalways rather liked Christina. She would have chopped Ernest or any one\r\nelse into little pieces of mincemeat to gratify the slightest wish of\r\nher husband, but she would not have chopped him up for any one else,\r\nand so long as he did not cross her she was very fond of him. By nature\r\nshe was of an even temper, more willing to be pleased than ruffled,\r\nvery ready to do a good-natured action, provided it did not cost her\r\nmuch exertion, nor involve expense to Theobald. Her own little purse\r\ndid not matter; any one might have as much of that as he or she could\r\nget after she had reserved what was absolutely necessary for her dress.\r\nI could not hear of her end as Ernest described it to me without\r\nfeeling very compassionate towards her, indeed her own son could hardly\r\nhave felt more so; I at once, therefore, consented to go down to the\r\nfuneral; perhaps I was also influenced by a desire to see Charlotte and\r\nJoey, in whom I felt interested on hearing what my godson had told me.\r\n\r\nI found Theobald looking remarkably well. Every one said he was bearing\r\nit so beautifully. He did indeed once or twice shake his head and say\r\nthat his wife had been the comfort and mainstay of his life for over\r\nthirty years, but there the matter ended. I stayed over the next day\r\nwhich was Sunday, and took my departure on the following morning after\r\nhaving told Theobald all that his son wished me to tell him. Theobald\r\nasked me to help him with Christina\xe2\x80\x99s epitaph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would say,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cas little as possible; eulogies of the\r\ndeparted are in most cases both unnecessary and untrue. Christina\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nepitaph shall contain nothing which shall be either the one or the\r\nother. I should give her name, the dates of her birth and death, and of\r\ncourse say she was my wife, and then I think I should wind up with a\r\nsimple text\xe2\x80\x94her favourite one for example, none indeed could be more\r\nappropriate, \xe2\x80\x98Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said I thought this would be very nice, and it was settled. So Ernest\r\nwas sent to give the order to Mr Prosser, the stonemason in the nearest\r\ntown, who said it came from \xe2\x80\x9cthe Beetitudes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nOn our way to town Ernest broached his plans for spending the next year\r\nor two. I wanted him to try and get more into society again, but he\r\nbrushed this aside at once as the very last thing he had a fancy for.\r\nFor society indeed of all sorts, except of course that of a few\r\nintimate friends, he had an unconquerable aversion. \xe2\x80\x9cI always did hate\r\nthose people,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand they always have hated and always will\r\nhate me. I am an Ishmael by instinct as much as by accident of\r\ncircumstances, but if I keep out of society I shall be less vulnerable\r\nthan Ishmaels generally are. The moment a man goes into society, he\r\nbecomes vulnerable all round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was very sorry to hear him talk in this way; for whatever strength a\r\nman may have he should surely be able to make more of it if he act in\r\nconcert than alone. I said this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether I make the most of my strength or\r\nnot; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether I have any strength, but if I have I dare say\r\nit will find some way of exerting itself. I will live as I like living,\r\nnot as other people would like me to live; thanks to my aunt and you I\r\ncan afford the luxury of a quiet unobtrusive life of self-indulgence,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cand I mean to have it. You know I like writing,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded after a pause of some minutes, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been a scribbler for\r\nyears. If I am to come to the fore at all it must be by writing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had already long since come to that conclusion myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are a lot of things that want saying which\r\nno one dares to say, a lot of shams which want attacking, and yet no\r\none attacks them. It seems to me that I can say things which not\r\nanother man in England except myself will venture to say, and yet which\r\nare crying to be said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cBut who will listen? If you say things which nobody else would\r\ndare to say is not this much the same as saying what everyone except\r\nyourself knows to be better left unsaid just now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t know it; I am bursting with these\r\nthings, and it is my fate to say them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI knew there would be no stopping him, so I gave in and asked what\r\nquestion he felt a special desire to burn his fingers with in the first\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarriage,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined promptly, \xe2\x80\x9cand the power of disposing of his\r\nproperty after a man is dead. The question of Christianity is virtually\r\nsettled, or if not settled there is no lack of those engaged in\r\nsettling it. The question of the day now is marriage and the family\r\nsystem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d said I drily, \xe2\x80\x9cis a hornet\xe2\x80\x99s nest indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he no less drily, \xe2\x80\x9cbut hornet\xe2\x80\x99s nests are exactly what I\r\nhappen to like. Before, however, I begin to stir up this particular one\r\nI propose to travel for a few years, with the especial object of\r\nfinding out what nations now existing are the best, comeliest and most\r\nlovable, and also what nations have been so in times past. I want to\r\nfind out how these people live, and have lived, and what their customs\r\nare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have very vague notions upon the subject as yet, but the general\r\nimpression I have formed is that, putting ourselves on one side, the\r\nmost vigorous and amiable of known nations are the modern Italians, the\r\nold Greeks and Romans, and the South Sea Islanders. I believe that\r\nthese nice peoples have not as a general rule been purists, but I want\r\nto see those of them who can yet be seen; they are the practical\r\nauthorities on the question\xe2\x80\x94What is best for man? and I should like to\r\nsee them and find out what they do. Let us settle the fact first and\r\nfight about the moral tendencies afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn fact,\xe2\x80\x9d said I laughingly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou mean to have high old times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither higher nor lower,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer, \xe2\x80\x9cthan those people whom I\r\ncan find to have been the best in all ages. But let us change the\r\nsubject.\xe2\x80\x9d He put his hand into his pocket and brought out a letter. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nfather,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cgave me this letter this morning with the seal\r\nalready broken.\xe2\x80\x9d He passed it over to me, and I found it to be the one\r\nwhich Christina had written before the birth of her last child, and\r\nwhich I have given in an earlier chapter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you do not find this letter,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9caffect the conclusion which\r\nyou have just told me you have come to concerning your present plans?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled, and answered: \xe2\x80\x9cNo. But if you do what you have sometimes\r\ntalked about and turn the adventures of my unworthy self into a novel,\r\nmind you print this letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, feeling as though such a letter as this should have\r\nbeen held sacred from the public gaze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause my mother would have wished it published; if she had known you\r\nwere writing about me and had this letter in your possession, she would\r\nabove all things have desired that you should publish it. Therefore\r\npublish it if you write at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis is why I have done so.\r\n\r\nWithin a month Ernest carried his intention into effect, and having\r\nmade all the arrangements necessary for his children\xe2\x80\x99s welfare left\r\nEngland before Christmas.\r\n\r\nI heard from him now and again and learnt that he was visiting almost\r\nall parts of the world, but only staying in those places where he found\r\nthe inhabitants unusually good-looking and agreeable. He said he had\r\nfilled an immense quantity of note-books, and I have no doubt he had.\r\nAt last in the spring of 1867 he returned, his luggage stained with the\r\nvariation of each hotel advertisement \xe2\x80\x99twixt here and Japan. He looked\r\nvery brown and strong, and so well favoured that it almost seemed as if\r\nhe must have caught some good looks from the people among whom he had\r\nbeen living. He came back to his old rooms in the Temple, and settled\r\ndown as easily as if he had never been away a day.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things we did was to go and see the children; we took\r\nthe train to Gravesend, and walked thence for a few miles along the\r\nriverside till we came to the solitary house where the good people\r\nlived with whom Ernest had placed them. It was a lovely April morning,\r\nbut with a fresh air blowing from off the sea; the tide was high, and\r\nthe river was alive with shipping coming up with wind and tide.\r\nSea-gulls wheeled around us overhead, sea-weed clung everywhere to the\r\nbanks which the advancing tide had not yet covered, everything was of\r\nthe sea sea-ey, and the fine bracing air which blew over the water made\r\nme feel more hungry than I had done for many a day; I did not see how\r\nchildren could live in a better physical atmosphere than this, and\r\napplauded the selection which Ernest had made on behalf of his\r\nyoungsters.\r\n\r\nWhile we were still a quarter of a mile off we heard shouts and\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s laughter, and could see a lot of boys and girls romping\r\ntogether and running after one another. We could not distinguish our\r\nown two, but when we got near they were soon made out, for the other\r\nchildren were blue-eyed, flaxen-pated little folks, whereas ours were\r\ndark and straight-haired.\r\n\r\nWe had written to say that we were coming, but had desired that nothing\r\nshould be said to the children, so these paid no more attention to us\r\nthan they would have done to any other stranger, who happened to visit\r\na spot so unfrequented except by sea-faring folk, which we plainly were\r\nnot. The interest, however, in us was much quickened when it was\r\ndiscovered that we had got our pockets full of oranges and sweeties, to\r\nan extent greater than it had entered into their small imaginations to\r\nconceive as possible. At first we had great difficulty in making them\r\ncome near us. They were like a lot of wild young colts, very\r\ninquisitive, but very coy and not to be cajoled easily. The children\r\nwere nine in all\xe2\x80\x94five boys and two girls belonging to Mr and Mrs\r\nRollings, and two to Ernest. I never saw a finer lot of children than\r\nthe young Rollings, the boys were hardy, robust, fearless little\r\nfellows with eyes as clear as hawks; the elder girl was exquisitely\r\npretty, but the younger one was a mere baby. I felt as I looked at\r\nthem, that if I had had children of my own I could have wished no\r\nbetter home for them, nor better companions.\r\n\r\nGeorgie and Alice, Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s two children, were evidently quite as one\r\nfamily with the others, and called Mr and Mrs Rollings uncle and aunt.\r\nThey had been so young when they were first brought to the house that\r\nthey had been looked upon in the light of new babies who had been born\r\ninto the family. They knew nothing about Mr and Mrs Rollings being paid\r\nso much a week to look after them. Ernest asked them all what they\r\nwanted to be. They had only one idea; one and all, Georgie among the\r\nrest, wanted to be bargemen. Young ducks could hardly have a more\r\nevident hankering after the water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you want, Alice?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ernest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to marry Jack here, and be a bargeman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJack was the eldest boy, now nearly twelve, a sturdy little fellow, the\r\nimage of what Mr Rollings must have been at his age. As we looked at\r\nhim, so straight and well grown and well done all round, I could see it\r\nwas in Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s mind as much as in mine that she could hardly do much\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, Jack, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ernest, \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s a shilling for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe boy blushed and could hardly be got to come in spite of our\r\nprevious blandishments; he had had pennies given him before, but\r\nshillings never. His father caught him good-naturedly by the ear and\r\nlugged him to us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a good boy, Jack is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ernest to Mr Rollings, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure of\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Rollings, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s a werry good boy, only that I can\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nhim to learn his reading and writing. He don\xe2\x80\x99t like going to school,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the only complaint I have against him. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmatter with all my children, and yours, Mr Pontifex, is just as bad,\r\nbut they none of \xe2\x80\x99em likes book learning, though they learn anything\r\nelse fast enough. Why, as for Jack here, he\xe2\x80\x99s almost as good a bargeman\r\nas I am.\xe2\x80\x9d And he looked fondly and patronisingly towards his offspring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ernest to Mr Rollings, \xe2\x80\x9cif he wants to marry Alice when\r\nhe gets older he had better do so, and he shall have as many barges as\r\nhe likes. In the meantime, Mr Rollings, say in what way money can be of\r\nuse to you, and whatever you can make useful is at your disposal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that Ernest made matters easy for this good couple;\r\none stipulation, however, he insisted on, namely, there was to be no\r\nmore smuggling, and that the young people were to be kept out of this;\r\nfor a little bird had told Ernest that smuggling in a quiet way was one\r\nof the resources of the Rollings family. Mr Rollings was not sorry to\r\nassent to this, and I believe it is now many years since the coastguard\r\npeople have suspected any of the Rollings family as offenders against\r\nthe revenue law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I take them from where they are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ernest to me in the\r\ntrain as we went home, \xe2\x80\x9cto send them to schools where they will not be\r\none half so happy, and where their illegitimacy will very likely be a\r\nworry to them? Georgie wants to be a bargeman, let him begin as one,\r\nthe sooner the better; he may as well begin with this as with anything\r\nelse; then if he shows developments I can be on the look-out to\r\nencourage them and make things easy for him; while if he shows no\r\ndesire to go ahead, what on earth is the good of trying to shove him\r\nforward?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest, I believe, went on with a homily upon education generally, and\r\nupon the way in which young people should go through the embryonic\r\nstages with their money as much as with their limbs, beginning life in\r\na much lower social position than that in which their parents were, and\r\na lot more, which he has since published; but I was getting on in\r\nyears, and the walk and the bracing air had made me sleepy, so ere we\r\nhad got past Greenhithe Station on our return journey I had sunk into a\r\nrefreshing sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nErnest being about two and thirty years old and having had his fling\r\nfor the last three or four years, now settled down in London, and began\r\nto write steadily. Up to this time he had given abundant promise, but\r\nhad produced nothing, nor indeed did he come before the public for\r\nanother three or four years yet.\r\n\r\nHe lived as I have said very quietly, seeing hardly anyone but myself,\r\nand the three or four old friends with whom I had been intimate for\r\nyears. Ernest and we formed our little set, and outside of this my\r\ngodson was hardly known at all.\r\n\r\nHis main expense was travelling, which he indulged in at frequent\r\nintervals, but for short times only. Do what he would he could not get\r\nthrough more than about fifteen hundred a year; the rest of his income\r\nhe gave away if he happened to find a case where he thought money would\r\nbe well bestowed, or put by until some opportunity arose of getting rid\r\nof it with advantage.\r\n\r\nI knew he was writing, but we had had so many little differences of\r\nopinion upon this head that by a tacit understanding the subject was\r\nseldom referred to between us, and I did not know that he was actually\r\npublishing till one day he brought me a book and told me flat it was\r\nhis own. I opened it and found it to be a series of semi-theological,\r\nsemi-social essays, purporting to have been written by six or seven\r\ndifferent people, and viewing the same class of subjects from different\r\nstandpoints.\r\n\r\nPeople had not yet forgotten the famous \xe2\x80\x9cEssays and Reviews,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nErnest had wickedly given a few touches to at least two of the essays\r\nwhich suggested vaguely that they had been written by a bishop. The\r\nessays were all of them in support of the Church of England, and\r\nappeared both by internal suggestion, and their prima facie purport to\r\nbe the work of some half-dozen men of experience and high position who\r\nhad determined to face the difficult questions of the day no less\r\nboldly from within the bosom of the Church than the Church\xe2\x80\x99s enemies\r\nhad faced them from without her pale.\r\n\r\nThere was an essay on the external evidences of the Resurrection;\r\nanother on the marriage laws of the most eminent nations of the world\r\nin times past and present; another was devoted to a consideration of\r\nthe many questions which must be reopened and reconsidered on their\r\nmerits if the teaching of the Church of England were to cease to carry\r\nmoral authority with it; another dealt with the more purely social\r\nsubject of middle class destitution; another with the authenticity or\r\nrather the unauthenticity of the fourth gospel\xe2\x80\x94another was headed\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIrrational Rationalism,\xe2\x80\x9d and there were two or three more.\r\n\r\nThey were all written vigorously and fearlessly as though by people\r\nused to authority; all granted that the Church professed to enjoin\r\nbelief in much which no one could accept who had been accustomed to\r\nweigh evidence; but it was contended that so much valuable truth had\r\ngot so closely mixed up with these mistakes, that the mistakes had\r\nbetter not be meddled with. To lay great stress on these was like\r\ncavilling at the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s right to reign, on the ground that William the\r\nConqueror was illegitimate.\r\n\r\nOne article maintained that though it would be inconvenient to change\r\nthe words of our prayer book and articles, it would not be inconvenient\r\nto change in a quiet way the meanings which we put upon those words.\r\nThis, it was argued, was what was actually done in the case of law;\r\nthis had been the law\xe2\x80\x99s mode of growth and adaptation, and had in all\r\nages been found a righteous and convenient method of effecting change.\r\nIt was suggested that the Church should adopt it.\r\n\r\nIn another essay it was boldly denied that the Church rested upon\r\nreason. It was proved incontestably that its ultimate foundation was\r\nand ought to be faith, there being indeed no other ultimate foundation\r\nthan this for any of man\xe2\x80\x99s beliefs. If so, the writer claimed that the\r\nChurch could not be upset by reason. It was founded, like everything\r\nelse, on initial assumptions, that is to say on faith, and if it was to\r\nbe upset it was to be upset by faith, by the faith of those who in\r\ntheir lives appeared more graceful, more lovable, better bred, in fact,\r\nand better able to overcome difficulties. Any sect which showed its\r\nsuperiority in these respects might carry all before it, but none other\r\nwould make much headway for long together. Christianity was true in so\r\nfar as it had fostered beauty, and it had fostered much beauty. It was\r\nfalse in so far as it fostered ugliness, and it had fostered much\r\nugliness. It was therefore not a little true and not a little false; on\r\nthe whole one might go farther and fare worse; the wisest course would\r\nbe to live with it, and make the best and not the worst of it. The\r\nwriter urged that we become persecutors as a matter of course as soon\r\nas we begin to feel very strongly upon any subject; we ought not\r\ntherefore to do this; we ought not to feel very strongly\xe2\x80\x94even upon that\r\ninstitution which was dearer to the writer than any other\xe2\x80\x94the Church of\r\nEngland. We should be churchmen, but somewhat lukewarm churchmen,\r\ninasmuch as those who care very much about either religion or\r\nirreligion are seldom observed to be very well bred or agreeable\r\npeople. The Church herself should approach as nearly to that of\r\nLaodicea as was compatible with her continuing to be a Church at all,\r\nand each individual member should only be hot in striving to be as\r\nlukewarm as possible.\r\n\r\nThe book rang with the courage alike of conviction and of an entire\r\nabsence of conviction; it appeared to be the work of men who had a\r\nrule-of-thumb way of steering between iconoclasm on the one hand and\r\ncredulity on the other; who cut Gordian knots as a matter of course\r\nwhen it suited their convenience; who shrank from no conclusion in\r\ntheory, nor from any want of logic in practice so long as they were\r\nillogical of malice prepense, and for what they held to be sufficient\r\nreason. The conclusions were conservative, quietistic, comforting. The\r\narguments by which they were reached were taken from the most advanced\r\nwriters of the day. All that these people contended for was granted\r\nthem, but the fruits of victory were for the most part handed over to\r\nthose already in possession.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the passage which attracted most attention in the book was one\r\nfrom the essay on the various marriage systems of the world. It ran:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf people require us to construct,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the writer, \xe2\x80\x9cwe set good\r\nbreeding as the corner-stone of our edifice. We would have it ever\r\npresent consciously or unconsciously in the minds of all as the central\r\nfaith in which they should live and move and have their being, as the\r\ntouchstone of all things whereby they may be known as good or evil\r\naccording as they make for good breeding or against it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat a man should have been bred well and breed others well; that his\r\nfigure, head, hands, feet, voice, manner and clothes should carry\r\nconviction upon this point, so that no one can look at him without\r\nseeing that he has come of good stock and is likely to throw good stock\r\nhimself, this is the _desiderandum_. And the same with a woman. The\r\ngreatest number of these well-bred men and women, and the greatest\r\nhappiness of these well-bred men and women, this is the highest good;\r\ntowards this all government, all social conventions, all art,\r\nliterature and science should directly or indirectly tend. Holy men and\r\nholy women are those who keep this unconsciously in view at all times\r\nwhether of work or pastime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Ernest had published this work in his own name I should think it\r\nwould have fallen stillborn from the press, but the form he had chosen\r\nwas calculated at that time to arouse curiosity, and as I have said he\r\nhad wickedly dropped a few hints which the reviewers did not think\r\nanyone would have been impudent enough to do if he were not a bishop,\r\nor at any rate some one in authority. A well-known judge was spoken of\r\nas being another of the writers, and the idea spread ere long that six\r\nor seven of the leading bishops and judges had laid their heads\r\ntogether to produce a volume, which should at once outbid \xe2\x80\x9cEssays and\r\nReviews\xe2\x80\x9d and counteract the influence of that then still famous work.\r\n\r\nReviewers are men of like passions with ourselves, and with them as\r\nwith everyone else _omne ignotum pro magnifico_. The book was really an\r\nable one and abounded with humour, just satire, and good sense. It\r\nstruck a new note and the speculation which for some time was rife\r\nconcerning its authorship made many turn to it who would never have\r\nlooked at it otherwise. One of the most gushing weeklies had a fit over\r\nit, and declared it to be the finest thing that had been done since the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProvincial Letters\xe2\x80\x9d of Pascal. Once a month or so that weekly always\r\nfound some picture which was the finest that had been done since the\r\nold masters, or some satire that was the finest that had appeared since\r\nSwift or some something which was incomparably the finest that had\r\nappeared since something else. If Ernest had put his name to the book,\r\nand the writer had known that it was by a nobody, he would doubtless\r\nhave written in a very different strain. Reviewers like to think that\r\nfor aught they know they are patting a Duke or even a Prince of the\r\nblood upon the back, and lay it on thick till they find they have been\r\nonly praising Brown, Jones or Robinson. Then they are disappointed, and\r\nas a general rule will pay Brown, Jones or Robinson out.\r\n\r\nErnest was not so much up to the ropes of the literary world as I was,\r\nand I am afraid his head was a little turned when he woke up one\r\nmorning to find himself famous. He was Christina\xe2\x80\x99s son, and perhaps\r\nwould not have been able to do what he had done if he was not capable\r\nof occasional undue elation. Ere long, however, he found out all about\r\nit, and settled quietly down to write a series of books, in which he\r\ninsisted on saying things which no one else would say even if they\r\ncould, or could even if they would.\r\n\r\nHe has got himself a bad literary character. I said to him laughingly\r\none day that he was like the man in the last century of whom it was\r\nsaid that nothing but such a character could keep down such parts.\r\n\r\nHe laughed and said he would rather be like that than like a modern\r\nwriter or two whom he could name, whose parts were so poor that they\r\ncould be kept up by nothing but by such a character.\r\n\r\nI remember soon after one of these books was published I happened to\r\nmeet Mrs Jupp to whom, by the way, Ernest made a small weekly\r\nallowance. It was at Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s chambers, and for some reason we were\r\nleft alone for a few minutes. I said to her: \xe2\x80\x9cMr Pontifex has written\r\nanother book, Mrs Jupp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor\xe2\x80\x99 now,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9chas he really? Dear gentleman! Is it about\r\nlove?\xe2\x80\x9d And the old sinner threw up a wicked sheep\xe2\x80\x99s eye glance at me\r\nfrom under her aged eyelids. I forget what there was in my reply which\r\nprovoked it\xe2\x80\x94probably nothing\xe2\x80\x94but she went rattling on at full speed to\r\nthe effect that Bell had given her a ticket for the opera, \xe2\x80\x9cSo, of\r\ncourse,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI went. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand one word of it, for it\r\nwas all French, but I saw their legs. Oh dear, oh dear! I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\r\nshan\xe2\x80\x99t be here much longer, and when dear Mr Pontifex sees me in my\r\ncoffin he\xe2\x80\x99ll say, \xe2\x80\x98Poor old Jupp, she\xe2\x80\x99ll never talk broad any more\xe2\x80\x99;\r\nbut bless you I\xe2\x80\x99m not so old as all that, and I\xe2\x80\x99m taking lessons in\r\ndancing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment Ernest came in and the conversation was changed. Mrs\r\nJupp asked if he was still going on writing more books now that this\r\none was done. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I am,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m always writing books;\r\nhere is the manuscript of my next;\xe2\x80\x9d and he showed her a heap of paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cdear, dear me, and is that manuscript? I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\noften heard talk about manuscripts, but I never thought I should live\r\nto see some myself. Well! well! So that is really manuscript?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were a few geraniums in the window and they did not look well.\r\nErnest asked Mrs Jupp if she understood flowers. \xe2\x80\x9cI understand the\r\nlanguage of flowers,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with one of her most bewitching leers,\r\nand on this we sent her off till she should choose to honour us with\r\nanother visit, which she knows she is privileged from time to time to\r\ndo, for Ernest likes her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now I must bring my story to a close.\r\n\r\nThe preceding chapter was written soon after the events it records\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nis to say in the spring of 1867. By that time my story had been written\r\nup to this point; but it has been altered here and there from time to\r\ntime occasionally. It is now the autumn of 1882, and if I am to say\r\nmore I should do so quickly, for I am eighty years old and though well\r\nin health cannot conceal from myself that I am no longer young. Ernest\r\nhimself is forty-seven, though he hardly looks it.\r\n\r\nHe is richer than ever, for he has never married and his London and\r\nNorth-Western shares have nearly doubled themselves. Through sheer\r\ninability to spend his income he has been obliged to hoard in\r\nself-defence. He still lives in the Temple in the same rooms I took for\r\nhim when he gave up his shop, for no one has been able to induce him to\r\ntake a house. His house, he says, is wherever there is a good hotel.\r\nWhen he is in town he likes to work and to be quiet. When out of town\r\nhe feels that he has left little behind him that can go wrong, and he\r\nwould not like to be tied to a single locality. \xe2\x80\x9cI know no exception,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe says, \xe2\x80\x9cto the rule that it is cheaper to buy milk than to keep a\r\ncow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I have mentioned Mrs Jupp, I may as well say here the little that\r\nremains to be said about her. She is a very old woman now, but no one\r\nnow living, as she says triumphantly, can say how old, for the woman in\r\nthe Old Kent Road is dead, and presumably has carried her secret to the\r\ngrave. Old, however, though she is, she lives in the same house, and\r\nfinds it hard work to make the two ends meet, but I do not know that\r\nshe minds this very much, and it has prevented her from getting more to\r\ndrink than would be good for her. It is no use trying to do anything\r\nfor her beyond paying her allowance weekly, and absolutely refusing to\r\nlet her anticipate it. She pawns her flat iron every Saturday for 4d.,\r\nand takes it out every Monday morning for 4.5d. when she gets her\r\nallowance, and has done this for the last ten years as regularly as the\r\nweek comes round. As long as she does not let the flat iron actually go\r\nwe know that she can still worry out her financial problems in her own\r\nhugger-mugger way and had better be left to do so. If the flat iron\r\nwere to go beyond redemption, we should know that it was time to\r\ninterfere. I do not know why, but there is something about her which\r\nalways reminds me of a woman who was as unlike her as one person can be\r\nto another\xe2\x80\x94I mean Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s mother.\r\n\r\nThe last time I had a long gossip with her was about two years ago when\r\nshe came to me instead of to Ernest. She said she had seen a cab drive\r\nup just as she was going to enter the staircase, and had seen Mr\r\nPontifex\xe2\x80\x99s pa put his Beelzebub old head out of the window, so she had\r\ncome on to me, for she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t greased her sides for no curtsey, not for\r\nthe likes of him. She professed to be very much down on her luck. Her\r\nlodgers did use her so dreadful, going away without paying and leaving\r\nnot so much as a stick behind, but to-day she was as pleased as a penny\r\ncarrot. She had had such a lovely dinner\xe2\x80\x94a cushion of ham and green\r\npeas. She had had a good cry over it, but then she was so silly, she\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s that Bell,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, though I could not detect any\r\nappearance of connection, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s enough to give anyone the hump to see\r\nhim now that he\xe2\x80\x99s taken to chapel-going, and his mother\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to\r\nmeet Jesus and all that to me, and now she ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-going to die, and\r\ndrinks half a bottle of champagne a day, and then Grigg, him as\r\npreaches, you know, asked Bell if I really was too gay, not but what\r\nwhen I was young I\xe2\x80\x99d snap my fingers at any \xe2\x80\x98fly by night\xe2\x80\x99 in Holborn,\r\nand if I was togged out and had my teeth I\xe2\x80\x99d do it now. I lost my poor\r\ndear Watkins, but of course that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be helped, and then I lost my\r\ndear Rose. Silly faggot to go and ride on a cart and catch the\r\nbronchitics. I never thought when I kissed my dear Rose in Pullen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nPassage and she gave me the chop, that I should never see her again,\r\nand her gentleman friend was fond of her too, though he was a married\r\nman. I daresay she\xe2\x80\x99s gone to bits by now. If she could rise and see me\r\nwith my bad finger, she would cry, and I should say, \xe2\x80\x98Never mind,\r\nducky, I\xe2\x80\x99m all right.\xe2\x80\x99 Oh! dear, it\xe2\x80\x99s coming on to rain. I do hate a\r\nwet Saturday night\xe2\x80\x94poor women with their nice white stockings and their\r\nliving to get,\xe2\x80\x9d etc., etc.\r\n\r\nAnd yet age does not wither this godless old sinner, as people would\r\nsay it ought to do. Whatever life she has led, it has agreed with her\r\nvery sufficiently. At times she gives us to understand that she is\r\nstill much solicited; at others she takes quite a different tone. She\r\nhas not allowed even Joe King so much as to put his lips to hers this\r\nten years. She would rather have a mutton chop any day. \xe2\x80\x9cBut ah! you\r\nshould have seen me when I was sweet seventeen. I was the very moral of\r\nmy poor dear mother, and she was a pretty woman, though I say it that\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. She had such a splendid mouth of teeth. It was a sin to bury\r\nher in her teeth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI only knew of one thing at which she professes to be shocked. It is\r\nthat her son Tom and his wife Topsy are teaching the baby to swear.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it\xe2\x80\x99s too dreadful awful,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know the meaning\r\nof the words, but I tell him he\xe2\x80\x99s a drunken sot.\xe2\x80\x9d I believe the old\r\nwoman in reality rather likes it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely, Mrs Jupp,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cTom\xe2\x80\x99s wife used not to be Topsy. You\r\nused to speak of her as Pheeb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! yes,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cbut Pheeb behaved bad, and it\xe2\x80\x99s Topsy now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x99s daughter Alice married the boy who had been her playmate more\r\nthan a year ago. Ernest gave them all they said they wanted and a good\r\ndeal more. They have already presented him with a grandson, and I doubt\r\nnot, will do so with many more. Georgie though only twenty-one is owner\r\nof a fine steamer which his father has bought for him. He began when\r\nabout thirteen going with old Rollings and Jack in the barge from\r\nRochester to the upper Thames with bricks; then his father bought him\r\nand Jack barges of their own, and then he bought them both ships, and\r\nthen steamers. I do not exactly know how people make money by having a\r\nsteamer, but he does whatever is usual, and from all I can gather makes\r\nit pay extremely well. He is a good deal like his father in the face,\r\nbut without a spark\xe2\x80\x94so far as I have been able to observe\xe2\x80\x94any literary\r\nability; he has a fair sense of humour and abundance of common sense,\r\nbut his instinct is clearly a practical one. I am not sure that he does\r\nnot put me in mind almost more of what Theobald would have been if he\r\nhad been a sailor, than of Ernest. Ernest used to go down to Battersby\r\nand stay with his father for a few days twice a year until Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath, and the pair continued on excellent terms, in spite of what the\r\nneighbouring clergy call \xe2\x80\x9cthe atrocious books which Mr Ernest Pontifex\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhas written. Perhaps the harmony, or rather absence of discord which\r\nsubsisted between the pair was due to the fact that Theobald had never\r\nlooked into the inside of one of his son\xe2\x80\x99s works, and Ernest, of\r\ncourse, never alluded to them in his father\xe2\x80\x99s presence. The pair, as I\r\nhave said, got on excellently, but it was doubtless as well that\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x99s visits were short and not too frequent. Once Theobald wanted\r\nErnest to bring his children, but Ernest knew they would not like it,\r\nso this was not done.\r\n\r\nSometimes Theobald came up to town on small business matters and paid a\r\nvisit to Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s chambers; he generally brought with him a couple of\r\nlettuces, or a cabbage, or half-a-dozen turnips done up in a piece of\r\nbrown paper, and told Ernest that he knew fresh vegetables were rather\r\nhard to get in London, and he had brought him some. Ernest had often\r\nexplained to him that the vegetables were of no use to him, and that he\r\nhad rather he would not bring them; but Theobald persisted, I believe\r\nthrough sheer love of doing something which his son did not like, but\r\nwhich was too small to take notice of.\r\n\r\nHe lived until about twelve months ago, when he was found dead in his\r\nbed on the morning after having written the following letter to his\r\nson:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Ernest,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing particular to write about, but your letter\r\nhas been lying for some days in the limbo of unanswered letters, to wit\r\nmy pocket, and it\xe2\x80\x99s time it was answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI keep wonderfully well and am able to walk my five or six miles with\r\ncomfort, but at my age there\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing how long it will last, and\r\ntime flies quickly. I have been busy potting plants all the morning,\r\nbut this afternoon is wet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this horrid Government going to do with Ireland? I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexactly wish they\xe2\x80\x99d blow up Mr Gladstone, but if a mad bull would chivy\r\nhim there, and he would never come back any more, I should not be\r\nsorry. Lord Hartington is not exactly the man I should like to set in\r\nhis place, but he would be immeasurably better than Gladstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI miss your sister Charlotte more than I can express. She kept my\r\nhousehold accounts, and I could pour out to her all little worries, and\r\nnow that Joey is married too, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I should do if one or\r\nother of them did not come sometimes and take care of me. My only\r\ncomfort is that Charlotte will make her husband happy, and that he is\r\nas nearly worthy of her as a husband can well be.\xe2\x80\x94Believe me, Your\r\naffectionate father,\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHEOBALD PONTIFEX.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI may say in passing that though Theobald speaks of Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmarriage as though it were recent, it had really taken place some six\r\nyears previously, she being then about thirty-eight years old, and her\r\nhusband about seven years younger.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt that Theobald passed peacefully away during his\r\nsleep. Can a man who died thus be said to have died at all? He has\r\npresented the phenomena of death to other people, but in respect of\r\nhimself he has not only not died, but has not even thought that he was\r\ngoing to die. This is not more than half dying, but then neither was\r\nhis life more than half living. He presented so many of the phenomena\r\nof living that I suppose on the whole it would be less trouble to think\r\nof him as having been alive than as never having been born at all, but\r\nthis is only possible because association does not stick to the strict\r\nletter of its bond.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was not the general verdict concerning him, and the\r\ngeneral verdict is often the truest.\r\n\r\nErnest was overwhelmed with expressions of condolence and respect for\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s memory. \xe2\x80\x9cHe never,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr Martin, the old doctor who\r\nbrought Ernest into the world, \xe2\x80\x9cspoke an ill word against anyone. He\r\nwas not only liked, he was beloved by all who had anything to do with\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA more perfectly just and righteously dealing man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the family\r\nsolicitor, \xe2\x80\x9cI have never had anything to do with\xe2\x80\x94nor one more punctual\r\nin the discharge of every business obligation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall miss him sadly,\xe2\x80\x9d the bishop wrote to Joey in the very warmest\r\nterms. The poor were in consternation. \xe2\x80\x9cThe well\xe2\x80\x99s never missed,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\none old woman, \xe2\x80\x9ctill it\xe2\x80\x99s dry,\xe2\x80\x9d and she only said what everyone else\r\nfelt. Ernest knew that the general regret was unaffected as for a loss\r\nwhich could not be easily repaired. He felt that there were only three\r\npeople in the world who joined insincerely in the tribute of applause,\r\nand these were the very three who could least show their want of\r\nsympathy. I mean Joey, Charlotte, and himself. He felt bitter against\r\nhimself for being of a mind with either Joey or Charlotte upon any\r\nsubject, and thankful that he must conceal his being so as far as\r\npossible, not because of anything his father had done to him\xe2\x80\x94these\r\ngrievances were too old to be remembered now\xe2\x80\x94but because he would never\r\nallow him to feel towards him as he was always trying to feel. As long\r\nas communication was confined to the merest commonplace all went well,\r\nbut if these were departed from ever such a little he invariably felt\r\nthat his father\xe2\x80\x99s instincts showed themselves in immediate opposition\r\nto his own. When he was attacked his father laid whatever stress was\r\npossible on everything which his opponents said. If he met with any\r\ncheck his father was clearly pleased. What the old doctor had said\r\nabout Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s speaking ill of no man was perfectly true as regards\r\nothers than himself, but he knew very well that no one had injured his\r\nreputation in a quiet way, so far as he dared to do, more than his own\r\nfather. This is a very common case and a very natural one. It often\r\nhappens that if the son is right, the father is wrong, and the father\r\nis not going to have this if he can help it.\r\n\r\nIt was very hard, however, to say what was the true root of the\r\nmischief in the present case. It was not Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s having been\r\nimprisoned. Theobald forgot all about that much sooner than nine\r\nfathers out of ten would have done. Partly, no doubt, it was due to\r\nincompatibility of temperament, but I believe the main ground of\r\ncomplaint lay in the fact that he had been so independent and so rich\r\nwhile still very young, and that thus the old gentleman had been robbed\r\nof his power to tease and scratch in the way which he felt he was\r\nentitled to do. The love of teasing in a small way when he felt safe in\r\ndoing so had remained part of his nature from the days when he told his\r\nnurse that he would keep her on purpose to torment her. I suppose it is\r\nso with all of us. At any rate I am sure that most fathers, especially\r\nif they are clergymen, are like Theobald.\r\n\r\nHe did not in reality, I am convinced, like Joey or Charlotte one whit\r\nbetter than he liked Ernest. He did not like anyone or anything, or if\r\nhe liked anyone at all it was his butler, who looked after him when he\r\nwas not well, and took great care of him and believed him to be the\r\nbest and ablest man in the whole world. Whether this faithful and\r\nattached servant continued to think this after Theobald\xe2\x80\x99s will was\r\nopened and it was found what kind of legacy had been left him I know\r\nnot. Of his children, the baby who had died at a day old was the only\r\none whom he held to have treated him quite filially. As for Christina\r\nhe hardly ever pretended to miss her and never mentioned her name; but\r\nthis was taken as a proof that he felt her loss too keenly to be able\r\never to speak of her. It may have been so, but I do not think it.\r\n\r\nTheobald\xe2\x80\x99s effects were sold by auction, and among them the Harmony of\r\nthe Old and New Testaments which he had compiled during many years with\r\nsuch exquisite neatness and a huge collection of MS. sermons\xe2\x80\x94being all\r\nin fact that he had ever written. These and the Harmony fetched\r\nninepence a barrow load. I was surprised to hear that Joey had not\r\ngiven the three or four shillings which would have bought the whole\r\nlot, but Ernest tells me that Joey was far fiercer in his dislike of\r\nhis father than ever he had been himself, and wished to get rid of\r\neverything that reminded him of him.\r\n\r\nIt has already appeared that both Joey and Charlotte are married. Joey\r\nhas a family, but he and Ernest very rarely have any intercourse. Of\r\ncourse, Ernest took nothing under his father\xe2\x80\x99s will; this had long been\r\nunderstood, so that the other two are both well provided for.\r\n\r\nCharlotte is as clever as ever, and sometimes asks Ernest to come and\r\nstay with her and her husband near Dover, I suppose because she knows\r\nthat the invitation will not be agreeable to him. There is a _de haut\r\nen bas_ tone in all her letters; it is rather hard to lay one\xe2\x80\x99s finger\r\nupon it but Ernest never gets a letter from her without feeling that he\r\nis being written to by one who has had direct communication with an\r\nangel. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat an awful creature,\xe2\x80\x9d he once said to me, \xe2\x80\x9cthat angel must\r\nhave been if it had anything to do with making Charlotte what she is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould you like,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote to him not long ago, \xe2\x80\x9cthe thoughts of a\r\nlittle sea change here? The top of the cliffs will soon be bright with\r\nheather: the gorse must be out already, and the heather I should think\r\nbegun, to judge by the state of the hill at Ewell, and heather or no\r\nheather\xe2\x80\x94the cliffs are always beautiful, and if you come your room\r\nshall be cosy so that you may have a resting corner to yourself.\r\nNineteen and sixpence is the price of a return-ticket which covers a\r\nmonth. Would you decide just as you would yourself like, only if you\r\ncome we would hope to try and make it bright for you; but you must not\r\nfeel it a burden on your mind if you feel disinclined to come in this\r\ndirection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I have a bad nightmare,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ernest to me, laughing as he showed\r\nme this letter, \xe2\x80\x9cI dream that I have got to stay with Charlotte.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer letters are supposed to be unusually well written, and I believe it\r\nis said among the family that Charlotte has far more real literary\r\npower than Ernest has. Sometimes we think that she is writing at him as\r\nmuch as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cThere now\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you think you are the only one of us\r\nwho can write; read this! And if you want a telling bit of descriptive\r\nwriting for your next book, you can make what use of it you like.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\ndaresay she writes very well, but she has fallen under the dominion of\r\nthe words \xe2\x80\x9chope,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthink,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfeel,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ctry,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbright,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clittle,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\ncan hardly write a page without introducing all these words and some of\r\nthem more than once. All this has the effect of making her style\r\nmonotonous.\r\n\r\nErnest is as fond of music as ever, perhaps more so, and of late years\r\nhas added musical composition to the other irons in his fire. He finds\r\nit still a little difficult, and is in constant trouble through getting\r\ninto the key of C sharp after beginning in the key of C and being\r\nunable to get back again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGetting into the key of C sharp,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis like an unprotected\r\nfemale travelling on the Metropolitan Railway, and finding herself at\r\nShepherd\xe2\x80\x99s Bush, without quite knowing where she wants to go to. How is\r\nshe ever to get safe back to Clapham Junction? And Clapham Junction\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t quite do either, for Clapham Junction is like the diminished\r\nseventh\xe2\x80\x94susceptible of such enharmonic change, that you can resolve it\r\ninto all the possible termini of music.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTalking of music reminds me of a little passage that took place between\r\nErnest and Miss Skinner, Dr Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s eldest daughter, not so very long\r\nago. Dr Skinner had long left Roughborough, and had become Dean of a\r\nCathedral in one of our Midland counties\xe2\x80\x94a position which exactly\r\nsuited him. Finding himself once in the neighbourhood Ernest called,\r\nfor old acquaintance sake, and was hospitably entertained at lunch.\r\n\r\nThirty years had whitened the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s bushy eyebrows\xe2\x80\x94his hair they\r\ncould not whiten. I believe that but for that wig he would have been\r\nmade a bishop.\r\n\r\nHis voice and manner were unchanged, and when Ernest remarking upon a\r\nplan of Rome which hung in the hall, spoke inadvertently of the\r\nQuirinal, he replied with all his wonted pomp: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, the QuirInal\xe2\x80\x94or as\r\nI myself prefer to call it, the QuirInal.\xe2\x80\x9d After this triumph he\r\ninhaled a long breath through the corners of his mouth, and flung it\r\nback again into the face of Heaven, as in his finest form during his\r\nhead-mastership. At lunch he did indeed once say, \xe2\x80\x9cnext to impossible\r\nto think of anything else,\xe2\x80\x9d but he immediately corrected himself and\r\nsubstituted the words, \xe2\x80\x9cnext to impossible to entertain irrelevant\r\nideas,\xe2\x80\x9d after which he seemed to feel a good deal more comfortable.\r\nErnest saw the familiar volumes of Dr Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s works upon the\r\nbookshelves in the Deanery dining-room, but he saw no copy of \xe2\x80\x9cRome or\r\nthe Bible\xe2\x80\x94Which?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you still as fond of music as ever, Mr Pontifex?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nSkinner to Ernest during the course of lunch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf some kinds of music, yes, Miss Skinner, but you know I never did\r\nlike modern music.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that rather dreadful?\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think you rather\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she was going\r\nto have added, \xe2\x80\x9cought to?\xe2\x80\x9d but she left it unsaid, feeling doubtless\r\nthat she had sufficiently conveyed her meaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would like modern music, if I could; I have been trying all my life\r\nto like it, but I succeed less and less the older I grow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray, where do you consider modern music to begin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith Sebastian Bach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t you like Beethoven?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I used to think I did, when I was younger, but I know now that I\r\nnever really liked him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! how can you say so? You cannot understand him, you never could say\r\nthis if you understood him. For me a simple chord of Beethoven is\r\nenough. This is happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErnest was amused at her strong family likeness to her father\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nlikeness which had grown upon her as she had become older, and which\r\nextended even to voice and manner of speaking. He remembered how he had\r\nheard me describe the game of chess I had played with the doctor in\r\ndays gone by, and with his mind\xe2\x80\x99s ear seemed to hear Miss Skinner\r\nsaying, as though it were an epitaph:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay:\r\nI may presently take\r\nA simple chord of Beethoven,\r\nOr a small semiquaver\r\nFrom one of Mendelssohn\xe2\x80\x99s Songs without Words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon when Ernest was left alone for half an hour or so with\r\nthe Dean he plied him so well with compliments that the old gentleman\r\nwas pleased and flattered beyond his wont. He rose and bowed. \xe2\x80\x9cThese\r\nexpressions,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, _voce su\xc3\xa2_, \xe2\x80\x9care very valuable to me.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThey are\r\nbut a small part, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Ernest, \xe2\x80\x9cof what anyone of your old\r\npupils must feel towards you,\xe2\x80\x9d and the pair danced as it were a minuet\r\nat the end of the dining-room table in front of the old bay window that\r\nlooked upon the smooth shaven lawn. On this Ernest departed; but a few\r\ndays afterwards, the Doctor wrote him a letter and told him that his\r\ncritics were a \xcf\x83\xce\xba\xce\xbb\xce\xb7\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xe1\xbd\xb6 \xce\xba\xce\xb1\xe1\xbd\xb6 \xe1\xbc\x80\xce\xbd\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb7\xcf\x84\xcf\x85\xcf\x80\xce\xbf\xce\xb9, and at the same time \xe1\xbc\x80\xce\xbd\xe1\xbd\xb3\xce\xba\xcf\x80\xce\xbb\xce\xb7\xce\xba\xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xce\xb9.\r\nErnest remembered \xcf\x83\xce\xba\xce\xbb\xce\xb7\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xe1\xbd\xb6, and knew that the other words were something\r\nof like nature, so it was all right. A month or two afterwards, Dr\r\nSkinner was gathered to his fathers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was an old fool, Ernest,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand you should not relent\r\ntowards him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could not help it,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9che was so old that it was almost\r\nlike playing with a child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSometimes, like all whose minds are active, Ernest overworks himself,\r\nand then occasionally he has fierce and reproachful encounters with Dr\r\nSkinner or Theobald in his sleep\xe2\x80\x94but beyond this neither of these two\r\nworthies can now molest him further.\r\n\r\nTo myself he has been a son and more than a son; at times I am half\r\nafraid\xe2\x80\x94as for example when I talk to him about his books\xe2\x80\x94that I may\r\nhave been to him more like a father than I ought; if I have, I trust he\r\nhas forgiven me. His books are the only bone of contention between us.\r\nI want him to write like other people, and not to offend so many of his\r\nreaders; he says he can no more change his manner of writing than the\r\ncolour of his hair, and that he must write as he does or not at all.\r\n\r\nWith the public generally he is not a favourite. He is admitted to have\r\ntalent, but it is considered generally to be of a queer unpractical\r\nkind, and no matter how serious he is, he is always accused of being in\r\njest. His first book was a success for reasons which I have already\r\nexplained, but none of his others have been more than creditable\r\nfailures. He is one of those unfortunate men, each one of whose books\r\nis sneered at by literary critics as soon as it comes out, but becomes\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cexcellent reading\xe2\x80\x9d as soon as it has been followed by a later work\r\nwhich may in its turn be condemned.\r\n\r\nHe never asked a reviewer to dinner in his life. I have told him over\r\nand over again that this is madness, and find that this is the only\r\nthing I can say to him which makes him angry with me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can it matter to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether people read my books or\r\nnot? It may matter to them\xe2\x80\x94but I have too much money to want more, and\r\nif the books have any stuff in them it will work by-and-by. I do not\r\nknow nor greatly care whether they are good or not. What opinion can\r\nany sane man form about his own work? Some people must write stupid\r\nbooks just as there must be junior ops and third class poll men. Why\r\nshould I complain of being among the mediocrities? If a man is not\r\nabsolutely below mediocrity let him be thankful\xe2\x80\x94besides, the books will\r\nhave to stand by themselves some day, so the sooner they begin the\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI spoke to his publisher about him not long since. \xe2\x80\x9cMr Pontifex,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cis a _homo unius libri_, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do to tell him so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could see the publisher, who ought to know, had lost all faith in\r\nErnest\xe2\x80\x99s literary position, and looked upon him as a man whose failure\r\nwas all the more hopeless for the fact of his having once made a\r\n_coup_. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is in a very solitary position, Mr Overton,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the\r\npublisher. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has formed no alliances, and has made enemies not only\r\nof the religious world but of the literary and scientific brotherhood\r\nas well. This will not do nowadays. If a man wishes to get on he must\r\nbelong to a set, and Mr Pontifex belongs to no set\xe2\x80\x94not even to a club.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI replied, \xe2\x80\x9cMr Pontifex is the exact likeness of Othello, but with a\r\ndifference\xe2\x80\x94he hates not wisely but too well. He would dislike the\r\nliterary and scientific swells if he were to come to know them and they\r\nhim; there is no natural solidarity between him and them, and if he\r\nwere brought into contact with them his last state would be worse than\r\nhis first. His instinct tells him this, so he keeps clear of them, and\r\nattacks them whenever he thinks they deserve it\xe2\x80\x94in the hope, perhaps,\r\nthat a younger generation will listen to him more willingly than the\r\npresent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan anything,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 said the publisher, \xe2\x80\x9cbe conceived more impracticable\r\nand imprudent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo all this Ernest replies with one word only\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch is my friend\xe2\x80\x99s latest development. He would not, it is true, run\r\nmuch chance at present of trying to found a College of Spiritual\r\nPathology, but I must leave the reader to determine whether there is\r\nnot a strong family likeness between the Ernest of the College of\r\nSpiritual Pathology and the Ernest who will insist on addressing the\r\nnext generation rather than his own. He says he trusts that there is\r\nnot, and takes the sacrament duly once a year as a sop to Nemesis lest\r\nhe should again feel strongly upon any subject. It rather fatigues him,\r\nbut \xe2\x80\x9cno man\xe2\x80\x99s opinions,\xe2\x80\x9d he sometimes says, \xe2\x80\x9ccan be worth holding\r\nunless he knows how to deny them easily and gracefully upon occasion in\r\nthe cause of charity.\xe2\x80\x9d In politics he is a Conservative so far as his\r\nvote and interest are concerned. In all other respects he is an\r\nadvanced Radical. His father and grandfather could probably no more\r\nunderstand his state of mind than they could understand Chinese, but\r\nthose who know him intimately do not know that they wish him greatly\r\ndifferent from what he actually is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WAY OF ALL FLESH ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 2084-0.txt or 2084-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/2/0/8/2084/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
