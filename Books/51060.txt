I had several reasons, however, for declining to do so,\r\nsome of which were of a nature altogether private, and concern no\r\nperson but myself; others not so much so. One consideration which\r\ndeterred me was, that, having kept no journal during a greater portion\r\nof the time in which I was absent, I feared I should not be able to\r\nwrite, from mere memory, a statement so minute and connected as to have\r\nthe _appearance_ of that truth it would really possess, barring only\r\nthe natural and unavoidable exaggeration to which all of us are prone\r\nwhen detailing events which have had powerful influence in exciting the\r\nimaginative faculties. Another reason was, that the incidents to be\r\nnarrated were of a nature so positively marvellous, that, unsupported\r\nas my assertions must necessarily be (except by the evidence of a\r\nsingle individual, and he a half-breed Indian), I could only hope for\r\nbelief among my family, and those of my friends who have had reason,\r\nthrough life, to put faith in my veracity--the probability being that\r\nthe public at large would regard what I should put forth as merely an\r\nimpudent and ingenious fiction. A distrust in my own abilities as a\r\nwriter was, nevertheless, one of the principal causes which prevented\r\nme from complying with the suggestions of my advisers.\r\n\r\nAmong those gentlemen in Virginia who expressed the greatest interest\r\nin my statement, more particularly in regard to that portion of it\r\nwhich related to the Antarctic Ocean, was Mr. Poe, lately editor of the\r\nSouthern Literary Messenger, a monthly magazine, published by Mr.\r\nThomas W. White, in the city of Richmond. He strongly advised me, among\r\nothers, to prepare at once a full account of what I had seen and\r\nundergone, and trust to the shrewdness and common sense of the\r\npublic--insisting, with great plausibility, that however roughly, as\r\nregards mere authorship, my book should be got up, its very\r\nuncouthness, if there were any, would give it all the better chance of\r\nbeing received as truth.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this representation, I did not make up my mind to do as\r\nhe suggested. He afterward proposed (finding that I would not stir in\r\nthe matter) that I should allow him to draw up, in his own words, a\r\nnarrative of the earlier portion of my adventures, from facts afforded\r\nby myself, publishing it in the Southern Messenger _under the garb of\r\nfiction_. To this, perceiving no objection, I consented, stipulating\r\nonly that my real name should be retained. Two numbers of the pretended\r\nfiction appeared, consequently, in the Messenger for January and\r\nFebruary (1837), and, in order that it might certainly be regarded as\r\nfiction, the name of Mr. Poe was affixed to the articles in the table\r\nof contents of the magazine.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which this _ruse_ was received has induced me at length\r\nto undertake a regular compilation and publication of the adventures in\r\nquestion; for I found that, in spite of the air of fable which had been\r\nso ingeniously thrown around that portion of my statement which\r\nappeared in the Messenger (without altering or distorting a single\r\nfact), the public were still not at all disposed to receive it as\r\nfable, and several letters were sent to Mr. P.\'s address distinctly\r\nexpressing a conviction to the contrary. I thence concluded that the\r\nfacts of my narrative would prove of such a nature as to carry with\r\nthem sufficient evidence of their own authenticity, and that I had\r\nconsequently little to fear on the score of popular incredulity.\r\n\r\nThis _expos\xe9_ being made, it will be seen at once how much of what\r\nfollows I claim to be my own writing; and it will also be understood\r\nthat no fact is misrepresented in the first few pages which were\r\nwritten by Mr. Poe. Even to those readers who have not seen the\r\nMessenger, it will be unnecessary to point out where his portion ends\r\nand my own commences; the difference in point of style will be readily\r\nperceived.\r\n\r\nA. G. PYM.\r\n\r\nNew-York, July, 1838.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE OF A. GORDON PYM.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy name is Arthur Gordon Pym. My father was a respectable trader in\r\nsea-stores at Nantucket, where I was born. My maternal grandfather was\r\nan attorney in good practice. He was fortunate in everything, and had\r\nspeculated very successfully in stocks of the Edgarton New-Bank, as it\r\nwas formerly called. By these and other means he had managed to lay by\r\na tolerable sum of money. He was more attached to myself, I believe,\r\nthan to any other person in the world, and I expected to inherit the\r\nmost of his property at his death. He sent me, at six years of age, to\r\nthe school of old Mr. Ricketts, a gentleman with only one arm, and of\r\neccentric manners--he is well known to almost every person who has\r\nvisited New Bedford. I stayed at his school until I was sixteen, when I\r\nleft him for Mr. E. Ronald\'s academy on the hill. Here I became\r\nintimate with the son of Mr. Barnard, a sea captain, who generally\r\nsailed in the employ of Lloyd and Vredenburgh--Mr. Barnard is also very\r\nwell known in New Bedford, and has many relations, I am certain, in\r\nEdgarton. His son was named Augustus, and he was nearly two years older\r\nthan myself. He had been on a whaling voyage with his father in the\r\nJohn Donaldson, and was always talking to me of his adventures in the\r\nSouth Pacific Ocean. I used frequently to go home with him, and remain\r\nall day, and sometimes all night. We occupied the same bed, and he\r\nwould be sure to keep me awake until almost light, telling me stories\r\nof the natives of the Island of Tinian, and other places he had visited\r\nin his travels. At last I could not help being interested in what he\r\nsaid, and by degrees I felt the greatest desire to go to sea. I owned a\r\nsail-boat called the Ariel, and worth about seventy-five dollars. She\r\nhad a half-deck or cuddy, and was rigged sloop-fashion--I forget her\r\ntonnage, but she would hold ten persons without much crowding. In this\r\nboat we were in the habit of going on some of the maddest freaks in the\r\nworld; and, when I now think of them, it appears to me a thousand\r\nwonders that I am alive to-day.\r\n\r\nI will relate one of these adventures by way of introduction to a\r\nlonger and more momentous narrative. One night there was a party at Mr.\r\nBarnard\'s, and both Augustus and myself were not a little intoxicated\r\ntowards the close of it. As usual, in such cases, I took part of his\r\nbed in preference to going home. He went to sleep, as I thought, very\r\nquietly (it being near one when the party broke up), and without saying\r\na word on his favourite topic. It might have been half an hour from the\r\ntime of our getting in bed, and I was just about falling into a doze,\r\nwhen he suddenly started up, and swore with a terrible oath that he\r\nwould not go to sleep for any Arthur Pym in Christendom, when there was\r\nso glorious a breeze from the southwest. I never was so astonished in\r\nmy life, not knowing what he intended, and thinking that the wines and\r\nliquors he had drunk had set him entirely beside himself. He proceeded\r\nto talk very coolly, however, saying he knew that I supposed him\r\nintoxicated, but that he was never more sober in his life. He was only\r\ntired, he added, of lying in bed on such a fine night like a dog, and\r\nwas determined to get up and dress, and go out on a frolic with the\r\nboat. I can hardly tell what possessed me, but the words were no sooner\r\nout of his mouth than I felt a thrill of the greatest excitement and\r\npleasure, and thought his mad idea one of the most delightful and most\r\nreasonable things in the world. It was blowing almost a gale, and the\r\nweather was very cold--it being late in October. I sprang out of bed,\r\nnevertheless, in a kind of ecstasy, and told him I was quite as brave\r\nas himself, and quite as tired as he was of lying in bed like a dog,\r\nand quite as ready for any fun or frolic as any Augustus Barnard in\r\nNantucket.\r\n\r\nWe lost no time in getting on our clothes and hurrying down to the\r\nboat. She was lying at the old decayed wharf by the lumber-yard of\r\nPankey & Co., and almost thumping her sides out against the rough logs.\r\nAugustus got into her and bailed her, for she was nearly half full of\r\nwater. This being done, we hoisted jib and mainsail, kept full, and\r\nstarted boldly out to sea.\r\n\r\nThe wind, as I before said, blew freshly from the southwest. The night\r\nwas very clear and cold. Augustus had taken the helm, and I stationed\r\nmyself by the mast, on the deck of the cuddy. We flew along at a great\r\nrate--neither of us having said a word since casting loose from the\r\nwharf. I now asked my companion what course he intended to steer, and\r\nwhat time he thought it probable we should get back. He whistled for a\r\nfew minutes, and then said crustily, "_I_ am going to sea--_you_ may go\r\nhome if you think proper." Turning my eyes upon him, I perceived at\r\nonce that, in spite of his assumed _nonchalance_, he was greatly\r\nagitated. I could see him distinctly by the light of the moon--his face\r\nwas paler than any marble, and his hand shook so excessively that he\r\ncould scarcely retain hold of the tiller. I found that something had\r\ngone wrong, and became seriously alarmed. At this period I knew little\r\nabout the management of a boat, and was now depending entirely upon the\r\nnautical skill of my friend. The wind, too, had suddenly increased, as\r\nwe were fast getting out of the lee of the land--still I was ashamed to\r\nbetray any trepidation, and for almost half an hour maintained a\r\nresolute silence. I could stand it no longer, however, and spoke to\r\nAugustus about the propriety of turning back. As before, it was nearly\r\na minute before he made answer, or took any notice of my suggestion.\r\n"By-and-by," said he at length--"time enough--home by-and-by." I had\r\nexpected a similar reply, but there was something in the tone of these\r\nwords which filled me with an indescribable feeling of dread. I again\r\nlooked at the speaker attentively. His lips were perfectly livid, and\r\nhis knees shook so violently together that he seemed scarcely able to\r\nstand. "For God\'s sake, Augustus," I screamed, now heartily frightened,\r\n"what ails you?--what is the matter?--what _are_ you going to do?"\r\n"Matter!" he stammered, in the greatest apparent surprise, letting go\r\nthe tiller at the same moment, and falling forward into the bottom of\r\nthe boat--"matter!--why, nothing is the--matter--going\r\nhome--d--d--don\'t you see?" The whole truth now flashed upon me. I flew\r\nto him and raised him up. He was drunk--beastly drunk--he could no\r\nlonger either stand, speak, or see. His eyes were perfectly glazed; and\r\nas I let him go in the extremity of my despair, he rolled like a mere\r\nlog into the bilge-water from which I had lifted him. It was evident\r\nthat, during the evening, he had drunk far more than I suspected, and\r\nthat his conduct in bed had been the result of a highly-concentrated\r\nstate of intoxication--a state which, like madness, frequently enables\r\nthe victim to imitate the outward demeanour of one in perfect\r\npossession of his senses. The coolness of the night air, however, had\r\nhad its usual effect--the mental energy began to yield before its\r\ninfluence--and the confused perception which he no doubt then had of\r\nhis perilous situation had assisted in hastening the catastrophe. He\r\nwas now thoroughly insensible, and there was no probability that he\r\nwould be otherwise for many hours.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly possible to conceive the extremity of my terror. The fumes\r\nof the wine lately taken had evaporated, leaving me doubly timid and\r\nirresolute. I knew that I was altogether incapable of managing the\r\nboat, and that a fierce wind and strong ebb tide were hurrying us to\r\ndestruction. A storm was evidently gathering behind us; we had neither\r\ncompass nor provisions; and it was clear that, if we held our present\r\ncourse, we should be out of sight of land before daybreak. These\r\nthoughts, with a crowd of others equally fearful, flashed through my\r\nmind with a bewildering rapidity, and for some moments paralyzed me\r\nbeyond the possibility of making any exertion. The boat was going\r\nthrough the water at a terrible rate--full before the wind--no reef in\r\neither jib or mainsail--running her bows completely under the foam. It\r\nwas a thousand wonders she did not broach to--Augustus having let go\r\nthe tiller, as I said before, and I being too much agitated to think of\r\ntaking it myself. By good luck, however, she kept steady, and gradually\r\nI recovered some degree of presence of mind. Still the wind was\r\nincreasing fearfully; and whenever we rose from a plunge forward, the\r\nsea behind fell combing over our counter, and deluged us with water. I\r\nwas so utterly benumbed, too, in every limb, as to be nearly\r\nunconscious of sensation. At length I summoned up the resolution of\r\ndespair, and rushing to the mainsail, let it go by the run. As might\r\nhave been expected, it flew over the bows, and, getting drenched with\r\nwater, carried away the mast short off by the board. This latter\r\naccident alone saved me from instant destruction. Under the jib only, I\r\nnow boomed along before the wind, shipping heavy seas occasionally over\r\nthe counter, but relieved from the terror of immediate death. I took\r\nthe helm, and breathed with greater freedom as I found that there yet\r\nremained to us a chance of ultimate escape. Augustus still lay\r\nsenseless in the bottom of the boat; and as there was imminent danger\r\nof his drowning (the water being nearly a foot deep just where he\r\nfell), I contrived to raise him partially up, and keep him in a sitting\r\nposition, by passing a rope round his waist, and lashing it to a\r\nringbolt in the deck of the cuddy. Having thus arranged everything as\r\nwell as I could in my chilled and agitated condition, I recommended\r\nmyself to God, and made up my mind to bear whatever might happen with\r\nall the fortitude in my power.\r\n\r\nHardly had I come to this resolution, when, suddenly, a loud and long\r\nscream or yell, as if from the throats of a thousand demons, seemed to\r\npervade the whole atmosphere around and above the boat. Never while I\r\nlive shall I forget the intense agony of terror I experienced at that\r\nmoment. My hair stood erect on my head--I felt the blood congealing in\r\nmy veins--my heart ceased utterly to beat, and without having once\r\nraised my eyes to learn the source of my alarm, I tumbled headlong and\r\ninsensible upon the body of my fallen companion.\r\n\r\nI found myself, upon reviving, in the cabin of a large whaling-ship\r\n(the Penguin) bound to Nantucket. Several persons were standing over\r\nme, and Augustus, paler than death, was busily occupied in chafing my\r\nhands. Upon seeing me open my eyes, his exclamations of gratitude and\r\njoy excited alternate laughter and tears from the rough-looking\r\npersonages who were present. The mystery of our being in existence was\r\nnow soon explained. We had been run down by the whaling-ship, which was\r\nclose hauled, beating up to Nantucket with every sail she could venture\r\nto set, and consequently running almost at right angles to our own\r\ncourse. Several men were on the look-out forward, but did not perceive\r\nour boat until it was an impossibility to avoid coming in\r\ncontact--their shouts of warning upon seeing us were what so terribly\r\nalarmed me. The huge ship, I was told, rode immediately over us with as\r\nmuch ease as our own little vessel would have passed over a feather,\r\nand without the least perceptible impediment to her progress. Not a\r\nscream arose from the deck of the victim--there was a slight grating\r\nsound to be heard mingling with the roar of wind and water, as the\r\nfrail bark which was swallowed up rubbed for a moment along the keel of\r\nher destroyer--but this was all. Thinking our boat (which it will be\r\nremembered was dismasted) some mere shell cut adrift as useless, the\r\ncaptain (Captain E. T. V. Block of New London) was for proceeding on\r\nhis course without troubling himself further about the matter. Luckily,\r\nthere were two of the look-out who swore positively to having seen some\r\nperson at our helm, and represented the possibility of yet saving him.\r\nA discussion ensued, when Block grew angry, and, after a while, said\r\nthat "it was no business of his to be eternally watching for\r\negg-shells; that the ship should _not_ put about for any such nonsense;\r\nand if there was a man run down, it was nobody\'s fault but his own--he\r\nmight drown and be d----d," or some language to that effect. Henderson,\r\nthe first mate, now took the matter up, being justly indignant, as well\r\nas the whole ship\'s crew, at a speech evincing so base a degree of\r\nheartless atrocity. He spoke plainly, seeing himself upheld by the men,\r\ntold the captain he considered him a fit subject for the gallows, and\r\nthat he would disobey his orders if he were hanged for it the moment he\r\nset his foot on shore. He strode aft, jostling Block (who turned very\r\npale and made no answer) on one side, and seizing the helm, gave the\r\nword, in a firm voice, _Hard-a-lee!_ The men flew to their posts, and\r\nthe ship went cleverly about. All this had occupied nearly five\r\nminutes, and it was supposed to be hardly within the bounds of\r\npossibility that any individual could be saved--allowing any to have\r\nbeen on board the boat. Yet, as the reader has seen, both Augustus and\r\nmyself were rescued; and our deliverance seemed to have been brought\r\nabout by two of those almost inconceivable pieces of good fortune which\r\nare attributed by the wise and pious to the special interference of\r\nProvidence.\r\n\r\nWhile the ship was yet in stays, the mate lowered the jolly-boat and\r\njumped into her with the very two men, I believe, who spoke up as\r\nhaving seen me at the helm. They had just left the lee of the vessel\r\n(the moon still shining brightly) when she made a long and heavy roll\r\nto windward, and Henderson, at the same moment, starting up in his\r\nseat, bawled out to his crew to _back water_. He would say nothing\r\nelse--repeating his cry impatiently, _back water! back water!_ The men\r\nput back as speedily as possible; but by this time the ship had gone\r\nround, and gotten fully under headway, although all hands on board were\r\nmaking great exertions to take in sail. In despite of the danger of the\r\nattempt, the mate clung to the main-chains as soon as they came within\r\nhis reach. Another huge lurch now brought the starboard side of the\r\nvessel out of water nearly as far as her keel, when the cause of his\r\nanxiety was rendered obvious enough. The body of a man was seen to be\r\naffixed in the most singular manner to the smooth and shining bottom\r\n(the Penguin was coppered and copper-fastened), and beating violently\r\nagainst it with every movement of the hull. After several ineffectual\r\nefforts, made during the lurches of the ship, and at the imminent risk\r\nof swamping the boat, I was finally disengaged from my perilous\r\nsituation and taken on board--for the body proved to be my own. It\r\nappeared that one of the timber-bolts having started and broken a\r\npassage through the copper, it had arrested my progress as I passed\r\nunder the ship, and fastened me in so extraordinary a manner to her\r\nbottom. The head of the bolt had made its way through the collar of the\r\ngreen baize jacket I had on, and through the back part of my neck,\r\nforcing itself out between two sinews and just below the right ear. I\r\nwas immediately put to bed--although life seemed to be totally extinct.\r\nThere was no surgeon on board. The captain, however, treated me with\r\nevery attention--to make amends, I presume, in the eyes of his crew,\r\nfor his atrocious behaviour in the previous portion of the adventure.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Henderson had again put off from the ship, although\r\nthe wind was now blowing almost a hurricane. He had not been gone many\r\nminutes when he fell in with some fragments of our boat, and shortly\r\nafterward one of the men with him asserted that he could distinguish a\r\ncry for help at intervals amid the roaring of the tempest. This induced\r\nthe hardy seamen to persevere in their search for more than half an\r\nhour, although repeated signals to return were made them by Captain\r\nBlock, and although every moment on the water in so frail a boat was\r\nfraught to them with the most imminent and deadly peril. Indeed, it is\r\nnearly impossible to conceive how the small jolly they were in could\r\nhave escaped destruction for a single instant. She was built, however,\r\nfor the whaling service, and was fitted, as I have since had reason to\r\nbelieve, with air-boxes, in the manner of some life-boats used on the\r\ncoast of Wales.\r\n\r\nAfter searching in vain for about the period of time just mentioned, it\r\nwas determined to get back to the ship. They had scarcely made this\r\nresolve when a feeble cry arose from a dark object which floated\r\nrapidly by. They pursued and soon overtook it. It proved to be the\r\nentire deck of the Ariel\'s cuddy. Augustus was struggling near it,\r\napparently in the last agonies. Upon getting hold of him it was found\r\nthat he was attached by a rope to the floating timber. This rope, it\r\nwill be remembered, I had myself tied round his waist, and made fast to\r\na ringbolt, for the purpose of keeping him in an upright position, and\r\nmy so doing, it appeared, had been ultimately the means of preserving\r\nhis life. The Ariel was slightly put together, and in going down her\r\nframe naturally went to pieces; the deck of the cuddy, as might be\r\nexpected, was lifted, by the force of the water rushing in, entirely\r\nfrom the main timbers, and floated (with other fragments, no doubt) to\r\nthe surface--Augustus was buoyed up with it, and thus escaped a\r\nterrible death.\r\n\r\nIt was more than an hour after being taken on board the Penguin before\r\nhe could give any account of himself, or be made to comprehend the\r\nnature of the accident which had befallen our boat. At length he became\r\nthoroughly aroused, and spoke much of his sensations while in the\r\nwater. Upon his first attaining any degree of consciousness, he found\r\nhimself beneath the surface, whirling round and round with\r\ninconceivable rapidity, and with a rope wrapped in three or four folds\r\ntightly about his neck. In an instant afterward he felt himself going\r\nrapidly upward, when, his head striking violently against a hard\r\nsubstance, he again relapsed into insensibility. Upon once more\r\nreviving he was in fuller possession of his reason--this was still,\r\nhowever, in the greatest degree clouded and confused. He now knew that\r\nsome accident had occurred, and that he was in the water, although his\r\nmouth was above the surface, and he could breathe with some freedom.\r\nPossibly, at this period, the deck was drifting rapidly before the\r\nwind, and drawing him after it, as he floated upon his back. Of course,\r\nas long as he could have retained this position, it would have been\r\nnearly impossible that he should be drowned. Presently a surge threw\r\nhim directly athwart the deck; and this post he endeavoured to\r\nmaintain, screaming at intervals for help. Just before he was\r\ndiscovered by Mr. Henderson, he had been obliged to relax his hold\r\nthrough exhaustion, and, falling into the sea, had given himself up for\r\nlost. During the whole period of his struggles he had not the faintest\r\nrecollection of the Ariel, nor of any matters in connexion with the\r\nsource of his disaster. A vague feeling of terror and despair had taken\r\nentire possession of his faculties. When he was finally picked up,\r\nevery power of his mind had failed him; and, as before said, it was\r\nnearly an hour after getting on board the Penguin before he became\r\nfully aware of his condition. In regard to myself--I was resuscitated\r\nfrom a state bordering very nearly upon death (and after every other\r\nmeans had been tried in vain for three hours and a half) by vigorous\r\nfriction with flannels bathed in hot oil--a proceeding suggested by\r\nAugustus. The wound in my neck, although of an ugly appearance, proved\r\nof little real consequence, and I soon recovered from its effects.\r\n\r\nThe Penguin got into port about nine o\'clock in the morning, after\r\nencountering one of the severest gales ever experienced off Nantucket.\r\nBoth Augustus and myself managed to appear at Mr. Barnard\'s in time for\r\nbreakfast--which, luckily, was somewhat late, owing to the party over\r\nnight. I suppose all at the table were too much fatigued themselves to\r\nnotice our jaded appearance--of course, it would not have borne a very\r\nrigid scrutiny. Schoolboys, however, can accomplish wonders in the way\r\nof deception, and I verily believe not one of our friends in Nantucket\r\nhad the slightest suspicion that the terrible story told by some\r\nsailors in town of their having run down a vessel at sea and drowned\r\nsome thirty or forty poor devils, had reference either to the Ariel, my\r\ncompanion, or myself. We two have since very frequently talked the\r\nmatter over--but never without a shudder. In one of our conversations\r\nAugustus frankly confessed to me, that in his whole life he had at no\r\ntime experienced so excruciating a sense of dismay, as when on board\r\nour little boat he first discovered the extent of his intoxication, and\r\nfelt himself sinking beneath its influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn no affairs of mere prejudice, pro or con, do we deduce inferences\r\nwith entire certainty even from the most simple data. It might be\r\nsupposed that a catastrophe such as I have just related would have\r\neffectually cooled my incipient passion for the sea. On the contrary, I\r\nnever experienced a more ardent longing for the wild adventures\r\nincident to the life of a navigator than within a week after our\r\nmiraculous deliverance. This short period proved amply long enough to\r\nerase from my memory the shadows, and bring out in vivid light all the\r\npleasurably exciting points of colour, all the picturesqueness of the\r\nlate perilous accident. My conversations with Augustus grew daily more\r\nfrequent and more intensely full of interest. He had a manner of\r\nrelating his stories of the ocean (more than one half of which I now\r\nsuspect to have been sheer fabrications) well adapted to have weight\r\nwith one of my enthusiastic temperament, and somewhat gloomy, although\r\nglowing imagination. It is strange, too, that he most strongly enlisted\r\nmy feelings in behalf of the life of a seaman, when he depicted his\r\nmore terrible moments of suffering and despair. For the bright side of\r\nthe painting I had a limited sympathy. My visions were of shipwreck and\r\nfamine; of death or captivity among barbarian hordes; of a lifetime\r\ndragged out in sorrow and tears, upon some gray and desolate rock, in\r\nan ocean unapproachable and unknown. Such visions or desires--for they\r\namounted to desires--are common, I have since been assured, to the\r\nwhole numerous race of the melancholy among men--at the time of which I\r\nspeak I regarded them only as prophetic glimpses of a destiny which I\r\nfelt myself in a measure bound to fulfil. Augustus thoroughly entered\r\ninto my state of mind. It is probable, indeed, that our intimate\r\ncommunion had resulted in a partial interchange of character.\r\n\r\nAbout eighteen months after the period of the Ariel\'s disaster, the\r\nfirm of Lloyd and Vredenburgh (a house connected in some manner with\r\nthe Messieurs Enderby, I believe, of Liverpool) were engaged in\r\nrepairing and fitting out the brig Grampus for a whaling voyage. She\r\nwas an old hulk, and scarcely seaworthy when all was done to her that\r\ncould be done. I hardly know why she was chosen in preference to other\r\ngood vessels belonging to the same owners--but so it was. Mr. Barnard\r\nwas appointed to command her, and Augustus was going with him. While\r\nthe brig was getting ready, he frequently urged upon me the excellency\r\nof the opportunity now offered for indulging my desire of travel. He\r\nfound me by no means an unwilling listener--yet the matter could not be\r\nso easily arranged. My father made no direct opposition; but my mother\r\nwent into hysterics at the bare mention of the design; and, more than\r\nall, my grandfather, from whom I expected much, vowed to cut me off\r\nwith a shilling if I should ever broach the subject to him again. These\r\ndifficulties, however, so far from abating my desire, only added fuel\r\nto the flame. I determined to go at all hazards; and, having made known\r\nmy intention to Augustus, we set about arranging a plan by which it\r\nmight be accomplished. In the meantime I forbore speaking to any of my\r\nrelations in regard to the voyage, and, as I busied myself ostensibly\r\nwith my usual studies, it was supposed that I had abandoned the design.\r\nI have since frequently examined my conduct on this occasion with\r\nsentiments of displeasure as well as of surprise. The intense hypocrisy\r\nI made use of for the furtherance of my project--an hypocrisy pervading\r\nevery word and action of my life for so long a period of time--could\r\nonly have been rendered tolerable to myself by the wild and burning\r\nexpectation with which I looked forward to the fulfilment of my\r\nlong-cherished visions of travel.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of my scheme of deception, I was necessarily obliged to\r\nleave much to the management of Augustus, who was employed for the\r\ngreater part of every day on board the Grampus, attending to some\r\narrangements for his father in the cabin and cabin hold. At night,\r\nhowever, we were sure to have a conference, and talk over our hopes.\r\nAfter nearly a month passed in this manner, without our hitting upon\r\nany plan we thought likely to succeed, he told me at last that he had\r\ndetermined upon everything necessary. I had a relation living in New\r\nBedford, a Mr. Ross, at whose house I was in the habit of spending\r\noccasionally two or three weeks at a time. The brig was to sail about\r\nthe middle of June (June, 1827), and it was agreed that, a day or two\r\nbefore her putting to sea, my father was to receive a note, as usual,\r\nfrom Mr. Ross, asking me to come over and spend a fortnight with Robert\r\nand Emmet (his sons). Augustus charged himself with the enditing of\r\nthis note and getting it delivered. Having set out, as supposed, for\r\nNew Bedford, I was then to report myself to my companion, who would\r\ncontrive a hiding-place for me in the Grampus. This hiding-place, he\r\nassured me, would be rendered sufficiently comfortable for a residence\r\nof many days, during which I was not to make my appearance. When the\r\nbrig had proceeded so far on her course as to make any turning back a\r\nmatter out of question, I should then, he said, be formally installed\r\nin all the comforts of the cabin; and as to his father, he would only\r\nlaugh heartily at the joke. Vessels enough would be met with by which a\r\nletter might be sent home explaining the adventure to my parents.\r\n\r\nThe middle of June at length arrived, and everything had been matured.\r\nThe note was written and delivered, and on a Monday morning I left the\r\nhouse for the New Bedford packet, as supposed. I went, however,\r\nstraight to Augustus, who was waiting for me at the corner of a street.\r\nIt had been our original plan that I should keep out of the way until\r\ndark, and then slip on board the brig; but, as there was now a thick\r\nfog in our favour, it was agreed to lose no time in secreting me.\r\nAugustus led the way to the wharf, and I followed at a little distance,\r\nenveloped in a thick seaman\'s cloak, which he had brought with him, so\r\nthat my person might not be easily recognised. Just as we turned the\r\nsecond corner, after passing Mr. Edmund\'s well, who should appear,\r\nstanding right in front of me, and looking me full in the face, but old\r\nMr. Peterson, my grandfather. "Why, bless my soul, Gordon," said he,\r\nafter a long pause, "why, why--_whose_ dirty cloak is that you have\r\non?" "Sir!" I replied, assuming, as well as I could, in the exigency of\r\nthe moment, an air of offended surprise, and talking in the gruffest of\r\nall imaginable tones--"sir! you are a sum\'mat mistaken--my name, in the\r\nfirst place, bee\'nt nothing at all like Goddin, and I\'d want you for to\r\nknow better, you blackguard, than to call my new obercoat a darty one!"\r\nFor my life I could hardly refrain from screaming with laughter at the\r\nodd manner in which the old gentleman received this handsome rebuke. He\r\nstarted back two or three steps, turned first pale and then excessively\r\nred, threw up his spectacles, then, putting them down, ran full tilt at\r\nme, with his umbrella uplifted. He stopped short, however, in his\r\ncareer, as if struck with a sudden recollection; and presently, turning\r\nround, hobbled off down the street, shaking all the while with rage,\r\nand muttering between his teeth, "Won\'t do--new glasses--thought it was\r\nGordon--d----d good-for-nothing salt water Long Tom."\r\n\r\nAfter this narrow escape we proceeded with greater caution, and arrived\r\nat our point of destination in safety. There were only one or two of\r\nthe hands on board, and these were busy forward, doing something to the\r\nforecastle combings. Captain Barnard, we knew very well, was engaged at\r\nLloyd and Vredenburgh\'s, and would remain there until late in the\r\nevening, so we had little to apprehend on his account. Augustus went\r\nfirst up the vessel\'s side, and in a short while I followed him,\r\nwithout being noticed by the men at work. We proceeded at once into the\r\ncabin, and found no person there. It was fitted up in the most\r\ncomfortable style--a thing somewhat unusual in a whaling-vessel. There\r\nwere four very excellent staterooms, with wide and convenient berths.\r\nThere was also a large stove, I took notice, and a remarkably thick and\r\nvaluable carpet covering the floor of both the cabin and staterooms.\r\nThe ceiling was full seven feet high, and, in short, everything\r\nappeared of a more roomy and agreeable nature than I had anticipated.\r\nAugustus, however, would allow me but little time for observation,\r\ninsisting upon the necessity of my concealing myself as soon as\r\npossible. He led the way into his own stateroom, which was on the\r\nstarboard side of the brig, and next to the bulkheads. Upon entering,\r\nhe closed the door and bolted it. I thought I had never seen a nicer\r\nlittle room than the one in which I now found myself. It was about ten\r\nfeet long, and had only one berth, which, as I said before, was wide\r\nand convenient. In that portion of the closet nearest the bulkheads\r\nthere was a space of four feet square, containing a table, a chair, and\r\na set of hanging shelves full of books, chiefly books of voyages and\r\ntravels. There were many other little comforts in the room, among which\r\nI ought not to forget a kind of safe or refrigerator, in which Augustus\r\npointed out to me a host of delicacies, both in the eating and drinking\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nHe now pressed with his knuckles upon a certain spot of the carpet in\r\none corner of the space just mentioned, letting me know that a portion\r\nof the flooring, about sixteen inches square, had been neatly cut out\r\nand again adjusted. As he pressed, this portion rose up at one end\r\nsufficiently to allow the passage of his finger beneath. In this manner\r\nhe raised the mouth of the trap (to which the carpet was still fastened\r\nby tacks), and I found that it led into the after hold. He next lit a\r\nsmall taper by means of a phosphorus match, and, placing the light in a\r\ndark lantern, descended with it through the opening, bidding me follow.\r\nI did so, and he then pulled the cover upon the hole, by means of a\r\nnail driven into the under side--the carpet, of course, resuming its\r\noriginal position on the floor of the stateroom, and all traces of the\r\naperture being concealed.\r\n\r\nThe taper gave out so feeble a ray, that it was with the greatest\r\ndifficulty I could grope my way through the confused mass of lumber\r\namong which I now found myself. By degrees, however, my eyes became\r\naccustomed to the gloom, and I proceeded with less trouble, holding on\r\nto the skirts of my friend\'s coat. He brought me, at length, after\r\ncreeping and winding through innumerable narrow passages, to an\r\niron-bound box, such as is used sometimes for packing fine earthenware.\r\nIt was nearly four feet high, and full six long, but very narrow. Two\r\nlarge empty oil-casks lay on the top of it, and above these, again, a\r\nvast quantity of straw matting, piled up as high as the floor of the\r\ncabin. In every other direction around was wedged as closely as\r\npossible, even up to the ceiling, a complete chaos of almost every\r\nspecies of ship-furniture, together with a heterogeneous medley of\r\ncrates, hampers, barrels, and bales, so that it seemed a matter no less\r\nthan miraculous that we had discovered any passage at all to the box. I\r\nafterward found that Augustus had purposely arranged the stowage in\r\nthis hold with a view to affording me a thorough concealment, having\r\nhad only one assistant in the labour, a man not going out in the brig.\r\n\r\nMy companion now showed me that one of the ends of the box could be\r\nremoved at pleasure. He slipped it aside and displayed the interior, at\r\nwhich I was excessively amused. A mattress from one of the cabin berths\r\ncovered the whole of its bottom, and it contained almost every article\r\nof mere comfort which could be crowded into so small a space, allowing\r\nme, at the same time, sufficient room for my accommodation, either in a\r\nsitting position or lying at full length. Among other things, there\r\nwere some books, pen, ink, and paper, three blankets, a large jug full\r\nof water, a keg of sea-biscuit, three or four immense Bologna sausages,\r\nan enormous ham, a cold leg of roast mutton, and half a dozen bottles\r\nof cordials and liqueurs. I proceeded immediately to take possession of\r\nmy little apartment, and this with feelings of higher satisfaction, I\r\nam sure, than any monarch ever experienced upon entering a new palace.\r\nAugustus now pointed out to me the method of fastening the open end of\r\nthe box, and then, holding the taper close to the deck, showed me a\r\npiece of dark whipcord lying along it. This, he said, extended from my\r\nhiding-place throughout all the necessary windings among the lumber, to\r\na nail which was driven into the deck of the hold, immediately beneath\r\nthe trapdoor leading into his stateroom. By means of this cord I should\r\nbe enabled readily to trace my way out without his guidance, provided\r\nany unlooked-for accident should render such a step necessary. He now\r\ntook his departure, leaving with me the lantern, together with a\r\ncopious supply of tapers and phosphorus, and promising to pay me a\r\nvisit as often as he could contrive to do so without observation. This\r\nwas on the seventeenth of June.\r\n\r\nI remained three days and nights (as nearly as I could guess) in my\r\nhiding-place without getting out of it at all, except twice for the\r\npurpose of stretching my limbs by standing erect between two crates\r\njust opposite the opening. During the whole period I saw nothing of\r\nAugustus; but this occasioned me little uneasiness, as I knew the brig\r\nwas expected to put to sea every hour, and in the bustle he would not\r\neasily find opportunities of coming down to me. At length I heard the\r\ntrap open and shut, and presently he called in a low voice, asking if\r\nall was well, and if there was anything I wanted. "Nothing," I replied;\r\n"I am as comfortable as can be; when will the brig sail?" "She will be\r\nunder weigh in less than half an hour," he answered. "I came to let you\r\nknow, and for fear you should be uneasy at my absence. I shall not have\r\na chance of coming down again for some time--perhaps for three or four\r\ndays more. All is going on right aboveboard. After I go up and close\r\nthe trap, do you creep along by the whipcord to where the nail is\r\ndriven in. You will find my watch there--it may be useful to you, as\r\nyou have no daylight to keep time by. I suppose you can\'t tell how long\r\nyou have been buried--only three days--this is the twentieth. I would\r\nbring the watch to your box, but am afraid of being missed." With this\r\nhe went up.\r\n\r\nIn about an hour after he had gone I distinctly felt the brig in\r\nmotion, and congratulated myself upon having at length fairly commenced\r\na voyage. Satisfied with this idea, I determined to make my mind as\r\neasy as possible, and await the course of events until I should be\r\npermitted to exchange the box for the more roomy, although hardly more\r\ncomfortable, accommodations of the cabin. My first care was to get the\r\nwatch. Leaving the taper burning, I groped along in the dark, following\r\nthe cord through windings innumerable, in some of which I discovered\r\nthat, after toiling a long distance, I was brought back within a foot\r\nor two of a former position. At length I reached the nail, and,\r\nsecuring the object of my journey, returned with it in safety. I now\r\nlooked over the books which had been so thoughtfully provided, and\r\nselected the expedition of Lewis and Clarke to the mouth of the\r\nColumbia. With this I amused myself for some time, when, growing\r\nsleepy, I extinguished the light with great care, and soon fell into a\r\nsound slumber.\r\n\r\nUpon awaking I felt strangely confused in mind, and some time elapsed\r\nbefore I could bring to recollection all the various circumstances of\r\nmy situation. By degrees, however, I remembered all. Striking a light,\r\nI looked at the watch; but it was run down, and there were,\r\nconsequently, no means of determining how long I had slept. My limbs\r\nwere greatly cramped, and I was forced to relieve them by standing\r\nbetween the crates. Presently, feeling an almost ravenous appetite, I\r\nbethought myself of the cold mutton, some of which I had eaten just\r\nbefore going to sleep, and found excellent. What was my astonishment at\r\ndiscovering it to be in a state of absolute putrefaction! This\r\ncircumstance occasioned me great disquietude; for, connecting it with\r\nthe disorder of mind I experienced upon awaking, I began to suppose\r\nthat I must have slept for an inordinately long period of time. The\r\nclose atmosphere of the hold might have had something to do with this,\r\nand might, in the end, be productive of the most serious results. My\r\nhead ached excessively; I fancied that I drew every breath with\r\ndifficulty; and, in short, I was oppressed with a multitude of gloomy\r\nfeelings. Still I could not venture to make any disturbance by opening\r\nthe trap or otherwise, and, having wound up the watch, contented myself\r\nas well as possible.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole of the next tedious twenty-four hours no person\r\ncame to my relief, and I could not help accusing Augustus of the\r\ngrossest inattention. What alarmed me chiefly was, that the water in my\r\njug was reduced to about half a pint, and I was suffering much from\r\nthirst, having eaten freely of the Bologna sausages after the loss of\r\nmy mutton. I became very uneasy, and could no longer take any interest\r\nin my books. I was overpowered, too, with a desire to sleep, yet\r\ntrembled at the thought of indulging it, lest there might exist some\r\npernicious influence, like that of burning charcoal, in the confined\r\nair of the hold. In the mean time the roll of the brig told me that we\r\nwere far in the main ocean, and a dull humming sound, which reached my\r\nears as if from an immense distance, convinced me no ordinary gale was\r\nblowing. I could not imagine a reason for the absence of Augustus. We\r\nwere surely far enough advanced on our voyage to allow of my going up.\r\nSome accident might have happened to him--but I could think of none\r\nwhich would account for his suffering me to remain so long a prisoner,\r\nexcept, indeed, his having suddenly died or fallen overboard, and upon\r\nthis idea I could not dwell with any degree of patience. It was\r\npossible that we had been baffled by head winds, and were still in the\r\nnear vicinity of Nantucket. This notion, however, I was forced to\r\nabandon; for, such being the case, the brig must have frequently gone\r\nabout; and I was entirely satisfied, from her continual inclination to\r\nthe larboard, that she had been sailing all along with a steady breeze\r\non her starboard quarter. Besides, granting that we were still in the\r\nneighbourhood of the island, why should not Augustus have visited me\r\nand informed me of the circumstance? Pondering in this manner upon the\r\ndifficulties of my solitary and cheerless condition, I resolved to wait\r\nyet another twenty-four hours, when, if no relief were obtained, I\r\nwould make my way to the trap, and endeavour either to hold a parley\r\nwith my friend, or get at least a little fresh air through the opening,\r\nand a further supply of water from his stateroom. While occupied with\r\nthis thought, however, I fell, in spite of every exertion to the\r\ncontrary, into a state of profound sleep, or rather stupor. My dreams\r\nwere of the most terrific description. Every species of calamity and\r\nhorror befell me. Among other miseries, I was smothered to death\r\nbetween huge pillows, by demons of the most ghastly and ferocious\r\naspect. Immense serpents held me in their embrace, and looked earnestly\r\nin my face with their fearfully shining eyes. Then deserts, limitless,\r\nand of the most forlorn and awe-inspiring character, spread themselves\r\nout before me. Immensely tall trunks of trees, gray and leafless, rose\r\nup in endless succession as far as the eye could reach. Their roots\r\nwere concealed in wide-spreading morasses, whose dreary water lay\r\nintensely black, still, and altogether terrible, beneath. And the\r\nstrange trees seemed endowed with a human vitality, and, waving to and\r\nfro their skeleton arms, were crying to the silent waters for mercy, in\r\nthe shrill and piercing accents of the most acute agony and despair.\r\nThe scene changed; and I stood, naked and alone, amid the burning\r\nsand-plains of Zahara. At my feet lay crouched a fierce lion of the\r\ntropics. Suddenly his wild eyes opened and fell upon me. With a\r\nconvulsive bound he sprang to his feet, and laid bare his horrible\r\nteeth. In another instant there burst from his red throat a roar like\r\nthe thunder of the firmament, and I fell impetuously to the earth.\r\nStifling in a paroxysm of terror, I at last found myself partially\r\nawake. My dream, then, was not all a dream. Now, at least, I was in\r\npossession of my senses. The paws of some huge and real monster were\r\npressing heavily upon my bosom--his hot breath was in my ear--and his\r\nwhite and ghastly fangs were gleaming upon me through the gloom.\r\n\r\nHad a thousand lives hung upon the movement of a limb or the utterance\r\nof a syllable, I could have neither stirred nor spoken. The beast,\r\nwhatever it was, retained his position without attempting any immediate\r\nviolence, while I lay in an utterly helpless, and, I fancied, a dying\r\ncondition beneath him. I felt that my powers of body and mind were fast\r\nleaving me--in a word, that I was perishing, and perishing of sheer\r\nfright. My brain swam--I grew deadly sick--my vision failed--even the\r\nglaring eyeballs above me grew dim. Making a last strong effort, I at\r\nlength breathed a faint ejaculation to God, and resigned myself to die.\r\nThe sound of my voice seemed to arouse all the latent fury of the\r\nanimal. He precipitated himself at full length upon my body; but what\r\nwas my astonishment, when, with a long and low whine, he commenced\r\nlicking my face and hands with the greatest eagerness, and with the\r\nmost extravagant demonstrations of affection and joy! I was bewildered,\r\nutterly lost in amazement--but I could not forget the peculiar whine of\r\nmy Newfoundland dog Tiger, and the odd manner of his caresses I well\r\nknew. It was he. I experienced a sudden rush of blood to my temples--a\r\ngiddy and overpowering sense of deliverance and reanimation. I rose\r\nhurriedly from the mattress upon which I had been lying, and, throwing\r\nmyself upon the neck of my faithful follower and friend, relieved the\r\nlong oppression of my bosom in a flood of the most passionate tears.\r\n\r\nAs upon a former occasion, my conceptions were in a state of the\r\ngreatest indistinctness and confusion after leaving the mattress. For a\r\nlong time I found it nearly impossible to connect any ideas--but, by\r\nvery slow degrees, my thinking faculties returned, and I again called\r\nto memory the several incidents of my condition. For the presence of\r\nTiger I tried in vain to account; and after busying myself with a\r\nthousand different conjectures respecting him, was forced to content\r\nmyself with rejoicing that he was with me to share my dreary solitude,\r\nand render me comfort by his caresses. Most people love their dogs--but\r\nfor Tiger I had an affection far more ardent than common; and never,\r\ncertainly, did any creature more truly deserve it. For seven years he\r\nhad been my inseparable companion, and in a multitude of instances had\r\ngiven evidence of all the noble qualities for which we value the\r\nanimal. I had rescued him, when a puppy, from the clutches of a\r\nmalignant little villain in Nantucket, who was leading him, with a rope\r\naround his neck, to the water; and the grown dog repaid the obligation,\r\nabout three years afterward, by saving me from the bludgeon of a\r\nstreet-robber.\r\n\r\nGetting now hold of the watch, I found, upon applying it to my ear,\r\nthat it had again run down; but at this I was not at all surprised,\r\nbeing convinced, from the peculiar state of my feelings, that I had\r\nslept, as before, for a very long period of time; how long, it was of\r\ncourse impossible to say. I was burning up with fever, and my thirst\r\nwas almost intolerable. I felt about the box for my little remaining\r\nsupply of water; for I had no light, the taper having burnt to the\r\nsocket of the lantern, and the phosphorus-box not coming readily to\r\nhand. Upon finding the jug, however, I discovered it to be\r\nempty--Tiger, no doubt, having been tempted to drink it, as well as to\r\ndevour the remnant of mutton, the bone of which lay, well picked, by\r\nthe opening of the box. The spoiled meat I could well spare, but my\r\nheart sank as I thought of the water. I was feeble in the extreme--so\r\nmuch so that I shook all over, as with an ague, at the slightest\r\nmovement or exertion. To add to my troubles, the brig was pitching and\r\nrolling with great violence, and the oil-casks which lay upon my box\r\nwere in momentary danger of falling down, so as to block up the only\r\nway of ingress or egress. I felt, also, terrible sufferings from\r\nsea-sickness. These considerations determined me to make my way, at all\r\nhazards, to the trap, and obtain immediate relief, before I should be\r\nincapacitated from doing so altogether. Having come to this resolve, I\r\nagain felt about for the phosphorus-box and tapers. The former I found\r\nafter some little trouble; but, not discovering the tapers as soon as I\r\nhad expected (for I remembered very nearly the spot in which I had\r\nplaced them), I gave up the search for the present, and bidding Tiger\r\nlie quiet, began at once my journey towards the trap.\r\n\r\nIn this attempt my great feebleness became more than ever apparent. It\r\nwas with the utmost difficulty I could crawl along at all, and very\r\nfrequently my limbs sank suddenly from beneath me; when, falling\r\nprostrate on my face, I would remain for some minutes in a state\r\nbordering on insensibility. Still I struggled forward by slow degrees,\r\ndreading every moment that I should swoon amid the narrow and intricate\r\nwindings of the lumber, in which event I had nothing but death to\r\nexpect as the result. At length, upon making a push forward with all\r\nthe energy I could command, I struck my forehead violently against the\r\nsharp corner of an iron-bound crate. The accident only stunned me for a\r\nfew moments; but I found, to my inexpressible grief, that the quick and\r\nviolent roll of the vessel had thrown the crate entirely across my\r\npath, so as effectually to block up the passage. With my utmost\r\nexertions I could not move it a single inch from its position, it being\r\nclosely wedged in among the surrounding boxes and ship-furniture. It\r\nbecame necessary, therefore, enfeebled as I was, either to leave the\r\nguidance of the whipcord and seek out a new passage, or to climb over\r\nthe obstacle, and resume the path on the other side. The former\r\nalternative presented too many difficulties and dangers to be thought\r\nof without a shudder. In my present weak state of both mind and body, I\r\nshould infallibly lose my way if I attempted it, and perish miserably\r\namid the dismal and disgusting labyrinths of the hold. I proceeded,\r\ntherefore, without hesitation, to summon up all my remaining strength\r\nand fortitude, and endeavour, as I best might, to clamber over the\r\ncrate.\r\n\r\nUpon standing erect, with this end in view, I found the undertaking\r\neven a more serious task than my fears had led me to imagine. On each\r\nside of the narrow passage arose a complete wall of various heavy\r\nlumber, which the least blunder on my part might be the means of\r\nbringing down upon my head; or, if this accident did not occur, the\r\npath might be effectually blocked up against my return by the\r\ndescending mass, as it was in front by the obstacle there. The crate\r\nitself was a long and unwieldy box, upon which no foothold could be\r\nobtained. In vain I attempted, by every means in my power, to reach the\r\ntop, with the hope of being thus enabled to draw myself up. Had I\r\nsucceeded in reaching it, it is certain that my strength would have\r\nproved utterly inadequate to the task of getting over, and it was\r\nbetter in every respect that I failed. At length, in a desperate effort\r\nto force the crate from its ground, I felt a strong vibration in the\r\nside next me. I thrust my hand eagerly to the edge of the planks, and\r\nfound that a very large one was loose. With my pocket-knife, which\r\nluckily I had with me, I succeeded, after great labour, in prying it\r\nentirely off; and, getting through the aperture, discovered, to my\r\nexceeding joy, that there were no boards on the opposite side--in other\r\nwords, that the top was wanting, it being the bottom through which I\r\nhad forced my way. I now met with no important difficulty in proceeding\r\nalong the line until I finally reached the nail. With a beating heart I\r\nstood erect, and with a gentle touch pressed against the cover of the\r\ntrap. It did not rise as soon as I had expected, and I pressed it with\r\nsomewhat more determination, still dreading lest some other person than\r\nAugustus might be in his stateroom. The door, however, to my\r\nastonishment, remained steady, and I became somewhat uneasy, for I knew\r\nthat it had formerly required little or no effort to remove it. I\r\npushed it strongly--it was nevertheless firm: with all my strength--it\r\nstill did not give way: with rage, with fury, with despair--it set at\r\ndefiance my utmost efforts; and it was evident, from the unyielding\r\nnature of the resistance, that the hole had either been discovered and\r\neffectually nailed up, or that some immense weight had been placed upon\r\nit, which it was useless to think of removing.\r\n\r\nMy sensations were those of extreme horror and dismay. In vain I\r\nattempted to reason on the probable cause of my being thus entombed. I\r\ncould summon up no connected chain of reflection, and, sinking on the\r\nfloor, gave way, unresistingly, to the most gloomy imaginings, in which\r\nthe dreadful deaths of thirst, famine, suffocation, and premature\r\ninterment, crowded upon me as the prominent disasters to be\r\nencountered. At length there returned to me some portion of presence of\r\nmind. I arose, and felt with my fingers for the seams or cracks of the\r\naperture. Having found them, I examined them closely to ascertain if\r\nthey emitted any light from the stateroom; but none was visible. I then\r\nforced the penblade of my knife through them, until I met with some\r\nhard obstacle. Scraping against it, I discovered it to be a solid mass\r\nof iron, which, from its peculiar wavy feel as I passed the blade along\r\nit, I concluded to be a chain-cable. The only course now left me was to\r\nretrace my way to the box, and there either yield to my sad fate, or\r\ntry so to tranquillize my mind as to admit of my arranging some plan of\r\nescape. I immediately set about the attempt, and succeeded, after\r\ninnumerable difficulties, in getting back. As I sank, utterly\r\nexhausted, upon the mattress, Tiger threw himself at full length by my\r\nside, and seemed as if desirous, by his caresses, of consoling me in my\r\ntroubles, and urging me to bear them with fortitude.\r\n\r\nThe singularity of his behaviour at length forcibly arrested my\r\nattention. After licking my face and hands for some minutes, he would\r\nsuddenly cease doing so, and utter a low whine. Upon reaching out my\r\nhand towards him, I then invariably found him lying on his back, with\r\nhis paws uplifted. This conduct, so frequently repeated, appeared\r\nstrange, and I could in no manner account for it. As the dog seemed\r\ndistressed, I concluded that he had received some injury; and, taking\r\nhis paws in my hands, I examined them one by one, but found no sign of\r\nany hurt. I then supposed him hungry, and gave him a large piece of\r\nham, which he devoured with avidity--afterward, however, resuming his\r\nextraordinary manoeuvres. I now imagined that he was suffering, like\r\nmyself, the torments of thirst, and was about adopting this conclusion\r\nas the true one, when the idea occurred to me that I had as yet only\r\nexamined his paws, and that there might possibly be a wound upon some\r\nportion of his body or head. The latter I felt carefully over, but\r\nfound nothing. On passing my hand, however, along his back, I perceived\r\na slight erection of the hair extending completely across it. Probing\r\nthis with my finger, I discovered a string, and, tracing it up, found\r\nthat it encircled the whole body. Upon a closer scrutiny, I came across\r\na small slip of what had the feeling of letter paper, through which the\r\nstring had been fastened in such a manner as to bring it immediately\r\nbeneath the left shoulder of the animal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thought instantly occurred to me that the paper was a note from\r\nAugustus, and that some unaccountable accident having happened to\r\nprevent his relieving me from my dungeon, he had devised this method of\r\nacquainting me with the true state of affairs. Trembling with\r\neagerness, I now commenced another search for my phosphorus matches and\r\ntapers. I had a confused recollection of having put them carefully away\r\njust before falling asleep; and, indeed, previously to my last journey\r\nto the trap, I had been able to remember the exact spot where I had\r\ndeposited them. But now I endeavoured in vain to call it to mind, and\r\nbusied myself for a full hour in a fruitless and vexatious search for\r\nthe missing articles; never, surely, was there a more tantalizing state\r\nof anxiety and suspense. At length, while groping about, with my head\r\nclose to the ballast, near the opening of the box, and outside of it, I\r\nperceived a faint glimmering of light in the direction of the steerage.\r\nGreatly surprised, I endeavoured to make my way towards it, as it\r\nappeared to be but a few feet from my position. Scarcely had I moved\r\nwith this intention, when I lost sight of the glimmer entirely, and,\r\nbefore I could bring it into view again, was obliged to feel along by\r\nthe box until I had exactly resumed my original situation. Now, moving\r\nmy head with caution to and fro, I found that, by proceeding slowly,\r\nwith great care, in an opposite direction to that in which I had at\r\nfirst started, I was enabled to draw near the light, still keeping it\r\nin view. Presently I came directly upon it (having squeezed my way\r\nthrough innumerable narrow windings), and found that it proceeded from\r\nsome fragments of my matches lying in an empty barrel turned upon its\r\nside. I was wondering how they came in such a place, when my hand fell\r\nupon two or three pieces of taper-wax, which had been evidently mumbled\r\nby the dog. I concluded at once that he had devoured the whole of my\r\nsupply of candles, and I felt hopeless of being ever able to read the\r\nnote of Augustus. The small remnants of the wax were so mashed up among\r\nother rubbish in the barrel, that I despaired of deriving any service\r\nfrom them, and left them as they were. The phosphorus, of which there\r\nwas only a speck or two, I gathered up as well as I could, and returned\r\nwith it, after much difficulty, to my box, where Tiger had all the\r\nwhile remained.\r\n\r\nWhat to do next I could not tell. The hold was so intensely dark that I\r\ncould not see my hand, however close I would hold it to my face. The\r\nwhite slip of paper could barely be discerned, and not even that when I\r\nlooked at it directly; by turning the exterior portions of the retina\r\ntowards it, that is to say, by surveying it slightly askance, I found\r\nthat it became in some measure perceptible. Thus the gloom of my prison\r\nmay be imagined, and the note of my friend, if indeed it were a note\r\nfrom him, seemed only likely to throw me into further trouble, by\r\ndisquieting to no purpose my already enfeebled and agitated mind. In\r\nvain I revolved in my brain a multitude of absurd expedients for\r\nprocuring light--such expedients precisely as a man in the perturbed\r\nsleep occasioned by opium would be apt to fall upon for a similar\r\npurpose--each and all of which appear by turns to the dreamer the most\r\nreasonable and the most preposterous of conceptions, just as the\r\nreasoning or imaginative faculties flicker, alternately, one above the\r\nother. At last an idea occurred to me which seemed rational, and which\r\ngave me cause to wonder, very justly, that I had not entertained it\r\nbefore. I placed the slip of paper on the back of a book, and,\r\ncollecting the fragments of the phosphorus matches which I had brought\r\nfrom the barrel, laid them together upon the paper. I then, with the\r\npalm of my hand, rubbed the whole over quickly yet steadily. A clear\r\nlight diffused itself immediately throughout the whole surface; and had\r\nthere been any writing upon it, I should not have experienced the least\r\ndifficulty, I am sure, in reading it. Not a syllable was there,\r\nhowever--nothing but a dreary and unsatisfactory blank; the\r\nillumination died away in a few seconds, and my heart died away within\r\nme as it went.\r\n\r\nI have before stated more than once that my intellect, for some period\r\nprior to this, had been in a condition nearly bordering on idiocy.\r\nThere were, to be sure, momentary intervals of perfect sanity, and, now\r\nand then, even of energy; but these were few. It must be remembered\r\nthat I had been, for many days certainly, inhaling the almost\r\npestilential atmosphere of a close hold in a whaling vessel, and a long\r\nportion of that time but scantily supplied with water. For the last\r\nfourteen or fifteen hours I had none--nor had I slept during that time.\r\nSalt provisions of the most exciting kind had been my chief, and,\r\nindeed, since the loss of the mutton, my only supply of food, with the\r\nexception of the sea-biscuit; and these latter were utterly useless to\r\nme, as they were too dry and hard to be swallowed in the swollen and\r\nparched condition of my throat. I was now in a high state of fever, and\r\nin every respect exceedingly ill. This will account for the fact that\r\nmany miserable hours of despondency elapsed after my last adventure\r\nwith the phosphorus, before the thought suggested itself that I had\r\nexamined only one side of the paper. I shall not attempt to describe my\r\nfeelings of rage (for I believe I was more angry than anything else)\r\nwhen the egregious oversight I had committed flashed suddenly upon my\r\nperception. The blunder itself would have been unimportant, had not my\r\nown folly and impetuosity rendered it otherwise--in my disappointment\r\nat not finding some words upon the slip, I had childishly torn it in\r\npieces and thrown it away, it was impossible to say where.\r\n\r\nFrom the worst part of this dilemma I was relieved by the sagacity of\r\nTiger. Having got, after a long search, a small piece of the note, I\r\nput it to the dog\'s nose, and endeavoured to make him understand that\r\nhe must bring me the rest of it. To my astonishment (for I had taught\r\nhim none of the usual tricks for which his breed are famous), he seemed\r\nto enter at once into my meaning, and, rummaging about for a few\r\nmoments, soon found another considerable portion. Bringing me this, he\r\npaused a while, and, rubbing his nose against my hand, appeared to be\r\nwaiting for my approval of what he had done. I patted him on the head,\r\nwhen he immediately made off again. It was now some minutes before he\r\ncame back--but when he did come, he brought with him a large slip,\r\nwhich proved to be all the paper missing--it having been torn, it\r\nseems, only into three pieces. Luckily, I had no trouble in finding\r\nwhat few fragments of the phosphorus were left--being guided by the\r\nindistinct glow one or two of the particles still emitted. My\r\ndifficulties had taught me the necessity of caution, and I now took\r\ntime to reflect upon what I was about to do. It was very probable, I\r\nconsidered, that some words were written upon that side of the paper\r\nwhich had not been examined--but which side was that? Fitting the\r\npieces together gave me no clew in this respect, although it assured me\r\nthat the words (if there were any) would be found all on one side, and\r\nconnected in a proper manner, as written. There was the greater\r\nnecessity of ascertaining the point in question beyond a doubt, as the\r\nphosphorus remaining would be altogether insufficient for a third\r\nattempt, should I fail in the one I was now about to make. I placed the\r\npaper on a book as before, and sat for some minutes thoughtfully\r\nrevolving the matter over in my mind. At last I thought it barely\r\npossible that the written side might have some unevenness on its\r\nsurface, which a delicate sense of feeling might enable me to detect. I\r\ndetermined to make the experiment, and passed my finger very carefully\r\nover the side which first presented itself--nothing, however, was\r\nperceptible, and I turned the paper, adjusting it on the book. I now\r\nagain carried my forefinger cautiously along, when I was aware of an\r\nexceedingly slight, but still discernible glow, which followed as it\r\nproceeded. This, I knew, must arise from some very minute remaining\r\nparticles of the phosphorus with which I had covered the paper in my\r\nprevious attempt. The other, or under side, then, was that on which lay\r\nthe writing, if writing there should finally prove to be. Again I\r\nturned the note, and went to work as I had previously done. Having\r\nrubbed in the phosphorus, a brilliancy ensued as before--but this time\r\nseveral lines of MS. in a large hand, and apparently in red ink, became\r\ndistinctly visible. The glimmer, although sufficiently bright, was but\r\nmomentary. Still, had I not been too greatly excited, there would have\r\nbeen ample time enough for me to peruse the whole three sentences\r\nbefore me--for I saw there were three. In my anxiety, however, to read\r\nall at once, I succeeded only in reading the seven concluding words,\r\nwhich thus appeared: _"blood--your life depends upon lying close."_\r\n\r\nHad I been able to ascertain the entire contents of the note--the full\r\nmeaning of the admonition which my friend had thus attempted to convey,\r\nthat admonition, even although it should have revealed a story of\r\ndisaster the most unspeakable, could not, I am firmly convinced, have\r\nimbued my mind with one tithe of the harrowing and yet indefinable\r\nhorror with which I was inspired by the fragmentary warning thus\r\nreceived. And _"blood"_ too, that word of all words--so rife at all\r\ntimes with mystery, and suffering, and terror--how trebly full of\r\nimport did it now appear--how chillily and heavily (disjointed, as it\r\nthus was, from any foregoing words to qualify or render it distinct)\r\ndid its vague syllables fall, amid the deep gloom of my prison, into\r\nthe innermost recesses of my soul!\r\n\r\nAugustus had, undoubtedly, good reasons for wishing me to remain\r\nconcealed, and I formed a thousand surmises as to what they could\r\nbe--but I could think of nothing affording a satisfactory solution of\r\nthe mystery. Just after returning from my last journey to the trap, and\r\nbefore my attention had been otherwise directed by the singular conduct\r\nof Tiger, I had come to the resolution of making myself heard at all\r\nevents by those on board, or, if I could not succeed in this directly,\r\nof trying to cut my way through the orlop deck. The half certainty\r\nwhich I felt of being able to accomplish one of these two purposes in\r\nthe last emergency, had given me courage (which I should not otherwise\r\nhave had) to endure the evils of my situation. The few words I had been\r\nable to read, however, had cut me off from these final resources, and I\r\nnow, for the first time, felt all the misery of my fate. In a paroxysm\r\nof despair I threw myself again upon the mattress, where, for about the\r\nperiod of a day and night, I lay in a kind of stupor, relieved only by\r\nmomentary intervals of reason and recollection.\r\n\r\nAt length I once more arose, and busied myself in reflection upon the\r\nhorrors which encompassed me. For another twenty-four hours it was\r\nbarely possible that I might exist without water--for a longer time I\r\ncould not do so. During the first portion of my imprisonment I had made\r\nfree use of the cordials with which Augustus had supplied me, but they\r\nonly served to excite fever, without in the least degree assuaging my\r\nthirst. I had now only about a gill left, and this was of a species of\r\nstrong peach liqueur at which my stomach revolted. The sausages were\r\nentirely consumed; of the ham nothing remained but a small piece of the\r\nskin; and all the biscuit, except a few fragments of one, had been\r\neaten by Tiger. To add to my troubles, I found that my headache was\r\nincreasing momentarily, and with it the species of delirium which had\r\ndistressed me more or less since my first falling asleep. For some\r\nhours past it had been with the greatest difficulty I could breathe at\r\nall, and now each attempt at so doing was attended with the most\r\ndistressing spasmodic action of the chest. But there was still another\r\nand very different source of disquietude, and one, indeed, whose\r\nharassing terrors had been the chief means of arousing me to exertion\r\nfrom my stupor on the mattress. It arose from the demeanour of the dog.\r\n\r\nI first observed an alteration in his conduct while rubbing in the\r\nphosphorus on the paper in my last attempt. As I rubbed, he ran his\r\nnose against my hand with a slight snarl; but I was too greatly excited\r\nat the time to pay much attention to the circumstance. Soon afterward,\r\nit will be remembered, I threw myself on the mattress, and fell into a\r\nspecies of lethargy. Presently I became aware of a singular hissing\r\nsound close at my ears, and discovered it to proceed from Tiger, who\r\nwas panting and wheezing in a state of the greatest apparent\r\nexcitement, his eyeballs flashing fiercely through the gloom. I spoke\r\nto him, when he replied with a low growl, and then remained quiet.\r\nPresently I relapsed into my stupor, from which I was again awakened in\r\na similar manner. This was repeated three or four times, until finally\r\nhis behaviour inspired me with so great a degree of fear that I became\r\nfully aroused. He was now lying close by the door of the box, snarling\r\nfearfully, although in a kind of under tone, and grinding his teeth as\r\nif strongly convulsed. I had no doubt whatever that the want of water\r\nor the confined atmosphere of the hold had driven him mad, and I was at\r\na loss what course to pursue. I could not endure the thought of killing\r\nhim, yet it seemed absolutely necessary for my own safety. I could\r\ndistinctly perceive his eyes fastened upon me with an expression of the\r\nmost deadly animosity, and I expected every instant that he would\r\nattack me. At last I could endure my terrible situation no longer, and\r\ndetermined to make my way from the box at all hazards, and despatch\r\nhim, if his opposition should render it necessary for me to do so. To\r\nget out, I had to pass directly over his body, and he already seemed to\r\nanticipate my design--raising himself upon his fore legs (as I\r\nperceived by the altered position of his eyes), and displaying the\r\nwhole of his white fangs, which were easily discernible. I took the\r\nremains of the ham-skin, and the bottle containing the liqueur, and\r\nsecured them about my person, together with a large carving-knife which\r\nAugustus had left me--then, folding my cloak as closely around me as\r\npossible, I made a movement towards the mouth of the box. No sooner did\r\nI do this than the dog sprang with a loud growl towards my throat. The\r\nwhole weight of his body struck me on the right shoulder, and I fell\r\nviolently to the left, while the enraged animal passed entirely over\r\nme. I had fallen upon my knees, with my head buried among the blankets,\r\nand these protected me from a second furious assault, during which I\r\nfelt the sharp teeth pressing vigorously upon the woollen which\r\nenveloped my neck--yet, luckily, without being able to penetrate all\r\nthe folds. I was now beneath the dog, and a few moments would place me\r\ncompletely in his power. Despair gave me strength, and I rose bodily\r\nup, shaking him from me by main force, and dragging with me the\r\nblankets from the mattress. These I now threw over him, and before he\r\ncould extricate himself I had got through the door and closed it\r\neffectually against his pursuit. In this struggle, however, I had been\r\nforced to drop the morsel of ham-skin, and I now found my whole stock\r\nof provisions reduced to a single gill of liqueur. As this reflection\r\ncrossed my mind, I felt myself actuated by one of those fits of\r\nperverseness which might be supposed to influence a spoiled child in\r\nsimilar circumstances, and, raising the bottle to my lips, I drained it\r\nto the last drop, and dashed it furiously upon the floor.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the echo of the crash died away, when I heard my name\r\npronounced in an eager but subdued voice, issuing from the direction of\r\nthe steerage. So unexpected was anything of the kind, and so intense\r\nwas the emotion excited within me by the sound, that I endeavoured in\r\nvain to reply. My powers of speech totally failed, and, in an agony of\r\nterror lest my friend should conclude me dead, and return without\r\nattempting to reach me, I stood up between the crates near the door of\r\nthe box, trembling convulsively, and gasping and struggling for\r\nutterance. Had a thousand worlds depended upon a syllable, I could not\r\nhave spoken it. There was a slight movement now audible among the\r\nlumber somewhere forward of my station. The sound presently grew less\r\ndistinct, then again less so, and still less. Shall I ever forget my\r\nfeelings at this moment? He was going--my friend--my companion, from\r\nwhom I had a right to expect so much--he was going--he would abandon\r\nme--he was gone! He would leave me to perish miserably, to expire in\r\nthe most horrible and loathsome of dungeons--and one word--one little\r\nsyllable would save me--yet that single syllable I could not utter! I\r\nfelt, I am sure, more than ten thousand times the agonies of death\r\nitself. My brain reeled, and I fell, deadly sick, against the end of\r\nthe box.\r\n\r\nAs I fell, the carving-knife was shaken out from the waistband of my\r\npantaloons, and dropped with a rattling sound to the floor. Never did\r\nany strain of the richest melody come so sweetly to my ears! With the\r\nintensest anxiety I listened to ascertain the effect of the noise upon\r\nAugustus--for I knew that the person who called my name could be no one\r\nbut himself. All was silent for some moments. At length I again heard\r\nthe word _Arthur!_ repeated in a low tone, and one full of hesitation.\r\nReviving hope loosened at once my powers of speech, and I now screamed,\r\nat the top of my voice, _"Augustus! oh Augustus!"_ "Hush--for God\'s\r\nsake be silent!" he replied, in a voice trembling with agitation; "I\r\nwill be with you immediately--as soon as I can make my way through the\r\nhold." For a long time I heard him moving among the lumber, and every\r\nmoment seemed to me an age. At length I felt his hand upon my shoulder,\r\nand he placed at the same moment a bottle of water to my lips. Those\r\nonly who have been suddenly redeemed from the jaws of the tomb, or who\r\nhave known the insufferable torments of thirst under circumstances as\r\naggravated as those which encompassed me in my dreary prison, can form\r\nany idea of the unutterable transports which that one long draught of\r\nthe richest of all physical luxuries afforded.\r\n\r\nWhen I had in some degree satisfied my thirst, Augustus produced from\r\nhis pocket three or four cold boiled potatoes, which I devoured with\r\nthe greatest avidity. He had brought with him a light in a dark\r\nlantern, and the grateful rays afforded me scarcely less comfort than\r\nthe food and drink. But I was impatient to learn the cause of his\r\nprotracted absence, and he proceeded to recount what had happened on\r\nboard during my incarceration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brig put to sea, as I had supposed, in about an hour after he had\r\nleft the watch. This was on the twentieth of June. It will be\r\nremembered that I had then been in the hold for three days; and, during\r\nthis period, there was so constant a bustle on board, and so much\r\nrunning to and fro, especially in the cabin and staterooms, that he had\r\nhad no chance of visiting me without the risk of having the secret of\r\nthe trap discovered. When at length he did come, I had assured him that\r\nI was doing as well as possible; and, therefore, for the two next days\r\nhe felt but little uneasiness on my account--still, however, watching\r\nan opportunity of going down. It was not _until the fourth day_ that he\r\nfound one. Several times during this interval he had made up his mind\r\nto let his father know of the adventure, and have me come up at once;\r\nbut we were still within reaching distance of Nantucket, and it was\r\ndoubtful, from some expressions which had escaped Captain Barnard,\r\nwhether he would not immediately put back if he discovered me to be on\r\nboard. Besides, upon thinking the matter over, Augustus, so he told me,\r\ncould not imagine that I was in immediate want, or that I would\r\nhesitate, in such case, to make myself heard at the trap. When,\r\ntherefore, he considered everything, he concluded to let me stay until\r\nhe could meet with an opportunity of visiting me unobserved. This, as I\r\nsaid before, did not occur until the fourth day after his bringing me\r\nthe watch, and the seventh since I had first entered the hold. He then\r\nwent down without taking with him any water or provisions, intending in\r\nthe first place merely to call my attention, and get me to come from\r\nthe box to the trap--when he would go up to the stateroom and thence\r\nhand me down a supply. When he descended for this purpose he found that\r\nI was asleep, for it seems that I was snoring very loudly. From all the\r\ncalculations I can make on the subject, this must have been the slumber\r\ninto which I fell just after my return from the trap with the watch,\r\nand which, consequently, must have lasted _for more than three entire\r\ndays and nights_ at the very least. Latterly, I have had reason, both\r\nfrom my own experience and the assurance of others, to be acquainted\r\nwith the strong soporific effects of the stench arising from old\r\nfish-oil when closely confined; and when I think of the condition of\r\nthe hold in which I was imprisoned, and the long period during which\r\nthe brig had been used as a whaling vessel, I am more inclined to\r\nwonder that I awoke at all, after once falling asleep, than that I\r\nshould have slept uninterruptedly for the period specified above.\r\n\r\nAugustus called to me at first in a low voice and without closing the\r\ntrap--but I made him no reply. He then shut the trap, and spoke to me\r\nin a louder, and finally in a very loud tone--still I continued to\r\nsnore. He was now at a loss what to do. It would take him some time to\r\nmake his way through the lumber to my box, and in the mean while his\r\nabsence would be noticed by Captain Barnard, who had occasion for his\r\nservices every minute, in arranging and copying papers connected with\r\nthe business of the voyage. He determined, therefore, upon reflection,\r\nto ascend, and await another opportunity of visiting me. He was the\r\nmore easily induced to this resolve, as my slumber appeared to be of\r\nthe most tranquil nature, and he could not suppose that I had undergone\r\nany inconvenience from my incarceration. He had just made up his mind\r\non these points when his attention was arrested by an unusual bustle,\r\nthe sound of which proceeded apparently from the cabin. He sprang\r\nthrough the trap as quickly as possible, closed it, and threw open the\r\ndoor of his stateroom. No sooner had he put his foot over the threshold\r\nthan a pistol flashed in his face, and he was knocked down, at the same\r\nmoment, by a blow from a handspike.\r\n\r\nA strong hand held him on the cabin floor, with a tight grasp upon his\r\nthroat--still he was able to see what was going on around him. His\r\nfather was tied hand and foot, and lying along the steps of the\r\ncompanion-way with his head down, and a deep wound in the forehead,\r\nfrom which the blood was flowing in a continued stream. He spoke not a\r\nword, and was apparently dying. Over him stood the first mate, eying\r\nhim with an expression of fiendish derision, and deliberately searching\r\nhis pockets, from which he presently drew forth a large wallet and a\r\nchronometer. Seven of the crew (among whom was the cook, a negro) were\r\nrummaging the staterooms on the larboard for arms, where they soon\r\nequipped themselves with muskets and ammunition. Besides Augustus and\r\nCaptain Barnard, there were nine men altogether in the cabin, and these\r\namong the most ruffianly of the brig\'s company. The villains now went\r\nupon deck, taking my friend with them, after having secured his arms\r\nbehind his back. They proceeded straight to the forecastle, which was\r\nfastened down--two of the mutineers standing by it with axes--two also\r\nat the main hatch. The mate called out in a loud voice, "Do you hear\r\nthere below? tumble up with you--one by one, now, mark that--and no\r\ngrumbling." It was some minutes before any one appeared: at last an\r\nEnglishman, who had shipped as a raw hand, came up, weeping piteously,\r\nand entreating the mate in the most humble manner to spare his life.\r\nThe only reply was a blow on the forehead from an axe. The poor fellow\r\nfell to the deck without a groan, and the black cook lifted him up in\r\nhis arms as he would a child, and tossed him deliberately into the sea.\r\nHearing the blow and the plunge of the body, the men below could now be\r\ninduced to venture on deck neither by threats nor promises, until a\r\nproposition was made to smoke them out. A general rush then ensued, and\r\nfor a moment it seemed possible that the brig might be retaken. The\r\nmutineers, however, succeeded at last in closing the forecastle\r\neffectually before more than six of their opponents could get up. These\r\nsix, finding themselves so greatly outnumbered and without arms,\r\nsubmitted after a brief struggle. The mate gave them fair words--no\r\ndoubt with a view of inducing those below to yield, for they had no\r\ndifficulty in hearing all that was said on deck. The result proved his\r\nsagacity, no less than his diabolical villany. All in the forecastle\r\npresently signified their intention of submitting, and, ascending one\r\nby one, were pinioned and thrown on their backs together with the first\r\nsix--there being in all, of the crew who were not concerned in the\r\nmutiny, twenty-seven.\r\n\r\nA scene of the most horrible butchery ensued. The bound seamen were\r\ndragged to the gangway. Here the cook stood with an axe, striking each\r\nvictim on the head as he was forced over the side of the vessel by the\r\nother mutineers. In this manner twenty-two perished, and Augustus had\r\ngiven himself up for lost, expecting every moment his own turn to come\r\nnext. But it seemed that the villains were now either weary, or in some\r\nmeasure disgusted with their bloody labour; for the four remaining\r\nprisoners, together with my friend, who had been thrown on the deck\r\nwith the rest, were respited while the mate sent below for rum, and the\r\nwhole murderous party held a drunken carouse, which lasted until\r\nsunset. They now fell to disputing in regard to the fate of the\r\nsurvivers, who lay not more than four paces off, and could distinguish\r\nevery word said. Upon some of the mutineers the liquor appeared to have\r\na softening effect, for several voices were heard in favour of\r\nreleasing the captives altogether, on condition of joining the mutiny\r\nand sharing the profits. The black cook, however (who in all respects\r\nwas a perfect demon, and who seemed to exert as much influence, if not\r\nmore, than the mate himself), would listen to no proposition of the\r\nkind, and rose repeatedly for the purpose of resuming his work at the\r\ngangway. Fortunately, he was so far overcome by intoxication as to be\r\neasily restrained by the less bloodthirsty of the party, among whom was\r\na line-manager, who went by the name of Dirk Peters. This man was the\r\nson of an Indian squaw of the tribe of Upsarokas, who live among the\r\nfastnesses of the Black Hills near the source of the Missouri. His\r\nfather was a fur-trader, I believe, or at least connected in some\r\nmanner with the Indian trading-posts on Lewis river. Peters himself was\r\none of the most purely ferocious-looking men I ever beheld. He was\r\nshort in stature--not more than four feet eight inches high--but his\r\nlimbs were of the most Herculean mould. His hands, especially, were so\r\nenormously thick and broad as hardly to retain a human shape. His arms,\r\nas well as legs, were _bowed_ in the most singular manner, and appeared\r\nto possess no flexibility whatever. His head was equally deformed,\r\nbeing of immense size, with an indentation on the crown (like that on\r\nthe head of most negroes), and entirely bald. To conceal this latter\r\ndeficiency, which did not proceed from old age, he usually wore a wig\r\nformed of any hair-like material which presented itself--occasionally\r\nthe skin of a Spanish dog or American grizzly bear. At the time spoken\r\nof he had on a portion of one of these bearskins; and it added no\r\nlittle to the natural ferocity of his countenance, which betook of the\r\nUpsaroka character. The mouth extended nearly from ear to ear; the lips\r\nwere thin, and seemed, like some other portions of his frame, to be\r\ndevoid of natural pliancy, so that the ruling expression never varied\r\nunder the influence of any emotion whatever. This ruling expression may\r\nbe conceived when it is considered that the teeth were exceedingly long\r\nand protruding, and never even partially covered, in any instance, by\r\nthe lips. To pass this man with a casual glance, one might imagine him\r\nto be convulsed with laughter--but a second look would induce a\r\nshuddering acknowledgment, that if such an expression were indicative\r\nof merriment, the merriment must be that of a demon. Of this singular\r\nbeing many anecdotes were prevalent among the seafaring men of\r\nNantucket. These anecdotes went to prove his prodigious strength when\r\nunder excitement, and some of them had given rise to a doubt of his\r\nsanity. But on board the Grampus, it seems, he was regarded at the time\r\nof the mutiny with feelings more of derision than of anything else. I\r\nhave been thus particular in speaking of Dirk Peters, because,\r\nferocious as he appeared, he proved the main instrument in preserving\r\nthe life of Augustus, and because I shall have frequent occasion to\r\nmention him hereafter in the course of my narrative--a narrative, let\r\nme here say, which, in its latter portions, will be found to include\r\nincidents of a nature so entirely out of the range of human experience,\r\nand for this reason so far beyond the limits of human credulity, that I\r\nproceed in utter hopelessness of obtaining credence for all that I\r\nshall tell, yet confidently trusting in time and progressing science to\r\nverify some of the most important and most improbable of my statements.\r\n\r\nAfter much indecision and two or three violent quarrels, it was\r\ndetermined at last that all the prisoners (with the exception of\r\nAugustus, whom Peters insisted in a jocular manner upon keeping as his\r\nclerk) should be set adrift in one of the smallest whaleboats. The mate\r\nwent down into the cabin to see if Captain Barnard was still\r\nliving--for, it will be remembered, he was left below when the\r\nmutineers came up. Presently the two made their appearance, the captain\r\npale as death, but somewhat recovered from the effects of his wound. He\r\nspoke to the men in a voice hardly articulate, entreated them not to\r\nset him adrift, but to return to their duty, and promising to land them\r\nwherever they chose, and to take no steps for bringing them to justice.\r\nHe might as well have spoken to the winds. Two of the ruffians seized\r\nhim by the arms and hurled him over the brig\'s side into the boat,\r\nwhich had been lowered while the mate went below. The four men who were\r\nlying on the deck were then untied and ordered to follow, which they\r\ndid without attempting any resistance--Augustus being still left in his\r\npainful position, although he struggled and prayed only for the poor\r\nsatisfaction of being permitted to bid his father farewell. A handful\r\nof sea-biscuit and a jug of water were now handed down; but neither\r\nmast, sail, oar, nor compass. The boat was towed astern for a few\r\nminutes, during which the mutineers held another consultation--it was\r\nthen finally cut adrift. By this time night had come on--there were\r\nneither moon nor stars visible--and a short and ugly sea was running,\r\nalthough there was no great deal of wind. The boat was instantly out of\r\nsight, and little hope could be entertained for the unfortunate\r\nsufferers who were in it. This event happened, however, in latitude 35\xb0\r\n30\' north, longitude 61\xb0 20\' west, and consequently at no very great\r\ndistance from the Bermuda Islands. Augustus therefore endeavoured to\r\nconsole himself with the idea that the boat might either succeed in\r\nreaching the land, or come sufficiently near to be fallen in with by\r\nvessels off the coast.\r\n\r\nAll sail was now put upon the brig, and she continued her original\r\ncourse to the southwest--the mutineers being bent upon some piratical\r\nexpedition, in which, from all that could be understood, a ship was to\r\nbe intercepted on her way from the Cape Verd Islands to Porto Rico. No\r\nattention was paid to Augustus, who was untied and suffered to go about\r\nanywhere forward of the cabin companion-way. Dirk Peters treated him\r\nwith some degree of kindness, and on one occasion saved him from the\r\nbrutality of the cook. His situation was still one of the most\r\nprecarious, as the men were continually intoxicated, and there was no\r\nrelying upon their continued good-humour or carelessness in regard to\r\nhimself. His anxiety on my account he represented, however, as the most\r\ndistressing result of his condition; and, indeed, I had never reason to\r\ndoubt the sincerity of his friendship. More than once he had resolved\r\nto acquaint the mutineers with the secret of my being on board, but was\r\nrestrained from so doing, partly through recollection of the atrocities\r\nhe had already beheld, and partly through a hope of being able soon to\r\nbring me relief. For the latter purpose he was constantly on the watch;\r\nbut, in spite of the most constant vigilance, three days elapsed after\r\nthe boat was cut adrift before any chance occurred. At length, on the\r\nnight of the third day, there came on a heavy blow from the eastward,\r\nand all hands were called up to take in sail. During the confusion\r\nwhich ensued, he made his way below unobserved, and into the stateroom.\r\nWhat was his grief and horror in discovering that the latter had been\r\nrendered a place of deposite for a variety of sea-stores and\r\nship-furniture, and that several fathoms of old chain-cable, which had\r\nbeen stowed away beneath the companion-ladder, had been dragged thence\r\nto make room for a chest, and were now lying immediately upon the trap!\r\nTo remove it without discovery was impossible, and he returned on deck\r\nas quickly as he could. As he came up the mate seized him by the\r\nthroat, and demanding what he had been doing in the cabin, was about\r\nflinging him over the larboard bulwark, when his life was again\r\npreserved through the interference of Dirk Peters. Augustus was now put\r\nin handcuffs (of which there were several pairs on board), and his feet\r\nlashed tightly together. He was then taken into the steerage, and\r\nthrown into a lower berth next to the forecastle bulkheads, with the\r\nassurance that he should never put his foot on deck again "until the\r\nbrig was no longer a brig." This was the expression of the cook, who\r\nthrew him into the berth--it is hardly possible to say what precise\r\nmeaning was intended by the phrase. The whole affair, however, proved\r\nthe ultimate means of my relief, as will presently appear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some minutes after the cook had left the forecastle, Augustus\r\nabandoned himself to despair, never hoping to leave the berth alive. He\r\nnow came to the resolution of acquainting the first of the men who\r\nshould come down with my situation, thinking it better to let me take\r\nmy chance with the mutineers than perish of thirst in the hold--for it\r\nhad been ten days since I was first imprisoned, and my jug of water was\r\nnot a plentiful supply even for four. As he was thinking on this\r\nsubject, the idea came all at once into his head that it might be\r\npossible to communicate with me by the way of the main hold. In any\r\nother circumstances, the difficulty and hazard of the undertaking would\r\nhave prevented him from attempting it; but now he had, at all events,\r\nlittle prospect of life, and consequently little to lose--he bent his\r\nwhole mind, therefore, upon the task.\r\n\r\nHis handcuffs were the first consideration. At first he saw no method\r\nof removing them, and feared that he should thus be baffled in the very\r\noutset; but, upon a closer scrutiny, he discovered that the irons could\r\nbe slipped off and on at pleasure with very little effort or\r\ninconvenience, merely by squeezing his hands through them--this species\r\nof manacle being altogether ineffectual in confining young persons, in\r\nwhom the smaller bones readily yield to pressure. He now untied his\r\nfeet, and, leaving the cord in such a manner that it could easily be\r\nreadjusted in the event of any person\'s coming down, proceeded to\r\nexamine the bulkhead where it joined the berth. The partition here was\r\nof soft pine board, an inch thick, and he saw that he should have\r\nlittle trouble in cutting his way through. A voice was now heard at the\r\nforecastle companion-way, and he had just time to put his right hand\r\ninto its handcuff (the left had not been removed), and to draw the rope\r\nin a slipknot around his ankle, when Dirk Peters came below, followed\r\nby Tiger, who immediately leaped into the berth and lay down. The dog\r\nhad been brought on board by Augustus, who knew my attachment to the\r\nanimal, and thought it would give me pleasure to have him with me\r\nduring the voyage. He went up to our house for him immediately after\r\nfirst taking me into the hold, but did not think of mentioning the\r\ncircumstance upon his bringing the watch. Since the mutiny, Augustus\r\nhad not seen him before his appearance with Dirk Peters, and had given\r\nhim up for lost, supposing him to have been thrown overboard by some of\r\nthe malignant villains belonging to the mate\'s gang. It appeared\r\nafterward that he had crawled into a hole beneath a whaleboat, from\r\nwhich, not having room to turn round, he could not extricate himself.\r\nPeters at last let him out, and with a species of good feeling which my\r\nfriend knew well how to appreciate, had now brought him to him in the\r\nforecastle as a companion, leaving at the same time some salt junk and\r\npotatoes, with a can of water; he then went on deck, promising to come\r\ndown with something more to eat on the next day.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone, Augustus freed both hands from the manacles and\r\nunfastened his feet. He then turned down the head of the mattress on\r\nwhich he had been lying, and with his penknife (for the ruffians had\r\nnot thought it worth while to search him) commenced cutting vigorously\r\nacross one of the partition planks, as closely as possible to the floor\r\nof the berth. He chose to cut here, because, if suddenly interrupted,\r\nhe would be able to conceal what had been done by letting the head of\r\nthe mattress fall into its proper position. For the remainder of the\r\nday, however, no disturbance occurred, and by night he had completely\r\ndivided the plank. It should here be observed, that none of the crew\r\noccupied the forecastle as a sleeping-place, living altogether in the\r\ncabin since the mutiny, drinking the wines, and feasting on the sea\r\nstores of Captain Barnard, and giving no more heed than was absolutely\r\nnecessary to the navigation of the brig. These circumstances proved\r\nfortunate both for myself and Augustus; for, had matters been\r\notherwise, he would have found it impossible to reach me. As it was, he\r\nproceeded with confidence in his design. It was near daybreak, however,\r\nbefore he completed the second division of the board (which was about a\r\nfoot above the first cut), thus making an aperture quite large enough\r\nto admit his passage through with facility to the main orlop deck.\r\nHaving got here, he made his way with but little trouble to the lower\r\nmain hatch, although in so doing he had to scramble over tiers of\r\noil-casks piled nearly as high as the upper deck, there being barely\r\nroom enough left for his body. Upon reaching the hatch, he found that\r\nTiger had followed him below, squeezing between two rows of the casks.\r\nIt was now too late, however, to attempt getting to me before dawn, as\r\nthe chief difficulty lay in passing through the close stowage in the\r\nlower hold. He therefore resolved to return, and wait till the next\r\nnight. With this design he proceeded to loosen the hatch, so that he\r\nmight have as little detention as possible when he should come again.\r\nNo sooner had he loosened it than Tiger sprang eagerly to the small\r\nopening produced, snuffed for a moment, and then uttered a long whine,\r\nscratching at the same time, as if anxious to remove the covering with\r\nhis paws. There could be no doubt, from his behaviour, that he was\r\naware of my being in the hold, and Augustus thought it possible that he\r\nwould be able to get to me if he put him down. He now hit upon the\r\nexpedient of sending the note, as it was especially desirable that I\r\nshould make no attempt at forcing my way out, at least under existing\r\ncircumstances, and there could be no certainty of his getting to me\r\nhimself on the morrow as he intended. After events proved how fortunate\r\nit was that the idea occurred to him as it did: for, had it not been\r\nfor the receipt of the note, I should undoubtedly have fallen upon some\r\nplan, however desperate, of alarming the crew, and both our lives would\r\nmost probably have been sacrificed in consequence.\r\n\r\nHaving concluded to write, the difficulty was now to procure the\r\nmaterials for so doing. An old toothpick was soon made into a pen; and\r\nthis by means of feeling altogether, for the between-decks were as dark\r\nas pitch. Paper enough was obtained from the back of a letter--a\r\nduplicate of the forged letter from Mr. Ross. This had been the\r\noriginal draught; but the handwriting not being sufficiently well\r\nimitated, Augustus had written another, thrusting the first, by good\r\nfortune, into his coat-pocket, where it was now most opportunely\r\ndiscovered. Ink alone was thus wanting, and a substitute was\r\nimmediately found for this by means of a slight incision with the\r\npenknife on the back of a finger just above the nail--a copious flow of\r\nblood ensuing, as usual from wounds in that vicinity. The note was now\r\nwritten, as well as it could be in the dark and under the\r\ncircumstances. It briefly explained that a mutiny had taken place; that\r\nCaptain Barnard was set adrift; and that I might expect immediate\r\nrelief as far as provisions were concerned, but must not venture upon\r\nmaking any disturbance. It concluded with these words, _"I have\r\nscrawled this with blood--your life depends upon lying close."_\r\n\r\nThe slip of paper being tied upon the dog, he was now put down the\r\nhatchway, and Augustus made the best of his way back to the forecastle,\r\nwhere he found no reason to believe that any of the crew had been in\r\nhis absence. To conceal the hole in the partition, he drove his knife\r\nin just above it, and hung up a pea-jacket which he found in the berth.\r\nHis handcuffs were then replaced, and also the rope around his ankles.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements were scarcely completed when Dirk Peters came below,\r\nvery drunk, but in excellent humour, and bringing with him my friend\'s\r\nallowance of provision for the day. This consisted of a dozen large\r\nIrish potatoes roasted, and a pitcher of water. He sat for some time on\r\na chest by the berth, and talked freely about the mate, and the general\r\nconcerns of the brig. His demeanour was exceedingly capricious and even\r\ngrotesque. At one time Augustus was much alarmed by his odd conduct. At\r\nlast, however, he went on deck, muttering a promise to bring his\r\nprisoner a good dinner on the morrow. During the day two of the crew\r\n(harpooners) came down, accompanied by the cook, all three in nearly\r\nthe last stage of intoxication. Like Peters, they made no scruple of\r\ntalking unreservedly about their plans. It appeared that they were much\r\ndivided among themselves as to their ultimate course, agreeing in no\r\npoint except the attack on the ship from the Cape Verd Islands, with\r\nwhich they were in hourly expectation of meeting. As far as could be\r\nascertained, the mutiny had not been brought about altogether for the\r\nsake of booty; a private pique of the chief mate\'s against Captain\r\nBarnard having been the main instigation. There now seemed to be two\r\nprincipal factions among the crew--one headed by the mate, the other by\r\nthe cook. The former party were for seizing the first suitable vessel\r\nwhich should present itself, and equipping it at some of the West India\r\nIslands for a piratical cruise. The latter division, however, which was\r\nthe stronger, and included Dirk Peters among its partisans, were bent\r\nupon pursuing the course originally laid out for the brig into the\r\nSouth Pacific; there either to take whale, or act otherwise, as\r\ncircumstances should suggest. The representations of Peters, who had\r\nfrequently visited these regions, had great weight, apparently, with\r\nthe mutineers, wavering as they were between half-engendered notions of\r\nprofit and pleasure. He dwelt on the world of novelty and amusement to\r\nbe found among the innumerable islands of the Pacific, on the perfect\r\nsecurity and freedom from all restraint to be enjoyed, but, more\r\nparticularly, on the deliciousness of the climate, on the abundant\r\nmeans of good living, and on the voluptuous beauty of the women. As\r\nyet, nothing had been absolutely determined upon; but the pictures of\r\nthe hybrid line-manager were taking strong hold upon the ardent\r\nimaginations of the seamen, and there was every probability that his\r\nintentions would be finally carried into effect.\r\n\r\nThe three men went away in about an hour, and no one else entered the\r\nforecastle all day. Augustus lay quiet until nearly night. He then\r\nfreed himself from the rope and irons, and prepared for his attempt. A\r\nbottle was found in one of the berths, and this he filled with water\r\nfrom the pitcher left by Peters, storing his pockets at the same time\r\nwith cold potatoes. To his great joy he also came across a lantern,\r\nwith a small piece of tallow candle in it. This he could light at any\r\nmoment, as he had in his possession a box of phosphorus matches. When\r\nit was quite dark, he got through the hole in the bulkhead, having\r\ntaken the precaution to arrange the bedclothes in the berth so as to\r\nconvey the idea of a person covered up. When through, he hung up the\r\npea-jacket on his knife, as before, to conceal the aperture--this\r\nmanoeuvre being easily effected, as he did not readjust the piece of\r\nplank taken out until afterward. He was now on the main orlop deck, and\r\nproceeded to make his way, as before, between the upper deck and the\r\noil-casks to the main hatchway. Having reached this, he lit the piece\r\nof candle, and descended, groping with extreme difficulty among the\r\ncompact stowage of the hold. In a few moments he became alarmed at the\r\ninsufferable stench and the closeness of the atmosphere. He could not\r\nthink it possible that I had survived my confinement for so long a\r\nperiod breathing so oppressive an air. He called my name repeatedly,\r\nbut I made him no reply, and his apprehensions seemed thus to be\r\nconfirmed. The brig was rolling violently, and there was so much noise\r\nin consequence, that it was useless to listen for any weak sound, such\r\nas those of my breathing or snoring. He threw open the lantern, and\r\nheld it as high as possible, whenever an opportunity occurred, in order\r\nthat, by observing the light, I might, if alive, be aware that succour\r\nwas approaching. Still nothing was heard from me, and the supposition\r\nof my death began to assume the character of certainty. He determined,\r\nnevertheless, to force a passage, if possible, to the box, and at least\r\nascertain beyond a doubt the truth of his surmises. He pushed on for\r\nsome time in a most pitiable state of anxiety, until, at length, he\r\nfound the pathway utterly blocked up, and that there was no possibility\r\nof making any farther way by the course in which he had set out.\r\nOvercome now by his feelings, he threw himself among the lumber in\r\ndespair, and wept like a child. It was at this period that he heard the\r\ncrash occasioned by the bottle which I had thrown down. Fortunate,\r\nindeed, was it that the incident occurred--for, upon this incident,\r\ntrivial as it appears, the thread of my destiny depended. Many years\r\nelapsed, however, before I was aware of this fact. A natural shame and\r\nregret for his weakness and indecision prevented Augustus from\r\nconfiding to me at once what a more intimate and unreserved communion\r\nafterward induced him to reveal. Upon finding his further progress in\r\nthe hold impeded by obstacles which he could not overcome, he had\r\nresolved to abandon his attempt at reaching me, and return at once to\r\nthe forecastle. Before condemning him entirely on this head, the\r\nharassing circumstances which embarrassed him should be taken into\r\nconsideration. The night was fast wearing away, and his absence from\r\nthe forecastle might be discovered; and, indeed, would necessarily be\r\nso, if he should fail to get back to the berth by daybreak. His candle\r\nwas expiring in the socket, and there would be the greatest difficulty\r\nin retracing his way to the hatchway in the dark. It must be allowed,\r\ntoo, that he had every good reason to believe me dead; in which event\r\nno benefit could result to me from his reaching the box, and a world of\r\ndanger would be encountered to no purpose by himself. He had repeatedly\r\ncalled, and I had made him no answer. I had been now eleven days and\r\nnights with no more water than that contained in the jug which he had\r\nleft with me, a supply which it was not at all probable I had hoarded\r\nin the beginning of my confinement, as I had had every cause to expect\r\na speedy release. The atmosphere of the hold, too, must have appeared\r\nto him, coming from the comparatively open air of the steerage, of a\r\nnature absolutely poisonous, and by far more intolerable than it had\r\nseemed to me upon my first taking up my quarters in the box--the\r\nhatchways at that time having been constantly open for many months\r\nprevious. Add to these considerations that of the scene of bloodshed\r\nand terror so lately witnessed by my friend; his confinement,\r\nprivations, and narrow escapes from death; together with the frail and\r\nequivocal tenure by which he still existed--circumstances all so well\r\ncalculated to prostrate every energy of mind--and the reader will be\r\neasily brought, as I have been, to regard his apparent falling off in\r\nfriendship and in faith with sentiments rather of sorrow than of anger.\r\n\r\nThe crash of the bottle was distinctly heard, yet Augustus was not sure\r\nthat it proceeded from the hold. The doubt, however, was sufficient\r\ninducement to persevere. He clambered up nearly to the orlop deck by\r\nmeans of the stowage, and then watching for a lull in the pitchings of\r\nthe vessel, he called out to me in as loud a tone as he could\r\ncommand--regardless, for the moment, of the danger of being overheard\r\nby the crew. It will be remembered that on this occasion the voice\r\nreached me, but I was so entirely overcome by violent agitation as to\r\nbe incapable of reply. Confident, now, that his worst apprehensions\r\nwere well founded, he descended, with a view of getting back to the\r\nforecastle without loss of time. In his haste some small boxes were\r\nthrown down, the noise occasioned by which I heard, as will be\r\nrecollected. He had made considerable progress on his return when the\r\nfall of the knife again caused him to hesitate. He retraced his steps\r\nimmediately, and, clambering up the stowage a second time, called out\r\nmy name, loudly as before, having watched for a lull. This time I found\r\nvoice to answer. Overjoyed at discovering me to be still alive, he now\r\nresolved to brave every difficulty and danger in reaching me. Having\r\nextricated himself as quickly as possible from the labyrinth of lumber\r\nby which he was hemmed in, he at length struck into an opening which\r\npromised better, and finally, after a series of struggles, arrived at\r\nthe box in a state of utter exhaustion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe leading particulars of this narration were all that Augustus\r\ncommunicated to me while we remained near the box. It was not until\r\nafterward that he entered fully into all the details. He was\r\napprehensive of being missed, and I was wild with impatience to leave\r\nmy detested place of confinement. We resolved to make our way at once\r\nto the hole in the bulkhead, near which I was to remain for the\r\npresent, while he went through to reconnoitre. To leave Tiger in the\r\nbox was what neither of us could endure to think of; yet, how to act\r\notherwise was the question. He now seemed to be perfectly quiet, and we\r\ncould not even distinguish the sound of his breathing upon applying our\r\nears closely to the box. I was convinced that he was dead, and\r\ndetermined to open the door. We found him lying at full length,\r\napparently in a deep stupor, yet still alive. No time was to be lost,\r\nyet I could not bring myself to abandon an animal who had now been\r\ntwice instrumental in saving my life, without some attempt at\r\npreserving him. We therefore dragged him along with us as well as we\r\ncould, although with the greatest difficulty and fatigue; Augustus,\r\nduring part of the time, being forced to clamber over the impediments\r\nin our way with the huge dog in his arms--a feat to which the\r\nfeebleness of my frame rendered me totally inadequate. At length we\r\nsucceeded in reaching the hole, when Augustus got through, and Tiger\r\nwas pushed in afterward. All was found to be safe, and we did not fail\r\nto return sincere thanks to God for our deliverance from the imminent\r\ndanger we had escaped. For the present it was agreed that I should\r\nremain near the opening, through which my companion could readily\r\nsupply me with a part of his daily provision, and where I could have\r\nthe advantages of breathing an atmosphere comparatively pure.\r\n\r\nIn explanation of some portions of this narrative wherein I have spoken\r\nof the stowage of the brig, and which may appear ambiguous to some of\r\nmy readers who may have seen a proper or regular stowage, I must here\r\nstate that the manner in which this most important duty had been\r\nperformed on board the Grampus was a most shameful piece of neglect on\r\nthe part of Captain Barnard, who was by no means as careful or as\r\nexperienced a seaman as the hazardous nature of the service on which he\r\nwas employed would seem necessarily to demand. A proper stowage cannot\r\nbe accomplished in a careless manner, and many most disastrous\r\naccidents, even within the limits of my own experience, have arisen\r\nfrom neglect or ignorance in this particular. Coasting vessels, in the\r\nfrequent hurry and bustle attendant upon taking in or discharging\r\ncargo, are the most liable to mishap from the want of a proper\r\nattention to stowage. The great point is to allow no possibility of the\r\ncargo or ballast\'s shifting position even in the most violent rollings\r\nof the vessel. With this end, great attention must be paid, not only to\r\nthe bulk taken in, but to the nature of the bulk, and whether there be\r\na full or only a partial cargo. In most kinds of freight the stowage is\r\naccomplished by means of a screw. Thus, in a load of tobacco or flour,\r\nthe whole is screwed so tightly into the hold of the vessel that the\r\nbarrels or hogsheads upon discharging are found to be completely\r\nflattened, and take some time to regain their original shape. This\r\nscrewing, however, is resorted to principally with a view of obtaining\r\nmore room in the hold; for in a _full_ load of any such commodities as\r\nflour or tobacco, there can be no danger of any shifting whatever, at\r\nleast none from which inconvenience can result. There have been\r\ninstances, indeed, where this method of screwing has resulted in the\r\nmost lamentable consequences, arising from a cause altogether distinct\r\nfrom the danger attendant upon a shifting of cargo. A load of cotton,\r\nfor example, tightly screwed while in certain conditions, has been\r\nknown, through the expansion of its bulk, to rend a vessel asunder at\r\nsea. There can be no doubt, either, that the same result would ensue in\r\nthe case of tobacco, while undergoing its usual course of fermentation,\r\nwere it not for the interstices consequent upon the rotundity of the\r\nhogsheads.\r\n\r\nIt is when a partial cargo is received that danger is chiefly to be\r\napprehended from shifting, and that precautions should be always taken\r\nto guard against such misfortune. Only those who have encountered a\r\nviolent gale of wind, or, rather, who have experienced the rolling of a\r\nvessel in a sudden calm after the gale, can form an idea of the\r\ntremendous force of the plunges, and of the consequent terrible impetus\r\ngiven to all loose articles in the vessel. It is then that the\r\nnecessity of a cautious stowage, when there is a partial cargo, becomes\r\nobvious. When lying to (especially with a small head sail), a vessel\r\nwhich is not properly modelled in the bows is frequently thrown upon\r\nher beam-ends; this occurring even every fifteen or twenty minutes upon\r\nan average, yet without any serious consequences resulting, _provided\r\nthere be a proper stowage_. If this, however, has not been strictly\r\nattended to, in the first of these heavy lurches the whole of the cargo\r\ntumbles over to the side of the vessel which lies upon the water, and,\r\nbeing thus prevented from regaining her equilibrium, as she would\r\notherwise necessarily do, she is certain to fill in a few seconds and\r\ngo down. It is not too much to say that at least one half of the\r\ninstances in which vessels have foundered in heavy gales at sea may be\r\nattributed to a shifting of cargo or of ballast.\r\n\r\nWhen a partial cargo of any kind is taken on board, the whole, after\r\nbeing first stowed as compactly as may be, should be covered with a\r\nlayer of stout shifting-boards, extending completely across the vessel.\r\nUpon these boards strong temporary stanchions should be erected,\r\nreaching to the timbers above, and thus securing everything in its\r\nplace. In cargoes consisting of grain, or any similar matter,\r\nadditional precautions are requisite. A hold filled entirely with grain\r\nupon leaving port will be found not more than three fourths full upon\r\nleaching its destination--this, too, although the freight, when\r\nmeasured bushel by bushel by the consignee, will overrun by a vast deal\r\n(on account of the swelling of the grain) the quantity consigned. This\r\nresult is occasioned by _settling_ during the voyage, and is the more\r\nperceptible in proportion to the roughness of the weather experienced.\r\nIf grain loosely thrown in a vessel, then, is ever so well secured by\r\nshifting-boards and stanchions, it will be liable to shift in a long\r\npassage so greatly as to bring about the most distressing calamities.\r\nTo prevent these, every method should be employed before leaving port\r\nto _settle_ the cargo as much as possible; and for this there are many\r\ncontrivances, among which may be mentioned the driving of wedges into\r\nthe grain. Even after all this is done, and unusual pains taken to\r\nsecure the shifting-boards, no seaman who knows what he is about will\r\nfeel altogether secure in a gale of any violence with a cargo of grain\r\non board, and, least of all, with a partial cargo. Yet there are\r\nhundreds of our coasting vessels, and, it is likely, many more from the\r\nports of Europe, which sail daily with partial cargoes, even of the\r\nmost dangerous species, and without any precautions whatever. The\r\nwonder is that no more accidents occur than do actually happen. A\r\nlamentable instance of this heedlessness occurred to my knowledge in\r\nthe case of Captain Joel Rice of the schooner Firefly, which sailed\r\nfrom Richmond, Virginia, to Madeira, with a cargo of corn, in the year\r\n1825. The captain had gone many voyages without serious accident,\r\nalthough he was in the habit of paying no attention whatever to his\r\nstowage, more than to secure it in the ordinary manner. He had never\r\nbefore sailed with a cargo of grain, and on this occasion had the corn\r\nthrown on board loosely, when it did not much more than half fill the\r\nvessel. For the first portion of the voyage he met with nothing more\r\nthan light breezes; but when within a day\'s sail of Madeira there came\r\non a strong gale from the N. N. E. which forced him to lie to. He\r\nbrought the schooner to the wind under a double-reefed foresail alone,\r\nwhen she rode as well as any vessel could be expected to do, and\r\nshipped not a drop of water. Towards night the gale somewhat abated,\r\nand she rolled with more unsteadiness than before, but still did very\r\nwell, until a heavy lurch threw her upon her beam-ends to starboard.\r\nThe corn was then heard to shift bodily, the force of the movement\r\nbursting open the main hatchway. The vessel went down like a shot. This\r\nhappened within hail of a small sloop from Madeira, which picked up one\r\nof the crew (the only person saved), and which rode out the gale in\r\nperfect security, as indeed a jollyboat might have done under proper\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nThe stowage on board the Grampus was most clumsily done, if stowage\r\nthat could be called which was little better than a promiscuous\r\nhuddling together of oil-casks[1] and ship furniture. I have already\r\nspoken of the condition of articles in the hold. On the orlop deck\r\nthere was space enough for my body (as I have stated) between the\r\noil-casks and the upper deck; a space was left open around the main\r\nhatchway; and several other large spaces were left in the stowage. Near\r\nthe hole cut through the bulkhead by Augustus there was room enough for\r\nan entire cask, and in this space I found myself comfortably situated\r\nfor the present.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Whaling vessels are usually fitted with iron\r\noil-tanks--why the Grampus was not I have never been able to\r\nascertain.]\r\n\r\nBy the time my friend had got safely into the berth, and readjusted his\r\nhandcuffs and the rope, it was broad daylight. We had made a narrow\r\nescape indeed; for scarcely had he arranged all matters, when the mate\r\ncame below, with Dirk Peters and the cook. They talked for some time\r\nabout the vessel from the Cape Verds, and seemed to be excessively\r\nanxious for her appearance. At length the cook came to the berth in\r\nwhich Augustus was lying, and seated himself in it near the head. I\r\ncould see and hear everything from my hiding-place, for the piece cut\r\nout had not been put back, and I was in momentary expectation that the\r\nnegro would fall against the pea-jacket, which was hung up to conceal\r\nthe aperture, in which case all would have been discovered, and our\r\nlives would, no doubt, have been instantly sacrificed. Our good fortune\r\nprevailed, however; and although he frequently touched it as the vessel\r\nrolled, he never pressed against it sufficiently to bring about a\r\ndiscovery. The bottom of the jacket had been carefully fastened to the\r\nbulkhead, so that the hole might not be seen by its swinging to one\r\nside. All this time Tiger was lying in the foot of the berth, and\r\nappeared to have recovered in some measure his faculties, for I could\r\nsee him occasionally open his eyes and draw a long breath.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes the mate and cook went above, leaving Dirk Peters\r\nbehind, who, as soon as they were gone, came and sat himself down in\r\nthe place just occupied by the mate. He began to talk very sociably\r\nwith Augustus, and we could now see that the greater part of his\r\napparent intoxication, while the two others were with him, was a feint.\r\nHe answered all my companion\'s questions with perfect freedom; told him\r\nthat he had no doubt of his father\'s having been picked up, as there\r\nwere no less than five sail in sight just before sundown on the day he\r\nwas cut adrift; and used other language of a consolatory nature, which\r\noccasioned me no less surprise than pleasure. Indeed, I began to\r\nentertain hopes, that through the instrumentality of Peters we might be\r\nfinally enabled to regain possession of the brig, and this idea I\r\nmentioned to Augustus as soon as I found an opportunity. He thought the\r\nmatter possible, but urged the necessity of the greatest caution in\r\nmaking the attempt, as the conduct of the hybrid appeared to be\r\ninstigated by the most arbitrary caprice alone; and, indeed, it was\r\ndifficult to say if he was at any moment of sound mind. Peters went\r\nupon deck in about an hour, and did not return again until noon, when\r\nhe brought Augustus a plentiful supply of junk beef and pudding. Of\r\nthis, when we were left alone, I partook heartily, without returning\r\nthrough the hole. No one else came down into the forecastle during the\r\nday, and at night I got into Augustus\'s berth, where I slept soundly\r\nand sweetly until nearly daybreak, when he awakened me upon hearing a\r\nstir upon deck, and I regained my hiding-place as quickly as possible.\r\nWhen the day was fully broke, we found that Tiger had recovered his\r\nstrength almost entirely, and gave no indications of hydrophobia,\r\ndrinking a little water that was offered him with great apparent\r\neagerness. During the day he regained all his former vigour and\r\nappetite. His strange conduct had been brought on, no doubt, by the\r\ndeleterious quality of the air of the hold, and had no connexion with\r\ncanine madness. I could not sufficiently rejoice that I had persisted\r\nin bringing him with me from the box. This day was the thirtieth of\r\nJune, and the thirteenth since the Grampus made sail from Nantucket.\r\n\r\nOn the second of July the mate came below, drunk as usual, and in an\r\nexcessively good-humour. He came to Augustus\'s berth, and, giving him a\r\nslap on the back, asked him if he thought he could behave himself if he\r\nlet him loose, and whether he would promise not to be going into the\r\ncabin again. To this, of course, my friend answered in the affirmative,\r\nwhen the ruffian set him at liberty, after making him drink from a\r\nflask of rum which he drew from his coat-pocket. Both now went on deck,\r\nand I did not see Augustus for about three hours. He then came below\r\nwith the good news that he had obtained permission to go about the brig\r\nas he pleased anywhere forward of the mainmast, and that he had been\r\nordered to sleep, as usual, in the forecastle. He brought me, too, a\r\ngood dinner, and a plentiful supply of water. The brig was still\r\ncruising for the vessel from the Cape Verds, and a sail was now in\r\nsight which was thought to be the one in question. As the events of the\r\nensuing eight days were of little importance, and had no direct bearing\r\nupon the main incidents of my narrative, I will here throw them into\r\nthe form of a journal, as I do not wish to omit them altogether.\r\n\r\n_July 3._ Augustus furnished me with three blankets, with which I\r\ncontrived a comfortable bed in my hiding-place. No one came below,\r\nexcept my companion, during the day. Tiger took his station in the\r\nberth just by the aperture, and slept heavily, as if not yet entirely\r\nrecovered from the effects of his sickness. Towards night a flaw of\r\nwind struck the brig before sail could be taken in, and very nearly\r\ncapsized her. The puff died away immediately, however, and no damage\r\nwas done beyond the splitting of the foretopsail. Dirk Peters treated\r\nAugustus all this day with great kindness, and entered into a long\r\nconversation with him respecting the Pacific Ocean, and the islands he\r\nhad visited in that region. He asked him whether he would not like to\r\ngo with the mutineers on a kind of exploring and pleasure voyage in\r\nthose quarters, and said that the men were gradually coming over to the\r\nmate\'s views. To this Augustus thought it best to reply that he would\r\nbe glad to go on such an adventure, since nothing better could be done,\r\nand that anything was preferable to a piratical life.\r\n\r\n_July 4th._ The vessel in sight proved to be a small brig from\r\nLiverpool, and was allowed to pass unmolested. Augustus spent most of\r\nhis time on deck, with a view of obtaining all the information in his\r\npower respecting the intentions of the mutineers. They had frequent and\r\nviolent quarrels among themselves, in one of which a harpooner, Jim\r\nBonner, was thrown overboard. The party of the mate was gaining ground.\r\nJim Bonner belonged to the cook\'s gang, of which Peters was a partisan.\r\n\r\n_July 5th._ About daybreak there came on a stiff breeze from the west,\r\nwhich at noon freshened into a gale, so that the brig could carry\r\nnothing more than her trysail and foresail. In taking in the\r\nforetopsail, Simms, one of the common hands, and belonging also to the\r\ncook\'s gang, fell overboard, being very much in liquor, and was\r\ndrowned--no attempt being made to save him. The whole number of persons\r\non board was now thirteen, to wit: Dirk Peters; Seymour, the black\r\ncook; ---- Jones; ---- Greely; Hartman Rogers; and William Allen, of\r\nthe cook\'s party; the mate, whose name I never learned; Absalom Hicks;\r\n---- Wilson; John Hunt; and Richard Parker, of the mate\'s\r\nparty--besides Augustus and myself.\r\n\r\n_July 6th._ The gale lasted all this day, blowing in heavy squalls,\r\naccompanied with rain. The brig took in a good deal of water through\r\nher seams, and one of the pumps was kept continually going, Augustus\r\nbeing forced to take his turn. Just at twilight a large ship passed\r\nclose by us, without having been discovered until within hail. This\r\nship was supposed to be the one for which the mutineers were on the\r\nlook-out. The mate hailed her, but the reply was drowned in the roaring\r\nof the gale. At eleven, a sea was shipped amid-ships, which tore away a\r\ngreat portion of the larboard bulwarks, and did some other slight\r\ndamage. Towards morning the weather moderated, and at sunrise there was\r\nvery little wind.\r\n\r\n_July 7th._ There was a heavy swell running all this day, during which\r\nthe brig, being light, rolled excessively, and many articles broke\r\nloose in the hold, as I could hear distinctly from my hiding-place. I\r\nsuffered a great deal from sea-sickness. Peters had a long conversation\r\nthis day with Augustus, and told him that two of his gang, Greely and\r\nAllen, had gone over to the mate, and were resolved to turn pirates. He\r\nput several questions to Augustus which he did not then exactly\r\nunderstand. During a part of this evening the leak gained upon the\r\nvessel; and little could be done to remedy it, as it was occasioned by\r\nthe brig\'s straining, and taking in the water through her seams. A sail\r\nwas thrummed, and got under the bows, which aided us in some measure,\r\nso that we began to gain upon the leak.\r\n\r\n_July 8th._ A light breeze sprung up at sunrise from the eastward, when\r\nthe mate headed the brig to the southwest, with the intention of making\r\nsome of the West India islands, in pursuance of his piratical designs.\r\nNo opposition was made by Peters or the cook; at least none in the\r\nhearing of Augustus. All idea of taking the vessel from the Cape Verds\r\nwas abandoned. The leak was now easily kept under by one pump going\r\nevery three quarters of an hour. The sail was drawn from beneath the\r\nbows. Spoke two small schooners during the day.\r\n\r\n_July 9th._ Fine weather. All hands employed in repairing bulwarks.\r\nPeters had again a long conversation with Augustus, and spoke more\r\nplainly than he had done heretofore. He said nothing should induce him\r\nto come into the mate\'s views, and even hinted his intention of taking\r\nthe brig out of his hands. He asked my friend if he could depend upon\r\nhis aid in such case, to which Augustus said, "Yes," without\r\nhesitation. Peters then said he would sound the others of his party\r\nupon the subject, and went away. During the remainder of the day\r\nAugustus had no opportunity of speaking with him privately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 10._ Spoke a brig from Rio, bound to Norfolk. Weather hazy, with\r\na light baffling wind from the eastward. To-day Hartman Rogers died,\r\nhaving been attacked on the eighth with spasms after drinking a glass\r\nof grog. This man was of the cook\'s party, and one upon whom Peters\r\nplaced his main reliance. He told Augustus that he believed the mate\r\nhad poisoned him, and that he expected, if he did not be on the\r\nlook-out, his own turn would come shortly. There were now only himself,\r\nJones, and the cook belonging to his own gang--on the other side there\r\nwere five. He had spoken to Jones about taking the command from the\r\nmate; but the project having been coolly received, he had been deterred\r\nfrom pressing the matter any further, or from saying anything to the\r\ncook. It was well, as it happened, that he was so prudent, for in the\r\nafternoon the cook expressed his determination of siding with the mate,\r\nand went over formally to that party; while Jones took an opportunity\r\nof quarrelling with Peters, and hinted that he would let the mate know\r\nof the plan in agitation. There was now, evidently, no time to be lost,\r\nand Peters expressed his determination of attempting to take the vessel\r\nat all hazards, provided Augustus would lend him his aid. My friend at\r\nonce assured him of his willingness to enter into any plan for that\r\npurpose, and, thinking the opportunity a favourable one, made known the\r\nfact of my being on board. At this the hybrid was not more astonished\r\nthan delighted, as he had no reliance whatever upon Jones, whom he\r\nalready considered as belonging to the party of the mate. They went\r\nbelow immediately, when Augustus called to me by name, and Peters and\r\nmyself were soon made acquainted. It was agreed that we should attempt\r\nto retake the vessel upon the first good opportunity, leaving Jones\r\naltogether out of our councils. In the event of success we were to run\r\nthe brig into the first port that offered, and deliver her up. The\r\ndesertion of his party had frustrated Peters\'s design of going into the\r\nPacific--an adventure which could not be accomplished without a crew,\r\nand he depended upon either getting acquitted upon trial on the score\r\nof insanity (which he solemnly averred had actuated him in lending his\r\naid to the mutiny), or upon obtaining a pardon, if found guilty,\r\nthrough the representations of Augustus and myself. Our deliberations\r\nwere interrupted for the present by the cry of "All hands take in\r\nsail," and Peters and Augustus ran up on deck.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the crew were nearly all drunk; and, before sail could be\r\nproperly taken in, a violent squall laid the brig on her beam-ends. By\r\nkeeping her away, however, she righted, having shipped a good deal of\r\nwater. Scarcely was everything secure, when another squall took the\r\nvessel, and immediately afterward another--no damage being done. There\r\nwas every appearance of a gale of wind, which, indeed, shortly came on,\r\nwith great fury, from the northward and westward. All was made as snug\r\nas possible, and we laid to, as usual, under a close-reefed foresail.\r\nAs night drew on, the wind increased in violence, with a remarkably\r\nheavy sea. Peters now came into the forecastle with Augustus, and we\r\nresumed our deliberations.\r\n\r\nWe agreed that no opportunity could be more favourable than the present\r\nfor carrying our design into effect, as an attempt at such a moment\r\nwould never be anticipated. As the brig was snugly laid to, there would\r\nbe no necessity of manoeuvring her until good weather, when, if we\r\nsucceeded in our attempt, we might liberate one, or perhaps two of the\r\nmen, to aid us in taking her into port. The main difficulty was the\r\ngreat disproportion in our forces. There were only three of us, and in\r\nthe cabin there were nine. All the arms on board, too, were in their\r\npossession, with the exception of a pair of small pistols which Peters\r\nhad concealed about his person, and the large seaman\'s knife which he\r\nalways wore in the waistband of his pantaloons. From certain\r\nindications, too, such, for example, as there being no such thing as an\r\naxe or a handspike lying in their customary places, we began to fear\r\nthat the mate had his suspicions, at least in regard to Peters, and\r\nthat he would let slip no opportunity of getting rid of him. It was\r\nclear, indeed, that what we should determine to do could not be done\r\ntoo soon. Still the odds were too much against us to allow of our\r\nproceeding without the greatest caution.\r\n\r\nPeters proposed that he should go up on deck, and enter into\r\nconversation with the watch (Allen), when he would be able to throw him\r\ninto the sea without trouble, and without making any disturbance, by\r\nseizing a good opportunity; that Augustus and myself should then come\r\nup, and endeavour to provide ourselves with some kind of weapons from\r\nthe deck; and that we should then make a rush together, and secure the\r\ncompanion-way before any opposition could be offered. I objected to\r\nthis, because I could not believe that the mate (who was a cunning\r\nfellow in all matters which did not affect his superstitious\r\nprejudices) would suffer himself to be so easily entrapped. The very\r\nfact of there being a watch on deck at all was sufficient proof that he\r\nwas upon the alert--it not being usual, except in vessels where\r\ndiscipline is most rigidly enforced, to station a watch on deck when a\r\nvessel is lying to in a gale of wind. As I address myself principally,\r\nif not altogether, to persons who have never been to sea, it may be as\r\nwell to state the exact condition of a vessel under such circumstances.\r\nLying to, or, in sea-parlance "laying to," is a measure resorted to for\r\nvarious purposes, and effected in various manners. In moderate weather,\r\nit is frequently done with a view of merely bringing the vessel to a\r\nstand-still, to wait for another vessel, or any similar object. If the\r\nvessel which lies to is under full sail, the manoeuvre is usually\r\naccomplished by throwing round some portion of her sails so as to let\r\nthe wind take them aback, when she becomes stationary. But we are now\r\nspeaking of lying to in a gale of wind. This is done when the wind is\r\nahead, and too violent to admit of carrying sail without danger of\r\ncapsizing; and sometimes even when the wind is fair, but the sea too\r\nheavy for the vessel to be put before it. If a vessel be suffered to\r\nscud before the wind in a very heavy sea, much damage is usually done\r\nher by the shipping of water over her stern, and sometimes by the\r\nviolent plunges she makes forward. This manoeuvre, then, is seldom\r\nresorted to in such case, unless through necessity. When the vessel is\r\nin a leaky condition, she is often put before the wind even in the\r\nheaviest seas; for, when lying to, her seams are sure to be greatly\r\nopened by her violent straining, and it is not so much the case when\r\nscudding. Often, too, it becomes necessary to scud a vessel, either\r\nwhen the blast is so exceedingly furious as to tear in pieces the sail\r\nwhich is employed with a view of bringing her head to the wind, or\r\nwhen, through the false modelling of the frame or other causes, this\r\nmain object cannot be effected.\r\n\r\nVessels in a gale of wind are laid to in different manners, according\r\nto their peculiar construction. Some lie to best under a foresail, and\r\nthis, I believe, is the sail most usually employed. Large square-rigged\r\nvessels have sails for the express purpose, called storm-staysails. But\r\nthe jib is occasionally employed by itself--sometimes the jib and\r\nforesail, or a double-reefed foresail, and not unfrequently the\r\nafter-sails, are made use of. Foretopsails are very often found to\r\nanswer the purpose better than any other species of sail. The Grampus\r\nwas generally laid to under a close-reefed foresail.\r\n\r\nWhen a vessel is to be laid to, her head is brought up to the wind just\r\nso nearly as to fill the sail under which she lies, when hauled flat\r\naft, that is, when brought diagonally across the vessel. This being\r\ndone, the bows point within a few degrees of the direction from which\r\nthe wind issues, and the windward bow of course receives the shock of\r\nthe waves. In this situation a good vessel will ride out a very heavy\r\ngale of wind without shipping a drop of water, and without any further\r\nattention being requisite on the part of the crew. The helm is usually\r\nlashed down, but this is altogether unnecessary (except on account of\r\nthe noise it makes when loose), for the rudder has no effect upon the\r\nvessel when lying to. Indeed, the helm had far better be left loose\r\nthan lashed very fast, for the rudder is apt to be torn off by heavy\r\nseas if there be no room for the helm to play. As long as the sail\r\nholds, a well-modelled vessel will maintain her situation, and ride\r\nevery sea, as if instinct with life and reason. If the violence of the\r\nwind, however, should tear the sail into pieces (a feat which it\r\nrequires a perfect hurricane to accomplish under ordinary\r\ncircumstances), there is then imminent danger. The vessel falls off\r\nfrom the wind, and, coming broadside to the sea, is completely at its\r\nmercy: the only resource in this case is to put her quickly before the\r\nwind, letting her scud until some other sail can be set. Some vessels\r\nwill lie to under no sail whatever, but such are not to be trusted at\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nBut to return from this digression. It had never been customary with\r\nthe mate to have any watch on deck when lying to in a gale of wind, and\r\nthe fact that he had now one, coupled with the circumstance of the\r\nmissing axes and handspikes, fully convinced us that the crew were too\r\nwell on the watch to be taken by surprise in the manner Peters had\r\nsuggested. Something, however, was to be done, and that with as little\r\ndelay as practicable, for there could be no doubt that a suspicion\r\nhaving been once entertained against Peters, he would be sacrificed\r\nupon the earliest occasion, and one would certainly be either found or\r\nmade upon the breaking of the gale.\r\n\r\nAugustus now suggested that if Peters could contrive to remove, under\r\nany pretext, the piece of chain-cable which lay over the trap in the\r\nstateroom, we might possibly be able to come upon them unawares by\r\nmeans of the hold; but a little reflection convinced us that the vessel\r\nrolled and pitched too violently for any attempt of that nature.\r\n\r\nBy good fortune I at length hit upon the idea of working upon the\r\nsuperstitious terrors and guilty conscience of the mate. It will be\r\nremembered that one of the crew, Hartman Rogers, had died during the\r\nmorning, having been attacked two days before with spasms after\r\ndrinking some spirits and water. Peters had expressed to us his opinion\r\nthat this man had been poisoned by the mate, and for this belief he had\r\nreasons, so he said, which were incontrovertible, but which he could\r\nnot be prevailed upon to explain to us--this wayward refusal being only\r\nin keeping with other points of his singular character. But whether or\r\nnot he had any better grounds for suspecting the mate than we had\r\nourselves, we were easily led to fall in with his suspicion, and\r\ndetermined to act accordingly.\r\n\r\nRogers had died about eleven in the forenoon, in violent convulsions;\r\nand the corpse presented in a few minutes after death one of the most\r\nhorrid and loathsome spectacles I ever remember to have seen. The\r\nstomach was swollen immensely, like that of a man who has been drowned\r\nand lain under water for many weeks. The hands were in the same\r\ncondition, while the face was shrunken, shrivelled, and of a chalky\r\nwhiteness, except where relieved by two or three glaring red splotches,\r\nlike those occasioned by the erysipelas: one of these splotches\r\nextended diagonally across the face, completely covering up an eye as\r\nif with a band of red velvet. In this disgusting condition the body had\r\nbeen brought up from the cabin at noon to be thrown overboard, when the\r\nmate getting a glimpse of it (for he now saw it for the first time),\r\nand being either touched with remorse for his crime or struck with\r\nterror at so horrible a sight, ordered the men to sew the body up in\r\nits hammock, and allow it the usual rites of sea-burial. Having given\r\nthese directions he went below, as if to avoid any further sight of his\r\nvictim. While preparations were making to obey his orders, the gale\r\ncame on with great fury, and the design was abandoned for the present.\r\nThe corpse, left to itself, was washed into the larboard scuppers,\r\nwhere it still lay at the time of which I speak, floundering about with\r\nthe furious lurches of the brig.\r\n\r\nHaving arranged our plan, we set about putting it in execution as\r\nspeedily as possible. Peters went upon deck, and, as he had\r\nanticipated, was immediately accosted by Allen, who appeared to be\r\nstationed more as a watch upon the forecastle than for any other\r\npurpose. The fate of this villain, however, was speedily and silently\r\ndecided; for Peters, approaching him in a careless manner, as if about\r\nto address him, seized him by the throat, and, before he could utter a\r\nsingle cry, tossed him over the bulwarks. He then called to us, and we\r\ncame up. Our first precaution was to look about for something with\r\nwhich to arm ourselves, and in doing this we had to proceed with great\r\ncare, for it was impossible to stand on deck an instant without holding\r\nfast, and violent seas broke over the vessel at every plunge forward.\r\nIt was indispensable, too, that we should be quick in our operations,\r\nfor every minute we expected the mate to be up to set the pumps going,\r\nas it was evident the brig must be taking in water very fast. After\r\nsearching about for some time, we could find nothing more fit for our\r\npurpose than the two pump-handles, one of which Augustus took, and I\r\nthe other. Having secured these, we stripped off the shirt of the\r\ncorpse and dropped the body overboard. Peters and myself then went\r\nbelow, leaving Augustus to watch upon deck, where he took his station\r\njust where Allen had been placed, and with his back to the cabin\r\ncompanion-way, so that, if any one of the mate\'s gang should come up,\r\nhe might suppose it was the watch.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I got below I commenced disguising myself so as to represent\r\nthe corpse of Rogers. The shirt which we had taken from the body aided\r\nus very much, for it was of a singular form and character, and easily\r\nrecognisable--a kind of smock, which the deceased wore over his other\r\nclothing. It was a blue stockinett, with large white stripes running\r\nacross. Having put this on, I proceeded to equip myself with a false\r\nstomach, in imitation of the horrible deformity of the swollen corpse.\r\nThis was soon effected by means of stuffing with some bedclothes. I\r\nthen gave the same appearance to my hands by drawing on a pair of white\r\nwoollen mittens, and filling them in with any kind of rags that offered\r\nthemselves. Peters then arranged my face, first rubbing it well over\r\nwith white chalk, and afterward splotching it with blood, which he took\r\nfrom a cut in his finger. The streak across the eye was not forgotten,\r\nand presented a most shocking appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I viewed myself in a fragment of looking-glass which hung up in the\r\ncabin, and by the dim light of a kind of battle-lantern, I was so\r\nimpressed with a sense of vague awe at my appearance, and at the\r\nrecollection of the terrific reality which I was thus representing,\r\nthat I was seized with a violent tremour, and could scarcely summon\r\nresolution to go on with my part. It was necessary, however, to act\r\nwith decision, and Peters and myself went upon deck.\r\n\r\nWe there found everything safe, and, keeping close to the bulwarks, the\r\nthree of us crept to the cabin companion-way. It was only partially\r\nclosed, precautions having been taken to prevent its being suddenly\r\npushed to from without, by means of placing billets of wood on the\r\nupper step so as to interfere with the shutting. We found no difficulty\r\nin getting a full view of the interior of the cabin through the cracks\r\nwhere the hinges were placed. It now proved to have been very fortunate\r\nfor us that we had not attempted to take them by surprise, for they\r\nwere evidently on the alert. Only one was asleep, and he lying just at\r\nthe foot of the companion-ladder, with a musket by his side. The rest\r\nwere seated on several mattresses, which had been taken from the berths\r\nand thrown on the floor. They were engaged in earnest conversation; and\r\nalthough they had been carousing, as appeared from two empty jugs, with\r\nsome tin tumblers which lay about, they were not as much intoxicated as\r\nusual. All had knives, one or two of them pistols, and a great many\r\nmuskets were lying in a berth close at hand.\r\n\r\nWe listened to their conversation for some time before we could make up\r\nour minds how to act, having as yet resolved on nothing determinate,\r\nexcept that we would attempt to paralyze their exertions, when we\r\nshould attack them, by means of the apparition of Rogers. They were\r\ndiscussing their piratical plans, in which all we could hear distinctly\r\nwas, that they would unite with the crew of a schooner Hornet, and, if\r\npossible, get the schooner herself into their possession preparatory to\r\nsome attempt on a large scale, the particulars of which could not be\r\nmade out by either of us.\r\n\r\nOne of the men spoke of Peters, when the mate replied to him in a low\r\nvoice which could not be distinguished, and afterward added more\r\nloudly, that "he could not understand his being so much forward with\r\nthe captain\'s brat in the forecastle, and he thought the sooner both of\r\nthem were overboard the better." To this no answer was made, but we\r\ncould easily perceive that the hint was well received by the whole\r\nparty, and more particularly by Jones. At this period I was excessively\r\nagitated, the more so as I could see that neither Augustus nor Peters\r\ncould determine how to act. I made up my mind, however, to sell my life\r\nas dearly as possible, and not to suffer myself to be overcome by any\r\nfeelings of trepidation.\r\n\r\nThe tremendous noise made by the roaring of the wind in the rigging and\r\nthe washing of the sea over the deck prevented us from hearing what was\r\nsaid except during momentary lulls. In one of these we all distinctly\r\nheard the mate tell one of the men to "go forward, and order the d----d\r\nlubbers to come into the cabin, where he could have an eye upon them,\r\nfor he wanted no such secret doings on board the brig." It was well for\r\nus that the pitching of the vessel at this moment was so violent as to\r\nprevent this order from being carried into instant execution. The cook\r\ngot up from his mattress to go for us, when a tremendous lurch, which I\r\nthought would carry away the masts, threw him headlong against one of\r\nthe larboard stateroom doors, bursting it open, and creating a good\r\ndeal of other confusion. Luckily, neither of our party was thrown from\r\nhis position, and we had time to make a precipitate retreat to the\r\nforecastle, and arrange a hurried plan of action before the messenger\r\nmade his appearance, or rather before he put his head out of the\r\ncompanion-hatch, for he did not come on deck. From this station he\r\ncould not notice the absence of Allen, and he accordingly bawled out as\r\nif to him, repeating the orders of the mate. Peters cried out, "Ay,\r\nay," in a disguised voice, and the cook immediately went below, without\r\nentertaining a suspicion that all was not right.\r\n\r\nMy two companions now proceeded boldly aft and down into the cabin,\r\nPeters closing the door after him in the same manner he had found it.\r\nThe mate received them with feigned cordiality, and told Augustus that,\r\nsince he had behaved himself so well of late, he might take up his\r\nquarters in the cabin, and be one of them for the future. He then\r\npoured him out a tumbler half full of rum, and made him drink it. All\r\nthis I saw and heard, for I followed my friends to the cabin as soon as\r\nthe door was shut, and took up my old point of observation. I had\r\nbrought with me the two pump-handles, one of which I secured near the\r\ncompanion-way, to be ready for use when required.\r\n\r\nI now steadied myself as well as possible so as to have a good view of\r\nall that was passing within, and endeavoured to nerve myself to the\r\ntask of descending among the mutineers when Peters should make a signal\r\nto me as agreed upon. Presently he contrived to turn the conversation\r\nupon the bloody deeds of the mutiny, and, by degrees, led the men to\r\ntalk of the thousand superstitions which are so universally current\r\namong seamen. I could not make out all that was said, but I could\r\nplainly see the effects of the conversation in the countenances of\r\nthose present. The mate was evidently much agitated, and presently,\r\nwhen some one mentioned the terrific appearance of Rogers\'s corpse, I\r\nthought he was upon the point of swooning. Peters now asked him if he\r\ndid not think it would be better to have the body thrown overboard at\r\nonce, as it was too horrible a sight to see it floundering about in the\r\nscuppers. At this the villain absolutely gasped for breath, and turned\r\nhis head slowly round upon his companions, as if imploring some one to\r\ngo up and perform the task. No one, however, stirred, and it was quite\r\nevident that the whole party were wound up to the highest pitch of\r\nnervous excitement. Peters now made me the signal. I immediately threw\r\nopen the door of the companion-way, and, descending without uttering a\r\nsyllable, stood erect in the midst of the party.\r\n\r\nThe intense effect produced by this sudden apparition is not at all to\r\nbe wondered at when the various circumstances are taken into\r\nconsideration. Usually, in cases of a similar nature, there is left in\r\nthe mind of the spectator some glimmering of doubt as to the reality of\r\nthe vision before his eyes; a degree of hope, however feeble, that he\r\nis the victim of chicanery, and that the apparition is not actually a\r\nvisitant from the world of shadows. It is not too much to say that such\r\nremnants of doubt have been at the bottom of almost every such\r\nvisitation, and that the appalling horror which has sometimes been\r\nbrought about, is to be attributed, even in the cases most in point,\r\nand where most suffering has been experienced, more to a kind of\r\nanticipative horror, lest the apparition _might possibly be_ real, than\r\nto an unwavering belief in its reality. But, in the present instance,\r\nit will be seen immediately, that in the minds of the mutineers there\r\nwas not even the shadow of a basis upon which to rest a doubt that the\r\napparition of Rogers was indeed a revivification of his disgusting\r\ncorpse, or at least its spiritual image. The isolated situation of the\r\nbrig, with its entire inaccessibility on account of the gale, confined\r\nthe apparently possible means of deception within such narrow and\r\ndefinite limits, that they must have thought themselves enabled to\r\nsurvey them all at a glance. They had now been at sea twenty-four days,\r\nwithout holding more than a speaking communication with any vessel\r\nwhatever. The whole of the crew, too, at least all whom they had the\r\nmost remote reason for suspecting to be on board, were assembled in the\r\ncabin, with the exception of Allen, the watch; and his gigantic stature\r\n(he was six feet six inches high) was too familiar in their eyes to\r\npermit the notion that he was the apparition before them to enter their\r\nminds even for an instant. Add to these considerations the\r\nawe-inspiring nature of the tempest, and that of the conversation\r\nbrought about by Peters; the deep impression which the loathsomeness of\r\nthe actual corpse had made in the morning upon the imaginations of the\r\nmen; the excellence of the imitation in my person; and the uncertain\r\nand wavering light in which they beheld me, as the glare of the cabin\r\nlantern, swinging violently to and fro, fell dubiously and fitfully\r\nupon my figure, and there will be no reason to wonder that the\r\ndeception had even more than the entire effect which we had\r\nanticipated. The mate sprang up from the mattress on which he was\r\nlying, and, without uttering a syllable, fell back, stone dead, upon\r\nthe cabin floor, and was hurled to the leeward like a log by a heavy\r\nroll of the brig. Of the remaining seven there were but three who had\r\nat first any degree of presence of mind. The four others sat for some\r\ntime rooted apparently to the floor, the most pitiable objects of\r\nhorror and utter despair my eyes ever encountered. The only opposition\r\nwe experienced at all was from the cook, John Hunt, and Richard Parker;\r\nbut they made but a feeble and irresolute defence. The two former were\r\nshot instantly by Peters, and I felled Parker with a blow on the head\r\nfrom the pump-handle which I had brought with me. In the mean time\r\nAugustus seized one of the muskets lying on the floor, and shot another\r\nmutineer (---- Wilson) through the breast. There were now but three\r\nremaining; but by this time they had become aroused from their\r\nlethargy, and perhaps began to see that a deception had been practised\r\nupon them, for they fought with great resolution and fury, and, but for\r\nthe immense muscular strength of Peters, might have ultimately got the\r\nbetter of us. These three men were ---- Jones, ---- Greely, and Absalom\r\nHicks. Jones had thrown Augustus on the floor, stabbed him in several\r\nplaces along the right arm, and would no doubt have soon despatched him\r\n(as neither Peters nor myself could immediately get rid of our own\r\nantagonists), had it not been for the timely aid of a friend upon whose\r\nassistance we surely had never depended. This friend was no other than\r\nTiger. With a low growl he bounded into the cabin, at a most critical\r\nmoment for Augustus, and throwing himself upon Jones, pinned him to the\r\nfloor in an instant. My friend, however, was now too much injured to\r\nrender us any aid whatever, and I was so encumbered with my disguise\r\nthat I could do but little. The dog would not leave his hold upon the\r\nthroat of Jones--Peters, nevertheless, was far more than a match for\r\nthe two men who remained, and would, no doubt, have despatched them\r\nsooner, had it not been for the narrow space in which he had to act,\r\nand the tremendous lurches of the vessel. Presently he was enabled to\r\nget hold of a heavy stool, several of which lay about the floor. With\r\nthis he beat out the brains of Greely as he was in the act of\r\ndischarging a musket at me, and immediately afterward a roll of the\r\nbrig throwing him in contact with Hicks, he seized him by the throat,\r\nand, by dint of sheer strength, strangled him instantaneously. Thus, in\r\nfar less time than I have taken to tell it, we found ourselves masters\r\nof the brig.\r\n\r\nThe only person of our opponents who was left alive was Richard Parker.\r\nThis man, it will be remembered, I had knocked down with a blow from\r\nthe pump-handle at the commencement of the attack. He now lay\r\nmotionless by the door of the shattered stateroom; but, upon Peters\r\ntouching him with his foot, he spoke, and entreated for mercy. His head\r\nwas only slightly cut, and otherwise he had received no injury, having\r\nbeen merely stunned by the blow. He now got up, and, for the present,\r\nwe secured his hands behind his back. The dog was still growling over\r\nJones; but, upon examination, we found him completely dead, the blood\r\nissuing in a stream from a deep wound in the throat, inflicted, no\r\ndoubt, by the sharp teeth of the animal.\r\n\r\nIt was now about one o\'clock in the morning, and the wind was still\r\nblowing tremendously. The brig evidently laboured much more than usual,\r\nand it became absolutely necessary that something should be done with a\r\nview of easing her in some measure. At almost every roll to leeward she\r\nshipped a sea, several of which came partially down into the cabin\r\nduring our scuffle, the hatchway having been left open by myself when I\r\ndescended. The entire range of bulwarks to larboard had been swept\r\naway, as well as the caboose, together with the jollyboat from the\r\ncounter. The creaking and working of the mainmast, too, gave indication\r\nthat it was nearly sprung. To make room for more stowage in the after\r\nhold, the heel of this mast had been stepped between decks (a very\r\nreprehensible practice, occasionally resorted to by ignorant\r\nship-builders), so that it was in imminent danger of working from its\r\nstep. But, to crown all our difficulties, we plummed the well, and\r\nfound no less than seven feet water.\r\n\r\nLeaving the bodies of the crew lying in the cabin, we got to work\r\nimmediately at the pumps--Parker, of course, being set at liberty to\r\nassist us in the labour. Augustus\'s arm was bound up as well as we\r\ncould effect it, and he did what he could, but that was not much.\r\nHowever, we found that we could just manage to keep the leak from\r\ngaining upon us by having one pump constantly going. As there were only\r\nfour of us, this was severe labour; but we endeavoured to keep up our\r\nspirits, and looked anxiously for daybreak, when we hoped to lighten\r\nthe brig by cutting away the mainmast.\r\n\r\nIn this manner we passed a night of terrible anxiety and fatigue, and,\r\nwhen the day at length broke, the gale had neither abated in the least,\r\nnor were there any signs of its abating. We now dragged the bodies on\r\ndeck and threw them overboard. Our next care was to get rid of the\r\nmainmast. The necessary preparations having been made, Peters cut away\r\nat the mast (having found axes in the cabin), while the rest of us\r\nstood by the stays and lanyards. As the brig gave a tremendous\r\nlee-lurch, the word was given to cut away the weather-lanyards, which\r\nbeing done, the whole mass of wood and rigging plunged into the sea,\r\nclear of the brig, and without doing any material injury. We now found\r\nthat the vessel did not labour quite as much as before, but our\r\nsituation was still exceedingly precarious, and, in spite of the utmost\r\nexertions, we could not gain upon the leak without the aid of both\r\npumps. The little assistance which Augustus could render us was not\r\nreally of any importance. To add to our distress, a heavy sea, striking\r\nthe brig to windward, threw her off several points from the wind, and,\r\nbefore she could regain her position, another broke completely over\r\nher, and hurled her full upon her beam-ends. The ballast now shifted in\r\na mass to leeward (the stowage had been knocking about perfectly at\r\nrandom for some time), and for a few moments we thought nothing could\r\nsave us from capsizing. Presently, however, we partially righted; but\r\nthe ballast still retaining its place to larboard, we lay so much along\r\nthat it was useless to think of working the pumps, which indeed we\r\ncould not have done much longer in any case, as our hands were entirely\r\nraw with the excessive labour we had undergone, and were bleeding in\r\nthe most horrible manner.\r\n\r\nContrary to Parker\'s advice, we now proceeded to cut away the foremast,\r\nand at length accomplished it after much difficulty, owing to the\r\nposition in which we lay. In going overboard the wreck took with it the\r\nbowsprit, and left us a complete hulk.\r\n\r\nSo far we had had reason to rejoice in the escape of our longboat,\r\nwhich had received no damage from any of the huge seas which had come\r\non board. But we had not long to congratulate ourselves; for the\r\nforemast having gone, and, of course, the foresail with it, by which\r\nthe brig had been steadied, every sea now made a complete breach over\r\nus, and in five minutes our deck was swept from stem to stern, the\r\nlongboat and starboard bulwarks torn off, and even the windlass\r\nshattered into fragments. It was, indeed, hardly possible for us to be\r\nin a more pitiable condition.\r\n\r\nAt noon there seemed to be some slight appearance of the gale\'s\r\nabating, but in this we were sadly disappointed, for it only lulled for\r\na few minutes to blow with redoubled fury. About four in the afternoon\r\nit was utterly impossible to stand up against the violence of the\r\nblast; and, as the night closed in upon us, I had not a shadow of hope\r\nthat the vessel would hold together until morning.\r\n\r\nBy midnight we had settled very deep in the water, which was now up to\r\nthe orlop deck. The rudder went soon afterward, the sea which tore it\r\naway lifting the after portion of the brig entirely from the water,\r\nagainst which she thumped in her descent with such a concussion as\r\nwould be occasioned by going ashore. We had all calculated that the\r\nrudder would hold its own to the last, as it was unusually strong,\r\nbeing rigged as I have never seen one rigged either before or since.\r\nDown its main timber there ran a succession of stout iron hooks, and\r\nothers in the same manner down the stern-post. Through these hooks\r\nthere extended a very thick wrought-iron rod, the rudder being thus\r\nheld to the stern-post, and swinging freely on the rod. The tremendous\r\nforce of the sea which tore it off may be estimated by the fact, that\r\nthe hooks in the stern-post, which ran entirely through it, being\r\nclinched on the inside, were drawn every one of them completely out of\r\nthe solid wood.\r\n\r\nWe had scarcely time to draw breath after the violence of this shock,\r\nwhen one of the most tremendous waves I had then ever known broke right\r\non board of us, sweeping the companion-way clear off, bursting in the\r\nhatchways, and filling every inch of the vessel with water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nLuckily, just before night, all four of us had lashed ourselves firmly\r\nto the fragments of the windlass, lying in this manner as flat upon the\r\ndeck as possible. This precaution alone saved us from destruction. As\r\nit was, we were all more or less stunned by the immense weight of water\r\nwhich tumbled upon us, and which did not roll from above us until we\r\nwere nearly exhausted. As soon as I could recover breath, I called\r\naloud to my companions. Augustus alone replied, saying, "It is all over\r\nwith us, and may God have mercy upon our souls." By-and-by both the\r\nothers were enabled to speak, when they exhorted us to take courage, as\r\nthere was still hope; it being impossible, from the nature of the\r\ncargo, that the brig could go down, and there being every chance that\r\nthe gale would blow over by the morning. These words inspired me with\r\nnew life; for, strange as it may seem, although it was obvious that a\r\nvessel with a cargo of empty oil-casks would not sink, I had been\r\nhitherto so confused in mind as to have overlooked this consideration\r\naltogether; and the danger which I had for some time regarded as the\r\nmost imminent was that of foundering. As hope revived within me, I made\r\nuse of every opportunity to strengthen the lashings which held me to\r\nthe remains of the windlass, and in this occupation I soon discovered\r\nthat my companions were also busy. The night was as dark as it could\r\npossibly be, and the horrible shrieking din and confusion which\r\nsurrounded us it is useless to attempt describing. Our deck lay level\r\nwith the sea, or rather we were encircled with a towering ridge of\r\nfoam, a portion of which swept over us every instant. It is not too\r\nmuch to say that our heads were not fairly out of water more than one\r\nsecond in three. Although we lay close together, no one of us could see\r\nthe other, or, indeed, any portion of the brig itself, upon which we\r\nwere so tempestuously hurled about. At intervals we called one to the\r\nother, thus endeavouring to keep alive hope, and render consolation and\r\nencouragement to such of us as stood most in need of it. The feeble\r\ncondition of Augustus made him an object of solicitude with us all; and\r\nas, from the lacerated condition of his right arm, it must have been\r\nimpossible for him to secure his lashings with any degree of firmness,\r\nwe were in momentary expectation of finding that he had gone\r\noverboard--yet to render him aid was a thing altogether out of the\r\nquestion. Fortunately, his station was more secure than that of any of\r\nthe rest of us; for the upper part of his body lying just beneath a\r\nportion of the shattered windlass, the seas, as they tumbled in upon\r\nhim, were greatly broken in their violence. In any other situation than\r\nthis (into which he had been accidentally thrown after having lashed\r\nhimself in a very exposed spot) he must inevitably have perished before\r\nmorning. Owing to the brig\'s lying so much along, we were all less\r\nliable to be washed off than otherwise would have been the case. The\r\nheel, as I have before stated, was to larboard, about one half of the\r\ndeck being constantly under water. The seas, therefore, which struck us\r\nto starboard were much broken by the vessel\'s side, only reaching us in\r\nfragments as we lay flat on our faces; while those which came from\r\nlarboard, being what are called back-water seas, and obtaining little\r\nhold upon us on account of our posture, had not sufficient force to\r\ndrag us from our fastenings.\r\n\r\nIn this frightful situation we lay until the day broke so as to show us\r\nmore fully the horrors which surrounded us. The brig was a mere log,\r\nrolling about at the mercy of every wave; the gale was upon the\r\nincrease, if anything, blowing indeed a complete hurricane, and there\r\nappeared to us no earthly prospect of deliverance. For several hours we\r\nheld on in silence, expecting every moment that our lashings would\r\neither give way, that the remains of the windlass would go by the\r\nboard, or that some of the huge seas, which roared in every direction\r\naround us and above us, would drive the hulk so far beneath the water\r\nthat we should be drowned before it could regain the surface. By the\r\nmercy of God, however, we were preserved from these imminent dangers,\r\nand about midday were cheered by the light of the blessed sun. Shortly\r\nafterward we could perceive a sensible diminution in the force of the\r\nwind, when, now for the first time since the latter part of the evening\r\nbefore, Augustus spoke, asking Peters, who lay closest to him, if he\r\nthought there was any possibility of our being saved. As no reply was\r\nat first made to this question, we all concluded that the hybrid had\r\nbeen drowned where he lay; but presently, to our great joy, he spoke,\r\nalthough very feebly, saying that he was in great pain, being so cut by\r\nthe tightness of his lashings across the stomach, that he must either\r\nfind means of loosening them or perish, as it was impossible that he\r\ncould endure his misery much longer. This occasioned us great distress,\r\nas it was altogether useless to think of aiding him in any manner while\r\nthe sea continued washing over us as it did. We exhorted him to bear\r\nhis sufferings with fortitude, and promised to seize the first\r\nopportunity which should offer itself to relieve him. He replied that\r\nit would soon be too late; that it would be all over with him before we\r\ncould help him; and then, after moaning for some minutes, lay silent,\r\nwhen we concluded that he had perished.\r\n\r\nAs the evening drew on, the sea had fallen so much that scarcely more\r\nthan one wave broke over the hulk from windward in the course of five\r\nminutes, and the wind had abated a great deal, although still blowing a\r\nsevere gale. I had not heard any of my companions speak for hours, and\r\nnow called to Augustus. He replied, although very feebly, so that I\r\ncould not distinguish what he said. I then spoke to Peters and to\r\nParker, neither of whom returned any answer.\r\n\r\nShortly after this period I fell into a state of partial insensibility,\r\nduring which the most pleasing images floated in my imagination; such\r\nas green trees, waving meadows of ripe grain, processions of dancing\r\ngirls, troops of cavalry, and other phantasies. I now remember that, in\r\nall which passed before my mind\'s eye, _motion_ was a predominant idea.\r\nThus, I never fancied any stationary object, such as a house, a\r\nmountain, or anything of that kind; but windmills, ships, large birds,\r\nballoons, people on horseback, carriages driving furiously, and similar\r\nmoving objects, presented themselves in endless succession. When I\r\nrecovered from this state, the sun was, as near as I could guess, an\r\nhour high. I had the greatest difficulty in bringing to recollection\r\nthe various circumstances connected with my situation, and for some\r\ntime remained firmly convinced that I was still in the hold of the\r\nbrig, near the box, and that the body of Parker was that of Tiger.\r\n\r\nWhen I at length completely came to my senses, I found that the wind\r\nblew no more than a moderate breeze, and that the sea was comparatively\r\ncalm; so much so that it only washed over the brig amidships. My left\r\narm had broken loose from its lashings, and was much cut about the\r\nelbow; my right was entirely benumbed, and the hand and wrist swollen\r\nprodigiously by the pressure of the rope, which had worked from the\r\nshoulder downward. I was also in great pain from another rope which\r\nwent about my waist, and had been drawn to an insufferable degree of\r\ntightness. Looking round upon my companions, I saw that Peters still\r\nlived, although a thick line was pulled so forcibly around his loins as\r\nto give him the appearance of being cut nearly in two; as I stirred, he\r\nmade a feeble motion to me with his hand, pointing to the rope.\r\nAugustus gave no indication of life whatever, and was bent nearly\r\ndouble across a splinter of the windlass. Parker spoke to me when he\r\nsaw me moving, and asked me if I had not sufficient strength to release\r\nhim from his situation; saying, that if I would summon up what spirits\r\nI could, and contrive to untie him, we might yet save our lives; but\r\nthat otherwise we must all perish. I told him to take courage, and I\r\nwould endeavour to free him. Feeling in my pantaloons\' pocket, I got\r\nhold of my penknife, and, after several ineffectual attempts, at length\r\nsucceeded in opening it. I then, with my left hand, managed to free my\r\nright from its fastenings, and afterward cut the other ropes which held\r\nme. Upon attempting, however, to move from my position, I found that my\r\nlegs failed me altogether, and that I could not get up; neither could I\r\nmove my right arm in any direction. Upon mentioning this to Parker, he\r\nadvised me to lie quiet for a few minutes, holding on to the windlass\r\nwith my left hand, so as to allow time for the blood to circulate.\r\nDoing this, the numbness presently began to die away, so that I could\r\nmove first one of my legs, and then the other; and, shortly afterward,\r\nI regained the partial use of my right arm. I now crawled with great\r\ncaution towards Parker, without getting on my legs, and soon cut loose\r\nall the lashings about him, when, after a short delay, he also\r\nrecovered the partial use of his limbs. We now lost no time in getting\r\nloose the rope from Peters. It had cut a deep gash through the\r\nwaistband of his woollen pantaloons, and through two shirts, and made\r\nits way into his groin, from which the blood flowed out copiously as we\r\nremoved the cordage. No sooner had we removed it, however, than he\r\nspoke, and seemed to experience instant relief--being able to move with\r\nmuch greater ease than either Parker or myself--this was no doubt owing\r\nto the discharge of blood.\r\n\r\nWe had little hope that Augustus would recover, as he evinced no signs\r\nof life; but, upon getting to him, we discovered that he had merely\r\nswooned from loss of blood, the bandages we had placed around his\r\nwounded arm having been torn off by the water; none of the ropes which\r\nheld him to the windlass were drawn sufficiently tight to occasion his\r\ndeath. Having relieved him from the fastenings, and got him clear of\r\nthe broken wood about the windlass, we secured him in a dry place to\r\nwindward, with his head somewhat lower than his body, and all three of\r\nus busied ourselves in chafing his limbs. In about half an hour he came\r\nto himself, although it was not until the next morning that he gave\r\nsigns of recognising any of us, or had sufficient strength to speak. By\r\nthe time we had thus got clear of our lashings it was quite dark, and\r\nit began to cloud up, so that we were again in the greatest agony lest\r\nit should come on to blow hard, in which event nothing could have saved\r\nus from perishing, exhausted as we were. By good fortune it continued\r\nvery moderate during the night, the sea subsiding every minute, which\r\ngave us great hopes of ultimate preservation. A gentle breeze still\r\nblew from the N. W., but the weather was not at all cold. Augustus was\r\nlashed carefully to windward in such a manner as to prevent him from\r\nslipping overboard with the rolls of the vessel, as he was still too\r\nweak to hold on at all. For ourselves there was no such necessity. We\r\nsat close together, supporting each other with the aid of the broken\r\nropes about the windlass, and devising methods of escape from our\r\nfrightful situation. We derived much comfort from taking off our\r\nclothes and wringing the water from them. When we put them on after\r\nthis, they felt remarkably warm and pleasant, and served to invigorate\r\nus in no little degree. We helped Augustus off with his, and wrung them\r\nfor him, when he experienced the same comfort.\r\n\r\nOur chief sufferings were now those of hunger and thirst, and, when we\r\nlooked forward to the means of relief in this respect, our hearts sunk\r\nwithin us, and we were induced to regret that we had escaped the less\r\ndreadful perils of the sea. We endeavoured, however, to console\r\nourselves with the hope of being speedily picked up by some vessel, and\r\nencouraged each other to bear with fortitude the evils that might\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the fourteenth at length dawned, and the weather still\r\ncontinued clear and pleasant, with a steady but very light breeze from\r\nthe N. W. The sea was now quite smooth, and as, from some cause which\r\nwe could not determine, the brig did not lie so much along as she had\r\ndone before, the deck was comparatively dry, and we could move about\r\nwith freedom. We had now been better than three entire days and nights\r\nwithout either food or drink, and it became absolutely necessary that\r\nwe should make an attempt to get up something from below. As the brig\r\nwas completely full of water, we went to this work despondingly, and\r\nwith but little expectation of being able to obtain anything. We made a\r\nkind of drag by driving some nails which we broke out from the remains\r\nof the companion-hatch into two pieces of wood. Tying these across each\r\nother, and fastening them to the end of a rope, we threw them into the\r\ncabin, and dragged them to and fro, in the faint hope of being thus\r\nable to entangle some article which might be of use to us for food, or\r\nwhich might at least render us assistance in getting it. We spent the\r\ngreater part of the morning in this labour without effect, fishing up\r\nnothing more than a few bedclothes, which were readily caught by the\r\nnails. Indeed, our contrivance was so very clumsy, that any greater\r\nsuccess was hardly to be anticipated.\r\n\r\nWe now tried the forecastle, but equally in vain, and were upon the\r\nbrink of despair, when Peters proposed that we should fasten a rope to\r\nhis body, and let him make an attempt to get up something by diving\r\ninto the cabin. This proposition we hailed with all the delight which\r\nreviving hope could inspire. He proceeded immediately to strip off his\r\nclothes with the exception of his pantaloons; and a strong rope was\r\nthen carefully fastened around his middle, being brought up over his\r\nshoulders in such a manner that there was no possibility of its\r\nslipping. The undertaking was one of great difficulty and danger; for,\r\nas we could hardly expect to find much, if any provision in the cabin\r\nitself, it was necessary that the diver, after letting himself down,\r\nshould make a turn to the right, and proceed under water a distance of\r\nten or twelve feet, in a narrow passage, to the storeroom, and return,\r\nwithout drawing breath.\r\n\r\nEverything being ready, Peters now descended into the cabin, going down\r\nthe companion-ladder until the water reached his chin. He then plunged\r\nin, head first, turning to the right as he plunged, and endeavouring to\r\nmake his way to the storeroom. In this first attempt, however, he was\r\naltogether unsuccessful. In less than half a minute after his going\r\ndown we felt the rope jerked violently (the signal we had agreed upon\r\nwhen he desired to be drawn up). We accordingly drew him up instantly,\r\nbut so incautiously as to bruise him badly against the ladder. He had\r\nbrought nothing with him, and had been unable to penetrate more than a\r\nvery little way into the passage, owing to the constant exertions he\r\nfound it necessary to make in order to keep himself from floating up\r\nagainst the deck. Upon getting out he was very much exhausted, and had\r\nto rest full fifteen minutes before he could again venture to descend.\r\n\r\nThe second attempt met with even worse success; for he remained so long\r\nunder water without giving the signal, that, becoming alarmed for his\r\nsafety, we drew him out without it, and found that he was almost at the\r\nlast gasp, having, as he said, repeatedly jerked at the rope without\r\nour feeling it. This was probably owing to a portion of it having\r\nbecome entangled in the balustrade at the foot of the ladder. This\r\nbalustrade was, indeed, so much in the way, that we determined to\r\nremove it, if possible, before proceeding with our design. As we had no\r\nmeans of getting it away except by main force, we all descended into\r\nthe water as far as we could on the ladder, and, giving a pull against\r\nit with our united strength, succeeded in breaking it down.\r\n\r\nThe third attempt was equally unsuccessful with the two first, and it\r\nnow became evident that nothing could be done in this manner without\r\nthe aid of some weight with which the diver might steady himself, and\r\nkeep to the floor of the cabin while making his search. For a long time\r\nwe looked about in vain for something which might answer this purpose;\r\nbut at length, to our great joy, we discovered one of the\r\nweather-forechains so loose that we had not the least difficulty in\r\nwrenching it off. Having fastened this securely to one of his ancles,\r\nPeters now made his fourth descent into the cabin, and this time\r\nsucceeded in making his way to the door of the steward\'s room. To his\r\ninexpressible grief, however, he found it locked, and was obliged to\r\nreturn without effecting an entrance, as, with the greatest exertion,\r\nhe could remain under water not more, at the utmost extent, than a\r\nsingle minute. Our affairs now looked gloomy indeed, and neither\r\nAugustus nor myself could refrain from bursting into tears, as we\r\nthought of the host of difficulties which encompassed us, and the\r\nslight probability which existed of our finally making an escape. But\r\nthis weakness was not of long duration. Throwing ourselves on our knees\r\nto God, we implored his aid in the many dangers which beset us; and\r\narose with renewed hope and vigour to think what could yet be done by\r\nmortal means towards accomplishing our deliverance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly afterward an incident occurred which I am induced to look upon\r\nas more intensely productive of emotion, as far more replete with the\r\nextremes first of delight and then of horror, than even any of the\r\nthousand chances which afterward befell me in nine long years, crowded\r\nwith events of the most startling, and, in many cases, of the most\r\nunconceived and unconceivable character. We were lying on the deck near\r\nthe companion-way, and debating the possibility of yet making our way\r\ninto the storeroom, when, looking towards Augustus, who lay fronting\r\nmyself, I perceived that he had become all at once deadly pale, and\r\nthat his lips were quivering in the most singular and unaccountable\r\nmanner. Greatly alarmed, I spoke to him, but he made me no reply, and I\r\nwas beginning to think that he was suddenly taken ill, when I took\r\nnotice of his eyes, which were glaring apparently at some object behind\r\nme. I turned my head, and shall never forget the ecstatic joy which\r\nthrilled through every particle of my frame, when I perceived a large\r\nbrig bearing down upon us, and not more than a couple of miles off. I\r\nsprung to my feet as if a musket bullet had suddenly struck me to the\r\nheart; and, stretching out my arms in the direction of the vessel,\r\nstood in this manner, motionless, and unable to articulate a syllable.\r\nPeters and Parker were equally affected, although in different ways.\r\nThe former danced about the deck like a madman, uttering the most\r\nextravagant rhodomontades, intermingled with howls and imprecations,\r\nwhile the latter burst into tears, and continued for many minutes\r\nweeping like a child.\r\n\r\nThe vessel in sight was a large hermaphrodite brig, of a Dutch build,\r\nand painted black, with a tawdry gilt figurehead. She had evidently\r\nseen a good deal of rough weather, and, we supposed, had suffered much\r\nin the gale which had proved so disastrous to ourselves; for her\r\nforetopmast was gone, and some of her starboard bulwarks. When we first\r\nsaw her, she was, as I have already said, about two miles off and to\r\nwindward, bearing down upon us. The breeze was very gentle, and what\r\nastonished us chiefly was, that she had no other sails set than her\r\nforesail and mainsail, with a flying jib--of course she came down but\r\nslowly, and our impatience amounted nearly to phrensy. The awkward\r\nmanner in which she steered, too, was remarked by all of us, even\r\nexcited as we were. She yawed about so considerably, that once or twice\r\nwe thought it impossible she could see us, or imagined that, having\r\nseen us, and discovered no person on board, she was about to tack and\r\nmake off in another direction. Upon each of these occasions we screamed\r\nand shouted at the top of our voices, when the stranger would appear to\r\nchange for a moment her intention, and again hold on towards us--this\r\nsingular conduct being repeated two or three times, so that at last we\r\ncould think of no other manner of accounting for it than by supposing\r\nthe helmsman to be in liquor.\r\n\r\nNo person was seen upon her decks until she arrived within about a\r\nquarter of a mile of us. We then saw three seamen, whom by their dress\r\nwe took to be Hollanders. Two of these were lying on some old sails\r\nnear the forecastle, and the third, who appeared to be looking at us\r\nwith great curiosity, was leaning over the starboard bow near the\r\nbowsprit. This last was a stout and tall man, with a very dark skin. He\r\nseemed by his manner to be encouraging us to have patience, nodding to\r\nus in a cheerful although rather odd way, and smiling constantly so as\r\nto display a set of the most brilliantly white teeth. As his vessel\r\ndrew nearer, we saw a red flannel cap which he had on fall from his\r\nhead into the water; but of this he took little or no notice,\r\ncontinuing his odd smiles and gesticulations. I relate these things and\r\ncircumstances minutely, and I relate them, it must be understood,\r\nprecisely as they _appeared_ to us.\r\n\r\nThe brig came on slowly, and now more steadily than before, and--I\r\ncannot speak calmly of this event--our hearts leaped up wildly within\r\nus, and we poured out our whole souls in shouts and thanksgiving to God\r\nfor the complete, unexpected, and glorious deliverance that was so\r\npalpably at hand. Of a sudden, and all at once, there came wafted over\r\nthe ocean from the strange vessel (which was now close upon us) a\r\nsmell, a stench, such as the whole world has no name for--no conception\r\nof--hellish--utterly suffocating--insufferable, inconceivable. I gasped\r\nfor breath, and, turning to my companions, perceived that they were\r\npaler than marble. But we had now no time left for question or\r\nsurmise--the brig was within fifty feet of us, and it seemed to be her\r\nintention to run under our counter, that we might board her without her\r\nputting out a boat. We rushed aft, when, suddenly, a wide yaw threw her\r\noff full five or six points from the course she had been running, and,\r\nas she passed under our stern at the distance of about twenty feet, we\r\nhad a full view of her decks. Shall I ever forget the triple horror of\r\nthat spectacle? Twenty-five or thirty human bodies, among whom were\r\nseveral females, lay scattered about between the counter and the\r\ngalley, in the last and most loathsome state of putrefaction! We\r\nplainly saw that not a soul lived in that fated vessel! Yet we could\r\nnot help shouting to the dead for help! Yes, long and loudly did we\r\nbeg, in the agony of the moment, that those silent and disgusting\r\nimages would stay for us, would not abandon us to become like them,\r\nwould receive us among their goodly company! We were raving with horror\r\nand despair--thoroughly mad through the anguish of our grievous\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nAs our first loud yell of terror broke forth, it was replied to by\r\nsomething, from near the bowsprit of the stranger, so closely\r\nresembling the scream of a human voice that the nicest ear might have\r\nbeen startled and deceived. At this instant another sudden yaw brought\r\nthe region of the forecastle for a moment into view, and we beheld at\r\nonce the origin of the sound. We saw the tall stout figure still\r\nleaning on the bulwark, and still nodding his head to and fro, but his\r\nface was now turned from us so that we could not behold it. His arms\r\nwere extended over the rail, and the palms of his hands fell outward.\r\nHis knees were lodged upon a stout rope, tightly stretched, and\r\nreaching from the heel of the bowsprit to a cathead. On his back, from\r\nwhich a portion of the shirt had been torn, leaving it bare, there sat\r\na huge seagull, busily gorging itself with the horrible flesh, its bill\r\nand talons deep buried, and its white plumage spattered all over with\r\nblood. As the brig moved further round so as to bring us close in view,\r\nthe bird, with much apparent difficulty, drew out its crimsoned head,\r\nand, after eying us for a moment as if stupified, arose lazily from the\r\nbody upon which it had been feasting, and, flying directly above our\r\ndeck, hovered there a while with a portion of clotted and liver-like\r\nsubstance in its beak. The horrid morsel dropped at length with a\r\nsullen splash immediately at the feet of Parker. May God forgive me,\r\nbut now, for the first time, there flashed through my mind a thought, a\r\nthought which I will not mention, and I felt myself making a step\r\ntowards the ensanguined spot. I looked upward, and the eyes of Augustus\r\nmet my own with a degree of intense and eager meaning which immediately\r\nbrought me to my senses. I sprang forward quickly, and, with a deep\r\nshudder, threw the frightful thing into the sea.\r\n\r\nThe body from which it had been taken, resting as it did upon the rope,\r\nhad been easily swayed to and fro by the exertions of the carnivorous\r\nbird, and it was this motion which had at first impressed us with the\r\nbelief of its being alive. As the gull relieved it of its weight, it\r\nswung round and fell partially over, so that the face was fully\r\ndiscovered. Never, surely, was any object so terribly full of awe! The\r\neyes were gone, and the whole flesh around the mouth, leaving the teeth\r\nutterly naked. This, then, was the smile which had cheered us on to\r\nhope! this the--but I forbear. The brig, as I have already told, passed\r\nunder our stern, and made its way slowly but steadily to leeward. With\r\nher and with her terrible crew went all our gay visions of deliverance\r\nand joy. Deliberately as she went by, we might possibly have found\r\nmeans of boarding her, had not our sudden disappointment, and the\r\nappalling nature of the discovery which accompanied it, laid entirely\r\nprostrate every active faculty of mind and body. We had seen and felt,\r\nbut we could neither think nor act, until, alas, too late. How much our\r\nintellects had been weakened by this incident may be estimated by the\r\nfact, that, when the vessel had proceeded so far that we could perceive\r\nno more than the half of her hull, the proposition was seriously\r\nentertained of attempting to overtake her by swimming!\r\n\r\nI have, since this period, vainly endeavoured to obtain some clew to\r\nthe hideous uncertainty which enveloped the fate of the stranger. Her\r\nbuild and general appearance, as I have before stated, led us to the\r\nbelief that she was a Dutch trader, and the dresses of the crew also\r\nsustained this opinion. We might have easily seen the name upon her\r\nstern, and, indeed, taken other observations which would have guided us\r\nin making out her character; but the intense excitement of the moment\r\nblinded us to everything of that nature. From the saffron-like hue of\r\nsuch of the corpses as were not entirely decayed, we concluded that the\r\nwhole of her company had perished by the yellow fever, or some other\r\nvirulent disease of the same fearful kind. If such were the case (and I\r\nknow not what else to imagine), death, to judge from the positions of\r\nthe bodies, must have come upon them in a manner awfully sudden and\r\noverwhelming, in a way totally distinct from that which generally\r\ncharacterizes even the most deadly pestilences with which mankind are\r\nacquainted. It is possible, indeed, that poison, accidentally\r\nintroduced into some of their sea-stores, may have brought about the\r\ndisaster; or that the eating some unknown venomous species of fish, or\r\nother marine animal, or oceanic bird, might have induced it--but it is\r\nutterly useless to form conjectures where all is involved, and will, no\r\ndoubt, remain for ever involved, in the most appalling and unfathomable\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe spent the remainder of the day in a condition of stupid lethargy,\r\ngazing after the retreating vessel until the darkness, hiding her from\r\nour sight, recalled us in some measure to our senses. The pangs of\r\nhunger and thirst then returned, absorbing all other cares and\r\nconsiderations. Nothing, however, could be done until the morning, and,\r\nsecuring ourselves as well as possible, we endeavoured to snatch a\r\nlittle repose. In this I succeeded beyond my expectation, sleeping\r\nuntil my companions, who had not been so fortunate, aroused me at\r\ndaybreak to renew our attempts at getting up provision from the hull.\r\n\r\nIt was now a dead calm, with the sea as smooth as I have ever known\r\nit--the weather warm and pleasant. The brig was out of sight. We\r\ncommenced our operations by wrenching off, with some trouble, another\r\nof the forechains; and having fastened both to Peters\'s feet, he again\r\nmade an endeavour to reach the door of the storeroom, thinking it\r\npossible that he might be able to force it open, provided he could get\r\nat it in sufficient time; and this he hoped to do, as the hulk lay much\r\nmore steadily than before.\r\n\r\nHe succeeded very quickly in reaching the door, when, loosening one of\r\nthe chains from his ankle, he made every exertion to force a passage\r\nwith it, but in vain, the framework of the room being far stronger than\r\nwas anticipated. He was quite exhausted with his long stay under water,\r\nand it became absolutely necessary that some other one of us should\r\ntake his place. For this service Parker immediately volunteered; but,\r\nafter making three ineffectual efforts, found that he could never even\r\nsucceed in getting near the door. The condition of Augustus\'s wounded\r\narm rendered it useless for him to attempt going down, as he would be\r\nunable to force the room open should he reach it, and it accordingly\r\nnow devolved upon me to exert myself for our common deliverance.\r\n\r\nPeters had left one of the chains in the passage, and I found, upon\r\nplunging in, that I had not sufficient ballast to keep me firmly down.\r\nI determined, therefore, to attempt no more, in my first effort, than\r\nmerely to recover the other chain. In groping along the floor of the\r\npassage for this I felt a hard substance, which I immediately grasped,\r\nnot having time to ascertain what it was, but returning and ascending\r\ninstantly to the surface. The prize proved to be a bottle, and our joy\r\nmay be conceived when I say that it was found to be full of Port wine.\r\nGiving thanks to God for this timely and cheering assistance, we\r\nimmediately drew the cork with my penknife, and, each taking a moderate\r\nsup, felt the most indescribable comfort from the warmth, strength, and\r\nspirits with which it inspired us. We then carefully recorked the\r\nbottle, and, by means of a handkerchief, swung it in such a manner that\r\nthere was no possibility of its getting broken.\r\n\r\nHaving rested a while after this fortunate discovery, I again\r\ndescended, and now recovered the chain, with which I instantly came up.\r\nI then fastened it on and went down for the third time, when I became\r\nfully satisfied that no exertions whatever, in that situation, would\r\nenable me to force open the door of the storeroom. I therefore returned\r\nin despair.\r\n\r\nThere seemed now to be no longer any room for hope, and I could\r\nperceive in the countenances of my companions that they had made up\r\ntheir minds to perish. The wine had evidently produced in them a\r\nspecies of delirium, which, perhaps, I had been prevented from feeling\r\nby the immersion I had undergone since drinking it. They talked\r\nincoherently, and about matters unconnected with our condition, Peters\r\nrepeatedly asking me questions about Nantucket. Augustus, too, I\r\nremember, approached me with a serious air, and requested me to lend\r\nhim a pocket-comb, as his hair was full of fish scales, and he wished\r\nto get them out before going on shore. Parker appeared somewhat less\r\naffected, and urged me to dive at random into the cabin, and bring up\r\nany article which might come to hand. To this I consented, and, in the\r\nfirst attempt, after staying under a full minute, brought up a small\r\nleather trunk belonging to Captain Barnard. This was immediately opened\r\nin the faint hope that it might contain something to eat or drink. We\r\nfound nothing, however, except a box of razors and two linen shirts. I\r\nnow went down again, and returned without any success. As my head came\r\nabove water I heard a crash on deck, and, upon getting up, saw that my\r\ncompanions had ungratefully taken advantage of my absence to drink the\r\nremainder of the wine, having let the bottle fall in the endeavour to\r\nreplace it before I saw them. I remonstrated with them on the\r\nheartlessness of their conduct, when Augustus burst into tears. The\r\nother two endeavoured to laugh the matter off as a joke, but I hope\r\nnever again to behold laughter of such a species: the distortion of\r\ncountenance was absolutely frightful. Indeed, it was apparent that the\r\nstimulus, in the empty state of their stomachs, had taken instant and\r\nviolent effect, and that they were all exceedingly intoxicated. With\r\ngreat difficulty I prevailed upon them to lie down, when they fell very\r\nsoon into a heavy slumber, accompanied with loud stertorous breathing.\r\n\r\nI now found myself, as it were, alone in the brig, and my reflections,\r\nto be sure, were of the most fearful and gloomy nature. No prospect\r\noffered itself to my view but a lingering death by famine, or, at the\r\nbest, by being overwhelmed in the first gale which should spring up,\r\nfor in our present exhausted condition we could have no hope of living\r\nthrough another.\r\n\r\nThe gnawing hunger which I now experienced was nearly insupportable,\r\nand I felt myself capable of going to any lengths in order to appease\r\nit. With my knife I cut off a small portion of the leather trunk, and\r\nendeavoured to eat it, but found it utterly impossible to swallow a\r\nsingle morsel, although I fancied that some little alleviation of my\r\nsuffering was obtained by chewing small pieces of it and spitting them\r\nout. Towards night my companions awoke, one by one, each in an\r\nindescribable state of weakness and horror, brought on by the wine,\r\nwhose fumes had now evaporated. They shook as if with a violent ague,\r\nand uttered the most lamentable cries for water. Their condition\r\naffected me in the most lively degree, at the same time causing me to\r\nrejoice in the fortunate train of circumstances which had prevented me\r\nfrom indulging in the wine, and consequently from sharing their\r\nmelancholy and most distressing sensations. Their conduct, however,\r\ngave me great uneasiness and alarm; for it was evident that, unless\r\nsome favourable change took place, they could afford me no assistance\r\nin providing for our common safety. I had not yet abandoned all idea of\r\nbeing able to get up something from below; but the attempt could not\r\npossibly be resumed until some one of them was sufficiently master of\r\nhimself to aid me by holding the end of the rope while I went down.\r\nParker appeared to be somewhat more in possession of his senses than\r\nthe others, and I endeavoured, by every means in my power, to arouse\r\nhim. Thinking that a plunge in the seawater might have a beneficial\r\neffect, I contrived to fasten the end of a rope around his body, and\r\nthen, leading him to the companion-way (he remaining quite passive all\r\nthe while), pushed him in, and immediately drew him out. I had good\r\nreason to congratulate myself upon having made this experiment; for he\r\nappeared much revived and invigorated, and, upon getting out, asked me,\r\nin a rational manner, why I had so served him. Having explained my\r\nobject, he expressed himself indebted to me, and said that he felt\r\ngreatly better from the immersion, afterward conversing sensibly upon\r\nour situation. We then resolved to treat Augustus and Peters in the\r\nsame way, which we immediately did, when they both experienced much\r\nbenefit from the shock. This idea of sudden immersion had been\r\nsuggested to me by reading in some medical work the good effect of the\r\nshower-bath in a case where the patient was suffering from _mania \xe0\r\npotu_.\r\n\r\nFinding that I could now trust my companions to hold the end of the\r\nrope, I again made three or four plunges into the cabin, although it\r\nwas now quite dark, and a gentle but long swell from the northward\r\nrendered the hulk somewhat unsteady. In the course of these attempts I\r\nsucceeded in bringing up two case-knives, a three-gallon jug, empty,\r\nand a blanket, but nothing which could serve us for food. I continued\r\nmy efforts, after getting these articles, until I was completely\r\nexhausted, but brought up nothing else. During the night Parker and\r\nPeters occupied themselves by turns in the same manner; but nothing\r\ncoming to hand, we now gave up this attempt in despair, concluding that\r\nwe were exhausting ourselves in vain.\r\n\r\nWe passed the remainder of this night in a state of the most intense\r\nmental and bodily anguish that can possibly be imagined. The morning of\r\nthe sixteenth at length dawned, and we looked eagerly around the\r\nhorizon for relief, but to no purpose. The sea was still smooth, with\r\nonly a long swell from the northward, as on yesterday. This was the\r\nsixth day since we had tasted either food or drink, with the exception\r\nof the bottle of Port wine, and it was clear that we could hold out but\r\na very little while longer unless something could be obtained. I never\r\nsaw before, nor wish to see again, human beings so utterly emaciated as\r\nPeters and Augustus. Had I met them on shore in their present condition\r\nI should not have had the slightest suspicion that I had ever beheld\r\nthem. Their countenances were totally changed in character, so that I\r\ncould not bring myself to believe them really the same individuals with\r\nwhom I had been in company but a few days before. Parker, although\r\nsadly reduced, and so feeble that he could not raise his head from his\r\nbosom, was not so far gone as the other two. He suffered with great\r\npatience, making no complaint, and endeavouring to inspire us with hope\r\nin every manner he could devise. For myself, although at the\r\ncommencement of the voyage I had been in bad health, and was at all\r\ntimes of a delicate constitution, I suffered less than any of us, being\r\nmuch less reduced in frame, and retaining my powers of mind in a\r\nsurprising degree, while the rest were completely prostrated in\r\nintellect, and seemed to be brought to a species of second childhood,\r\ngenerally simpering in their expressions, with idiotic smiles, and\r\nuttering the most absurd platitudes. At intervals, however, they would\r\nappear to revive suddenly, as if inspired all at once with a\r\nconsciousness of their condition, when they would spring upon their\r\nfeet in a momentary flash of vigour, and speak, for a short period, of\r\ntheir prospects, in a manner altogether rational, although full of the\r\nmost intense despair. It is possible, however, that my companions may\r\nhave entertained the same opinion of their own condition as I did of\r\nmine, and that I may have unwittingly been guilty of the same\r\nextravagances and imbecilities as themselves--this is a matter which\r\ncannot be determined.\r\n\r\nAbout noon Parker declared that he saw land off the larboard quarter,\r\nand it was with the utmost difficulty I could restrain him from\r\nplunging into the sea with the view of swimming towards it. Peters and\r\nAugustus took little notice of what he said, being apparently wrapped\r\nup in moody contemplation. Upon looking in the direction pointed out I\r\ncould not perceive the faintest appearance of the shore--indeed, I was\r\ntoo well aware that we were far from any land to indulge in a hope of\r\nthat nature. It was a long time, nevertheless, before I could convince\r\nParker of his mistake. He then burst into a flood of tears, weeping\r\nlike a child, with loud cries and sobs, for two or three hours, when,\r\nbecoming exhausted, he fell asleep.\r\n\r\nPeters and Augustus now made several ineffectual efforts to swallow\r\nportions of the leather. I advised them to chew it and spit it out; but\r\nthey were too excessively debilitated to be able to follow my advice. I\r\ncontinued to chew pieces of it at intervals, and found some relief from\r\nso doing; my chief distress was for water, and I was only prevented\r\nfrom taking a draught from the sea by remembering the horrible\r\nconsequences which thus have resulted to others who were similarly\r\nsituated with ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe day wore on in this manner, when I suddenly discovered a sail to\r\nthe eastward, and on our larboard bow. She appeared to be a large ship,\r\nand was coming nearly athwart us, being probably twelve or fifteen\r\nmiles distant. None of my companions had as yet discovered her, and I\r\nforbore to tell them of her for the present, lest we might again be\r\ndisappointed of relief. At length, upon her getting nearer, I saw\r\ndistinctly that she was heading immediately for us, with her light\r\nsails filled. I could now contain myself no longer, and pointed her out\r\nto my fellow-sufferers. They immediately sprang to their feet, again\r\nindulging in the most extravagant demonstrations of joy, weeping,\r\nlaughing in an idiotic manner, jumping, stamping upon the deck, tearing\r\ntheir hair, and praying and cursing by turns. I was so affected by\r\ntheir conduct, as well as by what I now considered a sure prospect of\r\ndeliverance, that I could not refrain from joining in with their\r\nmadness, and gave way to the impulses of my gratitude and ecstasy by\r\nlying and rolling on the deck, clapping my hands, shouting, and other\r\nsimilar acts, until I was suddenly called to my recollection, and once\r\nmore to the extreme of human misery and despair, by perceiving the ship\r\nall at once with her stern fully presented towards us, and steering in\r\na direction nearly opposite to that in which I had at first perceived\r\nher.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before I could induce my poor companions to believe\r\nthat this sad reverse in our prospects had actually taken place. They\r\nreplied to all my assertions with a stare and a gesture implying that\r\nthey were not to be deceived by such misrepresentations. The conduct of\r\nAugustus most sensibly affected me. In spite of all I could say or do\r\nto the contrary, he persisted in saying that the ship was rapidly\r\nnearing us, and in making preparations to go on board of her. Some\r\nseaweed floating by the brig, he maintained that it was the ship\'s\r\nboat, and endeavoured to throw himself upon it, howling and shrieking\r\nin the most heartrending manner, when I forcibly restrained him from\r\nthus casting himself into the sea.\r\n\r\nHaving become in some degree pacified, we continued to watch the ship\r\nuntil we finally lost sight of her, the weather becoming hazy, with a\r\nlight breeze springing up. As soon as she was entirely gone, Parker\r\nturned suddenly towards me with an expression of countenance which made\r\nme shudder. There was about him an air of self-possession which I had\r\nnot noticed in him until now, and before he opened his lips my heart\r\ntold me what he would say. He proposed, in a few words, that one of us\r\nshould die to preserve the existence of the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had, for some time past, dwelt upon the prospect of our being reduced\r\nto this last horrible extremity, and had secretly made up my mind to\r\nsuffer death in any shape or under any circumstances rather than resort\r\nto such a course. Nor was this resolution in any degree weakened by the\r\npresent intensity of hunger under which I laboured. The proposition had\r\nnot been heard by either Peters or Augustus. I therefore took Parker\r\naside; and mentally praying to God for power to dissuade him from the\r\nhorrible purpose he entertained, I expostulated with him for a long\r\ntime and in the most supplicating manner, begging him in the name of\r\neverything which he held sacred, and urging him by every species of\r\nargument which the extremity of the case suggested, to abandon the\r\nidea, and not to mention it to either of the other two.\r\n\r\nHe heard all I said without attempting to controvert any of my\r\narguments, and I had begun to hope that he would be prevailed upon to\r\ndo as I desired. But when I had ceased speaking, he said that he knew\r\nvery well all I had said was true, and that to resort to such a course\r\nwas the most horrible alternative which could enter into the mind of\r\nman; but that he had now held out as long as human nature could be\r\nsustained; that it was unnecessary for all to perish, when, by the\r\ndeath of one, it was possible, and even probable, that the rest might\r\nbe finally preserved; adding that I might save myself the trouble of\r\ntrying to turn him from his purpose, his mind having been thoroughly\r\nmade up on the subject even before the appearance of the ship, and that\r\nonly her heaving in sight had prevented him from mentioning his\r\nintention at an earlier period.\r\n\r\nI now begged him, if he would not be prevailed upon to abandon his\r\ndesign, at least to defer it for another day, when some vessel might\r\ncome to our relief; again reiterating every argument I could devise,\r\nand which I thought likely to have influence with one of his rough\r\nnature. He said, in reply, that he had not spoken until the very last\r\npossible moment; that he could exist no longer without sustenance of\r\nsome kind; and that therefore in another day his suggestion would be\r\ntoo late, as regarded himself at least.\r\n\r\nFinding that he was not to be moved by anything I could say in a mild\r\ntone, I now assumed a different demeanour, and told him that he must be\r\naware I had suffered less than any of us from our calamities; that my\r\nhealth and strength, consequently, were at that moment far better than\r\nhis own, or than that either of Peters or Augustus; in short, that I\r\nwas in a condition to have my own way by force if I found it necessary;\r\nand that, if he attempted in any manner to acquaint the others with his\r\nbloody and cannibal designs, I would not hesitate to throw him into the\r\nsea. Upon this he immediately seized me by the throat, and drawing a\r\nknife, made several ineffectual efforts to stab me in the stomach; an\r\natrocity which his excessive debility alone prevented him from\r\naccomplishing. In the mean time, being roused to a high pitch of anger,\r\nI forced him to the vessel\'s side, with the full intention of throwing\r\nhim overboard. He was saved from this fate, however, by the\r\ninterference of Peters, who now approached and separated us, asking the\r\ncause of the disturbance. This Parker told before I could find means in\r\nany manner to prevent him.\r\n\r\nThe effect of his words was even more terrible than what I had\r\nanticipated. Both Augustus and Peters, who, it seems, had long secretly\r\nentertained the same fearful idea which Parker had been merely the\r\nfirst to broach, joined with him in his design, and insisted upon its\r\nbeing immediately carried into effect. I had calculated that one at\r\nleast of the two former would be found still possessed of sufficient\r\nstrength of mind to side with myself in resisting any attempt to\r\nexecute so dreadful a purpose; and, with the aid of either one of them,\r\nI had no fear of being able to prevent its accomplishment. Being\r\ndisappointed in this expectation, it became absolutely necessary that I\r\nshould attend to my own safety, as a further resistance on my part\r\nmight possibly be considered by men in their frightful condition a\r\nsufficient excuse for refusing me fair play in the tragedy that I knew\r\nwould speedily be enacted.\r\n\r\nI now told them I was willing to submit to the proposal, merely\r\nrequesting a delay of about one hour, in order that the fog which had\r\ngathered around us might have an opportunity of lifting, when it was\r\npossible that the ship we had seen might be again in sight. After great\r\ndifficulty I obtained from them a promise to wait thus long; and, as I\r\nhad anticipated (a breeze rapidly coming in), the fog lifted before the\r\nhour had expired, when, no vessel appearing in sight, we prepared to\r\ndraw lots.\r\n\r\nIt is with extreme reluctance that I dwell upon the appalling scene\r\nwhich ensued; a scene which, with its minutest details, no after events\r\nhave been able to efface in the slightest degree from my memory, and\r\nwhose stern recollection will imbitter every future moment of my\r\nexistence. Let me run over this portion of my narrative with as much\r\nhaste as the nature of the events to be spoken of will permit. The only\r\nmethod we could devise for the terrific lottery, in which we were to\r\ntake each a chance, was that of drawing straws. Small splinters of wood\r\nwere made to answer our purpose, and it was agreed that I should be the\r\nholder. I retired to one end of the hulk, while my poor companions\r\nsilently took up their station in the other with their backs turned\r\ntowards me. The bitterest anxiety which I endured at any period of this\r\nfearful drama was while I occupied myself in the arrangement of the\r\nlots. There are few conditions into which man can possibly fall where\r\nhe will not feel a deep interest in the preservation of his existence;\r\nan interest momentarily increasing with the frailness of the tenure by\r\nwhich that existence may be held. But now that the silent, definite,\r\nand stern nature of the business in which I was engaged (so different\r\nfrom the tumultuous dangers of the storm or the gradually approaching\r\nhorrors of famine) allowed me to reflect on the few chances I had of\r\nescaping the most appalling of deaths--a death for the most appalling\r\nof purposes--every particle of that energy which had so long buoyed me\r\nup departed like feathers before the wind, leaving me a helpless prey\r\nto the most abject and pitiable terror. I could not, at first, even\r\nsummon up sufficient strength to tear and fit together the small\r\nsplinters of wood, my fingers absolutely refusing their office, and my\r\nknees knocking violently against each other. My mind ran over rapidly a\r\nthousand absurd projects by which to avoid becoming a partner in the\r\nawful speculation. I thought of falling on my knees to my companions,\r\nand entreating them to let me escape this necessity; of suddenly\r\nrushing upon them, and, by putting one of them to death, of rendering\r\nthe decision by lot useless--in short, of everything but of going\r\nthrough with the matter I had in hand. At last, after wasting a long\r\ntime in this imbecile conduct, I was recalled to my senses by the voice\r\nof Parker, who urged me to relieve them at once from the terrible\r\nanxiety they were enduring. Even then I could not bring myself to\r\narrange the splinters upon the spot, but thought over every species of\r\nfinesse by which I could trick some one of my fellow-sufferers to draw\r\nthe short straw, as it had been agreed that whoever drew the shortest\r\nof four splinters from my hand was to die for the preservation of the\r\nrest. Before any one condemn me for this apparent heartlessness, let\r\nhim be placed in a situation precisely similar to my own.\r\n\r\nAt length delay was no longer possible, and, with a heart almost\r\nbursting from my bosom, I advanced to the region of the forecastle,\r\nwhere my companions were awaiting me. I held out my hand with the\r\nsplinters, and Peters immediately drew. He was free--_his_, at least,\r\nwas not the shortest; and there was now another chance against my\r\nescape. I summoned up all my strength, and passed the lots to Augustus.\r\nHe also drew immediately, and he also was free; and now, whether I\r\nshould live or die, the chances were no more than precisely even. At\r\nthis moment all the fierceness of the tiger possessed my bosom, and I\r\nfelt towards my poor fellow-creature, Parker, the most intense, the\r\nmost diabolical hatred. But the feeling did not last; and, at length,\r\nwith a convulsive shudder and closed eyes, I held out the two remaining\r\nsplinters towards him. It was full five minutes before he could summon\r\nresolution to draw, during which period of heartrending suspense I\r\nnever once opened my eyes. Presently one of the two lots was quickly\r\ndrawn from my hand. The decision was then over, yet I knew not whether\r\nit was for me or against me. No one spoke, and still I dared not\r\nsatisfy myself by looking at the splinter I held. Peters at length took\r\nme by the hand, and I forced myself to look up, when I immediately saw\r\nby the countenance of Parker that I was safe, and that he it was who\r\nhad been doomed to suffer. Gasping for breath, I fell senseless to the\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\nI recovered from my swoon in time to behold the consummation of the\r\ntragedy in the death of him who had been chiefly instrumental in\r\nbringing it about. He made no resistance whatever, and was stabbed in\r\nthe back by Peters, when he fell instantly dead. I must not dwell upon\r\nthe fearful repast which immediately ensued. Such things may be\r\nimagined, but words have no power to impress the mind with the\r\nexquisite horror of their reality. Let it suffice to say that, having\r\nin some measure appeased the raging thirst which consumed us by the\r\nblood of the victim, and having by common consent taken off the hands,\r\nfeet, and head, throwing them, together with the entrails, into the\r\nsea, we devoured the rest of the body, piecemeal, during the four ever\r\nmemorable days of the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, and\r\ntwentieth of the month.\r\n\r\nOn the nineteenth, there coming on a smart shower which lasted fifteen\r\nor twenty minutes, we contrived to catch some water by means of a sheet\r\nwhich had been fished up from the cabin by our drag just after the\r\ngale. The quantity we took in all did not amount to more than half a\r\ngallon; but even this scanty allowance supplied us with comparative\r\nstrength and hope.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-first we were again reduced to the last necessity. The\r\nweather still remained warm and pleasant, with occasional fogs and\r\nlight breezes, most usually from N. to W.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-second, as we were sitting close huddled together,\r\ngloomily revolving over our lamentable condition, there flashed through\r\nmy mind all at once an idea which inspired me with a bright gleam of\r\nhope. I remembered that, when the foremast had been cut away, Peters,\r\nbeing in the windward chains, passed one of the axes into my hand,\r\nrequesting me to put it, if possible, in a place of security, and that\r\na few minutes before the last heavy sea struck the brig and filled her\r\nI had taken this axe into the forecastle, and laid it in one of the\r\nlarboard berths. I now thought it possible that, by getting at this\r\naxe, we might cut through the deck over the storeroom, and thus readily\r\nsupply ourselves with provisions.\r\n\r\nWhen I communicated this project to my companions, they uttered a\r\nfeeble shout of joy, and we all proceeded forthwith to the forecastle.\r\nThe difficulty of descending here was greater than that of going down\r\nin the cabin, the opening being much smaller, for it will be remembered\r\nthat the whole framework about the cabin companion-hatch had been\r\ncarried away, whereas the forecastle-way, being a simple hatch of only\r\nabout three feet square, had remained uninjured. I did not hesitate,\r\nhowever, to attempt the descent; and, a rope being fastened round my\r\nbody as before, I plunged boldly in, feet foremost, made my way quickly\r\nto the berth, and, at the very first attempt, brought up the axe. It\r\nwas hailed with the most ecstatic joy and triumph, and the ease with\r\nwhich it had been obtained was regarded as an omen of our ultimate\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\nWe now commenced cutting at the deck with all the energy of rekindled\r\nhope, Peters and myself taking the axe by turns, Augustus\'s wounded arm\r\nnot permitting him to aid us in any degree. As we were still so feeble\r\nas to be scarcely able to stand unsupported, and could consequently\r\nwork but a minute or two without resting, it soon became evident that\r\nmany long hours would be requisite to accomplish our task--that is, to\r\ncut an opening sufficiently large to admit of a free access to the\r\nstoreroom. This consideration, however, did not discourage us; and,\r\nworking all night by the light of the moon, we succeeded in effecting\r\nour purpose by daybreak on the morning of the twenty-third.\r\n\r\nPeters now volunteered to go down; and, having made all arrangements as\r\nbefore, he descended, and soon returned, bringing up with him a small\r\njar, which, to our great joy, proved to be full of olives. Having\r\nshared these among us, and devoured them with the greatest avidity, we\r\nproceeded to let him down again. This time he succeeded beyond our\r\nutmost expectations, returning instantly with a large ham and a bottle\r\nof Madeira wine. Of the latter we each took a moderate sup, having\r\nlearned by experience the pernicious consequences of indulging too\r\nfreely. The ham, except about two pounds near the bone, was not in a\r\ncondition to be eaten, having been entirely spoiled by the salt water.\r\nThe sound part was divided among us. Peters and Augustus, not being\r\nable to restrain their appetite, swallowed theirs upon the instant; but\r\nI was more cautious, and ate but a small portion of mine, dreading the\r\nthirst which I knew would ensue. We now rested a while from our\r\nlabours, which had been intolerably severe.\r\n\r\nBy noon, feeling somewhat strengthened and refreshed, we again renewed\r\nour attempt at getting up provision, Peters and myself going down\r\nalternately, and always with more or less success, until sundown.\r\nDuring this interval we had the good fortune to bring up, altogether,\r\nfour more small jars of olives, another ham, a carboy containing nearly\r\nthree gallons of excellent Cape Madeira wine, and, what gave us still\r\nmore delight, a small tortoise of the Gallipago breed, several of which\r\nhad been taken on board by Captain Barnard, as the Grampus was leaving\r\nport, from the schooner Mary Pitts, just returned from a sealing voyage\r\nin the Pacific.\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent portion of this narrative I shall have frequent\r\noccasion to mention this species of tortoise. It is found principally,\r\nas most of my readers may know, in the group of islands called the\r\nGallipagos, which, indeed, derive their name from the animal--the\r\nSpanish word Gallipago meaning a fresh-water terapin. From the\r\npeculiarity of their shape and action they have been sometimes called\r\nthe elephant tortoise. They are frequently found of an enormous size. I\r\nhave myself seen several which would weigh from twelve to fifteen\r\nhundred pounds, although I do not remember that any navigator speaks of\r\nhaving seen them weighing more than eight hundred. Their appearance is\r\nsingular, and even disgusting. Their steps are very slow, measured, and\r\nheavy, their bodies being carried about a foot from the ground. Their\r\nneck is long, and exceedingly slender; from eighteen inches to two feet\r\nis a very common length, and I killed one, where the distance from the\r\nshoulder to the extremity of the head was no less than three feet ten\r\ninches. The head has a striking resemblance to that of a serpent. They\r\ncan exist without food for an almost incredible length of time,\r\ninstances having been known where they have been thrown into the hold\r\nof a vessel and lain two years without nourishment of any kind--being\r\nas fat, and, in every respect, in as good order at the expiration of\r\nthe time as when they were first put in. In one particular these\r\nextraordinary animals bear a resemblance to the dromedary, or camel of\r\nthe desert. In a bag at the root of the neck they carry with them a\r\nconstant supply of water. In some instances, upon killing them after a\r\nfull year\'s deprivation of all nourishment, as much as three gallons of\r\nperfectly sweet and fresh water have been found in their bags. Their\r\nfood is chiefly wild parsley and celery, with purslain, sea-kelp, and\r\nprickly pears, upon which latter vegetable they thrive wonderfully, a\r\ngreat quantity of it being usually found on the hillsides near the\r\nshore wherever the animal itself is discovered. They are excellent and\r\nhighly nutritious food, and have, no doubt, been the means of\r\npreserving the lives of thousands of seamen employed in the\r\nwhale-fishery and other pursuits in the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe one which we had the good fortune to bring up from the storeroom\r\nwas not of a large size, weighing probably sixty-five or seventy\r\npounds. It was a female, and in excellent condition, being exceedingly\r\nfat, and having more than a quart of limpid and sweet water in its bag.\r\nThis was indeed a treasure; and, falling on our knees with one accord,\r\nwe returned fervent thanks to God for so seasonable a relief.\r\n\r\nWe had great difficulty in getting the animal up through the opening,\r\nas its struggles were fierce and its strength prodigious. It was upon\r\nthe point of making its escape from Peters\'s grasp, and slipping back\r\ninto the water, when Augustus, throwing a rope with a slip-knot around\r\nits throat, held it up in this manner until I jumped into the hole by\r\nthe side of Peters, and assisted him in lifting it out.\r\n\r\nThe water we drew carefully from the bag into the jug, which, it will\r\nbe remembered, had been brought up before from the cabin. Having done\r\nthis, we broke off the neck of a bottle so as to form, with the cork, a\r\nkind of glass, holding not quite half a gill. We then each drank one of\r\nthese measures full, and resolved to limit ourselves to this quantity\r\nper day as long as it should hold out.\r\n\r\nDuring the last two or three days, the weather having been dry and\r\npleasant, the bedding we had obtained from the cabin, as well as our\r\nclothing, had become thoroughly dry, so that we passed this night (that\r\nof the twenty-third) in comparative comfort, enjoying a tranquil\r\nrepose, after having supped plentifully on olives and ham, with a small\r\nallowance of the wine. Being afraid of losing some of our stores\r\noverboard during the night, in the event of a breeze springing up, we\r\nsecured them as well as possible with cordage to the fragments of the\r\nwindlass. Our tortoise, which we were anxious to preserve alive as long\r\nas we could, we threw on his back, and otherwise carefully fastened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 24._ This morning saw us wonderfully recruited in spirits and\r\nstrength. Notwithstanding the perilous situation in which we were still\r\nplaced, ignorant of our position, although certainly at a great\r\ndistance from land, without more food than would last us for a\r\nfortnight even with great care, almost entirely without water, and\r\nfloating about at the mercy of every wind and wave, on the merest wreck\r\nin the world, still the infinitely more terrible distresses and dangers\r\nfrom which we had so lately and so providentially been delivered caused\r\nus to regard what we now endured as but little more than an ordinary\r\nevil--so strictly comparative is either good or ill.\r\n\r\nAt sunrise we were preparing to renew our attempts at getting up\r\nsomething from the storeroom, when, a smart shower coming on, with some\r\nlightning, we turned our attention to the catching of water by means of\r\nthe sheet we had used before for this purpose. We had no other means of\r\ncollecting the rain than by holding the sheet spread out with one of\r\nthe forechain-plates in the middle of it. The water, thus conducted to\r\nthe centre, was drained through into our jug. We had nearly filled it\r\nin this manner, when, a heavy squall coming on from the northward,\r\nobliged us to desist, as the hulk began once more to roll so violently\r\nthat we could no longer keep our feet. We now went forward, and,\r\nlashing ourselves securely to the remnant of the windlass as before,\r\nawaited the event with far more calmness than could have been\r\nanticipated, or would have been imagined possible under the\r\ncircumstances. At noon the wind had freshened into a two-reef breeze,\r\nand by night into a stiff gale, accompanied with a tremendously heavy\r\nswell. Experience having taught us, however, the best method of\r\narranging our lashings, we weathered this dreary night in tolerable\r\nsecurity, although thoroughly drenched at almost every instant by the\r\nsea, and in momentary dread of being washed off. Fortunately, the\r\nweather was so warm as to render the water rather grateful than\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\n_July 25._ This morning the gale had diminished to a mere ten-knot\r\nbreeze, and the sea had gone down with it so considerably that we were\r\nable to keep ourselves dry upon the deck. To our great grief, however,\r\nwe found that two jars of our olives, as well as the whole of our ham,\r\nhad been washed overboard, in spite of the careful manner in which they\r\nhad been fastened. We determined not to kill the tortoise as yet, and\r\ncontented ourselves for the present with a breakfast on a few of the\r\nolives, and a measure of water each, which latter we mixed, half and\r\nhalf, with wine, finding great relief and strength from the mixture,\r\nwithout the distressing intoxication which had ensued upon drinking the\r\nPort. The sea was still far too rough for the renewal of our efforts at\r\ngetting up provision from the storeroom. Several articles, of no\r\nimportance to us in our present situation, floated up through the\r\nopening during the day, and were immediately washed overboard. We also\r\nnow observed that the hulk lay more along than ever, so that we could\r\nnot stand an instant without lashing ourselves. On this account we\r\npassed a gloomy and uncomfortable day. At noon the sun appeared to be\r\nnearly vertical, and we had no doubt that we had been driven down by\r\nthe long succession of northward and northwesterly winds into the near\r\nvicinity of the equator. Towards evening saw several sharks, and were\r\nsomewhat alarmed by the audacious manner in which an enormously large\r\none approached us. At one time, a lurch throwing the deck very far\r\nbeneath the water, the monster actually swam in upon us, floundering\r\nfor some moments just over the companion-hatch, and striking Peters\r\nviolently with his tail. A heavy sea at length hurled him overboard,\r\nmuch to our relief. In moderate weather we might have easily captured\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n_July 26._ This morning, the wind having greatly abated, and the sea\r\nnot being very rough, we determined to renew our exertions in the\r\nstoreroom. After a great deal of hard labour during the whole day, we\r\nfound that nothing further was to be expected from this quarter, the\r\npartitions of the room having been stove during the night, and its\r\ncontents swept into the hold. This discovery, as may be supposed,\r\nfilled us with despair.\r\n\r\n_July 27._ The sea nearly smooth, with a light wind, and still from the\r\nnorthward and westward. The sun coming out hotly in the afternoon, we\r\noccupied ourselves in drying our clothes. Found great relief from\r\nthirst, and much comfort otherwise, by bathing in the sea; in this,\r\nhowever, we were forced to use great caution, being afraid of sharks,\r\nseveral of which were seen swimming around the brig during the day.\r\n\r\n_July 28._ Good weather still. The brig now began to lie along so\r\nalarmingly that we feared she would eventually roll bottom up. Prepared\r\nourselves as well as we could for this emergency, lashing our tortoise,\r\nwater-jug, and two remaining jars of olives as far as possible over to\r\nthe windward, placing them outside the hull, below the main-chains. The\r\nsea very smooth all day, with little or no wind.\r\n\r\n_July 29._ A continuance of the same weather. Augustus\'s wounded arm\r\nbegan to evince symptoms of mortification. He complained of drowsiness\r\nand excessive thirst, but no acute pain. Nothing could be done for his\r\nrelief beyond rubbing his wounds with a little of the vinegar from the\r\nolives, and from this no benefit seemed to be experienced. We did\r\neverything in our power for his comfort, and trebled his allowance of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_July 30._ An excessively hot day, with no wind. An enormous shark kept\r\nclose by the hulk during the whole of the forenoon. We made several\r\nunsuccessful attempts to capture him by means of a noose. Augustus much\r\nworse, and evidently sinking as much from want of proper nourishment as\r\nfrom the effect of his wounds. He constantly prayed to be released from\r\nhis sufferings, wishing for nothing but death. This evening we ate the\r\nlast of our olives, and found the water in our jug so putrid that we\r\ncould not swallow it at all without the addition of wine. Determined to\r\nkill our tortoise in the morning.\r\n\r\n_July 31._ After a night of excessive anxiety and fatigue, owing to the\r\nposition of the hulk, we set about killing and cutting up our tortoise.\r\nHe proved to be much smaller than we had supposed, although in good\r\ncondition--the whole meat about him not amounting to more than ten\r\npounds. With a view of preserving a portion of this as long as\r\npossible, we cut it into fine pieces, and filled with them our three\r\nremaining olive-jars and the wine-bottle (all of which had been kept),\r\npouring in afterward the vinegar from the olives. In this manner we put\r\naway about three pounds of the tortoise, intending not to touch it\r\nuntil we had consumed the rest. We concluded to restrict ourselves to\r\nabout four ounces of the meat per day; the whole would thus last us\r\nthirteen days. A brisk shower, with severe thunder and lightning, came\r\non about dusk, but lasted so short a time that we only succeeded in\r\ncatching about half a pint of water. The whole of this, by common\r\nconsent, was given to Augustus, who now appeared to be in the last\r\nextremity. He drank the water from the sheet as we caught it (we\r\nholding it above him as he lay so as to let it run into his mouth), for\r\nwe had now nothing left capable of holding water, unless we had chosen\r\nto empty out our wine from the carboy, or the stale water from the jug.\r\nEither of these expedients would have been resorted to had the shower\r\nlasted.\r\n\r\nThe sufferer seemed to derive but little benefit from the draught. His\r\narm was completely black from the wrist to the shoulder, and his feet\r\nwere like ice. We expected every moment to see him breathe his last. He\r\nwas frightfully emaciated; so much so that, although he weighed a\r\nhundred and twenty-seven pounds upon his leaving Nantucket, he now did\r\nnot weigh more than _forty or fifty at the farthest_. His eyes were\r\nsunk far in his head, being scarcely perceptible, and the skin of his\r\ncheeks hung so loosely as to prevent his masticating any food, or even\r\nswallowing any liquid, without great difficulty.\r\n\r\n_August 1._ A continuance of the same calm weather, with an\r\noppressively hot sun. Suffered exceedingly from thirst, the water in\r\nthe jug being absolutely putrid and swarming with vermin. We contrived,\r\nnevertheless, to swallow a portion of it by mixing it with wine--our\r\nthirst, however, was but little abated. We found more relief by bathing\r\nin the sea, but could not avail ourselves of this expedient except at\r\nlong intervals, on account of the continual presence of sharks. We now\r\nsaw clearly that Augustus could not be saved; that he was evidently\r\ndying. We could do nothing to relieve his sufferings, which appeared to\r\nbe great. About twelve o\'clock he expired in strong convulsions, and\r\nwithout having spoken for several hours. His death filled us with the\r\nmost gloomy forebodings, and had so great an effect upon our spirits\r\nthat we sat motionless by the corpse during the whole day, and never\r\naddressed each other except in a whisper. It was not until some time\r\nafter dark that we took courage to get up and throw the body overboard.\r\nIt was then loathsome beyond expression, and so far decayed that, as\r\nPeters attempted to lift it, an entire leg came off in his grasp. As\r\nthe mass of putrefaction slipped over the vessel\'s side into the water,\r\nthe glare of phosphoric light with which it was surrounded plainly\r\ndiscovered to us seven or eight large sharks, the clashing of whose\r\nhorrible teeth, as their prey was torn to pieces among them, might have\r\nbeen heard at the distance of a mile. We shrunk within ourselves in the\r\nextremity of horror at the sound.\r\n\r\n_August 2._ The same fearfully calm and hot weather. The dawn found us\r\nin a state of pitiable dejection as well as bodily exhaustion. The\r\nwater in the jug was now absolutely useless, being a thick gelatinous\r\nmass; nothing but frightful-looking worms mingled with slime. We threw\r\nit out, and washed the jug well in the sea, afterward pouring a little\r\nvinegar in it from our bottles of pickled tortoise. Our thirst could\r\nnow scarcely be endured, and we tried in vain to relieve it by wine,\r\nwhich seemed only to add fuel to the flame, and excited us to a high\r\ndegree of intoxication. We afterward endeavoured to relieve our\r\nsufferings by mixing the wine with seawater; but this instantly brought\r\nabout the most violent retchings, so that we never again attempted it.\r\nDuring the whole day we anxiously sought an opportunity of bathing, but\r\nto no purpose; for the hulk was now entirely besieged on all sides with\r\nsharks--no doubt the identical monsters who had devoured our poor\r\ncompanion on the evening before, and who were in momentary expectation\r\nof another similar feast. This circumstance occasioned us the most\r\nbitter regret, and filled us with the most depressing and melancholy\r\nforebodings. We had experienced indescribable relief in bathing, and to\r\nhave this resource cut off in so frightful a manner was more than we\r\ncould bear. Nor, indeed, were we altogether free from the apprehension\r\nof immediate danger, for the least slip or false movement would have\r\nthrown us at once within reach of these voracious fish, who frequently\r\nthrust themselves directly upon us, swimming up to leeward. No shouts\r\nor exertions on our part seemed to alarm them. Even when one of the\r\nlargest was struck with an axe by Peters, and much wounded, he\r\npersisted in his attempts to push in where we were. A cloud came up at\r\ndusk, but, to our extreme anguish, passed over without discharging\r\nitself. It is quite impossible to conceive our sufferings from thirst\r\nat this period. We passed a sleepless night, both on this account and\r\nthrough dread of the sharks.\r\n\r\n_August 3._ No prospect of relief, and the brig lying still more and\r\nmore along, so that now we could not maintain a footing upon deck at\r\nall. Busied ourselves in securing our wine and tortoise-meat, so that\r\nwe might not lose them in the event of our rolling over. Got out two\r\nstout spikes from the forechains, and, by means of the axe, drove them\r\ninto the hull to windward within a couple of feet of the water; this\r\nnot being very far from the keel, as we were nearly upon our beam-ends.\r\nTo these spikes we now lashed our provisions, as being more secure than\r\ntheir former position beneath the chains. Suffered great agony from\r\nthirst during the whole day--no chance of bathing on account of the\r\nsharks, which never left us for a moment. Found it impossible to sleep.\r\n\r\n_August 4._ A little before daybreak we perceived that the hulk was\r\nheeling over, and aroused ourselves to prevent being thrown off by the\r\nmovement. At first the roll was slow and gradual, and we contrived to\r\nclamber over to windward very well, having taken the precaution to\r\nleave ropes hanging from the spikes we had driven in for the provision.\r\nBut we had not calculated sufficiently upon the acceleration of the\r\nimpetus; for presently the heel became too violent to allow of our\r\nkeeping pace with it; and, before either of us knew what was to happen,\r\nwe found ourselves hurled furiously into the sea, and struggling\r\nseveral fathoms beneath the surface, with the huge hull immediately\r\nabove us.\r\n\r\nIn going under the water I had been obliged to let go my hold upon the\r\nrope; and finding that I was completely beneath the vessel, and my\r\nstrength utterly exhausted, I scarcely made a struggle for life, and\r\nresigned myself, in a few seconds, to die. But here again I was\r\ndeceived, not having taken into consideration the natural rebound of\r\nthe hull to windward. The whirl of the water upward, which the vessel\r\noccasioned in rolling partially back, brought me to the surface still\r\nmore violently than I had been plunged beneath. Upon coming up, I found\r\nmyself about twenty yards from the hulk, as near as I could judge. She\r\nwas lying keel up, rocking furiously from side to side, and the sea in\r\nall directions around was much agitated, and full of strong whirlpools.\r\nI could see nothing of Peters. An oil-cask was floating within a few\r\nfeet of me, and various other articles from the brig were scattered\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nMy principal terror was now on account of the sharks, which I knew to\r\nbe in my vicinity. In order to deter these, if possible, from\r\napproaching me, I splashed the water vigorously with both hands and\r\nfeet as I swam towards the hulk, creating a body of foam. I have no\r\ndoubt that to this expedient, simple as it was, I was indebted for my\r\npreservation; for the sea all around the brig, just before her rolling\r\nover, was so crowded with these monsters, that I must have been, and\r\nreally was, in actual contact with some of them during my progress. By\r\ngreat good fortune, however, I reached the side of the vessel in\r\nsafety, although so utterly weakened by the violent exertion I had used\r\nthat I should never have been able to get upon it but for the timely\r\nassistance of Peters, who now, to my great joy, made his appearance\r\n(having scrambled up to the keel from the opposite side of the hull),\r\nand threw me the end of a rope--one of those which had been attached to\r\nthe spikes.\r\n\r\nHaving barely escaped this danger, our attention was now directed to\r\nthe dreadful imminency of another; that of absolute starvation. Our\r\nwhole stock of provision had been swept overboard in spite of all our\r\ncare in securing it; and seeing no longer the remotest possibility of\r\nobtaining more, we gave way both of us to despair, weeping aloud like\r\nchildren, and neither of us attempting to offer consolation to the\r\nother. Such weakness can scarcely be conceived, and to those who have\r\nnever been similarly situated will, no doubt, appear unnatural; but it\r\nmust be remembered that our intellects were so entirely disordered by\r\nthe long course of privation and terror to which we had been subjected,\r\nthat we could not justly be considered, at that period, in the light of\r\nrational beings. In subsequent perils, nearly as great, if not greater,\r\nI bore up with fortitude against all the evils of my situation, and\r\nPeters, it will be seen, evinced a stoical philosophy nearly as\r\nincredible as his present childlike supineness and imbecility--the\r\nmental condition made the difference.\r\n\r\nThe overturning of the brig, even with the consequent loss of the wine\r\nand turtle, would not, in fact, have rendered our situation more\r\ndeplorable than before, except for the disappearance of the bedclothes\r\nby which we had been hitherto enabled to catch rainwater, and of the\r\njug in which we had kept it when caught; for we found the whole bottom,\r\nfrom within two or three feet of the bends as far as the keel, together\r\nwith the keel itself, _thickly covered with large barnacles, which\r\nproved to be excellent and highly nutritious food_. Thus, in two\r\nimportant respects, the accident we had so greatly dreaded proved a\r\nbenefit rather than an injury; it had opened to us a supply of\r\nprovisions, which we could not have exhausted, using it moderately, in\r\na month; and it had greatly contributed to our comfort as regards\r\nposition, we being much more at our ease, and in infinitely less\r\ndanger, than before.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty, however, of now obtaining water blinded us to all the\r\nbenefits of the change in our condition. That we might be ready to\r\navail ourselves, as far as possible, of any shower which might fall, we\r\ntook off our shirts, to make use of them as we had of the sheets--not\r\nhoping, of course, to get more in this way, even under the most\r\nfavourable circumstances, than half a gill at a time. No signs of a\r\ncloud appeared during the day, and the agonies of our thirst were\r\nnearly intolerable. At night Peters obtained about an hour\'s disturbed\r\nsleep, but my intense sufferings would not permit me to close my eyes\r\nfor a single moment.\r\n\r\n_August 5._ To-day, a gentle breeze springing up carried us through a\r\nvast quantity of seaweed, among which we were so fortunate as to find\r\neleven small crabs, which afforded us several delicious meals. Their\r\nshells being quite soft, we ate them entire, and found that they\r\nirritated our thirst far less than the barnacles. Seeing no trace of\r\nsharks among the seaweed, we also ventured to bathe, and remained in\r\nthe water for four or five hours, during which we experienced a very\r\nsensible diminution of our thirst. Were greatly refreshed, and spent\r\nthe night somewhat more comfortably than before, both of us snatching a\r\nlittle sleep.\r\n\r\n_August 6._ This day we were blessed by a brisk and continual rain,\r\nlasting from about noon until after dark. Bitterly did we now regret\r\nthe loss of our jug and carboy; for, in spite of the little means we\r\nhad of catching the water, we might have filled one, if not both of\r\nthem. As it was, we contrived to satisfy the cravings of thirst by\r\nsuffering the shirts to become saturated, and then wringing them so as\r\nto let the grateful fluid trickle into our mouths. In this occupation\r\nwe passed the entire day.\r\n\r\n_August 7._ Just at daybreak we both at the same instant descried a\r\nsail to the eastward, and _evidently coming towards us!_ We hailed the\r\nglorious sight with a long, although feeble shout of rapture; and began\r\ninstantly to make every signal in our power, by flaring the shirts in\r\nthe air, leaping as high as our weak condition would permit, and even\r\nby hallooing with all the strength of our lungs, although the vessel\r\ncould not have been less than fifteen miles distant. However, she still\r\ncontinued to near our hulk, and we felt that, if she but held her\r\npresent course, she must eventually come so close as to perceive us. In\r\nabout an hour after we first discovered her we could clearly see the\r\npeople on her decks. She was a long, low, and rakish-looking topsail\r\nschooner, with a black ball in her foretopsail, and had, apparently, a\r\nfull crew. We now became alarmed, for we could hardly imagine it\r\npossible that she did not observe us, and were apprehensive that she\r\nmeant to leave us to perish as we were--an act of fiendish barbarity,\r\nwhich, however incredible it may appear, has been repeatedly\r\nperpetrated at sea, under circumstances very nearly similar, and by\r\nbeings who were regarded as belonging to the human species.[2] In this\r\ninstance, however, by the mercy of God, we were destined to be most\r\nhappily deceived; for presently we were aware of a sudden commotion on\r\nthe deck of the stranger, who immediately afterward run up a British\r\nflag, and, hauling her wind, bore up directly upon us. In half an hour\r\nmore we found ourselves in her cabin. She proved to be the Jane Guy, of\r\nLiverpool, Captain Guy, bound on a sealing and trading voyage to the\r\nSouth Seas and Pacific.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The case of the brig Polly, of Boston, is one so much in\r\npoint, and her fate, in many respects, so remarkably similar to our\r\nown, that I cannot forbear alluding to it here. This vessel, of one\r\nhundred and thirty tons burden, sailed from Boston, with a cargo of\r\nlumber and provisions, for Santa Croix, on the twelfth of December,\r\n1811, under the command of Captain Casneau. There were eight souls on\r\nboard besides the captain--the mate, four seamen, and the cook,\r\ntogether with a Mr. Hunt, and a negro girl belonging to him. On the\r\nfifteenth, having cleared the shoal of Georges, she sprung a leak in a\r\ngale of wind from the southeast, and was finally capsized; but, the\r\nmast going by the board, she afterward righted. They remained in this\r\nsituation, without fire, and with very little provision, for the period\r\nof _one hundred and ninety-one days_ (from December the fifteenth to\r\nJune the twentieth) when Captain Casneau and Samuel Badger, the only\r\nsurvivers, were taken off the wreck by the Fame, of Hull, Captain\r\nFeatherstone, bound home from Rio Janeiro. When picked up they were in\r\nlatitude _28 N., longitude 13 W., having drifted above two thousand\r\nmiles_. On the ninth of July the Fame fell in with the brig Dromeo,\r\nCaptain Perkins, who landed the two sufferers in Kennebeck. The\r\nnarrative from which we gather these details ends in the following\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n"It is natural to inquire how they could float such a vast distance,\r\nupon the most frequented part of the Atlantic, and not be discovered\r\nall this time. _They were passed by more than a dozen sail, one of\r\nwhich came so nigh them that they could distinctly see the people on\r\ndeck and on the rigging looking at them; but, to the inexpressible\r\ndisappointment of the starving and freezing men, they stifled the\r\ndictates of compassion, hoisted sail, and cruelly abandoned them to\r\ntheir fate._"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Jane Guy was a fine-looking topsail schooner of a hundred and\r\neighty tons burden. She was unusually sharp in the bows, and on a wind,\r\nin moderate weather, the fastest sailer I have ever seen. Her\r\nqualities, however, as a rough sea-boat, were not so good, and her\r\ndraught of water was by far too great for the trade to which she was\r\ndestined. For this peculiar service a larger vessel, and one of a light\r\nproportionate draught, is desirable--say a vessel of from three to\r\nthree hundred and fifty tons. She should be barque-rigged, and in other\r\nrespects of a different construction from the usual South Sea ships. It\r\nis absolutely necessary that she should be well armed. She should have,\r\nsay ten or twelve twelve pound carronades, and two or three long\r\ntwelves, with brass blunderbusses, and water-tight arm-chests for each\r\ntop. Her anchors and cables should be of far greater strength than is\r\nrequired for any other species of trade, and, above all, her crew\r\nshould be numerous and efficient--not less, for such a vessel as I have\r\ndescribed, than fifty or sixty able-bodied men. The Jane Guy had a crew\r\nof thirty-five, all able seamen, besides the captain and mate, but she\r\nwas not altogether as well armed or otherwise equipped as a navigator\r\nacquainted with the difficulties and dangers of the trade could have\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nCaptain Guy was a gentleman of great urbanity of manner, and of\r\nconsiderable experience in the southern traffic, to which he had\r\ndevoted a great portion of his life. He was deficient, however, in\r\nenergy, and, consequently, in that spirit of enterprise which is here\r\nso absolutely requisite. He was part owner of the vessel in which he\r\nsailed, and was invested with discretionary powers to cruise in the\r\nSouth Seas for any cargo which might come most readily to hand. He had\r\non board, as usual in such voyages, beads, looking-glasses,\r\ntinder-works, axes, hatchets, saws, adzes, planes, chisels, gouges,\r\ngimlets, files, spokeshaves, rasps, hammers, nails, knives, scissors,\r\nrazors, needles, thread, crockery-ware, calico, trinkets, and other\r\nsimilar articles.\r\n\r\nThe schooner sailed from Liverpool on the tenth of July, crossed the\r\nTropic of Cancer on the twenty-fifth, in longitude twenty degrees west,\r\nand reached Sal, one of the Cape Verd Islands, on the twenty-ninth,\r\nwhere she took in salt and other necessaries for the voyage. On the\r\nthird of August she left the Cape Verds and steered southwest,\r\nstretching over towards the coast of Brazil so as to cross the equator\r\nbetween the meridians of twenty-eight and thirty degrees west\r\nlongitude. This is the course usually taken by vessels bound from\r\nEurope to the Cape of Good Hope, or by that route to the East Indies.\r\nBy proceeding thus they avoid the calms and strong contrary currents\r\nwhich continually prevail on the coast of Guinea, while, in the end, it\r\nis found to be the shortest track, as westerly winds are never wanting\r\nafterward by which to reach the Cape. It was Captain Guy\'s intention to\r\nmake his first stoppage at Kerguelen\'s Land--I hardly know for what\r\nreason. On the day we were picked up the schooner was off Cape St.\r\nRoque, in longitude 31 W.; so that, when found, we had drifted\r\nprobably, from north to south, _not less than five-and-twenty degrees_.\r\n\r\nOn board the Jane Guy we were treated with all the kindness our\r\ndistressed situation demanded. In about a fortnight, during which time\r\nwe continued steering to the southeast, with gentle breezes and fine\r\nweather, both Peters and myself recovered entirely from the effects of\r\nour late privation and dreadful suffering, and we began to remember\r\nwhat had passed rather as a frightful dream from which we had been\r\nhappily awakened, than as events which had taken place in sober and\r\nnaked reality. I have since found that this species of partial oblivion\r\nis usually brought about by sudden transition, whether from joy to\r\nsorrow or from sorrow to joy--the degree of forgetfulness being\r\nproportioned to the degree of difference in the exchange. Thus, in my\r\nown case, I now feel it impossible to realize the full extent of the\r\nmisery which I endured during the days spent upon the hulk. The\r\nincidents are remembered, but not the feelings which the incidents\r\nelicited at the time of their occurrence. I only know that, when they\r\ndid occur, I _then_ thought human nature could sustain nothing more of\r\nagony.\r\n\r\nWe continued our voyage for some weeks without any incidents of greater\r\nmoment than the occasional meeting with whaling-ships, and more\r\nfrequently with the black or right whale, so called in\r\ncontradistinction to the spermaceti. These, however, were chiefly found\r\nsouth of the twenty-fifth parallel. On the sixteenth of September,\r\nbeing in the vicinity of the Cape of Good Hope, the schooner\r\nencountered her first gale of any violence since leaving Liverpool. In\r\nthis neighbourhood, but more frequently to the south and east of the\r\npromontory (we were to the westward), navigators have often to contend\r\nwith storms from the northward which rage with great fury. They always\r\nbring with them a heavy sea, and one of their most dangerous features\r\nis the instantaneous chopping round of the wind, an occurrence almost\r\ncertain to take place during the greatest force of the gale. A perfect\r\nhurricane will be blowing at one moment from the northward or\r\nnortheast, and in the next not a breath of wind will be felt in that\r\ndirection, while from the southwest it will come out all at once with a\r\nviolence almost inconceivable. A bright spot to the southward is the\r\nsure forerunner of the change, and vessels are thus enabled to take the\r\nproper precautions.\r\n\r\nIt was about six in the morning when the blow came on with a white\r\nsquall, and, as usual, from the northward. By eight it had increased\r\nvery much, and brought down upon us one of the most tremendous seas I\r\nhad then ever beheld. Everything had been made as snug as possible, but\r\nthe schooner laboured excessively, and gave evidence of her bad\r\nqualities as a seaboat, pitching her forecastle under at every plunge,\r\nand with the greatest difficulty struggling up from one wave before she\r\nwas buried in another. Just before sunset the bright spot for which we\r\nhad been on the lookout made its appearance in the southwest, and in an\r\nhour afterward we perceived the little headsail we carried flapping\r\nlistlessly against the mast. In two minutes more, in spite of every\r\npreparation, we were hurled on our beam-ends as if by magic, and a\r\nperfect wilderness of foam made a clear breach over us as we lay. The\r\nblow from the southwest, however, luckily proved to be nothing more\r\nthan a squall, and we had the good fortune to right the vessel without\r\nthe loss of a spar. A heavy cross sea gave us great trouble for a few\r\nhours after this, but towards morning we found ourselves in nearly as\r\ngood condition as before the gale. Captain Guy considered that he had\r\nmade an escape little less than miraculous.\r\n\r\nOn the thirteenth of October we came in sight of Prince Edward\'s\r\nIsland, in latitude 46\xb0 53\' S., longitude 37\xb0 46\' E. Two days afterward\r\nwe found ourselves near Possession Island, and presently passed the\r\nislands of Crozet, in latitude 42\xb0 59\' S., longitude 48\xb0 E. On the\r\neighteenth we made Kerguelen\'s or Desolation Island, in the Southern\r\nIndian Ocean, and came to anchor in Christmas Harbour, having four\r\nfathoms of water.\r\n\r\nThis island, or rather group of islands, bears southeast from the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, and is distant therefrom nearly eight hundred leagues. It\r\nwas first discovered in 1772, by the Baron de Kergulen, or Kerguelen, a\r\nFrenchman, who, thinking the land to form a portion of an extensive\r\nsouthern continent, carried home information to that effect, which\r\nproduced much excitement at the time. The government, taking the matter\r\nup, sent the baron back in the following year for the purpose of giving\r\nhis new discovery a critical examination, when the mistake was\r\ndiscovered. In 1777, Captain Cook fell in with the same group, and gave\r\nto the principal one the name of Desolation Island, a title which it\r\ncertainly well deserves. Upon approaching the land, however, the\r\nnavigator might be induced to suppose otherwise, as the sides of most\r\nof the hills, from September to March, are clothed with very brilliant\r\nverdure. This deceitful appearance is caused by a small plant\r\nresembling saxifrage, which is abundant, growing in large patches on a\r\nspecies of crumbling moss. Besides this plant there is scarcely a sign\r\nof vegetation on the island, if we except some coarse rank grass near\r\nthe harbour, some lichen, and a shrub which bears resemblance to a\r\ncabbage shooting into seed, and which has a bitter and acrid taste.\r\n\r\nThe face of the country is hilly, although none of the hills can be\r\ncalled lofty. Their tops are perpetually covered with snow. There are\r\nseveral harbours, of which Christmas Harbour is the most convenient. It\r\nis the first to be met with on the northeast side of the island after\r\npassing Cape Fran\xe7ois, which forms the northern shore, and, by its\r\npeculiar shape, serves to distinguish the harbour. Its projecting point\r\nterminates in a high rock, through which is a large hole, forming a\r\nnatural arch. The entrance is in latitude 48\xb0 40\' S., longitude 69\xb0 6\'\r\nE. Passing in here, good anchorage may be found under the shelter of\r\nseveral small islands, which form a sufficient protection from all\r\neasterly winds. Proceeding on eastwardly from this anchorage you come\r\nto Wasp Bay, at the head of the harbour. This is a small basin,\r\ncompletely landlocked, into which you can go with four fathoms, and\r\nfind anchorage in from ten to three, hard clay bottom. A ship might lie\r\nhere with her best bower ahead all the year round without risk. To the\r\nwestward, at the head of Wasp Bay, is a small stream of excellent\r\nwater, easily procured.\r\n\r\nSome seal of the fur and hair species are still to be found on\r\nKerguelen\'s Island, and sea elephants abound. The feathered tribes are\r\ndiscovered in great numbers. Penguins are very plenty, and of these\r\nthere are four different kinds. The royal penguin, so called from its\r\nsize and beautiful plumage, is the largest. The upper part of the body\r\nis usually gray, sometimes of a lilach tint; the under portion of the\r\npurest white imaginable. The head is of a glossy and most brilliant\r\nblack, the feet also. The chief beauty of the plumage, however,\r\nconsists in two broad stripes of a gold colour, which pass along from\r\nthe head to the breast. The bill is long, and either pink or bright\r\nscarlet. These birds walk erect, with a stately carriage. They carry\r\ntheir heads high, with their wings drooping like two arms, and, as\r\ntheir tails project from their body in a line with the legs, the\r\nresemblance to a human figure is very striking, and would be apt to\r\ndeceive the spectator at a casual glance or in the gloom of the\r\nevening. The royal penguins which we met with on Kerguelen\'s Land were\r\nrather larger than a goose. The other kinds are the macaroni, the\r\njackass, and the rookery penguin. These are much smaller, less\r\nbeautiful in plumage, and different in other respects.\r\n\r\nBesides the penguin many other birds are here to be found, among which\r\nmay be mentioned seahens, blue peterels, teal, ducks, Port Egmont hens,\r\nshags, Cape pigeons, the nelly, seaswallows, terns, seagulls, Mother\r\nCarey\'s chickens, Mother Carey\'s geese, or the great peterel, and,\r\nlastly, the albatross.\r\n\r\nThe great peterel is as large as the common albatross, and is\r\ncarnivorous. It is frequently called the break-bones, or osprey\r\npeterel. They are not at all shy, and, when properly cooked, are\r\npalatable food. In flying they sometimes sail very close to the surface\r\nof the water, with the wings expanded, without appearing to move them\r\nin the least degree, or make any exertion with them whatever.\r\n\r\nThe albatross is one of the largest and fiercest of the South Sea\r\nbirds. It is of the gull species, and takes its prey on the wing, never\r\ncoming on land except for the purpose of breeding. Between this bird\r\nand the penguin the most singular friendship exists. Their nests are\r\nconstructed with great uniformity, upon a plan concerted between the\r\ntwo species--that of the albatross being placed in the centre of a\r\nlittle square formed by the nests of four penguins. Navigators have\r\nagreed in calling an assemblage of such encampments _a rookery_. These\r\nrookeries have been often described, but, as my readers may not all\r\nhave seen these descriptions, and as I shall have occasion hereafter to\r\nspeak of the penguin and albatross, it will not be amiss to say\r\nsomething here of their mode of building and living.\r\n\r\nWhen the season for incubation arrives, the birds assemble in vast\r\nnumbers, and for some days appear to be deliberating upon the proper\r\ncourse to be pursued. At length they proceed to action. A level piece\r\nof ground is selected, of suitable extent, usually comprising three or\r\nfour acres, and situated as near the sea as possible, being still\r\nbeyond its reach. The spot is chosen with reference to its evenness of\r\nsurface, and that is preferred which is the least encumbered with\r\nstones. This matter being arranged, the birds proceed, with one accord,\r\nand actuated apparently by one mind, to trace out, with mathematical\r\naccuracy, either a square or other parallelogram, as may best suit the\r\nnature of the ground, and of just sufficient size to accommodate easily\r\nall the birds assembled, and no more--in this particular seeming\r\ndetermined upon preventing the access of future stragglers who have not\r\nparticipated in the labour of the encampment. One side of the place\r\nthus marked out runs parallel with the water\'s edge, and is left open\r\nfor ingress or egress.\r\n\r\nHaving defined the limits of the rookery, the colony now begin to clear\r\nit of every species of rubbish, picking up stone by stone, and carrying\r\nthem outside of the lines, and close by them, so as to form a wall on\r\nthe three inland sides. Just within this wall a perfectly level and\r\nsmooth walk is formed, from six to eight feet wide, and extending\r\naround the encampment--thus serving the purpose of a general promenade.\r\n\r\nThe next process is to partition out the whole area into small squares\r\nexactly equal in size. This is done by forming narrow paths, very\r\nsmooth, and crossing each other at right angles throughout the entire\r\nextent of the rookery. At each intersection of these paths the nest of\r\nan albatross is constructed, and a penguin\'s nest in the centre of each\r\nsquare--thus every penguin is surrounded by four albatrosses, and each\r\nalbatross by a like number of penguins. The penguin\'s nest consists of\r\na hole in the earth, very shallow, being only just of sufficient depth\r\nto keep her single egg from rolling. The albatross is somewhat less\r\nsimple in her arrangements, erecting a hillock about a foot high and\r\ntwo in diameter. This is made of earth, seaweed, and shells. On its\r\nsummit she builds her nest.\r\n\r\nThe birds take especial care never to leave their nests unoccupied for\r\nan instant during the period of incubation, or, indeed, until the young\r\nprogeny are sufficiently strong to take care of themselves. While the\r\nmale is absent at sea in search of food, the female remains on duty,\r\nand it is only upon the return of her partner that she ventures abroad.\r\nThe eggs are never left uncovered at all--while one bird leaves the\r\nnest, the other nestling in by its side. This precaution is rendered\r\nnecessary by the thievish propensities prevalent in the rookery, the\r\ninhabitants making no scruple to purloin each other\'s eggs at every\r\ngood opportunity.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are some rookeries in which the penguin and albatross\r\nare the sole population, yet in most of them a variety of oceanic birds\r\nare to be met with, enjoying all the privileges of citizenship, and\r\nscattering their nests here and there, wherever they can find room,\r\nnever interfering, however, with the stations of the larger species.\r\nThe appearance of such encampments, when seen from a distance, is\r\nexceedingly singular. The whole atmosphere just above the settlement is\r\ndarkened with the immense number of the albatross (mingled with the\r\nsmaller tribes) which are continually hovering over it, either going to\r\nthe ocean or returning home. At the same time a crowd of penguins are\r\nto be observed, some passing to and fro in the narrow alleys, and some\r\nmarching, with the military strut so peculiar to them, around the\r\ngeneral promenade-ground which encircles the rookery. In short, survey\r\nit as we will, nothing can be more astonishing than the spirit of\r\nreflection evinced by these feathered beings, and nothing surely can be\r\nbetter calculated to elicit reflection in every well-regulated human\r\nintellect.\r\n\r\nOn the morning after our arrival in Christmas Harbour the chief mate,\r\nMr. Patterson, took the boats, and (although it was somewhat early in\r\nthe season) went in search of seal, leaving the captain and a young\r\nrelation of his on a point of barren land to the westward, they having\r\nsome business, whose nature I could not ascertain, to transact in the\r\ninterior of the island. Captain Guy took with him a bottle, in which\r\nwas a sealed letter, and made his way from the point on which he was\r\nset on shore towards one of the highest peaks in the place. It is\r\nprobable that his design was to leave the letter on that height for\r\nsome vessel which he expected to come after him. As soon as we lost\r\nsight of him we proceeded (Peters and myself being in the mate\'s boat)\r\non our cruise around the coast, looking for seal. In this business we\r\nwere occupied about three weeks, examining with great care every nook\r\nand corner, not only of Kerguelen\'s Land, but of the several small\r\nislands in the vicinity. Our labours, however, were not crowned with\r\nany important success. We saw a great many fur seal, but they were\r\nexceedingly shy, and, with the greatest exertions, we could only\r\nprocure three hundred and fifty skins in all. Sea elephants were\r\nabundant, especially on the western coast of the main island, but of\r\nthese we killed only twenty, and this with great difficulty. On the\r\nsmaller islands we discovered a good many of the hair seal, but did not\r\nmolest them. We returned to the schooner on the eleventh, where we\r\nfound Captain Guy and his nephew, who gave a very bad account of the\r\ninterior, representing it as one of the most dreary and utterly barren\r\ncountries in the world. They had remained two nights on the island,\r\nowing to some misunderstanding, on the part of the second mate, in\r\nregard to the sending a jollyboat from the schooner to take them off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the twelfth we made sail from Christmas Harbour, retracing our way\r\nto the westward, and leaving Marion\'s Island, one of Crozet\'s group, on\r\nthe larboard. We afterward passed Prince Edward\'s Island, leaving it\r\nalso on our left; then, steering more to the northward, made, in\r\nfifteen days, the islands of Tristan d\'Acunha, in latitude 37\xb0 8\' S.,\r\nlongitude 12\xb0 8\' W.\r\n\r\nThis group, now so well known, and which consists of three circular\r\nislands, was first discovered by the Portuguese, and was visited\r\nafterward by the Dutch in 1643, and by the French in 1767. The three\r\nislands together form a triangle, and are distant from each other about\r\nten miles, there being fine open passages between. The land in all of\r\nthem is very high, especially in Tristan d\'Acunha, properly so called.\r\nThis is the largest of the group, being fifteen miles in circumference,\r\nand so elevated that it can be seen in clear weather at the distance of\r\neighty or ninety miles. A part of the land towards the north rises more\r\nthan a thousand feet perpendicularly from the sea. A tableland at this\r\nheight extends back nearly to the centre of the island, and from this\r\ntableland arises a lofty cone like that of Teneriffe. The lower half of\r\nthis cone is clothed with trees of good size, but the upper region is\r\nbarren rock, usually hidden among the clouds, and covered with snow\r\nduring the greater part of the year. There are no shoals or other\r\ndangers about the island, the shores being remarkably bold and the\r\nwater deep. On the northwestern coast is a bay, with a beach of black\r\nsand, where a landing with boats can be easily effected, provided there\r\nbe a southerly wind. Plenty of excellent water may here be readily\r\nprocured; also cod, and other fish, may be taken with hook and line.\r\n\r\nThe next island in point of size, and the most westwardly of the group,\r\nis that called the Inaccessible. Its precise situation is 37\xb0 17\' S.\r\nlatitude, longitude 12\xb0 24\' W. It is seven or eight miles in\r\ncircumference, and on all sides presents a forbidding and precipitous\r\naspect. Its top is perfectly flat, and the whole region is steril,\r\nnothing growing upon it except a few stunted shrubs.\r\n\r\nNightingale Island, the smallest and most southerly, is in latitude 37\xb0\r\n26\' S., longitude 12\xb0 12\' W. Off its southern extremity is a high ledge\r\nof rocky islets; a few also of a similar appearance are seen to the\r\nnortheast. The ground is irregular and steril, and a deep valley\r\npartially separates it.\r\n\r\nThe shores of these islands abound, in the proper season, with sea\r\nlions, sea elephants, the hair and fur seal, together with a great\r\nvariety of oceanic birds. Whales are also plenty in their vicinity.\r\nOwing to the ease with which these various animals were here formerly\r\ntaken, the group has been much visited since its discovery. The Dutch\r\nand French frequented it at a very early period. In 1790, Captain\r\nPatten, of the ship Industry, of Philadelphia, made Tristan d\'Acunha,\r\nwhere he remained seven months (from August, 1790, to April, 1791) for\r\nthe purpose of collecting sealskins. In this time he gathered no less\r\nthan five thousand six hundred, and says that he would have had no\r\ndifficulty in loading a large ship with oil in three weeks. Upon his\r\narrival he found no quadrupeds, with the exception of a few wild\r\ngoats--the island now abounds with all our most valuable domestic\r\nanimals, which have been introduced by subsequent navigators.\r\n\r\nI believe it was not long after Captain Patten\'s visit that Captain\r\nColquhoun, of the American brig Betsey, touched at the largest of the\r\nislands for the purpose of refreshment. He planted onions, potatoes,\r\ncabbages, and a great many other vegetables, an abundance of all which\r\nare now to be met with.\r\n\r\nIn 1811, a Captain Heywood, in the Nereus, visited Tristan. He found\r\nthere three Americans, who were residing upon the islands to prepare\r\nsealskins and oil. One of these men was named Jonathan Lambert, and he\r\ncalled himself the sovereign of the country. He had cleared and\r\ncultivated about sixty acres of land, and turned his attention to\r\nraising the coffee-plant and sugar-cane, with which he had been\r\nfurnished by the American minister at Rio Janeiro. This settlement,\r\nhowever, was finally abandoned, and in 1817 the islands were taken\r\npossession of by the British government, who sent a detachment for that\r\npurpose from the Cape of Good Hope. They did not, however, retain them\r\nlong; but, upon the evacuation of the country as a British possession,\r\ntwo or three English families took up their residence there\r\nindependently of the government. On the twenty-fifth of March, 1824,\r\nthe Berwick, Captain Jeffrey, from London to Van Diemen\'s Land, arrived\r\nat the place, where they found an Englishman of the name of Glass,\r\nformerly a corporal in the British artillery. He claimed to be supreme\r\ngovernor of the islands, and had under his control twenty-one men and\r\nthree women. He gave a very favourable account of the salubrity of the\r\nclimate and of the productiveness of the soil. The population occupied\r\nthemselves chiefly in collecting sealskins and sea elephant oil, with\r\nwhich they traded to the Cape of Good Hope, Glass owning a small\r\nschooner. At the period of our arrival the governor was still a\r\nresident, but his little community had multiplied, there being\r\nfifty-six persons upon Tristan, besides a smaller settlement of seven\r\non Nightingale Island. We had no difficulty in procuring almost every\r\nkind of refreshment which we required--sheep, hogs, bullocks, rabbits,\r\npoultry, goats, fish in great variety, and vegetables were abundant.\r\nHaving come to anchor close in with the large island, in eighteen\r\nfathoms, we took all we wanted on board very conveniently. Captain Guy\r\nalso purchased of Glass five hundred sealskins and some ivory. We\r\nremained here a week, during which the prevailing winds were from the\r\nnorthward and westward, and the weather somewhat hazy. On the fifth of\r\nNovember we made sail to the southward and westward, with the intention\r\nof having a thorough search for a group of islands called the Auroras,\r\nrespecting whose existence a great diversity of opinion has existed.\r\n\r\nThese islands are said to have been discovered as early as 1762, by the\r\ncommander of the ship Aurora. In 1790, Captain Manuel de Oyarvido, in\r\nthe ship Princess, belonging to the Royal Philippine Company, sailed,\r\nas he asserts, directly among them. In 1794, the Spanish corvette\r\nAtrevida went with the determination of ascertaining their precise\r\nsituation, and, in a paper published by the Royal Hydrographical\r\nSociety of Madrid in the year 1809, the following language is used\r\nrespecting this expedition. "The corvette Atrevida practised, in their\r\nimmediate vicinity, from the twenty-first to the twenty-seventh of\r\nJanuary, all the necessary observations, and measured by chronometers\r\nthe difference of longitude between these islands and the port of\r\nSoledad in the Malninas. The islands are three; they are very nearly in\r\nthe same meridian; the centre one is rather low, and the other two may\r\nbe seen at nine leagues distance." The observations made on board the\r\nAtrevida give the following results as the precise situation of each\r\nisland. The most northern is in latitude 52\xb0 37\' 24" S., longitude 47\xb0\r\n43\' 15" W.; the middle one in latitude 53\xb0 2\' 40" S., longitude 47\xb0 55\'\r\n15" W.; and the most southern in latitude 53\xb0 15\' 22" S., longitude 47\xb0\r\n57\' 15" W.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-seventh of January, 1820, Captain James Weddel, of the\r\nBritish navy, sailed from Staten Land also in search of the Auroras. He\r\nreports that, having made the most diligent search, and passed not only\r\nimmediately over the spots indicated by the commander of the Atrevida,\r\nbut in every direction throughout the vicinity of these spots, he could\r\ndiscover no indication of land. These conflicting statements have\r\ninduced other navigators to look out for the islands; and, strange to\r\nsay, while some have sailed through every inch of sea where they are\r\nsupposed to lie without finding them, there have been not a few who\r\ndeclare positively that they have seen them, and even been close in\r\nwith their shores. It was Captain Guy\'s intention to make every\r\nexertion within his power to settle the question so oddly in\r\ndispute.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Among the vessels which at various times have professed to\r\nmeet with the Auroras may be mentioned the ship San Miguel, in 1769;\r\nthe ship Aurora, in 1774; the brig Pearl, in 1779; and the ship\r\nDolores, in 1790. They all agree in giving the mean latitude\r\nfifty-three degrees south.]\r\n\r\nWe kept on our course, between the south and west, with variable\r\nweather, until the twentieth of the month, when we found ourselves on\r\nthe debated ground, being in latitude 53\xb0 15\' S., longitude 47\xb0 58\'\r\nW.--that is to say, very nearly upon the spot indicated as the\r\nsituation of the most southern of the group. Not perceiving any sign of\r\nland, we continued to the westward in the parallel of fifty-three\r\ndegrees south, as far as the meridian of fifty degrees west. We then\r\nstood to the north as far as the parallel of fifty-two degrees south,\r\nwhen we turned to the eastward, and kept our parallel by double\r\naltitudes, morning and evening, and meridian altitudes of the planets\r\nand moon. Having thus gone eastwardly to the meridian of the western\r\ncoast of Georgia, we kept that meridian until we were in the latitude\r\nfrom which we set out. We then took diagonal courses throughout the\r\nentire extent of sea circumscribed, keeping a lookout constantly at the\r\nmasthead, and repeating our examination with the greatest care for a\r\nperiod of three weeks, during which the weather was remarkably pleasant\r\nand fair, with no haze whatsoever. Of course we were thoroughly\r\nsatisfied that, whatever islands might have existed in this vicinity at\r\nany former period, no vestige of them remained at the present day.\r\nSince my return home I find that the same ground was traced over with\r\nequal care in 1822 by Captain Johnson, of the American schooner Henry,\r\nand by Captain Morrell, in the American schooner Wasp--in both cases\r\nwith the same result as in our own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had been Captain Guy\'s original intention, after satisfying himself\r\nabout the Auroras, to proceed through the Strait of Magellan, and up\r\nalong the western coast of Patagonia; but information received at\r\nTristan d\'Acunha induced him to steer to the southward, in the hope of\r\nfalling in with some small islands said to lie about the parallel of\r\n60\xb0 S., longitude 41\xb0 20\' W. In the event of his not discovering these\r\nlands, he designed, should the season prove favourable, to push on\r\ntowards the pole. Accordingly, on the twelfth of December, we made sail\r\nin that direction. On the eighteenth we found ourselves about the\r\nstation indicated by Glass, and cruised for three days in that\r\nneighbourhood without finding any traces of the islands he had\r\nmentioned. On the twenty-first, the weather being unusually pleasant,\r\nwe again made sail to the southward, with the resolution of penetrating\r\nin that course as far as possible. Before entering upon this portion of\r\nmy narrative, it may be as well, for the information of those readers\r\nwho have paid little attention to the progress of discovery in these\r\nregions, to give some brief account of the very few attempts at\r\nreaching the southern pole which have hitherto been made.\r\n\r\nThat of Captain Cook was the first of which we have any distinct\r\naccount. In 1772 he sailed to the south in the Resolution, accompanied\r\nby Lieutenant Furneaux in the Adventure. In December he found himself\r\nas far as the fifty-eighth parallel of south latitude, and in longitude\r\n26\xb0 57\' E. Here he met with narrow fields of ice, about eight or ten\r\ninches thick, and running northwest and southeast. This ice was in\r\nlarge cakes, and usually it was packed so closely that the vessels had\r\ngreat difficulty in forcing a passage. At this period Captain Cook\r\nsupposed, from the vast number of birds to be seen, and from other\r\nindications, that he was in the near vicinity of land. He kept on to\r\nthe southward, the weather being exceedingly cold, until he reached the\r\nsixty-fourth parallel, in longitude 38\xb0 14\' E. Here he had mild\r\nweather, with gentle breezes, for five days, the thermometer being at\r\nthirty-six. In January, 1773, the vessels crossed the Antarctic circle,\r\nbut did not succeed in penetrating much farther; for, upon reaching\r\nlatitude 67\xb0 15\', they found all farther progress impeded by an immense\r\nbody of ice, extending all along the southern horizon as far as the eye\r\ncould reach. This ice was of every variety--and some large floes of it,\r\nmiles in extent, formed a compact mass, rising eighteen or twenty feet\r\nabove the water. It being late in the season, and no hope entertained\r\nof rounding these obstructions, Captain Cook now reluctantly turned to\r\nthe northward.\r\n\r\nIn the November following he renewed his search in the Antarctic. In\r\nlatitude 59\xb0 40\' he met with a strong current setting to the southward.\r\nIn December, when the vessels were in latitude 67\xb0 31\', longitude 142\xb0\r\n54\' W., the cold was excessive, with heavy gales and fog. Here also\r\nbirds were abundant; the albatross, the penguin, and the peterel\r\nespecially. In latitude 70\xb0 23\' some large islands of ice were\r\nencountered, and shortly afterward, the clouds to the southward were\r\nobserved to be of a snowy whiteness, indicating the vicinity of field\r\nice. In latitude 71\xb0 10\', longitude 106\xb0 54\' W., the navigators were\r\nstopped, as before, by an immense frozen expanse, which filled the\r\nwhole area of the southern horizon. The northern edge of this expanse\r\nwas ragged and broken, so firmly wedged together as to be utterly\r\nimpassable, and extending about a mile to the southward. Behind it the\r\nfrozen surface was comparatively smooth for some distance, until\r\nterminated in the extreme back-ground by gigantic ranges of ice\r\nmountains, the one towering above the other. Captain Cook concluded\r\nthat this vast field reached the southern pole or was joined to a\r\ncontinent. Mr. J. N. Reynolds, whose great exertions and perseverance\r\nhave at length succeeded in getting set on foot a national expedition,\r\npartly for the purpose of exploring these regions, thus speaks of the\r\nattempt of the Resolution. "We are not surprised that Captain Cook was\r\nunable to go beyond 71\xb0 10\', but we are astonished that he did attain\r\nthat point on the meridian of 106\xb0 54\' west longitude. Palmer\'s Land\r\nlies south of the Shetland, latitude sixty-four degrees, and tends to\r\nthe southward and westward farther than any navigator has yet\r\npenetrated. Cook was standing for this land when his progress was\r\narrested by the ice; which, we apprehend, must always be the case in\r\nthat point, and so early in the season as the sixth of January--and we\r\nshould not be surprised if a portion of the icy mountains described was\r\nattached to the main body of Palmer\'s Land, or to some other portions\r\nof land lying farther to the southward and westward."\r\n\r\nIn 1803, Captains Kreutzenstern and Lisiausky were despatched by\r\nAlexander of Russia for the purpose of circumnavigating the globe. In\r\nendeavouring to get south, they made no farther than 59\xb0 58\', in\r\nlongitude 70\xb0 15\' W. They here met with strong currents setting\r\neastwardly. Whales were abundant, but they saw no ice. In regard to\r\nthis voyage, Mr. Reynolds observes that, if Kreutzenstern had arrived\r\nwhere he did earlier in the season, he must have encountered ice--it\r\nwas March when he reached the latitude specified. The winds prevailing,\r\nas they do, from the southward and westward, had carried the floes,\r\naided by currents, into that icy region bounded on the north by\r\nGeorgia, east by Sandwich Land and the South Orkneys, and west by the\r\nSouth Shetland Islands.\r\n\r\nIn 1822, Captain James Weddell, of the British navy, with two very\r\nsmall vessels, penetrated farther to the south than any previous\r\nnavigator, and this too, without encountering extraordinary\r\ndifficulties. He states that although he was frequently hemmed in by\r\nice _before_ reaching the seventy-second parallel, yet, upon attaining\r\nit, not a particle was to be discovered, and that, upon arriving at the\r\nlatitude of 74\xb0 15\', no fields, and only three islands of ice were\r\nvisible. It is somewhat remarkable that, although vast flocks of birds\r\nwere seen, and other usual indications of land, and although, south of\r\nthe Shetlands, unknown coasts were observed from the masthead tending\r\nsouthwardly, Weddell discourages the idea of land existing in the polar\r\nregions of the south.\r\n\r\nOn the eleventh of January, 1823, Captain Benjamin Morrell, of the\r\nAmerican schooner Wasp, sailed from Kerguelen\'s Land with a view of\r\npenetrating as far south as possible. On the first of February he found\r\nhimself in latitude 64\xb0 52\' S., longitude 118\xb0 27\' E. The following\r\npassage is extracted from his journal of that date. "The wind soon\r\nfreshened to an eleven-knot breeze, and we embraced this opportunity of\r\nmaking to the west; being however convinced that the farther we went\r\nsouth beyond latitude sixty-four degrees the less ice was to be\r\napprehended, we steered a little to the southward, until we crossed the\r\nAntarctic circle, and were in latitude 69\xb0 15\' E. In this latitude\r\nthere was _no field ice_, and very few ice islands in sight."\r\n\r\nUnder the date of March fourteenth I find also this entry. "The sea was\r\nnow entirely free of field ice, and there were not more than a dozen\r\nice islands in sight. At the same time the temperature of the air and\r\nwater was at least thirteen degrees higher (more mild) than we had ever\r\nfound it between the parallels of sixty and sixty-two south. We were\r\nnow in latitude 70\xb0 14\' S., and the temperature of the air was\r\nforty-seven, and that of the water forty-four. In this situation I\r\nfound the variation to be 14\xb0 27\' easterly, per azimuth.... I have\r\nseveral times passed within the Antarctic circle on different\r\nmeridians, and have uniformly found the temperature, both of the air\r\nand the water, to become more and more mild the farther I advanced\r\nbeyond the sixty-fifth degree of south latitude, and that the variation\r\ndecreases in the same proportion. While north of this latitude, say\r\nbetween sixty and sixty-five south, we frequently had great difficulty\r\nin finding a passage for the vessel between the immense and almost\r\ninnumerable ice islands, some of which were from one to two miles in\r\ncircumference, and more than five hundred feet above the surface of the\r\nwater."\r\n\r\nBeing nearly destitute of fuel and water, and without proper\r\ninstruments, it being also late in the season, Captain Morrell was now\r\nobliged to put back, without attempting any farther progress to the\r\nsouthward, although an entirely open sea lay before him. He expresses\r\nthe opinion that, had not these overruling considerations obliged him\r\nto retreat, he could have penetrated, if not to the pole itself, at\r\nleast to the eighty-fifth parallel. I have given his ideas respecting\r\nthese matters somewhat at length, that the reader may have an\r\nopportunity of seeing how far they were borne out by my own subsequent\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nIn 1831, Captain Briscoe, in the employ of the Messieurs Enderby,\r\nwhale-ship owners of London, sailed in the brig Lively for the South\r\nSeas, accompanied by the cutter Tula. On the twenty-eighth of February,\r\nbeing in latitude 66\xb0 30\' S., longitude 47\xb0 31\' E., he descried land,\r\nand "clearly discovered through the snow the black peaks of a range of\r\nmountains running E. S. E." He remained in this neighbourhood during\r\nthe whole of the following month, but was unable to approach the coast\r\nnearer than within ten leagues, owing to the boisterous state of the\r\nweather. Finding it impossible to make farther discovery during this\r\nseason, he returned northward to winter in Van Diemen\'s Land.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 1832 he again proceeded southwardly, and on the\r\nfourth of February land was seen to the southeast in latitude 67\xb0 15\',\r\nlongitude 69\xb0 29\' W. This was soon found to be an island near the\r\nheadland of the country he had first discovered. On the twenty-first of\r\nthe month he succeeded in landing on the latter, and took possession of\r\nit in the name of William IV., calling it Adelaide\'s Island, in honour\r\nof the English queen. These particulars being made known to the Royal\r\nGeographical Society of London, the conclusion was drawn by that body\r\n"that there is a continuous tract of land extending from 47\xb0 30\' E. to\r\n69\xb0 29\' W. longitude, running the parallel of from sixty-six to\r\nsixty-seven degrees south latitude." In respect to this conclusion Mr.\r\nReynolds observes, "In the correctness of it we by no means concur; nor\r\ndo the discoveries of Briscoe warrant any such inference. It was within\r\nthese limits that Weddell proceeded south on a meridian to the east of\r\nGeorgia, Sandwich Land, and the South Orkney and Shetland Islands." My\r\nown experience will be found to testify most directly to the falsity of\r\nthe conclusion arrived at by the society.\r\n\r\nThese are the principal attempts which have been made at penetrating to\r\na high southern latitude, and it will now be seen that there remained,\r\nprevious to the voyage of the Jane, nearly three hundred degrees of\r\nlongitude in which the Antarctic circle had not been crossed at all. Of\r\ncourse a wide field lay before us for discovery, and it was with\r\nfeelings of most intense interest that I heard Captain Guy express his\r\nresolution of pushing boldly to the southward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe kept our course southwardly for four days after giving up the search\r\nfor Glass\'s Islands, without meeting with any ice at all. On the\r\ntwenty-sixth, at noon, we were in latitude 63\xb0 23\' S., longitude 41\xb0\r\n25\' W. We now saw several large ice islands, and a floe of field ice,\r\nnot, however, of any great extent. The winds generally blew from the\r\nsoutheast, or the northeast, but were very light. Whenever we had a\r\nwesterly wind, which was seldom, it was invariably attended with a rain\r\nsquall. Every day we had more or less snow. The thermometer, on the\r\ntwenty-seventh, stood at thirty-five.\r\n\r\n_January 1, 1828._ This day we found ourselves completely hemmed in by\r\nthe ice, and our prospects looked cheerless indeed. A strong gale blew,\r\nduring the whole forenoon, from the northeast, and drove large cakes of\r\nthe drift against the rudder and counter with such violence that we all\r\ntrembled for the consequences. Towards evening, the gale still blowing\r\nwith fury, a large field in front separated, and we were enabled, by\r\ncarrying a press of sail, to force a passage through the smaller flakes\r\ninto some open water beyond. As we approached this space we took in\r\nsail by degrees, and having at length got clear, lay to under a single\r\nreefed foresail.\r\n\r\n_January 2._ We had now tolerably pleasant weather. At noon we found\r\nourselves in latitude 69\xb0 10\' S., longitude 42\xb0 20\' W., having crossed\r\nthe Antarctic circle. Very little ice was to be seen to the southward,\r\nalthough large fields of it lay behind us. This day we rigged some\r\nsounding gear, using a large iron pot capable of holding twenty\r\ngallons, and a line of two hundred fathoms. We found the current\r\nsetting to the north, about a quarter of a mile per hour. The\r\ntemperature of the air was now about thirty-three. Here we found the\r\nvariation to be 14\xb0 28\' easterly, per azimuth.\r\n\r\n_January 5._ We had still held on to the southward without any very\r\ngreat impediments. On this morning, however, being in latitude 73\xb0 15\'\r\nE., longitude 42\xb0 10\' W., we were again brought to a stand by an\r\nimmense expanse of firm ice. We saw, nevertheless, much open water to\r\nthe southward, and felt no doubt of being able to reach it eventually.\r\nStanding to the eastward along the edge of the floe, we at length came\r\nto a passage of about a mile in width, through which we warped our way\r\nby sundown. The sea in which we now were was thickly covered with ice\r\nislands, but had no field ice, and we pushed on boldly as before. The\r\ncold did not seem to increase, although we had snow very frequently,\r\nand now and then hail squalls of great violence. Immense flocks of the\r\nalbatross flew over the schooner this day, going from southeast to\r\nnorthwest.\r\n\r\n_January 7._ The sea still remained pretty well open, so that we had no\r\ndifficulty in holding on our course. To the westward we saw some\r\nicebergs of incredible size, and in the afternoon passed very near one\r\nwhose summit could not have been less than four hundred fathoms from\r\nthe surface of the ocean. Its girth was probably, at the base, three\r\nquarters of a league, and several streams of water were running from\r\ncrevices in its sides. We remained in sight of this island two days,\r\nand then only lost it in a fog.\r\n\r\n_January 10._ Early this morning we had the misfortune to lose a man\r\noverboard. He was an American, named Peter Vredenburgh, a native of\r\nNew-York, and was one of the most valuable hands on board the schooner.\r\nIn going over the bows his foot slipped, and he fell between two cakes\r\nof ice, never rising again. At noon of this day we were in latitude 78\xb0\r\n30\', longitude 40\xb0 15\' W. The cold was now excessive, and we had hail\r\nsqualls continually from the northward and eastward. In this direction\r\nalso we saw several more immense icebergs, and the whole horizon to the\r\neastward appeared to be blocked up with field ice, rising in tiers, one\r\nmass above the other. Some driftwood floated by during the evening, and\r\na great quantity of birds flew over, among which were Nellies,\r\npeterels, albatrosses, and a large bird of a brilliant blue plumage.\r\nThe variation here, per azimuth, was less than it had been previously\r\nto our passing the Antarctic circle.\r\n\r\n_January 12._ Our passage to the south again looked doubtful, as\r\nnothing was to be seen in the direction of the pole but one apparently\r\nlimitless floe, backed by absolute mountains of ragged ice, one\r\nprecipice of which arose frowningly above the other. We stood to the\r\nwestward until the fourteenth, in the hope of finding an entrance.\r\n\r\n_January 14._ This morning we reached the western extremity of the\r\nfield which had impeded us, and, weathering it, came to an open sea,\r\nwithout a particle of ice. Upon sounding with two hundred fathoms, we\r\nhere found a current setting southwardly at the rate of half a mile per\r\nhour. The temperature of the air was forty-seven, that of the water\r\nthirty-four. We now sailed to the southward, without meeting any\r\ninterruption of moment until the sixteenth, when, at noon, we were in\r\nlatitude 81\xb0 21\', longitude 42\xb0 W. We here again sounded, and found a\r\ncurrent setting still southwardly, and at the rate of three quarters of\r\na mile per hour. The variation per azimuth had diminished, and the\r\ntemperature of the air was mild and pleasant, the thermometer being as\r\nhigh as fifty-one. At this period not a particle of ice was to be\r\ndiscovered. All hands on board now felt certain of attaining the pole.\r\n\r\n_January 17._ This day was full of incident. Innumerable flights of\r\nbirds flew over us from the southward, and several were shot from the\r\ndeck; one of them, a species of pelican, proved to be excellent eating.\r\nAbout midday a small floe of ice was seen from the masthead off the\r\nlarboard bow, and upon it there appeared to be some large animal. As\r\nthe weather was good and nearly calm, Captain Guy ordered out two of\r\nthe boats to see what it was. Dirk Peters and myself accompanied the\r\nmate in the larger boat. Upon coming up with the floe, we perceived\r\nthat it was in the possession of a gigantic creature of the race of the\r\nArctic bear, but far exceeding in size the largest of these animals.\r\nBeing well armed, we made no scruple of attacking it at once. Several\r\nshots were fired in quick succession, the most of which took effect,\r\napparently, in the head and body. Nothing discouraged, however, the\r\nmonster threw himself from the ice, and swam, with open jaws, to the\r\nboat in which were Peters and myself. Owing to the confusion which\r\nensued among us at this unexpected turn of the adventure, no person was\r\nready immediately with a second shot, and the bear had actually\r\nsucceeded in getting half his vast bulk across our gunwale, and seizing\r\none of the men by the small of his back, before any efficient means\r\nwere taken to repel him. In this extremity nothing but the promptness\r\nand agility of Peters saved us from destruction. Leaping upon the back\r\nof the huge beast, he plunged the blade of a knife behind the neck,\r\nreaching the spinal marrow at a blow. The brute tumbled into the sea\r\nlifeless, and without a struggle, rolling over Peters as he fell. The\r\nlatter soon recovered himself, and a rope being thrown him, he secured\r\nthe carcass before entering the boat. We then returned in triumph to\r\nthe schooner, towing our trophy behind us. This bear, upon\r\nadmeasurement, proved to be full fifteen feet in his greatest length.\r\nHis wool was perfectly white, and very coarse, curling tightly. The\r\neyes were of a blood red, and larger than those of the Arctic bear--the\r\nsnout also more rounded, rather resembling the snout of the bulldog.\r\nThe meat was tender, but excessively rank and fishy, although the men\r\ndevoured it with avidity, and declared it excellent eating.\r\n\r\nScarcely had we got our prize alongside, when the man at the masthead\r\ngave the joyful shout of _"land on the starboard bow!"_ All hands were\r\nnow upon the alert, and, a breeze springing up very opportunely from\r\nthe northward and eastward, we were soon close in with the coast. It\r\nproved to be a low rocky islet, of about a league in circumference, and\r\naltogether destitute of vegetation, if we except a species of prickly\r\npear. In approaching it from the northward, a singular ledge of rock is\r\nseen projecting into the sea, and bearing a strong resemblance to\r\ncorded bales of cotton. Around this ledge to the westward is a small\r\nbay, at the bottom of which our boats effected a convenient landing.\r\n\r\nIt did not take us long to explore every portion of the island, but,\r\nwith one exception, we found nothing worthy of observation. In the\r\nsouthern extremity, we picked up near the shore, half buried in a pile\r\nof loose stones, a piece of wood, which seemed to have formed the prow\r\nof a canoe. There had been evidently some attempt at carving upon it,\r\nand Captain Guy fancied that he made out the figure of a tortoise, but\r\nthe resemblance did not strike me very forcibly. Besides this prow, if\r\nsuch it were, we found no other token that any living creature had ever\r\nbeen here before. Around the coast we discovered occasional small floes\r\nof ice--but these were very few. The exact situation of this islet (to\r\nwhich Captain Guy gave the name of Bennet\'s Islet, in honour of his\r\npartner in the ownership of the schooner) is 82\xb0 50\' S. latitude, 42\xb0\r\n20\' W. longitude.\r\n\r\nWe had now advanced to the southward more than eight degrees farther\r\nthan any previous navigators, and the sea still lay perfectly open\r\nbefore us. We found, too, that the variation uniformly decreased as we\r\nproceeded, and, what was still more surprising, that the temperature of\r\nthe air, and latterly of the water, became milder. The weather might\r\neven be called pleasant, and we had a steady but very gentle breeze\r\nalways from some northern point of the compass. The sky was usually\r\nclear, with now and then a slight appearance of thin vapour in the\r\nsouthern horizon--this, however, was invariably of brief duration. Two\r\ndifficulties alone presented themselves to our view; we were getting\r\nshort of fuel, and symptoms of scurvy had occurred among several of the\r\ncrew. These considerations began to impress upon Captain Guy the\r\nnecessity of returning, and he spoke of it frequently. For my own part,\r\nconfident as I was of soon arriving at land of some description upon\r\nthe course we were pursuing, and having every reason to believe, from\r\npresent appearances, that we should not find it the steril soil met\r\nwith in the higher Arctic latitudes, I warmly pressed upon him the\r\nexpediency of persevering, at least for a few days longer, in the\r\ndirection we were now holding. So tempting an opportunity of solving\r\nthe great problem in regard to an Antarctic continent had never yet\r\nbeen afforded to man, and I confess that I felt myself bursting with\r\nindignation at the timid and ill-timed suggestions of our commander. I\r\nbelieve, indeed, that what I could not refrain from saying to him on\r\nthis head had the effect of inducing him to push on. While, therefore,\r\nI cannot but lament the most unfortunate and bloody events which\r\nimmediately arose from my advice, I must still be allowed to feel some\r\ndegree of gratification at having been instrumental, however remotely,\r\nin opening to the eye of science one of the most intensely exciting\r\nsecrets which has ever engrossed its attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 18._ This morning[4] we continued to the southward, with the\r\nsame pleasant weather as before. The sea was entirely smooth, the air\r\ntolerably warm and from the northeast, the temperature of the water\r\nfifty-three. We now again got our sounding-gear in order, and, with a\r\nhundred and fifty fathoms of line, found the current setting towards\r\nthe pole at the rate of a mile an hour. This constant tendency to the\r\nsouthward, both in the wind and current, caused some degree of\r\nspeculation, and even of alarm, in different quarters of the schooner,\r\nand I saw distinctly that no little impression had been made upon the\r\nmind of Captain Guy. He was exceedingly sensitive to ridicule, however,\r\nand I finally succeeded in laughing him out of his apprehensions. The\r\nvariation was now very trivial. In the course of the day we saw several\r\nlarge whales of the right species, and innumerable flights of the\r\nalbatross passed over the vessel. We also picked up a bush, full of red\r\nberries, like those of the hawthorn, and the carcass of a\r\nsingular-looking land-animal. It was three feet in length, and but six\r\ninches in height, with four very short legs, the feet armed with long\r\nclaws of a brilliant scarlet, and resembling coral in substance. The\r\nbody was covered with a straight silky hair, perfectly white. The tail\r\nwas peaked like that of a rat, and about a foot and a half long. The\r\nhead resembled a cat\'s, with the exception of the ears--these were\r\nflapped like the ears of a dog. The _teeth_ were of the same brilliant\r\nscarlet as the claws.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The terms _morning_ and _evening_, which I have made use\r\nof to avoid confusion in my narrative, as far as possible, must not, of\r\ncourse, be taken in their ordinary sense. For a long time past we had\r\nhad no night at all, the daylight being continual. The dates throughout\r\nare according to nautical time, and the bearings must be understood as\r\nper compass. I would also remark in this place, that I cannot, in the\r\nfirst portion of what is here written, pretend to strict accuracy in\r\nrespect to dates, or latitudes and longitudes, having kept no regular\r\njournal until after the period of which this first portion treats. In\r\nmany instances I have relied altogether upon memory.]\r\n\r\n_January 19._ To-day, being in latitude 83\xb0 20\', longitude 43\xb0 5\' W.\r\n(the sea being of an extraordinarily dark colour), we again saw land\r\nfrom the masthead, and, upon a closer scrutiny, found it to be one of a\r\ngroup of very large islands. The shore was precipitous, and the\r\ninterior seemed to be well wooded, a circumstance which occasioned us\r\ngreat joy. In about four hours from our first discovering the land we\r\ncame to anchor in ten fathoms, sandy bottom, a league from the coast,\r\nas a high surf, with strong ripples here and there, rendered a nearer\r\napproach of doubtful expediency. The two largest boats were now ordered\r\nout, and a party, well armed (among whom were Peters and myself),\r\nproceeded to look for an opening in the reef which appeared to encircle\r\nthe island. After searching about for some time, we discovered an\r\ninlet, which we were entering, when we saw four large canoes put off\r\nfrom the shore, filled with men who seemed to be well armed. We waited\r\nfor them to come up, and, as they moved with great rapidity, they were\r\nsoon within hail. Captain Guy now held up a white handkerchief on the\r\nblade of an oar, when the strangers made a full stop, and commenced a\r\nloud jabbering all at once, intermingled with occasional shouts, in\r\nwhich we could distinguish the words _Anamoo-moo!_ and _Lama-Lama!_\r\nThey continued this for at least half an hour, during which we had a\r\ngood opportunity of observing their appearance.\r\n\r\nIn the four canoes, which might have been fifty feet long and five\r\nbroad, there were a hundred and ten savages in all. They were about the\r\nordinary stature of Europeans, but of a more muscular and brawny frame.\r\nTheir complexion a jet black, with thick and long woolly hair. They\r\nwere clothed in skins of an unknown black animal, shaggy and silky, and\r\nmade to fit the body with some degree of skill, the hair being inside,\r\nexcept where turned out about the neck, wrists, and ankles. Their arms\r\nconsisted principally of clubs, of a dark, and apparently very heavy\r\nwood. Some spears, however, were observed among them, headed with\r\nflint, and a few slings. The bottoms of the canoes were full of black\r\nstones about the size of a large egg.\r\n\r\nWhen they had concluded their harangue (for it was clear they intended\r\ntheir jabbering for such), one of them who seemed to be the chief stood\r\nup in the prow of his canoe, and made signs for us to bring our boats\r\nalongside of him. This hint we pretended not to understand, thinking it\r\nthe wiser plan to maintain, if possible, the interval between us, as\r\ntheir number more than quadrupled our own. Finding this to be the case,\r\nthe chief ordered the three other canoes to hold back, while he\r\nadvanced towards us with his own. As soon as he came up with us he\r\nleaped on board the largest of our boats, and seated himself by the\r\nside of Captain Guy, pointing at the same time to the schooner, and\r\nrepeating the words _Anamoo-moo!_ and _Lama-Lama!_ We now put back to\r\nthe vessel, the four canoes following at a little distance.\r\n\r\nUpon getting alongside the chief evinced symptoms of extreme surprise\r\nand delight, clapping his hands, slapping his thighs and breast, and\r\nlaughing obstreperously. His followers behind joined in his merriment,\r\nand for some minutes the din was so excessive as to be absolutely\r\ndeafening. Quiet being at length restored, Captain Guy ordered the\r\nboats to be hoisted up, as a necessary precaution, and gave the chief\r\n(whose name we soon found to be _Too-wit_) to understand that we could\r\nadmit no more than twenty of his men on deck at one time. With this\r\narrangement he appeared perfectly satisfied, and gave some directions\r\nto the canoes, when one of them approached, the rest remaining about\r\nfifty yards off. Twenty of the savages now got on board, and proceeded\r\nto ramble over every part of the deck, and scramble about among the\r\nrigging, making themselves much at home, and examining every article\r\nwith great inquisitiveness.\r\n\r\nIt was quite evident that they had never before seen any of the white\r\nrace--from whose complexion, indeed, they appeared to recoil. They\r\nbelieved the Jane to be a living creature, and seemed to be afraid of\r\nhurting it with the points of their spears, carefully turning them up.\r\nOur crew were much amused with the conduct of Too-wit in one instance.\r\nThe cook was splitting some wood near the galley, and, by accident,\r\nstruck his axe into the deck, making a gash of considerable depth. The\r\nchief immediately ran up, and pushing the cook on one side rather\r\nroughly, commenced a half whine, half howl, strongly indicative of\r\nsympathy in what he considered the sufferings of the schooner, patting\r\nand smoothing the gash with his hand, and washing it from a bucket of\r\nseawater which stood by. This was a degree of ignorance for which we\r\nwere not prepared, and for my part I could not help thinking some of it\r\naffected.\r\n\r\nWhen the visiters had satisfied, as well as they could, their curiosity\r\nin regard to our upper works, they were admitted below, when their\r\namazement exceeded all bounds. Their astonishment now appeared to be\r\nfar too deep for words, for they roamed about in silence, broken only\r\nby low ejaculations. The arms afforded them much food for speculation,\r\nand they were suffered to handle and examine them at leisure. I do not\r\nbelieve that they had the least suspicion of their actual use, but\r\nrather took them for idols, seeing the care we had of them, and the\r\nattention with which we watched their movements while handling them. At\r\nthe great guns their wonder was redoubled. They approached them with\r\nevery mark of the profoundest reverence and awe, but forbore to examine\r\nthem minutely. There were two large mirrors in the cabin, and here was\r\nthe acme of their amazement. Too-wit was the first to approach them,\r\nand he had got in the middle of the cabin, with his face to one and his\r\nback to the other, before he fairly perceived them. Upon raising his\r\neyes and seeing his reflected self in the glass, I thought the savage\r\nwould go mad; but, upon turning short round to make a retreat, and\r\nbeholding himself a second time in the opposite direction, I was afraid\r\nhe would expire upon the spot. No persuasions could prevail upon him to\r\ntake another look; but, throwing himself upon the floor, with his face\r\nburied in his hands, he remained thus until we were obliged to drag him\r\nupon deck.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the savages were admitted on board in this manner, twenty\r\nat a time, Too-wit being suffered to remain during the entire period.\r\nWe saw no disposition to thievery among them, nor did we miss a single\r\narticle after their departure. Throughout the whole of their visit they\r\nevinced the most friendly manner. There were, however, some points in\r\ntheir demeanour which we found it impossible to understand: for\r\nexample, we could not get them to approach several very harmless\r\nobjects--such as the schooner\'s sails, an egg, an open book, or a pan\r\nof flour. We endeavoured to ascertain if they had among them any\r\narticles which might be turned to account in the way of traffic, but\r\nfound great difficulty in being comprehended. We made out,\r\nnevertheless, what greatly astonished us, that the islands abounded in\r\nthe large tortoise of the Gallipagos, one of which we saw in the canoe\r\nof Too-wit. We saw also some _biche de mer_ in the hands of one of the\r\nsavages, who was greedily devouring it in its natural state. These\r\nanomalies, for they were such when considered in regard to the\r\nlatitude, induced Captain Guy to wish for a thorough investigation of\r\nthe country, in the hope of making a profitable speculation in his\r\ndiscovery. For my own part, anxious as I was to know something more of\r\nthese islands, I was still more earnestly bent on prosecuting the\r\nvoyage to the southward without delay. We had now fine weather, but\r\nthere was no telling how long it would last; and being already in the\r\neighty-fourth parallel, with an open sea before us, a current setting\r\nstrongly to the southward, and the wind fair, I could not listen with\r\nany patience to a proposition of stopping longer than was absolutely\r\nnecessary for the health of the crew and the taking on board a proper\r\nsupply of fuel and fresh provisions. I represented to the captain that\r\nwe might easily make this group on our return, and winter here in the\r\nevent of being blocked up by the ice. He at length came into my views\r\n(for in some way, hardly known to myself, I had acquired much influence\r\nover him), and it was finally resolved that, even in the event of our\r\nfinding _biche de mer_, we should only stay here a week to recruit, and\r\nthen push on to the southward while we might. Accordingly we made every\r\nnecessary preparation, and, under the guidance of Too-wit, got the Jane\r\nthrough the reef in safety, coming to anchor about a mile from the\r\nshore, in an excellent bay, completely landlocked, on the southeastern\r\ncoast of the main island, and in ten fathoms of water, black sandy\r\nbottom. At the head of this bay there were three fine springs (we were\r\ntold) of good water, and we saw abundance of wood in the vicinity. The\r\nfour canoes followed us in, keeping, however, at a respectful distance.\r\nToo-wit himself remained on board, and, upon our dropping anchor,\r\ninvited us to accompany him on shore, and visit his village in the\r\ninterior. To this Captain Guy consented; and ten savages being left on\r\nboard as hostages, a party of us, twelve in all, got in readiness to\r\nattend the chief. We took care to be well armed, yet without evincing\r\nany distrust. The schooner had her guns run out, her boarding-nettings\r\nup, and every other proper precaution was taken to guard against\r\nsurprise. Directions were left with the chief mate to admit no person\r\non board during our absence, and, in the event of our not appearing in\r\ntwelve hours, to send the cutter, with a swivel, round the island in\r\nsearch of us.\r\n\r\nAt every step we took inland the conviction forced itself upon us that\r\nwe were in a country differing essentially from any hitherto visited by\r\ncivilized men. We saw nothing with which we had been formerly\r\nconversant. The trees resembled no growth of either the torrid, the\r\ntemperate, or the northern frigid zones, and were altogether unlike\r\nthose of the lower southern latitudes we had already traversed. The\r\nvery rocks were novel in their mass, their colour, and their\r\nstratification; and the streams themselves, utterly incredible as it\r\nmay appear, had so little in common with those of other climates, that\r\nwe were scrupulous of tasting them, and, indeed, had difficulty in\r\nbringing ourselves to believe that their qualities were purely those of\r\nnature. At a small brook which crossed our path (the first we had\r\nreached) Too-wit and his attendants halted to drink. On account of the\r\nsingular character of the water, we refused to taste it, supposing it\r\nto be polluted; and it was not until some time afterward we came to\r\nunderstand that such was the appearance of the streams throughout the\r\nwhole group. I am at a loss to give a distinct idea of the nature of\r\nthis liquid, and cannot do so without many words. Although it flowed\r\nwith rapidity in all declivities where common water would do so, yet\r\nnever, except when falling in a cascade, had it the customary\r\nappearance of _limpidity_. It was, nevertheless, in point of fact, as\r\nperfectly limpid as any limestone water in existence, the difference\r\nbeing only in appearance. At first sight, and especially in cases where\r\nlittle declivity was found, it bore resemblance, as regards\r\nconsistency, to a thick infusion of gum Arabic in common water. But\r\nthis was only the least remarkable of its extraordinary qualities. It\r\nwas _not_ colourless, nor was it of any one uniform colour--presenting\r\nto the eye, as it flowed, every possible shade of purple, like the hues\r\nof a changeable silk. This variation in shade was produced in a manner\r\nwhich excited as profound astonishment in the minds of our party as the\r\nmirror had done in the case of Too-wit. Upon collecting a basinful, and\r\nallowing it to settle thoroughly, we perceived that the whole mass of\r\nliquid was made up of a number of distinct veins, each of a distinct\r\nhue; that these veins did not commingle; and that their cohesion was\r\nperfect in regard to their own particles among themselves, and\r\nimperfect in regard to neighbouring veins. Upon passing the blade of a\r\nknife athwart the veins, the water closed over it immediately, as with\r\nus, and also, in withdrawing it, all traces of the passage of the knife\r\nwere instantly obliterated. If, however, the blade was passed down\r\naccurately between two veins, a perfect separation was effected, which\r\nthe power of cohesion did not immediately rectify. The phenomena of\r\nthis water formed the first definite link in that vast chain of\r\napparent miracles with which I was destined to be at length encircled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were nearly three hours in reaching the village, it being more than\r\nnine miles in the interior, and the path lying through a rugged\r\ncountry. As we passed along, the party of Too-wit (the whole hundred\r\nand ten savages of the canoes) was momentarily strengthened by smaller\r\ndetachments, of from two to six or seven, which joined us, as if by\r\naccident, at different turns in the road. There appeared so much of\r\nsystem in this that I could not help feeling distrust, and I spoke to\r\nCaptain Guy of my apprehensions. It was now too late, however, to\r\nrecede, and we concluded that our best security lay in evincing a\r\nperfect confidence in the good faith of Too-wit. We accordingly went\r\non, keeping a wary eye upon the manoeuvres of the savages, and not\r\npermitting them to divide our numbers by pushing in between. In this\r\nway, passing through a precipitous ravine, we at length reached what we\r\nwere told was the only collection of habitations upon the island. As we\r\ncame in sight of them, the chief set up a shout, and frequently\r\nrepeated the word _Klock-Klock_; which we supposed to be the name of\r\nthe village, or perhaps the generic name for villages.\r\n\r\nThe dwellings were of the most miserable description imaginable, and,\r\nunlike those of even the lowest of the savage races with which mankind\r\nare acquainted, were of no uniform plan. Some of them (and these we\r\nfound belonged to the _Wampoos_ or _Yampoos_, the great men of the\r\nland) consisted of a tree cut down at about four feet from the root,\r\nwith a large black skin thrown over it, and hanging in loose folds upon\r\nthe ground. Under this the savage nestled. Others were formed by means\r\nof rough limbs of trees, with the withered foliage upon them, made to\r\nrecline, at an angle of forty-five degrees, against a bank of clay,\r\nheaped up, without regular form, to the height of five or six feet.\r\nOthers, again, were mere holes dug in the earth perpendicularly, and\r\ncovered over with similar branches, these being removed when the tenant\r\nwas about to enter, and pulled on again when he had entered. A few were\r\nbuilt among the forked limbs of trees as they stood, the upper limbs\r\nbeing partially cut through, so as to bend over upon the lower, thus\r\nforming thicker shelter from the weather. The greater number, however,\r\nconsisted of small shallow caverns, apparently scratched in the face of\r\na precipitous ledge of dark stone, resembling fuller\'s earth, with\r\nwhich three sides of the village was bounded. At the door of each of\r\nthese primitive caverns was a small rock, which the tenant carefully\r\nplaced before the entrance upon leaving his residence, for what purpose\r\nI could not ascertain, as the stone itself was never of sufficient size\r\nto close up more than a third of the opening.\r\n\r\nThis village, if it were worthy of the name, lay in a valley of some\r\ndepth, and could only be approached from the southward, the precipitous\r\nledge of which I have already spoken cutting off all access in other\r\ndirections. Through the middle of the valley ran a brawling stream of\r\nthe same magical-looking water which has been described. We saw several\r\nstrange animals about the dwellings, all appearing to be thoroughly\r\ndomesticated. The largest of these creatures resembled our common hog\r\nin the structure of the body and snout; the tail, however, was bushy,\r\nand the legs slender as those of the antelope. Its motion was\r\nexceedingly awkward and indecisive, and we never saw it attempt to run.\r\nWe noticed also several animals very similar in appearance, but of a\r\ngreater length of body, and covered with a black wool. There were a\r\ngreat variety of tame fowls running about, and these seemed to\r\nconstitute the chief food of the natives. To our astonishment we saw\r\nblack albatross among these birds in a state of entire domestication,\r\ngoing to sea periodically for food, but always returning to the village\r\nas a home, and using the southern shore in the vicinity as a place of\r\nincubation. There they were joined by their friends the pelicans as\r\nusual, but these latter never followed them to the dwellings of the\r\nsavages. Among the other kinds of tame fowls were ducks, differing very\r\nlittle from the canvass-back of our own country, black gannets, and a\r\nlarge bird not unlike the buzzard in appearance, but not carnivorous.\r\nOf fish there seemed to be a great abundance. We saw, during our visit,\r\na quantity of dried salmon, rock cod, blue dolphins, mackerel,\r\nblackfish, skate, conger eels, elephant-fish, mullets, soles,\r\nparrotfish, leather-jackets, gurnards, hake, flounders, paracutas, and\r\ninnumerable other varieties. We noticed, too, that most of them were\r\nsimilar to the fish about the group of the Lord Auckland Islands, in a\r\nlatitude as low as fifty-one degrees south. The Gallipago tortoise was\r\nalso very plentiful. We saw but few wild animals, and none of a large\r\nsize, or of a species with which we were familiar. One or two serpents\r\nof a formidable aspect crossed our path, but the natives paid them\r\nlittle attention, and we concluded that they were not venomous.\r\n\r\nAs we approached the village with Too-wit and his party, a vast crowd\r\nof the people rushed out to meet us, with loud shouts, among which we\r\ncould only distinguish the everlasting _Anamoo-moo!_ and _Lama-Lama!_\r\nWe were much surprised at perceiving that, with one or two exceptions,\r\nthese new comers were entirely naked, the skins being used only by the\r\nmen of the canoes. All the weapons of the country seemed also to be in\r\nthe possession of the latter, for there was no appearance of any among\r\nthe villagers. There were a great many women and children, the former\r\nnot altogether wanting in what might be termed personal beauty. They\r\nwere straight, tall, and well formed, with a grace and freedom of\r\ncarriage not to be found in civilized society. Their lips, however,\r\nlike those of the men, were thick and clumsy, so that, even when\r\nlaughing, the teeth were never disclosed. Their hair was of a finer\r\ntexture than that of the males. Among these naked villagers there might\r\nhave been ten or twelve who were clothed, like the party of Too-wit, in\r\ndresses of black skin, and armed with lances and heavy clubs. These\r\nappeared to have great influence among the rest, and were always\r\naddressed by the title _Wampoo_. These, too, were the tenants of the\r\nblack skin palaces. That of Too-wit was situated in the centre of the\r\nvillage, and was much larger and somewhat better constructed than\r\nothers of its kind. The tree which formed its support was cut off at a\r\ndistance of twelve feet or thereabout from the root, and there were\r\nseveral branches left just below the cut, these serving to extend the\r\ncovering, and in this way prevent its flapping about the trunk. The\r\ncovering, too, which consisted of four very large skins fastened\r\ntogether with wooden skewers, was secured at the bottom with pegs\r\ndriven through it and into the ground. The floor was strewed with a\r\nquantity of dry leaves by way of carpet.\r\n\r\nTo this hut we were conducted with great solemnity, and as many of the\r\nnatives crowded in after us as possible. Too-wit seated himself on the\r\nleaves, and made signs that we should follow his example. This we did,\r\nand presently found ourselves in a situation peculiarly uncomfortable,\r\nif not indeed critical. We were on the ground, twelve in number, with\r\nthe savages, as many as forty, sitting on their hams so closely around\r\nus that, if any disturbance had arisen, we should have found it\r\nimpossible to make use of our arms, or indeed to have risen on our\r\nfeet. The pressure was not only inside the tent, but outside, where\r\nprobably was every individual on the whole island, the crowd being\r\nprevented from trampling us to death only by the incessant exertions\r\nand vociferations of Too-wit. Our chief security lay, however, in the\r\npresence of Too-wit himself among us, and we resolved to stick by him\r\nclosely, as the best chance of extricating ourselves from the dilemma,\r\nsacrificing him immediately upon the first appearance of hostile\r\ndesign.\r\n\r\nAfter some trouble a certain degree of quiet was restored, when the\r\nchief addressed us in a speech of great length, and very nearly\r\nresembling the one delivered in the canoes, with the exception that the\r\n_Anamoo-moos!_ were now somewhat more strenuously insisted upon than\r\nthe _Lama-Lamas!_ We listened in profound silence until the conclusion\r\nof his harangue, when Captain Guy replied by assuring the chief of his\r\neternal friendship and good-will, concluding what he had to say by a\r\npresent of several strings of blue beads and a knife. At the former the\r\nmonarch, much to our surprise, turned up his nose with some expression\r\nof contempt; but the knife gave him the most unlimited satisfaction,\r\nand he immediately ordered dinner. This was handed into the tent over\r\nthe heads of the attendants, and consisted of the palpitating entrails\r\nof a species of unknown animal, probably one of the slim-legged hogs\r\nwhich we had observed in our approach to the village. Seeing us at a\r\nloss how to proceed, he began, by way of setting us an example, to\r\ndevour yard after yard of the enticing food, until we could positively\r\nstand it no longer, and evinced such manifest symptoms of rebellion of\r\nstomach as inspired his majesty with a degree of astonishment only\r\ninferior to that brought about by the looking-glasses. We declined,\r\nhowever, partaking of the delicacies before us, and endeavoured to make\r\nhim understand that we had no appetite whatever, having just finished a\r\nhearty _d\xe9jeuner_.\r\n\r\nWhen the monarch had made an end of his meal, we commenced a series of\r\ncross-questioning in every ingenious manner we could devise, with a\r\nview of discovering what were the chief productions of the country, and\r\nwhether any of them might be turned to profit. At length he seemed to\r\nhave some idea of our meaning, and offered to accompany us to a part of\r\nthe coast where he assured us the _biche de mer_ (pointing to a\r\nspecimen of that animal) was to be found in great abundance. We were\r\nglad at this early opportunity of escaping from the oppression of the\r\ncrowd, and signified our eagerness to proceed. We now left the tent,\r\nand, accompanied by the whole population of the village, followed the\r\nchief to the southeastern extremity of the island, not far from the bay\r\nwhere our vessel lay at anchor. We waited here for about an hour, until\r\nthe four canoes were brought round by some of the savages to our\r\nstation. The whole of our party then getting into one of them, we were\r\npaddled along the edge of the reef before mentioned, and of another\r\nstill farther out, where we saw a far greater quantity of _biche de\r\nmer_ than the oldest seaman among us had ever seen in those groups of\r\nthe lower latitudes most celebrated for this article of commerce. We\r\nstayed near these reefs only long enough to satisfy ourselves that we\r\ncould easily load a dozen vessels with the animal if necessary, when we\r\nwere taken alongside the schooner, and parted with Too-wit after\r\nobtaining from him a promise that he would bring us, in the course of\r\ntwenty-four hours, as many of the canvass-back ducks and Gallipago\r\ntortoises as his canoes would hold. In the whole of this adventure we\r\nsaw nothing in the demeanour of the natives calculated to create\r\nsuspicion, with the single exception of the systematic manner in which\r\ntheir party was strengthened during our route from the schooner to the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief was as good as his word, and we were soon plentifully\r\nsupplied with fresh provision. We found the tortoises as fine as we had\r\never seen, and the ducks surpassed our best species of wild fowl, being\r\nexceedingly tender, juicy, and well-flavoured. Besides these, the\r\nsavages brought us, upon our making them comprehend our wishes, a vast\r\nquantity of brown celery and scurvy grass, with a canoe-load of fresh\r\nfish and some dried. The celery was a treat indeed, and the scurvy\r\ngrass proved of incalculable benefit in restoring those of our men who\r\nhad shown symptoms of disease. In a very short time we had not a single\r\nperson on the sick-list. We had also plenty of other kinds of fresh\r\nprovision, among which may be mentioned a species of shellfish\r\nresembling the muscle in shape, but with the taste of an oyster.\r\nShrimps, too, and prawns were abundant, and albatross and other birds\'\r\neggs with dark shells. We took in, too, a plentiful stock of the flesh\r\nof the hog which I have mentioned before. Most of the men found it a\r\npalatable food, but I thought it fishy and otherwise disagreeable. In\r\nreturn for these good things we presented the natives with blue beads,\r\nbrass trinkets, nails, knives, and pieces of red cloth, they being\r\nfully delighted in the exchange. We established a regular market on\r\nshore, just under the guns of the schooner, where our barterings were\r\ncarried on with every appearance of good faith, and a degree of order\r\nwhich their conduct at the village of _Klock-klock_ had not led us to\r\nexpect from the savages.\r\n\r\nMatters went on thus very amicably for several days, during which\r\nparties of the natives were frequently on board the schooner, and\r\nparties of our men frequently on shore, making long excursions into the\r\ninterior, and receiving no molestation whatever. Finding the ease with\r\nwhich the vessel might be loaded with _biche de mer_, owing to the\r\nfriendly disposition of the islanders, and the readiness with which\r\nthey would render us assistance in collecting it, Captain Guy resolved\r\nto enter into negotiation with Too-wit for the erection of suitable\r\nhouses in which to cure the article, and for the services of himself\r\nand tribe in gathering as much as possible, while he himself took\r\nadvantage of the fine weather to prosecute his voyage to the southward.\r\nUpon mentioning this project to the chief he seemed very willing to\r\nenter into an agreement. A bargain was accordingly struck, perfectly\r\nsatisfactory to both parties, by which it was arranged that, after\r\nmaking the necessary preparations, such as laying off the proper\r\ngrounds, erecting a portion of the buildings, and doing some other work\r\nin which the whole of our crew would be required, the schooner should\r\nproceed on her route, leaving three of her men on the island to\r\nsuperintend the fulfilment of the project, and instruct the natives in\r\ndrying the _biche de mer_. In regard to terms, these were made to\r\ndepend upon the exertions of the savages in our absence. They were to\r\nreceive a stipulated quantity of blue beads, knives, red cloth, and so\r\nforth, for every certain number of piculs of the _biche de mer_ which\r\nshould be ready on our return.\r\n\r\nA description of the nature of this important article of commerce, and\r\nthe method of preparing it, may prove of some interest to my readers,\r\nand I can find no more suitable place than this for introducing an\r\naccount of it. The following comprehensive notice of the substance is\r\ntaken from a modern history of a voyage to the South Seas.\r\n\r\n"It is that _mollusca_ from the Indian Seas which is known in commerce\r\nby the French name _bouche de mer_ (a nice morsel from the sea). If I\r\nam not much mistaken, the celebrated Cuvier calls it _gasteropeda\r\npulmonifera_. It is abundantly gathered in the coasts of the Pacific\r\nIslands, and gathered especially for the Chinese market, where it\r\ncommands a great price, perhaps as much as their much-talked of edible\r\nbird\'s nests, which are probably made up of the gelatinous matter\r\npicked up by a species of swallow from the body of these mollusc\xe6. They\r\nhave no shell, no legs, nor any prominent part, except an _absorbing_\r\nand an _excretory_, opposite organs; but, by their elastic wings, like\r\ncaterpillars or worms, they creep in shallow waters, in which, when\r\nlow, they can be seen by a kind of swallow, the sharp bill of which,\r\ninserted in the soft animal, draws a gummy and filamentous substance,\r\nwhich, by drying, can be wrought into the solid walls of their nest.\r\nHence the name of _gasteropeda pulmonifera_.\r\n\r\n"This mollusca is oblong, and of different sizes, from three to\r\neighteen inches in length; and I have seen a few that were not less\r\nthan two feet long. They are nearly round, a little flattish on one\r\nside, which lies next the bottom of the sea; and they are from one to\r\neight inches thick. They crawl up into shallow water at particular\r\nseasons of the year, probably for the purpose of gendering, as we often\r\nfind them in pairs. It is when the sun has the most power on the water,\r\nrendering it tepid, that they approach the shore; and they often go up\r\ninto places so shallow, that, on the tide\'s receding, they are left\r\ndry, exposed to the heat of the sun. But they do not bring forth their\r\nyoung in shallow water, as we never see any of their progeny, and the\r\nfull-grown ones are always observed coming in from deep water. They\r\nfeed principally on that class of zoophytes which produce the coral.\r\n\r\n"The _biche de mer_ is generally taken in three or four feet water;\r\nafter which they are brought on shore, and split at one end with a\r\nknife, the incision being one inch or more, according to the size of\r\nthe mollusca. Through this opening the entrails are forced out by\r\npressure, and they are much like those of any other small tenant of the\r\ndeep. The article is then washed, and afterward boiled to a certain\r\ndegree, which must not be too much or too little. They are then buried\r\nin the ground for four hours, then boiled again for a short time, after\r\nwhich they are dried, either by the fire or the sun. Those cured by the\r\nsun are worth the most; but where one picul (133-1/3 lbs.) can be cured\r\nthat way, I can cure thirty piculs by the fire. When once properly\r\ncured, they can be kept in a dry place for two or three years without\r\nany risk; but they should be examined once in every few months, say\r\nfour times a year, to see if any dampness is likely to affect them.\r\n\r\n"The Chinese, as before stated, consider _biche de mer_ a very great\r\nluxury, believing that it wonderfully strengthens and nourishes the\r\nsystem, and renews the exhausted system of the immoderate voluptuary.\r\nThe first quality commands a high price in Canton, being worth ninety\r\ndollars a picul; the second quality seventy-five dollars; the third\r\nfifty dollars; the fourth thirty dollars; the fifth twenty dollars; the\r\nsixth twelve dollars; the seventh eight dollars; and the eighth four\r\ndollars; small cargoes, however, will often bring more in Manilla,\r\nSingapore, and Batavia."\r\n\r\nAn agreement having been thus entered into, we proceeded immediately to\r\nland everything necessary for preparing the buildings and clearing the\r\nground. A large flat space near the eastern shore of the bay was\r\nselected, where there was plenty both of wood and water, and within a\r\nconvenient distance of the principal reefs on which the _biche de mer_\r\nwas to be procured. We now all set to work in good earnest, and soon,\r\nto the great astonishment of the savages, had felled a sufficient\r\nnumber of trees for our purpose, getting them quickly in order for the\r\nframework of the houses, which in two or three days were so far under\r\nway that we could safely trust the rest of the work to the three men\r\nwhom we intended to leave behind. These were John Carson, Alfred\r\nHarris, and ---- Peterson (all natives of London, I believe), who\r\nvolunteered their services in this respect.\r\n\r\nBy the last of the month we had everything in readiness for departure.\r\nWe had agreed, however, to pay a formal visit of leavestaking to the\r\nvillage, and Too-wit insisted so pertinaciously upon our keeping the\r\npromise, that we did not think it advisable to run the risk of\r\noffending him by a final refusal. I believe that not one of us had at\r\nthis time the slightest suspicion of the good faith of the savages.\r\nThey had uniformly behaved with the greatest decorum, aiding us with\r\nalacrity in our work, offering us their commodities frequently without\r\nprice, and never, in any instance, pilfering a single article, although\r\nthe high value they set upon the goods we had with us was evident by\r\nthe extravagant demonstrations of joy always manifested upon our making\r\nthem a present. The women especially were most obliging in every\r\nrespect, and, upon the whole, we should have been the most suspicious\r\nof human beings had we entertained a single thought of perfidy on the\r\npart of a people who treated us so well. A very short while sufficed to\r\nprove that this apparent kindness of disposition was only the result of\r\na deeply-laid plan for our destruction, and that the islanders for whom\r\nwe entertained such inordinate feelings of esteem were among the most\r\nbarbarous, subtle, and bloodthirsty wretches that ever contaminated the\r\nface of the globe.\r\n\r\nIt was on the first of February that we went on shore for the purpose\r\nof visiting the village. Although, as said before, we entertained not\r\nthe slightest suspicion, still no proper precaution was neglected. Six\r\nmen were left in the schooner with instructions to permit none of the\r\nsavages to approach the vessel during our absence, under any pretence\r\nwhatever, and to remain constantly on deck. The boarding-nettings were\r\nup, the guns double-shotted with grape and canister, and the swivels\r\nloaded with canisters of musket-balls. She lay, with her anchor apeak,\r\nabout a mile from the shore, and no canoe could approach her in any\r\ndirection without being distinctly seen and exposed to the full fire of\r\nour swivels immediately.\r\n\r\nThe six men being left on board, our shore-party consisted of\r\nthirty-two persons in all. We were armed to the teeth, having with us\r\nmuskets, pistols, and cutlasses, besides each a long kind of seaman\'s\r\nknife, somewhat resembling the Bowie knife now so much used throughout\r\nour western and southern country. A hundred of the black skin warriors\r\nmet us at the landing for the purpose of accompanying us on our way. We\r\nnoticed, however, with some surprise, that they were now entirely\r\nwithout arms; and, upon questioning Too-wit in relation to this\r\ncircumstance, he merely answered that _Mattee non we pa pa si_--meaning\r\nthat there was no need of arms where all were brothers. We took this in\r\ngood part, and proceeded.\r\n\r\nWe had passed the spring and rivulet of which I before spoke, and were\r\nnow entering upon a narrow gorge leading through the chain of soapstone\r\nhills among which the village was situated. This gorge was very rocky\r\nand uneven, so much so that it was with no little difficulty we\r\nscrambled through it on our first visit to Klock-klock. The whole\r\nlength of the ravine might have been a mile and a half, or probably two\r\nmiles. It wound in every possible direction through the hills (having\r\napparently formed, at some remote period, the bed of a torrent), in no\r\ninstance proceeding more than twenty yards without an abrupt turn. The\r\nsides of this dell would have averaged, I am sure, seventy or eighty\r\nfeet in perpendicular altitude throughout the whole of their extent,\r\nand in some portions they arose to an astonishing height, overshadowing\r\nthe pass so completely that but little of the light of day could\r\npenetrate. The general width was about forty feet, and occasionally it\r\ndiminished so as not to allow the passage of more than five or six\r\npersons abreast. In short, there could be no place in the world better\r\nadapted for the consummation of an ambuscade, and it was no more than\r\nnatural that we should look carefully to our arms as we entered upon\r\nit. When I now think of our egregious folly, the chief subject of\r\nastonishment seems to be, that we should have ever ventured, under any\r\ncircumstances, so completely into the power of unknown savages as to\r\npermit them to march both before and behind us in our progress through\r\nthis ravine. Yet such was the order we blindly took up, trusting\r\nfoolishly to the force of our party, the unarmed condition of Too-wit\r\nand his men, the certain efficacy of our fire-arms (whose effect was\r\nyet a secret to the natives), and, more than all, to the long-sustained\r\npretension of friendship kept up by these infamous wretches. Five or\r\nsix of them went on before, as if to lead the way, ostentatiously\r\nbusying themselves in removing the larger stones and rubbish from the\r\npath. Next came our own party. We walked closely together, taking care\r\nonly to prevent separation. Behind followed the main body of the\r\nsavages, observing unusual order and decorum.\r\n\r\nDirk Peters, a man named Wilson Allen, and myself were on the right of\r\nour companions, examining, as we went along, the singular\r\nstratification of the precipice which overhung us. A fissure in the\r\nsoft rock attracted our attention. It was about wide enough for one\r\nperson to enter without squeezing, and extended back into the hill some\r\neighteen or twenty feet in a straight course, sloping afterward to the\r\nleft. The height of the opening, as far as we could see into it from\r\nthe main gorge, was perhaps sixty or seventy feet. There were one or\r\ntwo stunted shrubs growing from the crevices, bearing a species of\r\nfilbert, which I felt some curiosity to examine, and pushed in briskly\r\nfor that purpose, gathering five or six of the nuts at a grasp, and\r\nthen hastily retreating. As I turned, I found that Peters and Allen had\r\nfollowed me. I desired them to go back, as there was not room for two\r\npersons to pass, saying they should have some of my nuts. They\r\naccordingly turned, and were scrambling back, Allen being close to the\r\nmouth of the fissure, when I was suddenly aware of a concussion\r\nresembling nothing I had ever before experienced, and which impressed\r\nme with a vague conception, if indeed I then thought of anything, that\r\nthe whole foundations of the solid globe were suddenly rent asunder,\r\nand that the day of universal dissolution was at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as I could collect my scattered senses, I found myself nearly\r\nsuffocated, and grovelling in utter darkness among a quantity of loose\r\nearth, which was also falling upon me heavily in every direction,\r\nthreatening to bury me entirely. Horribly alarmed at this idea, I\r\nstruggled to gain my feet, and at length succeeded. I then remained\r\nmotionless for some moments, endeavouring to conceive what had happened\r\nto me, and where I was. Presently I heard a deep groan just at my ear,\r\nand afterward the smothered voice of Peters calling to me for aid in\r\nthe name of God. I scrambled one or two paces forward, when I fell\r\ndirectly over the head and shoulders of my companion, who, I soon\r\ndiscovered, was buried in a loose mass of earth as far as his middle,\r\nand struggling desperately to free himself from the pressure. I tore\r\nthe dirt from around him with all the energy I could command, and at\r\nlength succeeded in getting him out.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we sufficiently recovered from our fright and surprise to be\r\ncapable of conversing rationally, we both came to the conclusion that\r\nthe walls of the fissure in which we had ventured had, by some\r\nconvulsion of nature, or probably from their own weight, caved in\r\noverhead, and that we were consequently lost for ever, being thus\r\nentombed alive. For a long time we gave up supinely to the most intense\r\nagony and despair, such as cannot be adequately imagined by those who\r\nhave never been in a similar situation. I firmly believe that no\r\nincident ever occurring in the course of human events is more adapted\r\nto inspire the supremeness of mental and bodily distress than a case\r\nlike our own, of living inhumation. The blackness of darkness which\r\nenvelops the victim, the terrific oppression of lungs, the stifling\r\nfumes from the damp earth, unite with the ghastly considerations that\r\nwe are beyond the remotest confines of hope, and that such is the\r\nallotted portion of _the dead_, to carry into the human heart a degree\r\nof appalling awe and horror not to be tolerated--never to be conceived.\r\n\r\nAt length Peters proposed that we should endeavour to ascertain\r\nprecisely the extent of our calamity, and grope about our prison; it\r\nbeing barely possible, he observed, that some opening might be yet left\r\nus for escape. I caught eagerly at this hope, and, arousing myself to\r\nexertion, attempted to force my way through the loose earth. Hardly had\r\nI advanced a single step before a glimmer of light became perceptible,\r\nenough to convince me that, at all events, we should not immediately\r\nperish for want of air. We now took some degree of heart, and\r\nencouraged each other to hope for the best. Having scrambled over a\r\nbank of rubbish which impeded our farther progress in the direction of\r\nthe light, we found less difficulty in advancing, and also experienced\r\nsome relief from the excessive oppression of lungs which had tormented\r\nus. Presently we were enabled to obtain a glimpse of the objects\r\naround, and discovered that we were near the extremity of the straight\r\nportion of the fissure, where it made a turn to the left. A few\r\nstruggles more, and we reached the bend, when, to our inexpressible\r\njoy, there appeared a long seam or crack extending upward a vast\r\ndistance, generally at an angle of about forty-five degrees, although\r\nsometimes much more precipitous. We could not see through the whole\r\nextent of this opening; but, as a good deal of light came down it, we\r\nhad little doubt of finding at the top of it (if we could by any means\r\nreach the top) a clear passage into the open air.\r\n\r\nI now called to mind that three of us had entered the fissure from the\r\nmain gorge, and that our companion, Allen, was still missing; we\r\ndetermined at once to retrace our steps and look for him. After a long\r\nsearch, and much danger from the farther caving in of the earth above\r\nus, Peters at length cried out to me that he had hold of our\r\ncompanion\'s foot, and that his whole body was deeply buried beneath the\r\nrubbish, beyond a possibility of extricating him. I soon found that\r\nwhat he said was too true, and that, of course, life had been long\r\nextinct. With sorrowful hearts, therefore, we left the corpse to its\r\nfate, and again made our way to the bend.\r\n\r\nThe breadth of the seam was barely sufficient to admit us, and, after\r\none or two ineffectual efforts at getting up, we began once more to\r\ndespair. I have before said that the chain of hills through which ran\r\nthe main gorge was composed of a species of soft rock resembling\r\nsoapstone. The sides of the cleft we were now attempting to ascend were\r\nof the same material, and so excessively slippery, being wet, that we\r\ncould get but little foothold upon them even in their least precipitous\r\nparts; in some places, where the ascent was nearly perpendicular, the\r\ndifficulty was, of course, much aggravated; and, indeed, for some time\r\nwe thought it insurmountable. We took courage, however, from despair;\r\nand what, by dint of cutting steps in the soft stone with our Bowie\r\nknives, and swinging, at the risk of our lives, to small projecting\r\npoints of a harder species of slaty rock which now and then protruded\r\nfrom the general mass, we at length reached a natural platform, from\r\nwhich was perceptible a patch of blue sky, at the extremity of a\r\nthickly-wooded ravine. Looking back now, with somewhat more leisure, at\r\nthe passage through which we had thus far proceeded, we clearly saw,\r\nfrom the appearance of its sides, that it was of late formation, and we\r\nconcluded that the concussion, whatever it was, which had so\r\nunexpectedly overwhelmed us, had also, at the same moment, laid open\r\nthis path for escape. Being quite exhausted with exertion, and, indeed,\r\nso weak that we were scarcely able to stand or articulate, Peters now\r\nproposed that we should endeavour to bring our companions to the rescue\r\nby firing the pistols which still remained in our girdles--the muskets\r\nas well as cutlasses had been lost among the loose earth at the bottom\r\nof the chasm. Subsequent events proved that, had we fired, we should\r\nhave sorely repented it; but, luckily, a half suspicion of foul play\r\nhad by this time arisen in my mind, and we forbore to let the savages\r\nknow of our whereabouts.\r\n\r\nAfter having reposed for about an hour, we pushed on slowly up the\r\nravine, and had gone no great way before we heard a succession of\r\ntremendous yells. At length we reached what might be called the surface\r\nof the ground; for our path hitherto, since leaving the platform, had\r\nlain beneath an archway of high rock and foliage, at a vast distance\r\noverhead. With great caution we stole to a narrow opening, through\r\nwhich we had a clear sight of the surrounding country, when the whole\r\ndreadful secret of the concussion broke upon us in one moment and at\r\none view.\r\n\r\nThe spot from which we looked was not far from the summit of the\r\nhighest peak in the range of the soapstone hills. The gorge in which\r\nour party of thirty-two had entered ran within fifty feet to the left\r\nof us. But, for at least one hundred yards, the channel or bed of this\r\ngorge was entirely filled up with the chaotic ruins of more than a\r\nmillion tons of earth and stone that had been artificially tumbled\r\nwithin it. The means by which the vast mass had been precipitated were\r\nnot more simple than evident, for sure traces of the murderous work\r\nwere yet remaining. In several spots along the top of the eastern side\r\nof the gorge (we were now on the western) might be seen stakes of wood\r\ndriven into the earth. In these spots the earth had not given way; but\r\nthroughout the whole extent of the face of the precipice from which the\r\nmass _had_ fallen, it was clear, from marks left in the soil resembling\r\nthose made by the drill of the rock-blaster, that stakes similar to\r\nthose we saw standing had been inserted, at not more than a yard apart,\r\nfor the length of perhaps three hundred feet, and ranging at about ten\r\nfeet back from the edge of the gulf. Strong cords of grape vine were\r\nattached to the stakes still remaining on the hill, and it was evident\r\nthat such cords had also been attached to each of the other stakes. I\r\nhave already spoken of the singular stratification of these soapstone\r\nhills; and the description just given of the narrow and deep fissure\r\nthrough which we effected our escape from inhumation will afford a\r\nfurther conception of its nature. This was such that almost every\r\nnatural convulsion would be sure to split the soil into perpendicular\r\nlayers or ridges running parallel with one another; and a very moderate\r\nexertion of art would be sufficient for effecting the same purpose. Of\r\nthis stratification the savages had availed themselves to accomplish\r\ntheir treacherous ends. There can be no doubt that, by the continuous\r\nline of stakes, a partial rupture of the soil had been brought about,\r\nprobably to the depth of one or two feet, when, by means of a savage\r\npulling at the end of each of the cords (these cords being attached to\r\nthe tops of the stakes, and extending back from the edge of the cliff),\r\na vast leverage power was obtained, capable of hurling the whole face\r\nof the hill, upon a given signal, into the bosom of the abyss below.\r\nThe fate of our poor companions was no longer a matter of uncertainty.\r\nWe alone had escaped from the tempest of that overwhelming destruction.\r\nWe were the only living white men upon the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur situation, as it now appeared, was scarcely less dreadful than when\r\nwe had conceived ourselves entombed for ever. We saw before us no\r\nprospect but that of being put to death by the savages, or of dragging\r\nout a miserable existence in captivity among them. We might, to be\r\nsure, conceal ourselves for a time from their observation among the\r\nfastnesses of the hills, and, as a final resort, in the chasm from\r\nwhich we had just issued; but we must either perish in the long Polar\r\nwinter through cold and famine, or be ultimately discovered in our\r\nefforts to obtain relief.\r\n\r\nThe whole country around us seemed to be swarming with savages, crowds\r\nof whom, we now perceived, had come over from the islands to the\r\nsouthward on flat rafts, doubtless with a view of lending their aid in\r\nthe capture and plunder of the Jane. The vessel still lay calmly at\r\nanchor in the bay, those on board being apparently quite unconscious of\r\nany danger awaiting them. How we longed at that moment to be with them!\r\neither to aid in effecting their escape, or to perish with them in\r\nattempting a defence. We saw no chance even of warning them of their\r\ndanger without bringing immediate destruction upon our own heads, with\r\nbut a remote hope of benefit to them. A pistol fired might suffice to\r\napprize them that something wrong had occurred; but the report could\r\nnot possibly inform them that their only prospect of safety lay in\r\ngetting out of the harbour forthwith--it could not tell them that no\r\nprinciples of honour now bound them to remain, that their companions\r\nwere no longer among the living. Upon hearing the discharge they could\r\nnot be more thoroughly prepared to meet the foe, who were now getting\r\nready to attack, than they already were, and always had been. No good,\r\ntherefore, and infinite harm, would result from our firing, and, after\r\nmature deliberation, we forbore.\r\n\r\nOur next thought was to attempt a rush towards the vessel, to seize one\r\nof the four canoes which lay at the head of the bay, and endeavour to\r\nforce a passage on board. But the utter impossibility of succeeding in\r\nthis desperate task soon became evident. The country, as I said before,\r\nwas literally swarming with the natives, skulking among the bushes and\r\nrecesses of the hills, so as not to be observed from the schooner. In\r\nour immediate vicinity especially, and blockading the sole path by\r\nwhich we could hope to attain the shore in the proper point, were\r\nstationed the whole party of the black skin warriors, with Too-wit at\r\ntheir head, and apparently only waiting for some re-enforcement to\r\ncommence his onset upon the Jane. The canoes, too, which lay at the\r\nhead of the bay were manned with savages, unarmed, it is true, but who\r\nundoubtedly had arms within reach. We were forced, therefore, however\r\nunwillingly, to remain in our place of concealment, mere spectators of\r\nthe conflict which presently ensued.\r\n\r\nIn about half an hour we saw some sixty or seventy rafts, or flatboats,\r\nwith outriggers, filled with savages, and coming round the southern\r\nbight of the harbour. They appeared to have no arms except short clubs,\r\nand stones which lay in the bottom of the rafts. Immediately afterward\r\nanother detachment, still larger, approached in an opposite direction,\r\nand with similar weapons. The four canoes, too, were now quickly filled\r\nwith natives, starting up from the bushes at the head of the bay, and\r\nput off swiftly to join the other parties. Thus, in less time than I\r\nhave taken to tell it, and as if by magic, the Jane saw herself\r\nsurrounded by an immense multitude of desperadoes evidently bent upon\r\ncapturing her at all hazards.\r\n\r\nThat they would succeed in so doing could not be doubted for an\r\ninstant. The six men left in the vessel, however resolutely they might\r\nengage in her defence, were altogether unequal to the proper management\r\nof the guns, or in any manner to sustain a contest at such odds. I\r\ncould hardly imagine that they would make resistance at all, but in\r\nthis was deceived; for presently I saw them get springs upon the cable,\r\nand bring the vessel\'s starboard broadside to bear upon the canoes,\r\nwhich by this time were within pistol range, the rafts being nearly a\r\nquarter of a mile to windward. Owing to some cause unknown, but most\r\nprobably to the agitation of our poor friends at seeing themselves in\r\nso hopeless a situation, the discharge was an entire failure. Not a\r\ncanoe was hit or a single savage injured, the shots striking short and\r\n_ricoch\xeating_ over their heads. The only effect produced upon them was\r\nastonishment at the unexpected report and smoke, which was so excessive\r\nthat for some moments I almost thought they would abandon their design\r\nentirely, and return to the shore. And this they would most likely have\r\ndone had our men followed up their broadside by a discharge of small\r\narms, in which, as the canoes were now so near at hand, they could not\r\nhave failed in doing some execution, sufficient, at least, to deter\r\nthis party from a farther advance, until they could have given the\r\nrafts also a broadside. But, in place of this, they left the canoe\r\nparty to recover from their panic, and, by looking about them, to see\r\nthat no injury had been sustained, while they flew to the larboard to\r\nget ready for the rafts.\r\n\r\nThe discharge to larboard produced the most terrible effect. The star\r\nand double-headed shot of the large guns cut seven or eight of the\r\nrafts completely asunder, and killed, perhaps, thirty or forty of the\r\nsavages outright, while a hundred of them, at least, were thrown into\r\nthe water, the most of them dreadfully wounded. The remainder,\r\nfrightened out of their senses, commenced at once a precipitate\r\nretreat, not even waiting to pick up their maimed companions, who were\r\nswimming about in every direction, screaming and yelling for aid. This\r\ngreat success, however, came too late for the salvation of our devoted\r\npeople. The canoe party were already on board the schooner to the\r\nnumber of more than a hundred and fifty, the most of them having\r\nsucceeded in scrambling up the chains and over the boarding nettings\r\neven before the matches had been applied to the larboard guns. Nothing\r\ncould now withstand their brute rage. Our men were borne down at once,\r\noverwhelmed, trodden under foot, and absolutely torn to pieces in an\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nSeeing this, the savages on the rafts got the better of their fears,\r\nand came up in shoals to the plunder. In five minutes the Jane was a\r\npitiable scene indeed of havoc and tumultuous outrage. The decks were\r\nsplit open and ripped up; the cordage, sails, and everything moveable\r\non deck demolished as if by magic; while, by dint of pushing at the\r\nstern, towing with the canoes, and hauling at the sides, as they swam\r\nin thousands around the vessel, the wretches finally forced her on\r\nshore (the cable having been slipped), and delivered her over to the\r\ngood offices of Too-wit, who, during the whole of the engagement, had\r\nmaintained, like a skilful general, his post of security and\r\nreconnoissance among the hills, but, now that the victory was completed\r\nto his satisfaction, condescended to scamper down with his warriors of\r\nthe black skin, and become a partaker in the spoils.\r\n\r\nToo-wit\'s descent left us at liberty to quit our hiding-place and\r\nreconnoitre the hill in the vicinity of the chasm. At about fifty yards\r\nfrom the mouth of it we saw a small spring of water, at which we slaked\r\nthe burning thirst that now consumed us. Not far from the spring we\r\ndiscovered several of the filbert-bushes which I mentioned before. Upon\r\ntasting the nuts we found them palatable, and very nearly resembling in\r\nflavour the common English filbert. We collected our hats full\r\nimmediately, deposited them within the ravine, and returned for more.\r\nWhile we were busily employed in gathering these, a rustling in the\r\nbushes alarmed us, and we were upon the point of stealing back to our\r\ncovert, when a large black bird of the bittern species strugglingly and\r\nslowly arose above the shrubs. I was so much startled that I could do\r\nnothing, but Peters had sufficient presence of mind to run up to it\r\nbefore it could make its escape, and seize it by the neck. Its\r\nstruggles and screams were tremendous, and we had thoughts of letting\r\nit go, lest the noise should alarm some of the savages who might be\r\nstill lurking in the neighbourhood. A stab with a Bowie knife, however,\r\nat length brought it to the ground, and we dragged it into the ravine,\r\ncongratulating ourselves that, at all events, we had thus obtained a\r\nsupply of food enough to last us for a week.\r\n\r\nWe now went out again to look about us, and ventured a considerable\r\ndistance down the southern declivity of the hill, but met with nothing\r\nelse which could serve us for food. We therefore collected a quantity\r\nof dry wood and returned, seeing one or two large parties of the\r\nnatives on their way to the village, laden with the plunder of the\r\nvessel, and who, we were apprehensive, might discover us in passing\r\nbeneath the hill.\r\n\r\nOur next care was to render our place of concealment as secure as\r\npossible, and, with this object, we arranged some brushwood over the\r\naperture which I have before spoken of as the one through which we saw\r\nthe patch of blue sky, on reaching the platform from the interior of\r\nthe chasm. We left only a very small opening, just wide enough to admit\r\nof our seeing the bay, without the risk of being discovered from below.\r\nHaving done this, we congratulated ourselves upon the security of the\r\nposition; for we were now completely excluded from observation, as long\r\nas we chose to remain within the ravine itself, and not venture out\r\nupon the hill. We could perceive no traces of the savages having ever\r\nbeen within this hollow; but, indeed, when we came to reflect upon the\r\nprobability that the fissure through which we attained it had been only\r\njust now created by the fall of the cliff opposite, and that no other\r\nway of attaining it could be perceived, we were not so much rejoiced at\r\nthe thought of being secure from molestation as fearful lest there\r\nshould be absolutely no means left us for descent. We resolved to\r\nexplore the summit of the hill thoroughly, when a good opportunity\r\nshould offer. In the mean time we watched the motions of the savages\r\nthrough our loophole.\r\n\r\nThey had already made a complete wreck of the vessel, and were now\r\npreparing to set her on fire. In a little while we saw the smoke\r\nascending in huge volumes from her main-hatchway, and, shortly\r\nafterward, a dense mass of flame burst up from the forecastle. The\r\nrigging, masts, and what remained of the sails caught immediately, and\r\nthe fire spread rapidly along the decks. Still a great many of the\r\nsavages retained their stations about her, hammering with large stones,\r\naxes, and cannon balls at the bolts and other copper and iron work. On\r\nthe beach, and in canoes and rafts, there were not less, altogether, in\r\nthe immediate vicinity of the schooner, than ten thousand natives,\r\nbesides the shoals of them who, laden with booty, were making their way\r\ninland and over to the neighbouring islands. We now anticipated a\r\ncatastrophe, and were not disappointed. First of all there came a smart\r\nshock (which we felt distinctly where we were as if we had been\r\nslightly galvanized), but unattended with any visible signs of an\r\nexplosion. The savages were evidently startled, and paused for an\r\ninstant from their labours and yellings. They were upon the point of\r\nrecommencing, when suddenly a mass of smoke puffed up from the decks,\r\nresembling a black and heavy thunder-cloud--then, as if from its\r\nbowels, arose a tall stream of vivid fire to the height, apparently, of\r\na quarter of a mile--then there came a sudden circular expansion of the\r\nflame--then the whole atmosphere was magically crowded, in a single\r\ninstant, with a wild chaos of wood, and metal, and human limbs--and,\r\nlastly, came the concussion in its fullest fury, which hurled us\r\nimpetuously from our feet, while the hills echoed and re-echoed the\r\ntumult, and a dense shower of the minutest fragments of the ruins\r\ntumbled headlong in every direction around us.\r\n\r\nThe havoc among the savages far exceeded our utmost expectation, and\r\nthey had now, indeed, reaped the full and perfect fruits of their\r\ntreachery. Perhaps a thousand perished by the explosion, while at least\r\nan equal number were desperately mangled. The whole surface of the bay\r\nwas literally strewn with the struggling and drowning wretches, and on\r\nshore matters were even worse. They seemed utterly appalled by the\r\nsuddenness and completeness of their discomfiture, and made no efforts\r\nat assisting one another. At length we observed a total change in their\r\ndemeanour. From absolute stupor they appeared to be, all at once,\r\naroused to the highest pitch of excitement, and rushed wildly about,\r\ngoing to and from a certain point on the beach, with the strangest\r\nexpressions of mingled horror, rage, and intense curiosity depicted on\r\ntheir countenances, and shouting, at the top of their voices,\r\n_Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!_\r\n\r\nPresently we saw a large body go off into the hills, whence they\r\nreturned in a short time, carrying stakes of wood. These they brought\r\nto the station where the crowd was the thickest, which now separated so\r\nas to afford us a view of the object of all this excitement. We\r\nperceived something white lying on the ground, but could not\r\nimmediately make out what it was. At length we saw that it was the\r\ncarcass of the strange animal with the scarlet teeth and claws which\r\nthe schooner had picked up at sea on the eighteenth of January. Captain\r\nGuy had had the body preserved for the purpose of stuffing the skin and\r\ntaking it to England. I remember he had given some directions about it\r\njust before our making the island, and it had been brought into the\r\ncabin and stowed away in one of the lockers. It had now been thrown on\r\nshore by the explosion; but why it had occasioned so much concern among\r\nthe savages was more than we could comprehend. Although they crowded\r\naround the carcass at a little distance, none of them seemed willing to\r\napproach it closely. By-and-by the men with the stakes drove them in a\r\ncircle around it, and, no sooner was this arrangement completed, than\r\nthe whole of the vast assembly rushed into the interior of the island,\r\nwith loud screams of _Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the six or seven days immediately following we remained in our\r\nhiding-place upon the hill, going out only occasionally, and then with\r\nthe greatest precaution, for water and filberts. We had made a kind of\r\npent-house on the platform, furnishing it with a bed of dry leaves, and\r\nplacing in it three large flat stones, which served us for both\r\nfireplace and table. We kindled a fire without difficulty by rubbing\r\ntwo pieces of dry wood together, the one soft, the other hard. The bird\r\nwe had taken in such good season proved excellent eating, although\r\nsomewhat tough. It was not an oceanic fowl, but a species of bittern,\r\nwith jet black and grizzly plumage, and diminutive wings in proportion\r\nto its bulk. We afterward saw three of the same kind in the vicinity of\r\nthe ravine, apparently seeking for the one we had captured; but, as\r\nthey never alighted, we had no opportunity of catching them.\r\n\r\nAs long as this fowl lasted we suffered nothing from our situation; but\r\nit was now entirely consumed, and it became absolutely necessary that\r\nwe should look out for provision. The filberts would not satisfy the\r\ncravings of hunger, afflicting us, too, with severe gripings of the\r\nbowels, and, if freely indulged in, with violent headache. We had seen\r\nseveral large tortoises near the seashore to the eastward of the hill,\r\nand perceived they might be easily taken, if we could get at them\r\nwithout the observation of the natives. It was resolved, therefore, to\r\nmake an attempt at descending.\r\n\r\nWe commenced by going down the southern declivity, which seemed to\r\noffer the fewest difficulties, but had not proceeded a hundred yards\r\nbefore (as we had anticipated from appearances on the hill-top) our\r\nprogress was entirely arrested by a branch of the gorge in which our\r\ncompanions had perished. We now passed along the edge of this for about\r\na quarter of a mile, when we were again stopped by a precipice of\r\nimmense depth, and, not being able to make our way along the brink of\r\nit, we were forced to retrace our steps by the main ravine.\r\n\r\nWe now pushed over to the eastward, but with precisely similar fortune.\r\nAfter an hour\'s scramble, at the risk of breaking our necks, we\r\ndiscovered that we had merely descended into a vast pit of black\r\ngranite, with fine dust at the bottom, and whence the only egress was\r\nby the rugged path in which we had come down. Toiling again up this\r\npath, we now tried the northern edge of the hill. Here we were obliged\r\nto use the greatest possible caution in our manoeuvres, as the least\r\nindiscretion would expose us to the full view of the savages in the\r\nvillage. We crawled along, therefore, on our hands and knees, and,\r\noccasionally, were even forced to throw ourselves at full length,\r\ndragging our bodies along by means of the shrubbery. In this careful\r\nmanner we had proceeded but a little way, when we arrived at a chasm\r\nfar deeper than any we had yet seen, and leading directly into the main\r\ngorge. Thus our fears were fully confirmed, and we found ourselves cut\r\noff entirely from access to the world below. Thoroughly exhausted by\r\nour exertions, we made the best of our way back to the platform, and,\r\nthrowing ourselves upon the bed of leaves, slept sweetly and soundly\r\nfor some hours.\r\n\r\nFor several days after this fruitless search we were occupied in\r\nexploring every part of the summit of the hill, in order to inform\r\nourselves of its actual resources. We found that it would afford us no\r\nfood, with the exception of the unwholesome filberts, and a rank\r\nspecies of scurvy grass which grew in a little patch of not more than\r\nfour rods square, and would be soon exhausted. On the fifteenth of\r\nFebruary, as near as I can remember, there was not a blade of this\r\nleft, and the nuts were growing scarce; our situation, therefore, could\r\nhardly be more lamentable.[5] On the sixteenth we again went round the\r\nwalls of our prison, in hope of finding some avenue of escape, but to\r\nno purpose. We also descended the chasm in which we had been\r\noverwhelmed, with the faint expectation of discovering, through this\r\nchannel, some opening to the main ravine. Here, too, we were\r\ndisappointed, although we found and brought up with us a musket.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: This day was rendered remarkable by our observing in the\r\nsouth several huge wreaths of the grayish vapour I have before spoken\r\nof.]\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth we set out with the determination of examining more\r\nthoroughly the chasm of black granite into which we had made our way in\r\nthe first search. We remembered that one of the fissures in the sides\r\nof this pit had been but partially looked into, and we were anxious to\r\nexplore it, although with no expectation of discovering here any\r\nopening.\r\n\r\nWe found no great difficulty in reaching the bottom of the hollow as\r\nbefore, and were now sufficiently calm to survey it with some\r\nattention. It was, indeed, one of the most singular-looking places\r\nimaginable, and we could scarcely bring ourselves to believe it\r\naltogether the work of nature. The pit, from its eastern to its western\r\nextremity, was about five hundred yards in length, when all its\r\nwindings were threaded; the distance from east to west in a straight\r\nline not being more (I should suppose, having no means of accurate\r\nexamination) than forty or fifty yards. Upon first descending into the\r\nchasm, that is to say, for a hundred feet downward from the summit of\r\nthe hill, the sides of the abyss bore little resemblance to each other,\r\nand, apparently, had at no time been connected, the one surface being\r\nof the soapstone and the other of marl, granulated with some metallic\r\nmatter. The average breadth, or interval between the two cliffs, was\r\nprobably here sixty feet, but there seemed to be no regularity of\r\nformation. Passing down, however, beyond the limit spoken of, the\r\ninterval rapidly contracted, and the sides began to run parallel,\r\nalthough, for some distance farther, they were still dissimilar in\r\ntheir material and form of surface. Upon arriving within fifty feet of\r\nthe bottom, a perfect regularity commenced. The sides were now entirely\r\nuniform in substance, in colour, and in lateral direction, the material\r\nbeing a very black and shining granite, and the distance between the\r\ntwo sides, at all points facing each other, exactly twenty yards. The\r\nprecise formation of the chasm will be best understood by means of a\r\ndelineation taken upon the spot; for I had luckily with me a pocketbook\r\nand pencil, which I preserved with great care through a long series of\r\nsubsequent adventure, and to which I am indebted for memoranda of many\r\nsubjects which would otherwise have been crowded from my remembrance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 1_.]\r\n\r\nThis figure (see figure 1) gives the general outlines of the chasm,\r\nwithout the minor cavities in the sides, of which there were several,\r\neach cavity having a corresponding protuberance opposite. The bottom of\r\nthe gulf was covered to the depth of three or four inches with a powder\r\nalmost impalpable, beneath which we found a continuation of the black\r\ngranite. To the right, at the lower extremity, will be noticed the\r\nappearance of a small opening; this is the fissure alluded to above,\r\nand to examine which more minutely than before was the object of our\r\nsecond visit. We now pushed into it with vigour, cutting away a\r\nquantity of brambles which impeded us, and removing a vast heap of\r\nsharp flints somewhat resembling arrowheads in shape. We were\r\nencouraged to persevere, however, by perceiving some little light\r\nproceeding from the farther end. We at length squeezed our way for\r\nabout thirty feet, and found that the aperture was a low and\r\nregularly-formed arch, having a bottom of the same impalpable powder as\r\nthat in the main chasm. A strong light now broke upon us, and, turning\r\na short bend, we found ourselves in another lofty chamber, similar to\r\nthe one we had left in every respect but longitudinal form. Its general\r\nfigure is here given. (See figure 2.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 2_.]\r\n\r\nThe total length of this chasm, commencing at the opening _a_ and\r\nproceeding round the curve _b_ to the extremity _d_, is five hundred\r\nand fifty yards. At _c_ we discovered a small aperture similar to the\r\none through which we had issued from the other chasm, and this was\r\nchoked up in the same manner with brambles and a quantity of the white\r\narrowhead flints. We forced our way through it, finding it about forty\r\nfeet long, and emerged into a third chasm. This, too, was precisely\r\nlike the first, except in its longitudinal shape, which was thus. (See\r\nfigure 3.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 3_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 5_.]\r\n\r\nWe found the entire length of the third chasm three hundred and twenty\r\nyards. At the point _a_ was an opening about six feet wide, and\r\nextending fifteen feet into the rock, where it terminated in a bed of\r\nmarl, there being no other chasm beyond, as we had expected. We were\r\nabout leaving this fissure, into which very little light was admitted,\r\nwhen Peters called my attention to a range of singular-looking\r\nindentures in the surface of the marl forming the termination of the\r\n_cul-de-sac_. With a very slight exertion of the imagination, the left,\r\nor most northerly of these indentures might have been taken for the\r\nintentional, although rude, representation of a human figure standing\r\nerect, with outstretched arm. The rest of them bore also some little\r\nresemblance to alphabetical characters, and Peters was willing, at all\r\nevents, to adopt the idle opinion that they were really such. I\r\nconvinced him of his error, finally, by directing his attention to the\r\nfloor of the fissure, where, among the powder, we picked up, piece by\r\npiece, several large flakes of the marl, which had evidently been\r\nbroken off by some convulsion from the surface where the indentures\r\nwere found, and which had projecting points exactly fitting the\r\nindentures; thus proving them to have been the work of nature. Figure\r\n4. presents an accurate copy of the whole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 4_.]\r\n\r\nAfter satisfying ourselves that these singular caverns afforded us no\r\nmeans of escape from our prison, we made our way back, dejected and\r\ndispirited, to the summit of the hill. Nothing worth mentioning\r\noccurred during the next twenty-four hours, except that, in examining\r\nthe ground to the eastward of the third chasm, we found two triangular\r\nholes of great depth, and also with black granite sides. Into these\r\nholes we did not think it worth while to attempt descending, as they\r\nhad the appearance of mere natural wells, without outlet. They were\r\neach about twenty yards in circumference, and their shape, as well as\r\nrelative position in regard to the third chasm, is shown in figure 5,\r\npreceding page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the twentieth of the month, finding it altogether impossible to\r\nsubsist any longer upon the filberts, the use of which occasioned us\r\nthe most excruciating torment, we resolved to make a desperate attempt\r\nat descending the southern declivity of the hill. The face of the\r\nprecipice was here of the softest species of soapstone, although nearly\r\nperpendicular throughout its whole extent (a depth of a hundred and\r\nfifty feet at the least), and in many places even overarching. After\r\nlong search we discovered a narrow ledge about twenty feet below the\r\nbrink of the gulf; upon this Peters contrived to leap, with what\r\nassistance I could render him by means of our pocket-handkerchiefs tied\r\ntogether. With somewhat more difficulty I also got down; and we then\r\nsaw the possibility of descending the whole way by the process in which\r\nwe had clambered up from the chasm when we had been buried by the fall\r\nof the hill--that is, by cutting steps in the face of the soapstone\r\nwith our knives. The extreme hazard of the attempt can scarcely be\r\nconceived; but, as there was no other resource, we determined to\r\nundertake it.\r\n\r\nUpon the ledge where we stood there grew some filbert-bushes; and to\r\none of these we made fast an end of our rope of handkerchiefs. The\r\nother end being tied round Peters\'s waist, I lowered him down over the\r\nedge of the precipice until the handkerchiefs were stretched tight. He\r\nnow proceeded to dig a deep hole in the soapstone (as far in as eight\r\nor ten inches), sloping away the rock above to the height of a foot, or\r\nthereabout, so as to allow of his driving, with the butt of a pistol, a\r\ntolerably strong peg into the levelled surface. I then drew him up for\r\nabout four feet, when he made a hole similar to the one below, driving\r\nin a peg as before, and having thus a resting-place for both feet and\r\nhands. I now unfastened the handkerchiefs from the bush, throwing him\r\nthe end, which he tied to the peg in the uppermost hole, letting\r\nhimself down gently to a station about three feet lower than he had yet\r\nbeen, that is, to the full extent of the handkerchiefs. Here he dug\r\nanother hole, and drove another peg. He then drew himself up, so as to\r\nrest his feet in the hole just cut, taking hold with his hands upon the\r\npeg in the one above. It was now necessary to untie the handkerchiefs\r\nfrom the topmost peg, with the view of fastening them to the second;\r\nand here he found that an error had been committed in cutting the holes\r\nat so great a distance apart. However, after one or two unsuccessful\r\nand dangerous attempts at reaching the knot (having to hold on with his\r\nleft hand while he laboured to undo the fastening with his right), he\r\nat length cut the string, leaving six inches of it affixed to the peg.\r\nTying the handkerchiefs now to the second peg, he descended to a\r\nstation below the third, taking care not to go too far down. By these\r\nmeans (means which I should never have conceived of myself, and for\r\nwhich we were indebted altogether to Peters\'s ingenuity and resolution)\r\nmy companion finally succeeded, with the occasional aid of projections\r\nin the cliff, in reaching the bottom without accident.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before I could summon sufficient resolution to follow\r\nhim; but I did at length attempt it. Peters had taken off his shirt\r\nbefore descending, and this, with my own, formed the rope necessary for\r\nthe adventure. After throwing down the musket found in the chasm, I\r\nfastened this rope to the bushes, and let myself down rapidly,\r\nstriving, by the vigour of my movements, to banish the trepidation\r\nwhich I could overcome in no other manner. This answered sufficiently\r\nwell for the first four or five steps; but presently I found my\r\nimagination growing terribly excited by thoughts of the vast depth yet\r\nto be descended, and the precarious nature of the pegs and soapstone\r\nholes which were my only support. It was in vain I endeavoured to\r\nbanish these reflections, and to keep my eyes steadily bent upon the\r\nflat surface of the cliff before me. The more earnestly I struggled\r\n_not to think_, the more intensely vivid became my conceptions, and the\r\nmore horribly distinct. At length arrived that crisis of fancy, so\r\nfearful in all similar cases, the crisis in which we begin to\r\nanticipate the feelings with which we _shall_ fall--to picture to\r\nourselves the sickness, and dizziness, and the last struggle, and the\r\nhalf swoon, and the final bitterness of the rushing and headlong\r\ndescent. And now I found these fancies creating their own realities,\r\nand all imagined horrors crowding upon me in fact. I felt my knees\r\nstrike violently together, while my fingers were gradually yet\r\ncertainly relaxing their grasp. There was a ringing in my ears, and I\r\nsaid, "This is my knell of death!" And now I was consumed with the\r\nirrepressible desire of looking below. I could not, I would not,\r\nconfine my glances to the cliff; and, with a wild, indefinable emotion\r\nhalf of horror, half of a relieved oppression, I threw my vision far\r\ndown into the abyss. For one moment my fingers clutched convulsively\r\nupon their hold, while, with the movement, the faintest possible idea\r\nof ultimate escape wandered, like a shadow, through my mind--in the\r\nnext my whole soul was pervaded with _a longing to fall_; a desire, a\r\nyearning, a passion utterly uncontrollable. I let go at once my grasp\r\nupon the peg, and, turning half round from the precipice, remained\r\ntottering for an instant against its naked face. But now there came a\r\nspinning of the brain; a shrill-sounding and phantom voice screamed\r\nwithin my ears; a dusky, fiendish, and filmy figure stood immediately\r\nbeneath me; and, sighing, I sunk down with a bursting heart, and\r\nplunged within its arms.\r\n\r\nI had swooned, and Peters had caught me as I fell. He had observed my\r\nproceedings from his station at the bottom of the cliff; and,\r\nperceiving my imminent danger, had endeavoured to inspire me with\r\ncourage by every suggestion he could devise; although my confusion of\r\nmind had been so great as to prevent my hearing what he said, or being\r\nconscious that he had even spoken to me at all. At length, seeing me\r\ntotter, he hastened to ascend to my rescue, and arrived just in time\r\nfor my preservation. Had I fallen with my full weight, the rope of\r\nlinen would inevitably have snapped, and I should have been\r\nprecipitated into the abyss; as it was, he contrived to let me down\r\ngently, so as to remain suspended without danger until animation\r\nreturned. This was in about fifteen minutes. On recovery, my\r\ntrepidation had entirely vanished; I felt a new being, and, with some\r\nlittle further aid from my companion, reached the bottom also in\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nWe now found ourselves not far from the ravine which had proved the\r\ntomb of our friends, and to the southward of the spot where the hill\r\nhad fallen. The place was one of singular wildness, and its aspect\r\nbrought to my mind the descriptions given by travellers of those dreary\r\nregions marking the site of degraded Babylon. Not to speak of the ruins\r\nof the disruptured cliff, which formed a chaotic barrier in the vista\r\nto the northward, the surface of the ground in every other direction\r\nwas strewn with huge tumuli, apparently the wreck of some gigantic\r\nstructures of art; although, in detail, no semblance of art could be\r\ndetected. Scoria were abundant, and large shapeless blocks of the black\r\ngranite, intermingled with others of marl,[6] and both granulated with\r\nmetal. Of vegetation there were no traces whatsoever throughout the\r\nwhole of the desolate area within sight. Several immense scorpions were\r\nseen, and various reptiles not elsewhere to be found in the high\r\nlatitudes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The marl was also black; indeed, we noticed no\r\nlight-coloured substances of any kind upon the island.]\r\n\r\nAs food was our most immediate object, we resolved to make our way to\r\nthe seacoast, distant not more than half a mile, with a view of\r\ncatching turtle, several of which we had observed from our place of\r\nconcealment on the hill. We had proceeded some hundred yards, threading\r\nour route cautiously between the huge rocks and tumuli, when, upon\r\nturning a corner, five savages sprung upon us from a small cavern,\r\nfelling Peters to the ground with a blow from a club. As he fell the\r\nwhole party rushed upon him to secure their victim, leaving me time to\r\nrecover from my astonishment. I still had the musket, but the barrel\r\nhad received so much injury in being thrown from the precipice that I\r\ncast it aside as useless, preferring to trust my pistols, which had\r\nbeen carefully preserved in order. With these I advanced upon the\r\nassailants, firing one after the other in quick succession. Two savages\r\nfell, and one, who was in the act of thrusting a spear into Peters,\r\nsprung to his feet without accomplishing his purpose. My companion\r\nbeing thus released, we had no further difficulty. He had his pistols\r\nalso, but prudently declined using them, confiding in his great\r\npersonal strength, which far exceeded that of any person I have ever\r\nknown. Seizing a club from one of the savages who had fallen, he dashed\r\nout the brains of the three who remained, killing each instantaneously\r\nwith a single blow of the weapon, and leaving us completely masters of\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nSo rapidly had these events passed, that we could scarcely believe in\r\ntheir reality, and were standing over the bodies of the dead in a\r\nspecies of stupid contemplation, when we were brought to recollection\r\nby the sound of shouts in the distance. It was clear that the savages\r\nhad been alarmed by the firing, and that we had little chance of\r\navoiding discovery. To regain the cliff, it would be necessary to\r\nproceed in the direction of the shouts; and even should we succeed in\r\narriving at its base, we should never be able to ascend it without\r\nbeing seen. Our situation was one of the greatest peril, and we were\r\nhesitating in which path to commence a flight, when one of the savages\r\nwhom I had shot, and supposed dead, sprang briskly to his feet, and\r\nattempted to make his escape. We overtook him, however, before he had\r\nadvanced many paces, and were about to put him to death, when Peters\r\nsuggested that we might derive some benefit from forcing him to\r\naccompany us in our attempt at escape. We therefore dragged him with\r\nus, making him understand that we would shoot him if he offered\r\nresistance. In a few minutes he was perfectly submissive, and ran by\r\nour sides as we pushed in among the rocks, making for the seashore.\r\n\r\nSo far, the irregularities of the ground we had been traversing hid the\r\nsea, except at intervals, from our sight, and, when we first had it\r\nfairly in view, it was, perhaps, two hundred yards distant. As we\r\nemerged into the open beach we saw, to our great dismay, an immense\r\ncrowd of the natives pouring from the village, and from all visible\r\nquarters of the island, making towards us with gesticulations of\r\nextreme fury, and howling like wild beasts. We were upon the point of\r\nturning upon our steps, and trying to secure a retreat among the\r\nfastnesses of the rougher ground, when I discovered the bows of two\r\ncanoes projecting from behind a large rock which ran out into the\r\nwater. Towards these we now ran with all speed, and, reaching them,\r\nfound them unguarded, and without any other freight than three of the\r\nlarge Gallipago turtles and the usual supply of paddles for sixty\r\nrowers. We instantly took possession of one of them, and, forcing our\r\ncaptive on board, pushed out to sea with all the strength we could\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nWe had not made, however, more than fifty yards from the shore before\r\nwe became sufficiently calm to perceive the great oversight of which we\r\nhad been guilty in leaving the other canoe in the power of the savages,\r\nwho, by this time, were not more than twice as far from the beach as\r\nourselves, and were rapidly advancing to the pursuit. No time was now\r\nto be lost. Our hope was, at best, a forlorn one, but we had none\r\nother. It was very doubtful whether, with the utmost exertion, we could\r\nget back in time to anticipate them in taking possession of the canoe;\r\nbut yet there was a chance that we could. We might save ourselves if we\r\nsucceeded, while not to make the attempt was to resign ourselves to\r\ninevitable butchery.\r\n\r\nThe canoe was modelled with the bow and stern alike, and, in place of\r\nturning it round, we merely changed our position in paddling. As soon\r\nas the savages perceived this they redoubled their yells, as well as\r\ntheir speed, and approached with inconceivable rapidity. We pulled,\r\nhowever, with all the energy of desperation, and arrived at the\r\ncontested point before more than one of the natives had attained it.\r\nThis man paid dearly for his superior agility, Peters shooting him\r\nthrough the head with a pistol as he approached the shore. The foremost\r\namong the rest of his party were probably some twenty or thirty paces\r\ndistant as we seized upon the canoe. We at first endeavoured to pull\r\nher into the deep water, beyond the reach of the savages, but, finding\r\nher too firmly aground, and there being no time to spare, Peters, with\r\none or two heavy strokes from the butt of the musket, succeeded in\r\ndashing out a large portion of the bow and of one side. We then pushed\r\noff. Two of the natives by this time had got hold of our boat,\r\nobstinately refusing to let go, until we were forced to despatch them\r\nwith our knives. We were now clear off, and making great way out to\r\nsea. The main body of the savages, upon reaching the broken canoe, set\r\nup the most tremendous yell of rage and disappointment conceivable. In\r\ntruth, from everything I could see of these wretches, they appeared to\r\nbe the most wicked, hypocritical, vindictive, bloodthirsty, and\r\naltogether fiendish race of men upon the face of the globe. It is clear\r\nwe should have had no mercy had we fallen into their hands. They made a\r\nmad attempt at following us in the fractured canoe, but, finding it\r\nuseless, again vented their rage in a series of hideous vociferations,\r\nand rushed up into the hills.\r\n\r\nWe were thus relieved from immediate danger, but our situation was\r\nstill sufficiently gloomy. We knew that four canoes of the kind we had\r\nwere at one time in the possession of the savages, and were not aware\r\nof the fact (afterward ascertained from our captive) that two of these\r\nhad been blown to pieces in the explosion of the Jane Guy. We\r\ncalculated, therefore, upon being yet pursued, as soon as our enemies\r\ncould get round to the bay (distant about three miles) where the boats\r\nwere usually laid up. Fearing this, we made every exertion to leave the\r\nisland behind us, and went rapidly through the water, forcing the\r\nprisoner to take a paddle. In about half an hour, when we had gained,\r\nprobably, five or six miles to the southward, a large fleet of the\r\nflat-bottomed canoes or rafts was seen to emerge from the bay,\r\nevidently with the design of pursuit. Presently they put back,\r\ndespairing to overtake us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now found ourselves in the wide and desolate Antarctic Ocean, in a\r\nlatitude exceeding eighty-four degrees, in a frail canoe, and with no\r\nprovision but the three turtles. The long Polar winter, too, could not\r\nbe considered as far distant, and it became necessary that we should\r\ndeliberate well upon the course to be pursued. There were six or seven\r\nislands in sight belonging to the same group, and distant from each\r\nother about five or six leagues; but upon neither of these had we any\r\nintention to venture. In coming from the northward in the Jane Guy we\r\nhad been gradually leaving behind us the severest regions of ice--this,\r\nhowever little it may be in accordance with the generally-received\r\nnotions respecting the Antarctic, was a fact experience would not\r\npermit us to deny. To attempt, therefore, getting back, would be\r\nfolly--especially at so late a period of the season. Only one course\r\nseemed to be left open for hope. We resolved to steer boldly to the\r\nsouthward, where there was at least a probability of discovering other\r\nlands, and more than a probability of finding a still milder climate.\r\n\r\nSo far we had found the Antarctic, like the Arctic Ocean, peculiarly\r\nfree from violent storms or immoderately rough water; but our canoe\r\nwas, at best, of frail structure, although large, and we set busily to\r\nwork with a view of rendering her as safe as the limited means in our\r\npossession would admit. The body of the boat was of no better material\r\nthan bark--the bark of a tree unknown. The ribs were of a tough osier,\r\nwell adapted to the purpose for which it was used. We had fifty feet\r\nroom from stem to stern, from four to six in breadth, and in depth\r\nthroughout four feet and a half--the boats thus differing vastly in\r\nshape from those of any other inhabitants of the Southern Ocean with\r\nwhom civilized nations are acquainted. We never did believe them the\r\nworkmanship of the ignorant islanders who owned them; and some days\r\nafter this period discovered, by questioning our captive, that they\r\nwere in fact made by the natives of a group to the southwest of the\r\ncountry where we found them, having fallen accidentally into the hands\r\nof our barbarians. What we could do for the security of our boat was\r\nvery little indeed. Several wide rents were discovered near both ends,\r\nand these we contrived to patch up with pieces of woollen jacket. With\r\nthe help of the superfluous paddles, of which there were a great many,\r\nwe erected a kind of framework about the bow, so as to break the force\r\nof any seas which might threaten to fill us in that quarter. We also\r\nset up two paddle-blades for masts, placing them opposite each other,\r\none by each gunwale, thus saving the necessity of a yard. To these\r\nmasts we attached a sail made of our shirts--doing this with some\r\ndifficulty, as here we could get no assistance from our prisoner\r\nwhatever, although he had been willing enough to labour in all the\r\nother operations. The sight of the linen seemed to affect him in a very\r\nsingular manner. He could not be prevailed upon to touch it or go near\r\nit, shuddering when we attempted to force him, and shrieking out\r\n_Tekeli-li!_\r\n\r\nHaving completed our arrangements in regard to the security of the\r\ncanoe, we now set sail to the south southeast for the present, with the\r\nview of weathering the most southerly of the group in sight. This being\r\ndone, we turned the bow full to the southward. The weather could by no\r\nmeans be considered disagreeable. We had a prevailing and very gentle\r\nwind from the northward, a smooth sea, and continual daylight. No ice\r\nwhatever was to be seen; _nor did I ever see one particle of this after\r\nleaving the parallel of Bennet\'s Islet_. Indeed, the temperature of the\r\nwater was here far too warm for its existence in any quantity. Having\r\nkilled the largest of our tortoises, and obtained from him not only\r\nfood, but a copious supply of water, we continued on our course,\r\nwithout any incident of moment, for perhaps seven or eight days, during\r\nwhich period we must have proceeded a vast distance to the southward,\r\nas the wind blew constantly with us, and a very strong current set\r\ncontinually in the direction we were pursuing.\r\n\r\n_March 1._[7] Many unusual phenomena now indicated that we were\r\nentering upon a region of novelty and wonder. A high range of light\r\ngray vapour appeared constantly in the southern horizon, flaring up\r\noccasionally in lofty streaks, now darting from east to west, now from\r\nwest to east, and again presenting a level and uniform summit--in\r\nshort, having all the wild variations of the Aurora Borealis. The\r\naverage height of this vapour, as apparent from our station, was about\r\ntwenty-five degrees. The temperature of the sea seemed to be increasing\r\nmomentarily, and there was a very perceptible alteration in its colour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: For obvious reasons I cannot pretend to strict accuracy in\r\nthese dates. They are given principally with a view to perspicuity of\r\nnarration, and as set down in my pencil memoranda.]\r\n\r\n_March 2._ To-day, by repeated questioning of our captive, we came to\r\nthe knowledge of many particulars in regard to the island of the\r\nmassacre, its inhabitants, and customs--but with these how can I _now_\r\ndetain the reader? I may say, however, that we learned there were eight\r\nislands in the group--that they were governed by a common king, named\r\n_Tsalemon_ or _Psalemoun_, who resided in one of the smallest of the\r\nislands--that the black skins forming the dress of the warriors came\r\nfrom an animal of huge size to be found only in a valley near the court\r\nof the king--that the inhabitants of the group fabricated no other\r\nboats than the flat-bottomed rafts; the four canoes being all of the\r\nkind in their possession, and these having been obtained, by mere\r\naccident, from some large island to the southwest--that his own name\r\nwas Nu-Nu--that he had no knowledge of Bennet\'s Islet--and that the\r\nappellation of the island we had left was _Tsalal_. The commencement of\r\nthe words _Tsalemon_ and _Tsalal_ was given with a prolonged hissing\r\nsound, which we found it impossible to imitate, even after repeated\r\nendeavours, and which was precisely the same with the note of the black\r\nbittern we had eaten upon the summit of the hill.\r\n\r\n_March 3._ The heat of the water was now truly remarkable, and its\r\ncolour was undergoing a rapid change, being no longer transparent, but\r\nof a milky consistency and hue. In our immediate vicinity it was\r\nusually smooth, never so rough as to endanger the canoe--but we were\r\nfrequently surprised at perceiving, to our right and left, at different\r\ndistances, sudden and extensive agitations of the surface--these, we at\r\nlength noticed, were always preceded by wild flickerings in the region\r\nof vapour to the southward.\r\n\r\n_March 4._ To-day, with the view of widening our sail, the breeze from\r\nthe northward dying away perceptibly, I took from my coat-pocket a\r\nwhite handkerchief. Nu-Nu was seated at my elbow, and the linen\r\naccidentally flaring in his face, he became violently affected with\r\nconvulsions. These were succeeded by drowsiness and stupor, and low\r\nmurmurings of Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!\r\n\r\n_March 5._ The wind had entirely ceased, but it was evident that we\r\nwere still hurrying on to the southward, under the influence of a\r\npowerful current. And now, indeed, it would seem reasonable that we\r\nshould experience some alarm at the turn events were taking--but we\r\nfelt none. The countenance of Peters indicated nothing of this nature,\r\nalthough it wore at times an expression I could not fathom. The Polar\r\nwinter appeared to be coming on--but coming without its terrors. I felt\r\na _numbness_ of body and mind--a dreaminess of sensation--but this was\r\nall.\r\n\r\n_March 6._ The gray vapour had now arisen many more degrees above the\r\nhorizon, and was gradually losing its grayness of tint. The heat of the\r\nwater was extreme, even unpleasant to the touch, and its milky hue was\r\nmore evident than ever. To-day a violent agitation of the water\r\noccurred very close to the canoe. It was attended, as usual, with a\r\nwild flaring up of the vapour at its summit, and a momentary division\r\nat its base. A fine white powder, resembling ashes--but certainly not\r\nsuch--fell over the canoe and over a large surface of the water, as the\r\nflickering died away among the vapour and the commotion subsided in the\r\nsea. Nu-Nu now threw himself on his face in the bottom of the boat, and\r\nno persuasions could induce him to arise.\r\n\r\n_March 7._ This day we questioned Nu-Nu concerning the motives of his\r\ncountrymen in destroying our companions; but he appeared to be too\r\nutterly overcome by terror to afford us any rational reply. He still\r\nobstinately lay in the bottom of the boat; and, upon our reiterating\r\nthe questions as to the motive, made use only of idiotic\r\ngesticulations, such as raising with his forefinger the upper lip, and\r\ndisplaying the teeth which lay beneath it. These were black. We had\r\nnever before seen the teeth of an inhabitant of Tsalal.\r\n\r\n_March 8._ To-day there floated by us one of the white animals whose\r\nappearance upon the beach at Tsalal had occasioned so wild a commotion\r\namong the savages. I would have picked it up, but there came over me a\r\nsudden listlessness, and I forbore. The heat of the water still\r\nincreased, and the hand could no longer be endured within it. Peters\r\nspoke little, and I knew not what to think of his apathy. Nu-Nu\r\nbreathed, and no more.\r\n\r\n_March 9._ The white ashy material fell now continually around us, and\r\nin vast quantities. The range of vapour to the southward had arisen\r\nprodigiously in the horizon, and began to assume more distinctness of\r\nform. I can liken it to nothing but a limitless cataract, rolling\r\nsilently into the sea from some immense and far-distant rampart in the\r\nheaven. The gigantic curtain ranged along the whole extent of the\r\nsouthern horizon. It emitted no sound.\r\n\r\n_March 21._ A sullen darkness now hovered above us--but from out the\r\nmilky depths of the ocean a luminous glare arose, and stole up along\r\nthe bulwarks of the boat. We were nearly overwhelmed by the white ashy\r\nshower which settled upon us and upon the canoe, but melted into the\r\nwater as it fell. The summit of the cataract was utterly lost in the\r\ndimness and the distance. Yet we were evidently approaching it with a\r\nhideous velocity. At intervals there were visible in it wide, yawning,\r\nbut momentary rents, and from out these rents, within which was a chaos\r\nof flitting and indistinct images, there came rushing and mighty, but\r\nsoundless winds, tearing up the enkindled ocean in their course.\r\n\r\n_March 22._ The darkness had materially increased, relieved only by the\r\nglare of the water thrown back from the white curtain before us. Many\r\ngigantic and pallidly white birds flew continuously now from beyond the\r\nveil, and their scream was the eternal _Tekeli-li!_ as they retreated\r\nfrom our vision. Hereupon Nu-Nu stirred in the bottom of the boat; but,\r\nupon touching him, we found his spirit departed. And now we rushed into\r\nthe embraces of the cataract, where a chasm threw itself open to\r\nreceive us. But there arose in our pathway a shrouded human figure,\r\nvery far larger in its proportions than any dweller among men. And the\r\nhue of the skin of the figure was of the perfect whiteness of the snow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe circumstances connected with the late sudden and distressing death\r\nof Mr. Pym are already well known to the public through the medium of\r\nthe daily press. It is feared that the few remaining chapters which\r\nwere to have completed his narrative, and which were retained by him,\r\nwhile the above were in type, for the purpose of revision, have been\r\nirrecoverably lost through the accident by which he perished himself.\r\nThis, however, may prove not to be the case, and the papers, if\r\nultimately found, will be given to the public.\r\n\r\nNo means have been left untried to remedy the deficiency. The gentleman\r\nwhose name is mentioned in the preface, and who, from the statement\r\nthere made, might be supposed able to fill the vacuum, has declined the\r\ntask--this for satisfactory reasons connected with the general\r\ninaccuracy of the details afforded him, and his disbelief in the entire\r\ntruth of the latter portions of the narration. Peters, from whom some\r\ninformation might be expected, is still alive, and a resident of\r\nIllinois, but cannot be met with at present. He may hereafter be found,\r\nand will, no doubt, afford material for a conclusion of Mr. Pym\'s\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the two or three final chapters (for there were but two or\r\nthree) is the more deeply to be regretted, as, it cannot be doubted,\r\nthey contained matter relative to the Pole itself, or at least to\r\nregions in its very near proximity; and as, too, the statements of the\r\nauthor in relation to these regions may shortly be verified or\r\ncontradicted by means of the governmental expedition now preparing for\r\nthe Southern Ocean.\r\n\r\nOn one point in the Narrative some remarks may be well offered; and it\r\nwould afford the writer of this appendix much pleasure if what he may\r\nhere observe should have a tendency to throw credit, in any degree,\r\nupon the very singular pages now published. We allude to the chasms\r\nfound in the island of Tsalal, and to the whole of the figures in the\r\nlatter portion of Chapter XXIII.\r\n\r\nMr. Pym has given the figures of the chasms without comment, and speaks\r\ndecidedly of the _indentures_ found at the extremity of the most\r\neasterly of these chasms as having but a fanciful resemblance to\r\nalphabetical characters, and, in short, as being positively _not such_.\r\nThis assertion is made in a manner so simple, and sustained by a\r\nspecies of demonstration so conclusive (viz., the fitting of the\r\nprojections of the fragments found among the dust into the indentures\r\nupon the wall), that we are forced to believe the writer in earnest;\r\nand no reasonable reader should suppose otherwise. But as the facts in\r\nrelation to _all_ the figures are most singular (especially when taken\r\nin connexion with statements made in the body of the narrative), it may\r\nbe as well to say a word or two concerning them all--this, too, the\r\nmore especially as the facts in question have, beyond doubt, escaped\r\nthe attention of Mr. Poe.\r\n\r\nFigure 1, then, figure 2, figure 3, and figure 5, when conjoined with\r\none another in the precise order which the chasms themselves presented,\r\nand when deprived of the small lateral branches or arches (which, it\r\nwill be remembered, served only as means of communication between the\r\nmain chambers, and were of totally distinct character), constitute an\r\nEthiopian verbal root--the root [Illustration] "To be shady"--whence\r\nall the inflections of shadow or darkness.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the "left or most northwardly" of the indentures in figure\r\n4, it is more than probable that the opinion of Peters was correct, and\r\nthat the hieroglyphical appearance was really the work of art, and\r\nintended as the representation of a human form. The delineation is\r\nbefore the reader, and he may, or may not, perceive the resemblance\r\nsuggested; but the rest of the indentures afford strong confirmation of\r\nPeters\'s idea. The upper range is evidently the Arabic verbal root\r\n[Illustration] "To be white," whence all the inflections of brilliancy\r\nand whiteness. The lower range is not so immediately perspicuous. The\r\ncharacters are somewhat broken and disjointed; nevertheless, it cannot\r\nbe doubted that, in their perfect state, they formed the full Egyptian\r\nword [Illustration] "The region of the south." It should be observed\r\nthat these interpretations confirm the opinion of Peters in regard to\r\nthe "most northwardly" of the figures. The arm is outstretched towards\r\nthe south.\r\n\r\nConclusions such as these open a wide field for speculation and\r\nexciting conjecture. They should be regarded, perhaps, in connexion\r\nwith some of the most faintly-detailed incidents of the narrative;\r\nalthough in no visible manner is this chain of connexion complete.\r\nTekeli-li! was the cry of the affrighted natives of Tsalal upon\r\ndiscovering the carcass of the _white_ animal picked up at sea. This\r\nalso was the shuddering exclamation of the captive Tsalalian upon\r\nencountering the _white_ materials in possession of Mr. Pym. This also\r\nwas the shriek of the swift-flying, _white_, and gigantic birds which\r\nissued from the vapoury _white_ curtain of the South. Nothing _white_\r\nwas to be found at Tsalal, and nothing otherwise in the subsequent\r\nvoyage to the region beyond. It is not impossible that "Tsalal," the\r\nappellation of the island of the chasms, may be found, upon minute\r\nphilological scrutiny, to betray either some alliance with the chasms\r\nthemselves, or some reference to the Ethiopian characters so\r\nmysteriously written in their windings.\r\n\r\n_"I have graven it within the hills, and my vengeance upon the dust\r\nwithin the rock."_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Note: The last two chapters, Chapters XXIV and XXV were\r\nnamed, respectively, XXIII and XXIV in the original publication, with,\r\ntherefore, two chapters XXIII.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
