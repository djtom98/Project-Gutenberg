But, sick at\r\nheart, depressed in mind and in body, exhausted by hunger and fatigue,\r\nto have been compelled to pocket any little pride I might have left,\r\nand solicit, as the penniless, homeless tramp which indeed I was, a\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x99s lodging in the casual ward,--and to solicit it in vain!--that\r\nwas worse. Much worse. About as bad as bad could be.\r\n\r\nI stared, stupidly, at the door which had just been banged in my face.\r\nI could scarcely believe that the thing was possible. I had hardly\r\nexpected to figure as a tramp; but, supposing it conceivable that I\r\ncould become a tramp, that I should be refused admission to that abode\r\nof all ignominy, the tramp\xe2\x80\x99s ward, was to have attained a depth of\r\nmisery of which never even in nightmares I had dreamed.\r\n\r\nAs I stood wondering what I should do, a man slouched towards me out\r\nof the shadow of the wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99e let yer in?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He says it\xe2\x80\x99s full.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Says it\xe2\x80\x99s full, does \xe2\x80\x99e? That\xe2\x80\x99s the lay at Fulham,--they always says\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s full. They wants to keep the number down.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI looked at the man askance. His head hung forward; his hands were in\r\nhis trouser pockets; his clothes were rags; his tone was husky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you mean that they say it\xe2\x80\x99s full when it isn\xe2\x80\x99t,--that they won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet me in although there\xe2\x80\x99s room?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s it,--bloke\xe2\x80\x99s a-kiddin\xe2\x80\x99 yer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, if there\xe2\x80\x99s room, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they bound to let me in?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Course they are,--and, blimey, if I was you I\xe2\x80\x99d make \xe2\x80\x99em. Blimey I\r\nwould!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe broke into a volley of execrations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But what am I to do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, give \xe2\x80\x99em another rouser--let \xe2\x80\x99em know as you won\xe2\x80\x99t be kidded!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI hesitated; then, acting on his suggestion, for the second time I rang\r\nthe bell. The door was flung wide open, and the grizzled pauper, who\r\nhad previously responded to my summons, stood in the open doorway. Had\r\nhe been the Chairman of the Board of Guardians himself he could not\r\nhave addressed me with greater scorn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What, here again! What\xe2\x80\x99s your little game? Think I\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing better\r\nto do than to wait upon the likes of you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I want to be admitted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you won\xe2\x80\x99t be admitted!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I want to see someone in authority.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ain\xe2\x80\x99t yer seein\xe2\x80\x99 someone in authority?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I want to see someone besides you,--I want to see the master.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you won\xe2\x80\x99t see the master!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe moved the door swiftly to; but, prepared for such a manoeuvre, I\r\nthrust my foot sufficiently inside to prevent his shutting it. I\r\ncontinued to address him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you sure that the ward is full?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Full two hours ago!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But what am I to do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re to do!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which is the next nearest workhouse?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Kensington.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSuddenly opening the door, as he answered me, putting out his arm he\r\nthrust me backwards. Before I could recover the door was closed. The\r\nman in rags had continued a grim spectator of the scene. Now he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nice bloke, ain\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s only one of the paupers,--has he any right to act as one of the\r\nofficials?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I tell yer some of them paupers is wuss than the orficers,--a long\r\nsight wuss! They thinks they owns the \xe2\x80\x99ouses, blimey they do. Oh it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na----fine world, this is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe paused. I hesitated. For some time there had been a suspicion of\r\nrain in the air. Now it was commencing to fall in a fine but soaking\r\ndrizzle. It only needed that to fill my cup to overflowing. My\r\ncompanion was regarding me with a sort of sullen curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ain\xe2\x80\x99t you got no money?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a farthing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Done much of this sort of thing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s the first time I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to a casual ward,--and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem\r\nas if I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get in now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought you looked as if you was a bit fresh.--What are yer goin\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\ndo?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How far is it to Kensington?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Work\xe2\x80\x99us?--about three mile;--but, if I was you, I\xe2\x80\x99d try St George\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the Fulham Road. Kensington\xe2\x80\x99s only a small place, they do you well\r\nthere, and it\xe2\x80\x99s always full as soon as the door\xe2\x80\x99s opened;--you\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99ave\r\nmore chawnce at St George\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was silent. I turned his words over in my mind, feeling as little\r\ndisposed to try the one place as the other. Presently he began again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve travelled from Reading this----day, I \xe2\x80\x99ave,--tramped\r\nevery----foot!--and all the way as I come along, I\xe2\x80\x99ll \xe2\x80\x99ave a shakedown\r\nat \xe2\x80\x99Ammersmith, I says,--and now I\xe2\x80\x99m as fur off from it as ever! This\r\nis a----fine country, this is,--I wish every----soul in it was swept\r\ninto the----sea, blimey I do! But I ain\xe2\x80\x99t goin\xe2\x80\x99 to go no further,--I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ave a bed in \xe2\x80\x99Ammersmith or I\xe2\x80\x99ll know the reason why.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How are you going to manage it,--have you got any money?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Got any money?--My crikey!--I look as though I \xe2\x80\x99ad,--I sound as though\r\nI \xe2\x80\x99ad too! I ain\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99ad no brads, \xe2\x80\x99cept now and then a brown, this larst\r\nsix months.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How are you going to get a bed then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Ow am I going to?--why, like this way.\xe2\x80\x99 He picked up two stones, one\r\nin either hand. The one in his left he flung at the glass which was\r\nover the door of the casual ward. It crashed through it, and through\r\nthe lamp beyond. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99ow I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to get a bed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe door was hastily opened. The grizzled pauper reappeared. He\r\nshouted, as he peered at us in the darkness,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who done that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I done it, guvnor,--and, if you like, you can see me do the other. It\r\nmight do your eyesight good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBefore the grizzled pauper could interfere, he had hurled the stone in\r\nhis right hand through another pane. I felt that it was time for me to\r\ngo. He was earning a night\xe2\x80\x99s rest at a price which, even in my\r\nextremity, I was not disposed to pay.\r\n\r\nWhen I left two or three other persons had appeared upon the scene, and\r\nthe man in rags was addressing them with a degree of frankness, which,\r\nin that direction, left little to be desired. I slunk away unnoticed.\r\nBut had not gone far before I had almost decided that I might as well\r\nhave thrown in my fortune with the bolder wretch, and smashed a window\r\ntoo. Indeed, more than once my feet faltered, as I all but returned to\r\ndo the feat which I had left undone.\r\n\r\nA more miserable night for an out-of-door excursion I could hardly have\r\nchosen. The rain was like a mist, and was not only drenching me to the\r\nskin, but it was rendering it difficult to see more than a little\r\ndistance in any direction. The neighbourhood was badly lighted. It was\r\none in which I was a stranger. I had come to Hammersmith as a last\r\nresource. It had seemed to me that I had tried to find some occupation\r\nwhich would enable me to keep body and soul together in every other\r\npart of London, and that now only Hammersmith was left. And, at\r\nHammersmith, even the workhouse would have none of me!\r\n\r\nRetreating from the inhospitable portal of the casual ward, I had taken\r\nthe first turning to the left,--and, at the moment, had been glad to\r\ntake it. In the darkness and the rain, the locality which I was\r\nentering appeared unfinished. I seemed to be leaving civilisation\r\nbehind me. The path was unpaved; the road rough and uneven, as if it\r\nhad never been properly made. Houses were few and far between. Those\r\nwhich I did encounter, seemed, in the imperfect light, amid the general\r\ndesolation, to be cottages which were crumbling to decay.\r\n\r\nExactly where I was I could not tell. I had a faint notion that, if I\r\nonly kept on long enough, I should strike some part of Walham Green.\r\nHow long I should have to keep on I could only guess. Not a creature\r\nseemed to be about of whom I could make inquiries. It was as if I was\r\nin a land of desolation.\r\n\r\nI suppose it was between eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock and midnight. I had not given\r\nup my quest for work till all the shops were closed,--and in\r\nHammersmith, that night, at any rate, they were not early closers. Then\r\nI had lounged about dispiritedly, wondering what was the next thing I\r\ncould do. It was only because I feared that if I attempted to spend the\r\nnight in the open air, without food, when the morning came I should be\r\nbroken up, and fit for nothing, that I sought a night\xe2\x80\x99s free board and\r\nlodging. It was really hunger which drove me to the workhouse door.\r\nThat was Wednesday. Since the Sunday night preceding nothing had passed\r\nmy lips save water from the public fountains,--with the exception of a\r\ncrust of bread which a man had given me whom I had found crouching at\r\nthe root of a tree in Holland Park. For three days I had been\r\nfasting,--practically all the time upon my feet. It seemed to me that\r\nif I had to go hungry till the morning I should collapse--there would\r\nbe an end. Yet, in that strange and inhospitable place, where was I to\r\nget food at that time of night, and how?\r\n\r\nI do not know how far I went. Every yard I covered, my feet dragged\r\nmore. I was dead beat, inside and out. I had neither strength nor\r\ncourage left. And within there was that frightful craving, which was as\r\nthough it shrieked aloud. I leant against some palings, dazed and\r\ngiddy. If only death had come upon me quickly, painlessly, how true a\r\nfriend I should have thought it! It was the agony of dying inch by inch\r\nwhich was so hard to bear.\r\n\r\nIt was some minutes before I could collect myself sufficiently to\r\nwithdraw from the support of the railings, and to start afresh. I\r\nstumbled blindly over the uneven road. Once, like a drunken man, I\r\nlurched forward, and fell upon my knees. Such was my backboneless state\r\nthat for some seconds I remained where I was, half disposed to let\r\nthings slide, accept the good the gods had sent me, and make a night of\r\nit just there. A long night, I fancy, it would have been, stretching\r\nfrom time unto eternity.\r\n\r\nHaving regained my feet, I had gone perhaps another couple of hundred\r\nyards along the road--Heaven knows that it seemed to me just then a\r\ncouple of miles!--when there came over me again that overpowering\r\ngiddiness which, I take it, was born of my agony of hunger. I\r\nstaggered, helplessly, against a low wall which, just there, was at the\r\nside of the path. Without it I should have fallen in a heap. The attack\r\nappeared to last for hours; I suppose it was only seconds; and, when I\r\ncame to myself, it was as though I had been aroused from a swoon of\r\nsleep,--aroused, to an extremity of pain. I exclaimed aloud,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For a loaf of bread what wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I do!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI looked about me, in a kind of frenzy. As I did so I for the first\r\ntime became conscious that behind me was a house. It was not a large\r\none. It was one of those so-called villas which are springing up in\r\nmultitudes all round London, and which are let at rentals of from\r\ntwenty-five to forty pounds a year. It was detached. So far as I could\r\nsee, in the imperfect light, there was not another building within\r\ntwenty or thirty yards of either side of it. It was in two storeys.\r\nThere were three windows in the upper storey. Behind each the blinds\r\nwere closely drawn. The hall door was on my right. It was approached by\r\na little wooden gate.\r\n\r\nThe house itself was so close to the public road that by leaning over\r\nthe wall I could have touched either of the windows on the lower floor.\r\nThere were two of them. One of them was a bow window. The bow window\r\nwas open. The bottom centre sash was raised about six inches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER II.\r\n INSIDE\r\n\r\nI realised, and, so to speak, mentally photographed all the little\r\ndetails of the house in front of which I was standing with what almost\r\namounted to a gleam of preternatural perception. An instant before, the\r\nworld swam before my eyes. I saw nothing. Now I saw everything, with a\r\nclearness which, as it were, was shocking.\r\n\r\nAbove all, I saw the open window. I stared at it, conscious, as I did\r\nso, of a curious catching of the breath. It was so near to me; so very\r\nnear. I had but to stretch out my hand to thrust it through the\r\naperture. Once inside, my hand would at least be dry. How it rained out\r\nthere! My scanty clothing was soaked; I was wet to the skin! I was\r\nshivering. And, each second, it seemed to rain still faster. My teeth\r\nwere chattering. The damp was liquefying the very marrow in my bones.\r\n\r\nAnd, inside that open window, it was, it must be, so warm, so dry!\r\n\r\nThere was not a soul in sight. Not a human being anywhere near. I\r\nlistened; there was not a sound. I alone was at the mercy of the sodden\r\nnight. Of all God\xe2\x80\x99s creatures the only one unsheltered from the\r\nfountains of Heaven which He had opened. There was not one to see what\r\nI might do; not one to care. I need fear no spy.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the house was empty; nay, probably. It was my plain duty to\r\nknock at the door, rouse the inmates, and call attention to their\r\noversight,--the open window. The least they could do would be to reward\r\nme for my pains. But, suppose the place was empty, what would be the use\r\nof knocking? It would be to make a useless clatter. Possibly to disturb\r\nthe neighbourhood, for nothing. And, even if the people were at home, I\r\nmight go unrewarded. I had learned, in a hard school, the world\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ningratitude. To have caused the window to be closed--the inviting\r\nwindow, the tempting window, the convenient window!--and then to be no\r\nbetter for it after all, but still to be penniless, hopeless, hungry,\r\nout in the cold and the rain--better anything than that. In such a\r\nsituation, too late, I should say to myself that mine had been the\r\nconduct of a fool. And I should say it justly too. To be sure.\r\n\r\nLeaning over the low wall I found that I could very easily put my hand\r\ninside the room. How warm it was in there! I could feel the difference\r\nof temperature in my fingertips. Very quietly I stepped right over the\r\nwall. There was just room to stand in comfort between the window and\r\nthe wall. The ground felt to the foot as if it were cemented. Stooping\r\ndown, I peered through the opening. I could see nothing. It was black\r\nas pitch inside. The blind was drawn right up; it seemed incredible\r\nthat anyone could be at home, and have gone to bed, leaving the blind\r\nup, and the window open. I placed my ear to the crevice. How still it\r\nwas! Beyond doubt, the place was empty.\r\n\r\nI decided to push the window up another inch or two, so as to enable me\r\nto reconnoitre. If anyone caught me in the act, then there would be an\r\nopportunity to describe the circumstances, and to explain how I was\r\njust on the point of giving the alarm. Only, I must go carefully. In\r\nsuch damp weather it was probable that the sash would creak.\r\n\r\nNot a bit of it. It moved as readily and as noiselessly as if it had\r\nbeen oiled. This silence of the sash so emboldened me that I raised it\r\nmore than I intended. In fact, as far as it would go. Not by a sound\r\ndid it betray me. Bending over the sill I put my head and half my body\r\ninto the room. But I was no forwarder. I could see nothing. Not a\r\nthing. For all I could tell the room might be unfurnished. Indeed, the\r\nlikelihood of such an explanation began to occur to me. I might have\r\nchanced upon an empty house. In the darkness there was nothing to\r\nsuggest the contrary. What was I to do?\r\n\r\nWell, if the house was empty, in such a plight as mine I might be said\r\nto have a moral, if not a legal, right, to its bare shelter. Who, with\r\na heart in his bosom, would deny it me? Hardly the most punctilious\r\nlandlord. Raising myself by means of the sill I slipped my legs into\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nThe moment I did so I became conscious that, at any rate, the room was\r\nnot entirely unfurnished. The floor was carpeted. I have had my feet on\r\nsome good carpets in my time; I know what carpets are; but never did I\r\nstand upon a softer one than that. It reminded me, somehow, even then,\r\nof the turf in Richmond Park,--it caressed my instep, and sprang\r\nbeneath my tread. To my poor, travel-worn feet, it was luxury after the\r\npuddly, uneven road. Should I, now I had ascertained that the room\r\nwas, at least, partially furnished, beat a retreat? Or should I push my\r\nresearches further? It would have been rapture to have thrown off my\r\nclothes, and to have sunk down, on the carpet, then and there, to\r\nsleep. But,--I was so hungry, so famine-goaded; what would I not have\r\ngiven to have lighted on something good to eat!\r\n\r\nI moved a step or two forward, gingerly, reaching out with my hands,\r\nlest I struck, unawares, against some unseen thing. When I had taken\r\nthree or four such steps, without encountering an obstacle, or, indeed,\r\nanything at all, I began, all at once, to wish I had not seen the\r\nhouse; that I had passed it by; that I had not come through the window;\r\nthat I were safely out of it again. I became, on a sudden, aware, that\r\nsomething was with me in the room. There was nothing, ostensible, to\r\nlead me to such a conviction; it may be that my faculties were\r\nunnaturally keen; but, all at once, I knew that there was something\r\nthere. What was more, I had a horrible persuasion that, though\r\nunseeing, I was seen; that my every movement was being watched.\r\n\r\nWhat it was that was with me I could not tell; I could not even guess.\r\nIt was as though something in my mental organisation had been stricken\r\nby a sudden paralysis. It may seem childish to use such language; but I\r\nwas overwrought, played out; physically speaking, at my last counter;\r\nand, in an instant, without the slightest warning, I was conscious of a\r\nvery curious sensation, the like of which I had never felt before, and\r\nthe like of which I pray that I never may feel again,--a sensation of\r\npanic fear. I remained rooted to the spot on which I stood, not daring\r\nto move, fearing to draw my breath. I felt that the presence with me in\r\nthe room was something strange, something evil.\r\n\r\nI do not know how long I stood there, spell-bound, but certainly for\r\nsome considerable space of time. By degrees, as nothing moved, nothing\r\nwas seen, nothing was heard, and nothing happened, I made an effort to\r\nbetter play the man. I knew that, at the moment, I played the cur. And\r\nendeavoured to ask myself of what it was I was afraid. I was shivering\r\nat my own imaginings. What could be in the room, to have suffered me to\r\nopen the window and to enter unopposed? Whatever it was, was surely to\r\nthe full as great a coward as I was, or why permit, unchecked, my\r\nburglarious entry. Since I had been allowed to enter, the probability\r\nwas that I should be at liberty to retreat,--and I was sensible of a\r\nmuch keener desire to retreat than I had ever had to enter.\r\n\r\nI had to put the greatest amount of pressure upon myself before I could\r\nsummon up sufficient courage to enable me to even turn my head upon my\r\nshoulders,--and the moment I did so I turned it back again. What\r\nconstrained me, to save my soul I could not have said,--but I was\r\nconstrained. My heart was palpitating in my bosom; I could hear it\r\nbeat. I was trembling so that I could scarcely stand. I was overwhelmed\r\nby a fresh flood of terror. I stared in front of me with eyes in which,\r\nhad it been light, would have been seen the frenzy of unreasoning fear.\r\nMy ears were strained so that I listened with an acuteness of tension\r\nwhich was painful.\r\n\r\nSomething moved. Slightly, with so slight a sound, that it would\r\nscarcely have been audible to other ears save mine. But I heard. I was\r\nlooking in the direction from which the movement came, and, as I\r\nlooked, I saw in front of me two specks of light. They had not been\r\nthere a moment before, that I would swear. They were there now. They\r\nwere eyes,--I told myself they were eyes. I had heard how cats\xe2\x80\x99 eyes\r\ngleam in the dark, though I had never seen them, and I said to myself\r\nthat these were cats\xe2\x80\x99 eyes; that the thing in front of me was nothing\r\nbut a cat. But I knew I lied. I knew that these were eyes, and I knew\r\nthey were not cats\xe2\x80\x99 eyes, but what eyes they were I did not know,--nor\r\ndared to think.\r\n\r\nThey moved,--towards me. The creature to which the eyes belonged was\r\ncoming closer. So intense was my desire to fly that I would much rather\r\nhave died than stood there still; yet I could not control a limb; my\r\nlimbs were as if they were not mine. The eyes came on,--noiselessly. At\r\nfirst they were between two and three feet from the ground; but, on a\r\nsudden, there was a squelching sound, as if some yielding body had been\r\nsquashed upon the floor. The eyes vanished,--to reappear, a moment\r\nafterwards, at what I judged to be a distance of some six inches from\r\nthe floor. And they again came on.\r\n\r\nSo it seemed that the creature, whatever it was to which the eyes\r\nbelonged, was, after all, but small. Why I did not obey the frantic\r\nlonging which I had to flee from it, I cannot tell; I only know, I\r\ncould not. I take it that the stress and privations which I had lately\r\nundergone, and which I was, even then, still undergoing, had much to do\r\nwith my conduct at that moment, and with the part I played in all that\r\nfollowed. Ordinarily I believe that I have as high a spirit as the\r\naverage man, and as solid a resolution; but when one has been dragged\r\nthrough the Valley of Humiliation, and plunged, again and again, into\r\nthe Waters of Bitterness and Privation, a man can be constrained to a\r\ncourse of action of which, in his happier moments, he would have deemed\r\nhimself incapable. I know this of my own knowledge.\r\n\r\nSlowly the eyes came on, with a strange slowness, and as they came they\r\nmoved from side to side as if their owner walked unevenly. Nothing\r\ncould have exceeded the horror with which I awaited their\r\napproach,--except my incapacity to escape them. Not for an instant did\r\nmy glance pass from them,--I could not have shut my eyes for all the\r\ngold the world contains!--so that as they came closer I had to look\r\nright down to what seemed to be almost the level of my feet. And, at\r\nlast, they reached my feet. They never paused. On a sudden I felt\r\nsomething on my boot, and, with a sense of shrinking, horror, nausea,\r\nrendering me momentarily more helpless, I realised that the creature\r\nwas beginning to ascend my legs, to climb my body. Even then what it\r\nwas I could not tell,--it mounted me, apparently, with as much ease as\r\nif I had been horizontal instead of perpendicular. It was as though it\r\nwere some gigantic spider,--a spider of the nightmares; a monstrous\r\nconception of some dreadful vision. It pressed lightly against my\r\nclothing with what might, for all the world, have been spider\xe2\x80\x99s legs.\r\nThere was an amazing host of them,--I felt the pressure of each\r\nseparate one. They embraced me softly, stickily, as if the creature\r\nglued and unglued them, each time it moved.\r\n\r\nHigher and higher! It had gained my loins. It was moving towards the\r\npit of my stomach. The helplessness with which I suffered its invasion\r\nwas not the least part of my agony,--it was that helplessness which we\r\nknow in dreadful dreams. I understood, quite well, that if I did but\r\ngive myself a hearty shake, the creature would fall off; but I had not\r\na muscle at my command.\r\n\r\nAs the creature mounted its eyes began to play the part of two small\r\nlamps; they positively emitted rays of light. By their rays I began to\r\nperceive faint outlines of its body. It seemed larger than I had\r\nsupposed. Either the body itself was slightly phosphorescent, or it was\r\nof a peculiar yellow hue. It gleamed in the darkness. What it was there\r\nwas still nothing to positively show, but the impression grew upon me\r\nthat it was some member of the spider family, some monstrous member, of\r\nthe like of which I had never heard or read. It was heavy, so heavy\r\nindeed, that I wondered how, with so slight a pressure, it managed to\r\nretain its hold,--that it did so by the aid of some adhesive substance\r\nat the end of its legs I was sure,--I could feel it stick. Its weight\r\nincreased as it ascended,--and it smelt! I had been for some time aware\r\nthat it emitted an unpleasant, foetid odour; as it neared my face it\r\nbecame so intense as to be unbearable.\r\n\r\nIt was at my chest. I became more and more conscious of an\r\nuncomfortable wobbling motion, as if each time it breathed its body\r\nheaved. Its forelegs touched the bare skin about the base of my neck;\r\nthey stuck to it,--shall I ever forget the feeling? I have it often in\r\nmy dreams. While it hung on with those in front it seemed to draw its\r\nother legs up after it. It crawled up my neck, with hideous slowness, a\r\nquarter of an inch at a time, its weight compelling me to brace the\r\nmuscles of my back. It reached my chin, it touched my lips,--and I\r\nstood still and bore it all, while it enveloped my face with its huge,\r\nslimy, evil-smelling body, and embraced me with its myriad legs. The\r\nhorror of it made me mad. I shook myself like one stricken by the\r\nshaking ague. I shook the creature off. It squashed upon the floor.\r\nShrieking like some lost spirit, turning, I dashed towards the window.\r\nAs I went, my foot, catching in some obstacle, I fell headlong to the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nPicking myself up as quickly as I could I resumed my flight,--rain or\r\nno rain, oh to get out of that room! I already had my hand upon the\r\nsill, in another instant I should have been over it,--then, despite my\r\nhunger, my fatigues, let anyone have stopped me if they could!--when\r\nsomeone behind me struck a light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER III.\r\n THE MAN IN THE BED\r\n\r\nThe illumination which instantly followed was unexpected. It startled\r\nme, causing a moment\xe2\x80\x99s check, from which I was just recovering when a\r\nvoice said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Keep still!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a quality in the voice which I cannot describe. Not only an\r\naccent of command, but a something malicious, a something saturnine. It\r\nwas a little guttural, though whether it was a man speaking I could not\r\nhave positively said; but I had no doubt it was a foreigner. It was the\r\nmost disagreeable voice I had ever heard, and it had on me the most\r\ndisagreeable effect; for when it said, \xe2\x80\x98Keep still!\xe2\x80\x99 I kept still. It\r\nwas as though there was nothing else for me to do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Turn round!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI turned round, mechanically, like an automaton. Such passivity was\r\nworse than undignified, it was galling; I knew that well. I resented it\r\nwith secret rage. But in that room, in that presence, I was\r\ninvertebrate.\r\n\r\nWhen I turned I found myself confronting someone who was lying in bed.\r\nAt the head of the bed was a shelf. On the shelf was a small lamp which\r\ngave the most brilliant light I had ever seen. It caught me full in the\r\neyes, having on me such a blinding effect that for some seconds I could\r\nsee nothing. Throughout the whole of that strange interview I cannot\r\naffirm that I saw clearly; the dazzling glare caused dancing specks to\r\nobscure my vision. Yet, after an interval of time, I did see something;\r\nand what I did see I had rather have left unseen.\r\n\r\n\r\n [IMAGE: images/img_017.jpg\r\n CAPTION: FOR WHEN IT SAID, \xe2\x80\x98KEEP STILL!\xe2\x80\x99 I KEPT STILL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI saw someone in front of me lying in a bed. I could not at once decide\r\nif it was a man or a woman. Indeed at first I doubted if it was\r\nanything human. But, afterwards, I knew it to be a man,--for this\r\nreason, if for no other, that it was impossible such a creature could\r\nbe feminine. The bedclothes were drawn up to his shoulders; only his\r\nhead was visible. He lay on his left side, his head resting on his left\r\nhand; motionless, eyeing me as if he sought to read my inmost soul.\r\nAnd, in very truth, I believe he read it. His age I could not guess;\r\nsuch a look of age I had never imagined. Had he asserted that he had\r\nbeen living through the ages, I should have been forced to admit that,\r\nat least, he looked it. And yet I felt that it was quite within the\r\nrange of possibility that he was no older than myself,--there was a\r\nvitality in his eyes which was startling. It might have been that he\r\nhad been afflicted by some terrible disease, and it was that which had\r\nmade him so supernaturally ugly.\r\n\r\nThere was not a hair upon his face or head, but, to make up for it, the\r\nskin, which was a saffron yellow, was an amazing mass of wrinkles. The\r\ncranium, and, indeed, the whole skull, was so small as to be\r\ndisagreeably suggestive of something animal. The nose, on the other\r\nhand, was abnormally large; so extravagant were its dimensions, and so\r\npeculiar its shape, it resembled the beak of some bird of prey. A\r\ncharacteristic of the face--and an uncomfortable one!--was that,\r\npractically, it stopped short at the mouth. The mouth, with its blubber\r\nlips, came immediately underneath the nose, and chin, to all intents\r\nand purposes, there was none. This deformity--for the absence of chin\r\namounted to that--it was which gave to the face the appearance of\r\nsomething not human,--that, and the eyes. For so marked a feature of\r\nthe man were his eyes, that, ere long, it seemed to me that he was\r\nnothing but eyes.\r\n\r\nHis eyes ran, literally, across the whole of the upper portion of his\r\nface,--remember, the face was unwontedly small, and the columna of the\r\nnose was razor-edged. They were long, and they looked out of narrow\r\nwindows, and they seemed to be lighted by some internal radiance, for\r\nthey shone out like lamps in a lighthouse tower. Escape them I could\r\nnot, while, as I endeavoured to meet them, it was as if I shrivelled\r\ninto nothingness. Never before had I realised what was meant by the\r\npower of the eye. They held me enchained, helpless, spell-bound. I felt\r\nthat they could do with me as they would; and they did. Their gaze was\r\nunfaltering, having the bird-like trick of never blinking; this man\r\ncould have glared at me for hours and never moved an eyelid.\r\n\r\nIt was he who broke the silence. I was speechless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shut the window.\xe2\x80\x99 I did as he bade me. \xe2\x80\x98Pull down the blind.\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nobeyed. \xe2\x80\x98Turn round again.\xe2\x80\x99 I was still obedient. \xe2\x80\x98What is your name?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen I spoke,--to answer him. There was this odd thing about the words\r\nI uttered, that they came from me, not in response to my will power,\r\nbut in response to his. It was not I who willed that I should speak; it\r\nwas he. What he willed that I should say, I said. Just that, and\r\nnothing more. For the time I was no longer a man; my manhood was merged\r\nin his. I was, in the extremest sense, an example of passive obedience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Robert Holt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What are you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A clerk.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You look as if you were a clerk.\xe2\x80\x99 There was a flame of scorn in his\r\nvoice which scorched me even then. \xe2\x80\x98What sort of a clerk are you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am out of a situation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You look as if you were out of a situation.\xe2\x80\x99 Again the scorn. \xe2\x80\x98Are you\r\nthe sort of clerk who is always out of a situation? You are a thief.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not a thief.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do clerks come through the window?\xe2\x80\x99 I was still,--he putting no\r\nconstraint on me to speak. \xe2\x80\x98Why did you come through the window?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because it was open.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So!--Do you always come through a window which is open?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then why through this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because I was wet--and cold--and hungry--and tired.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe words came from me as if he had dragged them one by one,--which, in\r\nfact, he did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you no home?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Money?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Friends?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then what sort of a clerk are you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI did not answer him,--I did not know what it was he wished me to say.\r\nI was the victim of bad luck, nothing else,--I swear it. Misfortune had\r\nfollowed hard upon misfortune. The firm by whom I had been employed for\r\nyears suspended payment. I obtained a situation with one of their\r\ncreditors, at a lower salary. They reduced their staff, which entailed\r\nmy going. After an interval I obtained a temporary engagement; the\r\noccasion which required my services passed, and I with it. After\r\nanother, and a longer interval, I again found temporary employment, the\r\npay for which was but a pittance. When that was over I could find\r\nnothing. That was nine months ago, and since then I had not earned a\r\npenny. It is so easy to grow shabby, when you are on the everlasting\r\ntramp, and are living on your stock of clothes. I had trudged all over\r\nLondon in search of work,--work of any kind would have been welcome, so\r\nlong as it would have enabled me to keep body and soul together. And I\r\nhad trudged in vain. Now I had been refused admittance as a\r\ncasual,--how easy is the descent! But I did not tell the man lying on\r\nthe bed all this. He did not wish to hear,--had he wished he would have\r\nmade me tell him.\r\n\r\nIt may be that he read my story, unspoken though it was,--it is\r\nconceivable. His eyes had powers of penetration which were peculiarly\r\ntheir own,--that I know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Undress!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen he spoke again that was what he said, in those guttural tones of\r\nhis in which there was a reminiscence of some foreign land. I obeyed,\r\nletting my sodden, shabby clothes fall anyhow upon the floor. A look\r\ncame on his face, as I stood naked in front of him, which, if it was\r\nmeant for a smile, was a satyr\xe2\x80\x99s smile, and which filled me with a\r\nsensation of shuddering repulsion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a white skin you have,--how white! What would I not give for a\r\nskin as white as that,--ah yes!\xe2\x80\x99 He paused, devouring me with his\r\nglances; then continued. \xe2\x80\x98Go to the cupboard; you will find a cloak;\r\nput it on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI went to a cupboard which was in a corner of the room, his eyes\r\nfollowing me as I moved. It was full of clothing,--garments which might\r\nhave formed the stock-in-trade of a costumier whose speciality was\r\nproviding costumes for masquerades. A long dark cloak hung on a peg. My\r\nhand moved towards it, apparently of its own volition. I put it on, its\r\nample folds falling to my feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the other cupboard you will find meat, and bread, and wine. Eat and\r\ndrink.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the room, near the head of his bed, there was a\r\nsecond cupboard. In this, upon a shelf, I found what looked like\r\npressed beef, several round cakes of what tasted like rye bread, and\r\nsome thin, sour wine, in a straw-covered flask. But I was in no mood to\r\ncriticise; I crammed myself, I believe, like some famished wolf, he\r\nwatching me, in silence, all the time. When I had done, which was when\r\nI had eaten and drunk as much as I could hold, there returned to his\r\nface that satyr\xe2\x80\x99s grin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would that I could eat and drink like that,--ah yes!--Put back what\r\nis left.\xe2\x80\x99 I put it back,--which seemed an unnecessary exertion, there\r\nwas so little to put. \xe2\x80\x98Look me in the face.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI looked him in the face,--and immediately became conscious, as I did\r\nso, that something was going from me,--the capacity, as it were, to be\r\nmyself. His eyes grew larger and larger, till they seemed to fill all\r\nspace--till I became lost in their immensity. He moved his hand, doing\r\nsomething to me, I know not what, as it passed through the air--cutting\r\nthe solid ground from underneath my feet, so that I fell headlong to\r\nthe ground. Where I fell, there I lay, like a log.\r\n\r\nAnd the light went out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER IV.\r\n A LONELY VIGIL\r\n\r\nI knew that the light went out. For not the least singular, nor,\r\nindeed, the least distressing part of my condition was the fact that,\r\nto the best of my knowledge and belief, I never once lost consciousness\r\nduring the long hours which followed. I was aware of the extinction of\r\nthe lamp, and of the black darkness which ensued. I heard a rustling\r\nsound, as if the man in the bed was settling himself between the\r\nsheets. Then all was still. And throughout that interminable night I\r\nremained, my brain awake, my body dead, waiting, watching, for the day.\r\nWhat had happened to me I could not guess. That I probably wore some of\r\nthe external evidences of death my instinct told me,--I knew I did.\r\nParadoxical though it may sound, I felt as a man might feel who had\r\nactually died,--as, in moments of speculation, in the days gone by, I\r\nhad imagined it as quite possible that he would feel. It is very far\r\nfrom certain that feeling necessarily expires with what we call life. I\r\ncontinually asked myself if I could be dead,--the inquiry pressed\r\nitself on me with awful iteration. Does the body die, and the\r\nbrain--the I, the ego--still live on? God only knows. But, then! the\r\nagony of the thought.\r\n\r\nThe hours passed. By slow degrees, the silence was eclipsed. Sounds of\r\ntraffic, of hurrying footsteps,--life!--were ushers of the morn.\r\nOutside the window sparrows twittered,--a cat mewed, a dog\r\nbarked--there was the clatter of a milk can. Shafts of light stole past\r\nthe blind, increasing in intensity. It still rained, now and again it\r\npattered against the pane. The wind must have shifted, because, for the\r\nfirst time, there came, on a sudden, the clang of a distant clock\r\nstriking the hour,--seven. Then, with the interval of a lifetime\r\nbetween each chiming, eight,--nine,--ten.\r\n\r\nSo far, in the room itself there had not been a sound. When the clock\r\nhad struck ten, as it seemed to me, years ago, there came a rustling\r\nnoise, from the direction of the bed. Feet stepped upon the\r\nfloor,--moving towards where I was lying. It was, of course, now broad\r\nday, and I, presently, perceived that a figure, clad in some queer\r\ncoloured garment, was standing at my side, looking down at me. It\r\nstooped, then knelt. My only covering was unceremoniously thrown from\r\noff me, so that I lay there in my nakedness. Fingers prodded me then\r\nand there, as if I had been some beast ready for the butcher\xe2\x80\x99s stall. A\r\nface looked into mine, and, in front of me, were those dreadful eyes.\r\nThen, whether I was dead or living, I said to myself that this could be\r\nnothing human,--nothing fashioned in God\xe2\x80\x99s image could wear such a\r\nshape as that. Fingers were pressed into my cheeks, they were thrust\r\ninto my mouth, they touched my staring eyes, shut my eyelids, then\r\nopened them again, and--horror of horrors!--the blubber lips were\r\npressed to mine--the soul of something evil entered into me in the\r\nguise of a kiss.\r\n\r\nThen this travesty of manhood reascended to his feet, and said, whether\r\nspeaking to me or to himself I could not tell,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dead!--dead!--as good as dead!--and better! We\xe2\x80\x99ll have him buried.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe moved away from me. I heard a door open and shut, and knew that he\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nAnd he continued gone throughout the day. I had no actual knowledge of\r\nhis issuing out into the street, but he must have done so, because the\r\nhouse appeared deserted. What had become of the dreadful creature of\r\nthe night before I could not guess. My first fear was that he had left\r\nit behind him in the room with me,--it might be, as a sort of watchdog.\r\nBut, as the minutes and the hours passed, and there was still no sign\r\nor sound of anything living, I concluded that, if the thing was there,\r\nit was, possibly, as helpless as myself, and that during its owner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabsence, at any rate, I had nothing to fear from its too pressing\r\nattentions.\r\n\r\nThat, with the exception of myself, the house held nothing human, I had\r\nstrong presumptive proof more than once in the course of the day.\r\nSeveral times, both in the morning and the afternoon, people without\r\nendeavoured to attract the attention of whoever was within.\r\nVehicles--probably tradesmen\xe2\x80\x99s carts--drew up in front, their stopping\r\nbeing followed by more or less assiduous assaults upon the knocker and\r\nthe bell. But in every case their appeals remained unheeded. Whatever\r\nit was they wanted, they had to go unsatisfied away. Lying there,\r\ntorpid, with nothing to do but listen, I was, possibly, struck by very\r\nlittle, but it did occur to me that one among the callers was more\r\npersistent than the rest.\r\n\r\nThe distant clock had just struck noon when I heard the gate open, and\r\nsomeone approached the front door. Since nothing but silence followed,\r\nI supposed that the occupant of the place had returned, and had chosen\r\nto do so as silently as he had gone. Presently, however, there came\r\nfrom the doorstep a slight but peculiar call, as if a rat was\r\nsqueaking. It was repeated three times, and then there was the sound of\r\nfootsteps quietly retreating, and the gate re-closing. Between one and\r\ntwo the caller came again; there was a repetition of the same\r\nsignal,--that it was a signal I did not doubt; followed by the same\r\nretreat. About three the mysterious visitant returned. The signal was\r\nrepeated, and, when there was no response, fingers tapped softly\r\nagainst the panels of the front door. When there was still no answer,\r\nfootsteps stole softly round the side of the house, and there came the\r\nsignal from the rear,--and then, again, tapping of fingers against what\r\nwas, apparently, the back door. No notice being taken of these various\r\nproceedings, the footsteps returned the way they went, and, as before,\r\nthe gate was closed.\r\n\r\nShortly after darkness had fallen this assiduous caller returned, to\r\nmake a fourth and more resolute attempt to call attention to his\r\npresence. From the peculiar character of his manoeuvres it seemed that\r\nhe suspected that whoever was within had particular reasons for\r\nignoring him without. He went through the familiar pantomime of the\r\nthree squeaky calls both at the front door and the back,--followed by\r\nthe tapping of the fingers on the panels. This time, however, he also\r\ntried the window panes,--I could hear, quite distinctly, the clear, yet\r\ndistinct, noise of what seemed like knuckles rapping against the\r\nwindows behind. Disappointed there, he renewed his efforts at the\r\nfront. The curiously quiet footsteps came round the house, to pause\r\nbefore the window of the room in which I lay,--and then something\r\nsingular occurred.\r\n\r\nWhile I waited for the tapping, there came, instead, the sound of\r\nsomeone or something, scrambling on to the window-sill,--as if some\r\ncreature, unable to reach the window from the ground, was endeavouring\r\nto gain the vantage of the sill. Some ungainly creature, unskilled in\r\nsurmounting such an obstacle as a perpendicular brick wall. There was\r\nthe noise of what seemed to be the scratching of claws, as if it\r\nexperienced considerable difficulty in obtaining a hold on the\r\nunyielding surface. What kind of creature it was I could not think,--I\r\nwas astonished to find that it was a creature at all. I had taken it\r\nfor granted that the persevering visitor was either a woman or a man.\r\nIf, however, as now seemed likely, it was some sort of animal, the fact\r\nexplained the squeaking sounds,--though what, except a rat, did squeak\r\nlike that was more than I could say--and the absence of any knocking or\r\nringing.\r\n\r\nWhatever it was, it had gained the summit of its desires,--the\r\nwindow-sill. It panted as if its efforts at climbing had made it short\r\nof breath. Then began the tapping. In the light of my new discovery, I\r\nperceived, clearly enough, that the tapping was hardly that which was\r\nlikely to be the product of human fingers,--it was sharp and definite,\r\nrather resembling the striking of the point of a nail against the\r\nglass. It was not loud, but in time--it continued with much\r\npersistency--it became plainly vicious. It was accompanied by what I\r\ncan only describe as the most extraordinary noises. There were squeaks,\r\ngrowing angrier and shriller as the minutes passed; what seemed like\r\ngaspings for breath; and a peculiar buzzing sound like, yet unlike, the\r\npurring of a cat.\r\n\r\nThe creature\xe2\x80\x99s resentment at its want of success in attracting\r\nattention was unmistakable. The tapping became like the clattering of\r\nhailstones; it kept up a continuous noise with its cries and pantings;\r\nthere was the sound as of some large body being rubbed against the\r\nglass, as if it were extending itself against the window, and\r\nendeavouring, by force of pressure, to gain an entrance through the\r\npane. So violent did its contortions become that I momentarily\r\nanticipated the yielding of the glass, and the excited assailant coming\r\ncrashing through. Considerably to my relief the window proved more\r\nimpregnable than seemed at one time likely. The stolid resistance\r\nproved, in the end, to be too much either for its endurance or its\r\npatience. Just as I was looking for some fresh manifestation of fury,\r\nit seemed rather to tumble than to spring off the sill; then came, once\r\nmore, the same sound of quietly retreating footsteps; and what, under\r\nthe circumstances, seemed odder still, the same closing of the gate.\r\n\r\nDuring the two or three hours which immediately ensued nothing happened\r\nat all out of the way,--and then took place the most surprising\r\nincident of all. The clock had struck ten some time before. Since\r\nbefore the striking of the hour nothing and no one had passed along\r\nwhat was evidently the little frequented road in front of that uncanny\r\nhouse. On a sudden two sounds broke the stillness without,--of someone\r\nrunning, and of cries. Judging from his hurrying steps someone seemed\r\nto be flying for his life,--to the accompaniment of curious cries. It\r\nwas only when the runner reached the front of the house that, in the\r\ncries, I recognised the squeaks of the persistent caller. I imagined\r\nthat he had returned, as before, alone, to renew his attacks upon the\r\nwindow,--until it was made plain, as it quickly was, that, with him,\r\nwas some sort of a companion. Immediately there arose, from without,\r\nthe noise of battle. Two creatures, whose cries were, to me, of so\r\nunusual a character, that I found it impossible to even guess at their\r\nidentity, seemed to be waging war to the knife upon the doorstep. After\r\na minute or two of furious contention, victory seemed to rest with one\r\nof the combatants, for the other fled, squeaking as with pain. While I\r\nlistened, with strained attention, for the next episode in this queer\r\ndrama, expecting that now would come another assault upon the window,\r\nto my unbounded surprise I heard a key thrust in the keyhole, the lock\r\nturned, and the front door thrown open with a furious bang. It was\r\nclosed as loudly as it was opened. Then the door of the room in which I\r\nwas, was dashed open, with the same display of excitement, and of\r\nclamour, footsteps came hurrying in, the door was slammed to with a\r\nforce which shook the house to its foundations, there was a rustling as\r\nof bed-clothes, the brilliant illumination of the night before, and a\r\nvoice, which I had only too good reason to remember said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stand up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI stood up, automatically, at the word of command, facing towards the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nThere, between the sheets, with his head resting on his hand, in the\r\nattitude in which I had seen him last, was the being I had made\r\nacquaintance with under circumstances which I was never likely to\r\nforget,--the same, yet not the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER V.\r\n AN INSTRUCTION TO COMMIT BURGLARY\r\n\r\nThat the man in the bed was the one whom, to my cost, I had suffered\r\nmyself to stumble on the night before, there could, of course, not be\r\nthe faintest doubt. And yet, directly I saw him, I recognised that some\r\nastonishing alteration had taken place in his appearance. To begin\r\nwith, he seemed younger,--the decrepitude of age had given place to\r\nsomething very like the fire of youth. His features had undergone some\r\nsubtle change. His nose, for instance, was not by any means so\r\ngrotesque; its beak-like quality was less conspicuous. The most part of\r\nhis wrinkles had disappeared, as if by magic. And, though his skin was\r\nstill as yellow as saffron, his contours had rounded,--he had even come\r\ninto possession of a modest allowance of chin. But the most astounding\r\nnovelty was that about the face there was something which was\r\nessentially feminine; so feminine, indeed, that I wondered if I could\r\nby any possibility have blundered, and mistaken a woman for a man; some\r\nghoulish example of her sex, who had so yielded to her depraved\r\ninstincts as to have become nothing but a ghastly reminiscence of\r\nwomanhood.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the changes which had come about in his appearance--for,\r\nafter all, I told myself that it was impossible that I could have been\r\nsuch a simpleton as to have been mistaken on such a question as\r\ngender--was heightened by the self-evident fact that, very recently, he\r\nhad been engaged in some pitched battle; some hand to hand, and,\r\nprobably, discreditable encounter, from which he had borne away\r\nuncomfortable proofs of his opponent\xe2\x80\x99s prowess. His antagonist could\r\nhardly have been a chivalrous fighter, for his countenance was marked\r\nby a dozen different scratches which seemed to suggest that the weapons\r\nused had been someone\xe2\x80\x99s finger-nails. It was, perhaps, because the heat\r\nof the battle was still in his veins that he was in such a state of\r\nexcitement. He seemed to be almost overwhelmed by the strength of his\r\nown feelings. His eyes seemed literally to flame with fire. The muscles\r\nof his face were working as if they were wholly beyond his own control.\r\nWhen he spoke his accent was markedly foreign; the words rushed from\r\nhis lips in an inarticulate torrent; he kept repeating the same thing\r\nover and over again in a fashion which was not a little suggestive of\r\ninsanity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So you\xe2\x80\x99re not dead!--you\xe2\x80\x99re not dead:--you\xe2\x80\x99re alive!--you\xe2\x80\x99re alive!\r\nWell,--how does it feel to be dead? I ask you!--Is it not good to be\r\ndead? To keep dead is better,--it is the best of all! To have made an\r\nend of all things, to cease to strive and to cease to weep, to cease to\r\nwant and to cease to have, to cease to annoy and to cease to long, to\r\nno more care,--no!--not for anything, to put from you the curse of\r\nlife,--forever!--is that not the best? Oh yes!--I tell you!--do I not\r\nknow? But for you such knowledge is not yet. For you there is the\r\nreturn to life, the coming out of death,--you shall live on!--for\r\nme!--Live on!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe made a movement with his hand, and, directly he did so, it happened\r\nas on the previous evening, that a metamorphosis took place in the very\r\nabysses of my being. I woke from my torpor, as he put it, I came out of\r\ndeath, and was alive again. I was far, yet, from being my own man; I\r\nrealised that he exercised on me a degree of mesmeric force which I had\r\nnever dreamed that one creature could exercise on another; but, at\r\nleast, I was no longer in doubt as to whether I was or was not dead. I\r\nknew I was alive.\r\n\r\nHe lay, watching me, as if he was reading the thoughts which occupied\r\nmy brain,--and, for all I know, he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Robert Holt, you are a thief.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMy own voice, as I heard it, startled me,--it was so long since it had\r\nsounded in my ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are a thief! Only thieves come through windows,--did you not come\r\nthrough the window?\xe2\x80\x99 I was still,--what would my contradiction have\r\navailed me? \xe2\x80\x98But it is well that you came through the window,--well you\r\nare a thief,--well for me! for me! It is you that I am wanting,--at the\r\nhappy moment you have dropped yourself into my hands,--in the nick of\r\ntime. For you are my slave,--at my beck and call,--my familiar spirit,\r\nto do with as I will,--you know this,--eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI did know it, and the knowledge of my impotence was terrible. I felt\r\nthat if I could only get away from him; only release myself from the\r\nbonds with which he had bound me about; only remove myself from the\r\nhorrible glamour of his near neighbourhood; only get one or two square\r\nmeals and have an opportunity of recovering from the enervating stress\r\nof mental and bodily fatigue;--I felt that then I might be something\r\nlike his match, and that, a second time, he would endeavour in vain to\r\nbring me within the compass of his magic. But, as it was, I was\r\nconscious that I was helpless, and the consciousness was agony. He\r\npersisted in reiterating his former falsehood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say you are a thief!--a thief, Robert Holt, a thief! You came\r\nthrough a window for your own pleasure, now you will go through a\r\nwindow for mine,--not this window, but another.\xe2\x80\x99 Where the jest lay I\r\ndid not perceive; but it tickled him, for a grating sound came from his\r\nthroat which was meant for laughter. \xe2\x80\x98This time it is as a thief that\r\nyou will go,--oh yes, be sure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe paused, as it seemed, to transfix me with his gaze. His unblinking\r\neyes never for an instant quitted my face. With what a frightful\r\nfascination they constrained me,--and how I loathed them!\r\n\r\nWhen he spoke again there was a new intonation in his\r\nspeech,--something bitter, cruel, unrelenting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know Paul Lessingham?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe pronounced the name as if he hated it,--and yet as if he loved to\r\nhave it on his tongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What Paul Lessingham?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is only one Paul Lessingham! _The_ Paul Lessingham,--the\r\n_great_ Paul Lessingham!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe shrieked, rather than said this, with an outburst of rage so\r\nfrenzied that I thought, for the moment, that he was going to spring on\r\nme and rend me. I shook all over. I do not doubt that, as I replied, my\r\nvoice was sufficiently tremulous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All the world knows Paul Lessingham,--the politician,--the statesman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he glared at me his eyes dilated. I still stood in expectation of a\r\nphysical assault. But, for the present, he contented himself with words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To-night you are going through his window like a thief!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI had no inkling of his meaning,--and, apparently, judging from his\r\nnext words, I looked something of the bewilderment I felt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You do not understand?--no!--it is simple!--what could be simpler? I\r\nsay that to-night--to-night!--you are going through his window like a\r\nthief. You came through my window,--why not through the window of Paul\r\nLessingham, the politician--the statesman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe repeated my words as if in mockery. I am--I make it my boast!--of\r\nthat great multitude which regards Paul Lessingham as the greatest\r\nliving force in practical politics; and which looks to him, with\r\nconfidence, to carry through that great work of constitutional and\r\nsocial reform which he has set himself to do. I daresay that my tone,\r\nin speaking of him, savoured of laudation,--which, plainly, the man in\r\nthe bed resented. What he meant by his wild words about my going\r\nthrough Paul Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s window like a thief, I still had not the\r\nfaintest notion. They sounded like the ravings of a madman.\r\n\r\nAs I continued silent, and he yet stared, there came into his tone\r\nanother note,--a note of tenderness,--a note of which I had not deemed\r\nhim capable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is good to look at, Paul Lessingham,--is he not good to look at?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI was aware that, physically, Mr Lessingham was a fine specimen of\r\nmanhood, but I was not prepared for the assertion of the fact in such a\r\nquarter,--nor for the manner in which the temporary master of my fate\r\ncontinued to harp and enlarge upon the theme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is straight,--straight as the mast of a ship,--he is tall,--his\r\nskin is white; he is strong--do I not know that he is strong--how\r\nstrong!--oh yes! Is there a better thing than to be his wife? his\r\nwell-beloved? the light of his eyes? Is there for a woman a happier\r\nchance? Oh no, not one! His wife!--Paul Lessingham!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs, with soft cadences, he gave vent to these unlooked-for sentiments,\r\nthe fashion of his countenance was changed. A look of longing came into\r\nhis face--of savage, frantic longing--which, unalluring though it was,\r\nfor the moment transfigured him. But the mood was transient.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be his wife,--oh yes!--the wife of his scorn! the despised and\r\nrejected!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe return to the venom of his former bitterness was rapid,--I could\r\nnot but feel that this was the natural man. Though why a creature such\r\nas he was should go out of his way to apostrophise, in such a manner, a\r\npublicist of Mr Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s eminence, surpassed my comprehension. Yet\r\nhe stuck to his subject like a leech,--as if it had been one in which\r\nhe had an engrossing personal interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is a devil,--hard as the granite rock,--cold as the snows of\r\nArarat. In him there is none of life\xe2\x80\x99s warm blood,--he is accursed! He\r\nis false,--ay, false as the fables of those who lie for love of\r\nlies,--he is all treachery. Her whom he has taken to his bosom he would\r\nput away from him as if she had never been,--he would steal from her\r\nlike a thief in the night,--he would forget she ever was! But the\r\navenger follows after, lurking in the shadows, hiding among the rocks,\r\nwaiting, watching, till his time shall come. And it shall come!--the\r\nday of the avenger!--ay, the day!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRaising himself to a sitting posture, he threw his arms above his head,\r\nand shrieked with a demoniac fury. Presently he became a trifle calmer.\r\nReverting to his recumbent position, resting his head upon his hand, he\r\neyed me steadily; then asked me a question which struck me as being,\r\nunder the circumstances, more than a little singular.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know his house,--the house of the great Paul Lessingham,--the\r\npolitician,--the statesman?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You lie!--you do!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe words came from him with a sort of snarl,--as if he would have\r\nlashed me across the face with them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not. Men in my position are not acquainted with the residences of\r\nmen in his. I may, at some time, have seen his address in print; but,\r\nif so, I have forgotten it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked at me intently, for some moments, as if to learn if I spoke\r\nthe truth; and apparently, at last, was satisfied that I did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You do not know it?--Well!--I will show it you,--I will show the house\r\nof the great Paul Lessingham.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhat he meant I did not know; but I was soon to learn,--an astounding\r\nrevelation it proved to be. There was about his manner something hardly\r\nhuman; something which, for want of a better phrase, I would call\r\nvulpine. In his tone there was a mixture of mockery and bitterness, as\r\nif he wished his words to have the effect of corrosive sublimate, and\r\nto sear me as he uttered them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Listen with all your ears. Give me your whole attention. Hearken to my\r\nbidding, so that you may do as I bid you. Not that I fear your\r\nobedience,--oh no!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe paused,--as if to enable me to fully realise the picture of my\r\nhelplessness conjured up by his jibes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You came through my window, like a thief. You will go through my\r\nwindow, like a fool. You will go to the house of the great Paul\r\nLessingham. You say you do not know it? Well, I will show it you. I\r\nwill be your guide. Unseen, in the darkness and the night, I will stalk\r\nbeside you, and will lead you to where I would have you go.--You will\r\ngo just as you are, with bare feet, and head uncovered, and with but a\r\nsingle garment to hide your nakedness. You will be cold, your feet will\r\nbe cut and bleeding,--but what better does a thief deserve? If any see\r\nyou, at the least they will take you for a madman; there will be\r\ntrouble. But have no fear; bear a bold heart. None shall see you while\r\nI stalk at your side. I will cover you with the cloak of\r\ninvisibility,--so that you may come in safety to the house of the great\r\nPaul Lessingham.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe paused again. What he said, wild and wanton though it was, was\r\nbeginning to fill me with a sense of the most extreme discomfort. His\r\nsentences, in some strange, indescribable way, seemed, as they came\r\nfrom his lips, to warp my limbs; to enwrap themselves about me; to\r\nconfine me, tighter and tighter, within, as it were, swaddling clothes;\r\nto make me more and more helpless. I was already conscious that\r\nwhatever mad freak he chose to set me on, I should have no option but\r\nto carry it through.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When you come to the house, you will stand, and look, and seek for a\r\nwindow convenient for entry. It may be that you will find one open, as\r\nyou did mine; if not, you will open one. How,--that is your affair, not\r\nmine. You will practise the arts of a thief to steal into his house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe monstrosity of his suggestion fought against the spell which he\r\nagain was casting upon me, and forced me into speech,--endowed me with\r\nthe power to show that there still was in me something of a man; though\r\nevery second the strands of my manhood, as it seemed, were slipping\r\nfaster through the fingers which were strained to clutch them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was silent. He looked at me. The pupils of his eyes dilated,--until\r\nthey seemed all pupil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will.--Do you hear?--I say you will.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not a thief, I am an honest man,--why should I do this thing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because I bid you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have mercy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On whom--on you, or on Paul Lessingham?--Who, at any time, has shown\r\nmercy unto me, that I should show mercy unto any?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and then again went on,--reiterating his former incredible\r\nsuggestion with an emphasis which seemed to eat its way into my brain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will practise the arts of a thief to steal into his house; and,\r\nbeing in, will listen. If all be still, you will make your way to the\r\nroom he calls his study.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How shall I find it? I know nothing of his house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe question was wrung from me; I felt that the sweat was standing in\r\ngreat drops upon my brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will show it you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall you go with me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay,--I shall go with you. All the time I shall be with you. You will\r\nnot see me, but I shall be there. Be not afraid.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis claim to supernatural powers, for what he said amounted to nothing\r\nless, was, on the face of it, preposterous, but, then, I was in no\r\ncondition to even hint at its absurdity. He continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When you have gained the study, you will go to a certain drawer, which\r\nis in a certain bureau, in a corner of the room--I see it now; when you\r\nare there you shall see it too--and you will open it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Should it be locked?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You still will open it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But how shall I open it if it is locked?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By those arts in which a thief is skilled. I say to you again that\r\nthat is your affair, not mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI made no attempt to answer him. Even supposing that he forced me, by\r\nthe wicked, and unconscionable exercise of what, I presumed, were the\r\nhypnotic powers with which nature had to such a dangerous degree\r\nendowed him, to carry the adventure to a certain stage, since he could\r\nhardly, at an instant\xe2\x80\x99s notice, endow me with the knack of picking\r\nlocks, should the drawer he alluded to be locked--which might\r\nProvidence permit!--nothing serious might issue from it after all. He\r\nread my thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will open it,--though it be doubly and trebly locked, I say that\r\nyou will open it.--In it you will find--\xe2\x80\x99 he hesitated, as if to\r\nreflect--\xe2\x80\x98some letters; it may be two or three,--I know not just how\r\nmany,--they are bound about by a silken ribbon. You will take them out\r\nof the drawer, and, having taken them, you will make the best of your\r\nway out of the house, and bear them back to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And should anyone come upon me while engaged in these nefarious\r\nproceedings,--for instance, should I encounter Mr Lessingham himself,\r\nwhat then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Paul Lessingham?--You need have no fear if you encounter him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I need have no fear!--If he finds me, in his own house, at dead of\r\nnight, committing burglary!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You need have no fear of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On your account, or on my own?--At least he will have me haled to\r\ngaol.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say you need have no fear of him. I say what I mean.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How, then, shall I escape his righteous vengeance? He is not the man\r\nto suffer a midnight robber to escape him scatheless,--shall I have to\r\nkill him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will not touch him with a finger,--nor will he touch you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By what spell shall I prevent him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By the spell of two words.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What words are they?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Should Paul Lessingham chance to come upon you, and find you in his\r\nhouse, a thief, and should seek to stay you from whatever it is you may\r\nbe at, you will not flinch nor flee from him, but you will stand still,\r\nand you will say--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSomething in the crescendo accents of his voice, something weird and\r\nominous, caused my heart to press against my ribs, so that when he\r\nstopped, in my eagerness I cried out,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98THE BEETLE!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs the words came from him in a kind of screech, the lamp went out, and\r\nthe place was all in darkness, and I knew, so that the knowledge filled\r\nme with a sense of loathing, that with me, in the room, was the evil\r\npresence of the night before. Two bright specks gleamed in front of me;\r\nsomething flopped from off the bed on to the ground; the thing was\r\ncoming towards me across the floor. It came slowly on, and on, and on.\r\nI stood still, speechless in the sickness of my horror. Until, on my\r\nbare feet, it touched me with slimy feelers, and my terror lest it\r\nshould creep up my naked body lent me voice, and I fell shrieking like\r\na soul in agony.\r\n\r\nIt may be that my shrieking drove it from me. At least, it went. I knew\r\nit went. And all was still. Until, on a sudden, the lamp flamed out\r\nagain, and there, lying, as before, in bed, glaring at me with his\r\nbaleful eyes, was the being whom, in my folly, or in my\r\nwisdom,--whichever it was!--I was beginning to credit with the\r\npossession of unhallowed, unlawful powers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will say that to him; those two words; they only; no more. And you\r\nwill see what you will see. But Paul Lessingham is a man of resolution.\r\nShould he still persist in interference, or seek to hinder you, you\r\nwill say those two words again. You need do no more. Twice will\r\nsuffice, I promise you.--Now go.--Draw up the blind; open the window;\r\nclimb through it. Hasten to do what I have bidden you. I wait here for\r\nyour return,--and all the way I shall be with you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VI.\r\n A SINGULAR FELONY\r\n\r\nI went to the window; I drew up the blind, unlatching the sash, I threw\r\nit open; and clad, or, rather, unclad as I was, I clambered through it\r\ninto the open air. I was not only incapable of resistance, I was\r\nincapable of distinctly formulating the desire to offer resistance.\r\nSome compelling influence moved me hither and hither, with completest\r\ndisregard of whether I would or would not.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, when I found myself without, I was conscious of a sense of\r\nexultation at having escaped from the miasmic atmosphere of that room\r\nof unholy memories. And a faint hope began to dawn within my bosom\r\nthat, as I increased the distance between myself and it, I might shake\r\noff something of the nightmare helplessness which numbed and tortured\r\nme. I lingered for a moment by the window; then stepped over the short\r\ndividing wall into the street; and then again I lingered.\r\n\r\nMy condition was one of dual personality,--while, physically, I was\r\nbound, mentally, to a considerable extent, I was free. But this measure\r\nof freedom on my mental side made my plight no better. For, among other\r\nthings, I realised what a ridiculous figure I must be cutting,\r\nbarefooted and bareheaded, abroad, at such an hour of the night, in\r\nsuch a boisterous breeze,--for I quickly discovered that the wind\r\namounted to something like a gale. Apart from all other considerations,\r\nthe notion of parading the streets in such a condition filled me with\r\nprofound disgust. And I do believe that if my tyrannical oppressor had\r\nonly permitted me to attire myself in my own garments, I should have\r\nstarted with a comparatively light heart on the felonious mission on\r\nwhich he apparently was sending me. I believe, too, that the\r\nconsciousness of the incongruity of my attire increased my sense of\r\nhelplessness, and that, had I been dressed as Englishmen are wont to\r\nbe, who take their walks abroad, he would not have found in me, on that\r\noccasion, the facile instrument which, in fact, he did.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment, in which the gravelled pathway first made itself\r\nknown to my naked feet, and the cutting wind to my naked flesh, when I\r\nthink it possible that, had I gritted my teeth, and strained my every\r\nnerve, I might have shaken myself free from the bonds which shackled\r\nme, and bade defiance to the ancient sinner who, for all I knew, was\r\npeeping at me through the window. But so depressed was I by the\r\nknowledge of the ridiculous appearance I presented that, before I could\r\ntake advantage of it the moment passed,--not to return again that night.\r\n\r\nI did catch, as it were, at its fringe, as it was flying past me,\r\nmaking a hurried movement to one side,--the first I had made, of my own\r\ninitiative, for hours. But it was too late. My tormentor,--as if,\r\nthough unseen, he saw--tightened his grip, I was whirled round, and\r\nsped hastily onwards in a direction in which I certainly had no desire\r\nof travelling.\r\n\r\nAll the way I never met a soul. I have since wondered whether in that\r\nrespect my experience was not a normal one; whether it might not have\r\nhappened to any. If so, there are streets in London, long lines of\r\nstreets, which, at a certain period of the night, in a certain sort of\r\nweather--probably the weather had something to do with it--are clean\r\ndeserted; in which there is neither foot-passenger nor vehicle,--not\r\neven a policeman. The greater part of the route along which I was\r\ndriven--I know no juster word--was one with which I had some sort of\r\nacquaintance. It led, at first, through what, I take it, was some part\r\nof Walham Green; then along the Lillie Road, through Brompton, across\r\nthe Fulham Road, through the network of streets leading to Sloane\r\nStreet, across Sloane Street into Lowndes Square. Who goes that way\r\ngoes some distance, and goes through some important thoroughfares; yet\r\nnot a creature did I see, nor, I imagine, was there a creature who saw\r\nme. As I crossed Sloane Street, I fancied that I heard the distant\r\nrumbling of a vehicle along the Knightsbridge Road, but that was the\r\nonly sound I heard.\r\n\r\nIt is painful even to recollect the plight in which I was when I was\r\nstopped,--for stopped I was, as shortly and as sharply, as the beast of\r\nburden, with a bridle in its mouth, whose driver puts a period to his\r\ncareer. I was wet,--intermittent gusts of rain were borne on the\r\nscurrying wind; in spite of the pace at which I had been brought, I was\r\nchilled to the bone; and--worst of all!--my mud-stained feet, all cut\r\nand bleeding, were so painful--for, unfortunately, I was still\r\nsusceptible enough to pain--that it was agony to have them come into\r\ncontact with the cold and the slime of the hard, unyielding pavement.\r\n\r\nI had been stopped on the opposite side of the square,--that nearest to\r\nthe hospital; in front of a house which struck me as being somewhat\r\nsmaller than the rest. It was a house with a portico; about the pillars\r\nof this portico was trelliswork, and on the trelliswork was trained\r\nsome climbing plant. As I stood, shivering, wondering what would happen\r\nnext, some strange impulse mastered me, and, immediately, to my own\r\nunbounded amazement, I found myself scrambling up the trellis towards\r\nthe verandah above. I am no gymnast, either by nature or by education;\r\nI doubt whether, previously, I had ever attempted to climb anything\r\nmore difficult than a step ladder. The result was, that, though the\r\nimpulse might be given me, the skill could not, and I had only ascended\r\na yard or so when, losing my footing, I came slithering down upon my\r\nback. Bruised and shaken though I was, I was not allowed to inquire\r\ninto my injuries. In a moment I was on my feet again, and again I was\r\nimpelled to climb,--only, however, again to come to grief. This time\r\nthe demon, or whatever it was, that had entered into me, seeming to\r\nappreciate the impossibility of getting me to the top of that verandah,\r\ndirected me to try another way. I mounted the steps leading to the\r\nfront door, got on to the low parapet which was at one side, thence on\r\nto the sill of the adjacent window,--had I slipped then I should have\r\nfallen a sheer descent of at least twenty feet to the bottom of the\r\ndeep area down below. But the sill was broad, and--if it is proper to\r\nuse such language in connection with a transaction of the sort in which\r\nI was engaged--fortune favoured me. I did not fall. In my clenched fist\r\nI had a stone. With this I struck the pane of glass, as with a hammer.\r\nThrough the hole which resulted, I could just insert my hand, and reach\r\nthe latch within. In another minute the sash was raised, and I was in\r\nthe house,--I had committed burglary.\r\n\r\nAs I look back and reflect upon the audacity of the whole proceeding,\r\neven now I tremble. Hapless slave of another\xe2\x80\x99s will although in very\r\ntruth I was, I cannot repeat too often that I realised to the full just\r\nwhat it was that I was being compelled to do--a fact which was very far\r\nfrom rendering my situation less distressful!--and every detail of my\r\ninvoluntary actions was projected upon my brain in a series of\r\npictures, whose clear-cut outlines, so long as memory endures, will\r\nnever fade. Certainly no professional burglar, nor, indeed, any\r\ncreature in his senses, would have ventured to emulate my surprising\r\nrashness. The process of smashing the pane of glass--it was plate\r\nglass--was anything but a noiseless one. There was, first, the blow\r\nitself, then the shivering of the glass, then the clattering of\r\nfragments into the area beneath. One would have thought that the whole\r\nthing would have made din enough to have roused the Seven Sleepers.\r\nBut, here, again the weather was on my side. About that time the wind\r\nwas howling wildly,--it came shrieking across the square. It is\r\npossible that the tumult which it made deadened all other sounds.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, as I stood within the room which I had violated, listening for\r\nsigns of someone being on the alert, I could hear nothing. Within the\r\nhouse there seemed to be the silence of the grave. I drew down the\r\nwindow, and made for the door.\r\n\r\nIt proved by no means easy to find. The windows were obscured by heavy\r\ncurtains, so that the room inside was dark as pitch. It appeared to be\r\nunusually full of furniture,--an appearance due, perhaps, to my being a\r\nstranger in the midst of such Cimmerian blackness. I had to feel my\r\nway, very gingerly indeed, among the various impedimenta. As it was I\r\nseemed to come into contact with most of the obstacles there were to\r\ncome into contact with, stumbling more than once over footstools, and\r\nover what seemed to be dwarf chairs. It was a miracle that my movements\r\nstill continued to be unheard,--but I believe that the explanation was,\r\nthat the house was well built; that the servants were the only persons\r\nin it at the time; that their bedrooms were on the top floor; that they\r\nwere fast asleep; and that they were little likely to be disturbed by\r\nanything that might occur in the room which I had entered.\r\n\r\nReaching the door at last, I opened it,--listening for any promise of\r\nbeing interrupted--and--to adapt a hackneyed phrase--directed by the\r\npower which shaped my end, I went across the hall and up the stairs. I\r\npassed up the first landing, and, on the second, moved to a door upon\r\nthe right. I turned the handle, it yielded, the door opened, I entered,\r\nclosing it behind me. I went to the wall just inside the door, found a\r\nhandle, jerked it, and switched on the electric light,--doing, I make\r\nno doubt, all these things, from a spectator\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, so\r\nnaturally, that a judge and jury would have been with difficulty\r\npersuaded that they were not the product of my own volition.\r\n\r\nIn the brilliant glow of the electric light I took a leisurely survey\r\nof the contents of the room. It was, as the man in the bed had said it\r\nwould be, a study,--a fine, spacious apartment, evidently intended\r\nrather for work than for show. There were three separate\r\nwriting-tables, one very large and two smaller ones, all covered with\r\nan orderly array of manuscripts and papers. A typewriter stood at the\r\nside of one. On the floor, under and about them, were piles of books,\r\nportfolios, and official-looking documents. Every available foot of\r\nwall space on three sides of the room was lined with shelves, full as\r\nthey could hold with books. On the fourth side, facing the door, was a\r\nlarge lock-up oak bookcase, and, in the farther corner, a quaint old\r\nbureau. So soon as I saw this bureau I went for it, straight as an\r\narrow from a bow,--indeed, it would be no abuse of metaphor to say that\r\nI was propelled towards it like an arrow from a bow.\r\n\r\nIt had drawers below, glass doors above, and between the drawers and\r\nthe doors was a flap to let down. It was to this flap my attention was\r\ndirected. I put out my hand to open it; it was locked at the top. I\r\npulled at it with both hands; it refused to budge.\r\n\r\nSo this was the lock I was, if necessary, to practise the arts of a\r\nthief to open. I was no picklock; I had flattered myself that nothing,\r\nand no one, could make me such a thing. Yet now that I found myself\r\nconfronted by that unyielding flap, I found that pressure, irresistible\r\npressure, was being put upon me to gain, by any and every means, access\r\nto its interior. I had no option but to yield. I looked about me in\r\nsearch of some convenient tool with which to ply the felon\xe2\x80\x99s trade. I\r\nfound it close beside me. Leaning against the wall, within a yard of\r\nwhere I stood, were examples of various kinds of weapons,--among them,\r\nspear-heads. Taking one of these spear-heads, with much difficulty I\r\nforced the point between the flap and the bureau. Using the leverage\r\nthus obtained, I attempted to prise it open. The flap held fast; the\r\nspear-head snapped in two. I tried another, with the same result; a\r\nthird, to fail again. There were no more. The most convenient thing\r\nremaining was a queer, heavy-headed, sharp-edged hatchet. This I took,\r\nbrought the sharp edge down with all my force upon the refractory flap.\r\nThe hatchet went through,--before I had done with it, it was open with\r\na vengeance.\r\n\r\nBut I was destined on the occasion of my first--and, I trust,\r\nlast--experience of the burglar\xe2\x80\x99s calling, to carry the part completely\r\nthrough. I had gained access to the flap itself only to find that at\r\nthe back were several small drawers, on one of which my observation was\r\nbrought to bear in a fashion which it was quite impossible to\r\ndisregard. As a matter of course it was locked, and, once more, I had\r\nto search for something which would serve as a rough-and-ready\r\nsubstitute for the missing key.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing at all suitable among the weapons,--I could hardly\r\nfor such a purpose use the hatchet; the drawer in question was such a\r\nlittle one that to have done so would have been to shiver it to\r\nsplinters. On the mantelshelf, in an open leather case, were a pair of\r\nrevolvers. Statesmen, nowadays, sometimes stand in actual peril of\r\ntheir lives. It is possible that Mr Lessingham, conscious of\r\ncontinually threatened danger, carried them about with him as a\r\nnecessary protection. They were serviceable weapons, large, and\r\nsomewhat weighty,--of the type with which, I believe, upon occasion the\r\npolice are armed. Not only were all the barrels loaded, but, in the\r\ncase itself there was a supply of cartridges more than sufficient to\r\ncharge them all again.\r\n\r\nI was handling the weapons, wondering--if, in my condition, the word\r\nwas applicable--what use I could make of them to enable me to gain\r\nadmission to that drawer, when there came, on a sudden, from the street\r\nwithout, the sound of approaching wheels. There was a whirring within\r\nmy brain, as if someone was endeavouring to explain to me to what\r\nservice to apply the revolvers, and I, perforce, strained every nerve\r\nto grasp the meaning of my invisible mentor. While I did so, the wheels\r\ndrew rapidly nearer, and, just as I was expecting them to go whirling\r\nby, stopped,--in front of the house. My heart leapt in my bosom. In a\r\nconvulsion of frantic terror, again, during the passage of one frenzied\r\nmoment, I all but burst the bonds that held me, and fled, haphazard,\r\nfrom the imminent peril. But the bonds were stronger than I,--it was as\r\nif I had been rooted to the ground.\r\n\r\nA key was inserted in the keyhole of the front door, the lock was\r\nturned, the door thrown open, firm footsteps entered the house. If I\r\ncould I would not have stood upon the order of my going, but gone at\r\nonce, anywhere, anyhow; but, at that moment, my comings and goings were\r\nnot matters in which I was consulted. Panic fear raging within,\r\noutwardly I was calm as possible, and stood, turning the revolvers over\r\nand over, asking myself what it could be that I was intended to do with\r\nthem. All at once it came to me in an illuminating flash,--I was to\r\nfire at the lock of the drawer, and blow it open.\r\n\r\nA madder scheme it would have been impossible to hit upon. The servants\r\nhad slept through a good deal, but they would hardly sleep through the\r\ndischarge of a revolver in a room below them,--not to speak of the\r\nperson who had just entered the premises, and whose footsteps were\r\nalready audible as he came up the stairs. I struggled to make a dumb\r\nprotest against the insensate folly which was hurrying me to infallible\r\ndestruction, without success. For me there was only obedience. With a\r\nrevolver in either hand I marched towards the bureau as unconcernedly\r\nas if I would not have given my life to have escaped the d\xc3\xa9nouement\r\nwhich I needed but a slight modicum of common sense to be aware was\r\nclose at hand. I placed the muzzle of one of the revolvers against the\r\nkeyhole of the drawer to which my unseen guide had previously directed\r\nme, and pulled the trigger. The lock was shattered, the contents of the\r\ndrawer were at my mercy. I snatched up a bundle of letters, about which\r\na pink ribbon was wrapped. Startled by a noise behind me, immediately\r\nfollowing the report of the pistol, I glanced over my shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe room door was open, and Mr Lessingham was standing with the handle\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VII.\r\n THE GREAT PAUL LESSINGHAM\r\n\r\nHe was in evening dress. He carried a small portfolio in his left hand.\r\nIf the discovery of my presence startled him, as it could scarcely have\r\nfailed to do, he allowed no sign of surprise to escape him. Paul\r\nLessingham\xe2\x80\x99s impenetrability is proverbial. Whether on platforms\r\naddressing excited crowds, or in the midst of heated discussion in the\r\nHouse of Commons, all the world knows that his coolness remains\r\nunruffled. It is generally understood that he owes his success in the\r\npolitical arena in no slight measure to the adroitness which is born of\r\nhis invulnerable presence of mind. He gave me a taste of its quality\r\nthen. Standing in the attitude which has been familiarised to us by\r\ncaricaturists, his feet apart, his broad shoulders well set back, his\r\nhandsome head a little advanced, his keen blue eyes having in them\r\nsomething suggestive of a bird of prey considering just when, where,\r\nand how to pounce, he regarded me for some seconds in perfect\r\nsilence,--whether outwardly I flinched I cannot say; inwardly I know I\r\ndid. When he spoke, it was without moving from where he stood, and in\r\nthe calm, airy tones in which he might have addressed an acquaintance\r\nwho had just dropped in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May I ask, sir, to what I am indebted for the pleasure of your\r\ncompany?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe paused, as if waiting for my answer. When none came, he put his\r\nquestion in another form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray, sir, who are you, and on whose invitation do I find you here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs I still stood speechless, motionless, meeting his glance without a\r\ntwitching of an eyebrow, nor a tremor of the hand, I imagine that he\r\nbegan to consider me with an even closer intentness than before. And\r\nthat the--to say the least of it--peculiarity of my appearance, caused\r\nhim to suspect that he was face to face with an adventure of a peculiar\r\nkind. Whether he took me for a lunatic I cannot certainly say; but,\r\nfrom his manner, I think it possible he did. He began to move towards\r\nme from across the room, addressing me with the utmost suavity and\r\ncourtesy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Be so good as to give me the revolver, and the papers you are holding\r\nin your hand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he came on, something entered into me, and forced itself from\r\nbetween my lips, so that I said, in a low, hissing voice, which I vow\r\nwas never mine,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98THE BEETLE!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhether it was, or was not, owing, in some degree, to a trick of my\r\nimagination, I cannot determine, but, as the words were spoken, it\r\nseemed to me that the lights went low, so that the place was all in\r\ndarkness, and I again was filled with the nauseous consciousness of the\r\npresence of something evil in the room. But if, in that matter, my\r\nabnormally strained imagination played me a trick, there could be no\r\ndoubt whatever as to the effect which the words had on Mr Lessingham.\r\nWhen the mist of the blackness--real or supposititious--had passed from\r\nbefore my eyes, I found that he had retreated to the extremest limits\r\nof the room, and was crouching, his back against the bookshelves,\r\nclutching at them, in the attitude of a man who has received a\r\nstaggering blow, from which, as yet, he has had no opportunity of\r\nrecovering. A most extraordinary change had taken place in the\r\nexpression of his face; in his countenance amazement, fear, and horror\r\nseemed struggling for the mastery. I was filled with a most\r\ndiscomforting qualm, as I gazed at the frightened figure in front of\r\nme, and realised that it was that of the great Paul Lessingham, the god\r\nof my political idolatry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who are you?--In God\xe2\x80\x99s name, who are you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis very voice seemed changed; his frenzied, choking accents would\r\nhardly have been recognised by either friend or foe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who are you?--Do you hear me ask, who are you? In the name of God, I\r\nbid you say!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he perceived that I was still, he began to show a species of\r\nexcitement which it was unpleasant to witness, especially as he\r\ncontinued to crouch against the bookshelf, as if he was afraid to stand\r\nup straight. So far from exhibiting the impassivity for which he was\r\nrenowned, all the muscles in his face and all the limbs in his body\r\nseemed to be in motion at once; he was like a man afflicted with the\r\nshivering ague,--his very fingers were twitching aimlessly, as they\r\nwere stretched out on either side of him, as if seeking for support\r\nfrom the shelves against which he leaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where have you come from? what do you want? who sent you here? what\r\nconcern have you with me? is it necessary that you should come and play\r\nthese childish tricks with me? why? why?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe questions came from him with astonishing rapidity. When he saw that\r\nI continued silent, they came still faster, mingled with what sounded\r\nto me like a stream of inchoate abuse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why do you stand there in that extraordinary garment,--it\xe2\x80\x99s worse than\r\nnakedness, yes, worse than nakedness! For that alone I could have you\r\npunished, and I will!--and try to play the fool? Do you think I am a\r\nboy to be bamboozled by every bogey a blunderer may try to conjure up?\r\nIf so, you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong, as whoever sent you might have had sense enough to\r\nlet you know. If you tell me who you are, and who sent you here, and\r\nwhat it is you want, I will be merciful; if not, the police shall be\r\nsent for, and the law shall take its course,--to the bitter end!--I\r\nwarn you.--Do you hear? You fool! tell me who you are?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe last words came from him in what was very like a burst of childish\r\nfury. He himself seemed conscious, the moment after, that his passion\r\nwas sadly lacking in dignity, and to be ashamed of it. He drew himself\r\nstraight up. With a pocket-handkerchief which he took from an inner\r\npocket of his coat, he wiped his lips. Then, clutching it tightly in\r\nhis hand, he eyed me with a fixedness which, under any other\r\ncircumstances, I should have found unbearable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, sir, is your continued silence part of the business of the r\xc3\xb4le\r\nyou have set yourself to play?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis tone was firmer, and his bearing more in keeping with his character.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If it be so, I presume that I, at least have liberty to speak. When I\r\nfind a gentleman, even one gifted with your eloquence of silence,\r\nplaying the part of burglar, I think you will grant that a few words on\r\nmy part cannot justly be considered to be out of place.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain he paused. I could not but feel that he was employing the vehicle\r\nof somewhat cumbrous sarcasm to gain time, and to give himself the\r\nopportunity of recovering, if the thing was possible, his pristine\r\ncourage. That, for some cause wholly hidden from me, the mysterious\r\nutterance had shaken his nature to its deepest foundations, was made\r\nplainer by his endeavour to treat the whole business with a sort of\r\ncynical levity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To commence with, may I ask if you have come through London, or\r\nthrough any portion of it, in that costume,--or, rather, in that want\r\nof costume? It would seem out of place in a Cairene street,--would it\r\nnot?--even in the Rue de Rabagas,--was it not the Rue de Rabagas?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe asked the question with an emphasis the meaning of which was wholly\r\nlost on me. What he referred to either then, or in what immediately\r\nfollowed, I, of course, knew no more than the man in the moon,--though\r\nI should probably have found great difficulty in convincing him of my\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I take it that you are a reminiscence of the Rue de Rabagas,--that, of\r\ncourse;--is it not of course? The little house with the blue-grey\r\nvenetians, and the piano with the F sharp missing? Is there still the\r\npiano? with the tinny treble,--indeed, the whole atmosphere, was it not\r\ntinny?--You agree with me?--I have not forgotten. I am not even afraid\r\nto remember,--you perceive it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA new idea seemed to strike him,--born, perhaps, of my continued\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You look English,--is it possible that you are not English? What are\r\nyou then--French? We shall see!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe addressed me in a tongue which I recognised as French, but with\r\nwhich I was not sufficiently acquainted to understand. Although, I\r\nflatter myself that,--as the present narrative should show--I have not\r\nmade an ill-use of the opportunities which I have had to improve my,\r\noriginally, modest education, I regret that I have never had so much as\r\na ghost of a chance to acquire an even rudimentary knowledge of any\r\nlanguage except my own. Recognising, I suppose, from my looks, that he\r\nwas addressing me in a tongue to which I was a stranger, after a time\r\nhe stopped, added something with a smile, and then began to talk to me\r\nin a lingo to which, in a manner of speaking, I was even stranger, for\r\nthis time I had not the faintest notion what it was,--it might have\r\nbeen gibberish for all that I could tell. Quickly perceiving that he\r\nhad succeeded no better than before, he returned to English.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You do not know French?--nor the _patois_ of the Rue de Rabagas? Very\r\ngood,--then what is it that you do know? Are you under a vow of\r\nsilence, or are you dumb,--except upon occasion? Your face is\r\nEnglish,--what can be seen of it, and I will take it, therefore, that\r\nEnglish spoken words convey some meaning to your brain. So listen, sir,\r\nto what I have to say,--do me the favour to listen carefully.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was becoming more and more his former self. In his clear, modulated\r\ntones there was a ring of something like a threat,--a something which\r\nwent very far beyond his words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know something of a period which I choose to have forgotten,--that\r\nis plain; you come from a person who, probably, knows still more. Go\r\nback to that person and say that what I have forgotten I have\r\nforgotten; nothing will be gained by anyone by an endeavour to induce\r\nme to remember,--be very sure upon that point, say that nothing will be\r\ngained by anyone. That time was one of mirage, of delusion, of disease.\r\nI was in a condition, mentally and bodily, in which pranks could have\r\nbeen played upon me by any trickster. Such pranks were played. I know\r\nthat now quite well. I do not pretend to be proficient in the _modus\r\noperandi_ of the hankey-pankey man, but I know that he has a method, all\r\nthe same,--one susceptible, too, of facile explanation. Go back to your\r\nfriend, and tell him that I am not again likely to be made the butt of\r\nhis old method,--nor of his new one either.--You hear me, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI remained motionless and silent,--an attitude which, plainly, he\r\nresented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you deaf and dumb? You certainly are not dumb, for you spoke to me\r\njust now. Be advised by me, and do not compel me to resort to measures\r\nwhich will be the cause to you of serious discomfort.--You hear me,\r\nsir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStill, from me, not a sign of comprehension,--to his increased\r\nannoyance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So be it. Keep your own counsel, if you choose. Yours will be the\r\nbitterness, not mine. You may play the lunatic, and play it excellently\r\nwell, but that you do understand what is said to you is clear.--Come to\r\nbusiness, sir. Give me that revolver, and the packet of letters which\r\nyou have stolen from my desk.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had been speaking with the air of one who desired to convince\r\nhimself as much as me,--and about his last words there was almost a\r\nflavour of braggadocio. I remained unheeding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you going to do as I require, or are you insane enough to\r\nrefuse?--in which case I shall summon assistance, and there will\r\nquickly be an end of it. Pray do not imagine that you can trick me into\r\nsupposing that you do not grasp the situation. I know better.--Once\r\nmore, are you going to give me that revolver and those letters?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYet no reply. His anger was growing momentarily greater,--and his\r\nagitation too. On my first introduction to Paul Lessingham I was not\r\ndestined to discover in him any one of those qualities of which the\r\nworld held him to be the undisputed possessor. He showed himself to be\r\nas unlike the statesman I had conceived, and esteemed, as he easily\r\ncould have done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think I stand in awe of you?--you!--of such a thing as you! Do\r\nas I tell you, or I myself will make you,--and, at the same time, teach\r\nyou a much-needed lesson.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe raised his voice. In his bearing there was a would-be defiance. He\r\nmight not have been aware of it, but the repetitions of the threats\r\nwere, in themselves, confessions of weakness. He came a step or two\r\nforward,--then, stopping short, began to tremble. The perspiration\r\nbroke out upon his brow; he made spasmodic little dabs at it with his\r\ncrumpled-up handkerchief. His eyes wandered hither and thither, as if\r\nsearching for something which they feared to see yet were constrained\r\nto seek. He began to talk to himself, out loud, in odd disconnected\r\nsentences,--apparently ignoring me entirely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What was that?--It was nothing.--It was my imagination.--My nerves are\r\nout of order.--I have been working too hard.--I am not well.--_What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthat?_\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis last inquiry came from him in a half-stifled shriek,--as the door\r\nopened to admit the head and body of an elderly man in a state of\r\nconsiderable undress. He had the tousled appearance of one who had been\r\nunexpectedly roused out of slumber, and unwillingly dragged from bed.\r\nMr Lessingham stared at him as if he had been a ghost, while he stared\r\nback at Mr Lessingham as if he found a difficulty in crediting the\r\nevidence of his own eyes. It was he who broke the\r\nsilence,--stutteringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure I beg your pardon, sir, but one of the maids thought that\r\nshe heard the sound of a shot, and we came down to see if there was\r\nanything the matter,--I had no idea, sir, that you were here.\xe2\x80\x99 His eyes\r\ntravelled from Mr Lessingham towards me,--suddenly increasing, when\r\nthey saw me, to about twice their previous size. \xe2\x80\x98God save us!--who is\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe man\xe2\x80\x99s self-evident cowardice possibly impressed Mr Lessingham with\r\nthe conviction that he himself was not cutting the most dignified of\r\nfigures. At any rate, he made a notable effort to, once more, assume a\r\nbearing of greater determination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are quite right, Matthews, quite right. I am obliged by your\r\nwatchfulness. At present you may leave the room--I propose to deal with\r\nthis fellow myself,--only remain with the other men upon the landing,\r\nso that, if I call, you may come to my assistance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMatthews did as he was told, he left the room,--with, I fancy, more\r\nrapidity than he had entered it. Mr Lessingham returned to me, his\r\nmanner distinctly more determined, as if he found his resolution\r\nreinforced by the near neighbourhood of his retainers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, my man, you see how the case stands, at a word from me you will\r\nbe overpowered and doomed to undergo a long period of imprisonment. Yet\r\nI am still willing to listen to the dictates of mercy. Put down that\r\nrevolver, give me those letters,--you will not find me disposed to\r\ntreat you hardly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor all the attention I paid him, I might have been a graven image. He\r\nmisunderstood, or pretended to misunderstand, the cause of my silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, I see that you suppose my intentions to be harsher than they\r\nreally are,--do not let us have a scandal, and a scene,--be\r\nsensible!--give me those letters!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain he moved in my direction; again, after he had taken a step or\r\ntwo, to stumble and stop, and look about him with frightened eyes;\r\nagain to begin to mumble to himself aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a conjurer\xe2\x80\x99s trick!--Of course!--Nothing more.--What else could\r\nit be?--I\xe2\x80\x99m not to be fooled.--I\xe2\x80\x99m older than I was. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\noverdoing it,--that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSuddenly he broke into cries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Matthews! Matthews!--Help! help!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMatthews entered the room, followed by three other men, younger than\r\nhimself. Evidently all had slipped into the first articles of clothing\r\nthey could lay their hands upon, and each carried a stick, or some\r\nsimilar rudimentary weapon.\r\n\r\nTheir master spurred them on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Strike the revolver out of his hand, Matthews!--knock him down!--take\r\nthe letters from him!--don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid!--I\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn proof of it, he rushed at me, as it seemed half blindly. As he did\r\nso I was constrained to shout out, in tones which I should not have\r\nrecognised as mine,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98THE BEETLE!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd that moment the room was all in darkness, and there were screams as\r\nof someone in an agony of terror or of pain. I felt that something had\r\ncome into the room, I knew not whence nor how,--something of horror.\r\nAnd the next action of which I was conscious was, that under cover of\r\nthe darkness, I was flying from the room, propelled by I knew not what.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VIII.\r\n THE MAN IN THE STREET\r\n\r\nWhether anyone pursued I cannot say. I have some dim recollection, as I\r\ncame out of the room, of women being huddled against the wall upon the\r\nlanding, and of their screaming as I went past. But whether any effort\r\nwas made to arrest my progress I cannot tell. My own impression is that\r\nnot the slightest attempt to impede my headlong flight was made by\r\nanyone.\r\n\r\nIn what direction I was going I did not know. I was like a man flying\r\nthrough the phantasmagoric happenings of a dream, knowing neither how\r\nnor whither. I tore along what I suppose was a broad passage, through a\r\ndoor at the end into what, I fancy, was a drawing-room. Across this\r\nroom I dashed, helter-skelter, bringing down, in the gloom, unseen\r\narticles of furniture, with myself sometimes on top, and sometimes\r\nunder them. In a trice, each time I fell, I was on my feet\r\nagain,--until I went crashing against a window which was concealed by\r\ncurtains. It would not have been strange had I crashed through it,--but\r\nI was spared that. Thrusting aside the curtains, I fumbled for the\r\nfastening of the window. It was a tall French casement, extending, so\r\nfar as I could judge, from floor to ceiling. When I had it open I\r\nstepped through it on to the verandah without,--to find that I was on\r\nthe top of the portico which I had vainly essayed to ascend from below.\r\n\r\nI tried the road down which I had tried up,--proceeding with a\r\nbreakneck recklessness of which now I shudder to think. It was,\r\nprobably, some thirty feet above the pavement, yet I rushed at the\r\ndescent with as much disregard for the safety of life and limb as if it\r\nhad been only three. Over the edge of the parapet I went, obtaining,\r\nwith my naked feet, a precarious foothold on the latticework,--then\r\ndown I commenced to scramble. I never did get a proper hold, and when I\r\nhad descended, perhaps, rather more than half the distance--scraping,\r\nas it seemed to me, every scrap of skin off my body in the process--I\r\nlost what little hold I had. Down to the bottom I went tumbling,\r\nrolling right across the pavement into the muddy road. It was a miracle\r\nI was not seriously injured,--but in that sense, certainly, that night\r\nthe miracles were on my side. Hardly was I down, than I was up\r\nagain,--mud and all.\r\n\r\nJust as I was getting on to my feet I felt a firm hand grip me by the\r\nshoulder. Turning I found myself confronted by a tall, slenderly built\r\nman, with a long, drooping moustache, and an overcoat buttoned up to\r\nthe chin, who held me with a grasp of steel. He looked at me,--and I\r\nlooked back at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98After the ball,--eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEven then I was struck by something pleasant in his voice, and some\r\nquality as of sunshine in his handsome face.\r\n\r\nSeeing that I said nothing he went on,--with a curious, half mocking\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that the way to come slithering down the Apostle\xe2\x80\x99s pillar?--Is it\r\nsimple burglary, or simpler murder?--Tell me the glad tidings that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve killed St Paul, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhether he was mad or not I cannot say,--there was some excuse for\r\nthinking so. He did not look mad, though his words and actions alike\r\nwere strange.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Although you have confined yourself to gentle felony, shall I not\r\nshower blessings on the head of him who has been robbing Paul?--Away\r\nwith you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe removed his grip, giving me a gentle push as he did so,--and I was\r\naway. I neither stayed nor paused.\r\n\r\nI knew little of records, but if anyone has made a better record than I\r\ndid that night between Lowndes Square and Walham Green I should like to\r\nknow just what it was,--I should, too, like to have seen it done.\r\n\r\nIn an incredibly short space of time I was once more in front of the\r\nhouse with the open window,--the packet of letters--which were like to\r\nhave cost me so dear!--gripped tightly in my hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER IX.\r\n THE CONTENTS OF THE PACKET\r\n\r\nI pulled up sharply,--as if a brake had been suddenly, and even\r\nmercilessly, applied to bring me to a standstill. In front of the\r\nwindow I stood shivering. A shower had recently commenced,--the falling\r\nrain was being blown before the breeze. I was in a terrible sweat,--yet\r\ntremulous as with cold; covered with mud; bruised, and cut, and\r\nbleeding,--as piteous an object as you would care to see. Every limb in\r\nmy body ached; every muscle was exhausted; mentally and physically I\r\nwas done; had I not been held up, willy nilly, by the spell which was\r\nupon me, I should have sunk down, then and there, in a hopeless,\r\nhelpless, hapless heap.\r\n\r\nBut my tormentor was not yet at an end with me.\r\n\r\nAs I stood there, like some broken and beaten hack, waiting for the\r\nword of command, it came. It was as if some strong magnetic current had\r\nbeen switched on to me through the window to draw me into the room.\r\nOver the low wall I went, over the sill,--once more I stood in that\r\nchamber of my humiliation and my shame. And once again I was conscious\r\nof that awful sense of the presence of an evil thing. How much of it\r\nwas fact, and how much of it was the product of imagination I cannot\r\nsay; but, looking back, it seems to me that it was as if I had been\r\ntaken out of the corporeal body to be plunged into the inner chambers\r\nof all nameless sin. There was the sound of something flopping from off\r\nthe bed on to the ground, and I knew that the thing was coming at me\r\nacross the floor. My stomach quaked, my heart melted within me,--the\r\nvery anguish of my terror gave me strength to scream,--and scream!\r\nSometimes, even now, I seem to hear those screams of mine ringing\r\nthrough the night, and I bury my face in the pillow, and it is as\r\nthough I was passing through the very Valley of the Shadow.\r\n\r\nThe thing went back,--I could hear it slipping and sliding across the\r\nfloor. There was silence. And, presently, the lamp was lit, and the\r\nroom was all in brightness. There, on the bed, in the familiar attitude\r\nbetween the sheets, his head resting on his hand, his eyes blazing like\r\nliving coals, was the dreadful cause of all my agonies. He looked at me\r\nwith his unpitying, unblinking glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So!--Through the window again!--like a thief!--Is it always through\r\nthat door that you come into a house?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe paused,--as if to give me time to digest his gibe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You saw Paul Lessingham,--well?--the great Paul Lessingham!--Was he,\r\nthen, so great?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis rasping voice, with its queer foreign twang, reminded me, in some\r\nuncomfortable way, of a rusty saw,--the things he said, and the manner\r\nin which he said them, were alike intended to add to my discomfort. It\r\nwas solely because the feat was barely possible that he only partially\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Like a thief you went into his house,--did I not tell you that you\r\nwould? Like a thief he found you,--were you not ashamed? Since, like a\r\nthief he found you, how comes it that you have escaped,--by what\r\nrobber\xe2\x80\x99s artifice have you saved yourself from gaol?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis manner changed,--so that, all at once, he seemed to snarl at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is he great?--well!--is he great,--Paul Lessingham? You are small, but\r\nhe is smaller,--your great Paul Lessingham!--Was there ever a man so\r\nless than nothing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith the recollection fresh upon me of Mr Lessingham as I had so lately\r\nseen him I could not but feel that there might be a modicum of truth in\r\nwhat, with such an intensity of bitterness, the speaker suggested. The\r\npicture which, in my mental gallery, I had hung in the place of honour,\r\nseemed, to say the least, to have become a trifle smudged.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the man in the bed seemed to experience not the slightest\r\ndifficulty in deciphering what was passing through my mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is so,--you and he, you are a pair,--the great Paul Lessingham is\r\nas great a thief as you,--and greater!--for, at least, than you he has\r\nmore courage.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor some moments he was still; then exclaimed, with sudden fierceness,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give me what you have stolen!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI moved towards the bed--most unwillingly--and held out to him the\r\npacket of letters which I had abstracted from the little drawer.\r\nPerceiving my disinclination to his near neighbourhood, he set himself\r\nto play with it. Ignoring my outstretched hand, he stared me straight\r\nin the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What ails you? Are you not well? Is it not sweet to stand close at my\r\nside? You, with your white skin, if I were a woman, would you not take\r\nme for a wife?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was something about the manner in which this was said which was\r\nso essentially feminine that once more I wondered if I could possibly\r\nbe mistaken in the creature\xe2\x80\x99s sex. I would have given much to have been\r\nable to strike him across the face,--or, better, to have taken him by\r\nthe neck, and thrown him through the window, and rolled him in the mud.\r\n\r\nHe condescended to notice what I was holding out to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So!--that is what you have stolen!--That is what you have taken from\r\nthe drawer in the bureau--the drawer which was locked--and which you\r\nused the arts in which a thief is skilled to enter. Give it to\r\nme,--thief!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe snatched the packet from me, scratching the back of my hand as he\r\ndid so, as if his nails had been talons. He turned the packet over and\r\nover, glaring at it as he did so,--it was strange what a relief it was\r\nto have his glance removed from off my face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You kept it in your inner drawer, Paul Lessingham, where none but you\r\ncould see it,--did you? You hid it as one hides treasure. There should\r\nbe something here worth having, worth seeing, worth knowing,--yes,\r\nworth knowing!--since you found it worth your while to hide it up so\r\nclosely.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs I have said, the packet was bound about by a string of pink\r\nribbon,--a fact on which he presently began to comment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With what a pretty string you have encircled it,--and how neatly it is\r\ntied! Surely only a woman\xe2\x80\x99s hand could tie a knot like that,--who would\r\nhave guessed yours were such agile fingers?--So! An endorsement on the\r\ncover! What\xe2\x80\x99s this?--let\xe2\x80\x99s see what\xe2\x80\x99s written!--\xe2\x80\x9cThe letters of my dear\r\nlove, Marjorie Lindon.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he read these words, which, as he said, were endorsed upon the outer\r\nsheet of paper which served as a cover for the letters which were\r\nenclosed within, his face became transfigured. Never did I suppose that\r\nrage could have so possessed a human countenance. His jaw dropped open\r\nso that his yellow fangs gleamed through his parted lips,--he held his\r\nbreath so long that each moment I looked to see him fall down in a fit;\r\nthe veins stood out all over his face and head like seams of blood. I\r\nknow not how long he continued speechless. When his breath returned, it\r\nwas with chokings and gaspings, in the midst of which he hissed out his\r\nwords, as if their mere passage through his throat brought him near to\r\nstrangulation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The letters of his dear love!--of his dear love!--his!--Paul\r\nLessingham\xe2\x80\x99s!--So!--It is as I guessed,--as I knew,--as I\r\nsaw!--Marjorie Lindon!--Sweet Marjorie!--His dear love!--Paul\r\nLessingham\xe2\x80\x99s dear love!--She with the lily face, the corn-hued\r\nhair!--What is it his dear love has found in her fond heart to write\r\nPaul Lessingham?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSitting up in bed he tore the packet open. It contained, perhaps, eight\r\nor nine letters,--some mere notes, some long epistles. But, short or\r\nlong, he devoured them with equal appetite, each one over and over\r\nagain, till I thought he never would have done re-reading them. They\r\nwere on thick white paper, of a peculiar shade of whiteness, with\r\nuntrimmed edges. On each sheet a crest and an address were stamped in\r\ngold, and all the sheets were of the same shape and size. I told myself\r\nthat if anywhere, at any time, I saw writing paper like that again, I\r\nshould not fail to know it. The caligraphy was, like the paper,\r\nunusual, bold, decided, and, I should have guessed, produced by a J pen.\r\n\r\nAll the time that he was reading he kept emitting sounds, more\r\nresembling yelps and snarls than anything more human,--like some savage\r\nbeast nursing its pent-up rage. When he had made an end of\r\nreading,--for the season,--he let his passion have full vent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So!--That is what his dear love has found it in her heart to write\r\nPaul Lessingham!--Paul Lessingham!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPen cannot describe the concentrated frenzy of hatred with which the\r\nspeaker dwelt upon the name,--it was demoniac.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is enough!--it is the end!--it is his doom! He shall be ground\r\nbetween the upper and the nether stones in the towers of anguish, and\r\nall that is left of him shall be cast on the accursed stream of the\r\nbitter waters, to stink under the blood-grimed sun! And for her--for\r\nMarjorie Lindon!--for his dear love!--it shall come to pass that she\r\nshall wish that she was never born,--nor he!--and the gods of the\r\nshadows shall smell the sweet incense of her suffering!--It shall be!\r\nit shall be! It is I that say it,--even I!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn the madness of his rhapsodical frenzy I believe that he had actually\r\nforgotten I was there. But, on a sudden, glancing aside, he saw me, and\r\nremembered,--and was prompt to take advantage of an opportunity to\r\nwreak his rage upon a tangible object.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is you!--you thief!--you still live!--to make a mock of one of the\r\nchildren of the gods!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe leaped, shrieking, off the bed, and sprang at me, clasping my throat\r\nwith his horrid hands, bearing me backwards on to the floor; I felt his\r\nbreath mingle with mine * * * and then God, in His mercy, sent oblivion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n BOOK II.\r\n The Haunted Man\r\n\r\n _The Story according to Sydney Atherton, Esquire_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER X.\r\n REJECTED\r\n\r\nIt was after our second waltz I did it. In the usual quiet\r\ncorner,--which, that time, was in the shadow of a palm in the hall.\r\nBefore I had got into my stride she checked me,--touching my sleeve\r\nwith her fan, turning towards me with startled eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop, please!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut I was not to be stopped. Cliff Challoner passed, with Gerty Cazell.\r\nI fancy that, as he passed, he nodded. I did not care. I was wound up\r\nto go, and I went it. No man knows how he can talk till he does\r\ntalk,--to the girl he wants to marry. It is my impression that I gave\r\nher recollections of the Restoration poets. She seemed surprised,--not\r\nhaving previously detected in me the poetic strain, and insisted on\r\ncutting in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Atherton, I am so sorry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen I did let fly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sorry that I love you!--why? Why should you be sorry that you have\r\nbecome the one thing needful in any man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes,--even in mine? The one\r\nthing precious,--the one thing to be altogether esteemed! Is it so\r\ncommon for a woman to come across a man who would be willing to lay\r\ndown his life for her that she should be sorry when she finds him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did not know that you felt like this, though I confess that I have\r\nhad my--my doubts.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Doubts!--I thank you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are quite aware, Mr Atherton, that I like you very much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Like me!--Bah!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot help liking you,--though it may be \xe2\x80\x9cbah.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to like me,--I want you to love me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Precisely,--that is your mistake.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My mistake!--in wanting you to love me!--when I love you--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,--though I can\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking that you are\r\nmistaken even there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mistaken!--in supposing that I love you!--when I assert and reassert\r\nit with the whole force of my being! What do you want me to do to prove\r\nI love you,--take you in my arms and crush you to my bosom, and make a\r\nspectacle of you before every creature in the place?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99d rather you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, and perhaps you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind not talking\r\nquite so loud. Mr Challoner seems to be wondering what you\xe2\x80\x99re shouting\r\nabout.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t torture me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe opened and shut her fan,--as she looked down at it I am disposed to\r\nsuspect that she smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad we have had this little explanation, because, of course, you\r\nare my friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not your friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me, you are.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say I\xe2\x80\x99m not,--if I can\xe2\x80\x99t be something else, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be no friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe went on,--calmly ignoring me,--playing with her fan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As it happens, I am, just now, in rather a delicate position, in which\r\na friend is welcome.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter? Who\xe2\x80\x99s been worrying you,--your father?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,--he has not,--as yet; but he may be soon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s in the wind?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Lessingham.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe dropped her voice,--and her eyes. For the moment I did not catch\r\nher meaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your friend, Mr Lessingham.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Excuse me, Miss Lindon, but I am by no means sure that anyone is\r\nentitled to call Mr Lessingham a friend of mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What!--Not when I am going to be his wife?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat took me aback. I had had my suspicions that Paul Lessingham was\r\nmore with Marjorie than he had any right to be, but I had never\r\nsupposed that she could see anything desirable in a stick of a man like\r\nthat. Not to speak of a hundred and one other\r\nconsiderations,--Lessingham on one side of the House, and her father on\r\nthe other; and old Lindon girding at him anywhere and everywhere--with\r\nhis high-dried Tory notions of his family importance,--to say nothing\r\nof his fortune.\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I looked what I felt,--if I did, I looked uncommonly\r\nblank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have chosen an appropriate moment, Miss Lindon, to make to me such\r\na communication.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe chose to disregard my irony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad you think so, because now you will understand what a\r\ndifficult position I am in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I offer you my hearty congratulations.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I thank you for them, Mr Atherton, in the spirit in which they are\r\noffered, because from you I know they mean so much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI bit my lip,--for the life of me I could not tell how she wished me to\r\nread her words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do I understand that this announcement has been made to me as one of\r\nthe public?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You do not. It is made to you, in confidence, as my friend,--as my\r\ngreatest friend; because a husband is something more than friend.\xe2\x80\x99 My\r\npulses tingled. \xe2\x80\x98You will be on my side?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe had paused,--and I stayed silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On your side,--or Mr Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His side is my side, and my side is his side;--you will be on our\r\nside?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not sure that I altogether follow you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are the first I have told. When papa hears it is possible that\r\nthere will be trouble,--as you know. He thinks so much of you and of\r\nyour opinion; when that trouble comes I want you to be on our side,--on\r\nmy side.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why should I?--what does it matter? You are stronger than your\r\nfather,--it is just possible that Lessingham is stronger than you;\r\ntogether, from your father\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, you will be invincible.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are my friend,--are you not my friend?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In effect, you offer me an Apple of Sodom.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you;--I did not think you so unkind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you,--are you kind? I make you an avowal of my love, and,\r\nstraightway, you ask me to act as chorus to the love of another.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How could I tell you loved me,--as you say! I had no notion. You have\r\nknown me all your life, yet you have not breathed a word of it till\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I had spoken before?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI imagine that there was a slight movement of her shoulders,--almost\r\namounting to a shrug.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not know that it would have made any difference.--I do not\r\npretend that it would. But I do know this, I believe that you yourself\r\nhave only discovered the state of your own mind within the last\r\nhalf-hour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIf she had slapped my face she could not have startled me more. I had\r\nno notion if her words were uttered at random, but they came so near\r\nthe truth they held me breathless. It was a fact that only during the\r\nlast few minutes had I really realised how things were with me,--only\r\nsince the end of that first waltz that the flame had burst out in my\r\nsoul which was now consuming me. She had read me by what seemed so like\r\na flash of inspiration that I hardly knew what to say to her. I tried\r\nto be stinging.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You flatter me, Miss Lindon, you flatter me at every point. Had you\r\nonly discovered to me the state of your mind a little sooner I should\r\nnot have discovered to you the state of mine at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We will consider it _terra incognita_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Since you wish it.\xe2\x80\x99 Her provoking calmness stung me,--and the\r\nsuspicion that she was laughing at me in her sleeve. I gave her a\r\nglimpse of the cloven hoof. \xe2\x80\x98But, at the same time, since you assert\r\nthat you have so long been innocent, I beg that you will continue so no\r\nmore. At least, your innocence shall be without excuse. For I wish you\r\nto understand that I love you, that I have loved you, that I shall love\r\nyou. Any understanding you may have with Mr Lessingham will not make\r\nthe slightest difference. I warn you, Miss Lindon, that, until death,\r\nyou will have to write me down your lover.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe looked at me, with wide open eyes,--as if I almost frightened her.\r\nTo be frank, that was what I wished to do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Atherton!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Lindon?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is not like you at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We seem to be making each other\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance for the first time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe continued to gaze at me with her big eyes,--which, to be candid, I\r\nfound it difficult to meet. On a sudden her face was lighted by a\r\nsmile,--which I resented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not after all these years,--not after all these years! I know you, and\r\nthough I daresay you\xe2\x80\x99re not flawless, I fancy you\xe2\x80\x99ll be found to ring\r\npretty true.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer manner was almost sisterly,--elder-sisterly. I could have shaken\r\nher. Hartridge coming to claim his dance gave me an opportunity to\r\nescape with such remnants of dignity as I could gather about me. He\r\ndawdled up,--his thumbs, as usual, in his waistcoat pockets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe, Miss Lindon, this is our dance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe acknowledged it with a bow, and rose to take his arm. I got up, and\r\nleft her, without a word.\r\n\r\nAs I crossed the hall I chanced on Percy Woodville. He was in his\r\nfamiliar state of fluster, and was gaping about him as if he had\r\nmislaid the Koh-i-noor, and wondered where in thunder it had got to.\r\nWhen he saw it was I he caught me by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say, Atherton, have you seen Miss Lindon?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No!--Have you?--By Jove!--Where? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking for her all over\r\nthe place, except in the cellars and the attics,--and I was just going\r\nto commence on them. This is our dance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In that case, she\xe2\x80\x99s shunted you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No!--Impossible!\xe2\x80\x99 His mouth went like an O,--and his eyes ditto, his\r\neyeglass clattering down on to his shirt front. \xe2\x80\x98I expect the mistake\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmine. Fact is, I\xe2\x80\x99ve made a mess of my programme. It\xe2\x80\x99s either the last\r\ndance, or this dance, or the next, that I\xe2\x80\x99ve booked with her, but I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nhanged if I know which. Just take a squint at it, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good chap,\r\nand tell me which one you think it is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI \xe2\x80\x98took a squint\xe2\x80\x99--since he held the thing within an inch of my nose I\r\ncould hardly help it; one \xe2\x80\x98squint,\xe2\x80\x99 and that was enough--and more. Some\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x99s ball programmes are studies in impressionism, Percy\xe2\x80\x99s seemed to\r\nme to be a study in madness. It was covered with hieroglyphics, but\r\nwhat they meant, or what they did there anyhow, it was absurd to\r\nsuppose that I could tell,--I never put them there!--Proverbially, the\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s a champion hasher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I regret, my dear Percy, that I am not an expert in cuneiform writing.\r\nIf you have any doubt as to which dance is yours, you\xe2\x80\x99d better ask the\r\nlady,--she\xe2\x80\x99ll feel flattered.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLeaving him to do his own addling I went to find my coat,--I panted to\r\nget into the open air; as for dancing I felt that I loathed it. Just as\r\nI neared the cloak-room someone stopped me. It was Dora Grayling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you forgotten that this is our dance?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI had forgotten,--clean. And I was not obliged by her remembering.\r\nThough as I looked at her sweet, grey eyes, and at the soft contours of\r\nher gentle face, I felt that I deserved well kicking. She is an\r\nangel,--one of the best!--but I was in no mood for angels. Not for a\r\nvery great deal would I have gone through that dance just then, nor,\r\nwith Dora Grayling, of all women in the world, would I have sat it\r\nout.--So I was a brute and blundered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must forgive me, Miss Grayling, but--I am not feeling very well,\r\nand--I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m up to any more dancing.--Good-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XI.\r\n A MIDNIGHT EPISODE\r\n\r\nThe weather out of doors was in tune with my frame of mind,--I was in a\r\ndeuce of a temper, and it was a deuce of a night. A keen north-east\r\nwind, warranted to take the skin right off you, was playing\r\ncatch-who-catch-can with intermittent gusts of blinding rain. Since it\r\nwas not fit for a dog to walk, none of your cabs for me,--nothing would\r\nserve but pedestrian exercise.\r\n\r\nSo I had it.\r\n\r\nI went down Park Lane,--and the wind and rain went with me,--also,\r\nthoughts of Dora Grayling. What a bounder I had been,--and was! If\r\nthere is anything in worse taste than to book a lady for a dance, and\r\nthen to leave her in the lurch, I should like to know what that thing\r\nis,--when found it ought to be made a note of. If any man of my\r\nacquaintance allowed himself to be guilty of such a felony in the first\r\ndegree, I should cut him. I wished someone would try to cut me,--I\r\nshould like to see him at it.\r\n\r\nIt was all Marjorie\xe2\x80\x99s fault,--everything! past, present, and to come! I\r\nhad known that girl when she was in long frocks--I had, at that period\r\nof our acquaintance, pretty recently got out of them; when she was\r\nadvanced to short ones; and when, once more, she returned to long. And\r\nall that time,--well, I was nearly persuaded that the whole of the time\r\nI had loved her. If I had not mentioned it, it was because I had\r\nsuffered my affection, \xe2\x80\x98like the worm, to lie hidden in the bud,\xe2\x80\x99--or\r\nwhatever it is the fellow says.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I was perfectly positive that if I had had the faintest\r\nnotion that she would ever seriously consider such a man as Lessingham\r\nI should have loved her long ago. Lessingham! Why, he was old enough to\r\nbe her father,--at least he was a good many years older than I was. And\r\na wretched Radical! It is true that on certain points I, also, am what\r\nsome people would call a Radical,--but not a Radical of the kind he is.\r\nThank Heaven, no! No doubt I have admired traits in his character,\r\nuntil I learnt this thing of him. I am even prepared to admit that he\r\nis a man of ability,--in his way! which is, emphatically, not mine. But\r\nto think of him in connection with such a girl as Marjorie\r\nLindon,--preposterous! Why, the man\xe2\x80\x99s as dry as a stick,--drier! And\r\ncold as an iceberg. Nothing but a politician, absolutely. He a\r\nlover!--how I could fancy such a stroke of humour setting all the\r\nbenches in a roar. Both by education, and by nature, he was incapable\r\nof even playing such a part; as for being the thing,--absurd! If you\r\nwere to sink a shaft from the crown of his head to the soles of his\r\nfeet, you would find inside him nothing but the dry bones of parties\r\nand of politics.\r\n\r\nWhat my Marjorie--if everyone had his own, she is mine, and, in that\r\nsense, she always will be mine--what my Marjorie could see in such a\r\ndry-as-dust out of which even to construct the rudiments of a husband\r\nwas beyond my fathoming.\r\n\r\nSuchlike agreeable reflections were fit company for the wind and the\r\nwet, so they bore me company all down the lane. I crossed at the\r\ncorner, going round the hospital towards the square. This brought me to\r\nthe abiding-place of Paul the Apostle. Like the idiot I was, I went out\r\ninto the middle of the street, and stood awhile in the mud to curse him\r\nand his house,--on the whole, when one considers that that is the kind\r\nof man I can be, it is, perhaps, not surprising that Marjorie disdained\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May your following,\xe2\x80\x99 I cried,--it is an absolute fact that the words\r\nwere shouted!--\xe2\x80\x98both in the House and out of it, no longer regard you\r\nas a leader! May your party follow after other gods! May your political\r\naspirations wither, and your speeches be listened to by empty benches!\r\nMay the Speaker persistently and strenuously refuse to allow you to\r\ncatch his eye, and, at the next election, may your constituency reject\r\nyou!--Jehoram!--what\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI might well ask. Until that moment I had appeared to be the only\r\nlunatic at large, either outside the house or in it, but, on a sudden,\r\na second lunatic came on the scene, and that with a vengeance. A window\r\nwas crashed open from within,--the one over the front door, and someone\r\ncame plunging through it on to the top of the portico. That it was a\r\ncase of intended suicide I made sure,--and I began to be in hopes that\r\nI was about to witness the suicide of Paul. But I was not so assured of\r\nthe intention when the individual in question began to scramble down\r\nthe pillar of the porch in the most extraordinary fashion I ever\r\nwitnessed,--I was not even convinced of a suicidal purpose when he came\r\ntumbling down, and lay sprawling in the mud at my feet.\r\n\r\nI fancy, if I had performed that portion of the act I should have lain\r\nquiet for a second or two, to consider whereabouts I was, and which end\r\nof me was uppermost. But there was no nonsense of that sort about that\r\nsingularly agile stranger,--if he was not made of indiarubber he ought\r\nto have been. So to speak, before he was down he was up,--it was all I\r\ncould do to grab at him before he was off like a rocket.\r\n\r\nSuch a figure as he presented is seldom seen,--at least, in the streets\r\nof London. What he had done with the rest of his apparel I am not in a\r\nposition to say,--all that was left of it was a long, dark cloak which\r\nhe strove to wrap round him. Save for that,--and mud!--he was bare as\r\nthe palm of my hand. Yet it was his face that held me. In my time I\r\nhave seen strange expressions on men\xe2\x80\x99s faces, but never before one such\r\nas I saw on his. He looked like a man might look who, after living a\r\nlife of undiluted crime, at last finds himself face to face with the\r\ndevil. It was not the look of a madman,--far from it; it was something\r\nworse.\r\n\r\nIt was the expression on the man\xe2\x80\x99s countenance, as much as anything\r\nelse, which made me behave as I did. I said something to him,--some\r\nnonsense, I know not what. He regarded me with a silence which was\r\nsupernatural. I spoke to him again;--not a word issued from those rigid\r\nlips; there was not a tremor of those awful eyes,--eyes which I was\r\ntolerably convinced saw something which I had never seen, or ever\r\nshould. Then I took my hand from off his shoulder, and let him go. I\r\nknow not why,--I did.\r\n\r\nHe had remained as motionless as a statue while I held him,--indeed,\r\nfor any evidence of life he gave, he might have been a statue; but,\r\nwhen my grasp was loosed, how he ran! He had turned the corner and was\r\nout of sight before I could say, \xe2\x80\x98How do!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was only then,--when he had gone, and I had realised the\r\nextra-double-express-flash-of-lightning rate at which he had taken his\r\ndeparture--that it occurred to me of what an extremely sensible act I\r\nhad been guilty in letting him go at all. Here was an individual who\r\nhad been committing burglary, or something very like it, in the house\r\nof a budding cabinet minister, and who had tumbled plump into my arms,\r\nso that all I had to do was to call a policeman and get him\r\nquodded,--and all that I had done was something of a totally different\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a nice type of an ideal citizen!\xe2\x80\x99 I was addressing myself. \xe2\x80\x98A\r\nfirst chop specimen of a low-down idiot,--to connive at the escape of\r\nthe robber who\xe2\x80\x99s been robbing Paul. Since you\xe2\x80\x99ve let the villain go,\r\nthe least you can do is to leave a card on the Apostle, and inquire how\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s feeling.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI went to Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s front door and knocked,--I knocked once, I\r\nknocked twice, I knocked thrice, and the third time, I give you my\r\nword, I made the echoes ring,--but still there was not a soul that\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If this is a case of a seven or seventy-fold murder, and the gentleman\r\nin the cloak has made a fair clearance of every living creature the\r\nhouse contains, perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s just as well I\xe2\x80\x99ve chanced upon the\r\nscene,--still I do think that one of the corpses might get up to answer\r\nthe door. If it is possible to make noise enough to waken the dead, you\r\nbet I\xe2\x80\x99m on to it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd I was,--I punished that knocker! until I warrant the pounding I\r\ngave it was audible on the other side of Green Park. And, at last, I\r\nwoke the dead,--or, rather, I roused Matthews to a consciousness that\r\nsomething was going on. Opening the door about six inches, through the\r\ninterstice he protruded his ancient nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing, my dear sir, nothing and no one. It must have been your\r\nvigorous imagination which induced you to suppose that there was,--you\r\nlet it run away with you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he knew me,--and opened the door about two feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s you, Mr Atherton. I beg your pardon, sir,--I thought it might\r\nhave been the police.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What then? Do you stand in terror of the minions of the law,--at last?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA most discreet servant, Matthews,--just the fellow for a budding\r\ncabinet minister. He glanced over his shoulder,--I had suspected the\r\npresence of a colleague at his back, now I was assured. He put his hand\r\nup to his mouth,--and I thought how exceedingly discreet he looked, in\r\nhis trousers and his stockinged feet, and with his hair all rumpled,\r\nand his braces dangling behind, and his nightshirt creased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, sir, I have received instructions not to admit the police.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The deuce you have!--From whom?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCoughing behind his hand, leaning forward, he addressed me with an air\r\nwhich was flatteringly confidential.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98From Mr Lessingham, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Possibly Mr Lessingham is not aware that a robbery has been committed\r\non his premises, that the burglar has just come out of his drawing-room\r\nwindow with a hop, skip, and a jump, bounded out of the window like a\r\ntennis-ball, flashed round the corner like a rocket.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain Matthews glanced over his shoulder, as if not clear which way\r\ndiscretion lay, whether fore or aft.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, sir. I believe that Mr Lessingham is aware of something of\r\nthe kind.\xe2\x80\x99 He seemed to come to a sudden resolution, dropping his voice\r\nto a whisper. \xe2\x80\x98The fact is, sir, that I fancy Mr Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s a good\r\ndeal upset.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upset?\xe2\x80\x99 I stared at him. There was something in his manner I did not\r\nunderstand. \xe2\x80\x98What do you mean by upset? Has the scoundrel attempted\r\nviolence?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe voice was Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s, calling to Matthews from the staircase,\r\nthough, for an instant, I hardly recognised it, it was so curiously\r\npetulant. Pushing past Matthews, I stepped into the hall. A young man,\r\nI suppose a footman, in the same undress as Matthews, was holding a\r\ncandle,--it seemed the only light about the place. By its glimmer I\r\nperceived Lessingham standing half-way up the stairs. He was in full\r\nwar paint,--as he is not the sort of man who dresses for the House, I\r\ntook it that he had been mixing pleasure with business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s I, Lessingham,--Atherton. Do you know that a fellow has jumped\r\nout of your drawing-room window?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was a second or two before he answered. When he did, his voice had\r\nlost its petulance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has he escaped?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Clean,--he\xe2\x80\x99s a mile away by now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that in his tone, when he spoke again, there was a note\r\nof relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wondered if he had. Poor fellow! more sinned against than sinning!\r\nTake my advice, Atherton, and keep out of politics. They bring you into\r\ncontact with all the lunatics at large. Good night! I am much obliged\r\nto you for knocking us up. Matthews, shut the door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTolerably cool, on my honour,--a man who brings news big with the fate\r\nof Rome does not expect to receive such treatment. He expects to be\r\nlistened to with deference, and to hear all that there is to hear, and\r\nnot to be sent to the right-about before he has had a chance of really\r\nopening his lips. Before I knew it--almost!--the door was shut, and I\r\nwas on the doorstep. Confound the Apostle\xe2\x80\x99s impudence! next time he\r\nmight have his house burnt down--and him in it!--before I took the\r\ntrouble to touch his dirty knocker.\r\n\r\nWhat did he mean by his allusion to lunatics in politics,--did he think\r\nto fool me? There was more in the business than met the eye,--and a\r\ngood deal more than he wished to meet mine,--hence his insolence. The\r\ncreature.\r\n\r\nWhat Marjorie Lindon could see in such an opusculum surpassed my\r\ncomprehension; especially when there was a man of my sort walking\r\nabout, who adored the very ground she trod upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XII.\r\n A MORNING VISITOR\r\n\r\nAll through the night, waking and sleeping, and in my dreams, I\r\nwondered what Marjorie could see in him! In those same dreams I\r\nsatisfied myself that she could, and did, see nothing in him, but\r\neverything in me,--oh the comfort! The misfortune was that when I awoke\r\nI knew it was the other way round,--so that it was a sad awakening. An\r\nawakening to thoughts of murder.\r\n\r\nSo, swallowing a mouthful and a peg, I went into my laboratory to plan\r\nmurder--legalised murder--on the biggest scale it ever has been\r\nplanned. I was on the track of a weapon which would make war not only\r\nan affair of a single campaign, but of a single half-hour. It would not\r\nwant an army to work it either. Once let an individual, or two or three\r\nat most, in possession of my weapon-that-was-to-be, get within a mile\r\nor so of even the largest body of disciplined troops that ever yet a\r\nnation put into the field, and--pouf!--in about the time it takes you\r\nto say that they would be all dead men. If weapons of precision, which\r\nmay be relied upon to slay, are preservers of the peace--and the man is\r\na fool who says that they are not!--then I was within reach of the\r\nfinest preserver of the peace imagination ever yet conceived.\r\n\r\nWhat a sublime thought to think that in the hollow of your own hand\r\nlies the life and death of nations,--and it was almost in mine.\r\n\r\nI had in front of me some of the finest destructive agents you could\r\nwish to light upon--carbon-monoxide, chlorine-trioxide, mercuric-oxide,\r\nconine, potassamide, potassium-carboxide, cyanogen--when Edwards\r\nentered. I was wearing a mask of my own invention, a thing that covered\r\nears and head and everything, something like a diver\xe2\x80\x99s helmet--I was\r\ndealing with gases a sniff of which meant death; only a few days\r\nbefore, unmasked, I had been doing some fool\xe2\x80\x99s trick with a couple of\r\nacids--sulphuric and cyanide of potassium--when, somehow, my hand\r\nslipped, and, before I knew it, minute portions of them combined. By\r\nthe mercy of Providence I fell backwards instead of forwards;--sequel,\r\nabout an hour afterwards Edwards found me on the floor, and it took the\r\nremainder of that day, and most of the doctors in town, to bring me\r\nback to life again.\r\n\r\nEdwards announced his presence by touching me on the shoulder,--when I\r\nam wearing that mask it isn\xe2\x80\x99t always easy to make me hear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Someone wishes to see you, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then tell someone that I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to see him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWell-trained servant, Edwards,--he walked off with the message as\r\ndecorously as you please. And then I thought there was an end,--but\r\nthere wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nI was regulating the valve of a cylinder in which I was fusing some\r\noxides when, once more, someone touched me on the shoulder. Without\r\nturning I took it for granted it was Edwards back again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have only to give a tiny twist to this tap, my good fellow, and you\r\nwill be in the land where the bogies bloom. Why will you come where\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re not wanted?\xe2\x80\x99 Then I looked round. \xe2\x80\x98Who the devil are you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor it was not Edwards at all, but quite a different class of character.\r\n\r\nI found myself confronting an individual who might almost have sat for\r\none of the bogies I had just alluded to. His costume was reminiscent of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98Algerians\xe2\x80\x99 whom one finds all over France, and who are the most\r\npersistent, insolent and amusing of pedlars. I remember one who used to\r\nhaunt the _r\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9titions_ at the Alcazar at Tours,--but there! This\r\nindividual was like the originals, yet unlike,--he was less gaudy, and\r\na good deal dingier, than his Gallic prototypes are apt to be. Then he\r\nwore a burnoose,--the yellow, grimy-looking article of the Arab of the\r\nSoudan, not the spick and span Arab of the boulevard. Chief difference\r\nof all, his face was clean shaven,--and whoever saw an Algerian of\r\nParis whose chiefest glory was not his well-trimmed moustache and beard?\r\n\r\nI expected that he would address me in the lingo which these gentlemen\r\ncall French,--but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are Mr Atherton?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you are Mr--Who?--how did you come here? Where\xe2\x80\x99s my servant?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe fellow held up his hand. As he did so, as if in accordance with a\r\npre-arranged signal, Edwards came into the room looking excessively\r\nstartled. I turned to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is this the person who wished to see me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you to say that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t wish to see him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you do as I told you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then how comes he here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really, sir,\xe2\x80\x99--Edwards put his hand up to his head as if he was half\r\nasleep--\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean by you don\xe2\x80\x99t know? Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you stop him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think, sir, that I must have had a touch of sudden faintness,\r\nbecause I tried to put out my hand to stop him, and--I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re an idiot.--Go!\xe2\x80\x99 And he went. I turned to the stranger. \xe2\x80\x98Pray,\r\nsir, are you a magician?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe replied to my question with another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You, Mr Atherton,--are you also a magician?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was staring at my mask with an evident lack of comprehension.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wear this because, in this place, death lurks in so many subtle\r\nforms, that, without it, I dare not breathe.\xe2\x80\x99 He inclined his\r\nhead,--though I doubt if he understood. \xe2\x80\x98Be so good as to tell me,\r\nbriefly, what it is you wish with me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe slipped his hand into the folds of his burnoose, and, taking out a\r\nslip of paper, laid it on the shelf by which we were standing. I\r\nglanced at it, expecting to find on it a petition, or a testimonial, or\r\na true statement of his sad case; instead it contained two words\r\nonly,--\xe2\x80\x98Marjorie Lindon.\xe2\x80\x99 The unlooked-for sight of that well-loved\r\nname brought the blood into my cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You come from Miss Lindon?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe narrowed his shoulders, brought his finger-tips together, inclined\r\nhis head, in a fashion which was peculiarly Oriental, but not\r\nparticularly explanatory,--so I repeated my question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you wish me to understand that you do come from Miss Lindon?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain he slipped his hand into his burnoose, again he produced a slip\r\nof paper, again he laid it on the shelf, again I glanced at it, again\r\nnothing was written on it but a name,--\xe2\x80\x98Paul Lessingham.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?--I see,--Paul Lessingham.--What then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is good,--he is bad,--is it not so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe touched first one scrap of paper, then the other. I stared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray how do you happen to know?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He shall never have her,--eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What on earth do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!--what do I mean!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Precisely, what do you mean? And also, and at the same time, who the\r\ndevil are you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is as a friend I come to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then in that case you may go; I happen to be overstocked in that line\r\njust now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not with the kind of friend I am!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The saints forefend!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You love her,--you love Miss Lindon! Can you bear to think of him in\r\nher arms?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI took off my mask,--feeling that the occasion required it. As I did so\r\nhe brushed aside the hanging folds of the hood of his burnoose, so that\r\nI saw more of his face. I was immediately conscious that in his eyes\r\nthere was, in an especial degree, what, for want of a better term, one\r\nmay call the mesmeric quality. That his was one of those morbid\r\norganisations which are oftener found, thank goodness, in the east than\r\nin the west, and which are apt to exercise an uncanny influence over\r\nthe weak and the foolish folk with whom they come in contact,--the kind\r\nof creature for whom it is always just as well to keep a seasoned rope\r\nclose handy. I was, also, conscious that he was taking advantage of the\r\nremoval of my mask to try his strength on me,--than which he could not\r\nhave found a tougher job. The sensitive something which is found in the\r\nhypnotic subject happens, in me, to be wholly absent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see you are a mesmerist.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe started.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am nothing,--a shadow!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I\xe2\x80\x99m a scientist. I should like, with your permission--or without\r\nit!--to try an experiment or two on you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe moved further back. There came a gleam into his eyes which suggested\r\nthat he possessed his hideous power to an unusual degree,--that, in the\r\nestimation of his own people, he was qualified to take his standing as\r\na regular devil-doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We will try experiments together, you and I,--on Paul Lessingham.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why on him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You do not know?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why do you lie to me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t lie to you,--I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the faintest notion what is the nature\r\nof your interest in Mr Lessingham.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My interest?--that is another thing; it is your interest of which we\r\nare speaking.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me,--it is yours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Listen! you love her,--and he! But at a word from you he shall not\r\nhave her,--never! It is I who say it,--I!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And, once more, sir, who are you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am of the children of Isis!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that so?--It occurs to me that you have made a slight\r\nmistake,--this is London, not a dog-hole in the desert.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do I not know?--what does it matter?--you shall see! There will come a\r\ntime when you will want me,--you will find that you cannot bear to\r\nthink of him in her arms,--her whom you love! You will call to me, and\r\nI shall come, and of Paul Lessingham there shall be an end.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhile I was wondering whether he was really as mad as he sounded, or\r\nwhether he was some impudent charlatan who had an axe of his own to\r\ngrind, and thought that he had found in me a grindstone, he had\r\nvanished from the room. I moved after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hang it all!--stop!\xe2\x80\x99 I cried.\r\n\r\nHe must have made pretty good travelling, because, before I had a foot\r\nin the hall, I heard the front door slam, and, when I reached the\r\nstreet, intent on calling him back, neither to the right nor to the\r\nleft was there a sign of him to be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XIII.\r\n THE PICTURE\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wonder what that nice-looking beggar really means, and who he\r\nhappens to be?\xe2\x80\x99 That was what I said to myself when I returned to the\r\nlaboratory. \xe2\x80\x98If it is true that, now and again, Providence does write a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s character on his face, then there can\xe2\x80\x99t be the slightest shred of\r\na doubt that a curious one\xe2\x80\x99s been written on his. I wonder what his\r\nconnection has been with the Apostle,--or if it\xe2\x80\x99s only part of his game\r\nof bluff.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI strode up and down,--for the moment my interest in the experiments I\r\nwas conducting had waned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If it was all bluff I never saw a better piece of acting,--and yet\r\nwhat sort of finger can such a precisian as St Paul have in such a pie?\r\nThe fellow seemed to squirm at the mere mention of the\r\nrising-hope-of-the-Radicals\xe2\x80\x99 name. Can the objection be political? Let\r\nme consider,--what has Lessingham done which could offend the religious\r\nor patriotic susceptibilities of the most fanatical of Orientals?\r\nPolitically, I can recall nothing. Foreign affairs, as a rule, he has\r\ncarefully eschewed. If he has offended--and if he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the seeming\r\nwas uncommonly good!--the cause will have to be sought upon some other\r\ntrack. But, then, what track?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe more I strove to puzzle it out, the greater the puzzlement grew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Absurd!--The rascal has had no more connection with St Paul than St\r\nPeter. The probability is that he\xe2\x80\x99s a crackpot; and if he isn\xe2\x80\x99t, he has\r\nsome little game on foot--in close association with the hunt of the\r\noof-bird!--which he tried to work off on me, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. As for--for\r\nMarjorie--my Marjorie!--only she isn\xe2\x80\x99t mine, confound it!--if I had had\r\nmy senses about me, I should have broken his head in several places for\r\ndaring to allow her name to pass his lips,--the unbaptised\r\nMohammedan!--Now to return to the chase of splendid murder!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI snatched up my mask--one of the most ingenious inventions, by the\r\nway, of recent years; if the armies of the future wear my mask they\r\nwill defy my weapon!--and was about to re-adjust it in its place, when\r\nsomeone knocked at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s there?--Come in!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was Edwards. He looked round him as if surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, sir,--I thought you were engaged. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nthat--that gentleman had gone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He went up the chimney, as all that kind of gentlemen do.--Why the\r\ndeuce did you let him in when I told you not to?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really, sir, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I gave him your message, and--he looked\r\nat me, and--that is all I remember till I found myself standing in\r\nthis room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHad it not been Edwards I might have suspected him of having had his\r\npalm well greased,--but, in his case, I knew better. It was as I\r\nthought,--my visitor was a mesmerist of the first class; he had\r\nactually played some of his tricks, in broad daylight, on my servant,\r\nat my own front door,--a man worth studying. Edwards continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is someone else, sir, who wishes to see you,--Mr Lessingham.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Lessingham!\xe2\x80\x99 At that moment the juxtaposition seemed odd, though I\r\ndaresay it was so rather in appearance than in reality. \xe2\x80\x98Show him in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPresently in came Paul.\r\n\r\nI am free to confess,--I have owned it before!--that, in a sense, I\r\nadmire that man,--so long as he does not presume to thrust himself into\r\na certain position. He possesses physical qualities which please my\r\neye--speaking as a mere biologist. I like the suggestion conveyed by\r\nhis every pose, his every movement, of a tenacious hold on life,--of\r\nreserve force, of a repository of bone and gristle on which he can fall\r\nback at pleasure. The fellow\xe2\x80\x99s lithe and active; not hasty, yet agile;\r\nclean built, well hung,--the sort of man who might be relied upon to\r\nmake a good recovery. You might beat him in a sprint,--mental or\r\nphysical--though to do that you would have to be spry!--but in a\r\nstaying race he would see you out. I do not know that he is exactly the\r\nkind of man whom I would trust,--unless I knew that he was on the\r\njob,--which knowledge, in his case, would be uncommonly hard to attain.\r\nHe is too calm; too self-contained; with the knack of looking all round\r\nhim even in moments of extremest peril,--and for whatever he does he\r\nhas a good excuse. He has the reputation, both in the House and out of\r\nit, of being a man of iron nerve,--and with some reason; yet I am not\r\nso sure. Unless I read him wrongly his is one of those individualities\r\nwhich, confronted by certain eventualities, collapse,--to rise, the\r\nmoment of trial having passed, like Phoenix from her ashes. However it\r\nmight be with his adherents, he would show no trace of his disaster.\r\n\r\nAnd this was the man whom Marjorie loved. Well, she could show some\r\ncause. He was a man of position,--destined, probably, to rise much\r\nhigher; a man of parts,--with capacity to make the most of them; not\r\nill-looking; with agreeable manners,--when he chose; and he came within\r\nthe lady\xe2\x80\x99s definition of a gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98he always did the right thing,\r\nat the right time, in the right way.\xe2\x80\x99 And yet--! Well, I take it that\r\nwe are all cads, and that we most of us are prigs; for mercy\xe2\x80\x99s sake do\r\nnot let us all give ourselves away.\r\n\r\nHe was dressed as a gentleman should be dressed,--black frock coat,\r\nblack vest, dark grey trousers, stand-up collar, smartly-tied bow,\r\ngloves of the proper shade, neatly brushed hair, and a smile, which if\r\nwas not childlike, at any rate was bland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not disturbing you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sure?--I never enter a place like this, where a man is matching\r\nhimself with nature, to wrest from her her secrets, without feeling\r\nthat I am crossing the threshold of the unknown. The last time I was in\r\nthis room was just after you had taken out the final patents for your\r\nSystem of Telegraphy at Sea, which the Admiralty\r\npurchased,--wisely--What is it, now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Death.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No?--really?--what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you are a member of the next government, you will possibly learn; I\r\nmay offer them the refusal of a new wrinkle in the art of murder.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see,--a new projectile.--How long is this race to continue between\r\nattack and defence?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Until the sun grows cold.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99ll be no defence,--nothing to defend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with his calm, grave eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The theory of the Age of Ice towards which we are advancing is not a\r\ncheerful one.\xe2\x80\x99 He began to finger a glass retort which lay upon a\r\ntable. \xe2\x80\x98By the way, it was very good of you to give me a look in last\r\nnight. I am afraid you thought me peremptory,--I have come to\r\napologise.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I thought you peremptory; I thought you--queer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99 He glanced at me with that expressionless look upon his face\r\nwhich he could summon at will, and which is at the bottom of the\r\nsuperstition about his iron nerve. \xe2\x80\x98I was worried, and not well.\r\nBesides, one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care to be burgled, even by a maniac.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was he a maniac?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you see him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very clearly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the street.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How close were you to him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Closer than I am to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you were so close to him as that. Did you try to\r\nstop him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Easier said than done,--he was off at such a rate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you see how he was dressed,--or, rather, undressed?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In nothing but a cloak on such a night. Who but a lunatic would have\r\nattempted burglary in such a costume?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did he take anything?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Absolutely nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It seems to have been a curious episode.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe moved his eyebrows,--according to members of the House the only\r\ngesture in which he has been known to indulge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We become accustomed to curious episodes. Oblige me by not mentioning\r\nit to anyone,--to anyone.\xe2\x80\x99 He repeated the last two words, as if to\r\ngive them emphasis. I wondered if he was thinking of Marjorie. \xe2\x80\x98I am\r\ncommunicating with the police. Until they move I don\xe2\x80\x99t want it to get\r\ninto the papers,--or to be talked about. It\xe2\x80\x99s a worry,--you understand?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI nodded. He changed the theme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This that you\xe2\x80\x99re engaged upon,--is it a projectile or a weapon?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you are a member of the next government you will possibly know; if\r\nyou aren\xe2\x80\x99t you possibly won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose you have to keep this sort of thing secret?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do. It seems that matters of much less moment you wish to keep\r\nsecret.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You mean that business of last night? If a trifle of that sort gets\r\ninto the papers, or gets talked about,--which is the same thing!--you\r\nhave no notion how we are pestered. It becomes an almost unbearable\r\nnuisance. Jones the Unknown can commit murder with less inconvenience\r\nto himself than Jones the Notorious can have his pocket picked,--there\r\nis not so much exaggeration in that as there sounds.--Good-bye,--thanks\r\nfor your promise.\xe2\x80\x99 I had given him no promise, but that was by the way.\r\nHe turned as to go,--then stopped. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s another thing,--I believe\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re a specialist on questions of ancient superstitions and extinct\r\nreligions.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am interested in such subjects, but I am not a specialist.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can you tell me what were the exact tenets of the worshippers of Isis?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Neither I nor any man,--with scientific certainty. As you know, she\r\nhad a brother; the cult of Osiris and Isis was one and the same. What,\r\nprecisely, were its dogmas, or its practices, or anything about it,\r\nnone, now, can tell. The Papyri, hieroglyphics, and so on, which remain\r\nare very far from being exhaustive, and our knowledge of those which do\r\nremain, is still less so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose that the marvels which are told of it are purely legendary?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To what marvels do you particularly refer?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Weren\xe2\x80\x99t supernatural powers attributed to the priests of Isis?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Broadly speaking, at that time, supernatural powers were attributed to\r\nall the priests of all the creeds.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see.\xe2\x80\x99 Presently he continued. \xe2\x80\x98I presume that her cult is long since\r\nextinct,--that none of the worshippers of Isis exist to-day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI hesitated,--I was wondering why he had hit on such a subject; if he\r\nreally had a reason, or if he was merely asking questions as a cover\r\nfor something else,--you see, I knew my Paul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is not so sure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with that passionless, yet searching glance of his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You think that she still is worshipped?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think it possible, even probable, that, here and there, in\r\nAfrica--Africa is a large order!--homage is paid to Isis, quite in the\r\ngood old way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know that as a fact?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Excuse me, but do you know it as a fact?--Are you aware that you are\r\ntreating me as if I was on the witness stand?--Have you any special\r\npurpose in making these inquiries?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In a kind of a way I have. I have recently come across rather a\r\ncurious story; I am trying to get to the bottom of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is the story?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid that at present I am not at liberty to tell it you; when I\r\nam I will. You will find it interesting,--as an instance of a singular\r\nsurvival.--Didn\xe2\x80\x99t the followers of Isis believe in transmigration?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Some of them,--no doubt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did they understand by transmigration?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Transmigration.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,--but of the soul or of the body?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How do you mean?--transmigration is transmigration. Are you driving at\r\nsomething in particular? If you\xe2\x80\x99ll tell me fairly and squarely what it\r\nis I\xe2\x80\x99ll do my best to give you the information you require; as it is,\r\nyour questions are a bit perplexing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,--as you say, \xe2\x80\x9ctransmigration is\r\ntransmigration.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 I was eyeing him keenly; I seemed to detect in his\r\nmanner an odd reluctance to enlarge on the subject he himself had\r\nstarted. He continued to trifle with the retort upon the table. \xe2\x80\x98Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthe followers of Isis a--what shall I say?--a sacred emblem?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t they an especial regard for some sort of a--wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it some sort\r\nof a--beetle?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You mean _Scarabaeus sacer_,--according to Latreille, _Scarabaeus\r\nEgyptiorum_? Undoubtedly,--the scarab was venerated throughout\r\nEgypt,--indeed, speaking generally, most things that had life, for\r\ninstance, cats; as you know, Orisis continued among men in the figure\r\nof Apis, the bull.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Weren\xe2\x80\x99t the priests of Isis--or some of them--supposed to assume,\r\nafter death, the form of a--scarabaeus?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never heard of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you sure?--think!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to answer such a question positively, offhand, but I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t, on the spur of the moment, recall any supposition of the kind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t laugh at me--I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lunatic!--but I understand that recent\r\nresearches have shown that even in some of the most astounding of the\r\nancient legends there was a substratum of fact. Is it absolutely\r\ncertain that there could be no shred of truth in such a belief?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In what belief?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the belief that a priest of Isis--or anyone--assumed after death\r\nthe form of a scarabaeus?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It seems to me, Lessingham, that you have lately come across some\r\nuncommonly interesting data, of a kind, too, which it is your bounden\r\nduty to give to the world,--or, at any rate, to that portion of the\r\nworld which is represented by me. Come,--tell us all about it!--what\r\nare you afraid of?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid of nothing,--and some day you shall be told,--but not now.\r\nAt present, answer my question.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then repeat your question,--clearly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it absolutely certain that there could be no foundation of truth in\r\nthe belief that a priest of Isis--or anyone--assumed after death the\r\nform of a beetle?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know no more than the man in the moon,--how the dickens should I?\r\nSuch a belief may have been symbolical. Christians believe that after\r\ndeath the body takes the shape of worms--and so, in a sense, it\r\ndoes,--and, sometimes, eels.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is not what I mean.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Listen. If a person, of whose veracity there could not be a vestige of\r\na doubt, assured you that he had seen such a transformation actually\r\ntake place, could it conceivably be explained on natural grounds?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Seen a priest of Isis assume the form of a beetle?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Or a follower of Isis?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Before, or after death?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe hesitated. I had seldom seen him wear such an appearance of\r\ninterest,--to be frank, I was keenly interested too!--but, on a sudden\r\nthere came into his eyes a glint of something that was almost terror.\r\nWhen he spoke, it was with the most unwonted awkwardness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In--in the very act of dying.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the very act of dying?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If--he had seen a follower of Isis in--the very act of dying,\r\nassume--the form of a--a beetle, on any conceivable grounds would such\r\na transformation be susceptible of a natural explanation?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI stared,--as who would not? Such an extraordinary question was\r\nrendered more extraordinary by coming from such a man,--yet I was\r\nalmost beginning to suspect that there was something behind it more\r\nextraordinary still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look here, Lessingham, I can see you\xe2\x80\x99ve a capital tale to tell,--so\r\ntell it, man! Unless I\xe2\x80\x99m mistaken, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the kind of tale in which\r\nordinary scruples can have any part or parcel,--anyhow, it\xe2\x80\x99s hardly\r\nfair of you to set my curiosity all agog, and then to leave it\r\nunappeased.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe eyed me steadily, the appearance of interest fading more and more,\r\nuntil, presently, his face assumed its wonted expressionless\r\nmask,--somehow I was conscious that what he had seen in my face was not\r\naltogether to his liking. His voice was once more bland and\r\nself-contained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I perceive you are of opinion that I have been told a taradiddle. I\r\nsuppose I have.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But what is the tarradiddle?--don\xe2\x80\x99t you see I\xe2\x80\x99m burning?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Unfortunately, Atherton, I am on my honour. Until I have permission to\r\nunloose it, my tongue is tied.\xe2\x80\x99 He picked up his hat and umbrella from\r\nwhere he had placed them on the table. Holding them in his left hand,\r\nhe advanced to me with his right outstretched. \xe2\x80\x98It is very good of you\r\nto suffer my continued interruption; I know, to my sorrow, what such\r\ninterruptions mean,--believe me, I am not ungrateful. What is this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn the shelf, within a foot or so of where I stood, was a sheet of\r\npaper,--the size and shape of half a sheet of post note. At this he\r\nstooped to glance. As he did so, something surprising occurred. On the\r\ninstant a look came on to his face which, literally, transfigured him.\r\nHis hat and umbrella fell from his grasp on to the floor. He retreated,\r\ngibbering, his hands held out as if to ward something off from him,\r\nuntil he reached the wall on the other side of the room. A more amazing\r\nspectacle than he presented I never saw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lessingham!\xe2\x80\x99 I exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMy first impression was that he was struck by a fit of\r\nepilepsy,--though anyone less like an epileptic subject it would be\r\nhard to find. In my bewilderment I looked round to see what could be\r\nthe immediate cause. My eye fell upon the sheet of paper. I stared at\r\nit with considerable surprise. I had not noticed it there previously, I\r\nhad not put it there,--where had it come from? The curious thing was\r\nthat, on it, produced apparently by some process of photogravure, was\r\nan illustration of a species of beetle with which I felt that I ought\r\nto be acquainted, and yet was not. It was of a dull golden green; the\r\ncolour was so well brought out,--even to the extent of seeming to\r\nscintillate, and the whole thing was so dexterously done that the\r\ncreature seemed alive. The semblance of reality was, indeed, so vivid\r\nthat it needed a second glance to be assured that it was a mere trick\r\nof the reproducer. Its presence there was odd,--after what we had been\r\ntalking about it might seem to need explanation; but it was absurd to\r\nsuppose that that alone could have had such an effect on a man like\r\nLessingham.\r\n\r\nWith the thing in my hand, I crossed to where he was,--pressing his\r\nback against the wall, he had shrunk lower inch by inch till he was\r\nactually crouching on his haunches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lessingham!--come, man, what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTaking him by the shoulder, I shook him with some vigour. My touch had\r\non him the effect of seeming to wake him out of a dream, of restoring\r\nhim to consciousness as against the nightmare horrors with which he was\r\nstruggling. He gazed up at me with that look of cunning on his face\r\nwhich one associates with abject terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Atherton?--Is it you?--It\xe2\x80\x99s all right,--quite right.--I\xe2\x80\x99m well,--very\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he slowly drew himself up, till he was standing erect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then, in that case, all I can say is that you have a queer way of\r\nbeing very well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe put his hand up to his mouth, as if to hide the trembling of his\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s the pressure of overwork,--I\xe2\x80\x99ve had one or two attacks like\r\nthis,--but it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing, only--a local lesion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI observed him keenly; to my thinking there was something about him\r\nwhich was very odd indeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only a local lesion!--If you take my strongly-urged advice you\xe2\x80\x99ll get\r\na medical opinion without delay,--if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been wise enough to\r\nhave done so already.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to-day;--at once; but I know it\xe2\x80\x99s only mental overstrain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re sure it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to do with this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI held out in front of him the photogravure of the beetle. As I did so\r\nhe backed away from me, shrieking, trembling as with palsy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take it away! take it away!\xe2\x80\x99 he screamed.\r\n\r\nI stared at him, for some seconds, astonished into speechlessness. Then\r\nI found my tongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lessingham!--It\xe2\x80\x99s only a picture!--Are you stark mad?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe persisted in his ejaculations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take it away! take it away!--Tear it up!--Burn it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis agitation was so unnatural,--from whatever cause it arose!--that,\r\nfearing the recurrence of the attack from which he had just recovered,\r\nI did as he bade me. I tore the sheet of paper into quarters, and,\r\nstriking a match, set fire to each separate piece. He watched the\r\nprocess of incineration as if fascinated. When it was concluded, and\r\nnothing but ashes remained, he gave a gasp of relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lessingham,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re either mad already, or you\xe2\x80\x99re going\r\nmad,--which is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think it\xe2\x80\x99s neither. I believe I am as sane as you. It\xe2\x80\x99s--it\xe2\x80\x99s that\r\nstory of which I was speaking; it--it seems curious, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you\r\nall about it--some day. As I observed, I think you will find it an\r\ninteresting instance of a singular survival.\xe2\x80\x99 He made an obvious effort\r\nto become more like his usual self. \xe2\x80\x98It is extremely unfortunate,\r\nAtherton, that I should have troubled you with such a display of\r\nweakness,--especially as I am able to offer you so scant an\r\nexplanation. One thing I would ask of you,--to observe strict\r\nconfidence. What has taken place has been between ourselves. I am in\r\nyour hands, but you are my friend, I know I can rely on you not to\r\nspeak of it to anyone,--and, in particular, not to breathe a hint of it\r\nto Miss Lindon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, in particular, not to Miss Lindon?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can you not guess?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI hunched my shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If what I guess is what you mean is not that a cause the more why\r\nsilence would be unfair to her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is for me to speak, if for anyone. I shall not fail to do what\r\nshould be done.--Give me your promise that you will not hint a word to\r\nher of what you have so unfortunately seen?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI gave him the promise he required.\r\n\r\n * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThere was no more work for me that day. The Apostle, his divagations,\r\nhis example of the coleoptera, his Arabian friend,--these things were\r\nas microbes which, acting on a system already predisposed for their\r\nreception, produced high fever; I was in a fever,--of unrest. Brain in\r\na whirl!--Marjorie, Paul, Isis, beetle, mesmerism, in delirious jumble.\r\nLove\xe2\x80\x99s upsetting!--in itself a sufficiently severe disease; but when\r\ncomplications intervene, suggestive of mystery and novelties, so that\r\nyou do not know if you are moving in an atmosphere of dreams or of\r\nfrozen facts,--if, then, your temperature does not rise, like that\r\nrocket of M. Verne\xe2\x80\x99s,--which reached the moon, then you are a freak of\r\nan entirely genuine kind, and if the surgeons do not preserve you, and\r\nplace you on view, in pickle, they ought to, for the sake of historical\r\ndoubters, for no one will believe that there ever was a man like you,\r\nunless you yourself are somewhere around to prove them Thomases.\r\n\r\nMyself,--I am not that kind of man. When I get warm I grow heated, and\r\nwhen I am heated there is likely to be a variety show of a gaudy kind.\r\nWhen Paul had gone I tried to think things out, and if I had kept on\r\ntrying something would have happened--so I went on the river instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XIV.\r\n THE DUCHESS\xe2\x80\x99 BALL\r\n\r\nThat night was the Duchess of Datchet\xe2\x80\x99s ball--the first person I saw\r\nas I entered the dancing-room was Dora Grayling.\r\n\r\nI went straight up to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Grayling, I behaved very badly to you last night. I have come to\r\nmake to you my apologies,--to sue for your forgiveness!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My forgiveness?\xe2\x80\x99 Her head went back,--she has a pretty bird-like trick\r\nof cocking it a little on one side. \xe2\x80\x98You were not well. Are you better?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite.--You forgive me? Then grant me plenary absolution by giving me\r\na dance for the one I lost last night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe rose. A man came up,--a stranger to me; she\xe2\x80\x99s one of the best\r\nhunted women in England,--there\xe2\x80\x99s a million with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is my dance, Miss Grayling.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe looked at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must excuse me. I am afraid I have made a mistake. I had forgotten\r\nthat I was already engaged.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI had not thought her capable of it. She took my arm, and away we went,\r\nand left him staring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s he who\xe2\x80\x99s the sufferer now,\xe2\x80\x99 I whispered, as we went round,--she\r\ncan waltz!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You think so? It was I last night,--I did not mean, if I could help\r\nit, to suffer again. To me a dance with you means something.\xe2\x80\x99 She went\r\nall red,--adding, as an afterthought, \xe2\x80\x98Nowadays so few men really\r\ndance. I expect it\xe2\x80\x99s because you dance so well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe danced the waltz right through, then we went to an impromptu shelter\r\nwhich had been rigged up on a balcony. And we talked. There\xe2\x80\x99s something\r\nsympathetic about Miss Grayling which leads one to talk about one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nself,--before I was half aware of it I was telling her of all my plans\r\nand projects,--actually telling her of my latest notion which,\r\nultimately, was to result in the destruction of whole armies as by a\r\nflash of lightning. She took an amount of interest in it which was\r\nsurprising.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What really stands in the way of things of this sort is not theory but\r\npractice,--one can prove one\xe2\x80\x99s facts on paper, or on a small scale in a\r\nroom; what is wanted is proof on a large scale, by actual experiment.\r\nIf, for instance, I could take my plant to one of the forests of South\r\nAmerica, where there is plenty of animal life but no human, I could\r\ndemonstrate the soundness of my position then and there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Think of the money it would cost.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought I was a friend of yours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I had hoped you were.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then why don\xe2\x80\x99t you let me help you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Help me?--How?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By letting you have the money for your South American experiment;--it\r\nwould be an investment on which I should expect to receive good\r\ninterest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI fidgeted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is very good of you, Miss Grayling, to talk like that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe became quite frigid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Please don\xe2\x80\x99t be absurd!--I perceive quite clearly that you are\r\nsnubbing me, and that you are trying to do it as delicately as you know\r\nhow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Grayling!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I understand that it was an impertinence on my part to volunteer\r\nassistance which was unasked; you have made that sufficiently plain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I assure you--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray don\xe2\x80\x99t. Of course, if it had been Miss Lindon it would have been\r\ndifferent; she would at least have received a civil answer. But we are\r\nnot all Miss Lindon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI was aghast. The outburst was so uncalled for,--I had not the faintest\r\nnotion what I had said or done to cause it; she was in such a\r\nsurprising passion--and it suited her!--I thought I had never seen her\r\nlook prettier,--I could do nothing else but stare. So she went\r\non,--with just as little reason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here is someone coming to claim this dance,--I can\xe2\x80\x99t throw all my\r\npartners over. Have I offended you so irremediably that it will be\r\nimpossible for you to dance with me again?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Grayling!--I shall be only too delighted.\xe2\x80\x99 She handed me her\r\ncard. \xe2\x80\x98Which may I have?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For your own sake you had better place it as far off as you possibly\r\ncan.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They all seem taken.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter; strike off any name you please, anywhere and put\r\nyour own instead.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was giving me an almost embarrassingly free hand. I booked myself\r\nfor the next waltz but two,--who it was who would have to give way to\r\nme I did not trouble to inquire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Atherton!--Is that you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was,--it was also she. It was Marjorie! And so soon as I saw her I\r\nknew that there was only one woman in the world for me,--the mere sight\r\nof her sent the blood tingling through my veins. Turning to her\r\nattendant cavalier, she dismissed him with a bow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is there an empty chair?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe seated herself in the one Miss Grayling had just vacated. I sat\r\ndown beside her. She glanced at me, laughter in her eyes. I was all in\r\na stupid tremblement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You remember that last night I told you that I might require your\r\nfriendly services in diplomatic intervention?\xe2\x80\x99 I nodded,--I felt that\r\nthe allusion was unfair. \xe2\x80\x98Well, the occasion\xe2\x80\x99s come,--or, at least,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s very near.\xe2\x80\x99 She was still,--and I said nothing to help her. \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nknow how unreasonable papa can be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI did,--never a more pig-headed man in England than Geoffrey\r\nLindon,--or, in a sense, a duller. But, just then, I was not prepared\r\nto admit it to his child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know what an absurd objection he has to--Paul.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was an appreciative hesitation before she uttered the fellow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nChristian name,--when it came it was with an accent of tenderness which\r\nstung me like a gadfly. To speak to me--of all men,--of the fellow in\r\nsuch a tone was--like a woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has Mr Lindon no notion of how things stand between you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Except what he suspects. That is just where you are to come in, papa\r\nthinks so much of you--I want you to sound Paul\xe2\x80\x99s praises in his\r\near--to prepare him for what must come.\xe2\x80\x99 Was ever rejected lover\r\nburdened with such a task? Its enormity kept me still. \xe2\x80\x98Sydney, you\r\nhave always been my friend,--my truest, dearest friend. When I was a\r\nlittle girl you used to come between papa and me, to shield me from his\r\nwrath. Now that I am a big girl I want you to be on my side once more,\r\nand to shield me still.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer voice softened. She laid her hand upon my arm. How, under her\r\ntouch, I burned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what cause there has been for secrecy,--why\r\nshould there have been any secrecy from the first?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was Paul\xe2\x80\x99s wish that papa should not be told.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is Mr Lessingham ashamed of you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sydney!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Or does he fear your father?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are unkind. You know perfectly well that papa has been prejudiced\r\nagainst him all along, you know that his political position is just now\r\none of the greatest difficulty, that every nerve and muscle is kept on\r\nthe continual strain, that it is in the highest degree essential that\r\nfurther complications of every and any sort should be avoided. He is\r\nquite aware that his suit will not be approved of by papa, and he\r\nsimply wishes that nothing shall be said about it till the end of the\r\nsession,--that is all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see! Mr Lessingham is cautious even in love-making,--politician\r\nfirst, and lover afterwards.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!--why not?--would you have him injure the cause he has at heart\r\nfor want of a little patience?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It depends what cause it is he has at heart.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is the matter with you?--why do you speak to me like that?--it is\r\nnot like you at all.\xe2\x80\x99 She looked at me shrewdly, with flashing eyes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it possible that you are--jealous?--that you were in earnest in\r\nwhat you said last night?--I thought that was the sort of thing you\r\nsaid to every girl.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI would have given a great deal to take her in my arms, and press her\r\nto my bosom then and there,--to think that she should taunt me with\r\nhaving said to her the sort of thing I said to every girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you know of Mr Lessingham?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What all the world knows,--that history will be made by him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There are kinds of history in the making of which one would not desire\r\nto be associated. What do you know of his private life,--it was to that\r\nthat I was referring.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really,--you go too far. I know that he is one of the best, just as he\r\nis one of the greatest, of men; for me, that is sufficient.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you do know that, it is sufficient.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do know it,--all the world knows it. Everyone with whom he comes in\r\ncontact is aware--must be aware, that he is incapable of a\r\ndishonourable thought or action.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take my advice, don\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate any man too highly. In the book of\r\nevery man\xe2\x80\x99s life there is a page which he would wish to keep turned\r\ndown.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is no such page in Paul\xe2\x80\x99s,--there may be in yours; I think that\r\nprobable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you. I fear it is more than probable. I fear that, in my case,\r\nthe page may extend to several. There is nothing Apostolic about\r\nme,--not even the name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sydney!--you are unendurable!--It is the more strange to hear you talk\r\nlike this since Paul regards you as his friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He flatters me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you not his friend?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it not sufficient to be yours?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,--who is against Paul is against me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is hard.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How is it hard? Who is against the husband can hardly be for the\r\nwife,--when the husband and the wife are one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But as yet you are not one.--Is my cause so hopeless?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you call your cause?--are you thinking of that nonsense you\r\nwere talking about last night?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe laughed!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You call it nonsense.--You ask for sympathy, and give--so much!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will give you all the sympathy you stand in need of,--I promise it!\r\nMy poor, dear Sydney!--don\xe2\x80\x99t be so absurd! Do you think that I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow you? You\xe2\x80\x99re the best of friends, and the worst of lovers,--as the\r\none, so true; so fickle as the other. To my certain knowledge, with how\r\nmany girls have you been in love,--and out again. It is true that, to\r\nthe best of my knowledge and belief, you have never been in love with\r\nme before,--but that\xe2\x80\x99s the merest accident. Believe me, my dear, dear\r\nSydney, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be in love with someone else to-morrow,--if you\xe2\x80\x99re not\r\nhalf-way there to-night. I confess, quite frankly, that, in that\r\ndirection, all the experience I have had of you has in nowise\r\nstrengthened my prophetic instinct. Cheer up!--one never knows!--Who is\r\nthis that\xe2\x80\x99s coming?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was Dora Grayling who was coming,--I went off with her without a\r\nword,--we were half-way through the dance before she spoke to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sorry that I was cross to you just now, and--disagreeable.\r\nSomehow I always seem destined to show to you my most unpleasant side.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The blame was mine,--what sort of side do I show you? You are far\r\nkinder to me than I deserve,--now, and always.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is what you say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me, it\xe2\x80\x99s true,--else how comes it that, at this time of day,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m without a friend in all the world?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You!--without a friend!--I never knew a man who had so many!--I never\r\nknew a person of whom so many men and women join in speaking well!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Grayling!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As for never having done anything worth doing, think of what you have\r\ndone. Think of your discoveries, think of your inventions, think\r\nof--but never mind! The world knows you have done great things, and it\r\nconfidently looks to you to do still greater. You talk of being\r\nfriendless, and yet when I ask, as a favour--as a great favour!--to be\r\nallowed to do something to show my friendship, you--well, you snub me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I snub you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know you snubbed me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you really mean that you take an interest in--in my work?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know I mean it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe turned to me, her face all glowing,--and I did know it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you come to my laboratory to-morrow morning?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will I!--won\xe2\x80\x99t I!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With your aunt?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, with my aunt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you round, and tell you all there is to be told, and then if\r\nyou still think there\xe2\x80\x99s anything in it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll accept your offer about\r\nthat South American experiment,--that is, if it still holds good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course it still holds good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And we\xe2\x80\x99ll be partners.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Partners?--Yes,--we will be partners.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It will cost a terrific sum.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There are some things which never can cost too much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s not my experience.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope it will be mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a bargain?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On my side, I promise you that it\xe2\x80\x99s a bargain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen I got outside the room I found that Percy Woodville was at my\r\nside. His round face was, in a manner of speaking, as long as my arm. He\r\ntook his glass out of his eye, and rubbed it with his handkerchief,--and\r\ndirectly he put it back he took it out and rubbed it again. I believe\r\nthat I never saw him in such a state of fluster,--and, when one speaks\r\nof Woodville, that means something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Atherton, I am in a devil of a stew.\xe2\x80\x99 He looked it. \xe2\x80\x98All of a\r\nheap!--I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a blow which I shall never get over!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then get under.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWoodville is one of those fellows who will insist on telling me their\r\nmost private matters,--even to what they owe their washerwomen for the\r\nruination of their shirts. Why, goodness alone can tell,--heaven knows\r\nI am not sympathetic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be an idiot!--you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\xe2\x80\x99m suffering!--I\xe2\x80\x99m as nearly\r\nas possible stark mad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s all right, old chap,--I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you that way more than once\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk like that,--you\xe2\x80\x99re not a perfect brute!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I bet you a shilling that I am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t torture me,--you\xe2\x80\x99re not. Atherton!\xe2\x80\x99 He seized me by the lapels\r\nof my coat, seeming half beside himself,--fortunately he had drawn me\r\ninto a recess, so that we were noticed by few observers. \xe2\x80\x98What do you\r\nthink has happened?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear chap, how on earth am I to know?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s refused me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has she!--Well I never!--Buck up,--try some other address,--there are\r\nquite as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Atherton, you\xe2\x80\x99re a blackguard.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had crumpled his handkerchief into a ball, and was actually bobbing\r\nat his eyes with it,--the idea of Percy Woodville being dissolved in\r\ntears was excruciatingly funny,--but, just then, I could hardly tell\r\nhim so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s not a doubt of it,--it\xe2\x80\x99s my way of being sympathetic. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nso down, man,--try her again!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s not the slightest use--I know it isn\xe2\x80\x99t--from the way she treated\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be so sure--women often say what they mean least. Who\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nlady?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who?--Is there more women in the world than one for me, or has there\r\never been? You ask me who! What does the word mean to me but Marjorie\r\nLindon!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Marjorie Lindon?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI fancy that my jaw dropped open,--that, to use his own vernacular, I\r\nwas \xe2\x80\x98all of a heap.\xe2\x80\x99 I felt like it.\r\n\r\nI strode away--leaving him mazed--and all but ran into Marjorie\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m just leaving. Will you see me to the carriage, Mr Atherton?\xe2\x80\x99 I saw\r\nher to the carriage. \xe2\x80\x98Are you off?--can I give you a lift?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you,--I am not thinking of being off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m going to the House of Commons,--won\xe2\x80\x99t you come?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What are you going there for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDirectly she spoke of it I knew why she was going,--and she knew that I\r\nknew, as her words showed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are quite well aware of what the magnet is. You are not so\r\nignorant as not to know that the Agricultural Amendment Act is on\r\nto-night, and that Paul is to speak. I always try to be there when Paul\r\nis to speak, and I mean to always keep on trying.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is a fortunate man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed,--and again indeed. A man with such gifts as his is\r\ninadequately described as fortunate.--But I must be off. He expected to\r\nbe up before, but I heard from him a few minutes ago that there has\r\nbeen a delay, but that he will be up within half-an-hour.--Till our\r\nnext meeting.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs I returned into the house, in the hall I met Percy Woodville. He had\r\nhis hat on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where are you off to?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m off to the House.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To hear Paul Lessingham?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Damn Paul Lessingham!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With all my heart!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a division expected,--I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Someone else has gone to hear Paul Lessingham,--Marjorie Lindon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No!--you don\xe2\x80\x99t say so!--by Jove!--I say, Atherton, I wish I could make\r\na speech,--I never can. When I\xe2\x80\x99m electioneering I have to have my\r\nspeeches written for me, and then I have to read \xe2\x80\x99em. But, by Jove, if\r\nI knew Miss Lindon was in the gallery, and if I knew anything about the\r\nthing, or could get someone to tell me something, hang me if I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nspeak,--I\xe2\x80\x99d show her I\xe2\x80\x99m not the fool she thinks I am!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Speak, Percy, speak!--you\xe2\x80\x99d knock \xe2\x80\x99em silly, sir!--I tell you what\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll do,--I\xe2\x80\x99ll come with you! I\xe2\x80\x99ll to the House as well!--Paul\r\nLessingham shall have an audience of three.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XV.\r\n MR LESSINGHAM SPEAKS\r\n\r\nThe House was full. Percy and I went upstairs,--to the gallery which\r\nis theoretically supposed to be reserved for what are called\r\n\xe2\x80\x98distinguished strangers,\xe2\x80\x99--those curious animals. Trumperton was up,\r\nhammering out those sentences which smell, not so much of the lamp as\r\nof the dunderhead. Nobody was listening,--except the men in the Press\r\nGallery; where is the brain of the House, and ninety per cent. of its\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\nIt was not till Trumperton had finished that I discovered Lessingham.\r\nThe tedious ancient resumed his seat amidst a murmur of sounds which, I\r\nhave no doubt, some of the pressmen interpreted next day as \xe2\x80\x98loud and\r\ncontinued applause.\xe2\x80\x99 There was movement in the House, possibly\r\nexpressive of relief; a hum of voices; men came flocking in. Then, from\r\nthe Opposition benches, there rose a sound which was applause,--and I\r\nperceived that, on a cross bench close to the gangway, Paul Lessingham\r\nwas standing up bareheaded.\r\n\r\nI eyed him critically,--as a collector might eye a valuable specimen,\r\nor a pathologist a curious subject. During the last four and twenty\r\nhours my interest in him had grown apace. Just then, to me, he was the\r\nmost interesting man the world contained.\r\n\r\nWhen I remembered how I had seen him that same morning, a nerveless,\r\nterror-stricken wretch, grovelling, like some craven cur, upon the\r\nfloor, frightened, to the verge of imbecility, by a shadow, and less\r\nthan a shadow, I was confronted by two hypotheses. Either I had\r\nexaggerated his condition then, or I exaggerated his condition now. So\r\nfar as appearance went, it was incredible that this man could be that\r\none.\r\n\r\nI confess that my feeling rapidly became one of admiration. I love the\r\nfighter. I quickly recognised that here we had him in perfection. There\r\nwas no seeming about him then,--the man was to the manner born. To his\r\nfinger-tips a fighting man. I had never realised it so clearly before.\r\nHe was coolness itself. He had all his faculties under complete\r\ncommand. While never, for a moment, really exposing himself, he would\r\nbe swift in perceiving the slightest weakness in his opponents\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndefence, and, so soon as he saw it, like lightning, he would slip in a\r\ntelling blow. Though defeated, he would hardly be disgraced; and one\r\nmight easily believe that their very victories would be so expensive to\r\nhis assailants, that, in the end, they would actually conduce to his\r\nown triumph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hang me!\xe2\x80\x99 I told myself, \xe2\x80\x98if, after all, I am surprised if Marjorie\r\ndoes see something in him.\xe2\x80\x99 For I perceived how a clever and\r\nimaginative young woman, seeing him at his best, holding his own, like\r\na gallant knight, against overwhelming odds, in the lists in which he\r\nwas so much at home, might come to think of him as if he were always\r\nand only there, ignoring altogether the kind of man he was when the\r\njoust was finished.\r\n\r\nIt did me good to hear him, I do know that,--and I could easily imagine\r\nthe effect he had on one particular auditor who was in the Ladies\xe2\x80\x99\r\nCage. It was very far from being an \xe2\x80\x98oration\xe2\x80\x99 in the American sense; it\r\nhad little or nothing of the fire and fury of the French Tribune; it\r\nwas marked neither by the ponderosity nor the sentiment of the eloquent\r\nGerman; yet it was as satisfying as are the efforts of either of the\r\nthree, producing, without doubt, precisely the effect which the speaker\r\nintended. His voice was clear and calm, not exactly musical, yet\r\ndistinctly pleasant, and it was so managed that each word he uttered\r\nwas as audible to every person present as if it had been addressed\r\nparticularly to him. His sentences were short and crisp; the words\r\nwhich he used were not big ones, but they came from him with an\r\nagreeable ease; and he spoke just fast enough to keep one\xe2\x80\x99s interest\r\nalert without involving a strain on the attention.\r\n\r\nHe commenced by making, in the quietest and most courteous manner,\r\nsarcastic comments on the speeches and methods of Trumperton and his\r\nfriends which tickled the House amazingly. But he did not make the\r\nmistake of pushing his personalities too far. To a speaker of a certain\r\nsort nothing is easier than to sting to madness. If he likes, his every\r\nword is barbed. Wounds so given fester; they are not easily\r\nforgiven;--it is essential to a politician that he should have his\r\nfirmest friends among the fools; or his climbing days will soon be\r\nover. Soon his sarcasms were at an end. He began to exchange them for\r\nsweet-sounding phrases. He actually began to say pleasant things to his\r\nopponents; apparently to mean them. To put them in a good conceit with\r\nthemselves. He pointed out how much truth there was in what they said;\r\nand then, as if by accident, with what ease and at how little cost,\r\namendments might be made. He found their arguments, and took them for\r\nhis own, and flattered them, whether they would or would not, by\r\nshowing how firmly they were founded upon fact; and grafted other\r\narguments upon them, which seemed their natural sequelae; and\r\ntransformed them, and drove them hither and thither; and brought\r\nthem--their own arguments!--to a round, irrefragable conclusion, which\r\nwas diametrically the reverse of that to which they themselves had\r\nbrought them. And he did it all with an aptness, a readiness, a grace,\r\nwhich was incontestable. So that, when he sat down, he had performed\r\nthat most difficult of all feats, he had delivered what, in a House of\r\nCommons\xe2\x80\x99 sense, was a practical, statesmanlike speech, and yet one\r\nwhich left his hearers in an excellent humour.\r\n\r\nIt was a great success,--an immense success. A parliamentary triumph of\r\nalmost the highest order. Paul Lessingham had been coming on by leaps\r\nand bounds. When he resumed his seat, amidst applause which, this time,\r\nreally was applause, there were, probably, few who doubted that he was\r\ndestined to go still farther. How much farther it is true that time\r\nalone could tell; but, so far as appearances went, all the prizes,\r\nwhich are as the crown and climax of a statesman\xe2\x80\x99s career, were well\r\nwithin his reach.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I was delighted. I had enjoyed an intellectual\r\nexercise,--a species of enjoyment not so common as it might be. The\r\nApostle had almost persuaded me that the political game was one worth\r\nplaying, and that its triumphs were things to be desired. It is\r\nsomething, after all, to be able to appeal successfully to the passions\r\nand aspirations of your peers; to gain their plaudits; to prove your\r\nskill at the game you yourself have chosen; to be looked up to and\r\nadmired. And when a woman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes look down on you, and her ears drink\r\nin your every word, and her heart beats time with yours,--each man to\r\nhis own temperament, but when that woman is the woman whom you love, to\r\nknow that your triumph means her glory, and her gladness, to me that\r\nwould be the best part of it all.\r\n\r\nIn that hour,--the Apostle\xe2\x80\x99s hour!--I almost wished that I were a\r\npolitician too!\r\n\r\nThe division was over. The business of the night was practically done.\r\nI was back again in the lobby! The theme of conversation was the\r\nApostle\xe2\x80\x99s speech,--on every side they talked of it.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Marjorie was at my side. Her face was glowing. I never saw her\r\nlook more beautiful,--or happier. She seemed to be alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So you have come, after all!--Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it splendid?--wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it\r\nmagnificent? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it grand to have such great gifts, and to use them\r\nto such good purpose?--Speak, Sydney! Don\xe2\x80\x99t feign a coolness which is\r\nforeign to your nature!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI saw that she was hungry for me to praise the man whom she delighted\r\nto honour. But, somehow, her enthusiasm cooled mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was not a bad speech, of a kind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of a kind!\xe2\x80\x99 How her eyes flashed fire! With what disdain she treated\r\nme! \xe2\x80\x98What do you mean by \xe2\x80\x9cof a kind?\xe2\x80\x9d My dear Sydney, are you not aware\r\nthat it is an attribute of small minds to attempt to belittle those\r\nwhich are greater? Even if you are conscious of inferiority, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunwise to show it. Mr Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s was a great speech, of any kind;\r\nyour incapacity to recognise the fact simply reveals your lack of the\r\ncritical faculty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is fortunate for Mr Lessingham that there is at least one person in\r\nwhom the critical faculty is so bountifully developed. Apparently, in\r\nyour judgment, he who discriminates is lost.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI thought she was going to burst into passion. But, instead, laughing,\r\nshe placed her hand upon my shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor Sydney!--I understand!--It is so sad!--Do you know you are like a\r\nlittle boy who, when he is beaten, declares that the victor has cheated\r\nhim. Never mind! as you grow older, you will learn better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe stung me almost beyond bearing,--I cared not what I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You, unless I am mistaken, will learn better before you are older.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBefore I could have told her--if I had meant to tell; which I did\r\nnot--Lessingham came up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope I have not kept you waiting; I have been delayed longer than I\r\nexpected.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all,--though I am quite ready to get away; it\xe2\x80\x99s a little\r\ntiresome waiting here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis with a mischievous glance towards me,--a glance which compelled\r\nLessingham to notice me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You do not often favour us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t. I find better employment for my time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are wrong. It\xe2\x80\x99s the cant of the day to underrate the House of\r\nCommons, and the work which it performs; don\xe2\x80\x99t you suffer yourself to\r\njoin in the chorus of the simpletons. Your time cannot be better\r\nemployed than in endeavouring to improve the body politic.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am obliged to you.--I hope you are feeling better than when I saw\r\nyou last.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA gleam came into his eyes, fading as quickly as it came. He showed no\r\nother sign of comprehension, surprise, or resentment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you.--I am very well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut Marjorie perceived that I meant more than met the eye, and that\r\nwhat I meant was meant unpleasantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come,--let us be off. It is Mr Atherton to-night who is not well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe had just slipped her arm through Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s when her father\r\napproached. Old Lindon stared at her on the Apostle\xe2\x80\x99s arm, as if he\r\ncould hardly believe that it was she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought that you were at the Duchess\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I have been, papa; and now I\xe2\x80\x99m here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here!\xe2\x80\x99 Old Lindon began to stutter and stammer, and to grow red in the\r\nface, as is his wont when at all excited. \xe2\x80\x98W--what do you mean by\r\nhere?--wh--where\xe2\x80\x99s the carriage?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where should it be, except waiting for me outside,--unless the horses\r\nhave run away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I--I--I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you down to it. I--I don\xe2\x80\x99t approve of y--your\r\nw--w--waiting in a place like this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, papa, but Mr Lessingham is going to take me down.--I shall\r\nsee you afterwards.--Good-bye.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnything cooler than the way in which she walked off I do not think I\r\never saw. This is the age of feminine advancement. Young women think\r\nnothing of twisting their mothers round their fingers, let alone their\r\nfathers; but the fashion in which that young woman walked off, on the\r\nApostle\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and left her father standing there, was, in its way, a\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nLindon seemed scarcely able to realise that the pair of them had gone.\r\nEven after they had disappeared in the crowd he stood staring after\r\nthem, growing redder and redder, till the veins stood out upon his\r\nface, and I thought that an apoplectic seizure threatened. Then, with a\r\ngasp, he turned to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Damned scoundrel!\xe2\x80\x99 I took it for granted that he alluded to the\r\ngentleman,--even though his following words hardly suggested it. \xe2\x80\x98Only\r\nthis morning I forbade her to have anything to do with him, and n--now\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s w--walked off with her! C--confounded adventurer! That\xe2\x80\x99s what he\r\nis, an adventurer, and before many hours have passed I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the\r\nliberty to tell him so!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJamming his fists into his pockets, and puffing like a grampus in\r\ndistress, he took himself away,--and it was time he did, for his words\r\nwere as audible as they were pointed, and already people were wondering\r\nwhat the matter was. Woodville came up as Lindon was going,--just as\r\nsorely distressed as ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She went away with Lessingham,--did you see her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course I saw her. When a man makes a speech like Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s any\r\ngirl would go away with him,--and be proud to. When you are endowed\r\nwith such great powers as he is, and use them for such lofty purposes,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll walk away with you,--but, till then, never.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was at his old trick of polishing his eyeglass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s bitter hard. When I knew that she was there, I\xe2\x80\x99d half a mind to\r\nmake a speech myself, upon my word I had, only I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to\r\nspeak about, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak anyhow,--how can a fellow speak when\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s shoved into the gallery?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As you say, how can he?--he can\xe2\x80\x99t stand on the railing and\r\nshout,--even with a friend holding him behind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know I shall speak one day,--bound to; and then she won\xe2\x80\x99t be there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99ll be better for you if she isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Think so?--Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99re right. I\xe2\x80\x99d be safe to make a mess of it, and\r\nthen, if she were to see me at it, it\xe2\x80\x99d be the devil! \xe2\x80\x99Pon my word,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been wishing, lately, I was clever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe rubbed his nose with the rim of his eyeglass, looking the most\r\ncomically disconsolate figure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Put black care behind you, Percy!--buck up, my boy! The division\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nover--you are free--now we\xe2\x80\x99ll go \xe2\x80\x9con the fly.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd we did \xe2\x80\x98go on the fly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XVI.\r\n ATHERTON\xe2\x80\x99S MAGIC VAPOUR\r\n\r\nI bore him off to supper at the Helicon. All the way in the cab he was\r\ntrying to tell me the story of how he proposed to Marjorie,--and he was\r\nvery far from being through with it when we reached the club. There was\r\nthe usual crowd of supperites, but we got a little table to ourselves,\r\nin a corner of the room, and before anything was brought for us to eat\r\nhe was at it again. A good many of the people were pretty near to\r\nshouting, and as they seemed to be all speaking at once, and the band\r\nwas playing, and as the Helicon supper band is not piano, Percy did not\r\nhave it quite all to himself, but, considering the delicacy of his\r\nsubject, he talked as loudly as was decent,--getting more so as he went\r\non. But Percy is peculiar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many times I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to tell her,--over and over\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, pretty near every time I met her,--but I never seemed to get\r\nquite to it, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How was that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, just as I was going to say, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Lindon, may I offer you the\r\ngift of my affection--\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was that how you invariably intended to begin?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, not always--one time like that, another time another way. Fact\r\nis, I got off a little speech by heart, but I never got a chance to\r\nreel it off, so I made up my mind to just say anything.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what did you say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, nothing,--you see, I never got there. Just as I was feeling my\r\nway, she\xe2\x80\x99d ask me if I preferred big sleeves to little ones, or top\r\nhats to billycocks, or some nonsense of the kind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would she now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,--of course I had to answer, and by the time I\xe2\x80\x99d answered the\r\nchance was lost.\xe2\x80\x99 Percy was polishing his eyeglass. \xe2\x80\x98I tried to get\r\nthere so many times, and she choked me off so often, that I can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nthinking that she suspected what it was that I was after.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You think she did?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She must have done. Once I followed her down Piccadilly, and chivied\r\nher into a glove shop in the Burlington Arcade. I meant to propose to\r\nher in there,--I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had a wink of sleep all night through dreaming\r\nof her, and I was just about desperate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And did you propose?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The girl behind the counter made me buy a dozen pairs of gloves\r\ninstead. They turned out to be three sizes too large for me when they\r\ncame home. I believe she thought I\xe2\x80\x99d gone to spoon the glove girl,--she\r\nwent out and left me there. That girl loaded me with all sorts of\r\nthings when she was gone,--I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get away. She held me with her\r\nblessed eye. I believe it was a glass one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Lindon\xe2\x80\x99s?--or the glove girl\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The glove girl\xe2\x80\x99s. She sent me home a whole cartload of green ties, and\r\ndeclared I\xe2\x80\x99d ordered them. I shall never forget that day. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never\r\nbeen up the Arcade since, and never mean to.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You gave Miss Lindon a wrong impression.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I was always giving her wrong impressions. Once she said\r\nthat she knew I was not a marrying man, that I was the sort of chap who\r\nnever would marry, because she saw it in my face.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Under the circumstances, that was trying.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bitter hard.\xe2\x80\x99 Percy sighed again. \xe2\x80\x98I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so\r\ngone. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a fellow who does get gone, but when I do get gone, I get\r\nso beastly gone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I tell you what, Percy,--have a drink!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m a teetotaler,--you know I am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You talk of your heart being broken, and of your being a teetotaler in\r\nthe same breath,--if your heart were really broken you\xe2\x80\x99d throw\r\nteetotalism to the winds.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think so,--why?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because you would,--men whose hearts are broken always do,--you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nswallow a magnum at the least.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPercy groaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When I drink I\xe2\x80\x99m always ill,--but I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a try.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had a try,--making a good beginning by emptying at a draught the\r\nglass which the waiter had just now filled. Then he relapsed into\r\nmelancholy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me, Percy,--honest Indian!--do you really love her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Love her?\xe2\x80\x99 His eyes grew round as saucers. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you that I\r\nlove her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know you tell me, but that sort of thing is easy telling. What does\r\nit make you feel like, this love you talk so much about?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Feel like?--Just anyhow,--and nohow. You should look inside me, and\r\nthen you\xe2\x80\x99d know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see.--It\xe2\x80\x99s like that, is it?--Suppose she loved another man, what\r\nsort of feeling would you feel towards him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Does she love another man?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say, suppose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I dare say she does. I expect that\xe2\x80\x99s it.--What an idiot I am not to\r\nhave thought of that before.\xe2\x80\x99 He sighed,--and refilled his glass. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na lucky chap, whoever he is. I\xe2\x80\x99d--I\xe2\x80\x99d like to tell him so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99d like to tell him so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s such a jolly lucky chap, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Possibly,--but his jolly good luck is your jolly bad luck. Would you\r\nbe willing to resign her to him without a word?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If she loves him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you say you love her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course I do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose that, because I love her, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to see\r\nher happy?--I\xe2\x80\x99m not such a beast!--I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner see her happy than\r\nanything else in all the world.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see.--Even happy with another?--I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid that my philosophy is not\r\nlike yours. If I loved Miss Lindon, and she loved, say, Jones, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like that towards Jones at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What would you feel like?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Murder.--Percy, you come home with me,--we\xe2\x80\x99ve begun the night\r\ntogether, let\xe2\x80\x99s end it together,--and I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you one of the finest\r\nnotions for committing murder on a scale of real magnificence you ever\r\ndreamed of. I should like to make use of it to show my feelings towards\r\nthe supposititious Jones,--he\xe2\x80\x99d know what I felt for him when once he\r\nhad been introduced to it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPercy went with me without a word. He had not had much to drink, but it\r\nhad been too much for him, and he was in a condition of maundering\r\nsentimentality. I got him into a cab. We dashed along Piccadilly.\r\n\r\nHe was silent, and sat looking in front of him with an air of vacuous\r\nsullenness which ill-became his cast of countenance. I bade the cabman\r\npass though Lowndes Square. As we passed the Apostle\xe2\x80\x99s I pulled him up.\r\nI pointed out the place to Woodville.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You see, Percy, that\xe2\x80\x99s Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s house!--that\xe2\x80\x99s the house of the\r\nman who went away with Marjorie!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99 Words came from him slowly, with a quite unnecessary stress on\r\neach. \xe2\x80\x98Because he made a speech.--I\xe2\x80\x99d like to make a speech.--One day\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll make a speech.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because he made a speech,--only that, and nothing more! When a man\r\nspeaks with an Apostle\xe2\x80\x99s tongue, he can witch any woman in the\r\nland.--Hallo, who\xe2\x80\x99s that?--Lessingham, is that you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI saw, or thought I saw, someone, or something, glide up the steps, and\r\nwithdraw into the shadow of the doorway, as if unwilling to be seen.\r\nWhen I hailed no one answered. I called again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be shy, my friend!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI sprang out of the cab, ran across the pavement, and up the steps. To\r\nmy surprise, there was no one in the doorway. It seemed incredible, but\r\nthe place was empty. I felt about me with my hands, as if I had been\r\nplaying at blind man\xe2\x80\x99s buff, and grasped at vacancy. I came down a step\r\nor two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ostensibly, there\xe2\x80\x99s a vacuum,--which nature abhors.--I say, driver,\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t you see someone come up the steps?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought I did, sir,--I could have sworn I did.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So could I.--It\xe2\x80\x99s very odd.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps whoever it was has gone into the \xe2\x80\x99ouse, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how. We should have heard the door open, if we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen\r\nit,--and we should have seen it, it\xe2\x80\x99s not so dark as that.--I\xe2\x80\x99ve half a\r\nmind to ring the bell and inquire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that if I was you, sir,--you jump in, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get\r\nalong. This is Mr Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s,--the great Mr Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI believe the cabman thought that I was drunk,--and not respectable\r\nenough to claim acquaintance with the great Mr Lessingham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wake up, Woodville! Do you know I believe there\xe2\x80\x99s some mystery about\r\nthis place,--I feel assured of it. I feel as if I were in the presence\r\nof something uncanny,--something which I can neither see, nor touch,\r\nnor hear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe cabman bent down from his seat, wheedling me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Jump in, sir, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be getting along.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI jumped in, and we got along,--but not far. Before we had gone a dozen\r\nyards, I was out again, without troubling the driver to stop. He pulled\r\nup, aggrieved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, sir, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter now? You\xe2\x80\x99ll be damaging yourself before\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve done, and then you\xe2\x80\x99ll be blaming me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI had caught sight of a cat crouching in the shadow of the railings,--a\r\nblack one. That cat was my quarry. Either the creature was unusually\r\nsleepy, or slow, or stupid, or it had lost its wits--which a cat seldom\r\ndoes lose!--anyhow, without making an attempt to escape it allowed me\r\nto grab it by the nape of the neck.\r\n\r\nSo soon as we were inside my laboratory, I put the cat into my glass\r\nbox. Percy stared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What have you put it there for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That, my dear Percy, is what you are shortly about to see. You are\r\nabout to be the witness of an experiment which, to a legislator--such\r\nas you are!--ought to be of the greatest possible interest. I am going\r\nto demonstrate, on a small scale, the action of the force which, on a\r\nlarge scale, I propose to employ on behalf of my native land.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe showed no signs of being interested. Sinking into a chair, he\r\nrecommenced his wearisome reiteration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hate cats!--Do let it go!--I\xe2\x80\x99m always miserable when there\xe2\x80\x99s a cat\r\nin the room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense,--that\xe2\x80\x99s your fancy! What you want\xe2\x80\x99s a taste of\r\nwhisky--you\xe2\x80\x99ll be as chirpy as a cricket.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything more to drink!--I\xe2\x80\x99ve had too much already!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI paid no heed to what he said. I poured two stiff doses into a couple\r\nof tumblers. Without seeming to be aware of what it was that he was\r\ndoing he disposed of the better half of the one I gave him at a\r\ndraught. Putting his glass upon the table, he dropped his head upon his\r\nhands, and groaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What would Marjorie think of me if she saw me now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Think?--nothing. Why should she think of a man like you, when she has\r\nso much better fish to fry?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling frightfully ill!--I\xe2\x80\x99ll be drunk before I\xe2\x80\x99ve done!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then be drunk!--only, for gracious sake, be lively drunk, not deadly\r\ndoleful.--Cheer up, Percy!\xe2\x80\x99 I clapped him on the shoulder,--almost\r\nknocking him off his seat on to the floor. \xe2\x80\x98I am now going to show you\r\nthat little experiment of which I was speaking!--You see that cat?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course I see it!--the beast!--I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d let it go!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why should I let it go?--Do you know whose cat that is? That cat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nPaul Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Paul Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Paul Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s,--the man who made the speech,--the man whom\r\nMarjorie went away with.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How do you know it\xe2\x80\x99s his?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know it is, but I believe it is,--I choose to believe it\r\nis!--I intend to believe it is!--It was outside his house, therefore\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s his cat,--that\xe2\x80\x99s how I argue. I can\xe2\x80\x99t get Lessingham inside that\r\nbox, so I get his cat instead.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whatever for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shall see.--You observe how happy it is?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It don\xe2\x80\x99t seem happy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ve all our ways of seeming happy,--that\xe2\x80\x99s its way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe creature was behaving like a cat gone mad, dashing itself against\r\nthe sides of its glass prison, leaping to and fro, and from side to\r\nside, squealing with rage, or with terror, or with both. Perhaps it\r\nforesaw what was coming,--there is no fathoming the intelligence of\r\nwhat we call the lower animals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a funny way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We some of us have funny ways, beside cats. Now, attention! Observe\r\nthis little toy,--you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen something of its kind before. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nspring gun; you pull the spring--drop the charge into the\r\nbarrel--release the spring--and the charge is fired. I\xe2\x80\x99ll unlock this\r\nsafe, which is built into the wall. It\xe2\x80\x99s a letter lock, the combination\r\njust now, is \xe2\x80\x9cwhisky,\xe2\x80\x9d--you see, that\xe2\x80\x99s a hint to you. You\xe2\x80\x99ll notice\r\nthe safe is strongly made,--it\xe2\x80\x99s air-tight, fire-proof, the outer\r\ncasing is of triple-plated drill-proof steel,--the contents are\r\nvaluable--to me!--and devilish dangerous,--I\xe2\x80\x99d pity the thief who, in\r\nhis innocent ignorance, broke in to steal. Look inside,--you see it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfull of balls,--glass balls, each in its own little separate nest;\r\nlight as feathers; transparent,--you can see right through them. Here\r\nare a couple, like tiny pills. They contain neither dynamite, nor\r\ncordite, nor anything of the kind, yet, given a fair field and no\r\nfavour, they\xe2\x80\x99ll work more mischief than all the explosives man has\r\nfashioned. Take hold of one--you say your heart is broken!--squeeze\r\nthis under your nose--it wants but a gentle pressure--and in less time\r\nthan no time you\xe2\x80\x99ll be in the land where they say there are no broken\r\nhearts.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe shrunk back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.--I don\xe2\x80\x99t want the thing.--Take\r\nit away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Think twice,--the chance may not recur.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I tell you I don\xe2\x80\x99t want it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sure?--Consider!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course I\xe2\x80\x99m sure!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then the cat shall have it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let the poor brute go!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The poor brute\xe2\x80\x99s going,--to the land which is so near, and yet so far.\r\nOnce more, if you please, attention. Notice what I do with this toy\r\ngun. I pull back the spring; I insert this small glass pellet; I thrust\r\nthe muzzle of the gun through the opening in the glass box which\r\ncontains the Apostle\xe2\x80\x99s cat,--you\xe2\x80\x99ll observe it fits quite close, which,\r\non the whole, is perhaps as well for us.--I am about to release the\r\nspring.--Close attention, please.--Notice the effect.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Atherton, let the brute go!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The brute\xe2\x80\x99s gone! I\xe2\x80\x99ve released the spring--the pellet has been\r\ndischarged--it has struck against the roof of the glass box--it has\r\nbeen broken by the contact,--and, hey presto! the cat lies dead,--and\r\nthat in face of its nine lives. You perceive how still it is,--how\r\nstill! Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope that, now, it\xe2\x80\x99s really happy. The cat which I choose\r\nto believe is Paul Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s has received its quietus; in the\r\nmorning I\xe2\x80\x99ll send it back to him, with my respectful compliments. He\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmiss it if I don\xe2\x80\x99t.--Reflect! think of a huge bomb, filled with what\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll call Atherton\xe2\x80\x99s Magic Vapour, fired, say, from a hundred and\r\ntwenty ton gun, bursting at a given elevation over the heads of an\r\nopposing force. Properly managed, in less than an instant of time, a\r\nhundred thousand men,--quite possibly more!--would drop down dead, as\r\nif smitten by the lightning of the skies. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that something like a\r\nweapon, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not well!--I want to get away!--I wish I\xe2\x80\x99d never come!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat was all Woodville had to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rubbish!--You\xe2\x80\x99re adding to your stock of information every second,\r\nand, in these days, when a member of Parliament is supposed to know all\r\nabout everything, information\xe2\x80\x99s the one thing wanted. Empty your glass,\r\nman,--that\xe2\x80\x99s the time of day for you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI handed him his tumbler. He drained what was left of its contents,\r\nthen, in a fit of tipsy, childish temper he flung the tumbler from him.\r\nI had placed--carelessly enough--the second pellet within a foot of the\r\nedge of the table. The shock of the heavy beaker striking the board\r\nclose to it, set it rolling. I was at the other side. I started forward\r\nto stop its motion, but I was too late. Before I could reach the\r\ncrystal globule, it had fallen off the edge of the table on to the\r\nfloor at Woodville\xe2\x80\x99s feet, and smashed in falling. As it smashed, he\r\nwas looking down, wondering, no doubt, in his stupidity, what the\r\npother was about,--for I was shouting, and making something of a\r\nclatter in my efforts to prevent the catastrophe which I saw was\r\ncoming. On the instant, as the vapour secreted in the broken pellet\r\ngained access to the air, he fell forward on to his face. Rushing to\r\nhim, I snatched his senseless body from the ground, and dragged it,\r\nstaggeringly, towards the door which opened on to the yard. Flinging\r\nthe door open, I got him into the open air.\r\n\r\nAs I did so, I found myself confronted by someone who stood outside. It\r\nwas Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s mysterious Egypto-Arabian friend,--my morning\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvisitor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XVII.\r\n MAGIC?--OR MIRACLE?\r\n\r\nThe passage into the yard from the electrically lit laboratory was a\r\npassage from brilliancy to gloom. The shrouded figure standing in the\r\nshadow, was like some object in a dream. My own senses reeled. It was\r\nonly because I had resolutely held my breath, and kept my face averted\r\nthat I had not succumbed to the fate which had overtaken Woodville. Had\r\nI been a moment longer in gaining the open air, it would have been too\r\nlate. As it was, in placing Woodville on the ground, I stumbled over\r\nhim. My senses left me. Even as they went I was conscious of\r\nexclaiming,--remembering the saying about the engineer being hoist by\r\nhis own petard,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Atherton\xe2\x80\x99s Magic Vapour!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMy sensations on returning to consciousness were curious. I found\r\nmyself being supported in someone\xe2\x80\x99s arms, a stranger\xe2\x80\x99s face was bending\r\nover me, and the most extraordinary pair of eyes I had ever seen were\r\nlooking into mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who the deuce are you?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked.\r\n\r\nThen, understanding that it was my uninvited visitor, with scant\r\nceremony I drew myself away from him. By the light which was streaming\r\nthrough the laboratory door I saw that Woodville was lying close beside\r\nme,--stark and still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is he dead?\xe2\x80\x99 I cried. \xe2\x80\x98Percy!--speak, man!--it\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad with you\r\nas that!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut it was pretty bad,--so bad that, as I bent down and looked at him,\r\nmy heart beat uncomfortably fast lest it was as bad as it could be. His\r\nheart seemed still,--the vapour took effect directly on the cardiac\r\ncentres. To revive their action, and that instantly, was indispensable.\r\nYet my brain was in such a whirl that I could not even think of how to\r\nset about beginning. Had I been alone, it is more than probable\r\nWoodville would have died. As I stared at him, senselessly, aimlessly,\r\nthe stranger, passing his arms beneath his body, extended himself at\r\nfull length upon his motionless form. Putting his lips to Percy\xe2\x80\x99s, he\r\nseemed to be pumping life from his own body into the unconscious man\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nAs I gazed bewildered, surprised, presently there came a movement of\r\nPercy\xe2\x80\x99s body. His limbs twitched, as if he was in pain. By degrees, the\r\nmotions became convulsive,--till on a sudden he bestirred himself to\r\nsuch effect that the stranger was rolled right off him. I bent\r\ndown,--to find that the young gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s condition still seemed very\r\nfar from satisfactory. There was a rigidity about the muscles of his\r\nface, a clamminess about his skin, a disagreeable suggestiveness about\r\nthe way in which his teeth and the whites of his eyes were exposed,\r\nwhich was uncomfortable to contemplate.\r\n\r\nThe stranger must have seen what was passing through my mind,--not a\r\nvery difficult thing to see. Pointing to the recumbent Percy, he said,\r\nwith that queer foreign twang of his, which, whatever it had seemed\r\nlike in the morning, sounded musical enough just then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All will be well with him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not so sure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe stranger did not deign to answer. He was kneeling on one side of\r\nthe victim of modern science, I on the other. Passing his hand to and\r\nfro in front of the unconscious countenance, as if by magic all\r\nsemblance of discomfort vanished from Percy\xe2\x80\x99s features, and, to all\r\nappearances, he was placidly asleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you hypnotised him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What does it matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIf it was a case of hypnotism, it was very neatly done. The conditions\r\nwere both unusual and trying, the effect produced seemed all that could\r\nbe desired,--the change brought about in half a dozen seconds was quite\r\nremarkable. I began to be aware of a feeling of quasi-respect for Paul\r\nLessingham\xe2\x80\x99s friend. His morals might be peculiar, and manners he might\r\nhave none, but in this case, at any rate, the end seemed to have\r\njustified the means. He went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He sleeps. When he awakes he will remember nothing that has been.\r\nLeave him,--the night is warm,--all will be well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he said, the night was warm,--and it was dry. Percy would come to\r\nlittle harm by being allowed to enjoy, for a while, the pleasant\r\nbreezes. So I acted on the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s advice, and left him lying in the\r\nyard, while I had a little interview with the impromptu physician.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n THE APOTHEOSIS OF THE BEETLE\r\n\r\nThe laboratory door was closed. The stranger was standing a foot or two\r\naway from it. I was further within the room, and was subjecting him to\r\nas keen a scrutiny as circumstances permitted. Beyond doubt he was\r\nconscious of my observation, yet he bore himself with an air of\r\nindifference, which was suggestive of perfect unconcern. The fellow was\r\noriental to the finger-tips,--that much was certain; yet in spite of a\r\npretty wide personal knowledge of oriental people I could not make up\r\nmy mind as to the exact part of the east from which he came. He was\r\nhardly an Arab, he was not a fellah,--he was not, unless I erred, a\r\nMohammedan at all. There was something about him which was distinctly\r\nnot Mussulmanic. So far as looks were concerned, he was not a\r\nflattering example of his race, whatever his race might be. The\r\nportentous size of his beak-like nose would have been, in itself,\r\nsufficient to damn him in any court of beauty. His lips were thick and\r\nshapeless,--and this, joined to another peculiarity in his appearance,\r\nseemed to suggest that, in his veins there ran more than a streak of\r\nnegro blood. The peculiarity alluded to was his semblance of great age.\r\nAs one eyed him one was reminded of the legends told of people who have\r\nbeen supposed to have retained something of their pristine vigour after\r\nhaving lived for centuries. As, however, one continued to gaze, one\r\nbegan to wonder if he really was so old as he seemed,--if, indeed, he\r\nwas exceptionally old at all. Negroes, and especially negresses, are\r\napt to age with extreme rapidity. Among coloured folk one sometimes\r\nencounters women whose faces seem to have been lined by the passage of\r\ncenturies, yet whose actual tale of years would entitle them to regard\r\nthemselves, here in England, as in the prime of life. The senility of\r\nthe fellow\xe2\x80\x99s countenance, besides, was contradicted by the juvenescence\r\nof his eyes. No really old man could have had eyes like that. They were\r\ncuriously shaped, reminding me of the elongated, faceted eyes of some\r\nqueer creature, with whose appearance I was familiar, although I could\r\nnot, at the instant, recall its name. They glowed not only with the\r\nforce and fire, but, also, with the frenzy of youth. More\r\nuncanny-looking eyes I had never encountered,--their possessor could\r\nnot be, in any sense of the word, a clubable person. Owing, probably,\r\nto some peculiar formation of the optic-nerve one felt, as one met his\r\ngaze, that he was looking right through you. More obvious danger\r\nsignals never yet were placed in a creature\xe2\x80\x99s head. The individual who,\r\nhaving once caught sight of him, still sought to cultivate their\r\nowner\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance, had only himself to thank if the very worst\r\nresults of frequenting evil company promptly ensued.\r\n\r\nIt happens that I am myself endowed with an unusual tenacity of vision.\r\nI could, for instance, easily outstare any man I ever met. Yet, as I\r\ncontinued to stare at this man, I was conscious that it was only by an\r\neffort of will that I was able to resist a baleful something which\r\nseemed to be passing from his eyes to mine. It might have been\r\nimagination, but, in that sense, I am not an imaginative man; and, if\r\nit was, it was imagination of an unpleasantly vivid kind. I could\r\nunderstand how, in the case of a nervous, or a sensitive temperament,\r\nthe fellow might exercise, by means of the peculiar quality of his\r\nglance alone, an influence of a most disastrous sort, which given an\r\nappropriate subject in the manifestation of its power might approach\r\nalmost to the supernatural. If ever man was endowed with the\r\ntraditional evil eye, in which Italians, among modern nations, are such\r\nprofound believers, it was he.\r\n\r\nWhen we had stared at each other for, I daresay, quite five minutes, I\r\nbegan to think I had had about enough of it. So, by way of breaking the\r\nice, I put to him a question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May I ask how you found your way into my back yard?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe did not reply in words, but, raising his hands he lowered them,\r\npalms downward, with a gesture which was peculiarly oriental.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed?--Is that so?--Your meaning may be lucidity itself to you, but,\r\nfor my benefit, perhaps you would not mind translating it into words.\r\nOnce more I ask, how did you find your way into my back yard?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain nothing but the gesture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Possibly you are not sufficiently acquainted with English manners and\r\ncustoms to be aware that you have placed yourself within reach of the\r\npains and penalties of the law. Were I to call in the police you would\r\nfind yourself in an awkward situation,--and, unless you are presently\r\nmore explanatory, called in they will be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBy way of answer he indulged in a distortion of the countenance which\r\nmight have been meant for a smile,--and which seemed to suggest that he\r\nregarded the police with a contempt which was too great for words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why do you laugh--do you think that being threatened with the police\r\nis a joke? You are not likely to find it so.--Have you suddenly been\r\nbereft of the use of your tongue?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe proved that he had not by using it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have still the use of my tongue.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That, at least, is something. Perhaps, since the subject of how you\r\ngot into my back yard seems to be a delicate one, you will tell me why\r\nyou got there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know why I have come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me if I appear to flatly contradict you, but that is precisely\r\nwhat I do not know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You do know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do I?--Then, in that case, I presume that you are here for the reason\r\nwhich appears upon the surface,--to commit a felony.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You call me thief?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What else are you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am no thief.--You know why I have come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe raised his head a little. A look came into his eyes which I felt\r\nthat I ought to understand, yet to the meaning of which I seemed, for\r\nthe instant, to have mislaid the key. I shrugged my shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have come because you wanted me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because I wanted you!--On my word!--That\xe2\x80\x99s sublime!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All night you have wanted me,--do I not know? When she talked to you\r\nof him, and the blood boiled in your veins; when he spoke, and all the\r\npeople listened, and you hated him, because he had honour in her eyes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI was startled. Either he meant what it appeared incredible that he\r\ncould mean, or--there was confusion somewhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take my advice, my friend, and don\xe2\x80\x99t try to come the bunco-steerer\r\nover me,--I\xe2\x80\x99m a bit in that line myself, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis time the score was mine,--he was puzzled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know not what you talk of.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In that case, we\xe2\x80\x99re equal,--I know not what you talk of either.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis manner, for him, was childlike and bland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it you do not know? This morning did I not say,--if you want\r\nme, then I come?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I fancy I have some faint recollection of your being so good as to say\r\nsomething of the kind, but--where\xe2\x80\x99s the application?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you not feel for him the same as I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s the him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Paul Lessingham.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was spoken quietly, but with a degree of--to put it\r\ngently--spitefulness which showed that at least the will to do the\r\nApostle harm would not be lacking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And, pray, what is the common feeling which we have for him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPlainly, with this gentleman, hate meant hate,--in the solid oriental\r\nsense. I should hardly have been surprised if the mere utterance of the\r\nwords had seared his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am by no means prepared to admit that I have this feeling which you\r\nattribute to me, but, even granting that I have, what then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Those who hate are kin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That, also, I should be slow to admit; but--to go a step farther--what\r\nhas all this to do with your presence on my premises at this hour of\r\nthe night?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You love her.\xe2\x80\x99 This time I did not ask him to supply the name,--being\r\nunwilling that it should be soiled by the traffic of his lips. \xe2\x80\x98She\r\nloves him,--that is not well. If you choose, she shall love you,--that\r\nwill be well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed.--And pray how is this consummation which is so devoutly to be\r\ndesired to be brought about?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Put your hand into mine. Say that you wish it. It shall be done.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMoving a step forward, he stretched out his hand towards me. I\r\nhesitated. There was that in the fellow\xe2\x80\x99s manner which, for the moment,\r\nhad for me an unwholesome fascination. Memories flashed through my mind\r\nof stupid stories which have been told of compacts made with the devil.\r\nI almost felt as if I was standing in the actual presence of one of the\r\npowers of evil. I thought of my love for Marjorie,--which had revealed\r\nitself after all these years; of the delight of holding her in my arms,\r\nof feeling the pressure of her lips to mine. As my gaze met his, the\r\nlower side of what the conquest of this fair lady would mean, burned in\r\nmy brain; fierce imaginings blazed before my eyes. To win her,--only to\r\nwin her!\r\n\r\nWhat nonsense he was talking! What empty brag it was! Suppose, just for\r\nthe sake of the joke, I did put my hand in his, and did wish, right\r\nout, what it was plain he knew. If I wished, what harm would it do! It\r\nwould be the purest jest. Out of his own mouth he would be confounded,\r\nfor it was certain that nothing would come of it. Why should I not do\r\nit then?\r\n\r\nI would act on his suggestion,--I would carry the thing right through.\r\nAlready I was advancing towards him, when--I stopped. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why.\r\nOn the instant, my thoughts went off at a tangent.\r\n\r\nWhat sort of a blackguard did I call myself that I should take a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s name in vain for the sake of playing fool\xe2\x80\x99s tricks with such\r\nscum of the earth as the hideous vagabond in front of me,--and that the\r\nname of the woman whom I loved? Rage took hold of me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You hound!\xe2\x80\x99 I cried.\r\n\r\nIn my sudden passage from one mood to another, I was filled with the\r\ndesire to shake the life half out of him. But so soon as I moved a step\r\nin his direction, intending war instead of peace, he altered the\r\nposition of his hand, holding it out towards me as if forbidding my\r\napproach. Directly he did so, quite involuntarily, I pulled up\r\ndead,--as if my progress had been stayed by bars of iron and walls of\r\nsteel.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, I was astonished to the verge of stupefaction. The\r\nsensation was peculiar. I was as incapable of advancing another inch in\r\nhis direction as if I had lost the use of my limbs,--I was even\r\nincapable of attempting to attempt to advance. At first I could only\r\nstare and gape. Presently I began to have an inkling of what had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nThe scoundrel had almost succeeded in hypnotising me.\r\n\r\nThat was a nice thing to happen to a man of my sort at my time of life.\r\nA shiver went down my back,--what might have occurred if I had not\r\npulled up in time! What pranks might a creature of that character not\r\nhave been disposed to play. It was the old story of the peril of\r\nplaying with edged tools; I had made the dangerous mistake of\r\nunderrating the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s strength. Evidently, in his own line, the\r\nfellow was altogether something out of the usual way.\r\n\r\nI believe that even as it was he thought he had me. As I turned away,\r\nand leaned against the table at my back, I fancy that he shivered,--as\r\nif this proof of my being still my own master was unexpected. I was\r\nsilent,--it took some seconds to enable me to recover from the shock of\r\nthe discovery of the peril in which I had been standing. Then I\r\nresolved that I would endeavour to do something which should make me\r\nequal to this gentleman of many talents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take my advice, my friend, and don\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to play that hankey\r\npankey off on to me again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you talk of.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t lie to me,--or I\xe2\x80\x99ll burn you into ashes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBehind me was an electrical machine, giving an eighteen inch spark. It\r\nwas set in motion by a lever fitted into the table, which I could\r\neasily reach from where I sat. As I spoke the visitor was treated to a\r\nlittle exhibition of electricity. The change in his bearing was\r\namusing. He shook with terror. He salaamed down to the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My lord!--my lord!--have mercy, oh my lord!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you be careful, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. You may suppose yourself to be\r\nsomething of a magician, but it happens, unfortunately for you, that I\r\ncan do a bit in that line myself,--perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99m a trifle better at the\r\ngame than you are. Especially as you have ventured into my stronghold,\r\nwhich contains magic enough to make a show of a hundred thousand such\r\nas you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTaking down a bottle from a shelf, I sprinkled a drop or two of its\r\ncontents on the floor. Immediately flames arose, accompanied by a\r\nblinding vapour. It was a sufficiently simple illustration of one of\r\nthe qualities of phosphorous-bromide, but its effect upon my visitor\r\nwas as startling as it was unexpected. If I could believe the evidence\r\nof my own eyesight, in the very act of giving utterance to a scream of\r\nterror he disappeared, how, or why, or whither, there was nothing to\r\nshow,--in his place, where he had been standing, there seemed to be a\r\ndim object of some sort in a state of frenzied agitation on the floor.\r\nThe phosphorescent vapour was confusing; the lights appeared to be\r\nsuddenly burning low; before I had sense enough to go and see if there\r\nwas anything there, and, if so, what, the flames had vanished, the man\r\nhimself had reappeared, and, prostrated on his knees, was salaaming in\r\na condition of abject terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My lord! my lord!\xe2\x80\x99 he whined. \xe2\x80\x98I entreat you, my lord, to use me as\r\nyour slave!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll use you as my slave!\xe2\x80\x99 Whether he or I was the more agitated it\r\nwould have been difficult to say,--but, at least, it would not have\r\ndone to betray my feelings as he did his. \xe2\x80\x98Stand up!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe stood up. I eyed him as he did with an interest which, so far as I\r\nwas concerned, was of a distinctly new and original sort. Whether or\r\nnot I had been the victim of an ocular delusion I could not be sure. It\r\nwas incredible to suppose that he could have disappeared as he had\r\nseemed to disappear,--it was also incredible that I could have imagined\r\nhis disappearance. If the thing had been a trick, I had not the\r\nfaintest notion how it had been worked; and, if it was not a trick,\r\nthen what was it? Was it something new in scientific marvels? Could he\r\ngive me as much instruction in the qualities of unknown forces as I\r\ncould him?\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile he stood in an attitude of complete submission, with\r\ndowncast eyes, and hands crossed upon his breast. I started to\r\ncross-examine him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am going to ask you some questions. So long as you answer them\r\npromptly, truthfully, you will be safe. Otherwise you had best beware.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ask, oh my lord.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is the nature of your objection to Mr Lessingham?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Revenge.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What has he done to you that you should wish to be revenged on him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is the feud of the innocent blood.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean by that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On his hands is the blood of my kin. It cries aloud for vengeance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who has he killed?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That, my lord, is for me,--and for him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see.--Am I to understand that you do not choose to answer me, and\r\nthat I am again to use my--magic?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI saw that he quivered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My lord, he has spilled the blood of her who has lain upon his breast.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI hesitated. What he meant appeared clear enough. Perhaps it would be\r\nas well not to press for further details. The words pointed to what it\r\nmight be courteous to call an Eastern Romance,--though it was hard to\r\nconceive of the Apostle figuring as the hero of such a theme. It was\r\nthe old tale retold, that to the life of every man there is a\r\nbackground,--that it is precisely in the unlikeliest cases that the\r\nbackground\xe2\x80\x99s darkest. What would that penny-plain-and-twopence-coloured\r\nbogey, the Nonconformist Conscience, make of such a story if it were\r\nblazoned through the land. Would Paul not come down with a run?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cSpilling blood\xe2\x80\x9d is a figure of speech; pretty, perhaps, but vague. If\r\nyou mean that Mr Lessingham has been killing someone, your surest and\r\nmost effectual revenge would be gained by an appeal to the law.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What has the Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s law to do with me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you can prove that he has been guilty of murder it would have a\r\ngreat deal to do with you. I assure you that at any rate, in that\r\nsense, the Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s law is no respecter of persons. Show him to be\r\nguilty, and it would hang Paul Lessingham as indifferently, and as\r\ncheerfully, as it would hang Bill Brown.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is so, as, if you choose, you will be easily able to prove to your\r\nown entire satisfaction.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had raised his head, and was looking at something which he seemed to\r\nsee in front of him with a maleficent glare in his sensitive eyes which\r\nit was not nice to see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He would be shamed?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed he would be shamed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Before all men?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Before all men,--and, I take it, before all women too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And he would hang?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If shown to have been guilty of wilful murder,--yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis hideous face was lighted up by a sort of diabolical exultation\r\nwhich made it, if that were possible, more hideous still. I had\r\napparently given him a wrinkle which pleased him most consummately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps I will do that in the end,--in the end!\xe2\x80\x99 He opened his eyes to\r\ntheir widest limits, then shut them tight,--as if to gloat on the\r\npicture which his fancy painted. Then reopened them. \xe2\x80\x98In the meantime I\r\nwill have vengeance in my own fashion. He knows already that the\r\navenger is upon him,--he has good reason to know it. And through the\r\ndays and the nights the knowledge shall be with him still, and it shall\r\nbe to him as the bitterness of death,--aye, of many deaths. For he will\r\nknow that escape there is none, and that for him there shall be no more\r\nsun in the sky, and that the terror shall be with him by night and by\r\nday, at his rising up and at his lying down, wherever his eyes shall\r\nturn it shall be there,--yet, behold, the sap and the juice of my\r\nvengeance is in this, in that though he shall be very sure that the\r\ndays that are, are as the days of his death, yet shall he know that THE\r\nDEATH, THE GREAT DEATH, is coming--coming--and shall be on him--when I\r\nwill!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe fellow spoke like an inspired maniac. If he meant half what he\r\nsaid,--and if he did not then his looks and his tones belied him!--then\r\na promising future bade fair to be in store for Mr Lessingham,--and,\r\nalso, circumstances being as they were, for Marjorie. It was this\r\nlatter reflection which gave me pause. Either this imprecatory fanatic\r\nwould have to be disposed of, by Lessingham himself, or by someone\r\nacting on his behalf, and, so far as their power of doing mischief\r\nwent, his big words proved empty windbags, or Marjorie would have to be\r\nwarned that there was at least one passage in her suitor\xe2\x80\x99s life, into\r\nwhich, ere it was too late, it was advisable that inquiry should be\r\nmade. To allow Marjorie to irrevocably link her fate with the\r\nApostle\xe2\x80\x99s, without being first of all made aware that he was, to all\r\nintents and purposes, a haunted man--that was not to be thought of.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You employ large phrases.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMy words cooled the other\xe2\x80\x99s heated blood. Once more his eyes were cast\r\ndown, his hands crossed upon his breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I crave my lord\xe2\x80\x99s pardon. My wound is ever new.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By the way, what was the secret history, this morning, of that little\r\nincident of the cockroach?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe glanced up quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cockroach?--I know not what you say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,--was it beetle, then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beetle!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe seemed, all at once, to have lost his voice,--the word was gasped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98After you went we found, upon a sheet of paper, a capitally executed\r\ndrawing of a beetle, which, I fancy, you must have left behind\r\nyou,--_Scarabaeus sacer_, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know not what you talk of.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Its discovery seemed to have quite a singular effect on Mr Lessingham.\r\nNow, why was that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh yes you do,--and, before you go, I mean to know something too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe man was trembling, looking this way and that, showing signs of\r\nmarked discomfiture. That there was something about that ancient\r\nscarab, which figures so largely in the still unravelled tangles of the\r\nEgyptian mythologies, and the effect which the mere sight of its\r\ncartouch--for the drawing had resembled something of the kind--had had\r\non such a seasoned vessel as Paul Lessingham, which might be well worth\r\nmy finding out, I felt convinced,--the man\xe2\x80\x99s demeanour, on my recurring\r\nto the matter, told its own plain tale. I made up my mind, if possible,\r\nto probe the business to the bottom, then and there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Listen to me, my friend. I am a plain man, and I use plain\r\nspeech,--it\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of hobby I have. You will give me the information\r\nI require, and that at once, or I will pit my magic against yours,--in\r\nwhich case I think it extremely probable that you will come off worst\r\nfrom the encounter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI reached out for the lever, and the exhibition of electricity\r\nrecommenced. Immediately his tremors were redoubled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My lord, I know not of what you talk.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98None of your lies for me.--Tell me why, at the sight of the thing on\r\nthat sheet of paper, Paul Lessingham went green and yellow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ask him, my lord.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Probably, later on, that is what I shall do. In the meantime, I am\r\nasking you. Answer,--or look out for squalls.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe electrical exhibition was going on. He was glaring at it as if he\r\nwished that it would stop. As if ashamed of his cowardice, plainly, on\r\na sudden, he made a desperate effort to get the better of his\r\nfears,--and succeeded better than I had expected or desired. He drew\r\nhimself up with what, in him, amounted to an air of dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am a child of Isis!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt struck me that he made this remark, not so much to impress me, as\r\nwith a view of elevating his own low spirits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you?--Then, in that case, I regret that I am unable to\r\ncongratulate the lady on her offspring.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen I said that, a ring came into his voice which I had not heard\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Silence!--You know not of what you speak!--I warn you, as I warned\r\nPaul Lessingham, be careful not to go too far. Be not like him,--heed\r\nmy warning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it I am being warned against,--the beetle?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,--the beetle!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWere I upon oath, and this statement being made, in the presence of\r\nwitnesses, say, in a solicitor\xe2\x80\x99s office, I standing in fear of pains\r\nand penalties, I think that, at this point, I should leave the paper\r\nblank. No man likes to own himself a fool, or that he ever was a\r\nfool,--and ever since I have been wondering whether, on that occasion,\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x98child of Isis\xe2\x80\x99 did, or did not, play the fool with me. His\r\nperformance was realistic enough at the time, heaven knows. But, as it\r\ngets farther and farther away, I ask myself, more and more confidently,\r\nas time effluxes, whether, after all, it was not clever\r\njuggling,--superhumanly clever juggling, if you will; that, and nothing\r\nmore. If it was something more, then, with a vengeance! there is more\r\nin heaven and earth than is dreamed of in our philosophy. The mere\r\npossibility opens vistas which the sane mind fears to contemplate.\r\n\r\nSince, then, I am not on oath, and, should I fall short of verbal\r\naccuracy, I do not need to fear the engines of the law, what seemed to\r\nhappen was this.\r\n\r\nHe was standing within about ten feet of where I leaned against the\r\nedge of the table. The light was full on, so that it was difficult to\r\nsuppose that I could make a mistake as to what took place in front of\r\nme. As he replied to my mocking allusion to the beetle by echoing my\r\nown words, he vanished,--or, rather, I saw him taking a different shape\r\nbefore my eyes. His loose draperies all fell off him, and, as they were\r\nin the very act of falling, there issued, or there seemed to issue out\r\nof them, a monstrous creature of the beetle tribe,--the man himself was\r\ngone. On the point of size I wish to make myself clear. My impression,\r\nwhen I saw it first, was that it was as large as the man had been, and\r\nthat it was, in some way, standing up on end, the legs towards me. But,\r\nthe moment it came in view, it began to dwindle, and that so rapidly\r\nthat, in a couple of seconds at most, a little heap of drapery was\r\nlying on the floor, on which was a truly astonishing example of the\r\ncoleoptera. It appeared to be a beetle. It was, perhaps, six or seven\r\ninches high, and about a foot in length. Its scales were of a vivid\r\ngolden green. I could distinctly see where the wings were sheathed\r\nalong the back, and, as they seemed to be slightly agitated, I looked,\r\nevery moment, to see them opened, and the thing take wing.\r\n\r\nI was so astonished,--as who would not have been?--that for an\r\nappreciable space of time I was practically in a state of stupefaction.\r\nI could do nothing but stare. I was acquainted with the legendary\r\ntransmigrations of Isis, and with the story of the beetle which issues\r\nfrom the woman\xe2\x80\x99s womb through all eternity, and with the other pretty\r\ntales, but this, of which I was an actual spectator, was something new,\r\neven in legends. If the man, with whom I had just been speaking, was\r\ngone, where had he gone to? If this glittering creature was there, in\r\nhis stead, whence had it come?\r\n\r\nI do protest this much, that, after the first shock of surprise had\r\npassed, I retained my presence of mind. I felt as an investigator might\r\nfeel, who has stumbled, haphazard, on some astounding, some\r\nepoch-making, discovery. I was conscious that I should have to make the\r\nbest use of my mental faculties if I was to take full advantage of so\r\nastonishing an accident. I kept my glance riveted on the creature, with\r\nthe idea of photographing it on my brain. I believe that if it were\r\npossible to take a retinal print--which it some day will be--you would\r\nhave a perfect picture of what it was I saw. Beyond doubt it was a\r\nlamellicorn, one of the _copridae_. With the one exception of its\r\nmonstrous size, there were the characteristics in plain view;--the\r\nconvex body, the large head, the projecting clypeus. More, its smooth\r\nhead and throat seemed to suggest that it was a female. Equally beyond\r\na doubt, apart from its size, there were unusual features present too.\r\nThe eyes were not only unwontedly conspicuous, they gleamed as if they\r\nwere lighted by internal flames,--in some indescribable fashion they\r\nreminded me of my vanished visitor. The colouring was superb, and the\r\ncreature appeared to have the chameleonlike faculty of lightening and\r\ndarkening the shades at will. Its not least curious feature was its\r\nrestlessness. It was in a state of continual agitation; and, as if it\r\nresented my inspection, the more I looked at it the more its agitation\r\ngrew. As I have said, I expected every moment to see it take wing and\r\ncircle through the air.\r\n\r\nAll the while I was casting about in my mind as to what means I could\r\nuse to effect its capture. I did think of killing it, and, on the\r\nwhole, I rather wish that I had at any rate attempted slaughter,--there\r\nwere dozens of things, lying ready to my hand, any one of which would\r\nhave severely tried its constitution;--but, on the spur of the moment,\r\nthe only method of taking it alive which occurred to me, was to pop\r\nover it a big tin canister which had contained soda-lime. This canister\r\nwas on the floor to my left. I moved towards it, as nonchalantly as I\r\ncould, keeping an eye on that shining wonder all the time. Directly I\r\nmoved, its agitation perceptibly increased,--it was, so to speak, all\r\none whirr of tremblement; it scintillated, as if its coloured scales\r\nhad been so many prisms; it began to unsheath its wings, as if it had\r\nfinally decided that it would make use of them. Picking up the tin,\r\ndisembarrassing it of its lid, I sprang towards my intended victim. Its\r\nwings opened wide; obviously it was about to rise; but it was too late.\r\nBefore it had cleared the ground, the tin was over it.\r\n\r\nIt remained over it, however, for an instant only. I had stumbled, in\r\nmy haste, and, in my effort to save myself from falling face foremost\r\non to the floor, I was compelled to remove my hands from the tin.\r\nBefore I was able to replace them, the tin was sent flying, and, while\r\nI was still partially recumbent, within eighteen inches of me, that\r\nbeetle swelled and swelled, until it had assumed its former portentous\r\ndimensions, when, as it seemed, it was enveloped by a human shape, and\r\nin less time than no time, there stood in front of me, naked from top\r\nto toe, my truly versatile oriental friend. One startling fact nudity\r\nrevealed,--that I had been egregiously mistaken on the question of sex.\r\nMy visitor was not a man, but a woman, and, judging from the brief\r\nglimpse which I had of her body, by no means old or ill-shaped either.\r\n\r\nIf that transformation was not a bewildering one, then two and two make\r\nfive. The most level-headed scientist would temporarily have lost his\r\nmental equipoise on witnessing such a quick change as that within a\r\nspan or two of his own nose I was not only witless, I was breathless\r\ntoo,--I could only gape. And, while I gaped, the woman, stooping down,\r\npicking up her draperies, began to huddle them on her anyhow,--and,\r\nalso, to skedaddle towards the door which led into the yard. When I\r\nobserved this last manoeuvre, to some extent I did rise to the\r\nrequirements of the situation. Leaping up, I rushed to stay her flight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop!\xe2\x80\x99 I shouted.\r\n\r\nBut she was too quick for me. Ere I could reach her, she had opened the\r\ndoor, and was through it,--and, what was more, she had slammed it in my\r\nface. In my excitement, I did some fumbling with the handle. When, in\r\nmy turn, I was in the yard, she was out of sight. I did fancy I saw a\r\ndim form disappearing over the wall at the further side, and I made for\r\nit as fast as I knew how. I clambered on to the wall, looking this way\r\nand that, but there was nothing and no one to be seen. I listened for\r\nthe sound of retreating footsteps, but all was still. Apparently I had\r\nthe entire neighbourhood to my own sweet self. My visitor had vanished.\r\nTime devoted to pursuit I felt would be time ill-spent.\r\n\r\nAs I returned across the yard, Woodville, who still was taking his rest\r\nunder the open canopy of heaven, sat up. Seemingly my approach had\r\nroused him out of slumber. At sight of me he rubbed his eyes, and\r\nyawned, and blinked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say,\xe2\x80\x99 he remarked, not at all unreasonably, \xe2\x80\x98where am I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re on holy--or on haunted ground,--hang me if I quite know\r\nwhich!--but that\xe2\x80\x99s where you are, my boy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By Jove!--I am feeling queer!--I have got a headache, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in the least surprised at anything you have, or\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t,--I\xe2\x80\x99m beyond surprise. It\xe2\x80\x99s a drop of whisky you are\r\nwanting,--and what I\xe2\x80\x99m wanting too,--only, for goodness sake, drop me\r\nnone of your drops! Mine is a case for a bottle at the least.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI put my arm through his, and went with him into the laboratory. And,\r\nwhen we were in, I shut, and locked, and barred the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XIX.\r\n THE LADY RAGES\r\n\r\nDora Grayling stood in the doorway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I told your servant he need not trouble to show me in,--and I\xe2\x80\x99ve come\r\nwithout my aunt. I hope I\xe2\x80\x99m not intruding.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was--confoundedly; and it was on the tip of my tongue to tell her\r\nso. She came into the room, with twinkling eyes, looking radiantly\r\nhappy,--that sort of look which makes even a plain young woman\r\nprepossessing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Am I intruding?--I believe I am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand, while she was still a dozen feet away, and when\r\nI did not at once dash forward to make a clutch at it, she shook her\r\nhead and made a little mouth at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you?--Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI was not well,--I was very far from well. I was as unwell as I could\r\nbe without being positively ill, and any person of common discernment\r\nwould have perceived it at a glance. At the same time I was not going\r\nto admit anything of the kind to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you,--I am perfectly well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then, if I were you, I would endeavour to become imperfectly well; a\r\nlittle imperfection in that direction might make you appear to more\r\nadvantage.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid that that I am not one of those persons who ever do appear\r\nto much advantage,--did I not tell you so last night?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe you did say something of the kind,--it\xe2\x80\x99s very good of you to\r\nremember. Have you forgotten something else which you said to me last\r\nnight?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can hardly expect me to keep fresh in my memory all the follies of\r\nwhich my tongue is guilty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you.--That is quite enough.--Good-day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe turned as if to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Grayling!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Atherton?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?--What have I been saying now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Last night you invited me to come and see you this morning,--is that\r\none of the follies of which your tongue was guilty?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe engagement had escaped my recollection--it is a fact!--and my face\r\nbetrayed me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You had forgotten?\xe2\x80\x99 Her cheeks flamed; her eyes sparkled. \xe2\x80\x98You must\r\npardon my stupidity for not having understood that the invitation was\r\nof that general kind which is never meant to be acted on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was half way to the door before I stopped her,--I had to take her\r\nby the shoulder to do it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Grayling!--You are hard on me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose I am.--Is anything harder than to be intruded on by an\r\nundesired, and unexpected, guest?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now you are harder still.--If you knew what I have gone through since\r\nour conversation of last night, in your strength you would be merciful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed?--What have you gone through?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI hesitated. What I actually had gone through I certainly did not\r\npropose to tell her. Other reasons apart I did not desire to seem\r\nmadder than I admittedly am,--and I lacked sufficient plausibility to\r\nenable me to concoct, on the spur of the moment, a plain tale of the\r\ndoings of my midnight visitor which would have suggested that the\r\nnarrator was perfectly sane. So I fenced,--or tried to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For one thing,--I have had no sleep.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI had not,--not one single wink. When I did get between the sheets,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98all night I lay in agony,\xe2\x80\x99 I suffered from that worst form of\r\nnightmare,--the nightmare of the man who is wide awake. There was\r\ncontinually before my fevered eyes the strange figure of that Nameless\r\nThing. I had often smiled at tales of haunted folk,--here was I one of\r\nthem. My feelings were not rendered more agreeable by a strengthening\r\nconviction that if I had only retained the normal attitude of a\r\nscientific observer I should, in all probability, have solved the\r\nmystery of my oriental friend, and that his example of the genus of\r\n_copridae_ might have been pinned,--by a very large pin!--on a piece--a\r\nmonstrous piece!--of cork. It was galling to reflect that he and I had\r\nplayed together a game of bluff,--a game at which civilisation was once\r\nmore proved to be a failure.\r\n\r\nShe could not have seen all this in my face; but she saw\r\nsomething--because her own look softened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You do look tired.\xe2\x80\x99 She seemed to be casting about in her own mind for\r\na cause. \xe2\x80\x98You have been worrying.\xe2\x80\x99 She glanced round the big\r\nlaboratory. \xe2\x80\x98Have you been spending the night in this--wizard\xe2\x80\x99s cave?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pretty well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe monosyllable, as she uttered it, was big with meaning. Uninvited,\r\nshe seated herself in an arm-chair, a huge old thing, of shagreen\r\nleather, which would have held half a dozen of her. Demure in it she\r\nlooked, like an agreeable reminiscence, alive, and a little up-to-date,\r\nof the women of long ago. Her dove grey eyes seemed to perceive so much\r\nmore than they cared to show.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How is it that you have forgotten that you asked me to come?--didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou mean it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course I meant it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then how is it you\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t forget.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell fibs.--Something is the matter,--tell me what it is.--Is it\r\nthat I am too early?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing of the sort,--you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too early.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you.--When you pay a compliment, even so neat an one as that,\r\nsometimes, you should look as if you meant it.--It is early,--I know\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s early, but afterwards I want you to come to lunch. I told aunt\r\nthat I would bring you back with me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are much better to me than I deserve.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps.\xe2\x80\x99 A tone came into her voice which was almost pathetic. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nthink that to some men women are almost better than they deserve. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know why. I suppose it pleases them. It is odd.\xe2\x80\x99 There was a\r\ndifferent intonation,--a dryness. \xe2\x80\x98Have you forgotten what I came for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a bit of it,--I am not quite the brute I seem. You came to see an\r\nillustration of that pleasant little fancy of mine for slaughtering my\r\nfellows. The fact is, I\xe2\x80\x99m hardly in a mood for that just now,--I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen illustrating it too much already.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, for one thing it\xe2\x80\x99s been murdering Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s cat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s cat?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then it almost murdered Percy Woodville.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Atherton!--I wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk like that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a fact. It was a question of a little matter in a wrong place,\r\nand, if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for something very like a miracle, he\xe2\x80\x99d be dead.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to do with such things--I hate them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI stared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hate them?--I thought you\xe2\x80\x99d come to see an illustration.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And pray what was your notion of an illustration?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, another cat would have had to be killed, at least.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And do you suppose that I would have sat still while a cat was being\r\nkilled for my--edification?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It needn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily have been a cat, but something would have had\r\nto be killed,--how are you going to illustrate the death-dealing\r\npropensities of a weapon of that sort without it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it possible that you imagine that I came here to see something\r\nkilled?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then for what did you come?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI do not know what there was about the question which was startling,\r\nbut as soon as it was out, she went a fiery red.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because I was a fool.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI was bewildered. Either she had got out of the wrong side of bed, or I\r\nhad,--or we both had. Here she was, assailing me, hammer and tongs, so\r\nfar as I could see, for absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are pleased to be satirical at my expense.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should not dare. Your detection of me would be so painfully rapid.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI was in no mood for jangling. I turned a little away from her.\r\nImmediately she was at my elbow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Atherton?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Grayling.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you cross with me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why should I be? If it pleases you to laugh at my stupidity you are\r\ncompletely justified.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you are not stupid.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No?--Nor you satirical.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are not stupid,--you know you are not stupid; it was only\r\nstupidity on my part to pretend that you were.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is very good of you to say so.--But I fear that I am an indifferent\r\nhost. Although you would not care for an illustration, there may be\r\nother things which you might find amusing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why do you keep on snubbing me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I keep on snubbing you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are always snubbing me,--you know you are. Some times I feel as if\r\nI hated you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Grayling!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do! I do! I do!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98After all, it is only natural.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is how you talk,--as if I were a child, and you were,--oh I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what.--Well, Mr Atherton, I am sorry to be obliged to leave you. I\r\nhave enjoyed my visit very much. I only hope I have not seemed too\r\nintrusive.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe flounced--\xe2\x80\x98flounce\xe2\x80\x99 was the only appropriate word!--out of the room\r\nbefore I could stop her. I caught her in the passage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Grayling, I entreat you--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray do not entreat me, Mr Atherton.\xe2\x80\x99 Standing still she turned to me.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would rather show myself to the door as I showed myself in, but, if\r\nthat is impossible, might I ask you not to speak to me between this and\r\nthe street?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe hint was broad enough, even for me. I escorted her through the hall\r\nwithout a word,--in perfect silence she shook the dust of my abode from\r\noff her feet.\r\n\r\nI had made a pretty mess of things. I felt it as I stood on the top of\r\nthe steps and watched her going,--she was walking off at four miles an\r\nhour; I had not even ventured to ask to be allowed to call a hansom.\r\n\r\nIt was beginning to occur to me that this was a case in which another\r\nblow upon the river might be, to say the least of it, advisable--and I\r\nwas just returning into the house with the intention of putting myself\r\ninto my flannels, when a cab drew up, and old Lindon got out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XX.\r\n A HEAVY FATHER\r\n\r\nMr Lindon was excited,--there is no mistaking it when he is, because\r\nwith him excitement means perspiration, and as soon as he was out of\r\nthe cab he took off his hat and began to wipe the lining.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Atherton, I want to speak to you--most particularly--somewhere in\r\nprivate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI took him into my laboratory. It is my rule to take no one there; it\r\nis a workshop, not a playroom,--the place is private; but, recently, my\r\nrules had become dead letters. Directly he was inside, Lindon began\r\npuffing and stewing, wiping his forehead, throwing out his chest, as if\r\nhe were oppressed by a sense of his own importance. Then he started off\r\ntalking at the top of his voice,--and it is not a low one either.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Atherton, I--I\xe2\x80\x99ve always looked on you as a--a kind of a son.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s very kind of you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve always regarded you as a--a level-headed fellow; a man from whom\r\nsound advice can be obtained when sound advice--is--is most to be\r\ndesired.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That also is very kind of you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And therefore I make no apology for coming to you at--at what may be\r\nregarded as a--a strictly domestic crisis; at a moment in the history\r\nof the Lindons when delicacy and common sense are--are essentially\r\nrequired.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis time I contented myself with nodding. Already I perceived what was\r\ncoming; somehow, when I am with a man I feel so much more clear-headed\r\nthan I do when I am with a woman,--realise so much better the nature of\r\nthe ground on which I am standing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you know of this man Lessingham?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI knew it was coming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What all the world knows.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what does all the world know of him?--I ask you that! A flashy,\r\nplausible, shallow-pated, carpet-bagger,--that is what all the world\r\nknows of him. The man\xe2\x80\x99s a political adventurer,--he snatches a\r\nprecarious, and criminal, notoriety, by trading on the follies of his\r\nfellow-countrymen. He is devoid of decency, destitute of principle, and\r\nimpervious to all the feelings of a gentleman. What do you know of him\r\nbesides this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not prepared to admit that I do know that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh yes you do!--don\xe2\x80\x99t talk nonsense!--you choose to screen the fellow!\r\nI say what I mean,--I always have said, and I always shall say.--What\r\ndo you know of him outside politics,--of his family--of his private\r\nlife?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,--not very much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course you don\xe2\x80\x99t!--nor does anybody else! The man\xe2\x80\x99s a mushroom,--or\r\na toadstool, rather!--sprung up in the course of a single night,\r\napparently out of some dirty ditch.--Why, sir, not only is he without\r\nordinary intelligence, he is even without a Brummagen substitute for\r\nmanners.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had worked himself into a state of heat in which his countenance\r\npresented a not too agreeable assortment of scarlets and purples. He\r\nflung himself into a chair, threw his coat wide open, and his arms too,\r\nand started off again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The family of the Lindons is, at this moment, represented by a--a\r\nyoung woman,--by my daughter, sir. She represents me, and it\xe2\x80\x99s her duty\r\nto represent me adequately--adequately, sir! And what\xe2\x80\x99s more, between\r\nourselves, sir, it\xe2\x80\x99s her duty to marry. My property\xe2\x80\x99s my own, and I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have it pass to either of my confounded brothers on any\r\naccount. They\xe2\x80\x99re next door to fools, and--and they don\xe2\x80\x99t represent me\r\nin any possible sense of the word. My daughter, sir, can marry whom she\r\npleases,--whom she pleases! There\xe2\x80\x99s no one in England, peer or\r\ncommoner, who would not esteem it an honour to have her for his\r\nwife--I\xe2\x80\x99ve told her so,--yes, sir, I\xe2\x80\x99ve told her, though you--you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nthink that she, of all people in the world, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t require telling.\r\nYet what do you think she does? She--she actually carries on what I--I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t help calling a--a compromising acquaintance with this man\r\nLessingham!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I say yes!--and I wish to heaven I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I--I\xe2\x80\x99ve warned her\r\nagainst the scoundrel more than once; I--I\xe2\x80\x99ve told her to cut him dead.\r\nAnd yet, as--as you saw yourself, last night, in--in the face of the\r\nassembled House of Commons, after that twaddling clap-trap speech of\r\nhis, in which there was not one sound sentiment, nor an idea\r\nwhich--which would hold water, she positively went away with him,\r\nin--in the most ostentatious and--and disgraceful fashion, on--on his\r\narm, and--and actually snubbed her father.--It is monstrous that a\r\nparent--a father!--should be subjected to such treatment by his child.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe poor old boy polished his brow with his pocket-handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When I got home I--I told her what I thought of her, I promise you\r\nthat,--and I told her what I thought of him,--I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mince my words\r\nwith her. There are occasions when plain speaking is demanded,--and\r\nthat was one. I positively forbade her to speak to the fellow again, or\r\nto recognise him if she met him in the street. I pointed out to her,\r\nwith perfect candour, that the fellow was an infernal scoundrel,--that\r\nand nothing else!--and that he would bring disgrace on whoever came\r\ninto contact with him, even with the end of a barge pole.--And what do\r\nyou think she said?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She promised to obey you, I make no doubt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did she, sir!--By gad, did she!--That shows how much you know\r\nher!--She said, and, by gad, by her manner, and--and the way she went\r\non, you\xe2\x80\x99d--you\xe2\x80\x99d have thought that she was the parent and I was the\r\nchild--she said that I--I grieved her, that she was disappointed in me,\r\nthat times have changed,--yes, sir, she said that times have\r\nchanged!--that, nowadays, parents weren\xe2\x80\x99t Russian autocrats--no, sir,\r\nnot Russian autocrats!--that--that she was sorry she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t oblige\r\nme,--yes, sir, that was how she put it,--she was sorry she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\noblige me, but it was altogether out of the question to suppose that\r\nshe could put a period to a friendship which she valued, simply on\r\naccount of--of my unreasonable prejudices,--and--and--and, in short,\r\nshe--she told me to go the devil, sir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And did you--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI was on the point of asking him if he went,--but I checked myself in\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let us look at the matter as men of the world. What do you know\r\nagainst Lessingham, apart from his politics?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s just it,--I know nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In a sense, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that in his favour?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how you make that out. I--I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind telling you that\r\nI--I\xe2\x80\x99ve had inquiries made. He\xe2\x80\x99s not been in the House six years--this\r\nis his second Parliament--he\xe2\x80\x99s jumped up like a Jack-in-the-box. His\r\nfirst constituency was Harwich--they\xe2\x80\x99ve got him still, and much good\r\nmay he do \xe2\x80\x99em!--but how he came to stand for the place,--or who, or\r\nwhat, or where he was before he stood for the place, no one seems to\r\nhave the faintest notion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he been a great traveller?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never heard of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not in the East?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has he told you so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,--I was only wondering. Well, it seems to me that to find out that\r\nnothing is known against him is something in his favour!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Sydney, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk nonsense. What it proves is simply,--that\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s a nothing and a nobody. Had he been anything or anyone, something\r\nwould have been known about him, either for or against. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want my\r\ndaughter to marry a man who--who--who\xe2\x80\x99s shot up through a trap, simply\r\nbecause nothing is known against him. Ha-hang me, if I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ten\r\ntimes sooner she should marry you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen he said that, my heart leaped in my bosom. I had to turn away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid that is out of the question.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe stopped in his tramping, and looked at me askance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI felt that, if I was not careful, I should be done for,--and,\r\nprobably, in his present mood, Marjorie too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Lindon, I cannot tell you how grateful I am to you for your\r\nsuggestion, but I can only repeat that--unfortunately, anything of the\r\nkind is out of the question.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You--you\xe2\x80\x99re a pretty lot, upon my word!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid we are.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I--I want you to tell her that Lessingham is a damned scoundrel.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see.--But I would suggest that if I am to use the influence with\r\nwhich you credit me to the best advantage, or to preserve a shred of\r\nit, I had hardly better state the fact quite so bluntly as that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t care how you state it,--state it as you like. Only--only I\r\nwant you to soak her mind with a loathing of the fellow; I--I--I want\r\nyou to paint him in his true colours; in--in--in fact, I--I want you to\r\nchoke him off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhile he still struggled with his words, and with the perspiration on\r\nhis brow, Edwards entered. I turned to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Lindon, sir, wishes to see you particularly, and at once.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt that moment I found the announcement a trifle perplexing,--it\r\ndelighted Lindon. He began to stutter and to stammer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98T-the very thing!--c-couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been better!--show her in here!\r\nH-hide me somewhere,--I don\xe2\x80\x99t care where,--behind that screen! Y-you\r\nuse your influence with her;--g-give her a good talking to;--t-tell her\r\nwhat I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you; and at--at the critical moment I\xe2\x80\x99ll come in, and\r\nthen--then if we can\xe2\x80\x99t manage her between us, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a wonder.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe proposition staggered me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, my dear Mr Lindon, I fear that I cannot--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe cut me short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here she comes!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEre I could stop him he was behind the screen,--I had not seen him move\r\nwith such agility before!--and before I could expostulate Marjorie was\r\nin the room. Something which was in her bearing, in her face, in her\r\neyes, quickened the beating of my pulses,--she looked as if something\r\nhad come into her life, and taken the joy clean out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXI.\r\n THE TERROR IN THE NIGHT\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sydney!\xe2\x80\x99 she cried, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad that I can see you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe might be,--but, at that moment, I could scarcely assert that I was\r\na sharer of her joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I told you that if trouble overtook me I should come to you, and--I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nin trouble now. Such strange trouble.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo was I,--and in perplexity as well. An idea occurred to me,--I would\r\noutwit her eavesdropping father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come with me into the house,--tell me all about it there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe refused to budge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,--I will tell you all about it here.\xe2\x80\x99 She looked about her,--as it\r\nstruck me queerly. \xe2\x80\x98This is just the sort of place in which to unfold a\r\ntale like mine. It looks uncanny.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cBut me no buts!\xe2\x80\x9d Sydney, don\xe2\x80\x99t torture me,--let me stop here where I\r\nam,--don\xe2\x80\x99t you see I\xe2\x80\x99m haunted?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe had seated herself. Now she stood up, holding her hands out in\r\nfront of her in a state of extraordinary agitation, her manner as wild\r\nas her words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why are you staring at me like that? Do you think I\xe2\x80\x99m mad?--I wonder\r\nif I\xe2\x80\x99m going mad.--Sydney, do people suddenly go mad? You\xe2\x80\x99re a bit of\r\neverything, you\xe2\x80\x99re a bit of a doctor too, feel my pulse,--there it\r\nis!--tell me if I\xe2\x80\x99m ill!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI felt her pulse,--it did not need its swift beating to inform me that\r\nfever of some sort was in her veins. I gave her something in a glass.\r\nShe held it up to the level of her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a decoction of my own. You might not think it, but my brain\r\nsometimes gets into a whirl. I use it as a sedative. It will do you\r\ngood.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe drained the glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s done me good already,--I believe it has; that\xe2\x80\x99s being something\r\nlike a doctor.--Well, Sydney, the storm has almost burst. Last night\r\npapa forbade me to speak to Paul Lessingham--by way of a prelude.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Exactly. Mr Lindon--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Mr Lindon,--that\xe2\x80\x99s papa. I fancy we almost quarrelled. I know\r\npapa said some surprising things,--but it\xe2\x80\x99s a way he has,--he\xe2\x80\x99s apt to\r\nsay surprising things. He\xe2\x80\x99s the best father in the world, but--it\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nin his nature to like a really clever person; your good high dried old\r\nTory never can;--I\xe2\x80\x99ve always thought that that\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s so fond of\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you. I presume that is the reason, though it had not occurred to\r\nme before.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSince her entry, I had, to the best of my ability, been turning the\r\nposition over in my mind. I came to the conclusion that, all things\r\nconsidered, her father had probably as much right to be a sharer of his\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s confidence as I had, even from the vantage of the\r\nscreen,--and that for him to hear a few home truths proceeding from her\r\nlips might serve to clear the air. From such a clearance the lady would\r\nnot be likely to come off worst. I had not the faintest inkling of what\r\nwas the actual purport of her visit.\r\n\r\nShe started off, as it seemed to me, at a tangent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did I tell you last night about what took place yesterday\r\nmorning,--about the adventure of my finding the man?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a word.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe I meant to,--I\xe2\x80\x99m half disposed to think he\xe2\x80\x99s brought me\r\ntrouble. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there some superstition about evil befalling whoever\r\nshelters a homeless stranger?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll hope not, for humanity\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I fancy there is,--I feel sure there is.--Anyhow, listen to my story.\r\nYesterday morning, before breakfast,--to be accurate, between eight and\r\nnine, I looked out of the window, and I saw a crowd in the street. I\r\nsent Peter out to see what was the matter. He came back and said there\r\nwas a man in a fit. I went out to look at the man in the fit. I found,\r\nlying on the ground, in the centre of the crowd, a man who, but for the\r\ntattered remnants of what had apparently once been a cloak, would have\r\nbeen stark naked. He was covered with dust, and dirt, and blood,--a\r\ndreadful sight. As you know, I have had my smattering of instruction in\r\nFirst Aid to the Injured, and that kind of thing, so, as no one else\r\nseemed to have any sense, and the man seemed as good as dead, I thought\r\nI would try my hand. Directly I knelt down beside him, what do you\r\nthink he said?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n [IMAGE: images/img_155.jpg\r\n CAPTION: I WENT OUT TO LOOK AT THE MAN.]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense.--He said, in such a queer, hollow, croaking voice, \xe2\x80\x9cPaul\r\nLessingham.\xe2\x80\x9d I was dreadfully startled. To hear a perfect stranger, a\r\nman in his condition, utter that name in such a fashion--to me, of all\r\npeople in the world!--took me aback. The policeman who was holding his\r\nhead remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the first time he\xe2\x80\x99s opened his mouth. I thought\r\nhe was dead.\xe2\x80\x9d He opened his mouth a second time. A convulsive movement\r\nwent all over him, and he exclaimed, with the strangest earnestness,\r\nand so loudly that you might have heard him at the other end of the\r\nstreet, \xe2\x80\x9cBe warned, Paul Lessingham, be warned!\xe2\x80\x9d It was very silly of\r\nme, perhaps, but I cannot tell you how his words, and his manner--the\r\ntwo together--affected me.--Well, the long and the short of it was,\r\nthat I had him taken into the house, and washed, and put to bed,--and I\r\nhad the doctor sent for. The doctor could make nothing of it at all. He\r\nreported that the man seemed to be suffering from some sort of\r\ncataleptic seizure,--I could see that he thought it likely to turn out\r\nalmost as interesting a case as I did.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you acquaint your father with the addition to his household?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe looked at me, quizzically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You see, when one has such a father as mine one cannot tell him\r\neverything, at once. There are occasions on which one requires time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI felt that this would be wholesome hearing for old Lindon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Last night, after papa and I had exchanged our little\r\ncourtesies,--which, it is to be hoped, were to papa\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction,\r\nsince they were not to be mine--I went to see the patient. I was told\r\nthat he had neither eaten nor drunk, moved nor spoken. But, so soon as\r\nI approached his bed, he showed signs of agitation. He half raised\r\nhimself upon his pillow, and he called out, as if he had been\r\naddressing some large assembly--I can\xe2\x80\x99t describe to you the dreadful\r\nsomething which was in his voice, and on his face,--\xe2\x80\x9cPaul\r\nLessingham!--Beware!--The Beetle!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen she said that, I was startled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you sure those were the words he used?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite sure. Do you think I could mistake them,--especially after what\r\nhas happened since? I hear them singing in my ears,--they haunt me all\r\nthe time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe put her hands up to her face, as if to veil something from her\r\neyes. I was becoming more and more convinced that there was something\r\nabout the Apostle\xe2\x80\x99s connection with his Oriental friend which needed\r\nprobing to the bottom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What sort of a man is he to look at, this patient of yours?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI had my doubts as to the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s identity,--which her words\r\ndissolved; only, however, to increase my mystification in another\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He seems to be between thirty and forty. He has light hair, and\r\nstraggling sandy whiskers. He is so thin as to be nothing but skin and\r\nbone,--the doctor says it\xe2\x80\x99s a case of starvation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You say he has light hair, and sandy whiskers. Are you sure the\r\nwhiskers are real?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe opened her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course they\xe2\x80\x99re real. Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they be real?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Does he strike you as being a--foreigner?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not. He looks like an Englishman, and he speaks like one,\r\nand not, I should say, of the lowest class. It is true that there is a\r\nvery curious, a weird, quality in his voice, what I have heard of it,\r\nbut it is not un-English. If it is catalepsy he is suffering from, then\r\nit is a kind of catalepsy I never heard of. Have you ever seen a\r\nclairvoyant?\xe2\x80\x99 I nodded. \xe2\x80\x98He seems to me to be in a state of\r\nclairvoyance. Of course the doctor laughed when I told him so, but we\r\nknow what doctors are, and I still believe that he is in some condition\r\nof the kind. When he said that last night he struck me as being under\r\nwhat those sort of people call \xe2\x80\x9cinfluence,\xe2\x80\x9d and that whoever had him\r\nunder influence was forcing him to speak against his will, for the\r\nwords came from his lips as if they had been wrung from him in agony.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nKnowing what I did know, that struck me as being rather a remarkable\r\nconclusion for her to have reached, by the exercise of her own unaided\r\npowers of intuition,--but I did not choose to let her know I thought so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Marjorie!--you who pride yourself on having your imagination\r\nso strictly under control!--on suffering it to take no errant flights!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is not the fact that I do so pride myself proof that I am not likely\r\nto make assertions wildly,--proof, at any rate, to you? Listen to me.\r\nWhen I left that unfortunate creature\xe2\x80\x99s room,--I had had a nurse sent\r\nfor, I left him in her charge--and reached my own bedroom, I was\r\npossessed by a profound conviction that some appalling, intangible, but\r\nvery real danger, was at that moment threatening Paul.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Remember,--you had had an exciting evening; and a discussion with your\r\nfather. Your patient\xe2\x80\x99s words came as a climax.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is what I told myself,--or, rather, that was what I tried to tell\r\nmyself; because, in some extraordinary fashion, I had lost the command\r\nof my powers of reflection.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Precisely.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was not precisely,--or, at least, it was not precisely in the sense\r\nyou mean. You may laugh at me, Sydney, but I had an altogether\r\nindescribable feeling, a feeling which amounted to knowledge, that I\r\nwas in the presence of the supernatural.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was not nonsense,--I wish it had been nonsense. As I have said, I\r\nwas conscious, completely conscious, that some frightful peril was\r\nassailing Paul. I did not know what it was, but I did know that it was\r\nsomething altogether awful, of which merely to think was to shudder. I\r\nwanted to go to his assistance, I tried to, more than once; but I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, and I knew that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t,--I knew that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t move as\r\nmuch as a finger to help him.--Stop,--let me finish!--I told myself\r\nthat it was absurd, but it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do; absurd or not, there was the\r\nterror with me in the room. I knelt down, and I prayed, but the words\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come. I tried to ask God to remove this burden from my brain,\r\nbut my longings wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t shape themselves into words, and my tongue was\r\npalsied. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long I struggled, but, at last, I came to\r\nunderstand that, for some cause, God had chosen to leave me to fight\r\nthe fight alone. So I got up, and undressed, and went to bed,--and that\r\nwas the worst of all. I had sent my maid away in the first rush of my\r\nterror, afraid, and, I think, ashamed, to let her see my fear. Now I\r\nwould have given anything to summon her back again, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nit, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even ring the bell. So, as I say, I got into bed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe paused, as if to collect her thoughts. To listen to her words, and\r\nto think of the suffering which they meant to her, was almost more than\r\nI could endure. I would have thrown away the world to have been able to\r\ntake her in my arms, and soothe her fears. I knew her to be, in\r\ngeneral, the least hysterical of young women; little wont to become the\r\nprey of mere delusions; and, incredible though it sounded, I had an\r\ninnate conviction that, even in its wildest periods, her story had some\r\nsort of basis in solid fact. What that basis amounted to, it would be\r\nmy business, at any and every cost, quickly to determine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know how you have always laughed at me because of my objection\r\nto--cockroaches, and how, in spring, the neighbourhood of May-bugs has\r\nalways made me uneasy. As soon as I got into bed I felt that something\r\nof the kind was in the room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Something of what kind?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Some kind of--beetle. I could hear the whirring of its wings; I could\r\nhear its droning in the air; I knew that it was hovering above my head;\r\nthat it was coming lower and lower, nearer and nearer. I hid myself; I\r\ncovered myself all over with the clothes,--then I felt it bumping\r\nagainst the coverlet. And, Sydney!\xe2\x80\x99 She drew closer. Her blanched\r\ncheeks and frightened eyes made my heart bleed. Her voice became but an\r\necho of itself. \xe2\x80\x98It followed me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Marjorie!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It got into the bed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You imagined it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine it. I heard it crawl along the sheets, till it found\r\na way between them, and then it crawled towards me. And I felt\r\nit--against my face.--And it\xe2\x80\x99s there now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe raised the forefinger of her left hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There!--Can\xe2\x80\x99t you hear it droning?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe listened, intently. I listened too. Oddly enough, at that instant\r\nthe droning of an insect did become audible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s only a bee, child, which has found its way through the open\r\nwindow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish it were only a bee, I wish it were.--Sydney, don\xe2\x80\x99t you feel as\r\nif you were in the presence of evil? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you want to get away from\r\nit, back into the presence of God?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Marjorie!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray, Sydney, pray!--I can\xe2\x80\x99t!--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe flung her arms about my neck, and pressed herself against me in\r\nparoxysmal agitation. The violence of her emotion bade fair to unman me\r\ntoo. It was so unlike Marjorie,--and I would have given my life to save\r\nher from a toothache. She kept repeating her own words,--as if she\r\ncould not help it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray, Sydney, pray!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt last I did as she wished me. At least, there is no harm in\r\npraying,--I never heard of its bringing hurt to anyone. I repeated\r\naloud the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Prayer,--the first time for I know not how long. As\r\nthe divine sentences came from my lips, hesitatingly enough, I make no\r\ndoubt, her tremors ceased. She became calmer. Until, as I reached the\r\nlast great petition, \xe2\x80\x98Deliver us from evil,\xe2\x80\x99 she loosed her arms from\r\nabout my neck, and dropped upon her knees, close to my feet. And she\r\njoined me in the closing words, as a sort of chorus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For Thine is the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory, for ever and ever.\r\nAmen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen the prayer was ended, we both of us were still. She with her head\r\nbowed, and her hands clasped; and I with something tugging at my\r\nheart-strings which I had not felt there for many and many a year,\r\nalmost as if it had been my mother\xe2\x80\x99s hand;--I daresay that sometimes\r\nshe does stretch out her hand, from her place among the angels, to\r\ntouch my heart-strings, and I know nothing of it all the while.\r\n\r\nAs the silence still continued, I chanced to glance up, and there was\r\nold Lindon peeping at us from his hiding-place behind the screen. The\r\nlook of amazed perplexity which was on his big red face struck me with\r\nsuch a keen sense of the incongruous that it was all I could do to keep\r\nfrom laughter. Apparently the sight of us did nothing to lighten the fog\r\nwhich was in his brain, for he stammered out, in what was possibly\r\nintended for a whisper,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is--is she m-mad?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe whisper,--if it was meant for a whisper--was more than sufficiently\r\naudible to catch his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s ears. She started--raised her\r\nhead--sprang to her feet--turned--and saw her father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Papa!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nImmediately her sire was seized with an access of stuttering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98W-w-what the d-devil\xe2\x80\x99s the--the m-m-meaning of this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer utterance was clear enough,--I fancy her parent found it almost\r\npainfully clear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rather it is for me to ask, what is the meaning of this! Is it\r\npossible, that, all the time, you have actually been concealed behind\r\nthat--screen?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUnless I am mistaken the old gentleman cowered before the directness of\r\nhis daughter\xe2\x80\x99s gaze,--and endeavoured to conceal the fact by an\r\nexplosion of passion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do-don\xe2\x80\x99t you s-speak to me li-like that, you un-undutiful girl! I--I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nyour father!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You certainly are my father; though I was unaware until now that my\r\nfather was capable of playing the part of eavesdropper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRage rendered him speechless,--or, at any rate, he chose to let us\r\nbelieve that that was the determining cause of his continuing silent.\r\nSo Marjorie turned to me,--and, on the whole, I had rather she had not.\r\nHer manner was very different from what it had been just now,--it was\r\nmore than civil, it was freezing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Am I to understand, Mr Atherton, that this has been done with your\r\ncognisance? That while you suffered me to pour out my heart to you\r\nunchecked, you were aware, all the time, that there was a listener\r\nbehind the screen?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI became keenly aware, on a sudden, that I had borne my share in\r\nplaying her a very shabby trick,--I should have liked to throw old\r\nLindon through the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The thing was not of my contriving. Had I had the opportunity I would\r\nhave compelled Mr Lindon to face you when you came in. But your\r\ndistress caused me to lose my balance. And you will do me the justice\r\nto remember that I endeavoured to induce you to come with me into\r\nanother room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I do not seem to remember your hinting at there being any\r\nparticular reason why I should have gone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You never gave me a chance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sydney!--I had not thought you would have played me such a trick!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen she said that--in such a tone!--the woman whom I loved!--I could\r\nhave hammered my head against the wall. The hound I was to have treated\r\nher so scurvily!\r\n\r\nPerceiving I was crushed she turned again to face her father, cool,\r\ncalm, stately;--she was, on a sudden, once more, the Marjorie with whom\r\nI was familiar. The demeanour of parent and child was in striking\r\ncontrast. If appearances went for aught, the odds were heavy that in\r\nany encounter which might be coming the senior would suffer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope, papa, that you are going to tell me that there has been some\r\ncurious mistake, and that nothing was farther from your intention than\r\nto listen at a keyhole. What would you have thought--and said--if I had\r\nattempted to play the spy on you? And I have always understood that men\r\nwere so particular on points of honour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOld Lindon was still hardly fit to do much else than\r\nsplutter,--certainly not qualified to chop phrases with this\r\nsharp-tongued maiden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98D-don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me li-like that, girl!--I--I believe you\xe2\x80\x99re s-stark\r\nmad!\xe2\x80\x99 He turned to me. \xe2\x80\x98W-what was that tomfoolery she was talking to\r\nyou about?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To what do you allude?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98About a rub-rubbishing b-beetle, and g-goodness alone knows\r\nwhat,--d-diseased and m-morbid imagination,--r-reared on the literature\r\nof the gutter!--I never thought that a child of mine could have s-sunk\r\nto such a depth!--Now, Atherton, I ask you to t-tell me frankly,--what\r\ndo you think of a child who behaves as she has done? who t-takes a\r\nnameless vagabond into the house and con-conceals his presence from her\r\nfather? And m-mark the sequel! even the vagabond warns her against the\r\nr-rascal Lessingham!--Now, Atherton, tell me what you think of a girl\r\nwho behaves like that?\xe2\x80\x99 I shrugged my shoulders. \xe2\x80\x98I--I know very well\r\nwhat you d-do think of her,--don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid to say it out because\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s present.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; Sydney, don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI saw that her eyes were dancing,--in a manner of speaking, her looks\r\nbrightened under the sunshine of her father\xe2\x80\x99s displeasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let\xe2\x80\x99s hear what you think of her as a--as a m-man of the world!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray, Sydney, do!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What you feel for her in your--your heart of hearts!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Sydney, what do you feel for me in your heart of hearts?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe baggage beamed with heartless sweetness,--she was making a mock of\r\nme. Her father turned as if he would have rent her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98D-don\xe2\x80\x99t you speak until you\xe2\x80\x99re spoken to! Atherton, I--I hope I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\ndeceived in you; I--I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re the man I--I took you for; that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re willing and--and ready to play the part of a-a-an honest friend\r\nto this mis-misguided simpleton. T-this is not the time for mincing\r\nwords, it--it\xe2\x80\x99s the time for candid speech. Tell this--this weak-minded\r\nyoung woman, right out, whether this man Lessingham is, or is not, a\r\ndamned scoundrel.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Papa!--Do you really think that Sydney\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, or your opinion, is\r\nlikely to alter facts?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you hear, Atherton, tell this wretched girl the truth!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Mr Lindon, I have already told you that I know nothing either\r\nfor or against Mr Lessingham except what is known to all the world.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Exactly,--and all the world knows him to be a miserable adventurer who\r\nis scheming to entrap my daughter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am bound to say, since you press me, that your language appears to\r\nme to be unnecessarily strong.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Atherton, I--I\xe2\x80\x99m ashamed of you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You see, Sydney, even papa is ashamed of you; now you are outside the\r\npale.--My dear papa, if you will allow me to speak, I will tell you\r\nwhat I know to be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\r\ntruth.--That Mr Lessingham is a man with great gifts goes without\r\nsaying,--permit me, papa! He is a man of genius. He is a man of honour.\r\nHe is a man of the loftiest ambitions, of the highest aims. He has\r\ndedicated his whole life to the improvement of the conditions amidst\r\nwhich the less fortunate of his fellow countrymen are at present\r\ncompelled to exist. That seems to me to be an object well worth having.\r\nHe has asked me to share his life-work, and I have told him that I\r\nwill; when, and where, and how, he wants me to. And I will. I do not\r\nsuppose his life has been free from peccadilloes. I have no delusion on\r\nthe point. What man\xe2\x80\x99s life has? Who among men can claim to be without\r\nsin? Even the members of our highest families sometimes hide behind\r\nscreens. But I know that he is, at least, as good a man as I ever met,\r\nI am persuaded that I shall never meet a better; and I thank God that I\r\nhave found favour in his eyes.--Good-bye, Sydney.--I suppose I shall\r\nsee you again, papa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith the merest inclination of her head to both of us she straightway\r\nleft the room. Lindon would have stopped her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98S-stay, y-y-y-you--\xe2\x80\x99 he stuttered.\r\n\r\nBut I caught him by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you will be advised by me, you will let her go. No good purpose\r\nwill be served by a multiplication of words.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Atherton, I--I\xe2\x80\x99m disappointed in you. You--you haven\xe2\x80\x99t behaved as I\r\nexpected. I--I haven\xe2\x80\x99t received from you the assistance which I looked\r\nfor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Lindon, it seems to me that your method of diverting the young\r\nlady from the path which she has set herself to tread is calculated to\r\nsend her furiously along it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98C-confound the women! c-confound the women! I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind telling you,\r\nin c-confidence, that at--at times, her mother was the devil, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe--I\xe2\x80\x99ll be hanged if her daughter isn\xe2\x80\x99t worse.--What was the\r\ntomfoolery she was talking to you about? Is she mad?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,--I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she\xe2\x80\x99s mad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never heard such stuff, it made my blood run cold to hear her.\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with the girl?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,--you must excuse my saying that I don\xe2\x80\x99t fancy you quite\r\nunderstand women.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I--I don\xe2\x80\x99t,--and I--I--I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to either.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI hesitated; then resolved on a taradiddle,--in Marjorie\xe2\x80\x99s interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Marjorie is high-strung,--extremely sensitive. Her imagination is\r\nquickly aflame. Perhaps, last night, you drove her as far as was safe.\r\nYou heard for yourself how, in consequence, she suffered. You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant people to say you have driven her into a lunatic asylum.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I--good heavens, no! I--I\xe2\x80\x99ll send for the doctor directly I get\r\nhome,--I--I\xe2\x80\x99ll have the best opinion in town.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll do nothing of the kind,--you\xe2\x80\x99ll only make her worse. What you\r\nhave to do is to be patient with her, and let her have peace.--As for\r\nthis affair of Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s, I have a suspicion that it may not be all\r\nsuch plain sailing as she supposes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean nothing. I only wish you to understand that until you hear from\r\nme again you had better let matters slide. Give the girl her head.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give the girl her head! H-haven\xe2\x80\x99t I--I g-given the g-girl her h-head\r\nall her l-life!\xe2\x80\x99 He looked at his watch. \xe2\x80\x98Why, the day\xe2\x80\x99s half gone!\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\nbegan scurrying towards the front door, I following at his heels. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot a committee meeting on at the club,--m-most important! For weeks\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve been giving us the worst food you ever tasted in your\r\nlife,--p-played havoc with my digestion, and I--I\xe2\x80\x99m going to tell them\r\nif--things aren\xe2\x80\x99t changed, they--they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to pay my doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbills.--As for that man, Lessingham--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he himself opened the hall door, and there, standing on\r\nthe step was \xe2\x80\x98that man Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99 himself. Lindon was a picture. The\r\nApostle was as cool as a cucumber. He held out his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good morning, Mr Lindon. What delightful weather we are having.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLindon put his hand behind his back,--and behaved as stupidly as he\r\nvery well could have done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will understand, Mr Lessingham, that, in future, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know you,\r\nand that I shall decline to recognise you anywhere; and that what I say\r\napplies equally to any member of my family.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith his hat very much on the back of his head he went down the steps\r\nlike an inflated turkeycock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXII.\r\n THE HAUNTED MAN\r\n\r\nTo have received the cut discourteous from his future father-in-law\r\nmight have been the most commonplace of incidents,--Lessingham evinced\r\nnot a trace of discomposure. So far as I could judge, he took no notice\r\nof the episode whatever, behaving exactly as if nothing had happened.\r\nHe merely waited till Mr Lindon was well off the steps; then, turning\r\nto me, he placidly observed,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Interrupting you again, you see.--May I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe sight of him had set up such a turmoil in my veins, that, for the\r\nmoment, I could not trust myself to speak. I felt, acutely, that an\r\nexplanation with him was, of all things, the thing most to be\r\ndesired,--and that quickly. Providence could not have thrown him more\r\nopportunely in the way. If, before he went away, we did not understand\r\neach other a good deal more clearly, upon certain points, the fault\r\nshould not be mine. Without a responsive word, turning on my heels, I\r\nled the way into the laboratory.\r\n\r\nWhether he noticed anything peculiar in my demeanour, I could not tell.\r\nWithin he looked about him with that purely facial smile, the sight of\r\nwhich had always engendered in me a certain distrust of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you always receive visitors in here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By no means.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStooping down, he picked up something from the floor. It was a lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npurse,--a gorgeous affair, of crimson leather and gleaming gold.\r\nWhether it was Marjorie\xe2\x80\x99s or Miss Grayling\xe2\x80\x99s I could not tell. He\r\nwatched me as I examined it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it yours?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. It is not mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPlacing his hat and umbrella on one chair, he placed himself upon\r\nanother,--very leisurely. Crossing his legs, laying his folded hands\r\nupon his knees, he sat and looked at me. I was quite conscious of his\r\nobservation; but endured it in silence, being a little wishful that he\r\nshould begin.\r\n\r\nPresently he had, as I suppose, enough of looking at me, and spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Atherton, what is the matter with you?--Have I done something to\r\noffend you too?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why do you ask?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your manner seems a little singular.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You think so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What have you come to see me about?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just now, nothing.--I like to know where I stand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis manner was courteous, easy, even graceful. I was outmanoeuvred. I\r\nunderstood the man sufficiently well to be aware that when once he was\r\non the defensive, the first blow would have to come from me. So I\r\nstruck it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I, also, like to know where I stand.--Lessingham, I am aware, and you\r\nknow that I am aware, that you have made certain overtures to Miss\r\nLindon. That is a fact in which I am keenly interested.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As--how?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Lindons and the Athertons are not the acquaintances of one\r\ngeneration only. Marjorie Lindon and I have been friends since\r\nchildhood. She looks upon me as a brother--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As a brother?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As a brother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Lindon regards me as a son. He has given me his confidence; as I\r\nbelieve you are aware, Marjorie has given me hers; and now I want you\r\nto give me yours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you want to know?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish to explain my position before I say what I have to say, because\r\nI want you to understand me clearly.--I believe, honestly, that the\r\nthing I most desire in this world is to see Marjorie Lindon happy. If I\r\nthought she would be happy with you, I should say, God speed you both!\r\nand I should congratulate you with all my heart, because I think that\r\nyou would have won the best girl in the whole world to be your wife.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think so too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, before I did that, I should have to see, at least, some\r\nreasonable probability that she would be happy with you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why should she not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you answer a question?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is the question?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is the story in your life of which you stand in such hideous\r\nterror?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a perceptible pause before he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Explain yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No explanation is needed,--you know perfectly well what I mean.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You credit me with miraculous acumen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t juggle, Lessingham,--be frank!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The frankness should not be all on one side.--There is that in your\r\nfrankness, although you may be unconscious of it, which some men might\r\nnot unreasonably resent.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you resent it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That depends. If you are arrogating to yourself the right to place\r\nyourself between Miss Lindon and me, I do resent it, strongly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Answer my question!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I answer no question which is addressed to me in such a tone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was as calm as you please. I recognised that already I was in peril\r\nof losing my temper,--which was not at all what I desired. I eyed him\r\nintently, he returning me look for look. His countenance betrayed no\r\nsign of a guilty conscience; I had not seen him more completely at his\r\nease. He smiled,--facially, and also, as it seemed to me, a little\r\nderisively. I am bound to admit that his bearing showed not the\r\nfaintest shadow of resentment, and that in his eyes there was a\r\ngentleness, a softness, which I had not observed in them before,--I\r\ncould almost have suspected him of being sympathetic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In this matter, you must know, I stand in the place of Mr Lindon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Surely you must understand that before anyone is allowed to think of\r\nmarriage with Marjorie Lindon he will have to show that his past, as\r\nthe advertisements have it, will bear the fullest investigation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that so?--Will your past bear the fullest investigation?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI winced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At any rate, it is known to all the world.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it?--Forgive me if I say, I doubt it. I doubt if, of any wise man,\r\nthat can be said with truth. In all our lives there are episodes which\r\nwe keep to ourselves.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI felt that that was so true that, for the instant, I hardly knew what\r\nto say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But there are episodes and episodes, and when it comes to a man being\r\nhaunted one draws the line.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Haunted?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As you are.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe got up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Atherton, I think that I understand you, but I fear that you do not\r\nunderstand me.\xe2\x80\x99 He went to where a self-acting mercurial air-pump was\r\nstanding on a shelf. \xe2\x80\x98What is this curious arrangement of glass tubes\r\nand bulbs?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not think that you do understand me, or you would know that I am\r\nin no mood to be trifled with.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it some kind of an exhauster?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Lessingham, I am entirely at your service. I intend to have an\r\nanswer to my question before you leave this room, but, in the\r\nmeanwhile, your convenience is mine. There are some very interesting\r\nthings here which you might care to see.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Marvellous, is it not, how the human intellect progresses,--from\r\nconquest unto conquest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Among the ancients the progression had proceeded farther than with us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In what respect?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For instance, in the affair of the Apotheosis of the Beetle;--I saw it\r\ntake place last night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here,--within a few feet of where you are standing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you serious?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perfectly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did you see?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I saw the legendary Apotheosis of the Beetle performed, last night,\r\nbefore my eyes, with a gaudy magnificence at which the legends never\r\nhinted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is odd. I once thought that I saw something of the kind myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I understand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98From whom?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98From a friend of yours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98From a friend of mine?--Are you sure it was from a friend of mine?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe man\xe2\x80\x99s attempt at coolness did him credit,--but it did not deceive\r\nme. That he thought I was endeavouring to bluff him out of his secret I\r\nperceived quite clearly; that it was a secret which he would only\r\nrender with his life I was beginning to suspect. Had it not been for\r\nMarjorie, I should have cared nothing,--his affairs were his affairs;\r\nthough I realised perfectly well that there was something about the man\r\nwhich, from the scientific explorer\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, might be well\r\nworth finding out. Still, as I say, if it had not been for Marjorie, I\r\nshould have let it go; but, since she was so intimately concerned in\r\nit, I wondered more and more what it could be.\r\n\r\nMy attitude towards what is called the supernatural is an open one.\r\nThat all things are possible I unhesitatingly believe,--I have, even in\r\nmy short time, seen so many so-called impossibilities proved possible.\r\nThat we know everything, I doubt;--that our\r\ngreat-great-great-great-grandsires, our forebears of thousands of years\r\nago, of the extinct civilisations, knew more on some subjects than we\r\ndo, I think is, at least, probable. All the legends can hardly be false.\r\n\r\nBecause men claimed to be able to do things in those days which we\r\ncannot do, and which we do not know how they did, we profess to think\r\nthat their claims are finally dismissed by exclaiming--lies! But it is\r\nnot so sure.\r\n\r\nFor my part, what I had seen I had seen. I had seen some devil\xe2\x80\x99s trick\r\nplayed before my very eyes. Some trick of the same sort seemed to have\r\nbeen played upon my Marjorie,--I repeat that I write \xe2\x80\x98my Marjorie\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbecause, to me, she will always be \xe2\x80\x98my\xe2\x80\x99 Marjorie! It had driven her\r\nhalf out of her senses. As I looked at Lessingham, I seemed to see her\r\nat his side, as I had seen her not long ago, with her white, drawn\r\nface, and staring eyes, dumb with an agony of fear. Her life was\r\nbidding fair to be knit with his,--what Upas tree of horror was rooted\r\nin his very bones? The thought that her sweet purity was likely to be\r\nengulfed in a devil\xe2\x80\x99s slough in which he was wallowing was not to be\r\nendured. As I realised that the man was more than my match at the game\r\nwhich I was playing--in which such vital interests were at stake!--my\r\nhands itched to clutch him by the throat, and try another way.\r\n\r\nDoubtless my face revealed my feelings, because, presently, he said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you aware how strangely you are looking at me, Atherton? Were my\r\ncountenance a mirror I think you would be surprised to see in it your\r\nown.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI drew back from him,--I daresay, sullenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not so surprised as, yesterday morning, you would have been to have\r\nseen yours,--at the mere sight of a pictured scarab.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How easily you quarrel.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not quarrel.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s I. If that is so, then, at once, the quarrel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nended,--pouf! it\xe2\x80\x99s done. Mr Lindon, I fear, because, politically, we\r\ndiffer, regards me as anathema. Has he put some of his spirit into\r\nyou?--You are a wiser man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am aware that you are an adept with words. But this is a case in\r\nwhich words only will not serve.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then what will serve?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am myself beginning to wonder.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As you so courteously suggest, I believe I am wiser than Lindon. I do\r\nnot care for your politics, or for what you call your politics, one\r\nfig. I do not care if you are as other men are, as I am,--not unspotted\r\nfrom the world! But I do care if you are leprous. And I believe you\r\nare.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Atherton!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ever since I have known you I have been conscious of there being\r\nsomething about you which I found it difficult to diagnose;--in an\r\nunwholesome sense, something out of the common, non-natural; an\r\natmosphere of your own. Events, so far as you are concerned, have,\r\nduring the last few days moved quickly. They have thrown an\r\nuncomfortably lurid light on that peculiarity of yours which I have\r\nnoticed. Unless you can explain them to my satisfaction, you will\r\nwithdraw your pretensions to Miss Lindon\xe2\x80\x99s hand, or I shall place\r\ncertain facts before that lady, and, if necessary, publish them to the\r\nworld.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe grew visibly paler but he smiled--facially.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have your own way of conducting a conversation, Mr Atherton.--What\r\nare the events to whose rapid transit you are alluding?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who was the individual, practically stark naked, who came out of your\r\nhouse, in such singular fashion, at dead of night?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that one of the facts with which you propose to tickle the public\r\near?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that the only explanation which you have to offer?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Proceed, for the present, with your indictment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not so unobservant as you appear to imagine. There were features\r\nabout the episode which struck me forcibly at the time, and which have\r\nstruck me more forcibly since. To suggest, as you did yesterday\r\nmorning, that it was an ordinary case of burglary, or that the man was\r\na lunatic, is an absurdity.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me,--I did nothing of the kind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then what do you suggest?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suggested, and do suggest, nothing. All the suggestions come from\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You went very much out of your way to beg me to keep the matter quiet.\r\nThere is an appearance of suggestion about that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You take a jaundiced view of all my actions, Mr Atherton. Nothing, to\r\nme, could seem more natural.--However,--proceed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had his hands behind his back, and rested them on the edge of the\r\ntable against which he was leaning. He was undoubtedly ill at ease; but\r\nso far I had not made the impression on him, either mentally or\r\nmorally, which I desired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is your Oriental friend?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not follow you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you sure?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am certain. Repeat your question.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is your Oriental friend?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was not aware that I had one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you swear that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe laughed, a strange laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you seek to catch me tripping? You conduct your case with too much\r\nanimus. You must allow me to grasp the exact purport of your inquiry\r\nbefore I can undertake to reply to it on oath.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you not aware that at present there is in London an individual who\r\nclaims to have had a very close, and a very curious, acquaintance with\r\nyou in the East?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That you swear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That I do swear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is singular.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why is it singular?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because I fancy that that individual haunts you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Haunts me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Haunts you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You jest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You think so?--You remember that picture of the scarabaeus which,\r\nyesterday morning, frightened you into a state of semi-idiocy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You use strong language.--I know what you allude to.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you mean to say that you don\xe2\x80\x99t know that you were indebted for that\r\nto your Oriental friend?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you sure?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly I am sure.--It occurs to me, Mr Atherton, that an\r\nexplanation is demanded from you rather than from me. Are you aware\r\nthat the purport of my presence here is to ask you how that picture\r\nfound its way into your room?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was projected by the Lord of the Beetle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe words were chance ones,--but they struck a mark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Lord--\xe2\x80\x99 He faltered,--and stopped. He showed signs of\r\ndiscomposure. \xe2\x80\x98I will be frank with you,--since frankness is what you\r\nask.\xe2\x80\x99 His smile, that time, was obviously forced. \xe2\x80\x98Recently I have been\r\nthe victim of delusions;\xe2\x80\x99 there was a pause before the word, \xe2\x80\x98of a\r\nsingular kind. I have feared that they were the result of mental\r\noverstrain. Is it possible that you can enlighten me as to their\r\nsource?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI was silent. He was putting a great strain upon himself, but the\r\ntwitching of his lips betrayed him. A little more, and I should reach\r\nthe other side of Mr Lessingham,--the side which he kept hidden from\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is this--individual whom you speak of as my--Oriental friend?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Being your friend, you should know better than I do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What sort of man is he to look at?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did not say it was a man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I presume it is a man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did not say so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe seemed, for a moment, to hold his breath,--and he looked at me with\r\neyes which were not friendly. Then, with a display of self-command\r\nwhich did him credit, he drew himself upright, with an air of dignity\r\nwhich well became him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Atherton, consciously, or unconsciously, you are doing me a serious\r\ninjustice. I do not know what conception it is which you have formed of\r\nme, or on what the conception is founded, but I protest that, to the\r\nbest of my knowledge and belief, I am as reputable, as honest, and as\r\nclean a man as you are.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you\xe2\x80\x99re haunted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Haunted?\xe2\x80\x99 He held himself erect, looking me straight in the face. Then\r\na shiver went all over him; the muscles of his mouth twitched; and, in\r\nan instant, he was livid. He staggered against the table. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, God\r\nknows it\xe2\x80\x99s true,--I\xe2\x80\x99m haunted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So either you\xe2\x80\x99re mad, and therefore unfit to marry; or else you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ndone something which places you outside the tolerably generous\r\nboundaries of civilised society, and are therefore still more unfit to\r\nmarry. You\xe2\x80\x99re on the horns of a dilemma.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I--I\xe2\x80\x99m the victim of a delusion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is the nature of the delusion? Does it take the shape of\r\na--beetle?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Atherton!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWithout the slightest warning, he collapsed,--was transformed; I can\r\ndescribe the change which took place in him in no other way. He sank in\r\na heap on the floor; he held up his hands above his head; and he\r\ngibbered,--like some frenzied animal. A more uncomfortable spectacle\r\nthan he presented it would be difficult to find. I have seen it matched\r\nin the padded rooms of lunatic asylums, but nowhere else. The sight of\r\nhim set every nerve of my body on edge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name, what is the matter with you, man? Are you stark,\r\nstaring mad? Here,--drink this!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFilling a tumbler with brandy, I forced it between his quivering\r\nfingers. Then it was some moments before I could get him to understand\r\nwhat it was I wanted him to do. When he did get the glass to his lips,\r\nhe swallowed its contents as if they were so much water. By degrees his\r\nsenses returned to him. He stood up. He looked about him, with a smile\r\nwhich was positively ghastly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s--it\xe2\x80\x99s a delusion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a very queer kind of a delusion, if it is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI eyed him, curiously. He was evidently making the most strenuous\r\nefforts to regain his self-control,--all the while with that horrible\r\nsmile about his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Atherton, you--you take me at an advantage.\xe2\x80\x99 I was still. \xe2\x80\x98Who--who\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyour Oriental friend?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My Oriental friend?--you mean yours. I supposed, at first, that the\r\nindividual in question was a man; but it appears that she\xe2\x80\x99s a woman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A woman?--Oh.--How do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, the face is a man\xe2\x80\x99s--of an uncommonly disagreeable type, of\r\nwhich the powers forbid that there are many!--and the voice is a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s,--also of a kind!--but the body, as, last night, I chanced to\r\ndiscover, is a woman\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That sounds very odd.\xe2\x80\x99 He closed his eyes. I could see that his cheeks\r\nwere clammy. \xe2\x80\x98Do you--do you believe in witchcraft?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That depends.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you heard of Obi?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been told that an Obeah man can put a spell upon a person which\r\ncompels a person to see whatever he--the Obeah man--may please. Do you\r\nthink that\xe2\x80\x99s possible?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not a question to which I should be disposed to answer either\r\nyes or no.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked at me out of his half-closed eyes. It struck me that he was\r\nmaking conversation,--saying anything for the sake of gaining time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I remember reading a book entitled \xe2\x80\x9cObscure Diseases of the Brain.\xe2\x80\x9d It\r\ncontained some interesting data on the subject of hallucinations.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Possibly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, candidly, would you recommend me to place myself in the hands of\r\na mental pathologist?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that you\xe2\x80\x99re insane, if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you mean.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No?--That is good hearing. Of all diseases insanity is the most to be\r\ndreaded.--Well, Atherton, I\xe2\x80\x99m keeping you. The truth is that, insane or\r\nnot, I am very far from well. I think I must give myself a holiday.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe moved towards his hat and umbrella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is something else which you must do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must resign your pretensions to Miss Lindon\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Atherton, if my health is really failing me, I shall resign\r\neverything,--everything!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe repeated his own word with a little movement of his hands which was\r\npathetic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Understand me, Lessingham. What else you do is no affair of mine. I am\r\nconcerned only with Miss Lindon. You must give me your definite\r\npromise, before you leave this room, to terminate your engagement with\r\nher before to-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis back was towards me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There will come a time when your conscience will prick you because of\r\nyour treatment of me; when you will realise that I am the most\r\nunfortunate of men.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I realise that now. It is because I realise it that I am so desirous\r\nthat the shadow of your evil fortune shall not fall upon an innocent\r\ngirl.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe turned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Atherton, what is your actual position with reference to Marjorie\r\nLindon?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She regards me as a brother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And do you regard her as a sister? Are your sentiments towards her\r\npurely fraternal?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know that I love her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And do you suppose that my removal will clear the path for you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose nothing of the kind. You may believe me or not, but my one\r\ndesire is for her happiness, and surely, if you love her, that is your\r\ndesire too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is so.\xe2\x80\x99 He paused. An expression of sadness stole over his face\r\nof which I had not thought it capable. \xe2\x80\x98That is so to an extent of\r\nwhich you do not dream. No man likes to have his hand forced,\r\nespecially by one whom he regards--may I say it?--as a possible rival.\r\nBut I will tell you this much. If the blight which has fallen on my\r\nlife is likely to continue, I would not wish,--God forbid that I should\r\nwish to join her fate with mine,--not for all that the world could\r\noffer me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe stopped. And I was still. Presently he continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When I was younger I was subject to a--similar delusion. But it\r\nvanished,--I saw no trace of it for years,--I thought that I had done\r\nwith it for good. Recently, however, it has returned,--as you have\r\nwitnessed. I shall institute inquiries into the cause of its\r\nreappearance; if it seems likely to be irremovable, or even if it bids\r\nfair to be prolonged, I shall not only, as you phrase it, withdraw my\r\npretensions to Miss Lindon\xe2\x80\x99s hand, but to all my other ambitions. In\r\nthe interim, as regards Miss Lindon I shall be careful to hold myself\r\non the footing of a mere acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You promise me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do.--And on your side, Atherton, in the meantime, deal with me more\r\ngently. Judgment in my case has still to be given. You will find that I\r\nam not the guilty wretch you apparently imagine. And there are few\r\nthings more disagreeable to one\xe2\x80\x99s self-esteem than to learn, too late,\r\nthat one has persisted in judging another man too harshly. Think of all\r\nthat the world has, at this moment, to offer me, and what it will mean\r\nif I have to turn my back on it,--owing to a mischievous twist of\r\nfortune\xe2\x80\x99s wheel.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe turned, as if to go. Then stopped, and looked round, in an attitude\r\nof listening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a sound of droning,--I recalled what Marjorie had said of her\r\nexperiences of the night before, it was like the droning of a beetle.\r\nThe instant the Apostle heard it, the fashion of his countenance began\r\nto change,--it was pitiable to witness. I rushed to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lessingham!--don\xe2\x80\x99t be a fool!--play the man!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe gripped my left arm with his right hand till it felt as if it were\r\nbeing compressed in a vice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then--I shall have to have some more brandy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFortunately the bottle was within reach from where I stood, otherwise I\r\ndoubt if he would have released my arm to let me get at it. I gave him\r\nthe decanter and the glass. He helped himself to a copious libation. By\r\nthe time that he had swallowed it the droning sound had gone. He put\r\ndown the empty tumbler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When a man has to resort to alcohol to keep his nerves up to concert\r\npitch, things are in a bad way with him, you may be sure of that,--but\r\nthen you have never known what it is to stand in momentary expectation\r\nof a t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate with the devil.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain he turned to leave the room,--and this time he actually went. I\r\nlet him go alone. I heard his footsteps passing along the passage, and\r\nthe hall-door close. Then I sat in an arm-chair, stretched my legs out\r\nin front of me, thrust my hands in my trouser pockets, and--I wondered.\r\n\r\nI had been there, perhaps, four or five minutes, when there was a\r\nslight noise at my side. Glancing round, I saw a sheet of paper come\r\nfluttering through the open window. It fell almost at my feet. I picked\r\nit up. It was a picture of a beetle,--a facsimile of the one which had\r\nhad such an extraordinary effect on Mr Lessingham the day before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If this was intended for St Paul, it\xe2\x80\x99s a trifle late;--unless--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI could hear that someone was approaching along the corridor. I looked\r\nup, expecting to see the Apostle reappear;--in which expectation I was\r\nagreeably disappointed. The newcomer was feminine. It was Miss\r\nGrayling. As she stood in the open doorway, I saw that her cheeks were\r\nred as roses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope I am not interrupting you again, but--I left my purse here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nShe stopped; then added, as if it were an afterthought, \xe2\x80\x98And--I want\r\nyou to come and lunch with me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI locked the picture of the beetle in the drawer,--and I lunched with\r\nDora Grayling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n BOOK III.\r\n The Terror by Night and the Terror by Day\r\n\r\n _Miss Marjorie Lindon tells the Tale_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n THE WAY HE TOLD HER\r\n\r\nI am the happiest woman in the world! I wonder how many women have said\r\nthat of themselves in their time,--but I am. Paul has told me that he\r\nloves me. How long I have made inward confession of my love for him, I\r\nshould be ashamed to say. It sounds prosaic, but I believe it is a fact\r\nthat the first stirring of my pulses was caused by the report of a\r\nspeech of his which I read in the _Times_. It was on the Eight Hours\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBill. Papa was most unflattering. He said that he was an oily spouter,\r\nan ignorant agitator, an irresponsible firebrand, and a good deal more\r\nto the same effect. I remember very well how papa fidgeted with the\r\npaper, declaring that it read even worse than it had sounded, and\r\ngoodness knew that it had sounded bad enough. He was so very emphatic\r\nthat when he had gone I thought I would see what all the pother was\r\nabout, and read the speech for myself. So I read it. It affected me\r\nquite differently. The speaker\xe2\x80\x99s words showed such knowledge, charity,\r\nand sympathy that they went straight to my heart.\r\n\r\nAfter that I read everything of Paul Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s which I came across.\r\nAnd the more I read the more I was impressed. But it was some time\r\nbefore we met. Considering what papa\xe2\x80\x99s opinions were, it was not likely\r\nthat he would go out of his way to facilitate a meeting. To him, the\r\nmere mention of the name was like a red rag to a bull. But at last we\r\ndid meet. And then I knew that he was stronger, greater, better even\r\nthan his words. It is so often the other way; one finds that men, and\r\nwomen too, are so apt to put their best, as it were, into their shop\r\nwindows, that the discovery was as novel as it was delightful.\r\n\r\nWhen the ice was once broken, we often met. I do not know how it was.\r\nWe did not plan our meetings,--at first, at any rate. Yet we seemed\r\nalways meeting. Seldom a day passed on which we did not\r\nmeet,--sometimes twice or thrice. It was odd how we were always coming\r\nacross each other in the most unlikely places. I believe we did not\r\nnotice it at the time, but looking back I can see that we must have\r\nmanaged our engagements so that somewhere, somehow, we should be\r\ncertain to have an opportunity of exchanging half a dozen words. Those\r\nconstant encounters could not have all been chance ones.\r\n\r\nBut I never supposed he loved me,--never. I am not even sure that, for\r\nsome time, I was aware that I loved him. We were great on friendship,\r\nboth of us.--I was quite aware that I was his friend,--that he regarded\r\nme as his friend; he told me so more than once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I tell you this,\xe2\x80\x99 he would say, referring to this, that, or the other,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98because I know that, in speaking to you, I am speaking to a friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith him those were not empty words. All kinds of people talk to one\r\nlike that,--especially men; it is a kind of formula which they use with\r\nevery woman who shows herself disposed to listen. But Paul is not like\r\nthat. He is chary of speech; not by any means a woman\xe2\x80\x99s man. I tell him\r\nthat is his weakest point. If legend does not lie more even than is\r\ncommon, few politicians have achieved prosperity without the aid of\r\nwomen. He replies that he is not a politician; that he never means to\r\nbe a politician. He simply wishes to work for his country; if his\r\ncountry does not need his services--well, let it be. Papa\xe2\x80\x99s political\r\nfriends have always so many axes of their own to grind, that, at first,\r\nto hear a member of Parliament talk like that was almost disquieting. I\r\nhad dreamed of men like that; but I never encountered one till I met\r\nPaul Lessingham.\r\n\r\nOur friendship was a pleasant one. It became pleasanter and pleasanter.\r\nUntil there came a time when he told me everything; the dreams he\r\ndreamed; the plans which he had planned; the great purposes which, if\r\nhealth and strength were given him, he intended to carry to a great\r\nfulfilment. And, at last, he told me something else.\r\n\r\nIt was after a meeting at a Working Women\xe2\x80\x99s Club in Westminster. He had\r\nspoken, and I had spoken too. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what papa would have said,\r\nif he had known, but I had. A formal resolution had been proposed, and\r\nI had seconded it,--in perhaps a couple of hundred words; but that\r\nwould have been quite enough for papa to have regarded me as an\r\nAbandoned Wretch,--papa always puts those sort of words into capitals.\r\nPapa regards a speechifying woman as a thing of horror,--I have known\r\nhim look askance at a Primrose Dame.\r\n\r\nThe night was fine. Paul proposed that I should walk with him down the\r\nWestminster Bridge Road, until we reached the House, and then he would\r\nsee me into a cab. I did as he suggested. It was still early, not yet\r\nten, and the streets were alive with people. Our conversation, as we\r\nwent, was entirely political. The Agricultural Amendment Act was then\r\nbefore the Commons, and Paul felt very strongly that it was one of\r\nthose measures which give with one hand, while taking with the other.\r\nThe committee stage was at hand, and already several amendments were\r\nthreatened, the effect of which would be to strengthen the landlord at\r\nthe expense of the tenant. More than one of these, and they not the\r\nmost moderate, were to be proposed by papa. Paul was pointing out how\r\nit would be his duty to oppose these tooth and nail, when, all at once,\r\nhe stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I sometimes wonder how you really feel upon this matter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On the difference of opinion, in political matters, which exists\r\nbetween your father and myself. I am conscious that Mr Lindon regards\r\nmy action as a personal question, and resents it so keenly, that I am\r\nsometimes moved to wonder if at least a portion of his resentment is\r\nnot shared by you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have explained; I consider papa the politician as one person, and\r\npapa the father as quite another.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are his daughter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly I am;--but would you, on that account, wish me to share his\r\npolitical opinions, even though I believe them to be wrong?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You love him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course I do,--he is the best of fathers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your defection will be a grievous disappointment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI looked at him out of the corner of my eye. I wondered what was\r\npassing through his mind. The subject of my relations with papa was one\r\nwhich, without saying anything at all about it, we had consented to\r\ntaboo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not so sure. I am permeated with a suspicion that papa has no\r\npolitics.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Lindon!--I fancy that I can adduce proof to the contrary.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe that if papa were to marry again, say, a Home Ruler, within\r\nthree weeks his wife\xe2\x80\x99s politics would be his own.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPaul thought before he spoke; then he smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose that men sometimes do change their coats to please their\r\nwives,--even their political ones.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Papa\xe2\x80\x99s opinions are the opinions of those with whom he mixes. The\r\nreason why he consorts with Tories of the crusted school is because he\r\nfears that if he associated with anybody else--with Radicals,\r\nsay,--before he knew it, he would be a Radical too. With him,\r\nassociation is synonymous with logic.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPaul laughed outright. By this time we had reached Westminster Bridge.\r\nStanding, we looked down upon the river. A long line of lanterns was\r\ngliding mysteriously over the waters; it was a tug towing a string of\r\nbarges. For some moments neither spoke. Then Paul recurred to what I\r\nhad just been saying.\r\n\r\n [IMAGE: images/img_187.jpg\r\n CAPTION: PRESENTLY HIS HAND FASTENED UPON MINE AND HELD IT TIGHT.]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you,--do you think marriage would colour your convictions?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would it yours?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That depends.\xe2\x80\x99 He was silent. Then he said, in that tone which I had\r\nlearned to look for when he was most in earnest, \xe2\x80\x98It depends on whether\r\nyou would marry me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI was still. His words were so unexpected that they took my breath\r\naway. I knew not what to make of them. My head was in a whirl. Then he\r\naddressed to me a monosyllabic interrogation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI found my voice,--or a part of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?--to what?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe came a little closer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you be my wife?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe part of my voice which I had found, was lost again. Tears came into\r\nmy eyes. I shivered. I had not thought that I could be so absurd. Just\r\nthen the moon came from behind a cloud; the rippling waters were tipped\r\nwith silver. He spoke again, so gently that his words just reached my\r\nears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know that I love you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen I knew that I loved him too. That what I had fancied was a feeling\r\nof friendship was something very different. It was as if somebody, in\r\ntearing a veil from before my eyes, had revealed a spectacle which\r\ndazzled me. I was speechless. He misconstrued my silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have I offended you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI fancy that he noted the tremor which was in my voice, and read it\r\nrightly. For he too was still. Presently his hand stole along the\r\nparapet, and fastened upon mine, and held it tight.\r\n\r\nAnd that was how it came about. Other things were said; but they were\r\nhardly of the first importance. Though I believe we took some time in\r\nsaying them. Of myself I can say with truth, that my heart was too full\r\nfor copious speech; I was dumb with a great happiness. And, I believe,\r\nI can say the same of Paul. He told me as much when we were parting.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that we had only just come there when Paul started. Turning,\r\nhe stared up at Big Ben.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Midnight!--The House up!--Impossible!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut it was more than possible, it was fact. We had actually been on the\r\nBridge two hours, and it had not seemed ten minutes. Never had I\r\nsupposed that the flight of time could have been so entirely unnoticed.\r\nPaul was considerably taken aback. His legislative conscience pricked\r\nhim. He excused himself--in his own fashion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fortunately, for once in a way, my business in the House was not so\r\nimportant as my business out of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had his arm through mine. We were standing face to face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So you call this business!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe laughed.\r\n\r\nHe not only saw me into a cab, but he saw me home in it. And in the cab\r\nhe kissed me. I fancy I was a little out of sorts that night. My\r\nnervous system was, perhaps, demoralised. Because, when he kissed me, I\r\ndid a thing which I never do,--I have my own standard of behaviour, and\r\nthat sort of thing is quite outside of it; I behaved like a sentimental\r\nchit. I cried. And it took him all the way to my father\xe2\x80\x99s door to\r\ncomfort me.\r\n\r\nI can only hope that, perceiving the singularity of the occasion, he\r\nconsented to excuse me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n A WOMAN\xe2\x80\x99S VIEW\r\n\r\nSydney Atherton has asked me to be his wife. It is not only annoying;\r\nworse, it is absurd.\r\n\r\nThis is the result of Paul\xe2\x80\x99s wish that our engagement should not be\r\nannounced. He is afraid of papa;--not really, but for the moment. The\r\natmosphere of the House is charged with electricity. Party feeling runs\r\nhigh. They are at each other, hammer and tongs, about this Agricultural\r\nAmendment Act. The strain on Paul is tremendous. I am beginning to feel\r\npositively concerned. Little things which I have noticed about him\r\nlately convince me that he is being overwrought. I suspect him of\r\nhaving sleepless nights. The amount of work which he has been getting\r\nthrough lately has been too much for any single human being, I care not\r\nwho he is. He himself admits that he shall be glad when the session is\r\nat an end. So shall I.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, it is his desire that nothing shall be said about our\r\nengagement until the House rises. It is reasonable enough. Papa is sure\r\nto be violent,--lately, the barest allusion to Paul\xe2\x80\x99s name has been\r\nenough to make him explode. When the discovery does come, he will be\r\nunmanageable,--I foresee it clearly. From little incidents which have\r\nhappened recently I predict the worst. He will be capable of making a\r\nscene within the precincts of the House. And, as Paul says, there is\r\nsome truth in the saying that the last straw breaks the camel\xe2\x80\x99s back.\r\nHe will be better able to face papa\xe2\x80\x99s wild wrath when the House has\r\nrisen.\r\n\r\nSo the news is to bide a wee. Of course Paul is right. And what he\r\nwishes I wish too. Still, it is not all such plain sailing for me as he\r\nperhaps thinks. The domestic atmosphere is almost as electrical as that\r\nin the House. Papa is like the terrier who scents a rat,--he is always\r\nsniffing the air. He has not actually forbidden me to speak to\r\nPaul,--his courage is not quite at the sticking point; but he is\r\nconstantly making uncomfortable allusions to persons who number among\r\ntheir acquaintance \xe2\x80\x98political adventurers,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98grasping carpet-baggers,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Radical riff-raff,\xe2\x80\x99 and that kind of thing. Sometimes I venture to\r\ncall my soul my own; but such a tempest invariably follows that I\r\nbecome discreet again as soon as I possibly can. So, as a rule, I\r\nsuffer in silence.\r\n\r\nStill, I would with all my heart that the concealment were at an end.\r\nNo one need imagine that I am ashamed of being about to marry\r\nPaul,--papa least of all. On the contrary, I am as proud of it as a\r\nwoman can be. Sometimes, when he has said or done something unusually\r\nwonderful, I fear that my pride will out,--I do feel it so strong\r\nwithin me. I should be delighted to have a trial of strength with papa;\r\nanywhere, at any time,--I should not be so rude to him as he would be\r\nto me. At the bottom of his heart papa knows that I am the more\r\nsensible of the two; after a pitched battle or so he would understand\r\nit better still. I know papa! I have not been his daughter for all\r\nthese years in vain. I feel like hot-blooded soldiers must feel, who,\r\nburning to attack the enemy in the open field, are ordered to skulk\r\nbehind hedges, and be shot at.\r\n\r\nOne result is that Sydney has actually made a proposal of marriage,--he\r\nof all people! It is too comical. The best of it was that he took\r\nhimself quite seriously. I do not know how many times he has confided\r\nto me the sufferings which he has endured for love of other women--some\r\nof them, I am sorry to say, decent married women too; but this is the\r\nfirst occasion on which the theme has been a personal one. He was so\r\nfrantic, as he is wont to be, that, to calm him, I told him about\r\nPaul,--which, under the circumstances, to him I felt myself at liberty\r\nto do. In return, he was melodramatic; hinting darkly at I know not\r\nwhat. I was almost cross with him.\r\n\r\nHe is a curious person, Sydney Atherton. I suppose it is because I have\r\nknown him all my life, and have always looked upon him, in cases of\r\nnecessity, as a capital substitute for a brother, that I criticise him\r\nwith so much frankness. In some respects, he is a genius; in others--I\r\nwill not write fool, for that he never is, though he has often done\r\nsome extremely foolish things. The fame of his inventions is in the\r\nmouths of all men; though the half of them has never been told. He is\r\nthe most extraordinary mixture. The things which most people would like\r\nto have proclaimed in the street, he keeps tightly locked in his own\r\nbosom; while those which the same persons would be only too glad to\r\nconceal, he shouts from the roofs. A very famous man once told me that\r\nif Mr Atherton chose to become a specialist, to take up one branch of\r\ninquiry, and devote his life to it, his fame, before he died, would\r\nbridge the spheres. But sticking to one thing is not in Sydney\xe2\x80\x99s line\r\nat all. He prefers, like the bee, to roam from flower to flower.\r\n\r\nAs for his being in love with me; it is ridiculous. He is as much in\r\nlove with the moon. I cannot think what has put the idea into his head.\r\nSome girl must have been ill-using him, or he imagines that she has.\r\nThe girl whom he ought to marry, and whom he ultimately will marry, is\r\nDora Grayling. She is young, charming, immensely rich, and over head\r\nand ears in love with him;--if she were not, then he would be over head\r\nand ears in love with her. I believe he is very near it as it\r\nis,--sometimes he is so very rude to her. It is a characteristic of\r\nSydney\xe2\x80\x99s, that he is apt to be rude to a girl whom he really likes. As\r\nfor Dora, I suspect she dreams of him. He is tall, straight, very\r\nhandsome, with a big moustache, and the most extraordinary eyes;--I\r\nfancy that those eyes of his have as much to do with Dora\xe2\x80\x99s state as\r\nanything. I have heard it said that he possesses the hypnotic power to\r\nan unusual degree, and that, if he chose to exercise it, he might\r\nbecome a danger to society. I believe he has hypnotised Dora.\r\n\r\nHe makes an excellent brother. I have gone to him, many and many a\r\ntime, for help,--and some excellent advice I have received. I daresay I\r\nshall consult him still. There are matters of which one would hardly\r\ndare to talk to Paul. In all things he is the great man. He could\r\nhardly condescend to chiffons. Now Sydney can and does. When he is in\r\nthe mood, on the vital subject of trimmings a woman could not appeal to\r\na sounder authority. I tell him, if he had been a dressmaker, he would\r\nhave been magnificent. I am sure he would.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXV.\r\n THE MAN IN THE STREET\r\n\r\nThis morning I had an adventure.\r\n\r\nI was in the breakfast-room. Papa, as usual, was late for breakfast,\r\nand I was wondering whether I should begin without him, when, chancing\r\nto look round, something caught my eye in the street. I went to the\r\nwindow to see what it was. A small crowd of people was in the middle of\r\nthe road, and they were all staring at something which, apparently, was\r\nlying on the ground. What it was I could not see.\r\n\r\nThe butler happened to be in the room. I spoke to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Peter, what is the matter in the street? Go and see.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe went and saw; and, presently, he returned. Peter is an excellent\r\nservant; but the fashion of his speech, even when conveying the most\r\ntrivial information, is slightly sesquipedalian. He would have made a\r\ncapital cabinet minister at question time,--he wraps up the smallest\r\nportions of meaning in the largest possible words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An unfortunate individual appears to have been the victim of a\r\ncatastrophe. I am informed that he is dead. The constable asserts that\r\nhe is drunk.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Drunk?--dead? Do you mean that he is dead drunk?--at this hour!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is either one or the other. I did not behold the individual myself.\r\nI derived my information from a bystander.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat was not sufficiently explicit for me. I gave way to a, seemingly,\r\nquite causeless impulse of curiosity, I went out into the street, just\r\nas I was, to see for myself. It was, perhaps, not the most sensible\r\nthing I could have done, and papa would have been shocked; but I am\r\nalways shocking papa. It had been raining in the night, and the shoes\r\nwhich I had on were not so well suited as they might have been for an\r\nencounter with the mud.\r\n\r\nI made my way to the point of interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked.\r\n\r\nA workman, with a bag of tools over his shoulder, answered me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s something wrong with someone. Policeman says he\xe2\x80\x99s drunk, but\r\nhe looks to me as if he was something worse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you let me pass, please?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen they saw I was a woman, they permitted me to reach the centre of\r\nthe crowd.\r\n\r\nA man was lying on his back, in the grease and dirt of the road. He was\r\nso plastered with mud, that it was difficult, at first, to be sure that\r\nhe really was a man. His head and feet were bare. His body was\r\npartially covered by a long ragged cloak. It was obvious that that one\r\nwretched, dirt-stained, sopping wet rag was all the clothing he had on.\r\nA huge constable was holding his shoulders in his hands, and was\r\nregarding him as if he could not make him out at all. He seemed\r\nuncertain as to whether it was or was not a case of shamming.\r\n\r\nHe spoke to him as if he had been some refractory child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, my lad, this won\xe2\x80\x99t do!--Wake up!--What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut he neither woke up, nor explained what was the matter. I took hold\r\nof his hand. It was icy cold. Apparently the wrist was pulseless.\r\nClearly this was no ordinary case of drunkenness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is something seriously wrong, officer. Medical assistance ought\r\nto be had at once.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think he\xe2\x80\x99s in a fit, miss?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That a doctor should be able to tell you better than I can. There\r\nseems to be no pulse. I should not be surprised to find that he was--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe word \xe2\x80\x98dead\xe2\x80\x99 was actually on my lips, when the stranger saved me\r\nfrom making a glaring exposure of my ignorance by snatching his wrist\r\naway from me, and sitting up in the mud. He held out his hands in front\r\nof him, opened his eyes, and exclaimed, in a loud, but painfully\r\nraucous tone of voice, as if he was suffering from a very bad cold,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Paul Lessingham!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI was so surprised that I all but sat down in the mud. To hear Paul--my\r\nPaul!--apostrophised by an individual of his appearance, in that\r\nfashion, was something which I had not expected. Directly the words\r\nwere uttered, he closed his eyes again, sank backward, and seemingly\r\nrelapsed into unconsciousness,--the constable gripping him by the\r\nshoulder just in time to prevent him banging the back of his head\r\nagainst the road.\r\n\r\nThe officer shook him,--scarcely gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, my lad, it\xe2\x80\x99s plain that you\xe2\x80\x99re not dead!--What\xe2\x80\x99s the meaning of\r\nthis?--Move yourself!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLooking round I found that Peter was close behind. Apparently he had\r\nbeen struck by the singularity of his mistress\xe2\x80\x99 behaviour, and had\r\nfollowed to see that it did not meet with the reward which it deserved.\r\nI spoke to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Peter, let someone go at once for Dr Cotes!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDr Cotes lives just round the corner, and since it was evident that the\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s lapse into consciousness had made the policeman sceptical as to\r\nhis case being so serious as it seemed, I thought it might be advisable\r\nthat a competent opinion should be obtained without delay.\r\n\r\nPeter was starting, when again the stranger returned to\r\nconsciousness,--that is, if it really was consciousness, as to which I\r\nwas more than a little in doubt. He repeated his previous pantomime;\r\nsat up in the mud, stretched out his arms, opened his eyes unnaturally\r\nwide,--and yet they appeared unseeing!--a sort of convulsion went all\r\nover him, and he shrieked--it really amounted to shrieking--as a man\r\nmight shriek who was in mortal terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Be warned, Paul Lessingham--be warned!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor my part, that settled it. There was a mystery here which needed to\r\nbe unravelled. Twice had he called upon Paul\xe2\x80\x99s name,--and in the\r\nstrangest fashion! It was for me to learn the why and the wherefore; to\r\nascertain what connection there was between this lifeless creature and\r\nPaul Lessingham. Providence might have cast him there before my door. I\r\nmight be entertaining an angel unawares. My mind was made up on the\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Peter, hasten for Dr Cotes.\xe2\x80\x99 Peter passed the word, and immediately a\r\nfootman started running as fast as his legs would carry him. \xe2\x80\x98Officer,\r\nI will have this man taken into my father\xe2\x80\x99s house.--Will some of you\r\nmen help to carry him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere were volunteers enough, and to spare. I spoke to Peter in the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is papa down yet?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Lindon has sent down to say that you will please not wait for him\r\nfor breakfast. He has issued instructions to have his breakfast\r\nconveyed to him upstairs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x99 I nodded towards the poor wretch who was being\r\ncarried through the hall. \xe2\x80\x98You will say nothing to him about this\r\nunless he particularly asks. You understand?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPeter bowed. He is discretion itself. He knows I have my vagaries, and\r\nit is not his fault if the savour of them travels to papa.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was in the house almost as soon as the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wants washing,\xe2\x80\x99 he remarked, directly he saw him.\r\n\r\nAnd that certainly was true,--I never saw a man who stood more\r\nobviously in need of the good offices of soap and water. Then he went\r\nthrough the usual medical formula, I watching all the while. So far as\r\nI could see the man showed not the slightest sign of life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is he dead?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He will be soon, if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have something to eat. The fellow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstarving.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe doctor asked the policeman what he knew of him.\r\n\r\nThat sagacious officer\xe2\x80\x99s reply was vague. A boy had run up to him\r\ncrying that a man was lying dead in the street. He had straightway\r\nfollowed the boy, and discovered the stranger. That was all he knew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is the matter with the man?\xe2\x80\x99 I inquired of the doctor, when the\r\nconstable had gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t know.--It may be catalepsy, and it mayn\xe2\x80\x99t.--When I do know, you\r\nmay ask again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDr Cotes\xe2\x80\x99 manner was a trifle brusque,--particularly, I believe, to me.\r\nI remember that once he threatened to box my ears. When I was a small\r\nchild I used to think nothing of boxing his.\r\n\r\nRealising that no satisfaction was to be got out of a speechless\r\nman--particularly as regards his mysterious references to Paul--I went\r\nupstairs. I found that papa was under the impression that he was\r\nsuffering from a severe attack of gout. But as he was eating a capital\r\nbreakfast, and apparently enjoying it,--while I was still fasting--I\r\nventured to hope that the matter was not so serious as he feared.\r\n\r\nI mentioned nothing to him about the person whom I had found in the\r\nstreet,--lest it should aggravate his gout. When he is like that, the\r\nslightest thing does.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n A FATHER\xe2\x80\x99S NO\r\n\r\nPaul has stormed the House of Commons with one of the greatest speeches\r\nwhich even he has delivered, and I have quarrelled with papa. And,\r\nalso, I have very nearly quarrelled with Sydney.\r\n\r\nSydney\xe2\x80\x99s little affair is nothing. He actually still persists in\r\nthinking himself in love with me,--as if, since last night, when he\r\nwhat he calls \xe2\x80\x98proposed\xe2\x80\x99 to me, he has not time to fall out of love,\r\nand in again, half a dozen times; and, on the strength of it, he seems\r\nto consider himself entitled to make himself as disagreeable as he can.\r\nThat I should not mind,--for Sydney disagreeable is about as nice as\r\nSydney any other way; but when it comes to his shooting poisoned shafts\r\nat Paul, I object. If he imagines that anything he can say, or hint,\r\nwill lessen my estimation of Paul Lessingham by one hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth, he\r\nhas less wisdom even than I gave him credit for. By the way, Percy\r\nWoodville asked me to be his wife to-night,--which, also, is nothing; he\r\nhas been trying to do it for the last three years,--though, under the\r\ncircumstances, it is a little trying; but he would not spit venom\r\nmerely because I preferred another man,--and he, I believe, does care\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\nPapa\xe2\x80\x99s affair is serious. It is the first clashing of the foils,--and\r\nthis time, I imagine, the buttons are really off. This morning he said\r\na few words, not so much to, as at me. He informed me that Paul was\r\nexpected to speak to-night,--as if I did not know it!--and availed\r\nhimself of the opening to load him with the abuse which, in his case,\r\nhe thinks is not unbecoming to a gentleman. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know--or, rather, I\r\ndo know what he would think, if he heard another man use, in the\r\npresence of a woman, the kind of language which he habitually employs.\r\nHowever, I said nothing. I had a motive for allowing the chaff to fly\r\nbefore the wind.\r\n\r\nBut, to-night, issue was joined.\r\n\r\nI, of course, went to hear Paul speak,--as I have done over and over\r\nagain before. Afterwards, Paul came and fetched me from the cage. He\r\nhad to leave me for a moment, while he gave somebody a message; and in\r\nthe lobby, there was Sydney,--all sneers! I could have pinched him.\r\nJust as I was coming to the conclusion that I should have to stick a\r\npin into his arm, Paul returned,--and, positively, Sydney was rude to\r\nhim. I was ashamed, if Mr Atherton was not. As if it was not enough\r\nthat he should be insulted by a mere popinjay, at the very moment when\r\nhe had been adding another stone to the fabric of his country\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nglory,--papa came up. He actually wanted to take me away from Paul. I\r\nshould have liked to see him do it. Of course I went down with Paul to\r\nthe carriage, leaving papa to follow if he chose. He did not\r\nchoose,--but, none the less, he managed to be home within three minutes\r\nafter I had myself returned.\r\n\r\nThen the battle began.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for me to give an idea of papa in a rage. There may be\r\nmen who look well when they lose their temper, but, if there are, papa\r\nis certainly not one. He is always talking about the magnificence, and\r\nthe high breeding of the Lindons, but anything less high-bred than the\r\nhead of the Lindons, in his moments of wrath, it would be hard to\r\nconceive. His language I will not attempt to portray,--but his\r\nobservations consisted, mainly, of abuse of Paul, glorification of the\r\nLindons, and orders to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I forbid you--I forbid you--\xe2\x80\x99 when papa wishes to be impressive he\r\nrepeats his own words three or four times over; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he\r\nimagines that they are improved by repetition; if he does, he is\r\nwrong--\xe2\x80\x98I forbid you ever again to speak to that--that--that--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere followed language.\r\n\r\nI was silent.\r\n\r\nMy cue was to keep cool. I believe that, with the exception, perhaps,\r\nof being a little white, and exceedingly sorry that papa should so\r\nforget himself, I was about the same as I generally am.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you hear me?--do you hear what I say?--do you hear me, miss?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, papa; I hear you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then--then--then promise me!--promise that you will do as I tell\r\nyou!--mark my words, my girl, you shall promise before you leave this\r\nroom!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear papa!--do you intend me to spend the remainder of my life in\r\nthe drawing-room?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you be impertinent!--do-do-don\xe2\x80\x99t you speak to me like\r\nthat!--I--I--I won\xe2\x80\x99t have it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I tell you what it is, papa, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t take care you\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nanother attack of gout.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Damn gout.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat was the most sensible thing he said; if such a tormentor as gout\r\ncan be consigned to the nether regions by the mere utterance of a word,\r\nby all means let the word be uttered. Off he went again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The man\xe2\x80\x99s a ruffianly, rascally,--\xe2\x80\x99 and so on. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s not such a\r\nvillainous vagabond--\xe2\x80\x99 and all the rest of it. \xe2\x80\x98And I order you,--I\xe2\x80\x99m a\r\nLindon, and I order you! I\xe2\x80\x99m your father, and I order you!--I order you\r\nnever to speak to such a--such a\xe2\x80\x99--various vain repetitions--\xe2\x80\x98again,\r\nand--and--and I order you never to look at him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Listen to me, papa. I will promise you never to speak to Paul\r\nLessingham again, if you will promise me never to speak to Lord\r\nCantilever again,--or to recognise him if you meet him in the street.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYou should have seen how papa glared. Lord Cantilever is the head of\r\nhis party. Its august, and, I presume, reverenced leader. He is papa\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nparticular fetish. I am not sure that he does regard him as being any\r\nlower than the angels, but if he does it is certainly something in\r\ndecimals. My suggestion seemed as outrageous to him as his suggestion\r\nseemed to me. But it is papa\xe2\x80\x99s misfortune that he can only see one side\r\nof a question,--and that\xe2\x80\x99s his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You--you dare to compare Lord Cantilever to--to that--that--that--!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not comparing them. I am not aware of there being anything in\r\nparticular against Lord Cantilever,--that is against his character.\r\nBut, of course, I should not dream of comparing a man of his calibre,\r\nwith one of real ability, like Paul Lessingham. It would be to treat\r\nhis lordship with too much severity.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI could not help it,--but that did it. The rest of papa\xe2\x80\x99s conversation\r\nwas a jumble of explosions. It was all so sad.\r\n\r\nPapa poured all the vials of his wrath upon Paul,--to his own sore\r\ndisfigurement. He threatened me with all the pains and penalties of the\r\ninquisition if I did not immediately promise to hold no further\r\ncommunication with Mr Lessingham,--of course I did nothing of the kind.\r\nHe cursed me, in default, by bell, book, and candle,--and by ever so\r\nmany other things beside. He called me the most dreadful names,--me!\r\nhis only child. He warned me that I should find myself in prison before\r\nI had done,--I am not sure that he did not hint darkly at the gallows.\r\nFinally, he drove me from the room in a whirlwind of anathemas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXVII.\r\n THE TERROR BY NIGHT\r\n\r\nWhen I left papa,--or, rather, when papa had driven me from him--I went\r\nstraight to the man whom I had found in the street. It was late, and I\r\nwas feeling both tired and worried, so that I only thought of seeing\r\nfor myself how he was. In some way, he seemed to be a link between Paul\r\nand myself, and as, at that moment, links of that kind were precious, I\r\ncould not have gone to bed without learning something of his condition.\r\n\r\nThe nurse received me at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, nurse, how\xe2\x80\x99s the patient?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNurse was a plump, motherly woman, who had attended more than one odd\r\nprot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 of mine, and whom I kept pretty constantly at my beck and call.\r\nShe held out her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to tell. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t moved since I came.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not moved?--Is he still insensible?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He seems to me to be in some sort of trance. He does not appear to\r\nbreathe, and I can detect no pulsation, but the doctor says he\xe2\x80\x99s still\r\nalive,--it\xe2\x80\x99s the queerest case I ever saw.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI went farther into the room. Directly I did so the man in the bed gave\r\nsigns of life which were sufficiently unmistakable. Nurse hastened to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why,\xe2\x80\x99 she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98he\xe2\x80\x99s moving!--he might have heard you enter!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe not only might have done, but it seemed possible that that was what\r\nhe actually had done. As I approached the bed, he raised himself to a\r\nsitting posture, as, in the morning, he had done in the street, and he\r\nexclaimed, as if he addressed himself to someone whom he saw in front\r\nof him,--I cannot describe the almost more than human agony which was\r\nin his voice,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Paul Lessingham!--Beware!--The Beetle!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhat he meant I had not the slightest notion. Probably that was why\r\nwhat seemed more like a pronouncement of delirium than anything else\r\nhad such an extraordinary effect upon my nerves. No sooner had he\r\nspoken than a sort of blank horror seemed to settle down upon my mind.\r\nI actually found myself trembling at the knees. I felt, all at once, as\r\nif I was standing in the immediate presence of something awful yet\r\nunseen.\r\n\r\nAs for the speaker, no sooner were the words out of his lips, than, as\r\nwas the case in the morning, he relapsed into a condition of trance.\r\nNurse, bending over him, announced the fact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s gone off again!--What an extraordinary thing!--I suppose it is\r\nreal.\xe2\x80\x99 It was clear, from the tone of her voice, that she shared the\r\ndoubt which had troubled the policeman. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s not a trace of a\r\npulse. From the look of things he might be dead. Of one thing I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,\r\nthat there\xe2\x80\x99s something unnatural about the man. No natural illness I\r\never heard of, takes hold of a man like this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGlancing up, she saw that there was something unusual in my face; an\r\nappearance which startled her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, Miss Marjorie, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter!--You look quite ill!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI felt ill, and worse than ill; but, at the same time, I was quite\r\nincapable of describing what I felt to nurse. For some inscrutable\r\nreason I had even lost the control of my tongue,--I stammered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I--I--I\xe2\x80\x99m not feeling very well, nurse; I--I--I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll be better\r\nin bed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs I spoke, I staggered towards the door, conscious, all the while,\r\nthat nurse was staring at me with eyes wide open. When I got out of the\r\nroom, it seemed, in some incomprehensible fashion, as if something had\r\nleft it with me, and that It and I were alone together in the corridor.\r\nSo overcome was I by the consciousness of its immediate propinquity,\r\nthat, all at once, I found myself cowering against the wall,--as if I\r\nexpected something or someone to strike me.\r\n\r\nHow I reached my bedroom I do not know. I found Fanchette awaiting me.\r\nFor the moment her presence was a positive comfort,--until I realised\r\nthe amazement with which she was regarding me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mademoiselle is not well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, Fanchette, I--I am rather tired. I will undress myself\r\nto-night--you can go to bed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But if mademoiselle is so tired, will she not permit me to assist her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe suggestion was reasonable enough,--and kindly too; for, to say the\r\nleast of it, she had as much cause for fatigue as I had. I hesitated. I\r\nshould have liked to throw my arms about her neck, and beg her not to\r\nleave me; but, the plain truth is, I was ashamed. In my inner\r\nconsciousness I was persuaded that the sense of terror which had\r\nsuddenly come over me was so absolutely causeless, that I could not\r\nbear the notion of playing the craven in my maid\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. While I\r\nhesitated, something seemed to sweep past me through the air, and to\r\nbrush against my cheek in passing. I caught at Fanchette\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fanchette!--Is there something with us in the room?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Something with us in the room?--Mademoiselle?--What does mademoiselle\r\nmean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe looked disturbed,--which was, on the whole, excusable. Fanchette is\r\nnot exactly a strong-minded person, and not likely to be much of a\r\nsupport when a support was most required. If I was going to play the\r\nfool, I would be my own audience. So I sent her off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you not hear me tell you that I will undress myself?--you are to\r\ngo to bed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe went to bed,--with quite sufficient willingness.\r\n\r\nThe instant that she was out of the room I wished that she was back\r\nagain. Such a paroxysm of fear came over me, that I was incapable of\r\nstirring from the spot on which I stood, and it was all I could do to\r\nprevent myself from collapsing in a heap on the floor. I had never,\r\ntill then, had reason to suppose that I was a coward. Nor to suspect\r\nmyself of being the possessor of \xe2\x80\x98nerves.\xe2\x80\x99 I was as little likely as\r\nanyone to be frightened by shadows. I told myself that the whole thing\r\nwas sheer absurdity, and that I should be thoroughly ashamed of my own\r\nconduct when the morning came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be self-branded as a contemptible idiot, Marjorie\r\nLindon, you will call up your courage, and these foolish fears will\r\nfly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut it would not do. Instead of flying, they grew worse. I became\r\nconvinced,--and the process of conviction was terrible beyond\r\nwords!--that there actually was something with me in the room, some\r\ninvisible horror,--which, at any moment, might become visible. I seemed\r\nto understand--with a sense of agony which nothing can describe!--that\r\nthis thing which was with me was with Paul. That we were linked together\r\nby the bond of a common, and a dreadful terror. That, at that moment,\r\nthat same awful peril which was threatening me, was threatening him,\r\nand that I was powerless to move a finger in his aid. As with a sort of\r\nsecond sight, I saw out of the room in which I was, into another, in\r\nwhich Paul was crouching on the floor, covering his face with his hands,\r\nand shrieking. The vision came again and again with a degree of\r\nvividness of which I cannot give the least conception. At last the\r\nhorror, and the reality of it, goaded me to frenzy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Paul! Paul!\xe2\x80\x99 I screamed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I found my voice, the vision faded. Once more I understood\r\nthat, as a matter of simple fact, I was standing in my own bedroom;\r\nthat the lights were burning brightly; that I had not yet commenced\r\nto remove a particle of dress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Am I going mad?\xe2\x80\x99 I wondered.\r\n\r\nI had heard of insanity taking extraordinary forms, but what could have\r\ncaused softening of the brain in me I had not the faintest notion.\r\nSurely that sort of thing does not come on one--in such a wholly\r\nunmitigated form!--without the slightest notice,--and that my mental\r\nfaculties were sound enough a few minutes back I was certain. The first\r\npremonition of anything of the kind had come upon me with the\r\nmelodramatic utterance of the man I had found in the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Paul Lessingham!--Beware!--The Beetle!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe words were ringing in my ears.--What was that?--There was a\r\nbuzzing sound behind me. I turned to see what it was. It moved as I\r\nmoved, so that it was still at my back. I swung, swiftly, right round\r\non my heels. It still eluded me,--it was still behind.\r\n\r\nI stood and listened,--what was it that hovered so persistently at my\r\nback?\r\n\r\nThe buzzing was distinctly audible. It was like the humming of a bee.\r\nOr--could it be a beetle?\r\n\r\nMy whole life long I have had an antipathy to beetles,--of any sort or\r\nkind. I have objected neither to rats nor mice, nor cows, nor bulls,\r\nnor snakes, nor spiders, nor toads, nor lizards, nor any of the\r\nthousand and one other creatures, animate or otherwise, to which so\r\nmany people have a rooted, and, apparently, illogical dislike. My\r\npet--and only--horror has been beetles. The mere suspicion of a\r\nharmless, and, I am told, necessary cockroach, being within several\r\nfeet has always made me seriously uneasy. The thought that a great,\r\nwinged beetle--to me, a flying beetle is the horror of horrors!--was\r\nwith me in my bedroom,--goodness alone knew how it had got there!--was\r\nunendurable. Anyone who had beheld me during the next few moments would\r\ncertainly have supposed I was deranged. I turned and twisted, sprang\r\nfrom side to side, screwed myself into impossible positions, in order\r\nto obtain a glimpse of the detested visitant,--but in vain. I could\r\nhear it all the time; but see it--never! The buzzing sound was\r\ncontinually behind.\r\n\r\nThe terror returned,--I began to think that my brain must be softening.\r\nI dashed to the bed. Flinging myself on my knees, I tried to pray. But\r\nI was speechless,--words would not come; my thoughts would not take\r\nshape. I all at once became conscious, as I struggled to ask help of\r\nGod, that I was wrestling with something evil,--that if I only could\r\nask help of Him, evil would flee. But I could not. I was\r\nhelpless,--overmastered. I hid my face in the bedclothes, cramming my\r\nfingers into my ears. But the buzzing was behind me all the time.\r\n\r\nI sprang up, striking out, blindly, wildly, right and left, hitting\r\nnothing,--the buzzing always came from a point at which, at the moment,\r\nI was not aiming.\r\n\r\nI tore off my clothes. I had on a lovely frock which I had worn for the\r\nfirst time that night; I had had it specially made for the occasion of\r\nthe Duchess\xe2\x80\x99 ball, and--more especially--in honour of Paul\xe2\x80\x99s great\r\nspeech. I had said to myself, when I saw my image in a mirror, that it\r\nwas the most exquisite gown I had ever had, that it suited me to\r\nperfection, and that it should continue in my wardrobe for many a day,\r\nif only as a souvenir of a memorable night. Now, in the madness of my\r\nterror, all reflections of that sort were forgotten. My only desire was\r\nto away with it. I tore it off anyhow, letting it fall in rags on the\r\nfloor at my feet. All else that I had on I flung in the same way after\r\nit; it was a veritable holocaust of dainty garments,--I acting as\r\nrelentless executioner who am, as a rule, so tender with my things. I\r\nleaped upon the bed, switched off the electric light, hurried into bed,\r\nburying myself, over head and all, deep down between the sheets.\r\n\r\nI had hoped that by shutting out the light, I might regain my senses.\r\nThat in the darkness I might have opportunity for sane reflection. But\r\nI had made a grievous error. I had exchanged bad for worse. The\r\ndarkness lent added terrors. The light had not been out five seconds\r\nbefore I would have given all that I was worth to be able to switch it\r\non again.\r\n\r\nAs I cowered beneath the bedclothes I heard the buzzing sound above my\r\nhead,--the sudden silence of the darkness had rendered it more audible\r\nthan it had been before. The thing, whatever it was, was hovering above\r\nthe bed. It came nearer and nearer; it grew clearer and clearer. I felt\r\nit alight upon the coverlet;--shall I ever forget the sensations with\r\nwhich I did feel it? It weighed upon me like a ton of lead. How much of\r\nthe seeming weight was real, and how much imaginary, I cannot pretend\r\nto say; but that it was much heavier than any beetle I have ever seen\r\nor heard of, I am sure.\r\n\r\nFor a time it was still,--and during that time I doubt if I even drew\r\nmy breath. Then I felt it begin to move, in wobbling fashion, with\r\nawkward, ungainly gait, stopping every now and then, as if for rest. I\r\nwas conscious that it was progressing, slowly, yet surely, towards the\r\nhead of the bed. The emotion of horror with which I realised what this\r\nprogression might mean, will be, I fear, with me to the end of my\r\nlife,--not only in dreams, but too often, also, in my waking hours. My\r\nheart, as the Psalmist has it, melted like wax within me. I was\r\nincapable of movement,--dominated by something as hideous as, and\r\ninfinitely more powerful than, the fascination of the serpent.\r\n\r\nWhen it reached the head of the bed, what I feared--with what a\r\nfear!--would happen, did happen. It began to find its way inside,--to\r\ncreep between the sheets; the wonder is I did not die! I felt it coming\r\nnearer and nearer, inch by inch; I knew that it was upon me, that\r\nescape there was none; I felt something touch my hair.\r\n\r\nAnd then oblivion did come to my aid. For the first time in my life I\r\nswooned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n THE STRANGE STORY OF THE MAN IN THE STREET\r\n\r\nI have been anticipating for some weeks past, that things would become\r\nexciting,--and they have. But hardly in the way which I foresaw. It is\r\nthe old story of the unexpected happening. Suddenly events of the most\r\nextraordinary nature have come crowding on me from the most\r\nunlooked-for quarters.\r\n\r\nLet me try to take them in something like their proper order.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, Sydney has behaved very badly. So badly that it seems\r\nlikely that I shall have to re-cast my whole conception of his\r\ncharacter. It was nearly nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock this morning when I,--I cannot\r\nsay woke up, because I do not believe that I had really been\r\nasleep--but when I returned to consciousness. I found myself sitting up\r\nin bed, trembling like some frightened child. What had actually\r\nhappened to me I did not know,--could not guess. I was conscious of an\r\noverwhelming sense of nausea, and, generally, I was feeling very far\r\nfrom well. I endeavoured to arrange my thoughts, and to decide upon\r\nsome plan of action. Finally, I decided to go for advice and help where\r\nI had so often gone before,--to Sydney Atherton.\r\n\r\nI went to him. I told him the whole gruesome story. He saw, he could\r\nnot help but see what a deep impress the events of the night had made\r\non me. He heard me to the end with every appearance of sympathy,--and\r\nthen all at once I discovered that all the time papa had been concealed\r\nbehind a large screen which was in the room, listening to every word I\r\nhad been uttering. That I was dumfoundered, goes without saying. It was\r\nbad enough in papa, but in Sydney it seemed, and it was, such\r\ntreachery. He and I have told each other secrets all our lives; it has\r\nnever entered my imagination, as he very well knows, to play him false,\r\nin one jot or tittle; and I have always understood that, in this sort\r\nof matter, men pride themselves on their sense of honour being so much\r\nkeener than women\xe2\x80\x99s. I told them some plain truths; and I fancy that I\r\nleft them both feeling heartily ashamed of themselves.\r\n\r\nOne result the experience had on me,--it wound me up. It had on me the\r\nrevivifying effect of a cold douche. I realised that mine was a\r\nsituation in which I should have to help myself.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned home I learned that the man whom I had found in the\r\nstreet was himself again, and was as conscious as he was ever likely to\r\nbe. Burning with curiosity to learn the nature of the connection which\r\nexisted between Paul and him, and what was the meaning of his oracular\r\napostrophes, I merely paused to remove my hat before hastening into his\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw me, and heard who I was, the expressions of his gratitude\r\nwere painful in their intensity. The tears streamed down his cheeks. He\r\nlooked to me like a man who had very little life left in him. He looked\r\nweak, and white, and worn to a shadow. Probably he never had been\r\nrobust, and it was only too plain that privation had robbed him of what\r\nlittle strength he had ever had. He was nothing else but skin and bone.\r\nPhysical and mental debility was written large all over him.\r\n\r\nHe was not bad-looking,--in a milk and watery sort of way. He had pale\r\nblue eyes and very fair hair, and, I daresay, at one time, had been a\r\nspruce enough clerk. It was difficult to guess his age, one ages so\r\nrapidly under the stress of misfortune, but I should have set him down\r\nas being about forty. His voice, though faint enough at first, was that\r\nof an educated man, and as he went on, and gathered courage, and became\r\nmore and more in earnest, he spoke with a simple directness which was\r\nclose akin to eloquence. It was a curious story which he had to tell.\r\n\r\nSo curious, so astounding indeed, that, by the time it was finished, I\r\nwas in such a state of mind, that I could perceive no alternative but\r\nto forgive Sydney, and, in spite of his recent, and scandalous\r\nmisbehaviour, again appeal to him for assistance. It seemed, if the\r\nstory told by the man whom I had found in the street was true,--and\r\nincredible though it sounded, he spoke like a truthful man!--that Paul\r\nwas threatened by some dreadful, and, to me, wholly incomprehensible\r\ndanger; that it was a case in which even moments were precious; and I\r\nfelt that, with the best will in the world, it was a position in which\r\nI could not move alone. The shadow of the terror of the night was with\r\nme still, and with that fresh in my recollection how could I hope,\r\nsingle-handed, to act effectually against the mysterious being of whom\r\nthis amazing tale was told? No! I believed that Sydney did care for me,\r\nin his own peculiar way; I knew that he was quick, and cool, and\r\nfertile in resource, and that he showed to most advantage in a\r\ndifficult situation; it was possible that he had a conscience, of a\r\nsort, and that, this time, I might not appeal to it in vain.\r\n\r\nSo I sent a servant off to fetch him, helter skelter.\r\n\r\nAs luck would have it, the servant returned with him within five\r\nminutes. It appeared that he had been lunching with Dora Grayling, who\r\nlives just at the end of the street, and the footman had met him coming\r\ndown the steps. I had him shown into my own room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I want you to go to the man whom I found in the street, and listen to\r\nwhat he has to say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With pleasure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can I trust you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To listen to what he has to say?--I believe so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can I trust you to respect my confidence?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was not at all abashed,--I never saw Sydney Atherton when he was\r\nabashed. Whatever the offence of which he has been guilty, he always\r\nseems completely at his ease. His eyes twinkled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can,--I will not breathe a syllable even to papa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In that case, come! But, you understand, I am going to put to the test\r\nthe affirmations which you have made during all these years, and to\r\nprove if you have any of the feeling for me which you pretend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDirectly we were in the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s room, Sydney marched straight up to\r\nthe bed, stared at the man who was lying in it, crammed his hands into\r\nhis trouser pockets, and whistled. I was amazed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So!\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know this man?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am hardly prepared to go so far as to say that I know him, but, I\r\nchance to have a memory for faces, and it happens that I have met this\r\ngentleman on at least one previous occasion. Perhaps he remembers\r\nme.--Do you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe stranger seemed uneasy,--as if he found Sydney\xe2\x80\x99s tone and manner\r\ndisconcerting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do. You are the man in the street.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Precisely. I am that--individual. And you are the man who came through\r\nthe window. And in a much more comfortable condition you appear to be\r\nthan when first I saw you.\xe2\x80\x99 Sydney turned to me. \xe2\x80\x98It is just possible,\r\nMiss Lindon, that I may have a few remarks to make to this gentleman\r\nwhich would be better made in private,--if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I do mind,--I mind very much. What do you suppose I sent for you\r\nhere for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSydney smiled that absurd, provoking smile of his,--as if the occasion\r\nwere not sufficiently serious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To show that you still repose in me a vestige of your confidence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk nonsense. This man has told me a most extraordinary story,\r\nand I have sent for you--as you may believe, not too willingly\xe2\x80\x99--Sydney\r\nbowed--\xe2\x80\x98in order that he may repeat it in your presence, and in mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that so?--Well!--Permit me to offer you a chair,--this tale may turn\r\nout to be a trifle long.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo humour him I accepted the chair he offered, though I should have\r\npreferred to stand;--he seated himself on the side of the bed, fixing\r\non the stranger those keen, quizzical, not too merciful, eyes of his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, sir, we are at your service,--if you will be so good as to\r\nfavour us with a second edition of that pleasant yarn you have been\r\nspinning. But--let us begin at the right end!--what\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My name is Robert Holt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That so?--Then, Mr Robert Holt,--let her go!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, Mr Holt repeated the tale which he had told me, only\r\nin more connected fashion than before. I fancy that Sydney\xe2\x80\x99s glances\r\nexercised on him a sort of hypnotic effect, and this kept him to the\r\npoint,--he scarcely needed a word of prompting from the first syllable\r\nto the last.\r\n\r\nHe told how, tired, wet, hungry, desperate, despairing, he had been\r\nrefused admittance to the casual ward,--that unfailing resource, as one\r\nwould have supposed, of those who had abandoned even hope. How he had\r\ncome upon an open window in an apparently empty house, and, thinking of\r\nnothing but shelter from the inclement night, he had clambered through\r\nit. How he had found himself in the presence of an extraordinary being,\r\nwho, in his debilitated and nervous state, had seemed to him to be only\r\nhalf human. How this dreadful creature had given utterance to wild\r\nsentiments of hatred towards Paul Lessingham,--my Paul! How he had\r\ntaken advantage of Holt\xe2\x80\x99s enfeebled state to gain over him the most\r\ncomplete, horrible, and, indeed, almost incredible ascendency. How he\r\nactually had sent Holt, practically naked, into the storm-driven\r\nstreets, to commit burglary at Paul\xe2\x80\x99s house,--and how he,--Holt,--had\r\nactually gone without being able to offer even a shadow of opposition.\r\nHow Paul, suddenly returning home, had come upon Holt engaged in the\r\nvery act of committing burglary, and how, on his hearing Holt make a\r\ncabalistic reference to some mysterious beetle, the manhood had gone\r\nout of him, and he had suffered the intruder to make good his escape\r\nwithout an effort to detain him.\r\n\r\nThe story had seemed sufficiently astonishing the first time, it seemed\r\nstill more astonishing the second,--but, as I watched Sydney listening,\r\nwhat struck me chiefly was the conviction that he had heard it all\r\nbefore. I charged him with it directly Holt had finished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is not the first time you have been told this tale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me,--but it is. Do you suppose I live in an atmosphere of fairy\r\ntales?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSomething in his manner made me feel sure he was deceiving me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sydney!--Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me a story!--Paul has told you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not telling you a story,--at least, on this occasion; and Mr\r\nLessingham has not told me. Suppose we postpone these details to a\r\nlittle later. And perhaps, in the interim, you will permit me to put a\r\nquestion or two to Mr Holt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI let him have his way,--though I knew he was concealing something from\r\nme; that he had a more intimate acquaintance with Mr Holt\xe2\x80\x99s strange\r\ntale than he chose to confess. And, for some cause, his reticence\r\nannoyed me.\r\n\r\nHe looked at Mr Holt in silence for a second or two. Then he said, with\r\nthe quizzical little air of bland impertinence which is peculiarly his\r\nown,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I presume, Mr Holt, you have been entertaining us with a novelty in\r\nfables, and that we are not expected to believe this pleasant little\r\nyarn of yours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I expect nothing. But I have told you the truth. And you know it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis seemed to take Sydney aback.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I protest that, like Miss Lindon, you credit me with a more extensive\r\nknowledge than I possess. However, we will let that pass.--I take it\r\nthat you paid particular attention to this mysterious habitant of this\r\nmysterious dwelling.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI saw that Mr Holt shuddered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not likely ever to forget him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then, in that case, you will be able to describe him to us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To do so adequately would be beyond my powers. But I will do my best.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIf the original was more remarkable than the description which he gave\r\nof him, then he must have been remarkable indeed. The impression\r\nconveyed to my mind was rather of a monster than a human being. I\r\nwatched Sydney attentively as he followed Mr Holt\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat lurid\r\nlanguage, and there was something in his demeanour which made me more\r\nand more persuaded that he was more behind the scenes in this strange\r\nbusiness than he pretended, or than the speaker suspected. He put a\r\nquestion which seemed uncalled for by anything which Mr Holt had said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are sure this thing of beauty was a man?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir, that is exactly what I am not sure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a note in Sydney\xe2\x80\x99s voice which suggested that he had received\r\nprecisely the answer which he had expected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you think it was a woman?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did think so, more than once. Though I can hardly explain what made\r\nme think so. There was certainly nothing womanly about the face.\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\npaused, as if to reflect. Then added, \xe2\x80\x98I suppose it was a question of\r\ninstinct.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see.--Just so.--It occurs to me, Mr Holt, that you are rather strong\r\non questions of instinct.\xe2\x80\x99 Sydney got off the bed. He stretched\r\nhimself, as if fatigued,--which is a way he has. \xe2\x80\x98I will not do you the\r\ninjustice to hint that I do not believe a word of your charming, and\r\nsimple, narrative. On the contrary, I will demonstrate my perfect\r\ncredence by remarking that I have not the slightest doubt that you will\r\nbe able to point out to me, for my particular satisfaction, the\r\ndelightful residence on which the whole is founded.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Holt coloured,--Sydney\xe2\x80\x99s tone could scarcely have been more\r\nsignificant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must remember, sir, that it was a dark night, that I had never\r\nbeen in that neighbourhood before, and that I was not in a condition to\r\npay much attention to locality.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All of which is granted, but--how far was it from Hammersmith\r\nWorkhouse?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Possibly under half a mile.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then, in that case, surely you can remember which turning you took on\r\nleaving Hammersmith Workhouse,--I suppose there are not many turnings\r\nyou could have taken.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think I could remember.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you shall have an opportunity to try. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t a very far cry to\r\nHammersmith,--don\xe2\x80\x99t you think you are well enough to drive there now,\r\njust you and I together in a cab?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should say so. I wished to get up this morning. It is by the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s orders I have stayed in bed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then, for once in a while, the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s orders shall be ignored,--I\r\nprescribe fresh air.\xe2\x80\x99 Sydney turned to me. \xe2\x80\x98Since Mr Holt\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe\r\nseems rather to seek, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think a suit of one of the men might\r\nfit him,--if Mr Holt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind making shift for the moment?--Then,\r\nby the time you\xe2\x80\x99ve finished dressing, Mr Holt, I shall be ready.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhile they were ascertaining which suit of clothes would be best\r\nadapted to his figure, I went with Sydney to my room. So soon as we\r\nwere in, I let him know that this was not a matter in which I intended\r\nto be trifled with.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course you understand, Sydney, that I am coming with you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe pretended not to know what I meant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Coming with me?--I am delighted to hear it,--but where?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To the house of which Mr Holt has been speaking.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing could give me greater pleasure, but--might I point out?--Mr\r\nHolt has to find it yet?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will come to help you to help him find it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSydney laughed,--but I could see he did not altogether relish the\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Three in a hansom?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is such a thing as a four-wheeled cab,--or I could order a\r\ncarriage if you\xe2\x80\x99d like one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSydney looked at me out of the corners of his eyes; then began to walk\r\nup and down the room, with his hands in his trouser pockets. Presently\r\nhe began to talk nonsense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I need not say with what a sensation of joy I should anticipate the\r\ndelights of a drive with you,--even in a four-wheeled cab; but, were I\r\nin your place, I fancy that I should allow Holt and your humble servant\r\nto go hunting out this house of his alone. It may prove a more tedious\r\nbusiness than you imagine. I promise that, after the hunt is over, I\r\nwill describe the proceedings to you with the most literal accuracy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I daresay.--Do you think I don\xe2\x80\x99t know you\xe2\x80\x99ve been deceiving me all the\r\ntime?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Deceiving you?--I!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,--you! Do you think I\xe2\x80\x99m quite an idiot?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Marjorie!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think I can\xe2\x80\x99t see that you know all about what Mr Holt has been\r\ntelling us,--perhaps more about it than he knows himself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On my word!--With what an amount of knowledge you do credit me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I do,--or discredit you, rather. If I were to trust you, you\r\nwould tell me just as much as you chose,--which would be nothing. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ncoming with you,--so there\xe2\x80\x99s an end.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well.--Do you happen to know if there are any revolvers in the\r\nhouse?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Revolvers?--whatever for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because I should like to borrow one. I will not conceal from\r\nyou--since you press me--that this is a case in which a revolver is\r\nquite likely to be required.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are trying to frighten me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am doing nothing of the kind, only, under the circumstances, I am\r\nbound to point out to you what it is you may expect.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, you think that you\xe2\x80\x99re bound to point that out, do you,--then now\r\nyour bounden duty\xe2\x80\x99s done. As for there being any revolvers in the\r\nhouse, papa has a perfect arsenal,--would you like to take them all?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thanks, but I daresay I shall be able to manage with one,--unless you\r\nwould like one too. You may find yourself in need of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am obliged to you, but, on this occasion, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntrouble. I\xe2\x80\x99ll run the risk.--Oh, Sydney, what a hypocrite you are!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s for your sake, if I seem to be. I tell you most seriously, that I\r\nearnestly advise you to allow Mr Holt and I to manage this affair\r\nalone. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind going so far as to say that this is a matter with\r\nwhich, in days to come, you will wish that you had not allowed yourself\r\nto be associated.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean by that? Do you dare to insinuate anything\r\nagainst--Paul?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I insinuate nothing. What I mean, I say right out; and, my dear\r\nMarjorie, what I actually do mean is this,--that if, in spite of my\r\nurgent solicitations, you will persist in accompanying us, the\r\nexpedition, so far as I am concerned, will be postponed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is what you do mean, is it? Then that\xe2\x80\x99s settled.\xe2\x80\x99 I rang the\r\nbell. The servant came. \xe2\x80\x98Order a four-wheeled cab at once. And let me\r\nknow the moment Mr Holt is ready.\xe2\x80\x99 The servant went. I turned to\r\nSydney. \xe2\x80\x98If you will excuse me, I will go and put my hat on. You are,\r\nof course, at liberty to please yourself as to whether you will or will\r\nnot go, but, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t, then I shall go with Mr Holt alone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI moved to the door. He stopped me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Marjorie, why will you persist in treating me with such\r\ninjustice? Believe me, you have no idea what sort of adventure this is\r\nwhich you are setting out upon,--or you would hear reason. I assure you\r\nthat you are gratuitously proposing to thrust yourself into imminent\r\nperil.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What sort of peril? Why do you beat about the bush,--why don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nspeak right out?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak right out, there are circumstances which render it\r\npractically impossible--and that\xe2\x80\x99s the plain truth,--but the danger is\r\nnone the less real on that account. I am not jesting,--I am in earnest;\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t you take my word for it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not a question of taking your word only,--it is a question of\r\nsomething else beside. I have not forgotten my adventures of last\r\nnight,--and Mr Holt\xe2\x80\x99s story is mysterious enough in itself; but there\r\nis something more mysterious still at the back of it,--something which\r\nyou appear to suggest points unpleasantly at Paul. My duty is clear,\r\nand nothing you can say will turn me from it. Paul, as you are very\r\nwell aware, is already overweighted with affairs of state, pretty\r\nnearly borne down by them,--or I would take the tale to him, and he\r\nwould talk to you after a fashion of his own. Things being as they are,\r\nI propose to show you that, although I am not yet Paul\xe2\x80\x99s wife, I can\r\nmake his interests my own as completely as though I were. I can,\r\ntherefore, only repeat that it is for you to decide what you intend to\r\ndo; but, if you prefer to stay, I shall go with Mr Holt,--alone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Understand that, when the time for regret comes--as it will come!--you\r\nare not to blame me for having done what I advised you not to do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Mr Atherton, I will undertake to do my utmost to guard your\r\nspotless reputation; I should be sorry that anyone should hold you\r\nresponsible for anything I either said or did.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well!--Your blood be on your own head!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My blood?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,--your blood. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if it comes to blood before\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re through.--Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll oblige me with the loan of one of that\r\narsenal of revolvers of which you spoke.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI let him have his old revolver,--or, rather, I let him have one of\r\npapa\xe2\x80\x99s new ones. He put it in the hip pocket in his trousers. And the\r\nexpedition started,--in a four-wheeled cab.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXIX.\r\n THE HOUSE ON THE ROAD FROM THE WORKHOUSE\r\n\r\nMr Holt looked as if he was in somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s garments. He was so\r\nthin, and worn, and wasted, that the suit of clothes which one of the\r\nmen had lent him hung upon him as on a scarecrow. I was almost ashamed\r\nof myself for having incurred a share of the responsibility of taking\r\nhim out of bed. He seemed so weak and bloodless that I should not have\r\nbeen surprised if he had fainted on the road. I had taken care that he\r\nshould eat as much as he could eat before we started--the suggestion of\r\nstarvation which he had conveyed to one\xe2\x80\x99s mind was dreadful!--and I had\r\nbrought a flask of brandy in case of accidents, but, in spite of\r\neverything, I could not conceal from myself that he would be more at\r\nhome in a sick-bed than in a jolting cab.\r\n\r\nIt was not a cheerful drive. There was in Sydney\xe2\x80\x99s manner towards me an\r\nair of protection which I instinctively resented,--he appeared to be\r\nregarding me as a careful, and anxious, nurse might regard a\r\nwrong-headed and disobedient child. Conversation distinctly languished.\r\nSince Sydney seemed disposed to patronise me, I was bent on snubbing\r\nhim. The result was, that the majority of the remarks which were\r\nuttered were addressed to Mr Holt.\r\n\r\nThe cab stopped,--after what had appeared to me to be an interminable\r\njourney. I was rejoiced at the prospect of its being at an end. Sydney\r\nput his head out of the window. A short parley with the driver ensued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is \xe2\x80\x99Ammersmith Workhouse, it\xe2\x80\x99s a large place, sir,--which part of\r\nit might you be wanting?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSydney appealed to Mr Holt. He put his head out of the window in his\r\nturn,--he did not seem to recognise our surroundings at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We have come a different way,--this is not the way I went; I went\r\nthrough Hammersmith,--and to the casual ward; I don\xe2\x80\x99t see that here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSydney spoke to the cabman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Driver, where\xe2\x80\x99s the casual ward?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the other end, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then take us there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe took us there. Then Sydney appealed again to Mr Holt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall I dismiss the cabman,--or don\xe2\x80\x99t you feel equal to walking?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, I feel quite equal to walking,--I think the exercise will\r\ndo me good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo the cabman was dismissed,--a step which we--and I, in\r\nparticular--had subsequent cause to regret. Mr Holt took his bearings.\r\nHe pointed to a door which was just in front of us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the entrance to the casual ward, and that, over it, is the\r\nwindow through which the other man threw a stone. I went to the\r\nright,--back the way I had come.\xe2\x80\x99 We went to the right. \xe2\x80\x98I reached this\r\ncorner.\xe2\x80\x99 We had reached a corner. Mr Holt looked about him,\r\nendeavouring to recall the way he had gone. A good many roads appeared\r\nto converge at that point, so that he might have wandered in either of\r\nseveral directions.\r\n\r\nPresently he arrived at something like a decision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think this is the way I went,--I am nearly sure it is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe led the way, with something of an air of dubitation, and we\r\nfollowed. The road he had chosen seemed to lead to nothing and nowhere.\r\nWe had not gone many yards from the workhouse gates before we were\r\nconfronted by something like chaos. In front and on either side of us\r\nwere large spaces of waste land. At some more or less remote period\r\nattempts appeared to have been made at brickmaking,--there were untidy\r\nstacks of bilious-looking bricks in evidence. Here and there enormous\r\nweather-stained boards announced that \xe2\x80\x98This Desirable Land was to be\r\nLet for Building Purposes.\xe2\x80\x99 The road itself was unfinished. There was\r\nno pavement, and we had the bare uneven ground for sidewalk. It seemed,\r\nso far as I could judge, to lose itself in space, and to be swallowed\r\nup by the wilderness of \xe2\x80\x98Desirable Land\xe2\x80\x99 which lay beyond. In the near\r\ndistance there were houses enough, and to spare--of a kind. But they\r\nwere in other roads. In the one in which we actually were, on the\r\nright, at the end, there was a row of unfurnished carcases, but only\r\ntwo buildings which were in anything like a fit state for occupation.\r\nOne stood on either side, not facing each other,--there was a distance\r\nbetween them of perhaps fifty yards. The sight of them had a more\r\nexciting effect on Mr Holt than it had on me. He moved rapidly\r\nforward,--coming to a standstill in front of the one upon our left,\r\nwhich was the nearer of the pair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is the house!\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nHe seemed almost exhilarated,--I confess that I was depressed. A more\r\ndismal-looking habitation one could hardly imagine. It was one of those\r\ndreadful jerry-built houses which, while they are still new, look old.\r\nIt had quite possibly only been built a year or two, and yet, owing to\r\nneglect, or to poverty of construction, or to a combination of the two,\r\nit was already threatening to tumble down. It was a small place, a\r\ncouple of storeys high, and would have been dear--I should think!--at\r\nthirty pounds a year. The windows had surely never been washed since\r\nthe house was built,--those on the upper floor seemed all either\r\ncracked or broken. The only sign of occupancy consisted in the fact\r\nthat a blind was down behind the window of the room on the ground\r\nfloor. Curtains there were none. A low wall ran in front, which had\r\napparently at one time been surmounted by something in the shape of an\r\niron railing,--a rusty piece of metal still remained on one end; but,\r\nsince there was only about a foot between it and the building, which\r\nwas practically built upon the road,--whether the wall was intended to\r\nensure privacy, or was merely for ornament, was not clear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is the house!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr Holt, showing more signs of life than\r\nI had hitherto seen in him.\r\n\r\nSydney looked it up and down,--it apparently appealed to his aesthetic\r\nsense as little as it did to mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you sure?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am certain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It seems empty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It seemed empty to me that night,--that is why I got into it in search\r\nof shelter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which is the window which served you as a door?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This one.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Holt pointed to the window on the ground floor,--the one\r\nwhich was screened by a blind. \xe2\x80\x98There was no sign of a blind when I\r\nfirst saw it, and the sash was up,--it was that which caught my eye.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOnce more Sydney surveyed the place, in comprehensive fashion, from\r\nroof to basement,--then he scrutinisingly regarded Mr Holt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are quite sure this is the house? It might be awkward if you\r\nproved mistaken. I am going to knock at the door, and if it turns out\r\nthat that mysterious acquaintance of yours does not, and never has\r\nlived here, we might find an explanation difficult.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure it is the house,--certain! I know it,--I feel it here,--and\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Holt touched his breast, and his forehead. His manner was distinctly\r\nodd. He was trembling, and a fevered expression had come into his eyes.\r\nSydney glanced at him, for a moment, in silence. Then he bestowed his\r\nattention upon me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May I ask if I may rely upon your preserving your presence of mind?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe mere question ruffled my plumes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What I say. I am going to knock at that door, and I am going to get\r\nthrough it, somehow. It is quite within the range of possibility that,\r\nwhen I am through, there will be some strange happenings,--as you have\r\nheard from Mr Holt. The house is commonplace enough without; you may\r\nnot find it so commonplace within. You may find yourself in a position\r\nin which it will be in the highest degree essential that you should\r\nkeep your wits about you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not likely to let them stray.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then that\xe2\x80\x99s all right.--Do I understand that you propose to come in\r\nwith me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course I do,--what do you suppose I\xe2\x80\x99ve come for? What nonsense you\r\nare talking.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope that you will still continue to consider it nonsense by the\r\ntime this little adventure\xe2\x80\x99s done.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat I resented his impertinence goes without saying--to be talked to\r\nin such a strain by Sydney Atherton, whom I had kept in subjection ever\r\nsince he was in knickerbockers, was a little trying,--but I am forced\r\nto admit that I was more impressed by his manner, or his words, or by\r\nMr Holt\xe2\x80\x99s manner, or something, than I should have cared to own. I had\r\nnot the least notion what was going to happen, or what horrors that\r\nwoebegone-looking dwelling contained. But Mr Holt\xe2\x80\x99s story had been of\r\nthe most astonishing sort, my experiences of the previous night were\r\nstill fresh, and, altogether, now that I was in such close\r\nneighbourhood with the Unknown--with a capital U!--although it was\r\nbroad daylight, it loomed before me in a shape for which,--candidly!--I\r\nwas not prepared.\r\n\r\nA more disreputable-looking front door I have not seen,--it was in\r\nperfect harmony with the remainder of the establishment. The paint was\r\noff; the woodwork was scratched and dented; the knocker was red with\r\nrust. When Sydney took it in his hand I was conscious of quite a little\r\nthrill. As he brought it down with a sharp rat-tat, I half expected to\r\nsee the door fly open, and disclose some gruesome object glaring out at\r\nus. Nothing of the kind took place; the door did not budge,--nothing\r\nhappened. Sydney waited a second or two, then knocked again; another\r\nsecond or two, then another knock. There was still no sign of any\r\nnotice being taken of our presence. Sydney turned to Mr Holt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Seems as if the place was empty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Holt was in the most singular condition of agitation,--it made me\r\nuncomfortable to look at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You do not know,--you cannot tell; there may be someone there who\r\nhears and pays no heed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll give them another chance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSydney brought down the knocker with thundering reverberations. The din\r\nmust have been audible half a mile away. But from within the house\r\nthere was still no sign that any heard. Sydney came down the step.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll try another way,--I may have better fortune at the back.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe led the way round to the rear, Mr Holt and I following in single\r\nfile. There the place seemed in worse case even than in the front.\r\nThere were two empty rooms on the ground floor at the back,--there was\r\nno mistake about their being empty, without the slightest difficulty we\r\ncould see right into them. One was apparently intended for a kitchen\r\nand wash-house combined, the other for a sitting-room. There was not a\r\nstick of furniture in either, nor the slightest sign of human\r\nhabitation. Sydney commented on the fact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not only is it plain that no one lives in these charming apartments,\r\nbut it looks to me uncommonly as if no one ever had lived in them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo my thinking Mr Holt\xe2\x80\x99s agitation was increasing every moment. For\r\nsome reason of his own, Sydney took no notice of it whatever,--possibly\r\nbecause he judged that to do so would only tend to make it worse. An\r\nodd change had even taken place in Mr Holt\xe2\x80\x99s voice,--he spoke in a sort\r\nof tremulous falsetto.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was only the front room which I saw.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good; then, before very long, you shall see that front room\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSydney rapped with his knuckles on the glass panels of the back door.\r\nHe tried the handle; when it refused to yield he gave it a vigorous\r\nshaking. He saluted the dirty windows,--so far as succeeding in\r\nattracting attention was concerned, entirely in vain. Then he turned\r\nagain to Mr Holt,--half mockingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I call you to witness that I have used every lawful means to gain the\r\nfavourable notice of your mysterious friend. I must therefore beg to\r\nstand excused if I try something slightly unlawful for a change. It is\r\ntrue that you found the window already open; but, in my case, it soon\r\nwill be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe took a knife out of his pocket, and, with the open blade, forced\r\nback the catch,--as I am told that burglars do. Then he lifted the sash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Behold!\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x98What did I tell you?--Now, my dear Marjorie,\r\nif I get in first and Mr Holt gets in after me, we shall be in a\r\nposition to open the door for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI immediately saw through his design.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Mr Atherton; you will get in first, and I will get in after you,\r\nthrough the window,--before Mr Holt. I don\xe2\x80\x99t intend to wait for you to\r\nopen the door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSydney raised his hands and opened his eyes, as if grieved at my want\r\nof confidence. But I did not mean to be left in the lurch, to wait\r\ntheir pleasure, while on pretence of opening the door, they searched\r\nthe house. So Sydney climbed in first, and I second,--it was not a\r\ndifficult operation, since the window-sill was under three feet from\r\nthe ground--and Mr Holt last. Directly we were in, Sydney put his hand\r\nup to his mouth, and shouted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is there anybody in this house? If so, will he kindly step this way,\r\nas there is someone wishes to see him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis words went echoing through the empty rooms in a way which was\r\nalmost uncanny. I suddenly realised that if, after all, there did\r\nhappen to be somebody in the house, and he was at all disagreeable, our\r\npresence on his premises might prove rather difficult to explain.\r\nHowever, no one answered. While I was waiting for Sydney to make the\r\nnext move, he diverted my attention to Mr Holt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo, Holt, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you? Man, don\xe2\x80\x99t play the fool like\r\nthat!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSomething was the matter with Mr Holt. He was trembling all over as if\r\nattacked by a shaking palsy. Every muscle in his body seemed twitching\r\nat once. A strained look had come on his face, which was not nice to\r\nsee. He spoke as with an effort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m all right.--It\xe2\x80\x99s nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, is it nothing? Then perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll drop it. Where\xe2\x80\x99s that brandy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI handed Sydney the flask. \xe2\x80\x98Here, swallow this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Holt swallowed the cupful of neat spirit which Sydney offered\r\nwithout an attempt at parley. Beyond bringing some remnants of colour\r\nto his ashen cheeks it seemed to have no effect on him whatever. Sydney\r\neyed him with a meaning in his glance which I was at a loss to\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Listen to me, my lad. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can deceive me by playing any of\r\nyour fool tricks, and don\xe2\x80\x99t delude yourself into supposing that I shall\r\ntreat you as anything but dangerous if you do. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got this.\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\nshowed the revolver of papa\xe2\x80\x99s which I had lent him. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that\r\nMiss Lindon\xe2\x80\x99s presence will deter me from using it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhy he addressed Mr Holt in such a strain surpassed my comprehension.\r\nMr Holt, however, evinced not the faintest symptoms of resentment,--he\r\nhad become, on a sudden, more like an automaton than a man. Sydney\r\ncontinued to gaze at him as if he would have liked his glance to\r\npenetrate to his inmost soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Keep in front of me, if you please, Mr Holt, and lead the way to this\r\nmysterious apartment in which you claim to have had such a remarkable\r\nexperience.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOf me he asked in a whisper,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you bring a revolver?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI was startled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A revolver?--The idea!--How absurd you are!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSydney said something which was so rude--and so uncalled for!--that it\r\nwas worthy of papa in his most violent moments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner be absurd than a fool in petticoats.\xe2\x80\x99 I was so angry that I\r\ndid not know what to say,--and before I could say it he went on. \xe2\x80\x98Keep\r\nyour eyes and ears well open; be surprised at nothing you see or hear.\r\nStick close to me. And for goodness sake remain mistress of as many of\r\nyour senses as you conveniently can.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI had not the least idea what was the meaning of it all. To me there\r\nseemed nothing to make such a pother about. And yet I was conscious of\r\na fluttering of the heart as if there soon might be something. I knew\r\nSydney sufficiently well to be aware that he was one of the last men in\r\nthe world to make a fuss without reason,--and that he was as little\r\nlikely to suppose that there was a reason when as a matter of fact\r\nthere was none.\r\n\r\nMr Holt led the way, as Sydney desired--or, rather, commanded, to the\r\ndoor of the room which was in front of the house. The door was closed.\r\nSydney tapped on a panel. All was silence. He tapped again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anyone in there?\xe2\x80\x99 he demanded.\r\n\r\nAs there was still no answer, he tried the handle. The door was locked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The first sign of the presence of a human being we have had,--doors\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t lock themselves. It\xe2\x80\x99s just possible that there may have been\r\nsomeone or something about the place, at some time or other, after all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGrasping the handle firmly, he shook it with all his might,--as he had\r\ndone with the door at the back. So flimsily was the place constructed\r\nthat he made even the walls to tremble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Within there!--if anyone is in there!--if you don\xe2\x80\x99t open this door, I\r\nshall.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was no response.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So be it!--I\xe2\x80\x99m going to pursue my wild career of defiance of\r\nestablished law and order, and gain admission in one way, if I can\xe2\x80\x99t in\r\nanother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPutting his right shoulder against the door, he pushed with his whole\r\nforce. Sydney is a big man, and very strong, and the door was weak.\r\nShortly, the lock yielded before the continuous pressure, and the door\r\nflew open. Sydney whistled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So!--It begins to occur to me, Mr Holt, that that story of yours may\r\nnot have been such pure romance as it seemed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was plain enough that, at any rate, this room had been occupied, and\r\nthat recently,--and, if his taste in furniture could be taken as a\r\ntest, by an eccentric occupant to boot. My own first impression was\r\nthat there was someone, or something, living in it still,--an\r\nuncomfortable odour greeted our nostrils, which was suggestive of some\r\nevil-smelling animal. Sydney seemed to share my thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A pretty perfume, on my word! Let\xe2\x80\x99s shed a little more light on the\r\nsubject, and see what causes it. Marjorie, stop where you are until I\r\ntell you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI had noticed nothing, from without, peculiar about the appearance of\r\nthe blind which screened the window, but it must have been made of some\r\nunusually thick material, for, within, the room was strangely dark.\r\nSydney entered, with the intention of drawing up the blind, but he had\r\nscarcely taken a couple of steps when he stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Holt, in a voice which was so unlike his own that it\r\nwas scarcely recognisable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It?--What do you mean by it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Beetle!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJudging from the sound of his voice Sydney was all at once in a state\r\nof odd excitement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, is it!--Then, if this time I don\xe2\x80\x99t find out the how and the why\r\nand the wherefore of that charming conjuring trick, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you leave\r\nto write me down an ass,--with a great, big A.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe rushed farther into the room,--apparently his efforts to lighten it\r\ndid not meet with the immediate success which he desired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with this confounded blind? There\xe2\x80\x99s no cord! How do\r\nyou pull it up?--What the--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn the middle of his sentence Sydney ceased speaking. Suddenly Mr Holt,\r\nwho was standing by my side on the threshold of the door, was seized\r\nwith such a fit of trembling, that, fearing he was going to fall, I\r\ncaught him by the arm. A most extraordinary look was on his face. His\r\neyes were distended to their fullest width, as if with horror at what\r\nthey saw in front of them. Great beads of perspiration were on his\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s coming!\xe2\x80\x99 he screamed.\r\n\r\nExactly what happened I do not know. But, as he spoke, I heard,\r\nproceeding from the room, the sound of the buzzing of wings. Instantly\r\nit recalled my experiences of the night before,--as it did so I was\r\nconscious of a most unpleasant qualm. Sydney swore a great oath, as if\r\nhe were beside himself with rage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you won\xe2\x80\x99t go up, you shall come down.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI suppose, failing to find a cord, he seized the blind from below, and\r\ndragged it down,--it came, roller and all, clattering to the floor. The\r\nroom was all in light. I hurried in. Sydney was standing by the window,\r\nwith a look of perplexity upon his face which, under any other\r\ncircumstances, would have been comical. He was holding papa\xe2\x80\x99s revolver\r\nin his hand, and was glaring round and round the room, as if wholly at\r\na loss to understand how it was he did not see what he was looking for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Marjorie!\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x98Did you hear anything?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course I did. It was that which I heard last night,--which so\r\nfrightened me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, was it? Then, by--\xe2\x80\x99 in his excitement he must have been completely\r\noblivious of my presence, for he used the most terrible language, \xe2\x80\x98when\r\nI find it there\xe2\x80\x99ll be a small discussion. It can\xe2\x80\x99t have got out of the\r\nroom,--I know the creature\xe2\x80\x99s here; I not only heard it, I felt it brush\r\nagainst my face.--Holt, come inside and shut that door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Holt raised his arms, as if he were exerting himself to make a\r\nforward movement,--but he remained rooted to the spot on which he stood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t!--Why?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It won\xe2\x80\x99t let me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What won\xe2\x80\x99t let you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Beetle!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSydney moved till he was close in front of him. He surveyed him with\r\neager eyes. I was just at his back. I heard him murmur,--possibly to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By George!--It\xe2\x80\x99s just as I thought!--The beggar\xe2\x80\x99s hypnotised!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he said aloud,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can you see it now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Behind you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Mr Holt spoke, I again heard, quite close to me, that buzzing sound.\r\nSydney seemed to hear it too,--it caused him to swing round so quickly\r\nthat he all but whirled me off my feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, Marjorie, but this is of the nature of an\r\nunparalleled experience,--didn\xe2\x80\x99t you hear something then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did,--distinctly; it was close to me,--within an inch or two of my\r\nface.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe stared about us, then back at each other,--there was nothing else to\r\nbe seen. Sydney laughed, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s uncommonly queer. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to suggest that there are visions\r\nabout, or I might suspect myself of softening of the brain. But--it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nqueer. There\xe2\x80\x99s a trick about it somewhere, I am convinced; and no doubt\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s simple enough when you know how it\xe2\x80\x99s done,--but the difficulty is\r\nto find that out.--Do you think our friend over there is acting?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He looks to me as if he were ill.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He does look ill. He also looks as if he were hypnotised. If he is, it\r\nmust be by suggestion,--and that\xe2\x80\x99s what makes me doubtful, because it\r\nwill be the first plainly established case of hypnotism by suggestion\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve encountered.--Holt!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sydney in my ear, \xe2\x80\x98is the voice and that is the manner of\r\na hypnotised man, but, on the other hand, a person under influence\r\ngenerally responds only to the hypnotist,--which is another feature\r\nabout our peculiar friend which arouses my suspicions.\xe2\x80\x99 Then, aloud,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t stand there like an idiot,--come inside.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain Mr Holt made an apparently futile effort to do as he was bid. It\r\nwas painful to look at him,--he was like a feeble, frightened,\r\ntottering child, who would come on, but cannot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No nonsense, my man! Do you think that this is a performance in a\r\nbooth, and that I am to be taken in by all the humbug of the\r\nprofessional mesmerist? Do as I tell you,--come into the room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a repetition, on Mr Holt\xe2\x80\x99s part, of his previous pitiful\r\nstruggle; this time it was longer sustained than before,--but the\r\nresult was the same.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 he wailed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I say you can,--and shall! If I pick you up, and carry you,\r\nperhaps you will not find yourself so helpless as you wish me to\r\nsuppose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSydney moved forward to put his threat into execution. As he did so, a\r\nstrange alteration took place in Mr Holt\xe2\x80\x99s demeanour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXX.\r\n THE SINGULAR BEHAVIOUR OF MR HOLT\r\n\r\nI was standing in the middle of the room, Sydney was between the door\r\nand me; Mr Holt was in the hall, just outside the doorway, in which he,\r\nso to speak, was framed. As Sydney advanced towards him he was seized\r\nwith a kind of convulsion,--he had to lean against the side of the door\r\nto save himself from falling. Sydney paused, and watched. The spasm\r\nwent as suddenly as it came,--Mr Holt became as motionless as he had\r\njust now been the other way. He stood in an attitude of febrile\r\nexpectancy,--his chin raised, his head thrown back, his eyes glancing\r\nupwards,--with the dreadful fixed glare which had come into them ever\r\nsince we had entered the house. He looked to me as if his every faculty\r\nwas strained in the act of listening,--not a muscle in his body seemed\r\nto move; he was as rigid as a figure carved in stone. Presently the\r\nrigidity gave place to what, to an onlooker, seemed causeless agitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hear!\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed, in the most curious voice I had ever heard. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\ncome!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was as though he was speaking to someone who was far away. Turning,\r\nhe walked down the passage to the front door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Sydney. \xe2\x80\x98Where are you off to?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe both of us hastened to see. He was fumbling with the latch; before\r\nwe could reach him, the door was open, and he was through it. Sydney,\r\nrushing after him, caught him on the step and held him by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the meaning of this little caper?--Where do you think you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ngoing now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Holt did not condescend to turn and look at him. He said, in the\r\nsame dreamy, faraway, unnatural tone of voice,--and he kept his\r\nunwavering gaze fixed on what was apparently some distant object which\r\nwas visible only to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am going to him. He calls me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who calls you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Lord of the Beetle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhether Sydney released his arm or not I cannot say. As he spoke, he\r\nseemed to me to slip away from Sydney\xe2\x80\x99s grasp. Passing through the\r\ngateway, turning to the right, he commenced to retrace his steps in the\r\ndirection we had come. Sydney stared after him in unequivocal\r\namazement. Then he looked at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!--this is a pretty fix!--now what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with him?\xe2\x80\x99 I inquired. \xe2\x80\x98Is he mad?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s method in his madness if he is. He\xe2\x80\x99s in the same condition in\r\nwhich he was that night I saw him come out of the Apostle\xe2\x80\x99s window.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nSydney has a horrible habit of calling Paul \xe2\x80\x98the Apostle\xe2\x80\x99; I have\r\nspoken to him about it over and over again,--but my words have not made\r\nmuch impression. \xe2\x80\x98He ought to be followed,--he may be sailing off to\r\nthat mysterious friend of his this instant.--But, on the other hand, he\r\nmayn\xe2\x80\x99t, and it may be nothing but a trick of our friend the conjurer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nto get us away from this elegant abode of his. He\xe2\x80\x99s done me twice\r\nalready, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be done again,--and I distinctly do not want\r\nhim to return and find me missing. He\xe2\x80\x99s quite capable of taking the\r\nhint, and removing himself into the _Ewigkeit_,--when the clue to as\r\npretty a mystery as ever I came across will have vanished.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can stay,\xe2\x80\x99 I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You?--Alone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe eyed me doubtingly,--evidently not altogether relishing the\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why not? You might send the first person you meet,--policeman, cabman,\r\nor whoever it is--to keep me company. It seems a pity now that we\r\ndismissed that cab.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, it does seem a pity.\xe2\x80\x99 Sydney was biting his lip. \xe2\x80\x98Confound that\r\nfellow! how fast he moves.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Holt was already nearing the end of the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you think it necessary, by all means follow to see where he\r\ngoes,--you are sure to meet somebody whom you will be able to send\r\nbefore you have gone very far.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose I shall.--You won\xe2\x80\x99t mind being left alone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why should I?--I\xe2\x80\x99m not a child.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Holt, reaching the corner, turned it, and vanished out of sight.\r\nSydney gave an exclamation of impatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I don\xe2\x80\x99t make haste I shall lose him. I\xe2\x80\x99ll do as you\r\nsuggest--dispatch the first individual I come across to hold watch and\r\nward with you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe started off at a run,--shouting to me as he went.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It won\xe2\x80\x99t be five minutes before somebody comes!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI waved my hand to him. I watched him till he reached the end of the\r\nroad. Turning, he waved his hand to me. Then he vanished, as Mr Holt\r\nhad done.\r\n\r\nAnd I was alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXI.\r\n THE TERROR BY DAY\r\n\r\nMy first impulse, after Sydney\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance, was to laugh. Why\r\nshould he display anxiety on my behalf merely because I was to be the\r\nsole occupant of an otherwise empty house for a few minutes more or\r\nless,--and in broad daylight too! To say the least, the anxiety seemed\r\nunwarranted.\r\n\r\nI lingered at the gate, for a moment or two, wondering what was at the\r\nbottom of Mr Holt\xe2\x80\x99s singular proceedings, and what Sydney really\r\nproposed to gain by acting as a spy upon his wanderings. Then I turned\r\nto re-enter the house. As I did so, another problem suggested itself to\r\nmy mind,--what connection, of the slightest importance, could a man in\r\nPaul Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s position have with the eccentric being who had\r\nestablished himself in such an unsatisfactory dwelling-place? Mr Holt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstory I had only dimly understood,--it struck me that it would require\r\na deal of understanding. It was more like a farrago of nonsense, an\r\noutcome of delirium, than a plain statement of solid facts. To tell the\r\ntruth, Sydney had taken it more seriously than I expected. He seemed to\r\nsee something in it which I emphatically did not. What was double Dutch\r\nto me, seemed clear as print to him. So far as I could judge, he\r\nactually had the presumption to imagine that Paul--my Paul!--Paul\r\nLessingham!--the great Paul Lessingham!--was mixed up in the very\r\nmysterious adventures of poor, weak-minded, hysterical Mr Holt, in a\r\nmanner which was hardly to his credit.\r\n\r\nOf course, any idea of the kind was purely and simply balderdash.\r\nExactly what bee Sydney had got in his bonnet, I could not guess. But I\r\ndid know Paul. Only let me find myself face to face with the fantastic\r\nauthor of Mr Holt\xe2\x80\x99s weird tribulations, and I, a woman, single-handed,\r\nwould do my best to show him that whoever played pranks with Paul\r\nLessingham trifled with edged tools.\r\n\r\nI had returned to that historical front room which, according to Mr\r\nHolt, had been the scene of his most disastrous burglarious entry.\r\nWhoever had furnished it had had original notions of the resources of\r\nmodern upholstery. There was not a table in the place,--no chair or\r\ncouch, nothing to sit down upon except the bed. On the floor there was\r\na marvellous carpet which was apparently of eastern manufacture. It was\r\nso thick, and so pliant to the tread, that moving over it was like\r\nwalking on thousand-year-old turf. It was woven in gorgeous colours,\r\nand covered with--\r\n\r\nWhen I discovered what it actually was covered with, I was conscious of\r\na disagreeable sense of surprise.\r\n\r\nIt was covered with beetles!\r\n\r\nAll over it, with only a few inches of space between each, were\r\nrepresentations of some peculiar kind of beetle,--it was the same\r\nbeetle, over, and over, and over. The artist had woven his undesirable\r\nsubject into the warp and woof of the material with such cunning skill\r\nthat, as one continued to gaze, one began to wonder if by any\r\npossibility the creatures could be alive.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the softness of the texture, and the art--of a kind!--which\r\nhad been displayed in the workmanship, I rapidly arrived at the\r\nconclusion that it was the most uncomfortable carpet I had ever seen. I\r\nwagged my finger at the repeated portrayals of the--to me!--unspeakable\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I had discovered that you were there before Sydney went, I think it\r\njust possible that I should have hesitated before I let him go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen there came a revulsion of feeling. I shook myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Marjorie Lindon, to even think\r\nsuch nonsense. Are you all nerves and morbid imaginings,--you who have\r\nprided yourself on being so strong-minded! A pretty sort you are to do\r\nbattle for anyone.--Why, they\xe2\x80\x99re only make-believes!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHalf involuntarily, I drew my foot over one of the creatures. Of\r\ncourse, it was nothing but imagination; but I seemed to feel it squelch\r\nbeneath my shoe. It was disgusting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come!\xe2\x80\x99 I cried. \xe2\x80\x98This won\xe2\x80\x99t do! As Sydney would phrase it,--am I going\r\nto make an idiot of myself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI turned to the window,--looking at my watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s more than five minutes ago since Sydney went. That companion of\r\nmine ought to be already on the way. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and see if he is coming.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI went to the gate. There was not a soul in sight. It was with such a\r\ndistinct sense of disappointment that I perceived this was so, that I\r\nwas in two minds what to do. To remain where I was, looking, with\r\ngaping eyes, for the policeman, or the cabman, or whoever it was Sydney\r\nwas dispatching to act as my temporary associate, was tantamount to\r\nacknowledging myself a simpleton,--while I was conscious of a most\r\nunmistakable reluctance to return within the house.\r\n\r\nCommon sense, or what I took for common sense, however, triumphed, and,\r\nafter loitering for another five minutes, I did go in again.\r\n\r\nThis time, ignoring, to the best of my ability, the beetles on the\r\nfloor, I proceeded to expend my curiosity--and occupy my thoughts--in\r\nan examination of the bed. It only needed a very cursory examination,\r\nhowever, to show that the seeming bed was, in reality, none at all,--or\r\nif it was a bed after the manner of the Easterns it certainly was not\r\nafter the fashion of the Britons. There was no framework,--nothing to\r\nrepresent the bedstead. It was simply a heap of rugs piled apparently\r\nindiscriminately upon the floor. A huge mass of them there seemed to\r\nbe; of all sorts, and shapes, and sizes,--and materials too.\r\n\r\nThe top one was of white silk,--in quality, exquisite. It was of huge\r\nsize, yet, with a little compression, one might almost have passed it\r\nthrough the proverbial wedding ring. So far as space admitted I spread\r\nit out in front of me. In the middle was a picture,--whether it was\r\nembroidered on the substance or woven in it, I could not quite make\r\nout. Nor, at first, could I gather what it was the artist had intended\r\nto depict,--there was a brilliancy about it which was rather dazzling.\r\nBy degrees, I realised that the lurid hues were meant for flames,--and,\r\nwhen one had got so far, one perceived that they were by no means badly\r\nimitated either. Then the meaning of the thing dawned on me,--it was a\r\nrepresentation of a human sacrifice. In its way, as ghastly a piece of\r\nrealism as one could see.\r\n\r\nOn the right was the majestic seated figure of a goddess. Her hands\r\nwere crossed upon her knees, and she was naked from her waist upwards.\r\nI fancied it was meant for Isis. On her brow was perched a\r\ngaily-apparelled beetle--that ubiquitous beetle!--forming a bright spot\r\nof colour against her coppery skin,--it was an exact reproduction of\r\nthe creatures which were imaged on the carpet. In front of the idol was\r\nan enormous fiery furnace. In the very heart of the flames was an\r\naltar. On the altar was a naked white woman being burned alive. There\r\ncould be no doubt as to her being alive, for she was secured by chains\r\nin such a fashion that she was permitted a certain amount of freedom,\r\nof which she was availing herself to contort and twist her body into\r\nshapes which were horribly suggestive of the agony which she was\r\nenduring,--the artist, indeed, seemed to have exhausted his powers in\r\nhis efforts to convey a vivid impression of the pains which were\r\ntormenting her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A pretty picture, on my word! A pleasant taste in art the garnitures\r\nof this establishment suggest! The person who likes to live with this\r\nkind of thing, especially as a covering to his bed, must have his own\r\nnotions as to what constitute agreeable surroundings.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs I continued staring at the thing, all at once it seemed as if the\r\nwoman on the altar moved. It was preposterous, but she appeared to\r\ngather her limbs together, and turn half over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What can be the matter with me? Am I going mad? She can\xe2\x80\x99t be moving!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIf she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, then certainly something was,--she was lifted right into\r\nthe air. An idea occurred to me. I snatched the rug aside.\r\n\r\nThe mystery was explained!\r\n\r\nA thin, yellow, wrinkled hand was protruding from amidst the heap of\r\nrugs,--it was its action which had caused the seeming movement of the\r\nfigure on the altar. I stared, confounded. The hand was followed by an\r\narm; the arm by a shoulder; the shoulder by a head,--and the most\r\nawful, hideous, wicked-looking face I had ever pictured even in my most\r\ndreadful dreams. A pair of baleful eyes were glaring up at mine.\r\n\r\nI understood the position in a flash of startled amazement.\r\n\r\nSydney, in following Mr Holt, had started on a wild goose chase after\r\nall. I was alone with the occupant of that mysterious house,--the chief\r\nactor in Mr Holt\xe2\x80\x99s astounding tale. He had been hidden in the heap of\r\nrugs all the while.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n BOOK IV.\r\n In Pursuit\r\n\r\n _The Conclusion of the Matter is extracted from the Case-Book of the\r\n Hon. Augustus Champnell, Confidential Agent_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXII.\r\n A NEW CLIENT\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of Friday, June 2, 18--, I was entering in my\r\ncase-book some memoranda having reference to the very curious matter of\r\nthe Duchess of Datchet\xe2\x80\x99s Deed-box. It was about two o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Andrews\r\ncame in and laid a card upon my desk. On it was inscribed \xe2\x80\x98Mr Paul\r\nLessingham.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Show Mr Lessingham in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAndrews showed him in. I was, of course, familiar with Mr Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nappearance, but it was the first time I had had with him any personal\r\ncommunication. He held out his hand to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are Mr Champnell?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe that I have not had the honour of meeting you before, Mr\r\nChampnell, but with your father, the Earl of Glenlivet, I have the\r\npleasure of some acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI bowed. He looked at me, fixedly, as if he were trying to make out\r\nwhat sort of man I was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are very young, Mr Champnell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been told that an eminent offender in that respect once\r\nasserted that youth is not of necessity a crime.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you have chosen a singular profession,--one in which one hardly\r\nlooks for juvenility.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You yourself, Mr Lessingham, are not old. In a statesman one expects\r\ngrey hairs.--I trust that I am sufficiently ancient to be able to do\r\nyou service.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think it possible. I have heard of you more than once, Mr Champnell,\r\nalways to your advantage. My friend, Sir John Seymour, was telling me,\r\nonly the other day, that you have recently conducted for him some\r\nbusiness, of a very delicate nature, with much skill and tact; and he\r\nwarmly advised me, if ever I found myself in a predicament, to come to\r\nyou. I find myself in a predicament now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain I bowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A predicament, I fancy, of an altogether unparalleled sort. I take it\r\nthat anything I may say to you will be as though it were said to a\r\nfather confessor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may rest assured of that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good.--Then, to make the matter clear to you I must begin by telling\r\nyou a story,--if I may trespass on your patience to that extent. I will\r\nendeavour not to be more verbose than the occasion requires.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI offered him a chair, placing it in such a position that the light\r\nfrom the window would have shone full upon his face. With the calmest\r\npossible air, as if unconscious of my design, he carried the chair to\r\nthe other side of my desk, twisting it right round before he sat on\r\nit,--so that now the light was at his back and on my face. Crossing his\r\nlegs, clasping his hands about his knee, he sat in silence for some\r\nmoments, as if turning something over in his mind. He glanced round the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose, Mr Champnell, that some singular tales have been told in\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Some very singular tales indeed. I am never appalled by singularity.\r\nIt is my normal atmosphere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And yet I should be disposed to wager that you have never listened to\r\nso strange a story as that which I am about to tell you now. So\r\nastonishing, indeed, is the chapter in my life which I am about to open\r\nout to you, that I have more than once had to take myself to task, and\r\nfit the incidents together with mathematical accuracy in order to\r\nassure myself of its perfect truth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe paused. There was about his demeanour that suggestion of reluctance\r\nwhich I not uncommonly discover in individuals who are about to take\r\nthe skeletons from their cupboards and parade them before my eyes. His\r\nnext remark seemed to point to the fact that he perceived what was\r\npassing through my thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My position is not rendered easier by the circumstance that I am not\r\nof a communicative nature. I am not in sympathy with the spirit of the\r\nage which craves for personal advertisement. I hold that the private\r\nlife even of a public man should be held inviolate. I resent, with\r\npeculiar bitterness, the attempts of prying eyes to peer into matters\r\nwhich, as it seems to me, concern myself alone. You must, therefore,\r\nbear with me, Mr Champnell, if I seem awkward in disclosing to you\r\ncertain incidents in my career which I had hoped would continue locked\r\nin the secret depository of my own bosom, at any rate till I was\r\ncarried to the grave. I am sure you will suffer me to stand excused if\r\nI frankly admit that it is only an irresistible chain of incidents\r\nwhich has constrained me to make of you a confidant.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My experience tells me, Mr Lessingham, that no one ever does come to\r\nme until they are compelled. In that respect I am regarded as something\r\nworse even than a medical man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA wintry smile flitted across his features,--it was clear that he\r\nregarded me as a good deal worse than a medical man. Presently he began\r\nto tell me one of the most remarkable tales which even I had heard. As\r\nhe proceeded I understood how strong, and how natural, had been his\r\ndesire for reticence. On the mere score of credibility he must have\r\ngreatly preferred to have kept his own counsel. For my part I own,\r\nunreservedly, that I should have deemed the tale incredible had it been\r\ntold me by Tom, Dick, or Harry, instead of by Paul Lessingham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n WHAT CAME OF LOOKING THROUGH A LATTICE\r\n\r\nHe began in accents which halted not a little. By degrees his voice\r\ngrew firmer. Words came from him with greater fluency.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not yet forty. So when I tell you that twenty years ago I was a\r\nmere youth I am stating what is a sufficiently obvious truth. It is\r\ntwenty years ago since the events of which I am going to speak\r\ntranspired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I lost both my parents when I was quite a lad, and by their death I\r\nwas left in a position in which I was, to an unusual extent in one so\r\nyoung, my own master. I was ever of a rambling turn of mind, and when,\r\nat the mature age of eighteen, I left school, I decided that I should\r\nlearn more from travel than from sojourn at a university. So, since\r\nthere was no one to say me nay, instead of going either to Oxford or\r\nCambridge, I went abroad. After a few months I found myself in\r\nEgypt,--I was down with fever at Shepheard\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel in Cairo. I had\r\ncaught it by drinking polluted water during an excursion with some\r\nBedouins to Palmyra.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When the fever had left me I went out one night into the town in\r\nsearch of amusement. I went, unaccompanied, into the native quarter,\r\nnot a wise thing to do, especially at night, but at eighteen one is not\r\nalways wise, and I was weary of the monotony of the sick-room, and\r\neager for something which had in it a spice of adventure. I found\r\nmyself in a street which I have reason to believe is no longer\r\nexisting. It had a French name, and was called the Rue de Rabagas,--I\r\nsaw the name on the corner as I turned into it, and it has left an\r\nimpress on the tablets of my memory which is never likely to be\r\nobliterated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was a narrow street, and, of course, a dirty one, ill-lit, and,\r\napparently, at the moment of my appearance, deserted. I had gone,\r\nperhaps, half-way down its tortuous length, blundering more than once\r\ninto the kennel, wondering what fantastic whim had brought me into such\r\nunsavoury quarters, and what would happen to me if, as seemed extremely\r\npossible, I lost my way. On a sudden my ears were saluted by sounds\r\nwhich proceeded from a house which I was passing,--sounds of music and\r\nof singing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I paused. I stood awhile to listen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There was an open window on my right, which was screened by latticed\r\nblinds. From the room which was behind these blinds the sounds were\r\ncoming. Someone was singing, accompanied by an instrument resembling a\r\nguitar,--singing uncommonly well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lessingham stopped. A stream of recollection seemed to come flooding\r\nover him. A dreamy look came into his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I remember it all as clearly as if it were yesterday. How it all comes\r\nback,--the dirty street, the evil smells, the imperfect light, the\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s voice filling all at once the air. It was a girl\xe2\x80\x99s voice,--full,\r\nand round, and sweet; an organ seldom met with, especially in such a\r\nplace as that. She sang a little _chansonnette_, which, just then, half\r\nEurope was humming,--it occurred in an opera which they were acting at\r\none of the Boulevard theatres,--\xe2\x80\x9cLa P\xe2\x80\x99tite Voyageuse.\xe2\x80\x9d The effect,\r\ncoming so unexpectedly, was startling. I stood and heard her to an end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Inspired by I know not what impulse of curiosity, when the song was\r\nfinished, I moved one of the lattice blinds a little aside, so as to\r\nenable me to get a glimpse of the singer. I found myself looking into\r\nwhat seemed to be a sort of caf\xc3\xa9,--one of those places which are found\r\nall over the Continent, in which women sing in order to attract custom.\r\nThere was a low platform at one end of the room, and on it were seated\r\nthree women. One of them had evidently just been accompanying her own\r\nsong,--she still had an instrument of music in her hands, and was\r\nstriking a few idle notes. The other two had been acting as audience.\r\nThey were attired in the fantastic apparel which the women who are\r\nfound in such places generally wear. An old woman was sitting knitting\r\nin a corner, whom I took to be the inevitable _patronne_. With the\r\nexception of these four the place was empty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They must have heard me touch the lattice, or seen it moving, for no\r\nsooner did I glance within than the three pairs of eyes on the platform\r\nwere raised and fixed on mine. The old woman in the corner alone showed\r\nno consciousness of my neighbourhood. We eyed one another in silence\r\nfor a second or two. Then the girl with the harp,--the instrument she\r\nwas manipulating proved to be fashioned more like a harp than a\r\nguitar--called out to me,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9c_Entrez, monsieur!--Soyez le bienvenu!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was a little tired. Rather curious as to whereabouts I was,--the\r\nplace struck me, even at that first momentary glimpse, as hardly in the\r\nordinary line of that kind of thing. And not unwilling to listen to a\r\nrepetition of the former song, or to another sung by the same singer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cOn condition,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you sing me another song.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAh, monsieur, with the greatest pleasure in the world I will sing you\r\ntwenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She was almost, if not quite, as good as her word. She entertained me\r\nwith song after song. I may safely say that I have seldom if ever heard\r\nmelody more enchanting. All languages seemed to be the same to her. She\r\nsang in French and Italian, German and English,--in tongues with which\r\nI was unfamiliar. It was in these Eastern harmonies that she was most\r\nsuccessful. They were indescribably weird and thrilling, and she\r\ndelivered them with a verve and sweetness which was amazing. I sat at\r\none of the little tables with which the room was dotted, listening\r\nentranced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Time passed more rapidly than I supposed. While she sang I sipped the\r\nliquor with which the old woman had supplied me. So enthralled was I by\r\nthe display of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s astonishing gifts that I did not notice what\r\nit was I was drinking. Looking back I can only surmise that it was some\r\npoisonous concoction of the creature\xe2\x80\x99s own. That one small glass had on\r\nme the strangest effect. I was still weak from the fever which I had\r\nonly just succeeded in shaking off, and that, no doubt, had something\r\nto do with the result. But, as I continued to sit, I was conscious that\r\nI was sinking into a lethargic condition, against which I was incapable\r\nof struggling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98After a while the original performer ceased her efforts, and, her\r\ncompanions taking her place, she came and joined me at the little\r\ntable. Looking at my watch I was surprised to perceive the lateness of\r\nthe hour. I rose to leave. She caught me by the wrist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cDo not go,\xe2\x80\x9d she said;--she spoke English of a sort, and with the\r\nqueerest accent. \xe2\x80\x9cAll is well with you. Rest awhile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will smile,--I should smile, perhaps, were I the listener instead\r\nof you, but it is the simple truth that her touch had on me what I can\r\nonly describe as a magnetic influence. As her fingers closed upon my\r\nwrist, I felt as powerless in her grasp as if she held me with bands of\r\nsteel. What seemed an invitation was virtually a command. I had to stay\r\nwhether I would or wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. She called for more liquor, and at what\r\nagain was really her command I drank of it. I do not think that after\r\nshe touched my wrist I uttered a word. She did all the talking. And,\r\nwhile she talked, she kept her eyes fixed on my face. Those eyes of\r\nhers! They were a devil\xe2\x80\x99s. I can positively affirm that they had on me\r\na diabolical effect. They robbed me of my consciousness, of my power of\r\nvolition, of my capacity to think,--they made me as wax in her hands.\r\nMy last recollection of that fatal night is of her sitting in front of\r\nme, bending over the table, stroking my wrist with her extended\r\nfingers, staring at me with her awful eyes. After that, a curtain seems\r\nto descend. There comes a period of oblivion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lessingham ceased. His manner was calm and self-contained enough;\r\nbut, in spite of that I could see that the mere recollection of the\r\nthings which he told me moved his nature to its foundations. There was\r\neloquence in the drawn lines about his mouth, and in the strained\r\nexpression of his eyes.\r\n\r\nSo far his tale was sufficiently commonplace. Places such as the one\r\nwhich he described abound in the Cairo of to-day; and many are the\r\nEnglishmen who have entered them to their exceeding bitter cost. With\r\nthat keen intuition which has done him yeoman\xe2\x80\x99s service in the\r\npolitical arena, Mr Lessingham at once perceived the direction my\r\nthoughts were taking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have heard this tale before?--No doubt. And often. The traps are\r\nmany, and the fools and the unwary are not a few. The singularity of my\r\nexperience is still to come. You must forgive me if I seem to stumble\r\nin the telling. I am anxious to present my case as baldly, and with as\r\nlittle appearance of exaggeration as possible. I say with as little\r\nappearance, for some appearance of exaggeration I fear is unavoidable.\r\nMy case is so unique, and so out of the common run of our every-day\r\nexperience, that the plainest possible statement must smack of the\r\nsensational.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As, I fancy, you have guessed, when understanding returned to me, I\r\nfound myself in an apartment with which I was unfamiliar. I was lying,\r\nundressed, on a heap of rugs in a corner of a low-pitched room which\r\nwas furnished in a fashion which, when I grasped the details, filled me\r\nwith amazement. By my side knelt the Woman of the Songs. Leaning over,\r\nshe wooed my mouth with kisses. I cannot describe to you the sense of\r\nhorror and of loathing with which the contact of her lips oppressed me.\r\nThere was about her something so unnatural, so inhuman, that I believe\r\neven then I could have destroyed her with as little sense of moral\r\nturpitude as if she had been some noxious insect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhere am I?\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYou are with the children of Isis,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. What she meant I did\r\nnot know, and do not to this hour. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are in the hands of the great\r\ngoddess,--of the mother of men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHow did I come here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cBy the loving kindness of the great mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not, of course, pretend to give you the exact text of her words,\r\nbut they were to that effect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Half raising myself on the heap of rugs, I gazed about me,--and was\r\nastounded at what I saw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The place in which I was, though the reverse of lofty, was of\r\nconsiderable size,--I could not conceive whereabouts it could be. The\r\nwalls and roof were of bare stone,--as though the whole had been hewed\r\nout of the solid rock. It seemed to be some sort of temple, and was\r\nredolent with the most extraordinary odour. An altar stood about the\r\ncentre, fashioned out of a single block of stone. On it a fire burned\r\nwith a faint blue flame,--the fumes which rose from it were no doubt\r\nchiefly responsible for the prevailing perfumes. Behind it was a huge\r\nbronze figure, more than life size. It was in a sitting posture, and\r\nrepresented a woman. Although it resembled no portrayal of her I have\r\nseen either before or since, I came afterwards to understand that it\r\nwas meant for Isis. On the idol\xe2\x80\x99s brow was poised a beetle. That the\r\ncreature was alive seemed clear, for, as I looked at it, it opened and\r\nshut its wings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If the one on the forehead of the goddess was the only live beetle\r\nwhich the place contained, it was not the only representation. It was\r\nmodelled in the solid stone of the roof, and depicted in flaming\r\ncolours on hangings which here and there were hung against the walls.\r\nWherever the eye turned it rested on a scarab. The effect was\r\nbewildering. It was as though one saw things through the distorted\r\nglamour of a nightmare. I asked myself if I were not still dreaming; if\r\nmy appearance of consciousness were not after all a mere delusion; if I\r\nhad really regained my senses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And, here, Mr Champnell, I wish to point out, and to emphasise the\r\nfact, that I am not prepared to positively affirm what portion of my\r\nadventures in that extraordinary, and horrible place, was actuality,\r\nand what the product of a feverish imagination. Had I been persuaded\r\nthat all I thought I saw, I really did see, I should have opened my\r\nlips long ago, let the consequences to myself have been what they\r\nmight. But there is the crux. The happenings were of such an incredible\r\ncharacter, and my condition was such an abnormal one,--I was never\r\nreally myself from the first moment to the last--that I have hesitated,\r\nand still do hesitate, to assert where, precisely, fiction ended and\r\nfact began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With some misty notion of testing my actual condition I endeavoured to\r\nget off the heap of rugs on which I reclined. As I did so the woman at\r\nmy side laid her hand against my chest, lightly. But, had her gentle\r\npressure been the equivalent of a ton of iron, it could not have been\r\nmore effectual. I collapsed, sank back upon the rugs, and lay there,\r\npanting for breath, wondering if I had crossed the border line which\r\ndivides madness from sanity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cLet me get up!--let me go!\xe2\x80\x9d I gasped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cstay with me yet awhile, O my beloved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And again she kissed me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOnce more Mr Lessingham paused. An involuntary shudder went all over\r\nhim. In spite of the evidently great effort which he was making to\r\nretain his self-control his features were contorted by an anguished\r\nspasm. For some seconds he seemed at a loss to find words to enable him\r\nto continue.\r\n\r\nWhen he did go on, his voice was harsh and strained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am altogether incapable of even hinting to you the nauseous nature\r\nof that woman\xe2\x80\x99s kisses. They filled me with an indescribable repulsion.\r\nI look back at them with a feeling of physical, mental, and moral\r\nhorror, across an interval of twenty years. The most dreadful part of\r\nit was that I was wholly incapable of offering even the faintest\r\nresistance to her caresses. I lay there like a log. She did with me as\r\nshe would, and in dumb agony I endured.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe took his handkerchief from his pocket, and, although the day was\r\ncool, with it he wiped the perspiration from his brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To dwell in detail on what occurred during my involuntary sojourn in\r\nthat fearful place is beyond my power. I cannot even venture to attempt\r\nit. The attempt, were it made, would be futile, and, to me, painful\r\nbeyond measure. I seem to have seen all that happened as in a glass\r\ndarkly,--with about it all an element of unreality. As I have already\r\nremarked, the things which revealed themselves, dimly, to my\r\nperception, seemed too bizarre, too hideous, to be true.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was only afterwards, when I was in a position to compare dates,\r\nthat I was enabled to determine what had been the length of my\r\nimprisonment. It appears that I was in that horrible den more than two\r\nmonths,--two unspeakable months. And the whole time there were comings\r\nand goings, a phantasmagoric array of eerie figures continually passed\r\nto and fro before my hazy eyes. What I judge to have been religious\r\nservices took place; in which the altar, the bronze image, and the\r\nbeetle on its brow, figure largely. Not only were they conducted with a\r\nbewildering confusion of mysterious rites, but, if my memory is in the\r\nleast degree trustworthy, they were orgies of nameless horrors. I seem\r\nto have seen things take place at them at the mere thought of which the\r\nbrain reels and trembles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed it is in connection with the cult of the obscene deity to whom\r\nthese wretched creatures paid their scandalous vows that my most awful\r\nmemories seem to have been associated. It may have been--I hope it was,\r\na mirage born of my half delirious state, but it seemed to me that they\r\noffered human sacrifices.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Lessingham said this, I pricked up my ears. For reasons of my\r\nown, which will immediately transpire, I had been wondering if he would\r\nmake any reference to a human sacrifice. He noted my display of\r\ninterest,--but misapprehended the cause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see you start, I do not wonder. But I repeat that unless I was the\r\nvictim of some extraordinary species of double sight--in which case the\r\nwhole business would resolve itself into the fabric of a dream, and I\r\nshould indeed thank God!--I saw, on more than one occasion, a human\r\nsacrifice offered on that stone altar, presumably to the grim image\r\nwhich looked down on it. And, unless I err, in each case the\r\nsacrificial object was a woman, stripped to the skin, as white as you\r\nor I,--and before they burned her they subjected her to every variety\r\nof outrage of which even the minds of demons could conceive. More than\r\nonce since then I have seemed to hear the shrieks of the victims\r\nringing through the air, mingled with the triumphant cries of her\r\nfrenzied murderers, and the music of their harps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was the cumulative horrors of such a scene which gave me the\r\nstrength, or the courage, or the madness, I know not which it was, to\r\nburst the bonds which bound me, and which, even in the bursting, made\r\nof me, even to this hour, a haunted man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There had been a sacrifice,--unless, as I have repeatedly observed,\r\nthe whole was nothing but a dream. A woman--a young and lovely\r\nEnglishwoman, if I could believe the evidence of my own eyes, had been\r\noutraged, and burnt alive, while I lay there helpless, looking on. The\r\nbusiness was concluded. The ashes of the victim had been consumed by\r\nthe participants. The worshippers had departed. I was left alone with\r\nthe woman of the songs, who apparently acted as the guardian of that\r\nworse than slaughterhouse. She was, as usual after such an orgie,\r\nrather a devil than a human being, drunk with an insensate frenzy,\r\ndelirious with inhuman longings. As she approached to offer to me her\r\nloathed caresses, I was on a sudden conscious of something which I had\r\nnot felt before when in her company. It was as though something had\r\nslipped away from me,--some weight which had oppressed me, some bond by\r\nwhich I had been bound. I was aroused, all at once, to a sense of\r\nfreedom; to a knowledge that the blood which coursed through my veins\r\nwas after all my own, that I was master of my own honour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can only suppose that through all those weeks she had kept me there\r\nin a state of mesmeric stupor. That, taking advantage of the weakness\r\nwhich the fever had left behind, by the exercise of her diabolical\r\narts, she had not allowed me to pass out of a condition of hypnotic\r\ntrance. Now, for some reason, the cord was loosed. Possibly her\r\nabsorption in her religious duties had caused her to forget to tighten\r\nit. Anyhow, as she approached me, she approached a man, and one who,\r\nfor the first time for many a day, was his own man. She herself seemed\r\nwholly unconscious of anything of the kind. As she drew nearer to me,\r\nand nearer, she appeared to be entirely oblivious of the fact that I\r\nwas anything but the fibreless, emasculated creature which, up to that\r\nmoment, she had made of me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But she knew it when she touched me,--when she stooped to press her\r\nlips to mine. At that instant the accumulating rage which had been\r\nsmouldering in my breast through all those leaden torturing hours,\r\nsprang into flame. Leaping off my couch of rugs, I flung my hands about\r\nher throat,--and then she knew I was awake. Then she strove to tighten\r\nthe cord which she had suffered to become unduly loose. Her baleful\r\neyes were fixed on mine. I knew that she was putting out her utmost\r\nforce to trick me of my manhood. But I fought with her like one\r\npossessed, and I conquered--in a fashion. I compressed her throat with\r\nmy two hands as with an iron vice. I knew that I was struggling for\r\nmore than life, that the odds were all against me, that I was staking\r\nmy all upon the casting of a die,--I stuck at nothing which could make\r\nme victor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tighter and tighter my pressure grew,--I did not stay to think if I\r\nwas killing her--till on a sudden--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lessingham stopped. He stared with fixed, glassy eyes, as if the\r\nwhole was being re-enacted in front of him. His voice faltered. I\r\nthought he would break down. But, with an effort, he continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On a sudden, I felt her slipping from between my fingers. Without the\r\nslightest warning, in an instant she had vanished, and where, not a\r\nmoment before, she herself had been, I found myself confronting a\r\nmonstrous beetle,--a huge, writhing creation of some wild nightmare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At first the creature stood as high as I did. But, as I stared at it,\r\nin stupefied amazement,--as you may easily imagine,--the thing dwindled\r\nwhile I gazed. I did not stop to see how far the process of dwindling\r\ncontinued,--a stark raving madman for the nonce, I fled as if all the\r\nfiends in hell were at my heels.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n AFTER TWENTY YEARS\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How I reached the open air I cannot tell you,--I do not know. I have\r\na confused recollection of rushing through vaulted passages, through\r\nendless corridors, of trampling over people who tried to arrest my\r\npassage,--and the rest is blank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When I again came to myself I was lying in the house of an American\r\nmissionary named Clements. I had been found, at early dawn, stark\r\nnaked, in a Cairo street, and picked up for dead. Judging from\r\nappearances I must have wandered for miles, all through the night.\r\nWhence I had come, or whither I was going, none could tell,--I could\r\nnot tell myself. For weeks I hovered between life and death. The\r\nkindness of Mr and Mrs Clements was not to be measured by words. I was\r\nbrought to their house a penniless, helpless, battered stranger, and\r\nthey gave me all they had to offer, without money and without\r\nprice,--with no expectation of an earthly reward. Let no one pretend\r\nthat there is no Christian charity under the sun. The debt I owed that\r\nman and woman I was never able to repay. Before I was properly myself\r\nagain, and in a position to offer some adequate testimony of the\r\ngratitude I felt, Mrs Clements was dead, drowned during an excursion on\r\nthe Nile, and her husband had departed on a missionary expedition into\r\nCentral Africa, from which he never returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Although, in a measure, my physical health returned, for months after\r\nI had left the roof of my hospitable hosts, I was in a state of\r\nsemi-imbecility. I suffered from a species of aphasia. For days\r\ntogether I was speechless, and could remember nothing,--not even my own\r\nname. And, when that stage had passed, and I began to move more freely\r\namong my fellows, for years I was but a wreck of my former self. I was\r\nvisited, at all hours of the day and night, by frightful--I know not\r\nwhether to call them visions, they were real enough to me, but since\r\nthey were visible to no one but myself, perhaps that is the word which\r\nbest describes them. Their presence invariably plunged me into a state\r\nof abject terror, against which I was unable to even make a show of\r\nfighting. To such an extent did they embitter my existence, that I\r\nvoluntarily placed myself under the treatment of an expert in mental\r\npathology. For a considerable period of time I was under his constant\r\nsupervision, but the visitations were as inexplicable to him as they\r\nwere to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By degrees, however, they became rarer and rarer, until at last I\r\nflattered myself that I had once more become as other men. After an\r\ninterval, to make sure, I devoted myself to politics. Thenceforward I\r\nhave lived, as they phrase it, in the public eye. Private life, in any\r\npeculiar sense of the term, I have had none.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lessingham ceased. His tale was not uninteresting, and, to say the\r\nleast of it, was curious. But I still was at a loss to understand what\r\nit had to do with me, or what was the purport of his presence in my\r\nroom. Since he remained silent, as if the matter, so far as he was\r\nconcerned, was at an end, I told him so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I presume, Mr Lessingham, that all this is but a prelude to the play.\r\nAt present I do not see where it is that I come in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStill for some seconds he was silent. When he spoke his voice was grave\r\nand sombre, as if he were burdened by a weight of woe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Unfortunately, as you put it, all this has been but a prelude to the\r\nplay. Were it not so I should not now stand in such pressing want of\r\nthe services of a confidential agent,--that is, of an experienced man\r\nof the world, who has been endowed by nature with phenomenal perceptive\r\nfaculties, and in whose capacity and honour I can place the completest\r\nconfidence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI smiled,--the compliment was a pointed one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope your estimate of me is not too high.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope not,--for my sake, as well as for your own. I have heard great\r\nthings of you. If ever man stood in need of all that human skill and\r\nacumen can do for him, I certainly am he.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis words aroused my curiosity. I was conscious of feeling more\r\ninterested than heretofore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will do my best for you. Man can do no more. Only give my best a\r\ntrial.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will. At once.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked at me long and earnestly. Then, leaning forward, he said,\r\nlowering his voice perhaps unconsciously,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The fact is, Mr Champnell, that quite recently events have happened\r\nwhich threaten to bridge the chasm of twenty years, and to place me\r\nface to face with that plague spot of the past. At this moment I stand\r\nin imminent peril of becoming again the wretched thing I was when I\r\nfled from that den of all the devils. It is to guard me against this\r\nthat I have come to you. I want you to unravel the tangled thread which\r\nthreatens to drag me to my doom,--and, when unravelled to sunder\r\nit--for ever, if God wills!--in twain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Explain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo be frank, for the moment I thought him mad. He went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Three weeks ago, when I returned late one night from a sitting in the\r\nHouse of Commons, I found, on my study table, a sheet of paper on which\r\nthere was a representation--marvellously like!--of the creature into\r\nwhich, as it seemed to me, the woman of the songs was transformed as I\r\nclutched her throat between my hands. The mere sight of it brought back\r\none of those visitations of which I have told you, and which I thought\r\nI had done with for ever,--I was convulsed by an agony of fear, thrown\r\ninto a state approximating to a paralysis both of mind and body.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But why?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot tell you. I only know that I have never dared to allow my\r\nthoughts to recur to that last dread scene, lest the mere recurrence\r\nshould drive me mad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What was this you found upon your study table,--merely a drawing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was a representation, produced by what process I cannot say, which\r\nwas so wonderfully, so diabolically, like the original, that for a\r\nmoment I thought the thing itself was on my table.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who put it there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is precisely what I wish you to find out,--what I wish you to\r\nmake it your instant business to ascertain. I have found the thing,\r\nunder similar circumstances, on three separate occasions, on my study\r\ntable,--and each time it has had on me the same hideous effect.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Each time after you have returned from a late sitting in the House of\r\nCommons?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Exactly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where are these--what shall I call them--delineations?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That, again, I cannot tell you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What I say. Each time, when I recovered, the thing had vanished.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sheet of paper and all?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Apparently,--though on that point I could not be positive. You will\r\nunderstand that my study table is apt to be littered with sheets of\r\npaper, and I could not absolutely determine that the thing had not\r\nstared at me from one of those. The delineation itself, to use your\r\nword, certainly had vanished.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI began to suspect that this was a case rather for a doctor than for a\r\nman of my profession. And hinted as much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it is possible, Mr Lessingham, that you have been\r\noverworking yourself--that you have been driving your brain too hard,\r\nand that you have been the victim of an optical delusion?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought so myself; I may say that I almost hoped so. But wait till I\r\nhave finished. You will find that there is no loophole in that\r\ndirection.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe appeared to be recalling events in their due order. His manner was\r\nstudiously cold,--as if he were endeavouring, despite the strangeness\r\nof his story, to impress me with the literal accuracy of each syllable\r\nhe uttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The night before last, on returning home, I found in my study a\r\nstranger.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A stranger?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.--In other words, a burglar.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A burglar?--I see.--Go on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had paused. His demeanour was becoming odder and odder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On my entry he was engaged in forcing an entry into my bureau. I need\r\nhardly say that I advanced to seize him. But--I could not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You could not?--How do you mean you could not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean simply what I say. You must understand that this was no\r\nordinary felon. Of what nationality he was I cannot tell you. He only\r\nuttered two words, and they were certainly in English, but apart from\r\nthat he was dumb. He wore no covering on his head or feet. Indeed, his\r\nonly garment was a long dark flowing cloak which, as it fluttered about\r\nhim, revealed that his limbs were bare.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An unique costume for a burglar.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The instant I saw him I realised that he was in some way connected\r\nwith that adventure in the Rue de Rabagas. What he said and did, proved\r\nit to the hilt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did he say and do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As I approached to effect his capture, he pronounced aloud two words\r\nwhich recalled that awful scene the recollection of which always\r\nlingers in my brain, and of which I never dare to permit myself to\r\nthink. Their very utterance threw me into a sort of convulsion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What were the words?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lessingham opened his mouth,--and shut it. A marked change took\r\nplace in the expression of his countenance. His eyes became fixed and\r\nstaring,--resembling the glassy orbs of the somnambulist. For a moment\r\nI feared that he was going to give me an object lesson in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98visitations\xe2\x80\x99 of which I had heard so much. I rose, with a view of\r\noffering him assistance. He motioned me back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you.--It will pass away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis voice was dry and husky,--unlike his usual silvern tones. After an\r\nuncomfortable interval he managed to continue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You see for yourself, Mr Champnell, what a miserable weakling, when\r\nthis subject is broached, I still remain. I cannot utter the words the\r\nstranger uttered, I cannot even write them down. For some inscrutable\r\nreason they have on me an effect similar to that which spells and\r\nincantations had on people in tales of witchcraft.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose, Mr Lessingham, that there is no doubt that this mysterious\r\nstranger was not himself an optical delusion?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Scarcely. There is the evidence of my servants to prove the contrary.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did your servants see him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Some of them,--yes. Then there is the evidence of the bureau. The\r\nfellow had smashed the top right in two. When I came to examine the\r\ncontents I learned that a packet of letters was missing. They were\r\nletters which I had received from Miss Lindon, a lady whom I hope to\r\nmake my wife. This, also, I state to you in confidence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What use would he be likely to make of them?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If matters stand as I fear they do, he might make a very serious\r\nmisuse of them. If the object of these wretches, after all these years,\r\nis a wild revenge, they would be capable, having discovered what she is\r\nto me, of working Miss Lindon a fatal mischief,--or, at the very least,\r\nof poisoning her mind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see.--How did the thief escape,--did he, like the delineation,\r\nvanish into air?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He escaped by the much more prosaic method of dashing through the\r\ndrawing-room window, and clambering down from the verandah into the\r\nstreet, where he ran right into someone\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Into whose arms,--a constable\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; into Mr Atherton\xe2\x80\x99s,--Sydney Atherton\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The inventor?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The same.--Do you know him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do. Sydney Atherton and I are friends of a good many years\xe2\x80\x99\r\nstanding.--But Atherton must have seen where he came from;--and,\r\nanyhow, if he was in the state of undress which you have described, why\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t he stop him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Atherton\xe2\x80\x99s reasons were his own. He did not stop him, and, so far\r\nas I can learn, he did not attempt to stop him. Instead, he knocked at\r\nmy hall door to inform me that he had seen a man climb out of my\r\nwindow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I happen to know that, at certain seasons, Atherton is a queer\r\nfish,--but that sounds very queer indeed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The truth is, Mr Champnell, that, if it were not for Mr Atherton, I\r\ndoubt if I should have troubled you even now. The accident of his being\r\nan acquaintance of yours makes my task easier.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe drew his chair closer to me with an air of briskness which had been\r\nforeign to him before. For some reason, which I was unable to fathom,\r\nthe introduction of Atherton\xe2\x80\x99s name seemed to have enlivened him.\r\nHowever, I was not long to remain in darkness. In half a dozen\r\nsentences he threw more light on the real cause of his visit to me than\r\nhe had done in all that had gone before. His bearing, too, was more\r\nbusinesslike and to the point. For the first time I had some\r\nglimmerings of the politician,--alert, keen, eager,--as he is known to\r\nall the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Atherton, like myself, has been a postulant for Miss Lindon\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\nBecause I have succeeded where he has failed, he has chosen to be\r\nangry. It seems that he has had dealings, either with my visitor of\r\nTuesday night, or with some other his acquaintance, and he proposes to\r\nuse what he has gleaned from him to the disadvantage of my character. I\r\nhave just come from Mr Atherton. From hints he dropped I conclude that,\r\nprobably during the last few hours, he has had an interview with\r\nsomeone who was connected in some way with that lurid patch in my\r\ncareer; that this person made so-called revelations, which were nothing\r\nbut a series of monstrous lies; and these so-called revelations Mr\r\nAtherton has threatened, in so many words, to place before Miss Lindon.\r\nThat is an eventuality which I wish to avoid. My own conviction is that\r\nthere is at this moment in London an emissary from that den in the\r\nwhilom Rue de Rabagas--for all I know it may be the Woman of the Songs\r\nherself. Whether the sole purport of this individual\xe2\x80\x99s presence is to\r\ndo me injury, I am, as yet, in no position to say, but that it is\r\nproposed to work me mischief, at any rate, by the way, is plain. I\r\nbelieve that Mr Atherton knows more about this person\xe2\x80\x99s individuality\r\nand whereabouts than he has been willing, so far, to admit. I want you,\r\ntherefore, to ascertain these things on my behalf; to find out what,\r\nand where, this person is, to drag her!--or him;--out into the light of\r\nday. In short, I want you to effectually protect me from the terrorism\r\nwhich threatens once more to overwhelm my mental and my physical\r\npowers,--which bids fair to destroy my intellect, my career, my life,\r\nmy all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What reason have you for suspecting that Mr Atherton has seen this\r\nindividual of whom you speak,--has he told you so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Practically,--yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know Atherton well. In his not infrequent moments of excitement he\r\nis apt to use strong language, but it goes no further. I believe him to\r\nbe the last person in the world to do anyone an intentional injustice,\r\nunder any circumstances whatever. If I go to him, armed with\r\ncredentials from you, when he understands the real gravity of the\r\nsituation,--which it will be my business to make him do, I believe\r\nthat, spontaneously, of his own accord, he will tell me as much about\r\nthis mysterious individual as he knows himself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then go to him at once.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good. I will. The result I will communicate to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI rose from my seat. As I did so, someone rushed into the outer office\r\nwith a din and a clatter. Andrews\xe2\x80\x99 voice, and another, became\r\ndistinctly audible,--Andrews\xe2\x80\x99 apparently raised in vigorous\r\nexpostulation. Raised, seemingly, in vain, for presently the door of my\r\nown particular sanctum was thrown open with a crash, and Mr Sydney\r\nAtherton himself came dashing in,--evidently conspicuously under the\r\ninfluence of one of those not infrequent \xe2\x80\x98moments of excitement\xe2\x80\x99 of\r\nwhich I had just been speaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXV.\r\n A BRINGER OF TIDINGS\r\n\r\nAtherton did not wait to see who might or might not be present, but,\r\nwithout even pausing to take breath, he broke into full cry on the\r\ninstant,--as is occasionally his wont.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Champnell!--Thank goodness I\xe2\x80\x99ve found you in!--I want you!--At\r\nonce!--Don\xe2\x80\x99t stop to talk, but stick your hat on, and put your best\r\nfoot forward,--I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you all about it in the cab.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI endeavoured to call his attention to Mr Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s presence,--but\r\nwithout success.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear fellow--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen I had got as far as that he cut me short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cdear fellow\xe2\x80\x9d me!--None of your jabber! And none of your excuses\r\neither! I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got an engagement with the Queen, you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave to chuck it. Where\xe2\x80\x99s that dashed hat of yours,--or are you going\r\nwithout it? Don\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you that every second cut to waste may mean\r\nthe difference between life and death?--Do you want me to drag you down\r\nto the cab by the hair of your head?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will try not to constrain you to quite so drastic a resource,--and I\r\nwas coming to you at once in any case. I only want to call your\r\nattention to the fact that I am not alone.--Here is Mr Lessingham.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn his harum-scarum haste Mr Lessingham had gone unnoticed. Now that\r\nhis observation was particularly directed to him, Atherton started,\r\nturned, and glared at my latest client in a fashion which was scarcely\r\nflattering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!--It\xe2\x80\x99s you, is it?--What the deuce are you doing here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBefore Lessingham could reply to this most unceremonious query,\r\nAtherton, rushing forward, gripped him by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you seen her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLessingham, not unnaturally nonplussed by the other\xe2\x80\x99s curious conduct,\r\nstared at him in unmistakable amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have I seen whom?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Marjorie Lindon!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Marjorie Lindon?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLessingham paused. He was evidently asking himself what the inquiry\r\nmeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have not seen Miss Lindon since last night. Why do you ask?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then Heaven help us!--As I\xe2\x80\x99m a living man I believe he, she, or it has\r\ngot her!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis words were incomprehensible enough to stand in copious need of\r\nexplanation,--as Mr Lessingham plainly thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it that you mean, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What I say,--I believe that that Oriental friend of yours has got her\r\nin her clutches,--if it is a \xe2\x80\x9cher;\xe2\x80\x9d goodness alone knows what the\r\ninfernal conjurer\xe2\x80\x99s real sex may be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Atherton!--Explain yourself!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn a sudden Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s tones rang out like a trumpet call.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If damage comes to her I shall be fit to cut my throat,--and yours!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s next proceeding surprised me,--I imagine it surprised\r\nAtherton still more. Springing at Sydney like a tiger, he caught him by\r\nthe throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You----you hound! Of what wretched folly have you been guilty? If\r\nso much as a hair of her head is injured you shall repay it me ten\r\nthousandfold!--You mischief-making, intermeddling, jealous fool!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe shook Sydney as if he had been a rat,--then flung him from him\r\nheadlong on to the floor. It reminded me of nothing so much as\r\nOthello\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of Iago. Never had I seen a man so transformed by\r\nrage. Lessingham seemed to have positively increased in stature. As he\r\nstood glowering down at the prostrate Sydney, he might have stood for a\r\nmaterialistic conception of human retribution.\r\n\r\nSydney, I take it, was rather surprised than hurt. For a moment or two\r\nhe lay quite still. Then, lifting his head, he looked up his assailant.\r\nThen, raising himself to his feet, he shook himself,--as if with a view\r\nof learning if all his bones were whole. Putting his hands up to his\r\nneck, he rubbed it, gently. And he grinned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By God, Lessingham, there\xe2\x80\x99s more in you than I thought. After all, you\r\nare a man. There\xe2\x80\x99s some holding power in those wrists of\r\nyours,--they\xe2\x80\x99ve nearly broken my neck. When this business is finished,\r\nI should like to put on the gloves with you, and fight it out. You\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nclean wasted upon politics.--Damn it, man, give me your hand!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lessingham did not give him his hand. Atherton took it,--and gave it\r\na hearty shake with both of his.\r\n\r\nIf the first paroxysm of his passion had passed, Lessingham was still\r\nsufficiently stern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Be so good as not to trifle, Mr Atherton. If what you say is correct,\r\nand the wretch to whom you allude really has Miss Lindon at her mercy,\r\nthen the woman I love--and whom you also pretend to love!--stands in\r\nimminent peril not only of a ghastly death, but of what is infinitely\r\nworse than death.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The deuce she does!\xe2\x80\x99 Atherton wheeled round towards me. \xe2\x80\x98Champnell,\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t you got that dashed hat of yours yet? Don\xe2\x80\x99t stand there like a\r\ntailor\xe2\x80\x99s dummy, keeping me on tenter-hooks,--move yourself! I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nyou all about it in the cab.--And, Lessingham, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll come with us\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n WHAT THE TIDINGS WERE\r\n\r\nThree in a hansom cab is not, under all circumstances, the most\r\ncomfortable method of conveyance,--when one of the trio happens to be\r\nSydney Atherton in one of his \xe2\x80\x98moments of excitement\xe2\x80\x99 it is distinctly\r\nthe opposite; as, on that occasion, Mr Lessingham and I both quickly\r\nfound. Sometimes he sat on my knees, sometimes on Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\nfrequently, when he unexpectedly stood up, and all but precipitated\r\nhimself on to the horse\xe2\x80\x99s back, on nobody\xe2\x80\x99s. In the eagerness of his\r\ngesticulations, first he knocked off my hat, then he knocked off\r\nLessingham\xe2\x80\x99s, then his own, then all three together,--once, his own hat\r\nrolling into the mud, he sprang into the road, without previously going\r\nthrough the empty form of advising the driver of his intention, to pick\r\nit up. When he turned to speak to Lessingham, he thrust his elbow into\r\nmy eye; and when he turned to speak to me, he thrust it into\r\nLessingham\xe2\x80\x99s. Never, for one solitary instant, was he at rest, or\r\neither of us at ease. The wonder is that the gymnastics in which he\r\nincessantly indulged did not sufficiently attract public notice to\r\ninduce a policeman to put at least a momentary period to our progress.\r\nHad speed not been of primary importance I should have insisted on the\r\ntransference of the expedition to the somewhat wider limits of a\r\nfour-wheeler.\r\n\r\nHis elucidation of the causes of his agitation was apparently more\r\ncomprehensible to Lessingham than it was to me. I had to piece this and\r\nthat together under considerable difficulties. By degrees I did arrive\r\nat something like a clear notion of what had actually taken place.\r\n\r\nHe commenced by addressing Lessingham,--and thrusting his elbow into my\r\neye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did Marjorie tell you about the fellow she found in the street?\xe2\x80\x99 Up\r\nwent his arm to force the trap-door open overhead,--and off went my\r\nhat. \xe2\x80\x98Now then, William Henry!--let her go!--if you kill the horse I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbuy you another!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe were already going much faster than, legally, we ought to have\r\ndone,--but that, seemingly to him was not a matter of the slightest\r\nconsequence. Lessingham replied to his inquiry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She did not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know the fellow I saw coming out of your drawing-room window?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Marjorie found him the morning after in front of her\r\nbreakfast-room window--in the middle of the street. Seems he had been\r\nwandering about all night, unclothed,--in the rain and the mud, and all\r\nthe rest of it,--in a condition of hypnotic trance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is the----gentleman you are alluding to?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Says his name\xe2\x80\x99s Holt, Robert Holt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Holt?--Is he an Englishman?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very much so,--City quilldriver out of a shop,--stony broke\r\nabsolutely! Got the chuck from the casual ward,--wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let him\r\nin,--house full, and that sort of thing,--poor devil! Pretty passes you\r\npoliticians bring men to!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you sure?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of what?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you sure that this man, Robert Holt, is the same person whom, as\r\nyou put it, you saw coming out of my drawing-room window?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sure!--Of course I\xe2\x80\x99m sure!--Think I didn\xe2\x80\x99t recognise him?--Besides,\r\nthere was the man\xe2\x80\x99s own tale,--owned to it himself,--besides all the\r\nrest, which sent one rushing Fulham way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must remember, Mr Atherton, that I am wholly in the dark as to\r\nwhat has happened. What has the man, Holt, to do with the errand on\r\nwhich we are bound?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Am I not coming to it? If you would let me tell the tale in my own way\r\nI should get there in less than no time, but you will keep on cutting\r\nin,--how the deuce do you suppose Champnell is to make head or tail of\r\nthe business if you will persist in interrupting?--Marjorie took the\r\nbeggar in,--he told his tale to her,--she sent for me--that was just\r\nnow; caught me on the steps after I had been lunching with Dora\r\nGrayling. Holt re-dished his yarn--I smelt a rat--saw that a connection\r\npossibly existed between the thief who\xe2\x80\x99d been playing confounded\r\nconjuring tricks off on to me and this interesting party down Fulham\r\nway--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What party down Fulham way?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This friend of Holt\xe2\x80\x99s--am I not telling you? There you are, you\r\nsee,--won\xe2\x80\x99t let me finish! When Holt slipped through the window--which\r\nis the most sensible thing he seems to have done; if I\xe2\x80\x99d been in his\r\nshoes I\xe2\x80\x99d have slipped through forty windows!--dusky coloured charmer\r\ncaught him on the hop,--doctored him--sent him out to commit burglary\r\nby deputy. I said to Holt, \xe2\x80\x9cShow us this agreeable little crib, young\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d Holt was game--then Marjorie chipped in--she wanted to go and see\r\nit too. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be sorry if you do,\xe2\x80\x9d--that settled it! After\r\nthat she\xe2\x80\x99d have gone if she\xe2\x80\x99d died,--I never did have a persuasive way\r\nwith women. So off we toddled, Marjorie, Holt, and I, in a\r\ngrowler,--spotted the crib in less than no time,--invited ourselves in\r\nby the kitchen window--house seemed empty. Presently Holt became\r\nhypnotised before my eyes,--the best established case of hypnotism by\r\nsuggestion I ever yet encountered--started off on a pilgrimage of one.\r\nLike an idiot I followed, leaving Marjorie to wait for me--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Alone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Alone!--Am I not telling you?--Great Scott, Lessingham, in the House\r\nof Commons they must be hazy to think you smart! I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll send the\r\nfirst sane soul I meet to keep you company.\xe2\x80\x9d As luck would have it, I\r\nnever met one,--only kids, and a baker, who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave his cart, or\r\ntake it with him either. I\xe2\x80\x99d covered pretty nearly two miles before I\r\ncame across a peeler,--and when I did the man was cracked--and he\r\nthought me mad, or drunk, or both. By the time I\xe2\x80\x99d got myself within\r\nnodding distance of being run in for obstructing the police in the\r\nexecution of their duty, without inducing him to move a single one of\r\nhis twenty-four-inch feet, Holt was out of sight. So, since all my\r\npains in his direction were clean thrown away, there was nothing left\r\nfor me but to scurry back to Marjorie,--so I scurried, and I found the\r\nhouse empty, no one there, and Marjorie gone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite follow--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAtherton impetuously declined to allow Mr Lessingham to conclude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course you don\xe2\x80\x99t quite follow, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll follow still less if you\r\nwill keep getting in front. I went upstairs and downstairs, inside and\r\nout--shouted myself hoarse as a crow--nothing was to be seen of\r\nMarjorie,--or heard; until, as I was coming down the stairs for about\r\nthe five-and-fiftieth time, I stepped on something hard which was lying\r\nin the passage. I picked it up,--it was a ring; this ring. Its shape is\r\nnot just what it was,--I\xe2\x80\x99m not as light as gossamer, especially when I\r\ncome jumping downstairs six at a time,--but what\xe2\x80\x99s left of it is here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSydney held something in front of him. Mr Lessingham wriggled to one\r\nside to enable him to see. Then he made a snatch at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s mine!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSydney dodged it out of his reach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s yours?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s the ring I gave Marjorie for an engagement ring. Give it me, you\r\nhound!--unless you wish me to do you violence in the cab.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith complete disregard of the limitations of space,--or of my\r\ncomfort,--Lessingham thrust him vigorously aside. Then gripping Sydney\r\nby the wrist, he seized the gaud,--Sydney yielding it just in time to\r\nsave himself from being precipitated into the street. Ravished of his\r\ntreasure, Sydney turned and surveyed the ravisher with something like a\r\nglance of admiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hang me, Lessingham, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe there is some warm blood in\r\nthose fishlike veins of yours. Please the piper, I\xe2\x80\x99ll live to fight you\r\nafter all,--with the bare ones, sir, as a gentleman should do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLessingham seemed to pay no attention to him whatever. He was surveying\r\nthe ring, which Sydney had trampled out of shape, with looks of the\r\ndeepest concern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Marjorie\xe2\x80\x99s ring!--The one I gave her! Something serious must have\r\nhappened to her before she would have dropped my ring, and left it\r\nlying where it fell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAtherton went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s it!--What has happened to her!--I\xe2\x80\x99ll be dashed if I know!--When\r\nit was clear that there she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, I tore off to find out where she\r\nwas. Came across old Lindon,--he knew nothing;--I rather fancy I\r\nstartled him in the middle of Pall Mall, when I left he stared after me\r\nlike one possessed, and his hat was lying in the gutter. Went\r\nhome,--she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there. Asked Dora Grayling,--she\xe2\x80\x99d seen nothing of\r\nher. No one had seen anything of her,--she had vanished into air. Then\r\nI said to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a first-class idiot, on my honour! While\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re looking for her, like a lost sheep, the betting is that the\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s in Holt\xe2\x80\x99s friend\xe2\x80\x99s house the whole jolly time. When you were\r\nthere, the chances are that she\xe2\x80\x99d just stepped out for a stroll, and\r\nthat now she\xe2\x80\x99s back again, and wondering where on earth you\xe2\x80\x99ve gone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSo I made up my mind that I\xe2\x80\x99d fly back and see,--because the idea of\r\nher standing on the front doorstep looking for me, while I was going\r\noff my nut looking for her, commended itself to what I call my sense of\r\nhumour; and on my way it struck me that it would be the part of wisdom\r\nto pick up Champnell, because if there is a man who can be backed to\r\nfind a needle in any amount of haystacks it is the great\r\nAugustus.--That horse has moved itself after all, because here we are.\r\nNow, cabman, don\xe2\x80\x99t go driving further on,--you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to put a girdle\r\nround the earth if you do; because you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to reach this point\r\nagain before you get your fare.--This is the magician\xe2\x80\x99s house!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n WHAT WAS HIDDEN UNDER THE FLOOR\r\n\r\nThe cab pulled up in front of a tumbledown cheap \xe2\x80\x98villa\xe2\x80\x99 in an\r\nunfinished cheap neighbourhood,--the whole place a living monument of\r\nthe defeat of the speculative builder.\r\n\r\nAtherton leaped out on to the grass-grown rubble which was meant for a\r\nfootpath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t see Marjorie looking for me on the doorstep.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNor did I,--I saw nothing but what appeared to be an unoccupied\r\nramshackle brick abomination. Suddenly Sydney gave an exclamation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hullo!--The front door\xe2\x80\x99s closed!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI was hard at his heels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, when I went I left the front door open. It looks as if I\xe2\x80\x99ve made\r\nan idiot of myself after all, and Marjorie\xe2\x80\x99s returned,--let\xe2\x80\x99s hope to\r\ngoodness that I have.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe knocked. While we waited for a response I questioned him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why did you leave the door open when you went?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hardly know,--I imagine that it was with some dim idea of Marjorie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeing able to get in if she returned while I was absent,--but the truth\r\nis I was in such a condition of helter skelter that I am not prepared\r\nto swear that I had any reasonable reason.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose there is no doubt that you did leave it open?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Absolutely none,--on that I\xe2\x80\x99ll stake my life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was it open when you returned from your pursuit of Holt?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wide open,--I walked straight in expecting to find her waiting for me\r\nin the front room,--I was struck all of a heap when I found she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Were there any signs of a struggle?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98None,--there were no signs of anything. Everything was just as I had\r\nleft it, with the exception of the ring which I trod on in the passage,\r\nand which Lessingham has.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If Miss Lindon has returned, it does not look as if she were in the\r\nhouse at present.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt did not,--unless silence had such meaning. Atherton had knocked\r\nloudly three times without succeeding in attracting the slightest\r\nnotice from within.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It strikes me that this is another case of seeking admission through\r\nthat hospitable window at the back.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAtherton led the way to the rear. Lessingham and I followed. There was\r\nnot even an apology for a yard, still less a garden,--there was not\r\neven a fence of any sort, to serve as an enclosure, and to shut off the\r\nhouse from the wilderness of waste land. The kitchen window was open. I\r\nasked Sydney if he had left it so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,--I dare say we did; I don\xe2\x80\x99t fancy that either of us\r\nstood on the order of his coming.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhile he spoke, he scrambled over the sill. We followed. When he was\r\nin, he shouted at the top of his voice,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Marjorie! Marjorie! Speak to me, Marjorie,--it is I,--Sydney!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe words echoed through the house. Only silence answered. He led the\r\nway to the front room. Suddenly he stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried. \xe2\x80\x98The blind\xe2\x80\x99s down!\xe2\x80\x99 I had noticed, when we were\r\noutside, that the blind was down at the front room window. \xe2\x80\x98It was up\r\nwhen I went, that I\xe2\x80\x99ll swear. That someone has been here is pretty\r\nplain,--let\xe2\x80\x99s hope it\xe2\x80\x99s Marjorie.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had only taken a step forward into the room when he again stopped\r\nshort to exclaim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My stars!--here\xe2\x80\x99s a sudden clearance!--Why, the place is\r\nempty,--everything\xe2\x80\x99s clean gone!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean?--was it furnished when you left?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe room was empty enough then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Furnished?--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that it was exactly what you\xe2\x80\x99d call\r\nfurnished,--the party who ran this establishment had a taste in\r\nupholstery which was all his own,--but there was a carpet, and a bed,\r\nand--and lots of things,--for the most part, I should have said,\r\ndistinctly Eastern curiosities. They seem to have evaporated into\r\nsmoke,--which may be a way which is common enough among Eastern\r\ncuriosities, though it\xe2\x80\x99s queer to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAtherton was staring about him as if he found it difficult to credit\r\nthe evidence of his own eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How long ago is it since you left?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe referred to his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Something over an hour,--possibly an hour and a half; I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t swear\r\nto the exact moment, but it certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you notice any signs of packing up?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a sign.\xe2\x80\x99 Going to the window he drew up the blind,--speaking as he\r\ndid so. \xe2\x80\x98The queer thing about this business is that when we first got\r\nin this blind wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t draw up a little bit, so, since it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\nup I pulled it down, roller and all, now it draws up as easily and\r\nsmoothly as if it had always been the best blind that ever lived.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStanding at Sydney\xe2\x80\x99s back I saw that the cabman on his box was\r\nsignalling to us with his outstretched hand. Sydney perceived him too.\r\nHe threw up the sash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Excuse me, sir, but who\xe2\x80\x99s the old gent?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What old gent?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why the old gent peeping through the window of the room upstairs?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe words were hardly out of the driver\xe2\x80\x99s mouth when Sydney was through\r\nthe door and flying up the staircase. I followed rather more\r\nsoberly,--his methods were a little too flighty for me. When I reached\r\nthe landing, dashing out of the front room he rushed into the one at\r\nthe back,--then through a door at the side. He came out shouting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the idiot mean!--with his old gent! I\xe2\x80\x99d old gent him if I got\r\nhim!--There\xe2\x80\x99s not a creature about the place!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe returned into the front room,--I at his heels. That certainly was\r\nempty,--and not only empty, but it showed no traces of recent\r\noccupation. The dust lay thick upon the floor,--there was that mouldy,\r\nearthy smell which is so frequently found in apartments which have been\r\nlong untenanted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you sure, Atherton, that there is no one at the back?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,--you can go and see for yourself if you like; do\r\nyou think I\xe2\x80\x99m blind? Jehu\xe2\x80\x99s drunk.\xe2\x80\x99 Throwing up the sash he addressed\r\nthe driver. \xe2\x80\x98What do you mean with your old gent at the window?--what\r\nwindow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That window, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Go to!--you\xe2\x80\x99re dreaming, man!--there\xe2\x80\x99s no one here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Begging your pardon, sir, but there was someone there not a minute\r\nago.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Imagination, cabman,--the slant of the light on the glass,--or your\r\neyesight\xe2\x80\x99s defective.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Excuse me, sir, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not my imagination, and my eyesight\xe2\x80\x99s as good\r\nas any man\xe2\x80\x99s in England,--and as for the slant of the light on the\r\nglass, there ain\xe2\x80\x99t much glass for the light to slant on. I saw him\r\npeeping through that bottom broken pane on your left hand as plainly as\r\nI see you. He must be somewhere about,--he can\xe2\x80\x99t have got away,--he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nat the back. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t there a cupboard nor nothing where he could hide?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe cabman\xe2\x80\x99s manner was so extremely earnest that I went myself to see.\r\nThere was a cupboard on the landing, but the door of that stood wide\r\nopen, and that obviously was bare. The room behind was small, and,\r\ndespite the splintered glass in the window frame, stuffy. Fragments of\r\nglass kept company with the dust on the floor, together with a choice\r\ncollection of stones, brickbats, and other missiles,--which not\r\nimprobably were the cause of their being there. In the corner stood a\r\ncupboard,--but a momentary examination showed that that was as bare as\r\nthe other. The door at the side, which Sydney had left wide open,\r\nopened on to a closet, and that was empty. I glanced up,--there was no\r\ntrap door which led to the roof. No practicable nook or cranny, in\r\nwhich a living being could lie concealed, was anywhere at hand.\r\n\r\nI returned to Sydney\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder to tell the cabman so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is no place in which anyone could hide, and there is no one in\r\neither of the rooms,--you must have been mistaken, driver.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe man waxed wroth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me! How could I come to think I saw something when I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One\xe2\x80\x99s eyes are apt to play us tricks;--how could you see what wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthere?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s what I want to know. As I drove up, before you told me to stop,\r\nI saw him looking through the window,--the one at which you are. He\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ngot his nose glued to the broken pane, and was staring as hard as he\r\ncould stare. When I pulled up, off he started,--I saw him get up off\r\nhis knees, and go to the back of the room. When the gentleman took to\r\nknocking, back he came,--to the same old spot, and flopped down on his\r\nknees. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what caper you was up to,--you might be bum\r\nbailiffs for all I knew!--and I supposed that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so anxious to\r\nlet you in as you might be to get inside, and that was why he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake no notice of your knocking, while all the while he kept a eye on\r\nwhat was going on. When you goes round to the back, up he gets again,\r\nand I reckoned that he was going to meet yer, and perhaps give yer a\r\nbit of his mind, and that presently I should hear a shindy, or that\r\nsomething would happen. But when you pulls up the blind downstairs, to\r\nmy surprise back he come once more. He shoves his old nose right\r\nthrough the smash in the pane, and wags his old head at me like a\r\nchattering magpie. That didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to me quite the civil thing to\r\ndo,--I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done no harm to him; so I gives you the office, and lets\r\nyou know that he was there. But for you to say that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there,\r\nand never had been,--blimey! that cops the biscuit. If he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there,\r\nall I can say is I ain\xe2\x80\x99t here, and my \xe2\x80\x99orse ain\xe2\x80\x99t here, and my cab\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t neither,--damn it!--the house ain\xe2\x80\x99t here, and nothing ain\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe settled himself on his perch with an air of the most extreme ill\r\nusage,--he had been standing up to tell his tale. That the man was\r\nserious was unmistakable. As he himself suggested, what inducement\r\ncould he have had to tell a lie like that? That he believed himself to\r\nhave seen what he declared he saw was plain. But, on the other hand,\r\nwhat could have become--in the space of fifty seconds!--of his \xe2\x80\x98old\r\ngent\xe2\x80\x99?\r\n\r\nAtherton put a question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did he look like,--this old gent of yours?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, that I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly like to say. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much of his face\r\nI could see, only his face and his eyes,--and they wasn\xe2\x80\x99t pretty. He\r\nkept a thing over his head all the time, as if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want too much\r\nto be seen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What sort of a thing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why,--one of them cloak sort of things, like them Arab blokes used to\r\nwear what used to be at Earl\xe2\x80\x99s Court Exhibition,--you know!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis piece of information seemed to interest my companions more than\r\nanything he had said before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A burnoose do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How am I to know what the thing\xe2\x80\x99s called? I ain\xe2\x80\x99t up in foreign\r\nlanguages,--\xe2\x80\x99tain\xe2\x80\x99t likely! All I know that them Arab blokes what was\r\nat Earl\xe2\x80\x99s Court used to walk about in them all over the\r\nplace,--sometimes they wore them over their heads, and sometimes they\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t. In fact if you\xe2\x80\x99d asked me, instead of trying to make out as I\r\nsees double, or things what was only inside my own noddle, or something\r\nor other, I should have said this here old gent what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been telling\r\nyou about was a Arab bloke,--when he gets off his knees to sneak away\r\nfrom the window, I could see that he had his cloak thing, what was over\r\nhis head, wrapped all round him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lessingham turned to me, all quivering with excitement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe that what he says is true!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then where can this mysterious old gentleman have got to,--can you\r\nsuggest an explanation? It is strange, to say the least of it, that the\r\ncabman should be the only person to see or hear anything of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Some devil\xe2\x80\x99s trick has been played,--I know it, I feel it!--my\r\ninstinct tells me so!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI stared. In such a matter one hardly expects a man of Paul\r\nLessingham\xe2\x80\x99s stamp to talk of \xe2\x80\x98instinct.\xe2\x80\x99 Atherton stared too. Then, on\r\na sudden, he burst out,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By the Lord, I believe the Apostle\xe2\x80\x99s right,--the whole place reeks to\r\nme of hankey-pankey,--it did as soon as I put my nose inside. In\r\nmatters of prestidigitation, Champnell, we Westerns are among the\r\nrudiments,--we\xe2\x80\x99ve everything to learn,--Orientals leave us at the post.\r\nIf their civilisation\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased to call extinct, their\r\nconjuring--when you get to know it!--is all alive oh!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe moved towards the door. As he went he slipped, or seemed to, all but\r\nstumbling on to his knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Something tripped me up,--what\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x99 He was stamping on the floor\r\nwith his foot. \xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s a board loose. Come and lend me a hand, one of\r\nyou fellows, to get it up. Who knows what mystery\xe2\x80\x99s beneath?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI went to his aid. As he said, a board in the floor was loose. His\r\nstepping on it unawares had caused his stumble. Together we prised it\r\nout of its place,--Lessingham standing by and watching us the while.\r\nHaving removed it, we peered into the cavity it disclosed.\r\n\r\nThere was something there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Atherton, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s a woman\xe2\x80\x99s clothing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n [IMAGE: images/img_279.jpg\r\n CAPTION: THEY STARED AT ME IN SILENCE AS I DRAGGED THESE OUT AND LAID\r\n THEM ON THE FLOOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n THE REST OF THE FIND\r\n\r\nIt was a woman\xe2\x80\x99s clothing, beyond a doubt, all thrown in anyhow,--as if\r\nthe person who had placed it there had been in a desperate hurry. An\r\nentire outfit was there, shoes, stockings, body linen, corsets, and\r\nall,--even to hat, gloves, and hairpins;--these latter were mixed up\r\nwith the rest of the garments in strange confusion. It seemed plain\r\nthat whoever had worn those clothes had been stripped to the skin.\r\n\r\nLessingham and Sydney stared at me in silence as I dragged them out and\r\nlaid them on the floor. The dress was at the bottom,--it was an alpaca,\r\nof a pretty shade in blue, bedecked with lace and ribbons, as is the\r\nfashion of the hour, and lined with sea-green silk. It had perhaps been\r\na \xe2\x80\x98charming confection\xe2\x80\x99 once--and that a very recent one!--but now it\r\nwas all soiled and creased and torn and tumbled. The two spectators\r\nmade a simultaneous pounce at it as I brought it to the light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My God!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Sydney, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s Marjorie\xe2\x80\x99s!--she was wearing it when I\r\nsaw her last!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s Marjorie\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x99 gasped Lessingham,--he was clutching at the ruined\r\ncostume, staring at it like a man who has just received sentence of\r\ndeath. \xe2\x80\x98She wore it when she was with me yesterday,--I told her how it\r\nsuited her, and how pretty it was!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was silence,--it was an eloquent find; it spoke for itself. The\r\ntwo men gazed at the heap of feminine glories,--it might have been the\r\nmost wonderful sight they ever had seen. Lessingham was the first to\r\nspeak,--his face had all at once grown grey and haggard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What has happened to her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI replied to his question with another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you sure this is Miss Lindon\xe2\x80\x99s dress?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure,--and were proof needed, here it is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had found the pocket, and was turning out the contents. There was a\r\npurse, which contained money and some visiting cards on which were her\r\nname and address; a small bunch of keys, with her nameplate attached; a\r\nhandkerchief, with her initials in a corner. The question of ownership\r\nwas placed beyond a doubt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You see,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lessingham, exhibiting the money which was in the\r\npurse, \xe2\x80\x98it is not robbery which has been attempted. Here are two\r\nten-pound notes, and one for five, besides gold and silver,--over\r\nthirty pounds in all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAtherton, who had been turning over the accumulation of rubbish between\r\nthe joists, proclaimed another find.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here are her rings, and watch, and a bracelet,--no, it certainly does\r\nnot look as if theft had been an object.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLessingham was glowering at him with knitted brows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have to thank you for this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSydney was unwontedly meek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are hard on me, Lessingham, harder than I deserve,--I had rather\r\nhave thrown away my own life than have suffered misadventure to have\r\ncome to her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yours are idle words. Had you not meddled this would not have\r\nhappened. A fool works more mischief with his folly than of malice\r\nprepense. If hurt has befallen Marjorie Lindon you shall account for it\r\nto me with your life\xe2\x80\x99s blood.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let it be so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sydney. \xe2\x80\x98I am content. If hurt has come to\r\nMarjorie, God knows that I am willing enough that death should come to\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhile they wrangled, I continued to search. A little to one side, under\r\nthe flooring which was still intact, I saw something gleam. By\r\nstretching out my hand, I could just manage to reach it,--it was a long\r\nplait of woman\xe2\x80\x99s hair. It had been cut off at the roots,--so close to\r\nthe head in one place that the scalp itself had been cut, so that the\r\nhair was clotted with blood.\r\n\r\nThey were so occupied with each other that they took no notice of me. I\r\nhad to call their attention to my discovery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen, I fear that I have here something which will distress\r\nyou,--is not this Miss Lindon\xe2\x80\x99s hair?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey recognised it on the instant. Lessingham, snatching it from my\r\nhands, pressed it to his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is mine,--I shall at least have something.\xe2\x80\x99 He spoke with a\r\ngrimness which was a little startling. He held the silken tresses at\r\narm\xe2\x80\x99s length. \xe2\x80\x98This points to murder,--foul, cruel, causeless murder.\r\nAs I live, I will devote my all,--money, time, reputation!--to gaining\r\nvengeance on the wretch who did this deed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAtherton chimed in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To that I say, Amen!\xe2\x80\x99 He lifted his hand. \xe2\x80\x98God is my witness!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It seems to me, gentlemen, that we move too fast,--to my mind it does\r\nnot by any means of necessity point to murder. On the contrary, I doubt\r\nif murder has been done. Indeed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind owning that I have a\r\ntheory of my own which points all the other way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLessingham caught me by the sleeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Champnell, tell me your theory.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will, a little later. Of course it may be altogether wrong;--though\r\nI fancy it is not; I will explain my reasons when we come to talk of\r\nit. But, at present, there are things which must be done.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I vote for tearing up every board in the house!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Sydney. \xe2\x80\x98And\r\nfor pulling the whole infernal place to pieces. It\xe2\x80\x99s a conjurer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nden.--I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if cabby\xe2\x80\x99s old gent is staring at us all\r\nthe while from some peephole of his own.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe examined the entire house, methodically, so far as we were able,\r\ninch by inch. Not another board proved loose,--to lift those which were\r\nnailed down required tools, and those we were without. We sounded all\r\nthe walls,--with the exception of the party walls they were the usual\r\nlath and plaster constructions, and showed no signs of having been\r\ntampered with. The ceilings were intact; if anything was concealed in\r\nthem it must have been there some time,--the cement was old and dirty.\r\nWe took the closet to pieces; examined the chimneys; peered into the\r\nkitchen oven and the copper;--in short, we pried into everything which,\r\nwith the limited means at our disposal, could be pried into,--without\r\nresult. At the end we found ourselves dusty, dirty, and discomfited.\r\nThe cabman\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98old gent\xe2\x80\x99 remained as much a mystery as ever, and no\r\nfurther trace had been discovered of Miss Lindon.\r\n\r\nAtherton made no effort to disguise his chagrin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done? There seems to be just nothing in the place at\r\nall, and yet that there is, and that it\xe2\x80\x99s the key to the whole\r\nconfounded business I should be disposed to swear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In that case I would suggest that you should stay and look for it. The\r\ncabman can go and look for the requisite tools, or a workman to assist\r\nyou, if you like. For my part it appears to me that evidence of another\r\nsort is, for the moment, of paramount importance; and I propose to\r\ncommence my search for it by making a call at the house which is over\r\nthe way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI had observed, on our arrival, that the road only contained two houses\r\nwhich were in anything like a finished state,--that which we were in,\r\nand another, some fifty or sixty yards further down, on the opposite\r\nside. It was to this I referred. The twain immediately proffered their\r\ncompanionship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will come with you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Lessingham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I,\xe2\x80\x99 echoed Sydney. \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll leave this sweet homestead in charge of\r\nthe cabman,--I\xe2\x80\x99ll pull it to pieces afterwards.\xe2\x80\x99 He went out and spoke\r\nto the driver. \xe2\x80\x98Cabby, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to pay a visit to the little crib\r\nover there,--you keep an eye on this one. And if you see a sign of\r\nanyone being about the place,--living, or dead, or anyhow--you give me\r\na yell. I shall be on the lookout, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be with you before you can\r\nsay Jack Robinson.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You bet I\xe2\x80\x99ll yell,--I\xe2\x80\x99ll raise the hair right off you.\xe2\x80\x99 The fellow\r\ngrinned. \xe2\x80\x98But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you gents are hiring me by the day,--I\r\nwant to change my horse; he ought to have been in his stable a couple\r\nof hours ago.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind your horse,--let him rest a couple of hours extra to-morrow\r\nto make up for those he has lost to-day. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care you don\xe2\x80\x99t lose\r\nanything by this little job,--or your horse either.--By the way, look\r\nhere,--this will be better than yelling.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTaking a revolver out of his trousers\xe2\x80\x99 pocket he handed it up to the\r\ngrinning driver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If that old gent of yours does appear, you have a pop at him,--I shall\r\nhear that easier than a yell. You can put a bullet through him if you\r\nlike,--I give you my word it won\xe2\x80\x99t be murder.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if it is,\xe2\x80\x99 declared the cabman, handling the weapon like\r\none who was familiar with arms of precision. \xe2\x80\x98I used to fancy my\r\nrevolver shooting when I was with the colours, and if I do get a chance\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll put a shot through the old hunks, if only to prove to you that I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nno liar.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhether the man was in earnest or not I could not tell,--nor whether\r\nAtherton meant what he said in answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you shoot him I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you fifty pounds.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right!\xe2\x80\x99 The driver laughed. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll do my best to earn that fifty!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n MISS LOUISA COLEMAN\r\n\r\nThat the house over the way was tenanted was plain to all the\r\nworld,--at least one occupant sat gazing through the window of the\r\nfirst floor front room. An old woman in a cap,--one of those large\r\nold-fashioned caps which our grandmothers used to wear, tied with\r\nstrings under the chin. It was a bow window, and as she was seated in\r\nthe bay looking right in our direction she could hardly have failed to\r\nsee us as we advanced,--indeed she continued to stare at us all the\r\nwhile with placid calmness. Yet I knocked once, twice, and yet again\r\nwithout the slightest notice being taken of my summons.\r\n\r\nSydney gave expression to his impatience in his own peculiar vein.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Knockers in this part of the world seem intended for ornament\r\nonly,--nobody seems to pay any attention to them when they\xe2\x80\x99re used. The\r\nold lady upstairs must be either deaf or dotty.\xe2\x80\x99 He went out into the\r\nroad to see if she still was there. \xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s looking at me as calmly as\r\nyou please,--what does she think we\xe2\x80\x99re doing here, I wonder; playing a\r\ntune on her front door by way of a little amusement?--Madam!\xe2\x80\x99 He took\r\noff his hat and waved it to her. \xe2\x80\x98Madam! might I observe that if you\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t condescend to notice that we\xe2\x80\x99re here your front door will run the\r\nrisk of being severely injured!--She don\xe2\x80\x99t care for me any more than if\r\nI was nothing at all,--sound another tattoo upon that knocker. Perhaps\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s so deaf that nothing short of a cataclysmal uproar will reach her\r\nauditory nerves.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe immediately proved, however, that she was nothing of the sort.\r\nHardly had the sounds of my further knocking died away than, throwing\r\nup the window, she thrust out her head and addressed me in a fashion\r\nwhich, under the circumstances, was as unexpected as it was uncalled\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, young man, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t be in such a hurry!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSydney explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me, madam, it\xe2\x80\x99s not so much a hurry we\xe2\x80\x99re in as pressed for\r\ntime,--this is a matter of life and death.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe turned her attention to Sydney,--speaking with a frankness for\r\nwhich, I imagine, he was unprepared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want none of your imperence, young man. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you\r\nbefore,--you\xe2\x80\x99ve been hanging about here the whole day long!--and I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like the looks of you, and so I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know. That\xe2\x80\x99s my front\r\ndoor, and that\xe2\x80\x99s my knocker,--I\xe2\x80\x99ll come down and open when I like, but\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be hurried, and if the knocker\xe2\x80\x99s so much as touched\r\nagain, I won\xe2\x80\x99t come down at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe closed the window with a bang. Sydney seemed divided between mirth\r\nand indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a nice old lady, on my honour,--one of the good old crusty\r\nsort. Agreeable characters this neighbourhood seems to grow,--a sojourn\r\nhereabouts should do one good. Unfortunately I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel disposed just\r\nnow to stand and kick my heels in the road.\xe2\x80\x99 Again saluting the old\r\ndame by raising his hat he shouted to her at the top of his voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Madam, I beg ten thousand pardons for troubling you, but this is a\r\nmatter in which every second is of vital importance,--would you allow\r\nme to ask you one or two questions?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUp went the window; out came the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, young man, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t put yourself out to holler at me,--I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe hollered at! I\xe2\x80\x99ll come down and open that door in five minutes by\r\nthe clock on my mantelpiece, and not a moment before.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe fiat delivered, down came the window. Sydney looked rueful,--he\r\nconsulted his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you think, Champnell, but I really doubt if this\r\ncomfortable creature can tell us anything worth waiting another five\r\nminutes to hear. We mustn\xe2\x80\x99t let the grass grow under our feet, and time\r\nis getting on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI was of a different opinion,--and said so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, Atherton, that I can\xe2\x80\x99t agree with you. She seems to have\r\nnoticed you hanging about all day; and it is at least possible that she\r\nhas noticed a good deal which would be well worth our hearing. What\r\nmore promising witness are we likely to find?--her house is the only\r\none which overlooks the one we have just quitted. I am of opinion that\r\nit may not only prove well worth our while to wait five minutes, but\r\nalso that it would be as well, if possible, not to offend her by the\r\nway. She\xe2\x80\x99s not likely to afford us the information we require if you\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good. If that\xe2\x80\x99s what you think I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to wait,--only\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s to be hoped that that clock upon her mantelpiece moves quicker\r\nthan its mistress.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPresently, when about a minute had gone, he called to the cabman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Seen a sign of anything?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe cabman shouted back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ne\xe2\x80\x99er a sign,--you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear a sound of popguns when I do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThose five minutes did seem long ones. But at last Sydney, from his\r\npost of vantage in the road, informed us that the old lady was moving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s getting up;--she\xe2\x80\x99s leaving the window;--let\xe2\x80\x99s hope to goodness\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s coming down to open the door. That\xe2\x80\x99s been the longest five\r\nminutes I\xe2\x80\x99ve known.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI could hear uncertain footsteps descending the stairs. They came along\r\nthe passage. The door was opened--\xe2\x80\x98on the chain.\xe2\x80\x99 The old lady peered\r\nat us through an aperture of about six inches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you young men think you\xe2\x80\x99re after, but have all three\r\nof you in my house I won\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have him and you\xe2\x80\x99--a skinny finger was\r\npointed to Lessingham and me; then it was directed towards\r\nAtherton--\xe2\x80\x98but have him I won\xe2\x80\x99t. So if it\xe2\x80\x99s anything particular you\r\nwant to say to me, you\xe2\x80\x99ll just tell him to go away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn hearing this Sydney\xe2\x80\x99s humility was abject. His hat was in his\r\nhand,--he bent himself double.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Suffer me to make you a million apologies, madam, if I have in any way\r\noffended you; nothing, I assure you, could have been farther from my\r\nintention, or from my thoughts.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want none of your apologies, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want none of you\r\nneither; I don\xe2\x80\x99t like the looks of you, and so I tell you. Before I let\r\nanybody into my house you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to sling your hook.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe door was banged in our faces. I turned to Sydney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The sooner you go the better it will be for us. You can wait for us\r\nover the way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders, and groaned,--half in jest, half in earnest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I must I suppose I must,--it\xe2\x80\x99s the first time I\xe2\x80\x99ve been refused\r\nadmittance to a lady\xe2\x80\x99s house in all my life! What have I done to\r\ndeserve this thing?--If you keep me waiting long I\xe2\x80\x99ll tear that\r\ninfernal den to pieces!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe sauntered across the road, viciously kicking the stones as he went.\r\nThe door reopened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has that other young man gone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then now I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you in. Have him inside my house I won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe chain was removed. Lessingham and I entered. Then the door was\r\nrefastened and the chain replaced. Our hostess showed us into the front\r\nroom on the ground floor; it was sparsely furnished and not too\r\nclean,--but there were chairs enough for us to sit upon; which she\r\ninsisted on our occupying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sit down, do,--I can\xe2\x80\x99t abide to see folks standing; it gives me the\r\nfidgets.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo soon as we were seated, without any overture on our parts she\r\nplunged _in medias res_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know what it is you\xe2\x80\x99ve come about,--I know! You want me to tell you\r\nwho it is as lives in the house over the road. Well, I can tell\r\nyou,--and I dare bet a shilling that I\xe2\x80\x99m about the only one who can.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI inclined my head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed. Is that so, madam?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was huffed at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t madam me,--I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear none of your lip service. I\xe2\x80\x99m a\r\nplain-spoken woman, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I am, and I like other people\xe2\x80\x99s tongues\r\nto be as plain as mine. My name\xe2\x80\x99s Miss Louisa Coleman; but I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngenerally called Miss Coleman,--I\xe2\x80\x99m only called Louisa by my relatives.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSince she was apparently between seventy and eighty--and looked every\r\nyear of her apparent age--I deemed that possible. Miss Coleman was\r\nevidently a character. If one was desirous of getting information out\r\nof her it would be necessary to allow her to impart it in her own\r\nmanner,--to endeavour to induce her to impart it in anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwould be time clean wasted. We had Sydney\xe2\x80\x99s fate before our eyes.\r\n\r\nShe started with a sort of roundabout preamble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This property is mine; it was left me by my uncle, the late George\r\nHenry Jobson,--he\xe2\x80\x99s buried in Hammersmith Cemetery just over the\r\nway,--he left me the whole of it. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the finest building sites\r\nnear London, and it increases in value every year, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to\r\nlet it for another twenty, by which time the value will have more than\r\ntrebled,--so if that is what you\xe2\x80\x99ve come about, as heaps of people do,\r\nyou might have saved yourselves the trouble. I keep the boards\r\nstanding, just to let people know that the ground is to let,--though,\r\nas I say, it won\xe2\x80\x99t be for another twenty years, when it\xe2\x80\x99ll be for the\r\nerection of high-class mansions only, same as there is in Grosvenor\r\nSquare,--no shops or public houses, and none of your shanties. I live\r\nin this place just to keep an eye upon the property,--and as for the\r\nhouse over the way, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never tried to let it, and it never has been\r\nlet, not until a month ago, when, one morning, I had this letter. You\r\ncan see it if you like.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe handed me a greasy envelope which she ferreted out of a capacious\r\npocket which was suspended from her waist, and which she had to lift up\r\nher skirt to reach. The envelope was addressed, in unformed characters,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Louisa Coleman, The Rhododendrons, Convolvulus Avenue, High Oaks\r\nPark, West Kensington.\xe2\x80\x99--I felt, if the writer had not been of a\r\nhumorous turn of mind, and drawn on his imagination, and this really\r\nwas the lady\xe2\x80\x99s correct address, then there must be something in a name.\r\n\r\nThe letter within was written in the same straggling, characterless\r\ncaligraphy,--I should have said, had I been asked offhand, that the\r\nwhole thing was the composition of a servant girl. The composition was\r\nabout on a par with the writing.\r\n\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98The undersigned would be oblidged if Miss Coleman would let her empty\r\n house. I do not know the rent but send fifty pounds. If more will send.\r\n Please address, Mohamed el Kheir, Post Office, Sligo Street, London.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nIt struck me as being as singular an application for a tenancy as I\r\nremembered to have encountered. When I passed it on to Lessingham, he\r\nseemed to think so too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is a curious letter, Miss Coleman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I thought,--and still more so when I found the fifty pounds inside.\r\nThere were five ten-pound notes, all loose, and the letter not even\r\nregistered. If I had been asked what was the rent of the house, I\r\nshould have said, at the most, not more than twenty pounds,--because,\r\nbetween you and me, it wants a good bit of doing up, and is hardly fit\r\nto live in as it stands.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI had had sufficient evidence of the truth of this altogether apart\r\nfrom the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s frank admission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, for all he could have done to help himself I might have kept the\r\nmoney, and only sent him a receipt for a quarter. And some folks would\r\nhave done,--but I\xe2\x80\x99m not one of that sort myself, and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care to\r\nbe. So I sent this here party,--I never could pronounce his name, and\r\nnever shall--a receipt for a year.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Coleman paused to smooth her apron, and consider.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, the receipt should have reached this here party on the Thursday\r\nmorning, as it were,--I posted it on the Wednesday night, and on the\r\nThursday, after breakfast, I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d go over the way to see if\r\nthere was any little thing I could do,--because there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly a\r\nwhole pane of glass in the place,--when I all but went all of a heap.\r\nWhen I looked across the road, blessed if the party wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in\r\nalready,--at least as much as he ever was in, which, so far as I can\r\nmake out, never has been anything particular,--though how he had got\r\nin, unless it was through a window in the middle of the night, is more\r\nthan I should care to say,--there was nobody in the house when I went\r\nto bed, that I could pretty nearly take my Bible oath,--yet there was\r\nthe blind up at the parlour, and, what\xe2\x80\x99s more, it was down, and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen down pretty nearly ever since.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I says to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cfor right down imperence this beats\r\nanything,--why he\xe2\x80\x99s in the place before he knows if I\xe2\x80\x99ll let him have\r\nit. Perhaps he thinks I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a word to say in the matter,--fifty\r\npounds or no fifty pounds, I\xe2\x80\x99ll soon show him.\xe2\x80\x9d So I slips on my\r\nbonnet, and I walks over the road, and I hammers at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I have seen people hammering since then, many a one, and how\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve kept it up has puzzled me,--for an hour, some of them,--but I\r\nwas the first one as begun it. I hammers, and I hammers, and I kept on\r\nhammering, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t no more use than if I\xe2\x80\x99d been hammering at a\r\ntombstone. So I starts rapping at the window, but that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t no use\r\nneither. So I goes round behind, and I hammers at the back door,--but\r\nthere, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make anyone hear nohow. So I says to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps\r\nthe party as is in, ain\xe2\x80\x99t in, in a manner of speaking; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep an\r\neye on the house, and when he is in I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care that he ain\xe2\x80\x99t out\r\nagain before I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a word to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I come back home, and as I said I would, I kept an eye on the house\r\nthe whole of that livelong day, but never a soul went either out or in.\r\nBut the next day, which it was a Friday, I got out of bed about five\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, to see if it was raining, through my having an idea of taking\r\na little excursion if the weather was fine, when I see a party coming\r\ndown the road. He had on one of them dirty-coloured bed-cover sort of\r\nthings, and it was wrapped all over his head and round his body, like,\r\nas I have been told, them there Arabs wear,--and, indeed, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen\r\nthem in them myself at West Brompton, when they was in the exhibition\r\nthere. It was quite fine, and broad day, and I see him as plainly as I\r\nsee you,--he comes skimming along at a tear of a pace, pulls up at the\r\nhouse over the way, opens the front door, and lets himself in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cSo,\xe2\x80\x9d I says to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cthere you are. Well, Mr Arab, or whatever, or\r\nwhoever, you may be, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take good care that you don\xe2\x80\x99t go out again\r\nbefore you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a word from me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you that landladies have\r\ntheir rights, like other Christians, in this country, however it may be\r\nin yours.\xe2\x80\x9d So I kept an eye on the house, to see that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t go out\r\nagain, and nobody never didn\xe2\x80\x99t, and between seven and eight I goes and\r\nI knocks at the door,--because I thought to myself that the earlier I\r\nwas the better it might be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you\xe2\x80\x99ll believe me, no more notice was taken of me than if I was one\r\nof the dead. I hammers, and I hammers, till my wrist was aching, I\r\ndaresay I hammered twenty times,--and then I went round to the back\r\ndoor, and I hammers at that,--but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the least good in the\r\nworld. I was that provoked to think I should be treated as if I was\r\nnothing and nobody, by a dirty foreigner, who went about in a bed-gown\r\nthrough the public streets, that it was all I could do to hold myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I comes round to the front again, and I starts hammering at the\r\nwindow, with every knuckle on my hands, and I calls out, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Miss\r\nLouisa Coleman, and I\xe2\x80\x99m the owner of this house, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t deceive\r\nme,--I saw you come in, and you\xe2\x80\x99re in now, and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t come and\r\nspeak to me this moment I\xe2\x80\x99ll have the police.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All of a sudden, when I was least expecting it, and was hammering my\r\nvery hardest at the pane, up goes the blind, and up goes the window\r\ntoo, and the most awful-looking creature ever I heard of, not to\r\nmention seeing, puts his head right into my face,--he was more like a\r\nhideous baboon than anything else, let alone a man. I was struck all of\r\na heap, and plumps down on the little wall, and all but tumbles head\r\nover heels backwards. And he starts shrieking, in a sort of a kind of\r\nEnglish, and in such a voice as I\xe2\x80\x99d never heard the like,--it was like\r\na rusty steam engine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cGo away! go away! I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you! I will not have you,--never! You\r\nhave your fifty pounds,--you have your money,--that is the whole of\r\nyou,--that is all you want! You come to me no more!--never!--never no\r\nmore!--or you be sorry!--Go away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did go away, and that as fast as ever my legs would carry me,--what\r\nwith his looks, and what with his voice, and what with the way that he\r\nwent on, I was nothing but a mass of trembling. As for answering him\r\nback, or giving him a piece of my mind, as I had meant to, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave done it not for a thousand pounds. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind confessing,\r\nbetween you and me, that I had to swallow four cups of tea, right\r\nstraight away, before my nerves was steady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I says to myself, when I did feel, as it might be, a little\r\nmore easy, \xe2\x80\x9cyou never have let that house before, and now you\xe2\x80\x99ve let it\r\nwith a vengeance,--so you have. If that there new tenant of yours isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthe greatest villain that ever went unhung it must be because he\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\nnear relations what\xe2\x80\x99s as bad as himself,--because two families like his\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sure there can\xe2\x80\x99t be. A nice sort of Arab party to have sleeping\r\nover the road he is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But after a time I cools down, as it were,--because I\xe2\x80\x99m one of them\r\nsort as likes to see on both sides of a question. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all,\xe2\x80\x9d I says\r\nto myself, \xe2\x80\x9che has paid his rent, and fifty pounds is fifty pounds,--I\r\ndoubt if the whole house is worth much more, and he can\xe2\x80\x99t do much\r\ndamage to it whatever he does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have minded, so far as that went, if he\xe2\x80\x99d set fire to the\r\nplace, for, between ourselves, it\xe2\x80\x99s insured for a good bit over its\r\nvalue. So I decided that I\xe2\x80\x99d let things be as they were, and see how\r\nthey went on. But from that hour to this I\xe2\x80\x99ve never spoken to the man,\r\nand never wanted to, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, not of my own free will, not for a\r\nshilling a time,--that face of his will haunt me if I live till Noah,\r\nas the saying is. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him going in and out at all hours of the\r\nday and night,--that Arab party\xe2\x80\x99s a mystery if ever there was one,--he\r\nalways goes tearing along as if he\xe2\x80\x99s flying for his life. Lots of\r\npeople have come to the house, all sorts and kinds, men and\r\nwomen--they\xe2\x80\x99ve been mostly women, and even little children. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen\r\nthem hammer and hammer at that front door, but never a one have I seen\r\nlet in,--or yet seen taken any notice of, and I think I may say, and\r\nyet tell no lie, that I\xe2\x80\x99ve scarcely took my eye off the house since\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s been inside it, over and over again in the middle of the night\r\nhave I got up to have a look, so that I\xe2\x80\x99ve not missed much that has\r\ntook place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s puzzled me is the noises that\xe2\x80\x99s come from the house. Sometimes\r\nfor days together there\xe2\x80\x99s not been a sound, it might have been a house\r\nof the dead; and then, all through the night, there\xe2\x80\x99ve been yells and\r\nscreeches, squawks and screams,--I never heard nothing like it. I have\r\nthought, and more than once, that the devil himself must be in that\r\nfront room, let alone all the rest of his demons. And as for\r\ncats!--where they\xe2\x80\x99ve come from I can\xe2\x80\x99t think. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t use to notice\r\nhardly a cat in the neighbourhood till that there Arab party\r\ncame,--there isn\xe2\x80\x99t much to attract them; but since he came there\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nregiments. Sometimes at night there\xe2\x80\x99s been troops about the place,\r\nscreeching like mad,--I\xe2\x80\x99ve wished them farther, I can tell you. That\r\nArab party must be fond of \xe2\x80\x99em. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen them inside the house, at the\r\nwindows, upstairs and downstairs, as it seemed to me, a dozen at a time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XL.\r\n WHAT MISS COLEMAN SAW THROUGH THE WINDOW\r\n\r\nAs Miss Coleman had paused, as if her narrative was approaching a\r\nconclusion, I judged it expedient to make an attempt to bring the\r\nrecord as quickly as possible up to date.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I take it, Miss Coleman, that you have observed what has occurred in\r\nthe house to-day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe tightened her nut-cracker jaws and glared at me disdainfully,--her\r\ndignity was ruffled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m coming to it, aren\xe2\x80\x99t I?--if you\xe2\x80\x99ll let me. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve got no\r\nmanners I\xe2\x80\x99ll learn you some. One doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like to be hurried at my time\r\nof life, young man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI was meekly silent;--plainly, if she was to talk, every one else must\r\nlisten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98During the last few days there have been some queer goings on over the\r\nroad,--out of the common queer, I mean, for goodness knows that they\r\nalways have been queer enough. That Arab party has been flitting about\r\nlike a creature possessed,--I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him going in and out twenty times\r\na day. This morning--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe paused,--to fix her eyes on Lessingham. She apparently observed his\r\ngrowing interest as she approached the subject which had brought us\r\nthere,--and resented it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me like that, young man, because I won\xe2\x80\x99t have it. And as\r\nfor questions, I may answer questions when I\xe2\x80\x99m done, but don\xe2\x80\x99t you dare\r\nto ask me one before, because I won\xe2\x80\x99t be interrupted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUp to then Lessingham had not spoken a word,--but it seemed as if she\r\nwas endowed with the faculty of perceiving the huge volume of the words\r\nwhich he had left unuttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This morning--as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said already,--\xe2\x80\x99 she glanced at Lessingham as if\r\nshe defied his contradiction--\xe2\x80\x98when that Arab party came home it was\r\njust on the stroke of seven. I know what was the exact time because,\r\nwhen I went to the door to the milkman, my clock was striking the half\r\nhour, and I always keep it thirty minutes fast. As I was taking the\r\nmilk, the man said to me, \xe2\x80\x9cHollo, Miss Coleman, here\xe2\x80\x99s your friend\r\ncoming along.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat friend?\xe2\x80\x9d I says,--for I ain\xe2\x80\x99t got no friends, as I\r\nknow, round here, nor yet, I hope no enemies neither.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I looks round, and there was the Arab party coming tearing down\r\nthe road, his bedcover thing all flying in the wind, and his arms\r\nstraight out in front of him,--I never did see anyone go at such a\r\npace. \xe2\x80\x9cMy goodness,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder he don\xe2\x80\x99t do himself an injury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder someone else don\xe2\x80\x99t do him an injury,\xe2\x80\x9d says the milkman. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nvery sight of him is enough to make my milk go sour.\xe2\x80\x9d And he picked up\r\nhis pail and went away quite grumpy,--though what that Arab party\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndone to him is more than I can say.--I have always noticed that\r\nmilkman\xe2\x80\x99s temper\xe2\x80\x99s short like his measure. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t best pleased with\r\nhim for speaking of that Arab party as my friend, which he never has\r\nbeen, and never won\xe2\x80\x99t be, and never could be neither.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Five persons went to the house after the milkman was gone, and that\r\nthere Arab party was safe inside,--three of them was commercials, that\r\nI know, because afterwards they came to me. But of course they none of\r\nthem got no chance with that there Arab party except of hammering at\r\nhis front door, which ain\xe2\x80\x99t what you might call a paying game, nor nice\r\nfor the temper, but for that I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame him, for if once those\r\ncommercials do begin talking they\xe2\x80\x99ll talk for ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now I\xe2\x80\x99m coming to this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI thought it was about time,--though for the life of me, I did not dare\r\nto hint as much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, it might have been three, or it might have been half past,\r\nanyhow it was thereabouts, when up there comes two men and a woman,\r\nwhich one of the men was that young man what\xe2\x80\x99s a friend of yours. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI says to myself, \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s something new in callers, I wonder what it is\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re wanting.\xe2\x80\x9d That young man what was a friend of yours, he starts\r\nhammering, and hammering, as the custom was with every one who came,\r\nand, as usual, no more notice was taken of him than nothing,--though I\r\nknew that all the time the Arab party was indoors.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this point I felt that at all hazards I must interpose a question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are sure he was indoors?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe took it better than I feared she might.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,--hadn\xe2\x80\x99t I seen him come in at seven, and he never\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t gone out since, for I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that I\xe2\x80\x99d taken my eyes off\r\nthe place not for two minutes together, and I\xe2\x80\x99d never had a sight of\r\nhim. If he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t indoors, where was he then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor the moment, so far as I was concerned, the query was unanswerable.\r\nShe triumphantly continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Instead of doing what most did, when they\xe2\x80\x99d had enough of hammering,\r\nand going away, these three they went round to the back, and I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nblessed if they mustn\xe2\x80\x99t have got through the kitchen window, woman and\r\nall, for all of a sudden the blind in the front room was pulled not up,\r\nbut down--dragged down it was, and there was that young man what\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nfriend of yours standing with it in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I says to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cif that ain\xe2\x80\x99t cool I should like to know\r\nwhat is. If, when you ain\xe2\x80\x99t let in, you can let yourself in, and that\r\nwithout so much as saying by your leave, or with your leave, things is\r\ncoming to a pretty pass. Wherever can that Arab party be, and whatever\r\ncan he be thinking of, to let them go on like that because that he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe sort to allow a liberty to be took with him, and say nothing, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Every moment I expects to hear a noise and see a row begin, but, so\r\nfar as I could make out, all was quiet and there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t nothing of the\r\nkind. So I says to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s more in this than meets the eye,\r\nand them three parties must have right upon their side, or they\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be doing what they are doing in the way they are, there\xe2\x80\x99d be a\r\nshindy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Presently, in about five minutes, the front door opens, and a young\r\nman--not the one what\xe2\x80\x99s your friend, but the other--comes sailing out,\r\nand through the gate, and down the road, as stiff and upright as a\r\ngrenadier,--I never see anyone walk more upright, and few as fast. At\r\nhis heels comes the young man what is your friend, and it seems to me\r\nthat he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make out what this other was a-doing of. I says to\r\nmyself, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s been a quarrel between them two, and him as has gone\r\nhas hooked it.\xe2\x80\x9d This young man what is your friend he stood at the\r\ngate, all of a fidget, staring after the other with all his eyes, as if\r\nhe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think what to make of him, and the young woman, she stood\r\non the doorstep, staring after him too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As the young man what had hooked it turned the corner, and was out of\r\nsight, all at once your friend he seemed to make up his mind, and he\r\nstarted off running as hard as he could pelt,--and the young woman was\r\nleft alone. I expected, every minute, to see him come back with the\r\nother young man, and the young woman, by the way she hung about the\r\ngate, she seemed to expect it too. But no, nothing of the kind. So\r\nwhen, as I expect, she\xe2\x80\x99d had enough of waiting, she went into the house\r\nagain, and I see her pass the front room window. After a while, back\r\nshe comes to the gate, and stands looking and looking, but nothing was\r\nto be seen of either of them young men. When she\xe2\x80\x99d been at the gate, I\r\ndaresay five minutes, back she goes into the house,--and I never saw\r\nnothing of her again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You never saw anything of her again?--Are you sure she went back into\r\nthe house?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As sure as I am that I see you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t keep a constant watch upon the premises?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But that\xe2\x80\x99s just what I did do. I felt something queer was going on,\r\nand I made up my mind to see it through. And when I make up my mind to\r\na thing like that I\xe2\x80\x99m not easy to turn aside. I never moved off the\r\nchair at my bedroom window, and I never took my eyes off the house, not\r\ntill you come knocking at my front door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, since the young lady is certainly not in the house at present,\r\nshe must have eluded your observation, and, in some manner, have left\r\nit without your seeing her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe she did, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how she could have done,--there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsomething queer about that house, since that Arab party\xe2\x80\x99s been inside\r\nit. But though I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see her, I did see someone else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who was that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A young man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A young man?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, a young man, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what puzzled me, and what\xe2\x80\x99s been puzzling\r\nme ever since, for see him go in I never did do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can you describe him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not as to the face, for he wore a dirty cloth cap pulled down right\r\nover it, and he walked so quickly that I never had a proper look. But I\r\nshould know him anywhere if I saw him, if only because of his clothes\r\nand his walk.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What was there peculiar about his clothes and his walk?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, his clothes were that old, and torn, and dirty, that a ragman\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have given a thank you for them,--and as for fit,--there\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t none, they hung upon him like a scarecrow--he was a regular\r\nfigure of fun; I should think the boys would call after him if they saw\r\nhim in the street. As for his walk, he walked off just like the first\r\nyoung man had done, he strutted along with his shoulders back, and his\r\nhead in the air, and that stiff and straight that my kitchen poker\r\nwould have looked crooked beside of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did nothing happen to attract your attention between the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoing back into the house and the coming out of this young man?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Coleman cogitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now you mention it there did,--though I should have forgotten all\r\nabout it if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t asked me,--that comes of your not letting me\r\ntell the tale in my own way. About twenty minutes after the young woman\r\nhad gone in someone put up the blind in the front room, which that\r\nyoung man had dragged right down, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see who it was for the\r\nblind was between us, and it was about ten minutes after that that\r\nyoung man came marching out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And then what followed?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, in about another ten minutes that Arab party himself comes\r\nscooting through the door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Arab party?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, the Arab party! The sight of him took me clean aback. Where he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbeen, and what he\xe2\x80\x99d been doing with himself while them there people\r\nplayed hi-spy-hi about his premises I\xe2\x80\x99d have given a shilling out of my\r\npocket to have known, but there he was, as large as life, and carrying\r\na bundle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A bundle?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A bundle, on his head, like a muffin-man carries his tray. It was a\r\ngreat thing, you never would have thought he could have carried it, and\r\nit was easy to see that it was as much as he could manage; it bent him\r\nnearly double, and he went crawling along like a snail,--it took him\r\nquite a time to get to the end of the road.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lessingham leaped up from his seat, crying,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Marjorie was in that bundle!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I doubt it,\xe2\x80\x99 I said.\r\n\r\nHe moved about the room distractedly, wringing his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She was! she must have been! God help us all!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I repeat that I doubt it. If you will be advised by me you will wait\r\nawhile before you arrive at any such conclusion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAll at once there was a tapping at the window pane. Atherton was\r\nstaring at us from without.\r\n\r\nHe shouted through the glass,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come out of that, you fossils!--I\xe2\x80\x99ve news for you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLI.\r\n THE CONSTABLE,--HIS CLUE,--AND THE CAB\r\n\r\nMiss Coleman, getting up in a fluster, went hurrying to the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t have that young man in my house. I won\xe2\x80\x99t have him! Don\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nhim dare to put his nose across my doorstep.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI endeavoured to appease her perturbation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I promise you that he shall not come in, Miss Coleman. My friend here,\r\nand I, will go and speak to him outside.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe held the front door open just wide enough to enable Lessingham and\r\nme to slip through, then she shut it after us with a bang. She\r\nevidently had a strong objection to any intrusion on Sydney\xe2\x80\x99s part.\r\n\r\nStanding just without the gate he saluted us with a characteristic\r\nvigour which was scarcely flattering to our late hostess. Behind him\r\nwas a constable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope you two have been mewed in with that old pussy long enough.\r\nWhile you\xe2\x80\x99ve been tittle-tattling I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing,--listen to what this\r\nbobby\xe2\x80\x99s got to say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe constable, his thumbs thrust inside his belt, wore an indulgent\r\nsmile upon his countenance. He seemed to find Sydney amusing. He spoke\r\nin a deep bass voice,--as if it issued from his boots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\xe2\x80\x99ve got anything to say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was plain that Sydney thought otherwise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You wait till I\xe2\x80\x99ve given this pretty pair of gossips a lead, officer,\r\nthen I\xe2\x80\x99ll trot you out.\xe2\x80\x99 He turned to us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98After I\xe2\x80\x99d poked my nose into every dashed hole in that infernal den,\r\nand been rewarded with nothing but a pain in the back for my trouble, I\r\nstood cooling my heels on the doorstep, wondering if I should fight the\r\ncabman, or get him to fight me, just to pass the time away,--for he\r\nsays he can box, and he looks it,--when who should come strolling along\r\nbut this magnificent example of the metropolitan constabulary.\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\nwaved his hand towards the policeman, whose grin grew wider. \xe2\x80\x98I looked\r\nat him, and he looked at me, and then when we\xe2\x80\x99d had enough of admiring\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s fine features and striking proportions, he said to me,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he gone?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWho?--Baxter?--or Bob Brown?\xe2\x80\x9d He said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, the\r\nArab.\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you know about any Arab?\xe2\x80\x9d He said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I saw\r\nhim in the Broadway about three-quarters of an hour ago, and then,\r\nseeing you here, and the house all open, I wondered if he had gone for\r\ngood.\xe2\x80\x9d With that I almost jumped out of my skin, though you can bet\r\nyour life I never showed it. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know it was he?\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was him right enough, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about that. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nseen him once, you\xe2\x80\x99re not likely to forget him.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhere was he going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was talking to a cabman,--four-wheeler. He\xe2\x80\x99d got a great bundle on\r\nhis head,--wanted to take it inside with him. Cabman didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to see\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d That was enough for me,--I picked this most deserving officer up\r\nin my arms, and carried him across the road to you two fellows like a\r\nflash of lightning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSince the policeman was six feet three or four, and more than\r\nsufficiently broad in proportion, his scarcely seemed the kind of\r\nfigure to be picked up in anybody\xe2\x80\x99s arms and carried like a \xe2\x80\x98flash of\r\nlightning,\xe2\x80\x99 which,--as his smile grew more indulgent, he himself\r\nappeared to think.\r\n\r\nStill, even allowing for Atherton\xe2\x80\x99s exaggeration, the news which he had\r\nbrought was sufficiently important. I questioned the constable upon my\r\nown account.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is my card, officer, probably, before the day is over, a charge\r\nof a very serious character will be preferred against the person who\r\nhas been residing in the house over the way. In the meantime it is of\r\nthe utmost importance that a watch should be kept upon his movements. I\r\nsuppose you have no sort of doubt that the person you saw in the\r\nBroadway was the one in question?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a morsel. I know him as well as I do my own brother,--we all do\r\nupon this beat. He\xe2\x80\x99s known amongst us as the Arab. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had my eye on\r\nhim ever since he came to the place. A queer fish he is. I always have\r\nsaid that he\xe2\x80\x99s up to some game or other. I never came across one like\r\nhim for flying about in all sorts of weather, at all hours of the\r\nnight, always tearing along as if for his life. As I was telling this\r\ngentleman I saw him in the Broadway,--well, now it\xe2\x80\x99s about an hour\r\nsince, perhaps a little more. I was coming on duty when I saw a crowd\r\nin front of the District Railway Station,--and there was the Arab,\r\nhaving a sort of argument with the cabman. He had a great bundle on his\r\nhead, five or six feet long, perhaps longer. He wanted to take this\r\ngreat bundle with him into the cab, and the cabman, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You didn\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see him drive off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,--I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t time. I was due at the station,--I was cutting it pretty\r\nfine as it was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak to him,--or to the cabman?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any business of mine you understand. The whole thing\r\njust caught my eye as I was passing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you didn\xe2\x80\x99t take the cabman\xe2\x80\x99s number?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, well, as far as that goes it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t needful. I know the cabman,\r\nhis name and all about him, his stable\xe2\x80\x99s in Bradmore.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI whipped out my note-book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give me his address.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what his Christian name is, Tom, I believe, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nsure. Anyhow his surname\xe2\x80\x99s Ellis and his address is Church Mews, St\r\nJohn\xe2\x80\x99s Road, Bradmore,--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know his number, but any one will tell\r\nyou which is his place, if you ask for Four-Wheel Ellis,--that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nname he\xe2\x80\x99s known by among his pals because of his driving a\r\nfour-wheeler.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, officer. I am obliged to you.\xe2\x80\x99 Two half-crowns changed\r\nhands. \xe2\x80\x98If you will keep an eye on the house and advise me at the\r\naddress which you will find on my card, of any thing which takes place\r\nthere during the next few days, you will do me a service.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe had clambered back into the hansom, the driver was just about to\r\nstart, when the constable was struck by a sudden thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One moment, sir,--blessed if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to forget the most\r\nimportant bit of all. I did hear him tell Ellis where to drive him\r\nto,--he kept saying it over and over again, in that queer lingo of his.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaterloo Railway Station, Waterloo Railway Station.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEllis, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll drive you to Waterloo Railway Station right enough, only\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to have that bundle of yours inside my cab. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nroom for it, so you put it on the roof.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTo Waterloo Railway Station,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Arab, \xe2\x80\x9cI take my bundle with me to Waterloo Railway\r\nStation,--I take it with me.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWho says you don\xe2\x80\x99t take it with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Ellis. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can take it, and twenty more besides, for all I care,\r\nonly you don\xe2\x80\x99t take it inside my cab,--put it on the roof.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI take it\r\nwith me to Waterloo Railway Station,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Arab, and there they\r\nwere, wrangling and jangling, and neither seeming to be able to make\r\nout what the other was after, and the people all laughing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Waterloo Railway Station,--you are sure that was what he said?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll take my oath to it, because I said to myself, when I heard it, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwonder what you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to pay for that little lot, for the District\r\nRailway Station\xe2\x80\x99s outside the four-mile radius.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs we drove off I was inclined to ask myself, a little bitterly--and\r\nperhaps unjustly--if it were not characteristic of the average London\r\npoliceman to almost forget the most important part of his\r\ninformation,--at any rate to leave it to the last and only to bring it\r\nto the front on having his palm crossed with silver.\r\n\r\nAs the hansom bowled along we three had what occasionally approached a\r\nwarm discussion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Marjorie was in that bundle,\xe2\x80\x99 began Lessingham, in the most lugubrious\r\nof tones, and with the most woebegone of faces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I doubt it,\xe2\x80\x99 I observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She was,--I feel it,--I know it. She was either dead and mutilated, or\r\ngagged and drugged and helpless. All that remains is vengeance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I repeat that I doubt it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAtherton struck in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am bound to say, with the best will in the world to think otherwise,\r\nthat I agree with Lessingham.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are wrong.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s all very well for you to talk in that cocksure way, but it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neasier for you to say I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong than to prove it. If I am wrong, and if\r\nLessingham\xe2\x80\x99s wrong, how do you explain his extraordinary insistence on\r\ntaking it inside the cab with him, which the bobby describes? If there\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t something horrible, awful in that bundle of his, of which he\r\nfeared the discovery, why was he so reluctant to have it placed upon\r\nthe roof?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There probably was something in it which he was particularly anxious\r\nshould not be discovered, but I doubt if it was anything of the kind\r\nwhich you suggest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here is Marjorie in a house alone--nothing has been seen of her\r\nsince,--her clothing, her hair, is found hidden away under the floor.\r\nThis scoundrel sallies forth with a huge bundle on his head,--the bobby\r\nspeaks of it being five or six feet long, or longer,--a bundle which he\r\nregards with so much solicitude that he insists on never allowing it to\r\ngo, for a single instant, out of his sight and reach. What is in the\r\nthing? don\xe2\x80\x99t all the facts most unfortunately point in one direction?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lessingham covered his face with his hands, and groaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I fear that Mr Atherton is right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I differ from you both.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSydney at once became heated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then perhaps you can tell us what was in the bundle?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I fancy I could make a guess at the contents.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh you could, could you, then, perhaps, for our sakes, you\xe2\x80\x99ll make\r\nit,--and not play the oracular owl!--Lessingham and I are interested in\r\nthis business, after all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It contained the bearer\xe2\x80\x99s personal property: that, and nothing more.\r\nStay! before you jeer at me, suffer me to finish. If I am not mistaken\r\nas to the identity of the person whom the constable describes as the\r\nArab, I apprehend that the contents of that bundle were of much more\r\nimportance to him than if they had consisted of Miss Lindon, either\r\ndead or living. More. I am inclined to suspect that if the bundle was\r\nplaced on the roof of the cab, and if the driver did meddle with it,\r\nand did find out the contents, and understand them, he would have been\r\ndriven, out of hand, stark staring mad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSydney was silent, as if he reflected. I imagine he perceived there was\r\nsomething in what I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But what has become of Miss Lindon?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I fancy that Miss Lindon, at this moment, is--somewhere; I don\xe2\x80\x99t, just\r\nnow, know exactly where, but I hope very shortly to be able to give you\r\na clearer notion,--attired in a rotten, dirty pair of boots; a filthy,\r\ntattered pair of trousers; a ragged, unwashed apology for a shirt; a\r\ngreasy, ancient, shapeless coat; and a frowsy peaked cloth cap.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey stared at me, opened-eyed. Atherton was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What on earth do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean that it seems to me that the facts point in the direction of my\r\nconclusions rather than yours--and that very strongly too. Miss Coleman\r\nasserts that she saw Miss Lindon return into the house; that within a\r\nfew minutes the blind was replaced at the front window; and that\r\nshortly after a young man, attired in the costume I have described,\r\ncame walking out of the front door. I believe that young man was Miss\r\nMarjorie Lindon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLessingham and Atherton both broke out into interrogations, with\r\nSydney, as usual, loudest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But--man alive! what on earth should make her do a thing like that?\r\nMarjorie, the most retiring, modest girl on all God\xe2\x80\x99s earth, walk about\r\nin broad daylight, in such a costume, and for no reason at all! my dear\r\nChampnell, you are suggesting that she first of all went mad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She was in a state of trance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good God!--Champnell!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you think that--juggling villain did get hold of her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Undoubtedly. Here is my view of the case, mind it is only a hypothesis\r\nand you must take it for what it is worth. It seems to me quite clear\r\nthat the Arab, as we will call the person for the sake of\r\nidentification, was somewhere about the premises when you thought he\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But--where? We looked upstairs, and downstairs, and everywhere--where\r\ncould he have been?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That, as at present advised, I am not prepared to say, but I think you\r\nmay take it for granted that he was there. He hypnotised the man Holt,\r\nand sent him away, intending you to go after him, and so being rid of\r\nyou both--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The deuce he did, Champnell! You write me down an ass!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As soon as the coast was clear he discovered himself to Miss Lindon,\r\nwho, I expect, was disagreeably surprised, and hypnotised her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The hound!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The devil!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe first exclamation was Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s, the second Sydney\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He then constrained her to strip herself to the skin--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The wretch!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The fiend!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He cut off her hair; he hid it and her clothes under the floor where\r\nwe found them--where I think it probable that he had already some\r\nancient masculine garments concealed--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By Jove! I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if they were Holt\xe2\x80\x99s. I remember the\r\nman saying that that nice joker stripped him of his duds,--and\r\ncertainly when I saw him,--and when Marjorie found him!--he had\r\nabsolutely nothing on but a queer sort of cloak. Can it be possible\r\nthat that humorous professor of hankey-pankey--may all the maledictions\r\nof the accursed alight upon his head!--can have sent Marjorie Lindon,\r\nthe daintiest damsel in the land!--into the streets of London rigged\r\nout in Holt\xe2\x80\x99s old togs!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As to that, I am not able to give an authoritative opinion, but, if I\r\nunderstand you aright, it at least is possible. Anyhow I am disposed to\r\nthink that he sent Miss Lindon after the man Holt, taking it for\r\ngranted that he had eluded you.--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s it. Write me down an ass again!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That he did elude you, you have yourself admitted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s because I stopped talking with that mutton-headed bobby,--I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhave followed the man to the ends of the earth if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Precisely; the reason is immaterial, it is the fact with which we are\r\nimmediately concerned. He did elude you. And I think you will find that\r\nMiss Lindon and Mr Holt are together at this moment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In men\xe2\x80\x99s clothing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Both in men\xe2\x80\x99s clothing, or, rather, Miss Lindon is in a man\xe2\x80\x99s rags.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Great Potiphar! To think of Marjorie like that!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And where they are, the Arab is not very far off either.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLessingham caught me by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what diabolical mischief do you imagine that he proposes to do to\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI shirked the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whatever it is, it is our business to prevent his doing it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And where do you think they have been taken?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That it will be our immediate business to endeavour to discover,--and\r\nhere, at any rate, we are at Waterloo.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLII.\r\n THE QUARRY DOUBLES\r\n\r\nI turned towards the booking-office on the main departure platform. As\r\nI went, the chief platform inspector, George Bellingham, with whom I\r\nhad some acquaintance, came out of his office. I stopped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Bellingham, will you be so good as to step with me to the\r\nbooking-office, and instruct the clerk in charge to answer one or two\r\nquestions which I wish to put to him. I will explain to you afterwards\r\nwhat is their exact import, but you know me sufficiently to be able to\r\nbelieve me when I say that they refer to a matter in which every moment\r\nis of the first importance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe turned and accompanied us into the interior of the booking-case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To which of the clerks, Mr Champnell, do you wish to put your\r\nquestions?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To the one who issues third-class tickets to Southampton.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBellingham beckoned to a man who was counting a heap of money, and\r\napparently seeking to make it tally with the entries in a huge ledger\r\nwhich lay open before him,--he was a short, slightly-built young\r\nfellow, with a pleasant face and smiling eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Stone, this gentleman wishes to ask you one or two questions.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am at his service.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI put my questions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I want to know, Mr Stone, if, in the course of the day, you have\r\nissued any tickets to a person dressed in Arab costume?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis reply was prompt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have--by the last train, the 7.25,--three singles.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThree singles! Then my instinct had told me rightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can you describe the person?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Stone\xe2\x80\x99s eyes twinkled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I can, except in a general way,--he was uncommonly\r\nold and uncommonly ugly, and he had a pair of the most extraordinary\r\neyes I ever saw,--they gave me a sort of all-overish feeling when I saw\r\nthem glaring at me through the pigeon hole. But I can tell you one\r\nthing about him, he had a great bundle on his head, which he steadied\r\nwith one hand, and as it bulged out in all directions its presence\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t make him popular with other people who wanted tickets too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly this was our man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are sure he asked for three tickets?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certain. He said three tickets to Southampton; laid down the exact\r\nfare,--nineteen and six--and held up three fingers--like that. Three\r\nnasty looking fingers they were, with nails as long as talons.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You didn\xe2\x80\x99t see who were his companions?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t,--I didn\xe2\x80\x99t try to look. I gave him his tickets and off he\r\nwent,--with the people grumbling at him because that bundle of his kept\r\ngetting in their way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBellingham touched me on the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can tell you about the Arab of whom Mr Stone speaks. My attention\r\nwas called to him by his insisting on taking his bundle with him into\r\nthe carriage,--it was an enormous thing, he could hardly squeeze it\r\nthrough the door; it occupied the entire seat. But as there weren\xe2\x80\x99t as\r\nmany passengers as usual, and he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t or couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be made to\r\nunderstand that his precious bundle would be safe in the luggage van\r\nalong with the rest of the luggage, and as he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the sort of person\r\nyou could argue with to any advantage, I had him put into an empty\r\ncompartment, bundle and all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was he alone then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought so at the time, he said nothing about having more than one\r\nticket, or any companions, but just before the train started two other\r\nmen--English men--got into his compartment; and as I came down the\r\nplatform, the ticket inspector at the barrier informed me that these\r\ntwo men were with him, because he held tickets for the three, which, as\r\nhe was a foreigner, and they seemed English, struck the inspector as\r\nodd.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Could you describe the two men?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, not particularly, but the man who had charge of the\r\nbarrier might. I was at the other end of the train when they got in.\r\nAll I noticed was that one seemed to be a commonplace looking\r\nindividual and that the other was dressed like a tramp, all rags and\r\ntatters, a disreputable looking object he appeared to be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That,\xe2\x80\x99 I said to myself, \xe2\x80\x98was Miss Marjorie Lindon, the lovely\r\ndaughter of a famous house; the wife-elect of a coming statesman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo Bellingham I remarked aloud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I want you to strain a point, Mr Bellingham, and to do me a service\r\nwhich I assure you you shall never have any cause to regret. I want you\r\nto wire instructions down the line to detain this Arab and his\r\ncompanions and to keep them in custody until the receipt of further\r\ninstructions. They are not wanted by the police as yet, but they will\r\nbe as soon as I am able to give certain information to the authorities\r\nat Scotland Yard,--and wanted very badly. But, as you will perceive for\r\nyourself, until I am able to give that information every moment is\r\nimportant.--Where\xe2\x80\x99s the Station Superintendent?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s gone. At present I\xe2\x80\x99m in charge.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then will you do this for me? I repeat that you shall never have any\r\nreason to regret it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will if you\xe2\x80\x99ll accept all responsibility.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll do that with the greatest pleasure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBellingham looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s about twenty minutes to nine. The train\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled for\r\nBasingstoke at 9.6. If we wire to Basingstoke at once they ought to be\r\nready for them when they come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe wire was sent.\r\n\r\nWe were shown into Bellingham\xe2\x80\x99s office to await results. Lessingham\r\npaced agitatedly to and fro; he seemed to have reached the limits of\r\nhis self-control, and to be in a condition in which movement of some\r\nsort was an absolute necessity. The mercurial Sydney, on the contrary,\r\nleaned back in a chair, his legs stretched out in front of him, his\r\nhands thrust deep into his trouser pockets, and stared at Lessingham,\r\nas if he found relief to his feelings in watching his companion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrestlessness. I, for my part, drew up as full a pr\xc3\xa9cis of the case as I\r\ndeemed advisable, and as time permitted, which I despatched by one of\r\nthe company\xe2\x80\x99s police to Scotland Yard.\r\n\r\nThen I turned to my associates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, gentlemen, it\xe2\x80\x99s past dinner time. We may have a journey in front\r\nof us. If you take my advice you\xe2\x80\x99ll have something to eat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLessingham shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I want nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor I,\xe2\x80\x99 echoed Sydney.\r\n\r\nI started up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must pardon my saying nonsense, but surely you of all men, Mr\r\nLessingham, should be aware that you will not improve the situation by\r\nrendering yourself incapable of seeing it through. Come and dine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI haled them off with me, willy nilly, to the refreshment room. I\r\ndined,--after a fashion; Mr Lessingham swallowed with difficulty, a\r\nplate of soup; Sydney nibbled at a plate of the most unpromising\r\nlooking \xe2\x80\x98chicken and ham,\xe2\x80\x99--he proved, indeed, more intractable than\r\nLessingham, and was not to be persuaded to tackle anything easier of\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\nI was just about to take cheese after chop when Bellingham came\r\nhastening in, in his hand an open telegram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The birds have flown,\xe2\x80\x99 he cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Flown!--How?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn reply he gave me the telegram. I glanced at it. It ran:\r\n\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Persons described not in the train. Guard says they got out at\r\n Vauxhall. Have wired Vauxhall to advise you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a level-headed chap,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bellingham. \xe2\x80\x98The man who sent that\r\ntelegram. His wiring to Vauxhall should save us a lot of time,--we\r\nought to hear from there directly. Hollo! what\xe2\x80\x99s this? I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nsurprised if this is it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he spoke a porter entered,--he handed an envelope to Bellingham. We\r\nall three kept our eyes fixed on the inspector\xe2\x80\x99s face as he opened it.\r\nWhen he perceived the contents he gave an exclamation of surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This Arab of yours, and his two friends, seem rather a curious lot, Mr\r\nChampnell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe passed the paper on to me. It took the form of a report. Lessingham\r\nand Sydney, regardless of forms and ceremonies, leaned over my shoulder\r\nas I read it.\r\n\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Passengers by 7.30 Southampton, on arrival of train, complained of\r\n noises coming from a compartment in coach 8964. Stated that there had\r\n been shrieks and yells ever since the train left Waterloo, as if\r\n someone was being murdered. An Arab and two Englishmen got out of the\r\n compartment in question, apparently the party referred to in wire just\r\n to hand from Basingstoke. All three declared that there was nothing the\r\n matter. That they had been shouting for fun. Arab gave up three third\r\n singles for Southampton, saying, in reply to questions, that they had\r\n changed their minds, and did not want to go any farther. As there were\r\n no signs of a struggle or of violence, nor, apparently, any definite\r\n cause for detention, they were allowed to pass. They took a\r\n four-wheeler, No. 09435. The Arab and one man went inside, and the\r\n other man on the box. They asked to be driven to Commercial Road,\r\n Limehouse. The cab has since returned. Driver says he put the three men\r\n down, at their request, in Commercial Road, at the corner of Sutcliffe\r\n Street, near the East India Docks. They walked up Sutcliffe Street, the\r\n Englishmen in front, and the Arab behind, took the first turning to the\r\n right, and after that he saw nothing of them. The driver further states\r\n that all the way the Englishman inside, who was so ragged and dirty\r\n that he was reluctant to carry him, kept up a sort of wailing noise\r\n which so attracted his attention that he twice got off his box to see\r\n what was the matter, and each time he said it was nothing. The cabman\r\n is of opinion that both the Englishmen were of weak intellect. We were\r\n of the same impression here. They said nothing, except at the seeming\r\n instigation of the Arab, but when spoken to stared and gaped like\r\n lunatics.\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98It may be mentioned that the Arab had with him an enormous bundle,\r\n which he persisted, in spite of all remonstrances, on taking with him\r\n inside the cab.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as I had mastered the contents of the report, and perceived\r\nwhat I believed to be--unknown to the writer himself--its hideous inner\r\nmeaning, I turned to Bellingham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With your permission, Mr Bellingham, I will keep this\r\ncommunication,--it will be safe in my hands, you will be able to get a\r\ncopy, and it may be necessary that I should have the original to show\r\nto the police. If any inquiries are made for me from Scotland Yard,\r\ntell them that I have gone to the Commercial Road, and that I will\r\nreport my movements from Limehouse Police Station.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn another minute we were once more traversing the streets of\r\nLondon,--three in a hansom cab.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLIII.\r\n THE MURDER AT MRS \xe2\x80\x99ENDERSON\xe2\x80\x99S\r\n\r\nIt is something of a drive from Waterloo to Limehouse,--it seems longer\r\nwhen all your nerves are tingling with anxiety to reach your journey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nend; and the cab I had hit upon proved to be not the fastest I might\r\nhave chosen. For some time after our start, we were silent. Each was\r\noccupied with his own thoughts.\r\n\r\nThen Lessingham, who was sitting at my side, said to me,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Champnell, you have that report.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you let me see it once more?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI gave it to him. He read it once, twice,--and I fancy yet again. I\r\npurposely avoided looking at him as he did so. Yet all the while I was\r\nconscious of his pallid cheeks, the twitched muscles of his mouth, the\r\nfeverish glitter of his eyes,--this Leader of Men, whose predominate\r\ncharacteristic in the House of Commons was immobility, was rapidly\r\napproximating to the condition of a hysterical woman. The mental strain\r\nwhich he had been recently undergoing was proving too much for his\r\nphysical strength. This disappearance of the woman he loved bade fair\r\nto be the final straw. I felt convinced that unless something was done\r\nquickly to relieve the strain upon his mind he was nearer to a state of\r\ncomplete mental and moral collapse than he himself imagined. Had he\r\nbeen under my orders I should have commanded him to at once return\r\nhome, and not to think; but conscious that, as things were, such a\r\ndirection would be simply futile, I decided to do something else\r\ninstead. Feeling that suspense was for him the worst possible form of\r\nsuffering I resolved to explain, so far as I was able, precisely what\r\nit was I feared, and how I proposed to prevent it.\r\n\r\nPresently there came the question for which I had been waiting, in a\r\nharsh, broken voice which no one who had heard him speak on a public\r\nplatform, or in the House of Commons, would have recognised as his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Champnell,--who do you think this person is of whom the report from\r\nVauxhall Station speaks as being all in rags and tatters?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe knew perfectly well,--but I understood the mental attitude which\r\ninduced him to prefer that the information should seem to come from me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope that it will prove to be Miss Lindon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hope!\xe2\x80\x99 He gave a sort of gasp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, hope,--because if it is I think it possible, nay probable, that\r\nwithin a few hours you will have her again enfolded in your arms.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray God that it may be so! pray God!--pray the good God!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI did not dare to look round for, from the tremor which was in his\r\ntone, I was persuaded that in the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were tears. Atherton\r\ncontinued silent. He was leaning half out of the cab, staring straight\r\nahead, as if he saw in front a young girl\xe2\x80\x99s face, from which he could\r\nnot remove his glance, and which beckoned him on.\r\n\r\nAfter a while Lessingham spoke again, as if half to himself and half to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This mention of the shrieks on the railway, and of the wailing noise\r\nin the cab,--what must this wretch have done to her? How my darling\r\nmust have suffered!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat was a theme on which I myself scarcely ventured to allow my\r\nthoughts to rest. The notion of a gently-nurtured girl being at the\r\nmercy of that fiend incarnate, possessed--as I believed that so-called\r\nArab to be possessed--of all the paraphernalia of horror and of dread,\r\nwas one which caused me tangible shrinkings of the body. Whence had\r\ncome those shrieks and yells, of which the writer of the report spoke,\r\nwhich had caused the Arab\xe2\x80\x99s fellow-passengers to think that murder was\r\nbeing done? What unimaginable agony had caused them? what speechless\r\ntorture? And the \xe2\x80\x98wailing noise,\xe2\x80\x99 which had induced the prosaic,\r\nindurated London cabman to get twice off his box to see what was the\r\nmatter, what anguish had been provocative of that? The helpless girl\r\nwho had already endured so much, endured, perhaps, that to which death\r\nwould have been preferred!--shut up in that rattling, jolting box on\r\nwheels, alone with that diabolical Asiatic, with the enormous bundle,\r\nwhich was but the lurking place of nameless terrors,--what might she\r\nnot, while being borne through the heart of civilised London, have been\r\nmade to suffer? What had she not been made to suffer to have kept up\r\nthat continued \xe2\x80\x98wailing noise\xe2\x80\x99?\r\n\r\nIt was not a theme on which it was wise to permit one\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts to\r\nlinger,--and particularly was it clear that it was one from which\r\nLessingham\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts should have been kept as far as possible away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, Mr Lessingham, neither you nor I will do himself any good by\r\npermitting his reflections to flow in a morbid channel. Let us talk of\r\nsomething else. By the way, weren\xe2\x80\x99t you due to speak in the House\r\nto-night?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Due!--Yes, I was due,--but what does it matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But have you acquainted no one with the cause of your non-attendance?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Acquaint!--whom should I acquaint?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My good sir! Listen to me, Mr Lessingham. Let me entreat you very\r\nearnestly, to follow my advice. Call another cab,--or take this! and go\r\nat once to the House. It is not too late. Play the man, deliver the\r\nspeech you have undertaken to deliver, perform your political duties.\r\nBy coming with me you will be a hindrance rather than a help, and you\r\nmay do your reputation an injury from which it never may recover. Do as\r\nI counsel you, and I will undertake to do my very utmost to let you\r\nhave good news by the time your speech is finished.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe turned on me with a bitterness for which I was unprepared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I were to go down to the House, and try to speak in the state in\r\nwhich I am now, they would laugh at me, I should be ruined.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you not run an equally great risk of being ruined by staying away?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe gripped me by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Champnell, do you know that I am on the verge of madness? Do you\r\nknow that as I am sitting here by your side I am living in a dual\r\nworld? I am going on and on to catch that--that fiend, and I am back\r\nagain in that Egyptian den, upon that couch of rugs, with the Woman of\r\nthe Songs beside me, and Marjorie is being torn and tortured, and burnt\r\nbefore my eyes! God help me! Her shrieks are ringing in my ears!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe did not speak loudly, but his voice was none the less impressive on\r\nthat account. I endeavoured my hardest to be stern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I confess that you disappoint me, Mr Lessingham. I have always\r\nunderstood that you were a man of unusual strength; you appear instead,\r\nto be a man of extraordinary weakness; with an imagination so\r\nill-governed that its ebullitions remind me of nothing so much as\r\nfeminine hysterics. Your wild language is not warranted by\r\ncircumstances. I repeat that I think it quite possible that by\r\nto-morrow morning she will be returned to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,--but how? as the Marjorie I have known, as I saw her last,--or\r\nhow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat was the question which I had already asked myself, in what\r\ncondition would she be when we had succeeded in snatching her from her\r\ncaptor\xe2\x80\x99s grip? It was a question to which I had refused to supply an\r\nanswer. To him I lied by implication.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let us hope that, with the exception of being a trifle scared, she\r\nwill be as sound and hale and hearty as ever in her life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you yourself believe that she\xe2\x80\x99ll be like that,--untouched,\r\nunchanged, unstained?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen I lied right out,--it seemed to me necessary to calm his growing\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Lessingham!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think that I can\xe2\x80\x99t see your face and read in it the same\r\nthoughts which trouble me? As a man of honour do you care to deny that\r\nwhen Marjorie Lindon is restored to me,--if she ever is!--you fear she\r\nwill be but the mere soiled husk of the Marjorie whom I knew and loved?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Even supposing that there may be a modicum of truth in what you\r\nsay,--which I am far from being disposed to admit--what good purpose do\r\nyou propose to serve by talking in such a strain?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98None,--no good purpose,--unless it be the desire of looking the truth\r\nin the face. For, Mr Champnell, you must not seek to play with me the\r\nhypocrite, nor try to hide things from me as if I were a child. If my\r\nlife is ruined--it is ruined,--let me know it, and look the knowledge\r\nin the face. That, to me, is to play the man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI was silent.\r\n\r\nThe wild tale he had told me of that Cairene inferno, oddly enough--yet\r\nwhy oddly, for the world is all coincidence!--had thrown a flood of\r\nlight on certain events which had happened some three years previously\r\nand which ever since had remained shrouded in mystery. The conduct of\r\nthe business afterwards came into my hands,--and briefly, what had\r\noccurred was this:\r\n\r\nThree persons,--two sisters and their brother, who was younger than\r\nthemselves, members of a decent English family, were going on a trip\r\nround the world. They were young, adventurous, and--not to put too fine\r\na point on it--foolhardy. The evening after their arrival in Cairo, by\r\nway of what is called \xe2\x80\x98a lark,\xe2\x80\x99 in spite of the protestations of people\r\nwho were better informed than themselves, they insisted on going,\r\nalone, for a ramble through the native quarter.\r\n\r\nThey went,--but they never returned. Or, rather the two girls never\r\nreturned. After an interval the young man was found again,--what was\r\nleft of him. A fuss was made when there were no signs of their\r\nre-appearance, but as there were no relations, nor even friends of\r\ntheirs, but only casual acquaintances on board the ship by which they\r\nhad travelled, perhaps not so great a fuss as might have been was made.\r\nAnyhow, nothing was discovered. Their widowed mother, alone in England,\r\nwondering how it was that beyond the receipt of a brief wire,\r\nacquainting her with their arrival at Cairo, she had heard nothing\r\nfurther of their wanderings, placed herself in communication with the\r\ndiplomatic people over there,--to learn that, to all appearances, her\r\nthree children had vanished from off the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nThen a fuss was made,--with a vengeance. So far as one can judge the\r\nwhole town and neighbourhood was turned pretty well upside down. But\r\nnothing came of it,--so far as any results were concerned, the\r\nauthorities might just as well have left the mystery of their\r\nvanishment alone. It continued where it was in spite of them.\r\n\r\nHowever, some three months afterwards a youth was brought to the\r\nBritish Embassy by a party of friendly Arabs who asserted that they had\r\nfound him naked and nearly dying in some remote spot in the Wady Halfa\r\ndesert. It was the brother of the two lost girls. He was as nearly\r\ndying as he very well could be without being actually dead when they\r\nbrought him to the Embassy,--and in a state of indescribable\r\nmutilation. He seemed to rally for a time under careful treatment, but\r\nhe never again uttered a coherent word. It was only from his delirious\r\nravings that any idea was formed of what had really occurred.\r\n\r\nShorthand notes were taken of some of the utterances of his delirium.\r\nAfterwards they were submitted to me. I remembered the substance of\r\nthem quite well, and when Mr Lessingham began to tell me of his own\r\nhideous experiences they came back to me more clearly still. Had I laid\r\nthose notes before him I have little doubt but that he would have\r\nimmediately perceived that seventeen years after the adventure which\r\nhad left such an indelible scar upon his own life, this youth--he was\r\nlittle more than a boy--had seen the things which he had seen, and\r\nsuffered the nameless agonies and degradations which he had suffered.\r\nThe young man was perpetually raving about some indescribable den of\r\nhorror which was own brother to Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s temple and about some\r\nfemale monster, whom he regarded with such fear and horror that every\r\nallusion he made to her was followed by a convulsive paroxysm which\r\ntaxed all the ingenuity of his medical attendants to bring him out of.\r\nHe frequently called upon his sisters by name, speaking of them in a\r\nmanner which inevitably suggested that he had been an unwilling and\r\nhelpless witness of hideous tortures which they had undergone; and then\r\nhe would rise in bed, screaming, \xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99re burning them! they\xe2\x80\x99re burning\r\nthem! Devils! devils!\xe2\x80\x99 And at those times it required all the strength\r\nof those who were in attendance to restrain his maddened frenzy.\r\n\r\nThe youth died in one of these fits of great preternatural excitement,\r\nwithout, as I have previously written, having given utterance to one\r\nsingle coherent word, and by some of those who were best able to judge\r\nit was held to have been a mercy that he did die without having been\r\nrestored to consciousness. And, presently, tales began to be whispered,\r\nabout some idolatrous sect, which was stated to have its headquarters\r\nsomewhere in the interior of the country--some located it in this\r\nneighbourhood, and some in that--which was stated to still practise,\r\nand to always have practised, in unbroken historical continuity, the\r\ndebased, unclean, mystic, and bloody rites, of a form of idolatry which\r\nhad had its birth in a period of the world\xe2\x80\x99s story which was so remote,\r\nthat to all intents and purposes it might be described as pre-historic.\r\n\r\nWhile the ferment was still at its height, a man came to the British\r\nEmbassy who said that he was a member of a tribe which had its habitat\r\non the banks of the White Nile. He asserted that he was in association\r\nwith this very idolatrous sect,--though he denied that he was one of\r\nthe actual sectaries. He did admit, however, that he had assisted more\r\nthan once at their orgies, and declared that it was their constant\r\npractice to offer young women as sacrifices--preferably white Christian\r\nwomen, with a special preference, if they could get them, to young\r\nEnglish women. He vowed that he himself had seen with his own eyes,\r\nEnglish girls burnt alive. The description which he gave of what\r\npreceded and followed these foul murders appalled those who listened.\r\nHe finally wound up by offering, on payment of a stipulated sum of\r\nmoney, to guide a troop of soldiers to this den of demons, so that they\r\nshould arrive there at a moment when it was filled with worshippers,\r\nwho were preparing to participate in an orgie which was to take place\r\nduring the next few days.\r\n\r\nHis offer was conditionally accepted. He was confined in an apartment\r\nwith one man on guard inside and another on guard outside the room.\r\nThat night the sentinel without was startled by hearing a great noise\r\nand frightful screams issuing from the chamber in which the native was\r\ninterned. He summoned assistance. The door was opened. The soldier on\r\nguard within was stark, staring mad,--he died within a few months, a\r\ngibbering maniac to the end. The native was dead. The window, which was\r\na very small one, was securely fastened inside and strongly barred\r\nwithout. There was nothing to show by what means entry had been gained.\r\nYet it was the general opinion of those who saw the corpse that the man\r\nhad been destroyed by some wild beast. A photograph was taken of the\r\nbody after death, a copy of which is still in my possession. In it are\r\ndistinctly shown lacerations about the neck and the lower portion of\r\nthe abdomen, as if they had been produced by the claws of some huge and\r\nferocious animal. The skull is splintered in half-a-dozen places, and\r\nthe face is torn to rags.\r\n\r\nThat was more than three years ago. The whole business has remained as\r\ngreat a mystery as ever. But my attention has once or twice been caught\r\nby trifling incidents, which have caused me to more than suspect that\r\nthe wild tale told by that murdered native had in it at least the\r\nelements of truth; and which have even led me to wonder if the trade in\r\nkidnapping was not being carried on to this very hour, and if women of\r\nmy own flesh and blood were not still being offered up on that infernal\r\naltar. And now, here was Paul Lessingham, a man of world-wide\r\nreputation, of great intellect, of undoubted honour, who had come to me\r\nwith a wholly unconscious verification of all my worst suspicions!\r\n\r\nThat the creature spoken of as an Arab,--and who was probably no more\r\nan Arab than I was, and whose name was certainly not Mohamed el\r\nKheir!--was an emissary from that den of demons, I had no doubt. What\r\nwas the exact purport of the creature\xe2\x80\x99s presence in England was another\r\nquestion. Possibly part of the intention was the destruction of Paul\r\nLessingham, body, soul and spirit; possibly another part was the\r\nprocuration of fresh victims for that long-drawn-out holocaust. That\r\nthis latter object explained the disappearance of Miss Lindon I felt\r\npersuaded. That she was designed by the personification of evil who was\r\nher captor, to suffer all the horrors at which the stories pointed, and\r\nthen to be burned alive, amidst the triumphant yells of the attendant\r\ndemons, I was certain. That the wretch, aware that the pursuit was in\r\nfull cry, was tearing, twisting, doubling, and would stick at nothing\r\nwhich would facilitate the smuggling of the victim out of England, was\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nMy interest in the quest was already far other than a merely\r\nprofessional one. The blood in my veins tingled at the thought of such\r\na woman as Miss Lindon being in the power of such a monster. I may\r\nassuredly claim that throughout the whole business I was urged forward\r\nby no thought of fee or of reward. To have had a share in rescuing that\r\nunfortunate girl, and in the destruction of her noxious persecutor,\r\nwould have been reward enough for me.\r\n\r\nOne is not always, even in strictly professional matters, influenced by\r\nstrictly professional instincts.\r\n\r\nThe cab slowed. A voice descended through the trap door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is Commercial Road, sir,--what part of it do you want?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Drive me to Limehouse Police Station.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe were driven there. I made my way to the usual inspector behind the\r\nusual pigeon-hole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My name is Champnell. Have you received any communication from\r\nScotland Yard to-night having reference to a matter in which I am\r\ninterested?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you mean about the Arab? We received a telephonic message about\r\nhalf an hour ago.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Since communicating with Scotland Yard this has come to hand from the\r\nauthorities at Vauxhall Station. Can you tell me if anything has been\r\nseen of the person in question by the men of your division?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI handed the Inspector the \xe2\x80\x98report.\xe2\x80\x99 His reply was laconic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will inquire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe passed through a door into an inner room and the \xe2\x80\x98report\xe2\x80\x99 went with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beg pardon, sir, but was that a Harab you was a-talking about to the\r\nHinspector?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe speaker was a gentleman unmistakably of the guttersnipe class. He\r\nwas seated on a form. Close at hand hovered a policeman whose special\r\nduty it seemed to be to keep an eye upon his movements.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why do you ask?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, sir, but I saw a Harab myself about a hour\r\nago,--leastways he looked like as if he was a Harab.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What sort of a looking person was he?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99ardly tell you that, sir, because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t never have a\r\nproper look at him,--but I know he had a bloomin\xe2\x80\x99 great bundle on \xe2\x80\x99is\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ead.\xe2\x80\xa6 It was like this, \xe2\x80\x99ere. I was comin\xe2\x80\x99 round the corner, as he\r\nwas passin\xe2\x80\x99, I never see \xe2\x80\x99im till I was right atop of \xe2\x80\x99im, so that I\r\nhaccidentally run agin \xe2\x80\x99im,--my heye! didn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99e give me a downer! I was\r\ndown on the back of my \xe2\x80\x99ead in the middle of the road before I knew\r\nwhere I was and \xe2\x80\x99e was at the other end of the street. If \xe2\x80\x99e \xe2\x80\x99adn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknocked me more\xe2\x80\x99n \xe2\x80\x99arf silly I\xe2\x80\x99d been after \xe2\x80\x99im, sharp,--I tell you!\r\nand hasked \xe2\x80\x99im what \xe2\x80\x99e thought \xe2\x80\x99e was a-doin\xe2\x80\x99 of, but afore my senses\r\nwas back agin \xe2\x80\x99e was out o\xe2\x80\x99 sight,--clean!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are sure he had a bundle on his head?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I noticed it most particular.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How long ago do you say this was? and where?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98About a hour ago,--perhaps more, perhaps less.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was he alone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It seemed to me as if a cove was a follerin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99im, leastways there was\r\na bloke as was a-keepin\xe2\x80\x99 close at \xe2\x80\x99is \xe2\x80\x99eels,--though I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\n\xe2\x80\x99is little game was, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. Ask the pleesman--he knows, he knows\r\neverythink, the pleesman do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI turned to the \xe2\x80\x98pleesman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is this man?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x98pleesman\xe2\x80\x99 put his hands behind his back, and threw out his chest.\r\nHis manner was distinctly affable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,--he\xe2\x80\x99s being detained upon suspicion. He\xe2\x80\x99s given us an address at\r\nwhich to make inquiries, and inquiries are being made. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pay\r\ntoo much attention to what he says if I were you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbe particular about a lie or two.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis frank expression of opinion re-aroused the indignation of the\r\ngentleman on the form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There you hare! at it again! That\xe2\x80\x99s just like you peelers,--you\xe2\x80\x99re all\r\nthe same! What do you know about me?--Nuffink! This gen\xe2\x80\x99leman ain\xe2\x80\x99t got\r\nno call to believe me, not as I knows on,--it\xe2\x80\x99s all the same to me if\r\n\xe2\x80\x99e do or don\xe2\x80\x99t, but it\xe2\x80\x99s trewth what I\xe2\x80\x99m sayin\xe2\x80\x99, all the same.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this point the Inspector re-appeared at the pigeon-hole. He cut\r\nshort the flow of eloquence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now then, not so much noise outside there!\xe2\x80\x99 He addressed me. \xe2\x80\x98None of\r\nour men have seen anything of the person you\xe2\x80\x99re inquiring for, so far\r\nas we\xe2\x80\x99re aware. But, if you like, I will place a man at your disposal,\r\nand he will go round with you, and you will be able to make your own\r\ninquiries.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA capless, wildly excited young ragamuffin came dashing in at the\r\nstreet door. He gasped out, as clearly as he could for the speed which\r\nhe had made:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s been murder done, Mr Pleesman,--a Harab\xe2\x80\x99s killed a bloke.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Pleesman\xe2\x80\x99 gripped him by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe youngster put up his arm, and ducked his head, instinctively, as if\r\nto ward off a blow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Leave me alone! I don\xe2\x80\x99t want none of your \xe2\x80\x99andling!--I ain\xe2\x80\x99t done\r\nnuffink to you! I tell you \xe2\x80\x99e \xe2\x80\x99as!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Inspector spoke through the pigeon-hole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has what, my lad? What do you say has happened?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s been murder done--it\xe2\x80\x99s right enough!--there \xe2\x80\x99as!--up at Mrs\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Enderson\xe2\x80\x99s, in Paradise Place,--a Harab\xe2\x80\x99s been and killed a bloke!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLIV.\r\n THE MAN WHO WAS MURDERED\r\n\r\nThe Inspector spoke to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If what the boy says is correct it sounds as if the person whom you\r\nare seeking may have had a finger in the pie.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI was of the same opinion, as, apparently, were Lessingham and Sydney.\r\nAtherton collared the youth by the shoulder which Mr Pleesman had left\r\ndisengaged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What sort of looking bloke is it who\xe2\x80\x99s been murdered?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I dunno! I \xe2\x80\x99aven\xe2\x80\x99t seen \xe2\x80\x99im! Mrs \xe2\x80\x99Enderson, she says to me! \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Gustus\r\nBarley,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, \xe2\x80\x9ca bloke\xe2\x80\x99s been murdered. That there Harab what I\r\nchucked out \xe2\x80\x99alf a hour ago been and murdered \xe2\x80\x99im, and left \xe2\x80\x99im behind\r\nup in my back room. You run as \xe2\x80\x99ard as you can tear and tell them there\r\ndratted pleese what\xe2\x80\x99s so fond of shovin\xe2\x80\x99 their dirty noses into\r\nrespectable people\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99ouses.\xe2\x80\x9d So I comes and tells yer. That\xe2\x80\x99s all I\r\nknows about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe went four in the hansom which had been waiting in the street to Mrs\r\nHenderson\xe2\x80\x99s in Paradise Place,--the Inspector and we three. \xe2\x80\x98Mr\r\nPleesman\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Gustus Barley\xe2\x80\x99 followed on foot. The Inspector was\r\nexplanatory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs Henderson keeps a sort of lodging-house,--a \xe2\x80\x9cSailors\xe2\x80\x99 Home\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncalls it, but no one could call it sweet. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bear the best of\r\ncharacters, and if you asked me what I thought of it, I should say in\r\nplain English that it was a disorderly house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nParadise Place proved to be within three or four hundred yards of the\r\nStation House. So far as could be seen in the dark it consisted of a\r\nrow of houses of considerable dimensions,--and also of considerable\r\nantiquity. They opened on to two or three stone steps which led\r\ndirectly into the street. At one of the doors stood an old lady with a\r\nshawl drawn over her head. This was Mrs Henderson. She greeted us with\r\ngarrulous volubility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So you \xe2\x80\x99ave come, \xe2\x80\x99ave you? I thought you never was a-comin\xe2\x80\x99 that I\r\ndid.\xe2\x80\x99 She recognised the Inspector. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s you, Mr Phillips, is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nPerceiving us, she drew a little back. \xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s them \xe2\x80\x99ere parties? They\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t coppers?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Phillips dismissed her inquiry, curtly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never you mind who they are. What\xe2\x80\x99s this about someone being murdered.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ssh!\xe2\x80\x99 The old lady glanced round. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you speak so loud, Mr\r\nPhillips. No one don\xe2\x80\x99t know nothing about it as yet. The parties what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nin my \xe2\x80\x99ouse is most respectable,--most! and they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t abide the\r\nnotion of there being police about the place.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We quite believe that, Mrs Henderson.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Inspector\xe2\x80\x99s tone was grim.\r\n\r\nMrs Henderson led the way up a staircase which would have been\r\ndistinctly the better for repairs. It was necessary to pick one\xe2\x80\x99s way\r\nas one went, and as the light was defective stumbles were not\r\ninfrequent.\r\n\r\nOur guide paused outside a door on the topmost landing. From some\r\nmysterious recess in her apparel she produced a key.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s in \xe2\x80\x99ere. I locked the door so that nothing mightn\xe2\x80\x99t be disturbed.\r\nI knows \xe2\x80\x99ow particular you pleesmen is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe turned the key. We all went in--we, this time, in front, and she\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nA candle was guttering on a broken and dilapidated single washhand\r\nstand. A small iron bedstead stood by its side, the clothes on which\r\nwere all tumbled and tossed. There was a rush-seated chair with a hole\r\nin the seat,--and that, with the exception of one or two chipped pieces\r\nof stoneware, and a small round mirror which was hung on a nail against\r\nthe wall, seemed to be all that the room contained. I could see nothing\r\nin the shape of a murdered man. Nor, it appeared, could the Inspector\r\neither.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the meaning of this, Mrs Henderson? I don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s be\xe2\x80\x99ind the bed, Mr Phillips. I left \xe2\x80\x99im just where I found \xe2\x80\x99im, I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99ave touched \xe2\x80\x99im not for nothing, nor yet \xe2\x80\x99ave let nobody else\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ave touched \xe2\x80\x99im neither, because, as I say, I know \xe2\x80\x99ow particular you\r\npleesmen is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe all four went hastily forward. Atherton and I went to the head of\r\nthe bed, Lessingham and the Inspector, leaning right across the bed,\r\npeeped over the side. There, on the floor in the space which was\r\nbetween the bed and the wall, lay the murdered man.\r\n\r\nAt sight of him an exclamation burst from Sydney\xe2\x80\x99s lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s Holt!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank God!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Lessingham. \xe2\x80\x98It isn\xe2\x80\x99t Marjorie!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe relief in his tone was unmistakable. That the one was gone was\r\nplainly nothing to him in comparison with the fact that the other was\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nThrusting the bed more into the centre of the room I knelt down beside\r\nthe man on the floor. A more deplorable spectacle than he presented I\r\nhave seldom witnessed. He was decently clad in a grey tweed suit, white\r\nhat, collar and necktie, and it was perhaps that fact which made his\r\nextreme attenuation the more conspicuous. I doubt if there was an ounce\r\nof flesh on the whole of his body. His cheeks and the sockets of his\r\neyes were hollow. The skin was drawn tightly over his cheek bones,--the\r\nbones themselves were staring through. Even his nose was wasted, so\r\nthat nothing but a ridge of cartilage remained. I put my arm beneath\r\nhis shoulder and raised him from the floor; no resistance was offered\r\nby the body\xe2\x80\x99s gravity,--he was as light as a little child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I doubt,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98if this man has been murdered. It looks to me like\r\na case of starvation, or exhaustion,--possibly a combination of both.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s that on his neck?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the Inspector,--he was kneeling at my\r\nside.\r\n\r\nHe referred to two abrasions of the skin,--one on either side of the\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They look to me like scratches. They seem pretty deep, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink they\xe2\x80\x99re sufficient in themselves to cause death.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They might be, joined to an already weakened constitution. Is there\r\nanything in his pockets?--let\xe2\x80\x99s lift him on to the bed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe lifted him on to the bed,--a featherweight he was to lift. While the\r\nInspector was examining his pockets--to find them empty--a tall man\r\nwith a big black beard came bustling in. He proved to be Dr Glossop,\r\nthe local police surgeon, who had been sent for before our quitting the\r\nStation House.\r\n\r\nHis first pronouncement, made as soon as he commenced his examination,\r\nwas, under the circumstances, sufficiently startling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the man\xe2\x80\x99s dead. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you send for me directly\r\nyou found him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe question was put to Mrs Henderson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Dr Glossop, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t touch \xe2\x80\x99im myself, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99ave \xe2\x80\x99im\r\ntouched by no one else, because, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said afore, I know \xe2\x80\x99ow\r\nparticular them pleesmen is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then in that case, if he does die you\xe2\x80\x99ll have had a hand in murdering\r\nhim,--that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe lady sniggered. \xe2\x80\x98Of course Dr Glossop, we all knows that you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nalways \xe2\x80\x99ave your joke.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll find it a joke if you have to hang, as you ought to, you----\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThe doctor said what he did say to himself, under his breath. I doubt\r\nif it was flattering to Mrs Henderson. \xe2\x80\x98Have you got any brandy in the\r\nhouse?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ve got everythink in the \xe2\x80\x99ouse for them as likes to pay for\r\nit,--everythink.\xe2\x80\x99 Then, suddenly remembering that the police were\r\npresent, and that hers were not exactly licensed premises, \xe2\x80\x98Leastways\r\nwe can send out for it for them parties as gives us the money, being,\r\nas is well known, always willing to oblige.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then send for some,--to the tap downstairs, if that\xe2\x80\x99s the nearest! If\r\nthis man dies before you\xe2\x80\x99ve brought it I\xe2\x80\x99ll have you locked up as sure\r\nas you\xe2\x80\x99re a living woman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the brandy was not long delayed,--but the man on the bed\r\nhad regained consciousness before it came. Opening his eyes he looked\r\nup at the doctor bending over him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo, my man! that\xe2\x80\x99s more like the time of day! How are you feeling?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe patient stared hazily up at the doctor, as if his sense of\r\nperception was not yet completely restored,--as if this big bearded man\r\nwas something altogether strange. Atherton bent down beside the doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to see you looking better, Mr Holt. You know me don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been running about after you all day long.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are--you are--\xe2\x80\x99 The man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes closed, as if the effort at\r\nrecollection exhausted him. He kept them closed as he continued to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know who you are. You are--the gentleman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s it, I\xe2\x80\x99m the gentleman,--name of Atherton.--Miss Lindon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriend. And I daresay you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling pretty well done up, and in want\r\nof something to eat and drink,--here\xe2\x80\x99s some brandy for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe doctor had some in a tumbler. He raised the patient\xe2\x80\x99s head,\r\nallowing it to trickle down his throat. The man swallowed it\r\nmechanically, motionless, as if unconscious what it was that he was\r\ndoing. His cheeks flushed, the passing glow of colour caused their\r\ncondition of extraordinary, and, indeed, extravagant attenuation, to\r\nbe more prominent than ever. The doctor laid him back upon the bed,\r\nfeeling his pulse with one hand, while he stood and regarded him in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nThen, turning to the Inspector, he said to him in an undertone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you want him to make a statement he\xe2\x80\x99ll have to make it now, he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoing fast. You won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to get much out of him,--he\xe2\x80\x99s too far\r\ngone, and I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bustle him, but get what you can.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Inspector came to the front, a notebook in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I understand from this gentleman--\xe2\x80\x99 signifying Atherton--\xe2\x80\x98that your\r\nname\xe2\x80\x99s Robert Holt. I\xe2\x80\x99m an Inspector of police, and I want you to tell\r\nme what has brought you into this condition. Has anyone been assaulting\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHolt, opening his eyes, glanced up at the speaker mistily, as if he\r\ncould not see him clearly,--still less understand what it was that he\r\nwas saying. Sydney, stooping over him, endeavoured to explain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Inspector wants to know how you got here, has anyone been doing\r\nanything to you? Has anyone been hurting you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe man\xe2\x80\x99s eyelids were partially closed. Then they opened wider and\r\nwider. His mouth opened too. On his skeleton features there came a look\r\nof panic fear. He was evidently struggling to speak. At last words came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The beetle!\xe2\x80\x99 He stopped. Then, after an effort, spoke again. \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nbeetle!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s he mean?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the Inspector.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think I understand,\xe2\x80\x99 Sydney answered; then turning again to the man\r\nin the bed. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, I hear what you say,--the beetle. Well, has the\r\nbeetle done anything to you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It took me by the throat!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that the meaning of the marks upon your neck?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The beetle killed me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe lids closed. The man relapsed into a state of lethargy. The\r\nInspector was puzzled;--and said so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s he mean about a beetle?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAtherton replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think I understand what he means,--and my friends do too. We\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nexplain afterwards. In the meantime I think I\xe2\x80\x99d better get as much out\r\nof him as I can,--while there\xe2\x80\x99s time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said the doctor, his hand upon the patient\xe2\x80\x99s pulse, \xe2\x80\x98while\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s time. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t much--only seconds.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSydney endeavoured to rouse the man from his stupor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ve been with Miss Lindon all the afternoon and evening, haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou, Mr Holt?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAtherton had reached a chord in the man\xe2\x80\x99s consciousness. His lips\r\nmoved,--in painful articulation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--all the afternoon--and evening--God help me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope God will help you my poor fellow; you\xe2\x80\x99ve been in need of His\r\nhelp if ever man was. Miss Lindon is disguised in your old clothes,\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,--in my old clothes. My God!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And where is Miss Lindon now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe man had been speaking with his eyes closed. Now he opened them,\r\nwide; there came into them the former staring horror. He became\r\npossessed by uncontrollable agitation,--half raising himself in bed.\r\nWords came from his quivering lips as if they were only drawn from him\r\nby the force of his anguish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The beetle\xe2\x80\x99s going to kill Miss Lindon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA momentary paroxysm seemed to shake the very foundations of his being.\r\nHis whole frame quivered. He fell back on to the bed,--ominously. The\r\ndoctor examined him in silence--while we too were still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This time he\xe2\x80\x99s gone for good, there\xe2\x80\x99ll be no conjuring him back again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI felt a sudden pressure on my arm, and found that Lessingham was\r\nclutching me with probably unconscious violence. The muscles of his\r\nface were twitching. He trembled. I turned to the doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Doctor, if there is any of that brandy left will you let me have it\r\nfor my friend?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLessingham disposed of the remainder of the \xe2\x80\x98shillings worth.\xe2\x80\x99 I rather\r\nfancy it saved us from a scene.\r\n\r\nThe Inspector was speaking to the woman of the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Mrs Henderson, perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll tell us what all this means. Who is\r\nthis man, and how did he come in here, and who came in with him, and\r\nwhat do you know about it altogether? If you\xe2\x80\x99ve got anything to say,\r\nsay it, only you\xe2\x80\x99d better be careful, because it\xe2\x80\x99s my duty to warn you\r\nthat anything you do say may be used against you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLV.\r\n ALL THAT MRS \xe2\x80\x99ENDERSON KNEW\r\n\r\nMrs Henderson put her hands under her apron and smirked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Mr Phillips, it do sound strange to \xe2\x80\x99ear you talkin\xe2\x80\x99 to me like\r\nthat. Anybody\xe2\x80\x99d think I\xe2\x80\x99d done something as I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ought to \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 done\r\nto \xe2\x80\x99ear you going on. As for what\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99appened, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you all I know\r\nwith the greatest willingness on earth. And as for bein\xe2\x80\x99 careful, there\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t no call for you to tell me to be that, for that I always am, as\r\nby now you ought to know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,--I do know. Is that all you have to say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rilly, Mr Phillips, what a man you are for catching people up, you\r\nrilly are. O\xe2\x80\x99 course that ain\xe2\x80\x99t all I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to say,--ain\xe2\x80\x99t I just\r\na-comin\xe2\x80\x99 to it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you presses me so you\xe2\x80\x99ll muddle of me up, and then if I do \xe2\x80\x99appen\r\nto make a herror, you\xe2\x80\x99ll say I\xe2\x80\x99m a liar, when goodness knows there\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t no more truthful woman not in Limehouse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWords plainly trembled on the Inspector\xe2\x80\x99s lips,--which he refrained\r\nfrom uttering. Mrs Henderson cast her eyes upwards, as if she sought\r\nfor inspiration from the filthy ceiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So far as I can swear it might \xe2\x80\x99ave been a hour ago, or it might \xe2\x80\x99ave\r\nbeen a hour and a quarter, or it might \xe2\x80\x99ave been a hour and twenty\r\nminutes--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99re not particular as to the seconds.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When I \xe2\x80\x99ears a knockin\xe2\x80\x99 at my front door, and when I comes to open it,\r\nthere was a Harab party, with a great bundle on \xe2\x80\x99is \xe2\x80\x99ead, bigger nor\r\n\xe2\x80\x99isself, and two other parties along with him. This Harab party says,\r\nin that queer foreign way them Harab parties \xe2\x80\x99as of talkin\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x9cA room\r\nfor the night, a room.\xe2\x80\x9d Now I don\xe2\x80\x99t much care for foreigners, and never\r\ndid, especially them Harabs, which their \xe2\x80\x99abits ain\xe2\x80\x99t my own,--so I as\r\nmuch \xe2\x80\x99ints the same. But this \xe2\x80\x99ere Harab party, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to quite\r\nfoller of my meaning, for all he done was to say as he said afore, \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nroom for the night, a room.\xe2\x80\x9d And he shoves a couple of \xe2\x80\x99arf crowns into\r\nmy \xe2\x80\x99and. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s always been a motter o\xe2\x80\x99 mine, that money is money,\r\nand one man\xe2\x80\x99s money is as good as another man\xe2\x80\x99s. So, not wishing to be\r\ndisagreeable--which other people would have taken \xe2\x80\x99em if I \xe2\x80\x99adn\xe2\x80\x99t, I\r\nshows \xe2\x80\x99em up \xe2\x80\x99ere. I\xe2\x80\x99d been downstairs it might \xe2\x80\x99ave been \xe2\x80\x99arf a hour,\r\nwhen I \xe2\x80\x99ears a shindy a-coming from this room--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What sort of a shindy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yelling and shrieking--oh my gracious, it was enough to set your blood\r\nall curdled,--for ear-piercingness I never did \xe2\x80\x99ear nothing like it. We\r\ndo \xe2\x80\x99ave troublesome parties in \xe2\x80\x99ere, like they do elsewhere, but I\r\nnever did \xe2\x80\x99ear nothing like that before. I stood it for about a minute,\r\nbut it kep\xe2\x80\x99 on, and kep\xe2\x80\x99 on, and every moment I expected as the other\r\nparties as was in the \xe2\x80\x99ouse would be complainin\xe2\x80\x99, so up I comes and I\r\nthumps at the door, and it seemed that thump I might for all the notice\r\nthat was took of me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did the noise keep on?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Keep on! I should think it did keep on! Lord love you! shriek after\r\nshriek, I expected to see the roof took off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Were there any other noises? For instance, were there any sounds of\r\nstruggling, or of blows?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There weren\xe2\x80\x99t no sounds except of the party hollering.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One party only?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One party only. As I says afore, shriek after shriek,--when you put\r\nyour ear to the panel there was a noise like some other party\r\nblubbering, but that weren\xe2\x80\x99t nothing, as for the hollering you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave thought that nothing what you might call \xe2\x80\x99umin could \xe2\x80\x99ave kep\xe2\x80\x99 up\r\nsuch a screechin\xe2\x80\x99. I thumps and thumps and at last when I did think\r\nthat I should \xe2\x80\x99ave to \xe2\x80\x99ave the door broke down, the Harab says to me\r\nfrom inside, \xe2\x80\x9cGo away! I pay for the room! go away!\xe2\x80\x9d I did think that\r\npretty good, I tell you that. So I says, \xe2\x80\x9cPay for the room or not pay\r\nfor the room, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay to make that shindy!\xe2\x80\x9d And what\xe2\x80\x99s more I\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I \xe2\x80\x99ear it again,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cout you goes! And if you don\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\nquiet I\xe2\x80\x99ll \xe2\x80\x99ave somebody in as\xe2\x80\x99ll pretty quickly make you!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then was there silence?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So to speak there was,--only there was this sound as if some party was\r\na-blubbering, and another sound as if a party was a-panting for his\r\nbreath.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then what happened?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Seeing that, so to speak, all was quiet, down I went again. And in\r\nanother quarter of a hour, or it might \xe2\x80\x99ave been twenty minutes, I went\r\nto the front door to get a mouthful of hair. And Mrs Barker, what lives\r\nover the road, at No. 24, she comes to me and says, \xe2\x80\x9cThat there Arab\r\nparty of yours didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop long.\xe2\x80\x9d I looks at \xe2\x80\x99er, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite foller\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d I says,--which I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw him come in,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthen, a few minutes back, I see \xe2\x80\x99im go again, with a great bundle on\r\n\xe2\x80\x99is \xe2\x80\x99ead he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99ardly stagger under!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s news\r\nto me, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know \xe2\x80\x99e\xe2\x80\x99d gone, nor see him neither--\xe2\x80\x9d which I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nSo, up I comes again, and, sure enough, the door was open, and it seems\r\nto me that the room was empty, till I come upon this poor young man\r\nwhat was lying be\xe2\x80\x99ind the bed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a growl from the doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you\xe2\x80\x99d had any sense, and sent for me at once, he might have been\r\nalive at this moment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Ow was I to know that, Dr Glossop? I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell. My finding \xe2\x80\x99im\r\nthere murdered was quite enough for me. So I runs downstairs, and I\r\nnips \xe2\x80\x99old of \xe2\x80\x99Gustus Barley, what was leaning against the wall, and I\r\nsays to him, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Gustus Barley, run to the station as fast as you can and\r\ntell \xe2\x80\x99em that a man\xe2\x80\x99s been murdered,--that Harab\xe2\x80\x99s been and killed a\r\nbloke.\xe2\x80\x9d And that\xe2\x80\x99s all I know about it, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you no\r\nmore, Mr Phillips, not if you was to keep on asking me questions not\r\nfor hours and hours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you think it was this man\xe2\x80\x99--with a motion towards the bed--\xe2\x80\x98who\r\nwas shrieking?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To tell you the truth, Mr Phillips, about that I don\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99ardly know\r\nwhat to think. If you \xe2\x80\x99ad asked me I should \xe2\x80\x99ave said it was a woman. I\r\nought to know a woman\xe2\x80\x99s holler when I \xe2\x80\x99ear it, if any one does, I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\n\xe2\x80\x99eard enough of \xe2\x80\x99em in my time, goodness knows. And I should \xe2\x80\x99ave said\r\nthat only a woman could \xe2\x80\x99ave hollered like that and only \xe2\x80\x99er when she\r\nwas raving mad. But there weren\xe2\x80\x99t no woman with him. There was only\r\nthis man what\xe2\x80\x99s murdered, and the other man,--and as for the other man\r\nI will say this, that \xe2\x80\x99e \xe2\x80\x99adn\xe2\x80\x99t got twopennyworth of clothes to cover\r\n\xe2\x80\x99im. But, Mr Phillips, howsomever that may be, that\xe2\x80\x99s the last Harab\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll \xe2\x80\x99ave under my roof, no matter what they pays, and you may mark my\r\nwords I\xe2\x80\x99ll \xe2\x80\x99ave no more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Henderson, once more glancing upward, as if she imagined herself to\r\nhave made some declaration of a religious nature, shook her head with\r\nmuch solemnity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLVI.\r\n THE SUDDEN STOPPING\r\n\r\nAs we were leaving the house a constable gave the Inspector a note.\r\nHaving read it he passed it to me. It was from the local office.\r\n\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Message received that an Arab with a big bundle on his head has been\r\n noticed loitering about the neighbourhood of St Pancras Station. He\r\n seemed to be accompanied by a young man who had the appearance of a\r\n tramp. Young man seemed ill. They appeared to be waiting for a train,\r\n probably to the North. Shall I advise detention?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nI scribbled on the flyleaf of the note.\r\n\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Have them detained. If they have gone by train have a special in\r\n readiness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a minute we were again in the cab. I endeavoured to persuade\r\nLessingham and Atherton to allow me to conduct the pursuit alone,--in\r\nvain. I had no fear of Atherton\xe2\x80\x99s succumbing, but I was afraid for\r\nLessingham. What was more almost than the expectation of his collapse\r\nwas the fact that his looks and manner, his whole bearing, so eloquent\r\nof the agony and agitation of his mind, was beginning to tell upon my\r\nnerves. A catastrophe of some sort I foresaw. Of the curtain\xe2\x80\x99s fall\r\nupon one tragedy we had just been witnesses. That there was worse--much\r\nworse, to follow I did not doubt. Optimistic anticipations were out of\r\nthe question,--that the creature we were chasing would relinquish the\r\nprey uninjured, no one, after what we had seen and heard, could by any\r\npossibility suppose. Should a necessity suddenly arise for prompt and\r\nimmediate action, that Lessingham would prove a hindrance rather than a\r\nhelp I felt persuaded.\r\n\r\nBut since moments were precious, and Lessingham was not to be persuaded\r\nto allow the matter to proceed without him, all that remained was to\r\nmake the best of his presence.\r\n\r\nThe great arch of St Pancras was in darkness. An occasional light\r\nseemed to make the darkness still more visible. The station seemed\r\ndeserted. I thought, at first, that there was not a soul about the\r\nplace, that our errand was in vain, that the only thing for us to do\r\nwas to drive to the police station and to pursue our inquiries there.\r\nBut as we turned towards the booking-office, our footsteps ringing out\r\nclearly through the silence and the night, a door opened, a light shone\r\nout from the room within, and a voice inquired:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My name\xe2\x80\x99s Champnell. Has a message been received from me from the\r\nLimehouse Police Station?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Step this way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe stepped that way,--into a snug enough office, of which one of the\r\nrailway inspectors was apparently in charge. He was a big man, with a\r\nfair beard. He looked me up and down, as if doubtfully. Lessingham he\r\nrecognised at once. He took off his cap to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Lessingham, I believe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am Mr Lessingham. Have you any news for me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI fancy, by his looks,--that the official was struck by the pallor of\r\nthe speaker\xe2\x80\x99s face,--and by his tremulous voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am instructed to give certain information to a Mr Augustus\r\nChampnell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am Mr Champnell. What\xe2\x80\x99s your information?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With reference to the Arab about whom you have been making inquiries.\r\nA foreigner, dressed like an Arab, with a great bundle on his head,\r\ntook two single thirds for Hull by the midnight express.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was he alone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is believed that he was accompanied by a young man of very\r\ndisreputable appearance. They were not together at the booking-office,\r\nbut they had been seen together previously. A minute or so after the\r\nArab had entered the train this young man got into the same\r\ncompartment--they were in the front waggon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why were they not detained?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We had no authority to detain them, nor any reason. Until your message\r\nwas received a few minutes ago we at this station were not aware that\r\ninquiries were being made for them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You say he booked to Hull,--does the train run through to Hull?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go to Hull at all. Part of it\xe2\x80\x99s the Liverpool and\r\nManchester Express, and part of it\xe2\x80\x99s for Carlisle. It divides at Derby.\r\nThe man you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for will change either at Sheffield or at\r\nCudworth Junction and go on to Hull by the first train in the morning.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a local service.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI looked at my watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You say the train left at midnight. It\xe2\x80\x99s now nearly five-and-twenty\r\npast. Where\xe2\x80\x99s it now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nearing St Albans, it\xe2\x80\x99s due there 12.35.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would there be time for a wire to reach St Albans?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hardly,--and anyhow there\xe2\x80\x99ll only be enough railway officials about\r\nthe place to receive and despatch the train. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be fully occupied\r\nwith their ordinary duties. There won\xe2\x80\x99t be time to get the police\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You could wire to St Albans to inquire if they were still in the\r\ntrain?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That could be done,--certainly. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have it done at once if you like.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then where\xe2\x80\x99s the next stoppage?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, they\xe2\x80\x99re at Luton at 12.51. But that\xe2\x80\x99s another case of St Albans.\r\nYou see there won\xe2\x80\x99t be much more than twenty minutes by the time you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot your wire off, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect there\xe2\x80\x99ll be many people awake at\r\nLuton. At these country places sometimes there\xe2\x80\x99s a policeman hanging\r\nabout the station to see the express go through, but, on the other\r\nhand, very often there isn\xe2\x80\x99t, and if there isn\xe2\x80\x99t, probably at this time\r\nof night it\xe2\x80\x99ll take a good bit of time to get the police on the\r\npremises. I tell you what I should advise.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The train is due at Bedford at 1.29--send your wire there. There ought\r\nto be plenty of people about at Bedford, and anyhow there\xe2\x80\x99ll be time to\r\nget the police to the station.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good. I instructed them to tell you to have a special\r\nready,--have you got one?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s an engine with steam up in the shed,--we\xe2\x80\x99ll have all ready for\r\nyou in less than ten minutes. And I tell you what,--you\xe2\x80\x99ll have about\r\nfifty minutes before the train is due at Bedford. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fifty mile\r\nrun. With luck you ought to get there pretty nearly as soon as the\r\nexpress does.--Shall I tell them to get ready?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At once.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhile he issued directions through a telephone to what, I presume, was\r\nthe engine shed, I drew up a couple of telegrams. Having completed his\r\norders he turned to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99re coming out of the siding now--they\xe2\x80\x99ll be ready in less than\r\nten minutes. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see that the line\xe2\x80\x99s kept clear. Have you got those\r\nwires?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here is one,--this is for Bedford.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt ran:\r\n\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Arrest the Arab who is in train due at 1.29. When leaving St Pancras\r\n he was in a third-class compartment in front waggon. He has a large\r\n bundle, which detain. He took two third singles for Hull. Also detain\r\n his companion, who is dressed like a tramp. This is a young lady whom\r\n the Arab has disguised and kidnapped while in a condition of hypnotic\r\n trance. Let her have medical assistance and be taken to a hotel. All\r\n expenses will be paid on the arrival of the undersigned who is\r\n following by special train. As the Arab will probably be very violent a\r\n sufficient force of police should be in waiting.\r\n\r\n                                            \xe2\x80\x98Augustus Champnell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And this is the other. It is probably too late to be of any use at St\r\nAlbans,--but send it there, and also to Luton.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Is Arab with companion in train which left St Pancras at 12.0? If so,\r\n do not let them get out till train reaches Bedford, where instructions\r\n are being wired for arrest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Inspector rapidly scanned them both.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They ought to do your business, I should think. Come along with\r\nme--I\xe2\x80\x99ll have them sent at once, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if your train\xe2\x80\x99s ready.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe train was not ready,--nor was it ready within the prescribed ten\r\nminutes. There was some hitch, I fancy, about a saloon. Finally we had\r\nto be content with an ordinary old-fashioned first-class carriage. The\r\ndelay, however, was not altogether time lost. Just as the engine with\r\nits solitary coach was approaching the platform someone came running up\r\nwith an envelope in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Telegram from St Albans.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI tore it open. It was brief and to the point.\r\n\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Arab with companion was in train when it left here. Am wiring Luton.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Now unless something wholly unforeseen takes place,\r\nwe ought to have them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat unforeseen!\r\n\r\nI went forward with the Inspector and the guard of our train to\r\nexchange a few final words with the driver. The Inspector explained\r\nwhat instructions he had given.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve told the driver not to spare his coal but to take you into\r\nBedford within five minutes after the arrival of the express. He says\r\nhe thinks that he can do it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe driver leaned over his engine, rubbing his hands with the usual\r\noily rag. He was a short, wiry man with grey hair and a grizzled\r\nmoustache, with about him that bearing of semi-humorous, frank-faced\r\nresolution which one notes about engine-drivers as a class.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We ought to do it, the gradients are against us, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a clear\r\nnight and there\xe2\x80\x99s no wind. The only thing that will stop us will be if\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s any shunting on the road, or any luggage trains; of course, if\r\nwe are blocked, we are blocked, but the Inspector says he\xe2\x80\x99ll clear the\r\nway for us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Inspector, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll clear the way. I\xe2\x80\x99ve wired down the\r\nroad already.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAtherton broke in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Driver, if you get us into Bedford within five minutes of the arrival\r\nof the mail there\xe2\x80\x99ll be a five-pound note to divide between your mate\r\nand you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe driver grinned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll get you there in time, sir, if we have to go clear through the\r\nshunters. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t often we get a chance of a five-pound note for a run\r\nto Bedford, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll do our best to earn it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe fireman waved his hand in the rear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s right, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried. \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to trouble you for that\r\nfive-pound note.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo soon as we were clear of the station it began to seem probable that,\r\nas the fireman put it, Atherton would be \xe2\x80\x98troubled.\xe2\x80\x99 Journeying in a\r\ntrain which consists of a single carriage attached to an engine which\r\nis flying at topmost speed is a very different business from being an\r\noccupant of an ordinary train which is travelling at ordinary express\r\nrates. I had discovered that for myself before. That night it was\r\nimpressed on me more than ever. A tyro--or even a nervous\r\n\xe2\x80\x98season\xe2\x80\x99--might have been excused for expecting at every moment we were\r\ngoing to be derailed. It was hard to believe that the carriage had any\r\nsprings,--it rocked and swung, and jogged and jolted. Of smooth\r\ntravelling had we none. Talking was out of the question;--and for that,\r\nI, personally, was grateful. Quite apart from the difficulty we\r\nexperienced in keeping our seats--and when every moment our position\r\nwas being altered and we were jerked backwards and forwards up and\r\ndown, this way and that, that was a business which required care,--the\r\nnoise was deafening. It was as though we were being pursued by a legion\r\nof shrieking, bellowing, raging demons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98George!\xe2\x80\x99 shrieked Atherton, \xe2\x80\x98he does mean to earn that fiver. I hope\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll be alive to pay it him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was only at the other end of the carriage, but though I could see by\r\nthe distortion of his visage that he was shouting at the top of his\r\nvoice,--and he has a voice,--I only caught here and there a word or two\r\nof what he was saying. I had to make sense of the whole.\r\n\r\nLessingham\xe2\x80\x99s contortions were a study. Few of that large multitude of\r\npersons who are acquainted with him only by means of the portraits\r\nwhich have appeared in the illustrated papers, would then have\r\nrecognised the rising statesman. Yet I believe that few things could\r\nhave better fallen in with his mood than that wild travelling. He might\r\nhave been almost shaken to pieces,--but the very severity of the\r\nshaking served to divert his thoughts from the one dread topic which\r\nthreatened to absorb them to the exclusion of all else beside. Then\r\nthere was the tonic influence of the element of risk. The pick-me-up\r\neffect of a spice of peril. Actual danger there quite probably was\r\nnone; but there very really seemed to be. And one thing was absolutely\r\ncertain, that if we did come to smash while going at that speed we\r\nshould come to as everlasting smash as the heart of man could by any\r\npossibility desire. It is probable that the knowledge that this was so\r\nwarmed the blood in Lessingham\xe2\x80\x99s veins. At any rate as--to use what in\r\nthis case, was simply a form of speech--I sat and watched him, it\r\nseemed to me that he was getting a firmer hold of the strength which\r\nhad all but escaped him, and that with every jog and jolt he was\r\nbecoming more and more of a man.\r\n\r\nOn and on we went dashing, crashing, smashing, roaring, rumbling.\r\nAtherton, who had been endeavouring to peer through the window,\r\nstrained his lungs again in the effort to make himself audible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where the devil are we?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLooking at my watch I screamed back at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s nearly one, so I suppose we\xe2\x80\x99re somewhere in the neighbourhood of\r\nLuton.--Hollo! What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat something was the matter seemed certain. There was a shrill\r\nwhistle from the engine. In a second we were conscious--almost too\r\nconscious--of the application of the Westinghouse brake. Of all the\r\njolting that was ever jolted! the mere reverberation of the carriage\r\nthreatened to resolve our bodies into their component parts. Feeling\r\nwhat we felt then helped us to realise the retardatory force which that\r\nvacuum brake must be exerting,--it did not seem at all surprising that\r\nthe train should have been brought to an almost instant standstill.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously all three of us were on our feet. I let down my window\r\nand Atherton let down his,--he shouting out,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should think that Inspector\xe2\x80\x99s wire hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had it\xe2\x80\x99s proper effect,\r\nlooks as if we\xe2\x80\x99re blocked--or else we\xe2\x80\x99ve stopped at Luton. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nBedford.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Bedford--so much seemed clear. Though at first from my window\r\nI could make out nothing. I was feeling more than a trifle\r\ndazed,--there was a singing in my ears,--the sudden darkness was\r\nimpenetrable. Then I became conscious that the guard was opening the\r\ndoor of his compartment. He stood on the step for a moment, seeming to\r\nhesitate. Then, with a lamp in his hand, he descended on to the line.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t know, sir. Seems as if there was something on the road. What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nup there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis was to the man on the engine. The fireman replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Someone in front there\xe2\x80\x99s waving a red light like mad,--lucky I caught\r\nsight of him, we should have been clean on top of him in another\r\nmoment. Looks as if there was something wrong. Here he comes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs my eyes grew more accustomed to the darkness I became aware that\r\nsomeone was making what haste he could along the six-foot way, swinging\r\na red light as he came. Our guard advanced to meet him, shouting as he\r\nwent:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter! Who\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA voice replied,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My God! Is that George Hewett. I thought you were coming right on top\r\nof us!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOur guard again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What! Jim Branson! What the devil are you doing here, what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong? I\r\nthought you were on the twelve out, we\xe2\x80\x99re chasing you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you? Then you\xe2\x80\x99ve caught us. Thank God for it!--We\xe2\x80\x99re a wreck.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI had already opened the carriage door. With that we all three\r\nclambered out on to the line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLVII.\r\n THE CONTENTS OF THE THIRD-CLASS CARRIAGE\r\n\r\nI moved to the stranger who was holding the lamp. He was in official\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you the guard of the 12.0 out from St Pancras?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s your train? What\xe2\x80\x99s happened?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As for where it is, there it is, right in front of you, what\xe2\x80\x99s left of\r\nit. As to what\xe2\x80\x99s happened, why, we\xe2\x80\x99re wrecked.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean by you\xe2\x80\x99re wrecked?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Some heavy loaded trucks broke loose from a goods in front and came\r\nrunning down the hill on top of us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How long ago was it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not ten minutes. I was just starting off down the road to the signal\r\nbox, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good two miles away, when I saw you coming. My God! I\r\nthought there was going to be another smash.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Much damage done?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Seems to me as if we\xe2\x80\x99re all smashed up. As far as I can make out\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re matchboxed up in front. I feel as if I was all broken up inside\r\nof me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the service going on for thirty years, and this is\r\nthe first accident I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was too dark to see the man\xe2\x80\x99s face, but judging from his tone he was\r\neither crying or very near to it.\r\n\r\nOur guard turned and shouted back to our engine,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99d better go back to the box and let \xe2\x80\x99em know!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right!\xe2\x80\x99 came echoing back.\r\n\r\nThe special immediately commenced retreating, whistling continually as\r\nit went. All the country side must have heard the engine shrieking, and\r\nall who did hear must have understood that on the line something was\r\nseriously wrong.\r\n\r\nThe smashed train was all in darkness, the force of the collision had\r\nput out all the carriage lamps. Here was a flickering candle, there the\r\nglimmer of a match, these were all the lights which shone upon the\r\nscene. People were piling up d\xc3\xa9bris by the side of the line, for the\r\npurpose of making a fire,--more for illumination than for warmth.\r\n\r\nMany of the passengers had succeeded in freeing themselves, and were\r\nmoving hither and thither about the line. But the majority appeared to\r\nbe still imprisoned. The carriage doors were jammed. Without the\r\nnecessary tools it was impossible to open them. Every step we took our\r\nears were saluted by piteous cries. Men, women, children, appealed to\r\nus for help.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Open the door, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98In the name of God, sir, open the door!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOver and over again, in all sorts of tones, with all degrees of\r\nviolence, the supplication was repeated.\r\n\r\nThe guards vainly endeavoured to appease the, in many cases,\r\nhalf-frenzied creatures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right, sir! If you\xe2\x80\x99ll only wait a minute or two, madam! We can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget the doors open without tools, a special train\xe2\x80\x99s just started off to\r\nget them. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll only have patience there\xe2\x80\x99ll be plenty of help for\r\neveryone of you directly. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be quite safe in there, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll only\r\nkeep still.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut that was just what they found it most difficult to do--keep still!\r\n\r\nIn the front of the train all was chaos. The trucks which had done the\r\nmischief--there were afterwards shown to be six of them, together with\r\ntwo guards\xe2\x80\x99 vans--appeared to have been laden with bags of Portland\r\ncement. The bags had burst, and everything was covered with what seemed\r\ngritty dust. The air was full of the stuff, it got into our eyes, half\r\nblinding us. The engine of the express had turned a complete\r\nsomersault. It vomited forth smoke, and steam, and flames,--every\r\nmoment it seemed as if the woodwork of the carriages immediately behind\r\nand beneath would catch fire.\r\n\r\nThe front coaches were, as the guard had put it, \xe2\x80\x98matchboxed.\xe2\x80\x99 They\r\nwere nothing but a heap of d\xc3\xa9bris,--telescoped into one another in a\r\nstate of apparently inextricable confusion. It was broad daylight\r\nbefore access was gained to what had once been the interiors. The\r\ncondition of the first third-class compartment revealed an\r\nextraordinary state of things.\r\n\r\nScattered all over it were pieces of what looked like partially burnt\r\nrags, and fragments of silk and linen. I have those fragments now.\r\nExperts have assured me that they are actually neither of silk nor\r\nlinen! but of some material--animal rather than vegetable--with which\r\nthey are wholly unacquainted. On the cushions and woodwork--especially\r\non the woodwork of the floor--were huge blotches,--stains of some sort.\r\nWhen first noticed they were damp, and gave out a most unpleasant\r\nsmell. One of the pieces of woodwork is yet in my possession,--with the\r\nstain still on it. Experts have pronounced upon it too,--with the\r\nresult that opinions are divided. Some maintain that the stain was\r\nproduced by human blood, which had been subjected to a great heat, and,\r\nso to speak, parboiled. Others declare that it is the blood of some\r\nwild animal,--possibly of some creature of the cat species. Yet others\r\naffirm that it is not blood at all, but merely paint. While a fourth\r\ndescribes it as--I quote the written opinion which lies in front of\r\nme--\xe2\x80\x98caused apparently by a deposit of some sort of viscid matter,\r\nprobably the excretion of some variety of lizard.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn a corner of the carriage was the body of what seemed a young man\r\ncostumed like a tramp. It was Marjorie Lindon.\r\n\r\nSo far as a most careful search revealed, that was all the compartment\r\ncontained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n THE CONCLUSION OF THE MATTER\r\n\r\nIt is several years since I bore my part in the events which I have\r\nrapidly sketched,--or I should not have felt justified in giving them\r\npublicity. Exactly how many years, for reasons which should be\r\nsufficiently obvious, I must decline to say.\r\n\r\nMarjorie Lindon still lives. The spark of life which was left in her,\r\nwhen she was extricated from among the d\xc3\xa9bris of the wrecked express,\r\nwas fanned again into flame. Her restoration was, however, not merely\r\nan affair of weeks or months, it was a matter of years. I believe that,\r\neven after her physical powers were completely restored--in itself a\r\ntedious task--she was for something like three years under medical\r\nsupervision as a lunatic. But all that skill and money could do was\r\ndone, and in course of time--the great healer--the results were\r\nentirely satisfactory.\r\n\r\nHer father is dead,--and has left her in possession of the family\r\nestates. She is married to the individual who, in these pages, has been\r\nknown as Paul Lessingham. Were his real name divulged she would be\r\nrecognised as the popular and universally reverenced wife of one of the\r\ngreatest statesmen the age has seen.\r\n\r\nNothing has been said to her about the fateful day on which she\r\nwas--consciously or unconsciously--paraded through London in the\r\ntattered masculine habiliments of a vagabond. She herself has never\r\nonce alluded to it. With the return of reason the affair seems to have\r\npassed from her memory as wholly as if it had never been, which,\r\nalthough she may not know it, is not the least cause she has for\r\nthankfulness. Therefore what actually transpired will never, in all\r\nhuman probability, be certainly known and particularly what precisely\r\noccurred in the railway carriage during that dreadful moment of sudden\r\npassing from life unto death. What became of the creature who all but\r\ndid her to death; who he was--if it was a \xe2\x80\x98he,\xe2\x80\x99 which is extremely\r\ndoubtful; whence he came; whither he went; what was the purport of his\r\npresence here,--to this hour these things are puzzles.\r\n\r\nPaul Lessingham has not since been troubled by his old tormentor. He\r\nhas ceased to be a haunted man. None the less he continues to have what\r\nseems to be a constitutional disrelish for the subject of beetles, nor\r\ncan he himself be induced to speak of them. Should they be mentioned in\r\na general conversation, should he be unable to immediately bring about\r\na change of theme, he will, if possible, get up and leave the room.\r\nMore, on this point he and his wife are one.\r\n\r\nThe fact may not be generally known, but it is so. Also I have reason\r\nto believe that there still are moments in which he harks back, with\r\nsomething like physical shrinking, to that awful nightmare of the past,\r\nand in which he prays God, that as it is distant from him now so may it\r\nbe kept far off from him for ever.\r\n\r\nBefore closing, one matter may be casually mentioned. The tale has\r\nnever been told, but I have unimpeachable authority for its\r\nauthenticity.\r\n\r\nDuring the recent expeditionary advance towards Dongola, a body of\r\nnative troops which was encamped at a remote spot in the desert was\r\naroused one night by what seemed to be the sound of a loud explosion.\r\nThe next morning, at a distance of about a couple of miles from the\r\ncamp, a huge hole was discovered in the ground,--as if blasting\r\noperations, on an enormous scale, had recently been carried on. In the\r\nhole itself, and round about it, were found fragments of what seemed\r\nbodies; credible witnesses have assured me that they were bodies\r\nneither of men nor women, but of creatures of some monstrous growth. I\r\nprefer to believe, since no scientific examination of the remains took\r\nplace, that these witnesses ignorantly, though innocently, erred.\r\n\r\nOne thing is sure. Numerous pieces, both of stone and of metal, were\r\nseen, which went far to suggest that some curious subterranean building\r\nhad been blown up by the force of the explosion. Especially were there\r\nportions of moulded metal which seemed to belong to what must have been\r\nan immense bronze statue. There were picked up also, more than a dozen\r\nreplicas in bronze of the whilom sacred scarabaeus.\r\n\r\nThat the den of demons described by Paul Lessingham, had, that night,\r\nat last come to an end, and that these things which lay scattered, here\r\nand there, on that treeless plain, were the evidences of its final\r\ndestruction, is not a hypothesis which I should care to advance with\r\nany degree of certainty. But, putting this and that together, the facts\r\nseem to point that way,--and it is a consummation devoutly to be\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nBy-the-bye, Sydney Atherton has married Miss Dora Grayling. Her wealth\r\nhas made him one of the richest men in England. She began, the story\r\ngoes, by loving him immensely; I can answer for the fact that he has\r\nended by loving her as much. Their devotion to each other contradicts\r\nthe pessimistic nonsense which supposes that every marriage must be of\r\nnecessity a failure. He continues his career of an inventor. His\r\ninvestigations into the subject of a\xc3\xabrial flight, which have brought\r\nthe flying machine within the range of practical politics, are on\r\neverybody\xe2\x80\x99s tongue.\r\n\r\nThe best man at Atherton\xe2\x80\x99s wedding was Percy Woodville, now the Earl of\r\nBarnes. Within six months afterwards he married one of Mrs Atherton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbridesmaids.\r\n\r\nIt was never certainly shown how Robert Holt came to his end. At the\r\ninquest the coroner\xe2\x80\x99s jury was content to return a verdict of \xe2\x80\x98Died of\r\nexhaustion.\xe2\x80\x99 He lies buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, under a handsome\r\ntombstone, the cost of which, had he had it in his pockets, might have\r\nindefinitely prolonged his days.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned that that portion of this strange history which\r\npurports to be The Surprising Narration of Robert Holt was compiled\r\nfrom the statements which Holt made to Atherton, and to Miss Lindon, as\r\nshe then was, when, a mud-stained, shattered derelict he lay at the\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s father\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\nMiss Lindon\xe2\x80\x99s contribution towards the elucidation of the mystery was\r\nwritten with her own hand. After her physical strength had come back to\r\nher, and, while mentally, she still hovered between the darkness and\r\nthe light, her one relaxation was writing. Although she would never\r\nspeak of what she had written, it was found that her theme was always\r\nthe same. She confided to pen and paper what she would not speak of\r\nwith her lips. She told, and re-told, and re-told again, the story of\r\nher love, and of her tribulation so far as it is contained in the\r\npresent volume. Her MSS. invariably began and ended at the same point.\r\nThey have all of them been destroyed, with one exception. That\r\nexception is herein placed before the reader.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the Mystery of the Beetle I do not propose to\r\npronounce a confident opinion. Atherton and I have talked it over many\r\nand many a time, and at the end we have got no \xe2\x80\x98forrarder.\xe2\x80\x99 So far as I\r\nam personally concerned, experience has taught me that there are indeed\r\nmore things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our philosophy,\r\nand I am quite prepared to believe that the so-called Beetle, which\r\nothers saw, but I never, was--or is, for it cannot be certainly shown\r\nthat the Thing is not still existing--a creature born neither of God\r\nnor man.\r\n\r\n THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n TRANSCRIBER\xe2\x80\x99S NOTES\r\n\r\nAlterations to the text:\r\n\r\nReformat TOC.\r\n\r\nChange several instances of _anyrate_ to _any rate_ and _Sidney_ to\r\n_Sydney_.\r\n\r\nMinor punctuation corrections.\r\n\r\nNote: minor spelling and hyphenization inconsistencies (e.g.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbedclothes\xe2\x80\x9d/\xe2\x80\x9cbed-clothes\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cpigeon-hole\xe2\x80\x9d/\xe2\x80\x9cpigeon hole\xe2\x80\x9d, etc.) have\r\nbeen preserved.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
