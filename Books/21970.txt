The forest on either side\r\nswelled up the slopes of the embankment and crested across it in a green\r\nwave of trees and bushes. The trail was as narrow as a man's body, and\r\nwas no more than a wild-animal runway. Occasionally, a piece of rusty\r\niron, showing through the forest-mould, advertised that the rail and the\r\nties still remained. In one place, a ten-inch tree, bursting through at\r\na connection, had lifted the end of a rail clearly into view. The tie\r\nhad evidently followed the rail, held to it by the spike long enough\r\nfor its bed to be filled with gravel and rotten leaves, so that now the\r\ncrumbling, rotten timber thrust itself up at a curious slant. Old as the\r\nroad was, it was manifest that it had been of the mono-rail type.\r\n\r\nAn old man and a boy travelled along this runway. They moved slowly, for\r\nthe old man was very old, a touch of palsy made his movements tremulous,\r\nand he leaned heavily upon his staff. A rude skull-cap of goat-skin\r\nprotected his head from the sun. From beneath this fell a scant fringe\r\nof stained and dirty-white hair. A visor, ingeniously made from a large\r\nleaf, shielded his eyes, and from under this he peered at the way of\r\nhis feet on the trail. His beard, which should have been snow-white\r\nbut which showed the same weather-wear and camp-stain as his hair,\r\nfell nearly to his waist in a great tangled mass. About his chest and\r\nshoulders hung a single, mangy garment of goat-skin. His arms and legs,\r\nwithered and skinny, betokened extreme age, as well as did their sunburn\r\nand scars and scratches betoken long years of exposure to the elements.\r\n\r\nThe boy, who led the way, checking the eagerness of his muscles to\r\nthe slow progress of the elder, likewise wore a single garment--a\r\nragged-edged piece of bear-skin, with a hole in the middle through which\r\nhe had thrust his head. He could not have been more than twelve years\r\nold. Tucked coquettishly over one ear was the freshly severed tail of a\r\npig. In one hand he carried a medium-sized bow and an arrow.\r\n\r\nOn his back was a quiverful of arrows. From a sheath hanging about his\r\nneck on a thong, projected the battered handle of a hunting knife. He\r\nwas as brown as a berry, and walked softly, with almost a catlike tread.\r\nIn marked contrast with his sunburned skin were his eyes--blue, deep\r\nblue, but keen and sharp as a pair of gimlets. They seemed to bore into\r\naft about him in a way that was habitual. As he went along he smelled\r\nthings, as well, his distended, quivering nostrils carrying to his brain\r\nan endless series of messages from the outside world. Also, his hearing\r\nwas acute, and had been so trained that it operated automatically.\r\nWithout conscious effort, he heard all the slight sounds in the apparent\r\nquiet--heard, and differentiated, and classified these sounds--whether\r\nthey were of the wind rustling the leaves, of the humming of bees and\r\ngnats, of the distant rumble of the sea that drifted to him only in\r\nlulls, or of the gopher, just under his foot, shoving a pouchful of\r\nearth into the entrance of his hole.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he became alertly tense. Sound, sight, and odor had given him\r\na simultaneous warning. His hand went back to the old man, touching\r\nhim, and the pair stood still. Ahead, at one side of the top of the\r\nembankment, arose a crackling sound, and the boy's gaze was fixed on the\r\ntops of the agitated bushes. Then a large bear, a grizzly, crashed into\r\nview, and likewise stopped abruptly, at sight of the humans. He did not\r\nlike them, and growled querulously. Slowly the boy fitted the arrow to\r\nthe bow, and slowly he pulled the bowstring taut. But he never removed\r\nhis eyes from the bear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Slowly he pulled the bowstring taut 020]\r\n\r\nThe old man peered from under his green leaf at the danger, and stood as\r\nquietly as the boy. For a few seconds this mutual scrutinizing went\r\non; then, the bear betraying a growing irritability, the boy, with a\r\nmovement of his head, indicated that the old man must step aside from\r\nthe trail and go down the embankment. The boy followed, going backward,\r\nstill holding the bow taut and ready. They waited till a crashing among\r\nthe bushes from the opposite side of the embankment told them the bear\r\nhad gone on. The boy grinned as he led back to the trail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA big un, Granser,\xe2\x80\x9d he chuckled.\r\n\r\nThe old man shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey get thicker every day,\xe2\x80\x9d he complained in a thin, undependable\r\nfalsetto. \xe2\x80\x9cWho'd have thought I'd live to see the time when a man would\r\nbe afraid of his life on the way to the Cliff House. When I was a boy,\r\nEdwin, men and women and little babies used to come out here from San\r\nFrancisco by tens of thousands on a nice day. And there weren't any\r\nbears then. No, sir. They used to pay money to look at them in cages,\r\nthey were that rare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is money, Granser?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore the old man could answer, the boy recollected and triumphantly\r\nshoved his hand into a pouch under his bear-skin and pulled forth a\r\nbattered and tarnished silver dollar. The old man's eyes glistened, as\r\nhe held the coin close to them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can't see,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou look and see if you can make out the\r\ndate, Edwin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou're a great Granser,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried delightedly, \xe2\x80\x9calways making believe\r\nthem little marks mean something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man manifested an accustomed chagrin as he brought the coin back\r\nagain close to his own eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c2012,\xe2\x80\x9d he shrilled, and then fell to cackling grotesquely. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was\r\nthe year Morgan the Fifth was appointed President of the United States\r\nby the Board of Magnates. It must have been one of the last coins\r\nminted, for the Scarlet Death came in 2013. Lord! Lord!--think of it!\r\nSixty years ago, and I am the only person alive to-day that lived in\r\nthose times. Where did you find it, Edwin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy, who had been regarding him with the tolerant curiousness one\r\naccords to the prattlings of the feeble-minded, answered promptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got it off of Hoo-Hoo. He found it when we was herdin' goats down\r\nnear San Jos\xc3\xa9 last spring. Hoo-Hoo said it was _money_. Ain't you\r\nhungry, Granser?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ancient caught his staff in a tighter grip and urged along the\r\ntrail, his old eyes shining greedily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope Hare-Lip 's found a crab... or two,\xe2\x80\x9d he mumbled. \xe2\x80\x9cThey're good\r\neating, crabs, mighty good eating when you've no more teeth and you've\r\ngot grandsons that love their old grandsire and make a point of catching\r\ncrabs for him. When I was a boy--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Edwin, suddenly stopped by what he saw, was drawing the bowstring\r\non a fitted arrow. He had paused on the brink of a crevasse in the\r\nembankment. An ancient culvert had here washed out, and the stream, no\r\nlonger confined, had cut a passage through the fill. On the opposite\r\nside, the end of a rail projected and overhung. It showed rustily\r\nthrough the creeping vines which overran it. Beyond, crouching by a\r\nbush, a rabbit looked across at him in trembling hesitancy. Fully fifty\r\nfeet was the distance, but the arrow flashed true; and the transfixed\r\nrabbit, crying out in sudden fright and hurt, struggled painfully away\r\ninto the brush. The boy himself was a flash of brown skin and flying fur\r\nas he bounded down the steep wall of the gap and up the other side.\r\nHis lean muscles were springs of steel that released into graceful\r\nand efficient action. A hundred feet beyond, in a tangle of bushes,\r\nhe overtook the wounded creature, knocked its head on a convenient\r\ntree-trunk, and turned it over to Granser to carry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rabbit is good, very good 026]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRabbit is good, very good,\xe2\x80\x9d the ancient quavered, \xe2\x80\x9cbut when it comes to\r\na toothsome delicacy I prefer crab. When I was a boy--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you say so much that ain't got no sense?\xe2\x80\x9d Edwin impatiently\r\ninterrupted the other's threatened garrulousness.\r\n\r\nThe boy did not exactly utter these words, but something that remotely\r\nresembled them and that was more guttural and explosive and economical\r\nof qualifying phrases. His speech showed distant kinship with that of\r\nthe old man, and the latter's speech was approximately an English that\r\nhad gone through a bath of corrupt usage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I want to know,\xe2\x80\x9d Edwin continued, \xe2\x80\x9cis why you call crab 'toothsome\r\ndelicacy'? Crab is crab, ain't it? No one I never heard calls it such\r\nfunny things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man sighed but did not answer, and they moved on in silence.\r\nThe surf grew suddenly louder, as they emerged from the forest upon a\r\nstretch of sand dunes bordering the sea. A few goats were browsing among\r\nthe sandy hillocks, and a skin-clad boy, aided by a wolfish-looking\r\ndog that was only faintly reminiscent of a collie, was watching them.\r\nMingled with the roar of the surf was a continuous, deep-throated\r\nbarking or bellowing, which came from a cluster of jagged rocks a\r\nhundred yards out from shore. Here huge sea-lions hauled themselves\r\nup to lie in the sun or battle with one another. In the immediate\r\nforeground arose the smoke of a fire, tended by a third savage-looking\r\nboy. Crouched near him were several wolfish dogs similar to the one that\r\nguarded the goats.\r\n\r\nThe old man accelerated his pace, sniffing eagerly as he neared the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMussels!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered ecstatically. \xe2\x80\x9cMussels! And ain't that a crab,\r\nHoo-Hoo? Ain't that a crab? My, my, you boys are good to your old\r\ngrandsire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHoo-Hoo, who was apparently of the same age as Edwin, grinned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll you want, Granser. I got four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man's palsied eagerness was pitiful. Sitting down in the sand as\r\nquickly as his stiff limbs would let him, he poked a large rock-mussel\r\nfrom out of the coals. The heat had forced its shells apart, and\r\nthe meat, salmon-colored, was thoroughly cooked. Between thumb and\r\nforefinger, in trembling haste, he caught the morsel and carried it\r\nto his mouth. But it was too hot, and the next moment was violently\r\nejected. The old man spluttered with the pain, and tears ran out of his\r\neyes and down his cheeks.\r\n\r\nThe boys were true savages, possessing only the cruel humor of the\r\nsavage. To them the incident was excruciatingly funny, and they burst\r\ninto loud laughter. Hoo-Hoo danced up and down, while Edwin rolled\r\ngleefully on the ground. The boy with the goats came running to join in\r\nthe fun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSet 'em to cool, Edwin, set 'em to cool,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man besought, in the\r\nmidst of his grief, making no attempt to wipe away the tears that\r\nstill flowed from his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd cool a crab, Edwin, too. You know your\r\ngrandsire likes crabs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom the coals arose a great sizzling, which proceeded from the many\r\nmussels bursting open their shells and exuding their moisture. They were\r\nlarge shellfish, running from three to six inches in length. The boys\r\nraked them out with sticks and placed them on a large piece of driftwood\r\nto cool.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was a boy, we did not laugh at our elders; we respected them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boys took no notice, and Granser continued to babble an incoherent\r\nflow of complaint and censure. But this time he was more careful, and\r\ndid not burn his mouth. All began to eat, using nothing but their hands\r\nand making loud mouth-noises and lip-smackings. The third boy, who was\r\ncalled Hare-Lip, slyly deposited a pinch of sand on a mussel the ancient\r\nwas carrying to his mouth; and when the grit of it bit into the old\r\nfellow's mucous membrane and gums, the laughter was again uproarious. He\r\nwas unaware that a joke had been played on him, and spluttered and spat\r\nuntil Edwin, relenting, gave him a gourd of fresh water with which to\r\nwash out his mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere's them crabs, Hoo-Hoo?\xe2\x80\x9d Edwin demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cGranser's set upon\r\nhaving a snack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Granser's eyes burned with greediness as a large crab was handed\r\nto him. It was a shell with legs and all complete, but the meat had long\r\nsince departed. With shaky fingers and babblings of anticipation, the\r\nold man broke off a leg and found it filled with emptiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe crabs, Hoo-Hoo?\xe2\x80\x9d he wailed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe crabs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was fooling Granser. They ain't no crabs! I never found one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boys were overwhelmed with delight at sight of the tears of senile\r\ndisappointment that dribbled down the old man's cheeks. Then, unnoticed,\r\nHoo-Hoo replaced the empty shell with a fresh-cooked crab. Already\r\ndismembered, from the cracked legs the white meat sent forth a small\r\ncloud of savory steam. This attracted the old man's nostrils, and he\r\nlooked down in amazement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This attracted the old man's nostrils 033]\r\n\r\nThe change of his mood to one of joy was immediate. He snuffled and\r\nmuttered and mumbled, making almost a croon of delight, as he began\r\nto eat. Of this the boys took little notice, for it was an accustomed\r\nspectacle. Nor did they notice his occasional exclamations and\r\nutterances of phrases which meant nothing to them, as, for instance,\r\nwhen he smacked his lips and champed his gums while muttering:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMayonnaise! Just think--mayonnaise! And it's sixty years since the last\r\nwas ever made! Two generations and never a smell of it! Why, in those\r\ndays it was served in every restaurant with crab.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he could eat no more, the old man sighed, wiped his hands on his\r\nnaked legs, and gazed out over the sea. With the content of a full\r\nstomach, he waxed reminiscent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo think of it! I've seen this beach alive with men, women, and\r\nchildren on a pleasant Sunday. And there weren't any bears to eat them\r\nup, either. And right up there on the cliff was a big restaurant where\r\nyou could get anything you wanted to eat. Four million people lived in\r\nSan Francisco then. And now, in the whole city and county there aren't\r\nforty all told. And out there on the sea were ships and ships always to\r\nbe seen, going in for the Golden Gate or coming out. And airships in the\r\nair--dirigibles and flying machines. They could travel two hundred miles\r\nan hour. The mail contracts with the New York and San Francisco Limited\r\ndemanded that for the minimum. There was a chap, a Frenchman, I forget\r\nhis name, who succeeded in making three hundred; but the thing was\r\nrisky, too risky for conservative persons. But he was on the right clew,\r\nand he would have managed it if it hadn't been for the Great Plague.\r\nWhen I was a boy, there were men alive who remembered the coming of the\r\nfirst aeroplanes, and now I have lived to see the last of them, and that\r\nsixty years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man babbled on, unheeded by the boys, who were long accustomed\r\nto his garrulousness, and whose vocabularies, besides, lacked the\r\ngreater portion of the words he used. It was noticeable that in these\r\nrambling soliloquies his English seemed to recrudesce into better\r\nconstruction and phraseology. But when he talked directly with the boys\r\nit lapsed, largely, into their own uncouth and simpler forms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there weren't many crabs in those days,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man wandered on.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were fished out, and they were great delicacies. The open season\r\nwas only a month long, too. And now crabs are accessible the whole year\r\naround. Think of it--catching all the crabs you want, any time you want,\r\nin the surf of the Cliff House beach!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sudden commotion among the goats brought the boys to their feet. The\r\ndogs about the fire rushed to join their snarling fellow who guarded the\r\ngoats, while the goats themselves stampeded in the direction of their\r\nhuman protectors. A half dozen forms, lean and gray, glided about on the\r\nsand hillocks and faced the bristling dogs. Edwin arched an arrow that\r\nfell short. But Hare-Lip, with a sling such as David carried into battle\r\nagainst Goliath, hurled a stone through the air that whistled from the\r\nspeed of its flight. It fell squarely among the wolves and caused them\r\nto slink away toward the dark depths of the eucalyptus forest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: With a sling such as David carried 036]\r\n\r\nThe boys laughed and lay down again in the sand, while Granser sighed\r\nponderously. He had eaten too much, and, with hands clasped on his\r\npaunch, the fingers interlaced, he resumed his maunderings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'The fleeting systems lapse like foam,'\xe2\x80\x9d he mumbled what was evidently\r\na quotation. \xe2\x80\x9cThat's it--foam, and fleeting. All man's toil upon the\r\nplanet was just so much foam. He domesticated the serviceable animals,\r\ndestroyed the hostile ones, and cleared the land of its wild vegetation.\r\nAnd then he passed, and the flood of primordial life rolled back again,\r\nsweeping his handiwork away--the weeds and the forest inundated his\r\nfields, the beasts of prey swept over his flocks, and now there are\r\nwolves on the Cliff House beach.\xe2\x80\x9d He was appalled by the thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\r\nfour million people disported themselves, the wild wolves roam to-day,\r\nand the savage progeny of our loins, with prehistoric weapons, defend\r\nthemselves against the fanged despoilers. Think of it! And all because\r\nof the Scarlet Death--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe adjective had caught Hare-Lip's ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe's always saying that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Edwin. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is _scarlet?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'The scarlet of the maples can shake me like the cry of bugles going\r\nby,'\xe2\x80\x9d the old man quoted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's red,\xe2\x80\x9d Edwin answered the question. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you don't know it because\r\nyou come from the Chauffeur Tribe. They never did know nothing, none of\r\nthem. Scarlet is red--I know that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRed is red, ain't it?\xe2\x80\x9d Hare-Lip grumbled. \xe2\x80\x9cThen what's the good of\r\ngettin' cocky and calling it scarlet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGranser, what for do you always say so much what nobody knows?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked. \xe2\x80\x9cScarlet ain't anything, but red is red. Why don't you say red,\r\nthen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRed is not the right word,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply. \xe2\x80\x9cThe plague was scarlet.\r\nThe whole face and body turned scarlet in an hour's time. Don't I\r\nknow? Didn't I see enough of it? And I am telling you it was scarlet\r\nbecause--well, because it _was_ scarlet. There is no other word for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRed is good enough for me,\xe2\x80\x9d Hare-Lip muttered obstinately. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dad\r\ncalls red red, and he ought to know. He says everybody died of the Red\r\nDeath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour dad is a common fellow, descended from a common fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d Granser\r\nretorted heatedly. \xe2\x80\x9cDon't I know the beginnings of the Chauffeurs? Your\r\ngrandsire was a chauffeur, a servant, and without education. He worked\r\nfor other persons. But your grandmother was of good stock, only the\r\nchildren did not take after her. Don't I remember when I first met them,\r\ncatching fish at Lake Temescal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is _education?_\xe2\x80\x9d Edwin asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCalling red scarlet,\xe2\x80\x9d Hare-Lip sneered, then returned to the attack on\r\nGranser. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dad told me, an' he got it from his dad afore he croaked,\r\nthat your wife was a Santa Rosan, an' that she was sure no account. He\r\nsaid she was a _hash-slinger_ before the Red Death, though I don't know\r\nwhat a _hash-slinger_ is. You can tell me, Edwin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Edwin shook his head in token of ignorance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true, she was a waitress,\xe2\x80\x9d Granser acknowledged. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she was a\r\ngood woman, and your mother was her daughter. Women were very scarce in\r\nthe days after the Plague. She was the only wife I could find, even if\r\nshe was a _hash-slinger_, as your father calls it. But it is not nice to\r\ntalk about our progenitors that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDad says that the wife of the first Chauffeur was a _lady_--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's a _lady?_\xe2\x80\x9d Hoo-Hoo demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA _lady_ 's a Chauffeur squaw,\xe2\x80\x9d was the quick reply of Hare-Lip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first Chauffeur was Bill, a common fellow, as I said before,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nold man expounded; \xe2\x80\x9cbut his wife was a lady, a great lady. Before the\r\nScarlet Death she was the wife of Van Worden. He was President of the\r\nBoard of Industrial Magnates, and was one of the dozen men who\r\nruled America. He was worth one billion, eight hundred millions of\r\ndollars--coins like you have there in your pouch, Edwin. And then came\r\nthe Scarlet Death, and his wife became the wife of Bill, the first\r\nChauffeur. He used to beat her, too. I have seen it myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHoo-Hoo, lying on his stomach and idly digging his toes in the sand,\r\ncried out and investigated, first, his toe-nail, and next, the small\r\nhole he had dug. The other two boys joined him, excavating the sand\r\nrapidly with their hands till there lay three skeletons exposed. Two\r\nwere of adults, the third being that of a part-grown child. The old man\r\ntrudged along on the ground and peered at the find.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlague victims,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced. \xe2\x80\x9cThat's the way they died everywhere\r\nin the last days. This must have been a family, running away from the\r\ncontagion and perishing here on the Cliff House beach. They--what are\r\nyou doing, Edwin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis question was asked in sudden dismay, as Edwin, using the back of\r\nhis hunting knife, began to knock out the teeth from the jaws of one of\r\nthe skulls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing to string 'em,\xe2\x80\x9d was the response.\r\n\r\nThe three boys were now hard at it; and quite a knocking and hammering\r\narose, in which Granser babbled on unnoticed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are true savages. Already has begun the custom of wearing human\r\nteeth. In another generation you will be perforating your noses and\r\nears and wearing ornaments of bone and shell. I know. The human race\r\nis doomed to sink back farther and farther into the primitive night\r\nere again it begins its bloody climb upward to civilization. When we\r\nincrease and feel the lack of room, we will proceed to kill one another.\r\nAnd then I suppose you will wear human scalp-locks at your waist, as\r\nwell--as you, Edwin, who are the gentlest of my grandsons, have already\r\nbegun with that vile pigtail. Throw it away, Edwin, boy; throw it away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a gabble the old geezer makes,\xe2\x80\x9d Hare-Lip remarked, when, the teeth\r\nall extracted, they began an attempt at equal division.\r\n\r\nThey were very quick and abrupt in their actions, and their speech, in\r\nmoments of hot discussion over the allotment of the choicer teeth, was\r\ntruly a gabble. They spoke in monosyllables and short jerky sentences\r\nthat was more a gibberish than a language. And yet, through it ran hints\r\nof grammatical construction, and appeared vestiges of the conjugation\r\nof some superior culture. Even the speech of Granser was so corrupt that\r\nwere it put down literally it would be almost so much nonsense to the\r\nreader. This, however, was when he talked with the boys.\r\n\r\nWhen he got into the full swing of babbling to himself, it slowly purged\r\nitself into pure English. The sentences grew longer and were enunciated\r\nwith a rhythm and ease that was reminiscent of the lecture platform.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell us about the Red Death, Granser,\xe2\x80\x9d Hare-Lip demanded, when the\r\nteeth affair had been satisfactorily concluded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Scarlet Death,\xe2\x80\x9d Edwin corrected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn' don't work all that funny lingo on us,\xe2\x80\x9d Hare-Lip went on. \xe2\x80\x9cTalk\r\nsensible, Granser, like a Santa Rosan ought to talk. Other Santa Rosans\r\ndon't talk like you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE old man showed pleasure in being thus called upon. He cleared his\r\nthroat and began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty or thirty years ago my story was in great demand. But in these\r\ndays nobody seems interested--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you go!\xe2\x80\x9d Hare-Lip cried hotly. \xe2\x80\x9cCut out the funny stuff and talk\r\nsensible. What's _interested?_ You talk like a baby that don't know\r\nhow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him alone,\xe2\x80\x9d Edwin urged, \xe2\x80\x9cor he'll get mad and won't talk at all.\r\nSkip the funny places. We'll catch on to some of what he tells us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet her go, Granser,\xe2\x80\x9d Hoo-Hoo encouraged; for the old man was already\r\nmaundering about the disrespect for elders and the reversion to cruelty\r\nof all humans that fell from high culture to primitive conditions.\r\n\r\nThe tale began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were very many people in the world in those days. San Francisco\r\nalone held four millions--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is millions?\xe2\x80\x9d Edwin interrupted.\r\n\r\nGranser looked at him kindly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you cannot count beyond ten, so I will tell you. Hold up your\r\ntwo hands. On both of them you have altogether ten fingers and thumbs.\r\nVery well. I now take this grain of sand--you hold it, Hoo-Hoo.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\ndropped the grain of sand into the lad's palm and went on. \xe2\x80\x9cNow that\r\ngrain of sand stands for the ten fingers of Edwin. I add another grain.\r\nThat's ten more fingers. And I add another, and another, and another,\r\nuntil I have added as many grains as Edwin has fingers and thumbs. That\r\nmakes what I call one hundred. Remember that word--one hundred. Now I\r\nput this pebble in Hare-Lip's hand. It stands for ten grains of sand, or\r\nten tens of fingers, or one hundred fingers. I put in ten pebbles. They\r\nstand for a thousand fingers. I take a mussel-shell, and it stands for\r\nten pebbles, or one hundred grains of sand, or one thousand fingers....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n And so on, laboriously, and with much reiteration, he strove to build\r\nup in their minds a crude conception of numbers. As the quantities\r\nincreased, he had the boys holding different magnitudes in each of\r\ntheir hands. For still higher sums, he laid the symbols on the log of\r\ndriftwood; and for symbols he was hard put, being compelled to use the\r\nteeth from the skulls for millions, and the crab-shells for billions.\r\nIt was here that he stopped, for the boys were showing signs of becoming\r\ntired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were four million people in San Francisco--four teeth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boys' eyes ranged along from the teeth and from hand to hand, down\r\nthrough the pebbles and sand-grains to Edwin's fingers. And back again\r\nthey ranged along the ascending series in the effort to grasp such\r\ninconceivable numbers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was a lot of folks, Granser,\xe2\x80\x9d Edwin at last hazarded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike sand on the beach here, like sand on the beach, each grain of sand\r\na man, or woman, or child. Yes, my boy, all those people lived right\r\nhere in San Francisco. And at one time or another all those people\r\ncame out on this very beach--more people than there are grains of sand.\r\nMore--more--more. And San Francisco was a noble city. And across the\r\nbay--where we camped last year, even more people lived, clear from Point\r\nRichmond, on the level ground and on the hills, all the way around to\r\nSan Leandro--one great city of seven million people.--Seven teeth...\r\nthere, that's it, seven millions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain the boys' eyes ranged up and down from Edwin's fingers to the\r\nteeth on the log.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe world was full of people. The census of 2010 gave eight billions\r\nfor the whole world--eight crab-shells, yes, eight billions. It was not\r\nlike to-day. Mankind knew a great deal more about getting food. And the\r\nmore food there was, the more people there were. In the year 1800, there\r\nwere one hundred and seventy millions in Europe alone. One hundred years\r\nlater--a grain of sand, Hoo-Hoo--one hundred years later, at 1900, there\r\nwere five hundred millions in Europe--five grains of sand, Hoo-Hoo, and\r\nthis one tooth. This shows how easy was the getting of food, and how men\r\nincreased. And in the year 2000 there were fifteen hundred millions\r\nin Europe. And it was the same all over the rest of the world. Eight\r\ncrab-shells there, yes, eight billion people were alive on the earth\r\nwhen the Scarlet Death began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was a young man when the Plague came--twenty-seven years old; and I\r\nlived on the other side of San Francisco Bay, in Berkeley. You remember\r\nthose great stone houses, Edwin, when we came down the hills from Contra\r\nCosta? That was where I lived, in those stone houses. I was a professor\r\nof English literature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I was a professor of English literature 054]\r\n\r\nMuch of this was over the heads of the boys, but they strove to\r\ncomprehend dimly this tale of the past.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was them stone houses for?\xe2\x80\x9d Hare-Lip queried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember when your dad taught you to swim?\xe2\x80\x9d The boy nodded.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, in the University of California--that is the name we had for\r\nthe houses--we taught young men and women how to think, just as I have\r\ntaught you now, by sand and pebbles and shells, to know how many people\r\nlived in those days. There was very much to teach. The young men and\r\nwomen we taught were called students. We had large rooms in which we\r\ntaught. I talked to them, forty or fifty at a time, just as I am talking\r\nto you now. I told them about the books other men had written before\r\ntheir time, and even, sometimes, in their time--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas that all you did?--just talk, talk, talk?\xe2\x80\x9d Hoo-Hoo demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\r\nhunted your meat for you? and milked the goats? and caught the fish?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sensible question, Hoo-Hoo, a sensible question. As I have told you,\r\nin those days food-getting was easy. We were very wise. A few men got\r\nthe food for many men. The other men did other things. As you say, I\r\ntalked. I talked all the time, and for this food was given me--much\r\nfood, fine food, beautiful food, food that I have not tasted in sixty\r\nyears and shall never taste again. I sometimes think the most wonderful\r\nachievement of our tremendous civilization was food--its inconceivable\r\nabundance, its infinite variety, its marvellous delicacy. O my\r\ngrandsons, life was life in those days, when we had such wonderful\r\nthings to eat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was beyond the boys, and they let it slip by, words and thoughts,\r\nas a mere senile wandering in the narrative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur food-getters were called _freemen_. This was a joke. We of the\r\nruling classes owned all the land, all the machines, everything. These\r\nfood-getters were our slaves. We took almost all the food they got, and\r\nleft them a little so that they might eat, and work, and get us more\r\nfood--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'd have gone into the forest and got food for myself,\xe2\x80\x9d Hare-Lip\r\nannounced; \xe2\x80\x9cand if any man tried to take it away from me, I'd have\r\nkilled him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I not tell you that we of the ruling class owned all the land, all\r\nthe forest, everything? Any food-getter who would not get food for us,\r\nhim we punished or compelled to starve to death. And very few did that.\r\nThey preferred to get food for us, and make clothes for us, and prepare\r\nand administer to us a thousand--a mussel-shell, Hoo-Hoo--a thousand\r\nsatisfactions and delights. And I was Professor Smith in those\r\ndays--Professor James Howard Smith. And my lecture courses were very\r\npopular--that is, very many of the young men and women liked to hear me\r\ntalk about the books other men had written.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I was very happy, and I had beautiful things to eat. And my hands\r\nwere soft, because I did no work with them, and my body was clean\r\nall over and dressed in the softest garments--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe surveyed his mangy goat-skin with disgust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe did not wear such things in those days. Even the slaves had better\r\ngarments. And we were most clean. We washed our faces and hands often\r\nevery day. You boys never wash unless you fall into the water or go\r\nswimming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither do you Granzer,\xe2\x80\x9d Hoo-Hoo retorted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, I know, I am a filthy old man, but times have changed. Nobody\r\nwashes these days, there are no conveniences. It is sixty years since I\r\nhave seen a piece of soap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sixty years since I have seen a piece of soap. 059]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not know what soap is, and I shall not tell you, for I am telling\r\nthe story of the Scarlet Death. You know what sickness is. We called\r\nit a disease. Very many of the diseases came from what we called germs.\r\nRemember that word--germs. A germ is a very small thing. It is like a\r\nwoodtick, such as you find on the dogs in the spring of the year when\r\nthey run in the forest. Only the germ is very small. It is so small that\r\nyou cannot see it--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHoo-Hoo began to laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou're a queer un, Granser, talking about things you can't see. If you\r\ncan't see 'em, how do you know they are? That's what I want to know. How\r\ndo you know anything you can't see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good question, a very good question, Hoo-Hoo. But we did see--some of\r\nthem. We had what we called microscopes and ultramicroscopes, and we put\r\nthem to our eyes and looked through them, so that we saw things larger\r\nthan they really were, and many things we could not see without the\r\nmicroscopes at all. Our best ultramicroscopes could make a germ look\r\nforty thousand times larger. A mussel-shell is a thousand fingers like\r\nEdwin's. Take forty mussel-shells, and by as many times larger was the\r\ngerm when we looked at it through a microscope. And after that, we\r\nhad other ways, by using what we called moving pictures, of making the\r\nforty-thousand-times germ many, many thousand times larger still. And\r\nthus we saw all these things which our eyes of themselves could not see.\r\nTake a grain of sand. Break it into ten pieces. Take one piece and break\r\nit into ten. Break one of those pieces into ten, and one of those into\r\nten, and one of those into ten, and one of those into ten, and do it all\r\nday, and maybe, by sunset, you will have a piece as small as one of the\r\ngerms.\xe2\x80\x9d The boys were openly incredulous. Hare-Lip sniffed and sneered\r\nand Hoo-Hoo snickered, until Edwin nudged them to be silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe woodtick sucks the blood of the dog, but the germ, being so very\r\nsmall, goes right into the blood of the body, and there it has\r\nmany children. In those days there would be as many as a billion--a\r\ncrab-shell, please--as many as that crab-shell in one man's body. We\r\ncalled germs micro-organisms. When a few million, or a billion, of them\r\nwere in a man, in all the blood of a man, he was sick. These germs were\r\na disease. There were many different kinds of them--more different kinds\r\nthan there are grains of sand on this beach. We knew only a few of the\r\nkinds. The micro-organic world was an invisible world, a world we could\r\nnot see, and we knew very little about it. Yet we did know something.\r\nThere was the _bacillus anthracis_; there was the _micrococcus_; there\r\nwas the _Bacterium termo_, and the _Bacterium lactis_--that's what\r\nturns the goat milk sour even to this day, Hare-Lip; and there were\r\n_Schizomycetes_ without end. And there were many others....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the old man launched into a disquisition on germs and their\r\nnatures, using words and phrases of such extraordinary length and\r\nmeaninglessness, that the boys grinned at one another and looked out\r\nover the deserted ocean till they forgot the old man was babbling on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the Scarlet Death, Granser,\xe2\x80\x9d Edwin at last suggested.\r\n\r\nGranser recollected himself, and with a start tore himself away from the\r\nrostrum of the lecture-hall, where, to another world audience, he\r\nhad been expounding the latest theory, sixty years gone, of germs and\r\ngerm-diseases.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, Edwin; I had forgotten. Sometimes the memory of the past is\r\nvery strong upon me, and I forget that I am a dirty old man, clad in\r\ngoat-skin, wandering with my savage grandsons who are goatherds in\r\nthe primeval wilderness. 'The fleeting systems lapse like foam,' and so\r\nlapsed our glorious, colossal civilization. I am Granser, a tired old\r\nman. I belong to the tribe of Santa Rosans. I married into that tribe.\r\nMy sons and daughters married into the Chauffeurs, the Sacramen-tos, and\r\nthe Palo-Altos. You, Hare-Lip, are of the Chauffeurs. You, Edwin, are\r\nof the Sacramentos. And you, Hoo-Hoo, are of the Palo-Altos. Your tribe\r\ntakes its name from a town that was near the seat of another great\r\ninstitution of learning. It was called Stanford University. Yes, I\r\nremember now. It is perfectly clear. I was telling you of the Scarlet\r\nDeath. Where was I in my story?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou was telling about germs, the things you can't see but which make\r\nmen sick,\xe2\x80\x9d Edwin prompted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that's where I was. A man did not notice at first when only a few\r\nof these germs got into his body. But each germ broke in half and became\r\ntwo germs, and they kept doing this very rapidly so that in a short time\r\nthere were many millions of them in the body. Then the man was sick. He\r\nhad a disease, and the disease was named after the kind of a germ that\r\nwas in him. It might be measles, it might be influenza, it might be\r\nyellow fever; it might be any of thousands and thousands of kinds of\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow this is the strange thing about these germs. There were always new\r\nones coming to live in men's bodies. Long and long and long ago, when\r\nthere were only a few men in the world, there were few diseases. But\r\nas men increased and lived closely together in great cities and\r\ncivilizations, new diseases arose, new kinds of germs entered their\r\nbodies. Thus were countless millions and billions of human beings\r\nkilled. And the more thickly men packed together, the more terrible were\r\nthe new diseases that came to be. Long before my time, in the middle\r\nages, there was the Black Plague that swept across Europe. It swept\r\nacross Europe many times. There was tuberculosis, that entered into men\r\nwherever they were thickly packed. A hundred years before my time there\r\nwas the bubonic plague. And in Africa was the sleeping sickness. The\r\nbacteriologists fought all these sicknesses and destroyed them, just as\r\nyou boys fight the wolves away from your goats, or squash the mosquitoes\r\nthat light on you. The bacteriologists--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Granser, what is a what-you-call-it?\xe2\x80\x9d Edwin interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, Edwin, are a goatherd. Your task is to watch the goats. You know a\r\ngreat deal about goats. A bacteriologist watches germs. That's his\r\ntask, and he knows a great deal about them. So, as I was saying, the\r\nbacteriologists fought with the germs and destroyed them--sometimes.\r\nThere was leprosy, a horrible disease. A hundred years before I was\r\nborn, the bacteriologists discovered the germ of leprosy. They knew all\r\nabout it. They made pictures of it. I have seen those pictures. But\r\nthey never found a way to kill it. But in 1984, there was the Pantoblast\r\nPlague, a disease that broke out in a country called Brazil and that\r\nkilled millions of people. But the bacteriologists found it out, and\r\nfound the way to kill it, so that the Pantoblast Plague went no farther.\r\nThey made what they called a serum, which they put into a man's body and\r\nwhich killed the pantoblast germs without killing the man. And in 1910,\r\nthere was Pellagra, and also the hookworm. These were easily killed\r\nby the bacteriologists. But in 1947 there arose a new disease that had\r\nnever been seen before. It got into the bodies of babies of only ten\r\nmonths old or less, and it made them unable to move their hands and\r\nfeet, or to eat, or anything; and the bacteriologists were eleven years\r\nin discovering how to kill that particular germ and save the babies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn spite of all these diseases, and of all the new ones that continued\r\nto arise, there were more and more men in the world. This was because it\r\nwas easy to get food. The easier it was to get food, the more men\r\nthere were; the more men there were, the more thickly were they packed\r\ntogether on the earth; and the more thickly they were packed, the more\r\nnew kinds of germs became diseases. There were warnings. Soldervetzsky,\r\nas early as 1929, told the bacteriologists that they had no guaranty\r\nagainst some new disease, a thousand times more deadly than any they\r\nknew, arising and killing by the hundreds of millions and even by the\r\nbillion. You see, the micro-organic world remained a mystery to the end.\r\nThey knew there was such a world, and that from time to time armies of\r\nnew germs emerged from it to kill men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that was all they knew about it. For all they knew, in that\r\ninvisible micro-organic world there might be as many different kinds of\r\ngerms as there are grains of sand on this beach. And also, in that same\r\ninvisible world it might well be that new kinds of germs came to be.\r\nIt might be there that life originated--the 'abysmal fecundity,'\r\nSoldervetzsky called it, applying the words of other men who had written\r\nbefore him....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was at this point that Hare-Lip rose to his feet, an expression of\r\nhuge contempt on his face.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Granser, you make me sick with your gabble 071]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGranser,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced, \xe2\x80\x9cyou make me sick with your gabble. Why don't\r\nyou tell about the Red Death? If you ain't going to, say so, an' we'll\r\nstart back for camp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man looked at him and silently began to cry. The weak tears of\r\nage rolled down his cheeks and all the feebleness of his eighty-seven\r\nyears showed in his grief-stricken countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down,\xe2\x80\x9d Edwin counselled soothingly. \xe2\x80\x9cGranser's all right. He's just\r\ngettin' to the Scarlet Death, ain't you, Granser? He's just goin' to\r\ntell us about it right now. Sit down, Hare-Lip. Go ahead, Granser.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE old man wiped the tears away on his grimy knuckles and took up the\r\ntale in a tremulous, piping voice that soon strengthened as he got the\r\nswing of the narrative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was in the summer of 2013 that the Plague came. I was twenty-seven\r\nyears old, and well do I remember it. Wireless despatches--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHare-Lip spat loudly his disgust, and Granser hastened to make amends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe talked through the air in those days, thousands and thousands of\r\nmiles. And the word came of a strange disease that had broken out in\r\nNew York. There were seventeen millions of people living then in that\r\nnoblest city of America. Nobody thought anything about the news. It was\r\nonly a small thing. There had been only a few deaths. It seemed, though,\r\nthat they had died very quickly, and that one of the first signs of\r\nthe disease was the turning red of the face and all the body. Within\r\ntwenty-four hours came the report of the first case in Chicago. And on\r\nthe same day, it was made public that London, the greatest city in the\r\nworld, next to Chicago, had been secretly fighting the plague for two\r\nweeks and censoring the news despatches--that is, not permitting the\r\nword to go forth to the rest of the world that London had the plague.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looked serious, but we in California, like everywhere else, were\r\nnot alarmed. We were sure that the bacteriologists would find a way to\r\novercome this new germ, just as they had overcome other germs in the\r\npast. But the trouble was the astonishing quickness with which this germ\r\ndestroyed human beings, and the fact that it inevitably killed any\r\nhuman body it entered. No one ever recovered. There was the old Asiatic\r\ncholera, when you might eat dinner with a well man in the evening, and\r\nthe next morning, if you got up early enough, you would see him being\r\nhauled by your window in the death-cart. But this new plague was quicker\r\nthan that--much quicker.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: But this new plague was quicker 078]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the moment of the first signs of it, a man would be dead in an\r\nhour. Some lasted for several hours. Many died within ten or fifteen\r\nminutes of the appearance of the first signs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe heart began to beat faster and the heat of the body to increase.\r\nThen came the scarlet rash, spreading like wildfire over the face and\r\nbody. Most persons never noticed the increase in heat and heart-beat,\r\nand the first they knew was when the scarlet rash came out. Usually,\r\nthey had convulsions at the time of the appearance of the rash. But\r\nthese convulsions did not last long and were not very severe. If one\r\nlived through them, he became perfectly quiet, and only did he feel a\r\nnumbness swiftly creeping up his body from the feet. The heels became\r\nnumb first, then the legs, and hips, and when the numbness reached\r\nas high as his heart he died. They did not rave or sleep. Their minds\r\nalways remained cool and calm up to the moment their heart numbed and\r\nstopped. And another strange thing was the rapidity of decomposition. No\r\nsooner was a person dead than the body seemed to fall to pieces, to\r\nfly apart, to melt away even as you looked at it. That was one of the\r\nreasons the plague spread so rapidly. All the billions of germs in a\r\ncorpse were so immediately released.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it was because of all this that the bacteriologists had so little\r\nchance in fighting the germs. They were killed in their laboratories\r\neven as they studied the germ of the Scarlet Death. They were heroes.\r\nAs fast as they perished, others stepped forth and took their places.\r\nIt was in London that they first isolated it. The news was telegraphed\r\neverywhere. Trask was the name of the man who succeeded in this, but\r\nwithin thirty hours he was dead. Then came the struggle in all the\r\nlaboratories to find something that would kill the plague germs. All\r\ndrugs failed. You see, the problem was to get a drug, or serum, that\r\nwould kill the germs in the body and not kill the body. They tried to\r\nfight it with other germs, to put into the body of a sick man germs that\r\nwere the enemies of the plague germs--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you can't see these germ-things, Granser,\xe2\x80\x9d Hare-Lip objected, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nhere you gabble, gabble, gabble about them as if they was anything,\r\nwhen they're nothing at all. Anything you can't see, ain't, that's what.\r\nFighting things that ain't with things that ain't! They must have\r\nbeen all fools in them days. That's why they croaked. I ain't goin' to\r\nbelieve in such rot, I tell you that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGranser promptly began to weep, while Edwin hotly took up his defence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Hare-Lip, you believe in lots of things you can't see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHare-Lip shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou believe in dead men walking about. You never seen one dead man walk\r\nabout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you I seen 'em, last winter, when I was wolf-hunting with dad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you always spit when you cross running water,\xe2\x80\x9d Edwin challenged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's to keep off bad luck,\xe2\x80\x9d was Hare-Lip's defence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou believe in bad luck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn' you ain't never seen bad luck,\xe2\x80\x9d Edwin concluded triumphantly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou're just as bad as Granser and his germs. You believe in what you\r\ndon't see. Go on, Granser.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHare-Lip, crushed by this metaphysical defeat, remained silent, and\r\nthe old man went on. Often and often, though this narrative must not be\r\nclogged by the details, was Granser's tale interrupted while the boys\r\nsquabbled among themselves. Also, among themselves they kept up a\r\nconstant, low-voiced exchange of explanation and conjecture, as they\r\nstrove to follow the old man into his unknown and vanished world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Scarlet Death broke out in San Francisco. The first death came on\r\na Monday morning. By Thursday they were dying like flies in Oakland\r\nand San Francisco. They died everywhere--in their beds, at their\r\nwork, walking along the street. It was on Tuesday that I saw my first\r\ndeath--Miss Collbran, one of my students, sitting right there before my\r\neyes, in my lecture-room. I noticed her face while I was talking. It had\r\nsuddenly turned scarlet. I ceased speaking and could only look at her,\r\nfor the first fear of the plague was already on all of us and we knew\r\nthat it had come. The young women screamed and ran out of the room. So\r\ndid the young men run out, all but two. Miss Collbran's convulsions were\r\nvery mild and lasted less than a minute. One of the young men fetched\r\nher a glass of water. She drank only a little of it, and cried out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'My feet! All sensation has left them.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter a minute she said, 'I have no feet. I am unaware that I have any\r\nfeet. And my knees are cold. I can scarcely feel that I have knees.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe lay on the floor, a bundle of notebooks under her head. And we\r\ncould do nothing. The coldness and the numbness crept up past her hips\r\nto her heart, and when it reached her heart she was dead. In fifteen\r\nminutes, by the clock--I timed it--she was dead, there, in my own\r\nclassroom, dead. And she was a very beautiful, strong, healthy young\r\nwoman. And from the first sign of the plague to her death only fifteen\r\nminutes elapsed. That will show you how swift was the Scarlet Death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet in those few minutes I remained with the dying woman in my\r\nclassroom, the alarm had spread over the university; and the students,\r\nby thousands, all of them, had deserted the lecture-room and\r\nlaboratories. When I emerged, on my way to make report to the President\r\nof the Faculty, I found the university deserted. Across the campus were\r\nseveral stragglers hurrying for their homes. Two of them were running.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPresident Hoag, I found in his office, all alone, looking very old and\r\nvery gray, with a multitude of wrinkles in his face that I had never\r\nseen before. At the sight of me, he pulled himself to his feet and\r\ntottered away to the inner office, banging the door after him and\r\nlocking it. You see, he knew I had been exposed, and he was afraid.\r\nHe shouted to me through the door to go away. I shall never forget\r\nmy feelings as I walked down the silent corridors and out across that\r\ndeserted campus. I was not afraid. I had been exposed, and I looked\r\nupon myself as already dead. It was not that, but a feeling of awful\r\ndepression that impressed me. Everything had stopped. It was like the\r\nend of the world to me--my world. I had been born within sight and sound\r\nof the university. It had been my predestined career. My father had been\r\na professor there before me, and his father before him. For a century\r\nand a half had this university, like a splendid machine, been running\r\nsteadily on. And now, in an instant, it had stopped. It was like seeing\r\nthe sacred flame die down on some thrice-sacred altar. I was shocked,\r\nunutterably shocked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I arrived home, my housekeeper screamed as I entered, and fled\r\naway. And when I rang, I found the housemaid had likewise fled. I\r\ninvestigated. In the kitchen I found the cook on the point of departure.\r\nBut she screamed, too, and in her haste dropped a suitcase of her\r\npersonal belongings and ran out of the house and across the grounds,\r\nstill screaming. I can hear her scream to this day. You see, we did not\r\nact in this way when ordinary diseases smote us. We were always calm\r\nover such things, and sent for the doctors and nurses who knew just\r\nwhat to do. But this was different. It struck so suddenly, and killed so\r\nswiftly, and never missed a stroke. When the scarlet rash appeared on a\r\nperson's face, that person was marked by death. There was never a known\r\ncase of a recovery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was alone in my big house. As I have told you often before, in those\r\ndays we could talk with one another over wires or through the air. The\r\ntelephone bell rang, and I found my brother talking to me. He told me\r\nthat he was not coming home for fear of catching the plague from me, and\r\nthat he had taken our two sisters to stop at Professor Bacon's home. He\r\nadvised me to remain where I was, and wait to find out whether or not I\r\nhad caught the plague.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The telephone bell rang 088]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo all of this I agreed, staying in my house and for the first time in\r\nmy life attempting to cook. And the plague did not come out on me. By\r\nmeans of the telephone I could talk with whomsoever I pleased and get\r\nthe news. Also, there were the newspapers, and I ordered all of them to\r\nbe thrown up to my door so that I could know what was happening with the\r\nrest of the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNew York City and Chicago were in chaos. And what happened with them\r\nwas happening in all the large cities. A third of the New York police\r\nwere dead. Their chief was also dead, likewise the mayor. All law and\r\norder had ceased. The bodies were lying in the streets un-buried. All\r\nrailroads and vessels carrying food and such things into the great\r\ncity had ceased runnings and mobs of the hungry poor were pillaging\r\nthe stores and warehouses. Murder and robbery and drunkenness were\r\neverywhere. Already the people had fled from the city by millions--at\r\nfirst the rich, in their private motor-cars and dirigibles, and then the\r\ngreat mass of the population, on foot, carrying the plague with them,\r\nthemselves starving and pillaging the farmers and all the towns and\r\nvillages on the way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fled from the city by millions 092]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man who sent this news, the wireless operator, was alone with his\r\ninstrument on the top of a lofty building. The people remaining in the\r\ncity--he estimated them at several hundred thousand--had gone mad from\r\nfear and drink, and on all sides of him great fires were raging. He was\r\na hero, that man who staid by his post--an obscure newspaperman, most\r\nlikely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor twenty-four hours, he said, no transatlantic airships had arrived,\r\nand no more messages were coming from England. He did state, though,\r\nthat a message from Berlin--that's in Germany--announced that Hoffmeyer,\r\na bacteriologist of the Metchnikoff School, had discovered the serum for\r\nthe plague. That was the last word, to this day, that we of America\r\never received from Europe. If Hoffmeyer discovered the serum, it was too\r\nlate, or otherwise, long ere this, explorers from Europe would have\r\ncome looking for us. We can only conclude that what happened in America\r\nhappened in Europe, and that, at the best, some several score may have\r\nsurvived the Scarlet Death on that whole continent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor one day longer the despatches continued to come from New York.\r\nThen they, too, ceased. The man who had sent them, perched in his lofty\r\nbuilding, had either died of the plague or been consumed in the great\r\nconflagrations he had described as raging around him. And what had\r\noccurred in New York had been duplicated in all the other cities. It was\r\nthe same in San Francisco, and Oakland, and Berkeley. By Thursday the\r\npeople were dying so rapidly that their corpses could not be handled,\r\nand dead bodies lay everywhere. Thursday night the panic outrush for\r\nthe country began. Imagine, my grandsons, people, thicker than the\r\nsalmon-run you have seen on the Sacramento river, pouring out of the\r\ncities by millions, madly over the country, in vain attempt to escape\r\nthe ubiquitous death. You see, they carried the germs with them. Even\r\nthe airships of the rich, fleeing for mountain and desert fastnesses,\r\ncarried the germs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHundreds of these airships escaped to Hawaii, and not only did they\r\nbring the plague with them, but they found the plague already there\r\nbefore them. This we learned, by the despatches, until all order in San\r\nFrancisco vanished, and there were no operators left at their posts to\r\nreceive or send. It was amazing, astounding, this loss of communication\r\nwith the world. It was exactly as if the world had ceased, been blotted\r\nout. For sixty years that world has no longer existed for me. I know\r\nthere must be such places as New York, Europe, Asia, and Africa; but not\r\none word has been heard of them--not in sixty years. With the coming of\r\nthe Scarlet Death the world fell apart, absolutely, irretrievably. Ten\r\nthousand years of culture and civilization passed in the twinkling of an\r\neye, 'lapsed like foam.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was telling about the airships of the rich. They carried the plague\r\nwith them and no matter where they fled, they died. I never encountered\r\nbut one survivor of any of them--Mungerson. He was afterwards a Santa\r\nRosan, and he married my eldest daughter. He came into the tribe eight\r\nyears after the plague. He was then nineteen years old, and he was\r\ncompelled to wait twelve years more before he could marry. You see,\r\nthere were no unmarried women, and some of the older daughters of the\r\nSanta Rosans were already bespoken. So he was forced to wait until\r\nmy Mary had grown to sixteen years. It was his son, Gimp-Leg, who was\r\nkilled last year by the mountain lion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMungerson was eleven years old at the time of the plague. His father\r\nwas one of the Industrial Magnates, a very wealthy, powerful man. It was\r\non his airship, the Condor, that they were fleeing, with all the family,\r\nfor the wilds of British Columbia, which is far to the north of here.\r\nBut there was some accident, and they were wrecked near Mount Shasta.\r\nYou have heard of that mountain. It is far to the north. The plague\r\nbroke out amongst them, and this boy of eleven was the only survivor.\r\nFor eight years he was alone, wandering over a deserted land and looking\r\nvainly for his own kind. And at last, travelling south, he picked up\r\nwith us, the Santa Rosans.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am ahead of my story. When the great exodus from the cities\r\naround San Francisco Bay began, and while the telephones were still\r\nworking, I talked with my brother. I told him this flight from the\r\ncities was insanity, that there were no symptoms of the plague in\r\nme, and that the thing for us to do was to isolate ourselves and our\r\nrelatives in some safe place. We decided on the Chemistry Building, at\r\nthe university, and we planned to lay in a supply of provisions, and by\r\nforce of arms to prevent any other persons from forcing their presence\r\nupon us after we had retired to our refuge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this being arranged, my brother begged me to stay in my own\r\nhouse for at least twenty-four hours more, on the chance of the plague\r\ndeveloping in me. To this I agreed, and he promised to come for me next\r\nday. We talked on over the details of the provisioning and the defending\r\nof the Chemistry Building until the telephone died. It died in the midst\r\nof our conversation. That evening there were no electric lights, and\r\nI was alone in my house in the darkness. No more newspapers were being\r\nprinted, so I had no knowledge of what was taking place outside.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I heard sounds of rioting and of pistol shots 098]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard sounds of rioting and of pistol shots, and from my windows I\r\ncould see the glare of the sky of some conflagration in the direction\r\nof Oakland. It was a night of terror. I did not sleep a wink. A man--why\r\nand how I do not know--was killed on the sidewalk in front of the house.\r\nI heard the rapid reports of an automatic pistol, and a few minutes\r\nlater the wounded wretch crawled up to my door, moaning and crying out\r\nfor help. Arming myself with two automatics, I went to him. By the light\r\nof a match I ascertained that while he was dying of the bullet wounds,\r\nat the same time the plague was on him. I fled indoors, whence I heard\r\nhim moan and cry out for half an hour longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the morning, my brother came to me. I had gathered into a handbag\r\nwhat things of value I purposed taking, but when I saw his face I knew\r\nthat he would never accompany me to the Chemistry Building. The plague\r\nwas on him. He intended shaking my hand, but I went back hurriedly\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Look at yourself in the mirror,' I commanded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Look at yourself in the mirror 100]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did so, and at sight of his scarlet face, the color deepening as he\r\nlooked at it, he sank down nervelessly in a chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'My God!' he said. 'I've got it. Don't come near me. I am a dead man.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the convulsions seized him. He was two hours in dying, and he\r\nwas conscious to the last, complaining about the coldness and loss of\r\nsensation in his feet, his calves, his thighs, until at last it was his\r\nheart and he was dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the way the Scarlet Death slew. I caught up my handbag and\r\nfled. The sights in the streets were terrible. One stumbled on bodies\r\neverywhere. Some were not yet dead. And even as you looked, you saw men\r\nsink down with the death fastened upon them. There were numerous fires\r\nburning in Berkeley, while Oakland and San Francisco were apparently\r\nbeing swept by vast conflagrations. The smoke of the burning filled the\r\nheavens, so that the midday was as a gloomy twilight, and, in the shifts\r\nof wind, sometimes the sun shone through dimly, a dull red orb. Truly,\r\nmy grandsons, it was like the last days of the end of the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were numerous stalled motor cars, showing that the gasoline and\r\nthe engine supplies of the garages had given out. I remember one such\r\ncar. A man and a woman lay back dead in the seats, and on the pavement\r\nnear it were two more women and a child. Strange and terrible sights\r\nthere were on every hand. People slipped by silently, furtively, like\r\nghosts--white-faced women carrying infants in their arms; fathers\r\nleading children by the hand; singly, and in couples, and in\r\nfamilies--all fleeing out of the city of death. Some carried supplies\r\nof food, others blankets and valuables, and there were many who carried\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a grocery store--a place where food was sold. The man to whom\r\nit belonged--I knew him well--a quiet, sober, but stupid and obstinate\r\nfellow, was defending it. The windows and doors had been broken in, but\r\nhe, inside, hiding behind a counter, was discharging his pistol at a\r\nnumber of men on the sidewalk who were breaking in. In the entrance were\r\nseveral bodies--of men, I decided, whom he had killed earlier in the\r\nday. Even as I looked on from a distance, I saw one of the robbers break\r\nthe windows of the adjoining store, a place where shoes were sold,\r\nand deliberately set fire to it. I did not go to the groceryman's\r\nassistance. The time for such acts had already passed. Civilization was\r\ncrumbling, and it was each for himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nI WENT away hastily, down a cross-street, and at the first corner I saw\r\nanother tragedy. Two men of the working class had caught a man and a\r\nwoman with two children, and were robbing them. I knew the man by sight,\r\nthough I had never been introduced to him. He was a poet whose verses I\r\nhad long admired. Yet I did not go to his help, for at the moment I came\r\nupon the scene there was a pistol shot, and I saw him sinking to the\r\nground. The woman screamed, and she was felled with a fist-blow by one\r\nof the brutes. I cried out threateningly, whereupon they discharged\r\ntheir pistols at me and I ran away around the corner. Here I was blocked\r\nby an advancing conflagration. The buildings on both sides were burning,\r\nand the street was filled with smoke and flame. From somewhere in that\r\nmurk came a woman's voice calling shrilly for help. But I did not go to\r\nher. A man's heart turned to iron amid such scenes, and one heard all\r\ntoo many appeals for help.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReturning to the corner, I found the two robbers were gone. The poet\r\nand his wife lay dead on the pavement. It was a shocking sight. The two\r\nchildren had vanished--whither I could not tell. And I knew, now, why\r\nit was that the fleeing persons I encountered slipped along so furtively\r\nand with such white faces. In the midst of our civilization, down in our\r\nslums and labor-ghettos, we had bred a race of barbarians, of savages;\r\nand now, in the time of our calamity, they turned upon us like the wild\r\nbeasts they were and destroyed us. And they destroyed themselves as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Now in the time of calamity they turned on us 108]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey inflamed themselves with strong drink and committed a thousand\r\natrocities, quarreling and killing one another in the general madness.\r\nOne group of workingmen I saw, of the better sort, who had banded\r\ntogether, and, with their women and children in their midst, the sick\r\nand aged in litters and being carried, and with a number of horses\r\npulling a truck-load of provisions, they were fighting their way out\r\nof the city. They made a fine spectacle as they came down the street\r\nthrough the drifting smoke, though they nearly shot me when I first\r\nappeared in their path. As they went by, one of their leaders shouted\r\nout to me in apologetic explanation. He said they were killing the\r\nrobbers and looters on sight, and that they had thus banded together as\r\nthe only-means by which to escape the prowlers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was here that I saw for the first time what I was soon to see so\r\noften. One of the marching men had suddenly shown the unmistakable mark\r\nof the plague. Immediately those about him drew away, and he, without\r\na remonstrance, stepped out of his place to let them pass on. A woman,\r\nmost probably his wife, attempted to follow him. She was leading a\r\nlittle boy by the hand. But the husband commanded her sternly to go on,\r\nwhile others laid hands on her and restrained her from following him.\r\nThis I saw, and I saw the man also, with his scarlet blaze of face, step\r\ninto a doorway on the opposite side of the street. I heard the report of\r\nhis pistol, and saw him sink lifeless to the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter being turned aside twice again by advancing fires, I succeeded in\r\ngetting through to the university. On the edge of the campus I came\r\nupon a party of university folk who were going in the direction of the\r\nChemistry Building. They were all family men, and their families were\r\nwith them, including the nurses and the servants. Professor Badminton\r\ngreeted me, I had difficulty in recognizing him. Somewhere he had gone\r\nthrough flames, and his beard was singed off. About his head was a\r\nbloody bandage, and his clothes were filthy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He told me he had been Cruelly Beaten 112]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told me he had prowlers, and that his brother had been killed the\r\nprevious night, in the defence of their dwelling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMidway across the campus, he pointed suddenly to Mrs. Swinton's face.\r\nThe unmistakable scarlet was there. Immediately all the other women set\r\nup a screaming and began to run away from her. Her two children were\r\nwith a nurse, and these also ran with the women. But her husband, Doctor\r\nSwinton, remained with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Go on, Smith,' he told me. 'Keep an eye on the children. As for me,\r\nI shall stay with my wife. I know she is as already dead, but I can't\r\nleave her. Afterwards, if I escape, I shall come to the Chemistry\r\nBuilding, and do you watch for me and let me in.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left him bending over his wife and soothing her last moments, while\r\nI ran to overtake the party. We were the last to be admitted to the\r\nChemistry Building. After that, with our automatic rifles we maintained\r\nour isolation. By our plans, we had arranged for a company of sixty to\r\nbe in this refuge. Instead, every one of the number originally planned\r\nhad added relatives and friends and whole families until there were over\r\nfour hundred souls. But the Chemistry Building was large, and, standing\r\nby itself, was in no danger of being burned by the great fires that\r\nraged everywhere in the city.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA large quantity of provisions had been gathered, and a food committee\r\ntook charge of it, issuing rations daily to the various families and\r\ngroups that arranged themselves into messes. A number of committees were\r\nappointed, and we developed a very efficient organization. I was on the\r\ncommittee of defence, though for the first day no prowlers came near. We\r\ncould see them in the distance, however, and by the smoke of their fires\r\nknew that several camps of them were occupying the far edge of the\r\ncampus. Drunkenness was rife, and often we heard them singing ribald\r\nsongs or insanely shouting. While the world crashed to ruin about them\r\nand all the air was filled with the smoke of its burning, these low\r\ncreatures gave rein to their bestiality and fought and drank and died.\r\nAnd after all, what did it matter? Everybody died anyway, the good and\r\nthe bad, the efficients and the weaklings, those that loved to live and\r\nthose that scorned to live. They passed. Everything passed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen twenty-four hours had gone by and no signs of the plague were\r\napparent, we congratulated ourselves and set about digging a well. You\r\nhave seen the great iron pipes which in those days carried water to all\r\nthe city-dwellers. We feared that the fires in the city would burst the\r\npipes and empty the reservoirs. So we tore up the cement floor of the\r\ncentral court of the Chemistry Building and dug a well. There were many\r\nyoung men, undergraduates, with us, and we worked night and day on the\r\nwell. And our fears were confirmed. Three hours before we reached water,\r\nthe pipes went dry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA second twenty-four hours passed, and still the plague did not\r\nappear among us. We thought we were saved. But we did not know what I\r\nafterwards decided to be true, namely, that the period of the incubation\r\nof the plague germs in a human's body was a matter of a number of days.\r\nIt slew so swiftly when once it manifested itself, that we were led to\r\nbelieve that the period of incubation was equally swift. So, when two\r\ndays had left us unscathed, we were elated with the idea that we were\r\nfree of the contagion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the third day disillusioned us. I can never forget the night\r\npreceding it. I had charge of the night guards from eight to twelve,\r\nand from the roof of the building I watched the passing of all man's\r\nglorious works. So terrible were the local conflagrations that all the\r\nsky was lighted up. One could read the finest print in the red glare.\r\nAll the world seemed wrapped in flames. San Francisco spouted smoke and\r\nfire from a score of vast conflagrations that were like so many active\r\nvolcanoes. Oakland, San Leandro, Haywards--all were burning; and to the\r\nnorthward, clear to Point Richmond, other fires were at work. It was an\r\nawe-inspiring spectacle. Civilization, my grandsons, civilization was\r\npassing in a sheet of flame and a breath of death. At ten o'clock that\r\nnight, the great powder magazines at Point Pinole exploded in rapid\r\nsuccession. So terrific were the concussions that the strong building\r\nrocked as in an earthquake, while every pane of glass was broken. It was\r\nthen that I left the roof and went down the long corridors, from room to\r\nroom, quieting the alarmed women and telling them what had happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn hour later, at a window on the ground floor, I heard pandemonium\r\nbreak out in the camps of the prowlers. There were cries and screams,\r\nand shots from many pistols. As we afterward conjectured, this fight had\r\nbeen precipitated by an attempt on the part of those that were well\r\nto drive out those that were sick. At any rate, a number of the\r\nplague-stricken prowlers escaped across the campus and drifted against\r\nour doors. We warned them back, but they cursed us and discharged a\r\nfusillade from their pistols. Professor Merryweather, at one of the\r\nwindows, was instantly killed, the bullet striking him squarely between\r\nthe eyes. We opened fire in turn, and all the prowlers fled away with\r\nthe exception of three. One was a woman. The plague was on them and they\r\nwere reckless. Like foul fiends, there in the red glare from the skies,\r\nwith faces blazing, they continued to curse us and fire at us. One of\r\nthe men I shot with my own hand. After that the other man and the woman,\r\nstill cursing us, lay down under our windows, where we were compelled to\r\nwatch them die of the plague.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe situation was critical. The explosions of the powder magazines\r\nhad broken all the windows of the Chemistry Building, so that we were\r\nexposed to the germs from the corpses. The sanitary committee was called\r\nupon to act, and it responded nobly. Two men were required to go out and\r\nremove the corpses, and this meant the probable sacrifice of their own\r\nlives, for, having performed the task, they were not to be permitted to\r\nreenter the building. One of the professors, who was a bachelor, and\r\none of the undergraduates volunteered. They bade good-bye to us and\r\nwent forth. They were heroes. They gave up their lives that four hundred\r\nothers might live. After they had performed their work, they stood for\r\na moment, at a distance, looking at us wistfully. Then they waved their\r\nhands in farewell and went away slowly across the campus toward the\r\nburning city.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet it was all useless. The next morning the first one of us was\r\nsmitten with the plague--a little nurse-girl in the family of Professor\r\nStout. It was no time for weak-kneed, sentimental policies. On the\r\nchance that she might be the only one, we thrust her forth from the\r\nbuilding and commanded her to be gone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: We thrust her forth from the building 121]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe went away slowly across the campus, wringing her hands and crying\r\npitifully. We felt like brutes, but what were we to do? There were four\r\nhundred of us, and individuals had to be sacrificed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn one of the laboratories three families had domiciled themselves, and\r\nthat afternoon we found among them no less than four corpses and seven\r\ncases of the plague in all its different stages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it was that the horror began. Leaving the dead lie, we forced the\r\nliving ones to segregate themselves in another room. The plague began to\r\nbreak out among the rest of us, and as fast as the symptoms appeared, we\r\nsent the stricken ones to these segregated rooms. We compelled them to\r\nwalk there by themselves, so as to avoid laying hands on them. It was\r\nheartrending. But still the plague raged among us, and room after\r\nroom was filled with the dead and dying. And so we who were yet clean\r\nretreated to the next floor and to the next, before this sea of the\r\ndead, that, room by room and floor by floor, inundated the building.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe place became a charnel house, and in the middle of the night\r\nthe survivors fled forth, taking nothing with them except arms and\r\nammunition and a heavy store of tinned foods. We camped on the opposite\r\nside of the campus from the prowlers, and, while some stood guard,\r\nothers of us volunteered to scout into the city in quest of horses,\r\nmotor cars, carts, and wagons, or anything that would carry our\r\nprovisions and enable us to emulate the banded workingmen I had seen\r\nfighting their way out to the open country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was one of these scouts; and Doctor Hoyle, remembering that his motor\r\ncar had been left behind in his home garage, told me to look for it. We\r\nscouted in pairs, and Dombey, a young undergraduate, accompanied me. We\r\nhad to cross half a mile of the residence portion of the city to get\r\nto Doctor Hoyle's home. Here the buildings stood apart, in the midst of\r\ntrees and grassy lawns, and here the fires had played freaks, burning\r\nwhole blocks, skipping blocks and often skipping a single house in a\r\nblock. And here, too, the prowlers were still at their work. We carried\r\nour automatic pistols openly in our hands, and looked desperate enough,\r\nforsooth, to keep them from attacking us. But at Doctor Hoyle's house\r\nthe thing happened. Untouched by fire, even as we came to it the smoke\r\nof flames burst forth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe miscreant who had set fire to it staggered down the steps and out\r\nalong the driveway. Sticking out of his coat pockets were bottles of\r\nwhiskey, and he was very drunk. My first impulse was to shoot him, and\r\nI have never ceased regretting that I did not. Staggering and maundering\r\nto himself, with bloodshot eyes, and a raw and bleeding slash down one\r\nside of his bewhiskered face, he was altogether the most nauseating\r\nspecimen of degradation and filth I had ever encountered. I did not\r\nshoot him, and he leaned against a tree on the lawn to let us go by.\r\nIt was the most absolute, wanton act. Just as we were opposite him,\r\nhe suddenly drew a pistol and shot Dombey through the head. The next\r\ninstant I shot him. But it was too late. Dombey expired without a groan,\r\nimmediately. I doubt if he even knew what had happened to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeaving the two corpses, I hurried on past the burning house to the\r\ngarage, and there found Doctor Hoyle's motor car. The tanks were filled\r\nwith gasoline, and it was ready for use. And it was in this car that I\r\nthreaded the streets of the ruined city and came back to the survivors\r\non the campus. The other scouts returned, but none had been so\r\nfortunate. Professor Fairmead had found a Shetland pony, but the poor\r\ncreature, tied in a stable and abandoned for days, was so weak from want\r\nof food and water that it could carry no burden at all. Some of the men\r\nwere for turning it loose, but I insisted that we should lead it along\r\nwith us, so that, if we got out of food, we would have it to eat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were forty-seven of us when we started, many being women and\r\nchildren. The President of the Faculty, an old man to begin with, and\r\nnow hopelessly broken by the awful happenings of the past week, rode\r\nin the motor car with several young children and the aged mother of\r\nProfessor Fairmead. Wathope, a young professor of English, who had a\r\ngrievous bullet-wound in his leg, drove the car. The rest of us walked,\r\nProfessor Fairmead leading the pony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was what should have been a bright summer day, but the smoke from\r\nthe burning world filled the sky, through which the sun shone murkily,\r\na dull and lifeless orb, blood-red and ominous. But we had grown\r\naccustomed to that blood-red sun. With the smoke it was different. It\r\nbit into our nostrils and eyes, and there was not one of us whose eyes\r\nwere not bloodshot. We directed our course to the southeast through the\r\nendless miles of suburban residences, travelling along where the first\r\nswells of low hills rose from the flat of the central city. It was by\r\nthis way, only, that we could expect to gain the country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur progress was painfully slow. The women and children could not walk\r\nfast. They did not dream of walking, my grandsons, in the way all people\r\nwalk to-day. In truth, none of us knew how to walk. It was not until\r\nafter the plague that I learned really to walk. So it was that the pace\r\nof the slowest was the pace of all, for we dared not separate on account\r\nof the prowlers. There were not so many now of these human beasts of\r\nprey. The plague had already well diminished their numbers, but enough\r\nstill lived to be a constant menace to us. Many of the beautiful\r\nresidences were untouched by fire, yet smoking ruins were everywhere.\r\nThe prowlers, too, seemed to have got over their insensate desire to\r\nburn, and it was more rarely that we saw houses freshly on fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeveral of us scouted among the private garages in search of motor cars\r\nand gasoline. But in this we were unsuccessful. The first great flights\r\nfrom the cities had swept all such utilities away. Calgan, a fine young\r\nman, was lost in this work. He was shot by prowlers while crossing a\r\nlawn. Yet this was our only casualty, though, once, a drunken brute\r\ndeliberately opened fire on all of us. Luckily, he fired wildly, and we\r\nshot him before he had done any hurt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt Fruitvale, still in the heart of the magnificent residence section\r\nof the city, the plague again smote us. Professor Fairmead was the\r\nvictim. Making signs to us that his mother was not to know, he turned\r\naside into the grounds of a beautiful mansion. He sat down forlornly on\r\nthe steps of the front veranda, and I, having lingered, waved him a last\r\nfarewell. That night, several miles beyond Fruitvale and still in the\r\ncity, we made camp. And that night we shifted camp twice to get away\r\nfrom our dead. In the morning there were thirty of us. I shall never\r\nforget the President of the Faculty. During the morning's march his\r\nwife, who was walking, betrayed the fatal symptoms, and when she\r\ndrew aside to let us go on, he insisted on leaving the motor car and\r\nremaining with her. There was quite a discussion about this, but in the\r\nend we gave in. It was just as well, for we knew not which ones of us,\r\nif any, might ultimately escape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat night, the second of our march, we camped beyond Haywards in the\r\nfirst stretches of country. And in the morning there were eleven of us\r\nthat lived. Also, during the night, Wathope, the professor with the\r\nwounded leg, deserted us in the motor car. He took with him his sister\r\nand his mother and most of our tinned provisions. It was that day, in\r\nthe afternoon, while resting by the wayside, that I saw the last airship\r\nI shall ever see. The smoke was much thinner here in the country, and I\r\nfirst sighted the ship drifting and veering helplessly at an elevation\r\nof two thousand feet. What had happened I could not conjecture, but even\r\nas we looked we saw her bow dip down lower and lower. Then the bulkheads\r\nof the various gas-chambers must have burst, for, quite perpendicular,\r\nshe fell like a plummet to the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: She fell like a plummet to the earth 132]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd from that day to this I have not seen another airship. Often and\r\noften, during the next few years, I scanned the sky for them, hoping\r\nagainst hope that somewhere in the world civilization had survived. But\r\nit was not to be. What happened with us in California must have happened\r\nwith everybody everywhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother day, and at Niles there were three of us. Beyond Niles, in the\r\nmiddle of the highway, we found Wathope. The motor car had broken down,\r\nand there, on the rugs which they had spread on the ground, lay the\r\nbodies of his sister, his mother, and himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWearied by the unusual exercise of continual walking, that night I\r\nslept heavily. In the morning I was alone in the world. Canfield and\r\nParsons, my last companions, were dead of the plague. Of the four\r\nhundred that sought shelter in the Chemistry Building, and of the\r\nforty-seven that began the march, I alone remained--I and the Shetland\r\npony. Why this should be so there is no explaining. I did not catch the\r\nplague, that is all. I was immune. I was merely the one lucky man in\r\na million--just as every survivor was one in a million, or, rather, in\r\nseveral millions, for the proportion was at least that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFOR two days I sheltered in a pleasant grove where there had been no\r\ndeaths. In those two days, while badly depressed and believing that my\r\nturn would come at any moment, nevertheless I rested and recuperated. So\r\ndid the pony. And on the third day, putting what small store of tinned\r\nprovisions I possessed on the pony's back, I started on across a very\r\nlonely land. Not a live man, woman, or child, did I encounter, though\r\nthe dead were everywhere. Food, however, was abundant. The land then\r\nwas not as it is now. It was all cleared of trees and brush, and it was\r\ncultivated. The food for millions of mouths was growing, ripening, and\r\ngoing to waste. From the fields and orchards I gathered vegetables,\r\nfruits, and berries. Around the deserted farmhouses I got eggs and\r\ncaught chickens. And frequently I found supplies of tinned provisions in\r\nthe store-rooms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA strange thing was what was taking place with all the domestic\r\nanimals. Everywhere they were going wild and preying on one another. The\r\nchickens and ducks were the first to be destroyed, while the pigs were\r\nthe first to go wild, followed by the cats. Nor were the dogs long in\r\nadapting themselves to the changed conditions. There was a veritable\r\nplague of dogs. They devoured the corpses, barked and howled during the\r\nnights, and in the daytime slunk about in the distance. As the time went\r\nby, I noticed a change in their behavior. At first they were apart from\r\none another, very suspicious and very prone to fight. But after a not\r\nvery long while they began to come together and run in packs. The dog,\r\nyou see, always was a social animal, and this was true before ever he\r\ncame to be domesticated by man. In the last days of the world before the\r\nplague, there were many many very different kinds of dogs--dogs without\r\nhair and dogs with warm fur, dogs so small that they would make scarcely\r\na mouthful for other dogs that were as large as mountain lions. Well,\r\nall the small dogs, and the weak types, were killed by their fellows.\r\nAlso, the very large ones were not adapted for the wild life and bred\r\nout. As a result, the many different kinds of dogs disappeared, and\r\nthere remained, running in packs, the medium-sized wolfish dogs that you\r\nknow to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the cats don't run in packs, Granser,\xe2\x80\x9d Hoo-Hoo objected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cat was never a social animal. As one writer in the nineteenth\r\ncentury said, the cat walks by himself. He always walked by himself,\r\nfrom before the time he was tamed by man, down through the long ages of\r\ndomestication, to to-day when once more he is wild.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe horses also went wild, and all the fine breeds we had degenerated\r\ninto the small mustang horse you know to-day. The cows likewise went\r\nwild, as did the pigeons and the sheep. And that a few of the chickens\r\nsurvived you know yourself. But the wild chicken of to-day is quite a\r\ndifferent thing from the chickens we had in those days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I must go on with my story. I travelled through a deserted land. As\r\nthe time went by I began to yearn more and more for human beings. But I\r\nnever found one, and I grew lonelier and lonelier. I crossed Livermore\r\nValley and the mountains between it and the great valley of the San\r\nJoaquin. You have never seen that valley, but it is very large and it is\r\nthe home of the wild horse. There are great droves there, thousands and\r\ntens of thousands. I revisited it thirty years after, so I know. You\r\nthink there are lots of wild horses down here in the coast valleys, but\r\nthey are as nothing compared with those of the San Joaquin. Strange to\r\nsay, the cows, when they went wild, went back into the lower mountains.\r\nEvidently they were better able to protect themselves there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the country districts the ghouls and prowlers had been less in\r\nevidence, for I found many villages and towns untouched by fire. But\r\nthey were filled by the pestilential dead, and I passed by without\r\nexploring them. It was near Lathrop that, out of my loneliness, I picked\r\nup a pair of collie dogs that were so newly free that they were urgently\r\nwilling to return to their allegiance to man. These collies accompanied\r\nme for many years, and the strains of them are in those very dogs there\r\nthat you boys have to-day. But in sixty years the collie strain has\r\nworked out. These brutes are more like domesticated wolves than anything\r\nelse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHare-Lip rose to his feet, glanced to see that the goats were safe,\r\nand looked at the sun's position in the afternoon sky, advertising\r\nimpatience at the prolixity of the old man's tale. Urged to hurry by\r\nEdwin, Granser went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is little more to tell. With my two dogs and my pony, and riding\r\na horse I had managed to capture, I crossed the San Joaquin and went on\r\nto a wonderful valley in the Sierras called Yosemite. In the great hotel\r\nthere I found a prodigious supply of tinned provisions. The pasture was\r\nabundant, as was the game, and the river that ran through the valley was\r\nfull of trout. I remained there three years in an utter loneliness that\r\nnone but a man who has once been highly civilized can understand. Then\r\nI could stand it no more. I felt that I was going crazy. Like the dog,\r\nI was a social animal and I needed my kind. I reasoned that since I had\r\nsurvived the plague, there was a possibility that others had survived.\r\nAlso, I reasoned that after three years the plague germs must all be\r\ngone and the land be clean again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: With my horse and dogs and pony, I set out 144]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith my horse and dogs and pony, I set out. Again I crossed the San\r\nJoaquin Valley, the mountains beyond, and came down into Livermore\r\nValley. The change in those three years was amazing. All the land had\r\nbeen splendidly tilled, and now I could scarcely recognize it, 'such was\r\nthe sea of rank vegetation that had overrun the agricultural handiwork\r\nof man. You see, the wheat, the vegetables, and orchard trees had always\r\nbeen cared for and nursed by man, so that they were soft and tender. The\r\nweeds and wild bushes and such things, on the contrary, had always been\r\nfought by man, so that they were tough and resistant. As a result, when\r\nthe hand of man was removed, the wild vegetation smothered and destroyed\r\npractically all the domesticated vegetation. The coyotes were greatly\r\nincreased, and it was at this time that I first encountered wolves,\r\nstraying in twos and threes and small packs down from the regions where\r\nthey had always persisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was at Lake Temescal, not far from the one-time city of Oakland,\r\nthat I came upon the first live human beings. Oh, my grandsons, how can\r\nI describe to you my emotion, when, astride my horse and dropping down\r\nthe hillside to the lake, I saw the smoke of a campfire rising through\r\nthe trees. Almost did my heart stop beating. I felt that I was going\r\ncrazy. Then I heard the cry of a babe--a human babe. And dogs barked,\r\nand my dogs answered. I did not know but what I was the one human alive\r\nin the whole world. It could not be true that here were others--smoke,\r\nand the cry of a babe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmerging on the lake, there, before my eyes, not a hundred yards away,\r\nI saw a man, a large man. He was standing on an outjutting rock and\r\nfishing. I was overcome. I stopped my horse. I tried to call out but\r\ncould not. I waved my hand. It seemed to me that the man looked at me,\r\nbut he did not appear to wave. Then I laid my head on my arms there\r\nin the saddle. I was afraid to look again, for I knew it was an\r\nhallucination, and I knew that if I looked the man would be gone. And so\r\nprecious was the hallucination, that I wanted it to persist yet a little\r\nwhile. I knew, too, that as long as I did not look it would persist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus I remained, until I heard my dogs snarling, and a man's voice.\r\nWhat do you think the voice said? I will tell you. It said: '_Where in\r\nhell did you come from??_'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose were the words, the exact words. That was what your other\r\ngrandfather said to me, Hare-Lip, when he greeted me there on the shore\r\nof Lake Temescal fifty-seven years ago. And they were the most ineffable\r\nwords I have ever heard. I opened my eyes, and there he stood before me,\r\na large, dark, hairy man, heavy-jawed, slant-browed, fierce-eyed. How I\r\ngot off my horse I do not know. But it seemed that the next I knew I was\r\nclasping his hand with both of mine and crying. I would have embraced\r\nhim, but he was ever a narrow-minded, suspicious man, and he drew away\r\nfrom me. Yet did I cling to his hand and cry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGranser's voice faltered and broke at the recollection, and the weak\r\ntears streamed down his cheeks while the boys looked on and giggled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet did I cry,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cand desire to embrace him, though the\r\nChauffeur was a brute, a perfect brute--the most abhorrent man I have\r\never known. His name was... strange, how I have forgotten his name.\r\nEverybody called him Chauffeur--it was the name of his occupation, and\r\nit stuck. That is how, to this day, the tribe he founded is called the\r\nChauffeur Tribe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Everybody called him Chauffeur 149]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a violent, unjust man. Why the plague germs spared him I can\r\nnever understand. It would seem, in spite of our old metaphysical\r\nnotions about absolute justice, that there is no justice in the\r\nuniverse. Why did he live?--an iniquitous, moral monster, a blot on the\r\nface of nature, a cruel, relentless, bestial cheat as well. All he\r\ncould talk about was motor cars, machinery, gasoline, and garages--and\r\nespecially, and with huge delight, of his mean pilferings and sordid\r\nswindlings of the persons who had employed him in the days before the\r\ncoming of the plague. And yet he was spared, while hundreds of millions,\r\nyea, billions, of better men were destroyed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vesta the one woman 150]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went on with him to his camp, and there I saw her, Vesta, the one\r\nwoman. It was glorious and... pitiful. There she was, Vesta Van Warden,\r\nthe young wife of John Van Warden, clad in rags, with marred and scarred\r\nand toil-calloused hands, bending over the campfire and doing scullion\r\nwork--she, Vesta, who had been born to the purple of the greatest\r\nbaronage of wealth the world had ever known. John Van Warden, her\r\nhusband, worth one billion, eight hundred millions and President of the\r\nBoard of Industrial Magnates, had been the ruler of America. Also,\r\nsitting on the International Board of Control, he had been one of the\r\nseven men who ruled the world. And she herself had come of equally noble\r\nstock. Her father, Philip Saxon, had been President of the Board of\r\nIndustrial Magnates up to the time of his death. This office was in\r\nprocess of becoming hereditary, and had Philip Saxon had a son that son\r\nwould have succeeded him. But his only child was Vesta, the perfect\r\nflower of generations of the highest culture this planet has ever\r\nproduced. It was not until the engagement between Vesta and Van Warden\r\ntook place, that Saxon indicated the latter as his successor. It was, I\r\nam sure, a political marriage. I have reason to believe that Vesta never\r\nreally loved her husband in the mad passionate way of which the poets\r\nused to sing. It was more like the marriages that obtained among crowned\r\nheads in the days before they were displaced by the Magnates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: There she was, boiling fish-chowder 153]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there she was, boiling fish-chowder in a soot-covered pot, her\r\nglorious eyes inflamed by the acrid smoke of the open fire. Hers was a\r\nsad story. She was the one survivor in a million, as I had been, as\r\nthe Chauffeur had been. On a crowning eminence of the Alameda Hills,\r\noverlooking San Francisco Bay, Van Warden had built a vast summer\r\npalace. It was surrounded by a park of a thousand acres. When the\r\nplague broke out, Van Warden sent her there. Armed guards patrolled the\r\nboundaries of the park, and nothing entered in the way of provisions or\r\neven mail matter that was not first fumigated. And yet did the plague\r\nenter, killing the guards at their posts, the servants at their tasks,\r\nsweeping away the whole army of retainers--or, at least, all of them who\r\ndid not flee to die elsewhere. So it was that Vesta found herself the\r\nsole living person in the palace that had become a charnel house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow the Chauffeur had been one of the servants that ran away.\r\nReturning, two months afterward, he discovered Vesta in a little summer\r\npavilion where there had been no deaths and where she had established\r\nherself. He was a brute. She was afraid, and she ran away and hid among\r\nthe trees. That night, on foot, she fled into the mountains--she, whose\r\ntender feet and delicate body had never known the bruise of stones nor\r\nthe scratch of briars. He followed, and that night he caught her. He\r\nstruck her. Do you understand? He beat her with those terrible fists of\r\nhis and made her his slave. It was she who had to gather the firewood,\r\nbuild the fires, cook, and do all the degrading camp-labor--she, who had\r\nnever performed a menial act in her life. These things he compelled her\r\nto do, while he, a proper savage, elected to lie around camp and look\r\non. He did nothing, absolutely nothing, except on occasion to hunt meat\r\nor catch fish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood for Chauffeur,\xe2\x80\x9d Hare-Lip commented in an undertone to the other\r\nboys. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember him before he died. He was a corker. But he did\r\nthings, and he made things go. You know, Dad married his daughter, an'\r\nyou ought to see the way he knocked the spots outa Dad. The Chauffeur\r\nwas a son-of-a-gun. He made us kids stand around. Even when he was\r\ncroaking he reached out for me, once, an' laid my head open with that\r\nlong stick he kept always beside him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHare-Lip rubbed his bullet head reminiscently, and the boys returned to\r\nthe old man, who was maundering ecstatically about Vesta, the squaw of\r\nthe founder of the Chauffeur Tribe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so I say to you that you cannot understand the awfulness of the\r\nsituation. The Chauffeur was a servant, understand, a servant. And he\r\ncringed, with bowed head, to such as she. She was a lord of life, both\r\nby birth and by marriage. The destinies of millions, such as he, she\r\ncarried in the hollow of her pink-white hand. And, in the days before\r\nthe plague, the slightest contact with such as he would have been\r\npollution. Oh, I have seen it. Once, I remember, there was Mrs. Goldwin,\r\nwife of one of the great magnates. It was on a landing stage, just\r\nas she was embarking in her private dirigible, that she dropped her\r\nparasol. A servant picked it up and made the mistake of handing it to\r\nher--to her, one of the greatest royal ladies of the land! She shrank\r\nback, as though he were a leper, and indicated her secretary to receive\r\nit. Also, she ordered her secretary to ascertain the creature's name and\r\nto see that he was immediately discharged from service. And such a woman\r\nwas Vesta Van Warden. And her the Chauffeur beat and made his slave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: And her the Chauffeur beat and made his slave 158]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c--Bill--that was it; Bill, the Chauffeur. That was his name. He was\r\na wretched, primitive man, wholly devoid of the finer instincts and\r\nchivalrous promptings of a cultured soul. No, there is no absolute\r\njustice, for to him fell that wonder of womanhood, Vesta Van Warden. The\r\ngrievous-ness of this you will never understand, my grandsons; for\r\nyou are yourselves primitive little savages, unaware of aught else but\r\nsavagery. Why should Vesta not have been mine? I was a man of culture\r\nand refinement, a professor in a great university. Even so, in the time\r\nbefore the plague, such was her exalted position, she would not have\r\ndeigned to know that I existed. Mark, then, the abysmal degradation\r\nto which she fell at the hands of the Chauffeur. Nothing less than the\r\ndestruction of all mankind had made it possible that I should know her,\r\nlook in her eyes, converse with her, touch her hand--ay, and love her\r\nand know that her feelings toward me were very kindly. I have reason to\r\nbelieve that she, even she, would have loved me, there being no other\r\nman in the world except the Chauffeur. Why, when it destroyed eight\r\nbillions of souls, did not the plague destroy just one more man, and\r\nthat man the Chauffeur?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce, when the Chauffeur was away fishing, she begged me to kill him.\r\nWith tears in her eyes she begged me to kill him. But he was a strong\r\nand violent man, and I was afraid. Afterwards, I talked with him. I\r\noffered him my horse, my pony, my dogs, all that I possessed, if he\r\nwould give Vesta to me. And he grinned in my face and shook his head. He\r\nwas very insulting. He said that in the old days he had been a servant,\r\nhad been dirt under the feet of men like me and of women like Vesta, and\r\nthat now he had the greatest lady in the land to be servant to him and\r\ncook his food and nurse his brats. 'You had your day before the plague,'\r\nhe said; 'but this is my day, and a damned good day it is. I wouldn't\r\ntrade back to the old times for anything.' Such words he spoke, but they\r\nare not his words. He was a vulgar, low-minded man, and vile oaths fell\r\ncontinually from his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlso, he told me that if he caught me making eyes at his woman he'd\r\nwring my neck and give her a beating as well. What was I to do? I was\r\nafraid. He was a brute. That first night, when I discovered the camp,\r\nVesta and I had great talk about the things of our vanished world. We\r\ntalked of art, and books, and poetry; and the Chauffeur listened and\r\ngrinned and sneered. He was bored and angered by our way of speech which\r\nhe did not comprehend, and finally he spoke up and said: 'And this is\r\nVesta Van Warden, one-time wife of Van Warden the Magnate--a high and\r\nstuck-up beauty, who is now my squaw. Eh, Professor Smith, times is\r\nchanged, times is changed. Here, you, woman, take off my moccasins,\r\nand lively about it. I want Professor Smith to see how well I have you\r\ntrained.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw her clench her teeth, and the flame of revolt rise in her face.\r\nHe drew back his gnarled fist to strike, and I was afraid, and sick at\r\nheart. I could do nothing to prevail against him. So I got up to go,\r\nand not be witness to such indignity. But the Chauffeur laughed and\r\nthreatened me with a beating if I did not stay and behold. And I sat\r\nthere, perforce, by the campfire on the shore of Lake Temescal, and\r\nsaw Vesta, Vesta Van Warden, kneel and remove the moccasins of that\r\ngrinning, hairy, apelike human brute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c--Oh, you do not understand, my grandsons. You have never known\r\nanything else, and you do not understand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Halter-broke and bridle-wise,' the Chauffeur gloated, while she\r\nperformed that dreadful, menial task. 'A trifle balky at times,\r\nProfessor, a trifle balky; but a clout alongside the jaw makes her as\r\nmeek and gentle as a lamb.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd another time he said: 'We've got to start all over and replenish\r\nthe earth and multiply. You're handicapped, Professor. You ain't got no\r\nwife, and we're up against a regular Garden-of-Eden proposition. But I\r\nain't proud. I'll tell you what, Professor.' He pointed at their little\r\ninfant, barely a year old. 'There's your wife, though you'll have to\r\nwait till she grows up. It's rich, ain't it? We're all equals here, and\r\nI'm the biggest toad in the splash. But I ain't stuck up--not I. I do\r\nyou the honor, Professor Smith, the very great honor of betrothing to\r\nyou my and Vesta Van Warden's daughter. Ain't it cussed bad that Van\r\nWarden ain't here to see?'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI LIVED three weeks of infinite torment there in the Chauffeur's camp.\r\nAnd then, one day, tiring of me, or of what to him was my bad effect\r\non Vesta, he told me that the year before, wandering through the Contra\r\nCosta Hills to the Straits of Carquinez, across the Straits he had seen\r\na smoke. This meant that there were still other human beings, and that\r\nfor three weeks he had kept this inestimably precious information from\r\nme. I departed at once, with my dogs and horses, and journeyed across\r\nthe Contra Costa Hills to the Straits. I saw no smoke on the other side,\r\nbut at Port Costa discovered a small steel barge on which I was able to\r\nembark my animals. Old canvas which I found served me for a sail, and\r\na southerly breeze fanned me across the Straits and up to the ruins\r\nof Vallejo. Here, on the outskirts of the city, I found evidences of a\r\nrecently occupied camp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Found evidences of a recently occupied camp 169]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany clam-shells showed me why these humans had come to the shores of\r\nthe Bay. This was the Santa Rosa Tribe, and I followed its track along\r\nthe old railroad right of way across the salt marshes to Sonoma Valley.\r\nHere, at the old brickyard at Glen Ellen, I came upon the camp. There\r\nwere eighteen souls all told. Two were old men, one of whom was Jones, a\r\nbanker. The other was Harrison, a retired pawnbroker, who had taken for\r\nwife the matron of the State Hospital for the Insane at Napa. Of all the\r\npersons of the city of Napa, and of all the other towns and villages\r\nin that rich and populous valley, she had been the only survivor. Next,\r\nthere were the three young men--Cardiff and Hale, who had been farmers,\r\nand Wainwright, a common day-laborer. All three had found wives. To\r\nHale, a crude, illiterate farmer, had fallen Isadore, the greatest\r\nprize, next to Vesta, of the women who came through the plague. She was\r\none of the world's most noted singers, and the plague had caught her at\r\nSan Francisco. She has talked with me for hours at a time, telling me of\r\nher adventures, until, at last, rescued by Hale in the Mendocino Forest\r\nReserve, there had remained nothing for her to do but become his wife.\r\nBut Hale was a good fellow, in spite of his illiteracy. He had a keen\r\nsense of justice and right-dealing, and she was far happier with him\r\nthan was Vesta with the Chauffeur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wives of Cardiff and Wainwright were ordinary women, accustomed\r\nto toil with strong constitutions--just the type for the wild new life\r\nwhich they were compelled to live. In addition were two adult idiots\r\nfrom the feeble-minded home at Eldredge, and five or six young children\r\nand infants born after the formation of the Santa Rosa Tribe. Also,\r\nthere was Bertha. She was a good woman, Hare-Lip, in spite of the sneers\r\nof your father. Her I took for wife. She was the mother of your father,\r\nEdwin, and of yours, Hoo-Hoo. And it was our daughter, Vera, who married\r\nyour father, Hare-Lip--your father, Sandow, who was the oldest son of\r\nVesta Van Warden and the Chauffeur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so it was that I became the nineteenth member of the Santa Rosa\r\nTribe. There were only two outsiders added after me. One was Mungerson,\r\ndescended from the Magnates, who wandered alone in the wilds of Northern\r\nCalifornia for eight years before he came south and joined us. He it was\r\nwho waited twelve years more before he married my daughter, Mary. The\r\nother was Johnson, the man who founded the Utah Tribe. That was where he\r\ncame from, Utah, a country that lies very far away from here, across the\r\ngreat deserts, to the east. It was not until twenty-seven years after\r\nthe plague that Johnson reached California. In all that Utah region he\r\nreported but three survivors, himself one, and all men. For many years\r\nthese three men lived and hunted together, until, at last, desperate,\r\nfearing that with them the human race would perish utterly from the\r\nplanet, they headed westward on the possibility of finding women\r\nsurvivors in California. Johnson alone came through the great desert,\r\nwhere his two companions died. He was forty-six years old when he joined\r\nus, and he married the fourth daughter of Isadore and Hale, and his\r\neldest son married your aunt, Hare-Lip, who was the third daughter of\r\nVesta and the Chauffeur. Johnson was a strong man, with a will of his\r\nown. And it was because of this that he seceded from the Santa Rosans\r\nand formed the Utah Tribe at San Jos\xc3\xa9. It is a small tribe--there are\r\nonly nine in it; but, though he is dead, such was his influence and the\r\nstrength of his breed, that it will grow into a strong tribe and play a\r\nleading part in the recivilization of the planet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are only two other tribes that we know of--the Los Angelitos\r\nand the Carmelitos. The latter started from one man and woman. He was\r\ncalled Lopez, and he was descended from the ancient Mexicans and was\r\nvery black. He was a cowherd in the ranges beyond Carmel, and his wife\r\nwas a maidservant in the great Del Monte Hotel. It was seven years\r\nbefore we first got in touch with the Los Angelitos. They have a\r\ngood country down there, but it is too warm. I estimate the present\r\npopulation of the world at between three hundred and fifty and four\r\nhundred--provided, of course, that there are no scattered little tribes\r\nelsewhere in the world. If there be such, we have not heard from them.\r\nSince Johnson crossed the desert from Utah, no word nor sign has come\r\nfrom the East or anywhere else. The great world which I knew in my\r\nboyhood and early manhood is gone. It has ceased to be. I am the last\r\nman who was alive in the days of the plague and who knows the wonders of\r\nthat far-off time. We, who mastered the planet--its earth, and sea, and\r\nsky--and who were as very gods, now live in primitive savagery along the\r\nwater courses of this California country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we are increasing rapidly--your sister, Hare-Lip, already has four\r\nchildren. We are increasing rapidly and making ready for a new climb\r\ntoward civilization. In time, pressure of population will compel us\r\nto spread out, and a hundred generations from now we may expect our\r\ndescendants to start across the Sierras, oozing slowly along, generation\r\nby generation, over the great continent to the colonization of the\r\nEast--a new Aryan drift around the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it will be slow, very slow; we have so far to climb. We fell so\r\nhopelessly far. If only one physicist or one chemist had survived!\r\nBut it was not to be, and we have forgotten everything. The Chauffeur\r\nstarted working in iron. He made the forge which we use to this day.\r\nBut he was a lazy man, and when he died he took with him all he knew\r\nof metals and machinery. What was I to know of such things? I was a\r\nclassical scholar, not a chemist.. The other men who survived were not\r\neducated. Only two things did the Chauffeur accomplish--the brewing\r\nof strong drink and the growing of tobacco. It was while he was drunk,\r\nonce, that he killed Vesta. I firmly believe that he killed Vesta in a\r\nfit of drunken cruelty though he always maintained that she fell into\r\nthe lake and was drowned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, my grandsons, let me warn you against the medicine-men. They call\r\nthemselves _doctors_, travestying what was once a noble profession, but\r\nin reality they are medicine-men, devil-devil men, and they make for\r\nsuperstition and darkness. They are cheats and liars. But so debased and\r\ndegraded are we, that we believe their lies. They, too, will increase\r\nin numbers as we increase, and they will strive to rule us. Yet are\r\nthey liars and charlatans. Look at young Cross-Eyes, posing as a\r\ndoctor, selling charms against sickness, giving good hunting,\r\nexchanging promises of fair weather for good meat and skins, sending the\r\ndeath-stick, performing a thousand abominations. Yet I say to you,\r\nthat when he says he can do these things, he lies. I, Professor Smith,\r\nProfessor James Howard Smith, say that he lies. I have told him so to\r\nhis teeth. Why has he not sent me the death-stick? Because he knows that\r\nwith me it is without avail. But you, Hare-Lip, so deeply are you\r\nsunk in black superstition that did you awake this night and find the\r\ndeath-stick beside you, you would surely die. And you would die, not\r\nbecause of any virtues in the stick, but because you are a savage with\r\nthe dark and clouded mind of a savage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctors must be destroyed, and all that was lost must be discovered\r\nover again. Wherefore, earnestly, I repeat unto you certain things which\r\nyou must remember and tell to your children after you. You must tell\r\nthem that when water is made hot by fire, there resides in it a\r\nwonderful thing called steam, which is stronger than ten thousand men\r\nand which can do all man's work for him. There are other very useful\r\nthings. In the lightning flash resides a similarly strong servant of\r\nman, which was of old his slave and which some day will be his slave\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I have stored many books in a cave 179]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite a different thing is the alphabet. It is what enables me to\r\nknow the meaning of fine markings, whereas you boys know only rude\r\npicture-writing. In that dry cave on Telegraph Hill, where you see me\r\noften go when the tribe is down by the sea, I have stored many books.\r\nIn them is great wisdom. Also, with them, I have placed a key to the\r\nalphabet, so that one who knows picture-writing may also know print.\r\nSome day men will read again; and then, if no accident has befallen my\r\ncave, they will know that Professor James Howard Smith once lived and\r\nsaved for them the knowledge of the ancients.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is another little device that men inevitably will rediscover. It\r\nis called gunpowder. It was what enabled us to kill surely and at long\r\ndistances. Certain things which are found in the ground, when combined\r\nin the right proportions, will make this gunpowder. What these things\r\nare, I have forgotten, or else I never knew. But I wish I did know. Then\r\nwould I make powder, and then would I certainly kill Cross-Eyes and rid\r\nthe land of superstition--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter I am man-grown I am going to give Cross-Eyes all the goats,\r\nand meat, and skins I can get, so that he'll teach me to be a doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Hoo-Hoo asserted. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd when I know, I'll make everybody else sit up and\r\ntake notice. They'll get down in the dirt to me, you bet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man nodded his head solemnly, and murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange it is to hear the vestiges and remnants of the complicated\r\nAryan speech falling from the lips of a filthy little skin-clad savage.\r\nAll the world is topsy-turvy. And it has been topsy-turvy ever since the\r\nplague.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won't make me sit up,\xe2\x80\x9d Hare-Lip boasted to the would-be\r\nmedicine-man. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I paid you for a sending of the death-stick and it\r\ndidn't work, I'd bust in your head--understand, you Hoo-Hoo, you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm going to get Granser to remember this here gunpowder stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d Edwin\r\nsaid softly, \xe2\x80\x9cand then I'll have you all on the run. You, Hare-Lip, will\r\ndo my fighting for me and get my meat for me, and you, Hoo-Hoo, will\r\nsend the death-stick for me and make everybody afraid. And if I catch\r\nHare-Lip trying to bust your head, Hoo-Hoo, I'll fix him with that same\r\ngunpowder. Granser ain't such a fool as you think, and I'm going to\r\nlisten to him and some day I'll be boss over the whole bunch of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man shook his head sadly, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gunpowder will come. Nothing can stop it--the same old story over\r\nand over. Man will increase, and men will fight. The gunpowder will\r\nenable men to kill millions of men, and in this way only, by fire and\r\nblood, will a new civilization, in some remote day, be evolved. And of\r\nwhat profit will it be? Just as the old civilization passed, so will the\r\nnew. It may take fifty thousand years to build, but it will pass. All\r\nthings pass. Only remain cosmic force and matter, ever in flux, ever\r\nacting and reacting and realizing the eternal types--the priest, the\r\nsoldier, and the king. Out of the mouths of babes comes the wisdom of\r\nall the ages. Some will fight, some will rule, some will pray; and all\r\nthe rest will toil and suffer sore while on their bleeding carcasses\r\nis reared again, and yet again, without end, the amazing beauty and\r\nsurpassing wonder of the civilized state. It were just as well that I\r\ndestroyed those cave-stored books--whether they remain or perish, all\r\ntheir old truths will be discovered, their old lies lived and handed\r\ndown. What is the profit--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHare-Lip leaped to his feet, giving a quick glance at the pasturing\r\ngoats and the afternoon sun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGee!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered to Edwin, \xe2\x80\x9cThe old geezer gets more long-winded every\r\nday. Let's pull for camp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile the other two, aided by the dogs, assembled the goats and started\r\nthem for the trail through the forest, Edwin stayed by the old man and\r\nguided him in the same direction. When they reached the old right of\r\nway, Edwin stopped suddenly and looked back. Hare-Lip and Hoo-Hoo and\r\nthe dogs and the goats passed on. Edwin was looking at a small herd of\r\nwild horses which had come down on the hard sand. There were at least\r\ntwenty of them, young colts and yearlings and mares, led by a beautiful\r\nstallion which stood in the foam at the edge of the surf, with arched\r\nneck and bright wild eyes, sniffing the salt air from off the sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d Granser queried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorses,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst time I ever seen 'em on the beach. It's\r\nthe mountain lions getting thicker and thicker and driving 'em down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe low sun shot red shafts of light, fan-shaped, up from a\r\ncloud-tumbled horizon. And close at hand, in the white waste of\r\nshore-lashed waters, the sea-lions, bellowing their old primeval chant,\r\nhauled up out of the sea on the black rocks and fought and loved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Granser,\xe2\x80\x9d Edwin prompted. And old man and boy, skin-clad and\r\nbarbaric, turned and went along the right of way into the forest in the\r\nwake of the goats.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Scarlet Plague, by Jack London\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SCARLET PLAGUE ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 21970-0.txt or 21970-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/1/9/7/21970/\r\n\r\nProduced by David Widger\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n"
