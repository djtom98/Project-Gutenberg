Voila toute la difference."\r\n\r\nToward the end of the year 1920 the Government of the United States had\r\npractically completed the programme, adopted during the last months of\r\nPresident Winthrop\'s administration. The country was apparently tranquil.\r\nEverybody knows how the Tariff and Labour questions were settled. The war\r\nwith Germany, incident on that country\'s seizure of the Samoan Islands,\r\nhad left no visible scars upon the republic, and the temporary occupation\r\nof Norfolk by the invading army had been forgotten in the joy over\r\nrepeated naval victories, and the subsequent ridiculous plight of General\r\nVon Gartenlaube\'s forces in the State of New Jersey. The Cuban and\r\nHawaiian investments had paid one hundred per cent and the territory of\r\nSamoa was well worth its cost as a coaling station. The country was in a\r\nsuperb state of defence. Every coast city had been well supplied with land\r\nfortifications; the army under the parental eye of the General Staff,\r\norganized according to the Prussian system, had been increased to 300,000\r\nmen, with a territorial reserve of a million; and six magnificent\r\nsquadrons of cruisers and battle-ships patrolled the six stations of the\r\nnavigable seas, leaving a steam reserve amply fitted to control home\r\nwaters. The gentlemen from the West had at last been constrained to\r\nacknowledge that a college for the training of diplomats was as necessary\r\nas law schools are for the training of barristers; consequently we were no\r\nlonger represented abroad by incompetent patriots. The nation was\r\nprosperous; Chicago, for a moment paralyzed after a second great fire, had\r\nrisen from its ruins, white and imperial, and more beautiful than the white\r\ncity which had been built for its plaything in 1893. Everywhere good\r\narchitecture was replacing bad, and even in New York, a sudden craving for\r\ndecency had swept away a great portion of the existing horrors. Streets\r\nhad been widened, properly paved and lighted, trees had been planted,\r\nsquares laid out, elevated structures demolished and underground roads\r\nbuilt to replace them. The new government buildings and barracks were fine\r\nbits of architecture, and the long system of stone quays which completely\r\nsurrounded the island had been turned into parks which proved a god-send\r\nto the population. The subsidizing of the state theatre and state opera\r\nbrought its own reward. The United States National Academy of Design was\r\nmuch like European institutions of the same kind. Nobody envied the\r\nSecretary of Fine Arts, either his cabinet position or his portfolio. The\r\nSecretary of Forestry and Game Preservation had a much easier time, thanks\r\nto the new system of National Mounted Police. We had profited well by the\r\nlatest treaties with France and England; the exclusion of foreign-born\r\nJews as a measure of self-preservation, the settlement of the new\r\nindependent negro state of Suanee, the checking of immigration, the new\r\nlaws concerning naturalization, and the gradual centralization of power in\r\nthe executive all contributed to national calm and prosperity. When the\r\nGovernment solved the Indian problem and squadrons of Indian cavalry\r\nscouts in native costume were substituted for the pitiable organizations\r\ntacked on to the tail of skeletonized regiments by a former Secretary of\r\nWar, the nation drew a long sigh of relief. When, after the colossal\r\nCongress of Religions, bigotry and intolerance were laid in their graves\r\nand kindness and charity began to draw warring sects together, many\r\nthought the millennium had arrived, at least in the new world which after\r\nall is a world by itself.\r\n\r\nBut self-preservation is the first law, and the United States had to look\r\non in helpless sorrow as Germany, Italy, Spain and Belgium writhed in the\r\nthroes of Anarchy, while Russia, watching from the Caucasus, stooped and\r\nbound them one by one.\r\n\r\nIn the city of New York the summer of 1899 was signalized by the\r\ndismantling of the Elevated Railroads. The summer of 1900 will live in\r\nthe memories of New York people for many a cycle; the Dodge Statue was\r\nremoved in that year. In the following winter began that agitation for\r\nthe repeal of the laws prohibiting suicide which bore its final fruit in\r\nthe month of April, 1920, when the first Government Lethal Chamber was\r\nopened on Washington Square.\r\n\r\nI had walked down that day from Dr. Archer\'s house on Madison Avenue,\r\nwhere I had been as a mere formality. Ever since that fall from my horse,\r\nfour years before, I had been troubled at times with pains in the back of\r\nmy head and neck, but now for months they had been absent, and the doctor\r\nsent me away that day saying there was nothing more to be cured in me. It\r\nwas hardly worth his fee to be told that; I knew it myself. Still I did\r\nnot grudge him the money. What I minded was the mistake which he made at\r\nfirst. When they picked me up from the pavement where I lay unconscious,\r\nand somebody had mercifully sent a bullet through my horse\'s head, I was\r\ncarried to Dr. Archer, and he, pronouncing my brain affected, placed me\r\nin his private asylum where I was obliged to endure treatment for\r\ninsanity. At last he decided that I was well, and I, knowing that my mind\r\nhad always been as sound as his, if not sounder, "paid my tuition" as he\r\njokingly called it, and left. I told him, smiling, that I would get even\r\nwith him for his mistake, and he laughed heartily, and asked me to call\r\nonce in a while. I did so, hoping for a chance to even up accounts, but\r\nhe gave me none, and I told him I would wait.\r\n\r\nThe fall from my horse had fortunately left no evil results; on the\r\ncontrary it had changed my whole character for the better. From a lazy\r\nyoung man about town, I had become active, energetic, temperate, and\r\nabove all--oh, above all else--ambitious. There was only one thing which\r\ntroubled me, I laughed at my own uneasiness, and yet it troubled me.\r\n\r\nDuring my convalescence I had bought and read for the first time, _The\r\nKing in Yellow_. I remember after finishing the first act that it\r\noccurred to me that I had better stop. I started up and flung the book\r\ninto the fireplace; the volume struck the barred grate and fell open on\r\nthe hearth in the firelight. If I had not caught a glimpse of the opening\r\nwords in the second act I should never have finished it, but as I stooped\r\nto pick it up, my eyes became riveted to the open page, and with a cry of\r\nterror, or perhaps it was of joy so poignant that I suffered in every\r\nnerve, I snatched the thing out of the coals and crept shaking to my\r\nbedroom, where I read it and reread it, and wept and laughed and trembled\r\nwith a horror which at times assails me yet. This is the thing that\r\ntroubles me, for I cannot forget Carcosa where black stars hang in the\r\nheavens; where the shadows of men\'s thoughts lengthen in the afternoon,\r\nwhen the twin suns sink into the lake of Hali; and my mind will bear for\r\never the memory of the Pallid Mask. I pray God will curse the writer, as\r\nthe writer has cursed the world with this beautiful, stupendous creation,\r\nterrible in its simplicity, irresistible in its truth--a world which now\r\ntrembles before the King in Yellow. When the French Government seized the\r\ntranslated copies which had just arrived in Paris, London, of course,\r\nbecame eager to read it. It is well known how the book spread like an\r\ninfectious disease, from city to city, from continent to continent,\r\nbarred out here, confiscated there, denounced by Press and pulpit,\r\ncensured even by the most advanced of literary anarchists. No definite\r\nprinciples had been violated in those wicked pages, no doctrine\r\npromulgated, no convictions outraged. It could not be judged by any known\r\nstandard, yet, although it was acknowledged that the supreme note of art\r\nhad been struck in _The King in Yellow_, all felt that human nature\r\ncould not bear the strain, nor thrive on words in which the essence of\r\npurest poison lurked. The very banality and innocence of the first act\r\nonly allowed the blow to fall afterward with more awful effect.\r\n\r\nIt was, I remember, the 13th day of April, 1920, that the first\r\nGovernment Lethal Chamber was established on the south side of Washington\r\nSquare, between Wooster Street and South Fifth Avenue. The block which\r\nhad formerly consisted of a lot of shabby old buildings, used as cafes\r\nand restaurants for foreigners, had been acquired by the Government in\r\nthe winter of 1898. The French and Italian cafes and restaurants were\r\ntorn down; the whole block was enclosed by a gilded iron railing, and\r\nconverted into a lovely garden with lawns, flowers and fountains. In the\r\ncentre of the garden stood a small, white building, severely classical in\r\narchitecture, and surrounded by thickets of flowers. Six Ionic columns\r\nsupported the roof, and the single door was of bronze. A splendid marble\r\ngroup of the "Fates" stood before the door, the work of a young American\r\nsculptor, Boris Yvain, who had died in Paris when only twenty-three years\r\nold.\r\n\r\nThe inauguration ceremonies were in progress as I crossed University\r\nPlace and entered the square. I threaded my way through the silent throng\r\nof spectators, but was stopped at Fourth Street by a cordon of police. A\r\nregiment of United States lancers were drawn up in a hollow square round\r\nthe Lethal Chamber. On a raised tribune facing Washington Park stood the\r\nGovernor of New York, and behind him were grouped the Mayor of New\r\nYork and Brooklyn, the Inspector-General of Police, the Commandant of\r\nthe state troops, Colonel Livingston, military aid to the President of the\r\nUnited States, General Blount, commanding at Governor\'s Island,\r\nMajor-General Hamilton, commanding the garrison of New York and Brooklyn,\r\nAdmiral Buffby of the fleet in the North River, Surgeon-General\r\nLanceford, the staff of the National Free Hospital, Senators Wyse and\r\nFranklin of New York, and the Commissioner of Public Works. The tribune\r\nwas surrounded by a squadron of hussars of the National Guard.\r\n\r\nThe Governor was finishing his reply to the short speech of the\r\nSurgeon-General. I heard him say: "The laws prohibiting suicide and\r\nproviding punishment for any attempt at self-destruction have been\r\nrepealed. The Government has seen fit to acknowledge the right of man to\r\nend an existence which may have become intolerable to him, through\r\nphysical suffering or mental despair. It is believed that the community\r\nwill be benefited by the removal of such people from their midst. Since\r\nthe passage of this law, the number of suicides in the United States has\r\nnot increased. Now the Government has determined to establish a Lethal\r\nChamber in every city, town and village in the country, it remains to be\r\nseen whether or not that class of human creatures from whose desponding\r\nranks new victims of self-destruction fall daily will accept the relief\r\nthus provided." He paused, and turned to the white Lethal Chamber. The\r\nsilence in the street was absolute. "There a painless death awaits him\r\nwho can no longer bear the sorrows of this life. If death is welcome let\r\nhim seek it there." Then quickly turning to the military aid of the\r\nPresident\'s household, he said, "I declare the Lethal Chamber open," and\r\nagain facing the vast crowd he cried in a clear voice: "Citizens of New\r\nYork and of the United States of America, through me the Government\r\ndeclares the Lethal Chamber to be open."\r\n\r\nThe solemn hush was broken by a sharp cry of command, the squadron of\r\nhussars filed after the Governor\'s carriage, the lancers wheeled and\r\nformed along Fifth Avenue to wait for the commandant of the garrison, and\r\nthe mounted police followed them. I left the crowd to gape and stare at\r\nthe white marble Death Chamber, and, crossing South Fifth Avenue, walked\r\nalong the western side of that thoroughfare to Bleecker Street. Then I\r\nturned to the right and stopped before a dingy shop which bore the sign:\r\n\r\nHAWBERK, ARMOURER.\r\n\r\nI glanced in at the doorway and saw Hawberk busy in his little shop at\r\nthe end of the hall. He looked up, and catching sight of me cried in his\r\ndeep, hearty voice, "Come in, Mr. Castaigne!" Constance, his daughter,\r\nrose to meet me as I crossed the threshold, and held out her pretty\r\nhand, but I saw the blush of disappointment on her cheeks, and knew\r\nthat it was another Castaigne she had expected, my cousin Louis. I\r\nsmiled at her confusion and complimented her on the banner she was\r\nembroidering from a coloured plate. Old Hawberk sat riveting the worn\r\ngreaves of some ancient suit of armour, and the ting! ting! ting! of his\r\nlittle hammer sounded pleasantly in the quaint shop. Presently he\r\ndropped his hammer, and fussed about for a moment with a tiny wrench.\r\nThe soft clash of the mail sent a thrill of pleasure through me. I\r\nloved to hear the music of steel brushing against steel, the mellow\r\nshock of the mallet on thigh pieces, and the jingle of chain armour.\r\nThat was the only reason I went to see Hawberk. He had never interested\r\nme personally, nor did Constance, except for the fact of her being in\r\nlove with Louis. This did occupy my attention, and sometimes even kept\r\nme awake at night. But I knew in my heart that all would come right,\r\nand that I should arrange their future as I expected to arrange that of\r\nmy kind doctor, John Archer. However, I should never have troubled\r\nmyself about visiting them just then, had it not been, as I say, that\r\nthe music of the tinkling hammer had for me this strong fascination. I\r\nwould sit for hours, listening and listening, and when a stray sunbeam\r\nstruck the inlaid steel, the sensation it gave me was almost too keen\r\nto endure. My eyes would become fixed, dilating with a pleasure that\r\nstretched every nerve almost to breaking, until some movement of the\r\nold armourer cut off the ray of sunlight, then, still thrilling\r\nsecretly, I leaned back and listened again to the sound of the\r\npolishing rag, swish! swish! rubbing rust from the rivets.\r\n\r\nConstance worked with the embroidery over her knees, now and then pausing\r\nto examine more closely the pattern in the coloured plate from the\r\nMetropolitan Museum.\r\n\r\n"Who is this for?" I asked.\r\n\r\nHawberk explained, that in addition to the treasures of armour in the\r\nMetropolitan Museum of which he had been appointed armourer, he also\r\nhad charge of several collections belonging to rich amateurs. This was the\r\nmissing greave of a famous suit which a client of his had traced to a\r\nlittle shop in Paris on the Quai d\'Orsay. He, Hawberk, had negotiated for\r\nand secured the greave, and now the suit was complete. He laid down his\r\nhammer and read me the history of the suit, traced since 1450 from owner\r\nto owner until it was acquired by Thomas Stainbridge. When his superb\r\ncollection was sold, this client of Hawberk\'s bought the suit, and since\r\nthen the search for the missing greave had been pushed until it was,\r\nalmost by accident, located in Paris.\r\n\r\n"Did you continue the search so persistently without any certainty of the\r\ngreave being still in existence?" I demanded.\r\n\r\n"Of course," he replied coolly.\r\n\r\nThen for the first time I took a personal interest in Hawberk.\r\n\r\n"It was worth something to you," I ventured.\r\n\r\n"No," he replied, laughing, "my pleasure in finding it was my reward."\r\n\r\n"Have you no ambition to be rich?" I asked, smiling.\r\n\r\n"My one ambition is to be the best armourer in the world," he answered\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\nConstance asked me if I had seen the ceremonies at the Lethal Chamber.\r\nShe herself had noticed cavalry passing up Broadway that morning, and had\r\nwished to see the inauguration, but her father wanted the banner\r\nfinished, and she had stayed at his request.\r\n\r\n"Did you see your cousin, Mr. Castaigne, there?" she asked, with the\r\nslightest tremor of her soft eyelashes.\r\n\r\n"No," I replied carelessly. "Louis\' regiment is manoeuvring out in\r\nWestchester County." I rose and picked up my hat and cane.\r\n\r\n"Are you going upstairs to see the lunatic again?" laughed old Hawberk.\r\nIf Hawberk knew how I loathe that word "lunatic," he would never use it\r\nin my presence. It rouses certain feelings within me which I do not care\r\nto explain. However, I answered him quietly: "I think I shall drop in and\r\nsee Mr. Wilde for a moment or two."\r\n\r\n"Poor fellow," said Constance, with a shake of the head, "it must be hard\r\nto live alone year after year poor, crippled and almost demented. It is\r\nvery good of you, Mr. Castaigne, to visit him as often as you do."\r\n\r\n"I think he is vicious," observed Hawberk, beginning again with his\r\nhammer. I listened to the golden tinkle on the greave plates; when he had\r\nfinished I replied:\r\n\r\n"No, he is not vicious, nor is he in the least demented. His mind is a\r\nwonder chamber, from which he can extract treasures that you and I would\r\ngive years of our life to acquire."\'\r\n\r\nHawberk laughed.\r\n\r\nI continued a little impatiently: "He knows history as no one else could\r\nknow it. Nothing, however trivial, escapes his search, and his memory is\r\nso absolute, so precise in details, that were it known in New York that\r\nsuch a man existed, the people could not honour him enough."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense," muttered Hawberk, searching on the floor for a fallen rivet.\r\n\r\n"Is it nonsense," I asked, managing to suppress what I felt, "is it\r\nnonsense when he says that the tassets and cuissards of the enamelled\r\nsuit of armour commonly known as the \'Prince\'s Emblazoned\' can be found\r\namong a mass of rusty theatrical properties, broken stoves and\r\nragpicker\'s refuse in a garret in Pell Street?"\r\n\r\nHawberk\'s hammer fell to the ground, but he picked it up and asked, with\r\na great deal of calm, how I knew that the tassets and left cuissard were\r\nmissing from the "Prince\'s Emblazoned."\r\n\r\n"I did not know until Mr. Wilde mentioned it to me the other day. He said\r\nthey were in the garret of 998 Pell Street."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense," he cried, but I noticed his hand trembling under his leathern\r\napron.\r\n\r\n"Is this nonsense too?" I asked pleasantly, "is it nonsense when Mr.\r\nWilde continually speaks of you as the Marquis of Avonshire and of Miss\r\nConstance--"\r\n\r\nI did not finish, for Constance had started to her feet with terror\r\nwritten on every feature. Hawberk looked at me and slowly smoothed his\r\nleathern apron.\r\n\r\n"That is impossible," he observed, "Mr. Wilde may know a great many\r\nthings--"\r\n\r\n"About armour, for instance, and the \'Prince\'s Emblazoned,\'" I\r\ninterposed, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he continued, slowly, "about armour also--may be--but he is wrong\r\nin regard to the Marquis of Avonshire, who, as you know, killed his\r\nwife\'s traducer years ago, and went to Australia where he did not long\r\nsurvive his wife."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Wilde is wrong," murmured Constance. Her lips were blanched, but her\r\nvoice was sweet and calm.\r\n\r\n"Let us agree, if you please, that in this one circumstance Mr. Wilde is\r\nwrong," I said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nI climbed the three dilapidated flights of stairs, which I had so often\r\nclimbed before, and knocked at a small door at the end of the corridor.\r\nMr. Wilde opened the door and I walked in.\r\n\r\nWhen he had double-locked the door and pushed a heavy chest against it,\r\nhe came and sat down beside me, peering up into my face with his little\r\nlight-coloured eyes. Half a dozen new scratches covered his nose and\r\ncheeks, and the silver wires which supported his artificial ears had\r\nbecome displaced. I thought I had never seen him so hideously\r\nfascinating. He had no ears. The artificial ones, which now stood out at\r\nan angle from the fine wire, were his one weakness. They were made of wax\r\nand painted a shell pink, but the rest of his face was yellow. He might\r\nbetter have revelled in the luxury of some artificial fingers for his\r\nleft hand, which was absolutely fingerless, but it seemed to cause him no\r\ninconvenience, and he was satisfied with his wax ears. He was very small,\r\nscarcely higher than a child of ten, but his arms were magnificently\r\ndeveloped, and his thighs as thick as any athlete\'s. Still, the most\r\nremarkable thing about Mr. Wilde was that a man of his marvellous\r\nintelligence and knowledge should have such a head. It was flat and\r\npointed, like the heads of many of those unfortunates whom people\r\nimprison in asylums for the weak-minded. Many called him insane, but I\r\nknew him to be as sane as I was.\r\n\r\nI do not deny that he was eccentric; the mania he had for keeping that\r\ncat and teasing her until she flew at his face like a demon, was\r\ncertainly eccentric. I never could understand why he kept the creature,\r\nnor what pleasure he found in shutting himself up in his room with this\r\nsurly, vicious beast. I remember once, glancing up from the manuscript I\r\nwas studying by the light of some tallow dips, and seeing Mr. Wilde\r\nsquatting motionless on his high chair, his eyes fairly blazing with\r\nexcitement, while the cat, which had risen from her place before the\r\nstove, came creeping across the floor right at him. Before I could move\r\nshe flattened her belly to the ground, crouched, trembled, and sprang\r\ninto his face. Howling and foaming they rolled over and over on the\r\nfloor, scratching and clawing, until the cat screamed and fled under the\r\ncabinet, and Mr. Wilde turned over on his back, his limbs contracting and\r\ncurling up like the legs of a dying spider. He _was_ eccentric.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilde had climbed into his high chair, and, after studying my face,\r\npicked up a dog\'s-eared ledger and opened it.\r\n\r\n"Henry B. Matthews," he read, "book-keeper with Whysot Whysot and\r\nCompany, dealers in church ornaments. Called April 3rd. Reputation\r\ndamaged on the race-track. Known as a welcher. Reputation to be repaired\r\nby August 1st. Retainer Five Dollars." He turned the page and ran his\r\nfingerless knuckles down the closely-written columns.\r\n\r\n"P. Greene Dusenberry, Minister of the Gospel, Fairbeach, New Jersey.\r\nReputation damaged in the Bowery. To be repaired as soon as possible.\r\nRetainer $100."\r\n\r\nHe coughed and added, "Called, April 6th."\r\n\r\n"Then you are not in need of money, Mr. Wilde," I inquired.\r\n\r\n"Listen," he coughed again.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. C. Hamilton Chester, of Chester Park, New York City. Called April\r\n7th. Reputation damaged at Dieppe, France. To be repaired by October 1st\r\nRetainer $500.\r\n\r\n"Note.--C. Hamilton Chester, Captain U.S.S. \'Avalanche\', ordered home\r\nfrom South Sea Squadron October 1st."\r\n\r\n"Well," I said, "the profession of a Repairer of Reputations is\r\nlucrative."\r\n\r\nHis colourless eyes sought mine, "I only wanted to demonstrate that I\r\nwas correct. You said it was impossible to succeed as a Repairer of\r\nReputations; that even if I did succeed in certain cases it would cost\r\nme more than I would gain by it. To-day I have five hundred men in my\r\nemploy, who are poorly paid, but who pursue the work with an enthusiasm\r\nwhich possibly may be born of fear. These men enter every shade and grade\r\nof society; some even are pillars of the most exclusive social temples;\r\nothers are the prop and pride of the financial world; still others, hold\r\nundisputed sway among the \'Fancy and the Talent.\' I choose them at my\r\nleisure from those who reply to my advertisements. It is easy enough,\r\nthey are all cowards. I could treble the number in twenty days if I\r\nwished. So you see, those who have in their keeping the reputations of\r\ntheir fellow-citizens, I have in my pay."\r\n\r\n"They may turn on you," I suggested.\r\n\r\nHe rubbed his thumb over his cropped ears, and adjusted the wax\r\nsubstitutes. "I think not," he murmured thoughtfully, "I seldom have to\r\napply the whip, and then only once. Besides they like their wages."\r\n\r\n"How do you apply the whip?" I demanded.\r\n\r\nHis face for a moment was awful to look upon. His eyes dwindled to a pair\r\nof green sparks.\r\n\r\n"I invite them to come and have a little chat with me," he said in a soft\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nA knock at the door interrupted him, and his face resumed its amiable\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n"Who is it?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Steylette," was the answer.\r\n\r\n"Come to-morrow," replied Mr. Wilde.\r\n\r\n"Impossible," began the other, but was silenced by a sort of bark from\r\nMr. Wilde.\r\n\r\n"Come to-morrow," he repeated.\r\n\r\nWe heard somebody move away from the door and turn the corner by the\r\nstairway.\r\n\r\n"Who is that?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Arnold Steylette, Owner and Editor in Chief of the great New York\r\ndaily."\r\n\r\nHe drummed on the ledger with his fingerless hand adding: "I pay him very\r\nbadly, but he thinks it a good bargain."\r\n\r\n"Arnold Steylette!" I repeated amazed.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mr. Wilde, with a self-satisfied cough.\r\n\r\nThe cat, which had entered the room as he spoke, hesitated, looked up at\r\nhim and snarled. He climbed down from the chair and squatting on the\r\nfloor, took the creature into his arms and caressed her. The cat ceased\r\nsnarling and presently began a loud purring which seemed to increase in\r\ntimbre as he stroked her. "Where are the notes?" I asked. He pointed to\r\nthe table, and for the hundredth time I picked up the bundle of\r\nmanuscript entitled--\r\n\r\n"THE IMPERIAL DYNASTY OF AMERICA."\r\n\r\nOne by one I studied the well-worn pages, worn only by my own handling,\r\nand although I knew all by heart, from the beginning, "When from Carcosa,\r\nthe Hyades, Hastur, and Aldebaran," to "Castaigne, Louis de Calvados,\r\nborn December 19th, 1877," I read it with an eager, rapt attention,\r\npausing to repeat parts of it aloud, and dwelling especially on "Hildred\r\nde Calvados, only son of Hildred Castaigne and Edythe Landes Castaigne,\r\nfirst in succession," etc., etc.\r\n\r\nWhen I finished, Mr. Wilde nodded and coughed.\r\n\r\n"Speaking of your legitimate ambition," he said, "how do Constance and\r\nLouis get along?"\r\n\r\n"She loves him," I replied simply.\r\n\r\nThe cat on his knee suddenly turned and struck at his eyes, and he flung\r\nher off and climbed on to the chair opposite me.\r\n\r\n"And Dr. Archer! But that\'s a matter you can settle any time you wish,"\r\nhe added.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I replied, "Dr. Archer can wait, but it is time I saw my cousin\r\nLouis."\r\n\r\n"It is time," he repeated. Then he took another ledger from the table and\r\nran over the leaves rapidly. "We are now in communication with ten\r\nthousand men," he muttered. "We can count on one hundred thousand within\r\nthe first twenty-eight hours, and in forty-eight hours the state will\r\nrise _en masse_. The country follows the state, and the portion that\r\nwill not, I mean California and the Northwest, might better never have\r\nbeen inhabited. I shall not send them the Yellow Sign."\r\n\r\nThe blood rushed to my head, but I only answered, "A new broom sweeps\r\nclean."\r\n\r\n"The ambition of Caesar and of Napoleon pales before that which could not\r\nrest until it had seized the minds of men and controlled even their\r\nunborn thoughts," said Mr. Wilde.\r\n\r\n"You are speaking of the King in Yellow," I groaned, with a shudder.\r\n\r\n"He is a king whom emperors have served."\r\n\r\n"I am content to serve him," I replied.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilde sat rubbing his ears with his crippled hand. "Perhaps Constance\r\ndoes not love him," he suggested.\r\n\r\nI started to reply, but a sudden burst of military music from the street\r\nbelow drowned my voice. The twentieth dragoon regiment, formerly in\r\ngarrison at Mount St. Vincent, was returning from the manoeuvres in\r\nWestchester County, to its new barracks on East Washington Square. It was\r\nmy cousin\'s regiment. They were a fine lot of fellows, in their pale\r\nblue, tight-fitting jackets, jaunty busbys and white riding breeches with\r\nthe double yellow stripe, into which their limbs seemed moulded. Every\r\nother squadron was armed with lances, from the metal points of which\r\nfluttered yellow and white pennons. The band passed, playing the\r\nregimental march, then came the colonel and staff, the horses crowding\r\nand trampling, while their heads bobbed in unison, and the pennons\r\nfluttered from their lance points. The troopers, who rode with the\r\nbeautiful English seat, looked brown as berries from their bloodless\r\ncampaign among the farms of Westchester, and the music of their sabres\r\nagainst the stirrups, and the jingle of spurs and carbines was delightful\r\nto me. I saw Louis riding with his squadron. He was as handsome an\r\nofficer as I have ever seen. Mr. Wilde, who had mounted a chair by the\r\nwindow, saw him too, but said nothing. Louis turned and looked straight\r\nat Hawberk\'s shop as he passed, and I could see the flush on his brown\r\ncheeks. I think Constance must have been at the window. When the last\r\ntroopers had clattered by, and the last pennons vanished into South Fifth\r\nAvenue, Mr. Wilde clambered out of his chair and dragged the chest away\r\nfrom the door.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, "it is time that you saw your cousin Louis."\r\n\r\nHe unlocked the door and I picked up my hat and stick and stepped into\r\nthe corridor. The stairs were dark. Groping about, I set my foot on\r\nsomething soft, which snarled and spit, and I aimed a murderous blow at\r\nthe cat, but my cane shivered to splinters against the balustrade, and\r\nthe beast scurried back into Mr. Wilde\'s room.\r\n\r\nPassing Hawberk\'s door again I saw him still at work on the armour, but\r\nI did not stop, and stepping out into Bleecker Street, I followed it to\r\nWooster, skirted the grounds of the Lethal Chamber, and crossing\r\nWashington Park went straight to my rooms in the Benedick. Here I lunched\r\ncomfortably, read the _Herald_ and the _Meteor_, and finally went\r\nto the steel safe in my bedroom and set the time combination. The\r\nthree and three-quarter minutes which it is necessary to wait, while the\r\ntime lock is opening, are to me golden moments. From the instant I set\r\nthe combination to the moment when I grasp the knobs and swing back\r\nthe solid steel doors, I live in an ecstasy of expectation. Those moments\r\nmust be like moments passed in Paradise. I know what I am to find at\r\nthe end of the time limit. I know what the massive safe holds secure for\r\nme, for me alone, and the exquisite pleasure of waiting is hardly enhanced\r\nwhen the safe opens and I lift, from its velvet crown, a diadem of purest\r\ngold, blazing with diamonds. I do this every day, and yet the joy of\r\nwaiting and at last touching again the diadem, only seems to increase as\r\nthe days pass. It is a diadem fit for a King among kings, an Emperor\r\namong emperors. The King in Yellow might scorn it, but it shall be worn\r\nby his royal servant.\r\n\r\nI held it in my arms until the alarm in the safe rang harshly, and then\r\ntenderly, proudly, I replaced it and shut the steel doors. I walked\r\nslowly back into my study, which faces Washington Square, and leaned on\r\nthe window sill. The afternoon sun poured into my windows, and a gentle\r\nbreeze stirred the branches of the elms and maples in the park, now\r\ncovered with buds and tender foliage. A flock of pigeons circled about\r\nthe tower of the Memorial Church; sometimes alighting on the purple tiled\r\nroof, sometimes wheeling downward to the lotos fountain in front of the\r\nmarble arch. The gardeners were busy with the flower beds around the\r\nfountain, and the freshly turned earth smelled sweet and spicy. A lawn\r\nmower, drawn by a fat white horse, clinked across the green sward, and\r\nwatering-carts poured showers of spray over the asphalt drives. Around\r\nthe statue of Peter Stuyvesant, which in 1897 had replaced the\r\nmonstrosity supposed to represent Garibaldi, children played in the\r\nspring sunshine, and nurse girls wheeled elaborate baby carriages with a\r\nreckless disregard for the pasty-faced occupants, which could probably be\r\nexplained by the presence of half a dozen trim dragoon troopers languidly\r\nlolling on the benches. Through the trees, the Washington Memorial Arch\r\nglistened like silver in the sunshine, and beyond, on the eastern\r\nextremity of the square the grey stone barracks of the dragoons, and the\r\nwhite granite artillery stables were alive with colour and motion.\r\n\r\nI looked at the Lethal Chamber on the corner of the square opposite. A\r\nfew curious people still lingered about the gilded iron railing, but\r\ninside the grounds the paths were deserted. I watched the fountains\r\nripple and sparkle; the sparrows had already found this new bathing nook,\r\nand the basins were covered with the dusty-feathered little things. Two\r\nor three white peacocks picked their way across the lawns, and a drab\r\ncoloured pigeon sat so motionless on the arm of one of the "Fates," that\r\nit seemed to be a part of the sculptured stone.\r\n\r\nAs I was turning carelessly away, a slight commotion in the group of\r\ncurious loiterers around the gates attracted my attention. A young man\r\nhad entered, and was advancing with nervous strides along the gravel path\r\nwhich leads to the bronze doors of the Lethal Chamber. He paused a moment\r\nbefore the "Fates," and as he raised his head to those three mysterious\r\nfaces, the pigeon rose from its sculptured perch, circled about for a\r\nmoment and wheeled to the east. The young man pressed his hand to his\r\nface, and then with an undefinable gesture sprang up the marble steps,\r\nthe bronze doors closed behind him, and half an hour later the loiterers\r\nslouched away, and the frightened pigeon returned to its perch in the\r\narms of Fate.\r\n\r\nI put on my hat and went out into the park for a little walk before\r\ndinner. As I crossed the central driveway a group of officers passed, and\r\none of them called out, "Hello, Hildred," and came back to shake hands\r\nwith me. It was my cousin Louis, who stood smiling and tapping his\r\nspurred heels with his riding-whip.\r\n\r\n"Just back from Westchester," he said; "been doing the bucolic; milk and\r\ncurds, you know, dairy-maids in sunbonnets, who say \'haeow\' and \'I don\'t\r\nthink\' when you tell them they are pretty. I\'m nearly dead for a square\r\nmeal at Delmonico\'s. What\'s the news?"\r\n\r\n"There is none," I replied pleasantly. "I saw your regiment coming in this\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\n"Did you? I didn\'t see you. Where were you?"\r\n\r\n"In Mr. Wilde\'s window."\r\n\r\n"Oh, hell!" he began impatiently, "that man is stark mad! I don\'t\r\nunderstand why you--"\r\n\r\nHe saw how annoyed I felt by this outburst, and begged my pardon.\r\n\r\n"Really, old chap," he said, "I don\'t mean to run down a man you like,\r\nbut for the life of me I can\'t see what the deuce you find in common with\r\nMr. Wilde. He\'s not well bred, to put it generously; he is hideously\r\ndeformed; his head is the head of a criminally insane person. You know\r\nyourself he\'s been in an asylum--"\r\n\r\n"So have I," I interrupted calmly.\r\n\r\nLouis looked startled and confused for a moment, but recovered and\r\nslapped me heartily on the shoulder. "You were completely cured," he\r\nbegan; but I stopped him again.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you mean that I was simply acknowledged never to have been\r\ninsane."\r\n\r\n"Of course that--that\'s what I meant," he laughed.\r\n\r\nI disliked his laugh because I knew it was forced, but I nodded gaily and\r\nasked him where he was going. Louis looked after his brother officers who\r\nhad now almost reached Broadway.\r\n\r\n"We had intended to sample a Brunswick cocktail, but to tell you the\r\ntruth I was anxious for an excuse to go and see Hawberk instead. Come\r\nalong, I\'ll make you my excuse."\r\n\r\nWe found old Hawberk, neatly attired in a fresh spring suit, standing at\r\nthe door of his shop and sniffing the air.\r\n\r\n"I had just decided to take Constance for a little stroll before dinner,"\r\nhe replied to the impetuous volley of questions from Louis. "We thought\r\nof walking on the park terrace along the North River."\r\n\r\nAt that moment Constance appeared and grew pale and rosy by turns as\r\nLouis bent over her small gloved fingers. I tried to excuse myself,\r\nalleging an engagement uptown, but Louis and Constance would not listen,\r\nand I saw I was expected to remain and engage old Hawberk\'s attention.\r\nAfter all it would be just as well if I kept my eye on Louis, I thought,\r\nand when they hailed a Spring Street horse-car, I got in after them and\r\ntook my seat beside the armourer.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful line of parks and granite terraces overlooking the wharves\r\nalong the North River, which were built in 1910 and finished in the\r\nautumn of 1917, had become one of the most popular promenades in the\r\nmetropolis. They extended from the battery to 190th Street, overlooking\r\nthe noble river and affording a fine view of the Jersey shore and the\r\nHighlands opposite. Cafes and restaurants were scattered here and there\r\namong the trees, and twice a week military bands from the garrison played\r\nin the kiosques on the parapets.\r\n\r\nWe sat down in the sunshine on the bench at the foot of the equestrian\r\nstatue of General Sheridan. Constance tipped her sunshade to shield her\r\neyes, and she and Louis began a murmuring conversation which was\r\nimpossible to catch. Old Hawberk, leaning on his ivory headed cane,\r\nlighted an excellent cigar, the mate to which I politely refused, and\r\nsmiled at vacancy. The sun hung low above the Staten Island woods, and\r\nthe bay was dyed with golden hues reflected from the sun-warmed sails of\r\nthe shipping in the harbour.\r\n\r\nBrigs, schooners, yachts, clumsy ferry-boats, their decks swarming with\r\npeople, railroad transports carrying lines of brown, blue and white\r\nfreight cars, stately sound steamers, declasse tramp steamers, coasters,\r\ndredgers, scows, and everywhere pervading the entire bay impudent little\r\ntugs puffing and whistling officiously;--these were the craft which\r\nchurned the sunlight waters as far as the eye could reach. In calm\r\ncontrast to the hurry of sailing vessel and steamer a silent fleet of\r\nwhite warships lay motionless in midstream.\r\n\r\nConstance\'s merry laugh aroused me from my reverie.\r\n\r\n"What _are_ you staring at?" she inquired.\r\n\r\n"Nothing--the fleet," I smiled.\r\n\r\nThen Louis told us what the vessels were, pointing out each by its\r\nrelative position to the old Red Fort on Governor\'s Island.\r\n\r\n"That little cigar shaped thing is a torpedo boat," he explained; "there\r\nare four more lying close together. They are the _Tarpon_, the _Falcon_,\r\nthe _Sea Fox_, and the _Octopus_. The gun-boats just above are the\r\n_Princeton_, the _Champlain_, the _Still Water_ and the _Erie_. Next to\r\nthem lie the cruisers _Faragut_ and _Los Angeles_, and above them the\r\nbattle ships _California_, and _Dakota_, and the _Washington_ which is\r\nthe flag ship. Those two squatty looking chunks of metal which are\r\nanchored there off Castle William are the double turreted monitors\r\n_Terrible_ and _Magnificent_; behind them lies the ram, _Osceola_."\r\n\r\nConstance looked at him with deep approval in her beautiful eyes. "What\r\nloads of things you know for a soldier," she said, and we all joined in\r\nthe laugh which followed.\r\n\r\nPresently Louis rose with a nod to us and offered his arm to Constance,\r\nand they strolled away along the river wall. Hawberk watched them for a\r\nmoment and then turned to me.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Wilde was right," he said. "I have found the missing tassets and\r\nleft cuissard of the \'Prince\'s Emblazoned,\' in a vile old junk garret in\r\nPell Street."\r\n\r\n"998?" I inquired, with a smile.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Wilde is a very intelligent man," I observed.\r\n\r\n"I want to give him the credit of this most important discovery,"\r\ncontinued Hawberk. "And I intend it shall be known that he is entitled\r\nto the fame of it."\r\n\r\n"He won\'t thank you for that," I answered sharply; "please say nothing\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\n"Do you know what it is worth?" said Hawberk.\r\n\r\n"No, fifty dollars, perhaps."\r\n\r\n"It is valued at five hundred, but the owner of the \'Prince\'s Emblazoned\'\r\nwill give two thousand dollars to the person who completes his suit; that\r\nreward also belongs to Mr. Wilde."\r\n\r\n"He doesn\'t want it! He refuses it!" I answered angrily. "What do you\r\nknow about Mr. Wilde? He doesn\'t need the money. He is rich--or will\r\nbe--richer than any living man except myself. What will we care for money\r\nthen--what will we care, he and I, when--when--"\r\n\r\n"When what?" demanded Hawberk, astonished.\r\n\r\n"You will see," I replied, on my guard again.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me narrowly, much as Doctor Archer used to, and I knew he\r\nthought I was mentally unsound. Perhaps it was fortunate for him that he\r\ndid not use the word lunatic just then.\r\n\r\n"No," I replied to his unspoken thought, "I am not mentally weak; my mind\r\nis as healthy as Mr. Wilde\'s. I do not care to explain just yet what I\r\nhave on hand, but it is an investment which will pay more than mere gold,\r\nsilver and precious stones. It will secure the happiness and prosperity\r\nof a continent--yes, a hemisphere!"\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Hawberk.\r\n\r\n"And eventually," I continued more quietly, "it will secure the happiness\r\nof the whole world."\r\n\r\n"And incidentally your own happiness and prosperity as well as Mr.\r\nWilde\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly," I smiled. But I could have throttled him for taking that tone.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me in silence for a while and then said very gently, "Why\r\ndon\'t you give up your books and studies, Mr. Castaigne, and take a tramp\r\namong the mountains somewhere or other? You used to be fond of fishing.\r\nTake a cast or two at the trout in the Rangelys."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care for fishing any more," I answered, without a shade of\r\nannoyance in my voice.\r\n\r\n"You used to be fond of everything," he continued; "athletics, yachting,\r\nshooting, riding--"\r\n\r\n"I have never cared to ride since my fall," I said quietly.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes, your fall," he repeated, looking away from me.\r\n\r\nI thought this nonsense had gone far enough, so I brought the\r\nconversation back to Mr. Wilde; but he was scanning my face again in a\r\nmanner highly offensive to me.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Wilde," he repeated, "do you know what he did this afternoon? He\r\ncame downstairs and nailed a sign over the hall door next to mine; it\r\nread:\r\n\r\n"MR. WILDE,\r\nREPAIRER OF REPUTATIONS.\r\nThird Bell.\r\n\r\n"Do you know what a Repairer of Reputations can be?"\r\n\r\n"I do," I replied, suppressing the rage within.\r\n\r\n"Oh," he said again.\r\n\r\nLouis and Constance came strolling by and stopped to ask if we would join\r\nthem. Hawberk looked at his watch. At the same moment a puff of smoke\r\nshot from the casemates of Castle William, and the boom of the sunset gun\r\nrolled across the water and was re-echoed from the Highlands opposite.\r\nThe flag came running down from the flag-pole, the bugles sounded on the\r\nwhite decks of the warships, and the first electric light sparkled out\r\nfrom the Jersey shore.\r\n\r\nAs I turned into the city with Hawberk I heard Constance murmur something\r\nto Louis which I did not understand; but Louis whispered "My darling," in\r\nreply; and again, walking ahead with Hawberk through the square I heard a\r\nmurmur of "sweetheart," and "my own Constance," and I knew the time had\r\nnearly arrived when I should speak of important matters with my cousin\r\nLouis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nOne morning early in May I stood before the steel safe in my bedroom,\r\ntrying on the golden jewelled crown. The diamonds flashed fire as I\r\nturned to the mirror, and the heavy beaten gold burned like a halo about\r\nmy head. I remembered Camilla\'s agonized scream and the awful words\r\nechoing through the dim streets of Carcosa. They were the last lines in\r\nthe first act, and I dared not think of what followed--dared not, even\r\nin the spring sunshine, there in my own room, surrounded with familiar\r\nobjects, reassured by the bustle from the street and the voices of the\r\nservants in the hallway outside. For those poisoned words had dropped\r\nslowly into my heart, as death-sweat drops upon a bed-sheet and is\r\nabsorbed. Trembling, I put the diadem from my head and wiped my forehead,\r\nbut I thought of Hastur and of my own rightful ambition, and I remembered\r\nMr. Wilde as I had last left him, his face all torn and bloody from the\r\nclaws of that devil\'s creature, and what he said--ah, what he said. The\r\nalarm bell in the safe began to whirr harshly, and I knew my time was up;\r\nbut I would not heed it, and replacing the flashing circlet upon my head\r\nI turned defiantly to the mirror. I stood for a long time absorbed in the\r\nchanging expression of my own eyes. The mirror reflected a face which was\r\nlike my own, but whiter, and so thin that I hardly recognized it And all\r\nthe time I kept repeating between my clenched teeth, "The day has come!\r\nthe day has come!" while the alarm in the safe whirred and clamoured, and\r\nthe diamonds sparkled and flamed above my brow. I heard a door open but\r\ndid not heed it. It was only when I saw two faces in the mirror:--it was\r\nonly when another face rose over my shoulder, and two other eyes met\r\nmine. I wheeled like a flash and seized a long knife from my\r\ndressing-table, and my cousin sprang back very pale, crying: "Hildred!\r\nfor God\'s sake!" then as my hand fell, he said: "It is I, Louis, don\'t\r\nyou know me?" I stood silent. I could not have spoken for my life. He\r\nwalked up to me and took the knife from my hand.\r\n\r\n"What is all this?" he inquired, in a gentle voice. "Are you ill?"\r\n\r\n"No," I replied. But I doubt if he heard me.\r\n\r\n"Come, come, old fellow," he cried, "take off that brass crown and toddle\r\ninto the study. Are you going to a masquerade? What\'s all this theatrical\r\ntinsel anyway?"\r\n\r\nI was glad he thought the crown was made of brass and paste, yet I didn\'t\r\nlike him any the better for thinking so. I let him take it from my hand,\r\nknowing it was best to humour him. He tossed the splendid diadem in the\r\nair, and catching it, turned to me smiling.\r\n\r\n"It\'s dear at fifty cents," he said. "What\'s it for?"\r\n\r\nI did not answer, but took the circlet from his hands, and placing it in\r\nthe safe shut the massive steel door. The alarm ceased its infernal din\r\nat once. He watched me curiously, but did not seem to notice the sudden\r\nceasing of the alarm. He did, however, speak of the safe as a biscuit\r\nbox. Fearing lest he might examine the combination I led the way into my\r\nstudy. Louis threw himself on the sofa and flicked at flies with his\r\neternal riding-whip. He wore his fatigue uniform with the braided jacket\r\nand jaunty cap, and I noticed that his riding-boots were all splashed\r\nwith red mud.\r\n\r\n"Where have you been?" I inquired.\r\n\r\n"Jumping mud creeks in Jersey," he said. "I haven\'t had time to change\r\nyet; I was rather in a hurry to see you. Haven\'t you got a glass of\r\nsomething? I\'m dead tired; been in the saddle twenty-four hours."\r\n\r\nI gave him some brandy from my medicinal store, which he drank with a\r\ngrimace.\r\n\r\n"Damned bad stuff," he observed. "I\'ll give you an address where they\r\nsell brandy that is brandy."\r\n\r\n"It\'s good enough for my needs," I said indifferently. "I use it to rub\r\nmy chest with." He stared and flicked at another fly.\r\n\r\n"See here, old fellow," he began, "I\'ve got something to suggest to you.\r\nIt\'s four years now that you\'ve shut yourself up here like an owl, never\r\ngoing anywhere, never taking any healthy exercise, never doing a damn\r\nthing but poring over those books up there on the mantelpiece."\r\n\r\nHe glanced along the row of shelves. "Napoleon, Napoleon, Napoleon!" he\r\nread. "For heaven\'s sake, have you nothing but Napoleons there?"\r\n\r\n"I wish they were bound in gold," I said. "But wait, yes, there is\r\nanother book, _The King in Yellow_." I looked him steadily in the\r\neye.\r\n\r\n"Have you never read it?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"I? No, thank God! I don\'t want to be driven crazy."\r\n\r\nI saw he regretted his speech as soon as he had uttered it. There is only\r\none word which I loathe more than I do lunatic and that word is crazy.\r\nBut I controlled myself and asked him why he thought _The King in\r\nYellow_ dangerous.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know," he said, hastily. "I only remember the excitement it\r\ncreated and the denunciations from pulpit and Press. I believe the author\r\nshot himself after bringing forth this monstrosity, didn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"I understand he is still alive," I answered.\r\n\r\n"That\'s probably true," he muttered; "bullets couldn\'t kill a fiend like\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"It is a book of great truths," I said.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he replied, "of \'truths\' which send men frantic and blast their\r\nlives. I don\'t care if the thing is, as they say, the very supreme\r\nessence of art. It\'s a crime to have written it, and I for one shall\r\nnever open its pages."\r\n\r\n"Is that what you have come to tell me?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"No," he said, "I came to tell you that I am going to be married."\r\n\r\nI believe for a moment my heart ceased to beat, but I kept my eyes on his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he continued, smiling happily, "married to the sweetest girl on\r\nearth."\r\n\r\n"Constance Hawberk," I said mechanically.\r\n\r\n"How did you know?" he cried, astonished. "I didn\'t know it myself until\r\nthat evening last April, when we strolled down to the embankment before\r\ndinner."\r\n\r\n"When is it to be?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"It was to have been next September, but an hour ago a despatch came\r\nordering our regiment to the Presidio, San Francisco. We leave at noon\r\nto-morrow. To-morrow," he repeated. "Just think, Hildred, to-morrow I\r\nshall be the happiest fellow that ever drew breath in this jolly world,\r\nfor Constance will go with me."\r\n\r\nI offered him my hand in congratulation, and he seized and shook it like\r\nthe good-natured fool he was--or pretended to be.\r\n\r\n"I am going to get my squadron as a wedding present," he rattled on.\r\n"Captain and Mrs. Louis Castaigne, eh, Hildred?"\r\n\r\nThen he told me where it was to be and who were to be there, and made me\r\npromise to come and be best man. I set my teeth and listened to his\r\nboyish chatter without showing what I felt, but--\r\n\r\nI was getting to the limit of my endurance, and when he jumped up, and,\r\nswitching his spurs till they jingled, said he must go, I did not detain\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"There\'s one thing I want to ask of you," I said quietly.\r\n\r\n"Out with it, it\'s promised," he laughed.\r\n\r\n"I want you to meet me for a quarter of an hour\'s talk to-night."\r\n\r\n"Of course, if you wish," he said, somewhat puzzled. "Where?"\r\n\r\n"Anywhere, in the park there."\r\n\r\n"What time, Hildred?"\r\n\r\n"Midnight."\r\n\r\n"What in the name of--" he began, but checked himself and laughingly\r\nassented. I watched him go down the stairs and hurry away, his sabre\r\nbanging at every stride. He turned into Bleecker Street, and I knew he\r\nwas going to see Constance. I gave him ten minutes to disappear and then\r\nfollowed in his footsteps, taking with me the jewelled crown and the\r\nsilken robe embroidered with the Yellow Sign. When I turned into Bleecker\r\nStreet, and entered the doorway which bore the sign--\r\n\r\nMR. WILDE,\r\nREPAIRER OF REPUTATIONS.\r\nThird Bell.\r\n\r\nI saw old Hawberk moving about in his shop, and imagined I heard\r\nConstance\'s voice in the parlour; but I avoided them both and hurried up\r\nthe trembling stairways to Mr. Wilde\'s apartment. I knocked and entered\r\nwithout ceremony. Mr. Wilde lay groaning on the floor, his face covered\r\nwith blood, his clothes torn to shreds. Drops of blood were scattered\r\nabout over the carpet, which had also been ripped and frayed in the\r\nevidently recent struggle.\r\n\r\n"It\'s that cursed cat," he said, ceasing his groans, and turning his\r\ncolourless eyes to me; "she attacked me while I was asleep. I believe she\r\nwill kill me yet."\r\n\r\nThis was too much, so I went into the kitchen, and, seizing a hatchet\r\nfrom the pantry, started to find the infernal beast and settle her then\r\nand there. My search was fruitless, and after a while I gave it up and\r\ncame back to find Mr. Wilde squatting on his high chair by the table. He\r\nhad washed his face and changed his clothes. The great furrows which the\r\ncat\'s claws had ploughed up in his face he had filled with collodion, and\r\na rag hid the wound in his throat. I told him I should kill the cat when\r\nI came across her, but he only shook his head and turned to the open\r\nledger before him. He read name after name of the people who had come to\r\nhim in regard to their reputation, and the sums he had amassed were\r\nstartling.\r\n\r\n"I put on the screws now and then," he explained.\r\n\r\n"One day or other some of these people will assassinate you," I insisted.\r\n\r\n"Do you think so?" he said, rubbing his mutilated ears.\r\n\r\nIt was useless to argue with him, so I took down the manuscript entitled\r\nImperial Dynasty of America, for the last time I should ever take it down\r\nin Mr. Wilde\'s study. I read it through, thrilling and trembling with\r\npleasure. When I had finished Mr. Wilde took the manuscript and, turning\r\nto the dark passage which leads from his study to his bed-chamber,\r\ncalled out in a loud voice, "Vance." Then for the first time, I noticed a\r\nman crouching there in the shadow. How I had overlooked him during my\r\nsearch for the cat, I cannot imagine.\r\n\r\n"Vance, come in," cried Mr. Wilde.\r\n\r\nThe figure rose and crept towards us, and I shall never forget the face\r\nthat he raised to mine, as the light from the window illuminated it.\r\n\r\n"Vance, this is Mr. Castaigne," said Mr. Wilde. Before he had finished\r\nspeaking, the man threw himself on the ground before the table, crying\r\nand grasping, "Oh, God! Oh, my God! Help me! Forgive me! Oh, Mr.\r\nCastaigne, keep that man away. You cannot, you cannot mean it! You are\r\ndifferent--save me! I am broken down--I was in a madhouse and now--when\r\nall was coming right--when I had forgotten the King--the King in Yellow\r\nand--but I shall go mad again--I shall go mad--"\r\n\r\nHis voice died into a choking rattle, for Mr. Wilde had leapt on him and\r\nhis right hand encircled the man\'s throat. When Vance fell in a heap on\r\nthe floor, Mr. Wilde clambered nimbly into his chair again, and rubbing\r\nhis mangled ears with the stump of his hand, turned to me and asked me\r\nfor the ledger. I reached it down from the shelf and he opened it. After\r\na moment\'s searching among the beautifully written pages, he coughed\r\ncomplacently, and pointed to the name Vance.\r\n\r\n"Vance," he read aloud, "Osgood Oswald Vance." At the sound of his name,\r\nthe man on the floor raised his head and turned a convulsed face to Mr.\r\nWilde. His eyes were injected with blood, his lips tumefied. "Called\r\nApril 28th," continued Mr. Wilde. "Occupation, cashier in the Seaforth\r\nNational Bank; has served a term of forgery at Sing Sing, from whence he\r\nwas transferred to the Asylum for the Criminal Insane. Pardoned by the\r\nGovernor of New York, and discharged from the Asylum, January 19, 1918.\r\nReputation damaged at Sheepshead Bay. Rumours that he lives beyond his\r\nincome. Reputation to be repaired at once. Retainer $1,500.\r\n\r\n"Note.--Has embezzled sums amounting to $30,000 since March 20, 1919,\r\nexcellent family, and secured present position through uncle\'s influence.\r\nFather, President of Seaforth Bank."\r\n\r\nI looked at the man on the floor.\r\n\r\n"Get up, Vance," said Mr. Wilde in a gentle voice. Vance rose as if\r\nhypnotized. "He will do as we suggest now," observed Mr. Wilde, and\r\nopening the manuscript, he read the entire history of the Imperial\r\nDynasty of America. Then in a kind and soothing murmur he ran over the\r\nimportant points with Vance, who stood like one stunned. His eyes were so\r\nblank and vacant that I imagined he had become half-witted, and remarked\r\nit to Mr. Wilde who replied that it was of no consequence anyway. Very\r\npatiently we pointed out to Vance what his share in the affair would be,\r\nand he seemed to understand after a while. Mr. Wilde explained the\r\nmanuscript, using several volumes on Heraldry, to substantiate the result\r\nof his researches. He mentioned the establishment of the Dynasty in\r\nCarcosa, the lakes which connected Hastur, Aldebaran and the mystery of\r\nthe Hyades. He spoke of Cassilda and Camilla, and sounded the cloudy\r\ndepths of Demhe, and the Lake of Hali. "The scolloped tatters of the King\r\nin Yellow must hide Yhtill forever," he muttered, but I do not believe\r\nVance heard him. Then by degrees he led Vance along the ramifications of\r\nthe Imperial family, to Uoht and Thale, from Naotalba and Phantom of\r\nTruth, to Aldones, and then tossing aside his manuscript and notes, he\r\nbegan the wonderful story of the Last King. Fascinated and thrilled I\r\nwatched him. He threw up his head, his long arms were stretched out in a\r\nmagnificent gesture of pride and power, and his eyes blazed deep in their\r\nsockets like two emeralds. Vance listened stupefied. As for me, when at\r\nlast Mr. Wilde had finished, and pointing to me, cried, "The cousin of\r\nthe King!" my head swam with excitement.\r\n\r\nControlling myself with a superhuman effort, I explained to Vance why I\r\nalone was worthy of the crown and why my cousin must be exiled or die.\r\nI made him understand that my cousin must never marry, even after\r\nrenouncing all his claims, and how that least of all he should marry the\r\ndaughter of the Marquis of Avonshire and bring England into the question.\r\nI showed him a list of thousands of names which Mr. Wilde had drawn up;\r\nevery man whose name was there had received the Yellow Sign which no\r\nliving human being dared disregard. The city, the state, the whole land,\r\nwere ready to rise and tremble before the Pallid Mask.\r\n\r\nThe time had come, the people should know the son of Hastur, and the\r\nwhole world bow to the black stars which hang in the sky over Carcosa.\r\n\r\nVance leaned on the table, his head buried in his hands. Mr. Wilde drew\r\na rough sketch on the margin of yesterday\'s _Herald_ with a bit of\r\nlead pencil. It was a plan of Hawberk\'s rooms. Then he wrote out the\r\norder and affixed the seal, and shaking like a palsied man I signed my\r\nfirst writ of execution with my name Hildred-Rex.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilde clambered to the floor and unlocking the cabinet, took a long\r\nsquare box from the first shelf. This he brought to the table and opened.\r\nA new knife lay in the tissue paper inside and I picked it up and handed\r\nit to Vance, along with the order and the plan of Hawberk\'s apartment.\r\nThen Mr. Wilde told Vance he could go; and he went, shambling like an\r\noutcast of the slums.\r\n\r\nI sat for a while watching the daylight fade behind the square tower of\r\nthe Judson Memorial Church, and finally, gathering up the manuscript and\r\nnotes, took my hat and started for the door.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilde watched me in silence. When I had stepped into the hall I\r\nlooked back. Mr. Wilde\'s small eyes were still fixed on me. Behind him,\r\nthe shadows gathered in the fading light. Then I closed the door behind\r\nme and went out into the darkening streets.\r\n\r\nI had eaten nothing since breakfast, but I was not hungry. A wretched,\r\nhalf-starved creature, who stood looking across the street at the Lethal\r\nChamber, noticed me and came up to tell me a tale of misery. I gave him\r\nmoney, I don\'t know why, and he went away without thanking me. An\r\nhour later another outcast approached and whined his story. I had a blank\r\nbit of paper in my pocket, on which was traced the Yellow Sign, and I\r\nhanded it to him. He looked at it stupidly for a moment, and then with an\r\nuncertain glance at me, folded it with what seemed to me exaggerated care\r\nand placed it in his bosom.\r\n\r\nThe electric lights were sparkling among the trees, and the new moon\r\nshone in the sky above the Lethal Chamber. It was tiresome waiting in the\r\nsquare; I wandered from the Marble Arch to the artillery stables and back\r\nagain to the lotos fountain. The flowers and grass exhaled a fragrance\r\nwhich troubled me. The jet of the fountain played in the moonlight, and\r\nthe musical splash of falling drops reminded me of the tinkle of chained\r\nmail in Hawberk\'s shop. But it was not so fascinating, and the dull\r\nsparkle of the moonlight on the water brought no such sensations of\r\nexquisite pleasure, as when the sunshine played over the polished steel\r\nof a corselet on Hawberk\'s knee. I watched the bats darting and turning\r\nabove the water plants in the fountain basin, but their rapid, jerky\r\nflight set my nerves on edge, and I went away again to walk aimlessly to\r\nand fro among the trees.\r\n\r\nThe artillery stables were dark, but in the cavalry barracks the\r\nofficers\' windows were brilliantly lighted, and the sallyport was\r\nconstantly filled with troopers in fatigue, carrying straw and harness\r\nand baskets filled with tin dishes.\r\n\r\nTwice the mounted sentry at the gates was changed while I wandered up and\r\ndown the asphalt walk. I looked at my watch. It was nearly time. The\r\nlights in the barracks went out one by one, the barred gate was closed,\r\nand every minute or two an officer passed in through the side wicket,\r\nleaving a rattle of accoutrements and a jingle of spurs on the night air.\r\nThe square had become very silent. The last homeless loiterer had been\r\ndriven away by the grey-coated park policeman, the car tracks along\r\nWooster Street were deserted, and the only sound which broke the\r\nstillness was the stamping of the sentry\'s horse and the ring of his\r\nsabre against the saddle pommel. In the barracks, the officers\' quarters\r\nwere still lighted, and military servants passed and repassed before the\r\nbay windows. Twelve o\'clock sounded from the new spire of St. Francis\r\nXavier, and at the last stroke of the sad-toned bell a figure passed\r\nthrough the wicket beside the portcullis, returned the salute of the\r\nsentry, and crossing the street entered the square and advanced toward\r\nthe Benedick apartment house.\r\n\r\n"Louis," I called.\r\n\r\nThe man pivoted on his spurred heels and came straight toward me.\r\n\r\n"Is that you, Hildred?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you are on time."\r\n\r\nI took his offered hand, and we strolled toward the Lethal Chamber.\r\n\r\nHe rattled on about his wedding and the graces of Constance, and their\r\nfuture prospects, calling my attention to his captain\'s shoulder-straps,\r\nand the triple gold arabesque on his sleeve and fatigue cap. I believe I\r\nlistened as much to the music of his spurs and sabre as I did to his\r\nboyish babble, and at last we stood under the elms on the Fourth Street\r\ncorner of the square opposite the Lethal Chamber. Then he laughed and\r\nasked me what I wanted with him. I motioned him to a seat on a bench\r\nunder the electric light, and sat down beside him. He looked at me\r\ncuriously, with that same searching glance which I hate and fear so in\r\ndoctors. I felt the insult of his look, but he did not know it, and I\r\ncarefully concealed my feelings.\r\n\r\n"Well, old chap," he inquired, "what can I do for you?"\r\n\r\nI drew from my pocket the manuscript and notes of the Imperial Dynasty\r\nof America, and looking him in the eye said:\r\n\r\n"I will tell you. On your word as a soldier, promise me to read this\r\nmanuscript from beginning to end, without asking me a question. Promise\r\nme to read these notes in the same way, and promise me to listen to what\r\nI have to tell later."\r\n\r\n"I promise, if you wish it," he said pleasantly. "Give me the paper,\r\nHildred."\r\n\r\nHe began to read, raising his eyebrows with a puzzled, whimsical air,\r\nwhich made me tremble with suppressed anger. As he advanced his, eyebrows\r\ncontracted, and his lips seemed to form the word "rubbish."\r\n\r\nThen he looked slightly bored, but apparently for my sake read, with an\r\nattempt at interest, which presently ceased to be an effort He started\r\nwhen in the closely written pages he came to his own name, and when he\r\ncame to mine he lowered the paper, and looked sharply at me for a moment\r\nBut he kept his word, and resumed his reading, and I let the half-formed\r\nquestion die on his lips unanswered. When he came to the end and read the\r\nsignature of Mr. Wilde, he folded the paper carefully and returned it to\r\nme. I handed him the notes, and he settled back, pushing his fatigue cap\r\nup to his forehead, with a boyish gesture, which I remembered so well in\r\nschool. I watched his face as he read, and when he finished I took the\r\nnotes with the manuscript, and placed them in my pocket. Then I unfolded\r\na scroll marked with the Yellow Sign. He saw the sign, but he did not\r\nseem to recognize it, and I called his attention to it somewhat sharply.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said, "I see it. What is it?"\r\n\r\n"It is the Yellow Sign," I said angrily.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s it, is it?" said Louis, in that flattering voice, which\r\nDoctor Archer used to employ with me, and would probably have employed\r\nagain, had I not settled his affair for him.\r\n\r\nI kept my rage down and answered as steadily as possible, "Listen, you\r\nhave engaged your word?"\r\n\r\n"I am listening, old chap," he replied soothingly.\r\n\r\nI began to speak very calmly.\r\n\r\n"Dr. Archer, having by some means become possessed of the secret of the\r\nImperial Succession, attempted to deprive me of my right, alleging that\r\nbecause of a fall from my horse four years ago, I had become mentally\r\ndeficient. He presumed to place me under restraint in his own house in\r\nhopes of either driving me insane or poisoning me. I have not forgotten\r\nit. I visited him last night and the interview was final."\r\n\r\nLouis turned quite pale, but did not move. I resumed triumphantly, "There\r\nare yet three people to be interviewed in the interests of Mr. Wilde and\r\nmyself. They are my cousin Louis, Mr. Hawberk, and his daughter\r\nConstance."\r\n\r\nLouis sprang to his feet and I arose also, and flung the paper marked\r\nwith the Yellow Sign to the ground.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t need that to tell you what I have to say," I cried, with a\r\nlaugh of triumph. "You must renounce the crown to me, do you hear, to\r\n_me_."\r\n\r\nLouis looked at me with a startled air, but recovering himself said\r\nkindly, "Of course I renounce the--what is it I must renounce?"\r\n\r\n"The crown," I said angrily.\r\n\r\n"Of course," he answered, "I renounce it. Come, old chap, I\'ll walk back\r\nto your rooms with you."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t try any of your doctor\'s tricks on me," I cried, trembling with\r\nfury. "Don\'t act as if you think I am insane."\r\n\r\n"What nonsense," he replied. "Come, it\'s getting late, Hildred."\r\n\r\n"No," I shouted, "you must listen. You cannot marry, I forbid it. Do you\r\nhear? I forbid it. You shall renounce the crown, and in reward I grant\r\nyou exile, but if you refuse you shall die."\r\n\r\nHe tried to calm me, but I was roused at last, and drawing my long knife\r\nbarred his way.\r\n\r\nThen I told him how they would find Dr. Archer in the cellar with his\r\nthroat open, and I laughed in his face when I thought of Vance and his\r\nknife, and the order signed by me.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you are the King," I cried, "but I shall be King. Who are you to\r\nkeep me from Empire over all the habitable earth! I was born the cousin\r\nof a king, but I shall be King!"\r\n\r\nLouis stood white and rigid before me. Suddenly a man came running up\r\nFourth Street, entered the gate of the Lethal Temple, traversed the path\r\nto the bronze doors at full speed, and plunged into the death chamber\r\nwith the cry of one demented, and I laughed until I wept tears, for I had\r\nrecognized Vance, and knew that Hawberk and his daughter were no longer\r\nin my way.\r\n\r\n"Go," I cried to Louis, "you have ceased to be a menace. You will never\r\nmarry Constance now, and if you marry any one else in your exile, I will\r\nvisit you as I did my doctor last night. Mr. Wilde takes charge of you\r\nto-morrow." Then I turned and darted into South Fifth Avenue, and with a\r\ncry of terror Louis dropped his belt and sabre and followed me like the\r\nwind. I heard him close behind me at the corner of Bleecker Street, and I\r\ndashed into the doorway under Hawberk\'s sign. He cried, "Halt, or I\r\nfire!" but when he saw that I flew up the stairs leaving Hawberk\'s shop\r\nbelow, he left me, and I heard him hammering and shouting at their door\r\nas though it were possible to arouse the dead.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilde\'s door was open, and I entered crying, "It is done, it is done!\r\nLet the nations rise and look upon their King!" but I could not find Mr.\r\nWilde, so I went to the cabinet and took the splendid diadem from its\r\ncase. Then I drew on the white silk robe, embroidered with the Yellow\r\nSign, and placed the crown upon my head. At last I was King, King by my\r\nright in Hastur, King because I knew the mystery of the Hyades, and my\r\nmind had sounded the depths of the Lake of Hali. I was King! The first\r\ngrey pencillings of dawn would raise a tempest which would shake two\r\nhemispheres. Then as I stood, my every nerve pitched to the highest\r\ntension, faint with the joy and splendour of my thought, without, in the\r\ndark passage, a man groaned.\r\n\r\nI seized the tallow dip and sprang to the door. The cat passed me like a\r\ndemon, and the tallow dip went out, but my long knife flew swifter than\r\nshe, and I heard her screech, and I knew that my knife had found her. For\r\na moment I listened to her tumbling and thumping about in the darkness,\r\nand then when her frenzy ceased, I lighted a lamp and raised it over my\r\nhead. Mr. Wilde lay on the floor with his throat torn open. At first I\r\nthought he was dead, but as I looked, a green sparkle came into his\r\nsunken eyes, his mutilated hand trembled, and then a spasm stretched his\r\nmouth from ear to ear. For a moment my terror and despair gave place to\r\nhope, but as I bent over him his eyeballs rolled clean around in his\r\nhead, and he died. Then while I stood, transfixed with rage and despair,\r\nseeing my crown, my empire, every hope and every ambition, my very life,\r\nlying prostrate there with the dead master, _they_ came, seized me\r\nfrom behind, and bound me until my veins stood out like cords, and my\r\nvoice failed with the paroxysms of my frenzied screams. But I still\r\nraged, bleeding and infuriated among them, and more than one policeman\r\nfelt my sharp teeth. Then when I could no longer move they came nearer; I\r\nsaw old Hawberk, and behind him my cousin Louis\' ghastly face, and\r\nfarther away, in the corner, a woman, Constance, weeping softly.\r\n\r\n"Ah! I see it now!" I shrieked. "You have seized the throne and the\r\nempire. Woe! woe to you who are crowned with the crown of the King in\r\nYellow!"\r\n\r\n\r\n[EDITOR\'S NOTE.--Mr. Castaigne died yesterday in the Asylum for Criminal\r\nInsane.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MASK\r\n\r\nCAMILLA: You, sir, should unmask.\r\n\r\nSTRANGER: Indeed?\r\n\r\nCASSILDA: Indeed it\'s time. We all have laid aside disguise but you.\r\n\r\nSTRANGER: I wear no mask.\r\n\r\nCAMILLA: (Terrified, aside to Cassilda.) No mask? No mask!\r\n\r\n_The King in Yellow, Act I, Scene 2_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nAlthough I knew nothing of chemistry, I listened fascinated. He picked up\r\nan Easter lily which Genevieve had brought that morning from Notre Dame,\r\nand dropped it into the basin. Instantly the liquid lost its crystalline\r\nclearness. For a second the lily was enveloped in a milk-white foam,\r\nwhich disappeared, leaving the fluid opalescent. Changing tints of orange\r\nand crimson played over the surface, and then what seemed to be a ray of\r\npure sunlight struck through from the bottom where the lily was resting.\r\nAt the same instant he plunged his hand into the basin and drew out the\r\nflower. "There is no danger," he explained, "if you choose the right\r\nmoment. That golden ray is the signal."\r\n\r\nHe held the lily toward me, and I took it in my hand. It had turned to\r\nstone, to the purest marble.\r\n\r\n"You see," he said, "it is without a flaw. What sculptor could reproduce\r\nit?"\r\n\r\nThe marble was white as snow, but in its depths the veins of the lily\r\nwere tinged with palest azure, and a faint flush lingered deep in its\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t ask me the reason of that," he smiled, noticing my wonder. "I have\r\nno idea why the veins and heart are tinted, but they always are.\r\nYesterday I tried one of Genevieve\'s gold-fish,--there it is."\r\n\r\nThe fish looked as if sculptured in marble. But if you held it to the\r\nlight the stone was beautifully veined with a faint blue, and from\r\nsomewhere within came a rosy light like the tint which slumbers in an\r\nopal. I looked into the basin. Once more it seemed filled with clearest\r\ncrystal.\r\n\r\n"If I should touch it now?" I demanded.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," he replied, "but you had better not try."\r\n\r\n"There is one thing I\'m curious about," I said, "and that is where the\r\nray of sunlight came from."\r\n\r\n"It looked like a sunbeam true enough," he said. "I don\'t know, it always\r\ncomes when I immerse any living thing. Perhaps," he continued, smiling,\r\n"perhaps it is the vital spark of the creature escaping to the source\r\nfrom whence it came."\r\n\r\nI saw he was mocking, and threatened him with a mahl-stick, but he only\r\nlaughed and changed the subject.\r\n\r\n"Stay to lunch. Genevieve will be here directly."\r\n\r\n"I saw her going to early mass," I said, "and she looked as fresh and\r\nsweet as that lily--before you destroyed it."\r\n\r\n"Do you think I destroyed it?" said Boris gravely.\r\n\r\n"Destroyed, preserved, how can we tell?"\r\n\r\nWe sat in the corner of a studio near his unfinished group of the\r\n"Fates." He leaned back on the sofa, twirling a sculptor\'s chisel and\r\nsquinting at his work.\r\n\r\n"By the way," he said, "I have finished pointing up that old academic\r\nAriadne, and I suppose it will have to go to the Salon. It\'s all I have\r\nready this year, but after the success the \'Madonna\' brought me I feel\r\nashamed to send a thing like that."\r\n\r\nThe "Madonna," an exquisite marble for which Genevieve had sat, had been\r\nthe sensation of last year\'s Salon. I looked at the Ariadne. It was a\r\nmagnificent piece of technical work, but I agreed with Boris that the\r\nworld would expect something better of him than that. Still, it was\r\nimpossible now to think of finishing in time for the Salon that splendid\r\nterrible group half shrouded in the marble behind me. The "Fates" would\r\nhave to wait.\r\n\r\nWe were proud of Boris Yvain. We claimed him and he claimed us on the\r\nstrength of his having been born in America, although his father was\r\nFrench and his mother was a Russian. Every one in the Beaux Arts called\r\nhim Boris. And yet there were only two of us whom he addressed in the\r\nsame familiar way--Jack Scott and myself.\r\n\r\nPerhaps my being in love with Genevieve had something to do with his\r\naffection for me. Not that it had ever been acknowledged between us. But\r\nafter all was settled, and she had told me with tears in her eyes that it\r\nwas Boris whom she loved, I went over to his house and congratulated him.\r\nThe perfect cordiality of that interview did not deceive either of us, I\r\nalways believed, although to one at least it was a great comfort. I do\r\nnot think he and Genevieve ever spoke of the matter together, but Boris\r\nknew.\r\n\r\nGenevieve was lovely. The Madonna-like purity of her face might have been\r\ninspired by the Sanctus in Gounod\'s Mass. But I was always glad when she\r\nchanged that mood for what we called her "April Manoeuvres." She was\r\noften as variable as an April day. In the morning grave, dignified and\r\nsweet, at noon laughing, capricious, at evening whatever one least\r\nexpected. I preferred her so rather than in that Madonna-like\r\ntranquillity which stirred the depths of my heart. I was dreaming of\r\nGenevieve when he spoke again.\r\n\r\n"What do you think of my discovery, Alec?"\r\n\r\n"I think it wonderful."\r\n\r\n"I shall make no use of it, you know, beyond satisfying my own curiosity\r\nso far as may be, and the secret will die with me."\r\n\r\n"It would be rather a blow to sculpture, would it not? We painters lose\r\nmore than we ever gain by photography."\r\n\r\nBoris nodded, playing with the edge of the chisel.\r\n\r\n"This new vicious discovery would corrupt the world of art. No, I shall\r\nnever confide the secret to any one," he said slowly.\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to find any one less informed about such phenomena than\r\nmyself; but of course I had heard of mineral springs so saturated with\r\nsilica that the leaves and twigs which fell into them were turned to\r\nstone after a time. I dimly comprehended the process, how the silica\r\nreplaced the vegetable matter, atom by atom, and the result was a\r\nduplicate of the object in stone. This, I confess, had never interested\r\nme greatly, and as for the ancient fossils thus produced, they disgusted\r\nme. Boris, it appeared, feeling curiosity instead of repugnance, had\r\ninvestigated the subject, and had accidentally stumbled on a solution\r\nwhich, attacking the immersed object with a ferocity unheard of, in a\r\nsecond did the work of years. This was all I could make out of the\r\nstrange story he had just been telling me. He spoke again after a long\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n"I am almost frightened when I think what I have found. Scientists would\r\ngo mad over the discovery. It was so simple too; it discovered itself.\r\nWhen I think of that formula, and that new element precipitated in\r\nmetallic scales--"\r\n\r\n"What new element?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I haven\'t thought of naming it, and I don\'t believe I ever shall.\r\nThere are enough precious metals now in the world to cut throats over."\r\n\r\nI pricked up my ears. "Have you struck gold, Boris?"\r\n\r\n"No, better;--but see here, Alec!" he laughed, starting up. "You and I\r\nhave all we need in this world. Ah! how sinister and covetous you look\r\nalready!" I laughed too, and told him I was devoured by the desire for\r\ngold, and we had better talk of something else; so when Genevieve came in\r\nshortly after, we had turned our backs on alchemy.\r\n\r\nGenevieve was dressed in silvery grey from head to foot. The light\r\nglinted along the soft curves of her fair hair as she turned her cheek to\r\nBoris; then she saw me and returned my greeting. She had never before\r\nfailed to blow me a kiss from the tips of her white fingers, and I\r\npromptly complained of the omission. She smiled and held out her hand,\r\nwhich dropped almost before it had touched mine; then she said, looking\r\nat Boris--\r\n\r\n"You must ask Alec to stay for luncheon." This also was something new.\r\nShe had always asked me herself until to-day.\r\n\r\n"I did," said Boris shortly.\r\n\r\n"And you said yes, I hope?" She turned to me with a charming conventional\r\nsmile. I might have been an acquaintance of the day before yesterday. I\r\nmade her a low bow. "J\'avais bien l\'honneur, madame," but refusing to\r\ntake up our usual bantering tone, she murmured a hospitable commonplace\r\nand disappeared. Boris and I looked at one another.\r\n\r\n"I had better go home, don\'t you think?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Hanged if I know," he replied frankly.\r\n\r\nWhile we were discussing the advisability of my departure Genevieve\r\nreappeared in the doorway without her bonnet. She was wonderfully\r\nbeautiful, but her colour was too deep and her lovely eyes were too\r\nbright. She came straight up to me and took my arm.\r\n\r\n"Luncheon is ready. Was I cross, Alec? I thought I had a headache, but I\r\nhaven\'t. Come here, Boris;" and she slipped her other arm through his.\r\n"Alec knows that after you there is no one in the world whom I like as\r\nwell as I like him, so if he sometimes feels snubbed it won\'t hurt him."\r\n\r\n"A la bonheur!" I cried, "who says there are no thunderstorms in April?"\r\n\r\n"Are you ready?" chanted Boris. "Aye ready;" and arm-in-arm we raced into\r\nthe dining-room, scandalizing the servants. After all we were not so much\r\nto blame; Genevieve was eighteen, Boris was twenty-three, and I not quite\r\ntwenty-one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nSome work that I was doing about this time on the decorations for\r\nGenevieve\'s boudoir kept me constantly at the quaint little hotel in the\r\nRue Sainte-Cecile. Boris and I in those days laboured hard but as we\r\npleased, which was fitfully, and we all three, with Jack Scott, idled a\r\ngreat deal together.\r\n\r\nOne quiet afternoon I had been wandering alone over the house examining\r\ncurios, prying into odd corners, bringing out sweetmeats and cigars from\r\nstrange hiding-places, and at last I stopped in the bathing-room. Boris,\r\nall over clay, stood there washing his hands.\r\n\r\nThe room was built of rose-coloured marble excepting the floor, which was\r\ntessellated in rose and grey. In the centre was a square pool sunken\r\nbelow the surface of the floor; steps led down into it, sculptured\r\npillars supported a frescoed ceiling. A delicious marble Cupid appeared\r\nto have just alighted on his pedestal at the upper end of the room. The\r\nwhole interior was Boris\' work and mine. Boris, in his working-clothes of\r\nwhite canvas, scraped the traces of clay and red modelling wax from his\r\nhandsome hands, and coquetted over his shoulder with the Cupid.\r\n\r\n"I see you," he insisted, "don\'t try to look the other way and pretend\r\nnot to see me. You know who made you, little humbug!"\r\n\r\nIt was always my role to interpret Cupid\'s sentiments in these\r\nconversations, and when my turn came I responded in such a manner, that\r\nBoris seized my arm and dragged me toward the pool, declaring he would\r\nduck me. Next instant he dropped my arm and turned pale. "Good God!" he\r\nsaid, "I forgot the pool is full of the solution!"\r\n\r\nI shivered a little, and dryly advised him to remember better where he\r\nhad stored the precious liquid.\r\n\r\n"In Heaven\'s name, why do you keep a small lake of that gruesome stuff\r\nhere of all places?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"I want to experiment on something large," he replied.\r\n\r\n"On me, for instance?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! that came too close for jesting; but I do want to watch the action\r\nof that solution on a more highly organized living body; there is that\r\nbig white rabbit," he said, following me into the studio.\r\n\r\nJack Scott, wearing a paint-stained jacket, came wandering in,\r\nappropriated all the Oriental sweetmeats he could lay his hands on,\r\nlooted the cigarette case, and finally he and Boris disappeared together\r\nto visit the Luxembourg Gallery, where a new silver bronze by Rodin and a\r\nlandscape of Monet\'s were claiming the exclusive attention of artistic\r\nFrance. I went back to the studio, and resumed my work. It was a\r\nRenaissance screen, which Boris wanted me to paint for Genevieve\'s\r\nboudoir. But the small boy who was unwillingly dawdling through a series\r\nof poses for it, to-day refused all bribes to be good. He never rested an\r\ninstant in the same position, and inside of five minutes I had as many\r\ndifferent outlines of the little beggar.\r\n\r\n"Are you posing, or are you executing a song and dance, my friend?" I\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n"Whichever monsieur pleases," he replied, with an angelic smile.\r\n\r\nOf course I dismissed him for the day, and of course I paid him for the\r\nfull time, that being the way we spoil our models.\r\n\r\nAfter the young imp had gone, I made a few perfunctory daubs at my work,\r\nbut was so thoroughly out of humour, that it took me the rest of the\r\nafternoon to undo the damage I had done, so at last I scraped my palette,\r\nstuck my brushes in a bowl of black soap, and strolled into the\r\nsmoking-room. I really believe that, excepting Genevieve\'s apartments, no\r\nroom in the house was so free from the perfume of tobacco as this one. It\r\nwas a queer chaos of odds and ends, hung with threadbare tapestry. A\r\nsweet-toned old spinet in good repair stood by the window. There were\r\nstands of weapons, some old and dull, others bright and modern, festoons\r\nof Indian and Turkish armour over the mantel, two or three good pictures,\r\nand a pipe-rack. It was here that we used to come for new sensations in\r\nsmoking. I doubt if any type of pipe ever existed which was not\r\nrepresented in that rack. When we had selected one, we immediately\r\ncarried it somewhere else and smoked it; for the place was, on the whole,\r\nmore gloomy and less inviting than any in the house. But this afternoon,\r\nthe twilight was very soothing, the rugs and skins on the floor looked\r\nbrown and soft and drowsy; the big couch was piled with cushions--I found\r\nmy pipe and curled up there for an unaccustomed smoke in the\r\nsmoking-room. I had chosen one with a long flexible stem, and lighting it\r\nfell to dreaming. After a while it went out, but I did not stir. I\r\ndreamed on and presently fell asleep.\r\n\r\nI awoke to the saddest music I had ever heard. The room was quite dark, I\r\nhad no idea what time it was. A ray of moonlight silvered one edge of the\r\nold spinet, and the polished wood seemed to exhale the sounds as perfume\r\nfloats above a box of sandalwood. Some one rose in the darkness, and came\r\naway weeping quietly, and I was fool enough to cry out "Genevieve!"\r\n\r\nShe dropped at my voice, and, I had time to curse myself while I made a\r\nlight and tried to raise her from the floor. She shrank away with a\r\nmurmur of pain. She was very quiet, and asked for Boris. I carried her to\r\nthe divan, and went to look for him, but he was not in the house, and the\r\nservants were gone to bed. Perplexed and anxious, I hurried back to\r\nGenevieve. She lay where I had left her, looking very white.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t find Boris nor any of the servants," I said.\r\n\r\n"I know," she answered faintly, "Boris has gone to Ept with Mr. Scott. I\r\ndid not remember when I sent you for him just now."\r\n\r\n"But he can\'t get back in that case before to-morrow afternoon, and--are\r\nyou hurt? Did I frighten you into falling? What an awful fool I am, but I\r\nwas only half awake."\r\n\r\n"Boris thought you had gone home before dinner. Do please excuse us for\r\nletting you stay here all this time."\r\n\r\n"I have had a long nap," I laughed, "so sound that I did not know whether\r\nI was still asleep or not when I found myself staring at a figure that\r\nwas moving toward me, and called out your name. Have you been trying the\r\nold spinet? You must have played very softly."\r\n\r\nI would tell a thousand more lies worse than that one to see the look of\r\nrelief that came into her face. She smiled adorably, and said in her\r\nnatural voice: "Alec, I tripped on that wolf\'s head, and I think my ankle\r\nis sprained. Please call Marie, and then go home."\r\n\r\nI did as she bade me, and left her there when the maid came in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAt noon next day when I called, I found Boris walking restlessly about\r\nhis studio.\r\n\r\n"Genevieve is asleep just now," he told me, "the sprain is nothing, but\r\nwhy should she have such a high fever? The doctor can\'t account for it;\r\nor else he will not," he muttered.\r\n\r\n"Genevieve has a fever?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"I should say so, and has actually been a little light-headed at\r\nintervals all night. The idea! gay little Genevieve, without a care in\r\nthe world,--and she keeps saying her heart\'s broken, and she wants to\r\ndie!"\r\n\r\nMy own heart stood still.\r\n\r\nBoris leaned against the door of his studio, looking down, his hands in\r\nhis pockets, his kind, keen eyes clouded, a new line of trouble drawn\r\n"over the mouth\'s good mark, that made the smile." The maid had orders to\r\nsummon him the instant Genevieve opened her eyes. We waited and waited,\r\nand Boris, growing restless, wandered about, fussing with modelling wax\r\nand red clay. Suddenly he started for the next room. "Come and see my\r\nrose-coloured bath full of death!" he cried.\r\n\r\n"Is it death?" I asked, to humour his mood.\r\n\r\n"You are not prepared to call it life, I suppose," he answered. As he\r\nspoke he plucked a solitary goldfish squirming and twisting out of its\r\nglobe. "We\'ll send this one after the other--wherever that is," he said.\r\nThere was feverish excitement in his voice. A dull weight of fever lay on\r\nmy limbs and on my brain as I followed him to the fair crystal pool with\r\nits pink-tinted sides; and he dropped the creature in. Falling, its\r\nscales flashed with a hot orange gleam in its angry twistings and\r\ncontortions; the moment it struck the liquid it became rigid and sank\r\nheavily to the bottom. Then came the milky foam, the splendid hues\r\nradiating on the surface and then the shaft of pure serene light broke\r\nthrough from seemingly infinite depths. Boris plunged in his hand and\r\ndrew out an exquisite marble thing, blue-veined, rose-tinted, and\r\nglistening with opalescent drops.\r\n\r\n"Child\'s play," he muttered, and looked wearily, longingly at me,--as if\r\nI could answer such questions! But Jack Scott came in and entered into\r\nthe "game," as he called it, with ardour. Nothing would do but to try the\r\nexperiment on the white rabbit then and there. I was willing that Boris\r\nshould find distraction from his cares, but I hated to see the life go\r\nout of a warm, living creature and I declined to be present. Picking up a\r\nbook at random, I sat down in the studio to read. Alas! I had found\r\n_The King in Yellow_. After a few moments, which seemed ages, I was\r\nputting it away with a nervous shudder, when Boris and Jack came in\r\nbringing their marble rabbit. At the same time the bell rang above, and a\r\ncry came from the sick-room. Boris was gone like a flash, and the next\r\nmoment he called, "Jack, run for the doctor; bring him back with you.\r\nAlec, come here."\r\n\r\nI went and stood at her door. A frightened maid came out in haste and ran\r\naway to fetch some remedy. Genevieve, sitting bolt upright, with crimson\r\ncheeks and glittering eyes, babbled incessantly and resisted Boris\'\r\ngentle restraint. He called me to help. At my first touch she sighed and\r\nsank back, closing her eyes, and then--then--as we still bent above her,\r\nshe opened them again, looked straight into Boris\' face--poor\r\nfever-crazed girl!--and told her secret. At the same instant our three\r\nlives turned into new channels; the bond that held us so long together\r\nsnapped for ever and a new bond was forged in its place, for she had\r\nspoken my name, and as the fever tortured her, her heart poured out its\r\nload of hidden sorrow. Amazed and dumb I bowed my head, while my face\r\nburned like a live coal, and the blood surged in my ears, stupefying me\r\nwith its clamour. Incapable of movement, incapable of speech, I listened\r\nto her feverish words in an agony of shame and sorrow. I could not\r\nsilence her, I could not look at Boris. Then I felt an arm upon my\r\nshoulder, and Boris turned a bloodless face to mine.\r\n\r\n"It is not your fault, Alec; don\'t grieve so if she loves you--" but he\r\ncould not finish; and as the doctor stepped swiftly into the room,\r\nsaying--"Ah, the fever!" I seized Jack Scott and hurried him to the\r\nstreet, saying, "Boris would rather be alone." We crossed the street to\r\nour own apartments, and that night, seeing I was going to be ill too, he\r\nwent for the doctor again. The last thing I recollect with any\r\ndistinctness was hearing Jack say, "For Heaven\'s sake, doctor, what ails\r\nhim, to wear a face like that?" and I thought of _The King in\r\nYellow_ and the Pallid Mask.\r\n\r\nI was very ill, for the strain of two years which I had endured since\r\nthat fatal May morning when Genevieve murmured, "I love you, but I think\r\nI love Boris best," told on me at last. I had never imagined that it\r\ncould become more than I could endure. Outwardly tranquil, I had deceived\r\nmyself. Although the inward battle raged night after night, and I, lying\r\nalone in my room, cursed myself for rebellious thoughts unloyal to Boris\r\nand unworthy of Genevieve, the morning always brought relief, and I\r\nreturned to Genevieve and to my dear Boris with a heart washed clean by\r\nthe tempests of the night.\r\n\r\nNever in word or deed or thought while with them had I betrayed my sorrow\r\neven to myself.\r\n\r\nThe mask of self-deception was no longer a mask for me, it was a part of\r\nme. Night lifted it, laying bare the stifled truth below; but there was\r\nno one to see except myself, and when the day broke the mask fell back\r\nagain of its own accord. These thoughts passed through my troubled mind\r\nas I lay sick, but they were hopelessly entangled with visions of white\r\ncreatures, heavy as stone, crawling about in Boris\' basin,--of the wolf\'s\r\nhead on the rug, foaming and snapping at Genevieve, who lay smiling\r\nbeside it. I thought, too, of the King in Yellow wrapped in the fantastic\r\ncolours of his tattered mantle, and that bitter cry of Cassilda, "Not\r\nupon us, oh King, not upon us!" Feverishly I struggled to put it from me,\r\nbut I saw the lake of Hali, thin and blank, without a ripple or wind to\r\nstir it, and I saw the towers of Carcosa behind the moon. Aldebaran, the\r\nHyades, Alar, Hastur, glided through the cloud-rifts which fluttered and\r\nflapped as they passed like the scolloped tatters of the King in Yellow.\r\nAmong all these, one sane thought persisted. It never wavered, no matter\r\nwhat else was going on in my disordered mind, that my chief reason for\r\nexisting was to meet some requirement of Boris and Genevieve. What this\r\nobligation was, its nature, was never clear; sometimes it seemed to be\r\nprotection, sometimes support, through a great crisis. Whatever it seemed\r\nto be for the time, its weight rested only on me, and I was never so ill\r\nor so weak that I did not respond with my whole soul. There were always\r\ncrowds of faces about me, mostly strange, but a few I recognized, Boris\r\namong them. Afterward they told me that this could not have been, but I\r\nknow that once at least he bent over me. It was only a touch, a faint\r\necho of his voice, then the clouds settled back on my senses, and I lost\r\nhim, but he _did_ stand there and bend over me _once_ at least.\r\n\r\nAt last, one morning I awoke to find the sunlight falling across my bed,\r\nand Jack Scott reading beside me. I had not strength enough to speak\r\naloud, neither could I think, much less remember, but I could smile\r\nfeebly, as Jack\'s eye met mine, and when he jumped up and asked eagerly\r\nif I wanted anything, I could whisper, "Yes--Boris." Jack moved to the\r\nhead of my bed, and leaned down to arrange my pillow: I did not see his\r\nface, but he answered heartily, "You must wait, Alec; you are too weak to\r\nsee even Boris."\r\n\r\nI waited and I grew strong; in a few days I was able to see whom I would,\r\nbut meanwhile I had thought and remembered. From the moment when all the\r\npast grew clear again in my mind, I never doubted what I should do when\r\nthe time came, and I felt sure that Boris would have resolved upon the\r\nsame course so far as he was concerned; as for what pertained to me\r\nalone, I knew he would see that also as I did. I no longer asked for any\r\none. I never inquired why no message came from them; why during the week\r\nI lay there, waiting and growing stronger, I never heard their name\r\nspoken. Preoccupied with my own searchings for the right way, and with my\r\nfeeble but determined fight against despair, I simply acquiesced in\r\nJack\'s reticence, taking for granted that he was afraid to speak of them,\r\nlest I should turn unruly and insist on seeing them. Meanwhile I said\r\nover and over to myself, how would it be when life began again for us\r\nall? We would take up our relations exactly as they were before Genevieve\r\nfell ill. Boris and I would look into each other\'s eyes, and there would\r\nbe neither rancour nor cowardice nor mistrust in that glance. I would be\r\nwith them again for a little while in the dear intimacy of their home,\r\nand then, without pretext or explanation, I would disappear from their\r\nlives for ever. Boris would know; Genevieve--the only comfort was that\r\nshe would never know. It seemed, as I thought it over, that I had found\r\nthe meaning of that sense of obligation which had persisted all through\r\nmy delirium, and the only possible answer to it. So, when I was quite\r\nready, I beckoned Jack to me one day, and said--\r\n\r\n"Jack, I want Boris at once; and take my dearest greeting to\r\nGenevieve...."\r\n\r\nWhen at last he made me understand that they were both dead, I fell into\r\na wild rage that tore all my little convalescent strength to atoms. I\r\nraved and cursed myself into a relapse, from which I crawled forth some\r\nweeks afterward a boy of twenty-one who believed that his youth was gone\r\nfor ever. I seemed to be past the capability of further suffering, and\r\none day when Jack handed me a letter and the keys to Boris\' house, I took\r\nthem without a tremor and asked him to tell me all. It was cruel of me to\r\nask him, but there was no help for it, and he leaned wearily on his thin\r\nhands, to reopen the wound which could never entirely heal. He began very\r\nquietly--\r\n\r\n"Alec, unless you have a clue that I know nothing about, you will not be\r\nable to explain any more than I what has happened. I suspect that you\r\nwould rather not hear these details, but you must learn them, else I\r\nwould spare you the relation. God knows I wish I could be spared the\r\ntelling. I shall use few words.\r\n\r\n"That day when I left you in the doctor\'s care and came back to Boris, I\r\nfound him working on the \'Fates.\' Genevieve, he said, was sleeping under\r\nthe influence of drugs. She had been quite out of her mind, he said. He\r\nkept on working, not talking any more, and I watched him. Before long, I\r\nsaw that the third figure of the group--the one looking straight ahead,\r\nout over the world--bore his face; not as you ever saw it, but as it\r\nlooked then and to the end. This is one thing for which I should like to\r\nfind an explanation, but I never shall.\r\n\r\n"Well, he worked and I watched him in silence, and we went on that way\r\nuntil nearly midnight. Then we heard the door open and shut sharply, and\r\na swift rush in the next room. Boris sprang through the doorway and I\r\nfollowed; but we were too late. She lay at the bottom of the pool, her\r\nhands across her breast. Then Boris shot himself through the heart." Jack\r\nstopped speaking, drops of sweat stood under his eyes, and his thin\r\ncheeks twitched. "I carried Boris to his room. Then I went back and let\r\nthat hellish fluid out of the pool, and turning on all the water, washed\r\nthe marble clean of every drop. When at length I dared descend the steps,\r\nI found her lying there as white as snow. At last, when I had decided\r\nwhat was best to do, I went into the laboratory, and first emptied the\r\nsolution in the basin into the waste-pipe; then I poured the contents of\r\nevery jar and bottle after it. There was wood in the fire-place, so I\r\nbuilt a fire, and breaking the locks of Boris\' cabinet I burnt every\r\npaper, notebook and letter that I found there. With a mallet from the\r\nstudio I smashed to pieces all the empty bottles, then loading them into\r\na coal-scuttle, I carried them to the cellar and threw them over the\r\nred-hot bed of the furnace. Six times I made the journey, and at last,\r\nnot a vestige remained of anything which might again aid in seeking for\r\nthe formula which Boris had found. Then at last I dared call the doctor.\r\nHe is a good man, and together we struggled to keep it from the public.\r\nWithout him I never could have succeeded. At last we got the servants\r\npaid and sent away into the country, where old Rosier keeps them quiet\r\nwith stones of Boris\' and Genevieve\'s travels in distant lands, from\r\nwhence they will not return for years. We buried Boris in the little\r\ncemetery of Sevres. The doctor is a good creature, and knows when to pity\r\na man who can bear no more. He gave his certificate of heart disease and\r\nasked no questions of me."\r\n\r\nThen, lifting his head from his hands, he said, "Open the letter, Alec;\r\nit is for us both."\r\n\r\nI tore it open. It was Boris\' will dated a year before. He left\r\neverything to Genevieve, and in case of her dying childless, I was to\r\ntake control of the house in the Rue Sainte-Cecile, and Jack Scott the\r\nmanagement at Ept. On our deaths the property reverted to his mother\'s\r\nfamily in Russia, with the exception of the sculptured marbles executed\r\nby himself. These he left to me.\r\n\r\nThe page blurred under our eyes, and Jack got up and walked to the\r\nwindow. Presently he returned and sat down again. I dreaded to hear what\r\nhe was going to say, but he spoke with the same simplicity and\r\ngentleness.\r\n\r\n"Genevieve lies before the Madonna in the marble room. The Madonna bends\r\ntenderly above her, and Genevieve smiles back into that calm face that\r\nnever would have been except for her."\r\n\r\nHis voice broke, but he grasped my hand, saying, "Courage, Alec." Next\r\nmorning he left for Ept to fulfil his trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe same evening I took the keys and went into the house I had known so\r\nwell. Everything was in order, but the silence was terrible. Though I\r\nwent twice to the door of the marble room, I could not force myself to\r\nenter. It was beyond my strength. I went into the smoking-room and sat\r\ndown before the spinet. A small lace handkerchief lay on the keys, and I\r\nturned away, choking. It was plain I could not stay, so I locked every\r\ndoor, every window, and the three front and back gates, and went away.\r\nNext morning Alcide packed my valise, and leaving him in charge of my\r\napartments I took the Orient express for Constantinople. During the two\r\nyears that I wandered through the East, at first, in our letters, we\r\nnever mentioned Genevieve and Boris, but gradually their names crept in.\r\nI recollect particularly a passage in one of Jack\'s letters replying to\r\none of mine--\r\n\r\n"What you tell me of seeing Boris bending over you while you lay ill, and\r\nfeeling his touch on your face, and hearing his voice, of course troubles\r\nme. This that you describe must have happened a fortnight after he died.\r\nI say to myself that you were dreaming, that it was part of your\r\ndelirium, but the explanation does not satisfy me, nor would it you."\r\n\r\nToward the end of the second year a letter came from Jack to me in India\r\nso unlike anything that I had ever known of him that I decided to return\r\nat once to Paris. He wrote: "I am well, and sell all my pictures as\r\nartists do who have no need of money. I have not a care of my own, but I\r\nam more restless than if I had. I am unable to shake off a strange\r\nanxiety about you. It is not apprehension, it is rather a breathless\r\nexpectancy--of what, God knows! I can only say it is wearing me out.\r\nNights I dream always of you and Boris. I can never recall anything\r\nafterward, but I wake in the morning with my heart beating, and all day\r\nthe excitement increases until I fall asleep at night to recall the same\r\nexperience. I am quite exhausted by it, and have determined to break up\r\nthis morbid condition. I must see you. Shall I go to Bombay, or will you\r\ncome to Paris?"\r\n\r\nI telegraphed him to expect me by the next steamer.\r\n\r\nWhen we met I thought he had changed very little; I, he insisted, looked\r\nin splendid health. It was good to hear his voice again, and as we sat\r\nand chatted about what life still held for us, we felt that it was\r\npleasant to be alive in the bright spring weather.\r\n\r\nWe stayed in Paris together a week, and then I went for a week to Ept\r\nwith him, but first of all we went to the cemetery at Sevres, where Boris\r\nlay.\r\n\r\n"Shall we place the \'Fates\' in the little grove above him?" Jack asked,\r\nand I answered--\r\n\r\n"I think only the \'Madonna\' should watch over Boris\' grave." But Jack was\r\nnone the better for my home-coming. The dreams of which he could not\r\nretain even the least definite outline continued, and he said that at\r\ntimes the sense of breathless expectancy was suffocating.\r\n\r\n"You see I do you harm and not good," I said. "Try a change without me."\r\nSo he started alone for a ramble among the Channel Islands, and I went\r\nback to Paris. I had not yet entered Boris\' house, now mine, since my\r\nreturn, but I knew it must be done. It had been kept in order by Jack;\r\nthere were servants there, so I gave up my own apartment and went there\r\nto live. Instead of the agitation I had feared, I found myself able to\r\npaint there tranquilly. I visited all the rooms--all but one. I could not\r\nbring myself to enter the marble room where Genevieve lay, and yet I felt\r\nthe longing growing daily to look upon her face, to kneel beside her.\r\n\r\nOne April afternoon, I lay dreaming in the smoking-room, just as I had\r\nlain two years before, and mechanically I looked among the tawny Eastern\r\nrugs for the wolf-skin. At last I distinguished the pointed ears and flat\r\ncruel head, and I thought of my dream where I saw Genevieve lying beside\r\nit. The helmets still hung against the threadbare tapestry, among them\r\nthe old Spanish morion which I remembered Genevieve had once put on when\r\nwe were amusing ourselves with the ancient bits of mail. I turned my eyes\r\nto the spinet; every yellow key seemed eloquent of her caressing hand,\r\nand I rose, drawn by the strength of my life\'s passion to the sealed door\r\nof the marble room. The heavy doors swung inward under my trembling\r\nhands. Sunlight poured through the window, tipping with gold the wings of\r\nCupid, and lingered like a nimbus over the brows of the Madonna. Her\r\ntender face bent in compassion over a marble form so exquisitely pure\r\nthat I knelt and signed myself. Genevieve lay in the shadow under the\r\nMadonna, and yet, through her white arms, I saw the pale azure vein, and\r\nbeneath her softly clasped hands the folds of her dress were tinged with\r\nrose, as if from some faint warm light within her breast.\r\n\r\nBending, with a breaking heart, I touched the marble drapery with my\r\nlips, then crept back into the silent house.\r\n\r\nA maid came and brought me a letter, and I sat down in the little\r\nconservatory to read it; but as I was about to break the seal, seeing the\r\ngirl lingering, I asked her what she wanted.\r\n\r\nShe stammered something about a white rabbit that had been caught in the\r\nhouse, and asked what should be done with it I told her to let it loose\r\nin the walled garden behind the house, and opened my letter. It was from\r\nJack, but so incoherent that I thought he must have lost his reason. It\r\nwas nothing but a series of prayers to me not to leave the house until he\r\ncould get back; he could not tell me why, there were the dreams, he\r\nsaid--he could explain nothing, but he was sure that I must not leave the\r\nhouse in the Rue Sainte-Cecile.\r\n\r\nAs I finished reading I raised my eyes and saw the same maid-servant\r\nstanding in the doorway holding a glass dish in which two gold-fish were\r\nswimming: "Put them back into the tank and tell me what you mean by\r\ninterrupting me," I said.\r\n\r\nWith a half-suppressed whimper she emptied water and fish into an\r\naquarium at the end of the conservatory, and turning to me asked my\r\npermission to leave my service. She said people were playing tricks on\r\nher, evidently with a design of getting her into trouble; the marble\r\nrabbit had been stolen and a live one had been brought into the house;\r\nthe two beautiful marble fish were gone, and she had just found those\r\ncommon live things flopping on the dining-room floor. I reassured her and\r\nsent her away, saying I would look about myself. I went into the studio;\r\nthere was nothing there but my canvases and some casts, except the marble\r\nof the Easter lily. I saw it on a table across the room. Then I strode\r\nangrily over to it. But the flower I lifted from the table was fresh and\r\nfragile and filled the air with perfume.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly I comprehended, and sprang through the hall-way to the\r\nmarble room. The doors flew open, the sunlight streamed into my face, and\r\nthrough it, in a heavenly glory, the Madonna smiled, as Genevieve lifted\r\nher flushed face from her marble couch and opened her sleepy eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE COURT OF THE DRAGON\r\n\r\n\r\n  "Oh, thou who burn\'st in heart for those who burn\r\n  In Hell, whose fires thyself shall feed in turn;\r\n  How long be crying--\'Mercy on them.\' God!\r\n  Why, who art thou to teach and He to learn?"\r\n\r\nIn the Church of St. Barnabe vespers were over; the clergy left the\r\naltar; the little choir-boys flocked across the chancel and settled in\r\nthe stalls. A Suisse in rich uniform marched down the south aisle,\r\nsounding his staff at every fourth step on the stone pavement; behind him\r\ncame that eloquent preacher and good man, Monseigneur C----.\r\n\r\nMy chair was near the chancel rail, I now turned toward the west end of\r\nthe church. The other people between the altar and the pulpit turned too.\r\nThere was a little scraping and rustling while the congregation seated\r\nitself again; the preacher mounted the pulpit stairs, and the organ\r\nvoluntary ceased.\r\n\r\nI had always found the organ-playing at St. Barnabe highly interesting.\r\nLearned and scientific it was, too much so for my small knowledge, but\r\nexpressing a vivid if cold intelligence. Moreover, it possessed the\r\nFrench quality of taste: taste reigned supreme, self-controlled,\r\ndignified and reticent.\r\n\r\nTo-day, however, from the first chord I had felt a change for the worse,\r\na sinister change. During vespers it had been chiefly the chancel organ\r\nwhich supported the beautiful choir, but now and again, quite wantonly as\r\nit seemed, from the west gallery where the great organ stands, a heavy\r\nhand had struck across the church at the serene peace of those clear\r\nvoices. It was something more than harsh and dissonant, and it betrayed\r\nno lack of skill. As it recurred again and again, it set me thinking of\r\nwhat my architect\'s books say about the custom in early times to\r\nconsecrate the choir as soon as it was built, and that the nave, being\r\nfinished sometimes half a century later, often did not get any blessing\r\nat all: I wondered idly if that had been the case at St. Barnabe, and\r\nwhether something not usually supposed to be at home in a Christian\r\nchurch might have entered undetected and taken possession of the west\r\ngallery. I had read of such things happening, too, but not in works on\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\nThen I remembered that St. Barnabe was not much more than a hundred years\r\nold, and smiled at the incongruous association of mediaeval superstitions\r\nwith that cheerful little piece of eighteenth-century rococo.\r\n\r\nBut now vespers were over, and there should have followed a few quiet\r\nchords, fit to accompany meditation, while we waited for the sermon.\r\nInstead of that, the discord at the lower end of the church broke out\r\nwith the departure of the clergy, as if now nothing could control it.\r\n\r\nI belong to those children of an older and simpler generation who do not\r\nlove to seek for psychological subtleties in art; and I have ever refused\r\nto find in music anything more than melody and harmony, but I felt that\r\nin the labyrinth of sounds now issuing from that instrument there was\r\nsomething being hunted. Up and down the pedals chased him, while the\r\nmanuals blared approval. Poor devil! whoever he was, there seemed small\r\nhope of escape!\r\n\r\nMy nervous annoyance changed to anger. Who was doing this? How dare he\r\nplay like that in the midst of divine service? I glanced at the people\r\nnear me: not one appeared to be in the least disturbed. The placid brows\r\nof the kneeling nuns, still turned towards the altar, lost none of their\r\ndevout abstraction under the pale shadow of their white head-dress. The\r\nfashionable lady beside me was looking expectantly at Monseigneur C----.\r\nFor all her face betrayed, the organ might have been singing an Ave\r\nMaria.\r\n\r\nBut now, at last, the preacher had made the sign of the cross, and\r\ncommanded silence. I turned to him gladly. Thus far I had not found the\r\nrest I had counted on when I entered St. Barnabe that afternoon.\r\n\r\nI was worn out by three nights of physical suffering and mental trouble:\r\nthe last had been the worst, and it was an exhausted body, and a mind\r\nbenumbed and yet acutely sensitive, which I had brought to my favourite\r\nchurch for healing. For I had been reading _The King in Yellow_.\r\n\r\n"The sun ariseth; they gather themselves together and lay them down in\r\ntheir dens." Monseigneur C---- delivered his text in a calm voice,\r\nglancing quietly over the congregation. My eyes turned, I knew not why,\r\ntoward the lower end of the church. The organist was coming from behind\r\nhis pipes, and passing along the gallery on his way out, I saw him\r\ndisappear by a small door that leads to some stairs which descend\r\ndirectly to the street. He was a slender man, and his face was as white\r\nas his coat was black. "Good riddance!" I thought, "with your wicked\r\nmusic! I hope your assistant will play the closing voluntary."\r\n\r\nWith a feeling of relief--with a deep, calm feeling of relief, I turned\r\nback to the mild face in the pulpit and settled myself to listen. Here,\r\nat last, was the ease of mind I longed for.\r\n\r\n"My children," said the preacher, "one truth the human soul finds hardest\r\nof all to learn: that it has nothing to fear. It can never be made to see\r\nthat nothing can really harm it."\r\n\r\n"Curious doctrine!" I thought, "for a Catholic priest. Let us see how he\r\nwill reconcile that with the Fathers."\r\n\r\n"Nothing can really harm the soul," he went on, in, his coolest, clearest\r\ntones, "because----"\r\n\r\nBut I never heard the rest; my eye left his face, I knew not for what\r\nreason, and sought the lower end of the church. The same man was coming\r\nout from behind the organ, and was passing along the gallery _the same\r\nway_. But there had not been time for him to return, and if he had\r\nreturned, I must have seen him. I felt a faint chill, and my heart sank;\r\nand yet, his going and coming were no affair of mine. I looked at him: I\r\ncould not look away from his black figure and his white face. When he was\r\nexactly opposite to me, he turned and sent across the church straight\r\ninto my eyes, a look of hate, intense and deadly: I have never seen any\r\nother like it; would to God I might never see it again! Then he\r\ndisappeared by the same door through which I had watched him depart less\r\nthan sixty seconds before.\r\n\r\nI sat and tried to collect my thoughts. My first sensation was like that\r\nof a very young child badly hurt, when it catches its breath before\r\ncrying out.\r\n\r\nTo suddenly find myself the object of such hatred was exquisitely\r\npainful: and this man was an utter stranger. Why should he hate me\r\nso?--me, whom he had never seen before? For the moment all other\r\nsensation was merged in this one pang: even fear was subordinate to\r\ngrief, and for that moment I never doubted; but in the next I began to\r\nreason, and a sense of the incongruous came to my aid.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, St. Barnabe is a modern church. It is small and well\r\nlighted; one sees all over it almost at a glance. The organ gallery gets\r\na strong white light from a row of long windows in the clerestory, which\r\nhave not even coloured glass.\r\n\r\nThe pulpit being in the middle of the church, it followed that, when I\r\nwas turned toward it, whatever moved at the west end could not fail to\r\nattract my eye. When the organist passed it was no wonder that I saw him:\r\nI had simply miscalculated the interval between his first and his second\r\npassing. He had come in that last time by the other side-door. As for the\r\nlook which had so upset me, there had been no such thing, and I was a\r\nnervous fool.\r\n\r\nI looked about. This was a likely place to harbour supernatural horrors!\r\nThat clear-cut, reasonable face of Monseigneur C----, his collected\r\nmanner and easy, graceful gestures, were they not just a little\r\ndiscouraging to the notion of a gruesome mystery? I glanced above his\r\nhead, and almost laughed. That flyaway lady supporting one corner of the\r\npulpit canopy, which looked like a fringed damask table-cloth in a high\r\nwind, at the first attempt of a basilisk to pose up there in the organ\r\nloft, she would point her gold trumpet at him, and puff him out of\r\nexistence! I laughed to myself over this conceit, which, at the time, I\r\nthought very amusing, and sat and chaffed myself and everything else,\r\nfrom the old harpy outside the railing, who had made me pay ten centimes\r\nfor my chair, before she would let me in (she was more like a basilisk, I\r\ntold myself, than was my organist with the anaemic complexion): from that\r\ngrim old dame, to, yes, alas! Monseigneur C---- himself. For all\r\ndevoutness had fled. I had never yet done such a thing in my life, but\r\nnow I felt a desire to mock.\r\n\r\nAs for the sermon, I could not hear a word of it for the jingle in my\r\nears of\r\n\r\n "The skirts of St. Paul has reached.\r\n  Having preached us those six Lent lectures,\r\n  More unctuous than ever he preached,"\r\n\r\nkeeping time to the most fantastic and irreverent thoughts.\r\n\r\nIt was no use to sit there any longer: I must get out of doors and shake\r\nmyself free from this hateful mood. I knew the rudeness I was committing,\r\nbut still I rose and left the church.\r\n\r\nA spring sun was shining on the Rue St. Honore, as I ran down the church\r\nsteps. On one corner stood a barrow full of yellow jonquils, pale violets\r\nfrom the Riviera, dark Russian violets, and white Roman hyacinths in a\r\ngolden cloud of mimosa. The street was full of Sunday pleasure-seekers. I\r\nswung my cane and laughed with the rest. Some one overtook and passed me.\r\nHe never turned, but there was the same deadly malignity in his white\r\nprofile that there had been in his eyes. I watched him as long as I could\r\nsee him. His lithe back expressed the same menace; every step that\r\ncarried him away from me seemed to bear him on some errand connected with\r\nmy destruction.\r\n\r\nI was creeping along, my feet almost refusing to move. There began to\r\ndawn in me a sense of responsibility for something long forgotten. It\r\nbegan to seem as if I deserved that which he threatened: it reached a\r\nlong way back--a long, long way back. It had lain dormant all these\r\nyears: it was there, though, and presently it would rise and confront me.\r\nBut I would try to escape; and I stumbled as best I could into the Rue de\r\nRivoli, across the Place de la Concorde and on to the Quai. I looked with\r\nsick eyes upon the sun, shining through the white foam of the fountain,\r\npouring over the backs of the dusky bronze river-gods, on the far-away\r\nArc, a structure of amethyst mist, on the countless vistas of grey stems\r\nand bare branches faintly green. Then I saw him again coming down one of\r\nthe chestnut alleys of the Cours la Reine.\r\n\r\nI left the river-side, plunged blindly across to the Champs Elysees and\r\nturned toward the Arc. The setting sun was sending its rays along the\r\ngreen sward of the Rond-point: in the full glow he sat on a bench,\r\nchildren and young mothers all about him. He was nothing but a Sunday\r\nlounger, like the others, like myself. I said the words almost aloud, and\r\nall the while I gazed on the malignant hatred of his face. But he was not\r\nlooking at me. I crept past and dragged my leaden feet up the Avenue. I\r\nknew that every time I met him brought him nearer to the accomplishment\r\nof his purpose and my fate. And still I tried to save myself.\r\n\r\nThe last rays of sunset were pouring through the great Arc. I passed\r\nunder it, and met him face to face. I had left him far down the Champs\r\nElysees, and yet he came in with a stream of people who were returning\r\nfrom the Bois de Boulogne. He came so close that he brushed me. His\r\nslender frame felt like iron inside its loose black covering. He showed\r\nno signs of haste, nor of fatigue, nor of any human feeling. His whole\r\nbeing expressed one thing: the will, and the power to work me evil.\r\n\r\nIn anguish I watched him where he went down the broad crowded Avenue,\r\nthat was all flashing with wheels and the trappings of horses and the\r\nhelmets of the Garde Republicaine.\r\n\r\nHe was soon lost to sight; then I turned and fled. Into the Bois, and far\r\nout beyond it--I know not where I went, but after a long while as it\r\nseemed to me, night had fallen, and I found myself sitting at a table\r\nbefore a small cafe. I had wandered back into the Bois. It was hours now\r\nsince I had seen him. Physical fatigue and mental suffering had left me\r\nno power to think or feel. I was tired, so tired! I longed to hide away\r\nin my own den. I resolved to go home. But that was a long way off.\r\n\r\nI live in the Court of the Dragon, a narrow passage that leads from the\r\nRue de Rennes to the Rue du Dragon.\r\n\r\nIt is an "impasse"; traversable only for foot passengers. Over the\r\nentrance on the Rue de Rennes is a balcony, supported by an iron dragon.\r\nWithin the court tall old houses rise on either side, and close the ends\r\nthat give on the two streets. Huge gates, swung back during the day into\r\nthe walls of the deep archways, close this court, after midnight, and one\r\nmust enter then by ringing at certain small doors on the side. The sunken\r\npavement collects unsavoury pools. Steep stairways pitch down to doors\r\nthat open on the court. The ground floors are occupied by shops of\r\nsecond-hand dealers, and by iron workers. All day long the place rings\r\nwith the clink of hammers and the clang of metal bars.\r\n\r\nUnsavoury as it is below, there is cheerfulness, and comfort, and hard,\r\nhonest work above.\r\n\r\nFive flights up are the ateliers of architects and painters, and the\r\nhiding-places of middle-aged students like myself who want to live alone.\r\nWhen I first came here to live I was young, and not alone.\r\n\r\nI had to walk a while before any conveyance appeared, but at last, when I\r\nhad almost reached the Arc de Triomphe again, an empty cab came along and\r\nI took it.\r\n\r\nFrom the Arc to the Rue de Rennes is a drive of more than half an hour,\r\nespecially when one is conveyed by a tired cab horse that has been at the\r\nmercy of Sunday fete-makers.\r\n\r\nThere had been time before I passed under the Dragon\'s wings to meet my\r\nenemy over and over again, but I never saw him once, and now refuge was\r\nclose at hand.\r\n\r\nBefore the wide gateway a small mob of children were playing. Our\r\nconcierge and his wife walked among them, with their black poodle,\r\nkeeping order; some couples were waltzing on the side-walk. I returned\r\ntheir greetings and hurried in.\r\n\r\nAll the inhabitants of the court had trooped out into the street. The\r\nplace was quite deserted, lighted by a few lanterns hung high up, in\r\nwhich the gas burned dimly.\r\n\r\nMy apartment was at the top of a house, halfway down the court, reached\r\nby a staircase that descended almost into the street, with only a bit of\r\npassage-way intervening, I set my foot on the threshold of the open door,\r\nthe friendly old ruinous stairs rose before me, leading up to rest and\r\nshelter. Looking back over my right shoulder, I saw _him,_ ten paces\r\noff. He must have entered the court with me.\r\n\r\nHe was coming straight on, neither slowly, nor swiftly, but straight on\r\nto me. And now he was looking at me. For the first time since our eyes\r\nencountered across the church they met now again, and I knew that the\r\ntime had come.\r\n\r\nRetreating backward, down the court, I faced him. I meant to escape by\r\nthe entrance on the Rue du Dragon. His eyes told me that I never should\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nIt seemed ages while we were going, I retreating, he advancing, down the\r\ncourt in perfect silence; but at last I felt the shadow of the archway,\r\nand the next step brought me within it. I had meant to turn here and\r\nspring through into the street. But the shadow was not that of an\r\narchway; it was that of a vault. The great doors on the Rue du Dragon\r\nwere closed. I felt this by the blackness which surrounded me, and at the\r\nsame instant I read it in his face. How his face gleamed in the darkness,\r\ndrawing swiftly nearer! The deep vaults, the huge closed doors, their\r\ncold iron clamps were all on his side. The thing which he had threatened\r\nhad arrived: it gathered and bore down on me from the fathomless shadows;\r\nthe point from which it would strike was his infernal eyes. Hopeless, I\r\nset my back against the barred doors and defied him.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a scraping of chairs on the stone floor, and a rustling as the\r\ncongregation rose. I could hear the Suisse\'s staff in the south aisle,\r\npreceding Monseigneur C---- to the sacristy.\r\n\r\nThe kneeling nuns, roused from their devout abstraction, made their\r\nreverence and went away. The fashionable lady, my neighbour, rose also,\r\nwith graceful reserve. As she departed her glance just flitted over my\r\nface in disapproval.\r\n\r\nHalf dead, or so it seemed to me, yet intensely alive to every trifle, I\r\nsat among the leisurely moving crowd, then rose too and went toward the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nI had slept through the sermon. Had I slept through the sermon? I looked\r\nup and saw him passing along the gallery to his place. Only his side I\r\nsaw; the thin bent arm in its black covering looked like one of those\r\ndevilish, nameless instruments which lie in the disused torture-chambers\r\nof mediaeval castles.\r\n\r\nBut I had escaped him, though his eyes had said I should not. _Had_\r\nI escaped him? That which gave him the power over me came back out of\r\noblivion, where I had hoped to keep it. For I knew him now. Death and the\r\nawful abode of lost souls, whither my weakness long ago had sent\r\nhim--they had changed him for every other eye, but not for mine. I had\r\nrecognized him almost from the first; I had never doubted what he was\r\ncome to do; and now I knew while my body sat safe in the cheerful little\r\nchurch, he had been hunting my soul in the Court of the Dragon.\r\n\r\nI crept to the door: the organ broke out overhead with a blare. A\r\ndazzling light filled the church, blotting the altar from my eyes. The\r\npeople faded away, the arches, the vaulted roof vanished. I raised my\r\nseared eyes to the fathomless glare, and I saw the black stars hanging in\r\nthe heavens: and the wet winds from the lake of Hali chilled my face.\r\n\r\nAnd now, far away, over leagues of tossing cloud-waves, I saw the moon\r\ndripping with spray; and beyond, the towers of Carcosa rose behind the\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nDeath and the awful abode of lost souls, whither my weakness long ago had\r\nsent him, had changed him for every other eye but mine. And now I heard\r\n_his voice_, rising, swelling, thundering through the flaring light,\r\nand as I fell, the radiance increasing, increasing, poured over me in\r\nwaves of flame. Then I sank into the depths, and I heard the King in\r\nYellow whispering to my soul: "It is a fearful thing to fall into the\r\nhands of the living God!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YELLOW SIGN\r\n\r\n  "Let the red dawn surmise\r\n    What we shall do,\r\n  When this blue starlight dies\r\n    And all is through."\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThere are so many things which are impossible to explain! Why should\r\ncertain chords in music make me think of the brown and golden tints of\r\nautumn foliage? Why should the Mass of Sainte Cecile bend my thoughts\r\nwandering among caverns whose walls blaze with ragged masses of virgin\r\nsilver? What was it in the roar and turmoil of Broadway at six o\'clock\r\nthat flashed before my eyes the picture of a still Breton forest where\r\nsunlight filtered through spring foliage and Sylvia bent, half curiously,\r\nhalf tenderly, over a small green lizard, murmuring: "To think that this\r\nalso is a little ward of God!"\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw the watchman his back was toward me. I looked at him\r\nindifferently until he went into the church. I paid no more attention to\r\nhim than I had to any other man who lounged through Washington Square\r\nthat morning, and when I shut my window and turned back into my studio I\r\nhad forgotten him. Late in the afternoon, the day being warm, I raised\r\nthe window again and leaned out to get a sniff of air. A man was standing\r\nin the courtyard of the church, and I noticed him again with as little\r\ninterest as I had that morning. I looked across the square to where the\r\nfountain was playing and then, with my mind filled with vague impressions\r\nof trees, asphalt drives, and the moving groups of nursemaids and\r\nholiday-makers, I started to walk back to my easel. As I turned, my\r\nlistless glance included the man below in the churchyard. His face was\r\ntoward me now, and with a perfectly involuntary movement I bent to see\r\nit. At the same moment he raised his head and looked at me. Instantly I\r\nthought of a coffin-worm. Whatever it was about the man that repelled me\r\nI did not know, but the impression of a plump white grave-worm was so\r\nintense and nauseating that I must have shown it in my expression, for he\r\nturned his puffy face away with a movement which made me think of a\r\ndisturbed grub in a chestnut.\r\n\r\nI went back to my easel and motioned the model to resume her pose. After\r\nworking a while I was satisfied that I was spoiling what I had done as\r\nrapidly as possible, and I took up a palette knife and scraped the colour\r\nout again. The flesh tones were sallow and unhealthy, and I did not\r\nunderstand how I could have painted such sickly colour into a study which\r\nbefore that had glowed with healthy tones.\r\n\r\nI looked at Tessie. She had not changed, and the clear flush of health\r\ndyed her neck and cheeks as I frowned.\r\n\r\n"Is it something I\'ve done?" she said.\r\n\r\n"No,--I\'ve made a mess of this arm, and for the life of me I can\'t see\r\nhow I came to paint such mud as that into the canvas," I replied.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t I pose well?" she insisted.\r\n\r\n"Of course, perfectly."\r\n\r\n"Then it\'s not my fault?"\r\n\r\n"No. It\'s my own."\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry," she said.\r\n\r\nI told her she could rest while I applied rag and turpentine to the\r\nplague spot on my canvas, and she went off to smoke a cigarette and look\r\nover the illustrations in the _Courrier Francais_.\r\n\r\nI did not know whether it was something in the turpentine or a defect in\r\nthe canvas, but the more I scrubbed the more that gangrene seemed to\r\nspread. I worked like a beaver to get it out, and yet the disease\r\nappeared to creep from limb to limb of the study before me. Alarmed, I\r\nstrove to arrest it, but now the colour on the breast changed and the\r\nwhole figure seemed to absorb the infection as a sponge soaks up water.\r\nVigorously I plied palette-knife, turpentine, and scraper, thinking all\r\nthe time what a _seance_ I should hold with Duval who had sold me\r\nthe canvas; but soon I noticed that it was not the canvas which was\r\ndefective nor yet the colours of Edward. "It must be the turpentine," I\r\nthought angrily, "or else my eyes have become so blurred and confused by\r\nthe afternoon light that I can\'t see straight." I called Tessie, the\r\nmodel. She came and leaned over my chair blowing rings of smoke into the\r\nair.\r\n\r\n"What _have_ you been doing to it?" she exclaimed\r\n\r\n"Nothing," I growled, "it must be this turpentine!"\r\n\r\n"What a horrible colour it is now," she continued. "Do you think my flesh\r\nresembles green cheese?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t," I said angrily; "did you ever know me to paint like that\r\nbefore?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Well, then!"\r\n\r\n"It must be the turpentine, or something," she admitted.\r\n\r\nShe slipped on a Japanese robe and walked to the window. I scraped and\r\nrubbed until I was tired, and finally picked up my brushes and hurled\r\nthem through the canvas with a forcible expression, the tone alone of\r\nwhich reached Tessie\'s ears.\r\n\r\nNevertheless she promptly began: "That\'s it! Swear and act silly and ruin\r\nyour brushes! You have been three weeks on that study, and now look!\r\nWhat\'s the good of ripping the canvas? What creatures artists are!"\r\n\r\nI felt about as much ashamed as I usually did after such an outbreak, and\r\nI turned the ruined canvas to the wall. Tessie helped me clean my\r\nbrushes, and then danced away to dress. From the screen she regaled me\r\nwith bits of advice concerning whole or partial loss of temper, until,\r\nthinking, perhaps, I had been tormented sufficiently, she came out to\r\nimplore me to button her waist where she could not reach it on the\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n"Everything went wrong from the time you came back from the window and\r\ntalked about that horrid-looking man you saw in the churchyard," she\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\n"Yes, he probably bewitched the picture," I said, yawning. I looked at my\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\n"It\'s after six, I know," said Tessie, adjusting her hat before the\r\nmirror.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I replied, "I didn\'t mean to keep you so long." I leaned out of\r\nthe window but recoiled with disgust, for the young man with the pasty\r\nface stood below in the churchyard. Tessie saw my gesture of disapproval\r\nand leaned from the window.\r\n\r\n"Is that the man you don\'t like?" she whispered.\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t see his face, but he does look fat and soft. Someway or other,"\r\nshe continued, turning to look at me, "he reminds me of a dream,--an\r\nawful dream I once had. Or," she mused, looking down at her shapely\r\nshoes, "was it a dream after all?"\r\n\r\n"How should I know?" I smiled.\r\n\r\nTessie smiled in reply.\r\n\r\n"You were in it," she said, "so perhaps you might know something about\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Tessie! Tessie!" I protested, "don\'t you dare flatter by saying that you\r\ndream about me!"\r\n\r\n"But I did," she insisted; "shall I tell you about it?"\r\n\r\n"Go ahead," I replied, lighting a cigarette.\r\n\r\nTessie leaned back on the open window-sill and began very seriously.\r\n\r\n"One night last winter I was lying in bed thinking about nothing at all\r\nin particular. I had been posing for you and I was tired out, yet it\r\nseemed impossible for me to sleep. I heard the bells in the city ring\r\nten, eleven, and midnight. I must have fallen asleep about midnight\r\nbecause I don\'t remember hearing the bells after that. It seemed to me\r\nthat I had scarcely closed my eyes when I dreamed that something impelled\r\nme to go to the window. I rose, and raising the sash leaned out.\r\nTwenty-fifth Street was deserted as far as I could see. I began to be\r\nafraid; everything outside seemed so--so black and uncomfortable. Then\r\nthe sound of wheels in the distance came to my ears, and it seemed to me\r\nas though that was what I must wait for. Very slowly the wheels\r\napproached, and, finally, I could make out a vehicle moving along the\r\nstreet. It came nearer and nearer, and when it passed beneath my window I\r\nsaw it was a hearse. Then, as I trembled with fear, the driver turned and\r\nlooked straight at me. When I awoke I was standing by the open window\r\nshivering with cold, but the black-plumed hearse and the driver were\r\ngone. I dreamed this dream again in March last, and again awoke beside\r\nthe open window. Last night the dream came again. You remember how it was\r\nraining; when I awoke, standing at the open window, my night-dress was\r\nsoaked."\r\n\r\n"But where did I come into the dream?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"You--you were in the coffin; but you were not dead."\r\n\r\n"In the coffin?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"How did you know? Could you see me?"\r\n\r\n"No; I only knew you were there."\r\n\r\n"Had you been eating Welsh rarebits, or lobster salad?" I began,\r\nlaughing, but the girl interrupted me with a frightened cry.\r\n\r\n"Hello! What\'s up?" I said, as she shrank into the embrasure by the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n"The--the man below in the churchyard;--he drove the hearse."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense," I said, but Tessie\'s eyes were wide with terror. I went to\r\nthe window and looked out. The man was gone. "Come, Tessie," I urged,\r\n"don\'t be foolish. You have posed too long; you are nervous."\r\n\r\n"Do you think I could forget that face?" she murmured. "Three times I saw\r\nthe hearse pass below my window, and every time the driver turned and\r\nlooked up at me. Oh, his face was so white and--and soft? It looked\r\ndead--it looked as if it had been dead a long time."\r\n\r\nI induced the girl to sit down and swallow a glass of Marsala. Then I sat\r\ndown beside her, and tried to give her some advice.\r\n\r\n"Look here, Tessie," I said, "you go to the country for a week or two,\r\nand you\'ll have no more dreams about hearses. You pose all day, and when\r\nnight comes your nerves are upset. You can\'t keep this up. Then again,\r\ninstead of going to bed when your day\'s work is done, you run off to\r\npicnics at Sulzer\'s Park, or go to the Eldorado or Coney Island, and when\r\nyou come down here next morning you are fagged out. There was no real\r\nhearse. There was a soft-shell crab dream."\r\n\r\nShe smiled faintly.\r\n\r\n"What about the man in the churchyard?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, he\'s only an ordinary unhealthy, everyday creature."\r\n\r\n"As true as my name is Tessie Reardon, I swear to you, Mr. Scott, that\r\nthe face of the man below in the churchyard is the face of the man who\r\ndrove the hearse!"\r\n\r\n"What of it?" I said. "It\'s an honest trade."\r\n\r\n"Then you think I _did_ see the hearse?"\r\n\r\n"Oh," I said diplomatically, "if you really did, it might not be unlikely\r\nthat the man below drove it. There is nothing in that."\r\n\r\nTessie rose, unrolled her scented handkerchief, and taking a bit of gum\r\nfrom a knot in the hem, placed it in her mouth. Then drawing on her\r\ngloves she offered me her hand, with a frank, "Good-night, Mr. Scott,"\r\nand walked out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe next morning, Thomas, the bell-boy, brought me the _Herald_ and\r\na bit of news. The church next door had been sold. I thanked Heaven for\r\nit, not that being a Catholic I had any repugnance for the congregation\r\nnext door, but because my nerves were shattered by a blatant exhorter,\r\nwhose every word echoed through the aisle of the church as if it had been\r\nmy own rooms, and who insisted on his r\'s with a nasal persistence which\r\nrevolted my every instinct. Then, too, there was a fiend in human shape,\r\nan organist, who reeled off some of the grand old hymns with an\r\ninterpretation of his own, and I longed for the blood of a creature who\r\ncould play the doxology with an amendment of minor chords which one hears\r\nonly in a quartet of very young undergraduates. I believe the minister\r\nwas a good man, but when he bellowed: "And the Lorrrrd said unto Moses,\r\nthe Lorrrd is a man of war; the Lorrrd is his name. My wrath shall wax\r\nhot and I will kill you with the sworrrrd!" I wondered how many centuries\r\nof purgatory it would take to atone for such a sin.\r\n\r\n"Who bought the property?" I asked Thomas.\r\n\r\n"Nobody that I knows, sir. They do say the gent wot owns this \'ere\r\n\'Amilton flats was lookin\' at it. \'E might be a bildin\' more studios."\r\n\r\nI walked to the window. The young man with the unhealthy face stood by\r\nthe churchyard gate, and at the mere sight of him the same overwhelming\r\nrepugnance took possession of me.\r\n\r\n"By the way, Thomas," I said, "who is that fellow down there?"\r\n\r\nThomas sniffed. "That there worm, sir? \'Es night-watchman of the church,\r\nsir. \'E maikes me tired a-sittin\' out all night on them steps and lookin\'\r\nat you insultin\' like. I\'d a punched \'is \'ed, sir--beg pardon, sir--"\r\n\r\n"Go on, Thomas."\r\n\r\n"One night a comin\' \'ome with Arry, the other English boy, I sees \'im a\r\nsittin\' there on them steps. We \'ad Molly and Jen with us, sir, the two\r\ngirls on the tray service, an\' \'e looks so insultin\' at us that I up and\r\nsez: \'Wat you looking hat, you fat slug?\'--beg pardon, sir, but that\'s\r\n\'ow I sez, sir. Then \'e don\'t say nothin\' and I sez: \'Come out and I\'ll\r\npunch that puddin\' \'ed.\' Then I hopens the gate an\' goes in, but \'e don\'t\r\nsay nothin\', only looks insultin\' like. Then I \'its \'im one, but, ugh!\r\n\'is \'ed was that cold and mushy it ud sicken you to touch \'im."\r\n\r\n"What did he do then?" I asked curiously.\r\n\r\n"\'Im? Nawthin\'."\r\n\r\n"And you, Thomas?"\r\n\r\nThe young fellow flushed with embarrassment and smiled uneasily.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Scott, sir, I ain\'t no coward, an\' I can\'t make it out at all why I\r\nrun. I was in the 5th Lawncers, sir, bugler at Tel-el-Kebir, an\' was shot\r\nby the wells."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say you ran away?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; I run."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I want to know, sir. I grabbed Molly an\' run, an\' the\r\nrest was as frightened as I."\r\n\r\n"But what were they frightened at?"\r\n\r\nThomas refused to answer for a while, but now my curiosity was aroused\r\nabout the repulsive young man below and I pressed him. Three years\'\r\nsojourn in America had not only modified Thomas\' cockney dialect but had\r\ngiven him the American\'s fear of ridicule.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t believe me, Mr. Scott, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I will."\r\n\r\n"You will lawf at me, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated. "Well, sir, it\'s Gawd\'s truth that when I \'it \'im \'e\r\ngrabbed me wrists, sir, and when I twisted \'is soft, mushy fist one of\r\n\'is fingers come off in me \'and."\r\n\r\nThe utter loathing and horror of Thomas\' face must have been reflected in\r\nmy own, for he added:\r\n\r\n"It\'s orful, an\' now when I see \'im I just go away. \'E maikes me hill."\r\n\r\nWhen Thomas had gone I went to the window. The man stood beside the\r\nchurch-railing with both hands on the gate, but I hastily retreated to my\r\neasel again, sickened and horrified, for I saw that the middle finger of\r\nhis right hand was missing.\r\n\r\nAt nine o\'clock Tessie appeared and vanished behind the screen with a\r\nmerry "Good morning, Mr. Scott." When she had reappeared and taken her\r\npose upon the model-stand I started a new canvas, much to her delight.\r\nShe remained silent as long as I was on the drawing, but as soon as the\r\nscrape of the charcoal ceased and I took up my fixative she began to\r\nchatter.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I had such a lovely time last night. We went to Tony Pastor\'s."\r\n\r\n"Who are \'we\'?" I demanded.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Maggie, you know, Mr. Whyte\'s model, and Pinkie McCormick--we call\r\nher Pinkie because she\'s got that beautiful red hair you artists like so\r\nmuch--and Lizzie Burke."\r\n\r\nI sent a shower of spray from the fixative over the canvas, and said:\r\n"Well, go on."\r\n\r\n"We saw Kelly and Baby Barnes the skirt-dancer and--and all the rest. I\r\nmade a mash."\r\n\r\n"Then you have gone back on me, Tessie?"\r\n\r\nShe laughed and shook her head.\r\n\r\n"He\'s Lizzie Burke\'s brother, Ed. He\'s a perfect gen\'l\'man."\r\n\r\nI felt constrained to give her some parental advice concerning mashing,\r\nwhich she took with a bright smile.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I can take care of a strange mash," she said, examining her chewing\r\ngum, "but Ed is different. Lizzie is my best friend."\r\n\r\nThen she related how Ed had come back from the stocking mill in Lowell,\r\nMassachusetts, to find her and Lizzie grown up, and what an accomplished\r\nyoung man he was, and how he thought nothing of squandering half-a-dollar\r\nfor ice-cream and oysters to celebrate his entry as clerk into the\r\nwoollen department of Macy\'s. Before she finished I began to paint, and\r\nshe resumed the pose, smiling and chattering like a sparrow. By noon I\r\nhad the study fairly well rubbed in and Tessie came to look at it.\r\n\r\n"That\'s better," she said.\r\n\r\nI thought so too, and ate my lunch with a satisfied feeling that all was\r\ngoing well. Tessie spread her lunch on a drawing table opposite me and we\r\ndrank our claret from the same bottle and lighted our cigarettes from the\r\nsame match. I was very much attached to Tessie. I had watched her shoot\r\nup into a slender but exquisitely formed woman from a frail, awkward\r\nchild. She had posed for me during the last three years, and among all my\r\nmodels she was my favourite. It would have troubled me very much indeed\r\nhad she become "tough" or "fly," as the phrase goes, but I never noticed\r\nany deterioration of her manner, and felt at heart that she was all\r\nright. She and I never discussed morals at all, and I had no intention of\r\ndoing so, partly because I had none myself, and partly because I knew she\r\nwould do what she liked in spite of me. Still I did hope she would steer\r\nclear of complications, because I wished her well, and then also I had a\r\nselfish desire to retain the best model I had. I knew that mashing, as\r\nshe termed it, had no significance with girls like Tessie, and that such\r\nthings in America did not resemble in the least the same things in Paris.\r\nYet, having lived with my eyes open, I also knew that somebody would take\r\nTessie away some day, in one manner or another, and though I professed to\r\nmyself that marriage was nonsense, I sincerely hoped that, in this case,\r\nthere would be a priest at the end of the vista. I am a Catholic. When I\r\nlisten to high mass, when I sign myself, I feel that everything,\r\nincluding myself, is more cheerful, and when I confess, it does me good.\r\nA man who lives as much alone as I do, must confess to somebody. Then,\r\nagain, Sylvia was Catholic, and it was reason enough for me. But I was\r\nspeaking of Tessie, which is very different. Tessie also was Catholic and\r\nmuch more devout than I, so, taking it all in all, I had little fear for\r\nmy pretty model until she should fall in love. But _then_ I knew\r\nthat fate alone would decide her future for her, and I prayed inwardly\r\nthat fate would keep her away from men like me and throw into her path\r\nnothing but Ed Burkes and Jimmy McCormicks, bless her sweet face!\r\n\r\nTessie sat blowing rings of smoke up to the ceiling and tinkling the ice\r\nin her tumbler.\r\n\r\n"Do you know that I also had a dream last night?" I observed.\r\n\r\n"Not about that man," she laughed.\r\n\r\n"Exactly. A dream similar to yours, only much worse."\r\n\r\nIt was foolish and thoughtless of me to say this, but you know how little\r\ntact the average painter has. "I must have fallen asleep about ten\r\no\'clock," I continued, "and after a while I dreamt that I awoke. So\r\nplainly did I hear the midnight bells, the wind in the tree-branches, and\r\nthe whistle of steamers from the bay, that even now I can scarcely\r\nbelieve I was not awake. I seemed to be lying in a box which had a glass\r\ncover. Dimly I saw the street lamps as I passed, for I must tell you,\r\nTessie, the box in which I reclined appeared to lie in a cushioned wagon\r\nwhich jolted me over a stony pavement. After a while I became impatient\r\nand tried to move, but the box was too narrow. My hands were crossed on\r\nmy breast, so I could not raise them to help myself. I listened and then\r\ntried to call. My voice was gone. I could hear the trample of the horses\r\nattached to the wagon, and even the breathing of the driver. Then another\r\nsound broke upon my ears like the raising of a window sash. I managed to\r\nturn my head a little, and found I could look, not only through the glass\r\ncover of my box, but also through the glass panes in the side of the\r\ncovered vehicle. I saw houses, empty and silent, with neither light nor\r\nlife about any of them excepting one. In that house a window was open on\r\nthe first floor, and a figure all in white stood looking down into the\r\nstreet. It was you."\r\n\r\nTessie had turned her face away from me and leaned on the table with her\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\n"I could see your face," I resumed, "and it seemed to me to be very\r\nsorrowful. Then we passed on and turned into a narrow black lane.\r\nPresently the horses stopped. I waited and waited, closing my eyes with\r\near and impatience, but all was silent as the grave. After what seemed to\r\nme hours, I began to feel uncomfortable. A sense that somebody was close\r\nto me made me unclose my eyes. Then I saw the white face of the\r\nhearse-driver looking at me through the coffin-lid----"\r\n\r\nA sob from Tessie interrupted me. She was trembling like a leaf. I saw I\r\nhad made an ass of myself and attempted to repair the damage.\r\n\r\n"Why, Tess," I said, "I only told you this to show you what influence\r\nyour story might have on another person\'s dreams. You don\'t suppose I\r\nreally lay in a coffin, do you? What are you trembling for? Don\'t you see\r\nthat your dream and my unreasonable dislike for that inoffensive watchman\r\nof the church simply set my brain working as soon as I fell asleep?"\r\n\r\nShe laid her head between her arms, and sobbed as if her heart would\r\nbreak. What a precious triple donkey I had made of myself! But I was\r\nabout to break my record. I went over and put my arm about her.\r\n\r\n"Tessie dear, forgive me," I said; "I had no business to frighten you\r\nwith such nonsense. You are too sensible a girl, too good a Catholic to\r\nbelieve in dreams."\r\n\r\nHer hand tightened on mine and her head fell back upon my shoulder, but\r\nshe still trembled and I petted her and comforted her.\r\n\r\n"Come, Tess, open your eyes and smile."\r\n\r\nHer eyes opened with a slow languid movement and met mine, but their\r\nexpression was so queer that I hastened to reassure her again.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all humbug, Tessie; you surely are not afraid that any harm will\r\ncome to you because of that."\r\n\r\n"No," she said, but her scarlet lips quivered.\r\n\r\n"Then, what\'s the matter? Are you afraid?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Not for myself."\r\n\r\n"For me, then?" I demanded gaily.\r\n\r\n"For you," she murmured in a voice almost inaudible. "I--I care for you."\r\n\r\nAt first I started to laugh, but when I understood her, a shock passed\r\nthrough me, and I sat like one turned to stone. This was the crowning bit\r\nof idiocy I had committed. During the moment which elapsed between her\r\nreply and my answer I thought of a thousand responses to that innocent\r\nconfession. I could pass it by with a laugh, I could misunderstand her\r\nand assure her as to my health, I could simply point out that it was\r\nimpossible she could love me. But my reply was quicker than my thoughts,\r\nand I might think and think now when it was too late, for I had kissed\r\nher on the mouth.\r\n\r\nThat evening I took my usual walk in Washington Park, pondering over the\r\noccurrences of the day. I was thoroughly committed. There was no back out\r\nnow, and I stared the future straight in the face. I was not good, not\r\neven scrupulous, but I had no idea of deceiving either myself or Tessie.\r\nThe one passion of my life lay buried in the sunlit forests of Brittany.\r\nWas it buried for ever? Hope cried "No!" For three years I had been\r\nlistening to the voice of Hope, and for three years I had waited for a\r\nfootstep on my threshold. Had Sylvia forgotten? "No!" cried Hope.\r\n\r\nI said that I was no good. That is true, but still I was not exactly a\r\ncomic opera villain. I had led an easy-going reckless life, taking what\r\ninvited me of pleasure, deploring and sometimes bitterly regretting\r\nconsequences. In one thing alone, except my painting, was I serious, and\r\nthat was something which lay hidden if not lost in the Breton forests.\r\n\r\nIt was too late for me to regret what had occurred during the day.\r\nWhatever it had been, pity, a sudden tenderness for sorrow, or the more\r\nbrutal instinct of gratified vanity, it was all the same now, and unless\r\nI wished to bruise an innocent heart, my path lay marked before me. The\r\nfire and strength, the depth of passion of a love which I had never even\r\nsuspected, with all my imagined experience in the world, left me no\r\nalternative but to respond or send her away. Whether because I am so\r\ncowardly about giving pain to others, or whether it was that I have\r\nlittle of the gloomy Puritan in me, I do not know, but I shrank from\r\ndisclaiming responsibility for that thoughtless kiss, and in fact had no\r\ntime to do so before the gates of her heart opened and the flood poured\r\nforth. Others who habitually do their duty and find a sullen satisfaction\r\nin making themselves and everybody else unhappy, might have withstood it.\r\nI did not. I dared not. After the storm had abated I did tell her that\r\nshe might better have loved Ed Burke and worn a plain gold ring, but she\r\nwould not hear of it, and I thought perhaps as long as she had decided to\r\nlove somebody she could not marry, it had better be me. I, at least,\r\ncould treat her with an intelligent affection, and whenever she became\r\ntired of her infatuation she could go none the worse for it. For I was\r\ndecided on that point although I knew how hard it would be. I remembered\r\nthe usual termination of Platonic liaisons, and thought how disgusted I\r\nhad been whenever I heard of one. I knew I was undertaking a great deal\r\nfor so unscrupulous a man as I was, and I dreamed the future, but never\r\nfor one moment did I doubt that she was safe with me. Had it been anybody\r\nbut Tessie I should not have bothered my head about scruples. For it did\r\nnot occur to me to sacrifice Tessie as I would have sacrificed a woman of\r\nthe world. I looked the future squarely in the face and saw the several\r\nprobable endings to the affair. She would either tire of the whole thing,\r\nor become so unhappy that I should have either to marry her or go away.\r\nIf I married her we would be unhappy. I with a wife unsuited to me, and\r\nshe with a husband unsuitable for any woman. For my past life could\r\nscarcely entitle me to marry. If I went away she might either fall ill,\r\nrecover, and marry some Eddie Burke, or she might recklessly or\r\ndeliberately go and do something foolish. On the other hand, if she tired\r\nof me, then her whole life would be before her with beautiful vistas of\r\nEddie Burkes and marriage rings and twins and Harlem flats and Heaven\r\nknows what. As I strolled along through the trees by the Washington Arch,\r\nI decided that she should find a substantial friend in me, anyway, and\r\nthe future could take care of itself. Then I went into the house and put\r\non my evening dress, for the little faintly-perfumed note on my dresser\r\nsaid, "Have a cab at the stage door at eleven," and the note was signed\r\n"Edith Carmichel, Metropolitan Theatre."\r\n\r\nI took supper that night, or rather we took supper, Miss Carmichel and I,\r\nat Solari\'s, and the dawn was just beginning to gild the cross on the\r\nMemorial Church as I entered Washington Square after leaving Edith at the\r\nBrunswick. There was not a soul in the park as I passed along the trees\r\nand took the walk which leads from the Garibaldi statue to the Hamilton\r\nApartment House, but as I passed the churchyard I saw a figure sitting on\r\nthe stone steps. In spite of myself a chill crept over me at the sight of\r\nthe white puffy face, and I hastened to pass. Then he said something\r\nwhich might have been addressed to me or might merely have been a mutter\r\nto himself, but a sudden furious anger flamed up within me that such a\r\ncreature should address me. For an instant I felt like wheeling about and\r\nsmashing my stick over his head, but I walked on, and entering the\r\nHamilton went to my apartment. For some time I tossed about the bed\r\ntrying to get the sound of his voice out of my ears, but could not. It\r\nfilled my head, that muttering sound, like thick oily smoke from a\r\nfat-rendering vat or an odour of noisome decay. And as I lay and tossed\r\nabout, the voice in my ears seemed more distinct, and I began to\r\nunderstand the words he had muttered. They came to me slowly as if I had\r\nforgotten them, and at last I could make some sense out of the sounds. It\r\nwas this:\r\n\r\n"Have you found the Yellow Sign?"\r\n\r\n"Have you found the Yellow Sign?"\r\n\r\n"Have you found the Yellow Sign?"\r\n\r\nI was furious. What did he mean by that? Then with a curse upon him and\r\nhis I rolled over and went to sleep, but when I awoke later I looked pale\r\nand haggard, for I had dreamed the dream of the night before, and it\r\ntroubled me more than I cared to think.\r\n\r\nI dressed and went down into my studio. Tessie sat by the window, but as\r\nI came in she rose and put both arms around my neck for an innocent kiss.\r\nShe looked so sweet and dainty that I kissed her again and then sat down\r\nbefore the easel.\r\n\r\n"Hello! Where\'s the study I began yesterday?" I asked.\r\n\r\nTessie looked conscious, but did not answer. I began to hunt among the\r\npiles of canvases, saying, "Hurry up, Tess, and get ready; we must take\r\nadvantage of the morning light."\r\n\r\nWhen at last I gave up the search among the other canvases and turned to\r\nlook around the room for the missing study I noticed Tessie standing by\r\nthe screen with her clothes still on.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter," I asked, "don\'t you feel well?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Then hurry."\r\n\r\n"Do you want me to pose as--as I have always posed?"\r\n\r\nThen I understood. Here was a new complication. I had lost, of course,\r\nthe best nude model I had ever seen. I looked at Tessie. Her face was\r\nscarlet. Alas! Alas! We had eaten of the tree of knowledge, and Eden and\r\nnative innocence were dreams of the past--I mean for her.\r\n\r\nI suppose she noticed the disappointment on my face, for she said: "I\r\nwill pose if you wish. The study is behind the screen here where I put\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"No," I said, "we will begin something new;" and I went into my wardrobe\r\nand picked out a Moorish costume which fairly blazed with tinsel. It was\r\na genuine costume, and Tessie retired to the screen with it enchanted.\r\nWhen she came forth again I was astonished. Her long black hair was bound\r\nabove her forehead with a circlet of turquoises, and the ends, curled\r\nabout her glittering girdle. Her feet were encased in the embroidered\r\npointed slippers and the skirt of her costume, curiously wrought with\r\narabesques in silver, fell to her ankles. The deep metallic blue vest\r\nembroidered with silver and the short Mauresque jacket spangled and sewn\r\nwith turquoises became her wonderfully. She came up to me and held up her\r\nface smiling. I slipped my hand into my pocket, and drawing out a gold\r\nchain with a cross attached, dropped it over her head.\r\n\r\n"It\'s yours, Tessie."\r\n\r\n"Mine?" she faltered.\r\n\r\n"Yours. Now go and pose," Then with a radiant smile she ran behind the\r\nscreen and presently reappeared with a little box on which was written my\r\nname.\r\n\r\n"I had intended to give it to you when I went home to-night," she said,\r\n"but I can\'t wait now."\r\n\r\nI opened the box. On the pink cotton inside lay a clasp of black onyx, on\r\nwhich was inlaid a curious symbol or letter in gold. It was neither\r\nArabic nor Chinese, nor, as I found afterwards, did it belong to any\r\nhuman script.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all I had to give you for a keepsake," she said timidly.\r\n\r\nI was annoyed, but I told her how much I should prize it, and promised to\r\nwear it always. She fastened it on my coat beneath the lapel.\r\n\r\n"How foolish, Tess, to go and buy me such a beautiful thing as this," I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"I did not buy it," she laughed.\r\n\r\n"Where did you get it?"\r\n\r\nThen she told me how she had found it one day while coming from the\r\nAquarium in the Battery, how she had advertised it and watched the\r\npapers, but at last gave up all hopes of finding the owner.\r\n\r\n"That was last winter," she said, "the very day I had the first horrid\r\ndream about the hearse."\r\n\r\nI remembered my dream of the previous night but said nothing, and\r\npresently my charcoal was flying over a new canvas, and Tessie stood\r\nmotionless on the model-stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe day following was a disastrous one for me. While moving a framed\r\ncanvas from one easel to another my foot slipped on the polished floor,\r\nand I fell heavily on both wrists. They were so badly sprained that it\r\nwas useless to attempt to hold a brush, and I was obliged to wander about\r\nthe studio, glaring at unfinished drawings and sketches, until despair\r\nseized me and I sat down to smoke and twiddle my thumbs with rage. The\r\nrain blew against the windows and rattled on the roof of the church,\r\ndriving me into a nervous fit with its interminable patter. Tessie sat\r\nsewing by the window, and every now and then raised her head and looked\r\nat me with such innocent compassion that I began to feel ashamed of my\r\nirritation and looked about for something to occupy me. I had read all\r\nthe papers and all the books in the library, but for the sake of\r\nsomething to do I went to the bookcases and shoved them open with my\r\nelbow. I knew every volume by its colour and examined them all, passing\r\nslowly around the library and whistling to keep up my spirits. I was\r\nturning to go into the dining-room when my eye fell upon a book bound in\r\nserpent skin, standing in a corner of the top shelf of the last bookcase.\r\nI did not remember it, and from the floor could not decipher the pale\r\nlettering on the back, so I went to the smoking-room and called Tessie.\r\nShe came in from the studio and climbed up to reach the book.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"_The King in Yellow._"\r\n\r\nI was dumfounded. Who had placed it there? How came it in my rooms? I had\r\nlong ago decided that I should never open that book, and nothing on earth\r\ncould have persuaded me to buy it. Fearful lest curiosity might tempt me\r\nto open it, I had never even looked at it in book-stores. If I ever had\r\nhad any curiosity to read it, the awful tragedy of young Castaigne, whom\r\nI knew, prevented me from exploring its wicked pages. I had always\r\nrefused to listen to any description of it, and indeed, nobody ever\r\nventured to discuss the second part aloud, so I had absolutely no\r\nknowledge of what those leaves might reveal. I stared at the poisonous\r\nmottled binding as I would at a snake.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t touch it, Tessie," I said; "come down."\r\n\r\nOf course my admonition was enough to arouse her curiosity, and before I\r\ncould prevent it she took the book and, laughing, danced off into the\r\nstudio with it. I called to her, but she slipped away with a tormenting\r\nsmile at my helpless hands, and I followed her with some impatience.\r\n\r\n"Tessie!" I cried, entering the library, "listen, I am serious. Put that\r\nbook away. I do not wish you to open it!" The library was empty. I went\r\ninto both drawing-rooms, then into the bedrooms, laundry, kitchen, and\r\nfinally returned to the library and began a systematic search. She had\r\nhidden herself so well that it was half-an-hour later when I discovered\r\nher crouching white and silent by the latticed window in the store-room\r\nabove. At the first glance I saw she had been punished for her\r\nfoolishness. _The King in Yellow_ lay at her feet, but the book was\r\nopen at the second part. I looked at Tessie and saw it was too late. She\r\nhad opened _The King in Yellow_. Then I took her by the hand and led\r\nher into the studio. She seemed dazed, and when I told her to lie down on\r\nthe sofa she obeyed me without a word. After a while she closed her eyes\r\nand her breathing became regular and deep, but I could not determine\r\nwhether or not she slept. For a long while I sat silently beside her, but\r\nshe neither stirred nor spoke, and at last I rose, and, entering the\r\nunused store-room, took the book in my least injured hand. It seemed\r\nheavy as lead, but I carried it into the studio again, and sitting down\r\non the rug beside the sofa, opened it and read it through from beginning\r\nto end.\r\n\r\nWhen, faint with excess of my emotions, I dropped the volume and leaned\r\nwearily back against the sofa, Tessie opened her eyes and looked at\r\nme....\r\n\r\nWe had been speaking for some time in a dull monotonous strain before I\r\nrealized that we were discussing _The King in Yellow_. Oh the sin of\r\nwriting such words,--words which are clear as crystal, limpid and musical\r\nas bubbling springs, words which sparkle and glow like the poisoned\r\ndiamonds of the Medicis! Oh the wickedness, the hopeless damnation of a\r\nsoul who could fascinate and paralyze human creatures with such\r\nwords,--words understood by the ignorant and wise alike, words which are\r\nmore precious than jewels, more soothing than music, more awful than\r\ndeath!\r\n\r\nWe talked on, unmindful of the gathering shadows, and she was begging me\r\nto throw away the clasp of black onyx quaintly inlaid with what we now\r\nknew to be the Yellow Sign. I never shall know why I refused, though even\r\nat this hour, here in my bedroom as I write this confession, I should be\r\nglad to know _what_ it was that prevented me from tearing the Yellow\r\nSign from my breast and casting it into the fire. I am sure I wished to\r\ndo so, and yet Tessie pleaded with me in vain. Night fell and the hours\r\ndragged on, but still we murmured to each other of the King and the\r\nPallid Mask, and midnight sounded from the misty spires in the\r\nfog-wrapped city. We spoke of Hastur and of Cassilda, while outside the\r\nfog rolled against the blank window-panes as the cloud waves roll and\r\nbreak on the shores of Hali.\r\n\r\nThe house was very silent now, and not a sound came up from the misty\r\nstreets. Tessie lay among the cushions, her face a grey blot in the\r\ngloom, but her hands were clasped in mine, and I knew that she knew and\r\nread my thoughts as I read hers, for we had understood the mystery of the\r\nHyades and the Phantom of Truth was laid. Then as we answered each other,\r\nswiftly, silently, thought on thought, the shadows stirred in the gloom\r\nabout us, and far in the distant streets we heard a sound. Nearer and\r\nnearer it came, the dull crunching of wheels, nearer and yet nearer, and\r\nnow, outside before the door it ceased, and I dragged myself to the\r\nwindow and saw a black-plumed hearse. The gate below opened and shut, and\r\nI crept shaking to my door and bolted it, but I knew no bolts, no locks,\r\ncould keep that creature out who was coming for the Yellow Sign. And now\r\nI heard him moving very softly along the hall. Now he was at the door,\r\nand the bolts rotted at his touch. Now he had entered. With eyes starting\r\nfrom my head I peered into the darkness, but when he came into the room I\r\ndid not see him. It was only when I felt him envelope me in his cold soft\r\ngrasp that I cried out and struggled with deadly fury, but my hands were\r\nuseless and he tore the onyx clasp from my coat and struck me full in the\r\nface. Then, as I fell, I heard Tessie\'s soft cry and her spirit fled: and\r\neven while falling I longed to follow her, for I knew that the King in\r\nYellow had opened his tattered mantle and there was only God to cry to\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nI could tell more, but I cannot see what help it will be to the world. As\r\nfor me, I am past human help or hope. As I lie here, writing, careless\r\neven whether or not I die before I finish, I can see the doctor gathering\r\nup his powders and phials with a vague gesture to the good priest beside\r\nme, which I understand.\r\n\r\nThey will be very curious to know the tragedy--they of the outside world\r\nwho write books and print millions of newspapers, but I shall write no\r\nmore, and the father confessor will seal my last words with the seal of\r\nsanctity when his holy office is done. They of the outside world may send\r\ntheir creatures into wrecked homes and death-smitten firesides, and their\r\nnewspapers will batten on blood and tears, but with me their spies must\r\nhalt before the confessional. They know that Tessie is dead and that I am\r\ndying. They know how the people in the house, aroused by an infernal\r\nscream, rushed into my room and found one living and two dead, but they\r\ndo not know what I shall tell them now; they do not know that the doctor\r\nsaid as he pointed to a horrible decomposed heap on the floor--the livid\r\ncorpse of the watchman from the church: "I have no theory, no explanation.\r\nThat man must have been dead for months!"\r\n\r\n\r\nI think I am dying. I wish the priest would--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEMOISELLE D\'YS\r\n\r\n  "Mais je croy que je\r\n  Suis descendu on puiz\r\n  Tenebreux onquel disoit\r\n  Heraclytus estre Verete cachee."\r\n\r\n"There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I\r\nknow not:\r\n\r\n"The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the\r\nway of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid."\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe utter desolation of the scene began to have its effect; I sat down to\r\nface the situation and, if possible, recall to mind some landmark which\r\nmight aid me in extricating myself from my present position. If I could\r\nonly find the ocean again all would be clear, for I knew one could see\r\nthe island of Groix from the cliffs.\r\n\r\nI laid down my gun, and kneeling behind a rock lighted a pipe. Then I\r\nlooked at my watch. It was nearly four o\'clock. I might have wandered far\r\nfrom Kerselec since daybreak.\r\n\r\nStanding the day before on the cliffs below Kerselec with Goulven,\r\nlooking out over the sombre moors among which I had now lost my way,\r\nthese downs had appeared to me level as a meadow, stretching to the\r\nhorizon, and although I knew how deceptive is distance, I could not\r\nrealize that what from Kerselec seemed to be mere grassy hollows were\r\ngreat valleys covered with gorse and heather, and what looked like\r\nscattered boulders were in reality enormous cliffs of granite.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a bad place for a stranger," old Goulven had said: "you\'d better\r\ntake a guide;" and I had replied, "I shall not lose myself." Now I knew\r\nthat I had lost myself, as I sat there smoking, with the sea-wind blowing\r\nin my face. On every side stretched the moorland, covered with flowering\r\ngorse and heath and granite boulders. There was not a tree in sight, much\r\nless a house. After a while, I picked up the gun, and turning my back on\r\nthe sun tramped on again.\r\n\r\nThere was little use in following any of the brawling streams which every\r\nnow and then crossed my path, for, instead of flowing into the sea, they\r\nran inland to reedy pools in the hollows of the moors. I had followed\r\nseveral, but they all led me to swamps or silent little ponds from which\r\nthe snipe rose peeping and wheeled away in an ecstasy of fright I began\r\nto feel fatigued, and the gun galled my shoulder in spite of the double\r\npads. The sun sank lower and lower, shining level across yellow gorse and\r\nthe moorland pools.\r\n\r\nAs I walked my own gigantic shadow led me on, seeming to lengthen at\r\nevery step. The gorse scraped against my leggings, crackled beneath my\r\nfeet, showering the brown earth with blossoms, and the brake bowed and\r\nbillowed along my path. From tufts of heath rabbits scurried away through\r\nthe bracken, and among the swamp grass I heard the wild duck\'s drowsy\r\nquack. Once a fox stole across my path, and again, as I stooped to drink\r\nat a hurrying rill, a heron flapped heavily from the reeds beside me. I\r\nturned to look at the sun. It seemed to touch the edges of the plain.\r\nWhen at last I decided that it was useless to go on, and that I must make\r\nup my mind to spend at least one night on the moors, I threw myself down\r\nthoroughly fagged out. The evening sunlight slanted warm across my body,\r\nbut the sea-winds began to rise, and I felt a chill strike through me\r\nfrom my wet shooting-boots. High overhead gulls were wheeling and tossing\r\nlike bits of white paper; from some distant marsh a solitary curlew\r\ncalled. Little by little the sun sank into the plain, and the zenith\r\nflushed with the after-glow. I watched the sky change from palest gold to\r\npink and then to smouldering fire. Clouds of midges danced above me, and\r\nhigh in the calm air a bat dipped and soared. My eyelids began to droop.\r\nThen as I shook off the drowsiness a sudden crash among the bracken\r\nroused me. I raised my eyes. A great bird hung quivering in the air above\r\nmy face. For an instant I stared, incapable of motion; then something\r\nleaped past me in the ferns and the bird rose, wheeled, and pitched\r\nheadlong into the brake.\r\n\r\nI was on my feet in an instant peering through the gorse. There came the\r\nsound of a struggle from a bunch of heather close by, and then all was\r\nquiet. I stepped forward, my gun poised, but when I came to the heather\r\nthe gun fell under my arm again, and I stood motionless in silent\r\nastonishment A dead hare lay on the ground, and on the hare stood a\r\nmagnificent falcon, one talon buried in the creature\'s neck, the other\r\nplanted firmly on its limp flank. But what astonished me, was not the\r\nmere sight of a falcon sitting upon its prey. I had seen that more than\r\nonce. It was that the falcon was fitted with a sort of leash about both\r\ntalons, and from the leash hung a round bit of metal like a sleigh-bell.\r\nThe bird turned its fierce yellow eyes on me, and then stooped and struck\r\nits curved beak into the quarry. At the same instant hurried steps\r\nsounded among the heather, and a girl sprang into the covert in front.\r\nWithout a glance at me she walked up to the falcon, and passing her\r\ngloved hand under its breast, raised it from the quarry. Then she deftly\r\nslipped a small hood over the bird\'s head, and holding it out on her\r\ngauntlet, stooped and picked up the hare.\r\n\r\nShe passed a cord about the animal\'s legs and fastened the end of the\r\nthong to her girdle. Then she started to retrace her steps through the\r\ncovert As she passed me I raised my cap and she acknowledged my presence\r\nwith a scarcely perceptible inclination. I had been so astonished, so\r\nlost in admiration of the scene before my eyes, that it had not occurred\r\nto me that here was my salvation. But as she moved away I recollected\r\nthat unless I wanted to sleep on a windy moor that night I had better\r\nrecover my speech without delay. At my first word she hesitated, and as I\r\nstepped before her I thought a look of fear came into her beautiful eyes.\r\nBut as I humbly explained my unpleasant plight, her face flushed and she\r\nlooked at me in wonder.\r\n\r\n"Surely you did not come from Kerselec!" she repeated.\r\n\r\nHer sweet voice had no trace of the Breton accent nor of any accent which\r\nI knew, and yet there was something in it I seemed to have heard before,\r\nsomething quaint and indefinable, like the theme of an old song.\r\n\r\nI explained that I was an American, unacquainted with Finistere, shooting\r\nthere for my own amusement.\r\n\r\n"An American," she repeated in the same quaint musical tones. "I have\r\nnever before seen an American."\r\n\r\nFor a moment she stood silent, then looking at me she said. "If you\r\nshould walk all night you could not reach Kerselec now, even if you had a\r\nguide."\r\n\r\nThis was pleasant news.\r\n\r\n"But," I began, "if I could only find a peasant\'s hut where I might get\r\nsomething to eat, and shelter."\r\n\r\nThe falcon on her wrist fluttered and shook its head. The girl smoothed\r\nits glossy back and glanced at me.\r\n\r\n"Look around," she said gently. "Can you see the end of these moors?\r\nLook, north, south, east, west. Can you see anything but moorland and\r\nbracken?"\r\n\r\n"No," I said.\r\n\r\n"The moor is wild and desolate. It is easy to enter, but sometimes they\r\nwho enter never leave it. There are no peasants\' huts here."\r\n\r\n"Well," I said, "if you will tell me in which direction Kerselec lies,\r\nto-morrow it will take me no longer to go back than it has to come."\r\n\r\nShe looked at me again with an expression almost like pity.\r\n\r\n"Ah," she said, "to come is easy and takes hours; to go is different--and\r\nmay take centuries."\r\n\r\nI stared at her in amazement but decided that I had misunderstood her.\r\nThen before I had time to speak she drew a whistle from her belt and\r\nsounded it.\r\n\r\n"Sit down and rest," she said to me; "you have come a long distance and\r\nare tired."\r\n\r\nShe gathered up her pleated skirts and motioning me to follow picked her\r\ndainty way through the gorse to a flat rock among the ferns.\r\n\r\n"They will be here directly," she said, and taking a seat at one end of\r\nthe rock invited me to sit down on the other edge. The after-glow was\r\nbeginning to fade in the sky and a single star twinkled faintly through\r\nthe rosy haze. A long wavering triangle of water-fowl drifted southward\r\nover our heads, and from the swamps around plover were calling.\r\n\r\n"They are very beautiful--these moors," she said quietly.\r\n\r\n"Beautiful, but cruel to strangers," I answered.\r\n\r\n"Beautiful and cruel," she repeated dreamily, "beautiful and cruel."\r\n\r\n"Like a woman," I said stupidly.\r\n\r\n"Oh," she cried with a little catch in her breath, and looked at me. Her\r\ndark eyes met mine, and I thought she seemed angry or frightened.\r\n\r\n"Like a woman," she repeated under her breath, "How cruel to say so!"\r\nThen after a pause, as though speaking aloud to herself, "How cruel for\r\nhim to say that!"\r\n\r\nI don\'t know what sort of an apology I offered for my inane, though\r\nharmless speech, but I know that she seemed so troubled about it that I\r\nbegan to think I had said something very dreadful without knowing it, and\r\nremembered with horror the pitfalls and snares which the French language\r\nsets for foreigners. While I was trying to imagine what I might have\r\nsaid, a sound of voices came across the moor, and the girl rose to her\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n"No," she said, with a trace of a smile on her pale face, "I will not\r\naccept your apologies, monsieur, but I must prove you wrong, and that\r\nshall be my revenge. Look. Here come Hastur and Raoul."\r\n\r\nTwo men loomed up in the twilight. One had a sack across his shoulders\r\nand the other carried a hoop before him as a waiter carries a tray. The\r\nhoop was fastened with straps to his shoulders, and around the edge of\r\nthe circlet sat three hooded falcons fitted with tinkling bells. The girl\r\nstepped up to the falconer, and with a quick turn of her wrist\r\ntransferred her falcon to the hoop, where it quickly sidled off and\r\nnestled among its mates, who shook their hooded heads and ruffled their\r\nfeathers till the belled jesses tinkled again. The other man stepped\r\nforward and bowing respectfully took up the hare and dropped it into the\r\ngame-sack.\r\n\r\n"These are my piqueurs," said the girl, turning to me with a gentle\r\ndignity. "Raoul is a good fauconnier, and I shall some day make him grand\r\nveneur. Hastur is incomparable."\r\n\r\nThe two silent men saluted me respectfully.\r\n\r\n"Did I not tell you, monsieur, that I should prove you wrong?" she\r\ncontinued. "This, then, is my revenge, that you do me the courtesy of\r\naccepting food and shelter at my own house."\r\n\r\nBefore I could answer she spoke to the falconers, who started instantly\r\nacross the heath, and with a gracious gesture to me she followed. I don\'t\r\nknow whether I made her understand how profoundly grateful I felt, but\r\nshe seemed pleased to listen, as we walked over the dewy heather.\r\n\r\n"Are you not very tired?" she asked.\r\n\r\nI had clean forgotten my fatigue in her presence, and I told her so.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think your gallantry is a little old-fashioned?" she said; and\r\nwhen I looked confused and humbled, she added quietly, "Oh, I like it, I\r\nlike everything old-fashioned, and it is delightful to hear you say such\r\npretty things."\r\n\r\nThe moorland around us was very still now under its ghostly sheet of\r\nmist. The plovers had ceased their calling; the crickets and all the\r\nlittle creatures of the fields were silent as we passed, yet it seemed to\r\nme as if I could hear them beginning again far behind us. Well in\r\nadvance, the two tall falconers strode across the heather, and the faint\r\njingling of the hawks\' bells came to our ears in distant murmuring\r\nchimes.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a splendid hound dashed out of the mist in front, followed by\r\nanother and another until half-a-dozen or more were bounding and leaping\r\naround the girl beside me. She caressed and quieted them with her gloved\r\nhand, speaking to them in quaint terms which I remembered to have seen in\r\nold French manuscripts.\r\n\r\nThen the falcons on the circlet borne by the falconer ahead began to beat\r\ntheir wings and scream, and from somewhere out of sight the notes of a\r\nhunting-horn floated across the moor. The hounds sprang away before us\r\nand vanished in the twilight, the falcons flapped and squealed upon their\r\nperch, and the girl, taking up the song of the horn, began to hum. Clear\r\nand mellow her voice sounded in the night air.\r\n\r\n  "Chasseur, chasseur, chassez encore,\r\n  Quittez Rosette et Jeanneton,\r\n  Tonton, tonton, tontaine, tonton,\r\n  Ou, pour, rabattre, des l\'aurore,\r\n  Que les Amours soient de planton,\r\n  Tonton, tontaine, tonton."\r\n\r\nAs I listened to her lovely voice a grey mass which rapidly grew more\r\ndistinct loomed up in front, and the horn rang out joyously through the\r\ntumult of the hounds and falcons. A torch glimmered at a gate, a light\r\nstreamed through an opening door, and we stepped upon a wooden bridge\r\nwhich trembled under our feet and rose creaking and straining behind us\r\nas we passed over the moat and into a small stone court, walled on every\r\nside. From an open doorway a man came and, bending in salutation,\r\npresented a cup to the girl beside me. She took the cup and touched it\r\nwith her lips, then lowering it turned to me and said in a low voice, "I\r\nbid you welcome."\r\n\r\nAt that moment one of the falconers came with another cup, but before\r\nhanding it to me, presented it to the girl, who tasted it. The falconer\r\nmade a gesture to receive it, but she hesitated a moment, and then,\r\nstepping forward, offered me the cup with her own hands. I felt this to\r\nbe an act of extraordinary graciousness, but hardly knew what was\r\nexpected of me, and did not raise it to my lips at once. The girl flushed\r\ncrimson. I saw that I must act quickly.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle," I faltered, "a stranger whom you have saved from dangers\r\nhe may never realize empties this cup to the gentlest and loveliest\r\nhostess of France."\r\n\r\n"In His name," she murmured, crossing herself as I drained the cup. Then\r\nstepping into the doorway she turned to me with a pretty gesture and,\r\ntaking my hand in hers, led me into the house, saying again and again:\r\n"You are very welcome, indeed you are welcome to the Chateau d\'Ys."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nI awoke next morning with the music of the horn in my ears, and leaping\r\nout of the ancient bed, went to a curtained window where the sunlight\r\nfiltered through little deep-set panes. The horn ceased as I looked into\r\nthe court below.\r\n\r\nA man who might have been brother to the two falconers of the night\r\nbefore stood in the midst of a pack of hounds. A curved horn was strapped\r\nover his back, and in his hand he held a long-lashed whip. The dogs\r\nwhined and yelped, dancing around him in anticipation; there was the\r\nstamp of horses, too, in the walled yard.\r\n\r\n"Mount!" cried a voice in Breton, and with a clatter of hoofs the two\r\nfalconers, with falcons upon their wrists, rode into the courtyard among\r\nthe hounds. Then I heard another voice which sent the blood throbbing\r\nthrough my heart: "Piriou Louis, hunt the hounds well and spare neither\r\nspur nor whip. Thou Raoul and thou Gaston, see that the _epervier_\r\ndoes not prove himself _niais_, and if it be best in your judgment,\r\n_faites courtoisie a l\'oiseau. Jardiner un oiseau_, like the\r\n_mue_ there on Hastur\'s wrist, is not difficult, but thou, Raoul,\r\nmayest not find it so simple to govern that _hagard_. Twice last\r\nweek he foamed _au vif_ and lost the _beccade_ although he is\r\nused to the _leurre_. The bird acts like a stupid _branchier.\r\nPaitre un hagard n\'est pas si facile."_\r\n\r\nWas I dreaming? The old language of falconry which I had read in yellow\r\nmanuscripts--the old forgotten French of the middle ages was sounding in\r\nmy ears while the hounds bayed and the hawks\' bells tinkled accompaniment\r\nto the stamping horses. She spoke again in the sweet forgotten language:\r\n\r\n"If you would rather attach the _longe_ and leave thy _hagard au\r\nbloc_, Raoul, I shall say nothing; for it were a pity to spoil so fair\r\na day\'s sport with an ill-trained _sors_. _Essimer abaisser_,--it is\r\npossibly the best way. _Ca lui donnera des reins._ I was perhaps hasty\r\nwith the bird. It takes time to pass _a la filiere_ and the exercises\r\n_d\'escap_."\r\n\r\nThen the falconer Raoul bowed in his stirrups and replied: "If it be the\r\npleasure of Mademoiselle, I shall keep the hawk."\r\n\r\n"It is my wish," she answered. "Falconry I know, but you have yet to give\r\nme many a lesson in _Autourserie_, my poor Raoul. Sieur Piriou Louis\r\nmount!"\r\n\r\nThe huntsman sprang into an archway and in an instant returned, mounted\r\nupon a strong black horse, followed by a piqueur also mounted.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" she cried joyously, "speed Glemarec Rene! speed! speed all! Sound\r\nthy horn, Sieur Piriou!"\r\n\r\nThe silvery music of the hunting-horn filled the courtyard, the hounds\r\nsprang through the gateway and galloping hoof-beats plunged out of the\r\npaved court; loud on the drawbridge, suddenly muffled, then lost in the\r\nheather and bracken of the moors. Distant and more distant sounded the\r\nhorn, until it became so faint that the sudden carol of a soaring lark\r\ndrowned it in my ears. I heard the voice below responding to some call\r\nfrom within the house.\r\n\r\n"I do not regret the chase, I will go another time Courtesy to the\r\nstranger, Pelagie, remember!"\r\n\r\nAnd a feeble voice came quavering from within the house,\r\n"_Courtoisie_."\r\n\r\nI stripped, and rubbed myself from head to foot in the huge earthen basin\r\nof icy water which stood upon the stone floor at the foot of my bed. Then\r\nI looked about for my clothes. They were gone, but on a settle near the\r\ndoor lay a heap of garments which I inspected with astonishment. As my\r\nclothes had vanished, I was compelled to attire myself in the costume\r\nwhich had evidently been placed there for me to wear while my own clothes\r\ndried. Everything was there, cap, shoes, and hunting doublet of silvery\r\ngrey homespun; but the close-fitting costume and seamless shoes belonged\r\nto another century, and I remembered the strange costumes of the three\r\nfalconers in the court-yard. I was sure that it was not the modern dress\r\nof any portion of France or Brittany; but not until I was dressed and\r\nstood before a mirror between the windows did I realize that I was\r\nclothed much more like a young huntsman of the middle ages than like a\r\nBreton of that day. I hesitated and picked up the cap. Should I go down\r\nand present myself in that strange guise? There seemed to be no help for\r\nit, my own clothes were gone and there was no bell in the ancient chamber\r\nto call a servant; so I contented myself with removing a short hawk\'s\r\nfeather from the cap, and, opening the door, went downstairs.\r\n\r\nBy the fireplace in the large room at the foot of the stairs an old\r\nBreton woman sat spinning with a distaff. She looked up at me when I\r\nappeared, and, smiling frankly, wished me health in the Breton language,\r\nto which I laughingly replied in French. At the same moment my hostess\r\nappeared and returned my salutation with a grace and dignity that sent a\r\nthrill to my heart. Her lovely head with its dark curly hair was crowned\r\nwith a head-dress which set all doubts as to the epoch of my own costume\r\nat rest. Her slender figure was exquisitely set off in the homespun\r\nhunting-gown edged with silver, and on her gauntlet-covered wrist she\r\nbore one of her petted hawks. With perfect simplicity she took my hand\r\nand led me into the garden in the court, and seating herself before a\r\ntable invited me very sweetly to sit beside her. Then she asked me in her\r\nsoft quaint accent how I had passed the night, and whether I was very\r\nmuch inconvenienced by wearing the clothes which old Pelagie had put\r\nthere for me while I slept. I looked at my own clothes and shoes, drying\r\nin the sun by the garden-wall, and hated them. What horrors they were\r\ncompared with the graceful costume which I now wore! I told her this\r\nlaughing, but she agreed with me very seriously.\r\n\r\n"We will throw them away," she said in a quiet voice. In my astonishment\r\nI attempted to explain that I not only could not think of accepting\r\nclothes from anybody, although for all I knew it might be the custom of\r\nhospitality in that part of the country, but that I should cut an\r\nimpossible figure if I returned to France clothed as I was then.\r\n\r\nShe laughed and tossed her pretty head, saying something in old French\r\nwhich I did not understand, and then Pelagie trotted out with a tray on\r\nwhich stood two bowls of milk, a loaf of white bread, fruit, a platter of\r\nhoney-comb, and a flagon of deep red wine. "You see I have not yet broken\r\nmy fast because I wished you to eat with me. But I am very hungry," she\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\n"I would rather die than forget one word of what you have said!" I\r\nblurted out, while my cheeks burned. "She will think me mad," I added to\r\nmyself, but she turned to me with sparkling eyes.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" she murmured. "Then Monsieur knows all that there is of chivalry--"\r\n\r\nShe crossed herself and broke bread. I sat and watched her white hands,\r\nnot daring to raise my eyes to hers.\r\n\r\n"Will you not eat?" she asked. "Why do you look so troubled?"\r\n\r\nAh, why? I knew it now. I knew I would give my life to touch with my lips\r\nthose rosy palms--I understood now that from the moment when I looked\r\ninto her dark eyes there on the moor last night I had loved her. My great\r\nand sudden passion held me speechless.\r\n\r\n"Are you ill at ease?" she asked again.\r\n\r\nThen, like a man who pronounces his own doom, I answered in a low voice:\r\n"Yes, I am ill at ease for love of you." And as she did not stir nor\r\nanswer, the same power moved my lips in spite of me and I said, "I, who\r\nam unworthy of the lightest of your thoughts, I who abuse hospitality and\r\nrepay your gentle courtesy with bold presumption, I love you."\r\n\r\nShe leaned her head upon her hands, and answered softly, "I love you.\r\nYour words are very dear to me. I love you."\r\n\r\n"Then I shall win you."\r\n\r\n"Win me," she replied.\r\n\r\nBut all the time I had been sitting silent, my face turned toward her.\r\nShe, also silent, her sweet face resting on her upturned palm, sat facing\r\nme, and as her eyes looked into mine I knew that neither she nor I had\r\nspoken human speech; but I knew that her soul had answered mine, and I\r\ndrew myself up feeling youth and joyous love coursing through every vein.\r\nShe, with a bright colour in her lovely face, seemed as one awakened from\r\na dream, and her eyes sought mine with a questioning glance which made me\r\ntremble with delight. We broke our fast, speaking of ourselves. I told\r\nher my name and she told me hers, the Demoiselle Jeanne d\'Ys.\r\n\r\nShe spoke of her father and mother\'s death, and how the nineteen of her\r\nyears had been passed in the little fortified farm alone with her nurse\r\nPelagie, Glemarec Rene the piqueur, and the four falconers, Raoul,\r\nGaston, Hastur, and the Sieur Piriou Louis, who had served her father.\r\nShe had never been outside the moorland--never even had seen a human soul\r\nbefore, except the falconers and Pelagie. She did not know how she had\r\nheard of Kerselec; perhaps the falconers had spoken of it. She knew the\r\nlegends of Loup Garou and Jeanne la Flamme from her nurse Pelagie. She\r\nembroidered and spun flax. Her hawks and hounds were her only\r\ndistraction. When she had met me there on the moor she had been so\r\nfrightened that she almost dropped at the sound of my voice. She had, it\r\nwas true, seen ships at sea from the cliffs, but as far as the eye could\r\nreach the moors over which she galloped were destitute of any sign of\r\nhuman life. There was a legend which old Pelagie told, how anybody once\r\nlost in the unexplored moorland might never return, because the moors\r\nwere enchanted. She did not know whether it was true, she never had\r\nthought about it until she met me. She did not know whether the falconers\r\nhad even been outside, or whether they could go if they would. The books\r\nin the house which Pelagie, the nurse, had taught her to read were\r\nhundreds of years old.\r\n\r\nAll this she told me with a sweet seriousness seldom seen in any one but\r\nchildren. My own name she found easy to pronounce, and insisted, because\r\nmy first name was Philip, I must have French blood in me. She did not\r\nseem curious to learn anything about the outside world, and I thought\r\nperhaps she considered it had forfeited her interest and respect from the\r\nstories of her nurse.\r\n\r\nWe were still sitting at the table, and she was throwing grapes to the\r\nsmall field birds which came fearlessly to our very feet.\r\n\r\nI began to speak in a vague way of going, but she would not hear of it,\r\nand before I knew it I had promised to stay a week and hunt with hawk and\r\nhound in their company. I also obtained permission to come again from\r\nKerselec and visit her after my return.\r\n\r\n"Why," she said innocently, "I do not know what I should do if you never\r\ncame back;" and I, knowing that I had no right to awaken her with the\r\nsudden shock which the avowal of my own love would bring to her, sat\r\nsilent, hardly daring to breathe.\r\n\r\n"You will come very often?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Very often," I said.\r\n\r\n"Every day?"\r\n\r\n"Every day."\r\n\r\n"Oh," she sighed, "I am very happy. Come and see my hawks."\r\n\r\nShe rose and took my hand again with a childlike innocence of possession,\r\nand we walked through the garden and fruit trees to a grassy lawn which\r\nwas bordered by a brook. Over the lawn were scattered fifteen or twenty\r\nstumps of trees--partially imbedded in the grass--and upon all of these\r\nexcept two sat falcons. They were attached to the stumps by thongs which\r\nwere in turn fastened with steel rivets to their legs just above the\r\ntalons. A little stream of pure spring water flowed in a winding course\r\nwithin easy distance of each perch.\r\n\r\nThe birds set up a clamour when the girl appeared, but she went from one\r\nto another, caressing some, taking others for an instant upon her wrist,\r\nor stooping to adjust their jesses.\r\n\r\n"Are they not pretty?" she said. "See, here is a falcon-gentil. We call\r\nit \'ignoble,\' because it takes the quarry in direct chase. This is a blue\r\nfalcon. In falconry we call it \'noble\' because it rises over the quarry,\r\nand wheeling, drops upon it from above. This white bird is a gerfalcon\r\nfrom the north. It is also \'noble!\' Here is a merlin, and this tiercelet\r\nis a falcon-heroner."\r\n\r\nI asked her how she had learned the old language of falconry. She did not\r\nremember, but thought her father must have taught it to her when she was\r\nvery young.\r\n\r\nThen she led me away and showed me the young falcons still in the nest.\r\n"They are termed _niais_ in falconry," she explained. "A\r\n_branchier_ is the young bird which is just able to leave the nest\r\nand hop from branch to branch. A young bird which has not yet moulted is\r\ncalled a _sors_, and a _mue_ is a hawk which has moulted in\r\ncaptivity. When we catch a wild falcon which has changed its plumage we\r\nterm it a _hagard_. Raoul first taught me to dress a falcon. Shall I\r\nteach you how it is done?"\r\n\r\nShe seated herself on the bank of the stream among the falcons and I\r\nthrew myself at her feet to listen.\r\n\r\nThen the Demoiselle d\'Ys held up one rosy-tipped finger and began very\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n"First one must catch the falcon."\r\n\r\n"I am caught," I answered.\r\n\r\nShe laughed very prettily and told me my _dressage_ would perhaps be\r\ndifficult, as I was noble.\r\n\r\n"I am already tamed," I replied; "jessed and belled."\r\n\r\nShe laughed, delighted. "Oh, my brave falcon; then you will return at my\r\ncall?"\r\n\r\n"I am yours," I answered gravely.\r\n\r\nShe sat silent for a moment. Then the colour heightened in her cheeks and\r\nshe held up her finger again, saying, "Listen; I wish to speak of\r\nfalconry--"\r\n\r\n"I listen, Countess Jeanne d\'Ys."\r\n\r\nBut again she fell into the reverie, and her eyes seemed fixed on\r\nsomething beyond the summer clouds.\r\n\r\n"Philip," she said at last.\r\n\r\n"Jeanne," I whispered.\r\n\r\n"That is all,--that is what I wished," she sighed,--"Philip and Jeanne."\r\n\r\nShe held her hand toward me and I touched it with my lips.\r\n\r\n"Win me," she said, but this time it was the body and soul which spoke in\r\nunison.\r\n\r\nAfter a while she began again: "Let us speak of falconry."\r\n\r\n"Begin," I replied; "we have caught the falcon."\r\n\r\nThen Jeanne d\'Ys took my hand in both of hers and told me how with\r\ninfinite patience the young falcon was taught to perch upon the wrist,\r\nhow little by little it became used to the belled jesses and the\r\n_chaperon a cornette_.\r\n\r\n"They must first have a good appetite," she said; "then little by little\r\nI reduce their nourishment; which in falconry we call _pat_. When,\r\nafter many nights passed _au bloc_ as these birds are now, I prevail\r\nupon the _hagard_ to stay quietly on the wrist, then the bird is\r\nready to be taught to come for its food. I fix the _pat_ to the end\r\nof a thong, or _leurre_, and teach the bird to come to me as soon as\r\nI begin to whirl the cord in circles about my head. At first I drop the\r\n_pat_ when the falcon comes, and he eats the food on the ground.\r\nAfter a little he will learn to seize the _leurre_ in motion as I\r\nwhirl it around my head or drag it over the ground. After this it is easy\r\nto teach the falcon to strike at game, always remembering to _\'faire\r\ncourtoisie a l\'oiseau\'_, that is, to allow the bird to taste the\r\nquarry."\r\n\r\nA squeal from one of the falcons interrupted her, and she arose to adjust\r\nthe _longe_ which had become whipped about the _bloc_, but the\r\nbird still flapped its wings and screamed.\r\n\r\n"What _is_ the matter?" she said. "Philip, can you see?"\r\n\r\nI looked around and at first saw nothing to cause the commotion, which\r\nwas now heightened by the screams and flapping of all the birds. Then my\r\neye fell upon the flat rock beside the stream from which the girl had\r\nrisen. A grey serpent was moving slowly across the surface of the\r\nboulder, and the eyes in its flat triangular head sparkled like jet.\r\n\r\n"A couleuvre," she said quietly.\r\n\r\n"It is harmless, is it not?" I asked.\r\n\r\nShe pointed to the black V-shaped figure on the neck.\r\n\r\n"It is certain death," she said; "it is a viper."\r\n\r\nWe watched the reptile moving slowly over the smooth rock to where the\r\nsunlight fell in a broad warm patch.\r\n\r\nI started forward to examine it, but she clung to my arm crying, "Don\'t,\r\nPhilip, I am afraid."\r\n\r\n"For me?"\r\n\r\n"For you, Philip,--I love you."\r\n\r\nThen I took her in my arms and kissed her on the lips, but all I could\r\nsay was: "Jeanne, Jeanne, Jeanne." And as she lay trembling on my breast,\r\nsomething struck my foot in the grass below, but I did not heed it. Then\r\nagain something struck my ankle, and a sharp pain shot through me. I\r\nlooked into the sweet face of Jeanne d\'Ys and kissed her, and with all my\r\nstrength lifted her in my arms and flung her from me. Then bending, I\r\ntore the viper from my ankle and set my heel upon its head. I remember\r\nfeeling weak and numb,--I remember falling to the ground. Through my\r\nslowly glazing eyes I saw Jeanne\'s white face bending close to mine, and\r\nwhen the light in my eyes went out I still felt her arms about my neck,\r\nand her soft cheek against my drawn lips.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I opened my eyes, I looked around in terror. Jeanne was gone. I saw\r\nthe stream and the flat rock; I saw the crushed viper in the grass beside\r\nme, but the hawks and _blocs_ had disappeared. I sprang to my feet.\r\nThe garden, the fruit trees, the drawbridge and the walled court were\r\ngone. I stared stupidly at a heap of crumbling ruins, ivy-covered and\r\ngrey, through which great trees had pushed their way. I crept forward,\r\ndragging my numbed foot, and as I moved, a falcon sailed from the\r\ntree-tops among the ruins, and soaring, mounting in narrowing circles,\r\nfaded and vanished in the clouds above.\r\n\r\n"Jeanne, Jeanne," I cried, but my voice died on my lips, and I fell on my\r\nknees among the weeds. And as God willed it, I, not knowing, had fallen\r\nkneeling before a crumbling shrine carved in stone for our Mother of\r\nSorrows. I saw the sad face of the Virgin wrought in the cold stone. I\r\nsaw the cross and thorns at her feet, and beneath it I read:\r\n\r\n  "PRAY FOR THE SOUL OF THE\r\n  DEMOISELLE JEANNE D\'Ys,\r\n  WHO DIED\r\n  IN HER YOUTH FOR LOVE OF\r\n  PHILIP, A STRANGER.\r\n  A.D. 1573."\r\n\r\nBut upon the icy slab lay a woman\'s glove still warm and fragrant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROPHETS\' PARADISE\r\n\r\n  "If but the Vine and Love Abjuring Band\r\n  Are in the Prophets\' Paradise to stand,\r\n  Alack, I doubt the Prophets\' Paradise,\r\n  Were empty as the hollow of one\'s hand."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STUDIO\r\n\r\nHe smiled, saying, "Seek her throughout the world."\r\n\r\nI said, "Why tell me of the world? My world is here, between these walls\r\nand the sheet of glass above; here among gilded flagons and dull jewelled\r\narms, tarnished frames and canvasses, black chests and high-backed\r\nchairs, quaintly carved and stained in blue and gold."\r\n\r\n"For whom do you wait?" he said, and I answered, "When she comes I shall\r\nknow her."\r\n\r\nOn my hearth a tongue of flame whispered secrets to the whitening ashes.\r\nIn the street below I heard footsteps, a voice, and a song.\r\n\r\n"For whom then do you wait?" he said, and I answered, "I shall know her."\r\n\r\nFootsteps, a voice, and a song in the street below, and I knew the song\r\nbut neither the steps nor the voice.\r\n\r\n"Fool!" he cried, "the song is the same, the voice and steps have but\r\nchanged with years!"\r\n\r\nOn the hearth a tongue of flame whispered above the whitening ashes:\r\n"Wait no more; they have passed, the steps and the voice in the street\r\nbelow."\r\n\r\nThen he smiled, saying, "For whom do you wait? Seek her throughout the\r\nworld!"\r\n\r\nI answered, "My world is here, between these walls and the sheet of glass\r\nabove; here among gilded flagons and dull jewelled arms, tarnished frames\r\nand canvasses, black chests and high-backed chairs, quaintly carved and\r\nstained in blue and gold."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHANTOM\r\n\r\nThe Phantom of the Past would go no further.\r\n\r\n"If it is true," she sighed, "that you find in me a friend, let us turn\r\nback together. You will forget, here, under the summer sky."\r\n\r\nI held her close, pleading, caressing; I seized her, white with anger,\r\nbut she resisted.\r\n\r\n"If it is true," she sighed, "that you find in me a friend, let us turn\r\nback together."\r\n\r\nThe Phantom of the Past would go no further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SACRIFICE\r\n\r\nI went into a field of flowers, whose petals are whiter than snow and\r\nwhose hearts are pure gold.\r\n\r\nFar afield a woman cried, "I have killed him I loved!" and from a jar she\r\npoured blood upon the flowers whose petals are whiter than snow and whose\r\nhearts are pure gold.\r\n\r\nFar afield I followed, and on the jar I read a thousand names, while from\r\nwithin the fresh blood bubbled to the brim.\r\n\r\n"I have killed him I loved!" she cried. "The world\'s athirst; now let it\r\ndrink!" She passed, and far afield I watched her pouring blood upon the\r\nflowers whose petals are whiter than snow and whose hearts are pure gold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESTINY\r\n\r\nI came to the bridge which few may pass.\r\n\r\n"Pass!" cried the keeper, but I laughed, saying, "There is time;" and he\r\nsmiled and shut the gates.\r\n\r\nTo the bridge which few may pass came young and old. All were refused.\r\nIdly I stood and counted them, until, wearied of their noise and\r\nlamentations, I came again to the bridge which few may pass.\r\n\r\nThose in the throng about the gates shrieked out, "He comes too late!"\r\nBut I laughed, saying, "There is time."\r\n\r\n"Pass!" cried the keeper as I entered; then smiled and shut the gates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THRONG\r\n\r\nThere, where the throng was thickest in the street, I stood with Pierrot.\r\nAll eyes were turned on me.\r\n\r\n"What are they laughing at?" I asked, but he grinned, dusting the chalk\r\nfrom my black cloak. "I cannot see; it must be something droll, perhaps\r\nan honest thief!"\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned on me.\r\n\r\n"He has robbed you of your purse!" they laughed.\r\n\r\n"My purse!" I cried; "Pierrot--help! it is a thief!"\r\n\r\nThey laughed: "He has robbed you of your purse!"\r\n\r\nThen Truth stepped out, holding a mirror. "If he is an honest thief,"\r\ncried Truth, "Pierrot shall find him with this mirror!" but he only\r\ngrinned, dusting the chalk from my black cloak.\r\n\r\n"You see," he said, "Truth is an honest thief, she brings you back your\r\nmirror."\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned on me.\r\n\r\n"Arrest Truth!" I cried, forgetting it was not a mirror but a purse I\r\nlost, standing with Pierrot, there, where the throng was thickest in the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JESTER\r\n\r\n"Was she fair?" I asked, but he only chuckled, listening to the bells\r\njingling on his cap.\r\n\r\n"Stabbed," he tittered. "Think of the long journey, the days of peril,\r\nthe dreadful nights! Think how he wandered, for her sake, year after\r\nyear, through hostile lands, yearning for kith and kin, yearning for\r\nher!"\r\n\r\n"Stabbed," he tittered, listening to the bells jingling on his cap.\r\n\r\n"Was she fair?" I asked, but he only snarled, muttering to the bells\r\njingling on his cap.\r\n\r\n"She kissed him at the gate," he tittered, "but in the hall his brother\'s\r\nwelcome touched his heart."\r\n\r\n"Was she fair?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Stabbed," he chuckled. "Think of the long journey, the days of peril,\r\nthe dreadful nights! Think how he wandered, for her sake, year after year\r\nthrough hostile lands, yearning for kith and kin, yearning for her!"\r\n\r\n"She kissed him at the gate, but in the hall his brother\'s welcome\r\ntouched his heart."\r\n\r\n"Was she fair?" I asked; but he only snarled, listening to the bells\r\njingling in his cap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREEN ROOM\r\n\r\nThe Clown turned his powdered face to the mirror.\r\n\r\n"If to be fair is to be beautiful," he said, "who can compare with me in\r\nmy white mask?"\r\n\r\n"Who can compare with him in his white mask?" I asked of Death beside me.\r\n\r\n"Who can compare with me?" said Death, "for I am paler still."\r\n\r\n"You are very beautiful," sighed the Clown, turning his powdered face\r\nfrom the mirror.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOVE TEST\r\n\r\n"If it is true that you love," said Love, "then wait no longer. Give her\r\nthese jewels which would dishonour her and so dishonour you in loving\r\none dishonoured. If it is true that you love," said Love, "then wait no\r\nlonger."\r\n\r\nI took the jewels and went to her, but she trod upon them, sobbing:\r\n"Teach me to wait--I love you!"\r\n\r\n"Then wait, if it is true," said Love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STREET OF THE FOUR WINDS\r\n\r\n  "Ferme tes yeux a demi,\r\n  Croise tes bras sur ton sein,\r\n  Et de ton coeur endormi\r\n  Chasse a jamais tout dessein."\r\n\r\n  "Je chante la nature,\r\n  Les etoiles du soir, les larmes du matin,\r\n  Les couchers de soleil a l\'horizon lointain,\r\n  Le ciel qui parle au coeur d\'existence future!"\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe animal paused on the threshold, interrogative alert, ready for flight\r\nif necessary. Severn laid down his palette, and held out a hand of\r\nwelcome. The cat remained motionless, her yellow eyes fastened upon\r\nSevern.\r\n\r\n"Puss," he said, in his low, pleasant voice, "come in."\r\n\r\nThe tip of her thin tail twitched uncertainly.\r\n\r\n"Come in," he said again.\r\n\r\nApparently she found his voice reassuring, for she slowly settled upon all\r\nfours, her eyes still fastened upon him, her tail tucked under her gaunt\r\nflanks.\r\n\r\nHe rose from his easel smiling. She eyed him quietly, and when he walked\r\ntoward her she watched him bend above her without a wince; her eyes\r\nfollowed his hand until it touched her head. Then she uttered a ragged\r\nmew.\r\n\r\nIt had long been Severn\'s custom to converse with animals, probably\r\nbecause he lived so much alone; and now he said, "What\'s the matter,\r\npuss?"\r\n\r\nHer timid eyes sought his.\r\n\r\n"I understand," he said gently, "you shall have it at once."\r\n\r\nThen moving quietly about he busied himself with the duties of a host,\r\nrinsed a saucer, filled it with the rest of the milk from the bottle on\r\nthe window-sill, and kneeling down, crumbled a roll into the hollow of his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThe creature rose and crept toward the saucer.\r\n\r\nWith the handle of a palette-knife he stirred the crumbs and milk together\r\nand stepped back as she thrust her nose into the mess. He watched her in\r\nsilence. From time to time the saucer clinked upon the tiled floor as she\r\nreached for a morsel on the rim; and at last the bread was all gone, and\r\nher purple tongue travelled over every unlicked spot until the saucer\r\nshone like polished marble. Then she sat up, and coolly turning her back\r\nto him, began her ablutions.\r\n\r\n"Keep it up," said Severn, much interested, "you need it."\r\n\r\nShe flattened one ear, but neither turned nor interrupted her toilet. As\r\nthe grime was slowly removed Severn observed that nature had intended her\r\nfor a white cat. Her fur had disappeared in patches, from disease or the\r\nchances of war, her tail was bony and her spine sharp. But what charms she\r\nhad were becoming apparent under vigorous licking, and he waited until she\r\nhad finished before re-opening the conversation. When at last she closed\r\nher eyes and folded her forepaws under her breast, he began again very\r\ngently: "Puss, tell me your troubles."\r\n\r\nAt the sound of his voice she broke into a harsh rumbling which he\r\nrecognized as an attempt to purr. He bent over to rub her cheek and she\r\nmewed again, an amiable inquiring little mew, to which he replied,\r\n"Certainly, you are greatly improved, and when you recover your plumage\r\nyou will be a gorgeous bird." Much flattered, she stood up and marched\r\naround and around his legs, pushing her head between them and making\r\npleased remarks, to which he responded with grave politeness.\r\n\r\n"Now, what sent you here," he said--"here into the Street of the Four\r\nWinds, and up five flights to the very door where you would be welcome?\r\nWhat was it that prevented your meditated flight when I turned from my\r\ncanvas to encounter your yellow eyes? Are you a Latin Quarter cat as I am\r\na Latin Quarter man? And why do you wear a rose-coloured flowered garter\r\nbuckled about your neck?" The cat had climbed into his lap, and now sat\r\npurring as he passed his hand over her thin coat.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me," he continued in lazy soothing tones, harmonizing with her\r\npurring, "if I seem indelicate, but I cannot help musing on this\r\nrose-coloured garter, flowered so quaintly and fastened with a silver\r\nclasp. For the clasp is silver; I can see the mint mark on the edge, as is\r\nprescribed by the law of the French Republic. Now, why is this garter\r\nwoven of rose silk and delicately embroidered,--why is this silken garter\r\nwith its silver clasp about your famished throat? Am I indiscreet when I\r\ninquire if its owner is your owner? Is she some aged dame living in memory\r\nof youthful vanities, fond, doting on you, decorating you with her\r\nintimate personal attire? The circumference of the garter would suggest\r\nthis, for your neck is thin, and the garter fits you. But then again I\r\nnotice--I notice most things--that the garter is capable of being much\r\nenlarged. These small silver-rimmed eyelets, of which I count five, are\r\nproof of that. And now I observe that the fifth eyelet is worn out, as\r\nthough the tongue of the clasp were accustomed to lie there. That seems to\r\nargue a well-rounded form."\r\n\r\nThe cat curled her toes in contentment. The street was very still outside.\r\n\r\nHe murmured on: "Why should your mistress decorate you with an article\r\nmost necessary to her at all times? Anyway, at most times. How did she\r\ncome to slip this bit of silk and silver about your neck? Was it the\r\ncaprice of a moment,--when you, before you had lost your pristine\r\nplumpness, marched singing into her bedroom to bid her good-morning? Of\r\ncourse, and she sat up among the pillows, her coiled hair tumbling to her\r\nshoulders, as you sprang upon the bed purring: \'Good-day, my lady.\' Oh, it\r\nis very easy to understand," he yawned, resting his head on the back of\r\nthe chair. The cat still purred, tightening and relaxing her padded claws\r\nover his knee.\r\n\r\n"Shall I tell you all about her, cat? She is very beautiful--your\r\nmistress," he murmured drowsily, "and her hair is heavy as burnished\r\ngold. I could paint her,--not on canvas--for I should need shades and\r\ntones and hues and dyes more splendid than the iris of a splendid rainbow.\r\nI could only paint her with closed eyes, for in dreams alone can such\r\ncolours as I need be found. For her eyes, I must have azure from skies\r\nuntroubled by a cloud--the skies of dreamland. For her lips, roses from\r\nthe palaces of slumberland, and for her brow, snow-drifts from mountains\r\nwhich tower in fantastic pinnacles to the moons;--oh, much higher than our\r\nmoon here,--the crystal moons of dreamland. She is--very--beautiful, your\r\nmistress."\r\n\r\nThe words died on his lips and his eyelids drooped.\r\n\r\nThe cat, too, was asleep, her cheek turned up upon her wasted flank, her\r\npaws relaxed and limp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n"It is fortunate," said Severn, sitting up and stretching, "that we have\r\ntided over the dinner hour, for I have nothing to offer you for supper but\r\nwhat may be purchased with one silver franc."\r\n\r\nThe cat on his knee rose, arched her back, yawned, and looked up at him.\r\n\r\n"What shall it be? A roast chicken with salad? No? Possibly you prefer\r\nbeef? Of course,--and I shall try an egg and some white bread. Now for the\r\nwines. Milk for you? Good. I shall take a little water, fresh from the\r\nwood," with a motion toward the bucket in the sink.\r\n\r\nHe put on his hat and left the room. The cat followed to the door, and\r\nafter he had closed it behind him, she settled down, smelling at the\r\ncracks, and cocking one ear at every creak from the crazy old building.\r\n\r\nThe door below opened and shut. The cat looked serious, for a moment\r\ndoubtful, and her ears flattened in nervous expectation. Presently she\r\nrose with a jerk of her tail and started on a noiseless tour of the\r\nstudio. She sneezed at a pot of turpentine, hastily retreating to the\r\ntable, which she presently mounted, and having satisfied her curiosity\r\nconcerning a roll of red modelling wax, returned to the door and sat down\r\nwith her eyes on the crack over the threshold Then she lifted her voice in\r\na thin plaint.\r\n\r\nWhen Severn returned he looked grave, but the cat, joyous and\r\ndemonstrative, marched around him, rubbing her gaunt body against his\r\nlegs, driving her head enthusiastically into his hand, and purring until\r\nher voice mounted to a squeal.\r\n\r\nHe placed a bit of meat, wrapped in brown paper, upon the table, and with\r\na penknife cut it into shreds. The milk he took from a bottle which had\r\nserved for medicine, and poured it into the saucer on the hearth.\r\n\r\nThe cat crouched before it, purring and lapping at the same time.\r\n\r\nHe cooked his egg and ate it with a slice of bread, watching her busy with\r\nthe shredded meat, and when he had finished, and had filled and emptied a\r\ncup of water from the bucket in the sink, he sat down, taking her into his\r\nlap, where she at once curled up and began her toilet. He began to speak\r\nagain, touching her caressingly at times by way of emphasis.\r\n\r\n"Cat, I have found out where your mistress lives. It is not very far\r\naway;--it is here, under this same leaky roof, but in the north wing which\r\nI had supposed was uninhabited. My janitor tells me this. By chance, he is\r\nalmost sober this evening. The butcher on the rue de Seine, where I bought\r\nyour meat, knows you, and old Cabane the baker identified you with\r\nneedless sarcasm. They tell me hard tales of your mistress which I shall\r\nnot believe. They say she is idle and vain and pleasure-loving; they say\r\nshe is hare-brained and reckless. The little sculptor on the ground floor,\r\nwho was buying rolls from old Cabane, spoke to me to-night for the first\r\ntime, although we have always bowed to each other. He said she was very\r\ngood and very beautiful. He has only seen her once, and does not know her\r\nname. I thanked him;--I don\'t know why I thanked him so warmly. Cabane\r\nsaid, \'Into this cursed Street of the Four Winds, the four winds blow all\r\nthings evil.\' The sculptor looked confused, but when he went out with his\r\nrolls, he said to me, \'I am sure, Monsieur, that she is as good as she is\r\nbeautiful.\'"\r\n\r\nThe cat had finished her toilet, and now, springing softly to the floor,\r\nwent to the door and sniffed. He knelt beside her, and unclasping the\r\ngarter held it for a moment in his hands. After a while he said: "There is\r\na name engraved upon the silver clasp beneath the buckle. It is a pretty\r\nname, Sylvia Elven. Sylvia is a woman\'s name, Elven is the name of a town.\r\nIn Paris, in this quarter, above all, in this Street of the Four Winds,\r\nnames are worn and put away as the fashions change with the seasons. I\r\nknow the little town of Elven, for there I met Fate face to face and Fate\r\nwas unkind. But do you know that in Elven Fate had another name, and that\r\nname was Sylvia?"\r\n\r\nHe replaced the garter and stood up looking down at the cat crouched\r\nbefore the closed door.\r\n\r\n"The name of Elven has a charm for me. It tells me of meadows and clear\r\nrivers. The name of Sylvia troubles me like perfume from dead flowers."\r\n\r\nThe cat mewed.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," he said soothingly, "I will take you back. Your Sylvia is not\r\nmy Sylvia; the world is wide and Elven is not unknown. Yet in the darkness\r\nand filth of poorer Paris, in the sad shadows of this ancient house, these\r\nnames are very pleasant to me."\r\n\r\nHe lifted her in his arms and strode through the silent corridors to the\r\nstairs. Down five flights and into the moonlit court, past the little\r\nsculptor\'s den, and then again in at the gate of the north wing and up the\r\nworm-eaten stairs he passed, until he came to a closed door. When he had\r\nstood knocking for a long time, something moved behind the door; it opened\r\nand he went in. The room was dark. As he crossed the threshold, the cat\r\nsprang from his arms into the shadows. He listened but heard nothing. The\r\nsilence was oppressive and he struck a match. At his elbow stood a table\r\nand on the table a candle in a gilded candlestick. This he lighted, then\r\nlooked around. The chamber was vast, the hangings heavy with embroidery.\r\nOver the fireplace towered a carved mantel, grey with the ashes of dead\r\nfires. In a recess by the deep-set windows stood a bed, from which the\r\nbedclothes, soft and fine as lace, trailed to the polished floor. He\r\nlifted the candle above his head. A handkerchief lay at his feet. It was\r\nfaintly perfumed. He turned toward the windows. In front of them was a\r\n_canape_ and over it were flung, pell-mell, a gown of silk, a heap of\r\nlace-like garments, white and delicate as spiders\' meshes, long, crumpled\r\ngloves, and, on the floor beneath, the stockings, the little pointed\r\nshoes, and one garter of rosy silk, quaintly flowered and fitted with a\r\nsilver clasp. Wondering, he stepped forward and drew the heavy curtains\r\nfrom the bed. For a moment the candle flared in his hand; then his eyes\r\nmet two other eyes, wide open, smiling, and the candle-flame flashed over\r\nhair heavy as gold.\r\n\r\nShe was pale, but not as white as he; her eyes were untroubled as a\r\nchild\'s; but he stared, trembling from head to foot, while the candle\r\nflickered in his hand.\r\n\r\nAt last he whispered: "Sylvia, it is I."\r\n\r\nAgain he said, "It is I."\r\n\r\nThen, knowing that she was dead, he kissed her on the mouth. And through\r\nthe long watches of the night the cat purred on his knee, tightening and\r\nrelaxing her padded claws, until the sky paled above the Street of the\r\nFour Winds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STREET OF THE FIRST SHELL\r\n\r\n\r\n  "Be of Good Cheer, the Sullen Month will die,\r\n  And a young Moon requite us by and by:\r\n  Look how the Old one, meagre, bent, and wan\r\n  With age and Fast, is fainting from the sky."\r\n\r\nThe room was already dark. The high roofs opposite cut off what little\r\nremained of the December daylight. The girl drew her chair nearer the\r\nwindow, and choosing a large needle, threaded it, knotting the thread over\r\nher fingers. Then she smoothed the baby garment across her knees, and\r\nbending, bit off the thread and drew the smaller needle from where it\r\nrested in the hem. When she had brushed away the stray threads and bits of\r\nlace, she laid it again over her knees caressingly. Then she slipped the\r\nthreaded needle from her corsage and passed it through a button, but as\r\nthe button spun down the thread, her hand faltered, the thread snapped,\r\nand the button rolled across the floor. She raised her head. Her eyes were\r\nfixed on a strip of waning light above the chimneys. From somewhere in the\r\ncity came sounds like the distant beating of drums, and beyond, far\r\nbeyond, a vague muttering, now growing, swelling, rumbling in the distance\r\nlike the pounding of surf upon the rocks, now like the surf again,\r\nreceding, growling, menacing. The cold had become intense, a bitter\r\npiercing cold which strained and snapped at joist and beam and turned the\r\nslush of yesterday to flint. From the street below every sound broke sharp\r\nand metallic--the clatter of sabots, the rattle of shutters or the rare\r\nsound of a human voice. The air was heavy, weighted with the black cold as\r\nwith a pall. To breathe was painful, to move an effort.\r\n\r\nIn the desolate sky there was something that wearied, in the brooding\r\nclouds, something that saddened. It penetrated the freezing city cut by\r\nthe freezing river, the splendid city with its towers and domes, its quays\r\nand bridges and its thousand spires. It entered the squares, it seized the\r\navenues and the palaces, stole across bridges and crept among the narrow\r\nstreets of the Latin Quarter, grey under the grey of the December sky.\r\nSadness, utter sadness. A fine icy sleet was falling, powdering the\r\npavement with a tiny crystalline dust. It sifted against the window-panes\r\nand drifted in heaps along the sill. The light at the window had nearly\r\nfailed, and the girl bent low over her work. Presently she raised her\r\nhead, brushing the curls from her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Jack?"\r\n\r\n"Dearest?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t forget to clean your palette."\r\n\r\nHe said, "All right," and picking up the palette, sat down upon the floor\r\nin front of the stove. His head and shoulders were in the shadow, but the\r\nfirelight fell across his knees and glimmered red on the blade of the\r\npalette-knife. Full in the firelight beside him stood a colour-box. On the\r\nlid was carved,\r\n\r\n  J. TRENT.\r\n  Ecole des Beaux Arts.\r\n  1870.\r\n\r\nThis inscription was ornamented with an American and a French flag.\r\n\r\nThe sleet blew against the window-panes, covering them with stars and\r\ndiamonds, then, melting from the warmer air within, ran down and froze\r\nagain in fern-like traceries.\r\n\r\nA dog whined and the patter of small paws sounded on the zinc behind the\r\nstove.\r\n\r\n"Jack, dear, do you think Hercules is hungry?"\r\n\r\nThe patter of paws was redoubled behind the stove.\r\n\r\n"He\'s whining," she continued nervously, "and if it isn\'t because he\'s\r\nhungry it is because--"\r\n\r\nHer voice faltered. A loud humming filled the air, the windows vibrated.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Jack," she cried, "another--" but her voice was drowned in the scream\r\nof a shell tearing through the clouds overhead.\r\n\r\n"That is the nearest yet," she murmured.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," he answered cheerfully, "it probably fell way over by\r\nMontmartre," and as she did not answer, he said again with exaggerated\r\nunconcern, "They wouldn\'t take the trouble to fire at the Latin Quarter;\r\nanyway they haven\'t a battery that can hurt it."\r\n\r\nAfter a while she spoke up brightly: "Jack, dear, when are you going to\r\ntake me to see Monsieur West\'s statues?"\r\n\r\n"I will bet," he said, throwing down his palette and walking over to the\r\nwindow beside her, "that Colette has been here to-day."\r\n\r\n"Why?" she asked, opening her eyes very wide. Then, "Oh, it\'s too\r\nbad!--really, men are tiresome when they think they know everything! And I\r\nwarn you that if Monsieur West is vain enough to imagine that Colette--"\r\n\r\nFrom the north another shell came whistling and quavering through the sky,\r\npassing above them with long-drawn screech which left the windows singing.\r\n\r\n"That," he blurted out, "was too near for comfort."\r\n\r\nThey were silent for a while, then he spoke again gaily: "Go on, Sylvia,\r\nand wither poor West;" but she only sighed, "Oh, dear, I can never seem to\r\nget used to the shells."\r\n\r\nHe sat down on the arm of the chair beside her.\r\n\r\nHer scissors fell jingling to the floor; she tossed the unfinished frock\r\nafter them, and putting both arms about his neck drew him down into her\r\nlap.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t go out to-night, Jack."\r\n\r\nHe kissed her uplifted face; "You know I must; don\'t make it hard for me."\r\n\r\n"But when I hear the shells and--and know you are out in the city--"\r\n\r\n"But they all fall in Montmartre--"\r\n\r\n"They may all fall in the Beaux Arts; you said yourself that two struck\r\nthe Quai d\'Orsay--"\r\n\r\n"Mere accident--"\r\n\r\n"Jack, have pity on me! Take me with you!"\r\n\r\n"And who will there be to get dinner?"\r\n\r\nShe rose and flung herself on the bed.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I can\'t get used to it, and I know you must go, but I beg you not to\r\nbe late to dinner. If you knew what I suffer! I--I--cannot help it, and\r\nyou must be patient with me, dear."\r\n\r\nHe said, "It is as safe there as it is in our own house."\r\n\r\nShe watched him fill for her the alcohol lamp, and when he had lighted it\r\nand had taken his hat to go, she jumped up and clung to him in silence.\r\nAfter a moment he said: "Now, Sylvia, remember my courage is sustained by\r\nyours. Come, I must go!" She did not move, and he repeated: "I must go."\r\nThen she stepped back and he thought she was going to speak and waited,\r\nbut she only looked at him, and, a little impatiently, he kissed her\r\nagain, saying: "Don\'t worry, dearest."\r\n\r\nWhen he had reached the last flight of stairs on his way to the street a\r\nwoman hobbled out of the house-keeper\'s lodge waving a letter and calling:\r\n"Monsieur Jack! Monsieur Jack! this was left by Monsieur Fallowby!"\r\n\r\nHe took the letter, and leaning on the threshold of the lodge, read it:\r\n\r\n"Dear Jack,\r\n\r\n"I believe Braith is dead broke and I\'m sure Fallowby is. Braith swears he\r\nisn\'t, and Fallowby swears he is, so you can draw your own conclusions.\r\nI\'ve got a scheme for a dinner, and if it works, I will let you fellows\r\nin.\r\n\r\n"Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n"West.\r\n\r\n"P.S.--Fallowby has shaken Hartman and his gang, thank the Lord! There is\r\nsomething rotten there,--or it may be he\'s only a miser.\r\n\r\n"P.P.S.--I\'m more desperately in love than ever, but I\'m sure she does not\r\ncare a straw for me."\r\n\r\n"All right," said Trent, with a smile, to the concierge; "but tell me, how\r\nis Papa Cottard?"\r\n\r\nThe old woman shook her head and pointed to the curtained bed in the\r\nlodge.\r\n\r\n"Pere Cottard!" he cried cheerily, "how goes the wound to-day?"\r\n\r\nHe walked over to the bed and drew the curtains. An old man was lying\r\namong the tumbled sheets.\r\n\r\n"Better?" smiled Trent.\r\n\r\n"Better," repeated the man wearily; and, after a pause, "Have you any\r\nnews, Monsieur Jack?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t been out to-day. I will bring you any rumour I may hear, though\r\ngoodness knows I\'ve got enough of rumours," he muttered to himself. Then\r\naloud: "Cheer up; you\'re looking better."\r\n\r\n"And the sortie?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, the sortie, that\'s for this week. General Trochu sent orders last\r\nnight."\r\n\r\n"It will be terrible."\r\n\r\n"It will be sickening," thought Trent as he went not into the street and\r\nturned the corner toward the rue de Seine; "slaughter, slaughter, phew!\r\nI\'m glad I\'m not going."\r\n\r\nThe street was almost deserted. A few women muffled in tattered military\r\ncapes crept along the frozen pavement, and a wretchedly clad gamin hovered\r\nover the sewer-hole on the corner of the Boulevard. A rope around his\r\nwaist held his rags together. From the rope hung a rat, still warm and\r\nbleeding.\r\n\r\n"There\'s another in there," he yelled at Trent; "I hit him but he got\r\naway."\r\n\r\nTrent crossed the street and asked: "How much?"\r\n\r\n"Two francs for a quarter of a fat one; that\'s what they give at the St.\r\nGermain Market."\r\n\r\nA violent fit of coughing interrupted him, but he wiped his face with the\r\npalm of his hand and looked cunningly at Trent.\r\n\r\n"Last week you could buy a rat for six francs, but," and here he swore\r\nvilely, "the rats have quit the rue de Seine and they kill them now over\r\nby the new hospital. I\'ll let you have this for seven francs; I can sell\r\nit for ten in the Isle St. Louis."\r\n\r\n"You lie," said Trent, "and let me tell you that if you try to swindle\r\nanybody in this quarter the people will make short work of you and your\r\nrats."\r\n\r\nHe stood a moment eyeing the gamin, who pretended to snivel. Then he\r\ntossed him a franc, laughing. The child caught it, and thrusting it into\r\nhis mouth wheeled about to the sewer-hole. For a second he crouched,\r\nmotionless, alert, his eyes on the bars of the drain, then leaping forward\r\nhe hurled a stone into the gutter, and Trent left him to finish a fierce\r\ngrey rat that writhed squealing at the mouth of the sewer.\r\n\r\n"Suppose Braith should come to that," he thought; "poor little chap;" and\r\nhurrying, he turned in the dirty passage des Beaux Arts and entered the\r\nthird house to the left.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur is at home," quavered the old concierge.\r\n\r\nHome? A garret absolutely bare, save for the iron bedstead in the corner\r\nand the iron basin and pitcher on the floor.\r\n\r\nWest appeared at the door, winking with much mystery, and motioned Trent\r\nto enter. Braith, who was painting in bed to keep warm, looked up,\r\nlaughed, and shook hands.\r\n\r\n"Any news?"\r\n\r\nThe perfunctory question was answered as usual by: "Nothing but the\r\ncannon."\r\n\r\nTrent sat down on the bed.\r\n\r\n"Where on earth did you get that?" he demanded, pointing to a\r\nhalf-finished chicken nestling in a wash-basin.\r\n\r\nWest grinned.\r\n\r\n"Are you millionaires, you two? Out with it."\r\n\r\nBraith, looking a little ashamed, began, "Oh, it\'s one of West\'s\r\nexploits," but was cut short by West, who said he would tell the story\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n"You see, before the siege, I had a letter of introduction to a \'_type_\'\r\nhere, a fat banker, German-American variety. You know the species, I see.\r\nWell, of course I forgot to present the letter, but this morning, judging\r\nit to be a favourable opportunity, I called on him.\r\n\r\n"The villain lives in comfort;--fires, my boy!--fires in the ante-rooms!\r\nThe Buttons finally condescends to carry my letter and card up, leaving me\r\nstanding in the hallway, which I did not like, so I entered the first room\r\nI saw and nearly fainted at the sight of a banquet on a table by the fire.\r\nDown comes Buttons, very insolent. No, oh, no, his master, \'is not at\r\nhome, and in fact is too busy to receive letters of introduction just now;\r\nthe siege, and many business difficulties--\'\r\n\r\n"I deliver a kick to Buttons, pick up this chicken from the table, toss my\r\ncard on to the empty plate, and addressing Buttons as a species of\r\nPrussian pig, march out with the honours of war."\r\n\r\nTrent shook his head.\r\n\r\n"I forgot to say that Hartman often dines there, and I draw my own\r\nconclusions," continued West. "Now about this chicken, half of it is for\r\nBraith and myself, and half for Colette, but of course you will help me\r\neat my part because I\'m not hungry."\r\n\r\n"Neither am I," began Braith, but Trent, with a smile at the pinched faces\r\nbefore him, shook his head saying, "What nonsense! You know I\'m never\r\nhungry!"\r\n\r\nWest hesitated, reddened, and then slicing off Braith\'s portion, but not\r\neating any himself, said good-night, and hurried away to number 470 rue\r\nSerpente, where lived a pretty girl named Colette, orphan after Sedan, and\r\nHeaven alone knew where she got the roses in her cheeks, for the siege\r\ncame hard on the poor.\r\n\r\n"That chicken will delight her, but I really believe she\'s in love with\r\nWest," said Trent. Then walking over to the bed: "See here, old man, no\r\ndodging, you know, how much have you left?"\r\n\r\nThe other hesitated and flushed.\r\n\r\n"Come, old chap," insisted Trent.\r\n\r\nBraith drew a purse from beneath his bolster, and handed it to his friend\r\nwith a simplicity that touched him.\r\n\r\n"Seven sons," he counted; "you make me tired! Why on earth don\'t you come\r\nto me? I take it d----d ill, Braith! How many times must I go over the same\r\nthing and explain to you that because I have money it is my duty to share\r\nit, and your duty and the duty of every American to share it with me? You\r\ncan\'t get a cent, the city\'s blockaded, and the American Minister has his\r\nhands full with all the German riff-raff and deuce knows what! Why don\'t\r\nyou act sensibly?"\r\n\r\n"I--I will, Trent, but it\'s an obligation that perhaps I can never even in\r\npart repay, I\'m poor and--"\r\n\r\n"Of course you\'ll pay me! If I were a usurer I would take your talent for\r\nsecurity. When you are rich and famous--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t, Trent--"\r\n\r\n"All right, only no more monkey business."\r\n\r\nHe slipped a dozen gold pieces into the purse, and tucking it again under\r\nthe mattress smiled at Braith.\r\n\r\n"How old are you?" he demanded.\r\n\r\n"Sixteen."\r\n\r\nTrent laid his hand lightly on his friend\'s shoulder. "I\'m twenty-two, and\r\nI have the rights of a grandfather as far as you are concerned. You\'ll do\r\nas I say until you\'re twenty-one."\r\n\r\n"The siege will be over then, I hope," said Braith, trying to laugh, but\r\nthe prayer in their hearts: "How long, O Lord, how long!" was answered by\r\nthe swift scream of a shell soaring among the storm-clouds of that\r\nDecember night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWest, standing in the doorway of a house in the rue Serpentine, was\r\nspeaking angrily. He said he didn\'t care whether Hartman liked it or not;\r\nhe was telling him, not arguing with him.\r\n\r\n"You call yourself an American!" he sneered; "Berlin and hell are full of\r\nthat kind of American. You come loafing about Colette with your pockets\r\nstuffed with white bread and beef, and a bottle of wine at thirty francs\r\nand you can\'t really afford to give a dollar to the American Ambulance and\r\nPublic Assistance, which Braith does, and he\'s half starved!"\r\n\r\nHartman retreated to the curbstone, but West followed him, his face like a\r\nthunder-cloud. "Don\'t you dare to call yourself a countryman of mine," he\r\ngrowled,--"no,--nor an artist either! Artists don\'t worm themselves into\r\nthe service of the Public Defence where they do nothing but feed like rats\r\non the people\'s food! And I\'ll tell you now," he continued dropping his\r\nvoice, for Hartman had started as though stung, "you might better keep\r\naway from that Alsatian Brasserie and the smug-faced thieves who haunt it.\r\nYou know what they do with suspects!"\r\n\r\n"You lie, you hound!" screamed Hartman, and flung the bottle in his hand\r\nstraight at West\'s face. West had him by the throat in a second, and\r\nforcing him against the dead wall shook him wickedly.\r\n\r\n"Now you listen to me," he muttered, through his clenched teeth. "You are\r\nalready a suspect and--I swear--I believe you are a paid spy! It isn\'t my\r\nbusiness to detect such vermin, and I don\'t intend to denounce you, but\r\nunderstand this! Colette don\'t like you and I can\'t stand you, and if I\r\ncatch you in this street again I\'ll make it somewhat unpleasant. Get out,\r\nyou sleek Prussian!"\r\n\r\nHartman had managed to drag a knife from his pocket, but West tore it from\r\nhim and hurled him into the gutter. A gamin who had seen this burst into a\r\npeal of laughter, which rattled harshly in the silent street. Then\r\neverywhere windows were raised and rows of haggard faces appeared\r\ndemanding to know why people should laugh in the starving city.\r\n\r\n"Is it a victory?" murmured one.\r\n\r\n"Look at that," cried West as Hartman picked himself up from the pavement,\r\n"look! you miser! look at those faces!" But Hartman gave _him_ a look\r\nwhich he never forgot, and walked away without a word. Trent, who suddenly\r\nappeared at the corner, glanced curiously at West, who merely nodded\r\ntoward his door saying, "Come in; Fallowby\'s upstairs."\r\n\r\n"What are you doing with that knife?" demanded Fallowby, as he and Trent\r\nentered the studio.\r\n\r\nWest looked at his wounded hand, which still clutched the knife, but\r\nsaying, "Cut myself by accident," tossed it into a corner and washed the\r\nblood from his fingers.\r\n\r\nFallowby, fat and lazy, watched him without comment, but Trent, half\r\ndivining how things had turned, walked over to Fallowby smiling.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve a bone to pick with you!" he said.\r\n\r\n"Where is it? I\'m hungry," replied Fallowby with affected eagerness, but\r\nTrent, frowning, told him to listen.\r\n\r\n"How much did I advance you a week ago?"\r\n\r\n"Three hundred and eighty francs," replied the other, with a squirm of\r\ncontrition.\r\n\r\n"Where is it?"\r\n\r\nFallowby began a series of intricate explanations, which were soon cut\r\nshort by Trent.\r\n\r\n"I know; you blew it in;--you always blow it in. I don\'t care a rap what\r\nyou did before the siege: I know you are rich and have a right to dispose\r\nof your money as you wish to, and I also know that, generally speaking, it\r\nis none of my business. But _now_ it is my business, as I have to supply\r\nthe funds until you get some more, which you won\'t until the siege is\r\nended one way or another. I wish to share what I have, but I won\'t see it\r\nthrown out of the window. Oh, yes, of course I know you will reimburse me,\r\nbut that isn\'t the question; and, anyway, it\'s the opinion of your\r\nfriends, old man, that you will not be worse off for a little abstinence\r\nfrom fleshly pleasures. You are positively a freak in this famine-cursed\r\ncity of skeletons!"\r\n\r\n"I _am_ rather stout," he admitted.\r\n\r\n"Is it true you are out of money?" demanded Trent.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am," sighed the other.\r\n\r\n"That roast sucking pig on the rue St. Honore,--is it there yet?"\r\ncontinued Trent.\r\n\r\n"Wh--at?" stammered the feeble one.\r\n\r\n"Ah--I thought so! I caught you in ecstasy before that sucking pig at\r\nleast a dozen times!"\r\n\r\nThen laughing, he presented Fallowby with a roll of twenty franc pieces\r\nsaying: "If these go for luxuries you must live on your own flesh," and\r\nwent over to aid West, who sat beside the wash-basin binding up his hand.\r\n\r\nWest suffered him to tie the knot, and then said: "You remember,\r\nyesterday, when I left you and Braith to take the chicken to Colette."\r\n\r\n"Chicken! Good heavens!" moaned Fallowby.\r\n\r\n"Chicken," repeated West, enjoying Fallowby\'s grief;--"I--that is, I must\r\nexplain that things are changed. Colette and I--are to be married--"\r\n\r\n"What--what about the chicken?" groaned Fallowby.\r\n\r\n"Shut up!" laughed Trent, and slipping his arm through West\'s, walked to\r\nthe stairway.\r\n\r\n"The poor little thing," said West, "just think, not a splinter of\r\nfirewood for a week and wouldn\'t tell me because she thought I needed\r\nit for my clay figure. Whew! When I heard it I smashed that smirking\r\nclay nymph to pieces, and the rest can freeze and be hanged!" After a\r\nmoment he added timidly: "Won\'t you call on your way down and say _bon\r\nsoir_? It\'s No. 17."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Trent, and he went out softly closing the door behind.\r\n\r\nHe stopped on the third landing, lighted a match, scanned the numbers over\r\nthe row of dingy doors, and knocked at No. 17.\r\n\r\n"C\'est toi Georges?" The door opened.\r\n\r\n"Oh, pardon, Monsieur Jack, I thought it was Monsieur West," then blushing\r\nfuriously, "Oh, I see you have heard! Oh, thank you so much for your\r\nwishes, and I\'m sure we love each other very much,--and I\'m dying to see\r\nSylvia and tell her and--"\r\n\r\n"And what?" laughed Trent.\r\n\r\n"I am very happy," she sighed.\r\n\r\n"He\'s pure gold," returned Trent, and then gaily: "I want you and George\r\nto come and dine with us to-night. It\'s a little treat,--you see to-morrow\r\nis Sylvia\'s _fete_. She will be nineteen. I have written to Thorne, and\r\nthe Guernalecs will come with their cousin Odile. Fallowby has engaged not\r\nto bring anybody but himself."\r\n\r\nThe girl accepted shyly, charging him with loads of loving messages to\r\nSylvia, and he said good-night.\r\n\r\nHe started up the street, walking swiftly, for it was bitter cold, and\r\ncutting across the rue de la Lune he entered the rue de Seine. The early\r\nwinter night had fallen, almost without warning, but the sky was clear and\r\nmyriads of stars glittered in the heavens. The bombardment had become\r\nfurious--a steady rolling thunder from the Prussian cannon punctuated by\r\nthe heavy shocks from Mont Valerien.\r\n\r\nThe shells streamed across the sky leaving trails like shooting stars, and\r\nnow, as he turned to look back, rockets blue and red flared above the\r\nhorizon from the Fort of Issy, and the Fortress of the North flamed like a\r\nbonfire.\r\n\r\n"Good news!" a man shouted over by the Boulevard St. Germain. As if by\r\nmagic the streets were filled with people,--shivering, chattering people\r\nwith shrunken eyes.\r\n\r\n"Jacques!" cried one. "The Army of the Loire!"\r\n\r\n"Eh! _mon vieux_, it has come then at last! I told thee! I told thee!\r\nTo-morrow--to-night--who knows?"\r\n\r\n"Is it true? Is it a sortie?"\r\n\r\nSome one said: "Oh, God--a sortie--and my son?" Another cried: "To the\r\nSeine? They say one can see the signals of the Army of the Loire from the\r\nPont Neuf."\r\n\r\nThere was a child standing near Trent who kept repeating: "Mamma, Mamma,\r\nthen to-morrow we may eat white bread?" and beside him, an old man\r\nswaying, stumbling, his shrivelled hands crushed to his breast, muttering\r\nas if insane.\r\n\r\n"Could it be true? Who has heard the news? The shoemaker on the rue de\r\nBuci had it from a Mobile who had heard a Franctireur repeat it to a\r\ncaptain of the National Guard."\r\n\r\nTrent followed the throng surging through the rue de Seine to the river.\r\n\r\nRocket after rocket clove the sky, and now, from Montmartre, the cannon\r\nclanged, and the batteries on Montparnasse joined in with a crash. The\r\nbridge was packed with people.\r\n\r\nTrent asked: "Who has seen the signals of the Army of the Loire?"\r\n\r\n"We are waiting for them," was the reply.\r\n\r\nHe looked toward the north. Suddenly the huge silhouette of the Arc de\r\nTriomphe sprang into black relief against the flash of a cannon. The boom\r\nof the gun rolled along the quay and the old bridge vibrated.\r\n\r\nAgain over by the Point du Jour a flash and heavy explosion shook the\r\nbridge, and then the whole eastern bastion of the fortifications blazed\r\nand crackled, sending a red flame into the sky.\r\n\r\n"Has any one seen the signals yet?" he asked again.\r\n\r\n"We are waiting," was the reply.\r\n\r\n"Yes, waiting," murmured a man behind him, "waiting, sick, starved,\r\nfreezing, but waiting. Is it a sortie? They go gladly. Is it to starve?\r\nThey starve. They have no time to think of surrender. Are they\r\nheroes,--these Parisians? Answer me, Trent!"\r\n\r\nThe American Ambulance surgeon turned about and scanned the parapets of\r\nthe bridge.\r\n\r\n"Any news, Doctor," asked Trent mechanically.\r\n\r\n"News?" said the doctor; "I don\'t know any;--I haven\'t time to know any.\r\nWhat are these people after?"\r\n\r\n"They say that the Army of the Loire has signalled Mont Valerien."\r\n\r\n"Poor devils." The doctor glanced about him for an instant, and then: "I\'m\r\nso harried and worried that I don\'t know what to do. After the last sortie\r\nwe had the work of fifty ambulances on our poor little corps. To-morrow\r\nthere\'s another sortie, and I wish you fellows could come over to\r\nheadquarters. We may need volunteers. How is madame?" he added abruptly.\r\n\r\n"Well," replied Trent, "but she seems to grow more nervous every day. I\r\nought to be with her now."\r\n\r\n"Take care of her," said the doctor, then with a sharp look at the people:\r\n"I can\'t stop now--goodnight!" and he hurried away muttering, "Poor\r\ndevils!"\r\n\r\nTrent leaned over the parapet and blinked at the black river surging\r\nthrough the arches. Dark objects, carried swiftly on the breast of the\r\ncurrent, struck with a grinding tearing noise against the stone piers,\r\nspun around for an instant, and hurried away into the darkness. The ice\r\nfrom the Marne.\r\n\r\nAs he stood staring into the water, a hand was laid on his shoulder.\r\n"Hello, Southwark!" he cried, turning around; "this is a queer place for\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\n"Trent, I have something to tell you. Don\'t stay here,--don\'t believe in\r\nthe Army of the Loire:" and the _attache_ of the American Legation slipped\r\nhis arm through Trent\'s and drew him toward the Louvre.\r\n\r\n"Then it\'s another lie!" said Trent bitterly.\r\n\r\n"Worse--we know at the Legation--I can\'t speak of it. But that\'s not what\r\nI have to say. Something happened this afternoon. The Alsatian Brasserie\r\nwas visited and an American named Hartman has been arrested. Do you know\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\n"I know a German who calls himself an American;--his name is Hartman."\r\n\r\n"Well, he was arrested about two hours ago. They mean to shoot him."\r\n\r\n"What!"\r\n\r\n"Of course we at the Legation can\'t allow them to shoot him off-hand, but\r\nthe evidence seems conclusive."\r\n\r\n"Is he a spy?"\r\n\r\n"Well, the papers seized in his rooms are pretty damning proofs, and\r\nbesides he was caught, they say, swindling the Public Food Committee. He\r\ndrew rations for fifty, how, I don\'t know. He claims to be an American\r\nartist here, and we have been obliged to take notice of it at the\r\nLegation. It\'s a nasty affair."\r\n\r\n"To cheat the people at such a time is worse than robbing the poor-box,"\r\ncried Trent angrily. "Let them shoot him!"\r\n\r\n"He\'s an American citizen."\r\n\r\n"Yes, oh yes," said the other with bitterness. "American citizenship is a\r\nprecious privilege when every goggle-eyed German--" His anger choked him.\r\n\r\nSouthwark shook hands with him warmly. "It can\'t be helped, we must own\r\nthe carrion. I am afraid you may be called upon to identify him as an\r\nAmerican artist," he said with a ghost of a smile on his deep-lined face;\r\nand walked away through the Cours la Reine.\r\n\r\nTrent swore silently for a moment and then drew out his watch. Seven\r\no\'clock. "Sylvia will be anxious," he thought, and hurried back to the\r\nriver. The crowd still huddled shivering on the bridge, a sombre pitiful\r\ncongregation, peering out into the night for the signals of the Army of\r\nthe Loire: and their hearts beat time to the pounding of the guns, their\r\neyes lighted with each flash from the bastions, and hope rose with the\r\ndrifting rockets.\r\n\r\nA black cloud hung over the fortifications. From horizon to horizon the\r\ncannon smoke stretched in wavering bands, now capping the spires and domes\r\nwith cloud, now blowing in streamers and shreds along the streets, now\r\ndescending from the housetops, enveloping quays, bridges, and river, in a\r\nsulphurous mist. And through the smoke pall the lightning of the cannon\r\nplayed, while from time to time a rift above showed a fathomless black\r\nvault set with stars.\r\n\r\nHe turned again into the rue de Seine, that sad abandoned street, with its\r\nrows of closed shutters and desolate ranks of unlighted lamps. He was a\r\nlittle nervous and wished once or twice for a revolver, but the slinking\r\nforms which passed him in the darkness were too weak with hunger to be\r\ndangerous, he thought, and he passed on unmolested to his doorway. But\r\nthere somebody sprang at his throat. Over and over the icy pavement he\r\nrolled with his assailant, tearing at the noose about his neck, and then\r\nwith a wrench sprang to his feet.\r\n\r\n"Get up," he cried to the other.\r\n\r\nSlowly and with great deliberation, a small gamin picked himself out of\r\nthe gutter and surveyed Trent with disgust.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a nice clean trick," said Trent; "a whelp of your age! You\'ll\r\nfinish against a dead wall! Give me that cord!"\r\n\r\nThe urchin handed him the noose without a word.\r\n\r\nTrent struck a match and looked at his assailant. It was the rat-killer of\r\nthe day before.\r\n\r\n"H\'m! I thought so," he muttered.\r\n\r\n"Tiens, c\'est toi?" said the gamin tranquilly.\r\n\r\nThe impudence, the overpowering audacity of the ragamuffin took Trent\'s\r\nbreath away.\r\n\r\n"Do you know, you young strangler," he gasped, "that they shoot thieves of\r\nyour age?"\r\n\r\nThe child turned a passionless face to Trent. "Shoot, then."\r\n\r\nThat was too much, and he turned on his heel and entered his hotel.\r\n\r\nGroping up the unlighted stairway, he at last reached his own landing and\r\nfelt about in the darkness for the door. From his studio came the sound of\r\nvoices, West\'s hearty laugh and Fallowby\'s chuckle, and at last he found\r\nthe knob and, pushing back the door, stood a moment confused by the light.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Jack!" cried West, "you\'re a pleasant creature, inviting people to\r\ndine and letting them wait. Here\'s Fallowby weeping with hunger--"\r\n\r\n"Shut up," observed the latter, "perhaps he\'s been out to buy a turkey."\r\n\r\n"He\'s been out garroting, look at his noose!" laughed Guernalec.\r\n\r\n"So now we know where you get your cash!" added West; "vive le coup du\r\nPere Francois!"\r\n\r\nTrent shook hands with everybody and laughed at Sylvia\'s pale face.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean to be late; I stopped on the bridge a moment to watch the\r\nbombardment. Were you anxious, Sylvia?"\r\n\r\nShe smiled and murmured, "Oh, no!" but her hand dropped into his and\r\ntightened convulsively.\r\n\r\n"To the table!" shouted Fallowby, and uttered a joyous whoop.\r\n\r\n"Take it easy," observed Thorne, with a remnant of manners; "you are not\r\nthe host, you know."\r\n\r\nMarie Guernalec, who had been chattering with Colette, jumped up and took\r\nThorne\'s arm and Monsieur Guernalec drew Odile\'s arm through his.\r\n\r\nTrent, bowing gravely, offered his own arm to Colette, West took in\r\nSylvia, and Fallowby hovered anxiously in the rear.\r\n\r\n"You march around the table three times singing the Marseillaise,"\r\nexplained Sylvia, "and Monsieur Fallowby pounds on the table and beats\r\ntime."\r\n\r\nFallowby suggested that they could sing after dinner, but his protest was\r\ndrowned in the ringing chorus--\r\n\r\n  "Aux armes!\r\n  Formez vos bataillons!"\r\n\r\nAround the room they marched singing,\r\n\r\n  "Marchons! Marchons!"\r\n\r\nwith all their might, while Fallowby with very bad grace, hammered on the\r\ntable, consoling himself a little with the hope that the exercise would\r\nincrease his appetite. Hercules, the black and tan, fled under the bed,\r\nfrom which retreat he yapped and whined until dragged out by Guernalec and\r\nplaced in Odile\'s lap.\r\n\r\n"And now," said Trent gravely, when everybody was seated, "listen!" and he\r\nread the menu.\r\n\r\n  Beef Soup a la Siege de Paris.\r\n\r\n  Fish.\r\n  Sardines a la pere Lachaise.\r\n  (White Wine).\r\n\r\n  Roti (Red Wine).\r\n  Fresh Beef a la sortie.\r\n\r\n  Vegetables.\r\n  Canned Beans a la chasse-pot,\r\n  Canned Peas Gravelotte,\r\n  Potatoes Irlandaises,\r\n  Miscellaneous.\r\n\r\n  Cold Corned Beef a la Thieis,\r\n  Stewed Prunes a la Garibaldi.\r\n\r\n  Dessert.\r\n  Dried prunes--White bread,\r\n  Currant Jelly,\r\n  Tea--Cafe,\r\n  Liqueurs,\r\n  Pipes and Cigarettes.\r\n\r\nFallowby applauded frantically, and Sylvia served the soup.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it delicious?" sighed Odile.\r\n\r\nMarie Guernalec sipped her soup in rapture.\r\n\r\n"Not at all like horse, and I don\'t care what they say, horse doesn\'t\r\ntaste like beef," whispered Colette to West. Fallowby, who had finished,\r\nbegan to caress his chin and eye the tureen.\r\n\r\n"Have some more, old chap?" inquired Trent.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Fallowby cannot have any more," announced Sylvia; "I am saving\r\nthis for the concierge." Fallowby transferred his eyes to the fish.\r\n\r\nThe sardines, hot from the grille, were a great success. While the others\r\nwere eating Sylvia ran downstairs with the soup for the old concierge and\r\nher husband, and when she hurried back, flushed and breathless, and had\r\nslipped into her chair with a happy smile at Trent, that young man arose,\r\nand silence fell over the table. For an instant he looked at Sylvia and\r\nthought he had never seen her so beautiful.\r\n\r\n"You all know," he began, "that to-day is my wife\'s nineteenth birthday--"\r\n\r\nFallowby, bubbling with enthusiasm, waved his glass in circles about his\r\nhead to the terror of Odile and Colette, his neighbours, and Thorne, West\r\nand Guernalec refilled their glasses three times before the storm of\r\napplause which the toast of Sylvia had provoked, subsided.\r\n\r\nThree times the glasses were filled and emptied to Sylvia, and again to\r\nTrent, who protested.\r\n\r\n"This is irregular," he cried, "the next toast is to the twin Republics,\r\nFrance and America?"\r\n\r\n"To the Republics! To the Republics!" they cried, and the toast was drunk\r\namid shouts of "Vive a France! Vive l\'Amerique! Vive la Nation!"\r\n\r\nThen Trent, with a smile at West, offered the toast, "To a Happy Pair!"\r\nand everybody understood, and Sylvia leaned over and kissed Colette, while\r\nTrent bowed to West.\r\n\r\nThe beef was eaten in comparative calm, but when it was finished and a\r\nportion of it set aside for the old people below, Trent cried: "Drink to\r\nParis! May she rise from her ruins and crush the invader!" and the cheers\r\nrang out, drowning for a moment the monotonous thunder of the Prussian\r\nguns.\r\n\r\nPipes and cigarettes were lighted, and Trent listened an instant to the\r\nanimated chatter around him, broken by ripples of laughter from the girls\r\nor the mellow chuckle of Fallowby. Then he turned to West.\r\n\r\n"There is going to be a sortie to-night," he said. "I saw the American\r\nAmbulance surgeon just before I came in and he asked me to speak to you\r\nfellows. Any aid we can give him will not come amiss."\r\n\r\nThen dropping his voice and speaking in English, "As for me, I shall go\r\nout with the ambulance to-morrow morning. There is of course no danger,\r\nbut it\'s just as well to keep it from Sylvia."\r\n\r\nWest nodded. Thorne and Guernalec, who had heard, broke in and offered\r\nassistance, and Fallowby volunteered with a groan.\r\n\r\n"All right," said Trent rapidly,--"no more now, but meet me at Ambulance\r\nheadquarters to-morrow morning at eight."\r\n\r\nSylvia and Colette, who were becoming uneasy at the conversation in\r\nEnglish, now demanded to know what they were talking about.\r\n\r\n"What does a sculptor usually talk about?" cried West, with a laugh.\r\n\r\nOdile glanced reproachfully at Thorne, her _fiance_.\r\n\r\n"You are not French, you know, and it is none of your business, this war,"\r\nsaid Odile with much dignity.\r\n\r\nThorne looked meek, but West assumed an air of outraged virtue.\r\n\r\n"It seems," he said to Fallowby, "that a fellow cannot discuss the\r\nbeauties of Greek sculpture in his mother tongue, without being openly\r\nsuspected."\r\n\r\nColette placed her hand over his mouth and turning to Sylvia, murmured,\r\n"They are horridly untruthful, these men."\r\n\r\n"I believe the word for ambulance is the same in both languages," said\r\nMarie Guernalec saucily; "Sylvia, don\'t trust Monsieur Trent."\r\n\r\n"Jack," whispered Sylvia, "promise me--"\r\n\r\nA knock at the studio door interrupted her.\r\n\r\n"Come in!" cried Fallowby, but Trent sprang up, and opening the door,\r\nlooked out. Then with a hasty excuse to the rest, he stepped into the\r\nhall-way and closed the door.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned he was grumbling.\r\n\r\n"What is it, Jack?" cried West.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" repeated Trent savagely; "I\'ll tell you what it is. I have\r\nreceived a dispatch from the American Minister to go at once and identify\r\nand claim, as a fellow-countryman and a brother artist, a rascally thief\r\nand a German spy!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t go," suggested Fallowby.\r\n\r\n"If I don\'t they\'ll shoot him at once."\r\n\r\n"Let them," growled Thorne.\r\n\r\n"Do you fellows know who it is?"\r\n\r\n"Hartman!" shouted West, inspired.\r\n\r\nSylvia sprang up deathly white, but Odile slipped her arm around her and\r\nsupported her to a chair, saying calmly, "Sylvia has fainted,--it\'s the\r\nhot room,--bring some water."\r\n\r\nTrent brought it at once.\r\n\r\nSylvia opened her eyes, and after a moment rose, and supported by Marie\r\nGuernalec and Trent, passed into the bedroom.\r\n\r\nIt was the signal for breaking up, and everybody came and shook hands with\r\nTrent, saying they hoped Sylvia would sleep it off and that it would be\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nWhen Marie Guernalec took leave of him, she avoided his eyes, but he spoke\r\nto her cordially and thanked her for her aid.\r\n\r\n"Anything I can do, Jack?" inquired West, lingering, and then hurried\r\ndownstairs to catch up with the rest.\r\n\r\nTrent leaned over the banisters, listening to their footsteps and chatter,\r\nand then the lower door banged and the house was silent. He lingered,\r\nstaring down into the blackness, biting his lips; then with an impatient\r\nmovement, "I am crazy!" he muttered, and lighting a candle, went into the\r\nbedroom. Sylvia was lying on the bed. He bent over her, smoothing the\r\ncurly hair on her forehead.\r\n\r\n"Are you better, dear Sylvia?"\r\n\r\nShe did not answer, but raised her eyes to his. For an instant he met her\r\ngaze, but what he read there sent a chill to his heart and he sat down\r\ncovering his face with his hands.\r\n\r\nAt last she spoke in a voice, changed and strained,--a voice which he had\r\nnever heard, and he dropped his hands and listened, bolt upright in his\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n"Jack, it has come at last. I have feared it and trembled,--ah! how often\r\nhave I lain awake at night with this on my heart and prayed that I might\r\ndie before you should ever know of it! For I love you, Jack, and if you go\r\naway I cannot live. I have deceived you;--it happened before I knew you,\r\nbut since that first day when you found me weeping in the Luxembourg and\r\nspoke to me, Jack, I have been faithful to you in every thought and deed.\r\nI loved you from the first, and did not dare to tell you this--fearing\r\nthat you would go away; and since then my love has grown--grown--and oh! I\r\nsuffered!--but I dared not tell you. And now you know, but you do not know\r\nthe worst. For him--now--what do I care? He was cruel--oh, so cruel!"\r\n\r\nShe hid her face in her arms.\r\n\r\n"Must I go on? Must I tell you--can you not imagine, oh! Jack--"\r\n\r\nHe did not stir; his eyes seemed dead.\r\n\r\n"I--I was so young, I knew nothing, and he said--said that he loved me--"\r\n\r\nTrent rose and struck the candle with his clenched fist, and the room was\r\ndark.\r\n\r\nThe bells of St. Sulpice tolled the hour, and she started up, speaking\r\nwith feverish haste,--"I must finish! When you told me you loved\r\nme--you--you asked me nothing; but then, even then, it was too late, and\r\n_that other life_ which binds me to him, must stand for ever between you\r\nand me! For there _is another_ whom he has claimed, and is good to. He\r\nmust not die,--they cannot shoot him, for that _other\'s_ sake!"\r\n\r\nTrent sat motionless, but his thoughts ran on in an interminable whirl.\r\n\r\nSylvia, little Sylvia, who shared with him his student life,--who bore\r\nwith him the dreary desolation of the siege without complaint,--this\r\nslender blue-eyed girl whom he was so quietly fond of, whom he teased or\r\ncaressed as the whim suited, who sometimes made him the least bit\r\nimpatient with her passionate devotion to him,--could this be the same\r\nSylvia who lay weeping there in the darkness?\r\n\r\nThen he clinched his teeth. "Let him die! Let him die!"--but then,--for\r\nSylvia\'s sake, and,--for that _other\'s_ sake,--Yes, he would go,--he\r\n_must_ go,--his duty was plain before him. But Sylvia,--he could not be\r\nwhat he had been to her, and yet a vague terror seized him, now all was\r\nsaid. Trembling, he struck a light.\r\n\r\nShe lay there, her curly hair tumbled about her face, her small white\r\nhands pressed to her breast.\r\n\r\nHe could not leave her, and he could not stay. He never knew before that\r\nhe loved her. She had been a mere comrade, this girl wife of his. Ah! he\r\nloved her now with all his heart and soul, and he knew it, only when it\r\nwas too late. Too late? Why? Then he thought of that _other_ one, binding\r\nher, linking her forever to the creature, who stood in danger of his life.\r\nWith an oath he sprang to the door, but the door would not open,--or was\r\nit that he pressed it back,--locked it,--and flung himself on his knees\r\nbeside the bed, knowing that he dared not for his life\'s sake leave what\r\nwas his all in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIt was four in the morning when he came out of the Prison of the Condemned\r\nwith the Secretary of the American Legation. A knot of people had gathered\r\naround the American Minister\'s carriage, which stood in front of the\r\nprison, the horses stamping and pawing in the icy street, the coachman\r\nhuddled on the box, wrapped in furs. Southwark helped the Secretary into\r\nthe carriage, and shook hands with Trent, thanking him for coming.\r\n\r\n"How the scoundrel did stare," he said; "your evidence was worse than a\r\nkick, but it saved his skin for the moment at least,--and prevented\r\ncomplications."\r\n\r\nThe Secretary sighed. "We have done our part. Now let them prove him a spy\r\nand we wash our hands of him. Jump in, Captain! Come along, Trent!"\r\n\r\n"I have a word to say to Captain Southwark, I won\'t detain him," said\r\nTrent hastily, and dropping his voice, "Southwark, help _me_ now. You know\r\nthe story from the blackguard. You know the--the child is at his rooms.\r\nGet it, and take it to my own apartment, and if he is shot, I will provide\r\na home for it."\r\n\r\n"I understand," said the Captain gravely.\r\n\r\n"Will you do this at once?"\r\n\r\n"At once," he replied.\r\n\r\nTheir hands met in a warm clasp, and then Captain Southwark climbed into\r\nthe carriage, motioning Trent to follow; but he shook his head saying,\r\n"Good-bye!" and the carriage rolled away.\r\n\r\nHe watched the carriage to the end of the street, then started toward his\r\nown quarter, but after a step or two hesitated, stopped, and finally\r\nturned away in the opposite direction. Something--perhaps it was the sight\r\nof the prisoner he had so recently confronted nauseated him. He felt the\r\nneed of solitude and quiet to collect his thoughts. The events of the\r\nevening had shaken him terribly, but he would walk it off, forget, bury\r\neverything, and then go back to Sylvia. He started on swiftly, and for a\r\ntime the bitter thoughts seemed to fade, but when he paused at last,\r\nbreathless, under the Arc de Triomphe, the bitterness and the wretchedness\r\nof the whole thing--yes, of his whole misspent life came back with a pang.\r\nThen the face of the prisoner, stamped with the horrible grimace of fear,\r\ngrew in the shadows before his eyes.\r\n\r\nSick at heart he wandered up and down under the great Arc, striving to\r\noccupy his mind, peering up at the sculptured cornices to read the names\r\nof the heroes and battles which he knew were engraved there, but always\r\nthe ashen face of Hartman followed him, grinning with terror!--or was it\r\nterror?--was it not triumph?--At the thought he leaped like a man who\r\nfeels a knife at his throat, but after a savage tramp around the square,\r\ncame back again and sat down to battle with his misery.\r\n\r\nThe air was cold, but his cheeks were burning with angry shame. Shame?\r\nWhy? Was it because he had married a girl whom chance had made a mother?\r\n_Did_ he love her? Was this miserable bohemian existence, then, his end\r\nand aim in life? He turned his eyes upon the secrets of his heart, and\r\nread an evil story,--the story of the past, and he covered his face for\r\nshame, while, keeping time to the dull pain throbbing in his head, his\r\nheart beat out the story for the future. Shame and disgrace.\r\n\r\nRoused at last from a lethargy which had begun to numb the bitterness of\r\nhis thoughts, he raised his head and looked about. A sudden fog had\r\nsettled in the streets; the arches of the Arc were choked with it. He\r\nwould go home. A great horror of being alone seized him. _But he was not\r\nalone._ The fog was peopled with phantoms. All around him in the mist they\r\nmoved, drifting through the arches in lengthening lines, and vanished,\r\nwhile from the fog others rose up, swept past and were engulfed. He was\r\nnot alone, for even at his side they crowded, touched him, swarmed before\r\nhim, beside him, behind him, pressed him back, seized, and bore him with\r\nthem through the mist. Down a dim avenue, through lanes and alleys white\r\nwith fog, they moved, and if they spoke their voices were dull as the\r\nvapour which shrouded them. At last in front, a bank of masonry and earth\r\ncut by a massive iron barred gate towered up in the fog. Slowly and more\r\nslowly they glided, shoulder to shoulder and thigh to thigh. Then all\r\nmovement ceased. A sudden breeze stirred the fog. It wavered and eddied.\r\nObjects became more distinct. A pallor crept above the horizon, touching\r\nthe edges of the watery clouds, and drew dull sparks from a thousand\r\nbayonets. Bayonets--they were everywhere, cleaving the fog or flowing\r\nbeneath it in rivers of steel. High on the wall of masonry and earth a\r\ngreat gun loomed, and around it figures moved in silhouettes. Below, a\r\nbroad torrent of bayonets swept through the iron barred gateway, out into\r\nthe shadowy plain. It became lighter. Faces grew more distinct among the\r\nmarching masses and he recognized one.\r\n\r\n"You, Philippe!"\r\n\r\nThe figure turned its head.\r\n\r\nTrent cried, "Is there room for me?" but the other only waved his arm in a\r\nvague adieu and was gone with the rest. Presently the cavalry began to\r\npass, squadron on squadron, crowding out into the darkness; then many\r\ncannon, then an ambulance, then again the endless lines of bayonets.\r\nBeside him a cuirassier sat on his steaming horse, and in front, among a\r\ngroup of mounted officers he saw a general, with the astrakan collar of\r\nhis dolman turned up about his bloodless face.\r\n\r\nSome women were weeping near him and one was struggling to force a loaf of\r\nblack bread into a soldier\'s haversack. The soldier tried to aid her, but\r\nthe sack was fastened, and his rifle bothered him, so Trent held it, while\r\nthe woman unbuttoned the sack and forced in the bread, now all wet with\r\nher tears. The rifle was not heavy. Trent found it wonderfully manageable.\r\nWas the bayonet sharp? He tried it. Then a sudden longing, a fierce,\r\nimperative desire took possession of him.\r\n\r\n"_Chouette!_" cried a gamin, clinging to the barred gate, "_encore toi mon\r\nvieux_?"\r\n\r\nTrent looked up, and the rat-killer laughed in his face. But when the\r\nsoldier had taken the rifle again, and thanking him, ran hard to catch his\r\nbattalion, he plunged into the throng about the gateway.\r\n\r\n"Are you going?" he cried to a marine who sat in the gutter bandaging his\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nThen a girl--a mere child--caught him by the hand and led him into the\r\ncafe which faced the gate. The room was crowded with soldiers, some, white\r\nand silent, sitting on the floor, others groaning on the leather-covered\r\nsettees. The air was sour and suffocating.\r\n\r\n"Choose!" said the girl with a little gesture of pity; "they can\'t go!"\r\n\r\nIn a heap of clothing on the floor he found a capote and kepi.\r\n\r\nShe helped him buckle his knapsack, cartridge-box, and belt, and showed\r\nhim how to load the chasse-pot rifle, holding it on her knees.\r\n\r\nWhen he thanked her she started to her feet.\r\n\r\n"You are a foreigner!"\r\n\r\n"American," he said, moving toward the door, but the child barred his way.\r\n\r\n"I am a Bretonne. My father is up there with the cannon of the marine. He\r\nwill shoot you if you are a spy."\r\n\r\nThey faced each other for a moment. Then sighing, he bent over and kissed\r\nthe child. "Pray for France, little one," he murmured, and she repeated\r\nwith a pale smile: "For France and you, beau Monsieur."\r\n\r\nHe ran across the street and through the gateway. Once outside, he edged\r\ninto line and shouldered his way along the road. A corporal passed, looked\r\nat him, repassed, and finally called an officer. "You belong to the 60th,"\r\ngrowled the corporal looking at the number on his kepi.\r\n\r\n"We have no use for Franc-tireurs," added the officer, catching sight of\r\nhis black trousers.\r\n\r\n"I wish to volunteer in place of a comrade," said Trent, and the officer\r\nshrugged his shoulders and passed on.\r\n\r\nNobody paid much attention to him, one or two merely glancing at his\r\ntrousers. The road was deep with slush and mud-ploughed and torn by wheels\r\nand hoofs. A soldier in front of him wrenched his foot in an icy rut and\r\ndragged himself to the edge of the embankment groaning. The plain on\r\neither side of them was grey with melting snow. Here and there behind\r\ndismantled hedge-rows stood wagons, bearing white flags with red crosses.\r\nSometimes the driver was a priest in rusty hat and gown, sometimes a\r\ncrippled Mobile. Once they passed a wagon driven by a Sister of Charity.\r\nSilent empty houses with great rents in their walls, and every window\r\nblank, huddled along the road. Further on, within the zone of danger,\r\nnothing of human habitation remained except here and there a pile of\r\nfrozen bricks or a blackened cellar choked with snow.\r\n\r\nFor some time Trent had been annoyed by the man behind him, who kept\r\ntreading on his heels. Convinced at last that it was intentional, he\r\nturned to remonstrate and found himself face to face with a fellow-student\r\nfrom the Beaux Arts. Trent stared.\r\n\r\n"I thought you were in the hospital!"\r\n\r\nThe other shook his head, pointing to his bandaged jaw.\r\n\r\n"I see, you can\'t speak. Can I do anything?"\r\n\r\nThe wounded man rummaged in his haversack and produced a crust of black\r\nbread.\r\n\r\n"He can\'t eat it, his jaw is smashed, and he wants you to chew it for\r\nhim," said the soldier next to him.\r\n\r\nTrent took the crust, and grinding it in his teeth morsel by morsel,\r\npassed it back to the starving man.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time mounted orderlies sped to the front, covering them with\r\nslush. It was a chilly, silent march through sodden meadows wreathed in\r\nfog. Along the railroad embankment across the ditch, another column moved\r\nparallel to their own. Trent watched it, a sombre mass, now distinct, now\r\nvague, now blotted out in a puff of fog. Once for half-an-hour he lost it,\r\nbut when again it came into view, he noticed a thin line detach itself\r\nfrom the flank, and, bellying in the middle, swing rapidly to the west. At\r\nthe same moment a prolonged crackling broke out in the fog in front. Other\r\nlines began to slough off from the column, swinging east and west, and the\r\ncrackling became continuous. A battery passed at full gallop, and he drew\r\nback with his comrades to give it way. It went into action a little to the\r\nright of his battalion, and as the shot from the first rifled piece boomed\r\nthrough the mist, the cannon from the fortifications opened with a mighty\r\nroar. An officer galloped by shouting something which Trent did not catch,\r\nbut he saw the ranks in front suddenly part company with his own, and\r\ndisappear in the twilight. More officers rode up and stood beside him\r\npeering into the fog. Away in front the crackling had become one prolonged\r\ncrash. It was dreary waiting. Trent chewed some bread for the man behind,\r\nwho tried to swallow it, and after a while shook his head, motioning Trent\r\nto eat the rest himself. A corporal offered him a little brandy and he\r\ndrank it, but when he turned around to return the flask, the corporal was\r\nlying on the ground. Alarmed, he looked at the soldier next to him, who\r\nshrugged his shoulders and opened his mouth to speak, but something struck\r\nhim and he rolled over and over into the ditch below. At that moment the\r\nhorse of one of the officers gave a bound and backed into the battalion,\r\nlashing out with his heels. One man was ridden down; another was kicked in\r\nthe chest and hurled through the ranks. The officer sank his spurs into\r\nthe horse and forced him to the front again, where he stood trembling. The\r\ncannonade seemed to draw nearer. A staff-officer, riding slowly up and\r\ndown the battalion suddenly collapsed in his saddle and clung to his\r\nhorse\'s mane. One of his boots dangled, crimsoned and dripping, from the\r\nstirrup. Then out of the mist in front men came running. The roads, the\r\nfields, the ditches were full of them, and many of them fell. For an\r\ninstant he imagined he saw horsemen riding about like ghosts in the\r\nvapours beyond, and a man behind him cursed horribly, declaring he too had\r\nseen them, and that they were Uhlans; but the battalion stood inactive,\r\nand the mist fell again over the meadows.\r\n\r\nThe colonel sat heavily upon his horse, his bullet-shaped head buried in\r\nthe astrakan collar of his dolman, his fat legs sticking straight out in\r\nthe stirrups.\r\n\r\nThe buglers clustered about him with bugles poised, and behind him a\r\nstaff-officer in a pale blue jacket smoked a cigarette and chatted with a\r\ncaptain of hussars. From the road in front came the sound of furious\r\ngalloping and an orderly reined up beside the colonel, who motioned him to\r\nthe rear without turning his head. Then on the left a confused murmur\r\narose which ended in a shout. A hussar passed like the wind, followed by\r\nanother and another, and then squadron after squadron whirled by them into\r\nthe sheeted mists. At that instant the colonel reared in his saddle, the\r\nbugles clanged, and the whole battalion scrambled down the embankment,\r\nover the ditch and started across the soggy meadow. Almost at once Trent\r\nlost his cap. Something snatched it from his head, he thought it was a\r\ntree branch. A good many of his comrades rolled over in the slush and ice,\r\nand he imagined that they had slipped. One pitched right across his path\r\nand he stopped to help him up, but the man screamed when he touched him\r\nand an officer shouted, "Forward! Forward!" so he ran on again. It was a\r\nlong jog through the mist, and he was often obliged to shift his rifle.\r\nWhen at last they lay panting behind the railroad embankment, he looked\r\nabout him. He had felt the need of action, of a desperate physical\r\nstruggle, of killing and crushing. He had been seized with a desire to\r\nfling himself among masses and tear right and left. He longed to fire, to\r\nuse the thin sharp bayonet on his chassepot. He had not expected this. He\r\nwished to become exhausted, to struggle and cut until incapable of lifting\r\nhis arm. Then he had intended to go home. He heard a man say that half the\r\nbattalion had gone down in the charge, and he saw another examining a\r\ncorpse under the embankment. The body, still warm, was clothed in a\r\nstrange uniform, but even when he noticed the spiked helmet lying a few\r\ninches further away, he did not realize what had happened.\r\n\r\nThe colonel sat on his horse a few feet to the left, his eyes sparkling\r\nunder the crimson kepi. Trent heard him reply to an officer: "I can hold\r\nit, but another charge, and I won\'t have enough men left to sound a\r\nbugle."\r\n\r\n"Were the Prussians here?" Trent asked of a soldier who sat wiping the\r\nblood trickling from his hair.\r\n\r\n"Yes. The hussars cleaned them out. We caught their cross fire."\r\n\r\n"We are supporting a battery on the embankment," said another.\r\n\r\nThen the battalion crawled over the embankment and moved along the lines\r\nof twisted rails. Trent rolled up his trousers and tucked them into his\r\nwoollen socks: but they halted again, and some of the men sat down on the\r\ndismantled railroad track. Trent looked for his wounded comrade from the\r\nBeaux Arts. He was standing in his place, very pale. The cannonade had\r\nbecome terrific. For a moment the mist lifted. He caught a glimpse of the\r\nfirst battalion motionless on the railroad track in front, of regiments on\r\neither flank, and then, as the fog settled again, the drums beat and the\r\nmusic of the bugles began away on the extreme left. A restless movement\r\npassed among the troops, the colonel threw up his arm, the drums rolled,\r\nand the battalion moved off through the fog. They were near the front now\r\nfor the battalion was firing as it advanced. Ambulances galloped along the\r\nbase of the embankment to the rear, and the hussars passed and repassed\r\nlike phantoms. They were in the front at last, for all about them was\r\nmovement and turmoil, while from the fog, close at hand, came cries and\r\ngroans and crashing volleys. Shells fell everywhere, bursting along the\r\nembankment, splashing them with frozen slush. Trent was frightened. He\r\nbegan to dread the unknown, which lay there crackling and flaming in\r\nobscurity. The shock of the cannon sickened him. He could even see the fog\r\nlight up with a dull orange as the thunder shook the earth. It was near,\r\nhe felt certain, for the colonel shouted "Forward!" and the first\r\nbattalion was hastening into it. He felt its breath, he trembled, but\r\nhurried on. A fearful discharge in front terrified him. Somewhere in the\r\nfog men were cheering, and the colonel\'s horse, streaming with blood\r\nplunged about in the smoke.\r\n\r\nAnother blast and shock, right in his face, almost stunned him, and he\r\nfaltered. All the men to the right were down. His head swam; the fog and\r\nsmoke stupefied him. He put out his hand for a support and caught\r\nsomething. It was the wheel of a gun-carriage, and a man sprang from\r\nbehind it, aiming a blow at his head with a rammer, but stumbled back\r\nshrieking with a bayonet through his neck, and Trent knew that he had\r\nkilled. Mechanically he stooped to pick up his rifle, but the bayonet was\r\nstill in the man, who lay, beating with red hands against the sod. It\r\nsickened him and he leaned on the cannon. Men were fighting all around him\r\nnow, and the air was foul with smoke and sweat. Somebody seized him from\r\nbehind and another in front, but others in turn seized them or struck them\r\nsolid blows. The click! click! click! of bayonets infuriated him, and he\r\ngrasped the rammer and struck out blindly until it was shivered to pieces.\r\n\r\nA man threw his arm around his neck and bore him to the ground, but he\r\nthrottled him and raised himself on his knees. He saw a comrade seize the\r\ncannon, and fall across it with his skull crushed in; he saw the colonel\r\ntumble clean out of his saddle into the mud; then consciousness fled.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to himself, he was lying on the embankment among the twisted\r\nrails. On every side huddled men who cried out and cursed and fled away\r\ninto the fog, and he staggered to his feet and followed them. Once he\r\nstopped to help a comrade with a bandaged jaw, who could not speak but\r\nclung to his arm for a time and then fell dead in the freezing mire; and\r\nagain he aided another, who groaned: "Trent, c\'est moi--Philippe," until a\r\nsudden volley in the midst relieved him of his charge.\r\n\r\nAn icy wind swept down from the heights, cutting the fog into shreds. For\r\nan instant, with an evil leer the sun peered through the naked woods of\r\nVincennes, sank like a blood-clot in the battery smoke, lower, lower, into\r\nthe blood-soaked plain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nWhen midnight sounded from the belfry of St. Sulpice the gates of Paris\r\nwere still choked with fragments of what had once been an army.\r\n\r\nThey entered with the night, a sullen horde, spattered with slime, faint\r\nwith hunger and exhaustion. There was little disorder at first, and the\r\nthrong at the gates parted silently as the troops tramped along the\r\nfreezing streets. Confusion came as the hours passed. Swiftly and more\r\nswiftly, crowding squadron after squadron and battery on battery, horses\r\nplunging and caissons jolting, the remnants from the front surged through\r\nthe gates, a chaos of cavalry and artillery struggling for the right of\r\nway. Close upon them stumbled the infantry; here a skeleton of a regiment\r\nmarching with a desperate attempt at order, there a riotous mob of Mobiles\r\ncrushing their way to the streets, then a turmoil of horsemen, cannon,\r\ntroops without, officers, officers without men, then again a line of\r\nambulances, the wheels groaning under their heavy loads.\r\n\r\nDumb with misery the crowd looked on.\r\n\r\nAll through the day the ambulances had been arriving, and all day long the\r\nragged throng whimpered and shivered by the barriers. At noon the crowd\r\nwas increased ten-fold, filling the squares about the gates, and swarming\r\nover the inner fortifications.\r\n\r\nAt four o\'clock in the afternoon the German batteries suddenly wreathed\r\nthemselves in smoke, and the shells fell fast on Montparnasse. At twenty\r\nminutes after four two projectiles struck a house in the rue de Bac, and a\r\nmoment later the first shell fell in the Latin Quarter.\r\n\r\nBraith was painting in bed when West came in very much scared.\r\n\r\n"I wish you would come down; our house has been knocked into a cocked hat,\r\nand I\'m afraid that some of the pillagers may take it into their heads to\r\npay us a visit to-night."\r\n\r\nBraith jumped out of bed and bundled himself into a garment which had once\r\nbeen an overcoat.\r\n\r\n"Anybody hurt?" he inquired, struggling with a sleeve full of dilapidated\r\nlining.\r\n\r\n"No. Colette is barricaded in the cellar, and the concierge ran away to\r\nthe fortifications. There will be a rough gang there if the bombardment\r\nkeeps up. You might help us--"\r\n\r\n"Of course," said Braith; but it was not until they had reached the rue\r\nSerpente and had turned in the passage which led to West\'s cellar, that\r\nthe latter cried: "Have you seen Jack Trent, to-day?"\r\n\r\n"No," replied Braith, looking troubled, "he was not at Ambulance\r\nHeadquarters."\r\n\r\n"He stayed to take care of Sylvia, I suppose."\r\n\r\nA bomb came crashing through the roof of a house at the end of the alley\r\nand burst in the basement, showering the street with slate and plaster. A\r\nsecond struck a chimney and plunged into the garden, followed by an\r\navalanche of bricks, and another exploded with a deafening report in the\r\nnext street.\r\n\r\nThey hurried along the passage to the steps which led to the cellar. Here\r\nagain Braith stopped.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think I had better run up to see if Jack and Sylvia are well\r\nentrenched? I can get back before dark."\r\n\r\n"No. Go in and find Colette, and I\'ll go."\r\n\r\n"No, no, let me go, there\'s no danger."\r\n\r\n"I know it," replied West calmly; and, dragging Braith into the alley,\r\npointed to the cellar steps. The iron door was barred.\r\n\r\n"Colette! Colette!" he called. The door swung inward, and the girl sprang\r\nup the stairs to meet them. At that instant, Braith, glancing behind him,\r\ngave a startled cry, and pushing the two before him into the cellar,\r\njumped down after them and slammed the iron door. A few seconds later a\r\nheavy jar from the outside shook the hinges.\r\n\r\n"They are here," muttered West, very pale.\r\n\r\n"That door," observed Colette calmly, "will hold for ever."\r\n\r\nBraith examined the low iron structure, now trembling with the blows\r\nrained on it from without. West glanced anxiously at Colette, who\r\ndisplayed no agitation, and this comforted him.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe they will spend much time here," said Braith; "they only\r\nrummage in cellars for spirits, I imagine."\r\n\r\n"Unless they hear that valuables are buried there."\r\n\r\n"But surely nothing is buried here?" exclaimed Braith uneasily.\r\n\r\n"Unfortunately there is," growled West. "That miserly landlord of mine--"\r\n\r\nA crash from the outside, followed by a yell, cut him short; then blow\r\nafter blow shook the doors, until there came a sharp snap, a clinking of\r\nmetal and a triangular bit of iron fell inwards, leaving a hole through\r\nwhich struggled a ray of light.\r\n\r\nInstantly West knelt, and shoving his revolver through the aperture fired\r\nevery cartridge. For a moment the alley resounded with the racket of the\r\nrevolver, then absolute silence followed.\r\n\r\nPresently a single questioning blow fell upon the door, and a moment later\r\nanother and another, and then a sudden crack zigzagged across the iron\r\nplate.\r\n\r\n"Here," said West, seizing Colette by the wrist, "you follow me, Braith!"\r\nand he ran swiftly toward a circular spot of light at the further end of\r\nthe cellar. The spot of light came from a barred man-hole above. West\r\nmotioned Braith to mount on his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Push it over. You _must_!"\r\n\r\nWith little effort Braith lifted the barred cover, scrambled out on his\r\nstomach, and easily raised Colette from West\'s shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Quick, old chap!" cried the latter.\r\n\r\nBraith twisted his legs around a fence-chain and leaned down again. The\r\ncellar was flooded with a yellow light, and the air reeked with the stench\r\nof petroleum torches. The iron door still held, but a whole plate of metal\r\nwas gone, and now as they looked a figure came creeping through, holding a\r\ntorch.\r\n\r\n"Quick!" whispered Braith. "Jump!" and West hung dangling until Colette\r\ngrasped him by the collar, and he was dragged out. Then her nerves gave\r\nway and she wept hysterically, but West threw his arm around her and led\r\nher across the gardens into the next street, where Braith, after replacing\r\nthe man-hole cover and piling some stone slabs from the wall over it,\r\nrejoined them. It was almost dark. They hurried through the street, now\r\nonly lighted by burning buildings, or the swift glare of the shells. They\r\ngave wide berth to the fires, but at a distance saw the flitting forms of\r\npillagers among the _debris_. Sometimes they passed a female fury crazed\r\nwith drink shrieking anathemas upon the world, or some slouching lout\r\nwhose blackened face and hands betrayed his share in the work of\r\ndestruction. At last they reached the Seine and passed the bridge, and\r\nthen Braith said: "I must go back. I am not sure of Jack and Sylvia." As\r\nhe spoke, he made way for a crowd which came trampling across the bridge,\r\nand along the river wall by the d\'Orsay barracks. In the midst of it West\r\ncaught the measured tread of a platoon. A lantern passed, a file of\r\nbayonets, then another lantern which glimmered on a deathly face behind,\r\nand Colette gasped, "Hartman!" and he was gone. They peered fearfully\r\nacross the embankment, holding their breath. There was a shuffle of feet\r\non the quay, and the gate of the barracks slammed. A lantern shone for a\r\nmoment at the postern, the crowd pressed to the grille, then came the\r\nclang of the volley from the stone parade.\r\n\r\nOne by one the petroleum torches flared up along the embankment, and now\r\nthe whole square was in motion. Down from the Champs Elysees and across\r\nthe Place de la Concorde straggled the fragments of the battle, a company\r\nhere, and a mob there. They poured in from every street followed by women\r\nand children, and a great murmur, borne on the icy wind, swept through the\r\nArc de Triomphe and down the dark avenue,--"Perdus! perdus!"\r\n\r\nA ragged end of a battalion was pressing past, the spectre of\r\nannihilation. West groaned. Then a figure sprang from the shadowy ranks\r\nand called West\'s name, and when he saw it was Trent he cried out. Trent\r\nseized him, white with terror.\r\n\r\n"Sylvia?"\r\n\r\nWest stared speechless, but Colette moaned, "Oh, Sylvia! Sylvia!--and they\r\nare shelling the Quarter!"\r\n\r\n"Trent!" shouted Braith; but he was gone, and they could not overtake\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe bombardment ceased as Trent crossed the Boulevard St. Germain, but the\r\nentrance to the rue de Seine was blocked by a heap of smoking bricks.\r\nEverywhere the shells had torn great holes in the pavement. The cafe was a\r\nwreck of splinters and glass, the book-store tottered, ripped from roof to\r\nbasement, and the little bakery, long since closed, bulged outward above a\r\nmass of slate and tin.\r\n\r\nHe climbed over the steaming bricks and hurried into the rue de Tournon.\r\nOn the corner a fire blazed, lighting up his own street, and on the bank\r\nwall, beneath a shattered gas lamp, a child was writing with a bit of\r\ncinder.\r\n\r\n"HERE FELL THE FIRST SHELL."\r\n\r\nThe letters stared him in the face. The rat-killer finished and stepped\r\nback to view his work, but catching sight of Trent\'s bayonet, screamed and\r\nfled, and as Trent staggered across the shattered street, from holes and\r\ncrannies in the ruins fierce women fled from their work of pillage,\r\ncursing him.\r\n\r\nAt first he could not find his house, for the tears blinded him, but he\r\nfelt along the wall and reached the door. A lantern burned in the\r\nconcierge\'s lodge and the old man lay dead beside it. Faint with fright he\r\nleaned a moment on his rifle, then, snatching the lantern, sprang up the\r\nstairs. He tried to call, but his tongue hardly moved. On the second floor\r\nhe saw plaster on the stairway, and on the third the floor was torn and\r\nthe concierge lay in a pool of blood across the landing. The next floor\r\nwas his, _theirs_. The door hung from its hinges, the walls gaped. He\r\ncrept in and sank down by the bed, and there two arms were flung around\r\nhis neck, and a tear-stained face sought his own.\r\n\r\n"Sylvia!"\r\n\r\n"O Jack! Jack! Jack!"\r\n\r\nFrom the tumbled pillow beside them a child wailed.\r\n\r\n"They brought it; it is mine," she sobbed.\r\n\r\n"Ours," he whispered, with his arms around them both.\r\n\r\nThen from the stairs below came Braith\'s anxious voice.\r\n\r\n"Trent! Is all well?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STREET OF OUR LADY OF THE FIELDS\r\n\r\n  "Et tout les jours passes dans la tristesse\r\n  Nous sont comptes comme des jours heureux!"\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe street is not fashionable, neither is it shabby. It is a pariah among\r\nstreets--a street without a Quarter. It is generally understood to lie\r\noutside the pale of the aristocratic Avenue de l\'Observatoire. The\r\nstudents of the Montparnasse Quarter consider it swell and will have none\r\nof it. The Latin Quarter, from the Luxembourg, its northern frontier,\r\nsneers at its respectability and regards with disfavour the correctly\r\ncostumed students who haunt it. Few strangers go into it. At times,\r\nhowever, the Latin Quarter students use it as a thoroughfare between the\r\nrue de Rennes and the Bullier, but except for that and the weekly\r\nafternoon visits of parents and guardians to the Convent near the rue\r\nVavin, the street of Our Lady of the Fields is as quiet as a Passy\r\nboulevard. Perhaps the most respectable portion lies between the rue de la\r\nGrande Chaumiere and the rue Vavin, at least this was the conclusion\r\narrived at by the Reverend Joel Byram, as he rambled through it with\r\nHastings in charge. To Hastings the street looked pleasant in the bright\r\nJune weather, and he had begun to hope for its selection when the Reverend\r\nByram shied violently at the cross on the Convent opposite.\r\n\r\n"Jesuits," he muttered.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Hastings wearily, "I imagine we won\'t find anything better.\r\nYou say yourself that vice is triumphant in Paris, and it seems to me that\r\nin every street we find Jesuits or something worse."\r\n\r\nAfter a moment he repeated, "Or something worse, which of course I would\r\nnot notice except for your kindness in warning me."\r\n\r\nDr. Byram sucked in his lips and looked about him. He was impressed by the\r\nevident respectability of the surroundings. Then frowning at the Convent\r\nhe took Hastings\' arm and shuffled across the street to an iron gateway\r\nwhich bore the number 201 _bis_ painted in white on a blue ground. Below\r\nthis was a notice printed in English:\r\n\r\n  1. For Porter please oppress once.\r\n  2. For Servant please oppress twice.\r\n  3. For Parlour please oppress thrice.\r\n\r\nHastings touched the electric button three times, and they were ushered\r\nthrough the garden and into the parlour by a trim maid. The dining-room\r\ndoor, just beyond, was open, and from the table in plain view a stout\r\nwoman hastily arose and came toward them. Hastings caught a glimpse of a\r\nyoung man with a big head and several snuffy old gentlemen at breakfast,\r\nbefore the door closed and the stout woman waddled into the room, bringing\r\nwith her an aroma of coffee and a black poodle."\r\n\r\n"It ees a plaisir to you receive!" she cried. "Monsieur is Anglish? No?\r\nAmericain? Off course. My pension it ees for Americains surtout. Here all\r\nspik Angleesh, c\'est a dire, ze personnel; ze sairvants do spik, plus ou\r\nmoins, a little. I am happy to have you comme pensionnaires--"\r\n\r\n"Madame," began Dr. Byram, but was cut short again.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yess, I know, ah! mon Dieu! you do not spik Frainch but you have come\r\nto lairne! My husband does spik Frainch wiss ze pensionnaires. We have at\r\nze moment a family Americaine who learn of my husband Frainch--"\r\n\r\nHere the poodle growled at Dr. Byram and was promptly cuffed by his\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\n"Veux tu!" she cried, with a slap, "veux tu! Oh! le vilain, oh! le\r\nvilain!"\r\n\r\n"Mais, madame," said Hastings, smiling, "il n\'a pas l\'air tres feroce."\r\n\r\nThe poodle fled, and his mistress cried, "Ah, ze accent charming! He does\r\nspik already Frainch like a Parisien young gentleman!"\r\n\r\nThen Dr. Byram managed to get in a word or two and gathered more or less\r\ninformation with regard to prices.\r\n\r\n"It ees a pension serieux; my clientele ees of ze best, indeed a pension\r\nde famille where one ees at \'ome."\r\n\r\nThen they went upstairs to examine Hastings\' future quarters, test the\r\nbed-springs and arrange for the weekly towel allowance. Dr. Byram appeared\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nMadame Marotte accompanied them to the door and rang for the maid, but as\r\nHastings stepped out into the gravel walk, his guide and mentor paused a\r\nmoment and fixed Madame with his watery eyes.\r\n\r\n"You understand," he said, "that he is a youth of most careful bringing\r\nup, and his character and morals are without a stain. He is young and has\r\nnever been abroad, never even seen a large city, and his parents have\r\nrequested me, as an old family friend living in Paris, to see that he is\r\nplaced under good influences. He is to study art, but on no account would\r\nhis parents wish him to live in the Latin Quarter if they knew of the\r\nimmorality which is rife there."\r\n\r\nA sound like the click of a latch interrupted him and he raised his eyes,\r\nbut not in time to see the maid slap the big-headed young man behind the\r\nparlour-door.\r\n\r\nMadame coughed, cast a deadly glance behind her and then beamed on Dr.\r\nByram.\r\n\r\n"It ees well zat he come here. The pension more serious, il n\'en existe\r\npas, eet ees not any!" she announced with conviction.\r\n\r\nSo, as there was nothing more to add, Dr. Byram joined Hastings at the\r\ngate.\r\n\r\n"I trust," he said, eyeing the Convent, "that you will make no\r\nacquaintances among Jesuits!"\r\n\r\nHastings looked at the Convent until a pretty girl passed before the gray\r\nfacade, and then he looked at her. A young fellow with a paint-box and\r\ncanvas came swinging along, stopped before the pretty girl, said something\r\nduring a brief but vigorous handshake at which they both laughed, and he\r\nwent his way, calling back, "A demain Valentine!" as in the same breath\r\nshe cried, "A demain!"\r\n\r\n"Valentine," thought Hastings, "what a quaint name;" and he started to\r\nfollow the Reverend Joel Byram, who was shuffling towards the nearest\r\ntramway station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n"An\' you are pleas wiz Paris, Monsieur\' Astang?" demanded Madame Marotte\r\nthe next morning as Hastings came into the breakfast-room of the pension,\r\nrosy from his plunge in the limited bath above.\r\n\r\n"I am sure I shall like it," he replied, wondering at his own depression\r\nof spirits.\r\n\r\nThe maid brought him coffee and rolls. He returned the vacant glance of\r\nthe big-headed young man and acknowledged diffidently the salutes of the\r\nsnuffy old gentlemen. He did not try to finish his coffee, and sat\r\ncrumbling a roll, unconscious of the sympathetic glances of Madame\r\nMarotte, who had tact enough not to bother him.\r\n\r\nPresently a maid entered with a tray on which were balanced two bowls of\r\nchocolate, and the snuffy old gentlemen leered at her ankles. The maid\r\ndeposited the chocolate at a table near the window and smiled at Hastings.\r\nThen a thin young lady, followed by her counterpart in all except years,\r\nmarched into the room and took the table near the window. They were\r\nevidently American, but Hastings, if he expected any sign of recognition,\r\nwas disappointed. To be ignored by compatriots intensified his depression.\r\nHe fumbled with his knife and looked at his plate.\r\n\r\nThe thin young lady was talkative enough. She was quite aware of Hastings\'\r\npresence, ready to be flattered if he looked at her, but on the other hand\r\nshe felt her superiority, for she had been three weeks in Paris and he, it\r\nwas easy to see, had not yet unpacked his steamer-trunk.\r\n\r\nHer conversation was complacent. She argued with her mother upon the\r\nrelative merits of the Louvre and the Bon Marche, but her mother\'s part of\r\nthe discussion was mostly confined to the observation, "Why, Susie!"\r\n\r\nThe snuffy old gentlemen had left the room in a body, outwardly polite and\r\ninwardly raging. They could not endure the Americans, who filled the room\r\nwith their chatter.\r\n\r\nThe big-headed young man looked after them with a knowing cough,\r\nmurmuring, "Gay old birds!"\r\n\r\n"They look like bad old men, Mr. Bladen," said the girl.\r\n\r\nTo this Mr. Bladen smiled and said, "They\'ve had their day," in a tone\r\nwhich implied that he was now having his.\r\n\r\n"And that\'s why they all have baggy eyes," cried the girl. "I think it\'s a\r\nshame for young gentlemen--"\r\n\r\n"Why, Susie!" said the mother, and the conversation lagged.\r\n\r\nAfter a while Mr. Bladen threw down the _Petit Journal_, which he daily\r\nstudied at the expense of the house, and turning to Hastings, started to\r\nmake himself agreeable. He began by saying, "I see you are American."\r\n\r\nTo this brilliant and original opening, Hastings, deadly homesick, replied\r\ngratefully, and the conversation was judiciously nourished by observations\r\nfrom Miss Susie Byng distinctly addressed to Mr. Bladen. In the course of\r\nevents Miss Susie, forgetting to address herself exclusively to Mr.\r\nBladen, and Hastings replying to her general question, the _entente\r\ncordiale_ was established, and Susie and her mother extended a\r\nprotectorate over what was clearly neutral territory.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Hastings, you must not desert the pension every evening as Mr. Bladen\r\ndoes. Paris is an awful place for young gentlemen, and Mr. Bladen is a\r\nhorrid cynic."\r\n\r\nMr. Bladen looked gratified.\r\n\r\nHastings answered, "I shall be at the studio all day, and I imagine I\r\nshall be glad enough to come back at night."\r\n\r\nMr. Bladen, who, at a salary of fifteen dollars a week, acted as agent for\r\nthe Pewly Manufacturing Company of Troy, N.Y., smiled a sceptical smile\r\nand withdrew to keep an appointment with a customer on the Boulevard\r\nMagenta.\r\n\r\nHastings walked into the garden with Mrs. Byng and Susie, and, at their\r\ninvitation, sat down in the shade before the iron gate.\r\n\r\nThe chestnut trees still bore their fragrant spikes of pink and white, and\r\nthe bees hummed among the roses, trellised on the white-walled house.\r\n\r\nA faint freshness was in the air. The watering carts moved up and down the\r\nstreet, and a clear stream bubbled over the spotless gutters of the rue de\r\nla Grande Chaumiere. The sparrows were merry along the curb-stones, taking\r\nbath after bath in the water and ruffling their feathers with delight. In\r\na walled garden across the street a pair of blackbirds whistled among the\r\nalmond trees.\r\n\r\nHastings swallowed the lump in his throat, for the song of the birds and\r\nthe ripple of water in a Paris gutter brought back to him the sunny\r\nmeadows of Millbrook.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a blackbird," observed Miss Byng; "see him there on the bush with\r\npink blossoms. He\'s all black except his bill, and that looks as if it had\r\nbeen dipped in an omelet, as some Frenchman says--"\r\n\r\n"Why, Susie!" said Mrs. Byng.\r\n\r\n"That garden belongs to a studio inhabited by two Americans," continued\r\nthe girl serenely, "and I often see them pass. They seem to need a great\r\nmany models, mostly young and feminine--"\r\n\r\n"Why, Susie!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps they prefer painting that kind, but I don\'t see why they should\r\ninvite five, with three more young gentlemen, and all get into two cabs\r\nand drive away singing. This street," she continued, "is dull. There is\r\nnothing to see except the garden and a glimpse of the Boulevard\r\nMontparnasse through the rue de la Grande Chaumiere. No one ever passes\r\nexcept a policeman. There is a convent on the corner."\r\n\r\n"I thought it was a Jesuit College," began Hastings, but was at once\r\noverwhelmed with a Baedecker description of the place, ending with, "On\r\none side stand the palatial hotels of Jean Paul Laurens and Guillaume\r\nBouguereau, and opposite, in the little Passage Stanislas, Carolus Duran\r\npaints the masterpieces which charm the world."\r\n\r\nThe blackbird burst into a ripple of golden throaty notes, and from some\r\ndistant green spot in the city an unknown wild-bird answered with a frenzy\r\nof liquid trills until the sparrows paused in their ablutions to look up\r\nwith restless chirps.\r\n\r\nThen a butterfly came and sat on a cluster of heliotrope and waved his\r\ncrimson-banded wings in the hot sunshine. Hastings knew him for a friend,\r\nand before his eyes there came a vision of tall mulleins and scented\r\nmilkweed alive with painted wings, a vision of a white house and\r\nwoodbine-covered piazza,--a glimpse of a man reading and a woman leaning\r\nover the pansy bed,--and his heart was full. He was startled a moment\r\nlater by Miss Byng.\r\n\r\n"I believe you are homesick!" Hastings blushed. Miss Byng looked at him\r\nwith a sympathetic sigh and continued: "Whenever I felt homesick at first\r\nI used to go with mamma and walk in the Luxembourg Gardens. I don\'t know\r\nwhy it is, but those old-fashioned gardens seemed to bring me nearer home\r\nthan anything in this artificial city."\r\n\r\n"But they are full of marble statues," said Mrs. Byng mildly; "I don\'t see\r\nthe resemblance myself."\r\n\r\n"Where is the Luxembourg?" inquired Hastings after a silence.\r\n\r\n"Come with me to the gate," said Miss Byng. He rose and followed her, and\r\nshe pointed out the rue Vavin at the foot of the street.\r\n\r\n"You pass by the convent to the right," she smiled; and Hastings went.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe Luxembourg was a blaze of flowers. He walked slowly through the long\r\navenues of trees, past mossy marbles and old-time columns, and threading\r\nthe grove by the bronze lion, came upon the tree-crowned terrace above the\r\nfountain. Below lay the basin shining in the sunlight. Flowering almonds\r\nencircled the terrace, and, in a greater spiral, groves of chestnuts wound\r\nin and out and down among the moist thickets by the western palace wing.\r\nAt one end of the avenue of trees the Observatory rose, its white domes\r\npiled up like an eastern mosque; at the other end stood the heavy palace,\r\nwith every window-pane ablaze in the fierce sun of June.\r\n\r\nAround the fountain, children and white-capped nurses armed with bamboo\r\npoles were pushing toy boats, whose sails hung limp in the sunshine. A\r\ndark policeman, wearing red epaulettes and a dress sword, watched them for\r\na while and then went away to remonstrate with a young man who had\r\nunchained his dog. The dog was pleasantly occupied in rubbing grass and\r\ndirt into his back while his legs waved into the air.\r\n\r\nThe policeman pointed at the dog. He was speechless with indignation.\r\n\r\n"Well, Captain," smiled the young fellow.\r\n\r\n"Well, Monsieur Student," growled the policeman.\r\n\r\n"What do you come and complain to me for?"\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t chain him I\'ll take him," shouted the policeman.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that to me, mon capitaine?"\r\n\r\n"Wha--t! Isn\'t that bull-dog yours?"\r\n\r\n"If it was, don\'t you suppose I\'d chain him?"\r\n\r\nThe officer glared for a moment in silence, then deciding that as he was a\r\nstudent he was wicked, grabbed at the dog, who promptly dodged. Around and\r\naround the flower-beds they raced, and when the officer came too near for\r\ncomfort, the bull-dog cut across a flower-bed, which perhaps was not\r\nplaying fair.\r\n\r\nThe young man was amused, and the dog also seemed to enjoy the exercise.\r\n\r\nThe policeman noticed this and decided to strike at the fountain-head of\r\nthe evil. He stormed up to the student and said, "As the owner of this\r\npublic nuisance I arrest you!"\r\n\r\n"But," objected the other, "I disclaim the dog."\r\n\r\nThat was a poser. It was useless to attempt to catch the dog until three\r\ngardeners lent a hand, but then the dog simply ran away and disappeared in\r\nthe rue de Medici.\r\n\r\nThe policeman shambled off to find consolation among the white-capped\r\nnurses, and the student, looking at his watch, stood up yawning. Then\r\ncatching sight of Hastings, he smiled and bowed. Hastings walked over to\r\nthe marble, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Why, Clifford," he said, "I didn\'t recognize you."\r\n\r\n"It\'s my moustache," sighed the other. "I sacrificed it to humour a whim\r\nof--of--a friend. What do you think of my dog?"\r\n\r\n"Then he is yours?" cried Hastings.\r\n\r\n"Of course. It\'s a pleasant change for him, this playing tag with\r\npolicemen, but he is known now and I\'ll have to stop it. He\'s gone home.\r\nHe always does when the gardeners take a hand. It\'s a pity; he\'s fond of\r\nrolling on lawns." Then they chatted for a moment of Hastings\' prospects,\r\nand Clifford politely offered to stand his sponsor at the studio.\r\n\r\n"You see, old tabby, I mean Dr. Byram, told me about you before I met\r\nyou," explained Clifford, "and Elliott and I will be glad to do anything\r\nwe can." Then looking at his watch again, he muttered, "I have just ten\r\nminutes to catch the Versailles train; au revoir," and started to go, but\r\ncatching sight of a girl advancing by the fountain, took off his hat with\r\na confused smile.\r\n\r\n"Why are you not at Versailles?" she said, with an almost imperceptible\r\nacknowledgment of Hastings\' presence.\r\n\r\n"I--I\'m going," murmured Clifford.\r\n\r\nFor a moment they faced each other, and then Clifford, very red,\r\nstammered, "With your permission I have the honour of presenting to you my\r\nfriend, Monsieur Hastings."\r\n\r\nHastings bowed low. She smiled very sweetly, but there was something of\r\nmalice in the quiet inclination of her small Parisienne head.\r\n\r\n"I could have wished," she said, "that Monsieur Clifford might spare me\r\nmore time when he brings with him so charming an American."\r\n\r\n"Must--must I go, Valentine?" began Clifford.\r\n\r\n"Certainly," she replied.\r\n\r\nClifford took his leave with very bad grace, wincing, when she added, "And\r\ngive my dearest love to Cecile!" As he disappeared in the rue d\'Assas, the\r\ngirl turned as if to go, but then suddenly remembering Hastings, looked at\r\nhim and shook her head.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Clifford is so perfectly harebrained," she smiled, "it is\r\nembarrassing sometimes. You have heard, of course, all about his success\r\nat the Salon?"\r\n\r\nHe looked puzzled and she noticed it.\r\n\r\n"You have been to the Salon, of course?"\r\n\r\n"Why, no," he answered, "I only arrived in Paris three days ago."\r\n\r\nShe seemed to pay little heed to his explanation, but continued: "Nobody\r\nimagined he had the energy to do anything good, but on varnishing day the\r\nSalon was astonished by the entrance of Monsieur Clifford, who strolled\r\nabout as bland as you please with an orchid in his buttonhole, and a\r\nbeautiful picture on the line."\r\n\r\nShe smiled to herself at the reminiscence, and looked at the fountain.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Bouguereau told me that Monsieur Julian was so astonished that\r\nhe only shook hands with Monsieur Clifford in a dazed manner, and actually\r\nforgot to pat him on the back! Fancy," she continued with much merriment,\r\n"fancy papa Julian forgetting to pat one on the back."\r\n\r\nHastings, wondering at her acquaintance with the great Bouguereau, looked\r\nat her with respect. "May I ask," he said diffidently, "whether you are a\r\npupil of Bouguereau?"\r\n\r\n"I?" she said in some surprise. Then she looked at him curiously. Was he\r\npermitting himself the liberty of joking on such short acquaintance?\r\n\r\nHis pleasant serious face questioned hers.\r\n\r\n"Tiens," she thought, "what a droll man!"\r\n\r\n"You surely study art?" he said.\r\n\r\nShe leaned back on the crooked stick of her parasol, and looked at him.\r\n"Why do you think so?"\r\n\r\n"Because you speak as if you did."\r\n\r\n"You are making fun of me," she said, "and it is not good taste."\r\n\r\nShe stopped, confused, as he coloured to the roots of his hair.\r\n\r\n"How long have you been in Paris?" she said at length.\r\n\r\n"Three days," he replied gravely.\r\n\r\n"But--but--surely you are not a nouveau! You speak French too well!"\r\n\r\nThen after a pause, "Really are you a nouveau?"\r\n\r\n"I am," he said.\r\n\r\nShe sat down on the marble bench lately occupied by Clifford, and tilting\r\nher parasol over her small head looked at him.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe it."\r\n\r\nHe felt the compliment, and for a moment hesitated to declare himself one\r\nof the despised. Then mustering up his courage, he told her how new and\r\ngreen he was, and all with a frankness which made her blue eyes open very\r\nwide and her lips part in the sweetest of smiles.\r\n\r\n"You have never seen a studio?"\r\n\r\n"Never."\r\n\r\n"Nor a model?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"How funny," she said solemnly. Then they both laughed.\r\n\r\n"And you," he said, "have seen studios?"\r\n\r\n"Hundreds."\r\n\r\n"And models?"\r\n\r\n"Millions."\r\n\r\n"And you know Bouguereau?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and Henner, and Constant and Laurens, and Puvis de Chavannes and\r\nDagnan and Courtois, and--and all the rest of them!"\r\n\r\n"And yet you say you are not an artist."\r\n\r\n"Pardon," she said gravely, "did I say I was not?"\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you tell me?" he hesitated.\r\n\r\nAt first she looked at him, shaking her head and smiling, then of a sudden\r\nher eyes fell and she began tracing figures with her parasol in the gravel\r\nat her feet. Hastings had taken a place on the seat, and now, with his\r\nelbows on his knees, sat watching the spray drifting above the fountain\r\njet. A small boy, dressed as a sailor, stood poking his yacht and crying,\r\n"I won\'t go home! I won\'t go home!" His nurse raised her hands to Heaven.\r\n\r\n"Just like a little American boy," thought Hastings, and a pang of\r\nhomesickness shot through him.\r\n\r\nPresently the nurse captured the boat, and the small boy stood at bay.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Rene, when you decide to come here you may have your boat."\r\n\r\nThe boy backed away scowling.\r\n\r\n"Give me my boat, I say," he cried, "and don\'t call me Rene, for my\r\nname\'s Randall and you know it!"\r\n\r\n"Hello!" said Hastings,--"Randall?--that\'s English."\r\n\r\n"I am American," announced the boy in perfectly good English, turning to\r\nlook at Hastings, "and she\'s such a fool she calls me Rene because mamma\r\ncalls me Ranny--"\r\n\r\nHere he dodged the exasperated nurse and took up his station behind\r\nHastings, who laughed, and catching him around the waist lifted him into\r\nhis lap.\r\n\r\n"One of my countrymen," he said to the girl beside him. He smiled while he\r\nspoke, but there was a queer feeling in his throat.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you see the stars and stripes on my yacht?" demanded Randall. Sure\r\nenough, the American colours hung limply under the nurse\'s arm.\r\n\r\n"Oh," cried the girl, "he is charming," and impulsively stooped to kiss\r\nhim, but the infant Randall wriggled out of Hastings\' arms, and his nurse\r\npounced upon him with an angry glance at the girl.\r\n\r\nShe reddened and then bit her lips as the nurse, with eyes still fixed on\r\nher, dragged the child away and ostentatiously wiped his lips with her\r\nhandkerchief.\r\n\r\nThen she stole a look at Hastings and bit her lip again.\r\n\r\n"What an ill-tempered woman!" he said. "In America, most nurses are\r\nflattered when people kiss their children."\r\n\r\nFor an instant she tipped the parasol to hide her face, then closed it\r\nwith a snap and looked at him defiantly.\r\n\r\n"Do you think it strange that she objected?"\r\n\r\n"Why not?" he said in surprise.\r\n\r\nAgain she looked at him with quick searching eyes.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were clear and bright, and he smiled back, repeating, "Why not?"\r\n\r\n"You _are_ droll," she murmured, bending her head.\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\nBut she made no answer, and sat silent, tracing curves and circles in the\r\ndust with her parasol. After a while he said--"I am glad to see that young\r\npeople have so much liberty here. I understood that the French were not at\r\nall like us. You know in America--or at least where I live in Milbrook,\r\ngirls have every liberty,--go out alone and receive their friends alone,\r\nand I was afraid I should miss it here. But I see how it is now, and I am\r\nglad I was mistaken."\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes to his and kept them there.\r\n\r\nHe continued pleasantly--"Since I have sat here I have seen a lot of\r\npretty girls walking alone on the terrace there,--and then _you_ are alone\r\ntoo. Tell me, for I do not know French customs,--do you have the liberty\r\nof going to the theatre without a chaperone?"\r\n\r\nFor a long time she studied his face, and then with a trembling smile\r\nsaid, "Why do you ask me?"\r\n\r\n"Because you must know, of course," he said gaily.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she replied indifferently, "I know."\r\n\r\nHe waited for an answer, but getting none, decided that perhaps she had\r\nmisunderstood him.\r\n\r\n"I hope you don\'t think I mean to presume on our short acquaintance," he\r\nbegan,--"in fact it is very odd but I don\'t know your name. When Mr.\r\nClifford presented me he only mentioned mine. Is that the custom in\r\nFrance?"\r\n\r\n"It is the custom in the Latin Quarter," she said with a queer light in\r\nher eyes. Then suddenly she began talking almost feverishly.\r\n\r\n"You must know, Monsieur Hastings, that we are all _un peu sans gene_ here\r\nin the Latin Quarter. We are very Bohemian, and etiquette and ceremony are\r\nout of place. It was for that Monsieur Clifford presented you to me with\r\nsmall ceremony, and left us together with less,--only for that, and I am\r\nhis friend, and I have many friends in the Latin Quarter, and we all know\r\neach other very well--and I am not studying art, but--but--"\r\n\r\n"But what?" he said, bewildered.\r\n\r\n"I shall not tell you,--it is a secret," she said with an uncertain smile.\r\nOn both cheeks a pink spot was burning, and her eyes were very bright.\r\n\r\nThen in a moment her face fell. "Do you know Monsieur Clifford very\r\nintimately?"\r\n\r\n"Not very."\r\n\r\nAfter a while she turned to him, grave and a little pale.\r\n\r\n"My name is Valentine--Valentine Tissot. Might--might I ask a service of\r\nyou on such very short acquaintance?"\r\n\r\n"Oh," he cried, "I should be honoured."\r\n\r\n"It is only this," she said gently, "it is not much. Promise me not to\r\nspeak to Monsieur Clifford about me. Promise me that you will speak to no\r\none about me."\r\n\r\n"I promise," he said, greatly puzzled.\r\n\r\nShe laughed nervously. "I wish to remain a mystery. It is a caprice."\r\n\r\n"But," he began, "I had wished, I had hoped that you might give Monsieur\r\nClifford permission to bring me, to present me at your house."\r\n\r\n"My--my house!" she repeated.\r\n\r\n"I mean, where you live, in fact, to present me to your family."\r\n\r\nThe change in the girl\'s face shocked him.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon," he cried, "I have hurt you."\r\n\r\nAnd as quick as a flash she understood him because she was a woman.\r\n\r\n"My parents are dead," she said.\r\n\r\nPresently he began again, very gently.\r\n\r\n"Would it displease you if I beg you to receive me? It is the custom?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot," she answered. Then glancing up at him, "I am sorry; I should\r\nlike to; but believe me. I cannot."\r\n\r\nHe bowed seriously and looked vaguely uneasy.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t because I don\'t wish to. I--I like you; you are very kind to\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Kind?" he cried, surprised and puzzled.\r\n\r\n"I like you," she said slowly, "and we will see each other sometimes if\r\nyou will."\r\n\r\n"At friends\' houses."\r\n\r\n"No, not at friends\' houses."\r\n\r\n"Where?"\r\n\r\n"Here," she said with defiant eyes.\r\n\r\n"Why," he cried, "in Paris you are much more liberal in your views than we\r\nare."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him curiously.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we are very Bohemian."\r\n\r\n"I think it is charming," he declared.\r\n\r\n"You see, we shall be in the best of society," she ventured timidly, with\r\na pretty gesture toward the statues of the dead queens, ranged in stately\r\nranks above the terrace.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, delighted, and she brightened at the success of her\r\ninnocent little pleasantry.\r\n\r\n"Indeed," she smiled, "I shall be well chaperoned, because you see we are\r\nunder the protection of the gods themselves; look, there are Apollo, and\r\nJuno, and Venus, on their pedestals," counting them on her small gloved\r\nfingers, "and Ceres, Hercules, and--but I can\'t make out--"\r\n\r\nHastings turned to look up at the winged god under whose shadow they were\r\nseated.\r\n\r\n"Why, it\'s Love," he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n"There is a nouveau here," drawled Laffat, leaning around his easel and\r\naddressing his friend Bowles, "there is a nouveau here who is so tender\r\nand green and appetizing that Heaven help him if he should fall into a\r\nsalad bowl."\r\n\r\n"Hayseed?" inquired Bowles, plastering in a background with a broken\r\npalette-knife and squinting at the effect with approval.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Squeedunk or Oshkosh, and how he ever grew up among the daisies and\r\nescaped the cows, Heaven alone knows!"\r\n\r\nBowles rubbed his thumb across the outlines of his study to "throw in a\r\nlittle atmosphere," as he said, glared at the model, pulled at his pipe\r\nand finding it out struck a match on his neighbour\'s back to relight it.\r\n\r\n"His name," continued Laffat, hurling a bit of bread at the hat-rack, "his\r\nname is Hastings. He _is_ a berry. He knows no more about the world,"--and\r\nhere Mr. Laffat\'s face spoke volumes for his own knowledge of that\r\nplanet,--"than a maiden cat on its first moonlight stroll."\r\n\r\nBowles now having succeeded in lighting his pipe, repeated the thumb touch\r\non the other edge of the study and said, "Ah!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," continued his friend, "and would you imagine it, he seems to think\r\nthat everything here goes on as it does in his d----d little backwoods\r\nranch at home; talks about the pretty girls who walk alone in the street;\r\nsays how sensible it is; and how French parents are misrepresented in\r\nAmerica; says that for his part he finds French girls,--and he confessed\r\nto only knowing one,--as jolly as American girls. I tried to set him\r\nright, tried to give him a pointer as to what sort of ladies walk about\r\nalone or with students, and he was either too stupid or too innocent to\r\ncatch on. Then I gave it to him straight, and he said I was a vile-minded\r\nfool and marched off."\r\n\r\n"Did you assist him with your shoe?" inquired Bowles, languidly\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\n"Well, no."\r\n\r\n"He called you a vile-minded fool."\r\n\r\n"He was correct," said Clifford from his easel in front.\r\n\r\n"What--what do you mean?" demanded Laffat, turning red.\r\n\r\n"_That_," replied Clifford.\r\n\r\n"Who spoke to you? Is this your business?" sneered Bowles, but nearly lost\r\nhis balance as Clifford swung about and eyed him.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said slowly, "it\'s my business."\r\n\r\nNo one spoke for some time.\r\n\r\nThen Clifford sang out, "I say, Hastings!"\r\n\r\nAnd when Hastings left his easel and came around, he nodded toward the\r\nastonished Laffat.\r\n\r\n"This man has been disagreeable to you, and I want to tell you that any\r\ntime you feel inclined to kick him, why, I will hold the other creature."\r\n\r\nHastings, embarrassed, said, "Why no, I don\'t agree with his ideas,\r\nnothing more."\r\n\r\nClifford said "Naturally," and slipping his arm through Hastings\',\r\nstrolled about with him, and introduced him to several of his own friends,\r\nat which all the nouveaux opened their eyes with envy, and the studio were\r\ngiven to understand that Hastings, although prepared to do menial work as\r\nthe latest nouveau, was already within the charmed circle of the old,\r\nrespected and feared, the truly great.\r\n\r\nThe rest finished, the model resumed his place, and work went on in a\r\nchorus of songs and yells and every ear-splitting noise which the art\r\nstudent utters when studying the beautiful.\r\n\r\nFive o\'clock struck,--the model yawned, stretched and climbed into his\r\ntrousers, and the noisy contents of six studios crowded through the hall\r\nand down into the street. Ten minutes later, Hastings found himself on top\r\nof a Montrouge tram, and shortly afterward was joined by Clifford.\r\n\r\nThey climbed down at the rue Gay Lussac.\r\n\r\n"I always stop here," observed Clifford, "I like the walk through the\r\nLuxembourg."\r\n\r\n"By the way," said Hastings, "how can I call on you when I don\'t know\r\nwhere you live?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I live opposite you."\r\n\r\n"What--the studio in the garden where the almond trees are and the\r\nblackbirds--"\r\n\r\n"Exactly," said Clifford. "I\'m with my friend Elliott."\r\n\r\nHastings thought of the description of the two American artists which he\r\nhad heard from Miss Susie Byng, and looked blank.\r\n\r\nClifford continued, "Perhaps you had better let me know when you think of\r\ncoming so,--so that I will be sure to--to be there," he ended rather\r\nlamely.\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t care to meet any of your model friends there," said Hastings,\r\nsmiling. "You know--my ideas are rather straitlaced,--I suppose you would\r\nsay, Puritanical. I shouldn\'t enjoy it and wouldn\'t know how to behave."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I understand," said Clifford, but added with great cordiality,--"I\'m\r\nsure we\'ll be friends although you may not approve of me and my set, but\r\nyou will like Severn and Selby because--because, well, they are like\r\nyourself, old chap."\r\n\r\nAfter a moment he continued, "There is something I want to speak about.\r\nYou see, when I introduced you, last week, in the Luxembourg, to\r\nValentine--"\r\n\r\n"Not a word!" cried Hastings, smiling; "you must not tell me a word of\r\nher!"\r\n\r\n"Why--"\r\n\r\n"No--not a word!" he said gaily. "I insist,--promise me upon your honour\r\nyou will not speak of her until I give you permission; promise!"\r\n\r\n"I promise," said Clifford, amazed.\r\n\r\n"She is a charming girl,--we had such a delightful chat after you left,\r\nand I thank you for presenting me, but not another word about her until I\r\ngive you permission."\r\n\r\n"Oh," murmured Clifford.\r\n\r\n"Remember your promise," he smiled, as he turned into his gateway.\r\n\r\nClifford strolled across the street and, traversing the ivy-covered alley,\r\nentered his garden.\r\n\r\nHe felt for his studio key, muttering, "I wonder--I wonder,--but of course\r\nhe doesn\'t!"\r\n\r\nHe entered the hallway, and fitting the key into the door, stood staring\r\nat the two cards tacked over the panels.\r\n\r\n  FOXHALL CLIFFORD\r\n\r\n  RICHARD OSBORNE ELLIOTT\r\n\r\n"Why the devil doesn\'t he want me to speak of her?"\r\n\r\nHe opened the door, and, discouraging the caresses of two brindle\r\nbull-dogs, sank down on the sofa.\r\n\r\nElliott sat smoking and sketching with a piece of charcoal by the window.\r\n\r\n"Hello," he said without looking around.\r\n\r\nClifford gazed absently at the back of his head, murmuring, "I\'m afraid,\r\nI\'m afraid that man is too innocent. I say, Elliott," he said, at last,\r\n"Hastings,--you know the chap that old Tabby Byram came around here to\r\ntell us about--the day you had to hide Colette in the armoire--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, what\'s up?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing. He\'s a brick."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Elliott, without enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think so?" demanded Clifford.\r\n\r\n"Why yes, but he is going to have a tough time when some of his illusions\r\nare dispelled."\r\n\r\n"More shame to those who dispel \'em!"\r\n\r\n"Yes,--wait until he comes to pay his call on us, unexpectedly, of\r\ncourse--"\r\n\r\nClifford looked virtuous and lighted a cigar.\r\n\r\n"I was just going to say," he observed, "that I have asked him not to come\r\nwithout letting us know, so I can postpone any orgie you may have\r\nintended--"\r\n\r\n"Ah!" cried Elliott indignantly, "I suppose you put it to him in that\r\nway."\r\n\r\n"Not exactly," grinned Clifford. Then more seriously, "I don\'t want\r\nanything to occur here to bother him. He\'s a brick, and it\'s a pity we\r\ncan\'t be more like him."\r\n\r\n"I am," observed Elliott complacently, "only living with you--"\r\n\r\n"Listen!" cried the other. "I have managed to put my foot in it in great\r\nstyle. Do you know what I\'ve done? Well--the first time I met him in the\r\nstreet,--or rather, it was in the Luxembourg, I introduced him to\r\nValentine!"\r\n\r\n"Did he object?"\r\n\r\n"Believe me," said Clifford, solemnly, "this rustic Hastings has no more\r\nidea that Valentine is--is--in fact is Valentine, than he has that he\r\nhimself is a beautiful example of moral decency in a Quarter where morals\r\nare as rare as elephants. I heard enough in a conversation between that\r\nblackguard Loffat and the little immoral eruption, Bowles, to open my\r\neyes. I tell you Hastings is a trump! He\'s a healthy, clean-minded young\r\nfellow, bred in a small country village, brought up with the idea that\r\nsaloons are way-stations to hell--and as for women--"\r\n\r\n"Well?" demanded Elliott\r\n\r\n"Well," said Clifford, "his idea of the dangerous woman is probably a\r\npainted Jezabel."\r\n\r\n"Probably," replied the other.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a trump!" said Clifford, "and if he swears the world is as good and\r\npure as his own heart, I\'ll swear he\'s right."\r\n\r\nElliott rubbed his charcoal on his file to get a point and turned to his\r\nsketch saying, "He will never hear any pessimism from Richard Osborne E."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a lesson to me," said Clifford. Then he unfolded a small perfumed\r\nnote, written on rose-coloured paper, which had been lying on the table\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nHe read it, smiled, whistled a bar or two from "Miss Helyett," and sat\r\ndown to answer it on his best cream-laid note-paper. When it was written\r\nand sealed, he picked up his stick and marched up and down the studio two\r\nor three times, whistling.\r\n\r\n"Going out?" inquired the other, without turning.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, but lingered a moment over Elliott\'s shoulder, watching\r\nhim pick out the lights in his sketch with a bit of bread.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow is Sunday," he observed after a moment\'s silence.\r\n\r\n"Well?" inquired Elliott.\r\n\r\n"Have you seen Colette?"\r\n\r\n"No, I will to-night. She and Rowden and Jacqueline are coming to\r\nBoulant\'s. I suppose you and, Cecile will be there?"\r\n\r\n"Well, no," replied Clifford. "Cecile dines at home to-night, and I--I had\r\nan idea of going to Mignon\'s."\r\n\r\nElliott looked at him with disapproval.\r\n\r\n"You can make all the arrangements for La Roche without me," he continued,\r\navoiding Elliott\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"What are you up to now?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing," protested Clifford.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell me," replied his chum, with scorn; "fellows don\'t rush off to\r\nMignon\'s when the set dine at Boulant\'s. Who is it now?--but no, I won\'t\r\nask that,--what\'s the use!" Then he lifted up his voice in complaint and\r\nbeat upon the table with his pipe. "What\'s the use of ever trying to keep\r\ntrack of you? What will Cecile say,--oh, yes, what will she say? It\'s a\r\npity you can\'t be constant two months, yes, by Jove! and the Quarter is\r\nindulgent, but you abuse its good nature and mine too!"\r\n\r\nPresently he arose, and jamming his hat on his head, marched to the door.\r\n\r\n"Heaven alone knows why any one puts up with your antics, but they all do\r\nand so do I. If I were Cecile or any of the other pretty fools after whom\r\nyou have toddled and will, in all human probabilities, continue to toddle,\r\nI say, if I were Cecile I\'d spank you! Now I\'m going to Boulant\'s, and as\r\nusual I shall make excuses for you and arrange the affair, and I don\'t\r\ncare a continental where you are going, but, by the skull of the studio\r\nskeleton! if you don\'t turn up to-morrow with your sketching-kit under one\r\narm and Cecile under the other,--if you don\'t turn up in good shape, I\'m\r\ndone with you, and the rest can think what they please. Good-night."\r\n\r\nClifford said good-night with as pleasant a smile as he could muster, and\r\nthen sat down with his eyes on the door. He took out his watch and gave\r\nElliott ten minutes to vanish, then rang the concierge\'s call, murmuring,\r\n"Oh dear, oh dear, why the devil do I do it?"\r\n\r\n"Alfred," he said, as that gimlet-eyed person answered the call, "make\r\nyourself clean and proper, Alfred, and replace your sabots with a pair of\r\nshoes. Then put on your best hat and take this letter to the big white\r\nhouse in the Rue de Dragon. There is no answer, _mon petit_ Alfred."\r\n\r\nThe concierge departed with a snort in which unwillingness for the errand\r\nand affection for M. Clifford were blended. Then with great care the young\r\nfellow arrayed himself in all the beauties of his and Elliott\'s wardrobe.\r\nHe took his time about it, and occasionally interrupted his toilet to play\r\nhis banjo or make pleasing diversion for the bull-dogs by gambling about\r\non all fours. "I\'ve got two hours before me," he thought, and borrowed a\r\npair of Elliott\'s silken foot-gear, with which he and the dogs played ball\r\nuntil he decided to put them on. Then he lighted a cigarette and inspected\r\nhis dress-coat. When he had emptied it of four handkerchiefs, a fan, and a\r\npair of crumpled gloves as long as his arm, he decided it was not suited\r\nto add _eclat_ to his charms and cast about in his mind for a substitute.\r\nElliott was too thin, and, anyway, his coats were now under lock and key.\r\nRowden probably was as badly off as himself. Hastings! Hastings was the\r\nman! But when he threw on a smoking-jacket and sauntered over to Hastings\'\r\nhouse, he was informed that he had been gone over an hour.\r\n\r\n"Now, where in the name of all that\'s reasonable could he have gone!"\r\nmuttered Clifford, looking down the street.\r\n\r\nThe maid didn\'t know, so he bestowed upon her a fascinating smile and\r\nlounged back to the studio.\r\n\r\nHastings was not far away. The Luxembourg is within five minutes\' walk of\r\nthe rue Notre Dame des Champs, and there he sat under the shadow of a\r\nwinged god, and there he had sat for an hour, poking holes in the dust and\r\nwatching the steps which lead from the northern terrace to the fountain.\r\nThe sun hung, a purple globe, above the misty hills of Meudon. Long\r\nstreamers of clouds touched with rose swept low on the western sky, and\r\nthe dome of the distant Invalides burned like an opal through the haze.\r\nBehind the Palace the smoke from a high chimney mounted straight into the\r\nair, purple until it crossed the sun, where it changed to a bar of\r\nsmouldering fire. High above the darkening foliage of the chestnuts the\r\ntwin towers of St. Sulpice rose, an ever-deepening silhouette.\r\n\r\nA sleepy blackbird was carolling in some near thicket, and pigeons passed\r\nand repassed with the whisper of soft winds in their wings. The light on\r\nthe Palace windows had died away, and the dome of the Pantheon swam aglow\r\nabove the northern terrace, a fiery Valhalla in the sky; while below in\r\ngrim array, along the terrace ranged, the marble ranks of queens looked\r\nout into the west.\r\n\r\nFrom the end of the long walk by the northern facade of the Palace came\r\nthe noise of omnibuses and the cries of the street. Hastings looked at the\r\nPalace clock. Six, and as his own watch agreed with it, he fell to poking\r\nholes in the gravel again. A constant stream of people passed between the\r\nOdeon and the fountain. Priests in black, with silver-buckled shoes; line\r\nsoldiers, slouchy and rakish; neat girls without hats bearing milliners\'\r\nboxes, students with black portfolios and high hats, students with berets\r\nand big canes, nervous, quick-stepping officers, symphonies in turquoise\r\nand silver; ponderous jangling cavalrymen all over dust, pastry cooks\'\r\nboys skipping along with utter disregard for the safety of the basket\r\nbalanced on the impish head, and then the lean outcast, the shambling\r\nParis tramp, slouching with shoulders bent and little eye furtively\r\nscanning the ground for smokers\' refuse;--all these moved in a steady\r\nstream across the fountain circle and out into the city by the Odeon,\r\nwhose long arcades were now beginning to flicker with gas-jets. The\r\nmelancholy bells of St Sulpice struck the hour and the clock-tower of the\r\nPalace lighted up. Then hurried steps sounded across the gravel and\r\nHastings raised his head.\r\n\r\n"How late you are," he said, but his voice was hoarse and only his flushed\r\nface told how long had seemed the waiting.\r\n\r\nShe said, "I was kept--indeed, I was so much annoyed--and--and I may only\r\nstay a moment."\r\n\r\nShe sat down beside him, casting a furtive glance over her shoulder at the\r\ngod upon his pedestal.\r\n\r\n"What a nuisance, that intruding cupid still there?"\r\n\r\n"Wings and arrows too," said Hastings, unheeding her motion to be seated.\r\n\r\n"Wings," she murmured, "oh, yes--to fly away with when he\'s tired of his\r\nplay. Of course it was a man who conceived the idea of wings, otherwise\r\nCupid would have been insupportable."\r\n\r\n"Do you think so?"\r\n\r\n"_Ma foi_, it\'s what men think."\r\n\r\n"And women?"\r\n\r\n"Oh," she said, with a toss of her small head, "I really forget what we\r\nwere speaking of."\r\n\r\n"We were speaking of love," said Hastings.\r\n\r\n"_I_ was not," said the girl. Then looking up at the marble god, "I don\'t\r\ncare for this one at all. I don\'t believe he knows how to shoot his\r\narrows--no, indeed, he is a coward;--he creeps up like an assassin in the\r\ntwilight. I don\'t approve of cowardice," she announced, and turned her\r\nback on the statue.\r\n\r\n"I think," said Hastings quietly, "that he does shoot fairly--yes, and\r\neven gives one warning."\r\n\r\n"Is it your experience, Monsieur Hastings?"\r\n\r\nHe looked straight into her eyes and said, "He is warning me."\r\n\r\n"Heed the warning then," she cried, with a nervous laugh. As she spoke she\r\nstripped off her gloves, and then carefully proceeded to draw them on\r\nagain. When this was accomplished she glanced at the Palace clock, saying,\r\n"Oh dear, how late it is!" furled her umbrella, then unfurled it, and\r\nfinally looked at him.\r\n\r\n"No," he said, "I shall not heed his warning."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear," she sighed again, "still talking about that tiresome statue!"\r\nThen stealing a glance at his face, "I suppose--I suppose you are in\r\nlove."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," he muttered, "I suppose I am."\r\n\r\nShe raised her head with a quick gesture. "You seem delighted at the\r\nidea," she said, but bit her lip and trembled as his eyes met hers. Then\r\nsudden fear came over her and she sprang up, staring into the gathering\r\nshadows.\r\n\r\n"Are you cold?" he said.\r\n\r\nBut she only answered, "Oh dear, oh dear, it is late--so late! I must\r\ngo--good-night."\r\n\r\nShe gave him her gloved hand a moment and then withdrew it with a start.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" he insisted. "Are you frightened?"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him strangely.\r\n\r\n"No--no--not frightened,--you are very good to me--"\r\n\r\n"By Jove!" he burst out, "what do you mean by saying I\'m good to you?\r\nThat\'s at least the third time, and I don\'t understand!"\r\n\r\nThe sound of a drum from the guard-house at the palace cut him short.\r\n"Listen," she whispered, "they are going to close. It\'s late, oh, so\r\nlate!"\r\n\r\nThe rolling of the drum came nearer and nearer, and then the silhouette of\r\nthe drummer cut the sky above the eastern terrace. The fading light\r\nlingered a moment on his belt and bayonet, then he passed into the\r\nshadows, drumming the echoes awake. The roll became fainter along the\r\neastern terrace, then grew and grew and rattled with increasing sharpness\r\nwhen he passed the avenue by the bronze lion and turned down the western\r\nterrace walk. Louder and louder the drum sounded, and the echoes struck\r\nback the notes from the grey palace wall; and now the drummer loomed up\r\nbefore them--his red trousers a dull spot in the gathering gloom, the\r\nbrass of his drum and bayonet touched with a pale spark, his epaulettes\r\ntossing on his shoulders. He passed leaving the crash of the drum in their\r\nears, and far into the alley of trees they saw his little tin cup shining\r\non his haversack. Then the sentinels began the monotonous cry: "On ferme!\r\non ferme!" and the bugle blew from the barracks in the rue de Tournon.\r\n\r\n"On ferme! on ferme!"\r\n\r\n"Good-night," she whispered, "I must return alone to-night."\r\n\r\nHe watched her until she reached the northern terrace, and then sat down\r\non the marble seat until a hand on his shoulder and a glimmer of bayonets\r\nwarned him away.\r\n\r\nShe passed on through the grove, and turning into the rue de Medici,\r\ntraversed it to the Boulevard. At the corner she bought a bunch of violets\r\nand walked on along the Boulevard to the rue des Ecoles. A cab was drawn\r\nup before Boulant\'s, and a pretty girl aided by Elliott jumped out.\r\n\r\n"Valentine!" cried the girl, "come with us!"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t," she said, stopping a moment--"I have a rendezvous at Mignon\'s."\r\n\r\n"Not Victor?" cried the girl, laughing, but she passed with a little\r\nshiver, nodding good-night, then turning into the Boulevard St. Germain,\r\nshe walked a tittle faster to escape a gay party sitting before the Cafe\r\nCluny who called to her to join them. At the door of the Restaurant Mignon\r\nstood a coal-black negro in buttons. He took off his peaked cap as she\r\nmounted the carpeted stairs.\r\n\r\n"Send Eugene to me," she said at the office, and passing through the\r\nhallway to the right of the dining-room stopped before a row of panelled\r\ndoors. A waiter passed and she repeated her demand for Eugene, who\r\npresently appeared, noiselessly skipping, and bowed murmuring, "Madame."\r\n\r\n"Who is here?"\r\n\r\n"No one in the cabinets, madame; in the half Madame Madelon and Monsieur\r\nGay, Monsieur de Clamart, Monsieur Clisson, Madame Marie and their set."\r\nThen he looked around and bowing again murmured, "Monsieur awaits madame\r\nsince half an hour," and he knocked at one of the panelled doors bearing\r\nthe number six.\r\n\r\nClifford opened the door and the girl entered.\r\n\r\nThe garcon bowed her in, and whispering, "Will Monsieur have the goodness\r\nto ring?" vanished.\r\n\r\nHe helped her off with her jacket and took her hat and umbrella. When she\r\nwas seated at the little table with Clifford opposite she smiled and\r\nleaned forward on both elbows looking him in the face.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing here?" she demanded.\r\n\r\n"Waiting," he replied, in accents of adoration.\r\n\r\nFor an instant she turned and examined herself in the glass. The wide blue\r\neyes, the curling hair, the straight nose and short curled lip flashed in\r\nthe mirror an instant only, and then its depths reflected her pretty neck\r\nand back. "Thus do I turn my back on vanity," she said, and then leaning\r\nforward again, "What are you doing here?"\r\n\r\n"Waiting for you," repeated Clifford, slightly troubled.\r\n\r\n"And Cecile."\r\n\r\n"Now don\'t, Valentine--"\r\n\r\n"Do you know," she said calmly, "I dislike your conduct?"\r\n\r\nHe was a little disconcerted, and rang for Eugene to cover his confusion.\r\n\r\nThe soup was bisque, and the wine Pommery, and the courses followed each\r\nother with the usual regularity until Eugene brought coffee, and there was\r\nnothing left on the table but a small silver lamp.\r\n\r\n"Valentine," said Clifford, after having obtained permission to smoke, "is\r\nit the Vaudeville or the Eldorado--or both, or the Nouveau Cirque, or--"\r\n\r\n"It is here," said Valentine.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said, greatly flattered, "I\'m afraid I couldn\'t amuse you--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, you are funnier than the Eldorado."\r\n\r\n"Now see here, don\'t guy me, Valentine. You always do, and, and,--you know\r\nwhat they say,--a good laugh kills--"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Er--er--love and all that."\r\n\r\nShe laughed until her eyes were moist with tears. "Tiens," she cried, "he\r\nis dead, then!"\r\n\r\nClifford eyed her with growing alarm.\r\n\r\n"Do you know why I came?" she said.\r\n\r\n"No," he replied uneasily, "I don\'t."\r\n\r\n"How long have you made love to me?"\r\n\r\n"Well," he admitted, somewhat startled,--"I should say,--for about a\r\nyear."\r\n\r\n"It is a year, I think. Are you not tired?"\r\n\r\nHe did not answer.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know that I like you too well to--to ever fall in love with\r\nyou?" she said. "Don\'t you know that we are too good comrades,--too old\r\nfriends for that? And were we not,--do you think that I do not know your\r\nhistory, Monsieur Clifford?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be--don\'t be so sarcastic," he urged; "don\'t be unkind, Valentine."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not. I\'m kind. I\'m very kind,--to you and to Cecile."\r\n\r\n"Cecile is tired of me."\r\n\r\n"I hope she is," said the girl, "for she deserves a better fate. Tiens, do\r\nyou know your reputation in the Quarter? Of the inconstant, the most\r\ninconstant,--utterly incorrigible and no more serious than a gnat on a\r\nsummer night. Poor Cecile!"\r\n\r\nClifford looked so uncomfortable that she spoke more kindly.\r\n\r\n"I like you. You know that. Everybody does. You are a spoiled child here.\r\nEverything is permitted you and every one makes allowance, but every one\r\ncannot be a victim to caprice."\r\n\r\n"Caprice!" he cried. "By Jove, if the girls of the Latin Quarter are not\r\ncapricious--"\r\n\r\n"Never mind,--never mind about that! You must not sit in judgment--you of\r\nall men. Why are you here to-night? Oh," she cried, "I will tell you why!\r\nMonsieur receives a little note; he sends a little answer; he dresses in\r\nhis conquering raiment--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t," said Clifford, very red.\r\n\r\n"You do, and it becomes you," she retorted with a faint smile. Then again,\r\nvery quietly, "I am in your power, but I know I am in the power of a\r\nfriend. I have come to acknowledge it to you here,--and it is because of\r\nthat that I am here to beg of you--a--a favour."\r\n\r\nClifford opened his eyes, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n"I am in--great distress of mind. It is Monsieur Hastings."\r\n\r\n"Well?" said Clifford, in some astonishment.\r\n\r\n"I want to ask you," she continued in a low voice, "I want to ask you\r\nto--to--in case you should speak of me before him,--not to say,--not to\r\nsay,--"\r\n\r\n"I shall not speak of you to him," he said quietly.\r\n\r\n"Can--can you prevent others?"\r\n\r\n"I might if I was present. May I ask why?"\r\n\r\n"That is not fair," she murmured; "you know how--how he considers me,--as\r\nhe considers every woman. You know how different he is from you and the\r\nrest. I have never seen a man,--such a man as Monsieur Hastings."\r\n\r\nHe let his cigarette go out unnoticed.\r\n\r\n"I am almost afraid of him--afraid he should know--what we all are in the\r\nQuarter. Oh, I do not wish him to know! I do not wish him to--to turn from\r\nme--to cease from speaking to me as he does! You--you and the rest cannot\r\nknow what it has been to me. I could not believe him,--I could not believe\r\nhe was so good and--and noble. I do not wish him to know--so soon. He will\r\nfind out--sooner or later, he will find out for himself, and then he will\r\nturn away from me. Why!" she cried passionately, "why should he turn from\r\nme and not from _you_?"\r\n\r\nClifford, much embarrassed, eyed his cigarette.\r\n\r\nThe girl rose, very white. "He is your friend--you have a right to warn\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"He is my friend," he said at length.\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other in silence.\r\n\r\nThen she cried, "By all that I hold to me most sacred, you need not warn\r\nhim!"\r\n\r\n"I shall trust your word," he said pleasantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe month passed quickly for Hastings, and left few definite impressions\r\nafter it. It did leave some, however. One was a painful impression of\r\nmeeting Mr. Bladen on the Boulevard des Capucines in company with a very\r\npronounced young person whose laugh dismayed him, and when at last he\r\nescaped from the cafe where Mr. Bladen had hauled him to join them in a\r\n_bock_ he felt as if the whole boulevard was looking at him, and judging\r\nhim by his company. Later, an instinctive conviction regarding the young\r\nperson with Mr. Bladen sent the hot blood into his cheek, and he returned\r\nto the pension in such a miserable state of mind that Miss Byng was\r\nalarmed and advised him to conquer his homesickness at once.\r\n\r\nAnother impression was equally vivid. One Saturday morning, feeling\r\nlonely, his wanderings about the city brought him to the Gare St. Lazare.\r\nIt was early for breakfast, but he entered the Hotel Terminus and took a\r\ntable near the window. As he wheeled about to give his order, a man\r\npassing rapidly along the aisle collided with his head, and looking up to\r\nreceive the expected apology, he was met instead by a slap on the shoulder\r\nand a hearty, "What the deuce are you doing here, old chap?" It was\r\nRowden, who seized him and told him to come along. So, mildly protesting,\r\nhe was ushered into a private dining-room where Clifford, rather red,\r\njumped up from the table and welcomed him with a startled air which was\r\nsoftened by the unaffected glee of Rowden and the extreme courtesy of\r\nElliott. The latter presented him to three bewitching girls who welcomed\r\nhim so charmingly and seconded Rowden in his demand that Hastings should\r\nmake one of the party, that he consented at once. While Elliott briefly\r\noutlined the projected excursion to La Roche, Hastings delightedly ate his\r\nomelet, and returned the smiles of encouragement from Cecile and Colette\r\nand Jacqueline. Meantime Clifford in a bland whisper was telling Rowden\r\nwhat an ass he was. Poor Rowden looked miserable until Elliott, divining\r\nhow affairs were turning, frowned on Clifford and found a moment to let\r\nRowden know that they were all going to make the best of it.\r\n\r\n"You shut up," he observed to Clifford, "it\'s fate, and that settles it."\r\n\r\n"It\'s Rowden, and that settles it," murmured Clifford, concealing a grin.\r\nFor after all he was not Hastings\' wet nurse. So it came about that the\r\ntrain which left the Gare St. Lazare at 9.15 a.m. stopped a moment in its\r\ncareer towards Havre and deposited at the red-roofed station of La Roche a\r\nmerry party, armed with sunshades, trout-rods, and one cane, carried by\r\nthe non-combatant, Hastings. Then, when they had established their camp in\r\na grove of sycamores which bordered the little river Ept, Clifford, the\r\nacknowledged master of all that pertained to sportsmanship, took command.\r\n\r\n"You, Rowden," he said, "divide your flies with Elliott and keep an eye on\r\nhim or else he\'ll be trying to put on a float and sinker. Prevent him by\r\nforce from grubbing about for worms."\r\n\r\nElliott protested, but was forced to smile in the general laugh.\r\n\r\n"You make me ill," he asserted; "do you think this is my first trout?"\r\n\r\n"I shall be delighted to see your first trout," said Clifford, and dodging\r\na fly hook, hurled with intent to hit, proceeded to sort and equip three\r\nslender rods destined to bring joy and fish to Cecil, Colette, and\r\nJacqueline. With perfect gravity he ornamented each line with four split\r\nshot, a small hook, and a brilliant quill float.\r\n\r\n"_I_ shall never touch the worms," announced Cecile with a shudder.\r\n\r\nJacqueline and Colette hastened to sustain her, and Hastings pleasantly\r\noffered to act in the capacity of general baiter and taker-off of fish.\r\nBut Cecile, doubtless fascinated by the gaudy flies in Clifford\'s book,\r\ndecided to accept lessons from him in the true art, and presently\r\ndisappeared up the Ept with Clifford in tow.\r\n\r\nElliott looked doubtfully at Colette.\r\n\r\n"I prefer gudgeons," said that damsel with decision, "and you and Monsieur\r\nRowden may go away when you please; may they not, Jacqueline?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly," responded Jacqueline.\r\n\r\nElliott, undecided, examined his rod and reel.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got your reel on wrong side up," observed Rowden.\r\n\r\nElliott wavered, and stole a glance at Colette.\r\n\r\n"I--I--have almost decided to--er--not to flip the flies about just now,"\r\nhe began. "There\'s the pole that Cecile left--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t call it a pole," corrected Rowden.\r\n\r\n"_Rod_, then," continued Elliott, and started off in the wake of the two\r\ngirls, but was promptly collared by Rowden.\r\n\r\n"No, you don\'t! Fancy a man fishing with a float and sinker when he has a\r\nfly rod in his hand! You come along!"\r\n\r\nWhere the placid little Ept flows down between its thickets to the Seine,\r\na grassy bank shadows the haunt of the gudgeon, and on this bank sat\r\nColette and Jacqueline and chattered and laughed and watched the swerving\r\nof the scarlet quills, while Hastings, his hat over his eyes, his head on\r\na bank of moss, listened to their soft voices and gallantly unhooked the\r\nsmall and indignant gudgeon when a flash of a rod and a half-suppressed\r\nscream announced a catch. The sunlight filtered through the leafy thickets\r\nawaking to song the forest birds. Magpies in spotless black and white\r\nflirted past, alighting near by with a hop and bound and twitch of the\r\ntail. Blue and white jays with rosy breasts shrieked through the trees,\r\nand a low-sailing hawk wheeled among the fields of ripening wheat, putting\r\nto flight flocks of twittering hedge birds.\r\n\r\nAcross the Seine a gull dropped on the water like a plume. The air was\r\npure and still. Scarcely a leaf moved. Sounds from a distant farm came\r\nfaintly, the shrill cock-crow and dull baying. Now and then a steam-tug\r\nwith big raking smoke-pipe, bearing the name "Guepe 27," ploughed up the\r\nriver dragging its interminable train of barges, or a sailboat dropped\r\ndown with the current toward sleepy Rouen.\r\n\r\nA faint fresh odour of earth and water hung in the air, and through the\r\nsunlight, orange-tipped butterflies danced above the marsh grass, soft\r\nvelvety butterflies flapped through the mossy woods.\r\n\r\nHastings was thinking of Valentine. It was two o\'clock when Elliott\r\nstrolled back, and frankly admitting that he had eluded Rowden, sat down\r\nbeside Colette and prepared to doze with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"Where are your trout?" said Colette severely.\r\n\r\n"They still live," murmured Elliott, and went fast asleep.\r\n\r\nRowden returned shortly after, and casting a scornful glance at the\r\nslumbering one, displayed three crimson-flecked trout.\r\n\r\n"And that," smiled Hastings lazily, "that is the holy end to which the\r\nfaithful plod,--the slaughter of these small fish with a bit of silk and\r\nfeather."\r\n\r\nRowden disdained to answer him. Colette caught another gudgeon and awoke\r\nElliott, who protested and gazed about for the lunch baskets, as Clifford\r\nand Cecile came up demanding instant refreshment. Cecile\'s skirts were\r\nsoaked, and her gloves torn, but she was happy, and Clifford, dragging out\r\na two-pound trout, stood still to receive the applause of the company.\r\n\r\n"Where the deuce did you get that?" demanded Elliott.\r\n\r\nCecile, wet and enthusiastic, recounted the battle, and then Clifford\r\neulogized her powers with the fly, and, in proof, produced from his creel\r\na defunct chub, which, he observed, just missed being a trout.\r\n\r\nThey were all very happy at luncheon, and Hastings was voted "charming."\r\nHe enjoyed it immensely,--only it seemed to him at moments that flirtation\r\nwent further in France than in Millbrook, Connecticut, and he thought that\r\nCecile might be a little less enthusiastic about Clifford, that perhaps it\r\nwould be quite as well if Jacqueline sat further away from Rowden, and\r\nthat possibly Colette could have, for a moment at least, taken her eyes\r\nfrom Elliott\'s face. Still he enjoyed it--except when his thoughts drifted\r\nto Valentine, and then he felt that he was very far away from her. La\r\nRoche is at least an hour and a half from Paris. It is also true that he\r\nfelt a happiness, a quick heart-beat when, at eight o\'clock that night the\r\ntrain which bore them from La Roche rolled into the Gare St. Lazare and he\r\nwas once more in the city of Valentine.\r\n\r\n"Good-night," they said, pressing around him. "You must come with us next\r\ntime!"\r\n\r\nHe promised, and watched them, two by two, drift into the darkening city,\r\nand stood so long that, when again he raised his eyes, the vast Boulevard\r\nwas twinkling with gas-jets through which the electric lights stared like\r\nmoons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nIt was with another quick heart-beat that he awoke next morning, for his\r\nfirst thought was of Valentine.\r\n\r\nThe sun already gilded the towers of Notre Dame, the clatter of workmen\'s\r\nsabots awoke sharp echoes in the street below, and across the way a\r\nblackbird in a pink almond tree was going into an ecstasy of trills.\r\n\r\nHe determined to awake Clifford for a brisk walk in the country, hoping\r\nlater to beguile that gentleman into the American church for his soul\'s\r\nsake. He found Alfred the gimlet-eyed washing the asphalt walk which led\r\nto the studio.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Elliott?" he replied to the perfunctory inquiry, "_je ne sais\r\npas_."\r\n\r\n"And Monsieur Clifford," began Hastings, somewhat astonished.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Clifford," said the concierge with fine irony, "will be pleased\r\nto see you, as he retired early; in fact he has just come in."\r\n\r\nHastings hesitated while the concierge pronounced a fine eulogy on people\r\nwho never stayed out all night and then came battering at the lodge gate\r\nduring hours which even a gendarme held sacred to sleep. He also\r\ndiscoursed eloquently upon the beauties of temperance, and took an\r\nostentatious draught from the fountain in the court.\r\n\r\n"I do not think I will come in," said Hastings.\r\n\r\n"Pardon, monsieur," growled the concierge, "perhaps it would be well to\r\nsee Monsieur Clifford. He possibly needs aid. Me he drives forth with\r\nhair-brushes and boots. It is a mercy if he has not set fire to something\r\nwith his candle."\r\n\r\nHastings hesitated for an instant, but swallowing his dislike of such a\r\nmission, walked slowly through the ivy-covered alley and across the inner\r\ngarden to the studio. He knocked. Perfect silence. Then he knocked again,\r\nand this time something struck the door from within with a crash.\r\n\r\n"That," said the concierge, "was a boot." He fitted his duplicate key into\r\nthe lock and ushered Hastings in. Clifford, in disordered evening dress,\r\nsat on the rug in the middle of the room. He held in his hand a shoe, and\r\ndid not appear astonished to see Hastings.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning, do you use Pears\' soap?" he inquired with a vague wave of\r\nhis hand and a vaguer smile.\r\n\r\nHastings\' heart sank. "For Heaven\'s sake," he said, "Clifford, go to bed."\r\n\r\n"Not while that--that Alfred pokes his shaggy head in here an\' I have a\r\nshoe left."\r\n\r\nHastings blew out the candle, picked up Clifford\'s hat and cane, and said,\r\nwith an emotion he could not conceal, "This is terrible,\r\nClifford,--I--never knew you did this sort of thing."\r\n\r\n"Well, I do," said Clifford.\r\n\r\n"Where is Elliott?"\r\n\r\n"Ole chap," returned Clifford, becoming maudlin, "Providence which\r\nfeeds--feeds--er--sparrows an\' that sort of thing watcheth over the\r\nintemperate wanderer--"\r\n\r\n"Where is Elliott?"\r\n\r\nBut Clifford only wagged his head and waved his arm about. "He\'s out\r\nthere,--somewhere about." Then suddenly feeling a desire to see his\r\nmissing chum, lifted up his voice and howled for him.\r\n\r\nHastings, thoroughly shocked, sat down on the lounge without a word.\r\nPresently, after shedding several scalding tears, Clifford brightened up\r\nand rose with great precaution.\r\n\r\n"Ole chap," he observed, "do you want to see er--er miracle? Well, here\r\ngoes. I\'m goin\' to begin."\r\n\r\nHe paused, beaming at vacancy.\r\n\r\n"Er miracle," he repeated.\r\n\r\nHastings supposed he was alluding to the miracle of his keeping his\r\nbalance, and said nothing.\r\n\r\n"I\'m goin\' to bed," he announced, "poor ole Clifford\'s goin\' to bed, an\'\r\nthat\'s er miracle!"\r\n\r\nAnd he did with a nice calculation of distance and equilibrium which would\r\nhave rung enthusiastic yells of applause from Elliott had he been there to\r\nassist _en connaisseur_. But he was not. He had not yet reached the\r\nstudio. He was on his way, however, and smiled with magnificent\r\ncondescension on Hastings, who, half an hour later, found him reclining\r\nupon a bench in the Luxembourg. He permitted himself to be aroused, dusted\r\nand escorted to the gate. Here, however, he refused all further\r\nassistance, and bestowing a patronizing bow upon Hastings, steered a\r\ntolerably true course for the rue Vavin.\r\n\r\nHastings watched him out of sight, and then slowly retraced his steps\r\ntoward the fountain. At first he felt gloomy and depressed, but gradually\r\nthe clear air of the morning lifted the pressure from his heart, and he\r\nsat down on the marble seat under the shadow of the winged god.\r\n\r\nThe air was fresh and sweet with perfume from the orange flowers.\r\nEverywhere pigeons were bathing, dashing the water over their iris-hued\r\nbreasts, flashing in and out of the spray or nestling almost to the neck\r\nalong the polished basin. The sparrows, too, were abroad in force, soaking\r\ntheir dust-coloured feathers in the limpid pool and chirping with might\r\nand main. Under the sycamores which surrounded the duck-pond opposite the\r\nfountain of Marie de Medici, the water-fowl cropped the herbage, or\r\nwaddled in rows down the bank to embark on some solemn aimless cruise.\r\n\r\nButterflies, somewhat lame from a chilly night\'s repose under the lilac\r\nleaves, crawled over and over the white phlox, or took a rheumatic flight\r\ntoward some sun-warmed shrub. The bees were already busy among the\r\nheliotrope, and one or two grey flies with brick-coloured eyes sat in a\r\nspot of sunlight beside the marble seat, or chased each other about, only\r\nto return again to the spot of sunshine and rub their fore-legs, exulting.\r\n\r\nThe sentries paced briskly before the painted boxes, pausing at times to\r\nlook toward the guard-house for their relief.\r\n\r\nThey came at last, with a shuffle of feet and click of bayonets, the word\r\nwas passed, the relief fell out, and away they went, crunch, crunch,\r\nacross the gravel.\r\n\r\nA mellow chime floated from the clock-tower of the palace, the deep bell\r\nof St. Sulpice echoed the stroke. Hastings sat dreaming in the shadow of\r\nthe god, and while he mused somebody came and sat down beside him. At\r\nfirst he did not raise his head. It was only when she spoke that he sprang\r\nup.\r\n\r\n"You! At this hour?"\r\n\r\n"I was restless, I could not sleep." Then in a low, happy voice--"And\r\n_you!_ at this hour?"\r\n\r\n"I--I slept, but the sun awoke me."\r\n\r\n"_I_ could not sleep," she said, and her eyes seemed, for a moment,\r\ntouched with an indefinable shadow. Then, smiling, "I am so glad--I seemed\r\nto know you were coming. Don\'t laugh, I believe in dreams."\r\n\r\n"Did you really dream of,--of my being here?"\r\n\r\n"I think I was awake when I dreamed it," she admitted. Then for a time\r\nthey were mute, acknowledging by silence the happiness of being together.\r\nAnd after all their silence was eloquent, for faint smiles, and glances\r\nborn of their thoughts, crossed and recrossed, until lips moved and words\r\nwere formed, which seemed almost superfluous. What they said was not very\r\nprofound. Perhaps the most valuable jewel that fell from Hastings\' lips\r\nbore direct reference to breakfast.\r\n\r\n"I have not yet had my chocolate," she confessed, "but what a material man\r\nyou are."\r\n\r\n"Valentine," he said impulsively, "I wish,--I do wish that you\r\nwould,--just for this once,--give me the whole day,--just for this once."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear," she smiled, "not only material, but selfish!"\r\n\r\n"Not selfish, hungry," he said, looking at her.\r\n\r\n"A cannibal too; oh dear!"\r\n\r\n"Will you, Valentine?"\r\n\r\n"But my chocolate--"\r\n\r\n"Take it with me."\r\n\r\n"But _dejeuner_--"\r\n\r\n"Together, at St. Cloud."\r\n\r\n"But I can\'t--"\r\n\r\n"Together,--all day,--all day long; will you, Valentine?"\r\n\r\nShe was silent.\r\n\r\n"Only for this once."\r\n\r\nAgain that indefinable shadow fell across her eyes, and when it was gone\r\nshe sighed. "Yes,--together, only for this once."\r\n\r\n"All day?" he said, doubting his happiness.\r\n\r\n"All day," she smiled; "and oh, I am so hungry!"\r\n\r\nHe laughed, enchanted.\r\n\r\n"What a material young lady it is."\r\n\r\nOn the Boulevard St. Michel there is a Cremerie painted white and blue\r\noutside, and neat and clean as a whistle inside. The auburn-haired young\r\nwoman who speaks French like a native, and rejoices in the name of Murphy,\r\nsmiled at them as they entered, and tossing a fresh napkin over the zinc\r\n_tete-a-tete_ table, whisked before them two cups of chocolate and a\r\nbasket full of crisp, fresh croissons.\r\n\r\nThe primrose-coloured pats of butter, each stamped with a shamrock in\r\nrelief, seemed saturated with the fragrance of Normandy pastures.\r\n\r\n"How delicious!" they said in the same breath, and then laughed at the\r\ncoincidence.\r\n\r\n"With but a single thought," he began.\r\n\r\n"How absurd!" she cried with cheeks all rosy. "I\'m thinking I\'d like a\r\ncroisson."\r\n\r\n"So am I," he replied triumphant, "that proves it."\r\n\r\nThen they had a quarrel; she accusing him of behaviour unworthy of a child\r\nin arms, and he denying it, and bringing counter charges, until\r\nMademoiselle Murphy laughed in sympathy, and the last croisson was eaten\r\nunder a flag of truce. Then they rose, and she took his arm with a bright\r\nnod to Mile. Murphy, who cried them a merry: "_Bonjour, madame! bonjour,\r\nmonsieur_!" and watched them hail a passing cab and drive away. "_Dieu!\r\nqu\'il est beau_," she sighed, adding after a moment, "Do they be married,\r\nI dunno,--_ma foi ils ont bien l\'air_."\r\n\r\nThe cab swung around the rue de Medici, turned into the rue de Vaugirard,\r\nfollowed it to where it crosses the rue de Rennes, and taking that noisy\r\nthoroughfare, drew up before the Gare Montparnasse. They were just in time\r\nfor a train and scampered up the stairway and out to the cars as the last\r\nnote from the starting-gong rang through the arched station. The guard\r\nslammed the door of their compartment, a whistle sounded, answered by a\r\nscreech from the locomotive, and the long train glided from the station,\r\nfaster, faster, and sped out into the morning sunshine. The summer wind\r\nblew in their faces from the open window, and sent the soft hair dancing\r\non the girl\'s forehead.\r\n\r\n"We have the compartment to ourselves," said Hastings.\r\n\r\nShe leaned against the cushioned window-seat, her eyes bright and wide\r\nopen, her lips parted. The wind lifted her hat, and fluttered the ribbons\r\nunder her chin. With a quick movement she untied them, and, drawing a long\r\nhat-pin from her hat, laid it down on the seat beside her. The train was\r\nflying.\r\n\r\nThe colour surged in her cheeks, and, with each quick-drawn breath, her\r\nbreath rose and fell under the cluster of lilies at her throat. Trees,\r\nhouses, ponds, danced past, cut by a mist of telegraph poles.\r\n\r\n"Faster! faster!" she cried.\r\n\r\nHis eyes never left her, but hers, wide open, and blue as the summer sky,\r\nseemed fixed on something far ahead,--something which came no nearer, but\r\nfled before them as they fled.\r\n\r\nWas it the horizon, cut now by the grim fortress on the hill, now by the\r\ncross of a country chapel? Was it the summer moon, ghost-like, slipping\r\nthrough the vaguer blue above?\r\n\r\n"Faster! faster!" she cried.\r\n\r\nHer parted lips burned scarlet.\r\n\r\nThe car shook and shivered, and the fields streamed by like an emerald\r\ntorrent. He caught the excitement, and his faced glowed.\r\n\r\n"Oh," she cried, and with an unconscious movement caught his hand, drawing\r\nhim to the window beside her. "Look! lean out with me!"\r\n\r\nHe only saw her lips move; her voice was drowned in the roar of a trestle,\r\nbut his hand closed in hers and he clung to the sill. The wind whistled in\r\ntheir ears. "Not so far out, Valentine, take care!" he gasped.\r\n\r\nBelow, through the ties of the trestle, a broad river flashed into view\r\nand out again, as the train thundered along a tunnel, and away once more\r\nthrough the freshest of green fields. The wind roared about them. The girl\r\nwas leaning far out from the window, and he caught her by the waist,\r\ncrying, "Not too far!" but she only murmured, "Faster! faster! away out of\r\nthe city, out of the land, faster, faster! away out of the world!"\r\n\r\n"What are you saying all to yourself?" he said, but his voice was broken,\r\nand the wind whirled it back into his throat.\r\n\r\nShe heard him, and, turning from the window looked down at his arm about\r\nher. Then she raised her eyes to his. The car shook and the windows\r\nrattled. They were dashing through a forest now, and the sun swept the\r\ndewy branches with running flashes of fire. He looked into her troubled\r\neyes; he drew her to him and kissed the half-parted lips, and she cried\r\nout, a bitter, hopeless cry, "Not that--not that!"\r\n\r\nBut he held her close and strong, whispering words of honest love and\r\npassion, and when she sobbed--"Not that--not that--I have promised! You\r\nmust--you must know--I am--not--worthy--" In the purity of his own heart\r\nher words were, to him, meaningless then, meaningless for ever after.\r\nPresently her voice ceased, and her head rested on his breast. He leaned\r\nagainst the window, his ears swept by the furious wind, his heart in a\r\njoyous tumult. The forest was passed, and the sun slipped from behind the\r\ntrees, flooding the earth again with brightness. She raised her eyes and\r\nlooked out into the world from the window. Then she began to speak, but\r\nher voice was faint, and he bent his head close to hers and listened. "I\r\ncannot turn from you; I am too weak. You were long ago my master--master\r\nof my heart and soul. I have broken my word to one who trusted me, but I\r\nhave told you all;--what matters the rest?" He smiled at her innocence and\r\nshe worshipped his. She spoke again: "Take me or cast me away;--what\r\nmatters it? Now with a word you can kill me, and it might be easier to die\r\nthan to look upon happiness as great as mine."\r\n\r\nHe took her in his arms, "Hush, what are you saying? Look,--look out at\r\nthe sunlight, the meadows and the streams. We shall be very happy in so\r\nbright a world."\r\n\r\nShe turned to the sunlight. From the window, the world below seemed very\r\nfair to her.\r\n\r\nTrembling with happiness, she sighed: "Is this the world? Then I have\r\nnever known it."\r\n\r\n"Nor have I, God forgive me," he murmured.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was our gentle Lady of the Fields who forgave them both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUE BARREE\r\n\r\n  "For let Philosopher and Doctor preach\r\n  Of what they will and what they will not,--each\r\n  Is but one link in an eternal chain\r\n  That none can slip nor break nor over-reach."\r\n\r\n  "Crimson nor yellow roses nor\r\n  The savour of the mounting sea\r\n  Are worth the perfume I adore\r\n  That clings to thee.\r\n  The languid-headed lilies tire,\r\n  The changeless waters weary me;\r\n  I ache with passionate desire\r\n  Of thine and thee.\r\n  There are but these things in the world--\r\n  Thy mouth of fire,\r\n  Thy breasts, thy hands, thy hair upcurled\r\n  And my desire."\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nOne morning at Julian\'s, a student said to Selby, "That is Foxhall\r\nClifford," pointing with his brushes at a young man who sat before an\r\neasel, doing nothing.\r\n\r\nSelby, shy and nervous, walked over and began: "My name is Selby,--I have\r\njust arrived in Paris, and bring a letter of introduction--" His voice was\r\nlost in the crash of a falling easel, the owner of which promptly\r\nassaulted his neighbour, and for a time the noise of battle rolled through\r\nthe studios of MM. Boulanger and Lefebvre, presently subsiding into a\r\nscuffle on the stairs outside. Selby, apprehensive as to his own reception\r\nin the studio, looked at Clifford, who sat serenely watching the fight.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a little noisy here," said Clifford, "but you will like the fellows\r\nwhen you know them." His unaffected manner delighted Selby. Then with a\r\nsimplicity that won his heart, he presented him to half a dozen students\r\nof as many nationalities. Some were cordial, all were polite. Even the\r\nmajestic creature who held the position of Massier, unbent enough to say:\r\n"My friend, when a man speaks French as well as you do, and is also a\r\nfriend of Monsieur Clifford, he will have no trouble in this studio. You\r\nexpect, of course, to fill the stove until the next new man comes?"\r\n\r\n"Of course."\r\n\r\n"And you don\'t mind chaff?"\r\n\r\n"No," replied Selby, who hated it.\r\n\r\nClifford, much amused, put on his hat, saying, "You must expect lots of it\r\nat first."\r\n\r\nSelby placed his own hat on his head and followed him to the door.\r\n\r\nAs they passed the model stand there was a furious cry of "Chapeau!\r\nChapeau!" and a student sprang from his easel menacing Selby, who reddened\r\nbut looked at Clifford.\r\n\r\n"Take off your hat for them," said the latter, laughing.\r\n\r\nA little embarrassed, he turned and saluted the studio.\r\n\r\n"Et moi?" cried the model.\r\n\r\n"You are charming," replied Selby, astonished at his own audacity, but the\r\nstudio rose as one man, shouting: "He has done well! he\'s all right!"\r\nwhile the model, laughing, kissed her hand to him and cried: "A demain\r\nbeau jeune homme!"\r\n\r\nAll that week Selby worked at the studio unmolested. The French students\r\nchristened him "l\'Enfant Prodigue," which was freely translated, "The\r\nProdigious Infant," "The Kid," "Kid Selby," and "Kidby." But the disease\r\nsoon ran its course from "Kidby" to "Kidney," and then naturally to\r\n"Tidbits," where it was arrested by Clifford\'s authority and ultimately\r\nrelapsed to "Kid."\r\n\r\nWednesday came, and with it M. Boulanger. For three hours the students\r\nwrithed under his biting sarcasms,--among the others Clifford, who was\r\ninformed that he knew even less about a work of art than he did about the\r\nart of work. Selby was more fortunate. The professor examined his drawing\r\nin silence, looked at him sharply, and passed on with a non-committal\r\ngesture. He presently departed arm in arm with Bouguereau, to the relief\r\nof Clifford, who was then at liberty to jam his hat on his head and\r\ndepart.\r\n\r\nThe next day he did not appear, and Selby, who had counted on seeing him\r\nat the studio, a thing which he learned later it was vanity to count on,\r\nwandered back to the Latin Quarter alone.\r\n\r\nParis was still strange and new to him. He was vaguely troubled by its\r\nsplendour. No tender memories stirred his American bosom at the Place du\r\nChatelet, nor even by Notre Dame. The Palais de Justice with its clock and\r\nturrets and stalking sentinels in blue and vermilion, the Place St. Michel\r\nwith its jumble of omnibuses and ugly water-spitting griffins, the hill of\r\nthe Boulevard St. Michel, the tooting trams, the policemen dawdling two by\r\ntwo, and the table-lined terraces of the Cafe Vacehett were nothing to\r\nhim, as yet, nor did he even know, when he stepped from the stones of the\r\nPlace St. Michel to the asphalt of the Boulevard, that he had crossed the\r\nfrontier and entered the student zone,--the famous Latin Quarter.\r\n\r\nA cabman hailed him as "bourgeois," and urged the superiority of driving\r\nover walking. A gamin, with an appearance of great concern, requested the\r\nlatest telegraphic news from London, and then, standing on his head,\r\ninvited Selby to feats of strength. A pretty girl gave him a glance from a\r\npair of violet eyes. He did not see her, but she, catching her own\r\nreflection in a window, wondered at the colour burning in her cheeks.\r\nTurning to resume her course, she met Foxhall Clifford, and hurried on.\r\nClifford, open-mouthed, followed her with his eyes; then he looked after\r\nSelby, who had turned into the Boulevard St. Germain toward the rue de\r\nSeine. Then he examined himself in the shop window. The result seemed to\r\nbe unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not a beauty," he mused, "but neither am I a hobgoblin. What does she\r\nmean by blushing at Selby? I never before saw her look at a fellow in my\r\nlife,--neither has any one in the Quarter. Anyway, I can swear she never\r\nlooks at me, and goodness knows I have done all that respectful adoration\r\ncan do."\r\n\r\nHe sighed, and murmuring a prophecy concerning the salvation of his\r\nimmortal soul swung into that graceful lounge which at all times\r\ncharacterized Clifford. With no apparent exertion, he overtook Selby at\r\nthe corner, and together they crossed the sunlit Boulevard and sat down\r\nunder the awning of the Cafe du Cercle. Clifford bowed to everybody on the\r\nterrace, saying, "You shall meet them all later, but now let me present\r\nyou to two of the sights of Paris, Mr. Richard Elliott and Mr. Stanley\r\nRowden."\r\n\r\nThe "sights" looked amiable, and took vermouth.\r\n\r\n"You cut the studio to-day," said Elliott, suddenly turning on Clifford,\r\nwho avoided his eyes.\r\n\r\n"To commune with nature?" observed Rowden.\r\n\r\n"What\'s her name this time?" asked Elliott, and Rowden answered promptly,\r\n"Name, Yvette; nationality, Breton--"\r\n\r\n"Wrong," replied Clifford blandly, "it\'s Rue Barree."\r\n\r\nThe subject changed instantly, and Selby listened in surprise to names\r\nwhich were new to him, and eulogies on the latest Prix de Rome winner. He\r\nwas delighted to hear opinions boldly expressed and points honestly\r\ndebated, although the vehicle was mostly slang, both English and French.\r\nHe longed for the time when he too should be plunged into the strife for\r\nfame.\r\n\r\nThe bells of St. Sulpice struck the hour, and the Palace of the Luxembourg\r\nanswered chime on chime. With a glance at the sun, dipping low in the\r\ngolden dust behind the Palais Bourbon, they rose, and turning to the east,\r\ncrossed the Boulevard St. Germain and sauntered toward the Ecole de\r\nMedecine. At the corner a girl passed them, walking hurriedly. Clifford\r\nsmirked, Elliot and Rowden were agitated, but they all bowed, and, without\r\nraising her eyes, she returned their salute. But Selby, who had lagged\r\nbehind, fascinated by some gay shop window, looked up to meet two of the\r\nbluest eyes he had ever seen. The eyes were dropped in an instant, and the\r\nyoung fellow hastened to overtake the others.\r\n\r\n"By Jove," he said, "do you fellows know I have just seen the prettiest\r\ngirl--" An exclamation broke from the trio, gloomy, foreboding, like the\r\nchorus in a Greek play.\r\n\r\n"Rue Barree!"\r\n\r\n"What!" cried Selby, bewildered.\r\n\r\nThe only answer was a vague gesture from Clifford.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later, during dinner, Clifford turned to Selby and said, "You\r\nwant to ask me something; I can tell by the way you fidget about."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do," he said, innocently enough; "it\'s about that girl. Who is\r\nshe?"\r\n\r\nIn Rowden\'s smile there was pity, in Elliott\'s bitterness.\r\n\r\n"Her name," said Clifford solemnly, "is unknown to any one, at least," he\r\nadded with much conscientiousness, "as far as I can learn. Every fellow in\r\nthe Quarter bows to her and she returns the salute gravely, but no man has\r\never been known to obtain more than that. Her profession, judging from her\r\nmusic-roll, is that of a pianist. Her residence is in a small and humble\r\nstreet which is kept in a perpetual process of repair by the city\r\nauthorities, and from the black letters painted on the barrier which\r\ndefends the street from traffic, she has taken the name by which we know\r\nher,--Rue Barree. Mr. Rowden, in his imperfect knowledge of the French\r\ntongue, called our attention to it as Roo Barry--"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t," said Rowden hotly.\r\n\r\n"And Roo Barry, or Rue Barree, is to-day an object of adoration to every\r\nrapin in the Quarter--"\r\n\r\n"We are not rapins," corrected Elliott.\r\n\r\n"_I_ am not," returned Clifford, "and I beg to call to your attention,\r\nSelby, that these two gentlemen have at various and apparently unfortunate\r\nmoments, offered to lay down life and limb at the feet of Rue Barree. The\r\nlady possesses a chilling smile which she uses on such occasions and,"\r\nhere he became gloomily impressive, "I have been forced to believe that\r\nneither the scholarly grace of my friend Elliott nor the buxom beauty of\r\nmy friend Rowden have touched that heart of ice."\r\n\r\nElliott and Rowden, boiling with indignation, cried out, "And you!"\r\n\r\n"I," said Clifford blandly, "do fear to tread where you rush in."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTwenty-four hours later Selby had completely forgotten Rue Barree. During\r\nthe week he worked with might and main at the studio, and Saturday night\r\nfound him so tired that he went to bed before dinner and had a nightmare\r\nabout a river of yellow ochre in which he was drowning. Sunday morning,\r\napropos of nothing at all, he thought of Rue Barree, and ten seconds\r\nafterwards he saw her. It was at the flower-market on the marble bridge.\r\nShe was examining a pot of pansies. The gardener had evidently thrown\r\nheart and soul into the transaction, but Rue Barree shook her head.\r\n\r\nIt is a question whether Selby would have stopped then and there to\r\ninspect a cabbage-rose had not Clifford unwound for him the yarn of the\r\nprevious Tuesday. It is possible that his curiosity was piqued, for with\r\nthe exception of a hen-turkey, a boy of nineteen is the most openly\r\ncurious biped alive. From twenty until death he tries to conceal it. But,\r\nto be fair to Selby, it is also true that the market was attractive. Under\r\na cloudless sky the flowers were packed and heaped along the marble bridge\r\nto the parapet. The air was soft, the sun spun a shadowy lacework among\r\nthe palms and glowed in the hearts of a thousand roses. Spring had\r\ncome,--was in full tide. The watering carts and sprinklers spread\r\nfreshness over the Boulevard, the sparrows had become vulgarly obtrusive,\r\nand the credulous Seine angler anxiously followed his gaudy quill floating\r\namong the soapsuds of the lavoirs. The white-spiked chestnuts clad in\r\ntender green vibrated with the hum of bees. Shoddy butterflies flaunted\r\ntheir winter rags among the heliotrope. There was a smell of fresh earth\r\nin the air, an echo of the woodland brook in the ripple of the Seine, and\r\nswallows soared and skimmed among the anchored river craft. Somewhere in a\r\nwindow a caged bird was singing its heart out to the sky.\r\n\r\nSelby looked at the cabbage-rose and then at the sky. Something in the\r\nsong of the caged bird may have moved him, or perhaps it was that\r\ndangerous sweetness in the air of May.\r\n\r\nAt first he was hardly conscious that he had stopped then he was scarcely\r\nconscious why he had stopped, then he thought he would move on, then he\r\nthought he wouldn\'t, then he looked at Rue Barree.\r\n\r\nThe gardener said, "Mademoiselle, this is undoubtedly a fine pot of\r\npansies."\r\n\r\nRue Barree shook her head.\r\n\r\nThe gardener smiled. She evidently did not want the pansies. She had\r\nbought many pots of pansies there, two or three every spring, and never\r\nargued. What did she want then? The pansies were evidently a feeler toward\r\na more important transaction. The gardener rubbed his hands and gazed\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\n"These tulips are magnificent," he observed, "and these hyacinths--" He\r\nfell into a trance at the mere sight of the scented thickets.\r\n\r\n"That," murmured Rue, pointing to a splendid rose-bush with her furled\r\nparasol, but in spite of her, her voice trembled a little. Selby noticed\r\nit, more shame to him that he was listening, and the gardener noticed it,\r\nand, burying his nose in the roses, scented a bargain. Still, to do him\r\njustice, he did not add a centime to the honest value of the plant, for\r\nafter all, Rue was probably poor, and any one could see she was charming.\r\n\r\n"Fifty francs, Mademoiselle."\r\n\r\nThe gardener\'s tone was grave. Rue felt that argument would be wasted.\r\nThey both stood silent for a moment. The gardener did not eulogize his\r\nprize,--the rose-tree was gorgeous and any one could see it.\r\n\r\n"I will take the pansies," said the girl, and drew two francs from a worn\r\npurse. Then she looked up. A tear-drop stood in the way refracting the\r\nlight like a diamond, but as it rolled into a little corner by her nose a\r\nvision of Selby replaced it, and when a brush of the handkerchief had\r\ncleared the startled blue eyes, Selby himself appeared, very much\r\nembarrassed. He instantly looked up into the sky, apparently devoured with\r\na thirst for astronomical research, and as he continued his investigations\r\nfor fully five minutes, the gardener looked up too, and so did a\r\npoliceman. Then Selby looked at the tips of his boots, the gardener looked\r\nat him and the policeman slouched on. Rue Barree had been gone some time.\r\n\r\n"What," said the gardener, "may I offer Monsieur?"\r\n\r\nSelby never knew why, but he suddenly began to buy flowers. The gardener\r\nwas electrified. Never before had he sold so many flowers, never at such\r\nsatisfying prices, and never, never with such absolute unanimity of\r\nopinion with a customer. But he missed the bargaining, the arguing, the\r\ncalling of Heaven to witness. The transaction lacked spice.\r\n\r\n"These tulips are magnificent!"\r\n\r\n"They are!" cried Selby warmly.\r\n\r\n"But alas, they are dear."\r\n\r\n"I will take them."\r\n\r\n"Dieu!" murmured the gardener in a perspiration, "he\'s madder than most\r\nEnglishmen."\r\n\r\n"This cactus--"\r\n\r\n"Is gorgeous!"\r\n\r\n"Alas--"\r\n\r\n"Send it with the rest."\r\n\r\nThe gardener braced himself against the river wall.\r\n\r\n"That splendid rose-bush," he began faintly.\r\n\r\n"That is a beauty. I believe it is fifty francs--"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, very red. The gardener relished his confusion. Then a sudden\r\ncool self-possession took the place of his momentary confusion and he held\r\nthe gardener with his eye, and bullied him.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take that bush. Why did not the young lady buy it?"\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle is not wealthy."\r\n\r\n"How do you know?"\r\n\r\n"_Dame_, I sell her many pansies; pansies are not expensive."\r\n\r\n"Those are the pansies she bought?"\r\n\r\n"These, Monsieur, the blue and gold."\r\n\r\n"Then you intend to send them to her?"\r\n\r\n"At mid-day after the market."\r\n\r\n"Take this rose-bush with them, and"--here he glared at the\r\ngardener--"don\'t you dare say from whom they came." The gardener\'s eyes\r\nwere like saucers, but Selby, calm and victorious, said: "Send the others\r\nto the Hotel du Senat, 7 rue de Tournon. I will leave directions with the\r\nconcierge."\r\n\r\nThen he buttoned his glove with much dignity and stalked off, but when\r\nwell around the corner and hidden from the gardener\'s view, the conviction\r\nthat he was an idiot came home to him in a furious blush. Ten minutes\r\nlater he sat in his room in the Hotel du Senat repeating with an imbecile\r\nsmile: "What an ass I am, what an ass!"\r\n\r\nAn hour later found him in the same chair, in the same position, his hat\r\nand gloves still on, his stick in his hand, but he was silent, apparently\r\nlost in contemplation of his boot toes, and his smile was less imbecile\r\nand even a bit retrospective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAbout five o\'clock that afternoon, the little sad-eyed woman who fills the\r\nposition of concierge at the Hotel du Senat held up her hands in amazement\r\nto see a wagon-load of flower-bearing shrubs draw up before the doorway.\r\nShe called Joseph, the intemperate garcon, who, while calculating the\r\nvalue of the flowers in _petits verres_, gloomily disclaimed any knowledge\r\nas to their destination.\r\n\r\n"_Voyons_," said the little concierge, "_cherchons la femme_!"\r\n\r\n"You?" he suggested.\r\n\r\nThe little woman stood a moment pensive and then sighed. Joseph caressed\r\nhis nose, a nose which for gaudiness could vie with any floral display.\r\n\r\nThen the gardener came in, hat in hand, and a few minutes later Selby\r\nstood in the middle of his room, his coat off, his shirt-sleeves rolled\r\nup. The chamber originally contained, besides the furniture, about two\r\nsquare feet of walking room, and now this was occupied by a cactus. The\r\nbed groaned under crates of pansies, lilies and heliotrope, the lounge was\r\ncovered with hyacinths and tulips, and the washstand supported a species\r\nof young tree warranted to bear flowers at some time or other.\r\n\r\nClifford came in a little later, fell over a box of sweet peas, swore a\r\nlittle, apologized, and then, as the full splendour of the floral _fete_\r\nburst upon him, sat down in astonishment upon a geranium. The geranium was\r\na wreck, but Selby said, "Don\'t mind," and glared at the cactus.\r\n\r\n"Are you going to give a ball?" demanded Clifford.\r\n\r\n"N--no,--I\'m very fond of flowers," said Selby, but the statement lacked\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\n"I should imagine so." Then, after a silence, "That\'s a fine cactus."\r\n\r\nSelby contemplated the cactus, touched it with the air of a connoisseur,\r\nand pricked his thumb.\r\n\r\nClifford poked a pansy with his stick. Then Joseph came in with the bill,\r\nannouncing the sum total in a loud voice, partly to impress Clifford,\r\npartly to intimidate Selby into disgorging a _pourboire_ which he would\r\nshare, if he chose, with the gardener. Clifford tried to pretend that he\r\nhad not heard, while Selby paid bill and tribute without a murmur. Then he\r\nlounged back into the room with an attempt at indifference which failed\r\nentirely when he tore his trousers on the cactus.\r\n\r\nClifford made some commonplace remark, lighted a cigarette and looked out\r\nof the window to give Selby a chance. Selby tried to take it, but getting\r\nas far as--"Yes, spring is here at last," froze solid. He looked at the\r\nback of Clifford\'s head. It expressed volumes. Those little perked-up ears\r\nseemed tingling with suppressed glee. He made a desperate effort to master\r\nthe situation, and jumped up to reach for some Russian cigarettes as an\r\nincentive to conversation, but was foiled by the cactus, to whom again he\r\nfell a prey. The last straw was added.\r\n\r\n"Damn the cactus." This observation was wrung from Selby against his\r\nwill,--against his own instinct of self-preservation, but the thorns on\r\nthe cactus were long and sharp, and at their repeated prick his pent-up\r\nwrath escaped. It was too late now; it was done, and Clifford had wheeled\r\naround.\r\n\r\n"See here, Selby, why the deuce did you buy those flowers?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m fond of them," said Selby.\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do with them? You can\'t sleep here."\r\n\r\n"I could, if you\'d help me take the pansies off the bed."\r\n\r\n"Where can you put them?"\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t I give them to the concierge?"\r\n\r\nAs soon as he said it he regretted it. What in Heaven\'s name would\r\nClifford think of him! He had heard the amount of the bill. Would he\r\nbelieve that he had invested in these luxuries as a timid declaration to\r\nhis concierge? And would the Latin Quarter comment upon it in their own\r\nbrutal fashion? He dreaded ridicule and he knew Clifford\'s reputation.\r\n\r\nThen somebody knocked.\r\n\r\nSelby looked at Clifford with a hunted expression which touched that young\r\nman\'s heart. It was a confession and at the same time a supplication.\r\nClifford jumped up, threaded his way through the floral labyrinth, and\r\nputting an eye to the crack of the door, said, "Who the devil is it?"\r\n\r\nThis graceful style of reception is indigenous to the Quarter.\r\n\r\n"It\'s Elliott," he said, looking back, "and Rowden too, and their\r\nbulldogs." Then he addressed them through the crack.\r\n\r\n"Sit down on the stairs; Selby and I are coming out directly."\r\n\r\nDiscretion is a virtue. The Latin Quarter possesses few, and discretion\r\nseldom figures on the list. They sat down and began to whistle.\r\n\r\nPresently Rowden called out, "I smell flowers. They feast within!"\r\n\r\n"You ought to know Selby better than that," growled Clifford behind the\r\ndoor, while the other hurriedly exchanged his torn trousers for others.\r\n\r\n"_We_ know Selby," said Elliott with emphasis.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Rowden, "he gives receptions with floral decorations and\r\ninvites Clifford, while we sit on the stairs."\r\n\r\n"Yes, while the youth and beauty of the Quarter revel," suggested Rowden;\r\nthen, with sudden misgiving; "Is Odette there?"\r\n\r\n"See here," demanded Elliott, "is Colette there?"\r\n\r\nThen he raised his voice in a plaintive howl, "Are you there, Colette,\r\nwhile I\'m kicking my heels on these tiles?"\r\n\r\n"Clifford is capable of anything," said Rowden; "his nature is soured\r\nsince Rue Barree sat on him."\r\n\r\nElliott raised his voice: "I say, you fellows, we saw some flowers carried\r\ninto Rue Barree\'s house at noon."\r\n\r\n"Posies and roses," specified Rowden.\r\n\r\n"Probably for her," added Elliott, caressing his bulldog.\r\n\r\nClifford turned with sudden suspicion upon Selby. The latter hummed a\r\ntune, selected a pair of gloves and, choosing a dozen cigarettes, placed\r\nthem in a case. Then walking over to the cactus, he deliberately detached\r\na blossom, drew it through his buttonhole, and picking up hat and stick,\r\nsmiled upon Clifford, at which the latter was mightily troubled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nMonday morning at Julian\'s, students fought for places; students with\r\nprior claims drove away others who had been anxiously squatting on coveted\r\ntabourets since the door was opened in hopes of appropriating them at\r\nroll-call; students squabbled over palettes, brushes, portfolios, or rent\r\nthe air with demands for Ciceri and bread. The former, a dirty ex-model,\r\nwho had in palmier days posed as Judas, now dispensed stale bread at one\r\nsou and made enough to keep himself in cigarettes. Monsieur Julian walked\r\nin, smiled a fatherly smile and walked out. His disappearance was followed\r\nby the apparition of the clerk, a foxy creature who flitted through the\r\nbattling hordes in search of prey.\r\n\r\nThree men who had not paid dues were caught and summoned. A fourth was\r\nscented, followed, outflanked, his retreat towards the door cut off, and\r\nfinally captured behind the stove. About that time, the revolution\r\nassuming an acute form, howls rose for "Jules!"\r\n\r\nJules came, umpired two fights with a sad resignation in his big brown\r\neyes, shook hands with everybody and melted away in the throng, leaving an\r\natmosphere of peace and good-will. The lions sat down with the lambs, the\r\nmassiers marked the best places for themselves and friends, and, mounting\r\nthe model stands, opened the roll-calls.\r\n\r\nThe word was passed, "They begin with C this week."\r\n\r\nThey did.\r\n\r\n"Clisson!"\r\n\r\nClisson jumped like a flash and marked his name on the floor in chalk\r\nbefore a front seat.\r\n\r\n"Caron!"\r\n\r\nCaron galloped away to secure his place. Bang! went an easel. "_Nom de\r\nDieu_!" in French,--"Where in h--l are you goin\'!" in English. Crash! a\r\npaintbox fell with brushes and all on board. "_Dieu de Dieu de_--" spat! A\r\nblow, a short rush, a clinch and scuffle, and the voice of the massier,\r\nstern and reproachful:\r\n\r\n"Cochon!"\r\n\r\nThen the roll-call was resumed.\r\n\r\n"Clifford!"\r\n\r\nThe massier paused and looked up, one finger between the leaves of the\r\nledger.\r\n\r\n"Clifford!"\r\n\r\nClifford was not there. He was about three miles away in a direct line and\r\nevery instant increased the distance. Not that he was walking fast,--on\r\nthe contrary, he was strolling with that leisurely gait peculiar to\r\nhimself. Elliott was beside him and two bulldogs covered the rear. Elliott\r\nwas reading the "Gil Blas," from which he seemed to extract amusement, but\r\ndeeming boisterous mirth unsuitable to Clifford\'s state of mind, subdued\r\nhis amusement to a series of discreet smiles. The latter, moodily aware of\r\nthis, said nothing, but leading the way into the Luxembourg Gardens\r\ninstalled himself upon a bench by the northern terrace and surveyed the\r\nlandscape with disfavour. Elliott, according to the Luxembourg\r\nregulations, tied the two dogs and then, with an interrogative glance\r\ntoward his friend, resumed the "Gil Blas" and the discreet smiles.\r\n\r\nThe day was perfect. The sun hung over Notre Dame, setting the city in a\r\nglitter. The tender foliage of the chestnuts cast a shadow over the\r\nterrace and flecked the paths and walks with tracery so blue that Clifford\r\nmight here have found encouragement for his violent "impressions" had he\r\nbut looked; but as usual in this period of his career, his thoughts were\r\nanywhere except in his profession. Around about, the sparrows quarrelled\r\nand chattered their courtship songs, the big rosy pigeons sailed from tree\r\nto tree, the flies whirled in the sunbeams and the flowers exhaled a\r\nthousand perfumes which stirred Clifford with languorous wistfulness.\r\nUnder this influence he spoke.\r\n\r\n"Elliott, you are a true friend--"\r\n\r\n"You make me ill," replied the latter, folding his paper. "It\'s just as I\r\nthought,--you are tagging after some new petticoat again. And," he\r\ncontinued wrathfully, "if this is what you\'ve kept me away from Julian\'s\r\nfor,--if it\'s to fill me up with the perfections of some little idiot--"\r\n\r\n"Not idiot," remonstrated Clifford gently.\r\n\r\n"See here," cried Elliott, "have you the nerve to try to tell me that you\r\nare in love again?"\r\n\r\n"Again?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, again and again and again and--by George have you?"\r\n\r\n"This," observed Clifford sadly, "is serious."\r\n\r\nFor a moment Elliott would have laid hands on him, then he laughed from\r\nsheer helplessness. "Oh, go on, go on; let\'s see, there\'s Clemence and\r\nMarie Tellec and Cosette and Fifine, Colette, Marie Verdier--"\r\n\r\n"All of whom are charming, most charming, but I never was serious--"\r\n\r\n"So help me, Moses," said Elliott, solemnly, "each and every one of those\r\nnamed have separately and in turn torn your heart with anguish and have\r\nalso made me lose my place at Julian\'s in this same manner; each and every\r\none, separately and in turn. Do you deny it?"\r\n\r\n"What you say may be founded on facts--in a way--but give me the credit of\r\nbeing faithful to one at a time--"\r\n\r\n"Until the next came along."\r\n\r\n"But this,--this is really very different. Elliott, believe me, I am all\r\nbroken up."\r\n\r\nThen there being nothing else to do, Elliott gnashed his teeth and\r\nlistened.\r\n\r\n"It\'s--it\'s Rue Barree."\r\n\r\n"Well," observed Elliott, with scorn, "if you are moping and moaning over\r\n_that_ girl,--the girl who has given you and myself every reason to wish\r\nthat the ground would open and engulf us,--well, go on!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m going on,--I don\'t care; timidity has fled--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, your native timidity."\r\n\r\n"I\'m desperate, Elliott. Am I in love? Never, never did I feel so d--n\r\nmiserable. I can\'t sleep; honestly, I\'m incapable of eating properly."\r\n\r\n"Same symptoms noticed in the case of Colette."\r\n\r\n"Listen, will you?"\r\n\r\n"Hold on a moment, I know the rest by heart. Now let me ask you something.\r\nIs it your belief that Rue Barree is a pure girl?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Clifford, turning red.\r\n\r\n"Do you love her,--not as you dangle and tiptoe after every pretty\r\ninanity--I mean, do you honestly love her?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the other doggedly, "I would--"\r\n\r\n"Hold on a moment; would you marry her?"\r\n\r\nClifford turned scarlet. "Yes," he muttered.\r\n\r\n"Pleasant news for your family," growled Elliott in suppressed fury.\r\n"\'Dear father, I have just married a charming grisette whom I\'m sure\r\nyou\'ll welcome with open arms, in company with her mother, a most\r\nestimable and cleanly washlady.\' Good heavens! This seems to have gone a\r\nlittle further than the rest. Thank your stars, young man, that my head is\r\nlevel enough for us both. Still, in this case, I have no fear. Rue Barree\r\nsat on your aspirations in a manner unmistakably final."\r\n\r\n"Rue Barree," began Clifford, drawing himself up, but he suddenly ceased,\r\nfor there where the dappled sunlight glowed in spots of gold, along the\r\nsun-flecked path, tripped Rue Barree. Her gown was spotless, and her big\r\nstraw hat, tipped a little from the white forehead, threw a shadow across\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\nElliott stood up and bowed. Clifford removed his head-covering with an air\r\nso plaintive, so appealing, so utterly humble that Rue Barree smiled.\r\n\r\nThe smile was delicious and when Clifford, incapable of sustaining himself\r\non his legs from sheer astonishment, toppled slightly, she smiled again in\r\nspite of herself. A few moments later she took a chair on the terrace and\r\ndrawing a book from her music-roll, turned the pages, found the place, and\r\nthen placing it open downwards in her lap, sighed a little, smiled a\r\nlittle, and looked out over the city. She had entirely forgotten Foxhall\r\nClifford.\r\n\r\nAfter a while she took up her book again, but instead of reading began to\r\nadjust a rose in her corsage. The rose was big and red. It glowed like\r\nfire there over her heart, and like fire it warmed her heart, now\r\nfluttering under the silken petals. Rue Barree sighed again. She was very\r\nhappy. The sky was so blue, the air so soft and perfumed, the sunshine so\r\ncaressing, and her heart sang within her, sang to the rose in her breast.\r\nThis is what it sang: "Out of the throng of passers-by, out of the world\r\nof yesterday, out of the millions passing, one has turned aside to me."\r\n\r\nSo her heart sang under his rose on her breast. Then two big\r\nmouse-coloured pigeons came whistling by and alighted on the terrace,\r\nwhere they bowed and strutted and bobbed and turned until Rue Barree\r\nlaughed in delight, and looking up beheld Clifford before her. His hat was\r\nin his hand and his face was wreathed in a series of appealing smiles\r\nwhich would have touched the heart of a Bengal tiger.\r\n\r\nFor an instant Rue Barree frowned, then she looked curiously at Clifford,\r\nthen when she saw the resemblance between his bows and the bobbing\r\npigeons, in spite of herself, her lips parted in the most bewitching\r\nlaugh. Was this Rue Barree? So changed, so changed that she did not know\r\nherself; but oh! that song in her heart which drowned all else, which\r\ntrembled on her lips, struggling for utterance, which rippled forth in a\r\nlaugh at nothing,--at a strutting pigeon,--and Mr. Clifford.\r\n\r\n"And you think, because I return the salute of the students in the\r\nQuarter, that you may be received in particular as a friend? I do not know\r\nyou, Monsieur, but vanity is man\'s other name;--be content, Monsieur\r\nVanity, I shall be punctilious--oh, most punctilious in returning your\r\nsalute."\r\n\r\n"But I beg--I implore you to let me render you that homage which has so\r\nlong--"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear; I don\'t care for homage."\r\n\r\n"Let me only be permitted to speak to you now and then,--occasionally--very\r\noccasionally."\r\n\r\n"And if _you_, why not another?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all,--I will be discretion itself."\r\n\r\n"Discretion--why?"\r\n\r\nHer eyes were very clear, and Clifford winced for a moment, but only for a\r\nmoment. Then the devil of recklessness seizing him, he sat down and\r\noffered himself, soul and body, goods and chattels. And all the time he\r\nknew he was a fool and that infatuation is not love, and that each word he\r\nuttered bound him in honour from which there was no escape. And all the\r\ntime Elliott was scowling down on the fountain plaza and savagely checking\r\nboth bulldogs from their desire to rush to Clifford\'s rescue,--for even\r\nthey felt there was something wrong, as Elliott stormed within himself and\r\ngrowled maledictions.\r\n\r\nWhen Clifford finished, he finished in a glow of excitement, but Rue\r\nBarree\'s response was long in coming and his ardour cooled while the\r\nsituation slowly assumed its just proportions. Then regret began to creep\r\nin, but he put that aside and broke out again in protestations. At the\r\nfirst word Rue Barree checked him.\r\n\r\n"I thank you," she said, speaking very gravely. "No man has ever before\r\noffered me marriage." She turned and looked out over the city. After a\r\nwhile she spoke again. "You offer me a great deal. I am alone, I have\r\nnothing, I am nothing." She turned again and looked at Paris, brilliant,\r\nfair, in the sunshine of a perfect day. He followed her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Oh," she murmured, "it is hard,--hard to work always--always alone with\r\nnever a friend you can have in honour, and the love that is offered means\r\nthe streets, the boulevard--when passion is dead. I know it,--_we_ know\r\nit,--we others who have nothing,--have no one, and who give ourselves,\r\nunquestioning--when we love,--yes, unquestioning--heart and soul, knowing\r\nthe end."\r\n\r\nShe touched the rose at her breast. For a moment she seemed to forget him,\r\nthen quietly--"I thank you, I am very grateful." She opened the book and,\r\nplucking a petal from the rose, dropped it between the leaves. Then\r\nlooking up she said gently, "I cannot accept."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nIt took Clifford a month to entirely recover, although at the end of the\r\nfirst week he was pronounced convalescent by Elliott, who was an\r\nauthority, and his convalescence was aided by the cordiality with which\r\nRue Barree acknowledged his solemn salutes. Forty times a day he blessed\r\nRue Barree for her refusal, and thanked his lucky stars, and at the same\r\ntime, oh, wondrous heart of ours!--he suffered the tortures of the\r\nblighted.\r\n\r\nElliott was annoyed, partly by Clifford\'s reticence, partly by the\r\nunexplainable thaw in the frigidity of Rue Barree. At their frequent\r\nencounters, when she, tripping along the rue de Seine, with music-roll and\r\nbig straw hat would pass Clifford and his familiars steering an easterly\r\ncourse to the Cafe Vachette, and at the respectful uncovering of the band\r\nwould colour and smile at Clifford, Elliott\'s slumbering suspicions awoke.\r\nBut he never found out anything, and finally gave it up as beyond his\r\ncomprehension, merely qualifying Clifford as an idiot and reserving his\r\nopinion of Rue Barree. And all this time Selby was jealous. At first he\r\nrefused to acknowledge it to himself, and cut the studio for a day in the\r\ncountry, but the woods and fields of course aggravated his case, and the\r\nbrooks babbled of Rue Barree and the mowers calling to each other across\r\nthe meadow ended in a quavering "Rue Bar-ree-e!" That day spent in the\r\ncountry made him angry for a week, and he worked sulkily at Julian\'s, all\r\nthe time tormented by a desire to know where Clifford was and what he\r\nmight be doing. This culminated in an erratic stroll on Sunday which ended\r\nat the flower-market on the Pont au Change, began again, was gloomily\r\nextended to the morgue, and again ended at the marble bridge. It would\r\nnever do, and Selby felt it, so he went to see Clifford, who was\r\nconvalescing on mint juleps in his garden.\r\n\r\nThey sat down together and discussed morals and human happiness, and each\r\nfound the other most entertaining, only Selby failed to pump Clifford, to\r\nthe other\'s unfeigned amusement. But the juleps spread balm on the sting\r\nof jealousy, and trickled hope to the blighted, and when Selby said he\r\nmust go, Clifford went too, and when Selby, not to be outdone, insisted on\r\naccompanying Clifford back to his door, Clifford determined to see Selby\r\nback half way, and then finding it hard to part, they decided to dine\r\ntogether and "flit." To flit, a verb applied to Clifford\'s nocturnal\r\nprowls, expressed, perhaps, as well as anything, the gaiety proposed.\r\nDinner was ordered at Mignon\'s, and while Selby interviewed the chef,\r\nClifford kept a fatherly eye on the butler. The dinner was a success, or\r\nwas of the sort generally termed a success. Toward the dessert Selby heard\r\nsome one say as at a great distance, "Kid Selby, drunk as a lord."\r\n\r\nA group of men passed near them; it seemed to him that he shook hands and\r\nlaughed a great deal, and that everybody was very witty. There was\r\nClifford opposite swearing undying confidence in his chum Selby, and there\r\nseemed to be others there, either seated beside them or continually\r\npassing with the swish of skirts on the polished floor. The perfume of\r\nroses, the rustle of fans, the touch of rounded arms and the laughter grew\r\nvaguer and vaguer. The room seemed enveloped in mist. Then, all in a\r\nmoment each object stood out painfully distinct, only forms and visages\r\nwere distorted and voices piercing. He drew himself up, calm, grave, for\r\nthe moment master of himself, but very drunk. He knew he was drunk, and\r\nwas as guarded and alert, as keenly suspicious of himself as he would have\r\nbeen of a thief at his elbow. His self-command enabled Clifford to hold\r\nhis head safely under some running water, and repair to the street\r\nconsiderably the worse for wear, but never suspecting that his companion\r\nwas drunk. For a time he kept his self-command. His face was only a bit\r\npaler, a bit tighter than usual; he was only a trifle slower and more\r\nfastidious in his speech. It was midnight when he left Clifford peacefully\r\nslumbering in somebody\'s arm-chair, with a long suede glove dangling in\r\nhis hand and a plumy boa twisted about his neck to protect his throat from\r\ndrafts. He walked through the hall and down the stairs, and found himself\r\non the sidewalk in a quarter he did not know. Mechanically he looked up at\r\nthe name of the street. The name was not familiar. He turned and steered\r\nhis course toward some lights clustered at the end of the street. They\r\nproved farther away than he had anticipated, and after a long quest he\r\ncame to the conclusion that his eyes had been mysteriously removed from\r\ntheir proper places and had been reset on either side of his head like\r\nthose of a bird. It grieved him to think of the inconvenience this\r\ntransformation might occasion him, and he attempted to cock up his head,\r\nhen-like, to test the mobility of his neck. Then an immense despair stole\r\nover him,--tears gathered in the tear-ducts, his heart melted, and he\r\ncollided with a tree. This shocked him into comprehension; he stifled the\r\nviolent tenderness in his breast, picked up his hat and moved on more\r\nbriskly. His mouth was white and drawn, his teeth tightly clinched. He\r\nheld his course pretty well and strayed but little, and after an\r\napparently interminable length of time found himself passing a line of\r\ncabs. The brilliant lamps, red, yellow, and green annoyed him, and he felt\r\nit might be pleasant to demolish them with his cane, but mastering this\r\nimpulse he passed on. Later an idea struck him that it would save fatigue\r\nto take a cab, and he started back with that intention, but the cabs\r\nseemed already so far away and the lanterns were so bright and confusing\r\nthat he gave it up, and pulling himself together looked around.\r\n\r\nA shadow, a mass, huge, undefined, rose to his right. He recognized the\r\nArc de Triomphe and gravely shook his cane at it. Its size annoyed him. He\r\nfelt it was too big. Then he heard something fall clattering to the\r\npavement and thought probably it was his cane but it didn\'t much matter.\r\nWhen he had mastered himself and regained control of his right leg, which\r\nbetrayed symptoms of insubordination, he found himself traversing the\r\nPlace de la Concorde at a pace which threatened to land him at the\r\nMadeleine. This would never do. He turned sharply to the right and\r\ncrossing the bridge passed the Palais Bourbon at a trot and wheeled into\r\nthe Boulevard St. Germain. He got on well enough although the size of the\r\nWar Office struck him as a personal insult, and he missed his cane, which\r\nit would have been pleasant to drag along the iron railings as he passed.\r\nIt occurred to him, however, to substitute his hat, but when he found it\r\nhe forgot what he wanted it for and replaced it upon his head with\r\ngravity. Then he was obliged to battle with a violent inclination to sit\r\ndown and weep. This lasted until he came to the rue de Rennes, but there\r\nhe became absorbed in contemplating the dragon on the balcony overhanging\r\nthe Cour du Dragon, and time slipped away until he remembered vaguely that\r\nhe had no business there, and marched off again. It was slow work. The\r\ninclination to sit down and weep had given place to a desire for solitary\r\nand deep reflection. Here his right leg forgot its obedience and attacking\r\nthe left, outflanked it and brought him up against a wooden board which\r\nseemed to bar his path. He tried to walk around it, but found the street\r\nclosed. He tried to push it over, and found he couldn\'t. Then he noticed a\r\nred lantern standing on a pile of paving-stones inside the barrier. This\r\nwas pleasant. How was he to get home if the boulevard was blocked? But he\r\nwas not on the boulevard. His treacherous right leg had beguiled him into\r\na detour, for there, behind him lay the boulevard with its endless line of\r\nlamps,--and here, what was this narrow dilapidated street piled up with\r\nearth and mortar and heaps of stone? He looked up. Written in staring\r\nblack letters on the barrier was\r\n\r\nRUE BARREE.\r\n\r\nHe sat down. Two policemen whom he knew came by and advised him to get up,\r\nbut he argued the question from a standpoint of personal taste, and they\r\npassed on, laughing. For he was at that moment absorbed in a problem. It\r\nwas, how to see Rue Barree. She was somewhere or other in that big house\r\nwith the iron balconies, and the door was locked, but what of that? The\r\nsimple idea struck him to shout until she came. This idea was replaced by\r\nanother equally lucid,--to hammer on the door until she came; but finally\r\nrejecting both of these as too uncertain, he decided to climb into the\r\nbalcony, and opening a window politely inquire for Rue Barree. There was\r\nbut one lighted window in the house that he could see. It was on the\r\nsecond floor, and toward this he cast his eyes. Then mounting the wooden\r\nbarrier and clambering over the piles of stones, he reached the sidewalk\r\nand looked up at the facade for a foothold. It seemed impossible. But a\r\nsudden fury seized him, a blind, drunken obstinacy, and the blood rushed\r\nto his head, leaping, beating in his ears like the dull thunder of an\r\nocean. He set his teeth, and springing at a window-sill, dragged himself\r\nup and hung to the iron bars. Then reason fled; there surged in his brain\r\nthe sound of many voices, his heart leaped up beating a mad tattoo, and\r\ngripping at cornice and ledge he worked his way along the facade, clung to\r\npipes and shutters, and dragged himself up, over and into the balcony by\r\nthe lighted window. His hat fell off and rolled against the pane. For a\r\nmoment he leaned breathless against the railing--then the window was\r\nslowly opened from within.\r\n\r\nThey stared at each other for some time. Presently the girl took two\r\nunsteady steps back into the room. He saw her face,--all crimsoned\r\nnow,--he saw her sink into a chair by the lamplit table, and without a\r\nword he followed her into the room, closing the big door-like panes behind\r\nhim. Then they looked at each other in silence.\r\n\r\nThe room was small and white; everything was white about it,--the\r\ncurtained bed, the little wash-stand in the corner, the bare walls, the\r\nchina lamp,--and his own face,--had he known it, but the face and neck of\r\nRue were surging in the colour that dyed the blossoming rose-tree there on\r\nthe hearth beside her. It did not occur to him to speak. She seemed not to\r\nexpect it. His mind was struggling with the impressions of the room. The\r\nwhiteness, the extreme purity of everything occupied him--began to trouble\r\nhim. As his eye became accustomed to the light, other objects grew from\r\nthe surroundings and took their places in the circle of lamplight. There\r\nwas a piano and a coal-scuttle and a little iron trunk and a bath-tub.\r\nThen there was a row of wooden pegs against the door, with a white chintz\r\ncurtain covering the clothes underneath. On the bed lay an umbrella and a\r\nbig straw hat, and on the table, a music-roll unfurled, an ink-stand, and\r\nsheets of ruled paper. Behind him stood a wardrobe faced with a mirror,\r\nbut somehow he did not care to see his own face just then. He was\r\nsobering.\r\n\r\nThe girl sat looking at him without a word. Her face was expressionless,\r\nyet the lips at times trembled almost imperceptibly. Her eyes, so\r\nwonderfully blue in the daylight, seemed dark and soft as velvet, and the\r\ncolour on her neck deepened and whitened with every breath. She seemed\r\nsmaller and more slender than when he had seen her in the street, and\r\nthere was now something in the curve of her cheek almost infantine. When\r\nat last he turned and caught his own reflection in the mirror behind him,\r\na shock passed through him as though he had seen a shameful thing, and his\r\nclouded mind and his clouded thoughts grew clearer. For a moment their\r\neyes met then his sought the floor, his lips tightened, and the struggle\r\nwithin him bowed his head and strained every nerve to the breaking. And\r\nnow it was over, for the voice within had spoken. He listened, dully\r\ninterested but already knowing the end,--indeed it little mattered;--the\r\nend would always be the same for him;--he understood now--always the same\r\nfor him, and he listened, dully interested, to a voice which grew within\r\nhim. After a while he stood up, and she rose at once, one small hand\r\nresting on the table. Presently he opened the window, picked up his hat,\r\nand shut it again. Then he went over to the rosebush and touched the\r\nblossoms with his face. One was standing in a glass of water on the table\r\nand mechanically the girl drew it out, pressed it with her lips and laid\r\nit on the table beside him. He took it without a word and crossing the\r\nroom, opened the door. The landing was dark and silent, but the girl\r\nlifted the lamp and gliding past him slipped down the polished stairs to\r\nthe hallway. Then unchaining the bolts, she drew open the iron wicket.\r\n\r\nThrough this he passed with his rose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The King in Yellow, by Robert W.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\r\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
