The origin of\r\nthe whole story was probably Freytag\xe2\x80\x99s first series of pictures of German\r\nLife: probably, I say, for its first commencement was a dream, dreamt\r\nsome weeks after reading that most interesting collection of sketches.\r\nThe return of the squire with the tidings of the death of the two knights\r\nwas vividly depicted in sleep; and, though without local habitation or\r\nname, the scene was most likely to have been a reflection from the wild\r\nscenes so lately read of.\r\n\r\nIn fact, waking thoughts decided that such a catastrophe could hardly\r\nhave happened anywhere but in Germany, or in Scotland; and the contrast\r\nbetween the cultivation in the free cities and the savagery of the\r\nindependent barons made the former the more suitable region for the\r\nadventures.  The time could only be before the taming and bringing into\r\norder of the empire, when the Imperial cities were in their greatest\r\nsplendour, the last free nobles in course of being reduced from their\r\nlawless liberty, and the House of Austria beginning to acquire its\r\npreponderance over the other princely families.\r\n\r\nM. Freytag\xe2\x80\x99s books, and Hegewisch\xe2\x80\x99s History of Maximilian, will, I think,\r\nbe found fully to bear out the picture I have tried to give of the state\r\nof things in the reign of the Emperor Friedrich III., when, for want of\r\nany other law, _Faust recht_, or fist right, ruled; _i.e._ an offended\r\nnobleman, having once sent a _Fehde-brief_ to his adversary, was\r\nthenceforth at liberty to revenge himself by a private war, in which, for\r\nthe wrong inflicted, no justice was exacted.\r\n\r\nHegewisch remarks that the only benefit of this custom was, that the\r\nhonour of subscribing a feud-brief was so highly esteemed that it induced\r\nthe nobles to learn to write!  The League of St. George and the Swabian\r\nLeague were the means of gradually putting down this authorized condition\r\nof deadly feud.\r\n\r\nThis was in the days of Maximilian\xe2\x80\x99s youth.  He is a prince who seems to\r\nhave been almost as inferior in his foreign to what he was in his\r\ndomestic policy as was Queen Elizabeth.  He is chiefly familiar to us as\r\nfailing to keep up his authority in Flanders after the death of Mary of\r\nBurgundy, as lingering to fulfil his engagement with Anne of Brittany\r\ntill he lost her and her duchy, as incurring ridicule by his ill-managed\r\nschemes in Italy, and the vast projects that he was always forming\r\nwithout either means or steadiness to carry them out, by his perpetual\r\nimpecuniosity and slippery dealing; and in his old age he has become\r\nrather the laughing-stock of historians.\r\n\r\nBut there is much that is melancholy in the sight of a man endowed with\r\ngenius, unbalanced by the force of character that secures success, and\r\nwith an ardent nature whose intention overleapt obstacles that in\r\npractice he found insuperable.  At home Maximilian raised the Imperial\r\npower from a mere cipher to considerable weight.  We judge him as if he\r\nhad been born in the purple and succeeded to a defined power like his\r\ndescendants.  We forget that the head of the Holy Roman Empire had been,\r\never since the extinction of the Swabian line, a mere mark for ambitious\r\nprinces to shoot at, with everything expected from him, and no means to\r\ndo anything.  Maximilian\xe2\x80\x99s own father was an avaricious, undignified old\r\nman, not until near his death Archduke of even all Austria, and with\r\nanarchy prevailing everywhere under his nominal rule.  It was in the time\r\nof Maximilian that the Empire became as compact and united a body as\r\ncould be hoped of anything so unwieldy, that law was at least\r\nacknowledged, _Faust recht_ for ever abolished, and the Emperor became\r\nonce more a real power.\r\n\r\nThe man under whom all this was effected could have been no fool; yet, as\r\nhe said himself, he reigned over a nation of kings, who each chose to\r\nrule for himself; and the uncertainty of supplies of men or money to be\r\ngained from them made him so often fail necessarily in his engagements,\r\nthat he acquired a shiftiness and callousness to breaches of promise,\r\nwhich became the worst flaw in his character.  But of the fascination of\r\nhis manner there can be no doubt.  Even Henry VIII.\xe2\x80\x99s English\r\nambassadors, when forced to own how little they could depend on him, and\r\nhow dangerous it was to let subsidies pass through his fingers, still\r\nshow themselves under a sort of enchantment of devotion to his person,\r\nand this in his old age, and when his conduct was most inexcusable and\r\nprovoking.\r\n\r\nHis variety of powers was wonderful.  He was learned in many languages\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nall those of his empire or hereditary states, and in many besides; and he\r\nhad an ardent love of books, both classical and modern.  He delighted in\r\nmusic, painting, architecture, and many arts of a more mechanical\r\ndescription; wrote treatises on all these, and on other subjects,\r\nespecially gardening and gunnery.  He was the inventor of an improved\r\nlock to the arquebus, and first divined how to adapt the disposition of\r\nhis troops to the use of the newly-discovered fire-arms.  And in all\r\nthese things his versatile head and ready hand were personally employed,\r\nnot by deputy; while coupled with so much artistic taste was a violent\r\npassion for hunting, which carried him through many hairbreadth \xe2\x80\x99scapes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was plain,\xe2\x80\x9d he used to say, \xe2\x80\x9cthat God Almighty ruled the world, or\r\nhow could things go on with a rogue like Alexander VI. at the head of the\r\nChurch, and a mere huntsman like himself at the head of the Empire.\xe2\x80\x9d  His\r\n_bon-mots_ are numerous, all thoroughly characteristic, and showing that\r\nbrilliancy in conversation must have been one of his greatest charms.  It\r\nseems as if only self-control and resolution were wanting to have made\r\nhim a Charles, or an Alfred, the Great.\r\n\r\nThe romance of his marriage with the heiress of Burgundy is one of the\r\nbest known parts of his life.  He was scarcely two-and-twenty when he\r\nlost her, who perhaps would have given him the stability he wanted; but\r\nhis tender hove for her endured through life.  It is not improbable that\r\nit was this still abiding attachment that made him slack in overcoming\r\ndifficulties in the way of other contracts, and that he may have hoped\r\nthat his engagement to Bianca Sforza would come to nothing, like so many\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe most curious record of him is, however, in two books, the materials\r\nfor which he furnished, and whose composition and illustration he\r\nsuperintended, _Der Weise King_, and _Theurdank_, of both of which he is\r\nwell known to be the hero.  The White, or the Wise King, it is uncertain\r\nwhich, is a history of his education and exploits, in prose.  Every\r\nalternate page has its engraving, showing how the Young White King\r\nobtains instruction in painting, architecture, language, and all arts and\r\nsciences, the latter including magic\xe2\x80\x94which he learns of an old woman with\r\na long-tailed demon sitting, like Mother Hubbard\xe2\x80\x99s cat, on her\r\nshoulder\xe2\x80\x94and astrology.  In the illustration of this study an\r\nextraordinary figure of a cross within a circle appears in the sky, which\r\nprobably has some connection with his scheme of nativity, for it also\r\nappears on the breast of Ehrenhold, his constant companion in the\r\nmetrical history of his career, under the name of Theurdank.\r\n\r\nThe poetry of _Theurdank_ was composed by Maximilian\xe2\x80\x99s old\r\nwriting-master, Melchior Pfinznig; but the adventures were the Kaisar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown, communicated by himself, and he superintended the wood-cuts.  The\r\nname is explained to mean \xe2\x80\x9ccraving glory,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Glori\xc3\xa6memor.  The Germans\r\nlaugh to scorn a French translator, who rendered it \xe2\x80\x9cChermerci.\xe2\x80\x9d  It was\r\nannotated very soon after its publication, and each exploit explained and\r\naccounted for.  It is remarkable and touching in a man who married at\r\neighteen, and was a widower at twenty-two, that, in both books, the happy\r\nunion with his lady love is placed at the end\xe2\x80\x94not at the beginning of the\r\nbook; and in _Theurdank_, at least, the eternal reunion is clearly meant.\r\n\r\nIn this curious book, K\xc3\xb6nig R\xc3\xb6mreich, by whom every contemporary\r\nunderstood poor Charles of Burgundy\xe2\x80\x94thus posthumously made King of Rome\r\nby Maximilian, as the only honour in his power, betroths his daughter\r\nEhrenreich (rich in honour) to the Ritter Theurdank.  Soon after, by a\r\nmost mild version of Duke Charles\xe2\x80\x99s frightful end, K\xc3\xb6nig R\xc3\xb6mreich is seen\r\non his back dying in a garden, and Ehrenreich (as Mary really did)\r\ndespatches a ring to summon her betrothed.\r\n\r\nBut here Theurdank returns for answer that he means first to win honour\r\nby his exploits, and sets out with his comrade, Ehrenhold, in search\r\nthereof.  Ehrenhold never appears of the smallest use to him in any of\r\nthe dire adventures into which he falls, but only stands complacently by,\r\nand in effect may represent Fame, or perhaps that literary sage whom Don\r\nQuixote always supposed to be at hand to record his deeds of prowess.\r\n\r\nNext we are presented with the German impersonation of Satan as a wise\r\nold magician, only with claws instead of feet, commissioning his three\r\ncaptains (_hauptleutern_), F\xc3\xbcrwitz, Umfallo, and Neidelhard, to beset and\r\nruin Theurdank.  They are interpreted as the dangers of youth, middle\r\nlife, and old age\xe2\x80\x94Rashness, Disaster, and Distress (or Envy).  One at a\r\ntime they encounter him,\xe2\x80\x94not once, but again and again; and he has ranged\r\nunder each head, in entire contempt of real order of time, the perils he\r\nthinks owing to each foe.  F\xc3\xbcrwitz most justly gets the credit of\r\nMaximilian\xe2\x80\x99s perils on the steeple of Ulm, though, unfortunately, the\r\nartist has represented the daring climber as standing not much above the\r\nshoulders of F\xc3\xbcrwitz and Ehrenhold; and although the annotation tells us\r\nthat his \xe2\x80\x9chinder half foot\xe2\x80\x9d overhung the scaffold, the danger in the\r\nprint is not appalling.  F\xc3\xbcrwitz likewise inveigles him into putting the\r\npoint (_schn\xc3\xa4bel_) of his shoe into the wheel of a mill for turning stone\r\nballs, where he certainly hardly deserved to lose nothing but the beak of\r\nhis shoe.  This enemy also brings him into numerous unpleasant\r\npredicaments on precipices, where he hangs by one hand; while the chamois\r\nstand delighted on every available peak, F\xc3\xbcrwitz grins malevolently, and\r\nEhrenhold stands pointing at him over his shoulder.  Time and place are\r\ngiven in the notes for all these escapes.  After some twenty adventures\r\nF\xc3\xbcrwitz is beaten off, and Umfallo tries his powers.  Here the\r\nmisadventures do not involve so much folly on the hero\xe2\x80\x99s part\xe2\x80\x94though, to\r\nbe sure, he ventures into a lion\xe2\x80\x99s den unarmed, and has to beat off the\r\ninmates with a shovel.  But the other adventures are more rational.  He\r\ncatches a jester\xe2\x80\x94of admirably foolish expression\xe2\x80\x94putting a match to a\r\npowder-magazine; he is wonderfully preserved in mountain avalanches and\r\nhurricanes; reins up his horse on the verge of an abyss; falls through\r\nice in Holland and shows nothing but his head above it; cures himself of\r\na fever by draughts of water, to the great disgust of his physicians, and\r\nescapes a fire bursting out of a tall stove.\r\n\r\nNeidelhard brings his real battles and perils.  From this last he is in\r\ndanger of shipwreck, of assassination, of poison, in single combat, or in\r\nbattle; tumults of the people beset him; he is imprisoned as at Ghent.\r\nBut finally Neidelhard is beaten back; and the hero is presented to\r\nEhrenreich.  Ehrenhold recounts his triumphs, and accuses the three\r\ncaptains.  One is hung, another beheaded, the third thrown headlong from\r\na tower, and a guardian angel then summons Theurdank to his union with\r\nhis Queen.  No doubt this reunion was the life-dream of the harassed,\r\nbusy, inconsistent man, who flashed through the turmoils of the early\r\nsixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe adventures of Maximilian which have been adverted to in the story are\r\nall to be found in Theurdank, and in his early life he was probably the\r\nbrilliant eager person we have tried in some degree to describe.  In his\r\nlatter years it is well known that he was much struck by Luther\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narguments; and, indeed, he had long been conscious of need of Church\r\nreform, though his plans took the grotesque form of getting himself made\r\nPope, and taking all into his own hands.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was unwise to have ever so faintly sketched Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s career\r\nthrough the ensuing troubles; but the history of the star and of the\r\nspark in the stubble seemed to need completion; and the working out of\r\nthe character of the survivor was unfinished till his course had been\r\nthought over from the dawn of the Wittenberg teaching, which must have\r\nseemed no novelty to an heir of the doctrine of Tauler, and of the\r\nveritably Catholic divines of old times.  The idea is of the supposed\r\ncourse of a thoughtful, refined, conscientious man through the earlier\r\ntimes of the Reformation, glad of the hope of cleansing the Church, but\r\nhoping to cleanse, not to break away from her\xe2\x80\x94a hope that Luther himself\r\nlong cherished, and which was not entirely frustrated till the\r\nre-assembly at Trent in the next generation.  Justice has never been done\r\nto the men who feared to loose their hold on the Church Catholic as the\r\none body to which the promises were made.  Their loyalty has been treated\r\nas blindness, timidity, or superstition; but that there were many such\r\npersons, and those among the very highest minds of their time, no one can\r\nhave any doubt after reading such lives as those of Friedrich the Wise of\r\nSaxony, of Erasmus, of Vittoria Colonna, or of Cardinal Giustiniani.\r\n\r\n_April_ 9, 1836.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was too young and too delicate to reject                _Page_ 37\r\ncivilization, and she let Christina braid her hair, bathe\r\nher, and arrange her dress, with sensations of comfort\r\nthat were almost like health\xe2\x80\x9d  _Front_\r\nHenceforth mine own lady-mother is the mistress of this            126\r\ncastle, and whoever speaks a rude word to her offends the\r\nFreiherr von Adlerstein\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No; only I saw that you stayed here all alone,\xe2\x80\x99 she              269\r\nsaid, clasping her hands\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\nMASTER GOTTFRIED\xe2\x80\x99S WORKSHOP\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE upper lattices of a tall, narrow window were open, and admitted the\r\nview, of first some richly-tinted vine leaves and purpling grapes, then,\r\nin dazzling freshness of new white stone, the lacework fabric of a\r\nhalf-built minster spire, with a mason\xe2\x80\x99s crane on the summit, bending as\r\nthough craving for a further supply of materials; and beyond, peeping\r\nthrough every crevice of the exquisite open fretwork, was the intensely\r\nblue sky of early autumn.\r\n\r\nThe lower longer panes of the window were closed, and the glass, divided\r\ninto circles and quarrels, made the scene less distinct; but still the\r\nhuge stone tower was traceable, and, farther off, the slope of a\r\ngently-rising hill, clothed with vineyards blushing into autumn richness.\r\nBelow, the view was closed by the gray wall of a court-yard, laden with\r\nfruit-trees in full bearing, and inclosing paved paths that radiated from\r\na central fountain, and left spaces between, where a few summer flowers\r\nstill lingered, and the remains of others showed what their past glory\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the room was wainscoted, the floor paved with bright red\r\nand cream-coloured tiles, and the tall stove in one corner decorated with\r\nthe same.  The eastern end of the apartment was adorned with an exquisite\r\nsmall group carved in oak, representing the carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s shop at Nazareth,\r\nwith the Holy Child instructed by Joseph in the use of tools, and the\r\nMother sitting with her book, \xe2\x80\x9cpondering these things in her heart.\xe2\x80\x9d  All\r\naround were blocks of wood and carvings in varying states of\r\nprogress\xe2\x80\x94some scarcely shaped out, and others in perfect completion.  And\r\nthe subjects were equally various.  Here was an adoring angel with folded\r\nwings, clasped hands, and rapt face; here a majestic head of an apostle\r\nor prophet; here a lovely virgin saint, seeming to play smilingly with\r\nthe instrument of her martyrdom; here a grotesque _miserere_ group,\r\nillustrating a fairy tale, or caricaturing a popular fable here a\r\nbeauteous festoon of flowers and fruit, emulating nature in all save\r\ncolour; and on the work-table itself, growing under the master\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\r\nwas a long wreath, entirely composed of leaves and seed-vessels in their\r\nquaint and beauteous forms\xe2\x80\x94the heart-shaped shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s purse, the\r\nmask-like skull-cap, and the crowned urn of the henbane.  The starred cap\r\nof the poppy was actually being shaped under the tool, copied from a\r\ngreen capsule, surmounted with purple velvety rays, which, together with\r\nits rough and wavy leaf, was held in the hand of a young maiden who knelt\r\nby the table, watching the work with eager interest.\r\n\r\nShe was not a beautiful girl\xe2\x80\x94not one of those whose \xe2\x80\x9cbright eyes rain\r\ninfluence, and judge the prize.\xe2\x80\x9d  She was too small, too slight, too\r\nretiring for such a position.  If there was something lily-like in her\r\ndrooping grace, it was not the queen-lily of the garden that she\r\nresembled, but the retiring lily of the valley\xe2\x80\x94so purely, transparently\r\nwhite was her skin, scarcely tinted by a roseate blush on the cheek, so\r\ntender and modest the whole effect of her slender figure, and the soft,\r\ndowncast, pensive brown eyes, utterly dissimilar in hue from those of all\r\nher friends and kindred, except perhaps the bright, quick ones of her\r\nuncle, the master-carver.  Otherwise, his portly form, open visage, and\r\ngood-natured stateliness, as well as his furred cap and gold chain, were\r\nthoroughly those of the German burgomaster of the fifteenth century; but\r\nthose glittering black eyes had not ceased to betray their French, or\r\nrather Walloon, origin, though for several generations back the family\r\nhad been settled at Ulm.  Perhaps, too, it was Walloon quickness and\r\nreadiness of wit that had made them, so soon as they became affiliated,\r\nso prominent in all the councils of the good free city, and so noted for\r\nexcellence in art and learning.  Indeed the present head of the family,\r\nMaster Gottfried Sorel, was so much esteemed for his learning that he had\r\nonce had serious thoughts of terming himself Magister Gothofredus\r\nOxalicus, and might have carried it out but for the very decided\r\nobjections of his wife, Dame Johanna, and his little niece, Christina, to\r\nbeing dubbed by any such surname.\r\n\r\nMaster Gottfried had had a scapegrace younger brother named Hugh, who had\r\nscorned both books and tools, had been the plague of the workshop, and,\r\ninstead of coming back from his wandering year of improvement, had joined\r\na band of roving Lanzknechts.  No more had been heard of him for a dozen\r\nor fifteen years, when he suddenly arrived at the paternal mansion at\r\nUlm, half dead with intermittent fever, and with a young, broken-hearted,\r\nand nearly expiring wife, his spoil in his Italian campaigns.  His rude\r\naffection had utterly failed to console her for her desolated home and\r\nslaughtered kindred, and it had so soon turned to brutality that, when\r\nbrought to comparative peace and rest in his brother\xe2\x80\x99s home, there was\r\nnothing left for the poor Italian but to lie down and die, commending her\r\nbabe in broken German to Hausfrau Johanna, and blessing Master Gottfried\r\nfor his flowing Latin assurances that the child should be to them even as\r\nthe little maiden who was lying in the God\xe2\x80\x99s acre upon the hillside.\r\n\r\nAnd verily the little Christina had been a precious gift to the bereaved\r\ncouple.  Her father had no sooner recovered than he returned to his\r\nroving life, and, except for a report that he had been seen among the\r\nretainers of one of the robber barons of the Swabian Alps, nothing had\r\nbeen heard of him; and Master Gottfried only hoped to be spared the\r\nactual pain and scandal of knowing when his eyes were blinded and his\r\nhead swept off at a blow, or when he was tumbled headlong into a moat,\r\nsuspended from a tree, or broken on the wheel: a choice of fates that was\r\nsure sooner or later to befall him.  Meantime, both the burgomeister and\r\nburgomeisterinn did their utmost to forget that the gentle little girl\r\nwas not their own; they set all their hopes and joys on her, and, making\r\nher supply the place at once of son and daughter, they bred her up in all\r\nthe refinements and accomplishments in which the free citizens of Germany\r\ntook the lead in the middle and latter part of the fifteenth century.  To\r\naid her aunt in all house-wifely arts, to prepare dainty food and varied\r\nliquors, and to spin, weave, and broider, was only a part of Christina\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntraining; her uncle likewise set great store by her sweet Italian voice,\r\nand caused her to be carefully taught to sing and play on the lute, and\r\nhe likewise delighted in hearing her read aloud to him from the\r\nhereditary store of MSS. and from the dark volumes that began to proceed\r\nfrom the press.  Nay, Master Gottfried had made experiments in printing\r\nand wood-engraving on his own account, and had found no head so\r\nintelligent, no hand so desirous to aid him, as his little Christina\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nwho, in all that needed taste and skill rather than strength, was worth\r\nall his prentices and journeymen together.  Some fine bold wood-cuts had\r\nbeen produced by their joint efforts; but these less important\r\noccupations had of late been set aside by the engrossing interest of the\r\ninterior fittings of the great \xe2\x80\x9cDome Kirk,\xe2\x80\x9d which for nearly a century\r\nhad been rising by the united exertions of the burghers, without any\r\nassistance from without.  The foundation had been laid in 1377; and at\r\nlength, in the year of grace 1472, the crown of the apse had been closed\r\nin, and matters were so forward that Master Gottfried\xe2\x80\x99s stall work was\r\nalready in requisition for the choir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree cubits more,\xe2\x80\x9d he reckoned.  \xe2\x80\x9cChild, hast thou found me fruits\r\nenough for the completing of this border?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes, mine uncle.  I have the wild rosehip, and the flat shield of the\r\nmoonwort, and a pea-pod, and more whose names I know not.  But should\r\nthey all be seed and fruit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea, truly, my Stina, for this wreath shall speak of the goodly fruits\r\nof a completed life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven as that which you carved in spring told of the blossom and fair\r\npromise of youth,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the maiden.  \xe2\x80\x9cMethinks the one is the most\r\nbeautiful, as it ought to be;\xe2\x80\x9d then, after a little pause, and some\r\nreckoning, \xe2\x80\x9cI have scarce seed-pods enough in store, uncle; might we not\r\nseek some rarer shapes in the herb-garden of Master Gerhard, the\r\nphysician?  He, too, might tell me the names of some of these.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, child; or we might ride into the country beyond the walls, and\r\nseek them.  What, little one, wouldst thou not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo we go not far,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Christina, colouring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa, thou hast not forgotten the fright thy companions had from the\r\nSchlangenwald reitern when gathering Maydew?  Fear not, little coward; if\r\nwe go beyond the suburbs we will take Hans and Peter with their halberts.\r\nBut I believe thy silly little heart can scarce be free for enjoyment if\r\nit can fancy a Reiter within a dozen leagues of thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt your side I would not fear.  That is, I would not vex thee by my\r\nfolly, and I might forget it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Christina, looking down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy gentle child!\xe2\x80\x9d the old man said approvingly.  \xe2\x80\x9cMoreover, if our good\r\nRaiser has his way, we shall soon be free of the reitern of\r\nSchlangenwald, and Adlerstein, and all the rest of the mouse-trap barons.\r\nHe is hoping to form a league of us free imperial cities with all the\r\nmore reasonable and honest nobles, to preserve the peace of the country.\r\nEven now a letter from him was read in the Town Hall to that effect; and,\r\nwhen all are united against them, my lords-mousers must needs become\r\npledged to the league, or go down before it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! that will be well,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Christina.  \xe2\x80\x9cThen will our wagons be no\r\nlonger set upon at the Debateable Ford by Schlangenwald or Adlerstein;\r\nand our wares will come safely, and there will be wealth enough to raise\r\nour spire!  O uncle, what a day of joy will that be when Our Lady\xe2\x80\x99s great\r\nstatue will be set on the summit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA day that I shall scarce see, and it will be well if thou dost,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned her uncle, \xe2\x80\x9cunless the hearts of the burghers of Ulm return to\r\nthe liberality of their fathers, who devised that spire!  But what\r\ntrampling do I hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was indeed a sudden confusion in the house, and, before the uncle\r\nand niece could rise, the door was opened by a prosperous apple-faced\r\ndame, exclaiming in a hasty whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cHousefather, O Housefather, there\r\nare a troop of reitern at the door, dismounting already;\xe2\x80\x9d and, as the\r\nmaster came forward, brushing from his furred vest the shavings and dust\r\nof his work, she added in a more furtive, startled accent, \xe2\x80\x9cand, if I\r\nmistake not, one is thy brother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is welcome,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Master Gottfried, in his cheery fearless voice;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9che brought us a choice gift last time he came; and it may be he is ready\r\nto seek peace among us after his wanderings.  Come hither, Christina, my\r\nlittle one; it is well to be abashed, but thou art not a child who need\r\nfear to meet a father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristina\xe2\x80\x99s extreme timidity, however, made her pale and crimson by\r\nturns, perhaps by the infection of anxiety from her aunt, who could not\r\nconceal a certain dissatisfaction and alarm, as the maiden, led on either\r\nside by her adopted parents, thus advanced from the little studio into a\r\nhandsomely-carved wooden gallery, projecting into a great wainscoated\r\nroom, with a broad carved stair leading down into it.  Down this stair\r\nthe three proceeded, and reached the stone hall that lay beyond it, just\r\nas there entered from the trellised porch, that covered the steps into\r\nthe street, a thin wiry man, in a worn and greasy buff suit, guarded on\r\nthe breast and arms with rusty steel, and a battered helmet with the\r\nvizor up, disclosing a weather-beaten bronzed face, with somewhat wild\r\ndark eyes, and a huge grizzled moustache forming a straight line over his\r\nlips.  Altogether he was a complete model of the lawless Reiter or\r\nLanzknecht, the terror of Swabia, and the bugbear of Christina\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimagination.  The poor child\xe2\x80\x99s heart died within her as she perceived the\r\nmutual recognition between her uncle and the new comer; and, while Master\r\nGottfried held out his hands with a cordial greeting of \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome, home,\r\nbrother Hugh,\xe2\x80\x9d she trembled from head to foot, as she sank on her knees,\r\nand murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cYour blessing, honoured father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa?  What, this is my girl?  What says she?  My blessing, eh?  There\r\nthen, thou hast it, child, such as I have to give, though they\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nthee at Adlerstein that I am more wont to give the other sort of\r\nblessing!  Now, give me a kiss, girl, and let me see thee!  How now!\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\nhe folded her in his rough arms; \xe2\x80\x9cthou art a mere feather, as slight as\r\nour sick Jungfrau herself.\xe2\x80\x9d  And then, regarding her, as she stood\r\ndrooping, \xe2\x80\x9cThou art not half the woman thy mother was\xe2\x80\x94she was stately and\r\nstraight as a column, and tall withal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hausfrau Johanna, in a marked tone; \xe2\x80\x9cbut both she and her\r\npoor babe had been so harassed and wasted with long journeys and\r\nhardships, that with all our care of our Christina, she has never been\r\nstrong or well-grown.  The marvel is that she lived at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur Christina is not beautiful, we know,\xe2\x80\x9d added her uncle, reassuringly\r\ntaking her hand; \xe2\x80\x9cbut she is a good and meek maiden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Lanzknecht, \xe2\x80\x9cshe will answer the purpose well\r\nenough, or better than if she were fair enough to set all our fellows\r\ntogether by the ears for her.  Camilla, I say\xe2\x80\x94no, what\xe2\x80\x99s her name,\r\nChristina?\xe2\x80\x94put up thy gear and be ready to start with me to-morrow\r\nmorning for Adlerstein.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Adlerstein?\xe2\x80\x9d re-echoed the housemother, in a tone of horrified\r\ndismay; and Christina would have dropped on the floor but for her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsustaining hand, and the cheering glance with which he met her imploring\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us come up to the gallery, and understand what you desire, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Master Gottfried, gravely.  \xe2\x80\x9cFill the cup of greeting, Hans.  Your\r\nfollowers shall be entertained in the hall,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Hugh, \xe2\x80\x9cI will show you reason over a goblet of the old\r\nRosenburg.  Is it all gone yet, brother Goetz?  No?  I reckon there would\r\nnot be the scouring of a glass left of it in a week if it were at\r\nAdlerstein.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, the trooper crossed the lower room, which contained a huge\r\ntiled baking oven, various brilliantly-burnished cooking utensils, and a\r\ngreat carved cupboard like a wooden bedstead, and, passing the door of\r\nthe bathroom, clanked up the oaken stairs to the gallery, the\r\nreception-room of the house.  It had tapestry hangings to the wall, and\r\ncushions both to the carved chairs and deep windows, which looked out\r\ninto the street, the whole storey projecting into close proximity with\r\nthe corresponding apartment of the Syndic Moritz, the goldsmith on the\r\nopposite side.  An oaken table stood in the centre, and the gallery was\r\nadorned with a dresser, displaying not only bright pewter, but goblets\r\nand drinking cups of beautifully-shaped and coloured glass, and\r\nsaltcellars, tankards, &c. of gold and silver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as it was in the old man\xe2\x80\x99s time,\xe2\x80\x9d said the soldier, throwing\r\nhimself into the housefather\xe2\x80\x99s chair.  \xe2\x80\x9cA handful of Lanzknechts would\r\nmake short work with your pots and pans, good sister Johanna.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Johanna under her breath.  \xe2\x80\x9cMuch good they do\r\nyou, up in a row there, making you a slave to furbishing them.  There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmore sense in a chair like this\xe2\x80\x94that does rest a man\xe2\x80\x99s bones.  Here,\r\nCamilla, girl, unlace my helmet!  What, know\xe2\x80\x99st not how?  What is a woman\r\nmade for but to let a soldier free of his trappings?  Thou hast done it!\r\nThere!  Now my boots,\xe2\x80\x9d stretching out his legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHans shall draw off your boots, fair brother,\xe2\x80\x9d began the dame; but poor\r\nChristina, the more anxious to propitiate him in little things, because\r\nof the horror and dread with which his main purpose inspired her, was\r\nalready on her knees, pulling with her small quivering hands at the long\r\nsteel-guarded boot\xe2\x80\x94a task to which she would have been utterly\r\ninadequate, but for some lazy assistance from her father\xe2\x80\x99s other foot.\r\nShe further brought a pair of her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s furred slippers, while Reiter\r\nHugh proceeded to dangle one of the boots in the air, expatiating on its\r\nfrail condition, and expressing his intention of getting a new pair from\r\nMaster Matthias, the sutor, ere he should leave Ulm on the morrow.  Then,\r\nagain, came the dreaded subject; his daughter must go with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you with Christina, brother?\xe2\x80\x9d gravely asked Master Gottfried,\r\nseating himself on the opposite side of the stove, while out of sight the\r\nfrightened girl herself knelt on the floor, her head on her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s knees,\r\ntrying to derive comfort from Dame Johanna\xe2\x80\x99s clasping hands, and vehement\r\nmurmurs that they would not let their child be taken from them.  Alas!\r\nthese assurances were little in accordance with Hugh\xe2\x80\x99s rough reply, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nwhat is it to you what I do with mine own?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly this, that, having bred her up as my child and intended heiress, I\r\nmight have some voice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! in choosing her mate!  Some mincing artificer, I trow, fiddling away\r\nwith wood and wire to make gauds for the fair-day!  Hast got him here?\r\nIf I like him, and she likes him, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring her back when her work is\r\ndone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no such person as yet in the case,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gottfried.  \xe2\x80\x9cChristina\r\nis not yet seventeen, and I would take my time to find an honest, pious\r\nburgher, who will value this precious jewel of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd let her polish his flagons to the end of her days,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Hugh\r\ngrimly, but manifestly somewhat influenced by the notion of his brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwealth.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, hast no child of thine own?\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone, save in Paradise,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Gottfried, crossing himself.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nthus, if Christina should remain with me, and be such as I would have\r\nher, then, brother, my wealth, after myself and my good housewife, shall\r\nbe hers, with due provision for thee, if thou shouldst weary of thy wild\r\nlife.  Otherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, looking down, and speaking in an under tone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmy poor savings should go to the completion of the Dome Kirk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who told thee, Goetz, that I would do ought with the girl that\r\nshould hinder her from being the very same fat, sourkrout-cooking,\r\npewter-scrubbing housewife of thy mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard nothing of thy designs as yet, brother Hugh, save that thou\r\nwouldst take her to Adlerstein, which men greatly belie if it be not a\r\nnest of robbers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha! thou hast heard of Adlerstein!  We have made the backs of your\r\njolly merchants tingle as well as they could through their well-lined\r\ndoublets!  Ulm knows of Adlerstein, and the Debateable Ford!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt knows little to its credit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gottfried, gravely; \xe2\x80\x9cand it knows\r\nalso that the Emperor is about to make a combination against all the\r\nSwabian robber-holds, and that such as join not in it will fare the\r\nworse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet Kaiser Fritz catch his bear ere he sells its hide!  He has never\r\ntried to mount the Eagle\xe2\x80\x99s Ladder!  Why, man, Adlerstein might be held\r\nagainst five hundred men by sister Johanna with her rock and spindle!\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis a free barony, Master Gottfried, I tell thee\xe2\x80\x94has never sworn\r\nallegiance to Kaiser or Duke of Swabia either!  Freiherr Eberhard is as\r\nmuch a king on his own rock as Kaiser Fritz ever was of the Romans, and\r\nmore too, for I never could find out that they thought much of our king\r\nat Rome; and, as to gainsaying our old Freiherr, one might as well leap\r\nover the abyss at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, those old free barons are pitiless tyrants,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gottfried, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nscarce think I can understand thee aright when I hear thee say thou\r\nwouldst carry thy daughter to such an abode.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the Freiherr\xe2\x80\x99s command,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Hugh.  \xe2\x80\x9cLook you, they have had\r\nwondrous ill-luck with their children; the Freiherrinn Kunigunde has had\r\na dozen at least, and only two are alive, my young Freiherr and my young\r\nLady Ermentrude; and no wonder, you would say, if you could see the\r\ngracious Freiherrinn, for surely Dame Holda made a blunder when she\r\nfished her out of the fountain woman instead of man.  She is Adlerstein\r\nherself by birth, married her cousin, and is prouder and more dour than\r\nour old Freiherr himself\xe2\x80\x94fitter far to handle shield than swaddled babe.\r\nAnd now our Jungfrau has fallen into a pining waste, that \xe2\x80\x99tis a pity to\r\nsee how her cheeks have fallen away, and how she mopes and fades.  Now,\r\nthe old Freiherr and her brother, they both dote on her, and would do\r\nanything for her.  They thought she was bewitched, so we took old Mother\r\nIlsebill and tried her with the ordeal of water; but, look you, she sank\r\nas innocent as a puppy dog, and Ursel was at fault to fix on any one\r\nelse.  Then one day, when I looked into the chamber, I saw the poor\r\nmaiden sitting, with her head hanging down, as if \xe2\x80\x99twas too heavy for\r\nher, on a high-backed chair, no rest for her feet, and the wind blowing\r\nkeen all round her, and nothing to taste but scorched beef, or black\r\nbread and sour wine, and her mother rating her for foolish fancies that\r\ngave trouble.  And, when my young Freiherr was bemoaning himself that we\r\ncould not hear of a Jew physician passing our way to catch and bring up\r\nto cure her, I said to him at last that no doctor could do for her what\r\ngentle tendance and nursing would, for what the poor maiden needed was to\r\nbe cosseted and laid down softly, and fed with broths and possets, and\r\nall that women know how to do with one another.  A proper scowl and hard\r\nwords I got from my gracious Lady, for wanting to put burgher softness\r\ninto an Adlerstein; but my old lord and his son opened on the scent at\r\nonce.  \xe2\x80\x98Thou hast a daughter?\xe2\x80\x99 quoth the Freiherr.  \xe2\x80\x98So please your\r\ngracious lordship,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth I; \xe2\x80\x98that is, if she still lives, for I left her\r\na puny infant.\xe2\x80\x99  \xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said my lord, \xe2\x80\x98if thou wilt bring her here, and\r\nher care restores my daughter to health and strength, then will I make\r\nthee my body squire, with a right to a fourth part of all the spoil, and\r\nfeed for two horses in my stable.\xe2\x80\x99  And young Freiherr Eberhard gave his\r\nword upon it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGottfried suggested that a sick nurse was the person required rather than\r\na child like Christina; but, as Hugh truly observed, no nurse would\r\nvoluntarily go to Adlerstein, and it was no use to wait for the hopes of\r\ncapturing one by raid or foray.  His daughter was at his own disposal,\r\nand her services would be repaid by personal advantages to himself which\r\nhe was not disposed to forego; in effect these were the only means that\r\nthe baron had of requiting any attendance upon his daughter.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of old Germany had the strongest and most stringent ideas of\r\nparental authority, and regarded daughters as absolute chattels of their\r\nfather; and Master Gottfried Sorel, though he alone had done the part of\r\na parent to his niece, felt entirely unable to withstand the nearer\r\nclaim, except by representations; and these fell utterly disregarded, as\r\nin truth every counsel had hitherto done, upon the ears of Reiter Hugh,\r\never since he had emerged from his swaddling clothes.  The plentiful\r\nsupper, full cup of wine, the confections, the soft chair, together\r\nperhaps with his brother\xe2\x80\x99s grave speech, soon, however, had the effect of\r\nsending him into a doze, whence he started to accept civilly the proposal\r\nof being installed in the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s room, where he was speedily snoring\r\nbetween two feather beds.\r\n\r\nThen there could be freedom of speech in the gallery, where the uncle and\r\naunt held anxious counsel over the poor little dark-tressed head that\r\nstill lay upon good Johanna\xe2\x80\x99s knees.  The dame was indignant and\r\nresolute: \xe2\x80\x9cTake the child back with him into a very nest of robbers!\xe2\x80\x94her\r\nown innocent dove whom they had shielded from all evil like a very nun in\r\na cloister!  She should as soon think of yielding her up to be borne off\r\nby the great Satan himself with his horns and hoofs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHugh is her father, housewife,\xe2\x80\x9d said the master-carver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe right of parents is with those that have done the duty of parents,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned Johanna.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat said the kid in the fable to the goat that\r\nclaimed her from the sheep that bred her up?  I am ashamed of you,\r\nhousefather, for not better loving your own niece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven knows how I love her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gottfried, as the sweet face was\r\nraised up to him with a look acquitting him of the charge, and he bent to\r\nsmooth back the silken hair, and kiss the ivory brow; \xe2\x80\x9cbut Heaven also\r\nknows that I see no means of withholding her from one whose claim is\r\ncloser than my own\xe2\x80\x94none save one; and to that even thou, housemother,\r\nwouldst not have me resort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the dame, sharply, yet with some fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo denounce him to the burgomasters as one of the Adlerstein retainers\r\nwho robbed Philipp der Schmidt, and have him fast laid by the heels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristina shuddered, and Dame Johanna herself recoiled; but presently\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cNay, you could not do that, good man, but wherefore not\r\nthreaten him therewith?  Stand at his bedside in early dawn, and tell him\r\nthat, if he be not off ere daylight with both his cut-throats, the\r\nhalberdiers will be upon him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThreaten what I neither could nor would perform, mother?  That were a\r\nshrewish resource.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet would it save the child,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Johanna.  But, in the meantime,\r\nChristina was rising from the floor, and stood before them with loose\r\nhair, tearful eyes, and wet, flushed cheeks.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be thus,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, in a low, but not unsteady voice.  \xe2\x80\x9cI can bear it better since I\r\nhave heard of the poor young lady, sick and with none to care for her.  I\r\nwill go with my father; it is my duty.  I will do my best; but oh! uncle,\r\nso work with him that he may bring me back again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis from thee, Stina!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed her aunt; \xe2\x80\x9cfrom thee who art sick for\r\nfear of a lanzknecht!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe saints will be with me, and you will pray for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina,\r\nstill trembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell thee, child, thou knowst not what these vile dens are.  Heaven\r\nforfend thou shouldst!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed her aunt.  \xe2\x80\x9cGo only to Father\r\nBalthazar, housefather, and see if he doth not call it a sending of a\r\nlamb among wolves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind\xe2\x80\x99st thou the carving I did for Father Balthazar\xe2\x80\x99s own oratory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied Master Gottfried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI talk not of carving!  I talk of our child!\xe2\x80\x9d said the dame, petulantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ut agnus inter lupos_,\xe2\x80\x9d softly said Gottfried, looking tenderly, though\r\nsadly, at his niece, who not only understood the quotation, but well\r\nremembered the carving of the cross-marked lamb going forth from its fold\r\namong the howling wolves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!  I am not an apostle,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, but, in the path of duty, \xe2\x80\x99tis the same hand that sends thee\r\nforth,\xe2\x80\x9d answered her uncle, \xe2\x80\x9cand the same will guard thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuty, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Johanna.  \xe2\x80\x9cAs if any duty could lead that silly\r\nhelpless child among that herd of evil men, and women yet worse, with a\r\ngood-for-nothing father, who would sell her for a good horse to the first\r\ndissolute Junker who fell in his way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will take care that he knows it is worth his while to restore her safe\r\nto us.  Nor do I think so ill of Hugh as thou dost, mother.  And, for the\r\nrest, Heaven and the saints and her own discretion must be her guard till\r\nshe shall return to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can Heaven be expected to protect her when you are flying in its\r\nface by not taking counsel with Father Balthazar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat shalt thou do,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gottfried, readily, secure that Father\r\nBalthazar would see the matter in the same light as himself, and\r\ntranquillize the good woman.  It was not yet so late but that a servant\r\ncould be despatched with a request that Father Balthazar, who lived not\r\nmany houses off in the same street, would favour the Burgomeisterinn\r\nSorel by coming to speak with her.  In a few minutes he appeared,\xe2\x80\x94an aged\r\nman, with a sensible face, of the fresh pure bloom preserved by a\r\ntemperate life.  He was a secular parish-priest, and, as well as his\r\nfriend Master Gottfried, held greatly by the views left by the famous\r\nStrasburg preacher, Master John Tauler.  After the good housemother had,\r\nin strong terms, laid the case before him, she expected a trenchant\r\ndecision on her own side, but, to her surprise and disappointment, he\r\ndeclared that Master Gottfried was right, and that, unless Hugh Sorel\r\ndemanded anything absolutely sinful of his daughter, it was needful that\r\nshe should submit.  He repeated, in stronger terms, the assurance that\r\nshe would be protected in the endeavour to do right, and the Divine\r\npromises which he quoted from the Latin Scriptures gave some comfort to\r\nthe niece, who understood them, while they impressed the aunt, who did\r\nnot.  There was always the hope that, whether the young lady died or\r\nrecovered, the conclusion of her illness would be the term of Christina\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstay at Adlerstein, and with this trust Johanna must content herself.\r\nThe priest took leave, after appointing with Christina to meet her in the\r\nconfessional early in the morning before mass; and half the night was\r\nspent by the aunt and niece in preparing Christina\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe for her\r\nsudden journey.\r\n\r\nMany a tear was shed over the tokens of the little services she was wont\r\nto render, her half-done works, and pleasant studies so suddenly broken\r\noff, and all the time Hausfrau Johanna was running on with a lecture on\r\nthe diligent preservation of her maiden discretion, with plentiful\r\nwarnings against swaggering men-at-arms, drunken lanzknechts, and, above\r\nall, against young barons, who most assuredly could mean no good by any\r\nburgher maiden.  The good aunt blessed the saints that her Stina was\r\nlikely only to be lovely in affectionate home eyes; but, for that matter,\r\nidle men, shut up in a castle, with nothing but mischief to think of,\r\nwould be dangerous to Little Three Eyes herself, and Christina had best\r\nnever stir a yard from her lady\xe2\x80\x99s chair, when forced to meet them.  All\r\nthis was interspersed with motherly advice how to treat the sick lady,\r\nand receipts for cordials and possets; for Johanna began to regard the\r\ncase as a sort of second-hand one of her own.  Nay, she even turned it\r\nover in her mind whether she should not offer herself as the Lady\r\nErmentrude\xe2\x80\x99s sick-nurse, as being a less dangerous commodity than her\r\nlittle niece: but fears for the well-being of the master-carver, and his\r\nWirthschaft, and still more the notion of gossip Gertrude Grundt hearing\r\nthat she had ridden off with a wild lanzknecht, made her at once reject\r\nthe plan, without even mentioning it to her husband or his niece.\r\n\r\nBy the time Hugh Sorel rolled out from between his feather beds, and was\r\nabout to don his greasy buff, a handsome new suit, finished point device,\r\nand a pair of huge boots to correspond, had been laid by his bedside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo, ho!  Master Goetz,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as he stumbled into the Stube, \xe2\x80\x9cI see\r\nthy game.  Thou wouldst make it worth my while to visit the father-house\r\nat Ulm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be worth thy while, indeed, if thou bringest me back my white\r\ndove,\xe2\x80\x9d was Gottfried\xe2\x80\x99s answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how if I bring her back with a strapping reiter son-in-law?\xe2\x80\x9d laughed\r\nHugh.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat welcome should the fellow receive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would depend on what he might be,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gottfried; and Hugh, his\r\nlove of tormenting a little allayed by satisfaction in his buff suit, and\r\nby an eye to a heavy purse that lay by his brother\xe2\x80\x99s hand on the table,\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cLittle fear of that.  Our fellows would look for lustier brides\r\nthan yon little pale face.  \xe2\x80\x99Tis whiter than ever this morning,\xe2\x80\x94but no\r\ntears.  That is my brave girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, father, I am ready to do your bidding,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Christina, meekly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is well, child.  Mark me, no tears.  Thy mother wept day and night,\r\nand, when she had wept out her tears, she was sullen, when I would have\r\nbeen friendly towards her.  It was the worse for her.  But, so long as\r\nthou art good daughter to me, thou shalt find me good father to thee;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand for a moment there was a kindliness in his eye which made it\r\nsufficiently like that of his brother to give some consolation to the\r\nshrinking heart that he was rending from all it loved; and she steadied\r\nher voice for another gentle profession of obedience, for which she felt\r\nstrengthened by the morning\xe2\x80\x99s orisons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell said, child.  Now canst sit on old Nibelung\xe2\x80\x99s croup?  His back-bone\r\nis somewhat sharper than if he had battened in a citizen\xe2\x80\x99s stall; but, if\r\nthine aunt can find thee some sort of pillion, I\xe2\x80\x99ll promise thee the best\r\nride thou hast had since we came from Innspruck, ere thou canst\r\nremember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristina has her own mule,\xe2\x80\x9d replied her uncle, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout troubling\r\nNibelung to carry double.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo! her own!  An overfed burgomaster sort of a beast, that will turn\r\nrestive at the first sight of the Eagle\xe2\x80\x99s Ladder!  However, he may carry\r\nher so far, and, if we cannot get him up the mountain, I shall know what\r\nto do with him,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered to himself.\r\n\r\nBut Hugh, like many a gentleman after him, was recusant at the sight of\r\nhis daughter\xe2\x80\x99s luggage; and yet it only loaded one sumpter mule, besides\r\nforming a few bundles which could be easily bestowed upon the saddles of\r\nhis two knappen, while her lute hung by a silken string on her arm.  Both\r\nshe and her aunt thought she had been extremely moderate; but his cry\r\nwas, What could she want with so much?  Her mother had never been allowed\r\nmore than would go into a pair of saddle-bags; and his own Jungfrau\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nhad never seen so much gear together in her life; he would be laughed to\r\nscorn for his presumption in bringing such a fine lady into the castle;\r\nit would be well if Freiherr Eberhard\xe2\x80\x99s bride brought half as much.\r\n\r\nStill he had a certain pride in it\xe2\x80\x94he was, after all, by birth and\r\nbreeding a burgher\xe2\x80\x94and there had been evidently a softening and\r\ncivilizing influence in the night spent beneath his paternal roof, and\r\nold habits, and perhaps likewise in the submission he had met with from\r\nhis daughter.  The attendants, too, who had been pleased with their\r\nquarters, readily undertook to carry their share of the burthen, and,\r\nthough he growled and muttered a little, he at length was won over to\r\nconsent, chiefly, as it seemed, by Christina\xe2\x80\x99s obliging readiness to\r\nleave behind the bundle that contained her holiday kirtle.\r\n\r\nHe had been spared all needless irritation.  Before his waking, Christina\r\nhad been at the priest\xe2\x80\x99s cell, and had received his last blessings and\r\ncounsels, and she had, on the way back, exchanged her farewells and tears\r\nwith her two dearest friends, Barbara Schmidt, and Regina Grundt,\r\nconfiding to the former her cage of doves, and to the latter the myrtle,\r\nwhich, like every German maiden, she cherished in her window, to supply\r\nher future bridal wreath.  Now pale as death, but so resolutely composed\r\nas to be almost disappointing to her demonstrative aunt, she quietly went\r\nthrough her home partings; while Hausfrau Johanna adjured her father by\r\nall that was sacred to be a true guardian and protector of the child, and\r\nhe could not forbear from a few tormenting auguries about the lanzknecht\r\nson-in-law.  Their effect was to make the good dame more passionate in\r\nher embraces and admonitions to Christina to take care of herself.  She\r\nwould have a mass said every day that Heaven might have a care of her!\r\n\r\nMaster Gottfried was going to ride as far as the confines of the free\r\ncity\xe2\x80\x99s territory, and his round, sleek, cream-coloured palfrey, used to\r\nambling in civic processions, was as great a contrast to raw-boned,\r\nwild-eyed Nibelung, all dappled with misty grey, as was the stately,\r\nsubstantial burgher to his lean, hungry-looking brother, or Dame\r\nJohanna\xe2\x80\x99s dignified, curled, white poodle, which was forcibly withheld\r\nfrom following Christina, to the coarse-bristled, wolfish-looking hound\r\nwho glared at the household pet with angry and contemptuous eyes, and\r\nmade poor Christina\xe2\x80\x99s heart throb with terror whenever it bounded near\r\nher.\r\n\r\nClose to her uncle she kept, as beneath the trellised porches that came\r\ndown from the projecting gables of the burghers\xe2\x80\x99 houses many a well-known\r\nface gazed and nodded, as they took their way through the crooked\r\nstreets, many a beggar or poor widow waved her a blessing.  Out into the\r\nmarket-place, with its clear fountain adorned with arches and statues,\r\npast the rising Dome Kirk, where the swarms of workmen unbonneted to the\r\nmaster-carver, and the reiter paused with an irreverent sneer at the\r\nsmall progress made since he could first remember the building.  How poor\r\nlittle Christina\xe2\x80\x99s soul clung to every cusp of the lacework spire, every\r\narch of the window, each of which she had hailed as an achievement!  The\r\ntears had well-nigh blinded her in a gush of feeling that came on her\r\nunawares, and her mule had his own way as he carried her under the arch\r\nof the tall and beautifully-sculptured bridge tower, and over the noble\r\nbridge across the Danube.\r\n\r\nHer uncle spoke much, low and earnestly, to his brother.  She knew it was\r\nin commendation of her to his care, and an endeavour to impress him with\r\na sense of the kind of protection she would require, and she kept out of\r\nearshot.  It was enough for her to see her uncle still, and feel that his\r\ntenderness was with her, and around her.  But at last he drew his rein.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, my little one, the daughter of my heart, I must bid thee\r\nfarewell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nChristina could not be restrained from springing from her mule, and\r\nkneeling on the grass to receive his blessing, her face hidden in her\r\nhands, that her father might not see her tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe good God bless thee, my child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gottfried, who seldom invoked\r\nthe saints; \xe2\x80\x9cbless thee, and bring thee back in His own good time.  Thou\r\nhast been a good child to us; be so to thine own father.  Do thy work,\r\nand come back to us again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tears rained down his cheeks, as Christina\xe2\x80\x99s head lay on his bosom,\r\nand then with a last kiss he lifted her again on her mule, mounted his\r\nhorse, and turned back to the city, with his servant.\r\n\r\nHugh was merciful enough to let his daughter gaze long after the\r\nretreating figure ere he summoned her on.  All day they rode, at first\r\nthrough meadow lands and then through more broken, open ground, where at\r\nmid-day they halted, and dined upon the plentiful fare with which the\r\nhousemother had provided them, over which Hugh smacked his lips, and\r\nowned that they did live well in the old town!  Could Christina make such\r\nsausages?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot as well as my aunt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, do thy best, and thou wilt win favour with the baron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe evening began to advance, and Christina was very weary, as the purple\r\nmountains that she had long watched with a mixture of fear and hope began\r\nto look more distinct, and the ground was often in abrupt ascents.  Her\r\nfather, without giving space for complaints, hurried her on.  He must\r\nreach the Debateable Ford ere dark.  It was, however, twilight when they\r\ncame to an open space, where, at the foot of thickly forest-clad rising\r\nground, lay an expanse of turf and rich grass, through which a stream\r\nmade its way, standing in a wide tranquil pool as if to rest after its\r\nrough course from the mountains.  Above rose, like a dark wall, crag upon\r\ncrag, peak on peak, in purple masses, blending with the sky; and Hugh,\r\npointing upwards to a turreted point, apparently close above their heads,\r\nwhere a star of light was burning, told her that there was Adlerstein,\r\nand this was the Debateable Ford.\r\n\r\nIn fact, as he explained, while splashing through the shallow expanse,\r\nthe stream had changed its course.  It was the boundary between the lands\r\nof Schlangenwald and Adlerstein, but it had within the last sixty years\r\nburst forth in a flood, and had then declined to return to its own bed,\r\nbut had flowed in a fresh channel to the right of the former one.  The\r\nFreiherren von Adlerstein claimed the ground to the old channel, the\r\nGraffen von Schlangenwald held that the river was the landmark; and the\r\ndispute had a greater importance than seemed explained from the worth of\r\nthe rushy space of ground in question, for this was the passage of the\r\nItalian merchants on their way from Constance, and every load that was\r\noverthrown in the river was regarded as the lawful prey of the noble on\r\nwhose banks the catastrophe befell.\r\n\r\nAny freight of goods was anxiously watched by both nobles, and it was not\r\ntheir fault if no disaster befell the travellers.  Hugh talked of the\r\nSchlangenwald marauders with the bitterness of a deadly feud, but\r\nmanifestly did not breathe freely till his whole convoy were safe across\r\nboth the wet and the dry channel.\r\n\r\nChristina supposed they should now ascend to the castle; but her father\r\nlaughed, saying that the castle was not such a step off as she fancied,\r\nand that they must have daylight for the Eagle\xe2\x80\x99s Stairs.  He led the way\r\nthrough the trees, up ground that she thought mountain already, and\r\nfinally arrived at a miserable little hut, which served the purpose of an\r\ninn.\r\n\r\nHe was received there with much obsequiousness, and was plainly a great\r\nauthority there.  Christina, weary and frightened, descended from her\r\nmule, and was put under the protection of a wild, rough-looking peasant\r\nwoman, who stared at her like something from another world, but at length\r\nshowed her a nook behind a mud partition, where she could spread her\r\nmantle, and at least lie down, and tell her beads unseen, if she could\r\nnot sleep in the stifling, smoky atmosphere, amid the sounds of carousal\r\namong her father and his fellows.\r\n\r\nThe great hound came up and smelt to her.  His outline was so-wolfish,\r\nthat she had nearly screamed: but, more in terror at the men who might\r\nhave helped her than even at the beast, she tried to smooth him with her\r\ntrembling hand, whispered his name of \xe2\x80\x9cFesthold,\xe2\x80\x9d and found him licking\r\nher hand, and wagging his long rough tail.  And he finally lay down at\r\nher feet, as though to protect her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it a sign that good angels will not let me be hurt?\xe2\x80\x9d she thought,\r\nand, wearied out, she slept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nTHE EYRIE\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTINA SOREL awoke to a scene most unlike that which had been wont to\r\nmeet her eyes in her own little wainscoted chamber high in the gabled\r\nfront of her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s house.  It was a time when the imperial free towns\r\nof Germany had advanced nearly as far as those of Italy in civilization,\r\nand had reached a point whence they retrograded grievously during the\r\nThirty Years\xe2\x80\x99 War, even to an extent that they have never entirely\r\nrecovered.  The country immediately around them shared the benefits of\r\ntheir civilization, and the free peasant-proprietors lived in great ease\r\nand prosperity, in beautiful and picturesque farmsteads, enjoying a\r\ncareless abundance, and keeping numerous rural or religious feasts, where\r\nold Teutonic mythological observances had received a Christian colouring\r\nand adaptation.\r\n\r\nIn the mountains, or around the castles, it was usually very different.\r\nThe elective constitution of the empire, the frequent change of dynasty,\r\nthe many disputed successions, had combined to render the sovereign\r\nauthority uncertain and feeble, and it was seldom really felt save in the\r\nhereditary dominions of the Kaiser for the time being.  Thus, while the\r\ncities advanced in the power of self-government, and the education it\r\nconveyed, the nobles, especially those whose abodes were not easily\r\naccessible, were often practically under no government at all, and felt\r\nthemselves accountable to no man.  The old wild freedom of the Suevi, and\r\nother Teutonic tribes, still technically, and in many cases practically,\r\nexisted.  The Heretogen, Heerzogen, or, as we call them, Dukes, had\r\nindeed accepted employment from the Kaiser as his generals, and had\r\nreceived rewards from him; the Gerefen, or Graffen, of all kinds were his\r\njudges, the titles of both being proofs of their holding commissions\r\nfrom, and being thus dependent on, the court.  But the Freiherren, a word\r\nvery inadequately represented by our French term of baron, were\r\nabsolutely free, \xe2\x80\x9cnever in bondage to any man,\xe2\x80\x9d holding their own, and\r\nowing no duty, no office; poorer, because unendowed by the royal\r\nauthority, but holding themselves infinitely higher, than the pensioners\r\nof the court.  Left behind, however, by their neighbours, who did their\r\npart by society, and advanced with it, the Freiherren had been for the\r\nmost part obliged to give up their independence and fall into the system,\r\nbut so far in the rear, that they ranked, like the barons of France and\r\nEngland, as the last order of nobility.\r\n\r\nStill, however, in the wilder and more mountainous parts of the country,\r\nsome of the old families of unreduced, truly free Freiherren lingered,\r\ntheir hand against every man, every man\xe2\x80\x99s hand against them, and ever\r\nbecoming more savage, both positively and still more proportionately, as\r\ntheir isolation and the general progress around them became greater.  The\r\nHouse of Austria, by gradually absorbing hereditary states into its own\r\npossessions, was, however, in the fifteenth century, acquiring a\r\npreponderance that rendered its possession of the imperial throne almost\r\na matter of inheritance, and moreover rendered the supreme power far more\r\neffective than it had ever previously been.  Freidrich III. a man still\r\nin full vigour, and with an able and enterprising son already elected to\r\nthe succession, was making his rule felt, and it was fast becoming\r\napparent that the days of the independent baronies were numbered, and\r\nthat the only choice that would soon be left them would be between making\r\nterms and being forcibly reduced.  Von Adlerstein was one of the oldest\r\nof these free families.  If the lords of the Eagle\xe2\x80\x99s Stone had ever\r\nfollowed the great Konrads and Freidrichs of Swabia in their imperial\r\ndays, their descendants had taken care to forget the weakness, and\r\nbelieved themselves absolutely free from all allegiance.\r\n\r\nAnd the wildness of their territory was what might be expected from their\r\nhostility to all outward influences.  The hostel, if it deserved the\r\nname, was little more than a charcoal-burner\xe2\x80\x99s hut, hidden in the woods\r\nat the foot of the mountain, serving as a halting-place for the\r\nFreiherren\xe2\x80\x99s retainers ere they attempted the ascent.  The inhabitants\r\nwere allowed to ply their trade of charring wood in the forest on\r\ncondition of supplying the castle with charcoal, and of affording a\r\nlodging to the followers on occasions like the present.\r\n\r\nGrimy, half-clad, and brawny, with the whites of his eyes gleaming out of\r\nhis black face, Jobst the Kohler startled Christina terribly when she\r\ncame into the outer room, and met him returning from his night\xe2\x80\x99s work,\r\nwith his long stoking-pole in his hand.  Her father shouted with laughter\r\nat her alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou thinkest thyself in the land of the kobolds and dwarfs, my girl!\r\nNever mind, thou wilt see worse than honest Jobst before thou hast done.\r\nNow, eat a morsel and be ready\xe2\x80\x94mountain air will make thee hungry ere\r\nthou art at the castle.  And, hark thee, Jobst, thou must give\r\nstable-room to yon sumpter-mule for the present, and let some of my\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s gear lie in the shed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO father!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Christina, in dismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll bring it up, child, by piecemeal,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cas we\r\ncan; but if such a freight came to the castle at once, my lady would have\r\nher claws on it, and little more wouldst thou ever see thereof.\r\nMoreover, I shall have enough to do to look after thee up the ascent,\r\nwithout another of these city-bred beasts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope the poor mule will be well cared for.  I can pay for\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d began\r\nChristina; but her father squeezed her arm, and drowned her soft voice in\r\nhis loud tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJobst will take care of the beast, as belonging to me.  Woe betide him,\r\nif I find it the worse!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and his added imprecations seemed unnecessary,\r\nso earnest were the asseverations of both the man and his wife that the\r\nanimal should be well cared for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook you, Christina,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hugh Sorel, as soon as he had placed her on\r\nher mule, and led her out of hearing, \xe2\x80\x9cif thou hast any gold about thee,\r\nlet it be the last thing thou ownest to any living creature up there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThen, as she was about to speak\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDo not even tell me.  I _will_ not\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d  The caution did not add much to Christina\xe2\x80\x99s comfort; but she\r\npresently asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is thy steed, father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sent him up to the castle with the Schneiderlein and Yellow Lorentz,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nanswered the father.  \xe2\x80\x9cI shall have ado enough on foot with thee before\r\nwe are up the Ladder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe father and daughter were meantime proceeding along a dark path\r\nthrough oak and birch woods, constantly ascending, until the oak grew\r\nstunted and disappeared, and the opening glades showed steep, stony,\r\ntorrent-furrowed ramparts of hillside above them, looking to Christina\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes as if she were set to climb up the cathedral side like a snail or a\r\nfly.  She quite gasped for breath at the very sight, and was told in\r\nreturn to wait and see what she would yet say to the Adlerstreppe, or\r\nEagle\xe2\x80\x99s Ladder.  Poor child! she had no raptures for romantic scenery;\r\nshe knew that jagged peaks made very pretty backgrounds in illuminations,\r\nbut she had much rather have been in the smooth meadows of the environs\r\nof Ulm.  The Danube looked much more agreeable to her, silver-winding\r\nbetween its green banks, than did the same waters leaping down with noisy\r\nvoices in their stony, worn beds to feed the river that she only knew in\r\nhis grave breadth and majesty.  Yet, alarmed as she was, there was\r\nsomething in the exhilaration and elasticity of the mountain air that\r\ngave her an entirely new sensation of enjoyment and life, and seemed to\r\nbrace her limbs and spirits for whatever might be before her; and,\r\nwilling to show herself ready to be gratified, she observed on the\r\nfreshness and sweetness of the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou find\xe2\x80\x99st it out, child?  Ay, \xe2\x80\x99tis worth all the feather-beds and\r\npouncet-boxes in Ulm; is it not?  That accursed Italian fever never left\r\nme till I came up here.  A man can scarce draw breath in your foggy\r\nmeadows below there.  Now then, here is the view open.  What think you of\r\nthe Eagle\xe2\x80\x99s Nest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor, having passed beyond the region of wood they had come forth upon the\r\nmountain-side.  A not immoderately steep slope of boggy, mossy-looking\r\nground covered with bilberries, cranberries, &c. and with bare rocks here\r\nand there rising, went away above out of her ken; but the path she was\r\nupon turned round the shoulder of the mountain, and to the left, on a\r\nledge of rock cut off apparently on their side by a deep ravine, and with\r\na sheer precipice above and below it, stood a red stone pile, with one\r\nturret far above the rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is Schloss Adlerstein?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is Schloss Adlerstein; and there shalt thou be in two hours\xe2\x80\x99 time,\r\nunless the devil be more than usually busy, or thou mak\xe2\x80\x99st a fool of\r\nthyself.  If so, not Satan himself could save thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was well that Christina had resolution to prevent her making a fool of\r\nherself on the spot, for the thought of the pathway turned her so dizzy\r\nthat she could only shut her eyes, trusting that her father did not see\r\nher terror.  Soon the turn round to the side of the mountain was made,\r\nand the road became a mere track worn out on the turf on the hillside,\r\nwith an abyss beneath, close to the edge of which the mule, of course,\r\nwalked.\r\n\r\nWhen she ventured to look again, she perceived that the ravine was like\r\nan enormous crack open on the mountain-side, and that the stream that\r\nformed the Debateable Ford flowed down the bottom of it.  The ravine\r\nitself went probably all the way up the mountain, growing shallower as it\r\nascended higher; but here, where Christina beheld it, it was extremely\r\ndeep, and savagely desolate and bare.  She now saw that the Eagle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nLadder was a succession of bare gigantic terraces of rock, of which the\r\nopposite side of the ravine was composed, and on one of which stood the\r\ncastle.  It was no small mystery to her how it had ever been built, or\r\nhow she was ever to get there.  She saw in the opening of the ravine the\r\ngreen meadows and woods far below; and, when her father pointed out to\r\nher the Debateable Ford, apparently much nearer to the castle than they\r\nthemselves were at present, she asked why they had so far overpassed the\r\ncastle, and come by this circuitous course.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hugh, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are not eagles outright.  Seest thou not, just\r\nbeyond the castle court, this whole crag of ours breaks off short, falls\r\nlike the town wall straight down into the plain?  Even this cleft that we\r\nare crossing by, the only road a horse can pass, breaks off short and\r\nsudden too, so that the river is obliged to take leaps which nought else\r\nbut a chamois could compass.  A footpath there is, and Freiherr Eberhard\r\ntakes it at all times, being born to it; but even I am too stiff for the\r\nlike.  Ha! ha!  Thy uncle may talk of the Kaiser and his League, but he\r\nwould change his note if we had him here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet castles have been taken by hunger,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, knowest thou so much?\xe2\x80\x94True!  But look you,\xe2\x80\x9d pointing to a white\r\nfoamy thread that descended the opposite steeps, \xe2\x80\x9cyonder beck dashes\r\nthrough the castle court, and it never dries; and see you the ledge the\r\ncastle stands on?  It winds on out of your sight, and forms a path which\r\nleads to the village of Adlerstein, out on the other slope of the\r\nmountains; and ill were it for the serfs if they victualled not the\r\ncastle well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fearful steepness of the ground absorbed all Christina\xe2\x80\x99s attention.\r\nThe road, or rather stairs, came down to the stream at the bottom of the\r\nfissure, and then went again on the other side up still more tremendous\r\nsteeps, which Hugh climbed with a staff, sometimes with his hand on the\r\nbridle, but more often only keeping a watchful eye on the sure-footed\r\nmule, and an arm to steady his daughter in the saddle when she grew\r\nabsolutely faint with giddiness at the abyss around her.  She was too\r\nmuch in awe of him to utter cry or complaint, and, when he saw her effort\r\nto subdue her mortal terror, he was far from unkind, and let her feel his\r\nprotecting strength.\r\n\r\nPresently a voice was heard above\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Sorel, hast brought her!\r\nTrudchen is wearying for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words were in the most boorish dialect and pronunciation, the\r\nstranger to Christina\xe2\x80\x99s ears, because intercourse with foreign merchants,\r\nand a growing affectation of Latinism, had much refined the city language\r\nto which she was accustomed; and she was surprised to perceive by her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s gesture and address that the speaker must be one of the lords of\r\nthe castle.  She looked up, and saw on the pathway above her a tall,\r\nlarge-framed young man, his skin dyed red with sun and wind, in odd\r\ncontrast with his pale shaggy hair, moustache, and beard, as though the\r\nweather had tanned the one and bleached the other.  His dress was a still\r\nshabbier buff suit than her father had worn, but with a\r\nrichly-embroidered belt sustaining a hunting-horn with finely-chased\r\nornaments of tarnished silver, and an eagle\xe2\x80\x99s plume was fastened into his\r\ncap with a large gold Italian coin.  He stared hard at the maiden, but\r\nvouchsafed her no token of greeting\xe2\x80\x94only distressed her considerably by\r\ndistracting her father\xe2\x80\x99s attention from her mule by his questions about\r\nthe journey, all in the same rude, coarse tone and phraseology.  Some\r\namount of illusion was dispelled.  Christina was quite prepared to find\r\nthe mountain lords dangerous ruffians, but she had expected the graces of\r\ncourtesy and high birth; but, though there was certainly an air of\r\ncommand and freedom of bearing about the present specimen, his manners\r\nand speech were more uncouth than those of any newly-caught apprentice of\r\nher uncle, and she could not help thinking that her good aunt Johanna\r\nneed not have troubled herself about the danger of her taking a liking to\r\nany such young Freiherr as she here beheld.\r\n\r\nBy this time a last effort of the mule had climbed to the level of the\r\ncastle.  As her father had shown her, there was precipice on two sides of\r\nthe building; on the third, a sheer wall of rock going up to a huge\r\nheight before it reached another of the Eagle\xe2\x80\x99s Steps; and on the fourth,\r\nwhere the gateway was, the little beck had been made to flow in a deep\r\nchannel that had been hollowed out to serve as a moat, before it bounded\r\ndown to swell the larger water-course in the ravine.  A temporary bridge\r\nhad been laid across; the drawbridge was out of order, and part of Hugh\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbusiness had been to procure materials for mending its apparatus.\r\nChristina was told to dismount and cross on foot.  The unrailed board, so\r\nclose to the abyss, and with the wild water foaming above and below, was\r\ndreadful to her; and, though she durst not speak, she hung back with an\r\ninvoluntary shudder, as her father, occupied with the mule, did not think\r\nof giving her a hand.  The young baron burst out into an unrestrained\r\nlaugh\xe2\x80\x94a still greater shock to her feelings; but at the same time he\r\nroughly took her hand, and almost dragged her across, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cCity\r\nbred\xe2\x80\x94ho, ho!\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cThanks, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she strove to say, but she was very near\r\nweeping with the terror and strangeness of all around.\r\n\r\nThe low-browed gateway, barely high enough to admit a man on horseback,\r\nopened before her, almost to her feelings like the gate of the grave, and\r\nshe could not help crossing herself, with a silent prayer for protection,\r\nas she stepped under it, and came into the castle court\xe2\x80\x94not such a court\r\nas gave its name to fair courtesy, but, if truth must be told, far more\r\nresembling an ill-kept, ill-savoured stable-yard, with the piggeries\r\nopening into it.  In unpleasantly close quarters, the Schneiderlein, or\r\nlittle tailor, _i.e._ the biggest and fiercest of all the knappen, was\r\ngrooming Nibelung; three long-backed, long-legged, frightful swine were\r\ngrubbing in a heap of refuse; four or five gaunt ferocious-looking dogs\r\ncame bounding up to greet their comrade Festhold; and a great old\r\nlong-bearded goat stood on the top of the mixen, looking much disposed to\r\nbutt at any newcomer.  The Sorel family had brought cleanliness from\r\nFlanders, and Hausfrau Johanna was scrupulously dainty in all her\r\nappointments.  Christina scarcely knew how she conveyed herself and her\r\nblue kirtle across the bemired stones to the next and still darker\r\nportal, under which a wide but rough ill-hewn stair ascended.  The\r\nstables, in fact, occupied the lower floor of the main building, and not\r\ntill these stairs had ascended above them did they lead out into the\r\ncastle hall.  Here were voices\xe2\x80\x94voices rude and harsh, like those\r\nChristina had shrunk from in passing drinking booths.  There was a long\r\ntable, with rough men-at-arms lounging about, and staring rudely at her;\r\nand at the upper end, by a great open chimney, sat, half-dozing, an\r\nelderly man, more rugged in feature than his son; and yet, when he roused\r\nhimself and spoke to Hugh, there was a shade more of breeding, and less\r\nof clownishness in his voice and deportment, as if he had been less\r\nentirely devoid of training.  A tall darkly-robed woman stood beside\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94it was her harsh tone of reproof and command that had so startled\r\nChristina as she entered\xe2\x80\x94and her huge towering cap made her look gigantic\r\nin the dim light of the smoky hall.  Her features had been handsome, but\r\nhad become hardened into a grim wooden aspect; and with sinking spirits\r\nChristina paused at the step of the da\xc3\xafs, and made her reverence, wishing\r\nshe could sink beneath the stones of the pavement out of sight of these\r\nterrible personages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that\xe2\x80\x99s the wench you have taken all this trouble for,\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nFreiherrinn Kunigunde\xe2\x80\x99s greeting.  \xe2\x80\x9cShe looks like another sick baby to\r\nnurse; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll have no trouble about her;\xe2\x80\x94that is all.  Take her up to\r\nErmentrude; and thou, girl, have a care thou dost her will, and puttest\r\nnone of thy city fancies into her head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd hark thee, girl,\xe2\x80\x9d added the old Freiherr, sitting up.  \xe2\x80\x9cSo thou\r\ncanst nurse her well, thou shalt have a new gown and a stout husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat way,\xe2\x80\x9d pointed the lady towards one of the four corner towers; and\r\nChristina moved doubtfully towards it, reluctant to quit her father, her\r\nonly protector, and afraid to introduce herself.  The younger Freiherr,\r\nhowever, stepped before her, went striding two or three steps at a time\r\nup the turret stair, and, before Christina had wound her way up, she\r\nheard a thin, impatient voice say, \xe2\x80\x9cThou saidst she was come, Ebbo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, even so,\xe2\x80\x9d she heard Freiherr Eberhard return; \xe2\x80\x9cbut she is slow and\r\ntown-bred.  She was afraid of crossing the moat.\xe2\x80\x9d  And then both laughed,\r\nso that Christina\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks tingled as she emerged from the turret into\r\nanother vaulted room.  \xe2\x80\x9cHere she is,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth the brother; \xe2\x80\x9cnow will she\r\nmake thee quite well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a very bare and desolate room, with no hangings to the rough stone\r\nwalls, and scarcely any furniture, except a great carved bedstead, one\r\nwooden chair, a table, and some stools.  On the bare floor, in front of\r\nthe fire, her arm under her head, and a profusion of long hair falling\r\nround her like flax from a distaff, lay wearily a little figure, beside\r\nwhom Sir Eberhard was kneeling on one knee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is my sisterling,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, looking up to the newcomer.  \xe2\x80\x9cThey say\r\nyou burgher women have ways of healing the sick.  Look at her.  Think you\r\nyou can heal her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn an excess of dumb shyness Ermentrude half rose, and effectually\r\nhindered any observations on her looks by hiding her face away upon her\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s knee.  It was the gesture of a child of five years old, but\r\nErmentrude\xe2\x80\x99s length of limb forbade Christina to suppose her less than\r\nfourteen or fifteen.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, wilt not look at her?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, trying to\r\nraise her head; and then, holding out one of her wasted, feverish hands\r\nto Christina, he again asked, with a wistfulness that had a strange\r\neffect from the large, tall man, almost ten years her elder, \xe2\x80\x9cCanst thou\r\ncure her, maiden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am no doctor, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Christina; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I could, at least, make\r\nher more comfortable.  The stone is too hard for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not go away; I want the fire,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the sick girl, holding\r\nout her hands towards it, and shivering.\r\n\r\nChristina quickly took off her own thick cloth mantle, well lined with\r\ndressed lambskins, laid it on the floor, rolled the collar of it over a\r\nsmall log of wood\xe2\x80\x94the only substitute she could see for a pillow\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nshowed an inviting couch in an instant.  Ermentrude let her brother lay\r\nher down, and then was covered with the ample fold.  She smiled as she\r\nturned up her thin, wasted face, faded into the same whitey-brown tint as\r\nher hair.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat is good,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, but without thanks; and, feeling the\r\nsoft lambswool: \xe2\x80\x9cIs that what you burgher-women wear?  Father is to give\r\nme a furred mantle, if only some court dame would pass the Debateable\r\nFord.  But the Schlangenwaldern got the last before ever we could get\r\ndown.  Jobst was so stupid.  He did not give us warning in time; but he\r\nis to be hanged next time if he does not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristina\xe2\x80\x99s blood curdled as she heard this speech in a weak little\r\ncomplaining tone, that otherwise put her sadly in mind of Barbara\r\nSchmidt\xe2\x80\x99s little sister, who had pined and wasted to death.  \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\r\nTrudchen,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the brother kindly; \xe2\x80\x9cmeantime I have kept all the\r\nwild catskins for thee, and may be this\xe2\x80\x94this\xe2\x80\x94_she_ could sew them up into\r\na mantle for thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO let me see,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young lady eagerly; and Sir Eberhard, walking\r\noff, presently returned with an armful of the beautiful brindled furs of\r\nthe mountain cat, reminding Christina of her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s gentle domestic\r\nfavourite.  Ermentrude sat up, and regarded the placing out of them with\r\ngreat interest; and thus her brother left her employed, and so much\r\ndelighted that she had not flagged, when a great bell proclaimed that it\r\nwas the time for the noontide meal, for which Christina, in spite of all\r\nher fears of the company below stairs, had been constrained by mountain\r\nair to look forward with satisfaction.\r\n\r\nErmentrude, she found, meant to go down, but with no notion of the\r\npersonal arrangements that Christina had been wont to think a needful\r\npreliminary.  With all her hair streaming, down she went, and was so\r\ngladly welcomed by her father that it was plain that her presence was\r\nregarded as an unusual advance towards recovery, and Christina feared\r\nlest he might already be looking out for the stout husband.  She had much\r\nto tell him about the catskin cloak, and then she was seized with eager\r\ncuriosity at the sight of Christina\xe2\x80\x99s bundles, and especially at her\r\nlute, which she must hear at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot now,\xe2\x80\x9d said her mother, \xe2\x80\x9cthere will be jangling and jingling enough\r\nby and by\xe2\x80\x94meat now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe whole establishment were taking their places\xe2\x80\x94or rather tumbling into\r\nthem.  A battered, shapeless metal vessel seemed to represent the\r\nsalt-cellar, and next to it Hugh Sorel seated himself, and kept a place\r\nfor her beside him.  Otherwise she would hardly have had seat or food.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nShe was now able to survey the inmates of the castle.  Besides the family\r\nthemselves, there were about a dozen men, all ruffianly-looking, and of\r\nmuch lower grade than her father, and three women.  One, old Ursel, the\r\nwife of Hatto the forester, was a bent, worn, but not ill-looking woman,\r\nwith a motherly face; the younger ones were hard, bold creatures, from\r\nwhom Christina felt a shrinking recoil.  The meal was dressed by Ursel\r\nand her kitchen boy.  From a great cauldron, goat\xe2\x80\x99s flesh and broth\r\ntogether were ladled out into wooden bowls.  That every one provided\r\ntheir own spoon and knife\xe2\x80\x94no fork\xe2\x80\x94was only what Christina was used to in\r\nthe most refined society, and she had the implements in a pouch hanging\r\nto her girdle; but she was not prepared for the unwashed condition of the\r\nbowls, nor for being obliged to share that of her father\xe2\x80\x94far less for the\r\nabsence of all blessing on the meal, and the coarse boisterousness of\r\nmanners prevailing thereat.  Hungry as she was, she did not find it easy\r\nto take food under these circumstances, and she was relieved when\r\nErmentrude, overcome by the turmoil, grew giddy, and was carried upstairs\r\nby her father, who laid her down upon her great bed, and left her to the\r\nattendance of Christina.  Ursel had followed, but was petulantly repulsed\r\nby her young lady in favour of the newcomer, and went away grumbling.\r\n\r\nNestled on her bed, Ermentrude insisted on hearing the lute, and\r\nChristina had to creep down to fetch it, with some other of her goods, in\r\ntrembling haste, and redoubled disgust at the aspect of the meal, which\r\nlooked even more repulsive in this later stage, and to one who was no\r\nlonger partaking of it.\r\n\r\nLow and softly, with a voice whence she could scarcely banish tears, and\r\nin dread of attracting attention, Christina sung to the sick girl, who\r\nlistened with a sort of rude wonder, and finally was lulled to sleep.\r\nChristina ventured to lay down her instrument and move towards the\r\nwindow, heavily mullioned with stone, barred with iron, and glazed with\r\nthick glass; being in fact the only glazed window in the castle.  To her\r\ngreat satisfaction it did not look out over the loathsome court, but over\r\nthe opening of the ravine.  The apartment occupied the whole floor of the\r\nkeep; it was stone-paved, but the roof was boarded, and there was a round\r\nturret at each angle.  One contained the staircase, and was that which\r\nran up above the keep, served as a watch-tower, and supported the Eagle\r\nbanner.  The other three were empty, and one of these, which had a strong\r\ndoor, and a long loophole window looking out over the open country,\r\nChristina hoped that she might appropriate.  The turret was immediately\r\nover the perpendicular cliff that descended into the plain.  A stone\r\nthrown from the window would have gone straight down, she knew not where.\r\nClose to her ears rushed the descending waterfall in its leap over the\r\nrock side, and her eyes could rest themselves on the green meadow land\r\nbelow, and the smooth water of the Debateable Ford; nay\xe2\x80\x94far, far away\r\nbeyond retreating ridges of wood and field\xe2\x80\x94she thought she could track a\r\nsilver line and, guided by it, a something that might be a city.  Her\r\nheart leapt towards it, but she was recalled by Ermentrude\xe2\x80\x99s fretfully\r\nimperious voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was only looking forth from the window, lady,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, returning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! thou saw\xe2\x80\x99st no travellers at the Ford?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ermentrude, starting\r\nup with lively interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, lady; I was gazing at the far distance.  Know you if it be indeed\r\nUlm that we see from these windows?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUlm?  That is where thou comest from?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ermentrude languidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy happy home, with my dear uncle and aunt!  O, if I can but see it\r\nhence, it will be joy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know.  Let me see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ermentrude, rising; but at the window\r\nher pale blue eyes gazed vacantly as if she did not know what she was\r\nlooking at or for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! if the steeple of the Dome Kirk were but finished, I could not\r\nmistake it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina.  \xe2\x80\x9cHow beauteous the white spire will look\r\nfrom hence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDome Kirk?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Ermentrude; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch an entire blank as the poor child\xe2\x80\x99s mind seemed to be was\r\ninconceivable to the maiden, who had been bred up in the busy hum of men,\r\nwhere the constant resort of strange merchants, the daily interests of a\r\nself-governing municipality, and the numerous festivals, both secular and\r\nreligious, were an unconscious education, even without that which had\r\nbeen bestowed upon her by teachers, as well as by her companionship with\r\nher uncle, and participation in his studies, taste and arts.\r\n\r\nErmentrude von Adlerstein had, on the contrary, not only never gone\r\nbeyond the Kohler\xe2\x80\x99s hut on the one side, and the mountain village on the\r\nother, but she never seen more of life than the festival at the wake the\r\nhermitage chapel there on Midsummer-day.  The only strangers who ever\r\ncame to the castle were disbanded lanzknechts who took service with her\r\nfather, or now and then a captive whom he put to ransom.  She knew\r\nabsolutely nothing of the world, except for a general belief that\r\nFreiherren lived there to do what they chose with other people, and that\r\nthe House of Adlerstein was the freest and noblest in existence.  Also\r\nthere was a very positive hatred to the house of Schlangenwald, and no\r\nless to that of Adlerstein Wildschloss, for no reason that Christina\r\ncould discover save that, being a younger branch of the family, they had\r\nsubmitted to the Emperor.  To destroy either the Graf von Schlangenwald,\r\nor her Wildschloss cousin, was evidently the highest gratification\r\nErmentrude could conceive; and, for the rest, that her father and brother\r\nshould make successful captures at the Debateable Ford was the more\r\nabiding, because more practicable hope.  She had no further ideas, except\r\nperhaps to elude her mother\xe2\x80\x99s severity, and to desire her brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuccess in chamois-hunting.  The only mental culture she had ever\r\nreceived was that old Ursel had taught her the Credo, Pater Noster, and\r\nAve, as correctly as might be expected from a long course of traditionary\r\nrepetitions of an incomprehensible language.  And she knew besides a few\r\nGerman rhymes and jingles, half Christian, half heathen, with a legend or\r\ntwo which, if the names were Christian, ran grossly wild from all\r\nChristian meaning or morality.  As to the amenities, nay, almost the\r\nproprieties, of life, they were less known in that baronial castle than\r\nin any artisan\xe2\x80\x99s house at Ulm.  So little had the sick girl figured them\r\nto herself, that she did not even desire any greater means of ease than\r\nshe possessed.  She moaned and fretted indeed, with aching limbs and\r\nblank weariness, but without the slightest formed desire for anything to\r\nremove her discomfort, except the few ameliorations she knew, such as\r\nsitting on her brother\xe2\x80\x99s knee, with her head on his shoulder, or tasting\r\nthe mountain berries that he gathered for her.  Any other desire she\r\nexerted herself to frame was for finery to be gained from the spoils of\r\ntravellers.\r\n\r\nAnd this was Christina\xe2\x80\x99s charge, whom she must look upon as the least\r\nalien spirit in this dreadful castle of banishment!  The young and old\r\nlords seemed to her savage bandits, who frightened her only less than did\r\nthe proud sinister expression of the old lady, for she had not even the\r\nmerit of showing any tenderness towards the sickly girl, of whom she was\r\nashamed, and evidently regarded the town-bred attendant as a contemptible\r\ninterloper.\r\n\r\nLong, long did the maiden weep and pray that night after Ermentrude had\r\nsunk to sleep.  She strained her eyes with home-sick longings to detect\r\nlights where she thought Ulm might be; and, as she thought of her uncle\r\nand aunt, the poodle and the cat round the stove, the maids spinning and\r\nthe prentices knitting as her uncle read aloud some grave good book, most\r\nprobably the legend of the saint of the day, and contrasted it with the\r\nrude gruff sounds of revelry that found their way up the turret stairs,\r\nshe could hardly restrain her sobs from awakening the young lady whose\r\nbed she was to share.  She thought almost with envy of her own patroness,\r\nwho was cast into the lake of Bolsena with a millstone about her neck\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nbetter fate, thought she, than to live on in such an abode of\r\nloathsomeness and peril.\r\n\r\nBut then had not St. Christina floated up alive, bearing up her millstone\r\nwith her?  And had not she been put into a dungeon full of venomous\r\nreptiles who, when they approached her, had all been changed to harmless\r\ndoves?  Christina had once asked Father Balthazar how this could be; and\r\nhad he not replied that the Church did not teach these miracles as\r\nmatters of faith, but that she might there discern in figure how meek\r\nChristian holiness rose above all crushing burthens, and transformed the\r\nrudest natures.  This poor maiden-dying, perhaps; and oh! how unfit to\r\nlive or die!\xe2\x80\x94might it be her part to do some good work by her, and infuse\r\nsome Christian hope, some godly fear?  Could it be for this that the\r\nsaints had led her hither?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nTHE FLOTSAM AND JETSAM OF THE DEBATEABLE FORD\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE in Schloss Adlerstein was little less intolerable than Christina\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimagination had depicted it.  It was entirely devoid of all the graces of\r\nchivalry, and its squalor and coarseness, magnified into absurdity by\r\nhaughtiness and violence, were almost inconceivable.  Fortunately for\r\nher, the inmates of the castle resided almost wholly below stairs in the\r\nhall and kitchen, and in some dismal dens in the thickness of their\r\nwalls.  The height of the keep was intended for dignity and defence,\r\nrather than for habitation; and the upper chamber, with its great\r\nstate-bed, where everybody of the house of Adlerstein was born and died,\r\nwas not otherwise used, except when Ermentrude, unable to bear the\r\noppressive confusion below stairs, had escaped thither for quietness\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsake.  No one else wished to inhabit it.  The chamber above was filled\r\nwith the various appliances for the defence of the castle; and no one\r\nwould have ever gone up the turret stairs had not a warder been usually\r\nkept on the roof to watch the roads leading to the Ford.  Otherwise the\r\nAdlersteiners had all the savage instinct of herding together in as small\r\na space as possible.\r\n\r\nFreiherrin Kunigunde hardly ever mounted to her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s chamber.  All\r\nher affection was centred on the strong and manly son, of whom she was\r\nproud, while the sickly pining girl, who would hardly find a mate of her\r\nown rank, and who had not even dowry enough for a convent, was such a\r\nshame and burthen to her as to be almost a distasteful object.  But\r\nperversely, as it seemed to her, the only daughter was the darling of\r\nboth father and brother, who were ready to do anything to gratify the\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s sick fancies, and hailed with delight her pleasure in her new\r\nattendant.  Old Ursel was at first rather envious and contemptuous of the\r\nchildish, fragile stranger, but her gentleness disarmed the old woman;\r\nand, when it was plain that the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s sufferings were greatly\r\nlessened by tender care, dislike gave way to attachment, and there was\r\nlittle more murmuring at the menial services that were needed by the two\r\nmaidens, even when Ermentrude\xe2\x80\x99s feeble fancies, or Christina\xe2\x80\x99s views of\r\ndainty propriety, rendered them more onerous than before.  She was even\r\nheard to rejoice that some Christian care and tenderness had at last\r\nreached her poor neglected child.\r\n\r\nIt was well for Christina that she had such an ally.  The poor child\r\nnever crept down stairs to the dinner or supper, to fetch food for\r\nErmentrude, or water for herself, without a trembling and shrinking of\r\nheart and nerves.  Her father\xe2\x80\x99s authority guarded her from rude actions,\r\nbut from rough tongues he neither could nor would guard her, nor\r\nunderstand that what to some would have been a compliment seemed to her\r\nan alarming insult; and her chief safeguard lay in her own insignificance\r\nand want of attraction, and still more in the modesty that concealed her\r\nterror at rude jests sufficiently to prevent frightening her from\r\nbecoming an entertainment.\r\n\r\nHer father, whom she looked on as a cultivated person in comparison with\r\nthe rest of the world, did his best for her after his own views, and\r\ngradually brought her all the properties she had left at the Kohler\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhut.  Therewith she made a great difference in the aspect of the chamber,\r\nunder the full sanction of the lords of the castle.  Wolf, deer, and\r\nsheep skins abounded; and with these, assisted by her father and old\r\nHatto, she tapestried the lower part of the bare grim walls, a great\r\nbear\xe2\x80\x99s hide covered the neighbourhood of the hearth, and cushions were\r\nmade of these skins, and stuffed from Ursel\xe2\x80\x99s stores of feathers.  All\r\nthese embellishments were watched with great delight by Ermentrude, who\r\nhad never been made of so much importance, and was as much surprised as\r\nrelieved by such attentions.  She was too young and too delicate to\r\nreject civilization, and she let Christina braid her hair, bathe her, and\r\narrange her dress, with sensations of comfort that were almost like\r\nhealth.  To train her into occupying herself was however, as Christina\r\nsoon found, in her present state, impossible.  She could spin and sew a\r\nlittle, but hated both; and her clumsy, listless fingers only soiled and\r\nwasted Christina\xe2\x80\x99s needles, silk, and lute strings, and such damage was\r\nnot so easily remedied as in the streets of Ulm.  She was best provided\r\nfor when looking on at her attendant\xe2\x80\x99s busy hands, and asking to be sung\r\nto, or to hear tales of the active, busy scenes of the city life\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ndresses, fairs, festivals, and guild processions.\r\n\r\n[Picture: \xe2\x80\x9cShe was too young and too delicate to reject civilization, and\r\n she let Christina braid her hair, bathe her, and arrange her dress, with\r\n      sensations of comfort that were almost like health.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Page 37]\r\n\r\nThe gentle nursing and the new interests made her improve in health, so\r\nthat her father was delighted, and Christina began to hope for a return\r\nhome.  Sometimes the two girls would take the air, either, on still days,\r\nupon the battlements, where Ermentrude watched the Debateable Ford, and\r\nChristina gazed at the Danube and at Ulm; or they would find their way to\r\na grassy nook on the mountain-side, where Christina gathered gentians and\r\nsaxifrage, trying to teach her young lady that they were worth looking\r\nat, and sighing at the thought of Master Gottfried\xe2\x80\x99s wreath when she met\r\nwith the asphodel seed-vessels.  Once the quiet mule was brought into\r\nrequisition; and, with her brother walking by her, and Sorel and his\r\ndaughter in attendance, Ermentrude rode towards the village of\r\nAdlerstein.  It was a collection of miserable huts, on a sheltered slope\r\ntowards the south, where there was earth enough to grow some wretched rye\r\nand buckwheat, subject to severe toll from the lord of the soil.  Perched\r\non a hollow rock above the slope was a rude little church, over a cave\r\nwhere a hermit had once lived and died in such odour of sanctity that,\r\nhis day happening to coincide with that of St. John the Baptist, the\r\nBlessed Freidmund had acquired the credit of the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share both of the\r\nsaint\xe2\x80\x99s honours and of the old solstitial feast of Midsummer.  This wake\r\nwas the one gaiety of the year, and attracted a fair which was the sole\r\noccasion of coming honestly by anything from the outer world; nor had his\r\ncell ever lacked a professional anchorite.\r\n\r\nThe Freiherr of his day had been a devout man, who had gone a pilgrimage\r\nwith Kaiser Friedrich of the Red Beard, and had brought home a bit of\r\nstone from the council chamber of Nic\xc3\xa6a, which he had presented to the\r\nlittle church that he had built over the cavern.  He had named his son\r\nFriedmund; and there were dim memories of his days as of a golden age,\r\nbefore the Wildschlossen had carried off the best of the property, and\r\nwhen all went well.\r\n\r\nThis was Christina\xe2\x80\x99s first sight of a church since her arrival, except\r\nthat in the chapel, which was a dismal neglected vault, where a ruinous\r\naltar and mouldering crucifix testified to its sacred purpose.  The old\r\nbaron had been excommunicated for twenty years, ever since he had harried\r\nthe wains of the Bishop of Augsburg on his way to the Diet; and, though\r\nhis household and family were not under the same sentence, \xe2\x80\x9cSunday didna\r\ncome abune the pass.\xe2\x80\x9d  Christina\xe2\x80\x99s entreaty obtained permission to enter\r\nthe little building, but she had knelt there only a few moments before\r\nher father came to hurry her away, and her supplications that he would\r\nsome day take her to mass there were whistled down the wind; and indeed\r\nthe hermit was a layman, and the church was only served on great\r\nfestivals by a monk from the convent of St. Ruprecht, on the distant side\r\nof the mountain, which was further supposed to be in the Schlangenwald\r\ninterest.  Her best chance lay in infusing the desire into Ermentrude,\r\nwho by watching her prayers and asking a few questions had begun to\r\nacquire a few clearer ideas.  And what Ermentrude wished had always\r\nhitherto been acquiesced in by the two lords.\r\n\r\nThe elder baron came little into Christina\xe2\x80\x99s way.  He meant to be kind to\r\nher, but she was dreadfully afraid of him, and, when he came to visit his\r\ndaughter, shrank out of his notice as much as possible, shuddering most\r\nof all at his attempts at civilities.  His son she viewed as one of the\r\nthickwitted giants meant to be food for the heroism of good knights of\r\nromance.  Except that he was fairly conversant with the use of weapons,\r\nand had occasionally ridden beyond the shadow of his own mountain, his\r\nrange was quite as limited as his sister\xe2\x80\x99s; and he had an equal scorn for\r\nall beyond it.  His unfailing kindness to his sister was however in his\r\nfavour, and he always eagerly followed up any suggestion Christina made\r\nfor her pleasure.\r\n\r\nMuch of his time was spent on the child, whose chief nurse and playmate\r\nhe had been throughout her malady; and when she showed him the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narrangements, or repeated to him, in a wondering, blundering way, with\r\nconstant appeals to her attendant, the new tales she had heard, he used\r\nto listen with a pleased awkward amazement at his little Ermentrude\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nastonishing cleverness, joined sometimes with real interest, which was\r\nevinced by his inquiries of Christina.  He certainly did not admire the\r\nlittle, slight, pale bower-maiden, but he seemed to look upon her like\r\nsome strange, almost uncanny, wise spirit out of some other sphere, and\r\nhis manner towards her had none of the offensive freedom apparent in even\r\nthe old man\xe2\x80\x99s patronage.  It was, as Ermentrude once said, laughing,\r\nalmost as if he feared that she might do something to him.\r\n\r\nChristina had expected to see a ruffian, and had found a boor; but she\r\nwas to be convinced that the ruffian existed in him.  Notice came up to\r\nthe castle of a convoy of waggons, and all was excitement.  Men-at-arms\r\nwere mustered, horses led down the Eagle\xe2\x80\x99s Ladder, and an ambush prepared\r\nin the woods.  The autumn rains were already swelling the floods, and the\r\npassage of the ford would be difficult enough to afford the assailants an\r\neasy prey.\r\n\r\nThe Freiherrinn Kunigunde herself, and all the women of the castle,\r\nhurried into Ermentrude\xe2\x80\x99s room to enjoy the view from her window.  The\r\nyoung lady herself was full of eager expectation, but she knew enough of\r\nher maiden to expect no sympathy from her, and loved her well enough not\r\nto bring down on her her mother\xe2\x80\x99s attention; so Christina crept into her\r\nturret, unable to withdraw her eyes from the sight, trembling, weeping,\r\npraying, longing for power to give a warning signal.  Could they be her\r\nown townsmen stopped on the way to dear Ulm?\r\n\r\nShe could see the waggons in mid-stream, the warriors on the bank; she\r\nheard the triumphant outcries of the mother and daughter in the outer\r\nroom.  She saw the overthrow, the struggle, the flight of a few scattered\r\ndark figures on the farther side, the drawing out of the goods on the\r\nnearer.  Oh! were those leaping waves bearing down any good men\xe2\x80\x99s corpses\r\nto the Danube, slain, foully slain by her own father and this gang of\r\nrobbers?\r\n\r\nShe was glad that Ermentrude went down with her mother to watch the\r\nreturn of the victors.  She crouched on the floor, sobbing, shuddering\r\nwith grief and indignation, and telling her beads alike for murdered and\r\nmurderers, till, after the sounds of welcome and exultation, she heard\r\nSir Eberhard\xe2\x80\x99s heavy tread, as he carried his sister up stairs.\r\nErmentrude went up at once to Christina.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all there was little for us!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt was only a wain of\r\nwine barrels; and now will the drunkards down stairs make good cheer.\r\nBut Ebbo could only win for me this gold chain and medal which was round\r\nthe old merchant\xe2\x80\x99s neck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas he slain?\xe2\x80\x9d Christina asked with pale lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only know I did not kill him,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the baron; \xe2\x80\x9cI had him down and\r\ngot the prize, and that was enough for me.  What the rest of the fellows\r\nmay have done, I cannot say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he has brought thee something, Stina,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Ermentrude.  \xe2\x80\x9cShow\r\nit to her, brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father sends you this for your care of my sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eberhard,\r\nholding out a brooch that had doubtless fastened the band of the\r\nunfortunate wine-merchant\xe2\x80\x99s bonnet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, sir; but, indeed, I may not take it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, turning\r\ncrimson, and drawing back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, in amaze; then bethinking himself,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThey are no\r\ntownsfolk of yours, but Constance cowards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it, take it, Stina, or you will anger my father,\xe2\x80\x9d added Ermentrude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, lady, I thank the barons both, but it were sin in me,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nChristina, with trembling voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eberhard; \xe2\x80\x9cwe have the full right\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis a seignorial\r\nright\xe2\x80\x94to all the goods of every wayfarer that may be overthrown in our\r\nriver\xe2\x80\x94as I am a true knight!\xe2\x80\x9d he added earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA true knight!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Christina, pushed hard, and very indignant in\r\nall her terror.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe true knight\xe2\x80\x99s part is to aid, not rob, the weak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd the dark eyes flashed a vivid light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristina!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ermentrude in the extremity of her amazement,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cknow you what you have said?\xe2\x80\x94that Eberhard is no true knight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe meanwhile stood silent, utterly taken by surprise, and letting his\r\nlittle sister fight his battles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot help it, Lady Ermentrude,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, with trembling lips,\r\nand eyes filling with tears.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou may drive me from the castle\xe2\x80\x94I only\r\nlong to be away from it; but I cannot stain my soul by saying that spoil\r\nand rapine are the deeds of a true knight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother will beat you,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ermentrude, passionately, ready to fly\r\nto the head of the stairs; but her brother laid his hand upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTush, Trudchen; keep thy tongue still, child!  What does it hurt me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he turned on his heels and went down stairs.  Christina crept into\r\nher turret, weeping bitterly and with many a wild thought.  Would they\r\nvisit her offence on her father?  Would they turn them both out together?\r\nIf so, would not her father hurl her down the rocks rather than return\r\nher to Ulm?  Could she escape?  Climb down the dizzy rocks, it might be,\r\nsuccour the merchant lying half dead on the meadows, protect and be\r\nprotected, be once more among God-fearing Christians?  And as she felt\r\nher helplessness, the selfish thoughts passed into a gush of tears for\r\nthe murdered man, lying suffering there, and for his possible wife and\r\nchildren watching for him.  Presently Ermentrude peeped in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStina, Stina, don\xe2\x80\x99t cry; I will not tell my mother!  Come out, and\r\nfinish my kerchief!  Come out!  No one shall beat you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not what I wept for, lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina.  \xe2\x80\x9cI do not think you\r\nwould bring harm on me.  But oh!  I would I were at home!  I grieve for\r\nthe bloodshed that I must see and may not hinder, and for that poor\r\nmerchant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ermentrude, \xe2\x80\x9cyou need not fear for him!  I saw his own folk\r\nreturn and lift him up.  But what is he to thee or to us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a burgher maid, lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, recovering herself, and\r\naware that it was of little use to bear testimony to such an auditor as\r\npoor little Ermentrude against the deeds of her own father and brother,\r\nwhich had in reality the sort of sanction Sir Eberhard had mentioned,\r\nmuch akin to those coast rights that were the temptation of wreckers.\r\n\r\nStill she could not but tremble at the thought of her speech, and went\r\ndown to supper in greater trepidation than usual, dreading that she\r\nshould be expected to thank the Freiherr for his gift.  But, fortunately,\r\nmanners were too rare at Adlerstein for any such omission to be\r\nremarkable, and the whole establishment was in a state of noisy triumph\r\nand merriment over the excellence of the French wine they had captured,\r\nso that she slipped into her seat unobserved.\r\n\r\nEvery available drinking-horn and cup was full.  Ermentrude was eagerly\r\npresented with draughts by both father and brother, and presently Sir\r\nEberhard exclaimed, turning towards the shrinking Christina with a rough\r\nlaugh, \xe2\x80\x9cMaiden, I trow thou wilt not taste?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristina shook her head, and framed a negative with her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d asked her father, close to whom she sat.  \xe2\x80\x9cIs\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nfast-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.  Many were present who regarded a fast-day much more\r\nthan the lives or goods of their neighbours.  Christina again shook her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said good-natured Sir Eberhard, evidently wishing to avert\r\nany ill consequence from her.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis only her loss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mirth went on rough and loud, and Christina felt this the worst of\r\nall the miserable meals she had partaken of in fear and trembling at this\r\nplace of her captivity.  Ermentrude, too, was soon in such a state of\r\nexcitement, that not only was Christina\xe2\x80\x99s womanhood bitterly ashamed and\r\ngrieved for her, but there was serious danger that she might at any\r\nmoment break out with some allusion to her maiden\xe2\x80\x99s recusancy in her\r\nreply to Sir Eberhard.\r\n\r\nPresently however Ermentrude laid down her head and began to cry\xe2\x80\x94violent\r\nheadache had come on\xe2\x80\x94and her brother took her in his arms to carry her up\r\nthe stairs; but his potations had begun before hers, and his step was far\r\nfrom steady; he stumbled more than once on the steps, shook and\r\nfrightened his sister, and set her down weeping petulantly.  And then\r\ncame a more terrible moment; his awe of Christina had passed away; he\r\nswore that she was a lovely maiden, with only too free a tongue, and that\r\na kiss must be the seal of her pardon.\r\n\r\nA house full of intoxicated men, no living creature who would care to\r\nprotect her, scarce even her father!  But extremity of terror gave her\r\nstrength.  She spoke resolutely\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSir Eberhard, your sister is ill\xe2\x80\x94you are\r\nin no state to be here.  Go down at once, nor insult a free maiden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nProbably the low-toned softness of the voice, so utterly different from\r\nthe shrill wrangling notes of all the other women he had known, took him\r\nby surprise.  He was still sober enough to be subdued, almost cowed, by\r\nresistance of a description unlike all he had ever seen; his alarm at\r\nChristina\xe2\x80\x99s superior power returned in full force, he staggered to the\r\nstairs, Christina rushed after him, closed the heavy door with all her\r\nforce, fastened it inside, and would have sunk down to weep but for\r\nErmentrude\xe2\x80\x99s peevish wail of distress.\r\n\r\nHappily Ermentrude was still a child, and, neglected as she had been, she\r\nstill had had no one to make her precocious in matters of this kind.  She\r\nwas quite willing to take Christina\xe2\x80\x99s view of the case, and not resent\r\nthe exclusion of her brother; indeed, she was unwell enough to dread the\r\nloudness of his voice and rudeness of his revelry.\r\n\r\nSo the door remained shut, and Christina\xe2\x80\x99s resolve was taken that she\r\nwould so keep it while the wine lasted.  And, indeed, Ermentrude had so\r\nmuch fever all that night and the next day that no going down could be\r\nthought of.  Nobody came near the maidens but Ursel, and she described\r\none continued orgie that made Christina shudder again with fear and\r\ndisgust.  Those below revelled without interval, except for sleep; and\r\nthey took their sleep just where they happened to sink down, then\r\nreturned again to the liquor.  The old baroness repaired to the kitchen\r\nwhen the revelry went beyond even her bearing; but all the time the wine\r\nheld out, the swine in the court were, as Ursel averred, better company\r\nthan the men in the hall.  Yet there might have been worse even than\r\nthis; for old Ursel whispered that at the bottom of the stairs there was\r\na trap-door.  Did the maiden know what it covered?  It was an oubliette.\r\nThere was once a Strasburg armourer who had refused ransom, and talked of\r\nappealing to the Kaiser.  He trod on that door and\xe2\x80\x94Ursel pointed\r\ndownwards.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut since that time,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cmy young lord has never\r\nbrought home a prisoner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo wonder that all this time Christina cowered at the discordant sounds\r\nbelow, trembled, and prayed while she waited on her poor young charge,\r\nwho tossed and moaned in fever and suffering.  She was still far from\r\nrecovered when the materials of the debauch failed, and the household\r\nbegan to return to its usual state.  She was soon restlessly pining for\r\nher brother; and when her father came up to see her, received him with\r\nscant welcome, and entreaties for Ebbo.  She knew she should be better if\r\nshe might only sit on his knee, and lay her head on his shoulder.  The\r\nold Freiherr offered to accommodate her; but she rejected him petulantly,\r\nand still called for Ebbo, till he went down, promising that her brother\r\nshould come.\r\n\r\nWith a fluttering heart Christina awaited the noble whom she had perhaps\r\ninsulted, and whose advances had more certainly insulted her.  Would he\r\nvisit her with his anger, or return to that more offensive familiarity?\r\nShe longed to flee out of sight, when, after a long interval, his heavy\r\ntread was heard; but she could not even take refuge in her turret, for\r\nErmentrude was leaning against her.  Somehow, the step was less assured\r\nthan usual; he absolutely knocked at the door; and, when he came in, he\r\nacknowledged her by a slight inclination of the head.  If she only had\r\nknown it, this was the first time that head had ever been bent to any\r\nbeing, human or Divine; but all she did perceive was that Sir Eberhard\r\nwas in neither of the moods she dreaded, only desperately shy and\r\nsheepish, and extremely ashamed, not indeed of his excess, which would\r\nhave been, even to a much tamer German baron, only a happy accident, but\r\nof what had passed between himself and her.\r\n\r\nHe was much grieved to perceive how much ground Ermentrude had lost, and\r\ngave himself up to fondling and comforting her; and in a few days more,\r\nin their common cares for the sister, Christina lost her newly-acquired\r\nhorror of the brother, and could not but be grateful for his forbearance;\r\nwhile she was almost entertained by the increased awe of herself shown by\r\nthis huge robber baron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nSNOW-WREATHS WHEN \xe2\x80\x99TIS THAW\r\n\r\n\r\nERMENTRUDE had by no means recovered the ground she had lost, before the\r\nwinter set in; and blinding snow came drifting down day and night,\r\nrendering the whole view, above and below, one expanse of white, only\r\nbroken by the peaks of rock which were too steep to sustain the snow.\r\nThe waterfall lengthened its icicles daily, and the whole court was\r\nheaped with snow, up even to the top of the high steps to the hall; and\r\nthus, Christina was told, would it continue all the winter.  What had\r\npreviously seemed to her a strangely door-like window above the porch now\r\nbecame the only mode of egress, when the barons went out bear or\r\nwolf-hunting, or the younger took his crossbow and hound to provide the\r\nwild-fowl, which, under Christina\xe2\x80\x99s skilful hands, would tempt the feeble\r\nappetite of Ermentrude when she was utterly unable to touch the salted\r\nmeats and sausages of the household.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all endeavours to guard the windows and keep up the fire, the\r\ncold withered the poor child like a fading leaf, and she needed more and\r\nmore of tenderness and amusement to distract her attention from her\r\nailments.  Christina\xe2\x80\x99s resources were unfailing.  Out of the softer pine\r\nand birch woods provided for the fire, she carved a set of draughtsmen,\r\nand made a board by ruling squares on the end of a settle, and painting\r\nthe alternate ones with a compound of oil and charcoal.  Even the old\r\nBaron was delighted with this contrivance, and the pleasure it gave his\r\ndaughter.  He remembered playing at draughts in that portion of his youth\r\nwhich had been a shade more polished, and he felt as if the game were\r\nmaking Ermentrude more hike a lady.  Christina was encouraged to proceed\r\nwith a set of chessmen, and the shaping of their characteristic heads\r\nunder her dexterous fingers was watched by Ermentrude like something\r\nmagical.  Indeed, the young lady entertained the belief that there was no\r\nlimit to her attendant\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge or capacity.\r\n\r\nTruly there was a greater brightness and clearness beginning to dawn even\r\nupon poor little Ermentrude\xe2\x80\x99s own dull mind.  She took more interest in\r\neverything: songs were not solely lullabies, but she cared to talk them\r\nover; tales to which she would once have been incapable of paying\r\nattention were eagerly sought after; and, above all, the spiritual\r\nvacancy that her mind had hitherto presented was beginning to be filled\r\nup.  Christina had brought her own books\xe2\x80\x94a library of extraordinary\r\nextent for a maiden of the fifteenth century, but which she owed to her\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s connexion with the arts of wood-cutting and printing.  A Vulgate\r\nfrom Dr. Faustus\xe2\x80\x99s own press, a mass book and breviary, Thomas \xc3\xa0 Kempis\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_Imitation_ and the _Nuremburg Chronicle_ all in Latin, and the poetry of\r\nthe gentle Minnesinger and bird lover, Walther von Vogelweide, in the\r\nvernacular: these were her stock, which Hausfrau Johanna had viewed as a\r\nfoolish encumbrance, and Hugh Sorel would never have transported to the\r\ncastle unless they had been so well concealed in Christina\xe2\x80\x99s kirtles that\r\nhe had taken them for parts of her wardrobe.\r\n\r\nMost precious were they now, when, out of the reach of all teaching save\r\nher own, she had to infuse into the sinking girl\xe2\x80\x99s mind the great\r\nmysteries of life and death, that so she might not leave the world\r\nwithout more hope or faith than her heathen forefathers.  For that\r\nErmentrude would live Christina had never hoped, since that fleeting\r\nimprovement had been cut short by the fever of the wine-cup; the look,\r\nvoice, and tone had become so completely the same as those of Regina\r\nGrundt\xe2\x80\x99s little sister who had pined and died.  She knew she could not\r\ncure, but she could, she felt she could, comfort, cheer, and soften, and\r\nshe no longer repined at her enforced sojourn at Adlerstein.  She\r\nheartily loved her charge, and could not bear to think how desolate\r\nErmentrude would be without her.  And now the poor girl had become\r\nresponsive to her care.  She was infinitely softened in manner, and\r\ntreated her parents with forms of respect new to them; she had learnt\r\neven to thank old Ursel, dropped her imperious tone, and struggled with\r\nher petulance; and, towards her brother, the domineering, uncouth\r\nadherence was becoming real, tender affection; while the dependent,\r\nreverent love she bestowed upon Christina was touching and endearing in\r\nthe extreme.\r\n\r\nFreiherr von Adlerstein saw the change, and congratulated himself on the\r\neffect of having a town-bred bower woman; nay, spoke of the advantage it\r\nwould be to his daughter, if he could persuade himself to make the\r\nsubmission to the Kaiser which the late improvements decided on at the\r\nDiet were rendering more and more inevitable.  _Now_ how happy would be\r\nthe winner of his gentle Ermentrude!\r\n\r\nFreiherrinn von Adlerstein thought the alteration the mere change from\r\nchild to woman, and felt insulted by the supposition that any one might\r\nnot have been proud to match with a daughter of Adlerstein, be she what\r\nshe might.  As to submission to the Kaiser, that was mere folly and\r\nweakness\xe2\x80\x94kaisers, kings, dukes, and counts had broken their teeth against\r\nthe rock of Adlerstein before now!  What had come over her husband and\r\nher son to make them cravens?\r\n\r\nFor Freiherr Eberhard was more strongly convinced than was his father of\r\nthe untenableness of their present position.  Hugh Sorel\xe2\x80\x99s reports of\r\nwhat he heard at Ulm had shown that the league that had been discussed at\r\nRegensburg was far more formidable than anything that had ever previously\r\nthreatened Schloss Adlerstein, and that if the Graf von Schlangenwald\r\njoined in the coalition, there would be private malice to direct its\r\nefforts against the Adlerstein family.  Feud-letters or challenges had\r\nbeen made unlawful for ten years, and was not Adlerstein at feud with the\r\nworld?\r\n\r\nNor did Eberhard look on the submission with the sullen rage and grief\r\nthat his father felt in bringing himself to such a declension from the\r\npride of his ancestors.  What the young Baron heard up stairs was\r\nawakening in him a sense of the poorness and narrowness of his present\r\nlife.  Ermentrude never spared him what interested her; and, partly from\r\nher lips, partly through her appeals to her attendant, he had learnt that\r\nlife had better things to offer than independence on these bare rocks,\r\nand that homage might open the way to higher and worthier exploits than\r\npreying upon overturned waggons.\r\n\r\nDietrich of Berne and his two ancestors, whose lengthy legend Christina\r\ncould sing in a low, soft recitative, were revelations to him of what she\r\nmeant by a true knight\xe2\x80\x94the lion in war, the lamb in peace; the quaint\r\noft-repeated portraits, and still quainter cities, of the Chronicle, with\r\nher explanations and translations, opened his mind to aspirations for\r\nintercourse with his fellows, for an honourable name, and for esteem in\r\nits degree such as was paid to Sir Parzival, to Karl the Great, or to\r\nRodolf of Hapsburgh, once a mountain lord like himself.  Nay, as\r\nErmentrude said, stroking his cheek, and smoothing the flaxen beard, that\r\nsomehow had become much less rough and tangled than it used to be, \xe2\x80\x9cSome\r\nday wilt thou be another Good Freiherr Eberhard, whom all the\r\ncountry-side loved, and who gave bread at the castle-gate to all that\r\nhungered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer brother believed nothing of her slow declension in strength,\r\nascribing all the change he saw to the bitter cold, and seeing but little\r\neven of that alteration, though he spent many hours in her room, holding\r\nher in his arms, amusing her, or talking to her and to Christina.  All\r\nChristina\xe2\x80\x99s fear of him was gone.  As long as there was no liquor in the\r\nhouse, and he was his true self, she felt him to be a kind friend, bound\r\nto her by strong sympathy in the love and care for his sister.  She could\r\ntalk almost as freely before him as when alone with her young lady; and\r\nas Ermentrude\xe2\x80\x99s religious feelings grew stronger, and were freely\r\nexpressed to him, surely his attention was not merely kindness and\r\npatience with the sufferer.\r\n\r\nThe girl\xe2\x80\x99s soul ripened rapidly under the new influences during her\r\nbodily decay; and, as the days lengthened, and the stern hold of winter\r\nrelaxed upon the mountains, Christina looked with strange admiration upon\r\nthe expression that had dawned upon the features once so vacant and dull,\r\nand listened with the more depth of reverence to the sweet words of\r\nfaith, hope and love, because she felt that a higher, deeper teaching\r\nthan she could give must have come to mould the spirit for the new world\r\nto which it was hastening.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cLike an army defeated,\r\n    The snow had retreated,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nout of the valley, whose rich green shone smiling round the pool into\r\nwhich the Debateable Ford spread.  The waterfall had burst its icy bonds,\r\nand dashed down with redoubled voice, roaring rather than babbling.  Blue\r\nand pink hepaticas\xe2\x80\x94or, as Christina called them, liver-krauts\xe2\x80\x94had pushed\r\nup their starry heads, and had even been gathered by Sir Eberhard, and\r\nlaid on his sister\xe2\x80\x99s pillow.  The dark peaks of rock came out all\r\nglistening with moisture, and the snow only retained possession of the\r\ndeep hollows and crevices, into which however its retreat was far more\r\ngraceful than when, in the city, it was trodden by horse and man, and\r\nsoiled with smoke.\r\n\r\nChristina dreaded indeed that the roads should be open, but she could not\r\nlove the snow; it spoke to her of dreariness, savagery, and captivity,\r\nand she watched the dwindling stripes with satisfaction, and hailed the\r\nfall of the petty avalanches from one Eagle\xe2\x80\x99s Step to another as her\r\nforefathers might have rejoiced in the defeat of the Frost giants.\r\n\r\nBut Ermentrude had a love for the white sheet that lay covering a gorge\r\nrunning up from the ravine.  She watched its diminution day by day with a\r\nfancy that she was melting away with it; and indeed it was on the very\r\nday that a succession of drifting showers had left the sheet alone, and\r\nseparated it from the masses of white above, that it first fully dawned\r\nupon the rest of the family that, for the little daughter of the house,\r\nspring was only bringing languor and sinking instead of recovery.\r\n\r\nThen it was that Sir Eberhard first really listened to her entreaty that\r\nshe might not die without a priest, and comforted her by passing his word\r\nto her that, if\xe2\x80\x94he would not say when\xe2\x80\x94the time drew near, he would bring\r\nher one of the priests who had only come from St. Ruprecht\xe2\x80\x99s cloister on\r\ngreat days, by a sort of sufferance, to say mass at the Blessed\r\nFriedmund\xe2\x80\x99s hermitage chapel.\r\n\r\nThe time was slow in coming.  Easter had passed with Ermentrude far too\r\nill for Christina to make the effort she had intended of going to the\r\nchurch, even if she could get no escort but old Ursel\xe2\x80\x94the sheet of snow\r\nhad dwindled to a mere wreath\xe2\x80\x94the ford looked blue in the sunshine\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ncascade tinkled merrily down its rock\xe2\x80\x94mountain primroses peeped out,\r\nwhen, as Father Norbert came forth from saying his ill-attended\r\nPentecostal mass, and was parting with the infirm peasant hermit, a tall\r\nfigure strode up the pass, and, as the villagers fell back to make way,\r\nstood before the startled priest, and said, in a voice choked with grief,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho needs me?\xe2\x80\x9d began the astonished monk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFollow him not, father!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the hermit.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the young\r\nFreiherr.\xe2\x80\x94Oh have mercy on him, gracious sir; he has done your noble\r\nlordships no wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean him no ill,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Eberhard, clearing his voice with\r\ndifficulty; \xe2\x80\x9cI would but have him do his office.  Art thou afraid,\r\npriest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho needs my office?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Father Norbert.  \xe2\x80\x9cShow me fit cause, and\r\nwhat should I dread?  Wherefore dost thou seek me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my sister,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Eberhard, his voice thickening again.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nlittle sister lies at the point of death, and I have sworn to her that a\r\npriest she shall have.  Wilt thou come, or shall I drag thee down the\r\npass?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come, I come with all my heart, sir knight,\xe2\x80\x9d was the ready response.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA few moments and I am at your bidding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stepped back into the hermit\xe2\x80\x99s cave, whence a stair led up to the\r\nchapel.  The anchorite followed him, whispering\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cGood father, escape!\r\nThere will be full time ere he misses you.  The north door leads to the\r\nGemsbock\xe2\x80\x99s Pass; it is open now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I baulk him?  Why should I deny my office to the dying?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nNorbert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas! holy father, thou art new to this country, and know\xe2\x80\x99st not these\r\nmen of blood!  It is a snare to make the convent ransom thee, if not\r\nworse.  The Freiherrinn is a fiend for malice, and the Freiherr is\r\nexcommunicate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it, my son,\xe2\x80\x9d said Norbert; \xe2\x80\x9cbut wherefore should their child\r\nperish unassoilzied?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArt coming, priest?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Eberhard, from his stand at the mouth of\r\nthe cave.\r\n\r\nAnd, as Norbert at once appeared with the pyx and other appliances that\r\nhe had gone to fetch, the Freiherr held out his hand with an offer to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccarry his gear for him;\xe2\x80\x9d and, when the monk refused, with an inward\r\nshudder at entrusting a sacred charge to such unhallowed hands, replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will have work enow for both hands ere the castle is reached.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Father Norbert was by birth a sturdy Switzer, and thought little of\r\nthese Swabian Alps; and he climbed after his guide through the most\r\nrugged passages of Eberhard\xe2\x80\x99s shortest and most perpendicular cut without\r\na moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation, and with agility worthy of a chamois.  The young\r\nbaron turned for a moment, when the level of the castle had been gained,\r\nperhaps to see whether he were following, but at the same time came to a\r\nsudden, speechless pause.\r\n\r\nOn the white masses of vapour that floated on the opposite side of the\r\nmountain was traced a gigantic shadowy outline of a hermit, with head\r\nbent eagerly forward, and arm outstretched.\r\n\r\nThe monk crossed himself.  Eberhard stood still for a moment, and then\r\nsaid, hoarsely,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe Blessed Friedmund!  He is come for her;\xe2\x80\x9d then strode\r\non towards the postern gate, followed by Brother Norbert, a good deal\r\nreassured both as to the genuineness of the young Baron\xe2\x80\x99s message and the\r\nprobable condition of the object of his journey, since the patron saint\r\nof her race was evidently on the watch to speed her departing spirit.\r\n\r\nSir Eberhard led the way up the turret stairs to the open door, and the\r\nmonk entered the death-chamber.  The elder Baron sat near the fire in the\r\nlarge wooden chair, half turned towards his daughter, as one who must\r\nneeds be present, but with his face buried in his hands, unable to endure\r\nthe spectacle.  Nearer was the tall form of his wife, standing near the\r\nfoot of the bed, her stern, harsh features somewhat softened by the\r\nfeelings of the moment.  Ursel waited at hand, with tears running down\r\nher furrowed cheeks.\r\n\r\nFor such as these Father Norbert was prepared; but he little expected to\r\nmeet so pure and sweet a gaze of reverential welcome as beamed on him\r\nfrom the soft, dark eyes of the little white-checked maiden who sat on\r\nthe bed, holding the sufferer in her arms.  Still less had he anticipated\r\nthe serene blessedness that sat on the wasted features of the dying girl,\r\nand all the anguish of labouring breath.\r\n\r\nShe smiled a smile of joy, held up her hand, and thanked her brother.\r\nHer father scarcely lifted his head, her mother made a rigid curtsey, and\r\nwith a grim look of sorrow coming over her features, laid her hand over\r\nthe old Baron\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.  \xe2\x80\x9cCome away, Herr Vater,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9che is\r\ngoing to hear her confession, and make her too holy for the like of us to\r\ntouch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man rose up, and stepped towards his child.  Ermentrude held out\r\nher arms to him, and murmured\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, father, pardon me; I would have been a better daughter if I had\r\nonly known\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d  He gathered her in his arms; he was quite past speaking;\r\nand they only heard his heavy breathing, and one more whisper from\r\nErmentrude\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAnd oh! father, one day wilt thou seek to be absolved?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nWhether he answered or not they knew not; he only gave her repeated\r\nkisses, and laid her down on her pillows, then rushed to the door, and\r\nthe passionate sobs of the strong man\xe2\x80\x99s uncontrolled nature might be\r\nheard upon the stair.  The parting with the others was not necessarily so\r\ncomplete, as they were not, like him, under censure of the Church; but\r\nKunigunde leant down to kiss her; and, in return to her repetition of her\r\nentreaty for pardon, replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThou hast it, child, if it will ease thy\r\nmind; but it is all along of these new fancies that ever an Adlerstein\r\nthought of pardon.  There, there, I blame thee not, poor maid; it thou\r\nwert to die, it may be even best as it is.  Now must I to thy father; he\r\nis troubled enough about this gear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut when Eberhard moved towards his sister, she turned to the priest, and\r\nsaid, imploringly, \xe2\x80\x9cNot far, not far!  Oh! let them,\xe2\x80\x9d pointing to\r\nEberhard and Christina, \xe2\x80\x9clet them not be quite out of sight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of hearing is all that is needed, daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the priest; and\r\nErmentrude looked content as Christina moved towards the empty north\r\nturret, where, with the door open, she was in full view, and Eberhard\r\nfollowed her thither.  It was indeed fully out of earshot of the child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfaint, gasping confession.  Gravely and sadly both stood there.\r\nChristina looked up the hillside for the snow-wreath.  The May sunshine\r\nhad dissolved it; the green pass lay sparkling without a vestige of its\r\nwhite coating.  Her eyes full of tears, she pointed the spot out to\r\nEberhard.  He understood; but, leaning towards her, told, under his\r\nbreath, of the phantom he had seen.  Her eyes expanded with awe of the\r\nsupernatural.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the Blessed Friedmund,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eberhard.  \xe2\x80\x9cNever\r\nhath he so greeted one of our race since the pious Freiherrinn\r\nHildegarde.  Maiden, hast thou brought us back a blessing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! well may she be blessed\xe2\x80\x94well may the saints stoop to greet her,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nmurmured Christina, with strangled voice, scarcely able to control her\r\nsobs.\r\n\r\nFather Norbert came towards them.  The simple confession had been heard,\r\nand he sought the aid of Christina in performing the last rites of the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaiden,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cthou hast done a great and blessed work, such\r\nas many a priest might envy thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEberhard was not excluded during the final services by which the soul was\r\nto be dismissed from its earthly dwelling-place.  True, he comprehended\r\nlittle of their import, and nothing of the words, but he gazed meekly,\r\nwith uncovered head, and a bewildered look of sadness, while Christina\r\nmade her responses and took her part with full intelligence and deep\r\nfervour, sorrowing indeed for the companion who had become so dear to\r\nher, but deeply thankful for the spiritual consolation that had come at\r\nlast.  Ermentrude lay calm, and, as it were, already rapt into a higher\r\nworld, lighting up at the German portions of the service, and not wholly\r\ndevoid of comprehension of the spirit even of the Latin, as indeed she\r\nhad come to the border of the region where human tongues and languages\r\nare no more.\r\n\r\nShe was all but gone when the rite of extreme unction was completed, and\r\nthey could only stand round her, Eberhard, Christina, Ursel, and the old\r\nBaroness, who had returned again, watching the last flutterings of the\r\nbreath, the window thrown wide open that nothing might impede the passage\r\nof the soul to the blue vault above.\r\n\r\nThe priest spoke the beautiful commendation, \xe2\x80\x9cDepart, O Christian soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThere was a faint gesture in the midst for Christina to lift her in her\r\narms\xe2\x80\x94a sign to bend down and kiss her brow\xe2\x80\x94but her last look was for her\r\nbrother, her last murmur, \xe2\x80\x9cCome after me; be the Good Baron Ebbo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nTHE YOUNG FREIHERR\r\n\r\n\r\nERMENTRUDE VON ADLERSTEIN slept with her forefathers in the vaults of the\r\nhermitage chapel, and Christina Sorel\xe2\x80\x99s work was done.\r\n\r\nSurely it was time for her to return home, though she should be more\r\nsorry to leave the mountain castle than she could ever have believed\r\npossible.  She entreated her father to take her home, but she received a\r\nsharp answer that she did not know what she was talking of: the\r\nSchlangenwald Reitern were besetting all the roads; and moreover the Ulm\r\nburghers had taken the capture of the Constance wine in such dudgeon that\r\nfor a retainer of Adlerstein to show himself in the streets would be an\r\nabsolute asking for the wheel.\r\n\r\nBut was there any hope for her?  Could he not take her to some nunnery\r\nmidway, and let her write to her uncle to fetch her from thence?\r\n\r\nHe swore at woman\xe2\x80\x99s pertinacity, but allowed at last that if the plan,\r\ntalked of by the Barons, of going to make their submission to the Emperor\r\nat Linz, with a view to which all violence at the ford had ceased, should\r\nhold good, it might be possible thus to drop her on their way.\r\n\r\nWith this Christina must needs content herself.  Poor child, not only had\r\nErmentrude\xe2\x80\x99s death deprived her of the sole object of her residence at\r\nSchloss Adlerstein, but it had infinitely increased the difficulties of\r\nher position.  No one interfered with her possession of the upper room\r\nand its turrets; and it was only at meal times that she was obliged to\r\nmingle with the other inhabitants, who, for the most part, absolutely\r\noverlooked the little shrinking pale maiden but with one exception, and\r\nthat the most perplexing of all.  She had been on terms with Freiherr\r\nEberhard that were not so easily broken off as if she had been an old\r\nwoman of Ursel\xe2\x80\x99s age.  All through his sister\xe2\x80\x99s decline she had been his\r\ncomforter, assistant, director, living in intercourse and sympathy that\r\nought surely to cease when she was no longer his sister\xe2\x80\x99s attendant, yet\r\nwhich must be more than ever missed in the full freshness of the stroke.\r\n\r\nEven on the earliest day of bereavement, a sudden thought of Hausfrau\r\nJohanna flashed upon Christina, and reminded her of the guard she must\r\nkeep over herself if she would return to Ulm the same modest girl whom\r\nher aunt could acquit of all indiscretion.  Her cheeks flamed, as she sat\r\nalone, with the very thought, and the next time she heard the well-known\r\ntread on the stair, she fled hastily into her own turret chamber, and\r\nshut the door.  Her heart beat fast.  She could hear Sir Eberhard moving\r\nabout the room, and listened to his heavy sigh as he threw himself into\r\nthe large chair.  Presently he called her by name, and she felt it\r\nneedful to open her door and answer, respectfully,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you, my lord?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would I?  A little peace, and heed to her who is gone.  To see my\r\nfather and mother one would think that a partridge had but flown away.  I\r\nhave seen my father more sorrowful when his dog had fallen over the\r\nabyss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMayhap there is more sorrow for a brute that cannot live again,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nChristina.  \xe2\x80\x9cOur bird has her nest by an Altar that is lovelier and\r\nbrighter than even our Dome Kirk will ever be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, Christina,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, dragging a chair nearer the hearth.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nheart is sore, and I cannot bear the din below.  Tell me where my bird is\r\nflown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! sir; pardon me.  I must to the kitchen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, crossing\r\nher hands over her breast, to still her trembling heart, for she was very\r\nsorry for his grief, but moving resolutely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust?  And wherefore?  Thou hast nought to do there; speak truth!  Why\r\nnot stay with me?\xe2\x80\x9d and his great light eyes opened wide.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA burgher maid may not sit down with a noble baron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!  Has my mother been plaguing thee, child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, \xe2\x80\x9cshe reeks not of me; but\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94steadying her\r\nvoice with great difficulty\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit behoves me the more to be discreet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you would not have me come here!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a wistful tone of\r\nreproach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no power to forbid you; but if you do, I must betake me to Ursel\r\nin the kitchen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, very low, trembling and half choked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmong the rude wenches there!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, starting up.  \xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay, that\r\nshall not be!  Rather will I go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this is very cruel of thee, maiden,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, lingering, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I\r\ngive thee my knightly word that all should be as when she whom we both\r\nloved was here,\xe2\x80\x9d and his voice shook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt could not so be, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Christina with drooping, blushing\r\nface; \xe2\x80\x9cit would not be maidenly in me.  Oh, my lord, you are kind and\r\ngenerous, make it not hard for me to do what other maidens less lonely\r\nhave friends to do for them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKind and generous?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eberhard, leaning over the back of the chair as\r\nif trying to begin a fresh score.  \xe2\x80\x9cThis from you, who told me once I was\r\nno true knight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall call you a true knight with all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Christina, the\r\ntears rushing into her eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cif you will respect my weakness and\r\nloneliness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood up again, as if to move away; then paused, and, twisting his\r\ngold chain, said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how am I ever to be what the happy one bade me, if\r\nyou will not show me how?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy error would never show you the right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, with a strong\r\neffort at firmness, and retreating at once through the door of the\r\nstaircase, whence she made her way to the kitchen, and with great\r\ndifficulty found an excuse for her presence there.\r\n\r\nIt had been a hard struggle with her compassion and gratitude, and, poor\r\nlittle Christina felt with dismay, with something more than these.  Else\r\nwhy was it that, even while principle and better sense summoned her back\r\nto Ulm, she experienced a deadly weariness of the city-pent air, of the\r\ngrave, heavy roll of the river, nay, even of the quiet, well-regulated\r\nhousehold?  Why did such a marriage as she had thought her natural\r\ndestiny, with some worthy, kind-hearted brother of the guild, become so\r\nhateful to her that she could only aspire to a convent life?  This same\r\nburgomaster would be an estimable man, no doubt, and those around her\r\nwere ruffians, but she felt utterly contemptuous and impatient of him.\r\nAnd why was the interchange of greetings, the few words at meals, worth\r\nall the rest of the day besides to her?  Her own heart was the traitor,\r\nand to her own sensations the poor little thing had, in spirit at least,\r\ntransgressed all Aunt Johanna\xe2\x80\x99s precepts against young Barons.  She wept\r\napart, and resolved, and prayed, cruelly ashamed of every start of joy or\r\npain that the sight of Eberhard cost her.  From almost the first he had\r\nsat next her at the single table that accommodated the whole household at\r\nmeals, and the custom continued, though on some days he treated her with\r\nsullen silence, which she blamed herself for not rejoicing in, sometimes\r\nhe spoke a few friendly words; but he observed, better than she could\r\nhave dared to expect, her test of his true knighthood, and never again\r\nforced himself into her apartment, though now and then he came to the\r\ndoor with flowers, with mountain strawberries, and once with two young\r\ndoves.  \xe2\x80\x9cTake them, Christina,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are very like yourself;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand he always delayed so long that she was forced to be resolute, and\r\nshut the door on him at last.\r\n\r\nOnce, when there was to be a mass at the chapel, Hugh Sorel, between a\r\nsmile and a growl, informed his daughter that he would take her thereto.\r\nShe gladly prepared, and, bent on making herself agreeable to her father,\r\ndid not once press on him the necessity of her return to Ulm.  To her\r\namazement and pleasure, the young Baron was at church, and when on the\r\nway home, he walked beside her mule, she could see no need of sending him\r\naway.\r\n\r\nHe had been in no school of the conventionalities of life, and, when he\r\nsaw that Hugh Sorel\xe2\x80\x99s presence had obtained him this favour, he wistfully\r\nasked, \xe2\x80\x9cChristina, if I bring your father with me, will you not let me\r\nin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEntreat me not, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, with fluttering breath.\r\n\r\nShe felt the more that she was right in this decision, when she\r\nencountered her father\xe2\x80\x99s broad grin of surprise and diversion, at seeing\r\nthe young Baron help her to dismount.  It was a look of receiving an idea\r\nboth new, comical, and flattering, but by no means the look of a father\r\nwho would resent the indignity of attentions to his daughter from a man\r\nwhose rank formed an insuperable barrier to marriage.\r\n\r\nThe effect was a new, urgent, and most piteous entreaty, that he would\r\nfind means of sending her home.  It brought upon her the hearing put into\r\nwords what her own feelings had long shrunk from confessing to herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!  Why, what now?  What, is the young Baron after thee?  Ha! ha!\r\npetticoats are few enough up here, but he must have been ill off ere he\r\ntook to a little ghost like thee!  I saw he was moping and doleful, but I\r\nthought it was all for his sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so it is, father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me that, when he watches every turn of that dark eye of thine\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nonly good thing thou took\xe2\x80\x99st of mine!  Thou art a witch, Stina.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, oh hush, for pity\xe2\x80\x99s sake, father, and let me go home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, thou likest him not?  Thy mind is all for the mincing goldsmith\r\nopposite, as I ever told thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mind is\xe2\x80\x94is to return to my uncle and aunt the true-hearted maiden\r\nthey parted with,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, with clasped hands.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd oh, father,\r\nas you were the son of a true and faithful mother, be a father to me now!\r\nJeer not your motherless child, but protect her and help her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHugh Sorel was touched by this appeal, and he likewise recollected how\r\nmuch it was for his own interest that his brother should be satisfied\r\nwith the care he took of his daughter.  He became convinced that the\r\nsooner she was out of the castle the better, and at length bethought him\r\nthat, among the merchants who frequented the Midsummer Fair at the\r\nBlessed Friedmund\xe2\x80\x99s Wake, a safe escort might be found to convey her back\r\nto Ulm.\r\n\r\nIf the truth were known, Hugh Sorel was not devoid of a certain feeling\r\nakin to contempt, both for his young master\xe2\x80\x99s taste, and for his\r\nforbearance in not having pushed matters further with a being so\r\nhelpless, meek, and timid as Christina, more especially as such slackness\r\nhad not been his wont in other cases where his fancy had been caught.\r\n\r\nBut Sorel did not understand that it was not physical beauty that here\r\nhad been the attraction, though to some persons, the sweet, pensive eyes,\r\nthe delicate, pure skin, the slight, tender form, might seem to exceed in\r\nloveliness the fully developed animal comeliness chiefly esteemed at\r\nAdlerstein.  It was rather the strangeness of the power and purity of\r\nthis timid, fragile creature, that had struck the young noble.  With all\r\ntheir brutal manners reverence for a lofty female nature had been in the\r\nGerman character ever since their Velleda prophesied to them, and this\r\nreverence in Eberhard bowed at the feet of the pure gentle maiden, so\r\nstrong yet so weak, so wistful and entreating even in her resolution,\r\nrefined as a white flower on a heap of refuse, wise and dexterous beyond\r\nhis slow and dull conception, and the first being in whom he had ever\r\nseen piety or goodness; and likewise with a tender, loving spirit of\r\nconsolation such as he had both beheld and tasted by his sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeathbed.\r\n\r\nThere was almost a fear mingled with his reverence.  If he had been more\r\nfamiliar with the saints, he would thus have regarded the holy virgin\r\nmartyrs, nay, even Our Lady herself; and he durst not push her so hard as\r\nto offend her, and excite the anger or the grief that he alike dreaded.\r\nHe was wretched and forlorn without the resources he had found in his\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s room; the new and better cravings of his higher nature had been\r\nexcited only to remain unsupplied and disappointed; and the affectionate\r\nheart in the freshness of its sorrow yearned for the comfort that such\r\nconversation had supplied: but the impression that had been made on him\r\nwas still such, that he knew that to use rough means of pressing his\r\nwishes would no more lead to his real gratification than it would to\r\nappropriate a snow-bell by crushing it in his gauntlet.\r\n\r\nAnd it was on feeble little Christina, yielding in heart, though not in\r\nwill, that it depended to preserve this reverence, and return unscathed\r\nfrom this castle, more perilous now than ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\nTHE BLESSED FRIEDMUND\xe2\x80\x99S WAKE\r\n\r\n\r\nMIDSUMMER-DAY arrived, and the village of Adlerstein presented a most\r\nunusual spectacle.  The wake was the occasion of a grand fair for all the\r\nmountain-side, and it was an understood thing that the Barons, instead of\r\nmolesting the pedlars, merchants, and others who attended it, contented\r\nthemselves with demanding a toll from every one who passed the Kohler\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhut on the one side, or the Gemsbock\xe2\x80\x99s Pass on the other; and this toll,\r\nbeing the only coin by which they came honestly in the course of the\r\nyear, was regarded as a certainty and highly valued.  Moreover, it was\r\nthe only time that any purchases could be made, and the flotsam of the\r\nford did not always include all even of the few requirements of the\r\ninmates of the castle; it was the only holiday, sacred or secular, that\r\never gladdened the Eagle\xe2\x80\x99s Rock.\r\n\r\nSo all the inmates of the castle prepared to enjoy themselves, except the\r\nheads of the house.  The Freiherr had never been at one of these wakes\r\nsince the first after he was excommunicated, when he had stalked round to\r\nshow his indifference to the sentence; and the Freiherrinn snarled out\r\nsuch sentences of disdain towards the concourse, that it might be\r\nsupposed that she hated the sight of her kind; but Ursel had all the\r\nhousehold purchases to make, and the kitchen underlings were to take\r\nturns to go and come, as indeed were the men-at-arms, who were set to\r\nwatch the toll-bars.\r\n\r\nChristina had packed up a small bundle, for the chance of being unable to\r\nreturn to the castle without missing her escort, though she hoped that\r\nthe fair might last two days, and that she should thus be enabled to\r\nreturn and bring away the rest of her property.  She was more and more\r\nresolved on going, but her heart was less and less inclined to departure.\r\nAnd bitter had been her weeping through all the early light hours of the\r\nlong morning\xe2\x80\x94weeping that she tried to think was all for Ermentrude; and\r\nall, amid prayers she could scarce trust herself to offer, that the\r\ngenerous, kindly nature might yet work free of these evil surroundings,\r\nand fulfil the sister\xe2\x80\x99s dying wish, she should never see it; but, when\r\nshe should hear that the Debateable Ford was the Friendly Ford, then\r\nwould she know that it was the doing of the Good Baron Ebbo.  Could she\r\nventure on telling him so?  Or were it not better that there were no\r\nfarewell?  And she wept again that he should think her ungrateful.  She\r\ncould not persuade herself to release the doves, but committed the charge\r\nto Ursel to let them go in case she should not return.\r\n\r\nSo tear-stained was her face, that, ashamed that it should be seen, she\r\nwrapped it closely in her hood and veil when she came down and joined her\r\nfather.  The whole scene swam in tears before her eyes when she saw the\r\nwhole green slope from the chapel covered with tents and booths, and\r\nswarming with pedlars and mountaineers in their picturesque dresses.\r\nWomen and girls were exchanging the yarn of their winter\xe2\x80\x99s spinning for\r\nbright handkerchiefs; men drove sheep, goats, or pigs to barter for\r\nknives, spades, or weapons; others were gazing at simple shows\xe2\x80\x94a dancing\r\nbear or ape\xe2\x80\x94or clustering round a Minnesinger; many even then\r\ncongregating in booths for the sale of beer.  Further up, on the flat\r\nspace of sward above the chapel, were some lay brothers, arranging for\r\nthe representation of a mystery\xe2\x80\x94a kind of entertainment which Germany\r\nowed to the English who came to the Council of Constance, and which the\r\nmonks of St. Ruprecht\xe2\x80\x99s hoped might infuse some religious notions into\r\nthe wild, ignorant mountaineers.\r\n\r\nFirst however Christina gladly entered the church.  Crowded though it\r\nwere, it was calmer than the busy scene without.  Faded old tapestry was\r\ndecking its walls, representing apparently some subject entirely alien to\r\nSt. John or the blessed hermit; Christina rather thought it was Mars and\r\nVenus, but that was all the same to every one else.  And there was a\r\nterrible figure of St. John, painted life-like, with a real hair-cloth\r\nround his loins, just opposite to her, on the step of the Altar; also\r\npoor Friedmund\xe2\x80\x99s bones, dressed up in a new serge amice and hood; the\r\nstone from Nic\xc3\xa6a was in a gilded box, ready in due time to be kissed; and\r\na preaching friar (not one of the monks of St. Ruprecht\xe2\x80\x99s) was in the\r\nmidst of a sermon, telling how St. John presided at the Council of Nic\xc3\xa6a\r\ntill the Emperor Maximius cut off his head at the instance of\r\nHerodius\xe2\x80\x94full justice being done to the dancing\xe2\x80\x94and that the blood was\r\nsprinkled on this very stone, whereupon our Holy Father the Pope decreed\r\nthat whoever would kiss the said stone, and repeat the Credo five times\r\nafterwards, should be capable of receiving an indulgence for 500 years:\r\nwhich indulgence must however be purchased at the rate of six groschen,\r\nto be bestowed in alms at Rome.  And this inestimable benefit he, poor\r\nFriar Peter, had come from his brotherhood of St. Francis at Offingen\r\nsolely to dispense to the poor mountaineers.\r\n\r\nIt was disappointing to find this profane mummery going on instead of the\r\nholy services to which Christina had looked forward for strength and\r\ncomfort; she was far too well instructed not to be scandalized at the\r\nprofane deception which was ripening fast for Luther, only thirty years\r\nlater; and, when the stone was held up by the friar in one hand, the\r\nprinted briefs of indulgence in the other, she shrunk back.  Her father\r\nhowever said, \xe2\x80\x9cWilt have one, child?  Five hundred years is no bad\r\nbargain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy uncle has small trust in indulgences,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll lies, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Hugh; \xe2\x80\x9cyet they\xe2\x80\x99ve the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s seal, and I\r\nhave more than half a mind to get one.  Five hundred years is no joke,\r\nand I am sure of purgatory, since I bought this medal at the Holy House\r\nof Loretto.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he went forward, and invested six groschen in one of the papers, the\r\nmost religious action poor Christina had ever seen him perform.  Other\r\npurchasers came forward\xe2\x80\x94several, of the castle _knappen_, and a few\r\npeasant women who offered yarn or cheeses as equivalents for money, but\r\nwere told with some insolence to go and sell their goods, and bring the\r\ncoin.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, the friar, finding his traffic slack, thought fit to\r\nremove, with his two lay assistants, outside the chapel, and try the\r\neffects of an out-of-door sermon.  Hugh Sorel, who had been hitherto\r\nrather diverted by the man\xe2\x80\x99s gestures and persuasions, now decided on\r\ngoing out into the fair in quest of an escort for his daughter, but as\r\nshe saw Father Norbert and another monk ascending from the stairs leading\r\nto the hermit\xe2\x80\x99s cell, she begged to be allowed to remain in the church,\r\nwhere she was sure to be safe, instead of wandering about with him in the\r\nfair.\r\n\r\nHe was glad to be unencumbered, though he thought her taste unnatural;\r\nand, promising to return for her when he had found an escort, he left\r\nher.\r\n\r\nFather Norbert had come for the very purpose of hearing confessions, and\r\nChristina\xe2\x80\x99s next hour was the most comfortable she had spent since\r\nErmentrude\xe2\x80\x99s death.\r\n\r\nAfter this however the priests were called away, and long, long did\r\nChristina first kneel and then sit in the little lonely church, hearing\r\nthe various sounds without, and imagining that her father had forgotten\r\nher, and that he and all the rest were drinking, and then what would\r\nbecome of her?  Why had she quitted old Ursel\xe2\x80\x99s protection?\r\n\r\nHours of waiting and nameless alarm must have passed, for the sun was\r\nwaxing low, when at length she heard steps coming up the hermit\xe2\x80\x99s cell,\r\nand a head rose above the pavement which she recognized with a wild throb\r\nof joy, but, repressing her sense of gladness, she only exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nwhere is my father!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have sent him to the toll at the Gemsbock\xe2\x80\x99s Pass,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sir\r\nEberhard, who had by this time come up the stairs, followed by Brother\r\nPeter and the two lay assistants.  Then, as Christina turned on him her\r\nstartled, terrified eyes in dismay and reproach for such thoughtlessness,\r\nhe came towards her, and, bending his head and opening his hand, he\r\nshowed on his palm two gold rings.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere, little one,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cnow\r\nshalt thou never again shut me out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer senses grew dizzy.  \xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d she faintly said, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is no place to\r\ndelude a poor maiden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI delude thee not.  The brother here waits to wed us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible!  A burgher maid is not for such as you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone but a burgher maid will I wed,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sir Eberhard, with all the\r\nsettled resolution of habits of command.  \xe2\x80\x9cSee, Christina, thou art\r\nsweeter and better than any lady in the land; thou canst make me what\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x94the blessed one who lies there\xe2\x80\x94would have me.  I love thee as never\r\nknight loved lady.  I love thee so that I have not spoken a word to\r\noffend thee when my heart was bursting; and\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94as he saw her irrepressible\r\ntears\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI think thou lovest me a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped with a sob, \xe2\x80\x9clet me go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou canst not go home; there is none here fit to take charge of thee.\r\nOr if there were, I would slay him rather than let thee go.  No, not so,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, as he saw how little those words served his cause; \xe2\x80\x9cbut without\r\nthee I were a mad and desperate man.  Christina, I will not answer for\r\nmyself if thou dost not leave this place my wedded wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d implored Christina, \xe2\x80\x9cif you would only betroth me, and woo me like\r\nan honourable maiden from my home at Ulm!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetroth thee, ay, and wed thee at once,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Eberhard, who, all\r\nalong, even while his words were most pleading, had worn a look and\r\nmanner of determined authority and strength, good-natured indeed, but\r\nresolved.  \xe2\x80\x9cI am not going to miss my opportunity, or baulk the friar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe friar, who had meantime been making a few needful arrangements for\r\nthe ceremony, advanced towards them.  He was a good-humoured, easy-going\r\nman, who came prepared to do any office that came in his way on such\r\nfestival days at the villages round; and peasant marriages at such times\r\nwere not uncommon.  But something now staggered him, and he said\r\nanxiously\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis maiden looks convent-bred!  Herr Reiter, pardon me; but if this be\r\nthe breaking of a cloister, I can have none of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo such thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eberhard; \xe2\x80\x9cshe is town-bred, that is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would swear to it, on the holy mass yonder, both of you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nfriar, still suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Eberhard, \xe2\x80\x9cand so dost thou, Christina.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the time if ever to struggle against her destiny.  The friar\r\nwould probably have listened to her if she had made any vehement\r\nopposition to a forced marriage, and if not, a few shrieks would have\r\nbrought perhaps Father Norbert, and certainly the whole population; but\r\nthe horror and shame of being found in such a situation, even more than\r\nthe probability that she might meet with vengeance rather than\r\nprotection, withheld her.  Even the friar could hardly have removed her,\r\nand this was her only chance of safety from the Baroness\xe2\x80\x99s fury.  Had she\r\nhated and loathed Sir Eberhard, perhaps she had striven harder, but his\r\nwhole demeanour constrained and quelled her, and the chief effort she\r\nmade against yielding was the reply, \xe2\x80\x9cI am no cloister maid, holy father,\r\nbut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cbut\xe2\x80\x9d was lost in the friar\xe2\x80\x99s jovial speech.  \xe2\x80\x9cOh, then, all is well!\r\nTake thy place, pretty one, there, by the door, thou know\xe2\x80\x99st it should be\r\nin the porch, but\xe2\x80\x94ach, I understand!\xe2\x80\x9d as Eberhard quietly drew the bolt\r\nwithin.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, little one, I have no time for bride scruples and\r\ncoyness; I have to train three dull-headed louts to be Shem, Ham, and\r\nJaphet before dark.  Hast confessed of late?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, and \xe2\x80\x9cThis morning,\xe2\x80\x9d to her great\r\njoy, said Eberhard, and, in her satisfaction thereat, her second \xe2\x80\x9cbut\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwas not followed up.\r\n\r\nThe friar asked their names, and both gave the Christian name alone; then\r\nthe brief and simple rite was solemnized in its shortest form.  Christina\r\nhad, by very force of surprise and dismay, gone through all without signs\r\nof agitation, except the quivering of her whole frame, and the icy\r\ncoldness of the hand, where Eberhard had to place the ring on each finger\r\nin turn.\r\n\r\nBut each mutual vow was a strange relief to her long-tossed and divided\r\nmind, and it was rest indeed to let her affection have its will, and own\r\nhim indeed as a protector to be loved instead of shunned.  When all was\r\nover, and he gathered the two little cold hands into his large one, his\r\narm supporting her trembling form, she felt for the moment, poor little\r\nthing, as if she could never be frightened again.\r\n\r\nParish registers were not, even had this been a parish church, but\r\nBrother Peter asked, when he had concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, my son, which of his\r\nflock am I to report to your Pfarrer as linked together?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe less your tongue wags on that matter till I call on you, the\r\nbetter,\xe2\x80\x9d was the stern reply.  \xe2\x80\x9cLook you, no ill shall befall you if you\r\nare wise, but remember, against the day I call you to bear witness, that\r\nyou have this day wedded Baron Eberhard von Adlerstein the younger, to\r\nChristina, the daughter of Hugh Sorel, the Esquire of Ulm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hast played me a trick, Sir Baron!\xe2\x80\x9d said the friar, somewhat\r\ndismayed, but more amused, looking up at Eberhard, who, as Christina now\r\nsaw, had divested himself of his gilt spurs, gold chain, silvered belt\r\nand horn, and eagle\xe2\x80\x99s plume, so as to have passed for a simple\r\nlanzknecht.  \xe2\x80\x9cI would have had no such gear as this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I supposed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eberhard coolly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung folks! young folks!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the friar, changing his tone, and\r\nholding up his finger slyly; \xe2\x80\x9cthe little bird so cunningly nestled in the\r\nchurch to fly out my Lady Baroness!  Well, so thou hast a pretty, timid\r\nlambkin there, Sir Baron.  Take care you use her mildly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEberhard looked into Christina\xe2\x80\x99s face with a smile, that to her, at\r\nleast, was answer enough; and he held out half a dozen links of his gold\r\nchain to the friar, and tossed a coin to each of the lay brethren.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for the poor friar himself,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Brother Peter, on receiving\r\nthis marriage fee; \xe2\x80\x9cit all goes to the weal of the brotherhood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eberhard.  \xe2\x80\x9cSilence, that is all!  And thy\r\nfriary\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor house of St. Francis at Offingen for the present, noble sir,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the priest.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere will you hear of me, if you find me not.  And\r\nnow, fare thee well, my gracious lady.  I hope one day thou wilt have\r\nmore words to thank the poor brother who has made thee a noble Baroness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, good father, pardon my fright and confusion,\xe2\x80\x9d Christina tried to\r\nmurmur, but at that moment a sudden glow and glare of light broke out on\r\nthe eastern rock, illuminating the fast darkening little church with a\r\nflickering glare, that made her start in terror as if the fires of heaven\r\nwere threatening this stolen marriage; but the friar and Eberhard both\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Needfire alight already!\xe2\x80\x9d  And she recollected how often\r\nshe had seen these bonfires on Midsummer night shining red on every hill\r\naround Ulm.  Loud shouts were greeting the uprising flame, and the people\r\ngathering thicker and thicker on the slope.  The friar undid the door to\r\nhasten out into the throng, and Eberhard said he had left his spurs and\r\nbelt in the hermit\xe2\x80\x99s cell, and must return thither, after which he would\r\nwalk home with his bride, moving at the same time towards the stair, and\r\nthereby causing a sudden scuffle and fall.  \xe2\x80\x9cSo, master hermit,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth\r\nEberhard, as the old man picked himself up, looking horribly frightened;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s your hermit\xe2\x80\x99s abstraction, is it?  No whining, old man, I am not\r\ngoing to hurt thee, so thou canst hold thy tongue.  Otherwise I will\r\nsmoke thee out of thy hole like a wild cat!  What, thou aiding me with my\r\nbelt, my lovely one?  Thanks; the snap goes too hard for thy little\r\nhands.  Now, then, the fire will light us gaily down the mountain side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it soon appeared that to depart was impossible, unless by forcing a\r\nway through the busy throng in the full red glare of the firelight, and\r\nthey were forced to pause at the opening of the hermit\xe2\x80\x99s cave, Christina\r\nleaning on her husband\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and a fold of his mantle drawn round her to\r\nguard her from the night-breeze of the mountain, as they waited for a\r\nquiet space in which to depart unnoticed.  It was a strange, wild scene!\r\nThe fire was on a bare, flat rock, which probably had been yearly so\r\nemployed ever since the Kelts had brought from the East the rite that\r\nthey had handed on to the Swabians\xe2\x80\x94the Beltane fire, whose like was\r\nblazing everywhere in the Alps, in the Hartz, nay, even in England,\r\nScotland, and on the granite points of Ireland.  Heaped up for many\r\nprevious days with faggots from the forest, then apparently\r\ninexhaustible, the fire roared and crackled, and rose high, red and\r\nsmoky, into the air, paling the moon, and obscuring the stars.  Round it,\r\ncompletely hiding the bonfire itself, were hosts of dark figures swarming\r\nto approach it\xe2\x80\x94all with a purpose.  All held old shoes or superannuated\r\ngarments in their hands to feed the flame; for it was esteemed needful\r\nthat every villager should contribute something from his house\xe2\x80\x94once, no\r\ndoubt, as an offering to Bel, but now as a mere unmeaning observance.\r\nAnd shrieks of merriment followed the contribution of each too well-known\r\narticle of rubbish that had been in reserve for the Needfire!  Girls and\r\nboys had nuts to throw in, in pairs, to judge by their bounces of future\r\nchances of matrimony.  Then came a shouting, tittering, and falling back,\r\nas an old boor came forward like a priest with something heavy and\r\nghastly in his arms, which was thrown on with a tremendous shout,\r\ndarkened the glow for a moment, then hissed, cracked, and emitted a\r\nhorrible odour.\r\n\r\nIt was a horse\xe2\x80\x99s head, the right owner of which had been carefully kept\r\nfor the occasion, though long past work.  Christina shuddered, and felt\r\nas if she had fallen upon a Pagan ceremony; as indeed was true enough,\r\nonly that the Adlersteiners attached no meaning to the performance,\r\nexcept a vague notion of securing good luck.\r\n\r\nWith the same idea the faggots were pulled down, and arranged so as to\r\nform a sort of lane of fire.  Young men rushed along it, and then bounded\r\nover the diminished pile, amid loud shouts of laughter and either\r\nadmiration or derision; and, in the meantime, a variety of odd, recusant\r\nnoises, grunts, squeaks, and lowings proceeding from the darkness were\r\nexplained to the startled little bride by her husband to come from all\r\nthe cattle of the mountain farms around, who were to have their weal\r\nsecured by being driven through the Needfire.\r\n\r\nIt may well be imagined that the animals were less convinced of the\r\nnecessity of this performance than their masters.  Wonderful was the\r\nclatter and confusion, horrible the uproar raised behind to make the poor\r\nthings proceed at all, desperate the shout when some half-frantic\r\ncreature kicked or attempted a charge wild the glee when a persecuted\r\ngoat or sheep took heart of grace, and flashed for one moment between the\r\ncrackling, flaring, smoking walls.  When one cow or sheep off a farm\r\nwent, all the others were pretty sure to follow it, and the owner had\r\nthen only to be on the watch at the other end to turn them back, with\r\ntheir flame-dazzled eyes, from going unawares down the precipice, a fate\r\nfrom which the passing through the fire was evidently not supposed to\r\nensure them.  The swine, those special German delights, were of course\r\nthe most refractory of all.  Some, by dint of being pulled away from the\r\nlane of fire, were induced to rush through it; but about half-way they\r\ngenerally made a bolt, either sidelong through the flaming fence or\r\nbackwards among the legs of their persecutors, who were upset amid loud\r\nimprecations.  One huge, old, lean, high-backed sow, with a large family,\r\ntruly feminine in her want of presence of mind, actually charged into the\r\nmidst of the bonfire itself, scattering it to the right and left with her\r\nsnout, and emitting so horrible a smell of singed bacon, that it might\r\nalmost be feared that some of her progeny were anticipating the invention\r\nof Chinese roasting-pigs.  However, their proprietor, Jobst, counted them\r\nout all safe on the other side, and there only resulted some sighs and\r\nlamentations among the seniors, such as Hatto and Ursel, that it boded\r\nill to have the Needfire trodden out by an old sow.\r\n\r\nAll the castle live-stock were undergoing the same ceremony.  Eberhard\r\nconcerned himself little about the vagaries of the sheep and pigs, and\r\nonly laughed a little as the great black goat, who had seen several\r\nMidsummer nights, and stood on his guard, made a sudden short run and\r\nbutted down old Hatto, then skipped off like a chamois into the darkness,\r\nunheeding, the old rogue, the whispers that connected his unlucky hue\r\nwith the doings of the Walpurgisnacht.  But when it came to the horses,\r\nEberhard could not well endure the sight of the endeavours to force them,\r\nsnorting, rearing, and struggling, through anything so abhorrent to them\r\nas the hedge of fire.\r\n\r\nThe Schneiderlein, with all the force of his powerful arm, had hold of\r\nEberhard\xe2\x80\x99s own young white mare, who, with ears turned back, nostrils\r\ndilated, and wild eyes, her fore-feet firmly planted wide apart, was\r\nusing her whole strength for resistance; and, when a heavy blow fell on\r\nher, only plunged backwards, and kicked without advancing.  It was more\r\nthan Eberhard could endure, and Christina\xe2\x80\x99s impulse was to murmur, \xe2\x80\x9cO do\r\nnot let him do it;\xe2\x80\x9d but this he scarcely heard, as he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cWait\r\nfor me here!\xe2\x80\x9d and, as he stepped forward, sent his voice before him,\r\nforbidding all blows to the mare.\r\n\r\nThe creature\xe2\x80\x99s extreme terror ceased at once upon hearing his voice, and\r\nthere was an instant relaxation of all violence of resistance as he came\r\nup to her, took her halter from the Schneiderlein, patted her glossy\r\nneck, and spoke to her.  But the tumult of warning voices around him\r\nassured him that it would be a fatal thing to spare the steed the passage\r\nthrough the fire, and he strove by encouragements and caresses with voice\r\nand hand to get her forward, leading her himself; but the poor beast\r\ntrembled so violently, and, though making a few steps forward, stopped\r\nagain in such exceeding horror of the flame, that Eberhard had not the\r\nheart to compel her, turned her head away, and assured her that she\r\nshould not be further tormented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gracious lordship is wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said public opinion, by the voice of\r\nold Bauer Ulrich, the sacrificer of the horse\xe2\x80\x99s head.  \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forfend\r\nthat evil befall him and that mare in the course of the year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the buzz of voices concurred in telling of the recusant pigs who had\r\nnever developed into sausages, the sheep who had only escaped to be eaten\r\nby wolves, the mule whose bones had been found at the bottom of an abyss.\r\n\r\nOld Ursel was seriously concerned, and would have laid hold on her young\r\nmaster to remonstrate, but a fresh notion had arisen\xe2\x80\x94Would the gracious\r\nFreiherr set a-rolling the wheel, which was already being lighted in the\r\nfire, and was to conclude the festivities by being propelled down the\r\nhill\xe2\x80\x94figuring, only that no one present knew it, the sun\xe2\x80\x99s declension\r\nfrom his solstitial height?  Eberhard made no objection; and Christina,\r\nin her shelter by the cave, felt no little dismay at being left alone\r\nthere, and moreover had a strange, weird feeling at the wild, uncanny\r\nceremony he was engaged in, not knowing indeed that it was sun-worship,\r\nbut afraid that it could be no other than unholy sorcery.\r\n\r\nThe wheel, flaring or reddening in all its spokes, was raised from the\r\nbonfire, and was driven down the smoothest piece of green sward, which\r\nformed an inclined plane towards the stream.  If its course was smooth,\r\nand it only became extinguished by leaping into the water, the village\r\nwould flourish; and prosperity above all was expected if it should spring\r\nover the narrow channel, and attempt to run up the other side.  Such\r\nthings had happened in the days of the good Freiherren Ebbo and Friedel,\r\nthough the wheel had never gone right since the present baron had been\r\nexcommunicated; but his heir having been twice seen at mass in this last\r\nmonth great hopes were founded upon him.\r\n\r\nThere was a shout to clear the slope.  Eberhard, in great earnest and\r\nsome anxiety, accepted the gauntlet that he was offered to protect his\r\nhand, steadied the wheel therewith, and, with a vigorous impulse from\r\nhand and foot, sent it bounding down the slope, among loud cries and a\r\ngeneral scattering of the idlers who had crowded full into the very path\r\nof the fiery circle, which flamed up brilliantly for the moment as it met\r\nthe current of air.  But either there was an obstacle in the way, or the\r\nyoung Baron\xe2\x80\x99s push had not been quite straight: the wheel suddenly\r\nswerved aside, its course swerved to the right, maugre all the\r\nobjurgations addressed to it as if it had been a living thing, and the\r\nnext moment it had disappeared, all but a smoky, smouldering spot of red,\r\nthat told where it lay, charring and smoking on its side, without having\r\nfulfilled a quarter of its course.\r\n\r\nPeople drew off gravely and silently, and Eberhard himself was strangely\r\ndiscomfited when he came back to the hermitage, and, wrapping Christina\r\nin his cloak, prepared to return, so soon as the glare of the fire should\r\nhave faded from his eyesight enough to make it safe to tread so\r\nprecipitous a path.  He had indeed this day made a dangerous venture, and\r\nboth he and Christina could not but feel disheartened by the issue of all\r\nthe omens of the year, the more because she had a vague sense of wrong in\r\nconsulting or trusting them.  It seemed to her all one frightened,\r\nuncomprehended dream ever since her father had left her in the chapel;\r\nand, though conscious of her inability to have prevented her marriage,\r\nyet she blamed herself, felt despairing as she thought of the future,\r\nand, above all, dreaded the Baron and the Baroness and their anger.\r\nEberhard, after his first few words, was silent, and seemed solely\r\nabsorbed in leading her safely along the rocky path, sometimes lifting\r\nher when he thought her in danger of stumbling.  It was one of the\r\nlightest, shortest nights of the year, and a young moon added to the\r\nbrightness in open places, while in others it made the rocks and stones\r\ncast strange elvish shadows.  The distance was not entirely lost; other\r\nBeltane fires could be seen, like beacons, on every hill, and the few\r\nlights in the castle shone out like red fiery eyes in its heavy dark pile\r\nof building.\r\n\r\nBefore entering, Eberhard paused, pulled off his own wedding-ring, and\r\nput it into his bosom, and taking his bride\xe2\x80\x99s hand in his, did the same\r\nfor her, and bade her keep the ring till they could wear them openly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas! then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, \xe2\x80\x9cyou would have this secret?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless I would have to seek thee down the oubliette, my little one,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Eberhard \xe2\x80\x9cor, what might even be worse, see thee burnt on the\r\nhillside for bewitching me with thine arts!  No, indeed, my darling.\r\nWere it only my father, I could make him love thee; but my mother\xe2\x80\x94I could\r\nnot trust her where she thought the honour of our house concerned.  It\r\nshall not be for long.  Thou know\xe2\x80\x99st we are to make peace with the\r\nKaiser, and then will I get me employment among K\xc3\xbcrfurst Albrecht\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompanies of troops, and then shalt thou prank it as my Lady Freiherrinn,\r\nand teach me the ways of cities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!  I fear me it has been a great sin!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed the poor little wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor thee\xe2\x80\x94thou couldst not help it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eberhard; \xe2\x80\x9cfor me\xe2\x80\x94who knows how\r\nmany deadly ones it may hinder?  Cheer up, little one; no one can harm\r\nthee while the secret is kept.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Christina had no choice but submission; but it was a sorry bridal\r\nevening, to enter her husband\xe2\x80\x99s home in shrinking terror; with the threat\r\nof the oubliette before her, and with a sense of shame and deception\r\nhanging upon her, making the wonted scowl of the old baroness cut her\r\nboth with remorse and dread.\r\n\r\nShe did indeed sit beside her bridegroom at the supper, but how little\r\nlike a bride! even though he pushed the salt-cellar, as if by accident,\r\nbelow her place.  She thought of her myrtle, tended in vain at home by\r\nBarbara Schmidt; she thought of Ulm courtships, and how all ought to have\r\nbeen; the solemn embassage to her uncle, the stately negotiations; the\r\ntroth plight before the circle of ceremonious kindred and merry maidens,\r\nof whom she had often been one\xe2\x80\x94the subsequent attentions of the betrothed\r\non all festival days, the piles of linen and all plenishings accumulated\r\nsince babyhood, and all reviewed and laid out for general admiration (Ah!\r\npoor Aunt Johanna still spinning away to add to the many webs in her\r\nwalnut presses!)\xe2\x80\x94then the grand procession to fetch home the bride, the\r\nsplendid festival with the musicians, dishes, and guest-tables to the\r\nutmost limit that was allowed by the city laws, and the bride\xe2\x80\x99s hair so\r\njoyously covered by her matron\xe2\x80\x99s curch amid the merriment of her\r\ncompanion maidens.\r\n\r\nPoor child!  After she had crept away to her own room, glad that her\r\nfather was not yet returned, she wept bitterly over the wrong that she\r\nfelt she had done to the kind uncle and aunt, who must now look in vain\r\nfor their little Christina, and would think her lost to them, and to all\r\nelse that was good.  At least she had had the Church\xe2\x80\x99s blessing\xe2\x80\x94but that,\r\nstrange to say, was regarded, in burgher life before the Reformation, as\r\nrather the ornament of a noble marriage than as essential to the civil\r\ncontract; and a marriage by a priest was regarded by the citizens rather\r\nas a means of eluding the need of obtaining the parent\xe2\x80\x99s consent, than as\r\na more regular and devout manner of wedding.  However, Christina felt\r\nthis the one drop of peace.  The blessings and prayers were warm at her\r\nheart, and gave her hope.  And as to drops of joy, of them there was no\r\nlack, for had not she now a right to love Eberhard with all her heart and\r\nconscience, and was not it a wonderful love on his part that had made him\r\nstoop to the little white-faced burgher maid, despised even by her own\r\nfather?  O better far to wear the maiden\xe2\x80\x99s uncovered head for him than\r\nthe myrtle wreath for any one else!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\nTHE SCHNEIDERLEIN\xe2\x80\x99S RETURN\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE poor little unowned bride had more to undergo than her imagination\r\nhad conceived at the first moment.\r\n\r\nWhen she heard that the marriage was to be a secret, she had not\r\nunderstood that Eberhard was by no means disposed to observe much more\r\ncaution than mere silence.  A rough, though kindly man, he did not\r\nthoroughly comprehend the shame and confusion that he was bringing upon\r\nher by departing from his former demeanour.  He knew that, so enormous\r\nwas the distance then supposed to exist between the noble and the\r\nburgher, there was no chance of any one dreaming of the true state of the\r\ncase, and that as long as Christina was not taken for his wife, there was\r\nno personal danger for her from his mother, who\xe2\x80\x94so lax were the morals of\r\nthe German nobility with regard to all of inferior rank\xe2\x80\x94would tolerate\r\nher with complacency as his favourite toy; and he was taken by surprise\r\nat the agony of grief and shame with which she slowly comprehended his\r\nassurance that she had nothing to fear.\r\n\r\nThere was no help for it.  The oubliette would probably be the portion of\r\nthe low-born girl who had interfered with the sixteen quarterings of the\r\nAdlerstein shield, and poor Christina never stepped across its trap-door\r\nwithout a shudder lest it should open beneath her.  And her father would\r\nprobably have been hung from the highest tower, in spite of his shrewd\r\ncare to be aware of nothing.  Christina consoled herself with the hope\r\nthat he knew all the time why he had been sent out of the way, for, with\r\na broad grin that had made her blush painfully, he had said he knew she\r\nwould be well taken care of, and that he hoped she was not breaking her\r\nheart for want of an escort.  She tried to extort Eberhard\xe2\x80\x99s permission\r\nto let him at least know how it was; but Eberhard laughed, saying he\r\nbelieved the old fox knew just as much as he chose; and, in effect,\r\nSorel, though now and then gratifying his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s scruples, by serving\r\nas a shield to her meetings with the young Baron, never allowed himself\r\nto hear a hint of the true state of affairs.\r\n\r\nEberhard\xe2\x80\x99s love and reverence were undiminished, and the time spent with\r\nhim would have been perfectly happy could she ever have divested herself\r\nof anxiety and alarm; but the periods of his absence from the castle were\r\nvery terrible to her, for the other women of the household, quick to\r\nperceive that she no longer repelled him, had lost that awe that had\r\nhitherto kept them at a distance from her, and treated her with a\r\nfamiliarity, sometimes coarse, sometimes spiteful, always hateful and\r\ndegrading.  Even old Ursel had become half-pitying, half-patronizing; and\r\nthe old Baroness, though not molesting her, took not the slightest notice\r\nof her.\r\n\r\nThis state of things lasted much longer than there had been reason to\r\nexpect at the time of the marriage.  The two Freiherren then intended to\r\nset out in a very short time to make their long talked-of submission to\r\nthe Emperor at Ratisbon; but, partly from their German tardiness of\r\nmovement, partly from the obstinate delays interposed by the proud old\r\nFreiherrinn, who was as averse as ever to the measure, partly from\r\nreports that the Court was not yet arrived at Ratisbon, the expedition\r\nwas again and again deferred, and did not actually take place till\r\nSeptember was far advanced.\r\n\r\nPoor Christina would have given worlds to go with them, and even\r\nentreated to be sent to Ulm with an avowal of her marriage to her uncle\r\nand aunt, but of this Eberhard would not hear.  He said the Ulmers would\r\nthus gain an hostage, and hamper his movements; and, if her wedding was\r\nnot to be confessed\xe2\x80\x94poor child!\xe2\x80\x94she could better bear to remain where she\r\nwas than to face Hausfrau Johanna.  Eberhard was fully determined to\r\nenrol himself in some troop, either Imperial, or, if not, among the Free\r\nCompanies, among whom men of rank were often found, and he would then\r\nfetch or send for his wife and avow her openly, so soon as she should be\r\nout of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s reach.  He longed to leave her father at home, to be\r\nsome protection to her, but Hugh Sorel was so much the most intelligent\r\nand skilful of the retainers as to be absolutely indispensable to the\r\nparty\xe2\x80\x94he was their only scribe; and moreover his new suit of buff\r\nrendered him a creditable member of a troop that had been very hard to\r\nequip.  It numbered about ten men-at-arms, only three being left at home\r\nto garrison the castle\xe2\x80\x94namely, Hatto, who was too old to take; Hans, who\r\nhad been hopelessly lame and deformed since the old Baron had knocked him\r\noff a cliff in a passion; and Squinting M\xc3\xa4tz, a runaway servant, who had\r\nmurdered his master, the mayor of Strasburg, and might be caught and put\r\nto death if any one recognized him.  If needful the villagers could\r\nalways be called in to defend the castle: but of this there was little or\r\nno danger\xe2\x80\x94the Eagle\xe2\x80\x99s Steps were defence enough in themselves, and the\r\nparty were not likely to be absent more than a week or ten days\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ngrievous length of time, poor Christina thought, as she stood straining\r\nher eyes on the top of the watch-tower, to watch them as far as possible\r\nalong the plain.  Her heart was very sad, and the omen of the burning\r\nwheel so continually haunted her that even in her sleep that night she\r\nsaw its brief course repeated, beheld its rapid fall and extinction, and\r\nthen tracked the course of the sparks that darted from it, one rising and\r\ngleaming high in air till it shone like a star, another pursuing a fitful\r\nand irregular, but still bright course amid the dry grass on the\r\nhillside, just as she had indeed watched some of the sparks on that\r\nnight, minding her of the words of the Allhallow-tide legend: \xe2\x80\x9c_Fulgebunt\r\njusti et tanquam scintill\xc3\xa6 in arundinete discurrent_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a sentence which\r\nremained with her when awake, and led her to seek it out in her Latin\r\nBible in the morning.\r\n\r\nReluctantly had she gone down to the noontide meal, feeling, though her\r\nhusband and father were far less of guardians than they should have been,\r\nyet that there was absolute rest, peace, and protection in their presence\r\ncompared with what it was to be alone with Freiherrinn Kunigunde and her\r\nrude women without them.  A few sneers on her daintiness and uselessness\r\nhad led her to make an offer of assisting in the grand chopping of\r\nsausage meat and preparation of winter stores, and she had been answered\r\nwith contempt that my young lord would not have her soil her delicate\r\nhands, when one of the maids who had been sent to fetch beer from the\r\ncellar came back with startled looks, and the exclamation, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is the\r\nSchneiderlein riding up the Eagle\xe2\x80\x99s Ladder upon Freiherr Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s white\r\nmare!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the women sprang up together, and rushed to the window, whence they\r\ncould indeed recognize both man and horse; and presently it became plain\r\nthat both were stained with blood, weary, and spent; indeed, nothing but\r\nextreme exhaustion would have induced the man-at-arms to trust the tired,\r\nstumbling horse up such a perilous path.\r\n\r\nLoud were the exclamations, \xe2\x80\x9cAh! no good could come of not leading that\r\nmare through the Johannisfeuer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis shameful expedition!  Only harm could befall.  This is thy doing,\r\nthou mincing city-girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll was certain to go wrong when a pale mist widow came into the place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe angry and dismayed cries all blended themselves in confusion in the\r\nears of the only silent woman present; the only one that sounded\r\ndistinctly on her brain was that of the last speaker, \xe2\x80\x9cA pale, mist\r\nwidow,\xe2\x80\x9d as, holding herself a little in the rear of the struggling,\r\njostling little mob of women, who hardly made way even for their\r\nacknowledged lady, she followed with failing limbs the universal rush to\r\nthe entrance as soon as man and horse had mounted the slope and were lost\r\nsight of.\r\n\r\nA few moments more, and the throng of expectants was at the foot of the\r\nhall steps, just as the lanzknecht reached the arched entrance.  His\r\ncomrade Hans took his bridle, and almost lifted him from his horse; he\r\nreeled and stumbled as, pale, battered, and bleeding, he tried to advance\r\nto Freiherinn Kunigunde, and, in answer to her hasty interrogation,\r\nfaltered out, \xe2\x80\x9cIll news, gracious lady.  We have been set upon by the\r\naccursed Schlangenwaldern, and I am the only living man left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristina scarce heard even these last words; senses and powers alike\r\nfailed her, and she sank back on the stone steps in a deathlike swoon.\r\n\r\nWhen she came to herself she was lying on her bed, Ursel and Else,\r\nanother of the women, busy over her, and Ursel\xe2\x80\x99s voice was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cAh,\r\nshe is coming round.  Look up, sweet lady, and fear not.  You are our\r\ngracious Lady Baroness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he here?  O, has he said so?  O, let me see him\xe2\x80\x94Sir Eberhard,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nfaintly cried Christina with sobbing breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, no, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman; \xe2\x80\x9cbut see here,\xe2\x80\x9d and she lifted up\r\nChristina\xe2\x80\x99s powerless, bloodless hand, and showed her the ring on the\r\nfinger.  Her bosom had been evidently searched when her dress was\r\nloosened in her swoon, and her ring found and put in its place.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere,\r\nyou can hold up your head with the best of them; he took care of that\xe2\x80\x94my\r\ndear young Freiherr, the boy that I nursed,\xe2\x80\x9d and the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s burst of\r\ntears brought back the truth to Christina\xe2\x80\x99s reviving senses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, trying to raise herself, \xe2\x80\x9cwas it indeed so?  O\r\nsay it was not as he said!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, woe\xe2\x80\x99s me, woe\xe2\x80\x99s me, that it was even so,\xe2\x80\x9d lamented Ursel; \xe2\x80\x9cbut oh,\r\nbe still, look not so wild, dear lady.  The dear, true-hearted young\r\nlord, he spent his last breath in owning you for his true lady, and in\r\nbidding us cherish you and our young baron that is to be.  And the\r\ngracious lady below\xe2\x80\x94she owns you; there is no fear of her now; so vex not\r\nyourself, dearest, most gracious lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristina did not break out into the wailing and weeping that the old\r\nnurse expected; she was still far too much stunned and overwhelmed, and\r\nshe entreated to be told all, lying still, but gazing at Ursel with\r\npiteous bewildered eyes.  Ursel and Else helping one another out, tried\r\nto tell her, but they were much confused; all they knew was that the\r\nparty had been surprised at night in a village hostel by the\r\nSchlangenwaldern, and all slain, though the young Baron had lived long\r\nenough to charge the Schneiderlein with his commendation of his wife to\r\nhis mother; but all particulars had been lost in the general confusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, let me see the Schneiderlein,\xe2\x80\x9d implored Christina, by this time able\r\nto rise and cross the room to the large carved chair; and Ursel\r\nimmediately turned to her underling, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cTell the Schneiderlein that\r\nthe gracious Lady Baroness desires his presence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElse\xe2\x80\x99s wooden shoes clattered down stairs, but the next moment she\r\nreturned.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe cannot come; he is quite spent, and he will let no one\r\ntouch his arm till Ursel can come, not even to get off his doublet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, and, revived by the sense of being\r\nwanted, she moved at once to the turret, where she kept some rag and some\r\nointment, which she had found needful in the latter stages of\r\nErmentrude\xe2\x80\x99s illness\xe2\x80\x94indeed, household surgery was a part of regular\r\nfemale education, and Christina had had plenty of practice in helping her\r\ncharitable aunt, so that the superiority of her skill to that of Ursel\r\nhad long been avowed in the castle.  Ursel made no objection further than\r\nto look for something that could be at once converted into a widow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nveil\xe2\x80\x94being in the midst of her grief quite alive to the need that no\r\nmatronly badge should be omitted\xe2\x80\x94but nothing came to hand in time, and\r\nChristina was descending the stairs, on her way to the kitchen, where she\r\nfound the fugitive man-at-arms seated on a rough settle, his head and\r\nwounded arm resting on the table, while groans of pain, weariness, and\r\nimpatience were interspersed with imprecations on the stupid awkward\r\ngirls who surrounded him.\r\n\r\nPity and the instinct of affording relief must needs take the precedence\r\neven of the desire to hear of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s fate; and, as the girls\r\nhastily whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cHere she is,\xe2\x80\x9d and the lanzknecht hastily tried to\r\ngather himself up, and rise with tokens of respect; she bade him remain\r\nstill, and let her see what she could do for him.  In fact, she at once\r\nperceived that he was in no condition to give a coherent account of\r\nanything, he was so completely worn out, and in so much suffering.  She\r\nbade at once that some water should be heated, and some of the broth of\r\nthe dinner set on the fire; then with the shears at her girdle, and her\r\nsoft, light fingers, she removed the torn strip of cloth that had been\r\nwound round the arm, and cut away the sleeve, showing the arm not broken,\r\nbut gashed at the shoulder, and thence the whole length grazed and\r\nwounded by the descent of the sword down to the wrist.  So tender was her\r\ntouch, that he scarcely winced or moaned under her hand; and, when she\r\nproceeded, with Ursel\xe2\x80\x99s help, to bathe the wound with the warm water, the\r\nrelief was such that the wearied man absolutely slumbered during the\r\nprocess, which Christina protracted on that very account.  She then\r\ndressed and bandaged the arm, and proceeded to skim\xe2\x80\x94as no one else in the\r\ncastle would do\xe2\x80\x94the basin of soup, with which she then fed her patient as\r\nhe leant back in the corner of the settle, at first in the same\r\nsomnolent, half-conscious state in which he had been ever since the\r\nrelief from the severe pain; but after a few spoonfuls the light and life\r\ncame back to his eye, and he broke out, \xe2\x80\x9cThanks, thanks, gracious lady!\r\nThis is the Lady Baroness for me!  My young lord was the only wise man!\r\nThanks, lady; now am I my own man again.  It had been long ere the old\r\nFreiherrinn had done so much for me!  I am your man, lady, for life or\r\ndeath!\xe2\x80\x9d  And, before she knew what he was about, the gigantic\r\nSchneiderlein had slid down on his knees, seized her hand, and kissed\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94the first act of homage to her rank, but most startling and\r\ndistressing to her.  \xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d she faltered, \xe2\x80\x9cprithee do not; thou must\r\nrest.  Only if\xe2\x80\x94if thou canst only tell me if he, my own dear lord, sent\r\nme any greeting, I would wait to hear the rest till thou hast slept.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! the dog of Schlangenwald!\xe2\x80\x9d was the first answer; then, as he\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, lady, we had ridden merrily as far as Jacob M\xc3\xbcller\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhostel, the traitor,\xe2\x80\x9d it became plain that he meant to begin at the\r\nbeginning.  She allowed Ursel to seat her on the bench opposite to his\r\nsettle, and, leaning forward, heard his narrative like one in a dream.\r\nThere, the Schneiderlein proceeded to say, they put up for the night,\r\nentirely unsuspicious of evil; Jacob M\xc3\xbcller, who was known to himself, as\r\nwell as to Sorel and to the others, assuring them that the way was clear\r\nto Ratisbon, and that he heard the Emperor was most favourably disposed\r\nto any noble who would tender his allegiance.  Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s liquors were\r\nbrought out, and were still in course of being enjoyed, when the house\r\nwas suddenly surrounded by an overpowering number of the retainers of\r\nSchlangenwald, with their Count himself at their head.  He had been\r\nevidently resolved to prevent the timely submission of the enemies of his\r\nrace, and suddenly presenting himself before the elder Baron, had\r\nchallenged him to instantaneous battle, claiming credit to himself for\r\nnot having surprised them when asleep.  The disadvantage had been\r\nscarcely less than if this had been the case, for the Adlersteinern were\r\nall half-intoxicated, and far inferior in numbers\xe2\x80\x94at least, on the\r\nshowing of the Schneiderlein\xe2\x80\x94and a desperate fight had ended by his being\r\nflung aside in a corner, bound fast by the ankles and wrists, the only\r\nliving prisoner, except his young lord, who, having several terrible\r\nwounds, the worst in his chest, was left unbound.\r\n\r\nBoth lay helpless, untended, and silent, while the revel that had been so\r\nfatal to them was renewed by their captors, who finally all sunk into a\r\nheavy sleep.  The torches were not all spent, and the moonlight shone\r\ninto the room, when the Schneiderlein, desperate from the agony caused by\r\nthe ligature round his wounded arm, sat up and looked about him.  A knife\r\nthrown aside by one of the drunkards lay near enough to be grasped by his\r\nbound hands, and he had just reached it when Sir Eberhard made a sign to\r\nhim to put it into his hand, and therewith contrived to cut the rope\r\nround both hands and feet\xe2\x80\x94then pointed to the door.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to hinder an escape; the men slept the sleep of the\r\ndrunken; but the Schneiderlein, with the rough fidelity of a retainer,\r\nwould have lingered with a hope of saving his master.  But Eberhard shook\r\nhis head, and signed again to escape; then, making him bend down close to\r\nhim, he used all his remaining power to whisper, as he pressed his sword\r\ninto the retainer\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo home; tell my mother\xe2\x80\x94all the world\xe2\x80\x94that Christina Sorel is my wife,\r\nwedded on the Friedmund Wake by Friar Peter of Offingen, and if she\r\nshould bear a child, he is my true and lawful heir.  My sword for him\xe2\x80\x94my\r\nlove to her.  And if my mother would not be haunted by me, let her take\r\ncare of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words were spoken with extreme difficulty, for the nature of the\r\nwound made utterance nearly impossible, and each broken sentence cost a\r\nterrible effusion of blood.  The final words brought on so choking and\r\nfatal a gush that, said the Schneiderlein, \xe2\x80\x9che fell back as I tried to\r\nhold him up, and I saw that it was all at an end, and a kind and friendly\r\nmaster and lord gone from me.  I laid him down, and put his cross on his\r\nbreast that I had seen him kissing many a time that evening; and I\r\ncrossed his hands, and wiped the blood from them and his face.  And,\r\nlady, he had put on his ring; I trust the robber caitiff\xe2\x80\x99s may have left\r\nit to him in his grave.  And so I came forth, walking soft, and opening\r\nthe door in no small dread, not of the snoring swine, but of the dogs\r\nwithout.  But happily they were still, and even by the door I saw all our\r\npoor fellows stark and stiff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Christina.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! with his head cleft open by the Graf himself.  He died like a true\r\nsoldier, lady, and we have lost the best head among us in him.  Well, the\r\nknave that should have watched the horses was as drunken as the rest of\r\nthem, and I made a shift to put the bridle on the white mare and ride\r\noff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch was the narrative of the Schneiderlein, and all that was left to\r\nChristina was the picture of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s dying effort to guard her, and\r\nthe haunting fancy of those long hours of speechless agony on the floor\r\nof the hostel, and how direful must have been his fears for her.  Sad and\r\novercome, yet not sinking entirely while any work of comfort remained,\r\nher heart yearned over her companion in misfortune, the mother who had\r\nlost both husband and son; and all her fears of the dread Freiherrinn\r\ncould not prevent her from bending her steps, trembling and palpitating\r\nas she was, towards the hall, to try whether the daughter-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s right\r\nmight be vouchsafed to her, of weeping with the elder sufferer.\r\n\r\nThe Freiherrinn sat by the chimney, rocking herself to and fro, and\r\nholding consultation with Hatto.  She started as she saw Christina\r\napproaching, and made a gesture of repulsion; but, with the feeling of\r\nbeing past all terror in this desolate moment, Christina stepped nearer,\r\nknelt, and, clasping her hands, said, \xe2\x80\x9cYour pardon, lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the harsh voice, even harsher for very grief, \xe2\x80\x9cthou\r\nhast naught to fear, girl.  As things stand, thou canst not have thy\r\ndeserts.  Dost hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, lady, it was not such pardon that I meant.  If you would let me be a\r\ndaughter to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA daughter!  A wood-carver\xe2\x80\x99s girl to be a daughter of Adlerstein!\xe2\x80\x9d half\r\nlaughed the grim Baroness.  \xe2\x80\x9cCome here, wench,\xe2\x80\x9d and Christina underwent a\r\nseries of sharp searching questions on the evidences of her marriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo,\xe2\x80\x9d ended the old lady, \xe2\x80\x9csince better may not be, we must own thee for\r\nthe nonce.  Hark ye all, this is the Frau Freiherrinn, Freiherr\r\nEberhard\xe2\x80\x99s widow, to be honoured as such,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, raising her voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, girl, thou hast what thou didst strive for.  Is not that enough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas! lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, her eyes swimming in tears, \xe2\x80\x9cI would fain\r\nhave striven to be a comforter, or to weep together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! to bewitch me as thou didst my poor son and daughter, and\r\nwell-nigh my lord himself!  Girl!  Girl!  Thou know\xe2\x80\x99st I cannot burn thee\r\nnow; but away with thee; try not my patience too far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, more desolate than ever, the crushed and broken-hearted Christina, a\r\nwidow before she had been owned a wife, returned to the room that was now\r\nso full of memories as to be even more home than Master Gottfried\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngallery at Ulm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\nPASSING THE OUBLIETTE\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO can describe the dreariness of being snowed-up all the winter with\r\nsuch a mother-in-law as Freiherrinn Kunigunde?\r\n\r\nYet it was well that the snow came early, for it was the best defence of\r\nthe lonely castle from any attack on the part of the Schlangenwaldern,\r\nthe Swabian League, or the next heir, Freiherr Kasimir von Adlerstein\r\nWildschloss.  The elder Baroness had, at least, the merit of a stout\r\nheart, and, even with her sadly-reduced garrison, feared none of them.\r\nShe had been brought up in the faith that Adlerstein was impregnable, and\r\nso she still believed; and, if the disaster that had cut off her husband\r\nand son was to happen at all, she was glad that it had befallen before\r\nthe homage had been paid.  Probably the Schlangenwald Count knew how\r\ntough a morsel the castle was like to prove, and Wildschloss was serving\r\nat a distance, for nothing was heard of either during the short interval\r\nwhile the roads were still open.  During this time an attempt had been\r\nmade through Father Norbert to ascertain what had become of the corpses\r\nof the two Barons and their followers, and it had appeared that the Count\r\nhad carried them all off from the inn, no doubt to adorn his castle with\r\ntheir limbs, or to present them to the Emperor in evidence of his zeal\r\nfor order.  The old Baron could not indeed have been buried in\r\nconsecrated ground, nor have masses said for him; but for the weal of her\r\nson\xe2\x80\x99s soul Dame Kunigunde gave some of her few ornaments, and Christina\r\nadded her gold earrings, and all her scanty purse, that both her husband\r\nand father might be joined in the prayers of the Church\xe2\x80\x94trying with all\r\nher might to put confidence in Hugh Sorel\xe2\x80\x99s Loretto relic, and the\r\nIndulgence he had bought, and trusting with more consolatory thoughts to\r\nthe ever stronger dawnings of good she had watched in her own Eberhard.\r\n\r\nShe had some consoling intercourse with the priest while all this was\r\npending; but throughout the winter she was entirely cut off from every\r\ncreature save the inmates of the castle, where, as far as the old lady\r\nwas concerned, she only existed on sufferance, and all her meekness and\r\ngentleness could not win for her more than the barest toleration.\r\n\r\nThat Eberhard had for a few hours survived his father, and that thus the\r\nFreiherrinn Christina was as much the Dowager Baroness as Kunigunde\r\nherself, was often insisted on in the kitchen by Ursel, Hatto, and the\r\nSchneiderlein, whom Christina had unconsciously rendered her most devoted\r\nservant, not only by her daily care of his wound, but by her kind\r\ncourteous words, and by her giving him his proper name of Heinz, dropping\r\nthe absurd _nom de guerre_ of the Schneiderlein, or little tailor, which\r\nhad been originally conferred on him in allusion to the valiant\r\nTailorling who boasted of having killed seven flies at a blow, and had\r\nbeen carried on chiefly because of the contradiction between such a title\r\nand his huge brawny strength and fierce courage.  Poor Eberhard, with his\r\nundaunted bravery and free reckless good-nature, a ruffian far more by\r\neducation than by nature, had been much loved by his followers.  His\r\nwidow would have reaped the benefit of that affection even if her\r\nexceeding sweetness had not gained it on her own account; and this giant\r\nwas completely gained over to her, when, amid all her sorrow and\r\nfeebleness, she never failed to minister to his sufferings to the utmost,\r\nwhile her questions about his original home, and revival of the name of\r\nhis childhood, softened him, and awoke in him better feelings.  He would\r\nhave died to serve her, and she might have headed an opposition party in\r\nthe castle, had she not been quite indifferent to all save her grief;\r\nand, except by sitting above the salt at the empty table, she laid no\r\nclaim to any honours or authority, and was more seldom than ever seen\r\nbeyond what was now called her own room.\r\n\r\nAt last, when for the second time she was seeing the snow wreaths\r\ndwindle, and the drops shine forth in moisture again, while the mountain\r\npaths were set free by the might of the springtide sun, she spoke almost\r\nfor the first time with authority, as she desired Heinz to saddle her\r\nmule, and escort her to join in the Easter mass at the Blessed\r\nFriedmund\xe2\x80\x99s Chapel.  Ursel heaped up objections; but so urgent was\r\nChristina for confession and for mass, that the old woman had not the\r\nheart to stop her by a warning to the elder Baroness, and took the\r\nalternative of accompanying her.  It was a glorious sparkling Easter Day,\r\nlovely blue sky above, herbage and flowers glistening below, snow\r\ndazzling in the hollows, peasants assembling in holiday garb, and all\r\nrejoicing.  Even the lonely widow, in her heavy veil and black mufflings,\r\ntook hope back to her heart, and smiled when at the church door a little\r\nchild came timidly up to her with a madder-tinted Easter egg\xe2\x80\x94a gift once\r\nagain like the happy home customs of Ulm.  She gave the child a kiss\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nhad nothing else to give, but the sweet face sent it away strangely glad.\r\n\r\nThe festival mass in all its exultation was not fully over, when anxious\r\nfaces began to be seen at the door, and whisperings went round and many\r\npassed out.  Nobody at Adlerstein was particular about silence in church,\r\nand, when the service was not in progress, voices were not even lowered,\r\nand, after many attempts on the part of the Schneiderlein to attract the\r\nattention of his mistress, his voice immediately succeeded the _Ite missa\r\nest_, \xe2\x80\x9cGracious lady, we must begone.  Your mule is ready.  There is a\r\nparty at the Debateable Ford, whether Schlangenwald or Wildschloss we\r\nknow not yet, but either way you must be the first thing placed in\r\nsafety.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristina turned deadly pale.  She had long been ready to welcome death\r\nas a peaceful friend; but, sheltered as her girlhood had been in the\r\nquiet city, she had never been brought in contact with warfare, and her\r\nnervous, timid temperament made the thought most appalling and frightful\r\nto her, certain as she was that the old Baroness would resist to the\r\nuttermost.  Father Norbert saw her extreme terror, and, with the thought\r\nthat he might comfort and support her, perhaps mediate between the\r\ncontending parties, plead that it was holy-tide, and proclaim the peace\r\nof the church, or at the worst protect the lady herself, he offered his\r\ncompany; but, though she thanked him, it was as if she scarcely\r\nunderstood his kindness, and a shudder passed over her whenever the\r\nserfs, hastily summoned to augment the garrison, came hurrying down the\r\npath, or turned aside into the more rugged and shorter descents.  It was\r\nstrange, the good father thought, that so timorous and fragile a being\r\nshould have her lot cast amid these rugged places and scenes of violence,\r\nwith no one to give her the care and cherishing she so much required.\r\n\r\nEven when she crept up the castle stairs, she was met with an angry\r\nrebuke, not so much for the peril she had incurred as for having taken\r\naway the Schneiderlein, by far the most availing among the scanty remnant\r\nof the retainers of Adlerstein.  Attempting no answer, and not even\r\ndaring to ask from what quarter came the alarm, Christina made her way\r\nout of the turmoil to that chamber of her own, the scene of so much fear\r\nand sorrow, and yet of some share of peace and happiness.  But from the\r\nwindow, near the fast subsiding waters of the Debateable Ford, could\r\nplainly be seen the small troop of warriors, of whom Jobst the Kohler had\r\nbrought immediate intelligence.  The sun glistened on their armour, and a\r\nbanner floated gaily on the wind; but they were a fearful sight to the\r\ninmates of the lonely castle.\r\n\r\nA stout heart was however Kunigunde\xe2\x80\x99s best endowment; and, with the\r\nsteadiness and precision of a general, her commands rang out, as she\r\narranged and armed her garrison, perfectly resolved against any\r\nsubmission, and confident in the strength of her castle; nay, not without\r\na hope of revenge either against Schlangenwald or Wildschloss, whom, as a\r\ndegenerate Adlerstein, she hated only less than the slayer of her husband\r\nand son.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon of Easter Day however passed away without any movement on\r\nthe part of the enemy, and it was not till the following day that they\r\ncould be seen struggling through the ford, and preparing to ascend the\r\nmountain.  Attacks had sometimes been disconcerted by posting men in the\r\nmost dangerous passes; but, in the lack of numbers, and of trustworthy\r\ncommanders, the Freiherrinn had judged it wiser to trust entirely to her\r\nwalls, and keep her whole force within them.\r\n\r\nThe new comers could hardly have had any hostile intentions, for, though\r\nwell armed and accoutred, their numbers did not exceed twenty-five.  The\r\nbanner borne at their head was an azure one, with a white eagle, and\r\ntheir leader could be observed looking with amazement at the top of the\r\nwatch-tower, where the same eagle had that morning been hoisted for the\r\nfirst time since the fall of the two Freiherren.\r\n\r\nSo soon as the ascent had been made, the leader wound his horn, and,\r\nbefore the echoes had died away among the hills, Hatto, acting as\r\nseneschal, was demanding his purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Kasimir von Adlerstein Wildschloss,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.  \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nhitherto been hindered by stress of weather from coming to take\r\npossession of my inheritance.  Admit me, that I may arrange with the\r\nwidowed Frau Freiherrinn as to her dower and residence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe widowed Frau Freiherrinn, born of Adlerstein,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Hatto,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthanks the Freiherr von Adlerstein Wildschloss; but she holds the castle\r\nas guardian to the present head of the family, the Freiherr von\r\nAdlerstein.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is false, old man,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Wildschloss; \xe2\x80\x9cthe Freiherr had no\r\nother son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hatto, \xe2\x80\x9cbut Freiherr Eberhard hath left us twin heirs, our\r\nyoung lords, for whom we hold this castle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis trifling will not serve!\xe2\x80\x9d sternly spoke the knight.  \xe2\x80\x9cEberhard von\r\nAdlerstein died unmarried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Hatto, \xe2\x80\x9cour gracious Frau Freiherrinn, the younger,\r\nwas wedded to him at the last Friedmund Wake, by the special blessing of\r\nour good patron, who would not see our house extinct.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must see thy lady, old man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Kasimir, impatiently, not in the\r\nleast crediting the story, and believing his cousin Kunigunde quite\r\ncapable of any measure that could preserve to her the rule in Schloss\r\nAdlerstein, even to erecting some passing love affair of her son\xe2\x80\x99s into a\r\nmarriage.  And he hardly did her injustice, for she had never made any\r\ninquiry beyond the castle into the validity of Christina\xe2\x80\x99s espousals, nor\r\nsought after the friar who had performed the ceremony.  She consented to\r\nan interview with the claimant of the inheritance, and descended to the\r\ngateway for the purpose.  The court was at its cleanest, the thawing snow\r\nhaving newly washed away its impurities, and her proud figure, under her\r\nblack hood and veil, made an imposing appearance as she stood tall and\r\ndefiant in the archway.\r\n\r\nSir Kasimir was a handsome man of about thirty, of partly Polish descent,\r\nand endowed with Slavonic grace and courtesy, and he had likewise been\r\nemployed in negotiations with Burgundy, and had acquired much polish and\r\nknowledge of the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI regret to disturb and intrude on a mourning family,\r\nbut I am much amazed at the tidings I have heard; and I must pray of you\r\nto confirm them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought they would confound you,\xe2\x80\x9d composedly replied Kunigunde.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pardon me, lady, but the Diet is very nice in requiring full proofs.\r\nI would be glad to learn what lady was chosen by my deceased cousin\r\nEberhard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lady is Christina, daughter of his esquire, Hugh Sorel, of an\r\nhonourable family at Ulm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!  I know who and what Sorel was!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Wildschloss.  \xe2\x80\x9cLady\r\ncousin, thou wouldst not stain the shield of Adlerstein with owning aught\r\nthat cannot bear the examination of the Diet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Kasimir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kunigunde proudly, \xe2\x80\x9chad I known the truth ere my\r\nson\xe2\x80\x99s death, I had strangled the girl with mine own hands!  But I learnt\r\nit only by his dying confession; and, had she been a beggar\xe2\x80\x99s child, she\r\nwas his wedded wife, and her babes are his lawful heirs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnowest thou time\xe2\x80\x94place\xe2\x80\x94witnesses?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Sir Kasimir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time, the Friedmund Wake; the place, the Friedmund Chapel,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nthe Baroness.  \xe2\x80\x9cCome hither, Schneiderlein.  Tell the knight thy young\r\nlord\xe2\x80\x99s confession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bore emphatic testimony to poor Eberhard\xe2\x80\x99s last words; but as to the\r\npoint of who had performed the ceremony, he knew not,\xe2\x80\x94his mind had not\r\nretained the name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must see the Frau herself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildschloss, feeling certain that\r\nsuch a being as he expected in a daughter of the dissolute lanzknecht\r\nSorel would soon, by dexterous questioning, be made to expose the\r\nfutility of her pretensions so flagrantly that even Kunigunde could not\r\nattempt to maintain them.\r\n\r\nFor one moment Kunigunde hesitated, but suddenly a look of malignant\r\nsatisfaction crossed her face.  She spoke a few words to Squinting M\xc3\xa4tz,\r\nand then replied that Sir Kasimir should be allowed to satisfy himself,\r\nbut that she could admit no one else into the castle; hers was a widow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhousehold, the twins were only a few hours old, and she could not open\r\nher gates to admit any person besides himself.\r\n\r\nSo resolved on judging for himself was Adlerstein Wildschloss that all\r\nthis did not stagger him; for, even if he had believed more than he did\r\nof the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s story, there would have been no sense of intrusion or\r\nimpropriety in such a visit to the mother.  Indeed, had Christina been\r\nliving in the civilized world, her chamber would have been hung with\r\nblack cloth, black velvet would have enveloped her up to the eyes, and\r\nthe blackest of cradles would have stood ready for her fatherless babe;\r\ntwo steps, in honour of her baronial rank, would have led to her bed, and\r\na beaufet with the due baronial amount of gold and silver plate would\r\nhave held the comfits and caudle to be dispensed to all visitors.  As it\r\nwas, the two steps built into the floor of the room, and the black hood\r\nthat Ursel tied over her young mistress\xe2\x80\x99s head, were the only traces that\r\nsuch etiquette had ever been heard of.\r\n\r\nBut when Baron Kasimir had clanked up the turret stairs, each step\r\nbringing to her many a memory of him who should have been there, and when\r\nhe had been led to the bedside, he was completely taken by surprise.\r\n\r\nInstead of the great, flat-faced, coarse comeliness of a German wench,\r\ntreated as a lady in order to deceive him, he saw a delicate, lily-like\r\nface, white as ivory, and the soft, sweet brown eyes under their drooping\r\nlashes, so full of innocence and sad though thankful content, that he\r\nfelt as if the inquiries he came to make were almost sacrilege.\r\n\r\nHe had seen enough of the world to know that no agent in a clumsy\r\nimposition would look like this pure white creature, with her arm\r\nencircling the two little swaddled babes, whose red faces and bald heads\r\nalone were allowed to appear above their mummy-like wrappings; and he\r\ncould only make an obeisance lower and infinitely more respectful than\r\nthat with which he had favoured the Baroness _n\xc3\xa9e_ von Adlerstein, with a\r\nfew words of inquiry and apology.\r\n\r\nBut Christina had her sons\xe2\x80\x99 rights to defend now, and she had far more\r\nspirit to do so than ever she had had in securing her own position, and a\r\ndelicate rose tint came into her cheek as she said in her soft voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Baroness tells me, that you, noble sir, would learn who wedded me to\r\nmy dear and blessed lord, Sir Eberhard.  It was Friar Peter of the\r\nFranciscan brotherhood of Offingen, an agent for selling indulgences.\r\nTwo of his lay brethren were present.  My dear lord gave his own name and\r\nmine in full after the holy rite; the friar promising his testimony if it\r\nwere needed.  He is to be found, or at least heard of, at his own\r\ncloister; and the hermit at the chapel likewise beheld a part of the\r\nceremony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough, enough, lady,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sir Kasimir; \xe2\x80\x9cforgive me for having\r\nforced the question upon you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Christina, with her blush deepening, \xe2\x80\x9cit is but just and\r\ndue to us all;\xe2\x80\x9d and her soft eyes had a gleam of exultation, as she\r\nlooked at the two little mummies that made up the _us_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI would have all\r\ninquiries made in full.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey shall be made, lady, as will be needful for the establishment of\r\nyour son\xe2\x80\x99s right as a free Baron of the empire, but not with any doubt on\r\nmy part, or desire to controvert that right.  I am fully convinced, and\r\nonly wish to serve you and my little cousins.  Which of them is the head\r\nof our family?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, looking at the two absolutely undistinguishable\r\nlittle chrysalises, so exactly alike that Christina herself was obliged\r\nto look for the black ribbon, on which a medal had been hung, round the\r\nneck of the elder.  Sir Kasimir put one knee to the ground as he kissed\r\nthe red cheek of the infant and the white hand of the mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Kunigunde, who had stood by all this time with\r\nan anxious, uneasy, scowling expression on her face, \xe2\x80\x9cI am satisfied.  I\r\nown this babe as the true Freiherr von Adlerstein, and far be it from me\r\nto trouble his heritage.  Rather point out the way in which I may serve\r\nyou and him.  Shall I represent all to the Emperor, and obtain his\r\nwardship, so as to be able to protect you from any attacks by the enemies\r\nof the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the elder lady, severely, seeing Christina\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngratified, imploring face.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe right line of Adlerstein can take care\r\nof itself without greedy guardians appointed by usurpers.  Our submission\r\nhas never been made, and the Emperor cannot dispose of our wardship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Kunigunde looked defiant, regarding herself and her grandson as quite\r\nas good as the Emperor, and ready to blast her daughter-in-law with her\r\neyes for murmuring gratefully and wistfully, \xe2\x80\x9cThanks, noble sir, thanks!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me at least win a friendly right in my young cousins,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir\r\nKasimir, the more drawn by pitying admiration towards their mother, as he\r\nperceived more of the grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s haughty repulsiveness and want of\r\ncomprehension of the dangers of her position.  \xe2\x80\x9cThey are not baptized?\r\nLet me become their godfather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristina\xe2\x80\x99s face was all joy and gratitude, and even the grandmother made\r\nno objection; in fact, it was the babes\xe2\x80\x99 only chance of a noble sponsor;\r\nand Father Norbert, who had already been making ready for the baptism,\r\nwas sent for from the hall.  Kunigunde, meantime, moved about restlessly,\r\nwent half-way down the stairs, and held council with some one there;\r\nUrsel likewise, bustled about, and Sir Kasimir remained seated on the\r\nchair that had been placed for him near Christina\xe2\x80\x99s bed.\r\n\r\nShe was able again to thank him, and add, \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be that you will have\r\nmore cause than the lady grandmother thinks to remember your offer of\r\nprotection to my poor orphans.  Their father and grandfather were, in\r\nvery deed, on their way to make submission.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is well known to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Kasimir.  \xe2\x80\x9cLady, I will do all in my\r\npower for you.  The Emperor shall hear the state of things; and, while no\r\nviolence is offered to travellers,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, lowering his tone, \xe2\x80\x9cI doubt\r\nnot he will wait for full submission till this young Baron be of age to\r\ntender it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are scarce in force to offer violence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina sighing.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave no power to withstand the Lady Baroness.  I am like a stranger here;\r\nbut, oh! sir, if the Emperor and Diet will be patient and forbearing with\r\nthis desolate house, my babes, if they live, shall strive to requite\r\ntheir mercy by loyalty.  And the blessing of the widow and fatherless\r\nwill fall on you, most generous knight,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, fervently, holding\r\nout her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would I could do more for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight.  \xe2\x80\x9cAsk, and all I can\r\ndo is at your service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Christina, her eyes brightening, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is one most\r\ninestimable service you could render me\xe2\x80\x94to let my uncle, Master\r\nGottfried, the wood-carver of Ulm, know where I am, and of my state, and\r\nof my children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Kasimir repeated the name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere was my home, there was I brought up by my dear\r\nuncle and aunt, till my father bore me away to attend on the young lady\r\nhere.  It is eighteen months since they had any tidings from her who was\r\nas a daughter to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will see them myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kasimir; \xe2\x80\x9cI know the name.  Carved not\r\nMaster Gottfried the stall-work at Augsburg?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed!  In chestnut leaves!  And the Misereres all with fairy\r\ntales!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Christina.  \xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir, thanks indeed!  Bear to the dear,\r\ndear uncle and aunt their child\xe2\x80\x99s duteous greetings, and tell them she\r\nloves them with all her heart, and prays them to forgive her, and to pray\r\nfor her and her little ones!  And,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cmy uncle may not have\r\nlearnt how his brother, my father, died by his lord\xe2\x80\x99s side.  Oh! pray\r\nhim, if ever he loved his little Christina, to have masses sung for my\r\nfather and my own dear lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she promised, Ursel came to make the babes ready for their baptism,\r\nand Sir Kasimir moved away towards the window.  Ursel was looking uneasy\r\nand dismayed, and, as she bent over her mistress, she whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cLady,\r\nthe Schneiderlein sends you word that M\xc3\xa4tz has called him to help in\r\nremoving the props of the door you wot of when _he_ yonder steps across\r\nit.  He would know if it be your will?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe oubliette!\xe2\x80\x9d  This was Frau Kunigunde\xe2\x80\x99s usage of the relative who was\r\ndoing his best for the welfare of her grandsons!  Christina\xe2\x80\x99s whole\r\ncountenance looked so frozen with horror, that Ursel felt as if she had\r\nkilled her on the spot; but the next moment a flash of relief came over\r\nthe pale features, and the trembling lip commanded itself to say, \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nbest thanks to good Heinz.  Say to him that I forbid it.  If he loves the\r\nlife of his master\xe2\x80\x99s children, he will abstain!  Tell him so.  My\r\nblessings on him if this knight leave the castle safe, Ursel.\xe2\x80\x9d And her\r\nterrified earnest eyes impelled Ursel to hasten to do her bidding; but\r\nwhether it had been executed, there was no knowing, for almost\r\nimmediately the Freiherrinn and Father Norbert entered, and Ursel\r\nreturned with them.  Nay, the message given, who could tell if Heinz\r\nwould be able to act upon it?  In the ordinary condition of the castle,\r\nhe was indeed its most efficient inmate; M\xc3\xa4tz did not approach him in\r\nstrength, Hans was a cripple, Hatto would be on the right side; but Jobst\r\nthe Kohler, and the other serfs who had been called in for the defence,\r\nwere more likely to hold with the elder than the younger lady.  And Frau\r\nKunigunde herself, knowing well that the five-and-twenty men outside\r\nwould be incompetent to avenge their master, confident in her\r\nnarrow-minded, ignorant pride that no one could take Schloss Adlerstein,\r\nand incapable of understanding the changes in society that were rendering\r\nher isolated condition untenable, was certain to scout any representation\r\nof the dire consequences that the crime would entail.  Kasimir had no\r\nnear kindred, and private revenge was the only justice the Baroness\r\nbelieved in; she only saw in her crime the satisfaction of an old feud,\r\nand the union of the Wildschloss property with the parent stem.\r\n\r\nSeldom could such a christening have taken place as that of which\r\nChristina\xe2\x80\x99s bed-room was the scene\xe2\x80\x94the mother scarcely able even to think\r\nof the holy sacrament for the horror of knowing that the one sponsor was\r\nalready exulting in the speedy destruction of the other; and, poor little\r\nfeeble thing, rallying the last remnants of her severely-tried powers to\r\nprevent the crime at the most terrible of risks.\r\n\r\nThe elder babe received from his grandmother the hereditary name of\r\nEberhard, but Sir Kasimir looked at the mother inquiringly, ere he gave\r\nthe other to the priest.  Christina had well-nigh said, \xe2\x80\x9cOubliette,\xe2\x80\x9d but,\r\nrecalling herself in time, she feebly uttered the name she had longed\r\nafter from the moment she had known that two sons had been her Easter\r\ngift, \xe2\x80\x9cGottfried,\xe2\x80\x9d after her beloved uncle.  But Kunigunde caught the\r\nsound, and exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cNo son of Adlerstein shall bear abase craftsman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname.  Call him R\xc3\xa4cher (the avenger);\xe2\x80\x9d and in the word there already rang\r\na note of victory and revenge that made Christina\xe2\x80\x99s blood run cold.  Sir\r\nKasimir marked her trouble.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe lady mother loves not the sound,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, kindly.  \xe2\x80\x9cLady, have you any other wish?  Then will I call him\r\nFriedmund.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristina had almost smiled.  To her the omen was of the best.  Baron\r\nFriedmund had been the last common ancestor of the two branches of the\r\nfamily, the patron saint was so called, his wake was her wedding-day, the\r\nsound of the word imported peace, and the good Barons Ebbo and Friedel\r\nhad ever been linked together lovingly by popular memory.  And so the\r\nsecond little Baron received the name of Friedmund, and then the knight\r\nof Wildschloss, perceiving, with consideration rare in a warrior, that\r\nthe mother looked worn out and feverish, at once prepared to kiss her\r\nhand and take leave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne more favour, Sir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, lifting up her head, while a\r\nburning spot rose on either cheek.  \xe2\x80\x9cI beg of you to take my two babes\r\ndown\xe2\x80\x94yes, both, both, in your own arms, and show them to your men, owning\r\nthem as your kinsmen and godsons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Kasimir looked exceedingly amazed, as if he thought the lady\xe2\x80\x99s senses\r\ntaking leave of her, and Dame Kunigunde broke out into declarations that\r\nit was absurd, and she did not know what she was talking of; but she\r\nrepeated almost with passion, \xe2\x80\x9cTake them, take them, you know not how\r\nmuch depends on it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ursel, with unusual readiness of wit, signed and\r\nwhispered that the young mother must be humoured, for fear of\r\nconsequences; till the knight, in a good-natured, confused way, submitted\r\nto receive the two little bundles in his arms, while he gave place to\r\nKunigunde, who hastily stepped before him in a manner that made Christina\r\ntrust that her precaution would be effectual.\r\n\r\nThe room was reeling round with her.  The agony of those few minutes was\r\nbeyond all things unspeakable.  What had seemed just before like a\r\ncertain way of saving the guest without real danger to her children, now\r\nappeared instead the most certain destruction to all, and herself the\r\nunnatural mother who had doomed her new-born babes for a stranger\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\nShe could not even pray; she would have shrieked to have them brought\r\nback, but her voice was dead within her, her tongue clave to the roof of\r\nher mouth, ringings in her ears hindered her even from listening to the\r\ndescending steps.  She lay as one dead, when ten minutes afterwards the\r\ncry of one of her babes struck on her ear, and the next moment Ursel\r\nstood beside her, laying them down close to her, and saying exultingly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSafe! safe out at the gate, and down the hillside, and my old lady ready\r\nto gnaw off her hands for spite!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\nTHE EAGLETS\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTINA\xe2\x80\x99S mental and bodily constitution had much similarity\xe2\x80\x94apparently\r\nmost delicate, tender, and timid, yet capable of a vigour, health, and\r\nendurance that withstood shocks that might have been fatal to many\r\napparently stronger persons.  The events of that frightful Easter Monday\r\nmorning did indeed almost kill her; but the effects, though severe, were\r\nnot lasting; and by the time the last of Ermentrude\xe2\x80\x99s snow-wreath had\r\nvanished, she was sunning her babes at the window, happier than she had\r\never thought to be\xe2\x80\x94above all, in the possession of both the children.  A\r\nnurse had been captured for the little Baron from the village on the\r\nhillside; but the woman had fretted, the child had pined, and had been\r\ngiven back to his mother to save his life; and ever since both had\r\nthriven perfectly under her sole care, so that there was very nearly joy\r\nin that room.\r\n\r\nOutside it, there was more bitterness than ever.  The grandmother had\r\nsoftened for a few moments at the birth of the children, with\r\nsatisfaction at obtaining twice as much as she had hoped; but the\r\nfrustration of her vengeance upon Kasimir of Adlerstein Wildschloss had\r\nrenewed all her hatred, and she had no scruple in abusing \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nburgher-woman\xe2\x80\x9d to the whole household for her artful desire to captivate\r\nanother nobleman.  She, no doubt, expected that degenerate fool of a\r\nWildschlosser to come wooing after her; \xe2\x80\x9cif he did he should meet his\r\ndeserts.\xe2\x80\x9d  It was the favourite reproach whenever she chose to vent her\r\nfury on the mute, blushing, weeping young widow, whose glance at her\r\nbabies was her only appeal against the cruel accusation.\r\n\r\nOn Midsummer eve, Heinz the Schneiderlein, who had all day been taking\r\ntoll from the various attendants at the Friedmund Wake, came up and\r\nknocked at the door.  He had a bundle over his shoulder and a bag in his\r\nhand, which last he offered to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe toll!  It is for the Lady Baroness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are my Lady Baroness.  I levy toll for this my young lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it to her, good Heinz, she must have the charge, and needless\r\nstrife I will not breed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe angry notes of Dame Kunigunde came up: \xe2\x80\x9cHow now, knave Schneiderlein!\r\nCome down with the toll instantly.  It shall not be tampered with!  Down,\r\nI say, thou thief of a tailor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo; prithee go, vex her not,\xe2\x80\x9d entreated Christina.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComing, lady!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Heinz, and, disregarding all further objurgations\r\nfrom beneath, he proceeded to deposit his bundle, and explain that it had\r\nbeen entrusted to him by a pedlar from Ulm, who would likewise take\r\ncharge of anything she might have to send in return, and he then ran down\r\njust in time to prevent a domiciliary visit from the old lady.\r\n\r\nFrom Ulm!  The very sound was joy; and Christina with trembling hands\r\nunfastened the cords and stitches that secured the canvas covering,\r\nwithin which lay folds on folds of linen, and in the midst a rich silver\r\ngoblet, long ago brought by her father from Italy, a few of her own\r\npossessions, and a letter from her uncle secured with black floss silk,\r\nwith a black seal.\r\n\r\nShe kissed it with transport, but the contents were somewhat chilling by\r\ntheir grave formality.  The opening address to the \xe2\x80\x9chonour-worthy Lady\r\nBaroness and love-worthy niece,\xe2\x80\x9d conveyed to her a doubt on good Master\r\nGottfried\xe2\x80\x99s part whether she were still truly worthy of love or honour.\r\nThe slaughter at Jacob M\xc3\xbcller\xe2\x80\x99s had been already known to him, and he\r\nexpressed himself as relieved, but greatly amazed, at the information he\r\nhad received from the Baron of Adlerstein Wildschloss, who had visited\r\nhim at Ulm, after having verified what had been alleged at Schloss\r\nAdlerstein by application to the friar at Offingen.\r\n\r\nFreiherr von Adlerstein Wildschloss had further requested him to make\r\nknown that, feud-briefs having regularly passed between Schlangenwald and\r\nAdlerstein, and the two Barons not having been within the peace of the\r\nempire, no justice could be exacted for their deaths; yet, in\r\nconsideration of the tender age of the present heirs, the question of\r\nforfeiture or submission should be waived till they could act for\r\nthemselves, and Schlangenwald should be withheld from injuring them so\r\nlong as no molestation was offered to travellers.  It was plain that Sir\r\nKasimir had well and generously done his best to protect the helpless\r\ntwins, and he sent respectful but cordial greetings to their mother.\r\nThese however were far less heeded by her than the coldness of her\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s letter.  She had drifted beyond the reckoning of her kindred, and\r\nthey were sending her her property and bridal linen, as if they had done\r\nwith her, and had lost their child in the robber-baron\xe2\x80\x99s wife.  Yet at\r\nthe end there was a touch of old times in offering a blessing, should she\r\nstill value it, and the hopes that heaven and the saints would comfort\r\nher; \xe2\x80\x9cfor surely, thou poor child, thou must have suffered much, and, if\r\nthou wiliest still to write to thy city kin, thine aunt would rejoice to\r\nhear that thou and thy babes were in good health.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPrecise grammarian and scribe as was Uncle Gottfried, the lapse from the\r\nformal _Sie_ to the familiar _Du_ went to his niece\xe2\x80\x99s heart.  Whenever\r\nher little ones left her any leisure, she spent this her first\r\nwedding-day in writing so earnest and loving a letter as, in spite of\r\nmedi\xc3\xa6val formality, must assure the good burgomaster that, except in\r\nhaving suffered much and loved much, his little Christina was not changed\r\nsince she had left him.\r\n\r\nNo answer could be looked for till another wake-day; but, when it came,\r\nit was full and loving, and therewith were sent a few more of her\r\nfavourite books, a girdle, and a richly-scented pair of gloves, together\r\nwith two ivory boxes of comfits, and two little purple silk, gold-edged,\r\nstraight, narrow garments and tight round brimless lace caps, for the two\r\nlittle Barons.  Nor did henceforth a wake-day pass by without bringing\r\nsome such token, not only delightful as gratifying Christina\xe2\x80\x99s affection\r\nby the kindness that suggested them, but supplying absolute wants in the\r\ndire stress of poverty at Schloss Adlerstein.\r\n\r\nChristina durst not tell her mother-in-law of the terms on which they\r\nwere unmolested, trusting to the scantiness of the retinue, and to her\r\nown influence with the Schneiderlein to hinder any serious violence.\r\nIndeed, while the Count of Schlangenwald was in the neighbourhood, his\r\nfollowers took care to secure all that could be captured at the\r\nDebateable Ford, and the broken forces of Adlerstein would have been\r\ninsane had they attempted to contend with such superior numbers.  That\r\nthe castle remained unattacked was attributed by the elder Baroness to\r\nits own merits; nor did Christina undeceive her.  They had no intercourse\r\nwith the outer world, except that once a pursuivant arrived with a formal\r\nintimation from their kinsman, the Baron of Adlerstein Wildschloss, of\r\nhis marriage with the noble Fr\xc3\xa4ulein, Countess Valeska von Trautbach, and\r\na present of a gay dagger for each of his godsons.  Frau Kunigunde\r\ntriumphed a good deal over the notion of Christina\xe2\x80\x99s supposed\r\ndisappointment; but the tidings were most welcome to the younger lady,\r\nwho trusted they would put an end to all future taunts about Wildschloss.\r\nAlas! the handle for abuse was too valuable to be relinquished.\r\n\r\nThe last silver cup the castle had possessed had to be given as a reward\r\nto the pursuivant, and mayhap Frau Kunigunde reckoned this as another\r\noffence of her daughter-in-law, since, had Sir Kasimir been safe in the\r\noubliette, the twins might have shared his broad lands on the Danube,\r\ninstead of contributing to the fees of his pursuivant.  The cup could\r\nindeed be ill spared.  The cattle and swine, the dues of the serfs, and\r\nthe yearly toll at the wake were the sole resources of the household; and\r\nthough there was no lack of meat, milk, and black bread, sufficient\r\ngarments could scarce be come by, with all the spinning of the household,\r\nwoven by the village webster, of whose time the baronial household, by\r\nprescriptive right, owned the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share.\r\n\r\nThese matters little troubled the two beings in whom Christina\xe2\x80\x99s heart\r\nwas wrapped up.  Though running about barefooted and bareheaded, they\r\nwere healthy, handsome, straight-limbed, noble-looking creatures, so\r\nexactly alike, and so inseparable, that no one except herself could tell\r\none from the other save by the medal of Our Lady worn by the elder, and\r\nthe little cross carved by the mother for the younger; indeed, at one\r\ntime, the urchins themselves would feel for cross or medal, ere naming\r\nthemselves \xe2\x80\x9cEbbo,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cFriedel.\xe2\x80\x9d  They were tall for their age, but with\r\nthe slender make of their foreign ancestry; and, though their fair rosy\r\ncomplexions were brightened by mountain mists and winds, their rapidly\r\ndarkening hair, and large liquid brown eyes, told of their Italian blood.\r\nTheir grandmother looked on their colouring as a taint, and Christina\r\nherself had hoped to see their father\xe2\x80\x99s simple, kindly blue eyes revive\r\nin his boys; but she could hardly have desired anything different from\r\nthe dancing, kindling, or earnest glances that used to flash from under\r\ntheir long black lashes when they were nestling in her lap, or playing by\r\nher knee, making music with their prattle, or listening to her answers\r\nwith faces alive with intelligence.  They scarcely left her time for\r\nsorrow or regret.\r\n\r\nThey were never quarrelsome.  Either from the influence of her\r\ngentleness, or from their absolute union, they could do and enjoy nothing\r\napart, and would as soon have thought of their right and left hands\r\nfalling out as of Ebbo and Friedel disputing.  Ebbo however was always\r\nthe right hand.  _The_ Freiherr, as he had been called from the first,\r\nhad, from the time he could sit at the table at all, been put into the\r\nbaronial chair with the eagle carved at the back; every member of the\r\nhousehold, from his grandmother downwards, placed him foremost, and\r\nFriedel followed their example, at the less loss to himself, as his hand\r\nwas always in Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s, and all their doings were in common.  Sometimes\r\nhowever the mother doubted whether there would have been this perfect\r\nabsence of all contest had the medal of the firstborn chanced to hang\r\nround Friedmund\xe2\x80\x99s neck instead of Eberhard\xe2\x80\x99s.  At first they were\r\nentirely left to her.  Their grandmother heeded them little as long as\r\nthey were healthy, and evidently regarded them more as heirs of\r\nAdlerstein than as grandchildren; but, as they grew older, she showed\r\nanxiety lest their mother should interfere with the fierce, lawless\r\nspirit proper to their line.\r\n\r\nOne winter day, when they were nearly six years old, Christina, spinning\r\nat her window, had been watching them snowballing in the castle court,\r\nsmiling and applauding every large handful held up to her, every laughing\r\ncombat, every well-aimed hit, as the hardy little fellows scattered the\r\nsnow in showers round them, raising their merry fur-capped faces to the\r\nbright eyes that \xe2\x80\x9crained influence and judged the prize.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy and by they stood still; Ebbo\xe2\x80\x94she knew him by the tossed head and\r\ncommanding air\xe2\x80\x94was proposing what Friedel seemed to disapprove; but,\r\nafter a short discussion, Ebbo flung away from him, and went towards a\r\nshed where was kept a wolf-cub, recently presented to the young Barons by\r\nold Ulrich\xe2\x80\x99s son.  The whelp was so young as to be quite harmless, but it\r\nwas far from amiable; Friedel never willingly approached it, and the\r\nsnarling and whining replies to all advances had begun to weary and\r\nirritate Ebbo.  He dragged it out by its chain, and, tethering it to a\r\npost, made it a mark for his snowballs, which, kneaded hard, and\r\ndelivered with hearty good-will by his sturdy arms, made the poor little\r\nbeast yelp with pain and terror, till the more tender-hearted Friedel\r\nthrew himself on his brother to withhold him, while M\xc3\xa4tz stood by\r\nlaughing and applauding the Baron.  Seeing Ebbo shake Friedel off with\r\nunusual petulance, and pitying the tormented animal, Christina flung a\r\ncloak round her head and hastened down stairs, entering the court just as\r\nthe terrified whelp had made a snap at the boy, which was returned by\r\nangry, vindictive pelting, not merely with snow, but with stones.\r\nFriedel sprang to her crying, and her call to Ebbo made him turn, though\r\nwith fury in his face, shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cHe would bite me! the evil beast!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome with me, Ebbo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe shall suffer for it, the spiteful, ungrateful brute!  Let me alone,\r\nmother!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ebbo, stamping on the snow, but still from habit yielding\r\nto her hand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat now?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the old Baroness, appearing on the scene.  \xe2\x80\x9cWho is\r\nthwarting the Baron?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe; she will not let me deal with yonder savage whelp,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe!  Take thy way, child,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady.  \xe2\x80\x9cVisit him well for his\r\nmalice.  None shall withstand thee here.  At thy peril!\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\r\nturning on Christina.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, art not content to have brought base\r\nmechanical blood into a noble house?  Wouldst make slaves and cowards of\r\nits sons?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would teach them true courage, not cruelty,\xe2\x80\x9d she tried to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat should such as thou know of courage?  Look here, girl: another word\r\nto daunt the spirit of my grandsons, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll have thee scourged down the\r\nmountain-side!  On!  At him, Ebbo!  That\xe2\x80\x99s my gallant young knight!  Out\r\nof the way, girl, with thy whining looks!  What, Friedel, be a man, and\r\naid thy brother!  Has she made thee a puling woman already?\xe2\x80\x9d  And\r\nKunigunde laid an ungentle grasp upon Friedmund, who was clinging to his\r\nmother, hiding his face in her gown.  He struggled against the clutch,\r\nand would not look up or be detached.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFie, poor little coward!\xe2\x80\x9d taunted the old lady; \xe2\x80\x9cnever heed him, Ebbo,\r\nmy brave Baron!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCut to the heart, Christina took refuge in her room, and gathered her\r\nFriedel to her bosom, as he sobbed out, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, mother, the poor little\r\nwolf!  Oh, mother, are you weeping too?  The grandmother should not so\r\nspeak to the sweetest, dearest motherling,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, throwing his arms\r\nround her neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, Friedel, that Ebbo should learn that it is brave to hurt the\r\nweak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not like Walther of V\xc3\xb6gelwiede,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, whose mind had been\r\nmuch impressed by the Minnesinger\xe2\x80\x99s bequest to the birds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor like any true Christian knight.  Alas, my poor boys, must you be\r\ntaught foul cruelty and I too weak and cowardly to save you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat never will be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, lifting his head from her shoulder.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark! what a howl was that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen not, dear child; it does but pain thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Ebbo is not shouting.  Oh, mother, he is vexed\xe2\x80\x94he is hurt!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nFriedel, springing from her lap; but, ere either could reach the window,\r\nEbbo had vanished from the scene.  They only saw the young wolf stretched\r\ndead on the snow, and the same moment in burst Ebbo, and flung himself on\r\nthe floor in a passion of weeping.  Stimulated by the applause of his\r\ngrandmother and of M\xc3\xa4tz, he had furiously pelted the poor animal with all\r\nmissiles that came to hand, till a blow, either from him or M\xc3\xa4tz, had\r\nproduced such a howl and struggle of agony, and then such terrible\r\nstillness, as had gone to the young Baron\xe2\x80\x99s very heart, a heart as soft\r\nas that of his father had been by nature.  Indeed, his sobs were so\r\npiteous that his mother was relieved to hear only, \xe2\x80\x9cThe wolf! the poor\r\nwolf!\xe2\x80\x9d and to find that he himself was unhurt; and she was scarcely\r\nsatisfied of this when Dame Kunigunde came up also alarmed, and thus\r\nturned his grief to wrath.  \xe2\x80\x9cAs if I would cry in that way for a bite!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said.  \xe2\x80\x9cGo, grandame; you made me do it, the poor beast!\xe2\x80\x9d with a fresh\r\nsob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUlrich shall get thee another cub, my child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; I never will have another cub!  Why did you let me kill it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor shame, Ebbo!  Weep for a spiteful brute!  That\xe2\x80\x99s no better than thy\r\nmother or Friedel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love my mother!  I love Friedel!  They would have withheld me.  Go,\r\ngo; I hate you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace, peace, Ebbo,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed his mother; \xe2\x80\x9cyou know not what you say.\r\nAsk your grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s pardon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace, thou fool!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed the old lady.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Baron speaks as he will\r\nin his own castle.  He is not to be checked here, and thwarted there, and\r\ntaught to mince his words like a cap-in-hand pedlar.  Pardon!  When did\r\nan Adlerstein seek pardon?  Come with me, my Baron; I have still some\r\nhoney-cakes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ebbo; \xe2\x80\x9choney-cakes will not cure the wolf whelp.  Go: I\r\nwant my mother and Friedel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlone with them his pride and passion were gone; but alas! what augury\r\nfor the future of her boys was left with the mother!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\nTHE EAGLE\xe2\x80\x99S PREY\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cIT fell about the Lammas tide,\r\n    When moor men win their hay,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nthat all the serfs of Adlerstein were collected to collect their lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhay to be stored for the winter\xe2\x80\x99s fodder of the goats, and of poor Sir\r\nEberhard\xe2\x80\x99s old white mare, the only steed as yet ridden by the young\r\nBarons.\r\n\r\nThe boys were fourteen years old.  So monotonous was their mother\xe2\x80\x99s life\r\nthat it was chiefly their growth that marked the length of her residence\r\nin the castle.  Otherwise there had been no change, except that the elder\r\nBaroness was more feeble in her limbs, and still more irritable and\r\nexcitable in temper.  There were no events, save a few hunting adventures\r\nof the boys, or the yearly correspondence with Ulm; and the same life\r\ncontinued, of shrinking in dread from the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s tyrannous dislike,\r\nand of the constant endeavour to infuse better principles into the boys,\r\nwithout the open opposition for which there was neither power nor\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nThe boys\xe2\x80\x99 love was entirely given to their mother.  Far from diminishing\r\nwith their dependence on her, it increased with the sense of protection;\r\nand, now that they were taller than herself, she seemed to be cherished\r\nby them more than ever.  Moreover, she was their oracle.  Quick-witted\r\nand active-minded, loving books the more because their grandmother\r\nthought signing a feud-letter the utmost literary effort becoming to a\r\nnoble, they never rested till they had acquired all that their mother\r\ncould teach them; or, rather, they then became more restless than ever.\r\nLong ago had her whole store of tales and ballads become so familiar, by\r\nrepetition, that the boys could correct her in the smallest variation;\r\nreading and writing were mastered as for pleasure; and the Nuremberg\r\nChronicle, with its wonderful woodcuts, excited such a passion of\r\ncuriosity that they must needs conquer its Latin and read it for\r\nthemselves.  This _World History_, with _Alexander and the Nine\r\nWorthies_, the cities and landscapes, and the oft-repeated portraits, was\r\nEberhard\xe2\x80\x99s study; but Friedmund continued\xe2\x80\x94constant to Walther of\r\nV\xc3\xb6gelweide.  Eberhard cared for no character in the Vulgate so much as\r\nfor Judas the Maccabee; but Friedmund\xe2\x80\x99s heart was all for King David; and\r\nto both lads, shut up from companionship as they were, every acquaintance\r\nin their books was a living being whose like they fancied might be met\r\nbeyond their mountain.  And, when they should go forth, like Dietrich of\r\nBerne, in search of adventures, doughty deeds were chiefly to fall to the\r\nlot of Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s lance; while Friedel was to be their Minnesinger; and\r\nindeed certain verses, that he had murmured in his brother\xe2\x80\x99s ear, had\r\nleft no doubt in Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s mind that the exploits would be worthily sung.\r\n\r\nThe soft dreamy eye was becoming Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s characteristic, as fire and\r\nkeenness distinguished his brother\xe2\x80\x99s glance.  When at rest, the twins\r\ncould be known apart by their expression, though in all other respects\r\nthey were as alike as ever; and let Ebbo look thoughtful or Friedel eager\r\nand they were again undistinguishable; and indeed they were constantly\r\nchanging looks.  Had not Friedel been beside him, Ebbo would have been\r\ndeemed a wondrous student for his years; had not Ebbo been the standard\r\nof comparison, Friedel would have been in high repute for spirit and\r\nenterprise and skill as a cragsman, with the crossbow, and in all feats\r\nof arms that the Schneiderlein could impart.  They shared all\r\noccupations; and it was by the merest shade that Ebbo excelled with the\r\nweapon, and Friedel with the book or tool.  For the artist nature was in\r\nthem, not intentionally excited by their mother, but far too strong to be\r\neasily discouraged.  They had long daily gazed at Ulm in the distance,\r\nhoping to behold the spire completed; and the illustrations in their\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s books excited a strong desire to imitate them.  The floor had\r\noften been covered with charcoal outlines even before Christina was\r\npersuaded to impart the rules she had learnt from her uncle; and her\r\ncarving-tools were soon seized upon.  At first they were used only upon\r\nknobs of sticks; but one day when the boys, roaming on the mountain, had\r\nlost their way, and coming to the convent had been there hospitably\r\nwelcomed by Father Norbert, they came home wild to make carvings like\r\nwhat they had seen in the chapel.  Jobst the Kohler was continually\r\nimportuned for soft wood; the fair was ransacked for knives; and even the\r\nold Baroness could not find great fault with the occupation, base and\r\nmechanical though it were, which disposed of the two restless spirits\r\nduring the many hours when winter storms confined them to the castle.\r\nRude as was their work, the constant observation and choice of subjects\r\nwere an unsuspected training and softening.  It was not in vain that they\r\nlived in the glorious mountain fastness, and saw the sun descend in his\r\nmajesty, dyeing the masses of rock with purple and crimson; not in vain\r\nthat they beheld peak and ravine clothed in purest snow, flushed with\r\nrosy light at morn and eve, or contrasted with the purple blue of the\r\nsky; or that they stood marvelling at ice caverns with gigantic crystal\r\npendants shining with the most magical pure depths of sapphire and\r\nemerald, \xe2\x80\x9cas if,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, \xe2\x80\x9cwinter kept in his service all the\r\njewel-forging dwarfs of the motherling\xe2\x80\x99s tales.\xe2\x80\x9d And, when the snow\r\nmelted and the buds returned, the ivy spray, the smiling saxifrage, the\r\npurple gentian bell, the feathery rowan leaf, the symmetrical lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmantle, were hailed and loved first as models, then for themselves.\r\n\r\nOne regret their mother had, almost amounting to shame.  Every virtuous\r\nperson believed in the efficacy of the rod, and, maugre her own docility,\r\nshe had been chastised with it almost as a religious duty; but her sons\r\nhad never felt the weight of a blow, except once when their grandmother\r\ncaught them carving a border of eagles and doves round the hall table,\r\nand then Ebbo had returned the blow with all his might.  As to herself,\r\nif she ever worked herself up to attempt chastisement, the Baroness was\r\nsure to fall upon her for insulting the noble birth of her sons, and thus\r\ngave them a triumph far worse for them than impunity.  In truth, the boys\r\nhad their own way, or rather the Baron had his way, and his way was Baron\r\nFriedmund\xe2\x80\x99s.  Poor, bare, and scanty as were all the surroundings of\r\ntheir life, everything was done to feed their arrogance, with only one\r\ninfluence to counteract their education in pride and violence\xe2\x80\x94a mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninfluence, indeed, but her authority was studiously taken from her, and\r\nher position set at naught, with no power save what she might derive from\r\ntheir love and involuntary honour, and the sight of the pain caused her\r\nby their wrong-doings.\r\n\r\nAnd so the summer\xe2\x80\x99s hay-harvest was come.  Peasants clambered into the\r\ngreen nooks between the rocks to cut down with hook or knife the flowery\r\ngrass, for there was no space for the sweep of a scythe.  The best crop\r\nwas on the bank of the Braunwasser, by the Debateable Ford, but this was\r\ncut and carried on the backs of the serfs, much earlier than the mountain\r\ngrass, and never without much vigilance against the Schlangenwaldern; but\r\nthis year the Count was absent at his Styrian castle, and little had been\r\nseen or heard of his people.\r\n\r\nThe full muster of serfs appeared, for Frau Kunigunde admitted of no\r\nexcuses, and the sole absentee was a widow who lived on the ledge of the\r\nmountain next above that on which the castle stood.  Her son reported her\r\nto be very ill, and with tears in his eyes entreated Baron Friedel to\r\nobtain leave for him to return to her, since she was quite alone in her\r\nsolitary hut, with no one even to give her a drink of water.  Friedel\r\nrushed with the entreaty to his grandmother, but she laughed it to scorn.\r\nLazy Koppel only wanted an excuse, or, if not, the woman was old and\r\nuseless, and men could not be spared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! good grandame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, \xe2\x80\x9chis father died with ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe more honour for him!  The more he is bound to work for us.  Off,\r\njunker, make no loiterers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrieved and discomfited, Friedel betook himself to his mother and\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFoolish lad not to have come to me!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young Baron.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is\r\nhe?  I\xe2\x80\x99ll send him at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Christina interposed an offer to go and take Koppel\xe2\x80\x99s place beside\r\nhis mother, and her skill was so much prized over all the mountain-side,\r\nthat the alternative was gratefully accepted, and she was escorted up the\r\nsteep path by her two boys to the hovel, where she spent the day in\r\nattendance on the sick woman.\r\n\r\nEvening came on, the patient was better, but Koppel did not return, nor\r\ndid the young Barons come to fetch their mother home.  The last sunbeams\r\nwere dying off the mountain-tops, and, beginning to suspect something\r\namiss, she at length set off, and half way down met Koppel, who replied\r\nto her question, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, then, the gracious lady has not heard of our luck.\r\nExcellent booty, and two prisoners!  The young Baron has been a hero\r\nindeed, and has won himself a knightly steed.\xe2\x80\x9d  And, on her further\r\ninterrogation, he added, that an unusually rich but small company had\r\nbeen reported by Jobst the Kohler to be on the way to the ford, where he\r\nhad skilfully prepared a stumbling-block.  The gracious Baroness had\r\ncaused Hatto to jodel all the hay-makers together, and they had fallen on\r\nthe travellers by the straight path down the crag.  \xe2\x80\x9cAch! did not the\r\nyoung Baron spring like a young gemsbock?  And in midstream down came\r\ntheir pack-horses and their wares!  Some of them took to flight, but,\r\npfui, there were enough for my young lord to show his mettle upon.  Such\r\na prize the saints have not sent since the old Baron\xe2\x80\x99s time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristina pursued her walk in dismay at this new beginning of freebooting\r\nin its worst form, overthrowing all her hopes.  The best thing that could\r\nhappen would be the immediate interference of the Swabian League, while\r\nher sons were too young to be personally held guilty.  Yet this might\r\ninvolve ruin and confiscation; and, apart from all consequences, she\r\nbitterly grieved that the stain of robbery should have fallen on her\r\nhitherto innocent sons.\r\n\r\nEvery peasant she met greeted her with praises of their young lord, and,\r\nwhen she mounted the hall-steps, she found the floor strewn with bales of\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ebbo, flying up to her, \xe2\x80\x9chave you heard?  I have a horse!\r\na spirited bay, a knightly charger, and Friedel is to ride him by turns\r\nwith me.  Where is Friedel?  And, mother, Heinz said I struck as good a\r\nstroke as any of them, and I have a sword for Friedel now.  Why does he\r\nnot come?  And, motherling, this is for you, a gown of velvet, a real\r\nblack velvet, that will make you fairer than our Lady at the Convent.\r\nCome to the window and see it, mother dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy was so joyously excited that she could hardly withstand his\r\ndelight, but she did not move.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you like the velvet?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe always said that, the\r\nfirst prize we won, the motherling should wear velvet.  Do but look at\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoe is me, my Ebbo!\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed, bending to kiss his brow.\r\n\r\nHe understood her at once, coloured, and spoke hastily and in defiance.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was in the river, mother, the horses fell; it is our right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFairly, Ebbo?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, mother, if Jobst _did_ hide a branch in midstream, it was no doing\r\nof mine; and the horses fell.  The Schlangenwaldern don\xe2\x80\x99t even wait to\r\nlet them fall.  We cannot live, if we are to be so nice and dainty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! my son, I thought not to hear you call mercy and honesty mere\r\nniceness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I hear?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Frau Kunigunde, entering from the storeroom,\r\nwhere she had been disposing of some spices, a much esteemed commodity.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you chiding and daunting this boy, as you have done with the other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother may speak to me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ebbo, hotly, turning round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd quench thy spirit with whining fooleries!  Take the Baron\xe2\x80\x99s bounty,\r\nwoman, and vex him not after his first knightly exploit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven knows, and Ebbo knows,\xe2\x80\x9d said the trembling Christina, \xe2\x80\x9cthat, were\r\nit a knightly exploit, I were the first to exult.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou! thou craftsman\xe2\x80\x99s girl! dost presume to call in question the\r\nknightly deeds of a noble house!  There!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the furious Baroness,\r\nstriking her face.  \xe2\x80\x9cNow! dare to be insolent again.\xe2\x80\x9d  Her hand was\r\nuplifted for another blow, when it was grasped by Eberhard, and, the next\r\nmoment, he likewise held the other hand, with youthful strength far\r\nexceeding hers.  She had often struck his mother before, but not in his\r\npresence, and the greatness of the shock seemed to make him cool and\r\nabsolutely dignified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe still, grandame,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo, mother, I am not hurting her,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nindeed the surprise seemed to have taken away her rage and volubility,\r\nand unresistingly she allowed him to seat her in a chair.  Still holding\r\nher arm, he made his clear boyish voice resound through the hall, saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRetainers all, know that, as I am your lord and master, so is my\r\nhonoured mother lady of the castle, and she is never to be gainsay\xe2\x80\x99ed,\r\nlet her say or do what she will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, Herr Freiherr,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heinz.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Frau Christina is our\r\ngracious and beloved dame.  Long live the Freiherrinn Christina!\xe2\x80\x9d And the\r\nvoices of almost all the serfs present mingled in the cry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd hear you all,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Eberhard, \xe2\x80\x9cshe shall rule all, and never be\r\ntrampled on more.  Grandame, you understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman seemed confounded, and cowered in her chair without\r\nspeaking.  Christina, almost dismayed by this silence, would have\r\nsuggested to Ebbo to say something kind or consoling; but at that moment\r\nshe was struck with alarm by his renewed inquiry for his brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriedel!  Was not he with thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I never saw him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEbbo flew up the stairs, and shouted for his brother; then, coming down,\r\ngave orders for the men to go out on the mountain-side, and search and\r\njodel.  He was hurrying with them, but his mother caught his arm.  \xe2\x80\x9cO\r\nEbbo, how can I let you go?  It is dark, and the crags are so perilous!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, I cannot stay!\xe2\x80\x9d and the boy flung his arms round her neck, and\r\nwhispered in her ear, \xe2\x80\x9cFriedel said it would be a treacherous attack, and\r\nI called him a craven.  Oh, mother, we never parted thus before!  He went\r\nup the hillside.  Oh, where is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInfected by the boy\xe2\x80\x99s despairing voice, yet relieved that Friedel at\r\nleast had withstood the temptation, Christina still held Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and\r\ndescended the steps with him.  The clear blue sky was fast showing the\r\nstars, and into the evening stillness echoed the loud wide jodeln, cast\r\nback from the other side of the ravine.  Ebbo tried to raise his voice,\r\nbut broke down in the shout, and, choked with agitation, said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me\r\ngo, mother.  None know his haunts as I do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, only grasping him tighter.\r\n\r\nThinner, shriller, clearer came a far-away cry from the heights, and Ebbo\r\nthrilled from head to foot, then sent up another pealing mountain shout,\r\nresponded to by a jodel so pitched as to be plainly not an echo.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTowards the Red Eyrie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hans.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will have been to the Ptarmigan\xe2\x80\x99s Pool,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, sending up his\r\nvoice again, in hopes that the answer would sound less distant; but,\r\ninstead of this, its intonations conveyed, to these adepts in mountain\r\nlanguage, that Friedel stood in need of help.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDepend upon it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the startled Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he has got up amongst\r\nthose rocks where the dead chamois rolled down last summer;\xe2\x80\x9d then, as\r\nChristina uttered a faint cry of terror, Heinz added, \xe2\x80\x9cFear not, lady,\r\nthose are not the jodeln of one who has met with a hurt.  Baron Friedel\r\nhas the sense to be patient rather than risk his bones if he cannot move\r\nsafely in the dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp after him!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, emitting a variety of shouts intimating speedy\r\naid, and receiving a halloo in reply that reassured even his mother.\r\nEquipped with a rope and sundry torches of pinewood, Heinz and two of the\r\nserfs were speedily ready, and Christina implored her son to let her come\r\nso far as where she should not impede the others.  He gave her his arm,\r\nand Heinz held his torch so as to guide her up a winding path, not in\r\nitself very steep, but which she could never have climbed had daylight\r\nshown her what it overhung.  Guided by the constant exchange of jodeln,\r\nthey reached a height where the wind blew cold and wild, and Ebbo pointed\r\nto an intensely black shadow overhung by a peak rising like the gable of\r\na house into the sky.  \xe2\x80\x9cYonder lies the tarn,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t stir.\r\nThis way lies the cliff.  Fried-mund!\xe2\x80\x9d exchanging the jodel for the name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere!\xe2\x80\x94this way!  Under the Red Eyrie,\xe2\x80\x9d called back the wanderer; and\r\nsteering their course round the rocks above the pool, the rescuers made\r\ntheir way towards the base of the peak, which was in fact the summit of\r\nthe mountain, the top of the Eagle\xe2\x80\x99s Ladder, the highest step of which\r\nthey had attained.  The peak towered over them, and beneath, the castle\r\nlights seemed as if it would be easy to let a stone fall straight down on\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFriedel\xe2\x80\x99s cry seemed to come from under their feet.  \xe2\x80\x9cI am here!  I am\r\nsafe; only it grew so dark that I durst not climb up or down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Schneiderlein explained that he would lower down a rope, which, when\r\nfastened round Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s waist, would enable him to climb safely up; and,\r\nafter a breathless space, the torchlight shone upon the longed-for face,\r\nand Friedel springing on the path, cried, \xe2\x80\x9cThe mother!\xe2\x80\x94and here!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Friedel, where have you been?  What is this in your arms?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe showed them the innocent face of a little white kid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhence is it, Friedel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the peak, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI was lying on my back by the tarn, when\r\nmy lady eagle came sailing overhead, so low that I could see this poor\r\nlittle thing, and hear it bleat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hast been to the Eyrie\xe2\x80\x94the inaccessible Eyrie!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ebbo, in\r\namazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake.  It is not hard after the first\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nonly waited to watch the old birds out again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRobbed the eagles!  And the young ones?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedmund, as if half ashamed, \xe2\x80\x9cthey were twin eaglets, and\r\ntheir mother had left them, and I felt as though I could not harm them;\r\nso I only bore off their provisions, and stuck some feathers in my cap.\r\nBut by that time the sun was down, and soon I could not see my footing;\r\nand, when I found that I had missed the path, I thought I had best nestle\r\nin the nook where I was, and wait for day.  I grieved for my mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfear; but oh, to see her here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Friedel! didst do it to prove my words false?\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Ebbo,\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat words?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou knowest.  Make me not speak them again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, those!\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, only now recalling them.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo, verily; they\r\nwere but a moment\xe2\x80\x99s anger.  I wanted to save the kid.  I think it is old\r\nmother Rika\xe2\x80\x99s white kid.  But oh, motherling!  I grieve to have thus\r\nfrightened you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot a single word passed between them upon Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s exploits.  Whether\r\nFriedel had seen all from the heights, or whether he intuitively\r\nperceived that his brother preferred silence, he held his peace, and both\r\nwere solely occupied in assisting their mother down the pass, the\r\ndifficulties of which were far more felt now than in the excitement of\r\nthe ascent; only when they were near home, and the boys were walking in\r\nthe darkness with arms round one another\xe2\x80\x99s necks, Christina heard Friedel\r\nsay low and rather sadly, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I shall be a priest, Ebbo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Ebbo only answered, \xe2\x80\x9cPfui!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristina understood that Friedel meant that robbery must be a severance\r\nbetween the brothers.  Alas! had the moment come when their paths must\r\ndiverge?  Could Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s step not be redeemed?\r\n\r\nUrsel reported that Dame Kunigunde had scarcely spoken again, but had\r\nretired, like one stunned, into her bed.  Friedel was half asleep after\r\nthe exertions of the day; but Ebbo did not speak, and both soon betook\r\nthemselves to their little turret chamber within their mother\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nChristina prayed long that night, her heart full of dread of the\r\nconsequence of this transgression.  Rumours of freebooting castles\r\ndestroyed by the Swabian League had reached her every wake day, and, if\r\nthis outrage were once known, the sufferance that left Adlerstein\r\nunmolested must be over.  There was hope indeed in the weakness and\r\nuncertainty of the Government; but present safety would in reality be the\r\nruin of Ebbo, since he would be encouraged to persist in the career of\r\nviolence now unhappily begun.  She knew not what to ask, save that her\r\nsons might be shielded from evil, and might fulfil that promise of her\r\ndream, the star in heaven, the light on earth.  And for the present!\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ngood God guide her and her sons through the difficult morrow, and turn\r\nthe heart of the unhappy old woman below!\r\n\r\nWhen, exhausted with weeping and watching, she rose from her knees, she\r\nstole softly into her sons\xe2\x80\x99 turret for a last look at them.  Generally\r\nthey were so much alike in their sleep that even she was at fault between\r\nthem; but that night there was no doubt.  Friedel, pale after the day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhunger and fatigue, slept with relaxed features in the most complete\r\ncalm; but though Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were closed, there was no repose in his\r\nface\xe2\x80\x94his hair was tossed, his colour flushed, his brow contracted, the\r\narm flung across his brother had none of the ease of sleep.  She doubted\r\nwhether he were not awake; but, knowing that he would not brook any\r\nendeavour to force confidence he did not offer, she merely hung over them\r\nboth, murmured a prayer and blessing, and left them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\nTHE CHOICE IN LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFRIEDEL, wake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it day?\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, slowly wakening, and crossing himself as he\r\nopened his eyes.  \xe2\x80\x9cSurely the sun is not up\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must be before the sun!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, who was on his feet, beginning to\r\ndress himself.  \xe2\x80\x9cHush, and come!  Do not wake the mother.  It must be ere\r\nshe or aught else be astir!  Thy prayers\xe2\x80\x94I tell thee this is a work as\r\ngood as prayer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHalf awake, and entirely bewildered, Friedel dipped his finger in the\r\npearl mussel shell of holy water over their bed, and crossed his own brow\r\nand his brother\xe2\x80\x99s; then, carrying their shoes, they crossed their\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s chamber, and crept down stairs.  Ebbo muttered to his brother,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand thou still there, and pray the saints to keep her asleep;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthen, with bare feet, moved noiselessly behind the wooden partition that\r\nshut off his grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s box-bedstead from the rest of the hall.  She\r\nlay asleep with open mouth, snoring loudly, and on her pillow lay the\r\nbunch of castle keys, that was always carried to her at night.  It was a\r\nmoment of peril when Ebbo touched it; but he had nerved himself to be\r\nboth steady and dexterous, and he secured it without a jingle, and then,\r\nwithout entering the hall, descended into a passage lit by a rough\r\nopening cut in the rock.  Friedel, who began to comprehend, followed him\r\nclose and joyfully, and at the first door he fitted in, and with some\r\ndifficulty turned, a key, and pushed open the door of a vault, where\r\nmorning light, streaming through the grated window, showed two captives,\r\nwho had started to their feet, and now stood regarding the pair in the\r\ndoorway as if they thought their dreams were multiplying the young Baron\r\nwho had led the attack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Signori_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d began the principal of the two; but Ebbo spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, you have been brought here by a mistake in the absence of my\r\nmother, the lady of the castle.  If you will follow me, I will restore\r\nall that is within my reach, and put you on your way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe merchant\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of German was small, but the purport of the\r\nwords was plain, and he gladly left the damp, chilly vault.  Ebbo pointed\r\nto the bales that strewed the hall.  \xe2\x80\x9cTake all that can be carried,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.  \xe2\x80\x9cHere is your sword, and your purse,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, for these had been\r\ngiven to him in the moment of victory.  \xe2\x80\x9cI will bring out your horse and\r\nlead you to the pass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive him food,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Friedel; but the merchant was too anxious to\r\nhave any appetite.  Only he faltered in broken German a proposal to pay\r\nhis respects to the Signora Castellana, to whom he owed so much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!  _Dormit in lecto_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, with a sudden inspiration caught\r\nfrom the Latinized sound of some of the Italian words, but colouring\r\ndesperately as he spoke.\r\n\r\nThe Latin proved most serviceable, and the merchant understood that his\r\nproperty was restored, and made all speed to gather it together, and\r\ntransport it to the stable.  One or two of his beasts of burden had been\r\nlost in the fray, and there were more packages than could well be carried\r\nby the merchant, his servant, and his horse.  Ebbo gave the aid of the\r\nold white mare\xe2\x80\x94now very white indeed\xe2\x80\x94and in truth the boys pitied the\r\nmerchant\xe2\x80\x99s fine young bay for being put to base trading uses, and were\r\nrather shocked to hear that it had been taken in payment for a knight\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbranched velvet gown, and would be sold again at Ulm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a poor coxcomb of a knight!\xe2\x80\x9d said they to one another, as they\r\npatted the creature\xe2\x80\x99s neck with such fervent admiration that the merchant\r\nlonged to present it to them, when he saw that the old white mare was the\r\nsole steed they possessed, and watched their tender guidance both of her\r\nand of the bay up the rocky path so familiar to them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut ah, _signorini miei_, I am an _infelice infelicissimo_, ever\r\npersecuted by _le Fate_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy whom?  A count like Schlangenwald?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ebbo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Das Schicksal_,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Friedel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree long miserable years did I spend as a captive among the Moors,\r\nhaving lost all, my ships and all I had, and being forced to row their\r\ngalleys, _gli scomunicati_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGalleys!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ebbo; \xe2\x80\x9cthere are some pictured in our _World History\r\nbefore Carthage_.  Would that I could see one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _signorino_ would soon have seen his fill, were he between the\r\ndecks, chained to the bench for weeks together, without ceasing to row\r\nfor twenty-four hours together, with a renegade standing over to lash us,\r\nor to put a morsel into our mouths if we were fainting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dogs!  Do they thus use Christian men?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Friedel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_S\xc3\xac_, _s\xc3\xac\xe2\x80\x94ja wohl_.  There were a good fourscore of us, and among them a\r\nTedesco, a good man and true, from whom I learnt _la lingua loro_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur tongue!\xe2\x80\x94from whom?\xe2\x80\x9d asked one twin of the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Tedesco, a fellow-countryman of _sue eccellenze_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Deutscher_!\xe2\x80\x9d cried both boys, turning in horror, \xe2\x80\x9cour Germans so\r\ntreated by the pagan villains?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea, truly, _signorini miei_.  This fellow-captive of mine was a\r\n_cavaliere_ in his own land, but he had been betrayed and sold by his\r\nenemies, and he mourned piteously for _la sposa sua_\xe2\x80\x94his bride, as they\r\nsay here.  A goodly man and a tall, piteously cramped in the narrow deck,\r\nI grieved to leave him there when the good _confraternit\xc3\xa0_ at Genoa paid\r\nmy ransom.  Having learnt to speak _il Tedesco_, and being no longer able\r\nto fit out a vessel, I made my venture beyond the Alps; but, alas! till\r\nthis moment fortune has still been adverse.  My mules died of the toil of\r\ncrossing the mountains; and, when with reduced baggage I came to the\r\nriver beneath there\xe2\x80\x94when my horses fell and my servants fled, and the\r\npeasants came down with their hayforks\xe2\x80\x94I thought myself in hands no\r\nbetter than those of the Moors themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was wrongly done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, in an honest, open tone, though\r\nblushing.  \xe2\x80\x9cI have indeed a right to what may be stranded on the bank,\r\nbut never more shall foul means be employed for the overthrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boys had by this time led the traveller through the Gemsbock\xe2\x80\x99s Pass,\r\nwithin sight of the convent.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9cwill they give you\r\nharbourage, food, a guide, and a beast to carry the rest of your goods.\r\nWe are now upon convent land, and none will dare to touch your bales; so\r\nI will unload old Schimmel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, _signorino_, if I might offer any token of gratitude\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, with boyish lordliness, \xe2\x80\x9cmake me not a spoiler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the _signorini_ should ever come to Genoa,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the trader,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand would honour Gian Battista dei Battiste with a call, his whole house\r\nwould be at their feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks; I would that we could see strange lands!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut come,\r\nFriedel, the sun is high, and I locked them all into the castle to make\r\nmatters safe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay the liberated captive know the name of his deliverers, that he may\r\ncommend it to the saints?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the merchant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Eberhard, Freiherr von Adlerstein, and this is Freiherr Friedmund,\r\nmy brother.  Farewell, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the merchant, as he watched the two boys turn down\r\nthe pass, \xe2\x80\x9cstrange how like one barbarous name is to another.  Eberardo!\r\nThat was what we called _il Tedesco_, and, when he once told me his\r\nfamily name, it ended in _stino_; but all these foreign names sound\r\nalike.  Let us speed on, lest these accursed peasants should wake, and be\r\nbeyond the control of the _signorino_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Ebbo, as soon as he had hurried out of reach of the\r\ntemptation, \xe2\x80\x9csmall use in being a baron if one is to be no better\r\nmounted!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art glad to have let that fair creature go free, though,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nFriedel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, my mother\xe2\x80\x99s eyes would let me have no rest in keeping him.\r\nOtherwise\xe2\x80\x94Talk not to me of gladness, Friedel!  Thou shouldst know\r\nbetter.  How is one to be a knight with nothing to ride but a beast old\r\nenough to be his grandmother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnighthood of the heart may be content to go afoot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel.  \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nEbbo, what a brother thou art!  How happy the mother will be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPfui, Friedel; what boots heart without spur?  I am sick of being mewed\r\nup here within these walls of rock!  No sport, not even with falling on a\r\ntraveller.  I am worse off than ever were my forefathers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how is it?  I cannot understand,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Friedel.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has changed\r\nthy mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou, and the mother, and, more than all, the grandame.  Listen,\r\nFriedel: when thou camest up, in all the whirl of eagerness and glad\r\npreparation, with thy grave face and murmur that Jobst had put forked\r\nstakes in the stream, it was past man\xe2\x80\x99s endurance to be baulked of the\r\nfray.  Thou hast forgotten what I said to thee then, good Friedel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong since.  No doubt I thrust in vexatiously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo; \xe2\x80\x9cand I saw thou hadst reason, for the stakes were\r\nmost maliciously planted, with long branches hid by the current; but the\r\nfellows were showing fight, and I could not stay to think then, or I\r\nshould have seemed to fear them!  I can tell you we made them run!  But I\r\nnever meant the grandmother to put yon poor fellow in the dungeon, and\r\nuse him worse than a dog.  I wot that he was my captive, and none of\r\nhers.  And then came the mother; and oh, Friedel, she looked as if I were\r\nslaying her when she saw the spoil; and, ere I had made her see right and\r\nreason, the old lady came swooping down in full malice and spite, and\r\nactually came to blows.  She struck the motherling\xe2\x80\x94struck her on the\r\nface, Friedel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear me it has so been before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever will it be so again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, standing still.  \xe2\x80\x9cI took the old\r\nhag by the hands, and told her she had ruled long enough!  My father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife is as good a lady of the castle as my grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s, and I myself am\r\nlord thereof; and, since my Lady Kunigunde chooses to cross me and beat\r\nmy mother about this capture, why she has seen the last of it, and may\r\nlearn who is master, and who is mistress!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Ebbo!  I would I had seen it!  But was not she outrageous?  Was not\r\nthe mother shrinking and ready to give back all her claims at once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she would have been, but just then she found thou wast not with\r\nme, and I found thou wast not with her, and we thought of nought else.\r\nBut thou must stand by me, Friedel, and help to keep the grandmother in\r\nher place, and the mother in hers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the mother _will_ be kept,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel.  \xe2\x80\x9cI fear me she will only\r\nplead to be left to the grandame\xe2\x80\x99s treatment, as before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, Friedel!  I will never see her so used again.  I released this\r\nman solely to show that she is to rule here.\xe2\x80\x94Yes, I know all about\r\nfreebooting being a deadly sin, and moreover that it will bring the\r\nLeague about our ears; and it was a cowardly trick of Jobst to put those\r\nbranches in the stream.  Did I not go over it last night till my brain\r\nwas dizzy?  But still, it is but living and dying like our fathers, and I\r\nhate tameness or dullness, and it is like a fool to go back from what one\r\nhas once begun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; it is like a brave man, when one has begun wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut then I thought of the grandame triumphing over the gentle mother\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nI know the mother wept over her beads half the night.  She _shall_ find\r\nshe has had her own way for once this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFriedel was silent for a few moments, then said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me tell thee what I\r\nsaw yesterday, Ebbo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the other brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI liked not to vex my mother by my tidings, so I climbed up to the tarn.\r\nThere is something always healing in that spot, is it not so, Ebbo?  When\r\nthe grandmother has been raving\xe2\x80\x9d (hitherto Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s worst grievance) \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nis like getting up nearer the quiet sky in the stillness there, when the\r\nsky seems to have come down into the deep blue water, and all is so\r\nstill, so wondrous still and calm.  I wonder if, when we see the great\r\nDome Kirk itself, it will give one\xe2\x80\x99s spirit wings, as does the gazing up\r\nfrom the Ptarmigan\xe2\x80\x99s Pool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou minnesinger, was it the blue sky thou hadst to tell me of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, brother, it was ere I reached it that I saw this sight.  I had\r\nscaled the peak where grows the stunted rowan, and I sat down to look\r\ndown on the other side of the gorge.  It was clear where I sat, but the\r\nravine was filled with clouds, and upon them\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe shape of the blessed Friedmund, thy patron?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Our_ patron,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel; \xe2\x80\x9cI saw him, a giant form in gown and hood,\r\ntraced in grey shadow upon the dazzling white cloud; and oh, Ebbo! he was\r\nstruggling with a thinner, darker, wilder shape bearing a club.  He\r\nstrove to withhold it; his gestures threatened and warned!  I watched\r\nlike one spell-bound, for it was to me as the guardian spirit of our race\r\nstriving for thee with the enemy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did it end?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cloud darkened, and swallowed them; nor should I have known the\r\nissue, if suddenly, on the very cloud where the strife had been, there\r\nhad not beamed forth a rainbow\xe2\x80\x94not a common rainbow, Ebbo, but a perfect\r\nring, a soft-glancing, many-tinted crown of victory.  Then I knew the\r\nsaint had won, and that thou wouldst win.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI!  What, not thyself\xe2\x80\x94his own namesake?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought, Ebbo, if the fight went very hard\xe2\x80\x94nay, if for a time the\r\ngrandame led thee her way\xe2\x80\x94that belike I might serve thee best by giving\r\nup all, and praying for thee in the hermit\xe2\x80\x99s cave, or as a monk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou!\xe2\x80\x94thou, my other self!  Aid me by burrowing in a hole like a rat!\r\nWhat foolery wilt say next?  No, no, Friedel, strike by my side, and I\r\nwill strike with thee; pray by my side, and I will pray with thee; but if\r\nthou takest none of the strokes, then will I none of the prayers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEbbo, thou knowest not what thou sayest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one knows better!  See, Friedel, wouldst thou have me all that the\r\nold Adlersteinen were, and worse too? then wilt thou leave me and hide\r\nthine head in some priestly cowl.  Maybe thou thinkest to pray my soul\r\ninto safety at the last moment as a favour to thine own abundant\r\nsanctity; but I tell thee, Friedel, that\xe2\x80\x99s no manly way to salvation.  If\r\nthou follow\xe2\x80\x99st that track, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care to get past the border-line\r\nwithin which prayer can help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFriedel crossed himself, and uttered an imploring exclamation of horror\r\nat these wild words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo; \xe2\x80\x9cI said not I meant any such thing\xe2\x80\x94so long as thou\r\nwilt be with me.  My purpose is to be a good man and true, a guard to the\r\nweak, a defence against the Turk, a good lord to my vassals, and, if it\r\nmay not be otherwise, I will take my oath to the Kaiser, and keep it.  Is\r\nthat enough for thee, Friedel, or wouldst thou see me a monk at once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Ebbo, this is what we ever planned.  I only dreamed of the other\r\nwhen\xe2\x80\x94when thou didst seem to be on the other track.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what can I do more than turn back?  I\xe2\x80\x99ll get absolution on Sunday,\r\nand tell Father Norbert that I will do any penance he pleases; and warn\r\nJobst that, if he sets any more traps in the river, I will drown him\r\nthere next!  Only get this priestly fancy away, Friedel, once and for\r\never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, never could I think of what would sever us,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Friedel,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csave\xe2\x80\x94when\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he added, hesitating, unwilling to harp on the former\r\nstring.  Ebbo broke in imperiously,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriedmund von Adlerstein, give me thy solemn word that I never again\r\nhear of this freak of turning priest or hermit.  What! art slow to speak?\r\nThinkest me too bad for thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Ebbo.  Heaven knows thou art stronger, more resolute than I.  I am\r\nmore likely to be too bad for thee.  But so long as we can be true,\r\nfaithful God-fearing Junkern together, Heaven forbid that we should\r\npart!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is our bond!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo; \xe2\x80\x9cnought shall part us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNought but death,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedmund, solemnly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my part,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, with perfect seriousness, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not believe\r\nthat one of us can live or die without the other.  But, hark! there\xe2\x80\x99s an\r\noutcry at the castle!  They have found out that they are locked in!  Ha!\r\nho! hilloa, Hatto, how like you playing prisoner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEbbo would have amused himself with the dismay of his garrison a little\r\nlonger, had not Friedel reminded him that their mother might be suffering\r\nfor their delay, and this suggestion made him march in hastily.  He found\r\nher standing drooping under the pitiless storm which Frau Kunigunde was\r\npouring out at the highest pitch of her cracked, trembling voice, one\r\nhand uplifted and clenched, the other grasping the back of a chair, while\r\nher whole frame shook with rage too mighty for her strength.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrandame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, striding up to the scene of action, \xe2\x80\x9ccease.\r\nRemember my words yestereve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has stolen the keys!  She has tampered with the servants!  She has\r\nreleased the prisoner\xe2\x80\x94thy prisoner, Ebbo!  She has cheated us as she did\r\nwith Wildschloss!  False burgherinn!  I trow she wanted another suitor!\r\nBane\xe2\x80\x94pest of Adlerstein!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFriedmund threw a supporting arm round his mother, but Ebbo confronted\r\nthe old lady.  \xe2\x80\x9cGrandmother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI freed the captive.  I stole the\r\nkeys\xe2\x80\x94I and Friedel!  No one else knew my purpose.  He was my captive, and\r\nI released him because he was foully taken.  I have chosen my lot in\r\nlife,\xe2\x80\x9d he added; and, standing in the middle of the hall, he took off his\r\ncap, and spoke gravely:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI will not be a treacherous robber-outlaw, but,\r\nso help me God, a faithful, loyal, godly nobleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis mother and Friedel breathed an \xe2\x80\x9cAmen\xe2\x80\x9d with all their hearts; and he\r\ncontinued,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thou, grandame, peace!  Such reverence shalt thou have as befits my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s mother; but henceforth mine own lady-mother is the mistress of\r\nthis castle, and whoever speaks a rude word to her offends the Freiherr\r\nvon Adlerstein.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n   [Picture: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Henceforth mine own lady-mother is the mistress of this\r\n  castle, and whoever speaks a rude word to her offends the Freiherr von\r\n                          Adlerstein\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Page 126]\r\n\r\nThat last day\xe2\x80\x99s work had made a great step in Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s life, and there he\r\nstood, grave and firm, ready for the assault; for, in effect, he and all\r\nbesides expected that the old lady would fly at him or at his mother like\r\na wild cat, as she would assuredly have done in a like case a year\r\nearlier; but she took them all by surprise by collapsing into her chair\r\nand sobbing piteously.  Ebbo, much distressed, tried to make her\r\nunderstand that she was to have all care and honour; but she muttered\r\nsomething about ingratitude, and continued to exhaust herself with\r\nweeping, spurning away all who approached her; and thenceforth she lived\r\nin a gloomy, sullen acquiescence in her deposition.\r\n\r\nChristina inclined to the opinion that she must have had some slight\r\nstroke in the night, for she was never the same woman again; her vigour\r\nhad passed away, and she would sit spinning, or rocking herself in her\r\nchair, scarcely alive to what passed, or scolding and fretting like a\r\nshadow of her old violence.  Nothing pleased her but the attentions of\r\nher grandsons, and happily she soon ceased to know them apart, and gave\r\nEbbo credit for all that was done for her by Friedel, whose separate\r\nexistence she seemed to have forgotten.\r\n\r\nAs long as her old spirit remained she would not suffer the approach of\r\nher daughter-in-law, and Christina could only make suggestions for her\r\ncomfort to be acted on by Ursel; and though the reins of government fast\r\ndropped from the aged hands, they were but gradually and cautiously\r\nassumed by the younger Baroness.\r\n\r\nOnly Elsie remained of the rude, demoralized girls whom she had found in\r\nthe castle, and their successors, though dull and uncouth, were meek and\r\nmanageable; the men of the castle had all, except M\xc3\xa4tz, been always\r\ndevoted to the Frau Christina; and M\xc3\xa4tz, to her great relief, ran away so\r\nsoon as he found that decency and honesty were to be the rule.  Old\r\nHatto, humpbacked Hans, and Heinz the Schneiderlein, were the whole male\r\nestablishment, and had at least the merit of attachment to herself and\r\nher sons; and in time there was a shade of greater civilization about the\r\ncastle, though impeded both by dire poverty and the doggedness of the old\r\nretainers.  At least the court was cleared of the swine, and, within\r\ndoors, the table was spread with dainty linen out of the parcels from\r\nUlm, and the meals served with orderliness that annoyed the boys at\r\nfirst, but soon became a subject of pride and pleasure.\r\n\r\nFrau Kunigunde lingered long, with increasing infirmities.  After the\r\nwinter day, when, running down at a sudden noise, Friedel picked her up\r\nfrom the hearthstone, scorched, bruised, almost senseless, she accepted\r\nChristina\xe2\x80\x99s care with nothing worse than a snarl, and gradually seemed to\r\nforget the identity of her nurse with the interloping burgher girl.\r\nThanks or courtesy had been no part of her nature, least of all towards\r\nher own sex, and she did little but grumble, fret, and revile her\r\nattendant; but she soon depended so much on Christina\xe2\x80\x99s care, that it was\r\nhardly possible to leave her.  At her best and strongest, her talk was\r\nmaundering abuse of her son\xe2\x80\x99s low-born wife; but at times her wanderings\r\nshowed black gulfs of iniquity and coarseness of soul that would make the\r\ngentle listener tremble, and be thankful that her sons were out of\r\nhearing.  And thus did Christina von Adlerstein requite fifteen years of\r\npersecution.\r\n\r\nThe old lady\xe2\x80\x99s first failure had been in the summer of 1488; it was the\r\nAdvent season of 1489, when the snow was at the deepest, and the frost at\r\nthe hardest, that the two hardy mountaineer grandsons fetched over the\r\npass Father Norbert, and a still sturdier, stronger monk, to the dying\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we in time, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ebbo, from the door of the upper chamber,\r\nwhere the Adlersteins began and ended life, shaking the snow from his\r\nmufflings.  Ruddy with exertion in the sharp wind, what a contrast he was\r\nto all within the room!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that?\xe2\x80\x9d said a thin, feeble voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Ebbo.  It is the Baron,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina.  \xe2\x80\x9cCome in, Ebbo.  She is\r\nsomewhat revived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill she be able to speak to the priest?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ebbo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPriest!\xe2\x80\x9d feebly screamed the old woman.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo priest for me!  My lord\r\ndied unshriven, unassoilzied.  Where he is, there will I be.  Let a\r\npriest approach me at his peril!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStony insensibility ensued; nor did she speak again, though life lasted\r\nmany hours longer.  The priests did their office; for, impenitent as the\r\nlife and frantic as the words had been, the opinions of the time deemed\r\nthat their rites might yet give the departing soul a chance, though the\r\nbody was unconscious.\r\n\r\nWhen all was over, snow was again falling, shifting and drifting, so that\r\nit was impossible to leave the castle, and the two monks were kept there\r\nfor a full fortnight, during which Christmas solemnities were observed in\r\nthe chapel, for the first time since the days of Friedmund the Good.  The\r\ncorpse of Kunigunde, preserved\xe2\x80\x94we must say the word\xe2\x80\x94salted, was placed in\r\na coffin, and laid in that chapel to await the melting of the snows, when\r\nthe vault at the Hermitage could be opened.  And this could not be\r\neffected till Easter had nearly come round again, and it was within a\r\nweek of their sixteenth birthday that the two young Barons stood together\r\nat the coffin\xe2\x80\x99s head, serious indeed, but more with the thought of life\r\nthan of death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\nBACK TO THE DOVECOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR the first time in her residence at Adlerstein, now full half her\r\nlife, the Freiherrinn Christina ventured to send a messenger to Ulm,\r\nnamely, a lay brother of the convent of St. Ruprecht, who undertook to\r\nconvey to Master Gottfried Sorel her letter, informing him of the death\r\nof her mother-in-law, and requesting him to send the same tidings to the\r\nFreiherr von Adlerstein Wildschloss, the kinsman and godfather of her\r\nsons.\r\n\r\nShe was used to wait fifty-two weeks for answers to her letters, and was\r\namazed when, at the end of three, two stout serving-men were guided by\r\nJobst up the pass; but her heart warmed to their flat caps and round\r\njerkins, they looked so like home.  They bore a letter of invitation to\r\nher and her sons to come at once to her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s house.  The King of the\r\nRomans, and perhaps the Emperor, were to come to the city early in the\r\nsummer, and there could be no better opportunity of presenting the young\r\nBarons to their sovereign.  Sir Kasimir of Adlerstein Wildschloss would\r\nmeet them there for the purpose, and would obtain their admission to the\r\nLeague, in which all Swabian nobles had bound themselves to put down\r\nrobbery and oppression, and outside which there was nothing but outlawry\r\nand danger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo must it be?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, between his teeth, as he leant moodily\r\nagainst the wall, while his mother was gone to attend to the fare to be\r\nset before the messengers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! art not glad to take wing at last?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Friedel, cut short\r\nin an exclamation of delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake wing, forsooth!  To be guest of a greasy burgher, and call cousin\r\nwith him!  Fear not, Friedel; I\xe2\x80\x99ll not vex the motherling.  Heaven knows\r\nshe has had pain, grief, and subjection enough in her lifetime, and I\r\nwould not hinder her visit to her home; but I would she could go alone,\r\nnor make us show our poverty to the swollen city folk, and listen to\r\ntheir endearments.  I charge thee, Friedel, do as I do; be not too\r\nfamiliar with them.  Could we but sprain an ankle over the crag\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, she would stay to nurse us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, laughing; \xe2\x80\x9cbesides, thou\r\nart needed for the matter of homage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, Friedel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, sinking his voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall not lightly yield\r\nmy freedom to king or Kaiser.  Maybe, there is no help for it; but it\r\nirks me to think that I should be the last Lord of Adlerstein to whom the\r\ntitle of Freiherr is not a mockery.  Why dost bend thy brow, brother?\r\nWhat art thinking of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a saying in my mother\xe2\x80\x99s book, that well-ordered service is true\r\nfreedom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd methinks there will be freedom in rushing\r\nat last into the great far-off!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the boy\xe2\x80\x99s eye expanded and glistened\r\nwith eagerness.  \xe2\x80\x9cHere are we prisoners\xe2\x80\x94to ourselves, if you like\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nprisoners still, pent up in the rocks, seeing no one, hearing scarce an\r\necho from the knightly or the poet world, nor from all the wonders that\r\npass.  And the world has a history going on still, like the _Chronicle_.\r\nOh, Ebbo, think of being in the midst of life, with lance and sword, and\r\nseeing the Kaiser\xe2\x80\x94the Kaiser of the holy Roman Empire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith lance and sword, well and good; but would it were not at the cost\r\nof liberty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever Ebbo forbore to damp his mother\xe2\x80\x99s joy, save by the one\r\nwarning\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cUnderstand, mother, that I will not be pledged to anything.  I\r\nwill not bend to the yoke ere I have seen and judged for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe manly sound of the words gave a sweet sense of exultation to the\r\nmother, even while she dreaded the proud spirit, and whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cGod\r\ndirect thee, my son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCertainly Ebbo, hitherto the most impetuous and least thoughtful of the\r\ntwo lads, had a gravity and seriousness about him, that, but for his\r\nnaturally sweet temper, would have seemed sullen.  His aspirations for\r\nadventure had hitherto been more vehement than Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s; but, when the\r\ntime seemed at hand, his regrets at what he might have to yield\r\noverpowered his hopes of the future.  The fierce haughtiness of the old\r\nAdlersteins could not brook the descent from the crag, even while the\r\nkeen, clear burgher wit that Ebbo inherited from the other side of the\r\nhouse taught him that the position was untenable, and that his isolated\r\nglory was but a poor mean thing after all.  And the struggle made him sad\r\nand moody.\r\n\r\nFriedel, less proud, and with nothing to yield, was open to blithe\r\nanticipations of what his fancy pictured as the home of all the beauty,\r\nsacred or romantic, that he had glimpsed at through his mother.\r\nReligion, poetry, learning, art, refinement, had all come to him through\r\nher; and though he had a soul that dreamt and soared in the lonely\r\ngrandeur of the mountain heights, it craved further aliment for its\r\nyearnings for completeness and perfection.  Long ago had Friedel come to\r\nthe verge of such attainments as he could work out of his present\r\nmaterials, and keen had been his ardour for the means of progress, though\r\nonly the mountain tarn had ever been witness to the full outpouring of\r\nthe longings with which he gazed upon the dim, distant city like a land\r\nof enchantment.\r\n\r\nThe journey was to be at once, so as to profit by the escort of Master\r\nSorel\xe2\x80\x99s men.  Means of transport were scanty, but Ebbo did not choose\r\nthat the messengers should report the need, and bring back a bevy of\r\nanimals at the burgher\xe2\x80\x99s expense; so the mother was mounted on the old\r\nwhite mare, and her sons and Heinz trusted to their feet.  By setting out\r\nearly on a May morning, the journey could be performed ere night, and the\r\ntwilight would find them in the domains of the free city, where their\r\nsmall numbers would be of no importance.  As to their appearance, the\r\nmother wore a black woollen gown and mantle, and a black silk hood tied\r\nunder her chin, and sitting loosely round the stiff frame of her white\r\ncap\xe2\x80\x94a nun-like garb, save for the soft brown hair, parted over her brow,\r\nand more visible than she sometimes thought correct, but her sons would\r\nnot let her wear it out of sight.\r\n\r\nThe brothers had piece by piece surveyed the solitary suit of armour\r\nremaining in the castle; but, though it might serve for defence, it could\r\nnot be made fit for display, and they must needs be contented with blue\r\ncloth, spun, woven, dyed, fashioned, and sewn at home, chiefly by their\r\nmother, and by her embroidered on the breast with the white eagle of\r\nAdlerstein.  Short blue cloaks and caps of the same, with an eagle plume\r\nin each, and leggings neatly fashioned of deerskin, completed their\r\nequipments.  Ebbo wore his father\xe2\x80\x99s sword, Friedel had merely a dagger\r\nand crossbow.  There was not a gold chain, not a brooch, not an approach\r\nto an ornament among the three, except the medal that had always\r\ndistinguished Ebbo, and the coral rosary at Christina\xe2\x80\x99s girdle.  Her own\r\ntrinkets had gone in masses for the souls of her father and husband; and\r\nthough a few costly jewels had been found in Frau Kunigunde\xe2\x80\x99s hoards, the\r\nmode of their acquisition was so doubtful, that it had seemed fittest to\r\nbestow them in alms and masses for the good of her soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat ornament, what glory could any one desire better than two such\r\nsons?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Christina, as for the first time for eighteen years she\r\ncrossed the wild ravine where her father had led her, a trembling little\r\ncaptive, longing for wings like a dove\xe2\x80\x99s to flutter home again.  Who\r\nwould then have predicted that she should descend after so long and weary\r\na time, and with a gallant boy on either side of her, eager to aid her\r\nevery step, and reassure her at each giddy pass, all joy and hope before\r\nher and them?  Yet she was not without some dread and misgiving, as she\r\nwatched her elder son, always attentive to her, but unwontedly silent,\r\nwith a stern gravity on his young brow, a proud sadness on his lip.  And\r\nwhen he had come to the Debateable Ford, and was about to pass the\r\nboundaries of his own lands, he turned and gazed back on the castle and\r\nmountain with a silent but passionate ardour, as though he felt himself\r\ndoing them a wrong by perilling their independence.\r\n\r\nThe sun had lately set, and the moon was silvering the Danube, when the\r\ntravellers came full in view of the imperial free city, girt in with\r\nmighty walls and towers\xe2\x80\x94the vine-clad hill dominated by its crowning\r\nchurch; the irregular outlines of the unfinished spire of the cathedral\r\ntraced in mysterious dark lacework against the pearly sky; the lofty\r\nsteeple-like gate-tower majestically guarding the bridge.  Christina\r\nclasped her hands in thankfulness, as at the familiar face of a friend;\r\nFriedel glowed like a minstrel introduced to his fair dame, long wooed at\r\na distance; Ebbo could not but exclaim, \xe2\x80\x9cYea, truly, a great city is a\r\nsolemn and a glorious sight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gates were closed, and the serving-men had to parley at the barbican\r\nere the heavy door was opened to admit the party to the bridge, between\r\ndeep battlemented stone walls, with here and there loopholes, showing the\r\nshimmering of the river beneath.  The slow, tired tread of the old mare\r\nsounded hollow; the river rushed below with the full swell of evening\r\nloudness; a deep-toned convent-bell tolled gravely through the stillness,\r\nwhile, between its reverberations, clear, distinct notes of joyous music\r\nwere borne on the summer wind, and a nightingale sung in one of the\r\ngardens that bordered the banks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, it is all that I dreamt!\xe2\x80\x9d breathlessly murmured Friedel, as they\r\nhalted under the dark arch of the great gateway tower.\r\n\r\nNot however in Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s dreams had been the hearty voice that proceeded\r\nfrom the lighted guard-room in the thickness of the gateway.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFreiherrinn von Adlerstein!  Is it she?  Then must I greet my old\r\nplaymate!\xe2\x80\x9d  And the captain of the watch appeared among upraised lanterns\r\nand torches that showed a broad, smooth, plump face beneath a plain steel\r\nhelmet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWelcome, gracious lady, welcome to your old city.  What! do you not\r\nremember Lippus Grundt, your poor Valentine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster Philip Grundt!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Christina, amazed at the breadth of\r\nvisage and person; \xe2\x80\x9cand how fares it with my good Regina?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcellent well, good lady.  She manages her trade and house as well as\r\nthe good man Bartol\xc3\xa4us Fleischer himself.  Blithe will she be to show you\r\nher goodly ten, as I shall my eight,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, walking by her side;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand Barbara\xe2\x80\x94you remember Barbara Schmidt, lady\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Barbara?\xe2\x80\x94That do I indeed!  Is she your wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, truly, lady,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, in an odd sort of apologetic tone; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nsee, you returned not, and the housefathers, they would have it so\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nBarbara is a good housewife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly do I rejoice!\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, wishing she could convey to him how\r\nwelcome he had been to marry any one he liked, as far as she was\r\nconcerned\xe2\x80\x94he, in whom her fears of mincing goldsmiths had always taken\r\nform\xe2\x80\x94then signing with her hand, \xe2\x80\x9cI have my sons likewise to show her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, on foot!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Grundt, as a not well-conceived apology for not\r\nhaving saluted the young gentlemen.  \xe2\x80\x9cI greet you well, sirs,\xe2\x80\x9d with a\r\nbow, most haughtily returned by Ebbo, who was heartily wishing himself on\r\nhis mountain.  \xe2\x80\x9cTwo lusty, well-grown Junkern indeed, to whom my Martin\r\nwill be proud to show the humours of Ulm.  A fair good night, lady!  You\r\nwill find the old folks right cheery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell did Christina know the turn down the street, darkened by the\r\noverhanging brows of the tall houses, but each lower window laughing with\r\nthe glow of light within that threw out the heavy mullions and the\r\ncircles and diamonds of the latticework, and here and there the brilliant\r\ntints of stained glass sparkled like jewels in the upper panes, pictured\r\nwith Scripture scene, patron saint, or trade emblem.  The familiar porch\r\nwas reached, the familiar knock resounded on the iron-studded door.\r\nFriedel lifted his mother from her horse, and felt that she was quivering\r\nfrom head to foot, and at the same moment the light streamed from the\r\nopen door on the white horse, and the two young faces, one eager, the\r\nother with knit brows and uneasy eyes.  A kind of echo pervaded the\r\nhouse, \xe2\x80\x9cShe is come! she is come!\xe2\x80\x9d and as one in a dream Christina\r\nentered, crossed the well-known hall, looked up to her uncle and aunt on\r\nthe stairs, perceived little change on their countenances, and sank upon\r\nher knees, with bowed head and clasped hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy child! my dear child!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed her uncle, raising her with one\r\nhand, and crossing her brow in benediction with the other.  \xe2\x80\x9cArt thou\r\nindeed returned?\xe2\x80\x9d and he embraced her tenderly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWelcome, fair niece!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hausfrau Johanna, more formally.  \xe2\x80\x9cI am right\r\nglad to greet you here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear mother!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Christina, courting her fond embrace by\r\ngestures of the most eager affection, \xe2\x80\x9chow have I longed for this moment!\r\nand, above all, to show you my boys!  Herr Uncle, let me present my\r\nsons\xe2\x80\x94my Eberhard, my Friedmund.  O Housemother, are not my twins\r\nwell-grown lads?\xe2\x80\x9d  And she stood with a hand on each, proud that their\r\nheads were so far above her own, and looking still so slight and girlish\r\nin figure that she might better have been their sister than their mother.\r\nThe cloud that the sudden light had revealed on Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s brow had cleared\r\naway, and he made an inclination neither awkward nor ungracious in its\r\nfree mountain dignity and grace, but not devoid of mountain rusticity and\r\nshy pride, and far less cordial than was Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s manner.  Both were\r\ninfinitely relieved to detect nothing of the greasy burgher, and were\r\ngreatly struck with the fine venerable head before them; indeed, Friedel\r\nwould, like his mother, have knelt to ask a blessing, had he not been\r\nunder command not to outrun his brother\xe2\x80\x99s advances towards her kindred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWelcome, fair Junkern!\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Gottfried; \xe2\x80\x9cwelcome both for your\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s sake and your own!  These thy sons, my little one?\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\nsmiling.  \xe2\x80\x9cArt sure I neither dream nor see double!  Come to the gallery,\r\nand let me see thee better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, ceremoniously giving his hand, he proceeded to lead his niece up the\r\nstairs, while Ebbo, labouring under ignorance of city forms and\r\nuncertainty of what befitted his dignity, presented his hand to his aunt\r\nwith an air that half-amused, half-offended the shrewd dame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll is as if I had left you but yesterday!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Christina.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle, have you pardoned me?  You bade me return when my work was done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have known better, child.  Such return is not to be sought on\r\nthis side the grave.  Thy work has been more than I then thought of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! and now will you deem it begun\xe2\x80\x94not done!\xe2\x80\x9d softly said Christina,\r\nthough with too much heartfelt exultation greatly to doubt that all the\r\nworld must be satisfied with two such boys, if only Ebbo would be his\r\ntrue self.\r\n\r\nThe luxury of the house, the wainscoted and tapestried walls, the\r\npolished furniture, the lamps and candles, the damask linen, the rich\r\narray of silver, pewter, and brightly-coloured glass, were a great\r\ncontrast to the bare walls and scant necessaries of Schloss Adlerstein;\r\nbut Ebbo was resolved not to expose himself by admiration, and did his\r\nbest to stifle Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s exclamations of surprise and delight.  Were not\r\nthese citizens to suppose that everything was tenfold more costly at the\r\nbaronial castle?  And truly the boy deserved credit for the consideration\r\nfor his mother, which made him merely reserved, while he felt like a wild\r\neagle in a poultry-yard.  It was no small proof of his affection to\r\nforbear more interference with his mother\xe2\x80\x99s happiness than was the\r\ninevitable effect of that intuition which made her aware that he was\r\nchafing and ill at ease.  For his sake, she allowed herself to be placed\r\nin the seat of honour, though she longed, as of old, to nestle at her\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s feet, and be again his child; but, even while she felt each\r\nacceptance of a token of respect as almost an injury to them, every look\r\nand tone was showing how much the same Christina she had returned.\r\n\r\nIn truth, though her life had been mournful and oppressed, it had not\r\nbeen such as to age her early.  It had been all submission, without wear\r\nand tear of mind, and too simple in its trials for care and moiling; so\r\nthe fresh, lily-like sweetness of her maiden bloom was almost intact,\r\nand, much as she had undergone, her once frail health had been so braced\r\nby the mountain breezes, that, though delicacy remained, sickliness was\r\ngone from her appearance.  There was still the exquisite purity and\r\ntender modesty of expression, but with greater sweetness in the pensive\r\nbrown eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, little one!\xe2\x80\x9d said her uncle, after duly contemplating her; \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nchange is all for the better!  Thou art grown a wondrously fair dame.\r\nThere will scarce be a lovelier in the Kaiserly train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEbbo almost pardoned his great-uncle for being his great-uncle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen she is arrayed as becomes the Frau Freiherrinn,\xe2\x80\x9d said the housewife\r\naunt, looking with concern at the coarse texture of her black sleeve.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nlong to see our own lady ruffle it in her new gear.  I am glad that the\r\nlofty pointed cap has passed out; the coif becomes my child far better,\r\nand I see our tastes still accord as to fashion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFashion scarce came above the Debateable Ford,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, smiling.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear my boys look as if they came out of the _Weltgeschichte_, for I\r\ncould only shape their garments after my remembrance of the gallants of\r\neighteen years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir garments are your own shaping!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the aunt, now in an\r\naccent of real, not conventional respect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpinning and weaving, shaping and sewing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, coming near to\r\nlet the housewife examine the texture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClose woven, even threaded, smooth tinted!  Ah, Stina, thou didst learn\r\nsomething!  Thou wert not quite spoilt by the housefather\xe2\x80\x99s books and\r\ncarvings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell whose teachings have served me best, or been the most\r\nprecious to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, with clasped hands, looking from one to\r\nanother with earnest love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art a good child.  Ah! little one, forgive me; you look so like our\r\nchild that I cannot bear in mind that you are the Frau Freiherrinn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, I should deem myself in disgrace with you, did you keep me at a\r\ndistance, and not _thou_ me, as your little Stina,\xe2\x80\x9d she fondly answered,\r\nhalf regretting her fond eager movement, as Ebbo seemed to shrink\r\ntogether with a gesture perceived by her uncle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my young lord there who would not forgive the freedom,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\ngood-humouredly, though gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so,\xe2\x80\x9d Ebbo forced himself to say; \xe2\x80\x9cnot so, if it makes my mother\r\nhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe held up his head rather as if he thought it a fool\xe2\x80\x99s paradise, but\r\nMaster Gottfried answered: \xe2\x80\x9cThe noble Freiherr is, from all I have heard,\r\ntoo good a son to grudge his mother\xe2\x80\x99s duteous love even to burgher\r\nkindred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something in the old man\xe2\x80\x99s frank, dignified tone of grave\r\nreproof that at once impressed Ebbo with a sense of the true superiority\r\nof that wise and venerable old age to his own petulant baronial\r\nself-assertion.  He had both head and heart to feel the burgher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvictory, and with a deep blush, though not without dignity, he answered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly, sir, my mother has ever taught us to look up to you as her\r\nkindest and best\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was going to say \xe2\x80\x9cfriend,\xe2\x80\x9d but a look into the grand benignity of the\r\ncountenance completed the conquest, and he turned it into \xe2\x80\x9cfather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nFriedel at the same instant bent his knee, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is true what\r\nEbbo says!  We have both longed for this day.  Bless us, honoured uncle,\r\nas you have blessed my mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor in truth there was in the soul of the boy, who had never had any but\r\nwomen to look up to, a strange yearning towards reverence, which was\r\ncalled into action with inexpressible force by the very aspect and tone\r\nof such a sage elder and counsellor as Master Gottfried Sorel, and he\r\ntook advantage of the first opening permitted by his brother.  And the\r\nsympathy always so strong between the two quickened the like feeling in\r\nEbbo, so that the same movement drew him on his knee beside Friedel in\r\noblivion or renunciation of all lordly pride towards a kinsman such as he\r\nhad here encountered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly and heartily, my fair youths,\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Gottfried, with the\r\nsame kind dignity, \xe2\x80\x9cdo I pray the good God to bless you, and render you\r\nfaithful and loving sons, not only to your mother, but to your\r\nfatherland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was unable to distinguish between the two exactly similar forms that\r\nknelt before him, yet there was something in the quivering of Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead, which made him press it with a shade more of tenderness than the\r\nother.  And in truth tears were welling into the eyes veiled by the\r\nfingers that Friedel clasped over his face, for such a blessing was\r\nstrange and sweet to him.\r\n\r\nTheir mother was ready to weep for joy.  There was now no drawback to her\r\nbliss, since her son and her uncle had accepted one another; and she\r\nrepaired to her own beloved old chamber a happier being than she had been\r\nsince she had left its wainscoted walls.\r\n\r\nNay, as she gazed out at the familiar outlines of roof and tower, and\r\nfelt herself truly at home, then knelt by the little undisturbed altar of\r\nher devotions, with the cross above and her own patron saint below in\r\ncarved wood, and the flowers which the good aunt had ever kept as a\r\nfreshly renewed offering, she felt that she was happier, more fully\r\nthankful and blissful than even in the girlish calm of her untroubled\r\nlife.  Her prayer that she might come again in peace had been more than\r\nfulfilled; nay, when she had seen her boys kneel meekly to receive her\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s blessing, it was in some sort to her as if the work was done, as\r\nif the millstone had been borne up for her, and had borne her and her\r\ndear ones with it.\r\n\r\nBut there was much to come.  She knew full well that, even though her\r\nsons\xe2\x80\x99 first step had been in the right direction, it was in a path beset\r\nwith difficulties; and how would her proud Ebbo meet them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\nTHE EAGLETS IN THE CITY\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER having once accepted Master Gottfried, Ebbo froze towards him and\r\nDame Johanna no more, save that a naturally imperious temper now and then\r\nled to fitful stiffnesses and momentary haughtiness, which were easily\r\nexcused in one so new to the world and afraid of compromising his rank.\r\nIn general he could afford to enjoy himself with a zest as hearty as that\r\nof the simpler-minded Friedel.\r\n\r\nThey were early afoot, but not before the heads of the household were\r\ncoming forth for the morning devotions at the cathedral; and the streets\r\nwere stirring into activity, and becoming so peopled that the boys\r\nsupposed that it was a great fair day.  They had never seen so many\r\npeople together even at the Friedmund Wake, and it was several days\r\nbefore they ceased to exclaim at every passenger as a new curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe Dome Kirk awed and hushed them.  They had looked to it so long that\r\nperhaps no sublunary thing could have realized their expectations, and\r\nFriedel avowed that he did not know what he thought of it.  It was not\r\nsuch as he had dreamt, and, like a German as he was, he added that he\r\ncould not think, he could only feel, that there was something ineffable\r\nin it; yet he was almost disappointed to find his visions unfulfilled,\r\nand the hues of the painted glass less pure and translucent than those of\r\nthe ice crystals on the mountains.  However after his eye had become\r\ntrained, the deep influence of its dim solemn majesty, and of the echoes\r\nof its organ tones, and chants of high praise or earnest prayer, began to\r\nenchain his spirit; and, if ever he were missing, he was sure to be found\r\namong the mysteries of the cathedral aisles, generally with Ebbo, who\r\nfelt the spell of the same grave fascination, since whatever was true of\r\nthe one brother was generally true of the other.  They were essentially\r\nalike, though some phases of character and taste were more developed in\r\nthe one or the other.\r\n\r\nMaster Gottfried was much edified by their perfect knowledge of the names\r\nand numbers of his books.  They instantly, almost resentfully, missed the\r\nCicero\xe2\x80\x99s _Offices_ that he had parted with, and joyfully hailed his new\r\nacquisitions, often sitting with heads together over the same book,\r\nreading like active-minded youths who were used to out-of-door life and\r\nexercise in superabundant measure, and to study as a valued recreation,\r\nwith only food enough for the intellect to awaken instead of satisfying\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThey were delighted to obtain instruction from a travelling student, then\r\nattending the schools of Ulm\xe2\x80\x94a meek, timid lad who, for love of learning\r\nand desire of the priesthood, had endured frightful tyranny from the\r\nBacchanten or elder scholars, and, having at length attained that rank,\r\nhad so little heart to retaliate on the juniors that his contemporaries\r\ndespised him, and led him a cruel life until he obtained food and shelter\r\nfrom Master Gottfried at the pleasant cost of lessons to the young\r\nBarons.  Poor Bastien! this land of quiet, civility, and books was a\r\nforetaste of Paradise to him after the hard living, barbarity, and coarse\r\nvices of his comrades, of whom he now and then disclosed traits that made\r\nhis present pupils long to give battle to the big shaggy youths who used\r\nto send out the lesser lads to beg and steal for them, and cruelly\r\nmaltreated such as failed in the quest.\r\n\r\nLessons in music and singing were gladly accepted by both lads, and from\r\ntheir uncle\xe2\x80\x99s carving they could not keep their hands.  Ebbo had begun by\r\nenjoining Friedel to remember that the work that had been sport in the\r\nmountains would be basely mechanical in the city, and Friedel as usual\r\nyielded his private tastes; but on the second day Ebbo himself was\r\ndiscovered in the workshop, watching the magic touch of the deft workman,\r\nand he was soon so enticed by the perfect appliances as to take tool in\r\nhand and prove himself not unadroit in the craft.  Friedel however\r\nexcelled in delicacy of touch and grace and originality of conception,\r\nand produced such workmanship that Master Gottfried could not help\r\nstroking his hair and telling him it was a pity he was not born to belong\r\nto the guild.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot spare him, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ebbo; \xe2\x80\x9cpriest, scholar, minstrel,\r\nartist\xe2\x80\x94all want him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Hans of all streets, Ebbo?\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Friedel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd guildmaster of none,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9csave as a warrior; the rest only\r\nenough for a gentleman!  For what I am thou must be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Ebbo did not find fault with the skill Friedel was bestowing on his\r\nwork\xe2\x80\x94a carving in wood of a dove brooding over two young eagles\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ndevice that both were resolved to assume.  When their mother asked what\r\ntheir lady-loves would say to this, Ebbo looked up, and with the fullest\r\nconviction in his lustrous eyes declared that no love should ever rival\r\nhis motherling in his heart.  For truly her tender sweetness had given\r\nher sons\xe2\x80\x99 affection a touch of romance, for which Master Gottfried liked\r\nthem the better, though his wife thought their familiarity with her\r\nhardly accordant with the patriarchal discipline of the citizens.\r\n\r\nThe youths held aloof from these burghers, for Master Gottfried wisely\r\ndesired to give them time to be tamed before running risk of offence,\r\neither to, or by, their wild shy pride; and their mother contrived to\r\ntime her meetings with her old companions when her sons were otherwise\r\noccupied.  Master Gottfried made it known that the marriage portion he\r\nhad designed for his niece had been intrusted to a merchant trading in\r\npeltry to Muscovy, and the sum thus realized was larger than any bride\r\nhad yet brought to Adlerstein.  Master Gottfried would have liked to\r\ncontinue the same profitable speculations with it; but this would have\r\nbeen beyond the young Baron\xe2\x80\x99s endurance, and his eyes sparkled when his\r\nmother spoke of repairing the castle, refitting the chapel, having a\r\nresident chaplain, cultivating more land, increasing the scanty stock of\r\ncattle, and attempting the improvements hitherto prevented by lack of\r\nmeans.  He fervently declared that the motherling was more than equal to\r\nthe wise spinning Queen Bertha of legend and lay; and the first pleasant\r\nsense of wealth came in the acquisition of horses, weapons, and\r\nbraveries.  In his original mood, Ebbo would rather have stood before the\r\nDiet in his home-spun blue than have figured in cloth of gold at a\r\nburgher\xe2\x80\x99s expense; but he had learned to love his uncle, he regarded the\r\nmarriage portion as family property, and moreover he sorely longed to\r\nfeel himself and his brother well mounted, and scarcely less to see his\r\nmother in a velvet gown.\r\n\r\nHere was his chief point of sympathy with the housemother, who, herself\r\nprecluded from wearing miniver, velvet, or pearls, longed to deck her\r\nniece therewith, in time to receive Sir Kasimir of Adlerstein\r\nWildschloss, as he had promised to meet his godsons at Ulm.  The knight\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmarriage had lasted only a few years, and had left him no surviving\r\nchildren except one little daughter, whom he had placed in a nunnery at\r\nUlm, under the care of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s sister.  His lands lay higher up the\r\nDanube, and he was expected at Ulm shortly before the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s arrival.\r\nHe had been chiefly in Flanders with the King of the Romans, and had only\r\nreturned to Germany when the Netherlanders had refused the regency of\r\nMaximilian, and driven him out of their country, depriving him of the\r\ncustody of his children.\r\n\r\nPfingsttag, or Pentecost-day, was the occasion of Christina\xe2\x80\x99s first full\r\ntoilet, and never was bride more solicitously or exultingly arrayed than\r\nshe, while one boy held the mirror and the other criticized and admired\r\nas the aunt adjusted the pearl-bordered coif, and long white veil\r\nfloating over the long-desired black velvet dress.  How the two lads\r\nadmired and gazed, caring far less for their own new and noble attire!\r\nFriedel was indeed somewhat concerned that the sword by his side was so\r\nmuch handsomer than that which Ebbo wore, and which, for all its dinted\r\nscabbard and battered hilt, he was resolved never to discard.\r\n\r\nIt was a festival of brilliant joy.  Wreaths of flowers hung from the\r\nwindows; rich tapestries decked the Dome Kirk, and the relics were\r\ndisplayed in shrines of wonderful costliness of material and beauty of\r\nworkmanship; little birds, with thin cakes fastened to their feet, were\r\nlet loose to fly about the church, in strange allusion to the event of\r\nthe day; the clergy wore their most gorgeous robes; and the exulting\r\nmusic of the mass echoed from the vaults of the long-drawn aisles, and\r\nbrought a rapt look of deep calm ecstasy over Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s sensitive\r\nfeatures.  The beggars evidently considered a festival as a harvest-day,\r\nand crowded round the doors of the cathedral.  As the Lady of Adlerstein\r\ncame out leaning on Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s arm, with Friedel on her other side, they\r\nevidently attracted the notice of a woman whose thin brown face looked\r\nthe darker for the striped red and yellow silk kerchief that bound the\r\ndark locks round her brow, as, holding out a beringed hand, she fastened\r\nher glittering jet black eyes on them, and exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cAlms! if the fair\r\ndame and knightly Junkern would hear what fate has in store for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe meddle not with the future, I thank thee,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, seeing\r\nthat her sons, to whom gipsies were an amazing novelty, were in extreme\r\nsurprise at the fortune-telling proposal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet could I tell much, lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, still standing in the way.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would some here present give to know that the locks that were\r\nshrouded by the widow\xe2\x80\x99s veil ere ever they wore the matron\xe2\x80\x99s coif shall\r\nyet return to the coif once more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEbbo gave a sudden start of dismay and passion; his mother held him fast.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPush on, Ebbo, mine; heed her not; she is a mere Bohemian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how knew she your history, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Friedel, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat might be easily learnt at our Wake,\xe2\x80\x9d began Christina; but her steps\r\nwere checked by a call from Master Gottfried just behind.  \xe2\x80\x9cFrau\r\nFreiherrinn, Junkern, not so fast.  Here is your noble kinsman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA tall, fine-looking person, in the long rich robe worn on peaceful\r\noccasions, stood forth, doffing his eagle-plumed bonnet, and, as the lady\r\nturned and curtsied low, he put his knee to the ground and kissed her\r\nhand, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWell met, noble dame; I felt certain that I knew you when\r\nI beheld you in the Dome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was gazing at her all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Ebbo to his brother; while\r\ntheir mother, blushing, replied, \xe2\x80\x9cYou do me too much honour, Herr\r\nFreiherr.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce seen, never to be forgotten,\xe2\x80\x9d was the courteous answer: \xe2\x80\x9cand truly,\r\nbut for the stately height of these my godsons I would not believe how\r\nlong since our meeting was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereupon, in true German fashion, Sir Kasimir embraced each youth in the\r\nopen street, and then, removing his long, embroidered Spanish glove, he\r\noffered his hand, or rather the tips of his fingers, to lead the Frau\r\nChristina home.\r\n\r\nMaster Sorel had invited him to become his guest at a very elaborate\r\nornamental festival meal in honour of the great holiday, at which were to\r\nbe present several wealthy citizens with their wives and families, old\r\nconnections of the Sorel family.  Ebbo had resolved upon treating them\r\nwith courteous reserve and distance; but he was surprised to find his\r\ncousin of Wildschloss comporting himself among the burgomasters and their\r\ndames as freely as though they had been his equals, and to see that they\r\ntook such demeanour as perfectly natural.  Quick to perceive, the boy\r\ngathered that the gulf between noble and burgher was so great that no\r\nintimacy could bridge it over, no reserve widen it, and that his own\r\nbashful hauteur was almost a sign that he knew that the gulf had been\r\npassed by his own parents; but shame and consciousness did not enable him\r\nto alter his manner but rather added to its stiffness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Junker is like an Englishman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Kasimir, who had met many of\r\nthe exiles of the Roses at the court of Mary of Burgundy; and then he\r\nturned to discuss with the guildmasters the interruption to trade caused\r\nby Flemish jealousies.\r\n\r\nAfter the lengthy meal, the tables were removed, the long gallery was\r\noccupied by musicians, and Master Gottfried crossed the hall to tell his\r\neldest grandnephew that to him he should depute the opening of the dance\r\nwith the handsome bride of the Rathsherr, Ulrich Burger.  Ebbo blushed up\r\nto the eyes, and muttered that he prayed his uncle to excuse him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old citizen, really displeased; \xe2\x80\x9cthy kinsman might have\r\nproved to thee that it is no derogation of thy lordly dignity.  I have\r\nbeen patient with thee, but thy pride passes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Friedel hastily, raising his sweet candid face with a\r\nlook between shame and merriment, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not that; but you forget what\r\npoor mountaineers we are.  Never did we tread a measure save now and then\r\nwith our mother on a winter evening, and we know no more than a chamois\r\nof your intricate measures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaster Gottfried looked perplexed, for these dances were matters of great\r\npunctilio.  It was but seven years since the Lord of Praunstein had\r\ndefied the whole city of Frankfort because a damsel of that place had\r\nrefused to dance with one of his Cousins; and, though \xe2\x80\x9cFistright\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nletters of challenge had been made illegal, yet the whole city of Ulm\r\nwould have resented the affront put on it by the young lord of\r\nAdlerstein.  Happily the Freiherr of Adlerstein Wildschloss was at hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerr Burgomaster,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9clet me commence the dance with your fair\r\nlady niece.  By your testimony,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, smiling to the youths, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\r\ncan tread a measure.  And, after marking us, you may try your success\r\nwith the Rathsherrinn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristina would gladly have transferred her noble partner to the\r\nRathsherrinn, but she feared to mortify her good uncle and aunt further,\r\nand consented to figure alone with Sir Kasimir in one of the majestic,\r\ngraceful dances performed by a single couple before a gazing assembly.\r\nSo she let him lead her to her place, and they bowed and bent, swept past\r\none another, and moved in interlacing lines and curves, with a grand slow\r\nmovement that displayed her quiet grace and his stately port and courtly\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it not beautiful to see the motherling?\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel to his brother;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cshe sails like a white cloud in a soft wind.  And he stands grand as a\r\nstag at gaze.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike a malapert peacock, say I,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Ebbo; \xe2\x80\x9cdidst not see, Friedel,\r\nhow he kept his eyes on her in church?  My uncle says the Bohemians are\r\nmere deceivers.  Depend on it the woman had spied his insolent looks when\r\nshe made her ribald prediction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, who had been watching the steps rather than\r\nattending, \xe2\x80\x9cit will be easy to dance it now.  It is a figure my mother\r\nonce tried to teach us.  I remember it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen go and do it, since better may not be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, but it should be thou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho will know which of us it is?  I hated his presumption too much to\r\nmark his antics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFriedel came forward, and the substitution was undetected by all save\r\ntheir mother and uncle; by the latter only because, addressing Ebbo, he\r\nreceived a reply in a tone such as Friedel never used.\r\n\r\nNatural grace, quickness of ear and eye, and a skilful partner, rendered\r\nFriedel\xe2\x80\x99s so fair a performance that he ventured on sending his brother\r\nto attend the councilloress with wine and comfits; while he in his own\r\nperson performed another dance with the city dame next in pretension, and\r\ntheir mother was amused by Sir Kasimir\xe2\x80\x99s remark, that her second son\r\ndanced better than the elder, but both must learn.\r\n\r\nThe remark displeased Ebbo.  In his isolated castle he knew no superior,\r\nand his nature might yield willingly, but rebelled at being put down.\r\nHis brother was his perfect equal in all mental and bodily attributes,\r\nbut it was the absence of all self-assertion that made Ebbo so often give\r\nhim the preference; it was his mother\xe2\x80\x99s tender meekness in which lay her\r\npower with him; and if he yielded to Gottfried Sorel\xe2\x80\x99s wisdom and\r\nexperience, it was with the inward consciousness of voluntary deference\r\nto one of lower rank.  But here was Wildschloss, of the same noble blood\r\nwith himself, his elder, his sponsor, his protector, with every right to\r\ndirect him, so that there was no choice between grateful docility and\r\nheadstrong folly.  If the fellow had been old, weak, or in any way\r\ninferior, it would have been more bearable; but he was a tried warrior, a\r\nsage counsellor, in the prime vigour of manhood, and with a kindly\r\nreasonable authority to which only a fool could fail to attend, and which\r\nfor that very reason chafed Ebbo excessively.\r\n\r\nMoreover there was the gipsy prophecy ever rankling in the lad\xe2\x80\x99s heart,\r\nand embittering to him the sight of every civility from his kinsman to\r\nhis mother.  Sir Kasimir lodged at a neighbouring hostel; but he spent\r\nmuch time with his cousins, and tried to make them friends with his\r\nsquire, Count Rudiger.  A great offence to Ebbo was however the\r\ncriticisms of both knight and squire on the bearing of the young Barons\r\nin military exercises.  Truly, with no instructor but the rough\r\nlanzknecht Heinz, they must, as Friedel said, have been born paladins to\r\nhave equalled youths whose life had been spent in chivalrous training.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee us in a downright fight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo; \xe2\x80\x9cwe could strike as hard as any\r\ncourtly minion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs hard, but scarce as dexterously,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, \xe2\x80\x9cand be called for\r\nour pains the wild mountaineers.  I heard the men-at-arms saying I sat my\r\nhorse as though it were always going up or down a precipice; and Master\r\nSchmidt went into his shop the other day shrugging his shoulders, and\r\nsaying we hailed one another across the market-place as if we thought Ulm\r\nwas a mountain full of gemsbocks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou heardst! and didst not cast his insolence in his teeth?\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nEbbo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could I,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Friedel, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the echo was casting back in my\r\nteeth my own shout to thee?  I could only laugh with Rudiger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe chief delight I could have, next to getting home, would be to lay\r\nthat fellow Rudiger on his back in the tilt-yard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.\r\n\r\nBut, as Rudiger was by four years his senior, and very expert, the upshot\r\nof these encounters was quite otherwise, and the young gentlemen were\r\ndisabused of the notion that fighting came by nature, and found that, if\r\nthey desired success in a serious conflict, they must practise diligently\r\nin the city tilt-yard, where young men were trained to arms.  The\r\ncrossbow was the only weapon with which they excelled; and, as shooting\r\nwas a favourite exercise of the burghers, their proficiency was not as\r\nexclusive as had seemed to Ebbo a baronial privilege.  Harquebuses were\r\nnovelties to them, and they despised them as burgher weapons, in spite of\r\nSir Kasimir\xe2\x80\x99s assurance that firearms were a great subject of study and\r\ninterest to the King of the Romans.  The name of this personage was, it\r\nmay be feared, highly distasteful to the Freiherr von Adlerstein, both as\r\nWildschloss\xe2\x80\x99s model of knightly perfection, and as one who claimed\r\nsubmission from his haughty spirit.  When Sir Kasimir spoke to him on the\r\nsubject of giving his allegiance, he stiffly replied, \xe2\x80\x9cSir, that is a\r\nquestion for ripe consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the question,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildschloss, rather more lightly than agreed\r\nwith the Baron\xe2\x80\x99s dignity, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether you like to have your castle pulled\r\ndown about your ears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat has never happened yet to Adlerstein!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, proudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, because since the days of the Hohenstaufen there has been neither\r\nrule nor union in the empire.  But times are changing fast, my Junker,\r\nand within the last ten years forty castles such as yours have been\r\nconsumed by the Swabian League, as though they were so many walnuts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe shell of Adlerstein was too hard for them, though.  They never\r\ntried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd wherefore, friend Eberhard?  It was because I represented to the\r\nKaiser and the Graf von Wurtemberg that little profit and no glory would\r\naccrue from attacking a crag full of women and babes, and that I, having\r\nthe honour to be your next heir, should prefer having the castle\r\nuntouched, and under the peace of the empire, so long as that peace was\r\nkept.  When you should come to years of discretion, then it would be for\r\nyou to carry out the intention wherewith your father and grandfather left\r\nhome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we have been protected by the peace of the empire all this time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Friedel, while Ebbo looked as if the notion were hard of digestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so; and, had you not freely and nobly released your Genoese\r\nmerchant, it had gone hard with Adlerstein.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould Adlerstein be taken?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Ebbo triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour grandmother thought not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Kasimir, with a shade of irony\r\nin his tone.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a troublesome siege; but the League numbers\r\n1,500 horse, and 9,000 foot, and, with Schlangenwald\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence, you\r\nwould be assuredly starved out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEbbo was so much the more stimulated to take his chance, and do nothing\r\non compulsion; but Friedel put in the question to what the oaths would\r\nbind them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly to aid the Emperor with sword and counsel in field or Diet, and\r\nthereby win fame and honour such as can scarce be gained by carrying prey\r\nto yon eagle roost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne may preserve one\xe2\x80\x99s independence without robbery,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, lad: did you ever hear of a wolf that could live without marauding?\r\nOr if he tried, would he get credit for so doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not the present agreement hold till we\r\nare of age?  I suppose the Swabian League would attempt nothing against\r\nminors, unless we break the peace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProbably not; I will do my utmost to give the Freiherr there time to\r\ngrow beyond his grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s maxims,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildschloss.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nSchlangenwald do not meddle in the matter, he may have the next five\r\nyears to decide whether Adlerstein can hold out against all Germany.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFreiherr Kasimir von Adlerstein Wildschloss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eberhard, turning\r\nsolemnly on him, \xe2\x80\x9cI do you to wit once for all that threats will not\r\nserve with me.  If I submit, it will be because I am convinced it is\r\nright.  Otherwise we had rather both be buried in the ruins of our\r\ncastle, as its last free lords.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo!\xe2\x80\x9d said the provoking kinsman; \xe2\x80\x9csuch burials look grim when the time\r\ncomes, but happily it is not coming yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeantime, as Ebbo said to Friedel, how much might happen\xe2\x80\x94a disruption of\r\nthe empire, a crusade against the Turks, a war in Italy, some grand means\r\nof making the Diet value the sword of a free baron, without chaining him\r\ndown to gratify the greed of hungry Austria.  If only Wildschloss could\r\nbe shaken off!  But he only became constantly more friendly and\r\nintrusive, almost paternal.  No wonder, when the mother and her uncle\r\nmade him so welcome, and were so intolerably grateful for his impertinent\r\ninterference, while even Friedel confessed the reasonableness of his\r\ncounsels, as if that were not the very sting of them.\r\n\r\nHe even asked leave to bring his little daughter Thekla from her convent\r\nto see the Lady of Adlerstein.  She was a pretty, flaxen-haired maiden of\r\nfive years old, in a round cap, and long narrow frock, with a little\r\ncross at the neck.  She had never seen any one beyond the walls of the\r\nnunnery; and, when her father took her from the lay sister\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and\r\ncarried her to the gallery, where sat Hausfrau Johanna, in dark green,\r\nslashed with cherry colour, Master Gottfried, in sober crimson, with gold\r\nmedal and chain, Freiherrinn Christina, in silver-broidered black, and\r\nthe two Junkern stood near in the shining mail in which they were going\r\nto the tilt yard, she turned her head in terror, struggled with her\r\nscarce known father, and shrieked for Sister Grethel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was all too sheen,\xe2\x80\x9d she sobbed, in the lay sister\xe2\x80\x99s arms; \xe2\x80\x9cshe did\r\nnot want to be in Paradise yet, among the saints!  O! take her back!  The\r\ntwo bright, holy Michaels would let her go, for indeed she had made but\r\none mistake in her Ave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVain was the attempt to make her lift her face from the black serge\r\nshoulder where she had hidden it.  Sister Grethel coaxed and scolded, Sir\r\nKasimir reproved, the housemother offered comfits, and Christina\xe2\x80\x99s soft\r\nvoice was worst of all, for the child, probably taking her for Our Lady\r\nherself, began to gasp forth a general confession.  \xe2\x80\x9cI will never do so\r\nagain!  Yes, it was a fib, but Mother Hildegard gave me a bit of\r\nmarchpane not to tell\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d  Here the lay sister took strong measures for\r\nclosing the little mouth, and Christina drew back, recommending that the\r\nchild should be left gradually to discover their terrestrial nature.\r\nEbbo had looked on with extreme disgust, trying to hurry Friedel, who had\r\ndelayed to trace some lines for his mother on her broidery pattern.  In\r\npassing the step where Grethel sat with Thekla on her lap, the clank of\r\ntheir armour caused the uplifting of the little flaxen head, and two wide\r\nblue eyes looked over Grethel\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and met Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s sunny glance.\r\nHe smiled; she laughed back again.  He held out his arms, and, though his\r\nhands were gauntleted, she let him lift her up, and curiously smoothed\r\nand patted his cheek, as if he had been a strange animal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no wings,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.  \xe2\x80\x9cAre you St. George, or St. Michael?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither the one nor the other, pretty one.  Only your poor cousin\r\nFriedel von Adlerstein, and here is Ebbo, my brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not in Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s nature not to smile encouragement at the fair little\r\nface, with its wistful look.  He drew off his glove to caress her silken\r\nhair, and for a few minutes she was played with by the two brothers like\r\na newly-invented toy, receiving their attentions with pretty\r\nhalf-frightened graciousness, until Count Rudiger hastened in to summon\r\nthem, and Friedel placed her on his mother\xe2\x80\x99s knee, where she speedily\r\nbecame perfectly happy, and at ease.\r\n\r\nHer extreme delight, when towards evening the Junkern returned, was\r\nflattering even to Ebbo; and, when it was time for her to be taken home,\r\nshe made strong resistance, clinging fast to Christina, with screams and\r\nstruggles.  To the lady\xe2\x80\x99s promise of coming to see her she replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriedel and Ebbo, too,\xe2\x80\x9d and, receiving no response to this request, she\r\nburst out, \xe2\x80\x9cThen I won\xe2\x80\x99t come!  I am the Freiherrinn Thekla, the heiress\r\nof Adlerstein Wildschloss and Felsenbach.  I won\xe2\x80\x99t be a nun.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nmarried!  You shall be my husband,\xe2\x80\x9d and she made a dart at the nearest\r\nyouth, who happened to be Ebbo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, you shall have him.  He will come for you, sweetest Fraulein,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the perplexed Grethel, \xe2\x80\x9cso only you will come home!  Nobody will\r\ncome for you if you are naughty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you come if I am good?\xe2\x80\x9d said the spoilt cloister pet, clinging\r\ntight to Ebbo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father, as she still resisted, \xe2\x80\x9ccome back, my child, and\r\none day shall you see Ebbo, and have him for a brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereat Ebbo shook off the little grasping fingers, almost as if they had\r\nbelonged to a noxious insect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe matron\xe2\x80\x99s coif should succeed the widow\xe2\x80\x99s veil.\xe2\x80\x9d  He might talk with\r\nscholarly contempt of the new race of Bohemian impostors; but there was\r\nno forgetting that sentence.  And in like manner, though his\r\ngrandmother\xe2\x80\x99s allegation that his mother had been bent on captivating Sir\r\nKasimir in that single interview at Adlerstein, had always seemed to him\r\nthe most preposterous of all Kunigunde\xe2\x80\x99s forms of outrage, the\r\nrecollection would recur to him; and he could have found it in his heart\r\nto wish that his mother had never heard of the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s designs as to\r\nthe oubliette.  He did most sincerely wish Master Gottfried had never let\r\nWildschloss know of the mode in which his life had been saved.  Yet,\r\nwhile it would have seemed to him profane to breathe even to Friedel the\r\ntrue secret of his repugnance to this meddlesome kinsman, it was\r\nabsolutely impossible to avoid his most distasteful authority and\r\npatronage.\r\n\r\nAnd the mother herself was gently, thankfully happy and unsuspicious,\r\nbasking in the tender home affection of which she had so long been\r\ndeprived, proud of her sons, and, though anxious as to Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s decision,\r\nwith a quiet trust in his foundation of principle, and above all trusting\r\nto prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\nTHE DOUBLE-HEADED EAGLE\r\n\r\n\r\nONE summer evening, when shooting at a bird on a pole was in full\r\nexercise in the tilt-yard, the sports were interrupted by a message from\r\nthe Provost that a harbinger had brought tidings that the Imperial court\r\nwas within a day\xe2\x80\x99s journey.\r\n\r\nAll was preparation.  Fresh sand had to be strewn on the arena.  New\r\ntapestry hangings were to deck the galleries, the houses and balconies to\r\nbe brave with drapery, the fountain in the market-place was to play Rhine\r\nwine, all Ulm was astir to do honour to itself and to the Kaisar, and\r\nEbbo stood amid all the bustle, drawing lines in the sand with the stock\r\nof his arblast, subject to all that oppressive self-magnification so\r\nfrequent in early youth, and which made it seem to him as if the Kaisar\r\nand the King of the Romans were coming to Ulm with the mere purpose of\r\ndestroying his independence, and as if the eyes of all Germany were\r\nwatching for his humiliation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee! see!\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly exclaimed Friedel; \xe2\x80\x9clook! there is something among\r\nthe tracery of the Dome Kirk Tower.  Is it man or bird?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBird, folly!  Thou couldst see no bird less than an eagle from hence,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt they are about to hoist a banner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not their wont,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sir Kasimir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see him,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cNay, but he is a bold climber!  We went\r\nup to that stage, close to the balcony, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no footing beyond but\r\ncrockets and canopies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a bit of rotten scaffold,\xe2\x80\x9d added Friedel.  \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he is a builder\r\ngoing to examine it!  Up higher, higher!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA builder!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo; \xe2\x80\x9ca man with a head and foot like that should be a\r\nchamois hunter!  Shouldst thou deem it worse than the Red Eyrie,\r\nFriedel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea, truly!  The depth beneath is plainer!  There would be no climbing\r\nthere without\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout what, cousin?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Wildschloss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout great cause,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is fearful!  He is like a fly\r\nagainst the sky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeaten again!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Ebbo; \xe2\x80\x9cI did think that none of these town-bred\r\nfellows could surpass us when it came to a giddy height!  Who can he be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook! look!\xe2\x80\x9d burst out Friedel.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe saints protect him!  He is on that\r\nnarrowest topmost ledge\xe2\x80\x94measuring; his heel is over the parapet\xe2\x80\x94half his\r\nfoot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHolding on by the rotten scaffold pole!  St. Barbara be his speed; but\r\nhe is a brave man!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cOh! the pole has broken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forefend!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Wildschloss, with despair on his face unseen by\r\nthe boys, for Friedel had hidden his eyes, and Ebbo was straining his\r\nwith the intense gaze of horror.  He had carried his glance downwards,\r\nfollowing the 380 feet fall that must be the lot of the adventurer.  Then\r\nlooking up again he shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cI see him!  I see him!  Praise to St.\r\nBarbara!  He is safe!  He has caught by the upright stone work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere? where?  Show me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Wildschloss, grasping Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! clinging to that upright bit of tracery, stretching his foot out\r\nto yonder crocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot see.  Mine eyes swim and dazzle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildschloss.  \xe2\x80\x9cMerciful\r\nheavens! is this another tempting of Providence?  How is it with him now,\r\nEbbo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwarming down another slender bit of the stone network.  It must be easy\r\nnow to one who could keep head and hand steady in such a shock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d added Friedel, after a breathless space, \xe2\x80\x9che is on the lower\r\nparapet, whence begins the stair.  Do you know him, sir?  Who is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEither a Venetian mountebank,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildschloss, \xe2\x80\x9cor else there is only\r\none man I know of either so foolhardy or so steady of head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe he who he may,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9che is the bravest man that ever I beheld.\r\nWho is he, Sir Kasimir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn eagle of higher flight than ours, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildschloss.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\ncome; we shall reach the Dome Kirk by the time the climber has wound his\r\nway down the turret stairs, and we shall see what like he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir coming was well timed, for a small door at the foot of the tower\r\nwas just opening to give exit to a very tall knight, in one of those\r\nshort Spanish cloaks the collar of which could be raised so as to conceal\r\nthe face.  He looked to the right and left, and had one hand raised to\r\nput up the collar when he recognized Sir Kasimir, and, holding out both\r\nhands, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cHa, Adlerstein! well met!  I looked to see thee here.\r\nNo unbonneting; I am not come yet.  I am at Strasburg, with the Kaisar\r\nand the Archduke, and am not here till we ride in, in purple and in pall\r\nby the time the good folk have hung out their arras, and donned their\r\ngold chains, and conned their speeches, and mounted their mules.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell that their speeches are not over the lykewake of his kingly\r\nkaisarly highness,\xe2\x80\x9d gravely returned Sir Kasimir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!  Thou sawest?  I came out here to avoid the gaping throng, who don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what a hunter can do.  I have been in worse case in the Tyrol.\r\nSnowdrifts are worse footing than stone vine leaves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere abides your highness?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Wildschloss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ride back again to the halting-place for the night, and meet my father\r\nin time to do my part in the pageant.  I was sick of the addresses, and,\r\nmoreover, the purse-proud Flemings have made such a stiff little fop of\r\nmy poor boy that I am ashamed to look at him, or hear his French accent.\r\nSo I rode off to get a view of this notable Dom in peace, ere it be\r\nbedizened in holiday garb; and one can\xe2\x80\x99t stir without all the Chapter\r\nwaddling after one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour highness has found means of distancing them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, truly, the Prior would scarce delight in the view from yonder\r\nparapet,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed his highness.  \xe2\x80\x9cHa!  Adlerstein, where didst get such a\r\nperfect pair of pages?  I would I could match my hounds as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are no pages of mine, so please you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight; \xe2\x80\x9crather this\r\nis the head of my name.  Let me present to your kingly highness the\r\nFreiherr von Adlerstein.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou dost not thyself distinguish between them!\xe2\x80\x9d said Maximilian, as\r\nFriedmund stepped back, putting forward Eberhard, whose bright, lively\r\nsmile of interest and admiration had been the cause of his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmistake.  They would have doffed their caps and bent the knee, but were\r\nhastily checked by Maximilian.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Junkern, I shall owe you no\r\nthanks for bringing all the street on me!\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s enough.  Reserve the\r\nrest for Kaisar Fritz.\xe2\x80\x9d  Then, familiarly taking Sir Kasimir\xe2\x80\x99s arm, he\r\nwalked on, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI remember now.  Thou wentest after an inheritance\r\nfrom the old Mouser of the Debateable Ford, and wert ousted by a couple\r\nof lusty boys sprung of a peasant wedlock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, my lord, of a burgher lady, fair as she is wise and virtuous; who,\r\nspite of all hindrances, has bred up these youths in all good and noble\r\nnurture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this so?\xe2\x80\x9d said the king, turning sharp round on the twins.  \xe2\x80\x9cAre ye\r\nminded to quit freebooting, and come a crusading against the Turks with\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverywhere with such a leader!\xe2\x80\x9d enthusiastically exclaimed Ebbo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? up there?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maximilian, smiling.  \xe2\x80\x9cThou hast the tread of a\r\nchamois-hunter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriedel has been on the Red Eyrie,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ebbo; then, thinking he\r\nhad spoken foolishly, he coloured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is the Red Eyrie?\xe2\x80\x9d good-humouredly asked the king.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the crag above our castle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, modestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone other has been there,\xe2\x80\x9d added Ebbo, perceiving his auditor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninterest; \xe2\x80\x9cbut he saw the eagle flying away with a poor widow\xe2\x80\x99s kid, and\r\nthe sight must have given him wings, for we never could find the same\r\npath; but here is one of the feathers he brought down\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94taking off his cap\r\nso as to show a feather rather the worse for wear, and sheltered behind a\r\nfresher one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, \xe2\x80\x9cthou shouldst say that I came to a ledge where I\r\nhad like to have stayed all night, but that ye all came out with men and\r\nropes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe know what such a case is!\xe2\x80\x9d said the king.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt has chanced to us to\r\nhang between heaven and earth; I\xe2\x80\x99ve even had the Holy Sacrament held up\r\nfor my last pious gaze by those who gave me up for lost on the\r\nmountain-side.  Adlerstein?  The peak above the Braunwasser?  Some day\r\nshall ye show me this eyrie of yours, and we will see whether we can\r\namaze our cousins the eagles.  We see you at our father\xe2\x80\x99s court\r\nto-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d he graciously added, and Ebbo gave a ready bow of\r\nacquiescence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king, as after their dismissal he walked on with Sir\r\nKasimir, \xe2\x80\x9cnever blame me for rashness and imprudence.  Here has this\r\nheight of the steeple proved the height of policy.  It has made a loyal\r\nsubject of a Mouser on the spot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray Heaven it may have won a heart, true though proud!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nWildschloss; \xe2\x80\x9cbut mousing was cured before by the wise training of the\r\nmother.  Your highness will have taken out the sting of submission, and\r\nyou will scarce find more faithful subjects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old are the Junkern?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome sixteen years, your highness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what living among mountains does for a lad.  Why could not those\r\nthrice-accursed Flemish towns let me breed up my boy to be good for\r\nsomething in the mountains, instead of getting duck-footed and\r\nmuddy-witted in the fens?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Ebbo and Friedel were returning home in that sort of\r\npassion of enthusiasm that ingenuous boyhood feels when first brought\r\ninto contact with greatness or brilliant qualities.\r\n\r\nAnd brilliance was the striking point in Maximilian.  The Last of the\r\nKnights, in spite of his many defects, was, by personal qualities, and\r\nthe hereditary influence of long-descended rank, verily a king of men in\r\naspect and demeanour, even when most careless and simple.  He was at this\r\ntime a year or two past thirty, unusually tall, and with a form at once\r\nmajestic and full of vigour and activity; a noble, fair, though sunburnt\r\ncountenance; eyes of dark gray, almost black; long fair hair, a keen\r\naquiline nose, a lip only beginning to lengthen to the characteristic\r\nAustrian feature, an expression always lofty, sometimes dreamy, and yet\r\nat the same time full of acuteness and humour.  His abilities were of the\r\nhighest order, his purposes, especially at this period of his life, most\r\nnoble and becoming in the first prince of Christendom; and, if his life\r\nwere a failure, and his reputation unworthy of his endowments, the cause\r\nseems to have been in great measure the bewilderment and confusion that\r\nunusual gifts sometimes cause to their possessor, whose sight their\r\nconflicting illumination dazzles so as to impair his steadiness of aim,\r\nwhile their contending gleams light him into various directions, so that\r\none object is deserted for another ere its completion.  Thus Maximilian\r\ncuts a figure in history far inferior to that made by his grandson,\r\nCharles V., whom he nevertheless excelled in every personal quality,\r\nexcept the most needful of all, force of character; and, in like manner,\r\nhis remote descendant, the narrow-minded Ferdinand of Styria, gained his\r\nends, though the able and brilliant Joseph II. was to die broken-hearted,\r\ncalling his reign a failure and mistake.  However, such terms as these\r\ncould not be applied to Maximilian with regard to home affairs.  He has\r\nhad hard measure from those who have only regarded his vacillating\r\nforeign policy, especially with respect to Italy\xe2\x80\x94ever the temptation and\r\nthe bane of Austria; but even here much of his uncertain conduct was\r\nowing to the unfulfilled promises of what he himself called his \xe2\x80\x9crealm of\r\nkings,\xe2\x80\x9d and a sovereign can only justly be estimated by his domestic\r\npolicy.  The contrast of the empire before his time with the subsequent\r\nGermany is that of chaos with order.  Since the death of Friedrich II.\r\nthe Imperial title had been a mockery, making the prince who chanced to\r\nbear it a mere mark for the spite of his rivals; there was no centre of\r\njustice, no appeal; everybody might make war on everybody, with the sole\r\npreliminary of exchanging a challenge; \xe2\x80\x9cfist-right\xe2\x80\x9d was the acknowledged\r\nlaw of the land; and, except in the free cities, and under such a happy\r\naccident as a right-minded prince here and there, the state of Germany\r\nseems to have been rather worse than that of Scotland from Bruce to the\r\nunion of the Crowns.  Under Maximilian, the Diet became an effective\r\ncouncil, fist-right was abolished, independent robber-lords put down,\r\ncivilization began to effect an entrance, the system of circles was\r\narranged, and the empire again became a leading power in Europe, instead\r\nof a mere vortex of disorder and misrule.  Never would Charles V. have\r\nheld the position he occupied had he come after an ordinary man, instead\r\nof after an able and sagacious reformer like that Maximilian who is\r\npopularly regarded as a fantastic caricature of a knight-errant, marred\r\nby avarice and weakness of purpose.\r\n\r\nAt the juncture of which we are writing, none of Maximilian\xe2\x80\x99s less worthy\r\nqualities had appeared; he had not been rendered shifty and unscrupulous\r\nby difficulties and disappointments in money matters, and had not found\r\nit impossible to keep many of the promises he had given in all good\r\nfaith.  He stood forth as the hope of Germany, in salient contrast to the\r\nfeeble and avaricious father, who was felt to be the only obstacle in the\r\nway of his noble designs of establishing peace and good discipline in the\r\nempire, and conducting a general crusade against the Turks, whose\r\nprogress was the most threatening peril of Christendom.  His fame was, of\r\ncourse, frequently discussed among the citizens, with whom he was very\r\npopular, not only from his ease and freedom of manner, but because his\r\ngraceful tastes, his love of painting, sculpture, architecture, and the\r\nmechanical turn which made him an improver of fire-arms and a patron of\r\npainting and engraving, rendered their society more agreeable to him than\r\nthat of his dull, barbarous nobility.  Ebbo had heard so much of the\r\nperfections of the King of the Romans as to be prepared to hate him; but\r\nthe boy, as we have seen, was of a generous, sensitive nature, peculiarly\r\nprone to enthusiastic impressions of veneration; and Maximilian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhigh-spirited manhood, personal fascination, and individual kindness had\r\nso entirely taken him by surprise, that he talked of him all the evening\r\nin a more fervid manner than did even Friedel, though both could scarcely\r\nrest for their anticipations of seeing him on the morrow in the full\r\nstate of his entry.\r\n\r\nRichly clad, and mounted on cream-coloured steeds, nearly as much alike\r\nas themselves, the twins were a pleasant sight for a proud mother\xe2\x80\x99s eyes,\r\nas they rode out to take their place in the procession that was to\r\nwelcome the royal guests.  Master Sorel, in ample gown, richly furred,\r\nwith medal and chain of office, likewise went forth as Guildmaster; and\r\nChristina, with smiling lips and liquid eyes, recollected the days when\r\nto see him in such array was her keenest pleasure, and the utmost\r\nsplendour her fancy could depict.\r\n\r\nArrayed, as her sons loved to see her, in black velvet, and with\r\npearl-bordered cap, Christina sat by her aunt in the tapestried balcony,\r\nand between them stood or sat little Thekla von Adlerstein Wildschloss,\r\nwhose father had entrusted her to their care, to see the procession pass\r\nby.  A rich Eastern carpet, of gorgeous colouring, covered the upper\r\nbalustrade, over which they leant, in somewhat close quarters with the\r\nscarlet-bodiced dames of the opposite house, but with ample space for\r\nsight up and down the rows of smiling expectants at each balcony, or\r\nwindow, equally gay with hangings, while the bells of all the churches\r\nclashed forth their gayest chimes, and fitful bursts of music were borne\r\nupon the breeze.  Little Thekla danced in the narrow space for very glee,\r\nand wondered why any one should live in a cloister when the world was so\r\nwide and so fair.  And Dame Johanna tried to say something pious of\r\nworldly temptations, and the cloister shelter; but Thekla interrupted\r\nher, and, clinging to Christina, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cNay, but I am always naughty\r\nwith Mother Ludmilla in the convent, and I know I should never be naughty\r\nout here with you and the barons; I should be so happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! hush! little one; here they come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn they came\xe2\x80\x94stout lanzknechts first, the city guard with steel helmets\r\nunadorned, buff suits, and bearing either harquebuses, halberts, or those\r\nhandsome but terrible weapons, morning stars.  Then followed guild after\r\nguild, each preceded by the banner bearing its homely emblem\xe2\x80\x94the cauldron\r\nof the smiths, the hose of the clothiers, the helmet of the armourers,\r\nthe bason of the barbers, the boot of the sutors; even the sausage of the\r\ncooks, and the shoe of the shoeblacks, were re-presented, as by men who\r\ngloried in the calling in which they did life\xe2\x80\x99s duty and task.\r\n\r\nFirst in each of these bands marched the prentices, stout, broad,\r\nflat-faced lads, from twenty to fourteen years of age, with hair like tow\r\nhanging from under their blue caps, staves in their hands, and knives at\r\ntheir girdles.  Behind them came the journeymen, in leathern jerkins and\r\nsteel caps, and armed with halberts or cross-bows; men of all ages, from\r\nsixty to one or two and twenty, and many of the younger ones with foreign\r\ncountenances and garb betokening that they were strangers spending part\r\nof their wandering years in studying the Ulm fashions of their craft.\r\nEach trade showed a large array of these juniors; but the masters who\r\ncame behind were comparatively few, mostly elderly, long-gowned,\r\ngold-chained personages, with a weight of solid dignity on their wise\r\nbrows\xe2\x80\x94men who respected themselves, made others respect them, and kept\r\ntheir city a peaceful, well-ordered haven, while storms raged in the\r\nrealm beyond\xe2\x80\x94men too who had raised to the glory of their God a temple,\r\nnot indeed fulfilling the original design, but a noble effort, and grand\r\nmonument of burgher devotion.\r\n\r\nThen came the ragged regiment of scholars, wild lads from every part of\r\nGermany and Switzerland, some wan and pinched with hardship and\r\nprivation, others sturdy, selfish rogues, evidently well able to take\r\ncare of themselves.  There were many rude, tyrannical-looking lads among\r\nthe older lads; and, though here and there a studious, earnest face might\r\nbe remarked, the prospect of Germany\xe2\x80\x99s future priests and teachers was\r\nnot encouraging.  And what a searching ordeal was awaiting those careless\r\nlads when the voice of one, as yet still a student, should ring through\r\nGermany!\r\n\r\nContrasting with these ill-kempt pupils marched the grave professors and\r\nteachers, in square ecclesiastic caps and long gowns, whose colours\r\nmarked their degrees and the Universities that had conferred them\xe2\x80\x94some\r\nthin, some portly, some jocund, others dreamy; some observing all the\r\nhumours around, others still intent on Aristotelian ethics; all men of\r\nhigh fame, with doctor at the beginning of their names, and \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cus\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nat the close of them.  After them rode the magistracy, a burgomaster from\r\neach guild, and the Herr Provost himself\xe2\x80\x94as great a potentate within his\r\nown walls as the Doge of Venice or of Genoa, or perhaps greater, because\r\nless jealously hampered.  In this dignified group was Uncle Gottfried, by\r\ncomplacent nod and smile acknowledging his good wife and niece, who\r\nindeed had received many a previous glance and bow from friends passing\r\nbeneath.  But Master Sorel was no new spectacle in a civic procession,\r\nand the sight of him was only a pleasant fillip to the excitement of his\r\nladies.\r\n\r\nHere was jingling of spurs and trampling of horses; heraldic achievements\r\nshowed upon the banners, round which rode the mail-clad retainers of\r\ncountry nobles who had mustered to meet their lords.  Then, with still\r\nmore of clank and tramp, rode a bright-faced troop of lads, with\r\nfeathered caps and gay mantles.  Young Count Rudiger looked up with\r\ncourteous salutation; and just behind him, with smiling lips and upraised\r\nfaces, were the pair whose dark eyes, dark hair, and slender forms\r\nrendered them conspicuous among the fair Teutonic youth.  Each cap was\r\ntaken off and waved, and each pair of lustrous eyes glanced up pleasure\r\nand exultation at the sight of the lovely \xe2\x80\x9cMutterlein.\xe2\x80\x9d  And she?  The\r\npageant was well-nigh over to her, save for heartily agreeing with Aunt\r\nJohanna that there was not a young noble of them all to compare with the\r\ntwin Barons of Adlerstein!  However, she knew she should be called to\r\naccount if she did not look well at \xe2\x80\x9cthe Romish King;\xe2\x80\x9d besides, Thekla\r\nwas shrieking with delight at the sight of her father, tall and splendid\r\non his mighty black charger, with a smile for his child, and for the lady\r\na bow so low and deferential that it was evidently remarked by those at\r\nwhose approach every lady in the balconies was rising, every head in the\r\nstreet was bared.\r\n\r\nA tall, thin, shrivelled, but exceedingly stately old man on a gray horse\r\nwas in the centre.  Clad in a purple velvet mantle, and bowing as he\r\nwent, he looked truly the Kaisar, to whom stately courtesy was second\r\nnature.  On one side, in black and gold, with the jewel of the Golden\r\nFleece on his breast, rode Maximilian, responding gracefully to the\r\nsalutations of the people, but his keen gray eye roving in search of the\r\nobject of Sir Kasimir\xe2\x80\x99s salute, and lighting on Christina with such a\r\nrapid, amused glance of discovery that, in her confusion, she missed what\r\nexcited Dame Johanna\xe2\x80\x99s rapturous admiration\xe2\x80\x94the handsome boy on the\r\nEmperor\xe2\x80\x99s other side, a fair, plump lad, the young sovereign of the Low\r\nCountries, beautiful in feature and complexion, but lacking the fire and\r\nthe loftiness that characterized his father\xe2\x80\x99s countenance.  The train was\r\nclosed by the Reitern of the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s guard\xe2\x80\x94steel-clad mercenaries who\r\nwere looked on with no friendly eyes by the few gazers in the street who\r\nhad been left behind in the general rush to keep up with the attractive\r\npart of the show.\r\n\r\nPageants of elaborate mythological character impeded the imperial\r\nprogress at every stage, and it was full two hours ere the two youths\r\nreturned, heartily weary of the lengthened ceremonial, and laughing at\r\nhaving actually seen the King of the Romans enduring to be conducted from\r\nshrine to shrine in the cathedral by a large proportion of its\r\ndignitaries.  Ebbo was sure he had caught an archly disconsolate wink!\r\n\r\nEbbo had to dress for the banquet spread in the town-hall.  Space was\r\nwanting for the concourse of guests, and Master Sorel had decided that\r\nthe younger Baron should not be included in the invitation.  Friedel\r\npardoned him more easily than did Ebbo, who not only resented any slight\r\nto his double, but in his fits of shy pride needed the aid of his readier\r\nand brighter other self.  But it might not be, and Sir Kasimir and Master\r\nGottfried alone accompanied him, hoping that he would not look as wild as\r\na hawk, and would do nothing to diminish the favourable impression he had\r\nmade on the King of the Romans.\r\n\r\nLate, according to medi\xc3\xa6val hours, was the return, and Ebbo spoke in a\r\ntone of elation.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Kaisar was most gracious, and the king knew me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cand asked for thee, Friedel, saying one of us was nought\r\nwithout the other.  But thou wilt go to-morrow, for we are to receive\r\nknighthood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlready!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Friedel, a bright glow rushing to his cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Romish king said somewhat about waiting to win\r\nour spurs; but the Kaisar said I was in a position to take rank as a\r\nknight, and I thanked him, so thou shouldst share the honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Kaisar,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildschloss, \xe2\x80\x9cis not the man to let a knight\xe2\x80\x99s fee\r\nslip between his fingers.  The king would have kept off their grip, and\r\nreserved you for knighthood from his own sword under the banner of the\r\nempire; but there is no help for it now, and you must make your vassals\r\nsend in their dues.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy vassals?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat could they send?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe aid customary on the knighthood of the heir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there is\xe2\x80\x94there is nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel.  \xe2\x80\x9cThey can scarce pay meal\r\nand poultry enough for our daily fare; and if we were to flay them alive,\r\nwe should not get sixty groschen from the whole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue enough!  Knighthood must wait till we win it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, gloomily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, it is accepted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildschloss.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Kaisar loves his iron\r\nchest too well to let you go back.  You must be ready with your round sum\r\nto the chancellor, and your spur-money and your fee to the heralds, and\r\nlargess to the crowd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, the dowry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt your service, my son,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, anxious to chase the cloud\r\nfrom his brow.\r\n\r\nBut it was a deep haul, for the avaricious Friedrich IV. made exorbitant\r\ncharges for the knighting his young nobles; and Ebbo soon saw that the\r\nimprovements at home must suffer for the honours that would have been so\r\nmuch better won than bought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your vassals cannot aid, yet may not your kinsman\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d began\r\nWildschloss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Ebbo, lashed up to hot indignation.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir!  Rather\r\nwill my mother, brother, and I ride back this very night to unfettered\r\nliberty on our mountain, without obligation to any living man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLess hotly, Sir Baron,\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Gottfried, gravely.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou broke in\r\non your noble godfather, and you had not heard me speak.  You and your\r\nbrother are the old man\xe2\x80\x99s only heirs, nor do ye incur any obligation that\r\nneed fret you by forestalling what would be your just right.  I will see\r\nmy nephews as well equipped as any young baron of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mother looked anxiously at Ebbo.  He bent his head with rising\r\ncolour, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThanks, kind uncle.  From _you_ I have learnt to look\r\non goodness as fatherly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly,\xe2\x80\x9d added Friedel, \xe2\x80\x9cif the Baron\xe2\x80\x99s station renders knighthood fitting\r\nfor him, surely I might remain his esquire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, Friedel!\xe2\x80\x9d cried his brother.  \xe2\x80\x9cWithout thee, nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell said, Freiherr,\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Sorel; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat becomes the one becomes\r\nthe other.  I would not have thee left out, my Friedel, since I cannot\r\nleave thee the mysteries of my craft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow!\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, gravely.  \xe2\x80\x9cThen must the vigil be kept\r\nto-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe boy thinks these are the days of Roland and Karl the Great,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nWildschloss.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe would fain watch his arms in the moonlight in the Dome\r\nKirk!  Alas! no, my Friedel!  Knighthood in these days smacks more of\r\nbezants than of deeds of prowess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnbearable fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ebbo, when he had latched the door of the room\r\nhe shared with his brother.  \xe2\x80\x9cFirst, holding up my inexperience to scorn!\r\nAs though the Kaisar knew not better than he what befits me!  Then trying\r\nto buy my silence and my mother\xe2\x80\x99s gratitude with his hateful advance of\r\ngold.  As if I did not loathe him enough without!  If I pay my homage,\r\nand sign the League to-morrow, it will be purely that he may not plume\r\nhimself on our holding our own by sufferance, in deference to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will sign it\xe2\x80\x94you will do homage!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Friedel.  \xe2\x80\x9cHow rejoiced\r\nthe mother will be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had rather depend at once\xe2\x80\x94if depend I must\xe2\x80\x94on yonder dignified Kaisar\r\nand that noble king than on our meddling kinsman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cI shall\r\nbe his equal now!  Ay, and no more classed with the court Junkern I was\r\nwith to-day.  The dullards!  No one reasonable thing know they but the\r\nchase.  One had been at Florence; and when I asked him of the Baptistery\r\nand rare Giotto of whom my uncle told us, he asked if he were a knight of\r\nthe Medici.  All he knew was that there were ortolans at Ser Lorenzo\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntable; and he and the rest of them talked over wines as many and as hard\r\nto call as the roll of \xc3\x86neas\xe2\x80\x99s comrades; and when each one must drink to\r\nher he loved best, and I said I loved none like my sweet mother, they\r\ngibed me for a simple dutiful mountaineer.  Yea, and when the servants\r\nbrought a bowl, I thought it was a wholesome draught of spring water\r\nafter all their hot wines and fripperies.  Pah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rose-water, Ebbo!  No wonder they laughed!  Why, the bowls for our\r\nfingers came round at the banquet here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! thou hast eyes for their finikin manners!  Yet what know they of\r\nwhat we used to long for in polished life!  Not one but vowed he abhorred\r\nbooks, and cursed Dr. Faustus for multiplying them.  I may not know the\r\ntaste of a stew, nor the fit of a glove, as they do, but I trust I bear a\r\nless empty brain.  And the young Netherlanders that came with the\r\nArchduke were worst of all.  They got together and gabbled French, and\r\ntreated the German Junkern with the very same sauce with which they had\r\nserved me.  The Archduke laughed with them, and when the Provost\r\naddressed him, made as if he understood not, till his father heard, and\r\nthundered out, \xe2\x80\x98How now, Philip!  Deaf on thy German ear?  I tell thee,\r\nHerr Probst, he knows his own tongue as well as thou or I, and thou shalt\r\nhear him speak as becomes the son of an Austrian hunter.\xe2\x80\x99  That Romish\r\nking is a knight of knights, Friedel.  I could follow him to the world\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nend.  I wonder whether he will ever come to climb the Red Eyrie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does not seem the world\xe2\x80\x99s end when one is there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, with\r\nstrange yearnings in his breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven the Dom steeple never rose to its full height,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, standing\r\nin the window, and gazing pensively into the summer sky.  \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Ebbo! this\r\nknighthood has come very suddenly after our many dreams; and, even though\r\nits outward tokens be lowered, it is still a holy, awful thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNurtured in mountain solitude, on romance transmitted through the pure\r\nmedium of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and his spirit untainted by contact with the\r\nworld, Friedmund von Adlerstein looked on chivalry with the temper of a\r\nPercival or Galahad, and regarded it with a sacred awe.  Eberhard, though\r\ntreating it more as a matter of business, was like enough to his brother\r\nto enter into the force of the vows they were about to make; and if the\r\nyoung Barons of Adlerstein did not perform the night-watch over their\r\narmour, yet they kept a vigil that impressed their own minds as deeply,\r\nand in early morn they went to confession and mass ere the gay parts of\r\nthe city were astir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSweet niece,\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Sorel, as he saw the brothers\xe2\x80\x99 grave, earnest\r\nlooks, \xe2\x80\x9cthou hast done well by these youths; yet I doubt me at times\r\nwhether they be not too much lifted out of this veritable world of ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, fair uncle, were they not above it, how could they face its\r\ntemptations?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, my child; but how will it be when they find how lightly others\r\ntreat what to them is so solemn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere must be temptations for them, above all for Ebbo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut still, when I remember how my heart sank when their grandmother\r\ntried to bring them up to love crime as sport and glory, I cannot but\r\ntrust that the good work will be wrought out, and my dream fulfilled,\r\nthat they may be lights on earth and stars in heaven.  Even this matter\r\nof homage, that seemed so hard to my Ebbo, has now been made easy to him\r\nby his veneration for the Emperor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was even so.  If the sense that he was the last veritable _free_ lord\r\nof Adlerstein rushed over Ebbo, he was, on the other hand, overmastered\r\nby the kingliness of Friedrich and Maximilian, and was aware that this\r\nsubmission, while depriving him of little or no actual power, brought him\r\ninto relations with the civilized world, and opened to him paths of true\r\nhonour.  So the ceremonies were gone through, his oath of allegiance was\r\nmade, investiture was granted to him by the delivery of a sword, and both\r\nhe and Friedel were dubbed knights.  Then they shared another banquet,\r\nwhere, as away from the Junkern and among elder men, Ebbo was happier\r\nthan the day before.  Some of the knights seemed to him as rude and\r\nignorant as the Schneiderlein, but no one talked to him nor observed his\r\nmanners, and he could listen to conversation on war and policy such as\r\ninterested him far more than the subjects affected by youths a little\r\nolder than himself.  Their lonely life and training had rendered the\r\nminds of the brothers as much in advance of their fellows as they were\r\nbehind them in knowledge of the world.\r\n\r\nThe crass obtuseness of most of the nobility made it a relief to return\r\nto the usual habits of the Sorel household when the court had left Ulm.\r\nFriedmund, anxious to prove that his new honours were not to alter his\r\nhome demeanour, was drawing on a block of wood from a tinted pen-and-ink\r\nsketch; Ebbo was deeply engaged with a newly-acquired copy of Virgil; and\r\ntheir mother was embroidering some draperies for the long-neglected\r\ncastle chapel,\xe2\x80\x94all sitting, as Master Gottfried loved to have them, in\r\nhis studio, whence he had a few moments before been called away, when, as\r\nthe door slowly opened, a voice was heard that made both lads start and\r\nrise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea, truly, Herr Guildmaster, I would see these masterpieces.  Ha!  What\r\nhave you here for masterpieces?  Our two new double-ganger knights?\xe2\x80\x9d  And\r\nMaximilian entered in a simple riding-dress, attended by Master\r\nGottfried, and by Sir Kasimir of Adlerstein Wildschloss.\r\n\r\nChristina would fain have slipped out unperceived, but the king was\r\nalready removing his cap from his fair curling locks, and bending his\r\nhead as he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Frau Freiherrinn von Adlerstein?  Fair lady, I\r\ngreet you well, and thank you in the Kaisar\xe2\x80\x99s name and mine for having\r\nbred up for us two true and loyal subjects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay they so prove themselves, my liege!\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, bending low.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not only loyal-hearted,\xe2\x80\x9d added Maximilian, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nready-brained, which is less frequent among our youth.  What is thy book,\r\nyoung knight?  Virgilius Maro?  Dost thou read the Latin?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in\r\nthat tongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot as well as we wish, your kingly highness,\xe2\x80\x9d readily answered Ebbo, in\r\nLatin, \xe2\x80\x9chaving learnt solely of our mother till we came hither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever fear for that, my young blade,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the king.  \xe2\x80\x9cKnowst not\r\nthat the wiseacres thought me too dull for teaching till I was past ten\r\nyears?  And what is thy double about?  Drawing on wood?  How now!  An\r\nable draughtsman, my young knight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy nephew Sir Friedmund is good to the old man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gottfried, himself\r\nalmost regretting the lad\xe2\x80\x99s avocation.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy eyes are failing me, and he\r\nis aiding me with the graving of this border.  He has the knack that no\r\nteaching will impart to any of my present journeymen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBorn, not made,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Maximilian.  \xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d as Friedel coloured deeper at\r\nthe sense that Ebbo was ashamed of him, \xe2\x80\x9cno blushes, my boy; it is a rare\r\ngift.  I can make a hundred knights any day, but the Almighty alone can\r\nmake a genius.  It was this very matter of graving that led me hither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor Maximilian had a passion for composition, and chiefly for\r\nautobiography, and his head was full of that curious performance, _Der\r\nWeisse K\xc3\xb6nig_, which occupied many of the leisure moments of his life,\r\nbeing dictated to his former writing-master, Marcus Sauerwein.  He had\r\nalready designed the portrayal of his father as the old white king, and\r\nhimself as the young white king, in a series of woodcuts illustrating the\r\nnarrative which culminated in the one romance of his life, his brief\r\nhappy marriage with Mary of Burgundy; and he continued eagerly to talk to\r\nMaster Gottfried about the mystery of graving, and the various scenes in\r\nwhich he wished to depict himself learning languages from native\r\nspeakers\xe2\x80\x94Czech from a peasant with a basket of eggs, English from the\r\nexiles at the Burgundian court, who had also taught him the use of the\r\nlongbow, building from architects and masons, painting from artists, and,\r\nmore imaginatively, astrology from a wonderful flaming sphere in the sky,\r\nand the black art from a witch inspired by a long-tailed demon perched on\r\nher shoulder.  No doubt \xe2\x80\x9cthe young white king\xe2\x80\x9d made an exceedingly\r\nprominent figure in the discourse, but it was so quaint and so brilliant\r\nthat it did not need the charm of royal condescension to entrance the\r\nyoung knights, who stood silent auditors.  Ebbo at least was convinced\r\nthat no species of knowledge or skill was viewed by his kaisarly kingship\r\nas beneath his dignity; but still he feared Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s being seized upon\r\nto be as prime illustrator to the royal autobiography\xe2\x80\x94a lot to which,\r\nwith all his devotion to Maximilian, he could hardly have consigned his\r\nbrother, in the certainty that the jeers of the ruder nobles would pursue\r\nthe craftsman baron.\r\n\r\nHowever, for the present, Maximilian was keen enough to see that the\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s mechanical skill was not as yet equal to his genius; so he only\r\nencouraged him to practise, adding that he heard there was a rare lad,\r\none D\xc3\xbcrer, at Nuremburg, whose productions were already wonderful.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nwhat is this?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is the daintily-carved group I see\r\nyonder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour highness means, \xe2\x80\x98The Dove in the Eagle\xe2\x80\x99s Nest,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Kasimir.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis the work of my young kinsmen, and their appropriate device.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs well chosen as carved,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maximilian, examining it.  \xe2\x80\x9cWell is it\r\nthat a city dove should now and then find her way to the eyrie.  Some of\r\nmy nobles would cut my throat for the heresy, but I am safe here, eh, Sir\r\nKasimir?  Fare ye well, ye dove-trained eaglets.  We will know one\r\nanother better when we bear the cross against the infidel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe brothers kissed his hand, and he descended the steps from the hall\r\ndoor.  Ere he had gone far, he turned round upon Sir Kasimir with a merry\r\nsmile: \xe2\x80\x9cA very white and tender dove indeed, and one who might easily\r\nnestle in another eyrie, methinks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeems your kingly highness that consent could be won?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Wildschloss\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the Kaisar?  Pfui, man, thou knowst as well as I do the golden key\r\nto his consent.  So thou wouldst risk thy luck again!  Thou hast no male\r\nheir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I would fain give my child a mother who would deal well with her.\r\nNay, to say sooth, that gentle, innocent face has dwelt with me for many\r\nyears.  But for my pre-contract, I had striven long ago to win her, and\r\nhad been a happier man, mayhap.  And, now I have seen what she has made\r\nof her sons, I feel I could scarce find her match among our nobility.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor elsewhere,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king; \xe2\x80\x9cand I honour thee for not being so\r\nbesotted in our German haughtiness as not to see that it is our free\r\ncities that make refined and discreet dames.  I give you good speed,\r\nAdlerstein; but, if I read aright the brow of one at least of these young\r\nfellows, thou wilt scarce have a willing or obedient stepson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\nTHE RIVAL EYRIE\r\n\r\n\r\nEBBO trusted that his kinsman of Wildschloss was safe gone with the\r\nCourt, and his temper smoothed and his spirits rose in proportion while\r\npreparations for a return to Adlerstein were being completed\xe2\x80\x94preparations\r\nby which the burgher lady might hope to render the castle far more\r\nhabitable, not to say baronial, than it had ever been.\r\n\r\nThe lady herself felt thankful that her stay at Ulm had turned out well\r\nbeyond all anticipations in the excellent understanding between her uncle\r\nand her sons, and still more in Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s full submission and personal\r\nloyalty towards the imperial family.  The die was cast, and the first\r\nstep had been taken towards rendering the Adlerstein family the peaceful,\r\nhonourable nobles she had always longed to see them.\r\n\r\nShe was one afternoon assisting her aunt in some of the duties of her\r\nwirthschaft, when Master Gottfried entered the apartment with an air of\r\nsuch extreme complacency that both turned round amazed; the one\r\nexclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cSurely funds have come in for finishing the spire!\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nother, \xe2\x80\x9cHave they appointed thee Provost for next year, house-father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither the one nor the other,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut heard you not the\r\nhorse\xe2\x80\x99s feet?  Here has the Lord of Adlerstein Wildschloss been with me\r\nin full state, to make formal proposals for the hand of our child,\r\nChristina.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Christina!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hausfrau Johanna with delight; \xe2\x80\x9ctruly that is\r\nwell.  Truly our maiden has done honour to her breeding.  A second\r\nnobleman demanding her\xe2\x80\x94and one who should be able richly to endow her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who will do so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Gottfried.  \xe2\x80\x9cFor morning gift he\r\npromises the farms and lands of Gr\xc3\xbcnau\xe2\x80\x94rich both in forest and corn\r\nglebe.  Likewise, her dower shall be upon Wildschloss\xe2\x80\x94where the soil is\r\nof the richest pasture, and there are no less than three mills, whence\r\nthe lord obtains large rights of multure.  Moreover, the Castle was added\r\nto and furnished on his marriage with the late baroness, and might serve\r\na Kurf\xc3\xbcrst; and though the jewels of Freiherrinn Valeska must be\r\ninherited by her daughter, yet there are many of higher price which have\r\ndescended from his own ancestresses, and which will all be hers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what a wedding we will have!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Johanna; \xe2\x80\x9cit shall be truly\r\nbaronial.  I will take my hood and go at once to neighbour Sophie\r\nLemsberg, who was wife to the Markgraf\xe2\x80\x99s Under Keller-Meister.  She will\r\ntell me point device the ceremonies befitting the espousals of a baron\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwidow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Christina had sat all this time with drooping head and clasped\r\nhands, a tear stealing down as the formal terms of the treaty sent her\r\nspirit back to the urgent, pleading, imperious voice that had said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\r\nlittle one, thou wilt not shut me out;\xe2\x80\x9d and as she glanced at the ring\r\nthat had lain on that broad palm, she felt as if her sixteen cheerful\r\nyears had been an injury to her husband in his nameless bloody grave.\r\nBut protection was so needful in those rude ages, and second marriages so\r\nfrequent, that reluctance was counted as weakness.  She knew her uncle\r\nand aunt would never believe that aught but compulsion had bound her to\r\nthe rude outlaw, and her habit of submission was so strong that, only\r\nwhen her aunt was actually rising to go and consult her gossip, she found\r\nbreath to falter,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold, dear aunt\xe2\x80\x94my sons\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, child, it is the best thing thou couldst do for them.  Wonders hast\r\nthou wrought, yet are they too old to be without fatherly authority.  I\r\nspeak not of Friedel; the lad is gentle and pious, though spirited, but\r\nfor the baron.  The very eye and temper of my poor brother Hugh\xe2\x80\x94thy\r\nfather, Stine\xe2\x80\x94are alive again in him.  Yea, I love the lad the better for\r\nit, while I fear.  He minds me precisely of Hugh ere he was \xe2\x80\x99prenticed to\r\nthe weapon-smith, and all became bitterness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, truly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, raising her eyes \xe2\x80\x9call would become\r\nbitterness with my Ebbo were I to give a father\xe2\x80\x99s power to one whom he\r\nwould not love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen were he sullen and unruly, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old burgomaster with\r\ndispleasure; \xe2\x80\x9cnone have shown him more kindness, none could better aid\r\nhim in court and empire.  The lad has never had restraint enough.  I\r\nblame thee not, child, but he needs it sorely, by thine own showing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, uncle! mine be the blame, but it is over late.  My boy will rule\r\nhimself for the love of God and of his mother, but he will brook no hand\r\nover him\xe2\x80\x94least of all now he is a knight and thinks himself a man.\r\nUncle, I should be deprived of both my sons, for Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s very soul is\r\nbound up with his brother\xe2\x80\x99s.  I pray thee enjoin not this thing on me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe implored.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChild!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Master Gottfried, \xe2\x80\x9cthou thinkst not that such a\r\ncontract as this can be declined for the sake of a wayward Junker!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay, house-father, the little one will doubtless hear reason and\r\nsubmit,\xe2\x80\x9d put in the aunt.  \xe2\x80\x9cHer sons were goodly and delightsome to her\r\nin their upgrowth, but they are well-nigh men.  They will be away to\r\ncourt and camp, to love and marriage; and how will it be with her then,\r\nyoung and fair as she still is?  Well will it be for her to have a\r\nstately lord of her own, and a new home of love and honour springing\r\nround her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Sorel; \xe2\x80\x9cand though she be too pious and wise to reck\r\ngreatly of such trifles, yet it may please her dreamy brain to hear that\r\nSir Kasimir loves her even like a paladin, and the love of a tried man of\r\nsix-and-forty is better worth than a mere kindling of youthful fancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine Eberhard loved me!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Christina, almost to herself, but her\r\naunt caught the word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what was such love worth?  To force thee into a stolen match, and\r\nleave thee alone and unowned to the consequences!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Christina, with crimson cheek and uplifted head.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace!  My own dear lord loved me with true and generous love!  None but\r\nmyself knows how much.  Not a word will I hear against that tender\r\nheart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, peace,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Gottfried in a conciliatory tone,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cpeace to the\r\nbrave Sir Eberhard.  Thine aunt meant no ill of him.  He truly would\r\nrejoice that the wisdom of his choice should receive such testimony, and\r\nthat his sons should be thus well handled.  Nay, little as I heed such\r\ntoys, it will doubtless please the lads that the baron will obtain of the\r\nEmperor letters of nobility for this house, which verily sprang of a good\r\nWalloon family, and so their shield will have no blank.  The Romish king\r\npromises to give thee rank with any baroness, and hath fully owned what a\r\npearl thou art, mine own sweet dove!  Nay, Sir Kasimir is coming\r\nto-morrow in the trust to make the first betrothal with Graf von Kaulwitz\r\nas a witness, and I thought of asking the Provost on the other hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Johanna; \xe2\x80\x9cand how is she to be meetly clad?  Look\r\nat this widow-garb; and how is time to be found for procuring other\r\nraiment?  House-father, a substantial man like you should better\r\nunderstand!  The meal too!  I must to gossip Sophie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVerily, dear mother and father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, who had rallied a\r\nlittle, \xe2\x80\x9chave patience with me.  I may not lightly or suddenly betroth\r\nmyself; I know not that I can do so at all, assuredly not unless my sons\r\nwere heartily willing.  Have I your leave to retire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGranted, my child, for meditation will show thee that this is too fair a\r\nlot for any but thee.  Much had I longed to see thee wedded ere thy sons\r\noutgrew thy care, but I shunned proposing even one of our worthy\r\nguildmasters, lest my young Freiherr should take offence; but this\r\nknight, of his own blood, true and wise as a burgher, and faithful and\r\nGod-fearing withal, is a better match than I durst hope, and is no doubt\r\na special reward from thy patron saint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me entreat one favour more,\xe2\x80\x9d implored Christina.  \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak of this to\r\nno one ere I have seen my sons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made her way to her own chamber, there to weep and flutter.  Marriage\r\nwas a matter of such high contract between families that the parties\r\nthemselves had usually no voice in the matter, and only the widowed had\r\nany chance of a personal choice; nor was this always accorded in the case\r\nof females, who remained at the disposal of their relatives.  Good\r\nsubstantial wedded affection was not lacking, but romantic love was\r\nthought an unnecessary preliminary, and found a vent in extravagant\r\nadoration, not always in reputable quarters.  Obedience first to the\r\nfather, then to the husband, was the first requisite; love might shift\r\nfor itself; and the fair widow of Adlerstein, telling her beads in sheer\r\nperplexity, knew not whether her strong repugnance to this marriage and\r\nwarm sympathy with her son Ebbo were not an act of rebellion.  Yet each\r\nmoment did her husband rise before her mind more vividly, with his rugged\r\nlooks, his warm, tender heart, his dawnings of comprehension, his\r\ngenerous forbearance and reverential love\xe2\x80\x94the love of her youth\xe2\x80\x94to be\r\nequalled by no other.  The accomplished courtier and polished man of the\r\nworld might be his superior, but she loathed the superiority, since it\r\nwas to her husband.  Might not his one chosen dove keep heart-whole for\r\nhim to the last?  She recollected that coarsest, cruellest reproach of\r\nall that her mother-in-law had been wont to fling at her,\xe2\x80\x94that she, the\r\nrecent widow, the new-made mother of Eberhard\xe2\x80\x99s babes, in her grief, her\r\nterror, and her weakness had sought to captivate this suitor by her\r\nblandishments.  The taunt seemed justified, and her cheeks burned with\r\nabsolute shame \xe2\x80\x9cMy husband! my loving Eberhard! left with none but me to\r\nlove thee, unknown to thine own sons!  I cannot, I will not give my heart\r\naway from thee!  Thy little bride shall be faithful to thee, whatever\r\nbetide.  When we meet beyond the grave I will have been thine only, nor\r\nhave set any before thy sons.  Heaven forgive me if I be undutiful to my\r\nuncle; but thou must be preferred before even him!  Hark!\xe2\x80\x9d and she\r\nstarted as if at Eberhard\xe2\x80\x99s foot-step; then smiled, recollecting that\r\nEbbo had his father\xe2\x80\x99s tread.  But her husband had been too much in awe of\r\nher to enter with that hasty agitated step and exclamation, \xe2\x80\x9cMother,\r\nmother, what insolence is this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, Ebbo!  I prayed mine uncle to let me speak to thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, dashing his cap on the ground; \xe2\x80\x9cI had\r\nsoundly beaten that grinning \xe2\x80\x99prentice for telling Heinz.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly the house rings with the rumour, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we\r\nhad not believed it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believed Wildschloss assured enough for aught,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\nthought he knew where to begin.  Does he not know who is head of the\r\nhouse of Adlerstein, since he must tamper with a mechanical craftsman,\r\ncap in hand to any sprig of nobility!  I would have soon silenced his\r\novertures!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it in sooth as we heard?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Friedel, blushing to the ears, for\r\nthe boy was shy as a maiden.  \xe2\x80\x9cMother, we know what you would say,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, throwing himself on his knees beside her, his arm round her waist,\r\nhis cheek on her lap, and his eyes raised to hers.\r\n\r\nShe bent down to kiss him.  \xe2\x80\x9cThou knewst it, Friedel, and now must thou\r\naid me to remain thy father\xe2\x80\x99s true widow, and to keep Ebbo from being\r\nviolent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEbbo checked his hasty march to put his hand on her chair and kiss her\r\nbrow.  \xe2\x80\x9cMotherling, I will restrain myself, so you will give me your word\r\nnot to desert us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Ebbo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, \xe2\x80\x9cthe motherling is too true and loving for us\r\nto bind her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChildren,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9chear me patiently.  I have been communing with\r\nmyself, and deeply do I feel that none other can I love save him who is\r\nto you a mere name, but to me a living presence.  Nor would I put any\r\nbetween you and me.  Fear me not, Ebbo.  I think the mothers and sons of\r\nthis wider, fuller world do not prize one another as we do.  But, my son,\r\nthis is no matter for rage or ingratitude.  Remember it is no small\r\ncondescension in a noble to stoop to thy citizen mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knew what painted puppets noble ladies are,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Ebbo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoreover,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Christina, \xe2\x80\x9cthine uncle is highly gratified, and\r\ncannot believe that I can refuse.  He understands not my love for thy\r\nfather, and sees many advantages for us all.  I doubt me if he believes I\r\nhave power to resist his will, and for thee, he would not count thine\r\nopposition valid.  And the more angry and vehement thou art, the more\r\nwill he deem himself doing thee a service by overruling thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome home, mother.  Let Heinz lead our horses to the door in the dawn,\r\nand when we are back in free Adlerstein it will be plain who is master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a flitting would scarce prove our wisdom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, \xe2\x80\x9cto run\r\naway with thy mother like a lover in a ballad.  Nay, let me first deal\r\ngently with thine uncle, and speak myself with Sir Kasimir, so that I may\r\nshow him the vanity of his suit.  Then will we back to Adlerstein without\r\nleaving wounds to requite kindness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEbbo was wrought on to promise not to attack the burgomaster on the\r\nsubject, but he was moody and silent, and Master Gottfried let him alone,\r\nconsidering his gloom as another proof of his need of fatherly authority,\r\nand as a peace-lover forbearing to provoke his fiery spirit.\r\n\r\nBut when Sir Kasimir\xe2\x80\x99s visit was imminent, and Christina had refused to\r\nmake the change in her dress by which a young widow was considered to lay\r\nherself open to another courtship, Master Gottfried called the twins\r\napart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy young lords,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI fear me ye are vexing your gentle mother by\r\nneedless strife at what must take place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, good uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9cI utterly decline the honour of Sir\r\nKasimir\xe2\x80\x99s suit to my mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaster Gottfried smiled.  \xe2\x80\x9cSons are not wont to be the judges in such\r\ncases, Sir Eberhard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered; \xe2\x80\x9cbut my mother\xe2\x80\x99s will is to the nayward, nor\r\nshall she be coerced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is merely because of you and your pride,\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Gottfried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think not so,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the calmer Friedel; \xe2\x80\x9cmy mother\xe2\x80\x99s love for my\r\nfather is still fresh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung knights,\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Gottfried, \xe2\x80\x9cit would scarce become me to\r\nsay, nor you to hear, how much matter of fancy such love must have been\r\ntowards one whom she knew but for a few short months, though her pure\r\nsweet dreams, through these long years, have moulded him into a hero.\r\nBoys, I verily believe ye love her truly.  Would it be well for her still\r\nto mourn and cherish a dream while yet in her fresh age, capable of new\r\nhappiness, fuller than she has ever enjoyed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is happy with us,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Ebbo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd ye are good lads and loving sons, though less duteous in manner than\r\nI could wish.  But look you, you may not ever be with her, and when ye\r\nare absent in camp or court, or contracting a wedlock of your own, would\r\nyou leave her to her lonesome life in your solitary castle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFriedel\xe2\x80\x99s unselfishness might have been startled, but Ebbo boldly\r\nanswered, \xe2\x80\x9cAll mine is hers.  No joy to me but shall be a joy to her.  We\r\ncan make her happier than could any stranger.  Is it not so, Friedel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, rash bloods, promising beyond what ye can keep.  Nature will be too\r\nstrong for you.  Love your mother as ye may, what will she be to you when\r\na bride comes in your way?  Fling not away in wrath, Sir Baron; it was so\r\nwith your parents both before you; and what said the law of the good God\r\nat the first marriage?  How can you withstand the nature He has given?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelike I may wed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, bluntly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if it be not for my mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhappiness, call me man-sworn knight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so,\xe2\x80\x9d good-humouredly answered Gottfried, \xe2\x80\x9cbut boy-sworn paladin, who\r\ntalks of he knows not what.  Speak knightly truth, Sir Baron, and own\r\nthat this opposition is in verity from distaste to a stepfather\xe2\x80\x99s rule.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI own that I will not brook such rule,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo; \xe2\x80\x9cnor do I know what\r\nwe have done to deserve that it should be thrust on us.  You have never\r\nblamed Friedel, at least; and verily, uncle, my mother\xe2\x80\x99s eye will lead me\r\nwhere a stranger\xe2\x80\x99s hand shall never drive me.  Did I even think she had\r\nfor this man a quarter of the love she bears to my dead father, I would\r\nstrive for endurance; but in good sooth we found her in tears, praying us\r\nto guard her from him.  I may be a boy, but I am man enough to prevent\r\nher from being coerced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas this so, Friedel?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Master Gottfried, moved more than by all\r\nthat had gone before.  \xe2\x80\x9cAch, I thought ye all wiser.  And spake she not\r\nof Sir Kasimir\xe2\x80\x99s offers?\xe2\x80\x94Interest with the Romish king?\xe2\x80\x94Yea, and a grant\r\nof nobility and arms to this house, so as to fill the blank in your\r\nscutcheon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father never asked if she were noble,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cNor will I barter\r\nher for a cantle of a shield.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere spake a manly spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d said his uncle, delighted.  \xe2\x80\x9cHer worth hath\r\ntaught thee how little to prize these gewgaws!  Yet, if you look to\r\nmingling with your own proud kind, ye may fall among greater slights than\r\nye can brook.  It may matter less to you, Sir Baron, but Friedel here,\r\nay, and your sons, will be ineligible to the choicest orders of\r\nknighthood, and the canonries and chapters that are honourable\r\nendowments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFriedel looked as if he could bear it, and Eberhard said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe order of\r\nthe Dove of Adlerstein is enough for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeadstrong all, headstrong all,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Master Gottfried.  \xe2\x80\x9cOne romantic\r\nmarriage has turned all your heads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Baron of Adlerstein Wildschloss, unprepared for the opposition that\r\nawaited him, was riding down the street equipped point device, and with a\r\ngoodly train of followers, in brilliant suits.  Private wooing did not\r\nenter into the honest ideas of the burghers, and the suitor was ushered\r\ninto the full family assembly, where Christina rose and came forward a\r\nfew steps to meet him, curtseying as low as he bowed, as he said, \xe2\x80\x9cLady,\r\nI have preferred my suit to you through your honour-worthy uncle, who is\r\ngood enough to stand my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are over good, sir.  I feel the honour, but a second wedlock may not\r\nbe mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Ebbo to his brother, as the knight and lady seated\r\nthemselves in full view, \xe2\x80\x9cnow will the smooth-tongued fellow talk her out\r\nof her senses.  Alack! that gipsy prophecy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWildschloss did not talk like a young wooer; such days were over for\r\nboth; but he spoke as a grave and honourable man, deeply penetrated with\r\ntrue esteem and affection.  He said that at their first meeting he had\r\nbeen struck with her sweetness and discretion, and would soon after have\r\nendeavoured to release her from her durance, but that he was bound by the\r\ncontract already made with the Trautbachs, who were dangerous neighbours\r\nto Wildschloss.  He had delayed his distasteful marriage as long as\r\npossible, and it had caused him nothing but trouble and strife; his\r\nchildren would not live, and Thekla, the only survivor, was, as his sole\r\nheiress, a mark for the cupidity of her uncle, the Count of Trautbach,\r\nand his almost savage son Lassla; while the right to the Wildschloss\r\nbarony would become so doubtful between her and Ebbo, as heir of the male\r\nline, that strife and bloodshed would be well-nigh inevitable.  These\r\ncauses made it almost imperative that he should re-marry, and his own\r\nstrong preference and regard for little Thekla directed his wishes\r\ntowards the Freiherrinn von Adlerstein.  He backed his suit with courtly\r\ncompliments, as well as with representations of his child\xe2\x80\x99s need of a\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s training, and the twins\xe2\x80\x99 equal want of fatherly guidance,\r\ndilating on the benefits he could confer on them.\r\n\r\nChristina felt his kindness, and had full trust in his intentions.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwas a difficult syllable to her, but she had that within her which could\r\nnot accept him; and she firmly told him that she was too much bound to\r\nboth her Eberhards.  But there was no daunting him, nor preventing her\r\nuncle and aunt from encouraging him.  He professed that he would wait,\r\nand give her time to consider; and though she reiterated that\r\nconsideration would not change her mind, Master Gottfried came forward to\r\nthank him, and express his confidence of bringing her to reason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile I, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, with flashing eyes, and low but resentful\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cbeg to decline the honour in the name of the elder house of\r\nAdlerstein.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe held himself upright as a dart, but was infinitely annoyed by the\r\nlittle mocking bow and smile that he received in return, as Sir Kasimir,\r\nwith his long mantle, swept out of the apartment, attended by Master\r\nGottfried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBurgomaster Sorel,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, standing in the middle of the floor as\r\nhis uncle returned, \xe2\x80\x9clet me hear whether I am a person of any\r\nconsideration in this family or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNephew baron,\xe2\x80\x9d quietly replied Master Gottfried, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not the use of\r\nus Germans to be dictated to by youths not yet arrived at years of\r\ndiscretion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9cwe leave this place to-morrow morn.\xe2\x80\x9d  And at\r\nher nod of assent the house-father looked deeply grieved, the\r\nhouse-mother began to clamour about ingratitude.  \xe2\x80\x9cNot so,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nEbbo, fiercely.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe quit the house as poor as we came, in homespun and\r\nwith the old mare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace, Ebbo!\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother, rising; \xe2\x80\x9cpeace, I entreat, house-mother!\r\npardon, uncle, I pray thee.  O, why will not all who love me let me\r\nfollow that which I believe to be best!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChild,\xe2\x80\x9d said her uncle, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot see thee domineered over by a youth\r\nwhose whole conduct shows his need of restraint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor am I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is I who am utterly averse to this\r\noffer.  My sons and I are one in that; and, uncle, if I pray of you to\r\nconsent to let us return to our castle, it is that I would not see the\r\nvisit that has made us so happy stained with strife and dissension!\r\nSure, sure, you cannot be angered with my son for his love for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the self-seeking of his love,\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Gottfried.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is to\r\ngratify his own pride that he first would prevent thee from being\r\nenriched and ennobled, and now would bear thee away to the scant\xe2\x80\x94Nay,\r\nFreiherr, I will not seem to insult you, but resentment would make you\r\ncruel to your mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot cruel!\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, hastily.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy mother is willing.  And verily,\r\ngood uncle, methinks that we all were best at home.  We have benefited\r\nmuch and greatly by our stay; we have learnt to love and reverence you;\r\nbut we are wild mountaineers at the best; and, while our hearts are\r\nfretted by the fear of losing our sweet mother, we can scarce be as\r\npatient or submissive as if we had been bred up by a stern father.  We\r\nhave ever judged and acted for ourselves, and it is hard to us not to do\r\nso still, when our minds are chafed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriedel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, sternly, \xe2\x80\x9cI will have no pardon asked for\r\nmaintaining my mother\xe2\x80\x99s cause.  Do not thou learn to be smooth-tongued.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO thou wrong-headed boy!\xe2\x80\x9d half groaned Master Gottfried.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did not\r\nall this fall out ten years sooner, when thou wouldst have been amenable?\r\nYet, after all, I do not know that any noble training has produced a more\r\nhigh-minded loving youth,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, half relenting as he looked at the\r\ngallant, earnest face, full of defiance indeed, but with a certain\r\nwistful appealing glance at \xe2\x80\x9cthe motherling,\xe2\x80\x9d softening the liquid\r\nlustrous dark eye.  \xe2\x80\x9cGet thee gone, boy, I would not quarrel with you;\r\nand it may be, as Friedel says, that we are best out of one another\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nway.  You are used to lord it, and I can scarce make excuses for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, scarce appeased, \xe2\x80\x9cI take home my mother, and you, sir,\r\ncease to favour Kasimir\xe2\x80\x99s suit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sir Baron.  I cease not to think that nothing would be so much for\r\nyour good.  It is because I believe that a return to your own old castle\r\nwill best convince you all that I will not vex your mother by further\r\nopposing your departure.  When you perceive your error may it only not be\r\ntoo late!  Such a protector is not to be found every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother shall never need any protector save myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo; \xe2\x80\x9cbut,\r\nsir, she loves you, and owes all to you.  Therefore I will not be at\r\nstrife with you, and there is my hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said it as if he had been the Emperor reconciling himself to all the\r\nHanse towns in one.  Master Gottfried could scarce refrain from shrugging\r\nhis shoulders, and Hausfrau Johanna was exceedingly angry with the\r\npetulant pride and insolence of the young noble; but, in effect, all were\r\ntoo much relieved to avoid an absolute quarrel with the fiery lad to take\r\nexception at minor matters.  The old burgher was forbearing; Christina,\r\nwho knew how much her son must have swallowed to bring him to this\r\nconcession for love of her, thought him a hero worthy of all sacrifices;\r\nand peace-making Friedel, by his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s side, soon softened even her, by\r\nsome of the persuasive arguments that old dames love from gracious,\r\ngraceful, great-nephews.\r\n\r\nAnd when, by and by, Master Gottfried went out to call on Sir Kasimir,\r\nand explain how he had thought it best to yield to the hot-tempered lad,\r\nand let the family learn how to be thankful for the goods they had\r\nrejected, he found affairs in a state that made him doubly anxious that\r\nthe young barons should be safe on their mountain without knowing of\r\nthem.  The Trautbach family had heard of Wildschloss\xe2\x80\x99s designs, and they\r\nhad set abroad such injurious reports respecting the Lady of Adlerstein,\r\nthat Sir Kasimir was in the act of inditing a cartel to be sent by Count\r\nKaulwitz, to demand an explanation\xe2\x80\x94not merely as the lady\xe2\x80\x99s suitor, but\r\nas the only Adlerstein of full age.  Now, if Ebbo had heard of the\r\nrumour, he would certainly have given the lie direct, and taken the whole\r\ndefence on himself; and it may be feared that, just as his cause might\r\nhave been, Master Gottfried\xe2\x80\x99s faith did not stretch to believing that it\r\nwould make his sixteen-year-old arm equal to the brutal might of Lassla\r\nof Trautbach.  So he heartily thanked the Baron of Wildschloss, agreed\r\nwith him that the young knights were not as yet equal to the maintenance\r\nof the cause, and went home again to watch carefully that no report\r\nreached either of his nephews.  Nor did he breathe freely till he had\r\nseen the little party ride safe off in the early morning, in much more\r\nlordly guise than when they had entered the city.\r\n\r\nAs to Wildschloss and his nephew of Trautbach, in spite of their\r\nrelationship they had a sharp combat on the borders of their own estates,\r\nin which both were severely wounded; but Sir Kasimir, with the\r\nmisericorde in his grasp, forced Lassla to retract whatever he had said\r\nin dispraise of the Lady of Adlerstein.  Wily old Gottfried took care\r\nthat the tidings should be sent in a form that might at once move\r\nChristina with pity and gratitude towards her champion, and convince her\r\nsons that the adversary was too much hurt for them to attempt a fresh\r\nchallenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\nTHE EAGLE AND THE SNAKE\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE reconciliation made Ebbo retract his hasty resolution of\r\nrelinquishing all the benefits resulting from his connection with the\r\nSorel family, and his mother\xe2\x80\x99s fortune made it possible to carry out many\r\nchanges that rendered the castle and its inmates far more prosperous in\r\nappearance than had ever been the case before.  Christina had once again\r\nthe appliances of a _wirthschaft_, such as she felt to be the suitable\r\nand becoming appurtenance of a right-minded Frau, gentle or simple, and\r\nshe felt so much the happier and more respectable.\r\n\r\nA chaplain had also been secured.  The youths had insisted on his being\r\ncapable of assisting their studies, and, a good man had been found who\r\nwas fearfully learned, having studied at all possible universities, but\r\nthen failing as a teacher, because he was so dreamy and absent as to be\r\nincapable of keeping the unruly students in order.  Jobst Sch\xc3\xb6n was his\r\nproper name, but he was translated into Jodocus Pulcher.  The chapel was\r\nduly adorned, the hall and other chambers were fitted up with some degree\r\nof comfort; the castle court was cleansed, the cattle sheds removed to\r\nthe rear, and the serfs were presented with seed, and offered payment in\r\ncoin if they would give their labour in fencing and clearing the\r\ncornfield and vineyard which the barons were bent on forming on the sunny\r\nslope of the ravine.  Poverty was over, thanks to the marriage portion,\r\nand yet Ebbo looked less happy than in the days when there was but a bare\r\nsubsistence; and he seemed to miss the full tide of city life more than\r\ndid his brother, who, though he had enjoyed Ulm more heartily at the\r\ntime, seemed to have returned to all his mountain delights with greater\r\nzest than ever.  At his favourite tarn, he revelled in the vast stillness\r\nwith the greater awe for having heard the hum of men, and his minstrel\r\ndreams had derived fresh vigour from contact with the active world.  But,\r\nas usual, he was his brother\xe2\x80\x99s chief stay in the vexations of a reformer.\r\nThe serfs had much rather their lord had turned out a freebooter than an\r\nimprover.  Why should they sow new seeds, when the old had sufficed their\r\nfathers?  Work, beyond the regulated days when they scratched up the soil\r\nof his old enclosure, was abhorrent to them.  As to his offered coin,\r\nthey needed nothing it would buy, and had rather bask in the sun or sleep\r\nin the smoke.  A vineyard had never been heard of on Adlerstein mountain:\r\nit was clean contrary to his forefathers\xe2\x80\x99 habits; and all came of the bad\r\ndrop of restless burgher blood, that could not let honest folk rest.\r\n\r\nEbbo stormed, not merely with words, but blows, became ashamed of his\r\nviolence, tried to atone for it by gifts and kind words, and in return\r\nwas sulkily told that he would bring more good to the village by rolling\r\nthe fiery wheel straight down hill at the wake, than by all his\r\nnew-fangled ways.  Had not Koppel and a few younger men been more open to\r\ninfluence, his agricultural schemes could hardly have begun; but\r\nFriedel\xe2\x80\x99s persuasions were not absolutely without success, and every rood\r\nthat was dug was achieved by his patience and perseverance.\r\n\r\nNext came home the Graf von Schlangenwald.  He had of late inhabited his\r\ncastle in Styria, but in a fierce quarrel with some of his neighbours he\r\nhad lost his eldest son, and the pacification enforced by the King of the\r\nRomans had so galled and infuriated him that he had deserted that part of\r\nthe country and returned to Swabia more fierce and bitter than ever.\r\nThenceforth began a petty border warfare such as had existed when\r\nChristina first knew Adlerstein, but had of late died out.  The shepherd\r\nlad came home weeping with wrath.  Three mounted Schlangenwaldern had\r\ndriven off his four best sheep, and beaten himself with their halberds,\r\nthough he was safe on Adlerstein ground.  Then a light thrown by a\r\nSchlangenwald reiter consumed all Jobst\xe2\x80\x99s pile of wood.  The swine did\r\nnot come home, and were found with spears sticking in them; the great\r\nbroad-horned bull that Ebbo had brought from the pastures of Ulm vanished\r\nfrom the Alp below the Gemsbock\xe2\x80\x99s Pass, and was known to be salted for\r\nwinter use at Schlangenwald.\r\n\r\nStill Christina tried to persuade her sons that this might be only the\r\nretainers\xe2\x80\x99 violence, and induced Ebbo to write a letter, complaining of\r\nthe outrages, but not blaming the Count, only begging that his followers\r\nmight be better restrained.  The letter was conveyed by a lay brother\xe2\x80\x94no\r\nother messenger being safe.  Ebbo had protested from the first that it\r\nwould be of no use, but he waited anxiously for the answer.\r\n\r\nThus it stood, when conveyed to him by a tenant of the Ruprecht\r\ncloister:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cWot you, Eberhard, Freiherr von Adlerstein, that your house have\r\n    injured me by thought, word, and deed.  Your great-grandfather\r\n    usurped my lands at the ford.  Your grandfather stole my cattle and\r\n    burnt my mills.  Then, in the war, he slew my brother Johann and\r\n    lamed for life my cousin Matthias.  Your father slew eight of my\r\n    retainers and spoiled my crops.  You yourself claim my land at the\r\n    ford, and secure the spoil which is justly mine.  Therefore do I\r\n    declare war and feud against you.  Therefore to you and all yours, to\r\n    your helpers and helpers\xe2\x80\x99 helpers, am I a foe.  And thereby shall I\r\n    have maintained my honour against you and yours.\r\n\r\n                                         WOLFGANG, Graf von Schlangenwald.\r\n                               HIEROM, Graf von Schlangenwald\xe2\x80\x94his cousin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                                                               &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\nAnd a long list of names, all connected with Schlangenwald, followed; and\r\na large seal, bearing the snake of Schlangenwald, was appended thereto.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old miscreant!\xe2\x80\x9d burst out Ebbo; \xe2\x80\x9cit is a feud brief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA feud brief!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Friedel; \xe2\x80\x9cthey are no longer according to the\r\nlaw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaw?\xe2\x80\x94what cares he for law or mercy either?  Is this the way men act by\r\nthe League?  Did we not swear to send no more feud letters, nor have\r\nrecourse to fist-right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must appeal to the Markgraf of Wurtemburg,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel.\r\n\r\nIt was the only measure in their power, though Ebbo winced at it; but his\r\noaths were recent, and his conscience would not allow him to transgress\r\nthem by doing himself justice.  Besides, neither party could take the\r\ncastle of the other, and the only reprisals in his power would have been\r\non the defenceless peasants of Schlangenwald.  He must therefore lay the\r\nwhole matter before the Markgraf, who was the head of the Swabian League,\r\nand bound to redress his wrongs.  He made his arrangements without\r\nfaltering, selecting the escort who were to accompany him, and insisting\r\non leaving Friedel to guard his mother and the castle.  He would not for\r\nthe world have admitted the suggestion that the counsel and introduction\r\nof Adlerstein Wildschloss would have been exceedingly useful to him.\r\n\r\nPoor Christina!  It was a great deal too like that former departure, and\r\nher heart was heavy within her!  Friedel was equally unhappy at letting\r\nhis brother go without him, but it was quite necessary that he and the\r\nfew armed men who remained should show themselves at all points open to\r\nthe enemy in the course of the day, lest the Freiherr\xe2\x80\x99s absence should be\r\nremarked.  He did his best to cheer his mother, by reminding her that\r\nEbbo was not likely to be taken at unawares as their father had been; and\r\nhe shared the prayers and chapel services, in which she poured out her\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nThe blue banner came safe up the Pass again, but Wurtemburg had been\r\nformally civil to the young Freiherr; but he had laughed at the fend\r\nletter as a mere old-fashioned habit of Schangenwald\xe2\x80\x99s that it was better\r\nnot to notice, and he evidently regarded the stealing of a bull or the\r\nmisusing of a serf as far too petty a matter for his attention.  It was\r\nas if a judge had been called by a crying child to settle a nursery\r\nquarrel.  He told Ebbo that, being a free Baron of the empire, he must\r\nkeep his bounds respected; he was free to take and hang any spoiler he\r\ncould catch, but his bulls were his own affair: the League was not for\r\nsuch gear.\r\n\r\nAnd a knight who had ridden out of Stuttgard with Ebbo had told him that\r\nit was no wonder that this had been his reception, for not only was\r\nSchlangenwald an old intimate of the Markgraf, but Swabia was claimed as\r\na fief of Wurtemburg, so that Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s direct homage to the Emperor,\r\nwithout the interposition of the Markgraf, had made him no object of\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat could be done?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ebbo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFire some Schlangenwald hamlet, and teach him to respect yours,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe knight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor serfs are guiltless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha! as if they would not rob any of yours.  Give and take, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe way the empire wags, Sir Baron.  Send him a feud letter in return,\r\nwith a goodly file of names at its foot, and teach him to respect you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have sworn to abstain from fist-right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch you gain by so abstaining.  If the League will not take the trouble\r\nto right you, right yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall appeal to the Emperor, and tell him how his League is\r\nadministered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung sir, if the Emperor were to guard every cow in his domains he\r\nwould have enough to do.  You will never prosper with him without some\r\none to back your cause better than that free tongue of yours.  Hast no\r\nsister that thou couldst give in marriage to a stout baron that could aid\r\nyou with strong arm and prudent head?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have only one twin brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! the twins of Adlerstein!  I remember me.  Was not the other\r\nAdlerstein seeking an alliance with your lady mother?  Sure no better aid\r\ncould be found.  He is hand and glove with young King Max.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may never be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, haughtily.  And, sure that he should\r\nreceive the same advice, he decided against turning aside to consult his\r\nuncle at Ulm, and returned home in a mood that rejoiced Heinz and Hatto\r\nwith hopes of the old days, while it filled his mother with dreary dismay\r\nand apprehension.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSchlangenwald should suffer next time he transgressed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nshould not again be said that he himself was a coward who appealed to the\r\nlaw because his hand could not keep his head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cnext time\xe2\x80\x9d was when the first winter cold was setting in.  A party\r\nof reitern came to harry an outlying field, where Ulrich had raised a\r\nscanty crop of rye.  Tidings reached the castle in such good time that\r\nthe two brothers, with Heinz, the two Ulm grooms, Koppel, and a troop of\r\nserfs, fell on the marauders before they had effected much damage, and\r\nwhile some remained to trample out the fire, the rest pursued the enemy\r\neven to the village of Schlangenwald.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBurn it, Herr Freiherr,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Heinz, hot with victory.  \xe2\x80\x9cLet them learn\r\nhow to make havoc of our corn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut a host of half-naked beings rushed out shrieking about sick children,\r\nbed-ridden grandmothers, and crippled fathers, and falling on their\r\nknees, with their hands stretched out to the young barons.  Ebbo turned\r\naway his head with hot tears in his eyes.  \xe2\x80\x9cFriedel, what can we do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot barbarous murder,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they brand us for cowards!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cowardice were in striking here,\xe2\x80\x9d and Friedel sprang to withhold\r\nKoppel, who had lighted a bundle of dried fern ready to thrust into the\r\nthatch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeasants!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, with the same impulse, \xe2\x80\x9cI spare you.  You did not\r\nthis wrong.  But bear word to your lord, that if he will meet me with\r\nlance and sword, he will learn the valour of Adlerstein.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe serfs flung themselves before him in transports of gratitude, but he\r\nturned hastily away and strode up the mountain, his cheek glowing as he\r\nremembered, too late, that his defiance would be scoffed at, as a boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvaunt.  By and by he arrived at the hamlet, where he found a prisoner, a\r\nscowling, abject fellow, already well beaten, and now held by two serfs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe halter is ready, Herr Freiherr,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Ulrich, \xe2\x80\x9cand yon rowan\r\nstump is still as stout as when your Herr grandsire hung three\r\nlanzknechts on it in one day.  We only waited your bidding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick then, and let me hear no more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, about to descend the\r\npass, as if hastening from the execution of a wolf taken in a gin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he seen the priest?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Friedel.\r\n\r\nThe peasants looked as if this were one of Sir Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s unaccountable\r\nfancies.  Ebbo paused, frowned, and muttered, but seeing a move as if to\r\ndrag the wretch towards the stunted bush overhanging an abyss, he\r\nshouted, \xe2\x80\x9cHold, Ulrich!  Little Hans, do thou run down to the castle, and\r\nbring Father Jodocus to do his office!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe serfs were much disgusted.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt never was so seen before, Herr\r\nFreiherr,\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated Heinz; \xe2\x80\x9cfang and hang was ever the word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shrift had my lord\xe2\x80\x99s father, or mine?\xe2\x80\x9d added Koppel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, turning sharply.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf Schlangenwald be a godless\r\nruffian, pitiless alike to soul and body, is that a cause that I should\r\nstain myself too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt were true vengeance,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Koppel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d grumbled Ulrich, \xe2\x80\x9cwill my lady hear, and there will be feeble\r\npleadings for the vermin\xe2\x80\x99s life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLike mutterings ensued, the purport of which was caught by Friedel, and\r\nmade him say to Ebbo, who would again have escaped the disagreeableness\r\nof the scene, \xe2\x80\x9cWe had better tarry at hand.  Unless we hold the folk in\r\nsome check there will be no right execution.  They will torture him to\r\ndeath ere the priest comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEbbo yielded, and began to pace the scanty area of the flat rock where\r\nthe need-fire was wont to blaze.  After a time he exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cFriedel,\r\nhow couldst ask me?  Knowst not that it sickens me to see a mountain cat\r\nkilled, save in full chase.  And thou\xe2\x80\x94why, thou art white as the snow\r\ncrags!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter conquer the folly than that he there should be put to needless\r\npain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, but with labouring breath that showed how terrible\r\nwas the prospect to his imaginative soul not inured to death-scenes like\r\nthose of his fellows.\r\n\r\nJust then a mocking laugh broke forth.  \xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ebbo, looking keenly\r\ndown, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do ye there?  Fang and hang may be fair; fang and torment is\r\nbase!  What was it, Lieschen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly, Herr Freiherr, the caitiff craved drink, and the fleischerinn gave\r\nhim a cup from the stream behind the slaughter-house, where we killed the\r\nswine.  Fit for the like of him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy heavens, when I forbade torture!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ebbo, leaping from the rock\r\nin time to see the disgusting draught held to the lips of the captive,\r\nwhose hands were twisted back and bound with cruel tightness; for the\r\nGerman boor, once roused from his lazy good-nature, was doubly savage\r\nfrom stolidity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWretches!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ebbo, striking right and left with the back of his\r\nsword, among the serfs, and then cutting the thong that was eating into\r\nthe prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s flesh, while Friedel caught up a wooden bowl, filled it\r\nwith pure water, and offered it to the captive, who drank deeply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9chast ought to say for thyself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA low curse against things in general was the only answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat brought thee here?\xe2\x80\x9d continued Ebbo, in hopes of extracting some\r\nexcuse for pardon; but the prisoner only hung his head as one stupefied,\r\nbrutally indifferent and hardened against the mere trouble of answering.\r\nNot another word could be extracted, and Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s position was very\r\nuncomfortable, keeping guard over his condemned felon, with the sulky\r\npeasants herding round, in fear of being balked of their prey; and the\r\nreluctance growing on him every moment to taking life in cold blood.\r\nRight of life and death was a heavy burden to a youth under seventeen,\r\nunless he had been thoughtless and reckless, and from this Ebbo had been\r\nprevented by his peculiar life.  The lion cub had never tasted blood.\r\n\r\nThe situation was prolonged beyond expectation.\r\n\r\nMany a time had the brothers paced their platform of rock, the criminal\r\nhad fallen into a dose, and women and boys were murmuring that they must\r\ncall home their kine and goats, and it was a shame to debar them of the\r\nsight of the hanging, long before Hans came back between crying and\r\nstammering, to say that Father Jodocus had fallen into so deep a study\r\nover his book, that he only muttered \xe2\x80\x9cComing,\xe2\x80\x9d then went into another\r\nmusing fit, whence no one could rouse him to do more than say \xe2\x80\x9cComing!\r\nLet him wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go and bring him, if the thing is to be done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd let it last all night!\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo, if the man were to\r\ndie, it should be at once, not by inches.  Hark thee, rogue!\xe2\x80\x9d stirring\r\nhim with his foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, \xe2\x80\x9cis the hanging ready yet?  You\xe2\x80\x99ve been long\r\nenough about it for us to have twisted the necks of every Adlerstein of\r\nyou all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook thee, caitiff!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo; \xe2\x80\x9cthou meritest the rope as well as any\r\nwolf on the mountain, but we have kept thee so long in suspense, that if\r\nthou canst say a word for thy life, or pledge thyself to meddle no more\r\nwith my lands, I\xe2\x80\x99ll consider of thy doom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have had plenty of time to consider it,\xe2\x80\x9d growled the fellow.\r\n\r\nA murmur, followed by a wrathful shout, rose among the villagers.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLetting off the villain!  No!  No!  Out upon him!  He dares not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDare!\xe2\x80\x9d thundered Ebbo, with flashing eyes.  \xe2\x80\x9cRascals as ye are, think ye\r\nto hinder me from daring?  Your will to be mine?  There, fellow; away\r\nwith thee!  Up to the Gemsbock\xe2\x80\x99s Pass!  And whoso would follow him, let\r\nhim do so at his peril!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe prisoner was prompt to gather himself up and rush like a hunted\r\nanimal to the path, at the entrance of which stood both twins, with drawn\r\nswords, to defend the escape.  Of course no one ventured to follow; and\r\nsurly discontented murmurs were the sole result as the peasants\r\ndispersed.  Ebbo, sheathing his sword, and putting his arm into his\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s, said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Friedel, turned stony-hearted?  Hadst never a\r\nword for the poor caitiff?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew thou wouldst never do the deed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was such wretched prey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cYet shall I be despised for\r\nthis!  Would that thou hadst let me string him up shriftless, as any\r\nother man had done, and there would have been an end of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd even his mother\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction did not greatly comfort Ebbo, for he\r\nwas of the age to feel more ashamed of a solecism than a crime.\r\nChristina perceived that this was one of his most critical periods of\r\nlife, baited as he was by the enemy of his race, and feeling all the\r\ndisadvantages which heart and conscience gave him in dealing with a man\r\nwho had neither, at a time when public opinion was always with the most\r\nmasterful.  The necessity of arming his retainers and having fighting men\r\nas a guard were additional temptations to hereditary habits of violence;\r\nand that so proud and fiery a nature as his should never become involved\r\nin them was almost beyond hope.  Even present danger seemed more around\r\nthan ever before.  The estate was almost in a state of siege, and\r\nChristina never saw her sons quit the castle without thinking of their\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s fate, and passing into the chapel to entreat for their return\r\nunscathed in body or soul.  The snow, which she had so often hailed as a\r\nfriend, was never more welcome than this winter; not merely as shutting\r\nthe enemy out, and her sons in, but as cutting off all danger of a visit\r\nfrom her suitor, who would now come armed with his late sufferings in her\r\nbehalf; and, moreover, with all the urgent need of a wise and respected\r\nhead and protector for her sons.  Yet the more evident the expediency\r\nbecame, the greater grew her distaste.\r\n\r\nStill the lonely life weighed heavily on Ebbo.  Light-hearted Friedel was\r\never busy and happy, were he chasing the grim winter game\xe2\x80\x94the bear and\r\nwolf\xe2\x80\x94with his brother, fencing in the hall, learning Greek with the\r\nchaplain, reading or singing to his mother, or carving graceful angel\r\nforms to adorn the chapel.  Or he could at all times soar into a minstrel\r\ndream of pure chivalrous semi-allegorical romance, sometimes told over\r\nthe glowing embers to his mother and brother.  All that came to Friedel\r\nwas joy, from battling with the bear on a frozen rock, to persuading rude\r\nlittle Hans to come to the Frau Freiherrinn to learn his Paternoster.\r\nBut the elder twin might hunt, might fence, might smile or kindle at his\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s lay, but ever with a restless gloom on him, a doubt of the\r\nfuture which made him impatient of the present, and led to a sharpness\r\nand hastiness of manner that broke forth in anger at slight offences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe matron\xe2\x80\x99s coif succeeding the widow\xe2\x80\x99s veil,\xe2\x80\x9d Friedel heard him\r\nmuttering even in sleep, and more than once listened to it as Ebbo leant\r\nover the battlements\xe2\x80\x94as he looked over the white world to the gray mist\r\nabove the city of Ulm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou, who mockest my forebodings and fancies, to dwell on that gipsy\r\naugury!\xe2\x80\x9d argued Friedel.  \xe2\x80\x9cAs thou saidst at the time, Wildschloss\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlooks gave shrewd cause for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe answer is in mine own heart,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cSince our stay at\r\nUlm, I have ever felt as though the sweet motherling were less my own!\r\nAnd the same with my house and lands.  Rule as I will, a mocking laugh\r\ncomes back to me, saying: \xe2\x80\x98Thou art but a boy, Sir Baron, thou dost but\r\nplay at lords and knights.\xe2\x80\x99  If I had hung yon rogue of a reiter, I\r\nwonder if I had felt my grasp more real?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, glancing from the sparkling white slopes to the pure\r\nblue above, \xe2\x80\x9cour whole life is but a play at lords and knights, with the\r\nblessed saints as witnesses of our sport in the tilt-yard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere it merely that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cI were not so galled.\r\nSomething hangs over us, Friedel!  I long that these snows would melt,\r\nthat I might at least know what it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\nBRIDGING THE FORD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe snow melted, the torrent became a flood, then contracted itself, but\r\nwas still a broad stream, when one spring afternoon Ebbo showed his\r\nbrother some wains making for the ford, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cIt cannot be rightly\r\npassable.  They will come to loss.  I shall get the men together to aid\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe blew a blast on his horn, and added, \xe2\x80\x9cThe knaves will be alert enough\r\nif they hope to meddle with honest men\xe2\x80\x99s luggage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee,\xe2\x80\x9d and Friedel pointed to the thicket to the westward of the meadow\r\naround the stream, where the beech trees were budding, but not yet\r\nforming a full mass of verdure, \xe2\x80\x9cis not the Snake in the wood?  Methinks\r\nI spy the glitter of his scales.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy heavens, the villains are lying in wait for the travellers at our\r\nlanding-place,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ebbo, and again raising the bugle to his lips, he\r\nsent forth three notes well known as a call to arms.  Their echoes came\r\nback from the rocks, followed instantly by lusty jodels, and the brothers\r\nrushed into the hall to take down their light head-pieces and corslets,\r\nanswering in haste their mother\xe2\x80\x99s startled questions, by telling of the\r\nendangered travellers, and the Schlangenwald ambush.  She looked white\r\nand trembled, but said no word to hinder them; only as she clasped\r\nFriedel\xe2\x80\x99s corslet, she entreated them to take fuller armour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must speed the short way down the rock,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9cand cannot be\r\ncumbered with heavy harness.  Sweet motherling, fear not; but let a meal\r\nbe spread for our rescued captives.  Ho, Heinz, \xe2\x80\x99tis against the\r\nSchlangenwald rascals.  Art too stiff to go down the rock path?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; nor down the abyss, could I strike a good stroke against\r\nSchlangenwald at the bottom of it,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Heinz.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor see vermin set free by the Freiherr,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Koppel; but the words\r\nwere lost in Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s loud commands to the men, as Friedel and Hatto handed\r\ndown the weapons to them.\r\n\r\nThe convoy had by this time halted, evidently to try the ford.  A\r\nhorseman crossed, and found it practicable, for a waggon proceeded to\r\nmake the attempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow is our time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, who was standing on the narrow ledge\r\nbetween the castle and the precipitous path leading to the meadow.  \xe2\x80\x9cOne\r\nwaggon may get over, but the second or third will stick in the ruts that\r\nit leaves.  Now we will drop from our crag, and if the Snake falls on\r\nthem, why, then for a pounce of the Eagle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two young knights, so goodly in their bright steel, knelt for their\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s blessing, and then sprang like chamois down the ivy-twined\r\nsteep, followed by their men, and were lost to sight among the bushes and\r\nrocks.  Yet even while her frame quivered with fear, her heart swelled at\r\nthe thought what a gulf there was between these days and those when she\r\nhad hidden her face in despair, while Ermentrude watched the Debateable\r\nFord.\r\n\r\nShe watched now in suspense, indeed, but with exultation instead of\r\nshame, as two waggons safely crossed; but the third stuck fast, and\r\npresently turned over in the stream, impelled sideways by the efforts of\r\nthe struggling horses.  Then, amid endeavours to disentangle the animals\r\nand succour the driver, the travellers were attacked by a party of armed\r\nmen, who dashed out of the beechwood, and fell on the main body of the\r\nwaggons, which were waiting on the bit of bare shingly soil that lay\r\nbetween the new and old channels.  A wild m\xc3\xaal\xc3\xa9e was all that Christina\r\ncould see\xe2\x80\x94weapons raised, horses starting, men rushing from the river,\r\nwhile the clang and the shout rose even to the castle.\r\n\r\nHark!  Out rings the clear call, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Eagle to the rescue!\xe2\x80\x9d  There they\r\nspeed over the meadow, the two slender forms with glancing helms!  O\r\noverrun not the followers, rush not into needless danger!  There is\r\nKoppel almost up with them with his big axe\xe2\x80\x94Heinz\xe2\x80\x99s broad shoulders near.\r\nHeaven strike with them!  Visit not their forefathers\xe2\x80\x99 sin on those pure\r\nspirits.  Some are flying.  Some one has fallen!  O heavens! on which\r\nside?  Ah! it is into the Schlangenwald woods that the fugitives direct\r\ntheir flight.  Three\xe2\x80\x94four\xe2\x80\x94the whole troop pursued!  Go not too far!  Run\r\nnot into needless risk!  Your work is done, and gallantly.  Well done,\r\nyoung knights of Adlerstein!  Which of you is it that stands pointing out\r\nsafe standing-ground for the men that are raising the waggon?  Which of\r\nyou is it who stands in converse with a burgher form?  Thanks and\r\nblessings! the lads are safe, and full knightly hath been their first\r\nemprise.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour later, a gay step mounted the ascent, and Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbright face laughed from his helmet: \xe2\x80\x9cThere, mother, will you crown your\r\nknights?  Could you see Ebbo bear down the chief squire? for the old\r\nSnake was not there himself.  And whom do you think we rescued, besides a\r\nwhole band of Venetian traders to whom he had joined himself?  Why, my\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s friend, the architect, of whom he used to speak\xe2\x80\x94Master Moritz\r\nSchleiermacher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoritz Schleiermacher!  I knew him as a boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had been laying out a Lustgarten for the Romish king at Innspruck,\r\nand he is a stout man of his hands, and attempted defence; but he had\r\nsuch a shrewd blow before we came up, that he lay like one dead; and when\r\nhe was lifted up, he gazed at us like one moon-struck, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Are my\r\neyes dazed, or are these the twins of Adlerstein, that are as like as\r\nface to mirror?  Lads, lads, your uncle looked not to hear of you acting\r\nin this sort.\xe2\x80\x99  But soon we and his people let him know how it was, and\r\nthat eagles do not have the manner of snakes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Master Moritz!  Is he much hurt?  Is Ebbo bringing him up hither?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, mother, he is but giddied and stunned, and now must you send down\r\nstore of sausage, sourkraut, meat, wine, and beer; for the wains cannot\r\nall cross till daylight, and we must keep ward all night lest the\r\nSchlangenwalden should fall on them again.  Plenty of good cheer, mother,\r\nto make a right merry watch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake heed, Friedel mine; a merry watch is scarce a safe one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so, sweet motherling, and therefore must Ebbo and I share it.  You\r\nmust mete out your liquor wisely, you see, enough for the credit of\r\nAdlerstein, and enough to keep out the marsh fog, yet not enough to make\r\nus snore too soundly.  I am going to take my lute; it would be using it\r\nill not to let it enjoy such a chance as a midnight watch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo away went the light-hearted boy, and by and by Christina saw the red\r\nwatch-fire as she gazed from her turret window.  She would have been\r\npleased to see how, marshalled by a merchant who had crossed the desert\r\nfrom Egypt to Palestine, the waggons were ranged in a circle, and the\r\nwatches told off, while the food and drink were carefully portioned out.\r\n\r\nFreiherr Ebbo, on his own ground, as champion and host, was far more at\r\nease than in the city, and became very friendly with the merchants and\r\narchitect as they sat round the bright fire, conversing, or at times\r\nchallenging the mountain echoes by songs to the sound of Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s lute.\r\nWhen the stars grew bright, most lay down to sleep in the waggons, while\r\nothers watched, pacing up and down till Karl\xe2\x80\x99s waggon should be over the\r\nmountain, and the vigil was relieved.\r\n\r\nNo disturbance took place, and at sunrise a hasty meal was partaken of,\r\nand the work of crossing the river was set in hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPity,\xe2\x80\x9d said Moritz, the architect, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this ford were not spanned by a\r\nbridge, to the avoiding of danger and spoil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho could build such a bridge?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ebbo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYourself, Herr Freiherr, in union with us burghers of Ulm.  It were well\r\nworth your while to give land and stone, and ours to give labour and\r\nskill, provided we fixed a toll on the passage, which would be willingly\r\npaid to save peril and delay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe brothers caught at the idea, and the merchants agreed that such a\r\nbridge would be an inestimable boon to all traffickers between Constance,\r\nUlm, and Augsburg, and would attract many travellers who were scared away\r\nby the evil fame of the Debateable Ford.  Master Moritz looked at the\r\nstone of the mountain, pronounced it excellent material, and already\r\nsketched the span of the arches with a view to winter torrents.  As to\r\nthe site, the best was on the firm ground above the ford; but here only\r\none side was Adlerstein, while on the other Ebbo claimed both banks, and\r\nit was probable that an equally sound foundation could be obtained, only\r\nwith more cost and delay.\r\n\r\nAfter this survey, the travellers took leave of the barons, promising to\r\nwrite when their fellow-citizens should have been sounded as to the\r\nbridge; and Ebbo remained in high spirits, with such brilliant purposes\r\nthat he had quite forgotten his gloomy forebodings.  \xe2\x80\x9cPeace instead of\r\nwar at home,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cwith the revenue it will bring, I will build a\r\nmill, and set our lads to work, so that they may become less dull and\r\ndoltish than their parents.  Then will we follow the Emperor with a train\r\nthat none need despise!  No one will talk now of Adlerstein not being\r\nable to take care of himself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLetters came from Ulm, saying that the guilds of mercers and wine\r\nmerchants were delighted with the project, and invited the Baron of\r\nAdlerstein to a council at the Rathhaus.  Master Sorel begged the mother\r\nto come with her sons to be his guest; but fearing the neighbourhood of\r\nSir Kasimir, she remained at home, with Heinz for her seneschal while her\r\nsons rode to the city.  There Ebbo found that his late exploit and his\r\nfuture plan had made him a person of much greater consideration than on\r\nhis last visit, and he demeaned himself with far more ease and affability\r\nin consequence.  He had affairs on his hands too, and felt more than one\r\nyear older.\r\n\r\nThe two guilds agreed to build the bridge, and share the toll with the\r\nBaron in return for the ground and materials; but they preferred the plan\r\nthat placed one pier on the Schlangenwald bank, and proposed to write to\r\nthe Count an offer to include him in the scheme, awarding him a share of\r\nthe profits in proportion to his contribution.  However vexed at the turn\r\naffairs had taken, Ebbo could offer no valid objection, and was obliged\r\nto affix his signature to the letter in company with the guildmasters.\r\n\r\nIt was despatched by the city pursuivants\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    The only men who safe might ride;\r\n    Their errands on the border side;\r\n\r\nand a meeting was appointed in the Rathhaus for the day of their expected\r\nreturn.  The higher burghers sat on their carved chairs in the grand old\r\nhall, the lesser magnates on benches, and Ebbo, in an elbowed seat far\r\ntoo spacious for his slender proportions, met a glance from Friedel that\r\ntold him his merry brother was thinking of the frog and the ox.  The\r\npursuivants entered\xe2\x80\x94hardy, shrewd-looking men, with the city arms decking\r\nthem wherever there was room for them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonour-worthy sirs,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, \xe2\x80\x9cno letter did the Graf von\r\nSchlangenwald return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSent he no message?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Moritz Schleiermacher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea, worthy sir, but scarce befitting this reverend assembly.\xe2\x80\x9d  On being\r\npressed, however, it was repeated: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord Count was pleased to swear\r\nat what he termed the insolence of the city in sending him heralds, \xe2\x80\x98as\r\nif,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98the dogs,\xe2\x80\x99 your worships, \xe2\x80\x98were his equals.\xe2\x80\x99  Then having\r\ncursed your worships, he reviled the crooked writing of Herr Clerk\r\nDiedrichson, and called his chaplain to read it to him.  Herr Priest\r\ncould scarce read three lines for his foul language about the ford.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98would he consent to raising a bridge\xe2\x80\x94a mean trick,\xe2\x80\x99 so\r\nsaid he, \xe2\x80\x98for defrauding him of his rights to what the flood sent him.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9ctook he no note of our explanation, that if he give\r\nnot the upper bank, we will build lower, where both sides are my own?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe passed it not entirely over,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the messenger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat said he\xe2\x80\x94the very words?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Ebbo, with the paling cheek and\r\nlow voice that made his passion often seem like patience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said\xe2\x80\x94(the Herr Freiherr will pardon me for repeating the words)\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98Tell the misproud mongrel of Adlerstein that he had best sit firm\r\nin his own saddle ere meddling with his betters, and if he touch one\r\npebble of the Braunwasser, he will rue it.  And before your city-folk\r\ntake up with him or his, they had best learn whether he have any right at\r\nall in the case.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis right is plain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Gottfried; \xe2\x80\x9cfull proofs were given in,\r\nand his investiture by the Kaisar forms a title in itself.  It is mere\r\nbravado, and an endeavour to make mischief between the Baron and the\r\ncity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so did I explain, Herr Guildmaster,\xe2\x80\x9d said the pursuivant; \xe2\x80\x9cbut,\r\npardon me, the Count laughed me to scorn, and quoth he, \xe2\x80\x98asked the Kaisar\r\nfor proof of his father\xe2\x80\x99s death!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMere mischief-making, as before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Gottfried, while his\r\nnephews started with amaze.  \xe2\x80\x9cHis father\xe2\x80\x99s death was proved by an\r\neye-witness, whom you still have in your train, have you not, Herr\r\nFreiherr?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9che is at Adlerstein now, Heinrich Bauermann, called\r\nthe Schneiderlein, a lanzknecht, who alone escaped the slaughter, and\r\nfrom whom we have often heard how my father died, choked in his own\r\nblood, from a deep breast-wound, immediately after he had sent home his\r\nlast greetings to my lady mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas the corpse restored?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the able Rathsherr Ulrich.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cAlmost all our retainers had perished, and when a\r\nfriar was sent to the hostel to bring home the remains, it appeared that\r\nthe treacherous foe had borne them off\xe2\x80\x94nay, my grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s head was\r\nsent to the Diet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe whole assembly agreed that the Count could only mean to make the\r\nabsence of direct evidence about a murder committed eighteen years ago\r\ntell in sowing distrust between the allies.  The suggestion was not worth\r\na thought, and it was plain that no site would be available except the\r\nDebateable Strand.  To this, however, Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s title was assailable, both\r\non account of his minority, as well as his father\xe2\x80\x99s unproved death, and\r\nof the disputed claim to the ground.  The Rathsherr, Master Gottfried,\r\nand others, therefore recommended deferring the work till the Baron\r\nshould be of age, when, on again tendering his allegiance, he might\r\nobtain a distinct recognition of his marches.  But this policy did not\r\nconsort with the quick spirit of Moritz Schleiermacher, nor with the\r\nconvenience of the mercers and wine-merchants, who were constant\r\nsufferers by the want of a bridge, and afraid of waiting four years, in\r\nwhich a lad like the Baron might return to the nominal instincts of his\r\nclass, or the Braunwasser might take back the land it had given; whilst\r\nEbbo himself was urgent, with all the defiant fire of youth, to begin\r\nbuilding at once in spite of all gainsayers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrife and blood will it cost,\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Sorel, gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can be had worth the having save at cost of strife and blood?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEbbo, with a glance of fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYouth speaks of counting the cost.  Little knows it what it saith,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsighed Master Gottfried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Rathsherr, \xe2\x80\x9cwere it otherwise, who would have the\r\nheart for enterprise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the young knights mounted, and had ridden about half the way in\r\nsilence, when Ebbo exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cFriedel\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and as his brother started, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nart musing on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat thou art thinking of,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, turning on him an eye that had\r\nnot only something of the brightness but of the penetration of a sunbeam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not think thereon at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, gloomily.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a figment\r\nof the old serpent to hinder us from snatching his prey from him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot but remember that the Genoese\r\nmerchant of old told us of a German noble sold by his foes to the Moors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFolly!  That tale was too recent to concern my father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not think it did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel; \xe2\x80\x9cbut mayhap that noble\xe2\x80\x99s family\r\nrest equally certain of his death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPfui!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, hotly; \xe2\x80\x9chast not heard fifty times how he died even in\r\nspeaking, and how Heinz crossed his hands on his breast?  What wouldst\r\nhave more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHardly even that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, slightly smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTush!\xe2\x80\x9d hastily returned his brother, \xe2\x80\x9cI meant only by way of proof.\r\nWould an honest old fellow like Heinz be a deceiver?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot wittingly.  Yet I would fain ride to that hostel and make\r\ninquiries!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe traitor host met his deserts, and was broken on the wheel for\r\nmurdering a pedlar a year ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cI would I knew where my\r\nfather was buried, for then would I bring his corpse honourably back; but\r\nas to his being a living man, I will not have it spoken of to trouble my\r\nmother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo trouble her?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Friedel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo trouble her,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cLong since hath passed the pang of his\r\nloss, and there is reason in what old Sorel says, that he must have been\r\na rugged, untaught savage, with little in common with the gentle one, and\r\nthat tender memory hath decked him out as he never could have been.  Nay,\r\nFriedel, it is but sense.  What could a man have been under the\r\ngranddame\xe2\x80\x99s breeding?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt becomes not thee to say so!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Friedel.  \xe2\x80\x9cNay, he could learn\r\nto love our mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne sign of grace, but doubtless she loved him the better for their\r\nhaving been so little together.  Her heart is at peace, believing him in\r\nhis grave; but let her imagine him in Schlangenwald\xe2\x80\x99s dungeon, or some\r\nMoorish galley, if thou likest it better, and how will her mild spirit be\r\nrent!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might be so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, thoughtfully.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be best to keep\r\nthis secret from her till we have fuller certainty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgreed then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9cunless the Wildschloss fellow should again\r\nmolest us, when his answer is ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this just towards my mother?\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust!  What mean\xe2\x80\x99st thou?  Is it not our office and our dearest right to\r\nshield our mother from care?  And is not her chief wish to be rid of the\r\nWildschloss suit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNevertheless Ebbo was moody all the way home, but when there he devoted\r\nhimself in his most eager and winning way to his mother, telling her of\r\nMaster Gottfried\xe2\x80\x99s woodcuts, and Hausfrau Johanna\xe2\x80\x99s rheumatism, and of\r\nall the news of the country, in especial that the Kaisar was at Lintz,\r\nvery ill with a gangrene in his leg, said to have been caused by his\r\nhabit of always kicking doors open, and that his doctors thought of\r\namputation, a horrible idea in the fifteenth century.  The young baron\r\nwas evidently bent on proving that no one could make his mother so happy\r\nas he could; and he was not far wrong there.\r\n\r\nFriedel, however, could not rest till he had followed Heinz to the\r\nstable, and speaking over the back of the old white mare, the only other\r\nsurvivor of the massacre, had asked him once more for the particulars, a\r\ntale he was never loth to tell; but when Friedel further demanded whether\r\nhe was certain of having seen the death of his younger lord, he replied,\r\nas if hurt: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, think you I would have quitted him while life was yet\r\nin him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, certainly, good Heinz; yet I would fain know by what tokens thou\r\nknewest his death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!  Sir Friedel; when you have seen a stricken field or two, you will\r\nnot ask how I know death from life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs a swoon so utterly unlike death?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say not but that an inexperienced youth might be mistaken,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHeinz; \xe2\x80\x9cbut for one who had learned the bloody trade, it were impossible.\r\nWhy ask, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, low and mysteriously\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmy brother would not have\r\nmy mother know it, but\xe2\x80\x94Count Schlangenwald demanded whether we could\r\nprove my father\xe2\x80\x99s death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProve!  He could not choose but die with three such wounds, as the old\r\nruffian knows.  I shall bless the day, Sir Friedmund, when I see you or\r\nyour brother give back those strokes!  A heavy reckoning be his.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe all deem that line only meant to cross our designs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet, Heinz, I would I knew how to find out what passed when thou wast\r\ngone.  Is there no servant at the inn\xe2\x80\x94no retainer of Schlangenwald that\r\naught could be learnt from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy St. Gertrude,\xe2\x80\x9d roughly answered the Schneiderlein, \xe2\x80\x9cif you cannot be\r\nsatisfied with the oath of a man like me, who would have given his life\r\nto save your father, I know not what will please you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFriedel, with his wonted good-nature, set himself to pacify the warrior\r\nwith assurances of his trust; yet while Ebbo plunged more eagerly into\r\nplans for the bridge-building, Friedel drew more and more into his old\r\nworld of musings; and many a summer afternoon was spent by him at the\r\nPtarmigan\xe2\x80\x99s Mere, in deep communings with himself, as one revolving a\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nChristina could not but observe, with a strange sense of foreboding,\r\nthat, while one son was more than ever in the lonely mountain heights,\r\nthe other was far more at the base.  Master Moritz Schleiermacher was a\r\nconstant guest at the castle, and Ebbo was much taken up with his\r\ncompanionship.  He was a strong, shrewd man, still young, but with much\r\nexperience, and he knew how to adapt himself to intercourse with the\r\nproud nobility, preserving an independent bearing, while avoiding all\r\nthat haughtiness could take umbrage at; and thus he was acquiring a\r\ngreater influence over Ebbo than was perceived by any save the watchful\r\nmother, who began to fear lest her son was acquiring an infusion of\r\nworldly wisdom and eagerness for gain that would indeed be a severance\r\nbetween him and his brother.\r\n\r\nIf she had known the real difference that unconsciously kept her sons\r\napart, her heart would have ached yet more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\nFRIEDMUND IN THE CLOUDS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE stone was quarried high on the mountain, and a direct road was made\r\nfor bringing it down to the water-side.  The castle profited by the road\r\nin accessibility, but its impregnability was so far lessened.  However,\r\nas Ebbo said, it was to be a friendly harbour, instead of a robber crag,\r\nand in case of need the communication could easily be destroyed.  The\r\nblocks of stone were brought down, and wooden sheds were erected for the\r\nworkmen in the meadow.\r\n\r\nIn August, however, came tidings that, after two amputations of his\r\ndiseased limb, the Kaisar Friedrich III. had died\xe2\x80\x94it was said from over\r\nfree use of melons in the fever consequent on the operation.  His death\r\nwas not likely to make much change in the government, which had of late\r\nbeen left to his son.  At this time the King of the Romans (for the title\r\nof Kaisar was conferred only by coronation by the Pope, and this\r\nMaximilian never received) was at Innspruck collecting troops for the\r\ndeliverance of Styria and Carinthia from a horde of invading Turks.  The\r\nMarkgraf of Wurtemburg sent an intimation to all the Swabian League that\r\nthe new sovereign would be best pleased if their homage were paid to him\r\nin his camp at the head of their armed retainers.\r\n\r\nHere was the way of enterprise and honour open at last, and the young\r\nbarons of Adlerstein eagerly prepared for it, equipping their vassals and\r\nsending to Ulm to take three or four men-at-arms into their pay, so as to\r\nmake up twenty lances as the contingent of Adlerstein.  It was decided\r\nthat Christina should spend the time of their absence at Ulm, whither her\r\nsons would escort her on their way to the camp.  The last busy day was\r\nover, and in the summer evening Christina was sitting on the castle steps\r\nlistening to Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s eager talk of his plans of interesting his hero, the\r\nKing of the Romans, in his bridge, and obtaining full recognition of his\r\nclaim to the Debateable Strand, where the busy workmen could be seen far\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nPresently Ebbo, as usual when left to himself, grew restless for want of\r\nFriedel, and exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cThe musing fit is on him!\xe2\x80\x94he will stay all\r\nnight at the tarn if I fetch him not,\xe2\x80\x9d he set off in quest of him,\r\npassing through the hamlet to look for him in the chapel on his way.\r\n\r\nNot finding Friedel there, he was, however, some way up towards the tarn,\r\nwhen he met his brother wearing the beamy yet awestruck look that he\r\noften brought from the mountain height, yet with a steadfast expression\r\nof resolute purpose on his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, dreamer!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew where to seek thee!  Ever in the\r\nclouds!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have been to the tarn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, throwing his arm round his\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s neck in their boyish fashion.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt has been very dear to me,\r\nand I longed to see its gray depths once more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce!  Yea manifold times shalt thou see them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSchleiermacher tells me that these are no Janissaries, but a mere\r\nmiscreant horde, even by whom glory can scarce be gained, and no peril at\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is to me as if I were taking my leave\r\nof all these purple hollows and heaven-lighted peaks cleaving the sky.\r\nAll the more, Ebbo, since I have made up my mind to a resolution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, none of the old monkish fancies,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9cagainst them thou\r\nart sworn, so long as I am true knight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is not the monkish fancy, but I am convinced that it is my duty\r\nto strive to ascertain my father\xe2\x80\x99s fate.  Hold, I say not that it is\r\nthine.  Thou hast thy charge here\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLooking for a dead man,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Ebbo; \xe2\x80\x9ca proper quest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Friedel.  \xe2\x80\x9cAt the camp it will surely be possible to\r\nlearn, through either Schlangenwald or his men, how it went with my\r\nfather.  Men say that his surviving son, the Teutonic knight, is of very\r\ndifferent mould.  He might bring something to light.  Were it proved to\r\nbe as the Schneiderlein avers, then would our conscience be at rest; but,\r\nif he were in Schlangenwald\xe2\x80\x99s dungeon\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFolly!  Impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet men have pined eighteen years in dark vaults,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel; \xe2\x80\x9cand,\r\nwhen I think that so may he have wasted for the whole of our lives that\r\nhave been so free and joyous on his own mountain, it irks me to bound on\r\nthe heather or gaze at the stars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the serpent hath dared,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9cthough it is mere folly to\r\nthink of it, we would summon the League and have his castle about his\r\nears!  Not that I believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScarce do I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel; \xe2\x80\x9cbut there haunts me evermore the\r\ndescription of the kindly German chained between the decks of the\r\nCorsair\xe2\x80\x99s galley.  Once and again have I dreamt thereof.  And, Ebbo,\r\nrecollect the prediction that so fretted thee.  Might not yon\r\ndark-cheeked woman have had some knowledge of the East and its captives?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEbbo started, but resumed his former tone.  \xe2\x80\x9cSo thou wouldst begin thine\r\nerrantry like Sir Hildebert and Sir Hildebrand in the \xe2\x80\x98Rose garden\xe2\x80\x99?\r\nHave a care.  Such quests end in mortal conflict between the unknown\r\nfather and son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should know him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, enthusiastically, \xe2\x80\x9cor, at least, he\r\nwould know my mother\xe2\x80\x99s son in me; and, could I no otherwise ransom him, I\r\nwould ply the oar in his stead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fine exchange for my mother and me,\xe2\x80\x9d gloomily laughed Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9cto lose\r\nthee, my sublimated self, for a rude, savage lord, who would straightway\r\nundo all our work, and rate and misuse our sweet mother for being more\r\ncivilized than himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShame, Ebbo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Friedel, \xe2\x80\x9cor art thou but in jest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo far in jest that thou wilt never go, puissant Sir Hildebert,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned Ebbo, drawing him closer.  \xe2\x80\x9cThou wilt learn\xe2\x80\x94as I also trust to\r\ndo\xe2\x80\x94in what nameless hole the serpent hid his remains.  Then shall they be\r\nduly coffined and blazoned.  All the monks in the cloisters for twenty\r\nmiles round shall sing requiems, and thou and I will walk bareheaded,\r\nwith candles in our hands, by the bier, till we rest him in the Blessed\r\nFriedmund\xe2\x80\x99s chapel; and there Lucas Handlein shall carve his tomb, and\r\nthou shalt sit for the likeness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo may it end,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, \xe2\x80\x9cbut either I will know him dead, or\r\nendeavour somewhat in his behalf.  And that the need is real, as well as\r\nthe purpose blessed, I have become the more certain, for, Ebbo, as I rose\r\nto descend the hill, I saw on the cloud our patron\xe2\x80\x99s very form\xe2\x80\x94I saw\r\nmyself kneel before him and receive his blessing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEbbo burst out laughing.  \xe2\x80\x9cNow know I that it is indeed as saith\r\nSchleiermacher,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand that these phantoms of the Blessed\r\nFriedmund are but shadows cast by the sun on the vapours of the ravine.\r\nSee, Friedel, I had gone to seek thee at the chapel, and meeting Father\r\nNorbert, I bent my knee, that I might take his farewell blessing.  I had\r\nthe substance, thou the shadow, thou dreamer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFriedel was as much mortified for the moment as his gentle nature could\r\nbe.  Then he resumed his sweet smile, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cBe it so!  I have oft read\r\nthat men are too prone to take visions and special providences to\r\nthemselves, and now I have proved the truth of the saying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9cthou seest thy purpose is as baseless as thy vision?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Ebbo.  It grieves me to differ from thee, but my resolve is older\r\nthan the fancy, and may not be shaken because I was vain enough to\r\nbelieve that the Blessed Friedmund could stoop to bless me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Ebbo, glad to see an object on which to vent his secret\r\nannoyance.  \xe2\x80\x9cWho goes there, skulking round the rocks?  Here, rogue, what\r\nart after here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo harm,\xe2\x80\x9d sullenly replied a half-clad boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhence art thou?  From Schlangenwald, to spy what more we can be robbed\r\nof?  The lash\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Friedel.  \xe2\x80\x9cPerchance the poor lad had no evil\r\npurposes.  Didst lose thy way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, my mother sent me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought so,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cThis comes of sparing the nest of thankless\r\nadders!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, \xe2\x80\x9cmayhap it is because they are not thankless that\r\nthe poor fellow is here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, coming nearer, \xe2\x80\x9cI will tell _you_\xe2\x80\x94_you_ I will\r\ntell\xe2\x80\x94not him who threatens.  Mother said you spared our huts, and the\r\nlady gave us bread when we came to the castle gate in winter, and she\r\nwould not see the reiters lay waste your folk\xe2\x80\x99s doings down there without\r\nwarning you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good lad!  What saidst thou?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ebbo, but the boy seemed dumb\r\nbefore him, and Friedel repeated the question ere he answered: \xe2\x80\x9cAll the\r\nlanzknechts and reiters are at the castle, and the Herr Graf has taken\r\nall my father\xe2\x80\x99s young sheep for them, a plague upon him.  And our folk\r\nare warned to be at the muster rock to-morrow morn, each with a bundle of\r\nstraw and a pine brand; and Black Berend heard the body squire say the\r\nHerr Graf had sworn not to go to the wars till every stick at the ford be\r\nburnt, every stone drowned, every workman hung.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEbbo, in a transport of indignation and gratitude, thrust his hand into\r\nhis pouch, and threw the boy a handful of groschen, while Friedel gave\r\nwarm thanks, in the utmost haste, ere both brothers sprang with headlong\r\nspeed down the wild path, to take advantage of the timely intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe little council of war was speedily assembled, consisting of the\r\nbarons, their mother, Master Moritz Schleiermacher, Heinz, and Hatto.  To\r\nbring up to the castle the workmen, their families, and the more valuable\r\nimplements, was at once decided; and Christina asked whether there would\r\nbe anything left worth defending, and whether the Schlangenwalden might\r\nnot expend their fury on the scaffold, which could be newly supplied from\r\nthe forest, the huts, which could be quickly restored, and the stones,\r\nwhich could hardly be damaged.  The enemy must proceed to the camp in a\r\nday or two, and the building would be less assailable by their return;\r\nand, besides, it was scarcely lawful to enter on a private war when the\r\nimperial banner was in the field.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCraving your pardon, gracious lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said the architect, \xe2\x80\x9cthat blame\r\nrests with him who provokes the war.  See, lord baron, there is time to\r\nsend to Ulm, where the two guilds, our allies, will at once equip their\r\ntrained bands and despatch them.  We meanwhile will hold the knaves in\r\ncheck, and, by the time our burghers come up, the snake brood will have\r\nhad such a lesson as they will not soon forget.  Said I well, Herr\r\nFreiherr?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight bravely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt consorts not with our honour or rights,\r\nwith my pledges to Ulm, or the fame of my house, to shut ourselves up and\r\nsee the rogues work their will scatheless.  My own score of men, besides\r\nthe stouter masons, carpenters, and serfs, will be fully enough to make\r\nthe old serpent of the wood rue the day, even without the aid of the\r\nburghers.  Not a word against it, dearest mother.  None is so wise as\r\nthou in matters of peace, but honour is here concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy question is,\xe2\x80\x9d persevered the mother, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether honour be not better\r\nserved by obeying the summons of the king against the infidel, with the\r\nmen thou hast called together at his behest?  Let the count do his worst;\r\nhe gives thee legal ground of complaint to lay before the king and the\r\nLeague, and all may there be more firmly established.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat were admirable counsel, lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Schleiermacher, \xe2\x80\x9cwell suited to\r\nthe honour-worthy guildmaster Sorel, and to our justice-loving city; but,\r\nin matters of baronial rights and aggressions, king and League are wont\r\nto help those that help themselves, and those that are over nice as to\r\nlaw and justice come by the worst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the worst in the long run,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThine unearthly code will not serve us here, Friedel mine,\xe2\x80\x9d returned his\r\nbrother.  \xe2\x80\x9cDid I not defend the work I have begun, I should be branded as\r\na weak fool.  Nor will I see the foes of my house insult me without\r\nstriking a fair stroke.  Hap what hap, the Debateable Ford shall be\r\ndebated!  Call in the serfs, Hatto, and arm them.  Mother, order a good\r\nsupper for them.  Master Moritz, let us summon thy masons and carpenters,\r\nand see who is a good man with his hands among them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristina saw that remonstrance was vain.  The days of peril and violence\r\nwere coming back again; and all she could take comfort in was, that, if\r\nnot wholly right, her son was far from wholly wrong, and that with a free\r\nheart she could pray for a blessing on him and on his arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\nTHE FIGHT AT THE FORD\r\n\r\n\r\nBY the early September sunrise the thicket beneath the pass was\r\nsheltering the twenty well-appointed reiters of Adlerstein, each\r\nstanding, holding his horse by the bridle, ready to mount at the instant.\r\nIn their rear were the serfs and artisans, some with axes, scythes, or\r\nploughshares, a few with cross-bows, and Jobst and his sons with the long\r\nblackened poles used for stirring their charcoal fires.  In advance were\r\nMaster Moritz and the two barons, the former in a stout plain steel\r\nhelmet, cuirass, and gauntlets, a sword, and those new-fashioned weapons,\r\npistols; the latter in full knightly armour, exactly alike, from the\r\ngilt-spurred heel to the eagle-crested helm, and often moving restlessly\r\nforward to watch for the enemy, though taking care not to be betrayed by\r\nthe glitter of their mail.  So long did they wait that there was even a\r\ndoubt whether it might not have been a false alarm; the boy was\r\nvituperated, and it was proposed to despatch a spy to see whether\r\nanything were doing at Schlangenwald.\r\n\r\nAt length a rustling and rushing were heard; then a clank of armour.\r\nEbbo vaulted into the saddle, and gave the word to mount; Schleiermacher,\r\nwho always fought on foot, stepped up to him.  \xe2\x80\x9cKeep back your men, Herr\r\nFreiherr.  Let his design be manifest.  We must not be said to have\r\nfallen on him on his way to the muster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be but as he served my father!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Ebbo, forced, however,\r\nto restrain himself, though with boiling blood, as the tramp of horses\r\nshook the ground, and bright armour became visible on the further side of\r\nthe stream.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, the brothers beheld the foe of their line.  He was\r\nseated on a clumsy black horse, and sheathed in full armour, and was\r\napparently a large heavy man, whose powerful proportions were becoming\r\nunwieldy as he advanced in life.  The dragon on his crest and shield\r\nwould have made him known to the twins, even without the deadly curse\r\nthat passed the Schneiderlein\xe2\x80\x99s lips at the sight.  As the armed troop,\r\nout-numbering the Adlersteiners by about a dozen, and followed by a\r\nrabble with straw and pine brands, came forth on the meadow, the count\r\nhalted and appeared to be giving orders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ruffian!  He is calling them on!  Now\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d began Ebbo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, there is no sign yet that he is not peacefully on his journey to\r\nthe camp,\xe2\x80\x9d responded Moritz; and, chafing with impatient fury, the knight\r\nwaited while Schlangenwald rode towards the old channel of the\r\nBraunwasser, and there, drawing his rein, and sitting like a statue in\r\nhis stirrups, he could hear him shout: \xe2\x80\x9cThe lazy dogs are not astir yet.\r\nWe will give them a r\xc3\xa9veille.  Forward with your brands!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow!\xe2\x80\x9d and Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s cream-coloured horse leapt forth, as the whole band\r\nflashed into the sunshine from the greenwood covert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho troubles the workmen on my land?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Ebbo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho you may be I care not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the count, \xe2\x80\x9cbut when I find\r\nstrangers unlicensed on my lands, I burn down their huts.  On, fellows!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBack, fellows!\xe2\x80\x9d called Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhoso touches a stick on Adlerstein\r\nground shall suffer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo!\xe2\x80\x9d said the count, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is the burgher-bred, burgher-fed varlet, that\r\ncalls himself of Adlerstein!  Boy, thou had best be warned.  Wert thou\r\ntrue-blooded, it were worth my while to maintain my rights against thee.\r\nCraven as thou art, not even with spirit to accept my feud, I would fain\r\nnot have the trouble of sweeping thee from my path.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerr Graf, as true Freiherr and belted knight, I defy thee!  I proclaim\r\nmy right to this ground, and whoso damages those I place there must do\r\nbattle with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou wilt have it then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the count, taking his heavy lance from his\r\nsquire, closing his visor, and wheeling back his horse, so as to give\r\nspace for his career.\r\n\r\nEbbo did the like, while Friedel on one side, and Hierom von\r\nSchlangenwald on the other, kept their men in array, awaiting the issue\r\nof the strife between their leaders\xe2\x80\x94the fire of seventeen against the\r\nforce of fifty-six.\r\n\r\nThey closed in full shock, with shivered lances and rearing, pawing\r\nhorses, but without damage to either.  Each drew his sword, and they were\r\npressing together, when Heinz, seeing a Schlangenwalder aiming with his\r\ncross-bow, rode at him furiously, and the m\xc3\xaal\xc3\xa9e became general; shots\r\nwere fired, not only from cross-bows, but from arquebuses, and in the\r\nthrong Friedel lost sight of the main combat between his brother and the\r\ncount.\r\n\r\nSuddenly however there was a crash, as of falling men and horses, with a\r\nshout of victory strangely mingled with a cry of agony, and both sides\r\nbecame aware that their leaders had fallen.  Each party rushed to its\r\nfallen head.  Friedel beheld Ebbo under his struggling horse, and an\r\nenemy dashing at his throat, and, flying to the rescue, he rode down the\r\nassailant, striking him with his sword; and, with the instinct of driving\r\nthe foe as far as possible from his brother, he struck with a sort of\r\nfrenzy, shouting fiercely to his men, and leaping over the dry bed of the\r\nriver, rushing onward with an intoxication of ardour that would have\r\nseemed foreign to his gentle nature, but for the impetuous desire to\r\nprotect his brother.  Their leaders down, the enemy had no one to rally\r\nthem, and, in spite of their superiority in number, gave way in confusion\r\nbefore the furious onset of Adlerstein.  So soon, however, as Friedel\r\nperceived that he had forced the enemy far back from the scene of\r\nconflict, his anxiety for his brother returned, and, leaving the\r\nretainers to continue the pursuit, he turned his horse.  There, on the\r\ngreen meadow, lay on the one hand Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s cream-coloured charger, with his\r\nmaster under him, on the other the large figure of the count; and several\r\nother prostrate forms likewise struggled on the sand and pebbles of the\r\nstrand, or on the turf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the architect, who had turned with Friedel, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99twas a gallant\r\nfeat, Sir Friedel, and I trust there is no great harm done.  Were it the\r\nmere dint of the count\xe2\x80\x99s sword, your brother will be little the worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEbbo!  Ebbo mine, look up!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Friedel, leaping from his horse, and\r\nunclasping his brother\xe2\x80\x99s helmet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriedel!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned a half-suffocated voice.  \xe2\x80\x9cO take away the horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne or two of the artisans were at hand, and with their help the dying\r\nsteed was disengaged from the rider, who could not restrain his moans,\r\nthough Friedel held him in his arms, and endeavoured to move him as\r\ngently as possible.  It was then seen that the deep gash from the count\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsword in the chest was not the most serious injury, but that an arquebus\r\nball had pierced his thigh, before burying itself in the body of his\r\nhorse; and that the limb had been further crushed and wrenched by the\r\nanimal\xe2\x80\x99s struggles.  He was nearly unconscious, and gasped with anguish,\r\nbut, after Moritz had bathed his face and moistened his lips, as he lay\r\nin his brother\xe2\x80\x99s arms, he looked up with clearer eyes, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cHave I\r\nslain him?  It was the shot, not he, that sent me down.  Lives he?\r\nSee\xe2\x80\x94thou, Friedel\xe2\x80\x94thou.  Make him yield.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTransferring Ebbo to the arms of Schleiermacher, Friedel obeyed, and\r\nstepped towards the fallen foe.  The wrongs of Adlerstein were indeed\r\navenged, for the blood was welling fast from a deep thrust above the\r\ncollar-bone, and the failing, feeble hand was wandering uncertainly among\r\nthe clasps of the gorget.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me aid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, kneeling down, and in his pity for the dying\r\nman omitting the summons to yield, he threw back the helmet, and beheld a\r\ngrizzled head and stern hard features, so embrowned by weather and\r\ninflamed by intemperance, that even approaching death failed to blanch\r\nthem.  A scowl of malignant hate was in the eyes, and there was a thrill\r\nof angry wonder as they fell on the lad\xe2\x80\x99s face.  \xe2\x80\x9cThou again,\xe2\x80\x94thou whelp!\r\nI thought at least I had made an end of thee,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, unheard by\r\nFriedel, who, intent on the thought that had recurred to him with greater\r\nvividness than ever, was again filling Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s helmet with water.  He\r\nrefreshed the dying man\xe2\x80\x99s face with it, held it to his lips, and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerr Graf, variance and strife are ended now.  For heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, say\r\nwhere I may find my father!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo!  Wouldst find him?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Schlangenwald, fixing his look on the\r\neager countenance of the youth, while his hand, with a dying man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnervous agitation, was fumbling at his belt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would bless you for ever, could I but free him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the count, speaking very slowly, and still holding the\r\nyoung knight\xe2\x80\x99s gaze with a sort of intent fascination, by the stony glare\r\nof his light gray eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cknow that thy villain father is a Turkish slave,\r\nunless he be\xe2\x80\x94as I hope\xe2\x80\x94where his mongrel son may find him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTherewith came a flash, a report; Friedel leaped back, staggered, fell;\r\nEbbo started to a sitting posture, with horrified eyes, and a loud\r\nshriek, calling on his brother; Moritz sprang to his feet, shouting,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShame! treason!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI call you to witness that I had not yielded,\xe2\x80\x9d said the count.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nan end of the brood!\xe2\x80\x9d and with a grim smile, he straightened his limbs,\r\nand closed his eyes as a dead man, ere the indignant artisans fell on him\r\nin savage vengeance.\r\n\r\nAll this had passed like a flash of lightning, and Friedel had almost at\r\nthe instant of his fall flung himself towards his brother, and raising\r\nhimself on one hand, with the other clasped Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cFear not; it\r\nis nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d and he was bending to take Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s head again on his knee,\r\nwhen a gush of dark blood, from his left side, caused Moritz to exclaim,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!  Sir Friedel, the traitor did his work!  That is no slight hurt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?  How?  The ruffian!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ebbo, supporting himself on his elbow,\r\nso as to see his brother, who rather dreamily put his hand to his side,\r\nand, looking at the fresh blood that immediately dyed it, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not\r\nfeel it.  This is more numb dulness than pain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bad sign that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Moritz, apart to one of the workmen, with whom he\r\nheld counsel how to carry back to the castle the two young knights, who\r\nremained on the bank, Ebbo partly extended on the ground, partly\r\nsupported on the knee and arm of Friedel, who sat with his head drooping\r\nover him, their looks fixed on one another, as if conscious of nothing\r\nelse on earth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerr Freiherr,\xe2\x80\x9d said Moritz, presently, \xe2\x80\x9chave you breath to wind your\r\nbugle to call the men back from the pursuit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEbbo essayed, but was too faint, and Friedel, rousing himself from the\r\nstupor, took the horn from him, and made the mountain echoes ring again,\r\nbut at the expense of a great effusion of blood.\r\n\r\nBy this time, however, Heinz was riding back, and a moment his exultation\r\nchanged to rage and despair, when he saw the condition of his young\r\nlords.  Master Schleiermacher proposed to lay them on some of the planks\r\nprepared for the building, and carry them up the new road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMethinks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I could ride if I were lifted on\r\nhorseback, and thus would our mother be less shocked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cGo on and cheer her.  Show her thou canst\r\nkeep the saddle, however it may be with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a groan of\r\nanguish.\r\n\r\nFriedel made the sign of the cross over him.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe holy cross keep us and\r\nher, Ebbo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he bent to assist in laying his brother on the\r\nboards, where a mantle had been spread; then kissed his brow, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nshall be together again soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEbbo was lifted on the shoulders of his bearers, and Friedel strove to\r\nrise, with the aid of Heinz, but sank back, unable to use his limbs; and\r\nSchleiermacher was the more concerned.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt goes so with the backbone,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said.  \xe2\x80\x9cSir Friedmund, you had best be carried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, for my mother\xe2\x80\x99s sake!  And I would fain be on my good steed\xe2\x80\x99s back\r\nonce again!\xe2\x80\x9d he entreated.  And when with much difficulty he had been\r\nlifted to the back of his cream-colour, who stood as gently and patiently\r\nas if he understood the exigency of the moment, he sat upright, and waved\r\nhis hand as he passed the litter, while Ebbo, on his side, signed to him\r\nto speed on and prepare their mother.  Long, however, before the castle\r\nwas reached, dizzy confusion and leaden helplessness, when no longer\r\nstimulated by his brother\xe2\x80\x99s presence, so grew on him that it was with\r\nmuch ado that Heinz could keep him in his saddle; but, when he saw his\r\nmother in the castle gateway, he again collected his forces, bade Heinz\r\nwithdraw his supporting arm, and, straightening himself, waved a greeting\r\nto her, as he called cheerily; \xe2\x80\x9cVictory, dear mother.  Ebbo has\r\noverthrown the count, and you must not be grieved if it be at some cost\r\nof blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, my son!\xe2\x80\x9d was all Christina could say, for his effort at gaiety\r\nformed a ghastly contrast with the gray, livid hue that overspread his\r\nfair young face, his bloody armour, and damp disordered hair, and even\r\nhis stiff unearthly smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, motherling,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, as she came so near that he could put his\r\narm round her neck, \xe2\x80\x9csorrow not, for Ebbo will need thee much.  And,\r\nmother,\xe2\x80\x9d as his face lighted up, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is joy coming to you.  Only I\r\nwould that I could have brought him.  Mother, he died not under the\r\nSchlangenwald swords.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?  Not Ebbo?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the bewildered mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour own Eberhard, our father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, raising her face to him\r\nwith his hand, and adding, as he met a startled look, \xe2\x80\x9cThe cruel count\r\nowned it with his last breath.  He is a Turkish slave, and surely heaven\r\nwill give him back to comfort you, even though we may not work his\r\nfreedom!  O mother, I had so longed for it, but God be thanked that at\r\nleast certainty was bought by my life.\xe2\x80\x9d  The last words were uttered\r\nalmost unconsciously, and he had nearly fallen, as the excitement faded;\r\nbut, as they were lifting him down, he bent once more and kissed the\r\nglossy neck of his horse.  \xe2\x80\x9cAh! poor fellow, thou too wilt be lonely.\r\nMay Ebbo yet ride thee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mother had no time for grief.  Alas!  She might have full time for\r\nthat by and by!  The one wish of the twins was to be together, and\r\npresently both were laid on the great bed in the upper chamber, Ebbo in a\r\nswoon from the pain of the transport, and Friedel lying so as to meet the\r\nfirst look of recovery.  And, after Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had re-opened, they\r\nwatched one another in silence for a short space, till Ebbo said: \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nthat the hue of death on thy face, brother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI well believe so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEver together,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, holding his hand.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut alas!  My mother!\r\nWould I had never sent thee to the traitor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!  So comes her comfort,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel.  \xe2\x80\x9cHeard you not?  He owned\r\nthat my father was among the Turks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cI have withheld thee!  O Friedel, had I listened\r\nto thee, thou hadst not been in this fatal broil!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, ever together,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Friedel.  \xe2\x80\x9cThrough Ulm merchants will my\r\nmother be able to ransom him.  I know she will, so oft have I dreamt of\r\nhis return.  Then, mother, you will give him our duteous greetings;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nhe smiled again.\r\n\r\nLike one in a dream Christina returned his smile, because she saw he\r\nwished it, just as the moment before she had been trying to staunch his\r\nwound.\r\n\r\nIt was plain that the injuries, except Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s sword-cut, were far beyond\r\nher skill, and she could only endeavour to check the bleeding till better\r\naid could be obtained from Ulm.  Thither Moritz Schleiermacher had\r\nalready sent, and he assured her that he was far from despairing of the\r\nelder baron, but she derived little hope from his words, for gunshot\r\nwounds were then so ill understood as generally to prove fatal.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there was an undefined impression that the two lives must end\r\nin the same hour, even as they had begun.  Indeed, Ebbo was suffering so\r\nterribly, and was so much spent with pain and loss of blood, that he\r\nseemed sinking much faster than Friedel, whose wound bled less freely,\r\nand who only seemed benumbed and torpid, except when he roused himself to\r\nspeak, or was distressed by the writhings and moans which, however, for\r\nhis sake, Ebbo restrained as much as he could.\r\n\r\nTo be together seemed an all-sufficient consolation, and, when the\r\nchaplain came sorrowfully to give them the last rites of the Church, Ebbo\r\nimplored him to pray that he might not be left behind long in purgatory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriedel,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, clasping his brother\xe2\x80\x99s hand, \xe2\x80\x9cis even like the holy\r\nSebastian or Maurice; but I\xe2\x80\x94I was never such as he.  O father, will it be\r\nmy penance to be left alone when he is in paradise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Friedel, partially roused by the sound of his name,\r\nand the involuntary pressure of his hand.  \xe2\x80\x9cNay, Ebbo; one repentance,\r\none cross, one hope,\xe2\x80\x9d and he relapsed into a doze, while Ebbo murmured\r\nover a broken, brief confession\xe2\x80\x94exhausting by its vehemence of\r\nself-accusation for his proud spirit, his wilful neglect of his lost\r\nfather, his hot contempt of prudent counsel.\r\n\r\nThen, when the priest came round to Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s side, and the boy was\r\nwakened to make his shrift, the words were contrite and humble, but calm\r\nand full of trust.  They were like two of their own mountain streams, the\r\nwaters almost equally undefiled by external stain\xe2\x80\x94yet one struggling,\r\nagitated, whirling giddily round; the other still, transparent, and the\r\nlight of heaven smiling in its clearness.\r\n\r\nThe farewell greetings of the Church on earth breathed soft and sweet in\r\ntheir loftiness, and Friedel, though lying motionless, and with closed\r\neyes, never failed in the murmured response, whether fully conscious or\r\nnot, while his brother only attended by fits and starts, and was\r\nevidently often in too much pain to know what was passing.\r\n\r\nHelp was nearer than had been hoped.  The summons despatched the night\r\nbefore had been responded to by the vintners and mercers; their train\r\nbands had set forth, and their captain, a cautious man, never rode into\r\nthe way of blows without his surgeon at hand.  And so it came to pass\r\nthat, before the sun was low on that long and grievous day, Doctor\r\nJohannes Butteman was led into the upper chamber, where the mother looked\r\nup to him with a kind of hopeless gratitude on her face, which was nearly\r\nas white as those of her sons.  The doctor soon saw that Friedel was past\r\nhuman aid; but, when he declared that there was fair hope for the other\r\nyouth, Friedel, whose torpor had been dispelled by the examination,\r\nlooked up with his beaming smile, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThere, motherling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor then declared that he could not deal with the Baron\xe2\x80\x99s wound\r\nunless he were the sole occupant of the bed, and this sentence brought\r\nthe first cloud of grief or dread to Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s brow, but only for a\r\nmoment.  He looked at his brother, who had again fainted at the first\r\ntouch of his wounded limb, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is well.  Tell the dear Ebbo\r\nthat I cannot help it if after all I go to the praying, and leave him the\r\nfighting.  Dear, dear Ebbo!  One day together again and for ever!  I\r\nleave thee for thine own sake.\xe2\x80\x9d  With much effort he signed the cross\r\nagain on his brother\xe2\x80\x99s brow, and kissed it long and fervently.  Then, as\r\nall stood round, reluctant to effect this severance, or disturb one on\r\nwhom death was visibly fast approaching, he struggled up on his elbow,\r\nand held out the other hand, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cTake me now, Heinz, ere Ebbo revive\r\nto be grieved.  The last sacrifice,\xe2\x80\x9d he further whispered, whilst almost\r\ngiving himself to Heinz and Moritz to be carried to his own bed in the\r\nturret chamber.\r\n\r\nThere, even as they laid him down, began what seemed to be the mortal\r\nagony, and, though he was scarcely sensible, his mother felt that her\r\nprime call was to him, while his brother was in other hands.  Perhaps it\r\nwas well for her.  Surgical practice was rough, and wounds made by\r\nfire-arms were thought to have imbibed a poison that made treatment be\r\nsupposed efficacious in proportion to the pain inflicted.  When Ebbo was\r\nrecalled by the torture to see no white reflection of his own face on the\r\npillow beside him, and to feel in vain for the grasp of the cold damp\r\nhand, a delirious frenzy seized him, and his struggles were frustrating\r\nthe doctor\xe2\x80\x99s attempts, when a low soft sweet song stole through the open\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriedel!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, and held his breath to listen.  All through the\r\ndeclining day did the gentle sound continue; now of grand chants or hymns\r\ncaught from the cathedral choir, now of songs of chivalry or saintly\r\nlegend so often sung over the evening fire; the one flowing into the\r\nother in the wandering of failing powers, but never failing in the tender\r\nsweetness that had distinguished Friedel through life.  And, whenever\r\nthat voice was heard, let them do to him what they would, Ebbo was still\r\nabsorbed in intense listening so as not to lose a note, and lulled almost\r\nout of sense of suffering by that swan-like music.  If his attendants\r\nmade such noise as to break in on it, or if it ceased for a moment, the\r\nanguish returned, but was charmed away by the weakest, faintest\r\nresumption of the song.  Probably Friedel knew not, with any earthly\r\nsense, what he was doing, but to the very last he was serving his twin\r\nbrother as none other could have aided him in his need.\r\n\r\nThe September sun had set, twilight was coming on, the doctor had worked\r\nhis stern will, and Ebbo, quivering in every fibre, lay spent on his\r\npillow, when his mother glided in, and took her seat near him, though\r\nwhere she hoped he would not notice her presence.  But he raised his\r\neyelids, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is not singing now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSinging indeed, but where we cannot hear him,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Whiter\r\nthan the snow, clearer than the ice-cave, more solemn than the choir.\r\nThey will come at last.\xe2\x80\x99  That was what he said, even as he entered\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d  And the low dove-like tone and tender calm face continued upon\r\nEbbo the spell that the chant had left.  He dozed as though still lulled\r\nby its echo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\nTHE WOUNDED EAGLE\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE star and the spark in the stubble!  Often did the presage of her\r\ndream occur to Christina, and assist in sustaining her hopes during the\r\ndays that Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s life hung in the balance, and he himself had hardly\r\nconsciousness to realize either his brother\xe2\x80\x99s death or his own state,\r\nsave as much as was shown by the words, \xe2\x80\x9cLet him not be taken away,\r\nmother; let him wait for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFriedmund did wait, in his coffin before the altar in the castle chapel,\r\ncovered with a pall of blue velvet, and great white cross, mournfully\r\nsent by Hausfrau Johanna; his sword, shield, helmet, and spurs laid on\r\nit, and wax tapers burning at the head and feet.  And, when Christina\r\ncould leave the one son on his couch of suffering, it was to kneel beside\r\nthe other son on his narrow bed of rest, and recall, like a breath of\r\nsolace, the heavenly loveliness and peace that rested on his features\r\nwhen she had taken her last long look at them.\r\n\r\nMoritz Schleiermacher assisted at Sir Friedmund\xe2\x80\x99s first solemn requiem,\r\nand then made a journey to Ulm, whence he returned to find the Baron\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndanger so much abated that he ventured on begging for an interview with\r\nthe lady, in which he explained his purpose of repairing at once to the\r\nimperial camp, taking with him a letter from the guilds concerned in the\r\nbridge, and using his personal influence with Maximilian to obtain not\r\nonly pardon for the combat, but authoritative sanction to the erection.\r\nDankwart of Schlangenwald, the Teutonic knight, and only heir of old\r\nWolfgang, was supposed to be with the Emperor, and it might be possible\r\nto come to terms with him, since his breeding in the Prussian\r\ncommanderies had kept him aloof from the feuds of his father and brother.\r\nThis mournful fight had to a certain extent equalized the injuries on\r\neither side, since the man whom Friedel had cut down was Hierom, one of\r\nthe few remaining scions of Schlangenwald, and there was thus no\r\ndishonour in trying to close the deadly feud, and coming to an amicable\r\narrangement about the Debateable Strand, the cause of so much bloodshed.\r\nWhat was now wanted was Freiherr Eberhard\xe2\x80\x99s signature to the letter to\r\nthe Emperor, and his authority for making terms with the new count; and\r\nhaste was needed, lest the Markgraf of Wurtemburg should represent the\r\naffray in the light of an outrage against a member of the League.\r\n\r\nChristina saw the necessity, and undertook if possible to obtain her\r\nson\xe2\x80\x99s signature, but, at the first mention of Master Moritz and the\r\nbridge, Ebbo turned away his head, groaned, and begged to hear no more of\r\neither.  He thought of his bold declaration that the bridge must be\r\nbuilt, even at the cost of blood!  Little did he then guess of whose\r\nblood!  And in his bitterness of spirit he felt a jealousy of that\r\ninfluence of Schleiermacher, which had of late come between him and his\r\nbrother.  He hated the very name, he said, and hid his face with a\r\nshudder.  He hoped the torrent would sweep away every fragment of the\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Ebbo mine, wherefore wish ill to a good work that our blessed one\r\nloved?  Listen, and let me tell you my dream for making yonder strand a\r\npeaceful memorial of our peaceful boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo honour Friedel?\xe2\x80\x9d and he gazed on her with something like interest in\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Ebbo, and as he would best brook honour.  Let us seek for ever to\r\nend the rival claims to yon piece of meadow by praying this knight of a\r\nreligious order, the new count, to unite with us in building there\xe2\x80\x94or as\r\nnear as may be safe\xe2\x80\x94a church of holy peace, and a cell for a priest, who\r\nmay watch over the bridge ward, and offer the holy sacrifice for the\r\ndeparted of either house.  There will we place our gentle Friedel to be\r\nthe first to guard the peace of the ford, and there will we sleep\r\nourselves when our time shall come, and so may the cruel feud of many\r\ngenerations be slaked for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn his blood!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cAh! would that it had been mine, mother.\r\nIt is well, as well as anything can be again.  So shall the spot where he\r\nfell be made sacred, and fenced from rude feet, and we shall see his fair\r\neffigy keeping his armed watch there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Christina was thankful to see his look of gratification, sad though\r\nit was.  She sat down near his bed, and began to write a letter in their\r\njoint names to Graf Dankwart von Schlangenwald, proposing that thus,\r\nafter the even balance of the wrongs of the two houses, their mutual\r\nhostility might be laid to rest for ever by the consecration of the cause\r\nof their long contention.  It was a stiff and formal letter, full of the\r\nset pious formularies of the age, scarcely revealing the deep\r\nheart-feeling within; but it was to the purpose, and Ebbo, after hearing\r\nit read, heartily approved, and consented to sign both it and those that\r\nSchleiermacher had brought.  Christina held the scroll, and placed the\r\npen in the fingers that had lately so easily wielded the heavy sword, but\r\nnow felt it a far greater effort to guide the slender quill.\r\n\r\nMoritz Schleiermacher went his way in search of the King of the Romans,\r\nfar off in Carinthia.  A full reply could not be expected till the\r\ncampaign was over, and all that was known for some time was through a\r\nmessenger sent back to Ulm by Schleiermacher with the intelligence that\r\nMaximilian would examine into the matter after his return, and that Count\r\nDankwart would reply when he should come to perform his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nobsequies after the army was dispersed.  There was also a letter of kind\r\nthough courtly condolence from Kasimir of Wildschloss, much grieving for\r\ngallant young Sir Friedmund, proffering all the advocacy he could give\r\nthe cause of Adlerstein, and covertly proffering the protection that she\r\nand her remaining son might now be more disposed to accept.  Christina\r\nsuppressed this letter, knowing it would only pain and irritate Ebbo, and\r\nthat she had her answer ready.  Indeed, in her grief for one son, and her\r\nanxiety for the other, perhaps it was this letter that first made her\r\nfully realize the drift of those earnest words of Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s respecting\r\nhis father.\r\n\r\nMeantime the mother and son were alone together, with much of suffering\r\nand of sorrow, yet with a certain tender comfort in the being all in all\r\nto one another, with none to intermeddle with their mutual love and\r\ngrief.  It was to Christina as if something of Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s sweetness had\r\npassed to his brother in his patient helplessness, and that, while thus\r\nfully engrossed with him, she had both her sons in one.  Nay, in spite of\r\nall the pain, grief, and weariness, these were times when both dreaded\r\nany change, and the full recovery, when not only would the loss of\r\nFriedel be every moment freshly brought home to his brother, but when\r\nEbbo would go in quest of his father.\r\n\r\nFor on this the young Baron had fixed his mind as a sacred duty, from the\r\nmoment he had seen that life was to be his lot.  He looked on his neglect\r\nof indications of the possibility of his father\xe2\x80\x99s life in the light of a\r\nsin that had led to all his disasters, and not only regarded the intended\r\nsearch as a token of repentance, but as a charge bequeathed to him by his\r\nless selfish brother.  He seldom spoke of his intention, but his mother\r\nwas perfectly aware of it, and never thought of it without such an agony\r\nof foreboding dread as eclipsed all the hope that lay beyond.  She could\r\nonly turn away her mind from the thought, and be thankful for what was\r\nstill her own from day to day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArt weary, my son?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Christina one October afternoon, as Ebbo lay\r\non his bed, languidly turning the pages of a noble folio of the Legends\r\nof the Saints that Master Gottfried had sent for his amusement.  It was\r\nsuch a book as fixed the ardour a few years later of the wounded\r\nNavarrese knight, Inigo de Loyola, but Ebbo handled it as if each page\r\nwere lead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly thinking how Friedel would have glowed towards these as his own\r\nkinsmen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cThen should I have cared to read of them!\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\ngave a long sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me take away the book,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.  \xe2\x80\x9cThou hast read long, and it is\r\ndark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo dark that there must surely be a snow-cloud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSnow is falling in the large flakes that our Friedel used to call\r\nwinter-butterflies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cButterflies that will swarm and shut us in from the weary world,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEbbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd alack! when they go, what a turmoil it will be!  Councils in\r\nthe Rathhaus, appeals to the League, wranglings with the Markgraf, wise\r\nsaws, overweening speeches, all alike dull and dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will scarce be so when strength and spirit have returned, mine Ebbo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever can life be more to me than the way to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lonely boy;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x94never like him\xe2\x80\x94shall miss the road without him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile he thus spoke in the listless dejection of sorrow and weakness,\r\nHatto\xe2\x80\x99s aged step was on the stair.  \xe2\x80\x9cGracious lady,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9chere is a\r\nhuntsman bewildered in the hills, who has been asking shelter from the\r\nstorm that is drifting up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee to his entertainment, then, Hatto,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lady\xe2\x80\x94Sir Baron,\xe2\x80\x9d added Hatto, \xe2\x80\x9cI had not come up but that this guest\r\nseems scarce gear for us below.  He is none of the foresters of our\r\ntract.  His hair is perfumed, his shirt is fine holland, his buff suit is\r\nof softest skin, his baldric has a jewelled clasp, and his arblast!  It\r\nwould do my lord baron\xe2\x80\x99s heart good only to cast eyes on the perfect make\r\nof that arblast!  He has a lordly tread, and a stately presence, and,\r\nthough he has a free tongue, and made friends with us as he dried his\r\ngarments, he asked after my lord like his equal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO mother, must you play the chatelaine?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cWho can the\r\nfellow be?  Why did none ever so come when they would have been more\r\nwelcome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWelcomed must he be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, rising, \xe2\x80\x9cand thy state shall be my\r\nexcuse for not tarrying longer with him than may be needful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYet, though shrinking from a stranger\xe2\x80\x99s face, she was not without hope\r\nthat the variety might wholesomely rouse her son from his depression, and\r\nin effect Ebbo, when left with Hatto, minutely questioned him on the\r\nappearance of the stranger, and watched, with much curiosity, for his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s return.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEbbo mine,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, entering, after a long interval, \xe2\x80\x9cthe knight asks\r\nto see thee either after supper, or to-morrow morn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen a knight he is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea, truly, a knight truly in every look and gesture, bearing his head\r\nlike the leading stag of the herd, and yet right gracious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGracious to you, mother, in your own hall?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ebbo, almost fiercely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! jealous champion, thou couldst not take offence!  It was the manner\r\nof one free and courteous to every one, and yet with an inherent\r\nloftiness that pervades all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGives he no name?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe calls himself Ritter Theurdank, of the suite of the late Kaisar, but\r\nI should deem him wont rather to lead than to follow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheurdank,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Eberhard, \xe2\x80\x9cI know no such name!  So, motherling,\r\nare you going to sup?  I shall not sleep till I have seen him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold, dear son.\xe2\x80\x9d  She leant over him and spoke low.  \xe2\x80\x9cSee him thou must,\r\nbut let me first station Heinz and Koppel at the door with halberts, not\r\nwithin earshot, but thou art so entirely defenceless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had the pleasure of seeing him laugh.  \xe2\x80\x9cLess defenceless than when\r\nthe kinsman of Wildschloss here visited us, mother?  I see for whom thou\r\ntakest him, but let it be so; a spiritual knight would scarce wreak his\r\nvengeance on a wounded man in his bed.  I will not have him insulted with\r\nprecautions.  If he has freely risked himself in my hands, I will as\r\nfreely risk myself in his.  Moreover, I thought he had won thy heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReigned over it, rather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is but the disguise that\r\nI suspect and mistrust.  Bid me not leave thee alone with him, my son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, dear mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9cthe matters on which he is like to speak\r\nwill brook no presence save our own, and even that will be hard enough to\r\nbear.  So prop me more upright!  So!  And comb out these locks somewhat\r\nsmoother.  Thanks, mother.  Now can he see whether he will choose\r\nEberhard of Adlerstein for friend or foe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy the time supper was ended, the only light in the upper room came from\r\nthe flickering flames of the fire of pine knots on the hearth.  It\r\nglanced on the pale features and dark sad eyes of the young Baron, sad in\r\nspite of the eager look of scrutiny that he turned on the figure that\r\nentered at the door, and approached so quickly that the partial light\r\nonly served to show the gloss of long fair hair, the glint of a jewelled\r\nbelt, and the outline of a tall, well-knit, agile frame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWelcome, Herr Ritter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry we have been unable to give\r\nyou a fitter reception.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo host could be more fully excused than you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, and\r\nEbbo started at his voice.  \xe2\x80\x9cI fear you have suffered much, and still\r\nhave much to suffer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sword wound is healing fast,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo; \xe2\x80\x9cit is the shot in my broken\r\nthigh that is so tedious and painful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I dare be sworn the leeches made it worse.  I have hated all leeches\r\never since they kept me three days a prisoner in a \xe2\x80\x99pothecary\xe2\x80\x99s shop\r\nstinking with drugs.  Why, I have cured myself with one pitcher of water\r\nof a raging fever, in their very despite!  How did they serve thee, my\r\npoor boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey poured hot oil into the wound to remove the venom of the lead,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Ebbo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad it been my case the lead should have been in their own brains first,\r\nthough that were scarce needed, the heavy-witted Hans Sausages.  Why\r\nshould there be more poison in lead than in steel?  I have asked all my\r\nsurgeons that question, nor ever had a reasonable answer.  Greater havoc\r\nof warriors do they make than ever with the arquebus\xe2\x80\x94ay, even when every\r\nlanzknecht bears one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlack!\xe2\x80\x9d Ebbo could not help exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere will be room for\r\nchivalry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalk not old world nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d said Theurdank; \xe2\x80\x9cchivalry is in the heart,\r\nnot in the weapon.  A youth beforehand enough with the world to be\r\nbuilding bridges should know that, when all our troops are provided with\r\nsuch an arm, then will their platoons in serried ranks be as a solid wall\r\nbreathing fire, and as impregnable as the lines of English archers with\r\nlong bows, or the phalanx of Macedon.  And, when each man bears a pistol\r\ninstead of the misericorde, his life will be far more his own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEbbo\xe2\x80\x99s face was in full light, and his visitor marked his contracted brow\r\nand trembling lip.  \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthou hast had foul experience of\r\nthese weapons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot mine own hurt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo; \xe2\x80\x9cthat was but fair chance of war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight; \xe2\x80\x9cit was the shot that severed the goodly\r\nbond that was so fair to see.  Young man, none has grieved more truly\r\nthan King Max.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd well he may,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe has not lost merely one of his best\r\nservants, but all the better half of another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is still stuff enough left to make that _one_ well worth having,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Theurdank, kindly grasping his hand, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I would it were more\r\nsubstantial!  How didst get old Wolfgang down, boy?  He must have been a\r\ntough morsel for slight bones like these, even when better covered than\r\nnow.  Come, tell me all.  I promised the Markgraf of Wurtemburg to look\r\ninto the matter when I came to be guest at St. Ruprecht\xe2\x80\x99s cloister, and I\r\nhave some small interest too with King Max.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis kindliness and sympathy were more effectual with Ebbo than the desire\r\nto represent his case favourably, for he was still too wretched to care\r\nfor policy; but he answered Theurdank\xe2\x80\x99s questions readily, and explained\r\nhow the idea of the bridge had originated in the vigil beside the broken\r\nwaggons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said Theurdank, \xe2\x80\x9cthe merchants made up thy share?  These\r\noverthrown goods are a seignorial right of one or other of you lords of\r\nthe bank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, Herr Ritter; but we deemed it unknightly to snatch at what\r\ntravellers lost by misfortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFreiherr Eberhard, take my word for it, while thou thus holdest, all the\r\narquebuses yet to be cut out of the Black Forest will not mar thy\r\nchivalry.  Where didst get these ways of thinking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother was a very St. Sebastian!  My mother\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! her sweet wise face would have shown it, even had not poor Kasimir\r\nof Adlerstein raved of her.  Ah! lad, thou hast crossed a case of true\r\nlove there!  Canst not brook even such a gallant stepfather?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, with spirit; \xe2\x80\x9cfor with his last breath\r\nSchlangenwald owned that my own father died not at the hostel, but may\r\nnow be alive as a Turkish slave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!\xe2\x80\x9d burst out Theurdank.  \xe2\x80\x9cWell! that might have been a pretty\r\nmess!  A Turkish slave, saidst thou!  What year chanced all this\r\nmatter\xe2\x80\x94thy grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s murder and all the rest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe year before my birth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt was in the September of\r\n1475.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Theurdank, musing to himself; \xe2\x80\x9cthat was the year the\r\ndotard Schenk got his overthrow at the fight of Rain on Sare from the\r\nMoslem.  Some composition was made by them, and old Wolfgang was not\r\nunlikely to have been the go-between.  So!  Say on, young knight,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9clet us to the matter in hand.  How rose the strife that kept back\r\ntwo troops from our\xe2\x80\x94from the banner of the empire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEbbo proceeded with the narration, and concluded it just as the bell now\r\nbelonging to the chapel began to toll for compline, and Theurdank\r\nprepared to obey its summons, first, however, asking if he should send\r\nany one to the patient.  Ebbo thanked him, but said he needed no one till\r\nhis mother should come after prayers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, I told thee I had some leechcraft.  Thou art weary, and must rest\r\nmore entirely;\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and, giving him little choice, Theurdank supported him\r\nwith one arm while removing the pillows that propped him, then laid him\r\ntenderly down, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cGood night, and the saints bless thee, brave\r\nyoung knight.  Sleep well, and recover in spite of the leeches.  I cannot\r\nafford to lose both of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEbbo strove to follow mentally the services that were being performed in\r\nthe chapel, and whose \xe2\x80\x9cAmens\xe2\x80\x9d and louder notes pealed up to him, devoid\r\nof the clear young tones that had sung their last here below, but swelled\r\nby grand bass notes that as much distracted Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s attention as the\r\nmemory of his guest\xe2\x80\x99s conversation; and he impatiently awaited his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s arrival.\r\n\r\nAt length, lamp in hand, she appeared with tears shining in her eyes, and\r\nbending over him said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe hath done honour to our blessed one, my Ebbo; he knelt by him, and\r\ncrossed him with holy water, and when he led me from the chapel he told\r\nme any mother in Germany might envy me my two sons even now.  Thou must\r\nlove him now, Ebbo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove him as one loves one\xe2\x80\x99s loftiest model,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cvalue the old\r\ncastle the more for sheltering him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHath he made himself known to thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot openly, but there is only one that he can be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristina smiled, thankful that the work of pardon and reconciliation had\r\nbeen thus softened by the personal qualities of the enemy, whose conduct\r\nin the chapel had deeply moved her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen all will be well, blessedly well,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I trust,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the bell broke our converse, and he laid me\r\ndown as tenderly as\xe2\x80\x94O mother, if a father\xe2\x80\x99s kindness be like his, I have\r\ntruly somewhat to regain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnew he aught of the fell bargain?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Christina.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot he, of course, save that it was a year of Turkish inroads.  He will\r\nspeak more perchance to-morrow.  Mother, not a word to any one, nor let\r\nus betray our recognition unless it be his pleasure to make himself\r\nknown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, remembering the danger that the\r\nhousehold might revenge Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s death if they knew the foe to be in\r\ntheir power.  Knowing as she did that Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s admiration was apt to be\r\nenthusiastic, and might now be rendered the more fervent by fever and\r\nsolitude, she was still at a loss to understand his dazzled, fascinated\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nWhen Heinz entered, bringing the castle key, which was always laid under\r\nthe Baron\xe2\x80\x99s pillow, Ebbo made a movement with his hand that surprised\r\nthem both, as if to send it elsewhere\xe2\x80\x94then muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, not till he\r\nreveals himself,\xe2\x80\x9d and asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere sleeps the guest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s room, which we fitted for a guest-chamber, little\r\nthinking who our first would be,\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever fear, lady; we will have a care to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heinz, somewhat\r\ngrimly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, have a care,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, wearily; \xe2\x80\x9cand take care all due honour is\r\nshown to him!  Good night, Heinz.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGracious lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heinz, when by a sign he had intimated to her his\r\ndesire of speaking with her unobserved by the Baron, \xe2\x80\x9cnever fear; I know\r\nwho the fellow is as well as you do.  I shall be at the foot of the\r\nstairs, and woe to whoever tries to step up them past me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no reason to apprehend treason, Heinz, yet to be on our guard\r\ncan do no harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, lady, I could look to the gear for the oubliette if you would speak\r\nthe word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, no, Heinz.  This man has come hither trusting to our\r\nhonour, and you could not do your lord a greater wrong, nor one that he\r\ncould less pardon, than by any attempt on our guest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould that he had never eaten our bread!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Heinz.  \xe2\x80\x9cVipers be\r\nthey all, and who knows what may come next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWatch, watch, Heinz; that is all,\xe2\x80\x9d implored Christina, \xe2\x80\x9cand, above all,\r\nnot a word to any one else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Christina dismissed the man-at-arms gruff and sullen, and herself\r\nretired ill at ease between fears of, and for, the unwelcome guest whose\r\nstrange powers of fascination had rendered her, in his absence, doubly\r\ndistrustful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\nRITTER THEURDANK\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE snow fell all night without ceasing, and was still falling on the\r\nmorrow, when the guest explained his desire of paying a short visit to\r\nthe young Baron, and then taking his departure.  Christina would gladly\r\nhave been quit of him, but she felt bound to remonstrate, for their\r\nmountain was absolutely impassable during a fall of snow, above all when\r\naccompanied by wind, since the drifts concealed fearful abysses, and the\r\nshifting masses insured destruction to the unwary wayfarer; nay, natives\r\nthemselves had perished between the hamlet and the castle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the hardiest cragsman, not my son himself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9ccould venture\r\non such a morning to guide you to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhither, gracious dame?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Theurdank, half smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, sir, I would not utter what you would not make known.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know me then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely, sir, for our noble foe, whose generous trust in our honour must\r\nwin my son\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a peculiar smile, \xe2\x80\x9cTheurdank\xe2\x80\x94Dankwart\xe2\x80\x94I see!  May I\r\nask if your son likewise smelt out the Schlangenwald?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVerily, Sir Count, my Ebbo is not easily deceived.  He said our guest\r\ncould be but one man in all the empire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheurdank smiled again, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThen, lady, you shudder not at a man\r\nwhose kin and yours have shed so much of one another\xe2\x80\x99s blood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, ghostly knight, I regard you as no more stained therewith than are\r\nmy sons by the deeds of their grandfather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there were more like you, lady,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Theurdank, \xe2\x80\x9cdeadly feuds\r\nwould soon be starved out.  May I to your son?  I have more to say to\r\nhim, and I would fain hear his views of the storm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristina could not be quite at ease with Theurdank in her son\xe2\x80\x99s room,\r\nbut she had no choice, and she knew that Heinz was watching on the turret\r\nstair, out of hearing indeed, but as ready to spring as a cat who sees\r\nher young ones in the hand of a child that she only half trusts.\r\n\r\nEbbo lay eagerly watching for his visitor, who greeted him with the same\r\nalmost paternal kindness he had evinced the night before, but consulted\r\nhim upon the way from the castle.  Ebbo confirmed his mother\xe2\x80\x99s opinion\r\nthat the path was impracticable so long as the snow fell, and the wind\r\ntossed it in wild drifts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been caught in snow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand hard work have we had to get\r\nhome!  Once indeed, after a bear hunt, we fully thought the castle stood\r\nbefore us, and lo! it was all a cruel snow mist in that mocking shape.  I\r\nwas even about to climb our last Eagle\xe2\x80\x99s Step, as I thought, when behold,\r\nit proved to be the very brink of the abyss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! these ravines are well-nigh as bad as those of the Inn.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve known\r\nwhat it was to be caught on the ledge of a precipice by a sharp wind,\r\nchanging its course, mark\xe2\x80\x99st thou, so swiftly that it verily tore my hold\r\nfrom the rock, and had well-nigh swept me into a chasm of mighty depth.\r\nThere was nothing for it but to make the best spring I might towards the\r\ncrag on the other side, and grip for my life at my alpenstock, which by\r\nOur Lady\xe2\x80\x99s grace was firmly planted, and I held on till I got breath\r\nagain, and felt for my footing on the ice-glazed rock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eberhard with a long breath, after having listened with a\r\nhunter\xe2\x80\x99s keen interest to this hair\xe2\x80\x99s-breadth escape, \xe2\x80\x9cit sounds like a\r\ngust of my mountain air thus let in on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly it is dismal work for a lusty hunter to lie here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Theurdank,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut soon shalt thou take thy crags again in full vigour, I hope.  How\r\ncall\xe2\x80\x99st thou the deep gray lonely pool under a steep frowning crag\r\nsharpened well-nigh to a spear point, that I passed yester afternoon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Ptarmigan\xe2\x80\x99s Mere, the Red Eyrie,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Ebbo, scarcely able to\r\nutter the words as he thought of Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s delight in the pool, his\r\nexploit at the eyrie, and the gay bargain made in the streets of Ulm,\r\nthat he should show the scaler of the Dom steeple the way to the eagle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember,\xe2\x80\x9d said his guest gravely, coming to his side.  \xe2\x80\x9cAh, boy! thy\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s flight has been higher yet.  Weep freely; fear me not.  Do I\r\nnot know what it is, when those who were over-good for earth have found\r\ntheir eagle\xe2\x80\x99s wings, and left us here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEbbo gazed up through his tears into the noble, mournful face that was\r\nbent kindly over him.  \xe2\x80\x9cI will not seek to comfort thee by counselling\r\nthee to forget,\xe2\x80\x9d said Theurdank.  \xe2\x80\x9cI was scarce thine elder when my life\r\nwas thus rent asunder, and to hoar hairs, nay, to the grave itself, will\r\nshe be my glory and my sorrow.  Never owned I brother, but I trow ye two\r\nwere one in no common sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch brothers as we saw at Ulm were little like us,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Ebbo, from\r\nthe bottom of his heart.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe were knit together so that all will begin\r\nwith me as if it were the left hand remaining alone to do it!  I am glad\r\nthat my old life may not even in shadow be renewed till after I have gone\r\nin quest of my father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe not over hasty in that quest,\xe2\x80\x9d said the guest, \xe2\x80\x9cor the infidels may\r\nchance to gain two Freiherren instead of one.  Hast any designs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEbbo explained that he thought of making his way to Genoa to consult the\r\nmerchant Gian Battista dei Battiste, whose description of the captive\r\nGerman noble had so strongly impressed Friedel.  Ebbo knew the difference\r\nbetween Turks and Moors, but Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s impulse guided him, and he further\r\nthought that at Genoa he should learn the way to deal with either variety\r\nof infidel.  Theurdank thought this a prudent course, since the Genoese\r\nhad dealings both at Tripoli and Constantinople; and, moreover, the\r\ntransfer was not impossible, since the two different hordes of Moslems\r\ntrafficked among themselves when either had made an unusually successful\r\nrazzia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShame,\xe2\x80\x9d he broke out, \xe2\x80\x9cthat these Eastern locusts, these ravening\r\nhounds, should prey unmolested on the fairest lands of the earth, and our\r\nGerman nobles lie here like swine, grunting and squealing over the\r\nplunder they grub up from one another, deaf to any summons from heaven or\r\nearth!  Did not Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s own voice speak in thunder this last year, even\r\nin November, hurling the mighty thunderbolt of Alsace, an ell long,\r\nweighing two hundred and fifteen pounds?  Did I not cause it to be hung\r\nup in the church of Encisheim, as a witness and warning of the plagues\r\nthat hang over us?  But no, nothing will quicken them from their sloth\r\nand drunkenness till the foe are at their doors; and, if a man arise of\r\ndifferent mould, with some heart for the knightly, the good, and the\r\ntrue, then they kill him for me!  But thou, Adlerstein, this pious quest\r\nover, thou wilt return to me.  Thou hast head to think and heart to feel\r\nfor the shame and woe of this misguided land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI trust so, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cTruly, I have suffered bitterly for\r\npursuing my own quarrel rather than the crusade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI meant not thee,\xe2\x80\x9d said Theurdank, kindly.  \xe2\x80\x9cThy bridge is a benefit to\r\nme, as much as, or more than, ever it can be to thee.  Dost know Italian?\r\nThere is something of Italy in thine eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother\xe2\x80\x99s mother was Italian, my lord; but she died so early that her\r\nlanguage has not descended to my mother or myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou shouldst learn it.  It will be pastime while thou art bed-fast, and\r\nserve thee well in dealing with the Moslem.  Moreover, I may have work\r\nfor thee in Welschland.  Books?  I will send thee books.  There is the\r\nwhole chronicle of Karl the Great, and all his Palsgrafen, by Pulci and\r\nBoiardo, a brave Count and gentleman himself, governor of Reggio, and\r\nworthy to sing of deeds of arms; so choice, too, as to the names of his\r\nheroes, that they say he caused his church bells to be rung when he had\r\nfound one for Rodomonte, his infidel Hector.  He has shown up Roland as a\r\nlove-sick knight, though, which is out of all accord with Archbishop\r\nTurpin.  Wilt have him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we were together, we used to love tales of chivalry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!  Or wilt have the stern old Ghibelline Florentine, who explored the\r\nthree realms of the departed?  Deep lore, and well-nigh unsearchable, is\r\nhis; but I love him for the sake of his Beatrice, who guided him.  May we\r\nfind such guides in our day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard of him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf he will tell me where my Friedel\r\nwalks in light, then, my lord, I would read him with all my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr wouldst thou have rare Franciscus Petrarca?  I wot thou art too young\r\nas yet for the yearnings of his sonnets, but their voice is sweet to the\r\nbereft heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he murmured over, in their melodious Italian flow, the lines on\r\nLaura\xe2\x80\x99s death:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cNot pallid, but yet whiter than the snow\r\n    By wind unstirred that on a hillside lies;\r\n    Rest seemed as on a weary frame to grow,\r\n    A gentle slumber pressed her lovely eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he added aloud to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cit is ever to me as though the poet had\r\nwatched in that chamber at Ghent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch were the discourses of that morning, now on poetry and book lore;\r\nnow admiration of the carvings that decked the room; now talk on grand\r\narchitectural designs, or improvements in fire-arms, or the discussion of\r\nhunting adventures.  There seemed nothing in art, life, or learning in\r\nwhich the versatile mind of Theurdank was not at home, or that did not\r\nend in some strange personal reminiscence of his own.  All was so kind,\r\nso gracious, and brilliant, that at first the interview was full of\r\nwondering delight to Ebbo, but latterly it became very fatiguing from the\r\nstrain of attention, above all towards a guest who evidently knew that he\r\nwas known, while not permitting such recognition to be avowed.  Ebbo\r\nbegan to long for an interruption, but, though he could see by the\r\nlightened sky that the weather had cleared up, it would have been\r\nimpossible to have suggested to any guest that the way might now probably\r\nbe open, and more especially to such a guest as this.  Considerate as his\r\nvisitor had been the night before, the pleasure of talk seemed to have\r\ndone away with the remembrance of his host\xe2\x80\x99s weakness, till Ebbo so\r\nflagged that at last he was scarcely alive to more than the continued\r\nsound of the voice, and all the pain that for a while had been in\r\nabeyance seemed to have mastered him; but his guest, half reading his\r\nbooks, half discoursing, seemed too much immersed in his own plans,\r\ntheories, and adventures, to mark the condition of his auditor.\r\n\r\nInterruption came at last, however.  There was a sudden knock at the door\r\nat noon, and with scant ceremony Heinz entered, followed by three other\r\nof the men-at-arms, fully equipped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! what means this?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Ebbo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace, Sir Baron,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heinz, advancing so as to place his large person\r\nbetween Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s bed and the strange hunter.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou know nothing of it.  We\r\nare not going to lose you as well as your brother, and we mean to see how\r\nthis knight likes to serve as a hostage instead of opening the gates as a\r\ntraitor spy.  On him, Koppel! it is thy right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHands off! at your peril, villains!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ebbo, sitting up, and\r\nspeaking in the steady resolute voice that had so early rendered him\r\nthoroughly their master, but much perplexed and dismayed, and entirely\r\nunassisted by Theurdank, who stood looking on with almost a smile, as if\r\ndiverted by his predicament.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy your leave, Herr Freiherr,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heinz, putting his hand on his\r\nshoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is no concern of yours.  While you cannot guard yourself\r\nor my lady, it is our part to do so.  I tell you his minions are on their\r\nway to surprise the castle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven as Heinz spoke, Christina came panting into the room, and, hurrying\r\nto her son\xe2\x80\x99s side, said, \xe2\x80\x9cSir Count, is this just, is this honourable,\r\nthus to return my son\xe2\x80\x99s welcome, in his helpless condition?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, are you likewise distracted?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is all this\r\nmadness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, my son, it is no frenzy!  There are armed men coming up the\r\nEagle\xe2\x80\x99s Stairs on the one hand and by the Gemsbock\xe2\x80\x99s Pass on the other!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not a hair of your head shall they hurt, lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heinz.  \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\nfellow\xe2\x80\x99s limbs shall be thrown to them over the battlements.  On,\r\nKoppel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOff, Koppel!\xe2\x80\x9d thundered Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cWould you brand me with shame for ever?\r\nWere he all the Schlangenwalds in one, he should go as freely as he came;\r\nbut he is no more Schlangenwald than I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has deceived you, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heinz.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy lady\xe2\x80\x99s own letter to\r\nSchlangenwald was in his chamber.  \xe2\x80\x99Tis a treacherous disguise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFool that thou art!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cI know this gentleman well.  I knew\r\nhim at Ulm.  Those who meet him here mean me no ill.  Open the gates and\r\nreceive them honourably!  Mother, mother, trust me, all is well.  I know\r\nwhat I am saying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe men looked one upon another.  Christina wrung her hands, uncertain\r\nwhether her son were not under some strange fatal deception.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord has his fancies,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Koppel.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll not be balked of my\r\nright of vengeance for his scruples!  Will he swear that this fellow is\r\nwhat he calls himself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he is a true loyal knight, well known\r\nto me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwear it distinctly, Sir Baron,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heinz.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe have all too deep a\r\ndebt of vengeance to let off any one who comes here lurking in the\r\ninterest of our foe.  Swear that this is Theurdank, or we send his head\r\nto greet his friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDrops stood on Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s brow, and his breath laboured as he felt his senses\r\nreeling, and his powers of defence for his guest failing him.  Even\r\nshould the stranger confess his name, the people of the castle might not\r\nbelieve him; and here he stood like one indifferent, evidently measuring\r\nhow far his young host would go in his cause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot swear that his real name is Theurdank,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, rallying his\r\nforces, \xe2\x80\x9cbut this I swear, that he is neither friend nor fosterer of\r\nSchlangenwald, that I know him, and I had rather die than that the\r\nslightest indignity were offered him.\xe2\x80\x9d  Here, and with a great effort\r\nthat terribly wrenched his wounded leg, he reached past Heinz, and\r\ngrasped his guest\xe2\x80\x99s hand, pulling him as near as he could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cif they try to lay hands on you, strike my death-blow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA bugle-horn was wound outside.  The men stood daunted\xe2\x80\x94Christina in\r\nextreme terror for her son, who lay gasping, breathless, but still\r\nclutching the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and with eyes of fire glaring on the\r\nmutinous warriors.  Another bugle-blast!  Heinz was almost in the act of\r\ngrappling with the silent foe, and Koppel cried as he raised his halbert,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow or never!\xe2\x80\x9d but paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, so please you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the strange guest.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat if your young lord\r\ncould not forswear himself that my name is Theurdank!  Are you foes to\r\nall the world save Theurdank?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo masking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heinz, sternly.  \xe2\x80\x9cTell your true name as an honest\r\nman, and we will judge whether you be friend or foe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name is a mouthful, as your master knows,\xe2\x80\x9d said the guest, slowly,\r\nlooking with strangely amused eyes on the confused lanzknechts, who were\r\ntrying to devour their rage.  \xe2\x80\x9cI was baptized Maximilianus; Archduke of\r\nAustria, by birth; by choice of the Germans, King of the Romans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Kaisar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristina dropped on her knee; the men-at-arms tumbled backwards; Ebbo\r\npressed the hand he held to his lips, and fainted away.  The bugle\r\nsounded for the third time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\nPEACE\r\n\r\n\r\nSLOWLY and painfully did Ebbo recover from his swoon, feeling as if the\r\nmeans of revival were rending him away from his brother.  He was so\r\ncompletely spent that he was satisfied with a mere assurance that nothing\r\nwas amiss, and presently dropped into a profound slumber, whence he awoke\r\nto find it still broad daylight, and his mother sitting by the side of\r\nhis bed, all looking so much as it had done for the last six weeks, that\r\nhis first inquiry was if all that had happened had been but a strange\r\ndream.  His mother would scarcely answer till she had satisfied herself\r\nthat his eye was clear, his voice steady, his hand cool, and that, as she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cThat Kaisar had done him no harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, then it was true!  Where is he?  Gone?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ebbo, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, in the hall below, busy with letters they have brought him.  Lie\r\nstill, my boy; he has done thee quite enough damage for one day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, mother, what are you saying!  Something disloyal, was it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Ebbo, I was very angry that he should have half killed you when he\r\ncould so easily have spoken one word.  Heaven forgive me if I did wrong,\r\nbut I could not help it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid _he_ forgive you, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x94oh yes.  To do him justice he was greatly concerned; devised ways of\r\nrestoring thee, and now has promised not to come near thee again without\r\nmy leave,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother, quite as persuaded of her own rightful sway\r\nin her son\xe2\x80\x99s sick chamber as ever Kunigunde had been of her dominion over\r\nthe castle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is he displeased with me?  Those cowardly vindictive rascals, to\r\nfall on him, and set me at nought!  Before him, too!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ebbo,\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Ebbo, he thought thy part most gallant.  I heard him say so, not\r\nonly to me, but below stairs\xe2\x80\x94both wise and true.  Thou didst know him\r\nthen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the first glance of his princely eye\xe2\x80\x94the first of his keen smiles.\r\nI had seen him disguised before.  I thought you knew him too, mother; I\r\nnever guessed that your mind was running on Schlangenwald when we talked\r\nat cross purposes last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould that I had; but though I breathed no word openly, I encouraged\r\nHeinz\xe2\x80\x99s precautions.  My boy, I could not help it; my heart would tremble\r\nfor my only one, and I saw he could not be what he seemed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what doth he here?  Who were the men who were advancing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were the followers he had left at St. Ruprecht\xe2\x80\x99s, and likewise\r\nMaster Schleiermacher and Sir Kasimir of Wildschloss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94he had not told thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.  He knew that I knew him, was at no pains to disguise himself, yet\r\nevidently meant me to treat him as a private knight.  But what brought\r\nWildschloss here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, \xe2\x80\x9cthat, on the return from Carinthia, the\r\nKaisar expressed his intention of slipping away from his army in his own\r\nstrange fashion, and himself inquiring into the matter of the Ford.  So\r\nhe took with him his own personal followers, the new Graf von\r\nSchlangenwald, Herr Kasimir, and Master Schleiermacher.  The others he\r\nsent to Schlangenwald; he himself lodged at St. Ruprecht\xe2\x80\x99s, appointing\r\nthat Sir Kasimir should meet him there this morning.  From the convent he\r\nstarted on a chamois hunt, and made his way hither; but, when the snow\r\ncame on, and he returned not, his followers became uneasy, and came in\r\nsearch of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9che meant to intercede for Wildschloss\xe2\x80\x94it might be he\r\nwould have tried his power.  No, for that he is too generous.  How looked\r\nWildschloss, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could I tell how any one looked save thee, my poor wan boy?  Thou\r\nart paler than ever!  I cannot have any king or kaisar of them all come\r\nto trouble thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, motherling, there is much more trouble and unrest to me in not\r\nknowing how my king will treat us after such a requital!  Prithee let him\r\nknow that I am at his service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, after having fed and refreshed her patient, the gentle potentate of\r\nhis chamber consented to intimate her consent to admit the invader.  But\r\nnot till after delay enough to fret the impatient nerves of illness did\r\nMaximilian appear, handing her in, and saying, in the cheery voice that\r\nwas one of his chief fascinations,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea, truly, fair dame, I know thou wouldst sooner trust Schlangenwald\r\nhimself than me alone with thy charge.  How goes it, my true knight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, right well, my liege,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9csave for my shame and grief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art the last to be ashamed for that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the good-natured prince.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I never seen my faithful vassals more bent on their own feuds than\r\non my word?\xe2\x80\x94I who reign over a set of kings, who brook no will but their\r\nown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd may we ask your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9cnot only for ourselves, but for\r\nthe misguided men-at-arms?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! the grewsome giant that was prepared with the axe, and the honest\r\nlad that wanted to do his duty by his father?  I honour that lad,\r\nFreiherr; I would enrol him in my guard, but that probably he is better\r\noff here than with _Massimiliano pochi danari_, as the Italians call me.\r\nBut what I came hither to say was this,\xe2\x80\x9d and he spoke gravely: \xe2\x80\x9cthou art\r\nsincere in desiring reconciliation with the house of Schlangenwald?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9cdo I loathe the miserable debt of blood\r\nfor blood!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maximilian, \xe2\x80\x9cGraf Dankwart is of like mind.  Bred from\r\npagedom in his Prussian commandery, he has never been exposed to the\r\nirritations that have fed the spirit of strife, and he will be thankful\r\nto lay it aside.  The question next is how to solemnize this\r\nreconciliation, ere your retainers on one side or the other do something\r\nto set you by the ears together again, which, judging by this morning\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork, is not improbable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas! no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9cwhile I am laid by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad you both been in our camp, you should have sworn friendship in my\r\nchapel.  Now must Dankwart come hither to thee, as I trow he had best do,\r\nwhile I am here to keep the peace.  See, friend Ebbo, we will have him\r\nhere to-morrow; thy chaplain shall deck the altar here, the Father Abbot\r\nshall say mass, and ye shall swear peace and brotherhood before me.\r\nAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, taking Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s hand, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall know how to trust thine\r\noaths as of one who sets the fear of God above that of his king.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was truly the only chance of impressing on the wild vassals of the\r\ntwo houses an obligation that perhaps might override their ancient\r\nhatred; and the Baron and his mother gladly submitted to the arrangement.\r\nMaximilian withdrew to give directions for summoning the persons required\r\nand Christina was soon obliged to leave her son, while she provided for\r\nher influx of guests.\r\n\r\nEbbo was alone till nearly the end of the supper below stairs.  He had\r\nbeen dozing, when a cautious tread came up the turret steps, and he\r\nstarted, and called out, \xe2\x80\x9cWho goes there?  I am not asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is your kinsman, Freiherr,\xe2\x80\x9d said a well-known voice; \xe2\x80\x9cI come by your\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s leave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWelcome, Sir Cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, holding out his hand.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou come to\r\nfind everything changed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have knelt in the chapel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildschloss, gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he loved you better than I!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour jealousy of me was a providential thing, for which all may be\r\nthankful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildschloss gravely; \xe2\x80\x9cyet it is no small thing to lose\r\nthe hope of so many years!  However, young Baron, I have grave matter for\r\nyour consideration.  Know you the service on which I am to be sent?  The\r\nKaisar deems that the Armenians or some of the Christian nations on the\r\nskirts of the Ottoman empire might be made our allies, and attack the\r\nTurk in his rear.  I am chosen as his envoy, and shall sail so soon as I\r\ncan make my way to Venice.  I only knew of the appointment since I came\r\nhither, he having been led thereto by letters brought him this day; and\r\nmayhap by the downfall of my hopes.  He was peremptory, as his mood is,\r\nand seemed to think it no small favour,\xe2\x80\x9d added Wildschloss, with some\r\nannoyance.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd meantime, what of my poor child?  There she is in the\r\ncloister at Ulm, but an inheritance is a very mill-stone round the neck\r\nof an orphan maid.  That insolent fellow, Lassla von Trautbach, hath\r\nalready demanded to espouse the poor babe; he\xe2\x80\x94a blood-stained, dicing,\r\ndrunken rover, with whom I would not trust a dog that I loved!  Yet my\r\ndeath would place her at the disposal of his father, who would give her\r\nat once to him.  Nay, even his aunt, the abbess, will believe nothing\r\nagainst him, and hath even striven with me to have her betrothed at once.\r\nOn the barest rumour of my death will they wed the poor little thing, and\r\nthen woe to her, and woe to my vassals!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe King,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cSurely she might be made his ward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Kasimir, bending over him, and speaking in an\r\nundertone, \xe2\x80\x9che may well have won your heart.  As friend, when one is at\r\nhis side, none can be so winning, or so sincere as he; but with all his\r\nbrilliant gifts, he says truly of himself that he is a mere reckless\r\nhuntsman.  To-day, while I am with him, he would give me half Austria, or\r\nfight single-handed in my cause or Thekla\xe2\x80\x99s.  Next month, when I am out\r\nof sight, comes Trautbach, just when his head is full of keeping the\r\nFrench out of Italy, or reforming the Church, or beating the Turk, or\r\nparcelling the empire into circles, or, maybe, of a new touch-hole for a\r\ncannon\xe2\x80\x94nay, of a flower-garden, or of walking into a lion\xe2\x80\x99s den.  He just\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x98Yea, well,\xe2\x80\x99 to be rid of the importunity, and all is over with my\r\npoor little maiden.  Hare-brained and bewildered with schemes has he been\r\nas Romish King\xe2\x80\x94how will it be with him as Kaisar?  It is but of his\r\nwonted madness that he is here at all, when his Austrian states must be\r\nall astray for want of him.  No, no; I would rather make a weathercock\r\nguardian to my daughter.  You yourself are the only guard to whom I can\r\nsafely intrust her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sword as knight and kinsman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d began Ebbo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; \xe2\x80\x99tis no matter of errant knight or distressed damsel.  That is\r\nKing Max\xe2\x80\x99s own line!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildschloss, with a little of the irony that\r\nused to nettle Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere is only one way in which you can save her,\r\nand that is as her husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEbbo started, as well he might, but Sir Kasimir laid his hand on him with\r\na gesture that bade him listen ere he spoke.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy first wish for my\r\nchild,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwas to see her brought up by that peerless lady below\r\nstairs.  The saints\xe2\x80\x94in pity to one so like themselves\xe2\x80\x94spared her the\r\ndistress our union would have brought her.  Now, it would be vain to\r\nplace my little Thekla in her care, for Trautbach would easily feign my\r\ndeath, and claim his niece, nor are you of age to be made her guardian as\r\nhead of our house.  But, if this marriage rite were solemnized, then\r\nwould her person and lands alike be yours, and I could leave her with an\r\neasy heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said the confused, surprised Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat can I do?  They say I\r\nshall not walk for many weeks to come.  And, even if I could, I am so\r\nyoung\xe2\x80\x94I have so blundered in my dealings with my own mountaineers, and\r\nwith this fatal bridge\xe2\x80\x94how should I manage such estates as yours?  Some\r\nbetter\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook you, Ebbo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildschloss; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have erred\xe2\x80\x94you have been hasty;\r\nbut tell me where to find another youth, whose strongest purpose was as\r\nwise as your errors, or who cared for others\xe2\x80\x99 good more than for his own\r\nviolence and vainglory?  Brief as your time has been, one knows when one\r\nis on your bounds by the aspect of your serfs, the soundness of their\r\ndwellings, the prosperity of their crops and cattle above all, by their\r\nface and tone if one asks for their lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! it was Friedel they loved.  They scarce knew me from Friedel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch as you are, with all the blunders you have made and will make, you\r\nare the only youth I know to whom I could intrust my child or my lands.\r\nThe old Wildschloss castle is a male fief, and would return to you, but\r\nthere are domains since granted that will cause intolerable trouble and\r\nstrife, unless you and my poor little heiress are united.  As for age,\r\nyou are\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEighteen next Easter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen there are scarce eleven years between you.  You will find the\r\nlittle one a blooming bride when your first deeds in arms have been\r\nfought out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, if my mother trains her up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, thoughtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cshe will be\r\nall the better daughter to her.  But, Sir Cousin, you know I too must be\r\ngoing.  So soon as I can brook the saddle, I must seek out and ransom my\r\nfather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is like to be a far shorter and safer journey than mine.  The\r\nGenoese and Venetians understand traffic with the infidels for their\r\ncaptives, and only by your own fault could you get into danger.  Even at\r\nthe worst, should mishap befall you, you could so order matters as to\r\nleave your girl-widow in your mother\xe2\x80\x99s charge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d added Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9cshe would still have one left to love and cherish\r\nher.  Sir Kasimir, it is well; though, if you knew me without my Friedel,\r\nyou would repent of your bargain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks from my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildschloss, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you need not be concerned.\r\nYou have never been over-friendly with me even with Friedel at your side.\r\nBut to business, my son.  You will endure that title from me now?  My\r\ntime is short.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you have me do?  Shall I send the little one a betrothal\r\nring, and ride to Ulm to wed and fetch her home in spring?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may hardly serve.  These kinsmen would have seized on her and the\r\ncastle long ere that time.  The only safety is the making wedlock as fast\r\nas it can be made with a child of such tender years.  Mine is the only\r\npower that can make the abbess give her up, and therefore will I ride\r\nthis moonlight night to Ulm, bring the little one back with me by the\r\ntime the reconciliation be concluded, and then shall ye be wed by the\r\nAbbot of St. Ruprecht\xe2\x80\x99s, with the Kaisar for a witness, and thus will the\r\nknot be too strong for the Trautbachs to untie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEbbo looked disconcerted, and gasped, as if this were over-quick\r\nwork.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \xe2\x80\x9cKnows my mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI go to speak with her at once.  The Kaisar\xe2\x80\x99s consent I have, as he\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x98If we have one vassal who has common sense and honesty, let us\r\nmake the most of him.\xe2\x80\x99  Ah! my son, I shall return to see you his\r\ncounsellor and friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose days had no delicacies as to the lady\xe2\x80\x99s side taking the initiative:\r\nand, in effect, the wealth and power of Wildschloss so much exceeded\r\nthose of the elder branch that it would have been presumptuous on\r\nEberhard\xe2\x80\x99s part to have made the proposal.  It was more a treaty than an\r\naffair of hearts, and Sir Kasimir had not even gone through the form of\r\ninquiring if Ebbo were fancy-free.  It was true, indeed, that he was\r\nstill a boy, with no passion for any one but his mother; but had he even\r\nformed a dream of a ladye love, it would scarcely have been deemed a\r\nrational objection.  The days of romance were no days of romance in\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nYet Christina, wedded herself for pure love, felt this obstacle strongly.\r\nThe scheme was propounded to her over the hall fire by no less a person\r\nthan Maximilian himself, and he, whose perceptions were extremely keen\r\nwhen he was not too much engrossed to use them, observed her reluctance\r\nthrough all her timid deference, and probed her reasons so successfully\r\nthat she owned at last that, though it might sound like folly, she could\r\nscarce endure to see her son so bind himself that the romance of his life\r\ncould hardly be innocent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, lady,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer, in a tone of deep feeling.  \xe2\x80\x9cNeither lands\r\nnor honours can weigh down the up-springing of true love;\xe2\x80\x9d and he bowed\r\nhis head between his hands.\r\n\r\nVerily, all the Low Countries had not impeded the true-hearted affection\r\nof Maximilian and Mary; and, though since her death his want of\r\nself-restraint had marred his personal character and morals, and though\r\nhe was now on the point of concluding a most loveless political marriage,\r\nyet still Mary was\xe2\x80\x94as he shows her as the Beatrice of both his strange\r\nautobiographical allegories\xe2\x80\x94the guiding star of his fitful life; and in\r\nheart his fidelity was so unbroken that, when after a long pause he again\r\nlooked up to Christina, he spoke as well understanding her feelings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what you would say, lady; your son hardly knows as yet how much\r\nis asked of him, and the little maid, to whom he vows his heart, is\r\nover-young to secure it.  But, lady, I have often observed that men,\r\nwhose family affections are as deep and fervent as your son\xe2\x80\x99s are for you\r\nand his brother, seldom have wandering passions, but that their love\r\nflows deep and steady in the channels prepared for it.  Let your young\r\nFreiherr regard this damsel as his own, and you will see he will love her\r\nas such.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI trust so, my liege.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoreover, if she turn out like the spiteful Trautbach folk,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMaximilian, rather wickedly, \xe2\x80\x9cplenty of holes can be picked in a\r\nbaby-wedding.  No fear of its over-firmness.  I never saw one come to\r\ngood; only he must keep firm hold on the lands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was not easy to answer, coming from a prince who had no small\r\nexperience in premature bridals coming to nothing, and Christina felt\r\nthat the matter was taken out of her hands, and that she had no more to\r\ndo but to enjoy the warm-hearted Kaisar\xe2\x80\x99s praises of her son.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the general run of nobles were then so boorish and violent\r\ncompared with the citizens, that a nobleman who possessed intellect,\r\nloyalty, and conscience was so valuable to the sovereign that Maximilian\r\nwas rejoiced to do all that either could bind him to his service or\r\nincrease his power.  The true history of this expedition on the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npart was this\xe2\x80\x94that he had consulted Kasimir upon the question of the\r\nDebateable Ford and the feud of Adlerstein and Schlangenwald, asking\r\nfurther how his friend had sped in the wooing of the fair widow, to which\r\nhe remembered having given his consent at Ulm.\r\n\r\nWildschloss replied that, though backed up by her kindred at Ulm, he had\r\nmade no progress in consequence of the determined opposition of her two\r\nsons, and he had therefore resolved to wait a while, and let her and the\r\nyoung Baron feel their inability to extricate themselves from the\r\ndifficulties that were sure to beset them, without his authority,\r\ninfluence, and experience\xe2\x80\x94fully believing that some predicament might\r\narise that would bring the mother to terms, if not the sons.\r\n\r\nThis disaster did seem to have fallen out, and he had meant at once to\r\noffer himself to the lady as her supporter and advocate, able to bring\r\nabout all her son could desire; though he owned that his hopes would have\r\nbeen higher if the survivor had been the gentle, friendly Friedmund,\r\nrather than the hot and imperious Eberhard, who he knew must be brought\r\nvery low ere his objections would be withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe touch of romance had quite fascinated Maximilian.  He would see the\r\nlady and her son.  He would make all things easy by the personal\r\ninfluence that he so well knew how to exert, backed by his imperial\r\nauthority; and both should see cause to be thankful to purchase consent\r\nto the bridge-building, and pardon for the fray, by the marriage between\r\nthe widow and Sir Kasimir.\r\n\r\nBut the Last of the Knights was a gentleman, and the meek dignity of his\r\nhostess had hindered him from pressing on her any distasteful subject\r\nuntil her son\xe2\x80\x99s explanation of the uncertainty of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s death had\r\nprecluded all mention of this intention.  Besides, Maximilian was himself\r\ngreatly charmed by Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s own qualities\xe2\x80\x94partly perhaps as an intelligent\r\nauditor, but also by his good sense, high spirit, and, above all, by the\r\nready and delicate tact that had both penetrated and respected the\r\ndisguise.  Moreover, Maximilian, though a faulty, was a devout man, and\r\ncould appreciate the youth\xe2\x80\x99s unswerving truth, under circumstances that\r\ndid, in effect, imperil him more really than his guest.  In this mood,\r\nMaximilian felt disposed to be rid to the very utmost of poor Sir\r\nKasimir\xe2\x80\x99s unlucky attachment to a wedded lady; and receiving letters\r\nsuggestive of the Eastern mission, instantly decided that it would only\r\nbe doing as he would be done by instantly to order the disappointed\r\nsuitor off to the utmost parts of the earth, where he would much have\r\nliked to go himself, save for the unlucky clog of all the realm of\r\nGermany.  That Sir Kasimir had any tie to home he had for the moment\r\nentirely forgotten; and, had he remembered it, the knight was so\r\neminently fitted to fulfil his purpose, that it could hardly have been\r\nregarded.  But, when Wildschloss himself devised his little heiress\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunion with the head of the direct line, it was a most acceptable proposal\r\nto the Emperor, who set himself to forward it at once, out of policy, and\r\nas compensation to all parties.\r\n\r\nAnd so Christina\xe2\x80\x99s gentle remonstrance was passed by.  Yet, with all her\r\nsense of the venture, it was thankworthy to look back on the trembling\r\nanxiety with which she had watched her boy\xe2\x80\x99s childhood, and all his\r\ntemptations and perils, and compare her fears with his present position:\r\nhis alliance courted, his wisdom honoured, the child of the proud,\r\ncontemned outlaw received as the favourite of the Emperor, and the valued\r\nally of her own honoured burgher world.  Yet he was still a mere lad.\r\nHow would it be for the future?\r\n\r\nWould he be unspoiled?  Yes, even as she already viewed one of her twins\r\nas the star on high\xe2\x80\x94nay, when kneeling in the chapel, her dazzling tears\r\nmade stars of the glint of the light reflected in his bright helmet\xe2\x80\x94might\r\nshe not trust that the other would yet run his course to and fro, as the\r\nspark in the stubble?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\nTHE ALTAR OF PEACE\r\n\r\n\r\nNO one could bear to waken the young Baron till the sun had risen high\r\nenough to fall on his face and unclose his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother\xe2\x80\x9d (ever his first word), \xe2\x80\x9cyou have let me sleep too long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou didst wake too long, I fear me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hoped you knew it not.  Yes, my wound throbbed sore, and the wonders\r\nof the day whirled round my brain like the wild huntsman\xe2\x80\x99s chase.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, cruel boy, thou didst not call to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, with such a yesterday, and such a morrow for you? while, chance\r\nwhat may, I can but lie still.  I thought I must call, if I were still so\r\nwretched, when the last moonbeam faded; but, behold, sleep came, and\r\ntherewith my Friedel sat by me, and has sung songs of peace ever since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd hath lulled thee to content, dear son?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cContent as the echo of his voice and the fulfilment of his hope can make\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.\r\n\r\nAnd so Christina made her son ready for the day\xe2\x80\x99s solemnities, arraying\r\nhim in a fine holland shirt with exquisite broidery of her own on the\r\ncollar and sleeves, and carefully disposing his long glossy, dark brown\r\nhair so as to fall on his shoulders as he lay propped up by cushions.\r\nShe would have thrown his crimson mantle round him, but he repelled it\r\nindignantly.  \xe2\x80\x9cGay braveries for me, while my Friedel is not yet in his\r\nresting-place?  Here\xe2\x80\x94the black velvet cloak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, Ebbo! it makes thee look more of a corpse than a bridegroom.  Thou\r\nwilt scare thy poor little spouse.  Ah! it was not thus I had fancied\r\nmyself decking thee for thy wedding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor little one!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf, as your uncle says, mourning is the\r\nseed of joy, this bridal should prove a gladsome one!  But let her prove\r\na loving child to you, and honour my Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s memory, then shall I love\r\nher well.  Do not fear, motherling; with the roots of hatred and jealousy\r\ntaken out of the heart, even sorrow is such peace that it is almost joy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was over early for pain and sorrow to have taught that lesson, thought\r\nthe mother, as with tender tears she gave place to the priest, who was to\r\nbegin the solemnities of the day by shriving the young Baron.  It was\r\nFather Norbert, who had in this very chamber baptized the brothers, while\r\ntheir grandmother was plotting the destruction of their godfather, even\r\nwhile he gave Friedmund his name of peace,\xe2\x80\x94Father Norbert, who had from\r\nthe very first encouraged the drooping, heart-stricken, solitary\r\nChristina not to be overcome of evil, but to overcome evil with good.\r\n\r\nA temporary altar was erected between the windows, and hung with the silk\r\nand embroidery belonging to that in the chapel: a crucifix was placed on\r\nit, with the shrine of the stone of Nic\xc3\xa6a, one or two other relics\r\nbrought on St. Ruprecht\xe2\x80\x99s cloister, and a beautiful mother-of-pearl and\r\ngold pyx also from the abbey, containing the host.  These were arranged\r\nby the chaplain, Father Norbert, and three of his brethren from the\r\nabbey.  And then the Father Abbot, a kindly, dignified old man, who had\r\nlong been on friendly terms with the young Baron, entered; and after a\r\nfew kind though serious words to him, assumed a gorgeous cope stiff with\r\ngold embroidery, and, standing by the altar, awaited the arrival of the\r\nother assistants at the ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe slender, youthful-looking, pensive lady of the castle, in her wonted\r\nmourning dress, was courteously handed to her son\xe2\x80\x99s bedside by the\r\nEmperor.  He was in his plain buff leathern hunting garb, unornamented,\r\nsave by the rich clasp of his sword-belt and his gold chain, and his head\r\nwas only covered by the long silken locks of fair hair that hung round\r\nhis shoulders; but, now that his large keen dark blue eyes were gravely\r\nrestrained, and his eager face composed, his countenance was so majestic,\r\nhis bearing so lofty, that not all his crowns could have better marked\r\nhis dignity.\r\n\r\nBehind him came a sunburnt, hardy man, wearing the white mantle and black\r\nfleur-de-lis-pointed cross of the Teutonic Order.  A thrill passed\r\nthrough Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s veins as he beheld the man who to him represented the\r\nmurderer of his brother and both his grandfathers, the cruel oppressor of\r\nhis father, and the perpetrator of many a more remote, but equally\r\nunforgotten, injury.  And in like manner Sir Dankwart beheld the actual\r\nslayer of his father, and the heir of a long score of deadly retribution.\r\nNo wonder then that, while the Emperor spoke a few words of salutation\r\nand inquiry, gracious though not familiar, the two foes scanned one\r\nanother with a shiver of mutual repulsing, and a sense that they would\r\nfain have fought it out as in the good old times.\r\n\r\nHowever, Ebbo only beheld a somewhat dull, heavy, honest-looking visage\r\nof about thirty years old, good-nature written in all its flat German\r\nfeatures, and a sort of puzzled wonder in the wide light eyes that stared\r\nfixedly at him, no doubt in amazement that the mighty huge-limbed\r\nWolfgang could have been actually slain by the delicately-framed youth,\r\nnow more colourless than ever in consequence of the morning\xe2\x80\x99s fast.\r\nSchleiermacher was also present, and the chief followers on either hand\r\nhad come into the lower part of the room\xe2\x80\x94Hatto, Heinz, and Koppel,\r\nlooking far from contented; some of the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s suite; and a few\r\nattendants of Schlangenwald, like himself connected with the Teutonic\r\nOrder.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor spoke: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have brought you together, Herr Graff von\r\nSchlangenwald, and Herr Freiherr von Adlerstein, because ye have given us\r\nreason to believe you willing to lay aside the remembrance of the foul\r\nand deadly strifes of your forefathers, and to live as good Christians in\r\nfriendship and brotherhood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSire, it is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Schlangenwald; and \xe2\x80\x9cIt is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Maximilian.  \xe2\x80\x9cNor can our reign better begin than\r\nby the closing of a breach that has cost the land some of its bravest\r\nsons.  Dankwart von Schlangenwald, art thou willing to pardon the heir of\r\nAdlerstein for having slain thy father in free and honourable combat, as\r\nwell as, doubtless, for other deeds of his ancestors, more than I know or\r\ncan specify?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea, truly; I pardon him, my liege, as befits my vow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thou, Eberhard von Adlerstein, dost thou put from thee vengeance for\r\nthy twin brother\xe2\x80\x99s death, and all the other wrongs that thine house has\r\nsuffered?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI put revenge from me for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe agree, further, then, instead of striving as to your rights to the\r\npiece of meadow called the Debateable Strand, and to the wrecks of\r\nburthens there cast up by the stream, ye will unite with the citizens of\r\nUlm in building a bridge over the Braunwasser, where, your mutual\r\nportions thereof being decided by the Swabian League, toll may be taken\r\nfrom all vehicles and beasts passing there over?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe agree,\xe2\x80\x9d said both knights.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I, also, on behalf of the two guilds of Ulm,\xe2\x80\x9d added Moritz\r\nSchleiermacher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLikewise,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Emperor, \xe2\x80\x9cfor avoidance of debate, and to\r\nconsecrate the spot that has caused so much contention, ye will jointly\r\nerect a church, where may be buried both the relatives who fell in the\r\nlate unhappy skirmish, and where ye will endow a perpetual mass for their\r\nsouls, and those of others of your two races.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThereto I willingly agree,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Teutonic knight.  But to Ebbo it\r\nwas a shock that the pure, gentle Friedmund should thus be classed with\r\nhis treacherous assassin; and he had almost declared that it would be\r\nsacrilege, when he received from the Emperor a look of stern, surprised\r\ncommand, which reminded him that concession must not be all on one side,\r\nand that he could not do Friedel a greater wrong than to make him a cause\r\nof strife.  So, though they half choked him, he contrived to utter the\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x9cI consent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in token of amity I here tear up and burn all the feuds of\r\nAdlerstein,\xe2\x80\x9d said Schlangenwald, producing from his pouch a collection of\r\nhostile literature, beginning from a crumpled strip of yellow parchment\r\nand ending with a coarse paper missive in the clerkly hand of\r\nburgher-bred Hugh Sorel, and bearing the crooked signatures of the last\r\ntwo Eberhards of Adlerstein\xe2\x80\x94all with great seals of the eagle shield\r\nappended to them.  A similar collection\xe2\x80\x94which, with one or two other\r\nfamily defiances, and the letters of investiture recently obtained at\r\nUlm, formed the whole archives of Adlerstein\xe2\x80\x94had been prepared within\r\nEbbo\xe2\x80\x99s reach; and each of the two, taking up a dagger, made extensive\r\ngashes in these documents, and then\xe2\x80\x94with no mercy to the future\r\nantiquaries, who would have gloated over them\xe2\x80\x94the whole were hurled into\r\nthe flames on the hearth, where the odour they emitted, if not grateful\r\nto the physical sense, should have been highly agreeable to the moral.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, holy Father Abbot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maximilian, \xe2\x80\x9clet us ratify this happy and\r\nChristian reconciliation by the blessed sacrifice of peace, over which\r\nthese two faithful knights shall unite in swearing good-will and\r\nbrotherhood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch solemn reconciliations were frequent, but, alas were too often a\r\nmockery.  Here, however, both parties were men who felt the awe of the\r\npromise made before the Pardon-winner of all mankind.  Ebbo, bred up by\r\nhis mother in the true life of the Church, and comparatively apart from\r\npractical superstitions, felt the import to the depths of his inmost\r\nsoul, with a force heightened by his bodily state of nervous\r\nimpressibility; and his wan, wasted features and dark shining eyes had a\r\nstrange spiritual beam, \xe2\x80\x9chalf passion and half awe,\xe2\x80\x9d as he followed the\r\nwords of universal forgiveness and lofty praise that he had heard last in\r\nhis anguished trance, when his brother lay dying beside him, and leaving\r\nhim behind.  He knew now that it was for this.\r\n\r\nHis deep repressed ardour and excitement were no small contrast to the\r\nsober, matter-of-fact demeanour of the Teutonic knight, who comported\r\nhimself with the mechanical decorum of an ecclesiastic, but quite as one\r\nwho meant to keep his word.  Maximilian served the mass in his royal\r\ncharacter as sub-deacon.  He was fond of so doing, either from humility,\r\nor love of incongruity, or both.  No one, however, communicated except\r\nthe clergy and the parties concerned\xe2\x80\x94Dankwart first, as being monk as\r\nwell as knight, then Eberhard and his mother; and then followed,\r\ninterposed into the rite, the oath of pardon, friendship, and brotherhood\r\nadministered by the abbot, and followed by the solemn kiss of peace.\r\nThere was now no recoil; Eberhard raised himself to meet the lips of his\r\nfoe, and his heart went with the embrace.  Nay, his inward ear dwelt on\r\nFriedmund\xe2\x80\x99s song mingling with the concluding chants of praise.\r\n\r\nThe service ended, it was part of the pledge of amity that the reconciled\r\nenemies should break their fast together, and a collation of white bread\r\nand wine was provided for the purpose.  The Emperor tried to promote free\r\nand friendly talk between the two adversaries, but not with great\r\nsuccess; for Dankwart, though honest and sincere, seemed extremely dull.\r\nHe appeared to have few ideas beyond his Prussian commandery and its\r\nroutine discipline, and to be lost in a castle where all was at his sole\r\nwill and disposal, and he caught eagerly at all proposals made to him as\r\nif they were new lights.  As, for instance, that some impartial\r\narbitrator should be demanded from the Swabian League to define the\r\nboundary; and that next Rogation-tide the two knights should ride or\r\nclimb it in company, while meantime the serfs should be strictly charged\r\nnot to trespass, and any transgressor should be immediately escorted to\r\nhis own lord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Sir Dankwart, in a most serious tone, \xe2\x80\x9cI am told that a\r\nshe-bear wons in a den on yonder crag, between the pass you call the\r\nGemsbock\xe2\x80\x99s and the Schlangenwald valley.  They told me the right in it\r\nhad never been decided, and I have not been up myself.  To say truth, I\r\nhave lived so long in the sand plains as to have lost my mountain legs,\r\nand I hesitated to see if a hunter could mount thither for fear of fresh\r\noffence; but, if she bide there till Rogation-tide, it will be ill for\r\nthe lambs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Maximilian.  \xe2\x80\x9cThen will I, a neutral, kill your bear\r\nfor you, gentlemen, so that neither need transgress this new crag of\r\ndebate.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll go down and look at your bear spears, friend Ebbo, and be\r\nready so soon as Kasimir has done with his bridal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat crag!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cLittle good will it do either of us.  Sire, it\r\nis a mere wall of sloping rock, slippery as ice, and with only a stone or\r\nmatting of ivy here and there to serve as foothold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere bear can go, man can go,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Kaisar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes!  We have been there, craving your pardon, Herr Graf,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEbbo, \xe2\x80\x9cafter a dead chamois that rolled into a cleft, but it is the worst\r\ncrag on all the hill, and the frost will make it slippery.  Sire, if you\r\ndo venture it, I conjure you to take Koppel, and climb by the rocks from\r\nthe left, not the right, which looks easiest.  The yellow rock, with a\r\nface like a man\xe2\x80\x99s, is the safer; but ach, it is fearful for one who knows\r\nnot the rocks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I know not the rocks, all true German rocks know me,\xe2\x80\x9d smiled\r\nMaximilian, to whom the danger seemed to be such a stimulus that he began\r\nto propose the bear-hunt immediately, as an interlude while waiting for\r\nthe bride.\r\n\r\nHowever, at that moment, half-a-dozen horsemen were seen coming up from\r\nthe ford, by the nearer path, and a forerunner arrived with the tidings\r\nthat the Baron of Adlerstein Wildschloss was close behind with the little\r\nBaroness Thekla.\r\n\r\nHalf the moonlight night had Sir Kasimir and his escort ridden; and,\r\nafter a brief sleep at the nearest inn outside Ulm, he had entered in\r\nearly morning, demanded admittance at the convent, made short work with\r\nthe Abbess Ludmilla\xe2\x80\x99s arguments, claimed his daughter, and placing her on\r\na cushion before him on his saddle, had borne her away, telling her of\r\nfreedom, of the kind lady, and the young knight who had dazzled her\r\nchildish fancy.\r\n\r\nChristina went down to receive her.  There was no time to lose, for the\r\nhuntsman Kaisar was bent on the slaughter of his bear before dark, and,\r\nif he were to be witness of the wedding, it must be immediate.  He was in\r\na state of much impatience, which he beguiled by teasing his friend\r\nWildschloss by reminding him how often he himself had been betrothed, and\r\nhad managed to slip his neck out of the noose.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, if my Margot be not\r\nsoon back on my hands, I shall give the French credit,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, tossing\r\nhis bear-spear in the air, and catching it again.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, this bride is as\r\nlong of busking her as if she were a beauty of seventeen!  I must be off\r\nto my Lady Bearess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus nothing could be done to prepare the little maiden but to divest her\r\nof her mufflings, and comb out her flaxen hair, crowning it with a wreath\r\nwhich Christina had already woven from the myrtle of her own girlhood,\r\nscarcely waiting to answer the bewildered queries and entreaties save by\r\ncaresses and admonitions to her to be very good.\r\n\r\nPoor little thing!  She was tired, frightened, and confused; and, when\r\nshe had been brought upstairs, she answered the half smiling, half shy\r\ngreeting of her bridegroom with a shudder of alarm, and the exclamation,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the beautiful young knight?  That\xe2\x80\x99s a lady going to take the\r\nveil lying under the pall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look rather like a little nun yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, for she wore a\r\nlittle conventual dress, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we must take each other for such as we\r\nare;\xe2\x80\x9d and, as she hid her face and clung to his mother, he added in a\r\nmore cheerful, coaxing tone, \xe2\x80\x9cYou once said you would be my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but then there were two of you, and you were all shining bright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore she could be answered, the impatient Emperor returned, and brought\r\nwith him the abbot, who proceeded to find the place in his book, and to\r\nask the bridegroom for the rings.  Ebbo looked at Sir Kasimir, who owned\r\nthat he should have brought them from Ulm, but that he had forgotten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJewels are not plenty with us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, with a glow of amusement and\r\nconfusion dawning on his cheek, such as reassured the little maid that\r\nshe beheld one of the two beautiful young knights.  \xe2\x80\x9cMust we borrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristina looked at the ring she had first seen lying on her own\r\nEberhard\xe2\x80\x99s palm, and felt as if to let it be used would sever the renewed\r\nhope she scarcely yet durst entertain; and at the same moment Maximilian\r\nglanced at his own fingers, and muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cNone but this!  Unlucky!\xe2\x80\x9d  For\r\nit was the very diamond which Mary of Burgundy had sent to assure him of\r\nher faith, and summon him to her aid after her father\xe2\x80\x99s death.  Sir\r\nKasimir had not retained the pledge of his own ill-omened wedlock; but,\r\nin the midst of the dilemma, the Emperor, producing his dagger, began to\r\ndetach some of the massive gold links of the chain that supported his\r\nhunting-horn.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthe little elf of a bride can get her\r\nfinger into this lesser one and you\xe2\x80\x94verily this largest will fit, and the\r\ngoldsmith can beat it out when needed.  So on with you in St. Hubert\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname, Father Abbot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSlender-boned and thin as was Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s hand, it was a very tight fit, but\r\nthe purpose was served.  The service commenced; and fortunately, thanks\r\nto Thekla\xe2\x80\x99s conventual education, she was awed into silence and decorum\r\nby the sound of Latin and the sight of an abbot.  It was a strange\r\nmarriage, if only in the contrast between the pale, expressive face and\r\nsad, dark eyes of the prostrate youth, and the frightened, bewildered\r\nlittle girl, standing upon a stool to reach up to him, with her blue eyes\r\nstretched with wonder, and her cheeks flushed and pouting with unshed\r\ntears, her rosy plump hand enclosed in the long white wasted one that was\r\nthus for ever united to it by the broken fragments of Kaisar Max\xe2\x80\x99s chain.\r\n\r\nThe rite over, two attestations of the marriage of Eberhard, Freiherr von\r\nAdlerstein, and Thekla, Freiherrinn von Adlerstein Wildschloss and\r\nFelsenbach, were drawn up and signed by the abbot, the Emperor, Count\r\nDankwart, and the father and mother of the two contracting parties; one\r\nto be committed to the care of the abbot, the other to be preserved by\r\nthe house of Adlerstein.\r\n\r\nThen the Emperor, as the concluding grace of the ceremonial, bent to kiss\r\nthe bride; but, tired, terrified, and cross, Thekla, as if quite relieved\r\nto have some object for her resentment, returned his attempt with a\r\nvehement buffet, struck with all the force of her small arm, crying out,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo away with you!  I know I\xe2\x80\x99ve never married _you_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe better for my eyes!\xe2\x80\x9d said the good-natured Emperor, laughing\r\nheartily.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy Lady Bearess is like to prove the more courteous bride!\r\nFare thee well, Sir Bridegroom,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, stooping over Ebbo, and\r\nkissing his brow; \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven give thee joy of this day\xe2\x80\x99s work, and of thy\r\nfaithful little fury.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll send her the bearskin as her meetest\r\nwedding-gift.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the next that was heard from the Kaisar was the arrival of a parcel\r\nof Italian books for the Freiherr Eberhard, and for the little\r\nFreiherrinn a large bundle, which proved to contain a softly-dressed\r\nbearskin, with the head on, the eyes being made of rubies, a gold muzzle\r\nand chain on the nose, and the claws tipped with gold.  The Emperor had\r\nmade a point that it should be conveyed to the castle, snow or no snow,\r\nfor a yule gift.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\nOLD IRON AND NEW STEEL\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE clear sunshine of early summer was becoming low on the hillsides.\r\nSparkling and dimpling, the clear amber-coloured stream of the\r\nBraunwasser rippled along its stony bed, winding in and out among the\r\nrocks so humbly that it seemed to be mocked by the wide span of the arch\r\nthat crossed it in all the might of massive bulwarks, and dignified\r\nmasonry of huge stones.\r\n\r\nSome way above, a clearing of the wood below the mountain showed huts,\r\nand labourers apparently constructing a mill so as to take advantage of\r\nthe leap of the water from the height above; and, on the left bank, an\r\nenclosure was traced out, within which were rising the walls of a small\r\nchurch, while the noise of the mallet and chisel echoed back from the\r\nmountain side, and masons, white with stone-dust, swarmed around.\r\n\r\nAcross the bridge came a pilgrim, marked out as such by hat, wallet, and\r\nlong staff, on which he leant heavily, stumbling along as if both halting\r\nand footsore, and bending as one bowed down by past toil and present\r\nfatigue.  Pausing in the centre, he gazed round with a strange\r\ndisconcerted air\xe2\x80\x94at the castle on the terraced hillside, looking down\r\nwith bright eyes of glass glittering in the sunshine, and lighting up\r\neven that grim old pile; at the banner hanging so lazily that the\r\ntinctures and bearings were hidden in the folds; then at the crags, rosy\r\npurple in evening glow, rising in broad step above step up to the Red\r\nEyrie, bathed in sunset majesty of dark crimson; and above it the sweep\r\nof the descending eagle, discernible for a moment in the pearly light of\r\nthe sky.  The pilgrim\xe2\x80\x99s eye lighted up as he watched it; but then,\r\nlooking down at bridge, and church, and trodden wheel-tracked path, he\r\nfrowned with perplexity, and each painful step grew heavier and more\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\nNear the opposite side of the enclosure there waited a tall,\r\nrugged-looking, elderly man with two horses\xe2\x80\x94one an aged mare, mane, tail,\r\nand all of the snowiest silvery white; the other a little shaggy dark\r\nmountain pony, with a pad-saddle.  And close to the bank of the stream\r\nmight be seen its owner, a little girl of some seven years, whose tight\r\nround lace cap had slipped back, as well as her blue silk hood, and\r\nexposed a profusion of loose flaxen hair, and a plump, innocent face,\r\nintent upon some private little bit of building of her own with some\r\npebbles from the brook, and some mortar filched from the operations\r\nabove, to the great detriment of her soft pinky fingers.\r\n\r\nThe pilgrim looked at her unperceived, and for a moment was about to\r\naddress her; but then, with a strange air of repulsion, dragged himself\r\non to the porch of the rising church, where, seated on a block of stone,\r\nhe could look into the interior.  All was unfinished, but the portion\r\nwhich had made the most progress was a chantry-chapel opposite to the\r\nporch, and containing what were evidently designed to be two monuments.\r\nOne was merely blocked out, but it showed the outline of a warrior,\r\nbearing a shield on which a coiled serpent was rudely sketched in red\r\nchalk.  The other, in a much more forward state, was actually under the\r\nhands of the sculptor, and represented a slender youth, almost a boy,\r\nthough in the full armour of a knight, his hands clasped on his breast\r\nover a lute, an eagle on his shield, an eagle-crest on his helmet, and,\r\nunder the arcade supporting the altar-tomb, shields alternately of eagles\r\nand doves.\r\n\r\nBut the strangest thing was that this young knight seemed to be sitting\r\nfor his own effigy.  The very same face, under the very same helmet, only\r\nwith the varied, warm hues of life, instead of in cold white marble, was\r\nto be seen on the shoulders of a young man in a gray cloth dress, with a\r\nblack scarf passing from shoulder to waist, crossed by a sword-belt.  The\r\nhair was hidden by the helmet, whose raised visor showed keen, finely-cut\r\nfeatures, and a pair of dark brown eyes, of somewhat grave and sad\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave a care, Lucas,\xe2\x80\x9d he presently said; \xe2\x80\x9cI fear me you are chiselling\r\naway too much.  It must be a softer, more rounded face than mine has\r\nbecome; and, above all, let it not catch any saddened look.  Keep that\r\nair of solemn waiting in glad hope, as though he saw the dawn through his\r\nclosed eyelids, and were about to take up his song again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVerily, Herr Freiherr, now the likeness is so far forward, the actual\r\nsight of you may lead me to mar it rather than mend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo is it well that this should be the last sitting.  I am to set forth\r\nfor Genoa in another week.  If I cannot get letters from the Kaisar, I\r\nshall go in search of him, that he may see that my lameness is no more an\r\nimpediment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe pilgrim passed his hand over his face, as though to dissipate a\r\nbewildering dream; and just then the little girl, all flushed and\r\ndabbled, flew rushing up from the stream, but came to a sudden standstill\r\nat sight of the stranger, who at length addressed her.  \xe2\x80\x9cLittle lady,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cis this the Debateable Ford?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; now it is the Friendly Bridge,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child.\r\n\r\nThe pilgrim started, as with a pang of recollection.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is yonder\r\ncastle?\xe2\x80\x9d he further asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSchloss Adlerstein,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, proudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are the little lady of Adlerstein Wildschloss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d again she answered; and then, gathering courage\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a holy\r\npilgrim!  Come up to the castle for supper and rest.\xe2\x80\x9d  And then,\r\nspringing past him, she flew up to the knight, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cHerr Freiherr,\r\nhere is a holy pilgrim, weary and hungry.  Let us take him home to the\r\nmother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he take thee for a wild elf?\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, with an\r\nelder-brotherly endeavour to right the little cap that had slidden under\r\nthe chin, and to push back the unmanageable wealth of hair under it, ere\r\nhe rose; and he came forward and spoke with kind courtesy, as he observed\r\nthe wanderer\xe2\x80\x99s worn air and feeble step.  \xe2\x80\x9cDost need a night\xe2\x80\x99s lodging,\r\nholy palmer?  My mother will make thee welcome, if thou canst climb as\r\nhigh as the castle yonder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe pilgrim made an obeisance, but, instead of answering, demanded\r\nhastily, \xe2\x80\x9cSee I yonder the bearing of Schlangenwald?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so.  Schloss Schlangenwald is about a league further on, and thou\r\nwilt find a kind reception there, if thither thou art bent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that Graff Wolfgang\xe2\x80\x99s tomb?\xe2\x80\x9d still eagerly pursued the pilgrim; and\r\nreceiving a sign in the affirmative, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was his end?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe fell in a skirmish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy whose hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d and the pilgrim surveyed him with undisguised astonishment; then,\r\nwithout another word, took up his staff and limped out of the building,\r\nbut not on the road to Schlangenwald.  It was nearly a quarter of an hour\r\nafterwards that he was overtaken by the young knight and the little lady\r\non their horses, just where the new road to the castle parted from the\r\nold way by the Eagle\xe2\x80\x99s Ladder.  The knight reined up as he saw the poor\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s slow, painful steps, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cSo thou art not bound for\r\nSchlangenwald?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would to the village, so please you\xe2\x80\x94to the shrine of the Blessed\r\nFriedmund.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, at this rate thou wilt not be there till midnight,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young\r\nknight, springing off his horse; \xe2\x80\x9cthou canst never brook our sharp\r\nstones!  See, Thekla, do thou ride on with Heinz to tell the mother I am\r\nbringing her a holy pilgrim to tend.  And thou, good man, mount my old\r\ngray.  Fear not; she is steady and sure-footed, and hath of late been\r\nused to a lame rider.  Ah! that is well.  Thou hast been in the saddle\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo go afoot for the sake of giving a lift to a holy wayfarer was one of\r\nthe most esteemed acts of piety of the Middle Age, so that no one durst\r\nobject to it, and the palmer did no more than utter a suppressed murmur\r\nof acknowledgment as he seated himself on horseback, the young knight\r\nwalking by his rein.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut what is this?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, almost with\r\ndismay.  \xe2\x80\x9cA road to the castle up here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we find it a great convenience.  Thou art surely from these parts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nadded the knight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was a man-at-arms in the service of the Baron,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer, in an\r\nodd, muffled tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x94of my grandfather!\xe2\x80\x9d was the exclamation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d gruffly.  \xe2\x80\x9cOf old Freiherr Eberhard.  Not of any of the Wildschloss\r\ncrew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am not a Wildschloss!  I am grandson to Freiherr Eberhard!  Oh,\r\nwast thou with him and my father when they were set upon in the hostel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe cried, looking eagerly up to the pilgrim; but the man kept his\r\nbroad-leaved hat slouched over his face, and only muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cThe son of\r\nChristina!\xe2\x80\x9d the last word so low that Ebbo was not sure that he caught\r\nit, and the next moment the old warrior exclaimed exultingly, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\r\nhave had vengeance on them!  When\xe2\x80\x94how\xe2\x80\x94where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLast harvest-tide\xe2\x80\x94at the Debateable Strand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, never able to\r\nspeak of the encounter without a weight at his heart, but drawn on by the\r\nearnestness of the old foe of Schlangenwald.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a meeting in full\r\ncareer\xe2\x80\x94lances broken, sword-stroke on either hand.  I was sore wounded,\r\nbut my sword went through his collar-bone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell struck! good stroke!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the pilgrim, in rapture.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd with\r\nthat sword?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith this sword.  Didst know it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, drawing the weapon, and\r\ngiving it to the old man, who held it for a few moments, weighed it\r\naffectionately, and with a long low sigh restored it, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nwell.  You and that blade have paid off the score.  I should be content.\r\nLet me dismount.  I know my way to the hermitage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, what is this?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo; \xe2\x80\x9cthou must have rest and food.  The\r\nhermitage is empty, scarce habitable.  My mother will not be balked of\r\nthe care of thy bleeding feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut let me go, ere I bring evil on you all.  I can pray up there, and\r\nsave my soul, but I cannot see it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee what?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, again trying to see his guest\xe2\x80\x99s face.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere may\r\nbe changes, but an old faithful follower of my father\xe2\x80\x99s must ever be\r\nwelcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot when his wife has taken a new lord,\xe2\x80\x9d growled the stranger, bitterly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand he a Wildschloss!  Young man, I could have pardoned aught else!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know not who you may be who talk of pardoning my lady-mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEbbo, \xe2\x80\x9cbut new lord she has neither taken nor will take.  She has refused\r\nevery offer; and, now that Schlangenwald with his last breath confessed\r\nthat he slew not my father, but sold him to the Turks, I have been only\r\nawaiting recovery from my wound to go in search of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho then is yonder child, who told me she was Wildschloss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, with half a smile and half a blush, \xe2\x80\x9cis my wife,\r\nthe daughter of Wildschloss, who prayed me to espouse her thus early,\r\nthat so my mother might bring her up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time they had reached the castle court, now a well-kept,\r\nlordly-looking enclosure, where the pilgrim looked about him as one\r\nbewildered.  He was so infirm that Ebbo carefully helped him up the stone\r\nstairs to the hall, where he already saw his mother prepared for the\r\nhospitable reception of the palmer.  Leaving him at the entrance, Ebbo\r\ncrossed the hall to say to her in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cThis pilgrim is one of\r\nthe old lanzknechts of my grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s time.  I wonder whether you or\r\nHeinz will know him.  One of the old sort\xe2\x80\x94supremely discontented at\r\nchange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thou hast walked up, and wearied thyself!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Christina,\r\ngrieved to see her son\xe2\x80\x99s halting step.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA rest will soon cure that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, seating himself as he spoke on a\r\nsettle near the hall fire; but the next moment a strange wild low shriek\r\nfrom his mother made him start up and spring to her side.  She stood with\r\nhands clasped, and wondering eyes.  The pilgrim\xe2\x80\x94his hat on the ground,\r\nhis white head and rugged face displayed\xe2\x80\x94was gazing as though devouring\r\nher with his eyes, murmuring, \xe2\x80\x9cUnchanged! unchanged!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this!\xe2\x80\x9d thundered the young Baron.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing to the\r\nlady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! hush, Ebbo!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Christina.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is thy father!  On thy\r\nknees!  Thy father is come!  It is our son, my own lord.  Oh, embrace\r\nhim!  Kneel to him, Ebbo!\xe2\x80\x9d she wildly cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, keeping his arm round her, though she\r\nstruggled against him, for he felt some doubts as he looked back at his\r\nwalk with the stranger, and remembered Heinz\xe2\x80\x99s want of recognition.  \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nit certain that this is indeed my father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Ebbo,\xe2\x80\x9d was the cry of poor Christina, almost beside herself, \xe2\x80\x9chow\r\ncould I not be sure?  I know him!  I feel it!  Oh, my lord, bear with\r\nhim.  It is his wont to be so loving!  Ebbo, cannot you see it is\r\nhimself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe young fellow is right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, slowly.  \xe2\x80\x9cI will answer\r\nall he may demand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, abashed, \xe2\x80\x9cforgive me;\xe2\x80\x9d and, as his mother broke\r\nfrom him, he fell upon his knee; but he only heard his father\xe2\x80\x99s cry, \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\r\nStine, Stine, thou alone art the same,\xe2\x80\x9d and, looking up, saw her, with\r\nher face hidden in the white beard, quivering with a rapture such as he\r\nhad never seen in her before.  It seemed long to him ere she looked up\r\nagain in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s face to sob on: \xe2\x80\x9cMy son!  Oh! my beautiful twins!\r\nOur son!  Oh, see him, dear lord!\xe2\x80\x9d  And the pilgrim turned to hear Ebbo\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon, honoured father, and your blessing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlmost bashfully the pilgrim laid his hand on the dark head, and murmured\r\nsomething; then said, \xe2\x80\x9cUp, then!  The slayer of Schlangenwald kneeling!\r\nAh!  Stine, I knew thy little head was wondrous wise, but I little\r\nthought thou wouldst breed him up to avenge us on old Wolfgang!  So\r\nslender a lad too!  Ha!  Schneiderlein, old rogue, I knew thee,\xe2\x80\x9d holding\r\nout his hand.  \xe2\x80\x9cSo thou didst get home safe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, my lord; though, if I left you alive, never more will I call a man\r\ndead,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heinz.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorse luck for me\xe2\x80\x94till now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Eberhard, whose tones, rather than\r\nhis looks, carried perfect conviction of his identity.  It was the old\r\nhomely accent, and gruff good-humoured voice, but with something subdued\r\nand broken in the tone.  His features had grown like his father\xe2\x80\x99s, but he\r\nlooked much older than ever the hale old mountaineer had done, or than\r\nhis real age; so worn and lined was his face, his skin tanned, his\r\neyelids and temples puckered by burning sun, his hair and beard white as\r\nthe inane of his old mare, the proud Adlerstein port entirely gone.  He\r\nstooped even more without his staff than with it; and, when he yielded\r\nhimself with a sigh of repose to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s tendance, she found that he\r\nhad not merely the ordinary hurts of travelling, but that there were old\r\nfestering scars on his ankles.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe gyves,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as she looked up at\r\nhim, with startled, pitying eyes.  \xe2\x80\x9cLittle deemed I that they would ever\r\ncome under thy tender hands.\xe2\x80\x9d  As he almost timidly smoothed the braid of\r\ndark hair on her brow\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSo they never burnt thee for a witch after all,\r\nlittle one?  I thought my mother would never keep her hands off thee, and\r\nused to fancy I heard the crackling of the flame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe spared me for my children\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina; \xe2\x80\x9cand truly Heaven\r\nhas been very good to us, but never so much as now.  My dear lord, will\r\nit weary thee too much to come to the castle chapel and give thanks?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, timidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, earnestly.  \xe2\x80\x9cI would go even on my\r\nknees.  We were not without masses even in Tunis; but, when Italian and\r\nSpaniard would be ransomed, and there was no mind of the German, I little\r\nthought I should ever sing Brother Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s psalm about turning our\r\ncaptivity as rivers in the south.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEbbo was hovering round, supplying all that was needed for his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomfort; but his parents were so completely absorbed in one another that\r\nhe was scarcely noticed, and, what perhaps pained him more, there was no\r\nword about Friedel.  He felt this almost an injustice to the brother who\r\nhad been foremost in embracing the idea of the unknown father, and\r\nscarcely understood how his parents shrank from any sorrowful thought\r\nthat might break in on their new-found joy, nor that he himself was so\r\nstrange and new a being in his father\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, that to imagine him doubled\r\nwas hardly possible to the tardy, dulled capacity, which as yet seemed\r\nunable to feel anything but that here was home, and Christina.\r\n\r\nWhen the chapel bell rang, and the pair rose to offer their thanksgiving,\r\nEbbo dutifully offered his support, but was absolutely unseen, so fondly\r\nwas Sir Eberhard leaning on his wife; and her bright exulting smile and\r\nshake of the head gave an absolute pang to the son who had hitherto been\r\nall in all to her.\r\n\r\nHe followed, and, as they passed Friedmund\xe2\x80\x99s coffin, he thought his\r\nmother pointed to it, but even of this he was uncertain.  The pair knelt\r\nside by side with hands locked together, while notes of praise rose from\r\nall voices; and meantime Ebbo, close to that coffin, strove to share the\r\njoy, and to lift up a heart that _would_ sink in the midst of\r\nself-reproach for undutifulness, and would dislike the thought of the\r\nrude untaught man, holding aloof from him, likely to view him with\r\ndistrust and jealousy, and to undo all he had achieved, and further\r\nabsorbing the mother, the mother who was to him all the world, and for\r\nwhose sake he had given his best years to the child-wife, as yet nothing\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nIt was reversing the natural order of things that, after reigning from\r\ninfancy, he should have to give up at eighteen to one of the last\r\ngeneration; and some such thought rankled in his mind when the whole\r\nhousehold trooped joyfully out of the chapel to prepare a banquet for\r\ntheir old new lord, and their young old lord was left alone.\r\n\r\nAlone with the coffin where the armour lay upon the white cross, Ebbo\r\nthrew himself on his knees, and laid his head upon it, murmuring, \xe2\x80\x9cAh,\r\nFriedel!  Friedel!  Would that we had changed places!  Thou wouldst brook\r\nit better.  At least thou didst never know what it is to be lonely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerr Baron!\xe2\x80\x9d said a little voice.\r\n\r\nHis first movement was impatient.  Thekla was apt to pursue him wherever\r\nhe did not want her; but here he had least expected her, for she had a\r\ngreat fear of that coffin, and could hardly be brought to the chapel at\r\nprayer times, when she generally occupied herself with fancies that the\r\nempty helmet glared at her.  But now Ebbo saw her standing as near as she\r\ndurst, with a sweet wistfulness in her eyes, such as he had never seen\r\nthere before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Thekla?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \xe2\x80\x9cArt sent to call me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; only I saw that you stayed here all alone,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, clasping her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n  [Picture: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No; only I saw that you stayed here all alone,\xe2\x80\x99 she said,\r\n                     clasping her hands.\xe2\x80\x9d  Page 269]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust I not be alone, child?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, bitterly.  \xe2\x80\x9cHere lies my brother.\r\nMy mother has her husband again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Thekla; and, as he looked up between amusement\r\nand melancholy, he met such a loving eager little face, that he could not\r\nhelp holding out his arms, and letting her cling to him.  \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll never be afraid of the helmet again, if only you will not lay\r\ndown your head there, and say you are alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, Thekla! while you are my little wife,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; and, child as she\r\nwas, there was strange solace to his heart in the eyes that, once vacant\r\nand wondering, had now gained a look of love and intelligence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, shuddering a little, as he rose and\r\nlaid his hand on Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s sword.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo make thee gird on thine own knight\xe2\x80\x99s sword,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, unbuckling\r\nthat which he had so long worn.  \xe2\x80\x9cFriedel,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cthou wouldst give\r\nme thine.  Let me take up thy temper with it, thine open-hearted love and\r\nhumility.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe guided Thekla\xe2\x80\x99s happy little fingers to the fastening of the belt, and\r\nthen, laying his hand on hers, said gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cThekla, never speak of what\r\nI said just now\xe2\x80\x94not even to the mother.  Remember, it is thy husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfirst secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd feeling no longer solitary when his hand was in the clasp of hers, he\r\nreturned to the hall, where his father was installed in the baronial\r\nchair, in which Ebbo had been at home from babyhood.  His mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexclamation showed that her son had been wanting to her; and she looked\r\nfuller than ever of bliss when Ebbo gravely stood before his father, and\r\npresented him with the good old sword that he had sent to his unborn son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are like to use it more than I,\xe2\x80\x94nay, you have used it to some\r\npurpose,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.  \xe2\x80\x9cYet must I keep mine old comrade at least a little\r\nwhile.  Wife, son, sword, should make one feel the same man again, but it\r\nis all too wonderful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll that evening, and long after, his hand from time to time sought the\r\nhilt of his sword, as if that touch above all proved to him that he was\r\nagain a free noble in his own castle.\r\n\r\nThe story he told was thus.  The swoon in which Heinz had left him had\r\nprobably saved his life by checking the gush of blood, and he had known\r\nno more till he found himself in a rough cart among the corpses.  At\r\nSchlangenwald\xe2\x80\x99s castle he had been found still breathing, and had been\r\nflung into a dungeon, where he lay unattended, for how long he never\r\nknew, since all the early part of the time was lost in the clouds of\r\nfever.  On coarse fare and scanty drink, in that dark vault, he had\r\nstruggled by sheer obstinacy of vitality into recovery.  In the very\r\nheight of midsummer alone did the sun peep through the grating of his\r\ncell, and he had newly hailed this cheerful visitor when he was roughly\r\nsummoned, placed on horseback with eyes and hands bound, and only allowed\r\nsight again to find himself among a herd of his fellow Germans in the\r\nTurkish camp.  They were the prisoners of the terrible Turkish raid of\r\n1475, when Georg von Schenk and fourteen other noblemen of Austria and\r\nStyria were all taken in one unhappy fight, and dragged away into\r\ncaptivity, with hundreds of lower rank.\r\n\r\nTo Sir Eberhard the change had been greatly for the better.  The Turk had\r\ntreated him much better than the Christian; and walking in the open air,\r\nchained to a German comrade, was far pleasanter than pining in his lonely\r\ndungeon.  At Adrianople, an offer had been made to each of the captives,\r\nif they would become Moslems, of entering the Ottoman service as Spahis;\r\nbut with one voice they had refused, and had then been draughted into\r\ndifferent divisions.  The fifteen nobles, who had been offered for\r\nransom, were taken to Constantinople, to await its arrival, and they had\r\npromised Sir Eberhard to publish his fate on their return to their homes;\r\nand, though he knew the family resources too well to have many hopes, he\r\nwas rather hurt to find that their promise had been unfulfilled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas! they had no opportunity,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cGulden were scarce, or were\r\nall in Kaisar Friedrich\xe2\x80\x99s great chest; the ransoms could not be raised,\r\nand all died in captivity.  I heard about it when I was at Wurms last\r\nmonth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe boy at Wurms?\xe2\x80\x9d almost gasped Sir Eberhard in amaze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had to be there about matters concerning the Wildschloss lands and the\r\nbridge,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo; \xe2\x80\x9cand both Dankwart von Schlangenwald and I made\r\nspecial inquiries about that company in case you should have shared their\r\nfate.  I hoped to have set forth at that time, but the Kaisar said I was\r\nstill too lame, and refused me license, or letters to the Sultan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would not have found me,\xe2\x80\x9d said his father, narrating how he with a\r\nlarge troop of captives had been driven down to the coast; where they\r\nwere transferred to a Moorish slave-dealer, who shipped them off for\r\nTunis.  Here, after their first taste of the miseries of a sea life, the\r\nalternative of Islam or slavery was again put before them.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, by the\r\nholy stone of Nic\xc3\xa6a,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Eberhard, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought by that time that the\r\ninfidels had the advantage of us in good-will and friendliness; but, when\r\nthey told me women had no souls at all, no more than a horse or dog, I\r\nknew it was but an empty dream of a religion; for did I not know that my\r\nlittle Ermentrude, and thou, Stine, had finer, clearer, wiser souls than\r\never a man I had known?  \xe2\x80\x98Nay, nay,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth I, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll cast in my lot where\r\nI may meet my wife hereafter, should I never see her here.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d  He had then\r\nbeen allotted to a corsair, and had thenceforth been chained to the bench\r\nof rowers, between the two decks, where, in stifling heat and stench, in\r\nstorm or calm, healthy or diseased, the wretched oarsmen were compelled\r\nto play the part of machinery in propelling the vessel, in order to\r\ncapture Christian ships\xe2\x80\x94making exertions to which only the perpetual lash\r\nof the galley-master could have urged their exhausted frames; often not\r\ndesisting for twenty or thirty hours, and rowing still while sustenance\r\nwas put into their mouths by their drivers.  Many a man drew has last\r\nbreath with his last stroke, and was at the first leisure moment hurled\r\ninto the waves.  It was the description that had so deeply moved Friedel\r\nlong ago, and Christina wept over it, as she looked at the bowed form\r\nonce so proud and free, and thought of the unhealed scars.  But there,\r\nher husband added, he had been chained next to a holy friar of German\r\nblood, like himself a captive of the great Styrian raid; and, while some\r\nblasphemed in their misery, or wildly chid their patron saints, this good\r\nman strove to show that all was to work out good; he had a pious saying\r\nfor all that befell, and adored the will of God in thus purifying him;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, if it were thus with a saint like him, I thought, what must it be\r\nwith a rough freebooting godless sinner such as I had been?  See\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he\r\ntook out a rosary of strung bladders of seaweed; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is what he left me\r\nwhen he died, and what I meant to have been telling for ever up in the\r\nhermitage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe died, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy\xe2\x80\x94he died on the shore of Corsica, while most of the dogs were off\r\nharrying a village inland, and we had a sort of respite, or I trow he\r\nwould have rowed till his last gasp.  How he prayed for the poor wretches\r\nthey were gone to attack!\xe2\x80\x94ay, and for all of us\xe2\x80\x94for me also\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenough of it.  Such talk skills not now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was plain that Sir Eberhard had learnt more Christianity in the hold\r\nof his Moorish pirate ship than ever in the Holy Roman Empire, and a\r\nweight was lifted off his son\xe2\x80\x99s mind by finding that he had vowed never\r\nto return to a life of violence, even though fancying a life of penance\r\nin a hermitage the only alternative.\r\n\r\nEbbo asked if the Genoese merchant, Ser Gian Battista dei Battiste, had\r\nindeed been one of his fellow-captives.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x94what?\xe2\x80\x9d and on the repetition, \xe2\x80\x9cTruly I knew him, Merchant Gian as we\r\nused to call him; but you twang off his name as they speak it in his own\r\nstately city.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristina smiled.  \xe2\x80\x9cEbbo learnt the Italian tongue this winter from our\r\nchaplain, who had studied at Bologna.  He was told it would aid in his\r\nquest of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me not!\xe2\x80\x9d said the traveller, holding up his hands in deprecation;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe Junker is worse than a priest!  And yet he killed old Wolfgang!  But\r\nwhat of Gian?  Hold,\xe2\x80\x94did not he, when I was with him at Genoa, tell me a\r\nstory of being put into a dungeon in a mountain fortress in Germany, and\r\nreleased by a pair of young lads with eyes beaming in the sunrise, who\r\nvanished just as they brought him to a cloister?  Nay, he deemed it a\r\nmiracle of the saints, and hung up a votive picture thereof at the shrine\r\nof the holy Cosmo and Damian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was not so far wrong in deeming _one_ of the lads near of kin to the\r\nholy ones,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, softly.\r\n\r\nAnd Ebbo briefly narrated the adventure, when it evidently appeared that\r\nhis having led at least one foray gave his father for the first time a\r\nfellow-feeling for him, and a sense that he was one of the true old\r\nstock; but, when he heard of the release, he growled, \xe2\x80\x9cSo!  How would a\r\nlad have fared who so acted in my time?  My poor old mother!  She must\r\nhave been changed indeed not to have scourged him till he had no strength\r\nto cry out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was my prisoner!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, in his old defiant tone; \xe2\x80\x9cI had the\r\nright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well! the Junker has always been master here, and I never!\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nelder knight, looking round rather piteously; and Ebbo, with a sudden\r\nmovement, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cNay, sir, you are the only lord and master, and I\r\nstand ready to be the first to obey you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou!  A fine young book-learned scholar, already knighted, and with all\r\nthese Wildschloss lands too!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Eberhard, gazing with a strange\r\npuzzled look at the delicate but spirited features of this strange\r\nperplexing son.  \xe2\x80\x9cReach hither your hand, boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as he compared the slender, shapely hand of such finely-textured skin\r\nwith the breadth of his own horny giant\xe2\x80\x99s paw, he tossed it from him,\r\nshaking his head with a gesture as if he had no commands for such\r\nfeminine-looking fingers to execute, and mortifying Ebbo not a little.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina, apologetically, \xe2\x80\x9cit always grieved your mother that\r\nthe boys would resemble me and mine.  But, when daylight comes, Ebbo will\r\nshow you that he has not lost the old German strength.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt\xe2\x80\x94no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Eberhard, hastily, \xe2\x80\x9csince he has slain\r\nSchlangenwald; and, if the former state of things be at an end, the less\r\nhe takes after the ancient stock the better.  But I am an old man now,\r\nStine, though thou look\xe2\x80\x99st fair and fresh as ever, and I do not know what\r\nto make of these things.  White napery on the table; glass drinking\r\nthings;\xe2\x80\x94nay, were it not for thee and the Schneiderlein, I should not\r\nknow I was at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was led back to his narration, and it appeared that, after some years\r\nspent at the oar, certain bleedings from the lungs, the remains of his\r\nwound, had become so much more severe as to render him useless for naval\r\npurposes; and, as he escaped actually dying during a voyage, he was\r\nallowed to lie by on coming into port till he had in some degree\r\nrecovered, and then had been set to labour at the fortifications, chained\r\nto another prisoner, and toiling between the burning sand and burning\r\nsun, but treated with less horrible severity than the necessities of the\r\nsea had occasioned on board ship, and experiencing the benefit of\r\nintercourse with the better class of captives, whom their miserable fate\r\nhad thrown into the hands of the Moors.\r\n\r\nIt was a favourite almsdeed among the Proven\xc3\xa7als, Spaniards, and Italians\r\nto send money for the redemption of prisoners to the Moors, and there was\r\na regular agency for ransoms through the Jews; but German captives were\r\nsuch an exception that no one thought of them, and many a time had the\r\nsummons come for such and such a slave by name, or for five poor\r\nSicilians, twenty Genoese, a dozen Marseillais, or the like, but still no\r\nword for the Swabian; till he had made up his mind that he should either\r\nleave his bones in the hot mud of the harbour, or be only set free by\r\nsome gallant descent either of the brave King of Portugal, or of the\r\nKnights of Rhodes, of whom the captives were ever dreaming and\r\nwhispering.\r\n\r\nAt length his own slave name was shouted; he was called up by the captain\r\nof his gang, and, while expecting some fresh punishment, or, maybe, to\r\nfind himself sold into some domestic form of slavery, he was set before a\r\nJewish agent, who, after examining him on his name, country, and station,\r\nand comparing his answers with a paper of instructions, informed him that\r\nhe was ransomed, caused his fetters to be struck off, and shipped him off\r\nat once for Genoa, with orders to the captain to consign him to the\r\nmerchant Signor del Battiste.  By him Sir Eberhard had been received with\r\nthe warmest hospitality, and treated as befitted his original station,\r\nbut Battista disclaimed the merit of having ransomed him.  He had but\r\nacted, he said, as the agent of an Austrian gentleman, from whom he had\r\nreceived orders to inquire after the Swabian baron who had been his\r\nfellow-captive, and, if he were still living, to pay his ransom, and\r\nbring him home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe name\xe2\x80\x94the name!\xe2\x80\x9d eagerly asked Ebbo and his mother at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe name?  Gian was wont to make bad work of our honest German names,\r\nbut I tried to learn this\xe2\x80\x94being so beholden to him.  I even caused it to\r\nbe spelt over to me, but my letters long ago went from me.  It seems to\r\nme that the man is a knight-errant, like those of thy ballads, Stine\xe2\x80\x94one\r\nRitter Theur\xe2\x80\x94Theur\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheurdank!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ebbo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, Theurdank.  What, you know him?  There is nothing you and your\r\nmother don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow him!  Father, he is our greatest and noblest!  He has been kind to\r\nme beyond description.  He is the Kaisar!  Now I see why he had that\r\nstrange arch look which so vexed me when he forbade me on my allegiance\r\nto set forth till my lameness should be gone!  Long ago had he asked me\r\nall about Gian Battista.  To him he must have written.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Kaisar!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Eberhard.  \xe2\x80\x9cNay, the poor fellows I left in Turkey\r\never said he was too close of fist for them to have hope from him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! that was old Kaisar Friedrich.  This is our own gallant Maximilian\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nknight as true and brave as ever was paladin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina; \xe2\x80\x9cand most\r\ntruly loving and prizing our Ebbo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet I wish\xe2\x80\x94I wish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he had let me win my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nliberty for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said his father, \xe2\x80\x9cthere spoke the Adlerstein.  We never were\r\nwont to be beholden to king or kaisar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d say Ebbo, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s recollection, colouring as he spoke;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit is true that I deserved it not.  Nay, Sir Father, it is well.  You\r\nowe your freedom in very truth to the son you have not known.  It was he\r\nwho treasured up the thought of the captive German described by the\r\nmerchant, and even dreamt of it, while never doubting of your death; it\r\nwas he who caught up Schlangenwald\xe2\x80\x99s first hint that you lived, while I,\r\nin my pride, passed it by as merely meant to perplex me; it was he who\r\nhad formed an absolute purpose of obtaining some certainty; and at last,\r\nwhen my impetuosity had brought on the fatal battle, it was he who bought\r\nwith his own life the avowal of your captivity.  I had hoped to have\r\nfulfilled Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s trust, and to have redeemed my own backwardness; but\r\nit is not to be.  While I was yet lying helpless on my bed, the Emperor\r\nhas taken it out of my power.  Mother, you receive him from Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd well am I thankful that so it should be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christina.  \xe2\x80\x9cAh,\r\nEbbo! sorely should I have pined with anxiety when thou wast gone.  And\r\nthy father knows that thou hadst the full purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea, I know it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man; \xe2\x80\x9cand, after all, small blame to him\r\neven if he had not.  He never saw me, and light grieves the heart for\r\nwhat the eye hath not seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d added the wife, \xe2\x80\x9csince the Romish king freed you, dear lord, cared\r\nhe not better for your journey than to let you come in this forlorn\r\nplight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis, it appeared, was far from being his deliverer\xe2\x80\x99s fault.  Money had\r\nbeen supplied, and Sir Eberhard had travelled as far as Aosta with a\r\nparty of Italian merchants; but no sooner had he parted with them than he\r\nwas completely astray.  His whole experience of life had been as a robber\r\nbaron or as a slave, and he knew not how to take care of himself as a\r\npeaceful traveller; he suffered fresh extortions at every stage, and\r\nafter a few days was plundered by his guides, beaten, and left devoid of\r\nall means of continuing the journey to which he could hardly hope for a\r\ncheerful end.  He did not expect to find his mother living,\xe2\x80\x94far less that\r\nhis unowned wife could have survived the perils in which he had involved\r\nher; and he believed that his ancestral home would, if not a ruin, be\r\nheld by his foes, or at best by the rival branch of the family, whose\r\nwelcome of the outlawed heir would probably be to a dungeon, if not a\r\nhalter.  Yet the only magnet on earth for the lonely wanderer was his\r\nnative mountain, where from some old peasant he might learn how his fair\r\nyoung bride had perished, and perhaps the sins of his youth might be\r\nexpiated by continual prayer in the hermitage chapel where his sister lay\r\nburied, and whence he could see the crags for which his eye and heart had\r\ncraved so long with the home-sickness of a mountaineer.\r\n\r\nAnd now, when his own Christina had welcomed him with all the overflow of\r\nher loving heart, unchanged save that hers had become a tenderer yet more\r\ndignified loveliness; when his gallant son, in all the bloom of young\r\nmanhood, received him with dutiful submission; when the castle, in a\r\nstate of defence, prosperity, and comfort of which he had never dreamt,\r\nwas again his own;\xe2\x80\x94still the old man was bewildered, and sometimes\r\noppressed almost to distress.  He had, as it were, fallen asleep in one\r\nage of the world, and wakened in another, and it seemed as if he really\r\nwished to defer his wakening, or else that repose was an absolute novelty\r\nto him; for he sat dozing in his chair in the sun the whole of the next\r\nday, and scarcely spoke.\r\n\r\nEbbo, who felt it a necessity to come to an understanding of the terms on\r\nwhich they were to stand, tried to refer matters to him, and to explain\r\nthe past, but he was met sometimes by a shake of the head, sometimes by a\r\nnod\xe2\x80\x94not of assent, but of sleep; and his mother advised him not to harass\r\nthe wearied traveller, but to leave him to himself at least for that day,\r\nand let him take his own time for exertion, letting things meantime go on\r\nas usual.  Ebbo obeyed, but with a load at his heart, as he felt that all\r\nhe was doing was but provisional, and that it would be his duty to resign\r\nall that he had planned, and partly executed, to this incompetent,\r\nignorant rule.  He could certainly, when not serving the Emperor, go and\r\nact for himself at Thekla\xe2\x80\x99s dower castle of Felsenbach, and his mother\r\nmight save things from going to utter ruin at Adlerstein; but no\r\nreflection or self-reproach could make it otherwise than a bitter pill to\r\nany Telemachus to have to resign to one so unlike Ulysses in all but the\r\nlength of his wanderings,\xe2\x80\x94one, also, who seemed only half to like, and\r\nnot at all to comprehend, his Telemachus.\r\n\r\nMeantime Ebbo attended to such matters as were sure to come each day\r\nbefore the Herr Freiherr.  Now it was a question whether the stone for\r\nthe mill should be quarried where it would undermine a bit of grass land,\r\nor further on, where the road was rougher; now Berend\xe2\x80\x99s swine had got\r\ninto Barthel\xe2\x80\x99s rye, and Barthel had severely hurt one of them\xe2\x80\x94the Herr\r\nFreiherr\xe2\x80\x99s interference could alone prevent a hopeless quarrel; now a\r\nwaggon with ironwork for the mill claimed exemption from toll as being\r\nfor the Baron: and he must send down the toll, to obviate injustice\r\ntowards Schlangenwald and Ulm.  Old Ulrich\xe2\x80\x99s grandson, who had run away\r\nfor a lanzknecht, had sent a letter home (written by a comrade), the\r\nBaron must read and answer it.  Steinmark\xe2\x80\x99s son wanted to be a poor\r\nstudent: the Herr Freiherr must write him a letter of recommendation.\r\nMother Grethel\xe2\x80\x99s ewe had fallen into a cleft; her son came to borrow a\r\nrope, and ask aid, and the Baron must superintend the hoisting the poor\r\nbeast up again.  Hans had found the track of a wolf, and knew the hole\r\nwhere a litter of cubs abode; the Freiherr, his wolf-hound, and his spear\r\nwere wanted for their destruction.  Dietrich could not tell how to manage\r\nhis new arquebus: the Baron must teach him to take aim.  Then there was a\r\nletter from Ulm to invite the Baron to consult on the tax demanded by the\r\nEmperor for his Italian war, and how far it should concern the profits of\r\nthe bridge; and another letter from the Markgraf of Wurtemburg, as chief\r\nof the Swabian League, requesting the Lord of Adlerstein to be on the\r\nlook-out for a band of robbers, who were reported to be in neighbouring\r\nhills, after being hunted out of some of their other lurking-places.\r\n\r\nThat very night, or rather nearly at the dawn of a summer morning, there\r\nwas a yelling below the castle, and a flashing of torches, and tidings\r\nrang through it that a boor on the outskirts of the mountain had had his\r\nricks fired and his cattle driven by the robbers, and his young daughters\r\ncarried off.  Old Sir Eberhard hobbled down to the hall in time to see\r\nweapons flashing as they were dealt out, to hear a clear decided voice\r\ngiving orders, to listen to the tramp of horse, and watch more reitern\r\npass out under the gateway than ever the castle had counted in his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s time.  Then he went back to his bed, and when he came down in\r\nthe morning, found all the womankind of the castle roasting and boiling.\r\nAnd, at noon, little Thekla came rushing down from the watch-tower with\r\nnews that all were coming home up the Eagle\xe2\x80\x99s Steps, and she was sure\r\n_her_ baron had sent her, and waved to her.  Soon after, _her_ baron in\r\nhis glittering steel rode his cream-coloured charger (once Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s)\r\ninto the castle court, followed by his exultant merrymen.  They had\r\novertaken the thieves in good time, made them captives, and recovered the\r\nspoil unhurt; and Heinz and Koppel made the castle ring with the deed of\r\ntheir young lord, who had forced the huge leader of the band to the\r\nearth, and kept him down by main strength till they could come to bind\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy main strength?\xe2\x80\x9d slowly asked Sir Eberhard, who had been stirred into\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a loose-limbed, awkward fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9cless strong than he\r\nlooked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot only that, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heinz, looking from his old master to his\r\nyoung one; \xe2\x80\x9cbut old iron is not a whit stronger than new steel, though\r\nthe one looks full of might, and you would think the other but a toy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what have you done with the rogues\xe2\x80\x99 heads?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old knight.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI looked to see them on your spears.  Or have you hung them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ebbo.  \xe2\x80\x9cI sent the men off to Stuttgard with an\r\nescort.  I dislike doing execution ourselves; it makes the men so\r\nlawless.  Besides, this farmer was Schlangenwalder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet he came to you for redress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, for Sir Dankwart is at his commandery, and he and I agreed to look\r\nafter each other\xe2\x80\x99s lands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Eberhard retired to his chair as if all had gone past his\r\nunderstanding, and thence he looked on while his son and wife hospitably\r\nregaled, and then dismissed, their auxiliaries in the rescue.\r\n\r\nAfterwards Christina told her son that she thought his father was rested,\r\nand would be better able to attend to him, and Ebbo, with a painful\r\nswelling in his heart, approached him deferentially, with a request that\r\nhe would say what was his pleasure with regard to the Emperor, to whom\r\nacknowledgments must in the first place be made for his release, and next\r\nwould arise the whole question of homage and investiture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook you here, fair son,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Eberhard, rousing himself, \xe2\x80\x9cthese\r\nthings are all past me.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll have none of them.  You and your Kaisar\r\nunderstand one another, and your homage is paid.  It boots not changing\r\nall for an old fellow that is but come home to die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, father, it is in the order of things that you should be lord here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never was lord here, and, what is more, I would not, and could not be.\r\nSon, I marked you yesterday.  You are master as never was my poor father,\r\nwith all the bawling and blows that used to rule the house, while these\r\nfellows mind you at a word, in a voice as quiet as your mother\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nBesides, what should I do with all these mills and bridges of yours, and\r\nDiets, and Leagues, and councils enough to addle a man\xe2\x80\x99s brain?  No, no;\r\nI could once slay a bear, or strike a fair stroke at a Schlangenwalder,\r\nbut even they got the better of me, and I am good for nothing now but to\r\nsave my soul.  I had thought to do it as a hermit up there; but my little\r\nChristina thinks the saints will be just as well pleased if I tell my\r\nbeads here, with her to help me, and I know that way I shall not make so\r\nmany mistakes.  So, young Sir, if you can give the old man a corner of\r\nthe hearth while he lives, he will never interfere with you.  And, maybe,\r\nif the castle were in jeopardy in your absence, with that new-fangled\r\nroad up to it, he could tell the fellows how to hold it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir\xe2\x80\x94dear father,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the ardent Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is not a fit state of\r\nthings.  I will spare you all trouble and care; only make me not\r\nundutiful; take your own place.  Mother, convince him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my son,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Eberhard; \xe2\x80\x9cyour mother sees what is best for me.\r\nI only want to be left to her to rest a little while, and repent of my\r\nsinful life.  As Heinz says, the rusty old iron must lie by while the new\r\nsteel does the work.  It is quiet that I need.  It is joy enough for me\r\nto see what she has made you, and all around.  Ah!  Stine, my white dove,\r\nI knew thine was a wise head; but when I left thee, gentle little\r\nfrightened, fluttering thing, how little could I have thought that all\r\nalone, unaided, thou wouldst have kept that little head above water, and\r\nmade thy son work out all these changes\xe2\x80\x94thy doing\xe2\x80\x94and so I know they are\r\ngood and seemly.  I see thou hast made him clerkly, quick-witted, and yet\r\na good knight.  Ah! thou didst tell me oft that our lonely pride was not\r\nhigh nor worthy fame.  Stine, how didst do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did it not, dear husband; God did it for me.  He gave the boys the\r\nloving, true tempers that worked out the rest!  He shielded them and me\r\nin our days of peril.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, father,\xe2\x80\x9d added Ebbo, \xe2\x80\x9cProvidence guarded us; but, above all, our\r\nchief blessing has been the mother who has made one of us a holy saint,\r\nand taught the other to seek after him!  Father, I am glad you see how\r\ngreat has been the work of the Dove you brought to the Eagle\xe2\x80\x99s Nest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\nTHE STAR AND THE SPARK\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE year 1531 has begun, and Schloss Adlerstein remains in its strength\r\non the mountain side, but with a look of cultivation on its environs such\r\nas would have amazed Kunigunde.  Vines run up trellises against the\r\nrocks; pot-herbs and flowers nestle in the nooks; outbuildings cluster\r\nround it; and even the grim old keep has a range of buildings connected\r\nwith it, as if the household had entirely outgrown the capacities of the\r\nsquare tower.\r\n\r\nYet the old hall is still the chief place of assembly, and now that it\r\nhas been wainscoted, with a screen of carved wood to shut off the\r\ndraughty passages, and a stove of bright tiles to increase the warmth, it\r\nis far more cheerful.  Moreover, a window has been opened showing the\r\nrich green meadow below, with the bridge over the Braunwasser, and the\r\nlittle church, with a spire of pierced lace-work, and white cottages\r\npeeping out of the retreating forest.\r\n\r\nThat is the window which the Lady Baroness loves.  See her there, the\r\nlovely old lady of seventy-five\xe2\x80\x94yes, lovelier than ever, for her sweet\r\nbrown eyes have the same pensive, clear beauty, enhanced by the snowy\r\nwhiteness of her hair, of which a soft braid shows over the pure pale\r\nbrow beneath the white band, and sweeping black veil, that she has worn\r\nby right for twenty years.  But the slight form is active and brisk, and\r\nthere are ready smiles and looks of interest for the pretty fair-haired\r\nmaidens, three in number, who run in and out from their household\r\navocations to appeal to the \xe2\x80\x9cdear grandmother,\xe2\x80\x9d mischievously to tell of\r\nthe direful yawns proceeding from brothers Ebbo and Gottfried over their\r\nstudies with their tutor, or to gaze from the window and wonder if the\r\nfather, with the two brothers, Friedel Max and Kasimir, will return from\r\nUlm in time for the \xe2\x80\x9cmid-day eating.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAh! there they are.  Quick-eyed Vittoria has seen the cavalcade first,\r\nand dances off to tell Ermentrude and Stine time enough to prepare their\r\nlast batch of fritters for the new-comers; Ebbo and G\xc3\xb6tz rush headlong\r\ndown the hillside; and the Lady Baroness lays down her distaff, and gazes\r\nwith eyes of satisfied content at the small party of horsemen climbing up\r\nthe footpath.  Then, when they have wound out of sight round a rock, she\r\nmoves out towards the hall-door, with a light, quick step, for never yet\r\nhas she resigned her great enjoyment, that of greeting her son on the\r\nsteps of the porch\xe2\x80\x94those steps where she once met such fearful news, but\r\nwhere that memory has been effaced by many a cheerful welcome.\r\n\r\nThere, then, she stands, amid the bright throng of grandchildren, while\r\nthe Baron and his sons spring from their horses and come up to her.  The\r\nBaron doffs his Spanish hat, bends the knee, kisses her hand, and\r\nreceives her kiss on his brow, with the fervour of a life-devotion,\r\nbefore he turns to accept the salutation of his daughters, and then takes\r\nher hand, with pretty affectionate ceremony, to hand her back to her\r\nseat.  A few words pass between them.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo, motherling,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsigned it not; I will tell you all by and by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then the mid-day meal is served for the whole household, as of old,\r\nwith the salt-cellar in the middle, but with a far larger company above\r\nit than when first we saw it.  The seven young folks preserve a decorous\r\nsilence, save when Fraulein Ermentrude\xe2\x80\x99s cookeries are good-naturedly\r\ncomplimented by her father, or when Baron Friedmund Maximilianus breaks\r\nout with some wonderful fact about new armour seen at Ulm.  He is a\r\nhandsome, fair, flaxen-haired young man\xe2\x80\x94like the old Adlersteins, say the\r\nelder people\xe2\x80\x94and full of honest gaiety and good nature, the special pride\r\nof his sisters; and no sooner is the meal over, than, with a formal\r\nentreaty for dismissal, all the seven, and all the dogs, move off\r\ntogether, to that favourite gathering-place round the stove, where all\r\ntheir merry tongues are let loose together.\r\n\r\nTo them, the Herr Vater and the Frau Grossmutter seem nearly of the same\r\nage, and of the same generation; and verily the eighteen years between\r\nthe mother and son have dwindled into a very small difference even in\r\nappearance, and a lesser one in feeling.  She is a youthful, beautiful\r\nold lady; he a grave, spare, worn, elderly man, in his full strength, but\r\nwith many a trace of care and thought, and far more of silver than of\r\nbrown in his thin hair and pointed beard, and with a melancholy\r\nthoughtfulness in his clear brown eyes\xe2\x80\x94all well corresponding with the\r\ngravity of the dress in which he has been meeting the burghers of Ulm; a\r\nblack velvet suit\xe2\x80\x94only relieved by his small white lace ruff, and the\r\nribbon and jewel of the Golden Fleece, the only other approach to\r\nornament that he wears being that ring long ago twisted off the Emperor\r\nMaximilian\xe2\x80\x99s chain.  But now, as he has bowed off the chaplain to his\r\nstudy, and excused himself from aiding his two gentlemen-squires in\r\nconsuming their krug of beer, and hands his mother to her favourite nook\r\nin the sunny window, taking his seat by her side, his features assume an\r\nexpression of repose and relaxation as if here indeed were his true home.\r\nHe has chosen his seat in full view of a picture that hangs on the\r\nwainscoted wall, near his mother\xe2\x80\x94a picture whose pure ethereal tinting,\r\nof colour limpid as the rainbow, yet rich as the most glowing\r\nflower-beds; and its soft lovely _pose_, and rounded outlines, prove it\r\nto be no produce even of one of the great German artists of the time, but\r\nto have been wrought, under an Italian sky, by such a hand as left us the\r\nmarvellous smile of Mona Lisa.  It represents two figures, one\r\nunmistakably himself when in the prime of life, his brow and cheeks\r\nunfurrowed, and his hair still thick, shining brown, but with the same\r\ngrave earnestness of the dark eye that came with the early sense of\r\nresponsibility, and with the first sorrow of his youth.  The other\r\nfigure, one on which the painter evidently loved to dwell, is of a lady,\r\nso young that she might almost pass for his daughter, except for the\r\npeculiar, tender sweetness that could only become the wife and mother.\r\nFair she is as snow, with scarce a deepening of the rose on cheek, or\r\neven lip, fragile and transparent as a spiritual form, and with a light\r\nin the blue eyes, and a grace in the soft fugitive smile, that scarce\r\nseems to belong to earth; a beauty not exactly of feature, but rather the\r\npathetic loveliness of calm fading away\xe2\x80\x94as if she were already melting\r\ninto the clear blue sky with the horizon of golden light, that the\r\nwondrous power of art has made to harmonize with, but not efface, her\r\nblue dress, golden hair, white coif, and fair skin.  It is as if she\r\nbelonged to that sky, and only tarried as unable to detach herself from\r\nthe clasp of the strong hand round and in which both her hands are\r\ntwined; and though the light in her face may be from heaven, yet the\r\nwhole countenance is fixed in one absorbed, almost worshipping gaze of\r\nher husband, with a wistful simplicity and innocence on devotion, like\r\nthe absorption of a loving animal, to whom its master\xe2\x80\x99s presence is bliss\r\nand sunshine.  It is a picture to make light in a dark place, and that\r\nsweet face receives a loving glance, nay, an absolutely reverent bend of\r\nthe knightly head, as the Baron seats himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it was as we feared, and this Schmalkaldic League did not suit thy\r\nsense of loyalty, my son?\xe2\x80\x9d she asks, reading his features anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, mother.  I ever feared that further pressure would drive our friends\r\nbeyond the line where begin schism and rebellion; and it seems to me that\r\nthe moment is come when I must hold me still, or transgress mine own\r\nsense of duty.  I must endure the displeasure of many I love and\r\nrespect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely, my son, they have known you too long and too well not to respect\r\nyour motives, and know that conscience is first with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScarce may such confidence be looked for, mother, from the most part,\r\nwho esteem every man a traitor to the cause if he defend it not precisely\r\nin the fashion of their own party.  But I hear that the King of France\r\nhas offered himself as an ally, and that Dr. Luther, together with others\r\nof our best divines, have thereby been startled into doubts of the\r\nlawfulness of the League.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what think you of doing, my son?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall endeavour to wait until such time as the much-needed General\r\nCouncil may proclaim the ancient truth, and enable us to avouch it\r\nwithout disunion.  Into schism I _will_ not be drawn.  I have held truth\r\nall my life in the Church, nor will I part from her now.  If intrigues\r\nagain should prevail, then, Heaven help us!  Meantime, mother, the best\r\nwe can, as has ever been your war-cry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd much has been won for us.  Here are the little maidens, who, save\r\nVittoria, would never have been scholars, reading the Holy Word daily in\r\ntheir own tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAch, I had not told you, mother!  I have the Court Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s answer\r\nthis day about that command in the Kaisar\xe2\x80\x99s guards that my dear old\r\nmaster had promised to his godson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother put-off with Flemish courtesy, I see by thy face, Ebbo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot quite that, mother.  The command is ready for the Baron Friedmund\r\nMaximilianus von Adlerstein Wildschloss, and all the rest of it, on the\r\nunderstanding that he has been bred up free from all taint of the new\r\ndoctrine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNew?  Nay, it is the oldest of all doctrine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so.  As I ever said, Dr. Luther hath been setting forth in greater\r\nclearness and fulness what our blessed Friedel and I learnt at your knee,\r\nand my young ones have learnt from babyhood of the true Catholic\r\ndoctrine.  Yet I may not call my son\xe2\x80\x99s faith such as the Kaisar\xe2\x80\x99s Spanish\r\nconscience-keepers would have it, and so the boy must e\xe2\x80\x99en tarry at home\r\ntill there be work for his stout arm to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seems little disappointed.  His laugh comes ringing the loudest of\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Junker is more of a boy at two-and-twenty than I ever recollect\r\nmyself!  He lacks not sense nor wit, but a fray or a feast, a chase or a\r\ndance, seem to suffice him at an age when I had long been dwelling on\r\nmatters of moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou wast left to be thine own pilot; he is but one of thy gay crew, and\r\nthus even these stirring times touch him not so deeply as thou wert\r\naffected by thine own choice in life between disorderly freedom and\r\nhonourable restraint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought of that choice to-day, mother, as I crossed the bridge and\r\nlooked at the church; and more than ever thankful did I feel that our\r\nblessed Friedel, having aided me over that one decisive pass, was laid to\r\nrest, his tender spirit unvexed by the shocks and divisions that have\r\nwrenched me hither and thither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay; not hither and thither.  Ever hadst thou a resolute purpose and\r\naim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEver failed in by my own error or that of others\xe2\x80\x94What, thou nestling\r\nhere, my little Vittoria, away from all yonder prattle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear father, if I may, I love far best to hear you and the grandmother\r\ntalk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear the child!  She alone hath your face, mother, or Friedel\xe2\x80\x99s eyes!\r\nIs it that thou wouldst be like thy noble Roman godmother, the Marchesa\r\ndi Pescara, that makes thee seek our grave company, little one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always long to hear you talk of her, and of the Italian days, dear\r\nfather, and how you won this noble jewel of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, child, that was before those times!  It was the gift of good Kaisar\r\nMax at his godson\xe2\x80\x99s christening, when he filled your sweet mother with\r\npretty spite by persuading her that it was a little golden bear-skin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell her how you had gained it, my son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy vapouring, child; and by the dull pride of my neighbours.  Heard\xe2\x80\x99st\r\nthou never of the siege of Padua, when we had Bayard, the best knight in\r\nEurope, and 500 Frenchmen for our allies?  Our artillery had made a\r\nbreach, and the Kaisar requested the French knights to lead the storm,\r\nwhereto they answered, Well and good, but our German nobles must share\r\nthe assault, and not leave them to fight with no better backers than the\r\nhired lanzknechts.  All in reason, quoth I, and more shame for us not to\r\nhave been foremost in our Kaisar\xe2\x80\x99s own cause; but what said the rest of\r\nour misproud chivalry?  They would never condescend to climb a wall on\r\nfoot in company with lanzknechts!  On horseback must their worships\r\nfight, or not at all; and when to shame them I called myself a\r\nmountaineer, more used to climb than to ride, and vowed that I should\r\nesteem it an honour to follow such a knight as Bayard, were it on all\r\nfours, then cast they my burgher blood in my teeth.  Never saw I the\r\nKaisar so enraged; he swore that all the common sense in the empire was\r\nin the burgher blood, and that he would make me a knight of the noblest\r\norder in Europe to show how he esteemed it.  And next morning he was\r\ngone!  So ashamed was he of his own army that he rode off in the night,\r\nand sent orders to break up the siege.  I could have torn my hair, for I\r\nhad just lashed up a few of our nobles to a better sense of honour, and\r\nwe would yet have redeemed our name!  And after all, the Chapter of proud\r\nFlemings would never have admitted me had not the heralds hunted up that\r\nthe Sorels were gentlemen of blood and coat armour long ago at Li\xc3\xa8ge.  I\r\nam glad my father lived to see that proved, mother.  He could not honour\r\nthee more than he did, but he would have been sorely grieved had I been\r\nrejected.  He often thought me a mechanical burgher, as it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot quite so, my son.  He never failed to be proud of thy deeds, even\r\nwhen he did not understand them; but this, and the grandson\xe2\x80\x99s birth, were\r\nthe crowning joys of his life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, those were glad triumphant years, take them all in all, ere the\r\nEmperor sent me to act ambassador in Rome, and we left you the two elder\r\nlittle girls and the boy to take care of.  My dear little Thekla!  She\r\nhad a foreboding that she might never see those children more, yet would\r\nshe have pined her heart away more surely had I left her at home!  I\r\nnever was absent a week but I found her wasted with watching for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was those weary seven years of Italy that changed thee most, my son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApart from you, mother, and knowing you now indeed to be widowed, and\r\nwith on the one hand such contradictory commands from the Emperor as made\r\nme sorely ashamed of myself, of my nation, and of the man whom I loved\r\nand esteemed personally the most on earth, yet bound there by his express\r\ncommand, while I saw my tender wife\xe2\x80\x99s health wasting in the climate day\r\nby day!  Yet still, while most she gasped for a breath of Swabian hills,\r\nshe ever declared it would kill her outright to send her from me.  And\r\nthus it went on till I laid her in the stately church of her own\r\npatroness.  Then how it would have fared with me and the helpless little\r\nones I know not, but for thy noble godmother, my Vittoria, the wise and\r\nready helper of all in trouble, the only friend thy mother had made at\r\nRome, and who had been able, from all her heights of learning and\r\naccomplishment, to value my Thekla\xe2\x80\x99s golden soul in its simplicity.  Even\r\nthen, when too late, came one of the Kaisar\xe2\x80\x99s kindest letters, recalling\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x94a letter whose every word I would have paid for with a drop of my own\r\nblood six weeks before! and which he had only failed to send because his\r\nhead was running on the plan of that gorgeous tomb where he is not\r\nburied!  Well, at least it brought us home to you again once more,\r\nmother, and, where you are, comfort never has been utterly absent from\r\nme.  And then, coming from the wilful gloom of Pope Leo\xe2\x80\x99s court into our\r\nGermany, streamed over by the rays of Luther\xe2\x80\x99s light, it was as if a new\r\nworld of hope were dawning, as if truth would no longer be muffled, and\r\nthe young would grow up to a world far better and purer than the old had\r\never seen.  What trumpet-calls those were, and how welcome was the voice\r\nof the true Catholic faith no longer stifled!  And my dear old Kaisar,\r\nwith his clear eyes, his unfettered mind\xe2\x80\x94he felt the power and truth of\r\nthose theses.  He bade the Elector of Saxony well to guard the monk\r\nLuther as a treasure.  Ah! had he been a younger man, or had he been more\r\nfirm and resolute, able to act as well as think for himself, things might\r\nhave gone otherwise with the Church.  He could think, but could not act;\r\nand now we have a man who acts, but _will_ not think.  It may have been a\r\ngood day for our German reputation among foreign princes when Charles V.\r\nput on the crown; but only two days in my life have been as mournful to\r\nme as that when I stood by Kaisar Max\xe2\x80\x99s death-bed at Wells, and knew that\r\ngenerous, loving, fitful spirit was passing away from the earth!  Never\r\nowned I friend I loved so well as Kaisar Max!  Nor has any Emperor done\r\nso much for this our dear land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe young Emperor never loved thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe might have treated me as one who could be useful, but he never\r\nforgave me for shaking hands with Luther at the Diet of Worms.  I knew it\r\nwas all over with my court favour after I had joined in escorting the\r\nDoctor out of the city.  And the next thing was that Georg of Freundsberg\r\nand his friends proclaimed me a bigoted Papist because I did my utmost to\r\nkeep my troop out of the devil\xe2\x80\x99s holiday at the sack of Rome!  It has\r\never been my lot to be in disgrace with one side or the other!  Here is\r\nmy daughter\xe2\x80\x99s marriage hindered on the one hand, my son\xe2\x80\x99s promotion\r\nchecked on the other, because I have a conscience of my own, and not of\r\nother people\xe2\x80\x99s!  Heaven knows the right is no easy matter to find; but,\r\nwhen one thinks one sees it, there is nothing to be done but to guide\r\noneself by it, even if the rest of the world will not view it in the same\r\nlight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing else!  I doubt me whether it be ever easy to see the veritably\r\nright course while still struggling in the midst.  That is for after\r\nages, which behold things afar off; but each man must needs follow his\r\nown principle in an honest and good heart, and assuredly God will guide\r\nhim to work out some good end, or hinder some evil one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, mother.  Each party may guard one side or other of the truth in all\r\nhonesty and faithfulness; he who cannot with his whole heart cast in his\r\nlot with either,\xe2\x80\x94he is apt to serve no purpose, and to be scorned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Ebbo, may he not be a witness to the higher and more perfect truth\r\nthan either party have conceived?  Nor is inaction always needful.  That\r\nwhich is right towards either side still reveals itself at the due\r\nmoment, whether it be to act or to hold still.  And verily, Ebbo, what\r\nthou didst say even now has set me on a strange thought of mine own\r\ndream, that which heralded the birth of thyself and thy brother.  As thou\r\nknowest, it seemed to me that I was watching two sparkles from the\r\nextinguished Needfire wheel.  One rose aloft and shone as a star!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy guiding-star!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe other fulfilled those words of the Wise Man.  It shone and ran to\r\nand fro in the grass.  And surely, my Ebbo, thy mother may feel that, in\r\nall these dark days of perplexity and trial, the spark of light hath ever\r\nshone and drawn its trail of brightness in the gloom, even though the way\r\nwas long, and seemed uncertain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mother who ever fondled me _will_ think so, it may be!  But, ah! she\r\nhad better pray that the light be clearer, and that I may not fall\r\nutterly short of the star!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nTravellers in Wurtemburg may perhaps turn aside from glorious old Ulm,\r\nand the memories of the battlefields around it, to the romantic country\r\nround the Swabian mountains, through which descend the tributaries of the\r\nDanube.  Here they may think themselves fortunate if they come upon a\r\ngreen valley, with a bright mountain torrent dashing through it, fresh\r\nfrom the lofty mountain, with terraced sides that rise sheer above.  An\r\nold bridge, a mill, and a neat German village lie clustered in the\r\nvalley; a seignorial mansion peeps out of the forest glades; and a lovely\r\nchurch, of rather late Gothic, but beautifully designed, attracts the eye\r\nso soon as it can be persuaded to quit the romantic outline of the ruined\r\nbaronial castle high up on one of the mountain ledges.  Report declares\r\nthat there are tombs in the church well worth inspection.  You seek out\r\nan old venerable blue-coated peasant who has charge of the church.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is yonder castle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the castle of Adlerstein.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre the family still extant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea, yea; they built yonder house when the Schloss became ruinous.  They\r\nhave always been here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe church is very beautiful in its details, the carved work of the east\r\nend and pulpit especially so, but nothing is so attractive as the altar\r\ntomb in the chantry chapel.  It is a double one, holding not, as usual,\r\nthe recumbent effigies of a husband and wife, but of two knights in\r\narmour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are these, good friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are the good Barons Ebbo and Friedel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFather and son they appear to be, killed at the same time in some fatal\r\nbattle, for the white marble face of one is round with youth, no hair on\r\nlip nor chin, and with a lovely peaceful solemnity, almost cheerfulness,\r\nin the expression.  The other, a bearded man, has the glory of old age in\r\nhis worn features, beautiful and restful, but it is as if one had gone to\r\nsleep in the light of dawn, the other in the last glow of sunset.  Their\r\narmour and their crests are alike, but the young one bears the eagle\r\nshield alone, while the elder has the same bearing repeated upon an\r\nescutcheon of pretence; the young man\xe2\x80\x99s hands are clasped over a harp,\r\nthose of the other over a Bible, and the elder wears the insignia of the\r\norder of the Golden Fleece.  They are surely father and son, a maiden\r\nknight and tried warrior who fell together?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d the guide shakes his head; \xe2\x80\x9cthey are twin brothers, the good Barons\r\nEbbo and Friedel, who were born when their father had been taken captive\r\nby the Saracens while on a crusade.  Baron Friedel was slain by the Turks\r\nat the bridge foot, and his brother built the church in his memory.  He\r\nfirst planted vines upon the mountains, and freed the peasants from the\r\nlord\xe2\x80\x99s dues on their flax.  And it is true that the two brothers may\r\nstill be seen hovering on the mountain-side in the mist at sunset,\r\nsometimes one, sometimes both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYou turn with a smile to the inscription, sure that those windows, those\r\nporches, that armour, never were of crusading date, and ready to refute\r\nthe old peasant.  You spell out the upright Gothic letters around the\r\ncornice of the tomb, and you read, in medi\xc3\xa6val Latin,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cOrate pro Anima Friedmundis Equitis Baronis Adlersteini.  A. D.\r\n    mccccxciii\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen turn to the other side and read\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cHic jacet Eberardus Eques Baro Adlersteini.  A.D. mdxliii.  Demum\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, the guide is right.  They are brothers, with well-nigh a lifetime\r\nbetween their deaths.  Is that the meaning of that strange _Demum_?\r\n\r\nFew of the other tombs are worth attention, each lapsing further into the\r\nbad taste of later ages; yet there is one still deserving admiration,\r\nplaced close to the head of that of the two Barons.  It is the effigy of\r\na lady, aged and serene, with a delicately-carved face beneath her stiff\r\nhead-gear.  Surely this monument was erected somewhat later, for the\r\ninscription is in German.  Stiff, contracted, hard to read, but this is\r\nthe rendering of it:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cHere lies Christina Sorel, wife of Eberhard, xxth Baron von\r\n    Adlerstein, and mother of the Barons Eberhard and Friedmund.  She\r\n    fell asleep two days before her son, on the feast of St. John,\r\n    mdxliii.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cHer children shall rise up and call her blessed.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cErected with full hearts by her grandson, Baron Friedmund\r\n    Maximilianus, and his brothers and sisters.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\r\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
