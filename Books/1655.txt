Here the struggle for survival continued to wage\r\nwith all its ancient brutality.  Briton and Russian were still to overlap\r\nin the Land of the Rainbow\'s End--and this was the very heart of it--nor\r\nhad Yankee gold yet purchased its vast domain.  The wolf-pack still clung\r\nto the flank of the cariboo-herd, singling out the weak and the big with\r\ncalf, and pulling them down as remorselessly as were it a thousand,\r\nthousand generations into the past.  The sparse aborigines still\r\nacknowledged the rule of their chiefs and medicine men, drove out bad\r\nspirits, burned their witches, fought their neighbors, and ate their\r\nenemies with a relish which spoke well of their bellies.  But it was at\r\nthe moment when the stone age was drawing to a close.  Already, over\r\nunknown trails and chartless wildernesses, were the harbingers of the\r\nsteel arriving,--fair-faced, blue-eyed, indomitable men, incarnations of\r\nthe unrest of their race.  By accident or design, single-handed and in\r\ntwos and threes, they came from no one knew whither, and fought, or died,\r\nor passed on, no one knew whence.  The priests raged against them, the\r\nchiefs called forth their fighting men, and stone clashed with steel; but\r\nto little purpose.  Like water seeping from some mighty reservoir, they\r\ntrickled through the dark forests and mountain passes, threading the\r\nhighways in bark canoes, or with their moccasined feet breaking trail for\r\nthe wolf-dogs.  They came of a great breed, and their mothers were many;\r\nbut the fur-clad denizens of the Northland had this yet to learn.  So\r\nmany an unsung wanderer fought his last and died under the cold fire of\r\nthe aurora, as did his brothers in burning sands and reeking jungles, and\r\nas they shall continue to do till in the fulness of time the destiny of\r\ntheir race be achieved.\r\n\r\nIt was near twelve.  Along the northern horizon a rosy glow, fading to\r\nthe west and deepening to the east, marked the unseen dip of the midnight\r\nsun.  The gloaming and the dawn were so commingled that there was no\r\nnight,--simply a wedding of day with day, a scarcely perceptible blending\r\nof two circles of the sun.  A kildee timidly chirped good-night; the\r\nfull, rich throat of a robin proclaimed good-morrow.  From an island on\r\nthe breast of the Yukon a colony of wild fowl voiced its interminable\r\nwrongs, while a loon laughed mockingly back across a still stretch of\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nIn the foreground, against the bank of a lazy eddy, birch-bark canoes\r\nwere lined two and three deep.  Ivory-bladed spears, bone-barbed arrows,\r\nbuckskin-thonged bows, and simple basket-woven traps bespoke the fact\r\nthat in the muddy current of the river the salmon-run was on.  In the\r\nbackground, from the tangle of skin tents and drying frames, rose the\r\nvoices of the fisher folk.  Bucks skylarked with bucks or flirted with\r\nthe maidens, while the older squaws, shut out from this by virtue of\r\nhaving fulfilled the end of their existence in reproduction, gossiped as\r\nthey braided rope from the green roots of trailing vines.  At their feet\r\ntheir naked progeny played and squabbled, or rolled in the muck with the\r\ntawny wolf-dogs.\r\n\r\nTo one side of the encampment, and conspicuously apart from it, stood a\r\nsecond camp of two tents.  But it was a white man\'s camp.  If nothing\r\nelse, the choice of position at least bore convincing evidence of this.\r\nIn case of offence, it commanded the Indian quarters a hundred yards\r\naway; of defence, a rise to the ground and the cleared intervening space;\r\nand last, of defeat, the swift slope of a score of yards to the canoes\r\nbelow.  From one of the tents came the petulant cry of a sick child and\r\nthe crooning song of a mother.  In the open, over the smouldering embers\r\nof a fire, two men held talk.\r\n\r\n"Eh?  I love the church like a good son.  _Bien_!  So great a love that\r\nmy days have been spent in fleeing away from her, and my nights in\r\ndreaming dreams of reckoning.  Look you!"  The half-breed\'s voice rose to\r\nan angry snarl.  "I am Red River born.  My father was white--as white as\r\nyou.  But you are Yankee, and he was British bred, and a gentleman\'s son.\r\nAnd my mother was the daughter of a chief, and I was a man.  Ay, and one\r\nhad to look the second time to see what manner of blood ran in my veins;\r\nfor I lived with the whites, and was one of them, and my father\'s heart\r\nbeat in me.  It happened there was a maiden--white--who looked on me with\r\nkind eyes.  Her father had much land and many horses; also he was a big\r\nman among his people, and his blood was the blood of the French.  He said\r\nthe girl knew not her own mind, and talked overmuch with her, and became\r\nwroth that such things should be.\r\n\r\n"But she knew her mind, for we came quick before the priest.  And quicker\r\nhad come her father, with lying words, false promises, I know not what;\r\nso that the priest stiffened his neck and would not make us that we might\r\nlive one with the other.  As at the beginning it was the church which\r\nwould not bless my birth, so now it was the church which refused me\r\nmarriage and put the blood of men upon my hands.  _Bien_!  Thus have I\r\ncause to love the church.  So I struck the priest on his woman\'s mouth,\r\nand we took swift horses, the girl and I, to Fort Pierre, where was a\r\nminister of good heart.  But hot on our trail was her father, and\r\nbrothers, and other men he had gathered to him.  And we fought, our\r\nhorses on the run, till I emptied three saddles and the rest drew off and\r\nwent on to Fort Pierre.  Then we took east, the girl and I, to the hills\r\nand forests, and we lived one with the other, and we were not\r\nmarried,--the work of the good church which I love like a son.\r\n\r\n"But mark you, for this is the strangeness of woman, the way of which no\r\nman may understand.  One of the saddles I emptied was that of her\r\nfather\'s, and the hoofs of those who came behind had pounded him into the\r\nearth.  This we saw, the girl and I, and this I had forgot had she not\r\nremembered.  And in the quiet of the evening, after the day\'s hunt were\r\ndone, it came between us, and in the silence of the night when we lay\r\nbeneath the stars and should have been one.  It was there always.  She\r\nnever spoke, but it sat by our fire and held us ever apart.  She tried to\r\nput it aside, but at such times it would rise up till I could read it in\r\nthe look of her eyes, in the very intake of her breath.\r\n\r\n"So in the end she bore me a child, a woman-child, and died.  Then I went\r\namong my mother\'s people, that it might nurse at a warm breast and live.\r\nBut my hands were wet with the blood of men, look you, because of the\r\nchurch, wet with the blood of men.  And the Riders of the North came for\r\nme, but my mother\'s brother, who was then chief in his own right, hid me\r\nand gave me horses and food.  And we went away, my woman-child and I,\r\neven to the Hudson Bay Country, where white men were few and the\r\nquestions they asked not many.  And I worked for the company a hunter, as\r\na guide, as a driver of dogs, till my woman-child was become a woman,\r\ntall, and slender, and fair to the eye.\r\n\r\n"You know the winter, long and lonely, breeding evil thoughts and bad\r\ndeeds.  The Chief Factor was a hard man, and bold.  And he was not such\r\nthat a woman would delight in looking upon.  But he cast eyes upon my\r\nwoman-child who was become a woman.  Mother of God! he sent me away on a\r\nlong trip with the dogs, that he might--you understand, he was a hard man\r\nand without heart.  She was most white, and her soul was white, and a\r\ngood woman, and--well, she died.\r\n\r\n"It was bitter cold the night of my return, and I had been away months,\r\nand the dogs were limping sore when I came to the fort.  The Indians and\r\nbreeds looked on me in silence, and I felt the fear of I knew not what,\r\nbut I said nothing till the dogs were fed and I had eaten as a man with\r\nwork before him should.  Then I spoke up, demanding the word, and they\r\nshrank from me, afraid of my anger and what I should do; but the story\r\ncame out, the pitiful story, word for word and act for act, and they\r\nmarvelled that I should be so quiet.\r\n\r\n"When they had done I went to the Factor\'s house, calmer than now in the\r\ntelling of it.  He had been afraid and called upon the breeds to help\r\nhim; but they were not pleased with the deed, and had left him to lie on\r\nthe bed he had made.  So he had fled to the house of the priest.  Thither\r\nI followed.  But when I was come to that place, the priest stood in my\r\nway, and spoke soft words, and said a man in anger should go neither to\r\nthe right nor left, but straight to God.  I asked by the right of a\r\nfather\'s wrath that he give me past, but he said only over his body, and\r\nbesought with me to pray.  Look you, it was the church, always the\r\nchurch; for I passed over his body and sent the Factor to meet my woman-\r\nchild before his god, which is a bad god, and the god of the white men.\r\n\r\n"Then was there hue and cry, for word was sent to the station below, and\r\nI came away.  Through the Land of the Great Slave, down the Valley of the\r\nMackenzie to the never-opening ice, over the White Rockies, past the\r\nGreat Curve of the Yukon, even to this place did I come.  And from that\r\nday to this, yours is the first face of my father\'s people I have looked\r\nupon.  May it be the last!  These people, which are my people, are a\r\nsimple folk, and I have been raised to honor among them.  My word is\r\ntheir law, and their priests but do my bidding, else would I not suffer\r\nthem.  When I speak for them I speak for myself.  We ask to be let alone.\r\nWe do not want your kind.  If we permit you to sit by our fires, after\r\nyou will come your church, your priests, and your gods.  And know this,\r\nfor each white man who comes to my village, him will I make deny his god.\r\nYou are the first, and I give you grace.  So it were well you go, and go\r\nquickly."\r\n\r\n"I am not responsible for my brothers," the second man spoke up, filling\r\nhis pipe in a meditative manner.  Hay Stockard was at times as thoughtful\r\nof speech as he was wanton of action; but only at times.\r\n\r\n"But I know your breed," responded the other.  "Your brothers are many,\r\nand it is you and yours who break the trail for them to follow.  In time\r\nthey shall come to possess the land, but not in my time.  Already, have I\r\nheard, are they on the head-reaches of the Great River, and far away\r\nbelow are the Russians."\r\n\r\nHay Stockard lifted his head with a quick start.  This was startling\r\ngeographical information.  The Hudson Bay post at Fort Yukon had other\r\nnotions concerning the course of the river, believing it to flow into the\r\nArctic.\r\n\r\n"Then the Yukon empties into Bering Sea?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I do not know, but below there are Russians, many Russians.  Which is\r\nneither here nor there.  You may go on and see for yourself; you may go\r\nback to your brothers; but up the Koyukuk you shall not go while the\r\npriests and fighting men do my bidding.  Thus do I command, I, Baptiste\r\nthe Red, whose word is law and who am head man over this people."\r\n\r\n"And should I not go down to the Russians, or back to my brothers?"\r\n\r\n"Then shall you go swift-footed before your god, which is a bad god, and\r\nthe god of the white men."\r\n\r\nThe red sun shot up above the northern sky-line, dripping and bloody.\r\nBaptiste the Red came to his feet, nodded curtly, and went back to his\r\ncamp amid the crimson shadows and the singing of the robins.\r\n\r\nHay Stockard finished his pipe by the fire, picturing in smoke and coal\r\nthe unknown upper reaches of the Koyukuk, the strange stream which ended\r\nhere its arctic travels and merged its waters with the muddy Yukon flood.\r\nSomewhere up there, if the dying words of a ship-wrecked sailorman who\r\nhad made the fearful overland journey were to be believed, and if the\r\nvial of golden grains in his pouch attested anything,--somewhere up\r\nthere, in that home of winter, stood the Treasure House of the North.  And\r\nas keeper of the gate, Baptiste the Red, English half-breed and renegade,\r\nbarred the way.\r\n\r\n"Bah!"  He kicked the embers apart and rose to his full height, arms\r\nlazily outstretched, facing the flushing north with careless soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nHay Stockard swore, harshly, in the rugged monosyllables of his mother\r\ntongue.  His wife lifted her gaze from the pots and pans, and followed\r\nhis in a keen scrutiny of the river.  She was a woman of the Teslin\r\nCountry, wise in the ways of her husband\'s vernacular when it grew\r\nintensive.  From the slipping of a snow-shoe thong to the forefront of\r\nsudden death, she could gauge occasion by the pitch and volume of his\r\nblasphemy.  So she knew the present occasion merited attention.  A long\r\ncanoe, with paddles flashing back the rays of the westering sun, was\r\ncrossing the current from above and urging in for the eddy.  Hay Stockard\r\nwatched it intently.  Three men rose and dipped, rose and dipped, in\r\nrhythmical precision; but a red bandanna, wrapped about the head of one,\r\ncaught and held his eye.\r\n\r\n"Bill!" he called.  "Oh, Bill!"\r\n\r\nA shambling, loose-jointed giant rolled out of one of the tents, yawning\r\nand rubbing the sleep from his eyes.  Then he sighted the strange canoe\r\nand was wide awake on the instant.\r\n\r\n"By the jumping Methuselah!  That damned sky-pilot!"\r\n\r\nHay Stockard nodded his head bitterly, half-reached for his rifle, then\r\nshrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Pot-shot him," Bill suggested, "and settle the thing out of hand.  He\'ll\r\nspoil us sure if we don\'t."  But the other declined this drastic measure\r\nand turned away, at the same time bidding the woman return to her work,\r\nand calling Bill back from the bank.  The two Indians in the canoe moored\r\nit on the edge of the eddy, while its white occupant, conspicuous by his\r\ngorgeous head-gear, came up the bank.\r\n\r\n"Like Paul of Tarsus, I give you greeting.  Peace be unto you and grace\r\nbefore the Lord."\r\n\r\nHis advances were met sullenly, and without speech.\r\n\r\n"To you, Hay Stockard, blasphemer and Philistine, greeting.  In your\r\nheart is the lust of Mammon, in your mind cunning devils, in your tent\r\nthis woman whom you live with in adultery; yet of these divers sins, even\r\nhere in the wilderness, I, Sturges Owen, apostle to the Lord, bid you to\r\nrepent and cast from you your iniquities."\r\n\r\n"Save your cant!  Save your cant!" Hay Stockard broke in testily.  "You\'ll\r\nneed all you\'ve got, and more, for Red Baptiste over yonder."\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand toward the Indian camp, where the half-breed was\r\nlooking steadily across, striving to make out the newcomers.  Sturges\r\nOwen, disseminator of light and apostle to the Lord, stepped to the edge\r\nof the steep and commanded his men to bring up the camp outfit.  Stockard\r\nfollowed him.\r\n\r\n"Look here," he demanded, plucking the missionary by the shoulder and\r\ntwirling him about.  "Do you value your hide?"\r\n\r\n"My life is in the Lord\'s keeping, and I do but work in His vineyard," he\r\nreplied solemnly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, stow that!  Are you looking for a job of martyrship?"\r\n\r\n"If He so wills."\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'ll find it right here, but I\'m going to give you some advice\r\nfirst.  Take it or leave it.  If you stop here, you\'ll be cut off in the\r\nmidst of your labors.  And not you alone, but your men, Bill, my wife--"\r\n\r\n"Who is a daughter of Belial and hearkeneth not to the true Gospel."\r\n\r\n"And myself.  Not only do you bring trouble upon yourself, but upon us.  I\r\nwas frozen in with you last winter, as you will well recollect, and I\r\nknow you for a good man and a fool.  If you think it your duty to strive\r\nwith the heathen, well and good; but, do exercise some wit in the way you\r\ngo about it.  This man, Red Baptiste, is no Indian.  He comes of our\r\ncommon stock, is as bull-necked as I ever dared be, and as wild a fanatic\r\nthe one way as you are the other.  When you two come together, hell\'ll be\r\nto pay, and I don\'t care to be mixed up in it.  Understand?  So take my\r\nadvice and go away.  If you go down-stream, you\'ll fall in with the\r\nRussians.  There\'s bound to be Greek priests among them, and they\'ll see\r\nyou safe through to Bering Sea,--that\'s where the Yukon empties,--and\r\nfrom there it won\'t be hard to get back to civilization.  Take my word\r\nfor it and get out of here as fast as God\'ll let you."\r\n\r\n"He who carries the Lord in his heart and the Gospel in his hand hath no\r\nfear of the machinations of man or devil," the missionary answered\r\nstoutly.  "I will see this man and wrestle with him.  One backslider\r\nreturned to the fold is a greater victory than a thousand heathen.  He\r\nwho is strong for evil can be as mighty for good, witness Saul when he\r\njourneyed up to Damascus to bring Christian captives to Jerusalem.  And\r\nthe voice of the Saviour came to him, crying, \'Saul, Saul, why\r\npersecutest thou me?\'  And therewith Paul arrayed himself on the side of\r\nthe Lord, and thereafter was most mighty in the saving of souls.  And\r\neven as thou, Paul of Tarsus, even so do I work in the vineyard of the\r\nLord, bearing trials and tribulations, scoffs and sneers, stripes and\r\npunishments, for His dear sake."\r\n\r\n"Bring up the little bag with the tea and a kettle of water," he called\r\nthe next instant to his boatmen; "not forgetting the haunch of cariboo\r\nand the mixing-pan."\r\n\r\nWhen his men, converts by his own hand, had gained the bank, the trio\r\nfell to their knees, hands and backs burdened with camp equipage, and\r\noffered up thanks for their passage through the wilderness and their safe\r\narrival.  Hay Stockard looked upon the function with sneering\r\ndisapproval, the romance and solemnity of it lost to his matter-of-fact\r\nsoul.  Baptiste the Red, still gazing across, recognized the familiar\r\npostures, and remembered the girl who had shared his star-roofed couch in\r\nthe hills and forests, and the woman-child who lay somewhere by bleak\r\nHudson\'s Bay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n"Confound it, Baptiste, couldn\'t think of it.  Not for a moment.  Grant\r\nthat this man is a fool and of small use in the nature of things, but\r\nstill, you know, I can\'t give him up."\r\n\r\nHay Stockard paused, striving to put into speech the rude ethics of his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n"He\'s worried me, Baptiste, in the past and now, and caused me all manner\r\nof troubles; but can\'t you see, he\'s my own breed--white--and--and--why,\r\nI couldn\'t buy my life with his, not if he was a nigger."\r\n\r\n"So be it," Baptiste the Red made answer.  "I have given you grace and\r\nchoice.  I shall come presently, with my priests and fighting men, and\r\neither shall I kill you, or you deny your god.  Give up the priest to my\r\npleasure, and you shall depart in peace.  Otherwise your trail ends here.\r\nMy people are against you to the babies.  Even now have the children\r\nstolen away your canoes."  He pointed down to the river.  Naked boys had\r\nslipped down the water from the point above, cast loose the canoes, and\r\nby then had worked them into the current.  When they had drifted out of\r\nrifle-shot they clambered over the sides and paddled ashore.\r\n\r\n"Give me the priest, and you may have them back again.  Come!  Speak your\r\nmind, but without haste."\r\n\r\nStockard shook his head.  His glance dropped to the woman of the Teslin\r\nCountry with his boy at her breast, and he would have wavered had he not\r\nlifted his eyes to the men before him.\r\n\r\n"I am not afraid," Sturges Owen spoke up.  "The Lord bears me in his\r\nright hand, and alone am I ready to go into the camp of the unbeliever.\r\nIt is not too late.  Faith may move mountains.  Even in the eleventh hour\r\nmay I win his soul to the true righteousness."\r\n\r\n"Trip the beggar up and make him fast," Bill whispered hoarsely in the\r\near of his leader, while the missionary kept the floor and wrestled with\r\nthe heathen.  "Make him hostage, and bore him if they get ugly."\r\n\r\n"No," Stockard answered.  "I gave him my word that he could speak with us\r\nunmolested.  Rules of warfare, Bill; rules of warfare.  He\'s been on the\r\nsquare, given us warning, and all that, and--why, damn it, man, I can\'t\r\nbreak my word!"\r\n\r\n"He\'ll keep his, never fear."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t doubt it, but I won\'t let a half-breed outdo me in fair dealing.\r\nWhy not do what he wants,--give him the missionary and be done with it?"\r\n\r\n"N-no," Bill hesitated doubtfully.\r\n\r\n"Shoe pinches, eh?"\r\n\r\nBill flushed a little and dropped the discussion.  Baptiste the Red was\r\nstill waiting the final decision.  Stockard went up to him.\r\n\r\n"It\'s this way, Baptiste.  I came to your village minded to go up the\r\nKoyukuk.  I intended no wrong.  My heart was clean of evil.  It is still\r\nclean.  Along comes this priest, as you call him.  I didn\'t bring him\r\nhere.  He\'d have come whether I was here or not.  But now that he is\r\nhere, being of my people, I\'ve got to stand by him.  And I\'m going to.\r\nFurther, it will be no child\'s play.  When you have done, your village\r\nwill be silent and empty, your people wasted as after a famine.  True, we\r\nwill he gone; likewise the pick of your fighting men--"\r\n\r\n"But those who remain shall be in peace, nor shall the word of strange\r\ngods and the tongues of strange priests be buzzing in their ears."\r\n\r\nBoth men shrugged their shoulder and turned away, the half-breed going\r\nback to his own camp.  The missionary called his two men to him, and they\r\nfell into prayer.  Stockard and Bill attacked the few standing pines with\r\ntheir axes, felling them into convenient breastworks.  The child had\r\nfallen asleep, so the woman placed it on a heap of furs and lent a hand\r\nin fortifying the camp.  Three sides were thus defended, the steep\r\ndeclivity at the rear precluding attack from that direction.  When these\r\narrangements had been completed, the two men stalked into the open,\r\nclearing away, here and there, the scattered underbrush.  From the\r\nopposing camp came the booming of war-drums and the voices of the priests\r\nstirring the people to anger.\r\n\r\n"Worst of it is they\'ll come in rushes," Bill complained as they walked\r\nback with shouldered axes.\r\n\r\n"And wait till midnight, when the light gets dim for shooting."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t start the ball a-rolling too early, then."  Bill exchanged the axe\r\nfor a rifle, and took a careful rest.  One of the medicine-men, towering\r\nabove his tribesmen, stood out distinctly.  Bill drew a bead on him.\r\n\r\n"All ready?" he asked.\r\n\r\nStockard opened the ammunition box, placed the woman where she could\r\nreload in safety, and gave the word.  The medicine-man dropped.  For a\r\nmoment there was silence, then a wild howl went up and a flight of bone\r\narrows fell short.\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to take a look at the beggar," Bill remarked, throwing a fresh\r\nshell into place.  "I\'ll swear I drilled him clean between the eyes."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t work."  Stockard shook his head gloomily.  Baptiste had evidently\r\nquelled the more warlike of his followers, and instead of precipitating\r\nan attack in the bright light of day, the shot had caused a hasty exodus,\r\nthe Indians drawing out of the village beyond the zone of fire.\r\n\r\nIn the full tide of his proselyting fervor, borne along by the hand of\r\nGod, Sturges Owen would have ventured alone into the camp of the\r\nunbeliever, equally prepared for miracle or martyrdom; but in the waiting\r\nwhich ensued, the fever of conviction died away gradually, as the natural\r\nman asserted itself.  Physical fear replaced spiritual hope; the love of\r\nlife, the love of God.  It was no new experience.  He could feel his\r\nweakness coming on, and knew it of old time.  He had struggled against it\r\nand been overcome by it before.  He remembered when the other men had\r\ndriven their paddles like mad in the van of a roaring ice-flood, how, at\r\nthe critical moment, in a panic of worldly terror, he had dropped his\r\npaddle and besought wildly with his God for pity.  And there were other\r\ntimes.  The recollection was not pleasant.  It brought shame to him that\r\nhis spirit should be so weak and his flesh so strong.  But the love of\r\nlife! the love of life!  He could not strip it from him.  Because of it\r\nhad his dim ancestors perpetuated their line; because of it was he\r\ndestined to perpetuate his.  His courage, if courage it might be called,\r\nwas bred of fanaticism.  The courage of Stockard and Bill was the\r\nadherence to deep-rooted ideals.  Not that the love of life was less, but\r\nthe love of race tradition more; not that they were unafraid to die, but\r\nthat they were brave enough not to live at the price of shame.\r\n\r\nThe missionary rose, for the moment swayed by the mood of sacrifice.  He\r\nhalf crawled over the barricade to proceed to the other camp, but sank\r\nback, a trembling mass, wailing: "As the spirit moves!  As the spirit\r\nmoves!  Who am I that I should set aside the judgments of God?  Before\r\nthe foundations of the world were all things written in the book of life.\r\nWorm that I am, shall I erase the page or any portion thereof?  As God\r\nwills, so shall the spirit move!"\r\n\r\nBill reached over, plucked him to his feet, and shook him, fiercely,\r\nsilently.  Then he dropped the bundle of quivering nerves and turned his\r\nattention to the two converts.  But they showed little fright and a\r\ncheerful alacrity in preparing for the coming passage at arms.\r\n\r\nStockard, who had been talking in undertones with the Teslin woman, now\r\nturned to the missionary.\r\n\r\n"Fetch him over here," he commanded of Bill.\r\n\r\n"Now," he ordered, when Sturges Owen had been duly deposited before him,\r\n"make us man and wife, and be lively about it."  Then he added\r\napologetically to Bill: "No telling how it\'s to end, so I just thought\r\nI\'d get my affairs straightened up."\r\n\r\nThe woman obeyed the behest of her white lord.  To her the ceremony was\r\nmeaningless.  By her lights she was his wife, and had been from the day\r\nthey first foregathered.  The converts served as witnesses.  Bill stood\r\nover the missionary, prompting him when he stumbled.  Stockard put the\r\nresponses in the woman\'s mouth, and when the time came, for want of\r\nbetter, ringed her finger with thumb and forefinger of his own.\r\n\r\n"Kiss the bride!" Bill thundered, and Sturges Owen was too weak to\r\ndisobey.\r\n\r\n"Now baptize the child!"\r\n\r\n"Neat and tidy," Bill commented.\r\n\r\n"Gathering the proper outfit for a new trail," the father explained,\r\ntaking the boy from the mother\'s arms.  "I was grub-staked, once, into\r\nthe Cascades, and had everything in the kit except salt.  Never shall\r\nforget it.  And if the woman and the kid cross the divide to-night they\r\nmight as well be prepared for pot-luck.  A long shot, Bill, between\r\nourselves, but nothing lost if it misses."\r\n\r\nA cup of water served the purpose, and the child was laid away in a\r\nsecure corner of the barricade.  The men built the fire, and the evening\r\nmeal was cooked.\r\n\r\nThe sun hurried round to the north, sinking closer to the horizon.  The\r\nheavens in that quarter grew red and bloody.  The shadows lengthened, the\r\nlight dimmed, and in the sombre recesses of the forest life slowly died\r\naway.  Even the wild fowl in the river softened their raucous chatter and\r\nfeigned the nightly farce of going to bed.  Only the tribesmen increased\r\ntheir clamor, war-drums booming and voices raised in savage folk songs.\r\nBut as the sun dipped they ceased their tumult.  The rounded hush of\r\nmidnight was complete.  Stockard rose to his knees and peered over the\r\nlogs.  Once the child wailed in pain and disconcerted him.  The mother\r\nbent over it, but it slept again.  The silence was interminable,\r\nprofound.  Then, of a sudden, the robins burst into full-throated song.\r\nThe night had passed.\r\n\r\nA flood of dark figures boiled across the open.  Arrows whistled and bow-\r\nthongs sang.  The shrill-tongued rifles answered back.  A spear, and a\r\nmighty cast, transfixed the Teslin woman as she hovered above the child.\r\nA spent arrow, diving between the logs, lodged in the missionary\'s arm.\r\n\r\nThere was no stopping the rush.  The middle distance was cumbered with\r\nbodies, but the rest surged on, breaking against and over the barricade\r\nlike an ocean wave.  Sturges Owen fled to the tent, while the men were\r\nswept from their feet, buried beneath the human tide.  Hay Stockard alone\r\nregained the surface, flinging the tribesmen aside like yelping curs.  He\r\nhad managed to seize an axe.  A dark hand grasped the child by a naked\r\nfoot, and drew it from beneath its mother.  At arm\'s length its puny body\r\ncircled through the air, dashing to death against the logs.  Stockard\r\nclove the man to the chin and fell to clearing space.  The ring of savage\r\nfaces closed in, raining upon him spear-thrusts and bone-barbed arrows.\r\nThe sun shot up, and they swayed back and forth in the crimson shadows.\r\nTwice, with his axe blocked by too deep a blow, they rushed him; but each\r\ntime he flung them clear.  They fell underfoot and he trampled dead and\r\ndying, the way slippery with blood.  And still the day brightened and the\r\nrobins sang.  Then they drew back from him in awe, and he leaned\r\nbreathless upon his axe.\r\n\r\n"Blood of my soul!" cried Baptiste the Red.  "But thou art a man.  Deny\r\nthy god, and thou shalt yet live."\r\n\r\nStockard swore his refusal, feebly but with grace.\r\n\r\n"Behold!  A woman!"  Sturges Owen had been brought before the half-breed.\r\n\r\nBeyond a scratch on the arm, he was uninjured, but his eyes roved about\r\nhim in an ecstasy of fear.  The heroic figure of the blasphemer,\r\nbristling with wounds and arrows, leaning defiantly upon his axe,\r\nindifferent, indomitable, superb, caught his wavering vision.  And he\r\nfelt a great envy of the man who could go down serenely to the dark gates\r\nof death.  Surely Christ, and not he, Sturges Owen, had been moulded in\r\nsuch manner.  And why not he?  He felt dimly the curse of ancestry, the\r\nfeebleness of spirit which had come down to him out of the past, and he\r\nfelt an anger at the creative force, symbolize it as he would, which had\r\nformed him, its servant, so weakly.  For even a stronger man, this anger\r\nand the stress of circumstance were sufficient to breed apostasy, and for\r\nSturges Owen it was inevitable.  In the fear of man\'s anger he would dare\r\nthe wrath of God.  He had been raised up to serve the Lord only that he\r\nmight be cast down.  He had been given faith without the strength of\r\nfaith; he had been given spirit without the power of spirit.  It was\r\nunjust.\r\n\r\n"Where now is thy god?" the half-breed demanded.\r\n\r\n"I do not know."  He stood straight and rigid, like a child repeating a\r\ncatechism.\r\n\r\n"Hast thou then a god at all?"\r\n\r\n"I had."\r\n\r\n"And now?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\nHay Stockard swept the blood from his eyes and laughed.  The missionary\r\nlooked at him curiously, as in a dream.  A feeling of infinite distance\r\ncame over him, as though of a great remove.  In that which had\r\ntranspired, and which was to transpire, he had no part.  He was a\r\nspectator--at a distance, yes, at a distance.  The words of Baptiste came\r\nto him faintly:-\r\n\r\n"Very good.  See that this man go free, and that no harm befall him.  Let\r\nhim depart in peace.  Give him a canoe and food.  Set his face toward the\r\nRussians, that he may tell their priests of Baptiste the Red, in whose\r\ncountry there is no god."\r\n\r\nThey led him to the edge of the steep, where they paused to witness the\r\nfinal tragedy.  The half-breed turned to Hay Stockard.\r\n\r\n"There is no god," he prompted.\r\n\r\nThe man laughed in reply.  One of the young men poised a war-spear for\r\nthe cast.\r\n\r\n"Hast thou a god?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, the God of my fathers."\r\n\r\nHe shifted the axe for a better grip.  Baptiste the Red gave the sign,\r\nand the spear hurtled full against his breast.  Sturges Owen saw the\r\nivory head stand out beyond his back, saw the man sway, laughing, and\r\nsnap the shaft short as he fell upon it.  Then he went down to the river,\r\nthat he might carry to the Russians the message of Baptiste the Red, in\r\nwhose country there was no god.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT INTERROGATION\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nTo say the least, Mrs. Sayther\'s career in Dawson was meteoric.  She\r\narrived in the spring, with dog sleds and French-Canadian _voyageurs_,\r\nblazed gloriously for a brief month, and departed up the river as soon as\r\nit was free of ice.  Now womanless Dawson never quite understood this\r\nhurried departure, and the local Four Hundred felt aggrieved and lonely\r\ntill the Nome strike was made and old sensations gave way to new.  For it\r\nhad delighted in Mrs. Sayther, and received her wide-armed.  She was\r\npretty, charming, and, moreover, a widow.  And because of this she at\r\nonce had at heel any number of Eldorado Kings, officials, and adventuring\r\nyounger sons, whose ears were yearning for the frou-frou of a woman\'s\r\nskirts.\r\n\r\nThe mining engineers revered the memory of her husband, the late Colonel\r\nSayther, while the syndicate and promoter representatives spoke awesomely\r\nof his deals and manipulations; for he was known down in the States as a\r\ngreat mining man, and as even a greater one in London.  Why his widow, of\r\nall women, should have come into the country, was the great\r\ninterrogation.  But they were a practical breed, the men of the\r\nNorthland, with a wholesome disregard for theories and a firm grip on\r\nfacts.  And to not a few of them Karen Sayther was a most essential fact.\r\nThat she did not regard the matter in this light, is evidenced by the\r\nneatness and celerity with which refusal and proposal tallied off during\r\nher four weeks\' stay.  And with her vanished the fact, and only the\r\ninterrogation remained.\r\n\r\nTo the solution, Chance vouchsafed one clew.  Her last victim, Jack\r\nCoughran, having fruitlessly laid at her feet both his heart and a five-\r\nhundred-foot creek claim on Bonanza, celebrated the misfortune by walking\r\nall of a night with the gods.  In the midwatch of this night he happened\r\nto rub shoulders with Pierre Fontaine, none other than head man of Karen\r\nSayther\'s _voyageurs_.  This rubbing of shoulders led to recognition and\r\ndrinks, and ultimately involved both men in a common muddle of inebriety.\r\n\r\n"Heh?" Pierre Fontaine later on gurgled thickly.  "Vot for Madame Sayther\r\nmak visitation to thees country?  More better you spik wit her.  I know\r\nno t\'ing \'tall, only all de tam her ask one man\'s name.  \'Pierre,\' her\r\nspik wit me; \'Pierre, you moos\' find thees mans, and I gif you mooch--one\r\nthousand dollar you find thees mans.\'  Thees mans?  Ah, _oui_.  Thees\r\nman\'s name--vot you call--Daveed Payne.  _Oui_, m\'sieu, Daveed Payne.  All\r\nde tam her spik das name.  And all de tam I look rount vaire mooch, work\r\nlak hell, but no can find das dam mans, and no get one thousand dollar\r\n\'tall.  By dam!\r\n\r\n"Heh?  Ah, _oui_.  One tam dose mens vot come from Circle City, dose mens\r\nknow thees mans.  Him Birch Creek, dey spik.  And madame?  Her say\r\n\'_Bon_!\' and look happy lak anyt\'ing.  And her spik wit me.  \'Pierre,\'\r\nher spik, \'harness de dogs.  We go queek.  We find thees mans I gif you\r\none thousand dollar more.\'  And I say, \'_Oui_, queek!  _Allons, madame_!\'\r\n\r\n"For sure, I t\'ink, das two thousand dollar mine.  Bully boy!  Den more\r\nmens come from Circle City, and dey say no, das thees mans, Daveed Payne,\r\ncome Dawson leel tam back.  So madame and I go not \'tall.\r\n\r\n"_Oui, m\'sieu_.  Thees day madame spik.  \'Pierre,\' her spik, and gif me\r\nfive hundred dollar, \'go buy poling-boat.  To-morrow we go up de river.\'\r\nAh, _oui_, to-morrow, up de river, and das dam Sitka Charley mak me pay\r\nfor de poling-boat five hundred dollar.  Dam!"\r\n\r\nThus it was, when Jack Coughran unburdened himself next day, that Dawson\r\nfell to wondering who was this David Payne, and in what way his existence\r\nbore upon Karen Sayther\'s.  But that very day, as Pierre Fontaine had\r\nsaid, Mrs. Sayther and her barbaric crew of _voyageurs_ towed up the east\r\nbank to Klondike City, shot across to the west bank to escape the bluffs,\r\nand disappeared amid the maze of islands to the south.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n"_Oui, madame_, thees is de place.  One, two, t\'ree island below Stuart\r\nRiver.  Thees is t\'ree island."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, Pierre Fontaine drove his pole against the bank and held the\r\nstern of the boat against the current.  This thrust the bow in, till a\r\nnimble breed climbed ashore with the painter and made fast.\r\n\r\n"One leel tam, madame, I go look see."\r\n\r\nA chorus of dogs marked his disappearance over the edge of the bank, but\r\na minute later he was back again.\r\n\r\n"_Oui, madame_, thees is de cabin.  I mak investigation.  No can find\r\nmans at home.  But him no go vaire far, vaire long, or him no leave dogs.\r\nHim come queek, you bet!"\r\n\r\n"Help me out, Pierre.  I\'m tired all over from the boat.  You might have\r\nmade it softer, you know."\r\n\r\nFrom a nest of furs amidships, Karen Sayther rose to her full height of\r\nslender fairness.  But if she looked lily-frail in her elemental\r\nenvironment, she was belied by the grip she put upon Pierre\'s hand, by\r\nthe knotting of her woman\'s biceps as it took the weight of her body, by\r\nthe splendid effort of her limbs as they held her out from the\r\nperpendicular bank while she made the ascent.  Though shapely flesh\r\nclothed delicate frame, her body was a seat of strength.\r\n\r\nStill, for all the careless ease with which she had made the landing,\r\nthere was a warmer color than usual to her face, and a perceptibly extra\r\nbeat to her heart.  But then, also, it was with a certain reverent\r\ncuriousness that she approached the cabin, while the Hush on her cheek\r\nshowed a yet riper mellowness.\r\n\r\n"Look, see!"  Pierre pointed to the scattered chips by the woodpile.  "Him\r\nfresh--two, t\'ree day, no more."\r\n\r\nMrs. Sayther nodded.  She tried to peer through the small window, but it\r\nwas made of greased parchment which admitted light while it blocked\r\nvision.  Failing this, she went round to the door, half lifted the rude\r\nlatch to enter, but changed her mind and let it fall back into place.\r\nThen she suddenly dropped on one knee and kissed the rough-hewn\r\nthreshold.  If Pierre Fontaine saw, he gave no sign, and the memory in\r\nthe time to come was never shared.  But the next instant, one of the\r\nboatmen, placidly lighting his pipe, was startled by an unwonted\r\nharshness in his captain\'s voice.\r\n\r\n"Hey!  You!  Le Goire! You mak\'m soft more better," Pierre commanded.\r\n"Plenty bearskin; plenty blanket.  Dam!"\r\n\r\nBut the nest was soon after disrupted, and the major portion tossed up to\r\nthe crest of the shore, where Mrs. Sayther lay down to wait in comfort.\r\n\r\nReclining on her side, she looked out and over the wide-stretching Yukon.\r\nAbove the mountains which lay beyond the further shore, the sky was murky\r\nwith the smoke of unseen forest fires, and through this the afternoon sun\r\nbroke feebly, throwing a vague radiance to earth, and unreal shadows.  To\r\nthe sky-line of the four quarters--spruce-shrouded islands, dark waters,\r\nand ice-scarred rocky ridges--stretched the immaculate wilderness.  No\r\nsign of human existence broke the solitude; no sound the stillness.  The\r\nland seemed bound under the unreality of the unknown, wrapped in the\r\nbrooding mystery of great spaces.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was this which made Mrs. Sayther nervous; for she changed her\r\nposition constantly, now to look up the river, now down, or to scan the\r\ngloomy shores for the half-hidden mouths of back channels.  After an hour\r\nor so the boatmen were sent ashore to pitch camp for the night, but\r\nPierre remained with his mistress to watch.\r\n\r\n"Ah! him come thees tam," he whispered, after a long silence, his gaze\r\nbent up the river to the head of the island.\r\n\r\nA canoe, with a paddle flashing on either side, was slipping down the\r\ncurrent.  In the stern a man\'s form, and in the bow a woman\'s, swung\r\nrhythmically to the work.  Mrs. Sayther had no eyes for the woman till\r\nthe canoe drove in closer and her bizarre beauty peremptorily demanded\r\nnotice.  A close-fitting blouse of moose-skin, fantastically beaded,\r\noutlined faithfully the well-rounded lines of her body, while a silken\r\nkerchief, gay of color and picturesquely draped, partly covered great\r\nmasses of blue-black hair.  But it was the face, cast belike in copper\r\nbronze, which caught and held Mrs. Sayther\'s fleeting glance.  Eyes,\r\npiercing and black and large, with a traditionary hint of obliqueness,\r\nlooked forth from under clear-stencilled, clean-arching brows.  Without\r\nsuggesting cadaverousness, though high-boned and prominent, the cheeks\r\nfell away and met in a mouth, thin-lipped and softly strong.  It was a\r\nface which advertised the dimmest trace of ancient Mongol blood, a\r\nreversion, after long centuries of wandering, to the parent stem.  This\r\neffect was heightened by the delicately aquiline nose with its thin\r\ntrembling nostrils, and by the general air of eagle wildness which seemed\r\nto characterize not only the face but the creature herself.  She was, in\r\nfact, the Tartar type modified to idealization, and the tribe of Red\r\nIndian is lucky that breeds such a unique body once in a score of\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nDipping long strokes and strong, the girl, in concert with the man,\r\nsuddenly whirled the tiny craft about against the current and brought it\r\ngently to the shore.  Another instant and she stood at the top of the\r\nbank, heaving up by rope, hand under hand, a quarter of fresh-killed\r\nmoose.  Then the man followed her, and together, with a swift rush, they\r\ndrew up the canoe.  The dogs were in a whining mass about them, and as\r\nthe girl stooped among them caressingly, the man\'s gaze fell upon Mrs.\r\nSayther, who had arisen.  He looked, brushed his eyes unconsciously as\r\nthough his sight were deceiving him, and looked again.\r\n\r\n"Karen," he said simply, coming forward and extending his hand, "I\r\nthought for the moment I was dreaming.  I went snow-blind for a time,\r\nthis spring, and since then my eyes have been playing tricks with me."\r\n\r\nMrs. Sayther, whose flush had deepened and whose heart was urging\r\npainfully, had been prepared for almost anything save this coolly\r\nextended hand; but she tactfully curbed herself and grasped it heartily\r\nwith her own.\r\n\r\n"You know, Dave, I threatened often to come, and I would have, too,\r\nonly--only--"\r\n\r\n"Only I didn\'t give the word."  David Payne laughed and watched the\r\nIndian girl disappearing into the cabin.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I understand, Dave, and had I been in your place I\'d most probably\r\nhave done the same.  But I have come--now."\r\n\r\n"Then come a little bit farther, into the cabin and get something to\r\neat," he said genially, ignoring or missing the feminine suggestion of\r\nappeal in her voice.  "And you must be tired too.  Which way are you\r\ntravelling?  Up?  Then you wintered in Dawson, or came in on the last\r\nice.  Your camp?"  He glanced at the _voyageurs_ circled about the fire\r\nin the open, and held back the door for her to enter.\r\n\r\n"I came up on the ice from Circle City last winter," he continued, "and\r\nsettled down here for a while.  Am prospecting some on Henderson Creek,\r\nand if that fails, have been thinking of trying my hand this fall up the\r\nStuart River."\r\n\r\n"You aren\'t changed much, are you?" she asked irrelevantly, striving to\r\nthrow the conversation upon a more personal basis.\r\n\r\n"A little less flesh, perhaps, and a little more muscle.  How did _you_\r\nmean?"\r\n\r\nBut she shrugged her shoulders and peered I through the dim light at the\r\nIndian girl, who had lighted the fire and was frying great chunks of\r\nmoose meat, alternated with thin ribbons of bacon.\r\n\r\n"Did you stop in Dawson long?"  The man was whittling a stave of\r\nbirchwood into a rude axe-handle, and asked the question without raising\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n"Oh, a few days," she answered, following the girl with her eyes, and\r\nhardly hearing.  "What were you saying?  In Dawson?  A month, in fact,\r\nand glad to get away.  The arctic male is elemental, you know, and\r\nsomewhat strenuous in his feelings."\r\n\r\n"Bound to be when he gets right down to the soil.  He leaves convention\r\nwith the spring bed at borne.  But you were wise in your choice of time\r\nfor leaving.  You\'ll be out of the country before mosquito season, which\r\nis a blessing your lack of experience will not permit you to appreciate."\r\n\r\n"I suppose not.  But tell me about yourself, about your life.  What kind\r\nof neighbors have you?  Or have you any?"\r\n\r\nWhile she queried she watched the girl grinding coffee in the corner of a\r\nflower sack upon the hearthstone.  With a steadiness and skill which\r\npredicated nerves as primitive as the method, she crushed the imprisoned\r\nberries with a heavy fragment of quartz.  David Payne noted his visitor\'s\r\ngaze, and the shadow of a smile drifted over his lips.\r\n\r\n"I did have some," he replied.  "Missourian chaps, and a couple of\r\nCornishmen, but they went down to Eldorado to work at wages for a\r\ngrubstake."\r\n\r\nMrs. Sayther cast a look of speculative regard upon the girl.  "But of\r\ncourse there are plenty of Indians about?"\r\n\r\n"Every mother\'s son of them down to Dawson long ago.  Not a native in the\r\nwhole country, barring Winapie here, and she\'s a Koyokuk lass,--comes\r\nfrom a thousand miles or so down the river."\r\n\r\nMrs. Sayther felt suddenly faint; and though the smile of interest in no\r\nwise waned, the face of the man seemed to draw away to a telescopic\r\ndistance, and the tiered logs of the cabin to whirl drunkenly about.  But\r\nshe was bidden draw up to the table, and during the meal discovered time\r\nand space in which to find herself.  She talked little, and that\r\nprincipally about the land and weather, while the man wandered off into a\r\nlong description of the difference between the shallow summer diggings of\r\nthe Lower Country and the deep winter diggings of the Upper Country.\r\n\r\n"You do not ask why I came north?" she asked.  "Surely you know."  They\r\nhad moved back from the table, and David Payne had returned to his axe-\r\nhandle.  "Did you get my letter?"\r\n\r\n"A last one?  No, I don\'t think so.  Most probably it\'s trailing around\r\nthe Birch Creek Country or lying in some trader\'s shack on the Lower\r\nRiver.  The way they run the mails in here is shameful.  No order, no\r\nsystem, no--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be wooden, Dave!  Help me!"  She spoke sharply now, with an\r\nassumption of authority which rested upon the past.  "Why don\'t you ask\r\nme about myself?  About those we knew in the old times?  Have you no\r\nlonger any interest in the world?  Do you know that my husband is dead?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I am sorry.  How long--"\r\n\r\n"David!"  She was ready to cry with vexation, but the reproach she threw\r\ninto her voice eased her.\r\n\r\n"Did you get any of my letters?  You must have got some of them, though\r\nyou never answered."\r\n\r\n"Well, I didn\'t get the last one, announcing, evidently, the death of\r\nyour husband, and most likely others went astray; but I did get some.\r\nI--er--read them aloud to Winapie as a warning--that is, you know, to\r\nimpress upon her the wickedness of her white sisters.  And I--er--think\r\nshe profited by it.  Don\'t you?"\r\n\r\nShe disregarded the sting, and went on.  "In the last letter, which you\r\ndid not receive, I told, as you have guessed, of Colonel Sayther\'s death.\r\nThat was a year ago.  I also said that if you did not come out to me, I\r\nwould go in to you.  And as I had often promised, I came."\r\n\r\n"I know of no promise."\r\n\r\n"In the earlier letters?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you promised, but as I neither asked nor answered, it was\r\nunratified.  So I do not know of any such promise.  But I do know of\r\nanother, which you, too, may remember.  It was very long ago."  He\r\ndropped the axe-handle to the floor and raised his head.  "It was so very\r\nlong ago, yet I remember it distinctly, the day, the time, every detail.\r\nWe were in a rose garden, you and I,--your mother\'s rose garden.  All\r\nthings were budding, blossoming, and the sap of spring was in our blood.\r\nAnd I drew you over--it was the first--and kissed you full on the lips.\r\nDon\'t you remember?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t go over it, Dave, don\'t!  I know every shameful line of it.  How\r\noften have I wept!  If you only knew how I have suffered--"\r\n\r\n"You promised me then--ay, and a thousand times in the sweet days that\r\nfollowed.  Each look of your eyes, each touch of your hand, each syllable\r\nthat fell from your lips, was a promise.  And then--how shall I\r\nsay?--there came a man.  He was old--old enough to have begotten you--and\r\nnot nice to look upon, but as the world goes, clean.  He had done no\r\nwrong, followed the letter of the law, was respectable.  Further, and to\r\nthe point, he possessed some several paltry mines,--a score; it does not\r\nmatter: and he owned a few miles of lands, and engineered deals, and\r\nclipped coupons.  He--"\r\n\r\n"But there were other things," she interrupted, "I told you.\r\nPressure--money matters--want--my people--trouble.  You understood the\r\nwhole sordid situation.  I could not help it.  It was not my will.  I was\r\nsacrificed, or I sacrificed, have it as you wish.  But, my God!  Dave, I\r\ngave you up!  You never did _me_ justice.  Think what I have gone\r\nthrough!"\r\n\r\n"It was not your will?  Pressure?  Under high heaven there was no thing\r\nto will you to this man\'s bed or that."\r\n\r\n"But I cared for you all the time," she pleaded.\r\n\r\n"I was unused to your way of measuring love.  I am still unused.  I do\r\nnot understand."\r\n\r\n"But now! now!"\r\n\r\n"We were speaking of this man you saw fit to marry.  What manner of man\r\nwas he?  Wherein did he charm your soul?  What potent virtues were his?\r\nTrue, he had a golden grip,--an almighty golden grip.  He knew the odds.\r\nHe was versed in cent per cent.  He had a narrow wit and excellent\r\njudgment of the viler parts, whereby he transferred this man\'s money to\r\nhis pockets, and that man\'s money, and the next man\'s.  And the law\r\nsmiled.  In that it did not condemn, our Christian ethics approved.  By\r\nsocial measure he was not a bad man.  But by your measure, Karen, by\r\nmine, by ours of the rose garden, what was he?"\r\n\r\n"Remember, he is dead."\r\n\r\n"The fact is not altered thereby.  What was he?  A great, gross, material\r\ncreature, deaf to song, blind to beauty, dead to the spirit.  He was fat\r\nwith laziness, and flabby-cheeked, and the round of his belly witnessed\r\nhis gluttony--"\r\n\r\n"But he is dead.  It is we who are now--now! now!  Don\'t you hear?  As\r\nyou say, I have been inconstant.  I have sinned.  Good.  But should not\r\nyou, too, cry _peccavi_?  If I have broken promises, have not you?  Your\r\nlove of the rose garden was of all time, or so you said.  Where is it\r\nnow?"\r\n\r\n"It is here! now!" he cried, striking his breast passionately with\r\nclenched hand.  "It has always been."\r\n\r\n"And your love was a great love; there was none greater," she continued;\r\n"or so you said in the rose garden.  Yet it is not fine enough, large\r\nenough, to forgive me here, crying now at your feet?"\r\n\r\nThe man hesitated.  His mouth opened; words shaped vainly on his lips.\r\nShe had forced him to bare his heart and speak truths which he had hidden\r\nfrom himself.  And she was good to look upon, standing there in a glory\r\nof passion, calling back old associations and warmer life.  He turned\r\naway his head that he might not see, but she passed around and fronted\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Look at me, Dave!  Look at me!  I am the same, after all.  And so are\r\nyou, if you would but see.  We are not changed."\r\n\r\nHer hand rested on his shoulder, and his had half-passed, roughly, about\r\nher, when the sharp crackle of a match startled him to himself.  Winapie,\r\nalien to the scene, was lighting the slow wick of the slush lamp.  She\r\nappeared to start out against a background of utter black, and the flame,\r\nflaring suddenly up, lighted her bronze beauty to royal gold.\r\n\r\n"You see, it is impossible," he groaned, thrusting the fair-haired woman\r\ngently from him.  "It is impossible," he repeated.  "It is impossible."\r\n\r\n"I am not a girl, Dave, with a girl\'s illusions," she said softly, though\r\nnot daring to come back to him.  "It is as a woman that I understand.  Men\r\nare men.  A common custom of the country.  I am not shocked.  I divined\r\nit from the first.  But--ah!--it is only a marriage of the country--not a\r\nreal marriage?"\r\n\r\n"We do not ask such questions in Alaska," he interposed feebly.\r\n\r\n"I know, but--"\r\n\r\n"Well, then, it is only a marriage of the country--nothing else."\r\n\r\n"And there are no children?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Nor--"\r\n\r\n"No, no; nothing--but it is impossible."\r\n\r\n"But it is not."  She was at his side again, her hand touching lightly,\r\ncaressingly, the sunburned back of his.  "I know the custom of the land\r\ntoo well.  Men do it every day.  They do not care to remain here, shut\r\nout from the world, for all their days; so they give an order on the P.\r\nC. C. Company for a year\'s provisions, some money in hand, and the girl\r\nis content.  By the end of that time, a man--"  She shrugged her\r\nshoulders.  "And so with the girl here.  We will give her an order upon\r\nthe company, not for a year, but for life.  What was she when you found\r\nher?  A raw, meat-eating savage; fish in summer, moose in winter,\r\nfeasting in plenty, starving in famine.  But for you that is what she\r\nwould have remained.  For your coming she was happier; for your going,\r\nsurely, with a life of comparative splendor assured, she will be happier\r\nthan if you had never been."\r\n\r\n"No, no," he protested.  "It is not right."\r\n\r\n"Come, Dave, you must see.  She is not your kind.  There is no race\r\naffinity.  She is an aborigine, sprung from the soil, yet close to the\r\nsoil, and impossible to lift from the soil.  Born savage, savage she will\r\ndie.  But we--you and I--the dominant, evolved race--the salt of the\r\nearth and the masters thereof!  We are made for each other.  The supreme\r\ncall is of kind, and we are of kind.  Reason and feeling dictate it.  Your\r\nvery instinct demands it.  That you cannot deny.  You cannot escape the\r\ngenerations behind you.  Yours is an ancestry which has survived for a\r\nthousand centuries, and for a hundred thousand centuries, and your line\r\nmust not stop here.  It cannot.  Your ancestry will not permit it.\r\nInstinct is stronger than the will.  The race is mightier than you.  Come,\r\nDave, let us go.  We are young yet, and life is good.  Come."\r\n\r\nWinapie, passing out of the cabin to feed the dogs, caught his attention\r\nand caused him to shake his head and weakly to reiterate.  But the\r\nwoman\'s hand slipped about his neck, and her cheek pressed to his.  His\r\nbleak life rose up and smote him,--the vain struggle with pitiless\r\nforces; the dreary years of frost and famine; the harsh and jarring\r\ncontact with elemental life; the aching void which mere animal existence\r\ncould not fill.  And there, seduction by his side, whispering of\r\nbrighter, warmer lands, of music, light, and joy, called the old times\r\nback again.  He visioned it unconsciously.  Faces rushed in upon him;\r\nglimpses of forgotten scenes, memories of merry hours; strains of song\r\nand trills of laughter--\r\n\r\n"Come, Dave, Come.  I have for both.  The way is soft."  She looked about\r\nher at the bare furnishings of the cabin.  "I have for both.  The world\r\nis at our feet, and all joy is ours.  Come! come!"\r\n\r\nShe was in his arms, trembling, and he held her tightly.  He rose to his\r\nfeet . . . But the snarling of hungry dogs, and the shrill cries of\r\nWinapie bringing about peace between the combatants, came muffled to his\r\near through the heavy logs.  And another scene flashed before him.  A\r\nstruggle in the forest,--a bald-face grizzly, broken-legged, terrible;\r\nthe snarling of the dogs and the shrill cries of Winapie as she urged\r\nthem to the attack; himself in the midst of the crush, breathless,\r\npanting, striving to hold off red death; broken-backed, entrail-ripped\r\ndogs howling in impotent anguish and desecrating the snow; the virgin\r\nwhite running scarlet with the blood of man and beast; the bear,\r\nferocious, irresistible, crunching, crunching down to the core of his\r\nlife; and Winapie, at the last, in the thick of the frightful muddle,\r\nhair flying, eyes flashing, fury incarnate, passing the long hunting\r\nknife again and again--Sweat started to his forehead.  He shook off the\r\nclinging woman and staggered back to the wall.  And she, knowing that the\r\nmoment had come, but unable to divine what was passing within him, felt\r\nall she had gained slipping away.\r\n\r\n"Dave!  Dave!" she cried.  "I will not give you up!  I will not give you\r\nup!  If you do not wish to come, we will stay.  I will stay with you.  The\r\nworld is less to me than are you.  I will be a Northland wife to you.  I\r\nwill cook your food, feed your dogs, break trail for you, lift a paddle\r\nwith you.  I can do it.  Believe me, I am strong."\r\n\r\nNor did he doubt it, looking upon her and holding her off from him; but\r\nhis face had grown stern and gray, and the warmth had died out of his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"I will pay off Pierre and the boatmen, and let them go.  And I will stay\r\nwith you, priest or no priest, minister or no minister; go with you, now,\r\nanywhere!  Dave!  Dave!  Listen to me!  You say I did you wrong in the\r\npast--and I did--let me make up for it, let me atone.  If I did not\r\nrightly measure love before, let me show that I can now."\r\n\r\nShe sank to the floor and threw her arms about his knees, sobbing.  "And\r\nyou _do_ care for me.  You _do_ care for me.  Think!  The long years I\r\nhave waited, suffered!  You can never know!"  He stooped and raised her\r\nto her feet.\r\n\r\n"Listen," he commanded, opening the door and lifting her bodily outside.\r\n"It cannot be.  We are not alone to be considered.  You must go.  I wish\r\nyou a safe journey.  You will find it tougher work when you get up by the\r\nSixty Mile, but you have the best boatmen in the world, and will get\r\nthrough all right.  Will you say good-by?"\r\n\r\nThough she already had herself in hand, she looked at him hopelessly.\r\n"If--if--if Winapie should--"  She quavered and stopped.\r\n\r\nBut he grasped the unspoken thought, and answered, "Yes."  Then struck\r\nwith the enormity of it, "It cannot be conceived.  There is no\r\nlikelihood.  It must not be entertained."\r\n\r\n"Kiss me," she whispered, her face lighting.  Then she turned and went\r\naway.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n"Break camp, Pierre," she said to the boatman, who alone had remained\r\nawake against her return.  "We must be going."\r\n\r\nBy the firelight his sharp eyes scanned the woe in her face, but he\r\nreceived the extraordinary command as though it were the most usual thing\r\nin the world.  "_Oui, madame_," he assented.  "Which way?  Dawson?"\r\n\r\n"No," she answered, lightly enough; "up; out; Dyea."\r\n\r\nWhereat he fell upon the sleeping _voyageurs_, kicking them, grunting,\r\nfrom their blankets, and buckling them down to the work, the while his\r\nvoice, vibrant with action, shrilling through all the camp.  In a trice\r\nMrs. Sayther\'s tiny tent had been struck, pots and pans were being\r\ngathered up, blankets rolled, and the men staggering under the loads to\r\nthe boat.  Here, on the banks, Mrs. Sayther waited till the luggage was\r\nmade ship-shape and her nest prepared.\r\n\r\n"We line up to de head of de island," Pierre explained to her while\r\nrunning out the long tow rope.  "Den we tak to das back channel, where de\r\nwater not queek, and I t\'ink we mak good tam."\r\n\r\nA scuffling and pattering of feet in the last year\'s dry grass caught his\r\nquick ear, and he turned his head.  The Indian girl, circled by a\r\nbristling ring of wolf dogs, was coming toward them.  Mrs. Sayther noted\r\nthat the girl\'s face, which had been apathetic throughout the scene in\r\nthe cabin, had now quickened into blazing and wrathful life.\r\n\r\n"What you do my man?" she demanded abruptly of Mrs. Sayther.  "Him lay on\r\nbunk, and him look bad all the time.  I say, \'What the matter, Dave?  You\r\nsick?\'  But him no say nothing.  After that him say, \'Good girl Winapie,\r\ngo way.  I be all right bimeby.\'  What you do my man, eh?  I think you\r\nbad woman."\r\n\r\nMrs. Sayther looked curiously at the barbarian woman who shared the life\r\nof this man, while she departed alone in the darkness of night.\r\n\r\n"I think you bad woman," Winapie repeated in the slow, methodical way of\r\none who gropes for strange words in an alien tongue.  "I think better you\r\ngo way, no come no more.  Eh?  What you think?  I have one man.  I Indian\r\ngirl.  You \'Merican woman.  You good to see.  You find plenty men.  Your\r\neyes blue like the sky.  Your skin so white, so soft."\r\n\r\nCoolly she thrust out a brown forefinger and pressed the soft cheek of\r\nthe other woman.  And to the eternal credit of Karen Sayther, she never\r\nflinched.  Pierre hesitated and half stepped forward; but she motioned\r\nhim away, though her heart welled to him with secret gratitude.  "It\'s\r\nall right, Pierre," she said.  "Please go away."\r\n\r\nHe stepped back respectfully out of earshot, where he stood grumbling to\r\nhimself and measuring the distance in springs.\r\n\r\n"Um white, um soft, like baby."  Winapie touched the other cheek and\r\nwithdrew her hand.  "Bimeby mosquito come.  Skin get sore in spot; um\r\nswell, oh, so big; um hurt, oh, so much.  Plenty mosquito; plenty spot.  I\r\nthink better you go now before mosquito come.  This way," pointing down\r\nthe stream, "you go St. Michael\'s; that way," pointing up, "you go Dyea.\r\nBetter you go Dyea.  Good-by."\r\n\r\nAnd that which Mrs. Sayther then did, caused Pierre to marvel greatly.\r\nFor she threw her arms around the Indian girl, kissed her, and burst into\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n"Be good to him," she cried.  "Be good to him."\r\n\r\nThen she slipped half down the face of the bank, called back "Good-by,"\r\nand dropped into the boat amidships.  Pierre followed her and cast off.\r\nHe shoved the steering oar into place and gave the signal.  Le Goire\r\nlifted an old French _chanson_; the men, like a row of ghosts in the dim\r\nstarlight, bent their backs to the tow line; the steering oar cut the\r\nblack current sharply, and the boat swept out into the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHICH MAKE MEN REMEMBER\r\n\r\n\r\nFortune La Pearle crushed his way through the snow, sobbing, straining,\r\ncursing his luck, Alaska, Nome, the cards, and the man who had felt his\r\nknife.  The hot blood was freezing on his hands, and the scene yet bright\r\nin his eyes,--the man, clutching the table and sinking slowly to the\r\nfloor; the rolling counters and the scattered deck; the swift shiver\r\nthroughout the room, and the pause; the game-keepers no longer calling,\r\nand the clatter of the chips dying away; the startled faces; the infinite\r\ninstant of silence; and then the great blood-roar and the tide of\r\nvengeance which lapped his heels and turned the town mad behind him.\r\n\r\n"All hell\'s broke loose," he sneered, turning aside in the darkness and\r\nheading for the beach.  Lights were flashing from open doors, and tent,\r\ncabin, and dance-hall let slip their denizens upon the chase.  The clamor\r\nof men and howling of dogs smote his ears and quickened his feet.  He ran\r\non and on.  The sounds grew dim, and the pursuit dissipated itself in\r\nvain rage and aimless groping.  But a flitting shadow clung to him.  Head\r\nthrust over shoulder, he caught glimpses of it, now taking vague shape on\r\nan open expanse of snow, how merging into the deeper shadows of some\r\ndarkened cabin or beach-listed craft.\r\n\r\nFortune La Pearle swore like a woman, weakly, with the hint of tears that\r\ncomes of exhaustion, and plunged deeper into the maze of heaped ice,\r\ntents, and prospect holes.  He stumbled over taut hawsers and piles of\r\ndunnage, tripped on crazy guy-ropes and insanely planted pegs, and fell\r\nagain and again upon frozen dumps and mounds of hoarded driftwood.  At\r\ntimes, when he deemed he had drawn clear, his head dizzy with the painful\r\npounding of his heart and the suffocating intake of his breath, he\r\nslackened down; and ever the shadow leaped out of the gloom and forced\r\nhim on in heart-breaking flight.  A swift intuition lashed upon him,\r\nleaving in its trail the cold chill of superstition.  The persistence of\r\nthe shadow he invested with his gambler\'s symbolism.  Silent, inexorable,\r\nnot to be shaken off, he took it as the fate which waited at the last\r\nturn when chips were cashed in and gains and losses counted up.  Fortune\r\nLa Pearle believed in those rare, illuminating moments, when the\r\nintelligence flung from it time and space, to rise naked through eternity\r\nand read the facts of life from the open book of chance.  That this was\r\nsuch a moment he had no doubt; and when he turned inland and sped across\r\nthe snow-covered tundra he was not startled because the shadow took upon\r\nit greater definiteness and drew in closer.  Oppressed with his own\r\nimpotence, he halted in the midst of the white waste and whirled about.\r\nHis right hand slipped from its mitten, and a revolver, at level,\r\nglistened in the pale light of the stars.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t shoot.  I haven\'t a gun."\r\n\r\nThe shadow had assumed tangible shape, and at the sound of its human\r\nvoice a trepidation affected Fortune La Pearle\'s knees, and his stomach\r\nwas stricken with the qualms of sudden relief.\r\n\r\nPerhaps things fell out differently because Uri Bram had no gun that\r\nnight when he sat on the hard benches of the El Dorado and saw murder\r\ndone.  To that fact also might be attributed the trip on the Long Trail\r\nwhich he took subsequently with a most unlikely comrade.  But be it as it\r\nmay, he repeated a second time, "Don\'t shoot.  Can\'t you see I haven\'t a\r\ngun?"\r\n\r\n"Then what the flaming hell did you take after me for?" demanded the\r\ngambler, lowering his revolver.\r\n\r\nUri Bram shrugged his shoulders.  "It don\'t matter much, anyhow.  I want\r\nyou to come with me."\r\n\r\n"Where?"\r\n\r\n"To my shack, over on the edge of the camp."\r\n\r\nBut Fortune La Pearle drove the heel of his moccasin into the snow and\r\nattested by his various deities to the madness of Uri Bram.  "Who are\r\nyou," he perorated, "and what am I, that I should put my neck into the\r\nrope at your bidding?"\r\n\r\n"I am Uri Bram," the other said simply, "and my shack is over there on\r\nthe edge of camp.  I don\'t know who you are, but you\'ve thrust the soul\r\nfrom a living man\'s body,--there\'s the blood red on your sleeve,--and,\r\nlike a second Cain, the hand of all mankind is against you, and there is\r\nno place you may lay your head.  Now, I have a shack--"\r\n\r\n"For the love of your mother, hold your say, man," interrupted Fortune La\r\nPearle, "or I\'ll make you a second Abel for the joy of it.  So help me, I\r\nwill!  With a thousand men to lay me by the heels, looking high and low,\r\nwhat do I want with your shack?  I want to get out of here--away! away!\r\naway!  Cursed swine!  I\'ve half a mind to go back and run amuck, and\r\nsettle for a few of them, the pigs!  One gorgeous, glorious fight, and\r\nend the whole damn business!  It\'s a skin game, that\'s what life is, and\r\nI\'m sick of it!"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, appalled, crushed by his great desolation, and Uri Bram\r\nseized the moment.  He was not given to speech, this man, and that which\r\nfollowed was the longest in his life, save one long afterward in another\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n"That\'s why I told you about my shack.  I can stow you there so they\'ll\r\nnever find you, and I\'ve got grub in plenty.  Elsewise you can\'t get\r\naway.  No dogs, no nothing, the sea closed, St. Michael the nearest post,\r\nrunners to carry the news before you, the same over the portage to\r\nAnvik--not a chance in the world for you!  Now wait with me till it blows\r\nover.  They\'ll forget all about you in a month or less, what of\r\nstampeding to York and what not, and you can hit the trail under their\r\nnoses and they won\'t bother.  I\'ve got my own ideas of justice.  When I\r\nran after you, out of the El Dorado and along the beach, it wasn\'t to\r\ncatch you or give you up.  My ideas are my own, and that\'s not one of\r\nthem."\r\n\r\nHe ceased as the murderer drew a prayer-book from his pocket.  With the\r\naurora borealis glimmering yellow in the northeast, heads bared to the\r\nfrost and naked hands grasping the sacred book, Fortune La Pearle swore\r\nhim to the words he had spoken--an oath which Uri Bram never intended\r\nbreaking, and never broke.\r\n\r\nAt the door of the shack the gambler hesitated for an instant, marvelling\r\nat the strangeness of this man who had befriended him, and doubting.  But\r\nby the candlelight he found the cabin comfortable and without occupants,\r\nand he was quickly rolling a cigarette while the other man made coffee.\r\nHis muscles relaxed in the warmth and he lay back with half-assumed\r\nindolence, intently studying Uri\'s face through the curling wisps of\r\nsmoke.  It was a powerful face, but its strength was of that peculiar\r\nsort which stands girt in and unrelated.  The seams were deep-graven,\r\nmore like scars, while the stern features were in no way softened by\r\nhints of sympathy or humor.  Under prominent bushy brows the eyes shone\r\ncold and gray.  The cheekbones, high and forbidding, were undermined by\r\ndeep hollows.  The chin and jaw displayed a steadiness of purpose which\r\nthe narrow forehead advertised as single, and, if needs be, pitiless.\r\nEverything was harsh, the nose, the lips, the voice, the lines about the\r\nmouth.  It was the face of one who communed much with himself, unused to\r\nseeking counsel from the world; the face of one who wrestled oft of\r\nnights with angels, and rose to face the day with shut lips that no man\r\nmight know.  He was narrow but deep; and Fortune, his own humanity broad\r\nand shallow, could make nothing of him.  Did Uri sing when merry and sigh\r\nwhen sad, he could have understood; but as it was, the cryptic features\r\nwere undecipherable; he could not measure the soul they concealed.\r\n\r\n"Lend a hand, Mister Man," Uri ordered when the cups had been emptied.\r\n"We\'ve got to fix up for visitors."\r\n\r\nFortune purred his name for the other\'s benefit, and assisted\r\nunderstandingly.  The bunk was built against a side and end of the cabin.\r\nIt was a rude affair, the bottom being composed of drift-wood logs\r\noverlaid with moss.  At the foot the rough ends of these timbers\r\nprojected in an uneven row.  From the side next the wall Uri ripped back\r\nthe moss and removed three of the logs.  The jagged ends he sawed off and\r\nreplaced so that the projecting row remained unbroken.  Fortune carried\r\nin sacks of flour from the cache and piled them on the floor beneath the\r\naperture.  On these Uri laid a pair of long sea-bags, and over all spread\r\nseveral thicknesses of moss and blankets.  Upon this Fortune could lie,\r\nwith the sleeping furs stretching over him from one side of the bunk to\r\nthe other, and all men could look upon it and declare it empty.\r\n\r\nIn the weeks which followed, several domiciliary visits were paid, not a\r\nshack or tent in Nome escaping, but Fortune lay in his cranny\r\nundisturbed.  In fact, little attention was given to Uri Bram\'s cabin;\r\nfor it was the last place under the sun to expect to find the murderer of\r\nJohn Randolph.  Except during such interruptions, Fortune lolled about\r\nthe cabin, playing long games of solitaire and smoking endless\r\ncigarettes.  Though his volatile nature loved geniality and play of words\r\nand laughter, he quickly accommodated himself to Uri\'s taciturnity.\r\nBeyond the actions and plans of his pursuers, the state of the trails,\r\nand the price of dogs, they never talked; and these things were only\r\ndiscussed at rare intervals and briefly.  But Fortune fell to working out\r\na system, and hour after hour, and day after day, he shuffled and dealt,\r\nshuffled and dealt, noted the combinations of the cards in long columns,\r\nand shuffled and dealt again.  Toward the end even this absorption failed\r\nhim, and, head bowed upon the table, he visioned the lively all-night\r\nhouses of Nome, where the gamekeepers and lookouts worked in shifts and\r\nthe clattering roulette ball never slept.  At such times his loneliness\r\nand bankruptcy stunned him till he sat for hours in the same unblinking,\r\nunchanging position.  At other times, his long-pent bitterness found\r\nvoice in passionate outbursts; for he had rubbed the world the wrong way\r\nand did not like the feel of it.\r\n\r\n"Life\'s a skin-game," he was fond of repeating, and on this one note he\r\nrang the changes.  "I never had half a chance," he complained.  "I was\r\nfaked in my birth and flim-flammed with my mother\'s milk.  The dice were\r\nloaded when she tossed the box, and I was born to prove the loss.  But\r\nthat was no reason she should blame me for it, and look on me as a cold\r\ndeck; but she did--ay, she did.  Why didn\'t she give me a show?  Why\r\ndidn\'t the world?  Why did I go broke in Seattle?  Why did I take the\r\nsteerage, and live like a hog to Nome?  Why did I go to the El Dorado?  I\r\nwas heading for Big Pete\'s and only went for matches.  Why didn\'t I have\r\nmatches?  Why did I want to smoke?  Don\'t you see?  All worked out, every\r\nbit of it, all parts fitting snug.  Before I was born, like as not.  I\'ll\r\nput the sack I never hope to get on it, before I was born.  That\'s why!\r\nThat\'s why John Randolph passed the word and his checks in at the same\r\ntime.  Damn him!  It served him well right!  Why didn\'t he keep his\r\ntongue between his teeth and give me a chance?  He knew I was next to\r\nbroke.  Why didn\'t I hold my hand?  Oh, why?  Why?  Why?"\r\n\r\nAnd Fortune La Pearle would roll upon the floor, vainly interrogating the\r\nscheme of things.  At such outbreaks Uri said no word, gave no sign, save\r\nthat his grey eyes seemed to turn dull and muddy, as though from lack of\r\ninterest.  There was nothing in common between these two men, and this\r\nfact Fortune grasped sufficiently to wonder sometimes why Uri had stood\r\nby him.\r\n\r\nBut the time of waiting came to an end.  Even a community\'s blood lust\r\ncannot stand before its gold lust.  The murder of John Randolph had\r\nalready passed into the annals of the camp, and there it rested.  Had the\r\nmurderer appeared, the men of Nome would certainly have stopped\r\nstampeding long enough to see justice done, whereas the whereabouts of\r\nFortune La Pearle was no longer an insistent problem.  There was gold in\r\nthe creek beds and ruby beaches, and when the sea opened, the men with\r\nhealthy sacks would sail away to where the good things of life were sold\r\nabsurdly cheap.\r\n\r\nSo, one night, Fortune helped Uri Bram harness the dogs and lash the\r\nsled, and the twain took the winter trail south on the ice.  But it was\r\nnot all south; for they left the sea east from St. Michael\'s, crossed the\r\ndivide, and struck the Yukon at Anvik, many hundred miles from its mouth.\r\nThen on, into the northeast, past Koyokuk, Tanana, and Minook, till they\r\nrounded the Great Curve at Fort Yukon, crossed and recrossed the Arctic\r\nCircle, and headed south through the Flats.  It was a weary journey, and\r\nFortune would have wondered why the man went with him, had not Uri told\r\nhim that he owned claims and had men working at Eagle.  Eagle lay on the\r\nedge of the line; a few miles farther on, the British flag waved over the\r\nbarracks at Fort Cudahy.  Then came Dawson, Pelly, the Five Fingers,\r\nWindy Arm, Caribou Crossing, Linderman, the Chilcoot and Dyea.\r\n\r\nOn the morning after passing Eagle, they rose early.  This was their last\r\ncamp, and they were now to part.  Fortune\'s heart was light.  There was a\r\npromise of spring in the land, and the days were growing longer.  The way\r\nwas passing into Canadian territory.  Liberty was at hand, the sun was\r\nreturning, and each day saw him nearer to the Great Outside.  The world\r\nwas big, and he could once again paint his future in royal red.  He\r\nwhistled about the breakfast and hummed snatches of light song while Uri\r\nput the dogs in harness and packed up.  But when all was ready, Fortune\'s\r\nfeet itching to be off, Uri pulled an unused back-log to the fire and sat\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n"Ever hear of the Dead Horse Trail?"\r\n\r\nHe glanced up meditatively and Fortune shook his head, inwardly chafing\r\nat the delay.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes there are meetings under circumstances which make men\r\nremember," Uri continued, speaking in a low voice and very slowly, "and I\r\nmet a man under such circumstances on the Dead Horse Trail.  Freighting\r\nan outfit over the White Pass in \'97 broke many a man\'s heart, for there\r\nwas a world of reason when they gave that trail its name.  The horses\r\ndied like mosquitoes in the first frost, and from Skaguay to Bennett they\r\nrotted in heaps.  They died at the Rocks, they were poisoned at the\r\nSummit, and they starved at the Lakes; they fell off the trail, what\r\nthere was of it, or they went through it; in the river they drowned under\r\ntheir loads, or were smashed to pieces against the boulders; they snapped\r\ntheir legs in the crevices and broke their backs falling backwards with\r\ntheir packs; in the sloughs they sank from sight or smothered in the\r\nslime, and they were disembowelled in the bogs where the corduroy logs\r\nturned end up in the mud; men shot them, worked them to death, and when\r\nthey were gone, went back to the beach and bought more.  Some did not\r\nbother to shoot them,--stripping the saddles off and the shoes and\r\nleaving them where they fell.  Their hearts turned to stone--those which\r\ndid not break--and they became beasts, the men on Dead Horse Trail.\r\n\r\n"It was there I met a man with the heart of a Christ and the patience.\r\nAnd he was honest.  When he rested at midday he took the packs from the\r\nhorses so that they, too, might rest.  He paid $50 a hundred-weight for\r\ntheir fodder, and more.  He used his own bed to blanket their backs when\r\nthey rubbed raw.  Other men let the saddles eat holes the size of water-\r\nbuckets.  Other men, when the shoes gave out, let them wear their hoofs\r\ndown to the bleeding stumps.  He spent his last dollar for horseshoe\r\nnails.  I know this because we slept in the one bed and ate from the one\r\npot, and became blood brothers where men lost their grip of things and\r\ndied blaspheming God.  He was never too tired to ease a strap or tighten\r\na cinch, and often there were tears in his eyes when he looked on all\r\nthat waste of misery.  At a passage in the rocks, where the brutes\r\nupreared hindlegged and stretched their forelegs upward like cats to\r\nclear the wall, the way was piled with carcasses where they had toppled\r\nback.  And here he stood, in the stench of hell, with a cheery word and a\r\nhand on the rump at the right time, till the string passed by.  And when\r\none bogged he blocked the trail till it was clear again; nor did the man\r\nlive who crowded him at such time.\r\n\r\n"At the end of the trail a man who had killed fifty horses wanted to buy,\r\nbut we looked at him and at our own,--mountain cayuses from eastern\r\nOregon.  Five thousand he offered, and we were broke, but we remembered\r\nthe poison grass of the Summit and the passage in the Rocks, and the man\r\nwho was my brother spoke no word, but divided the cayuses into two\r\nbunches,--his in the one and mine in the other,--and he looked at me and\r\nwe understood each other.  So he drove mine to the one side and I drove\r\nhis to the other, and we took with us our rifles and shot them to the\r\nlast one, while the man who had killed fifty horses cursed us till his\r\nthroat cracked.  But that man, with whom I welded blood-brothership on\r\nthe Dead Horse Trail--"\r\n\r\n"Why, that man was John Randolph," Fortune, sneering the while, completed\r\nthe climax for him.\r\n\r\nUri nodded, and said, "I am glad you understand."\r\n\r\n"I am ready," Fortune answered, the old weary bitterness strong in his\r\nface again.  "Go ahead, but hurry."\r\n\r\nUri Bram rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n"I have had faith in God all the days of my life.  I believe He loves\r\njustice.  I believe He is looking down upon us now, choosing between us.\r\nI believe He waits to work His will through my own right arm.  And such\r\nis my belief, that we will take equal chance and let Him speak His own\r\njudgment."\r\n\r\nFortune\'s heart leaped at the words.  He did not know much concerning\r\nUri\'s God, but he believed in Chance, and Chance had been coming his way\r\never since the night he ran down the beach and across the snow.  "But\r\nthere is only one gun," he objected.\r\n\r\n"We will fire turn about," Uri replied, at the same time throwing out the\r\ncylinder of the other man\'s Colt and examining it.\r\n\r\n"And the cards to decide!  One hand of seven up!"\r\n\r\nFortune\'s blood was warming to the game, and he drew the deck from his\r\npocket as Uri nodded.  Surely Chance would not desert him now!  He\r\nthought of the returning sun as he cut for deal, and he thrilled when he\r\nfound the deal was his.  He shuffled and dealt, and Uri cut him the Jack\r\nof Spades.  They laid down their hands.  Uri\'s was bare of trumps, while\r\nhe held ace, deuce.  The outside seemed very near to him as they stepped\r\noff the fifty paces.\r\n\r\n"If God withholds His hand and you drop me, the dogs and outfit are\r\nyours.  You\'ll find a bill of sale, already made out, in my pocket," Uri\r\nexplained, facing the path of the bullet, straight and broad-breasted.\r\n\r\nFortune shook a vision of the sun shining on the ocean from his eyes and\r\ntook aim.  He was very careful.  Twice he lowered as the spring breeze\r\nshook the pines.  But the third time he dropped on one knee, gripped the\r\nrevolver steadily in both hands, and fired.  Uri whirled half about,\r\nthrew up his arms, swayed wildly for a moment, and sank into the snow.\r\nBut Fortune knew he had fired too far to one side, else the man would not\r\nhave whirled.\r\n\r\nWhen Uri, mastering the flesh and struggling to his feet, beckoned for\r\nthe weapon, Fortune was minded to fire again.  But he thrust the idea\r\nfrom him.  Chance had been very good to him already, he felt, and if he\r\ntricked now he would have to pay for it afterward.  No, he would play\r\nfair.  Besides Uri was hard hit and could not possibly hold the heavy\r\nColt long enough to draw a bead.\r\n\r\n"And where is your God now?" he taunted, as he gave the wounded man the\r\nrevolver.\r\n\r\nAnd Uri answered: "God has not yet spoken.  Prepare that He may speak."\r\n\r\nFortune faced him, but twisted his chest sideways in order to present\r\nless surface.  Uri tottered about drunkenly, but waited, too, for the\r\nmoment\'s calm between the catspaws.  The revolver was very heavy, and he\r\ndoubted, like Fortune, because of its weight.  But he held it, arm\r\nextended, above his head, and then let it slowly drop forward and down.\r\nAt the instant Fortune\'s left breast and the sight flashed into line with\r\nhis eye, he pulled the trigger.  Fortune did not whirl, but gay San\r\nFrancisco dimmed and faded, and as the sun-bright snow turned black and\r\nblacker, he breathed his last malediction on the Chance he had misplayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIWASH\r\n\r\n\r\n"If I was a man--"  Her words were in themselves indecisive, but the\r\nwithering contempt which flashed from her black eyes was not lost upon\r\nthe men-folk in the tent.\r\n\r\nTommy, the English sailor, squirmed, but chivalrous old Dick Humphries,\r\nCornish fisherman and erstwhile American salmon capitalist, beamed upon\r\nher benevolently as ever.  He bore women too large a portion of his rough\r\nheart to mind them, as he said, when they were in the doldrums, or when\r\ntheir limited vision would not permit them to see all around a thing.  So\r\nthey said nothing, these two men who had taken the half-frozen woman into\r\ntheir tent three days back, and who had warmed her, and fed her, and\r\nrescued her goods from the Indian packers.  This latter had necessitated\r\nthe payment of numerous dollars, to say nothing of a demonstration in\r\nforce--Dick Humphries squinting along the sights of a Winchester while\r\nTommy apportioned their wages among them at his own appraisement.  It had\r\nbeen a little thing in itself, but it meant much to a woman playing a\r\ndesperate single-hand in the equally desperate Klondike rush of \'97.  Men\r\nwere occupied with their own pressing needs, nor did they approve of\r\nwomen playing, single-handed, the odds of the arctic winter.  "If I was a\r\nman, I know what I would do."  Thus reiterated Molly, she of the flashing\r\neyes, and therein spoke the cumulative grit of five American-born\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding silence, Tommy thrust a pan of biscuits into the Yukon\r\nstove and piled on fresh fuel.  A reddish flood pounded along under his\r\nsun-tanned skin, and as he stooped, the skin of his neck was scarlet.\r\nDick palmed a three-cornered sail needle through a set of broken pack\r\nstraps, his good nature in nowise disturbed by the feminine cataclysm\r\nwhich was threatening to burst in the storm-beaten tent.\r\n\r\n"And if you was a man?" he asked, his voice vibrant with kindness.  The\r\nthree-cornered needle jammed in the damp leather, and he suspended work\r\nfor the moment.\r\n\r\n"I\'d be a man.  I\'d put the straps on my back and light out.  I wouldn\'t\r\nlay in camp here, with the Yukon like to freeze most any day, and the\r\ngoods not half over the portage.  And you--you are men, and you sit here,\r\nholding your hands, afraid of a little wind and wet.  I tell you\r\nstraight, Yankee-men are made of different stuff.  They\'d be hitting the\r\ntrail for Dawson if they had to wade through hell-fire.  And you, you--I\r\nwish I was a man."\r\n\r\n"I\'m very glad, my dear, that you\'re not."  Dick Humphries threw the\r\nbight of the sail twine over the point of the needle and drew it clear\r\nwith a couple of deft turns and a jerk.\r\n\r\nA snort of the gale dealt the tent a broad-handed slap as it hurtled\r\npast, and the sleet rat-tat-tatted with snappy spite against the thin\r\ncanvas.  The smoke, smothered in its exit, drove back through the fire-\r\nbox door, carrying with it the pungent odor of green spruce.\r\n\r\n"Good Gawd!  Why can\'t a woman listen to reason?"  Tommy lifted his head\r\nfrom the denser depths and turned upon her a pair of smoke-outraged eyes.\r\n\r\n"And why can\'t a man show his manhood?"\r\n\r\nTommy sprang to his feet with an oath which would have shocked a woman of\r\nlesser heart, ripped loose the sturdy reef-knots and flung back the flaps\r\nof the tent.\r\n\r\nThe trio peered out.  It was not a heartening spectacle.  A few water-\r\nsoaked tents formed the miserable foreground, from which the streaming\r\nground sloped to a foaming gorge.  Down this ramped a mountain torrent.\r\nHere and there, dwarf spruce, rooting and grovelling in the shallow\r\nalluvium, marked the proximity of the timber line.  Beyond, on the\r\nopposing slope, the vague outlines of a glacier loomed dead-white through\r\nthe driving rain.  Even as they looked, its massive front crumbled into\r\nthe valley, on the breast of some subterranean vomit, and it lifted its\r\nhoarse thunder above the screeching voice of the storm.  Involuntarily,\r\nMolly shrank back.\r\n\r\n"Look, woman!  Look with all your eyes!  Three miles in the teeth of the\r\ngale to Crater Lake, across two glaciers, along the slippery rim-rock,\r\nknee-deep in a howling river!  Look, I say, you Yankee woman!  Look!\r\nThere\'s your Yankee-men!"  Tommy pointed a passionate hand in the\r\ndirection of the struggling tents.  "Yankees, the last mother\'s son of\r\nthem.  Are they on trail?  Is there one of them with the straps to his\r\nback?  And you would teach us men our work?  Look, I say!"\r\n\r\nAnother tremendous section of the glacier rumbled earthward.  The wind\r\nwhipped in at the open doorway, bulging out the sides of the tent till it\r\nswayed like a huge bladder at its guy ropes.  The smoke swirled about\r\nthem, and the sleet drove sharply into their flesh.  Tommy pulled the\r\nflaps together hastily, and returned to his tearful task at the fire-box.\r\nDick Humphries threw the mended pack straps into a corner and lighted his\r\npipe.  Even Molly was for the moment persuaded.\r\n\r\n"There\'s my clothes," she half-whimpered, the feminine for the moment\r\nprevailing.  "They\'re right at the top of the cache, and they\'ll be\r\nruined!  I tell you, ruined!"\r\n\r\n"There, there," Dick interposed, when the last quavering syllable had\r\nwailed itself out.  "Don\'t let that worry you, little woman.  I\'m old\r\nenough to be your father\'s brother, and I\'ve a daughter older than you,\r\nand I\'ll tog you out in fripperies when we get to Dawson if it takes my\r\nlast dollar."\r\n\r\n"When we get to Dawson!"  The scorn had come back to her throat with a\r\nsudden surge.  "You\'ll rot on the way, first.  You\'ll drown in a mudhole.\r\nYou--you--Britishers!"\r\n\r\nThe last word, explosive, intensive, had strained the limits of her\r\nvituperation.  If that would not stir these men, what could?  Tommy\'s\r\nneck ran red again, but he kept his tongue between his teeth.  Dick\'s\r\neyes mellowed.  He had the advantage over Tommy, for he had once had a\r\nwhite woman for a wife.\r\n\r\nThe blood of five American-born generations is, under certain\r\ncircumstances, an uncomfortable heritage; and among these circumstances\r\nmight be enumerated that of being quartered with next of kin.  These men\r\nwere Britons.  On sea and land her ancestry and the generations thereof\r\nhad thrashed them and theirs.  On sea and land they would continue to do\r\nso.  The traditions of her race clamored for vindication.  She was but a\r\nwoman of the present, but in her bubbled the whole mighty past.  It was\r\nnot alone Molly Travis who pulled on gum boots, mackintosh, and straps;\r\nfor the phantom hands of ten thousand forbears drew tight the buckles,\r\njust so as they squared her jaw and set her eyes with determination.  She,\r\nMolly Travis, intended to shame these Britishers; they, the innumerable\r\nshades, were asserting the dominance of the common race.\r\n\r\nThe men-folk did not interfere.  Once Dick suggested that she take his\r\noilskins, as her mackintosh was worth no more than paper in such a storm.\r\nBut she sniffed her independence so sharply that he communed with his\r\npipe till she tied the flaps on the outside and slushed away on the\r\nflooded trail.\r\n\r\n"Think she\'ll make it?"  Dick\'s face belied the indifference of his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"Make it?  If she stands the pressure till she gets to the cache, what of\r\nthe cold and misery, she\'ll be stark, raving mad.  Stand it?  She\'ll be\r\ndumb-crazed.  You know it yourself, Dick.  You\'ve wind-jammed round the\r\nHorn.  You know what it is to lay out on a topsail yard in the thick of\r\nit, bucking sleet and snow and frozen canvas till you\'re ready to just\r\nlet go and cry like a baby.  Clothes?  She won\'t be able to tell a bundle\r\nof skirts from a gold pan or a tea-kettle."\r\n\r\n"Kind of think we were wrong in letting her go, then?"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit of it.  So help me, Dick, she\'d \'a\' made this tent a hell for\r\nthe rest of the trip if we hadn\'t.  Trouble with her she\'s got too much\r\nspirit.  This\'ll tone it down a bit."\r\n\r\n"Yes," Dick admitted, "she\'s too ambitious.  But then Molly\'s all right.\r\nA cussed little fool to tackle a trip like this, but a plucky sight\r\nbetter than those pick-me-up-and-carry-me kind of women.  She\'s the stock\r\nthat carried you and me, Tommy, and you\'ve got to make allowance for the\r\nspirit.  Takes a woman to breed a man.  You can\'t suck manhood from the\r\ndugs of a creature whose only claim to womanhood is her petticoats.  Takes\r\na she-cat, not a cow, to mother a tiger."\r\n\r\n"And when they\'re unreasonable we\'ve got to put up with it, eh?"\r\n\r\n"The proposition.  A sharp sheath-knife cuts deeper on a slip than a dull\r\none; but that\'s no reason for to hack the edge off over a capstan bar."\r\n\r\n"All right, if you say so, but when it comes to woman, I guess I\'ll take\r\nmine with a little less edge."\r\n\r\n"What do you know about it?" Dick demanded.\r\n\r\n"Some."  Tommy reached over for a pair of Molly\'s wet stockings and\r\nstretched them across his knees to dry.\r\n\r\nDick, eying him querulously, went fishing in her hand satchel, then\r\nhitched up to the front of the stove with divers articles of damp\r\nclothing spread likewise to the heat.\r\n\r\n"Thought you said you never were married?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Did I?  No more was I--that is--yes, by Gawd! I was.  And as good a\r\nwoman as ever cooked grub for a man."\r\n\r\n"Slipped her moorings?" Dick symbolized infinity with a wave of his hand.\r\n\r\n"Ay."\r\n\r\n"Childbirth," he added, after a moment\'s pause.\r\n\r\nThe beans bubbled rowdily on the front lid, and he pushed the pot back to\r\na cooler surface.  After that he investigated the biscuits, tested them\r\nwith a splinter of wood, and placed them aside under cover of a damp\r\ncloth.  Dick, after the manner of his kind, stifled his interest and\r\nwaited silently.  "A different woman to Molly.  Siwash."\r\n\r\nDick nodded his understanding.\r\n\r\n"Not so proud and wilful, but stick by a fellow through thick and thin.\r\nSling a paddle with the next and starve as contentedly as Job.  Go\r\nfor\'ard when the sloop\'s nose was more often under than not, and take in\r\nsail like a man.  Went prospecting once, up Teslin way, past Surprise\r\nLake and the Little Yellow-Head.  Grub gave out, and we ate the dogs.\r\nDogs gave out, and we ate harnesses, moccasins, and furs.  Never a\r\nwhimper; never a pick-me-up-and-carry-me.  Before we went she said look\r\nout for grub, but when it happened, never a I-told-you-so.  \'Never mind,\r\nTommy,\' she\'d say, day after day, that weak she could bare lift a snow-\r\nshoe and her feet raw with the work.  \'Never mind.  I\'d sooner be flat-\r\nbellied of hunger and be your woman, Tommy, than have a _potlach_ every\r\nday and be Chief George\'s _klooch_.\'  George was chief of the Chilcoots,\r\nyou know, and wanted her bad.\r\n\r\n"Great days, those.  Was a likely chap myself when I struck the coast.\r\nJumped a whaler, the _Pole Star_, at Unalaska, and worked my way down to\r\nSitka on an otter hunter.  Picked up with Happy Jack there--know him?"\r\n\r\n"Had charge of my traps for me," Dick answered, "down on the Columbia.\r\nPretty wild, wasn\'t he, with a warm place in his heart for whiskey and\r\nwomen?"\r\n\r\n"The very chap.  Went trading with him for a couple of seasons--_hooch_,\r\nand blankets, and such stuff.  Then got a sloop of my own, and not to cut\r\nhim out, came down Juneau way.  That\'s where I met Killisnoo; I called\r\nher Tilly for short.  Met her at a squaw dance down on the beach.  Chief\r\nGeorge had finished the year\'s trade with the Sticks over the Passes, and\r\nwas down from Dyea with half his tribe.  No end of Siwashes at the dance,\r\nand I the only white.  No one knew me, barring a few of the bucks I\'d met\r\nover Sitka way, but I\'d got most of their histories from Happy Jack.\r\n\r\n"Everybody talking Chinook, not guessing that I could spit it better than\r\nmost; and principally two girls who\'d run away from Haine\'s Mission up\r\nthe Lynn Canal.  They were trim creatures, good to the eye, and I kind of\r\nthought of casting that way; but they were fresh as fresh-caught cod.  Too\r\nmuch edge, you see.  Being a new-comer, they started to twist me, not\r\nknowing I gathered in every word of Chinook they uttered.\r\n\r\n"I never let on, but set to dancing with Tilly, and the more we danced\r\nthe more our hearts warmed to each other.  \'Looking for a woman,\' one of\r\nthe girls says, and the other tosses her head and answers, \'Small chance\r\nhe\'ll get one when the women are looking for men.\'  And the bucks and\r\nsquaws standing around began to grin and giggle and repeat what had been\r\nsaid.  \'Quite a pretty boy,\' says the first one.  I\'ll not deny I was\r\nrather smooth-faced and youngish, but I\'d been a man amongst men many\'s\r\nthe day, and it rankled me.  \'Dancing with Chief George\'s girl,\' pipes\r\nthe second.  \'First thing George\'ll give him the flat of a paddle and\r\nsend him about his business.\'  Chief George had been looking pretty black\r\nup to now, but at this he laughed and slapped his knees.  He was a husky\r\nbeggar and would have used the paddle too.\r\n\r\n"\'Who\'s the girls?\' I asked Tilly, as we went ripping down the centre in\r\na reel.  And as soon as she told me their names I remembered all about\r\nthem from Happy Jack.  Had their pedigree down fine--several things he\'d\r\ntold me that not even their own tribe knew.  But I held my hush, and went\r\non courting Tilly, they a-casting sharp remarks and everybody roaring.\r\n\'Bide a wee, Tommy,\' I says to myself; \'bide a wee.\'\r\n\r\n"And bide I did, till the dance was ripe to break up, and Chief George\r\nhad brought a paddle all ready for me.  Everybody was on the lookout for\r\nmischief when we stopped; but I marched, easy as you please, slap into\r\nthe thick of them.  The Mission girls cut me up something clever, and for\r\nall I was angry I had to set my teeth to keep from laughing.  I turned\r\nupon them suddenly.\r\n\r\n"\'Are you done?\' I asked.\r\n\r\n"You should have seen them when they heard me spitting Chinook.  Then I\r\nbroke loose.  I told them all about themselves, and their people before\r\nthem; their fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers--everybody, everything.\r\nEach mean trick they\'d played; every scrape they\'d got into; every shame\r\nthat\'d fallen them.  And I burned them without fear or favor.  All hands\r\ncrowded round.  Never had they heard a white man sling their lingo as I\r\ndid.  Everybody was laughing save the Mission girls.  Even Chief George\r\nforgot the paddle, or at least he was swallowing too much respect to dare\r\nto use it.\r\n\r\n"But the girls.  \'Oh, don\'t, Tommy,\' they cried, the tears running down\r\ntheir cheeks.  \'Please don\'t.  We\'ll be good.  Sure, Tommy, sure.\'  But I\r\nknew them well, and I scorched them on every tender spot.  Nor did I\r\nslack away till they came down on their knees, begging and pleading with\r\nme to keep quiet.  Then I shot a glance at Chief George; but he did not\r\nknow whether to have at me or not, and passed it off by laughing\r\nhollowly.\r\n\r\n"So be.  When I passed the parting with Tilly that night I gave her the\r\nword that I was going to be around for a week or so, and that I wanted to\r\nsee more of her.  Not thick-skinned, her kind, when it came to showing\r\nlike and dislike, and she looked her pleasure for the honest girl she\r\nwas.  Ay, a striking lass, and I didn\'t wonder that Chief George was\r\ntaken with her.\r\n\r\n"Everything my way.  Took the wind from his sails on the first leg.  I\r\nwas for getting her aboard and sailing down Wrangel way till it blew\r\nover, leaving him to whistle; but I wasn\'t to get her that easy.  Seems\r\nshe was living with an uncle of hers--guardian, the way such things\r\ngo--and seems he was nigh to shuffling off with consumption or some sort\r\nof lung trouble.  He was good and bad by turns, and she wouldn\'t leave\r\nhim till it was over with.  Went up to the tepee just before I left, to\r\nspeculate on how long it\'d be; but the old beggar had promised her to\r\nChief George, and when he clapped eyes on me his anger brought on a\r\nhemorrhage.\r\n\r\n"\'Come and take me, Tommy,\' she says when we bid good-by on the beach.\r\n\'Ay,\' I answers; \'when you give the word.\'  And I kissed her, white-man-\r\nfashion and lover-fashion, till she was all of a tremble like a quaking\r\naspen, and I was so beside myself I\'d half a mind to go up and give the\r\nuncle a lift over the divide.\r\n\r\n"So I went down Wrangel way, past St. Mary\'s and even to the Queen\r\nCharlottes, trading, running whiskey, turning the sloop to most anything.\r\nWinter was on, stiff and crisp, and I was back to Juneau, when the word\r\ncame.  \'Come,\' the beggar says who brought the news.  \'Killisnoo say,\r\n"Come now."\'  \'What\'s the row?\' I asks.  \'Chief George,\' says he.\r\n\'_Potlach_.  Killisnoo, makum _klooch_.\'\r\n\r\n"Ay, it was bitter--the Taku howling down out of the north, the salt\r\nwater freezing quick as it struck the deck, and the old sloop and I\r\nhammering into the teeth of it for a hundred miles to Dyea.  Had a\r\nDouglass Islander for crew when I started, but midway up he was washed\r\nover from the bows.  Jibed all over and crossed the course three times,\r\nbut never a sign of him."\r\n\r\n"Doubled up with the cold most likely," Dick suggested, putting a pause\r\ninto the narrative while he hung one of Molly\'s skirts up to dry, "and\r\nwent down like a pot of lead."\r\n\r\n"My idea.  So I finished the course alone, half-dead when I made Dyea in\r\nthe dark of the evening.  The tide favored, and I ran the sloop plump to\r\nthe bank, in the shelter of the river.  Couldn\'t go an inch further, for\r\nthe fresh water was frozen solid.  Halyards and blocks were that iced up\r\nI didn\'t dare lower mainsail or jib.  First I broached a pint of the\r\ncargo raw, and then, leaving all standing, ready for the start, and with\r\na blanket around me, headed across the flat to the camp.  No mistaking,\r\nit was a grand layout.  The Chilcats had come in a body--dogs, babies,\r\nand canoes--to say nothing of the Dog-Ears, the Little Salmons, and the\r\nMissions.  Full half a thousand of them to celebrate Tilly\'s wedding, and\r\nnever a white man in a score of miles.\r\n\r\n"Nobody took note of me, the blanket over my head and hiding my face, and\r\nI waded knee deep through the dogs and youngsters till I was well up to\r\nthe front.  The show was being pulled off in a big open place among the\r\ntrees, with great fires burning and the snow moccasin-packed as hard as\r\nPortland cement.  Next me was Tilly, beaded and scarlet-clothed galore,\r\nand against her Chief George and his head men.  The shaman was being\r\nhelped out by the big medicines from the other tribes, and it shivered my\r\nspine up and down, the deviltries they cut.  I caught myself wondering if\r\nthe folks in Liverpool could only see me now; and I thought of yellow-\r\nhaired Gussie, whose brother I licked after my first voyage, just because\r\nhe was not for having a sailorman courting his sister.  And with Gussie\r\nin my eyes I looked at Tilly.  A rum old world, thinks I, with man\r\na-stepping in trails the mother little dreamed of when he lay at suck.\r\n\r\n"So be.  When the noise was loudest, walrus hides booming and priests a-\r\nsinging, I says, \'Are you ready?\'  Gawd!  Not a start, not a shot of the\r\neyes my way, not the twitch of a muscle.  \'I knew,\' she answers, slow and\r\nsteady as a calm spring tide.  \'Where?\'  \'The high bank at the edge of\r\nthe ice,\' I whispers back.  \'Jump out when I give the word.\'\r\n\r\n"Did I say there was no end of huskies?  Well, there was no end.  Here,\r\nthere, everywhere, they were scattered about,--tame wolves and nothing\r\nless.  When the strain runs thin they breed them in the bush with the\r\nwild, and they\'re bitter fighters.  Right at the toe of my moccasin lay a\r\nbig brute, and by the heel another.  I doubled the first one\'s tail,\r\nquick, till it snapped in my grip.  As his jaws clipped together where my\r\nhand should have been, I threw the second one by the scruff straight into\r\nhis mouth.  \'Go!\' I cried to Tilly.\r\n\r\n"You know how they fight.  In the wink of an eye there was a raging\r\nhundred of them, top and bottom, ripping and tearing each other, kids and\r\nsquaws tumbling which way, and the camp gone wild.  Tilly\'d slipped away,\r\nso I followed.  But when I looked over my shoulder at the skirt of the\r\ncrowd, the devil laid me by the heart, and I dropped the blanket and went\r\nback.\r\n\r\n"By then the dogs\'d been knocked apart and the crowd was untangling\r\nitself.  Nobody was in proper place, so they didn\'t note that Tilly\'d\r\ngone.  \'Hello,\' I says, gripping Chief George by the hand.  \'May your\r\npotlach-smoke rise often, and the Sticks bring many furs with the\r\nspring.\'\r\n\r\n"Lord love me, Dick, but he was joyed to see me,--him with the upper hand\r\nand wedding Tilly.  Chance to puff big over me.  The tale that I was hot\r\nafter her had spread through the camps, and my presence did him proud.\r\nAll hands knew me, without my blanket, and set to grinning and giggling.\r\nIt was rich, but I made it richer by playing unbeknowing.\r\n\r\n"\'What\'s the row?\' I asks.  \'Who\'s getting married now?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Chief George,\' the shaman says, ducking his reverence to him.\r\n\r\n"\'Thought he had two _klooches_.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Him takum more,--three,\' with another duck.\r\n\r\n"\'Oh!\'  And I turned away as though it didn\'t interest me.\r\n\r\n"But this wouldn\'t do, and everybody begins singing out, \'Killisnoo!\r\nKillisnoo!\'\r\n\r\n"\'Killisnoo what?\' I asked.\r\n\r\n"\'Killisnoo, _klooch_, Chief George,\' they blathered.  \'Killisnoo,\r\n_klooch_.\'\r\n\r\n"I jumped and looked at Chief George.  He nodded his head and threw out\r\nhis chest.\r\n\r\n"She\'ll be no _klooch_ of yours,\' I says solemnly.  \'No _klooch_ of\r\nyours,\' I repeats, while his face went black and his hand began dropping\r\nto his hunting-knife.\r\n\r\n"\'Look!\' I cries, striking an attitude.  \'Big Medicine.  You watch my\r\nsmoke.\'\r\n\r\n"I pulled off my mittens, rolled back my sleeves, and made half-a-dozen\r\npasses in the air.\r\n\r\n"\'Killisnoo!\' I shouts.  \'Killisnoo!  Killisnoo!\'\r\n\r\n"I was making medicine, and they began to scare.  Every eye was on me; no\r\ntime to find out that Tilly wasn\'t there.  Then I called Killisnoo three\r\ntimes again, and waited; and three times more.  All for mystery and to\r\nmake them nervous.  Chief George couldn\'t guess what I was up to, and\r\nwanted to put a stop to the foolery; but the shamans said to wait, and\r\nthat they\'d see me and go me one better, or words to that effect.\r\nBesides, he was a superstitious cuss, and I fancy a bit afraid of the\r\nwhite man\'s magic.\r\n\r\n"Then I called Killisnoo, long and soft like the howl of a wolf, till the\r\nwomen were all a-tremble and the bucks looking serious.\r\n\r\n"\'Look!\' I sprang for\'ard, pointing my finger into a bunch of\r\nsquaws--easier to deceive women than men, you know.  \'Look!\'  And I\r\nraised it aloft as though following the flight of a bird.  Up, up,\r\nstraight overhead, making to follow it with my eyes till it disappeared\r\nin the sky.\r\n\r\n"\'Killisnoo,\' I said, looking at Chief George and pointing upward again.\r\n\'Killisnoo.\'\r\n\r\n"So help me, Dick, the gammon worked.  Half of them, at least, saw Tilly\r\ndisappear in the air.  They\'d drunk my whiskey at Juneau and seen\r\nstranger sights, I\'ll warrant.  Why should I not do this thing, I, who\r\nsold bad spirits corked in bottles?  Some of the women shrieked.\r\nEverybody fell to whispering in bunches.  I folded my arms and held my\r\nhead high, and they drew further away from me.  The time was ripe to go.\r\n\'Grab him,\' Chief George cries.  Three or four of them came at me, but I\r\nwhirled, quick, made a couple of passes like to send them after Tilly,\r\nand pointed up.  Touch me?  Not for the kingdoms of the earth.  Chief\r\nGeorge harangued them, but he couldn\'t get them to lift a leg.  Then he\r\nmade to take me himself; but I repeated the mummery and his grit went out\r\nthrough his fingers.\r\n\r\n"\'Let your shamans work wonders the like of which I have done this\r\nnight,\' I says.  \'Let them call Killisnoo down out of the sky whither I\r\nhave sent her.\'  But the priests knew their limits.  \'May your _klooches_\r\nbear you sons as the spawn of the salmon,\' I says, turning to go; \'and\r\nmay your totem pole stand long in the land, and the smoke of your camp\r\nrise always.\'\r\n\r\n"But if the beggars could have seen me hitting the high places for the\r\nsloop as soon as I was clear of them, they\'d thought my own medicine had\r\ngot after me.  Tilly\'d kept warm by chopping the ice away, and was all\r\nready to cast off.  Gawd! how we ran before it, the Taku howling after us\r\nand the freezing seas sweeping over at every clip.  With everything\r\nbattened down, me a-steering and Tilly chopping ice, we held on half the\r\nnight, till I plumped the sloop ashore on Porcupine Island, and we\r\nshivered it out on the beach; blankets wet, and Tilly drying the matches\r\non her breast.\r\n\r\n"So I think I know something about it.  Seven years, Dick, man and wife,\r\nin rough sailing and smooth.  And then she died, in the heart of the\r\nwinter, died in childbirth, up there on the Chilcat Station.  She held my\r\nhand to the last, the ice creeping up inside the door and spreading thick\r\non the gut of the window.  Outside, the lone howl of the wolf and the\r\nSilence; inside, death and the Silence.  You\'ve never heard the Silence\r\nyet, Dick, and Gawd grant you don\'t ever have to hear it when you sit by\r\nthe side of death.  Hear it?  Ay, till the breath whistles like a siren,\r\nand the heart booms, booms, booms, like the surf on the shore.\r\n\r\n"Siwash, Dick, but a woman.  White, Dick, white, clear through.  Towards\r\nthe last she says, \'Keep my feather bed, Tommy, keep it always.\'  And I\r\nagreed.  Then she opened her eyes, full with the pain.  \'I\'ve been a good\r\nwoman to you, Tommy, and because of that I want you to promise--to\r\npromise\'--the words seemed to stick in her throat--\'that when you marry,\r\nthe woman be white.  No more Siwash, Tommy.  I know.  Plenty white women\r\ndown to Juneau now.  I know.  Your people call you "squaw-man," your\r\nwomen turn their heads to the one side on the street, and you do not go\r\nto their cabins like other men.  Why?  Your wife Siwash.  Is it not so?\r\nAnd this is not good.  Wherefore I die.  Promise me.  Kiss me in token of\r\nyour promise.\'\r\n\r\n"I kissed her, and she dozed off, whispering, \'It is good.\'  At the end,\r\nthat near gone my ear was at her lips, she roused for the last time.\r\n\'Remember, Tommy; remember my feather bed.\'  Then she died, in\r\nchildbirth, up there on the Chilcat Station."\r\n\r\nThe tent heeled over and half flattened before the gale.  Dick refilled\r\nhis pipe, while Tommy drew the tea and set it aside against Molly\'s\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nAnd she of the flashing eyes and Yankee blood?  Blinded, falling,\r\ncrawling on hand and knee, the wind thrust back in her throat by the\r\nwind, she was heading for the tent.  On her shoulders a bulky pack caught\r\nthe full fury of the storm.  She plucked feebly at the knotted flaps, but\r\nit was Tommy and Dick who cast them loose.  Then she set her soul for the\r\nlast effort, staggered in, and fell exhausted on the floor.\r\n\r\nTommy unbuckled the straps and took the pack from her.  As he lifted it\r\nthere was a clanging of pots and pans.  Dick, pouring out a mug of\r\nwhiskey, paused long enough to pass the wink across her body.  Tommy\r\nwinked back.  His lips pursed the monosyllable, "clothes," but Dick shook\r\nhis head reprovingly.  "Here, little woman," he said, after she had drunk\r\nthe whiskey and straightened up a bit.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s some dry togs.  Climb into them.  We\'re going out to extra-peg\r\nthe tent.  After that, give us the call, and we\'ll come in and have\r\ndinner.  Sing out when you\'re ready."\r\n\r\n"So help me, Dick, that\'s knocked the edge off her for the rest of this\r\ntrip," Tommy spluttered as they crouched to the lee of the tent.\r\n\r\n"But it\'s the edge is her saving grace." Dick replied, ducking his head\r\nto a volley of sleet that drove around a corner of the canvas.  "The edge\r\nthat you and I\'ve got, Tommy, and the edge of our mothers before us."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAN WITH THE GASH\r\n\r\n\r\nJacob Kent had suffered from cupidity all the days of his life.  This, in\r\nturn, had engendered a chronic distrustfulness, and his mind and\r\ncharacter had become so warped that he was a very disagreeable man to\r\ndeal with.  He was also a victim to somnambulic propensities, and very\r\nset in his ideas.  He had been a weaver of cloth from the cradle, until\r\nthe fever of Klondike had entered his blood and torn him away from his\r\nloom.  His cabin stood midway between Sixty Mile Post and the Stuart\r\nRiver; and men who made it a custom to travel the trail to Dawson,\r\nlikened him to a robber baron, perched in his fortress and exacting toll\r\nfrom the caravans that used his ill-kept roads.  Since a certain amount\r\nof history was required in the construction of this figure, the less\r\ncultured wayfarers from Stuart River were prone to describe him after a\r\nstill more primordial fashion, in which a command of strong adjectives\r\nwas to be chiefly noted.\r\n\r\nThis cabin was not his, by the way, having been built several years\r\npreviously by a couple of miners who had got out a raft of logs at that\r\npoint for a grub-stake.  They had been most hospitable lads, and, after\r\nthey abandoned it, travelers who knew the route made it an object to\r\narrive there at nightfall.  It was very handy, saving them all the time\r\nand toil of pitching camp; and it was an unwritten rule that the last man\r\nleft a neat pile of firewood for the next comer.  Rarely a night passed\r\nbut from half a dozen to a score of men crowded into its shelter.  Jacob\r\nKent noted these things, exercised squatter sovereignty, and moved in.\r\nThenceforth, the weary travelers were mulcted a dollar per head for the\r\nprivilege of sleeping on the floor, Jacob Kent weighing the dust and\r\nnever failing to steal the down-weight.  Besides, he so contrived that\r\nhis transient guests chopped his wood for him and carried his water.  This\r\nwas rank piracy, but his victims were an easy-going breed, and while they\r\ndetested him, they yet permitted him to flourish in his sins.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon in April he sat by his door,--for all the world like a\r\npredatory spider,--marvelling at the heat of the returning sun, and\r\nkeeping an eye on the trail for prospective flies.  The Yukon lay at his\r\nfeet, a sea of ice, disappearing around two great bends to the north and\r\nsouth, and stretching an honest two miles from bank to bank.  Over its\r\nrough breast ran the sled-trail, a slender sunken line, eighteen inches\r\nwide and two thousand miles in length, with more curses distributed to\r\nthe linear foot than any other road in or out of all Christendom.\r\n\r\nJacob Kent was feeling particularly good that afternoon.  The record had\r\nbeen broken the previous night, and he had sold his hospitality to no\r\nless than twenty-eight visitors.  True, it had been quite uncomfortable,\r\nand four had snored beneath his bunk all night; but then it had added\r\nappreciable weight to the sack in which he kept his gold dust.  That\r\nsack, with its glittering yellow treasure, was at once the chief delight\r\nand the chief bane of his existence.  Heaven and hell lay within its\r\nslender mouth.  In the nature of things, there being no privacy to his\r\none-roomed dwelling, he was tortured by a constant fear of theft.  It\r\nwould be very easy for these bearded, desperate-looking strangers to make\r\naway with it.  Often he dreamed that such was the case, and awoke in the\r\ngrip of nightmare.  A select number of these robbers haunted him through\r\nhis dreams, and he came to know them quite well, especially the bronzed\r\nleader with the gash on his right cheek.  This fellow was the most\r\npersistent of the lot, and, because of him, he had, in his waking\r\nmoments, constructed several score of hiding-places in and about the\r\ncabin.  After a concealment he would breathe freely again, perhaps for\r\nseveral nights, only to collar the Man with the Gash in the very act of\r\nunearthing the sack.  Then, on awakening in the midst of the usual\r\nstruggle, he would at once get up and transfer the bag to a new and more\r\ningenious crypt.  It was not that he was the direct victim of these\r\nphantasms; but he believed in omens and thought-transference, and he\r\ndeemed these dream-robbers to be the astral projection of real personages\r\nwho happened at those particular moments, no matter where they were in\r\nthe flesh, to be harboring designs, in the spirit, upon his wealth.  So\r\nhe continued to bleed the unfortunates who crossed his threshold, and at\r\nthe same time to add to his trouble with every ounce that went into the\r\nsack.\r\n\r\nAs he sat sunning himself, a thought came to Jacob Kent that brought him\r\nto his feet with a jerk.  The pleasures of life had culminated in the\r\ncontinual weighing and reweighing of his dust; but a shadow had been\r\nthrown upon this pleasant avocation, which he had hitherto failed to\r\nbrush aside.  His gold-scales were quite small; in fact, their maximum\r\nwas a pound and a half,--eighteen ounces,--while his hoard mounted up to\r\nsomething like three and a third times that.  He had never been able to\r\nweigh it all at one operation, and hence considered himself to have been\r\nshut out from a new and most edifying coign of contemplation.  Being\r\ndenied this, half the pleasure of possession had been lost; nay, he felt\r\nthat this miserable obstacle actually minimized the fact, as it did the\r\nstrength, of possession.  It was the solution of this problem flashing\r\nacross his mind that had just brought him to his feet.  He searched the\r\ntrail carefully in either direction.  There was nothing in sight, so he\r\nwent inside.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds he had the table cleared away and the scales set up.  On\r\none side he placed the stamped disks to the equivalent of fifteen ounces,\r\nand balanced it with dust on the other.  Replacing the weights with dust,\r\nhe then had thirty ounces precisely balanced.  These, in turn, he placed\r\ntogether on one side and again balanced with more dust.  By this time the\r\ngold was exhausted, and he was sweating liberally.  He trembled with\r\necstasy, ravished beyond measure.  Nevertheless he dusted the sack\r\nthoroughly, to the last least grain, till the balance was overcome and\r\none side of the scales sank to the table.  Equilibrium, however, was\r\nrestored by the addition of a pennyweight and five grains to the opposite\r\nside.  He stood, head thrown back, transfixed.  The sack was empty, but\r\nthe potentiality of the scales had become immeasurable.  Upon them he\r\ncould weigh any amount, from the tiniest grain to pounds upon pounds.\r\nMammon laid hot fingers on his heart.  The sun swung on its westering way\r\ntill it flashed through the open doorway, full upon the yellow-burdened\r\nscales.  The precious heaps, like the golden breasts of a bronze\r\nCleopatra, flung back the light in a mellow glow.  Time and space were\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n"Gawd blime me! but you \'ave the makin\' of several quid there, \'aven\'t\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\nJacob Kent wheeled about, at the same time reaching for his\r\ndouble-barrelled shotgun, which stood handy.  But when his eyes lit on\r\nthe intruder\'s face, he staggered back dizzily.  _It was the face of the\r\nMan with the Gash_!\r\n\r\nThe man looked at him curiously.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s all right," he said, waving his hand deprecatingly.  "You\r\nneedn\'t think as I\'ll \'arm you or your blasted dust.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a rum \'un, you are," he added reflectively, as he watched the\r\nsweat pouring from off Kent\'s face and the quavering of his knees.\r\n\r\n"W\'y don\'t you pipe up an\' say somethin\'?" he went on, as the other\r\nstruggled for breath.  "Wot\'s gone wrong o\' your gaff?  Anythink the\r\nmatter?"\r\n\r\n"W--w--where\'d you get it?" Kent at last managed to articulate, raising a\r\nshaking forefinger to the ghastly scar which seamed the other\'s cheek.\r\n\r\n"Shipmate stove me down with a marlin-spike from the main-royal.  An\' now\r\nas you \'ave your figger\'ead in trim, wot I want to know is, wot\'s it to\r\nyou?  That\'s wot I want to know--wot\'s it to you?  Gawd blime me! do it\r\n\'urt you?  Ain\'t it smug enough for the likes o\' you?  That\'s wot I want\r\nto know!"\r\n\r\n"No, no," Kent answered, sinking upon a stool with a sickly grin.  "I was\r\njust wondering."\r\n\r\n"Did you ever see the like?" the other went on truculently.\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t it a beute?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."  Kent nodded his head approvingly, intent on humoring this strange\r\nvisitor, but wholly unprepared for the outburst which was to follow his\r\neffort to be agreeable.\r\n\r\n"You blasted, bloomin\', burgoo-eatin\' son-of-a-sea-swab!  Wot do you\r\nmean, a sayin\' the most onsightly thing Gawd Almighty ever put on the\r\nface o\' man is a beute?  Wot do you mean, you--"\r\n\r\nAnd thereat this fiery son of the sea broke off into a string of Oriental\r\nprofanity, mingling gods and devils, lineages and men, metaphors and\r\nmonsters, with so savage a virility that Jacob Kent was paralyzed.  He\r\nshrank back, his arms lifted as though to ward off physical violence.  So\r\nutterly unnerved was he that the other paused in the mid-swing of a\r\ngorgeous peroration and burst into thunderous laughter.\r\n\r\n"The sun\'s knocked the bottom out o\' the trail," said the Man with the\r\nGash, between departing paroxysms of mirth.  "An\' I only \'ope as you\'ll\r\nappreciate the hoppertunity of consortin\' with a man o\' my mug.  Get\r\nsteam up in that fire-box o\' your\'n.  I\'m goin\' to unrig the dogs an\'\r\ngrub \'em.  An\' don\'t be shy o\' the wood, my lad; there\'s plenty more\r\nwhere that come from, and it\'s you\'ve got the time to sling an axe.  An\'\r\ntote up a bucket o\' water while you\'re about it.  Lively! or I\'ll run you\r\ndown, so \'elp me!"\r\n\r\nSuch a thing was unheard of.  Jacob Kent was making the fire, chopping\r\nwood, packing water--doing menial tasks for a guest!  When Jim Cardegee\r\nleft Dawson, it was with his head filled with the iniquities of this\r\nroadside Shylock; and all along the trail his numerous victims had added\r\nto the sum of his crimes.  Now, Jim Cardegee, with the sailor\'s love for\r\na sailor\'s joke, had determined, when he pulled into the cabin, to bring\r\nits inmate down a peg or so.  That he had succeeded beyond expectation he\r\ncould not help but remark, though he was in the dark as to the part the\r\ngash on his cheek had played in it.  But while he could not understand,\r\nhe saw the terror it created, and resolved to exploit it as remorselessly\r\nas would any modern trader a choice bit of merchandise.\r\n\r\n"Strike me blind, but you\'re a \'ustler," he said admiringly, his head\r\ncocked to one side, as his host bustled about.  "You never \'ort to \'ave\r\ngone Klondiking.  It\'s the keeper of a pub\' you was laid out for.  An\'\r\nit\'s often as I \'ave \'eard the lads up an\' down the river speak o\' you,\r\nbut I \'adn\'t no idea you was so jolly nice."\r\n\r\nJacob Kent experienced a tremendous yearning to try his shotgun on him,\r\nbut the fascination of the gash was too potent.  This was the real Man\r\nwith the Gash, the man who had so often robbed him in the spirit.  This,\r\nthen, was the embodied entity of the being whose astral form had been\r\nprojected into his dreams, the man who had so frequently harbored designs\r\nagainst his hoard; hence--there could be no other conclusion--this Man\r\nwith the Gash had now come in the flesh to dispossess him.  And that\r\ngash!  He could no more keep his eyes from it than stop the beating of\r\nhis heart.  Try as he would, they wandered back to that one point as\r\ninevitably as the needle to the pole.\r\n\r\n"Do it \'urt you?" Jim Cardegee thundered suddenly, looking up from the\r\nspreading of his blankets and encountering the rapt gaze of the other.\r\n"It strikes me as \'ow it \'ud be the proper thing for you to draw your\r\njib, douse the glim, an\' turn in, seein\' as \'ow it worrits you.  Jes\' lay\r\nto that, you swab, or so \'elp me I\'ll take a pull on your\r\npeak-purchases!"\r\n\r\nKent was so nervous that it took three puffs to blow out the slush-lamp,\r\nand he crawled into his blankets without even removing his moccasins.  The\r\nsailor was soon snoring lustily from his hard bed on the floor, but Kent\r\nlay staring up into the blackness, one hand on the shotgun, resolved not\r\nto close his eyes the whole night.  He had not had an opportunity to\r\nsecrete his five pounds of gold, and it lay in the ammunition box at the\r\nhead of his bunk.  But, try as he would, he at last dozed off with the\r\nweight of his dust heavy on his soul.  Had he not inadvertently fallen\r\nasleep with his mind in such condition, the somnambulic demon would not\r\nhave been invoked, nor would Jim Cardegee have gone mining next day with\r\na dish-pan.\r\n\r\nThe fire fought a losing battle, and at last died away, while the frost\r\npenetrated the mossy chinks between the logs and chilled the inner\r\natmosphere.  The dogs outside ceased their howling, and, curled up in the\r\nsnow, dreamed of salmon-stocked heavens where dog-drivers and kindred\r\ntask-masters were not.  Within, the sailor lay like a log, while his host\r\ntossed restlessly about, the victim of strange fantasies.  As midnight\r\ndrew near he suddenly threw off the blankets and got up.  It was\r\nremarkable that he could do what he then did without ever striking a\r\nlight.  Perhaps it was because of the darkness that he kept his eyes\r\nshut, and perhaps it was for fear he would see the terrible gash on the\r\ncheek of his visitor; but, be this as it may, it is a fact that,\r\nunseeing, he opened his ammunition box, put a heavy charge into the\r\nmuzzle of the shotgun without spilling a particle, rammed it down with\r\ndouble wads, and then put everything away and got back into bed.\r\n\r\nJust as daylight laid its steel-gray fingers on the parchment window,\r\nJacob Kent awoke.  Turning on his elbow, he raised the lid and peered\r\ninto the ammunition box.  Whatever he saw, or whatever he did not see,\r\nexercised a very peculiar effect upon him, considering his neurotic\r\ntemperament.  He glanced at the sleeping man on the floor, let the lid\r\ndown gently, and rolled over on his back.  It was an unwonted calm that\r\nrested on his face.  Not a muscle quivered.  There was not the least sign\r\nof excitement or perturbation.  He lay there a long while, thinking, and\r\nwhen he got up and began to move about, it was in a cool, collected\r\nmanner, without noise and without hurry.\r\n\r\nIt happened that a heavy wooden peg had been driven into the ridge-pole\r\njust above Jim Cardegee\'s head.  Jacob Kent, working softly, ran a piece\r\nof half-inch manila over it, bringing both ends to the ground.  One end\r\nhe tied about his waist, and in the other he rove a running noose.  Then\r\nhe cocked his shotgun and laid it within reach, by the side of numerous\r\nmoose-hide thongs.  By an effort of will he bore the sight of the scar,\r\nslipped the noose over the sleeper\'s head, and drew it taut by throwing\r\nback on his weight, at the same time seizing the gun and bringing it to\r\nbear.\r\n\r\nJim Cardegee awoke, choking, bewildered, staring down the twin wells of\r\nsteel.\r\n\r\n"Where is it?" Kent asked, at the same time slacking on the rope.\r\n\r\n"You blasted--ugh--"\r\n\r\nKent merely threw back his weight, shutting off the other\'s wind.\r\n\r\n"Bloomin\'--Bur--ugh--"\r\n\r\n"Where is it?" Kent repeated.\r\n\r\n"Wot?"  Cardegee asked, as soon as he had caught his breath.\r\n\r\n"The gold-dust."\r\n\r\n"Wot gold-dust?" the perplexed sailor demanded.\r\n\r\n"You know well enough,--mine."\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t seen nothink of it.  Wot do ye take me for?  A safe-deposit?  Wot\r\n\'ave I got to do with it, any\'ow?"\r\n\r\n"Mebbe you know, and mebbe you don\'t know, but anyway, I\'m going to stop\r\nyour breath till you do know.  And if you lift a hand, I\'ll blow your\r\nhead off!"\r\n\r\n"Vast heavin\'!" Cardegee roared, as the rope tightened.\r\n\r\nKent eased away a moment, and the sailor, wriggling his neck as though\r\nfrom the pressure, managed to loosen the noose a bit and work it up so\r\nthe point of contact was just under the chin.\r\n\r\n"Well?" Kent questioned, expecting the disclosure.\r\n\r\nBut Cardegee grinned.  "Go ahead with your \'angin\', you bloomin\' old pot-\r\nwolloper!"\r\n\r\nThen, as the sailor had anticipated, the tragedy became a farce.  Cardegee\r\nbeing the heavier of the two, Kent, throwing his body backward and down,\r\ncould not lift him clear of the ground.  Strain and strive to the\r\nuttermost, the sailor\'s feet still stuck to the floor and sustained a\r\npart of his weight.  The remaining portion was supported by the point of\r\ncontact just under his chin.  Failing to swing him clear, Kent clung on,\r\nresolved to slowly throttle him or force him to tell what he had done\r\nwith the hoard.  But the Man with the Gash would not throttle.  Five,\r\nten, fifteen minutes passed, and at the end of that time, in despair,\r\nKent let his prisoner down.\r\n\r\n"Well," he remarked, wiping away the sweat, "if you won\'t hang you\'ll\r\nshoot.  Some men wasn\'t born to be hanged, anyway."\r\n\r\n"An\' it\'s a pretty mess as you\'ll make o\' this \'ere cabin floor."\r\nCardegee was fighting for time.  "Now, look \'ere, I\'ll tell you wot we\r\ndo; we\'ll lay our \'eads \'longside an\' reason together.  You\'ve lost some\r\ndust.  You say as \'ow I know, an\' I say as \'ow I don\'t.  Let\'s get a\r\nhobservation an\' shape a course--"\r\n\r\n"Vast heavin\'!"  Kent dashed in, maliciously imitating the other\'s\r\nenunciation.  "I\'m going to shape all the courses of this shebang, and\r\nyou observe; and if you do anything more, I\'ll bore you as sure as\r\nMoses!"\r\n\r\n"For the sake of my mother--"\r\n\r\n"Whom God have mercy upon if she loves you.  Ah!  Would you?"  He\r\nfrustrated a hostile move on the part of the other by pressing the cold\r\nmuzzle against his forehead.  "Lay quiet, now!  If you lift as much as a\r\nhair, you\'ll get it."\r\n\r\nIt was rather an awkward task, with the trigger of the gun always within\r\npulling distance of the finger; but Kent was a weaver, and in a few\r\nminutes had the sailor tied hand and foot.  Then he dragged him without\r\nand laid him by the side of the cabin, where he could overlook the river\r\nand watch the sun climb to the meridian.\r\n\r\n"Now I\'ll give you till noon, and then--"\r\n\r\n"Wot?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be hitting the brimstone trail.  But if you speak up, I\'ll keep\r\nyou till the next bunch of mounted police come by."\r\n\r\n"Well, Gawd blime me, if this ain\'t a go!  \'Ere I be, innercent as a\r\nlamb, an\' \'ere you be, lost all o\' your top \'amper an\' out o\' your\r\nreckonin\', run me foul an\' goin\' to rake me into \'ell-fire.  You bloomin\'\r\nold pirut!  You--"\r\n\r\nJim Cardegee loosed the strings of his profanity and fairly outdid\r\nhimself.  Jacob Kent brought out a stool that he might enjoy it in\r\ncomfort.  Having exhausted all the possible combinations of his\r\nvocabulary, the sailor quieted down to hard thinking, his eyes constantly\r\ngauging the progress of the sun, which tore up the eastern slope of the\r\nheavens with unseemly haste.  His dogs, surprised that they had not long\r\nsince been put to harness, crowded around him.  His helplessness appealed\r\nto the brutes.  They felt that something was wrong, though they knew not\r\nwhat, and they crowded about, howling their mournful sympathy.\r\n\r\n"Chook!  Mush-on! you Siwashes!" he cried, attempting, in a vermicular\r\nway, to kick at them, and discovering himself to be tottering on the edge\r\nof a declivity.  As soon as the animals had scattered, he devoted himself\r\nto the significance of that declivity which he felt to be there but could\r\nnot see.  Nor was he long in arriving at a correct conclusion.  In the\r\nnature of things, he figured, man is lazy.  He does no more than he has\r\nto.  When he builds a cabin he must put dirt on the roof.  From these\r\npremises it was logical that he should carry that dirt no further than\r\nwas absolutely necessary.  Therefore, he lay upon the edge of the hole\r\nfrom which the dirt had been taken to roof Jacob Kent\'s cabin.  This\r\nknowledge, properly utilized, might prolong things, he thought; and he\r\nthen turned his attention to the moose-hide thongs which bound him.  His\r\nhands were tied behind him, and pressing against the snow, they were wet\r\nwith the contact.  This moistening of the raw-hide he knew would tend to\r\nmake it stretch, and, without apparent effort, he endeavored to stretch\r\nit more and more.\r\n\r\nHe watched the trail hungrily, and when in the direction of Sixty Mile a\r\ndark speck appeared for a moment against the white background of an ice-\r\njam, he cast an anxious eye at the sun.  It had climbed nearly to the\r\nzenith.  Now and again he caught the black speck clearing the hills of\r\nice and sinking into the intervening hollows; but he dared not permit\r\nhimself more than the most cursory glances for fear of rousing his\r\nenemy\'s suspicion.  Once, when Jacob Kent rose to his feet and searched\r\nthe trail with care, Cardegee was frightened, but the dog-sled had struck\r\na piece of trail running parallel with a jam, and remained out of sight\r\ntill the danger was past.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll see you \'ung for this," Cardegee threatened, attempting to draw the\r\nother\'s attention.  "An\' you\'ll rot in \'ell, jes\' you see if you don\'t.\r\n\r\n"I say," he cried, after another pause; "d\'ye b\'lieve in ghosts?"  Kent\'s\r\nsudden start made him sure of his ground, and he went on: "Now a ghost\r\n\'as the right to \'aunt a man wot don\'t do wot he says; and you can\'t\r\nshuffle me off till eight bells--wot I mean is twelve o\'clock--can you?\r\n\'Cos if you do, it\'ll \'appen as \'ow I\'ll \'aunt you.  D\'ye \'ear?  A\r\nminute, a second too quick, an\' I\'ll \'aunt you, so \'elp me, I will!"\r\n\r\nJacob Kent looked dubious, but declined to talk.\r\n\r\n"\'Ow\'s your chronometer?  Wot\'s your longitude?  \'Ow do you know as your\r\ntime\'s correct?" Cardegee persisted, vainly hoping to beat his\r\nexecutioner out of a few minutes.  "Is it Barrack\'s time you \'ave, or is\r\nit the Company time?  \'Cos if you do it before the stroke o\' the bell,\r\nI\'ll not rest.  I give you fair warnin\'.  I\'ll come back.  An\' if you\r\n\'aven\'t the time, \'ow will you know?  That\'s wot I want--\'ow will you\r\ntell?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll send you off all right," Kent replied.  "Got a sun-dial here."\r\n\r\n"No good.  Thirty-two degrees variation o\' the needle."\r\n\r\n"Stakes are all set."\r\n\r\n"\'Ow did you set \'em?  Compass?"\r\n\r\n"No; lined them up with the North Star."\r\n\r\n"Sure?"\r\n\r\n"Sure."\r\n\r\nCardegee groaned, then stole a glance at the trail.  The sled was just\r\nclearing a rise, barely a mile away, and the dogs were in full lope,\r\nrunning lightly.\r\n\r\n"\'Ow close is the shadows to the line?"\r\n\r\nKent walked to the primitive timepiece and studied it.  "Three inches,"\r\nhe announced, after a careful survey.\r\n\r\n"Say, jes\' sing out \'eight bells\' afore you pull the gun, will you?"\r\n\r\nKent agreed, and they lapsed into silence.  The thongs about Cardegee\'s\r\nwrists were slowly stretching, and he had begun to work them over his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n"Say, \'ow close is the shadows?"\r\n\r\n"One inch."\r\n\r\nThe sailor wriggled slightly to assure himself that he would topple over\r\nat the right moment, and slipped the first turn over his hands.\r\n\r\n"\'Ow close?"\r\n\r\n"Half an inch."  Just then Kent heard the jarring churn of the runners\r\nand turned his eyes to the trail.  The driver was lying flat on the sled\r\nand the dogs swinging down the straight stretch to the cabin.  Kent\r\nwhirled back, bringing his rifle to shoulder.\r\n\r\n"It ain\'t eight bells yet!" Cardegee expostulated.  "I\'ll \'aunt you,\r\nsure!"\r\n\r\nJacob Kent faltered.  He was standing by the sun-dial, perhaps ten paces\r\nfrom his victim.  The man on the sled must have seen that something\r\nunusual was taking place, for he had risen to his knees, his whip singing\r\nviciously among the dogs.\r\n\r\nThe shadows swept into line.  Kent looked along the sights.\r\n\r\n"Make ready!" he commanded solemnly.  "Eight b--"\r\n\r\nBut just a fraction of a second too soon, Cardegee rolled backward into\r\nthe hole.  Kent held his fire and ran to the edge.  Bang!  The gun\r\nexploded full in the sailor\'s face as he rose to his feet.  But no smoke\r\ncame from the muzzle; instead, a sheet of flame burst from the side of\r\nthe barrel near its butt, and Jacob Kent went down.  The dogs dashed up\r\nthe bank, dragging the sled over his body, and the driver sprang off as\r\nJim Cardegee freed his hands and drew himself from the hole.\r\n\r\n"Jim!"  The new-comer recognized him.  "What\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Wot\'s the matter?  Oh, nothink at all.  It jest \'appens as I do little\r\nthings like this for my \'ealth.  Wot\'s the matter, you bloomin\' idjit?\r\nWot\'s the matter, eh?  Cast me loose or I\'ll show you wot!  \'Urry up, or\r\nI\'ll \'olystone the decks with you!"\r\n\r\n"Huh!" he added, as the other went to work with his sheath-knife.  "Wot\'s\r\nthe matter?  I want to know.  Jes\' tell me that, will you, wot\'s the\r\nmatter?  Hey?"\r\n\r\nKent was quite dead when they rolled him over.  The gun, an\r\nold-fashioned, heavy-weighted muzzle-loader, lay near him.  Steel and\r\nwood had parted company.  Near the butt of the right-hand barrel, with\r\nlips pressed outward, gaped a fissure several inches in length.  The\r\nsailor picked it up, curiously.  A glittering stream of yellow dust ran\r\nout through the crack.  The facts of the case dawned upon Jim Cardegee.\r\n\r\n"Strike me standin\'!" he roared; "\'ere\'s a go!  \'Ere\'s \'is bloomin\' dust!\r\nGawd blime me, an\' you, too, Charley, if you don\'t run an\' get the dish-\r\npan!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAN, THE UNREPENTANT\r\n\r\n\r\n   "For there\'s never a law of God or man\r\n   Runs north of Fifty-three."\r\n\r\nJan rolled over, clawing and kicking.  He was fighting hand and foot now,\r\nand he fought grimly, silently.  Two of the three men who hung upon him,\r\nshouted directions to each other, and strove to curb the short, hairy\r\ndevil who would not curb.  The third man howled.  His finger was between\r\nJan\'s teeth.\r\n\r\n"Quit yer tantrums, Jan, an\' ease up!" panted Red Bill, getting a\r\nstrangle-hold on Jan\'s neck.  "Why on earth can\'t yeh hang decent and\r\npeaceable?"\r\n\r\nBut Jan kept his grip on the third man\'s finger, and squirmed over the\r\nfloor of the tent, into the pots and pans.\r\n\r\n"Youah no gentleman, suh," reproved Mr. Taylor, his body following his\r\nfinger, and endeavoring to accommodate itself to every jerk of Jan\'s\r\nhead.  "You hev killed Mistah Gordon, as brave and honorable a gentleman\r\nas ever hit the trail aftah the dogs.  Youah a murderah, suh, and without\r\nhonah."\r\n\r\n"An\' yer no comrade," broke in Red Bill.  "If you was, you\'d hang \'thout\r\nrampin\' around an\' roarin\'.  Come on, Jan, there\'s a good fellow.  Don\'t\r\ngive us no more trouble.  Jes\' quit, an\' we\'ll hang yeh neat and handy,\r\nan\' be done with it."\r\n\r\n"Steady, all!" Lawson, the sailorman, bawled.  "Jam his head into the\r\nbean pot and batten down."\r\n\r\n"But my fingah, suh," Mr. Taylor protested.\r\n\r\n"Leggo with y\'r finger, then!  Always in the way!"\r\n\r\n"But I can\'t, Mistah Lawson.  It\'s in the critter\'s gullet, and nigh\r\nchewed off as \'t is."\r\n\r\n"Stand by for stays!"  As Lawson gave the warning, Jan half lifted\r\nhimself, and the struggling quartet floundered across the tent into a\r\nmuddle of furs and blankets.  In its passage it cleared the body of a\r\nman, who lay motionless, bleeding from a bullet-wound in the neck.\r\n\r\nAll this was because of the madness which had come upon Jan--the madness\r\nwhich comes upon a man who has stripped off the raw skin of earth and\r\ngrovelled long in primal nakedness, and before whose eyes rises the fat\r\nvales of the homeland, and into whose nostrils steals the whiff of bay,\r\nand grass, and flower, and new-turned soil.  Through five frigid years\r\nJan had sown the seed.  Stuart River, Forty Mile, Circle City, Koyokuk,\r\nKotzebue, had marked his bleak and strenuous agriculture, and now it was\r\nNome that bore the harvest,--not the Nome of golden beaches and ruby\r\nsands, but the Nome of \'97, before Anvil City was located, or Eldorado\r\nDistrict organized.  John Gordon was a Yankee, and should have known\r\nbetter.  But he passed the sharp word at a time when Jan\'s blood-shot\r\neyes blazed and his teeth gritted in torment.  And because of this, there\r\nwas a smell of saltpetre in the tent, and one lay quietly, while the\r\nother fought like a cornered rat, and refused to hang in the decent and\r\npeacable manner suggested by his comrades.\r\n\r\n"If you will allow me, Mistah Lawson, befoah we go further in this\r\nrumpus, I would say it wah a good idea to pry this hyer varmint\'s teeth\r\napart.  Neither will he bite off, nor will he let go.  He has the wisdom\r\nof the sarpint, suh, the wisdom of the sarpint."\r\n\r\n"Lemme get the hatchet to him!" vociferated the sailor.  "Lemme get the\r\nhatchet!"  He shoved the steel edge close to Mr. Taylor\'s finger and used\r\nthe man\'s teeth as a fulcrum.  Jan held on and breathed through his nose,\r\nsnorting like a grampus.  "Steady, all!  Now she takes it!"\r\n\r\n"Thank you, suh; it is a powerful relief."  And Mr. Taylor proceeded to\r\ngather into his arms the victim\'s wildly waving legs.\r\n\r\nBut Jan upreared in his Berserker rage; bleeding, frothing, cursing; five\r\nfrozen years thawing into sudden hell.  They swayed backward and forward,\r\npanted, sweated, like some cyclopean, many-legged monster rising from the\r\nlower deeps.  The slush-lamp went over, drowned in its own fat, while the\r\nmidday twilight scarce percolated through the dirty canvas of the tent.\r\n\r\n"For the love of Gawd, Jan, get yer senses back!" pleaded Red Bill.  "We\r\nain\'t goin\' to hurt yeh, \'r kill yeh, \'r anythin\' of that sort.  Jes\'\r\nwant to hang yeh, that\'s all, an\' you a-messin\' round an\' rampagin\'\r\nsomethin\' terrible.  To think of travellin\' trail together an\' then bein\'\r\ntreated this-a way.  Wouldn\'t \'bleeved it of yeh, Jan!"\r\n\r\n"He\'s got too much steerage-way.  Grab holt his legs, Taylor, and heave\'m\r\nover!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, suh, Mistah Lawson.  Do you press youah weight above, after I give\r\nthe word."  The Kentuckian groped about him in the murky darkness.  "Now,\r\nsuh, now is the accepted time!"\r\n\r\nThere was a great surge, and a quarter of a ton of human flesh tottered\r\nand crashed to its fall against the side-wall.  Pegs drew and guy-ropes\r\nparted, and the tent, collapsing, wrapped the battle in its greasy folds.\r\n\r\n"Yer only makin\' it harder fer yerself," Red Bill continued, at the same\r\ntime driving both his thumbs into a hairy throat, the possessor of which\r\nhe had pinned down.  "You\'ve made nuisance enough a\' ready, an\' it\'ll\r\ntake half the day to get things straightened when we\'ve strung yeh up."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll thank you to leave go, suh," spluttered Mr. Taylor.\r\n\r\nRed Bill grunted and loosed his grip, and the twain crawled out into the\r\nopen.  At the same instant Jan kicked clear of the sailor, and took to\r\nhis heels across the snow.\r\n\r\n"Hi! you lazy devils!  Buck!  Bright!  Sic\'m!  Pull \'m down!" sang out\r\nLawson, lunging through the snow after the fleeing man.  Buck and Bright,\r\nfollowed by the rest of the dogs, outstripped him and rapidly overhauled\r\nthe murderer.\r\n\r\nThere was no reason that these men should do this; no reason for Jan to\r\nrun away; no reason for them to attempt to prevent him.  On the one hand\r\nstretched the barren snow-land; on the other, the frozen sea.  With\r\nneither food nor shelter, he could not run far.  All they had to do was\r\nto wait till he wandered back to the tent, as he inevitably must, when\r\nthe frost and hunger laid hold of him.  But these men did not stop to\r\nthink.  There was a certain taint of madness running in the veins of all\r\nof them.  Besides, blood had been spilled, and upon them was the blood-\r\nlust, thick and hot.  "Vengeance is mine," saith the Lord, and He saith\r\nit in temperate climes where the warm sun steals away the energies of\r\nmen.  But in the Northland they have discovered that prayer is only\r\nefficacious when backed by muscle, and they are accustomed to doing\r\nthings for themselves.  God is everywhere, they have heard, but he flings\r\na shadow over the land for half the year that they may not find him; so\r\nthey grope in darkness, and it is not to be wondered that they often\r\ndoubt, and deem the Decalogue out of gear.\r\n\r\nJan ran blindly, reckoning not of the way of his feet, for he was\r\nmastered by the verb "to live."  To live!  To exist!  Buck flashed gray\r\nthrough the air, but missed.  The man struck madly at him, and stumbled.\r\nThen the white teeth of Bright closed on his mackinaw jacket, and he\r\npitched into the snow.  _To live_!  _To exist_!  He fought wildly as\r\never, the centre of a tossing heap of men and dogs.  His left hand\r\ngripped a wolf-dog by the scruff of the back, while the arm was passed\r\naround the neck of Lawson.  Every struggle of the dog helped to throttle\r\nthe hapless sailor.  Jan\'s right hand was buried deep in the curling\r\ntendrils of Red Bill\'s shaggy head, and beneath all, Mr. Taylor lay\r\npinned and helpless.  It was a deadlock, for the strength of his madness\r\nwas prodigious; but suddenly, without apparent reason, Jan loosed his\r\nvarious grips and rolled over quietly on his back.  His adversaries drew\r\naway a little, dubious and disconcerted.  Jan grinned viciously.\r\n\r\n"Mine friends," he said, still grinning, "you haf asked me to be\r\npoliteful, und now I am politeful.  Vot piziness vood you do mit me?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, Jan.  Be ca\'m," soothed Red Bill.  "I knowed you\'d come to\r\nyer senses afore long.  Jes\' be ca\'m now, an\' we\'ll do the trick with\r\nneatness and despatch."\r\n\r\n"Vot piziness?  Vot trick?"\r\n\r\n"The hangin\'.  An\' yeh oughter thank yer lucky stars for havin\' a man\r\nwhat knows his business.  I\'ve did it afore now, more\'n once, down in the\r\nStates, an\' I can do it to a T."\r\n\r\n"Hang who?  Me?"\r\n\r\n"Yep."\r\n\r\n"Ha! ha!  Shust hear der man speak foolishness!  Gif me a hand, Bill, und\r\nI vill get up und be hung."  He crawled stiffly to his feet and looked\r\nabout him.  "Herr Gott! listen to der man!  He vood hang me!  Ho! ho! ho!\r\nI tank not!  Yes, I tank not!"\r\n\r\n"And I tank yes, you swab," Lawson spoke up mockingly, at the same time\r\ncutting a sled-lashing and coiling it up with ominous care.  "Judge Lynch\r\nholds court this day."\r\n\r\n"Von liddle while."  Jan stepped back from the proffered noose.  "I haf\r\nsomedings to ask und to make der great proposition.  Kentucky, you know\r\nabout der Shudge Lynch?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, suh.  It is an institution of free men and of gentlemen, and it is\r\nan ole one and time-honored.  Corruption may wear the robe of magistracy,\r\nsuh, but Judge Lynch can always be relied upon to give justice without\r\ncourt fees.  I repeat, suh, without court fees.  Law may be bought and\r\nsold, but in this enlightened land justice is free as the air we breathe,\r\nstrong as the licker we drink, prompt as--"\r\n\r\n"Cut it short!  Find out what the beggar wants," interrupted Lawson,\r\nspoiling the peroration.\r\n\r\n"Vell, Kentucky, tell me dis: von man kill von odder man, Shudge Lynch\r\nhang dot man?"\r\n\r\n"If the evidence is strong enough--yes, suh."\r\n\r\n"An\' the evidence in this here case is strong enough to hang a dozen men,\r\nJan," broke in Red Bill.\r\n\r\n"Nefer you mind, Bill.  I talk mit you next.  Now von anodder ding I ask\r\nKentucky.  If Shudge Lynch hang not der man, vot den?"\r\n\r\n"If Judge Lynch does not hang the man, then the man goes free, and his\r\nhands are washed clean of blood.  And further, suh, our great and\r\nglorious constitution has said, to wit: that no man may twice be placed\r\nin jeopardy of his life for one and the same crime, or words to that\r\neffect."\r\n\r\n"Unt dey can\'t shoot him, or hit him mit a club over der head alongside,\r\nor do nodings more mit him?"\r\n\r\n"No, suh."\r\n\r\n"Goot!  You hear vot Kentucky speaks, all you noddleheads?  Now I talk\r\nmit Bill.  You know der piziness, Bill, und you hang me up brown, eh?  Vot\r\nyou say?"\r\n\r\n"\'Betcher life, an\', Jan, if yeh don\'t give no more trouble ye\'ll be\r\nalmighty proud of the job.  I\'m a connesoor."\r\n\r\n"You haf der great head, Bill, und know somedings or two.  Und you know\r\ntwo und one makes tree--ain\'t it?"\r\n\r\nBill nodded.\r\n\r\n"Und when you haf two dings, you haf not tree dings--ain\'t it?  Now you\r\nfollow mit me close und I show you.  It takes tree dings to hang.  First\r\nding, you haf to haf der man.  Goot!  I am der man.  Second ding, you haf\r\nto haf der rope.  Lawson haf der rope.  Goot!  Und tird ding, you haf to\r\nhaf someding to tie der rope to.  Sling your eyes over der landscape und\r\nfind der tird ding to tie der rope to?  Eh?  Vot you say?"\r\n\r\nMechanically they swept the ice and snow with their eyes.  It was a\r\nhomogeneous scene, devoid of contrasts or bold contours, dreary,\r\ndesolate, and monotonous,--the ice-packed sea, the slow slope of the\r\nbeach, the background of low-lying hills, and over all thrown the endless\r\nmantle of snow.  "No trees, no bluffs, no cabins, no telegraph poles,\r\nnothin\'," moaned Red Bill; "nothin\' respectable enough nor big enough to\r\nswing the toes of a five-foot man clear o\' the ground.  I give it up."  He\r\nlooked yearningly at that portion of Jan\'s anatomy which joins the head\r\nand shoulders.  "Give it up," he repeated sadly to Lawson.  "Throw the\r\nrope down.  Gawd never intended this here country for livin\' purposes,\r\nan\' that\'s a cold frozen fact."\r\n\r\nJan grinned triumphantly.  "I tank I go mit der tent und haf a smoke."\r\n\r\n"Ostensiblee y\'r correct, Bill, me son," spoke up Lawson; "but y\'r a\r\ndummy, and you can lay to that for another cold frozen fact.  Takes a sea\r\nfarmer to learn you landsmen things.  Ever hear of a pair of shears?  Then\r\nclap y\'r eyes to this."\r\n\r\nThe sailor worked rapidly.  From the pile of dunnage where they had\r\npulled up the boat the preceding fall, he unearthed a pair of long oars.\r\nThese he lashed together, at nearly right angles, close to the ends of\r\nthe blades.  Where the handles rested he kicked holes through the snow to\r\nthe sand.  At the point of intersection he attached two guy-ropes, making\r\nthe end of one fast to a cake of beach-ice.  The other guy he passed over\r\nto Red Bill.  "Here, me son, lay holt o\' that and run it out."\r\n\r\nAnd to his horror, Jan saw his gallows rise in the air.  "No! no!" he\r\ncried, recoiling and putting up his fists.  "It is not goot!  I vill not\r\nhang!  Come, you noddleheads!  I vill lick you, all together, von after\r\nder odder!  I vill blay hell!  I vill do eferydings!  Und I vill die\r\npefore I hang!"\r\n\r\nThe sailor permitted the two other men to clinch with the mad creature.\r\nThey rolled and tossed about furiously, tearing up snow and tundra, their\r\nfierce struggle writing a tragedy of human passion on the white sheet\r\nspread by nature.  And ever and anon a hand or foot of Jan emerged from\r\nthe tangle, to be gripped by Lawson and lashed fast with rope-yarns.\r\nPawing, clawing, blaspheming, he was conquered and bound, inch by inch,\r\nand drawn to where the inexorable shears lay like a pair of gigantic\r\ndividers on the snow.  Red Bill adjusted the noose, placing the hangman\'s\r\nknot properly under the left ear.  Mr. Taylor and Lawson tailed onto the\r\nrunning-guy, ready at the word to elevate the gallows.  Bill lingered,\r\ncontemplating his work with artistic appreciation.\r\n\r\n"Herr Gott!  Vood you look at it!"\r\n\r\nThe horror in Jan\'s voice caused the rest to desist.  The fallen tent had\r\nuprisen, and in the gathering twilight it flapped ghostly arms about and\r\ntitubated toward them drunkenly.  But the next instant John Gordon found\r\nthe opening and crawled forth.\r\n\r\n"What the flaming--!"  For the moment his voice died away in his throat\r\nas his eyes took in the tableau.  "Hold on!  I\'m not dead!" he cried out,\r\ncoming up to the group with stormy countenance.\r\n\r\n"Allow me, Mistah Gordon, to congratulate you upon youah escape," Mr.\r\nTaylor ventured.  "A close shave, suh, a powahful close shave."\r\n\r\n" Congratulate hell!  I might have been dead and rotten and no thanks to\r\nyou, you--!"  And thereat John Gordon delivered himself of a vigorous\r\nflood of English, terse, intensive, denunciative, and composed solely of\r\nexpletives and adjectives.\r\n\r\n"Simply creased me," he went on when he had eased himself sufficiently.\r\n"Ever crease cattle, Taylor?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, suh, many a time down in God\'s country."\r\n\r\n"Just so.  That\'s what happened to me.  Bullet just grazed the base of my\r\nskull at the top of the neck.  Stunned me but no harm done."  He turned\r\nto the bound man.  "Get up, Jan.  I\'m going to lick you to a standstill\r\nor you\'re going to apologize.  The rest of you lads stand clear."\r\n\r\n"I tank not.  Shust tie me loose und you see," replied Jan, the\r\nUnrepentant, the devil within him still unconquered.  "Und after as I\r\nlick you, I take der rest of der noddleheads, von after der odder,\r\naltogedder!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIT OF WOMEN\r\n\r\n\r\nA wolfish head, wistful-eyed and frost-rimed, thrust aside the\r\ntent-flaps.\r\n\r\n"Hi!  Chook!  Siwash!  Chook, you limb of Satan!" chorused the protesting\r\ninmates.  Bettles rapped the dog sharply with a tin plate, and it\r\nwithdrew hastily.  Louis Savoy refastened the flaps, kicked a frying-pan\r\nover against the bottom, and warmed his hands.  It was very cold without.\r\nForty-eight hours gone, the spirit thermometer had burst at sixty-eight\r\nbelow, and since that time it had grown steadily and bitterly colder.\r\nThere was no telling when the snap would end.  And it is poor policy,\r\nunless the gods will it, to venture far from a stove at such times, or to\r\nincrease the quantity of cold atmosphere one must breathe.  Men sometimes\r\ndo it, and sometimes they chill their lungs.  This leads up to a dry,\r\nhacking cough, noticeably irritable when bacon is being fried.  After\r\nthat, somewhere along in the spring or summer, a hole is burned in the\r\nfrozen muck.  Into this a man\'s carcass is dumped, covered over with\r\nmoss, and left with the assurance that it will rise on the crack of Doom,\r\nwholly and frigidly intact.  For those of little faith, sceptical of\r\nmaterial integration on that fateful day, no fitter country than the\r\nKlondike can be recommended to die in.  But it is not to be inferred from\r\nthis that it is a fit country for living purposes.\r\n\r\nIt was very cold without, but it was not over-warm within.  The only\r\narticle which might be designated furniture was the stove, and for this\r\nthe men were frank in displaying their preference.  Upon half of the\r\nfloor pine boughs had been cast; above this were spread the\r\nsleeping-furs, beneath lay the winter\'s snowfall.  The remainder of the\r\nfloor was moccasin-packed snow, littered with pots and pans and the\r\ngeneral _impedimenta_ of an Arctic camp.  The stove was red and roaring\r\nhot, but only a bare three feet away lay a block of ice, as sharp-edged\r\nand dry as when first quarried from the creek bottom.  The pressure of\r\nthe outside cold forced the inner heat upward.  Just above the stove,\r\nwhere the pipe penetrated the roof, was a tiny circle of dry canvas;\r\nnext, with the pipe always as centre, a circle of steaming canvas; next a\r\ndamp and moisture-exuding ring; and finally, the rest of the tent,\r\nsidewalls and top, coated with a half-inch of dry, white,\r\ncrystal-encrusted frost.\r\n\r\n"_Oh_!  OH!  OH!"  A young fellow, lying asleep in the furs, bearded and\r\nwan and weary, raised a moan of pain, and without waking increased the\r\npitch and intensity of his anguish.  His body half-lifted from the\r\nblankets, and quivered and shrank spasmodically, as though drawing away\r\nfrom a bed of nettles.\r\n\r\n"Roll\'m over!" ordered Bettles.  "He\'s crampin\'."\r\n\r\nAnd thereat, with pitiless good-will, he was pitched upon and rolled and\r\nthumped and pounded by half-a-dozen willing comrades.\r\n\r\n"Damn the trail," he muttered softly, as he threw off the robes and sat\r\nup.  "I\'ve run across country, played quarter three seasons hand-running,\r\nand hardened myself in all manner of ways; and then I pilgrim it into\r\nthis God-forsaken land and find myself an effeminate Athenian without the\r\nsimplest rudiments of manhood!"  He hunched up to the fire and rolled a\r\ncigarette.  "Oh, I\'m not whining.  I can take my medicine all right, all\r\nright; but I\'m just decently ashamed of myself, that\'s all.  Here I am,\r\non top of a dirty thirty miles, as knocked up and stiff and sore as a\r\npink-tea degenerate after a five-mile walk on a country turn-pike.  Bah!\r\nIt makes me sick!  Got a match?"  "Don\'t git the tantrums, youngster."\r\nBettles passed over the required fire-stick and waxed patriarchal.  "Ye\'ve\r\ngotter \'low some for the breakin\'-in.  Sufferin\' cracky! don\'t I\r\nrecollect the first time I hit the trail!  Stiff?  I\'ve seen the time\r\nit\'d take me ten minutes to git my mouth from the water-hole an\' come to\r\nmy feet--every jint crackin\' an\' kickin\' fit to kill.  Cramp?  In sech\r\nknots it\'d take the camp half a day to untangle me.  You\'re all right,\r\nfor a cub, any ye\'ve the true sperrit.  Come this day year, you\'ll walk\r\nall us old bucks into the ground any time.  An\' best in your favor, you\r\nhain\'t got that streak of fat in your make-up which has sent many a husky\r\nman to the bosom of Abraham afore his right and proper time."\r\n\r\n"Streak of fat?"\r\n\r\n"Yep.  Comes along of bulk.  \'T ain\'t the big men as is the best when it\r\ncomes to the trail."\r\n\r\n"Never heard of it."\r\n\r\n"Never heered of it, eh?  Well, it\'s a dead straight, open-an\'-shut fact,\r\nan\' no gittin\' round.  Bulk\'s all well enough for a mighty big effort,\r\nbut \'thout stayin\' powers it ain\'t worth a continental whoop; an\' stayin\'\r\npowers an\' bulk ain\'t runnin\' mates.  Takes the small, wiry fellows when\r\nit comes to gittin\' right down an\' hangin\' on like a lean-jowled dog to a\r\nbone.  Why, hell\'s fire, the big men they ain\'t in it!"\r\n\r\n"By gar!" broke in Louis Savoy, "dat is no, vot you call, josh!  I know\r\none mans, so vaire beeg like ze buffalo.  Wit him, on ze Sulphur Creek\r\nstampede, go one small mans, Lon McFane.  You know dat Lon McFane, dat\r\nleetle Irisher wit ze red hair and ze grin.  An\' dey walk an\' walk an\'\r\nwalk, all ze day long an\' ze night long.  And beeg mans, him become vaire\r\ntired, an\' lay down mooch in ze snow.  And leetle mans keek beeg mans,\r\nan\' him cry like, vot you call--ah! vot you call ze kid.  And leetle mans\r\nkeek an\' keek an\' keek, an\' bime by, long time, long way, keek beeg mans\r\ninto my cabin.  Tree days \'fore him crawl out my blankets.  Nevaire I see\r\nbeeg squaw like him.  No nevaire.  Him haf vot you call ze streak of fat.\r\nYou bet."\r\n\r\n"But there was Axel Gunderson," Prince spoke up.  The great Scandinavian,\r\nwith the tragic events which shadowed his passing, had made a deep mark\r\non the mining engineer.  "He lies up there, somewhere."  He swept his\r\nhand in the vague direction of the mysterious east.\r\n\r\n"Biggest man that ever turned his heels to Salt Water, or run a moose\r\ndown with sheer grit," supplemented Bettles; "but he\'s the prove-the-rule\r\nexception.  Look at his woman, Unga,--tip the scales at a hundred an\'\r\nten, clean meat an\' nary ounce to spare.  She\'d bank grit \'gainst his for\r\nall there was in him, an\' see him, an\' go him better if it was possible.\r\nNothing over the earth, or in it, or under it, she wouldn\'t \'a\' done."\r\n\r\n"But she loved him," objected the engineer.\r\n\r\n"\'T ain\'t that.  It--"\r\n\r\n"Look you, brothers," broke in Sitka Charley from his seat on the grub-\r\nbox.  "Ye have spoken of the streak of fat that runs in big men\'s\r\nmuscles, of the grit of women and the love, and ye have spoken fair; but\r\nI have in mind things which happened when the land was young and the\r\nfires of men apart as the stars.  It was then I had concern with a big\r\nman, and a streak of fat, and a woman.  And the woman was small; but her\r\nheart was greater than the beef-heart of the man, and she had grit.  And\r\nwe traveled a weary trail, even to the Salt Water, and the cold was\r\nbitter, the snow deep, the hunger great.  And the woman\'s love was a\r\nmighty love--no more can man say than this."\r\n\r\nHe paused, and with the hatchet broke pieces of ice from the large chunk\r\nbeside him.  These he threw into the gold pan on the stove, where the\r\ndrinking-water thawed.  The men drew up closer, and he of the cramps\r\nsought greater comfort vainly for his stiffened body.\r\n\r\n"Brothers, my blood is red with Siwash, but my heart is white.  To the\r\nfaults of my fathers I owe the one, to the virtues of my friends the\r\nother.  A great truth came to me when I was yet a boy.  I learned that to\r\nyour kind and you was given the earth; that the Siwash could not\r\nwithstand you, and like the caribou and the bear, must perish in the\r\ncold.  So I came into the warm and sat among you, by your fires, and\r\nbehold, I became one of you, I have seen much in my time.  I have known\r\nstrange things, and bucked big, on big trails, with men of many breeds.\r\nAnd because of these things, I measure deeds after your manner, and judge\r\nmen, and think thoughts.  Wherefore, when I speak harshly of one of your\r\nown kind, I know you will not take it amiss; and when I speak high of one\r\nof my father\'s people, you will not take it upon you to say, \'Sitka\r\nCharley is Siwash, and there is a crooked light in his eyes and small\r\nhonor to his tongue.\'  Is it not so?"\r\n\r\nDeep down in throat, the circle vouchsafed its assent.\r\n\r\n"The woman was Passuk.  I got her in fair trade from her people, who were\r\nof the Coast and whose Chilcat totem stood at the head of a salt arm of\r\nthe sea.  My heart did not go out to the woman, nor did I take stock of\r\nher looks.  For she scarce took her eyes from the ground, and she was\r\ntimid and afraid, as girls will be when cast into a stranger\'s arms whom\r\nthey have never seen before.  As I say, there was no place in my heart\r\nfor her to creep, for I had a great journey in mind, and stood in need of\r\none to feed my dogs and to lift a paddle with me through the long river\r\ndays.  One blanket would cover the twain; so I chose Passuk.\r\n\r\n"Have I not said I was a servant to the Government?  If not, it is well\r\nthat ye know.  So I was taken on a warship, sleds and dogs and evaporated\r\nfoods, and with me came Passuk.  And we went north, to the winter ice-rim\r\nof Bering Sea, where we were landed,--myself, and Passuk, and the dogs.  I\r\nwas also given moneys of the Government, for I was its servant, and\r\ncharts of lands which the eyes of man had never dwelt upon, and messages.\r\nThese messages were sealed, and protected shrewdly from the weather, and\r\nI was to deliver them to the whale-ships of the Arctic, ice-bound by the\r\ngreat Mackenzie.  Never was there so great a river, forgetting only our\r\nown Yukon, the Mother of all Rivers.\r\n\r\n"All of which is neither here nor there, for my story deals not with the\r\nwhale-ships, nor the berg-bound winter I spent by the Mackenzie.\r\nAfterward, in the spring, when the days lengthened and there was a crust\r\nto the snow, we came south, Passuk and I, to the Country of the Yukon.  A\r\nweary journey, but the sun pointed out the way of our feet.  It was a\r\nnaked land then, as I have said, and we worked up the current, with pole\r\nand paddle, till we came to Forty Mile.  Good it was to see white faces\r\nonce again, so we put into the bank.  And that winter was a hard winter.\r\nThe darkness and the cold drew down upon us, and with them the famine.  To\r\neach man the agent of the Company gave forty pounds of flour and twenty\r\nof bacon.  There were no beans.  And, the dogs howled always, and there\r\nwere flat bellies and deep-lined faces, and strong men became weak, and\r\nweak men died.  There was also much scurvy.\r\n\r\n"Then came we together in the store one night, and the empty shelves made\r\nus feel our own emptiness the more.  We talked low, by the light of the\r\nfire, for the candles had been set aside for those who might yet gasp in\r\nthe spring.  Discussion was held, and it was said that a man must go\r\nforth to the Salt Water and tell to the world our misery.  At this all\r\neyes turned to me, for it was understood that I was a great traveler.  \'It\r\nis seven hundred miles,\' said I, \'to Haines Mission by the sea, and every\r\ninch of it snowshoe work.  Give me the pick of your dogs and the best of\r\nyour grub, and I will go.  And with me shall go Passuk.\'\r\n\r\n"To this they were agreed.  But there arose one, Long Jeff, a Yankee-man,\r\nbig-boned and big-muscled.  Also his talk was big.  He, too, was a mighty\r\ntraveler, he said, born to the snowshoe and bred up on buffalo milk.  He\r\nwould go with me, in case I fell by the trail, that he might carry the\r\nword on to the Mission.  I was young, and I knew not Yankee-men.  How was\r\nI to know that big talk betokened the streak of fat, or that Yankee-men\r\nwho did great things kept their teeth together?  So we took the pick of\r\nthe dogs and the best of the grub, and struck the trail, we\r\nthree,--Passuk, Long Jeff, and I.\r\n\r\n"Well, ye have broken virgin snow, labored at the gee-pole, and are not\r\nunused to the packed river-jams; so I will talk little of the toil, save\r\nthat on some days we made ten miles, and on others thirty, but more often\r\nten.  And the best of the grub was not good, while we went on stint from\r\nthe start.  Likewise the pick of the dogs was poor, and we were hard put\r\nto keep them on their legs.  At the White River our three sleds became\r\ntwo sleds, and we had only come two hundred miles.  But we lost nothing;\r\nthe dogs that left the traces went into the bellies of those that\r\nremained.\r\n\r\n"Not a greeting, not a curl of smoke, till we made Pelly.  Here I had\r\ncounted on grub; and here I had counted on leaving Long Jeff, who was\r\nwhining and trail-sore.  But the factor\'s lungs were wheezing, his eyes\r\nbright, his cache nigh empty; and he showed us the empty cache of the\r\nmissionary, also his grave with the rocks piled high to keep off the\r\ndogs.  There was a bunch of Indians there, but babies and old men there\r\nwere none, and it was clear that few would see the spring.\r\n\r\n"So we pulled on, light-stomached and heavy-hearted, with half a thousand\r\nmiles of snow and silence between us and Haines Mission by the sea.  The\r\ndarkness was at its worst, and at midday the sun could not clear the sky-\r\nline to the south.  But the ice-jams were smaller, the going better; so I\r\npushed the dogs hard and traveled late and early.  As I said at Forty\r\nMile, every inch of it was snow-shoe work.  And the shoes made great\r\nsores on our feet, which cracked and scabbed but would not heal.  And\r\nevery day these sores grew more grievous, till in the morning, when we\r\ngirded on the shoes, Long Jeff cried like a child.  I put him at the fore\r\nof the light sled to break trail, but he slipped off the shoes for\r\ncomfort.  Because of this the trail was not packed, his moccasins made\r\ngreat holes, and into these holes the dogs wallowed.  The bones of the\r\ndogs were ready to break through their hides, and this was not good for\r\nthem.  So I spoke hard words to the man, and he promised, and broke his\r\nword.  Then I beat him with the dog-whip, and after that the dogs\r\nwallowed no more.  He was a child, what of the pain and the streak of\r\nfat.\r\n\r\n"But Passuk.  While the man lay by the fire and wept, she cooked, and in\r\nthe morning helped lash the sleds, and in the evening to unlash them.  And\r\nshe saved the dogs.  Ever was she to the fore, lifting the webbed shoes\r\nand making the way easy.  Passuk--how shall I say?--I took it for granted\r\nthat she should do these things, and thought no more about it.  For my\r\nmind was busy with other matters, and besides, I was young in years and\r\nknew little of woman.  It was only on looking back that I came to\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n"And the man became worthless.  The dogs had little strength in them, but\r\nhe stole rides on the sled when he lagged behind.  Passuk said she would\r\ntake the one sled, so the man had nothing to do.  In the morning I gave\r\nhim his fair share of grub and started him on the trail alone.  Then the\r\nwoman and I broke camp, packed the sleds, and harnessed the dogs.  By\r\nmidday, when the sun mocked us, we would overtake the man, with the tears\r\nfrozen on his cheeks, and pass him.  In the night we made camp, set aside\r\nhis fair share of grub, and spread his furs.  Also we made a big fire,\r\nthat he might see.  And hours afterward he would come limping in, and eat\r\nhis grub with moans and groans, and sleep.  He was not sick, this man.  He\r\nwas only trail-sore and tired, and weak with hunger.  But Passuk and I\r\nwere trail-sore and tired, and weak with hunger; and we did all the work\r\nand he did none.  But he had the streak of fat of which our brother\r\nBettles has spoken.  Further, we gave the man always his fair share of\r\ngrub.\r\n\r\n"Then one day we met two ghosts journeying through the Silence.  They\r\nwere a man and a boy, and they were white.  The ice had opened on Lake Le\r\nBarge, and through it had gone their main outfit.  One blanket each\r\ncarried about his shoulders.  At night they built a fire and crouched\r\nover it till morning.  They had a little flour.  This they stirred in\r\nwarm water and drank.  The man showed me eight cups of flour--all they\r\nhad, and Pelly, stricken with famine, two hundred miles away.  They said,\r\nalso, that there was an Indian behind; that they had whacked fair, but\r\nthat he could not keep up.  I did not believe they had whacked fair, else\r\nwould the Indian have kept up.  But I could give them no grub.  They\r\nstrove to steal a dog--the fattest, which was very thin--but I shoved my\r\npistol in their faces and told them begone.  And they went away, like\r\ndrunken men, through the Silence toward Pelly.\r\n\r\n"I had three dogs now, and one sled, and the dogs were only bones and\r\nhair.  When there is little wood, the fire burns low and the cabin grows\r\ncold.  So with us.  With little grub the frost bites sharp, and our faces\r\nwere black and frozen till our own mothers would not have known us.  And\r\nour feet were very sore.  In the morning, when I hit the trail, I sweated\r\nto keep down the cry when the pain of the snowshoes smote me.  Passuk\r\nnever opened her lips, but stepped to the fore to break the way.  The man\r\nhowled.\r\n\r\n"The Thirty Mile was swift, and the current ate away the ice from\r\nbeneath, and there were many air-holes and cracks, and much open water.\r\nOne day we came upon the man, resting, for he had gone ahead, as was his\r\nwont, in the morning.  But between us was open water.  This he had passed\r\naround by taking to the rim-ice where it was too narrow for a sled.  So\r\nwe found an ice-bridge.  Passuk weighed little, and went first, with a\r\nlong pole crosswise in her hands in chance she broke through.  But she\r\nwas light, and her shoes large, and she passed over.  Then she called the\r\ndogs.  But they had neither poles nor shoes, and they broke through and\r\nwere swept under by the water.  I held tight to the sled from behind,\r\ntill the traces broke and the dogs went on down under the ice.  There was\r\nlittle meat to them, but I had counted on them for a week\'s grub, and\r\nthey were gone.\r\n\r\n"The next morning I divided all the grub, which was little, into three\r\nportions.  And I told Long Jeff that he could keep up with us, or not, as\r\nhe saw fit; for we were going to travel light and fast.  But he raised\r\nhis voice and cried over his sore feet and his troubles, and said harsh\r\nthings against comradeship.  Passuk\'s feet were sore, and my feet were\r\nsore--ay, sorer than his, for we had worked with the dogs; also, we\r\nlooked to see.  Long Jeff swore he would die before he hit the trail\r\nagain; so Passuk took a fur robe, and I a cooking pot and an axe, and we\r\nmade ready to go.  But she looked on the man\'s portion, and said, \'It is\r\nwrong to waste good food on a baby.  He is better dead.\'  I shook my head\r\nand said no--that a comrade once was a comrade always.  Then she spoke of\r\nthe men of Forty Mile; that they were many men and good; and that they\r\nlooked to me for grub in the spring.  But when I still said no, she\r\nsnatched the pistol from my belt, quick, and as our brother Bettles has\r\nspoken, Long Jeff went to the bosom of Abraham before his time.  I chided\r\nPassuk for this; but she showed no sorrow, nor was she sorrowful.  And in\r\nmy heart I knew she was right."\r\n\r\nSitka Charley paused and threw pieces of ice into the gold pan on the\r\nstove.  The men were silent, and their backs chilled to the sobbing cries\r\nof the dogs as they gave tongue to their misery in the outer cold.\r\n\r\n"And day by day we passed in the snow the sleeping-places of the two\r\nghosts--Passuk and I--and we knew we would be glad for such ere we made\r\nSalt Water.  Then we came to the Indian, like another ghost, with his\r\nface set toward Pelly.  They had not whacked up fair, the man and the\r\nboy, he said, and he had had no flour for three days.  Each night he\r\nboiled pieces of his moccasins in a cup, and ate them.  He did not have\r\nmuch moccasins left.  And he was a Coast Indian, and told us these things\r\nthrough Passuk, who talked his tongue.  He was a stranger in the Yukon,\r\nand he knew not the way, but his face was set to Pelly.  How far was it?\r\nTwo sleeps? ten? a hundred--he did not know, but he was going to Pelly.\r\nIt was too far to turn back; he could only keep on.\r\n\r\n"He did not ask for grub, for he could see we, too, were hard put.  Passuk\r\nlooked at the man, and at me, as though she were of two minds, like a\r\nmother partridge whose young are in trouble.  So I turned to her and\r\nsaid, \'This man has been dealt unfair.  Shall I give him of our grub a\r\nportion?\'  I saw her eyes light, as with quick pleasure; but she looked\r\nlong at the man and at me, and her mouth drew close and hard, and she\r\nsaid, \'No.  The Salt Water is afar off, and Death lies in wait.  Better\r\nit is that he take this stranger man and let my man Charley pass.\'  So\r\nthe man went away in the Silence toward Pelly.  That night she wept.\r\nNever had I seen her weep before.  Nor was it the smoke of the fire, for\r\nthe wood was dry wood.  So I marveled at her sorrow, and thought her\r\nwoman\'s heart had grown soft at the darkness of the trail and the pain.\r\n\r\n"Life is a strange thing.  Much have I thought on it, and pondered long,\r\nyet daily the strangeness of it grows not less, but more.  Why this\r\nlonging for Life?  It is a game which no man wins.  To live is to toil\r\nhard, and to suffer sore, till Old Age creeps heavily upon us and we\r\nthrow down our hands on the cold ashes of dead fires.  It is hard to\r\nlive.  In pain the babe sucks his first breath, in pain the old man gasps\r\nhis last, and all his days are full of trouble and sorrow; yet he goes\r\ndown to the open arms of Death, stumbling, falling, with head turned\r\nbackward, fighting to the last.  And Death is kind.  It is only Life, and\r\nthe things of Life that hurt.  Yet we love Life, and we hate Death.  It\r\nis very strange.\r\n\r\n"We spoke little, Passuk and I, in the days which came.  In the night we\r\nlay in the snow like dead people, and in the morning we went on our way,\r\nwalking like dead people.  And all things were dead.  There were no\r\nptarmigan, no squirrels, no snowshoe rabbits,--nothing.  The river made\r\nno sound beneath its white robes.  The sap was frozen in the forest.  And\r\nit became cold, as now; and in the night the stars drew near and large,\r\nand leaped and danced; and in the day the sun-dogs mocked us till we saw\r\nmany suns, and all the air flashed and sparkled, and the snow was diamond\r\ndust.  And there was no heat, no sound, only the bitter cold and the\r\nSilence.  As I say, we walked like dead people, as in a dream, and we\r\nkept no count of time.  Only our faces were set to Salt Water, our souls\r\nstrained for Salt Water, and our feet carried us toward Salt Water.  We\r\ncamped by the Tahkeena, and knew it not.  Our eyes looked upon the White\r\nHorse, but we saw it not.  Our feet trod the portage of the Canyon, but\r\nthey felt it not.  We felt nothing.  And we fell often by the way, but we\r\nfell, always, with our faces toward Salt Water.\r\n\r\n"Our last grub went, and we had shared fair, Passuk and I, but she fell\r\nmore often, and at Caribou Crossing her strength left her.  And in the\r\nmorning we lay beneath the one robe and did not take the trail.  It was\r\nin my mind to stay there and meet Death hand-in-hand with Passuk; for I\r\nhad grown old, and had learned the love of woman.  Also, it was eighty\r\nmiles to Haines Mission, and the great Chilcoot, far above the timber-\r\nline, reared his storm-swept head between.  But Passuk spoke to me, low,\r\nwith my ear against her lips that I might hear.  And now, because she\r\nneed not fear my anger, she spoke her heart, and told me of her love, and\r\nof many things which I did not understand.\r\n\r\n"And she said: \'You are my man, Charley, and I have been a good woman to\r\nyou.  And in all the days I have made your fire, and cooked your food,\r\nand fed your dogs, and lifted paddle or broken trail, I have not\r\ncomplained.  Nor did I say that there was more warmth in the lodge of my\r\nfather, or that there was more grub on the Chilcat.  When you have\r\nspoken, I have listened.  When you have ordered, I have obeyed.  Is it\r\nnot so, Charley?\'\r\n\r\n"And I said: \'Ay, it is so.\'\r\n\r\n"And she said: \'When first you came to the Chilcat, nor looked upon me,\r\nbut bought me as a man buys a dog, and took me away, my heart was hard\r\nagainst you and filled with bitterness and fear.  But that was long ago.\r\nFor you were kind to me, Charley, as a good man is kind to his dog.  Your\r\nheart was cold, and there was no room for me; yet you dealt me fair and\r\nyour ways were just.  And I was with you when you did bold deeds and led\r\ngreat ventures, and I measured you against the men of other breeds, and I\r\nsaw you stood among them full of honor, and your word was wise, your\r\ntongue true.  And I grew proud of you, till it came that you filled all\r\nmy heart, and all my thought was of you.  You were as the midsummer sun,\r\nwhen its golden trail runs in a circle and never leaves the sky.  And\r\nwhatever way I cast my eyes I beheld the sun.  But your heart was ever\r\ncold, Charley, and there was no room.\'\r\n\r\n"And I said: \'It is so.  It was cold, and there was no room.  But that is\r\npast.  Now my heart is like the snowfall in the spring, when the sun has\r\ncome back.  There is a great thaw and a bending, a sound of running\r\nwaters, and a budding and sprouting of green things.  And there is\r\ndrumming of partridges, and songs of robins, and great music, for the\r\nwinter is broken, Passuk, and I have learned the love of woman.\'\r\n\r\n"She smiled and moved for me to draw her closer.  And she said, \'I am\r\nglad.\'  After that she lay quiet for a long time, breathing softly, her\r\nhead upon my breast.  Then she whispered: \'The trail ends here, and I am\r\ntired.  But first I would speak of other things.  In the long ago, when I\r\nwas a girl on the Chilcat, I played alone among the skin bales of my\r\nfather\'s lodge; for the men were away on the hunt, and the women and boys\r\nwere dragging in the meat.  It was in the spring, and I was alone.  A\r\ngreat brown bear, just awake from his winter\'s sleep, hungry, his fur\r\nhanging to the bones in flaps of leanness, shoved his head within the\r\nlodge and said, "Oof!"  My brother came running back with the first sled\r\nof meat.  And he fought the bear with burning sticks from the fire, and\r\nthe dogs in their harnesses, with the sled behind them, fell upon the\r\nbear.  There was a great battle and much noise.  They rolled in the fire,\r\nthe skin bales were scattered, the lodge overthrown.  But in the end the\r\nbear lay dead, with the fingers of my brother in his mouth and the marks\r\nof his claws upon my brother\'s face.  Did you mark the Indian by the\r\nPelly trail, his mitten which had no thumb, his hand which he warmed by\r\nour fire?  He was my brother.  And I said he should have no grub.  And he\r\nwent away in the Silence without grub.\'\r\n\r\n"This, my brothers, was the love of Passuk, who died in the snow, by the\r\nCaribou Crossing.  It was a mighty love, for she denied her brother for\r\nthe man who led her away on weary trails to a bitter end.  And, further,\r\nsuch was this woman\'s love, she denied herself.  Ere her eyes closed for\r\nthe last time she took my hand and slipped it under her squirrel-skin\r\n_parka_ to her waist.  I felt there a well-filled pouch, and learned the\r\nsecret of her lost strength.  Day by day we had shared fair, to the last\r\nleast bit; and day by day but half her share had she eaten.  The other\r\nhalf had gone into the well-filled pouch.\r\n\r\n"And she said: \'This is the end of the trail for Passuk; but your trail,\r\nCharley, leads on and on, over the great Chilcoot, down to Haines Mission\r\nand the sea.  And it leads on and on, by the light of many suns, over\r\nunknown lands and strange waters, and it is full of years and honors and\r\ngreat glories.  It leads you to the lodges of many women, and good women,\r\nbut it will never lead you to a greater love than the love of Passuk.\'\r\n\r\n"And I knew the woman spoke true.  But a madness came upon me, and I\r\nthrew the well-filled pouch from me, and swore that my trail had reached\r\nan end, till her tired eyes grew soft with tears, and she said: \'Among\r\nmen has Sitka Charley walked in honor, and ever has his word been true.\r\nDoes he forget that honor now, and talk vain words by the Caribou\r\nCrossing?  Does he remember no more the men of Forty Mile, who gave him\r\nof their grub the best, of their dogs the pick?  Ever has Passuk been\r\nproud of her man.  Let him lift himself up, gird on his snowshoes, and\r\nbegone, that she may still keep her pride.\'\r\n\r\n"And when she grew cold in my arms I arose, and sought out the\r\nwell-filled pouch, and girt on my snowshoes, and staggered along the\r\ntrail; for there was a weakness in my knees, and my head was dizzy, and\r\nin my ears there was a roaring, and a flashing of fire upon my eyes.  The\r\nforgotten trails of boyhood came back to me.  I sat by the full pots of\r\nthe _potlach_ feast, and raised my voice in song, and danced to the\r\nchanting of the men and maidens and the booming of the walrus drums.  And\r\nPassuk held my hand and walked by my side.  When I laid down to sleep,\r\nshe waked me.  When I stumbled and fell, she raised me.  When I wandered\r\nin the deep snow, she led me back to the trail.  And in this wise, like a\r\nman bereft of reason, who sees strange visions and whose thoughts are\r\nlight with wine, I came to Haines Mission by the sea."\r\n\r\nSitka Charley threw back the tent-flaps.  It was midday.  To the south,\r\njust clearing the bleak Henderson Divide, poised the cold-disked sun.  On\r\neither hand the sun-dogs blazed.  The air was a gossamer of glittering\r\nfrost.  In the foreground, beside the trail, a wolf-dog, bristling with\r\nfrost, thrust a long snout heavenward and mourned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE THE TRAIL FORKS\r\n\r\n\r\n   "Must I, then, must I, then, now leave this town--\r\n   And you, my love, stay here?"--_Schwabian Folk-song_.\r\n\r\nThe singer, clean-faced and cheery-eyed, bent over and added water to a\r\npot of simmering beans, and then, rising, a stick of firewood in hand,\r\ndrove back the circling dogs from the grub-box and cooking-gear.  He was\r\nblue of eye, and his long hair was golden, and it was a pleasure to look\r\nupon his lusty freshness.  A new moon was thrusting a dim horn above the\r\nwhite line of close-packed snow-capped pines which ringed the camp and\r\nsegregated it from all the world.  Overhead, so clear it was and cold,\r\nthe stars danced with quick, pulsating movements.  To the southeast an\r\nevanescent greenish glow heralded the opening revels of the aurora\r\nborealis.  Two men, in the immediate foreground, lay upon the bearskin\r\nwhich was their bed.  Between the skin and naked snow was a six-inch\r\nlayer of pine boughs.  The blankets were rolled back.  For shelter, there\r\nwas a fly at their backs,--a sheet of canvas stretched between two trees\r\nand angling at forty-five degrees.  This caught the radiating heat from\r\nthe fire and flung it down upon the skin.  Another man sat on a sled,\r\ndrawn close to the blaze, mending moccasins.  To the right, a heap of\r\nfrozen gravel and a rude windlass denoted where they toiled each day in\r\ndismal groping for the pay-streak.  To the left, four pairs of snowshoes\r\nstood erect, showing the mode of travel which obtained when the stamped\r\nsnow of the camp was left behind.\r\n\r\nThat Schwabian folk-song sounded strangely pathetic under the cold\r\nnorthern stars, and did not do the men good who lounged about the fire\r\nafter the toil of the day.  It put a dull ache into their hearts, and a\r\nyearning which was akin to belly-hunger, and sent their souls questing\r\nsouthward across the divides to the sun-lands.\r\n\r\n"For the love of God, Sigmund, shut up!" expostulated one of the men.  His\r\nhands were clenched painfully, but he hid them from sight in the folds of\r\nthe bearskin upon which he lay.\r\n\r\n"And what for, Dave Wertz?" Sigmund demanded.  "Why shall I not sing when\r\nthe heart is glad?"\r\n\r\n"Because you\'ve got no call to, that\'s why.  Look about you, man, and\r\nthink of the grub we\'ve been defiling our bodies with for the last\r\ntwelvemonth, and the way we\'ve lived and worked like beasts!"\r\n\r\nThus abjured, Sigmund, the golden-haired, surveyed it all, and the frost-\r\nrimmed wolf-dogs and the vapor breaths of the men.  "And why shall not\r\nthe heart be glad?" he laughed.  "It is good; it is all good.  As for the\r\ngrub--"  He doubled up his arm and caressed the swelling biceps.  "And if\r\nwe have lived and worked like beasts, have we not been paid like kings?\r\nTwenty dollars to the pan the streak is running, and we know it to be\r\neight feet thick.  It is another Klondike--and we know it--Jim Hawes\r\nthere, by your elbow, knows it and complains not.  And there\'s Hitchcock!\r\nHe sews moccasins like an old woman, and waits against the time.  Only\r\nyou can\'t wait and work until the wash-up in the spring.  Then we shall\r\nall be rich, rich as kings, only you cannot wait.  You want to go back to\r\nthe States.  So do I, and I was born there, but I can wait, when each day\r\nthe gold in the pan shows up yellow as butter in the churning.  But you\r\nwant your good time, and, like a child, you cry for it now.  Bah!  Why\r\nshall I not sing:\r\n\r\n   "In a year, in a year, when the grapes are ripe,\r\n      I shall stay no more away.\r\n   Then if you still are true, my love,\r\n      It will be our wedding day.\r\n   In a year, in a year, when my time is past,\r\n      Then I\'ll live in your love for aye.\r\n   Then if you still are true, my love,\r\n      It will be our wedding day."\r\n\r\nThe dogs, bristling and growling, drew in closer to the firelight.  There\r\nwas a monotonous crunch-crunch of webbed shoes, and between each crunch\r\nthe dragging forward of the heel of the shoe like the sound of sifting\r\nsugar.  Sigmund broke off from his song to hurl oaths and firewood at the\r\nanimals.  Then the light was parted by a fur-clad figure, and an Indian\r\ngirl slipped out of the webs, threw back the hood of her squirrel-skin\r\n_parka_, and stood in their midst.  Sigmund and the men on the bearskin\r\ngreeted her as "Sipsu," with the customary "Hello," but Hitchcock made\r\nroom on the sled that she might sit beside him.\r\n\r\n"And how goes it, Sipsu?" he asked, talking, after her fashion, in broken\r\nEnglish and bastard Chinook.  "Is the hunger still mighty in the camp?\r\nand has the witch doctor yet found the cause wherefore game is scarce and\r\nno moose in the land?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; even so.  There is little game, and we prepare to eat the dogs.\r\nAlso has the witch doctor found the cause of all this evil, and to-morrow\r\nwill he make sacrifice and cleanse the camp."\r\n\r\n"And what does the sacrifice chance to be?--a new-born babe or some poor\r\ndevil of a squaw, old and shaky, who is a care to the tribe and better\r\nout of the way?"\r\n\r\n"It chanced not that wise; for the need was great, and he chose none\r\nother than the chief\'s daughter; none other than I, Sipsu."\r\n\r\n"Hell!"  The word rose slowly to Hitchcock\'s lips, and brimmed over full\r\nand deep, in a way which bespoke wonder and consideration.\r\n\r\n"Wherefore we stand by a forking of the trail, you and I," she went on\r\ncalmly, "and I have come that we may look once more upon each other, and\r\nonce more only."\r\n\r\nShe was born of primitive stock, and primitive had been her traditions\r\nand her days; so she regarded life stoically, and human sacrifice as part\r\nof the natural order.  The powers which ruled the day-light and the dark,\r\nthe flood and the frost, the bursting of the bud and the withering of the\r\nleaf, were angry and in need of propitiation.  This they exacted in many\r\nways,--death in the bad water, through the treacherous ice-crust, by the\r\ngrip of the grizzly, or a wasting sickness which fell upon a man in his\r\nown lodge till he coughed, and the life of his lungs went out through his\r\nmouth and nostrils.  Likewise did the powers receive sacrifice.  It was\r\nall one.  And the witch doctor was versed in the thoughts of the powers\r\nand chose unerringly.  It was very natural.  Death came by many ways, yet\r\nwas it all one after all,--a manifestation of the all-powerful and\r\ninscrutable.\r\n\r\nBut Hitchcock came of a later world-breed.  His traditions were less\r\nconcrete and without reverence, and he said, "Not so, Sipsu.  You are\r\nyoung, and yet in the full joy of life.  The witch doctor is a fool, and\r\nhis choice is evil.  This thing shall not be."\r\n\r\nShe smiled and answered, "Life is not kind, and for many reasons.  First,\r\nit made of us twain the one white and the other red, which is bad.  Then\r\nit crossed our trails, and now it parts them again; and we can do\r\nnothing.  Once before, when the gods were angry, did your brothers come\r\nto the camp.  They were three, big men and white, and they said the thing\r\nshall not be.  But they died quickly, and the thing was."\r\n\r\nHitchcock nodded that he heard, half-turned, and lifted his voice.  "Look\r\nhere, you fellows!  There\'s a lot of foolery going on over to the camp,\r\nand they\'re getting ready to murder Sipsu.  What d\'ye say?"\r\n\r\nWertz looked at Hawes, and Hawes looked back, but neither spoke.  Sigmund\r\ndropped his head, and petted the shepherd dog between his knees.  He had\r\nbrought Shep in with him from the outside, and thought a great deal of\r\nthe animal.  In fact, a certain girl, who was much in his thoughts, and\r\nwhose picture in the little locket on his breast often inspired him to\r\nsing, had given him the dog and her blessing when they kissed good-by and\r\nhe started on his Northland quest.\r\n\r\n"What d\'ye say?" Hitchcock repeated.\r\n\r\n"Mebbe it\'s not so serious," Hawes answered with deliberation.  "Most\r\nlikely it\'s only a girl\'s story."\r\n\r\n"That isn\'t the point!"  Hitchcock felt a hot flush of anger sweep over\r\nhim at their evident reluctance.  "The question is, if it is so, are we\r\ngoing to stand it?  What are we going to do?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see any call to interfere," spoke up Wertz.  "If it is so, it is\r\nso, and that\'s all there is about it.  It\'s a way these people have of\r\ndoing.  It\'s their religion, and it\'s no concern of ours.  Our concern is\r\nto get the dust and then get out of this God-forsaken land.  \'T isn\'t fit\r\nfor naught else but beasts?  And what are these black devils but beasts?\r\nBesides, it\'d be damn poor policy."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I say," chimed in Hawes.  "Here we are, four of us, three\r\nhundred miles from the Yukon or a white face.  And what can we do against\r\nhalf-a-hundred Indians?  If we quarrel with them, we have to vamose; if\r\nwe fight, we are wiped out.  Further, we\'ve struck pay, and, by God! I,\r\nfor one, am going to stick by it!"\r\n\r\n"Ditto here," supplemented Wertz.\r\n\r\nHitchcock turned impatiently to Sigmund, who was softly singing,--\r\n\r\n   "In a year, in a year, when the grapes are ripe,\r\n      I shall stay no more away."\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s this way, Hitchcock," he finally said, "I\'m in the same boat\r\nwith the rest.  If three-score bucks have made up their mind to kill the\r\ngirl, why, we can\'t help it.  One rush, and we\'d be wiped off the\r\nlandscape.  And what good\'d that be?  They\'d still have the girl.  There\'s\r\nno use in going against the customs of a people except you\'re in force."\r\n\r\n"But we are in force!" Hitchcock broke in.  "Four whites are a match for\r\na hundred times as many reds.  And think of the girl!"\r\n\r\nSigmund stroked the dog meditatively.  "But I do think of the girl.  And\r\nher eyes are blue like summer skies, and laughing like summer seas, and\r\nher hair is yellow, like mine, and braided in ropes the size of a big\r\nman\'s arms.  She\'s waiting for me, out there, in a better land.  And\r\nshe\'s waited long, and now my pile\'s in sight I\'m not going to throw it\r\naway."\r\n\r\n"And shamed I would be to look into the girl\'s blue eyes and remember the\r\nblack ones of the girl whose blood was on my hands," Hitchcock sneered;\r\nfor he was born to honor and championship, and to do the thing for the\r\nthing\'s sake, nor stop to weigh or measure.\r\n\r\nSigmund shook his head.  "You can\'t make me mad, Hitchcock, nor do mad\r\nthings because of your madness.  It\'s a cold business proposition and a\r\nquestion of facts.  I didn\'t come to this country for my health, and,\r\nfurther, it\'s impossible for us to raise a hand.  If it is so, it is too\r\nbad for the girl, that\'s all.  It\'s a way of her people, and it just\r\nhappens we\'re on the spot this one time.  They\'ve done the same for a\r\nthousand-thousand years, and they\'re going to do it now, and they\'ll go\r\non doing it for all time to come.  Besides, they\'re not our kind.  Nor\'s\r\nthe girl.  No, I take my stand with Wertz and Hawes, and--"\r\n\r\nBut the dogs snarled and drew in, and he broke off, listening to the\r\ncrunch-crunch of many snowshoes.  Indian after Indian stalked into the\r\nfirelight, tall and grim, fur-clad and silent, their shadows dancing\r\ngrotesquely on the snow.  One, the witch doctor, spoke gutturally to\r\nSipsu.  His face was daubed with savage paint blotches, and over his\r\nshoulders was drawn a wolfskin, the gleaming teeth and cruel snout\r\nsurmounting his head.  No other word was spoken.  The prospectors held\r\nthe peace.  Sipsu arose and slipped into her snowshoes.\r\n\r\n"Good-by, O my man," she said to Hitchcock.  But the man who had sat\r\nbeside her on the sled gave no sign, nor lifted his head as they filed\r\naway into the white forest.\r\n\r\nUnlike many men, his faculty of adaptation, while large, had never\r\nsuggested the expediency of an alliance with the women of the Northland.\r\nHis broad cosmopolitanism had never impelled toward covenanting in\r\nmarriage with the daughters of the soil.  If it had, his philosophy of\r\nlife would not have stood between.  But it simply had not.  Sipsu?  He\r\nhad pleasured in camp-fire chats with her, not as a man who knew himself\r\nto be man and she woman, but as a man might with a child, and as a man of\r\nhis make certainly would if for no other reason than to vary the tedium\r\nof a bleak existence.  That was all.  But there was a certain chivalric\r\nthrill of warm blood in him, despite his Yankee ancestry and New England\r\nupbringing, and he was so made that the commercial aspect of life often\r\nseemed meaningless and bore contradiction to his deeper impulses.\r\n\r\nSo he sat silent, with head bowed forward, an organic force, greater than\r\nhimself, as great as his race, at work within him.  Wertz and Hawes\r\nlooked askance at him from time to time, a faint but perceptible\r\ntrepidation in their manner.  Sigmund also felt this.  Hitchcock was\r\nstrong, and his strength had been impressed upon them in the course of\r\nmany an event in their precarious life.  So they stood in a certain\r\ndefinite awe and curiosity as to what his conduct would be when he moved\r\nto action.\r\n\r\nBut his silence was long, and the fire nigh out, when Wertz stretched his\r\narms and yawned, and thought he\'d go to bed.  Then Hitchcock stood up his\r\nfull height.\r\n\r\n"May God damn your souls to the deepest hells, you chicken-hearted\r\ncowards!  I\'m done with you!"  He said it calmly enough, but his strength\r\nspoke in every syllable, and every intonation was advertisement of\r\nintention.  "Come on," he continued, "whack up, and in whatever way suits\r\nyou best.  I own a quarter-interest in the claims; our contracts show\r\nthat.  There\'re twenty-five or thirty ounces in the sack from the test\r\npans.  Fetch out the scales.  We\'ll divide that now.  And you, Sigmund,\r\nmeasure me my quarter-share of the grub and set it apart.  Four of the\r\ndogs are mine, and I want four more.  I\'ll trade you my share in the camp\r\noutfit and mining-gear for the dogs.  And I\'ll throw in my six or seven\r\nounces and the spare 45-90 with the ammunition.  What d\'ye say?"\r\n\r\nThe three men drew apart and conferred.  When they returned, Sigmund\r\nacted as spokesman.  "We\'ll whack up fair with you, Hitchcock.  In\r\neverything you\'ll get your quarter-share, neither more nor less; and you\r\ncan take it or leave it.  But we want the dogs as bad as you do, so you\r\nget four, and that\'s all.  If you don\'t want to take your share of the\r\noutfit and gear, why, that\'s your lookout.  If you want it, you can have\r\nit; if you don\'t, leave it."\r\n\r\n"The letter of the law," Hitchcock sneered.  "But go ahead.  I\'m willing.\r\nAnd hurry up.  I can\'t get out of this camp and away from its vermin any\r\ntoo quick."\r\n\r\nThe division was effected without further comment.  He lashed his meagre\r\nbelongings upon one of the sleds, rounded in his four dogs, and harnessed\r\nup.  His portion of outfit and gear he did not touch, though he threw\r\nonto the sled half a dozen dog harnesses, and challenged them with his\r\neyes to interfere.  But they shrugged their shoulders and watched him\r\ndisappear in the forest.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nA man crawled upon his belly through the snow.  On every hand loomed the\r\nmoose-hide lodges of the camp.  Here and there a miserable dog howled or\r\nsnarled abuse upon his neighbor.  Once, one of them approached the\r\ncreeping man, but the man became motionless.  The dog came closer and\r\nsniffed, and came yet closer, till its nose touched the strange object\r\nwhich had not been there when darkness fell.  Then Hitchcock, for it was\r\nHitchcock, upreared suddenly, shooting an unmittened hand out to the\r\nbrute\'s shaggy throat.  And the dog knew its death in that clutch, and\r\nwhen the man moved on, was left broken-necked under the stars.  In this\r\nmanner Hitchcock made the chief\'s lodge.  For long he lay in the snow\r\nwithout, listening to the voices of the occupants and striving to locate\r\nSipsu.  Evidently there were many in the tent, and from the sounds they\r\nwere in high excitement.  At last he heard the girl\'s voice, and crawled\r\naround so that only the moose-hide divided them.  Then burrowing in the\r\nsnow, he slowly wormed his head and shoulders underneath.  When the warm\r\ninner air smote his face, he stopped and waited, his legs and the greater\r\npart of his body still on the outside.  He could see nothing, nor did he\r\ndare lift his head.  On one side of him was a skin bale.  He could smell\r\nit, though he carefully felt to be certain.  On the other side his face\r\nbarely touched a furry garment which he knew clothed a body.  This must\r\nbe Sipsu.  Though he wished she would speak again, he resolved to risk\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe could hear the chief and the witch doctor talking high, and in a far\r\ncorner some hungry child whimpering to sleep.  Squirming over on his\r\nside, he carefully raised his head, still just touching the furry\r\ngarment.  He listened to the breathing.  It was a woman\'s breathing; he\r\nwould chance it.\r\n\r\nHe pressed against her side softly but firmly, and felt her start at the\r\ncontact.  Again he waited, till a questioning hand slipped down upon his\r\nhead and paused among the curls.  The next instant the hand turned his\r\nface gently upward, and he was gazing into Sipsu\'s eyes.\r\n\r\nShe was quite collected.  Changing her position casually, she threw an\r\nelbow well over on the skin bale, rested her body upon it, and arranged\r\nher _parka_.  In this way he was completely concealed.  Then, and still\r\nmost casually, she reclined across him, so that he could breathe between\r\nher arm and breast, and when she lowered her head her ear pressed lightly\r\nagainst his lips.\r\n\r\n"When the time suits, go thou," he whispered, "out of the lodge and\r\nacross the snow, down the wind to the bunch of jackpine in the curve of\r\nthe creek.  There wilt thou find my dogs and my sled, packed for the\r\ntrail.  This night we go down to the Yukon; and since we go fast, lay\r\nthou hands upon what dogs come nigh thee, by the scruff of the neck, and\r\ndrag them to the sled in the curve of the creek."\r\n\r\nSipsu shook her head in dissent; but her eyes glistened with gladness,\r\nand she was proud that this man had shown toward her such favor.  But\r\nshe, like the women of all her race, was born to obey the will masculine,\r\nand when Hitchcock repeated "Go!" he did it with authority, and though\r\nshe made no answer he knew that his will was law.\r\n\r\n"And never mind harness for the dogs," he added, preparing to go.  "I\r\nshall wait.  But waste no time.  The day chaseth the night alway, nor\r\ndoes it linger for man\'s pleasure."\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, stamping his feet and swinging his arms by the sled,\r\nhe saw her coming, a surly dog in either hand.  At the approach of these\r\nhis own animals waxed truculent, and he favored them with the butt of his\r\nwhip till they quieted.  He had approached the camp up the wind, and\r\nsound was the thing to be most feared in making his presence known.\r\n\r\n"Put them into the sled," he ordered when she had got the harness on the\r\ntwo dogs.  "I want my leaders to the fore."\r\n\r\nBut when she had done this, the displaced animals pitched upon the\r\naliens.  Though Hitchcock plunged among them with clubbed rifle, a riot\r\nof sound went up and across the sleeping camp.\r\n\r\n"Now we shall have dogs, and in plenty," he remarked grimly, slipping an\r\naxe from the sled lashings.  "Do thou harness whichever I fling thee, and\r\nbetweenwhiles protect the team."\r\n\r\nHe stepped a space in advance and waited between two pines.  The dogs of\r\nthe camp were disturbing the night with their jangle, and he watched for\r\ntheir coming.  A dark spot, growing rapidly, took form upon the dim white\r\nexpanse of snow.  It was a forerunner of the pack, leaping cleanly, and,\r\nafter the wolf fashion, singing direction to its brothers.  Hitchcock\r\nstood in the shadow.  As it sprang past, he reached out, gripped its\r\nforelegs in mid-career, and sent it whirling earthward.  Then he struck\r\nit a well-judged blow beneath the ear, and flung it to Sipsu.  And while\r\nshe clapped on the harness, he, with his axe, held the passage between\r\nthe trees, till a shaggy flood of white teeth and glistening eyes surged\r\nand crested just beyond reach.  Sipsu worked rapidly.  When she had\r\nfinished, he leaped forward, seized and stunned a second, and flung it to\r\nher.  This he repeated thrice again, and when the sled team stood\r\nsnarling in a string of ten, he called, "Enough!"\r\n\r\nBut at this instant a young buck, the forerunner of the tribe, and swift\r\nof limb, wading through the dogs and cuffing right and left, attempted\r\nthe passage.  The butt of Hitchcock\'s rifle drove him to his knees,\r\nwhence he toppled over sideways.  The witch doctor, running lustily, saw\r\nthe blow fall.\r\n\r\nHitchcock called to Sipsu to pull out.  At her shrill "Chook!" the\r\nmaddened brutes shot straight ahead, and the sled, bounding mightily,\r\njust missed unseating her.  The powers were evidently angry with the\r\nwitch doctor, for at this moment they plunged him upon the trail.  The\r\nlead-dog fouled his snowshoes and tripped him up, and the nine succeeding\r\ndogs trod him under foot and the sled bumped over him.  But he was quick\r\nto his feet, and the night might have turned out differently had not\r\nSipsu struck backward with the long dog-whip and smitten him a blinding\r\nblow across the eyes.  Hitchcock, hurrying to overtake her, collided\r\nagainst him as he swayed with pain in the middle of the trail.  Thus it\r\nwas, when this primitive theologian got back to the chief\'s lodge, that\r\nhis wisdom had been increased in so far as concerns the efficacy of the\r\nwhite man\'s fist.  So, when he orated then and there in the council, he\r\nwas wroth against all white men.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n"Tumble out, you loafers!  Tumble out!  Grub\'ll be ready before you get\r\ninto your footgear!"\r\n\r\nDave Wertz threw off the bearskin, sat up, and yawned.\r\n\r\nHawes stretched, discovered a lame muscle in his arm, and rubbed it\r\nsleepily.  "Wonder where Hitchcock bunked last night?" he queried,\r\nreaching for his moccasins.  They were stiff, and he walked gingerly in\r\nhis socks to the fire to thaw them out.  "It\'s a blessing he\'s gone," he\r\nadded, "though he was a mighty good worker."\r\n\r\n"Yep.  Too masterful.  That was his trouble.  Too bad for Sipsu.  Think\r\nhe cared for her much?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t think so.  Just principle.  That\'s all.  He thought it wasn\'t\r\nright--and, of course, it wasn\'t,--but that was no reason for us to\r\ninterfere and get hustled over the divide before our time."\r\n\r\n"Principle is principle, and it\'s good in its place, but it\'s best left\r\nto home when you go to Alaska.  Eh?"  Wertz had joined his mate, and both\r\nwere working pliability into their frozen moccasins.  "Think we ought to\r\nhave taken a hand?"\r\n\r\nSigmund shook his head.  He was very busy.  A scud of chocolate-colored\r\nfoam was rising in the coffee-pot, and the bacon needed turning.  Also,\r\nhe was thinking about the girl with laughing eyes like summer seas, and\r\nhe was humming softly.\r\n\r\nHis mates chuckled to each other and ceased talking.  Though it was past\r\nseven, daybreak was still three hours distant.  The aurora borealis had\r\npassed out of the sky, and the camp was an oasis of light in the midst of\r\ndeep darkness.  And in this light the forms of the three men were sharply\r\ndefined.  Emboldened by the silence, Sigmund raised his voice and opened\r\nthe last stanza of the old song:-\r\n\r\n   "In a year, in a year, when the grapes are ripe--"\r\n\r\nThen the night was split with a rattling volley of rifle-shots.  Hawes\r\nsighed, made an effort to straighten himself, and collapsed.  Wertz went\r\nover on an elbow with drooping head.  He choked a little, and a dark\r\nstream flowed from his mouth.  And Sigmund, the Golden-Haired, his throat\r\na-gurgle with the song, threw up his arms and pitched across the fire.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe witch doctor\'s eyes were well blackened, and his temper none of the\r\nbest; for he quarrelled with the chief over the possession of Wertz\'s\r\nrifle, and took more than his share of the part-sack of beans.  Also he\r\nappropriated the bearskin, and caused grumbling among the tribesmen.  And\r\nfinally, he tried to kill Sigmund\'s dog, which the girl had given him,\r\nbut the dog ran away, while he fell into the shaft and dislocated his\r\nshoulder on the bucket.  When the camp was well looted they went back to\r\ntheir own lodges, and there was a great rejoicing among the women.\r\nFurther, a band of moose strayed over the south divide and fell before\r\nthe hunters, so the witch doctor attained yet greater honor, and the\r\npeople whispered among themselves that he spoke in council with the gods.\r\n\r\nBut later, when all were gone, the shepherd dog crept back to the\r\ndeserted camp, and all the night long and a day it wailed the dead.  After\r\nthat it disappeared, though the years were not many before the Indian\r\nhunters noted a change in the breed of timber wolves, and there were\r\ndashes of bright color and variegated markings such as no wolf bore\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DAUGHTER OF THE AURORA\r\n\r\n\r\n"You--what you call--lazy mans, you lazy mans would desire me to haf for\r\nwife.  It is not good.  Nevaire, no, nevaire, will lazy mans my hoosband\r\nbe."\r\n\r\nThus Joy Molineau spoke her mind to Jack Harrington, even as she had\r\nspoken it, but more tritely and in his own tongue, to Louis Savoy the\r\nprevious night.\r\n\r\n"Listen, Joy--"\r\n\r\n"No, no; why moos\' I listen to lazy mans?  It is vaire bad, you hang\r\nrount, make visitation to my cabin, and do nothing.  How you get grub for\r\nthe famine?  Why haf not you the dust?  Odder mans haf plentee."\r\n\r\n"But I work hard, Joy.  Never a day am I not on trail or up creek.  Even\r\nnow have I just come off.  My dogs are yet tired.  Other men have luck\r\nand find plenty of gold; but I--I have no luck."\r\n\r\n"Ah!  But when this mans with the wife which is Indian, this mans\r\nMcCormack, when him discovaire the Klondike, you go not.  Odder mans go;\r\nodder mans now rich."\r\n\r\n"You know I was prospecting over on the head-reaches of the Tanana,"\r\nHarrington protested, "and knew nothing of the Eldorado or Bonanza until\r\nit was too late."\r\n\r\n"That is deeferent; only you are--what you call way off."\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Way off.  In the--yes--in the dark.  It is nevaire too late.  One vaire\r\nrich mine is there, on the creek which is Eldorado.  The mans drive the\r\nstake and him go \'way.  No odddr mans know what of him become.  The mans,\r\nhim which drive the stake, is nevaire no more.  Sixty days no mans on\r\nthat claim file the papaire.  Then odder mans, plentee odder mans--what\r\nyou call--jump that claim.  Then they race, O so queek, like the wind, to\r\nfile the papaire.  Him be vaire rich.  Him get grub for famine."\r\n\r\nHarrington hid the major portion of his interest.\r\n\r\n"When\'s the time up?" he asked.  "What claim is it?"\r\n\r\n"So I speak Louis Savoy last night," she continued, ignoring him.  "Him I\r\nthink the winnaire."\r\n\r\n"Hang Louis Savoy!"\r\n\r\n"So Louis Savoy speak in my cabin last night.  Him say, \'Joy, I am strong\r\nmans.  I haf good dogs.  I haf long wind.  I will be winnaire.  Then you\r\nwill haf me for hoosband?\'  And I say to him, I say--"\r\n\r\n"What\'d you say?"\r\n\r\n"I say, \'If Louis Savoy is winnaire, then will he haf me for wife.\'"\r\n\r\n"And if he don\'t win?"\r\n\r\n"Then Louis Savoy, him will not be--what you call--the father of my\r\nchildren."\r\n\r\n"And if I win?"\r\n\r\n"You winnaire?  Ha! ha!  Nevaire!"\r\n\r\nExasperating as it was, Joy Molineau\'s laughter was pretty to hear.\r\nHarrington did not mind it.  He had long since been broken in.  Besides,\r\nhe was no exception.  She had forced all her lovers to suffer in kind.\r\nAnd very enticing she was just then, her lips parted, her color\r\nheightened by the sharp kiss of the frost, her eyes vibrant with the lure\r\nwhich is the greatest of all lures and which may be seen nowhere save in\r\nwoman\'s eyes.  Her sled-dogs clustered about her in hirsute masses, and\r\nthe leader, Wolf Fang, laid his long snout softly in her lap.\r\n\r\n"If I do win?" Harrington pressed.\r\n\r\nShe looked from dog to lover and back again.\r\n\r\n"What you say, Wolf Fang?  If him strong mans and file the papaire, shall\r\nwe his wife become?  Eh?  What you say?"\r\n\r\nWolf Fang picked up his ears and growled at Harrington.\r\n\r\n"It is vaire cold," she suddenly added with feminine irrelevance, rising\r\nto her feet and straightening out the team.\r\n\r\nHer lover looked on stolidly.  She had kept him guessing from the first\r\ntime they met, and patience had been joined unto his virtues.\r\n\r\n"Hi!  Wolf Fang!" she cried, springing upon the sled as it leaped into\r\nsudden motion.  "Ai!  Ya!  Mush-on!"\r\n\r\nFrom the corner of his eye Harrington watched her swinging down the trail\r\nto Forty Mile.  Where the road forked and crossed the river to Fort\r\nCudahy, she halted the dogs and turned about.\r\n\r\n"O Mistaire Lazy Mans!" she called back.  "Wolf Fang, him say yes--if you\r\nwinnaire!"\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nBut somehow, as such things will, it leaked out, and all Forty Mile,\r\nwhich had hitherto speculated on Joy Molineau\'s choice between her two\r\nlatest lovers, now hazarded bets and guesses as to which would win in the\r\nforthcoming race.  The camp divided itself into two factions, and every\r\neffort was put forth in order that their respective favorites might be\r\nthe first in at the finish.  There was a scramble for the best dogs the\r\ncountry could afford, for dogs, and good ones, were essential, above all,\r\nto success.  And it meant much to the victor.  Besides the possession of\r\na wife, the like of which had yet to be created, it stood for a mine\r\nworth a million at least.\r\n\r\nThat fall, when news came down of McCormack\'s discovery on Bonanza, all\r\nthe Lower Country, Circle City and Forty Mile included, had stampeded up\r\nthe Yukon,--at least all save those who, like Jack Harrington and Louis\r\nSavoy, were away prospecting in the west.  Moose pastures and creeks were\r\nstaked indiscriminately and promiscuously; and incidentally, one of the\r\nunlikeliest of creeks, Eldorado.  Olaf Nelson laid claim to five hundred\r\nof its linear feet, duly posted his notice, and as duly disappeared.  At\r\nthat time the nearest recording office was in the police barracks at Fort\r\nCudahy, just across the river from Forty Mile; but when it became bruited\r\nabroad that Eldorado Creek was a treasure-house, it was quickly\r\ndiscovered that Olaf Nelson had failed to make the down-Yukon trip to\r\nfile upon his property.  Men cast hungry eyes upon the ownerless claim,\r\nwhere they knew a thousand-thousand dollars waited but shovel and sluice-\r\nbox.  Yet they dared not touch it; for there was a law which permitted\r\nsixty days to lapse between the staking and the filing, during which time\r\na claim was immune.  The whole country knew of Olaf Nelson\'s\r\ndisappearance, and scores of men made preparation for the jumping and for\r\nthe consequent race to Fort Cudahy.\r\n\r\nBut competition at Forty Mile was limited.  With the camp devoting its\r\nenergies to the equipping either of Jack Harrington or Louis Savoy, no\r\nman was unwise enough to enter the contest single-handed.  It was a\r\nstretch of a hundred miles to the Recorder\'s office, and it was planned\r\nthat the two favorites should have four relays of dogs stationed along\r\nthe trail.  Naturally, the last relay was to be the crucial one, and for\r\nthese twenty-five miles their respective partisans strove to obtain the\r\nstrongest possible animals.  So bitter did the factions wax, and so high\r\ndid they bid, that dogs brought stiffer prices than ever before in the\r\nannals of the country.  And, as it chanced, this scramble for dogs turned\r\nthe public eye still more searchingly upon Joy Molineau.  Not only was\r\nshe the cause of it all, but she possessed the finest sled-dog from\r\nChilkoot to Bering Sea.  As wheel or leader, Wolf Fang had no equal.  The\r\nman whose sled he led down the last stretch was bound to win.  There\r\ncould be no doubt of it.  But the community had an innate sense of the\r\nfitness of things, and not once was Joy vexed by overtures for his use.\r\nAnd the factions drew consolation from the fact that if one man did not\r\nprofit by him, neither should the other.\r\n\r\nHowever, since man, in the individual or in the aggregate, has been so\r\nfashioned that he goes through life blissfully obtuse to the deeper\r\nsubtleties of his womankind, so the men of Forty Mile failed to divine\r\nthe inner deviltry of Joy Molineau.  They confessed, afterward, that they\r\nhad failed to appreciate this dark-eyed daughter of the aurora, whose\r\nfather had traded furs in the country before ever they dreamed of\r\ninvading it, and who had herself first opened eyes on the scintillant\r\nnorthern lights.  Nay, accident of birth had not rendered her less the\r\nwoman, nor had it limited her woman\'s understanding of men.  They knew\r\nshe played with them, but they did not know the wisdom of her play, its\r\ndeepness and its deftness.  They failed to see more than the exposed\r\ncard, so that to the very last Forty Mile was in a state of pleasant\r\nobfuscation, and it was not until she cast her final trump that it came\r\nto reckon up the score.\r\n\r\nEarly in the week the camp turned out to start Jack Harrington and Louis\r\nSavoy on their way.  They had taken a shrewd margin of time, for it was\r\ntheir wish to arrive at Olaf Nelson\'s claim some days previous to the\r\nexpiration of its immunity, that they might rest themselves, and their\r\ndogs be fresh for the first relay.  On the way up they found the men of\r\nDawson already stationing spare dog teams along the trail, and it was\r\nmanifest that little expense had been spared in view of the millions at\r\nstake.\r\n\r\nA couple of days after the departure of their champions, Forty Mile began\r\nsending up their relays,--first to the seventy-five station, then to the\r\nfifty, and last to the twenty-five.  The teams for the last stretch were\r\nmagnificent, and so equally matched that the camp discussed their\r\nrelative merits for a full hour at fifty below, before they were\r\npermitted to pull out.  At the last moment Joy Molineau dashed in among\r\nthem on her sled.  She drew Lon McFane, who had charge of Harrington\'s\r\nteam, to one side, and hardly had the first words left her lips when it\r\nwas noticed that his lower jaw dropped with a celerity and emphasis\r\nsuggestive of great things.  He unhitched Wolf Fang from her sled, put\r\nhim at the head of Harrington\'s team, and mushed the string of animals\r\ninto the Yukon trail.\r\n\r\n"Poor Louis Savoy!" men said; but Joy Molineau flashed her black eyes\r\ndefiantly and drove back to her father\'s cabin.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nMidnight drew near on Olaf Nelson\'s claim.  A few hundred fur-clad men\r\nhad preferred sixty below and the jumping, to the inducements of warm\r\ncabins and comfortable bunks.  Several score of them had their notices\r\nprepared for posting and their dogs at hand.  A bunch of Captain\r\nConstantine\'s mounted police had been ordered on duty that fair play\r\nmight rule.  The command had gone forth that no man should place a stake\r\ntill the last second of the day had ticked itself into the past.  In the\r\nnorthland such commands are equal to Jehovah\'s in the matter of potency;\r\nthe dum-dum as rapid and effective as the thunderbolt.  It was clear and\r\ncold.  The aurora borealis painted palpitating color revels on the sky.\r\nRosy waves of cold brilliancy swept across the zenith, while great\r\ncoruscating bars of greenish white blotted out the stars, or a Titan\'s\r\nhand reared mighty arches above the Pole.  And at this mighty display the\r\nwolf-dogs howled as had their ancestors of old time.\r\n\r\nA bearskin-coated policeman stepped prominently to the fore, watch in\r\nhand.  Men hurried among the dogs, rousing them to their feet, untangling\r\ntheir traces, straightening them out.  The entries came to the mark,\r\nfirmly gripping stakes and notices.  They had gone over the boundaries of\r\nthe claim so often that they could now have done it blindfolded.  The\r\npoliceman raised his hand.  Casting off their superfluous furs and\r\nblankets, and with a final cinching of belts, they came to attention.\r\n\r\n"Time!"\r\n\r\nSixty pairs of hands unmitted; as many pairs of moccasins gripped hard\r\nupon the snow.\r\n\r\n"Go!"\r\n\r\nThey shot across the wide expanse, round the four sides, sticking notices\r\nat every corner, and down the middle where the two centre stakes were to\r\nbe planted.  Then they sprang for the sleds on the frozen bed of the\r\ncreek.  An anarchy of sound and motion broke out.  Sled collided with\r\nsled, and dog-team fastened upon dog-team with bristling manes and\r\nscreaming fangs.  The narrow creek was glutted with the struggling mass.\r\nLashes and butts of dog-whips were distributed impartially among men and\r\nbrutes.  And to make it of greater moment, each participant had a bunch\r\nof comrades intent on breaking him out of jam.  But one by one, and by\r\nsheer strength, the sleds crept out and shot from sight in the darkness\r\nof the overhanging banks.\r\n\r\nJack Harrington had anticipated this crush and waited by his sled until\r\nit untangled.  Louis Savoy, aware of his rival\'s greater wisdom in the\r\nmatter of dog-driving, had followed his lead and also waited.  The rout\r\nhad passed beyond earshot when they took the trail, and it was not till\r\nthey had travelled the ten miles or so down to Bonanza that they came\r\nupon it, speeding along in single file, but well bunched.  There was\r\nlittle noise, and less chance of one passing another at that stage.  The\r\nsleds, from runner to runner, measured sixteen inches, the trail\r\neighteen; but the trail, packed down fully a foot by the traffic, was\r\nlike a gutter.  On either side spread the blanket of soft snow crystals.\r\nIf a man turned into this in an endeavor to pass, his dogs would wallow\r\nperforce to their bellies and slow down to a snail\'s pace.  So the men\r\nlay close to their leaping sleds and waited.  No alteration in position\r\noccurred down the fifteen miles of Bonanza and Klondike to Dawson, where\r\nthe Yukon was encountered.  Here the first relays waited.  But here,\r\nintent to kill their first teams, if necessary, Harrington and Savoy had\r\nhad their fresh teams placed a couple of miles beyond those of the\r\nothers.  In the confusion of changing sleds they passed full half the\r\nbunch.  Perhaps thirty men were still leading them when they shot on to\r\nthe broad breast of the Yukon.  Here was the tug.  When the river froze\r\nin the fall, a mile of open water had been left between two mighty jams.\r\nThis had but recently crusted, the current being swift, and now it was as\r\nlevel, hard, and slippery as a dance floor.  The instant they struck this\r\nglare ice Harrington came to his knees, holding precariously on with one\r\nhand, his whip singing fiercely among his dogs and fearsome abjurations\r\nhurtling about their ears.  The teams spread out on the smooth surface,\r\neach straining to the uttermost.  But few men in the North could lift\r\ntheir dogs as did Jack Harrington.  At once he began to pull ahead, and\r\nLouis Savoy, taking the pace, hung on desperately, his leaders running\r\neven with the tail of his rival\'s sled.\r\n\r\nMidway on the glassy stretch their relays shot out from the bank.  But\r\nHarrington did not slacken.  Watching his chance when the new sled swung\r\nin close, he leaped across, shouting as he did so and jumping up the pace\r\nof his fresh dogs.  The other driver fell off somehow.  Savoy did\r\nlikewise with his relay, and the abandoned teams, swerving to right and\r\nleft, collided with the others and piled the ice with confusion.\r\nHarrington cut out the pace; Savoy hung on.  As they neared the end of\r\nthe glare ice, they swept abreast of the leading sled.  When they shot\r\ninto the narrow trail between the soft snowbanks, they led the race; and\r\nDawson, watching by the light of the aurora, swore that it was neatly\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nWhen the frost grows lusty at sixty below, men cannot long remain without\r\nfire or excessive exercise, and live.  So Harrington and Savoy now fell\r\nto the ancient custom of "ride and run."  Leaping from their sleds, tow-\r\nthongs in hand, they ran behind till the blood resumed its wonted\r\nchannels and expelled the frost, then back to the sleds till the heat\r\nagain ebbed away.  Thus, riding and running, they covered the second and\r\nthird relays.  Several times, on smooth ice, Savoy spurted his dogs, and\r\nas often failed to gain past.  Strung along for five miles in the rear,\r\nthe remainder of the race strove to overtake them, but vainly, for to\r\nLouis Savoy alone was the glory given of keeping Jack Harrington\'s\r\nkilling pace.\r\n\r\nAs they swung into the seventy-five-mile station, Lon McFane dashed\r\nalongside; Wolf Fang in the lead caught Harrington\'s eye, and he knew\r\nthat the race was his.  No team in the North could pass him on those last\r\ntwenty-five miles.  And when Savoy saw Wolf Fang heading his rival\'s\r\nteam, he knew that he was out of the running, and he cursed softly to\r\nhimself, in the way woman is most frequently cursed.  But he still clung\r\nto the other\'s smoking trail, gambling on chance to the last.  And as\r\nthey churned along, the day breaking in the southeast, they marvelled in\r\njoy and sorrow at that which Joy Molineau had done.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nForty Mile had early crawled out of its sleeping furs and congregated\r\nnear the edge of the trail.  From this point it could view the up-Yukon\r\ncourse to its first bend several miles away.  Here it could also see\r\nacross the river to the finish at Fort Cudahy, where the Gold Recorder\r\nnervously awaited.  Joy Molineau had taken her position several rods back\r\nfrom the trail, and under the circumstances, the rest of Forty Mile\r\nforbore interposing itself.  So the space was clear between her and the\r\nslender line of the course.  Fires had been built, and around these men\r\nwagered dust and dogs, the long odds on Wolf Fang.\r\n\r\n"Here they come!" shrilled an Indian boy from the top of a pine.\r\n\r\nUp the Yukon a black speck appeared against the snow, closely followed by\r\na second.  As these grew larger, more black specks manifested themselves,\r\nbut at a goodly distance to the rear.  Gradually they resolved themselves\r\ninto dogs and sleds, and men lying flat upon them.  "Wolf Fang leads," a\r\nlieutenant of police whispered to Joy.  She smiled her interest back.\r\n\r\n"Ten to one on Harrington!" cried a Birch Creek King, dragging out his\r\nsack.\r\n\r\n"The Queen, her pay you not mooch?" queried Joy.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant shook his head.\r\n\r\n"You have some dust, ah, how mooch?" she continued.\r\n\r\nHe exposed his sack.  She gauged it with a rapid eye.\r\n\r\n"Mebbe--say--two hundred, eh?  Good.  Now I give--what you call--the tip.\r\nCovaire the bet."  Joy smiled inscrutably.  The lieutenant pondered.  He\r\nglanced up the trail.  The two men had risen to their knees and were\r\nlashing their dogs furiously, Harrington in the lead.\r\n\r\n"Ten to one on Harrington!" bawled the Birch Creek King, flourishing his\r\nsack in the lieutenant\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Covaire the bet," Joy prompted.\r\n\r\nHe obeyed, shrugging his shoulders in token that he yielded, not to the\r\ndictate of his reason, but to her charm.  Joy nodded to reassure him.\r\n\r\nAll noise ceased.  Men paused in the placing of bets.\r\n\r\nYawing and reeling and plunging, like luggers before the wind, the sleds\r\nswept wildly upon them.  Though he still kept his leader up to the tail\r\nof Harrington\'s sled, Louis Savoy\'s face was without hope.  Harrington\'s\r\nmouth was set.  He looked neither to the right nor to the left.  His dogs\r\nwere leaping in perfect rhythm, firm-footed, close to the trail, and Wolf\r\nFang, head low and unseeing, whining softly, was leading his comrades\r\nmagnificently.\r\n\r\nForty Mile stood breathless.  Not a sound, save the roar of the runners\r\nand the voice of the whips.\r\n\r\nThen the clear voice of Joy Molineau rose on the air.  "Ai!  Ya!  Wolf\r\nFang!  Wolf Fang!"\r\n\r\nWolf Fang heard.  He left the trail sharply, heading directly for his\r\nmistress.  The team dashed after him, and the sled poised an instant on a\r\nsingle runner, then shot Harrington into the snow.  Savoy was by like a\r\nflash.  Harrington pulled to his feet and watched him skimming across the\r\nriver to the Gold Recorder\'s.  He could not help hearing what was said.\r\n\r\n"Ah, him do vaire well," Joy Molineau was explaining to the lieutenant.\r\n"Him--what you call--set the pace.  Yes, him set the pace vaire well."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE RAINBOW\'S END\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was for two reasons that Montana Kid discarded his "chaps" and Mexican\r\nspurs, and shook the dust of the Idaho ranges from his feet.  In the\r\nfirst place, the encroachments of a steady, sober, and sternly moral\r\ncivilization had destroyed the primeval status of the western cattle\r\nranges, and refined society turned the cold eye of disfavor upon him and\r\nhis ilk.  In the second place, in one of its cyclopean moments the race\r\nhad arisen and shoved back its frontier several thousand miles.  Thus,\r\nwith unconscious foresight, did mature society make room for its\r\nadolescent members.  True, the new territory was mostly barren; but its\r\nseveral hundred thousand square miles of frigidity at least gave\r\nbreathing space to those who else would have suffocated at home.\r\n\r\nMontana Kid was such a one.  Heading for the sea-coast, with a haste\r\nseveral sheriff\'s posses might possibly have explained, and with more\r\nnerve than coin of the realm, he succeeded in shipping from a Puget Sound\r\nport, and managed to survive the contingent miseries of steerage\r\nsea-sickness and steerage grub.  He was rather sallow and drawn, but\r\nstill his own indomitable self, when he landed on the Dyea beach one day\r\nin the spring of the year.  Between the cost of dogs, grub, and outfits,\r\nand the customs exactions of the two clashing governments, it speedily\r\npenetrated to his understanding that the Northland was anything save a\r\npoor man\'s Mecca.  So he cast about him in search of quick harvests.\r\nBetween the beach and the passes were scattered many thousands of\r\npassionate pilgrims.  These pilgrims Montana Kid proceeded to farm.  At\r\nfirst he dealt faro in a pine-board gambling shack; but disagreeable\r\nnecessity forced him to drop a sudden period into a man\'s life, and to\r\nmove on up trail.  Then he effected a corner in horseshoe nails, and they\r\ncirculated at par with legal tender, four to the dollar, till an\r\nunexpected consignment of a hundred barrels or so broke the market and\r\nforced him to disgorge his stock at a loss.  After that he located at\r\nSheep Camp, organized the professional packers, and jumped the freight\r\nten cents a pound in a single day.  In token of their gratitude, the\r\npackers patronized his faro and roulette layouts and were mulcted\r\ncheerfully of their earnings.  But his commercialism was of too lusty a\r\ngrowth to be long endured; so they rushed him one night, burned his\r\nshanty, divided the bank, and headed him up the trail with empty pockets.\r\n\r\nIll-luck was his running mate.  He engaged with responsible parties to\r\nrun whisky across the line by way of precarious and unknown trails, lost\r\nhis Indian guides, and had the very first outfit confiscated by the\r\nMounted Police.  Numerous other misfortunes tended to make him bitter of\r\nheart and wanton of action, and he celebrated his arrival at Lake Bennett\r\nby terrorizing the camp for twenty straight hours.  Then a miners\'\r\nmeeting took him in hand, and commanded him to make himself scarce.  He\r\nhad a wholesome respect for such assemblages, and he obeyed in such haste\r\nthat he inadvertently removed himself at the tail-end of another man\'s\r\ndog team.  This was equivalent to horse-stealing in a more mellow clime,\r\nso he hit only the high places across Bennett and down Tagish, and made\r\nhis first camp a full hundred miles to the north.\r\n\r\nNow it happened that the break of spring was at hand, and many of the\r\nprincipal citizens of Dawson were travelling south on the last ice.  These\r\nhe met and talked with, noted their names and possessions, and passed on.\r\nHe had a good memory, also a fair imagination; nor was veracity one of\r\nhis virtues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nDawson, always eager for news, beheld Montana Kid\'s sled heading down the\r\nYukon, and went out on the ice to meet him.  No, he hadn\'t any\r\nnewspapers; didn\'t know whether Durrant was hanged yet, nor who had won\r\nthe Thanksgiving game; hadn\'t heard whether the United States and Spain\r\nhad gone to fighting; didn\'t know who Dreyfus was; but O\'Brien?  Hadn\'t\r\nthey heard?  O\'Brien, why, he was drowned in the White Horse; Sitka\r\nCharley the only one of the party who escaped.  Joe Ladue?  Both legs\r\nfrozen and amputated at the Five Fingers.  And Jack Dalton?  Blown up on\r\nthe "Sea Lion" with all hands.  And Bettles?  Wrecked on the\r\n"Carthagina," in Seymour Narrows,--twenty survivors out of three hundred.\r\nAnd Swiftwater Bill?  Gone through the rotten ice of Lake LeBarge with\r\nsix female members of the opera troupe he was convoying.  Governor Walsh?\r\nLost with all hands and eight sleds on the Thirty Mile.  Devereaux?  Who\r\nwas Devereaux?  Oh, the courier!  Shot by Indians on Lake Marsh.\r\n\r\nSo it went.  The word was passed along.  Men shouldered in to ask after\r\nfriends and partners, and in turn were shouldered out, too stunned for\r\nblasphemy.  By the time Montana Kid gained the bank he was surrounded by\r\nseveral hundred fur-clad miners.  When he passed the Barracks he was the\r\ncentre of a procession.  At the Opera House he was the nucleus of an\r\nexcited mob, each member struggling for a chance to ask after some absent\r\ncomrade.  On every side he was being invited to drink.  Never before had\r\nthe Klondike thus opened its arms to a che-cha-qua.  All Dawson was\r\nhumming.  Such a series of catastrophes had never occurred in its\r\nhistory.  Every man of note who had gone south in the spring had been\r\nwiped out.  The cabins vomited forth their occupants.  Wild-eyed men\r\nhurried down from the creeks and gulches to seek out this man who had\r\ntold a tale of such disaster.  The Russian half-breed wife of Bettles\r\nsought the fireplace, inconsolable, and rocked back and forth, and ever\r\nand anon flung white wood-ashes upon her raven hair.  The flag at the\r\nBarracks flopped dismally at half-mast.  Dawson mourned its dead.\r\n\r\nWhy Montana Kid did this thing no man may know.  Nor beyond the fact that\r\nthe truth was not in him, can explanation be hazarded.  But for five\r\nwhole days he plunged the land in wailing and sorrow, and for five whole\r\ndays he was the only man in the Klondike.  The country gave him its best\r\nof bed and board.  The saloons granted him the freedom of their bars.  Men\r\nsought him continuously.  The high officials bowed down to him for\r\nfurther information, and he was feasted at the Barracks by Constantine\r\nand his brother officers.  And then, one day, Devereaux, the government\r\ncourier, halted his tired dogs before the gold commissioner\'s office.\r\nDead?  Who said so?  Give him a moose steak and he\'d show them how dead\r\nhe was.  Why, Governor Walsh was in camp on the Little Salmon, and\r\nO\'Brien coming in on the first water.  Dead?  Give him a moose steak and\r\nhe\'d show them.\r\n\r\nAnd forthwith Dawson hummed.  The Barracks\' flag rose to the masthead,\r\nand Bettles\' wife washed herself and put on clean raiment.  The community\r\nsubtly signified its desire that Montana Kid obliterate himself from the\r\nlandscape.  And Montana Kid obliterated; as usual, at the tail-end of\r\nsome one else\'s dog team.  Dawson rejoiced when he headed down the Yukon,\r\nand wished him godspeed to the ultimate destination of the case-hardened\r\nsinner.  After that the owner of the dogs bestirred himself, made\r\ncomplaint to Constantine, and from him received the loan of a policeman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Circle City in prospect and the last ice crumbling under his\r\nrunners, Montana Kid took advantage of the lengthening days and travelled\r\nhis dogs late and early.  Further, he had but little doubt that the owner\r\nof the dogs in question had taken his trail, and he wished to make\r\nAmerican territory before the river broke.  But by the afternoon of the\r\nthird day it became evident that he had lost in his race with spring.  The\r\nYukon was growling and straining at its fetters.  Long detours became\r\nnecessary, for the trail had begun to fall through into the swift current\r\nbeneath, while the ice, in constant unrest, was thundering apart in great\r\ngaping fissures.  Through these and through countless airholes, the water\r\nbegan to sweep across the surface of the ice, and by the time he pulled\r\ninto a woodchopper\'s cabin on the point of an island, the dogs were being\r\nrushed off their feet and were swimming more often than not.  He was\r\ngreeted sourly by the two residents, but he unharnessed and proceeded to\r\ncook up.\r\n\r\nDonald and Davy were fair specimens of frontier inefficients.  Canadian-\r\nborn, city-bred Scots, in a foolish moment they had resigned their\r\ncounting-house desks, drawn upon their savings, and gone Klondiking.  And\r\nnow they were feeling the rough edge of the country.  Grubless,\r\nspiritless, with a lust for home in their hearts, they had been staked by\r\nthe P. C. Company to cut wood for its steamers, with the promise at the\r\nend of a passage home.  Disregarding the possibilities of the ice-run,\r\nthey had fittingly demonstrated their inefficiency by their choice of the\r\nisland on which they located.  Montana Kid, though possessing little\r\nknowledge of the break-up of a great river, looked about him dubiously,\r\nand cast yearning glances at the distant bank where the towering bluffs\r\npromised immunity from all the ice of the Northland.\r\n\r\nAfter feeding himself and dogs, he lighted his pipe and strolled out to\r\nget a better idea of the situation.  The island, like all its river\r\nbrethren, stood higher at the upper end, and it was here that Donald and\r\nDavy had built their cabin and piled many cords of wood.  The far shore\r\nwas a full mile away, while between the island and the near shore lay a\r\nback-channel perhaps a hundred yards across.  At first sight of this,\r\nMontana Kid was tempted to take his dogs and escape to the mainland, but\r\non closer inspection he discovered a rapid current flooding on top.\r\nBelow, the river twisted sharply to the west, and in this turn its breast\r\nwas studded by a maze of tiny islands.\r\n\r\n"That\'s where she\'ll jam," he remarked to himself.\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen sleds, evidently bound up-stream to Dawson, were splashing\r\nthrough the chill water to the tail of the island.  Travel on the river\r\nwas passing from the precarious to the impossible, and it was nip and\r\ntuck with them till they gained the island and came up the path of the\r\nwood-choppers toward the cabin.  One of them, snow-blind, towed\r\nhelplessly at the rear of a sled.  Husky young fellows they were, rough-\r\ngarmented and trail-worn, yet Montana Kid had met the breed before and\r\nknew at once that it was not his kind.\r\n\r\n"Hello!  How\'s things up Dawson-way?" queried the foremost, passing his\r\neye over Donald and Davy and settling it upon the Kid.\r\n\r\nA first meeting in the wilderness is not characterized by formality.  The\r\ntalk quickly became general, and the news of the Upper and Lower\r\nCountries was swapped equitably back and forth.  But the little the\r\nnewcomers had was soon over with, for they had wintered at Minook, a\r\nthousand miles below, where nothing was doing.  Montana Kid, however, was\r\nfresh from Salt Water, and they annexed him while they pitched camp,\r\nswamping him with questions concerning the outside, from which they had\r\nbeen cut off for a twelvemonth.\r\n\r\nA shrieking split, suddenly lifting itself above the general uproar on\r\nthe river, drew everybody to the bank.  The surface water had increased\r\nin depth, and the ice, assailed from above and below, was struggling to\r\ntear itself from the grip of the shores.  Fissures reverberated into life\r\nbefore their eyes, and the air was filled with multitudinous crackling,\r\ncrisp and sharp, like the sound that goes up on a clear day from the\r\nfiring line.\r\n\r\nFrom up the river two men were racing a dog team toward them on an\r\nuncovered stretch of ice.  But even as they looked, the pair struck the\r\nwater and began to flounder through.  Behind, where their feet had sped\r\nthe moment before, the ice broke up and turned turtle.  Through this\r\nopening the river rushed out upon them to their waists, burying the sled\r\nand swinging the dogs off at right angles in a drowning tangle.  But the\r\nmen stopped their flight to give the animals a fighting chance, and they\r\ngroped hurriedly in the cold confusion, slashing at the detaining traces\r\nwith their sheath-knives.  Then they fought their way to the bank through\r\nswirling water and grinding ice, where, foremost in leaping to the rescue\r\namong the jarring fragments, was the Kid.\r\n\r\n"Why, blime me, if it ain\'t Montana Kid!" exclaimed one of the men whom\r\nthe Kid was just placing upon his feet at the top of the bank.  He wore\r\nthe scarlet tunic of the Mounted Police and jocularly raised his right\r\nhand in salute.\r\n\r\n"Got a warrant for you, Kid," he continued, drawing a bedraggled paper\r\nfrom his breast pocket, "an\' I \'ope as you\'ll come along peaceable."\r\n\r\nMontana Kid looked at the chaotic river and shrugged his shoulders, and\r\nthe policeman, following his glance, smiled.\r\n\r\n"Where are the dogs?" his companion asked.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," interrupted the policeman, "this \'ere mate o\' mine is Jack\r\nSutherland, owner of Twenty-Two Eldorado--"\r\n\r\n"Not Sutherland of \'92?" broke in the snow-blinded Minook man, groping\r\nfeebly toward him.\r\n\r\n"The same."  Sutherland gripped his hand.\r\n\r\n"And you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m after your time, but I remember you in my freshman year,--you\r\nwere doing P. G. work then.  Boys," he called, turning half about, "this\r\nis Sutherland, Jack Sutherland, erstwhile full-back on the \'Varsity.  Come\r\nup, you gold-chasers, and fall upon him!  Sutherland, this is\r\nGreenwich,--played quarter two seasons back."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I read of the game," Sutherland said, shaking hands.  "And I\r\nremember that big run of yours for the first touchdown."\r\n\r\nGreenwich flushed darkly under his tanned skin and awkwardly made room\r\nfor another.\r\n\r\n"And here\'s Matthews,--Berkeley man.  And we\'ve got some Eastern cracks\r\nknocking about, too.  Come up, you Princeton men!  Come up!  This is\r\nSutherland, Jack Sutherland!"\r\n\r\nThen they fell upon him heavily, carried him into camp, and supplied him\r\nwith dry clothes and numerous mugs of black tea.\r\n\r\nDonald and Davy, overlooked, had retired to their nightly game of crib.\r\nMontana Kid followed them with the policeman.\r\n\r\n"Here, get into some dry togs," he said, pulling them from out his scanty\r\nkit.  "Guess you\'ll have to bunk with me, too."\r\n\r\n"Well, I say, you\'re a good \'un," the policeman remarked as he pulled on\r\nthe other man\'s socks. "Sorry I\'ve got to take you back to Dawson, but I\r\nonly \'ope they won\'t be \'ard on you."\r\n\r\n"Not so fast."  The Kid smiled curiously.  "We ain\'t under way yet.  When\r\nI go I\'m going down river, and I guess the chances are you\'ll go along."\r\n\r\n"Not if I know myself--"\r\n\r\n"Come on outside, and I\'ll show you, then.  These damn fools," thrusting\r\na thumb over his shoulder at the two Scots, "played smash when they\r\nlocated here.  Fill your pipe, first--this is pretty good plug--and enjoy\r\nyourself while you can.  You haven\'t many smokes before you."\r\n\r\nThe policeman went with him wonderingly, while Donald and Davy dropped\r\ntheir cards and followed.  The Minook men noticed Montana Kid pointing\r\nnow up the river, now down, and came over.\r\n\r\n"What\'s up?" Sutherland demanded.\r\n\r\n"Nothing much."  Nonchalance sat well upon the Kid.  "Just a case of\r\nraising hell and putting a chunk under.  See that bend down there?  That\'s\r\nwhere she\'ll jam millions of tons of ice.  Then she\'ll jam in the bends\r\nup above, millions of tons.  Upper jam breaks first, lower jam holds,\r\npouf!"  He dramatically swept the island with his hand.  "Millions of\r\ntons," he added reflectively.\r\n\r\n"And what of the woodpiles?" Davy questioned.\r\n\r\nThe Kid repeated his sweeping gestures and Davy wailed, "The labor of\r\nmonths!  It canna be!  Na, na, lad, it canna be.  I doot not it\'s a jowk.\r\nAy, say that it is," he appealed.\r\n\r\nBut when the Kid laughed harshly and turned on his heel, Davy flung\r\nhimself upon the piles and began frantically to toss the cordwood back\r\nfrom the bank.\r\n\r\n"Lend a hand, Donald!" he cried.  "Can ye no lend a hand?  \'T is the\r\nlabor of months and the passage home!"\r\n\r\nDonald caught him by the arm and shook him, but he tore free.  "Did ye no\r\nhear, man?  Millions of tons, and the island shall be sweepit clean."\r\n\r\n"Straighten yersel\' up, man," said Donald.  "It\'s a bit fashed ye are."\r\n\r\nBut Davy fell upon the cordwood.  Donald stalked back to the cabin,\r\nbuckled on his money belt and Davy\'s, and went out to the point of the\r\nisland where the ground was highest and where a huge pine towered above\r\nits fellows.\r\n\r\nThe men before the cabin heard the ringing of his axe and smiled.\r\nGreenwich returned from across the island with the word that they were\r\npenned in.  It was impossible to cross the back-channel.  The blind\r\nMinook man began to sing, and the rest joined in with--\r\n\r\n   "Wonder if it\'s true?\r\n   Does it seem so to you?\r\n   Seems to me he\'s lying--\r\n   Oh, I wonder if it\'s true?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s ay sinfu\'," Davy moaned, lifting his head and watching them dance\r\nin the slanting rays of the sun.  "And my guid wood a\' going to waste."\r\n\r\n   "Oh, I wonder if it\'s true,"\r\n\r\nwas flaunted back.\r\n\r\nThe noise of the river ceased suddenly.  A strange calm wrapped about\r\nthem.  The ice had ripped from the shores and was floating higher on the\r\nsurface of the river, which was rising.  Up it came, swift and silent,\r\nfor twenty feet, till the huge cakes rubbed softly against the crest of\r\nthe bank.  The tail of the island, being lower, was overrun.  Then,\r\nwithout effort, the white flood started down-stream.  But the sound\r\nincreased with the momentum, and soon the whole island was shaking and\r\nquivering with the shock of the grinding bergs.  Under pressure, the\r\nmighty cakes, weighing hundreds of tons, were shot into the air like\r\npeas.  The frigid anarchy increased its riot, and the men had to shout\r\ninto one another\'s ears to be heard.  Occasionally the racket from the\r\nback channel could be heard above the tumult.  The island shuddered with\r\nthe impact of an enormous cake which drove in squarely upon its point.  It\r\nripped a score of pines out by the roots, then swinging around and over,\r\nlifted its muddy base from the bottom of the river and bore down upon the\r\ncabin, slicing the bank and trees away like a gigantic knife.  It seemed\r\nbarely to graze the corner of the cabin, but the cribbed logs tilted up\r\nlike matches, and the structure, like a toy house, fell backward in ruin.\r\n\r\n"The labor of months!  The labor of months, and the passage home!" Davy\r\nwailed, while Montana Kid and the policeman dragged him backward from the\r\nwoodpiles.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll \'ave plenty o\' hoppertunity all in good time for yer passage\r\n\'ome," the policeman growled, clouting him alongside the head and sending\r\nhim flying into safety.\r\n\r\nDonald, from the top of the pine, saw the devastating berg sweep away the\r\ncordwood and disappear down-stream.  As though satisfied with this\r\ndamage, the ice-flood quickly dropped to its old level and began to\r\nslacken its pace.  The noise likewise eased down, and the others could\r\nhear Donald shouting from his eyrie to look down-stream.  As forecast,\r\nthe jam had come among the islands in the bend, and the ice was piling up\r\nin a great barrier which stretched from shore to shore.  The river came\r\nto a standstill, and the water finding no outlet began to rise.  It\r\nrushed up till the island was awash, the men splashing around up to their\r\nknees, and the dogs swimming to the ruins of the cabin.  At this stage it\r\nabruptly became stationary, with no perceptible rise or fall.\r\n\r\nMontana Kid shook his head.  "It\'s jammed above, and no more\'s coming\r\ndown."\r\n\r\n"And the gamble is, which jam will break first," Sutherland added.\r\n\r\n"Exactly," the Kid affirmed.  "If the upper jam breaks first, we haven\'t\r\na chance.  Nothing will stand before it."\r\n\r\nThe Minook men turned away in silence, but soon "Rumsky Ho" floated upon\r\nthe quiet air, followed by "The Orange and the Black."  Room was made in\r\nthe circle for Montana Kid and the policeman, and they quickly caught the\r\nringing rhythm of the choruses as they drifted on from song to song.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Donald, will ye no lend a hand?" Davy sobbed at the foot of the tree\r\ninto which his comrade had climbed.  "Oh, Donald, man, will ye no lend a\r\nhand?" he sobbed again, his hands bleeding from vain attempts to scale\r\nthe slippery trunk.\r\n\r\nBut Donald had fixed his gaze up river, and now his voice rang out,\r\nvibrant with fear:--\r\n\r\n   "God Almichty, here she comes!"\r\n\r\nStanding knee-deep in the icy water, the Minook men, with Montana Kid and\r\nthe policeman, gripped hands and raised their voices in the terrible,\r\n"Battle Hymn of the Republic."  But the words were drowned in the\r\nadvancing roar.\r\n\r\nAnd to Donald was vouchsafed a sight such as no man may see and live.  A\r\ngreat wall of white flung itself upon the island.  Trees, dogs, men, were\r\nblotted out, as though the hand of God had wiped the face of nature\r\nclean.  This much he saw, then swayed an instant longer in his lofty\r\nperch and hurtled far out into the frozen hell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCORN OF WOMEN\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce Freda and Mrs. Eppingwell clashed.\r\n\r\nNow Freda was a Greek girl and a dancer.  At least she purported to be\r\nGreek; but this was doubted by many, for her classic face had overmuch\r\nstrength in it, and the tides of hell which rose in her eyes made at rare\r\nmoments her ethnology the more dubious.  To a few--men--this sight had\r\nbeen vouchsafed, and though long years may have passed, they have not\r\nforgotten, nor will they ever forget.  She never talked of herself, so\r\nthat it were well to let it go down that when in repose, expurgated,\r\nGreek she certainly was.  Her furs were the most magnificent in all the\r\ncountry from Chilcoot to St. Michael\'s, and her name was common on the\r\nlips of men.  But Mrs. Eppingwell was the wife of a captain; also a\r\nsocial constellation of the first magnitude, the path of her orbit\r\nmarking the most select coterie in Dawson,--a coterie captioned by the\r\nprofane as the "official clique."  Sitka Charley had travelled trail with\r\nher once, when famine drew tight and a man\'s life was less than a cup of\r\nflour, and his judgment placed her above all women.  Sitka Charley was an\r\nIndian; his criteria were primitive; but his word was flat, and his\r\nverdict a hall-mark in every camp under the circle.\r\n\r\nThese two women were man-conquering, man-subduing machines, each in her\r\nown way, and their ways were different.  Mrs. Eppingwell ruled in her own\r\nhouse, and at the Barracks, where were younger sons galore, to say\r\nnothing of the chiefs of the police, the executive, and the judiciary.\r\nFreda ruled down in the town; but the men she ruled were the same who\r\nfunctioned socially at the Barracks or were fed tea and canned preserves\r\nat the hand of Mrs. Eppingwell in her hillside cabin of rough-hewn logs.\r\nEach knew the other existed; but their lives were apart as the Poles, and\r\nwhile they must have heard stray bits of news and were curious, they were\r\nnever known to ask a question.  And there would have been no trouble had\r\nnot a free lance in the shape of the model-woman come into the land on\r\nthe first ice, with a spanking dog-team and a cosmopolitan reputation.\r\nLoraine Lisznayi--alliterative, dramatic, and Hungarian--precipitated the\r\nstrife, and because of her Mrs. Eppingwell left her hillside and invaded\r\nFreda\'s domain, and Freda likewise went up from the town to spread\r\nconfusion and embarrassment at the Governor\'s ball.\r\n\r\nAll of which may be ancient history so far as the Klondike is concerned,\r\nbut very few, even in Dawson, know the inner truth of the matter; nor\r\nbeyond those few are there any fit to measure the wife of the captain or\r\nthe Greek dancer.  And that all are now permitted to understand, let\r\nhonor be accorded Sitka Charley.  From his lips fell the main facts in\r\nthe screed herewith presented.  It ill befits that Freda herself should\r\nhave waxed confidential to a mere scribbler of words, or that Mrs.\r\nEppingwell made mention of the things which happened.  They may have\r\nspoken, but it is unlikely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nFloyd Vanderlip was a strong man, apparently.  Hard work and hard grub\r\nhad no terrors for him, as his early history in the country attested.  In\r\ndanger he was a lion, and when he held in check half a thousand starving\r\nmen, as he once did, it was remarked that no cooler eye ever took the\r\nglint of sunshine on a rifle-sight.  He had but one weakness, and even\r\nthat, rising from out his strength, was of a negative sort.  His parts\r\nwere strong, but they lacked co-ordination.  Now it happened that while\r\nhis centre of amativeness was pronounced, it had lain mute and passive\r\nduring the years he lived on moose and salmon and chased glowing\r\nEldorados over chill divides.  But when he finally blazed the corner-post\r\nand centre-stakes on one of the richest Klondike claims, it began to\r\nquicken; and when he took his place in society, a full-fledged Bonanza\r\nKing, it awoke and took charge of him.  He suddenly recollected a girl in\r\nthe States, and it came to him quite forcibly, not only that she might be\r\nwaiting for him, but that a wife was a very pleasant acquisition for a\r\nman who lived some several degrees north of 53.  So he wrote an\r\nappropriate note, enclosed a letter of credit generous enough to cover\r\nall expenses, including trousseau and chaperon, and addressed it to one\r\nFlossie.  Flossie?  One could imagine the rest.  However, after that he\r\nbuilt a comfortable cabin on his claim, bought another in Dawson, and\r\nbroke the news to his friends.\r\n\r\nAnd just here is where the lack of co-ordination came into play.  The\r\nwaiting was tedious, and having been long denied, the amative element\r\ncould not brook further delay.  Flossie was coming; but Loraine Lisznayi\r\nwas here.  And not only was Loraine Lisznayi here, but her cosmopolitan\r\nreputation was somewhat the worse for wear, and she was not exactly so\r\nyoung as when she posed in the studios of artist queens and received at\r\nher door the cards of cardinals and princes.  Also, her finances were\r\nunhealthy.  Having run the gamut in her time, she was now not averse to\r\ntrying conclusions with a Bonanza King whose wealth was such that he\r\ncould not guess it within six figures.  Like a wise soldier casting about\r\nafter years of service for a comfortable billet, she had come into the\r\nNorthland to be married.  So, one day, her eyes flashed up into Floyd\r\nVanderlip\'s as he was buying table linen for Flossie in the P. C.\r\nCompany\'s store, and the thing was settled out of hand.\r\n\r\nWhen a man is free much may go unquestioned, which, should he be rash\r\nenough to cumber himself with domestic ties, society will instantly\r\nchallenge.  Thus it was with Floyd Vanderlip.  Flossie was coming, and a\r\nlow buzz went up when Loraine Lisznayi rode down the main street behind\r\nhis wolf-dogs.  She accompanied the lady reporter of the "Kansas City\r\nStar" when photographs were taken of his Bonanza properties, and watched\r\nthe genesis of a six-column article.  At that time they were dined\r\nroyally in Flossie\'s cabin, on Flossie\'s table linen.  Likewise there\r\nwere comings and goings, and junketings, all perfectly proper, by the\r\nway, which caused the men to say sharp things and the women to be\r\nspiteful.  Only Mrs. Eppingwell did not hear.  The distant hum of wagging\r\ntongues rose faintly, but she was prone to believe good of people and to\r\nclose her ears to evil; so she paid no heed.\r\n\r\nNot so with Freda.  She had no cause to love men, but, by some strange\r\nalchemy of her nature, her heart went out to women,--to women whom she\r\nhad less cause to love.  And her heart went out to Flossie, even then\r\ntravelling the Long Trail and facing into the bitter North to meet a man\r\nwho might not wait for her.  A shrinking, clinging sort of a girl, Freda\r\npictured her, with weak mouth and pretty pouting lips, blow-away\r\nsun-kissed hair, and eyes full of the merry shallows and the lesser joys\r\nof life.  But she also pictured Flossie, face nose-strapped and frost-\r\nrimed, stumbling wearily behind the dogs.  Wherefore she smiled, dancing\r\none night, upon Floyd Vanderlip.\r\n\r\nFew men are so constituted that they may receive the smile of Freda\r\nunmoved; nor among them can Floyd Vanderlip be accounted.  The grace he\r\nhad found with the model-woman had caused him to re-measure himself, and\r\nby the favor in which he now stood with the Greek dancer he felt himself\r\ndoubly a man.  There were unknown qualities and depths in him, evidently,\r\nwhich they perceived.  He did not know exactly what those qualities and\r\ndepths were, but he had a hazy idea that they were there somewhere, and\r\nof them was bred a great pride in himself.  A man who could force two\r\nwomen such as these to look upon him a second time, was certainly a most\r\nremarkable man.  Some day, when he had the time, he would sit down and\r\nanalyze his strength; but now, just now, he would take what the gods had\r\ngiven him.  And a thin little thought began to lift itself, and he fell\r\nto wondering whatever under the sun he had seen in Flossie, and to regret\r\nexceedingly that he had sent for her.  Of course, Freda was out of the\r\nrunning.  His dumps were the richest on Bonanza Creek, and they were\r\nmany, while he was a man of responsibility and position.  But Loraine\r\nLisznayi--she was just the woman.  Her life had been large; she could do\r\nthe honors of his establishment and give tone to his dollars.\r\n\r\nBut Freda smiled, and continued to smile, till he came to spend much time\r\nwith her.  When she, too, rode down the street behind his wolf-dogs, the\r\nmodel-woman found food for thought, and the next time they were together\r\ndazzled him with her princes and cardinals and personal little anecdotes\r\nof courts and kings.  She also showed him dainty missives, superscribed,\r\n"My dear Loraine," and ended "Most affectionately yours," and signed by\r\nthe given name of a real live queen on a throne.  And he marvelled in his\r\nheart that the great woman should deign to waste so much as a moment upon\r\nhim.  But she played him cleverly, making flattering contrasts and\r\ncomparisons between him and the noble phantoms she drew mainly from her\r\nfancy, till he went away dizzy with self-delight and sorrowing for the\r\nworld which had been denied him so long.  Freda was a more masterful\r\nwoman.  If she flattered, no one knew it.  Should she stoop, the stoop\r\nwere unobserved.  If a man felt she thought well of him, so subtly was\r\nthe feeling conveyed that he could not for the life of him say why or\r\nhow.  So she tightened her grip upon Floyd Vanderlip and rode daily\r\nbehind his dogs.\r\n\r\nAnd just here is where the mistake occurred.  The buzz rose loudly and\r\nmore definitely, coupled now with the name of the dancer, and Mrs.\r\nEppingwell heard.  She, too, thought of Flossie lifting her moccasined\r\nfeet through the endless hours, and Floyd Vanderlip was invited up the\r\nhillside to tea, and invited often.  This quite took his breath away, and\r\nhe became drunken with appreciation of himself.  Never was man so\r\nmaltreated.  His soul had become a thing for which three women struggled,\r\nwhile a fourth was on the way to claim it.  And three such women!\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Eppingwell and the mistake she made.  She spoke of the affair,\r\ntentatively, to Sitka Charley, who had sold dogs to the Greek girl.  But\r\nno names were mentioned.  The nearest approach to it was when Mrs.\r\nEppingwell said, "This--er--horrid woman," and Sitka Charley, with the\r\nmodel-woman strong in his thoughts, had echoed, "--er--horrid woman."  And\r\nhe agreed with her, that it was a wicked thing for a woman to come\r\nbetween a man and the girl he was to marry.  "A mere girl, Charley," she\r\nsaid, "I am sure she is.  And she is coming into a strange country\r\nwithout a friend when she gets here.  We must do something."  Sitka\r\nCharley promised his help, and went away thinking what a wicked woman\r\nthis Loraine Lisznayi must be, also what noble women Mrs. Eppingwell and\r\nFreda were to interest themselves in the welfare of the unknown Flossie.\r\n\r\nNow Mrs. Eppingwell was open as the day.  To Sitka Charley, who took her\r\nonce past the Hills of Silence, belongs the glory of having memorialized\r\nher clear-searching eyes, her clear-ringing voice, and her utter\r\ndownright frankness.  Her lips had a way of stiffening to command, and\r\nshe was used to coming straight to the point.  Having taken Floyd\r\nVanderlip\'s measurement, she did not dare this with him; but she was not\r\nafraid to go down into the town to Freda.  And down she went, in the\r\nbright light of day, to the house of the dancer.  She was above silly\r\ntongues, as was her husband, the captain.  She wished to see this woman\r\nand to speak with her, nor was she aware of any reason why she should\r\nnot.  So she stood in the snow at the Greek girl\'s door, with the frost\r\nat sixty below, and parleyed with the waiting-maid for a full five\r\nminutes.  She had also the pleasure of being turned away from that door,\r\nand of going back up the hill, wroth at heart for the indignity which had\r\nbeen put upon her.  "Who was this woman that she should refuse to see\r\nher?" she asked herself.  One would think it the other way around, and\r\nshe herself but a dancing girl denied at the door of the wife of a\r\ncaptain.  As it was, she knew, had Freda come up the hill to her,--no\r\nmatter what the errand,--she would have made her welcome at her fire, and\r\nthey would have sat there as two women, and talked, merely as two women.\r\nShe had overstepped convention and lowered herself, but she had thought\r\nit different with the women down in the town.  And she was ashamed that\r\nshe had laid herself open to such dishonor, and her thoughts of Freda\r\nwere unkind.\r\n\r\nNot that Freda deserved this.  Mrs. Eppingwell had descended to meet her\r\nwho was without caste, while she, strong in the traditions of her own\r\nearlier status, had not permitted it.  She could worship such a woman,\r\nand she would have asked no greater joy than to have had her into the\r\ncabin and sat with her, just sat with her, for an hour.  But her respect\r\nfor Mrs. Eppingwell, and her respect for herself, who was beyond respect,\r\nhad prevented her doing that which she most desired.  Though not quite\r\nrecovered from the recent visit of Mrs. McFee, the wife of the minister,\r\nwho had descended upon her in a whirlwind of exhortation and brimstone,\r\nshe could not imagine what had prompted the present visit.  She was not\r\naware of any particular wrong she had done, and surely this woman who\r\nwaited at the door was not concerned with the welfare of her soul.  Why\r\nhad she come?  For all the curiosity she could not help but feel, she\r\nsteeled herself in the pride of those who are without pride, and trembled\r\nin the inner room like a maid on the first caress of a lover.  If Mrs.\r\nEppingwell suffered going up the hill, she too suffered, lying face\r\ndownward on the bed, dry-eyed, dry-mouthed, dumb.\r\n\r\nMrs. Eppingwell\'s knowledge of human nature was great.  She aimed at\r\nuniversality.  She had found it easy to step from the civilized and\r\ncontemplate things from the barbaric aspect.  She could comprehend\r\ncertain primal and analogous characteristics in a hungry wolf-dog or a\r\nstarving man, and predicate lines of action to be pursued by either under\r\nlike conditions.  To her, a woman was a woman, whether garbed in purple\r\nor the rags of the gutter; Freda was a woman.  She would not have been\r\nsurprised had she been taken into the dancer\'s cabin and encountered on\r\ncommon ground; nor surprised had she been taken in and flaunted in\r\nprideless arrogance.  But to be treated as she had been treated, was\r\nunexpected and disappointing.  Ergo, she had not caught Freda\'s point of\r\nview.  And this was good.  There are some points of view which cannot be\r\ngained save through much travail and personal crucifixion, and it were\r\nwell for the world that its Mrs. Eppingwells should, in certain ways,\r\nfall short of universality.  One cannot understand defilement without\r\nlaying hands to pitch, which is very sticky, while there be plenty\r\nwilling to undertake the experiment.  All of which is of small concern,\r\nbeyond the fact that it gave Mrs. Eppingwell ground for grievance, and\r\nbred for her a greater love in the Greek girl\'s heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd in this way things went along for a month,--Mrs. Eppingwell striving\r\nto withhold the man from the Greek dancer\'s blandishments against the\r\ntime of Flossie\'s coming; Flossie lessening the miles each day on the\r\ndreary trail; Freda pitting her strength against the model-woman; the\r\nmodel-woman straining every nerve to land the prize; and the man moving\r\nthrough it all like a flying shuttle, very proud of himself, whom he\r\nbelieved to be a second Don Juan.\r\n\r\nIt was nobody\'s fault except the man\'s that Loraine Lisznayi at last\r\nlanded him.  The way of a man with a maid may be too wonderful to know,\r\nbut the way of a woman with a man passeth all conception; whence the\r\nprophet were indeed unwise who would dare forecast Floyd Vanderlip\'s\r\ncourse twenty-four hours in advance.  Perhaps the model-woman\'s\r\nattraction lay in that to the eye she was a handsome animal; perhaps she\r\nfascinated him with her old-world talk of palaces and princes; leastwise\r\nshe dazzled him whose life had been worked out in uncultured roughness,\r\nand he at last agreed to her suggestion of a run down the river and a\r\nmarriage at Forty Mile.  In token of his intention he bought dogs from\r\nSitka Charley,--more than one sled is necessary when a woman like Loraine\r\nLisznayi takes to the trail, and then went up the creek to give orders\r\nfor the superintendence of his Bonanza mines during his absence.\r\n\r\nHe had given it out, rather vaguely, that he needed the animals for\r\nsledding lumber from the mill to his sluices, and right here is where\r\nSitka Charley demonstrated his fitness.  He agreed to furnish dogs on a\r\ngiven date, but no sooner had Floyd Vanderlip turned his toes up-creek,\r\nthan Charley hied himself away in perturbation to Loraine Lisznayi.  Did\r\nshe know where Mr. Vanderlip had gone?  He had agreed to supply that\r\ngentleman with a big string of dogs by a certain time; but that shameless\r\none, the German trader Meyers, had been buying up the brutes and skimped\r\nthe market.  It was very necessary he should see Mr. Vanderlip, because\r\nof the shameless one he would be all of a week behindhand in filling the\r\ncontract.  She did know where he had gone?  Up-creek?  Good!  He would\r\nstrike out after him at once and inform him of the unhappy delay.  Did he\r\nunderstand her to say that Mr. Vanderlip needed the dogs on Friday night?\r\nthat he must have them by that time?  It was too bad, but it was the\r\nfault of the shameless one who had bid up the prices.  They had jumped\r\nfifty dollars per head, and should he buy on the rising market he would\r\nlose by the contract.  He wondered if Mr. Vanderlip would be willing to\r\nmeet the advance.  She knew he would?  Being Mr. Vanderlip\'s friend, she\r\nwould even meet the difference herself?  And he was to say nothing about\r\nit?  She was kind to so look to his interests.  Friday night, did she\r\nsay?  Good!  The dogs would be on hand.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, Freda knew the elopement was to be pulled off on Friday\r\nnight; also, that Floyd Vanderlip had gone up-creek, and her hands were\r\ntied.  On Friday morning, Devereaux, the official courier, bearing\r\ndespatches from the Governor, arrived over the ice.  Besides the\r\ndespatches, he brought news of Flossie.  He had passed her camp at Sixty\r\nMile; humans and dogs were in good condition; and she would doubtless be\r\nin on the morrow.  Mrs. Eppingwell experienced a great relief on hearing\r\nthis; Floyd Vanderlip was safe up-creek, and ere the Greek girl could\r\nagain lay hands upon him, his bride would be on the ground.  But that\r\nafternoon her big St. Bernard, valiantly defending her front stoop, was\r\ndowned by a foraging party of trail-starved Malemutes.  He was buried\r\nbeneath the hirsute mass for about thirty seconds, when rescued by a\r\ncouple of axes and as many stout men.  Had he remained down two minutes,\r\nthe chances were large that he would have been roughly apportioned and\r\ncarried away in the respective bellies of the attacking party; but as it\r\nwas, it was a mere case of neat and expeditious mangling.  Sitka Charley\r\ncame to repair the damages, especially a right fore-paw which had\r\ninadvertently been left a fraction of a second too long in some other\r\ndog\'s mouth.  As he put on his mittens to go, the talk turned upon\r\nFlossie and in natural sequence passed on to the--"er horrid woman."\r\nSitka Charley remarked incidentally that she intended jumping out down\r\nriver that night with Floyd Vanderlip, and further ventured the\r\ninformation that accidents were very likely at that time of year.\r\n\r\nSo Mrs. Eppingwell\'s thoughts of Freda were unkinder than ever.  She\r\nwrote a note, addressed it to the man in question, and intrusted it to a\r\nmessenger who lay in wait at the mouth of Bonanza Creek.  Another man,\r\nbearing a note from Freda, also waited at that strategic point.  So it\r\nhappened that Floyd Vanderlip, riding his sled merrily down with the last\r\ndaylight, received the notes together.  He tore Freda\'s across.  No, he\r\nwould not go to see her.  There were greater things afoot that night.\r\nBesides, she was out of the running.  But Mrs. Eppingwell!  He would\r\nobserve her last wish,--or rather, the last wish it would be possible for\r\nhim to observe,--and meet her at the Governor\'s ball to hear what she had\r\nto say.  From the tone of the writing it was evidently important;\r\nperhaps-- He smiled fondly, but failed to shape the thought.  Confound it\r\nall, what a lucky fellow he was with the women any way!  Scattering her\r\nletter to the frost, he _mushed_ the dogs into a swinging lope and headed\r\nfor his cabin.  It was to be a masquerade, and he had to dig up the\r\ncostume used at the Opera House a couple of months before.  Also, he had\r\nto shave and to eat.  Thus it was that he, alone of all interested, was\r\nunaware of Flossie\'s proximity.\r\n\r\n"Have them down to the water-hole off the hospital, at midnight, sharp.\r\nDon\'t fail me," he said to Sitka Charley, who dropped in with the advice\r\nthat only one dog was lacking to fill the bill, and that that one would\r\nbe forthcoming in an hour or so.  "Here\'s the sack.  There\'s the scales.\r\nWeigh out your own dust and don\'t bother me.  I\'ve got to get ready for\r\nthe ball."\r\n\r\nSitka Charley weighed out his pay and departed, carrying with him a\r\nletter to Loraine Lisznayi, the contents of which he correctly imagined\r\nto refer to a meeting at the water-hole of the hospital, at midnight,\r\nsharp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nTwice Freda sent messengers up to the Barracks, where the dance was in\r\nfull swing, and as often they came back without answers.  Then she did\r\nwhat only Freda could do--put on her furs, masked her face, and went up\r\nherself to the Governor\'s ball.  Now there happened to be a custom--not\r\nan original one by any means--to which the official clique had long since\r\nbecome addicted.  It was a very wise custom, for it furnished protection\r\nto the womankind of the officials and gave greater selectness to their\r\nrevels.  Whenever a masquerade was given, a committee was chosen, the\r\nsole function of which was to stand by the door and peep beneath each and\r\nevery mask.  Most men did not clamor to be placed upon this committee,\r\nwhile the very ones who least desired the honor were the ones whose\r\nservices were most required.  The chaplain was not well enough acquainted\r\nwith the faces and places of the townspeople to know whom to admit and\r\nwhom to turn away.  In like condition were the several other worthy\r\ngentlemen who would have asked nothing better than to so serve.  To fill\r\nthe coveted place, Mrs. McFee would have risked her chance of salvation,\r\nand did, one night, when a certain trio passed in under her guns and\r\nmuddled things considerably before their identity was discovered.\r\nThereafter only the fit were chosen, and very ungracefully did they\r\nrespond.\r\n\r\nOn this particular night Prince was at the door.  Pressure had been\r\nbrought to bear, and he had not yet recovered from amaze at his having\r\nconsented to undertake a task which bid fair to lose him half his\r\nfriends, merely for the sake of pleasing the other half.  Three or four\r\nof the men he had refused were men whom he had known on creek and\r\ntrail,--good comrades, but not exactly eligible for so select an affair.\r\nHe was canvassing the expediency of resigning the post there and then,\r\nwhen a woman tripped in under the light.  Freda!  He could swear it by\r\nthe furs, did he not know that poise of head so well.  The last one to\r\nexpect in all the world.  He had given her better judgment than to thus\r\nventure the ignominy of refusal, or, if she passed, the scorn of women.\r\nHe shook his head, without scrutiny; he knew her too well to be mistaken.\r\nBut she pressed closer.  She lifted the black silk ribbon and as quickly\r\nlowered it again.  For one flashing, eternal second he looked upon her\r\nface.  It was not for nothing, the saying which had arisen in the\r\ncountry, that Freda played with men as a child with bubbles.  Not a word\r\nwas spoken.  Prince stepped aside, and a few moments later might have\r\nbeen seen resigning, with warm incoherence, the post to which he had been\r\nunfaithful.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nA woman, flexible of form, slender, yet rhythmic of strength in every\r\nmovement, now pausing with this group, now scanning that, urged a\r\nrestless and devious course among the revellers.  Men recognized the\r\nfurs, and marvelled,--men who should have served upon the door committee;\r\nbut they were not prone to speech.  Not so with the women.  They had\r\nbetter eyes for the lines of figure and tricks of carriage, and they knew\r\nthis form to be one with which they were unfamiliar; likewise the furs.\r\nMrs. McFee, emerging from the supper-room where all was in readiness,\r\ncaught one flash of the blazing, questing eyes through the silken mask-\r\nslits, and received a start.  She tried to recollect where she had seen\r\nthe like, and a vivid picture was recalled of a certain proud and\r\nrebellious sinner whom she had once encountered on a fruitless errand for\r\nthe Lord.\r\n\r\nSo it was that the good woman took the trail in hot and righteous wrath,\r\na trail which brought her ultimately into the company of Mrs. Eppingwell\r\nand Floyd Vanderlip.  Mrs. Eppingwell had just found the opportunity to\r\ntalk with the man.  She had determined, now that Flossie was so near at\r\nhand, to proceed directly to the point, and an incisive little ethical\r\ndiscourse was titillating on the end of her tongue, when the couple\r\nbecame three.  She noted, and pleasurably, the faintly foreign accent of\r\nthe "Beg pardon" with which the furred woman prefaced her immediate\r\nappropriation of Floyd Vanderlip; and she courteously bowed her\r\npermission for them to draw a little apart.\r\n\r\nThen it was that Mrs. McFee\'s righteous hand descended, and accompanying\r\nit in its descent was a black mask torn from a startled woman.  A\r\nwonderful face and brilliant eyes were exposed to the quiet curiosity of\r\nthose who looked that way, and they were everybody.  Floyd Vanderlip was\r\nrather confused.  The situation demanded instant action on the part of a\r\nman who was not beyond his depth, while _he_ hardly knew where he was.  He\r\nstared helplessly about him.  Mrs. Eppingwell was perplexed.  She could\r\nnot comprehend.  An explanation was forthcoming, somewhere, and Mrs.\r\nMcFee was equal to it.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Eppingwell," and her Celtic voice rose shrilly, "it is with great\r\npleasure I make you acquainted with Freda Moloof, _Miss_ Freda Moloof, as\r\nI understand."\r\n\r\nFreda involuntarily turned.  With her own face bared, she felt as in a\r\ndream, naked, upon her turned the clothed features and gleaming eyes of\r\nthe masked circle.  It seemed, almost, as though a hungry wolf-pack\r\ngirdled her, ready to drag her down.  It might chance that some felt pity\r\nfor her, she thought, and at the thought, hardened.  She would by far\r\nprefer their scorn.  Strong of heart was she, this woman, and though she\r\nhad hunted the prey into the midst of the pack, Mrs. Eppingwell or no\r\nMrs. Eppingwell, she could not forego the kill.\r\n\r\nBut here Mrs. Eppingwell did a strange thing.  So this, at last, was\r\nFreda, she mused, the dancer and the destroyer of men; the woman from\r\nwhose door she had been turned.  And she, too, felt the imperious\r\ncreature\'s nakedness as though it were her own.  Perhaps it was this, her\r\nSaxon disinclination to meet a disadvantaged foe, perhaps, forsooth, that\r\nit might give her greater strength in the struggle for the man, and it\r\nmight have been a little of both; but be that as it may, she did do this\r\nstrange thing.  When Mrs. McFee\'s thin voice, vibrant with malice, had\r\nraised, and Freda turned involuntarily, Mrs. Eppingwell also turned,\r\nremoved her mask, and inclined her head in acknowledgment.\r\n\r\nIt was another flashing, eternal second, during which these two women\r\nregarded each other.  The one, eyes blazing, meteoric; at bay,\r\naggressive; suffering in advance and resenting in advance the scorn and\r\nridicule and insult she had thrown herself open to; a beautiful, burning,\r\nbubbling lava cone of flesh and spirit.  And the other, calm-eyed, cool-\r\nbrowed, serene; strong in her own integrity, with faith in herself,\r\nthoroughly at ease; dispassionate, imperturbable; a figure chiselled from\r\nsome cold marble quarry.  Whatever gulf there might exist, she recognized\r\nit not.  No bridging, no descending; her attitude was that of perfect\r\nequality.  She stood tranquilly on the ground of their common womanhood.\r\nAnd this maddened Freda.  Not so, had she been of lesser breed; but her\r\nsoul\'s plummet knew not the bottomless, and she could follow the other\r\ninto the deeps of her deepest depths and read her aright.  "Why do you\r\nnot draw back your garment\'s hem?" she was fain to cry out, all in that\r\nflashing, dazzling second.  "Spit upon me, revile me, and it were greater\r\nmercy than this!"  She trembled.  Her nostrils distended and quivered.\r\nBut she drew herself in check, returned the inclination of head, and\r\nturned to the man.\r\n\r\n"Come with me, Floyd," she said simply.  "I want you now."\r\n\r\n"What the--" he began explosively, and quit as suddenly, discreet enough\r\nto not round it off.  Where the deuce had his wits gone, anyway?  Was\r\never a man more foolishly placed?  He gurgled deep down in his throat and\r\nhigh up in the roof of his mouth, heaved as one his big shoulders and his\r\nindecision, and glared appealingly at the two women.\r\n\r\n"I beg pardon, just a moment, but may I speak first with Mr. Vanderlip?"\r\nMrs. Eppingwell\'s voice, though flute-like and low, predicated will in\r\nits every cadence.\r\n\r\nThe man looked his gratitude.  He, at least, was willing enough.\r\n\r\n"I\'m very sorry," from Freda.  "There isn\'t time.  He must come at once."\r\nThe conventional phrases dropped easily from her lips, but she could not\r\nforbear to smile inwardly at their inadequacy and weakness.  She would\r\nmuch rather have shrieked.\r\n\r\n"But, Miss Moloof, who are you that you may possess yourself of Mr.\r\nVanderlip and command his actions?"\r\n\r\nWhereupon relief brightened his face, and the man beamed his approval.\r\nTrust Mrs. Eppingwell to drag him clear.  Freda had met her match this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n"I--I--" Freda hesitated, and then her feminine mind putting on its\r\nharness--"and who are you to ask this question?"\r\n\r\n"I?  I am Mrs. Eppingwell, and--"\r\n\r\n"There!" the other broke in sharply.  "You are the wife of a captain, who\r\nis therefore your husband.  I am only a dancing girl.  What do you with\r\nthis man?"\r\n\r\n"Such unprecedented behavior!" Mrs. McFee ruffled herself and cleared for\r\naction, but Mrs. Eppingwell shut her mouth with a look and developed a\r\nnew attack.\r\n\r\n"Since Miss Moloof appears to hold claims upon you, Mr. Vanderlip, and is\r\nin too great haste to grant me a few seconds of your time, I am forced to\r\nappeal directly to you.  May I speak with you, alone, and now?"\r\n\r\nMrs. McFee\'s jaws brought together with a snap.  That settled the\r\ndisgraceful situation.\r\n\r\n"Why, er--that is, certainly," the man stammered.  "Of course, of\r\ncourse," growing more effusive at the prospect of deliverance.\r\n\r\nMen are only gregarious vertebrates, domesticated and evolved, and the\r\nchances are large that it was because the Greek girl had in her time\r\ndealt with wilder masculine beasts of the human sort; for she turned upon\r\nthe man with hell\'s tides aflood in her blazing eyes, much as a\r\nbespangled lady upon a lion which has suddenly imbibed the pernicious\r\ntheory that he is a free agent.  The beast in him fawned to the lash.\r\n\r\n"That is to say, ah, afterward.  To-morrow, Mrs. Eppingwell; yes,\r\nto-morrow.  That is what I meant."  He solaced himself with the fact,\r\nshould he remain, that more embarrassment awaited.  Also, he had an\r\nengagement which he must keep shortly, down by the water-hole off the\r\nhospital.  Ye gods! he had never given Freda credit!  Wasn\'t she\r\nmagnificent!\r\n\r\n"I\'ll thank you for my mask, Mrs. McFee."\r\n\r\nThat lady, for the nonce speechless, turned over the article in question.\r\n\r\n"Good-night, Miss Moloof."  Mrs. Eppingwell was royal even in defeat.\r\n\r\nFreda reciprocated, though barely downing the impulse to clasp the\r\nother\'s knees and beg forgiveness,--no, not forgiveness, but something,\r\nshe knew not what, but which she none the less greatly desired.\r\n\r\nThe man was for her taking his arm; but she had made her kill in the\r\nmidst of the pack, and that which led kings to drag their vanquished at\r\nthe chariot-tail, led her toward the door alone, Floyd Vanderlip close at\r\nheel and striving to re-establish his mental equilibrium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was bitter cold.  As the trail wound, a quarter of a mile brought them\r\nto the dancer\'s cabin, by which time her moist breath had coated her face\r\nfrostily, while his had massed his heavy mustache till conversation was\r\npainful.  By the greenish light of the aurora borealis, the quicksilver\r\nshowed itself frozen hard in the bulb of the thermometer which hung\r\noutside the door.  A thousand dogs, in pitiful chorus, wailed their\r\nancient wrongs and claimed mercy from the unheeding stars.  Not a breath\r\nof air was moving.  For them there was no shelter from the cold, no\r\nshrewd crawling to leeward in snug nooks.  The frost was everywhere, and\r\nthey lay in the open, ever and anon stretching their trail-stiffened\r\nmuscles and lifting the long wolf-howl.\r\n\r\nThey did not talk at first, the man and the woman.  While the maid helped\r\nFreda off with her wraps, Floyd Vanderlip replenished the fire; and by\r\nthe time the maid had withdrawn to an inner room, his head over the\r\nstove, he was busily thawing out his burdened upper lip.  After that he\r\nrolled a cigarette and watched her lazily through the fragrant eddies.\r\nShe stole a glance at the clock.  It lacked half an hour of midnight.  How\r\nwas she to hold him?  Was he angry for that which she had done?  What was\r\nhis mood?  What mood of hers could meet his best?  Not that she doubted\r\nherself.  No, no.  Hold him she could, if need be at pistol point, till\r\nSitka Charley\'s work was done, and Devereaux\'s too.\r\n\r\nThere were many ways, and with her knowledge of this her contempt for the\r\nman increased.  As she leaned her head on her hand, a fleeting vision of\r\nher own girlhood, with its mournful climacteric and tragic ebb, was\r\nvouchsafed her, and for the moment she was minded to read him a lesson\r\nfrom it.  God! it must be less than human brute who could not be held by\r\nsuch a tale, told as she could tell it, but--bah!  He was not worth it,\r\nnor worth the pain to her.  The candle was positioned just right, and\r\neven as she thought of these things sacredly shameful to her, he was\r\npleasuring in the transparent pinkiness of her ear.  She noted his eye,\r\ntook the cue, and turned her head till the clean profile of the face was\r\npresented.  Not the least was that profile among her virtues.  She could\r\nnot help the lines upon which she had been builded, and they were very\r\ngood; but she had long since learned those lines, and though little they\r\nneeded, was not above advantaging them to the best of her ability.  The\r\ncandle began to flicker.  She could not do anything ungracefully, but\r\nthat did not prevent her improving upon nature a bit, when she reached\r\nforth and deftly snuffed the red wick from the midst of the yellow flame.\r\nAgain she rested head on hand, this time regarding the man thoughtfully,\r\nand any man is pleased when thus regarded by a pretty woman.\r\n\r\nShe was in little haste to begin.  If dalliance were to his liking, it\r\nwas to hers.  To him it was very comfortable, soothing his lungs with\r\nnicotine and gazing upon her.  It was snug and warm here, while down by\r\nthe water-hole began a trail which he would soon be hitting through the\r\nchilly hours.  He felt he ought to be angry with Freda for the scene she\r\nhad created, but somehow he didn\'t feel a bit wrathful.  Like as not\r\nthere wouldn\'t have been any scene if it hadn\'t been for that McFee\r\nwoman.  If he were the Governor, he would put a poll tax of a hundred\r\nounces a quarter upon her and her kind and all gospel sharks and sky\r\npilots.  And certainly Freda had behaved very ladylike, held her own with\r\nMrs. Eppingwell besides.  Never gave the girl credit for the grit.  He\r\nlooked lingeringly over her, coming back now and again to the eyes,\r\nbehind the deep earnestness of which he could not guess lay concealed a\r\ndeeper sneer.  And, Jove, wasn\'t she well put up!  Wonder why she looked\r\nat him so?  Did she want to marry him, too?  Like as not; but she wasn\'t\r\nthe only one.  Her looks were in her favor, weren\'t they?  And\r\nyoung--younger than Loraine Lisznayi.  She couldn\'t be more than twenty-\r\nthree or four, twenty-five at most.  And she\'d never get stout.  Anybody\r\ncould guess that the first time.  He couldn\'t say it of Loraine, though.\r\n_She_ certainly had put on flesh since the day she served as model.  Huh!\r\nonce he got her on trail he\'d take it off.  Put her on the snowshoes to\r\nbreak ahead of the dogs.  Never knew it to fail, yet.  But his thought\r\nleaped ahead to the palace under the lazy Mediterranean sky--and how\r\nwould it be with Loraine then?  No frost, no trail, no famine now and\r\nagain to cheer the monotony, and she getting older and piling it on with\r\nevery sunrise.  While this girl Freda--he sighed his unconscious regret\r\nthat he had missed being born under the flag of the Turk, and came back\r\nto Alaska.\r\n\r\n"Well?"  Both hands of the clock pointed perpendicularly to midnight, and\r\nit was high time he was getting down to the water-hole.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" Freda started, and she did it prettily, delighting him as his\r\nfellows have ever been delighted by their womankind.  When a man is made\r\nto believe that a woman, looking upon him thoughtfully, has lost herself\r\nin meditation over him, that man needs be an extremely cold-blooded\r\nindividual in order to trim his sheets, set a lookout, and steer clear.\r\n\r\n"I was just wondering what you wanted to see me about," he explained,\r\ndrawing his chair up to hers by the table.\r\n\r\n"Floyd," she looked him steadily in the eyes, "I am tired of the whole\r\nbusiness.  I want to go away.  I can\'t live it out here till the river\r\nbreaks.  If I try, I\'ll die.  I am sure of it.  I want to quit it all and\r\ngo away, and I want to do it at once."\r\n\r\nShe laid her hand in mute appeal upon the back of his, which turned over\r\nand became a prison.  Another one, he thought, just throwing herself at\r\nhim.  Guess it wouldn\'t hurt Loraine to cool her feet by the water-hole a\r\nlittle longer.\r\n\r\n"Well?"  This time from Freda, but softly and anxiously.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what to say," he hastened to answer, adding to himself that\r\nit was coming along quicker than he had expected.  "Nothing I\'d like\r\nbetter, Freda.  You know that well enough."  He pressed her hand, palm to\r\npalm.  She nodded.  Could she wonder that she despised the breed?\r\n\r\n"But you see, I--I\'m engaged.  Of course you know that.  And the girl\'s\r\ncoming into the country to marry me.  Don\'t know what was up with me when\r\nI asked her, but it was a long while back, and I was all-fired young--"\r\n\r\n"I want to go away, out of the land, anywhere," she went on, disregarding\r\nthe obstacle he had reared up and apologized for.  "I have been running\r\nover the men I know and reached the conclusion that--that--"\r\n\r\n"I was the likeliest of the lot?"\r\n\r\nShe smiled her gratitude for his having saved her the embarrassment of\r\nconfession.  He drew her head against his shoulder with the free hand,\r\nand somehow the scent of her hair got into his nostrils.  Then he\r\ndiscovered that a common pulse throbbed, throbbed, throbbed, where their\r\npalms were in contact.  This phenomenon is easily comprehensible from a\r\nphysiological standpoint, but to the man who makes the discovery for the\r\nfirst time, it is a most wonderful thing.  Floyd Vanderlip had caressed\r\nmore shovel-handles than women\'s hands in his time, so this was an\r\nexperience quite new and delightfully strange.  And when Freda turned her\r\nhead against his shoulder, her hair brushing his cheek till his eyes met\r\nhers, full and at close range, luminously soft, ay, and tender--why,\r\nwhose fault was it that he lost his grip utterly?  False to Flossie, why\r\nnot to Loraine?  Even if the women did keep bothering him, that was no\r\nreason he should make up his mind in a hurry.  Why, he had slathers of\r\nmoney, and Freda was just the girl to grace it.  A wife she\'d make him\r\nfor other men to envy.  But go slow.  He must be cautious.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t happen to care for palaces, do you?" he asked.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n"Well, I had a hankering after them myself, till I got to thinking, a\r\nwhile back, and I\'ve about sized it up that one\'d get fat living in\r\npalaces, and soft and lazy."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it\'s nice for a time, but you soon grow tired of it, I imagine,"\r\nshe hastened to reassure him.  "The world is good, but life should be\r\nmany-sided.  Rough and knock about for a while, and then rest up\r\nsomewhere.  Off to the South Seas on a yacht, then a nibble of Paris; a\r\nwinter in South America and a summer in Norway; a few months in England--"\r\n\r\n"Good society?"\r\n\r\n"Most certainly--the best; and then, heigho! for the dogs and sleds and\r\nthe Hudson Bay Country.  Change, you know.  A strong man like you, full\r\nof vitality and go, could not possibly stand a palace for a year.  It is\r\nall very well for effeminate men, but you weren\'t made for such a life.\r\nYou are masculine, intensely masculine."\r\n\r\n"Think so?"\r\n\r\n"It does not require thinking.  I know.  Have you ever noticed that it\r\nwas easy to make women care for you?"\r\n\r\nHis dubious innocence was superb.\r\n\r\n"It is very easy.  And why?  Because you are masculine.  You strike the\r\ndeepest chords of a woman\'s heart.  You are something to cling to,--big-\r\nmuscled, strong, and brave.  In short, because you _are_ a man."\r\n\r\nShe shot a glance at the clock.  It was half after the hour.  She had\r\ngiven a margin of thirty minutes to Sitka Charley; and it did not matter,\r\nnow, when Devereaux arrived.  Her work was done.  She lifted her head,\r\nlaughed her genuine mirth, slipped her hand clear, and rising to her feet\r\ncalled the maid.\r\n\r\n"Alice, help Mr. Vanderlip on with his _parka_.  His mittens are on the\r\nsill by the stove."\r\n\r\nThe man could not understand.\r\n\r\n"Let me thank you for your kindness, Floyd.  Your time was invaluable to\r\nme, and it was indeed good of you.  The turning to the left, as you leave\r\nthe cabin, leads the quickest to the water-hole.  Good-night.  I am going\r\nto bed."\r\n\r\nFloyd Vanderlip employed strong words to express his perplexity and\r\ndisappointment.  Alice did not like to hear men swear, so dropped his\r\n_parka_ on the floor and tossed his mittens on top of it.  Then he made a\r\nbreak for Freda, and she ruined her retreat to the inner room by tripping\r\nover the _parka_.  He brought her up standing with a rude grip on the\r\nwrist.  But she only laughed.  She was not afraid of men.  Had they not\r\nwrought their worst with her, and did she not still endure?\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be rough," she said finally.  "On second thought," here she looked\r\nat his detaining hand, "I\'ve decided not to go to bed yet a while.  Do\r\nsit down and be comfortable instead of ridiculous.  Any questions?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my lady, and reckoning, too."  He still kept his hold.  "What do\r\nyou know about the water-hole?  What did you mean by--no, never mind.  One\r\nquestion at a time."\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing much.  Sitka Charley had an appointment there with somebody\r\nyou may know, and not being anxious for a man of your known charm to be\r\npresent, fell back upon me to kindly help him.  That\'s all.  They\'re off\r\nnow, and a good half hour ago."\r\n\r\n"Where?  Down river and without me?  And he an Indian!"\r\n\r\n"There\'s no accounting for taste, you know, especially in a woman."\r\n\r\n"But how do I stand in this deal?  I\'ve lost four thousand dollars\' worth\r\nof dogs and a tidy bit of a woman, and nothing to show for it.  Except\r\nyou," he added as an afterthought, "and cheap you are at the price."\r\n\r\nFreda shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n"You might as well get ready.  I\'m going out to borrow a couple of teams\r\nof dogs, and we\'ll start in as many hours."\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry, but I\'m going to bed."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll pack if you know what\'s good for you.  Go to bed, or not, when I\r\nget my dogs outside, so help me, onto the sled you go.  Mebbe you fooled\r\nwith me, but I\'ll just see your bluff and take you in earnest.  Hear me?"\r\n\r\nHe closed on her wrist till it hurt, but on her lips a smile was growing,\r\nand she seemed to listen intently to some outside sound.  There was a\r\njingle of dog bells, and a man\'s voice crying "Haw!" as a sled took the\r\nturning and drew up at the cabin.\r\n\r\n"_Now_ will you let me go to bed?"\r\n\r\nAs Freda spoke she threw open the door.  Into the warm room rushed the\r\nfrost, and on the threshold, garbed in trail-worn furs, knee-deep in the\r\nswirling vapor, against a background of flaming borealis, a woman\r\nhesitated.  She removed her nose-trap and stood blinking blindly in the\r\nwhite candlelight.  Floyd Vanderlip stumbled forward.\r\n\r\n"Floyd!" she cried, relieved and glad, and met him with a tired bound.\r\n\r\nWhat could he but kiss the armful of furs?  And a pretty armful it was,\r\nnestling against him wearily, but happy.\r\n\r\n"It was good of you," spoke the armful, "to send Mr. Devereaux with fresh\r\ndogs after me, else I would not have been in till to-morrow."\r\n\r\nThe man looked blankly across at Freda, then the light breaking in upon\r\nhim, "And wasn\'t it good of Devereaux to go?"\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t wait a bit longer, could you, dear?"  Flossie snuggled closer.\r\n\r\n"Well, I was getting sort of impatient," he confessed glibly, at the same\r\ntime drawing her up till her feet left the floor, and getting outside the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThat same night an inexplicable thing happened to the Reverend James\r\nBrown, missionary, who lived among the natives several miles down the\r\nYukon and saw to it that the trails they trod led to the white man\'s\r\nparadise.  He was roused from his sleep by a strange Indian, who gave\r\ninto his charge not only the soul but the body of a woman, and having\r\ndone this drove quickly away.  This woman was heavy, and handsome, and\r\nangry, and in her wrath unclean words fell from her mouth.  This shocked\r\nthe worthy man, but he was yet young and her presence would have been\r\npernicious (in the simple eyes of his flock), had she not struck out on\r\nfoot for Dawson with the first gray of dawn.\r\n\r\nThe shock to Dawson came many days later, when the summer had come and\r\nthe population honored a certain royal lady at Windsor by lining the\r\nYukon\'s bank and watching Sitka Charley rise up with flashing paddle and\r\ndrive the first canoe across the line.  On this day of the races, Mrs.\r\nEppingwell, who had learned and unlearned numerous things, saw Freda for\r\nthe first time since the night of the ball.  "Publicly, mind you," as\r\nMrs. McFee expressed it, "without regard or respect for the morals of the\r\ncommunity," she went up to the dancer and held out her hand.  At first,\r\nit is remembered by those who saw, the girl shrank back, then words\r\npassed between the two, and Freda, great Freda, broke down and wept on\r\nthe shoulder of the captain\'s wife.  It was not given to Dawson to know\r\nwhy Mrs. Eppingwell should crave forgiveness of a Greek dancing girl, but\r\nshe did it publicly, and it was unseemly.\r\n\r\nIt were well not to forget Mrs. McFee.  She took a cabin passage on the\r\nfirst steamer going out.  She also took with her a theory which she had\r\nachieved in the silent watches of the long dark nights; and it is her\r\nconviction that the Northland is unregenerate because it is so cold\r\nthere.  Fear of hell-fire cannot be bred in an ice-box.  This may appear\r\ndogmatic, but it is Mrs. McFee\'s theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE GOD OF HIS FATHERS***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 1655.txt or 1655.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/6/5/1655\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit:\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
