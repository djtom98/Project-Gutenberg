At least if you count the\r\nChicago flat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo we had--you wonder!\xe2\x80\x9d He laid his hand on hers, and his touch renewed\r\nthe sense of marvelling exultation which the deliberate survey of their\r\nadventure always roused in her.... It was characteristic that she merely\r\nadded, in her steady laughing tone: \xe2\x80\x9cOr, not counting the flat--for\r\nI hate to brag--just consider the others: Violet Melrose\xe2\x80\x99s place at\r\nVersailles, your aunt\xe2\x80\x99s villa at Monte Carlo--and a moor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was conscious of throwing in the moor tentatively, and yet with\r\na somewhat exaggerated emphasis, as if to make sure that he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\naccuse her of slurring it over. But he seemed to have no desire to\r\ndo so. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor old Fred!\xe2\x80\x9d he merely remarked; and she breathed out\r\ncarelessly: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, well--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis hand still lay on hers, and for a long interval, while they stood\r\nsilent in the enveloping loveliness of the night, she was aware only of\r\nthe warm current running from palm to palm, as the moonlight below them\r\ndrew its line of magic from shore to shore.\r\n\r\nNick Lansing spoke at last. \xe2\x80\x9cVersailles in May would have been\r\nimpossible: all our Paris crowd would have run us down within\r\ntwenty-four hours. And Monte Carlo is ruled out because it\xe2\x80\x99s exactly\r\nthe kind of place everybody expected us to go. So--with all respect to\r\nyou--it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much of a mental strain to decide on Como.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis wife instantly challenged this belittling of her capacity. \xe2\x80\x9cIt took\r\na good deal of argument to convince you that we could face the ridicule\r\nof Como!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I should have preferred something in a lower key; at least I\r\nthought I should till we got here. Now I see that this place is idiotic\r\nunless one is perfectly happy; and that then it\xe2\x80\x99s--as good as any other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sighed out a blissful assent. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I must say that Streffy has done\r\nthings to a turn. Even the cigars--who do you suppose gave him those\r\ncigars?\xe2\x80\x9d She added thoughtfully: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll miss them when we have to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I say, don\xe2\x80\x99t let\xe2\x80\x99s talk to-night about going. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t we outside of\r\ntime and space...? Smell that guinea-a-bottle stuff over there: what is\r\nit? Stephanotis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cY--yes.... I suppose so. Or gardenias.... Oh, the fire-flies! Look...\r\nthere, against that splash of moonlight on the water. Apples of silver\r\nin a net-work of gold....\xe2\x80\x9d They leaned together, one flesh from shoulder\r\nto finger-tips, their eyes held by the snared glitter of the ripples.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could bear,\xe2\x80\x9d Lansing remarked, \xe2\x80\x9ceven a nightingale at this\r\nmoment....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA faint gurgle shook the magnolias behind them, and a long liquid\r\nwhisper answered it from the thicket of laurel above their heads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a little late in the year for them: they\xe2\x80\x99re ending just as we\r\nbegin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope when our turn comes we shall say good-bye to each\r\nother as sweetly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s mind to answer: \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re not saying good-bye,\r\nbut only settling down to family cares.\xe2\x80\x9d But as this did not happen to\r\nbe in his plan, or in Susy\xe2\x80\x99s, he merely echoed her laugh and pressed her\r\ncloser.\r\n\r\nThe spring night drew them into its deepening embrace. The ripples of\r\nthe lake had gradually widened and faded into a silken smoothness, and\r\nhigh above the mountains the moon was turning from gold to white in\r\na sky powdered with vanishing stars. Across the lake the lights of a\r\nlittle town went out, one after another, and the distant shore became a\r\nfloating blackness. A breeze that rose and sank brushed their faces with\r\nthe scents of the garden; once it blew out over the water a great white\r\nmoth like a drifting magnolia petal. The nightingales had paused and the\r\ntrickle of the fountain behind the house grew suddenly insistent.\r\n\r\nWhen Susy spoke it was in a voice languid with visions. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been\r\nthinking,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we ought to be able to make it last at least\r\na year longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer husband received the remark without any sign of surprise or\r\ndisapprobation; his answer showed that he not only understood her, but\r\nhad been inwardly following the same train of thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean,\xe2\x80\x9d he enquired after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout counting your\r\ngrandmother\xe2\x80\x99s pearls?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--without the pearls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pondered a while, and then rejoined in a tender whisper: \xe2\x80\x9cTell me\r\nagain just how.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s sit down, then. No, I like the cushions best.\xe2\x80\x9d He stretched\r\nhimself in a long willow chair, and she curled up on a heap of\r\nboat-cushions and leaned her head against his knee. Just above her,\r\nwhen she lifted her lids, she saw bits of moon-flooded sky incrusted\r\nlike silver in a sharp black patterning of plane-boughs. All about them\r\nbreathed of peace and beauty and stability, and her happiness was so\r\nacute that it was almost a relief to remember the stormy background of\r\nbills and borrowing against which its frail structure had been reared.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople with a balance can\xe2\x80\x99t be as happy as all this,\xe2\x80\x9d Susy mused,\r\nletting the moonlight filter through her lazy lashes.\r\n\r\nPeople with a balance had always been Susy Branch\xe2\x80\x99s bugbear; they were\r\nstill, and more dangerously, to be Susy Lansing\xe2\x80\x99s. She detested them,\r\ndetested them doubly, as the natural enemies of mankind and as the\r\npeople one always had to put one\xe2\x80\x99s self out for. The greater part of her\r\nlife having been passed among them, she knew nearly all that there was\r\nto know about them, and judged them with the contemptuous lucidity\r\nof nearly twenty years of dependence. But at the present moment her\r\nanimosity was diminished not only by the softening effect of love but\r\nby the fact that she had got out of those very people more--yes, ever so\r\nmuch more--than she and Nick, in their hours of most reckless planning,\r\nhad ever dared to hope for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, we owe them this!\xe2\x80\x9d she mused.\r\n\r\nHer husband, lost in the drowsy beatitude of the hour, had not repeated\r\nhis question; but she was still on the trail of the thought he had\r\nstarted. A year--yes, she was sure now that with a little management\r\nthey could have a whole year of it! \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x9d was their marriage, their being\r\ntogether, and away from bores and bothers, in a comradeship of which\r\nboth of them had long ago guessed the immediate pleasure, but she at\r\nleast had never imagined the deeper harmony.\r\n\r\nIt was at one of their earliest meetings--at one of the heterogeneous\r\ndinners that the Fred Gillows tried to think \xe2\x80\x9cliterary\xe2\x80\x9d--that the young\r\nman who chanced to sit next to her, and of whom it was vaguely rumoured\r\nthat he had \xe2\x80\x9cwritten,\xe2\x80\x9d had presented himself to her imagination as the\r\nsort of luxury to which Susy Branch, heiress, might conceivably have\r\ntreated herself as a crowning folly. Susy Branch, pauper, was fond of\r\npicturing how this fancied double would employ her millions: it was one\r\nof her chief grievances against her rich friends that they disposed of\r\ntheirs so unimaginatively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather have a husband like that than a steam-yacht!\xe2\x80\x9d she had\r\nthought at the end of her talk with the young man who had written, and\r\nas to whom it had at once been clear to her that nothing his pen had\r\nproduced, or might hereafter set down, would put him in a position to\r\noffer his wife anything more costly than a row-boat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis wife! As if he could ever have one! For he\xe2\x80\x99s not the kind to marry\r\nfor a yacht either.\xe2\x80\x9d In spite of her past, Susy had preserved enough\r\ninner independence to detect the latent signs of it in others, and also\r\nto ascribe it impulsively to those of the opposite sex who happened to\r\ninterest her. She had a natural contempt for people who gloried in what\r\nthey need only have endured. She herself meant eventually to marry,\r\nbecause one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t forever hang on to rich people; but she was going\r\nto wait till she found some one who combined the maximum of wealth with\r\nat least a minimum of companionableness.\r\n\r\nShe had at once perceived young Lansing\xe2\x80\x99s case to be exactly the\r\nopposite: he was as poor as he could be, and as companionable as it was\r\npossible to imagine. She therefore decided to see as much of him as her\r\nhurried and entangled life permitted; and this, thanks to a series of\r\nadroit adjustments, turned out to be a good deal. They met frequently\r\nall the rest of that winter; so frequently that Mrs. Fred Gillow one\r\nday abruptly and sharply gave Susy to understand that she was \xe2\x80\x9cmaking\r\nherself ridiculous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh--\xe2\x80\x9d said Susy with a long breath, looking her friend and patroness\r\nstraight in the painted eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ursula Gillow in a sob, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore you interfered Nick liked\r\nme awfully... and, of course, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to reproach you... but when I\r\nthink....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy made no answer. How could she, when she thought? The dress she had\r\non had been given her by Ursula; Ursula\xe2\x80\x99s motor had carried her to the\r\nfeast from which they were both returning. She counted on spending the\r\nfollowing August with the Gillows at Newport... and the only alternative\r\nwas to go to California with the Bockheimers, whom she had hitherto\r\nrefused even to dine with.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, what you fancy is perfect nonsense, Ursula; and as to my\r\ninterfering--\xe2\x80\x9d Susy hesitated, and then murmured: \xe2\x80\x9cBut if it will make\r\nyou any happier I\xe2\x80\x99ll arrange to see him less often....\xe2\x80\x9d She sounded the\r\nlowest depths of subservience in returning Ursula\xe2\x80\x99s tearful kiss....\r\n\r\nSusy Branch had a masculine respect for her word; and the next day she\r\nput on her most becoming hat and sought out young Mr. Lansing in his\r\nlodgings. She was determined to keep her promise to Ursula; but she\r\nmeant to look her best when she did it.\r\n\r\nShe knew at what time the young man was likely to be found, for he was\r\ndoing a dreary job on a popular encyclopaedia (V to X), and had told her\r\nwhat hours were dedicated to the hateful task. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, if only it were a\r\nnovel!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought as she mounted his dingy stairs; but immediately\r\nreflected that, if it were the kind that she could bear to read, it\r\nprobably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring him in much more than his encyclopaedia. Miss\r\nBranch had her standards in literature....\r\n\r\nThe apartment to which Mr. Lansing admitted her was a good deal cleaner,\r\nbut hardly less dingy, than his staircase. Susy, knowing him to be\r\naddicted to Oriental archaeology, had pictured him in a bare room\r\nadorned by a single Chinese bronze of flawless shape, or by some\r\nprecious fragment of Asiatic pottery. But such redeeming features were\r\nconspicuously absent, and no attempt had been made to disguise the\r\ndecent indigence of the bed-sitting-room.\r\n\r\nLansing welcomed his visitor with every sign of pleasure, and with\r\napparent indifference as to what she thought of his furniture. He seemed\r\nto be conscious only of his luck in seeing her on a day when they had\r\nnot expected to meet. This made Susy all the sorrier to execute her\r\npromise, and the gladder that she had put on her prettiest hat; and for\r\na moment or two she looked at him in silence from under its conniving\r\nbrim.\r\n\r\nWarm as their mutual liking was, Lansing had never said a word of love\r\nto her; but this was no deterrent to his visitor, whose habit it was\r\nto speak her meaning clearly when there were no reasons, worldly or\r\npecuniary, for its concealment. After a moment, therefore, she told him\r\nwhy she had come; it was a nuisance, of course, but he would understand.\r\nUrsula Gillow was jealous, and they would have to give up seeing each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe young man\xe2\x80\x99s burst of laughter was music to her; for, after all, she\r\nhad been rather afraid that being devoted to Ursula might be as much in\r\nhis day\xe2\x80\x99s work as doing the encyclopaedia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I give you my word it\xe2\x80\x99s a raving-mad mistake! And I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe\r\nshe ever meant me, to begin with--\xe2\x80\x9d he protested; but Susy, her\r\ncommon-sense returning with her reassurance, promptly cut short his\r\ndenial.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can trust Ursula to make herself clear on such occasions. And it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any difference what you think. All that matters is what she\r\nbelieves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come! I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a word to say about that too, haven\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy looked slowly and consideringly about the room. There was nothing\r\nin it, absolutely nothing, to show that he had ever possessed a spare\r\ndollar--or accepted a present.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot as far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned,\xe2\x80\x9d she finally pronounced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean? If I\xe2\x80\x99m as free as air--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe grew thoughtful. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, then, of course--. It only seems a little odd,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he added drily, \xe2\x80\x9cthat in that case, the protest should have come from\r\nMrs. Gillow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstead of coming from my millionaire bridegroom, Oh, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any; in\r\nthat respect I\xe2\x80\x99m as free as you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then--? Haven\xe2\x80\x99t we only got to stay free?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy drew her brows together anxiously. It was going to be rather more\r\ndifficult than she had supposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said I was as free in that respect. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to marry--and I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you are?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod, no!\xe2\x80\x9d he ejaculated fervently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always imply complete freedom....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood just above her, leaning his elbow against the hideous black\r\nmarble arch that framed his fireless grate. As she glanced up she saw\r\nhis face harden, and the colour flew to hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas that what you came to tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand--and I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you don\xe2\x80\x99t, since we\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nknocked about so long among exactly the same kind of people.\xe2\x80\x9d She stood\r\nup impulsively and laid her hand on his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cI do wish you\xe2\x80\x99d help\r\nme--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe remained motionless, letting the hand lie untouched.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp you to tell me that poor Ursula was a pretext, but that there IS\r\nsomeone who--for one reason or another--really has a right to object to\r\nyour seeing me too often?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy laughed impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cYou talk like the hero of a novel--the kind\r\nmy governess used to read. In the first place I should never recognize\r\nthat kind of right, as you call it--never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what kind do you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked with a clearing brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy--the kind I suppose you recognize on the part of your publisher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n This evoked a hollow laugh from him. \xe2\x80\x9cA business claim, call it,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\npursued. \xe2\x80\x9cUrsula does a lot for me: I live on her for half the year.\r\nThis dress I\xe2\x80\x99ve got on now is one she gave me. Her motor is going to\r\ntake me to a dinner to-night. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to spend next summer with her\r\nat Newport.... If I don\xe2\x80\x99t, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go to California with the\r\nBockheimers--so good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly in tears, she was out of the door and down his steep three\r\nflights before he could stop her--though, in thinking it over, she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t even remember if he had tried to. She only recalled having stood\r\na long time on the corner of Fifth Avenue, in the harsh winter radiance,\r\nwaiting till a break in the torrent of motors laden with fashionable\r\nwomen should let her cross, and saying to herself: \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, I might\r\nhave promised Ursula... and kept on seeing him....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of which, when Lansing wrote the next day entreating a word with\r\nher, she had sent back a friendly but firm refusal; and had managed soon\r\nafterward to get taken to Canada for a fortnight\xe2\x80\x99s ski-ing, and then to\r\nFlorida for six weeks in a house-boat....\r\n\r\nAs she reached this point in her retrospect the remembrance of Florida\r\ncalled up a vision of moonlit waters, magnolia fragrance and balmy airs;\r\nmerging with the circumambient sweetness, it laid a drowsy spell upon\r\nher lids. Yes, there had been a bad moment: but it was over; and she was\r\nhere, safe and blissful, and with Nick; and this was his knee her head\r\nrested on, and they had a year ahead of them... a whole year.... \xe2\x80\x9cNot\r\ncounting the pearls,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, shutting her eyes....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLANSING threw the end of Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s expensive cigar into the lake, and\r\nbent over his wife. Poor child! She had fallen asleep.... He leaned\r\nback and stared up again at the silver-flooded sky. How queer--how\r\ninexpressibly queer--it was to think that that light was shed by his\r\nhoney-moon! A year ago, if anyone had predicted his risking such an\r\nadventure, he would have replied by asking to be locked up at the first\r\nsymptoms....\r\n\r\nThere was still no doubt in his mind that the adventure was a mad one.\r\nIt was all very well for Susy to remind him twenty times a day that they\r\nhad pulled it off--and so why should he worry? Even in the light of her\r\nfar-seeing cleverness, and of his own present bliss, he knew the future\r\nwould not bear the examination of sober thought. And as he sat there\r\nin the summer moonlight, with her head on his knee, he tried to\r\nrecapitulate the successive steps that had landed them on Streffy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlake-front.\r\n\r\nOn Lansing\xe2\x80\x99s side, no doubt, it dated back to his leaving Harvard with\r\nthe large resolve not to miss anything. There stood the evergreen Tree\r\nof Life, the Four Rivers flowing from its foot; and on every one of the\r\nfour currents he meant to launch his little skiff. On two of them he had\r\nnot gone very far, on the third he had nearly stuck in the mud; but the\r\nfourth had carried him to the very heart of wonder. It was the stream of\r\nhis lively imagination, of his inexhaustible interest in every form of\r\nbeauty and strangeness and folly. On this stream, sitting in the stout\r\nlittle craft of his poverty, his insignificance and his independence, he\r\nhad made some notable voyages.... And so, when Susy Branch, whom he had\r\nsought out through a New York season as the prettiest and most amusing\r\ngirl in sight, had surprised him with the contradictory revelation of\r\nher modern sense of expediency and her old-fashioned standard of good\r\nfaith, he had felt an irresistible desire to put off on one more cruise\r\ninto the unknown.\r\n\r\nIt was of the essence of the adventure that, after her one brief visit\r\nto his lodgings, he should have kept his promise and not tried to see\r\nher again. Even if her straightforwardness had not roused his emulation,\r\nhis understanding of her difficulties would have moved his pity. He knew\r\non how frail a thread the popularity of the penniless hangs, and how\r\nmiserably a girl like Susy was the sport of other people\xe2\x80\x99s moods and\r\nwhims. It was a part of his difficulty and of hers that to get what they\r\nliked they so often had to do what they disliked. But the keeping of his\r\npromise was a greater bore than he had expected. Susy Branch had become\r\na delightful habit in a life where most of the fixed things were\r\ndull, and her disappearance had made it suddenly clear to him that his\r\nresources were growing more and more limited. Much that had once amused\r\nhim hugely now amused him less, or not at all: a good part of his world\r\nof wonder had shrunk to a village peep-show. And the things which had\r\nkept their stimulating power--distant journeys, the enjoyment of art,\r\nthe contact with new scenes and strange societies--were becoming less\r\nand less attainable. Lansing had never had more than a pittance; he had\r\nspent rather too much of it in his first plunge into life, and the best\r\nhe could look forward to was a middle-age of poorly-paid hack-work,\r\nmitigated by brief and frugal holidays. He knew that he was more\r\nintelligent than the average, but he had long since concluded that\r\nhis talents were not marketable. Of the thin volume of sonnets which a\r\nfriendly publisher had launched for him, just seventy copies had been\r\nsold; and though his essay on \xe2\x80\x9cChinese Influences in Greek Art\xe2\x80\x9d had\r\ncreated a passing stir, it had resulted in controversial correspondence\r\nand dinner invitations rather than in more substantial benefits.\r\nThere seemed, in short, no prospect of his ever earning money, and his\r\nrestricted future made him attach an increasing value to the kind of\r\nfriendship that Susy Branch had given him. Apart from the pleasure of\r\nlooking at her and listening to her--of enjoying in her what others less\r\ndiscriminatingly but as liberally appreciated--he had the sense, between\r\nhimself and her, of a kind of free-masonry of precocious tolerance and\r\nirony. They had both, in early youth, taken the measure of the world\r\nthey happened to live in: they knew just what it was worth to them\r\nand for what reasons, and the community of these reasons lent to their\r\nintimacy its last exquisite touch. And now, because of some jealous whim\r\nof a dissatisfied fool of a woman, as to whom he felt himself no more to\r\nblame than any young man who has paid for good dinners by good manners,\r\nhe was to be deprived of the one complete companionship he had ever\r\nknown....\r\n\r\nHis thoughts travelled on. He recalled the long dull spring in New York\r\nafter his break with Susy, the weary grind on his last articles,\r\nhis listless speculations as to the cheapest and least boring way of\r\ndisposing of the summer; and then the amazing luck of going, reluctantly\r\nand at the last minute, to spend a Sunday with the poor Nat Fulmers, in\r\nthe wilds of New Hampshire, and of finding Susy there--Susy, whom he had\r\nnever even suspected of knowing anybody in the Fulmers\xe2\x80\x99 set!\r\n\r\nShe had behaved perfectly--and so had he--but they were obviously much\r\ntoo glad to see each other. And then it was unsettling to be with her in\r\nsuch a house as the Fulmers\xe2\x80\x99, away from the large setting of luxury\r\nthey were both used to, in the cramped cottage where their host had\r\nhis studio in the verandah, their hostess practiced her violin in the\r\ndining-room, and five ubiquitous children sprawled and shouted and blew\r\ntrumpets and put tadpoles in the water-jugs, and the mid-day dinner was\r\ntwo hours late--and proportionately bad--because the Italian cook was\r\nposing for Fulmer.\r\n\r\nLansing\xe2\x80\x99s first thought had been that meeting Susy in such circumstances\r\nwould be the quickest way to cure them both of their regrets. The case\r\nof the Fulmers was an awful object-lesson in what happened to young\r\npeople who lost their heads; poor Nat, whose pictures nobody bought, had\r\ngone to seed so terribly--and Grace, at twenty-nine, would never again be\r\nanything but the woman of whom people say, \xe2\x80\x9cI can remember her when she\r\nwas lovely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the devil of it was that Nat had never been such good company, or\r\nGrace so free from care and so full of music; and that, in spite of\r\ntheir disorder and dishevelment, and the bad food and general crazy\r\ndiscomfort, there was more amusement to be got out of their society\r\nthan out of the most opulently staged house-party through which Susy and\r\nLansing had ever yawned their way.\r\n\r\nIt was almost a relief to the young man when, on the second afternoon,\r\nMiss Branch drew him into the narrow hall to say: \xe2\x80\x9cI really can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstand the combination of Grace\xe2\x80\x99s violin and little Nat\xe2\x80\x99s motor-horn any\r\nlonger. Do let us slip out till the duet is over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do they stand it, I wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d he basely echoed, as he followed her\r\nup the wooded path behind the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might be worth finding out,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined with a musing smile.\r\n\r\nBut he remained resolutely skeptical. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, give them a year or two more\r\nand they\xe2\x80\x99ll collapse--! His pictures will never sell, you know. He\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nnever even get them into a show.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose not. And she\xe2\x80\x99ll never have time to do anything worth while\r\nwith her music.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had reached a piny knoll high above the ledge on which the house\r\nwas perched. All about them stretched an empty landscape of endless\r\nfeatureless wooded hills. \xe2\x80\x9cThink of sticking here all the year round!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Lansing groaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know. But then think of wandering over the world with some people!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Lord, yes. For instance, my trip to India with the Mortimer\r\nHickses. But it was my only chance and what the deuce is one to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I knew!\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed, thinking of the Bockheimers; and he turned\r\nand looked at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnew what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe answer to your question. What is one to do--when one sees both\r\nsides of the problem? Or every possible side of it, indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had seated themselves on a commanding rock under the pines, but\r\nLansing could not see the view at their feet for the stir of the brown\r\nlashes on her cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean: Nat and Grace may after all be having the best of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I say, when I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you I see all the sides? Of course,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Susy added hastily, \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t live as they do for a week. But it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwonderful how little it\xe2\x80\x99s dimmed them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly Nat was never more coruscating. And she keeps it up even\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d He reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cWe do them good, I daresay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--or they us. I wonder which?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter that, he seemed to remember that they sat a long time silent, and\r\nthat his next utterance was a boyish outburst against the tyranny of the\r\nexisting order of things, abruptly followed by the passionate query why,\r\nsince he and she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t alter it, and since they both had the habit of\r\nlooking at facts as they were, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be utter fools not to take\r\ntheir chance of being happy in the only way that was open to them, To\r\nthis challenge he did not recall Susy\xe2\x80\x99s making any definite answer; but\r\nafter another interval, in which all the world seemed framed in a\r\nsudden kiss, he heard her murmur to herself in a brooding tone: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsuppose it\xe2\x80\x99s ever been tried before; but we might--.\xe2\x80\x9d And then and there\r\nshe had laid before him the very experiment they had since hazarded.\r\n\r\nShe would have none of surreptitious bliss, she began by declaring;\r\nand she set forth her reasons with her usual lucid impartiality. In the\r\nfirst place, she should have to marry some day, and when she made the\r\nbargain she meant it to be an honest one; and secondly, in the matter\r\nof love, she would never give herself to anyone she did not really care\r\nfor, and if such happiness ever came to her she did not want it shorn of\r\nhalf its brightness by the need of fibbing and plotting and dodging.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen too much of that kind of thing. Half the women I know who\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nhad lovers have had them for the fun of sneaking and lying about it; but\r\nthe other half have been miserable. And I should be miserable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was at this point that she unfolded her plan. Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they\r\nmarry; belong to each other openly and honourably, if for ever so short\r\na time, and with the definite understanding that whenever either of them\r\ngot the chance to do better he or she should be immediately released?\r\nThe law of their country facilitated such exchanges, and society was\r\nbeginning to view them as indulgently as the law. As Susy talked, she\r\nwarmed to her theme and began to develop its endless possibilities.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe should really, in a way, help more than we should hamper each\r\nother,\xe2\x80\x9d she ardently explained. \xe2\x80\x9cWe both know the ropes so well; what\r\none of us didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the other might--in the way of opportunities, I\r\nmean. And then we should be a novelty as married people. We\xe2\x80\x99re both\r\nrather unusually popular--why not be frank!--and it\xe2\x80\x99s such a blessing\r\nfor dinner-givers to be able to count on a couple of whom neither one is\r\na blank. Yes, I really believe we should be more than twice the success\r\nwe are now; at least,\xe2\x80\x9d she added with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cif there\xe2\x80\x99s that amount\r\nof room for improvement. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you feel; a man\xe2\x80\x99s popularity\r\nis so much less precarious than a girl\xe2\x80\x99s--but I know it would furbish me\r\nup tremendously to reappear as a married woman.\xe2\x80\x9d She glanced away from\r\nhim down the long valley at their feet, and added in a lower tone: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nI should like, just for a little while, to feel I had something in life\r\nof my very own--something that nobody had lent me, like a fancy-dress or\r\na motor or an opera cloak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe suggestion, at first, had seemed to Lansing as mad as it was\r\nenchanting: it had thoroughly frightened him. But Susy\xe2\x80\x99s arguments were\r\nirrefutable, her ingenuities inexhaustible. Had he ever thought it all\r\nout? She asked. No. Well, she had; and would he kindly not interrupt? In\r\nthe first place, there would be all the wedding-presents. Jewels, and a\r\nmotor, and a silver dinner service, did she mean? Not a bit of it! She\r\ncould see he\xe2\x80\x99d never given the question proper thought. Cheques, my\r\ndear, nothing but cheques--she undertook to manage that on her side: she\r\nreally thought she could count on about fifty, and she supposed he could\r\nrake up a few more? Well, all that would simply represent pocket-money!\r\nFor they would have plenty of houses to live in: he\xe2\x80\x99d see. People were\r\nalways glad to lend their house to a newly-married couple. It was such\r\nfun to pop down and see them: it made one feel romantic and jolly. All\r\nthey need do was to accept the houses in turn: go on honey-mooning for\r\na year! What was he afraid of? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t he think they\xe2\x80\x99d be happy enough to\r\nwant to keep it up? And why not at least try--get engaged, and then\r\nsee what would happen? Even if she was all wrong, and her plan failed,\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it have been rather nice, just for a month or two, to fancy\r\nthey were going to be happy? \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve often fancied it all by myself,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she concluded; \xe2\x80\x9cbut fancying it with you would somehow be so awfully\r\ndifferent....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was how it began: and this lakeside dream was what it had led up\r\nto. Fantastically improbable as they had seemed, all her previsions had\r\ncome true. If there were certain links in the chain that Lansing\r\nhad never been able to put his hand on, certain arrangements and\r\ncontrivances that still needed further elucidation, why, he was lazily\r\nresolved to clear them up with her some day; and meanwhile it was worth\r\nall the past might have cost, and every penalty the future might exact\r\nof him, just to be sitting here in the silence and sweetness, her\r\nsleeping head on his knee, clasped in his joy as the hushed world was\r\nclasped in moonlight.\r\n\r\nHe stooped down and kissed her. \xe2\x80\x9cWake up,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbed-time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEIR month of Como was within a few hours of ending. Till the last\r\nmoment they had hoped for a reprieve; but the accommodating Streffy had\r\nbeen unable to put the villa at their disposal for a longer time, since\r\nhe had had the luck to let it for a thumping price to some beastly\r\nbouncers who insisted on taking possession at the date agreed on.\r\n\r\nLansing, leaving Susy\xe2\x80\x99s side at dawn, had gone down to the lake for a\r\nlast plunge; and swimming homeward through the crystal light he looked\r\nup at the garden brimming with flowers, the long low house with the\r\ncypress wood above it, and the window behind which his wife still\r\nslept. The month had been exquisite, and their happiness as rare, as\r\nfantastically complete, as the scene before him. He sank his chin into\r\nthe sunlit ripples and sighed for sheer content....\r\n\r\nIt was a bore to be leaving the scene of such complete well-being, but\r\nthe next stage in their progress promised to be hardly less delightful.\r\nSusy was a magician: everything she predicted came true. Houses were\r\nbeing showered on them; on all sides he seemed to see beneficent spirits\r\nwinging toward them, laden with everything from a piano nobile in Venice\r\nto a camp in the Adirondacks. For the present, they had decided on the\r\nformer. Other considerations apart, they dared not risk the expense of a\r\njourney across the Atlantic; so they were heading instead for the Nelson\r\nVanderlyns\xe2\x80\x99 palace on the Giudecca. They were agreed that, for reasons\r\nof expediency, it might be wise to return to New York for the coming\r\nwinter. It would keep them in view, and probably lead to fresh\r\nopportunities; indeed, Susy already had in mind the convenient flat that\r\nshe was sure a migratory cousin (if tactfully handled, and assured that\r\nthey would not overwork her cook) could certainly be induced to lend\r\nthem. Meanwhile the need of making plans was still remote; and if there\r\nwas one art in which young Lansing\xe2\x80\x99s twenty-eight years of existence had\r\nperfected him it was that of living completely and unconcernedly in the\r\npresent....\r\n\r\nIf of late he had tried to look into the future more insistently than\r\nwas his habit, it was only because of Susy. He had meant, when they\r\nmarried, to be as philosophic for her as for himself; and he knew she\r\nwould have resented above everything his regarding their partnership as\r\na reason for anxious thought. But since they had been together she had\r\ngiven him glimpses of her past that made him angrily long to shelter\r\nand defend her future. It was intolerable that a spirit as fine as hers\r\nshould be ever so little dulled or diminished by the kind of compromises\r\nout of which their wretched lives were made. For himself, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\na hang: he had composed for his own guidance a rough-and-ready code,\r\na short set of \xe2\x80\x9cmays\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmustn\xe2\x80\x99ts\xe2\x80\x9d which immensely simplified his\r\ncourse. There were things a fellow put up with for the sake of certain\r\ndefinite and otherwise unattainable advantages; there were other things\r\nhe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t traffic with at any price. But for a woman, he began to\r\nsee, it might be different. The temptations might be greater, the cost\r\nconsiderably higher, the dividing line between the \xe2\x80\x9cmays\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmustn\xe2\x80\x99ts\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n more fluctuating and less sharply drawn. Susy, thrown on the world\r\nat seventeen, with only a weak wastrel of a father to define that\r\ntreacherous line for her, and with every circumstance soliciting her to\r\noverstep it, seemed to have been preserved chiefly by an innate scorn\r\nof most of the objects of human folly. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch trash as he went to pieces\r\nfor,\xe2\x80\x9d was her curt comment on her parent\xe2\x80\x99s premature demise: as\r\nthough she accepted in advance the necessity of ruining one\xe2\x80\x99s self for\r\nsomething, but was resolved to discriminate firmly between what was\r\nworth it and what wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nThis philosophy had at first enchanted Lansing; but now it began to\r\nrouse vague fears. The fine armour of her fastidiousness had preserved\r\nher from the kind of risks she had hitherto been exposed to; but what if\r\nothers, more subtle, found a joint in it? Was there, among her delicate\r\ndiscriminations, any equivalent to his own rules? Might not her taste\r\nfor the best and rarest be the very instrument of her undoing; and if\r\nsomething that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9ctrash\xe2\x80\x9d came her way, would she hesitate a second\r\nto go to pieces for it?\r\n\r\nHe was determined to stick to the compact that they should do nothing to\r\ninterfere with what each referred to as the other\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cchance\xe2\x80\x9d; but what\r\nif, when hers came, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with her in recognizing it? He\r\nwanted for her, oh, so passionately, the best; but his conception of\r\nthat best had so insensibly, so subtly been transformed in the light of\r\ntheir first month together!\r\n\r\nHis lazy strokes were carrying him slowly shoreward; but the hour was so\r\nexquisite that a few yards from the landing he laid hold of the mooring\r\nrope of Streffy\xe2\x80\x99s boat and floated there, following his dream.... It\r\nwas a bore to be leaving; no doubt that was what made him turn things\r\ninside-out so uselessly. Venice would be delicious, of course; but\r\nnothing would ever again be as sweet as this. And then they had only a\r\nyear of security before them; and of that year a month was gone.\r\n\r\nReluctantly he swam ashore, walked up to the house, and pushed open a\r\nwindow of the cool painted drawing-room. Signs of departure were already\r\nvisible. There were trunks in the hall, tennis rackets on the stairs; on\r\nthe landing, the cook Giulietta had both arms around a slippery hold-all\r\nthat refused to let itself be strapped. It all gave him a chill sense\r\nof unreality, as if the past month had been an act on the stage, and its\r\nsetting were being folded away and rolled into the wings to make room\r\nfor another play in which he and Susy had no part.\r\n\r\nBy the time he came down again, dressed and hungry, to the terrace\r\nwhere coffee awaited him, he had recovered his usual pleasant sense of\r\nsecurity. Susy was there, fresh and gay, a rose in her breast and the\r\nsun in her hair: her head was bowed over Bradshaw, but she waved a fond\r\nhand across the breakfast things, and presently looked up to say: \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\r\nI believe we can just manage it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cManage what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo catch the train at Milan--if we start in the motor at ten sharp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stared. \xe2\x80\x9cThe motor? What motor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the new people\xe2\x80\x99s--Streffy\xe2\x80\x99s tenants. He\xe2\x80\x99s never told me their\r\nname, and the chauffeur says he can\xe2\x80\x99t pronounce it. The chauffeur\xe2\x80\x99s is\r\nOttaviano, anyhow; I\xe2\x80\x99ve been making friends with him. He arrived last\r\nnight, and he says they\xe2\x80\x99re not due at Como till this evening. He simply\r\njumped at the idea of running us over to Milan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord--\xe2\x80\x9d said Lansing, when she stopped.\r\n\r\nShe sprang up from the table with a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be a scramble; but\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll manage it, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll go up at once and pitch the last things into\r\nyour trunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but look here--have you any idea what it\xe2\x80\x99s going to cost?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyebrows gaily. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, a good deal less than our railway\r\ntickets. Ottaviano\xe2\x80\x99s got a sweetheart in Milan, and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t seen her for\r\nsix months. When I found that out I knew he\xe2\x80\x99d be going there anyhow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was clever of her, and he laughed. But why was it that he had grown\r\nto shrink from even such harmless evidence of her always knowing how to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmanage\xe2\x80\x9d? \xe2\x80\x9cOh, well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s right: the fellow would\r\nbe sure to be going to Milan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpstairs, on the way to his dressing room, he found her in a cloud of\r\nfinery which her skilful hands were forcibly compressing into a last\r\nportmanteau. He had never seen anyone pack as cleverly as Susy: the way\r\nshe coaxed reluctant things into a trunk was a symbol of the way she\r\nfitted discordant facts into her life. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I\xe2\x80\x99m rich,\xe2\x80\x9d she often said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe thing I shall hate most will be to see an idiot maid at my trunks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he passed, she glanced over her shoulder, her face pink with the\r\nstruggle, and drew a cigar-box from the depths. \xe2\x80\x9cDearest, do put a\r\ncouple of cigars into your pocket as a tip for Ottaviano.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLansing stared. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what on earth are you doing with Streffy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncigars?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPacking them, of course.... You don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose he meant them for those\r\nother people?\xe2\x80\x9d She gave him a look of honest wonder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whom he meant them for--but they\xe2\x80\x99re not ours....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe continued to look at him wonderingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see what there is to\r\nbe solemn about. The cigars are not Streffy\xe2\x80\x99s either... you may be sure\r\nhe got them out of some bounder. And there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing he\xe2\x80\x99d hate more than\r\nto have them passed on to another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense. If they\xe2\x80\x99re not Streffy\xe2\x80\x99s they\xe2\x80\x99re much less mine. Hand them\r\nover, please, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as you like. But it does seem a waste; and, of course, the other\r\npeople will never have one of them.... The gardener and Giulietta\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlover will see to that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLansing looked away from her at the waves of lace and muslin from which\r\nshe emerged like a rosy Nereid. \xe2\x80\x9cHow many boxes of them are left?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnpack them, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore she moved there was a pause so full of challenge that Lansing had\r\ntime for an exasperated sense of the disproportion between his anger and\r\nits cause. And this made him still angrier.\r\n\r\nShe held out a box. \xe2\x80\x9cThe others are in your suitcase downstairs. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlocked and strapped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me the key, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe might send them back from Venice, mightn\xe2\x80\x99t we? That lock is so\r\nnasty: it will take you half an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me the key, please.\xe2\x80\x9d She gave it.\r\n\r\nHe went downstairs and battled with the lock, for the allotted\r\nhalf-hour, under the puzzled eyes of Giulietta and the sardonic grin of\r\nthe chauffeur, who now and then, from the threshold, politely reminded\r\nhim how long it would take to get to Milan. Finally the key turned, and\r\nLansing, broken-nailed and perspiring, extracted the cigars and stalked\r\nwith them into the deserted drawing room. The great bunches of golden\r\nroses that he and Susy had gathered the day before were dropping their\r\npetals on the marble embroidery of the floor, pale camellias floated in\r\nthe alabaster tazzas between the windows, haunting scents of the garden\r\nblew in on him with the breeze from the lake. Never had Streffy\xe2\x80\x99s little\r\nhouse seemed so like a nest of pleasures. Lansing laid the cigar boxes\r\non a console and ran upstairs to collect his last possessions. When\r\nhe came down again, his wife, her eyes brilliant with achievement, was\r\nseated in their borrowed chariot, the luggage cleverly stowed away, and\r\nGiulietta and the gardener kissing her hand and weeping out inconsolable\r\nfarewells.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what she\xe2\x80\x99s given them?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, as he jumped in beside her\r\nand the motor whirled them through the nightingale-thickets to the gate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLIE STREFFORD\xe2\x80\x99S villa was like a nest in a rose-bush; the Nelson\r\nVanderlyns\xe2\x80\x99 palace called for loftier analogies.\r\n\r\nIts vastness and splendour seemed, in comparison, oppressive to Susy.\r\nTheir landing, after dark, at the foot of the great shadowy staircase,\r\ntheir dinner at a dimly-lit table under a ceiling weighed down with\r\nOlympians, their chilly evening in a corner of a drawing room where\r\nminuets should have been danced before a throne, contrasted with the\r\nhappy intimacies of Como as their sudden sense of disaccord contrasted\r\nwith the mutual confidence of the day before.\r\n\r\nThe journey had been particularly jolly: both Susy and Lansing had had\r\ntoo long a discipline in the art of smoothing things over not to make\r\na special effort to hide from each other the ravages of their first\r\ndisagreement. But, deep down and invisible, the disagreement remained;\r\nand compunction for having been its cause gnawed at Susy\xe2\x80\x99s bosom as she\r\nsat in her tapestried and vaulted bedroom, brushing her hair before a\r\ntarnished mirror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I liked grandeur; but this place is really out of scale,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nmused, watching the reflection of a pale hand move back and forward\r\nin the dim recesses of the mirror. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cEllie\r\nVanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s hardly half an inch taller than I am; and she certainly\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t a bit more dignified.... I wonder if it\xe2\x80\x99s because I feel so\r\nhorribly small to-night that the place seems so horribly big.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe loved luxury: splendid things always made her feel handsome and\r\nhigh ceilings arrogant; she did not remember having ever before been\r\noppressed by the evidences of wealth.\r\n\r\nShe laid down the brush and leaned her chin on her clasped hands....\r\nEven now she could not understand what had made her take the cigars.\r\nShe had always been alive to the value of her inherited scruples: her\r\nreasoned opinions were unusually free, but with regard to the things\r\none couldn\xe2\x80\x99t reason about she was oddly tenacious. And yet she had taken\r\nStreffy\xe2\x80\x99s cigars! She had taken them--yes, that was the point--she\r\nhad taken them for Nick, because the desire to please him, to make\r\nthe smallest details of his life easy and agreeable and luxurious,\r\nhad become her absorbing preoccupation. She had committed, for him,\r\nprecisely the kind of little baseness she would most have scorned to\r\ncommit for herself; and, since he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t instantly felt the difference,\r\nshe would never be able to explain it to him.\r\n\r\nShe stood up with a sigh, shook out her loosened hair, and glanced\r\naround the great frescoed room. The maid-servant had said something\r\nabout the Signora\xe2\x80\x99s having left a letter for her; and there it lay on\r\nthe writing-table, with her mail and Nick\xe2\x80\x99s; a thick envelope addressed\r\nin Ellie\xe2\x80\x99s childish scrawl, with a glaring \xe2\x80\x9cPrivate\xe2\x80\x9d dashed across the\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth can she have to say, when she hates writing so,\xe2\x80\x9d Susy\r\nmused.\r\n\r\nShe broke open the envelope, and four or five stamped and sealed letters\r\nfell from it. All were addressed, in Ellie\xe2\x80\x99s hand, to Nelson Vanderlyn\r\nEsqre; and in the corner of each was faintly pencilled a number and a\r\ndate: one, two, three, four--with a week\xe2\x80\x99s interval between the dates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness--\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Susy, understanding.\r\n\r\nShe had dropped into an armchair near the table, and for a long time\r\nshe sat staring at the numbered letters. A sheet of paper covered with\r\nEllie\xe2\x80\x99s writing had fluttered out among them, but she let it lie;\r\nshe knew so well what it would say! She knew all about her friend, of\r\ncourse; except poor old Nelson, who didn\xe2\x80\x99t, But she had never imagined\r\nthat Ellie would dare to use her in this way. It was unbelievable... she\r\nhad never pictured anything so vile.... The blood rushed to her face,\r\nand she sprang up angrily, half minded to tear the letters in bits and\r\nthrow them all into the fire.\r\n\r\nShe heard her husband\xe2\x80\x99s knock on the door between their rooms, and swept\r\nthe dangerous packet under the blotting-book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, go away, please, there\xe2\x80\x99s a dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she called out; \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfinished unpacking, and everything\xe2\x80\x99s in such a mess.\xe2\x80\x9d Gathering up\r\nNick\xe2\x80\x99s papers and letters, she ran across the room and thrust them\r\nthrough the door. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s something to keep you quiet,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed,\r\nshining in on him an instant from the threshold.\r\n\r\nShe turned back feeling weak with shame. Ellie\xe2\x80\x99s letter lay on the\r\nfloor: reluctantly she stooped to pick it up, and one by one the\r\nexpected phrases sprang out at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne good turn deserves another.... Of course you and Nick are welcome\r\nto stay all summer.... There won\xe2\x80\x99t be a particle of expense for you--the\r\nservants have orders.... If you\xe2\x80\x99ll just be an angel and post these\r\nletters yourself.... It\xe2\x80\x99s been my only chance for such an age; when we\r\nmeet I\xe2\x80\x99ll explain everything. And in a month at latest I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back to\r\nfetch Clarissa....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy lifted the letter to the lamp to be sure she had read aright. To\r\nfetch Clarissa! Then Ellie\xe2\x80\x99s child was here? Here, under the roof with\r\nthem, left to their care? She read on, raging. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s so delighted, poor\r\ndarling, to know you\xe2\x80\x99re coming. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to sack her beastly governess\r\nfor impertinence, and if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for you she\xe2\x80\x99d be all alone with a\r\nlot of servants I don\xe2\x80\x99t much trust. So for pity\xe2\x80\x99s sake be good to my\r\nchild, and forgive me for leaving her. She thinks I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone to take a\r\ncure; and she knows she\xe2\x80\x99s not to tell her Daddy that I\xe2\x80\x99m away, because\r\nit would only worry him if he thought I was ill. She\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly to be\r\ntrusted; you\xe2\x80\x99ll see what a clever angel she is....\xe2\x80\x9d And then, at the\r\nbottom of the page, in a last slanting postscript: \xe2\x80\x9cSusy darling, if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve ever owed me anything in the way of kindness, you won\xe2\x80\x99t, on your\r\nsacred honour, say a word of this to any one, even to Nick. And I know I\r\ncan count on you to rub out the numbers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy sprang up and tossed Mrs. Vanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s letter into the fire: then\r\nshe came slowly back to the chair. There, at her elbow, lay the four\r\nfatal envelopes; and her next affair was to make up her mind what to do\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nTo destroy them on the spot had seemed, at first thought, inevitable: it\r\nmight be saving Ellie as well as herself. But such a step seemed to Susy\r\nto involve departure on the morrow, and this in turn involved notifying\r\nEllie, whose letter she had vainly scanned for an address. Well--perhaps\r\nClarissa\xe2\x80\x99s nurse would know where one could write to her mother; it was\r\nunlikely that even Ellie would go off without assuring some means of\r\ncommunication with her child. At any rate, there was nothing to be done\r\nthat night: nothing but to work out the details of their flight on the\r\nmorrow, and rack her brains to find a substitute for the hospitality\r\nthey were rejecting. Susy did not disguise from herself how much she had\r\ncounted on the Vanderlyn apartment for the summer: to be able to do\r\nso had singularly simplified the future. She knew Ellie\xe2\x80\x99s largeness of\r\nhand, and had been sure in advance that as long as they were her guests\r\ntheir only expense would be an occasional present to the servants. And\r\nwhat would the alternative be? She and Lansing, in their endless talks,\r\nhad so lived themselves into the vision of indolent summer days on the\r\nlagoon, of flaming hours on the beach of the Lido, and evenings of music\r\nand dreams on their broad balcony above the Giudecca, that the idea of\r\nhaving to renounce these joys, and deprive her Nick of them, filled Susy\r\nwith a wrath intensified by his having confided in her that when they\r\nwere quietly settled in Venice he \xe2\x80\x9cmeant to write.\xe2\x80\x9d Already nascent in\r\nher breast was the fierce resolve of the author\xe2\x80\x99s wife to defend her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s privacy and facilitate his encounters with the Muse. It was\r\nabominable, simply abominable, that Ellie Vanderlyn should have drawn\r\nher into such a trap!\r\n\r\nWell--there was nothing for it but to make a clean breast of the whole\r\nthing to Nick. The trivial incident of the cigars--how trivial it now\r\nseemed!--showed her the kind of stand he would take, and communicated to\r\nher something of his own uncompromising energy. She would tell him the\r\nwhole story in the morning, and try to find a way out with him: Susy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfaith in her power of finding a way out was inexhaustible. But suddenly\r\nshe remembered the adjuration at the end of Mrs. Vanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s letter: \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re ever owed me anything in the way of kindness, you won\xe2\x80\x99t, on your\r\nsacred honour, say a word to Nick....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, exactly what no one had the right to ask of her: if\r\nindeed the word \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d, could be used in any conceivable relation to\r\nthis coil of wrongs. But the fact remained that, in the way of kindness,\r\nshe did owe much to Ellie; and that this was the first payment her\r\nfriend had ever exacted. She found herself, in fact, in exactly the same\r\nposition as when Ursula Gillow, using the same argument, had appealed\r\nto her to give up Nick Lansing. Yes, Susy reflected; but then Nelson\r\nVanderlyn had been kind to her too; and the money Ellie had been so kind\r\nwith was Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s.... The queer edifice of Susy\xe2\x80\x99s standards tottered on\r\nits base she honestly didn\xe2\x80\x99t know where fairness lay, as between so much\r\nthat was foul.\r\n\r\nThe very depth of her perplexity puzzled her. She had been in \xe2\x80\x9ctight\r\nplaces\xe2\x80\x9d before; had indeed been in so few that were not, in one way or\r\nanother, constricting! As she looked back on her past it lay before her\r\nas a very network of perpetual concessions and contrivings. But\r\nnever before had she had such a sense of being tripped up, gagged and\r\npinioned. The little misery of the cigars still galled her, and now\r\nthis big humiliation superposed itself on the raw wound. Decidedly, the\r\nsecond month of their honey-moon was beginning cloudily....\r\n\r\nShe glanced at the enamel led travelling-clock on her dressing\r\ntable--one of the few wedding-presents she had consented to accept in\r\nkind--and was startled at the lateness of the hour. In a moment Nick\r\nwould be coming; and an uncomfortable sensation in her throat warned\r\nher that through sheer nervousness and exasperation she might blurt out\r\nsomething ill-advised. The old habit of being always on her guard made\r\nher turn once more to the looking-glass. Her face was pale and haggard;\r\nand having, by a swift and skilful application of cosmetics, increased\r\nits appearance of fatigue, she crossed the room and softly opened her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\nHe too sat by a lamp, reading a letter which he put aside as she\r\nentered. His face was grave, and she said to herself that he was\r\ncertainly still thinking about the cigars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very tired, dearest, and my head aches so horribly that I\xe2\x80\x99ve come\r\nto bid you good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d Bending over the back of his chair, she laid\r\nher arms on his shoulders. He lifted his hands to clasp hers, but, as\r\nhe threw his head back to smile up at her she noticed that his look was\r\nstill serious, almost remote. It was as if, for the first time, a faint\r\nveil hung between his eyes and hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry: it\xe2\x80\x99s been a long day for you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said absently, pressing\r\nhis lips to her hands\r\n\r\nShe felt the dreaded twitch in her throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNick!\xe2\x80\x9d she burst out, tightening her embrace, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore I go, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nto swear to me on your honour that you know I should never have taken\r\nthose cigars for myself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment he stared at her, and she stared back at him with equal\r\ngravity; then the same irresistible mirth welled up in both, and Susy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompunctions were swept away on a gale of laughter.\r\n\r\nWhen she woke the next morning the sun was pouring in between her\r\ncurtains of old brocade, and its refraction from the ripples of the\r\nCanal was drawing a network of golden scales across the vaulted ceiling.\r\nThe maid had just placed a tray on a slim marquetry table near the bed,\r\nand over the edge of the tray Susy discovered the small serious face\r\nof Clarissa Vanderlyn. At the sight of the little girl all her dormant\r\nqualms awoke.\r\n\r\nClarissa was just eight, and small for her age: her little round chin\r\nwas barely on a level with the tea-service, and her clear brown eyes\r\ngazed at Susy between the ribs of the toast-rack and the single tea-rose\r\nin an old Murano glass. Susy had not seen her for two years, and she\r\nseemed, in the interval, to have passed from a thoughtful infancy to\r\ncomplete ripeness of feminine experience. She was looking with approval\r\nat her mother\xe2\x80\x99s guest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you\xe2\x80\x99ve come,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a small sweet voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI like you\r\nso very much. I know I\xe2\x80\x99m not to be often with you; but at least you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave an eye on me, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn eye on you! I shall never want to have it off you, if you say such\r\nnice things to me!\xe2\x80\x9d Susy laughed, leaning from her pillows to draw the\r\nlittle girl up to her side.\r\n\r\nClarissa smiled and settled herself down comfortably on the silken\r\nbedspread. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know I\xe2\x80\x99m not to be always about, because you\xe2\x80\x99re just\r\nmarried; but could you see to it that I have my meals regularly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you poor darling! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you always?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot when mother\xe2\x80\x99s away on these cures. The servants don\xe2\x80\x99t always obey\r\nme: you see I\xe2\x80\x99m so little for my age. In a few years, of course, they\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave to--even if I don\xe2\x80\x99t grow much,\xe2\x80\x9d she added judiciously. She put out\r\nher hand and touched the string of pearls about Susy\xe2\x80\x99s throat. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nsmall, but they\xe2\x80\x99re very good. I suppose you don\xe2\x80\x99t take the others when\r\nyou travel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe others? Bless you! I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any others--and never shall have,\r\nprobably.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo other pearls?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo other jewels at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarissa stared. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that really true?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, as if in the presence\r\nof the unprecedented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAwfully true,\xe2\x80\x9d Susy confessed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I think I can make the servants\r\nobey me all the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis point seemed to have lost its interest for Clarissa, who was still\r\ngravely scrutinizing her companion. After a while she brought forth\r\nanother question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you have to give up all your jewels when you were divorced?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDivorced--?\xe2\x80\x9d Susy threw her head back against the pillows and laughed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what are you thinking of? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even\r\nmarried the last time you saw me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I do. But that was two years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d The little girl wound her arms\r\nabout Susy\xe2\x80\x99s neck and leaned against her caressingly. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to\r\nbe soon, then? I\xe2\x80\x99ll promise not to tell if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want me to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing to be divorced? Of course not! What in the world made you think\r\nso? \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you look so awfully happy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarissa Vanderlyn simply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was a trifling enough sign, but it had remained in Susy\xe2\x80\x99s mind: that\r\nfirst morning in Venice Nick had gone out without first coming in to see\r\nher. She had stayed in bed late, chatting with Clarissa, and expecting\r\nto see the door open and her husband appear; and when the child left,\r\nand she had jumped up and looked into Nick\xe2\x80\x99s room, she found it empty,\r\nand a line on his dressing table informed her that he had gone out to\r\nsend a telegram.\r\n\r\nIt was lover-like, and even boyish, of him to think it necessary to\r\nexplain his absence; but why had he not simply come in and told her! She\r\ninstinctively connected the little fact with the shade of preoccupation\r\nshe had noticed on his face the night before, when she had gone to his\r\nroom and found him absorbed in letter; and while she dressed she had\r\ncontinued to wonder what was in the letter, and whether the telegram he\r\nhad hurried out to send was an answer to it.\r\n\r\nShe had never found out. When he reappeared, handsome and happy as the\r\nmorning, he proffered no explanation; and it was part of her life-long\r\npolicy not to put uncalled-for questions. It was not only that her\r\njealous regard for her own freedom was matched by an equal respect for\r\nthat of others; she had steered too long among the social reefs and\r\nshoals not to know how narrow is the passage that leads to peace of\r\nmind, and she was determined to keep her little craft in mid-channel.\r\nBut the incident had lodged itself in her memory, acquiring a sort of\r\nsymbolic significance, as of a turning-point in her relations with her\r\nhusband. Not that these were less happy, but that she now beheld them,\r\nas she had always formerly beheld such joys, as an unstable islet in\r\na sea of storms. Her present bliss was as complete as ever, but it was\r\nringed by the perpetual menace of all she knew she was hiding from Nick,\r\nand of all she suspected him of hiding from her....\r\n\r\nShe was thinking of these things one afternoon about three weeks after\r\ntheir arrival in Venice. It was near sunset, and she sat alone on the\r\nbalcony, watching the cross-lights on the water weave their pattern\r\nabove the flushed reflection of old palace-basements. She was\r\nalmost always alone at that hour. Nick had taken to writing in the\r\nafternoons--he had been as good as his word, and so, apparently, had the\r\nMuse and it was his habit to join his wife only at sunset, for a late\r\nrow on the lagoon. She had taken Clarissa, as usual, to the Giardino\r\nPubblico, where that obliging child had politely but indifferently\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cplayed\xe2\x80\x9d--Clarissa joined in the diversions of her age as if conforming\r\nto an obsolete tradition--and had brought her back for a music lesson,\r\nechoes of which now drifted down from a distant window.\r\n\r\nSusy had come to be extremely thankful for Clarissa. But for the little\r\ngirl, her pride in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s industry might have been tinged with\r\na faint sense of being at times left out and forgotten; and as Nick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nindustry was the completest justification for their being where they\r\nwere, and for her having done what she had, she was grateful to Clarissa\r\nfor helping her to feel less alone. Clarissa, indeed, represented the\r\nother half of her justification: it was as much on the child\xe2\x80\x99s account\r\nas on Nick\xe2\x80\x99s that Susy had held her tongue, remained in Venice, and\r\nslipped out once a week to post one of Ellie\xe2\x80\x99s numbered letters. A\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s experience of the Palazzo Vanderlyn had convinced Susy of the\r\nimpossibility of deserting Clarissa. Long experience had shown her that\r\nthe most crowded households often contain the loneliest nurseries,\r\nand that the rich child is exposed to evils unknown to less pampered\r\ninfancy; but hitherto such things had merely been to her one of the\r\nuglier bits in the big muddled pattern of life. Now she found herself\r\nfeeling where before she had only judged: her precarious bliss came to\r\nher charged with a new weight of pity.\r\n\r\nShe was thinking of these things, and of the approaching date of Ellie\r\nVanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s return, and of the searching truths she was storing up for\r\nthat lady\xe2\x80\x99s private ear, when she noticed a gondola turning its\r\nprow toward the steps below the balcony. She leaned over, and a tall\r\ngentleman in shabby clothes, glancing up at her as he jumped out, waved\r\na mouldy Panama in joyful greeting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStreffy!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed as joyfully; and she was half-way down the\r\nstairs when he ran up them followed by his luggage-laden boatman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right, I suppose?--Ellie said I might come,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained in\r\na shrill cheerful voice; \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m to have my same green room with the\r\nparrot-panels, because its furniture is already so frightfully stained\r\nwith my hair-wash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy was beaming on him with the deep sense of satisfaction which his\r\npresence always produced in his friends. There was no one in the world,\r\nthey all agreed, half as ugly and untidy and delightful as Streffy; no\r\none who combined such outspoken selfishness with such imperturbable good\r\nhumour; no one who knew so well how to make you believe he was being\r\ncharming to you when it was you who were being charming to him.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these seductions, of which none estimated the value\r\nmore accurately than their possessor, Strefford had for Susy another\r\nattraction of which he was probably unconscious. It was that of being\r\nthe one rooted and stable being among the fluid and shifting figures\r\nthat composed her world. Susy had always lived among people so\r\ndenationalized that those one took for Russians generally turned out to\r\nbe American, and those one was inclined to ascribe to New York proved to\r\nhave originated in Rome or Bucharest. These cosmopolitan people, who, in\r\ncountries not their own, lived in houses as big as hotels, or in\r\nhotels where the guests were as international as the waiters, had\r\ninter-married, inter-loved and inter-divorced each other over the whole\r\nface of Europe, and according to every code that attempts to regulate\r\nhuman ties. Strefford, too, had his home in this world, but only one\r\nof his homes. The other, the one he spoke of, and probably thought\r\nof, least often, was a great dull English country-house in a northern\r\ncounty, where a life as monotonous and self-contained as his own was\r\nchequered and dispersed had gone on for generation after generation;\r\nand it was the sense of that house, and of all it typified even to his\r\nvagrancy and irreverence, which, coming out now and then in his talk, or\r\nin his attitude toward something or somebody, gave him a firmer\r\noutline and a steadier footing than the other marionettes in the dance.\r\nSuperficially so like them all, and so eager to outdo them in detachment\r\nand adaptability, ridiculing the prejudices he had shaken off, and the\r\npeople to whom he belonged, he still kept, under his easy pliancy, the\r\nskeleton of old faiths and old fashions. \xe2\x80\x9cHe talks every language as\r\nwell as the rest of us,\xe2\x80\x9d Susy had once said of him, \xe2\x80\x9cbut at least he\r\ntalks one language better than the others\xe2\x80\x9d; and Strefford, told of the\r\nremark, had laughed, called her an idiot, and been pleased.\r\n\r\nAs he shambled up the stairs with her, arm in arm, she was thinking of\r\nthis quality with a new appreciation of its value. Even she and Lansing,\r\nin spite of their unmixed Americanism, their substantial background of\r\nold-fashioned cousinships in New York and Philadelphia, were as\r\nmentally detached, as universally at home, as touts at an International\r\nExhibition. If they were usually recognized as Americans it was only\r\nbecause they spoke French so well, and because Nick was too fair to be\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cforeign,\xe2\x80\x9d and too sharp-featured to be English. But Charlie Strefford\r\nwas English with all the strength of an inveterate habit; and something\r\nin Susy was slowly waking to a sense of the beauty of habit.\r\n\r\nLounging on the balcony, whither he had followed her without pausing\r\nto remove the stains of travel, Strefford showed himself immensely\r\ninterested in the last chapter of her history, greatly pleased at its\r\nhaving been enacted under his roof, and hugely and flippantly amused\r\nat the firmness with which she refused to let him see Nick till the\r\nlatter\xe2\x80\x99s daily task was over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWriting? Rot! What\xe2\x80\x99s he writing? He\xe2\x80\x99s breaking you in, my dear; that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat he\xe2\x80\x99s doing: establishing an alibi. What\xe2\x80\x99ll you bet he\xe2\x80\x99s just\r\nsitting there smoking and reading Le Rire? Let\xe2\x80\x99s go and see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Susy was firm. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s read me his first chapter: it\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na philosophic romance--rather like Marius, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes--I do!\xe2\x80\x9d said Strefford, with a laugh that she thought idiotic.\r\n\r\nShe flushed up like a child. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re stupid, Streffy. You forget that\r\nNick and I don\xe2\x80\x99t need alibis. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got rid of all that hyprocrisy by\r\nagreeing that each will give the other a hand up when either of us wants\r\na change. We\xe2\x80\x99ve not married to spy and lie, and nag each other; we\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nformed a partnership for our mutual advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see; that\xe2\x80\x99s capital. But how can you be sure that, when Nick wants a\r\nchange, you\xe2\x80\x99ll consider it for his advantage to have one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the point that had always secretly tormented Susy; she often\r\nwondered if it equally tormented Nick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I shall have enough common sense--\xe2\x80\x9d she began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, of course: common sense is what you\xe2\x80\x99re both bound to base your\r\nargument on, whichever way you argue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis flash of insight disconcerted her, and she said, a little\r\nirritably: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat should you do then, if you married?--Hush, Streffy! I\r\nforbid you to shout like that--all the gondolas are stopping to look!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I help it?\xe2\x80\x9d He rocked backward and forward in his chair. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98If\r\nyou marry,\xe2\x80\x99 she says: \xe2\x80\x98Streffy, what have you decided to do if you\r\nsuddenly become a raving maniac?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said no such thing. If your uncle and your cousin died, you\xe2\x80\x99d marry\r\nto-morrow; you know you would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, now you\xe2\x80\x99re talking business.\xe2\x80\x9d He folded his long arms and leaned\r\nover the balcony, looking down at the dusky ripples streaked with fire.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case I should say: \xe2\x80\x98Susan, my dear--Susan--now that by\r\nthe merciful intervention of Providence you have become Countess of\r\nAltringham in the peerage of Great Britain, and Baroness Dunsterville\r\nand d\xe2\x80\x99Amblay in the peerages of Ireland and Scotland, I\xe2\x80\x99ll thank you to\r\nremember that you are a member of one of the most ancient houses in the\r\nUnited Kingdom--and not to get found out.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know what those warnings mean! I pity my namesake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe swung about and gave her a quick look out of his small ugly twinkling\r\neyes. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there any other woman in the world named Susan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so, if the name\xe2\x80\x99s an essential. Even if Nick chucks me, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncount on me to carry out that programme. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it in practice too\r\noften.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well: as far as I know, everybody\xe2\x80\x99s in perfect health at\r\nAltringham.\xe2\x80\x9d He fumbled in his pocket and drew out a fountain pen,\r\na handkerchief over which it had leaked, and a packet of dishevelled\r\ncigarettes. Lighting one, and restoring the other objects to his pocket,\r\nhe continued calmly: \xe2\x80\x9cTell me how did you manage to smooth things over\r\nwith the Gillows? Ursula was running amuck when I was in Newport last\r\nSummer; it was just when people were beginning to say that you were\r\ngoing to marry Nick. I was afraid she\xe2\x80\x99d put a spoke in your wheel; and I\r\nhear she put a big cheque in your hand instead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy was silent. From the first moment of Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s appearance she had\r\nknown that in the course of time he would put that question. He was as\r\ninquisitive as a monkey, and when he had made up his mind to find out\r\nanything it was useless to try to divert his attention. After a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhesitation she said: \xe2\x80\x9cI flirted with Fred. It was a bore but he was very\r\ndecent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would be--poor Fred. And you got Ursula thoroughly frightened!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--enough. And then luckily that young Nerone Altineri turned up\r\nfrom Rome: he went over to New York to look for a job as an engineer,\r\nand Ursula made Fred put him in their iron works.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused again,\r\nand then added abruptly: \xe2\x80\x9cStreffy! If you knew how I hate that kind of\r\nthing. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have Nick come in now and tell me frankly, as I know\r\nhe would, that he\xe2\x80\x99s going off with--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith Coral Hicks?\xe2\x80\x9d Strefford suggested.\r\n\r\nShe laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Coral Hicks! What on earth made you think of the\r\nHickses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I caught a glimpse of them the other day at Capri. They\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ncruising about: they said they were coming in here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a nuisance! I do hope they won\xe2\x80\x99t find us out. They were\r\nawfully kind to Nick when he went to India with them, and they\xe2\x80\x99re so\r\nsimple-minded that they would expect him to be glad to see them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrefford aimed his cigarette-end at a tourist on a puggaree who was\r\ngazing up from his guidebook at the palace. \xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured with\r\nsatisfaction, seeing the shot take effect; then he added: \xe2\x80\x9cCoral Hicks\r\nis growing up rather pretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Streff--you\xe2\x80\x99re dreaming! That lump of a girl with spectacles and\r\nthick ankles! Poor Mrs. Hicks used to say to Nick: \xe2\x80\x98When Mr. Hicks and\r\nI had Coral educated we presumed culture was in greater demand in Europe\r\nthan it appears to be.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see: that girl\xe2\x80\x99s education won\xe2\x80\x99t interfere with her, once\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s started. So then: if Nick came in and told you he was going off--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be so thankful if it was with a fright like Coral! But you\r\nknow,\xe2\x80\x9d she added with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve agreed that it\xe2\x80\x99s not to happen for\r\na year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUSY found Strefford, after his first burst of nonsense, unusually kind\r\nand responsive. The interest he showed in her future and Nick\xe2\x80\x99s seemed\r\nto proceed not so much from his habitual spirit of scientific curiosity\r\nas from simple friendliness. He was privileged to see Nick\xe2\x80\x99s first\r\nchapter, of which he formed so favourable an impression that he spoke\r\nsternly to Susy on the importance of respecting her husband\xe2\x80\x99s working\r\nhours; and he even carried his general benevolence to the length\r\nof showing a fatherly interest in Clarissa Vanderlyn. He was always\r\ncharming to children, but fitfully and warily, with an eye on his\r\nindependence, and on the possibility of being suddenly bored by them;\r\nSusy had never seen him abandon these precautions so completely as he\r\ndid with Clarissa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor little devil! Who looks after her when you and Nick are off\r\ntogether? Do you mean to tell me Ellie sacked the governess and went\r\naway without having anyone to take her place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she expected me to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susy with a touch of asperity.\r\nThere were moments when her duty to Clarissa weighed on her somewhat\r\nheavily; whenever she went off alone with Nick she was pursued by the\r\nvision of a little figure waving wistful farewells from the balcony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that\xe2\x80\x99s like Ellie: you might have known she\xe2\x80\x99d get an equivalent\r\nwhen she lent you all this. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe she thought you\xe2\x80\x99d be so\r\nconscientious about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy considered. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose she did; and perhaps I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nbeen, a year ago. But you see\xe2\x80\x9d--she hesitated--\xe2\x80\x9cNick\xe2\x80\x99s so awfully good:\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s made me look; at a lot of things differently....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hang Nick\xe2\x80\x99s goodness! It\xe2\x80\x99s happiness that\xe2\x80\x99s done it, my dear.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re just one of the people with whom it happens to agree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy, leaning back, scrutinized between her lashes his crooked ironic\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it that\xe2\x80\x99s agreeing with you, Streffy? I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen you so\r\nhuman. You must be getting an outrageous price for the villa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrefford laughed and clapped his hand on his breast-pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cI should\r\nbe an ass not to: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a wire here saying they must have it for\r\nanother month at any price.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat luck! I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad. Who are they, by the way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew himself up out of the long chair in which he was disjointedly\r\nlounging, and looked down at her with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother couple of\r\nlove-sick idiots like you and Nick.... I say, before I spend it all\r\nlet\xe2\x80\x99s go out and buy something ripping for Clarissa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe days passed so quickly and radiantly that, but for her concern\r\nfor Clarissa, Susy would hardly have been conscious of her hostess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprotracted absence. Mrs. Vanderlyn had said: \xe2\x80\x9cFour weeks at the latest,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and the four weeks were over, and she had neither arrived nor written\r\nto explain her non-appearance. She had, in fact, given no sign of life\r\nsince her departure, save in the shape of a post-card which had\r\nreached Clarissa the day after the Lansings\xe2\x80\x99 arrival, and in which Mrs.\r\nVanderlyn instructed her child to be awfully good, and not to forget\r\nto feed the mongoose. Susy noticed that this missive had been posted in\r\nMilan.\r\n\r\nShe communicated her apprehensions to Strefford. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t trust\r\nthat green-eyed nurse. She\xe2\x80\x99s forever with the younger gondolier; and\r\nClarissa\xe2\x80\x99s so awfully sharp. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why Ellie hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come: she was\r\ndue last Monday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer companion laughed, and something in the sound of his laugh suggested\r\nthat he probably knew as much of Ellie\xe2\x80\x99s movements as she did, if not\r\nmore. The sense of disgust which the subject always roused in her made\r\nher look away quickly from his tolerant smile. She would have given\r\nthe world, at that moment, to have been free to tell Nick what she had\r\nlearned on the night of their arrival, and then to have gone away with\r\nhim, no matter where. But there was Clarissa--!\r\n\r\nTo fortify herself against the temptation, she resolutely fixed her\r\nthoughts on her husband. Of Nick\xe2\x80\x99s beatitude there could be no doubt.\r\nHe adored her, he revelled in Venice, he rejoiced in his work; and\r\nconcerning the quality of that work her judgment was as confident as\r\nher heart. She still doubted if he would ever earn a living by what\r\nhe wrote, but she no longer doubted that he would write something\r\nremarkable. The mere fact that he was engaged on a philosophic romance,\r\nand not a mere novel, seemed the proof of an intrinsic superiority. And\r\nif she had mistrusted her impartiality Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s approval would have\r\nreassured her. Among their friends Strefford passed as an authority on\r\nsuch matters: in summing him up his eulogists always added: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\r\nknow he writes.\xe2\x80\x9d As a matter of fact, the paying public had remained\r\ncold to his few published pages; but he lived among the kind of people\r\nwho confuse taste with talent, and are impressed by the most artless\r\nattempts at literary expression; and though he affected to disdain their\r\njudgment, and his own efforts, Susy knew he was not sorry to have it\r\nsaid of him: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, if only Streffy had chosen--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrefford\xe2\x80\x99s approval of the philosophic romance convinced her that it\r\nhad been worth while staying in Venice for Nick\xe2\x80\x99s sake; and if\r\nonly Ellie would come back, and carry off Clarissa to St. Moritz or\r\nDeauville, the disagreeable episode on which their happiness was based\r\nwould vanish like a cloud, and leave them to complete enjoyment.\r\n\r\nEllie did not come; but the Mortimer Hickses did, and Nick Lansing was\r\nassailed by the scruples his wife had foreseen. Strefford, coming back\r\none evening from the Lido, reported having recognized the huge outline\r\nof the Ibis among the pleasure craft of the outer harbour; and the very\r\nnext evening, as the guests of Palazzo Vanderlyn were sipping their ices\r\nat Florian\xe2\x80\x99s, the Hickses loomed up across the Piazza.\r\n\r\nSusy pleaded in vain with her husband in defence of his privacy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember you\xe2\x80\x99re here to write, dearest; it\xe2\x80\x99s your duty not to let any\r\none interfere with that. Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we tell them we\xe2\x80\x99re just leaving!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it\xe2\x80\x99s no use: we\xe2\x80\x99re sure to be always meeting them. And besides,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll be hanged if I\xe2\x80\x99m going to shirk the Hickses. I spent five whole\r\nmonths on the Ibis, and if they bored me occasionally, India didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll make them take us to Aquileia anyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strefford\r\nphilosophically; and the next moment the Hickses were bearing down on\r\nthe defenceless trio.\r\n\r\nThey presented a formidable front, not only because of their mere\r\nphysical bulk--Mr. and Mrs. Hicks were equally and majestically\r\nthree-dimensional--but because they never moved abroad without the\r\nescort of two private secretaries (one for the foreign languages), Mr.\r\nHicks\xe2\x80\x99s doctor, a maiden lady known as Eldoradder Tooker, who was Mrs.\r\nHicks\xe2\x80\x99s cousin and stenographer, and finally their daughter, Coral\r\nHicks.\r\n\r\nCoral Hicks, when Susy had last encountered the party, had been a\r\nfat spectacled school-girl, always lagging behind her parents, with a\r\nreluctant poodle in her wake. Now the poodle had gone, and his mistress\r\nled the procession. The fat school-girl had changed into a young lady\r\nof compact if not graceful outline; a long-handled eyeglass had replaced\r\nthe spectacles, and through it, instead of a sullen glare, Miss Coral\r\nHicks projected on the world a glance at once confident and critical.\r\nShe looked so strong and so assured that Susy, taking her measure in\r\na flash, saw that her position at the head of the procession was not\r\nfortuitous, and murmured inwardly: \xe2\x80\x9cThank goodness she\xe2\x80\x99s not pretty\r\ntoo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf she was not pretty, she was well-dressed; and if she was\r\novereducated, she seemed capable, as Strefford had suggested, of\r\ncarrying off even this crowning disadvantage. At any rate, she was above\r\ndisguising it; and before the whole party had been seated five minutes\r\nin front of a fresh supply of ices (with Eldorada and the secretaries\r\nat a table slightly in the background) she had taken up with Nick the\r\nquestion of exploration in Mesopotamia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQueer child, Coral,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Susy that night as they smoked a last\r\ncigarette on their balcony. \xe2\x80\x9cShe told me this afternoon that she\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nremembered lots of things she heard me say in India. I thought at the\r\ntime that she cared only for caramels and picture-puzzles, but it seems\r\nshe was listening to everything, and reading all the books she could lay\r\nher hands on; and she got so bitten with Oriental archaeology that she\r\ntook a course last year at Bryn Mawr. She means to go to Bagdad next\r\nspring, and back by the Persian plateau and Turkestan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy laughed luxuriously: she was sitting with her hand in Nick\xe2\x80\x99s, while\r\nthe late moon--theirs again--rounded its orange-coloured glory above the\r\nbelfry of San Giorgio.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Coral! How dreary--\xe2\x80\x9d Susy murmured\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDreary? Why? A trip like that is about as well worth doing as anything\r\nI know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I meant: dreary to do it without you or me,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed, getting up\r\nlazily to go indoors. A broad band of moonlight, dividing her room onto\r\ntwo shadowy halves, lay on the painted Venetian bed with its folded-back\r\nsheet, its old damask coverlet and lace-edged pillows. She felt the\r\nwarmth of Nick\xe2\x80\x99s enfolding arm and lifted her face to his.\r\n\r\nThe Hickses retained the most tender memory of Nick\xe2\x80\x99s sojourn on the\r\nIbis, and Susy, moved by their artless pleasure in meeting him again,\r\nwas glad he had not followed her advice and tried to elude them. She had\r\nalways admired Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s ruthless talent for using and discarding the\r\nhuman material in his path, but now she began to hope that Nick would\r\nnot remember her suggestion that he should mete out that measure to the\r\nHickses. Even if it had been less pleasant to have a big yacht at their\r\ndoor during the long golden days and the nights of silver fire, the\r\nHickses\xe2\x80\x99 admiration for Nick would have made Susy suffer them gladly.\r\nShe even began to be aware of a growing liking for them, a liking\r\ninspired by the very characteristics that would once have provoked her\r\ndisapproval. Susy had had plenty of training in liking common people\r\nwith big purses; in such cases her stock of allowances and extenuations\r\nwas inexhaustible. But they had to be successful common people; and the\r\ntrouble was that the Hickses, judged by her standards, were failures.\r\nIt was not only that they were ridiculous; so, heaven knew, were many\r\nof their rivals. But the Hickses were both ridiculous and unsuccessful.\r\nThey had consistently resisted the efforts of the experienced advisers\r\nwho had first descried them on the horizon and tried to help them\r\nupward. They were always taking up the wrong people, giving the wrong\r\nkind of party, and spending millions on things that nobody who mattered\r\ncared about. They all believed passionately in \xe2\x80\x9cmovements\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccauses\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and \xe2\x80\x9cideals,\xe2\x80\x9d and were always attended by the exponents of their latest\r\nbeliefs, always asking you to hear lectures by haggard women in peplums,\r\nand having their portraits painted by wild people who never turned out\r\nto be the fashion.\r\n\r\nAll this would formerly have increased Susy\xe2\x80\x99s contempt; now she found\r\nherself liking the Hickses most for their failings. She was touched by\r\ntheir simple good faith, their isolation in the midst of all their\r\nqueer apostles and parasites, their way of drifting about an alien\r\nand indifferent world in a compactly clinging group of which Eldorada\r\nTooker, the doctor and the two secretaries formed the outer fringe, and\r\nby their view of themselves as a kind of collective re-incarnation of\r\nsome past state of princely culture, symbolised for Mrs. Hicks in what\r\nshe called \xe2\x80\x9cthe court of the Renaissance.\xe2\x80\x9d Eldorada, of course, was\r\ntheir chief prophetess; but even the intensely \xe2\x80\x9cbright\xe2\x80\x9d and modern young\r\nsecretaries, Mr. Beck and Mr. Buttles, showed a touching tendency to\r\nshare her view, and spoke of Mr. Hicks as \xe2\x80\x9cpromoting art,\xe2\x80\x9d in the spirit\r\nof Pandolfino celebrating the munificence of the Medicis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m getting really fond of the Hickses; I believe I should be nice to\r\nthem even if they were staying at Danieli\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d Susy said to Strefford.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd even if you owned the yacht?\xe2\x80\x9d he answered; and for once his banter\r\nstruck her as beside the point.\r\n\r\nThe Ibis carried them, during the endless June days, far and wide along\r\nthe enchanted shores; they roamed among the Euganeans, they saw Aquileia\r\nand Pomposa and Ravenna. Their hosts would gladly have taken them\r\nfarther, across the Adriatic and on into the golden network of the\r\n\xc3\x86gean; but Susy resisted this infraction of Nick\xe2\x80\x99s rules, and he\r\nhimself preferred to stick to his task. Only now he wrote in the early\r\nmornings, so that on most days they could set out before noon and steam\r\nback late to the low fringe of lights on the lagoon. His work continued\r\nto progress, and as page was added to page Susy obscurely but surely\r\nperceived that each one corresponded with a hidden secretion of energy,\r\nthe gradual forming within him of something that might eventually alter\r\nboth their lives. In what sense she could not conjecture: she merely\r\nfelt that the fact of his having chosen a job and stuck to it, if only\r\nthrough a few rosy summer weeks, had already given him a new way of\r\nsaying \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF some new ferment at work in him Nick Lansing himself was equally\r\naware. He was a better judge of the book he was trying to write than\r\neither Susy or Strefford; he knew its weaknesses, its treacheries,\r\nits tendency to slip through his fingers just as he thought his grasp\r\ntightest; but he knew also that at the very moment when it seemed to\r\nhave failed him it would suddenly be back, beating its loud wings in his\r\nface.\r\n\r\nHe had no delusions as to its commercial value, and had winced more than\r\nhe triumphed when Susy produced her allusion to Marius. His book was to\r\nbe called The Pageant of Alexander. His imagination had been enchanted\r\nby the idea of picturing the young conqueror\xe2\x80\x99s advance through the\r\nfabulous landscapes of Asia: he liked writing descriptions, and vaguely\r\nfelt that under the guise of fiction he could develop his theory of\r\nOriental influences in Western art at the expense of less learning than\r\nif he had tried to put his ideas into an essay. He knew enough of his\r\nsubject to know that he did not know enough to write about it; but he\r\nconsoled himself by remembering that Wilhelm Meister has survived many\r\nweighty volumes on aesthetics; and between his moments of self-disgust\r\nhe took himself at Susy\xe2\x80\x99s valuation, and found an unmixed joy in his\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nNever--no, never!--had he been so boundlessly, so confidently happy. His\r\nhack-work had given him the habit of application, and now habit wore the\r\nglow of inspiration. His previous literary ventures had been timid and\r\ntentative: if this one was growing and strengthening on his hands, it\r\nmust be because the conditions were so different. He was at ease, he was\r\nsecure, he was satisfied; and he had also, for the first time since his\r\nearly youth, before his mother\xe2\x80\x99s death, the sense of having some one to\r\nlook after, some one who was his own particular care, and to whom he\r\nwas answerable for himself and his actions, as he had never felt himself\r\nanswerable to the hurried and indifferent people among whom he had\r\nchosen to live.\r\n\r\nSusy had the same standards as these people: she spoke their language,\r\nthough she understood others, she required their pleasures if she did\r\nnot revere their gods. But from the moment that she had become his\r\nproperty he had built up in himself a conception of her answering to\r\nsome deep-seated need of veneration. She was his, he had chosen her,\r\nshe had taken her place in the long line of Lansing women who had been\r\nloved, honoured, and probably deceived, by bygone Lansing men. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npretend to understand the logic of it; but the fact that she was his\r\nwife gave purpose and continuity to his scattered impulses, and a\r\nmysterious glow of consecration to his task.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice, in the first days of his marriage, he had asked himself\r\nwith a slight shiver what would happen if Susy should begin to bore\r\nhim. The thing had happened to him with other women as to whom his first\r\nemotions had not differed in intensity from those she inspired. The part\r\nhe had played in his previous love-affairs might indeed have been summed\r\nup in the memorable line: \xe2\x80\x9cI am the hunter and the prey,\xe2\x80\x9d for he had\r\ninvariably ceased to be the first only to regard himself as the second.\r\nThis experience had never ceased to cause him the liveliest pain, since\r\nhis sympathy for his pursuer was only less keen than his commiseration\r\nfor himself; but as he was always a little sorrier for himself, he had\r\nalways ended by distancing the pursuer.\r\n\r\nAll these pre-natal experiences now seemed utterly inapplicable to the\r\nnew man he had become. He could not imagine being bored by Susy--or\r\ntrying to escape from her if he were. He could not think of her as\r\nan enemy, or even as an accomplice, since accomplices are potential\r\nenemies: she was some one with whom, by some unheard-of miracle, joys\r\nabove the joys of friendship were to be tasted, but who, even through\r\nthese fleeting ecstasies, remained simply and securely his friend.\r\n\r\nThese new feelings did not affect his general attitude toward life: they\r\nmerely confirmed his faith in its ultimate \xe2\x80\x9cjolliness.\xe2\x80\x9d Never had he\r\nmore thoroughly enjoyed the things he had always enjoyed. A good dinner\r\nhad never been as good to him, a beautiful sunset as beautiful; he still\r\nrejoiced in the fact that he appreciated both with an equal acuity. He\r\nwas as proud as ever of Susy\xe2\x80\x99s cleverness and freedom from prejudice:\r\nshe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too \xe2\x80\x9cmodern\xe2\x80\x9d for him now that she was his. He shared to\r\nthe full her passionate enjoyment of the present, and all her feverish\r\neagerness to make it last. He knew when she was thinking of ways of\r\nextending their golden opportunity, and he secretly thought with her,\r\nwondering what new means they could devise. He was thankful that Ellie\r\nVanderlyn was still absent, and began to hope they might have the palace\r\nto themselves for the remainder of the summer. If they did, he would\r\nhave time to finish his book, and Susy to lay up a little interest on\r\ntheir wedding cheques; and thus their enchanted year might conceivably\r\nbe prolonged to two.\r\n\r\nLate as the season was, their presence and Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s in Venice had\r\nalready drawn thither several wandering members of their set. It was\r\ncharacteristic of these indifferent but agglutinative people that they\r\ncould never remain long parted from each other without a dim sense of\r\nuneasiness. Lansing was familiar with the feeling. He had known slight\r\ntwinges of it himself, and had often ministered to its qualms in others.\r\nIt was hardly stronger than the faint gnawing which recalls the tea-hour\r\nto one who has lunched well and is sure of dining as abundantly; but it\r\ngave a purpose to the purposeless, and helped many hesitating spirits\r\nover the annual difficulty of deciding between Deauville and St. Moritz,\r\nBiarritz and Capri.\r\n\r\nNick was not surprised to learn that it was becoming the fashion, that\r\nsummer, to pop down to Venice and take a look at the Lansings. Streffy\r\nhad set the example, and Streffy\xe2\x80\x99s example was always followed. And then\r\nSusy\xe2\x80\x99s marriage was still a subject of sympathetic speculation. People\r\nknew the story of the wedding cheques, and were interested in seeing\r\nhow long they could be made to last. It was going to be the thing,\r\nthat year, to help prolong the honey-moon by pressing houses on the\r\nadventurous couple. Before June was over a band of friends were basking\r\nwith the Lansings on the Lido.\r\n\r\nNick found himself unexpectedly disturbed by their arrival. To avoid\r\ncomment and banter he put his book aside and forbade Susy to speak\r\nof it, explaining to her that he needed an interval of rest. His wife\r\ninstantly and exaggeratedly adopted this view, guarding him from the\r\ntemptation to work as jealously as she had discouraged him from idling;\r\nand he was careful not to let her find out that the change in his habits\r\ncoincided with his having reached a difficult point in his book. But\r\nthough he was not sorry to stop writing he found himself unexpectedly\r\noppressed by the weight of his leisure. For the first time communal\r\ndawdling had lost its charm for him; not because his fellow dawdlers\r\nwere less congenial than of old, but because in the interval he had\r\nknown something so immeasurably better. He had always felt himself to be\r\nthe superior of his habitual associates, but now the advantage was too\r\ngreat: really, in a sense, it was hardly fair to them.\r\n\r\nHe had flattered himself that Susy would share this feeling; but he\r\nperceived with annoyance that the arrival of their friends heightened\r\nher animation. It was as if the inward glow which had given her a new\r\nbeauty were now refracted upon her by the presence of the very people\r\nthey had come to Venice to avoid.\r\n\r\nLansing was vaguely irritated; and when he asked her how she liked being\r\nwith their old crowd again his irritation was increased by her answering\r\nwith a laugh that she only hoped the poor dears didn\xe2\x80\x99t see too plainly\r\nhow they bored her. The patent insincerity of the reply was a shock to\r\nLansing. He knew that Susy was not really bored, and he understood that\r\nshe had simply guessed his feelings and instinctively adopted them: that\r\nhenceforth she was always going to think as he thought. To confirm this\r\nfear he said carelessly: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, all the same, it\xe2\x80\x99s rather jolly knocking\r\nabout with them again for a bit;\xe2\x80\x9d and she answered at once, and with\r\nequal conviction: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? The old darlings--all the same!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA fear of the future again laid its cold touch on Lansing. Susy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nindependence and self-sufficiency had been among her chief attractions;\r\nif she were to turn into an echo their delicious duet ran the risk of\r\nbecoming the dullest of monologues. He forgot that five minutes earlier\r\nhe had resented her being glad to see their friends, and for a moment\r\nhe found himself leaning dizzily over that insoluble riddle of the\r\nsentimental life: that to be differed with is exasperating, and to be\r\nagreed with monotonous.\r\n\r\nOnce more he began to wonder if he were not fundamentally unfitted for\r\nthe married state; and was saved from despair only by remembering that\r\nSusy\xe2\x80\x99s subjection to his moods was not likely to last. But even then\r\nit never occurred to him to reflect that his apprehensions were\r\nsuperfluous, since their tie was avowedly a temporary one. Of the\r\nspecial understanding on which their marriage had been based not a trace\r\nremained in his thoughts of her; the idea that he or she might ever\r\nrenounce each other for their mutual good had long since dwindled to the\r\nghost of an old joke.\r\n\r\nIt was borne in on him, after a week or two of unbroken sociability,\r\nthat of all his old friends it was the Mortimer Hickses who bored him\r\nthe least. The Hickses had left the Ibis for an apartment in a vast\r\ndilapidated palace near the Canareggio. They had hired the apartment\r\nfrom a painter (one of their newest discoveries), and they put up\r\nphilosophically with the absence of modern conveniences in order to\r\nsecure the inestimable advantage of \xe2\x80\x9catmosphere.\xe2\x80\x9d In this privileged\r\nair they gathered about them their usual mixed company of quiet\r\nstudious people and noisy exponents of new theories, themselves totally\r\nunconscious of the disparity between their different guests, and\r\nbeamingly convinced that at last they were seated at the source of\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\nIn old days Lansing would have got half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s amusement, followed\r\nby a long evening of boredom, from the sight of Mrs. Hicks, vast and\r\njewelled, seated between a quiet-looking professor of archaeology and a\r\nlarge-browed composer, or the high priest of a new dance-step, while\r\nMr. Hicks, beaming above his vast white waistcoat, saw to it that the\r\nchampagne flowed more abundantly than the talk, and the bright young\r\nsecretaries industriously \xe2\x80\x9ckept up\xe2\x80\x9d with the dizzy cross-current of\r\nprophecy and erudition. But a change had come over Lansing. Hitherto\r\nit was in contrast to his own friends that the Hickses had seemed most\r\ninsufferable; now it was as an escape from these same friends that they\r\nhad become not only sympathetic but even interesting. It was something,\r\nafter all, to be with people who did not regard Venice simply as\r\naffording exceptional opportunities for bathing and adultery, but who\r\nwere reverently if confusedly aware that they were in the presence of\r\nsomething unique and ineffable, and determined to make the utmost of\r\ntheir privilege.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself one evening, as his eyes wandered, with\r\nsomewhat of a convalescent\xe2\x80\x99s simple joy, from one to another of their\r\nlarge confiding faces, \xe2\x80\x9cafter all, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got a religion....\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nphrase struck him, in the moment of using it, as indicating a new\r\nelement in his own state of mind, and as being, in fact, the key to his\r\nnew feeling about the Hickses. Their muddled ardour for great things\r\nwas related to his own new view of the universe: the people who felt,\r\nhowever dimly, the wonder and weight of life must ever after be nearer\r\nto him than those to whom it was estimated solely by one\xe2\x80\x99s balance at\r\nthe bank. He supposed, on reflexion, that that was what he meant when he\r\nthought of the Hickses as having \xe2\x80\x9ca religion\xe2\x80\x9d....\r\n\r\nA few days later, his well-being was unexpectedly disturbed by the\r\narrival of Fred Gillow. Lansing had always felt a tolerant liking for\r\nGillow, a large smiling silent young man with an intense and serious\r\ndesire to miss nothing attainable by one of his fortune and standing.\r\nWhat use he made of his experiences, Lansing, who had always gone into\r\nhis own modest adventures rather thoroughly, had never been able to\r\nguess; but he had always suspected the prodigal Fred of being no more\r\nthan a well-disguised looker-on. Now for the first time he began to view\r\nhim with another eye. The Gillows were, in fact, the one uneasy point in\r\nNick\xe2\x80\x99s conscience. He and Susy from the first, had talked of them less\r\nthan of any other members of their group: they had tacitly avoided the\r\nname from the day on which Susy had come to Lansing\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings to say\r\nthat Ursula Gillow had asked her to renounce him, till that other day,\r\njust before their marriage, when she had met him with the rapturous cry:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s our first wedding present! Such a thumping big cheque from Fred\r\nand Ursula!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPlenty of sympathizing people were ready, Lansing knew, to tell him just\r\nwhat had happened in the interval between those two dates; but he had\r\ntaken care not to ask. He had even affected an initiation so complete\r\nthat the friends who burned to enlighten him were discouraged by his so\r\nobviously knowing more than they; and gradually he had worked himself\r\naround to their view, and had taken it for granted that he really did.\r\n\r\nNow he perceived that he knew nothing at all, and that the \xe2\x80\x9cHullo, old\r\nFred!\xe2\x80\x9d with which Susy hailed Gillow\xe2\x80\x99s arrival might be either the usual\r\ntribal welcome--since they were all \xe2\x80\x9cold,\xe2\x80\x9d and all nicknamed, in their\r\nprivate jargon--or a greeting that concealed inscrutable depths of\r\ncomplicity.\r\n\r\nSusy was visibly glad to see Gillow; but she was glad of everything just\r\nthen, and so glad to show her gladness! The fact disarmed her husband\r\nand made him ashamed of his uneasiness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to have thought this\r\nall out sooner, or else you ought to chuck thinking of it at all,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n was the sound but ineffectual advice he gave himself on the day after\r\nGillow\xe2\x80\x99s arrival; and immediately set to work to rethink the whole\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nFred Gillow showed no consciousness of disturbing any one\xe2\x80\x99s peace of\r\nmind. Day after day he sprawled for hours on the Lido sands, his arms\r\nfolded under his head, listening to Streffy\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense and watching Susy\r\nbetween sleepy lids; but he betrayed no desire to see her alone, or\r\nto draw her into talk apart from the others. More than ever he seemed\r\ncontent to be the gratified spectator of a costly show got up for his\r\nprivate entertainment. It was not until he heard her, one morning,\r\ngrumble a little at the increasing heat and the menace of mosquitoes,\r\nthat he said, quite as if they had talked the matter over long before,\r\nand finally settled it: \xe2\x80\x9cThe moor will be ready any time after the first\r\nof August.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNick fancied that Susy coloured a little, and drew herself up more\r\ndefiantly than usual as she sent a pebble skimming across the dying\r\nripples at their feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be a lot cooler in Scotland,\xe2\x80\x9d Fred added, with what, for him,\r\nwas an unusual effort at explicitness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, shall we?\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted gaily; and added with an air of mystery\r\nand importance, pivoting about on her high heels: \xe2\x80\x9cNick\xe2\x80\x99s got work to do\r\nhere. It will probably keep us all summer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWork? Rot! You\xe2\x80\x99ll die of the smells.\xe2\x80\x9d Gillow stared perplexedly skyward\r\nfrom under his tilted hat-brim; and then brought out, as from the depth\r\nof a rankling grievance: \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was all understood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d Nick asked his wife that night, as they re-entered Ellie\xe2\x80\x99s cool\r\ndrawing-room after a late dinner at the Lido, \xe2\x80\x9cdid Gillow think it was\r\nunderstood that we were going to his moor in August?\xe2\x80\x9d He was conscious\r\nof the oddness of speaking of their friend by his surname, and reddened\r\nat his blunder.\r\n\r\nSusy had let her lace cloak slide to her feet, and stood before him\r\nin the faintly-lit room, slim and shimmering-white through black\r\ntransparencies.\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyebrows carelessly. \xe2\x80\x9cI told you long ago he\xe2\x80\x99d asked us\r\nthere for August.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me you\xe2\x80\x99d accepted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled as if he had said something as simple as Fred. \xe2\x80\x9cI accepted\r\neverything--from everybody!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat could he answer? It was the very principle on which their bargain\r\nhad been struck. And if he were to say: \xe2\x80\x9cAh, but this is different,\r\nbecause I\xe2\x80\x99m jealous of Gillow,\xe2\x80\x9d what light would such an answer shed on\r\nhis past? The time for being jealous--if so antiquated an attitude were\r\non any ground defensible--would have been before his marriage, and before\r\nthe acceptance of the bounties which had helped to make it possible. He\r\nwondered a little now that in those days such scruples had not troubled\r\nhim. His inconsistency irritated him, and increased his irritation\r\nagainst Gillow. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose he thinks he owns us!\xe2\x80\x9d he grumbled inwardly.\r\n\r\nHe had thrown himself into an armchair, and Susy, advancing across the\r\nshining arabesques of the floor, slid down at his feet, pressed her\r\nslender length against him, and whispered with lifted face and lips\r\nclose to his: \xe2\x80\x9cWe needn\xe2\x80\x99t ever go anywhere you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to.\xe2\x80\x9d For\r\nonce her submission was sweet, and folding her close he whispered back\r\nthrough his kiss: \xe2\x80\x9cNot there, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn her response to his embrace he felt the acquiescence of her whole\r\nhappy self in whatever future he decided on, if only it gave them enough\r\nof such moments as this; and as they held each other fast in silence his\r\ndoubts and distrust began to seem like a silly injustice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us stay here as long as ever Ellie will let us,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as if the\r\nshadowy walls and shining floors were a magic boundary drawn about his\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nShe murmured her assent and stood up, stretching her sleepy arm above\r\nher shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cHow dreadfully late it is.... Will you unhook me?... Oh,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a telegram.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe picked it up from the table, and tearing it open stared a moment at\r\nthe message. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s from Ellie. She\xe2\x80\x99s coming to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned to the window and strayed out onto the balcony. Nick followed\r\nher with enlacing arm. The canal below them lay in moonless shadow,\r\nbarred with a few lingering lights. A last snatch of gondola-music came\r\nfrom far off, carried upward on a sultry gust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear old Ellie. All the same... I wish all this belonged to you and\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d Susy sighed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was not Mrs. Vanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s fault if, after her arrival, her palace\r\nseemed to belong any less to the Lansings.\r\n\r\nShe arrived in a mood of such general benevolence that it was impossible\r\nfor Susy, when they finally found themselves alone, to make her view\r\neven her own recent conduct in any but the most benevolent light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you\xe2\x80\x99d be the veriest angel about it all, darling, because I knew\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d understand me--especially now,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared, her slim hands\r\nin Susy\xe2\x80\x99s, her big eyes (so like Clarissa\xe2\x80\x99s) resplendent with past\r\npleasures and future plans.\r\n\r\nThe expression of her confidence was unexpectedly distasteful to Susy\r\nLansing, who had never lent so cold an ear to such warm avowals. She had\r\nalways imagined that being happy one\xe2\x80\x99s self made one--as Mrs. Vanderlyn\r\nappeared to assume--more tolerant of the happiness of others, of however\r\ndoubtful elements composed; and she was almost ashamed of responding so\r\nlanguidly to her friend\xe2\x80\x99s outpourings. But she herself had no desire to\r\nconfide her bliss to Ellie; and why should not Ellie observe a similar\r\nreticence?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was all so perfect--you see, dearest, I was meant to be happy,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n that lady continued, as if the possession of so unusual a characteristic\r\nsingled her out for special privileges.\r\n\r\nSusy, with a certain sharpness, responded that she had always supposed\r\nwe all were.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, dearest: not governesses and mothers-in-law and companions, and\r\nthat sort of people. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know how if they tried. But you and\r\nI, darling--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t consider myself in any way exceptional,\xe2\x80\x9d Susy intervened.\r\nShe longed to add: \xe2\x80\x9cNot in your way, at any rate--\xe2\x80\x9d but a few minutes\r\nearlier Mrs. Vanderlyn had told her that the palace was at her disposal\r\nfor the rest of the summer, and that she herself was only going to perch\r\nthere--if they\xe2\x80\x99d let her!--long enough to gather up her things and\r\nstart for St. Moritz. The memory of this announcement had the effect of\r\ncurbing Susy\xe2\x80\x99s irony, and of making her shift the conversation to the\r\nsafer if scarcely less absorbing topic of the number of day and evening\r\ndresses required for a season at St. Moritz.\r\n\r\nAs she listened to Mrs. Vanderlyn--no less eloquent on this theme\r\nthan on the other--Susy began to measure the gulf between her past and\r\npresent. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the life I used to lead; these are the things I used\r\nto live for,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, as she stood before the outspread glories of\r\nMrs. Vanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe. Not that she did not still care: she could\r\nnot look at Ellie\xe2\x80\x99s laces and silks and furs without picturing herself\r\nin them, and wondering by what new miracle of management she could give\r\nherself the air of being dressed by the same consummate artists. But\r\nthese had become minor interests: the past few months had given her a\r\nnew perspective, and the thing that most puzzled and disconcerted her\r\nabout Ellie was the fact that love and finery and bridge and dining-out\r\nwere seemingly all on the same plane to her.\r\n\r\nThe inspection of the dresses lasted a long time, and was marked by\r\nmany fluctuations of mood on the part of Mrs. Vanderlyn, who passed\r\nfrom comparative hopefulness to despair at the total inadequacy of her\r\nwardrobe. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do to go to St. Moritz looking like a frump, and\r\nyet there was no time to get anything sent from Paris, and, whatever she\r\ndid, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to show herself in any dowdy re-arrangements done\r\nat home. But suddenly light broke on her, and she clasped her hands\r\nfor joy. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Nelson\xe2\x80\x99ll bring them--I\xe2\x80\x99d forgotten all about Nelson!\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99ll be just time if I wire to him at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Nelson going to join you at St. Moritz?\xe2\x80\x9d Susy asked, surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeavens, no! He\xe2\x80\x99s coming here to pick up Clarissa and take her to some\r\nstuffy cure in Austria with his mother. It\xe2\x80\x99s too lucky: there\xe2\x80\x99s just\r\ntime to telegraph him to bring my things. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to wait for him;\r\nbut it won\xe2\x80\x99t delay me more than day or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy\xe2\x80\x99s heart sank. She was not much afraid of Ellie alone, but Ellie and\r\nNelson together formed an incalculable menace. No one could tell what\r\nspark of truth might dash from their collision. Susy felt that she could\r\ndeal with the two dangers separately and successively, but not together\r\nand simultaneously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Ellie, why should you wait for Nelson? I\xe2\x80\x99m certain to find someone\r\nhere who\xe2\x80\x99s going to St. Moritz and will take your things if he brings\r\nthem. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pity to risk losing your rooms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis argument appealed for a moment to Mrs. Vanderlyn. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntrue; they say all the hotels are jammed. You dear, you\xe2\x80\x99re always\r\nso practical!\xe2\x80\x9d She clasped Susy to her scented bosom. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you know,\r\ndarling, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad to get rid of me--you and Nick! Oh,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t be hypocritical and say \xe2\x80\x98Nonsense!\xe2\x80\x99 You see, I understand... I\r\nused to think of you so often, you two... during those blessed weeks\r\nwhen we two were alone....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sudden tears, brimming over Ellie\xe2\x80\x99s lovely eyes, and threatening to\r\nmake the blue circles below them run into the adjoining carmine, filled\r\nSusy with compunction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor thing--oh, poor thing!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought; and hearing herself called\r\nby Nick, who was waiting to take her out for their usual sunset on the\r\nlagoon, she felt a wave of pity for the deluded creature who would\r\nnever taste that highest of imaginable joys. \xe2\x80\x9cBut all the same,\xe2\x80\x9d Susy\r\nreflected, as she hurried down to her husband, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad I persuaded her\r\nnot to wait for Nelson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome days had elapsed since Susy and Nick had had a sunset to\r\nthemselves, and in the interval Susy had once again learned the superior\r\nquality of the sympathy that held them together. She now viewed all the\r\nrest of life as no more than a show: a jolly show which it would have\r\nbeen a thousand pities to miss, but which, if the need arose, they could\r\nget up and leave at any moment--provided that they left it together.\r\n\r\nIn the dusk, while their prow slid over inverted palaces, and through\r\nthe scent of hidden gardens, she leaned against him and murmured, her\r\nmind returning to the recent scene with Ellie: \xe2\x80\x9cNick, should you hate me\r\ndreadfully if I had no clothes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer husband was kindling a cigarette, and the match lit up the grin\r\nwith which he answered: \xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear, have I ever shown the slightest\r\nsymptom--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, rubbish! When a woman says: \xe2\x80\x98No clothes,\xe2\x80\x99 she means: \xe2\x80\x98Not the right\r\nclothes.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took a meditative puff. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been going over Ellie\xe2\x80\x99s finery\r\nwith her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes: all those trunks and trunks full. And she finds she\xe2\x80\x99s got nothing\r\nfor St. Moritz!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, drowsy with content, and manifesting but a\r\nlanguid interest in the subject of Mrs. Vanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly fancy--she very nearly decided to stop over for Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s arrival\r\nnext week, so that he might bring her two or three more trunkfuls from\r\nParis. But mercifully I\xe2\x80\x99ve managed to persuade her that it would be\r\nfoolish to wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy felt a hardly perceptible shifting of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s lounging body,\r\nand was aware, through all her watchful tentacles, of a widening of his\r\nhalf-closed lids.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou \xe2\x80\x98managed\xe2\x80\x99--?\xe2\x80\x9d She fancied he paused on the word ironically. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nwhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy--what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy on earth should you try to prevent Ellie\xe2\x80\x99s waiting for Nelson, if\r\nfor once in her life she wants to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy, conscious of reddening suddenly, drew back as though the leap\r\nof her tell-tale heart might have penetrated the blue flannel shoulder\r\nagainst which she leaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, dearest--!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured; but with a sudden doggedness he\r\nrenewed his \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause she\xe2\x80\x99s in such a fever to get to St. Moritz--and in such a funk\r\nlest the hotel shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep her rooms,\xe2\x80\x9d Susy somewhat breathlessly\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh--I see.\xe2\x80\x9d Nick paused again. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a devoted friend, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an odd question! There\xe2\x80\x99s hardly anyone I\xe2\x80\x99ve reason to be more\r\ndevoted to than Ellie,\xe2\x80\x9d his wife answered; and she felt his contrite\r\nclasp on her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDarling! No; nor I--. Or more grateful to for leaving us alone in this\r\nheaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDimness had fallen on the waters, and her lifted lips met his bending\r\nones.\r\n\r\nTrailing late into dinner that evening, Ellie announced that, after all,\r\nshe had decided it was safest to wait for Nelson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should simply worry myself ill if I weren\xe2\x80\x99t sure of getting my\r\nthings,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in the tone of tender solicitude with which she\r\nalways discussed her own difficulties. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, people who deny\r\nthemselves everything do get warped and bitter, don\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d she argued\r\nplaintively, her lovely eyes wandering from one to the other of her\r\nassembled friends.\r\n\r\nStrefford remarked gravely that it was the complaint which had fatally\r\nundermined his own health; and in the laugh that followed the party\r\ndrifted into the great vaulted dining-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind your laughing at me, Streffy darling,\xe2\x80\x9d his hostess\r\nretorted, pressing his arm against her own; and Susy, receiving the\r\nshock of their rapidly exchanged glance, said to herself, with a sharp\r\ntwinge of apprehension: \xe2\x80\x9cOf course Streffy knows everything; he showed\r\nno surprise at finding Ellie away when he arrived. And if he knows,\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s to prevent Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s finding out?\xe2\x80\x9d For Strefford, in a mood of\r\nmischief, was no more to be trusted than a malicious child.\r\n\r\nSusy instantly resolved to risk speaking to him, if need be even\r\nbetraying to him the secret of the letters. Only by revealing the depth\r\nof her own danger could she hope to secure his silence.\r\n\r\nOn the balcony, late in the evening, while the others were listening\r\nindoors to the low modulations of a young composer who had embroidered\r\nhis fancies on Browning\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cToccata,\xe2\x80\x9d Susy found her chance. Strefford,\r\nunsummoned, had followed her out, and stood silently smoking at her\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Streff--oh, why should you and I make mysteries to each\r\nother?\xe2\x80\x9d she suddenly began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, indeed: but do we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy glanced back at the group around the piano. \xe2\x80\x9cAbout Ellie, I\r\nmean--and Nelson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord! Ellie and Nelson? You call that a mystery? I should as soon apply\r\nthe term to one of the million candle-power advertisements that adorn\r\nyour native thoroughfares.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes. But--\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped again. Had she not tacitly promised Ellie\r\nnot to speak?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Susan, what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d Strefford asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I do, then: you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid that, if Ellie and Nelson meet here,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll blurt out something--injudicious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d Susy cried with conviction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then--who will! I trust that superhuman child not to. And you and\r\nI and Nick--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped, interrupting him, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s just it. Nick doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow... doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even suspect. And if he did....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrefford flung away his cigar and turned to scrutinize her. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee--hanged if I do. What business is it of any of us, after all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat, of course, was the old view that cloaked connivance in an air of\r\ndecency. But to Susy it no longer carried conviction, and she hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Nick should find out that I know....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord--doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he know that you know? After all, I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nthe first time--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe remained silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first time you\xe2\x80\x99ve received confidences--from married friends. Does\r\nNick suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ve lived even to your tender age without... Hang it,\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s come over you, child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat had, indeed, that she could make clear to him? And yet more than\r\never she felt the need of having him securely on her side. Once his word\r\nwas pledged, he was safe: otherwise there was no limit to his capacity\r\nfor wilful harmfulness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Streff, you and I know that Ellie hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been away for a\r\ncure; and that if poor Clarissa was sworn to secrecy it was not because\r\nit \xe2\x80\x98worries father\xe2\x80\x99 to think that mother needs to take care of her\r\nhealth.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused, hating herself for the ironic note she had tried to\r\nsound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--?\xe2\x80\x9d he questioned, from the depths of the chair into which he had\r\nsunk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Nick doesn\xe2\x80\x99t... doesn\xe2\x80\x99t dream of it. If he knew that we owed our\r\nsummer here to... to my knowing....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrefford sat silent: she felt his astonished stare through the\r\ndarkness. \xe2\x80\x9cJove!\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, with a low whistle Susy bent over the\r\nbalustrade, her heart thumping against the stone rail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was left of soul, I wonder--?\xe2\x80\x9d the young composer\xe2\x80\x99s voice shrilled\r\nthrough the open windows.\r\n\r\nStrefford sank into another silence, from which he roused himself only\r\nas Susy turned back toward the lighted threshold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see it through between us; you and I--and\r\nClarissa,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with his rasping laugh, rising to follow her. He\r\ncaught her hand and gave it a short pressure as they re-entered the\r\ndrawing-room, where Ellie was saying plaintively to Fred Gillow: \xe2\x80\x9cI can\r\nnever hear that thing sung without wanting to cry like a baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nNELSON VANDERLYN, still in his travelling clothes, paused on the\r\nthreshold of his own dining-room and surveyed the scene with pardonable\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nHe was a short round man, with a grizzled head, small facetious eyes and\r\na large and credulous smile.\r\n\r\nAt the luncheon table sat his wife, between Charlie Strefford and Nick\r\nLansing. Next to Strefford, perched on her high chair, Clarissa throned\r\nin infant beauty, while Susy Lansing cut up a peach for her. Through\r\nwide orange awnings the sun slanted in upon the white-clad group.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--well--well! So I\xe2\x80\x99ve caught you at it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the happy father,\r\nwhose inveterate habit it was to address his wife and friends as if he\r\nhad surprised them at an inopportune moment. Stealing up from behind, he\r\nlifted his daughter into the air, while a chorus of \xe2\x80\x9cHello, old Nelson,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n hailed his appearance.\r\n\r\nIt was two or three years since Nick Lansing had seen Mr. Vanderlyn, who\r\nwas now the London representative of the big New York bank of Vanderlyn\r\n& Co., and had exchanged his sumptuous house in Fifth Avenue for\r\nanother, more sumptuous still, in Mayfair; and the young man looked\r\ncuriously and attentively at his host.\r\n\r\nMr. Vanderlyn had grown older and stouter, but his face still kept\r\nits look of somewhat worn optimism. He embraced his wife, greeted Susy\r\naffectionately, and distributed cordial hand-grasps to the two men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, suddenly noticing a pearl and coral trinket\r\nhanging from Clarissa\xe2\x80\x99s neck. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s been giving my daughter jewellery,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d like to know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Streffy did--just think, father! Because I said I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have it\r\nthan a book, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarissa lucidly explained, her arms tight about\r\nher father\xe2\x80\x99s neck, her beaming eyes on Strefford.\r\n\r\nNelson Vanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s own eyes took on the look of shrewdness which came\r\ninto them whenever there was a question of material values.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Streffy? Caught you at it, eh? Upon my soul-spoiling the brat\r\nlike that! You\xe2\x80\x99d no business to, my dear chap-a lovely baroque pearl--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he protested, with the half-apologetic tone of the rich man embarrassed\r\nby too costly a gift from an impecunious friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t I? Why? Because it\xe2\x80\x99s too good for Clarissa, or too expensive\r\nfor me? Of course you daren\xe2\x80\x99t imply the first; and as for me--I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a\r\nwindfall, and am blowing it in on the ladies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrefford, Lansing had noticed, always used American slang when he was\r\nslightly at a loss, and wished to divert attention from the main point.\r\nBut why was he embarrassed, whose attention did he wish to divert, It\r\nwas plain that Vanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s protest had been merely formal: like most of\r\nthe wealthy, he had only the dimmest notion of what money represented\r\nto the poor. But it was unusual for Strefford to give any one a present,\r\nand especially an expensive one: perhaps that was what had fixed\r\nVanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA windfall?\xe2\x80\x9d he gaily repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, a tiny one: I was offered a thumping rent for my little place at\r\nComo, and dashed over here to squander my millions with the rest of\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strefford imperturbably.\r\n\r\nVanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s look immediately became interested and sympathetic.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat--the scene of the honey-moon?\xe2\x80\x9d He included Nick and Susy in his\r\nfriendly smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so: the reward of virtue. I say, give me a cigar, will you, old\r\nman, I left some awfully good ones at Como, worse luck--and I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\ntelling you that Ellie\xe2\x80\x99s no judge of tobacco, and that Nick\xe2\x80\x99s too far\r\ngone in bliss to care what he smokes,\xe2\x80\x9d Strefford grumbled, stretching a\r\nhand toward his host\xe2\x80\x99s cigar-case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do like jewellery best,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarissa murmured, hugging her father.\r\n\r\nNelson Vanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s first word to his wife had been that he had\r\nbrought her all her toggery; and she had welcomed him with appropriate\r\nenthusiasm. In fact, to the lookers-on her joy at seeing him seemed\r\nrather too patently in proportion to her satisfaction at getting her\r\nclothes. But no such suspicion appeared to mar Mr. Vanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s happiness\r\nin being, for once, and for nearly twenty-four hours, under the same\r\nroof with his wife and child. He did not conceal his regret at having\r\npromised his mother to join her the next day; and added, with a wistful\r\nglance at Ellie: \xe2\x80\x9cIf only I\xe2\x80\x99d known you meant to wait for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut being a man of duty, in domestic as well as business affairs, he did\r\nnot even consider the possibility of disappointing the exacting old lady\r\nto whom he owed his being. \xe2\x80\x9cMother cares for so few people,\xe2\x80\x9d he used to\r\nsay, not without a touch of filial pride in the parental exclusiveness,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat I have to be with her rather more than if she were more sociable\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\nand with smiling resignation he gave orders that Clarissa should be\r\nready to start the next evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd meanwhile,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll have all the good time that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the party seemed united in the desire to further this\r\nresolve; and it was settled that as soon as Mr. Vanderlyn had despatched\r\na hasty luncheon, his wife, Clarissa and Susy should carry him off for a\r\ntea-picnic at Torcello. They did not even suggest that Strefford or Nick\r\nshould be of the party, or that any of the other young men of the group\r\nshould be summoned; as Susy said, Nelson wanted to go off alone with his\r\nharem. And Lansing and Strefford were left to watch the departure of the\r\nhappy Pasha ensconced between attentive beauties.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--that\xe2\x80\x99s what you call being married!\xe2\x80\x9d Strefford commented, waving\r\nhis battered Panama at Clarissa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d Lansing laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does. But do you know--\xe2\x80\x9d Strefford paused and swung about on his\r\ncompanion--\xe2\x80\x9cdo you know, when the Rude Awakening comes, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care to\r\nbe there. I believe there\xe2\x80\x99ll be some crockery broken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d Lansing answered indifferently. He wandered away to\r\nhis own room, leaving Strefford to philosophize to his pipe.\r\n\r\nLansing had always known about poor old Nelson: who hadn\xe2\x80\x99t, except poor\r\nold Nelson? The case had once seemed amusing because so typical; now, it\r\nrather irritated Nick that Vanderlyn should be so complete an ass. But\r\nhe would be off the next day, and so would Ellie, and then, for many\r\nenchanted weeks, the palace would once more be the property of Nick and\r\nSusy. Of all the people who came and went in it, they were the only ones\r\nwho appreciated it, or knew how it was meant to be lived in; and that\r\nmade it theirs in the only valid sense. In this light it became easy to\r\nregard the Vanderlyns as mere transient intruders.\r\n\r\nHaving relegated them to this convenient distance, Lansing shut himself\r\nup with his book. He had returned to it with fresh energy after his few\r\nweeks of holiday-making, and was determined to finish it quickly. He did\r\nnot expect that it would bring in much money; but if it were moderately\r\nsuccessful it might give him an opening in the reviews and magazines,\r\nand in that case he meant to abandon archaeology for novels, since\r\nit was only as a purveyor of fiction that he could count on earning a\r\nliving for himself and Susy.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon he laid down his pen and wandered out of doors.\r\nHe loved the increasing heat of the Venetian summer, the bruised\r\npeach-tints of worn house-fronts, the enamelling of sunlight on dark\r\ngreen canals, the smell of half-decayed fruits and flowers thickening\r\nthe languid air. What visions he could build, if he dared, of being\r\ntucked away with Susy in the attic of some tumble-down palace, above\r\na jade-green waterway, with a terrace overhanging a scrap of neglected\r\ngarden--and cheques from the publishers dropping in at convenient\r\nintervals! Why should they not settle in Venice if he pulled it off!\r\n\r\nHe found himself before the church of the Scalzi, and pushing open the\r\nleathern door wandered up the nave under the whirl of rose-and-lemon\r\nangels in Tiepolo\xe2\x80\x99s great vault. It was not a church in which one was\r\nlikely to run across sight-seers; but he presently remarked a young lady\r\nstanding alone near the choir, and assiduously applying her field-glass\r\nto the celestial vortex, from which she occasionally glanced down at an\r\nopen manual.\r\n\r\nAs Lansing\xe2\x80\x99s step sounded on the pavement, the young lady, turning,\r\nrevealed herself as Miss Hicks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh--you like this too? It\xe2\x80\x99s several centuries out of your line, though,\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t it!\xe2\x80\x9d Nick asked as they shook hands.\r\n\r\nShe gazed at him gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t one like things that are out\r\nof one\xe2\x80\x99s line?\xe2\x80\x9d she answered; and he agreed, with a laugh, that it was\r\noften an incentive.\r\n\r\nShe continued to fix her grave eyes on him, and after one or two remarks\r\nabout the Tiepolos he perceived that she was feeling her way toward a\r\nsubject of more personal interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to see you alone,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at length, with an abruptness that\r\nmight have seemed awkward had it not been so completely unconscious.\r\nShe turned toward a cluster of straw chairs, and signed to Nick to seat\r\nhimself beside her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI seldom do,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with the serious smile that made her heavy\r\nface almost handsome; and she went on, giving him no time to protest: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwanted to speak to you--to explain about father\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to go with\r\nus to Persia and Turkestan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo explain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. You found the letter when you arrived here just after your\r\nmarriage, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you? You must have thought it odd, our asking you just\r\nthen; but we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard that you were married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I guessed as much: it happened very quietly, and I was remiss about\r\nannouncing it, even to old friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLansing frowned. His thoughts had wandered away to the evening when he\r\nhad found Mrs. Hicks\xe2\x80\x99s letter in the mail awaiting him at Venice.\r\nThe day was associated in his mind with the ridiculous and mortifying\r\nepisode of the cigars--the expensive cigars that Susy had wanted to\r\ncarry away from Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s villa. Their brief exchange of views on the\r\nsubject had left the first blur on the perfect surface of his happiness,\r\nand he still felt an uncomfortable heat at the remembrance. For a few\r\nhours the prospect of life with Susy had seemed unendurable; and it was\r\njust at that moment that he had found the letter from Mrs. Hicks, with\r\nits almost irresistible invitation. If only her daughter had known how\r\nnearly he had accepted it!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a dreadful temptation,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo go with us? Then why--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, everything\xe2\x80\x99s different now: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to stick to my writing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Hicks still bent on him the same unblinking scrutiny. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes that\r\nmean that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to give up your real work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy real work--archaeology?\xe2\x80\x9d He smiled again to hide a twitch of regret.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it hardly produces a living wage; and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to think\r\nof that.\xe2\x80\x9d He coloured suddenly, as if suspecting that Miss Hicks might\r\nconsider the avowal an opening for he hardly knew what ponderous\r\noffer of aid. The Hicks munificence was too uncalculating not to be\r\noccasionally oppressive. But looking at her again he saw that her eyes\r\nwere full of tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was your vocation,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo did I. But life comes along, and upsets things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I understand. There may be things--worth giving up all other things\r\nfor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nick with beaming emphasis.\r\n\r\nHe was conscious that Miss Hicks\xe2\x80\x99s eyes demanded of him even more than\r\nthis sweeping affirmation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your novel may fail,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with her odd harshness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may--it probably will,\xe2\x80\x9d he agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if one stopped to consider\r\nsuch possibilities--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you have to, with a wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear Coral--how old are you? Not twenty?\xe2\x80\x9d he questioned, laying\r\na brotherly hand on hers.\r\n\r\nShe stared at him a moment, and sprang up clumsily from her chair. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwas never young... if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you mean. It\xe2\x80\x99s lucky, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, that\r\nmy parents gave me such a grand education? Because, you see, art\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nwonderful resource.\xe2\x80\x9d (She pronounced it RE-source.)\r\n\r\nHe continued to look at her kindly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t need it--or any\r\nother--when you grow young, as you will some day,\xe2\x80\x9d he assured her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean, when I fall in love? But I am in love--Oh, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nEldorada and Mr. Beck!\xe2\x80\x9d She broke off with a jerk, signalling with her\r\nfield-glass to the pair who had just appeared at the farther end of the\r\nnave. \xe2\x80\x9cI told them that if they\xe2\x80\x99d meet me here to-day I\xe2\x80\x99d try to make\r\nthem understand Tiepolo. Because, you see, at home we never really\r\nhave understood Tiepolo; and Mr. Beck and Eldorada are the only ones to\r\nrealize it. Mr. Buttles simply won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d She turned to Lansing and held\r\nout her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI am in love,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cand that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nreason why I find art such a RE source.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe restored her eye-glasses, opened her manual, and strode across the\r\nchurch to the expectant neophytes.\r\n\r\nLansing, looking after her, wondered for half a moment whether Mr. Beck\r\nwere the object of this apparently unrequited sentiment; then, with a\r\nqueer start of introspection, abruptly decided that, no, he certainly\r\nwas not. But then--but then--. Well, there was no use in following up\r\nsuch conjectures.... He turned home-ward, wondering if the picnickers\r\nhad already reached Palazzo Vanderlyn.\r\n\r\nThey got back only in time for a late dinner, full of chaff and\r\nlaughter, and apparently still enchanted with each other\xe2\x80\x99s society.\r\nNelson Vanderlyn beamed on his wife, sent his daughter off to bed with a\r\nkiss, and leaning back in his armchair before the fruit-and-flower-laden\r\ntable, declared that he\xe2\x80\x99d never spent a jollier day in his life. Susy\r\nseemed to come in for a full share of his approbation, and Lansing\r\nthought that Ellie was unusually demonstrative to her friend. Strefford,\r\nfrom his hostess\xe2\x80\x99s side, glanced across now and then at young Mrs.\r\nLansing, and his glance seemed to Lansing a confidential comment on the\r\nVanderlyn raptures. But then Strefford was always having private jokes\r\nwith people or about them; and Lansing was irritated with himself for\r\nperpetually suspecting his best friends of vague complicities at his\r\nexpense. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be jealous of Streffy now--!\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded\r\nwith a grimace of self-derision.\r\n\r\nCertainly Susy looked lovely enough to justify the most irrational\r\npangs. As a girl she had been, for some people\xe2\x80\x99s taste, a trifle\r\nfine-drawn and sharp-edged; now, to her old lightness of line was added\r\na shadowy bloom, a sort of star-reflecting depth. Her movements were\r\nslower, less angular; her mouth had a needing droop, her lids seemed\r\nweighed down by their lashes; and then suddenly the old spirit would\r\nreveal itself through the new languor, like the tartness at the core\r\nof a sweet fruit. As her husband looked at her across the flowers and\r\nlights he laughed inwardly at the nothingness of all things else.\r\n\r\nVanderlyn and Clarissa left betimes the next morning; and Mrs.\r\nVanderlyn, who was to start for St. Moritz in the afternoon, devoted\r\nher last hours to anxious conferences with her maid and Susy. Strefford,\r\nwith Fred Gillow and the others, had gone for a swim at the Lido, and\r\nLansing seized the opportunity to get back to his book.\r\n\r\nThe quietness of the great echoing place gave him a foretaste of the\r\nsolitude to come. By mid-August all their party would be scattered: the\r\nHickses off on a cruise to Crete and the AEgean, Fred Gillow on the way\r\nto his moor, Strefford to stay with friends in Capri till his annual\r\nvisit to Northumberland in September. One by one the others would\r\nfollow, and Lansing and Susy be left alone in the great sun-proof\r\npalace, alone under the star-laden skies, alone with the great orange\r\nmoons--still theirs!--above the bell-tower of San Giorgio. The novel, in\r\nthat blessed quiet, would unfold itself as harmoniously as his dreams.\r\n\r\nHe wrote on, forgetful of the passing hours, till the door opened and he\r\nheard a step behind him. The next moment two hands were clasped over his\r\neyes, and the air was full of Mrs. Vanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s last new scent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou dear thing--I\xe2\x80\x99m just off, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cSusy told me you\r\nwere working, and I forbade her to call you down. She and Streffy are\r\nwaiting to take me to the station, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve run up to say good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEllie, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d Full of compunction, Lansing pushed aside his writing and\r\nstarted up; but she pressed him back into his seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! I should never forgive myself if I\xe2\x80\x99d interrupted you. I\r\noughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to have come up; Susy didn\xe2\x80\x99t want me to. But I had to tell you,\r\nyou dear.... I had to thank you...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn her dark travelling dress and hat, so discreetly conspicuous, so\r\nnegligent and so studied, with a veil masking her paint, and gloves\r\nhiding her rings, she looked younger, simpler, more natural than he had\r\never seen her. Poor Ellie such a good fellow, after all!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo thank me? For what? For being so happy here?\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed, taking her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, laughed back, and flung her arms about his neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor helping me to be so happy elsewhere--you and Susy, you two blessed\r\ndarlings!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, with a kiss on his cheek.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met for a second; then her arms slipped slowly downward,\r\ndropping to her sides. Lansing sat before her like a stone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy do you stare so? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you know...?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey heard Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s shrill voice on the stairs. \xe2\x80\x9cEllie, where the\r\ndeuce are you? Susy\xe2\x80\x99s in the gondola. You\xe2\x80\x99ll miss the train!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLansing stood up and caught Mrs. Vanderlyn by the wrist. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you\r\nmean? What are you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing... But you were both such bricks about the letters.... And\r\nwhen Nelson was here, too.... Nick, don\xe2\x80\x99t hurt my wrist so! I must run!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dropped her hand and stood motionless, staring after her and\r\nlistening to the click of her high heels as she fled across the room and\r\nalong the echoing corridor.\r\n\r\nWhen he turned back to the table he noticed that a small morocco case\r\nhad fallen among his papers. In falling it had opened, and before him,\r\non the pale velvet lining, lay a scarf-pin set with a perfect pearl. He\r\npicked the box up, and was about to hasten after Mrs. Vanderlyn--it\r\nwas so like her to shed jewels on her path!--when he noticed his own\r\ninitials on the cover.\r\n\r\nHe dropped the box as if it had been a hot coal, and sat for a long\r\nwhile gazing at the gold N. L., which seemed to have burnt itself into\r\nhis flesh.\r\n\r\nAt last he roused himself and stood up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH a sigh of relief Susy drew the pins from her hat and threw herself\r\ndown on the lounge.\r\n\r\nThe ordeal she had dreaded was over, and Mr. and Mrs. Vanderlyn had\r\nsafely gone their several ways. Poor Ellie was not noted for prudence,\r\nand when life smiled on her she was given to betraying her gratitude too\r\nopenly; but thanks to Susy\xe2\x80\x99s vigilance (and, no doubt, to Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntacit co-operation), the dreaded twenty-four hours were happily over.\r\nNelson Vanderlyn had departed without a shadow on his brow, and though\r\nEllie\xe2\x80\x99s, when she came down from bidding Nick good-bye, had seemed to\r\nSusy less serene than usual, she became her normal self as soon as it\r\nwas discovered that the red morocco bag with her jewel-box was missing.\r\nBefore it had been discovered in the depths of the gondola they had\r\nreached the station, and there was just time to thrust her into her\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csleeper,\xe2\x80\x9d from which she was seen to wave an unperturbed farewell to\r\nher friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been it through,\xe2\x80\x9d Strefford remarked with a deep\r\nbreath as the St. Moritz express rolled away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d Susy sighed in mute complicity; then, as if to cover her\r\nself-betrayal: \xe2\x80\x9cPoor darling, she does so like what she likes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--even if it\xe2\x80\x99s a rotten bounder,\xe2\x80\x9d Strefford agreed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA rotten bounder? Why, I thought--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat it was still young Davenant? Lord, no--not for the last six\r\nmonths. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t she tell you--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy felt herself redden. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask her--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk her? You mean you didn\xe2\x80\x99t let her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t let her. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t let you,\xe2\x80\x9d Susy added sharply, as he\r\nhelped her into the gondola.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, all right: I daresay you\xe2\x80\x99re right. It simplifies things,\xe2\x80\x9d Strefford\r\nplacidly acquiesced.\r\n\r\nShe made no answer, and in silence they glided homeward.\r\n\r\nNow, in the quiet of her own room, Susy lay and pondered on the distance\r\nshe had travelled during the last year. Strefford had read her mind with\r\nhis usual penetration. It was true that there had been a time when\r\nshe would have thought it perfectly natural that Ellie should tell\r\nher everything; that the name of young Davenant\xe2\x80\x99s successor should be\r\nconfided to her as a matter of course. Apparently even Ellie had been\r\nobscurely aware of the change, for after a first attempt to force her\r\nconfidences on Susy she had contented herself with vague expressions of\r\ngratitude, allusive smiles and sighs, and the pretty \xe2\x80\x9csurprise\xe2\x80\x9d of the\r\nsapphire bangle slipped onto her friend\xe2\x80\x99s wrist in the act of their\r\nfarewell embrace.\r\n\r\nThe bangle was extremely handsome. Susy, who had an auctioneer\xe2\x80\x99s eye\r\nfor values, knew to a fraction the worth of those deep convex stones\r\nalternating with small emeralds and brilliants. She was glad to own the\r\nbracelet, and enchanted with the effect it produced on her slim wrist;\r\nyet, even while admiring it, and rejoicing that it was hers, she had\r\nalready transmuted it into specie, and reckoned just how far it would go\r\ntoward the paying of domestic necessities. For whatever came to her now\r\ninterested her only as something more to be offered up to Nick.\r\n\r\nThe door opened and Nick came in. Dusk had fallen, and she could not\r\nsee his face; but something in the jerk of the door-handle roused her\r\never-wakeful apprehension. She hurried toward him with outstretched\r\nwrist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, dearest--wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it too darling of Ellie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pressed the button of the lamp that lit her dressing-table, and her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s face started unfamiliarly out of the twilight. She slipped off\r\nthe bracelet and held it up to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I can go you one better,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a laugh; and pulling a\r\nmorocco case from his pocket he flung it down among the scent-bottles.\r\n\r\nSusy opened the case automatically, staring at the pearl because she was\r\nafraid to look again at Nick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEllie--gave you this?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked at length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. She gave me this.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cWould you mind telling\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d Lansing continued in the same dead-level tone, \xe2\x80\x9cexactly for what\r\nservices we\xe2\x80\x99ve both been so handsomely paid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pearl is beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d Susy murmured, to gain time, while her head\r\nspun round with unimaginable terrors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo are your sapphires; though, on closer examination, my services would\r\nappear to have been valued rather higher than yours. Would you be kind\r\nenough to tell me just what they were?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy threw her head back and looked at him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth are you\r\ntalking about, Nick! Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t Ellie have given us these things? Do\r\nyou forget that it\xe2\x80\x99s like our giving her a pen-wiper or a button-hook?\r\nWhat is it you are trying to suggest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt had cost her a considerable effort to hold his eyes while she put\r\nthe questions. Something had happened between him and Ellie, that was\r\nevident--one of those hideous unforeseeable blunders that may cause one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncleverest plans to crumble at a stroke; and again Susy shuddered at\r\nthe frailty of her bliss. But her old training stood her in good stead.\r\nThere had been more than one moment in her past when everything--somebody\r\nelse\xe2\x80\x99s everything--had depended on her keeping a cool head and a clear\r\nglance. It would have been a wonder if now, when she felt her own\r\neverything at stake, she had not been able to put up as good a defence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated impatiently, as Lansing continued to remain\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m here to ask,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, keeping his eyes as steady\r\nas she kept hers. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no reason on earth, as you say, why Ellie\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give us presents--as expensive presents as she likes; and the\r\npearl is a beauty. All I ask is: for what specific services were they\r\ngiven? For, allowing for all the absence of scruple that marks the\r\nintercourse of truly civilized people, you\xe2\x80\x99ll probably agree that there\r\nare limits; at least up to now there have been limits....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean. I suppose Ellie wanted to show that\r\nshe was grateful to us for looking after Clarissa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she gave us all this in exchange for that, didn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsuggested, with a sweep of the hand around the beautiful shadowy room.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA whole summer of it if we choose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cApparently she didn\xe2\x80\x99t think that enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a doting mother! It shows the store she sets upon her child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, don\xe2\x80\x99t you set store upon Clarissa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClarissa is exquisite; but her mother didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention her in offering me\r\nthis recompense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy lifted her head again. \xe2\x80\x9cWhom did she mention?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVanderlyn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lansing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVanderlyn? Nelson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--and some letters... something about letters.... What is it, my\r\ndear, that you and I have been hired to hide from Vanderlyn? Because I\r\nshould like to know,\xe2\x80\x9d Nick broke out savagely, \xe2\x80\x9cif we\xe2\x80\x99ve been adequately\r\npaid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy was silent: she needed time to reckon up her forces, and study her\r\nnext move; and her brain was in such a whirl of fear that she could at\r\nlast only retort: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it that Ellie said to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLansing laughed again. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just what you\xe2\x80\x99d like to find out--isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit?--in order to know the line to take in making your explanation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sneer had an effect that he could not have foreseen, and that Susy\r\nherself had not expected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t--don\xe2\x80\x99t let us speak to each other like that!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried; and\r\nsinking down by the dressing-table she hid her face in her hands.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her, now, that nothing mattered except that their love\r\nfor each other, their faith in each other, should be saved from some\r\nunhealable hurt. She was willing to tell Nick everything--she wanted to\r\ntell him everything--if only she could be sure of reaching a responsive\r\nchord in him. But the scene of the cigars came back to her, and benumbed\r\nher. If only she could make him see that nothing was of any account as\r\nlong as they continued to love each other!\r\n\r\nHis touch fell compassionately on her shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor child--don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met, but his expression checked the smile breaking through\r\nher tears. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have this\r\nthing out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe continued to stare at him through a prism of tears. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t--while\r\nyou stand up like that,\xe2\x80\x9d she stammered, childishly.\r\n\r\nShe had cowered down again into a corner of the lounge; but Lansing did\r\nnot seat himself at her side. He took a chair facing her, like a caller\r\non the farther side of a stately tea-tray. \xe2\x80\x9cWill that do?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked with\r\na stiff smile, as if to humour her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing will do--as long as you\xe2\x80\x99re not you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head wearily. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use? You accept things\r\ntheoretically--and then when they happen....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat things? What has happened!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sudden impatience mastered her. What did he suppose, after all--? \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nyou know all about Ellie. We used to talk about her often enough in old\r\ntimes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEllie and young Davenant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung Davenant; or the others....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr the others. But what business was it of ours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that\xe2\x80\x99s just what I think!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, springing up with an\r\nexplosion of relief. Lansing stood up also, but there was no answering\r\nlight in his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re outside of all that; we\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing to do with it, have we?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\npursued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing whatever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what on earth is the meaning of Ellie\xe2\x80\x99s gratitude? Gratitude for\r\nwhat we\xe2\x80\x99ve done about some letters--and about Vanderlyn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, not you,\xe2\x80\x9d Susy cried, involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I? Then you?\xe2\x80\x9d He came close and took her by the wrist. \xe2\x80\x9cAnswer me.\r\nHave you been mixed up in some dirty business of Ellie\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. She found it impossible to speak, with that burning\r\ngrasp on the wrist where the bangle had been. At length he let her go\r\nand moved away. \xe2\x80\x9cAnswer,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve told you it was my business and not yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe received this in silence; then he questioned: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been sending\r\nletters for her, I suppose? To whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, why do you torment me? Nelson was not supposed to know that she\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbeen away. She left me the letters to post to him once a week. I found\r\nthem here the night we arrived.... It was the price--for this. Oh,\r\nNick, say it\xe2\x80\x99s been worth it--say at least that it\xe2\x80\x99s been worth it!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nimplored him.\r\n\r\nHe stood motionless, unresponding. One hand drummed on the corner of her\r\ndressing-table, making the jewelled bangle dance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many letters?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know... four... five... What does it matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd once a week, for six weeks--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you took it all as a matter of course?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo: I hated it. But what could I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat could you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen our being together depended on it? Oh, Nick, how could you think\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d give you up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me up?\xe2\x80\x9d he echoed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--doesn\xe2\x80\x99t our being together depend on--on what we can get out of\r\npeople? And hasn\xe2\x80\x99t there always got to be some give-and-take? Did you\r\never in your life get anything for nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried with sudden\r\nexasperation. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve lived among these people as long as I have; I\r\nsuppose it\xe2\x80\x99s not the first time--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God, but it is,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, flushing. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ndifference--the fundamental difference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe difference!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetween you and me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never in my life done people\xe2\x80\x99s dirty work for\r\nthem--least of all for favours in return. I suppose you guessed it, or\r\nyou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have hidden this beastly business from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe blood rose to Susy\xe2\x80\x99s temples also. Yes, she had guessed it;\r\ninstinctively, from the day she had first visited him in his bare\r\nlodgings, she had been aware of his stricter standard. But how could she\r\ntell him that under his influence her standard had become stricter\r\ntoo, and that it was as much to hide her humiliation from herself as to\r\nescape his anger that she had held her tongue?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou knew I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have stayed here another day if I\xe2\x80\x99d known,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes: and then where in the world should we have gone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that--in one way or another--what you call give-and-take is\r\nthe price of our remaining together?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--isn\xe2\x80\x99t it,\xe2\x80\x9d she faltered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we\xe2\x80\x99d better part, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke in a low tone, thoughtfully and deliberately, as if this had\r\nbeen the inevitable conclusion to which their passionate argument had\r\nled.\r\n\r\nSusy made no answer. For a moment she ceased to be conscious of the\r\ncauses of what had happened; the thing itself seemed to have smothered\r\nher under its ruins.\r\n\r\nNick wandered away from the dressing-table and stood gazing out of the\r\nwindow at the darkening canal flecked with lights. She looked at his\r\nback, and wondered what would happen if she were to go up to him and\r\nfling her arms about him. But even if her touch could have broken the\r\nspell, she was not sure she would have chosen that way of breaking it.\r\nBeneath her speechless anguish there burned the half-conscious sense\r\nof having been unfairly treated. When they had entered into their\r\nqueer compact, Nick had known as well as she on what compromises and\r\nconcessions the life they were to live together must be based. That he\r\nshould have forgotten it seemed so unbelievable that she wondered, with\r\na new leap of fear, if he were using the wretched Ellie\xe2\x80\x99s indiscretion\r\nas a means of escape from a tie already wearied of. Suddenly she raised\r\nher head with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all--you were right when you wanted me to be your mistress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned on her with an astonished stare. \xe2\x80\x9cYou--my mistress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThrough all her pain she thrilled with pride at the discovery that\r\nsuch a possibility had long since become unthinkable to him. But she\r\ninsisted. \xe2\x80\x9cThat day at the Fulmers\xe2\x80\x99--have you forgotten? When you said\r\nit would be sheer madness for us to marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLansing stood leaning in the embrasure of the window, his eyes fixed on\r\nthe mosaic volutes of the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was right enough when I said it would be sheer madness for us to\r\nmarry,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined at length.\r\n\r\nShe sprang up trembling. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s easily settled. Our compact--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that compact--\xe2\x80\x9d he interrupted her with an impatient laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you asking me to carry it out now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I said we\xe2\x80\x99d better part?\xe2\x80\x9d He paused. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the compact--I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nalmost forgotten it--was to the effect, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it, that we were to give\r\neach other a helping hand if either of us had a better chance? The thing\r\nwas absurd, of course; a mere joke; from my point of view, at least. I\r\nshall never want any better chance... any other chance....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Nick, oh, Nick... but then....\xe2\x80\x9d She was close to him, his face\r\nlooming down through her tears; but he put her back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been easy enough, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined, \xe2\x80\x9cif we\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbeen as detachable as all that? As it is, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to hurt horribly.\r\nBut talking it over won\xe2\x80\x99t help. You were right just now when you asked\r\nhow else we were going to live. We\xe2\x80\x99re born parasites, both, I suppose,\r\nor we\xe2\x80\x99d have found out some way long ago. But I find there are things I\r\nmight put up with for myself, at a pinch--and should, probably, in time\r\nthat I can\xe2\x80\x99t let you put up with for me... ever.... Those cigars at\r\nComo: do you suppose I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it was for me? And this too? Well, it\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t do... it won\xe2\x80\x99t do....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped, as if his courage failed him; and she moaned out: \xe2\x80\x9cBut your\r\nwriting--if your book\xe2\x80\x99s a success....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor Susy--that\xe2\x80\x99s all part of the humbug. We both know that my sort\r\nof writing will never pay. And what\xe2\x80\x99s the alternative except more of\r\nthe same kind of baseness? And getting more and more blunted to it? At\r\nleast, till now, I\xe2\x80\x99ve minded certain things; I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go on till\r\nI find myself taking them for granted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe reached out a timid hand. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you needn\xe2\x80\x99t ever, dear... if you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nonly leave it to me....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew back sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cThat seems simple to you, I suppose? Well, men\r\nare different.\xe2\x80\x9d He walked toward the dressing-table and glanced at the\r\nlittle enamelled clock which had been one of her wedding-presents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime to dress, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Shall you mind if I leave you to dine with\r\nStreffy, and whoever else is coming? I\xe2\x80\x99d rather like a long tramp, and\r\nno more talking just at present except with myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe passed her by and walked rapidly out of the room. Susy stood\r\nmotionless, unable to lift a detaining hand or to find a final word\r\nof appeal. On her disordered dressing-table Mrs. Vanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s gifts\r\nglittered in the rosy lamp-light.\r\n\r\nYes: men were different, as he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUT there were necessary accommodations, there always had been; Nick in\r\nold times, had been the first to own it.... How they had laughed at the\r\nPerpendicular People, the people who went by on the other side (since\r\nyou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a good Samaritan without stooping over and poking\r\ninto heaps of you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what)! And now Nick had suddenly become\r\nperpendicular....\r\n\r\nSusy, that evening, at the head of the dinner table, saw--in the breaks\r\nbetween her scudding thoughts--the nauseatingly familiar faces of the\r\npeople she called her friends: Strefford, Fred Gillow, a giggling fool\r\nof a young Breckenridge, of their New York group, who had arrived that\r\nday, and Prince Nerone Altineri, Ursula\xe2\x80\x99s Prince, who, in Ursula\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabsence at a tiresome cure, had, quite simply and naturally, preferred\r\nto join her husband at Venice. Susy looked from one to the other of\r\nthem, as if with newly-opened eyes, and wondered what life would be like\r\nwith no faces but such as theirs to furnish it....\r\n\r\nAh, Nick had become perpendicular!... After all, most people went\r\nthrough life making a given set of gestures, like dance-steps learned\r\nin advance. If your dancing manual told you at a given time to be\r\nperpendicular, you had to be, automatically--and that was Nick!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what on earth, Susy,\xe2\x80\x9d Gillow\xe2\x80\x99s puzzled voice suddenly came to her\r\nas from immeasurable distances, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to do in this beastly\r\nstifling hole for the rest of the summer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk Nick, my dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d Strefford answered for her; and: \xe2\x80\x9cBy the\r\nway, where is Nick--if one may ask?\xe2\x80\x9d young Breckenridge interposed,\r\nglancing up to take belated note of his host\xe2\x80\x99s absence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDining out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susy glibly. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople turned up: blighting bores that\r\nI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have dared to inflict on you.\xe2\x80\x9d How easily the old familiar\r\nfibbing came to her!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe kind to whom you say, \xe2\x80\x98Now mind you look me up\xe2\x80\x99; and then spend the\r\nrest of your life dodging-like our good Hickses,\xe2\x80\x9d Strefford amplified.\r\n\r\nThe Hickses--but, of course, Nick was with the Hickses! It went through\r\nSusy like a knife, and the dinner she had so lightly fibbed became a\r\nhateful truth. She said to herself feverishly: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll call him up there\r\nafter dinner--and then he will feel silly\xe2\x80\x9d--but only to remember that\r\nthe Hickses, in their mediaeval setting, had of course sternly denied\r\nthemselves a telephone.\r\n\r\nThe fact of Nick\xe2\x80\x99s temporary inaccessibility--since she was now\r\nconvinced that he was really at the Hickses\xe2\x80\x99--turned her distress to a\r\nmocking irritation. Ah, that was where he carried his principles, his\r\nstandards, or whatever he called the new set of rules he had suddenly\r\nbegun to apply to the old game! It was stupid of her not to have guessed\r\nit at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the Hickses--Nick adores them, you know. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to marry Coral\r\nnext,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed out, flashing the joke around the table with all her\r\npracticed flippancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord!\xe2\x80\x9d grasped Gillow, inarticulate: while the Prince displayed the\r\nunsurprised smile which Susy accused him of practicing every morning\r\nwith his Mueller exercises.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Susy felt Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s eyes upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with me? Too much rouge?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, passing her arm\r\nin his as they left the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo: too little. Look at yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered in a low tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, in these cadaverous old looking-glasses-everybody looks fished up\r\nfrom the canal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe jerked away from him to spin down the long floor of the sala, hands\r\non hips, whistling a rag-time tune. The Prince and young Breckenridge\r\ncaught her up, and she spun back with the latter, while Gillow--it was\r\nbelieved to be his sole accomplishment--snapped his fingers in simulation\r\nof bones, and shuffled after the couple on stamping feet.\r\n\r\nSusy sank down on a sofa near the window, fanning herself with a\r\nfloating scarf, and the men foraged for cigarettes, and rang for the\r\ngondoliers, who came in with trays of cooling drinks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what next--this ain\xe2\x80\x99t all, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d Gillow presently queried, from\r\nthe divan where he lolled half-asleep with dripping brow. Fred Gillow,\r\nlike Nature, abhorred a void, and it was inconceivable to him that every\r\nhour of man\xe2\x80\x99s rational existence should not furnish a motive for getting\r\nup and going somewhere else. Young Breckenridge, who took the same view,\r\nand the Prince, who earnestly desired to, reminded the company that\r\nsomebody they knew was giving a dance that night at the Lido.\r\n\r\nStrefford vetoed the Lido, on the ground that he\xe2\x80\x99d just come back from\r\nthere, and proposed that they should go out on foot for a change.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? What fun!\xe2\x80\x9d Susy was up in an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s pay somebody a\r\nsurprise visit--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who! Streffy, Prince, can\xe2\x80\x99t you think of\r\nsomebody who\xe2\x80\x99d be particularly annoyed by our arrival?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the list\xe2\x80\x99s too long. Let\xe2\x80\x99s start, and choose our victim on the\r\nway,\xe2\x80\x9d Strefford suggested.\r\n\r\nSusy ran to her room for a light cloak, and without changing her\r\nhigh-heeled satin slippers went out with the four men. There was no\r\nmoon--thank heaven there was no moon!--but the stars hung over them as\r\nclose as fruit, and secret fragrances dropped on them from garden-walls.\r\nSusy\xe2\x80\x99s heart tightened with memories of Como.\r\n\r\nThey wandered on, laughing and dawdling, and yielding to the drifting\r\nwhims of aimless people. Presently someone proposed taking a nearer look\r\nat the facade of San Giorgio Maggiore, and they hailed a gondola and\r\nwere rowed out through the bobbing lanterns and twanging guitar-strings.\r\nWhen they landed again, Gillow, always acutely bored by scenery, and\r\nparticularly resentful of midnight aesthetics, suggested a night club\r\nnear at hand, which was said to be jolly. The Prince warmly supported\r\nthis proposal; but on Susy\xe2\x80\x99s curt refusal they started their rambling\r\nagain, circuitously threading the vague dark lanes and making for the\r\nPiazza and Florian\xe2\x80\x99s ices. Suddenly, at a calle-corner, unfamiliar and\r\nyet somehow known to her, Susy paused to stare about her with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the Hickses--surely that\xe2\x80\x99s their palace? And the windows all lit\r\nup! They must be giving a party! Oh, do let\xe2\x80\x99s go up and surprise them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n The idea struck her as one of the drollest that she had ever originated,\r\nand she wondered that her companions should respond so languidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t see anything very thrilling in surprising the Hickses,\xe2\x80\x9d Gillow\r\nprotested, defrauded of possible excitements; and Strefford added: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwould surprise me more than them if I went.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Susy insisted feverishly: \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It may be awfully\r\nexciting! I have an idea that Coral\xe2\x80\x99s announcing her engagement--her\r\nengagement to Nick! Come, give me a hand, Streff--and you the other,\r\nFred-\xe2\x80\x9d she began to hum the first bars of Donna Anna\xe2\x80\x99s entrance in Don\r\nGiovanni. \xe2\x80\x9cPity I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a black cloak and a mask....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, your face will do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Strefford, laying his hand on her arm.\r\n\r\nShe drew back, flushing crimson. Breckenridge and the Prince had sprung\r\non ahead, and Gillow, lumbering after them, was already halfway up the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy face? My face? What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with my face? Do you know any\r\nreason why I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go to the Hickses to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d Susy broke out in\r\nsudden wrath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone whatever; except that if you do it will bore me to death,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Strefford returned, with serenity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, in that case--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; come on. I hear those fools banging on the door already.\xe2\x80\x9d He caught\r\nher by the hand, and they started up the stairway. But on the first\r\nlanding she paused, twisted her hand out of his, and without a word,\r\nwithout a conscious thought, dashed down the long flight, across the\r\ngreat resounding vestibule and out into the darkness of the calle.\r\n\r\nStrefford caught up with her, and they stood a moment silent in the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSusy--what the devil\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe matter? Can\xe2\x80\x99t you see? That I\xe2\x80\x99m tired, that I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a splitting\r\nheadache--that you bore me to death, one and all of you!\xe2\x80\x9d She turned and\r\nlaid a deprecating hand on his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cStreffy, old dear, don\xe2\x80\x99t mind me:\r\nbut for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake find a gondola and send me home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was never any concern of Streff\xe2\x80\x99s if people wanted to do things he\r\ndid not understand, and she knew that she could count on his obedience.\r\nThey walked on in silence to the next canal, and he picked up a passing\r\ngondola and put her in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow go and amuse yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d she called after him, as the boat shot\r\nunder the nearest bridge. Anything, anything, to be alone, away from the\r\nfolly and futility that would be all she had left if Nick were to drop\r\nout of her life....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut perhaps he has dropped already--dropped for good,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought as\r\nshe set her foot on the Vanderlyn threshold.\r\n\r\nThe short summer night was already growing transparent: a new born\r\nbreeze stirred the soiled surface of the water and sent it lapping\r\nfreshly against the old palace doorways. Nearly two o\xe2\x80\x99clock! Nick had no\r\ndoubt come back long ago. Susy hurried up the stairs, reassured by the\r\nmere thought of his nearness. She knew that when their eyes and their\r\nlips met it would be impossible for anything to keep them apart.\r\n\r\nThe gondolier dozing on the landing roused himself to receive her, and\r\nto proffer two envelopes. The upper one was a telegram for Strefford:\r\nshe threw it down again and paused under the lantern hanging from the\r\npainted vault, the other envelope in her hand. The address it bore was\r\nin Nick\xe2\x80\x99s writing. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen did the signore leave this for me? Has he gone\r\nout again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGone out again? But the signore had not come in since dinner: of that\r\nthe gondolier was positive, as he had been on duty all the evening.\r\nA boy had brought the letter--an unknown boy: he had left it without\r\nwaiting. It must have been about half an hour after the signora had\r\nherself gone out with her guests.\r\n\r\nSusy, hardly hearing him, fled on to her own room, and there, beside the\r\nvery lamp which, two months before, had illuminated Ellie Vanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfatal letter, she opened Nick\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think me hard on you, dear; but I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to work this thing out\r\nby myself. The sooner the better--don\xe2\x80\x99t you agree? So I\xe2\x80\x99m taking the\r\nexpress to Milan presently. You\xe2\x80\x99ll get a proper letter in a day or two.\r\nI wish I could think, now, of something to say that would show you I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nnot a brute--but I can\xe2\x80\x99t. N. L.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was not much of the night left in which to sleep, even had a\r\nsemblance of sleep been achievable. The letter fell from Susy\xe2\x80\x99s hands,\r\nand she crept out onto the balcony and cowered there, her forehead\r\npressed against the balustrade, the dawn wind stirring in her thin\r\nlaces. Through her closed eyelids and the tightly-clenched fingers\r\npressed against them, she felt the penetration of the growing light,\r\nthe relentless advance of another day--a day without purpose and without\r\nmeaning--a day without Nick. At length she dropped her hands, and\r\nstaring from dry lids saw a rim of fire above the roofs across the Grand\r\nCanal. She sprang up, ran back into her room, and dragging the heavy\r\ncurtains shut across the windows, stumbled over in the darkness to the\r\nlounge and fell among its pillows-face downward--groping, delving for a\r\ndeeper night....\r\n\r\nShe started up, stiff and aching, to see a golden wedge of sun on the\r\nfloor at her feet. She had slept, then--was it possible?--it must\r\nbe eight or nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock already! She had slept--slept like a\r\ndrunkard--with that letter on the table at her elbow! Ah, now she\r\nremembered--she had dreamed that the letter was a dream! But there,\r\ninexorably, it lay; and she picked it up, and slowly, painfully re-read\r\nit. Then she tore it into shreds hunted for a match, and kneeling before\r\nthe empty hearth, as though she were accomplishing some funeral rite,\r\nshe burnt every shred of it to ashes. Nick would thank her for that some\r\nday!\r\n\r\nAfter a bath and a hurried toilet she began to be aware of feeling\r\nyounger and more hopeful. After all, Nick had merely said that he was\r\ngoing away for \xe2\x80\x9ca day or two.\xe2\x80\x9d And the letter was not cruel: there\r\nwere tender things in it, showing through the curt words. She smiled\r\nat herself a little stiffly in the glass, put a dash of red on her\r\ncolourless lips, and rang for the maid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCoffee, Giovanna, please; and will you tell Mr. Strefford that I should\r\nlike to see him presently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Nick really kept to his intention of staying away for a few days she\r\nmust trump up some explanation of his absence; but her mind refused to\r\nwork, and the only thing she could think of was to take Strefford into\r\nher confidence. She knew that he could be trusted in a real difficulty;\r\nhis impish malice transformed itself into a resourceful ingenuity when\r\nhis friends required it.\r\n\r\nThe maid stood looking at her with a puzzled gaze, and Susy somewhat\r\nsharply repeated her order. \xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t wake him on purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\r\nforeseeing the probable effect on Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s temper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, signora, the gentleman is already out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlready out?\xe2\x80\x9d Strefford, who could hardly be routed from his bed before\r\nluncheon-time! \xe2\x80\x9cIs it so late?\xe2\x80\x9d Susy cried, incredulous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter nine. And the gentleman took the eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock train for England.\r\nGervaso said he had received a telegram. He left word that he would\r\nwrite to the signora.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door closed upon the maid, and Susy continued to gaze at her painted\r\nimage in the glass, as if she had been trying to outstare an importunate\r\nstranger. There was no one left for her to take counsel of, then--no one\r\nbut poor Fred Gillow! She made a grimace at the idea.\r\n\r\nBut what on earth could have summoned Strefford back to England?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNICK LANSING, in the Milan express, was roused by the same bar of\r\nsunshine lying across his knees. He yawned, looked with disgust at his\r\nstolidly sleeping neighbours, and wondered why he had decided to go to\r\nMilan, and what on earth he should do when he got there. The difficulty\r\nabout trenchant decisions was that the next morning they generally left\r\none facing a void....\r\n\r\nWhen the train drew into the station at Milan, he scrambled out, got\r\nsome coffee, and having drunk it decided to continue his journey to\r\nGenoa. The state of being carried passively onward postponed action and\r\ndulled thought; and after twelve hours of furious mental activity that\r\nwas exactly what he wanted.\r\n\r\nHe fell into a doze again, waking now and then to haggard intervals\r\nof more thinking, and then dropping off to the clank and rattle of the\r\ntrain. Inside his head, in his waking intervals, the same clanking and\r\ngrinding of wheels and chains went on unremittingly. He had done all his\r\nlucid thinking within an hour of leaving the Palazzo Vanderlyn the\r\nnight before; since then, his brain had simply continued to revolve\r\nindefatigably about the same old problem. His cup of coffee, instead of\r\nclearing his thoughts, had merely accelerated their pace.\r\n\r\nAt Genoa he wandered about in the hot streets, bought a cheap suit-case\r\nand some underclothes, and then went down to the port in search of a\r\nlittle hotel he remembered there. An hour later he was sitting in the\r\ncoffee-room, smoking and glancing vacantly over the papers while he\r\nwaited for dinner, when he became aware of being timidly but intently\r\nexamined by a small round-faced gentleman with eyeglasses who sat alone\r\nat the adjoining table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo--Buttles!\xe2\x80\x9d Lansing exclaimed, recognising with surprise the\r\nrecalcitrant secretary who had resisted Miss Hicks\xe2\x80\x99s endeavour to\r\nconvert him to Tiepolo.\r\n\r\nMr. Buttles, blushing to the roots of his scant hair, half rose and\r\nbowed ceremoniously.\r\n\r\nNick Lansing\xe2\x80\x99s first feeling was of annoyance at being disturbed in his\r\nsolitary broodings; his next, of relief at having to postpone them even\r\nto converse with Mr. Buttles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo idea you were here: is the yacht in harbour?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, remembering\r\nthat the Ibis must be just about to spread her wings.\r\n\r\nMr. Buttles, at salute behind his chair, signed a mute negation: for the\r\nmoment he seemed too embarrassed to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh--you\xe2\x80\x99re here as an advance guard? I remember now--I saw Miss Hicks\r\nin Venice the day before yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d Lansing continued, dazed at the\r\nthought that hardly forty-eight hours had passed since his encounter\r\nwith Coral in the Scalzi.\r\n\r\nMr. Buttles, instead of speaking, had tentatively approached his table.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I take this seat for a moment, Mr. Lansing? Thank you. No, I am\r\nnot here as an advance guard--though I believe the Ibis is due some\r\ntime to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d He cleared his throat, wiped his eyeglasses on a silk\r\nhandkerchief, replaced them on his nose, and went on solemnly: \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\r\nto clear up any possible misunderstanding, I ought to say that I am no\r\nlonger in the employ of Mr. Hicks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLansing glanced at him sympathetically. It was clear that he suffered\r\nhorribly in imparting this information, though his compact face did not\r\nlend itself to any dramatic display of emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally,\xe2\x80\x9d Nick smiled, and then ventured: \xe2\x80\x9cI hope it\xe2\x80\x99s not owing to\r\nconscientious objections to Tiepolo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Buttles\xe2\x80\x99s blush became a smouldering agony. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Miss Hicks\r\nmentioned to you... told you...? No, Mr. Lansing. I am principled\r\nagainst the effete art of Tiepolo, and of all his contemporaries, I\r\nconfess; but if Miss Hicks chooses to surrender herself momentarily\r\nto the unwholesome spell of the Italian decadence it is not for me to\r\nprotest or to criticize. Her intellectual and aesthetic range so far\r\nexceeds my humble capacity that it would be ridiculous, unbecoming....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe broke off, and once more wiped a faint moisture from his eyeglasses.\r\nIt was evident that he was suffering from a distress which he longed and\r\nyet dreaded to communicate. But Nick made no farther effort to bridge\r\nthe gulf of his own preoccupations; and Mr. Buttles, after an expectant\r\npause, went on: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you see me here to-day it is only because, after\r\na somewhat abrupt departure, I find myself unable to take leave of\r\nour friends without a last look at the Ibis--the scene of so many\r\nstimulating hours. But I must beg you,\xe2\x80\x9d he added earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cshould you\r\nsee Miss Hicks--or any other member of the party--to make no allusion\r\nto my presence in Genoa. I wish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Buttles with simplicity, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\npreserve the strictest incognito.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLansing glanced at him kindly. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, but--isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a little\r\nunfriendly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo other course is possible, Mr. Lansing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the ex-secretary, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nI commit myself to your discretion. The truth is, if I am here it is not\r\nto look once more at the Ibis, but at Miss Hicks: once only. You will\r\nunderstand me, and appreciate what I am suffering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bowed again, and trotted away on his small, tightly-booted feet;\r\npausing on the threshold to say: \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the first it was hopeless,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n before he disappeared through the glass doors.\r\n\r\nA gleam of commiseration flashed through Nick\xe2\x80\x99s mind: there was\r\nsomething quaintly poignant in the sight of the brisk and efficient\r\nMr. Buttles reduced to a limp image of unrequited passion. And what\r\na painful surprise to the Hickses to be thus suddenly deprived of the\r\nsecretary who possessed \xe2\x80\x9cthe foreign languages\xe2\x80\x9d! Mr. Beck kept the\r\naccounts and settled with the hotel-keepers; but it was Mr. Buttles\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nloftier task to entertain in their own tongues the unknown geniuses who\r\nflocked about the Hickses, and Nick could imagine how disconcerting his\r\ndeparture must be on the eve of their Grecian cruise which Mrs. Hicks\r\nwould certainly call an Odyssey.\r\n\r\nThe next moment the vision of Coral\xe2\x80\x99s hopeless suitor had faded, and\r\nNick was once more spinning around on the wheel of his own woes.\r\nThe night before, when he had sent his note to Susy, from a little\r\nrestaurant close to Palazzo Vanderlyn that they often patronized, he had\r\ndone so with the firm intention of going away for a day or two in order\r\nto collect his wits and think over the situation. But after his letter\r\nhad been entrusted to the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s little son, who was a particular\r\nfriend of Susy\xe2\x80\x99s, Nick had decided to await the lad\xe2\x80\x99s return. The\r\nmessenger had not been bidden to ask for an answer; but Nick, knowing\r\nthe friendly and inquisitive Italian mind, was almost sure that the boy,\r\nin the hope of catching a glimpse of Susy, would linger about while the\r\nletter was carried up. And he pictured the maid knocking at his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndarkened room, and Susy dashing some powder on her tear-stained face\r\nbefore she turned on the light--poor foolish child!\r\n\r\nThe boy had returned rather sooner than Nick expected, and he had\r\nbrought no answer, but merely the statement that the signora was out:\r\nthat everybody was out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe signora and the four gentlemen who were dining at the palace. They\r\nall went out together on foot soon after dinner. There was no one to\r\nwhom I could give the note but the gondolier on the landing, for the\r\nsignora had said she would be very late, and had sent the maid to bed;\r\nand the maid had, of course, gone out immediately with her innamorato.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh--\xe2\x80\x9d said Nick, slipping his reward into the boy\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and walking\r\nout of the restaurant.\r\n\r\nSusy had gone out--gone out with their usual band, as she did every\r\nnight in these sultry summer weeks, gone out after her talk with Nick,\r\nas if nothing had happened, as if his whole world and hers had not\r\ncrashed in ruins at their feet. Ah, poor Susy! After all, she had merely\r\nobeyed the instinct of self preservation, the old hard habit of keeping\r\nup, going ahead and hiding her troubles; unless indeed the habit had\r\nalready engendered indifference, and it had become as easy for her as\r\nfor most of her friends to pass from drama to dancing, from sorrow to\r\nthe cinema. What of soul was left, he wondered--?\r\n\r\nHis train did not start till midnight, and after leaving the restaurant\r\nNick tramped the sultry by-ways till his tired legs brought him to a\r\nstandstill under the vine-covered pergola of a gondolier\xe2\x80\x99s wine-shop at\r\na landing close to the Piazzetta. There he could absorb cooling drinks\r\nuntil it was time to go to the station.\r\n\r\nIt was after eleven, and he was beginning to look about for a boat, when\r\na black prow pushed up to the steps, and with much chaff and laughter a\r\nparty of young people in evening dress jumped out. Nick, from under the\r\ndarkness of the vine, saw that there was only one lady among them, and\r\nit did not need the lamp above the landing to reveal her identity. Susy,\r\nbareheaded and laughing, a light scarf slipping from her bare shoulders,\r\na cigarette between her fingers, took Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s arm and turned in the\r\ndirection of Florian\xe2\x80\x99s, with Gillow, the Prince and young Breckenridge\r\nin her wake....\r\n\r\nNick had relived this rapid scene hundreds of times during his hours\r\nin the train and his aimless trampings through the streets of Genoa. In\r\nthat squirrel-wheel of a world of his and Susy\xe2\x80\x99s you had to keep going\r\nor drop out--and Susy, it was evident, had chosen to keep going. Under\r\nthe lamp-flare on the landing he had had a good look at her face, and\r\nhad seen that the mask of paint and powder was carefully enough adjusted\r\nto hide any ravages the scene between them might have left. He even\r\nfancied that she had dropped a little atropine into her eyes....\r\n\r\nThere was no time to spare if he meant to catch the midnight train, and\r\nno gondola in sight but that which his wife had just left. He sprang\r\ninto it, and bade the gondolier carry him to the station. The cushions,\r\nas he leaned back, gave out a breath of her scent; and in the glare of\r\nelectric light at the station he saw at his feet a rose which had fallen\r\nfrom her dress. He ground his heel into it as he got out.\r\n\r\nThere it was, then; that was the last picture he was to have of her. For\r\nhe knew now that he was not going back; at least not to take up their\r\nlife together. He supposed he should have to see her once, to talk\r\nthings over, settle something for their future. He had been sincere in\r\nsaying that he bore her no ill-will; only he could never go back into\r\nthat slough again. If he did, he knew he would inevitably be drawn\r\nunder, slipping downward from concession to concession....\r\n\r\nThe noises of a hot summer night in the port of Genoa would have kept\r\nthe most care-free from slumber; but though Nick lay awake he did\r\nnot notice them, for the tumult in his brain was more deafening. Dawn\r\nbrought a negative relief, and out of sheer weariness he dropped into a\r\nheavy sleep. When he woke it was nearly noon, and from his window he saw\r\nthe well-known outline of the Ibis standing up dark against the glitter\r\nof the harbour. He had no fear of meeting her owners, who had doubtless\r\nlong since landed and betaken themselves to cooler and more fashionable\r\nregions: oddly enough, the fact seemed to accentuate his loneliness, his\r\nsense of having no one on earth to turn to. He dressed, and wandered out\r\ndisconsolately to pick up a cup of coffee in some shady corner.\r\n\r\nAs he drank his coffee his thoughts gradually cleared. It became\r\nobvious to him that he had behaved like a madman or a petulant child--he\r\npreferred to think it was like a madman. If he and Susy were to separate\r\nthere was no reason why it should not be done decently and quietly, as\r\nsuch transactions were habitually managed among people of their kind.\r\nIt seemed grotesque to introduce melodrama into their little world\r\nof unruffled Sybarites, and he felt inclined, now, to smile at the\r\nincongruity of his gesture.... But suddenly his eyes filled with tears.\r\nThe future without Susy was unbearable, inconceivable. Why, after all,\r\nshould they separate? At the question, her soft face seemed close\r\nto his, and that slight lift of the upper lip that made her smile so\r\nexquisite. Well--he would go back. But not with any presence of going to\r\ntalk things over, come to an agreement, wind up their joint life like\r\na business association. No--if he went back he would go without\r\nconditions, for good, forever....\r\n\r\nOnly, what about the future? What about the not far-distant day when\r\nthe wedding cheques would have been spent, and Granny\xe2\x80\x99s pearls sold,\r\nand nothing left except unconcealed and unconditional dependence on rich\r\nfriends, the role of the acknowledged hangers-on? Was there no other\r\npossible solution, no new way of ordering their lives? No--there\r\nwas none: he could not picture Susy out of her setting of luxury and\r\nleisure, could not picture either of them living such a life as the Nat\r\nFulmers, for instance! He remembered the shabby untidy bungalow in\r\nNew Hampshire, the slatternly servants, uneatable food and ubiquitous\r\nchildren. How could he ask Susy to share such a life with him? If he\r\ndid, she would probably have the sense to refuse. Their alliance had\r\nbeen based on a moment\xe2\x80\x99s midsummer madness; now the score must be\r\npaid....\r\n\r\nHe decided to write. If they were to part he could not trust himself to\r\nsee her. He called a waiter, asked for pen and paper, and pushed aside\r\na pile of unread newspapers on the corner of the table where his coffee\r\nhad been served. As he did so, his eye lit on a Daily Mail of two days\r\nbefore. As a pretext for postponing his letter, he took up the paper and\r\nglanced down the first page. He read:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTragic Yachting Accident in the Solent. The Earl of Altringham and\r\nhis son Viscount d\xe2\x80\x99Amblay drowned in midnight collision. Both bodies\r\nrecovered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe read on. He grasped the fact that the disaster had happened the\r\nnight before he had left Venice and that, as the result of a fog in\r\nthe Solent, their old friend Strefford was now Earl of Altringham, and\r\npossessor of one of the largest private fortunes in England. It was\r\nvertiginous to think of their old impecunious Streff as the hero of such\r\nan adventure. And what irony in that double turn of the wheel which, in\r\none day, had plunged him, Nick Lansing, into nethermost misery, while it\r\ntossed the other to the stars!\r\n\r\nWith an intenser precision he saw again Susy\xe2\x80\x99s descent from the gondola\r\nat the calle steps, the sound of her laughter and of Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s chaff,\r\nthe way she had caught his arm and clung to it, sweeping the other men\r\non in her train. Strefford--Susy and Strefford!... More than once, Nick\r\nhad noticed the softer inflections of his friend\xe2\x80\x99s voice when he spoke\r\nto Susy, the brooding look in his lazy eyes when they rested on her. In\r\nthe security of his wedded bliss Nick had made light of those signs. The\r\nonly real jealousy he had felt had been of Fred Gillow, because of his\r\nunlimited power to satisfy a woman\xe2\x80\x99s whims. Yet Nick knew that such\r\nmaterial advantages would never again suffice for Susy. With Strefford\r\nit was different. She had delighted in his society while he was\r\nnotoriously ineligible; might not she find him irresistible now?\r\n\r\nThe forgotten terms of their bridal compact came back to Nick: the\r\nabsurd agreement on which he and Susy had solemnly pledged their faith.\r\nBut was it so absurd, after all? It had been Susy\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion (not his,\r\nthank God!); and perhaps in making it she had been more serious than he\r\nimagined. Perhaps, even if their rupture had not occurred, Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsudden honours might have caused her to ask for her freedom....\r\n\r\nMoney, luxury, fashion, pleasure: those were the four cornerstones\r\nof her existence. He had always known it--she herself had always\r\nacknowledged it, even in their last dreadful talk together; and once he\r\nhad gloried in her frankness. How could he ever have imagined that, to\r\nhave her fill of these things, she would not in time stoop lower than\r\nshe had yet stooped? Perhaps in giving her up to Strefford he might be\r\nsaving her. At any rate, the taste of the past was now so bitter to him\r\nthat he was moved to thank whatever gods there were for pushing that\r\nmortuary paragraph under his eye....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSusy, dear [he wrote], the fates seem to have taken our future in hand,\r\nand spared us the trouble of unravelling it. If I have sometimes been\r\nselfish enough to forget the conditions on which you agreed to marry\r\nme, they have come back to me during these two days of solitude. You\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngiven me the best a man can have, and nothing else will ever be worth\r\nmuch to me. But since I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the ability to provide you with what you\r\nwant, I recognize that I\xe2\x80\x99ve no right to stand in your way. We must owe\r\nno more Venetian palaces to underhand services. I see by the newspapers\r\nthat Streff can now give you as many palaces as you want. Let him have\r\nthe chance--I fancy he\xe2\x80\x99ll jump at it, and he\xe2\x80\x99s the best man in sight. I\r\nwish I were in his shoes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll write again in a day or two, when I\xe2\x80\x99ve collected my wits, and can\r\ngive you an address. NICK.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe added a line on the subject of their modest funds, put the letter\r\ninto an envelope, and addressed it to Mrs. Nicholas Lansing. As he did\r\nso, he reflected that it was the first time he had ever written his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s married name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--by God, no other woman shall have it after her,\xe2\x80\x9d he vowed, as he\r\ngroped in his pocketbook for a stamp.\r\n\r\nHe stood up with a stretch of weariness--the heat was stifling!--and put\r\nthe letter in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll post it myself, it\xe2\x80\x99s safer,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought; \xe2\x80\x9cand then what in the\r\nname of goodness shall I do next, I wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d He jammed his hat down on\r\nhis head and walked out into the sun-blaze.\r\n\r\nAs he was turning away from the square by the general Post Office, a\r\nwhite parasol waved from a passing cab, and Coral Hicks leaned forward\r\nwith outstretched hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew I\xe2\x80\x99d find you,\xe2\x80\x9d she triumphed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen driving up and down in this broiling sun for hours, shopping and\r\nwatching for you at the same time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stared at her blankly, too bewildered even to wonder how she knew he\r\nwas in Genoa; and she continued, with the kind of shy imperiousness that\r\nalways made him feel, in her presence, like a member of an orchestra\r\nunder a masterful baton; \xe2\x80\x9cNow please get right into this carriage, and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t keep me roasting here another minute.\xe2\x80\x9d To the cabdriver she called\r\nout: \xe2\x80\x9cAl porto.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNick Lansing sank down beside her. As he did so he noticed a heap of\r\nbundles at her feet, and felt that he had simply added one more to the\r\nnumber. He supposed that she was taking her spoils to the Ibis, and\r\nthat he would be carried up to the deck-house to be displayed with the\r\nothers. Well, it would all help to pass the day--and by night he would\r\nhave reached some kind of a decision about his future.\r\n\r\nOn the third day after Nick\xe2\x80\x99s departure the post brought to the Palazzo\r\nVanderlyn three letters for Mrs. Lansing.\r\n\r\nThe first to arrive was a word from Strefford, scribbled in the train\r\nand posted at Turin. In it he briefly said that he had been called home\r\nby the dreadful accident of which Susy had probably read in the daily\r\npapers. He added that he would write again from England, and then--in\r\na blotted postscript--: \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted uncommonly badly to see you for\r\ngood-bye, but the hour was impossible. Regards to Nick. Do write me just\r\na word to Altringham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other two letters, which came together in the afternoon, were both\r\nfrom Genoa. Susy scanned the addresses and fell upon the one in her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s writing. Her hand trembled so much that for a moment she could\r\nnot open the envelope. When she had done so, she devoured the letter in\r\na flash, and then sat and brooded over the outspread page as it lay on\r\nher knee. It might mean so many things--she could read into it so\r\nmany harrowing alternatives of indifference and despair, of irony and\r\ntenderness! Was he suffering tortures when he wrote it, or seeking\r\nonly to inflict them upon her? Or did the words represent his actual\r\nfeelings, no more and no less, and did he really intend her to\r\nunderstand that he considered it his duty to abide by the letter of\r\ntheir preposterous compact? He had left her in wrath and indignation,\r\nyet, as a closer scrutiny revealed, there was not a word of reproach in\r\nhis brief lines. Perhaps that was why, in the last issue, they seemed so\r\ncold to her.... She shivered and turned to the other envelope.\r\n\r\nThe large stilted characters, though half-familiar, called up no\r\ndefinite image. She opened the envelope and discovered a post-card of\r\nthe Ibis, canvas spread, bounding over a rippled sea. On the back was\r\nwritten:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo awfully dear of you to lend us Mr. Lansing for a little cruise. You\r\nmay count on our taking the best of care of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCORAL\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nWHEN Violet Melrose had said to Susy Branch, the winter before in New\r\nYork: \xe2\x80\x9cBut why on earth don\xe2\x80\x99t you and Nick go to my little place at\r\nVersailles for the honeymoon? I\xe2\x80\x99m off to China, and you could have it to\r\nyourselves all summer,\xe2\x80\x9d the offer had been tempting enough to make the\r\nlovers waver.\r\n\r\nIt was such an artless ingenuous little house, so full of the\r\ndemoralizing simplicity of great wealth, that it seemed to Susy just the\r\nkind of place in which to take the first steps in renunciation. But Nick\r\nhad objected that Paris, at that time of year, would be swarming with\r\nacquaintances who would hunt them down at all hours; and Susy\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nexperience had led her to remark that there was nothing the very rich\r\nenjoyed more than taking pot-luck with the very poor. They therefore\r\ngave Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s villa the preference, with an inward proviso (on Susy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npart) that Violet\xe2\x80\x99s house might very conveniently serve their purpose at\r\nanother season.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts were in her mind as she drove up to Mrs. Melrose\xe2\x80\x99s door\r\non a rainy afternoon late in August, her boxes piled high on the roof of\r\nthe cab she had taken at the station. She had travelled straight through\r\nfrom Venice, stopping in Milan just long enough to pick up a reply\r\nto the telegram she had despatched to the perfect housekeeper whose\r\npermanent presence enabled Mrs. Melrose to say: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, when I\xe2\x80\x99m sick\r\nof everything I just rush off without warning to my little shanty at\r\nVersailles, and live there all alone on scrambled eggs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe perfect house-keeper had replied to Susy\xe2\x80\x99s enquiry: \xe2\x80\x9cAm sure Mrs.\r\nMelrose most happy\xe2\x80\x9d; and Susy, without further thought, had jumped\r\ninto a Versailles train, and now stood in the thin rain before the\r\nsphinx-guarded threshold of the pavilion.\r\n\r\nThe revolving year had brought around the season at which Mrs. Melrose\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse might be convenient: no visitors were to be feared at Versailles\r\nat the end of August, and though Susy\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for seeking solitude\r\nwere so remote from those she had once prefigured, they were none the\r\nless cogent. To be alone--alone! After those first exposed days when,\r\nin the persistent presence of Fred Gillow and his satellites, and in the\r\nmocking radiance of late summer on the lagoons, she had fumed and turned\r\nabout in her agony like a trapped animal in a cramping cage, to be alone\r\nhad seemed the only respite, the one craving: to be alone somewhere in a\r\nsetting as unlike as possible to the sensual splendours of Venice, under\r\nskies as unlike its azure roof. If she could have chosen she would have\r\ncrawled away into a dingy inn in a rainy northern town, where she had\r\nnever been and no one knew her. Failing that unobtainable luxury, here\r\nshe was on the threshold of an empty house, in a deserted place, under\r\nlowering skies. She had shaken off Fred Gillow, sulkily departing for\r\nhis moor (where she had half-promised to join him in September); the\r\nPrince, young Breckenridge, and the few remaining survivors of the\r\nVenetian group, had dispersed in the direction of the Engadine or\r\nBiarritz; and now she could at least collect her wits, take stock of\r\nherself, and prepare the countenance with which she was to face the next\r\nstage in her career. Thank God it was raining at Versailles!\r\n\r\nThe door opened, she heard voices in the drawing-room, and a slender\r\nlanguishing figure appeared on the threshold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDarling!\xe2\x80\x9d Violet Melrose cried in an embrace, drawing her into the\r\ndusky perfumed room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought you were in China!\xe2\x80\x9d Susy stammered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn China... in China,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Melrose stared with dreamy eyes, and Susy\r\nremembered her drifting disorganised life, a life more planless, more\r\ninexplicable than that of any of the other ephemeral beings blown about\r\nupon the same winds of pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Madam, I thought so myself till I got a wire from Mrs. Melrose\r\nlast evening,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the perfect house-keeper, following with Susy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhandbag.\r\n\r\nMrs. Melrose clutched her cavernous temples in her attenuated hands. \xe2\x80\x9cOf\r\ncourse, of course! I had meant to go to China--no, India.... But I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ndiscovered a genius... and Genius, you know....\xe2\x80\x9d Unable to complete\r\nher thought, she sank down upon a pillowy divan, stretched out an arm,\r\ncried: \xe2\x80\x9cFulmer! Fulmer!\xe2\x80\x9d and, while Susy Lansing stood in the middle\r\nof the room with widening eyes, a man emerged from the more deeply\r\ncushioned and scented twilight of some inner apartment, and she saw with\r\nsurprise Nat Fulmer, the good Nat Fulmer of the New Hampshire bungalow\r\nand the ubiquitous progeny, standing before her in lordly ease, his\r\nhands in his pockets, a cigarette between his lips, his feet solidly\r\nplanted in the insidious depths of one of Violet Melrose\xe2\x80\x99s white leopard\r\nskins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSusy!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted with open arms; and Mrs. Melrose murmured: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know, then? You hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard of his masterpieces?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of herself, Susy burst into a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cIs Nat your genius?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Melrose looked at her reproachfully.\r\n\r\nFulmer laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cNo; I\xe2\x80\x99m Grace\xe2\x80\x99s. But Mrs. Melrose has been our\r\nProvidence, and....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProvidence?\xe2\x80\x9d his hostess interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk as if you were at\r\na prayer-meeting! He had an exhibition in New York... it was the most\r\nfabulous success. He\xe2\x80\x99s come abroad to make studies for the decoration of\r\nmy music-room in New York. Ursula Gillow has given him her garden-house\r\nat Roslyn to do. And Mrs. Bockheimer\xe2\x80\x99s ball-room--oh, Fulmer, where are\r\nthe cartoons?\xe2\x80\x9d She sprang up, tossed about some fashion-papers heaped on\r\na lacquer table, and sank back exhausted by the effort. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d got as far\r\nas Brindisi. I\xe2\x80\x99ve travelled day and night to be here to meet him,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ndeclared. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, you darling,\xe2\x80\x9d and she held out a caressing hand to Susy,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m forgetting to ask if you\xe2\x80\x99ve had tea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn hour later, over the tea-table, Susy already felt herself\r\nmysteriously reabsorbed into what had so long been her native element.\r\nEllie Vanderlyn had brought a breath of it to Venice; but Susy was then\r\nnourished on another air, the air of Nick\xe2\x80\x99s presence and personality;\r\nnow that she was abandoned, left again to her own devices, she felt\r\nherself suddenly at the mercy of the influences from which she thought\r\nshe had escaped.\r\n\r\nIn the queer social whirligig from which she had so lately fled, it\r\nseemed natural enough that a shake of the box should have tossed Nat\r\nFulmer into celebrity, and sent Violet Melrose chasing back from the\r\nends of the earth to bask in his success. Susy knew that Mrs. Melrose\r\nbelonged to the class of moral parasites; for in that strange world the\r\nparts were sometimes reversed, and the wealthy preyed upon the pauper.\r\nWherever there was a reputation to batten on, there poor Violet\r\nappeared, a harmless vampire in pearls who sought only to feed on the\r\nnotoriety which all her millions could not create for her. Any one less\r\nversed than Susy in the shallow mysteries of her little world would have\r\nseen in Violet Melrose a baleful enchantress, in Nat Fulmer her helpless\r\nvictim. Susy knew better. Violet, poor Violet, was not even that. The\r\ninsignificant Ellie Vanderlyn, with her brief trivial passions, her\r\nartless mixture of amorous and social interests, was a woman with\r\na purpose, a creature who fulfilled herself; but Violet was only a\r\ndrifting interrogation.\r\n\r\nAnd what of Fulmer? Mustering with new eyes his short sturdily-built\r\nfigure, his nondescript bearded face, and the eyes that dreamed and\r\nwandered, and then suddenly sank into you like claws, Susy seemed to\r\nhave found the key to all his years of dogged toil, his indifference\r\nto neglect, indifference to poverty, indifference to the needs of\r\nhis growing family.... Yes: for the first time she saw that he looked\r\ncommonplace enough to be a genius--was a genius, perhaps, even though\r\nit was Violet Melrose who affirmed it! Susy looked steadily at Fulmer,\r\ntheir eyes met, and he smiled at her faintly through his beard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I did discover him--I did,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Melrose was insisting, from the\r\ndepths of the black velvet divan in which she lay sunk like a wan Nereid\r\nin a midnight sea. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t believe a word that Ursula Gillow tells\r\nyou about having pounced on his \xe2\x80\x98Spring Snow Storm\xe2\x80\x99 in a dark corner of\r\nthe American Artists\xe2\x80\x99 exhibition--skied, if you please! They skied him\r\nless than a year ago! And naturally Ursula never in her life looked\r\nhigher than the first line at a picture-show. And now she actually\r\npretends... oh, for pity\xe2\x80\x99s sake don\xe2\x80\x99t say it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, Fulmer!\r\nYour saying that just encourages her, and makes people think she\r\ndid. When, in reality, any one who saw me at the exhibition on\r\nvarnishing-day.... Who? Well, Eddy Breckenridge, for instance. He was\r\nin Egypt, you say? Perhaps he was! As if one could remember the people\r\nabout one, when suddenly one comes upon a great work of art, as St.\r\nPaul did--didn\xe2\x80\x99t he?--and the scales fell from his eyes. Well... that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexactly what happened to me that day... and Ursula, everybody knows, was\r\ndown at Roslyn at the time, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t come up for the opening of the\r\nexhibition at all. And Fulmer sits there and laughs, and says it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, and that he\xe2\x80\x99ll paint another picture any day for me to\r\ndiscover!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy had rung the door-bell with a hand trembling with\r\neagerness--eagerness to be alone, to be quiet, to stare her situation in\r\nthe face, and collect herself before she came out again among her kind.\r\nShe had stood on the door-step, cowering among her bags, counting the\r\ninstants till a step sounded and the door-knob turned, letting her in\r\nfrom the searching glare of the outer world.... And now she had sat for\r\nan hour in Violet\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room, in the very house where her honey-moon\r\nmight have been spent; and no one had asked her where she had come from,\r\nor why she was alone, or what was the key to the tragedy written on her\r\nshrinking face....\r\n\r\nThat was the way of the world they lived in. Nobody questioned, nobody\r\nwondered any more--because nobody had time to remember. The old risk of\r\nprying curiosity, of malicious gossip, was virtually over: one was left\r\nwith one\xe2\x80\x99s drama, one\xe2\x80\x99s disaster, on one\xe2\x80\x99s hands, because there was\r\nnobody to stop and notice the little shrouded object one was carrying.\r\nAs Susy watched the two people before her, each so frankly unaffected\r\nby her presence, Violet Melrose so engrossed in her feverish pursuit of\r\nnotoriety, Fulmer so plunged in the golden sea of his success, she felt\r\nlike a ghost making inaudible and imperceptible appeals to the grosser\r\nsenses of the living.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I wanted to be alone,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m alone enough, in all\r\nconscience.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a deathly chill in such security. She turned to\r\nFulmer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Grace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe beamed back without sign of embarrassment. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, she\xe2\x80\x99s here,\r\nnaturally--we\xe2\x80\x99re in Paris, kids and all. In a pension, where we can\r\npolish up the lingo. But I hardly ever lay eyes on her, because she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nas deep in music as I am in paint; it was as big a chance for her as for\r\nme, you see, and she\xe2\x80\x99s making the most of it, fiddling and listening to\r\nthe fiddlers. Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a considerable change from New Hampshire.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nlooked at her dreamily, as if making an intense effort to detach himself\r\nfrom his dream, and situate her in the fading past. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember the\r\nbungalow? And Nick--ah, how\xe2\x80\x99s Nick?\xe2\x80\x9d he brought out triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes--darling Nick?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Melrose chimed in; and Susy, her head\r\nerect, her cheeks aflame, declared with resonance: \xe2\x80\x9cMost awfully\r\nwell--splendidly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not here, though?\xe2\x80\x9d from Fulmer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. He\xe2\x80\x99s off travelling--cruising.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Melrose\xe2\x80\x99s attention was faintly roused. \xe2\x80\x9cWith anybody interesting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know them. People we met....\xe2\x80\x9d She did not have to\r\ncontinue, for her hostess\xe2\x80\x99s gaze had again strayed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ve come for your clothes, I suppose, darling? Don\xe2\x80\x99t listen\r\nto people who say that skirts are to be wider. I\xe2\x80\x99ve discovered a new\r\nwoman--a Genius--and she absolutely swathes you.... Her name\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nsecret; but we\xe2\x80\x99ll go to her together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy rose from her engulphing armchair. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mind if I go up to my\r\nroom? I\xe2\x80\x99m rather tired--coming straight through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, dear. I think there are some people coming to dinner... Mrs.\r\nMatch will tell you. She has such a memory.... Fulmer, where on earth\r\nare those cartoons of the music-room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir voices pursued Susy upstairs, as, in Mrs. Match\xe2\x80\x99s perpendicular\r\nwake, she mounted to the white-panelled room with its gay linen hangings\r\nand the low bed heaped with more cushions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we\xe2\x80\x99d come here,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, \xe2\x80\x9ceverything might have been\r\ndifferent.\xe2\x80\x9d And she shuddered at the sumptuous memories of the Palazzo\r\nVanderlyn, and the great painted bedroom where she had met her doom.\r\n\r\nMrs. Match, hoping she would find everything, and mentioning that dinner\r\nwas not till nine, shut her softly in among her terrors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFind everything?\xe2\x80\x9d Susy echoed the phrase. Oh, yes, she would always\r\nfind everything: every time the door shut on her now, and the sound of\r\nvoices ceased, her memories would be there waiting for her, every one\r\nof them, waiting quietly, patiently, obstinately, like poor people in a\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s office, the people who are always last to be attended to,\r\nbut whom nothing will discourage or drive away, people to whom time is\r\nnothing, fatigue nothing, hunger nothing, other engagements nothing: who\r\njust wait.... Thank heaven, after all, that she had not found the\r\nhouse empty, if, whenever she returned to her room, she was to meet her\r\nmemories there!\r\n\r\nIt was just a week since Nick had left her. During that week, crammed\r\nwith people, questions, packing, explaining, evading, she had believed\r\nthat in solitude lay her salvation. Now she understood that there was\r\nnothing she was so unprepared for, so unfitted for. When, in all her\r\nlife, had she ever been alone? And how was she to bear it now, with all\r\nthese ravening memories besetting her!\r\n\r\nDinner not till nine? What on earth was she to do till nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock? She\r\nknelt before her boxes, and feverishly began to unpack.\r\n\r\nGradually, imperceptibly, the subtle influences of her old life were\r\nstealing into her. As she pulled out her tossed and crumpled dresses she\r\nremembered Violet\xe2\x80\x99s emphatic warning: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t believe the people who tell\r\nyou that skirts are going to be wider.\xe2\x80\x9d Were hers, perhaps, too wide\r\nas it was? She looked at her limp raiment, piling itself up on bed and\r\nsofa, and understood that, according to Violet\xe2\x80\x99s standards, and that\r\nof all her set, those dresses, which Nick had thought so original and\r\nexquisite, were already commonplace and dowdy, fit only to be passed on\r\nto poor relations or given to one\xe2\x80\x99s maid. And Susy would have to go on\r\nwearing them till they fell to bits--or else.... Well, or else begin the\r\nold life again in some new form....\r\n\r\nShe laughed aloud at the turn of her thoughts. Dresses? How little they\r\nhad mattered a few short weeks ago! And now, perhaps, they would again\r\nbe one of the foremost considerations in her life. How could it be\r\notherwise, if she were to return again to her old dependence on Ellie\r\nVanderlyn, Ursula Gillow, Violet Melrose? And beyond that, only the\r\nBockheimers and their kind awaited her....\r\n\r\nA knock on the door--what a relief! It was Mrs. Match again, with a\r\ntelegram. To whom had Susy given her new address? With a throbbing heart\r\nshe tore open the envelope and read:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall be in Paris Friday for twenty-four hours where can I see you\r\nwrite Nouveau Luxe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAh, yes--she remembered now: she had written to Strefford! And this was\r\nhis answer: he was coming. She dropped into a chair, and tried to think.\r\nWhat on earth had she said in her letter? It had been mainly, of course,\r\none of condolence; but now she remembered having added, in a precipitate\r\npostscript: \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t give your message to Nick, for he\xe2\x80\x99s gone off with\r\nthe Hickses--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where, or for how long. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right, of\r\ncourse: it was in our bargain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had not meant to put in that last phrase; but as she sealed her\r\nletter to Strefford her eye had fallen on Nick\xe2\x80\x99s missive, which lay\r\nbeside it. Nothing in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s brief lines had embittered her as\r\nmuch as the allusion to Strefford. It seemed to imply that Nick\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nplans were made, that his own future was secure, and that he could\r\ntherefore freely and handsomely take thought for hers, and give her a\r\npointer in the right direction. Sudden rage had possessed her at the\r\nthought: where she had at first read jealousy she now saw only a cold\r\nprovidence, and in a blur of tears she had scrawled her postscript to\r\nStrefford. She remembered that she had not even asked him to keep her\r\nsecret. Well--after all, what would it matter if people should already\r\nknow that Nick had left her? Their parting could not long remain a\r\nmystery, and the fact that it was known might help her to keep up a\r\npresence of indifference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was in the bargain--in the bargain,\xe2\x80\x9d rang through her brain as she\r\nre-read Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s telegram. She understood that he had snatched the\r\ntime for this hasty trip solely in the hope of seeing her, and her eyes\r\nfilled. The more bitterly she thought of Nick the more this proof of\r\nStrefford\xe2\x80\x99s friendship moved her.\r\n\r\nThe clock, to her relief, reminded her that it was time to dress for\r\ndinner. She would go down presently, chat with Violet and Fulmer, and\r\nwith Violet\xe2\x80\x99s other guests, who would probably be odd and amusing, and\r\ntoo much out of her world to embarrass her by awkward questions. She\r\nwould sit at a softly-lit table, breathe delicate scents, eat exquisite\r\nfood (trust Mrs. Match!), and be gradually drawn again under the spell\r\nof her old associations. Anything, anything but to be alone....\r\n\r\nShe dressed with even more than her habitual care, reddened her lips\r\nattentively, brushed the faintest bloom of pink over her drawn cheeks,\r\nand went down--to meet Mrs. Match coming up with a tray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Madam, I thought you were too tired.... I was bringing it up to you\r\nmyself--just a little morsel of chicken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy, glancing past her, saw, through the open door, that the lamps were\r\nnot lit in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not tired, thank you. I thought Mrs. Melrose expected\r\nfriends at dinner!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriends at dinner-to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Match heaved a despairing sigh.\r\nSometimes, the sigh seemed to say, her mistress put too great a strain\r\nupon her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mrs. Melrose and Mr. Fulmer were engaged to dine in\r\nParis. They left an hour ago. Mrs. Melrose told me she\xe2\x80\x99d told you,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nhouse-keeper wailed.\r\n\r\nSusy kept her little fixed smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI must have misunderstood. In that\r\ncase... well, yes, if it\xe2\x80\x99s no trouble, I believe I will have my tray\r\nupstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSlowly she turned, and followed the housekeeper up into the dread\r\nsolitude she had just left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE next day a lot of people turned up unannounced for luncheon. They\r\nwere not of the far-fetched and the exotic, in whom Mrs. Melrose now\r\nspecialized, but merely commonplace fashionable people belonging to\r\nSusy\xe2\x80\x99s own group, people familiar with the amusing romance of her\r\npenniless marriage, and to whom she had to explain (though none of them\r\nreally listened to the explanation) that Nick was not with her just\r\nnow but had gone off cruising... cruising in the AEgean with friends...\r\ngetting up material for his book (this detail had occurred to her in the\r\nnight).\r\n\r\nIt was the kind of encounter she had most dreaded; but it proved, after\r\nall, easy enough to go through compared with those endless hours of\r\nturning to and fro, the night before, in the cage of her lonely room.\r\nAnything, anything, but to be alone....\r\n\r\nGradually, from the force of habit, she found herself actually in tune\r\nwith the talk of the luncheon table, interested in the references to\r\nabsent friends, the light allusions to last year\xe2\x80\x99s loves and quarrels,\r\nscandals and absurdities. The women, in their pale summer dresses,\r\nwere so graceful, indolent and sure of themselves, the men so easy and\r\ngood-humoured! Perhaps, after all, Susy reflected, it was the world she\r\nwas meant for, since the other, the brief Paradise of her dreams, had\r\nalready shut its golden doors upon her. And then, as they sat on the\r\nterrace after luncheon, looking across at the yellow tree-tops of the\r\npark, one of the women said something--made just an allusion--that Susy\r\nwould have let pass unnoticed in the old days, but that now filled her\r\nwith a sudden deep disgust.... She stood up and wandered away, away from\r\nthem all through the fading garden.\r\n\r\nTwo days later Susy and Strefford sat on the terrace of the Tuileries\r\nabove the Seine. She had asked him to meet her there, with the desire to\r\navoid the crowded halls and drawing-room of the Nouveau Luxe where, even\r\nat that supposedly \xe2\x80\x9cdead\xe2\x80\x9d season, people one knew were always\r\ndrifting to and fro; and they sat on a bench in the pale sunlight,\r\nthe discoloured leaves heaped at their feet, and no one to share their\r\nsolitude but a lame working-man and a haggard woman who were lunching\r\ntogether mournfully at the other end of the majestic vista.\r\n\r\nStrefford, in his new mourning, looked unnaturally prosperous and\r\nwell-valeted; but his ugly untidy features remained as undisciplined,\r\nhis smile as whimsical, as of old. He had been on cool though friendly\r\nterms with the pompous uncle and the poor sickly cousin whose joint\r\ndisappearance had so abruptly transformed his future; and it was his\r\nway to understate his feelings rather than to pretend more than he\r\nfelt. Nevertheless, beneath his habitual bantering tone Susy discerned\r\na change. The disaster had shocked him profoundly; already, in his brief\r\nsojourn among his people and among the great possessions so tragically\r\nacquired, old instincts had awakened, forgotten associations had spoken\r\nin him. Susy listened to him wistfully, silenced by her imaginative\r\nperception of the distance that these things had put between them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was horrible... seeing them both there together, laid out in that\r\nhideous Pugin chapel at Altringham... the poor boy especially. I\r\nsuppose that\xe2\x80\x99s really what\xe2\x80\x99s cutting me up now,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, almost\r\napologetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s more than that--more than you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she insisted; but he\r\njerked back: \xe2\x80\x9cNow, my dear, don\xe2\x80\x99t be edifying, please,\xe2\x80\x9d and fumbled for\r\na cigarette in the pocket which was already beginning to bulge with his\r\nmiscellaneous properties.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now about you--for that\xe2\x80\x99s what I came for,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, turning\r\nto her with one of his sudden movements. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make head or tail\r\nof your letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused a moment to steady her voice. \xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you? I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nforgotten my bargain with Nick. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t--and he\xe2\x80\x99s asked me to fulfil\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrefford stared. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat--that nonsense about your setting each other\r\nfree if either of you had the chance to make a good match?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe signed \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he\xe2\x80\x99s actually asked you--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell: practically. He\xe2\x80\x99s gone off with the Hickses. Before going he\r\nwrote me that we\xe2\x80\x99d better both consider ourselves free. And Coral sent\r\nme a postcard to say that she would take the best of care of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrefford mused, his eyes upon his cigarette. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what the deuce led up\r\nto all this? It can\xe2\x80\x99t have happened like that, out of a clear sky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy flushed, hesitated, looked away. She had meant to tell Strefford\r\nthe whole story; it had been one of her chief reasons for wishing to see\r\nhim again, and half-unconsciously, perhaps, she had hoped, in his laxer\r\natmosphere, to recover something of her shattered self-esteem. But now\r\nshe suddenly felt the impossibility of confessing to anyone the depths\r\nto which Nick\xe2\x80\x99s wife had stooped. She fancied that her companion guessed\r\nthe nature of her hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell me anything you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to, you know, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I do want to; only it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult. You see--we had so very little\r\nmoney....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Nick--who was thinking of his book, and of all sorts of big things,\r\nfine things--didn\xe2\x80\x99t realise... left it all to me... to manage....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stumbled over the word, remembering how Nick had always winced\r\nat it. But Strefford did not seem to notice her, and she hurried on,\r\nunfolding in short awkward sentences the avowal of their pecuniary\r\ndifficulties, and of Nick\xe2\x80\x99s inability to understand that, to keep\r\non with the kind of life they were leading, one had to put up with\r\nthings... accept favours....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBorrow money, you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--yes; and all the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d No--decidedly she could not reveal\r\nto Strefford the episode of Ellie\xe2\x80\x99s letters. \xe2\x80\x9cNick suddenly felt, I\r\nsuppose, that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand it,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued; \xe2\x80\x9cand instead of\r\nasking me to try--to try to live differently, go off somewhere with him\r\nand live, like work-people, in two rooms, without a servant, as I was\r\nready to do; well, instead he wrote me that it had all been a mistake\r\nfrom the beginning, that we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep it up, and had better\r\nrecognize the fact; and he went off on the Hickses\xe2\x80\x99 yacht. The last\r\nevening that you were in Venice--the day he didn\xe2\x80\x99t come back to\r\ndinner--he had gone off to Genoa to meet them. I suppose he intends to\r\nmarry Coral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrefford received this in silence. \xe2\x80\x9cWell--it was your bargain, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d he said at length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly: I always told you so. You weren\xe2\x80\x99t ready to have him go\r\nyet--that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe flushed to the forehead. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Streff--is it really all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA question of time? If you doubt it, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see you try, for a\r\nwhile, in those two rooms without a servant; and then let me hear from\r\nyou. Why, my dear, it\xe2\x80\x99s only a question of time in a palace, with\r\na steam yacht lying off the door-step, and a flock of motors in the\r\ngarage; look around you and see. And did you ever imagine that you and\r\nNick, of all people, were going to escape the common doom, and survive\r\nlike Mr. and Mrs. Tithonus, while all about you the eternal passions\r\nwere crumbling to pieces, and your native Divorce-states piling up their\r\nrevenues?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sat with bent head, the weight of the long years to come pressing\r\nlike a leaden load on her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m so young... life\xe2\x80\x99s so long. What does last, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you\xe2\x80\x99re too young to believe me, if I were to tell you; though\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re intelligent enough to understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the hold of the things we all think we could do without.\r\nHabits--they outstand the Pyramids. Comforts, luxuries, the atmosphere\r\nof ease... above all, the power to get away from dulness and monotony,\r\nfrom constraints and uglinesses. You chose that power, instinctively,\r\nbefore you were even grown up; and so did Nick. And the only difference\r\nbetween you is that he\xe2\x80\x99s had the sense to see sooner than you that those\r\nare the things that last, the prime necessities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you don\xe2\x80\x99t: at your age one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reason one\xe2\x80\x99s materialism.\r\nAnd besides you\xe2\x80\x99re mortally hurt that Nick has found out sooner than\r\nyou, and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t disguised his discovery under any hypocritical phrases.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely there are people--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--saints and geniuses and heroes: all the fanatics! To which of\r\ntheir categories do you suppose we soft people belong? And the heroes\r\nand the geniuses--haven\xe2\x80\x99t they their enormous frailties and their giant\r\nappetites? And how should we escape being the victims of our little\r\nones?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sat for a while without speaking. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, Streff, how can you say such\r\nthings, when I know you care: care for me, for instance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCare?\xe2\x80\x9d He put his hand on hers. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear, it\xe2\x80\x99s just the\r\nfugitiveness of mortal caring that makes it so exquisite! It\xe2\x80\x99s because\r\nwe know we can\xe2\x80\x99t hold fast to it, or to each other, or to anything....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes... yes... but hush, please! Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t say it!\xe2\x80\x9d She stood up, the\r\ntears in her throat, and he rose also.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along, then; where do we lunch?\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a smile, slipping\r\nhis hand through her arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Nowhere. I think I\xe2\x80\x99m going back to Versailles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I\xe2\x80\x99ve disgusted you so deeply? Just my luck--when I came over to\r\nask you to marry me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed, but he had become suddenly grave. \xe2\x80\x9cUpon my soul, I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Streff! As if--now--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, not now--I know. I\xe2\x80\x99m aware that even with your accelerated divorce\r\nmethods--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not that. I told you it was no use, Streff--I told you long ago,\r\nin Venice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shrugged ironically. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not Streff who\xe2\x80\x99s asking you now. Streff\r\nwas not a marrying man: he was only trifling with you. The present offer\r\ncomes from an elderly peer of independent means. Think it over, my dear:\r\nas many days out as you like, and five footmen kept. There\xe2\x80\x99s not the\r\nleast hurry, of course; but I rather think Nick himself would advise\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe flushed to the temples, remembering that Nick had; and the\r\nremembrance made Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s sneering philosophy seem less unbearable.\r\nWhy should she not lunch with him, after all? In the first days of his\r\nmourning he had come to Paris expressly to see her, and to offer her\r\none of the oldest names and one of the greatest fortunes in England.\r\nShe thought of Ursula Gillow, Ellie Vanderlyn, Violet Melrose, of their\r\ncondescending kindnesses, their last year\xe2\x80\x99s dresses, their Christmas\r\ncheques, and all the careless bounties that were so easy to bestow and\r\nso hard to accept. \xe2\x80\x9cI should rather enjoy paying them back,\xe2\x80\x9d something\r\nin her maliciously murmured.\r\n\r\nShe did not mean to marry Strefford--she had not even got as far as\r\ncontemplating the possibility of a divorce but it was undeniable that\r\nthis sudden prospect of wealth and freedom was like fresh air in her\r\nlungs. She laughed again, but now without bitterness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, then; we\xe2\x80\x99ll lunch together. But it\xe2\x80\x99s Streff I want to lunch\r\nwith to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well,\xe2\x80\x9d her companion agreed, \xe2\x80\x9cI rather think that for a t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s better company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring their repast in a little restaurant over the Seine, where she\r\ninsisted on the cheapest dishes because she was lunching with \xe2\x80\x9cStreff,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he became again his old whimsical companionable self. Once or twice she\r\ntried to turn the talk to his altered future, and the obligations and\r\ninterests that lay before him; but he shrugged away from the subject,\r\nquestioning her instead about the motley company at Violet Melrose\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand fitting a droll or malicious anecdote to each of the people she\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\nIt was not till they had finished their coffee, and she was glancing at\r\nher watch with a vague notion of taking the next train, that he asked\r\nabruptly: \xe2\x80\x9cBut what are you going to do? You can\xe2\x80\x99t stay forever at\r\nViolet\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried with a shiver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then--you\xe2\x80\x99ve got some plan, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I?\xe2\x80\x9d she wondered, jerked back into grim reality from the soothing\r\ninterlude of their hour together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t drift indefinitely, can you? Unless you mean to go back to\r\nthe old sort of life once for all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe reddened and her eyes filled. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t do that, Streff--I know I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, and brought out with lowered head: \xe2\x80\x9cNick said he would\r\nwrite again--in a few days. I must wait--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, naturally. Don\xe2\x80\x99t do anything in a hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d Strefford also glanced at\r\nhis watch. \xe2\x80\x9cGarcon, l\xe2\x80\x99addition! I\xe2\x80\x99m taking the train back to-night, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve a lot of things left to do. But look here, my dear--when you come\r\nto a decision one way or the other let me know, will you? Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmean in the matter I\xe2\x80\x99ve most at heart; we\xe2\x80\x99ll consider that closed for\r\nthe present. But at least I can be of use in other ways--hang it, you\r\nknow, I can even lend you money. There\xe2\x80\x99s a new sensation for our jaded\r\npalates!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Streff... Streff!\xe2\x80\x9d she could only falter; and he pressed on gaily:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry it, now do try it--I assure you there\xe2\x80\x99ll be no interest to pay, and\r\nno conditions attached. And promise to let me know when you\xe2\x80\x99ve decided\r\nanything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked into his humorously puckered eyes, answering. Their friendly\r\nsmile with hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT hour with Strefford had altered her whole perspective. Instead of\r\npossible dependence, an enforced return to the old life of connivances\r\nand concessions, she saw before her--whenever she chose to take\r\nthem--freedom, power and dignity. Dignity! It was odd what weight that\r\nword had come to have for her. She had dimly felt its significance,\r\nfelt the need of its presence in her inmost soul, even in the young\r\nthoughtless days when she had seemed to sacrifice so little to the\r\naustere divinities. And since she had been Nick Lansing\xe2\x80\x99s wife she had\r\nconsciously acknowledged it, had suffered and agonized when she fell\r\nbeneath its standard. Yes: to marry Strefford would give her that\r\nsense of self-respect which, in such a world as theirs, only wealth and\r\nposition could ensure. If she had not the mental or moral training to\r\nattain independence in any other way, was she to blame for seeking it on\r\nsuch terms?\r\n\r\nOf course there was always the chance that Nick would come back, would\r\nfind life without her as intolerable as she was finding it without him.\r\nIf that happened--ah, if that happened! Then she would cease to strain\r\nher eyes into the future, would seize upon the present moment and plunge\r\ninto it to the very bottom of oblivion. Nothing on earth would matter\r\nthen--money or freedom or pride, or her precious moral dignity, if only\r\nshe were in Nick\xe2\x80\x99s arms again!\r\n\r\nBut there was Nick\xe2\x80\x99s icy letter, there was Coral Hicks\xe2\x80\x99s insolent\r\npost-card, to show how little chance there was of such a solution. Susy\r\nunderstood that, even before the discovery of her transaction with Ellie\r\nVanderlyn, Nick had secretly wearied, if not of his wife, at least of\r\nthe life that their marriage compelled him to lead. His passion was not\r\nstrong enough--had never been strong enough--to outweigh his prejudices,\r\nscruples, principles, or whatever one chose to call them. Susy\xe2\x80\x99s dignity\r\nmight go up like tinder in the blaze of her love; but his was made of a\r\nless combustible substance. She had felt, in their last talk together,\r\nthat she had forever destroyed the inner harmony between them.\r\n\r\nWell--there it was, and the fault was doubtless neither hers nor his,\r\nbut that of the world they had grown up in, of their own moral contempt\r\nfor it and physical dependence on it, of his half-talents and her\r\nhalf-principles, of the something in them both that was not stout enough\r\nto resist nor yet pliant enough to yield. She stared at the fact on the\r\njourney back to Versailles, and all that sleepless night in her room;\r\nand the next morning, when the housemaid came in with her breakfast\r\ntray, she felt the factitious energy that comes from having decided,\r\nhowever half-heartedly, on a definite course.\r\n\r\nShe had said to herself: \xe2\x80\x9cIf there\xe2\x80\x99s no letter from Nick this time next\r\nweek I\xe2\x80\x99ll write to Streff--\xe2\x80\x9d and the week had passed, and there was no\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nIt was now three weeks since he had left her, and she had had no\r\nword but his note from Genoa. She had concluded that, foreseeing the\r\nprobability of her leaving Venice, he would write to her in care of\r\ntheir Paris bank. But though she had immediately notified the bank of\r\nher change of address no communication from Nick had reached her; and\r\nshe smiled with a touch of bitterness at the difficulty he was doubtless\r\nfinding in the composition of the promised letter. Her own scrap-basket,\r\nfor the first days, had been heaped with the fragments of the letters\r\nshe had begun; and she told herself that, since they both found it so\r\nhard to write, it was probably because they had nothing left to say to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the days at Mrs. Melrose\xe2\x80\x99s drifted by as they had been wont\r\nto drift when, under the roofs of the rich, Susy Branch had marked\r\ntime between one episode and the next of her precarious existence.\r\nHer experience of such sojourns was varied enough to make her acutely\r\nconscious of their effect on her temporary hosts; and in the present\r\ncase she knew that Violet was hardly aware of her presence. But if no\r\nmore than tolerated she was at least not felt to be an inconvenience;\r\nwhen your hostess forgot about you it proved that at least you were not\r\nin her way.\r\n\r\nViolet, as usual, was perpetually on the wing, for her profound\r\nindolence expressed itself in a disordered activity. Nat Fulmer had\r\nreturned to Paris; but Susy guessed that his benefactress was still\r\nconstantly in his company, and that when Mrs. Melrose was whirled away\r\nin her noiseless motor it was generally toward the scene of some new\r\nencounter between Fulmer and the arts. On these occasions she sometimes\r\noffered to carry Susy to Paris, and they devoted several long and\r\nhectic mornings to the dress-makers, where Susy felt herself gradually\r\nsuccumbing to the familiar spell of heaped-up finery. It seemed\r\nimpossible, as furs and laces and brocades were tossed aside, brought\r\nback, and at last carelessly selected from, that anything but the whim\r\nof the moment need count in deciding whether one should take all or\r\nnone, or that any woman could be worth looking at who did not possess\r\nthe means to make her choice regardless of cost.\r\n\r\nOnce alone, and in the street again, the evil fumes would evaporate,\r\nand daylight re-enter Susy\xe2\x80\x99s soul; yet she felt that the old poison was\r\nslowly insinuating itself into her system. To dispel it she decided\r\none day to look up Grace Fulmer. She was curious to know how the\r\nhappy-go-lucky companion of Fulmer\xe2\x80\x99s evil days was bearing the weight of\r\nhis prosperity, and she vaguely felt that it would be refreshing to see\r\nsome one who had never been afraid of poverty.\r\n\r\nThe airless pension sitting-room, where she waited while a reluctant\r\nmaid-servant screamed about the house for Mrs. Fulmer, did not have\r\nthe hoped-for effect. It was one thing for Grace to put up with such\r\nquarters when she shared them with Fulmer; but to live there while he\r\nbasked in the lingering radiance of Versailles, or rolled from chateau\r\nto picture gallery in Mrs. Melrose\xe2\x80\x99s motor, showed a courage that Susy\r\nfelt unable to emulate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear! I knew you\xe2\x80\x99d look me up,\xe2\x80\x9d Grace\xe2\x80\x99s joyous voice ran down the\r\nstairway; and in another moment she was clasping Susy to her tumbled\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat couldn\xe2\x80\x99t remember if he\xe2\x80\x99d given you our address, though he promised\r\nme he would, the last time he was here.\xe2\x80\x9d She held Susy at arms\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlength, beaming upon her with blinking short-sighted eyes: the same\r\nold dishevelled Grace, so careless of her neglected beauty and her\r\nsquandered youth, so amused and absent-minded and improvident, that the\r\nboisterous air of the New Hampshire bungalow seemed to enter with her\r\ninto the little air-tight salon.\r\n\r\nWhile she poured out the tale of Nat\xe2\x80\x99s sudden celebrity, and its\r\nunexpected consequences, Susy marvelled and dreamed. Was the secret\r\nof his triumph perhaps due to those long hard unrewarded years, the\r\nsteadfast scorn of popularity, the indifference to every kind of\r\nmaterial ease in which his wife had so gaily abetted him? Had it been\r\nbought at the cost of her own freshness and her own talent, of the\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cadvantages,\xe2\x80\x9d of everything except the closeness of the tie\r\nbetween husband and wife? Well--it was worth the price, no doubt; but\r\nwhat if, now that honours and prosperity had come, the tie were snapped,\r\nand Grace were left alone among the ruins?\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in her tone or words to suggest such a possibility.\r\nSusy noticed that her ill-assorted raiment was costlier in quality and\r\nmore professional in cut than the home-made garments which had draped\r\nher growing bulk at the bungalow: it was clear that she was trying to\r\ndress up to Nat\xe2\x80\x99s new situation. But, above all, she was rejoicing in\r\nit, filling her hungry lungs with the strong air of his success. It had\r\nevidently not occurred to her as yet that those who consent to share the\r\nbread of adversity may want the whole cake of prosperity for themselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, it\xe2\x80\x99s too wonderful! He\xe2\x80\x99s told me to take as many concert and\r\nopera tickets as I like; he lets me take all the children with me. The\r\nbig concerts don\xe2\x80\x99t begin till later; but of course the Opera is always\r\ngoing. And there are little things--there\xe2\x80\x99s music in Paris at all\r\nseasons. And later it\xe2\x80\x99s just possible we may get to Munich for a\r\nweek--oh, Susy!\xe2\x80\x9d Her hands clasped, her eyes brimming, she drank the new\r\nwine of life almost sacramentally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember, Susy, when you and Nick came to stay at the bungalow?\r\nNat said you\xe2\x80\x99d be horrified by our primitiveness--but I knew better! And\r\nI was right, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I? Seeing us so happy made you and Nick decide to\r\nfollow our example, didn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d She glowed with the remembrance. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nnow, what are your plans? Is Nick\xe2\x80\x99s book nearly done? I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave to live very economically till he finds a publisher. And the baby,\r\ndarling--when is that to be? If you\xe2\x80\x99re coming home soon I could let you\r\nhave a lot of the children\xe2\x80\x99s little old things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re always so dear, Grace. But we haven\xe2\x80\x99t any special plans\r\nas yet--not even for a baby. And I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d tell me all of yours\r\ninstead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Fulmer asked nothing better: Susy perceived that, so far, the\r\ngreater part of her European experience had consisted in talking about\r\nwhat it was to be. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see, Nat is so taken up all day with\r\nsight-seeing and galleries and meeting important people that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhad time to go about with us; and as so few theatres are open, and\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s so little music, I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken the opportunity to catch up with\r\nmy mending. Junie helps me with it now--she\xe2\x80\x99s our eldest, you remember?\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s grown into a big girl since you saw her. And later, perhaps,\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re to travel. And the most wonderful thing of all--next to Nat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrecognition, I mean--is not having to contrive and skimp, and give up\r\nsomething every single minute. Just think--Nat has even made special\r\narrangements here in the pension, so that the children all have second\r\nhelpings to everything. And when I go up to bed I can think of my music,\r\ninstead of lying awake calculating and wondering how I can make things\r\ncome out at the end of the month. Oh, Susy, that\xe2\x80\x99s simply heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy\xe2\x80\x99s heart contracted. She had come to her friend to be taught again\r\nthe lesson of indifference to material things, and instead she was\r\nhearing from Grace Fulmer\xe2\x80\x99s lips the long-repressed avowal of their\r\ntyranny. After all, that battle with poverty on the New Hampshire\r\nhillside had not been the easy smiling business that Grace and Nat had\r\nmade it appear. And yet ... and yet....\r\n\r\nSusy stood up abruptly, and straightened the expensive hat which hung\r\nirresponsibly over Grace\xe2\x80\x99s left ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with it? Junie helped me choose it, and she generally\r\nknows,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Fulmer wailed with helpless hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the way you wear it, dearest--and the bow is rather top-heavy. Let\r\nme have it a minute, please.\xe2\x80\x9d Susy lifted the hat from her friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead and began to manipulate its trimming. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the way Maria Guy or\r\nSuzanne would do it.... And now go on about Nat....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe listened musingly while Grace poured forth the tale of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntriumph, of the notices in the papers, the demand for his work, the\r\nfine ladies\xe2\x80\x99 battles over their priority in discovering him, and the\r\nmultiplied orders that had resulted from their rivalry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course they\xe2\x80\x99re simply furious with each other--Mrs. Melrose and Mrs.\r\nGillow especially--because each one pretends to have been the first to\r\nnotice his \xe2\x80\x98Spring Snow-Storm,\xe2\x80\x99 and in reality it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t either of them,\r\nbut only poor Bill Haslett, an art-critic we\xe2\x80\x99ve known for years, who\r\nchanced on the picture, and rushed off to tell a dealer who was looking\r\nfor a new painter to push.\xe2\x80\x9d Grace suddenly raised her soft myopic eyes\r\nto Susy\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, do you know, the funny thing is that I believe Nat\r\nis beginning to forget this, and to believe that it was Mrs. Melrose who\r\nstopped short in front of his picture on the opening day, and screamed\r\nout: \xe2\x80\x98This is genius!\xe2\x80\x99 It seems funny he should care so much, when I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nalways known he had genius--and he has known it too. But they\xe2\x80\x99re all so\r\nkind to him; and Mrs. Melrose especially. And I suppose it makes a thing\r\nsound new to hear it said in a new voice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy looked at her meditatively. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how should you feel if Nat liked\r\ntoo much to hear Mrs. Melrose say it? Too much, I mean, to care any\r\nlonger what you felt or thought?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer friend\xe2\x80\x99s worn face flushed quickly, and then paled: Susy almost\r\nrepented the question. But Mrs. Fulmer met it with a tranquil dignity.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t been married long enough, dear, to understand... how people\r\nlike Nat and me feel about such things... or how trifling they seem, in\r\nthe balance... the balance of one\xe2\x80\x99s memories.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy stood up again, and flung her arms about her friend. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Grace,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she laughed with wet eyes, \xe2\x80\x9chow can you be as wise as that, and yet not\r\nhave sense enough to buy a decent hat?\xe2\x80\x9d She gave Mrs. Fulmer a quick\r\nembrace and hurried away. She had learned her lesson after all; but it\r\nwas not exactly the one she had come to seek.\r\n\r\nThe week she had allowed herself had passed, and still there was no word\r\nfrom Nick. She allowed herself yet another day, and that too went by\r\nwithout a letter. She then decided on a step from which her pride\r\nhad hitherto recoiled; she would call at the bank and ask for Nick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naddress. She called, embarrassed and hesitating; and was told, after\r\nenquiries in the post-office department, that Mr. Nicholas Lansing\r\nhad given no address since that of the Palazzo Vanderlyn, three months\r\npreviously. She went back to Versailles that afternoon with the definite\r\nintention of writing to Strefford unless the next morning\xe2\x80\x99s post brought\r\na letter.\r\n\r\nThe next morning brought nothing from Nick, but a scribbled message from\r\nMrs. Melrose: would Susy, as soon as possible, come into her room for\r\na word, Susy jumped up, hurried through her bath, and knocked at her\r\nhostess\xe2\x80\x99s door. In the immense low bed that faced the rich umbrage\r\nof the park Mrs. Melrose lay smoking cigarettes and glancing over her\r\nletters. She looked up with her vague smile, and said dreamily: \xe2\x80\x9cSusy\r\ndarling, have you any particular plans--for the next few months, I\r\nmean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy coloured: she knew the intonation of old, and fancied she\r\nunderstood what it implied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlans, dearest? Any number... I\xe2\x80\x99m tearing myself away the day after\r\nto-morrow... to the Gillows\xe2\x80\x99 moor, very probably,\xe2\x80\x9d she hastened to\r\nannounce.\r\n\r\nInstead of the relief she had expected to read on Mrs. Melrose\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndramatic countenance she discovered there the blankest disappointment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, really? That\xe2\x80\x99s too bad. Is it absolutely settled--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susy crisply.\r\n\r\nThe other sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m too sorry. You see, dear, I\xe2\x80\x99d meant to ask you\r\nto stay on here quietly and look after the Fulmer children. Fulmer and\r\nI are going to Spain next week--I want to be with him when he makes his\r\nstudies, receives his first impressions; such a marvellous experience,\r\nto be there when he and Velasquez meet!\xe2\x80\x9d She broke off, lost in\r\nprospective ecstasy. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, you see, as Grace Fulmer insists on coming\r\nwith us--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there are the five children--such a problem,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed the\r\nbenefactress. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you were at a loose end, you know, dear, while Nick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naway with his friends, I could really make it worth your while....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo awfully good of you, Violet; only I\xe2\x80\x99m not, as it happens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh the relief of being able to say that, gaily, firmly and even\r\ntruthfully! Take charge of the Fulmer children, indeed! Susy remembered\r\nhow Nick and she had fled from them that autumn afternoon in New\r\nHampshire. The offer gave her a salutary glimpse of the way in which, as\r\nthe years passed, and she lost her freshness and novelty, she would more\r\nand more be used as a convenience, a stop-gap, writer of notes, runner\r\nof errands, nursery governess or companion. She called to mind several\r\nelderly women of her acquaintance, pensioners of her own group, who\r\nstill wore its livery, struck its attitudes and chattered its jargon,\r\nbut had long since been ruthlessly relegated to these slave-ant offices.\r\nNever in the world would she join their numbers.\r\n\r\nMrs. Melrose\xe2\x80\x99s face fell, and she looked at Susy with the plaintive\r\nbewilderment of the wielder of millions to whom everything that cannot\r\nbe bought is imperceptible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t see why you can\xe2\x80\x99t change your plans,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured with a\r\nsoft persistency.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, you know\xe2\x80\x9d--Susy paused on a slow inward smile--\xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re not\r\nmine only, as it happens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Melrose\xe2\x80\x99s brow clouded. The unforeseen complication of Mrs.\r\nFulmer\xe2\x80\x99s presence on the journey had evidently tried her nerves, and\r\nthis new obstacle to her arrangements shook her faith in the divine\r\norder of things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour plans are not yours only? But surely you won\xe2\x80\x99t let Ursula Gillow\r\ndictate to you?... There\xe2\x80\x99s my jade pendant; the one you said you liked\r\nthe other day.... The Fulmers won\xe2\x80\x99t go with me, you understand, unless\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re satisfied about the children; the whole plan will fall\r\nthrough. Susy darling, you were always too unselfish; I hate to see you\r\nsacrificed to Ursula.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy\xe2\x80\x99s smile lingered. Time was when she might have been glad to add\r\nthe jade pendant to the collection already enriched by Ellie Vanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsapphires; more recently, she would have resented the offer as an insult\r\nto her newly-found principles. But already the mere fact that she\r\nmight henceforth, if she chose, be utterly out of reach of such bribes,\r\nenabled her to look down on them with tolerance. Oh, the blessed moral\r\nfreedom that wealth conferred! She recalled Mrs. Fulmer\xe2\x80\x99s uncontrollable\r\ncry: \xe2\x80\x9cThe most wonderful thing of all is not having to contrive and\r\nskimp, and give up something every single minute!\xe2\x80\x9d Yes; it was only on\r\nsuch terms that one could call one\xe2\x80\x99s soul one\xe2\x80\x99s own. The sense of it\r\ngave Susy the grace to answer amicably: \xe2\x80\x9cIf I could possibly help you\r\nout, Violet, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want a present to persuade me. And, as you say,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why I should sacrifice myself to Ursula--or to anybody\r\nelse. Only, as it happens\xe2\x80\x9d--she paused and took the plunge--\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going\r\nto England because I\xe2\x80\x99ve promised to see a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d That night she wrote\r\nto Strefford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRETCHED out under an awning on the deck of the Ibis, Nick Lansing\r\nlooked up for a moment at the vanishing cliffs of Malta and then plunged\r\nagain into his book.\r\n\r\nHe had had nearly three weeks of drug-taking on the Ibis. The drugs he\r\nhad absorbed were of two kinds: visions of fleeing landscapes, looming\r\nup from the blue sea to vanish into it again, and visions of study\r\nabsorbed from the volumes piled up day and night at his elbow. For the\r\nfirst time in months he was in reach of a real library, just the kind\r\nof scholarly yet miscellaneous library, that his restless and impatient\r\nspirit craved. He was aware that the books he read, like the fugitive\r\nscenes on which he gazed, were merely a form of anesthetic: he swallowed\r\nthem with the careless greed of the sufferer who seeks only to still\r\npain and deaden memory. But they were beginning to produce in him a\r\nmoral languor that was not disagreeable, that, indeed, compared with the\r\nfierce pain of the first days, was almost pleasurable. It was exactly\r\nthe kind of drug that he needed.\r\n\r\nThere is probably no point on which the average man has more definite\r\nviews than on the uselessness of writing a letter that is hard to write.\r\nIn the line he had sent to Susy from Genoa Nick had told her that she\r\nwould hear from him again in a few days; but when the few days had\r\npassed, and he began to consider setting himself to the task, he found\r\nfifty reasons for postponing it.\r\n\r\nHad there been any practical questions to write about it would have been\r\ndifferent; he could not have borne for twenty-four hours the idea that\r\nshe was in uncertainty as to money. But that had all been settled\r\nlong ago. From the first she had had the administering of their modest\r\nfortune. On their marriage Nick\xe2\x80\x99s own meagre income, paid in, none too\r\nregularly, by the agent who had managed for years the dwindling family\r\nproperties, had been transferred to her: it was the only wedding present\r\nhe could make. And the wedding cheques had of course all been\r\ndeposited in her name. There were therefore no \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness\xe2\x80\x9d reasons for\r\ncommunicating with her; and when it came to reasons of another order the\r\nmere thought of them benumbed him.\r\n\r\nFor the first few days he reproached himself for his inertia; then he\r\nbegan to seek reasons for justifying it. After all, for both their sakes\r\na waiting policy might be the wisest he could pursue. He had left Susy\r\nbecause he could not tolerate the conditions on which he had discovered\r\ntheir life together to be based; and he had told her so. What more was\r\nthere to say?\r\n\r\nNothing was changed in their respective situations; if they came\r\ntogether it could be only to resume the same life; and that, as the days\r\nwent by, seemed to him more and more impossible. He had not yet reached\r\nthe point of facing a definite separation; but whenever his thoughts\r\ntravelled back over their past life he recoiled from any attempt to\r\nreturn to it. As long as this state of mind continued there seemed\r\nnothing to add to the letter he had already written, except indeed the\r\nstatement that he was cruising with the Hickses. And he saw no pressing\r\nreason for communicating that.\r\n\r\nTo the Hickses he had given no hint of his situation. When Coral Hicks,\r\na fortnight earlier, had picked him up in the broiling streets of Genoa,\r\nand carried him off to the Ibis, he had thought only of a cool dinner\r\nand perhaps a moonlight sail. Then, in reply to their friendly urging,\r\nhe had confessed that he had not been well--had indeed gone off\r\nhurriedly for a few days\xe2\x80\x99 change of air--and that left him without\r\ndefence against the immediate proposal that he should take his change\r\nof air on the Ibis. They were just off to Corsica and Sardinia, and from\r\nthere to Sicily: he could rejoin the railway at Naples, and be back at\r\nVenice in ten days.\r\n\r\nTen days of respite--the temptation was irresistible. And he really\r\nliked the kind uncomplicated Hickses. A wholesome honesty and simplicity\r\nbreathed through all their opulence, as if the rich trappings of their\r\npresent life still exhaled the fragrance of their native prairies. The\r\nmere fact of being with such people was like a purifying bath. When the\r\nyacht touched at Naples he agreed since they were so awfully kind--to go\r\non to Sicily. And when the chief steward, going ashore at Naples for\r\nthe last time before they got up steam, said: \xe2\x80\x9cAny letters for the post,\r\nsir?\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, as he had answered at each previous halt: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank\r\nyou: none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow they were heading for Rhodes and Crete--Crete, where he had never\r\nbeen, where he had so often longed to go. In spite of the lateness of\r\nthe season the weather was still miraculously fine: the short waves\r\ndanced ahead under a sky without a cloud, and the strong bows of the\r\nIbis hardly swayed as she flew forward over the flying crests.\r\n\r\nOnly his hosts and their daughter were on the yacht--of course with\r\nEldorada Tooker and Mr. Beck in attendance. An eminent archaeologist,\r\nwho was to have joined them at Naples, had telegraphed an excuse at the\r\nlast moment; and Nick noticed that, while Mrs. Hicks was perpetually\r\napologizing for the great man\xe2\x80\x99s absence, Coral merely smiled and said\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Mr. and Mrs. Hicks were never as pleasant as\r\nwhen one had them to one\xe2\x80\x99s self. In company, Mr. Hicks ran the risk of\r\nappearing over-hospitable, and Mrs. Hicks confused dates and names in\r\nthe desire to embrace all culture in her conversation. But alone with\r\nNick, their old travelling-companion, they shone out in their native\r\nsimplicity, and Mr. Hicks talked soundly of investments, and Mrs. Hicks\r\nrecalled her early married days in Apex City, when, on being brought\r\nhome to her new house in Aeschylus Avenue, her first thought had been:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow on earth shall I get all those windows washed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe loss of Mr. Buttles had been as serious to them as Nick had\r\nsupposed: Mr. Beck could never hope to replace him. Apart from his\r\nmysterious gift of languages, and his almost superhuman faculty for\r\nknowing how to address letters to eminent people, and in what terms to\r\nconclude them, he had a smattering of archaeology and general culture on\r\nwhich Mrs. Hicks had learned to depend--her own memory being, alas, so\r\ninadequate to the range of her interests.\r\n\r\nHer daughter might perhaps have helped her; but it was not Miss Hicks\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nway to mother her parents. She was exceedingly kind to them, but left\r\nthem, as it were, to bring themselves up as best they could, while she\r\npursued her own course of self-development. A sombre zeal for knowledge\r\nfilled the mind of this strange girl: she appeared interested only\r\nin fresh opportunities of adding to her store of facts. They were\r\nilluminated by little imagination and less poetry; but, carefully\r\ncatalogued and neatly sorted in her large cool brain, they were always\r\nas accessible as the volumes in an up-to-date public library.\r\n\r\nTo Nick there was something reposeful in this lucid intellectual\r\ncuriosity. He wanted above all things to get away from sentiment, from\r\nseduction, from the moods and impulses and flashing contradictions that\r\nwere Susy. Susy was not a great reader: her store of facts was small,\r\nand she had grown up among people who dreaded ideas as much as if they\r\nhad been a contagious disease. But, in the early days especially,\r\nwhen Nick had put a book in her hand, or read a poem to her, her\r\nswift intelligence had instantly shed a new light on the subject, and,\r\npenetrating to its depths, had extracted from them whatever belonged\r\nto her. What a pity that this exquisite insight, this intuitive\r\ndiscrimination, should for the most part have been spent upon reading\r\nthe thoughts of vulgar people, and extracting a profit from them--should\r\nhave been wasted, since her childhood, on all the hideous intricacies of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmanaging\xe2\x80\x9d!\r\n\r\nAnd visible beauty--how she cared for that too! He had not guessed it,\r\nor rather he had not been sure of it, till the day when, on their way\r\nthrough Paris, he had taken her to the Louvre, and they had stood before\r\nthe little Crucifixion of Mantegna. He had not been looking at the\r\npicture, or watching to see what impression it produced on Susy. His\r\nown momentary mood was for Correggio and Fragonard, the laughter of the\r\nMusic Lesson and the bold pagan joys of the Antiope; and then he\r\nhad missed her from his side, and when he came to where she stood,\r\nforgetting him, forgetting everything, had seen the glare of that tragic\r\nsky in her face, her trembling lip, the tears on her lashes. That was\r\nSusy....\r\n\r\nClosing his book he stole a glance at Coral Hicks\xe2\x80\x99s profile, thrown back\r\nagainst the cushions of the deck-chair at his side. There was something\r\nharsh and bracing in her blunt primitive build, in the projection of\r\nthe black eyebrows that nearly met over her thick straight nose, and\r\nthe faint barely visible black down on her upper lip. Some miracle of\r\nwill-power, combined with all the artifices that wealth can buy, had\r\nturned the fat sallow girl he remembered into this commanding young\r\nwoman, almost handsome at times indisputably handsome--in her big\r\nauthoritative way. Watching the arrogant lines of her profile against\r\nthe blue sea, he remembered, with a thrill that was sweet to his vanity,\r\nhow twice--under the dome of the Scalzi and in the streets of Genoa--he\r\nhad seen those same lines soften at his approach, turn womanly, pleading\r\nand almost humble. That was Coral....\r\n\r\nSuddenly she said, without turning toward him: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve had no letters\r\nsince you\xe2\x80\x99ve been on board.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, surprised. \xe2\x80\x9cNo--thank the Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you haven\xe2\x80\x99t written one either,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued in her hard\r\nstatistical tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he again agreed, with the same laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat means that you really are free--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFree?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe saw the cheek nearest him redden. \xe2\x80\x9cReally off on a holiday, I mean;\r\nnot tied down.\xe2\x80\x9d After a pause he rejoined: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not particularly\r\ntied down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your book?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my book--\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped and considered. He had thrust The Pageant of\r\nAlexander into his handbag on the night of his Bight from Venice; but\r\nsince then he had never looked at it. Too many memories and illusions\r\nwere pressed between its pages; and he knew just at what page he had\r\nfelt Ellie Vanderlyn bending over him from behind, caught a whiff of her\r\nscent, and heard her breathless \xe2\x80\x9cI had to thank you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy book\xe2\x80\x99s hung up,\xe2\x80\x9d he said impatiently, annoyed with Miss Hicks\xe2\x80\x99s lack\r\nof tact. There was a girl who never put out feelers....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I thought it was,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on quietly, and he gave her a startled\r\nglance. What the devil else did she think, he wondered? He had never\r\nsupposed her capable of getting far enough out of her own thick carapace\r\nof self-sufficiency to penetrate into any one else\xe2\x80\x99s feelings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, embarrassed, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I dug away at\r\nit rather too continuously; that\xe2\x80\x99s probably why I felt the need of a\r\nchange. You see I\xe2\x80\x99m only a beginner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe still continued her relentless questioning. \xe2\x80\x9cBut later--you\xe2\x80\x99ll go on\r\nwith it, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused, glanced down the glittering deck, and\r\nthen out across the glittering water. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been dreaming dreams, you\r\nsee. I rather think I shall have to drop the book altogether, and try\r\nto look out for a job that will pay. To indulge in my kind of literature\r\none must first have an assured income.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was instantly annoyed with himself for having spoken. Hitherto in his\r\nrelations with the Hickses he had carefully avoided the least allusion\r\nthat might make him feel the heavy hand of their beneficence. But the\r\nidle procrastinating weeks had weakened him and he had yielded to the\r\nneed of putting into words his vague intentions. To do so would perhaps\r\nhelp to make them more definite.\r\n\r\nTo his relief Miss Hicks made no immediate reply; and when she spoke it\r\nwas in a softer voice and with an unwonted hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems a shame that with gifts like yours you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t find some\r\nkind of employment that would leave you leisure enough to do your real\r\nwork....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shrugged ironically. \xe2\x80\x9cYes--there are a goodish number of us hunting\r\nfor that particular kind of employment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer tone became more business-like. \xe2\x80\x9cI know it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to find--almost\r\nimpossible. But would you take it, I wonder, if it were offered to\r\nyou--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned her head slightly, and their eyes met. For an instant blank\r\nterror loomed upon him; but before he had time to face it she continued,\r\nin the same untroubled voice: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Buttles\xe2\x80\x99s place, I mean. My parents\r\nmust absolutely have some one they can count on. You know what an easy\r\nplace it is.... I think you would find the salary satisfactory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNick drew a deep breath of relief. For a moment her eyes had looked as\r\nthey had in the Scalzi--and he liked the girl too much not to shrink\r\nfrom reawakening that look. But Mr. Buttles\xe2\x80\x99s place: why not?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Buttles!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, to gain time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou won\xe2\x80\x99t find the same reasons as he did for throwing\r\nup the job. He was the martyr of his artistic convictions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe glanced at her sideways, wondering. After all she did not know of\r\nhis meeting with Mr. Buttles in Genoa, nor of the latter\xe2\x80\x99s confidences;\r\nperhaps she did not even know of Mr. Buttles\xe2\x80\x99s hopeless passion. At any\r\nrate her face remained calm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not consider it--at least just for a few months? Till after our\r\nexpedition to Mesopotamia?\xe2\x80\x9d she pressed on, a little breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re awfully kind: but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stood up with one of her abrupt movements. \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t, all\r\nat once. Take time think it over. Father wanted me to ask you,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nappended.\r\n\r\nHe felt the inadequacy of his response. \xe2\x80\x9cIt tempts me awfully, of\r\ncourse. But I must wait, at any rate--wait for letters. The fact is\r\nI shall have to wire from Rhodes to have them sent. I had chucked\r\neverything, even letters, for a few weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you are tired,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, giving him a last downward glance as\r\nshe turned away.\r\n\r\nFrom Rhodes Nick Lansing telegraphed to his Paris bank to send his\r\nletters to Candia; but when the Ibis reached Candia, and the mail was\r\nbrought on board, the thick envelope handed to him contained no letter\r\nfrom Susy.\r\n\r\nWhy should it, since he had not yet written to her?\r\n\r\nHe had not written, no: but in sending his address to the bank he knew\r\nhe had given her the opportunity of reaching him if she wished to. And\r\nshe had made no sign.\r\n\r\nLate that afternoon, when they returned to the yacht from their first\r\nexpedition, a packet of newspapers lay on the deck-house table. Nick\r\npicked up one of the London journals, and his eye ran absently down the\r\nlist of social events.\r\n\r\nHe read:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmong the visitors expected next week at Ruan Castle (let for the\r\nseason to Mr. Frederick J. Gillow of New York) are Prince Altineri of\r\nRome, the Earl of Altringham and Mrs. Nicholas Lansing, who arrived in\r\nLondon last week from Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d Nick threw down the paper. It was just a\r\nmonth since he had left the Palazzo Vanderlyn and flung himself into the\r\nnight express for Milan. A whole month--and Susy had not written. Only a\r\nmonth--and Susy and Strefford were already together!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUSY had decided to wait for Strefford in London.\r\n\r\nThe new Lord Altringham was with his family in the north, and though she\r\nfound a telegram on arriving, saying that he would join her in town the\r\nfollowing week, she had still an interval of several days to fill.\r\n\r\nLondon was a desert; the rain fell without ceasing, and alone in the\r\nshabby family hotel which, even out of season, was the best she could\r\nafford, she sat at last face to face with herself.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment when Violet Melrose had failed to carry out her plan\r\nfor the Fulmer children her interest in Susy had visibly waned. Often\r\nbefore, in the old days, Susy Branch had felt the same abrupt change of\r\ntemperature in the manner of the hostess of the moment; and often--how\r\noften--had yielded, and performed the required service, rather than risk\r\nthe consequences of estrangement. To that, at least, thank heaven, she\r\nneed never stoop again.\r\n\r\nBut as she hurriedly packed her trunks at Versailles, scraped together\r\nan adequate tip for Mrs. Match, and bade good-bye to Violet (grown\r\nsuddenly fond and demonstrative as she saw her visitor safely headed\r\nfor the station)--as Susy went through the old familiar mummery of the\r\nenforced leave-taking, there rose in her so deep a disgust for the\r\nlife of makeshifts and accommodations, that if at that moment Nick had\r\nreappeared and held out his arms to her, she was not sure she would have\r\nhad the courage to return to them.\r\n\r\nIn her London solitude the thirst for independence grew fiercer.\r\nIndependence with ease, of course. Oh, her hateful useless love of\r\nbeauty... the curse it had always been to her, the blessing it might\r\nhave been if only she had had the material means to gratify and to\r\nexpress it! And instead, it only gave her a morbid loathing of that\r\nhideous hotel bedroom drowned in yellow rain-light, of the smell of soot\r\nand cabbage through the window, the blistered wall-paper, the dusty wax\r\nbouquets under glass globes, and the electric lighting so contrived that\r\nas you turned on the feeble globe hanging from the middle of the ceiling\r\nthe feebler one beside the bed went out!\r\n\r\nWhat a sham world she and Nick had lived in during their few months\r\ntogether! What right had either of them to those exquisite settings\r\nof the life of leisure: the long white house hidden in camellias and\r\ncypresses above the lake, or the great rooms on the Giudecca with the\r\nshimmer of the canal always playing over their frescoed ceilings! Yet\r\nshe had come to imagine that these places really belonged to them, that\r\nthey would always go on living, fondly and irreproachably, in the frame\r\nof other people\xe2\x80\x99s wealth.... That, again, was the curse of her love of\r\nbeauty, the way she always took to it as if it belonged to her!\r\n\r\nWell, the awakening was bound to come, and it was perhaps better that\r\nit should have come so soon. At any rate there was no use in letting her\r\nthoughts wander back to that shattered fool\xe2\x80\x99s paradise of theirs. Only,\r\nas she sat there and reckoned up the days till Strefford arrived, what\r\nelse in the world was there to think of?\r\n\r\nHer future and his?\r\n\r\nBut she knew that future by heart already! She had not spent her life\r\namong the rich and fashionable without having learned every detail of\r\nthe trappings of a rich and fashionable marriage. She had calculated\r\nlong ago just how many dinner-dresses, how many tea-gowns and how much\r\nlacy lingerie would go to make up the outfit of the future Countess of\r\nAltringham. She had even decided to which dressmaker she would go for\r\nher chinchilla cloak--for she meant to have one, and down to her feet,\r\nand softer and more voluminous and more extravagantly sumptuous than\r\nViolet\xe2\x80\x99s or Ursula\xe2\x80\x99s... not to speak of silver foxes and sables... nor\r\nyet of the Altringham jewels.\r\n\r\nShe knew all this by heart; had always known it. It all belonged to the\r\nmake-up of the life of elegance: there was nothing new about it. What\r\nhad been new to her was just that short interval with Nick--a life\r\nunreal indeed in its setting, but so real in its essentials: the one\r\nreality she had ever known. As she looked back on it she saw how much\r\nit had given her besides the golden flush of her happiness, the sudden\r\nflowering of sensuous joy in heart and body. Yes--there had been the\r\nflowering too, in pain like birth-pangs, of something graver, stronger,\r\nfuller of future power, something she had hardly heeded in her first\r\nlight rapture, but that always came back and possessed her stilled soul\r\nwhen the rapture sank: the deep disquieting sense of something that\r\nNick and love had taught her, but that reached out even beyond love and\r\nbeyond Nick.\r\n\r\nHer nerves were racked by the ceaseless swish, swish of the rain on the\r\ndirty panes and the smell of cabbage and coal that came in under the\r\ndoor when she shut the window. This nauseating foretaste of the luncheon\r\nshe must presently go down to was more than she could bear. It brought\r\nwith it a vision of the dank coffee-room below, the sooty Smyrna rug,\r\nthe rain on the sky-light, the listless waitresses handing about food\r\nthat tasted as if it had been rained on too. There was really no reason\r\nwhy she should let such material miseries add to her depression....\r\n\r\nShe sprang up, put on her hat and jacket, and calling for a taxi drove\r\nto the London branch of the Nouveau Luxe hotel. It was just one o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nand she was sure to pick up a luncheon, for though London was empty\r\nthat great establishment was not. It never was. Along those sultry\r\nvelvet-carpeted halls, in that great flowered and scented dining-room,\r\nthere was always a come-and-go of rich aimless people, the busy people\r\nwho, having nothing to do, perpetually pursue their inexorable task from\r\none end of the earth to the other.\r\n\r\nOh, the monotony of those faces--the faces one always knew, whether one\r\nknew the people they belonged to or not! A fresh disgust seized her at\r\nthe sight of them: she wavered, and then turned and fled. But on the\r\nthreshold a still more familiar figure met her: that of a lady in\r\nexaggerated pearls and sables, descending from an exaggerated motor,\r\nlike the motors in magazine advertisements, the huge arks in which\r\njewelled beauties and slender youths pause to gaze at snowpeaks from an\r\nAlpine summit.\r\n\r\nIt was Ursula Gillow--dear old Ursula, on her way to Scotland--and she\r\nand Susy fell on each other\xe2\x80\x99s necks. It appeared that Ursula, detained\r\ntill the next evening by a dress-maker\xe2\x80\x99s delay, was also out of a job\r\nand killing time, and the two were soon smiling at each other over\r\nthe exquisite preliminaries of a luncheon which the head-waiter had\r\nauthoritatively asked Mrs. Gillow to \xe2\x80\x9cleave to him, as usual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUrsula was in a good humour. It did not often happen; but when it did\r\nher benevolence knew no bounds.\r\n\r\nLike Mrs. Melrose, like all her tribe in fact, she was too much absorbed\r\nin her own affairs to give more than a passing thought to any one\r\nelse\xe2\x80\x99s; but she was delighted at the meeting with Susy, as her wandering\r\nkind always were when they ran across fellow-wanderers, unless the\r\nmeeting happened to interfere with choicer pleasures. Not to be alone\r\nwas the urgent thing; and Ursula, who had been forty-eight hours alone\r\nin London, at once exacted from her friend a promise that they should\r\nspend the rest of the day together. But once the bargain struck her mind\r\nturned again to her own affairs, and she poured out her confidences\r\nto Susy over a succession of dishes that manifested the head-waiter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunderstanding of the case.\r\n\r\nUrsula\xe2\x80\x99s confidences were always the same, though they were usually\r\nabout a different person. She demolished and rebuilt her sentimental\r\nlife with the same frequency and impetuosity as that with which she\r\nchanged her dress-makers, did over her drawing-rooms, ordered new\r\nmotors, altered the mounting of her jewels, and generally renewed the\r\nsetting of her life. Susy knew in advance what the tale would be; but\r\nto listen to it over perfect coffee, an amber-scented cigarette at\r\nher lips, was pleasanter than consuming cold mutton alone in a mouldy\r\ncoffee-room. The contrast was so soothing that she even began to take a\r\nlanguid interest in her friend\xe2\x80\x99s narrative.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon they got into the motor together and began a systematic\r\nround of the West End shops: furriers, jewellers and dealers in old\r\nfurniture. Nothing could be more unlike Violet Melrose\xe2\x80\x99s long hesitating\r\nsessions before the things she thought she wanted till the moment came\r\nto decide. Ursula pounced on silver foxes and old lacquer as promptly\r\nand decisively as on the objects of her surplus sentimentality: she knew\r\nat once what she wanted, and valued it more after it was hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now--I wonder if you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help me choose a grand piano?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsuggested, as the last antiquarian bowed them out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA piano?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes: for Ruan. I\xe2\x80\x99m sending one down for Grace Fulmer. She\xe2\x80\x99s coming to\r\nstay... did I tell you? I want people to hear her. I want her to get\r\nengagements in London. My dear, she\xe2\x80\x99s a Genius.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Genius--Grace!\xe2\x80\x9d Susy gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was Nat....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat--Nat Fulmer?\xe2\x80\x9d Ursula laughed derisively. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, of course--you\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nstaying with that silly Violet! The poor thing is off her head about\r\nNat--it\xe2\x80\x99s really pitiful. Of course he has talent: I saw that long\r\nbefore Violet had ever heard of him. Why, on the opening day of the\r\nAmerican Artists\xe2\x80\x99 exhibition, last winter, I stopped short before his\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Spring Snow-Storm\xe2\x80\x99 (which nobody else had noticed till that moment),\r\nand said to the Prince, who was with me: \xe2\x80\x98The man has talent.\xe2\x80\x99 But\r\ngenius--why, it\xe2\x80\x99s his wife who has genius! Have you never heard Grace\r\nplay the violin? Poor Violet, as usual, is off on the wrong tack. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngiven Fulmer my garden-house to do--no doubt Violet told you--because\r\nI wanted to help him. But Grace is my discovery, and I\xe2\x80\x99m determined to\r\nmake her known, and to have every one understand that she is the genius\r\nof the two. I\xe2\x80\x99ve told her she simply must come to Ruan, and bring the\r\nbest accompanyist she can find. You know poor Nerone is dreadfully bored\r\nby sport, though of course he goes out with the guns. And if one didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave a little art in the evening.... Oh, Susy, do you mean to tell me\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to choose a piano? I thought you were so fond of\r\nmusic!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am fond of it; but without knowing anything about it--in the way\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re all of us fond of the worthwhile things in our stupid set,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she added to herself--since it was obviously useless to impart such\r\nreflections to Ursula.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut are you sure Grace is coming?\xe2\x80\x9d she questioned aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite sure. Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she? I wired to her yesterday. I\xe2\x80\x99m giving her\r\na thousand dollars and all her expenses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not till they were having tea in a Piccadilly tea-room that Mrs.\r\nGillow began to manifest some interest in her companion\xe2\x80\x99s plans. The\r\nthought of losing Susy became suddenly intolerable to her. The Prince,\r\nwho did not see why he should be expected to linger in London out of\r\nseason, was already at Ruan, and Ursula could not face the evening and\r\nthe whole of the next day by herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what are you doing in town, darling, I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember if I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, resting her firm elbows on the tea-table while she took\r\na light from Susy\xe2\x80\x99s cigarette.\r\n\r\nSusy hesitated. She had foreseen that the time must soon come when she\r\nshould have to give some account of herself; and why should she not\r\nbegin by telling Ursula?\r\n\r\nBut telling her what?\r\n\r\nHer silence appeared to strike Mrs. Gillow as a reproach, and she\r\ncontinued with compunction: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Nick? Nick\xe2\x80\x99s with you? How is he, I\r\nthought you and he still were in Venice with Ellie Vanderlyn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were, for a few weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d She steadied her voice. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was delightful.\r\nBut now we\xe2\x80\x99re both on our own again--for a while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Gillow scrutinized her more searchingly. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99re alone here,\r\nthen; quite alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes: Nick\xe2\x80\x99s cruising with some friends in the Mediterranean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUrsula\xe2\x80\x99s shallow gaze deepened singularly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, Susy darling, then if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re alone--and out of a job, just for the moment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but if you are, darling, and you would come to Ruan! I know Fred\r\nasked you didn\xe2\x80\x99t he? And he told me that both you and Nick had refused.\r\nHe was awfully huffed at your not coming; but I suppose that was because\r\nNick had other plans. We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have him now, because there\xe2\x80\x99s no room\r\nfor another gun; but since he\xe2\x80\x99s not here, and you\xe2\x80\x99re free, why you\r\nknow, dearest, don\xe2\x80\x99t you, how we\xe2\x80\x99d love to have you? Fred would be too\r\nglad--too outrageously glad--but you don\xe2\x80\x99t much mind Fred\xe2\x80\x99s love-making,\r\ndo you? And you\xe2\x80\x99d be such a help to me--if that\xe2\x80\x99s any argument! With\r\nthat big house full of men, and people flocking over every night to\r\ndine, and Fred caring only for sport, and Nerone simply loathing it and\r\nridiculing it, and not a minute to myself to try to keep him in a good\r\nhumour.... Oh, Susy darling, don\xe2\x80\x99t say no, but let me telephone at once\r\nfor a place in the train to-morrow night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy leaned back, letting the ash lengthen on her cigarette. How\r\nfamiliar, how hatefully familiar, was that old appeal! Ursula felt the\r\npressing need of someone to flirt with Fred for a few weeks... and here\r\nwas the very person she needed. Susy shivered at the thought. She had\r\nnever really meant to go to Ruan. She had simply used the moor as a\r\npretext when Violet Melrose had gently put her out of doors. Rather than\r\ndo what Ursula asked she would borrow a few hundred pounds of Strefford,\r\nas he had suggested, and then look about for some temporary occupation\r\nuntil--\r\n\r\nUntil she became Lady Altringham? Well, perhaps. At any rate, she was\r\nnot going back to slave for Ursula.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head with a faint smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry, Ursula: of course\r\nI want awfully to oblige you--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Gillow\xe2\x80\x99s gaze grew reproachful. \xe2\x80\x9cI should have supposed you would,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she murmured. Susy, meeting her eyes, looked into them down a long vista\r\nof favours bestowed, and perceived that Ursula was not the woman to\r\nforget on which side the obligation lay between them.\r\n\r\nSusy hesitated: she remembered the weeks of ecstasy she had owed to the\r\nGillows\xe2\x80\x99 wedding cheque, and it hurt her to appear ungrateful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could, Ursula... but really... I\xe2\x80\x99m not free at the moment.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\npaused, and then took an abrupt decision. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is, I\xe2\x80\x99m waiting here\r\nto see Strefford.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrefford\xe2\x80\x99 Lord Altringham?\xe2\x80\x9d Ursula stared. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes&mdash;I remember. You\r\nand he used to be great friends, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d Her roving attention\r\ndeepened.... But if Susy were waiting to see Lord Altringham--one of the\r\nrichest men in England! Suddenly Ursula opened her gold-meshed bag and\r\nsnatched a miniature diary from it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut wait a moment--yes, it is next week! I knew it was next week he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncoming to Ruan! But, you darling, that makes everything all right.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll send him a wire at once, and come with me to-morrow, and meet him\r\nthere instead of in this nasty sloppy desert.... Oh, Susy, if you knew\r\nhow hard life is for me in Scotland between the Prince and Fred you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly say no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy still wavered; but, after all, if Strefford were really bound\r\nfor Ruan, why not see him there, agreeably and at leisure, instead of\r\nspending a dreary day with him in roaming the wet London streets, or\r\nscreaming at him through the rattle of a restaurant orchestra? She knew\r\nhe would not be likely to postpone his visit to Ruan in order to linger\r\nin London with her: such concessions had never been his way, and were\r\nless than ever likely to be, now that he could do so thoroughly and\r\ncompletely as he pleased.\r\n\r\nFor the first time she fully understood how different his destiny had\r\nbecome. Now of course all his days and hours were mapped out in advance:\r\ninvitations assailed him, opportunities pressed on him, he had only to\r\nchoose.... And the women! She had never before thought of the women. All\r\nthe girls in England would be wanting to marry him, not to mention her\r\nown enterprising compatriots. And there were the married women, who were\r\neven more to be feared. Streff might, for the time, escape marriage;\r\nthough she could guess the power of persuasion, family pressure, all the\r\nconverging traditional influences he had so often ridiculed, yet, as\r\nshe knew, had never completely thrown off.... Yes, those quiet invisible\r\nwomen at Altringham--his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s widow, his mother, the spinster\r\nsisters--it was not impossible that, with tact and patience--and the\r\nstupidest women could be tactful and patient on such occasions--they\r\nmight eventually persuade him that it was his duty, they might put just\r\nthe right young loveliness in his way.... But meanwhile, now, at\r\nonce, there were the married women. Ah, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait, they were\r\ndoubtless laying their traps already! Susy shivered at the thought. She\r\nknew too much about the way the trick was done, had followed, too often,\r\nall the sinuosities of such approaches. Not that they were very sinuous\r\nnowadays: more often there was just a swoop and a pounce when the time\r\ncame; but she knew all the arts and the wiles that led up to it. She\r\nknew them, oh, how she knew them--though with Streff, thank heaven, she\r\nhad never been called upon to exercise them! His love was there for the\r\nasking: would she not be a fool to refuse it?\r\n\r\nPerhaps; though on that point her mind still wavered. But at any\r\nrate she saw that, decidedly, it would be better to yield to Ursula\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npressure; better to meet him at Ruan, in a congenial setting, where she\r\nwould have time to get her bearings, observe what dangers threatened\r\nhim, and make up her mind whether, after all, it was to be her mission\r\nto save him from the other women.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you like, then, Ursula....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you angel, you! I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad! We\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the nearest post office,\r\nand send off the wire ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs they got into the motor Mrs. Gillow seized Susy\xe2\x80\x99s arm with a pleading\r\npressure. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will let Fred make love to you a little, won\xe2\x80\x99t you,\r\ndarling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBUT I can\xe2\x80\x99t think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ellie Vanderlyn earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nannounce your engagement before waiting for your divorce. People are\r\nbeginning to do it, I assure you--it\xe2\x80\x99s so much safer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderlyn, on the way back from St. Moritz to England, had paused\r\nin Paris to renew the depleted wardrobe which, only two months earlier,\r\nhad filled so many trunks to bursting. Other ladies, flocking there\r\nfrom all points of the globe for the same purpose, disputed with her\r\nthe Louis XVI suites of the Nouveau Luxe, the pink-candled tables in\r\nthe restaurant, the hours for trying-on at the dressmakers\xe2\x80\x99; and just\r\nbecause they were so many, and all feverishly fighting to get the same\r\nthings at the same time, they were all excited, happy and at ease. It\r\nwas the most momentous period of the year: the height of the \xe2\x80\x9cdress\r\nmakers\xe2\x80\x99 season.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderlyn had run across Susy Lansing at one of the Rue de la Paix\r\nopenings, where rows of ladies wan with heat and emotion sat for hours\r\nin rapt attention while spectral apparitions in incredible raiment\r\ntottered endlessly past them on aching feet.\r\n\r\nDistracted from the regal splendours of a chinchilla cloak by the\r\nsense that another lady was also examining it, Mrs. Vanderlyn turned in\r\nsurprise at sight of Susy, whose head was critically bent above the fur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSusy! I\xe2\x80\x99d no idea you were here! I saw in the papers that you were with\r\nthe Gillows.\xe2\x80\x9d The customary embraces followed; then Mrs. Vanderlyn,\r\nher eyes pursuing the matchless cloak as it disappeared down a vista of\r\nreceding mannequins, interrogated sharply: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you shopping for Ursula?\r\nIf you mean to order that cloak for her I\xe2\x80\x99d rather know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy smiled, and paused a moment before answering. During the pause\r\nshe took in all the exquisite details of Ellie Vanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s perpetually\r\nyouthful person, from the plumed crown of her head to the perfect arch\r\nof her patent-leather shoes. At last she said quietly: \xe2\x80\x9cNo--to-day I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nshopping for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYourself? Yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Vanderlyn echoed with a stare of incredulity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; just for a change,\xe2\x80\x9d Susy serenely acknowledged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the cloak--I meant the chinchilla cloak... the one with the ermine\r\nlining....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; it is awfully good, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? But I mean to look elsewhere before\r\nI decide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAh, how often she had heard her friends use that phrase; and how amusing\r\nit was, now, to see Ellie\xe2\x80\x99s amazement as she heard it tossed off in\r\nher own tone of contemptuous satiety! Susy was becoming more and more\r\ndependent on such diversions; without them her days, crowded as they\r\nwere, would nevertheless have dragged by heavily. But it still amused\r\nher to go to the big dressmakers\xe2\x80\x99, watch the mannequins sweep by, and\r\nbe seen by her friends superciliously examining all the most expensive\r\ndresses in the procession. She knew the rumour was abroad that she and\r\nNick were to be divorced, and that Lord Altringham was \xe2\x80\x9cdevoted\xe2\x80\x9d to her.\r\nShe neither confirmed nor denied the report: she just let herself be\r\nluxuriously carried forward on its easy tide. But although it was now\r\nthree months since Nick had left the Palazzo Vanderlyn she had not yet\r\nwritten to him--nor he to her.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in spite of all that she packed into them, the days passed\r\nmore and more slowly, and the excitements she had counted on no longer\r\nexcited her. Strefford was hers: she knew that he would marry her as\r\nsoon as she was free. They had been together at Ruan for ten days, and\r\nafter that she had motored south with him, stopping on the way to see\r\nAltringham, from which, at the moment, his mourning relatives were\r\nabsent.\r\n\r\nAt Altringham they had parted; and after one or two more visits in\r\nEngland she had come back to Paris, where he was now about to join her.\r\nAfter her few hours at Altringham she had understood that he would wait\r\nfor her as long as was necessary: the fear of the \xe2\x80\x9cother women\xe2\x80\x9d had\r\nceased to trouble her. But, perhaps for that very reason, the future\r\nseemed less exciting than she had expected. Sometimes she thought it\r\nwas the sight of that great house which had overwhelmed her: it was\r\ntoo vast, too venerable, too like a huge monument built of ancient\r\nterritorial traditions and obligations. Perhaps it had been lived in for\r\ntoo long by too many serious-minded and conscientious women: somehow she\r\ncould not picture it invaded by bridge and debts and adultery. And yet\r\nthat was what would have to be, of course... she could hardly picture\r\neither Strefford or herself continuing there the life of heavy county\r\nresponsibilities, dull parties, laborious duties, weekly church-going,\r\nand presiding over local committees.... What a pity they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sell\r\nit and have a little house on the Thames!\r\n\r\nNevertheless she was not sorry to let it be known that Altringham was\r\nhers when she chose to take it. At times she wondered whether Nick\r\nknew... whether rumours had reached him. If they had, he had only his\r\nown letter to thank for it. He had told her what course to pursue; and\r\nshe was pursuing it.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the meeting with Ellie Vanderlyn had been a shock to her;\r\nshe had hoped never to see Ellie again. But now that they were actually\r\nface to face Susy perceived how dulled her sensibilities were. In a\r\nfew moments she had grown used to Ellie, as she was growing used to\r\neverybody and to everything in the old life she had returned to. What\r\nwas the use of making such a fuss about things? She and Mrs. Vanderlyn\r\nleft the dress-maker\xe2\x80\x99s together, and after an absorbing session at a new\r\nmilliner\xe2\x80\x99s were now taking tea in Ellie\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room at the Nouveau\r\nLuxe.\r\n\r\nEllie, with her spoiled child\xe2\x80\x99s persistency, had come back to the\r\nquestion of the chinchilla cloak. It was the only one she had seen that\r\nshe fancied in the very least, and as she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a decent fur garment\r\nleft to her name she was naturally in somewhat of a hurry... but, of\r\ncourse, if Susy had been choosing that model for a friend....\r\n\r\nSusy, leaning back against her cushions, examined through half-closed\r\nlids Mrs. Vanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s small delicately-restored countenance, which wore\r\nthe same expression of childish eagerness as when she discoursed of the\r\nyoung Davenant of the moment. Once again Susy remarked that, in Ellie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nagitated existence, every interest appeared to be on exactly the same\r\nplane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor shivering dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cof course it shall\r\nhave its nice warm winter cloak, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll choose another one instead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you darling, you! If you would! Of course, whoever you were\r\nordering it for need never know....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you can\xe2\x80\x99t comfort yourself with that, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid. I\xe2\x80\x99ve already told\r\nyou that I was ordering it for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d Susy paused to savour to the\r\nfull Ellie\xe2\x80\x99s look of blank bewilderment; then her amusement was checked\r\nby an indefinable change in her friend\xe2\x80\x99s expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dearest--seriously? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know there was someone....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy flushed to the forehead. A horror of humiliation overwhelmed her.\r\nThat Ellie should dare to think that of her--that anyone should dare to!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomeone buying chinchilla cloaks for me? Thanks!\xe2\x80\x9d she flared out. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsuppose I ought to be glad that the idea didn\xe2\x80\x99t immediately occur to\r\nyou. At least there was a decent interval of doubt....\xe2\x80\x9d She stood up,\r\nlaughing again, and began to wander about the room. In the mirror above\r\nthe mantel she caught sight of her flushed angry face, and of Mrs.\r\nVanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s disconcerted stare. She turned toward her friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose everybody else will think it if you do; so perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99d better\r\nexplain.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused, and drew a quick breath. \xe2\x80\x9cNick and I mean to\r\npart--have parted, in fact. He\xe2\x80\x99s decided that the whole thing was a\r\nmistake. He will probably; marry again soon--and so shall I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe flung the avowal out breathlessly, in her nervous dread of letting\r\nEllie Vanderlyn think for an instant longer that any other explanation\r\nwas conceivable. She had not meant to be so explicit; but once the words\r\nwere spoken she was not altogether sorry. Of course people would soon\r\nbegin to wonder why she was again straying about the world alone; and\r\nsince it was by Nick\xe2\x80\x99s choice, why should she not say so? Remembering\r\nthe burning anguish of those last hours in Venice she asked herself what\r\npossible consideration she owed to the man who had so humbled her.\r\n\r\nEllie Vanderlyn glanced at her in astonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cYou? You and Nick--are\r\ngoing to part?\xe2\x80\x9d A light appeared to dawn on her. \xe2\x80\x9cAh--then that\xe2\x80\x99s why he\r\nsent me back my pin, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour pin?\xe2\x80\x9d Susy wondered, not at once remembering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor little scarf-pin I gave him before I left Venice. He sent it\r\nback almost at once, with the oddest note--just: \xe2\x80\x98I haven\xe2\x80\x99t earned it,\r\nreally.\xe2\x80\x99 I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think why he didn\xe2\x80\x99t care for the pin. But, now I\r\nsuppose it was because you and he had quarrelled; though really, even\r\nso, I can\xe2\x80\x99t see why he should bear me a grudge....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy\xe2\x80\x99s quick blood surged up. Nick had sent back the pin--the fatal pin!\r\nAnd she, Susy, had kept the bracelet--locked it up out of sight, shrunk\r\naway from the little packet whenever her hand touched it in packing or\r\nunpacking--but never thought of returning it, no, not once! Which of the\r\ntwo, she wondered, had been right? Was it not an indirect slight to her\r\nthat Nick should fling back the gift to poor uncomprehending Ellie? Or\r\nwas it not rather another proof of his finer moral sensitiveness!...\r\nAnd how could one tell, in their bewildering world, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not because\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve quarrelled; we haven\xe2\x80\x99t quarrelled,\xe2\x80\x9d she said slowly, moved by the\r\nsudden desire to defend her privacy and Nick\xe2\x80\x99s, to screen from every\r\neye their last bitter hour together. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve simply decided that our\r\nexperiment was impossible--for two paupers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well--of course we all felt that at the time. And now somebody else\r\nwants to marry you! And it\xe2\x80\x99s your trousseau you were choosing that cloak\r\nfor?\xe2\x80\x9d Ellie cried in incredulous rapture; then she flung her arms about\r\nSusy\xe2\x80\x99s shrinking shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cYou lucky lucky girl! You clever clever\r\ndarling! But who on earth can he be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd it was then that Susy, for the first time, had pronounced the name\r\nof Lord Altringham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStreff--Streff? Our dear old Streff, You mean to say he wants to marry\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d As the news took possession of her mind Ellie became dithyrambic.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dearest, what a miracle of luck! Of course I always knew he\r\nwas awfully gone on you: Fred Davenant used to say so, I remember... and\r\neven Nelson, who\xe2\x80\x99s so stupid about such things, noticed it in Venice....\r\nBut then it was so different. No one could possibly have thought of\r\nmarrying him then; whereas now of course every woman is trying for him.\r\nOh, Susy, whatever you do, don\xe2\x80\x99t miss your chance! You can\xe2\x80\x99t conceive\r\nof the wicked plotting and intriguing there will be to get him--on all\r\nsides, and even where one least suspects it. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what horrors\r\nwomen will do--and even girls!\xe2\x80\x9d A shudder ran through her at the thought,\r\nand she caught Susy\xe2\x80\x99s wrists in vehement fingers. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t think,\r\nmy dear, why you don\xe2\x80\x99t announce your engagement at once. People are\r\nbeginning to do it, I assure you--it\xe2\x80\x99s so much safer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy looked at her, wondering. Not a word of sympathy for the ruin of\r\nher brief bliss, not even a gleam of curiosity as to its cause! No\r\ndoubt Ellie Vanderlyn, like all Susy\xe2\x80\x99s other friends, had long since\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdiscounted\xe2\x80\x9d the brevity of her dream, and perhaps planned a sequel to\r\nit before she herself had seen the glory fading. She and Nick had spent\r\nthe greater part of their few weeks together under Ellie Vanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroof; but to Ellie, obviously, the fact meant no more than her own\r\nescapade, at the same moment, with young Davenant\xe2\x80\x99s supplanter--the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbounder\xe2\x80\x9d whom Strefford had never named. Her one thought for her friend\r\nwas that Susy should at last secure her prize--her incredible prize. And\r\ntherein at any rate Ellie showed the kind of cold disinterestedness that\r\nraised her above the smiling perfidy of the majority of her kind. At\r\nleast her advice was sincere; and perhaps it was wise. Why should Susy\r\nnot let every one know that she meant to marry Strefford as soon as the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cformalities\xe2\x80\x9d were fulfilled?\r\n\r\nShe did not immediately answer Mrs. Vanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s question; and the\r\nlatter, repeating it, added impatiently: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you; if\r\nNick agrees--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he agrees,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what more do you want! Oh, Susy, if you\xe2\x80\x99d only follow my example!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour example?\xe2\x80\x9d Susy paused, weighed the word, was struck by something\r\nembarrassed, arch yet half-apologetic in her friend\xe2\x80\x99s expression. \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\nexample?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Ellie, what on earth do you mean? Not that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re going to part from poor Nelson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderlyn met her reproachful gaze with a crystalline glance. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to, heaven knows--poor dear Nelson! I assure you I simply\r\nhate it. He\xe2\x80\x99s always such an angel to Clarissa... and then we\xe2\x80\x99re used\r\nto each other. But what in the world am I to do? Algie\xe2\x80\x99s so rich, so\r\nappallingly rich, that I have to be perpetually on the watch to keep\r\nother women away from him--and it\xe2\x80\x99s too exhausting....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlgie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s lovely eyebrows rose. \xe2\x80\x9cAlgie: Algie Bockheimer. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou know, I think he said you\xe2\x80\x99ve dined with his parents. Nobody else in\r\nthe world is as rich as the Bockheimers; and Algie\xe2\x80\x99s their only\r\nchild. Yes, it was with him... with him I was so dreadfully happy last\r\nspring... and now I\xe2\x80\x99m in mortal terror of losing him. And I do assure\r\nyou there\xe2\x80\x99s no other way of keeping them, when they\xe2\x80\x99re as hideously rich\r\nas that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy rose to her feet. A little shudder ran over her. She remembered,\r\nnow, having seen Algie Bockheimer at one of his parents\xe2\x80\x99 first\r\nentertainments, in their newly-inaugurated marble halls in Fifth Avenue.\r\nShe recalled his too faultless clothes and his small glossy furtive\r\ncountenance. She looked at Ellie Vanderlyn with sudden scorn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99re abominable,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe other\xe2\x80\x99s perfect little face collapsed. \xe2\x80\x9cA-bo-minable? A-bo-mi-nable?\r\nSusy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes... with Nelson... and Clarissa... and your past together... and all\r\nthe money you can possibly want... and that man! Abominable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEllie stood up trembling: she was not used to scenes, and they\r\ndisarranged her thoughts as much as her complexion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re very cruel, Susy--so cruel and dreadful that I hardly know how\r\nto answer you,\xe2\x80\x9d she stammered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you simply don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ntalking about. As if anybody ever had all the money they wanted!\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nwiped her dark-rimmed eyes with a cautious handkerchief, glanced at\r\nherself in the mirror, and added magnanimously: \xe2\x80\x9cBut I shall try to\r\nforget what you\xe2\x80\x99ve said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUST such a revolt as she had felt as a girl, such a disgusted recoil\r\nfrom the standards and ideals of everybody about her as had flung her\r\ninto her mad marriage with Nick, now flamed in Susy Lansing\xe2\x80\x99s bosom.\r\n\r\nHow could she ever go back into that world again? How echo its\r\nappraisals of life and bow down to its judgments? Alas, it was only\r\nby marrying according to its standards that she could escape such\r\nsubjection. Perhaps the same thought had actuated Nick: perhaps he had\r\nunderstood sooner than she that to attain moral freedom they must both\r\nbe above material cares. Perhaps...\r\n\r\nHer talk with Ellie Vanderlyn had left Susy so oppressed and humiliated\r\nthat she almost shrank from her meeting with Altringham the next day.\r\nShe knew that he was coming to Paris for his final answer; he would wait\r\nas long as was necessary if only she would consent to take immediate\r\nsteps for a divorce. She was staying at a modest hotel in the Faubourg\r\nSt. Germain, and had once more refused his suggestion that they should\r\nlunch at the Nouveau Luxe, or at some fashionable restaurant of the\r\nBoulevards. As before, she insisted on going to an out-of-the-way place\r\nnear the Luxembourg, where the prices were moderate enough for her own\r\npurse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d Strefford objected, as they turned from her hotel\r\ndoor toward this obscure retreat, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy you insist on giving me bad food,\r\nand depriving me of the satisfaction of being seen with you. Why must we\r\nbe so dreadfully clandestine? Don\xe2\x80\x99t people know by this time that we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nto be married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy winced a little: she wondered if the word would always sound so\r\nunnatural on his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cthey simply think, for the present, that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re giving me pearls and chinchilla cloaks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wrinkled his brows good-humouredly. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, so I would, with joy--at\r\nthis particular minute. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d better take\r\nadvantage of it? I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to insist--but I foresee that I\xe2\x80\x99m much too\r\nrich not to become stingy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave a slight shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cAt present there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing I loathe more than\r\npearls and chinchilla, or anything else in the world that\xe2\x80\x99s expensive\r\nand enviable....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly she broke off, colouring with the consciousness that she had\r\nsaid exactly the kind of thing that all the women who were trying for\r\nhim (except the very cleverest) would be sure to say; and that he\r\nwould certainly suspect her of attempting the conventional comedy of\r\ndisinterestedness, than which nothing was less likely to deceive or to\r\nflatter him.\r\n\r\nHis twinkling eyes played curiously over her face, and she went on,\r\nmeeting them with a smile: \xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t imagine, all the same, that if I\r\nshould... decide... it would be altogether for your beaux yeux....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed, she thought, rather drily. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s ever likely to happen to me again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Streff--\xe2\x80\x9d she faltered with compunction. It was odd--once upon a\r\ntime she had known exactly what to say to the man of the moment, whoever\r\nhe was, and whatever kind of talk he required; she had even, in the\r\ndifficult days before her marriage, reeled off glibly enough the sort\r\nof lime-light sentimentality that plunged poor Fred Gillow into such\r\nspeechless beatitude. But since then she had spoken the language of real\r\nlove, looked with its eyes, embraced with its hands; and now the other\r\ntrumpery art had failed her, and she was conscious of bungling and\r\ngroping like a beginner under Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s ironic scrutiny.\r\n\r\nThey had reached their obscure destination and he opened the door and\r\nglanced in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s jammed--not a table. And stifling! Where shall we go? Perhaps they\r\ncould give us a room to ourselves--\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested.\r\n\r\nShe assented, and they were led up a cork-screw staircase to a\r\nsquat-ceilinged closet lit by the arched top of a high window, the lower\r\npanes of which served for the floor below. Strefford opened the window,\r\nand Susy, throwing her cloak on the divan, leaned on the balcony while\r\nhe ordered luncheon.\r\n\r\nOn the whole she was glad they were to be alone. Just because she\r\nfelt so sure of Strefford it seemed ungenerous to keep him longer in\r\nsuspense. The moment had come when they must have a decisive talk, and\r\nin the crowded rooms below it would have been impossible.\r\n\r\nStrefford, when the waiter had brought the first course and left them\r\nto themselves, made no effort to revert to personal matters. He turned\r\ninstead to the topic always most congenial to him: the humours and\r\nironies of the human comedy, as presented by his own particular group.\r\nHis malicious commentary on life had always amused Susy because of the\r\nshrewd flashes of philosophy he shed on the social antics they had\r\nso often watched together. He was in fact the one person she knew\r\n(excepting Nick) who was in the show and yet outside of it; and she was\r\nsurprised, as the talk proceeded, to find herself so little interested\r\nin his scraps of gossip, and so little amused by his comments on them.\r\n\r\nWith an inward shrug of discouragement she said to herself that probably\r\nnothing would ever really amuse her again; then, as she listened, she\r\nbegan to understand that her disappointment arose from the fact that\r\nStrefford, in reality, could not live without these people whom he\r\nsaw through and satirized, and that the rather commonplace scandals he\r\nnarrated interested him as much as his own racy considerations on them;\r\nand she was filled with terror at the thought that the inmost core of\r\nthe richly-decorated life of the Countess of Altringham would be just\r\nas poor and low-ceilinged a place as the little room in which he and she\r\nnow sat, elbow to elbow yet so unapproachably apart.\r\n\r\nIf Strefford could not live without these people, neither could she and\r\nNick; but for reasons how different! And if his opportunities had\r\nbeen theirs, what a world they would have created for themselves! Such\r\nimaginings were vain, and she shrank back from them into the present.\r\nAfter all, as Lady Altringham she would have the power to create that\r\nworld which she and Nick had dreamed... only she must create it alone.\r\nWell, that was probably the law of things. All human happiness was thus\r\nconditioned and circumscribed, and hers, no doubt, must always be of the\r\nlonely kind, since material things did not suffice for it, even though\r\nit depended on them as Grace Fulmer\xe2\x80\x99s, for instance, never had. Yet even\r\nGrace Fulmer had succumbed to Ursula\xe2\x80\x99s offer, and had arrived at Ruan\r\nthe day before Susy left, instead of going to Spain with her husband\r\nand Violet Melrose. But then Grace was making the sacrifice for her\r\nchildren, and somehow one had the feeling that in giving up her liberty\r\nshe was not surrendering a tittle of herself. All the difference was\r\nthere....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow I do bore you!\xe2\x80\x9d Susy heard Strefford exclaim. She became aware\r\nthat she had not been listening: stray echoes of names of places and\r\npeople--Violet Melrose, Ursula, Prince Altineri, others of their group\r\nand persuasion--had vainly knocked at her barricaded brain; what had he\r\nbeen telling her about them? She turned to him and their eyes met; his\r\nwere full of a melancholy irony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSusy, old girl, what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pulled herself together. \xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking, Streff, just now--when I\r\nsaid I hated the very sound of pearls and chinchilla--how impossible\r\nit was that you should believe me; in fact, what a blunder I\xe2\x80\x99d made in\r\nsaying it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause it was what so many other women might be likely to\r\nsay so awfully unoriginal, in fact?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed for sheer joy at his insight. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to be easier than\r\nI imagined,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. Aloud she rejoined: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Streff--how you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nalways going to find me out! Where on earth shall I ever hide from you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d He echoed her laugh, laying his hand lightly on hers. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my\r\nheart, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of the laugh his accent shook her: something about it took\r\nall the mockery from his retort, checked on her lips the: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat? A\r\nvalentine!\xe2\x80\x9d and made her suddenly feel that, if he were afraid, so was\r\nshe. Yet she was touched also, and wondered half exultingly if any\r\nother woman had ever caught that particular deep inflexion of his shrill\r\nvoice. She had never liked him as much as at that moment; and she said\r\nto herself, with an odd sense of detachment, as if she had been rather\r\nbreathlessly observing the vacillations of someone whom she longed to\r\npersuade but dared not: \xe2\x80\x9cNow--NOW, if he speaks, I shall say yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not speak; but abruptly, and as startlingly to her as if she\r\nhad just dropped from a sphere whose inhabitants had other methods of\r\nexpressing their sympathy, he slipped his arm around her and bent his\r\nkeen ugly melting face to hers....\r\n\r\nIt was the lightest touch--in an instant she was free again. But\r\nsomething within her gasped and resisted long after his arm and his lips\r\nwere gone, and he was proceeding, with a too-studied ease, to light a\r\ncigarette and sweeten his coffee.\r\n\r\nHe had kissed her.... Well, naturally: why not? It was not the first\r\ntime she had been kissed. It was true that one didn\xe2\x80\x99t habitually\r\nassociate Streff with such demonstrations; but she had not that excuse\r\nfor surprise, for even in Venice she had begun to notice that he looked\r\nat her differently, and avoided her hand when he used to seek it.\r\n\r\nNo--she ought not to have been surprised; nor ought a kiss to have been\r\nso disturbing. Such incidents had punctuated the career of Susy Branch:\r\nthere had been, in particular, in far-off discarded times, Fred Gillow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlarge but artless embraces. Well--nothing of that kind had seemed of\r\nany more account than the click of a leaf in a woodland walk. It had\r\nall been merely epidermal, ephemeral, part of the trivial accepted\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbusiness\xe2\x80\x9d of the social comedy. But this kiss of Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s was what\r\nNick\xe2\x80\x99s had been, under the New Hampshire pines, on the day that had\r\ndecided their fate. It was a kiss with a future in it: like a\r\nring slipped upon her soul. And now, in the dreadful pause that\r\nfollowed--while Strefford fidgeted with his cigarette-case and rattled\r\nthe spoon in his cup, Susy remembered what she had seen through the\r\ncircle of Nick\xe2\x80\x99s kiss: that blue illimitable distance which was at once\r\nthe landscape at their feet and the future in their souls....\r\n\r\nPerhaps that was what Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s sharply narrowed eyes were seeing now,\r\nthat same illimitable distance that she had lost forever--perhaps he was\r\nsaying to himself, as she had said to herself when her lips left Nick\xe2\x80\x99s:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEach time we kiss we shall see it all again....\xe2\x80\x9d Whereas all she\r\nherself had felt was the gasping recoil from Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s touch, and an\r\nintenser vision of the sordid room in which he and she sat, and of their\r\ntwo selves, more distant from each other than if their embrace had been\r\na sudden thrusting apart....\r\n\r\nThe moment prolonged itself, and they sat numb. How long had it lasted?\r\nHow long ago was it that she had thought: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to be easier than\r\nI imagined\xe2\x80\x9d? Suddenly she felt Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s queer smile upon her, and saw\r\nin his eyes a look, not of reproach or disappointment, but of deep and\r\nanxious comprehension. Instead of being angry or hurt, he had seen, he\r\nhad understood, he was sorry for her!\r\n\r\nImpulsively she slipped her hand into his, and they sat silent for\r\nanother moment. Then he stood up and took her cloak from the divan.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we go now! I\xe2\x80\x99ve got cards for the private view of the Reynolds\r\nexhibition at the Petit Palais. There are some portraits from\r\nAltringham. It might amuse you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the taxi she had time, through their light rattle of talk, to\r\nreadjust herself and drop back into her usual feeling of friendly ease\r\nwith him. He had been extraordinarily considerate, for anyone who always\r\nso undisguisedly sought his own satisfaction above all things; and\r\nif his considerateness were just an indirect way of seeking that\r\nsatisfaction now, well, that proved how much he cared for her, how\r\nnecessary to his happiness she had become. The sense of power was\r\nundeniably pleasant; pleasanter still was the feeling that someone\r\nreally needed her, that the happiness of the man at her side depended\r\non her yes or no. She abandoned herself to the feeling, forgetting the\r\nabysmal interval of his caress, or at least saying to herself that in\r\ntime she would forget it, that really there was nothing to make a fuss\r\nabout in being kissed by anyone she liked as much as Streff....\r\n\r\nShe had guessed at once why he was taking her to see the Reynoldses.\r\nFashionable and artistic Paris had recently discovered English\r\neighteenth century art. The principal collections of England had yielded\r\nup their best examples of the great portrait painter\xe2\x80\x99s work, and the\r\nprivate view at the Petit Palais was to be the social event of the\r\nafternoon. Everybody--Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s everybody and Susy\xe2\x80\x99s--was sure to\r\nbe there; and these, as she knew, were the occasions that revived\r\nStrefford\xe2\x80\x99s intermittent interest in art. He really liked picture shows\r\nas much as the races, if one could be sure of seeing as many people\r\nthere. With Nick how different it would have been! Nick hated openings\r\nand varnishing days, and worldly aesthetics in general; he would have\r\nwaited till the tide of fashion had ebbed, and slipped off with Susy to\r\nsee the pictures some morning when they were sure to have the place to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nBut Susy divined that there was another reason for Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuggestion. She had never yet shown herself with him publicly, among\r\ntheir own group of people: now he had determined that she should do\r\nso, and she knew why. She had humbled his pride; he had understood, and\r\nforgiven her. But she still continued to treat him as she had always\r\ntreated the Strefford of old, Charlie Strefford, dear old negligible\r\nimpecunious Streff; and he wanted to show her, ever so casually and\r\nadroitly, that the man who had asked her to marry him was no longer\r\nStrefford, but Lord Altringham.\r\n\r\nAt the very threshold, his Ambassador\xe2\x80\x99s greeting marked the difference:\r\nit was followed, wherever they turned, by ejaculations of welcome from\r\nthe rulers of the world they moved in. Everybody rich enough or titled\r\nenough, or clever enough or stupid enough, to have forced a way into the\r\nsocial citadel, was there, waving and flag-flying from the battlements;\r\nand to all of them Lord Altringham had become a marked figure. During\r\ntheir slow progress through the dense mass of important people who made\r\nthe approach to the pictures so well worth fighting for, he never left\r\nSusy\xe2\x80\x99s side, or failed to make her feel herself a part of his triumphal\r\nadvance. She heard her name mentioned: \xe2\x80\x9cLansing--a Mrs. Lansing--an\r\nAmerican... Susy Lansing? Yes, of course.... You remember her? At\r\nNewport, At St. Moritz? Exactly.... Divorced already? They say so...\r\nSusy darling! I\xe2\x80\x99d no idea you were here... and Lord Altringham! You\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nforgotten me, I know, Lord Altringham.... Yes, last year, in Cairo... or\r\nat Newport... or in Scotland ... Susy, dearest, when will you bring Lord\r\nAltringham to dine? Any night that you and he are free I\xe2\x80\x99ll arrange to\r\nbe....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou and he\xe2\x80\x9d: they were \xe2\x80\x9cyou and he\xe2\x80\x9d already!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there\xe2\x80\x99s one of them--of my great-grandmothers,\xe2\x80\x9d Strefford\r\nexplained, giving a last push that drew him and Susy to the front rank,\r\nbefore a tall isolated portrait which, by sheer majesty of presentment,\r\nsat in its great carved golden frame as on a throne above the other\r\npictures.\r\n\r\nSusy read on the scroll beneath it: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hon\xe2\x80\x99ble Diana Lefanu, fifteenth\r\nCountess of Altringham\xe2\x80\x9d--and heard Strefford say: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember? It\r\nhangs where you noticed the empty space above the mantel-piece, in the\r\nVandyke room. They say Reynolds stipulated that it should be put with\r\nthe Vandykes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had never before heard him speak of his possessions, whether\r\nancestral or merely material, in just that full and satisfied tone of\r\nvoice: the rich man\xe2\x80\x99s voice. She saw that he was already feeling the\r\ninfluence of his surroundings, that he was glad the portrait of a\r\nCountess of Altringham should occupy the central place in the principal\r\nroom of the exhibition, that the crowd about it should be denser there\r\nthan before any of the other pictures, and that he should be standing\r\nthere with Susy, letting her feel, and letting all the people about\r\nthem guess, that the day she chose she could wear the same name as his\r\npictured ancestress.\r\n\r\nOn the way back to her hotel, Strefford made no farther allusion to\r\ntheir future; they chatted like old comrades in their respective corners\r\nof the taxi. But as the carriage stopped at her door he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI must go\r\nback to England the day after to-morrow, worse luck! Why not dine with\r\nme to-night at the Nouveau Luxe? I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have the Ambassador and\r\nLady Ascot, with their youngest girl and my old Dunes aunt, the Dowager\r\nDuchess, who\xe2\x80\x99s over here hiding from her creditors; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get\r\ntwo or three amusing men to leaven the lump. We might go on to a boite\r\nafterward, if you\xe2\x80\x99re bored. Unless the dancing amuses you more....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe understood that he had decided to hasten his departure rather than\r\nlinger on in uncertainty; she also remembered having heard the Ascots\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyoungest daughter, Lady Joan Senechal, spoken of as one of the prettiest\r\ngirls of the season; and she recalled the almost exaggerated warmth of\r\nthe Ambassador\xe2\x80\x99s greeting at the private view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I\xe2\x80\x99ll come, Streff dear!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, with an effort at gaiety\r\nthat sounded successful to her own strained ears, and reflected itself\r\nin the sudden lighting up of his face.\r\n\r\nShe waved a good-bye from the step, saying to herself, as she looked\r\nafter him: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll drive me home to-night, and I shall say \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99; and\r\nthen he\xe2\x80\x99ll kiss me again. But the next time it won\xe2\x80\x99t be nearly as\r\ndisagreeable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned into the hotel, glanced automatically at the empty\r\npigeon-hole for letters under her key-hook, and mounted the stairs\r\nfollowing the same train of images. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I shall say \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99 to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she repeated firmly, her hand on the door of her room. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is, unless,\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve brought up a letter....\xe2\x80\x9d She never re-entered the hotel without\r\nimagining that the letter she had not found below had already been\r\nbrought up.\r\n\r\nOpening the door, she turned on the light and sprang to the table on\r\nwhich her correspondence sometimes awaited her.\r\n\r\nThere was no letter; but the morning papers, still unread, lay at hand,\r\nand glancing listlessly down the column which chronicles the doings of\r\nsociety, she read:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter an extended cruise in the AEgean and the Black Sea on their\r\nsteam-yacht Ibis, Mr. and Mrs. Mortimer Hicks and their daughter are\r\nestablished at the Nouveau Luxe in Rome. They have lately had the honour\r\nof entertaining at dinner the Reigning Prince of Teutoburger-Waldhain\r\nand his mother the Princess Dowager, with their suite. Among those\r\ninvited to meet their Serene Highnesses were the French and Spanish\r\nAmbassadors, the Duchesse de Vichy, Prince and Princess Bagnidilucca,\r\nLady Penelope Pantiles--\xe2\x80\x9d Susy\xe2\x80\x99s eye flew impatiently on over the long\r\nlist of titles--\xe2\x80\x9cand Mr. Nicholas Lansing of New York, who has been\r\ncruising with Mr. and Mrs. Hicks on the Ibis for the last few months.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Mortimer Hickses were in Rome; not, as they would in former times\r\nhave been, in one of the antiquated hostelries of the Piazza di Spagna\r\nor the Porta del Popolo, where of old they had so gaily defied fever\r\nand nourished themselves on local colour; but spread out, with all the\r\nostentation of philistine millionaires, under the piano nobile ceilings\r\nof one of the high-perched \xe2\x80\x9cPalaces,\xe2\x80\x9d where, as Mrs. Hicks shamelessly\r\ndeclared, they could \xe2\x80\x9crely on the plumbing,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chave the privilege of\r\nover-looking the Queen Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Gardens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was that speech, uttered with beaming aplomb at a dinner-table\r\nsurrounded by the cosmopolitan nobility of the Eternal City, that had\r\nsuddenly revealed to Lansing the profound change in the Hicks point of\r\nview.\r\n\r\nAs he looked back over the four months since he had so unexpectedly\r\njoined the Ibis at Genoa, he saw that the change, at first insidious\r\nand unperceived, dated from the ill-fated day when the Hickses had run\r\nacross a Reigning Prince on his travels.\r\n\r\nHitherto they had been proof against such perils: both Mr. and Mrs.\r\nHicks had often declared that the aristocracy of the intellect was the\r\nonly one which attracted them. But in this case the Prince possessed an\r\nintellect, in addition to his few square miles of territory, and to one\r\nof the most beautiful Field Marshal\xe2\x80\x99s uniforms that had ever encased a\r\nroyal warrior. The Prince was not a warrior, however; he was stooping,\r\npacific and spectacled, and his possession of the uniform had been\r\nrevealed to Mrs. Hicks only by the gift of a full-length photograph in\r\na Bond Street frame, with Anastasius written slantingly across its\r\nlegs. The Prince--and herein lay the Hickses\xe2\x80\x99 undoing--the Prince was\r\nan archaeologist: an earnest anxious enquiring and scrupulous\r\narchaeologist. Delicate health (so his suite hinted) banished him for\r\na part of each year from his cold and foggy principality; and in the\r\ncompany of his mother, the active and enthusiastic Dowager Princess, he\r\nwandered from one Mediterranean shore to another, now assisting at\r\nthe exhumation of Ptolemaic mummies, now at the excavation of Delphic\r\ntemples or of North African basilicas. The beginning of winter usually\r\nbrought the Prince and his mother to Rome or Nice, unless indeed they\r\nwere summoned by family duties to Berlin, Vienna or Madrid; for an\r\nextended connection with the principal royal houses of Europe compelled\r\nthem, as the Princess Mother said, to be always burying or marrying a\r\ncousin. At other moments they were seldom seen in the glacial atmosphere\r\nof courts, preferring to royal palaces those of the other, and more\r\nmodern type, in one of which the Hickses were now lodged.\r\n\r\nYes: the Prince and his mother (they gaily avowed it) revelled in Palace\r\nHotels; and, being unable to afford the luxury of inhabiting them,\r\nthey liked, as often as possible, to be invited to dine there by their\r\nfriends--\xe2\x80\x9cor even to tea, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d the Princess laughingly avowed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor I\xe2\x80\x99m so awfully fond of buttered scones; and Anastasius gives me so\r\nlittle to eat in the desert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe encounter with these ambulant Highnesses had been fatal--Lansing\r\nnow perceived it--to Mrs. Hicks\xe2\x80\x99s principles. She had known a great many\r\narchaeologists, but never one as agreeable as the Prince, and above\r\nall never one who had left a throne to camp in the desert and delve in\r\nLibyan tombs. And it seemed to her infinitely pathetic that these two\r\ngifted beings, who grumbled when they had to go to \xe2\x80\x9cmarry a cousin\xe2\x80\x9d at\r\nthe Palace of St. James or of Madrid, and hastened back breathlessly to\r\nthe far-off point where, metaphorically speaking, pick-axe and spade had\r\ndropped from their royal hands--that these heirs of the ages should be\r\nunable to offer themselves the comforts of up-to-date hotel life, and\r\nshould enjoy themselves \xe2\x80\x9clike babies\xe2\x80\x9d when they were invited to the\r\nother kind of \xe2\x80\x9cPalace,\xe2\x80\x9d to feast on buttered scones and watch the tango.\r\n\r\nShe simply could not bear the thought of their privations; and neither,\r\nafter a time, could Mr. Hicks, who found the Prince more democratic than\r\nanyone he had ever known at Apex City, and was immensely interested by\r\nthe fact that their spectacles came from the same optician.\r\n\r\nBut it was, above all, the artistic tendencies of the Prince and his\r\nmother which had conquered the Hickses. There was fascination in the\r\nthought that, among the rabble of vulgar uneducated royalties who\r\noverran Europe from Biarritz to the Engadine, gambling, tangoing,\r\nand sponging on no less vulgar plebeians, they, the unobtrusive\r\nand self-respecting Hickses, should have had the luck to meet this\r\ncultivated pair, who joined them in gentle ridicule of their own\r\nfrivolous kinsfolk, and whose tastes were exactly those of the\r\neccentric, unreliable and sometimes money-borrowing persons who had\r\nhitherto represented the higher life to the Hickses.\r\n\r\nNow at last Mrs. Hicks saw the possibility of being at once artistic and\r\nluxurious, of surrendering herself to the joys of modern plumbing and\r\nyet keeping the talk on the highest level. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the poor dear Princess\r\nwants to dine at the Nouveau Luxe why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we give her that\r\npleasure?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Hicks smilingly enquired; \xe2\x80\x9cand as for enjoying her\r\nbuttered scones like a baby, as she says, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s the sweetest\r\nthing about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCoral Hicks did not join in this chorus; but she accepted, with her\r\ncurious air of impartiality, the change in her parents\xe2\x80\x99 manner of life,\r\nand for the first time (as Nick observed) occupied herself with her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s toilet, with the result that Mrs. Hicks\xe2\x80\x99s outline became\r\nfirmer, her garments soberer in hue and finer in material; so that,\r\nshould anyone chance to detect the daughter\xe2\x80\x99s likeness to her mother,\r\nthe result was less likely to be disturbing.\r\n\r\nSuch precautions were the more needful--Lansing could not but note\r\nbecause of the different standards of the society in which the Hickses\r\nnow moved. For it was a curious fact that admission to the intimacy of\r\nthe Prince and his mother--who continually declared themselves to be\r\nthe pariahs, the outlaws, the Bohemians among crowned heads nevertheless\r\ninvolved not only living in Palace Hotels but mixing with those who\r\nfrequented them. The Prince\xe2\x80\x99s aide-de-camp--an agreeable young man of\r\neasy manners--had smilingly hinted that their Serene Highnesses, though\r\nso thoroughly democratic and unceremonious, were yet accustomed to\r\ninspecting in advance the names of the persons whom their hosts wished\r\nto invite with them; and Lansing noticed that Mrs. Hicks\xe2\x80\x99s lists,\r\nhaving been \xe2\x80\x9csubmitted,\xe2\x80\x9d usually came back lengthened by the addition of\r\nnumerous wealthy and titled guests. Their Highnesses never struck out\r\na name; they welcomed with enthusiasm and curiosity the Hickses\xe2\x80\x99 oddest\r\nand most inexplicable friends, at most putting off some of them to a\r\nlater day on the plea that it would be \xe2\x80\x9ccosier\xe2\x80\x9d to meet them on a more\r\nprivate occasion; but they invariably added to the list any friends of\r\ntheir own, with the gracious hint that they wished these latter (though\r\nsocially so well-provided for) to have the \xe2\x80\x9cimmense privilege\xe2\x80\x9d of\r\nknowing the Hickses. And thus it happened that when October gales\r\nnecessitated laying up the Ibis, the Hickses, finding again in Rome\r\nthe august travellers from whom they had parted the previous month in\r\nAthens, also found their visiting-list enlarged by all that the capital\r\ncontained of fashion.\r\n\r\nIt was true enough, as Lansing had not failed to note, that the Princess\r\nMother adored prehistoric art, and Russian music, and the paintings of\r\nGauguin and Matisse; but she also, and with a beaming unconsciousness\r\nof perspective, adored large pearls and powerful motors, caravan tea and\r\nmodern plumbing, perfumed cigarettes and society scandals; and her son,\r\nwhile apparently less sensible to these forms of luxury, adored his\r\nmother, and was charmed to gratify her inclinations without cost to\r\nhimself--\xe2\x80\x9cSince poor Mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d as he observed, \xe2\x80\x9cis so courageous when we\r\nare roughing it in the desert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe smiling aide-de-camp, who explained these things to Lansing,\r\nadded with an intenser smile that the Prince and his mother were under\r\nobligations, either social or cousinly, to most of the titled persons\r\nwhom they begged Mrs. Hicks to invite; \xe2\x80\x9cand it seems to their Serene\r\nHighnesses,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cthe most flattering return they can make for\r\nthe hospitality of their friends to give them such an intellectual\r\nopportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dinner-table at which their Highnesses\xe2\x80\x99 friends were seated on\r\nthe evening in question represented, numerically, one of the greatest\r\nintellectual opportunities yet afforded them. Thirty guests were grouped\r\nabout the flower-wreathed board, from which Eldorada and Mr. Beck had\r\nbeen excluded on the plea that the Princess Mother liked cosy parties\r\nand begged her hosts that there should never be more than thirty\r\nat table. Such, at least, was the reason given by Mrs. Hicks to her\r\nfaithful followers; but Lansing had observed that, of late, the same\r\nskilled hand which had refashioned the Hickses\xe2\x80\x99 social circle usually\r\nmanaged to exclude from it the timid presences of the two secretaries.\r\nTheir banishment was the more displeasing to Lansing from the fact that,\r\nfor the last three months, he had filled Mr. Buttles\xe2\x80\x99s place, and was\r\nhimself their salaried companion. But since he had accepted the post,\r\nhis obvious duty was to fill it in accordance with his employers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nrequirements; and it was clear even to Eldorada and Mr. Beck that\r\nhe had, as Eldorada ungrudgingly said, \xe2\x80\x9cSomething of Mr. Buttles\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmarvellous social gifts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring the cruise his task had not been distasteful to him. He was glad\r\nof any definite duties, however trivial, he felt more independent as the\r\nHickses\xe2\x80\x99 secretary than as their pampered guest, and the large cheque\r\nwhich Mr. Hicks handed over to him on the first of each month refreshed\r\nhis languishing sense of self-respect.\r\n\r\nHe considered himself absurdly over-paid, but that was the Hickses\xe2\x80\x99\r\naffair; and he saw nothing humiliating in being in the employ of people\r\nhe liked and respected. But from the moment of the ill-fated encounter\r\nwith the wandering Princes, his position had changed as much as that\r\nof his employers. He was no longer, to Mr. and Mrs. Hicks, a useful and\r\nestimable assistant, on the same level as Eldorada and Mr. Beck; he had\r\nbecome a social asset of unsuspected value, equalling Mr. Buttles in\r\nhis capacity for dealing with the mysteries of foreign etiquette, and\r\nsurpassing him in the art of personal attraction. Nick Lansing, the\r\nHickses found, already knew most of the Princess Mother\xe2\x80\x99s rich and\r\naristocratic friends. Many of them hailed him with enthusiastic \xe2\x80\x9cOld\r\nNicks\xe2\x80\x9d, and he was almost as familiar as His Highness\xe2\x80\x99s own aide-de-camp\r\nwith all those secret ramifications of love and hate that made\r\ndinner-giving so much more of a science in Rome than at Apex City.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hicks, at first, had hopelessly lost her way in this labyrinth of\r\nsubterranean scandals, rivalries and jealousies; and finding Lansing\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand within reach she clung to it with pathetic tenacity. But if\r\nthe young man\xe2\x80\x99s value had risen in the eyes of his employers it had\r\ndeteriorated in his own. He was condemned to play a part he had\r\nnot bargained for, and it seemed to him more degrading when paid in\r\nbank-notes than if his retribution had consisted merely in good dinners\r\nand luxurious lodgings. The first time the smiling aide-de-camp had\r\ncaught his eye over a verbal slip of Mrs. Hicks\xe2\x80\x99s, Nick had flushed to\r\nthe forehead and gone to bed swearing that he would chuck his job the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nTwo months had passed since then, and he was still the paid secretary.\r\nHe had contrived to let the aide-de-camp feel that he was too deficient\r\nin humour to be worth exchanging glances with; but even this had not\r\nrestored his self-respect, and on the evening in question, as he looked\r\nabout the long table, he said to himself for the hundredth time that he\r\nwould give up his position on the morrow.\r\n\r\nOnly--what was the alternative? The alternative, apparently, was Coral\r\nHicks. He glanced down the line of diners, beginning with the tall lean\r\ncountenance of the Princess Mother, with its small inquisitive eyes\r\nperched as high as attic windows under a frizzled thatch of hair and a\r\npediment of uncleaned diamonds; passed on to the vacuous and overfed\r\nor fashionably haggard masks of the ladies next in rank; and finally\r\ncaught, between branching orchids, a distant glimpse of Miss Hicks.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with the others, he thought, she looked surprisingly noble.\r\nHer large grave features made her appear like an old monument in a\r\nstreet of Palace Hotels; and he marvelled at the mysterious law which\r\nhad brought this archaic face out of Apex City, and given to the oldest\r\nsociety of Europe a look of such mixed modernity.\r\n\r\nLansing perceived that the aide-de-camp, who was his neighbour, was also\r\nlooking at Miss Hicks. His expression was serious, and even thoughtful;\r\nbut as his eyes met Lansing\xe2\x80\x99s he readjusted his official smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was admiring our hostess\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. Her absence of jewels is--er--an\r\ninspiration,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked in the confidential tone which Lansing had\r\ncome to dread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Miss Hicks is full of inspirations,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned curtly, and the\r\naide-de-camp bowed with an admiring air, as if inspirations were rarer\r\nthan pearls, as in his milieu they undoubtedly were. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is the equal\r\nof any situation, I am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; and then abandoned the subject\r\nwith one of his automatic transitions.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, in the embrasure of a drawing-room window, he surprised\r\nNick by returning to the same topic, and this time without thinking it\r\nneedful to readjust his smile. His face remained serious, though his\r\nmanner was studiously informal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was admiring, at dinner, Miss Hicks\xe2\x80\x99s invariable sense of\r\nappropriateness. It must permit her friends to foresee for her almost\r\nany future, however exalted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLansing hesitated, and controlled his annoyance. Decidedly he wanted to\r\nknow what was in his companion\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by exalted?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with a smile of faint\r\namusement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--equal to her marvellous capacity for shining in the public eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLansing still smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cThe question is, I suppose, whether her desire to\r\nshine equals her capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe aide-de-camp stared. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean, she\xe2\x80\x99s not ambitious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary; I believe her to be immeasurably ambitious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImmeasurably?\xe2\x80\x9d The aide-de-camp seemed to try to measure it. \xe2\x80\x9cBut not,\r\nsurely, beyond--beyond what we can offer,\xe2\x80\x9d his eyes completed the\r\nsentence; and it was Lansing\xe2\x80\x99s turn to stare. The aide-de-camp faced the\r\nstare. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d his eyes concluded in a flash, while his lips let fall:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Princess Mother admires her immensely.\xe2\x80\x9d But at that moment a wave\r\nof Mrs. Hicks\xe2\x80\x99s fan drew them hurriedly from their embrasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProfessor Darchivio had promised to explain to us the difference\r\nbetween the Sassanian and Byzantine motives in Carolingian art; but the\r\nManager has sent up word that the two new Creole dancers from Paris have\r\narrived, and her Serene Highness wants to pop down to the ball-room and\r\ntake a peep at them.... She\xe2\x80\x99s sure the Professor will understand....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd accompany us, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d the Princess irresistibly added.\r\n\r\nLansing\xe2\x80\x99s brief colloquy in the Nouveau Luxe window had lifted the\r\nscales from his eyes. Innumerable dim corners of memory had been flooded\r\nwith light by that one quick glance of the aide-de-camp\xe2\x80\x99s: things he\r\nhad heard, hints he had let pass, smiles, insinuations, cordialities,\r\nrumours of the improbability of the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s founding a family,\r\nsuggestions as to the urgent need of replenishing the Teutoburger\r\ntreasury....\r\n\r\nMiss Hicks, perforce, had accompanied her parents and their princely\r\nguests to the ballroom; but as she did not dance, and took little\r\ninterest in the sight of others so engaged, she remained aloof from the\r\nparty, absorbed in an archaeological discussion with the baffled but\r\nsmiling savant who was to have enlightened the party on the difference\r\nbetween Sassanian and Byzantine ornament.\r\n\r\nLansing, also aloof, had picked out a post from which he could observe\r\nthe girl: she wore a new look to him since he had seen her as the centre\r\nof all these scattered threads of intrigue. Yes; decidedly she was\r\ngrowing handsomer; or else she had learned how to set off her massive\r\nlines instead of trying to disguise them. As she held up her long\r\neye-glass to glance absently at the dancers he was struck by the large\r\nbeauty of her arm and the careless assurance of the gesture. There was\r\nnothing nervous or fussy about Coral Hicks; and he was not surprised\r\nthat, plastically at least, the Princess Mother had discerned her\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\nNick Lansing, all that night, sat up and stared at his future. He knew\r\nenough of the society into which the Hickses had drifted to guess that,\r\nwithin a very short time, the hint of the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s aide-de-camp would\r\nreappear in the form of a direct proposal. Lansing himself would\r\nprobably--as the one person in the Hicks entourage with whom one\r\ncould intelligibly commune--be entrusted with the next step in the\r\nnegotiations: he would be asked, as the aide-de-camp would have said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cto feel the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d It was clearly part of the state policy of\r\nTeutoburg to offer Miss Hicks, with the hand of its sovereign, an\r\nopportunity to replenish its treasury.\r\n\r\nWhat would the girl do? Lansing could not guess; yet he dimly felt that\r\nher attitude would depend in a great degree upon his own. And he knew\r\nno more what his own was going to be than on the night, four months\r\nearlier, when he had flung out of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s room in Venice to take the\r\nmidnight express for Genoa.\r\n\r\nThe whole of his past, and above all the tendency, on which he had once\r\nprided himself, to live in the present and take whatever chances it\r\noffered, now made it harder for him to act. He began to see that he\r\nhad never, even in the closest relations of life, looked ahead of his\r\nimmediate satisfaction. He had thought it rather fine to be able to give\r\nhimself so intensely to the fullness of each moment instead of hurrying\r\npast it in pursuit of something more, or something else, in the manner\r\nof the over-scrupulous or the under-imaginative, whom he had always\r\ngrouped together and equally pitied. It was not till he had linked his\r\nlife with Susy\xe2\x80\x99s that he had begun to feel it reaching forward into a\r\nfuture he longed to make sure of, to fasten upon and shape to his own\r\nwants and purposes, till, by an imperceptible substitution, that future\r\nhad become his real present, his all-absorbing moment of time.\r\n\r\nNow the moment was shattered, and the power to rebuild it failed him.\r\nHe had never before thought about putting together broken bits: he felt\r\nlike a man whose house has been wrecked by an earthquake, and who, for\r\nlack of skilled labour, is called upon for the first time to wield a\r\ntrowel and carry bricks. He simply did not know how.\r\n\r\nWill-power, he saw, was not a thing one could suddenly decree oneself\r\nto possess. It must be built up imperceptibly and laboriously out of a\r\nsuccession of small efforts to meet definite objects, out of the facing\r\nof daily difficulties instead of cleverly eluding them, or shifting\r\ntheir burden on others. The making of the substance called character was\r\na process about as slow and arduous as the building of the Pyramids; and\r\nthe thing itself, like those awful edifices, was mainly useful to lodge\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s descendants in, after they too were dust. Yet the Pyramid-instinct\r\nwas the one which had made the world, made man, and caused his fugitive\r\njoys to linger like fading frescoes on imperishable walls....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON the drive back from her dinner at the Nouveau Luxe, events had\r\nfollowed the course foreseen by Susy.\r\n\r\nShe had promised Strefford to seek legal advice about her divorce, and\r\nhe had kissed her; and the promise had been easier to make than she had\r\nexpected, the kiss less difficult to receive.\r\n\r\nShe had gone to the dinner a-quiver with the mortification of learning\r\nthat her husband was still with the Hickses. Morally sure of it though\r\nshe had been, the discovery was a shock, and she measured for the\r\nfirst time the abyss between fearing and knowing. No wonder he had not\r\nwritten--the modern husband did not have to: he had only to leave it to\r\ntime and the newspapers to make known his intentions. Susy could imagine\r\nNick\xe2\x80\x99s saying to himself, as he sometimes used to say when she reminded\r\nhim of an unanswered letter: \xe2\x80\x9cBut there are lots of ways of answering a\r\nletter--and writing doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen to be mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell--he had done it in his way, and she was answered. For a minute, as\r\nshe laid aside the paper, darkness submerged her, and she felt herself\r\ndropping down into the bottomless anguish of her dreadful vigil in the\r\nPalazzo Vanderlyn. But she was weary of anguish: her healthy body and\r\nnerves instinctively rejected it. The wave was spent, and she felt\r\nherself irresistibly struggling back to light and life and youth. He\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t want her! Well, she would try not to want him! There lay all the\r\nold expedients at her hand--the rouge for her white lips, the atropine\r\nfor her blurred eyes, the new dress on her bed, the thought of Strefford\r\nand his guests awaiting her, and of the conclusions that the diners of\r\nthe Nouveau Luxe would draw from seeing them together. Thank heaven no\r\none would say: \xe2\x80\x9cPoor old Susy--did you know Nick had chucked her?\xe2\x80\x9d They\r\nwould all say: \xe2\x80\x9cPoor old Nick! Yes, I daresay she was sorry to chuck\r\nhim; but Altringham\xe2\x80\x99s mad to marry her, and what could she do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd once again events had followed the course she had foreseen. Seeing\r\nher at Lord Altringham\xe2\x80\x99s table, with the Ascots and the old Duchess\r\nof Dunes, the interested spectators could not but regard the dinner as\r\nconfirming the rumour of her marriage. As Ellie said, people didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwait nowadays to announce their \xe2\x80\x9cengagements\xe2\x80\x9d till the tiresome divorce\r\nproceedings were over. Ellie herself, prodigally pearled and ermined,\r\nhad floated in late with Algie Bockheimer in her wake, and sat, in\r\nconspicuous t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate, nodding and signalling her sympathy to Susy.\r\nApproval beamed from every eye: it was awfully exciting, they all seemed\r\nto say, seeing Susy Lansing pull it off! As the party, after dinner,\r\ndrifted from the restaurant back into the hall, she caught, in the\r\nsmiles and hand-pressures crowding about her, the scarcely-repressed\r\nhint of official congratulations; and Violet Melrose, seated in a corner\r\nwith Fulmer, drew her down with a wan jade-circled arm, to whisper\r\ntenderly: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s most awfully clever of you, darling, not to be wearing\r\nany jewels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn all the women\xe2\x80\x99s eyes she read the reflected lustre of the jewels she\r\ncould wear when she chose: it was as though their glitter reached\r\nher from the far-off bank where they lay sealed up in the Altringham\r\nstrong-box. What a fool she had been to think that Strefford would ever\r\nbelieve she didn\xe2\x80\x99t care for them!\r\n\r\nThe Ambassadress, a blank perpendicular person, had been a shade less\r\naffable than Susy could have wished; but then there was Lady Joan--and\r\nthe girl was handsome, alarmingly handsome to account for that: probably\r\nevery one in the room had guessed it. And the old Duchess of Dunes was\r\ndelightful. She looked rather like Strefford in a wig and false pearls\r\n(Susy was sure they were as false as her teeth); and her cordiality\r\nwas so demonstrative that the future bride found it more difficult to\r\naccount for than Lady Ascot\xe2\x80\x99s coldness, till she heard the old lady, as\r\nthey passed into the hall, breathe in a hissing whisper to her nephew:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStreff, dearest, when you have a minute\xe2\x80\x99s time, and can drop in at\r\nmy wretched little pension, I know you can explain in two words what\r\nI ought to do to pacify those awful money-lenders.... And you\xe2\x80\x99ll bring\r\nyour exquisite American to see me, won\xe2\x80\x99t you!... No, Joan Senechal\xe2\x80\x99s too\r\nfair for my taste.... Insipid....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes: the taste of it all was again sweet on her lips. A few days later\r\nshe began to wonder how the thought of Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s endearments could\r\nhave been so alarming. To be sure he was not lavish of them; but when he\r\ndid touch her, even when he kissed her, it no longer seemed to matter.\r\nAn almost complete absence of sensation had mercifully succeeded to the\r\nfirst wild flurry of her nerves.\r\n\r\nAnd so it would be, no doubt, with everything else in her new life. If\r\nit failed to provoke any acute reactions, whether of pain or pleasure,\r\nthe very absence of sensation would make for peace. And in the meanwhile\r\nshe was tasting what, she had begun to suspect, was the maximum of\r\nbliss to most of the women she knew: days packed with engagements, the\r\nexhilaration of fashionable crowds, the thrill of snapping up a jewel\r\nor a bibelot or a new \xe2\x80\x9cmodel\xe2\x80\x9d that one\xe2\x80\x99s best friend wanted, or of being\r\ninvited to some private show, or some exclusive entertainment, that\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s best friend couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get to. There was nothing, now, that she\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t buy, nowhere that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go: she had only to choose and\r\nto triumph. And for a while the surface-excitement of her life gave her\r\nthe illusion of enjoyment.\r\n\r\nStrefford, as she had expected, had postponed his return to England,\r\nand they had now been for nearly three weeks together in their new, and\r\nvirtually avowed, relation. She had fancied that, after all, the easiest\r\npart of it would be just the being with Strefford--the falling back\r\non their old tried friendship to efface the sense of strangeness. But,\r\nthough she had so soon grown used to his caresses, he himself remained\r\ncuriously unfamiliar: she was hardly sure, at times, that it was the\r\nold Strefford she was talking to. It was not that his point of view had\r\nchanged, but that new things occupied and absorbed him. In all the small\r\nsides of his great situation he took an almost childish satisfaction;\r\nand though he still laughed at both its privileges and its obligations,\r\nit was now with a jealous laughter.\r\n\r\nIt amused him inexhaustibly, for instance, to be made up to by all the\r\npeople who had always disapproved of him, and to unite at the same table\r\npersons who had to dissemble their annoyance at being invited together\r\nlest they should not be invited at all. Equally exhilarating was\r\nthe capricious favouring of the dull and dowdy on occasions when the\r\nbrilliant and disreputable expected his notice. It enchanted him, for\r\nexample, to ask the old Duchess of Dunes and Violet Melrose to dine\r\nwith the Vicar of Altringham, on his way to Switzerland for a month\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nholiday, and to watch the face of the Vicar\xe2\x80\x99s wife while the Duchess\r\nnarrated her last difficulties with book-makers and money-lenders, and\r\nViolet proclaimed the rights of Love and Genius to all that had once\r\nbeen supposed to belong exclusively to Respectability and Dulness.\r\n\r\nSusy had to confess that her own amusements were hardly of a higher\r\norder; but then she put up with them for lack of better, whereas\r\nStrefford, who might have had what he pleased, was completely satisfied\r\nwith such triumphs.\r\n\r\nSomehow, in spite of his honours and his opportunities, he seemed to\r\nhave shrunk. The old Strefford had certainly been a larger person,\r\nand she wondered if material prosperity were always a beginning of\r\nossification. Strefford had been much more fun when he lived by his\r\nwits. Sometimes, now, when he tried to talk of politics, or assert\r\nhimself on some question of public interest, she was startled by his\r\nlimitations. Formerly, when he was not sure of his ground, it had been\r\nhis way to turn the difficulty by glib nonsense or easy irony; now he\r\nwas actually dull, at times almost pompous. She noticed too, for the\r\nfirst time, that he did not always hear clearly when several people were\r\ntalking at once, or when he was at the theatre; and he developed a habit\r\nof saying over and over again: \xe2\x80\x9cDoes so-and-so speak indistinctly? Or am\r\nI getting deaf, I wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d which wore on her nerves by its suggestion of\r\na corresponding mental infirmity.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts did not always trouble her. The current of idle activity\r\non which they were both gliding was her native element as well as his;\r\nand never had its tide been as swift, its waves as buoyant. In his\r\nrelation to her, too, he was full of tact and consideration. She saw\r\nthat he still remembered their frightened exchange of glances after\r\ntheir first kiss; and the sense of this little hidden spring of\r\nimagination in him was sometimes enough for her thirst.\r\n\r\nShe had always had a rather masculine punctuality in keeping her word,\r\nand after she had promised Strefford to take steps toward a divorce\r\nshe had promptly set about doing it. A sudden reluctance prevented her\r\nasking the advice of friends like Ellie Vanderlyn, whom she knew to be\r\nin the thick of the same negotiations, and all she could think of was to\r\nconsult a young American lawyer practicing in Paris, with whom she felt\r\nshe could talk the more easily because he was not from New York, and\r\nprobably unacquainted with her history.\r\n\r\nShe was so ignorant of the procedure in such matters that she was\r\nsurprised and relieved at his asking few personal questions; but it was\r\na shock to learn that a divorce could not be obtained, either in New\r\nYork or Paris, merely on the ground of desertion or incompatibility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought nowadays... if people preferred to live apart... it could\r\nalways be managed,\xe2\x80\x9d she stammered, wondering at her own ignorance, after\r\nthe many conjugal ruptures she had assisted at.\r\n\r\nThe young lawyer smiled, and coloured slightly. His lovely client\r\nevidently intimidated him by her grace, and still more by her\r\ninexperience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt can be--generally,\xe2\x80\x9d he admitted; \xe2\x80\x9cand especially so if... as I\r\ngather is the case... your husband is equally anxious....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, quite!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, suddenly humiliated by having to admit it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then--may I suggest that, to bring matters to a point, the best\r\nway would be for you to write to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe recoiled slightly. It had never occurred to her that the lawyers\r\nwould not \xe2\x80\x9cmanage it\xe2\x80\x9d without her intervention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrite to him... but what about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, expressing your wish... to recover your freedom.... The rest, I\r\nassume,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young lawyer, \xe2\x80\x9cmay be left to Mr. Lansing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not know exactly what he meant, and was too much perturbed by\r\nthe idea of having to communicate with Nick to follow any other train\r\nof thought. How could she write such a letter? And yet how could she\r\nconfess to the lawyer that she had not the courage to do so? He\r\nwould, of course, tell her to go home and be reconciled. She hesitated\r\nperplexedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be better,\xe2\x80\x9d she suggested, \xe2\x80\x9cif the letter were to come\r\nfrom--from your office?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe considered this politely. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the whole: no. If, as I take it, an\r\namicable arrangement is necessary--to secure the requisite evidence then\r\na line from you, suggesting an interview, seems to me more advisable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn interview? Is an interview necessary?\xe2\x80\x9d She was ashamed to show her\r\nagitation to this cautiously smiling young man, who must wonder at\r\nher childish lack of understanding; but the break in her voice was\r\nuncontrollable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, please write to him--I can\xe2\x80\x99t! And I can\xe2\x80\x99t see him! Oh, can\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\narrange it for me?\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded.\r\n\r\nShe saw now that her idea of a divorce had been that it was something\r\none went out--or sent out--to buy in a shop: something concrete and\r\nportable, that Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s money could pay for, and that it required no\r\npersonal participation to obtain. What a fool the lawyer must think her!\r\nStiffening herself, she rose from her seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy husband and I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to see each other again.... I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\r\nwould be useless... and very painful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are the best judge, of course. But in any case, a letter from\r\nyou, a friendly letter, seems wiser... considering the apparent lack of\r\nevidence....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then; I\xe2\x80\x99ll write,\xe2\x80\x9d she agreed, and hurried away, scarcely\r\nhearing his parting injunction that she should take a copy of her\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nThat night she wrote. At the last moment it might have been impossible,\r\nif at the theatre little Breckenridge had not bobbed into her box. He\r\nwas just back from Rome, where he had dined with the Hickses (\xe2\x80\x9ca bang-up\r\nshow--they\xe2\x80\x99re really lances--you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know them!\xe2\x80\x9d), and had met there\r\nLansing, whom he reported as intending to marry Coral \xe2\x80\x9cas soon as things\r\nwere settled\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were dead right, weren\xe2\x80\x99t you, Susy,\xe2\x80\x9d he snickered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat night in Venice last summer, when we all thought you were joking\r\nabout their engagement? Pity now you chucked our surprise visit to the\r\nHickses, and sent Streff up to drag us back just as we were breaking in!\r\nYou remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe flung off the \xe2\x80\x9cStreff\xe2\x80\x9d airily, in the old way, but with a tentative\r\nside-glance at his host; and Lord Altringham, leaning toward Susy, said\r\ncoldly: \xe2\x80\x9cWas Breckenridge speaking about me? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t catch what he\r\nsaid. Does he speak indistinctly--or am I getting deaf, I wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter that it seemed comparatively easy, when Strefford had dropped her\r\nat her hotel, to go upstairs and write. She dashed off the date and her\r\naddress, and then stopped; but suddenly she remembered Breckenridge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsnicker, and the words rushed from her. \xe2\x80\x9cNick dear, it was July when you\r\nleft Venice, and I have had no word from you since the note in which you\r\nsaid you had gone for a few days, and that I should hear soon again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t written yet, and it is five months since you left me. That\r\nmeans, I suppose, that you want to take back your freedom and give me\r\nmine. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be kinder, in that case, to tell me so? It is worse\r\nthan anything to go on as we are now. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to put these\r\nthings but since you seem unwilling to write to me perhaps you would\r\nprefer to send your answer to Mr. Frederic Spearman, the American lawyer\r\nhere. His address is 100, Boulevard Haussmann. I hope--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe broke off on the last word. Hope? What did she hope, either for him\r\nor for herself? Wishes for his welfare would sound like a mockery--and\r\nshe would rather her letter should seem bitter than unfeeling. Above\r\nall, she wanted to get it done. To have to re-write even those few\r\nlines would be torture. So she left \xe2\x80\x9cI hope,\xe2\x80\x9d and simply added: \xe2\x80\x9cto hear\r\nbefore long what you have decided.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe read it over, and shivered. Not one word of the past--not one\r\nallusion to that mysterious interweaving of their lives which had\r\nenclosed them one in the other like the flower in its sheath! What place\r\nhad such memories in such a letter? She had the feeling that she wanted\r\nto hide that other Nick away in her own bosom, and with him the other\r\nSusy, the Susy he had once imagined her to be.... Neither of them seemed\r\nconcerned with the present business.\r\n\r\nThe letter done, she stared at the sealed envelope till its presence\r\nin the room became intolerable, and she understood that she must either\r\ntear it up or post it immediately. She went down to the hall of the\r\nsleeping hotel, and bribed the night-porter to carry the letter to the\r\nnearest post office, though he objected that, at that hour, no time\r\nwould be gained. \xe2\x80\x9cI want it out of the house,\xe2\x80\x9d she insisted: and waited\r\nsternly by the desk, in her dressing-gown, till he had performed the\r\nerrand.\r\n\r\nAs she re-entered her room, the disordered writing-table struck her; and\r\nshe remembered the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s injunction to take a copy of her letter. A\r\ncopy to be filed away with the documents in \xe2\x80\x9cLansing versus Lansing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She burst out laughing at the idea. What were lawyers made of, she\r\nwondered? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t the man guess, by the mere look in her eyes and the\r\nsound of her voice, that she would never, as long as she lived, forget\r\na word of that letter--that night after night she would lie down, as she\r\nwas lying down to-night, to stare wide-eyed for hours into the darkness,\r\nwhile a voice in her brain monotonously hammered out: \xe2\x80\x9cNick dear, it was\r\nJuly when you left me...\xe2\x80\x9d and so on, word after word, down to the last\r\nfatal syllable?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTREFFORD was leaving for England.\r\n\r\nOnce assured that Susy had taken the first step toward freeing herself,\r\nhe frankly regarded her as his affianced wife, and could see no reason\r\nfor further mystery. She understood his impatience to have their\r\nplans settled; it would protect him from the formidable menace of the\r\nmarriageable, and cause people, as he said, to stop meddling. Now that\r\nthe novelty of his situation was wearing off, his natural indolence\r\nreasserted itself, and there was nothing he dreaded more than having to\r\nbe on his guard against the innumerable plans that his well-wishers were\r\nperpetually making for him. Sometimes Susy fancied he was marrying her\r\nbecause to do so was to follow the line of least resistance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo marry me is the easiest way of not marrying all the others,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nlaughed, as he stood before her one day in a quiet alley of the Bois\r\nde Boulogne, insisting on the settlement of various preliminaries. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nbelieve I\xe2\x80\x99m only a protection to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn odd gleam passed behind his eyes, and she instantly guessed that he\r\nwas thinking: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what else am I to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe changed colour, and he rejoined, laughing also: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99re that\r\nat any rate, thank the Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pondered, and then questioned: \xe2\x80\x9cBut in the interval--how are you\r\ngoing to defend yourself for another year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to see to that; you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to take a little house in\r\nLondon. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to look after me, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was on the tip of her tongue to flash back: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, if that\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nyou care--!\xe2\x80\x9d But caring was exactly the factor she wanted, as much as\r\npossible, to keep out of their talk and their thoughts. She could\r\nnot ask him how much he cared without laying herself open to the same\r\nquestion; and that way terror lay. As a matter of fact, though Strefford\r\nwas not an ardent wooer--perhaps from tact, perhaps from temperament,\r\nperhaps merely from the long habit of belittling and disintegrating\r\nevery sentiment and every conviction--yet she knew he did care for her\r\nas much as he was capable of caring for anyone. If the element of habit\r\nentered largely into the feeling--if he liked her, above all, because he\r\nwas used to her, knew her views, her indulgences, her allowances, knew\r\nhe was never likely to be bored, and almost certain to be amused, by\r\nher; why, such ingredients though not of the fieriest, were perhaps\r\nthose most likely to keep his feeling for her at a pleasant temperature.\r\nShe had had a taste of the tropics, and wanted more equable weather; but\r\nthe idea of having to fan his flame gently for a year was unspeakably\r\ndepressing to her. Yet all this was precisely what she could not say.\r\nThe long period of probation, during which, as she knew, she would\r\nhave to amuse him, to guard him, to hold him, and to keep off the other\r\nwomen, was a necessary part of their situation. She was sure that, as\r\nlittle Breckenridge would have said, she could \xe2\x80\x9cpull it off\xe2\x80\x9d; but she\r\ndid not want to think about it. What she would have preferred would have\r\nbeen to go away--no matter where and not see Strefford again till they\r\nwere married. But she dared not tell him that either.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little house in London--?\xe2\x80\x9d She wondered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have some sort of a roof over your head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down beside her. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you like me well enough to live at\r\nAltringham some day, won\xe2\x80\x99t you, in the meantime, let me provide you with\r\na smaller and more convenient establishment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill she hesitated. The alternative, she knew, would be to live on\r\nUrsula Gillow, Violet Melrose, or some other of her rich friends, any\r\none of whom would be ready to lavish the largest hospitality on the\r\nprospective Lady Altringham. Such an arrangement, in the long run,\r\nwould be no less humiliating to her pride, no less destructive to\r\nher independence, than Altringham\xe2\x80\x99s little establishment. But she\r\ntemporized. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall go over to London in December, and stay for a while\r\nwith various people--then we can look about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right; as you like.\xe2\x80\x9d He obviously considered her hesitation\r\nridiculous, but was too full of satisfaction at her having started\r\ndivorce proceedings to be chilled by her reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, look here, my dear; couldn\xe2\x80\x99t I give you some sort of a ring?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA ring?\xe2\x80\x9d She flushed at the suggestion. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use, Streff, dear?\r\nWith all those jewels locked away in London--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I daresay you\xe2\x80\x99ll think them old-fashioned. And, hang it, why\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I give you something new, I ran across Ellie and Bockheimer\r\nyesterday, in the rue de la Paix, picking out sapphires. Do you like\r\nsapphires, or emeralds? Or just a diamond? I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a thumping one....\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d like you to have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEllie and Bockheimer! How she hated the conjunction of the names! Their\r\ncase always seemed to her like a caricature of her own, and she felt an\r\nunreasoning resentment against Ellie for having selected the same season\r\nfor her unmating and re-mating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak of them, Streff... as if they were like us! I\r\ncan hardly bear to sit in the same room with Ellie Vanderlyn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo? What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong? You mean because of her giving up Clarissa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that only.... You don\xe2\x80\x99t know.... I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you....\xe2\x80\x9d She shivered\r\nat the memory, and rose restlessly from the bench where they had been\r\nsitting.\r\n\r\nStrefford gave his careless shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear, you can hardly expect\r\nme to agree, for after all it was to Ellie I owed the luck of being so\r\nlong alone with you in Venice. If she and Algie hadn\xe2\x80\x99t prolonged their\r\nhoneymoon at the villa--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped abruptly, and looked at Susy. She was conscious that every\r\ndrop of blood had left her face. She felt it ebbing away from her heart,\r\nflowing out of her as if from all her severed arteries, till it seemed\r\nas though nothing were left of life in her but one point of irreducible\r\npain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEllie--at your villa? What do you mean? Was it Ellie and Bockheimer\r\nwho--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrefford still stared. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean to say you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho came after Nick and me...?\xe2\x80\x9d she insisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, do you suppose I\xe2\x80\x99d have turned you out otherwise? That beastly\r\nBockheimer simply smothered me with gold. Ah, well, there\xe2\x80\x99s one good\r\nthing: I shall never have to let the villa again! I rather like the\r\nlittle place myself, and I daresay once in a while we might go there for\r\na day or two.... Susy, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nShe returned his stare, but without seeing him. Everything swam and\r\ndanced before her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she was there while I was posting all those letters for her--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLetters--what letters? What makes you look so frightfully upset?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pursued her thought as if he had not spoken. \xe2\x80\x9cShe and Algie\r\nBockheimer arrived there the very day that Nick and I left?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so. I thought she\xe2\x80\x99d told you. Ellie always tells everybody\r\neverything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe would have told me, I daresay--but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear, that was hardly my fault, was it? Though I really don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Susy, still blind to everything but the dance of dizzy sparks before\r\nher eyes, pressed on as if she had not heard him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was their motor,\r\nthen, that took us to Milan! It was Algie Bockheimer\xe2\x80\x99s motor!\xe2\x80\x9d She did\r\nnot know why, but this seemed to her the most humiliating incident in\r\nthe whole hateful business. She remembered Nick\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance to use the\r\nmotor--she remembered his look when she had boasted of her \xe2\x80\x9cmanaging.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n The nausea mounted to her throat.\r\n\r\nStrefford burst out laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cI say--you borrowed their motor? And you\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know whose it was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could I know? I persuaded the chauffeur... for a little tip....\r\nIt was to save our railway fares to Milan... extra luggage costs so\r\nfrightfully in Italy....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood old Susy! Well done! I can see you doing it--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how horrible--how horrible!\xe2\x80\x9d she groaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorrible? What\xe2\x80\x99s horrible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, your not seeing... not feeling...\xe2\x80\x9d she began impetuously; and then\r\nstopped. How could she explain to him that what revolted her was not so\r\nmuch the fact of his having given the little house, as soon as she and\r\nNick had left it, to those two people of all others--though the vision\r\nof them in the sweet secret house, and under the plane-trees of the\r\nterrace, drew such a trail of slime across her golden hours? No, it was\r\nnot that from which she most recoiled, but from the fact that Strefford,\r\nliving in luxury in Nelson Vanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s house, should at the same time\r\nhave secretly abetted Ellie Vanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s love-affairs, and allowed\r\nher--for a handsome price--to shelter them under his own roof. The\r\nreproach trembled on her lip--but she remembered her own part in the\r\nwretched business, and the impossibility of avowing it to Strefford, and\r\nof revealing to him that Nick had left her for that very reason. She was\r\nnot afraid that the discovery would diminish her in Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s eyes: he\r\nwas untroubled by moral problems, and would laugh away her avowal, with\r\na sneer at Nick in his new part of moralist. But that was just what she\r\ncould not bear: that anyone should cast a doubt on the genuineness of\r\nNick\xe2\x80\x99s standards, or should know how far below them she had fallen.\r\n\r\nShe remained silent, and Strefford, after a moment, drew her gently down\r\nto the seat beside him. \xe2\x80\x9cSusy, upon my soul I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ndriving at. Is it me you\xe2\x80\x99re angry with--or yourself? And what\xe2\x80\x99s it all\r\nabout! Are you disgusted because I let the villa to a couple who weren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmarried! But, hang it, they\xe2\x80\x99re the kind that pay the highest price and\r\nI had to earn my living somehow! One doesn\xe2\x80\x99t run across a bridal pair\r\nevery day....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe lifted her eyes to his puzzled incredulous face. Poor Streff! No,\r\nit was not with him that she was angry. Why should she be? Even that\r\nill-advised disclosure had told her nothing she had not already known\r\nabout him. It had simply revealed to her once more the real point of\r\nview of the people he and she lived among had shown her that, in spite\r\nof the superficial difference, he felt as they felt, judged as they\r\njudged, was blind as they were--and as she would be expected to be,\r\nshould she once again become one of them. What was the use of being\r\nplaced by fortune above such shifts and compromises, if in one\xe2\x80\x99s heart\r\none still condoned them? And she would have to--she would catch the\r\ngeneral note, grow blunted as those other people were blunted, and\r\ngradually come to wonder at her own revolt, as Strefford now honestly\r\nwondered at it. She felt as though she were on the point of losing some\r\nnew-found treasure, a treasure precious only to herself, but beside\r\nwhich all he offered her was nothing, the triumph of her wounded pride\r\nnothing, the security of her future nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Susy?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with the same puzzled gentleness.\r\n\r\nAh, the loneliness of never being able to make him understand! She had\r\nfelt lonely enough when the flaming sword of Nick\xe2\x80\x99s indignation had shut\r\nher out from their Paradise; but there had been a cruel bliss in the\r\npain. Nick had not opened her eyes to new truths, but had waked in her\r\nagain something which had lain unconscious under years of accumulated\r\nindifference. And that re-awakened sense had never left her since,\r\nand had somehow kept her from utter loneliness because it was a secret\r\nshared with Nick, a gift she owed to Nick, and which, in leaving her, he\r\ncould not take from her. It was almost, she suddenly felt, as if he had\r\nleft her with a child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear girl,\xe2\x80\x9d Strefford said, with a resigned glance at his watch,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou know we\xe2\x80\x99re dining at the Embassy....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the Embassy? She looked at him vaguely: then she remembered. Yes,\r\nthey were dining that night at the Ascots\xe2\x80\x99, with Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s cousin, the\r\nDuke of Dunes, and his wife, the handsome irreproachable young Duchess;\r\nwith the old gambling Dowager Duchess, whom her son and daughter-in-law\r\nhad come over from England to see; and with other English and French\r\nguests of a rank and standing worthy of the Duneses. Susy knew that her\r\ninclusion in such a dinner could mean but one thing: it was her definite\r\nrecognition as Altringham\xe2\x80\x99s future wife. She was \xe2\x80\x9cthe little American\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n whom one had to ask when one invited him, even on ceremonial occasions.\r\nThe family had accepted her; the Embassy could but follow suit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s late, dear; and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to see someone on business first,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Strefford reminded her patiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Streff--I can\xe2\x80\x99t, I can\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d The words broke from her without her\r\nknowing what she was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go with you--I can\xe2\x80\x99t go to the\r\nEmbassy. I can\xe2\x80\x99t go on any longer like this....\xe2\x80\x9d She lifted her eyes\r\nto his in desperate appeal. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, understand--do please understand!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwailed, knowing, while she spoke, the utter impossibility of what she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nStrefford\xe2\x80\x99s face had gradually paled and hardened. From sallow it turned\r\nto a dusky white, and lines of obstinacy deepened between the ironic\r\neyebrows and about the weak amused mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnderstand? What do you want me to understand,\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re trying to chuck me already?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shrank at the sneer of the \xe2\x80\x9calready,\xe2\x80\x9d but instantly remembered that\r\nit was the only thing he could be expected to say, since it was just\r\nbecause he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand that she was flying from him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Streff--if I knew how to tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t so much matter about the how. Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to\r\nsay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer head drooped, and she saw the dead leaves whirling across the path\r\nat her feet, lifted on a sudden wintry gust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe reason,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, clearing his throat with a stiff smile, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nnot quite as important to me as the fact.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stood speechless, agonized by his pain. But still, she thought, he\r\nhad remembered the dinner at the Embassy. The thought gave her courage\r\nto go on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do, Streff. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a bit the kind of person to make you\r\nhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, leave that to me, please, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t. Because I should be unhappy too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe clicked at the leaves as they whirled past. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve taken a rather\r\nlong time to find it out.\xe2\x80\x9d She saw that his new-born sense of his own\r\nconsequence was making him suffer even more than his wounded affection;\r\nand that again gave her courage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken long it\xe2\x80\x99s all the more reason why I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take\r\nlonger. If I\xe2\x80\x99ve made a mistake it\xe2\x80\x99s you who would have suffered from\r\nit....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor your extreme solicitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him helplessly, penetrated by the despairing sense of\r\ntheir inaccessibility to each other. Then she remembered that Nick,\r\nduring their last talk together, had seemed as inaccessible, and\r\nwondered if, when human souls try to get too near each other, they do\r\nnot inevitably become mere blurs to each other\xe2\x80\x99s vision. She would have\r\nliked to say this to Streff--but he would not have understood it either.\r\nThe sense of loneliness once more enveloped her, and she groped in vain\r\nfor a word that should reach him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go home alone, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d she appealed to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow--to-morrow....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tried, rather valiantly, to smile. \xe2\x80\x9cHang to-morrow! Whatever is wrong,\r\nit needn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent my seeing you home.\xe2\x80\x9d He glanced toward the taxi that\r\nawaited them at the end of the deserted drive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, please. You\xe2\x80\x99re in a hurry; take the taxi. I want immensely a long\r\nlong walk by myself... through the streets, with the lights coming\r\nout....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laid his hand on her arm. \xe2\x80\x9cI say, my dear, you\xe2\x80\x99re not ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I\xe2\x80\x99m not ill. But you may say I am, to-night at the Embassy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe released her and drew back. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, very well,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered coldly;\r\nand she understood by his tone that the knot was cut, and that at that\r\nmoment he almost hated her. She turned away, hastening down the deserted\r\nalley, flying from him, and knowing, as she fled, that he was still\r\nstanding there motionless, staring after her, wounded, humiliated,\r\nuncomprehending. It was neither her fault nor his....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAS she fled on toward the lights of the streets a breath of freedom\r\nseemed to blow into her face.\r\n\r\nLike a weary load the accumulated hypocrisies of the last months had\r\ndropped from her: she was herself again, Nick\xe2\x80\x99s Susy, and no one else\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nShe sped on, staring with bright bewildered eyes at the stately facades\r\nof the La Muette quarter, the perspectives of bare trees, the awakening\r\nglitter of shop-windows holding out to her all the things she would\r\nnever again be able to buy....\r\n\r\nIn an avenue of shops she paused before a milliner\xe2\x80\x99s window, and said\r\nto herself: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I earn my living by trimming hats?\xe2\x80\x9d She met\r\nwork-girls streaming out under a doorway, and scattering to catch trams\r\nand omnibuses; and she looked with newly-wakened interest at their tired\r\nindependent faces. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I earn my living as well as they do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she thought. A little farther on she passed a Sister of Charity with\r\nsoftly trotting feet, a calm anonymous glance, and hands hidden in her\r\ncapacious sleeves. Susy looked at her and thought: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I be\r\na Sister, and have no money to worry about, and trot about under a white\r\ncoif helping poor people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll these strangers on whom she smiled in passing, and glanced back at\r\nenviously, were free from the necessities that enslaved her, and would\r\nnot have known what she meant if she had told them that she must have\r\nso much money for her dresses, so much for her cigarettes, so much for\r\nbridge and cabs and tips, and all kinds of extras, and that at that\r\nmoment she ought to be hurrying back to a dinner at the British Embassy,\r\nwhere her permanent right to such luxuries was to be solemnly recognized\r\nand ratified.\r\n\r\nThe artificiality and unreality of her life overcame her as with\r\nstifling fumes. She stopped at a street-corner, drawing long panting\r\nbreaths as if she had been running a race. Then, slowly and aimlessly,\r\nshe began to saunter along a street of small private houses in damp\r\ngardens that led to the Avenue du Bois. She sat down on a bench. Not far\r\noff, the Arc de Triomphe raised its august bulk, and beyond it a\r\nriver of lights streamed down toward Paris, and the stir of the city\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart-beats troubled the quiet in her bosom. But not for long. She\r\nseemed to be looking at it all from the other side of the grave; and\r\nas she got up and wandered down the Champs Elysees, half empty in the\r\nevening lull between dusk and dinner, she felt as if the glittering\r\navenue were really changed into the Field of Shadows from which it takes\r\nits name, and as if she were a ghost among ghosts.\r\n\r\nHalfway home, a weakness of loneliness overcame her, and she seated\r\nherself under the trees near the Rond Point. Lines of motors and\r\ncarriages were beginning to animate the converging thoroughfares,\r\nstreaming abreast, crossing, winding in and out of each other in a\r\ntangle of hurried pleasure-seeking. She caught the light on jewels and\r\nshirt-fronts and hard bored eyes emerging from dim billows of fur and\r\nvelvet. She seemed to hear what the couples were saying to each other,\r\nshe pictured the drawing-rooms, restaurants, dance-halls they were\r\nhastening to, the breathless routine that was hurrying them along, as\r\nTime, the old vacuum-cleaner, swept them away with the dust of their\r\ncarriage-wheels. And again the loneliness vanished in a sense of\r\nrelease....\r\n\r\nAt the corner of the Place de la Concorde she stopped, recognizing a\r\nman in evening dress who was hailing a taxi. Their eyes met, and Nelson\r\nVanderlyn came forward. He was the last person she cared to run across,\r\nand she shrank back involuntarily. What did he know, what had he\r\nguessed, of her complicity in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s affairs? No doubt Ellie had\r\nblabbed it all out by this time; she was just as likely to confide her\r\nlove-affairs to Nelson as to anyone else, now that the Bockheimer prize\r\nwas landed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--well--well--so I\xe2\x80\x99ve caught you at it! Glad to see you, Susy,\r\nmy dear.\xe2\x80\x9d She found her hand cordially clasped in Vanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\nhis round pink face bent on her with all its old urbanity. Did nothing\r\nmatter, then, in this world she was fleeing from, did no one love or\r\nhate or remember?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo idea you were in Paris--just got here myself,\xe2\x80\x9d Vanderlyn continued,\r\nvisibly delighted at the meeting. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re out\r\nof a job this evening by any chance, and would come and cheer up a lone\r\nbachelor, eh? No? You are? Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s luck for once! I say, where\r\nshall we go? One of the places where they dance, I suppose? Yes, I twirl\r\nthe light fantastic once in a while myself. Got to keep up with the\r\ntimes! Hold on, taxi! Here--I\xe2\x80\x99ll drive you home first, and wait while\r\nyou jump into your toggery. Lots of time.\xe2\x80\x9d As he steered her toward the\r\ncarriage she noticed that he had a gouty limp, and pulled himself in\r\nafter her with difficulty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMayn\xe2\x80\x99t I come as I am, Nelson, I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like dancing. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go and\r\ndine in one of those nice smoky little restaurants by the Place de la\r\nBourse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed surprised but relieved at the suggestion, and they rolled off\r\ntogether. In a corner at Bauge\xe2\x80\x99s they found a quiet table, screened from\r\nthe other diners, and while Vanderlyn adjusted his eyeglasses to study\r\nthe carte Susy stole a long look at him. He was dressed with even more\r\nthan his usual formal trimness, and she detected, in an ultra-flat\r\nwrist-watch and discreetly expensive waistcoat buttons, an attempt at\r\nsmartness altogether new. His face had undergone the same change: its\r\nfamiliar look of worn optimism had been, as it were, done up to match\r\nhis clothes, as though a sort of moral cosmetic had made him pinker,\r\nshinier and sprightlier without really rejuvenating him. A thin veil of\r\nhigh spirits had merely been drawn over his face, as the shining strands\r\nof hair were skilfully brushed over his baldness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere! Carte des vins, waiter! What champagne, Susy?\xe2\x80\x9d He chose,\r\nfastidiously, the best the cellar could produce, grumbling a little at\r\nthe bourgeois character of the dishes. \xe2\x80\x9cCapital food of its kind, no\r\ndoubt, but coarsish, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think? Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind... it\xe2\x80\x99s rather\r\na jolly change from the Luxe cooking. A new sensation--I\xe2\x80\x99m all for new\r\nsensations, ain\xe2\x80\x99t you, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d He re-filled their champagne glasses,\r\nflung an arm sideways over his chair, and smiled at her with a foggy\r\nbenevolence.\r\n\r\nAs the champagne flowed his confidences flowed with it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you know what I\xe2\x80\x99m here for--this divorce business? We wanted to\r\nsettle it quietly without a fuss, and of course Paris is the best place\r\nfor that sort of job. Live and let live; no questions asked. None\r\nof your dirty newspapers. Great country, this. No hypocrisy... they\r\nunderstand Life over here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy gazed and listened. She remembered that people had thought Nelson\r\nwould make a row when he found out. He had always been addicted to\r\ntruculent anecdotes about unfaithful wives, and the very formula of\r\nhis perpetual ejaculation--\xe2\x80\x9cCaught you at it, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d--seemed to hint at a\r\nconstant preoccupation with such ideas. But now it was evident that,\r\nas the saying was, he had \xe2\x80\x9cswallowed his dose\xe2\x80\x9d like all the others. No\r\nstrong blast of indignation had momentarily lifted him above his normal\r\nstature: he remained a little man among little men, and his eagerness to\r\nrebuild his life with all the old smiling optimism reminded Susy of the\r\npatient industry of an ant remaking its ruined ant-heap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell you what, great thing, this liberty! Everything\xe2\x80\x99s changed\r\nnowadays; why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t marriage be too? A man can get out of a business\r\npartnership when he wants to; but the parsons want to keep us noosed up\r\nto each other for life because we\xe2\x80\x99ve blundered into a church one day and\r\nsaid \xe2\x80\x98Yes\xe2\x80\x99 before one of \xe2\x80\x99em. No, no--that\xe2\x80\x99s too easy. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nbeyond that. Science, and all these new discoveries.... I say the Ten\r\nCommandments were made for man, and not man for the Commandments; and\r\nthere ain\xe2\x80\x99t a word against divorce in \xe2\x80\x99em, anyhow! That\xe2\x80\x99s what I tell my\r\npoor old mother, who builds everything on her Bible. Find me the place\r\nwhere it says: \xe2\x80\x98Thou shalt not sue for divorce.\xe2\x80\x99 It makes her wild, poor\r\nold lady, because she can\xe2\x80\x99t; and she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know how they happen to\r\nhave left it out.... I rather think Moses left it out because he knew\r\nmore about human nature than these snivelling modern parsons do. Not\r\nthat they\xe2\x80\x99ll always bear investigating either; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t care about\r\nthat. Live and let live, eh, Susy? Haven\xe2\x80\x99t we all got a right to our\r\nAffinities? I hear you\xe2\x80\x99re following our example yourself. First-rate\r\nidea: I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind telling you I saw it coming on last summer at Venice.\r\nCaught you at it, so to speak! Old Nelson ain\xe2\x80\x99t as blind as people\r\nthink. Here, let\xe2\x80\x99s open another bottle to the health of Streff and Mrs.\r\nStreff!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe caught the hand with which he was signalling to the sommelier.\r\nThis flushed and garrulous Nelson moved her more poignantly than a\r\nmore heroic figure. \xe2\x80\x9cNo more champagne, please, Nelson. Besides,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsuddenly added, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s not true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stared. \xe2\x80\x9cNot true that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to marry Altringham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy George then what on earth did you chuck Nick for? Ain\xe2\x80\x99t you got an\r\nAffinity, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed and shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to tell me it\xe2\x80\x99s all Nick\xe2\x80\x99s doing, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk of you instead, Nelson. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you\xe2\x80\x99re in\r\nsuch good spirits. I rather thought--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe interrupted her quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cThought I\xe2\x80\x99d cut up a rumpus--do some\r\nshooting? I know--people did.\xe2\x80\x9d He twisted his moustache, evidently proud\r\nof his reputation. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, maybe I did see red for a day or two--but I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\na philosopher, first and last. Before I went into banking I\xe2\x80\x99d made and\r\nlost two fortunes out West. Well, how did I build \xe2\x80\x99em up again? Not by\r\nshooting anybody even myself. By just buckling to, and beginning all\r\nover again. That\xe2\x80\x99s how... and that\xe2\x80\x99s what I am doing now. Beginning all\r\nover again.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice dropped from boastfulness to a note of wistful\r\nmelancholy, the look of strained jauntiness fell from his face like a\r\nmask, and for an instant she saw the real man, old, ruined, lonely. Yes,\r\nthat was it: he was lonely, desperately lonely, foundering in such deep\r\nseas of solitude that any presence out of the past was like a spar to\r\nwhich he clung. Whatever he knew or guessed of the part she had played\r\nin his disaster, it was not callousness that had made him greet her with\r\nsuch forgiving warmth, but the same sense of smallness, insignificance\r\nand isolation which perpetually hung like a cold fog on her own horizon.\r\nSuddenly she too felt old--old and unspeakably tired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been nice seeing you, Nelson. But now I must be getting home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe offered no objection, but asked for the bill, resumed his jaunty air\r\nwhile he scattered largesse among the waiters, and sauntered out behind\r\nher after calling for a taxi.\r\n\r\nThey drove off in silence. Susy was thinking: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Clarissa?\xe2\x80\x9d but dared\r\nnot ask. Vanderlyn lit a cigarette, hummed a dance-tune, and stared out\r\nof the window. Suddenly she felt his hand on hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSusy--do you ever see her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee--Ellie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded, without turning toward her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot often... sometimes....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you do, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake tell her I\xe2\x80\x99m happy... happy as a king...\r\ntell her you could see for yourself that I was....\xe2\x80\x9d His voice broke in\r\na little gasp. \xe2\x80\x9cI... I\xe2\x80\x99ll be damned if... if she shall ever be unhappy\r\nabout me... if I can help it....\xe2\x80\x9d The cigarette dropped from his\r\nfingers, and with a sob he covered his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, poor Nelson--poor Nelson,\xe2\x80\x9d Susy breathed. While their cab rattled\r\nacross the Place du Carrousel, and over the bridge, he continued to\r\nsit beside her with hidden face. At last he pulled out a scented\r\nhandkerchief, rubbed his eyes with it, and groped for another cigarette.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m all right! Tell her that, will you, Susy? There are some of our old\r\ntimes I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I shall ever forget; but they make me feel kindly\r\nto her, and not angry. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it would be so, beforehand--but it\r\nis.... And now the thing\xe2\x80\x99s settled I\xe2\x80\x99m as right as a trivet, and you can\r\ntell her so.... Look here, Susy...\xe2\x80\x9d he caught her by the arm as the taxi\r\ndrew up at her hotel.... \xe2\x80\x9cTell her I understand, will you? I\xe2\x80\x99d rather\r\nlike her to know that....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell her, Nelson,\xe2\x80\x9d she promised; and climbed the stairs alone to\r\nher dreary room.\r\n\r\nSusy\xe2\x80\x99s one fear was that Strefford, when he returned the next day,\r\nshould treat their talk of the previous evening as a fit of \xe2\x80\x9cnerves\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n to be jested away. He might, indeed, resent her behaviour too deeply\r\nto seek to see her at once; but his easygoing modern attitude toward\r\nconduct and convictions made that improbable. She had an idea that\r\nwhat he had most minded was her dropping so unceremoniously out of the\r\nEmbassy Dinner.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, why should she see him again? She had had enough of\r\nexplanations during the last months to have learned how seldom they\r\nexplain anything. If the other person did not understand at the first\r\nword, at the first glance even, subsequent elucidations served only to\r\ndeepen the obscurity. And she wanted above all--and especially since her\r\nhour with Nelson Vanderlyn--to keep herself free, aloof, to retain\r\nher hold on her precariously recovered self. She sat down and wrote to\r\nStrefford--and the letter was only a little less painful to write than\r\nthe one she had despatched to Nick. It was not that her own feelings\r\nwere in any like measure engaged; but because, as the decision to give\r\nup Strefford affirmed itself, she remembered only his kindness, his\r\nforbearance, his good humour, and all the other qualities she had always\r\nliked in him; and because she felt ashamed of the hesitations which must\r\ncause him so much pain and humiliation. Yes: humiliation chiefly. She\r\nknew that what she had to say would hurt his pride, in whatever way she\r\nframed her renunciation; and her pen wavered, hating its task. Then she\r\nremembered Vanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s words about his wife: \xe2\x80\x9cThere are some of our\r\nold times I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I shall ever forget--\xe2\x80\x9d and a phrase of Grace\r\nFulmer\xe2\x80\x99s that she had but half grasped at the time: \xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nmarried long enough to understand how trifling such things seem in the\r\nbalance of one\xe2\x80\x99s memories.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere were two people who had penetrated farther than she into the\r\nlabyrinth of the wedded state, and struggled through some of\r\nits thorniest passages; and yet both, one consciously, the other\r\nhalf-unaware, testified to the mysterious fact which was already dawning\r\non her: that the influence of a marriage begun in mutual understanding\r\nis too deep not to reassert itself even in the moment of flight and\r\ndenial.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe real reason is that you\xe2\x80\x99re not Nick\xe2\x80\x9d was what she would have said\r\nto Strefford if she had dared to set down the bare truth; and she knew\r\nthat, whatever she wrote, he was too acute not to read that into it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll think it\xe2\x80\x99s because I\xe2\x80\x99m still in love with Nick... and perhaps I\r\nam. But even if I were, the difference doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to lie there, after\r\nall, but deeper, in things we\xe2\x80\x99ve shared that seem to be meant to outlast\r\nlove, or to change it into something different.\xe2\x80\x9d If she could have\r\nhoped to make Strefford understand that, the letter would have been easy\r\nenough to write--but she knew just at what point his imagination would\r\nfail, in what obvious and superficial inferences it would rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Streff--poor me!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought as she sealed the letter.\r\n\r\nAfter she had despatched it a sense of blankness descended on her. She\r\nhad succeeded in driving from her mind all vain hesitations, doubts,\r\nreturns upon herself: her healthy system naturally rejected them. But\r\nthey left a queer emptiness in which her thoughts rattled about as\r\nthoughts might, she supposed, in the first moments after death--before\r\none got used to it. To get used to being dead: that seemed to be her\r\nimmediate business. And she felt such a novice at it--felt so horribly\r\nalive! How had those others learned to do without living? Nelson--well,\r\nhe was still in the throes; and probably never would understand, or\r\nbe able to communicate, the lesson when he had mastered it. But Grace\r\nFulmer--she suddenly remembered that Grace was in Paris, and set forth\r\nto find her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNICK LANSING had walked out a long way into the Campagna. His hours were\r\nseldom his own, for both Mr. and Mrs. Hicks were becoming more and more\r\naddicted to sudden and somewhat imperious demands upon his time; but on\r\nthis occasion he had simply slipped away after luncheon, and taking the\r\ntram to the Porta Salaria, had wandered on thence in the direction of\r\nthe Ponte Nomentano.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to get away and think; but now that he had done it the\r\nbusiness proved as unfruitful as everything he had put his hand to since\r\nhe had left Venice. Think--think about what? His future seemed to him\r\na negligible matter since he had received, two months earlier, the few\r\nlines in which Susy had asked him for her freedom.\r\n\r\nThe letter had been a shock--though he had fancied himself so prepared\r\nfor it--yet it had also, in another sense, been a relief, since, now\r\nthat at last circumstances compelled him to write to her, they also told\r\nhim what to say. And he had said it as briefly and simply as possible,\r\ntelling her that he would put no obstacle in the way of her release,\r\nthat he held himself at her lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s disposal to answer any further\r\ncommunication--and that he would never forget their days together, or\r\ncease to bless her for them.\r\n\r\nThat was all. He gave his Roman banker\xe2\x80\x99s address, and waited for another\r\nletter; but none came. Probably the \xe2\x80\x9cformalities,\xe2\x80\x9d whatever they were,\r\ntook longer than he had supposed; and being in no haste to recover his\r\nown liberty, he did not try to learn the cause of the delay. From that\r\nmoment, however, he considered himself virtually free, and ceased, by\r\nthe same token, to take any interest in his own future. His life seemed\r\nas flat as a convalescent\xe2\x80\x99s first days after the fever has dropped.\r\n\r\nThe only thing he was sure of was that he was not going to remain in\r\nthe Hickses\xe2\x80\x99 employ: when they left Rome for Central Asia he had no\r\nintention of accompanying them. The part of Mr. Buttles\xe2\x80\x99 successor was\r\nbecoming daily more intolerable to him, for the very reasons that had\r\nprobably made it most gratifying to Mr. Buttles. To be treated by Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Hicks as a paid oracle, a paraded and petted piece of property,\r\nwas a good deal more distasteful than he could have imagined any\r\nrelation with these kindly people could be. And since their aspirations\r\nhad become frankly social he found his task, if easier, yet far less\r\ncongenial than during his first months with them. He preferred patiently\r\nexplaining to Mrs. Hicks, for the hundredth time, that Sassanian and\r\nSaracenic were not interchangeable terms, to unravelling for her the\r\ngenealogies of her titled guests, and reminding her, when she \xe2\x80\x9cseated\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n her dinner-parties, that Dukes ranked higher than Princes. No--the job\r\nwas decidedly intolerable; and he would have to look out for another\r\nmeans of earning his living. But that was not what he had really got\r\naway to think about. He knew he should never starve; he had even begun\r\nto believe again in his book. What he wanted to think of was Susy--or\r\nrather, it was Susy that he could not help thinking of, on whatever\r\ntrain of thought he set out.\r\n\r\nAgain and again he fancied he had established a truce with the past: had\r\ncome to terms--the terms of defeat and failure with that bright enemy\r\ncalled happiness. And, in truth, he had reached the point of definitely\r\nknowing that he could never return to the kind of life that he and Susy\r\nhad embarked on. It had been the tragedy, of their relation that loving\r\nher roused in him ideals she could never satisfy. He had fallen in\r\nlove with her because she was, like himself, amused, unprejudiced and\r\ndisenchanted; and he could not go on loving her unless she ceased to\r\nbe all these things. From that circle there was no issue, and in it he\r\ndesperately revolved.\r\n\r\nIf he had not heard such persistent rumours of her re-marriage to Lord\r\nAltringham he might have tried to see her again; but, aware of the\r\ndanger and the hopelessness of a meeting, he was, on the whole, glad to\r\nhave a reason for avoiding it. Such, at least, he honestly supposed to\r\nbe his state of mind until he found himself, as on this occasion, free\r\nto follow out his thought to its end. That end, invariably, was Susy;\r\nnot the bundle of qualities and defects into which his critical\r\nspirit had tried to sort her out, but the soft blur of identity, of\r\npersonality, of eyes, hair, mouth, laugh, tricks of speech and gesture,\r\nthat were all so solely and profoundly her own, and yet so mysteriously\r\nindependent of what she might do, say, think, in crucial circumstances.\r\nHe remembered her once saying to him: \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, you were right\r\nwhen you wanted me to be your mistress,\xe2\x80\x9d and the indignant stare of\r\nincredulity with which he had answered her. Yet in these hours it\r\nwas the palpable image of her that clung closest, till, as invariably\r\nhappened, his vision came full circle, and feeling her on his breast he\r\nwanted her also in his soul.\r\n\r\nWell--such all-encompassing loves were the rarest of human experiences;\r\nhe smiled at his presumption in wanting no other. Wearily he turned, and\r\ntramped homeward through the winter twilight....\r\n\r\nAt the door of the hotel he ran across the Prince of Teutoburg\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naide-de-camp. They had not met for some days, and Nick had a vague\r\nfeeling that if the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s matrimonial designs took definite shape he\r\nhimself was not likely, after all, to be their chosen exponent. He\r\nhad surprised, now and then, a certain distrustful coldness under the\r\nPrincess Mother\xe2\x80\x99s cordial glance, and had concluded that she perhaps\r\nsuspected him of being an obstacle to her son\xe2\x80\x99s aspirations. He had no\r\nidea of playing that part, but was not sorry to appear to; for he was\r\nsincerely attached to Coral Hicks, and hoped for her a more human fate\r\nthan that of becoming Prince Anastasius\xe2\x80\x99s consort.\r\n\r\nThis evening, however, he was struck by the beaming alacrity of the\r\naide-de-camp\xe2\x80\x99s greeting. Whatever cloud had hung between them had\r\nlifted: the Teutoburg clan, for one reason or another, no longer feared\r\nor distrusted him. The change was conveyed in a mere hand-pressure,\r\na brief exchange of words, for the aide-de-camp was hastening after a\r\nwell-known dowager of the old Roman world, whom he helped into a large\r\ncoronetted brougham which looked as if it had been extracted, for\r\nsome ceremonial purpose, from a museum of historic vehicles. And in an\r\ninstant it flashed on Lansing that this lady had been the person chosen\r\nto lay the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s offer at Miss Hicks\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\r\n\r\nThe discovery piqued him; and instead of making straight for his own\r\nroom he went up to Mrs. Hicks\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room.\r\n\r\nThe room was empty, but traces of elaborate tea pervaded it, and an\r\nimmense bouquet of stiff roses lay on the centre table. As he turned\r\naway, Eldorada Tooker, flushed and tear-stained, abruptly entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Lansing--we were looking everywhere for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLooking for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Coral especially... she wants to see you. She wants you to come to\r\nher own sitting-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe led him across the ante-chamber and down the passage to the separate\r\nsuite which Miss Hicks inhabited. On the threshold Eldorada gasped out\r\nemotionally: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find her looking lovely--\xe2\x80\x9d and jerked away with a\r\nsob as he entered.\r\n\r\nCoral Hicks was never lovely: but she certainly looked unusually\r\nhandsome. Perhaps it was the long dress of black velvet which, outlined\r\nagainst a shaded lamp, made her strong build seem slenderer, or perhaps\r\nthe slight flush on her dusky cheek: a bloom of womanhood hung upon\r\nher which she made no effort to dissemble. Indeed, it was one of her\r\noriginalities that she always gravely and courageously revealed the\r\nutmost of whatever mood possessed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow splendid you look!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling at her.\r\n\r\nShe threw her head back and gazed him straight in the eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoing to be my future job.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo look splendid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd wear a crown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd wear a crown....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey continued to consider each other without speaking. Nick\xe2\x80\x99s heart\r\ncontracted with pity and perplexity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Coral--it\xe2\x80\x99s not decided?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe scrutinized him for a last penetrating moment; then she looked away.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m never long deciding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, choking with contradictory impulses, and afraid to\r\nformulate any, lest they should either mislead or pain her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d he questioned lamely; and instantly perceived\r\nhis blunder.\r\n\r\nShe sat down, and looked up at him under brooding lashes--had he ever\r\nnoticed the thickness of her lashes before?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould it have made any difference if I had told you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny difference--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down by me,\xe2\x80\x9d she commanded. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to talk to you. You can say\r\nnow whatever you might have said sooner. I\xe2\x80\x99m not married yet: I\xe2\x80\x99m still\r\nfree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t given your answer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe retort frightened him with the glimpse of what she still expected of\r\nhim, and what he was still so unable to give.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat means you\xe2\x80\x99ve said yes?\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, to gain time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes or no--it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. I had to say something. What I want is\r\nyour advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the eleventh hour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr the twelfth.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I do?\xe2\x80\x9d she questioned, with a\r\nsudden accent of helplessness.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her as helplessly. He could not say: \xe2\x80\x9cAsk yourself--ask\r\nyour parents.\xe2\x80\x9d Her next word would sweep away such frail hypocrisies.\r\nHer \xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I do?\xe2\x80\x9d meant \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d and he knew it,\r\nand knew that she knew it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a bad person to give any one matrimonial advice,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, with a\r\nstrained smile; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I had such a different vision for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of a vision?\xe2\x80\x9d She was merciless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMerely what people call happiness, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98People call\xe2\x80\x99--you see you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in it yourself! Well, neither\r\ndo I--in that form, at any rate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe considered. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe in trying for it--even if the trying\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nbest of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried, and failed. And I\xe2\x80\x99m twenty-two, and I never was\r\nyoung. I suppose I haven\xe2\x80\x99t enough imagination.\xe2\x80\x9d She drew a deep breath.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I want something different.\xe2\x80\x9d She appeared to search for the word.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to be--prominent,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProminent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe reddened swarthily. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you smile--you think it\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous: it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem worth while to you. That\xe2\x80\x99s because you\xe2\x80\x99ve always had all\r\nthose things. But I haven\xe2\x80\x99t. I know what father pushed up from, and\r\nI want to push up as high again--higher. No, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got much\r\nimagination. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked Facts. And I find I shall like the fact\r\nof being a Princess--choosing the people I associate with, and being up\r\nabove all these European grandees that father and mother bow down to,\r\nthough they think they despise them. You can be up above these people by\r\njust being yourself; you know how. But I need a platform--a sky-scraper.\r\nFather and mother slaved to give me my education. They thought education\r\nwas the important thing; but, since we\xe2\x80\x99ve all three of us got mediocre\r\nminds, it has just landed us among mediocre people. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you suppose I\r\nsee through all the sham science and sham art and sham everything we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nsurrounded with? That\xe2\x80\x99s why I want to buy a place at the very top, where\r\nI shall be powerful enough to get about me the people I want, the big\r\npeople, the right people, and to help them I want to promote culture,\r\nlike those Renaissance women you\xe2\x80\x99re always talking about. I want to do\r\nit for Apex City; do you understand? And for father and mother too. I\r\nwant all those titles carved on my tombstone. They\xe2\x80\x99re facts, anyhow!\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t laugh at me....\xe2\x80\x9d She broke off with one of her clumsy smiles, and\r\nmoved away from him to the other end of the room.\r\n\r\nHe sat looking at her with a curious feeling of admiration. Her harsh\r\npositivism was like a tonic to his disenchanted mood, and he thought:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAloud he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like laughing at you. You\xe2\x80\x99re a great\r\nwoman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I shall be a great Princess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh--but you might have been something so much greater!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer face flamed again. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood up involuntarily, and drew near her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you\xe2\x80\x99re the only man with whom I can imagine the other kind of\r\ngreatness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt moved him--moved him unexpectedly. He got as far as saying to\r\nhimself: \xe2\x80\x9cGood God, if she were not so hideously rich--\xe2\x80\x9d and then of\r\nyielding for a moment to the persuasive vision of all that he and she\r\nmight do with those very riches which he dreaded. After all, there was\r\nnothing mean in her ideals they were hard and material, in keeping with\r\nher primitive and massive person; but they had a certain grim nobility.\r\nAnd when she spoke of \xe2\x80\x9cthe other kind of greatness\xe2\x80\x9d he knew that she\r\nunderstood what she was talking of, and was not merely saying something\r\nto draw him on, to get him to commit himself. There was not a drop of\r\nguile in her, except that which her very honesty distilled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe other kind of greatness?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that what you said happiness was? I wanted to be happy...\r\nbut one can\xe2\x80\x99t choose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went up to her. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, one can\xe2\x80\x99t choose. And how can anyone give you\r\nhappiness who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got it himself?\xe2\x80\x9d He took her hands, feeling how\r\nlarge, muscular and voluntary they were, even as they melted in his\r\npalms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor Coral, of what use can I ever be to you? What you need is to be\r\nloved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe drew back and gave him one of her straight strong glances: \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid gallantly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut just to love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\nIN the persistent drizzle of a Paris winter morning Susy Lansing walked\r\nback alone from the school at which she had just deposited the four\r\neldest Fulmers to the little house in Passy where, for the last two\r\nmonths, she had been living with them.\r\n\r\nShe had on ready-made boots, an old waterproof and a last year\xe2\x80\x99s hat;\r\nbut none of these facts disturbed her, though she took no particular\r\npride in them. The truth was that she was too busy to think much about\r\nthem. Since she had assumed the charge of the Fulmer children, in the\r\nabsence of both their parents in Italy, she had had to pass through such\r\nan arduous apprenticeship of motherhood that every moment of her waking\r\nhours was packed with things to do at once, and other things to remember\r\nto do later. There were only five Fulmers; but at times they were\r\nlike an army with banners, and their power of self-multiplication was\r\nequalled only by the manner in which they could dwindle, vanish, grow\r\nmute, and become as it were a single tumbled brown head bent over a book\r\nin some corner of the house in which nobody would ever have thought of\r\nhunting for them--and which, of course, were it the bonne\xe2\x80\x99s room in the\r\nattic, or the subterranean closet where the trunks were kept, had been\r\nsingled out by them for that very reason.\r\n\r\nThese changes from ubiquity to invisibility would have seemed to Susy,\r\na few months earlier, one of the most maddening of many characteristics\r\nnot calculated to promote repose. But now she felt differently. She\r\nhad grown interested in her charges, and the search for a clue to their\r\nmethods, whether tribal or individual, was as exciting to her as the\r\ndevelopment of a detective story.\r\n\r\nWhat interested her most in the whole stirring business was the\r\ndiscovery that they had a method. These little creatures, pitched upward\r\ninto experience on the tossing waves of their parents\xe2\x80\x99 agitated lives,\r\nhad managed to establish a rough-and-ready system of self-government.\r\nJunie, the eldest (the one who already chose her mother\xe2\x80\x99s hats, and\r\ntried to put order in her wardrobe) was the recognized head of the\r\nstate. At twelve she knew lots of things which her mother had never\r\nthoroughly learned, and Susy, her temporary mother, had never even\r\nguessed at: she spoke with authority on all vital subjects, from\r\ncastor-oil to flannel under-clothes, from the fair sharing of stamps\r\nor marbles to the number of helpings of rice-pudding or jam which each\r\nchild was entitled to.\r\n\r\nThere was hardly any appeal from her verdict; yet each of her subjects\r\nrevolved in his or her own orbit of independence, according to laws\r\nwhich Junie acknowledged and respected; and the interpreting of this\r\nmysterious charter of rights and privileges had not been without\r\ndifficulty for Susy.\r\n\r\nBesides this, there were material difficulties to deal with. The six of\r\nthem, and the breathless bonne who cooked and slaved for them all, had\r\nbut a slim budget to live on; and, as Junie remarked, you\xe2\x80\x99d have thought\r\nthe boys ate their shoes, the way they vanished. They ate, certainly, a\r\ngreat deal else, and mostly of a nourishing and expensive kind. They\r\nhad definite views about the amount and quality of their food, and were\r\ncapable of concerted rebellion when Susy\xe2\x80\x99s catering fell beneath their\r\nstandard. All this made her life a hurried and harassing business, but\r\nnever--what she had most feared it would be a dull or depressing one.\r\n\r\nIt was not, she owned to herself, that the society of the Fulmer\r\nchildren had roused in her any abstract passion for the human young. She\r\nknew--had known since Nick\xe2\x80\x99s first kiss--how she would love any child of\r\nhis and hers; and she had cherished poor little Clarissa Vanderlyn with\r\na shrinking and wistful solicitude. But in these rough young Fulmers she\r\ntook a positive delight, and for reasons that were increasingly clear to\r\nher. It was because, in the first place, they were all intelligent; and\r\nbecause their intelligence had been fed only on things worth caring for.\r\nHowever inadequate Grace Fulmer\xe2\x80\x99s bringing-up of her increasing tribe\r\nhad been, they had heard in her company nothing trivial or dull: good\r\nmusic, good books and good talk had been their daily food, and if at\r\ntimes they stamped and roared and crashed about like children unblessed\r\nby such privileges, at others they shone with the light of poetry and\r\nspoke with the voice of wisdom.\r\n\r\nThat had been Susy\xe2\x80\x99s discovery: for the first time she was among\r\nawakening minds which had been wakened only to beauty. From their\r\ncramped and uncomfortable household Grace and Nat Fulmer had managed to\r\nkeep out mean envies, vulgar admirations, shabby discontents; above all\r\nthe din and confusion the great images of beauty had brooded, like those\r\nancestral figures that stood apart on their shelf in the poorest Roman\r\nhouseholds.\r\n\r\nNo, the task she had undertaken for want of a better gave Susy no sense\r\nof a missed vocation: \xe2\x80\x9cmothering\xe2\x80\x9d on a large scale would never, she\r\nperceived, be her job. Rather it gave her, in odd ways, the sense\r\nof being herself mothered, of taking her first steps in the life of\r\nimmaterial values which had begun to seem so much more substantial than\r\nany she had known.\r\n\r\nOn the day when she had gone to Grace Fulmer for counsel and comfort\r\nshe had little guessed that they would come to her in this form. She had\r\nfound her friend, more than ever distracted and yet buoyant, riding the\r\nlarge untidy waves of her life with the splashed ease of an amphibian.\r\nGrace was probably the only person among Susy\xe2\x80\x99s friends who could have\r\nunderstood why she could not make up her mind to marry Altringham; but\r\nat the moment Grace was too much absorbed in her own problems to\r\npay much attention to her friend\xe2\x80\x99s, and, according to her wont, she\r\nimmediately \xe2\x80\x9cunpacked\xe2\x80\x9d her difficulties.\r\n\r\nNat was not getting what she had hoped out of his European opportunity.\r\nOh, she was enough of an artist herself to know that there must be\r\nfallow periods--that the impact of new impressions seldom produced\r\nimmediate results. She had allowed for all that. But her past experience\r\nof Nat\xe2\x80\x99s moods had taught her to know just when he was assimilating,\r\nwhen impressions were fructifying in him. And now they were not, and he\r\nknew it as well as she did. There had been too much rushing about, too\r\nmuch excitement and sterile flattery... Mrs. Melrose? Well, yes, for\r\na while... the trip to Spain had been a love-journey, no doubt. Grace\r\nspoke calmly, but the lines of her face sharpened: she had suffered, oh\r\nhorribly, at his going to Spain without her. Yet she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, for the\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s sake, afford to miss the big sum that Ursula Gillow had given\r\nher for her fortnight at Ruan. And her playing had struck people, and\r\nled, on the way back, to two or three profitable engagements in private\r\nhouses in London. Fashionable society had made \xe2\x80\x9ca little fuss\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n about her, and it had surprised and pleased Nat, and given her a new\r\nimportance in his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was beginning to forget that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t only\r\na nursery-maid, and it\xe2\x80\x99s been a good thing for him to be reminded...\r\nbut the great thing is that with what I\xe2\x80\x99ve earned he and I can go off\r\nto southern Italy and Sicily for three months. You know I know how\r\nto manage... and, alone with me, Nat will settle down to work: to\r\nobserving, feeling, soaking things in. It\xe2\x80\x99s the only way. Mrs. Melrose\r\nwants to take him, to pay all the expenses again--well she shan\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\npay them.\xe2\x80\x9d Her worn cheek flushed with triumph. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ll see what\r\nwonders will come of it.... Only there\xe2\x80\x99s the problem of the children.\r\nJunie quite agrees that we can\xe2\x80\x99t take them....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereupon she had unfolded her idea. If Susy was at a loose end, and\r\nhard up, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she take charge of the children while their\r\nparents were in Italy? For three months at most--Grace could promise it\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be longer. They couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pay her much, of course, but at least\r\nshe would be lodged and fed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, you know, it will end by interesting\r\nyou--I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it will,\xe2\x80\x9d the mother concluded, her irrepressible\r\nhopefulness rising even to this height, while Susy stood before her with\r\na hesitating smile.\r\n\r\nTake care of five Fulmers for three months! The prospect cowed her. If\r\nthere had been only Junie and Geordie, the oldest and youngest of the\r\nband, she might have felt less hesitation. But there was Nat, the second\r\nin age, whose motor-horn had driven her and Nick out to the hill-side\r\non their fatal day at the Fulmers\xe2\x80\x99 and there were the twins, Jack and\r\nPeggy, of whom she had kept memories almost equally disquieting. To rule\r\nthis uproarious tribe would be a sterner business than trying to beguile\r\nClarissa Vanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s ladylike leisure; and she would have refused on the\r\nspot, as she had refused once before, if the only possible alternatives\r\nhad not come to seem so much less bearable, and if Junie, called in for\r\nadvice, and standing there, small, plain and competent, had not said\r\nin her quiet grown-up voice: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Mrs. Lansing and I can\r\nmanage while you\xe2\x80\x99re away--especially if she reads aloud well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReads aloud well! The stipulation had enchanted Susy. She had never\r\nbefore known children who cared to be read aloud to; she remembered with\r\na shiver her attempts to interest Clarissa in anything but gossip\r\nand the fashions, and the tone in which the child had said, showing\r\nStrefford\xe2\x80\x99s trinket to her father: \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I said I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have it\r\nthan a book.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd here were children who consented to be left for three months by\r\ntheir parents, but on condition that a good reader was provided for\r\nthem!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well--I will! But what shall I be expected to read to you?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nhad gaily questioned; and Junie had answered, after one of her sober\r\npauses of reflection: \xe2\x80\x9cThe little ones like nearly everything; but Nat\r\nand I want poetry particularly, because if we read it to ourselves we so\r\noften pronounce the puzzling words wrong, and then it sounds so horrid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I hope I shall pronounce them right,\xe2\x80\x9d Susy murmured, stricken with\r\nself-distrust and humility.\r\n\r\nApparently she did; for her reading was a success, and even the twins\r\nand Geordie, once they had grown used to her, seemed to prefer a ringing\r\npage of Henry V, or the fairy scenes from the Midsummer Night\xe2\x80\x99s Dream,\r\nto their own more specialized literature, though that had also at times\r\nto be provided.\r\n\r\nThere were, in fact, no lulls in her life with the Fulmers; but\r\nits commotions seemed to Susy less meaningless, and therefore less\r\nfatiguing, than those that punctuated the existence of people like\r\nAltringham, Ursula Gillow, Ellie Vanderlyn and their train; and the\r\nnoisy uncomfortable little house at Passy was beginning to greet her\r\nwith the eyes of home when she returned there after her tramps to and\r\nfrom the children\xe2\x80\x99s classes. At any rate she had the sense of doing\r\nsomething useful and even necessary, and of earning her own keep, though\r\non so modest a scale; and when the children were in their quiet\r\nmood, and demanded books or music (or, even, on one occasion, at the\r\nsurprising Junie\xe2\x80\x99s instigation, a collective visit to the Louvre, where\r\nthey recognized the most unlikely pictures, and the two elders emitted\r\nstartling technical judgments, and called their companion\xe2\x80\x99s attention to\r\ndetails she had not observed); on these occasions, Susy had a surprised\r\nsense of being drawn back into her brief life with Nick, or even still\r\nfarther and deeper, into those visions of Nick\xe2\x80\x99s own childhood on which\r\nthe trivial later years had heaped their dust.\r\n\r\nIt was curious to think that if he and she had remained together, and\r\nshe had had a child--the vision used to come to her, in her sleepless\r\nhours, when she looked at little Geordie, in his cot by her bed--their\r\nlife together might have been very much like the life she was now\r\nleading, a small obscure business to the outer world, but to themselves\r\nhow wide and deep and crowded!\r\n\r\nShe could not bear, at that moment, the thought of giving up this mystic\r\nrelation to the life she had missed. In spite of the hurry and fatigue\r\nof her days, the shabbiness and discomfort of everything, and the hours\r\nwhen the children were as \xe2\x80\x9chorrid\xe2\x80\x9d as any other children, and turned a\r\nconspiracy of hostile faces to all her appeals; in spite of all this\r\nshe did not want to give them up, and had decided, when their parents\r\nreturned, to ask to go back to America with them. Perhaps, if Nat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuccess continued, and Grace was able to work at her music, they would\r\nneed a kind of governess-companion. At any rate, she could picture no\r\nfuture less distasteful.\r\n\r\nShe had not sent to Mr. Spearman Nick\xe2\x80\x99s answer to her letter. In the\r\ninterval between writing to him and receiving his reply she had broken\r\nwith Strefford; she had therefore no object in seeking her freedom. If\r\nNick wanted his, he knew he had only to ask for it; and his silence, as\r\nthe weeks passed, woke a faint hope in her. The hope flamed high when\r\nshe read one day in the newspapers a vague but evidently \xe2\x80\x9cinspired\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n allusion to the possibility of an alliance between his Serene Highness\r\nthe reigning Prince of Teutoburg-Waldhain and Miss Coral Hicks of\r\nApex City; it sank to ashes when, a few days later, her eye lit on a\r\nparagraph wherein Mr. and Mrs. Mortimer Hicks \xe2\x80\x9crequested to state\xe2\x80\x9d that\r\nthere was no truth in the report.\r\n\r\nOn the foundation of these two statements Susy raised one watch-tower\r\nof hope after another, feverish edifices demolished or rebuilt by every\r\nchance hint from the outer world wherein Nick\xe2\x80\x99s name figured with the\r\nHickses\xe2\x80\x99. And still, as the days passed and she heard nothing, either\r\nfrom him or from her lawyer, her flag continued to fly from the quaking\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\nApart from the custody of the children there was indeed little to\r\ndistract her mind from these persistent broodings. She winced sometimes\r\nat the thought of the ease with which her fashionable friends had let\r\nher drop out of sight. In the perpetual purposeless rush of their days,\r\nthe feverish making of winter plans, hurrying off to the Riviera or St.\r\nMoritz, Egypt or New York, there was no time to hunt up the vanished\r\nor to wait for the laggard. Had they learned that she had broken her\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cengagement\xe2\x80\x9d (how she hated the word!) to Strefford, and had the fact\r\ngone about that she was once more only a poor hanger-on, to be taken up\r\nwhen it was convenient, and ignored in the intervals? She did not know;\r\nthough she fancied Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s newly-developed pride would prevent his\r\nrevealing to any one what had passed between them. For several days\r\nafter her abrupt flight he had made no sign; and though she longed to\r\nwrite and ask his forgiveness she could not find the words. Finally it\r\nwas he who wrote: a short note, from Altringham, typical of all that was\r\nbest in the old Strefford. He had gone down to Altringham, he told her,\r\nto think quietly over their last talk, and try to understand what\r\nshe had been driving at. He had to own that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t; but that, he\r\nsupposed, was the very head and front of his offending. Whatever he had\r\ndone to displease her, he was sorry for; but he asked, in view of his\r\ninvincible ignorance, to be allowed not to regard his offence as a cause\r\nfor a final break. The possibility of that, he found, would make him\r\neven more unhappy than he had foreseen; as she knew, his own happiness\r\nhad always been his first object in life, and he therefore begged her to\r\nsuspend her decision a little longer. He expected to be in Paris within\r\nanother two months, and before arriving he would write again, and ask\r\nher to see him.\r\n\r\nThe letter moved her but did not make her waver. She simply wrote that\r\nshe was touched by his kindness, and would willingly see him if he came\r\nto Paris later; though she was bound to tell him that she had not yet\r\nchanged her mind, and did not believe it would promote his happiness to\r\nhave her try to do so.\r\n\r\nHe did not reply to this, and there was nothing further to keep her\r\nthoughts from revolving endlessly about her inmost hopes and fears.\r\n\r\nOn the rainy afternoon in question, tramping home from the \xe2\x80\x9ccours\xe2\x80\x9d (to\r\nwhich she was to return at six), she had said to herself that it was\r\ntwo months that very day since Nick had known she was ready to release\r\nhim--and that after such a delay he was not likely to take any further\r\nsteps. The thought filled her with a vague ecstasy. She had had to fix\r\nan arbitrary date as the term of her anguish, and she had fixed that\r\none; and behold she was justified. For what could his silence mean but\r\nthat he too....\r\n\r\nOn the hall-table lay a typed envelope with the Paris postage-mark. She\r\nopened it carelessly, and saw that the letter-head bore Mr. Spearman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noffice address. The words beneath spun round before her eyes.... \xe2\x80\x9cHas\r\nnotified us that he is at your disposal... carry out your wishes...\r\narriving in Paris... fix an appointment with his lawyers....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNick--it was Nick the words were talking of! It was the fact of Nick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreturn to Paris that was being described in those preposterous terms!\r\nShe sank down on the bench beside the dripping umbrella-stand and stared\r\nvacantly before her. It had fallen at last--this blow in which she now\r\nsaw that she had never really believed! And yet she had imagined she was\r\nprepared for it, had expected it, was already planning her future life\r\nin view of it--an effaced impersonal life in the service of somebody\r\nelse\xe2\x80\x99s children--when, in reality, under that thin surface of abnegation\r\nand acceptance, all the old hopes had been smouldering red-hot in their\r\nashes! What was the use of any self-discipline, any philosophy, any\r\nexperience, if the lawless self underneath could in an instant consume\r\nthem like tinder?\r\n\r\nShe tried to collect herself--to understand what had happened. Nick was\r\ncoming to Paris--coming not to see her but to consult his lawyer! It\r\nmeant, of course, that he had definitely resolved to claim his freedom;\r\nand that, if he had made up his mind to this final step, after more\r\nthan six months of inaction and seeming indifference, it could be\r\nonly because something unforeseen and decisive had happened to him.\r\nFeverishly, she put together again the stray scraps of gossip and the\r\nnewspaper paragraphs that had reached her in the last months. It\r\nwas evident that Miss Hicks\xe2\x80\x99s projected marriage with the Prince of\r\nTeutoburg-Waldhain had been broken off at the last moment; and broken\r\noff because she intended to marry Nick. The announcement of his arrival\r\nin Paris and the publication of Mr. and Mrs. Hicks\xe2\x80\x99s formal denial of\r\ntheir daughter\xe2\x80\x99s betrothal coincided too closely to admit of any other\r\ninference. Susy tried to grasp the reality of these assembled facts, to\r\npicture to herself their actual tangible results. She thought of Coral\r\nHicks bearing the name of Mrs. Nick Lansing--her name, Susy\xe2\x80\x99s own!--and\r\nentering drawing-rooms with Nick in her wake, gaily welcomed by the very\r\npeople who, a few months before, had welcomed Susy with the same warmth.\r\nIn spite of Nick\xe2\x80\x99s growing dislike of society, and Coral\xe2\x80\x99s attitude of\r\nintellectual superiority, their wealth would fatally draw them back into\r\nthe world to which Nick was attached by all his habits and associations.\r\nAnd no doubt it would amuse him to re-enter that world as a dispenser of\r\nhospitality, to play the part of host where he had so long been a guest;\r\njust as Susy had once fancied it would amuse her to re-enter it as Lady\r\nAltringham.... But, try as she would, now that the reality was so close\r\non her, she could not visualize it or relate it to herself. The mere\r\njuxtaposition of the two names--Coral, Nick--which in old times she had\r\nso often laughingly coupled, now produced a blur in her brain.\r\n\r\nShe continued to sit helplessly beside the hall-table, the tears running\r\ndown her cheeks. The appearance of the bonne aroused her. Her youngest\r\ncharge, Geordie, had been feverish for a day or two; he was better,\r\nbut still confined to the nursery, and he had heard Susy unlock the\r\nhouse-door, and could not imagine why she had not come straight up to\r\nhim. He now began to manifest his indignation in a series of racking\r\nhowls, and Susy, shaken out of her trance, dropped her cloak and\r\numbrella and hurried up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that child!\xe2\x80\x9d she groaned.\r\n\r\nUnder the Fulmer roof there was little time or space for the indulgence\r\nof private sorrows. From morning till night there was always some\r\nimmediate practical demand on one\xe2\x80\x99s attention; and Susy was beginning\r\nto see how, in contracted households, children may play a part less\r\nromantic but not less useful than that assigned to them in fiction,\r\nthrough the mere fact of giving their parents no leisure to dwell on\r\nirremediable grievances. Though her own apprenticeship to family life\r\nhad been so short, she had already acquired the knack of rapid mental\r\nreadjustment, and as she hurried up to the nursery her private cares\r\nwere dispelled by a dozen problems of temperature, diet and medicine.\r\n\r\nSuch readjustment was of course only momentary; yet each time it\r\nhappened it seemed to give her more firmness and flexibility of temper.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a child I was myself six months ago!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, wondering that\r\nNick\xe2\x80\x99s influence, and the tragedy of their parting, should have done\r\nless to mature and steady her than these few weeks in a house full of\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nPacifying Geordie was not easy, for he had long since learned to use\r\nhis grievances as a pretext for keeping the offender at his beck with a\r\ncontinuous supply of stories, songs and games. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better be careful\r\nnever to put yourself in the wrong with Geordie,\xe2\x80\x9d the astute Junie had\r\nwarned Susy at the outset, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause he\xe2\x80\x99s got such a memory, and he won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake it up with you till you\xe2\x80\x99ve told him every fairy-tale he\xe2\x80\x99s ever\r\nheard before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut on this occasion, as soon as he saw her, Geordie\xe2\x80\x99s indignation\r\nmelted. She was still in the doorway, compunctious, abject and racking\r\nher dazed brain for his favourite stories, when she saw, by the\r\nsmoothing out of his mouth and the sudden serenity of his eyes, that he\r\nwas going to give her the delicious but not wholly reassuring shock of\r\nbeing a good boy.\r\n\r\nThoughtfully he examined her face as she knelt down beside the cot; then\r\nhe poked out a finger and pressed it on her tearful cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Susy got a pain too,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, putting his arms about her; and\r\nas she hugged him close, he added philosophically: \xe2\x80\x9cTell Geordie a new\r\nstory, darling, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll forget all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNICK Lansing arrived in Paris two days after his lawyer had announced\r\nhis coming to Mr. Spearman.\r\n\r\nHe had left Rome with the definite purpose of freeing himself and Susy;\r\nand though he was not pledged to Coral Hicks he had not concealed from\r\nher the object of his journey. In vain had he tried to rouse in himself\r\nany sense of interest in his own future. Beyond the need of reaching a\r\ndefinite point in his relation to Susy his imagination could not travel.\r\nBut he had been moved by Coral\xe2\x80\x99s confession, and his reason told him\r\nthat he and she would probably be happy together, with the temperate\r\nhappiness based on a community of tastes and an enlargement of\r\nopportunities. He meant, on his return to Rome, to ask her to marry\r\nhim; and he knew that she knew it. Indeed, if he had not spoken before\r\nleaving it was with no idea of evading his fate, or keeping her longer\r\nin suspense, but simply because of the strange apathy that had fallen\r\non him since he had received Susy\xe2\x80\x99s letter. In his incessant\r\nself-communings he dressed up this apathy as a discretion which forbade\r\nhis engaging Coral\xe2\x80\x99s future till his own was assured. But in truth he\r\nknew that Coral\xe2\x80\x99s future was already engaged, and his with it: in Rome\r\nthe fact had seemed natural and even inevitable.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, it instantly became the thinnest of unrealities. Not because\r\nParis was not Rome, nor because it was Paris; but because hidden away\r\nsomewhere in that vast unheeding labyrinth was the half-forgotten part\r\nof himself that was Susy.... For weeks, for months past, his mind had\r\nbeen saturated with Susy: she had never seemed more insistently near him\r\nthan as their separation lengthened, and the chance of reunion became\r\nless probable. It was as if a sickness long smouldering in him had\r\nbroken out and become acute, enveloping him in the Nessus-shirt of his\r\nmemories. There were moments when, to his memory, their actual embraces\r\nseemed perfunctory, accidental, compared with this deep deliberate\r\nimprint of her soul on his.\r\n\r\nYet now it had become suddenly different. Now that he was in the same\r\nplace with her, and might at any moment run across her, meet her eyes,\r\nhear her voice, avoid her hand--now that penetrating ghost of her\r\nwith which he had been living was sucked back into the shadows, and\r\nhe seemed, for the first time since their parting, to be again in her\r\nactual presence. He woke to the fact on the morning of his arrival,\r\nstaring down from his hotel window on a street she would perhaps walk\r\nthrough that very day, and over a limitless huddle of roofs, one\r\nof which covered her at that hour. The abruptness of the transition\r\nstartled him; he had not known that her mere geographical nearness would\r\ntake him by the throat in that way. What would it be, then, if she were\r\nto walk into the room?\r\n\r\nThank heaven that need never happen! He was sufficiently informed as\r\nto French divorce proceedings to know that they would not necessitate\r\na confrontation with his wife; and with ordinary luck, and some\r\nprecautions, he might escape even a distant glimpse of her. He did not\r\nmean to remain in Paris more than a few days; and during that time it\r\nwould be easy--knowing, as he did, her tastes and Altringham\xe2\x80\x99s--to avoid\r\nthe places where she was likely to be met. He did not know where she was\r\nliving, but imagined her to be staying with Mrs. Melrose, or some other\r\nrich friend, or else lodged, in prospective affluence, at the Nouveau\r\nLuxe, or in a pretty flat of her own. Trust Susy--ah, the pang of it--to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmanage\xe2\x80\x9d!\r\n\r\nHis first visit was to his lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s; and as he walked through the\r\nfamiliar streets each approaching face, each distant figure seemed\r\nhers. The obsession was intolerable. It would not last, of course; but\r\nmeanwhile he had the exposed sense of a fugitive in a nightmare, who\r\nfeels himself the only creature visible in a ghostly and besetting\r\nmultitude. The eye of the metropolis seemed fixed on him in an immense\r\nunblinking stare.\r\n\r\nAt the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s he was told that, as a first step to freedom, he must\r\nsecure a domicile in Paris. He had of course known of this necessity: he\r\nhad seen too many friends through the Divorce Court, in one country\r\nor another, not to be fairly familiar with the procedure. But the fact\r\npresented a different aspect as soon as he tried to relate it to himself\r\nand Susy: it was as though Susy\xe2\x80\x99s personality were a medium through\r\nwhich events still took on a transfiguring colour. He found the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdomicile\xe2\x80\x9d that very day: a tawdrily furnished rez-de-chaussee,\r\nobviously destined to far different uses. And as he sat there, after the\r\nconcierge had discreetly withdrawn with the first quarter\xe2\x80\x99s payment in\r\nher pocket, and stared about him at the vulgar plushy place, he burst\r\nout laughing at what it was about to figure in the eyes of the law: a\r\nHome, and a Home desecrated by his own act! The Home in which he and\r\nSusy had reared their precarious bliss, and seen it crumble at the\r\nbrutal touch of his unfaithfulness and his cruelty--for he had been told\r\nthat he must be cruel to her as well as unfaithful! He looked at the\r\nwalls hung with sentimental photogravures, at the shiny bronze \xe2\x80\x9cnudes,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n the moth-eaten animal-skins and the bedizened bed--and once more the\r\nunreality, the impossibility, of all that was happening to him entered\r\nlike a drug into his veins.\r\n\r\nTo rouse himself he stood up, turned the key on the hideous place, and\r\nreturned to his lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s. He knew that in the hard dry atmosphere of the\r\noffice the act of giving the address of the flat would restore some kind\r\nof reality to the phantasmal transaction. And with wonder he watched the\r\nlawyer, as a matter of course, pencil the street and the number on one\r\nof the papers enclosed in a folder on which his own name was elaborately\r\nengrossed.\r\n\r\nAs he took leave it occurred to him to ask where Susy was living. At\r\nleast he imagined that it had just occurred to him, and that he was\r\nmaking the enquiry merely as a measure of precaution, in order to know\r\nwhat quarter of Paris to avoid; but in reality the question had been on\r\nhis lips since he had first entered the office, and lurking in his mind\r\nsince he had emerged from the railway station that morning. The fact\r\nof not knowing where she lived made the whole of Paris a meaningless\r\nunintelligible place, as useless to him as the face of a huge clock that\r\nhas lost its hour hand.\r\n\r\nThe address in Passy surprised him: he had imagined that she would be\r\nsomewhere in the neighborhood of the Champs Elysees or the Place de\r\nl\xe2\x80\x99Etoile. But probably either Mrs. Melrose or Ellie Vanderlyn had taken\r\na house at Passy. Well--it was something of a relief to know that she\r\nwas so far off. No business called him to that almost suburban region\r\nbeyond the Trocadero, and there was much less chance of meeting her than\r\nif she had been in the centre of Paris.\r\n\r\nAll day he wandered, avoiding the fashionable quarters, the streets\r\nin which private motors glittered five deep, and furred and feathered\r\nsilhouettes glided from them into tea-rooms, picture-galleries and\r\njewellers\xe2\x80\x99 shops. In some such scenes Susy was no doubt figuring:\r\nslenderer, finer, vivider, than the other images of clay, but imitating\r\ntheir gestures, chattering their jargon, winding her hand among the same\r\npearls and sables. He struck away across the Seine, along the quays\r\nto the Cite, the net-work of old Paris, the great grey vaults of St.\r\nEustache, the swarming streets of the Marais. He gazed at monuments\r\ndawdled before shop-windows, sat in squares and on quays, watching\r\npeople bargain, argue, philander, quarrel, work-girls stroll past in\r\nlinked bands, beggars whine on the bridges, derelicts doze in the pale\r\nwinter sun, mothers in mourning hasten by taking children to school, and\r\nstreet-walkers beat their weary rounds before the cafes.\r\n\r\nThe day drifted on. Toward evening he began to grow afraid of his\r\nsolitude, and to think of dining at the Nouveau Luxe, or some\r\nother fashionable restaurant where he would be fairly sure to\r\nmeet acquaintances, and be carried off to a theatre, a boite or a\r\ndancing-hall. Anything, anything now, to get away from the maddening\r\nround of his thoughts. He felt the same blank fear of solitude as months\r\nago in Genoa.... Even if he were to run across Susy and Altringham, what\r\nof it? Better get the job over. People had long since ceased to take on\r\ntragedy airs about divorce: dividing couples dined together to the last,\r\nand met afterward in each other\xe2\x80\x99s houses, happy in the consciousness\r\nthat their respective remarriages had provided two new centres of\r\nentertainment. Yet most of the couples who took their re-matings so\r\nphilosophically had doubtless had their hour of enchantment, of belief\r\nin the immortality of loving; whereas he and Susy had simply and frankly\r\nentered into a business contract for their mutual advantage. The fact\r\ngave the last touch of incongruity to his agonies and exaltations, and\r\nmade him appear to himself as grotesque and superannuated as the hero of\r\na romantic novel.\r\n\r\nHe stood up from a bench on which he had been lounging in the Luxembourg\r\ngardens, and hailed a taxi. Dusk had fallen, and he meant to go back to\r\nhis hotel, take a rest, and then go out to dine. But instead, he threw\r\nSusy\xe2\x80\x99s address to the driver, and settled down in the cab, resting both\r\nhands on the knob of his umbrella and staring straight ahead of him as\r\nif he were accomplishing some tiresome duty that had to be got through\r\nwith before he could turn his mind to more important things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the easiest way,\xe2\x80\x9d he heard himself say.\r\n\r\nAt the street-corner--her street-corner--he stopped the cab, and stood\r\nmotionless while it rattled away. It was a short vague street, much\r\nfarther off than he had expected, and fading away at the farther end in\r\na dusky blur of hoardings overhung by trees. A thin rain was beginning\r\nto fall, and it was already night in this inadequately lit suburban\r\nquarter. Lansing walked down the empty street. The houses stood a few\r\nyards apart, with bare-twigged shrubs between, and gates and railings\r\ndividing them from the pavement. He could not, at first, distinguish\r\ntheir numbers; but presently, coming abreast of a street-lamp, he\r\ndiscovered that the small shabby facade it illuminated was precisely\r\nthe one he sought. The discovery surprised him. He had imagined that, as\r\nfrequently happened in the outlying quarters of Passy and La Muette,\r\nthe mean street would lead to a stately private hotel, built upon some\r\nbowery fragment of an old country-place. It was the latest whim of the\r\nwealthy to establish themselves on these outskirts of Paris, where\r\nthere was still space for verdure; and he had pictured Susy behind\r\nsome pillared house-front, with lights pouring across glossy turf to\r\nsculptured gateposts. Instead, he saw a six-windowed house, huddled\r\namong neighbours of its kind, with the family wash fluttering between\r\nmeagre bushes. The arc-light beat ironically on its front, which had\r\nthe worn look of a tired work-woman\xe2\x80\x99s face; and Lansing, as he leaned\r\nagainst the opposite railing, vainly tried to fit his vision of Susy\r\ninto so humble a setting.\r\n\r\nThe probable explanation was that his lawyer had given him the wrong\r\naddress; not only the wrong number but the wrong street. He pulled out\r\nthe slip of paper, and was crossing over to decipher it under the lamp,\r\nwhen an errand-boy appeared out of the obscurity, and approached the\r\nhouse. Nick drew back, and the boy, unlatching the gate, ran up the\r\nsteps and gave the bell a pull.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately the door opened; and there stood Susy, the light full\r\nupon her, and upon a red-checked child against her shoulder. The space\r\nbehind them was dark, or so dimly lit that it formed a black background\r\nto her vivid figure. She looked at the errand-boy without surprise, took\r\nhis parcel, and after he had turned away, lingered a moment in the door,\r\nglancing down the empty street.\r\n\r\nThat moment, to her watcher, seemed quicker than a flash yet as long\r\nas a life-time. There she was, a stone\xe2\x80\x99s throw away, but utterly\r\nunconscious of his presence: his Susy, the old Susy, and yet a new Susy,\r\ncuriously transformed, transfigured almost, by the new attitude in which\r\nhe beheld her.\r\n\r\nIn the first shock of the vision he forgot his surprise at her being in\r\nsuch a place, forgot to wonder whose house she was in, or whose was\r\nthe sleepy child in her arms. For an instant she stood out from the\r\nblackness behind her, and through the veil of the winter night, a thing\r\napart, an unconditioned vision, the eternal image of the woman and\r\nthe child; and in that instant everything within him was changed and\r\nrenewed. His eyes were still absorbing her, finding again the familiar\r\ncurves of her light body, noting the thinness of the lifted arm that\r\nupheld the little boy, the droop of the shoulder he weighed on, the\r\nbrooding way in which her cheek leaned to his even while she looked\r\naway; then she drew back, the door closed, and the street-lamp again\r\nshone on blankness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she\xe2\x80\x99s mine!\xe2\x80\x9d Nick cried, in a fierce triumph of recovery...\r\n\r\nHis eyes were so full of her that he shut them to hold in the crowding\r\nvision.\r\n\r\nIt remained with him, at first, as a complete picture; then gradually it\r\nbroke up into its component parts, the child vanished, the strange house\r\nvanished, and Susy alone stood before him, his own Susy, only his Susy,\r\nyet changed, worn, tempered--older, even--with sharper shadows under\r\nthe cheek-bones, the brows drawn, the joint of the slim wrist more\r\nprominent. It was not thus that his memory had evoked her, and he\r\nrecalled, with a remorseful pang, the fact that something in her\r\nlook, her dress, her tired and drooping attitude, suggested poverty,\r\ndependence, seemed to make her after all a part of the shabby house in\r\nwhich, at first sight, her presence had seemed so incongruous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she looks poor!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, his heart tightening. And instantly\r\nit occurred to him that these must be the Fulmer children whom she\r\nwas living with while their parents travelled in Italy. Rumours of Nat\r\nFulmer\xe2\x80\x99s sudden ascension had reached him, and he had heard that the\r\ncouple had lately been seen in Naples and Palermo. No one had mentioned\r\nSusy\xe2\x80\x99s name in connection with them, and he could hardly tell why he\r\nhad arrived at this conclusion, except perhaps because it seemed natural\r\nthat, if Susy were in trouble, she should turn to her old friend Grace.\r\n\r\nBut why in trouble? What trouble? What could have happened to check her\r\ntriumphant career?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean to find out!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nHis heart was beating with a tumult of new hopes and old memories. The\r\nsight of his wife, so remote in mien and manner from the world in\r\nwhich he had imagined her to be re-absorbed, changed in a flash his own\r\nrelation to life, and flung a mist of unreality over all that he\r\nhad been trying to think most solid and tangible. Nothing now was\r\nsubstantial to him but the stones of the street in which he stood, the\r\nfront of the house which hid her, the bell-handle he already felt in\r\nhis grasp. He started forward, and was halfway to the threshold when a\r\nprivate motor turned the corner, the twin glitter of its lamps carpeting\r\nthe wet street with gold to Susy\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\nLansing drew back into the shadow as the motor swept up to the house. A\r\nman jumped out, and the light fell on Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s shambling figure, its\r\nlazy disjointed movements so unmistakably the same under his fur coat,\r\nand in the new setting of prosperity.\r\n\r\nLansing stood motionless, staring at the door. Strefford rang, and\r\nwaited. Would Susy appear again? Perhaps she had done so before only\r\nbecause she had been on the watch....\r\n\r\nBut no: after a slight delay a bonne appeared--the breathless\r\nmaid-of-all-work of a busy household--and at once effaced herself,\r\nletting the visitor in. Lansing was sure that not a word passed between\r\nthe two, of enquiry on Lord Altringham\xe2\x80\x99s part, or of acquiescence on the\r\nservant\xe2\x80\x99s. There could be no doubt that he was expected.\r\n\r\nThe door closed on him, and a light appeared behind the blind of the\r\nadjoining window. The maid had shown the visitor into the sitting-room\r\nand lit the lamp. Upstairs, meanwhile, Susy was no doubt running skilful\r\nfingers through her tumbled hair and daubing her pale lips with red.\r\nAh, how Lansing knew every movement of that familiar rite, even to the\r\npucker of the brow and the pouting thrust-out of the lower lip! He was\r\nseized with a sense of physical sickness as the succession of remembered\r\ngestures pressed upon his eyes.... And the other man? The other man,\r\ninside the house, was perhaps at that very instant smiling over the\r\nremembrance of the same scene!\r\n\r\nAt the thought, Lansing plunged away into the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUSY and Lord Altringham sat in the little drawing-room, divided from\r\neach other by a table carrying a smoky lamp and heaped with tattered\r\nschool-books.\r\n\r\nIn another half hour the bonne, despatched to fetch the children from\r\ntheir classes, would be back with her flock; and at any moment Geordie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimperious cries might summon his slave up to the nursery. In the scant\r\ntime allotted them, the two sat, and visibly wondered what to say.\r\n\r\nStrefford, on entering, had glanced about the dreary room, with its\r\npiano laden with tattered music, the children\xe2\x80\x99s toys littering the lame\r\nsofa, the bunches of dyed grass and impaled butterflies flanking the\r\ncast-bronze clock. Then he had turned to Susy and asked simply: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy on\r\nearth are you here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had not tried to explain; from the first, she had understood the\r\nimpossibility of doing so. And she would not betray her secret longing\r\nto return to Nick, now that she knew that Nick had taken definite steps\r\nfor his release. In dread lest Strefford should have heard of this, and\r\nshould announce it to her, coupling it with the news of Nick\xe2\x80\x99s projected\r\nmarriage, and lest, hearing her fears thus substantiated, she should\r\nlose her self-control, she had preferred to say, in a voice that she\r\ntried to make indifferent: \xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98proceedings,\xe2\x80\x99 or whatever the lawyers\r\ncall them, have begun. While they\xe2\x80\x99re going on I like to stay quite by\r\nmyself.... I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrefford, at that, had looked at her keenly. \xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured; and\r\nhis lips were twisted into their old mocking smile. \xe2\x80\x9cSpeaking of\r\nproceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on carelessly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat stage have Ellie\xe2\x80\x99s reached,\r\nI wonder? I saw her and Vanderlyn and Bockheimer all lunching cheerfully\r\ntogether to-day at Larue\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe blood rushed to Susy\xe2\x80\x99s forehead. She remembered her tragic evening\r\nwith Nelson Vanderlyn, only two months earlier, and thought to herself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn time, then, I suppose, Nick and I....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAloud she said: \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine how Nelson and Ellie can ever want to\r\nsee each other again. And in a restaurant, of all places!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrefford continued to smile. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, you\xe2\x80\x99re incorrigibly\r\nold-fashioned. Why should two people who\xe2\x80\x99ve done each other the best\r\nturn they could by getting out of each other\xe2\x80\x99s way at the right moment\r\nbehave like sworn enemies ever afterward? It\xe2\x80\x99s too absurd; the humbug\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntoo flagrant. Whatever our generation has failed to do, it\xe2\x80\x99s got rid of\r\nhumbug; and that\xe2\x80\x99s enough to immortalize it. I daresay Nelson and Ellie\r\nnever liked each other better than they do to-day. Twenty years ago,\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d have been afraid to confess it; but why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy looked at Strefford, conscious that under his words was the ache of\r\nthe disappointment she had caused him; and yet conscious also that that\r\nvery ache was not the overwhelming penetrating emotion he perhaps wished\r\nit to be, but a pang on a par with a dozen others; and that even while\r\nhe felt it he foresaw the day when he should cease to feel it. And she\r\nthought to herself that this certainty of oblivion must be bitterer than\r\nany certainty of pain.\r\n\r\nA silence had fallen between them. He broke it by rising from his\r\nseat, and saying with a shrug: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll end by driving me to marry Joan\r\nSenechal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, why not? She\xe2\x80\x99s lovely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but she\xe2\x80\x99ll bore me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Streff! So should I--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps. But nothing like as soon--\xe2\x80\x9d He grinned sardonically. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbe more margin.\xe2\x80\x9d He appeared to wait for her to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what else on\r\nearth are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, as she still remained silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Streff, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t marry you for a reason like that!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured\r\nat length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen marry me, and find your reason afterward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer lips made a movement of denial, and still in silence she held out\r\nher hand for good-bye. He clasped it, and then turned away; but on the\r\nthreshold he paused, his screwed-up eyes fixed on her wistfully.\r\n\r\nThe look moved her, and she added hurriedly: \xe2\x80\x9cThe only reason I can find\r\nis one for not marrying you. It\xe2\x80\x99s because I can\xe2\x80\x99t yet feel unmarried\r\nenough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnmarried enough? But I thought Nick was doing his best to make you\r\nfeel that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. But even when he has--sometimes I think even that won\xe2\x80\x99t make any\r\ndifference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe still scrutinized her hesitatingly, with the gravest eyes she had\r\never seen in his careless face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, that\xe2\x80\x99s rather the way I feel about you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said simply as he\r\nturned to go.\r\n\r\nThat evening after the children had gone to bed Susy sat up late in the\r\ncheerless sitting-room. She was not thinking of Strefford but of Nick.\r\nHe was coming to Paris--perhaps he had already arrived. The idea that he\r\nmight be in the same place with her at that very moment, and without her\r\nknowing it, was so strange and painful that she felt a violent revolt of\r\nall her strong and joy-loving youth. Why should she go on suffering so\r\nunbearably, so abjectly, so miserably? If only she could see him, hear\r\nhis voice, even hear him say again such cruel and humiliating words as\r\nhe had spoken on that dreadful day in Venice when that would be better\r\nthan this blankness, this utter and final exclusion from his life! He\r\nhad been cruel to her, unimaginably cruel: hard, arrogant, unjust; and\r\nhad been so, perhaps, deliberately, because he already wanted to be\r\nfree. But she was ready to face even that possibility, to humble herself\r\nstill farther than he had humbled her--she was ready to do anything, if\r\nonly she might see him once again.\r\n\r\nShe leaned her aching head on her hands and pondered. Do anything? But\r\nwhat could she do? Nothing that should hurt him, interfere with his\r\nliberty, be false to the spirit of their pact: on that she was more than\r\never resolved. She had made a bargain, and she meant to stick to it, not\r\nfor any abstract reason, but simply because she happened to love him in\r\nthat way. Yes--but to see him again, only once!\r\n\r\nSuddenly she remembered what Strefford had said about Nelson Vanderlyn\r\nand his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should two people who\xe2\x80\x99ve just done each other the\r\nbest turn they could behave like sworn enemies ever after?\xe2\x80\x9d If in\r\noffering Nick his freedom she had indeed done him such a service as\r\nthat, perhaps he no longer hated her, would no longer be unwilling\r\nto see her.... At any rate, why should she not write to him on that\r\nassumption, write in a spirit of simple friendliness, suggesting that\r\nthey should meet and \xe2\x80\x9csettle things\xe2\x80\x9d? The business-like word \xe2\x80\x9csettle\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n (how she hated it) would prove to him that she had no secret designs\r\nupon his liberty; and besides he was too unprejudiced, too modern, too\r\nfree from what Strefford called humbug, not to understand and accept\r\nsuch a suggestion. After all, perhaps Strefford was right; it was\r\nsomething to have rid human relations of hypocrisy, even if, in the\r\nprocess, so many exquisite things seemed somehow to have been torn away\r\nwith it....\r\n\r\nShe ran up to her room, scribbled a note, and hurried with it through\r\nthe rain and darkness to the post-box at the corner. As she returned\r\nthrough the empty street she had an odd feeling that it was not\r\nempty--that perhaps Nick was already there, somewhere near her in the\r\nnight, about to follow her to the door, enter the house, go up with\r\nher to her bedroom in the old way. It was strange how close he had been\r\nbrought by the mere fact of her having written that little note to him!\r\n\r\nIn the bedroom, Geordie lay in his crib in ruddy slumber, and she blew\r\nout the candle and undressed softly for fear of waking him.\r\n\r\nNick Lansing, the next day, received Susy\xe2\x80\x99s letter, transmitted to his\r\nhotel from the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s office.\r\n\r\nHe read it carefully, two or three times over, weighing and scrutinizing\r\nthe guarded words. She proposed that they should meet to \xe2\x80\x9csettle\r\nthings.\xe2\x80\x9d What things? And why should he accede to such a request? What\r\nsecret purpose had prompted her? It was horrible that nowadays, in\r\nthinking of Susy, he should always suspect ulterior motives, be meanly\r\non the watch for some hidden tortuousness. What on earth was she trying\r\nto \xe2\x80\x9cmanage\xe2\x80\x9d now, he wondered.\r\n\r\nA few hours ago, at the sight of her, all his hardness had melted, and\r\nhe had charged himself with cruelty, with injustice, with every sin of\r\npride against himself and her; but the appearance of Strefford, arriving\r\nat that late hour, and so evidently expected and welcomed, had driven\r\nback the rising tide of tenderness.\r\n\r\nYet, after all, what was there to wonder at? Nothing was changed in\r\ntheir respective situations. He had left his wife, deliberately, and for\r\nreasons which no subsequent experience had caused him to modify. She had\r\napparently acquiesced in his decision, and had utilized it, as she was\r\njustified in doing, to assure her own future.\r\n\r\nIn all this, what was there to wail or knock the breast between two\r\npeople who prided themselves on looking facts in the face, and making\r\ntheir grim best of them, without vain repinings? He had been right in\r\nthinking their marriage an act of madness. Her charms had overruled his\r\njudgment, and they had had their year... their mad year... or at least\r\nall but two or three months of it. But his first intuition had been\r\nright; and now they must both pay for their madness. The Fates seldom\r\nforget the bargains made with them, or fail to ask for compound\r\ninterest. Why not, then, now that the time had come, pay up gallantly,\r\nand remember of the episode only what had made it seem so supremely\r\nworth the cost?\r\n\r\nHe sent a pneumatic telegram to Mrs. Nicholas Lansing to say that he\r\nwould call on her that afternoon at four. \xe2\x80\x9cThat ought to give us time,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he reflected drily, \xe2\x80\x9cto \xe2\x80\x98settle things,\xe2\x80\x99 as she calls it, without\r\ninterfering with Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s afternoon visit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHER husband\xe2\x80\x99s note had briefly said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-day at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock. N.L.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll day she pored over the words in an agony of longing, trying to read\r\ninto them regret, emotion, memories, some echo of the tumult in her own\r\nbosom. But she had signed \xe2\x80\x9cSusy,\xe2\x80\x9d and he signed \xe2\x80\x9cN.L.\xe2\x80\x9d That seemed\r\nto put an abyss between them. After all, she was free and he was not.\r\nPerhaps, in view of his situation, she had only increased the distance\r\nbetween them by her unconventional request for a meeting.\r\n\r\nShe sat in the little drawing-room, and the cast-bronze clock ticked out\r\nthe minutes. She would not look out of the window: it might bring bad\r\nluck to watch for him. And it seemed to her that a thousand invisible\r\nspirits, hidden demons of good and evil, pressed about her, spying out\r\nher thoughts, counting her heart-beats, ready to pounce upon the least\r\nsymptom of over-confidence and turn it deftly to derision. Oh, for an\r\naltar on which to pour out propitiatory offerings! But what sweeter\r\ncould they have than her smothered heart-beats, her choked-back tears?\r\n\r\nThe bell rang, and she stood up as if a spring had jerked her to her\r\nfeet. In the mirror between the dried grasses her face looked long pale\r\ninanimate. Ah, if he should find her too changed--! If there were but\r\ntime to dash upstairs and put on a touch of red....\r\n\r\nThe door opened; it shut on him; he was there.\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou wanted to see me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered: \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d And her heart seemed to stop beating.\r\n\r\nAt first she could not make out what mysterious change had come over\r\nhim, and why it was that in looking at him she seemed to be looking at a\r\nstranger; then she perceived that his voice sounded as it used to sound\r\nwhen he was talking to other people; and she said to herself, with a\r\nsick shiver of understanding, that she had become an \xe2\x80\x9cother person\xe2\x80\x9d to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThere was a deathly pause; then she faltered out, not knowing what she\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cNick--you\xe2\x80\x99ll sit down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x9cThanks,\xe2\x80\x9d but did not seem to have heard her, for he continued\r\nto stand motionless, half the room between them. And slowly the\r\nuselessness, the hopelessness of his being there overcame her. A wall of\r\ngranite seemed to have built itself up between them. She felt as if\r\nit hid her from him, as if with those remote new eyes of his he were\r\nstaring into the wall and not at her. Suddenly she said to herself:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s suffering more than I am, because he pities me, and is afraid to\r\ntell me that he is going to be married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe thought stung her pride, and she lifted her head and met his eyes\r\nwith a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s more sensible--with everything so\r\nchanged in our lives--that we should meet as friends, in this way? I\r\nwanted to tell you that you needn\xe2\x80\x99t feel--feel in the least unhappy\r\nabout me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA deep flush rose to his forehead. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know--I know that--\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ndeclared hastily; and added, with a factitious animation: \xe2\x80\x9cBut thank you\r\nfor telling me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing, is there,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cto make our meeting in this\r\nway in the least embarrassing or painful to either of us, when both\r\nhave found....\xe2\x80\x9d She broke off, and held her hand out to him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard\r\nabout you and Coral,\xe2\x80\x9d she ended.\r\n\r\nHe just touched her hand with cold fingers, and let it drop. \xe2\x80\x9cThank\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d he said for the third time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t sit down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the new way of... of meeting\r\nas friends... and talking things over without ill-will... is much\r\npleasanter and more sensible, after all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s immensely kind of you to feel that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I do feel it!\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped short, and wondered what on earth she\r\nhad meant to say next, and why she had so abruptly lost the thread of\r\nher discourse.\r\n\r\nIn the pause she heard him cough slightly and clear his throat. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me\r\nsay, then,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99m glad too--immensely glad that your own\r\nfuture is so satisfactorily settled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe lifted her glance again to his walled face, in which not a muscle\r\nstirred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes: it--it makes everything easier for you, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor you too, I hope.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused, and then went on: \xe2\x80\x9cI want also to tell\r\nyou that I perfectly understand--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted, \xe2\x80\x9cso do I; your point of view, I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were again silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNick, why can\xe2\x80\x99t we be friends real friends? Won\xe2\x80\x99t it be easier?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nbroke out at last with twitching lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEasier--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, about talking things over--arrangements. There are arrangements\r\nto be made, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so.\xe2\x80\x9d He hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m doing what I\xe2\x80\x99m told--simply following\r\nout instructions. The business is easy enough, apparently. I\xe2\x80\x99m taking\r\nthe necessary steps--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe reddened a little, and drew a gasping breath. \xe2\x80\x9cThe necessary steps:\r\nwhat are they? Everything the lawyers tell one is so confusing.... I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t yet understand--how it\xe2\x80\x99s done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy share, you mean? Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s very simple.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused, and added in a\r\ntone of laboured ease: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going down to Fontainebleau to-morrow--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stared, not understanding. \xe2\x80\x9cTo Fontainebleau--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer bewilderment drew from him his first frank smile. \xe2\x80\x9cWell--I chose\r\nFontainebleau--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why... except that we\xe2\x80\x99ve never been there\r\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that she suddenly understood, and the blood rushed to her forehead.\r\nShe stood up without knowing what she was doing, her heart in her\r\nthroat. \xe2\x80\x9cHow grotesque--how utterly disgusting!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave a slight shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t make the laws....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t it too stupid and degrading that such things should be\r\nnecessary when two people want to part--?\xe2\x80\x9d She broke off again, silenced\r\nby the echo of that fatal \xe2\x80\x9cwant to part.\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\nHe seemed to prefer not to dwell farther on the legal obligations\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet told me,\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested, \xe2\x80\x9chow you happen to be living\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere--with the Fulmer children?\xe2\x80\x9d She roused herself, trying to catch\r\nhis easier note. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve simply been governessing them for a few\r\nweeks, while Nat and Grace are in Sicily.\xe2\x80\x9d She did not say: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbecause I\xe2\x80\x99ve parted with Strefford.\xe2\x80\x9d Somehow it helped her wounded pride\r\na little to keep from him the secret of her precarious independence.\r\n\r\nHe looked his wonder. \xe2\x80\x9cAll alone with that bewildered bonne? But how\r\nmany of them are there? Five? Good Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d He contemplated the clock with\r\nunseeing eyes, and then turned them again on her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have thought a lot of children would rather get on your\r\nnerves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, not these children. They\xe2\x80\x99re so good to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, I suppose it won\xe2\x80\x99t be for long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sent his eyes again about the room, which his absent-minded gaze\r\nseemed to reduce to its dismal constituent elements, and added, with an\r\nobvious effort at small talk: \xe2\x80\x9cI hear the Fulmers are not hitting it off\r\nvery well since his success. Is it true that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to marry Violet\r\nMelrose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe blood rose to Susy\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, never, never! He and Grace are\r\ntravelling together now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know. People say things....\xe2\x80\x9d He was visibly embarrassed\r\nwith the subject, and sorry that he had broached it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of the things that people say are true. But Grace doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\r\nShe says she and Nat belong to each other. They can\xe2\x80\x99t help it, she\r\nthinks, after having been through such a lot together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear old Grace!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had risen from his chair, and this time she made no effort to detain\r\nhim. He seemed to have recovered his self-composure, and it struck her\r\npainfully, humiliatingly almost, that he should have spoken in that\r\nlight way of the expedition to Fontainebleau on the morrow.... Well,\r\nmen were different, she supposed; she remembered having felt that once\r\nbefore about Nick.\r\n\r\nIt was on the tip of her tongue to cry out: \xe2\x80\x9cBut wait--wait! I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\ngoing to marry Strefford after all!\xe2\x80\x9d--but to do so would seem like an\r\nappeal to his compassion, to his indulgence; and that was not what she\r\nwanted. She could never forget that he had left her because he had not\r\nbeen able to forgive her for \xe2\x80\x9cmanaging\xe2\x80\x9d--and not for the world would she\r\nhave him think that this meeting had been planned for such a purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see that I am different, in spite of appearances... and\r\nthat I never was what he said I was that day--if in all these months it\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t come over him, what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of trying to make him see it now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she mused. And then, her thoughts hurrying on: \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he\xe2\x80\x99s suffering\r\ntoo--I believe he is suffering--at any rate, he\xe2\x80\x99s suffering for me, if\r\nnot for himself. But if he\xe2\x80\x99s pledged to Coral, what can he do? What\r\nwould he think of me if I tried to make him break his word to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere he stood--the man who was \xe2\x80\x9cgoing to Fontainebleau to-morrow\xe2\x80\x9d; who\r\ncalled it \xe2\x80\x9ctaking the necessary steps!\xe2\x80\x9d Who could smile as he made the\r\ncareless statement! A world seemed to divide them already: it was as if\r\ntheir parting were already over. All the words, cries, arguments beating\r\nloud wings in her dropped back into silence. The only thought left was:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much longer does he mean to go on standing there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe may have read the question in her face, for turning back from an\r\nabsorbed contemplation of the window curtains he said: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\nelse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean: you spoke of things to be settled--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe flushed, suddenly remembering the pretext she had used to summon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she faltered, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know... I thought there might be.... But\r\nthe lawyers, I suppose....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe saw the relief on his contracted face. \xe2\x80\x9cExactly. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always thought\r\nit was best to leave it to them. I assure you\xe2\x80\x9d--again for a moment the\r\nsmile strained his lips--\xe2\x80\x9cI shall do nothing to interfere with a quick\r\nsettlement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stood motionless, feeling herself turn to stone. He appeared already\r\na long way off, like a figure vanishing down a remote perspective.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen--good-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d she heard him say from its farther end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,--good-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d she faltered, as if she had not had the word ready, and\r\nwas relieved to have him supply it.\r\n\r\nHe stopped again on the threshold, looked back at her, began to speak.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve--\xe2\x80\x9d he said; then he repeated \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d as though to make sure he\r\nhad not forgotten to say it; and the door closed on him.\r\n\r\nIt was over; she had had her last chance and missed it. Now, whatever\r\nhappened, the one thing she had lived and longed for would never be. He\r\nhad come, and she had let him go again....\r\n\r\nHow had it come about? Would she ever be able to explain it to herself?\r\nHow was it that she, so fertile in strategy, so practiced in feminine\r\narts, had stood there before him, helpless, inarticulate, like a\r\nschool-girl a-choke with her first love-longing? If he was gone, and\r\ngone never to return, it was her own fault, and none but hers. What had\r\nshe done to move him, detain him, make his heart beat and his head\r\nswim as hers were beating and swimming? She stood aghast at her own\r\ninadequacy, her stony inexpressiveness....\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly she lifted her hands to her throbbing forehead and cried\r\nout: \xe2\x80\x9cBut this is love! This must be love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had loved him before, she supposed; for what else was she to call\r\nthe impulse that had drawn her to him, taught her how to overcome his\r\nscruples, and whirled him away with her on their mad adventure? Well,\r\nif that was love, this was something so much larger and deeper that the\r\nother feeling seemed the mere dancing of her blood in tune with his....\r\n\r\nBut, no! Real love, great love, the love that poets sang, and privileged\r\nand tortured beings lived and died of, that love had its own superior\r\nexpressiveness, and the sure command of its means. The petty arts of\r\ncoquetry were no farther from it than the numbness of the untaught\r\ngirl. Great love was wise, strong, powerful, like genius, like any other\r\ndominant form of human power. It knew itself, and what it wanted, and\r\nhow to attain its ends.\r\n\r\nNot great love, then... but just the common humble average of human love\r\nwas hers. And it had come to her so newly, so overwhelmingly, with a\r\nface so grave, a touch so startling, that she had stood there petrified,\r\nhumbled at the first look of its eyes, recognizing that what she had\r\nonce taken for love was merely pleasure and spring-time, and the flavour\r\nof youth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how was I to know? And now it\xe2\x80\x99s too late!\xe2\x80\x9d she wailed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE inhabitants of the little house in Passy were of necessity early\r\nrisers; but when Susy jumped out of bed the next morning no one else\r\nwas astir, and it lacked nearly an hour of the call of the bonne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nalarm-clock.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Susy leaned out of her dark room into the darker night.\r\nA cold drizzle fell on her face, and she shivered and drew back. Then,\r\nlighting a candle, and shading it, as her habit was, from the sleeping\r\nchild, she slipped on her dressing-gown and opened the door. On the\r\nthreshold she paused to look at her watch. Only half-past five! She\r\nthought with compunction of the unkindness of breaking in on Junie\r\nFulmer\xe2\x80\x99s slumbers; but such scruples did not weigh an ounce in the\r\nbalance of her purpose. Poor Junie would have to oversleep herself on\r\nSunday, that was all.\r\n\r\nSusy stole into the passage, opened a door, and cast her light on the\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJunie! Dearest Junie, you must wake up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJunie lay in the abandonment of youthful sleep; but at the sound of her\r\nname she sat up with the promptness of a grown person on whom domestic\r\nburdens have long weighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich one of them is it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, one foot already out of bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Junie dear, no... it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong with the children... or with\r\nanybody,\xe2\x80\x9d Susy stammered, on her knees by the bed.\r\n\r\nIn the candlelight, she saw Junie\xe2\x80\x99s anxious brow darken reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Susy, then why--? I was just dreaming we were all driving about\r\nRome in a great big motor-car with father and mother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry, dear. What a lovely dream! I\xe2\x80\x99m a brute to have\r\ninterrupted it--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe felt the little girl\xe2\x80\x99s awakening scrutiny. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong\r\nwith anybody, why are you crying, Susy? Is it you there\xe2\x80\x99s something\r\nwrong with? What has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I crying?\xe2\x80\x9d Susy rose from her knees and sat down on the counterpane.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is me. And I had to disturb you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Susy, darling, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d Junie\xe2\x80\x99s arms were about her in a flash,\r\nand Susy grasped them in burning fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJunie, listen! I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go away at once--to leave you all for the\r\nwhole day. I may not be back till late this evening; late to-night; I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t tell. I promised your mother I\xe2\x80\x99d never leave you; but I\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nto--I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJunie considered her agitated face with fully awakened eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t tell, you know, you old brick,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with simplicity.\r\n\r\nSusy hugged her. \xe2\x80\x9cJunie, Junie, you darling! But that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t what I\r\nmeant. Of course you may tell--you must tell. I shall write to\r\nyour mother myself. But what worries me is the idea of having to go\r\naway--away from Paris--for the whole day, with Geordie still coughing a\r\nlittle, and no one but that silly Angele to stay with him while you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nout--and no one but you to take yourself and the others to school. But\r\nJunie, Junie, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do it!\xe2\x80\x9d she sobbed out, clutching the child\r\ntighter.\r\n\r\nJunie Fulmer, with her strangely mature perception of the case, and\r\nseemingly of every case that fate might call on her to deal with, sat\r\nfor a moment motionless in Susy\xe2\x80\x99s hold. Then she freed her wrists with\r\nan adroit twist, and leaning back against the pillows said judiciously:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll never in the world bring up a family of your own if you take on\r\nlike this over other people\xe2\x80\x99s children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThrough all her turmoil of spirit the observation drew a laugh from\r\nSusy. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, a family of my own--I don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve one, the way I\xe2\x80\x99m behaving\r\nto your--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJunie still considered her. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, a change will do you good: you\r\nneed it,\xe2\x80\x9d she pronounced.\r\n\r\nSusy rose with a laughing sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not at all sure it will! But I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot to have it, all the same. Only I do feel anxious--and I can\xe2\x80\x99t even\r\nleave you my address!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJunie still seemed to examine the case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you even tell me where you\xe2\x80\x99re going?\xe2\x80\x9d she ventured, as if not\r\nquite sure of the delicacy of asking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can; not till I get back. Besides, even if\r\nI could it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be much use, because I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give you my address\r\nthere. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it will be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what does it matter, if you\xe2\x80\x99re coming back to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I\xe2\x80\x99m coming back! How could you possibly imagine I should\r\nthink of leaving you for more than a day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid--not much, that is, with the poker, and Nat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwater-pistol,\xe2\x80\x9d emended Junie, still judicious.\r\n\r\nSusy again enfolded her vehemently, and then turned to more practical\r\nmatters. She explained that she wished if possible to catch an\r\neight-thirty train from the Gare de Lyon, and that there was not a\r\nmoment to lose if the children were to be dressed and fed, and full\r\ninstructions written out for Junie and Angele, before she rushed for the\r\nunderground.\r\n\r\nWhile she bathed Geordie, and then hurried into her own clothes, she\r\ncould not help wondering at her own extreme solicitude for her charges.\r\nShe remembered, with a pang, how often she had deserted Clarissa\r\nVanderlyn for the whole day, and even for two or three in\r\nsuccession--poor little Clarissa, whom she knew to be so unprotected,\r\nso exposed to evil influences. She had been too much absorbed in her own\r\ngreedy bliss to be more than intermittently aware of the child; but now,\r\nshe felt, no sorrow however ravaging, no happiness however absorbing,\r\nwould ever again isolate her from her kind.\r\n\r\nAnd then these children were so different! The exquisite Clarissa was\r\nalready the predestined victim of her surroundings: her budding soul\r\nwas divided from Susy\xe2\x80\x99s by the same barrier of incomprehension that\r\nseparated the latter from Mrs. Vanderlyn. Clarissa had nothing to\r\nteach Susy but the horror of her own hard little appetites; whereas the\r\ncompany of the noisy argumentative Fulmers had been a school of wisdom\r\nand abnegation.\r\n\r\nAs she applied the brush to Geordie\xe2\x80\x99s shining head and the handkerchief\r\nto his snuffling nose, the sense of what she owed him was so borne in on\r\nSusy that she interrupted the process to catch him to her bosom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have such a story to tell you when I get back to-night, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\npromise me to be good all day,\xe2\x80\x9d she bargained with him; and Geordie,\r\nalways astute, bargained back: \xe2\x80\x9cBefore I promise, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know what\r\nstory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt length all was in order. Junie had been enlightened, and Angele\r\nstunned, by the minuteness of Susy\xe2\x80\x99s instructions; and the latter,\r\nwaterproofed and stoutly shod, descended the doorstep, and paused to\r\nwave at the pyramid of heads yearning to her from an upper window.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly light, and still raining, when she turned into the dismal\r\nstreet. As usual, it was empty; but at the corner she perceived a\r\nhesitating taxi, with luggage piled beside the driver. Perhaps it was\r\nsome early traveller, just arriving, who would release the carriage in\r\ntime for her to catch it, and thus avoid the walk to the metro, and the\r\nsubsequent strap-hanging; for it was the work-people\xe2\x80\x99s hour. Susy raced\r\ntoward the vehicle, which, overcoming its hesitation, was beginning to\r\nmove in her direction. Observing this, she stopped to see where it\r\nwould discharge its load. Thereupon the taxi stopped also, and the load\r\ndischarged itself in front of her in the shape of Nick Lansing.\r\n\r\nThe two stood staring at each other through the rain till Nick broke\r\nout: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going? I came to get you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo get me? To get me?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. Beside the driver she had suddenly\r\nremarked the old suit-case from which her husband had obliged her to\r\nextract Strefford\xe2\x80\x99s cigars as they were leaving Como; and everything\r\nthat had happened since seemed to fall away and vanish in the pang and\r\nrapture of that memory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo get you; yes. Of course.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke the words peremptorily, almost as\r\nif they were an order. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere were you going?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\r\n\r\nWithout answering, she turned toward the house. He followed her, and the\r\nladen taxi closed the procession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you out in such weather without an umbrella?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, in\r\nthe same severe tone, drawing her under the shelter of his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, because Junie\xe2\x80\x99s umbrella is in tatters, and I had to leave her\r\nmine, as I was going away for the whole day.\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke the words like a\r\nperson in a trance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the whole day? At this hour? Where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were on the doorstep, and she fumbled automatically for her key,\r\nlet herself in, and led the way to the sitting-room. It had not been\r\ntidied up since the night before. The children\xe2\x80\x99s school books lay\r\nscattered on the table and sofa, and the empty fireplace was grey with\r\nashes. She turned to Nick in the pallid light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was going to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d she stammered, \xe2\x80\x9cI was going to follow you to\r\nFontainebleau, if necessary, to tell you... to prevent you....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe repeated in the same aggressive tone: \xe2\x80\x9cTell me what? Prevent what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell you that there must be some other way... some decent way... of our\r\nseparating... without that horror, that horror of your going off with a\r\nwoman....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stared, and then burst into a laugh. The blood rushed to her face.\r\nShe had caught a familiar ring in his laugh, and it wounded her. What\r\nbusiness had he, at such a time, to laugh in the old way?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry; but there is no other way, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid. No other way but\r\none,\xe2\x80\x9d he corrected himself.\r\n\r\nShe raised her head sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you should be the woman.--Oh, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d He had dropped his mocking\r\nsmile, and was at her side, her hands in his. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear, don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nsee that we\xe2\x80\x99ve both been feeling the same thing, and at the same hour?\r\nYou lay awake thinking of it all night, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you? So did I. Whenever\r\nthe clock struck, I said to myself: \xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s hearing it too.\xe2\x80\x99 And I was up\r\nbefore daylight, and packed my traps--for I never want to set foot again\r\nin that awful hotel where I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived in hell for the last three days.\r\nAnd I swore to myself that I\xe2\x80\x99d go off with a woman by the first train I\r\ncould catch--and so I mean to, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stood before him numb. Yes, numb: that was the worst of it! The\r\nviolence of the reaction had been too great, and she could hardly\r\nunderstand what he was saying. Instead, she noticed that the tassel of\r\nthe window-blind was torn off again (oh, those children!), and vaguely\r\nwondered if his luggage were safe on the waiting taxi. One heard such\r\nstories....\r\n\r\nHis voice came back to her. \xe2\x80\x9cSusy! Listen!\xe2\x80\x9d he was entreating. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmust see yourself that it can\xe2\x80\x99t be. We\xe2\x80\x99re married--isn\xe2\x80\x99t that all that\r\nmatters? Oh, I know--I\xe2\x80\x99ve behaved like a brute: a cursed arrogant ass!\r\nYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wish that ass a worse kicking than I\xe2\x80\x99ve given him! But\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s not the point, you see. The point is that we\xe2\x80\x99re married....\r\nMarried.... Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it mean something to you, something--inexorable? It\r\ndoes to me. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t dream it would--in just that way. But all I can say\r\nis that I suppose the people who don\xe2\x80\x99t feel it aren\xe2\x80\x99t really married--and\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d better separate; much better. As for us--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThrough her tears she gasped out: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I felt... that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\r\nsaid to Streff....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was upon her with a great embrace. \xe2\x80\x9cMy darling! My darling! You have\r\ntold him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she panted. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m living here.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ntold Coral?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe felt his embrace relax. He drew away a little, still holding her,\r\nbut with lowered head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo... I... haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Nick! But then--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe caught her to him again, resentfully. \xe2\x80\x9cWell--then what? What do you\r\nmean? What earthly difference does it make?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you\xe2\x80\x99ve told her you were going to marry her--\xe2\x80\x9d (Try as she\r\nwould, her voice was full of silver chimes.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry her? Marry her?\xe2\x80\x9d he echoed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut how could I? What does marriage\r\nmean anyhow? If it means anything at all it means--you! And I can\xe2\x80\x99t ask\r\nCoral Hicks just to come and live with me, can I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetween crying and laughing she lay on his breast, and his hand passed\r\nover her hair.\r\n\r\nThey were silent for a while; then he began again: \xe2\x80\x9cYou said it yourself\r\nyesterday, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe strayed back from sunlit distances. \xe2\x80\x9cYesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes: that Grace Fulmer says you can\xe2\x80\x99t separate two people who\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nthrough a lot of things--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, been through them together--it\xe2\x80\x99s not the things, you see, it\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ntogetherness,\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe togetherness--that\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x9d He seized on the word as if it had just\r\nbeen coined to express their case, and his mind could rest in it without\r\nfarther labour.\r\n\r\nThe door-bell rang, and they started. Through the window they saw the\r\ntaxi-driver gesticulating enquiries as to the fate of the luggage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wants to know if he\xe2\x80\x99s to leave it here,\xe2\x80\x9d Susy laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--no! You\xe2\x80\x99re to come with me,\xe2\x80\x9d her husband declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome with you?\xe2\x80\x9d She laughed again at the absurdity of the suggestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course: this very instant. What did you suppose? That I was going\r\naway without you? Run up and pack your things,\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy things? My things? But I can\xe2\x80\x99t leave the children!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stared, between indignation and amusement. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t leave the children?\r\nNonsense! Why, you said yourself you were going to follow me to\r\nFontainebleau--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe reddened again, this time a little painfully \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nI was doing.... I had to find you... but I should have come back this\r\nevening, no matter what happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded, and met his gaze resolutely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but really--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, I can\xe2\x80\x99t leave the children till Nat and Grace come back. I\r\npromised I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know then.... Why on earth can\xe2\x80\x99t their nurse look\r\nafter them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t any nurse but me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s only for two weeks more,\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo weeks! Do you know\r\nhow long I\xe2\x80\x99ve been without you!\xe2\x80\x9d He seized her by both wrists, and drew\r\nthem against his breast. \xe2\x80\x9cCome with me at least for two days--Susy!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nentreated her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the very first time you\xe2\x80\x99ve said my name!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSusy, Susy, then--my Susy--Susy! And you\xe2\x80\x99ve only said mine once, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNick!\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed, at peace, as if the one syllable were a magic seed\r\nthat hung out great branches to envelop them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, Susy, be reasonable. Come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReasonable--oh, reasonable!\xe2\x80\x9d she sobbed through laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnreasonable, then! That\xe2\x80\x99s even better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe freed herself, and drew back gently. \xe2\x80\x9cNick, I swore I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave\r\nthem; and I can\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s not only my promise to their mother--it\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve been to me themselves. You don\xe2\x80\x99t, know... You can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine\r\nthe things they\xe2\x80\x99ve taught me. They\xe2\x80\x99re awfully naughty at times, because\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re so clever; but when they\xe2\x80\x99re good they\xe2\x80\x99re the wisest people I\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused, and a sudden inspiration illuminated her. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we take them with us?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nHer husband\xe2\x80\x99s arms fell away from her, and he stood dumfounded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake them with us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll five of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course--I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly separate them. And Junie and Nat will\r\nhelp us to look after the young ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp us!\xe2\x80\x9d he groaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see; they won\xe2\x80\x99t bother you. Just leave it to me; I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmanage--\xe2\x80\x9d The word stopped her short, and an agony of crimson suffused\r\nher from brow to throat. Their eyes met; and without a word he stooped\r\nand laid his lips gently on the stain of red on her neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNick,\xe2\x80\x9d she breathed, her hands in his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut those children--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of answering, she questioned: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis face lit up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnywhere, dearest, that you choose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--I choose Fontainebleau!\xe2\x80\x9d she exulted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I! But we can\xe2\x80\x99t take all those children to an hotel at\r\nFontainebleau, can we?\xe2\x80\x9d he questioned weakly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, dear, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe mere expense of it--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes were already travelling far ahead of him. \xe2\x80\x9cThe expense won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\namount to much. I\xe2\x80\x99ve just remembered that Angele, the bonne, has a\r\nsister who is cook there in a nice old-fashioned pension which must be\r\nalmost empty at this time of year. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I can ma--arrange easily,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she hurried on, nearly tripping again over the fatal word. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd just\r\nthink of the treat it will be to them! This is Friday, and I can get\r\nthem let off from their afternoon classes, and keep them in the country\r\ntill Monday. Poor darlings, they haven\xe2\x80\x99t been out of Paris for months!\r\nAnd I daresay the change will cure Geordie\xe2\x80\x99s cough--Geordie\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nyoungest,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained, surprised to find herself, even in the rapture\r\nof reunion, so absorbed in the welfare of the Fulmers.\r\n\r\nShe was conscious that her husband was surprised also; but instead of\r\nprolonging the argument he simply questioned: \xe2\x80\x9cWas Geordie the chap you\r\nhad in your arms when you opened the front door the night before last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe echoed: \xe2\x80\x9cI opened the front door the night before last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo a boy with a parcel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she sobbed, \xe2\x80\x9cyou were there? You were watching?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe held her to him, and the currents flowed between them warm and full\r\nas on the night of their moon over Como.\r\n\r\nIn a trice, after that, she had the matter in hand and her forces\r\nmarshalled. The taxi was paid, Nick\xe2\x80\x99s luggage deposited in the\r\nvestibule, and the children, just piling down to breakfast, were\r\nsummoned in to hear the news.\r\n\r\nIt was apparent that, seasoned to surprises as they were, Nick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence took them aback. But when, between laughter and embraces, his\r\nidentity, and his right to be where he was, had been made clear to them,\r\nJunie dismissed the matter by asking him in her practical way: \xe2\x80\x9cThen\r\nI suppose we may talk about you to Susy now?\xe2\x80\x9d--and thereafter all five\r\naddressed themselves to the vision of their imminent holiday.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment the little house became the centre of a whirlwind.\r\nTreats so unforeseen, and of such magnitude, were rare in the young\r\nFulmers\xe2\x80\x99 experience, and had it not been for Junie\xe2\x80\x99s steadying influence\r\nSusy\xe2\x80\x99s charges would have got out of hand. But young Nat, appealed to\r\nby Nick on the ground of their common manhood, was induced to forego\r\ncelebrating the event on his motor horn (the very same which had\r\ntortured the New Hampshire echoes), and to assert his authority over\r\nhis juniors; and finally a plan began to emerge from the chaos, and each\r\nchild to fit into it like a bit of a picture puzzle.\r\n\r\nSusy, riding the whirlwind with her usual firmness, nevertheless felt an\r\nundercurrent of anxiety. There had been no time as yet, between her and\r\nNick, to revert to money matters; and where there was so little money\r\nit could not, obviously, much matter. But that was the more reason for\r\nbeing secretly aghast at her intrepid resolve not to separate herself\r\nfrom her charges. A three days\xe2\x80\x99 honey-moon with five children in the\r\nparty--and children with the Fulmer appetite--could not but be a costly\r\nbusiness; and while she settled details, packed them off to school, and\r\nrouted out such nondescript receptacles as the house contained in the\r\nway of luggage, her thoughts remained fixed on the familiar financial\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nYes--it was cruel to have it rear its hated head, even through the\r\nbursting boughs of her new spring; but there it was, the perpetual\r\nserpent in her Eden, to be bribed, fed, sent to sleep with such scraps\r\nas she could beg, borrow or steal for it. And she supposed it was the\r\nprice that fate meant her to pay for her blessedness, and was surer than\r\never that the blessedness was worth it. Only, how was she to compound\r\nthe business with her new principles?\r\n\r\nWith the children\xe2\x80\x99s things to pack, luncheon to be got ready, and the\r\nFontainebleau pension to be telephoned to, there was little time to\r\nwaste on moral casuistry; and Susy asked herself with a certain irony\r\nif the chronic lack of time to deal with money difficulties had not been\r\nthe chief cause of her previous lapses. There was no time to deal with\r\nthis question either; no time, in short, to do anything but rush forward\r\non a great gale of plans and preparations, in the course of which she\r\nwhirled Nick forth to buy some charcuterie for luncheon, and telephone\r\nto Fontainebleau.\r\n\r\nOnce he was gone--and after watching him safely round the corner--she\r\ntoo got into her wraps, and transferring a small packet from her\r\ndressing-case to her pocket, hastened out in a different direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIT took two brimming taxi-cabs to carry the Nicholas Lansings to the\r\nstation on their second honey-moon. In the first were Nick, Susy and the\r\nluggage of the whole party (little Nat\xe2\x80\x99s motor horn included, as a last\r\nconcession, and because he had hitherto forborne to play on it); and in\r\nthe second, the five Fulmers, the bonne, who at the eleventh hour had\r\nrefused to be left, a cage-full of canaries, and a foundling kitten who\r\nhad murderous designs on them; all of which had to be taken because, if\r\nthe bonne came, there would be nobody left to look after them.\r\n\r\nAt the corner Susy tore herself from Nick\xe2\x80\x99s arms and held up the\r\nprocession while she ran back to the second taxi to make sure that the\r\nbonne had brought the house-key. It was found of course that she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbut that Junie had; whereupon the caravan got under way again, and\r\nreached the station just as the train was starting; and there, by some\r\nmiracle of good nature on the part of the guard, they were all packed\r\ntogether into an empty compartment--no doubt, as Susy remarked, because\r\ntrain officials never failed to spot a newly-married couple, and treat\r\nthem kindly.\r\n\r\nThe children, sentinelled by Junie, at first gave promise of superhuman\r\ngoodness; but presently their feelings overflowed, and they were not to\r\nbe quieted till it had been agreed that Nat should blow his motor-horn\r\nat each halt, while the twins called out the names of the stations, and\r\nGeordie, with the canaries and kitten, affected to change trains.\r\n\r\nLuckily the halts were few; but the excitement of travel, combined\r\nwith over-indulgence in the chocolates imprudently provided by Nick,\r\noverwhelmed Geordie with a sudden melancholy that could be appeased only\r\nby Susy\xe2\x80\x99s telling him stories till they arrived at Fontainebleau.\r\n\r\nThe day was soft, with mild gleams of sunlight on decaying foliage;\r\nand after luggage and livestock had been dropped at the pension Susy\r\nconfessed that she had promised the children a scamper in the forest,\r\nand buns in a tea-shop afterward. Nick placidly agreed, and darkness\r\nhad long fallen, and a great many buns been consumed, when at length\r\nthe procession turned down the street toward the pension, headed by Nick\r\nwith the sleeping Geordie on his shoulder, while the others, speechless\r\nwith fatigue and food, hung heavily on Susy.\r\n\r\nIt had been decided that, as the bonne was of the party, the children\r\nmight be entrusted to her for the night, and Nick and Susy establish\r\nthemselves in an adjacent hotel. Nick had flattered himself that\r\nthey might remove their possessions there when they returned from the\r\ntea-room; but Susy, manifestly surprised at the idea, reminded him\r\nthat her charges must first be given their supper and put to bed. She\r\nsuggested that he should meanwhile take the bags to the hotel, and\r\npromised to join him as soon as Geordie was asleep.\r\n\r\nShe was a long time coming, but waiting for her was sweet, even in a\r\ndeserted hotel reading-room insufficiently heated by a sulky stove; and\r\nafter he had glanced through his morning\xe2\x80\x99s mail, hurriedly thrust into\r\nhis pocket as he left Paris, he sank into a state of drowsy beatitude.\r\nIt was all the maddest business in the world, yet it did not give him\r\nthe sense of unreality that had made their first adventure a mere golden\r\ndream; and he sat and waited with the security of one in whom dear\r\nhabits have struck deep roots. In this mood of acquiescence even the\r\npresence of the five Fulmers seemed a natural and necessary consequence\r\nof all the rest; and when Susy at length appeared, a little pale and\r\ntired, with the brooding inward look that busy mothers bring from the\r\nnursery, that too seemed natural and necessary, and part of the new\r\norder of things.\r\n\r\nThey had wandered out to a cheap restaurant for dinner; now, in the damp\r\nDecember night, they were walking back to the hotel under a sky full of\r\nrain-clouds. They seemed to have said everything to each other, and yet\r\nbarely to have begun what they had to tell; and at each step they took,\r\ntheir heavy feet dragged a great load of bliss.\r\n\r\nIn the hotel almost all the lights were already out; and they groped\r\ntheir way to the third floor room which was the only one that Susy\r\nhad found cheap enough. A ray from a street-lamp struck up through the\r\nunshuttered windows; and after Nick had revived the fire they drew their\r\nchairs close to it, and sat quietly for a while in the dark.\r\n\r\nTheir silence was so sweet that Nick could not make up his mind to break\r\nit; not to do so gave his tossing spirit such a sense of permanence, of\r\nhaving at last unlimited time before him in which to taste his joy and\r\nlet its sweetness stream through him. But at length he roused himself to\r\nsay: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s queer how things coincide. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a little bit of good news\r\nin one of the letters I got this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusy took the announcement serenely. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you would, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncommented, as if the day had been too obviously designed for bliss to\r\nescape the notice of its dispensers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued with a thrill of pardonable pride. \xe2\x80\x9cDuring the\r\ncruise I did a couple of articles on Crete--oh, just travel-impressions,\r\nof course; they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more. But the editor of the New Review\r\nhas accepted them, and asks for others. And here\xe2\x80\x99s his cheque, if you\r\nplease! So you see you might have let me take the jolly room downstairs\r\nwith the pink curtains. And it makes me awfully hopeful about my book.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had expected a rapturous outburst, and perhaps some reassertion\r\nof wifely faith in the glorious future that awaited The Pageant of\r\nAlexander; and deep down under the lover\xe2\x80\x99s well-being the author felt a\r\nfaint twinge of mortified vanity when Susy, leaping to her feet, cried\r\nout, ravenously and without preamble: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Nick, Nick--let me see how\r\nmuch they\xe2\x80\x99ve given you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe flourished the cheque before her in the firelight. \xe2\x80\x9cA couple of\r\nhundred, you mercenary wretch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh--\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped, as if the good news had been almost too much for\r\nher tense nerves; and then surprised him by dropping to the ground, and\r\nburying her face against his knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSusy, my Susy,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, his hand on her shaking shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\r\ndear, what is it? You\xe2\x80\x99re not crying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Nick, Nick--two hundred? Two hundred dollars? Then I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to tell\r\nyou--oh now, at once!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA faint chill ran over him, and involuntarily his hand drew back from\r\nher bowed figure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow? Oh, why now?\xe2\x80\x9d he protested. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth does it matter\r\nnow--whatever it is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it does matter--it matters more than you can think!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe straightened herself, still kneeling before him, and lifted her head\r\nso that the firelight behind her turned her hair into a ruddy halo. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nNick, the bracelet--Ellie\xe2\x80\x99s bracelet.... I\xe2\x80\x99ve never returned it to her,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she faltered out.\r\n\r\nHe felt himself recoiling under the hands with which she clutched his\r\nknees. For an instant he did not remember what she alluded to; it was\r\nthe mere mention of Ellie Vanderlyn\xe2\x80\x99s name that had fallen between them\r\nlike an icy shadow. What an incorrigible fool he had been to think they\r\ncould ever shake off such memories, or cease to be the slaves of such a\r\npast!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bracelet?--Oh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, suddenly understanding, and feeling\r\nthe chill mount slowly to his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the bracelet... Oh, Nick, I meant to give it back at once; I\r\ndid--I did; but the day you went away I forgot everything else. And when\r\nI found the thing, in the bottom of my bag, weeks afterward, I thought\r\neverything was over between you and me, and I had begun to see Ellie\r\nagain, and she was kind to me and how could I?\xe2\x80\x9d To save his life he\r\ncould have found no answer, and she pressed on: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so this morning,\r\nwhen I saw you were frightened by the expense of bringing all the\r\nchildren with us, and when I felt I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave them, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nleave you either, I remembered the bracelet; and I sent you off to\r\ntelephone while I rushed round the corner to a little jeweller\xe2\x80\x99s where\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d been before, and pawned it so that you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay for the\r\nchildren.... But now, darling, you see, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got all that money, I\r\ncan get it out of pawn at once, can\xe2\x80\x99t I, and send it back to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe flung her arms about him, and he held her fast, wondering if the\r\ntears he felt were hers or his. Still he did not speak; but as he\r\nclasped her close she added, with an irrepressible flash of her old\r\nirony: \xe2\x80\x9cNot that Ellie will understand why I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it. She\xe2\x80\x99s never yet\r\nbeen able to make out why you returned her scarf-pin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a long time she continued to lean against him, her head on his\r\nknees, as she had done on the terrace of Como on the last night of their\r\nhoneymoon. She had ceased to talk, and he sat silent also, passing\r\nhis hand quietly to and fro over her hair. The first rapture had been\r\nsucceeded by soberer feelings. Her confession had broken up the frozen\r\npride about his heart, and humbled him to the earth; but it had also\r\nroused forgotten things, memories and scruples swept aside in the first\r\nrush of their reunion. He and she belonged to each other for always:\r\nhe understood that now. The impulse which had first drawn them\r\ntogether again, in spite of reason, in spite of themselves almost, that\r\ndeep-seated instinctive need that each had of the other, would never\r\nagain wholly let them go. Yet as he sat there he thought of Strefford,\r\nhe thought of Coral Hicks. He had been a coward in regard to Coral, and\r\nSusy had been sincere and courageous in regard to Strefford. Yet his\r\nmind dwelt on Coral with tenderness, with compunction, with remorse; and\r\nhe was almost sure that Susy had already put Strefford utterly out of\r\nher mind.\r\n\r\nIt was the old contrast between the two ways of loving, the man\xe2\x80\x99s way\r\nand the woman\xe2\x80\x99s; and after a moment it seemed to Nick natural enough\r\nthat Susy, from the very moment of finding him again, should feel\r\nneither pity nor regret, and that Strefford should already be to her\r\nas if he had never been. After all, there was something Providential in\r\nsuch arrangements.\r\n\r\nHe stooped closer, pressed her dreaming head between his hands, and\r\nwhispered: \xe2\x80\x9cWake up; it\xe2\x80\x99s bedtime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose; but as she moved away to turn on the light he caught her hand\r\nand drew her to the window. They leaned on the sill in the darkness,\r\nand through the clouds, from which a few drops were already falling,\r\nthe moon, labouring upward, swam into a space of sky, cast her troubled\r\nglory on them, and was again hidden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x80\x99s The Glimpses of the Moon, by Edith Wharton\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE GLIMPSES OF THE MOON ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1263-0.txt or 1263-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/2/6/1263/\r\n\r\nProduced by Dean Gilley\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
