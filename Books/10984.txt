WORSTER\r\n\r\n\r\n[ORIGINAL TITLE "MARKENS GRODE"]\r\n\r\n\r\n1917\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I\r\n\r\n\r\nThe long, long road over the moors and up into the forest--who trod it\r\ninto being first of all? Man, a human being, the first that came here.\r\nThere was no path before he came. Afterward, some beast or other,\r\nfollowing the faint tracks over marsh and moorland, wearing them\r\ndeeper; after these again some Lapp gained scent of the path, and took\r\nthat way from field to field, looking to his reindeer. Thus was made\r\nthe road through the great Almenning--the common tracts without an\r\nowner; no-man\'s-land.\r\n\r\nThe man comes, walking toward the north. He bears a sack, the first\r\nsack, carrying food and some few implements. A strong, coarse fellow,\r\nwith a red iron beard, and little scars on face and hands; sites of\r\nold wounds--were they gained in toil or fight? Maybe the man has been\r\nin prison, and is looking for a place to hide; or a philosopher,\r\nmaybe, in search of peace. This or that, he comes; the figure of a man\r\nin this great solitude. He trudges on; bird and beast are silent all\r\nabout him; now and again he utters a word or two; speaking to himself.\r\n"Eyah--well, well...."--so he speaks to himself. Here and there, where\r\nthe moors give place to a kindlier spot, an open space in the midst of\r\nthe forest, he lays down the sack and goes exploring; after a while\r\nhe returns, heaves the sack to his shoulder again, and trudges on. So\r\nthrough the day, noting time by the sun; night falls, and he throws\r\nhimself down on the heather, resting on one arm.\r\n\r\nA few hours\' rest, and he is on the move again: "Eyah,\r\nwell...."--moving northward again, noting time by the sun; a meal of\r\nbarley cakes and goats\' milk cheese, a drink of water from the stream,\r\nand on again. This day too he journeys, for there are many kindly\r\nspots in the woods to be explored. What is he seeking? A place, a\r\npatch of ground? An emigrant, maybe, from the homestead tracts; he\r\nkeeps his eyes alert, looking out; now and again he climbs to the top\r\nof a hill, looking out. The sun goes down once more.\r\n\r\nHe moves along the western side of a valley; wooded ground, with leafy\r\ntrees among the spruce and pine, and grass beneath. Hours of this, and\r\ntwilight is falling, but his ear catches the faint purl of running\r\nwater, and it heartens him like the voice of a living thing. He climbs\r\nthe slope, and sees the valley half in darkness below; beyond, the sky\r\nto the south. He lies down to rest.\r\n\r\nThe morning shows him a range of pasture and woodland. He moves down,\r\nand there is a green hillside; far below, a glimpse of the stream,\r\nand a hare bounding across. The man nods his head, as it were\r\napprovingly--the stream is not so broad but that a hare may cross it\r\nat a bound. A white grouse sitting close upon its nest starts up at\r\nhis feet with an angry hiss, and he nods again: feathered game and\r\nfur--a good spot this. Heather, bilberry, and cloudberry cover the\r\nground; there are tiny ferns, and the seven-pointed star flowers of\r\nthe winter-green. Here and there he stops to dig with an iron tool,\r\nand finds good mould, or peaty soil, manured with the rotted wood and\r\nfallen leaves of a thousand years. He nods, to say that he has found\r\nhimself a place to stay and live: ay, he will stay here and live. Two\r\ndays he goes exploring the country round, returning each evening to\r\nthe hillside. He sleeps at night on a bed of stacked pine; already he\r\nfeels at home here, with a bed of pine beneath an overhanging rock.\r\n\r\nThe worst of his task had been to find the place; this no-man\'s place,\r\nbut his. Now, there was work to fill his days. He started at once,\r\nstripping birch bark in the woods farther off, while the sap was still\r\nin the trees. The bark he pressed and dried, and when he had gathered\r\na heavy load, carried it all the miles back to the village, to be sold\r\nfor building. Then back to the hillside, with new sacks of food and\r\nimplements; flour and pork, a cooking-pot, a spade--out and back along\r\nthe way he had come, carrying loads all the time. A born carrier of\r\nloads, a lumbering barge of a man in the forest--oh, as if he loved\r\nhis calling, tramping long roads and carrying heavy burdens; as if\r\nlife without a load upon one\'s shoulders were a miserable thing, no\r\nlife for him.\r\n\r\nOne day he came up with more than the load he bore; came leading three\r\ngoats in a leash. He was proud of his goats as if they had been horned\r\ncattle, and tended them kindly. Then came the first stranger passing,\r\na nomad Lapp; at sight of the goats, he knew that this was a man who\r\nhad come to stay, and spoke to him.\r\n\r\n"You going to live here for good?"\r\n\r\n"Ay," said the man.\r\n\r\n"What\'s your name?"\r\n\r\n"Isak. You don\'t know of a woman body anywhere\'d come and help?"\r\n\r\n"No. But I\'ll say a word of it to all I meet."\r\n\r\n"Ay, do that. Say I\'ve creatures here, and none to look to them."\r\n\r\nThe Lapp went on his way. Isak--ay, he would say a word of that. The\r\nman on the hillside was no runaway; he had told his name. A runaway?\r\nHe would have been found. Only a worker, and a hardy one. He set about\r\ncutting winter fodder for his goats, clearing the ground, digging a\r\nfield, shifting stones, making a wall of stones. By the autumn he had\r\nbuilt a house for himself, a hut of turf, sound and strong and warm;\r\nstorms could not shake it, and nothing could burn it down. Here was\r\na home; he could go inside and shut the door, and stay there; could\r\nstand outside on the door-slab, the owner of that house, if any should\r\npass by. There were two rooms in the hut; for himself at the one end,\r\nand for his beasts at the other. Farthest in, against the wall of\r\nrock, was the hayloft. Everything was there.\r\n\r\nTwo more Lapps come by, father and son. They stand resting with both\r\nhands on their long staves, taking stock of the hut and the clearing,\r\nnoting the sound of the goat-bells up on the hillside.\r\n\r\n"_Goddag_" say the Lapps. "And here\'s fine folk come to live." Lapps\r\ntalk that way, with flattering words.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know of any woman hereabouts to help?" says Isak, thinking\r\nalways of but one thing.\r\n\r\n"Woman to help? No. But we\'ll say a word of it."\r\n\r\n"Ay, if you\'d be so good. That I\'ve a house and a bit of ground here,\r\nand goats, but no woman to help. Say that."\r\n\r\nOh, he had sought about for a woman to help each time he had been down\r\nto the village with his loads of bark, but there was none to be found.\r\nThey would look at him, a widow or an old unmarried one or so, but all\r\nafraid to offer, whatever might be in their minds. Isak couldn\'t tell\r\nwhy. Couldn\'t tell why? Who would go as help to live with a man in the\r\nwilds, ever so many miles away--a whole day\'s journey to the nearest\r\nneighbour? And the man himself was no way charming or pleasant by his\r\nlooks, far from it; and when he spoke it was no tenor with eyes to\r\nheaven, but a coarse voice, something like a beast\'s.\r\n\r\nWell, he would have to manage alone.\r\n\r\nIn winter, he made great wooden troughs, and sold them in the village,\r\ncarrying sacks of food and tools back through the snow; hard days when\r\nhe was tied to a load. There were the goats, and none to look to them;\r\nhe could not be away for long. And what did he do? Need made him wise;\r\nhis brain was strong and little used; he trained it up to ever more\r\nand more. His first way was to let the goats loose before starting off\r\nhimself, so that they could get a full feed among the undergrowth\r\nin the woods. But he found another plan. He took a bucket, a great\r\nvessel, and hung it up by the river so that a single drop fell in at a\r\ntime, taking fourteen hours to fill it. When it was full to the brim,\r\nthe weight was right; the bucket sank, and in doing so, pulled a line\r\nconnected with the hayloft; a trap-door opened, and three bundles of\r\nfodder came through--the goats were fed.\r\n\r\nThat was his way.\r\n\r\nA bright idea; an inspiration, maybe, sent from God. The man had none\r\nto help him but himself. It served his need until late in the autumn;\r\nthen came the first snow, then rain, then snow again, snowing all the\r\ntime. And his machine went wrong; the bucket was filled from above,\r\nopening the trap too soon. He fixed a cover over, and all went well\r\nagain for a time; then came winter, the drop of water froze to an\r\nicicle, and stopped the machine for good.\r\n\r\nThe goats must do as their master--learn to do without.\r\n\r\nHard times--the man had need of help, and there was none, yet still he\r\nfound a way. He worked and worked at his home; he made a window in the\r\nhut with two panes of real glass, and that was a bright and wonderful\r\nday in his life. No need of lighting fires to see; he could sit\r\nindoors and work at his wooden troughs by daylight. Better days,\r\nbrighter days ... eyah!\r\n\r\nHe read no books, but his thoughts were often with God; it was\r\nnatural, coming of simplicity and awe. The stars in the sky, the wind\r\nin the trees, the solitude and the wide-spreading snow, the might\r\nof earth and over earth filled him many times a day with a deep\r\nearnestness. He was a sinner and feared God; on Sundays he washed\r\nhimself out of reverence for the holy day, but worked none the less as\r\nthrough the week.\r\n\r\nSpring came; he worked on his patch of ground, and planted potatoes.\r\nHis livestock multiplied; the two she-goats had each had twins, making\r\nseven in all about the place. He made a bigger shed for them, ready\r\nfor further increase, and put a couple of glass panes in there too.\r\nAy, \'twas lighter and brighter now in every way.\r\n\r\nAnd then at last came help; the woman he needed. She tacked about for\r\na long time, this way and that across the hillside, before venturing\r\nnear; it was evening before she could bring herself to come down. And\r\nthen she came--a big, brown-eyed girl, full-built and coarse, with\r\ngood, heavy hands, and rough hide brogues on her feet as if she\r\nhad been a Lapp, and a calfskin bag slung from her shoulders. Not\r\naltogether young; speaking politely; somewhere nearing thirty.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to fear; but she gave him greeting and said hastily:\r\n"I was going cross the hills, and took this way, that was all."\r\n\r\n"Ho," said the man. He could barely take her meaning, for she spoke in\r\na slovenly way, also, she kept her face turned aside.\r\n\r\n"Ay," said she, "\'tis a long way to come."\r\n\r\n"Ay, it\'s that," says the man. "Cross the hills, you said?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And what for?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve my people there."\r\n\r\n"Eh, so you\'ve your people there? And what\'s your name?"\r\n\r\n"Inger. And what\'s yours?"\r\n\r\n"Isak."\r\n\r\n"Isak? H\'m. D\'you live here yourself, maybe?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, here, such as it is."\r\n\r\n"Why, \'tis none so bad," said she to please him.\r\n\r\nNow he had grown something clever to think out the way of things, and\r\nit struck him then she\'d come for that very business and no other; had\r\nstarted out two days back just to come here. Maybe she had heard of\r\nhis wanting a woman to help.\r\n\r\n"Go inside a bit and rest your feet," said he.\r\n\r\nThey went into the hut and took a bit of the food she had brought, and\r\nsome of his goats\' milk to drink; then they made coffee, that she had\r\nbrought with her in a bladder. Settled down comfortably over their\r\ncoffee until bedtime. And in the night, he lay wanting her, and she\r\nwas willing.\r\n\r\nShe did not go away next morning; all that day she did not go, but\r\nhelped about the place; milked the goats, and scoured pots and things\r\nwith fine sand, and got them clean. She did not go away at all. Inger\r\nwas her name. And Isak was his name.\r\n\r\nAnd now it was another life for the solitary man. True, this wife of\r\nhis had a curious slovenly way of speech, and always turning her face\r\naside, by reason of a hare-lip that she had, but that was no matter.\r\nSave that her mouth was disfigured, she would hardly have come to\r\nhim at all; he might well be grateful for that she was marked with a\r\nhare-lip. And as to that, he himself was no beauty. Isak with the iron\r\nbeard and rugged body, a grim and surly figure of a man; ay, as a man\r\nseen through a flaw in the window-pane. His look was not a gentle one;\r\nas if Barabbas might break loose at any minute. It was a wonder Inger\r\nherself did not run away.\r\n\r\nShe did not run away. When he had been out, and came home again, there\r\nwas Inger at the hut; the two were one, the woman and the hut.\r\n\r\nIt was another mouth for him to feed, but no loss in that; he had\r\nmore freedom now, and could go and stay as he needed. And there were\r\nmatters to be looked to away from home. There was the river; pleasant\r\nto look at, and deep and swift besides; a river not to be despised;\r\nit must come from some big water up in the hills. He got himself some\r\nfishing gear and went exploring; in the evening he came back with\r\na basket of trout and char. This was a great thing to Inger, and a\r\nmarvel; she was overwhelmed, being no way used to fine dishes. She\r\nclapped her hands and cried out: "Why! Wherever...." And she was not\r\nslow to see how he was pleased at her surprise, and proud of it, for\r\nshe said more in the same strain--oh, she had never seen the like, and\r\nhow had he ever managed to find such things!\r\n\r\nInger was a blessing, too, in other ways. No clever head nor great in\r\nwit, maybe--but she had two lambing ewes with some of her kinsfolk,\r\nand brought them down. It was the best they could have wished for at\r\nthe hut; sheep with wool and lambs four new head to their stock about\r\nthe place; it was growing, getting bigger; a wonder and a marvel how\r\ntheir stock was grown. And Inger brought more; clothes, and little\r\ntrifles of her own, a looking-glass and a string of pretty glass\r\nbeads, a spinning-wheel, and carding-combs. Why, if she went on that\r\ngait the hut would soon be filled from floor to roof and no room for\r\nmore! Isak was astonished in his turn at all this wealth of goods, but\r\nbeing a silent man and slow to speak, he said nothing, only shambled\r\nout to the door-slab and looked at the weather, and shambled in again.\r\nAy, he had been lucky indeed; he felt himself more and more in love,\r\nor drawn towards her, or whatever it might be.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve no call to fetch along all such stuff," said he. "Tis more\r\nthan\'s needed."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve more if I like to fetch it. And there\'s uncle Sivert\r\nbesides--you\'ve heard of him?" "No."\r\n\r\n"Why, he\'s a rich man, and district treasurer besides."\r\n\r\nLove makes a fool of the wise. Isak felt he must do something grand\r\nhimself, and overdid it. "What I was going to say; you\'ve no need to\r\nbother with hoeing potatoes. I\'ll do it myself the evening, when I\r\ncome home."\r\n\r\nAnd he took his ax and went off to the woods.\r\n\r\nShe heard him felling in the woods, not so far off; she could hear\r\nfrom the crash that he was felling big timber. She listened for a\r\nwhile, and then went out to the potato field and set to work hoeing.\r\nLove makes fools wise.\r\n\r\nIsak came home in the evening, hauling a huge trunk by a rope. Oh,\r\nthat simple and innocent Isak, he made all the noise he could with his\r\ntree-trunk, and coughed and hemmed, all for her to come out and wonder\r\nat him. And sure enough:\r\n\r\n"Why, you\'re out of your senses," said Inger when she came out. "Is\r\nthat work for a man single-handed?" He made no answer; wouldn\'t have\r\nsaid a word for anything. To do a little more than was work for a man\r\nsingle-handed was nothing to speak of--nothing at all. A stick of\r\ntimber--huh! "And what are you going to do with it?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, we\'ll see," he answered carelessly, as if scarcely heeding she\r\nwas there.\r\n\r\nBut when he saw that she had hoed the potatoes after all he was not\r\npleased. It was as if she had done almost as much as he; and that was\r\nnot to his liking. He slipped the rope from the tree-trunk and went\r\noff with it once more.\r\n\r\n"What, haven\'t you done yet?"\r\n\r\n"No," said he gruffly.\r\n\r\nAnd he came back with another stick like the last, only with no noise\r\nnor sign of being out of breath; hauled it up to the hut like an ox,\r\nand left it there.\r\n\r\nThat summer he felled a mass of timber, and brought it to the hut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\n\r\n\r\nInger packed up some food one day in her calfskin bag. "I\'d thought of\r\ngoing across to see my people, just how they\'re faring."\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Isak.\r\n\r\n"I must have a bit of talk with them about things."\r\n\r\nIsak did not go out at once to see her off, but waited quite a while.\r\nAnd when at last he shambled out, looking never the least bit anxious,\r\nnever the least bit miserable and full of fear, Inger was all but\r\nvanished already through the fringe of the forest.\r\n\r\n"Hem!" He cleared his throat, and called, "Will you be coming back\r\nmaybe?" He had not meant to ask her that, but....\r\n\r\n"Coming back? Why, what\'s in your mind? Of course I\'ll be coming\r\nback."\r\n\r\n"H\'m."\r\n\r\nSo he was left alone again--eyah, well ...! With his strength, and the\r\nlove of work that was in him, he could not idle in and out about the\r\nhut doing nothing; he set to, clearing timber, felling straight, good\r\nsticks, and cutting them flat on two sides. He worked at this all\r\nthrough the day, then he milked the goats and went to bed.\r\n\r\nSadly bare and empty now in the hut; a heavy silence clung about\r\nthe peat walls and the earthen floor; a deep and solemn loneliness.\r\nSpinning-wheel and carding-combs were in their place; the beads, too,\r\nwere safe as they had been, stowed away in a bag under the roof. Inger\r\nhad taken nothing of her belongings. But Isak, unthinkably simple as\r\nhe was, grew afraid of the dark in the light summer nights, and saw\r\nShapes and Things stealing past the window. He got up before dawn,\r\nabout two o\'clock by the light, and ate his breakfast, a mighty dish\r\nof porridge to last the day, and save the waste of time in cooking\r\nmore. In the evening he turned up new ground, to make a bigger field\r\nfor the potatoes.\r\n\r\nThree days he worked with spade and ax by turns; Inger should be\r\ncoming on the next. \'Twould be but reasonable to have a platter of\r\nfish for her when she came--but the straight road to the water lay by\r\nthe way she would come, and it might seem.... So he went a longer way;\r\na new way, over the hills where he had never been before. Grey rock\r\nand brown, and strewed about with bits of heavy stone, heavy as copper\r\nor lead. There might be many things in those heavy stones; gold or\r\nsilver, like as not--he had no knowledge of such things, and did not\r\ncare. He came to the water; the fly was up, and the fish were biting\r\nwell that night. He brought home a basket of fish that Inger would\r\nopen her eyes to see! Going back in the morning by the way he had\r\ncome, he picked up a couple of the heavy little stones among the\r\nhills; they were brown, with specks of dark blue here and there, and\r\nwondrous heavy in the hand.\r\n\r\nInger had not come, and did not come. This was the fourth day. He\r\nmilked the goats as he had used to do when he lived alone with them\r\nand had no other to help; then he went up to a quarry near by and\r\ncarried down stones; great piles of carefully chosen blocks and\r\nflakes, to build a wall. He was busy with no end of things.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth evening, he turned in to rest with a little fear at his\r\nheart--but there were the carding-combs and spinning-wheel, and the\r\nstring of beads. Sadly empty and bare in the hut, and never a sound;\r\nthe hours were long, and when at last he did hear something like a\r\nsound of footsteps outside, he told himself that it was fancy, nothing\r\nmore. "Eyah, _Herregud_!" [Footnote: Literally, "Lord God." The word\r\nis frequently used, as here, in a sense of resignation, as it were a\r\nsigh.] he murmured, desolate in spirit. And Isak was not one to use\r\nwords lightly. There was the tramping of feet again outside, and a\r\nmoment after something gliding past the window; something with horns,\r\nsomething alive. He sprang up, over to the door, and lo, a vision!\r\n"God or the devil," muttered Isak, who did not use words lightly. He\r\nsaw a cow; Inger and a cow, vanishing into the shed.\r\n\r\nIf he had not stood there himself and heard it--Inger talking softly\r\nto the cow in the shed--he would not have believed. But there he\r\nstood. And all at once a black misgiving came into his mind: a clever\r\nwife, ay, a manager of wonders--but, after all.... No, it was too\r\nmuch, and that was the only word for it. A spinning-wheel and\r\ncarding-combs at a pinch; even the beads perhaps, though they were\r\nover fine to be come by in any way proper and natural. But a cow,\r\npicked up straying on the road, maybe, or in a field--it would be\r\nmissed in no time, and have to be found.\r\n\r\nInger stepped out of the shed, and said with a proud little laugh:\r\n\r\n"It\'s only me. I\'ve brought my cow along."\r\n\r\n"H\'m," said Isak.\r\n\r\n"It was that made me so long--I couldn\'t go but softly with her over\r\nthe hills."\r\n\r\n"And so you\'ve brought a cow?" said he.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said she, all ready to burst with greatness and riches on\r\nearth. "Don\'t you believe me, perhaps?"\r\n\r\nIsak feared the worst, but made no sign, and only said:\r\n\r\n"Come inside and get something to eat."\r\n\r\n"Did you see her? Isn\'t she a pretty cow?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, a fine cow," said Isak. And speaking as carelessly as he could,\r\nhe asked, "Where d\'you get her?"\r\n\r\n"Her name\'s Goldenhorns. What\'s that wall to be for you\'ve been\r\nbuilding up here? You\'ll work yourself to death, you will. Oh, come\r\nand look at the cow, now, won\'t you?"\r\n\r\nThey went out to look, and Isak was in his underclothes, but that was\r\nno matter. They looked and looked the cow all over carefully, in every\r\npart, and noted all the markings, head and shoulders, buttocks and\r\nthighs, where it was red and white, and how it stood.\r\n\r\n"How old d\'you think she might be?" asked Isak cautiously.\r\n\r\n"Think? Why, she\'s just exactly a tiny way on in her fourth year. I\r\nbrought her up myself, and they all said it was the sweetest calf\r\nthey\'d ever seen. But will there be feed enough here d\'you think?"\r\n\r\nIsak began to believe, as he was only too willing to do, that all was\r\nwell. "As for the feed, why, there\'ll be feed enough, never fear."\r\n\r\nThen they went indoors to eat and drink and make an evening together.\r\nThey lay awake talking of Cow; of the great event. "And isn\'t she a\r\ndear cow, too? Her second\'s on the way. And her name\'s Goldenhorns.\r\nAre you asleep, Isak?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"And what do you think, she knew me again; knew me at once, and\r\nfollowed me like a lamb. We lay up in the hills a bit last night."\r\n\r\n"Ho?"\r\n\r\n"But she\'ll have to be tied up through the summer, all the same, or\r\nshe\'ll be running off. A cow\'s a cow."\r\n\r\n"Where\'s she been before?" asked Isak at last.\r\n\r\n"Why, with my people, where she belonged. And they were quite sorry to\r\nlose her, I can tell you; and the little ones cried when I took her\r\naway."\r\n\r\nCould she be making it all up, and coming out with it so pat? No, it\r\nwasn\'t thinkable. It must be true, the cow was hers. Ho, they were\r\ngetting well-to-do, with this hut of theirs, this farm of theirs; why,\r\n\'twas good enough for any one. Ay, they\'d as good as all they could\r\nwish for already. Oh, that Inger; he loved her and she loved him\r\nagain; they were frugal folk; they lived in primitive wise, and lacked\r\nfor nothing. "Let\'s go to sleep!" And they went to sleep. And wakened\r\nin the morning to another day, with things to look at, matters to see\r\nto, once again; ay, toil and pleasure, ups and downs, the way of life.\r\n\r\nAs, for instance, with those timber baulks--should he try to fit them\r\nup together? Isak had kept his eyes about him down in the village,\r\nwith that very thing in mind, and seen how it was done; he could build\r\nwith timber himself, why not? Moreover, it was a call upon him;\r\nit must be done. Hadn\'t they a farm with sheep, a farm with a cow\r\nalready, goats that were many already and would be more?--their live\r\nstock alone was crowding them out of the turf hut; something must be\r\ndone. And best get on with it at once, while the potatoes were still\r\nin flower, and before the haytime began. Inger would have to lend a\r\nhand here and there.\r\n\r\nIsak wakes in the night and gets up, Inger sleeping fine and sound\r\nafter her long tramp, and out he goes to the cowshed. Now it must not\r\nbe thought that he talked to Cow in any obsequious and disgustful\r\nflattery; no, he patted her decently, and looked her over once more in\r\nevery part, to see if there should, by chance, be any sign, any mark\r\nof her belonging to strange owners. No mark, no sign, and Isak steals\r\naway relieved.\r\n\r\nThere lies the timber. He falls to, rolling the baulks, then lifting\r\nthem, setting them up against the wall in a framework; one big frame\r\nfor a parlour, and a smaller one--there must be a room to sleep in. It\r\nwas heavy work, hard-breathing work, and his mind being set on it, he\r\nforgot the time. There comes a smoke from the roof-hole of the hut,\r\nand Inger steps out and calls to breakfast.\r\n\r\n"And what are you busy with now?" asked Inger.\r\n\r\n"You\'re early about," says Isak, and that was all.\r\n\r\nHo, that Isak with his secrets and his lordly ways! But it pleased\r\nhim, maybe, to have her asking and wondering, and curious about his\r\ndoings. He ate a bit, and sat for a while in the hut before going out\r\nagain. What could he be waiting for?\r\n\r\n"H\'m," says he at last, getting up. "This won\'t do. Can\'t sit here\r\nidling today. Work to be done."\r\n\r\n"Seems like you\'re building," says Inger. "What?"\r\n\r\nAnd he answered condescendingly, this great man who went about\r\nbuilding with timber all by himself, he answered: "Why, you can see as\r\nmuch, I take it."\r\n\r\n"Yes.... Yes, of course."\r\n\r\n"Building--why, there\'s no help for it as I can see.. Here\'s you come\r\nbringing a whole cow to the farm--that means a cowshed, I suppose?"\r\n\r\nPoor Inger, not so eternally wise as he, as Isak, that lord of\r\ncreation. And this was before she learned to know him, and reckon with\r\nhis way of putting things. Says Inger:\r\n\r\n"Why, it\'s never a cowshed you\'re building, surely?"\r\n\r\n"Ho," says he.\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t mean it? I--I thought you\'d be building a house first."\r\n\r\n"Think so?" says Isak, putting up a face as if he\'d never in life have\r\nthought of that himself.\r\n\r\n"Why yes. And put the beasts in the hut."\r\n\r\nIsak thought for a bit. "Ay, maybe \'twould be best so."\r\n\r\n"There," says Inger, all glad and triumphant. "You see I\'m some good\r\nafter all."\r\n\r\n"Ay, that\'s true. And what\'d you say to a house with two rooms in?"\r\n\r\n"_Two_ rooms? Oh ...! Why, \'twould be just like other folks. Do you\r\nthink we could?"\r\n\r\nThey did. Isak he went about building, notching his baulks and fitting\r\nup his framework; also he managed a hearth and fireplace of picked\r\nstones, though this last was troublesome, and Isak himself was not\r\nalways pleased with his work. Haytime came, and he was forced to\r\nclimb down from his building and go about the hillsides far and near,\r\ncutting grass and bearing home the hay in mighty loads. Then one rainy\r\nday he must go down to the village.\r\n\r\n"What you want in the village?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I can\'t say exactly as yet...."\r\n\r\nHe set off, and stayed away two days, and came Back with a\r\ncooking-stove--a barge of a man surging up through the forest with\r\na whole iron stove on his back. "\'Tis more than a man can do," said\r\nInger. "You\'ll kill yourself that gait." But Isak pulled down the\r\nstone hearth, that didn\'t look so well in the new house, and set\r\nup the cooking-stove in its place. "\'Tisn\'t every one has a\r\ncooking-stove," said Inger. "Of all the wonders, how we\'re getting\r\non!..."\r\n\r\nHaymaking still; Isak bringing in loads and masses of hay, for\r\nwoodland grass is not the same as meadow grass, more\'s the pity, but\r\npoorer by far. It was only on rainy days now that he could spare time\r\nfor his building; \'twas a lengthy business, and even by August, when\r\nall the hay was in, safely stored under the shelter of the rock, the\r\nnew house was still but half-way done. Then by September: "This won\'t\r\ndo," said Isak. "You\'d better run down to the village and get a man to\r\nhelp." Inger had been something poorly of late, and didn\'t run much\r\nnow, but all the same she got herself ready to go.\r\n\r\nBut Isak had changed his mind again; had put on his lordly manner\r\nagain, and said he would manage by himself. "No call to bother with\r\nother folk," says he; "I can manage it alone."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis more than one man\'s work," says Inger. "You\'ll wear yourself\r\nout."\r\n\r\n"Just help me to hoist these up," says Isak, and that was all.\r\n\r\nOctober came, and Inger had to give up. This was a hard blow, for the\r\nroof-beams must be got up at any cost, and the place covered in before\r\nthe autumn rains; there was not a day to be lost. What could be wrong\r\nwith Inger? Not going to be ill? She would make cheese now and then\r\nfrom the goats\' milk, but beyond that she did little save shifting\r\nGoldenhorns a dozen times a day where she grazed.\r\n\r\n"Bring up a good-sized basket, or a box," she had said, "next time\r\nyou\'re down to the village."\r\n\r\n"What d\'you want that for?" asked Isak.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll just be wanting it," said Inger.\r\n\r\nIsak hauled up the roof-beams on a rope, Inger guiding them with one\r\nhand; it seemed a help just to have her about. Bit by bit the work\r\nwent on; there was no great height to the roof, but the timber was\r\nhuge and heavy for a little house.\r\n\r\nThe weather kept fine, more or less. Inger got the potatoes in by\r\nherself, and Isak had the roofing done before the rain came on in\r\nearnest. The goats were brought in of a night into the hut and all\r\nslept there together; they managed somehow, they managed everyway, and\r\ndid not grumble.\r\n\r\nIsak was getting ready for another journey down to the village. Said\r\nInger very humbly:\r\n\r\n"Do you think perhaps you could bring up a good-sized basket, or a\r\nbox?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve ordered some glass windows," said Isak. "and a couple of painted\r\ndoors. I\'ll have to fetch them up," said he in his lordly way.\r\n\r\n"Ay well, then. It\'s no great matter about the basket."\r\n\r\n"What did you want with a basket? What\'s it for?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s it for?... Oh, haven\'t you eyes in your head!"\r\n\r\nIsak went off deep in thought. Two days later he came back, with a\r\nwindow and a door for the parlour, and a door for the bedroom; also he\r\nhad hung round his neck in front a good-sized packing-case, and full\r\nof provisions to boot.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll carry yourself to death one day," said Inger.\r\n\r\n"Ho, indeed!" Isak was very far indeed from being dead; he took out\r\na bottle of medicine from his pocket--naphtha it was--and gave it to\r\nInger with orders to take it regularly and get well again. And there\r\nwere the windows and the painted doors that he could fairly boast of;\r\nhe set to work at once fitting them in. Oh, such little doors, and\r\nsecondhand at that, but painted up all neat and fine again in red and\r\nwhite; \'twas almost as good as having pictures on the walls.\r\n\r\nAnd now they moved into the new building, and the animals had the turf\r\nhut to themselves, only a lambing ewe was left with Cow, lest she\r\nshould feel lonely.\r\n\r\nThey had done well, these builders in the waste: ay, \'twas a wonder\r\nand a marvel to themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\n\r\n\r\nIsak worked on the land until the frost act in; there were stones and\r\nroots to be dug up and cleared away, and the meadow to be levelled\r\nready for next year. When the ground hardened, he left his field work\r\nand became a woodman, felling and cutting up great quantities of logs.\r\n\r\n"What do you want with all these logs?" Inger would say.\r\n\r\n"Oh, they\'ll be useful some way," said Isak off-handedly, as though he\r\nhad no plan. But Isak had a plan, never fear. Here was virgin forest,\r\na dense growth, right close up to the house, a barrier hedging in\r\nhis fields where he wanted room. Moreover, there must be some way of\r\ngetting the logs down to the village that winter; there were folk\r\nenough would be glad of wood for firing. It was sound enough, and Isak\r\nwas in no doubt; he stuck to his work in the forest, felling trees and\r\ncutting them up into logs.\r\n\r\nInger came out often, to watch him at work. He took no notice, but\r\nmade as if her coming were no matter, and not at all a thing he wished\r\nfor her to do; but she understood all the same that it pleased him to\r\nhave her there. They had a strange way, too, of speaking to each other\r\nat times.\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t you find things to do but come out here and get stark\r\nfrozen?" says Isak.\r\n\r\n"I\'m well enough for me," says Inger. "But I can\'t see there\'s any\r\nliving sense in you working yourself to death like you do."\r\n\r\n"Ho! You just pick up that coat of mine there and put it on you."\r\n\r\n"Put on your coat? Likely, indeed. I\'ve no time to sit here now, with\r\nGoldenhorns ready to calve and all."\r\n\r\n"H\'m, Calving, you say?"\r\n\r\n"As if you didn\'t know! But what do you think now about that same\r\ncalf. Let it stay and be weaned, maybe?"\r\n\r\n"Do as you think; \'tis none of my business with calves and things."\r\n\r\n"Well, \'twould be a pity to eat up calf, seems to me. And leave us\r\nwith but one cow on the place."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t seem to me like you\'d do that anyway," says Isak.\r\n\r\nThat was their way. Lonely folk, ugly to look at and overfull of\r\ngrowth, but a blessing for each other, for the beasts, and for the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nAnd Goldenhorns calved. A great day in the wilderness, a joy and a\r\ndelight. They gave her flour-wash, and Isak himself saw to it there\r\nwas no stint of flour, though he had carried it all the way himself,\r\non his back. And there lay a pretty calf, a beauty, red-flanked like\r\nher mother, and comically bewildered at the miracle of coming into the\r\nworld. In a couple of years she would be having calves of her own.\r\n\r\n"\'Twill be a grand fine cow when she grows up," said Inger. "And what\r\nare we to call her, now? I can\'t think."\r\n\r\nInger was childish in her ways, and no clever wit for anything.\r\n\r\n"Call her?" said Isak. "Why, Silverhorns, of course; what else?"\r\n\r\nThe first snow came. As soon as there was a passable road, Isak set\r\nout for the village, full of concealment and mystery as ever, when\r\nInger asked his errand. And sure enough, he came back this time with a\r\nnew and unthinkable surprise. A horse and sledge, nothing less.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s foolishness," says Inger. "And you\'ve not stolen it, I\r\nsuppose?"\r\n\r\n"Stolen it?"\r\n\r\n"Well, found it, then?"\r\n\r\nNow if only he could have said: "\'Tis my horse--our horse...." But\r\nto tell the truth, he had only hired it, after all. Hired horse and\r\nsledge to cart his logs.\r\n\r\nIsak drove down with his loads of firewood, and brought back food,\r\nherrings and flour. And one day he came up with a young bull on the\r\nsledge; bought it for next to nothing, by reason they were getting\r\nshort of fodder down in the village. Shaggy and thin, no ways a\r\nbeauty, but decently built for all that, and wanted no more than\r\nproper feed to set it right. And with a cow they had already....\r\n\r\n"What\'ll you be bringing up next?" said Inger.\r\n\r\nIsak brought up a host of things. Brought up planks and a saw he had\r\ngot in exchange for timber; a grindstone, a wafer iron, tools--all\r\nin exchange for his logs. Inger was bursting with riches, and said\r\neach time: "What, more things! When we\'ve cattle and all a body could\r\nthink of!"\r\n\r\nThey had enough to meet their needs for no little time to come, and\r\nwere well-to-do folk. What was Isak to start on again next spring? He\r\nhad thought it all out, tramping down beside his loads of wood that\r\nwinter; he would clear more ground over the hillside and level it off,\r\ncut up more logs to dry through the summer, and take down double loads\r\nwhen the snow came fit for sledging. It worked out beautifully.\r\n\r\nBut there was another matter Isak had thought of times out of number:\r\nthat Goldenhorns, where had she come from, whose had she been? There\r\nwas never a wife on earth like Inger. Ho! a wild thing she was, that\r\nlet him do as he pleased with her, and was glad of it. But--suppose\r\none day they were to come for the cow, and take it away--and worse,\r\nmaybe, to come after? What was it Inger herself had said about the\r\nhorse: "You haven\'t stolen it, I suppose, or found it?" That was her\r\nfirst thought, yes. That was what she had said; who could say if she\r\nwere to be trusted--what should he do? He had thought of it all many\r\na time. And here he had brought up a mate himself for the cow--for a\r\nstolen cow, maybe!\r\n\r\nAnd there was the horse he would have to return again. A pity--for\r\n\'twas a little friendly beast, and grown fond of them already.\r\n\r\n"Never mind," said Inger comfortingly. "Why, you\'ve done wonders\r\nalready."\r\n\r\n"Ay, but just now with the spring coming on--and I\'ve need of a\r\nhorse...."\r\n\r\nNext morning he drove off quietly with the last load, and was away two\r\ndays. Coming back on foot the third day, he stopped as he neared the\r\nhouse, and stood listening. There was a curious noise inside.... A\r\nchild crying--Eyah, _Herregud_!... Well, there it was; but a terrible\r\nstrange thing. And Inger had never said a word.\r\n\r\nHe stepped inside, and there first thing of all was the\r\npacking-case--the famous packing-case that he had carried home slung\r\nround his neck in front; there it was, hung up by a string at each end\r\nfrom the ceiling, a cradle and a bedplace for the child. Inger was up,\r\npottering about half-dressed--she had milked the cow and the goats, as\r\nit might have been just an ordinary day.\r\n\r\nThe child stopped crying. "You\'re through with it already?" said Isak.\r\n\r\n"Ay, I\'m through with it now."\r\n\r\n"H\'m."\r\n\r\n"It came the first evening you were gone."\r\n\r\n"H\'m."\r\n\r\n"I\'d only to get my things off and hang up the cradle there, but it\r\nwas too much for me, like, and I had to lie down."\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you tell me before?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I couldn\'t say to a minute when it\'d be. \'Tis a boy."\r\n\r\n"Ho, a boy."\r\n\r\n"And I can\'t for the life of me think what we\'re to call him," said\r\nInger.\r\n\r\nIsak peeped at the little red face; well shaped it was, and no\r\nhare-lip, and a growth of hair all thick on the head. A fine little\r\nfellow for his rank and station in a packing-case; Isak felt himself\r\ncuriously weak. The rugged man stood there with a miracle before him;\r\na thing created first of all in a sacred mist, showing forth now in\r\nlife with a little face like an allegory. Days and years, and the\r\nmiracle would be a human being.\r\n\r\n"Come and have your food," said Inger....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIsak is a woodman, felling trees and sawing logs. He is better off now\r\nthan before, having a saw. He works away, and mighty piles of wood\r\ngrow up; he makes a street of them, a town, built up of stacks and\r\npiles of wood. Inger is more about the house now, and does not come\r\nout as before to watch him at his work; Isak must find a pretext now\r\nand then to slip off home for a moment instead. Queer to have a little\r\nfellow like that about the place! Isak, of course, would never dream\r\nof taking any notice--\'twas but a bit of a thing in a packing-case.\r\nAnd as for being fond of it ... But when it cried, well, it was only\r\nhuman nature to feel just a little something for a cry like that; a\r\nlittle tiny cry like that.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t touch him!" says Inger. "With your hands all messed up with\r\nresin and all!"\r\n\r\n"Resin, indeed!" says Isak. "Why, I haven\'t had resin on my hands\r\nsince I built this house. Give me the boy, let me take him--there,\r\nhe\'s as right as can be!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEarly in May came a visitor. A woman came over the hills to that\r\nlonely place where none ever came; she was of Inger\'s kinsfolk, though\r\nnot near, and they made her welcome.\r\n\r\n"I thought I\'d just look in," she says, "and see how Goldenhorns gets\r\non since she left us."\r\n\r\nInger looks at the child, and talks to it in a little pitying voice:\r\n"Ah, there\'s none asks how he\'s getting on, that\'s but a little tiny\r\nthing."\r\n\r\n"Why, as for that, any one can see how he\'s getting on. A fine little\r\nlad and all. And who\'d have thought it a year gone, Inger, to find you\r\nhere with house and husband and child and all manner of things."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis no doing of mine to praise. But there\'s one sitting there that\r\ntook me as I was and no more."\r\n\r\n"And wedded?--Not wedded yet, no, I see."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll see about it, the time this little man\'s to be christened,"\r\nsays Inger. "We\'d have been wedded before, but couldn\'t come by it,\r\ngetting down to a church and all. What do you say, Isak?"\r\n\r\n"Wedded?" says Isak. "Why, yes, of course."\r\n\r\n"But if as you\'d help us, Oline," says Inger. "Just to come up for a\r\nfew days in the off time once, and look to the creatures here while\r\nwe\'re away?"\r\n\r\nAy, Oline would do that.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll see it\'s no loss to you after."\r\n\r\nWhy, as to that, she\'d leave it to them.... "And you\'re building\r\nagain, I see. Now what\'ll that be for? Isn\'t there built enough?"\r\n\r\nInger sees her chance and puts in here: "Why, you must ask him about\r\nthat. I\'m not to know."\r\n\r\n"Building?" says Isak. "Oh, \'tis nothing to speak of. A bit of a\r\nshed, maybe, if we should need it. What\'s that you were saying about\r\nGoldenhorns? You\'d like to see her?"\r\n\r\nThey go across to the cowshed, and there\'s cow and calf to show, and\r\nan ox to boot. The visitor nods her head, looking at the beasts, and\r\nat the shed; all fine as could be, and clean as couldn\'t be cleaner.\r\n"Trust Inger for looking after creatures every way," says Oline.\r\n\r\nIsak puts a question: "Goldenhorns was at your place before?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, from a calf. Not my place, though; at my son\'s. But \'tis all the\r\nsame. And we\'ve her mother still."\r\n\r\nIsak had not heard better news a long while; it was a burden lighter.\r\nGoldenhorns was his and Inger\'s by honest right. To tell the truth, he\r\nhad half thought of getting rid of his trouble in a sorry way; to kill\r\noff the cow that autumn, scrape the hide, bury the horns, and thus\r\nmake away with all trace of Cow Goldenhorns in this life. No need for\r\nthat now. And he grew mightily proud of Inger all at once.\r\n\r\n"Ay, Inger," says he. "She\'s one to manage things, that\'s true.\r\nThere\'s not her like nor equal to be found. \'Twas a poor place here\r\ntill I got a woman of my own, as you might say."\r\n\r\n"Why, \'tis but natural so," says Oline.\r\n\r\nAnd so this woman from across the hills, a soft-spoken creature with\r\nher wits about her, and by name Oline, she stayed with them a couple\r\nof days, and had the little room to sleep in. And, when she set out\r\nfor home, she had a bundle of wool that Inger had given her, from the\r\nsheep. There was no call to hide that bundle of wool, but Oline took\r\ncare that Isak should not see it.\r\n\r\nThen the child and Isak and his wife again; the same world again, and\r\nthe work of the day, with many little joys and big. Goldenhorns was\r\nyielding well, the goats had dropped their kids and were yielding\r\nwell; Inger had a row of red and white cheeses already, stored away to\r\nget ripe. It was her plan to save up cheeses till there were enough to\r\nbuy a loom. Oh, that Inger; she knew how to weave.\r\n\r\nAnd Isak built a shed--he too had a plan of his own, no doubt. He set\r\nup a new wing built out from the side of the turf hut, with double\r\npanelling boards, made a doorway in it, and a neat little window with\r\nfour panes; laid on a roof of outer boards, and made do with that\r\ntill the ground thawed and he could get turf. All that was useful and\r\nnecessary; no flooring, no smooth-planed walls, but Isak had fixed up\r\na box partition, as for a horse, and a manger.\r\n\r\nIt was nearing the end of May. The sun had thawed the high ground;\r\nIsak roofed in his shed with turf and it was finished. Then one\r\nmorning he ate a meal to last for the day, took some more food with\r\nhim, shouldered pick and spade, and went down to the village.\r\n\r\n"Bring up three yards of cotton print, if you can," Inger called after\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"What do you want with that?" said Isak.\r\n\r\nIsak was long away; it almost seemed as if he had gone for good. Inger\r\nlooked at the weather every day, noting the way of the wind, as if she\r\nwere expecting a sailing-ship; she went out at nighttime to listen;\r\neven thought of taking the child on her arm and going after him. Then\r\nat last he came back, with a horse and cart. "_Piro_!" shouted Isak as\r\nhe drew up; shouted so as to be heard. And the horse was well behaved,\r\nand stood as quiet as could be, nodding at the turf hut as if it knew\r\nthe place again. Nevertheless, Isak must call out, "Hi, come and hold\r\nthe horse a bit, can\'t you?"\r\n\r\nOut goes Inger. "Where is it now? Oh, Isak, have you hired him again?\r\nWhere have you been all this time? \'Tis six days gone."\r\n\r\n"Where d\'you think I\'d be? Had to go all sorts of ways round to find a\r\nroad for this cart of mine. Hold the horse a bit, can\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Cart of yours! You don\'t mean to say you\'ve bought that cart?"\r\n\r\nIsak dumb; Isak swelling with things unspoken. He lifts out a plough\r\nand a harrow he has brought; nails, provisions, a grindstone, a sack\r\nof corn. "And how\'s the child?" he asks.\r\n\r\n"Child\'s all right. Have you bought that cart, that\'s what I want to\r\nknow? For here have I been longing and longing for a loom," says she\r\njestingly, in her gladness at having him back again.\r\n\r\nIsak dumb once more, for a long space, busied with his own affairs,\r\npondering, looking round for a place to put all his goods and\r\nimplements; it was hard to find room for them all. But when Inger gave\r\nup asking, and began talking to the horse instead, he came out of his\r\nlofty silence at last.\r\n\r\n"Ever see a farm _without_ a horse and cart, and plough and harrows,\r\nand all the rest of it? And since you want to know, why, I\'ve bought\r\nthat horse and cart, and all that\'s in it," says he.\r\n\r\nAnd Inger could only shake her head and murmur: "Well, I never did see\r\nsuch a man!"\r\n\r\nIsak was no longer littleness and humility; he had paid, as it were,\r\nlike a gentleman, for Goldenhorns. "Here you are," he could say. "I\'ve\r\nbrought along a horse; we can call it quits."\r\n\r\nHe stood there, upright and agile, against his wont; shifted the\r\nplough once more, picked it up and carried it with one hand and stood\r\nit up against the wall. Oh, he could manage an estate! He took up the\r\nother things: the harrow, the grindstone, a new fork he had bought,\r\nall the costly agricultural implements, treasures of the new home, a\r\ngrand array. All requisite appliances--nothing was lacking.\r\n\r\n"H\'m. As for that loom, why, we\'ll manage that too, I dare say, as\r\nlong as I\'ve my health. And there\'s your cotton print; they\'d none but\r\nblue, so I took that."\r\n\r\nThere was no end to the things he brought. A bottomless well, rich in\r\nall manner of things, like a city store.\r\n\r\nSays Inger: "I wish Oline could have seen all this when she was here."\r\n\r\nJust like a woman! Sheer senseless vanity--as if that mattered! Isak\r\nsniffed contemptuously. Though perhaps he himself would not have been\r\ndispleased if Oline had been there to see.\r\n\r\nThe child was crying.\r\n\r\n"Go in and look after the boy," said Isak. "I\'ll look to the horse."\r\n\r\nHe takes out the horse and leads it into the stable: ay, here is Isak\r\nputting his horse into the stable. Feeds it and strokes it and\r\ntreats it tenderly. And how much was owing now, on that horse and\r\ncart?--Everything, the whole sum, a mighty debt; but it should all be\r\npaid that summer, never fear. He had stacks of cordwood to pay with,\r\nand some building bark from last year\'s cut, not to speak of heavy\r\ntimber. There was time enough. But later on, when the pride and glory\r\nhad cooled off a little, there were bitter hours of fear and anxiety;\r\nall depended on the summer and the crops; how the year turned out.\r\n\r\nThe days now were occupied in field work and more field work; he\r\ncleared new bits of ground, getting out roots and stones; ploughing,\r\nmanuring, harrowing, working with pick and spade, breaking lumps of\r\nsoil and crumbling them with hand and heel; a tiller of the ground\r\nalways, laying out fields like velvet carpets. He waited a couple of\r\ndays longer--there was a look of rain about--and then he sowed his\r\ncorn.\r\n\r\nFor generations back, into forgotten time, his fathers before him had\r\nsowed corn; solemnly, on a still, calm evening, best with a gentle\r\nfall of warm and misty rain, soon after the grey goose flight.\r\nPotatoes were a new thing, nothing mystic, nothing religious; women\r\nand children could plant them--earth-apples that came from foreign\r\nparts, like coffee; fine rich food, but much like swedes and mangolds.\r\nCorn was nothing less than bread; corn or no corn meant life or death.\r\n\r\nIsak walked bareheaded, in Jesu name, a sower. Like a tree-stump with\r\nhands to look at, but in his heart like a child. Every cast was made\r\nwith care, in a spirit of kindly resignation. Look! the tiny grains\r\nthat are to take life and grow, shoot up into ears, and give more\r\ncorn again; so it is throughout all the earth where corn is sown.\r\nPalestine, America, the valleys of Norway itself--a great wide world,\r\nand here is Isak, a tiny speck in the midst of it all, a sower. Little\r\nshowers of corn flung out fanwise from his hand; a kindly clouded sky,\r\nwith a promise of the faintest little misty rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the slack time between the seasons, but the woman Oline did not\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nIsak was free of the soil now; he had two scythes and two rakes ready\r\nfor the haymaking; he made long bottom boards for the cart for getting\r\nin the hay, and procured a couple of runners and some suitable wood\r\nto make a sledge for the winter. Many useful things he did. Even to\r\nshelves. He set up a pair of shelves inside the house, as an excellent\r\nplace to keep various things, such as an almanac--he had bought one at\r\nlast--and ladles and vessels not in use. Inger thought a deal of those\r\ntwo shelves.\r\n\r\nInger was easily pleased; she thought a great deal of everything.\r\nThere was Goldenhorns, for instance, no fear of her running away now,\r\nwith the calf and bull to play with; she ran about in the woods all\r\nday long. The goats too were thriving, their heavy udders almost\r\ndragging on the ground. Inger made a long robe of blue cotton print,\r\nand a little cap of the same stuff, as pretty as could be--and that\r\nwas for the christening. The boy himself watched her at work many a\r\ntime; a blessed wonder of a boy he was, and if she was so bent on\r\ncalling him Eleseus, why, Isak supposed she must have her way. When\r\nthe robe was finished, it had a long train to it, nigh on a yard and\r\na half of cotton print, and every inch of it money spent; but what of\r\nthat--the child was their first-born.\r\n\r\n"What about those beads of yours?" said Isak. "If as they\'re ever to\r\nbe used at all...."\r\n\r\nOh, but Inger had thought of them already, those beads of hers. Trust\r\na mother for that. Inger said nothing, and was very proud. The beads\r\nwere none so many; they would not make a necklace for the boy, but\r\nthey would look pretty stitched on the front of his cap, and there\r\nthey should be.\r\n\r\nBut Oline did not come.\r\n\r\nIf it had not been for the cattle, they could have gone off all three\r\nof them, and come back a few days later with the child properly\r\nchristened. And if it had not been for that matter of getting wedded,\r\nInger might have gone by herself.\r\n\r\n"If we put off the wedding business for a bit?" said Isak. But Inger\r\nwas loth to put it off; it would be ten or twelve years at least\r\nbefore Eleseus was old enough to stay behind and look to the milking\r\nwhile they went.\r\n\r\nNo, Isak must use his brains to find a way. The whole thing had come\r\nabout somehow without their knowing; maybe the wedding business was\r\njust as important as the christening--how should he know? The weather\r\nlooked like drought--a thoroughly wicked drought; if the rain did not\r\ncome before long, their crops would be burnt up. But all was in the\r\nhand of God. Isak made ready to go down to the village and find some\r\none to come up. All those miles again!\r\n\r\nAnd all that fuss just to be wed and christened. Ay, outlying folks\r\nhad many troubles, great and small.\r\n\r\nAt last Oline did come....\r\n\r\nAnd now they were wedded and christened, everything decently in order;\r\nthey had remembered to have the wedding first, so the child could be\r\nchristened as of a wedded pair. But the drought kept on, and the tiny\r\ncornfields were parched, those velvet carpets parched--and why? \'Twas\r\nall in the hand of God. Isak mowed his bits of meadow; there was\r\nlittle grass on them for all he had manured them well that spring. He\r\nmowed and mowed on the hillsides, farther and farther out; mowing and\r\nturning and carting home loads of hay, as if he would never tire,--for\r\nhe had a horse already, and a well-stocked farm. But by mid-July he\r\nhad to cut the corn for green fodder, there was no help for it. And\r\nnow all depended on the potato crop.\r\n\r\nWhat was that about potatoes? Were they just a thing from foreign\r\nparts, like coffee; a luxury, an extra? Oh, the potato is a lordly\r\nfruit; drought or downpour, it grows and grows all the same. It laughs\r\nat the weather, and will stand anything; only deal kindly with it, and\r\nit yields fifteen-fold again. Not the blood of a grape, but the flesh\r\nof a chestnut, to be boiled or roasted, used in every way. A man may\r\nlack corn to make bread, but give him potatoes and he will not starve.\r\nRoast them in the embers, and there is supper; boil them in water, and\r\nthere\'s a breakfast ready. As for meat, it\'s little is needed beside.\r\nPotatoes can be served with what you please; a dish of milk, a\r\nherring, is enough. The rich eat them with butter; poor folk manage\r\nwith a tiny pinch of salt. Isak could make a feast of them on Sundays,\r\nwith a mess of cream from Goldenhorns\' milk. Poor despised potato--a\r\nblessed thing!\r\n\r\nBut now--things look black even for the potato crop.\r\n\r\nIsak looked at the sky unnumbered times in the day. And the sky was\r\nblue. Many an evening it looked as if a shower were coming. Isak would\r\ngo in and say, "Like as not we\'ll be getting that rain after all." And\r\na couple of hours later all would be as hopeless as before.\r\n\r\nThe drought had lasted seven weeks now, and the heat was serious;\r\nthe potatoes stood all the time in flower; flowering marvellously,\r\nunnaturally. The cornfields looked from a distance as if under snow.\r\nWhere was it all to end? The almanac said nothing--almanacs nowadays\r\nwere not what they used to be; an almanac now was no good at all. Now\r\nit looked like rain again, and Isak went in to Inger: "We\'ll have rain\r\nthis night, God willing."\r\n\r\n"Is it looking that way?"\r\n\r\n"Ay. And the horse is shivering a bit, like they will."\r\n\r\nInger glanced towards the door and said, "Ay, you see, \'twill come\r\nright enough."\r\n\r\nA few drops fell. Hours passed, they had their supper, and when Isak\r\nwent out in the night to look, the sky was blue.\r\n\r\n"Well, well," said Inger; "anyway, \'twill give the last bit of lichen\r\nanother day to dry," said she to comfort him all she could.\r\n\r\nIsak had been getting lichen, as much as he could, and had a fine lot,\r\nall of the best. It was good fodder, and he treated it as he would\r\nhay, covering it over with bark in the woods. There was only a\r\nlittle still left out, and now, when Inger spoke of it, he answered\r\ndespairingly, as if it were all one, "I\'ll not take it in if it is\r\ndry."\r\n\r\n"Isak, you don\'t mean it!" said Inger.\r\n\r\nAnd next day, sure enough, he did not take it in. He left it out and\r\nnever touched it, just as he had said. Let it stay where it was,\r\nthere\'d be no rain anyway; let it stay where it was in God\'s name!\r\nHe could take it in some time before Christmas, if so be as the sun\r\nhadn\'t burnt it all up to nothing.\r\n\r\nIsak was deeply and thoroughly offended. It was no longer a pleasure\r\nand a delight to sit outside on the door-slab and look out over his\r\nlands and be the owner of it all. There was the potato field flowering\r\nmadly, and drying up; let the lichen stay where it was--what did he\r\ncare? That Isak! Who could say; perhaps he had a bit of a sly little\r\nthought in his mind for all his stolid simpleness; maybe he knew what\r\nhe was doing after all, trying to tempt the blue sky now, at the\r\nchange of the moon.\r\n\r\nThat evening it looked like rain once more. "You ought to have got\r\nthat lichen in," said Inger.\r\n\r\n"What for?" said Isak, looking all surprised.\r\n\r\n"Ay, you with your nonsense--but it might be rain after all."\r\n\r\n"There\'ll be no rain this year, you can see for yourself."\r\n\r\nBut for all that, it grew curiously dark in the night. They could see\r\nthrough the glass window that it was darker--ay, and as if something\r\nbeat against the panes, something wet, whatever it might be. Inger\r\nwoke up. "\'Tis rain! look at the window-panes."\r\n\r\nBut Isak only sniffed. "Rain?--not a bit of it. Don\'t know what you\'re\r\ntalking about."\r\n\r\n"Ah, it\'s no good pretending," said Inger.\r\n\r\nIsak was pretending--ay, that was it. Rain it was, sure enough, and a\r\ngood heavy shower--but as soon as it had rained enough to spoil Isak\'s\r\nlichen, it stopped. The sky was blue. "What did I say," said Isak,\r\nstiff-necked and hard.\r\n\r\nThe shower made no difference to the potato crop, and days came and\r\nwent; the sky was blue. Isak set to work on his timber sledge, worked\r\nhard at it, and bowed his heart, and planed away humbly at runners and\r\nshafts. Eyah, _Herregud_! Ay, the days came and went, and the child\r\ngrew. Inger churned and made cheeses; there was no serious danger;\r\nfolk that had their wits about them and could work need not die for\r\nthe sake of one bad year. Moreover, after nine weeks, there came a\r\nregular blessing of rain, rain all one day and night, and sixteen\r\nhours of it pouring as hard as it could. If it had come but two weeks\r\nback, Isak would have said, "It\'s too late now!" As it was, he said to\r\nInger, "You see, that\'ll save some of the potatoes."\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Inger hopefully. "It\'ll save the lot, you\'ll see."\r\n\r\nAnd now things were looking better. Rain every day; good, thorough\r\nshowers. Everything looking green again, as by a miracle. The potatoes\r\nwere flowering still, worse than before, and with big berries growing\r\nout at the tops, which was not as it should be; but none could say\r\nwhat might be at the roots--Isak had not ventured to look. Then one\r\nday Inger went out and found over a score of little potatoes under one\r\nplant. "And they\'ve five weeks more to grow in," said Inger. Oh,\r\nthat Inger, always trying to comfort and speak hopefully through her\r\nhare-lip. It was not pretty to hear when she spoke, for a sort of\r\nhissing, like steam from a leaky valve, but a comfort all the same out\r\nin the wilds. And a happy and cheerful soul she was at all times.\r\n\r\n"I wish you could manage to make another bed," she said to Isak one\r\nday.\r\n\r\n"Ho!" said he.\r\n\r\n"Why, there\'s no hurry, but still...."\r\n\r\nThey started getting in the potatoes, and finished by Michaelmas, as\r\nthe custom is. It was a middling year--a good year; once again it was\r\nseen that potatoes didn\'t care so much about the weather, but grew up\r\nall the same, and could stand a deal. A middling year--a good year\r\n... well, not perhaps, if they worked it out exactly, but that they\r\ncouldn\'t do this year. A Lapp had passed that way one day and said how\r\nfine their potatoes were up there; it was much worse, he said, down in\r\nthe village.\r\n\r\nAnd now Isak had a few weeks more to work the ground before the frost\r\nset in. The cattle were out, grazing where they pleased; it was good\r\nto work with them about, and hear the bells, though it did take some\r\nof his time now and again. There was the bull, mischievous beast,\r\nwould take to butting at the lichen stacks; and as for the goats, they\r\nwere high and low and everywhere, even to the roof of the hut.\r\n\r\nTroubles great and small.\r\n\r\nOne day Isak heard a sudden shout; Inger stood on the door-slab with\r\nthe child in her arms, pointing over to the bull and the pretty little\r\ncow Silverhorns--they were making love. Isak threw down his pick and\r\nraced over to the pair, but it was too late, by the look of it. The\r\nmischief was done. "Oh, the little rascal, she\'s all too young--half\r\na year too soon, a child!" Isak got her into the hut, but it was too\r\nlate.\r\n\r\n"Well, well," says Inger, "\'tis none so bad after all, in a way; if\r\nshe\'d waited, we\'d have had both of them bearing at the same time."\r\nOh, that Inger; not so bright as some, maybe, yet, for all that, she\r\nmay well have known what she was about when she let the pair loose\r\ntogether that morning.\r\n\r\nWinter came, Inger carding and spinning, Isak driving down with loads\r\nof wood; fine dry wood and good going; all his debts paid off and\r\nsettled; horse and cart, plough and harrow his very own. He drove down\r\nwith Inger\'s goats\' milk cheeses, and brought back woollen thread, a\r\nloom, shuttles and beam and all; brought back flour and provisions,\r\nmore planks, and boards and nails; one day he brought home a lamp.\r\n\r\n"As true as I\'m here I won\'t believe it," says Inger. But she had\r\nlong had in her mind about a lamp for all that. They lit it the same\r\nevening, and were in paradise; little Eleseus he thought, no doubt, it\r\nwas the sun. "Look how he stares all wondering like," said Isak. And\r\nnow Inger could spin of an evening by lamplight.\r\n\r\nHe brought up linen for shirts, and new hide shoes for Inger. She had\r\nasked for some dye-stuffs, too, for the wool, and he brought them.\r\nThen one day he came back with a clock. With what?--A clock. This was\r\ntoo much for Inger; she was overwhelmed and could not say a word. Isak\r\nhung it up on the wall, and set it at a guess, wound it up, and let it\r\nstrike. The child turned its eyes at the sound and then looked at its\r\nmother. "Ay, you may wonder," said Inger, and took the child to her,\r\nnot a little touched herself. Of all good things, here in a lonely\r\nplace, there was nothing could be better than a clock to go all the\r\ndark winter through, and strike so prettily at the hours.\r\n\r\nWhen the last load was carted down, Isak turned woodman once more,\r\nfelling and stacking, building his streets, his town of wood-piles for\r\nnext winter. He was getting farther and farther from the homestead\r\nnow, there was a great broad stretch of hillside all ready for\r\ntillage. He would not cut close any more, but simply throw the biggest\r\ntrees with dry tops.\r\n\r\nHe knew well enough, of course, what Inger had been thinking of when\r\nshe asked for another bed; best to hurry up and get it ready. One dark\r\nevening he came home from the woods, and sure enough, Inger had got\r\nit over--another boy--and was lying down. That Inger! Only that very\r\nmorning she had tried to get him to go down to the village again:\r\n"\'Tis time the horse had something to do," says she. "Eating his head\r\noff all day."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no time for such-like nonsense," said Isak shortly, and went\r\nout. Now he understood; she had wanted to get him out of the way. And\r\nwhy? Surely \'twas as well to have him about the house.\r\n\r\n"Why can\'t you ever tell a man what\'s coming?" said he.\r\n\r\n"You make a bed for yourself and sleep in the little room," said\r\nInger.\r\n\r\nAs for that, it was not only a bedstead to make; there must be\r\nbedclothes to spread. They had but one skin rug, and there would be no\r\ngetting another till next autumn, when there were wethers to kill--and\r\neven then two skins would not make a blanket. Isak had a hard time,\r\nwith cold at nights, for a while; he tried burying himself in the hay\r\nunder the rock-shelter, tried to bed down for himself with the cows.\r\nIsak was homeless. Well for him that it was May; soon June would be\r\nin; July....\r\n\r\nA wonderful deal they had managed, out there in the wilderness; house\r\nfor themselves and housing for the cattle, and ground cleared and\r\ncultivated, all in three years. Isak was building again--what was he\r\nbuilding now? A new shed, a lean-to, jutting out from the house. The\r\nwhole place rang with the noise as he hammered in his eight-inch\r\nnails. Inger came out now and again and said it was trying for the\r\nlittle ones.\r\n\r\n"Ay, the little ones--go in and talk to them then, sing a bit.\r\nEleseus, he can have a bucket lid to hammer on himself. And it\'s only\r\nwhile I\'m doing these big nails just here, at the cross-beams, that\'s\r\ngot to bear the whole. Only planks after that, two-and-a-half-inch\r\nnails, as gentle as building dolls\' houses."\r\n\r\nSmall wonder if Isak hammered and thumped. There stood a barrel of\r\nherrings, and the flour, and all kinds of food-stuffs in the stable;\r\nbetter than lying out in the open, maybe, but the pork tasted of it\r\nalready; a shed they must have, and that was clear. As for the little\r\nones, they\'d get used to the noise in no time. Eleseus was inclined to\r\nbe ailing somehow, but the other took nourishment sturdily, like a fat\r\ncherub, and when he wasn\'t crying, he slept. A wonder of a child! Isak\r\nmade no objection to his being called Sivert, though he himself would\r\nrather have preferred Jacob. Inger could hit on the right thing at\r\ntimes. Eleseus was named after the priest of her parish, and that\r\nwas a fine name to be sure; but Sivert was called after his mother\'s\r\nuncle, the district treasurer, who was a well-to-do man, with neither\r\nwife nor child to come after him. They couldn\'t do better than name\r\nthe boy after him.\r\n\r\nThen came spring, and the new season\'s work; all was down in the earth\r\nbefore Whitsun. When there had been only Eleseus to look after,\r\nInger could never find time to help her husband, being tied to her\r\nfirst-born; now, with two children in the house, it was different; she\r\nhelped in the fields and managed a deal of odd work here and there;\r\nplanting potatoes, sowing carrots and turnips. A wife like that is\r\nnone so easy to find. And she had her loom besides; at all odd minutes\r\nshe would slip into the little room and weave a couple of spools,\r\nmaking half-wool stuff for underclothes for the winter. Then when she\r\nhad dyed her wools, it was red and blue dress material for herself\r\nand the little ones; at last she put in several colours, and made a\r\nbedspread for Isak all by herself. No fancy work from Inger\'s loom;\r\nuseful and necessary things, and sound all through.\r\n\r\nOh, they were doing famously, these settlers in the wilds; they had\r\ngot on so far, and if this year\'s crops turned out well they would\r\nbe enviable folk, no less. What was lacking on the place at all? A\r\nhayloft, perhaps; a big barn with a threshing-floor inside--but that\r\nmight come in time. Ay, it would come, never fear, only give then\r\ntime. And now pretty Silverhorns had calved, the sheep had lambs, the\r\ngoats had kids, the young stock fairly swarmed about the place. And\r\nwhat of the little household itself? Eleseus could walk already, walk\r\nby himself wherever he pleased, and little Sivert was christened.\r\nInger? By all signs and tokens, making ready for another turn; she was\r\nnot what you\'d call niggardly at bearing. Another child--oh, a mere\r\nnothing to Inger! Though, to be sure, she was proud enough of them\r\nwhen they came. Fine little creatures, as any one could see. \'Twas\r\nnot all, by a long way, that the Lord had blessed with such fine big\r\nchildren. Inger was young, and making the most of it. She was no\r\nbeauty, and had suffered all her girlhood by reason of the same, being\r\nset aside and looked down on. The young men never noticed her, though\r\nshe could dance and work as well. They found nothing sweet in her, and\r\nturned elsewhere. But now her time had come; she was in full flower\r\nand constantly with child. Isak himself, her lord and master, was\r\nearnest and stolid as ever, but he had got on well, and was content.\r\nHow he had managed to live till Inger came was a mystery; feeding,\r\nno doubt, on potatoes and goats\' milk, or maybe venturesome dishes\r\nwithout a name; now, he had all that a man could think of in his place\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nThere came another drought, a new bad year. Os-Anders the Lapp, coming\r\nby with his dog, brought news that folk in the village had cut their\r\ncorn already, for fodder.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis a poor look out," said Inger, "when it comes to that."\r\n\r\n"Ay. But they\'ve the herring. A fine haul, \'tis said. Your Uncle\r\nSivert, he\'s going to build a country house."\r\n\r\n"Why, he was none so badly off before."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true. And like to be the same with you, for all it seems."\r\n\r\n"Why, as to that, thank God, we\'ve enough for our little needs. What\r\ndo they say at home about me up here?"\r\n\r\nOs-Anders wags his head helplessly; there\'s no end to the great things\r\nthey say; more than he can tell. A pleasant-spoken fellow, like all\r\nthe Lapps.\r\n\r\n"If as you\'d care for a dish of milk now, you\'ve only to say so," says\r\nInger.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis more than\'s worth your while. But if you\'ve a sup for the dog\r\nhere...."\r\n\r\nMilk for Os-Anders, and food for the dog. Os-Anders lifts his head\r\nsuddenly, at a kind of music inside the house.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"\'Tis only our clock," says Inger. "It strikes the hours that way."\r\nInger bursting with pride.\r\n\r\nThe Lapp wags his head again: "House and cattle and all manner of\r\nthings. There\'s nothing a man could think of but you\'ve that thing."\r\n\r\n"Ay, we\'ve much to be thankful for, \'tis true."\r\n\r\n"I forgot to say, there\'s Oline was asking after you."\r\n\r\n"Oline? How is it with her?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s none so poorly. Where will your husband be now?"\r\n\r\n"He\'ll be at work in the fields somewhere."\r\n\r\n"They say he\'s not bought yet," says the Lapp carelessly.\r\n\r\n"Bought? Who says so?"\r\n\r\n"Why, \'tis what they say."\r\n\r\n"But who\'s he to buy from? \'Tis common land."\r\n\r\n"Ay, \'tis so."\r\n\r\n"And sweat of his brow to every spade of it."\r\n\r\n"Why, they say \'tis the State owns all the land."\r\n\r\nInger could make nothing of this. "Ay, maybe so. Was it Oline said\r\nso?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t well remember," says the Lapp, and his shifty eyes looked all\r\nways around.\r\n\r\nInger wondered why he did not beg for anything; Os-Anders always\r\nbegged, as do all the Lapps. Os-Anders sits scraping at the bowl of\r\nhis clay pipe, and and lights up. What a pipe! He puffs and draws at\r\nit till his wrinkled old face looks like a wizard\'s runes.\r\n\r\n"No need to ask if the little ones there are yours," says he,\r\nflattering again. "They\'re as like you as could be. The living image\r\nof yourself when you were small."\r\n\r\nNow Inger was a monster and a deformity to look at; \'twas all wrong,\r\nof course, but she swelled with pride for all that. Even a Lapp can\r\ngladden a mother\'s heart.\r\n\r\n"If it wasn\'t that your sack there\'s so full, I\'d find you something\r\nto put in it," says Inger.\r\n\r\n"Nay, \'tis more than\'s worth your while."\r\n\r\nInger goes inside with the child on her arm; Eleseus stays outside\r\nwith the Lapp. The two make friends at once; the child sees something\r\ncurious in the sack, something soft and fluffy, and wants to pat it.\r\nThe dog stands alert, barking and whining. Inger comes out with a\r\nparcel of food; she gives a cry, and drops down on the door-slab.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that you\'ve got there? What is it?"\r\n\r\n"Tis nothing. Only a hare."\r\n\r\n"I saw it."\r\n\r\n"\'Twas the boy wanted to look. Dog ran it down this morning and killed\r\nit, and I brought it along...."\r\n\r\n"Here\'s your food," said Inger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\n\r\n\r\nOne bad year never comes alone. Isak had grown patient, and took what\r\nfell to his lot. The corn was parched, and the hay was poor, but the\r\npotatoes looked like pulling through once more--bad enough, all things\r\ntogether, but not the worst. Isak had still a season\'s yield of\r\ncordwood and timber to sell in the village, and the herring fishery\r\nhad been rich all round the coast, so there was plenty of money to buy\r\nwood. Indeed, it almost looked like a providence that the corn harvest\r\nhad failed--for how could he have threshed it without a barn and\r\nthreshing-floor? Call it providence; there\'s no harm in that\r\nsometimes.\r\n\r\nThere were other things not so easily put out of mind. What was it a\r\ncertain Lapp had said to Inger that summer--something about not having\r\nbought? Buy, what should he buy for? The ground was there, the forest\r\nwas there; he had cleared and tilled, built up a homestead in the\r\nmidst of a natural wilderness, winning bread for himself and his,\r\nasking nothing of any man, but working, and working alone. He had\r\noften thought himself of asking the Lensmand [Footnote: Sheriff\'s\r\nofficer, in charge of a small district.] about the matter when he went\r\ndown to the village, but had always put it off; the Lensmand was not\r\na pleasant man to deal with, so people said, and Isak was not one to\r\ntalk much. What could he say if he went--what had he come for?\r\n\r\nOne day that winter the Lensmand himself came driving up to the place.\r\nThere was a man with him, and a lot of papers in a bag. Geissler\r\nhimself, the Lensmand, no less. He looked at the broad open hillside,\r\ncleared of timber, smooth and unbroken under the snow; he thought\r\nperhaps that it was all tilled land already, for he said:\r\n\r\n"Why, this is a whole big farm you\'ve got. You don\'t expect to get all\r\nthis for nothing?"\r\n\r\nThere it was! Isak was terror-stricken and said not a word.\r\n\r\n"You ought to have come to me at first, and bought the land," said\r\nGeissler.\r\n\r\n"Ay."\r\n\r\nThe Lensmand talked of valuations, of boundaries, taxes, taxes to the\r\nState, and, when he had explained the matter a little, Isak began to\r\nsee that there was something reasonable in it after all. The Lensmand\r\nturned to his companion teasingly. "Now then, you call yourself a\r\nsurveyor, what\'s the extent of cultivated ground here?" He did not\r\nwait for the other to reply, but noted down himself, at a guess. Then\r\nhe asked Isak about the crops, how much hay, how many bushels of\r\npotatoes. And then about boundaries. They could not go round the place\r\nmarking out waist-deep in snow; and in summer no one could get up\r\nthere at all. What did Isak think himself about the extent of woodland\r\nand pasturage?--Isak had no idea at all; he had always thought of the\r\nplace as being his own as far as he could see. The Lensmand said that\r\nthe State required definite boundaries. "And the greater the extent,\r\nthe more you will have to pay."\r\n\r\n"Ay."\r\n\r\n"And they won\'t give you all you think you can swallow; they\'ll let\r\nyou have what\'s reasonable for your needs."\r\n\r\n"Ay."\r\n\r\nInger brought in some milk for the visitors; they drank it, and she\r\nbrought in some more. The Lensmand a surly fellow? He stroked Eleseus\'\r\nhair, and looked at something the child was playing with. "Playing\r\nwith stones, what? Let me see. H\'m, heavy. Looks like some kind of\r\nore."\r\n\r\n"There\'s plenty such up in the hills," said Isak.\r\n\r\nThe Lensmand came back to business. "South and west from here\'s what\r\nyou want most, I suppose? Shall we say a couple of furlongs to the\r\nsouthward?"\r\n\r\n"Two furlongs!" exclaimed his assistant.\r\n\r\n"_You_ couldn\'t till two hundred yards," said his chief shortly.\r\n\r\n"What will that cost?" asked Isak.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t say. It all depends. But I\'ll put it as low as I can on my\r\nreport; it\'s miles away from anywhere, and difficult to get at."\r\n\r\n"But two furlongs!" said the assistant again.\r\n\r\nThe Lensmand entered duly, two furlongs to the southward, and asked:\r\n"What about the hills? How much do you want that way?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll need all up as far as the water. There\'s a big water up there,"\r\nsaid Isak.\r\n\r\nThe Lensmand noted that. "And how far north?"\r\n\r\n"Why, it\'s no great matter that way. \'Tis but moorland most, and\r\nlittle timber."\r\n\r\nThe Lensmand fixed the northward boundary at one furlong. "East?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s no great matter either. \'Tis bare field all from here into\r\nSweden."\r\n\r\nThe Lensmand noted down again. He made a rapid calculation, and said:\r\n"It\'ll make a good-sized place, even at that. Anywhere near the\r\nvillage, of course, it\'d be worth a lot of money; nobody could have\r\nbought it. I\'ll send in a report, and say a hundred _Daler_ would be\r\nfair. What do you think?" he asked his assistant.\r\n\r\n"It\'s giving it away," said the other.\r\n\r\n"A hundred _Daler_?" said Inger. "Isak, you\'ve no call to take so big\r\na place."\r\n\r\n"No--o," said Isak.\r\n\r\nThe assistant put in hurriedly: "That\'s just what I say. It\'s miles\r\ntoo big for you as it is. What will you do with it?"\r\n\r\n"Cultivate it," said the Lensmand.\r\n\r\nHe had been sitting there writing and working in his head, with the\r\nchildren crying every now and then; he did not want to have the whole\r\nthing to do again. As it was, he would not be home till late that\r\nnight, perhaps not before morning. He thrust the papers into the bag;\r\nthe matter was settled.\r\n\r\n"Put the horse in," he said to his companion. And turning to Isak: "As\r\na matter of fact, they ought to give you the place for nothing, and\r\npay you into the bargain, the way you\'ve worked. I\'ll say as much when\r\nI send in the report. Then we\'ll see how much the State will ask for\r\nthe title-deeds."\r\n\r\nIsak--it was hard to say how he felt about it. Half as if he were not\r\nill-pleased after all to find his land valued at a big price, after\r\nthe work he had done. As for the hundred _Daler_, he could manage to\r\npay that off, no doubt, in course of time. He made no further business\r\nabout it; he could go on working as he had done hitherto, clearing and\r\ncultivating, fetching loads of timber from the untended woodlands.\r\nIsak was not a man to look about anxiously for what might come; he\r\nworked.\r\n\r\nInger thanked the Lensmand, and hoped he would put in a word for them\r\nwith the State.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes. But I\'ve no say in the matter myself. All I have to do is\r\nto say what I have seen, and what I think. How old is the youngest\r\nthere?"\r\n\r\n"Six months as near as can be."\r\n\r\n"Boy or girl?"\r\n\r\n"Boy."\r\n\r\nThe Lensmand was no tyrant, but shallow, and not overconscientious. He\r\nignored his assistant, Brede Olsen, who by virtue of his office should\r\nbe an expert in such affairs; the matter was settled out of hand,\r\nby guesswork. Yet for Isak and his wife it was a serious matter\r\nenough--ay, and for who should come after them, maybe for generations.\r\nBut he set it all down, as it pleased him, making a document of it on\r\nthe spot. Withal a kindly man; he took a bright coin from his pocket\r\nand gave it to little Sivert; then he nodded to the others and went\r\nout to the sledge.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he asked: "What do you call the place?"\r\n\r\n"Call it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. What\'s its name? We must have a name for it"\r\n\r\nNo one had ever thought of that before. Inger and Isak looked at each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n"Sellanraa?" said the Lensmand. He must have invented it out of his\r\nown head; maybe it was not a name at all. But he only nodded, and said\r\nagain, "Sellanraa!" and drove off.\r\n\r\nSettled again, at a guess, anything would do. The name, the price, the\r\nboundaries....\r\n\r\nSome weeks later, when Isak was down in the village, he heard rumours\r\nof some business about Lensmand Geissler; there had been an inquiry\r\nabout some moneys he could not account for, and the matter had been\r\nreported to his superior. Well, such things did happen; some folk were\r\ncontent to stumble through life anyhow, till they ran up against those\r\nthat walked.\r\n\r\nThen one day Isak went down with a load of wood, and coming back, who\r\nshould drive with him on his sledge but Lensmand Geissler. He stepped\r\nout from the trees, on to the road, waved his hand, and simply said:\r\n"Take me along, will you?"\r\n\r\nThey drove for a while, neither speaking. Once the passenger took a\r\nflask from his pocket and drank; offered it to Isak, who declined.\r\n"I\'m afraid this journey will upset my stomach," said the Lensmand.\r\n\r\nHe began at once to talk about Isak\'s deal in land. "I sent off the\r\nreport at once, with a strong recommendation on my own account.\r\nSellanraa\'s a nice name. As a matter of fact, they ought to let you\r\nhave the place for nothing, wouldn\'t do to say so, of course. If I\r\nhad, they\'d only have taken offence and put their own price on it. I\r\nsuggested fifty _Daler_."\r\n\r\n"Ho. Fifty, you said? Not a hundred?"\r\n\r\nThe Lensmand puckered his brow and thought a moment. "As far as I\r\nrecollect it was fifty. Yes...."\r\n\r\n"And where will you be going, now?" asked Isak.\r\n\r\n"Over to Vesterbotten, to my wife\'s people."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis none so easy that way at this time of year."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll manage. Couldn\'t you go with me a bit?"\r\n\r\n"Ay; you shan\'t go alone."\r\n\r\nThey came to the farm, and the Lensmand stayed the night, sleeping in\r\nthe little room. In the morning, he brought out his flask again, and\r\nremarked: "I\'m sure this journey\'s going to upset my stomach." For the\r\nrest, he was much the same as last time, kindly, decisive, but fussy,\r\nand little concerned about his own affairs. Possibly it might not be\r\nso bad after all. Isak ventured to point out that the hillside was not\r\nall under cultivation yet, but only some small squares here and there.\r\nThe Lensmand took the information in a curious fashion. "I knew that\r\nwell enough, of course, last time I was here, when I made out the\r\nreport. But Brede, the fellow who was with me, he didn\'t see it.\r\nBrede, he\'s no earthly good. But they work it out by table. With all\r\nthe ground as I entered it, and only so few loads of hay, so few\r\nbushels of potatoes, they\'ll say at once that it must be poor soil,\r\ncheap soil, you understand. I did my best for you, and you take my\r\nword for it, that\'ll do the trick. It\'s two and thirty thousand\r\nfellows of your stamp the country wants."\r\n\r\nThe Lensmand nodded and turned to Inger. "How old\'s the youngest?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s just three-quarters of a year."\r\n\r\n"And a boy, is he?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"But you must see and get that business settled as soon as ever you\r\ncan," said he to Isak again. "There\'s another man wants to purchase\r\nnow, midway between here and the village, and as soon as he does,\r\nthis\'ll be worth more. You buy now, get the place first, and let the\r\nprice go up after--that way, you\'ll be getting some return for all the\r\nwork you\'ve put into it. It was you that started cultivating here at\r\nall. \'Twas all wilderness before."\r\n\r\nThey were grateful for his advice, and asked if it was not he himself\r\nthat would arrange the matter. He answered that he had done all he\r\ncould; everything now depended on the State. "I\'m going across\r\nto Vesterbotten now, and I shan\'t be coming back," he told them\r\nstraightforwardly.\r\n\r\nHe gave Inger an _Ort_, and that was overmuch. "You can take a bit of\r\nmeat down to my people in the village next time you\'re killing," said\r\nhe. "My wife\'ll pay you. Take a cheese or so, too, any time you can.\r\nThe children like it."\r\n\r\nIsak went with him up over the hills; it was firm, good going on the\r\nhigher ground, easier than below. Isak received a whole _Daler_.\r\n\r\nIn that manner was it Lensmand Geissler left the place, and he did not\r\ncome back. No great loss, folk said, he being looked on as a doubtful\r\npersonage, an adventurer. Not that he hadn\'t the knowledge; he was a\r\nlearned man, and had studied this and that, but he lived too freely,\r\nand spent other people\'s money. It came out later that he had left the\r\nplace after a sharp reprimand from his superior, Amtmand Pleym; but\r\nnothing was done about his family officially, and they went on living\r\nthere, a good while after--his wife and three children. And it was not\r\nlong before the money unaccounted for was sent from Sweden, so that\r\nGeissler\'s wife and children could not be said to be held as hostages,\r\nbut stayed on simply because it pleased them.\r\n\r\nIsak and Inger had no cause to complain of Geissler\'s dealings with\r\nthem, not by a long way. And there was no saying what sort of man\r\nhis successor would be--perhaps they would have to go over the whole\r\nbusiness again!\r\n\r\nThe Amtmand [Footnote: Governor of a country] sent one of his clerks\r\nup to the village, to be the new Lensmand. He was a man about forty,\r\nson of a local magistrate, by name Heyerdahl. He had lacked the means\r\nto go to the university and enter the service that way; instead, he\r\nhad been constrained to sit in an office, writing at a desk, for\r\nfifteen years. He was unmarried, having never been able to afford\r\na wife. His chief, Amtmand Pleym, had inherited him from his\r\npredecessor, and paid him the same miserable wage that had been given\r\nbefore; Heyerdahl took it, and went on writing at his desk as before.\r\n\r\nIsak plucked up his courage, and went to see him.\r\n\r\n"Documents in the Sellanraa case ...? Here they are, just returned\r\nfrom the Department. They want to know all sorts of things--the whole\r\nbusiness is in a dreadful muddle, as Geissler left it," said the\r\nofficial. "The Department wishes to be informed as to whether any\r\nconsiderable crop of marketable berries is to be reckoned with on the\r\nestate. Whether there is any heavy timber. Whether possibly there may\r\nbe ores or metals of value an the hills adjoining. Mention is made of\r\nwater, but nothing stated as to any fishery in the same. This Geissler\r\nappears to have furnished certain information, but he\'s not to be\r\ntrusted, and here have I to go through the whole affair again after\r\nhim. I shall have to come up to Sellanraa and make a thorough\r\ninspection and valuation. How many miles is it up there? The\r\nDepartment, of course, requires that adequate boundaries be drawn:\r\nyes, we shall have to beat the bounds in due order."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis no light business setting up boundaries this time of year," said\r\nIsak. "Not till later on in the summer."\r\n\r\n"Anyhow, it\'ll have to be done. The Department can\'t wait all through\r\nthe summer for an answer. I\'ll come up myself as soon as I can get\r\naway. I shall have to be out that way in any case, there\'s another\r\nplot of land a man\'s inquiring about."\r\n\r\n"Will that be him that\'s going to buy up between me and the village?"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t say, I\'m sure. Very likely. As a matter of fact, it\'s a man\r\nfrom the office here, my assistant in the office. He was here in\r\nGeissler\'s time. Asked Geissler about it, I understand, but Geissler\r\nput him off; said he couldn\'t cultivate a hundred yards of land. So he\r\nsent in an application to the Amtmand, and I\'m instructed to see the\r\nmatter through. More of Geissler\'s muddling!"\r\n\r\nLensmand Heyerdahl came up to the farm, and brought with him his\r\nassistant, Brede. They had got thoroughly wet crossing the moors, and\r\nwetter still they were before they\'d finished tramping the boundary\r\nlines through melting snow and slush up and down the hills. The\r\nLensmand set to work zealously the first day, but on the second he had\r\nhad enough, and contented himself with standing still for the most\r\npart, pointing and shouting directions. There was no further talk\r\nabout prospecting for ore in the "adjoining hills," and as for\r\nmarketable berries--they would have a look at the moors on the way\r\nback, he said.\r\n\r\nThe Department requested information on quite a number of\r\npoints--there were tables for all sorts of things, no doubt. The only\r\nthing that seemed reasonable was the question of timber. Certainly,\r\nthere was some heavy timber, and that within the limits of Isak\'s\r\nproposed holding, but not enough to reckon with for sale; no more than\r\nwould be required to keep up the place. Even if there had been timber\r\nin plenty, who was to carry it all the many miles to where it could\r\nbe sold? Only Isak, trundling like a tub-wheel through the forest in\r\nwinter-time carting some few heavy sticks down to the village, to\r\nbring back planks and boards for his building.\r\n\r\nGeissler, the incomprehensible, had, it seemed, sent in a report which\r\nwas not easily upset. Here was his successor going through the whole\r\nthing again, trying to find mistakes and blatant inaccuracies--but all\r\nin vain. It was noticeable that he consulted his assistant at every\r\nturn, and paid heed to what he said, which was not Geissler\'s way at\r\nall. That same assistant, moreover, must presumably have altered his\r\nown opinion, since he was now a would-be purchaser himself of lands\r\nfrom the common ground held by the State.\r\n\r\n"What about the price?" asked the Lensmand.\r\n\r\n"Fifty _Daler_ is the most they can fairly ask of any buyer," answered\r\nthe expert.\r\n\r\nLensmand Heyerdahl drew up his report in elegant phrasing. Geissler\r\nhad written: "The man will also have to pay land tax every year; he\r\ncannot afford to pay more for the place than fifty _Daler_, in annual\r\ninstalments over ten years. The State can accept his offer, or take\r\naway his land and the fruits of his work." Heyerdahl wrote: "He now\r\nhumbly begs to submit this application to the Department: that he\r\nbe allowed to retain this land, upon which, albeit without right\r\nof possession, he has up to this present effected considerable\r\nimprovements, for a purchase price of 50--fifty--_Speciedaler_,\r\nthe amount to be paid in annual instalments as may seem fit to the\r\nDepartment to apportion the same."\r\n\r\nLensmand Heyerdahl promised Isak to do his best. "I hope to succeed in\r\nprocuring you possession of the estate," he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe big bull is to be sent away. It has grown to an enormous beast,\r\nand costs too much to feed; Isak is taking it down to the village, to\r\nbring up a suitable yearling in exchange.\r\n\r\nIt was Inger\'s idea. And Inger had no doubt her own reasons for\r\ngetting Isak out of the place on that particular day.\r\n\r\n"If you are going at all, you\'d better go today," she said. "The\r\nbull\'s in fine condition; \'twill fetch a good price at this time of\r\nyear. You take him down to the village, and they\'ll send him to be\r\nsold in town--townsfolk pay anything for their meat."\r\n\r\n"Ay," says Isak.\r\n\r\n"If only the beast doesn\'t make trouble on the way down."\r\n\r\nIsak made no answer.\r\n\r\n"But he\'s been out and about now this last week, and getting used to\r\nthings."\r\n\r\nIsak was silent. He took a big knife, hung it in a sheath at his\r\nwaist, and led out the bull.\r\n\r\nA mighty beast it was, glossy-coated and terrible to look at, swaying\r\nat the buttocks as it walked. A trifle short in the leg; when it ran,\r\nit crushed down the undergrowth with its chest; it was like a railway\r\nengine. Its neck was huge almost to deformity; there was the strength\r\nof an elephant in that neck.\r\n\r\n"If only he doesn\'t get mad with you," said Inger.\r\n\r\nIsak thought for a moment. "Why, if as he takes it that way, I\'ll just\r\nhave to slaughter him half-way and carry down the meat."\r\n\r\nInger sat down on the door-slab. She was in pain; her face was aflame.\r\nShe had kept her feet till Isak was gone; now he and the bull were\r\nout of sight, and she could give way to a groan without fear. Little\r\nEleseus can talk a little already; he asks: "Mama hurt? "--"Yes,\r\nhurt." He mimics her, pressing his hands to his sides and groaning.\r\nLittle Sivert is asleep.\r\n\r\nInger takes Eleseus inside the house, gives him some things to play\r\nwith on the floor, and gets into bed herself. Her time was come. She\r\nis perfectly conscious all the while, keeps an eye on Eleseus, glances\r\nat the clock on the wall to see the time. Never a cry, hardly a\r\nmovement; the struggle is in her vitals--a burden is loosened and\r\nglides from her. Almost at the same moment she hears a strange cry in\r\nthe bed, a blessed little voice; poor thing, poor little thing ... and\r\nnow she cannot rest, but lifts herself up and looks down. What is\r\nit? Her face is grey and blank in a moment, without expression or\r\nintelligence; a groan is heard; unnatural, impossible--a choking gasp.\r\n\r\nShe slips back on the bed. A minute passes; she cannot rest, the\r\nlittle cry down there in the bed grows louder, she raises herself once\r\nmore, and sees--O God, the direst of all! No mercy, no hope--and this\r\na girl!\r\n\r\nIsak could not have gone more than a couple of miles or so. It was\r\nhardly an hour since he had left. In less than ten minutes Inger had\r\nborne her child and killed it....\r\n\r\nIsak came back on the third day, leading a half-starved yearling bull.\r\nThe beast could hardly walk; it had been a long business getting up to\r\nthe place at all.\r\n\r\n"How did you get on?" asked Inger. She herself was ill and miserable\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nIsak had managed very well. True, the big bull had been mad the last\r\ntwo miles or so, and he had to tie it up and fetch help from the\r\nvillage. Then, when he got back, it had broken loose and took a deal\r\nof time to find. But he had managed somehow, and had sold for a good\r\nprice to a trader in the village, buying up for butchers in the town.\r\n"And here\'s the new one," said Isak. "Let the children come and look."\r\n\r\nAny addition to the live stock was a great event. Inger looked at\r\nthe bull and felt it over, asked what it had cost; little Sivert was\r\nallowed to sit on its back. "I shall miss the big one, though," said\r\nInger. "So glossy and fine he was. I do hope they\'ll kill him nicely."\r\n\r\nIt was the busy season now, and there was work enough. The animals\r\nwere let loose; in the empty shed were cases and bins of potatoes left\r\nto grow. Isak sowed more corn this year than last, and did all he\r\ncould to get it nicely down. He made beds for carrots and turnips, and\r\nInger sowed the seeds. All went on as before.\r\n\r\nInger went about for some time with a bag of hay under her dress, to\r\nhide any change in her figure, taking out a little from time to time,\r\nand finally discarding the bag altogether. At last, one day, Isak\r\nnoticed something, and asked in surprise:\r\n\r\n"Why, how\'s this? Hasn\'t anything happened? I thought...."\r\n\r\n"No. Not this time."\r\n\r\n"Ho. Why, what was wrong?\r\n\r\n"\'Twas meant to be so, I suppose. Isak, how long d\'you think it\'ll\r\ntake you to work over all this land of ours?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but ... you mean you had your trouble--didn\'t go as it should?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, that was it--yes."\r\n\r\n"But yourself--you\'re not hurt anyway after it?"\r\n\r\n"No. Isak, I\'ve been thinking, we ought to have a pig."\r\n\r\nIsak was not quick to change the subject that way. He was silent a\r\nlittle, then at last he said: "Ay, a pig. I\'ve thought of that myself\r\neach spring. But we\'ll need to have more potatoes first, and more of\r\nthe small, and a bit of corn beside; we\'ve not enough to feed a pig.\r\nWe\'ll see how this year turns out."\r\n\r\n"But it would be nice to have a pig."\r\n\r\n"Ay."\r\n\r\nDays pass, rain comes, fields and meadows are looking well--oh, the\r\nyear will turn out well, never fear! Little happenings and big, all in\r\ntheir turn: food, sleep, and work; Sundays, with washing of faces and\r\ncombing of hair, and Isak sitting about in a new red shirt of Inger\'s\r\nweaving and sewing. Then an event, a happening of note in the ordinary\r\nround: a sheep, roaming with her lamb, gets caught in a cleft among\r\nthe rocks. The others come home in the evening. Inger at once sees\r\nthere are two missing, and out goes Isak in search. Isak\'s first\r\nthought is to be thankful it is Sunday, so he is not called away from\r\nhis work and losing time. He tramps off--there is an endless range\r\nof ground to be searched; and, meanwhile, the house is all anxiety.\r\nMother hushes the children with brief words; there are two sheep\r\nmissing, and they must be good. All share the feeling; what has\r\nhappened is a matter for the whole little community. Even the cows\r\nknow that something unusual is going on, and give tongue in their own\r\nfashion, for Inger goes out every now and then, calling aloud towards\r\nthe woods, though it is near night. It is an event in the wilderness,\r\na general misfortune. Now and again she gives a long-drawn hail to\r\nIsak, but there is no answer; he must be out of hearing.\r\n\r\nWhere are the sheep--what can have come to them? Is there a bear\r\nabroad? Or have the wolves come down over the hills from Sweden and\r\nFinland? Neither, as it turns out. Isak finds the ewe stuck fast in\r\na cleft of rock, with a broken leg and lacerated udder. It must have\r\nbeen there some time, for, despite its wounds, the poor thing has\r\nnibbled the grass down to the roots as far as it could reach. Isak\r\nlifts the sheep and sets it free; it falls to grazing at once. The\r\nlamb makes for its mother and sucks away--a blessed relief for the\r\nwounded udder to be emptied now.\r\n\r\nIsak gathers stones and fills up the dangerous cleft; a wicked place;\r\nit shall break no more sheep\'s thighs! Isak wears leather braces; he\r\ntakes them off now and fastens them round the sheep\'s middle, as a\r\nsupport for the udder. Then, lifting the animal on his shoulders, he\r\nsets off home, the lamb at his heels.\r\n\r\nAfter that--splints and tar bandages. In a few days\' time the patient\r\nbegins twitching the foot of the wounded leg; it is the fracture\r\naching as it grows together. Ay, all things getting well again--until\r\nnext time something happens.\r\n\r\nThe daily round; little matters that are all important to the\r\nsettler-folk themselves. Oh, they are not trifles after all, but\r\nthings of fate, making for their happiness and comfort and well-being,\r\nor against them.\r\n\r\nIn the slack time between the seasons, Isak smooths down some new\r\ntree-trunks he has thrown; to be used for something or other, no\r\ndoubt. Also he digs out a number of useful stones and gets them down\r\nto the house; as soon as there are stones enough, he builds a wall of\r\nthem. A year or so back, Inger would have been curious, wondering what\r\nher man was after with all this--now, she seemed for the most part\r\nbusied with her own work, and asked no questions. Inger is busy as\r\never, but she has taken to singing, which is something new, and she is\r\nteaching Eleseus an evening prayer; this also is something new. Isak\r\nmisses her questioning; it was her curiosity and her praise of all he\r\ndid that made him the contented man, the incomparable man he was. But\r\nnow, she goes by, saying nothing, or at most with a word or so that he\r\nis working himself to death. "She\'s troubled after that last time, for\r\nall she says," thinks Isak to himself.\r\n\r\nOline comes over to visit them once more. If all had been as before\r\nshe would have been welcome, but now it is different. Inger greets\r\nher from the first with some ill-will; be it what it may, there is\r\nsomething that makes Inger look on her as an enemy.\r\n\r\n"I\'d half a thought I\'d be coming just at the right time again," says\r\nOline, with delicate meaning.\r\n\r\n"How d\'you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Why, for the third one to be christened. How is it with you now?"\r\n\r\n"Nay," says Inger. "For that matter you might have saved yourself the\r\ntrouble."\r\n\r\n"Ho."\r\n\r\nOline falls to praising the children, so fine and big they\'ve grown;\r\nand Isak taking over more ground, and going to build again, by the\r\nlook of things--there\'s no end to things with them; a wonderful place,\r\nand hard to find its like. "And what is he going to build this time?"\r\n\r\n"Ask him yourself," says Inger. "I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Nay," says Oline. "\'Tis no business of mine. I just looked along to\r\nsee how things were with you here; it\'s a pleasure and delight for\r\nme to see. As for Goldenhorns, I\'ll not ask nor speak of her--she\'s\r\nfallen into proper ways, as any one can see."\r\n\r\nThey talk for a while companionably; Inger is no longer harsh. The\r\nclock on the wall strikes with its sweet little note. Oline looks up\r\nwith tears in her eyes; never in all her humble life did she hear such\r\na thing--\'tis like church and organ music, says Oline. Inger feels\r\nherself rich and generous-minded towards her poor relation, and says:\r\n"Come into the next room and see my loom."\r\n\r\nOline stays all day. She talks to Isak, and praises all his doings.\r\n"And I hear you\'ve bought up the land for miles on every side.\r\nCouldn\'t you have got it for nothing, then? There\'s none as I can see\r\nwould take it from you."\r\n\r\nIsak had been feeling the need of praise, and is the better for it\r\nnow. Feels a man again. "I\'m buying from the Government," says Isak.\r\n\r\n"Ay, Government. But they\'ve no call to be grasping in a deal, surely?\r\nWhat are you building now?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I don\'t know. Nothing much, anyway."\r\n\r\n"Ay, you\'re getting on; building and getting on you are. Painted doors\r\nto the house, and a clock on the wall--\'tis a new grand house you\'re\r\nbuilding, I suspect."\r\n\r\n"You, with your foolish talk ..." says Isak. But he is pleased all the\r\nsame, and says to Inger: "Couldn\'t you make a bit of a dish of nice\r\ncream custard for one that comes a-visiting?"\r\n\r\n"That I can\'t," says Inger, "for I\'ve churned all there was."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis no foolish talk," puts in Oline hurriedly; "I\'m but a simple\r\nwoman asking to know. And if it\'s not a new grand house, why, \'twill\r\nbe a new big barn, I dare say; and why not? With all these fields and\r\nmeadow lands, fine and full of growth; ay, and full of milk and honey,\r\nas the Bible says."\r\n\r\nIsak asks: "How\'s things looking your way--crops and the like?"\r\n\r\n"Why, \'tis there as it is till now. If only the Lord don\'t set fire\r\nto it all again this year, and burn up the lot--Heaven forgive me I\r\nshould say the word. \'Tis all in His hand and almighty power. But\r\nwe\'ve nothing our parts that\'s any way like this place of yours to\r\ncompare, and that\'s the solemn truth."\r\n\r\nInger asks after other relatives, her Uncle Sivert in particular. He\r\nis the great man of the family, and owns rich fisheries; \'tis almost\r\na wonder how he can find a way to spend all he has. The women talk of\r\nUncle Sivert, and Isak and his doings somehow drop out of sight; no\r\none asks any more about his building now, so at last he says:\r\n\r\n"Well, if you want to know, \'tis a bit of a barn with a\r\nthreshing-floor I\'m trying to get set up."\r\n\r\n"Just as I thought," says Oline. "Folk with real sound sense in their\r\nheads, they do that way. Fore-thought and back-thought and all as it\r\nshould be. There\'s not a pot nor pitcher in the place you haven\'t\r\nthought of. A threshing-floor, you said?"\r\n\r\nIsak is a child. Oline\'s flattering words go to his head, and he\r\nanswers something foolishly with fine words: "As to that new house of\r\nmine, there must be a threshing-floor in the same, necessarily. \'Tis\r\nmy intention so."\r\n\r\n"A threshing-floor?" says Oline, wagging her head.\r\n\r\n"And where\'s the sense of growing corn on the place if we\'ve nowhere\r\nto thresh it?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, \'tis as I say, not a thing as could be but you have it all there\r\nin your head."\r\n\r\nInger is suddenly out of humour again. The talk between the other two\r\nsomehow displeases her, and she breaks in:\r\n\r\n"Cream custard indeed! And where\'s the cream to come from? Fish it up\r\nin the river, maybe?"\r\n\r\nOline hastens to make peace. "Inger, Lord bless you, child, don\'t\r\nspeak of such a thing. Not a word of cream nor custard either--an old\r\ncreature like me that does but idle about from house to neighbour...!"\r\n\r\nIsak sits for a while, then up, and saying suddenly: "Here am I doing\r\nnothing middle of the day, and stones to fetch and carry for that wall\r\nof mine!"\r\n\r\n"Ay, a wall like that\'ll need a mighty lot of stone, to be sure."\r\n\r\n"Stone?" says Isak. "Tis like as if there\'d never be enough."\r\n\r\nWhen Isak is gone, the two womenfolk get on nicely together for a\r\nwhile; they sit for hours talking of this and that. In the evening,\r\nOline must go out and see how their live stock has grown: cows, a\r\nbull, two calves, and a swarm of sheep and goats. "I don\'t know where\r\nit\'ll ever end," says Oline, with her eyes turned heavenwards.\r\n\r\nAnd Oline stays the night.\r\n\r\nNext morning she goes off again. Once more she has a bundle of\r\nsomething with her. Isak is working in the quarry, and she goes\r\nanother way round, so that he shall not see.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later, Oline comes back again, steps into the house, and\r\nasks at once: "Where is Isak?"\r\n\r\nInger is washing up. Oline should have passed by the quarry where\r\nIsak was at work, and the children with him; Inger at once guesses\r\nsomething wrong.\r\n\r\n"Isak? What d\'you want with him?"\r\n\r\n"Want with him?--why, nothing. Only I didn\'t see him to say good-bye."\r\n\r\nSilence. Oline sits down on a bench without being asked, drops down as\r\nif her legs refuse to carry her. Her manner is intended to show that\r\nsomething serious is the matter; she is overcome.\r\n\r\nInger can control herself no longer. Her face is all terror and fury\r\nas she says:\r\n\r\n"I saw what you sent me by Os-Anders. Ay, \'twas a nice thing to send!"\r\n\r\n"Why ... what...?"\r\n\r\n"That hare."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" asks Oline in a strangely gentle voice.\r\n\r\n"Ah, don\'t deny it!" cries Inger, her eyes wild. "I\'ll break your face\r\nin with this ladle here--see that!"\r\n\r\nStruck her? Ay, she did so. Oline took the first blow without falling,\r\nand only cried out: "Mind what you\'re doing, woman! I know what I know\r\nabout you and your doings!" Inger strikes again, gets Oline down to\r\nthe floor, falls on her there, and thrusts her knees into her.\r\n\r\n"D\'you mean to murder me?" asks Oline. The terrible woman with the\r\nhare-lip was kneeling on her, a great strong creature armed with a\r\nhuge wooden ladle, heavy as a club. Oline was bruised already, and\r\nbleeding, but still sullenly refusing to cry out. "So you\'re trying to\r\nmurder me _too_!"\r\n\r\n"Ay, kill you," says Inger, striking again. "There! I\'ll see you dead\r\nbefore I\'ve done with you." She was certain of it now. Oline knew her\r\nsecret; nothing mattered now. "I\'ll spoil your beastly face."\r\n\r\n"Beastly face?" gasps Oline. "Huh! Look to your own. With the Lord His\r\nmark on it!"\r\n\r\nOline is hard, and will not give in; Inger is forced to give over\r\nthe blows that are exhausting her own strength. But she threatens\r\nstill--glares into the other\'s eyes and swears she has not finished\r\nwith her yet. "There\'s more to come, ay, more, more. Wait till I get a\r\nknife. I\'ll show you!"\r\n\r\nShe gets on her feet again, and moves as if to look for a knife, a\r\ntable knife. But now her fury is past its worst, and she falls back on\r\ncurses and abuse. Oline heaves herself up to the bench again, her face\r\nall blue and yellow, swollen and bleeding; she wipes the hair from\r\nher forehead, straightens her kerchief, and spits; her mouth too is\r\nbruised and swollen.\r\n\r\n"You devil!" she says.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been nosing about in the woods!" cries Inger. "That\'s what\r\nyou\'ve been doing. You\'ve found that little bit of a grave there.\r\nBetter if you\'d dug one for yourself the same time."\r\n\r\n"Ay, you wait," says Oline, her eyes glowing revengefully. "I\'ll say\r\nno more--but you wait--there\'ll be no fine two-roomed house for you,\r\nwith musical clocks and all."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t take it from me, anyway!"\r\n\r\n"Ay, you wait. You\'ll see what Oline can do."\r\n\r\nAnd so they keep on. Oline does not curse, and hardly raises her\r\nvoice; there is something almost gentle in her cold cruelty, but she\r\nis bitterly dangerous. "Where\'s that bundle? I left it in the woods.\r\nBut you shall have it back--I\'ll not own your wool."\r\n\r\n"Ho, you think I\'ve stolen it, maybe."\r\n\r\n"Ah, you know best what you\'ve done."\r\n\r\nSo back and forth again about the wool. Inger offers to show the very\r\nsheep it was cut from. Oline asks quietly, smoothly: "Ay, but who\r\nknows where you got the first sheep to start with?"\r\n\r\nInger names the place and people where her first sheep were out to\r\nkeep with their lambs. "And you mind and care and look to what you\'re\r\nsaying," says she threateningly. "Guard your mouth, or you\'ll be\r\nsorry."\r\n\r\n"Ha ha ha!" laughs Oline softly. Oline is never at a loss, never to be\r\nsilenced. "My mouth, eh? And what of your own, my dear?" She points to\r\nInger\'s hare-lip, calling her a ghastly sight for God and man.\r\n\r\nInger answers furiously, and Oline being fat, she calls her a lump of\r\nblubber--"a lump of dog\'s blubber like you. You sent me a hare--I\'ll\r\npay you for that."\r\n\r\n"Hare again?" says Oline. "If I\'d no more guilt in anything than I\r\nhave about that hare. What was it like?"\r\n\r\n"What was it like? Why, what\'s a hare always like?"\r\n\r\n"Like you. The very image."\r\n\r\n"Out with you--get out!" shrieks Inger.\r\n\r\n"\'Twas you sent Os-Anders with that hare. I\'ll have you punished; I\'ll\r\nhave you put in prison for that."\r\n\r\n"Prison--was it prison you said?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'re jealous and envious of all you see; you hate me for all\r\nthe good things I\'ve got," says Inger again. "You\'ve lain awake with\r\nenvy since I got Isak and all that\'s here. Heavens, woman, what have\r\nI ever done to you? Is it my fault that your children never got on in\r\nthe world, and turned out badly, every one of them? You can\'t bear the\r\nsight of mine, because they\'re fine and strong, and better named than\r\nyours. Is it my fault they\'re prettier flesh and blood than yours ever\r\nwere?"\r\n\r\nIf there was one thing could drive Oline to fury it was this. She had\r\nbeen a mother many times, and all she had was her children, such as\r\nthey were; she made much of them, and boasted of them, told of great\r\nthings they had never really done, and hid their faults.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that you\'re saying?" answered Oline. "Oh that you don\'t sink\r\nin your grave for shame! My children! They were a bright host of\r\nangels compared with yours. You dare to speak of my children? Seven\r\nblessed gifts of God they were from they were little, and all grown up\r\nnow every one. You dare to speak...."\r\n\r\n"What about Lise, that was sent to prison?" asks Inger.\r\n\r\n"For never a thing. She was as innocent as a flower," answers Oline.\r\n"And she\'s in Bergen now; lives in a town and wears a hat--but what\r\nabout you?"\r\n\r\n"What about Nils--what did they say of him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ll not lower myself.... But there\'s one of yours now lying\r\nburied out there in the woods--what did you do to it, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Now ...! One-two-three--out you go!" shrieks Inger again, and makes a\r\nrush at Oline.\r\n\r\nBut Oline does not move, does not even rise to her feet. Her stolid\r\nindifference paralyses Inger, who draws back, muttering: "Wait till I\r\nget that knife."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t trouble," says Oline. "I\'m going. But as for you, turning your\r\nown kin out of doors one-two-three.... Nay, I\'ll say no more."\r\n\r\n"Get out of this, that\'s all you need to do!"\r\n\r\nBut Oline is not gone yet. The two of them fall to again with words\r\nand abuse, a long bout of it again, and when the clock strikes half of\r\nthe hour, Oline laughs scornfully, making Inger wilder than ever. At\r\nlast both calm down a little, and Oline makes ready to go. "I\'ve a\r\nlong road before me," says she, "and it\'s late enough to be starting.\r\nIt wouldn\'t ha\' been amiss to have had a bite with me on the way...."\r\n\r\nInger makes no answer. She has come to her senses again now, and pours\r\nout water in a basin for Oline to wash. "There--if you want to tidy\r\nyourself," she says. Oline too thinks it as well to make herself as\r\ndecent as may be, but cannot see where the blood is, and washes the\r\nwrong places. Inger looks on for a while, and then points with her\r\nfinger.\r\n\r\n"There--wash there too, over your eye. No, not that, the other one;\r\ncan\'t you see where I\'m pointing?"\r\n\r\n"How can I see which one you\'re pointing at," answers Oline.\r\n\r\n"And there\'s more there, by your mouth. Are you afraid of water?--it\r\nwon\'t bite you!"\r\n\r\nIn the end, Inger washes the patient herself, and throws her a towel.\r\n\r\n"What I was going to say," says Oline, wiping herself, and quite\r\npeaceable now. "About Isak and the children--how will they get over\r\nthis?"\r\n\r\n"Does he know?" asks Inger.\r\n\r\n"Know? He came and saw it."\r\n\r\n"What did he say?"\r\n\r\n"What could he say? He was speechless, same as me."\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all your fault," wails Inger, beginning to cry.\r\n\r\n"My fault? I wish I may never have more to answer for!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll ask Os-Anders, anyhow, be sure of that."\r\n\r\n"Ay, do."\r\n\r\nThey talk it all over quietly, and Oline seems less revengeful now. An\r\nable politician, is Oline, and quick to find expedients; she speaks\r\nnow as if in sympathy--what a terrible thing it will be for Isak and\r\nthe children when it is found out!\r\n\r\n"Yes," says Inger, crying again. "I\'ve thought and thought of that\r\nnight and day." Oline thinks she might be able to help, and be a\r\nsaviour to them in distress. She could come and stay on the place to\r\nlook after things, while Inger is in prison.\r\n\r\nInger stops crying; stops suddenly as if to listen and take thought.\r\n"No, you don\'t care for the children."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t care for them, don\'t I? How could you say such a thing?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, I know...."\r\n\r\n"Why, if there\'s one thing in the world I do feel and care for, \'tis\r\nchildren."\r\n\r\n"Ay, for your own," says Inger. "But how would you be with mine? And\r\nwhen I think how you sent that hare for nothing else but to ruin me\r\naltogether--oh, you\'re no better than a heap of wickedness!"\r\n\r\n"Am I?" says Oline. "Is it me you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, \'tis you I mean," says Inger, crying; "you\'ve been a wicked\r\nwretch, you have, and I\'ll not trust you. And you\'d steal all the\r\nwool, too, if you did come. And all the cheeses that\'d go to your\r\npeople instead of mine...."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you wicked creature to think of such a thing!" answers Oline.\r\n\r\nInger cries, and wipes her eyes, saying a word or so between. Oline\r\ndoes not try to force her. If Inger does not care about the idea, \'tis\r\nall the same to her. She can go and stay with her son Nils, as she has\r\nalways done. But now that Inger is to be sent away to prison, it will\r\nbe a hard time for Isak and the innocent children; Oline could stay\r\non the place and give an eye to things. "You can think it over," says\r\nOline.\r\n\r\nInger has lost the day. She cries and shakes her head and looks down.\r\nShe goes out as if walking in her sleep, and makes up a parcel of food\r\nfor Oline to take with her. "\'Tis more than\'s worth your while," says\r\nOline.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t go all that way without a bite to eat," says Inger.\r\n\r\nWhen Oline has gone, Inger steals out, looks round, and listens. No,\r\nno sound from the quarry. She goes nearer, and hears the children\r\nplaying with little stones. Isak is sitting down, holding the crowbar\r\nbetween his knees, and resting on it like a staff. There he sits.\r\n\r\nInger steals away into the edge of the wood. There was a spot where\r\nshe had set a little cross in the ground; the cross is thrown down\r\nnow, and where it stood the turf has been lifted, and the ground\r\nturned over. She stoops down and pats the earth together again with\r\nher hands. And there she sits.\r\n\r\nShe had come out of curiosity, to see how far the little grave had\r\nbeen disturbed by Oline; she stays there now because the cattle have\r\nnot yet come in for the night. Sits there crying, shaking her head,\r\nand looking down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the days pass.\r\n\r\nA blessed time for the soil, with sun and showers of rain; the crops\r\nare looking well. The haymaking is nearly over now, and they have got\r\nin a grand lot of hay; almost more than they can find room for. Some\r\nis stowed away under overhanging rocks, in the stable, under the\r\nflooring of the house itself; the shed at the side is emptied of\r\neverything to make room for more hay. Inger herself works early and\r\nlate, a faithful helper and support. Isak takes advantage of every\r\nfall of rain to put in a spell of roofing on the new barn, and get the\r\nsouth wall at least fully done; once that is ready, they can stuff\r\nin as much hay as they please. The work is going forward; they will\r\nmanage, never fear!\r\n\r\nAnd their great sorrow and disaster--ay, it was there, the thing was\r\ndone, and what it brought must come. Good things mostly leave no\r\ntrace, but something always comes of evil. Isak took the matter\r\nsensibly from the first. He made no great words about it, but asked\r\nhis wife simply: "How did you come to do it?" Inger made no answer to\r\nthat. And a little after, he spoke again: "Strangled it--was that what\r\nyou did?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Inger.\r\n\r\n"You shouldn\'t have done that."\r\n\r\n"No," she agreed.\r\n\r\n"And I can\'t make out how you ever could bring yourself to do it."\r\n\r\n"She was all the same as myself," said Inger.\r\n\r\n"How d\'you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Her mouth."\r\n\r\nIsak thought over that for some time. "Ay, well," said he.\r\n\r\nAnd nothing more was said about it at the time; the days went on,\r\npeacefully as ever; there was all the mass of hay to be got in, and a\r\nrare heavy crop all round, so that by degrees the thing slipped into\r\nthe background of their minds. But it hung over them, and over the\r\nplace, none the less. They could not hope that Oline would keep the\r\nsecret; it was too much to expect. And even if Oline said nothing,\r\nothers would speak; dumb witnesses would find a tongue; the walls of\r\nthe house, the trees around the little grave in the wood. Os-Anders\r\nthe Lapp would throw out hints; Inger herself would betray it,\r\nsleeping or waking. They were prepared for the worst.\r\n\r\nIsak took the matter sensibly--what else was there to do? He knew now\r\nwhy Inger had always taken care to be left alone at every birth; to be\r\nalone with her fears of how the child might be, and face the danger\r\nwith no one by. Three times she had done the same thing. Isak shook\r\nhis head, touched with pity for her ill fate--poor Inger. He learned\r\nof the coming of the Lapp with the hare, and acquitted her. It led to\r\na great love between them, a wild love; they drew closer to each other\r\nin their peril. Inger was full of a desperate sweetness towards him,\r\nand the great heavy fellow, lumbering carrier of burdens, felt a greed\r\nand an endless desire for her in himself. And Inger, for all that she\r\nwore hide shoes like a Lapp, was no withered little creature as the\r\nLapland women are, but splendidly big. It was summer now, and she went\r\nabout barefooted, with her naked legs showing almost to the knee--Isak\r\ncould not keep his eyes from those bare legs.\r\n\r\nAll through the summer she went about singing bits of hymns, and she\r\ntaught Eleseus to say prayers; but there grew up in her an unchristian\r\nhate of all Lapps, and she spoke plainly enough to any that passed.\r\nSome one might have sent them again; like as not they had a hare in\r\ntheir bag as before; let them go on their way, and no more about it.\r\n\r\n"A hare? What hare?"\r\n\r\n"Ho, you haven\'t heard perhaps what Os-Anders he did that time?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t care who knows it--he came up here with a hare, when I\r\nwas with child."\r\n\r\n"Dear, and that was a dreadful thing! And what happened?"\r\n\r\n"Never you mind what happened, just get along with you, that\'s all.\r\nHere\'s a bite of food, and get along."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t happen to have an odd bit of leather anywhere, I could mend\r\nmy shoe with?"\r\n\r\n"No I But I\'ll give you a bit of stick if you don\'t get out!"\r\n\r\nNow a Lapp will beg as humbly as could be, but say no to him, and he\r\nturns bad, and threatens. A pair of Lapps with two children came past\r\nthe place; the children were sent up to the house to beg, and came\r\nback and said there was no one to be seen about the place. The four\r\nof them stood there a while talking in their own tongue, then the man\r\nwent up to see. He went inside, and stayed. Then his wife went up,\r\nand the children after; all of them stood inside the doorway, talking\r\nLapp. The man puts his head in the doorway and peeps through into the\r\nroom; no one there either. The clock strikes the hour, and the whole\r\nfamily stand listening in wonder.\r\n\r\nInger must have had some idea there were strangers about; she comes\r\nhurrying down the hillside, and seeing Lapps, strange Lapps into the\r\nbargain, asks them straight out what they are doing there. "What do\r\nyou want in here? Couldn\'t you see there was no one at home?"\r\n\r\n"H\'m ..." says the man.\r\n\r\n"Get out with you," says Inger again, "and go on your way."\r\n\r\nThe Lapps move out slowly, unwillingly. "We were just listening to\r\nthat clock of yours," says the man; "\'tis a wonder to hear, that it\r\nis."\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t a bit of bread to spare?" says his wife.\r\n\r\n"Where do you come from?" asks Inger.\r\n\r\n"From the water over beyond. We\'ve been walking all night."\r\n\r\n"And where are you going to now?"\r\n\r\n"Across the hills."\r\n\r\nInger makes up some food for them; when she comes out with it, the\r\nwoman starts begging again: a bit of stuff for a cap, a tuft of wool,\r\na stump of cheese--anything. Inger has no time to waste, Isak and the\r\nchildren are in the hayfield. "Be off with you now," she says.\r\n\r\nThe woman tries flattery. "We saw your place up here, and the\r\ncattle--a host of them, like the stars in the sky."\r\n\r\n"Ay, a wonder," says the man. "You haven\'t a pair of old shoes to give\r\naway to needy folk?"\r\n\r\nInger shuts the door of the house and goes back to her work on the\r\nhillside. The man called after her--she pretended not to hear, and\r\nwalked on unheeding. But she heard it well enough: "You don\'t want to\r\nbuy any hares, maybe?"\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking what he had said. The Lapp himself might have\r\nspoken innocently enough; some one had told him, perhaps. Or he might\r\nhave meant it ill. Be that as it may, Inger took it as a warning--a\r\nmessage of what was to come....\r\n\r\nThe days went on. The settlers were healthy folk; what was to come\r\nwould come; they went about their work and waited. They lived close to\r\neach other like beasts of the forest; they slept and ate; already the\r\nyear was so far advanced that they had tried the new potatoes, and\r\nfound them large and floury. The blow that was to fall--why did it not\r\ncome? It was late in August already, soon it would be September;\r\nwere they to be spared through the winter? They lived in a constant\r\nwatchfulness; every night they crept close together in their cave,\r\nthankful that the day had passed without event. And so the time went\r\non until one day in October, when the Lensmand came up with a man and\r\na bag. The Law stepped in through their doorway.\r\n\r\nThe investigation took some time. Inger was called up and examined\r\nprivately; she denied nothing. The grave in the wood was opened, and\r\nits contents removed, the body being sent for examination. The little\r\nbody--it was dressed in Eleseus\' christening robe, and a cap sewn over\r\nwith beads.\r\n\r\nIsak seemed to find speech again. "Ay," said he, "it\'s as bad as well\r\ncan be with us now. I\'ve said before--you ought never to have done\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"No," said Inger.\r\n\r\n"How did you do it?"\r\n\r\nInger made no answer.\r\n\r\n"That you could find it in your heart...."\r\n\r\n"She was just the same as myself to look at. And so I took and twisted\r\nher face round."\r\n\r\nIsak shook his head slowly.\r\n\r\n"And then she was dead," went on Inger, beginning to cry.\r\n\r\nIsak was silent for a while. "Well, well, \'tis too late to be crying\r\nover it now," said he.\r\n\r\n"She had brown hair," sobbed Inger, "there at the back of her\r\nhead...."\r\n\r\nAnd again no more was said.\r\n\r\nTime went on as before. Inger was not locked up; the law was merciful.\r\nLensmand Heyerdahl asked her questions just as he might have spoken to\r\nany one, and only said, "It\'s a great pity such things should happen\r\nat all." Inger asked who had informed against her, but the Lensmand\r\nanswered that it was no one in particular; many had spoken of the\r\nmatter, and he had heard of it from several quarters. Had she not\r\nherself said something about it to some Lapps?\r\n\r\nInger--ay, she had told some Lapps about Os-Anders, how he came and\r\nbrought a hare that summer, and gave her unborn child the hare-lip.\r\nAnd wasn\'t it Oline who had sent the hare?--The Lensmand knew nothing\r\nabout that. But in any case, he could not think of putting down such\r\nignorant superstition in his report.\r\n\r\n"But my mother saw a hare just before I was born," said Inger....\r\n\r\nThe barn was finished; a great big place it was, with hay-stalls on\r\nboth sides and a threshing-floor in the middle. The shed and the other\r\nmakeshift places were emptied now, and all the hay brought into the\r\nbarn; the corn was reaped, dried in stacks, and carted in. Inger\r\ntook up the carrots and turnips. All their crops were in now. And\r\neverything might have been well with them--they had all they needed.\r\nIsak had started on new ground again, before the frost came, to make a\r\nbigger cornfield; Isak was a tiller of the soil. But in November Inger\r\nsaid one day, "She would have been six months old now, and known us\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis no good talking of that now," said Isak.\r\n\r\nWhen the winter came, Isak threshed his corn on the new\r\nthreshing-floor, and Inger helped him often, with an arm as quick to\r\nthe work as his own, while the children played in the haystalls at the\r\nside. It was fine plump grain. Early in the new year the roads were\r\ngood, and Isak started carting down his loads of wood to the village;\r\nhe had his regular customers now, and the summer-dried wood fetched a\r\ngood price. One day he and Inger agreed that they should take the fine\r\nbull-calf from Goldenhorns and drive it down to Fru Geissler, with\r\na cheese into the bargain. She was delighted, and asked how much it\r\ncost.\r\n\r\n"Nothing," said Isak. "The Lensmand paid for it before."\r\n\r\n"Heaven bless him, and did he?" said Fru Geissler, touched at the\r\nthought. She sent things up for Eleseus and Sivert in return--cakes\r\nand picture-books and toys. When Isak came back and Inger saw the\r\nthings, she turned away and cried.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" asked Isak.\r\n\r\n"Nothing," answered Inger. "Only--she\'d have been just a year now, and\r\nable to see it all."\r\n\r\n"Ay, but you know how it was with her," said Isak, for comfort\'s sake.\r\n"And after all, it may be we\'ll get off easier than we thought. I\'ve\r\nfound out where Geissler is now."\r\n\r\nInger looked up. "But how\'s that going to help us?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know...."\r\n\r\nThen Isak carried his corn to the mill and had it ground, and brought\r\nback flour. Then he turned woodman again, cutting the wood to be ready\r\nfor next winter. His life was spent in this work and that, according\r\nto the season; from the fields to the woods, and back to the fields\r\nagain. He had worked on the place for six years now, and Inger five;\r\nall might have been well, if it were only allowed to last. But it was\r\nnot. Inger worked at her loom and tended the animals; also, she was\r\noften to be heard singing hymns, but it was a pitiful singing; she was\r\nlike a bell without a tongue.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the roads were passable, she was sent for down to the\r\nvillage to be examined. Isak had to stay behind. And being there all\r\nalone, it came into his mind to go across to Sweden and find out\r\nGeissler; the former Lensmand had been kind to them, and might perhaps\r\nstill lend a helping hand some way to the folks at Sellanraa. But\r\nwhen Inger returned, she had asked about things herself, and learned\r\nsomething of what her sentence was likely to be. Strictly speaking,\r\nit was imprisonment for life, Paragraph I. But ... After all, she had\r\nstood up in the court itself and simply confessed. The two witnesses\r\nfrom the village had looked pityingly at her, and the judge had put\r\nhis questions kindly; but for all that, she was no match for the\r\nbright intellects of the law. Lawyers are great men to simple folk;\r\nthey can quote paragraph this and section that; they have learned such\r\nthings by rote, ready to bring out at any moment. Oh, they are great\r\nmen indeed. And apart from all this knowledge, they are not always\r\ndevoid of sense; sometimes even not altogether heartless. Inger had no\r\ncause to complain of the court; she made no mention of the hare, but\r\nwhen she tearfully explained that she could not be so cruel to her\r\npoor deformed child as to let it live, the magistrate nodded, quietly\r\nand seriously.\r\n\r\n"But," said he, "think of yourself; you have a hare-lip, and it has\r\nnot spoilt your life."\r\n\r\n"No, thanks be to God," was all she said. She could not tell them of\r\nall she had suffered in secret as a child, as a young girl.\r\n\r\nBut the magistrate must have understood something of what it meant; he\r\nhimself had a club-foot, and could not dance. "As to the sentence," he\r\nsaid, "I hardly know. Really, it should be imprisonment for life, but\r\n... I can\'t say, perhaps we might get it commuted, second or third\r\ndegree, fifteen to twelve years, or twelve to nine. There\'s a\r\ncommission sitting to reform the criminal code, make it more humane,\r\nbut the final decision won\'t be ready yet. Anyhow, we must hope for\r\nthe best," said he.\r\n\r\nInger came back in a state of dull resignation; they had not found it\r\nnecessary to keep her in confinement meantime. Two months passed; then\r\none evening, when Isak came back from fishing, the Lensmand and his\r\nnew assistant had been to Sellanraa.\r\n\r\nInger was cheerful, and welcomed her husband kindly, praising his\r\ncatch, though it was little he had brought home.\r\n\r\n"What I was going to say--has any one been here?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Any one been? Why, who should there be?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s fresh footmarks outside. Men with boots on."\r\n\r\n"Why--there\'s been no one but the Lensmand and one other."\r\n\r\n"What did they want?"\r\n\r\n"You know that without asking."\r\n\r\n"Did they come to fetch you?"\r\n\r\n"Fetch me? No, \'twas only about the sentence. The Lord is kind, \'tis\r\nnot so bad as I feared."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Isak eagerly. "Not so long, maybe?"\r\n\r\n"No. Only a few years."\r\n\r\n"How many years?"\r\n\r\n"Why, you might think it a lot, maybe. But I\'m thankful to God all the\r\nsame."\r\n\r\nInger did not say how long it would be. Later that evening Isak asked\r\nwhen they would be coming to fetch her away, but this she could not or\r\nwould not tell. She had grown thoughtful again, and talked of what was\r\nto come; how they would manage she could not think--but she supposed\r\nthey would have to get Oline to come. And Isak had no better plan to\r\noffer.\r\n\r\nWhat had become of Oline, by the way? She had not been up this year as\r\nshe used to do. Was she going to stay away for ever, now that she had\r\nupset everything for them? The working season passed, but Oline did\r\nnot come--did she expect them to go and fetch her? She would come\r\nloitering up of herself, no doubt, the great lump of blubber, the\r\nmonster.\r\n\r\nAnd at last one day she did. Extraordinary person--it was as nothing\r\nwhatever had occurred to make ill-feeling between them; she was even\r\nknitting a pair of new stockings for Eleseus, she said.\r\n\r\n"Just came up to see how you were getting on over here," said she.\r\nAnd it turned out that she had brought her clothes and things up in a\r\nsack, and left in the woods close by, ready to stay.\r\n\r\nThat evening Inger took her husband aside and said: "Didn\'t you say\r\nsomething about seeking out Geissler? \'Tis in the slack time now."\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Isak. "Now that Oline is come, I can go off tomorrow\r\nmorning, first thing."\r\n\r\nInger was grateful, and thanked him. "And take your money with you,"\r\nshe said--"all you have in the place."\r\n\r\n"Why, can\'t you keep the money here?"\r\n\r\n"No," said she.\r\n\r\nInger made up a big parcel of food at once, and Isak woke while it was\r\nyet night, and got ready to start. Inger went out on the door-slab to\r\nsee him off; she did not cry or complain, but only said:\r\n\r\n"They may be coming for me now any day."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know when?"\r\n\r\n"No, I can\'t say. And I don\'t suppose it will be just yet, but\r\nanyhow.... If only you could get hold of Geissler, perhaps he might be\r\nable to say something."\r\n\r\nWhat could Geissler do to help them now? Nothing. But Isak went.\r\n\r\nInger--oh, she knew, no doubt, more than she had been willing to say.\r\nIt might be, too, that she herself had sent for Oline. When Isak came\r\nfrom Sweden, Inger was gone and Oline was there with the two children.\r\n\r\nIt was dark news for a homecoming. Isak\'s voice was louder than usual\r\nas he asked: "Is she gone?"\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Oline.\r\n\r\n"What day was it?"\r\n\r\n"The day after you left." And Isak knew now that Inger had got him out\r\nof the way on purpose--that was why she had persuaded him to take the\r\nmoney with him. Oh, but she might have kept a little for herself, for\r\nthat long journey!\r\n\r\nBut the children could think of nothing else but the little pig Isak\r\nhad brought with him. It was all he had for his trouble; the address\r\nhe had was out of date, and Geissler was no longer in Sweden, but had\r\nreturned to Norway and was now in Trondhjem. As for the pig, Isak\r\nhad carried it in his arms all the way, feeding it with milk from a\r\nbottle, and sleeping with it on his breast among the hills. He had\r\nbeen looking forward to Inger\'s delight when she saw it; now, Eleseus\r\nand Sivert played with it, and it was a joy to them. And Isak,\r\nwatching them, forgot his trouble for the moment. Moreover, Oline had\r\na message from the Lensmand; the State had at last given its decision\r\nin the matter of the land at Sellanraa. Isak had only to go down to\r\nthe office and pay the amount. This was good news, and served to keep\r\nhim from the worst depth of despair. Tired and worn out as he was,\r\nhe packed up some food in a bag and set off for the village at once.\r\nMaybe he had some little hope of seeing Inger once again before she\r\nleft there.\r\n\r\nBut he was disappointed. Inger was gone--for eight years. Isak felt\r\nhimself in a mist of darkness and emptiness; heard only a word here\r\nand there of all the Lensmand said--a pity such things should happen\r\n... hoped it might be a lesson to her ... reform and be a better woman\r\nafter, and not kill her children any more!\r\n\r\nLensmand Heyerdahl had married the year before. His wife had no\r\nintention of ever being a mother--no children for her, thank you! And\r\nshe had none.\r\n\r\n"And now," said the Lensmand, "this business about Sellanraa. At\r\nlast I am in a position to settle it definitely. The Department is\r\ngraciously pleased to approve the sale of the land, more or less\r\naccording to the terms I suggested."\r\n\r\n"H\'m," said Isak.\r\n\r\n"It has been a lengthy business, but I have the satisfaction of\r\nknowing that my endeavours have not been altogether fruitless. The\r\nterms I proposed have been agreed to almost without exception."\r\n\r\n"Without exception," said Isak, and nodded.\r\n\r\n"Here are the title-deeds. You can have the transfer registered at the\r\nfirst session."\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Isak. "And how much is there to pay?"\r\n\r\n"Ten _Daler_ a year. The Department has made a slight alteration\r\nhere--ten _Daler_ per annum instead of five. You have no objection to\r\nthat, I presume?"\r\n\r\n"As long as I can manage to pay ..." said Isak.\r\n\r\n"And for ten years." Isak looked up, half frightened.\r\n\r\n"Those are the terms--the Department insists. Even then, it\'s no price\r\nreally for all that land, cleared and cultivated as it is now."\r\n\r\nIsak had the ten _Daler_ for that year--it was the money he had got\r\nfor his loads of wood, and for the cheeses Inger had laid by. He paid\r\nthe amount, and had still a small sum left.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a lucky thing for you the Department didn\'t get to hear about\r\nyour wife," said the Lensmand. "Or they might have sold to some one\r\nelse."\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Isak. He asked about Inger. "Is it true that she\'s gone\r\naway for eight years?"\r\n\r\n"That is so. And can\'t be altered--the law must take its course. As\r\na matter of fact, the sentence is extraordinarily light. There\'s one\r\nthing you must do now--that is, to set up clear boundaries between\r\nyour land and the State\'s. A straight, direct line, following the\r\nmarks I set up on the spot, and entered in my register at the time.\r\nThe timber cleared from the boundary line becomes your property. I\r\nwill come up some time and have a look at what you have done."\r\n\r\nIsak trudged back to his home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTime flies? Ay, when a man is growing old. Isak was not old, he had\r\nnot lost his vigour; the years seemed long to him. He worked on his\r\nland, and let his iron beard grow as it would.\r\n\r\nNow and again the monotony of the wilderness was broken by the sight\r\nof a passing Lapp, or by something happening to one of the animals on\r\nthe place, then all would be as before. Once there came a number of\r\nmen at once; they rested at Sellanraa, and had some food and a dish of\r\nmilk; they asked Isak and Oline about the path across the hills;\r\nthey were marking out the telegraph line, they said. And once came\r\nGeissler--Geissler himself, and no other. There he came, free and\r\neasy as ever, walking up from the village, two men with him, carrying\r\nmining tools, pick and spade.\r\n\r\nOh, that Geissler! Unchanged, the same as ever; meeting and greeting\r\nas if nothing had happened, talked to the children, went into the\r\nhouse and came out again, looked over the ground, opened the doors of\r\ncowshed and hayloft and looked in. "Excellent!" said he. "Isak, have\r\nyou still got those bits of stone?"\r\n\r\n"Bits of stone?" said Isak, wondering.\r\n\r\n"Little heavy lumps of stone I saw the boy playing with when I was\r\nhere once before."\r\n\r\nThe stones were out in the larder, serving as weights for so many\r\nmouse-traps; Isak brought them in. Geissler and the two men examined\r\nthem, talking together, tapped them here and there, weighed them in\r\nthe hand. "Copper," they said.\r\n\r\n"Could you go up with us and show where you found them?" asked\r\nGeissler.\r\n\r\nThey all went up together; it was not far to the place where Isak had\r\nfound the stones, but they stayed up in the hills for a couple of\r\ndays, looking for veins of metal, and firing charges here and there.\r\nThey came down to Sellanraa with two bags filled with heavy lumps of\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nIsak had meanwhile had a talk with Geissler, and told him everything\r\nas to his own position: about the purchase of the land, which had come\r\nto a hundred _Daler_ instead of fifty.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a trifle," said Geissler easily. "You\'ve thousands, like as\r\nnot, on your part of the hills."\r\n\r\n"Ho!" said Isak.\r\n\r\n"But you\'d better get those title-deeds entered in the register as\r\nsoon as ever you can."\r\n\r\n"Ay."\r\n\r\n"Then the State can\'t come any nonsense about it after, you\r\nunderstand."\r\n\r\nIsak understood. "\'Tis worst about Inger," he said.\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Geissler, and remained thoughtful longer than was usual\r\nwith him. "Might get the case brought up again. Set out the whole\r\nthing properly; very likely get the sentence reduced a bit. Or we\r\ncould put in an application for a pardon, and that would probably come\r\nto the same thing in the end."\r\n\r\n"Why, if as that could be done...."\r\n\r\n"But it wouldn\'t do to try for a pardon at once. Have to wait a bit.\r\nWhat was I going to say ... you\'ve been taking things down to my\r\nwife--meat and cheese and things--what?"\r\n\r\n"Why, as to that, Lensmand paid for all that before."\r\n\r\n"Did I, though?"\r\n\r\n"And helped us kindly in many a way."\r\n\r\n"Not a bit of it," said Geissler shortly. "Here--take this." And he\r\ntook out some _Daler_ notes.\r\n\r\nGeissler was not the man to take things for nothing, that was plain.\r\nAnd he seemed to have plenty of money about him, from the way his\r\npocket bulged. Heaven only knew if he really had money or not.\r\n\r\n"But she writes all\'s well and getting on," said Isak, coming back to\r\nhis one thought.\r\n\r\n"What?--Oh, your wife!"\r\n\r\n"Ay. And since the girl was born--she\'s had a girl child, born while\r\nshe was there. A fine little one."\r\n\r\n"Excellent!"\r\n\r\n"Ay, and now they\'re all as kind as can be, and help her every way,\r\nshe says."\r\n\r\n"Look here," said Geissler, "I\'m going to send these bits of stone\r\nin to some mining experts, and find out what\'s in them. If there\'s a\r\ndecent percentage of copper, you\'ll be a rich man."\r\n\r\n"H\'m," said Isak. "And how long do you think before we could apply for\r\na pardon?"\r\n\r\n"Well, not so very long, perhaps, I\'ll write the thing for you. I\'ll\r\nbe back here again soon. What was it you said--your wife has had a\r\nchild since she left here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Then they took her away while she was expecting it. That\'s a thing\r\nthey\'ve no right to do."\r\n\r\n"Ho!"\r\n\r\n"Anyhow, it\'s one more reason for letting her out earlier."\r\n\r\n"Ay, if that could be ..." said Isak gratefully.\r\n\r\nIsak knew nothing of the many lengthy writings backward and forward\r\nbetween the different authorities concerning the woman who was\r\nexpecting a child. The local authorities had let her go free while the\r\nmatter was pending, for two reasons: in the first place, they had no\r\nlock-up in the village where they could keep her, and, in the second\r\nplace, they wished to be as lenient as possible. The consequence was\r\nsomething they could not have foreseen. Later, when they had sent\r\nto fetch her away, no one had inquired about her condition, and she\r\nherself had said nothing of it. Possibly she had concealed the matter\r\non purpose, in order to have a child with her during the years of\r\nimprisonment; if she behaved well, she would no doubt be allowed to\r\nsee it now and again. Or perhaps she had been merely indifferent, and\r\nhad gone off carelessly, despite her state....\r\n\r\nIsak worked and toiled, dug ditches and broke new ground, set up his\r\nboundary lines between his land and the State\'s, and gained another\r\nseason\'s stock of timber. But now that Inger was no longer there to\r\nwonder at his doings, he worked more from habit than for any joy in\r\nwhat he did. And he had let two sessions pass without having his\r\ntitle-deeds registered, caring little about it; at last, that autumn,\r\nhe had pulled himself together and got it done. Things were not as\r\nthey should be with Isak now. Quiet and patient as ever--yes, but now\r\nit was because he did not care. He got out hides because it had to be\r\ndone--goatskins and calfskins--steeped them in the river, laid them\r\nin bark, and tanned them after a fashion ready for shoes. In the\r\nwinter--at the very first threshing--he set aside his seed corn for\r\nthe next spring, in order to have it done; best to have things done\r\nand done with; he was a methodical man. But it was a grey and lonely\r\nlife; eyah, _Herregud_! a man without a wife again, and all the\r\nrest....\r\n\r\nWhat pleasure was there now in sitting at home Sundays, cleanly\r\nwashed, with a neat red shirt on, when there was no one to be clean\r\nand neat for! Sundays were the longest days of all, days when he was\r\nforced to idleness and weary thoughts; nothing to do but wander about\r\nover the place, counting up all that should have been done. He always\r\ntook the children with him, always carried one on his arm. It was\r\na distraction to hear their chatter, and answer their questions of\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nHe kept old Oline because there was no one else he could get. And\r\nOline was, after all, of use in a way. Carding and spinning, knitting\r\nstockings and mittens, and making cheese--she could do all these\r\nthings, but she lacked Inger\'s happy touch, and had no heart in her\r\nwork; nothing of all she handled was her own. There was a thing Isak\r\nhad bought once at the village store, a china pot with a dog\'s head on\r\nthe lid. It was a sort of tobacco box, really, and stood on a shelf.\r\nOline took off the lid and dropped it on the floor. Inger had left\r\nbehind some cuttings of fuchsia, under glass. Oline took the glass off\r\nand, putting it back, pressed it down hard and maliciously; next day,\r\nall the cuttings were dead. It was not so easy for Isak to bear with\r\nsuch things; he looked displeased, and showed it, and, as there was\r\nnothing swanlike and gentle about Isak, it may well be that he showed\r\nit plainly. Oline cared little for looks; soft-spoken as ever, she\r\nonly said: "Now, could I help it?"\r\n\r\n"That I can\'t say," answered Isak. "But you might have left the things\r\nalone."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll not touch her flowers again," said Oline. But the flowers were\r\nalready dead.\r\n\r\nAgain, how could it be that the Lapps came up to Sellanraa so\r\nfrequently of late? Os-Anders, for instance, had no business there at\r\nall, he should have passed on his way. Twice in one summer he came\r\nacross the hills, and Os-Anders, it should be remembered, had no\r\nreindeer to look to, but lived by begging and quartering himself on\r\nother Lapps. As soon as he came up to the place, Oline left her work\r\nand fell to chatting with him about people in the village, and, when\r\nhe left, his sack was heavy with no end of things. Isak put up with it\r\nfor two years, saying nothing.\r\n\r\nThen Oline wanted new shoes again, and he could be silent no longer.\r\nIt was in the autumn, and Oline wore shoes every day, instead of going\r\nin wooden pattens or rough hide.\r\n\r\n"Looks like being fine today," said Isak. "H\'m." That was how he\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Oline.\r\n\r\n"Those cheeses, Eleseus," went on Isak again, "wasn\'t it ten you\r\ncounted on the shelf this morning?"\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Eleseus.\r\n\r\n"Well, there\'s but nine there now."\r\n\r\nEleseus counted again, and thought for a moment inside his little\r\nhead; then he said: "Yes, but then Os-Anders had one to take away;\r\nthat makes ten."\r\n\r\nThere was silence for quite a while after that. Then little Sivert\r\nmust try to count as well, and says after his brother: "That makes\r\nten."\r\n\r\nSilence again. At last Oline felt she must say something.\r\n\r\n"Ay, I did give him a tiny one, that\'s true. I didn\'t think that could\r\ndo any harm. But they children, they\'re no sooner able to talk than\r\nthey show what\'s in them. And who they take after\'s more than I can\r\nthink or guess. For \'tis not your way, Isak, that I do know."\r\n\r\nThe hint was too plain to pass unchecked. "The children are well\r\nenough," said Isak shortly. "But I\'d like to know what good Os-Anders\r\nhas ever done to me and mine."\r\n\r\n"What good?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, that\'s what I said."\r\n\r\n"What good Os-Anders ...?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, since I\'m to give him cheeses in return."\r\n\r\nOline has had time to think, and has her answer ready now.\r\n\r\n"Well, now, I wouldn\'t have thought it of you, Isak, that I wouldn\'t.\r\nWas it me, pray, that first began with Os-Anders? I wish I may never\r\nmove alive from this spot if I ever so much as spoke his name."\r\n\r\nBrilliant success for Oline. Isak has to give in, as he has done many\r\na time before.\r\n\r\nBut Oline had more to say. "And if you mean I\'m to go here clean\r\nbarefoot, with the winter coming on and all, and never own the like\r\nof a pair of shoes, why, you\'ll please to say so. I said a word of it\r\nthree and four weeks gone, that I needed shoes, but never sign of a\r\nshoe to this day, and here I am."\r\n\r\nSaid Isak: "What\'s wrong with your pattens, then, that you can\'t use\r\nthem?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong with them?" repeats Oline, all unprepared.\r\n\r\n"Ay, that\'s what I\'d like to know."\r\n\r\n"With my pattens?"\r\n\r\n"Ay."\r\n\r\n"Well ... and me carding and spinning, and tending cattle and sheep\r\nand all, looking after children here--have you nothing to say to that?\r\nI\'d like to know; that wife of yours that\'s in prison for her deeds,\r\ndid you let her go barefoot in the snow?"\r\n\r\n"She wore her pattens," said Isak. "And for going to church and\r\nvisiting and the like, why, rough hide was good enough for her."\r\n\r\n"Ay, and all the finer for it, no doubt."\r\n\r\n"Ay, that she was. And when she did wear her hide shoes in summer, she\r\ndid but stuff a wisp of grass in them, and never no more. But you--you\r\nmust wear stockings in your shoes all the year round."\r\n\r\nSaid Oline: "As for that, I\'ll wear out my pattens in time, no doubt.\r\nI\'d no thought there was any such haste to wear out good pattens all\r\nat once." She spake softly and gently, but with half-closed eyes, the\r\nsame sly Oline as ever. "And as for Inger," said she, "the changeling,\r\nas we called her, she went about with children of mine and learned\r\nboth this and that, for years she did. And this is what we get for\r\nit. Because I\'ve a daughter that lives in Bergen and wears a hat,\r\nI suppose that\'s what Inger must be gone away south for; gone to\r\nTrondhjem to buy a hat, he he!"\r\n\r\nIsak got up to leave the room. But Oline had opened her heart now,\r\nunlocked the store of blackness within; ay, she gave out rays of\r\ndarkness, did Oline. Thank Heaven, none of her children had their\r\nfaces slit like a fire-breathing dragon, so to speak; but they were\r\nnone the worse for that, maybe. No, \'twasn\'t every one was so quick\r\nand handy at getting rid of the young they bore--strangling them in a\r\ntwinkling....\r\n\r\n"Mind what you\'re saying," shouted Isak. And to make his meaning\r\nperfectly clear, he added: "You cursed old hag!"\r\n\r\nBut Oline was not going to mind what she was saying; not in the least,\r\nhe he! She turned up her eyes to heaven and hinted that a hare-lip\r\nmight be this or that, but some folk seemed to carry it too far, he\r\nhe!\r\n\r\nIsak may well have been glad to get safely out of the house at last.\r\nAnd what could he do but get Oline the shoes? A tiller of earth in the\r\nwilds; no longer even something of a god, that he could say to his\r\nservant, "Go!" He was helpless without Oline; whatever she did or\r\nsaid, she had nothing to fear, and she knew it.\r\n\r\nThe nights are colder now, with a full moon; the marshlands harden\r\ntill they can almost bear, but thawing again when the sun comes out,\r\nto an impassable swamp once more. Isak goes down to the village one\r\ncold night, to order shoes for Oline. He takes a couple of cheeses\r\nwith him, for Fru Geissler.\r\n\r\nHalf-way down to the village a new settler has appeared. A well-to-do\r\nman, no doubt, since he had called in folk from the village to build\r\nhis house, and hired men to plough up a patch of sandy moorland for\r\npotatoes; he himself did little or nothing. The new man was Brede\r\nOlsen, Lensmand\'s assistant, a man to go to when the doctor had to be\r\nfetched, or a pig to be killed. He was not yet thirty, but had four\r\nchildren to look after, not to speak of his wife, who was as good as\r\na child herself. Oh, Brede was not so well off, perhaps, after all;\r\n\'twas no great money he could earn running hither and thither on all\r\nodd businesses, and collecting taxes from people that would not pay.\r\nSo now he was trying a new venture on the soil. He had raised a loan\r\nat the bank to start house in the wilds. Breidablik, he called the\r\nplace; and it was Lensmand Heyerdahl\'s lady that had found that\r\nsplendid name.\r\n\r\nIsak hurries past the house, not wasting time on looking in, but he\r\ncan see through the window that all the children are up already, early\r\nas it is. Isak has no time to lose, if he is to be back as far as this\r\non the homeward journey next night, while the roads are hard. A man\r\nliving in the wilds has much to think of, to reckon out and fit in as\r\nbest can be. It is not the busiest time for him just now, but he is\r\nanxious about the children, left all alone with Oline.\r\n\r\nHe thinks, as he walks, of the first time he had come that way. Time\r\nhas passed, the two last years had been long; there had been much that\r\nwas good at Sellanraa, and a deal that was not--eyah, _Herregud_! And\r\nnow here was another man clearing ground in the wilds. Isak knew the\r\nplace well; it was one of the kindlier spots he had noted himself on\r\nhis way up, but he had gone on farther. It was nearer the village,\r\ncertainly, but the timber was not so good; the ground was less hilly,\r\nbut a poorer soil; easy to work on the surface, but hard to deal with\r\nfarther down. That fellow Brede would find it took more than a mere\r\nturning over of the soil to made a field that would bear. And why\r\nhadn\'t he built out a shed from the end of the hayloft for carts and\r\nimplements? Isak noticed that a cart had been left standing out in the\r\nyard, uncovered, in the open.\r\n\r\nHe got through his business with the shoemaker, and, Fru Geissler\r\nhaving left the place, he sold his cheeses to the man at the store. In\r\nthe evening, he starts out for home. The frost is getting harder now,\r\nand it is good, firm going, but Isak trudges heavily for all that. Who\r\ncould say when Geissler would be back, now that his wife had gone;\r\nmaybe he would not be coming at all? Inger was far away, and time was\r\ngetting on....\r\n\r\nHe does not look in at Brede\'s on the way back; on the contrary, he\r\ngoes a long way round, keeping away from the place. He does not care\r\nto stop and talk to folk, only trudge on. Brede\'s cart is still out in\r\nthe open--does he mean to leave it there? Well, \'tis his own affair.\r\nIsak himself had a cart of his own now, and a shed to house it, but\r\nnone the happier for that. His home is but half a thing; it had been a\r\nhome once, but now only half a thing.\r\n\r\nIt is full day by the time he gets within sight of his own place up on\r\nthe hillside, and it cheers him somewhat, weary and exhausted as he is\r\nafter forty-eight hours on the road. The house and buildings, there\r\nthey stand, smoke curling up from the chimney; both the little ones\r\nare out, and come down to meet him as he appears. He goes into the\r\nhouse, and finds a couple of Lapps sitting down. Oline starts up in\r\nsurprise: "What, you back already!" She is making coffee on the stove.\r\nCoffee? _Coffee_!\r\n\r\nIsak has noticed the same thing before. When Os-Anders or any of the\r\nother Lapps have been there, Oline makes coffee in Inger\'s little pot\r\nfor a long time after. She does it while Isak is out in the woods or\r\nin the fields, and when he comes in unexpectedly and sees it, she says\r\nnothing. But he knows that he is the poorer by a cheese or a bundle of\r\nwool each time. And it is to his credit that he does not pick up Oline\r\nin his fingers and crush her to pieces for her meanness. Altogether,\r\nIsak is trying hard indeed to make himself a better man, better and\r\nbetter, whatever may be his idea, whether it be for the sake of peace\r\nin the house, or in some hope that the Lord may give him back his\r\nInger the sooner. He is something given to superstition and a\r\npondering upon things; even his rustic wariness is innocent in its\r\nway. Early that autumn he found the turf on the roof of the stable was\r\nbeginning to slip down inside. Isak chewed at his beard for a while,\r\nthen, smiling like a man who understands a jest, he laid some poles\r\nacross to keep it up. Not a bitter word did he say. And another thing:\r\nthe shed where he kept his store of provisions was simply built on\r\nhigh stone feet at the corners, with nothing between. After a while,\r\nlittle birds began to find their way in through the big gaps in the\r\nwall, and stayed fluttering about inside, unable to get out. Oline\r\ncomplained that they picked at the food and spoiled the meat, and made\r\na nasty mess about the place. Isak said: "Ay, \'tis a pity small birds\r\nshould come in and not be able to get out again." And in the thick of\r\na busy season he turned stonemason and filled up the gaps in the wall.\r\n\r\nHeaven knows what was in his mind that he took things so; whether\r\nmaybe he fancied Inger might be given back to him the sooner for his\r\ngentleness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe years pass by.\r\n\r\nOnce more there came visitors to Sellanraa; an engineer, with a\r\nforeman and a couple of workmen, marking out telegraph lines again\r\nover the hills. By the route they were taking now, the line would be\r\ncarried a little above the house, and a straight road cut through the\r\nforest. No harm in that. It would make the place less desolate, a\r\nglimpse of the world would make it brighter.\r\n\r\n"This place," said, the engineer, "will be just about midway between\r\ntwo lines through the valleys on either side. They\'ll very likely ask\r\nyou to take on the job of linesman for both."\r\n\r\n"Ho!" said Isak.\r\n\r\n"It will be twenty-five _Daler_ a year in your pocket."\r\n\r\n"H\'m," said Isak. "And what am I to do for that?"\r\n\r\n"Keep the line in repair, mend the wires when necessary, clear away\r\nforest growth on the route as it comes up. They\'ll set up a little\r\nmachine thing in the house here, to hang on the wall, that\'ll tell you\r\nwhen you\'re wanted. And when it does, you must leave whatever you\'re\r\ndoing and go."\r\n\r\nIsak thought it over. "I could do it all right in winter," he said.\r\n\r\n"That\'s no good. It would have to be for the whole year, summer and\r\nwinter alike."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t be done," said Isak. "Spring and summer and autumn I\'ve my work\r\non the land, and no time for other things."\r\n\r\nThe engineer looked at him for quite a while, and then put an\r\nastonishing question, as follows: "Can you make more money that way?"\r\n\r\n"Make more money?" said Isak.\r\n\r\n"Can you earn more money in a day by working on the land than you\r\ncould by working for us?"\r\n\r\n"Why, as to that, I can\'t say," answered Isak. "It\'s just this way,\r\nyou see--\'tis the land I\'m here for. I\'ve many souls and more beasts\r\nto keep alive--and \'tis the land that keeps us. \'Tis our living."\r\n\r\n"If you won\'t, I can find some one else," said the engineer.\r\n\r\nBut Isak only seemed rather relieved at the threat. He did not like\r\nto disoblige the great man, and tried to explain. "\'Tis this way," he\r\nsaid, "I\'ve a horse and five cows, besides the bull. I\'ve twenty sheep\r\nand sixteen goats. The beasts, they give us food and wool and hide; we\r\nmust give them food."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, of course," said the other shortly.\r\n\r\n"Well, and so I say, how am I to feed them when I\'ve to run away all\r\ntimes in the busy season, to work on the telegraph line?"\r\n\r\n"Say no more about it," said the engineer. "I\'ll get the man down\r\nbelow you, Brede Olsen; he\'ll be glad to take it." He turned to his\r\nmen with a brief word: "Now, lads, we\'ll be getting on,"\r\n\r\nNow Oline had heard from the way Isak spoke that he was stiff-necked\r\nand unreasonable in his mind, and she would make the most of it.\r\n\r\n"What was that you said, Isak? Sixteen goats? There\'s no more than\r\nfifteen," said she.\r\n\r\nIsak looked at her, and Oline looked at him again, straight in the\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"Not sixteen goats?" said he.\r\n\r\n"No," said she, looking helplessly towards the strangers, as if to say\r\nhow unreasonable he was.\r\n\r\n"Ho!" said Isak softly. He drew a tuft of his beard between his teeth\r\nand stood chewing it.\r\n\r\nThe engineer and his men went on their way.\r\n\r\nNow, if Isak had wanted to show his displeasure with Oline and maybe\r\nthrash her for her doings, here was his chance--a Heaven-sent chance\r\nto do that thing. They were alone in the house; the children had gone\r\nafter the men when they went. Isak stood there in the middle of the\r\nroom, and Oline was sitting by the stove. Isak cleared his throat\r\nonce or twice, just to show that he was ready to say something if he\r\npleased. But he said nothing. That was his strength of soul. What,\r\ndid he not know the number of his goats as he knew the fingers on his\r\nhands--was the woman mad? Could one of the beasts be missing, when he\r\nknew every one of them personally and talked to them every day--his\r\ngoats that were sixteen in number? Oline must have traded away one of\r\nthem the day before, when the woman from Breidablik had come up to\r\nlook at the place. "H\'m," said Isak, and this time words were on\r\nthe very tip of his tongue. What was it Oline had done? Not exactly\r\nmurder, perhaps, but something not far from it. He could speak in\r\ndeadly earnest of that sixteenth goat.\r\n\r\nBut he could not stand there for ever, in the middle of the room,\r\nsaying nothing. "H\'m," he said. "Ho! So there\'s but fifteen goats\r\nthere now, you say?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s all I make it," answered Oline gently. "But you\'d better count\r\nfor yourself and see."\r\n\r\nNow was his time--he could do it now: reach out with his hands and\r\nalter the shape of Oline considerably, with but one good grip. He\r\ncould do it. He did not do it, but said boldly, making for the door:\r\n"I\'ll say no more just now." And he went out, as if plainly showing\r\nthat, next time, he would have proper words to say, never fear.\r\n\r\n"Eleseus!" he called out.\r\n\r\nWhere was Eleseus, where were the children? Their father had something\r\nto ask them; they were big fellows now, with their eyes about them. He\r\nfound them under the floor of the barn; they had crept in as far as\r\nthey could, hiding away invisibly, but betraying themselves by an\r\nanxious whispering. Out they crept now like two sinners.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the matter was that Eleseus had found a stump of coloured\r\npencil the engineer had left behind, and started to run after him and\r\ngive it back, but the big men with their long strides were already far\r\nup in the forest. Eleseus stopped. The idea occurred to him that he\r\nmight keep the pencil--if only he could! He hunted out little Sivert,\r\nso that they might at least be two to share the guilt, and the pair of\r\nthem had crept in under the floor with their find. Oh, that stump of\r\npencil--it was an event in their lives, a wonder! They found shavings\r\nand covered them all over with signs; the pencil, they discovered,\r\nmade blue marks with one end and red with the other, and they took\r\nit in turns to use. When their father called out so loudly and\r\ninsistently, Eleseus whispered: "They\'ve come back for the pencil!"\r\nAll their joy was dashed in a moment, swept out of their minds at a\r\ntouch, and their little hearts began beating and thumping terribly.\r\nThe brothers crept forth. Eleseus held out the pencil at arm\'s length;\r\nhere it was, they had not broken it; only wished they had never seen\r\nthe thing.\r\n\r\nNo engineer was to be seen. Their hearts settled to a quieter beat; it\r\nwas heavenly to be rid of that dreadful tension.\r\n\r\n"There was a woman here yesterday," said their father.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"The woman from the place down below. Did you see her go?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Had she a goat with her?"\r\n\r\n"No," said the boys. "A goat?"\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t she have a goat with her when she left?"\r\n\r\n"No. What goat?"\r\n\r\nIsak wondered and wondered. In the evening when the animals came home,\r\nhe counted the goats once over--there were sixteen. He counted them\r\nonce more, counted them five times. There were sixteen. None missing.\r\n\r\nIsak breathed again. But what did it all mean? Oline, miserable\r\ncreature, couldn\'t she count as far as sixteen? He asked her angrily:\r\n"What\'s all this nonsense? there _are_ sixteen goats."\r\n\r\n"Are there sixteen?" she asked innocently.\r\n\r\n"Ay."\r\n\r\n"Ay, well, then."\r\n\r\n"A nice one to count, you are."\r\n\r\nOline answered quietly, in an injured tone, "Since all the goats are\r\nthere, why, then, thank Heaven, you can\'t say Oline\'s been eating them\r\nup. And well for her, poor thing."\r\n\r\nOline had taken him in completely with her trickery; he was content,\r\nimagining all was well. It did not occur to him, for instance, to\r\ncount the sheep. He did not trouble about further counting of the\r\nstock at all. After all, Oline was not as bad as she might have been;\r\nshe kept house for him after a fashion, and looked to his cattle; she\r\nwas merely a fool, and that was worst for herself. Let her stay, let\r\nher live--she was not worth troubling about. But it was a grey and\r\njoyless thing to be Isak, as life was now.\r\n\r\nYears had passed. Grass had grown on the roof of the house, even the\r\nroof of the barn, which was some years younger, was green. The\r\nwild mouse, native of the woods, had long since found way into the\r\nstorehouse. Tits and all manner of little birds swarmed about the\r\nplace; there were more birds up on the hillside; even the crows had\r\ncome. And most wonderful of all, the summer before, seagulls had\r\nappeared, seagulls coming all the way up from the coast to settle on\r\nthe fields there in the wilderness. Isak\'s farm was known far and wide\r\nto all wild creatures. And what of Eleseus and little Sivert when they\r\nsaw the gulls? Oh, \'twas some strange birds from ever so far away; not\r\nso many of them, just six white birds, all exactly alike, waddling\r\nthis way and that about the fields, and pecking at the grass now and\r\nthen.\r\n\r\n"Father, what have they come for?" asked the boys.\r\n\r\n"There\'s foul weather coming out at sea," said their father. Oh, a\r\ngrand and mysterious thing to see those gulls!\r\n\r\nAnd Isak taught his sons many other things good and useful to know.\r\nThey were of an age to go to school, but the school was many miles\r\naway down in the village, out of reach. Isak had himself taught the\r\nboys their A B C on Sundays, but \'twas not for him, not for this born\r\ntiller of the soil, to give them any manner of higher education; the\r\nCatechism and Bible history lay quietly on the shelf with the\r\ncheeses. Isak apparently thought it better for men to grow up without\r\nbook-knowledge, from the way he dealt with his boys. They were a joy\r\nand a blessing to him, the two; many a time he thought of the days\r\nwhen they had been tiny things, and their mother would not let him\r\ntouch them because his hands were sticky with resin. Ho, resin, the\r\ncleanest thing in the world! Tar and goats\' milk and marrow, for\r\ninstance, all excellent things, but resin, clean gum from the fir--not\r\na word!\r\n\r\nSo the lads grew up in a paradise of dirt and ignorance, but they were\r\nnice lads for all that when they were washed, which happened now and\r\nagain; little Sivert he was a splendid fellow, though Eleseus was\r\nsomething finer and deeper.\r\n\r\n"How do the gulls know about the weather?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"They\'re weather-sick," said his father. "But as for that they\'re no\r\nmore so than the flies. How it may be with flies, I can\'t say, if they\r\nget the gout, or feel giddy, or what. But never hit out at a fly, for\r\n\'twill only make him worse--remember that, boys! The horsefly he\'s\r\na different sort, he dies of himself. Turns up suddenly one day in\r\nsummer, and there he is; then one day suddenly he\'s gone, and that\'s\r\nthe end of him."\r\n\r\n"But how does he die?" asked Eleseus.\r\n\r\n"The fat inside him stiffens, and he lies there dead."\r\n\r\nEvery day they learned something new. Jumping down from high rocks,\r\nfor instance, to keep your tongue in your mouth, and not get it\r\nbetween your teeth. When they grew bigger, and wanted to smell nice\r\nfor going to church, the thing was to rub oneself with a little tansy\r\nthat grew on the hillside. Father was full of wisdom. He taught the\r\nboys about stones, about flint, how that the white stone was harder\r\nthan the grey; but when he had found a flint, he must also make\r\ntinder. Then he could strike fire with it. He taught them about the\r\nmoon, how when you can grip in the hollow side with your left hand\r\nit is waxing, and grip in with the right, it\'s on the wane; remember\r\nthat, boys! Now and again, Isak would go too far, and grow mysterious;\r\none Friday he declared that it was harder for a camel to enter the\r\nkingdom of heaven than for a human being to thread the eye of a\r\nneedle. Another time, telling them of the glory of the angels,\r\nhe explained that angels had stars set in their heels instead of\r\nhob-nails. Good and simple teaching, well fitted for settlers in the\r\nwilds; the schoolmaster in the village would have laughed at it all,\r\nbut Isak\'s boys found good use for it in their inner life. They were\r\ntrained and taught for their own little world, and what could be\r\nbetter? In the autumn, when animals were to be killed, the lads were\r\ngreatly curious, and fearful, and heavy at heart for the ones that\r\nwere to die. There was Isak holding with one hand, and the other ready\r\nto strike; Oline stirred the blood. The old goat was led out, bearded\r\nand wise; the boys stood peeping round the corner. "Filthy cold wind\r\nthis time," said Eleseus, and turned away to wipe his eyes. Little\r\nSivert cried more openly, could not help calling out: "Oh, poor old\r\ngoat!" When the goat was killed, Isak came up to them and gave them\r\nthis lesson: "Never stand around saying \'Poor thing\' and being pitiful\r\nwhen things are being killed. It makes them tough and harder to kill.\r\nRemember that!"\r\n\r\nSo the years passed, and now it was nearing spring again.\r\n\r\nInger had written home to say she was well, and was learning a lot\r\nof things where she was. Her little girl was big, and was called\r\nLeopoldine, after the day she was born, the 15th November. She knew\r\nall sorts of things, and was a genius at hemstitch and crochet,\r\nwonderful fine work she could do on linen or canvas.\r\n\r\nThe curious thing about this letter was that Inger had written and\r\nspelt it all herself. Isak was not so learned but that he had to get\r\nit read for him down in the village, by the man at the store; but once\r\nhe had got it into his head it stayed there; he knew it off by heart\r\nwhen he got home.\r\n\r\nAnd now he sat down with great solemnity at the head of the table,\r\nspread out the letter, and read it aloud to the boys. He was willing\r\nenough that Oline also should see how easily he could read writing,\r\nbut he did not speak so much as a word to her directly. When he had\r\nfinished, he said: "There now, Eleseus, and you, Sivert, \'tis your\r\nmother herself has written that letter and learned all these things.\r\nEven that little tiny sister of yours, she knows more than all the\r\nrest of us here. Remember that!" The boys sat still, wondering in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n"Ay, \'tis a grand thing," said Oline.\r\n\r\nAnd what did she mean by that? Was she doubting that Inger told the\r\ntruth? Or had she her suspicions as to Isak\'s reading? It was no easy\r\nmatter to get at what Oline really thought, when she sat there with\r\nher simple face, saying dark things. Isak determined to take no\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\n"And when your mother comes home, boys, you shall learn to write too,"\r\nsaid he to the lads.\r\n\r\nOline shifted some clothes that were hanging near the stove to\r\ndry; shifted a pot, shifted the clothes again, and busied herself\r\ngenerally. She was thinking all the time.\r\n\r\n"So fine and grand as everything\'s getting here," she said at last. "I\r\ndo think you might have bought a paper of coffee for the house."\r\n\r\n"_Coffee_?" said Isak. It slipped out.\r\n\r\nOline answered quietly: "Up to now I\'ve bought a little now and again\r\nout of my own money, but...."\r\n\r\nCoffee was a thing of dreams and fairy tales for Isak, a rainbow.\r\nOline was talking nonsense, of course. He was not angry with her,\r\nno; but, slow of thought as he was, he called to mind at last her\r\nbartering with the Lapps, and he said bitterly:\r\n\r\n"Ay, I\'ll buy you coffee, that I will. A paper of coffee, was it? Why\r\nnot a pound? A pound of coffee, while you\'re about it."\r\n\r\n"No need to talk that way, Isak. My brother Nils, he gets coffee; down\r\nat Breidablik, too, they\'ve coffee."\r\n\r\n"Ay, for they\'ve no milk. Not a drop of milk on the place, they\'ve\r\nnot."\r\n\r\n"That\'s as it may be. But you that know such a lot, and read writing\r\nas pat as a cockroach running, you ought to know that coffee\'s a thing\r\nshould be in everybody\'s house."\r\n\r\n"You creature!" said Isak.\r\n\r\nAt that Oline sat down and was not to be silenced. "As for that\r\nInger," said she, "if so be I may dare to say such a word...."\r\n\r\n"Say what you will, \'tis all one to me."\r\n\r\n"She\'ll be coming home, and learned everything of sorts. And beads and\r\nfeathers in her hat, maybe?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, that may be."\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Oline; "and she can thank me a little for all the way she\'s\r\ngrown so fine and grand."\r\n\r\n"You?" asked Isak. It slipped out.\r\n\r\nOline answered humbly: "Ay, since \'twas my modest doing that she ever\r\nwent away."\r\n\r\nIsak was speechless at that; all his words were checked, he sat there\r\nstaring. Had he heard aright? Oline sat there looking as if she had\r\nsaid nothing. No, in a battle of words Isak was altogether lost.\r\n\r\nHe swung out of the house, full of dark thoughts. Oline, that beast\r\nthat throve in wickedness and grew fat on it--why had he not wrung her\r\nneck the first year? So he thought, trying to pull himself together.\r\nHe could have done it--he? Couldn\'t he, though! No one better.\r\n\r\nAnd then a ridiculous thing happened. Isak went into the shed and\r\ncounted the goats. There they are with their kids, the full number.\r\nHe counts the cows, the pig, fourteen hens, two calves. "I\'d all but\r\nforgotten the sheep," he says to himself; he counts the sheep, and\r\npretends to be all anxiety lest there should be any missing there.\r\nIsak knows very well that there is a sheep missing; he has known that\r\na long time; why should he let it appear otherwise? It was this way.\r\nOline had tricked him nicely once before, saying one of the goats was\r\ngone, though all the goats were there as they should be; he had made a\r\ngreat fuss about it at the time, but to no purpose. It was always the\r\nsame when he came into conflict with Oline. Then, in the autumn, at\r\nslaughtering time, he had seen at once that there was one ewe short,\r\nbut he had not found courage to call her to account for it at the\r\ntime. And he had not found that courage since.\r\n\r\nBut today he is stern; Isak is stern. Oline has made him thoroughly\r\nangry this time. He counts the sheep over again, putting his\r\nforefinger on each and counting aloud--Oline may hear it if she likes,\r\nif she should happen to be outside. And he says many hard things about\r\nOline--says them out loud; how that she uses a new method of her own\r\nin feeding sheep, a method that simply makes them vanish--here\'s a ewe\r\nsimply vanished. She is a thieving baggage, nothing less, and she may\r\nknow it! Oh, he would just have liked Oline to be standing outside and\r\nhear it, and be thoroughly frightened for once.\r\n\r\nHe strides out from the shed, goes to the stable and counts the horse;\r\nfrom there he will go in--will go into the house and speak his mind.\r\nHe walks so fast that his shirt stands out like a very angry shirt\r\nbehind him. But Oline as like as not has noticed something, looking\r\nout through the glass window; she appears in the doorway, quietly and\r\nsteadily, with buckets in her hands, on her way to the cowshed.\r\n\r\n"What have you done with that ewe with the flat ears?" he asks.\r\n\r\n"Ewe?" she asks.\r\n\r\n"Ay. If she\'d been here she\'d have had two lambs by now. What have\r\nyou done with them? She always had two. You\'ve done me out of three\r\ntogether, do you understand?"\r\n\r\nOline is altogether overwhelmed, altogether annihilated by the\r\naccusation; she wags her head, and her legs seem to melt away under\r\nher--she might fall and hurt herself. Her head is busy all the time;\r\nher ready wit had always helped her, always served her well; it must\r\nnot fail her now.\r\n\r\n"I steal goats and I steal the sheep," she says quietly. "And what\r\ndo I do with them, I should like to know? I don\'t eat them up all by\r\nmyself, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"You know best what you do with them."\r\n\r\n"Ho! As if I didn\'t have enough and to spare of meat and food and all,\r\nwith what you give me, Isak, that I should have to steal more? But\r\nI\'ll say that, anyway, I\'ve never needed so much, all these years."\r\n\r\n"Well, what have, you done with the sheep? Has Os-Anders had it?"\r\n\r\n"Os-Anders?" Oline has to set down the buckets and fold her hands."\r\nMay I never have more guilt to answer for! What\'s all this about a ewe\r\nand lambs you\'re talking of? Is it the goat you mean, with the flat\r\nears?"\r\n\r\n"You creature!" said Isak, turning away.\r\n\r\n"Well, if you\'re not a miracle, Isak, I will say.... Here you\'ve all\r\nyou could wish for every sort, and a heavenly host of sheep and goats\r\nand all in your own shed, and you\'ve not enough. How should I know\r\nwhat sheep, and what two lambs, you\'re trying to get out of me now?\r\nYou should be thanking the Lord for His mercies from generation to\r\ngeneration, that you should. \'Tis but this summer and a bit of a way\r\nto next winter, and you\'ve the lambing season once more, and three\r\ntimes as many again."\r\n\r\nOh, that woman Oline!\r\n\r\nIsak went off grumbling like a bear. "Fool I was not to murder her the\r\nfirst day!" he thought, calling himself all manner of names. "Idiot,\r\nlump of rubbish that I was! But it\'s not too late yet; just wait, let\r\nher go to the cowshed if she likes. It wouldn\'t be wise to do anything\r\ntonight, but tomorrow ... ay, tomorrow morning\'s the time. Three sheep\r\nlost and gone! And coffee, did she say!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day was fated to bring a great event. There came a visitor to the\r\nfarm--Geissler came. It was not yet summer on the moors, but Geissler\r\npaid no heed to the state of the ground; he came on foot, in rich high\r\nboots with broad, shiny tops; yellow gloves, too, he wore, and was\r\nelegant to see; a man from the village carried his things.\r\n\r\nHe had come, as a matter of fact, to buy a piece of Isak\'s land, up in\r\nthe hills--a copper mine. And what about the price? Also, by the way,\r\nhe had a message from Inger--good girl, every one liked her; he had\r\nbeen in Trondhjem, and seen her. "Isak, you\'ve put in some work here."\r\n\r\n"Ay, I dare say And you\'ve seen Inger?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s that you\'ve got over there? Built a mill of your own, have\r\nyou? grind your own corn? Excellent. And you\'ve turned up a good bit\r\nof ground since I was here last."\r\n\r\n"Is she well?"\r\n\r\n"Eh? Oh, your wife!--yes, she\'s well and fit. Let\'s go in the next\r\nroom. I\'ll tell you all about it."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis not in order," put in Oline. Oline had her own reasons for not\r\nwishing them to go in. They went into the little room nevertheless,\r\nand closed the door. Oline stood in the kitchen and could hear\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nGeissler sat down, slapped his knee with a powerful hand, and there he\r\nwas--master of Isak\'s fate.\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t sold that copper tract yet?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Good. I\'ll buy it myself. Yes, I\'ve seen Inger and some other people\r\ntoo. She\'ll be out before long, if I\'m not greatly mistaken--the case\r\nhas been submitted to the King."\r\n\r\n"The King?"\r\n\r\n"The King, yes. I went in to have a talk with your wife--they managed\r\nit for me, of course, no difficulty about that--and we had a long\r\ntalk. \'Well, Inger, how are you getting on? Nicely, what?\' \'Why, I\'ve\r\nno cause to complain.\'\' Like to be home again?\' \'Ay, I\'ll not say no.\'\r\n\'And so you shall before very long,\' said I. And I\'ll tell you this\r\nmuch, Isak, she\'s a good girl, is Inger. No blubbering, not so much\r\nas a tear, but smiling and laughing ... they\'ve fixed up that trouble\r\nwith her mouth, by the way--operation--sewed it up again. \'Good-bye,\r\nthen,\' said I. \'You won\'t be here very long, I\'ll promise you that.\'\r\n\r\n"Then I went to the Governor--he saw me, of course, no difficulty\r\nabout that. \'You\'ve a woman here,\' said I,\' that ought to be out of\r\nthe place, and back in her home--Inger Sellanraa.\' \'Inger?\' said he;\r\n\'why, yes. She\'s a good sort--I wish we could keep her for twenty\r\nyears,\' said he. \'Well, you won\'t,\' said I. \'She\'s been here too long\r\nalready.\' \'Too long?\' says he. \'Do you know what she\'s in for?\' \'I\r\nknow all about it,\' says I, \'being Lensmand in the district.\' \'Oh,\'\r\nsays he, \'won\'t you sit down?\' Quite the proper thing to say, of\r\ncourse. \'Why,\' says the Governor then, \'we do what we can for her\r\nhere, and her little girl too. So she\'s from your part of the country,\r\nis she? We\'ve helped her to get a sewing-machine of her own; she\'s\r\ngone through the workshops right to the top, and we\'ve taught her a\r\ndeal--weaving, household work, dyeing, cutting out. Been here too\r\nlong, you say?\' Well, I\'d got my answer ready for that all right, but\r\nit could wait, so I only said her case had been badly muddled, and had\r\nto be taken up again; now, after the revision of the criminal code,\r\nshe\'d probably have been acquitted altogether. And I told him about\r\nthe hare. \'A hare?\' says the Governor. \'A hare,\' says I. \'And the\r\nchild was born with a hare-lip.\' \'Oh,\' says he, smiling, \'I see. And\r\nyou think they ought to have made more allowance for that?\' \'They\r\ndidn\'t make any at all,\' said I, \'for it wasn\'t mentioned.\' \'Well, I\r\ndare say it\'s not so bad, after all.\' \'Bad enough for her, anyway.\'\r\n\'Do you believe a hare can work miracles, then?\' says he. \'As to\r\nthat,\' said I, \'whether a hare can work miracles or not\'s a matter I\r\nwon\'t discuss just now. The question is, what effect the _sight_ of a\r\nhare might have on a woman with her disfigurement, in her condition.\'\r\nWell, he thought over that for a bit. \'H\'m,\' says he at last. \'Maybe,\r\nmaybe. Anyhow, we\'re not concerned with that here. All we have to\r\ndo is to take over the people they send us; not to revise their\r\nsentences. And according to her sentence, Inger\'s not yet finished her\r\ntime.\'\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I started on what I wanted to say all along. \'There was\r\na serious oversight made in bringing her here to begin with,\' said I.\r\n\'An oversight?\' \'Yes. In the first place, she ought never to have been\r\nsent across the country at all in the state she was in.\' He looks at\r\nme stiffly. \'No, that\'s perfectly true,\' says he. \'But it\'s nothing to\r\ndo with us here, you know.\' \'And in the second place,\' said I, \'she\r\nought certainly not to have been in the prison for full two months\r\nwithout any notice taken of her condition by the authorities here.\'\r\nThat put him out, I could see; he said nothing for quite a while. \'Are\r\nyou instructed to act on her behalf?\' says he at last. \'Yes, I am,\'\r\nsaid I. Well, then, he started on about how pleased they had been with\r\nher, and telling me over again all they\'d taught her and done for her\r\nthere--taught her to write too, he said. And the little girl had been\r\nput out to nurse with decent people, and so on. Then I told him how\r\nthings were at home, with Inger away. Two youngsters left behind,\r\nand only a hired woman to look after them, and all the rest. \'I\'ve a\r\nstatement from her husband,\' said I, \'that I can submit whether the\r\ncase be taken up for thorough revision, or an application be made\r\nfor a pardon.\' \'I\'d like to see that statement,\' says the Governor.\r\n\'Right,\' said I. \'I\'ll bring it along tomorrow in visiting hours.\'"\r\n\r\nIsak sat listening--it was thrilling to hear, a wonderful tale from\r\nforeign parts. He followed Geissler\'s mouth with slavish eyes.\r\n\r\nGeissler went on: "I went straight back to the hotel and wrote out a\r\nstatement; did the whole thing myself, you understand, and signed it\r\n\'Isak Sellanraa.\' Don\'t imagine, though, I said a word against the way\r\nthey\'d managed things in the prison. Not a word. Next day I went along\r\nwith the paper. \'Won\'t you sit down?\' says the Governor, the moment I\r\ngot inside the door. He read through what I\'d written, nodded here and\r\nthere, and at last he says: \'Very good, very good indeed. It\'d hardly\r\ndo, perhaps, to have the case brought up again for revision, but....\'\r\n\'Wait a bit,\' said I. \'I\'ve another document that I think will make it\r\nright.\' Had him there again, you see. \'Well,\' he says, all of a hurry,\r\n\'I\'ve been thinking over the matter since yesterday, and I consider\r\nthere\'s good and sufficient grounds to apply for a pardon.\' \'And the\r\napplication would have the Governor\'s support?\' I asked. \'Certainly;\r\nyes, I\'ll give it my best recommendation.\' Then I bowed and said: \'In\r\nthat case, there will be no difficulty about the pardon, of course. I\r\nthank you, sir, on behalf of a suffering woman and a stricken home.\'\r\nThen says he: \'I don\'t think there should be any need of further\r\ndeclarations--from the district, I mean--about her case. You know the\r\nwoman yourself--that should be quite enough.\' I knew well enough, of\r\ncourse, why he wanted the thing settled quietly as possible, so I just\r\nagreed: said it would only delay the proceedings to collect further\r\nmaterial....\r\n\r\n"And there you are, Isak, that\'s the whole story." Geissler looked at\r\nhis watch. "And now let\'s get to business. Can you go with me up to\r\nthe ground again?"\r\n\r\nIsak was a stony creature, a stump of a man; he did not find it\r\neasy to change the subject all at once; he was all preoccupied with\r\nthoughts and wondering, and began asking questions of this and that.\r\nHe learned that the application had been sent up to the King, and\r\nmight be decided in one of the first State Councils. "\'Tis all a\r\nmiracle," said he.\r\n\r\nThen they went up into the hills; Geissler, his man, and Isak, and\r\nwere out for some hours. In a very short time Geissler had followed\r\nthe lie of the copper vein over a wide stretch of land and marked out\r\nthe limits of the tract he wanted. Here, there, and everywhere he was.\r\nBut no fool, for all his hasty movements; quick to judge, but sound\r\nenough for all that.\r\n\r\nWhen they came back to the farm once more with a sack full of samples\r\nof ore--he got out writing materials and sat down to write. He did not\r\nbury himself completely in his writing, though, but talked now and\r\nagain. "Well, Isak, it won\'t be such a big sum this time, for the\r\nland, but I can give you a couple of hundred _Daler_ anyway, on the\r\nspot." Then he wrote again. "Remind me before I go, I want to see that\r\nmill of yours," said he. Then he caught sight of some blue and red\r\nmarks on the frame of the loom, and asked."Who drew that?" Now that\r\nwas Eleseus, had drawn a horse and a goat; he used his coloured pencil\r\non the loom and woodwork anywhere, having no paper. "Not at all bad,"\r\nsaid Geissler, and gave Eleseus a coin.\r\n\r\nGeissler went on writing for a bit, and then looked up. "You\'ll be\r\nhaving other people taking up land hereabouts before long."\r\n\r\nAt this the man with him spoke: "There\'s some started already."\r\n\r\n"Ho! And who might that be?"\r\n\r\n"Well, first, there\'s the folk at Breidablik, as they call it--man\r\nBrede, at Breidablik."\r\n\r\n"Him--puh!" sniffed Geissler contemptuously.\r\n\r\n"Then there\'s one or two others besides, have bought."\r\n\r\n"Doubt if they\'re any good, any of them," said Geissler. And noticing\r\nat the same moment that there were two boys in the room, he caught\r\nhold of little Sivert and gave him a coin. A remarkable man was\r\nGeissler. His eyes, by the way, had begun to look soreish; there was a\r\nkind of redness at the edges. Might have been sleeplessness; the same\r\nthing comes at times from drinking of strong waters. But he did not\r\nlook dejected at all; and for all his talking of this and that between\r\ntimes, he was thinking no doubt of his document all the while, for\r\nsuddenly he picked up the pen and wrote a piece more.\r\n\r\nAt last he seemed to have finished.\r\n\r\nHe turned to Isak: "Well, as I said, it won\'t make you a rich man all\r\nat once, this deal. But there may be more to come. We\'ll fix it up so\r\nthat you get more later on. Anyhow, I can give you two hundred now."\r\n\r\nIsak understood but little of the whole thing, but two hundred _Daler_\r\nwas at any rate another miracle, and an unreasonable sum. He would get\r\nit on paper, of course, not paid in cash, but let that be. Isak had\r\nother things in his head just now.\r\n\r\n"And you think she\'ll be pardoned?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Eh? Oh, your wife! Well, if there\'d been a telegraph office in the\r\nvillage, I\'d have wired to Trondhjem and asked if she hadn\'t been set\r\nfree already."\r\n\r\nIsak had heard men speak of the telegraph; a wonderful thing, a string\r\nhung up on big poles, something altogether above the common earth. The\r\nmention of it now seemed to shake his faith in Geissler\'s big words,\r\nand he put in anxiously: "But suppose the King says no?"\r\n\r\nSaid Geissler: "In that case, I send in my supplementary material, a\r\nfull account of the whole affair. And then they _must_ set her free.\r\nThere\'s not a shadow of doubt."\r\n\r\nThen he read over what he had written; the contract for purchase\r\nof the land. Two hundred _Daler_ cash down, and later, a nice high\r\npercentage of receipts from working, or ultimate disposal by further\r\nsale, of the copper tract. "Sign your name here," said Geissler.\r\n\r\nIsak would have signed readily enough, but he was no scholar; in all\r\nhis life he had got no farther than cutting initials in wood. But\r\nthere was that hateful creature Oline looking on; he took up the\r\npen--a beastly thing, too light to handle anyway--turned it right\r\nend down, and _wrote_--wrote his name. Whereupon Geissler added\r\nsomething, presumably an explanation, and the man he had brought with\r\nhim signed as a witness.\r\n\r\nSettled.\r\n\r\nBut Oline was still there, standing immovable--it was indeed but now\r\nshe had turned so stiff. What was to happen?\r\n\r\n"Dinner on the table, Oline," said Isak, possibly with a tough of\r\ndignity, after having signed his name in writing on a paper. "Such as\r\nwe can offer," he added to Geissler.\r\n\r\n"Smells good enough," said Geissler. "Sound meat and drink. Here,\r\nIsak, here\'s your money!" Geissler took out his pocket-book--thick and\r\nfat it was, too--drew from it two bundles of notes and laid them down.\r\n"Count it over yourself."\r\n\r\nNot a movement, not a sound.\r\n\r\n"Isak," said Geissler again.\r\n\r\n"Ay. Yes," answered Isak, and murmured, overwhelmed, "\'Tis not that\r\nI\'ve asked for it, nor would--after all you\'ve done."\r\n\r\n"Ten tens in that--should be, and twenty fives here," said Geissler\r\nshortly. "And I hope there\'ll be more than that by a long way for your\r\nshare soon."\r\n\r\nAnd then it was that Oline recovered from her trance. The wonder had\r\nhappened after all. She set the food on the table.\r\n\r\nNext morning Geissler went out to the river to look at the mill.\r\nIt was small enough, and roughly built; ay, a mill for dwarfs, for\r\ntrollfolk, but strong and useful for a man\'s work. Isak led his guest\r\na little farther up the river, and showed him another fall he had been\r\nworking on a bit; it was to turn a saw, if so be God gave him health.\r\n"The only thing," he said, "it\'s a heavy long way from school: I\'ll\r\nhave to get the lads to stay down in the village." But Geissler,\r\nalways so quick to find a way, saw nothing to worry about here. "There\r\nare more people buying and settling here now," said he. "It won\'t be\r\nlong before there\'s enough to start a school."\r\n\r\n"Ay, maybe, but not before my boys are grown."\r\n\r\n"Well, why not let them live on a farm down in the village? You could\r\ndrive in with the boys and some food, and bring them up again three\r\nweeks--six weeks after; it would be easy enough for you, surely?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, maybe," said Isak.\r\n\r\nAy, all things would be easy enough, if Inger came home. House and\r\nland and food and grand things enough, and a big sum of money too he\r\nhad, and his strength; he was hard as nails. Health and strength--\r\nay, full and unspoiled, unworn, in every way, the health and strength\r\nof a man.\r\n\r\nWhen Geissler had gone, Isak began thinking of many presumptuous\r\nthings. Ay, for had not Geissler, that blessing to them all, said at\r\nparting that he would send a message very soon--would send a telegram\r\nas soon as ever he could. "You can call in at the post office in a\r\nfortnight\'s time," he had said. And that in itself was a wonderful\r\nthing enough. Isak set to work making a seat for the cart. A seat, of\r\ncourse, that could be taken off when using the cart for manure, but to\r\nbe put in again when any one wanted to drive. And when he had got\r\nthe seat made, it looked so white and new that it had to be painted\r\ndarker. As for that, there were things enough that had to be done! The\r\nwhole place wanted painting, to begin with. And he had been thinking\r\nfor years past of building a proper barn with a bridge, to house\r\nin the crop. He had thought, too, of getting that saw set up and\r\nfinished; of fencing in all his cultivated ground; of building a boat\r\non the lake up in the hills. Many things he had thought of doing. But\r\nhard as he worked, unreasonably hard--what did it help against time?\r\nTime--it was the time that was too short. It was Sunday before he\r\nknew, and then directly after, lo it was Sunday again!\r\n\r\nPaint he would, in any case; that was decided and emphatic. The\r\nbuildings stood there grey and bare--stood there like houses in their\r\nshirt sleeves. There was time yet before the busy season; the spring\r\nwas hardly begun yet; the young things were out, but there was frost\r\nin the ground still.\r\n\r\nIsak goes down to the village, taking with him a few score of eggs for\r\nsale, and brings back paint. There was enough for one building, for\r\nthe barn, and it was painted red. He fetches up more paint, yellow\r\nochre this time, for the house itself. "Ay, \'tis as I said, here\'s\r\ngoing to be fine and grand," grumbles Oline every day. Ay, Oline could\r\nguess, no doubt, that her time at Sellanraa would soon be up; she was\r\ntough and strong enough to bear it, though not without bitterness.\r\nIsak, on his part, no longer sought to settle up old scores with her\r\nnow, though she pilfered and put away things lavishly enough towards\r\nthe end. He made her a present of a young wether; after all, she had\r\nbeen with him a long time, and worked for little pay. And Oline had\r\nnot been so bad with the children; she was not stern and strictly\r\nrighteous and that sort of thing, but had a knack of dealing with\r\nchildren: listened to what they said, and let them do more or less\r\nas they pleased. If they came round while she was making cheese, she\r\nwould give them a bit to taste; if they begged to be let off washing\r\ntheir faces one Sunday, she would let them off.\r\n\r\nWhen Isak had given his walls a first coat, he went down to the\r\nvillage again and brought up all the paint he could carry. Three coats\r\nhe put on in all, and white on the window-frames and corners. To come\r\nback now and look at his home there on the hillside, it was like\r\nlooking at a fairy palace. The wilderness was inhabited and\r\nunrecognizable, a blessing had come upon it, life had arisen there\r\nfrom a long dream, human creatures lived there, children played about\r\nthe houses. And the forest stretched away, big and kindly, right up to\r\nthe blue heights.\r\n\r\nBut the last time Isak went down for paint, the storekeeper gave him\r\na blue envelope with a crest on, and 5 _skilling_ to pay. It was a\r\ntelegram which had been forwarded by post, and was from Lensmand\r\nGeissler. A blessing on that man Geissler, wonderful man that he was!\r\nHe telegraphed these few words, that Inger was free, "Home soonest\r\npossible: Geissler." And at this the store took to whirling curiously\r\nround and round; the counter and the people in the shop were suddenly\r\nfar away. Isak felt rather than heard himself saying, "_Herregud_!"\r\nand "Praise and thanks to God."\r\n\r\n"She might be here no later than tomorrow the day," said the\r\nstorekeeper, "if so be she\'s left Trondhjem in time."\r\n\r\n"Ho!" said Isak.\r\n\r\nHe waited till the next day. The carrier came up with letters, from\r\nthe landing-stage where the steamer put in, but no Inger. "Then she\r\nwon\'t be here now till next week," the storekeeper said.\r\n\r\nAlmost as well, after all, that there was time to wait--Isak has many\r\nthings to do. Should he forget himself altogether, and neglect his\r\nland? He sets off home again and begins carting out manure. It is\r\nsoon done. He sticks a crowbar into the earth, noting how the frost\r\ndisappears from day to day. The sun is big and strong now, the snow\r\nis gone, green showing everywhere; the cattle are out to graze. Isak\r\nploughs one day, and a few days later he is sowing corn, planting\r\npotatoes. Ho, the youngsters too, planting potatoes like angels;\r\nblessed little hands they have, and what can their father do but\r\nwatch?\r\n\r\nThen Isak washes out the cart down by the river, and puts the seat\r\nin. Talks to the lads about a little journey; he must have a little\r\njourney down to the village.\r\n\r\n"But aren\'t you going to walk?"\r\n\r\n"Not today. I\'ve took into my head to go down with horse and cart\r\ntoday."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t we come too?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got to be good boys, and stay at home this time. Your own\r\nmother\'ll be coming very soon, and she\'ll learn you a many things."\r\n\r\nEleseus is all for learning things; he asks: "Father, when you did\r\nthat writing on the paper--what does it feel like?"\r\n\r\n"Why, \'tis hardly to feel at all; just like a bit of nothing in the\r\nhand."\r\n\r\n"But doesn\'t it slip, like on the ice?"\r\n\r\n"What slip?"\r\n\r\n"The pen thing, that you write with?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, there\'s the pen. But you have to learn to steer it, you\'ll see."\r\n\r\nBut little Sivert he was of another mind, and said nothing about pens;\r\nhe wanted to ride in the cart; just to sit up on the seat before the\r\nhorse was put in, and drive like that, driving ever so fast in a cart\r\nwithout a horse. And it was all his doing that father let them both\r\nsit up and ride with him a long way down the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI\r\n\r\n\r\nIsak drives on till he comes to a tarn, a bit of a pool on the moor,\r\nand there he pulls up. A pool on the moors, black, deep down, and the\r\nlittle surface of the water perfectly still; Isak knew what that was\r\ngood for; he had hardly used any other mirror in his life than such a\r\nbit of water on the moors. Look how nice and neat he is today, with a\r\nred shirt; he takes out a pair of scissors now, and trims his beard.\r\nVain barge of a man; is he going to make himself handsome all at once,\r\nand cut away five years\' growth of iron beard? He cuts and cuts away,\r\nlooking at himself in his glass. He might have done all this at home,\r\nof course, but was shy of doing it before Oline; it was quite enough\r\nto stand there right in front of her nose and put on a red shirt. He\r\ncuts and cuts away, a certain amount of beard falls into his patent\r\nmirror. The horse grows impatient at last and is moving on; Isak is\r\nfain to be content with himself as he is, and gets up again. And\r\nindeed he feels somehow younger already--devil knows what it could be,\r\nbut somehow slighter of build. Isak drives down to the village.\r\n\r\nNext day the mail boat comes in. Isak climbs up on a rock by the\r\nstorekeeper\'s wharf, looking out, but still no Inger to be\r\nseen. Passengers there were, grown-up folk and children with\r\nthem--_Herregud_!--but no Inger. He had kept in the background,\r\nsitting on his rock, but there was no need to stay behind any longer;\r\nhe gets down and goes to the steamer. Barrels and cases trundling\r\nashore, people and mailbags, but still Isak lacked what he had come\r\nfor. There was something there--a woman with a little girl, up at the\r\nentrance to the landing-stage already; but the woman was prettier to\r\nlook at than Inger--though Inger was good enough. What--why--but it\r\nwas Inger! "H\'m," said Isak, and trundled up to meet them. Greetings:\r\n"_Goddag_," said Inger, and held out her hand; a little cold, a little\r\npale after the voyage, and being ill on the way. Isak, he just stood\r\nthere; at last he said:\r\n\r\n"H\'m. \'Tis a fine day and all."\r\n\r\n"I saw you down there all along," said Inger. "But I didn\'t want to\r\ncome crowding ashore with the rest. So you\'re down in the village\r\ntoday?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, yes. H\'m."\r\n\r\n"And all\'s well at home, everything all right?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, thank you kindly."\r\n\r\n"This is Leopoldine; she\'s stood the voyage much better than I did.\r\nThis is your papa, Leopoldine; come and shake hands nicely."\r\n\r\n"H\'m," said Isak, feeling very strange--ay, he was like a stranger\r\nwith them all at once.\r\n\r\nSaid Inger: "If you find a sewing-machine down by the boat, it\'ll be\r\nmine. And there\'s a chest as well."\r\n\r\nOff goes Isak, goes off more than willingly, after the chest; the\r\nmen on board showed him which it was. The sewing-machine was another\r\nmatter; Inger had to go down and find that herself. It was a handsome\r\nbox, of curious shape, with a round cover over, and a handle to carry\r\nit by--a sewing-machine in these parts! Isak hoisted the chest and the\r\nsewing-machine on to his shoulders, and turned to his wife and child:\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have these up in no time, and come back for her after."\r\n\r\n"Come back for who?" asked Inger, with a smile. "Did you think she\r\ncouldn\'t walk by herself, a big girl like that?"\r\n\r\nThey walked up to where Isak had left the horse and cart.\r\n\r\n"New horse, you\'ve got?" said Inger. "And what\'s that you\'ve got--a\r\ncart with a seat in?"\r\n\r\n"Tis but natural," said Isak. "What I was going to say: Wouldn\'t you\r\ncare for a little bit of something to eat? I\'ve brought things all\r\nready."\r\n\r\n"Wait till we get a bit on the way," said she. "Leopoldine, can you\r\nsit up by yourself?"\r\n\r\nBut her father won\'t have it; she might fall down under the wheels.\r\n"You sit up with her and drive yourself."\r\n\r\nSo they drove off, Isak walking behind.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the two in the cart as he walked. There was Inger, all\r\nstrangely dressed and strange and fine to look at, with no hare-lip\r\nnow, but only a tiny scar on the upper lip. No hissing when she\r\ntalked; she spoke all clearly, and that was the wonder of it all. A\r\ngrey-and-red woollen wrap with a fringe looked grand on her dark hair.\r\nShe turned round in her seat on the cart, and called to him:\r\n\r\n"It\'s a pity you didn\'t bring a skin rug with you; it\'ll be cold, I\r\ndoubt, for the child towards night."\r\n\r\n"She can have my jacket," said Isak. "And when we get up in the woods,\r\nI\'ve left a rug there on the way."\r\n\r\n"Oh, have you a rug up in the woods?"\r\n\r\n"Ay. I wouldn\'t bring it down all the way, for if you didn\'t come\r\ntoday."\r\n\r\n"H\'m. What was it you said before--the boys are well and all?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, thank you kindly."\r\n\r\n"They\'ll be big lads now, I doubt?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, that\'s true. They\'ve just been planting potatoes."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said the mother, smiling, and shaking her head. "Can they plant\r\npotatoes already?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Eleseus, he gives a hand with this, and little Sivert helps with\r\nthat," said Isak proudly.\r\n\r\nLittle Leopoldine was asking for something to eat. Oh, the pretty\r\nlittle creature; a ladybird up on a cart! She talked with a sing in\r\nher voice, with a strange accent, as she had learned in Trondhjem.\r\nInger had to translate now and again. She had her brothers\' features,\r\nthe brown eyes and oval cheeks that all had got from their mother; ay,\r\nthey were their mother\'s children, and well that they were so! Isak\r\nwas something shy of his little girl, shy of her tiny shoes and long,\r\nthin, woollen stockings and short frock; when she had come to meet her\r\nstrange papa she had curtseyed and offered him a tiny hand.\r\n\r\nThey got up into the woods and halted for a rest and a meal all round.\r\nThe horse had his fodder; Leopoldine ran about in the heather, eating\r\nas she went.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve not changed much," said Inger, looking at her husband.\r\n\r\nIsak glanced aside, and said, "No, you think not? But you\'ve grown so\r\ngrand and all."\r\n\r\n"Ha ha! Nay, I\'m an old woman now," said she jestingly.\r\n\r\nIt was no use trying to hide the fact: Isak was not a bit sure of\r\nhimself now. He could find no self-possession, but still kept aloof,\r\nshy, as if ashamed of himself. How old could his wife be now? She\r\ncouldn\'t be less than thirty--that is to say, she couldn\'t be more, of\r\ncourse. And Isak, for all that he was eating already, must pull up a\r\ntwig of heather and fall to biting that.\r\n\r\n"What--are you eating heather?" cried Inger laughingly.\r\n\r\nIsak threw down the twig, took a mouthful of food, and going over to\r\nthe road, took the horse by its forelegs and heaved up its forepart\r\ntill the animal stood on its hindlegs. Inger looked on with\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing that for?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, he\'s so playful," said Isak, and set the horse down again.\r\n\r\nNow what _had_ he done that for? A sudden impulse to do just that\r\nthing; perhaps he had done it to hide his embarrassment.\r\n\r\nThey started off again, and all three of them walked a bit of the way.\r\nThey came to a new farm.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that there?" asked Inger.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis Brede\'s place, that he\'s bought."\r\n\r\n"Brede?"\r\n\r\n"Breidablik, he calls it. There\'s wide moorland, but the timber\'s\r\npoor."\r\n\r\nThey talked of the new place as they passed on. Isak noticed that\r\nBrede\'s cart was still left out in the open.\r\n\r\nThe child was growing sleepy now, and Isak took her gently in his arms\r\nand carried her. They walked and walked. Leopoldine was soon fast\r\nasleep, and Inger said:\r\n\r\n"We\'ll wrap her up in the rug, and she can lie down in the cart and\r\nsleep as long as she likes."\r\n\r\n"\'Twill shake her all to pieces," said Isak, and carries her on. They\r\ncross the moors and get into the woods again.\r\n\r\n"_Ptro_!" says Inger, and the horse stops. She takes the child from\r\nIsak, gets him to shift the chest and the sewing-machine, making a\r\nplace for Leopoldine in the bottom of the cart. "Shaken? not a bit of\r\nit!"\r\n\r\nIsak fixes things to rights, tucks his little daughter up in the rug,\r\nand lays his jacket folded under her head. Then off again.\r\n\r\nMan and wife gossiping of this and that. The sun is up till late in\r\nthe evening, and the weather warm.\r\n\r\n"Oline," says Inger--"where does she sleep?"\r\n\r\n"In the little room."\r\n\r\n"Ho! And the boys?"\r\n\r\n"They\'ve their own bed in the big room. There\'s two beds there, just\r\nas when you went away."\r\n\r\n"Looking at you now," said Inger, "I can see you\'re just as you were\r\nbefore. And those shoulders of yours, they\'ve carried some burdens up\r\nalong this way, but they\'ve not grown the weaker by it, seems."\r\n\r\n"H\'m. Maybe. What I was going to say: How it was like with you all the\r\nyears there? Bearable like?" Oh, Isak was soft at heart now; he asked\r\nher that, and wondered in his mind.\r\n\r\nAnd Inger said: "Ay, \'twas nothing to complain of."\r\n\r\nThey talked more feelingly together, and Isak asked if she wasn\'t\r\ntired of walking, and would get up in the cart a bit of way. "No,\r\nthanks all the same," said she. "But I don\'t know what\'s the matter\r\nwith me today; after being ill on the boat, I feel hungry all the\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"Why, did you want something, then?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, if you don\'t mind stopping so long."\r\n\r\nOh, that Inger, maybe \'twas not for herself at all, but for Isak\'s\r\nsake. She would have him eat again; he had spoiled his last meal\r\nchewing twigs of heather.\r\n\r\nAnd the evening was light and warm, and they had but a few miles more\r\nto go; they sat down to eat again.\r\n\r\nInger took a parcel from her box, and said:\r\n\r\n"I\'ve a few things I brought along for the boys. Let\'s go over there\r\nin the bushes, it\'s warmer there."\r\n\r\nThey went across to the bushes, and she showed him the things; neat\r\nbraces with buckles for the boys to wear, copy-books with copies at\r\nthe top of the page, a pencil for each, a pocket-knife for each. And\r\nthere was an excellent book for herself, she had. "Look, with my name\r\nin and all. A prayer-book." It was a present from the Governor, by way\r\nof remembrance.\r\n\r\nIsak admired each thing in silence. She took out a bundle of little\r\ncollars--Leopoldine\'s, they were. And gave Isak a black neckerchief\r\nfor himself, shiny as silk.\r\n\r\n"Is that for me?" said he.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it\'s for you."\r\n\r\nHe took it carefully in his hands, and stroked it.\r\n\r\n"Do you think it\'s nice?"\r\n\r\n"Nice--why I could go round the world in such."\r\n\r\nBut Isak\'s fingers were rough; they stuck in the curious silky stuff.\r\n\r\nNow Inger had no more things to show. But when she had packed them all\r\nup again, she sat there still; and the way she sat, he could see her\r\nlegs, could see her red-bordered stockings.\r\n\r\n"H\'m," said he. "Those\'ll be town-made things, I doubt?"\r\n\r\n"\'Tis wool was bought in the town, but I knitted them myself. They\'re\r\never so long--right up above the knee--look...."\r\n\r\nA little while after she heard herself whispering: "Oh, you ... you\'re\r\njust the same--the same as ever!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd after that halt they drove on again, and Inger sat up, holding the\r\nreins. "I\'ve brought a paper of coffee too," she said. "But you can\'t\r\nhave any this evening, for it\'s not roasted yet."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis more than\'s needed this evening and all," said he.\r\n\r\nAn hour later the sun goes down, and it grows colder. Inger gets down\r\nto walk. Together they tuck the rug closer about Leopoldine, and smile\r\nto see how soundly she can sleep. Man and wife talk together again on\r\ntheir way. A pleasure it is to hear Inger\'s voice; none could speak\r\nclearer than Inger now.\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t it four cows we had?" she asks.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis more than that," says he proudly. "We\'ve eight."\r\n\r\n"Eight cows!"\r\n\r\n"That is to say, counting the bull."\r\n\r\n"Have you sold any butter?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, and eggs."\r\n\r\n"What, have we chickens now?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, of course we have. And a pig."\r\n\r\nInger is so astonished at all this that she forgets herself\r\naltogether, and stops for a moment--"_Ptro_!" And Isak is proud and\r\nkeeps on, trying to overwhelm her completely.\r\n\r\n"That Geissler," he says, "you remember him? He came up a little while\r\nback."\r\n\r\n"Oh?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve sold him a copper mine."\r\n\r\n"Ho! What\'s that--a copper mine?"\r\n\r\n"Copper, yes. Up in the hills, all along the north side of the water."\r\n\r\n"You--you don\'t mean he paid you money for it?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, that he did. Geissler he wouldn\'t buy things and not pay for\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"What did you get, then?"\r\n\r\n"H\'m. Well, you might not believe it--but it was two hundred _Daler_."\r\n\r\n"You got two hundred _Daler_!" shouts Inger, stopping again with a\r\n"_Ptro_!"\r\n\r\n"I did--yes. And I\'ve paid for my land a long while back," said Isak.\r\n\r\n"Well--you are a wonder, you are!"\r\n\r\nTruly, it was a pleasure to see Inger all surprised, and make her a\r\nrich wife. Isak did not forget to add that he had no debts nor owings\r\nat the store or anywhere else. And he had not only Geissler\'s two\r\nhundred untouched, but more than that--a hundred and sixty _Daler_\r\nmore. Ay, they might well be thankful to God!\r\n\r\nThey spoke of Geissler again; Inger was able to tell how he had helped\r\nto get her set free. It had not been an easy matter for him, after\r\nall, it seemed; he had been a long time getting the matter through,\r\nand had called on the Governor ever so many times. Geissler had\r\nalso written to some of the State Councillors, or some other high\r\nauthorities; but this he had done behind the Governor\'s back, and when\r\nthe Governor heard of it he was furious, which was not surprising. But\r\nGeissler was not to be frightened; he demanded a revision of the case,\r\nnew trial, new examination, and everything. And after that the King\r\nhad to sign.\r\n\r\nEx-Lensmand Geissler had always been a good friend to them both, and\r\nthey had often wondered why; he got nothing out of it but their poor\r\nthanks--it was more than they could understand. Inger had spoken with\r\nhim in Trondhjem, and could not make him out. "He doesn\'t seem to care\r\na bit about any in the village but us," she explained.\r\n\r\n"Did he say so?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. He\'s furious with the village here. He\'d show them, he said."\r\n\r\n"Ho!"\r\n\r\n"And they\'d find out one day, and be sorry they\'d lost him, he said."\r\n\r\nThey reached the fringe of the wood, and came in sight of their home.\r\nThere were more buildings there than before, and all nicely painted.\r\nInger hardly knew the place again, and stopped dead.\r\n\r\n"You--you don\'t say that\'s our place--all that?" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nLittle Leopoldine woke at last and sat up, thoroughly rested now; they\r\nlifted her out and let her walk.\r\n\r\n"Are we there now?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Isn\'t it a pretty place?"\r\n\r\nThere were small figures moving, over by the house; it was Eleseus and\r\nSivert, keeping watch. Now they came running up. Inger was seized\r\nwith a sudden cold--a dreadful cold in the head, with sniffing and\r\ncoughing--even her eyes were all red and watering too. It always gives\r\none a dreadful cold on board ship--makes one\'s eyes wet and all!\r\n\r\nBut when the boys came nearer they stopped running all of a sudden and\r\nstared. They had forgotten what their mother looked like, and little\r\nsister they had never seen. But father--they didn\'t know him at all\r\ntill he came quite close. He had cut off his heavy beard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII\r\n\r\n\r\nAll is well now.\r\n\r\nIsak sows his oats, harrows, and rolls it in. Little Leopoldine comes\r\nand wants to sit on the roller. Sit on a roller?--nay, she\'s all too\r\nlittle and unknowing for that yet. Her brothers know better. There\'s\r\nno seat on father\'s roller.\r\n\r\nBut father thinks it fine and a pleasure to see little Leopoldine\r\ncoming up so trustingly to him already; he talks to her, and shows\r\nher how to walk nicely over the fields, and not get her shoes full of\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n"And what\'s that--why, if you haven\'t a blue frock on today--come, let\r\nme see; ay, \'tis blue, so it is. And a belt round and all. Remember\r\nwhen you came on the big ship? And the engines--did you see them?\r\nThat\'s right--and now run home to the boys again, they\'ll find you\r\nsomething to play with."\r\n\r\nOline is gone, and Inger has taken up her old work once more, in house\r\nand yard. She overdoes it a little, maybe, in cleanliness and order,\r\njust by way of showing that she was going to have things differently\r\nnow. And indeed it was wonderful to see what a change was made; even\r\nthe glass windows in the old turf hut were cleaned, and the boxes\r\nswept out.\r\n\r\nBut it was only the first days, the first week; after that she began\r\nto be less eager about the work. There was really no need to take all\r\nthat trouble about cowsheds and things; she could make better use of\r\nher time now. Inger had learned a deal among the town folk, and\r\nit would be a pity not to turn it to account. She took to her\r\nspinning-wheel and loom again--true enough, she was even quicker and\r\nneater than before--a trifle too quick--_hui_!--especially when Isak\r\nwas looking on; he couldn\'t make out how any one could learn to use\r\ntheir fingers that way--the fine long fingers she had to her big\r\nhands. But Inger had a way of dropping one piece of work to take up\r\nanother, all in a moment. Well, well, there were more things to be\r\nlooked to now than before, and maybe she was not altogether so patient\r\nas she had been; a trifle of unrest had managed to creep in.\r\n\r\nFirst of all there were the flowers she had brought with her--bulbs\r\nand cuttings; little lives these too, that must be thought of. The\r\nglass window was too small, the ledge too narrow to set flower-pots\r\non; and besides, she had no flower-pots. Isak must make some tiny\r\nboxes for begonias, fuchsias, and roses. Also, one window was not\r\nenough--fancy a room with only one window!\r\n\r\nAnd, "Oh, by the way," said Inger, "I want an iron, you know. There\r\nisn\'t one in the place. I could use a flat iron for pressing when I\'m\r\nsewing dresses and things, but you can\'t do proper work without an\r\niron of some sort."\r\n\r\nIsak promised to get the blacksmith down at the village to make a\r\nfirst-rate pressing-iron. Oh, Isak was ready to do anything, do all\r\nthat she asked in every way; for he could see well enough that Inger\r\nhad learned a heap of things now, and matchless clever she was grown.\r\nShe spoke, too, in a different way, a little finer, using elegant\r\nwords. She never shouted out to him now as she used to: "Come and get\r\nyour food!" but would say instead: "Dinner\'s ready, if you please."\r\nEverything was different now. In the old days he would answer simply\r\n"Ay," or say nothing at all, and go on working for a bit before he\r\ncame. Now, he said "Thanks," and went in at once. Love makes the wise\r\na fool: now and then Isak would say "Thanks, thanks." Ay, all was\r\ndifferent now--maybe a trifle too fine in some ways. When Isak spoke\r\nof dung, and was rough in his speech, as peasants are, Inger would\r\ncall it manure, "for the sake of the children, you know."\r\n\r\nShe was careful with the children, and taught them everything,\r\neducated them. Let tiny Leopoldine go on quickly with her crochet\r\nwork, and the boys with writing and schooling; they would not be\r\naltogether behindhand when the time came for them to go to school in\r\nthe village. Eleseus in particular was grown a clever one, but little\r\nSivert was nothing much, if the truth must be told--a madcap,\r\na jackanapes. He even ventured to screw a little at Mother\'s\r\nsewing-machine, and had already hacked off splinters from table and\r\nchairs with his new pocket-knife. Inger had threatened to take it away\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nThe children, of course, had all the animals about the place, and\r\nEleseus had still his coloured pencil besides. He used it very\r\ncarefully, and rarely lent it to his brother, but for all that the\r\nwalls were covered with blue and red drawings as time went on, and the\r\npencil got smaller and smaller. At last Eleseus was simply forced to\r\nput Sivert on rations with it, lending him the pencil on Sunday only,\r\nfor one drawing. Sivert was not pleased with the arrangement, but\r\nEleseus was a fellow who would stand no nonsense. Not so much as being\r\nthe stronger, but he had longer arms, and could manage better when it\r\ncame to a quarrel.\r\n\r\nBut that Sivert! Now and again he would come across a bird\'s nest in\r\nthe woods; once he talked about a mouse-hole he had found, and made a\r\nlot of that; another time it was a great fish as big as a man, he had\r\nseen in the river. But it was all evidently his own invention; he was\r\nsomewhat inclined to make black into white, was Sivert, but a good\r\nsort for all that. When the cat had kittens, it was he who brought her\r\nmilk, because she hissed too much for Eleseus. Sivert was never tired\r\nof standing looking at the box full of movement, a nest of tumbling\r\nfurry paws.\r\n\r\nThe chickens, too, he noticed every day: the cock with his lordly\r\ncarriage and fine feathers, the hens tripping about chattering low,\r\nand pecking at the sand, or screaming out as if terribly hurt every\r\ntime they had laid an egg.\r\n\r\nAnd there was the big wether. Little Sivert had read a good deal to\r\nwhat he knew before, but he could not say of the wether that the beast\r\nhad a fine Roman nose, begad! That he could not say. But he could do\r\nbetter than that. He knew the wether from the day when it had been\r\na lamb, he understood it and was one with it--a kinsman, a\r\nfellow-creature. Once, a strange primitive impression flickered\r\nthrough his senses: it was a moment he never forgot. The wether was\r\ngrazing quietly in the field; suddenly it threw up its head, stopped\r\nmunching, simply stood there looking out. Sivert looked involuntarily\r\nin the same direction. No--nothing remarkable. But Sivert himself felt\r\nsomething strange within him: "\'Tis most as if he stood looking into\r\nthe garden of Eden," he thought.\r\n\r\nThere were the cows,--the children had each a couple,--great sailing\r\ncreatures, so friendly and tame that they let themselves be caught\r\nwhenever you liked; let human children pat them. There was the pig,\r\nwhite and particular about its person when decently looked after,\r\nlistening to every sound, a comical fellow, always eager for food, and\r\nticklish and fidgety as a girl. And there was the billy-goat, there\r\nwas always one old billy-goat at Sellanraa, for as soon as one died\r\nanother was ready to take his place. And was there ever anything so\r\nsolemnly ridiculous to look at? Just now he had a whole lot of goats\r\nto look after, but at times he would get sick and tired of them all,\r\nand lie down, a bearded, thoughtful spectacle, a veritable Father\r\nAbraham. And then in a moment, up again and off after the flock. He\r\nalways left a trail of sourish air behind him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe daily round of the farm goes on. Now and again a traveller comes\r\nby, on his way up to the hills, and asks: "And how\'s all with ye\r\nhere?"\r\n\r\nAnd Isak answers: "Ay, thank ye kindly."\r\n\r\nIsak works and works, consulting the almanac for all that he does,\r\nnotes the changes of the moon, pays heed to the signs of the weather,\r\nand works on. He has beaten out so much of a track down to the village\r\nthat he can drive in now with horse and cart, but for the most part,\r\nhe carries his load himself; carries loads of cheese or hides, and\r\nbark and resin, and butter and eggs; all things he can sell, to bring\r\nback other wares instead. No, in the summer he does not often drive\r\ndown--for one thing, because the road down from Breidablik, the last\r\npart of the way, is so badly kept. He has asked Brede Olsen to help\r\nwith the upkeep of the road, and do his share. Brede Olsen promises,\r\nbut does not hold to his word. And Isak will not ask him again. Rather\r\ncarry a load on his back himself. And Inger says: "I can\'t understand\r\nhow you ever manage it all." Oh, but he could manage anything. He had\r\na pair of boots, so unimaginably heavy and thick, with great slabs of\r\niron on the soles, even the straps were fastened with copper nails--it\r\nwas a marvel that one man could walk in such boots at all.\r\n\r\nOn one of his journeys down, he came upon several gangs of men at work\r\non the moors; putting down stone sockets and fixing telegraph poles.\r\nSome of them are from the village, Brede Olsen is there too, for all\r\nthat he has taken up land of his own and ought to be working on that.\r\nIsak wonders that Brede can find time.\r\n\r\nThe foreman asks if Isak can sell them telegraph poles. Isak says no.\r\nNot if he\'s well paid for them?--No.--Oh, Isak was grown a thought\r\nquicker in his dealings now, he could say no. If he sold them a few\r\npoles, to be sure it would be money in his pockets, so many _Daler_\r\nmore; but he had no timber to spare, there was nothing gained by that.\r\nThe engineer in charge comes up himself to ask, but Isak refuses.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve poles enough," says the engineer, "but it would be easier to\r\ntake them from your ground up there, and save transport."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no timber to spare myself," says Isak. "I want to get up a bit\r\nof a saw and do some cutting; there\'s some more buildings I\'ll need to\r\nhave ready soon."\r\n\r\nHere Brede Olsen put in a word, and says: "If I was you, Isak, I\'d\r\nsell them poles."\r\n\r\nFor all his patience, Isak gave Brede a look and said: "Ay, I dare say\r\nyou would."\r\n\r\n"Well--what?" asks Brede.\r\n\r\n"Only that I\'m not you," said Isak.\r\n\r\nSome of the workmen chuckled a little at this.\r\n\r\nAy, Isak had reason enough just then to put his neighbour down; that\r\nvery day he had seen three sheep in the fields at Breidablik, and one\r\nof them he knew--the one with the flat ears that Oline had bartered\r\naway. He may keep it, thought Isak, as he went on his way; Brede and\r\nhis woman may get all the sheep they want, for me!\r\n\r\nThat business of the saw was always in his thoughts; it was as he had\r\nsaid. Last winter, when the roads were hard, he had carted up the big\r\ncircular blade and the fittings, ordered from Trondhjem through the\r\nvillage store. The parts were lying in one of the sheds now, well\r\nsmeared with oil to keep off the rust. He had brought up some of the\r\nbeams too, for the framework; he could begin building when he pleased,\r\nbut he put it off. What could it be? was he beginning to grow slack,\r\nwas he wearing out? He could not understand it himself. It would have\r\nbeen no surprise to others, perhaps, but Isak could not believe it.\r\nWas his head going? He had never been afraid of taking up a piece of\r\nwork before; he must have changed somehow, since the time when he had\r\nbuilt his mill across a river just as big. He could get in help from\r\nthe village, but he would try again alone; he would start in a day or\r\nso--and Inger could lend him a hand.\r\n\r\nHe spoke to Inger about it.\r\n\r\n"Hm. I don\'t know if you could find time one of these days to lend a\r\nhand with that sawmill?"\r\n\r\nInger thought for a moment. "Ye--s, if I can manage it. So you\'re\r\ngoing to set up a sawmill?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, \'tis my intention so. I\'ve worked it all out in my head."\r\n\r\n"Will that be harder than the mill was?"\r\n\r\n"Much harder, ten times as hard. Why, it\'s all got to be as close and\r\nexact--down to the tiniest line, and the saw itself exactly midways."\r\n\r\n"If only you can manage it," said Inger thoughtlessly.\r\n\r\nIsak was offended, and answered, "As to that, we shall see."\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t you get a man to help you, some one that knows the work?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, you won\'t be able to manage it," said she again.\r\n\r\nIsak put up his hand to his hair--it was like a bear lifting his paw.\r\n\r\n"\'Twas just that I\'ve been fearing," said he. "That I might not manage\r\nit. And that\'s why I wanted you that\'s learned so much to help me."\r\n\r\nThat was one to the bear. But nothing gained after all. Inger tossed\r\nher head and turned aside unkindly, and would have nothing to do with\r\nhis saw.\r\n\r\n"Well, then--" said Isak.\r\n\r\n"Why, do you want me to stand getting drenched in the river and have\r\nme laid up? And who\'s to do all the sewing, and look to the animals\r\nand keep house, and all the rest?"\r\n\r\n"No, that\'s true," said Isak.\r\n\r\nOh, but it was only the four corner posts and the middle ones for\r\nthe two long sides he wanted help with, that was all. Inger--was she\r\nreally grown so different in her heart through living among folk from\r\nthe towns?\r\n\r\nThe fact was that Inger had changed a good deal; she thought now less\r\nof their common good than of herself. She had taken loom and wheel\r\ninto use again, but the sewing machine was more to her taste; and when\r\nthe pressing-iron came up from the blacksmith\'s, she was ready to set\r\nup as a fully-trained dressmaker. She had a profession now. She began\r\nby making a couple of little frocks for Leopoldine. Isak thought them\r\npretty, and praised them, maybe, a thought too much; Inger hinted that\r\nit was nothing to what she could do when she tried.\r\n\r\n"But they\'re too short," said Isak.\r\n\r\n"They\'re worn that way in town," said Inger. "You know nothing about\r\nit."\r\n\r\nIsak saw he had gone too far, and, to make up for it, said something\r\nabout getting some material for Inger herself, for something or other.\r\n\r\n"For a cloak?" said Inger.\r\n\r\n"Ay, or what you\'d like."\r\n\r\nInger agreed to have something for a cloak, and described the sort of\r\nstuff she wanted.\r\n\r\nBut when she had made the cloak, she had to find some one to show it\r\nto; accordingly, when the boys went down to the village to be put to\r\nschool, Inger herself went with them. And that journey might have\r\nseemed a little thing, but it left its mark.\r\n\r\nThey came first of all to Breidablik, and the Breidablik woman and her\r\nchildren came out to see who it was going by. There sat Inger and the\r\ntwo boys, driving down lordly-wise--the boys on their way to school,\r\nnothing less, and Inger wearing a cloak. The Breidablik woman felt\r\na sting at the sight; the cloak she could have done without--thank\r\nheaven, _she_ set no store by such foolishness!--but ... she had\r\nchildren of her own--Barbro, a great girl already, Helge, the next,\r\nand Kathrine, all of an age for school. The two eldest had been to\r\nschool before, when they lived down in the village, but after moving\r\nup to Breidablik, to an out-of-the-way place up on the moors, they had\r\nbeen forced to give it up, and let the children run heathen again.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be wanting a bite for the boys, maybe," said the woman.\r\n\r\n"Food? Do you see this chest here? It\'s my travelling trunk, that I\r\nbrought home with me--I\'ve that full of food."\r\n\r\n"And what\'ll be in it of sorts?"\r\n\r\n"What sorts? I\'ve meat and pork in plenty, and bread and butter and\r\ncheese besides."\r\n\r\n"Ay, you\'ve no lack up at Sellanraa," said the other; and her poor,\r\nsallow-faced children listened with eyes and ears to this talk of rich\r\nthings to eat. "And where will they be staying?" asked the mother.\r\n\r\n"At the blacksmith\'s," said Inger.\r\n\r\n"Ho!" said the other. "Ay, mine\'ll be going to school again soon.\r\nThey\'ll stay with the Lensmand."\r\n\r\n"Ho!" said Inger.\r\n\r\n"Ay, or at the doctor\'s, maybe, or at the parsonage. Brede he\'s in\r\nwith the great folks there, of course."\r\n\r\nInger fumbled with her cloak, and managed to turn it so that a bit of\r\nblack silk fringe appeared to advantage.\r\n\r\n"Where did you get the cloak?" asked, the woman. "One you had with\r\nyou, maybe?"\r\n\r\n"I made it myself."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, \'tis as I said: wealth and riches full and running over...."\r\n\r\nInger drove on, feeling all set up and pleased with herself, and,\r\ncoming into the village, she may have been a trifle overproud in her\r\nbearing. Lensmand Heyerdahl\'s lady was not pleased at the sight of\r\nthat cloak; the Sellanraa woman was forgetting her place--forgetting\r\nwhere it was she had come from after five years\' absence. But Inger\r\nhad at least a chance of showing off her cloak, and the storekeeper\'s\r\nwife and the blacksmith\'s wife and the schoolmaster\'s wife all thought\r\nof getting one like it for themselves--but it could wait a bit.\r\n\r\nAnd now it was not long before Inger began to have visitors. One\r\nor two women came across from the other side of the hills, out of\r\ncuriosity. Oline had perhaps chanced to say something against her\r\nwill, to this one or that. Those who came now brought news from\r\nInger\'s own birthplace; what more natural than that Inger should give\r\nthem a cup of coffee, and let them look at her sewing-machine! Young\r\ngirls came up in pairs from the coast, from the village, to ask\r\nInger\'s advice; it was autumn now, and they had been saving up for a\r\nnew dress, and wanted her to help them. Inger, of course, would know\r\nall about the latest fashions, after being out in the world, and now\r\nand again she would do a little cutting out. Inger herself brightened\r\nup at these visits, and was glad; kindly and helpful she was too, and\r\nclever at the work, besides; she could cut out material without a\r\npattern. Sometimes she would even hem a whole length on her machine,\r\nand all for nothing, and give the stuff back to the girls with a\r\ndelightful jest: "There--now you can sew the buttons on yourself!"\r\n\r\nLater in the year Inger was sent for down to the village, to do\r\ndressmaking for some of the great folks there. Inger could not go; she\r\nhad a household to look after, and animals besides, all the work of\r\nthe home, and she had no servant.\r\n\r\nHad no what? Servant!\r\n\r\nShe spoke to Isak one day.\r\n\r\n"If only I had some one to help me, I could put in more time sewing."\r\n\r\nIsak did not understand. "Help?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, help in the house--a servant-girl."\r\n\r\nIsak must have been taken aback at this; he laughed a little in\r\nhis iron beard, and took it as a jest. "Ay, we should have a\r\nservant-girl," said he.\r\n\r\n"Housewives in the towns always have a servant," said Inger.\r\n\r\n"Ho!" said Isak.\r\n\r\nWell, Isak was not perhaps in the best of humour just then, not\r\nexactly gentle and content, no, for he had started work on that\r\nsawmill, and it was a slow and toilsome business; he couldn\'t hold the\r\nbaulks with one hand, and a level in the other, and fix ends at the\r\nsame time. But when the boys came back from school again it was\r\neasier; the lads were useful and a help, bless them! Sivert especially\r\nhad a genius for knocking in nails, but Eleseus was better at handling\r\na plumb-line. By the end of a week, Isak and the boys had actually got\r\nthe foundation posts in, and soundly fixed with stretcher pieces as\r\nthick as the beams themselves.\r\n\r\nIt worked out all right--everything worked out all right somehow. But\r\nIsak was beginning to feel tired in the evenings now--whatever\r\nit could be. It was not only building a sawmill and getting that\r\ndone--there was everything else besides. The hay was in, but the corn\r\nwas standing yet, soon it would have to be cut and stacked: there were\r\nthe potatoes too, they would have to be taken up before long. But the\r\nboys were a wonderful help. He did not thank them; \'twas not the way\r\namong folk of their sort, but he was mightily pleased with them for\r\nall that. Now and again they would sit down in the middle of their\r\nwork and talk together, the father almost asking his sons\' advice as\r\nto what they should do next. Those were proud moments for the lads,\r\nthey learned also to think well before they spoke, lest they should be\r\nin the wrong.\r\n\r\n"\'Twould be a pity not to have the saw roofed in before the autumn\r\nrains," said their father.\r\n\r\nIf only Inger had been as in the old days! But Inger was not so strong\r\nas she had been, it seemed, and that was natural enough after her long\r\nspell within walls. That her mind, too, seemed changed was another\r\nmatter. Strange, how little thought, how little care, she seemed to\r\ntake now; shallow and heedless--was this Inger?\r\n\r\nOne day she spoke of the child she had killed.\r\n\r\n"And a fool I was to do it," she said. "We might have had her mouth\r\nsewed up too, and then I needn\'t have throttled her." And she never\r\nstole off now to a tiny grave in the forest, where once she had patted\r\nthe earth with her hands and set up a little cross.\r\n\r\nBut Inger was not altogether heartless yet; she cared for her other\r\nchildren, kept them clean and made new clothes for them; she would sit\r\nup late at night mending their things. It was her ambition to see them\r\nget on in the world.\r\n\r\nThe corn was stacked, and the potatoes were taken up. Then came the\r\nwinter. No, the sawmill did not get roofed in that autumn, but that\r\ncould not be helped--after all, \'twas not a matter of life or death.\r\nNext summer would be time and means enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winter round of work was as before; carting wood, mending tools\r\nand implements. Inger kept house, and did sewing in her spare time.\r\nThe boys were down in the village again for the long term at school.\r\nFor several winters past they had had a pair of _ski_ between them;\r\nthey managed well enough that way as long as they were at home, one\r\nwaiting while the other took his turn, or one standing on behind the\r\nother. Ay, they managed finely with but one pair, it was the finest\r\nthing they knew, and they were innocent and glad. But down in the\r\nvillage things were different. The school was full of _ski_; even the\r\nchildren at Breidablik, it seemed, had each a pair. And the end of it\r\nwas that Isak had to make a new pair for Eleseus, Sivert keeping the\r\nold pair for his own.\r\n\r\nIsak did more; he had the boys well clad, and gave them everlasting\r\nboots. But when that was done, Isak went to the storekeeper and asked\r\nfor a ring.\r\n\r\n"A ring?" said the man.\r\n\r\n"A finger ring. Ay, I\'ve grown that high and mighty now I must give my\r\nwife a ring."\r\n\r\n"Do you want a silver one, or gold, or just a brass ring dipped to\r\nlook like gold?"\r\n\r\n"Let\'s say a silver ring."\r\n\r\nThe storekeeper thought for a while.\r\n\r\n"Look you, Isak," he said. "If you want to do the proper thing, and\r\ngive your wife a ring she needn\'t be ashamed to wear, you\'d better\r\nmake it a gold ring."\r\n\r\n"What!" said Isak aloud. Though maybe in his inmost heart he had been\r\nthinking of a gold ring all the time.\r\n\r\nThey talked the matter over seriously, and agreed about getting a\r\nmeasurement of some sort for the ring. Isak was thoughtful, and shook\r\nhis head and reckoned it was a big thing to do, but the storekeeper\r\nrefused to order anything but a gold ring. Isak went home again,\r\nsecretly pleased with his decision, but somewhat anxious, for all\r\nthat, at the extravagant lengths he had gone to, all for being in love\r\nwith his wife.\r\n\r\nThere was a good average snowfall that winter, and early in the year,\r\nwhen the roads were passable, folk from the village began carting\r\nup telegraph poles over the moors, dropping their loads at regular\r\nintervals. They drove big teams, and came up past Breidablik, past\r\nSellanraa farm, and met new teams beyond, coming down with poles from\r\nthe other side of the hills--the line was complete.\r\n\r\nSo life went on day by day, without any great event. What was there\r\nto happen, anyway? Spring came, and the work of setting up the poles\r\nbegan. Brede Olsen was there again, with the gangs, though he should\r\nhave been working on his own land at that season. "\'Tis a wonder he\'s\r\nthe time," thought Isak.\r\n\r\nIsak himself had barely time to eat and sleep; it was a close thing to\r\nget through the season\'s work now, with all the land he had brought\r\nunder tillage.\r\n\r\nThen, between seasons, he got his sawmill roofed in, and could set to\r\nwork putting up the machine parts. And look you, \'twas no marvel of\r\nfine woodwork he had set up, but strong it was, as a giant of the\r\nhills, and stood there to good use. The saw could work, and cut as a\r\nsawmill should; Isak had kept his eyes about him down in the village,\r\nand used them well. It was hearty and small, this sawmill he had\r\nbuilt, but he was pleased with it; he carved the date above the\r\ndoorway, and put his mark.\r\n\r\nAnd that summer, something more than usual did come about after all at\r\nSellanraa.\r\n\r\nThe telegraph workers had now reached so far up over the moors that\r\nthe foremost gang came to the farm one evening and asked to be lodged\r\nfor the night. They were given shelter in the big barn. As the days\r\nwent on, the other gangs came along, and all were housed at Sellanraa.\r\nThe work went on ahead, passing the farm, but the men still came\r\nback to sleep in the barn. One Saturday evening came the engineer in\r\ncharge, to pay the men.\r\n\r\nAt sight of the engineer, Eleseus felt his heart jump, and stole out\r\nof the house lest he should be asked about that coloured pencil. Oh,\r\nthere would be trouble now--and Sivert nowhere to be seen; he would\r\nhave to face it alone. Eleseus slipped round the corner of the house,\r\nlike a pale ghost, found his mother, and begged her to tell Sivert to\r\ncome. There was no help for it now.\r\n\r\nSivert took the matter less to heart--but then, he was not the chief\r\nculprit. The two brothers went a little way off and sat down, and\r\nEleseus said: "If you\'d say it was you, now!"\r\n\r\n"Me?" said Sivert.\r\n\r\n"You\'re younger, he wouldn\'t do anything to you."\r\n\r\nSivert thought over it, and saw that his brother was in distress; also\r\nit flattered him to feel that the other needed his help.\r\n\r\n"Why, I might help you out of it, perhaps," said he in a grown-up\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"Ay, if you would!" said Eleseus, and quite simply gave his brother\r\nthe bit of pencil that was left. "You can have it for keeps," he said.\r\n\r\nThey were going in again together, but Eleseus recollected he had\r\nsomething he must do over at the sawmill, or rather, at the cornmill;\r\nsomething he must look to, and it would take some time--he wouldn\'t be\r\nfinished just yet. Sivert went in alone.\r\n\r\nThere sat the engineer, paying out notes and silver, and when he had\r\nfinished, Inger gave him milk to drink, a jug and a glass, and he\r\nthanked her. Then he talked to little Leopoldine, and then, noticing\r\nthe drawings on the walls, asked straight out who had done that. "Was\r\nit you?" he asked, turning to Sivert. The man felt, perhaps, he owed\r\nsomething for Inger\'s hospitality, and praised the drawings just to\r\nplease her. Inger, on her part, explained the matter as it was: it was\r\nher boys had made the drawings--both of them. They had no paper till\r\nshe came home and looked to things, so they had marked all about the\r\nwalls. But she hadn\'t the heart to wash it off again.\r\n\r\n"Why, leave it as it is," said the engineer. "Paper, did you say?" And\r\nhe took out a heap of big sheets. "There, draw away on that till I\r\ncome round again. And how are you off for pencils?"\r\n\r\nSivert stepped forward simply with the stump he had, and showed how\r\nsmall it was. And behold, the man gave him a new coloured pencil, not\r\neven sharpened. "There, now you can start afresh. But I\'d make the\r\nhorses red if I were you, and do the goats with blue. Never seen a\r\nblue horse, have you?"\r\n\r\nAnd the engineer went on his way.\r\n\r\nThat same evening, a man came up from the village with a basket--he\r\nhanded out some bottles to the workmen, and went off again. But after\r\nhe had gone, it was no longer so quiet about the place; some one\r\nplayed an accordion, the men talked loudly, and there was singing, and\r\neven dancing, at Sellanraa. One of the men asked Inger out to dance,\r\nand Inger--who would have thought it of her?--she laughed a little\r\nlaugh and actually danced a few turns round. After that, some of the\r\nothers asked her, and she danced not a little in the end.\r\n\r\nInger--who could say what was in her mind? Here she was dancing gaily,\r\nmaybe for the first time in her life; sought after, riotously pursued\r\nby thirty men, and she alone, the only one to choose from, no one to\r\ncut her out. And those burly telegraph men--how they lifted her! Why\r\nnot dance? Eleseus and Sivert were fast asleep in the little chamber,\r\nundisturbed by all the noise outside; little Leopoldine was up,\r\nlooking on wonderingly at her mother as she danced.\r\n\r\nIsak was out in the fields all the time; he had gone off directly\r\nafter supper, and when he came home to go to bed, some one offered\r\nhim a bottle. He drank a little, and sat watching the dancing, with\r\nLeopoldine on his lap.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis a gay time you\'re having," said he kindly to Inger--"footing it\r\nproperly tonight!"\r\n\r\nAfter a while, the music stopped, and the dance was over. The workmen\r\ngot ready to leave--they were going down to the village for the rest\r\nof the evening, and would be there all next day, coming back on Monday\r\nmorning. Soon all was quiet again at Sellanraa; a couple of the older\r\nmen stayed behind, and turned in to sleep in the barn.\r\n\r\nIsak woke up in the night--Inger was not there. Could she be gone to\r\nsee to the cows? He got up and went across to the cowshed. "Inger!" he\r\ncalled. No answer. The cows turned their heads and looked at him; all\r\nwas still. Unthinkingly, from ancient habit, he counted heads, counted\r\nthe sheep also; there was one of the ewes had a bad habit of staying\r\nout at night--and out it was now, "Inger!" he called again. Still no\r\nanswer. Surely she couldn\'t have gone with them down to the village?\r\n\r\nThe summer night was light and warm. Isak stayed a while sitting on\r\nthe door-slab, then he went out into the woods to look for the ewe.\r\nAnd he found Inger. Inger and one other. They sat in the heather, she\r\ntwirling his peaked cap on one finger, both talking together--they\r\nwere after her again, it seemed.\r\n\r\nIsak trundled slowly over towards them. Inger turned and saw him, and\r\nbowed forward where she sat; all the life went out of her, she hung\r\nlike a rag.\r\n\r\n"H\'m. Did you know that ewe\'s out again?" asked Isak. "But no, you\r\nwouldn\'t know," said he.\r\n\r\nThe young telegraph hand picked up his cap and began sidling away.\r\n"I\'ll be getting along after the others," he said. "Good-night to ye."\r\nNo one answered.\r\n\r\n"So you\'re sitting here," said Isak. "Going to stay out a bit, maybe?"\r\nAnd he turned towards home. Inger rose to her knees, got on her feet\r\nand followed after, and so they went, man in front and wife behind,\r\ntandem-wise. They went home.\r\n\r\nInger must have found time to think. Oh, she found a way. "\'Twas the\r\newe I was after," said she. "I saw it was out again. Then one of the\r\nmen came up and helped me look. We\'d not been sitting a moment when\r\nyou came. Where are you going now?"\r\n\r\n"I? Seems I\'d better look for the creature myself."\r\n\r\n"No, no, go and lie down. If any one\'s to go, let me. Go and lie down,\r\nyou\'ll be needing rest. And as for that, the ewe can stay out where\r\nshe is--\'twon\'t be the first time."\r\n\r\n"And be eaten up by some beast or other," said Isak, and went off.\r\n\r\nInger ran after him. "Don\'t, don\'t, it\'s not worth it," she said. "You\r\nneed rest. Let me go."\r\n\r\nIsak gave in. But he would not hear of Inger going out to search by\r\nherself. And they went indoors together.\r\n\r\nInger turned at once to look for the children; went into the little\r\nchamber to see to the boys, as if she had been out on some perfectly\r\nnatural errand; it almost seemed, indeed, as if she were trying to\r\nmake up to Isak--as if she expected him to be more in love with her\r\nthan ever that evening--after she had explained it all so neatly.\r\nBut no, Isak was not so easy to turn; he would rather have seen her\r\nthoroughly distressed and beside herself with contrition. Ay, that\r\nwould have been better. What matter that she had collapsed for\r\na moment when he came on her in the woods; the little moment of\r\nshame--what was the good of that when it all passed off so soon?\r\n\r\nHe was far from gentle, too, the next day, and that a Sunday; went off\r\nand looked to the sawmill, looked to the cornmill, looked over the\r\nfields, with the children or by himself. Inger tried once to join him,\r\nbut Isak turned away: "I\'m going up to the river," he said. "Something\r\nup there...."\r\n\r\nThere was trouble in his mind, like enough, but he bore it silently,\r\nand made no scene. Oh, there was something great about Isak; as it\r\nmight be Israel, promised and ever deceived, but still believing.\r\n\r\nBy Monday the tension was less marked, and as the days went on, the\r\nimpression of that unhappy Saturday evening grew fainter. Time can\r\nmend a deal of things; a spit and a shake, a meal and a good night\'s\r\nrest, and it will heal the sorriest of wounds. Isak\'s trouble was not\r\nso bad as it might have been; after all, he was not certain that he\r\nhad been wronged, and apart from that, he had other things to think\r\nof; the harvesting was at hand. And last, not least, the telegraph\r\nline was all but finished now; in a little while they would be left in\r\npeace. A broad light road, a king\'s highway, had been cut through the\r\ndark of the forest; there were poles and wires running right up over\r\nthe hills.\r\n\r\nNext Saturday paytime, the last there was to be, Isak managed to be\r\naway from home--he wished it so. He went down into the village with\r\ncheese and butter, and came back on Sunday night. The men were all\r\ngone from the barn; nearly all, that is; the last man stumbled out of\r\nthe yard with his pack on his shoulder--all but the last, that is.\r\nThat it was not altogether safe as yet Isak could see, for there was a\r\nbundle left on the floor of the barn. Where the owner was he could not\r\nsay, and did not care to know, but there was a peaked cap on top of\r\nthe bundle--an offence to the eye.\r\n\r\nIsak heaved the bundle out into the yard, flung the cap out after\r\nit, and closed the door. Then he went into the stable and looked out\r\nthrough the window. And thought, belike: "Let the bundle stay there,\r\nand let the cap lie there, \'tis all one whose they may be. A bit of\r\ndirt he is, and not worth my while"--so he might have thought. But\r\nwhen the fellow comes for his bundle, never doubt but that Isak will\r\nbe there to take him by the arm and make that arm a trifle blue. And\r\nas for kicking him off the place in a way he\'d remember--why, Isak\r\nwould give him that too!\r\n\r\nWhereupon Isak left his window in the stable and went back to the\r\ncowshed and looked out from there, and could not rest. The bundle was\r\ntied up with string; the poor fellow had no lock to his bag, and the\r\nstring had come undone--Isak could not feel sure he had not dealt over\r\nhardly with that bundle. Whatever it might be--he was not sure he had\r\nacted rightly. Only just now he had been in the village, and seen\r\nhis new harrow, a brand-new harrow he had ordered--oh, a wonderful\r\nmachine, an idol to worship, and it had just come. A thing like that\r\nmust carry a blessing with it. And the powers above, that guide the\r\nfootsteps of men, might be watching him now at this moment, to see if\r\nhe deserved a blessing or not. Isak gave much thought to the\r\npowers above; ay, he had seen God with his own eyes, one night in\r\nharvest-time, in the woods; it was rather a curious sight.\r\n\r\nIsak went out into the yard and stood over the bundle. He was still in\r\ndoubt; he thrust his hat back and scratched his head, which gave him\r\na devil-may-care appearance for the moment; something lordly and\r\ncareless, as it might have been a Spaniard. But then he must have\r\nthought something like this: "Nay, here am I, and far from being in\r\nany way splendid or excellent; a very dog." And then he tied up the\r\nbundle neatly once more, picked up the cap, and carried all back into\r\nthe barn again. And that was done.\r\n\r\nAs he went out from the barn and over to the mill, away from the yard,\r\naway from everything, there was no Inger to be seen in the window of\r\nthe house. Nay, then, let her be where she pleased--no doubt she was\r\nin bed--where else should she be? But in the old days, in those first\r\ninnocent years, Inger could never rest, but sat up at nights waiting\r\nfor him when he had been down to the village. It was different now,\r\ndifferent in every way. As, for instance, when he had given her that\r\nring. Could anything have been more utterly a failure? Isak had been\r\ngloriously modest, and far from venturing to call it a gold ring.\r\n"\'Tis nothing grand, but you might put it on your finger just to try."\r\n\r\n"Is it gold?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Ay, but \'tis none so thick," said he.\r\n\r\nAnd here she was to have answered: "Ay, but indeed it is." But instead\r\nshe had said: "No, \'tis not very thick, but still...."\r\n\r\n"Nay, \'tis worth no more than a bit of grass, belike," said he at\r\nlast, and gave up hope.\r\n\r\nBut Inger had indeed been glad of the ring, and wore it on her right\r\nhand, looking fine there when she was sewing; now and again she would\r\nlet the village girls try it on, and sit with it on their finger for\r\na bit when they came up to ask of this or that. Foolish Isak--not to\r\nunderstand that she was proud of it beyond measure!...\r\n\r\nIt was a profitless business sitting there alone in the mill,\r\nlistening to the fall the whole night through. Isak had done no wrong;\r\nhe had no cause to hide himself away. He left the mill, went up over\r\nthe fields, and home--into the house.\r\n\r\nAnd then in truth it was a shamefaced Isak, shamefaced and glad.\r\nBrede Olsen sat there, his neighbour and no other; sat there drinking\r\ncoffee. Ay, Inger was up, the two of them sat there simply and\r\nquietly, talking and drinking coffee.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s Isak," said Inger pleasantly as could be, and got up and\r\npoured out a cup for him. "Evening," said Brede, and was just as\r\npleasant too.\r\n\r\nIsak could see that Brede had been spending the evening with the\r\ntelegraph gangs, the last night before they went; he was somewhat the\r\nworse for it, maybe, but friendly and good-humoured enough. He boasted\r\na little, as was his way: hadn\'t the time really to bother with this\r\ntelegraphic work, the farm took all of a man\'s day--but he couldn\'t\r\nvery well say no when the engineer was so anxious to have him. And so\r\nit had come about, too, that Brede had had to take over the job of\r\nline inspector. Not for the sake of the money, of course, he could\r\nearn many times that down in the village, but he hadn\'t liked to\r\nrefuse. And they\'d given him a neat little machine set up on the wall,\r\na curious little thing, a sort of telegraph in itself.\r\n\r\nAy, Brede was a wastrel and a boaster, but for all that Isak could\r\nbear him no grudge; he himself was too relieved at finding his\r\nneighbour in the house that evening instead of a stranger. Isak\r\nhad the peasant\'s coolness of mind, his few feelings, stability,\r\nstubbornness; he chatted with Brede and nodded at his shallowness.\r\n"Another cup for Brede," said he. And Inger poured it out.\r\n\r\nInger talked of the engineer; a kindly man he was beyond measure; had\r\nlooked at the boys\' drawings and writings, and even said something\r\nabout taking Eleseus to work under him.\r\n\r\n"To work with him?" said Isak.\r\n\r\n"Ay, to the town. To do writing and things, be a clerk in the\r\noffice--all for he was so pleased with the boy\'s writing and drawing."\r\n\r\n"Ho!" said Isak.\r\n\r\n"Well, and what do you say? He was going to have him confirmed too.\r\nThat was a great thing, to my mind."\r\n\r\n"Ay, a great thing indeed," said Brede. "And when the engineer says\r\nhe\'ll do a thing, he\'ll do it. I know him, and you can take my word\r\nfor that."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve no Eleseus to spare on this farm as I know of," said Isak.\r\n\r\nThere was something like a painful silence after that. Isak was not an\r\neasy man to talk to.\r\n\r\n"But when the boy himself wants to get on," said Inger at last, "and\r\nhas it in him, too." Silence again.\r\n\r\nThen said Brede with a laugh: "I wish he\'d ask for one of mine,\r\nanyway. I\'ve enough of them and to spare. But Barbro\'s the eldest, and\r\nshe\'s a girl."\r\n\r\n"And a good girl enough," said Inger, for politeness\' sake.\r\n\r\n"Ay, I\'ll not say no," said Brede. "Barbro\'s well enough, and clever\r\nat this and that--she\'s going to help at the Lensmand\'s now."\r\n\r\n"Going to the Lensmand\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I had to let her go--his wife was so set on it, I couldn\'t say\r\nno."\r\n\r\nIt was well on towards morning now, and Brede rose to go.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve a bundle and a cap I left in your barn," he said. "That is if\r\nthe men haven\'t run off with it," he added jestingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd time went on.\r\n\r\nYes, Eleseus was sent to town after all; Inger managed that. He was\r\nthere for a year, then he was confirmed, and after that had a regular\r\nplace in the engineer\'s office, and grew more and more clever at\r\nwriting and things. To see the letters he sent home--sometimes with\r\nred and black ink, like pictures almost. And the talk of them, the\r\nwords he used. Now and again he asked for money, something towards his\r\nexpenses. A watch and chain, for instance, he must have, so as not to\r\noversleep himself in the morning and be late at the office; money for\r\na pipe and tobacco also, such as the other young clerks in the town\r\nalways had. And for something he called pocket-money, and something he\r\ncalled evening classes, where he learned drawing and gymnastics and\r\nother matters proper to his rank and position. Altogether, it was no\r\nlight matter to keep Eleseus going in a berth in town.\r\n\r\n"Pocket-money?" said Isak. "Is that money to keep in your pocket,\r\nmaybe?"\r\n\r\n"That must be it, no doubt," said Inger. "So as not to be altogether\r\nwithout. And it\'s not much; only a _Daler_ now and then."\r\n\r\n"Ay, that\'s just it," said Isak harshly. "A _Daler_ now and a _Daler_\r\nthen...." But his harshness was all because he missed Eleseus himself,\r\nand wanted him home. "It makes too many _Dalers_ in the long run,"\r\nsaid he. "I can\'t keep, on like this; you must write and tell him he\r\ncan have no more."\r\n\r\n"Ho, very well then!" said Inger in an offended tone.\r\n\r\n"There\'s Sivert--what does he get by way of pocket-money?"\r\n\r\nInger answered: "You\'ve never been in a town, and so you don\'t know\r\nthese things. Sivert\'s no need of pocket-money. And talking of money,\r\nSivert ought to be none so badly off when his Uncle Sivert dies."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Ay, but I do know."\r\n\r\nAnd this was right enough in a way; Uncle Sivert had said something\r\nabout making little Sivert his heir. Uncle Sivert had heard of Eleseus\r\nand his grand doings in town, and the story did not please him; he\r\nnodded and bit his lips, and muttered that a nephew called up as his\r\nnamesake--named after Uncle Sivert--should not come to want. But what\r\nwas this fortune Uncle Sivert was supposed to possess? Had he really,\r\nbesides his neglected farm and his fishery, the heap of money and\r\nmeans folk generally thought? No one could say for certain. And apart\r\nfrom that, Uncle Sivert himself was an obstinate man; he insisted that\r\nlittle Sivert should come to stay with him. It was a point of honour\r\nwith him, this last; he should take little Sivert and look after him,\r\nas the engineer had done with Eleseus.\r\n\r\nBut how could it be done? Send little Sivert away from home?--it was\r\nout of the question. He was all the help left to Isak now. Moreover,\r\nthe lad himself had no great wish to go and stay with his famous\r\nuncle; he had tried it once, but had come home again. He was\r\nconfirmed, shot up in stature, and grew; the down showed on his cheek,\r\nhis hands were big, a pair of willing slaves. And he worked like a\r\nman.\r\n\r\nIsak could hardly have managed to get the new barn built at all\r\nwithout Sivert\'s help--but there it stood now, with bridge-way and\r\nair-holes and all, as big as they had at the parsonage itself. True,\r\nit was only a half-timbered building covered with boarding, but extra\r\nstout built, with iron clinches at the corners, and covered with\r\none-inch plank from Isak\'s own sawmill. And Sivert had hammered in\r\nmore than one nail at the work, and lifted the heavy beams for the\r\nframework till he was near fainting. Sivert got on well with his\r\nfather, and worked steadily at his side; he was made of the same\r\nstuff. And yet he was not above such simple ways as going up the\r\nhillside for tansy to rub with so as to smell nice in church. \'Twas\r\nLeopoldine was the one for getting fancies in her head, which was\r\nnatural enough, she being a girl, and the only daughter. That summer,\r\nif you please, she had discovered that she could not eat her porridge\r\nat supper without treacle--simply couldn\'t. And she was no great use\r\nat any kind of work either.\r\n\r\nInger had not yet given up her idea of keeping a servant; she\r\nbrought up the question every spring, and every time Isak opposed it\r\nstubbornly. All the cutting out and sewing and fine weaving she could\r\ndo, not to speak of making embroidered slippers, if she had but the\r\ntime to herself! And of late, Isak had been something less firm in his\r\nrefusal, though he grumbled still. Ho, the first time! He had made a\r\nwhole long speech about it; not as a matter of right and reason, nor\r\nyet from pride, but, alas! from weakness, from anger at the idea. But\r\nnow, he seemed to be giving way, as if ashamed.\r\n\r\n"If ever I\'m to have help in the house, now\'s the time," said Inger.\r\n"A few years more, and Leopoldine\'ll be big enough to do this and\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"Help?" said Isak. "What do you want help with, anyway?"\r\n\r\n"Want with it, indeed? Haven\'t you help yourself? Haven\'t you Sivert\r\nall the time?"\r\n\r\nWhat could Isak say to a meaningless argument like that? He answered:\r\n"Ay, well; when you get a girl up here, I doubt you\'ll be able to\r\nplough and sow and reap and manage all by yourselves. And then Sivert\r\nand I can go our ways."\r\n\r\n"That\'s as may be," said Inger. "But I\'ll just say this: that I could\r\nget Barbro to come now; she\'s written home about it."\r\n\r\n"What Barbro?" said Isak. "Is it that Brede\'s girl you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. She\'s in Bergen now."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll not have that Brede\'s girl Barbro up here," said he. "Whoever\r\nyou get, I\'ll have none of her."\r\n\r\nThat was better than nothing; Isak refused to have Barbro; he no\r\nlonger said they would have no servant at all.\r\n\r\nBarbro from Breidablik was not the sort of girl Isak approved of;\r\nshe was shallow and unsettled like her father--maybe like her mother\r\ntoo--a careless creature, no steady character at all. She had not\r\nstayed long at the Lensmand\'s; only a year. After her confirmation,\r\nshe went to help at the storekeeper\'s, and was there another year.\r\nHere she turned pious and got religion, and when the Salvation Army\r\ncame to the village she joined it, and went about with a red band on\r\nher sleeve and carried a guitar. She went to Bergen in that costume,\r\non the storekeeper\'s boat--that was last year. And she had just sent\r\nhome a photograph of herself to her people at Breidablik. Isak had\r\nseen it; a strange young lady with her hair curled up and a long\r\nwatch-chain hanging down over her breast. Her parents were proud of\r\nlittle Barbro, and showed the photograph about to all who came; \'twas\r\ngrand to see how she had learned town ways and got on in the world. As\r\nfor the red band and the guitar, she had given them up, it seemed.\r\n\r\n"I took the picture along and showed it to the Lensmand\'s lady," said\r\nBrede. "She didn\'t know her again."\r\n\r\n"Is she going to stay in Bergen?" said Isak suspiciously.\r\n\r\n"Why, unless she goes on to Christiania, perhaps," said Brede. "What\'s\r\nthere for her to do here? She\'s got a new place now, as housekeeper,\r\nfor two young clerks. They\'ve no wives nor womenfolk of their own, and\r\nthey pay her well."\r\n\r\n"How much?" said Isak.\r\n\r\n"She doesn\'t say exactly in the letter. But it must be something\r\naltogether different from what folk pay down here, that\'s plain. Why,\r\nshe gets Christmas presents, and presents other times as well, and not\r\ncounted off her wages at all."\r\n\r\n"Ho!" said Isak.\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t like to have her up at your place?" asked Brede.\r\n\r\n"I?" said Isak, all taken aback.\r\n\r\n"No, of course, he he! It was only a way of speaking. Barbro\'s well\r\nenough where she is. What was I going to say? You didn\'t notice\r\nanything wrong with the line coming down--the telegraph, what?"\r\n\r\n"With the telegraph? No."\r\n\r\n"No, no ... There\'s not much wrong with it now since I took over.\r\nAnd then I\'ve my own machine here on the wall to give a warning if\r\nanything happens. I\'ll have to take a walk up along the line one of\r\nthese days and see how things are. I\'ve too much to manage and look\r\nafter, \'tis more than one man\'s work. But as long as I\'m Inspector\r\nhere, and hold an official position, of course I can\'t neglect my\r\nduties. If I hadn\'t the telegraph, of course ... and it may not be for\r\nlong...."\r\n\r\n"Why?" said Isak. "You thinking of giving it up, maybe?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I can\'t say exactly," said Brede. "I haven\'t quite decided.\r\nThey want me to move down into the village again."\r\n\r\n"Who is it wants you?" asked Isak.\r\n\r\n"Oh, all of them. The Lensmand wants me to go and be assistant there\r\nagain, and the doctor wants me to drive for him, and the parson\'s wife\r\nsaid more than once she misses me to lend a hand, if it wasn\'t such a\r\nlong way to go. How was it with that strip of hill, Isak--the bit you\r\nsold? Did you get as much for it as they say?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, \'tis no lie," answered Isak.\r\n\r\n"But what did Geissler want with it, anyway? It lies there\r\nstill--curious thing! Year after year and nothing done."\r\n\r\nIt was a curious thing; Isak had often wondered about it himself; he\r\nhad spoken to the Lensmand about it, and asked for Geissler\'s address,\r\nthinking to write to him ... Ay, it was a mystery.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis more than I can say," said Isak.\r\n\r\nBrede made no secret of his interest in this matter of the sale. "They\r\nsay there\'s more of the same sort up there," he said, "besides yours.\r\nMaybe there\'s more in it than we know. \'Tis a pity that we should sit\r\nhere like dumb beasts and know nothing of it all. I\'ve thought of\r\ngoing up one day myself to have a look."\r\n\r\n"But do you know anything about metals and such-like?" asked Isak.\r\n\r\n"Why, I know a bit. And I\'ve asked one or two others. Anyhow, I\'ll\r\nhave to find something; I can\'t live and keep us all here on this bit\r\nof a farm. It\'s sheer impossible. \'Twas another matter with you that\'s\r\ngot all that timber and good soil below. \'Tis naught but moorland\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"Moorland\'s good soil enough," said Isak shortly. "I\'ve the same\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"But there\'s no draining it," said Brede.... "It can\'t be done."\r\n\r\nBut it could be done. Coming down the road that day Isak noticed other\r\nclearings; two of them were lower down, nearer the village, but there\r\nwas one far up above, between Breidablik and Sellanraa--ay, men were\r\nbeginning to work on the land now; in the old days when Isak first\r\ncame up, it had lain waste all of it. And these three new settlers\r\nwere folks from another district; men with some sense in their heads,\r\nby the look of things. They didn\'t begin by borrowing money to build\r\na house; no, they came up one year and did their spade work and went\r\naway again; vanished as if they were dead. That was the proper way;\r\nditching first, then plough and sow. Axel Stroem was nearest to Isak\'s\r\nland now, his next-door neighbour. A clever fellow, unmarried, he came\r\nfrom Helgeland. He had borrowed Isak\'s new harrow to break up his\r\nsoil, and not till the second year had he set up a hayshed and a turf\r\nhut for himself and a couple of animals. He had called his place\r\nMaaneland, because it looked nice in the moonlight. He had no\r\nwomenfolk himself, and found it difficult to get help in the summer,\r\nlying so far out, but he managed things the right way, no doubt about\r\nthat. Not as Brede Olsen did, building a house first, and then coming\r\nup with a big family and little ones and all, with neither soil nor\r\nstock to feed them. What did Brede Olsen know of draining moorland and\r\nbreaking new soil?\r\n\r\nHe knew how to waste his time idling, did Brede. He came by Sellanraa\r\none day, going up to the hills--simply to look for precious metals. He\r\ncame back the same evening; had not found anything definite, he said,\r\nbut certain signs--and he nodded. He would come up again soon, and go\r\nover the hills thoroughly, over towards Sweden.\r\n\r\nAnd sure enough, Brede came up again. He had taken a fancy to the\r\nwork, no doubt; but he called it telegraph business this time--must\r\ngo up and look over the whole of the line. Meanwhile his wife and\r\nchildren at home looked after the farm, or left it to look after\r\nitself. Isak was sick and tired of Brede\'s visits, and went out of the\r\nroom when he came; then Inger and Brede would sit talking heartily\r\ntogether. What could they have to talk about? Brede often went down to\r\nthe village, and had always some news to tell of the great folk there;\r\nInger, on the other hand, could always draw upon her famous journey to\r\nTrondhjem and her stay there. She had grown talkative in the years she\r\nhad been away, and was always ready to gossip with any one. No, she\r\nwas no longer the same straightforward, simple Inger of the old days.\r\n\r\nGirls and women came up continually to Sellanraa to have a piece of\r\nwork cut out, or a long hem put through the machine in a moment, and\r\nInger entertained them well. Oline too came again, couldn\'t help it,\r\nbelike; came both spring and autumn; fair-spoken, soft as butter, and\r\nthoroughly false. "Just looked along to see how things are with you,"\r\nshe said each time. "And I\'ve been longing so for a sight of the lads,\r\nI\'m that fond of them, the little angels they were. Ay, they\'re big\r\nfellows now, but it\'s strange ... I can\'t forget the time when they\r\nwere small and I had them in my care. And here\'s you building and\r\nbuilding again, and making a whole town of the place. Going to have\r\na bell to ring, maybe, at the roof of the barn, same as at the\r\nparsonage?"\r\n\r\nOnce Oline came and brought another woman with her, and the pair of\r\nthem and Inger had a nice day together. The more Inger had sitting\r\nround her, the better she worked at her sewing and cutting out, making\r\na show of it, waving her scissors and swinging the iron. It reminded\r\nher of the place where she had learned it all--there was always many\r\nof them in the workrooms there. Inger made no secret of where she had\r\ngot her knowledge and all her art from; it was from Trondhjem. It\r\nalmost appeared as if she had not been in prison at all, in the\r\nordinary way, but at school, in an institute, where one could learn to\r\nsew and weave and write, and do dressing and dyeing--all that she had\r\nlearned in Trondhjem. She spoke of the place as of a home; there were\r\nso many people she knew there, superintendents and forewomen and\r\nattendants, it had been dull and empty to come back here again, and\r\nhard to find herself altogether cut off from the life and society\r\nshe had been accustomed to. She even made some show of having a\r\ncold--couldn\'t stand the keen air there; for years after her return\r\nshe had been too poorly to work out of doors in all seasons. It was\r\nfor the outside work she really ought to have a servant.\r\n\r\n"Ay, Heaven save us," said Oline, "and why shouldn\'t you have a\r\nservant indeed, when you\'ve means and learning and a great fine house\r\nand all!"\r\n\r\nIt was pleasant to meet with sympathy, and Inger did not deny it. She\r\nworked away at her machine till the place shook, and the ring on her\r\nfinger shone.\r\n\r\n"There, you can see for yourself," said Oline to the woman with her.\r\n"It\'s true what I said, Inger she wears a gold ring on her finger."\r\n\r\n"Would you like to see it?" asked Inger, taking it off.\r\n\r\nOline seemed still to have her doubts; she turned it in her fingers\r\nas a monkey with a nut, looked at the mark. "Ay, \'tis as I say; Inger\r\nwith all her means and riches."\r\n\r\nThe other woman took the ring with veneration, and smiled humbly. "You\r\ncan put it on for a bit if you like," said Inger. "Don\'t be afraid, it\r\nwon\'t break."\r\n\r\nAnd Inger was amiable and kind. She told them about the cathedral at\r\nTrondhjem, and began like this: "You haven\'t seen the cathedral at\r\nTrondhjem, maybe? No, you haven\'t been there!" And it might have been\r\nher own cathedral, from the way she praised it, boasted of it, told\r\nthem height and breadth; it was a marvel! Seven priests could stand\r\nthere preaching all at once and never hear one another. "And then I\r\nsuppose you\'ve never seen St. Olaf\'s Well? Right in the middle of the\r\ncathedral itself, it is, on one side, and it\'s a bottomless well. When\r\nwe went there, we took each a little stone with us, and dropped it in,\r\nbut it never reached the bottom."\r\n\r\n"Never reached the bottom?" whispered the two women, shaking their\r\nheads.\r\n\r\n"And there\'s a thousand other things besides in that cathedral,"\r\nexclaimed Inger delightedly. "There\'s the silver chest to begin with.\r\nIt\'s Holy St. Olaf his own silver chest that he had. But the Marble\r\nChurch--that was a little church all of pure marble--the Danes took\r\nthat from us in the war...."\r\n\r\nIt was time for the women to go. Oline took Inger aside, led her out\r\ninto the larder where she knew all the cheeses were stored, and closed\r\nthe door. "What is it?" asked Inger.\r\n\r\nOline whispered: "Os-Anders, he doesn\'t dare come here any more. I\'ve\r\ntold him."\r\n\r\n"Ho!" said Inger.\r\n\r\n"I told him if he only dared, after what he\'d done to you."\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Inger. "But he\'s been here many a time since for all that.\r\nAnd he can come if he likes, I\'m not afraid."\r\n\r\n"No, that\'s so," said Oline. "But I know what I know, and if you like,\r\nI\'ll lay a charge against him."\r\n\r\n"Ho!" said Inger. "No, you\'ve no call to do that. Tis not worth it."\r\n\r\nBut she was not ill pleased to have Oline on her side; it cost her a\r\ncheese, to be sure, but Oline thanked her so fulsomely: "\'Tis as I\r\nsay, \'tis as I\'ve always said: Inger, she gives with both hands;\r\nnothing grudging, nothing sparing about her! No, maybe you\'re not\r\nafraid of Os-Anders, but I\'ve forbid him to come here all the same.\r\n\'Twas the least I could do for you."\r\n\r\nSaid Inger then: "What harm could it do if he did come, anyway? He\r\ncan\'t hurt me any more."\r\n\r\nOline pricked up her ears: "Ho, you\'ve learned a way yourself, maybe?"\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t have any more children," said Inger.\r\n\r\nAnd now they were quits, each holding as good a trump as the other:\r\nfor Oline stood there knowing all the time that Os-Anders the Lapp had\r\ndied the day before....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhy should Inger say that about having no more children? She was not\r\non bad terms with her husband, \'twas no cat-and-dog life between\r\nthem--far from it. They had each their own little ways, but it was\r\nrarely they quarrelled, and never for long at a time; it was soon made\r\nup. And many a time Inger would suddenly be just as she had been in\r\nthe old days, working hard in the cowshed or in the field; as if she\r\nhad had a relapse into health again. And at such times Isak would look\r\nat his wife with grateful eyes; if he had been the sort of man to\r\nspeak his mind at once, he might have said, "H\'m. What does this mean,\r\nheh?" or something of the sort, just to show he appreciated it. But\r\nhe waited too long, and his praise came too late. So Inger, no doubt,\r\nfound it not worth while, and did not care to keep it up.\r\n\r\nShe might have had children till past fifty; as it was, she was\r\nperhaps hardly forty now. She had learned all sorts of things at the\r\ninstitution--had she also learned to play tricks with herself? She\r\nhad come back so thoroughly trained and educated after her long\r\nassociation with the other murderesses; maybe the men had taught her\r\nsomething too--the gaolers, the doctors. She told Isak one day what\r\none young medical man had said of her little crime: "Why should it be\r\na criminal offence to kill children--ay, even healthy children? They\r\nwere nothing but lumps of flesh after all."\r\n\r\nIsak asked: "Wasn\'t he terribly cruel himself, then?"\r\n\r\n"Him!" exclaimed Inger, and told how kind he had been to her herself;\r\nit was he who had got another doctor to operate on her mouth and make\r\na human being of her. Now there was only a scar to be seen.\r\n\r\nOnly a scar, yes. And a fine woman she was in her way, tall and not\r\nover-stout, dark, with rich hair; in summer she went barefooted\r\nmostly, and with her skirt kilted high; Inger was not afraid of\r\nletting her calves be seen. Isak saw them--as who did not!\r\n\r\nThey did not quarrel, no. Isak had no talent for quarrelling, and his\r\nwife had grown readier-witted to answer back. A thorough good quarrel\r\ntook a long time to grow with Isak, heavy stub of a man as he was;\r\nhe found himself all entangled in her words, and could say next to\r\nnothing himself; and besides, he was fond of her--powerfully in love\r\nwas Isak. And it was not often he had any need to answer. Inger did\r\nnot complain; he was an excellent husband in many ways, and she let\r\nhim alone. What had she to complain of at all? Isak was not a man to\r\nbe despised; she might have married a worse. Worn out, was he? True,\r\nhe showed signs of being tired now at times, but nothing serious. He\r\nwas full of old health and unwasted strength, like herself, and in\r\nthis autumn of their married life he fulfilled his part at least as\r\naffectionately as she did.\r\n\r\nBut nothing particularly beautiful nor grand about him? No. And here\r\ncame her superiority. Inger might well think to herself at times how\r\nshe had seen finer men; handsome gentlemen with walking-sticks and\r\nhandkerchiefs and starched collars to wear--oh, those gentlemen of the\r\ntown! And so she kept Isak in his place, treated him, as it were, no\r\nbetter than he deserved. He was only a peasant, a clodhopper of the\r\nwilds; if her mouth had been as it was now from the start she would\r\nnever have taken him; be sure of that. No, she could have done better\r\nthan that! The home he had given her, the life he offered her, were\r\npoor enough; she might at least have married some one from her own\r\nvillage, and lived among neighbours, with a circle of friends, instead\r\nof here like an outcast in the wilds. It was not the place for her\r\nnow; she had learned to look differently at life.\r\n\r\nStrange, how one could come to look differently at things! Inger found\r\nno pleasure now in admiring a new calf; she did not clap her hands in\r\nsurprise when Isak came down from the hills with a big basket of fish;\r\nno, she had lived for six years among greater things. And of late she\r\nhad even ceased to be heavenly and sweet when she called him in to\r\ndinner. "Your food\'s ready, aren\'t you coming in?" was all she said\r\nnow. And it didn\'t sound nice. Isak wondered a little at first; it was\r\na curious way to speak; a nasty, uncaring, take-it-or-leave-it way to\r\nspeak. And he answered: "Why, I didn\'t know \'twas ready." But when\r\nInger pointed out that he ought to have known, or might have guessed\r\nit, anyway, by the sun, he said no more, and let the matter drop.\r\n\r\nAh, but once he got a hold on her and used it--that was when she tried\r\nto steal his money from him. Not that Isak was a miser in that way,\r\nbut the money was clearly his. Ho, it was nearly being ruin and\r\ndisaster for her that time! But even then it was not exactly\r\nthoroughgoing, out-and-out wickedness on Inger\'s part; she wanted the\r\nmoney for Eleseus--for her blessed boy Eleseus in town, who was asking\r\nfor his _Daler_ again. Was he to go there among all the fine folk and\r\nwith empty pockets? After all, she had a mother\'s heart. She asked his\r\nfather for the money first, and, finding it was no good, had taken it\r\nherself. Whether Isak had had some suspicion beforehand, or had found\r\nit out by accident--anyhow, it was found out. And suddenly Inger found\r\nherself gripped by both arms, felt herself lifted from the floor,\r\nand thumped down on to the floor again. It was something strange and\r\nterrible--a sort of avalanche. Isak\'s hands were not weak, not worn\r\nout now. Inger gave a groan, her head fell back, she shivered, and\r\ngave up the money.\r\n\r\nEven then Isak said little, though Inger made no attempt to hinder him\r\nfrom speaking. What he did say was uttered, as it were, in one hard\r\nbreath: "Huttch! You--you\'re not fit to have in the place!"\r\n\r\nShe hardly knew him again. Oh, but it must have been long-stored\r\nbitterness that would not be repressed.\r\n\r\nA miserable day, and a long night, and a day beyond. Isak went out of\r\nthe house and lay outside, for all that there was hay to be got in;\r\nSivert was with his father. Inger had little Leopoldine and the\r\nanimals to keep her company; but lonely she was for all that, crying\r\nnearly all the time and shaking her head at herself. Only once in all\r\nher life before had she felt so moved, and this day called it to mind;\r\nit was when she had lain in her bed and throttled a newborn child.\r\n\r\nWhere were Isak and his son? They had not been idle; no, they had\r\nstolen a day and a night or thereabouts from the haymaking, and had\r\nbuilt a boat up on the lake. Oh, a rough and poor-looking vessel\r\nenough, but strong and sound as their work had always been; they had a\r\nboat now, and could go fishing with nets.\r\n\r\nWhen they came home the hay was dry as ever. They had cheated\r\nprovidence by trusting it, and suffered no loss; they had gained by\r\nit. And then Sivert flung out an arm, and said: "Ho! Mother\'s been\r\nhaymaking!" Isak looked down over the fields and said "H\'m." Isak had\r\nnoticed already that some of the hay had been shifted; Inger ought to\r\nbe home now for her midday meal. It was well done indeed of her to get\r\nin the hay, after he had scolded her the day before and said "Huttch!"\r\nAnd it was no light hay to move; she must have worked hard, and all\r\nthe cows and goats to milk besides.... "Go in and get something to\r\neat," he said to Sivert.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you coming, then?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\nA little while after, Inger came out and stood humbly on the door-slab\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n"If you\'d think of yourself a little--and come in and have a bite to\r\neat."\r\n\r\nIsak grumbled at that and said "H\'m." But it was so strange a thing\r\nof late for Inger to be humble in any way, that his stubbornness was\r\nshaken.\r\n\r\n"If you could manage to set a couple of teeth in my rake, I could get\r\non again with the hay," said she. Ay, she came to her husband, the\r\nmaster of the place, to ask for something, and was grateful that he\r\ndid not turn scornfully away.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve worked enough," said he, "raking and carting and all."\r\n\r\n"No, \'tis not enough."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no time, anyway, to mend rakes now. You can see there\'s rain\r\ncoming soon."\r\n\r\nAnd Isak went off to his work.\r\n\r\nIt was all meant to save her, no doubt; for the couple of minutes it\r\nwould have taken to mend the rake would have been more than tenfold\r\nrepaid by letting Inger work on. Anyhow, Inger came out with her rake\r\nas it was, and fell to haymaking with a will; Sivert came up with the\r\nhorse and haycart, and all went at it, sweating at the work, and\r\nthe hay was got in. It was a good stroke of work, and Isak fell to\r\nthinking once more of the powers above that guide all our ways--from\r\nstealing a _Daler_ to getting a crop of hay. Moreover, there lay\r\nthe boat; after half a generation of thinking it over, the boat was\r\nfinished; it was there, up on the lake.\r\n\r\n"Eyah, _Herregud_!" said Isak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a strange evening altogether: a turning-point. Inger had been\r\nrunning off the line for a long time now; and one lift up from the\r\nfloor had set her in her place again. Neither spoke of what had\r\nhappened. Isak had felt ashamed of himself after--all for the sake of\r\na _Daler_, a trifle of money, that he would have had to give her after\r\nall, because he himself would gladly have let the boy have it. And\r\nthen again--was not the money as much Inger\'s as his own? There came a\r\ntime when Isak found it his turn to be humble.\r\n\r\nThere came many sorts of times. Inger must have changed her mind\r\nagain, it seemed; once more she was different, gradually forgetting\r\nher fine ways and turning earnest anew: a settler\'s wife, earnest and\r\nthoughtful as she had been before. To think that a man\'s hard grip\r\ncould work such wonders! But it was right; here was a strong and\r\nhealthy woman, sensible enough, but spoiled and warped by long\r\nconfinement in an artificial air--and she had butted into a man who\r\nstood firmly on his feet. Never for a moment had he left his natural\r\nplace on the earth, on the soil. Nothing could move him.\r\n\r\nMany sorts of times. Next year came the drought again, killing the\r\ngrowth off slowly, and wearing down human courage. The corn stood\r\nthere and shrivelled up; the potatoes--the wonderful potatoes--they\r\ndid not shrivel up, but flowered and flowered. The meadows turned\r\ngrey, but the potatoes flowered. The powers above guided all things,\r\nno doubt, but the meadows were turning grey.\r\n\r\nThen one day came Geissler--ex-Lensmand Geissler came again at last.\r\nIt was good to find that he was not dead, but had turned up again. And\r\nwhat had he come for now?\r\n\r\nGeissler had no grand surprises with him this time, by the look of it;\r\nno purchases of mining rights and documents and such-like. Geissler\r\nwas poorly dressed, his hair and beard turned greyer, and his eyes\r\nredder at the edges than before. He had no man, either, to carry his\r\nthings, but had his papers in a pocket, and not even a bag.\r\n\r\n"_Goddag_" said Geissler.\r\n\r\n"_Goddag_" answered Isak and Inger. "Here\'s the like of visitors to\r\nsee this way!"\r\n\r\nGeissler nodded.\r\n\r\n"And thanks for all you did that time--in Trondhjem," said Inger all\r\nby herself.\r\n\r\nAnd Isak nodded at that, and said: "Ay, \'tis two of us owe you thanks\r\nfor that."\r\n\r\nBut Geissler--it was not his way to be all feelings and sentiments; he\r\nsaid: "Yes, I\'m just going across to Sweden."\r\n\r\nFor all their trouble of mind over the drought, Sellanraa\'s folk were\r\nglad to see Geissler again; they gave him the best they had, and were\r\nheartily glad to do what they could for him after all he had done.\r\n\r\nGeissler himself had no troubles that could be seen; he grew talkative\r\nat once, looked out over the fields and nodded. He carried himself\r\nupright as ever, and looked as if he had several hundreds of _Daler_\r\nin his pockets. It livened them up and brightened everything to have\r\nhim there; not that he made any boisterous fun, but a lively talker,\r\nthat he was.\r\n\r\n"Fine place, Sellanraa, splendid place," he said. "And now there\'s\r\nothers coming up one after another, since you\'ve started, Isak. I\r\ncounted five myself. Are there any more?"\r\n\r\n"Seven in all. There\'s two that can\'t be seen from the road."\r\n\r\n"Seven holdings; say fifty souls. Why, it\'ll be a densely populated\r\nneighbourhood before long. And you\'ve a school already, so I hear?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, we have."\r\n\r\n"There--what did I say? A school all to yourselves, down by Brede\'s\r\nplace, being more in the middle. Fancy Brede as a farmer in the\r\nwilds!" and Geissler laughed at the thought. "Ay, I\'ve heard all about\r\nyou, Isak; you\'re the best man here. And I\'m glad of it. Sawmill, too,\r\nyou\'ve got?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, such as it is. But it serves me well enough. And I\'ve sawed a bit\r\nnow and again for them down below."\r\n\r\n"Bravo! That\'s the way!"\r\n\r\n"I\'d be glad to hear what you think of it, Lensmand, if so be you\'d\r\ncare to look at that sawmill for yourself."\r\n\r\nGeissler nodded, with the air of an expert; yes, he would look at\r\nit, examine it thoroughly. Then he asked: "You had two boys, hadn\'t\r\nyou--what\'s become of the other? In town? Clerk in an office? H\'m,"\r\nsaid Geissler. "But this one here looks a sturdy sort--what was your\r\nname, now?"\r\n\r\n"Sivert."\r\n\r\n"And the other one?"\r\n\r\n"Eleseus."\r\n\r\n"And he\'s in an engineer\'s office--what\'s he reckon to learn there? A\r\nstarvation-business. Much better have come to me," said Geissler.\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Isak, for politeness\' sake. He felt a sort of pity for\r\nGeissler at the moment. Oh, that good man did not look as if he could\r\nafford to keep clerks; had to work hard enough by himself, belike.\r\nThat jacket--it was worn to fringes at the wrists.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you have some dry hose to put on?" said Inger, and brought out\r\na pair of her own. They were from her best days; fine and thin, with a\r\nborder.\r\n\r\n"No, thanks," said Geissler shortly, though he must have been wet\r\nthrough.--"Much better have come to me," he said again, speaking of\r\nEleseus. "I want him badly." He took a small silver tobacco box from\r\nhis pocket and sat playing with it in his fingers. It was perhaps the\r\nonly thing of value left him now.\r\n\r\nBut Geissler was restless, changing from one thing to another. He\r\nslipped the thing back into his pocket again and started a new theme.\r\n"But--what\'s that? Why, the meadow that\'s all grey. I thought it was\r\nthe shadow. The ground is simply parched. Come along with me, Sivert."\r\n\r\nHe rose from the table suddenly, thinking no more of food, turned in\r\nthe doorway to say "Thank you" to Inger for the meal, and disappeared,\r\nSivert following.\r\n\r\nThey went across to the river, Geissler peering keenly about all the\r\ntime. "Here!" he cried, and stopped. And then he explained: "Where\'s\r\nthe sense of letting your land dry up to nothing when you\'ve a river\r\nthere big enough to drown it in a minute? We\'ll have, that meadow\r\ngreen by tomorrow!"\r\n\r\nSivert, all astonishment, said "Yes."\r\n\r\n"Dig down obliquely from here, see?--on a slope. The ground\'s level;\r\nhave to make some sort of a channel. You\'ve a sawmill there--I suppose\r\nyou can find some long planks from somewhere? Good! Run and fetch a\r\npick and spade, and start here; I\'ll go back and mark out a proper\r\nline."\r\n\r\nHe ran up to the house again, his boots squelching, for they were wet\r\nthrough. He set Isak to work making pipes, a whole lot of them, to be\r\nlaid down where the ground could not well be cut with ditches. Isak\r\ntried to object that the water might not get so far; the dry ground\r\nwould soak it up before it reached the parched fields. Geissler\r\nexplained that it would take some time; the earth must drink a little\r\nfirst, but then gradually the water would go on--"field and meadow\r\ngreen by this time tomorrow."\r\n\r\n"Ho!" said Isak, and fell to boxing up long planks as hard as he\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nOff hurries Geissler to Sivert once more: "That\'s right--keep at\r\nit--didn\'t I say he was a sturdy sort? Follow these stakes, you\r\nunderstand, where I\'ve marked out. If you come up against heavy\r\nboulders, or rock, then turn aside and go round, but keep the\r\nlevel--the same depth; you see what I mean?"\r\n\r\nThen back to Isak again: "That\'s one finished--good! But we shall want\r\nmore--half a dozen, perhaps. Keep at it, Isak; you see, we\'ll have it\r\nall green by tomorrow--we\'ve saved your crops!" And Geissler sat down\r\non the ground, slapped his knees with both hands and was delighted,\r\nchattered away, thought in flashes of lightning. "Any pitch, any\r\noakum, or anything about the place? That\'s splendid--got everything.\r\nThese things\'ll leak at the edges you see, to begin with, but the\r\nwood\'ll swell after a while, and they\'ll be as taut as a bottle. Oakum\r\nand pitch--fancy you having it too!--What? Built a boat, you say?\r\nWhere is the boat? Up in the lake? Good! I must have a look at that\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\nOh, Geissler was all promises. Light come, light go--and he seemed\r\nmore giving to fussing about than before. He worked at things by\r\nfits and starts, but at a furious rate when he did work. There was\r\na certain superiority about him after all. True, he exaggerated a\r\nbit--it was impossible, of course, to get all green by this time\r\ntomorrow, as he had said, but for all that, Geissler was a sharp\r\nfellow, quick to see and take a decision; ay, a strange man was\r\nGeissler. And it was he and no other that saved the crops that year at\r\nSellanraa.\r\n\r\n"How many have you got done? Not enough. The more wood you can lay,\r\nthe quicker it\'ll flow. Make them twenty feet long or twenty-five,\r\nif you can. Any planks that length on the place? Good; fetch them\r\nalong--you\'ll find it\'ll pay you at harvest-time!"\r\n\r\nRestless again--up and off to Sivert once more. "That\'s the way,\r\nSivert man; getting on finely. Your father\'s turning out culverts like\r\na poet, there\'ll be more than I ever thought. Run across and get some\r\nnow, and we\'ll make a start."\r\n\r\nAll that afternoon was one hurrying spell; Sivert had never seen such\r\na furious piece of work; he was not accustomed to see things done at\r\nthat pace. They hardly gave themselves time to eat. But the water was\r\nflowing already! Here and there they had to dig deeper, a culvert had\r\nto be raised or lowered, but it flowed. The three men were at it till\r\nlate that night, touching up their work, and keenly on the look out\r\nfor any fault. But when the water began to trickle out over the driest\r\nspots, there was joy and delight at Sellanraa. "I forgot to bring my\r\nwatch," said Geissler. "What\'s the time, I wonder? Ay, she\'ll be green\r\nby this time tomorrow!" said he.\r\n\r\nSivert got up in the middle of the night to see how things were going,\r\nand found his father out already on the same errand. Oh, but it was a\r\nthrilling time--a day of great events!\r\n\r\nBut next day, Geissler stayed in bed till nearly noon, worn out now\r\nthat the fit had passed. He did not trouble to go up and look at the\r\nboat on the lake; and but for what he had said the day before, he\r\nwould never have bothered to look at the sawmill. Even the irrigation\r\nworks interested him less than at first--and when he saw that neither\r\nfield nor meadow had turned green in the course of the night, he lost\r\nheart, never thinking of how the water flowed, and flowed all the\r\ntime, and spread out farther and farther over the ground. He backed\r\ndown a little, and said now: "It may take time--you won\'t see any\r\nchange perhaps before tomorrow again. But it\'ll be all right, never\r\nfear."\r\n\r\nLater in the day Brede Olsen came lounging in; he had brought some\r\nsamples of rock he wanted Geissler to see. "And something out of the\r\ncommon, this time, to my mind," said Brede.\r\n\r\nGeissler would not look at the things. "That the way you manage a\r\nfarm," he asked scornfully, "pottering about up in the hills looking\r\nfor a fortune?"\r\n\r\nBrede apparently did not fancy being taken to task now by his former\r\nchief; he answered sharply, without any form of respect, treating the\r\nex-Lensmand as an equal: "If you think I care what you say ..."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve no more sense than you had before," said Geissler. "Fooling\r\naway your time."\r\n\r\n"What about yourself?" said Brede. "What about you, I\'d like to know?\r\nYou\'ve got a mine of your own up here, and what have you done with it?\r\nHuh! Lies there doing nothing. Ay, you\'re the sort to have a mine,\r\naren\'t you? He he!"\r\n\r\n"Get out of this," said Geissler. And Brede did not stay long, but\r\nshouldered his load of samples and went down to his own _menage_,\r\nwithout saying good-bye.\r\n\r\nGeissler sat down and began to look over some papers with a thoughtful\r\nair. He seemed to have caught a touch of the fever himself, and wanted\r\nnow to look over that business of the copper mine, the contract, the\r\nanalyses. It was fine ore, almost pure copper; he must do something\r\nwith it, and not let everything slide.\r\n\r\n"What I really came up for was to get the whole thing settled," he\r\nsaid to Isak. "I\'ve been thinking of making a start here, and that\r\nvery soon. Get a lot of men to work, and run the thing properly. What\r\ndo you think?"\r\n\r\nIsak felt sorry for the man, and would not say anything against it.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a matter that concerns you as well, you know. There\'ll be a lot\r\nof bother, of course; a lot of men about the place, and a bit rowdy at\r\ntimes, perhaps. And blasting up in the hills--I don\'t know how you\'ll\r\nlike that. On the other hand, there\'ll be more life in the district\r\nwhere we begin, and you\'ll have a good market close at hand for farm\r\nproduce and that sort of thing. Fix your own price, too."\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Isak.\r\n\r\n"Besides your share in the mine--you\'ll get a high percentage of\r\nearnings, you know. Big money, Isak."\r\n\r\nSaid Isak: "You\'ve paid me fairly already, and more than enough...."\r\n\r\nNext morning Geissler left, hurrying off eastward, over toward Sweden.\r\n"No, thanks," he said shortly, when Isak offered to go with him. It\r\nwas almost painful to see him start off in that poor fashion, on foot\r\nand all alone. Inger had put up a fine parcel of food for him to take,\r\nall as nice as she could make it, and made some wafers specially to\r\nput in. Even that was not enough; she would have given him a can of\r\ncream and a whole lot of eggs, but he wouldn\'t carry them, and Inger\r\nwas disappointed.\r\n\r\nGeissler himself must have found it hard to leave Sellanraa without\r\npaying as he generally did for his keep; so he pretended that he had\r\npaid; made as if he had laid down a big note in payment, and said to\r\nlittle Leopoldine: "Here, child, here\'s something for you as well."\r\nAnd with that he gave her the silver box, his tobacco box. "You can\r\nrinse it out and use it to keep pins and things in," he said. "It\'s\r\nnot the sort of thing for a present really. If I were at home I could\r\nhave found her something else; I\'ve a heap of things...."\r\n\r\nBut Geissler\'s waterwork remained after Geissler had gone; there it\r\nwas, working wonders day and night, week after week; the fields turned\r\ngreen, the potatoes ceased to flower, the corn shot up....\r\n\r\nThe settlers from the holdings farther down began to come up, all\r\nanxious to see the marvel for themselves. Axel Stroem,--the neighbour\r\nfrom Maaneland, the man who had no wife, and no woman to help him, but\r\nmanaged for himself,--he came too. He was in a good humour that day;\r\nhe told them how he had just got a promise of a girl to help through\r\nthe summer--and that was a weight off his mind. He did not say who the\r\ngirl was, and Isak did not ask, but it was Brede\'s girl Barbro who was\r\nto come. It would cost the price of a telegram to Bergen to fetch her;\r\nbut Axel paid the money, though he was not one of your extravagant\r\nsort, but rather something of a miser.\r\n\r\nIt was the waterwork business that had enticed him up today; he had\r\nlooked it over from one end to the other, and was highly interested.\r\nThere was no big river on his land, but he had a bit of a stream; he\r\nhad no planks, either, to make culverts with, but he would dig his\r\nchannels in the earth; it could be done. Up to now, things were not\r\nabsolutely at their worst on his land, which lay lower down the\r\nslopes; but if the drought continued, he, too, would have to irrigate.\r\nWhen he had seen what he wanted, he took his leave and went back at\r\nonce. No, he would not come in, hadn\'t the time; he was going to start\r\nditching that same evening. And off he went.\r\n\r\nThis was something different from Brede\'s way.\r\n\r\nOh, Brede, he could run about the moorland farms now telling news:\r\nmiraculous waterworks at Sellanraa! "It doesn\'t pay to work your soil\r\novermuch," he had said. "Look at Isak up there; he\'s dug and dug about\r\nso long that at last he\'s had to water the whole ground."\r\n\r\nIsak was patient, but he wished many a time that he could get rid of\r\nthe fellow, hanging about Sellanraa with his boastful ways. Brede put\r\nit all down to the telegraph; as long as he was a public official, it\r\nwas his duty to keep the line in order. But the telegraph company had\r\nalready had occasion several times to reprimand him for neglect, and\r\nhad again offered the post to Isak. No, it was not the telegraph that\r\nwas in Brede\'s mind all the time, but the ore up in the hills; it was\r\nhis one idea now, a mania.\r\n\r\nHe took to dropping in often now at Sellanraa, confident that he had\r\nfound the treasure; he would nod his head and say: "I can\'t tell\r\nyou all about it yet, but I don\'t mind saying I\'ve struck something\r\nremarkable this time." Wasting hours and energy all for nothing. And\r\nwhen he came back in the evening to his little house, he would fling\r\ndown a little sack of samples on the floor, and puff and blow after\r\nhis day\'s work, as if no man could have toiled harder for his daily\r\nbread. He grew a few potatoes on sour, peaty soil, and cut the tufts\r\nof grass that grew by themselves on the ground about the house--that\r\nwas Brede\'s farming. He was never made for a farmer, and there could\r\nbe but one end to it all. His turf roof was falling to pieces already,\r\nand the steps to the kitchen were rotten with damp; a grindstone lay\r\non the ground, and the cart was still left uncovered in the open.\r\n\r\nBrede was fortunate perhaps in that such little matters never troubled\r\nhim. When the children rolled his grindstone about for play, he was\r\nkind and indulgent, and would even help them to roll it himself. An\r\neasy-going, idle nature, never serious, but also never down-hearted, a\r\nweak, irresponsible character; but he managed to find food, such as it\r\nwas, and kept himself and his alive from day to day; managed to keep\r\nthem somehow. But it was not to be expected that the storekeeper could\r\ngo on feeding Brede and his family for ever; he had said so more than\r\nonce to Brede himself, and he said it now in earnest. Brede admitted\r\nhe was right, and promised to turn over a new leaf--he would sell his\r\nplace, and very likely make a good thing out of it--and pay what he\r\nowed at the store!\r\n\r\nOh, but Brede would sell out anyhow, even at a loss; what was the good\r\nof a farm for him? He was home-sick for the village again, the easy\r\ngossiping life there, and the little shop--it suited him better than\r\nsettling down here to work, and trying to forget the world outside.\r\nCould he ever forget the Christmas trees and parties, or the\r\nnational feastings on Constitution Day, or the bazaars held in the\r\nmeeting-rooms? He loved to talk with his kind, to exchange news and\r\nviews, but who was there to talk with here? Inger up at Sellanraa\r\nhad seemed to be one of his sort for a while, but then she had\r\nchanged--there was no getting a word out of her now. And besides, she\r\nhad been in prison; and for a man in his position--no, it would never\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nNo, he had made a mistake in ever leaving the village; it was throwing\r\nhimself away. He noted with envy that the Lensmand had got another\r\nassistant, and the doctor another man to drive for him; he had run\r\naway from the people who needed him, and now that he was no longer\r\nthere, they managed without him. But the men who had taken his\r\nplace--they were no earthly good, of course. Properly speaking, he,\r\nBrede, ought to be fetched back to the village in triumph!\r\n\r\nThen there was Barbro--why had he backed up the idea of getting her to\r\ngo as help to Sellanraa? Well, that was after talking over things with\r\nhis wife. If all went well, it might mean a good future for the girl,\r\nperhaps a future of a sort for all of them. All very well to be\r\nhousekeeper for two young clerks in Bergen, but who could say what she\r\nwould get out of that in the long run? Barbro was a pretty girl, and\r\nliked to look well; there might be a better chance for her here, after\r\nall. For there were two sons at Sellanraa.\r\n\r\nBut when Brede saw that this plan would never come to anything, he\r\nhit on another. After all, there was no great catch in marrying into\r\nInger\'s lot--Inger who had been in prison. And there were other lads\r\nto be thought of besides those two Sellanraa boys--there was Axel\r\nStroem, for instance. He had a farm and a hut of his own, he was a man\r\nwho scraped and saved and little by little managed to get hold of a\r\nbit of live stock and such-like, but with no wife, and no woman to\r\nhelp him. "Well, I don\'t mind telling you, if you take Barbro, she\'ll\r\nbe all the help you\'ll need," said Brede to him. "Look, here\'s her\r\npicture; you can see."\r\n\r\nAnd after a week or so, came Barbro. Axel was in the midst of his\r\nhaymaking, and had to do his mowing by day and haymaking by night, and\r\nall by himself--and then came Barbro! It was a godsend. Barbro soon\r\nshowed she was not afraid of work; she washed clothes and cleaned\r\nthings, cooked and milked and helped in the hayfield--helped to carry\r\nin the hay, she did. Axel determined to give her good wages, and not\r\nlose by it.\r\n\r\nShe was not merely a photograph of a fine lady here. Barbro was\r\nstraight and thin, spoke somewhat hoarsely, showed sense and\r\nexperience in various ways--she was not a child. Axel wondered what\r\nmade her so thin and haggard in the face. "I\'d know you by your\r\nlooks," he said; "but you\'re not like the photograph."\r\n\r\n"That\'s only the journey," she said, "and living in town air all that\r\ntime."\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, she very soon grew plump and well-looking again. "Take my\r\nword for it," said Barbro, "it pulls you down a bit, a journey\r\nlike that, and living in town like that." She hinted also at the\r\ntemptations of life in Bergen--one had to be careful there. But\r\nwhile they sat talking, she begged him to take in a paper--a Bergen\r\nnewspaper--so that she could read a bit and see the news of the world.\r\nShe had got accustomed to reading, and theatres and music, and it was\r\nso dull in a place like this.\r\n\r\nAxel was pleased with the results of his summer help, and took in a\r\npaper. He also bore with the frequent visits of the Brede family, who\r\nwere constantly dropping in at his place and eating and drinking. He\r\nwas anxious to show that he appreciated this servant-girl of his.\r\nAnd what could be nicer and homelier than when Barbro sat there of a\r\nSunday evening twanging the strings of a guitar and singing a little\r\nwith her hoarse voice? Axel, was touched by it all, by the pretty,\r\nstrange songs, by the mere fact that some one really sat there singing\r\non his poor half-baked farm.\r\n\r\nTrue, in the course of the summer he learned to know other sides of\r\nBarbro\'s character, but on the whole, he was content. She had her\r\nfancies, and could answer hastily at times; was somewhat over-quick to\r\nanswer back. That Saturday evening, for instance, when Axel himself\r\nhad to go down to the village to get some things, it was wrong of\r\nBarbro to run away from the hut and the animals and leave the place to\r\nitself. They had a few words over that. And where had she been? Only\r\nto her home, to Breidablik, but still ... When Axel came back to the\r\nhut that night, Barbro was not there; he looked to the animals, got\r\nhimself something to eat, and turned in. Towards morning Barbro came.\r\n"I only wanted to see what it was like to step on a wooden floor\r\nagain," she said, somewhat scornfully. And Axel could find nothing\r\nmuch to say to that, seeing that he had as yet but a turf hut with a\r\nfloor of beaten earth. He did say, however, that if it came to that,\r\nhe could get a few planks himself, and no doubt but he\'d have a house\r\nwith a wooden floor himself in time! Barbro seemed penitent at that;\r\nshe was not altogether unkindly. And for all it was Sunday, she went\r\noff at once to the woods and gathered fresh juniper twigs to spread on\r\nthe earthen floor.\r\n\r\nAnd then, seeing she was so fine-hearted and behaved so splendidly,\r\nwhat could Axel do but bring out the kerchief he had bought for her\r\nthe evening before, though he had really thought of keeping it by a\r\nwhile, and getting something respectable out of her in return. And\r\nthere! she was pleased with it, and tried it on at once--ay, she\r\nturned to him and asked if she didn\'t look nice in it. And yes, indeed\r\nshe did; and she might put on his old fur cap if she liked, and she\'d\r\nlook nice in that! Barbro laughed at this and tried to say something\r\nreally nice in return; she said: "I\'d far rather go to church and\r\ncommunion in this kerchief than wear a hat. In Bergen, of course, we\r\nalways wore hats--all except common servant-girls from the country."\r\n\r\nFriends again, as nice as could be.\r\n\r\nAnd when Axel brought out the newspaper he had fetched from the post\r\noffice, Barbro sat down to read news of the world: of a burglary at\r\na jeweller\'s shop in one Bergen street, and a quarrel between two\r\ngipsies in another; of a horrible find in the harbour--the dead body\r\nof a newborn child sewed up in an old shirt with the sleeves cut off.\r\n"I wonder who can have done it?" said Barbro. And she read the list of\r\nmarketing prices too, as she always did.\r\n\r\nSo the summer passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat changes at Sellanraa.\r\n\r\nThere was no knowing the place again, after what it had been at first:\r\nsawmill, cornmill, buildings of all sorts and kinds--the wilderness\r\nwas peopled country now. And there was more to come. But Inger was\r\nperhaps the strangest of all; so altered she was, and good and clever\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe great event of last year, when things had come to a head, was\r\nhardly enough in itself, perhaps, to change her careless ways; there\r\nwas backsliding now and then, as when she found herself beginning to\r\ntalk of the "Institute" again, and the cathedral at Trondhjem. Oh,\r\ninnocent things enough; and she took off her ring, and let down that\r\nbold skirt of hers some inches. She was grown thoughtful, there was\r\nmore quiet about the place, and visits were less frequent; the girls\r\nand women from the village came but rarely now, for Inger no longer\r\ncared to see them. No one can live in the depth of the wilds and have\r\ntime for such foolishness. Happiness and nonsense are two different\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nIn the wilds, each season has its wonders, but always, unchangingly,\r\nthere is that immense heavy sound of heaven and earth, the sense\r\nof being surrounded on all sides, the darkness of the forest, the\r\nkindliness of the trees. All is heavy and soft, no thought is\r\nimpossible there. North of Sellanraa there was a little tarn, a mere\r\npuddle, no bigger than an aquarium. There lived some tiny baby fish\r\nthat never grew bigger, lived and died there and were no use at\r\nall--_Herregud_! no use on earth. One evening Inger stood there\r\nlistening for the cowbells; all was dead about her, she heard nothing,\r\nand then came a song from the tarn. A little, little song, hardly\r\nthere at all, almost lost. It was the tiny fishes\' song.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey had this good fortune at Sellanraa, that every spring and autumn\r\nthey could see the grey geese sailing in fleets above that wilderness,\r\nand hear their chatter up in the air--delirious talk it was. And as if\r\nthe world stood still for a moment, till the train of them had passed.\r\nAnd the human souls beneath, did they not feel a weakness gliding\r\nthrough them now? They went to their work again, but drawing breath\r\nfirst; something had spoken to them, something from beyond.\r\n\r\nGreat marvels were about them at all times; in the winter were the\r\nstars; in winter often, too, the northern lights, a firmament of\r\nwings, a conflagration in the mansions of God. Now and then, not\r\noften; not commonly, but now and then, they heard the thunder. It came\r\nmostly in the autumn, and a dark and solemn thing it was for man and\r\nbeast; the animals grazing near home would bunch together and stand\r\nwaiting. Bowing their heads--what for? Waiting for the end? And man,\r\nwhat of man standing in the wilds with bowed head, waiting, when the\r\nthunder came? Waiting for what?\r\n\r\nThe spring--ay, with its haste and joy and madcap delight; but the\r\nautumn! It called up a fear of darkness, drove one to an evening\r\nprayer; there were visions about, and warnings on the air. Folks might\r\ngo out one day in autumn seeking for something--the man for a piece\r\nof timber to his work, the woman after cattle that ran wild now after\r\nmushroom growths: they would come home with many secrets in their\r\nmind. Did they tread unexpectedly upon an ant, crushing its hind part\r\nfast to the path, so the fore part could not free itself again? Or\r\nstep too near a white grouse nest, putting up a fluttering hissing\r\nmother to dash against them? Even the big cow-mushrooms are not\r\naltogether meaningless; not a mere white emptiness in the eye. The big\r\nmushroom does not flower, it does not move, but there is something\r\noverturning in the look of it; it is a monster, a thing like a lung\r\nstanding there alive and naked--a lung without a body.\r\n\r\nInger grew despondent at last, the wilds oppressed her, she turned\r\nreligious. How could she help it? No one can help it in the wilds;\r\nlife there is not all earthly toil and worldliness; there is piety and\r\nthe fear of death and rich superstition. Inger, maybe, felt that she\r\nhad more reason than others to fear the judgment of Heaven, and it\r\nwould not pass her by; she knew how God walked about in the evening\r\ntime looking out over all His wilderness with fabulous eyes; ay, He\r\nwould find her. There was not so much in her daily life wherein she\r\ncould improve; true, she might bury her gold ring deep in the bottom\r\nof a clothes chest, and she could write to Eleseus and tell him to\r\nbe converted too; after that, there was nothing more she could find\r\nbeyond doing her work well and not sparing herself. Ay, one thing\r\nmore; she could dress in humble things, only fastening a blue ribbon\r\nat her neck of Sundays. False, unnecessary poverty--but it was the\r\nexpression of a kind of philosophy, self-humiliation, stoicism. The\r\nblue ribbon was not new; it had been cut from a cap little Leopoldine\r\nhad grown out of; it was faded here and there, and, to tell the truth,\r\na little dirty--Inger wore it now as a piece of modest finery on holy\r\ndays. Ay, it may be that she went beyond reason, feigning to be poor,\r\nstriving falsely to imitate the wretched who live in hovels; but even\r\nso--would her desert have been greater if that sorry finery had been\r\nher best? Leave her in peace; she has a right to peace!\r\n\r\nShe overdid things finely, and worked harder than she ought. There\r\nwere two men on the place, but Inger took the chance when both were\r\naway at once, and set to work herself sawing wood; and where was\r\nthe good of torturing and mortifying the flesh that way? She was so\r\ninsignificant a creature, so little worth, her powers of so common\r\na sort; her death or life would not be noticed in the land, in the\r\nState, only here in the wilds. Here, she was almost great--at any\r\nrate, the greatest; and she may well have thought herself worth all\r\nthe chastening she ordered and endured. Her husband said:\r\n\r\n"Sivert and I, we\'ve been talking about this; we\'re not going to have\r\nyou sawing wood, and wearing yourself out."\r\n\r\n"I do it for conscience\' sake," she answered.\r\n\r\nConscience! The word made Isak thoughtful once more. He was getting\r\non in years, slow to think, but weighty when he did come to anything.\r\nConscience must be something pretty strong if it could turn Inger all\r\nupside down like that. And however it might be, Inger\'s conversion\r\nmade a change in him also; he caught it from her, grew tame, and given\r\nto pondering. Life was all heavy-like and stern that winter; he sought\r\nfor loneliness, for a hiding-place. To save his own trees he had\r\nbought up a piece of the State forest near by, with some good timber,\r\nover toward the Swedish side, and he did the felling now alone,\r\nrefusing all help. Sivert was ordered to stay at home and see that his\r\nmother did not work too much.\r\n\r\nAnd so, in those short winter days, Isak went out to his work in the\r\ndark, and came home in the dark; it was not always there was a moon,\r\nor any stars, and at times his own track of the morning would be\r\ncovered with snow by nightfall, so he was hard put to it to find his\r\nway. And one evening something happened.\r\n\r\nHe was nearing home; in the fine moonlight he could see Sellanraa\r\nthere on the hillside, neat and clear of the forest, but small,\r\nundergroundish to look at, by reason of the snow banked high against\r\nthe walls. He had more timber now, and it was to be a grand surprise\r\nfor Inger and the children when they heard what use he would make of\r\nit--the wonderful building he had in mind. He sat down in the snow to\r\nrest a bit, not to seem worn out when he came home.\r\n\r\nAll is quiet around him, and God\'s blessing on this quiet and\r\nthoughtfulness, for it is nothing but good! Isak is a man at work on\r\na clearing in the forest, and he looks out over the ground, reckoning\r\nwhat is to be cleared next turn; heaving aside great stones in his\r\nmind--Isak had a real talent for that work. There, he knows now, is a\r\ndeep, bare patch on his ground; it is full of ore; there is always a\r\nmetallic film over every puddle of water there--and now he will dig\r\nit out. He marks out squares with his eye, making his plans for all,\r\nspeculating over all; they are to be made green and fruitful. Oh, but\r\na piece of tilled soil was a great and good thing; it was like right\r\nand order to his mind, and a delight beyond....\r\n\r\nHe got up, and felt suddenly confused. H\'m. What had happened now?\r\nNothing, only that he had been sitting down a bit. Now there is\r\nsomething standing there before him, a Being, a spirit; grey silk--no,\r\nit was nothing. He felt strange--took one short, uncertain step\r\nforward, and walked straight into a look, a great look, a pair of\r\neyes. At the same moment the aspens close by began rustling. Now any\r\none knows that an aspen can have a horrible eerie way of rustling at\r\ntimes; anyhow, Isak had never before heard such an utterly horrible\r\nrustling as this, and he shuddered. Also he put out one hand in front\r\nof him, and it was perhaps the most helpless movement that hand had\r\never made.\r\n\r\nBut what was this thing before him? Was it ghost-work or reality? Isak\r\nwould all his days have been ready to swear that this was a higher\r\npower, and once indeed he had seen it, but the thing he saw now\r\ndid not look like God. Possibly the Holy Ghost? If so, what was it\r\nstanding there for anyway, in the midst of nowhere; two eyes, a look,\r\nand nothing more? If it had come to him, to fetch away his soul, why,\r\nso it would have to be; it would happen one day, after all, and then\r\nhe would go to heaven and be among the blest.\r\n\r\nIsak was eager to see what would come next; he was shivering still; a\r\ncoldness seemed to radiate from the figure before him--it must be the\r\nEvil One! And here Isak was no longer sure of his ground, so to speak.\r\nIt might be the Evil One--but what did he want here? What had he,\r\nIsak, been doing? Nothing but sitting still and tilling the ground, as\r\nit were, in his thoughts--there could surely be no harm in that? There\r\nwas no other guilt he could call to mind just then; he was only coming\r\nback from his work in the forest, a tired and hungry woodman, going\r\nhome to Sellanraa--he means no harm....\r\n\r\nHe took a step forward again, but it was only a little one, and, to\r\ntell the truth, he stepped back again immediately. The vision would\r\nnot give way. Isak knitted his brows, as if beginning to suspect\r\nsomething. If it were the Evil One, why, let it be; the Evil One was\r\nnot all-powerful--there was Luther, for instance, who had nearly\r\nkilled the fiend himself, not to speak of many who had put him to\r\nflight by the sign of the cross and Jesu name. Not that Isak meant\r\nto defy the peril before him; it was not in his mind to sit down and\r\nlaugh in its face, but he certainly gave up his first idea of dying\r\nand the next world. He took two steps forward straight at the vision,\r\ncrossed himself, and cried out: "In Jesu name!"\r\n\r\nH\'m. At the sound of his own voice he came, as it were, to himself\r\nagain, and saw Sellanraa over on the hillside once more. The two eyes\r\nin the air had gone.\r\n\r\nHe lost no time in getting home, and took no steps to challenge the\r\nspectre further. But when he found himself once more safely on his own\r\ndoor-slab, he cleared his throat with a sense of power and security;\r\nhe walked into the house with lofty mien, like a man--ay, a man of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nInger started at the sight of him, and asked what made him so pale.\r\n\r\nAnd at that he did not deny having met the Evil One himself.\r\n\r\n"Where?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Over there. Right up towards our place."\r\n\r\nInger evinced no jealousy on her part. She did not praise him for it,\r\ntrue, but there was nothing in her manner suggestive of a hard word\r\nor a contemptuous kick. Inger herself, you see, had grown somewhat\r\nlighter of heart and kindlier of late, whatever the cause; and now she\r\nmerely asked:\r\n\r\n"The Evil One himself?"\r\n\r\nIsak nodded: as far as he could see it was himself and no other.\r\n\r\n"And how did you get rid of him?"\r\n\r\n"I went for him in Jesu name," said Isak.\r\n\r\nInger wagged her head, altogether overwhelmed, and it was some time\r\nbefore she could get his supper on the table.\r\n\r\n"Anyhow," said she at last, "we\'ll have no more of you going out alone\r\nin the woods by yourself."\r\n\r\nShe was anxious about him--and it did him good to know it. He made out\r\nto be as bold as ever, and altogether careless whether he went alone\r\nor in company; but this was only to quiet Inger\'s mind, not to\r\nfrighten her more than necessary with the awful thing that had\r\nhappened to himself. It was his place to protect her and them all; he\r\nwas the Man, the Leader.\r\n\r\nBut Inger saw through it also, and said: "Oh, I know you don\'t want to\r\nfrighten me. But you must take Sivert with you all the same."\r\n\r\nIsak only sniffed.\r\n\r\n"You might be taken poorly of a sudden, taken ill out in the\r\nwoods--you\'ve not been over well lately."\r\n\r\nIsak sniffed again. Ill? Tired, perhaps, and worn out a bit, but ill?\r\nNo need for Inger to start worrying and making a fool of him; he was\r\nsound and well enough; ate, slept, and worked; his health was simply\r\nterrific, it was incurable! Once, felling a tree, the thing had come\r\ndown on top of him, and broken his ear; but he made light of it. He\r\nset the ear in place again, and kept it there by wearing his cap\r\ndrawn over it night and day, and it grew together again that way. For\r\ninternal complaints, he dosed himself with _treak_ boiled in milk to\r\nmake him sweat--liquorice it was, bought at the store, an old and\r\ntried remedy, the _Teriak_ of the ancients. If he chanced to cut his\r\nhand, he treated the wound with an ever-present fluid containing\r\nsalts, and it healed up in a few days. No doctor was ever Sent for to\r\nSellanraa.\r\n\r\nNo, Isak was not ill. A meeting with the Evil One might happen even\r\nto the healthiest man. And he felt none the worse for his adventure\r\nafterwards; on the contrary, it seemed to have strengthened him. And\r\nas the winter drew on, and it was not such a dreadful time to wait\r\ntill the spring, he, the Man and the Leader, began to feel himself\r\nalmost a hero: he understood these things; only trust to him and\r\nall would be well. In case of need, he could exorcise the Evil One\r\nhimself!\r\n\r\nAltogether, the days were longer and lighter now; Easter was past,\r\nIsak had hauled up all his timber, everything looked bright, human\r\nbeings could breathe again after another winter gone.\r\n\r\nInger was again the first to brighten up; she had been more cheerful\r\nnow for a long time. What could it be? Ho, \'twas for a very simple\r\nreason; Inger was heavy again; expecting a child again. Everything\r\nworked out easily in her life, no hitch anywhere. But what a mercy,\r\nafter the way she had sinned! it was more than she had any right\r\nto expect. Ay, she was fortunate, fortunate. Isak himself actually\r\nnoticed something one day, and asked her straight out: "Looks to me as\r\nif you\'re on the way again; what do you say yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, Lord be thanked, \'tis surely so," she answered.\r\n\r\nThey were both equally astonished. Not that Inger was past the age,\r\nof course; to Isak\'s mind, she was not too old in any way. But still,\r\nanother child ... well, well.... And little Leopoldine going to school\r\nseveral times a year down at Breidablik--that left them with no little\r\nones about the place now--besides which, Leopoldine herself was grown\r\nup now.\r\n\r\nSome days passed, and Isak resolutely threw away a whole\r\nweek-end--from Saturday evening till Monday morning--on a trip down to\r\nthe village. He would not say what he was going for when he set out,\r\nbut on his return, he brought with him a girl. "This is Jensine," he\r\nsaid. "Come to help."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis all your nonsense," said Inger, "I\'ve no need of help at all."\r\n\r\nIsak answered that she did need a help--just now.\r\n\r\nNeed or not--it was a kind and generous thought of his; Inger was\r\nabashed and grateful. The new girl was a daughter of the blacksmith,\r\nand she was to stay with them for the present; through the summer,\r\nanyhow, and then they would see.\r\n\r\n"And I\'ve sent a telegram," said Isak, "after him Eleseus."\r\n\r\nThis fairly startled Inger; startled the mother. A telegram? Did he\r\nmean to upset her completely with his thoughtfulness? It had been\r\nher great sorrow of late that boy Eleseus was away in town--in the\r\nevil-minded town; she had written to him about God, and likewise\r\nexplained to him how his father here was beginning to sink under\r\nthe work, and the place getting bigger all the time; little Sivert\r\ncouldn\'t manage it all by himself, and besides, he was to have money\r\nafter his uncle one day--all this she had written, and sent him the\r\nmoney for his journey once for all. But Eleseus was a man-about-town\r\nnow, and had no sort of longing for a peasant\'s life; he answered\r\nsomething about what was he to do anyway if he did come home? Work on\r\na farm and throw away all the knowledge and learning he had gained?\r\n"In point of fact,"--that was how he put it,--"I\'ve no desire to come\r\nback now. And if you could send me some stuff for underclothes, it\r\nwould save me getting the things on credit." So he wrote. And yes, his\r\nmother sent him stuff--sent him remarkable quantities of stuff from\r\ntime to time for underclothes. But when she was converted, and got\r\nreligion, the scales fell from her eyes, and she understood that\r\nEleseus was selling the stuff and spending the money on other things.\r\n\r\nHis father saw it too. He never spoke of it; he knew that Eleseus was\r\nhis mother\'s darling, and how she cried over him and shook her head;\r\nbut one piece of finely woven stuff went after another the same\r\nway, and he knew it was more than any living man could use for\r\nunderclothes. Altogether, it came to this: Isak must be Man and Leader\r\nagain--head of the house, and step in and interfere. It had cost a\r\nterrible lot of money, to be sure, getting the storekeeper to send a\r\ntelegram; but in the first place, a telegram could not fail to make an\r\nimpression on the boy, and also--it was something unusually fine\r\nfor Isak himself to come home and tell Inger. He carried the\r\nservant-girl\'s box on his back as he strode home; but for all that, he\r\nwas proud and full of weighty secrets as he had been the day he came\r\nhome with that gold ring....\r\n\r\nIt was a grand time after that. For a long while, Inger could not do\r\nenough in the way of showing her husband how good and useful she could\r\nbe. She would say to him now, as in the old days: "You\'re working\r\nyourself to death!" Or again: "\'Tis more than any man can stand."\r\nOr again: "Now, you\'re not to work any more; come in and have\r\ndinner--I\'ve made some wafers for you!" And to please him, she said:\r\n"I should just like to know, now, what you\'ve got in your mind with\r\nall that wood, and what you\'re going to build, now, next?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I can\'t say as yet," said Isak, making a mystery of it.\r\n\r\nAy, just as in the old days. And after the child was born--and it\r\nwas a little girl--a great big girl, fine-looking and sturdy and\r\nsound--after that, Isak must have been a stone and a miserable\r\ncreature if he had not thanked God. But what was he going to build? It\r\nwould be more news for Oline to go gadding about with--a new building\r\nagain at Sellanraa. A new wing of the house--a new house it was to be.\r\nAnd there were so many now at Sellanraa--they had a servant-girl; and\r\nEleseus, he was coming home; and a brand-new little girl-child of\r\ntheir own, just come--the old house would be just an extra room now,\r\nnothing more.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, he had to tell Inger about it one day; she was so\r\ncurious to know, and though maybe Inger knew it all beforehand,\r\nfrom Sivert,--they two were often whispering together,--she was all\r\nsurprised as any one could be, and let her arms fall, and said: "\'Tis\r\nall your nonsense--you don\'t mean it?"\r\n\r\nAnd Isak, brimming over with greatness inside, he answered her: "Why,\r\nwith you bringing I don\'t know how many more children on the place,\r\n\'tis the least I can do, it seems."\r\n\r\nThe two menfolk were out now every day getting stone for the walls of\r\nthe new house. They worked their utmost together each in his own way:\r\nthe one young, and with his young body firmly set, quick to see his\r\nway, to mark out the stones that would suit; the other ageing--tough,\r\nwith long arms, and a mighty weight to bear down on a crowbar. When\r\nthey had managed some specially difficult feat, they would hold a\r\nbreathing-space, and talk together in a curious, reserved fashion of\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\n"Brede, he talks of selling out," said the father.\r\n\r\n"Ay," said the son. "Wonder what he\'ll be asking for the place?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, I wonder."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve not heard anything?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve heard two hundred."\r\n\r\nThe father thought for a while, and said: "What d\'you think, \'ll this\r\nbe a good stone?"\r\n\r\n"All depends if we can get this shell off him," said Sivert, and was\r\non his feet in a moment, giving the setting-hammer to his father, and\r\ntaking the sledge himself. He grew red and hot, stood up to his full\r\nheight and let the sledge-hammer fall; rose again and let it fall;\r\ntwenty strokes alike--twenty thunder-strokes. He spared neither tool\r\nnor strength; it was heavy work; his shirt rucked up from his trousers\r\nat the waist, leaving him bare in front; he lifted on his toes each\r\ntime to give the sledge a better swing. Twenty strokes.\r\n\r\n"Now! Let\'s look!" cried his father.\r\n\r\nThe son stops, and asks: "Marked him any?"\r\n\r\nAnd they lay down together to look at the stone; look at the beast,\r\nthe devil of a thing; no, not marked any as yet.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve a mind to try with the sledge alone," said the father, and stood\r\nup. Still harder work this, sheer force alone, the hammer grew hot,\r\nthe steel crushed, the pen grew blunt.\r\n\r\n"She\'ll be slipping the head," he said, and stopped. "And I\'m no hand\r\nat this any more," he said.\r\n\r\nOh, but he never meant it; it was not his thought, that he was no hand\r\nat the work any more!\r\n\r\nThis father, this barge of a man, simple, full of patience and\r\ngoodness, he would let his son strike the last few blows and cleave\r\nthe stone. And there it lay, split in two.\r\n\r\n"Ay, you\'ve the trick of it," said the father. "H\'m, yes ...\r\nBreidablik ... might make something but of that place."\r\n\r\n"Ay, should think so," said the son.\r\n\r\n"Only the land was fairly ditched and turned."\r\n\r\n"The house\'d have to be done up."\r\n\r\n"Ay, that of course. Place all done up--\'twould mean a lot of work at\r\nfirst, but ... What I was going to say, d\'you know if your mother was\r\ngoing to church come Sunday?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, she said something like it."\r\n\r\n"Ho!... H\'m. Keep your eyes open now and look out for a good big\r\ndoor-slab for the new house. You haven\'t seen a bit would do?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Sivert.\r\n\r\nAnd they fell to work again.\r\n\r\nA couple of days later both agreed they had enough stone now for the\r\nwalls. It was Friday evening; they sat taking a breathing-space, and\r\ntalking together the while.\r\n\r\n"H\'m--what d\'you say?" said the father. "Should we think it over,\r\nmaybe, about Breidablik?"\r\n\r\n"How d\'you mean?" asked the son. "What to do with it?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I don\'t know. There\'s the school there, and it\'s midway down\r\nthis tract now."\r\n\r\n"And what then?" asked the son. "I don\'t know what we\'d do with it,\r\nthough; it\'s not worth much as it is."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what you\'ve been thinking of?"\r\n\r\n"No, not that way.... Unless Eleseus he\'d like to have the place to\r\nwork on."\r\n\r\n"Eleseus? Well, no, I don\'t know--"\r\n\r\nLong pause, the two men thinking hard. The father begins gathering\r\ntools together, packing up to go home.\r\n\r\n"Ay, unless ..." said Sivert. "You might ask him what he says."\r\n\r\nThe father made an end of the matter thus: "Well, there\'s another day,\r\nand we haven\'t found that door-slab yet, either."\r\n\r\nNext day was Saturday, and they had to be off early to get across the\r\nhills with the child. Jensine, the servant-girl, was to go with them;\r\nthat was one godmother, the rest they would have to find from among\r\nInger\'s folk on the other side.\r\n\r\nInger looked nice; she had made herself a dainty cotton dress, with\r\nwhite at the neck and wrists. The child was all in white, with a new\r\nblue silk ribbon drawn through the lower edge of its dress; but then\r\nshe was a wonder of a child, to be sure, that could smile and chatter\r\nalready, and lay and listened when the clock struck on the wall. Her\r\nfather had chosen her name. It was his right; he was determined to\r\nhave his say--only trust to him! He had hesitated between Jacobine and\r\nRebecca, as being both sort of related to Isak; and at last he went to\r\nInger and asked timidly: "What d\'you think, now, of Rebecca?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes," said Inger.\r\n\r\nAnd when Isak heard that, he grew suddenly independent and master in\r\nhis own house. "If she\'s to have a name at all," he said sharply, "it\r\nshall be Rebecca! I\'ll see to that."\r\n\r\nAnd of course he was going with the party to church, partly to carry,\r\nand partly for propriety\'s sake. It would never do to let Rebecca go\r\nto be christened without a decent following! Isak trimmed his beard\r\nand put on a red shirt, as in his younger days; it was in the worst of\r\nthe hot weather, but he had a nice new winter suit, that looked well\r\non him, and he wore it. But for all that, Isak was not the man to make\r\na duty of finery and show; as now, for instance, he put on a pair of\r\nfabulously heavy boots for the march.\r\n\r\nSivert and Leopoldine stayed behind to look after the place.\r\n\r\nThen they rowed in a boat across the lake, and that was a deal easier\r\nthan before, when they had had to walk round all the way. But half-way\r\nacross, as Inger unfastened her dress to nurse the child, Isak noticed\r\nsomething bright hung in a string round her neck; whatever it might\r\nbe. And in the church he noticed that she wore that gold ring on her\r\nfinger. Oh, Inger--it had been too much for her after all!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nEleseus came home.\r\n\r\nHe had been away now for some years, and had grown taller than his\r\nfather, with long white hands and a little dark growth on his upper\r\nlip. He did not give himself airs, but seemed anxious to appear\r\nnatural and kindly; his mother, was surprised and pleased. He shared\r\nthe small bedroom with Sivert; the two brothers got on well together,\r\nand were constantly playing tricks on each other by way of amusement.\r\nBut, naturally, Eleseus had to take his share of the work in building\r\nthe house; and tired and miserable it made him, all unused as he was\r\nto bodily fatigue of any kind. It was worse still when Sivert had to\r\ngo off and leave it all to the other two; Eleseus then was almost more\r\nof a hindrance than a help.\r\n\r\nAnd where had Sivert gone off to? Why, \'twas Oline had come over the\r\nhills one day with word from Uncle Sivert that he was dying; and, of\r\ncourse, young Sivert had to go. A nice state of things all at once--it\r\ncouldn\'t have happened worse than to have Sivert running off just now.\r\nBut there was no help for it.\r\n\r\nSaid Oline: "I\'d no time to go running errands, and that\'s the truth;\r\nbut for all that ... I\'ve taken a fancy to the children here, all of\r\nthem, and little Sivert, and if as I could help him to his legacy...."\r\n\r\n"But was Uncle Sivert very bad, then?"\r\n\r\n"Bad? Heaven bless us, he\'s falling away day by day."\r\n\r\n"Was he in bed, then?"\r\n\r\n"In bed? How can you talk so light and flighty of death before God\'s\r\nJudgment-seat? Nay, he\'ll neither hop nor run again in this world,\r\nwill your Uncle Sivert."\r\n\r\nAll this seemed to mean that Uncle Sivert had not long to live, and\r\nInger insisted that little Sivert should set off at once.\r\n\r\nBut Uncle Sivert, incorrigible old knave, was not on his death-bed;\r\nwas not even confined to bed at all. When young Sivert came, he\r\nfound the little place in terrible muddle and disorder; they had not\r\nfinished the spring season\'s work properly yet--had not even carted\r\nout all the winter manure; but as for approaching death, there was no\r\nsign of it that he could see. Uncle Sivert was an old man now,\r\nover seventy; he was something of an invalid, and pottered about\r\nhalf-dressed in the house, and often kept his bed for a time. He\r\nneeded help on the place in many ways, as, for instance, with the\r\nherring nets that hung rotting in the sheds. Oh, but for all that he\r\nwas by no means at his last gasp; he could still eat sour fish and\r\nsmoke his pipe.\r\n\r\nWhen Sivert had been there half an hour and seen how things were, he\r\nwas for going back home again.\r\n\r\n"Home?" said the old man.\r\n\r\n"We\'re building a house, and father\'s none to help him properly."\r\n\r\n"Ho!" said his uncle. "Isn\'t Eleseus come home, then?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, but he\'s not used to the work."\r\n\r\n"Then why did you come at all?"\r\n\r\nSivert told him about Oline and her message, how she had said that\r\nUncle Sivert was on the point of death.\r\n\r\n"Point of death?" cried the old man. "Said I was on the point of\r\ndeath, did she? A cursed old fool!"\r\n\r\n"Ha ha ha!" said Sivert.\r\n\r\nThe old man looked sternly at him. "Eh? Laugh at a dying man, do you,\r\nand you called after me and all!"\r\n\r\nBut Sivert was too young to put on a graveyard face for that; he had\r\nnever cared much for his uncle. And now he wanted to get back home\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"Ho, so you thought so, too?" said the old man again. "Thought I was\r\nat my last gasp, and that fetched you, did it?"\r\n\r\n"\'Twas Oline said so," answered Sivert.\r\n\r\nHis uncle was silent for a while, then spoke again: "Look you here.\r\nIf you\'ll mend that net of mine and put it right, I\'ll show you\r\nsomething."\r\n\r\n"H\'m," said Sivert. "What is it?"\r\n\r\n"Well, never you mind," said the old man sullenly, and went to bed\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIt was going to be a long business, evidently. Sivert writhed\r\nuncomfortably. He went out and took a look round the place; everything\r\nwas shamefully neglected and uncared for; it was hopeless to begin\r\nwork here. When he came in after a while, his uncle was sitting up,\r\nwarming himself at the stove.\r\n\r\n"See that?" He pointed to an oak chest on the floor at his feet. It\r\nwas his money chest. As a matter of fact, it was a lined case made to\r\nhold bottles, such as visiting justices and other great folk used to\r\ncarry with them when travelling about the country in the old days,\r\nbut there were no bottles in it now; the old man had used it for his\r\ndocuments and papers as district treasurer; he kept his accounts and\r\nhis money in it now. The story ran that it was full of uncounted\r\nriches; the village folk would shake their heads and say: "Ah! if I\'d\r\nonly as much as lies in old Sivert his chest!"\r\n\r\nUncle Sivert took out a paper from the box and said solemnly: "You can\r\nread writing, I suppose?"\r\n\r\nLittle Sivert was not by any means a great hand at that, it is true,\r\nbut he made out so much as told him he was to inherit all that his\r\nuncle might leave at his death.\r\n\r\n"There," said the old man. "And now you can do as you please." And he\r\nlaid the paper back in the chest.\r\n\r\nSivert was not greatly impressed; after all, the paper told him no\r\nmore than he had known before; ever since he was a child he had heard\r\nsay that he was to have what Uncle Sivert left one day. A sight of the\r\ntreasure would be another matter.\r\n\r\n"There\'s some fine things in that chest, I doubt," said he.\r\n\r\n"There\'s more than you think," said the old man shortly.\r\n\r\nHe was angry and disappointed with his nephew; he locked up the box\r\nand went to bed again. There he lay, delivering jets of information.\r\n"I\'ve been district treasurer and warden of the public moneys in this\r\nvillage over thirty year; _I\'ve_ no need to beg and pray for a helping\r\nhand from any man! Who told Oline, I\'d like to know, that I was on my\r\ndeathbed? I can send three men, carriage and cart to fetch a doctor if\r\nI want one. Don\'t try your games with me, young man! Can\'t even wait\r\ntill I\'m gone, it seems. I\'ve shown you the document and you\'ve seen\r\nit, and it\'s there in the chest--that\'s all I\'ve got to say. But\r\nif you go running off and leave me now, you can just carry word to\r\nEleseus and tell _him_ to come. He\'s not named after me and called by\r\nmy earthly name--let _him_ come."\r\n\r\nBut for all the threatening tone, Sivert only thought a moment, and\r\nsaid: "Ay, I\'ll tell Eleseus to come."\r\n\r\nOline was still at Sellanraa when Sivert got back. She had found time\r\nto pay a visit lower down, to Axel Stroem and Barbro on their place,\r\nand came back full of mysteries and whisperings. "That girl Barbro\'s\r\nfilling out a deal of late--Lord knows what it may mean. But not a\r\nword that I\'ve said so! And here\'s Sivert back again? No need to ask\r\nwhat news, I suppose? Your Uncle Sivert\'s passed away? Ay, well, an\r\nold man he was and an aged one, on the brink of the grave. What--not\r\ndead? Well, well, we\'ve much to be thankful for, and that\'s a solemn\r\nword! Me talking nonsense, you say? Oh, if I\'d never more to answer\r\nfor! How was I to know your uncle he was lying there a sham and a\r\nfalse pretender before the Lord? Not long to live, that\'s what I said.\r\nAnd I\'ll hold by it, when the time comes, before the Throne. What\'s\r\nthat you say? Well, and wasn\'t he lying there his very self in his\r\nbed, and folding his hands on his breast and saying \'twould soon be\r\nover?"\r\n\r\nThere was no arguing with Oline, she bewildered her adversaries with\r\ntalk and cast them down. When she learned that Uncle Sivert had sent\r\nfor Eleseus, she grasped at that too, and made her own advantage of\r\nit: "There you are, and see if I was talking nonsense. Here\'s old\r\nSivert calling up his kinsfolk and longing for a sight of his own\r\nflesh and blood; ay, he\'s nearing his end! You can\'t refuse him,\r\nEleseus; off with you at once this minute and see your uncle while\r\nthere\'s life in him. I\'m going that way too, we\'ll go together."\r\n\r\nOline did not leave Sellanraa without taking Inger aside for more\r\nwhisperings of Barbro. "Not a word I\'ve said--but I could see the\r\nsigns of it! And now I suppose she\'ll be wife and all on the farm\r\nthere. Ay, there\'s some folk are born to great things, for all they\r\nmay be small as the sands of the sea in their beginnings. And who\'d\r\nhave ever thought it of that girl Barbro! Axel, yes, never doubt but\r\nhe\'s a toiling sort and getting on, and great fine lands and means and\r\nall like you\'ve got here--\'tis more than we know of over on our side\r\nthe hills, as you know\'s a true word, Inger, being born and come of\r\nthe place yourself. Barbro, she\'d a trifle of wool in a chest; \'twas\r\nnaught but winter wool, and I wasn\'t asking and she never offered me.\r\nWe said but _Goddag_ and _Farvel_, for all that I\'d known her from she\r\nwas a toddling child all that time I was here at Sellanraa by reason\r\nof you being away and learning knowledge at the Institute...."\r\n\r\n"There\'s Rebecca crying," said Inger, breaking in on Oline. But she\r\ngave her a handful of wool.\r\n\r\nThen a great thanksgiving speech from Oline: ay, wasn\'t it just as she\r\nhad said to Barbro herself of Inger, and how there was not her like\r\nto be found for giving to folk; ay, she\'d give till she was bare, and\r\ngive her fingers to the bone, and never complain. Ay, go in and see to\r\nthe sweet angel, and never was there a child in the world so like her\r\nmother as Rebecca--no. Did Inger remember how she\'d said one day as\r\nshe\'d never have children again? Ah, now she could see! No, better\r\ngive ear to them as were grown old and had borne children of their\r\nown, for who should fathom the Lord His ways, said Oline.\r\n\r\nAnd with that she padded off after Eleseus up through the forest,\r\nshrunken with age, grey and abject, and for ever nosing after things,\r\nimperishable. Going to old Sivert now, to let him know how she, Oline,\r\nhad managed to persuade Eleseus to come.\r\n\r\nBut Eleseus had needed no persuading, there was no difficulty there.\r\nFor, look you, Eleseus had turned out better, after all, than he\'d\r\nbegun; a decent lad in his way, kindly and easy-going from a child,\r\nonly nothing great in the way of bodily strength. It was not without\r\nreason he had been unwilling to come home this time; he knew well\r\nenough that his mother had been in prison for child-murder; he had\r\nnever heard a word about it there in the town, but at home in the\r\nvillage every one would remember. And it was not for nothing he had\r\nbeen living with companions of another sort. He had grown to be more\r\nsensitive and finer feeling than ever before. He knew that a fork was\r\nreally just as necessary as a knife. As a man of business, he used the\r\nterms of the new coinage, whereas, out in the wilds, men still counted\r\nmoney by the ancient _Daler_. Ay, he was not unwilling to walk across\r\nthe hills to other parts; here, at home, he was constantly forced to\r\nkeep down his own superiority. He tried his best to adapt himself to\r\nthe others, and he managed well; but it was always having to be on his\r\nguard. As, for instance, when he had first come back to Sellanraa\r\na couple of weeks ago, he had brought with him his light spring\r\novercoat, though it was midsummer; and when he hung it up on a nail,\r\nhe might just as well have turned it so as to show the silver plate\r\ninside with his initials, but he didn\'t. And the same with his\r\nstick--his walking-stick. True, it was only an umbrella stick really,\r\nthat he had dismantled and taken the framework off; but here he had\r\nnot used it as he did in town, swinging it about--only carried it\r\nhidden against his thigh.\r\n\r\nNo, it was not surprising that Eleseus went across the hills. He was\r\nno good at building houses; he was good at writing with letters, a\r\nthing not every one could do, but here at home there was no one in all\r\nthe place that set any store by the art of it save perhaps his mother.\r\nHe set off gaily through the woods, far ahead of Oline; he could wait\r\nfor her farther up. He ran like a calf; he hurried. Eleseus had in a\r\nway stolen off from the farm; he was afraid of being seen. For,\r\nto tell the truth, he had taken with him both spring coat and\r\nwalking-stick for the journey. Over on the other side there might be a\r\nchance of seeing people, and being seen himself; he might even be able\r\nto go to church. And so he sweated happily under the weight of an\r\nunnecessary spring coat in the heat of the sun.\r\n\r\nThey did not miss him at the building, far from it. Isak had Sivert\r\nback again, and Sivert was worth a host of his brother at that work;\r\nhe could keep at it from morning to night. It did not take them\r\nlong to get the framework up; it was only three walls, as they were\r\nbuilding out from the other. And they had less trouble with the\r\ntimber; they could cut their planks at the sawmill, which gave them\r\nthe outside pieces for roofing at the same time. And one fine day\r\nthere was the house all finished, before their eyes, roofed, floored,\r\nand with the windows in. They had no time for more than this between\r\nthe seasons; the boarding and painting would have to wait.\r\n\r\nAnd now came Geissler with a great following across the hills from\r\nSweden. And the men with him rode on horseback with glossy-coated\r\nhorses and yellow saddles; rich travellers they must be no doubt;\r\nstout, heavy men; the horses bowed under their weight. And among all\r\nthese great personages came Geissler on foot. Four gentlemen and\r\nGeissler made up the party, and then there were a couple of servants\r\neach leading a packhorse.\r\n\r\nThe riders dismounted outside the farm, and Geissler said: "Here\'s\r\nIsak--here\'s the Margrave of the place himself. _Goddag_, Isak! I\'ve\r\ncome back again, you see, as I said I would."\r\n\r\nGeissler was the same as ever. For all that he came on foot, his\r\nmanner showed no consciousness of inferiority to the rest; ay, his\r\nthreadbare coat hung long and wretched-looking down over his shrunken\r\nback, but he put on a grand enough air for all that. He even\r\nsaid: "We\'re going up into the hills a bit, these gentlemen and\r\nmyself--it\'ll do them good to get their weight down a bit."\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen themselves were nice and pleasant enough; they smiled\r\nat Geissler\'s words, and hoped Isak would excuse their coming rioting\r\nover his land like this. They had brought their own provisions, and\r\ndid not propose to eat him out of house and home, but they would be\r\nglad of a roof over their heads for the night. Perhaps he could put\r\nthem up in the new building there?\r\n\r\nWhen they had rested a while, and Geissler had been inside with Inger\r\nand the children, the whole party went up into the hills and stayed\r\nout till evening. Now and again in the course of the afternoon, the\r\nfolks at Sellanraa could hear an unusually heavy report from the\r\ndistance, and the train of them came down with new bags of samples.\r\n"Blue copper," they said, nodding at the ore. They talked long and\r\nlearnedly, and consulting a sort of map they had drawn; there was an\r\nengineer among them, and a mining expert; one appeared to be a big\r\nlandowner or manager of works. They talked of aerial railways and\r\ncable traction. Geissler threw in a word here and there, and each time\r\nas if advising them; they paid great attention to what he said.\r\n\r\n"Who owns the land south of the lake?" one of them asked Isak.\r\n\r\n"The State," answered Geissler quickly. He was wide awake and sharp,\r\nand held in his hand the document Isak had once signed with his mark.\r\n"I told you before--the State," he said. "No need to ask again. If you\r\ndon\'t believe me, you can find out for yourself if you please."\r\n\r\nLater in the evening, Geissler took Isak aside and said: "Look here,\r\nshall we sell that copper mine?"\r\n\r\nSaid Isak: "Why, as to that, \'twas so that Lensmand bought it of me\r\nonce, and paid for it."\r\n\r\n"True," said Geissler. "I bought the ground. But then there was a\r\nprovision that you were to have a percentage of receipts from working\r\nor sale; are you willing to dispose of your share?"\r\n\r\nThis was more than Isak could understand, and Geissler had to explain.\r\nIsak could not work a mine, being a farmer and a clearer of forest\r\nland; Geissler himself couldn\'t run a mine either. Money, capital? Ho,\r\nas much as he wanted, never fear! But he hadn\'t the time, too many\r\nthings to do, always running about the country, attending to his\r\nproperty in the south, his property in the north. And now Geissler was\r\nthinking of selling out to these Swedish gentlemen here; they were\r\nrelatives of his wife, all of them, and rich men. "Do you see what I\r\nmean?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do it what way you please," said Isak.\r\n\r\nA strange thing--this complete confidence seemed to comfort Geissler\r\nwonderfully in his threadbareness. "Well, I\'m not sure it\'s the best\r\nthing you could do," he said thoughtfully. Then suddenly he was\r\ncertain, and went on: "But if you\'ll give me a free hand to act on\r\nmy discretion, I can do better for you at any rate than you could by\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"H\'m," began Isak. "You\'ve always been a good man to us all here...."\r\n\r\nBut Geissler frowned at that, and cut him short: "All right, then."\r\n\r\nNext morning the gentlemen sat down to write. It was a serious\r\nbusiness; there was first of all a contract for forty thousand\r\n_Kroner_ for the sale of the mine, then a document whereby Geissler\r\nmade over the whole of the money to his wife and children. Isak and\r\nSivert were called in to witness the signatures to these. When it\r\nwas done, the gentlemen wanted to buy over Isak\'s percentage for a\r\nridiculous sum--five hundred _Kroner_. Geissler put a stop to that,\r\nhowever. "Jesting apart," he said.\r\n\r\nIsak himself understood but little of the whole affair; he had sold\r\nthe place once, and got his money. But in any case, he did not care\r\nmuch about _Kroner_--it was not real money like _Daler_. Sivert, on\r\nthe other hand, followed the business with more understanding.\r\nThere was something peculiar, he thought, about the tone of these\r\nnegotiations; it looked very much like a family affair between the\r\nparties. One of the strangers would say: "My dear Geissler, you ought\r\nnot to have such red eyes, you know." Whereto Geissler answered\r\nsharply, if evasively: "No, I ought not, I know. But we don\'t all get\r\nwhat we ought to in this world!"\r\n\r\nIt looked very much as if Fru Geissler\'s brothers and kinsmen were\r\ntrying to buy off her husband, secure themselves against his visits\r\nfor the future, and get quit of a troublesome relation. As to the\r\nmine, it was worth something in itself, no doubt, no one denied it;\r\nbut it lay far out of the way, and the buyers themselves said they\r\nwere only taking it over in order to sell it again to some one better\r\nin a position to work it. There was nothing unreasonable in that. They\r\ndeclared too, quite frankly, that they had no idea what they would be\r\nable to get for it as it stood; if it were taken up and worked, then\r\nthe forty thousand might turn out to be only a fraction of what it was\r\nworth; if it were allowed to lie there as it was, the money was simply\r\nthrown away. But in any case, they wanted to have a clear title,\r\nwithout encumbrance, and therefore they offered Isak five hundred\r\n_Kroner_ for his share.\r\n\r\n"I\'m acting on his behalf," said Geissler, "and I\'m not going to sell\r\nout his share for less than ten per cent. of the purchase-money."\r\n\r\n"Four thousand!" said the others.\r\n\r\n"Four thousand," said Geissler. "The land was his, and his share comes\r\nto four thousand. It wasn\'t mine, and I get forty thousand. Kindly\r\nturn that over in your minds, if you please."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but--four thousand _Kroner_!"\r\n\r\nGeissler rose from his place, and said: "That, or no sale."\r\n\r\nThey thought it over, whispered about it, went out into the yard,\r\ntalking as long as they could. "Get the horses ready," they called to\r\nthe servants. One of the gentlemen went in to Inger and paid royally\r\nfor coffee, a few eggs, and their lodging. Geissler walked about with\r\na careless air, but he was wide awake all the same.\r\n\r\n"How did that irrigation work turn out last year?" he asked Sivert.\r\n\r\n"It saved the whole crop."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve cut away that mound there since I was here last, what?"\r\n\r\n"Ay."\r\n\r\n"You must have another horse on the farm," said Geissler. He noticed\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nOne of the strangers came up. "Now then, let\'s get this matter settled\r\nand have done with it," he said.\r\n\r\nThey all went into the new building again, and Isak\'s four thousand\r\n_Kroner_ were counted out. Geissler was given a paper, which he\r\nthrust into his pocket as if it were of no value at all. "Keep that\r\ncarefully," they told him, "and in a few days your wife shall have the\r\nbankbook sent."\r\n\r\nGeissler puckered his forehead and said shortly: "Very good."\r\n\r\nBut they were not finished with Geissler yet. Not that he opened his\r\nmouth to ask for anything; he simply stood there, and they saw how he\r\nstood there: maybe he had stipulated beforehand for a trifle on his\r\nown account. The leader gave him a bundle of notes, and Geissler\r\nsimply nodded again, and said: "Very good."\r\n\r\n"And now I think we ought to drink a glass with Geissler," said the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThey drank, and that was done. And then they took leave of Geissler.\r\n\r\nJust at that moment came Brede Olsen walking up. Now what did he want?\r\nBrede had doubtless heard the reports of the blasting charges the day\r\nbefore, and understood that there was something on foot in the way\r\nof mines. And now he came up ready to sell something too. He walked\r\nstraight past Geissler, and addressed himself to the gentlemen; he\r\nhad found some remarkable specimens of rock hereabouts, quite\r\nextraordinary, some blood-like, others like silver; he knew every\r\ncranny and corner in the hills around and could go straight to every\r\nspot; he knew of long veins of some heavy metal--whatever it might be.\r\n\r\n"Have you any samples?" asked the mining expert.\r\n\r\nYes, Brede had samples. But couldn\'t they just as well go up and look\r\nat the places at once? It wasn\'t far. Samples--oh, sacks of them,\r\nwhole packing-cases full. No, he had not brought them with him, they\r\nwere at home--he could run down and fetch them. But it would be\r\nquicker just to run up into the hills and fetch some more, if they\r\nwould only wait.\r\n\r\nThe men shook their heads and went on their way.\r\n\r\nBrede looked after them with an injured air. If he had felt a glimmer\r\nof hope for the moment, it was gone now; fate was against him, nothing\r\never went right. Well for Brede that he was not easily cast down; he\r\nlooked after the men as they rode away, and said at last: "Wish you a\r\npleasant journey!" And that was all.\r\n\r\nBut now he was humble again in his manner towards Geissler, his former\r\nchief, and no longer treated him as an equal, but used forms of\r\nrespect. Geissler had taken out his pocket-book on some pretext or\r\nother, and any one could see that it was stuffed full of notes.\r\n\r\n"If only Lensmand could help me a bit," said Brede.\r\n\r\n"Go back home and work your land properly," said Geissler, and helped\r\nhim not a bit.\r\n\r\n"I might easily have brought up a whole barrow-load of samples, but\r\nwouldn\'t it have been easier to go up and look at the place itself\r\nwhile they were here?"\r\n\r\nGeissler took no notice of him, and turned to Isak: "Did you see what\r\nI did with that document? It was a most important thing--a matter\r\nof several thousand _Kroner_. Oh, here it is, in among a bundle of\r\nnotes."\r\n\r\n"Who were those people?" asked Brede. "Just out for a ride, or what?"\r\n\r\nGeissler had been having an anxious time, no doubt, and now he cooled\r\ndown. But he had still something of life and eagerness in him, enough\r\nto do a little more; he went up into the hills with Sivert, and took a\r\nbig sheet of paper with him, and drew a map of the ground south of the\r\nlake--Heaven knows what he had in mind. When he came down to the farm\r\nsome hours later, Brede was still there, but Geissler took no notice\r\nof his questions; Geissler was tired, and waved him aside.\r\n\r\nHe slept like a stone till next morning early, then he rose with the\r\nsun, and was himself again. "Sellanraa," said he, standing outside and\r\nlooking all round.\r\n\r\n"All that money," said Isak; "does it mean I\'m to have it all?"\r\n\r\n"All?" said Geissler. "Heavens, man, can\'t you see it ought to have\r\nbeen ever so much more? And it was my business really to pay you,\r\naccording to our contract; but you saw how things were--it was the\r\nonly way to manage it. What did you get? Only a thousand _Daler_,\r\naccording to the old reckoning. I\'ve been thinking, you\'ll need\r\nanother horse on the place now."\r\n\r\n"Ay."\r\n\r\n"Well, I know of one. That fellow Heyerdahl\'s assistant, he\'s letting\r\nhis place go to rack and ruin; takes more interest in running about\r\nselling folk up. He\'s sold a deal of his stock already, and he\'ll be\r\nwilling to sell the horse."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll see him about it," said Isak.\r\n\r\nGeissler waved his hand broadly around, and said: "Margrave,\r\nlandowner--that\'s you! House and stock and cultivated land--they can\'t\r\nstarve you out if they try!"\r\n\r\n"No," said Isak. "We\'ve all we could wish for that the Lord ever\r\nmade."\r\n\r\nGeissler went fussing about the place, and suddenly slipped in to\r\nInger. "Could you manage a bit of food for me to take along again?" he\r\nasked. "Just a few wafers--no butter and cheese; there\'s good things\r\nenough in them already. No, do as I say; I can\'t carry more."\r\n\r\nOut again. Geissler was restless, he went into the new building and\r\nsat down to write. He had thought it all out beforehand, and it did\r\nnot take long now to get it down. Sending in an application to the\r\nState, he explained loftily to Isak--"to the Ministry of the Interior,\r\nyou understand. Yes, I\'ve no end of things to look after all at once."\r\n\r\nWhen he had got his parcel of food and had taken leave, he seemed to\r\nremember something all of a sudden: "Oh, by the way, I\'m afraid I owe\r\nyou something from last time--I took out a note from my pocket-book on\r\npurpose, and then stuck it in my waistcoat pocket--I found it there\r\nafterwards. Too many things to think about all at once...." He put\r\nsomething into Inger\'s hand and off he went.\r\n\r\nAy, off went Geissler, bravely enough to all seeming. Nothing downcast\r\nnor anyway nearing his end; he came to Sellanraa again after, and it\r\nwas long years before he died. Each time he went away the Sellanraa\r\nfolk missed him as a friend. Isak had been thinking of asking him\r\nabout Breidablik, getting his advice, but nothing came of it. And\r\nmaybe Geissler would have dissuaded him there; have thought it a risky\r\nthing to buy up land for cultivation and give it to Eleseus; to a\r\nclerk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nUncle Sivert died after all. Eleseus spent three weeks looking after\r\nhim, and then the old man died. Eleseus arranged the funeral, and\r\nmanaged things very well; got hold of a fuchsia or so from the\r\ncottages round, and borrowed a flag to hoist at half-mast, and bought\r\nsome black stuff from the store for lowered blinds. Isak and Inger\r\nwere sent for, and came to the burial. Eleseus acted as host, and\r\nserved out refreshments to the guests; ay, and when the body was\r\ncarried out, and they had sung a hymn, Eleseus actually said a few\r\nsuitable words over the coffin, and his mother was so proud and\r\ntouched that she had to use her handkerchief. Everything went off\r\nsplendidly.\r\n\r\nThen on the way home with his father, Eleseus had to carry that spring\r\ncoat of his openly, though he managed to hide the stick in one of the\r\nsleeves. All went well till they had to cross the water in a boat;\r\nthen his father sat down unexpectedly on the coat, and there was a\r\ncrack. "What was that?" asked Isak.\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing," said Eleseus.\r\n\r\nBut he did not throw the broken stick away; as soon as they got home,\r\nhe set about looking for a bit of tube or something to mend it with.\r\n"We\'ll fix it all right," said Sivert, the incorrigible. "Look here,\r\nget a good stout splint of wood on either side, and lash all fast with\r\nwaxed thread...."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll lash you with waxed thread," said Eleseus.\r\n\r\n"Ha ha ha! Well, perhaps you\'d rather tie it up neatly with a red\r\ngarter?"\r\n\r\n"Ha ha ha," said Eleseus himself at that; but he went in to his\r\nmother, and got her to give him an old thimble, filed off the end, and\r\nmade quite a fine ferrule. Oh, Eleseus was not so helpless after all,\r\nwith his long, white hands.\r\n\r\nThe brothers teased each other as much as ever. "Am I to have what\r\nUncle Sivert\'s left?" asked Eleseus.\r\n\r\n"You have it? How much is it?" asked Sivert.\r\n\r\n"Ha ha ha, you want to know how much it is first, you old miser!"\r\n\r\n"Well, you can have it, anyway," said Sivert.\r\n\r\n"It\'s between five and ten thousand."\r\n\r\n"_Daler_?" cried Sivert; he couldn\'t help it.\r\n\r\nNow Eleseus never reckoned in _Daler_, but he didn\'t like to say no at\r\nthe time, so he just nodded, and left it at that till next day.\r\n\r\nThen he took up the matter again. "Aren\'t you sorry you gave me all\r\nthat yesterday?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Woodenhead! Of course not," said Sivert. That was what he said,\r\nbut--well, five thousand _Daler_ was five thousand _Daler_, and no\r\nlittle sum; if his brother were anything but a lousy Indian savage, he\r\nought to give back half.\r\n\r\n"Well, to tell the truth," explained Eleseus, "I don\'t reckon to get\r\nfat on that legacy, after all."\r\n\r\nSivert looked at him in astonishment. "Ho, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"No, nothing special, that is to say. Not what you might call _par\r\nexcellence_."\r\n\r\nEleseus had some notions of accounts, of course, and Uncle Sivert\'s\r\nmoney-chest, the famous bottle-case, had been opened and examined\r\nwhile he was there; he had had to go through all the accounts and make\r\nup a balance sheet. Uncle Sivert had not set this nephew to work on\r\nthe fields or mending of herring nets; he had initiated him into a\r\ncomplex muddle of figures, the weirdest book-keeping ever seen. If a\r\nman had paid his taxes some years back in kind, with a goat, say, or\r\na load of dried cod, there was neither flesh nor fish to show for it\r\nnow; but old Sivert searched his memory and said, "He\'s paid!"\r\n\r\n"Right, then we\'ll cross him out," said Sivert.\r\n\r\nEleseus was the man for this sort of work; he was bright and quick,\r\nand encouraged the invalid by assuring him that things were all right;\r\nthe two had got on well together, even to jesting at times. Eleseus\r\nwas a bit of a fool, perhaps, in some things, but so was his uncle;\r\nand the two of them sat there drawing up elaborate documents in favour\r\nnot only of little Sivert but also to benefit the village, the commune\r\nwhich the old man had served for thirty years. Oh, they were grand\r\ndays! "I couldn\'t have got a better man to help with all this than\r\nyou, Eleseus boy," said Uncle Sivert. He sent out and bought mutton,\r\nin the middle of the summer; fish was brought up fresh from the sea,\r\nEleseus being ordered to pay cash from the chest. They lived well\r\nenough. They got hold of Oline--they couldn\'t have found a better\r\nperson to invite to a feast, nor one more sure to spread abroad the\r\nnews of Uncle Sivert\'s greatness to the end. And the satisfaction was\r\nmutual. "We must do something for Oline, too," said Uncle Sivert, "she\r\nbeing a widow and not well off. There\'ll be enough for little Sivert,\r\nanyhow." Eleseus managed it with a few strokes of the pen; a mere\r\ncodicil to the last will and testament, and lo, Oline was also a\r\nsharer in the inheritance.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll look after you," said Uncle Sivert to her. "If so be I shouldn\'t\r\nget better this time and get about again on earth I\'ll take care\r\nyou\'re not left out." Oline declared that she was speechless, but\r\nspeechless she was not; she wept and was touched to the heart and\r\ngrateful; there was none to compare with Oline for finding the\r\nimmediate connection between a worldly gift and being "repaid a\r\nthousandfold eternally in the world to come." No, speechless she was\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nBut Eleseus? At first, perhaps, he may have taken a bright enough view\r\nof his uncle\'s affairs, but after a while he began to think things\r\nover and talk as well. He tried at first with a slight hint: "The\r\naccounts aren\'t exactly as they should be," he said.\r\n\r\n"Well, never mind that," said the old man. "There\'ll be enough and to\r\nspare when I\'m gone."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve money outstanding besides, maybe?" said Eleseus. "In a bank,\r\nor so?" For so report had said.\r\n\r\n"H\'m," said the old man. "That\'s as it may be. But, anyhow, with the\r\nfishery, the farm and buildings and stock, red cows and white cows and\r\nall--don\'t you worry about that, Eleseus, my boy."\r\n\r\nEleseus had no idea what the fishery business might be worth, but\r\nhe had seen the live stock; it consisted of one cow, partly red and\r\npartly white. Uncle Sivert must have been delirious. Some of the\r\naccounts, too, were difficult to make out at all; they were a muddle,\r\na bare jumble of figures, especially from the date when the coinage\r\nwas changed; the district treasurer had frequently reckoned the small\r\n_Kroner_ as if they were full _Daler_. No wonder he fancied himself\r\nrich! But when everything was reduced to something like order, Eleseus\r\nfeared there would not be much left over. Perhaps not enough to settle\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nAy, Sivert might easily promise him all that came to him from his\r\nuncle!\r\n\r\nThe two brothers jested about it. Sivert was not upset over the\r\nmatter, not at all; perhaps, indeed, it might have irked him something\r\nmore if he really had thrown away five thousand _Daler_. He knew well\r\nenough that it had been a mere speculation, naming him after his\r\nuncle; he had no claim to anything there. And now he pressed Eleseus\r\nto take what there was. "It\'s to be yours, of course," said he. "Come\r\nalong, let\'s get it set down in writing. I\'d like to see you a rich\r\nman. Don\'t be too proud to take it!"\r\n\r\nAy, they had many a laugh together. Sivert, indeed, was the one that\r\nhelped most to keep Eleseus at home; it would have been much harder\r\nbut for him.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Eleseus was getting rather spoiled again; the\r\nthree weeks\' idling on the other side of the hills had not done him\r\nany good. He had also been to church there, and made a show; ay, he\r\nhad even met some girls there. Here at Sellanraa there was nothing of\r\nthat sort; Jensine, the servant-maid, was a mere nothing, a worker and\r\nno more, rather suited to Sivert.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve a fancy to see how that girl Barbro from Breidablik turned out\r\nnow she\'s grown up," said Eleseus one day.\r\n\r\n"Well, go down to Axel Stroem\'s place and see," said Sivert.\r\n\r\nEleseus went down one Sunday. Ay, he had been away, gained confidence\r\nand high spirits once more; he had tasted excitement of a sort, and he\r\nmade things livelier at Axel\'s little place. Barbro herself was by no\r\nmeans to be despised; at any rate she was the only one anywhere near.\r\nShe played the guitar and talked readily; moreover, she did not smell\r\nof tansy, but of real scent, the sort you buy in shops. Eleseus, on\r\nhis part, let it be understood that he was only home for a holiday,\r\nand would soon be called back to the office again. But it was not so\r\nbad being at home after all, in the old place, and, of course, he had\r\nthe little bedroom to live in. But it was not like being in town!\r\n\r\n"Nay, that\'s a true word," said Barbro, "Town\'s very different from\r\nthis."\r\n\r\nAxel himself was altogether out of it with these two town-folk; he\r\nfound it dull with them, and preferred to go out and look over his\r\nland. The pair of them were left to do as they liked, and Eleseus\r\nmanaged things grandly. He told how he had been over to the\r\nneighbouring village to bury his uncle, and did not forget to mention\r\nthe speech he had made over the coffin.\r\n\r\nWhen he took his leave, he asked Barbro to go part of the way home\r\nwith him. But Barbro, thank you, was not inclined that way.\r\n\r\n"Is that the way they do things where you\'ve been," she asked--"for\r\nthe ladies to escort the gentlemen home?"\r\n\r\nThat was a nasty hit for Eleseus; he turned red, and understood he had\r\noffended her.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he went down to Maaneland again next Sunday, and this\r\ntime he took his stick. They talked as before, and Axel was out of it\r\naltogether, as before. "\'Tis a big place your father\'s got," said he.\r\n"And building again, now, it seems."\r\n\r\n"Ay, it\'s all very well for him," said Eleseus, anxious to show off\r\na little. "He can afford it. It\'s another matter with poor folk like\r\nourselves."\r\n\r\n"How d\'you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, haven\'t you heard? There\'s been some Swedish millionaires came\r\ndown the other day and bought a mine of him, a copper mine."\r\n\r\n"Why, you don\'t say? And he\'ll have got a heap of money for it, then?"\r\n\r\n"Enormous. Well, I don\'t want to boast, but it was at any rate ever\r\nso many thousands. What was I going to say? Build? You\'ve a deal of\r\ntimber lying about here yourself. When are you going to start?"\r\n\r\nBarbro put in her word here: "Never!"\r\n\r\nNow that was pure exaggeration and impertinence. Axel had got his\r\nstones the autumn before, and carted them home that winter; now,\r\nbetween seasons, he had got the foundation walls done, and cellar and\r\nall else--all that remained was to build the timbered part above. He\r\nwas hoping to get part of it roofed in this autumn, and had thought\r\nof asking Sivert to lend him a hand for a few days--what did Eleseus\r\nthink of that?\r\n\r\nEleseus thought like as not. "But why not ask me?" he said, smiling.\r\n\r\n"You?" said Axel, and he spoke with sudden respect at the idea.\r\n"You\'ve talents for other things than that, I take it."\r\n\r\nOh, but it was pleasant to find oneself appreciated here in the wilds!\r\n"Why, I\'m afraid my hands aren\'t much good at that sort of work," said\r\nEleseus delicately.\r\n\r\n"Let me look," said Barbro, and took his hand.\r\n\r\nAxel dropped out of the conversation again, and went out, leaving the\r\ntwo of them alone. They were of an age, had been to school together,\r\nand played and kissed each other and raced about; and now, with a\r\nfine disdainful carelessness, they talked of old times--exchanging\r\nreminiscences--and Barbro, perhaps, was inclined to show off a little\r\nbefore her companion. True, this Eleseus was not like the really fine\r\nyoung men in offices, that wore glasses and gold watches and so on,\r\nbut he could pass for a gentleman here in the wilds, there was\r\nno denying that. And she took out her photograph now and showed\r\nhim--that\'s what she looked like then--"all different now, of course."\r\nAnd Barbro sighed.\r\n\r\n"Why, what\'s the matter with you now?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think I\'ve changed for the worse since then?"\r\n\r\n"Changed for the worse, indeed! Well, I don\'t mind telling you you\'re\r\never so much prettier now," said he, "filled out all round. For the\r\nworse? Ho! That\'s a fine idea!"\r\n\r\n"But it\'s a nice dress, don\'t you think? Cut open just a bit front and\r\nback. And then I had that silver chain you see there, and it cost a\r\nheap of money, too; it was a present from one of the young clerks I\r\nwas with then. But I lost it. Not exactly lost it, you know, but I\r\nwanted money to come home."\r\n\r\nEleseus asked: "Can I have the photo to keep?"\r\n\r\n"To keep? H\'m. What\'ll you give me for it?"\r\n\r\nOh, Eleseus knew well enough what he wanted to say, but he dared not.\r\n"I\'ll have mine taken when I go back to town," he said instead, "and\r\nsend it you."\r\n\r\nBarbro put away the photograph. "No, it\'s the only one I\'ve left."\r\n\r\nThat was a stroke of darkness to his young heart, and he stretched out\r\nhis hand towards the picture.\r\n\r\n"Well, give me something for it, now," she said, laughing. And at that\r\nhe up and kissed her properly.\r\n\r\nAfter that it was easier all round; Eleseus brightened up, and got\r\non finely. They flirted and joked and laughed, and were excellent\r\nfriends. "When you took my hand just now it was like a bit of swan\'s\r\ndown--yours, I mean."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'ll be going back to town again, and never come back here,\r\nI\'ll be bound," said Barbro.\r\n\r\n"Do you think I\'m that sort?" said Eleseus.\r\n\r\n"Ah, I dare say there\'s a somebody there you\'re fond of."\r\n\r\n"No, there isn\'t. Between you and me, I\'m not engaged at all," said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, you are; I know."\r\n\r\n"No, solemn fact, I\'m not."\r\n\r\nThey carried on like this quite a while; Eleseus was plainly in love.\r\n"I\'ll write to you," said he. "May I?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said she.\r\n\r\n"For I wouldn\'t be mean enough if you didn\'t care about it, you\r\nknow." And suddenly he was jealous, and asked: "I\'ve heard say you\'re\r\npromised to Axel here; is it true?"\r\n\r\n"Axel?" she said scornfully, and he brightened up again. "I\'ll see him\r\nfarther!" But then she turned penitent, and added: "Alex, he\'s good\r\nenough for me, though.... And he takes in a paper all for me to read,\r\nand gives me things now and again--lots of things. I will say that"\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course," Eleseus agreed. "He may be an excellent fellow in his\r\nway, but that\'s not everything...."\r\n\r\nBut the thought of Axel seemed to have made Barbro anxious; she got\r\nup, and said to Eleseus: "You\'ll have to go now; I must see to the\r\nanimals."\r\n\r\nNext Sunday Eleseus went down a good deal later than usual, and\r\ncarried the letter himself. It was a letter! A whole week of\r\nexcitement, all the trouble it had cost him to write, but here it\r\nwas at last; he had managed to produce a letter: "To Froeken Barbro\r\nBredesen. It is two or three times now I have had the inexpressible\r\ndelight of seeing you again...."\r\n\r\nComing so late as he did now, Barbro must at any rate have finished\r\nseeing to the animals, and might perhaps have gone to bed already.\r\nThat wouldn\'t matter--quite the reverse, indeed.\r\n\r\nBut Barbro was up, sitting in the hut. She looked now as if she had\r\nsuddenly lost all idea of being nice to him and making love--Eleseus\r\nfancied Axel had perhaps got hold of her and warned her.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s the letter I promised you," he said.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said she, and opened it, and read it through without\r\nseeming much moved. "I wish I could write as nice a hand as that," she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nEleseus was disappointed. What had he done--what was the matter with\r\nher? And where was Axel? He was not there. Beginning to get tired of\r\nthese foolish Sunday visits, perhaps, and preferred to stay away; or\r\nhe might have had some business to keep him over, when he went down to\r\nthe village the day before. Anyhow, he was not there.\r\n\r\n"What d\'you want to sit here in this stuffy old place for on a lovely\r\nevening?" asked Eleseus. "Come out for a walk."\r\n\r\n"I\'m waiting for Axel," she answered.\r\n\r\n"Axel? Can\'t you live without Axel, then?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. But he\'ll want something to eat when he comes back."\r\n\r\nTime went, time dribbled away, they came no nearer each other; Barbro\r\nwas as cross and contrary as ever. He tried telling her again of his\r\nvisit across the hills, and did not forget about the speech he had\r\nmade: "\'Twasn\'t much I had to say, but all the same it brought out the\r\ntears from some of them."\r\n\r\n"Did it?" said she.\r\n\r\n"And then one Sunday I went to church."\r\n\r\n"What news there?"\r\n\r\n"News? Oh, nothing. Only to have a look round. Not much of a priest,\r\nas far as I know anything about it; no sort of manner, he had."\r\n\r\nTime went.\r\n\r\n"What d\'you think Axel\'d say if he found you here this evening again?"\r\nsaid Barbro suddenly.\r\n\r\nThere was a thing to say! It was as if she had struck him. Had she\r\nforgotten all about last time? Hadn\'t they agreed that he was to come\r\nthis evening? Eleseus was deeply hurt, and murmured: "I can go, if you\r\nlike. What have I done?" he asked then, his lips trembling. He was in\r\ndistress, in trouble, that was plain to see.\r\n\r\n"Done? Oh, you haven\'t done anything."\r\n\r\n"Well, what\'s the matter with you, anyway, this evening?"\r\n\r\n"With me? Ha ha ha!--But come to think of it, \'tis no wonder Axel\r\nshould be angry."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go, then," said Eleseus again. But she was still indifferent,\r\nnot in the least afraid, caring nothing that he sat there struggling\r\nwith his feelings. Fool of a woman!\r\n\r\nAnd now he began to grow angry; he hinted his displeasure at first\r\ndelicately: to the effect that she was a nice sort indeed, and a\r\ncredit to her sex, huh! But when that produced no effect--oh, he would\r\nhave done better to endure it patiently, and say nothing. But he grew\r\nno better for that; he said: "If I\'d known you were going to be like\r\nthis, I\'d never have come this evening at all."\r\n\r\n"Well, what if you hadn\'t?" said she. "You\'d have lost a chance of\r\nairing that cane of yours that you\'re so fond of."\r\n\r\nOh, Barbro, she had lived in Bergen, she knew how to jeer at a man;\r\nshe had seen real walking-sticks, and could ask now what he wanted to\r\ngo swinging a patched-up umbrella handle like that for. But he let her\r\ngo on.\r\n\r\n"I suppose now you\'ll be wanting that photograph back you gave me,"\r\nhe said. And if that didn\'t move her, surely nothing would, for among\r\nfolks in the wilds, there was nothing counted so mean as to take back\r\na gift.\r\n\r\n"That\'s as it may be," she answered evasively.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you shall have it all right," he answered bravely. "I\'ll send\r\nit back at once, never fear. And now perhaps you\'ll give me back my\r\nletter." Eleseus rose to his feet.\r\n\r\nVery well; she gave him back the letter. But now the tears came into\r\nher eyes as she did so; this servant girl was touched; her friend was\r\nforsaking her--good-bye for ever!\r\n\r\n"You\'ve no need to go," she said. "I don\'t care for what Axel says."\r\n\r\nBut Eleseus had the upper hand now, and must use it; he thanked\r\nher and said good-bye. "When a lady carries on that way," he said,\r\n"there\'s nothing else to be done."\r\n\r\nHe left the house, quietly, and walked up homeward, whistling,\r\nswinging his stick, and playing the man. Huh! A little while after\r\ncame Barbro walking up; she called to him once or twice. Very well;\r\nhe stopped, so he did, but was a wounded lion. She sat down in the\r\nheather looking penitent; she fidgeted with a sprig, and a little\r\nafter he too softened, and asked for a kiss, the last time, just to\r\nsay good-bye, he said. No, she would not. "Be nice and be a dear, like\r\nyou were last time," he begged, and moved round her on all sides,\r\nstepping quickly, if he could see his chance. But she would not be a\r\ndear; she got up. And there she stood. And at that he simply nodded\r\nand went.\r\n\r\nWhen he was out of sight, Axel appeared suddenly from behind\r\nsome bushes. Barbro started, all taken aback, and asked: "What\'s\r\nthat--where have you been? Up that way?"\r\n\r\n"No; I\'ve been down that way," he answered. "But I saw you two going\r\nup here."\r\n\r\n"Ho, did you? And a lot of good it did you, I dare say," she cried,\r\nsuddenly furious. She was certainly not easier to deal with now. "What\r\nare you poking and sniffing about after, I\'d like to know? What\'s it\r\nto do with you?"\r\n\r\nAxel was not in the best of temper himself. "H\'m. So he\'s been here\r\nagain today?"\r\n\r\n"Well, what if he has? What do you want with him?"\r\n\r\n"I want with him? It\'s what you want with him, I\'d like to ask. You\r\nought to be ashamed."\r\n\r\n"Ashamed? Huh! The least said about that, if you ask me," said Barbro.\r\n"I\'m here to sit in the house like a statue, I suppose? What have I\r\ngot to be ashamed of, anyway? If you like to go and get some one else\r\nto look after the place, I\'m ready to go. You hold your tongue, that\'s\r\nall I\'ve got to say, if it\'s not too much to ask. I\'m going back now\r\nto get your supper and make the coffee, and after that I can do as I\r\nplease."\r\n\r\nThey came home with the quarrel at its height.\r\n\r\nNo, they were not always the best of friends, Axel and Barbro; there\r\nwas trouble now and again. She had been with him now for a couple of\r\nyears, and they had had words before; mostly when Barbro talked of\r\nfinding another place. He wanted her to stay there for ever, to settle\r\ndown there and share the house and life with him; he knew how hard\r\nit would be for him if he were left without help again. And she had\r\npromised several times--ay, in her more affectionate moments she would\r\nnot think of going away at all. But the moment they quarrelled about\r\nanything, she invariably threatened to go. If for nothing else, she\r\nmust go to have her teeth seen to in town. Go, go away ... Axel felt\r\nhe must find a means to keep her.\r\n\r\nKeep her? A lot Barbro cared for his trying to keep her if she didn\'t\r\nwant to stay.\r\n\r\n"Ho, so you want to go away again?" said he.\r\n\r\n"Well, and if I do?"\r\n\r\n"_Can_ you, d\'you think?"\r\n\r\n"Well, and why not? If you think I\'m afraid because the winter\'s\r\ncoming on ... But I can get a place in Bergen any day I like."\r\n\r\nThen said Axel steadily enough: "It\'ll be some time before you can do\r\nthat, anyway. As long as you\'re with child."\r\n\r\n"With child? What are you talking about?"\r\n\r\nAxel stared. Was the girl mad? True, he himself should have been more\r\npatient. Now that he had the means of keeping her, he had grown too\r\nconfident, and that was a mistake; there was no need to be sharp with\r\nher and make her wild; he need not have ordered her in so many words\r\nto help him with the potatoes that spring--he might have planted\r\nthem by himself. There would be plenty of time for him to assert his\r\nauthority after they were married; until then he ought to have had\r\nsense enough to give way.\r\n\r\nBut--it _was_ too bad, this business with Eleseus, this clerk, who\r\ncame swaggering about with his walking-stick and all his fine talk.\r\nFor a girl to carry on like that when she was promised to another\r\nman--and in her condition! It was beyond understanding. Up to then,\r\nAxel had had no rival to compete with--now, it was different.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s a new paper for you," he said. "And here\'s a bit of a thing I\r\ngot you. Don\'t know if you\'ll care about it."\r\n\r\nBarbro was cold. They were sitting there together, drinking scalding\r\nhot coffee from the bowl, but for all that she answered icy cold:\r\n\r\n"I suppose that\'s the gold ring you\'ve been promising me this\r\ntwelvemonth and more."\r\n\r\nThis, however, was beyond the mark, for it _was_ the ring after all.\r\nBut a gold ring it was not, and that he had never promised her--\'twas\r\nan invention of her own; silver it was, with gilt hands clasped, real\r\nsilver, with the mark on and all. But ah, that unlucky voyage of hers\r\nto Bergen! Barbro had seen real engagement rings--no use telling her!\r\n\r\n"That ring! Huh! You can keep it yourself."\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong with it, then?"\r\n\r\n"Wrong with it? There\'s nothing wrong with it that I know," she\r\nanswered, and got up to clear the table.\r\n\r\n"Why, you\'ll needs make do with it for now," he said. "Maybe I\'ll\r\nmanage another some day."\r\n\r\nBarbro made no answer.\r\n\r\nA thankless creature was Barbro this evening. A new silver ring--she\r\nmight at least have thanked him nicely for it. It must be that clerk\r\nwith the town ways that had turned her head. Axel could not help\r\nsaying: "I\'d like to know what that fellow Eleseus keeps coming here\r\nfor, anyway. What does he want with you?"\r\n\r\n"With me?"\r\n\r\n"Ay. Is he such a greenhorn and can\'t see how \'tis with you now?\r\nHasn\'t he eyes in his head?"\r\n\r\nBarbro turned on him straight at that: "Oh, so you think you\'ve got\r\na hold on me because of _that_? You\'ll find out you\'re wrong, that\'s\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"Ho!" said Axel.\r\n\r\n"Ay, and I\'ll not stay here, neither."\r\n\r\nBut Axel only smiled a little at this; not broadly and laughing in\r\nher face, no; for he did not mean to cross her. And then he spoke\r\nsoothingly, as to a child: "Be a good girl now, Barbro. \'Tis you and\r\nme, you know."\r\n\r\nAnd of course in the end Barbro gave in and was good, and even went to\r\nsleep with the silver ring on her finger.\r\n\r\nIt would all come right in time, never fear.\r\n\r\nFor the two in the hut, yes. But what about Eleseus? \'Twas worse with\r\nhim; he found it hard to get over the shameful way Barbro had treated\r\nhim. He knew nothing of hysterics, and took it as all pure cruelty on\r\nher part; that girl Barbro from Breidablik thought a deal too much of\r\nherself, even though she _had_ been in Bergen....\r\n\r\nHe sent her back the photograph in a way of his own--took it down\r\nhimself one night and stuck it through the door to her in the hayloft,\r\nwhere she slept. \'Twas not done in any rough unmannerly way, not at\r\nall; he had fidgeted with the door a long time so as to wake her, and\r\nwhen she rose up on her elbow and asked, "What\'s the matter; can\'t you\r\nfind your way in this evening?" he understood the question was meant\r\nfor some one else, and it went through him like a needle; like a\r\nsabre.\r\n\r\nHe walked back home--no walking-stick, no whistling. He did not care\r\nabout playing the man any longer. A stab at the heart is no light\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nAnd was that the last of it?\r\n\r\nOne Sunday he went down just to look; to peep and spy. With a sickly\r\nand unnatural patience he lay in hiding among the bushes, staring over\r\nat the hut. And when at last there came a sign of life and movement it\r\nwas enough to make an end of him altogether: Axel and Barbro came\r\nout together and went across to the cowshed. They were loving and\r\naffectionate now, ay, they had a blessed hour; they walked with their\r\narms round each other, and he was going to help her with the animals.\r\nHo, yes!\r\n\r\nEleseus watched the pair with a look as if he had lost all; as a\r\nruined man. And his thought, maybe, was like this: There she goes arm\r\nin arm with Axel Stroem. How she could ever do it I can\'t think; there\r\nwas a time when she put her arms round me! And there they disappeared\r\ninto the shed.\r\n\r\nWell, let them! Huh! Was he to lie here in the bushes and forget\r\nhimself? A nice thing for him--to lie there flat on his belly and\r\nforget himself. Who was she, after all? But he was the man he was.\r\nHuh! again.\r\n\r\nHe sprang to his feet and stood up. Brushed the twigs and dust from\r\nhis clothes and drew himself up and stood upright again. His rage and\r\ndesperation came out in a curious fashion now: he threw all care to\r\nthe winds, and began singing a ballad of highly frivolous import. And\r\nthere was an earnest expression on his face as he took care to sing\r\nthe worst parts loudest of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nIsak came back from the village with a horse. Ay, it had come to that;\r\nhe had bought the horse from the Lensmand\'s assistant; the animal was\r\nfor sale, as Geissler had said, but it cost two hundred and forty\r\n_Kroner_--that was sixty _Daler_. The price of horseflesh had gone up\r\nbeyond all bounds: when Isak was a boy the best horse could be bought\r\nfor fifty _Daler_.\r\n\r\nBut why had he never raised a horse himself? He had thought of it, had\r\nimagined a nice little foal--that he had been waiting for these two\r\nyears past. That was a business for folk who could spare the time from\r\ntheir land, could leave waste patches lying waste till they got a\r\nhorse to carry home the crop. The Lensmand\'s assistant had said: "I\r\ndon\'t care about paying for a horse\'s keep myself; I\'ve no more hay\r\nthan my womenfolk can get it in by themselves while I\'m away on duty."\r\n\r\nThe new horse was an old idea of Isak\'s, he had been thinking of it\r\nfor years; it was not Geissler who had put him up to it. And he had\r\nalso made preparations such as he could; a new stall, a new rope for\r\ntethering it in the summer; as for carts, he had some already, he must\r\nmake some more for the autumn. Most important of all was the fodder,\r\nand he had not forgotten that, of course; or why should he have\r\nthought it so important to get that last patch broken up last year if\r\nit hadn\'t been to save getting rid of one of the cows, and yet have\r\nenough keep for a new horse? It was, sown for green fodder now; that\r\nwas for the calving cows.\r\n\r\nAy, he had thought it all out. Well might Inger be astonished again,\r\nand clap her hands just as in the old days.\r\n\r\nIsak brought news from the village; Breidablik was to be sold, there\r\nwas a notice outside the church. The bit of crop, such as it was,--hay\r\nand potatoes,--to go with the rest. Perhaps the live stock too; a few\r\nbeasts only, nothing big.\r\n\r\n"Is he going to sell up the home altogether and leave nothing?" cried\r\nInger. "And where\'s he going to live?"\r\n\r\n"In the village."\r\n\r\nIt was true enough. Brede was going back to the tillage. But he had\r\nfirst tried to get Axel Stroem to let him live there with Barbro.\r\nHe didn\'t succeed. Brede would never dream of interfering with the\r\nrelations between his daughter and Axel, so he was careful not to make\r\nhimself a nuisance, though to be sure it was a hard set-back, with all\r\nthe rest. Axel was going to get his new house built that autumn; well,\r\nthen, when he and Barbro moved in there, why couldn\'t Brede and his\r\nfamily have a hut? No! \'Twas so with Brede, he didn\'t look at things\r\nlike a farmer and a settler on new land; he didn\'t understand that\r\nAxel had to move out because he wanted the hut for his growing stock;\r\nthe hut was to be a new cowshed. And even when this was explained to\r\nhim, he failed to see the point of view; surely human beings should\r\ncome before animals, he said. No, a settler\'s way was different;\r\nanimals first; a man could always find himself a shelter for the\r\nwinter. But Barbro put in a word herself now: "Ho, so you put the\r\nanimals first and us after? \'Tis just as well I know it!" So Axel had\r\nmade enemies of a whole family because he hadn\'t room to house them.\r\nBut he would not give way. He was no good-natured fool, was Axel, but\r\non the contrary he had grown more and more careful; he knew well that\r\na crowd like that moving in would give him so many more mouths to\r\nfill. Brede bade his daughter be quiet, and tried to make out that he\r\nhimself would rather move down to the village again; couldn\'t endure\r\nlife in the wilderness, he said--\'twas only for that reason he was\r\nselling the place.\r\n\r\nOh, but to tell the truth it was not so much Brede was selling the\r\nplace; \'twas the Bank and the storekeeper were selling up Breidablik,\r\nthough for the sake of appearances they let it be done in Brede\'s\r\nname. That way, he thought he was saved from disgrace. And Brede was\r\nnot altogether dejected when Isak met him; he consoled himself with\r\nthe thought that he was still Inspector on the telegraph line; that\r\nwas a regular income, anyway, and in time he would be able to work up\r\nto his old position in the place as the Lensmand\'s companion and this\r\nand that. He was something affected at the change, of course; \'twas\r\nnot so easy to say good-bye to a place where one had lived and toiled\r\nand moiled so many years, and come to care for. But Brede, good man,\r\nwas never long cast down. \'Twas his best point, the charm of him. He\r\nhad once in his life taken it into his head to be a tiller of the\r\nsoil, \'twas an inspiration had come to him. True, he had not made a\r\nsuccess of it, but he had taken up other plans in the same airy way\r\nand got on better; and who could say--perhaps his samples of ore might\r\nafter all turn out something wonderful in time! And then look at\r\nBarbro, he had got her fixed up there at Maaneland, and she\'d not be\r\nleaving Axel Stroem now, that he could swear--\'twas plain indeed for\r\nany one to see.\r\n\r\nNo, there was nothing to fear as long as he had his health and could\r\nwork for himself and those that looked to him, said Brede Olsen. And\r\nthe children were just growing up, and big enough now to go out and\r\nmake their own way in the world, said he. Helge was gone to the\r\nherring fisheries already, and Katrine was going to help at the\r\ndoctor\'s. That left only the two youngest--well, well, there was a\r\nthird on the way, true, but, anyhow ...\r\n\r\nIsak had more news from the village: the Lensmand\'s lady had had a\r\nbaby. Inger suddenly interested at this: "Boy or girl?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I didn\'t hear which," said Isak.\r\n\r\nBut the Lensmand\'s lady had had a child after all--after all the way\r\nshe\'d spoken at the women\'s club about the increasing birth-rate among\r\nthe poor; better give women the franchise and let them have some say\r\nin their own affairs, she said. And now she was caught. Yes, the\r\nparson\'s wife had said, "She\'s had some say in lots of things--but\r\nher own affairs are none the better for it, ha ha ha!" And that was a\r\nclever saying that went the round of the village, and there were many\r\nthat understood what was meant--Inger no doubt as well; it was only\r\nIsak who did not understand.\r\n\r\nIsak understood his work, his calling. He was a rich man now, with a\r\nbig farm, but the heavy cash payments that had come to him by a lucky\r\nchance he used but poorly; he put the money aside. The land saved him.\r\nIf he had lived down in the village, maybe the great world would have\r\naffected even him; so much gaiety, so many elegant manners and ways;\r\nhe would have been buying useless trifles, and wearing a red Sunday\r\nshirt on weekdays. Here in the wilds he was sheltered from all\r\nimmoderation; he lived in clear air, washed himself on Sunday\r\nmornings, and took a bath when he went up to the lake. Those thousand\r\n_Daler_--well, \'twas a gift from Heaven, to be kept intact. What else\r\nshould he do? His ordinary outgoings were more than covered by the\r\nproduce of his fields and stock.\r\n\r\nEleseus, of course, knew better; he had advised his father to put the\r\nmoney in the Bank. Well, perhaps that was the best, but Isak had put\r\noff doing it for the present--perhaps it would never be done at all.\r\nNot that Isak was above taking advice from his son; Eleseus was no\r\nfool, as he showed later on. Now, in the haymaking season, he had\r\ntried his hand with the scythe--but he was no master hand at that, no.\r\nHe kept close to Sivert, and had to get him to use the whetstone every\r\ntime. But Eleseus had long arms and could pick up hay in first-rate\r\nfashion. And he and Sivert and Leopoldine, and Jensine the\r\nservant-maid, they were all busy now in the fields with the first lot\r\nof hay that year. Eleseus did not spare himself either, but raked away\r\ntill his hands were blistered and had to be wrapped in rags. He had\r\nlost his appetite for a week or so, but worked none the worse for\r\nit now. Something had come over the boy; it looked perhaps as if a\r\ncertain unhappy love affair or something of the sort, a touch of\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten sorrow and distress, had done him a world of\r\ngood. And, look you, he had by now smoked the last of the tobacco\r\nhe had brought with him from town; ordinarily, that would have been\r\nenough to make a clerk go about banging doors and expressing himself\r\nemphatically upon many points; but no, Eleseus only grew the steadier\r\nfor it firmer and more upright; a man indeed. Even Sivert, the jester,\r\ncould not put him out of countenance. Today the pair of them were\r\nlying out on boulders in the river to drink, and Sivert imprudently\r\noffered to get some extra fine moss and dry it for tobacco--"unless\r\nyou\'d rather smoke it raw?" he said.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll give you tobacco," said Eleseus, and reaching out, ducked Sivert\r\nhead and shoulders in the water. Ho, one for him! Sivert came back\r\nwith his hair still dripping.\r\n\r\n"Looks like Eleseus he\'s turning out for the good," thought Isak to\r\nhimself, watching his son at work. And to Inger he said: "H\'m--wonder\r\nif Eleseus he\'ll be staying home now for good?"\r\n\r\nAnd she just as queerly cautious again: "\'Tis more than I can say. No,\r\nI doubt if he will."\r\n\r\n"Ho! Have you said a word of it to himself?"\r\n\r\n"No--well, yes, I\'ve talked a bit with him, maybe. But that\'s the way\r\nI think."\r\n\r\n"Like to know, now--suppose he\'d a bit of land of his own...."\r\n\r\n"How do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"If he\'d work on a place of his own?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Well, have you said anything?"\r\n\r\n"Said anything? Can\'t you see for yourself? No, I don\'t see anything\r\nin him Eleseus, that way."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t sit there talking ill of him," said Isak impartially. "All I\r\ncan see is, he\'s doing a good day\'s work down there."\r\n\r\n"Ay, maybe," said Inger submissively.\r\n\r\n"And I can\'t see what you\'ve got to find fault with the lad," cried\r\nIsak, evidently displeased. "He does his work better and better every\r\nday, and what can you ask more?"\r\n\r\nInger murmured: "Ay, but he\'s not like he used to be. You try talking\r\nto him about waistcoats."\r\n\r\n"About waistcoats? What d\'you mean?"\r\n\r\n"How he used to wear white waistcoats in summer when he was in town,\r\nso he says."\r\n\r\nIsak pondered this a while; it was beyond him. "Well, can\'t he have a\r\nwhite waistcoat?" he said. Isak was out of his depth here; of course\r\nit was only women\'s nonsense; to his mind, the boy had a perfect right\r\nto a white waistcoat, if it pleased him; anyhow, he couldn\'t see what\r\nthere was to make a fuss about, and was inclined to put the matter\r\naside and go on.\r\n\r\n"Well, what do you think, if he had Brede\'s bit of land to work on?"\r\n\r\n"Who?" said Inger.\r\n\r\n"Him Eleseus."\r\n\r\n"Breidablik? Nay, \'tis more than\'s worth your while."\r\n\r\nThe fact was, she had already been talking over that very plan with\r\nEleseus, she had heard it from Sivert, who could not keep the secret.\r\nAnd indeed, why should Sivert keep the matter secret when his father\r\nhad surely told him of it on purpose to feel his way? It was not the\r\nfirst time he had used Sivert as a go-between. Well, but what had\r\nEleseus answered? Just as before, as in his letters from town,\r\nthat no, he would not throw away all he had learned, and be an\r\ninsignificant nothing again. That was what he had said. Well, and then\r\nhis mother had brought out all her good reasons, but Eleseus had said\r\nno to them all; he had other plans for his life. Young hearts have\r\ntheir unfathomable depths, and after what had happened, likely enough\r\nhe did not care about staying on with Barbro as a neighbour. Who could\r\nsay? He had put it loftily enough in talking to his mother; he could\r\nget a better position in town than the one he had; could go as clerk\r\nto one of the higher officials. He must get on, he must rise in the\r\nworld. In a few years, perhaps, he might be a Lensmand, or perhaps a\r\nlighthouse keeper, or get into the Customs. There were so many roads\r\nopen to a man with learning.\r\n\r\nHowever it might be, his mother came round, was drawn over to his\r\npoint of view. Oh, she was so little sure of herself yet; the world\r\nhad not quite lost its hold on her. Last winter she had gone so far as\r\nto read occasionally a certain excellent devotional work which she had\r\nbrought from Trondhjem, from the Institute; but now, Eleseus might be\r\na Lensmand one day!\r\n\r\n"And why not?" said Eleseus. "What\'s Heyerdahl himself but a former\r\nclerk in the same department?"\r\n\r\nSplendid prospects. His mother herself advised him not to give up his\r\ncareer and throw himself away. What was a man like that to do in the\r\nwilds?\r\n\r\nBut why should Eleseus then trouble to work hard and steadily as he\r\nwas doing now on his father\'s land? Heaven knows, he had some reason,\r\nmaybe. Something of inborn pride in him still, perhaps; he would not\r\nbe outdone by others; and besides, it would do him no harm to be in\r\nhis father\'s good books the day he went away. To tell the truth, he\r\nhad a number of little debts in town, and it would be a good thing to\r\nbe able to settle them at once--improve his credit a lot. And it was\r\nnot a question now of a mere hundred _Kroner_, but something worth\r\nconsidering.\r\n\r\nEleseus was far from stupid, but on the contrary, a sly fellow in his\r\nway. He had seen his father come home, and knew well enough he was\r\nsitting there in the window at that moment, looking out. No harm in\r\nputting his back into it then for a bit, working a little harder for\r\nthe moment--it would hurt no one, and might do himself good.\r\n\r\nEleseus was somehow changed; whatever it might be, something in him\r\nhad been warped, and quietly spoiled; he was not bad, but something\r\nblemished. Had he lacked a guiding hand those last few years? What\r\ncould his mother do to help him now? Only stand by him and agree. She\r\ncould let herself be dazzled by her son\'s bright prospects for the\r\nfuture, and stand between him and his father, to take his part--she\r\ncould do that.\r\n\r\nBut Isak grew impatient at last over her opposition; to his mind, the\r\nidea about Breidablik was by no means a bad one. Only that very day,\r\ncoming up, he had stopped the horse almost without thinking, to look\r\nout with a critical eye over the ill-tended land; ay, it could be made\r\na fine place in proper hands.\r\n\r\n"Why not worth while?" he asked Inger now. "I\'ve that much feeling for\r\nEleseus, anyway, that I\'d help him to it."\r\n\r\n"If you\'ve any feeling for him, then say never a word of Breidablik\r\nagain," she answered.\r\n\r\n"Ho!"\r\n\r\n"Ay, for he\'s greater thoughts in his head than the like of us."\r\n\r\nIsak, too, is hardly sure of himself here, and it weakens him; but he\r\nis by no means pleased at having shown his hand, and spoken straight\r\nout about his plan. He is unwilling to give it up now.\r\n\r\n"He shall do as I say," declares Isak suddenly. And he raises his\r\nvoice threateningly, in case Inger by any chance should be hard of\r\nhearing. "Ay, you may look; I\'ll say no mere. It\'s midway up, with a\r\nschoolhouse by, and everything; what\'s the greater thoughts he\'s got\r\nbeyond that, I\'d like to know? With a son like that I might starve to\r\ndeath--is that any better, d\'you think? And can you tell me why my own\r\nflesh and blood should turn and go contrary to--to my own flesh and\r\nblood?"\r\n\r\nIsak stopped; he realized that the more he talked the worse it would\r\nbe. He was on the point of changing his clothes, getting out of his\r\nbest things he had put on to go down to the village in; but no, he\r\naltered his mind, he would stay as he was--whatever he meant by that.\r\n"You\'d better say a word of it to Eleseus," he says then.\r\n\r\nAnd Inger answers: "Best if you\'d say it yourself. He won\'t do as I\r\nsay."\r\n\r\nVery well, then, Isak is head of the house, so he should think; now\r\nsee if Eleseus dares to murmur! But, whether it were because he feared\r\ndefeat, Isak draws back now, and says: "Ay, \'tis true, I might say a\r\nword of it myself. But by reason of having so many things to do, and\r\nbusy with this and that, I\'ve something else to think of."\r\n\r\n"Well ...?" said Inger in surprise.\r\n\r\nAnd Isak goes off again--not very far, only to the farther fields, but\r\nstill, he goes off. He is full of mysteries, and must hide himself out\r\nof the way. The fact is this: he had brought back a third piece of\r\nnews from the village today, and that was something more than the\r\nrest, something enormous; and he had hidden it at the edge of the\r\nwood. There it stands, wrapped up in sacking and paper; he uncovers\r\nit, and lo, a huge machine. Look! red and blue, wonderful to see, with\r\na heap of teeth and a heap of knives, with joints and arms and screws\r\nand wheels--a mowing-machine. No, Isak would not have gone down today\r\nfor the new horse if it hadn\'t been for that machine.\r\n\r\nHe stands with a marvellously keen expression, going over in his mind\r\nfrom beginning to end the instructions for use that the storekeeper\r\nhad read out; he sets a spring here, and shifts a bolt there, then he\r\noils every hole and every crevice, then he looks over the whole thing\r\nonce more. Isak had never known such an hour in his life. To pick up a\r\npen and write one\'s mark on a paper, a document--ay, \'twas a perilous\r\ngreat thing that, no doubt. Likewise in the matter of a new harrow he\r\nhad once brought up--there were many curiously twisted parts in that\r\nto be considered. Not to speak of the great circular saw that had to\r\nbe set in its course to the nicety of a pencil line, never\r\nswaying east nor west, lest it should fly asunder. But this--this\r\nmowing-machine of his--\'twas a crawling nest of steel springs and\r\nhooks and apparatus, and hundreds of screws--Inger\'s sewing-machine\r\nwas a bookmarker compared with this!\r\n\r\nIsak harnessed himself to the shafts and tried the thing. Here was the\r\nwonderful moment. And that was why he kept out of sight and was his\r\nown horse.\r\n\r\nFor--what if the machine had been wrongly put together and did not do\r\nits work, but went to pieces with a crash! No such calamity happened,\r\nhowever; the machine could cut grass. And so indeed it ought, after\r\nIsak had stood there, deep in study, for hours. The sun had gone down.\r\nAgain he harnesses himself and tries it; ay, the thing cuts grass. And\r\nso indeed it ought!\r\n\r\nWhen the dew began to fall close after the heat of the day, and the\r\nboys came out, each with his scythe to mow in readiness for next day,\r\nIsak came in sight close to the house and said:\r\n\r\n"Put away scythes for tonight. Get out the new horse, you can, and\r\nbring him down to the edge of the wood."\r\n\r\nAnd on that, instead of going indoors to his supper as the others had\r\ndone already, he turned where he stood and went back the way he had\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n"D\'you want the cart, then?" Sivert called after him.\r\n\r\n"No," said his father, and walked on.\r\n\r\nSwelling with mystery, full of pride; with a little lift and throw\r\nfrom the knee at every step, so emphatically did he walk. So a brave\r\nman might walk to death and destruction, carrying no weapon in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThe boys came up with the horse, saw the machine, and stopped dead.\r\nIt was the first mowing-machine in the wilds, the first in the\r\nvillage--red and blue, a thing of splendour to man\'s eyes. And the\r\nfather, head of them all, called out, oh, in a careless tone, as if it\r\nwere nothing uncommon: "Harness up to this machine here."\r\n\r\nAnd they drove it; the father drove. Brrr! said the thing, and felled\r\nthe grass in swathes. The boys walked behind, nothing in their hands,\r\ndoing no work, smiling. The father stopped and looked back. H\'m, not\r\nas clear as it might be. He screws up a nut here and there to bring\r\nthe knives closer to the ground, and tries again. No, not right yet,\r\nall uneven; the frame with the cutters seems to be hopping a little.\r\nFather and sons discuss what it can be. Eleseus has found the\r\ninstructions and is reading them. "Here, it says to sit up on the seat\r\nwhen you drive--then it runs steadier," he says.\r\n\r\n"Ho!" says his father. "Ay, \'tis so, I know," he answers. "I\'ve\r\nstudied it all through." He gets up into the seat and starts off\r\nagain; it goes steadily now. Suddenly the machine stops working--the\r\nknives are not cutting at all. "_Ptro_! What\'s wrong now?" Father down\r\nfrom his seat, no longer swelling with pride, but bending an anxious,\r\nquestioning face down over the machine. Father and sons all stare at\r\nit; something must be wrong. Eleseus stands holding the instructions.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s a bolt or something," says Sivert, picking up a thing from the\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\n"Ho, that\'s all right, then," says his father, as if that was all that\r\nwas needed to set everything in order. "I was just looking for that\r\nbolt." But now they could not find the hole for it to fit in--where\r\nin the name of wonder could the hole be, now?\r\n\r\nAnd it was now that Eleseus could begin to feel himself a person\r\nof importance; he was the man to make out a printed paper of\r\ninstructions. What would they do without him? He pointed unnecessarily\r\nlong to the hole and explained: "According to the illustration, the\r\nbolt should fit in there."\r\n\r\n"Ay, that\'s where she goes," said his father. "\'Twas there I had it\r\nbefore." And, by way of regaining lost prestige, he ordered Sivert\r\nto set about looking for more bolts in the grass. "There ought to be\r\nanother," he said, looking very important, as if he carried the whole\r\nthing in his head. "Can\'t you find another? Well, well, it\'ll be in\r\nits hole then, all right."\r\n\r\nFather starts off again.\r\n\r\n"Wait a minute--this is wrong," cried Eleseus. Ho, Eleseus standing\r\nthere with the drawing in his hand, with the Law in his hand; no\r\ngetting away from him! "That spring there goes outside," he says to\r\nhis father.\r\n\r\n"Ay, what then?"\r\n\r\n"Why, you\'ve got it in under, you\'ve set it wrong. It\'s a steel\r\nspring, and you have to fix it outside, else the bolt jars out again\r\nand stops the knives. You can see in the picture here."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve left my spectacles behind, and can\'t see it quite," says his\r\nfather, something meekly. "You can see better--you set it as it should\r\ngo. I don\'t want to go up to the house for my spectacles now."\r\n\r\nAll in order now, and Isak gets up. Eleseus calls after him: "You must\r\ndrive pretty fast, it cuts better that way--it says so here."\r\n\r\nIsak drives and drives, and everything goes well, and Brrr! says the\r\nmachine. There is a broad track of cut grass in his wake, neatly in\r\nline, ready to take up. Now they can see him from the house, and all\r\nthe womenfolk come out; Inger carries little Rebecca on her arm,\r\nthough little Rebecca has learned to walk by herself long since.\r\nBut there they come--four womenfolk, big and small--hurrying with\r\nstraining eyes down towards the miracle, flocking down to see. Oh, but\r\nnow is Isak\'s hour. Now he is truly proud, a mighty man, sitting high\r\naloft dressed in holiday clothes, in all his finery; in jacket and\r\nhat, though the sweat is pouring off him. He swings round in four big\r\nangles, goes over a good bit of ground, swings round, drives, cuts\r\ngrass, passes along by where the women are standing; they are\r\ndumbfounded, it is all beyond them, and Brrr! says the machine.\r\n\r\nThen Isak stops and gets down. Longing, no doubt, to hear what these\r\nfolk on earth down there will say; what they will find to say about it\r\nall. He hears smothered cries; they fear to disturb him, these beings\r\non earth, in his lordly work, but they turn to one another with awed\r\nquestionings, and he hears what they say. And now, that he may be a\r\nkind and fatherly lord and ruler to them all, to encourage them, he\r\nsays: "There, I\'ll just do this bit, and you can spread it tomorrow."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you time to come in and have a bite of food?" says Inger, all\r\noverwhelmed.\r\n\r\n"Nay, I\'ve other things to do," he answers.\r\n\r\nThen he oils the machine again; gives them to understand that he is\r\noccupied with scientific work. Drives off again, cutting more grass.\r\nAnd, at long last, the womenfolk go back home.\r\n\r\nHappy Isak--happy folk at Sellanraa!\r\n\r\nVery soon the neighbours from below will be coming up. Axel Stroem\r\nis interested in things, he may be up tomorrow. But Brede from\r\nBreidablik, he might be here that very evening. Isak would not be loth\r\nto show them his machine, explain it to them, tell them how it works,\r\nand all about it. He can point out how that no man with a scythe could\r\never cut so fine and clean. But it costs money, of course--oh, a\r\nred-and-blue machine like that is a terribly costly thing!\r\n\r\nHappy Isak!\r\n\r\nBut as he stops for oil the third time, there! his spectacles fall\r\nfrom his pocket. And, worst of all, the two boys saw it. Was there\r\na higher power behind that little happening--a warning against\r\noverweening pride? He had put on those spectacles time and again that\r\nday to study the instructions, without making out a word; Eleseus had\r\nto help him with that. Eyah, _Herregud_, \'twas a good thing, no doubt,\r\nto be book-learned. And, by way of humbling himself, Isak determines\r\nto give up his plan of making Eleseus a tiller of soil in the wilds;\r\nhe will never say a word of it again.\r\n\r\nNot that the boys made any great business about that matter of the\r\nspectacles; far from it. Sivert, the jester, had to say something, of\r\ncourse; it was too much for him. He plucked Eleseus by the sleeve and\r\nsaid: "Here, come along, we\'ll go back home and throw those scythes on\r\nthe fire. Father\'s going to do all the mowing now with his machine!"\r\nAnd that was a jest indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook Two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I\r\n\r\n\r\nSellanraa is no longer a desolate spot in in the waste; human beings\r\nlive here--seven of them, counting great and small. But in the little\r\ntime the haymaking lasted there came a stranger or so, folk wanting\r\nto see the mowing-machine. Brede Olsen was first, of course, but Axel\r\nStroem came, too, and other neighbours from lower down--ay, from\r\nright down in the village. And from across the hills came Oline, the\r\nimperishable Oline.\r\n\r\nThis time, too, she brought news with her from her own village; \'twas\r\nnot Oline\'s way to come empty of gossip. Old Sivert\'s affairs had been\r\ngone into, his accounts reckoned up, and the fortune remaining after\r\nhim come to nothing. Nothing!\r\n\r\nHere Oline pressed her lips together and looked from one to another.\r\nWell, was there not a sigh--would not the roof fall down? Eleseus was\r\nthe first to smile.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s see--you\'re called after your Uncle Sivert, aren\'t you?" he\r\nasked softly.\r\n\r\nAnd little Sivert answered as softly again:\r\n\r\n"That\'s so. But I made you a present of all that might come to me\r\nafter him."\r\n\r\n"And how much was it?"\r\n\r\n"Between five and ten thousand."\r\n\r\n"_Daler_?" cried Eleseus suddenly, mimicking his brother.\r\n\r\nOline, no doubt, thought this ill-timed jesting. Oh, she had herself\r\nbeen cheated of her due; for all that she had managed to squeeze out\r\nsomething like real tears over old Sivert\'s grave. Eleseus should know\r\nbest what he himself had written--so-and-so much to Oline, to be\r\na comfort and support in her declining years. And where was that\r\nsupport? Oh, a broken reed!\r\n\r\nPoor Oline; they might have left her something--single golden gleam\r\nin her life! Oline was not over-blessed with this world\'s goods.\r\nPractised in evil--ay, well used to edging her way by tricks and\r\nlittle meannesses from day to day; strong only as a scandalmonger, as\r\none whose tongue was to be feared; ay, so. But nothing could have made\r\nher worse than before; least of all a pittance left her by the dead.\r\nShe had toiled all her life, had borne children, and taught them her\r\nown few arts; begged for them, maybe stolen for them, but always\r\nmanaging for them somehow--a mother in her poor way. Her powers were\r\nnot less than those of other politicians; she acted for herself and\r\nthose belonging to her, set her speech according to the moment, and\r\ngained her end, earning a cheese or a handful of wool each time; she\r\nalso could live and die in commonplace insincerity and readiness of\r\nwit. Oline--maybe old Sivert had for a moment thought of her as young,\r\npretty, and rosy-cheeked, but now she is old, deformed, a picture of\r\ndecay; she ought to have been dead. Where is she to be buried? She\r\nhas no family vault of her own; nay, she will be lowered down in a\r\ngraveyard to lie among the bones of strangers and unknown; ay, to that\r\nshe comes at last--Oline, born and died. She had been young once. A\r\npittance left to her now, at the eleventh hour? Ay, a single golden\r\ngleam, and this slave-woman\'s hands would have been folded for a\r\nmoment. Justice would have overtaken her with its late reward; for\r\nthat she had begged for her children, maybe stolen for them, but\r\nalways managed for them some way. A moment--and the darkness would\r\nreign in her as before; her eyes glower, her fingers feel out\r\ngraspingly--how much? she would say. What, no more? she would say.\r\nShe would be right again. A mother many times, realizing life--it was\r\nworthy of a great reward.\r\n\r\nBut all went otherwise. Old Sivert\'s accounts had appeared more or\r\nless in order after Eleseus had been through them; but the farm and\r\nthe cow, the fishery and nets were barely enough to cover the deficit.\r\nAnd it was due in some measure to Oline that things had turned out no\r\nworse; so earnest was she in trying to secure a small remainder for\r\nherself that she dragged to light forgotten items that she, as gossip\r\nand newsmonger for years, remembered still, or matters outstanding\r\nwhich others would have passed over on purpose, to avoid causing\r\nunpleasantness to respectable fellow-citizens. Oh, that Oline! And she\r\ndid not even say a word against old Sivert now; he had made his will\r\nin kindness of heart, and there would have been a plenty after him,\r\nbut that the two men sent by the Department to arrange things had\r\ncheated her. But one day all would come to the ears of the Almighty,\r\nsaid Oline threateningly.\r\n\r\nStrange, she found nothing ridiculous in the fact that she was\r\nmentioned in the will; after all, it was an honour of a sort; none of\r\nher likes were named there with her!\r\n\r\nThe Sellanraa folk took the blow with patience; they were not\r\naltogether unprepared. True, Inger could not understand it--Uncle\r\nSivert that had always been so rich....\r\n\r\n"He might have stood forth an upright man and a wealthy before the\r\nLamb and before the Throne," said Oline, "if they hadn\'t robbed him."\r\n\r\nIsak was standing ready to go out to his fields, and Oline said: "Pity\r\nyou\'ve got to go now, Isak; then I shan\'t see the new machine, after\r\nall. You\'ve got a new machine, they say?"\r\n\r\n"Ay."\r\n\r\n"Ay, there\'s talk of it about, and how it cuts quicker than a hundred\r\nscythes. And what haven\'t you got, Isak, with all your means and\r\nriches! Priest, our way, he\'s got a new plough with two handles; but\r\nwhat\'s he, compared with you, and I\'d tell him so to his face."\r\n\r\n"Sivert here\'ll show you the machine; he\'s better at working her than\r\nhis father," said Isak, and went out.\r\n\r\nIsak went out. There is an auction to be held at Breidablik that noon,\r\nand he is going; there\'s but just time to get there now. Not that Isak\r\nany longer thinks of buying the place, but the auction--it is the\r\nfirst auction held there in the wilds, and it would be strange not to\r\ngo.\r\n\r\nHe gets down as far as Maaneland and sees Barbro, and would pass by\r\nwith only a greeting, but Barbro calls to him and asks if he is going\r\ndown. "Ay," said Isak, making to go on again. It is her home that is\r\nbeing sold, and that is why he answers shortly.\r\n\r\n"You going to the sale?" she asks.\r\n\r\n"To the sale? Well, I was only going down a bit. What you\'ve done with\r\nAxel?"\r\n\r\n"Axel? Nay, I don\'t know. He\'s gone down to sale. Doubt he\'ll be\r\nseeing his chance to pick up something for nothing, like the rest."\r\n\r\nHeavy to look at was Barbro now--ay, and sharp and bitter-tongued!\r\n\r\nThe auction has begun; Isak hears the Lensmand calling out, and sees a\r\ncrowd of people. Coming nearer, he does not know them all; there are\r\nsome from other villages, but Brede is fussing about, in his best\r\nfinery, and chattering in his old way. "_Goddag_, Isak. So you\'re\r\ndoing me the honour to come and see my auction sale. Thanks, thanks.\r\nAy, we\'ve been neighbours and friends these many years now, and never\r\nan ill word between us." Brede grows pathetic. "Ay, \'tis strange to\r\nthink of leaving a place where you\'ve lived and toiled and grown fond\r\nof. But what\'s a man to do when it\'s fated so to be?"\r\n\r\n"Maybe \'twill be better for you after," says Isak comfortingly.\r\n\r\n"Why," says Brede, grasping at it himself, "to tell the truth, I think\r\nit will. I\'m not regretting it, not a bit. I won\'t say I\'ve made a\r\nfortune on the place here, but that\'s to come, maybe; and the young\r\nones getting older and leaving the nest--ay, \'tis true the wife\'s got\r\nanother on the way; but for all that...." And suddenly Brede tells his\r\nnews straight out: "I\'ve given up the telegraph business."\r\n\r\n"What?" asks Isak.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve given up that telegraph."\r\n\r\n"Given up the telegraph?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, from new year to be. What was the good of it, anyway? And\r\nsupposing I was out on business, or driving for the Lensmand or the\r\ndoctor, then to have to look after the telegraph first of all--no,\r\nthere\'s no sense nor meaning in it that way. Well enough for them\r\nthat\'s time to spare. But running over hill and dale after a telegraph\r\nwire for next to nothing wages, \'tis no job that for Brede. And then,\r\nbesides, I\'ve had words with the people from the telegraph office\r\nabout it--they\'ve been making a fuss again."\r\n\r\nThe Lensmand keeps repeating the bids for the farm; they have got up\r\nto the few hundred _Kroner_ the place is judged to be worth, and the\r\nbidding goes slowly, now, with but five or ten _Kroner_ more each\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n"Why, surely--\'tis Axel there\'s bidding," cries Brede suddenly, and\r\nhurries eagerly across. "What, you going to take over my place too?\r\nHaven\'t you enough to look after?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m bidding for another man," says Axel evasively.\r\n\r\n"Well, well, \'tis no harm to me, \'twasn\'t that I meant."\r\n\r\nThe Lensmand raises his hammer, a new bid is made, a whole hundred\r\n_Kroner_ at once; no one bids higher, the Lensmand repeats the figure\r\nagain and again, waits for a moment with his hammer raised, and then\r\nstrikes.\r\n\r\nWhose bid?\r\n\r\nAxel Stroem--on behalf of another.\r\n\r\nThe Lensmand notes it down: Axel Stroem as agent.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s that you buying for?" asks Brede. "Not that it\'s any business\r\nof mine, of course, but...."\r\n\r\nBut now some men at the Lensmand\'s table are putting their heads\r\ntogether; there is a representative from the Bank, the storekeeper has\r\nsent his assistant; there is something the matter; the creditors\r\nare not satisfied. Brede is called up, and Brede, careless and\r\nlight-hearted, only nods and is agreed--"but who\'d ever have thought\r\nit didn\'t come up to more?" says he. And suddenly he raises his voice\r\nand declares to all present:\r\n\r\n"Seeing as we\'ve an auction holding anyhow, and I\'ve troubled the\r\nLensmand all this way, I\'m willing to sell what I\'ve got here on the\r\nplace: the cart, live stock, a pitchfork, a grindstone. I\'ve no use\r\nfor the things now; we\'ll sell the lot!"\r\n\r\nSmall bidding now. Brede\'s wife, careless and light-hearted as\r\nhimself, for all the fulness of her in front, has begun selling coffee\r\nat a table. She finds it amusing to play at shop, and smiles; and when\r\nBrede himself comes up for some coffee, she tells him jestingly that\r\nhe must pay for it like the rest. And Brede actually takes out his\r\nlean purse and pays. "There\'s a wife for you," he says to the others.\r\n"Thrifty, what?"\r\n\r\nThe cart is not worth much--it has stood too long uncovered in the\r\nopen; but Axel bids a full five _Kroner_ more at last, and gets the\r\ncart as well. After that Axel buys no more, but all are astonished to\r\nsee that cautious man buying so much as he has.\r\n\r\nThen came the animals. They had been kept in their shed today, so as\r\nto be there in readiness. What did Brede want with live stock when he\r\nhad no farm to keep them on? He had no cows; he had started farming\r\nwith two goats, and had now four. Besides these, there were six sheep.\r\nNo horse.\r\n\r\nIsak bought a certain sheep with flat ears. When Brede\'s children led\r\nit out from the shed, he started bidding at once, and people looked at\r\nhim. Isak from Sellanraa was a rich man, in a good position, with no\r\nneed of more sheep than he had. Brede\'s wife stops selling coffee for\r\na moment, and says: "Ay, you may buy her, Isak; she\'s old, \'tis true,\r\nbut she\'s two and three lambs every blessed year, and that\'s the\r\ntruth."\r\n\r\n"I know it," said Isak, looking straight at her. "I\'ve seen that sheep\r\nbefore."\r\n\r\nHe walks up with Axel Stroem on the way back, leading his sheep on a\r\nstring. Axel is taciturn, seemingly anxious about something, whatever\r\nit might be. There\'s nothing he need be troubled about that one can\r\nsee, thinks Isak; his crops are looking well, most of his fodder is\r\nhoused already, and he has begun timbering his house. All as it should\r\nbe with Axel Stroem; a thought slowly, but sure in the end. And now he\r\nhad got a horse.\r\n\r\n"So you\'ve bought Brede\'s place?" said Isak. "Going to work it\r\nyourself?"\r\n\r\n"No, not for myself. I bought it for another man."\r\n\r\n"Ho!"\r\n\r\n"What d\'you think; was it too much I gave for it?"\r\n\r\n"Why, no. Tis good land for a man that\'ll work it as it should."\r\n\r\n"I bought it for a brother of mine up in Helgeland."\r\n\r\n"Ho!"\r\n\r\n"Then I thought perhaps I\'d half a mind to change with him, too."\r\n\r\n"Change with him--would you?"\r\n\r\n"And perhaps how Barbro she\'d like it better that way."\r\n\r\n"Ay, maybe," said Isak.\r\n\r\nThey walk on for a good way in silence. Then says Axel:\r\n\r\n"They\'ve been after me to take over that telegraph business."\r\n\r\n"The telegraph? H\'m. Ay, I heard that Brede he\'s given it up."\r\n\r\n"H\'m," says Axel, smiling. "\'Tis not so much that way of it, but Brede\r\nthat\'s been turned off."\r\n\r\n"Ay, so," says Isak, and trying to find some excuse for Brede. "It\r\ntakes a deal of time to look after, no doubt."\r\n\r\n"They gave him notice to the new year, if he didn\'t do better."\r\n\r\n"H\'m."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think it\'d be worth my while to take it?"\r\n\r\nIsak thought for a long while, and answered: "Ay, there\'s the money,\r\ntrue, but still...."\r\n\r\n"They\'ve offered me more."\r\n\r\n"How much?"\r\n\r\n"Double."\r\n\r\n"Double? Why, then, I\'d say you should think it over."\r\n\r\n"But they\'ve made the line a bit longer now. No, I don\'t know what\'s\r\nbest to do--there\'s not so much timber to sell here as you\'ve got on\r\nyours, and I\'ve need to buy more things for the work that I\'ve got\r\nnow. And buying things needs money in \'cash, and I\'ve not so much out\r\nof the land and stock that there\'s much over to sell. Seems to me I\'ll\r\nhave to try a year at the telegraph to begin with...."\r\n\r\nIt did not occur to either of them that Brede might "do better" and\r\nkeep the post himself.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached Maaneland, Oline was there already, on her way down.\r\nAy, a strange creature, Oline, crawling about fat and round as a\r\nmaggot, and over seventy years and all, but still getting about. She\r\nsits drinking coffee in the hut, but seeing the men come up, all must\r\ngive way to that, and she comes out.\r\n\r\n"_Goddag_, Axel, and welcome back from the sale. You\'ll not mind me\r\nlooking in to see how you and Barbro\'s getting on? And you\'re getting\r\non finely, to see, and building a new house and getting richer and\r\nricher! And you been buying sheep, Isak?"\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Isak. "You know her, maybe?"\r\n\r\n"If I know her? Nay...."\r\n\r\n"With these flat ears, you can see."\r\n\r\n"Flat ears? How d\'you mean now? And what then? What I was going to\r\nsay: Who bought Brede\'s place, after all? I was just saying to Barbro\r\nhere, who\'d be your neighbours that way now? said I. And Barbro,\r\npoor thing, she sits crying, as natural enough, to be sure; but the\r\nAlmighty that\'s decreed her a new home here at Maaneland ... Flat\r\nears? I\'ve seen a deal of sheep in my day with flat ears and all. And\r\nI\'ll tell you, Isak, that machine of yours, \'twas almost more than my\r\nold eyes could see nor understand. And what she\'ll have cost you I\r\nwon\'t even ask for I never could count so far. Axel, if you\'ve seen\r\nit, you know what I mean; \'twas all as it might be Elijah and his\r\nchariot of fire, and Heaven forgive me that I say it...."\r\n\r\nWhen the hay was all in, Eleseus began making preparations for his\r\nreturn to town. He had written to the engineer to say he was coming,\r\nbut received the extraordinary reply that times were bad, and they\r\nwould have to economize; the office would have to dispense with\r\nEleseus\' services, and the chief would do the work himself.\r\n\r\nThe deuce and all! But after all, what did a district surveyor want\r\nwith an office staff? When he had taken Eleseus on as a youngster, he\r\nhad done so, no doubt, only to show himself as a great man to these\r\nfolks in the wilds; and if he had given him clothes and board till\r\nhis confirmation, he had got some return for it in the way of writing\r\nwork, that was true. Now the boy was grown up, and that made all the\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\n"But," said the engineer, "if you do come back I will do all I can to\r\nget you a place somewhere else, though it may be a difficult matter,\r\nas there are more young men than are wanted looking out for the same\r\nthing. With kind regards...."\r\n\r\nEleseus would go back to town, of course, there could be no question\r\nabout that. Was he to throw himself away? He wanted to get on in the\r\nworld. And he said nothing to those at home as to the altered state of\r\naffairs; it would be no use, and, to tell the truth, he felt a little\r\nout of humour with the whole thing.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, he said nothing. The life at Sellanraa was having its effect\r\non him again; it was an inglorious, commonplace life, but quiet and\r\ndulling to the sense, a dreamy life; there was nothing for him to show\r\noff about, a looking-glass was a thing he had no use for. His town\r\nlife had wrought a schism in himself, and made him finer than the\r\nothers, made him weaker; he began indeed to feel that he must be\r\nhomeless anywhere. He had come to like the smell of tansy again--let\r\nthat pass. But there was no sense at all in a peasant lad\'s standing\r\nlistening in the morning to the girls milking the cows and thinking\r\nthus: they\'re milking, listen now; \'tis almost by way of something\r\nwonderful to hear, a kind of song in nothing but little streams,\r\ndifferent from the brass bands in the town and the Salvation Army and\r\nthe steamer sirens. Music streaming into a pail....\r\n\r\nIt was not the way at Sellanraa to show one\'s feelings overmuch, and\r\nEleseus dreaded the moment when he would have to say good-bye. He was\r\nwell equipped now; again his mother had given him a stock of woven\r\nstuff for underclothes, and his father had commissioned some one to\r\nhand him money as he went out of the door. Money--could Isak really\r\nspare such a thing as money? But it was so, and no otherwise. Inger\r\nhinted that it would doubtless be the last time; for was not Eleseus\r\ngoing to get on and rise in the world by himself?\r\n\r\n"H\'m," said Isak.\r\n\r\nThere was an atmosphere of solemnity, of stillness in the home; they\r\nhad each had a boiled egg at the last meal, and Sivert stood outside\r\nall ready to go down with his brother and carry his things. It was for\r\nEleseus to begin.\r\n\r\nHe began with Leopoldine. Well and good, she said good-bye in return,\r\nand managed it very well. Likewise Jensine the servant-maid, she sat\r\ncarding wool and answered good-bye--but both girls stared at him,\r\nconfound them! and all because he might perhaps be the least bit red\r\nabout the eyes. He shook hands with his mother, and she cried of\r\ncourse quite openly, never caring to remember how he hated crying."\r\nGoo--ood-bye and bl--bless you!" she sobbed out. It was worst with his\r\nfather; worst of all with him. Oh, in every way; he was so toil-worn\r\nand so utterly faithful; he had carried the children in his arms, had\r\ntold them of the seagulls and other birds and beasts, and the wonders\r\nof the field; it was not so long ago, a few years.... Father stands by\r\nthe glass window, then suddenly he turns round, grasps his son\'s hand,\r\nand says quickly and peevishly: "Well, good-bye. There\'s the new horse\r\ngetting loose," and he swings out of the door and hurries away. Oh,\r\nbut he had himself taken care to let the new horse loose a while ago,\r\nand Sivert, the rascal, knew it too, as he stood outside watching his\r\nfather, and smiling to himself. And, anyway, the horse was only in the\r\nrowens.\r\n\r\nEleseus had got it over at last.\r\n\r\nAnd then his mother must needs come out on the door-slab and hiccup\r\nagain and say, "God bless you!" and give him something. "Take\r\nthis--and you\'re not to thank him, he says you\'re not to. And don\'t\r\nforget to write; write often."\r\n\r\nTwo hundred _Kroner_.\r\n\r\nEleseus looked down the field: his father was furiously at work\r\ndriving a tethering-peg into the ground; he seemed to find it a\r\ndifficult matter, for all that the ground was soft enough.\r\n\r\nThe brothers set off down the road; they came to Maaneland, and there\r\nstood Barbro in the doorway and called to them to come up.\r\n\r\n"You going away again, Eleseus? Nay, then, you must come in and take a\r\ncup of coffee at least."\r\n\r\nThey go into the hut, and Eleseus is no longer a prey to the pangs\r\nof love, nor wishful to jump out of windows and take poison; nay, he\r\nspreads his light spring overcoat across his knees, taking care to lay\r\nit so the silver plate is to be seen; then he wipes his hair with\r\nhis handkerchief, and observes delicately: "Beautiful day, isn\'t\r\nit--simply classic!"\r\n\r\nBarbro too is self-possessed enough; she plays with a silver ring on\r\none hand and a gold ring on the other--ay, true enough, if she hasn\'t\r\ngot a gold ring too--and she wears an apron reaching from neck to\r\nfeet, as if to say she is not spoiled as to her figure, whoever else\r\nmay be that way. And when the coffee is ready and her guests are\r\ndrinking, she sews a little to begin with on a white cloth, and then\r\ndoes a little crochet-work with a collar of some sort, and so with all\r\nmanner of maidenly tasks. Barbro is not put out by their visit, and\r\nall the better; they can talk naturally, and Eleseus can be all on the\r\nsurface again, young and witty as he pleases.\r\n\r\n"What have you done with Axel?" asks Sivert.\r\n\r\n"Oh, he\'s about the place somewhere," she answers, pulling herself up.\r\n"And so we\'ll not be seeing you this way any more, I doubt?" she asks\r\nEleseus.\r\n\r\n"It\'s hardly probable," says he.\r\n\r\n"Ay, \'tis no place for one as is used to the town. I only wish I could\r\ngo along with you."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean that, I know."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t mean it? Oh, I\'ve known what it is to live in town, and what\r\nit\'s like here; and I\'ve been in a bigger town than you, for that\r\nmatter--and shouldn\'t I miss it?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean that way," says Eleseus hastily. "After you being in\r\nBergen itself and all." Strange, how impatient she was, after all!\r\n\r\n"I only know that if it wasn\'t for having the papers to read, I\'d not\r\nstay here another day," says she.\r\n\r\n"But what about Axel, then, and all the rest?--\'twas that I was\r\nthinking."\r\n\r\n"As for Axel, \'tis no business of mine. And what about yourself--I\r\ndoubt there\'ll be some one waiting for you in town?"\r\n\r\nAnd at that, Eleseus couldn\'t help showing off a little and closing\r\nhis eyes and turning over the morsel on his tongue: perhaps true\r\nenough there was some one waiting for him in town. Oh, but he could\r\nhave managed this ever so differently, snapped at the chance, if it\r\nhadn\'t been for Sivert sitting there! As it was, he could only say:\r\n"Don\'t talk such nonsense!"\r\n\r\n"Ho," said she--and indeed she was shamefully ill-humoured\r\ntoday--"nonsense, indeed! Well, what can you expect of folk at\r\nMaaneland? we\'re not so great and fine as you--no."\r\n\r\nOh, she could go to the devil, what did Eleseus care; her face was\r\nvisibly dirty, and her condition plain enough now even to his innocent\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you play a bit on the guitar?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"No," answered Barbro shortly. "What I was going to say: Sivert,\r\ncouldn\'t you come and help Axel a bit with the new house a day or\r\nso? If you could begin tomorrow, say, when you come back from the\r\nvillage?"\r\n\r\nSivert thought for a moment. "Ay, maybe. But I\'ve no clothes."\r\n\r\n"I could run up and fetch your working clothes this evening, so\r\nthey\'ll be here when you get back."\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Sivert, "if you could."\r\n\r\nAnd Barbro unnecessarily eager now: "Oh, if only you would come!\r\nHere\'s summer nearly gone already, and the house that should be up and\r\nroofed before the autumn rains. Axel, he\'s been going to ask you a\r\nmany times before, but he couldn\'t, somehow. Oh, you\'d be helping us\r\nno end!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll help as well as I can," said Sivert.\r\n\r\nAnd that was settled.\r\n\r\nBut now it was Eleseus\' turn to be offended. He can see well enough\r\nthat it\'s clever of Barbro and all that, to look out and manage to her\r\nown advantage and Axel\'s too, and get help for the building and save\r\nthe house, but the whole thing is a little too plain; after all, she\r\nis not mistress of the place as yet, and it\'s not so long since he\r\nhimself had kissed her--the creature! Was there never an atom of shame\r\nin her at all?\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Eleseus, then suddenly: "I\'ll come back again in time and\r\nbe a godfather when you\'re ready."\r\n\r\nShe sent him a glance, and answered in great offence: "Godfather,\r\nindeed! And who\'s talking nonsense now, I\'d like to know? \'Twill be\r\ntime enough for you when I send word I\'m looking out for godfathers."\r\nAnd what could Eleseus do then but laugh foolishly and wish himself\r\nout of the place!\r\n\r\n"Here\'s thanks!" says Sivert, and gets up from his seat to go.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s thanks!" says Eleseus also; but he did not rise nor bow as a\r\nman should do in saying thanks for a cup of coffee; not he, indeed--he\r\nwould see her at the devil for a bitter-tongued lump of ugliness.\r\n\r\n"Let me look," said Barbro. "Oh yes; the young men I stayed with in\r\ntown, they had silver plates on their overcoats too, much bigger than\r\nthis," said she. "Well, then, you\'ll come in on your way back, Sivert,\r\nand stay the night? I\'ll get your clothes all right."\r\n\r\nAnd that was good-bye to Barbro.\r\n\r\nThe brothers went on again. Eleseus was not distressed in any way in\r\nthe matter of Barbro; she could go to the devil--and, besides, he had\r\ntwo big bank-notes in his pocket! The brothers took care not to touch\r\non any mournful things, such as the strange way father had said\r\ngood-bye, or how mother had cried. They went a long way round to avoid\r\nbeing stopped at Breidablik, and made a jest of that little ruse.\r\nBut when they came down in sight of the village, and it was time for\r\nSivert to turn homeward again, they both behaved in somewhat unmanly\r\nfashion. Sivert, for instance, was weak enough to say: "I doubt it\'ll\r\nbe a bit lonely, maybe, when you\'re gone."\r\n\r\nAnd at that Eleseus must fall to whistling, and looking to his shoes,\r\nand finding a splinter in his finger, and searching after something in\r\nhis pockets; some papers, he said, couldn\'t make out ... Oh, \'twould\r\nhave gone ill with them if Sivert had not saved things at the last.\r\n"Touch!" he cried suddenly, and touched his brother on the shoulder\r\nand sprang away. It was better after that; they shouted a word of\r\nfarewell or so from a distance, and went each on his own way.\r\n\r\nFate or chance--whatever it might be. Eleseus went back, after all,\r\nto the town, to a post that was no longer open for him, but that same\r\noccasion led to Axel Stroem\'s getting a man to work for him.\r\n\r\nThey began work on the house the 21st of August, and ten days later\r\nthe place was roofed in. Oh, \'twas no great house to see, and nothing\r\nmuch in the way of height; the best that could be said of it was that\r\nit was a wooden house and no turf hut. But, at least, it meant that\r\nthe animals would have a splendid shelter for the winter in what had\r\nbeen a house for human beings up to then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of September Barbro was not to be found. \'Twas not that she\r\nwas altogether lost, but she was not up at the house.\r\n\r\nAxel was doing carpenter\'s work the best he could; he was trying hard\r\nto get a glass window and a door set in the new house, and it was\r\ntaking all his time to do it. But being long past noon, and no word\r\nsaid about coming in to dinner, he went in himself into the hut. No\r\none there. He got himself some food, and looked about while he was\r\neating. All Barbro\'s clothes were hanging there; she must be out\r\nsomewhere, that was all. He went back to his work on the new building,\r\nand kept at it for a while, then he looked in at the hut again--no,\r\nnobody there. She must be lying down somewhere. He sets out to find\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Barbro!" he calls. No. He looks all round the houses, goes across\r\nto some bushes on the edge of his land, searches about a long while,\r\nmaybe an hour, calls out--no. He comes on her a long way off, lying on\r\nthe ground, hidden by some bushes; the stream flows by at her feet,\r\nshe is barefoot and bareheaded, and wet all up the back as well.\r\n\r\n"You lying here?" says he. "Why didn\'t you answer?"\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t," she answers, and her voice so hoarse he can scarcely\r\nhear.\r\n\r\n"What--you been in the water?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Slipped down--oh!"\r\n\r\n"Is it hurting you now?"\r\n\r\n"Ay--it\'s over now."\r\n\r\n"Is it over?" says he.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Help me to get home."\r\n\r\n"Where\'s ...?"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t it--the child?"\r\n\r\n"No. Twas dead."\r\n\r\n"Was it dead?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nAxel is slow of mind, and slow to act. He stands there still. "Where\r\nis it, then?" he asks.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve no call to know," says she. "Help me back home. Twas dead. I\r\ncan walk if you hold my arm a bit."\r\n\r\nAxel carries her back home and sets her in a chair, the water dripping\r\noff her. "Was it dead?" he asks.\r\n\r\n"I told you \'twas so," she answers.\r\n\r\n"What have you done with it, then?"\r\n\r\n"D\'you want to smell it? D\'you get anything to eat while I was away?"\r\n\r\n"But what did you want down by the water?"\r\n\r\n"By the water? I was looking for juniper twigs."\r\n\r\n"Juniper twigs? What for?"\r\n\r\n"For cleaning the buckets."\r\n\r\n"There\'s none that way," says he.\r\n\r\n"You get on with your work," says she hoarsely, and all impatient.\r\n"What was I doing by the water? I wanted twigs for a broom. Have you\r\nhad anything to eat, d\'you hear?"\r\n\r\n"Eat?" says he. "How d\'you feel now?"\r\n\r\n"Tis well enough."\r\n\r\n"I doubt I\'d better fetch the doctor up."\r\n\r\n"You\'d better try!" says she, getting up and looking about for dry\r\nclothes to put on. "As if you\'d no better to do with your money!"\r\n\r\nAxel goes back to his work, and \'tis but little he gets done, but\r\nmakes a bit of noise with planing and hammering, so she can hear. At\r\nlast he gets the window wedged in, and stops the frame all round with\r\nmoss.\r\n\r\nThat evening Barbro seems not to care for her food, but goes about,\r\nall the same, busy with this and that--goes to the cowshed at\r\nmilking-time, only stepping a thought more carefully over the\r\ndoor-sill. She went to bed in the hayshed as usual. Axel went in twice\r\nto look at her, and she was sleeping soundly. She had a good night.\r\n\r\nNext morning she was almost as usual, only so hoarse she could hardly\r\nspeak at all, and with a long stocking wound round her throat. They\r\ncould not talk together. Days passed, and the matter was no longer\r\nnew; other things cropped up, and it slipped aside. The new house\r\nought by rights to have been left a while for the timber to work\r\ntogether and make it tight and sound, but there was no time for that\r\nnow; they had to get it into use at once, and the new cowshed ready.\r\nWhen it was done, and they had moved in, they took up the potatoes,\r\nand after that there was the corn to get in. Life was the same as\r\never.\r\n\r\nBut there were signs enough, great or small, that things were\r\ndifferent now at Maaneland. Barbro felt herself no more at home there\r\nnow than any other serving-maid; no more bound to the place. Axel\r\ncould see that his hold on her had loosened with the death of the\r\nchild. He had thought to himself so confidently: wait till the child\r\ncomes! But the child had come and gone. And at last Barbro even took\r\noff the rings from her fingers, and wore neither.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that mean?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"What\'s it mean?" she said, tossing her head.\r\n\r\nBut it could hardly mean anything else than faithlessness and\r\ndesertion on her part.\r\n\r\nAnd he had found the little body by the stream. Not that he had made\r\nany search for it, to speak of; he knew pretty closely where it must\r\nbe, but he had left the matter idly as it was. Then chance willed it\r\nso that he should not forget it altogether; birds began to hover above\r\nthe spot, shrieking grouse and crows, and then, later on, a pair of\r\neagles at a giddy height above. To begin with, only a single bird had\r\nseen something buried there, and, being unable to keep a secret like a\r\nhuman being, had shouted it abroad. Then Axel roused himself from his\r\napathy, and waited for an opportunity to steal out to the spot. He\r\nfound the thing under a heap of moss and twigs, kept down by flat\r\nstones, and wrapped in a cloth, in a piece of rag. With a feeling of\r\ncuriosity and horror he drew the cloth a little aside--eyes closed,\r\ndark hair, a boy, and the legs crossed--that was all he saw. The\r\ncloth had been wet, but was drying now; the whole thing looked like a\r\nhalf-wrung bundle of washing.\r\n\r\nHe could not leave it there in the light of day, and in his heart,\r\nperhaps, he feared some ill to himself or to the place. He ran home\r\nfor a spade and dug the grave deeper; but, being so near the stream,\r\nthe water came in, and he had to shift it farther up the bank. As he\r\nworked, his fear lest Barbro should come and find him disappeared; he\r\ngrew defiant and thoroughly bitter. Let her come, and he would make\r\nher wrap up the body neatly and decently after her, stillborn or no!\r\nHe saw well enough all he had lost by the death of the child; how he\r\nwas faced now with the prospect of being left without help again on\r\nthe place--and that, moreover, with three times the stock to care for\r\nhe had had at first. Let her come--he did not care! But Barbro--it\r\nmight be she had some inkling of what he was at; anyway, she did not\r\ncome, and Axel had to wrap up the body himself as best he could and\r\nmove it to the new grave. He laid down the turf again on top, just as\r\nbefore, hiding it all. When he had done, there was nothing to be seen\r\nbut a little green mound among the bushes.\r\n\r\nHe found Barbro outside the house as he came home.\r\n\r\n"Where you been?" she asked.\r\n\r\nThe bitterness must have left him, for he only said: "Nowhere.\r\nWhere\'ve you been?"\r\n\r\nOh, but the look on his face must have warned her; she said no more,\r\nbut went into the house.\r\n\r\nHe followed her.\r\n\r\n"Look here," he said, and asked her straight out, "What d\'you mean by\r\ntaking off those rings?"\r\n\r\nBarbro, maybe, found it best to give way a little; she laughed, and\r\nanswered: "Well, you are serious today--I can\'t help laughing! But if\r\nyou want me to put on the rings and wear them out weekdays, why, I\r\nwill!" And she got out the rings and put them on.\r\n\r\nBut seeing him look all foolish and content at that, she grew bolder.\r\n"Is there anything else I\'ve done, I\'d like to know?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not complaining," answered he. "And you\'ve only to be as you were\r\nbefore, all the time before, when you first came. That\'s all I mean."\r\n\r\n\'Tis not so easy to be always together and always agree.\r\n\r\nAxel went on: "When I bought that place after your father, \'twas\r\nthinking maybe you\'d like better to be there, and so we could shift.\r\nWhat d\'you think?"\r\n\r\nHo, there he gave himself away; he was afraid of losing her and being\r\nleft without help, with none to look to the place and the animals\r\nagain--she knew! "Ay, you\'ve said that before," she answered coldly.\r\n\r\n"Ay, so I have; but I\'ve got no answer."\r\n\r\n"Answer?" said she. "Oh, I\'m sick of hearing it."\r\n\r\nAxel might fairly consider he had been lenient; he had let Brede and\r\nhis family stay on at Breidablik, and for all that he had bought the\r\ngood crop with the place, he had carted home no more than a few loads\r\nof hay, and left the potatoes to them. It was all unreasonable of\r\nBarbro to be contrary now; but she paid no heed to that, and asked\r\nindignantly: "So you\'d have us move down to Breidablik now, and turn\r\nout a whole family to be homeless?"\r\n\r\nHad he heard aright? He sat for a moment staring and gaping, cleared\r\nhis throat as if to answer thoroughly, but it came to nothing; he only\r\nasked: "Aren\'t they going to the village, then?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t ask me," said Barbro. "Or perhaps you\'ve got a place for them\r\nto be there?"\r\n\r\nAxel was still loth to quarrel with her, but he could not help letting\r\nher see he was surprised at her, just a little surprised. "You\'re\r\ngetting more and more cross and hard," said he, "though you don\'t mean\r\nany harm, belike."\r\n\r\n"I mean every word I say," she answered. "And why couldn\'t you have\r\nlet my folks come up here?--answer me that! Then I\'d have had mother\r\nto help me a bit. But you think, perhaps, I\'ve so little to do, I\'ve\r\nno need of help?"\r\n\r\nThere was some sense in this, of course, but also much that was\r\nunreasonable altogether. If Bredes had come, they would have had to\r\nlive in the hut, and Axel would have had no place for his beasts--as\r\nbadly off as before. What was the woman getting at?--had she neither\r\nsense nor wit in her head?\r\n\r\n"Look here," said he, "you\'d better have a servant-girl to help."\r\n\r\n"Now--with the winter coming on and less to do than ever? No, you\r\nshould have thought of that when I needed it."\r\n\r\nHere, again, she was right in a way; when she had been heavy and\r\nailing--that was the time to talk of help. But then Barbro herself had\r\ndone her work all the time as if nothing were the matter; she had been\r\nquick and clever as usual, did all that had to be done, and had never\r\nspoken a word about getting help.\r\n\r\n"Well, I can\'t make it out, anyway," said he hopelessly.\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\nBarbro asked: "What\'s this about you taking over the telegraph after\r\nfather?"\r\n\r\n"What? Who said a word about that?"\r\n\r\n"Well, they say it\'s to be."\r\n\r\n"Why," said Axel, "it may come to something; I\'ll not say no."\r\n\r\n"Ho!"\r\n\r\nBut why d\'you ask?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing," said Barbro; "only that you\'ve turned my father out of\r\nhouse and home, and now you\'re taking the bread out of his mouth."\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\nOh, but that was the end of Axel\'s patience. "I\'ll tell you this," he\r\ncried, "you\'re not worth all I\'ve done for you and yours!"\r\n\r\n"Ho!" said Barbro.\r\n\r\n"No!" said he, striking his fist on the table. And then he got up.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t frighten me, so don\'t think," whimpered Barbro, and moved\r\nover nearer the wall.\r\n\r\n"Frighten you?" he said again, and sniffed scornfully. "I\'m going to\r\nspeak out now in earnest. What about that child? Did you drown it?"\r\n\r\n"Drown it?"\r\n\r\n"Ay. It\'s been in the water."\r\n\r\n"Ho, so you\'ve seen it? You\'ve been--" "sniffing at it," she was going\r\nto say, but dared not; Axel was not to be played with just then, by\r\nhis looks. "You\'ve been and found it?"\r\n\r\n"I saw it had been in the water."\r\n\r\n"Ay," said she, "and well it might. \'Twas born in the water; I slipped\r\nin and couldn\'t get up again."\r\n\r\n"Slipped, did you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and the child came before I could get out."\r\n\r\n"H\'m," said he. "But you took the bit of wrapping with you before you\r\nwent out--was that in case you should happen to fall in?"\r\n\r\n"Wrapping?" said she again.\r\n\r\n"A bit of white rag--one of my shirts you\'d cut half across."\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Barbro, "\'twas a bit of rag I took with me to carry back\r\njuniper twigs in."\r\n\r\n"Juniper twigs?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Didn\'t I tell you that was what I\'d been for?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, so you said. Or else it was twigs for a broom."\r\n\r\n"Well, no matter what it was...."\r\n\r\nIt was an open quarrel between them this time. But even that died\r\naway after a time, and all was well again. That is to say, not well\r\nexactly--no, but passable. Barbro was careful and more submissive; she\r\nknew there was danger. But that way, life at Maaneland grew even more\r\nforced and intolerable--no frankness, no joy between them, always on\r\nguard. It could not last long, but as long as it lasted at all, Axel\r\nwas forced to be content. He had got this girl on the place, and had\r\nwanted her for himself and had her, tied his life to her; it was not\r\nan easy matter to alter all that. Barbro knew everything about the\r\nplace: where pots and vessels stood, when cows and goats were to bear,\r\nif the winter feed would be short or plenty, how much milk was for\r\ncheese and how much for food--a stranger would know nothing of it all,\r\nand even so, a stranger was perhaps not to be had.\r\n\r\nOh, but Axel had thought many a time of getting rid of Barbro and\r\ntaking another girl to help; she was a wicked thing at times, and he\r\nwas almost afraid of her. Even when he had the misfortune to get on\r\nwell with her he drew back at times in fear of her strange cruelty\r\nand brutal ways; but she was pretty to look at, and could be sweet at\r\ntimes, and bury him deep in her arms. So it had been--but that was\r\nover now. No, thank you--Barbro was not going to have all that\r\nmiserable business over again. But it was not so easy to change....\r\n"Let\'s get married at once, then," said Axel, urging her.\r\n\r\n"At once?" said she. "Nay; I must go into town first about my teeth,\r\nthey\'re all but gone as it is."\r\n\r\nSo there was nothing to do but go on as before. And Barbro had no real\r\nwages now, but far beyond what her wages would have been; and every\r\ntime she asked for money and he gave it, she thanked him as for\r\na gift. But for all that Axel could not make out where the money\r\nwent--what could she want money for out in the wilds? Was she hoarding\r\nfor herself? But what on earth was there to save and save for, all the\r\nyear round?\r\n\r\nThere was much that Axel could not make out. Hadn\'t he given her a\r\nring--ay, a real gold ring? And they had got on well together, too,\r\nafter that last gift; but it could not last for ever, far from it; and\r\nhe could not go on buying rings to give her. In a word--did she mean\r\nto throw him over? Women were strange creatures! Was there a man\r\nwith a good farm and a well-stocked place of his own waiting for her\r\nsomewhere else? Axel could at times go so far as to strike his fist on\r\nthe table in his impatience with women and their foolish humours.\r\n\r\nA strange thing, Barbro seemed to have nothing really in her head but\r\nthe thought of Bergen and town life. Well and good. But if so, why had\r\nshe come back at all, confound her! A telegram from her father would\r\nnever have moved her a step in itself; she must have had some other\r\nreason. And now here she was, eternally discontented from morning to\r\nnight, year after year. All these wooden buckets, instead of proper\r\niron pails; cooking-pots instead of saucepans; the everlasting milking\r\ninstead of a little walk round to the dairy; heavy boots, yellow soap,\r\na pillow stuffed with hay; no military bands, no people. Living like\r\nthis....\r\n\r\nThey had many little bouts after the one big quarrel. Ho, time and\r\nagain they were at it! "You say no more about it, if you\'re wise,"\r\nsaid Barbro. "And not to speak of what you\'ve done about father and\r\nall."\r\n\r\nSaid Axel: "Well, what have I done?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you know well enough," said she. "But for all that you\'ll not be\r\nInspector, anyway."\r\n\r\n"Ho!"\r\n\r\n"No, that you won\'t. I\'ll believe it when I see it."\r\n\r\n"Meaning I\'m not good enough, perhaps?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, good enough and good enough.... Anyway, you can\'t read nor write,\r\nand never so much as take a newspaper to look at."\r\n\r\n"As to that," said he, "I can read and write all I\'ve any need for.\r\nBut as for you, with all your gabble and talk ... I\'m sick of it."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, here\'s that to begin with," said she, and threw down the\r\nsilver ring on the table.\r\n\r\n"Ho!" said he, after a while. "And what about the other?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, if you want your rings back that you gave me, you can have them,"\r\nsaid she, trying to pull off the gold one.\r\n\r\n"You can be as nasty as you please," said he. "If you think I\r\ncare...." And he went out.\r\n\r\nAnd naturally enough, soon after, Barbro was wearing both her rings\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIn time, too, she ceased to care at all for what he said about the\r\ndeath of the child. She simply sniffed and tossed her head. Not that\r\nshe ever confessed anything, but only said: "Well, and suppose I had\r\ndrowned it? You live here in the wilds and what do you know of things\r\nelsewhere?" Once when they were talking of this, she seemed to be\r\ntrying to get him to see he was taking it all too seriously; she\r\nherself thought no more of getting rid of a child than the matter was\r\nworth. She knew two girls in Bergen who had done it; but one of them\r\nhad got two months\' imprisonment because she had been a fool and\r\nhadn\'t killed it, but only left it out to freeze to death; and the\r\nother had been acquitted. "No," said Barbro, "the law\'s not so cruel\r\nhard now as it used to be. And besides, it\'s not always it gets found\r\nout." There was a girl in Bergen at the hotel who had killed two\r\nchildren; she was from Christiania, and wore a hat--a hat with\r\nfeathers in. They had given her three months for the second one, but\r\nthe first was never discovered, said Barbro.\r\n\r\nAxel listened to all this and grew more than ever afraid of her. He\r\ntried to understand, to make out things a little in the darkness, but\r\nshe was right after all; he took these things too seriously in his\r\nway. With all her vulgar depravity, Barbro was not worth a single\r\nearnest thought. Infanticide meant nothing to her, there was nothing\r\nextraordinary in the killing of a child; she thought of it only\r\nwith the looseness and moral nastiness that was to be expected of a\r\nservant-girl. It was plain, too, in the days that followed; never an\r\nhour did she give herself up to thought; she was easy and natural as\r\never, unalterably shallow and foolish, unalterably a servant-girl. "I\r\nmust go and have my teeth seen to," she said. "And I want one of those\r\nnew cloaks." There was a new kind of half-length coat that had been\r\nfashionable for some years past, and Barbro must have one.\r\n\r\nAnd when she took it all so naturally, what could Axel do but give\r\nway? And it was not always that he had any real suspicion of her; she\r\nherself had never confessed, had indeed denied time and again,\r\nbut without indignation, without insistence, as a trifle, as a\r\nservant-girl would have denied having broken a dish, whether she had\r\ndone so or not. But after a couple of weeks, Axel could stand it no\r\nlonger; he stopped dead one day in the middle of the room and saw it\r\nall as by a revelation. Great Heaven! every one must have seen how\r\nit was with her, heavy with child and plain to see--and now with her\r\nfigure as before--but where was the child? Suppose others came to look\r\nfor it? They would be asking about it sooner or later. And if there\r\nhad been nothing wrong, it would have been far better to have had the\r\nchild buried decently in the churchyard. Not there in the bushes,\r\nthere on his land....\r\n\r\n"No. \'Twould only have made a fuss," said Barbro. "They\'d have cut it\r\nopen and had an inquest, and all that. I didn\'t want to be bothered."\r\n\r\n"If only it mayn\'t come to worse later on," said he.\r\n\r\nBarbro asked easily: "What\'s there to worry about? Let it lie where it\r\nis." Ay, she smiled, and asked: "Are you afraid it\'ll come after you?\r\nLeave all that nonsense, and say no more about it."\r\n\r\n"Ay, well...."\r\n\r\n"Did I drown the child? I\'ve told you it drowned itself in the water\r\nwhen I slipped in. I never heard such things as you get in your head.\r\nAnd, anyway, it would never be found out," said she.\r\n\r\n"\'Twas found out all the same with Inger at Sellanraa," said Axel.\r\n\r\nBarbro thought for a moment. "Well, I don\'t care," said she. "The\r\nlaw\'s all different now, and if you read the papers you\'d know.\r\nThere\'s heaps that have done it, and don\'t get anything to speak of."\r\nBarbro sets out to explain it, to teach him, as it were--getting him\r\nto take a broad view of things. It was not for nothing she herself had\r\nbeen out in the world and seen and heard and learned so much; now she\r\ncould sit here and be more than a match for him. She had three main\r\narguments which she was continually advancing: In the first place,\r\nshe had not done it. In the second, it was not such a terrible thing,\r\nafter all, if she had done it. But in the third place, it would never\r\nbe found out.\r\n\r\n"Everything gets found out, seems to me," he objected.\r\n\r\n"Not by a long way," she answered. And whether to astonish him or to\r\nencourage him, or perhaps from sheer vanity and as something to boast\r\nof, all of a sudden she threw a bombshell. Thus: "I\'ve done something\r\nmyself that never got found out."\r\n\r\n"You?" said he, all unbelieving. "What have you done?"\r\n\r\n"What have I done? Killed something."\r\n\r\nShe had not meant, perhaps, to go so far, but she had to go on now;\r\nthere he was, staring at her. Oh, and it was not grand, indomitable\r\nboldness even; it was mere bravado, vulgar showing off; she wanted to\r\nlook big herself, and silence him. "You don\'t believe me?" she cried.\r\n"D\'you remember that in the paper about the body of a child found in\r\nthe harbour? \'Twas me that did it."\r\n\r\n"What?" said he.\r\n\r\n"Body of a child. You never remember anything. We read about it in the\r\npaper you brought up."\r\n\r\nAfter a moment he burst out: "You must be out of your senses!"\r\n\r\nBut his confusion seemed to incite her more, to give her a sort of\r\nartificial strength; she could even give the details. "I had it in my\r\nbox--it was dead then, of course--I did that as soon as it was born.\r\nAnd when we got out into the harbour, I threw it overboard."\r\n\r\nAxel sat dark and silent, but she went on. It was a long time back\r\nnow, many years, the time she had first come to Maaneland. So, there,\r\nhe could see \'twas not everything was found out, not by a long way!\r\nWhat would things be like if everything folk did got out? What about\r\nall the married people in the towns and the things they did? They\r\nkilled their children before they were born--there were doctors who\r\nmanaged that. They didn\'t want more than one, or at most two children,\r\nand so they\'d get in a doctor to get rid of it before it come. Ho,\r\nAxel need not think that was such a great affair out in the world!\r\n\r\n"Ho!" said Axel. "Then I suppose you did get rid of the last one too,\r\nthat way?"\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t," she answered carelessly as could be, "for I dropped\r\nit," she said. But even then she must go on again about it being\r\nnothing so terrible if she had. She was plainly accustomed to think of\r\nthe thing as natural and easy; it did not affect her now. The first\r\ntime, perhaps, it might have been a little uncomfortable, something of\r\nan awkward feeling about it, to kill the child; but the second? She\r\ncould think of it now with a sort of historic sense: as a thing that\r\nhad been done, and could be done.\r\n\r\nAxel went out of the house heavy in mind. He was not so much concerned\r\nover the fact that Barbro had killed her first child--that was nothing\r\nto do with himself. That she had had a child at all before she came\r\nto him was nothing much either; she was no innocent, and had never\r\npretended to be so, far from it. She had made no secret of her\r\nknowledge, and had taught him many things in the dark. Well and good.\r\nBut this last child--he would not willingly have lost it; a tiny boy,\r\na little white creature wrapped up in a rag. If she were guilty of\r\nthat child\'s death, then she had injured him, Axel--broken a tie that\r\nhe prized, and that could not be replaced. But it might be that\r\nhe wronged her, after all: that she _had_ slipped in the water by\r\naccident. But then the wrapping--the bit of shirt she had taken with\r\nher....\r\n\r\nMeantime, the hours passed; dinner-time came, and evening. And when\r\nAxel had gone to bed, and had lain staring into the dark long enough,\r\nhe fell asleep at last, and slept till morning. And then came a new\r\nday, and after that day other days....\r\n\r\nBarbro was the same as ever. She knew so much of the world, and could\r\ntake lightly many little trifles that were terrible and serious things\r\nfor folk in the wilds. It was well in a way; she was clever enough for\r\nboth of them, careless enough for both. And she did not go about like\r\na terrible creature herself. Barbro a monster? Not in the least. She\r\nwas a pretty girl, with blue eyes, a slightly turned-up nose, and\r\nquick-handed at her work. She was utterly sick and tired of the farm\r\nand the wooden vessels, that took such a lot of cleaning; sick and\r\ntired, perhaps, of Axel and all, of the out-of-the-way life she led.\r\nBut she never killed any of the cattle, and Axel never found her\r\nstanding over him with uplifted knife in the middle of the night.\r\n\r\nOnly once it happened that they came to talk again of the body in the\r\nwood. Axel still insisted that it ought to have been buried in the\r\nchurchyard, in consecrated ground; but she maintained as before that\r\nher way was good enough. And then she said something which showed that\r\nshe was reasoned after her fashion--ho, was sharp enough, could see\r\nbeyond the tip of her nose; could think, with the pitiful little brain\r\nof a savage.\r\n\r\n"If it gets found out I\'ll go and talk to the Lensmand; I\'ve been in\r\nservice with him. And Fru Heyerdahl, she\'ll put in a word for me, I\r\nknow. It\'s not every one that can get folk to help them like that, and\r\nthey get off all the same. And then, besides, there\'s father, that\r\nknows all the great folks, and been assistant himself, and all the\r\nrest."\r\n\r\nBut Axel only shook his head.\r\n\r\n"Well, what\'s wrong with that?"\r\n\r\n"D\'you think your father\'d ever be able to do anything?"\r\n\r\n"A lot you know about it!" she cried angrily. "After you\'ve ruined him\r\nand all, taking his farm and the bread out of his mouth."\r\n\r\nShe seemed to have a sort of idea herself that her father\'s reputation\r\nhad suffered of late, and that she might lose by it. And what could\r\nAxel say to that? Nothing. He was a man of peace, a worker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\n\r\n\r\nThat winter, Axel was left to himself again at Maaneland. Barbro was\r\ngone. Ay, that was the end of it.\r\n\r\nHer journey to town would not take long, she said; \'twas not like\r\ngoing to Bergen; but she wasn\'t going to stay on here losing one tooth\r\nafter another, till she\'d a mouth like a calf. "What\'ll it cost?" said\r\nAxel.\r\n\r\n"How do I know?" said she. "But, anyway, it won\'t cost you anything.\r\nI\'ll earn the money myself."\r\n\r\nShe had explained, too, why it was best for her to go just then; there\r\nwere but two cows to milk, and in the spring there would be two more,\r\nbesides all the goats with kids, and the busy season, and work enough\r\nright on till June.\r\n\r\n"Do as you please," said Axel.\r\n\r\nIt was not going to cost him anything, not at all. But she must have\r\nsome money to start with, just a little; there was the journey, and\r\nthe dentist to pay, and besides, she must have one of the new cloaks\r\nand some other little things. But, of course, if he didn\'t care to....\r\n\r\n"You\'ve had money enough up to now," said he.\r\n\r\n"H\'m," said she. "Anyway, it\'s all gone."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you put by anything?"\r\n\r\n"Put by anything? You can look in my box it you like. I never put by\r\nanything in Bergen, and. I got more wages then."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no money to give you," said he.\r\n\r\nHe had but little faith in her ever coming back at all, and she had\r\nplagued him so much with her humours this way and that; he had grown\r\nindifferent at last. And though he gave her money in the end, it was\r\nnothing to speak of; but he took no notice when she packed away\r\nan enormous hoard of food to take with her, and he drove her down\r\nhimself, with her box, to the village to meet the steamer.\r\n\r\nAnd that was done.\r\n\r\nHe could have managed alone on the place, he had learned to do so\r\nbefore, but it was awkward with the cattle; if ever he had to leave\r\nhome, there was none to look to them. The storekeeper in the village\r\nhad urged him to get Oline to come for the winter, she had been at\r\nSellanraa for years before; she was old now, of course, but fit and\r\nable to work. And Axel did send for Oline, but she had not come, and\r\nsent no word.\r\n\r\nMeantime, he worked in the forest, threshed out his little crop of\r\ncorn, and tended his cattle. It was a quiet and lonely life. Now and\r\nagain Sivert from Sellanraa would drive past on his way to and from\r\nthe village, taking down loads of wood, or hides, or farm produce, but\r\nrarely bringing anything up home; there was little they needed to buy\r\nnow at Sellanraa.\r\n\r\nNow and again, too, Brede Olsen would come trudging along, more\r\nfrequently of late--whatever he might be after. It looked as if he\r\nwere trying to make himself indispensable to the telegraph people in\r\nthe little time that remained, so as to keep his job. He never came in\r\nto see Axel now that Barbro was gone, but went straight by--a piece of\r\nhigh-and-mightiness ill fitted to his state, seeing that he was still\r\nliving on at Breidablik and had not moved. One day, when he was\r\npassing without so much as a word of greeting, Axel stopped him, and\r\nasked when he had thought of getting out of the place.\r\n\r\n"What about Barbro, and the way she left you?" asked Brede in return.\r\nAnd one word led to another: "You sent her off with neither help nor\r\nmeans, \'twas a near thing but she never got to Bergen at all."\r\n\r\n"Ho! So she\'s in Bergen, is she?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, got there at last, so she writes, but little thanks to you."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have you out of Breidablik, and that sharp," said Axel.\r\n\r\n"Ay, if you\'d be so kind," said the other, with a sneer. "But we\'ll be\r\ngoing of ourselves at the new year," he said, and went on his way.\r\n\r\nSo Barbro was gone to Bergen--ay, \'twas as Axel had thought. He did\r\nnot take it to heart. Take it to heart? No, indeed; he was well rid of\r\nher. But for all that, he had hoped a little until then that she might\r\ncome back. \'Twas all unreasonable, but somehow he had come to care\r\novermuch for the girl--ay, for that devil of a girl. She had her sweet\r\nmoments, unforgettable moments, and it was on purpose to hinder her\r\nfrom running off to Bergen that he had given her so little money\r\nfor the journey. And now she had gone there after all. A few of her\r\nclothes still hung in the house, and there was a straw hat with birds\'\r\nwings on, wrapped up in a paper, in the loft, but she did not come to\r\nfetch them. Eyah, maybe he took it to heart a little, only a little.\r\nAnd as if to jeer at him, as a mighty jest in his trouble, came the\r\npaper he had ordered for her every week, and it would not stop now\r\ntill the new year.\r\n\r\nWell, well, there were other things to think about. He must be a man.\r\n\r\nNext spring he would have to put up a shed against the north wall of\r\nthe house; the timber would have to be felled that winter, and the\r\nplanks cut. Axel had no timber to speak of, not growing close, but\r\nthere were some heavy firs scattered about here and there on the\r\noutskirts of his land, and he marked out those on the side toward\r\nSellanraa, to have the shortest way to cart his timber up to the\r\nsawmill.\r\n\r\nAnd so one morning he gives the beasts an extra feed, to last them\r\ntill the evening, shuts all doors behind him, and goes out felling\r\ntrees. Besides his ax and a basket of food, he carried a rake to clear\r\nthe snow away. The weather was mild, there had been a heavy snowstorm\r\nthe day before, but now it had stopped. He follows the telegraph line\r\nall the way to the spot, then pulls off his jacket and falls to work.\r\nAs the trees are felled, he strips off the branches, leaving the clean\r\ntrunks, and piles up the small wood in heaps.\r\n\r\nBrede Olsen comes by on his way up--trouble on the line, no doubt,\r\nafter yesterday\'s storm. Or maybe Brede was out on no particular\r\nerrand, but simply from pure zeal--ho, he was mighty keen on his duty\r\nof late, was Brede! The two men did not speak, did not so much as lift\r\na hand in greeting.\r\n\r\nThe weather is changing again, the wind is getting up. Axel marks it,\r\nbut goes on with his work. It is long past noon, and he has not yet\r\neaten. Then, felling a big fir, he manages to get in the way of its\r\nfall, and is thrown to the ground. He hardly knew how it happened--but\r\nthere it was. A big fir swaying from the root: a man will have it fall\r\none way, the storm says another--and the storm it is that wins. He\r\nmight have got clear after all, but the lie of the ground was hidden\r\nby snow. Axel made a false step, lost his footing, and came down in a\r\ncleft of rock, astride of a boulder, pinned down by the weight of a\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nWell, and what then? He might still have got clear, but, as it\r\nchanced, he had fallen awkwardly as could be--no bones broken, as far\r\nas he could tell, but twisted somehow, and unable to drag himself out.\r\nAfter a while he gets one hand free, supporting himself on the other,\r\nbut the ax is beyond his reach. He looks round, takes thought, as any\r\nother beast in a trap would do; looks round and takes thought and\r\ntries to work his way out from under the tree. Brede must be coming by\r\non his way down before long, he thinks to himself, and gives himself a\r\nbreathing-space.\r\n\r\nHe does not let it trouble him much at first, it was only annoying to\r\nlose time at his work; there is no thought in his mind of being in\r\ndanger, let alone in peril of his life. True, he can feel the hand\r\nthat supports him growing numbed and dead, his foot in the cleft\r\ngrowing cold and helpless too; but no matter, Brede must be here soon.\r\n\r\nBrede did not come.\r\n\r\nThe storm increased, Axel felt the snow driving full in his face.\r\nHo, \'tis coming down in earnest now, says he to himself, still never\r\ntroubling much about it all--ay, \'tis as if he blinks at himself\r\nthrough the snow, to look out, for now things are beginning in\r\nearnest! After a long while he gives a single shout. The sound would\r\nhardly carry far in the gale, but it would be upward along the line,\r\ntowards Brede. Axel lies there with all sorts of vain and useless\r\nthoughts in his head: if only he could reach the ax, and perhaps cut\r\nhis way out! If he could only get his hand up--it was pressing against\r\nsomething sharp, an edge of stone, and the stone was eating its way\r\nquietly and politely into the back of his hand. Anyhow, if only that\r\ninfernal stone itself had not been there--but no one has ever yet\r\nheard tell of such a touching act of kindness on the part of a stone.\r\n\r\nGetting late now, getting later, the snow drifting thick; Axel\r\nis getting snowed up himself. The snow packs all innocently, all\r\nunknowing, about his face, melting at first, till the flesh grows\r\ncold, and then it melts no longer. Ay, now \'tis beginning in earnest!\r\n\r\nHe gives two great shouts, and listens.\r\n\r\nHis ax is getting snowed up now; he can see but a bit of the haft.\r\nOver there is his basket of food, hung on a tree--if he could but have\r\nreached it, and had a feed--oh, huge big mouthfuls! And then he goes\r\none step farther in his demands, and asks yet more: if he only had his\r\ncoat on--it is getting cold. He gives another swinging shout....\r\n\r\nAnd there is Brede. Stopped in his tracks, standing still, looking\r\ntoward the man as he calls; he stands there but for a moment, glancing\r\nthat way, as if to see what is amiss.\r\n\r\n"Reach me the ax here, will you?" calls Axel, a trifle weakly.\r\n\r\nBrede looks away hurriedly, fully aware now of what is the matter; he\r\nglances up at the telegraph wires and seems to be whistling. What can\r\nhe mean by that?\r\n\r\n"Here, reach me the ax, can\'t you?" cries Axel louder. "I\'m pinned\r\nhere under a tree."\r\n\r\nBut Brede is strangely full of zeal in his duty now, he keeps on\r\nlooking at the telegraph wires, and whistling all the time. Note,\r\nalso, that he seems to be whistling gaily, as it were vengefully.\r\n\r\n"Ho, so you\'re going to murder me--won\'t even reach me the ax?" cries\r\nAxel. And at that it seems as if there is trouble farther down the\r\nline, which Brede must see to without delay. He moves off, and is lost\r\nto sight in the driving snow.\r\n\r\nHo--well and good! But after that, well, it would just serve things\r\ngenerally right if Axel were to manage by himself after all, and get\r\nat the ax without help from any one. He strains all the muscles of his\r\nchest to lift the huge weight that bears him down; the tree moves, he\r\ncan feel it shake, but all he gains by that is a shower of snow. And\r\nafter a few more tries, he gives up.\r\n\r\nGrowing dark now. Brede is gone--but how far can he have got? Axel\r\nshouts again, and lets off a few straightforward words into the\r\nbargain. "Leave me here to die, would you, like a murderer?" he cries.\r\n"Have ye no soul nor thought of what\'s to come? And the worth of a\r\ncow, no less, to lend a helping hand. But \'tis a dog you are and ever\r\nwere, Brede, and leaving a man to die. Ho, but there\'s more shall know\r\nof this, never fear, and true as I\'m lying here. And won\'t even come\r\nand reach me that ax...."\r\n\r\nSilence. Axel strains away at the tree once more, lifts it a little,\r\nand brings down a new shower of snow. Gives it up again and sighs;\r\nhe is worn out now, and getting sleepy. There\'s the cattle at home,\r\nthey\'ll be standing in the hut and bellowing for food, not a bite nor\r\na drop since the morning; no Barbro to look to them now--no. Barbro\'s\r\ngone, run off and gone, and taken both her rings, gold and silver,\r\ntaken them with her. Getting dark now, ay, evening, night; well,\r\nwell.... But there\'s the cold to reckon with too; his beard is\r\nfreezing, soon his eyes will freeze too as well; ay, if he had but his\r\njacket from the tree there ... and now his leg--surely, it can\'t be\r\nthat--but all the same one leg feels dead now up to the hip. "All in\r\nGod\'s hands," he says to himself--seems like he can talk all godly and\r\npious when he will. Getting dark, ay; but a man can die without the\r\nlight of a lamp. He feels all soft and good now, and of sheer humility\r\nhe smiles, foolishly and kindly, at the snowstorm round; \'tis God\'s\r\nown snow, an innocent thing! Ay, he might even forgive Brede, and\r\nnever say a word....\r\n\r\nHe is very quiet now, and growing ever more sleepy, ay, as if some\r\npoison were numbing him all over. And there is too much whiteness to\r\nlook at every way; woods and lands, great wings, white veils, white\r\nsails; white, white ... what can it be? Nonsense, man! And he knows\r\nwell enough it is but snow; he is lying out in the snow; \'tis no fancy\r\nthat he is lying there, pinned down beneath a tree.\r\n\r\nHe shouts again at hazard, throws out a roar; there in the snow a\r\nman\'s great hairy chest swelling to a roar, bellowing so it could be\r\nheard right down at the hut, again and again. "Ay, and a swine and a\r\nmonster," he cries after Brede again; "never a thought of how you\'re\r\nleaving me to lie and be perished. And couldn\'t even reach me the\r\nax, that was all I asked; and call yourself a man, or a beast of the\r\nfield? Ay, well then, go your way, and good luck to you if that\'s your\r\nwill and thought to go...."\r\n\r\nHe must have slept; he is all stiff and lifeless now, but his eyes\r\nare open; set in ice, but open, he cannot wing nor blink--has he been\r\nsleeping with open eyes? Dropped off for a second maybe, or for an\r\nhour, God knows, but here\'s Oline standing before him. He can hear her\r\nasking: "In Jesu name, say if there\'s life in you!" And asking him if\r\nit is him lying there, and if he\'s lost his wits or no.\r\n\r\nAlways something of a jackal about Oline; sniffing and scenting out,\r\nalways on the spot where there was trouble; ay, she would nose it out.\r\nAnd how could she ever have managed through life at all if it hadn\'t\r\nbeen that same way? Axel\'s word had reached her, and for all her\r\nseventy years she had crossed the field to come. Snowed up at\r\nSellanraa in the storm of the day before, and then on again to\r\nMaaneland; not a soul on the place; fed the cattle, stood in the\r\ndoorway listening, milked the cows at milking-time, listening again;\r\nwhat could it be?...\r\n\r\nAnd then a cry comes down, and she nods; Axel, maybe, or maybe the\r\nhill-folk, devils--anyway, something to sniff and scent and find--to\r\nworm out the meaning of it all, the wisdom of the Almighty with the\r\ndark and the forest in the hollow of His hand--and He would never harm\r\nOline, that was not worthy to unloose the latchet of His shoes....\r\n\r\nAnd there she stands.\r\n\r\nThe ax? Oline digs down and down in the snow, and finds no ax. Manage\r\nwithout, then--and she strains at the tree to lift it where it lies,\r\nbut with no more strength than a child; she can but shake the branches\r\nhere and there. Tries for the ax again--it is all dark, but she digs\r\nwith hands and feet. Axel cannot move a hand to point, only tell where\r\nit lay before, but \'tis not there now. "If it hadn\'t been so far to\r\nSellanraa," says Axel.\r\n\r\nThen Oline falls to searching her own ways, and Axel calls to her that\r\nthere\'s no ax there. "Ay, well," says Oline, "I was but looking a bit.\r\nAnd what\'s this, maybe?" says she.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve found it?" says he.\r\n\r\n"Ay, by the grace of the Lord Almighty," answers Oline, with\r\nhigh-sounding words.\r\n\r\nBut there\'s little pride in Axel now, no more than he\'ll give in that\r\nhe was wrong after all, and maybe not all clear in his head. And\r\nwhat\'s he to do with the ax now \'tis there? He cannot stir, and Oline\r\nhas to cut him free herself. Oh, Oline has wielded an ax before that\r\nday; had axed off many a load of firing in her life.\r\n\r\nAxel cannot walk, one leg is dead to the hip, and something wrong with\r\nhis back; shooting pains that make him groan curiously--ay, he feels\r\nbut a part of himself, as if something were left behind there under\r\nthe tree. "Don\'t know," says he--"don\'t know what it can be...." But\r\nOline knows, and tells him now with solemn words; ay, for she has\r\nsaved a human creature from death, and she knows it; \'tis the Almighty\r\nhas seen fit to lay on her this charge, where He might have sent\r\nlegions of angels. Let Axel consider the grace and infinite wisdom of\r\nthe Almighty even in this! And if so be as it had been His pleasure to\r\nsend a worm out of the earth instead, all things were possible to Him.\r\n\r\n"Ay, I know," said Axel. "But I can\'t make out how \'tis with me--feels\r\nstrange...."\r\n\r\nFeels strange, does it? Oh, but only wait, wait just a little. \'Twas\r\nbut to move and stretch the least bit at a time, till the life came\r\nback. And get his jacket on and get warm again. But never in all her\r\ndays would she forget how the Angel of the Lord had called her out to\r\nthe doorway that last time, that she might hear a voice--the voice of\r\none crying in the forest. Ay, \'twas as in the days of Paradise, when\r\ntrumpets blew and compassed round the walls of Jericho....\r\n\r\nAy, strange. But while she talked, Axel was taking his time, learning\r\nthe use of his limbs again, getting to walk.\r\n\r\nThey get along slowly towards home, Oline still playing saviour and\r\nsupporting him. They manage somehow. A little farther down they come\r\nupon Brede. "What\'s here?" says Brede. "Hurt yourself? Let me help a\r\nbit."\r\n\r\nAxel takes no heed. He had given a promise to God not to be vengeful,\r\nnot to tell of what Brede had done, but beyond that he was free. And\r\nwhat was Brede going up that way again for now? Had he seen that Oline\r\nwas at Maaneland, and guessed that she would hear?\r\n\r\n"And it\'s you here, Oline, is it?" goes on Brede easily. "Where d\'you\r\nfind him? Under a tree? Well, now, \'tis a curious thing," says he. "I\r\nwas up that way just now on duty, along the line, and seems like\r\nI heard some one shouting. Turns round and listens quick as a\r\nflash--Brede\'s the man to lend a hand if there\'s need. And so \'twas\r\nAxel, was it, lying under a tree, d\'you say?"\r\n\r\n"Ay," says Axel. "And well you knew that saw and heard as well. But\r\nnever helping hand...."\r\n\r\n"Good Lord, deliver us!" cries Oline, aghast. "As I\'m a sinner...."\r\n\r\nBrede explains. "Saw? Why, yes, I saw you right enough. But why didn\'t\r\nyou call out? You might have called out if there was anything wrong. I\r\nsaw you right enough, ay, but never thought but you were lying down a\r\nbit to rest."\r\n\r\n"You\'d better say no more," says Axel warningly. "You know well enough\r\nyou left me there and hoping I\'d never rise again."\r\n\r\nOline sees her way now; Brede must not be allowed to interfere. She\r\nmust be indispensable, nothing can come between her and Axel that\r\ncould make him less completely indebted to herself. She had saved him,\r\nshe alone. And she waves Brede aside; will not even let him carry the\r\nax or the basket of food. Oh, for the moment she is all on Axel\'s\r\nside--but next time she comes to Brede and sits talking to him over a\r\ncup of coffee, she will be on his.\r\n\r\n"Let me carry the ax and things, anyway," says Brede.\r\n\r\n"Nay," says Oline, speaking for Axel. "He\'ll take them himself."\r\n\r\nAnd Brede goes on again: "You might have called to me, anyway; we\'re\r\nnot so deadly enemies that you couldn\'t say a word to a man?--You did\r\ncall? Well, you might have shouted then, so a man could hear. Blowing\r\na gale and all.... Leastways, you might have waved a hand."\r\n\r\n"I\'d no hand to wave," answers Axel. "You saw how \'twas with me, shut\r\ndown and locked in all ways."\r\n\r\n"Nay, that I\'ll swear I didn\'t. Well, I never heard. Here, let me\r\ncarry those things."\r\n\r\nOline puts in: "Leave him alone. He\'s hurt and poorly."\r\n\r\nBut Axel\'s mind is getting to work again now. He has heard of Oline\r\nbefore, and understands it will be a costly thing for him, and a\r\nplague besides, if she can claim to have saved his life all by\r\nherself. Better to share between them as far as may be. And he lets\r\nBrede take the basket and the tools; ay, he lets it be understood that\r\nthis is a relief, that it eases him to get rid of it. But Oline will\r\nnot have it, she snatches away the basket, she and no other will carry\r\nwhat\'s to be carried there. Sly simplicity at war on every side. Axel\r\nis left for a moment without support, and Brede has to drop the basket\r\nand hold him, though Axel can stand by himself now, it seems.\r\n\r\nThen they go on a bit that way, Brede holding Axel\'s arm, and Oline\r\ncarrying the things. Carrying, carrying, full of bitterness and\r\nflashing fire; a miserable part indeed, to carry a basket instead\r\nof leading a helpless man. What did Brede want coming that way at\r\nall--devil of a man!\r\n\r\n"Brede," says she, "what\'s it they\'re saying, you\'ve sold your place\r\nand all?"\r\n\r\n"And who\'s it wants to know?" says Brede boldly.\r\n\r\n"Why, as to that, I\'d never thought \'twas any secret not to be known."\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you come to the sale, then, and bid with the rest?"\r\n\r\n"Me--ay, \'tis like you to make a jest of poor folk."\r\n\r\n"Well, and I thought \'twas you had grown rich and grand. Wasn\'t it you\r\nhad left you old Sivert\'s chest and all his money in? He he he!"\r\n\r\nOline was not pleased, not softened at being minded of that legacy.\r\n"Ay, old Sivert, he\'d a kindly thought for me, and I\'ll not say\r\notherwise. But once he was dead and gone, \'twas little they left after\r\nhim in worldly goods. And you know yourself how \'tis to be stripped of\r\nall, and live under other man\'s roof; but old Sivert he\'s in palaces\r\nand mansions now, and the likes of you and me are left on earth to be\r\nspurned underfoot."\r\n\r\n"Ho, you and your talk!" says Brede scornfully, and turns to Axel:\r\n"Well, I\'m glad I came in time--help you back home. Not going too\r\nfast, eh?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\nTalk to Oline, stand up and argue with Oline! Was never a man could\r\ndo it but to his cost. Never in life would she give in, and never her\r\nmatch for turning and twisting heaven and earth to a medley of seeming\r\nkindness and malice, poison and senseless words. This to her face now:\r\nBrede making as if \'twas himself was bringing Axel home!\r\n\r\n"What I was going to say," she begins: "They gentlemen came up to\r\nSellanraa that time; did you ever get to show them all those sacks of\r\nstone you\'d got, eh, Brede?"\r\n\r\n"Axel," says Brede, "let me hoist you on my shoulders, and I\'ll carry\r\nyou down rest of the way."\r\n\r\n"Nay," says Axel. "For all it\'s good of you to ask."\r\n\r\nSo they go on; not far now to go. Oline must make the best of her time\r\non the way. "Better if you\'d saved him at the point of death," says\r\nshe. "And how was it, Brede, you coming by and seeing him in deadly\r\nperil and heard his cry and never stopped to help?"\r\n\r\n"You hold your tongue," says Brede.\r\n\r\nAnd it might have been easier for her if she had, wading deep in snow\r\nand out of breath, and a heavy burden and all, but \'twas not Oline\'s\r\nway to hold her tongue. She\'d a bit in reserve, a dainty morsel. Ho,\r\n\'twas a dangerous thing to talk of, but she dared it.\r\n\r\n"There\'s Barbro now," says she. "And how\'s it with her? Not run off\r\nand away, perhaps?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, she has," answers Brede carelessly. "And left a place for you for\r\nthe winter by the same."\r\n\r\nBut here was a first-rate opening for Oline again; she could let it be\r\nseen now what a personage she was; how none could manage long without\r\nOline--Oline, that, had to be sent for near or far. She might\r\nhave been two places, ay, three, for that matter. There was the\r\nparsonage--they\'d have been glad to have her there, too. And here was\r\nanother thing--ay, let Axel hear it too, \'twould do no harm--they\'d\r\noffered her so-and-so much for the winter, not to speak of a new pair\r\nof shoes and a sheepskin into the bargain. But she knew what she was\r\ndoing, coming to Maaneland, coming to a man that was lordly to give\r\nand would pay her over and above what other folk did--and so she\'d\r\ncome. No, \'twas no need for Brede to trouble himself that gait--when\r\nher Heavenly Father had watched over her all those years, and opened\r\nthis door and that before her feet, and bidden her in. Ay, and it\r\nseemed like God Himself had known what He was doing, sending her up\r\nto Maaneland that day, to save the life of one of His creatures on\r\nearth....\r\n\r\nAxel was getting wearied again by now; his legs could hardly bear him,\r\nand seemed like giving up. Strange, he had been getting better by\r\ndegrees, able to walk, as the life and warmth came back into his body.\r\nBut now--he must lean on Brede for support! It seemed to begin when\r\nOline started talking about her wages; and then, when she was saving\r\nhis life again, it was worse than ever. Was he trying to lessen her\r\ntriumph once more? Heaven knows--but his mind seemed to be working\r\nagain. As they neared the house, he stopped, and said: "Looks like\r\nI\'ll never get there, after all."\r\n\r\nBrede hoists him up without a word, and carries him. So they go on\r\nlike that, Oline all venom, Axel up full length on Brede\'s back.\r\n\r\n"What I was going to say," gets out Oline--"about Barbro--wasn\'t she\r\nfar gone with child?"\r\n\r\n"Child?" groans Brede, under the weight. Oh, \'tis a strange\r\nprocession; but Axel lets himself be carried all the way till he\'s set\r\ndown at his own door.\r\n\r\nBrede puffs and blows, mightily out of breath.\r\n\r\n"Ay, or how--was it ever born, after all?" asks Oline.\r\n\r\nAxel cuts in quickly with a word to Brede: "I don\'t know how I\'d ever\r\nhave got home this night but for you." And he does not forget Oline:\r\n"And you, Oline, that was the first to find me. I\'ve to thank you both\r\nfor it all."\r\n\r\nThat was how Axel was saved....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next few days Oline would talk of nothing but the great event;\r\nAxel was hard put to it to keep her within bounds. Oline can point out\r\nthe very spot where she was standing in the room when an angel of the\r\nLord called her out to the door to hear a cry for help--Axel goes\r\nback to his work in the woods, and when he has felled enough, begins\r\ncarting it up to the sawmill at Sellanraa.\r\n\r\nGood, regular winter work, as long as it lasts; carting up rough\r\ntimber and bringing back sawn planks. The great thing is to hurry and\r\nget through with it before the new year, when the frost sets in\r\nin earnest, and the saw cannot work. Things are going on nicely,\r\neverything as well as could be wished. If Sivert happens to come up\r\nfrom the village with an empty sledge, he stops and takes a stick of\r\ntimber on the way, to help his neighbour. And the pair of them talk\r\nover things together, and each is glad of a talk with the other.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the news down village?" asks Axel.\r\n\r\n"Why, nothing much," says Sivert. "There\'s a new man coming to take up\r\nland, so they say."\r\n\r\nA new man--nothing in that; \'twas only Sivert\'s way of putting it. New\r\nmen came now every year or so, to take up land; there were five new\r\nholdings now below Breidablik. Higher up, things went more slowly,\r\nfor all that the soil was richer that way. The one who had ventured\r\nfarthest was Isak, when he settled down at Sellanraa; he was the\r\nboldest and the wisest of them all. Later, Axel Stroem had come--and\r\nnow there was a new man besides. The new man was to have a big patch\r\nof arable land and forest down below Maaneland--there was land enough.\r\n\r\n"Heard what sort of a man it is?" asked Axel.\r\n\r\n"Nay," said Sivert. "But he\'s bringing up houses all ready made, to\r\nfix up in no time."\r\n\r\n"Ho! A rich man, then?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, seems like. And a wife and three children with him; and horse and\r\ncattle."\r\n\r\n"Why, then, \'twill be a rich man enough. Any more about him?"\r\n\r\n"No. He\'s three-and-thirty."\r\n\r\n"And what\'s his name?"\r\n\r\n"Aron, they say. Calls his place Storborg."\r\n\r\n"Storborg? H\'m. \'Tis no little place, then." [Footnote: "_Stor_" =\r\ngreat]\r\n\r\n"He\'s come up from the coast. Had a fishery there, so they say."\r\n\r\n"H\'m--fishery. Wonder if he knows much about farming?" says Axel.\r\n"That all you heard? Nothing more?"\r\n\r\n"No. He paid all down in cash for the title-deeds. That\'s all I heard.\r\nMust have made a heap of money with his fishery, they say. And now\r\nhe\'s going to start here with a store."\r\n\r\n"Ho! A store?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, so they say."\r\n\r\n"H\'m. So he\'s going to start a store?"\r\n\r\nThis was the one really important piece of news, and the two\r\nneighbours talked it over every way as they drove up. It was a big\r\npiece of news--the greatest event, perhaps, in all the history of the\r\nplace; ay, there was much to say of that. Who was he going to trade\r\nwith, this new man? The eight of them that had settled on the common\r\nlands? Or did he reckon on getting custom from the village as well?\r\nAnyway, the store would mean a lot to them; like as not, it would\r\nbring up more settlers again. The holdings might rise in value--who\r\ncould say?\r\n\r\nThey talked it over as if they would never tire. Ay, here were two men\r\nwith their own interests and aims, as great to them as other men\'s.\r\nThe settlement was their world; work, seasons, crops were the\r\nadventures of their life. Was not that interest and excitement enough?\r\nHo, enough indeed! Many a time they had need to sleep but lightly, to\r\nwork on long past meal-times; but they stood it, they endured it and\r\nwere none the worse; a matter of seven hours lying pinned down beneath\r\na tree was not a thing to spoil them for life as long as their limbs\r\nwere whole. A narrow world, a life with no great prospects? Ho,\r\nindeed! What of this new Storborg, a shop and a store here in the\r\nwilds--was not that prospect enough?\r\n\r\nThey talked it over until Christmas came....\r\n\r\nAxel had got a letter, a big envelope with a lion on it; it was from\r\nthe State. He was to fetch supplies of wire, a telegraph apparatus,\r\ntools and implements, from Brede Olsen, and take over inspection of\r\nthe line from New Year\'s Day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\n\r\n\r\nTeams of horses driving up over the moors, carting up houses for the\r\nnew man come to settle in the wilds; load after load, for days on end.\r\nDump the things down on a spot that is to be called Storborg; \'twill\r\nanswer to its name, no doubt, in time. There are four men already at\r\nwork up in the hills, getting out stone for a wall and two cellars.\r\n\r\nCarting loads, carting new loads. The sides of the house are built and\r\nready beforehand, \'tis only to fix them up when the spring comes; all\r\nreckoned out neatly and accurately in advance, each piece with its\r\nnumber marked, not a door, not a window lacking, even to the coloured\r\nglass for the verandah. And one day a cart comes up with a whole load\r\nof small stakes. What\'s them for? One of the settlers from lower down\r\ncan tell them; he\'s from the south, and has seen the life before.\r\n"\'Tis for a garden fence," says he. So the new man is going to have a\r\ngarden laid out in the wilds--a big garden.\r\n\r\nAll looked well; never before had there been such carting and traffic\r\nup over the moors, and there were many that earned good money letting\r\nout their horses for the work. This, again, was matter for discussion.\r\nThere was the prospect of making money in the future; the trader would\r\nbe getting his goods from different parts; inland or overseas, they\r\nwould have to be carted up from the sea with teams of horses.\r\n\r\nAy, it looked as if things were going to be on a grander scale all\r\nround. Here was a young foreman or manager in charge of the carting\r\nwork; a lordly young spark he was, and grumbled at not getting horses\r\nenough, for all that there were not so many loads to come.\r\n\r\n"But there can\'t be so much more to come now, with the houses all up,"\r\nthey said.\r\n\r\n"Ho, and what about the goods?" he answered.\r\n\r\nSivert from Sellanraa came clattering up homeward, empty as usual, and\r\nthe foreman called to him: "Hi, what are you coming up empty for? Why\r\ndidn\'t you bring up a load for us here?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I might have," said Sivert. "But I\'d no knowledge of it."\r\n\r\n"He\'s from Sellanraa; they\'ve two horses there," some one whispered.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that? You\'ve got two horses?" says the foreman. "Bring them\r\ndown, then, the pair of them, to help with the cartage here. We\'ll pay\r\nyou well."\r\n\r\n"Why," says Sivert, "that\'s none so bad, dare say. But we\'re pressed\r\njust now, and can\'t spare the time."\r\n\r\n"What? Can\'t spare the time to make money!" says the foreman.\r\n\r\nBut they had not always time at Sellanraa, there was much to do on the\r\nplace. They had hired men to help--the first time such a thing had\r\never been done at Sellanraa--two stoneworkers from the Swedish side,\r\nto get out stone for a new cowshed.\r\n\r\nThis had been Isak\'s great idea for years past, to build a proper\r\ncowshed. The turf hut where the cattle were housed at present was too\r\nsmall, and out of repair; he would have a stone-built shed with double\r\nwalls and a proper dung-pit under. It was to be done now. But there\r\nwere many other things to be done as well, one thing always leading to\r\nanother; the building work, at any rate, seemed never to be finished.\r\nHe had a sawmill and a cornmill and a summer shed for the cattle; it\r\nwas but reasonable he should have a smithy. Only a little place, for\r\nodd jobs as need arose; it was a long way to send down to the village\r\nwhen the sledge-hammer curled at the edges or a horseshoe or so\r\nwanted looking to. Just enough to manage with, that was all--and why\r\nshouldn\'t he? Altogether, there were many outbuildings, little and\r\nbig, at Sellanraa.\r\n\r\nThe place is growing, getting bigger and bigger, a mighty big place at\r\nlast. Impossible now to manage without a girl to help, and Jensine has\r\nto stay on. Her father, the blacksmith, asks after her now and again,\r\nif she isn\'t coming home soon; but he does not make a point of it,\r\nbeing an easy-going man, and maybe with his own reasons for letting\r\nher stay. And there is Sellanraa, farthest out of all the settlements,\r\ngrowing bigger and bigger all the time; the place, that is, the houses\r\nand the ground, only the folk are the same. The day is gone when\r\nwandering Lapps could come to the house and get all they wanted for\r\nthe asking; they come but rarely now, seem rather to go a long way\r\nround and keep out of sight; none are even seen inside the house, but\r\nwait without if they come at all. Lapps always keep to the outlying\r\nspots, in dark places; light and air distress them, they cannot\r\nthrive; \'tis with them as with maggots and vermin. Now and again\r\na calf or a lamb disappears without a trace from the outskirts of\r\nSellanraa, from the farthest edge of the land--there is no helping\r\nthat. And Sellanraa can bear the loss. And even if Sivert could shoot,\r\nhe has no gun, but anyway, he cannot shoot; a good-tempered fellow,\r\nnothing warlike; a born jester: "And, anyway, I doubt but there\'s a\r\nlaw against shooting Lapps," says he.\r\n\r\nAy, Sellanraa can bear the loss of a head or so of cattle here and\r\nthere; it stands there, great and strong. But not without its troubles\r\nfor all that. Inger is not altogether pleased with herself and with\r\nlife all the year round, no; once she made a journey to a place a long\r\nway off, and it seems to have left an ugly discontent behind. It\r\nmay disappear for a time, but always it returns. She is clever and\r\nhard-working as in her best days, and a handsome, healthy wife for a\r\nman, for a barge of a man--but has she no memories of Trondhjem; does\r\nshe never dream? Ay, and in winter most of all. Full of life and\r\nspirits at times, and wanting no end of things--but a woman cannot\r\ndance by herself, and so there was no dancing at Sellanraa. Heavy\r\nthoughts and books of devotion? Ay, well.... But there\'s something,\r\nHeaven knows, in the other sort of life, something splendid and\r\nunequalled. She has learned to make do with little; the Swedish\r\nstoneworkers are something, at any rate; strange faces and new voices\r\nabout the place, but they are quiet, elderly men, given to work\r\nrather than play. Still, better than nothing--and one of them sings\r\nbeautifully at his work; Inger stops now and again to listen. Hjalmar\r\nis his name.\r\n\r\nAnd that is not all the trouble at Sellanraa. There is Eleseus, for\r\ninstance--a disappointment there. He had written to say that his place\r\nin the engineer\'s office was no longer open, but he was going to\r\nget another all right--only wait. Then came another letter; he was\r\nexpecting something to turn up very shortly, a first-rate post; but\r\nmeantime, he could not live on nothing at all, and when they sent him\r\na hundred-_Krone_ note from home, he wrote back to say it was just\r\nenough to pay off some small debts he had.... "H\'m," said Isak. "But\r\nwe\'ve these stoneworker folk to pay, and a deal of things ... write\r\nand ask if he wouldn\'t rather come back here and lend a hand."\r\n\r\nAnd Inger wrote, but Eleseus did not care about coming home again; no,\r\nno sense in making another journey all to no purpose; he would rather\r\nstarve.\r\n\r\nWell, perhaps there was no first-rate post vacant just then in the\r\ncity, and Eleseus, perhaps, was not as sharp as a razor in pushing his\r\nway. Heaven knows--perhaps he wasn\'t over clever at his work either.\r\nWrite? ay, he could write well enough, and quick and hard-working\r\nmaybe, but there might be something lacking for all that. And if so,\r\nwhat was to become of him?\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived from home with his two hundred _Kroner_, the city was\r\nwaiting for him with old accounts outstanding, and when those were\r\npaid, well, he had to get a proper walking-stick, and not the remains\r\nof an umbrella. There were other little things as well that were but\r\nreasonable--a fur cap for the winter, like all his companions wore,\r\na pair of skates to go on the ice with as others did, a silver\r\ntoothpick, which was a thing to clean one\'s teeth, and play with\r\ndaintily when chatting with friends over a glass of this or that. And\r\nas long as he had money, he stood treat as far as he was able; at a\r\nfestive evening held to celebrate his return to town, he ordered half\r\na dozen bottles of beer, and had them opened sparingly, one after\r\nanother. "What--twenty _Ore_ for the waitress?" said his friends;\r\n"ten\'s quite enough."\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t do to be stingy," said Eleseus.\r\n\r\nNothing stingy nor mean about Eleseus, no; he come from a good home,\r\nfrom a big place, where his father the Margrave owned endless tracts\r\nof timber, and four horses and thirty cows and three mowing-machines.\r\nEleseus was no liar, and it was not he who had spread abroad all the\r\nfantastic stories about the Sellanraa estate; \'twas the district\r\nsurveyor who had amused himself talking grandly about it a long while\r\nback. But Eleseus was not displeased to find the stories taken more or\r\nless for truth. Being nothing in himself, it was just as well to be\r\nthe son of somebody that counted for something; it gave him credit,\r\nand was useful that way. But it could not last for ever; the day came\r\nwhen he could no longer put off paying, and what was he to do then?\r\nOne of his friends came to his help, got him into his father\'s\r\nbusiness, a general store where the peasants bought their\r\nwares--better than nothing. It was a poor thing for a grown lad to\r\nstart at a beginner\'s wage in a little shop; no short cut to the\r\nposition of a Lensmand; still, it gave him enough to live on, helped\r\nhim over the worst for the present--oh, \'twas not so bad, after all.\r\nEleseus was willing and good-tempered here too, and people liked him;\r\nhe wrote home to say he had gone into trade.\r\n\r\nThis was his mother\'s greatest disappointment. Eleseus serving in a\r\nshop--\'twas not a whit better than being assistant at the store\r\ndown in the village. Before, he had been something apart, something\r\ndifferent from the rest; none of their neighbours had gone off to live\r\nin a town and work in an office. Had he lost sight of his great aim\r\nand end? Inger was no fool; she knew well enough that there was a\r\ndifference between the ordinary and the uncommon, though perhaps she\r\ndid not always think to reckon with it. Isak was simpler and slower of\r\nthought; he reckoned less and less with Eleseus now, when he reckoned\r\nat all; his eldest son was gradually slipping out of range. Isak no\r\nlonger thought of Sellanraa divided between his two sons when he\r\nhimself should be gone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome way on in spring came engineers and workmen from Sweden; going\r\nto build roads, put up hutments, work in various ways, blasting,\r\nlevelling, getting up supplies of food, hiring teams of horses, making\r\narrangements with owners of land by the waterside; what--what was it\r\nall about? This is in the wilds, where folk never came but those who\r\nlived there? Well, they were going to start that copper mine, that was\r\nall.\r\n\r\nSo it had come to something after all; Geissler had not been merely\r\nboasting.\r\n\r\nIt was not the same big men that had come with him that time--no, the\r\ntwo of them had stayed behind, having business elsewhere, no doubt.\r\nBut the same engineer was there, and the mining expert that had come\r\nat first. They bought up all the sawn planks Isak could spare, bought\r\nfood and drink and paid for it well, chatted in kindly fashion and\r\nwere pleased with Sellanraa. "Aerial railway," they said. "Cable\r\nhaulage from the top of the fjeld down to the waterside," they said.\r\n\r\n"What, down over all this moorland here?" said Isak, being slow to\r\nthink. But they laughed at that.\r\n\r\n"No, on the other side, man; not this way, \'twould be miles to go. No,\r\non the other side of the fjeld, straight down to the sea; a good fall,\r\nand no distance to speak of. Run the ore down through the air in iron\r\ntanks; oh, it\'ll work all right, you wait and see. But we\'ll have to\r\ncart it down at first; make a road, and have it hauled down in carts.\r\nWe shall want fifty horses--you see, we\'ll get on finely. And we\'ve\r\nmore men on the works than these few here--that\'s nothing. There\'s\r\nmore coming up from the other side, gangs of men, with huts all\r\nready to put up, and stores of provisions and material and tools and\r\nthings--then we meet and make connection with them half-way, on the\r\ntop, you see? We\'ll make the thing go, never fear--and ship the ore to\r\nSouth America. There\'s millions to be made out of it."\r\n\r\n"What about the other gentlemen," asked Isak, "that came up here\r\nbefore?"\r\n\r\n"What? Oh, they\'ve sold out. So you remember them? No, they\'ve sold.\r\nAnd the people that bought them out have sold again. It\'s a big\r\ncompany now that owns the mine--any amount of money behind it."\r\n\r\n"And Geissler, where\'ll he be now?" asks Isak.\r\n\r\n"Geissler? Never heard of him. Who\'s he?"\r\n\r\n"Lensmand Geissler, that sold you the place first of all."\r\n\r\n"Oh, him! Geissler was his name? Heaven knows where he is now. So you\r\nremember him too?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBlasting and working up in the hills, gangs of men at work all through\r\nthe summer--there was plenty doing about the place. Inger did a\r\nbusy trade in milk and farm produce, and it amused her--going into\r\nbusiness, as it were, and seeing all the many folk coming and going.\r\nIsak tramped about with his lumbering tread, and worked on his land;\r\nnothing disturbed him. Sivert and the two stoneworkers got the new\r\ncowshed up. It was a fine building, but took a deal of time before it\r\nwas finished, with only three men to the work, and Sivert, moreover,\r\noften called away to help in the fields. The mowing-machine was useful\r\nnow; and a good thing, too, to have three active women that could take\r\na turn at the haymaking.\r\n\r\nAll going well; there was life in the wilds now, and money growing,\r\nblossoming everywhere.\r\n\r\nAnd look at Storborg, the new trader\'s place--there was a business on\r\na proper scale! This Aron must be a wizard, a devil of a fellow; he\r\nhad learned somehow beforehand of the mining operations to come, and\r\nwas on the spot all ready, with his shop and store, to make the most\r\nof it. Business? He did business enough for a whole State--ay, enough\r\nfor a king! To begin with, he sold all kinds of household utensils and\r\nworkmen\'s clothes; but miners earning good money are not afraid to\r\nspend it; not content with buying necessaries only; they would buy\r\nanything and everything. And most of all on Saturday evenings, the\r\ntrading station at Storborg was crowded with folk, and Aron raking\r\nmoney in; his clerk and his wife were both called in to help behind\r\nthe counter, and Aron himself serving and selling as hard as he could\r\ngo at it--and even then the place would not be empty till late at\r\nnight. And the owners of horse-flesh in the village, they were right;\r\n\'twas a mighty carting and hauling of wares up to Storborg; more than\r\nonce they had to cut off corners of the old road and make new short\r\ncuts--a fine new road it was at last, very different from Isak\'s\r\nfirst narrow path up through the wilds. Aron was a blessing and a\r\nbenefactor, nothing less, with his store and his new road. His name\r\nwas not Aron really, that being only his Christian name; properly, he\r\nwas Aronsen, and so he called himself, and his wife called him the\r\nsame. They were a family not to be looked down upon, and kept two\r\nservant-girls and a lad.\r\n\r\nAs for the land at Storborg, it remained untouched for the present.\r\nAronsen had no time for working on the soil--where was the sense of\r\ndigging up a barren moor? But Aronsen had a garden, with a fence all\r\nround, and currant bushes and asters and rowans and planted trees--ay,\r\na real garden. There was a broad path down it, where Aronsen could\r\nwalk o\' Sundays and smoke his pipe, and in the background was the\r\nverandah of the house, with panes of coloured glass, orange and red\r\nand blue. Storborg ... And there were children--three pretty little\r\nthings about the place. The girl was to learn to play her part as\r\ndaughter of a wealthy trader, and the boys were to learn the business\r\nthemselves--ay, three children with a future before them!\r\n\r\nAronsen was a man to take thought for the future, or he would not have\r\ncome there at all. He might have stuck to his fishery, and like enough\r\nbeen lucky at that and made good money, but \'twas not like going into\r\nbusiness; nothing so fine, a thing for common folk at best. People\r\ndidn\'t take off their hats to a fisherman. Aronsen had rowed his boat\r\nbefore, pulling at the oars; now he was going to sail instead. There\r\nwas a word he was always using: "Cash down." He used it all sorts of\r\nways. When things went well, they were going "cash down." His children\r\nwere to get on in the world, and live more "cash down" even than\r\nhimself. That was how he put it, meaning that they should have an\r\neasier life of it than he had had.\r\n\r\nAnd look you, things did go well; neighbours took notice of him, and\r\nof his wife--ay, even of the children. It was not the least remarkable\r\nthing, that folk took notice of the children. The miners came down\r\nfrom their work in the hills, and had not seen a child\'s face for many\r\ndays; when they caught sight of Aronsen\'s little ones playing in the\r\nyard, they would talk kindly to them at once, as if they had met three\r\npuppies at play. They would have given them money, but seeing they\r\nwere the trader\'s children, it would hardly do. So they played music\r\nfor them on their mouth-organs instead. Young Gustaf came down, the\r\nwildest of them all, with his hat over one ear, and his lips ever\r\nready with a merry word; ay, Gustaf it was that came and played with\r\nthem for long at a time. The children knew him every time, and ran to\r\nmeet them; he would pick them up and carry them on his back, all three\r\nof them, and dance with them. "Ho!" said Gustaf, and danced with them.\r\nAnd then he would take out his mouth-organ and play tunes and music\r\nfor them, till the two servant-girls would come out and look at him,\r\nand listen, with tears in their eyes. Ay, a madcap was Gustaf, but he\r\nknew what he was doing!\r\n\r\nThen after a bit he would go into the shop and throw his money about,\r\nbuying up a whole knapsack full of things. And when he went back up\r\nthe road again, it was with a whole little stock-in-trade of his\r\nown--and he would stop at Sellanraa on the way and open his pack and\r\nshow them. Notepaper with a flower in the corner, and a new pipe and\r\na new shirt, and a fringed neckerchief--sweets for the womenfolk, and\r\nshiny things, a watch-chain with a compass, a pocket-knife--oh, a host\r\nof things. Ay, there were rockets he had bought to let off on\r\nSunday, for every one to see. Inger gave him milk, and he joked with\r\nLeopoldine, and picked up little Rebecca and swung her up in the\r\nair--"_Hoy huit_!"\r\n\r\n"And how\'s the building getting on?" he asked the Swedes--Gustaf was\r\na Swede himself, and made friends with them too. The building was\r\ngetting on as best it could, with but themselves to the work. Why,\r\nthen, he\'d come and give them a hand himself, would Gustaf, though\r\nthat was only said in jest.\r\n\r\n"Ay, if you only would," said Inger. For the cowshed ought to be ready\r\nby the autumn, when the cattle were brought in.\r\n\r\nGustaf let off a rocket, and having let off one, there was no sense\r\nin keeping the rest. As well let them off too--and so he did, half a\r\ndozen of them, and the women and children stood round breathless at\r\nthe magic of the magician; and Inger had never seen a rocket before,\r\nbut the wild fire of them somehow reminded her of the great world she\r\nhad once seen. What was a sewing-machine to this? And when Gustaf\r\nfinished up by playing his mouth-organ, Inger would have gone off\r\nalong the road with him for sheer emotion....\r\n\r\nThe mine is working now, and the ore is carted down by teams of horses\r\nto the sea; a steamer had loaded up one cargo and sailed away with it\r\nto South America, and another steamer waits already for the next load.\r\nAy, \'tis a big concern. All the settlers have been up to look at the\r\nwonderful place, as many as can walk. Brede Olsen has been up, with\r\nhis samples of stone, and got nothing for his pains, seeing that the\r\nmining expert was gone back to Sweden again. On Sundays, there was a\r\ncrowd of people coming up all the way from the village; ay, even Axel\r\nStroem, who had no time to throw away, turned off from his proper road\r\nalong the telegraph line to look at the place. Hardly a soul now but\r\nhas seen the mine and its wonders. And at last Inger herself, Inger\r\nfrom Sellanraa, puts on her best, gold ring and all, and goes up to\r\nthe hills. What does she want there?\r\n\r\nNothing, does not even care to see how the work is done. Inger has\r\ncome to show herself, that is all. When she saw the other women going\r\nup, she felt she must go too. A disfiguring scar on her upper lip, and\r\ngrown children of her own, has Inger, but she must go as the others\r\ndid. It irks her to think of the others, young women, ay ... but she\r\nwill try if she can\'t compete with them all the same. She has not\r\nbegun to grow stout as yet, but has still a good figure enough, tall\r\nand natty enough; she can still look well. True, her colouring is\r\nnot what it used to be, and her skin is not comparable to a golden\r\npeach--but they should see for all that; ay, they should say, after\r\nall, she was good enough!\r\n\r\nThey greet her kindly as she could wish; the workmen know her, she has\r\ngiven them many a drink of milk, and they show her over the mine, the\r\nhuts, the stables and kitchens, the cellars and storesheds; the bolder\r\nmen edge in close to her and take her lightly by the arm, but Inger\r\ndoes not feel hurt at all, it does her good. And where there are\r\nsteps to go up or down, she lifts her skirts high, showing her legs a\r\ntrifle; but she manages it quietly, as if without a thought. Ay, she\'s\r\ngood enough, think the men to themselves.\r\n\r\nOh, but there is something touching about her, this woman getting on\r\nin years; plain to see that a glance from one of these warm-blooded\r\nmenfolk came all unexpectedly to her; she was grateful for it, and\r\nreturned it; she was a woman like other women, and it thrilled her to\r\nfeel so. An honest woman she had been, but like enough \'twas for lack\r\nof opportunity.\r\n\r\nGetting on in years....\r\n\r\nGustaf came up. Left two girls from the village, and a comrade, just\r\nto come. Gustaf knew what he was at, no doubt; he took Inger\'s hand\r\nwith more warmth, more pressure than was needed, and thanked her for\r\nthe last pleasant evening at Sellanraa, but he was careful not to\r\nplague her with attention.\r\n\r\n"Well, Gustaf, and when are you coming to help us with the building?"\r\nsays Inger, going red. And Gustaf says he will come sure enough before\r\nlong. His comrades hear it, and put in a word that they\'ll all be\r\ncoming down before long.\r\n\r\n"Ho!" says Inger. "Aren\'t you going to stay on the mine, then, come\r\nwinter?"\r\n\r\nThe men answer cautiously, that it doesn\'t look like it, but can\'t be\r\nsure. But Gustaf is bolder, and laughs and says, looks like they\'ve\r\nscraped out the bit of copper there was.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll not say that in earnest surely?" says Inger. And the other men\r\nput in that Gustaf had better be careful not to say any such thing.\r\n\r\nBut Gustaf was not going to be careful; he said a great deal more, and\r\nas for Inger, \'twas strange how he managed to win her for himself, for\r\nall that he never seemed to put himself forward that way. One of\r\nthe other lads played a concertina, but \'twas not like Gustaf\'s\r\nmouth-organ; another lad again, and a smart fellow he was too, tried\r\nto draw attention to himself by singing a song off by heart to the\r\nmusic, but that was nothing either, for all that he had a fine rolling\r\nvoice. And a little while after, there was Gustaf, and if he hadn\'t\r\ngot Inger\'s gold ring on his little finger! And how had it come about,\r\nwhen he never plagued nor pushed himself forward? Oh, he was forward\r\nenough in his way, but quiet with it all, as Inger herself; they did\r\nnot talk of things, and she let him play with her hand as if without\r\nnoticing. Later on, when she sat in one of the huts drinking coffee,\r\nthere was a noise outside, high words between the men, and she knew it\r\nwas about herself, and it warmed her. A pleasant thing to hear, for\r\none no longer young, for a woman getting on in years.\r\n\r\nAnd how did she come home from the hills that Sunday evening? Ho, well\r\nenough, virtuous as she had come, no more and no less. There was a\r\ncrowd of men to see her home, the crowd of them that would not turn\r\nback as long as Gustaf was there; would not leave her alone with him,\r\nnot if they knew it! Inger had never had such a gay time, not even in\r\nthe days when she had been out in the world.\r\n\r\n"Hadn\'t Inger lost something?" they asked at last.\r\n\r\n"Lost something? No."\r\n\r\n"A gold ring, for instance?"\r\n\r\nAnd at that Gustaf had to bring it out; he was one against all, a\r\nwhole army.\r\n\r\n"Oh, \'twas a good thing you found it," said Inger, and made haste to\r\nsay good-bye to her escort. She drew nearer Sellanraa, saw the many\r\nroofs of the buildings; it was her home that lay there. And she awoke\r\nonce more, came back to herself, like the clever wife she was, and\r\ntook a short cut through to the summer shed to look to the cattle. On\r\nthe way she passes by a place she knows; a little child had once lain\r\nburied there; she had patted down the earth with her hands, set up a\r\ntiny cross--oh, but it was long ago. Now, she was wondering if those\r\ngirls had finished their milking in good time....\r\n\r\nThe work at the mine goes on, but there are whisperings of something\r\nwrong, the yield is not as good as it had promised. The mining expert,\r\nwho had gone back home, came out again with another expert to help\r\nhim; they went about blasting and boring and examining all the ground.\r\nWhat was wrong? The copper is fine enough, nothing wrong with that,\r\nbut thin, and no real depth in it; getting thicker to the southward,\r\nlying deep and fine just where the company\'s holding reached its\r\nlimit--and beyond that was _Almenning_, the property of the State.\r\nWell, the first purchasers had perhaps not thought so much of the\r\nthing, anyway. It was a family affair, some relatives who had bought\r\nthe place as a speculation; they had not troubled to secure the whole\r\nrange, all the miles to the next valley, no; they had but taken over\r\na patch of ground from Isak Sellanraa and Geissler, and then sold it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAnd what was to be done now? The leading men, with the experts and the\r\nforemen, know well enough; they must start negotiations with the State\r\nat once. So they send a messenger off at full speed to Sweden, with\r\nletters and plans and charts, and ride away themselves down to the\r\nLensmand below, to get the rights of the fjeld south of the water. And\r\nhere their difficulties begin; the law stands in their way; they are\r\nforeigners, and cannot be purchasers in their own right. They knew all\r\nabout that, and had made arrangements. But the southern side of the\r\nfjeld was sold already--and that they did not know. "Sold?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, long ago, years back."\r\n\r\n"Who bought it then?"\r\n\r\n"Geissler."\r\n\r\n"What Geissler?--oh, that fellow--h\'m."\r\n\r\n"And the title-deeds approved and registered," says the Lensmand.\r\n"\'Twas bare rock, no more, and he got it for next to nothing."\r\n\r\n"Who is this fellow Geissler that keeps cropping up? Where is he?"\r\n\r\n"Heaven knows where he is now!"\r\n\r\nAnd a new messenger is sent off to Sweden. They must find out all\r\nabout this Geissler. Meanwhile, they could not keep on all the men;\r\nthey must wait and see.\r\n\r\nSo Gustaf came down to Sellanraa, with all his worldly goods on his\r\nback, and here he was, he said. Ay, Gustaf had given up his work at\r\nthe mine--that is to say, he had been a trifle too outspoken the\r\nSunday before, about the mine and the copper in the mine; the foreman\r\nhad heard of it, and the engineer, and Gustaf was given his discharge.\r\nWell, good-bye then, and maybe \'twas the very thing he wanted; there\r\ncould be nothing suspicious now about his coming to Sellanraa. They\r\nset him to work at once on the cowshed.\r\n\r\nThey worked and worked at the stone walls, and when a few days later\r\nanother man came down from the mine, he was taken on too; now there\r\nwere two spells, and the work went apace. Ay, they would have it ready\r\nby the autumn, never fear.\r\n\r\nBut now one after another of the miners came down, dismissed, and took\r\nthe road to Sweden; the trial working was stopped for the present.\r\nThere was something like a sigh from the folk in the village at the\r\nnews; foolish folk, they did not understand what a trial working was,\r\nthat it was only working on trial, but so it was. There were dark\r\nforebodings and discouragement among the village folk; money was\r\nscarcer, wages were reduced, things were very quiet at the trading\r\nstation at Storborg. What did it all mean? Just when everything was\r\ngoing on finely, and Aronsen had got a flagstaff and a flag, and had\r\nbought a fine white bearskin for a rug to have in the sledge for the\r\nwinter, and fine clothes for all the family ... Little matters these,\r\nbut there were greater things happening as well. Here were two new\r\nmen had bought up land for clearing in the wilds; high up between\r\nMaaneland and Sellanraa, and that was no small event for the whole of\r\nthat little outlying community. The two new settlers had built\r\ntheir turf huts and started clearing ground and digging. They were\r\nhard-working folk, and had done much in a little time. All that summer\r\nthey had bought their provisions at Storborg, but when they came\r\ndown now, last time, there was hardly anything to be had. Nothing in\r\nstock--and what did Aron want with heavy stocks of this and that now\r\nthe work at the mine had stopped? He had hardly anything of any sort\r\non the place now--only money. Of all the folk in the neighbourhood,\r\nAronsen was perhaps the most dejected; his reckoning was all upset.\r\nWhen some one urged him to cultivate his land and live on that till\r\nbetter times, he answered: "Cultivate the land? \'Twas not that I came\r\nand set up house here for."\r\n\r\nAt last Aronsen could stand it no longer; he must go up to the mine\r\nand see for himself how things were. It was a Sunday. When he got to\r\nSellanraa, he wanted Isak to go with him, but Isak had never yet set\r\nfoot on the mine since they had started; he was more at home on the\r\nhillside below. Inger had to put in a word. "You might as well go with\r\nAronsen, when he asks you," she said. And maybe Inger was not sorry to\r\nhave him go; \'twas Sunday, and like as not she wanted to be rid of him\r\nfor an hour or so. And so Isak went along.\r\n\r\nThere were strange things to be seen up there in the hills; Isak did\r\nnot recognize the place at all now, with its huts and sheds, a whole\r\ntown of them, and carts and waggons and great gaping holes in the\r\nground. The engineer himself showed them round. Maybe he was not in\r\nthe best of humour just now, that same engineer, but he had tried\r\nall along to keep away the feeling of gloom that had fallen upon the\r\nvillage folk and the settlers round--and here was his chance, with no\r\nless persons than the Margrave of Sellanraa and the great trader from\r\nStorborg on the spot.\r\n\r\nHe explained the nature of the ore and the rocks in which it was\r\nfound. Copper, iron, and sulphur, all were there together. Ay, they\r\nknew exactly what there was in the rocks up there--even gold and\r\nsilver was there, though not so much of it. A mining engineer, he\r\nknows a deal of things.\r\n\r\n"And it\'s all going to shut down now?" asked Aronsen.\r\n\r\n"Shut down?" repeated the engineer in astonishment. "A nice thing\r\nthat\'d be for South America if we did!" No, they were discontinuing\r\ntheir preliminary operations for a while, only for a short time; they\r\nhad seen what the place was like, what it could produce; then they\r\ncould build their aerial railway and get to work on the southern side\r\nof the fjeld. He turned to Isak: "You don\'t happen to know where this\r\nGeissler\'s got to?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\nWell, no matter--they\'d get hold of him all right. And then they\'d\r\nstart to work again. Shut down? The idea!\r\n\r\nIsak is suddenly lost in wonder and delight over a little machine\r\nthat works with a treadle--simply move your foot and it works. He\r\nunderstands it at once--\'tis a little smithy to carry about on a cart\r\nand take down and set up anywhere you please.\r\n\r\n"What\'s a thing like that cost, now?" he asks.\r\n\r\n"That? Portable forge? Oh, nothing much." They had several of the same\r\nsort, it appeared, but nothing to what they had down at the sea; all\r\nsorts of machines and apparatus, huge big things. Isak was given to\r\nunderstand that mining, the making of valleys and enormous chasms\r\nin the rock, was not a business that could be done with your\r\nfingernails--ha ha!\r\n\r\nThey stroll about the place, and the engineer mentions that he himself\r\nwill be going across to Sweden in a few days\' time.\r\n\r\n"But you\'ll be coming back again?" says Aronsen.\r\n\r\nWhy, of course. Knew of no reason why the Government or the police\r\nshould try to keep him.\r\n\r\nIsak managed to lead round to the portable forge once more and\r\nstopped, looking at it again. "And what might a bit of a machine like\r\nthat cost?" he asked.\r\n\r\nCost? Couldn\'t say off-hand--a deal of money, no doubt, but nothing to\r\nspeak of in mining operations. Oh, a grand fellow was the engineer;\r\nnot in the best of humour himself just then, perhaps, but he kept up\r\nappearances and played up rich and fine to the last. Did Isak want a\r\nforge? Well, he might take that one--the company would never trouble\r\nabout a little thing like that--the company would make him a present\r\nof a portable forge!\r\n\r\nAn hour after, Aronsen and Isak were on their way down again. Aronsen\r\nsomething calmer in mind--there was hope after all. Isak trundles down\r\nthe hillside with his precious forge on his back. Ay, a barge of a\r\nman, he could bear a load! The engineer had offered to send a couple\r\nof men down with it to Sellanraa next morning, but Isak thanked\r\nhim--\'twas more than worth his while. He was thinking of his own folk;\r\n\'twould be a fine surprise for them to see him come walking down with\r\na smithy on his back.\r\n\r\nBut \'twas Isak was surprised after all.\r\n\r\nA horse and cart turned into the courtyard just as he reached home.\r\nAnd a highly remarkable load it brought. The driver was a man from\r\nthe village, but beside him walked a gentleman at whom Isak stared in\r\nastonishment--it was Geissler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were other things that might have given Isak matter for\r\nsurprise, but he was no great hand at thinking of more than one thing\r\nat a time. "Where\'s Inger?" was all he said as he passed by the\r\nkitchen door. He was only anxious to see that Geissler was well\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nInger? Inger was out plucking berries; had been out plucking berries\r\never since Isak started--she and Gustaf the Swede. Ay, getting on in\r\nyears, and all in love again and wild with it; autumn and winter near,\r\nbut she felt the warmth in herself again, flowers and blossoming\r\nagain. "Come and show where there\'s cloudberries," said Gustaf;\r\n"cranberries," said he. And how could a woman say no? Inger ran\r\ninto her little room and was both earnest and religious for several\r\nminutes; but there was Gustaf standing waiting outside, the world was\r\nat her heels, and all she did was to tidy her hair, look at herself\r\ncarefully in the glass, and out again. And what if she did? Who would\r\nnot have done the same? Oh, a woman cannot tell one man from another;\r\nnot always--not often.\r\n\r\nAnd they two go out plucking berries, plucking cloudberries on the\r\nmoorland, stepping from tuft to tuft, and she lifts her skirts high,\r\nand has her neat legs to show. All quiet everywhere; the white grouse\r\nhave their young ones grown already and do not fly up hissing any\r\nmore; they are sheltered spots where bushes grow on the moors. Less\r\nthan an hour since they started, and already they are sitting down to\r\nrest. Says Inger: "Oh, I didn\'t think you were like that?" Oh, she\r\nis all weakness towards him, and smiles piteously, being so deep in\r\nlove--ay, a sweet and cruel thing to be in love, \'tis both! Right and\r\nproper to be on her guard--ay, but only to give in at last. Inger\r\nis so deep in love--desperately, mercilessly; her heart is full of\r\nkindliness towards him, she only cares to be close and precious to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAy, a woman getting on in years....\r\n\r\n"When the work\'s finished, you\'ll be going off again," says she.\r\n\r\nNo, he wasn\'t going. Well, of course, some time, but not yet, not for\r\na week or so.\r\n\r\n"Hadn\'t we better be getting home?" says she.\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\nThey pluck more berries, and in a little while they find a sheltered\r\nplace among the bushes, and Inger says: "Gustaf, you\'re mad to do it."\r\nAnd hours pass--they\'ll be sleeping now, belike, among the bushes.\r\nSleeping? Wonderful--far out in the wilderness, in the Garden of Eden.\r\nThen suddenly Inger sits upright and listens: "Seems like I heard some\r\none down on the road away off?"\r\n\r\nThe sun is setting, the tufts of heather darkening in shadow as they\r\nwalk home. They pass by many sheltered spots, and Gustaf sees them,\r\nand Inger, she sees them too no doubt, but all the time she feels as\r\nif some one were driving ahead of them. Oh, but who could walk all the\r\nway home with a wild handsome lad, and be on her guard all the time?\r\nInger is too weak, she can only smile and say: "I never knew such a\r\none."\r\n\r\nShe comes home alone. And well that she came just then, a fortunate\r\nthing. A minute later had not been well at all. Isak had just come\r\ninto the courtyard with his forge, and Aronsen--and there is a horse\r\nand cart just pulled up.\r\n\r\n"_Goddag_," says Geissler, greeting Inger as well. And there they\r\nstand, all looking one at another--couldn\'t be better....\r\n\r\nGeissler back again. Years now since he was there, but he is back\r\nagain, aged a little, greyer a little, but bright and cheerful as\r\never. And finely dressed this time, with a white waistcoat and gold\r\nchain across. A man beyond understanding!\r\n\r\nHad he an inkling, maybe, that something was going on up at the mine,\r\nand wanted to see for himself? Well, here he was. Very wide awake to\r\nlook at, glancing round at the place, at the land, turning his head\r\nand using his eyes every way. There are great changes to note; the\r\nMargrave had extended his domains. And Geissler nods.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that you\'re carrying?" he asks Isak. "\'Tis a load for one\r\nhorse in itself," says he.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis for a forge," explains Isak. "And a mighty useful thing to have\r\non a bit of a farm," says he--ay, calling Sellanraa a bit of a farm,\r\nno more!\r\n\r\n"Where did you get hold of it?"\r\n\r\n"Up at the mine. Engineer, he gave me the thing for a present, he\r\nsaid."\r\n\r\n"The company\'s engineer?" says Geissler, as if he had not understood.\r\n\r\nAnd Geissler, was he to be outdone by an engineer on a copper mine?\r\n"I\'ve heard you\'d got a mowing-machine," says he, "and I\'ve brought\r\nalong a patent raker thing that\'s handy to have." And he points to the\r\nload on the cart. There it stood, red and blue, a huge comb, a hayrake\r\nto be driven with horses. They lifted it out of the cart and looked at\r\nit; Isak harnessed himself to the thing and tried it over the ground.\r\nNo wonder his mouth opened wide! Marvel on marvel coming to Sellanraa!\r\n\r\nThey spoke of the mine, of the work up in the hills. "They were asking\r\nabout you, quite a lot," said Isak.\r\n\r\n"Who?"\r\n\r\n"The engineer, and all the other gentlemen. \'Have to get hold of you\r\nsomehow,\' they said."\r\n\r\nOh, but here Isak was saying overmuch, it seemed. Geissler was\r\noffended, no doubt; he turned sharp and curt, and said: "Well, I\'m\r\nhere, if they want me."\r\n\r\nNext day came the two messengers back from Sweden, and with them a\r\ncouple of the mine-owners; on horseback they were, fine gentlemen and\r\nportly; mighty rich folk, by the look of them. They hardly stopped\r\nat Sellanraa at all, simply asked a question or so about the road,\r\nwithout dismounting, and rode on up the hill. Geissler they pretended\r\nnot to see, though he stood quite close. The messengers with their\r\nloaded packhorses rested for an hour, talked to the men at work on the\r\nbuilding, learned that the old gentleman in the white waistcoat and\r\ngold chain was Geissler, and then they too went on again. But that\r\nsame evening one of them came riding down to the place with a message\r\nby word of mouth for Geissler to come up to the gentlemen at the\r\nmines. "I\'m here if they want me," was the answer Geissler sent back.\r\n\r\nGeissler was grown an important personage, it seemed; thought himself\r\na man of power, of all the power in the world; considered it, perhaps,\r\nbeneath his dignity to be sent for by word of mouth. But how was it he\r\nhad come to Sellanraa at all just then--just when he was most wanted?\r\nA great one he must be for knowing things, all manner of things.\r\nAnyway, when the gentlemen up at the mine had Geissler\'s answer, there\r\nwas nothing for it but they must bestir themselves and come all the\r\nway down to Sellanraa again. The engineer and the two mining experts\r\ncame with them.\r\n\r\nSo many crooked ways and turnings were there before that meeting\r\nwas brought about. It looked ill to start with; ay, Geissler was\r\nover-lordly by far.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen were polite enough this time; begged him to excuse their\r\nhaving sent a verbal message the day before, being tired out after\r\ntheir journey. Geissler was polite in return, and said he too was\r\ntired out after his journey, or he would have come. Well, and then, to\r\nget to business; Would Geissler sell the land south of the water?\r\n\r\n"Do you wish to purchase on your own account, may I ask," said\r\nGeissler, "or are you acting as agents?"\r\n\r\nNow this could be nothing but sheer contrariness on Geissler\'s part;\r\nhe could surely see for himself that rich and portly gentlemen of\r\ntheir stamp would not be acting as agents. They went on to discuss\r\nterms. "What about the price?" said they.\r\n\r\n"The price?--yes," said Geissler, and sat thinking it over. "A couple\r\nof million," said he.\r\n\r\n"Indeed?" said the gentlemen, and smiled. But Geissler did not smile.\r\n\r\nThe engineer and the two experts had made a rough investigation of the\r\nground, made a few borings and blastings, and here was their report:\r\nthe occurrence of ore was due to eruption; it was irregular, and\r\nfrom their preliminary examination appeared to be deepest in the\r\nneighbourhood of the boundary between the company\'s land and\r\nGeissler\'s decreasing from there onwards. For the last mile or so\r\nthere was no ore to be found worth working.\r\n\r\nGeissler listened to all this with the greatest nonchalance. He took\r\nsome papers from his pocket, and looked at them carefully; but the\r\npapers were not charts nor maps--like as not they were things no way\r\nconnected with the mine at all.\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t gone deep enough," said he, as if it were something he\r\nhad read in his papers. The gentlemen admitted that at once, but\r\nthe engineer asked: How did he know that--"You haven\'t made borings\r\nyourself, I suppose?"\r\n\r\nAnd Geissler smiled, as if he had bored hundreds of miles down through\r\nthe globe, and covered up the holes again after.\r\n\r\nThey kept at it till noon, talking it over this way and that, and at\r\nlast began to look at their watches. They had brought Geissler down to\r\nhalf a million now, but not a hair\'s breadth farther. No; they must\r\nhave put him out sorely some way or other. They seemed to think he was\r\nanxious to sell, obliged to sell, but he was not--ho, not a bit; there\r\nhe sat, as easy and careless as themselves, and no mistaking it.\r\n\r\n"Fifteen, say twenty thousand would be a decent price anyway," said\r\nthey.\r\n\r\nGeissler agreed that might be a decent price enough for any one sorely\r\nin need of the money, but five-and-twenty thousand would be better.\r\nAnd then one of the gentlemen put in--saying it perhaps by way of\r\nkeeping Geissler from soaring too far: "By the way, I\'ve seen your\r\nwife\'s people in Sweden--they sent their kind regards."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said Geissler.\r\n\r\n"Well," said the other gentleman, seeing Geissler was not to be won\r\nover that way, "a quarter of a million ... it\'s not gold we\'re buying,\r\nbut copper ore."\r\n\r\n"Exactly," said Geissler. "It\'s copper ore."\r\n\r\nAnd at that they lost patience, all of them, and five watch-cases were\r\nopened and snapped to again; no more time to fool away now; it was\r\ntime for dinner. They did not ask for food at Sellanraa, but rode back\r\nto the mine to get their own.\r\n\r\nAnd that was the end of the meeting.\r\n\r\nGeissler was left alone.\r\n\r\nWhat would be in his mind all this time--what was he pondering and\r\nspeculating about? Nothing at all, maybe, but only idle and careless?\r\nNo, indeed, he was thinking of something, but calm enough for all\r\nthat. After dinner, he turned to Isak, and said: "I\'m going for a long\r\nwalk over my land up there; and I\'d have liked to have Sivert with me,\r\nsame as last time."\r\n\r\n"Ay, so you shall," said Isak at once.\r\n\r\n"No; he\'s other things to do, just now."\r\n\r\n"He shall go with you at once," said Isak, and called to Sivert to\r\nleave his work. But Geissler held up his hand, and said shortly: "No."\r\n\r\nHe walked round the yard several times, came back and talked to the\r\nmen at their work, chatting easily with them and going off and coming\r\nback again. And all the time with this weighty matter on his mind, yet\r\ntalking as if it were nothing at all. Geissler had long been so long\r\naccustomed to changes of fortune, maybe he was past feeling there was\r\nanything at stake now, whatever might be in the air.\r\n\r\nHere he was, the man he was, by the merest chance. He had sold the\r\nfirst little patch of land to his wife\'s relations, and what then?\r\nGone off and bought up the whole tract south of the water--what for?\r\nWas it to annoy them by making himself their neighbour? At first, no\r\ndoubt, he had only thought of taking over a little strip of the land\r\nthere, just where the new village would have to be built if the\r\nworkings came to anything, but in the end he had come to be owner of\r\nthe whole fjeld. The land was to be had for next to nothing, and he\r\ndid not want a lot of trouble with boundaries. So, from sheer idleness\r\nhe had become a mining king, a lord of the mountains; he had thought\r\nof a site for huts and machine sheds, and it had become a kingdom,\r\nstretching right down to the sea.\r\n\r\nIn Sweden, the first little patch of land had passed from hand to\r\nhand, and Geissler had taken care to keep himself informed as to its\r\nfate. The first purchasers, of course, had bought foolishly, bought\r\nwithout sense or forethought; the family council were not mining\r\nexperts, they had not secured enough land at first, thinking only of\r\nbuying out a certain Geissler, and getting rid of him. But the new\r\nowners were no less to be laughed at; mighty men, no doubt, who could\r\nafford to indulge in a jest, and take up land for amusement\'s sake,\r\nfor a drunken wager, or Heaven knows what. But when it came to trial\r\nworkings, and exploiting the land in earnest, then suddenly they found\r\nthemselves butting up against a wall--Geissler.\r\n\r\nChildren! thought Geissler, maybe, in his lofty mind; he felt his\r\npower now, felt strong enough to be short and abrupt with folk. The\r\nothers had certainly done their best to take him down a peg; they\r\nimagined they were dealing with a man in need of money, and threw out\r\nhints of some fifteen or twenty thousand--ay, children. They did not\r\nknow Geissler. And now here he stood.\r\n\r\nThey came down no more that day from the fjeld, thinking best, no\r\ndoubt, not to show themselves over-anxious. Next morning they came\r\ndown, packhorses and all, on their way home. And lo--Geissler was not\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nNot there?\r\n\r\nThat put an end to any ideas they might have had of settling the\r\nmanner in lordly wise, from the saddle; they had to dismount and wait.\r\nAnd where was Geissler, if you please? Nobody could tell them; he went\r\nabout everywhere, did Geissler, took an interest in Sellanraa and all\r\nabout it; the last they had seen of him was up at the sawmill. The\r\nmessengers were sent out to look for him, but Geissler must have gone\r\nsome distance, it seemed, for he gave no answer when they shouted. The\r\ngentlemen looked at their watches, and were plainly annoyed at first,\r\nand said: "We\'re not going to fool about here waiting like this. If\r\nGeissler wants to sell, he must be on the spot." Oh, but they changed\r\ntheir tone in a little while; showed no annoyance after a while, but\r\neven began to find something amusing in it all, to jest about it. Here\r\nwere they in a desperate case; they would have to lie out there in\r\nthe desolate hills all night. And get lost and starve to death in the\r\nwilds, and leave their bones to bleach undiscovered by their mourning\r\nkin--ay, they made a great jest of it all.\r\n\r\nAt last Geissler came. Had been looking round a bit--just come from\r\nthe cattle enclosure. "Looks as if that\'ll be too small for you soon,"\r\nsaid he to Isak. "How many head have you got up there now altogether?"\r\nAy, he could talk like that, with those fine gentlemen standing there\r\nwatch in hand. Curiously red in the face was Geissler, as if he had\r\nbeen drinking. "Puh!" said he. "I\'m all hot, walking."\r\n\r\n"We half expected you would be here when we came," said one of the\r\ngentlemen.\r\n\r\n"I had no word of your wanting to see me at all," answered Geissler,\r\n"otherwise I might have been here on the spot."\r\n\r\nWell, and what about the business now? Was Geissler prepared to accept\r\na reasonable offer today? It wasn\'t every day he had a chance of\r\nfifteen or twenty thousand--what? Unless, of course.... If the money\r\nwere nothing to him, why, then....\r\n\r\nThis last suggestion was not to Geissler\'s taste at all; he was\r\noffended. A nice way to talk! Well, they would not have said it,\r\nperhaps, if they had not been annoyed at first; and Geissler, no\r\ndoubt, would hardly have turned suddenly pale at their words if he had\r\nnot been out somewhere by himself and got red. As it was, he paled,\r\nand answered coldly:\r\n\r\n"I don\'t wish to make any suggestion as to what you, gentlemen, may be\r\nin a position to pay--but I know what I am willing to accept and what\r\nnot. I\'ve no use for more child\'s prattle about the mine. My price is\r\nthe same as yesterday."\r\n\r\n"A quarter of a million _Kroner_?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen mounted their horses." Look here," said one, "we\'ll go\r\nthis far, and say twenty-five thousand."\r\n\r\n"You\'re still inclined to joke, I see," said Geissler. "But I\'ll make\r\n_you_ an offer in sober earnest: would you care to sell your bit of a\r\nmine up there?"\r\n\r\n"Why," said they, somewhat taken aback--"why, we might do that,\r\nperhaps."\r\n\r\n"I\'m ready to buy it," said Geissler.\r\n\r\nOh, that Geissler! With the courtyard full of people now, listening\r\nto every word; all the Sellanraa folk, and the stoneworkers and the\r\nmessengers. Like as not, he could never have raised the money, nor\r\nanything near it, for such a deal; but, again, who could say? A man\r\nbeyond understanding was Geissler. Anyhow, his last words rather\r\ndisconcerted those gentlemen on horseback. Was it a trick? Did he\r\nreckon to make his own land seem worth more by this manoeuvre?\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen thought it over; ay, they even began to talk softly\r\ntogether about it; they got down from their horses again. Then the\r\nengineer put in a word; he thought, no doubt, it was getting beyond\r\nall bearing. And he seemed to have some power, some kind of authority\r\nhere. And the yard was full of folk all listening to what was going\r\non. "We\'ll not sell," said he.\r\n\r\n"Not?" asked his companions.\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\nThey whispered together again, and they mounted their horses once\r\nmore--in earnest this time. "Twenty-five thousand!" called out one of\r\nthem. Geissler did not answer, but turned away, and went over to talk\r\nto the stoneworkers again.\r\n\r\nAnd that was the end of their last meeting.\r\n\r\nGeissler appeared to care nothing for what might come of it. He walked\r\nabout talking of this, that, and the other; for the moment he seemed\r\nchiefly interested in the laying of some heavy beams across the shell\r\nof the new cowhouse. They were to get the work finished that week,\r\nwith a temporary roof--a new fodder loft was to be built up over later\r\non.\r\n\r\nIsak kept Sivert away from the building work now, and left him\r\nidle--and this he did with a purpose, that Geissler might find the lad\r\nready at any time if he wanted to go exploring with him in the hills.\r\nBut Isak might have saved himself the trouble; Geissler had given up\r\nthe idea, or perhaps forgotten all about it. What he did was to get\r\nInger to pack him up some food, and set off down the road. He stayed\r\naway till evening.\r\n\r\nHe passed the two new clearings that had been started below Sellanraa,\r\nand talked to the men there; went right down to Maaneland to see what\r\nAxel Stroem had got done that year. Nothing very great, it seemed; not\r\nas much as he might have wished, but he had put in some good work on\r\nthe land. Geissler took an interest in this place, too, and asked him:\r\n"Got a horse?"\r\n\r\n"Ay."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ve a mowing-machine and a harrow down south, both new; I\'ll\r\nsend them up, if you like."\r\n\r\n"How?" asked Axel, unable to conceive such magnificence, and thinking\r\nvaguely of payment by instalments.\r\n\r\n"I mean I\'ll make you a present of them," said Geissler.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis hard to believe," said Axel.\r\n\r\n"But you\'ll have to help those two neighbours of yours up above,\r\nbreaking new land."\r\n\r\n"Ay, never fear for that," said Axel; he could still hardly make out\r\nwhat Geissler meant by it all. "So you\'ve machines and things down\r\nsouth?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve a deal of things to look after," said Geissler. Now, as a matter\r\nof fact, Geissler had no great deal of things to look after, but he\r\nliked to make it appear so. As for a mowing-machine and a harrow, he\r\ncould buy them in any of the towns, and send up from there.\r\n\r\nHe stayed talking a long while with Axel Stroem about the other\r\nsettlers near; of Storborg, the trading station; of Axel\'s brother,\r\nnewly married, who had come to Breidablik, and had started draining\r\nthe moors and getting the water out. Axel complained that it was\r\nimpossible to get a woman anywhere to help; he had none but an old\r\ncreature, by name Oline; not much good at the best of times, but he\r\nmight be thankful to have her as long as she stayed. Axel had been\r\nworking day and night part of that summer. He might, perhaps, have got\r\na woman from his own parts, from Helgeland, but that would have meant\r\npaying for her journey, besides wages. A costly business all round.\r\nAxel further told how he had taken over the inspection of the\r\ntelegraph line, but rather wished he had left it alone.\r\n\r\n"That sort of thing\'s only fit for Brede and his like," said Geissler.\r\n\r\n"Ay, that\'s a true word," Axel admitted. "But there was the money to\r\nthink of."\r\n\r\n"How many cows have you got?"\r\n\r\n"Four. And a young bull. \'Twas too far to go up to Sellanraa to\r\ntheirs."\r\n\r\nBut there was a far weightier matter Axel badly wanted to talk over\r\nwith Geissler; Barbro\'s affair had come to light, somehow, and an\r\ninvestigation was in progress. Come to light? Of course it had. Barbro\r\nhad been going about, evidently with child and plain to see, and she\r\nhad left the place by herself all unencumbered and no child at all.\r\nHow had it come about?\r\n\r\nWhen Geissler understood what the matter was, he said quite shortly:\r\n"Come along with me." And he led Axel with him away from the house.\r\nGeissler put on an important air, as one in authority. They sat down\r\nat the edge of the wood, and Geissler said: "Now, then, tell me all\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\nCome to light? Of course it had; how could it be helped? The place was\r\nno longer a desert, with never a soul for miles; and, moreover, Oline\r\nwas there. What had Oline to do with it? Ho! and, to make things\r\nworse, Brede Olsen had made an enemy of her himself. No means of\r\ngetting round Oline now; here she was on the spot, and could worm\r\nthings out of Axel a bit at a time. \'Twas just such underhand work she\r\nlived for; ay, lived by, in some degree. And here was the very thing\r\nfor her--trust Oline for scenting it out! Truth to tell, Oline was\r\ngrown too old now to keep house and tend cattle at Maaneland; she\r\nought to have given it up. But how could she? How could she leave a\r\nplace where a fine, deep mystery lay simply waiting to be brought to\r\nlight? She managed the winter\'s work; ay, she got through the summer,\r\ntoo, and it was a marvel of strength she gained from the mere thought\r\nof being able one day to show up a daughter of Brede himself. The snow\r\nwas not gone from the fields that spring before Oline began poking\r\nabout. She found the little green mound by the stream, and saw at once\r\nthat the turf had been laid down in squares. She had even had the luck\r\nto come upon Axel one day standing by the little grave, and treading\r\nit down. So Axel knew all about it! And Oline nodded her grey\r\nhead--ay, it was her turn now!\r\n\r\nNot but Axel was a kindly man enough to live with, but miserly;\r\ncounted his cheeses, and kept good note of every tuft of wool; Oline\r\ncould not do as she liked with things, not by a long way. And then\r\nthat matter of the accident last year, when she had saved him--if Axel\r\nhad been the right sort, he would have given her the credit for it\r\nall, and acknowledged his debt to her alone. But not a bit of it--Axel\r\nstill held to the division he had made on the spot. Ay, he would say,\r\nif Oline hadn\'t happened to come along, he would have had to lie out\r\nthere in the cold all night; but Brede, he\'d been a good help too, on\r\nthe way home. And that was all the thanks she got! Oline was full of\r\nindignation--surely the Lord Almighty must turn away His face from His\r\ncreatures! How easy it would have been for Axel to lead out a cow from\r\nits stall, and bring it to her and say: "Here\'s a cow for you, Oline."\r\nBut no. Not a word of it.\r\n\r\nWell, let him wait--wait and see if it might not come to cost him more\r\nthan the worth of a cow in the end!\r\n\r\nAll through that summer, Oline kept a look-out for every passer-by,\r\nand whispered to them and nodded and confided things to them in\r\nsecret. "But never a word I\'ve said," so she charged them every time.\r\nOline went down to the village, too, more than once. And now there\r\nwere rumours and talk of things about the place, ay, drifting like a\r\nfog, settling on faces and getting into ears; even the children going\r\nto school at Breidablik began nodding secrets among themselves. And at\r\nlast the Lensmand had to take it up; had to bestir himself and report\r\nit, and ask for instructions. Then he came up with a book to write\r\nin and an assistant to help him; came up to Maaneland one day and\r\ninvestigated things and wrote things down, and went back again. But\r\nthree weeks after, he came up once more, investigating and writing\r\ndown again, and this time, he opened a little green mound by the\r\nstream, and took out the body of a child. Oline was an invaluable help\r\nto him; and in return he had to answer a host of questions she put.\r\nAmong other things, he said yes, it might perhaps come to having Axel\r\narrested too. At that, Oline clasped her hands in dismay at all the\r\nwickedness she had got mixed up with here, and only wished she were\r\nout of the place, far away from it all. "But the girl," she whispered,\r\n"what about Barbro herself?"\r\n\r\n"The girl Barbro," said the Lensmand, "she\'s under arrest now in\r\nBergen. The law must take its course," said he. And he took the little\r\nbody and went back again to the village....\r\n\r\nLittle wonder, then, that Axel Stroem was anxious. He had spoken out to\r\nthe Lensmand and denied nothing; he was in part responsible for the\r\ncoming of the child at all, and in addition, he had dug a grave for\r\nit. And now he was asking Geissler what he had better do next. Would\r\nhe have to go in to the town, to a new and worse examination, and be\r\ntortured there?\r\n\r\nGeissler was not the man he had been--no; and the long story had\r\nwearied him, he seemed duller now, whatever might be the cause. He was\r\nnot the bright and confident soul he had been that morning. He looked\r\nat his watch, got up, and said:\r\n\r\n"This\'ll want thinking over. I\'ll go into it thoroughly and let you\r\nknow before I leave."\r\n\r\nAnd Geissler went off.\r\n\r\nHe came back to Sellanraa that evening, had a little supper, and went\r\nto bed. Slept till late next morning, slept, rested thoroughly; he was\r\ntired, no doubt, after his meeting with the Swedish mine-owners. Not\r\ntill two days after did he make ready to leave. He was his lordly self\r\nagain by then, paid liberally for his keep, and gave little Rebecca a\r\nshining _Krone_.\r\n\r\nHe made a speech to Isak, and said: "It doesn\'t matter in the least if\r\nnothing came of the deal this time, it\'ll come all right later on. For\r\nthe present, I\'m going to stop the working up there and leave it a\r\nbit. As for those fellows--children! Thought they would teach me, did\r\nthey? Did you hear what they offered me? Twenty-five thousand!"\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Isak.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Geissler, and waved his hand as if dismissing all\r\nimpertinent offers of insignificant sums from his mind, "well, it\r\nwon\'t do any harm to the district if I do stop the working there a\r\nbit--on the contrary, it\'ll teach folk to stick to their land. But\r\nthey\'ll feel it in the village. They made a pile of money there last\r\nsummer; fine clothes and fine living for all--but there\'s an end of\r\nthat now. Ay, it might have been worth their while, the good folks\r\ndown there, to have kept in with me; things might have been different\r\nthen. Now, it\'ll be as I please."\r\n\r\nBut for all that, he did not look much of a man to control the fate of\r\nvillages, as he went away. He carried a parcel of food in his hand,\r\nand his white waistcoat was no longer altogether clean. His good wife\r\nmight have equipped him for the journey up this time out of the rest\r\nof the forty thousand she had once got--who could say, perhaps she\r\nhad. Anyhow, he was going back poor enough.\r\n\r\nHe did not forget to look in at Axel Stroem on the way down, and give\r\nthe results of his thinking over. "I\'ve been looking at it every way,"\r\nsaid he. "The matter\'s in abeyance for the present, so there\'s nothing\r\nto be done just yet. You\'ll be called up for a further examination,\r\nand you\'ll have to say how things are...."\r\n\r\nWords, nothing more. Geissler had probably never given the matter a\r\nthought at all. And Axel agreed dejectedly to all he said. But at last\r\nGeissler flickered up into a mighty man again, puckered his brows, and\r\nsaid thoughtfully: "Unless, perhaps, I could manage to come to town\r\nmyself and watch the proceedings."\r\n\r\n"Ay, if you\'d be so good," said Axel.\r\n\r\nGeissler decided in a moment. "I\'ll see if I can manage it, if I can\r\nget the time. But I\'ve a heap of things to look after down south. I\'ll\r\ncome if I can. Good-bye for now. I\'ll send you those machines all\r\nright."\r\n\r\nAnd Geissler went.\r\n\r\nWould he ever come again?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rest of the workmen came down from the mine. Work is stopped. The\r\nfjeld lies dead again.\r\n\r\nThe building at Sellanraa, too, is finished now. There is a makeshift\r\nroof of turf put on for the winter; the great space beneath is divided\r\ninto rooms, bright apartments, a great salon in the middle and large\r\nrooms at either end, as if it were for human beings. Here Isak once\r\nlived in a turf hut together with a few goats--there is no turf hut to\r\nbe seen now at Sellanraa.\r\n\r\nLoose boxes, mangers, and bins are fitted up. The two stoneworkers\r\nare still busy, kept on to get the whole thing finished as soon as\r\npossible, but Gustaf is no hand at woodwork, so he says, and he is\r\nleaving. Gustaf has been a splendid lad at the stonework, heaving and\r\nlifting like a bear; and in the evenings, a joy and delight to all,\r\nplaying his mouth-organ, not to speak of helping the womenfolk,\r\ncarrying heavy pails to and from the river. But he is going now. No,\r\nGustaf is no hand at woodwork, so he says. It looks almost as if he\r\nwere in a hurry to get away.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t it wait till tomorrow?" says Inger.\r\n\r\nNo, it can\'t wait, he\'s no more work to do here, and besides, going\r\nnow, he will have company across the hills, going over with the last;\r\ngang from the mines.\r\n\r\n"And who\'s to help me with my buckets now?" says Inger, smiling sadly.\r\n\r\nBut Gustaf is never at a loss, he has his answer ready, and says\r\n"Hjalmar." Now Hjalmar was the younger of the two stoneworkers, but\r\nneither of them was young as Gustaf himself, none like him in any way.\r\n\r\n"Hjalmar--huh!" says Inger contemptuously. Then suddenly she changes\r\nher tone, and turns to Gustaf, thinking to make him jealous. "Though,\r\nafter all, he\'s nice to have on the place, is Hjalmar," says she, "and\r\nso prettily he sings and all."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t think much of him, anyway," says Gustaf. He does not seem\r\njealous in the least.\r\n\r\n"But you might stay one more night at least?"\r\n\r\nNo, Gustaf couldn\'t stay one more night--he was going across with the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nAy, maybe Gustaf was getting tired of the game by now. \'Twas a fine\r\nthing to snap her up in front of all the rest, and have her for his\r\nown the few weeks he was there--but he was going elsewhere now, like\r\nas not to a sweetheart at home--he had other things in view. Was he to\r\nstay on loafing about here for the sake of her? He had reason enough\r\nfor bringing the thing to an end, as she herself must know; but she\r\nwas grown so bold, so thoughtless of any consequence, she seemed to\r\ncare for nothing. No, things had not held for so very long between\r\nthem--but long enough to last out the spell of his work there.\r\n\r\nInger is sad and down-hearted enough; ay, so erringly faithful that\r\nshe mourns for him. \'Tis hard for her; she is honestly in love,\r\nwithout any thought of vanity or conquest. And not ashamed, no; she\r\nis a strong woman full of weakness; she is but following the law of\r\nnature all about her; it is the glow of autumn in her as in all things\r\nelse. Her breast heaves with feeling as she packs up food for Gustaf\r\nto take with him. No thought of whether she has the right, of whether\r\nshe dare risk this or that; she gives herself up to it entirely,\r\nhungry to taste, to enjoy. Isak might lift her up to the roof and\r\nthrust her to the floor again--ay, what of that! It would not make her\r\nfeel the less.\r\n\r\nShe goes out with the parcel to Gustaf.\r\n\r\nNow she had set the bucket by the steps on purpose, in case he should\r\ncare to go with her to the river just once more. Maybe she would like\r\nto say something, to give him some little thing--her gold ring; Heaven\r\nknows, she was in a state to do anything. But there must be an end of\r\nit some time; Gustaf thanks her, says good-bye, and goes.\r\n\r\nAnd there she stands.\r\n\r\n"Hjalmar!" she calls out aloud--oh, so much louder than she need. As\r\nif she were determined to be gay in spite of all--or crying out in\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\nGustaf goes on his way....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll through that autumn there was the usual work in the fields all\r\nround, right away down to the village: potatoes to be taken up, corn\r\nto be got in, the horned cattle let loose over the ground. Eight\r\nfarms there are now and all are busy; but at the trading station, at\r\nStorborg, there are no cattle, and no green lands, only a garden. And\r\nthere is no trade there now, and nothing for any to be busy about\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThey have a new root crop at Sellanraa called turnips, sending up a\r\ncolossal growth of green waving leaves out of the earth, and nothing\r\ncan keep the cows away from them--the beasts break down all hedgework,\r\nand storm in, bellowing. Nothing for it but to set Leopoldine and\r\nlittle Rebecca to keep guard over the turnip fields, and little\r\nRebecca walks about with a big stick in her hand and is a wonder at\r\ndriving cows away. Her father is at work close by; now and again\r\nhe comes up to feel her hands and feet, and ask if she is cold.\r\nLeopoldine is big and grown up now; she can knit stockings and mittens\r\nfor the winter while she is watching the herds. Born in Trondhjem, was\r\nLeopoldine, and came to Sellanraa five years old. But the memory of\r\na great town with many people and of a long voyage on a steamer is\r\nslipping away from her now, growing more and more distant; she is a\r\nchild of the wilds and knows nothing now of the great world beyond the\r\nvillage down below where she has been to church once or twice, and\r\nwhere she was confirmed the year before....\r\n\r\nAnd the little casual work of every day goes on, with this thing and\r\nthat to be done beside; as, for instance, the road down below, that is\r\ngetting bad one or two places. The ground is still workable, and Isak\r\ngoes down one day with Sivert, ditching and draining the road. There\r\nare two patches of bog to be drained.\r\n\r\nAxel Stroem has promised to take part in the work, seeing that he has a\r\nhorse and uses the road himself--but Axel had pressing business in the\r\ntown just then. Heaven knows what it could be, but very pressing, he\r\nsaid it was. But he had asked his brother from Breidablik to work with\r\nthem in his stead.\r\n\r\nFredrik was this brother\'s name. A young man, newly married, a\r\nlight-hearted fellow who could make a jest, but none the worse for\r\nthat; Sivert and he are something alike. Now Fredrik had looked in at\r\nStorborg on his way up that morning, Aronsen of Storborg being his\r\nnearest neighbour, and he is full of all the trader has been telling\r\nhim. It began this way; Fredrik wanted a roll of tobacco. "I\'ll give\r\nyou a roll of tobacco when I have one," said Aronsen.\r\n\r\n"What, you\'ve no tobacco in the place?"\r\n\r\n"No, nor won\'t order any. There\'s nobody to buy it. What d\'you think I\r\nmake out of one roll of tobacco?"\r\n\r\nAy, Aronsen had been in a nasty humour that morning, sure enough; felt\r\nhe had been cheated somehow by that Swedish mining concern. Here had\r\nhe set up a store out in the wilds, and then they go and shut down the\r\nwork altogether!\r\n\r\nFredrik smiles slyly at Aronsen, and makes fun of him now. "He\'s not\r\nso much as touched that land of his," says he, "and hasn\'t even feed\r\nfor his beasts, but must go and buy it. Asked me if I\'d any hay to\r\nsell. No, I\'d no hay to sell. \'Ho, d\'you mean you don\'t want to make\r\nmoney?\' said Aronsen. Thinks money\'s everything in the world, seems\r\nlike. Puts down a hundred-_Krone_ note on the counter, and says\r\n\'Money!\' \'Ay, money\'s well enough,\' says I. \'Cash down,\' says he. Ay,\r\nhe\'s just a little bit touched that way, so to speak, and his wife she\r\ngoes about with a watch and chain and all on weekdays--Lord He knows\r\nwhat can be she\'s so set on remembering to the minute."\r\n\r\nSays Sivert: "Did Aronsen say anything about a man named Geissler?"\r\n\r\n"Ay. Said something about he\'d be wanting to sell some land he\'d\r\ngot. And Aronsen was wild about it, he was--\'fellow that used to be\r\nLensmand and got turned out,\' he said, and \'like as not without so\r\nmuch as a five _Krone_ in his books, and ought to be shot!\' \'Ay, but\r\nwait a bit,\' says I, \'and maybe he\'ll sell after all.\' \'Nay,\' says\r\nAronsen, \'don\'t you believe it. I\'m a business man,\' says he, \'and\r\nI know--when one party puts up a price of two hundred and fifty\r\nthousand, and the other offers twenty-five thousand, there\'s too big a\r\ndifference; there\'ll be no deal ever come out of that. Well, let \'em\r\ngo their own way, and see what comes of it,\' says he. \'I only wish I\'d\r\nnever set my foot in this hole, and a poor thing it\'s been for me and\r\nmine.\' Then I asked him if he didn\'t think of selling out himself.\r\n\'Ay,\' says he, \'that\'s just what I\'m thinking of. This bit of\r\nbogland,\' says he, \'a hole and a desert--I\'m not making a single\r\n_Krone_ the whole day now,\' says he."\r\n\r\nThey laughed at Aronsen, and had no pity for him at all.\r\n\r\n"Think he\'ll sell out?" asks Isak.\r\n\r\n"Well, he did speak of it. And he\'s got rid of the lad he had already.\r\nAy, a curious man, a queer sort of man, that Aronsen, \'tis sure. Sends\r\naway his lad could be working on the place getting in winter fuel and\r\ncarting hay with that horse of his, but keeps on his storeman--chief\r\nclerk, he calls him. \'Tis true enough, as he says, not selling so much\r\nas a _Krone_ all day, for he\'s no stock in the place at all. And what\r\ndoes he want with a chief clerk, then? I doubt it\'ll be just by way of\r\nlooking grand and making a show, must have a man there to stand at a\r\ndesk and write up things in books. Ha ha ha! ay, looks like he\'s just\r\na little bit touched that way, is Aronsen."\r\n\r\nThe three men worked till noon, ate food from their baskets, and\r\ntalked a while. They had matters of their own to talk over, matters of\r\ngood and ill to folk on the land; no trifles, to them, but things to\r\nbe discussed warily; they are clear-minded folk, their nerves unworn,\r\nand not flying out where they should not. It is the autumn season now,\r\na silence in the woods all round; the hills are there, the sun is\r\nthere, and at evening the moon and the stars will come; all regular\r\nand certain, full of kindliness, an embrace. Men have time to rest\r\nhere, to lie in the heather, with an arm for a pillow.\r\n\r\nFredrik talks of Breidablik, how \'tis but little he\'s got done there\r\nyet awhile.\r\n\r\n"Nay," says Isak, "\'tis none so little already, I saw when I was down\r\nthat way."\r\n\r\nThis was praise from the oldest among them, the giant himself, and\r\nFredrik might well be pleased. He asks frankly enough: "Did you think\r\nso, now? Well, it\'ll be better before long. I\'ve had a deal of things\r\nto hinder this year; the house to do up, being leaky and like to fall\r\nto pieces; hayloft to take down and put up again, and no sort of room\r\nin the turf hut for beasts, seeing I\'d cow and heifer more than Brede\r\nhe\'d ever had in his time," says Fredrik proudly.\r\n\r\n"And you\'re thriving like, up here?" asks Isak.\r\n\r\n"Ay, I\'ll not say no. And wife, she\'s thriving too, why shouldn\'t we?\r\nThere\'s good room and outlook all about; we can see up and down the\r\nroad both ways. And a neat little copse by the house all pretty to\r\nlook at, birch and willow--I\'ll plant a bit more other side of the\r\nhouse when I\'ve time. And it\'s fine to see how the bogland\'s dried\r\nonly since last year\'s ditching--\'tis all a question now what\'ll grow\r\non her this year. Ay, thrive? When we\'ve house and home and land and\r\nall--\'tis enough for the two of us surely."\r\n\r\n"Ho," says Sivert slyly, "and the two of you--is that all there\'s ever\r\nto be?"\r\n\r\n"Why, as to that," says Fredrik bravely, "\'tis like enough there\'ll\r\nbe more to come. And as to thriving--well, the wife\'s not falling off\r\nanyway, by the looks of her."\r\n\r\nThey work on until evening, drawing up now and again to straighten\r\ntheir backs, and exchange a word or so.\r\n\r\n"And so you didn\'t get the tobacco?" says Sivert.\r\n\r\n"No, that\'s true. But \'twas no loss, for I\'ve no use for it, anyway,"\r\nsays Fredrik.\r\n\r\n"No use for tobacco?"\r\n\r\n"Nay. \'Twas but for to drop in at Aronsen\'s like, and hear what he\'d\r\ngot to say." And the two jesters laughed together at that.\r\n\r\nOn the way home, father and son talk little, as was their way; but\r\nIsak must have been thinking out something for himself; he says:\r\n\r\n"Sivert?"\r\n\r\n"Ay?" says Sivert again.\r\n\r\n"Nay, \'twas nothing."\r\n\r\nThey walk on a good ways, and Isak begins again:\r\n\r\n"How\'s he get on, then, with his trading, Aronsen, when he\'s nothing\r\nto trade with?"\r\n\r\n"Nay," says Sivert. "But there\'s not folk enough here now for him to\r\nbuy for."\r\n\r\n"Ho, you think so? Why, I suppose \'tis so, ay, well...."\r\n\r\nSivert wondered a little at this. After a while his father went on\r\nagain:\r\n\r\n"There\'s but eight places now in all, but there might be more before\r\nlong. More ... well, I don\'t know...."\r\n\r\nSivert wondering more than ever--what can his father be getting at?\r\nThe pair of them walk on a long way in silence; they are nearly home\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n"H\'m," says Isak. "What you think Aronsen he\'d ask for that place of\r\nhis now?"\r\n\r\n"Ho, that\'s it!" says Sivert. "Want to buy it, do you?" he asks\r\njestingly. But suddenly he understands what it all means: \'tis Eleseus\r\nthe old man has in mind. Oh, he\'s not forgotten him after all, but\r\nkept him faithfully in mind, just as his mother, only in his own way,\r\nnearer earth, and nearer to Sellanraa.\r\n\r\n"\'Twill be going for a reasonable price, I doubt," says Sivert. And\r\nwhen Sivert says so much, his father knows the lad has read his\r\nthought. And as if in fear of having spoken out too clearly, he falls\r\nto talking of their road-mending; a good thing they had got it done at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nFor a couple of days after that, Sivert and his mother were putting\r\ntheir heads together and holding councils and whispering--ay, they\r\neven wrote a letter. And when Saturday came round Sivert suddenly\r\nwanted to go down to the village.\r\n\r\n"What you want to go down village again for now?" said his father in\r\ndispleasure. "Wearing boots to rags...." Oh, Isak was more bitter than\r\nneed be; he knew well enough that Sivert was going to the post.\r\n\r\n"Going to church," says Sivert.\r\n\r\n\'Twas all he could find by way of excuse, and his father muttered:"\r\nWell, what you want to go for ...?"\r\n\r\nBut if Sivert was going to church, why, he might harness up and take\r\nlittle Rebecca with him. Little Rebecca, ay, surely she might have\r\nthat bit of a treat for once in her life, after being so clever\r\nguarding turnips and being all ways the pearl and blessing of them\r\nall, ay, that she was. And they harnessed up, and Rebecca had the maid\r\nJensine to look after her on the way, and Sivert said never a word\r\nagainst that either.\r\n\r\nWhile they are away, it so happens that Aronsen\'s man, his chief\r\nclerk, from Storborg, comes up the road. What does this mean? Why,\r\nnothing very much, \'tis only Andresen, the chief clerk from Storborg,\r\ncome up for a bit of a walk this way--his master having sent him.\r\nNothing more. And no great excitement among the folk at Sellanraa over\r\nthat--\'twas not as in the old days, when a stranger was a rare sight\r\non their new land, and Inger made a great to-do. No, Inger\'s grown\r\nquieter now, and keeps to herself these days.\r\n\r\nA strange thing that book of devotion, a guide upon the way, an arm\r\nround one\'s neck, no less. When Inger had lost hold of herself a\r\nlittle, lost her way a little out plucking berries, she found her way\r\nhome again by the thought of her little chamber and the holy book; ay,\r\nshe was humble now and a Godfearing soul. She can remember long\r\nyears ago when she would say an evil word if she pricked her finger\r\nsewing--so she had learned to do from her fellow-workers round the big\r\ntable in the Institute. But now she pricks her finger, and it bleeds,\r\nand she sucks the blood away in silence. \'Tis no little victory gained\r\nto change one\'s nature so. And Inger did more than that. When all the\r\nworkmen were gone, and the stone building was finished, and Sellanraa\r\nwas all forsaken and still, then came a critical time for Inger; she\r\ncried a deal, and suffered much. She blamed none but herself for it\r\nall, and she was deeply humbled. If only she could have spoken out to\r\nIsak, and relieved her mind, but that was not their way at Sellanraa;\r\nthere was none of them would talk their feelings and confess things.\r\nAll she could do was to be extra careful in the way she asked her\r\nhusband to come in to meals, going right up to him to say it nicely,\r\ninstead of shouting from the door. And in the evenings, she looked\r\nover his clothes, and sewed buttons on. Ay, and even more she did. One\r\nnight she lifted up on her elbow and said:\r\n\r\n"Isak?"\r\n\r\n"What is it?" says Isak.\r\n\r\n"Are you awake?"\r\n\r\n"Ay."\r\n\r\n"Nay, \'twas nothing," says Inger. "But I\'ve not been all as I ought."\r\n\r\n"What?" says Isak. Ay, so much he said, and rose up on his elbow in\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nThey lay there, and went on talking. Inger is a matchless woman, after\r\nall; and with a full heart, "I\'ve not been as I ought towards you,"\r\nshe says, "and I\'m that sorry about it."\r\n\r\nThe simple words move him; this barge of a man is touched, ay, he\r\nwants to comfort her, knowing nothing of what is the matter, but only\r\nthat there is none like her. "Naught to cry about, my dear," says\r\nIsak. "There\'s none of us can be as we ought."\r\n\r\n"Nay, \'tis true," she answers gratefully. Oh, Isak had a strong, sound\r\nway of taking things; straightened them out, he did, when they turned\r\ncrooked. "None of us can be as we ought." Ay, he was right. The god of\r\nthe heart--for all that he is a god, he goes a deal of crooked ways,\r\ngoes out adventuring, the wild thing that he is, and we can see it in\r\nhis looks. One day rolling in a bed of roses and licking his lips and\r\nremembering things; next day with a thorn in his foot, desperately\r\ntrying to get it out. Die of it? Never a bit, he\'s as well as ever. A\r\nnice look-out it would be if he were to die!\r\n\r\nAnd Inger\'s trouble passed off too; she got over it, but she keeps\r\non with her hours of devotion, and finds a merciful refuge there.\r\nHard-working and patient and good she is now every day, knowing Isak\r\ndifferent from all other men, and wanting none but him. No gay young\r\nspark of a singer, true, in his looks and ways, but good enough, ay,\r\ngood enough indeed! And once more it is seen that the fear of the Lord\r\nand contentment therewith are a precious gain.\r\n\r\nAnd now it was that the little chief clerk from Storborg, Andresen,\r\ncame up to Sellanraa one Sunday, and Inger was not in the least\r\naffected, far from it; she did not so much as go in herself to give\r\nhim a mug of milk, but sent Leopoldine in with it, by reason that\r\nJensine the maid was out. And Leopoldine could carry a mug of milk as\r\nwell as need be, and she gave it him and said, "Here you are," and\r\nblushed, for all she was wearing her Sunday clothes and had nothing to\r\nbe ashamed of, anyway.\r\n\r\n"Thanks, \'tis overkind of you," says Andresen. "Is your father at\r\nhome?" says he.\r\n\r\n"Ay; he\'ll be about the place somewhere."\r\n\r\nAndresen drank and wiped his mouth with a handkerchief and looked at\r\nthe time. "Is it far up to the mines?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"No, \'tis an hour\'s walk, or hardly that."\r\n\r\n"I\'m going up to look over them, d\'you see, for him, Aronsen--I\'m his\r\nchief clerk."\r\n\r\n"Ho!"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll know me yourself, no doubt; I\'m Aronsen\'s chief clerk. You\'ve\r\nbeen down buying things at our place before."\r\n\r\n"Ay."\r\n\r\n"And I remember you well enough," says Andresen. "You\'ve been down\r\ntwice buying things."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis more than could be thought, you\'d remember that," says\r\nLeopoldine, and had no more strength after that, but stood holding by\r\na chair.\r\n\r\nBut Andresen had strength enough, he went on, and said: "Remember you?\r\nWell, of course I should." And he said more:\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t like to walk up to the mine with me?" said he.\r\n\r\nAnd a little after something went wrong with Leopoldine\'s eyes;\r\neverything turned red and strange about her, and the floor was\r\nslipping away from under, and Chief Clerk Andresen was talking from\r\nsomewhere ever so far off. Saying: "Couldn\'t you spare the time?"\r\n\r\n"No," says she.\r\n\r\nAnd Heaven knows how she managed to get out of the kitchen again. Her\r\nmother looked at her and asked what was the matter. "Nothing," said\r\nLeopoldine.\r\n\r\nNothing, no, of course. But now, look you, \'twas Leopoldine\'s turn to\r\nbe affected, to begin the same eternal round. She was well fitted\r\nfor the same, overgrown and pretty and newly confirmed; an excellent\r\nsacrifice she would make. A bird is fluttering in her young breast,\r\nher long hands are like her mother\'s, full of tenderness, full of sex.\r\nCould she dance?--ay, indeed she could. A marvel where she had managed\r\nto learn it, but learn it they did at Sellanraa as well as elsewhere.\r\nSivert could dance, and Leopoldine too; a kind of dancing peculiar\r\nto the spot, growth of the new-cleared soil; a dance with energy and\r\nswing: schottische, mazurka, waltz and polka in one. And could not\r\nLeopoldine deck herself out and fall in love and dream by daylight all\r\nawake? Ay, as well as any other! The day she stood in church she was\r\nallowed to borrow her mother\'s gold ring to wear; no sin in that,\r\n\'twas only neat and nice; and the day after, going to her communion,\r\nshe did not get the ring on till it was over. Ay, she might well show\r\nherself in church with a gold ring on her finger, being the daughter\r\nof a great man on the place--the Margrave.\r\n\r\nWhen Andresen came down from the mine, he found Isak at Sellanraa, and\r\nthey asked him in, gave him dinner and a cup of coffee. All the\r\nfolk on the place were in there together now, and took part in the\r\nconversation. Andresen explained that his master, Aronsen, had sent\r\nhim up to see how things were at the mines, if there was any sign of\r\nbeginning work there again soon. Heaven knows, maybe Andresen sat\r\nthere lying all the time, about being sent by his master; he might\r\njust as well have hit on it for his own account--and anyway, he\r\ncouldn\'t have been at the mines at all in the little time he\'d been\r\naway.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis none so easy to see from outside if they\'re going to start work\r\nagain," said Isak.\r\n\r\nNo, Andresen admitted that was so; but Aronsen had sent him, and after\r\nall, two pair of eyes could see better than one.\r\n\r\nBut here Inger seemingly could contain herself no longer; she asked:\r\n"Is it true what they\'re saying, Aronsen is going to sell his place\r\nagain?"\r\n\r\nAndresen answers: "He\'s thinking of it. And a man like him can surely\r\ndo as he likes, seeing all the means and riches he\'s got."\r\n\r\n"Ho, is he so rich, then?"\r\n\r\n"Ay," says Andresen, nodding his head; "rich enough, and that\'s a true\r\nword."\r\n\r\nAgain Inger cannot keep silence, but asks right out:\r\n\r\n"I wonder, now, what he\'d be asking for the place?"\r\n\r\nIsak puts in a word here; like as not he\'s more curious to know than\r\nInger herself, but it must not seem that the idea of buying Storborg\r\nis any thought of his; he makes himself a stranger to it, and says\r\nnow:\r\n\r\n"Why, what you want to know for, Inger?"\r\n\r\n"I was but asking," says she. And both of them look at Andresen,\r\nwaiting. And he answers:\r\n\r\nAnswers cautiously enough that as to the price, he can say nothing of\r\nthat, but he knows what Aronsen says the place has cost him.\r\n\r\n"And how much is that?" asks Inger, having no strength to keep her\r\npeace and be silent.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis sixteen hundred _Kroner_" says Andresen.\r\n\r\nHo, and Inger claps her hands at once to hear it, for if there is one\r\nthing womenfolk have no sense nor thought of, \'tis the price of land\r\nand properties. But, anyway, sixteen hundred _Kroner_ is no small sum\r\nfor folk in the wilds, and Inger has but one fear, that Isak may be\r\nfrightened off the deal. But Isak, he sits there just exactly like a\r\nfjeld, and says only: "Ay, it\'s the big houses he\'s put up."\r\n\r\n"Ay," says Andresen again, "\'tis just that. \'Tis the fine big houses\r\nand all."\r\n\r\nJust when Andresen is making ready to go, Leopoldine slips out by the\r\ndoor. A strange thing, but somehow she cannot bring herself to think\r\nof shaking hands with him. So she has found a good place, standing in\r\nthe new cowshed, looking out of a window. And with a blue silk ribbon\r\nround her neck, that she hadn\'t been wearing before, and a wonder she\r\never found time to put it on now. There he goes, a trifle short and\r\nstout, spry on his feet, with a light, full beard, eight or ten years\r\nolder than herself. Ay, none so bad-looking to her mind!\r\n\r\nAnd then the party came back from church late on Sunday night. All had\r\ngone well, little Rebecca had slept the last few hours of the way\r\nup, and was lifted from the cart and carried indoors without waking.\r\nSivert has heard a deal of news, but when his mother asks, "Well, what\r\nyou\'ve got to tell?" he only says: "Nay, nothing much. Axel he\'s got a\r\nmowing-machine and a harrow."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" says his father, all interested. "Did you see them?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, I saw them right enough. Down on the quay."\r\n\r\n"Ho! So that was what he must go in to town for," says his father.\r\nAnd Sivert sits there swelling with pride at knowing better, but says\r\nnever a word.\r\n\r\nHis father might just as well believe that Axel\'s pressing business in\r\nthe town had been to buy machines; his mother too might think so\r\nfor all that. Ho, but there was neither of them thought so in their\r\nhearts; they had heard whispers enough of what was the matter; of a\r\nnew child-murder case in the wilds.\r\n\r\n"Time for bed," says his father at last.\r\n\r\nSivert goes off to bed, swelling with knowledge. Axel had been\r\nsummoned for examination; \'twas a big affair--the Lensmand had gone\r\nwith him--so big indeed that the Lensmand\'s lady, who had just had\r\nanother child, had left the baby and was gone in to town with her\r\nhusband. She had promised to put in a word to the jury herself.\r\n\r\nGossip and scandal all abroad in the village now, and Sivert saw well\r\nenough that a certain earlier crime of the same sort was being called\r\nto mind again. Outside the church, the groups would stop talking as he\r\ncame up, and had he not been the man he was, perhaps some would have\r\nturned away from him. Good to be Sivert those days, a man from a big\r\nplace to begin with, son of a wealthy landowner--and then beside, to\r\nbe known as a clever fellow, a good worker; he ranked before others,\r\nand was looked up to for himself. Sivert had always been well liked\r\namong folk. If only Jensine did not learn too much before they got\r\nhome that day! And Sivert had his own affairs to think of--ay, folk in\r\nthe wilds can blush and pale as well as other. He had seen Jensine as\r\nshe left the church with little Rebecca; she had seen him too, but\r\nwent by. He waited a bit, and then drove over to the smith\'s to fetch\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThey were sitting at table, all the family at dinner. Sivert is asked\r\nto join them, but has had his dinner, thanks. They knew he would be\r\ncoming, they might have waited that bit of a while for him--so they\r\nwould have done at Sellanraa, but not here, it seemed.\r\n\r\n"Nay, \'tis not what you\'re used to, I dare say," says the smith\'s\r\nwife. And, "What news from church?" says the smith, for all he had\r\nbeen at church himself.\r\n\r\nWhen Jensine and little Rebecca were seated up in the cart again, says\r\nthe smith\'s wife to her daughter: "Well, good-bye, Jensine; we\'ll\r\nbe wanting you home again soon." And that could be taken two ways,\r\nthought Sivert, but he said nothing. If the speech had been more\r\ndirect, more plain and outspoken, he might perhaps ... He waits, with\r\npuckered brows, but no more is said.\r\n\r\nThey drive up homeward, and little Rebecca is the only one with a word\r\nto say; she is full of the wonder of going to church, the priest in\r\nhis dress with a silver cross, and the lights and the organ music.\r\nAfter a long while Jensine says: "\'Tis a shameful thing about Barbro\r\nand all."\r\n\r\n"What did your mother mean about you coming home soon?" asked Sivert.\r\n\r\n"What she meant?"\r\n\r\n"Ay. You thinking of leaving us, then?"\r\n\r\n"Why, they\'ll be wanting me home some time, I doubt," says she.\r\n\r\n"_Ptro_!" says Sivert, stopping his horse. "Like me to drive back with\r\nyou now, perhaps?"\r\n\r\nJensine looks at him; he is pale as death.\r\n\r\n"No," says she. And a little after she begins to cry.\r\n\r\nRebecca looks in surprise from one to the other. Oh, but little\r\nRebecca was a good one to have on a journey like that; she took\r\nJensine\'s part and patted her and made her smile again. And when\r\nlittle Rebecca looked threateningly at her brother and said she was\r\ngoing to jump down and find a big stick to beat him, Sivert had to\r\nsmile too.\r\n\r\n"But what did _you_ mean, now, I\'d like to know?" says Jensine.\r\n\r\nSivert answered straight out at once: "I meant, if you don\'t care to\r\nstay with us, why, we must manage without."\r\n\r\nAnd a long while after, said Jensine: "Well, there\'s Leopoldine, she\'s\r\nbig now, and fit and all to do my work, seems."\r\n\r\nAy, \'twas a sorrowful journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\n\r\n\r\nA man walks up the way through the hills. Wind and rain; the autumn\r\ndownpour has begun, but the man cares little for that, he looks glad\r\nat heart, and glad he is. \'Tis Axel Stroem, coming back from the\r\ntown and the court and all--they have let him go free. Ay, a happy\r\nman--first of all, there\'s a mowing-machine and a harrow for him down\r\nat the quay, and more than that, he\'s free, and not guilty. Had taken\r\nno part in the killing of a child. Ay, so things can turn out!\r\n\r\nBut the times he had been through! Standing there as a witness, this\r\ntoiler in the fields had known the hardest days of his life. \'Twas no\r\ngain to him to make Barbro\'s guilt seem greater, and for that reason\r\nhe was careful not to say too much, he did not even say all he knew;\r\nevery word had to be dragged out of him, and he answered mostly with\r\nbut "Yes" and "No." Was it not enough? Was he to make more of it than\r\nthere was already? Oh, but there were times when it looked serious\r\nindeed; there were the men of Law, black-robed and dangerous, easy\r\nenough for them, it seemed, just with a word or so, to turn the whole\r\nthing as they pleased, and have him sentenced. But they were kindly\r\nfolk after all, and did not try to bring him to destruction. Also, as\r\nit happened, there were powerful influences at work trying to save\r\nBarbro, and it was all to his advantage as well.\r\n\r\nThen what on earth was there for him to trouble about?\r\n\r\nBarbro herself would hardly try to make things look worse than need be\r\nfor her former master and lover; he knew terrible things about this\r\nand an earlier affair of the same sort; she could not be such a fool.\r\nNo, Barbro was clever enough; she said a good word for Axel, and\r\ndeclared that he had known nothing of her having borne a child till\r\nafter it was all over. He was different in some ways, perhaps, from\r\nother men, and they did not always get on well together, but a quiet\r\nman, and a good man in every way. No, it was true he had dug a new\r\ngrave and buried the body away there, but that was long after, and\r\nby reason he had thought the first place was not dry enough, though\r\nindeed it was, and \'twas only Axel\'s odd way of thinking.\r\n\r\nWhat need, then, for Axel to fear at all when Barbro took all the\r\nblame on herself that way? And as for Barbro herself, there were\r\nmighty influences at work.\r\n\r\nFru Lensmand Heyerdahl had taken up the case. She went about to high\r\nand low, never sparing herself, demanded to be called as a witness,\r\nand made a speech in court. When her turn came, she stood there before\r\nthem all and was a great lady indeed; she took up the question of\r\ninfanticide in all its aspects, and gave the court a long harangue\r\non the subject--it almost seemed as if she had obtained permission\r\nbeforehand to say what she pleased. Ay, folk might say what they would\r\nof Fru Lensmand Heyerdahl, but make a speech, that she could, and was\r\nlearned in politics and social questions, no doubt about that. \'Twas\r\na marvel where she found all her words. Now and again the presiding\r\njustice seemed wishful to keep her to the point, but maybe he had not\r\nthe heart to interrupt, and let her run on. And at the end of it all,\r\nshe volunteered one or two useful items of information, and made a\r\nstartling offer to the court.\r\n\r\nLeaving out all legal technicalities, what took place was this:\r\n\r\n"We women," said Fru Heyerdahl, "we are an unfortunate and oppressed\r\nmoiety of humanity. It is the men who make the laws, and we women have\r\nnot a word to say in the matter. But can any man put himself in the\r\nposition of a woman in childbirth? Has he ever felt the dread of it,\r\never known the terrible pangs, ever cried aloud in the anguish of that\r\nhour?\r\n\r\n"In the present instance, it is a servant-girl who has borne the\r\nchild. A girl, unmarried, and consequently trying all through the\r\ncritical time to hide her condition. And why must she seek to hide it?\r\nBecause of society. Society despises the unmarried woman who bears\r\na child. Not only does society offer her no protection, but it\r\npersecutes her, pursues her with contempt and disgrace. Atrocious! No\r\nhuman creature with any heart at all could help feeling indignant at\r\nsuch a state of things. Not only is the girl to bring a child into the\r\nworld, a thing in itself surely hard enough, but she is to be treated\r\nas a criminal for that very fact. I will venture to say that it was\r\nwell for the unfortunate girl now accused before the court that her\r\nchild was born by accident when she fell into the water, and drowned.\r\nWell for herself and for the child. As long as society maintains its\r\npresent attitude, an unmarried mother should be counted guiltless even\r\nif she does kill her child."\r\n\r\nHere a slight murmur was heard from the presiding justice.\r\n\r\n"Or at any rate, her punishment should be merely nominal," said Fru\r\nHeyerdahl. "We are all agreed, of course," she went on, "that infant\r\nlife should be preserved, but is that to mean that no law of simple\r\nhumanity is to apply to the unfortunate mother? Think, consider\r\nwhat she has been through during all the period of pregnancy, what\r\nsuffering she has endured in striving to hide her condition, and all\r\nthe time never knowing where to turn for herself and the child when it\r\ncomes. No man can imagine it," said she. "The child is at least killed\r\nin kindness. The mother tries to save herself and the child she loves\r\nfrom the misery of its life. The shame is more than she can bear, and\r\nso the plan gradually forms itself in her mind, to put the child out\r\nof the way. The birth takes place in secret, and the mother is for\r\nfour-and-twenty hours in such a delirious state that at the moment\r\nof killing the child she is simply not responsible for her actions.\r\nPractically speaking, she has not herself committed the act at all,\r\nbeing out of her senses at the time. With every bone in her body\r\naching still after her delivery, she has to take the little creature\'s\r\nlife and hide away the body--think what an effort of will is demanded\r\nhere! Naturally, we all wish all children to live; we are distressed\r\nat the thought that any should be exterminated in such a way. But\r\nit is the fault of society that it is so; the fault of a hopeless,\r\nmerciless, scandalmongering, mischievous, and evil-minded society,\r\never on the watch to crush an unmarried mother by every means in its\r\npower!\r\n\r\n"But--even after such treatment at the hands of society, the\r\npersecuted mother can rise up again. It often happens that these\r\ngirls, after one false step of the sort, are led by that very fact to\r\ndevelop their best and noblest qualities. Let the court inquire of the\r\nsuperintendents at refuge homes, where unmarried mothers and their\r\nchildren are received, if this is not the case. And experience has\r\nshown that it is just such girls who have--whom society has forced to\r\nkill their own children, that make the best nurses. Surely that was a\r\nmatter for any and all to think seriously about?\r\n\r\n"Then there is another side of the question. Why is the man to go\r\nfree? The mother found guilty of infanticide is thrust into prison and\r\ntortured, but the father, the seducer, he is never touched. Yet being\r\nas he is the cause of the child\'s existence, he is a party to the\r\ncrime; his share in it, indeed, is greater than the mother\'s; had it\r\nnot been for him, there would have been no crime. Then why should he\r\nbe acquitted? Because the laws are made by men. There is the answer.\r\nThe enormity of such man-made laws cries of itself to Heaven for\r\nintervention. And there can be no help for us women till we are\r\nallowed a say in the elections, and in the making of laws, ourselves.\r\n\r\n"But," said Fru Heyerdahl, "if this is the terrible fate that is meted\r\nout to the guilty--or, let us say, the more clearly guilty--unmarried\r\nmother who has killed her child, what of the innocent one who is\r\nmerely suspected of the crime, and has not committed it? What\r\nreparation does society offer to her? None at all! I can testify that\r\nI know the girl here accused; have known her since she was a child;\r\nshe has been in my service, and her father is my husband\'s assistant.\r\nWe women venture to think and feel directly in opposition to men\'s\r\naccusations and persecution; we dare to have our own opinion. The girl\r\nthere has been arrested, deprived of her liberty, on suspicion of\r\nhaving in the first place concealed the birth of a child, and further\r\nof having killed the child so born. I have no doubt in my own mind\r\nthat she is not guilty of either--the court will itself arrive at this\r\nself-evident conclusion. Concealment of birth--the child was born in\r\nthe middle of the day. True, the mother is alone at the time--but who\r\ncould have been with her in any case? The place is far away in the\r\nwilds, the only living soul within reach is a man--how could she\r\nsend for a man at such a moment? Any woman will tell you it is\r\nimpossible--not to be thought of. And then--it is alleged that she\r\nmust have killed the child after. But the child was born in the\r\nwater--the mother falls down in an icy stream, and the child is born.\r\nWhat was she doing by the water? She is a servant-girl, a slave, that\r\nis to say, and has her daily work to do; she is going to fetch juniper\r\ntwigs for cleaning. And crossing the stream, she slips and falls in.\r\nAnd there she lies; the child is born, and is drowned in the water."\r\n\r\nFru Heyerdahl stopped. She could see from the look of the court and\r\nthe spectators that she had spoken wonderfully well; there was a great\r\nsilence in the place, only Barbro sat dabbing her eyes now and again\r\nfor sheer emotion. And Fru Heyerdahl closed with these words: "We\r\nwomen have some heart, some feeling. I have left my own children in\r\nthe care of strangers to travel all this way and appear as a witness\r\non behalf of the unfortunate girl sitting there. Men\'s laws cannot\r\nprevent women from thinking; and I think this, that the girl there has\r\nbeen punished sufficiently for no crime. Acquit her, let her go free,\r\nand I will take charge of her myself. She will make the best nurse I\r\nhave ever had."\r\n\r\nAnd Fru Heyerdahl stepped down.\r\n\r\nSays the justice then: "But I think you said a moment ago that the\r\nbest nurses were those who _had_ killed their children?"\r\n\r\nOh, but the justice was not of a mind to go against Fru Heyerdahl, not\r\nin the least--he was as humane as could be himself, a man as gentle as\r\na priest. When the advocate for the Crown put a few questions to the\r\nwitness afterwards, the justice sat for the most part making notes on\r\nsome papers.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings lasted only till a little over noon; there were few\r\nwitnesses, and the case was clear enough. Axel Stroem sat hoping for\r\nthe best, then suddenly it seemed as if the advocate for the Crown\r\nand Fru Heyerdahl were joining forces to make things awkward for him,\r\nbecause he had buried the body instead of notifying the death. He was\r\ncross-examined somewhat sharply on this point, and would likely enough\r\nhave come out badly if he had not all at once caught sight of Geissler\r\nsitting in the court. Ay, \'twas right enough, Geissler was there. This\r\ngave Axel courage, he no longer felt himself alone against the Law\r\nthat was determined to beat him down. And Geissler nodded to him.\r\n\r\nAy, Geissler was come to town. He had not asked to be called as a\r\nwitness, but he was there. He had also spent a couple of days before\r\nthe case came on in going into the matter himself, and noting down\r\nwhat he remembered of Axel\'s own account given him at Maaneland. Most\r\nof the documents seemed to Geissler somewhat unsatisfactory; this\r\nLensmand Heyerdahl was evidently a narrow-minded person, who had\r\nthroughout endeavoured to prove complicity on Axel\'s part. Fool, idiot\r\nof a man--what did he know of life in the wilds, when he could see\r\nthat the child was just what Axel had counted on to keep the woman,\r\nhis helpmeet, on the place!\r\n\r\nGeissler spoke to the advocate for the Crown, but it seemed there was\r\nlittle need of intervention there; he wanted to help Axel back to his\r\nfarm and his land, but Axel was in no need of help, from the looks\r\nof things. For the case was going well as far as Barbro herself was\r\nconcerned, and if she were acquitted, then there could be no question\r\nof any complicity at all. It would depend on the testimony of the\r\nwitnesses.\r\n\r\nWhen the few witnesses had been heard--Oline had not been summoned,\r\nbut only the Lensmand, Axel himself, the experts, a couple of girls\r\nfrom the village--when they had been heard, it was time to adjourn for\r\nthe midday break, and Geissler went up to the advocate for the Crown\r\nonce more. The advocate was of opinion that all was going well for the\r\ngirl Barbro, and so much the better. Fru Lensmand Heyerdahl\'s words\r\nhad carried great weight. All depended now upon the finding of the\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n"Are you at all interested in the girl?" asked the advocate.\r\n\r\n"Why, to a certain extent," answered Geissler--"or rather, perhaps, in\r\nthe man."\r\n\r\n"Has she been in your service too?"\r\n\r\n"No, he\'s never been in my service."\r\n\r\n"I was speaking of the girl. It\'s she that has the sympathy of the\r\ncourt."\r\n\r\n"No, she\'s never been in my service at all."\r\n\r\n"The man--h\'m, he doesn\'t seem to come out of it so well," said\r\nthe advocate. "Goes off and buries the body all by himself in the\r\nwood--looks bad, very bad."\r\n\r\n"He wanted to have it buried properly, I suppose," said Geissler. "It\r\nhadn\'t been really buried at all at first."\r\n\r\n"Well, of course a woman hadn\'t the strength of a man to go digging.\r\nAnd in her state--she must have been done up already. Altogether,"\r\nsaid the advocate, "I think we\'ve come to take a more humane view of\r\nthese infanticide cases generally, of late. If I were to judge, I\r\nshould never venture to condemn the girl at all; and from what has\r\nappeared in this case, I shall not venture to demand a conviction."\r\n\r\n"Very pleased to hear it," said Geissler, with a bow.\r\n\r\nThe advocate went on: "As a man, as a private person, I will even go\r\nfurther, and say: I would never condemn a single unmarried mother for\r\nkilling her child."\r\n\r\n"Most interesting," said Geissler, "to find the advocate for the Crown\r\nso entirely in agreement with what Fru Heyerdahl said before the\r\ncourt."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Fru Heyerdahl!... Still, to my mind, there was a great deal in\r\nwhat she said. After all, what is the good of all these convictions?\r\nUnmarried mothers have suffered enough beforehand, and been brought so\r\nlow in every human regard by the brutal and callous attitude of the\r\nworld--the punishment ought to suffice."\r\n\r\nGeissler rose, and said at last: "No doubt. But what about the\r\nchildren?"\r\n\r\n"True," said the advocate, "it\'s a sad business about the children.\r\nStill, all things considered, perhaps it\'s just as well. Illegitimate\r\nchildren have a hard time, and turn out badly as often as not."\r\n\r\nGeissler felt perhaps some touch of malice at the portly complacency\r\nof the man of law; he said:\r\n\r\n"Erasmus was born out of wedlock."\r\n\r\n"Erasmus ...?"\r\n\r\n"Erasmus of Rotterdam."\r\n\r\n"H\'m."\r\n\r\n"And Leonardo the same."\r\n\r\n"Leonardo da Vinci? Really? Well, of course, there are exceptions,\r\notherwise there would be no rule. But on the whole...."\r\n\r\n"We pass protective measures for beast and bird," said Geissler;\r\n"seems rather strange, doesn\'t it, not to trouble about our own\r\nyoung?"\r\n\r\nThe advocate for the Crown reached out slowly and with dignity after\r\nsome papers on the table, as a hint that he had not time to continue\r\nthe discussion. "Yes...." said he absently. "Yes, yes, no doubt...."\r\n\r\nGeissler expressed his thanks for a most instructive conversation, and\r\ntook his leave.\r\n\r\nHe sat down in the court-house again, to be there in good time. He\r\nwas not ill-pleased, maybe, to feel his power; he had knowledge of a\r\ncertain piece of wrapping, a man\'s shirt cut across, to carry--let us\r\nsay twigs for a broom; of the body of a child floating in the harbour\r\nat Bergen--ay, he could make matters awkward for the court if he\r\nchose; a word from him would be as effective as a thousand swords. But\r\nGeissler had doubtless no intention of uttering that word now unless\r\nit were needed. Things were going splendidly without; even the\r\nadvocate for the Crown had declared himself on the side of the\r\naccused.\r\n\r\nThe room fills, and the court is sitting again.\r\n\r\nAn interesting comedy to watch in a little town. The warning gravity\r\nof the advocate for the Crown, the emotional eloquence of the advocate\r\nfor the defence. The court sat listening to what appeared to be its\r\nduty in regard to the case of a girl named Barbro, and the death of\r\nher child.\r\n\r\nFor all that, it was no light matter after all to decide. The advocate\r\nfor the Crown was a presentable man to look at, and doubtless also a\r\nman of heart, but something appeared to have annoyed him recently or\r\npossibly he had suddenly remembered that he held a certain office\r\nin the State and was bound to act from that point of view. An\r\nincomprehensible thing, but he was plainly less disposed to be lenient\r\nnow than he had been during the morning; if the crime had been\r\ncommitted, he said, it was a serious matter, and things would look\r\nblack indeed if they could with certainty be declared so black as\r\nwould appear from the testimony of the witnesses already heard. That\r\nwas a matter for the court to decide. He wished to draw attention to\r\nthree points: firstly, whether they had before them a concealment of\r\nbirth; whether this was clear to the court. He made some personal\r\nremarks on this head. The second point was the wrapping, the piece of\r\na shirt--why had the accused taken this with her? Was it in order to\r\nmake use of it for a certain purpose preconceived? He developed this\r\nsuggestion further. His third point was the hurried and suspicious\r\nburial, without any notification of the death to either priest or\r\nLensmand. Here, the man was the person chiefly responsible, and it\r\nwas of the utmost importance that the court should come to the right\r\nconclusion in that respect. For it was obvious that if the man were an\r\naccomplice, and had therefore undertaken the burial himself, then\r\nhis servant-girl must have committed a crime before he could be an\r\naccomplice in it.\r\n\r\n"H\'m," from some one in court.\r\n\r\nAxel Stroem felt himself again in danger. He looked up without meeting\r\na single glance; all eyes were fixed on the advocate speaking. But far\r\ndown in the court sat Geissler again, looking highly supercilious, as\r\nif bursting with his own superiority, his under-lip thrust forward,\r\nhis face turned towards the ceiling. This enormous indifference to the\r\nsolemnity of the court, and that "H\'m," uttered loudly and without\r\nconcealment, cheered Axel mightily; he felt himself no longer alone\r\nagainst the world.\r\n\r\nAnd now things took a turn again for the better. This advocate for the\r\nCrown seemed at last to think he had done enough, had achieved all\r\nthat was possible in the way of directing suspicion and ill-feeling\r\ntowards the man; and now he stopped. He did more; he almost, as it\r\nwere, faced round, and made no demand for a conviction. He ended by\r\nsaying, in so many words, that after the testimony of the witnesses in\r\nthe case, he on his part did not call upon the court to convict the\r\naccused.\r\n\r\nThis was well enough, thought Axel--the business was practically over.\r\n\r\nThen came the turn of the advocate for the defence, a young man\r\nwho had studied the law, and had now been entrusted with this most\r\nsatisfactory case. His tone itself showed the view he took of it;\r\nnever had a man been more certain of defending an innocent person than\r\nhe. Truth to tell, this Fru Heyerdahl had taken the wind out of his\r\nsails beforehand, and used several of his own intended arguments that\r\nmorning; he was annoyed at her having already exploited the "society"\r\ntheme--oh, but he could have said some first-rate things about society\r\nhimself. He was incensed at the mistaken leniency of the presiding\r\njustice in not stopping her speech; it was a defence in itself, a\r\nbrief prepared beforehand--and what was there left for him?\r\n\r\nHe began at the beginning of the life-story of the girl Barbro. Her\r\npeople were not well off, albeit industrious and respectable; she had\r\ngone out to service at an early age, first of all to the Lensmand\'s.\r\nThe court had heard that morning what her mistress, Fru Heyerdahl,\r\nthought of her--no one could wish for a finer recommendation. Barbro\r\nhad then gone to Bergen. Here the advocate laid great stress on a most\r\nfeelingly written testimonial from two young business men in whose\r\nemploy Barbro had been while at Bergen--evidently in a position of\r\ntrust. Barbro had come back to act as housekeeper for this unmarried\r\nman in an outlying district. And here her trouble began.\r\n\r\nShe found herself with child by this man. The learned counsel for the\r\nprosecution had already referred--in the most delicate and considerate\r\nmanner, be it said--to the question of concealment of birth. Had\r\nBarbro attempted to conceal her condition; had she denied being with\r\nchild? The two witnesses, girls from her own village, had been of\r\nopinion that she was in that condition; but when they had asked her,\r\nshe had not denied it at all, she had merely passed the matter off.\r\nWhat would a young girl naturally do in such a case but pass it off?\r\nNo one else had asked her about it at all. Go to her mistress and\r\nconfess? She had no mistress; she was mistress on the place herself.\r\nShe had a master, certainly, but a girl could not be expected to\r\nconfide in a man upon such a matter; she bears her cross herself; does\r\nnot sing, does not whisper, but is silent as a Trappist. Concealment?\r\nNo, but she kept herself to herself.\r\n\r\nThe child is born--a sound and healthy boy; had lived and breathed\r\nafter birth, but had been suffocated. The court had been made aware\r\nof the circumstances attending this birth: it had taken place in the\r\nwater; the mother falls into the stream, and the child is born, but\r\nshe is incapable of saving the child. She lies there, unable even to\r\nrise herself till some time after. No marks of violence were to be\r\nseen upon the body; there was nothing to indicate that it had been\r\nintentionally killed; it had been drowned by misadventure at birth,\r\nthat was all. The most natural explanation in the world.\r\n\r\nHis learned colleague had made some mention of a cloth or wrapping,\r\nconsidering it something of a mystery why she should have taken half a\r\nshirt with her that day. The mystery was clear enough; she had taken\r\nthe shirt to carry stripped juniper in. She might have taken--let us\r\nsay, a pillow-case; as it was, she had taken this piece of a. shirt.\r\nSomething she must have, in any case; she could not carry the stuff\r\nback in her hands. No, there was surely no ground for making a mystery\r\nof this.\r\n\r\nOne point, however, was not quite so clear: had the accused been\r\ntreated with the care and consideration which her condition at the\r\ntime demanded? Had her master dealt kindly with her? It would be\r\nas well for him if it were found so. The girl herself had, under\r\ncross-examination, referred to the man in satisfactory terms; and this\r\nagain was evidence in itself of her own nobility of character.\r\nThe man, on his part, Axel Stroem, had likewise in his depositions\r\nrefrained from any attempt to add to the burden of the girl, or to\r\nblame her in any way. In this he had acted rightly--not to say wisely,\r\nseeing that his own case depended very largely upon how matters went\r\nwith her. By laying the blame on her he would, if she were convicted,\r\nbring about his own downfall.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to consider the documents and depositions in the\r\npresent case without feeling the deepest sympathy for this young girl\r\nin her forsaken situation. And yet there was no need to appeal to\r\nmercy on her behalf, only to justice and human understanding. She and\r\nher master were in a way betrothed, but a certain dissimilarity of\r\ntemperament and interests prevented them from marrying. The girl could\r\nnot entrust her future to such a man. It was not a pleasant subject,\r\nbut it might be well to return for a moment to the question of the\r\nwrapping that had been spoken of before; it should here be noted that\r\nthe girl had taken, not one of her own undergarments, but one of her\r\nmaster\'s shirts. The question at once arose: had the man himself\r\noffered the material for the purpose? Here, one was at first inclined\r\nto see a possibility, at any rate, that the man, Axel, had had some\r\npart in the affair.\r\n\r\n"H\'m," from some one in court. Loud and hard--so much so, indeed,\r\nthat the speaker paused, and all looked round to see who might be\r\nresponsible for the interruption. The presiding justice frowned.\r\n\r\nBut, went on the advocate for the defence, collecting himself again,\r\nin this respect, also, we can set our minds at rest, thanks to the\r\naccused herself. It might seem well to her advantage to divide the\r\nblame here, but she had not attempted to do so. She had entirely and\r\nwithout reserve absolved Axel Stroem from any complicity whatever in\r\nthe fact of her having taken his shirt instead of something of her own\r\non her way to the water--that is, on her way to the woods to gather\r\njuniper. There was not the slightest reason for doubting the\r\nasseveration of the accused on this point; her depositions had\r\nthroughout been found in accordance with the facts, and the same was\r\nevidently the case in this. Had the shirt been given her by the man,\r\nthis would have been to presuppose a killing of the child already\r\nplanned--the accused, truthful as she was, had not attempted to\r\ncharge even this man with a crime that had never been committed. Her\r\ndemeanour throughout had been commendably frank and open; she had\r\nmade no endeavour to throw the blame on others. There were frequent\r\ninstances before the court of this delicacy of feeling on the part of\r\nthe accused, as, for instance, the fact that she had wrapped up the\r\nbody of the child as well as she could, and put it away decently, as\r\nthe Lensmand had found it.\r\n\r\nHere the presiding justice interposed, merely as a matter of form,\r\nobserving that it was grave No. 2 which the Lensmand had found--the\r\ngrave in which Axel had buried the body after its removal from the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n"True, that is true. I stand corrected," said the advocate, with\r\nall proper respect for the president of the court. Perfectly true.\r\nBut--Axel had himself stated that he had only carried the body from\r\none grave and laid it in the other. And there could be no doubt but\r\nthat a woman was better able to wrap up a child than was a man--and\r\nwho best of all? Surely a mother\'s tender hand?\r\n\r\nThe presiding justice nods.\r\n\r\nIn any case--could not this girl--if she had been of another\r\nsort--have buried the child naked? One might even go so far as to say\r\nthat she might have thrown it into a dustbin. She might have left it\r\nout under a tree in the open, to freeze to death--that is to say, of\r\ncourse, if it had not been dead already. She might have put it in the\r\noven when left alone, and burnt it up. She might have taken it up to\r\nthe river at Sellanraa and thrown it in there. But this mother did\r\nnone of these things; she wrapped the dead child neatly in a cloth\r\nand buried it. And if the body had been found wrapped neatly when the\r\ngrave was opened, it must be a woman and not a man who had so wrapped\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAnd now, the advocate for the defence went on, it lay with the court\r\nto determine what measure of guilt could properly be attributed to the\r\ngirl Barbro in the matter. There was but little remaining for which\r\nshe could be blamed at all--indeed, in his, counsel\'s, opinion, there\r\nwas nothing. Unless the court found reason to convict on the charge\r\nof having failed to notify the death. But here, again--the child was\r\ndead, and nothing could alter that; the place was far out in the\r\nwilds, many miles from either priest or Lensmand; natural enough,\r\nsurely, to let it sleep the eternal sleep in a neat grave in the\r\nwoods. And if it were a crime to have buried it thus, then the accused\r\nwas not more guilty than the father of the child--as it was, the\r\nmisdemeanour was surely slight enough to be overlooked. Modern\r\npractice was growing more and more disposed to lay more stress\r\non reforming the criminal than on punishing the crime. It was an\r\nantiquated system which sought to inflict punishment for every mortal\r\nthing--it was the _lex talionis_ of the Old Testament, an eye for an\r\neye and a tooth for a tooth. There was no longer the spirit of the law\r\nin modern times. The law of the present day was more humane, seeking\r\nto adjust itself according to the degree of criminal intent and\r\npurpose displayed in each case.\r\n\r\nNo! The court could never convict this girl. It was not the object of\r\na trial to secure an addition to the number of criminals, but rather\r\nto restore to society a good and useful member. It should be noted\r\nthat the accused had now the prospect of a new position where she\r\nwould be under the best possible supervision. Fru Lensmand Heyerdahl\r\nhad, from her intimate knowledge of the girl, and from her own\r\nvaluable experience as a mother, thrown wide the doors of her own home\r\nto the girl; the court would bear in mind the weight of responsibility\r\nattaching to its decision here, and would then convict or acquit the\r\naccused. Finally, he wished to express his thanks to the learned\r\ncounsel for the prosecution, who had generously refrained from\r\ndemanding a conviction--a pleasing evidence of deep and humane\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nThe advocate for the defence sat down.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the proceedings did not take long. The summing up was\r\nbut a repetition of the same points, as viewed from opposite sides, a\r\nbrief synopsis of the action of the play, dry, dull, and dignified. It\r\nhad all been managed very satisfactorily all round; both the advocates\r\nhad pointed out what the court should consider, and the presiding\r\njustice found his task easy enough.\r\n\r\nLights were lit, a couple of lamps hanging from the ceiling--a\r\nmiserable light it was, the justice could hardly see to read his\r\nnotes. He mentioned with some severity the point that the child\'s\r\ndeath had not been duly notified to the proper authorities--but that,\r\nunder the circumstances, should be considered rather the duty of the\r\nfather than of the mother, owing to her weakness at the time. The\r\ncourt had then to determine whether any case had been proved with\r\nregard to concealment of birth and infanticide. Here the evidence\r\nwas again recapitulated from beginning to end. Then came the usual\r\ninjunction as to being duly conscious of responsibility, which the\r\ncourt had heard before, and finally, the not uncommon reminder that in\r\ncases of doubt, the scale should be allowed to turn in favour of the\r\naccused.\r\n\r\nAnd now all was clear and ready.\r\n\r\nThe judges left the room and went into another apartment. They were to\r\nconsider a paper with certain questions, which one of them had with\r\nhim. They were away five minutes, and returned with a "No" to all the\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nNo, the girl Barbro had not killed her child.\r\n\r\nThen the presiding judge said a few more words, and declared that the\r\ngirl Barbro was now free.\r\n\r\nThe court-house emptied, the comedy was over....\r\n\r\nSomeone takes Axel Stroem by the arm: it is Geissler. "H\'m," said he,\r\n"so you\'re done with that now!"\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Axel.\r\n\r\n"But they\'ve wasted a lot of your time to no purpose."\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Axel again. But he was coming to himself again gradually,\r\nand after a moment he added: "None the less, I\'m glad it was no\r\nworse."\r\n\r\n"No worse?" said Geissler. "I\'d have liked to see them try!" He spoke\r\nwith emphasis, and Axel fancied Geissler must have had something to do\r\nwith the case himself; that he had intervened. Heaven knows if,\r\nafter all, it had not been Geissler himself that had led the whole\r\nproceedings and gained the result he wished. It was a mystery, anyway.\r\n\r\nSo much at least Axel understood, that Geissler had been on his side\r\nall through.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve a deal to thank you for," said he, offering his hand.\r\n\r\n"What for?" asked Geissler.\r\n\r\n"Why, for--for all this."\r\n\r\nGeissler turned it off shortly. "I\'ve done nothing at all. Didn\'t\r\ntrouble to do, anything--\'twasn\'t worth while." But for all that,\r\nGeissler was not displeased, maybe, at being thanked; it was as if he\r\nhad been waiting for it, and now it had come. "I\'ve no time to stand\r\ntalking now," he said. "Going back tomorrow, are you? Good. Good-bye,\r\nthen, and good luck to you." And Geissler strolled off across the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the boat going home, Axel encountered the Lensmand and his wife,\r\nBarbro and the two girls called as witnesses.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Fru Heyerdahl, "aren\'t you glad it turned out so well?"\r\n\r\nAxel said, "Yes"; he was glad it had come out all right in the end.\r\n\r\nThe Lensmand himself put in a word, and said: "This is the second\r\nof these cases I\'ve had while I\'ve been here--first with Inger from\r\nSellanraa, and now this. No, it\'s no good trying to countenance that\r\nsort of thing--justice must take its course."\r\n\r\nBut Fru Heyerdahl guessed, no doubt, that Axel was not over pleased\r\nwith her speech of the day before, and tried to smooth it over, to\r\nmake up for it somehow now. "You understood, of course, why I had to\r\nsay all that about you yesterday?"\r\n\r\n"H\'m--ye--es," said Axel.\r\n\r\n"You understood, of course, I know. You didn\'t think I wanted to make\r\nthings harder for you in any way. I\'ve always thought well of you, and\r\nI don\'t mind saying so."\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Axel, no more. But he was pleased and touched at her words.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I mean it," said Fru Heyerdahl. "But I was obliged to try and\r\nshift the blame a little your way, otherwise Barbro would have been\r\nconvicted, and you too. It was all for the best, indeed it was."\r\n\r\n"I thank you kindly," said Axel.\r\n\r\n"And it was I and no other that went about from one to another through\r\nthe place, trying to do what I could for you both. And you saw, of\r\ncourse, that we all had to do the same thing--make out that you were\r\npartly to blame, so as to get you both off in the end."\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Axel.\r\n\r\n"Surely you didn\'t imagine for a moment that I meant any harm to you?\r\nWhen I\'ve always thought so well of you!"\r\n\r\nAy, this was good to hear after all the disgrace of it. Axel, at any\r\nrate, was so touched that he felt he must do something, give Fru\r\nHeyerdahl something or other, whatever he could find--a piece of meat\r\nperhaps, now autumn was come. He had a young bull....\r\n\r\nFru Lensmand Heyerdahl kept her word; she took Barbro to live with\r\nher. On board the steamer, too, she looked after the girl, and saw\r\nthat she was not cold, nor hungry; took care, also, that she did not\r\nget up to any nonsense with the mate from Bergen. The first time it\r\noccurred, she said nothing, but simply called Barbro to her. But a\r\nlittle while after there was Barbro with him again, her head on one\r\nside, talking Bergen dialect and smiling. Then her mistress called her\r\nup and said: "Really, Barbro, you ought not to be going on like that\r\namong the men now. Remember what you\'ve just been through, and what\r\nyou\'ve come from."\r\n\r\n"I was only talking to him a minute," said Barbro. "I could hear he\r\nwas from Bergen."\r\n\r\nAxel did not speak to her. He noticed that she was pale and\r\nclear-skinned now, and her teeth were better. She did not wear either\r\nof his rings....\r\n\r\nAnd now here is Axel tramping up to his own place once more. Wind and\r\nrain, but he is glad at heart; a mowing-machine and a harrow down at\r\nthe quay; he had seen them. Oh, that Geissler! Never a word had he\r\nsaid in town about what he had sent. Ay, an unfathomable man was\r\nGeissler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAxel had no long time to rest at home, as it turned out; the autumn\r\ngales led to fresh trouble and bothersome work that he had brought\r\nupon himself: the telegraph apparatus on his wall announced that the\r\nline was out of order.\r\n\r\nOh, but he had been thinking overmuch of the money, surely, when he\r\ntook on that post. It had been a nuisance from the start. Brede Olsen\r\nhad fairly threatened him when he went down to fetch the apparatus\r\nand tools; ay, had said to him in as many words: "You don\'t seem like\r\nremembering how I saved your life last winter!"\r\n\r\n"\'Twas Oline saved my life," answered Axel.\r\n\r\n"Ho, indeed! And didn\'t I carry you down myself on my own poor\r\nshoulders? Anyway, you were clever enough to buy up my place in\r\nsummer-time and leave me homeless in the winter." Ay, Brede was deeply\r\noffended; he went on:\r\n\r\n"But you can take the telegraph for me, ay, all the rubble of it for\r\nme. I and mine we\'ll go down to the village and start on something\r\nthere--you don\'t know what it\'ll be, but wait and see. What about a\r\nhotel place where folk can get coffee? You see but we\'ll manage all\r\nright. There\'s my wife can sell things to eat and drink as well as\r\nanother, and I can go out on business and make a heap more than you\r\never did. But I don\'t mind telling you, Axel, I could make things\r\nawkward for you in many odd ways, seeing all I know about the\r\ntelegraph and things; ay, \'twould be easy enough both to pull down\r\npoles and cut the line and all. And then you to go running out after\r\nit midway in the busy time. That\'s all I\'ll say to you, Axel, and you\r\nbear it in mind...."\r\n\r\nNow Axel should have been down and brought up the machines from the\r\nquay--all over gilt and colouring they were, like pictures to see. And\r\nhe might have had them to look at all that day, and learn the manner\r\nof using them--but now they must wait. \'Twas none so pleasant to have\r\nto put aside all manner of necessary work to run and see after a\r\ntelegraph line. But \'twas the money....\r\n\r\nUp on the top of the hill he meets Aronsen. Ay, Aronsen the trader\r\nstanding there looking and gazing out into the storm, like a vision\r\nhimself. What did he want there? No peace in his mind now, it seems,\r\nbut he must go up the fjeld himself and look at the mine with his own\r\neyes. And this, look you, Trader Aronsen had done from sheer earnest\r\nthought of his own and his family\'s future. Here he is, face to face\r\nwith bare desolation on the forsaken hills, machines lying there to\r\nrust, carts and material of all sorts left out in the open--\'twas\r\ndismal to see. Here and there on the walls of the huts were placards,\r\nnotices written by hand, forbidding any one to damage or remove the\r\ncompany\'s property--tools, carts, or buildings.\r\n\r\nAxel stops for a few words with the mad trader, and asks if he has\r\ncome out shooting.\r\n\r\n"Shooting? Ay, if I could only get within reach of him!"\r\n\r\n"Him? Who, then?"\r\n\r\n"Why, him that\'s ruining me and all the rest of us hereabout. Him that\r\nwon\'t sell his bit of fjeld and let things get to work again, and\r\ntrade and money passing same as before."\r\n\r\n"D\'you mean him Geissler, then?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, \'tis him I mean. Ought to be shot!"\r\n\r\nAxel laughs at this, and says: "Geissler he was in town but a few days\r\nback; you should have talked to him there. But if I might be so bold\r\nas to say, I doubt you\'d better leave him alone, after all."\r\n\r\n"And why?" asks Aron angrily.\r\n\r\n"Why? I\'ve a mind he\'d be overwise and mysterious for you in the end."\r\n\r\nThey argued over this for a while, and Aronsen grew more excited than\r\never. At last Axel asked jestingly: "Well, anyway, you\'ll not be so\r\nhard on us all to run away and leave us to ourselves in the wilds?"\r\n\r\n"Huh! Think I\'m going to stay fooling about here in your bogs and\r\nnever so much as making the price of a pipe?" cried Aron indignantly.\r\n"Find me a buyer and I\'ll sell out."\r\n\r\n"Sell out?" says Axel. "The land\'s good ordinary land if she\'s handled\r\nas should be--and what you\'ve got\'s enough to keep a man."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t I just said I\'ll not touch it?" cried Aronsen again in the\r\ngale. "I can do better than that!"\r\n\r\nAxel thought if that was so, \'twould be easy to find a buyer; but\r\nAronsen laughed scornfully at the idea--there was nobody there in the\r\nwilds had money to buy him out.\r\n\r\n"Not here in the wilds, maybe, but elsewhere."\r\n\r\n"Here\'s naught but filth and poverty," said Aron bitterly.\r\n\r\n"Why, that\'s as it may be," said Axel in some offence. "But Isak up at\r\nSellanraa he could buy you out any day."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t believe it," said Aronsen.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis all one to me what you believe," said Axel, and turned to go.\r\n\r\nAronsen called after him: "Hi, wait a bit! What\'s that you say--Isak\r\nmight take the place, was that what you said?"\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Axel, "if \'twas only the money. He\'s means enough to buy up\r\nfive of your Storborg and all!"\r\n\r\nAronsen had gone round keeping wide of Sellanraa on his way up, taking\r\ncare not to be seen; but, going back, he called in and had a talk with\r\nIsak. But Isak only shook his head and said nay, \'twas a matter he\'d\r\nnever thought of, and didn\'t care to.\r\n\r\nBut when Eleseus came back home that Christmas, Isak was easier to\r\ndeal with. True, he maintained that it was a mad idea to think of\r\nbuying Storborg, \'twas nothing had ever been in his mind; still, if\r\nEleseus thought he could do anything with the place, why, they might\r\nthink it over.\r\n\r\nEleseus himself was midways between, as it were; not exactly eager\r\nfor it, yet not altogether indifferent. If he did settle down here at\r\nhome, then his career in one way was at an end. \'Twas not like being\r\nin a town. That autumn, when a lot of people from his parts had been\r\nup for cross-examination in a certain place, he had taken care not to\r\nshow himself; he had no desire to meet any that knew him from that\r\nquarter; they belonged to another world. And was he now to go back to\r\nthat same world himself?\r\n\r\nHis mother was all for buying the place; Sivert, too, said it would be\r\nbest. They stuck to Eleseus both of them, and one day the three drove\r\ndown to Storborg to see the wonder with their own eyes.\r\n\r\nBut once there was a prospect of selling, Aronsen became a different\r\nman; he wasn\'t pressed to get rid of it, not at all. If he did go\r\naway, the place could stand as it was; \'twas a first-rate holding, a\r\n"cash down" place, there\'d be no difficulty in selling it any time.\r\n"You\'d not give my price," said Aronsen.\r\n\r\nThey went over the house and stores, the warehouse and sheds,\r\ninspected the miserable remains of the stock, consisting of a few\r\nmouth-organs, watch-chains, boxes of coloured papers, lamps with\r\nhanging ornaments, all utterly unsaleable to sensible folks that lived\r\non their land. There were a few cases of nails and some cotton print,\r\nand that was all.\r\n\r\nEleseus was constrained to show off a bit, and looked over things with\r\na knowing air. "I\'ve no use for that sort of truck," said he.\r\n\r\n"Why, then, you\'ve no call to buy it," said Aronsen.\r\n\r\n"Anyhow, I\'ll offer you fifteen hundred _Kroner_ for the place as it\r\nstands, with goods, live stock, and the rest," said Eleseus. Oh, he\r\nwas careless, enough; his offer was but a show, for something to say.\r\n\r\nAnd they drove back home. No, there was no deal; Eleseus had made a\r\nridiculous offer, that Aronsen regarded as an insult. "I don\'t think\r\nmuch of you, young man," said Aronsen; ay, calling him young man,\r\nconsidering him but a slip of a lad that had grown conceited in the\r\ntown, and thought to teach him, Aronsen, the value of goods.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll not be called \'young man\' by you, if you please," said Eleseus,\r\noffended in his turn. They must be mortal enemies after that.\r\n\r\nBut how could it be that Aronsen had all along been so independent\r\nand so sure of not being forced to sell? There was a reason for it:\r\nAronsen had a little hope at the back of his mind, after all.\r\n\r\nA meeting had been held in the village to consider the position which\r\nhad arisen owing to Geissler\'s refusal to sell his part of the mining\r\ntract. \'Twas not only the outlying settlers who stood to lose by this,\r\nit would be fatal to the whole district.\r\n\r\nWhy could not folk go on living as well or as poorly now as before\r\nthere had been any mine at all? Well, they could not, and that was\r\nall about it. They had grown accustomed to better food, finer bread,\r\nstore-bought clothes and higher wages, general extravagance--ay, folk\r\nhad learned to reckon with money more, that was the matter. And now\r\nthe money was gone again, had slipped away like a shoal of herring out\r\nto sea--\'twas dire distress for them all, and what was to be done?\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about it: ex-Lensmand Geissler was taking his\r\nrevenge upon the village because they had helped his superior to get\r\nhim dismissed; equally clear was it that they had underestimated him\r\nat the time. He had not simply disappeared and left. By the simplest\r\nmeans, merely by demanding an unreasonable price for a mine, he had\r\nsucceeded in checking the entire development of the district. Ay, a\r\nstrong man! Axel Stroem from Maaneland could bear them out in this; he\r\nwas the one who had last met Geissler. Brede\'s girl Barbro had had a\r\nlawsuit in the town, and come home acquitted; but Geissler, he had\r\nbeen there in court all the time. And if any one suggested that\r\nGeissler was dejected, and a broken man, why, he had only to look at\r\nthe costly machines that same Geissler had sent up as a present to\r\nAxel Stroem.\r\n\r\nThis man it was then, who held the fate of the district in his hand;\r\nthey would have to come to some agreement with him. What price would\r\nGeissler ultimately be disposed to accept for his mine? They must\r\nascertain in any case. The Swedes had offered him twenty-five\r\nthousand--Geissler had refused. But suppose the village here, the\r\ncommune, were to make up the remainder, simply to get things going\r\nagain? If it were not an altogether unheard-of amount, it might be\r\nworth while. Both the trader at the shore station and Aronsen up at\r\nStorborg would be willing to contribute privately and secretly; funds\r\ndevoted to such a purpose now would be repaid in the long run.\r\n\r\nThe end of it was that two men were deputed to call on Geissler and\r\ntake up the matter with him. And they were expected back shortly.\r\n\r\nSo it was, then, that Aronsen cherished a flicker of hope, and thought\r\nhe could afford to stand on his dignity with any who offered to buy up\r\nStorborg. But it was not to last.\r\n\r\nA week later the deputation returned home with a flat refusal. Oh,\r\nthey had done the worst thing possible at the outset, in choosing\r\nBrede Olsen as one of the men they sent--they had taken him as being\r\none who best could spare the time. They had found Geissler, but he had\r\nonly shaken his head and laughed. "Go back home again," he had said.\r\nBut Geissler had paid for their journey back.\r\n\r\nThen the district was to be left to its fate?\r\n\r\nAfter Aronsen had raged for a while, and grown more and more\r\ndesperate, he went up one day to Sellanraa and closed the deal. Ay,\r\nAronsen did. Eleseus got it for the price he had offered; land and\r\nhouse and sheds, live stock and goods, for fifteen hundred _Kroner_.\r\nTrue, on going through the inventory after, it was found that\r\nAronsen\'s wife had converted most of the cotton print to her own use;\r\nbut trifles of that sort were nothing to a man like Eleseus. It didn\'t\r\ndo to be mean, he said.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Eleseus was not exactly delighted with things as they\r\nhad turned out--his future was settled now, he was to bury himself in\r\nthe wilds. He must give up his great plans; he was no longer a young\r\ngentleman in an office, he would never be a Lensmand, not even live in\r\na town at all. To his father and those at home he made it appear that\r\nhe was proud at having secured Storborg at the very price he had\r\nfixed--it would show them he knew what he was about. But that small\r\ntriumph did not go very far. He had also the satisfaction of taking\r\nover Andresen, the chief clerk, who was thus, as it were, included in\r\nthe bargain. Aronsen had no longer any use for him, until he had a new\r\nplace going. It was a pleasant sensation to be Eleseus, when Andresen\r\ncame up begging to be allowed to stay; here it was Eleseus who was\r\nmaster and head of the business--for the first time in his life.\r\n\r\n"You can stay, yes," he said. "I shall be wanting an assistant to look\r\nafter the place when I\'m away on business--opening up connections in\r\nBergen and Trondhjem," said he.\r\n\r\nAnd Andresen was no bad man to have, as it soon proved; he was a good\r\nworker, and looked after things well when Eleseus was away. \'Twas\r\nonly at first he had been somewhat inclined to show and play the\r\nfine gentleman, and that was the fault of his master Aronsen. It was\r\ndifferent now. In the spring, when the bogs were thawed some depth,\r\nSivert came down from Sellanraa to Storborg, to start a bit of\r\nditching for his brother, and lo, Andresen himself went out on the\r\nland digging too. Heaven knows what possessed him to do it, for \'twas\r\nno work of his, but that was the sort of man he was. It was not thawed\r\ndeep enough yet, and they could not get as far as they wanted by a\r\nlong way, but it was something done, at any rate. It was Isak\'s old\r\nidea to drain the bogs at Storborg and till the land there properly;\r\nthe bit of a store was only to be an extra, a convenience, to save\r\nfolk going all the way down to the village for a reel of thread.\r\n\r\nSo Sivert and Andresen stood there digging, and talking now and again\r\nwhen they stopped for a rest. Andresen had also somehow or other\r\nmanaged to get hold of a gold piece, a twenty-_Krone_ piece, and\r\nSivert would gladly have had the bright thing himself; but Andresen\r\nwould not part with it--kept it wrapped up in tissue paper in his\r\nchest. Sivert proposed a wrestling match for the money--see who could\r\nthrow the other; but Andresen would not risk it. Sivert offered to\r\nstake twenty _Kroner_ in notes against the gold piece, and do all the\r\ndigging himself into the bargain if he won; but Andresen took offence\r\nat that. "Ho," said he, "and you\'d like to go back home, no doubt, and\r\nsay I\'m no good at working on the land!" At last they agreed to set\r\ntwenty-five _Kroner_ in notes against the gold twenty-_Krone_ piece,\r\nand Sivert slipped home to Sellanraa that night to ask his father for\r\nthe money.\r\n\r\nA young man\'s trick, the pretty play of youth! A night\'s sleep thrown\r\naway, to walk miles up and miles down again, and work next day as\r\nusual--\'twas nothing to a young man in his strength, and a bright gold\r\npiece was worth it all. Andresen was a little inclined to make fun of\r\nhim over the deal, but Sivert was not at a loss; he had only to let\r\nfall a word of Leopoldine. "There! I was nearly forgetting. Leopoldine\r\nshe asked after you...." And Andresen stopped his work of a sudden and\r\nwent very red.\r\n\r\nPleasant days for them both, draining and ditching, getting up long\r\narguments for fun, and working, and arguing again. Now and then\r\nEleseus would come out and lend a hand, but he soon tired. Eleseus was\r\nnot strong either of body or will, but a thorough good fellow for all\r\nthat....\r\n\r\n"Here\'s that Oline coming along," Sivert the jester would say. "Now\r\nyou\'ll have to go in and sell her a paper of coffee." And Eleseus was\r\nglad enough to go. Selling Oline some trifle or other meant so many\r\nminutes\' rest from throwing heavy clods.\r\n\r\nAnd Oline, poor creature, she might well be needing a pinch of coffee\r\nnow and again, whether by chance she managed to get the money from\r\nAxel to pay for it, or bartered a goats\' milk cheese in exchange.\r\nOline was not altogether what she had been; the work at Maaneland was\r\ntoo hard for her; she was an old woman now, and it was leaving its\r\nmark. Not that she ever confessed to any weakness or ageing herself;\r\nho! she would have found plenty to say if she had been dismissed.\r\nTough and irrepressible was Oline; did her work, and found time to\r\nwander over to neighbours here or there for a real good gossip. \'Twas\r\nher plain right, and there was little gossiping at Maaneland. Axel\r\nhimself was not given that way.\r\n\r\nAs for that Barbro case, Oline was displeased, ay, disappointed was\r\nOline. Both of them acquitted! That Brede\'s girl Barbro should be let\r\noff when Inger Sellanraa had got eight years was not to Oline\'s taste\r\nat all; she felt an unchristian annoyance at such favouritism. But the\r\nAlmighty would look to things, no doubt, in His own good time! And\r\nOline nodded, as if prophesying divine retribution at a later date.\r\nNaturally, also, Oline made no secret of her dissatisfaction with the\r\nfinding of the court, more especially when she happened to fall out\r\nwith her master, Axel, over any little trifle. Then she would deliver\r\nherself, in the old soft-spoken way, of much deep and bitter sarcasm.\r\n"Ay, \'tis strange how the law\'s changed these days, for all the\r\nwickedness of Sodom and Gomorrah; but the word of the Lord\'s my guide,\r\nas ever was, and a blessed refuge for the meek."\r\n\r\nOh, Axel was sick and tired of his housekeeper now, and wished her\r\nanywhere. And now with spring coming again, and all the season\'s work\r\nto do alone; haymaking to come, and what was he to do? \'Twas a poor\r\nlook-out. His brother\'s wife, at Breidablik had written home to\r\nHelgeland trying to find a decent woman to help him, but nothing had\r\ncome of it as yet. And in any case, it would mean his having to pay\r\nfor the journey.\r\n\r\nNay, \'twas a mean and wicked trick of Barbro to make away with the bit\r\nof a child and then run off herself. A summer and two winters now he\r\nhad been forced to make do with Oline, and no saying how much longer\r\nit might be yet. And Barbro, the creature, did she care? He had had a\r\nfew words with her down in the village one day that winter, but never\r\na tear had trickled slowly from her eyes to freeze on her cheek.\r\n\r\n"What you\'ve done with rings I gave you?" asks he.\r\n\r\n"Rings?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, the rings."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t got them now."\r\n\r\n"Ho, so you haven\'t got them now?"\r\n\r\n"\'Twas all over between us," said she. "And I couldn\'t wear them after\r\nthat. \'Tis not the way to go on wearing rings when it\'s all over\r\nbetween you."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'d just like to know what you\'ve done with them, that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"Wanted me to give them back, maybe," said she. "Well, I never thought\r\nyou\'d have had me put you to that shame."\r\n\r\nAxel thought for a moment, and said: "I could have made it up to you\r\nother ways. That you shouldn\'t lose by it, I mean."\r\n\r\nBut no, Barbro had got rid of the rings, and never so much as gave\r\nhim the chance of buying back a gold ring and a silver ring at a\r\nreasonable price.\r\n\r\nFor all that, Barbro was not so thoroughly harsh and unlovable,\r\nthat she was not. She had a long apron thing that fastened over the\r\nshoulders and with tucks at the edge, and a strip of white stuff up\r\nround her neck--ay, she looked well. There were some said she\'d found\r\na lad already down in the village to go sweethearting with, though\r\nmaybe \'twas but their talk, after all. Fru Heyerdahl kept a watchful\r\neye on her at any rate, and took care not to let her go to the\r\nChristmas dances.\r\n\r\nAy, Fru Heyerdahl was careful enough, that she was; here was Axel\r\nstanding talking to his former servant-girl about a matter of two\r\nrings, and suddenly Fru Heyerdahl comes right between them and says:\r\n"Barbro, I thought you were going to the store?" Off goes Barbro. And\r\nher mistress turns to Axel and says: "Have you come down with some\r\nmeat, or something?"\r\n\r\n"H\'m," said Axel, just that, and touched his cap.\r\n\r\nNow it was Fru Heyerdahl that had praised him up so that last autumn,\r\nsaying he was a splendid fellow and she had always thought well of\r\nhim; and one good turn was worth another, no doubt. Axel knew the way\r\nof doing things; \'twas an old story, when simple folk had dealing with\r\ntheir betters, with authority. And he had thought at once of a piece\r\nof butcher\'s meat, a bull he had, that might be useful there. But time\r\nwent on, and month and month passed by and autumn was gone, and the\r\nbull was never killed. And what harm could it do, after all, if he\r\nkept it for himself?--give it away, and he would be so much poorer.\r\nAnd \'twas a fine beast, anyway.\r\n\r\n"H\'m, _Goddag_. Nay," said Axel, shaking his head; he\'d no meat with\r\nhim today.\r\n\r\nBut Fru Heyerdahl seemed to be guessing his thoughts, for she said:\r\n"I\'ve heard you\'ve an ox, or what?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, so I have," said Axel.\r\n\r\n"Are you going to keep it?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, I\'ll be keeping him yet."\r\n\r\n"I see. You\'ve no sheep to be killed?"\r\n\r\n"Not now I haven\'t. \'Tis this way, I\'ve never had but what\'s to be\r\nkept on the place."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I see," said Fru Heyerdahl; "well, that was all." And she went on\r\nher way.\r\n\r\nAxel drove up homeward, but he could not help thinking somewhat of\r\nwhat had passed; he rather feared he had made a false step somehow.\r\nThe Lensmand\'s lady had been an important witness once; for and\r\nagainst him, but important anyway. He had been through an unpleasant\r\ntime on that occasion, but, after all, he had got out of it in the\r\nend--got out of a very awkward business in connection with the body of\r\na child found buried on his land. Perhaps, after all, he had better\r\nkill that sheep.\r\n\r\nAnd, strangely enough, this thought was somehow connected with Barbro.\r\nIf he came down bringing sheep for her mistress it could hardly fail\r\nto make a certain impression on Barbro herself.\r\n\r\nBut again the days went on, and nothing evil happened for their going\r\non. Next time he drove; down to the village he had no sheep on his\r\ncart, no, still no sheep. But at the last moment he had taken a lamb.\r\nA big lamb, though; not a miserable little one by any means, and he\r\ndelivered it with these words:\r\n\r\n"\'Tis rare tough meat on a wether, and no sort of a gift to bring. But\r\nthis is none so bad."\r\n\r\nBut Fru Heyerdahl would not hear of taking it as a gift. "Say what you\r\nwant for it," she said. Oh, a fine lady, \'twas not her way to take\r\ngifts from folk! And the end of it was that Axel got a good price for\r\nhis lamb.\r\n\r\nHe saw nothing of Barbro at all. Lensmand\'s lady had seen him coming,\r\nand got her out of the way. And good luck go with her--Barbro that had\r\ncheated him out of his help for a year and a half!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX\r\n\r\n\r\nThat spring something unexpected happened--something of importance\r\nindeed; work at the mine was started again; Geissler had sold his\r\nland. Inconceivable! Oh, but Geissler was an unfathomable mind; he\r\ncould make a bargain or refuse, shake his head for a "No," or nod the\r\nsame for "Yes." Could make the whole village smile again.\r\n\r\nConscience had pricked him, maybe; he had no longer the heart to see\r\nthe district where he had been Lensmand famishing on home-made gruel\r\nand short of money. Or had he got his quarter of a million? Possibly,\r\nagain, Geissler himself had at last begun to feel the need of money,\r\nand had been forced to sell for what he could get. Twenty-five or\r\nfifty thousand was not to be despised, after all. As a matter of fact,\r\nthere were rumours that it was his eldest son who had settled the\r\nbusiness on his father\'s account.\r\n\r\nBe that as it might, work was recommenced; the same engineer came\r\nagain with his gangs of men, and the work went on anew. The same work,\r\nay, but in a different fashion now, going backwards, as it were.\r\n\r\nAll seemed in regular order: the Swedish mine-owners had brought their\r\nmen, and dynamite and money--what could be wrong, anyway? Even Aronsen\r\ncame back again, Aronsen the trader, who had set his mind on buying\r\nback Storborg from Eleseus.\r\n\r\n"No," said Eleseus. "It\'s not for sale."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll sell, I suppose, if you\'re offered enough?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\nNo, Eleseus was not going to sell Storborg. The truth was, he had\r\nchanged his mind somewhat as to the position; it was none so bad,\r\nafter all, to be owner of a trading station in the hills; he had a\r\nfine verandah with coloured glass windows, and a chief clerk to do\r\nall the work, while he himself went about the country travelling. Ay,\r\ntravelling first class, with fine folks. One day, perhaps, he might\r\nbe able to go as far as America--he often thought of that. Even these\r\nlittle journeys on business to the towns down in the south were\r\nsomething to live on for a long time after. Not that he let himself go\r\naltogether, and chartered a steamer of his own and held wild orgies on\r\nthe way--orgies were not in his line. A strange fellow, was Eleseus;\r\nhe no longer cared about girls, had given up such things altogether,\r\nlost all interest in them. No, but after all, he was the Margrave\'s\r\nson, and travelled first class and bought up loads of goods. And each\r\ntime he came back a little finer than before, a greater man; the last\r\ntime, he even wore galoshes to keep his feet dry. "What\'s that--you\r\ntaken to wearing two pairs of shoes?" they said.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been suffering from chilblains lately," says Eleseus.\r\n\r\nAnd every one sympathized with Eleseus and his chilblains.\r\n\r\nGlorious days--a grand life, with no end of leisure. No, he was not\r\ngoing to sell Storborg. What, go back to a little town and stand\r\nbehind the counter in a little shop, and no chief clerk of his own at\r\nall? Moreover, he had made up his mind now to develop the business\r\non a grand scale. The Swedes had come back again and would flood the\r\nplace with money; he would be a fool to sell out now. Aronsen was\r\nforced to go back each time with a flat refusal, more and more\r\ndisgusted at his own lack of foresight in ever having given up the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nOh, but Aronsen might have saved himself a deal of self-reproach, and\r\nlikewise Eleseus with his plans and intentions, that he might have\r\nkept in moderation. And more than all, the village would have done\r\nwell to be less confident, instead of going about smiling and rubbing\r\nits hands like angels sure of being blessed--no call for them to do so\r\nif they had but known. For now came disappointment, and no little one\r\nat that. Who would ever have thought it; work at the mine commenced\r\nagain, true enough--but at the other end of the fjeld, eight miles\r\naway, on the southern boundary of Geissler\'s holding, far off in\r\nanother district altogether, a district with which they were in no\r\nway concerned. And from there the work was to make its way gradually\r\nnorthward to the original mine, Isak\'s mine, to be a blessing to folk\r\nin the wilds and in the village. At best, it would take years, any\r\nnumber of years, a generation.\r\n\r\nThe news came like a dynamite charge of the heaviest sort, with shock\r\nand stopping of ears. The village folk were overcome with grief. Some\r\nblamed Geissler; \'twas Geissler, that devil of a man, who had tricked\r\nthem once more. Others huddled together at a meeting and sent out a\r\nnew deputation of trusty men, this time to the mining company, to the\r\nengineer. But nothing came of it; the engineer explained that he was\r\nobliged to start work from the south because that was nearest the sea,\r\nand saved the need of an aerial railway, reduced the transport almost\r\nto nil. No, the work must begin that way; no more to be said.\r\n\r\nThen it was that Aronsen at once rose up and set out for the new\r\nworkings, the new promised land. He even tried to get Andresen to go\r\nwith him: "What\'s the sense of you staying on here in the wilds?"\r\nsaid he. "Much better come with me." But Andresen would not leave;\r\nincomprehensible, but so it was, there was something which held him\r\nto the spot; he seemed to thrive there, had taken root. It must be\r\nAndresen who had changed, for the place was the same as ever. Folk\r\nand things were unaltered; the mining work had turned away to other\r\ntracts, but folk in the wilds had not lost their heads over that; they\r\nhad their land to till, their crops, their cattle. No great wealth in\r\nmoney, true, but in all the necessaries of life, ay, absolutely all.\r\n\r\nEven Eleseus was not reduced to misery because the stream of gold was\r\nflowing elsewhere; the worst of it was that in his first exaltation he\r\nhad bought great stocks of goods that were now unsaleable. Well, they\r\ncould stay there for the time being; it looked well, at any rate, to\r\nhave plenty of wares in a store.\r\n\r\nNo, a man of the wilds did not lose his head. The air was not less\r\nhealthy now than before; there were folk enough to admire new clothes;\r\nthere was no need of diamonds. Wine was a thing he knew from the feast\r\nat Cana. A man of the wild was not put out by the thought of great\r\nthings he could not get; art, newspapers, luxuries, politics, and\r\nsuch-like were worth just what folk were willing to pay for them,\r\nno more. Growth of the soil was something different, a thing to be\r\nprocured at any cost; the only source, the origin of all. A dull and\r\ndesolate existence? Nay, least of all. A man had everything; his\r\npowers above, his dreams, his loves, his wealth of superstition.\r\nSivert, walking one evening by the river, stops on a sudden; there on\r\nthe water are a pair of ducks, male and female. They have sighted him;\r\nthey are aware of man, and afraid; one of them says something, utters\r\na little sound, a melody in three tones, and the other answers\r\nwith the same. Then they rise, whirl off like two little wheels a\r\nstone\'s-throw up the river, and settle again. Then, as before, one\r\nspeaks and the other answers; the same speech as at first, but mark a\r\nnew delight: _it is set two octaves higher_! Sivert stands looking at\r\nthe birds, looking past them, far into a dream.\r\n\r\nA sound had floated through him, a sweetness, and left him standing\r\nthere with a delicate; thin recollection of something wild and\r\nsplendid, something he had known before, and forgotten again. He walks\r\nhome in silence, says no word of it, makes no boast of it, \'twas not\r\nfor worldly speech. And it was but Sivert from Sellanraa, went out one\r\nevening, young and ordinary as he was, and met with this.\r\n\r\nIt was not the only thing he met with--there were more adventures\r\nbeside. Another thing which happened was that Jensine left Sellanraa.\r\nAnd that made Sivert not a little perturbed in his mind.\r\n\r\nAy, it came to that: Jensine would leave, if you please; she wished it\r\nso. Oh, Jensine was not one of your common sort, none could say that.\r\nSivert had once offered to drive her back home at once, and on that\r\noccasion she had cried, which was a pity; but afterwards she repented\r\nof that, and made it clear that she repented, and gave notice and\r\nwould leave. Ay, a proper way to do.\r\n\r\nNothing could have suited Inger at Sellanraa better than this; Inger\r\nwas beginning to grow dissatisfied with her maid. Strange; she had\r\nnothing to say against her, but the sight of the girl annoyed her,\r\nshe could hardly endure to have her about the place. It all arose, no\r\ndoubt, from Inger\'s state of mind; she had been heavy and religious\r\nall that winter, and it would not pass off. "Want to leave, do\r\nyou? Why, then, well and good," said Inger. It was a blessing, the\r\nfulfilment of nightly prayers. Two grown women they were already, what\r\ndid they want with this Jensine, fresh as could be and marriageable\r\nand all? Inger thought with a certain displeasure of that same\r\nmarriageableness, thinking, maybe, how she had once been the same\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nHer deep religiousness did not pass off. She was not full of vice; she\r\nhad tasted, sipped, let us say, but \'twas not her intent to persevere\r\nin that way all through her old age, not by any means; Inger turned\r\naside with horror from the thought. The mine and all its workmen were\r\nno longer there--and Heaven be praised. Virtue was not only tolerable,\r\nbut inevitable, it was a necessary thing; ay, a necessary good, a\r\nspecial grace.\r\n\r\nBut the world was all awry. Look now, here was Leopoldine, little\r\nLeopoldine, a seedling, a slip of a child, going about bursting\r\nwith sinful health; but an arm round her waist and she would fall\r\nhelpless--oh, fie! There were spots on her face now, too--a sign in\r\nitself of wild blood; ay, her mother remembered well enough, \'twas the\r\nwild blood would out. Inger did not condemn her child for a matter of\r\nspots \'on her face; but it must stop, she would have an end of it. And\r\nwhat did that fellow Andresen want coming up to Sellanraa of Sundays,\r\nto talk fieldwork with Isak? Did the two menfolk imagine the child was\r\nblind? Ay, young folk were young folk as they had ever been, thirty,\r\nforty years ago, but worse than ever now.\r\n\r\n"Why, that\'s as it may be," said Isak, when they spoke of the matter.\r\n"But here\'s the spring come, and Jensine gone, and who\'s to manage the\r\nsummer work?"\r\n\r\n"Leopoldine and I can do the haymaking," said Inger. "Ay, I\'d rather\r\ngo raking night and day myself," said she bitterly, and on the point\r\nof crying.\r\n\r\nIsak could not understand what there was to make such a fuss about;\r\nbut he had his own ideas, no doubt, and off he went to the edge of\r\nthe wood, with crowbar and pick, and fell to working at a stone. Nay,\r\nindeed, Isak could not see why Jensine should have left them; a good\r\ngirl, and a worker. To tell the truth, Isak was often at a loss in all\r\nsave the simplest things--his work, his lawful and natural doings. A\r\nbroad-shouldered man, well filled out, nothing astral about him at\r\nall; he ate like a man and throve on it, and \'twas rarely he was\r\nthrown off his balance in any way.\r\n\r\nWell, here was this stone. There were stones more in plenty, but here\r\nwas one to begin with. Isak is looking ahead, to the time when he\r\nwill need to build a little house here, a little home for himself and\r\nInger, and as well to get to work a bit on the site, and clear it,\r\nwhile Sivert is down at Storborg. Otherwise the boy would be asking\r\nquestions, and that was not to Isak\'s mind. The day must come,\r\nof course, when Sivert would need all there was of the place for\r\nhimself--the old folks would be wanting a house apart. Ay, there was\r\nnever an end of building at Sellanraa; that fodder loft above the\r\ncowshed was not done yet, though the beams and planks for it were\r\nthere all ready.\r\n\r\nWell, then, here was this stone. Nothing so big to look at above\r\nground, but not to be moved at a touch for all that; it must be a\r\nheavy fellow. Isak dug round about it, and tried his crowbar, but it\r\nwould not move. He dug again and tried once more, but no. Back to the\r\nhouse for a spade then, and clear the earth away, then digging\r\nagain, trying again--no. A mighty heavy beast to shift, thought Isak\r\npatiently enough. He dug away now for a steady while, but the stone\r\nseemed reaching ever deeper and deeper down, there was no getting a\r\npurchase on it. A nuisance it would be if he had to blast it, after\r\nall. The boring would make such a noise, and call up every one on the\r\nplace. He dug. Off again to fetch a levering pole and tried that--no.\r\nHe dug again. Isak was beginning to be annoyed with this stone; he\r\nfrowned, and looked at the thing, as if he had just come along to make\r\na general inspection of the stones in that neighbourhood, and\r\nfound this one particularly stupid. He criticized it; ay, it was a\r\nround-faced, idiotic stone, no getting hold of it any way--he was\r\nalmost inclined to say it was deformed. Blasting? The thing wasn\'t\r\nworth a charge of powder. And was he to give it up, was he to consider\r\nthe possibility of being beaten by a stone?\r\n\r\nHe dug. Hard work, that it was, but as to giving up ... At last he\r\ngot the nose of his lever down and tried it; the stone did not move.\r\nTechnically speaking, there was nothing wrong with his method, but it\r\ndid not work. What was the matter, then? He had got out stones before\r\nin his life. Was he getting old? Funny thing, he he he! Ridiculous,\r\nindeed. True, he had noticed lately that he was not so strong as he\r\nhad been--that is to say, he had noticed nothing of the sort, never\r\nheeded it; \'twas only imagination. And he goes at the stone once more,\r\nwith the best will in the world.\r\n\r\nOh, \'twas no little matter when Isak bore down on a levering pole\r\nwith all his weight. There he is now, hoisting and hoisting again, a\r\nCyclop, enormous, with a torso that seems built in one to the knees. A\r\ncertain pomp and splendour about him; his equator was astounding.\r\n\r\nBut the stone did not move.\r\n\r\nNo help for it; he must dig again. Try blasting? Not a word! No, dig\r\nagain. He was intent on his work now. The stone should come up! It\r\nwould be wrong to say there was anything at all perverse in this on\r\nIsak\'s part; it was the ingrown love of a worker on the soil,\r\nbut altogether without tenderness. It was a foolish sight; first\r\ngathering, as it were, about the stone from all sides, then making\r\na dash at it, then digging all round its sides and fumbling at it,\r\nthrowing up the earth with his bare hands, ay, so he did. Yet there\r\nwas nothing of a caress in it all. Warmth, yes, but the warmth of zeal\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nTry the lever again? He thrust it down where there was best hold--no.\r\nAn altogether remarkable instance of obstinacy and defiance on the\r\npart of the stone. But it seemed to be giving. Isak tries again, with\r\na touch of hope; the earth-breaker has a feeling now that the stone\r\nis no longer invincible. Then the lever slipped, throwing him to the\r\nground. "Devil!" said he. Ay, he said that. His cap had got thrust\r\ndown over one ear as he fell, making him look like a robber, like a\r\nSpaniard. He spat.\r\n\r\nHere comes Inger. "Isak, come in and have your food now," says she,\r\nkindly and pleasant as can be.\r\n\r\n"Ay," says he, but will have her no nearer, and wants no questions.\r\n\r\nOh, but Inger, never dreaming, she comes nearer.\r\n\r\n"What\'s in your mind now?" she asks, to soften him with a hint of the\r\nway he thinks out some new grand thing almost every day.\r\n\r\nBut Isak is sullen, terribly sullen and stern; he says: "Nay, I don\'t\r\nknow."\r\n\r\nAnd Inger again, foolish that she is--ugh, keeps on talking and asking\r\nand will not go.\r\n\r\n"Seeing as you\'ve seen it yourself," says he at last, "I\'m getting up\r\nthis stone here."\r\n\r\n"Ho, going to get him up?"\r\n\r\n"Ay."\r\n\r\n"And couldn\'t I help a bit at all?" she asks.\r\n\r\nIsak shakes his head. But it was a kindly thought, anyway, that she\r\nwould have helped him, and he can hardly be harsh in return.\r\n\r\n"If you just wait the least bit of a while," says he, and runs home\r\nfor the hammers.\r\n\r\nIf he could only get the stone rough a bit, knocking off a flake or so\r\nin the right spot, it would give the lever a better hold. Inger holds\r\nthe setting-hammer, and Isak strikes. Strikes, strikes. Ay, sure\r\nenough, off goes a flake. "\'Twas a good help," says Isak, "and thanks.\r\nBut don\'t trouble about food for me this bit of a while, I must get\r\nthis stone up first."\r\n\r\nBut Inger does not go. And to tell the truth, Isak is pleased enough\r\nto have her there watching him at his work; \'tis a thing has always\r\npleased him, since their young days. And lo, he gets a fine purchase\r\nnow on the lever, and puts his weight into it--the stone moves! "He\'s\r\nmoving," says Inger.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis but your nonsense," says Isak.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, indeed! But it is!"\r\n\r\nGot so far, then--and that was something. The stone was, so to speak,\r\nconverted now, was on his side; they were working together. Isak\r\nhoists and heaves with his lever, and the stone moves, but no more. He\r\nkeeps at it a while, nothing more. All at once he understands that it\r\nis not merely a question of weight, the dead pull of his body; no, the\r\nfact is that he has no longer his old strength, he has lost the tough\r\nagility that makes all the difference. Weight? An easy matter enough\r\nto hang on with his weight and break an iron-shod pole. No, he was\r\nweakening, that was it. And the patient man is filled with bitterness\r\nat the thought--at least he might have been spared the shame of having\r\nInger here to see it!\r\n\r\nSuddenly he drops the lever and grasps the sledge. A fury takes him,\r\nhe is minded to go at it violently now. And see, his cap still hangs\r\non one ear, robber-fashion, and now he steps mightily, threateningly,\r\nround the stone, trying, as it were, to set himself in the proper\r\nlight; ho, he will leave that stone a ruin and a wreck of what it had\r\nbeen. Why not? When a man is filled with mortal hatred of a stone,\r\nit is a mere formality to crush it. And suppose the stone resists,\r\nsuppose it declines to be crushed? Why, let it try--and see which of\r\nthe two survives!\r\n\r\nBut then it is that Inger speaks up, a little timidly, again; seeing,\r\nno doubt, what is troubling him: "What if we both hang on the stick\r\nthere?" And the thing she calls a stick is the lever, nothing else.\r\n\r\n"No!" cries Isak furiously. But after a moment\'s thought he says:\r\n"Well, well, since you\'re here--though you might as well have gone\r\nhome. Let\'s try."\r\n\r\nAnd they get the stone up on edge. Ay, they manage that. And "Puh!"\r\nsays Isak.\r\n\r\nBut now comes a revelation, a strange thing to see. The underside of\r\nthe stone is flat, mightily broad, finely cut, smooth and even as\r\na floor. The stone is but the half of a stone, the other half is\r\nsomewhere close by, no doubt. Isak knows well enough that two halves\r\nof the same stone may lie in different places; the frost, no doubt,\r\nthat in course of time had shifted them apart. But he is all wonder\r\nand delight at the find; \'tis a useful stone of the best, a door-slab.\r\nA round sum of money would not have filled this fieldworker\'s mind\r\nwith such content. "A fine door-slab," says he proudly.\r\n\r\nAnd Inger, simple creature: "Why! Now how on earth could you tell that\r\nbeforehand?"\r\n\r\n"H\'m," says Isak. "Think I\'d go here digging about for nothing?"\r\n\r\nThey walk home together, Isak enjoying new admiration on false\r\npretences; \'twas something he had not deserved, but it tasted but\r\nlittle different from the real thing. He lets it be understood that he\r\nhas been looking out for a suitable door-slab for a long time, and had\r\nfound it at last. After that, of course, there could be nothing in the\r\nleast suspicious about his working there again; he could root about as\r\nmuch as he pleased on pretext of looking for the other half. And when\r\nSivert came home, he could get him to help.\r\n\r\nBut if it had come to this, that he could no longer go out alone and\r\nheave up a stone, why, things were sorely changed; ay, \'twas a bad\r\nlook-out, and the more need to get that site cleared quick as might\r\nbe. Age was upon him, he was ripening for the chimney-corner. The\r\ntriumph he had stolen in the matter of the door-slab faded away in a\r\nfew days; \'twas a false thing, and not made to last. Isak stooped a\r\nlittle now in his walk.\r\n\r\nHad he not once been so much of a man that he grew wakeful and\r\nattentive in a moment if one but said a word of stone, a word of\r\ndigging? And \'twas no long time since, but a few years, no more. Ay,\r\nand in those days, folk that were shy of a bit of draining work kept\r\nout of his way. Now he was beginning, little by little, to take such\r\nmatters more calmly; eyah, _Herregud_! All things were changed, the\r\nland itself was different now, with broad telegraph roads up through\r\nthe woods, that had not been there before, and rocks blasted and\r\nsundered up by the water, as they had not been before. And folk, too,\r\nwere changed. They did not greet coming and going as in the old days,\r\nbut nodded only, or maybe not even that.\r\n\r\nBut then--in the old days there had been no Sellanraa, but only a turf\r\nhut, while now.... There had been no Margrave in the old days.\r\n\r\nAy, but Margrave, what was he now? A pitiful thing, nothing\r\nsuperhuman, but old and fading, going the way of all flesh. What\r\nthough he had good bowels, and could eat well, when it gave him no\r\nstrength? \'Twas Sivert had the strength now, and a mercy it was\r\nso--but think, if Isak had had it too! A sorry thing, to find his\r\nworks running down. He had toiled like a man, carrying loads enough\r\nfor any beast of burden; now, he could exercise his patience in\r\nresting.\r\n\r\nIsak is ill-pleased, heavy at heart.\r\n\r\nHere lies an old hat, an old sou\'wester, rotting on the ground.\r\nCarried there by the gale, maybe, or maybe the lads had brought it\r\nthere to the edge of the wood years ago, when they were little ones.\r\nIt lies there year after year, rotting and rotting away; but once it\r\nhad been a new sou\'wester, all yellow and new. Isak remembers the day\r\nhe came home with it from the store, and Inger had said it was a fine\r\nhat. A year or so after, he had taken it to a painter down in the\r\nvillage, and had it blacked and polished, and the brim done in green.\r\nAnd when he came home, Inger thought it a finer hat than before. Inger\r\nalways thought everything was fine; ay, \'twas a good life those days,\r\ncutting faggots, with Inger to look on--his best days. And when March\r\nand April came, Inger and he would be wild after each other, just like\r\nthe birds and beasts in the woods; and when May was come, he would sow\r\nhis corn and plant potatoes, living and thriving from day to dawn.\r\nWork and sleep, loving and dreaming, he was like the first big ox, and\r\nthat was a wonder to see, big and bright as a king. But there was no\r\nsuch May to the years now. No such thing.\r\n\r\nIsak was sorely despondent for some days. Dark days they were. He felt\r\nneither wish nor strength to start work on the fodder loft--that could\r\nbe left for Sivert to do some day. The thing to be done now was the\r\nhouse for himself--the last house to build. He could not long hide\r\nfrom Sivert what he was doing; he was clearing the ground, and plain\r\nto see what for. And one day he told.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a good bit of stone if we\'d any use for stonework," said he.\r\n"And there\'s another."\r\n\r\nSivert showed no surprise, and only said: "Ay, first-rate stones."\r\n\r\n"What you might think," said his father.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve been digging round here now to find that other door-slab piece;\r\nmight almost do to build here. I don\'t know...."\r\n\r\n"Ay, \'tis no bad place to build," said Sivert, looking round.\r\n\r\n"Think so? \'Twas none so bad, maybe, to have a bit of a place to house\r\nfolk if any should come along."\r\n\r\n"Ay."\r\n\r\n"A couple of rooms\'d be as well. You saw how \'twas when they Swedish\r\ngentlemen came, and no proper place to house them. But what you think:\r\na bit of a kitchen as well, maybe, if \'twas any cooking to be done?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, \'twould be a shame to built with never a bit of kitchen," says\r\nSivert.\r\n\r\n"You think so?"\r\n\r\nIsak said no more. But Sivert, he was a fine lad to grasp things, and\r\nget into his head all at once just what was needed in a place to put\r\nup Swedish gentlemen that chanced to come along; never so much as\r\nasked a single question, but only said: "Doing it my way, now, you\'d\r\nput up a bit of a shed on the north wall. Folks coming along, \'d be\r\nuseful to have a shed place to hang up wet clothes and things."\r\n\r\nAnd his father agrees at once: "Ay, the very thing."\r\n\r\nThey work at their stones again in silence. Then asks Isak: "Eleseus,\r\nhe\'s not come home, I suppose?"\r\n\r\nAnd Sivert answers evasively: "He\'ll be coming home soon."\r\n\r\n\'Twas that way with Eleseus: he was all for staying away, living away\r\non journeys. Couldn\'t he have written for the goods? But he must go\r\nround and buy them on the spot. Got them so much cheaper. Ay, maybe,\r\nbut what about cost of the journey? He had his own way of thinking, it\r\nseemed. And then, what did he want, anyway, with more cotton stuff,\r\nand coloured ribbons for christening caps, and black and white straw\r\nhats, and long tobacco pipes? No one ever bought such things up in the\r\nhills; and the village folk, they only came up to Storborg when they\'d\r\nno money. Eleseus was clever enough in his way--only to see him write\r\non a paper, or do sums with a bit of chalk! "Ay, with a head like\r\nyours," said folk, admiring him. And that was true enough; but he was\r\nspending overmuch. They village folk never paid their owings, and yet\r\neven a fellow like Brede Olsen could come up to Storborg that winter\r\nand get cotton print and coffee and molasses and paraffin on credit.\r\n\r\nIsak has laid out a deal of money already for Eleseus, and his store\r\nand his long journeyings about; there\'s not overmuch left now out of\r\nthe riches from the mine--and what then?\r\n\r\n"How d\'you think he\'s getting on, Eleseus?" asks Isak suddenly.\r\n\r\n"Getting on?" says Sivert, to gain time.\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t seem to be doing so well."\r\n\r\n"H\'m. He says it\'ll go all right."\r\n\r\n"You spoken to him about it?"\r\n\r\n"Nay; but Andresen he says so."\r\n\r\nIsak thought over this, and shook his head. "Nay, I doubt it\'s going\r\nill," says he. "Tis a pity for the lad."\r\n\r\nAnd Isak gloomier than ever now, for all he\'d been none too bright\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nBut then Sivert flashes out a bit of news: "There\'s more folk coming\r\nto live now."\r\n\r\n"How d\'you say?"\r\n\r\n"Two new holdings. They\'ve bought up close by us."\r\n\r\nIsak stands still with his crowbar in hand; this was news, and good\r\nnews, the best that could be. "That makes ten of us here," says he.\r\nAnd Isak learns exactly where the new men have bought, he knows the\r\ncountry all round in his head, and nods. "Ay, they\'ve done well there;\r\nwood for firing in plenty, and some big timber here and there. Ground\r\nslopes down sou\'west. Ay...."\r\n\r\nSettlers--nothing could beat them, anyway--here were new folk coming\r\nto live. The mine had come to nothing, but so much the better for the\r\nland. A desert, a dying place? Far from it, all about was swarming\r\nwith life; two new men, four new hands to work, fields and meadows\r\nand homes. Oh, the little green tracts in a forest, a hut and water,\r\nchildren and cattle about. Corn waving on the moorlands where naught\r\nbut horsetail grew before, bluebells nodding on the fells, and yellow\r\nsunlight blazing in the ladyslipper flowers outside a house. And human\r\nbeings living there, move and talk and think and are there with heaven\r\nand earth.\r\n\r\nHere stands the first of them all, the first man in the wilds. He came\r\nthat way, kneedeep in marsh-growth and heather, found a sunny slope\r\nand settled there. Others came after him, they trod a path across the\r\nwaste _Almenning_; others again, and the path became a road; carts\r\ndrove there now. Isak may be content, may start with a little thrill\r\nof pride; he was the founder of a district, the pioneer.\r\n\r\n"Look here, we can\'t go wasting time on this bit of a house place if\r\nwe\'re to get that fodder loft done this year," says he.\r\n\r\nWith a new brightness, new spirit; as it were, new courage and life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X\r\n\r\n\r\nA woman tramping up along the road. A steady summer rain falls,\r\nwetting her, but she does not heed it; other things are in her\r\nmind--anxiety. Barbro it is, and no other--Brede\'s girl, Barbro.\r\nAnxious, ay; not knowing how the venture will end; she has gone from\r\nservice at the Lensmand\'s, and left the village. That is the matter.\r\n\r\nShe keeps away from all the farms on the road up, unwilling to meet\r\nwith folk; easy to see where she was going, with a bundle of clothing\r\non her back. Ay, going to Maaneland, to take service there again.\r\n\r\nTen months she has been at the Lensmand\'s now, and \'tis no little\r\ntime, reckoned out in days and nights, but an eternity reckoned in\r\nlonging and oppression. It had been bearable at first, Fru Heyerdahl\r\nlooking after her kindly, giving her aprons and neat things to wear;\r\n\'twas a joy to be sent on errands to the store with such fine clothes\r\nto wear. Barbro had been in the village as a child; she knew all the\r\nvillage folk from the days when she had played there, gone to school\r\nthere, kissed the lads there, and joined in many games with stones and\r\nshells. Bearable enough for a month or so. But then Fru Heyerdahl\r\nhad begun to be even more careful about her, and when the Christmas\r\nfestivities began, she was strict. And what good could ever come of\r\nthat? It was bound to spoil things. Barbro could never have endured it\r\nbut that she had certain hours of the night to herself; from two to\r\nsix in the morning she was more or less safe, and had stolen pleasures\r\nnot a few. What about Cook, then, for not reporting her? A nice sort\r\nof woman she must be! Oh, an ordinary woman enough, as the world finds\r\nthem; Cook went out without leave herself. They took it in turns. And\r\nit was quite a long time before they were found out. Barbro was by no\r\nmeans so depraved that it showed in her face, impossible to accuse\r\nher of immorality. Immorality? She made all the resistance one could\r\nexpect. When young men asked her to go to a Christmas dance, she said\r\n"No" once, said "No" twice, but the third time she would say: "I\'ll\r\ntry and come from two to six." Just as a decent woman should, not\r\ntrying to make herself out worse than she is, and making a display\r\nof daring. She was a servant-girl, serving all her time, and knew no\r\nother recreation than fooling with men. It was all she asked for. Fru\r\nHeyerdahl came and lectured her, lent her books--and a fool for her\r\npains. Barbro had lived in Bergen and read the papers and been to the\r\ntheatre! She was no innocent lamb from the countryside ...\r\n\r\nBut Fru Heyerdahl must have grown suspicious at last. One day she\r\ncomes up at three in the morning to the maids\' room and calls:\r\n"Barbro!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," answers Cook.\r\n\r\n"It\'s Barbro I want. Isn\'t she there? Open the door."\r\n\r\nCook opens the door and explains as agreed upon, that Barbro had had\r\nto run home for a minute about something. Home for a minute at this\r\ntime of night? Fru Heyerdahl has a good deal to say about that. And\r\nin the morning there is a scene. Brede is sent for, and Fru Heyerdahl\r\nasks: "Was Barbro at home with you last night--at three o\'clock?"\r\n\r\nBrede is unprepared, but answers: "Three o\'clock? Yes, yes, quite\r\nright. We sat up late, there was something we had to talk about," says\r\nBrede.\r\n\r\nThe Lensmand\'s lady then solemnly declares that Barbro shall go out no\r\nmore at nights.\r\n\r\n"No, no," says Brede.\r\n\r\n"Not as long as she\'s in this house."\r\n\r\n"No, no; there, you can see, Barbro, I told you so," says her father.\r\n\r\n"You can go and see your parents now and then during the day," says\r\nher mistress.\r\n\r\nBut Fru Heyerdahl was wide awake enough, and her suspicion was not\r\ngone; she waited a week, and tried at four in the morning. "Barbro!"\r\nshe called. Oh, but this time \'twas Cook\'s turn out, and Barbro was at\r\nhome; the maids\' room was a nest of innocence. Her mistress had to hit\r\non something in a hurry.\r\n\r\n"Did you take in the washing last night?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a good thing, it\'s blowing so hard.... Good-night."\r\n\r\nBut it was not so pleasant for Fru Heyerdahl to get her husband to\r\nwake her in the middle of the night and go padding across herself to\r\nthe servants\' room to see if they were at home. They could do as they\r\npleased, she would trouble herself no more.\r\n\r\nAnd if it had not been for sheer ill-luck, Barbro might have stayed\r\nthe year out in her place that way. But a few days ago the trouble had\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nIt was in the kitchen, early one morning. Barbro had been having some\r\nwords with Cook, and no light words either; they raised their voices,\r\nforgetting all about their mistress. Cook was a mean thing and a\r\ncheat, she had sneaked off last night out of her turn because it was\r\nSunday. And what excuse had she to give? Going to say good-bye to her\r\nfavourite sister that was off to America? Not a bit of it; Cook had\r\nmade no excuse at all, but simply said that Sunday night was one had\r\nbeen owing to her for a long time.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'ve not an atom of truth nor decency in your body!" said\r\nBarbro.\r\n\r\nAnd there was the mistress in the doorway.\r\n\r\nShe had come out, perhaps, with no more thought than that the girls\r\nwere making too much noise, but now she stood looking, very closely\r\nat Barbro, at Barbro\'s apron over her breast; ay, leaning forward and\r\nlooking very closely indeed. It was a painful moment. And suddenly Fru\r\nHeyerdahl screams and draws back to the door. What on earth can it be?\r\nthinks Barbro, and looks down at herself. _Herregud_! a flea, nothing\r\nmore. Barbro cannot help smiling, and being not unused to acting under\r\ncritical circumstances, she flicks off the flea at once.\r\n\r\n"On the floor!" cried Fru Heyerdahl. "Are you mad, girl? Pick it up\r\nat once!" Barbro begins looking about for it, and once more acts with\r\npresence of mind: she makes as if she had caught the creature, and\r\ndrops it realistically into the fire.\r\n\r\n"Where did you get it?" asks her mistress angrily.\r\n\r\n"Where I got it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s what I want to know."\r\n\r\nBut here Barbro makes a bad mistake. "At the store," she ought to have\r\nsaid, of course--that would have been quite enough. As it was--she did\r\nnot know where she had got the creature, but had an idea it must have\r\nbeen from Cook.\r\n\r\nCook at the height of passion at once: "From me! You\'ll please to keep\r\nyour fleas to yourself, so there!"\r\n\r\n"Anyway, \'twas you was out last night."\r\n\r\nAnother mistake--she should have said nothing about it. Cook has no\r\nlonger any reason for keeping silence, and now she let out the\r\nwhole thing, and told all about the nights Barbro had been out. Fru\r\nHeyerdahl mightily indignant; she cares nothing about Cook, \'tis\r\nBarbro she is after, the girl whose character she has answered for.\r\nAnd even then all might have been well if Barbro had bowed her head\r\nlike a reed, and been cast down with shame, and promised all manner of\r\nthings for the future--but no. Her mistress is forced to remind her of\r\nall she has done for her, and at that, if you please, Barbro falls to\r\nanswering back, ay, so foolish was she, saying impertinent things. Or\r\nperhaps she was cleverer than might seem; trying on purpose, maybe, to\r\nbring the matter to a head, and get out of the place altogether? Says\r\nher mistress:\r\n\r\n"After I\'ve saved you from the clutches of the Law."\r\n\r\n"As for that," answers Barbro, "I\'d have just as pleased if you\r\nhadn\'t."\r\n\r\n"And that\'s all the thanks I get," says her mistress.\r\n\r\n"Least said the better, perhaps," says Barbro. "I wouldn\'t have got\r\nmore than a month or two, anyway, and done with it."\r\n\r\nFru Heyerdahl is speechless for a moment; ay, for a little while she\r\nstands saying nothing, only opening and closing her mouth. The first\r\nthing she says is to tell the girl to go; she will have no more of\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Just as you please," says Barbro.\r\n\r\nFor some days after that Barbro had been at home with her parents. But\r\nshe could not go on staying there. True, her mother sold coffee, and\r\nthere came a deal of folk to the house, but Barbro could not live on\r\nthat--and maybe she had other reasons of her own for wanting to get\r\ninto a settled position again. And so today she had taken a sack of\r\nclothes on her back, and started up along the road over the moors.\r\nQuestion now, whether Axel Stroem would take her? But she had had the\r\nbanns put up, anyway, the Sunday before.\r\n\r\nRaining, and dirty underfoot, but Barbro tramps on. Evening is drawing\r\non, but not dark yet at that season of the year. Poor Barbro--she does\r\nnot spare herself, but goes on her errand like another; she is bound\r\nfor a place, to commence another struggle there. She has never spared\r\nherself, to tell the truth, never been of a lazy sort, and that is why\r\nshe has her neat figure now and pretty shape. Barbro is quick to learn\r\nthings, and often to her own undoing; what else could one expect? She\r\nhad learned to save herself at a pinch, to slip from one scrape to\r\nanother, but keeping all along some better qualities; a child\'s death\r\nis nothing to her, but she can still give sweets to a child alive.\r\nThen she has a fine musical ear, can strum softly and correctly on a\r\nguitar, singing hoarsely the while; pleasant and slightly mournful\r\nto hear. Spared herself? no; so little, indeed, that she has thrown\r\nherself away altogether, and felt no loss. Now and again she cries,\r\nand breaks her heart over this or that in her life--but that is\r\nonly natural, it goes with the songs she sings, \'tis the poetry and\r\nfriendly sweetness in her; she had fooled herself and many another\r\nwith the same. Had she been able to bring the guitar with her this\r\nevening she could have strummed a little for Axel when she came.\r\n\r\nShe manages so as to arrive late in the, evening; all is quiet\r\nat Maaneland when she reaches there. See, Axel has already begun\r\nhaymaking, the grass is cut near the house, and some of the hay\r\nalready in. And then she reckons out that Oline, being old, will be\r\nsleeping in the little room, and Axel lying out in the hayshed, just\r\nas she herself had done. She goes to the door she knows so well,\r\nbreathless as a thief, and calls softly: "Axel!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" asks Axel all at once.\r\n\r\n"Nay, \'tis only me," says Barbro, and steps in. "You couldn\'t house me\r\nfor the night?" she says.\r\n\r\nAxel looks at her and is slow to think, and sits there in his\r\nunderclothes, looking at her. "So \'tis you," says he. "And where\'ll\r\nyou be going?"\r\n\r\n"Why, depends first of all if you\'ve need of help to the summer work,"\r\nsays she.\r\n\r\nAxel thinks over that, and says: "Aren\'t you going to stay where you\r\nwere, then?"\r\n\r\n"Nay; I\'ve finished at the Lensmand\'s."\r\n\r\n"I might be needing help, true enough, for the summer," said Axel.\r\n"But what\'s it mean, anyway, you wanting to come back?"\r\n\r\n"Nay, never mind me," says Barbro, putting it off. "I\'ll go on again\r\ntomorrow. Go to Sellanraa and cross the hills. I\'ve a place there."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve fixed up with some one there?"\r\n\r\n"Ay."\r\n\r\n"I might be needing summer help myself," says Axel again.\r\n\r\nBarbro is wet through; she has other clothes in her sack, and must\r\nchange. "Don\'t mind about me," says Axel, and moves a bit toward the\r\ndoor, no more.\r\n\r\nBarbro takes off her wet clothes, they talking the while, and Axel\r\nturning his head pretty often towards her. "Now you\'d better go out\r\njust a bit," says she.\r\n\r\n"Out?" says he. And indeed \'twas no weather to go out in. He stands\r\nthere, seeing her more and more stripped; \'tis hard to keep his eyes\r\naway; and Barbro is so thoughtless, she might well have put on dry\r\nthings bit by bit as she took oft the wet, but no. Her shift is thin\r\nand clings to her; she unfastens a button at one shoulder, and turns\r\naside, \'tis nothing new for her. Axel dead silent then, and he sees\r\nhow she makes but a touch or two with her hands and washes the last of\r\nher clothes from her. \'Twas splendidly done, to his mind. And there\r\nshe stands, so utterly thoughtless of her....\r\n\r\nA while after, they lay talking together. Ay, he had need of help for\r\nthe summer, no doubt about that.\r\n\r\n"They said something that way," says Barbro.\r\n\r\nHe had begun his mowing and haymaking all alone again; Barbro could\r\njudge for herself how awkward it was for him now.--Ay, Barbro\r\nunderstood.--On the other hand, it was Barbro herself that had run\r\naway and left him before, without a soul to help him, he can\'t forget\r\nthat. And taken her rings with her into the bargain. And on top of all\r\nthat, shameful as it was, the paper that kept on coming, that Bergen\r\nnewspaper it seemed he would never get rid of; he had had to go on\r\npaying for it a whole year after.\r\n\r\n"\'Twas shameful mean of them," says Barbro, taking his part all the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nBut seeing her all submissive and gentle, Axel himself could not be\r\naltogether heartless towards her; he agreed that Barbro might have\r\nsome reason to be angry with him in return for the way he had taken\r\nthe telegraph business from her father. "But as for that," said he,\r\n"your father can have the telegraph business again for me; I\'ll have\r\nno more of it, \'tis but a waste of time."\r\n\r\n"Ay," says Barbro.\r\n\r\nAxel thought for a while, then asked straight out: "Well, what about\r\nit now, would you want to come for the summer and no more?"\r\n\r\n"Nay," says Barbro, "let it be as you please."\r\n\r\n"You mean that, and truly?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, just as you please, and I\'ll be pleased with the same. You\'ve no\r\ncall to doubt about me any more."\r\n\r\n"H\'m."\r\n\r\n"No, \'tis true. And I\'ve ordered about the banns."\r\n\r\nH\'m. This was not so bad. Axel lay thinking it over a long time. If\r\nshe meant it in earnest this time, and not shameful deceit again, then\r\nhe\'d a woman of his own and help for as long as might be.\r\n\r\n"I could get a woman to come from our parts," said he, "and she\'s\r\nwritten saying she\'d come. But then I\'d have to pay her fare from\r\nAmerica."\r\n\r\nSays Barbro: "Ho, she\'s in America, then?"\r\n\r\n"Ay. Went over last year she did, but doesn\'t care to stay."\r\n\r\n"Never mind about her," says Barbro. "And what\'d become of me then?"\r\nsays she, and begins to be soft and mournful.\r\n\r\n"No. That\'s why I\'ve not fixed up all certain with her."\r\n\r\nAnd after that, Barbro must have something to show in return; she\r\nconfessed about how she could have taken a lad in Bergen, and he was\r\na carter in a big brewery, a mighty big concern, and a good position.\r\n"And he\'ll be sorrowing for me now, I doubt," says Barbro, and makes\r\na little sob. "But you know how \'tis, Axel; when there\'s two been so\r\nmuch together as you and I, \'tis more than I could ever forget. And\r\nyou can forget me as much as you please."\r\n\r\n"What! me?" says Axel. "Nay, no need to lie there crying for that, my\r\ngirl, for I\'ve never forgot you."\r\n\r\n"Well...."\r\n\r\nBarbro feels a deal better after that confession, and says: "Anyway,\r\npaying her fare all the way from America when there\'s no need...." She\r\nadvises him to have nothing to do with that business; \'twould be over\r\ncostly, and there was no need. Barbro seemed resolved to build up his\r\nhappiness herself.\r\n\r\nThey came to agreement all round in the course of the night. \'Twas not\r\nas if they were strangers; they had talked over everything before.\r\nEven the necessary marriage ceremony was to take place before St.\r\nOlaf\'s Day and harvest; they had no need to hide things, and Barbro\r\nwas now herself most eager to get it done at once. Axel was not any\r\nput out at her eagerness, and it did not make him any way suspicious;\r\nfar from it, he was flattered and encouraged to find her so. Ay, he\r\nwas a worker in the fields, no doubt, a thick-skinned fellow, not used\r\nto looking over fine at things, nothing delicate beyond measure; there\r\nwere things he was obliged to do, and he looked to what was useful\r\nfirst of all. Moreover, here was Barbro all new and pretty again, and\r\nnice to him, almost sweeter than before. Like an apple she was, and he\r\nbit at it. The banns were already put up.\r\n\r\nAs to the dead child and the trial, neither said a word of that.\r\n\r\nBut they did speak of Oline, of how they were to get rid of her. "Ay,\r\nshe must go," said Barbro. "We\'ve nothing to thank her for, anyway.\r\nShe\'s naught but tale-bearing and malice."\r\n\r\nBut it proved no easy matter to get Oline to go.\r\n\r\nThe very first morning, when Barbro appeared, Oline was clear, no\r\ndoubt, as to her fate. She was troubled at once, but tried not to show\r\nit, and brought out a chair. They had managed up to then at Maaneland.\r\nAxel had carried water and wood and done the heaviest work, and Oline\r\ndoing the rest. And gradually she had come to reckon on staying the\r\nrest of her life on the place. Now came Barbro and upset it all.\r\n\r\n"If we\'d only a grain of coffee in the house you should have it," said\r\nshe to Barbro. "Going farther up, maybe?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Barbro.\r\n\r\n"Ho! Not going farther?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Why, \'tis no business of mine, no," says Oline. "Going down again,\r\nmaybe?"\r\n\r\n"No. Nor going down again. I\'m staying here for now."\r\n\r\n"Staying here, are you?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, staying here, I doubt."\r\n\r\nOline waits for a moment, using her old head, full of policy. "Ay,\r\nwell," says she. "\'Twill save me, then, no doubt. And glad I\'ll be for\r\nthe same."\r\n\r\n"Oho," says Barbro in jest, "has Axel here been so hard on you this\r\nwhile?"\r\n\r\n"Hard on me? Axel! Oh, there\'s no call to turn an old body\'s words,\r\nthere\'s naught but living on and waiting for the blessed end. Axel\r\nthat\'s been as a father and a messenger from the Highest to me day and\r\nhour together, and gospel truth the same. But seeing I\'ve none of my\r\nown folks here, and living alone and rejected under a stranger\'s roof,\r\nwith all my kin over across the hills...."\r\n\r\nBut for all that, Oline stayed on. They could not get rid of her till\r\nafter they were wed, and Oline made a deal of reluctance, but said\r\n"Yes" at last, and would stay so long to please them, and look to\r\nhouse and cattle while they went down to the church. It took two days.\r\nBut when they came back wedded and all, Oline stayed on as before. She\r\nput off going; one day she was feeling poorly, she said; the next it\r\nlooked like rain. She made up to Barbro with smooth words about the\r\nfood. Oh, there was a mighty difference in the food now at Maaneland;\r\n\'twas different living now, and a mighty difference in the coffee\r\nnow. Oh, she stopped at nothing, that Oline; asked Barbro\'s advice on\r\nthings she knew better herself. "What you think now, should I milk\r\ncows as they stand in their place and order, or should I take cow\r\nBordelin first?"\r\n\r\n"You can do as you please."\r\n\r\n"Ay, \'tis as I always said," exclaims Oline. "You\'ve been out in the\r\nworld and lived among great folks and fine folks, and learned all and\r\neverything. \'Tis different with the likes of me."\r\n\r\nAy, Oline stopped at nothing, she was intriguing all day long. Sitting\r\nthere telling Barbro how she herself was friends and on the best of\r\nterms with Barbro\'s father, with Brede Olsen! Ho, many a pleasant hour\r\nthey\'d had together, and a kindly man and rich and grand to boot was\r\nBrede, and never a hard word in his mouth.\r\n\r\nBut this could not go on for ever; neither Axel nor Barbro cared to\r\nhave Oline there any longer, and Barbro had taken over all her work.\r\nOline made no complaint, but she flashed dangerous glances at her\r\nyoung mistress and changed her tone ever so little.\r\n\r\n"Ay, great folk, \'tis true. Axel, he was in town a while last\r\nharvest-time--you didn\'t meet him there, maybe? Nay, that\'s true, you\r\nwere in Bergen that time. But he went into town, he did; \'twas all\r\nto buy a mowing-machine and a harrow-machine. And what\'s folk at\r\nSellanraa now beside you here? Nothing to compare!"\r\n\r\nShe was beginning to shoot out little pinpricks, but even that did not\r\nhelp her now; neither of them feared her. Axel told her straight out\r\none day that she must go.\r\n\r\n"Go?" says Oline. "And how? Crawling, belike?" No, she would not go,\r\nsaying by way of excuse that she was poorly, and could not move her\r\nlegs. And to make things bad as could be, when once they had taken the\r\nwork off her hands, and she had nothing to do at all, she collapsed,\r\nand was thoroughly ill. She kept about for a week in spite of it, Axel\r\nlooking furiously at her; but she stayed on from sheer malice, and at\r\nlast she had to take to her bed.\r\n\r\nAnd now she lay there, not in the least awaiting her blessed end, but\r\ncounting the hours till she should be up and about again. She asked\r\nfor a doctor, a piece of extravagance unheard of in the wilds.\r\n\r\n"Doctor?" said Axel. "Are you out of your senses?"\r\n\r\n"How d\'you mean, then?" said Oline quite gently, as to something she\r\ncould not understand. Ay, so gentle and smooth-tongued was she, so\r\nglad to think she need not be a burden to others; she could pay for\r\nthe doctor herself.\r\n\r\n"Ho, can you?" said Axel.\r\n\r\n"Why, and couldn\'t I, then?" says Oline. "And, anyway, you\'d not have\r\nme lie here and die like a dumb beast in the face of the Lord?"\r\n\r\nHere Barbro put in a word, and was unwise enough to say:\r\n\r\n"Well, what you\'ve got to complain of, I\'d like to know, when I bring\r\nyou in your meals and all myself? As for coffee, I\'ve said you\'re\r\nbetter without it, and meaning well."\r\n\r\n"Is that Barbro?" says Oline, turning just her eyes and no more to\r\nlook for her; ay, she is poorly is Oline, and a pitiful sight with her\r\neyes screwed round cornerways. "Ay, maybe \'tis as you say, Barbro, if\r\na tiny drop of coffee\'d do me any harm, a spoonful and no more."\r\n\r\n"If \'twas me in your stead, I\'d be thinking of other things than\r\ncoffee at this hour," says Barbro.\r\n\r\n"Ay, \'tis as I say," answers Oline. "\'Twas never your way to wish and\r\ndesire a fellow-creature\'s end, but rather they should be converted\r\nand live. What ... ay, I\'m lying here and seeing things.... Is it with\r\nchild you are now, Barbro?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s that you say?" cries Barbro furiously; and goes on again: "Oh,\r\n\'twould serve you right if I took and heaved you out on the muck-heap\r\nfor your wicked tongue."\r\n\r\nAnd at that the invalid was silent for one thoughtful moment, her\r\nmouth trembling as if trying so hard to smile, but dare not.\r\n\r\n"I heard a some one calling last night," says she.\r\n\r\n"She\'s out of her senses," says Axel, whispering.\r\n\r\n"Nay, out of my senses that I\'m not. Like some one calling it was.\r\nFrom the woods, or maybe from the stream up yonder. Strange to\r\nhear--as it might be a bit of a child crying out. Was that Barbro went\r\nout?"\r\n\r\n"Ay," says Axel. "Sick of your nonsense, and no wonder."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, you call it, and out of my senses, and all? Ah, but not so\r\nfar as you\'d like to think," says Oline. "Nay, \'tis not the Almighty\'s\r\nwill and decree I should come before the Throne and before the Lamb as\r\nyet, with all I know of goings-on here at Maaneland. I\'ll be up and\r\nabout again, never fear; but you\'d better be fetching a doctor, Axel,\r\n\'tis quicker that way. What about that cow you were going to give me?"\r\n\r\n"Cow? What cow?"\r\n\r\n"That cow you promised me. Was it Bordelin, maybe?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re talking wild," says Axel.\r\n\r\n"You know how you promised me a cow the day I saved your life."\r\n\r\n"Nay, that I never knew."\r\n\r\nAt that Oline lifts up her head and looks at him. Grey and bald she\r\nis, a head standing up on a long, scraggy neck--ugly as a witch, as an\r\nogress out of a story. And Axel starts at the sight, and fumbles with\r\na hand behind his back for the latch of the door.\r\n\r\n"Ho," says Oline, "so you\'re that sort! Ay, well--say no more of it\r\nnow. I can live without the cow from this day forth, and never a word\r\nI\'ll say nor breathe of it again. But well that you\'ve shown what sort\r\nand manner of man you are this day; I know it now. Ay, and I\'ll know\r\nit another time."\r\n\r\nBut Oline, she died that night--some time in the night; anyway, she\r\nwas cold next morning when they came in.\r\n\r\nOline--an aged creature. Born and died....\r\n\r\n\'Twas no sorrow to Axel nor Barbro to bury her, and be quit of her for\r\never; there was less to be on their guard against now, they could be\r\nat rest. Barbro is having trouble with her teeth again; save for that,\r\nall is well. But that everlasting woollen muffler over her face, and\r\nshifting it aside every time there\'s a word to say--\'twas plaguy and\r\ntroublesome enough, and all this toothache is something of a mystery\r\nto Axel. He has noticed, certainly, that she chews her food in a\r\ncareful sort of way, but there\'s not a tooth missing in her head.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you get new teeth?" he asks.\r\n\r\n"Ay, so I did."\r\n\r\n"And are they aching, too?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, you with your nonsense!" says Barbro irritably, for all that Axel\r\nhas asked innocently enough. And in her bitterness she lets out what\r\nis the matter. "You can see how \'tis with me, surely?"\r\n\r\nHow \'twas with her? Axel looks closer, and fancies she is stouter than\r\nneed be.\r\n\r\n"Why, you can\'t be--\'tis surely not another child again?" says he.\r\n\r\n"Why, you know it is," says she.\r\n\r\nAxel stares foolishly at her. Slow of thought as he is, he sits there\r\ncounting for a bit: one week, two weeks, getting on the third week....\r\n\r\n"Nay, how I should know...." says he.\r\n\r\nBut Barbro is losing all patience with this debate, and bursts out,\r\ncrying aloud, crying like a deeply injured creature: "Nay, you can\r\ntake and bury me, too, in the ground, and then you\'ll be rid of me."\r\n\r\nStrange, what odd things a woman can find to cry for!\r\n\r\nAxel had never a thought of, burying her in the ground; he is a\r\nthick-skinned fellow, looking mainly to what is useful; a pathway\r\ncarpeted with flowers is beyond his needs.\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ll not be fit to work in the fields this summer?" says he.\r\n\r\n"Not work?" says Barbro, all terrified again. And then--strange what\r\nodd things a woman can find to smile for! Axel, taking it that way,\r\nsent a flow of hysterical joy through Barbro, and she burst out: "I\'ll\r\nwork for two! Oh, you wait and see, Axel; I\'ll do all you set me to,\r\nand more beyond. Wear myself to the bone, I will, and be thankful, if\r\nonly you\'ll put up with me so!"\r\n\r\nMore tears and smiles and tenderness after that. Only the two of them\r\nin the wilds, none to disturb them; open doors and a humming of flies\r\nin the summer heat. All so tender and willing was Barbro; ay, he might\r\ndo as he pleased with her, and she was willing.\r\n\r\nAfter sunset he stands harnessing up to the mowing-machine; there\'s a\r\nbit he can still get done ready for tomorrow. Barbro comes hurrying\r\nout, as if she\'s something important, and says:\r\n\r\n"Axel, how ever could you think of getting one home from America? She\r\ncouldn\'t get here before winter, and what use of her then?" And that\r\nwas something had just come into her head, and she must come running\r\nout with it as if \'twas something needful.\r\n\r\nBut \'twas no way needful; Axel had seen from the first that taking\r\nBarbro would mean getting help for all the year. No swaying and\r\nswinging with Axel, no thinking with his head among the stars. Now\r\nhe\'s a woman of his own to look after the place, he can keep on the\r\ntelegraph business for a bit. \'Tis a deal of money in the year, and\r\ngood to reckon with as long as he\'s barely enough for his needs from\r\nthe land, and little to sell. All sound and working well; all good\r\nreality. And little to fear from Brede about the telegraph line,\r\nseeing he\'s son-in-law to Brede now.\r\n\r\nAy, things are looking well, looking grand with Axel now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd time goes on; winter is passed; spring comes again.\r\n\r\nIsak has to go down to the village one day--and why not? What for?\r\n"Nay, I don\'t know," says he. But he gets the cart cleaned up all\r\nfine, puts in the seat, and drives off, and a deal of victuals and\r\nsuch put in, too--and why not? \'Twas for Eleseus at Storborg. Never a\r\nhorse went out from Sellanraa but there was something taken down to\r\nEleseus.\r\n\r\nWhen Isak came driving down over the moors, \'twas no little event, for\r\nhe came but rarely, Sivert going most ways in his stead. At the two\r\nfarms nearest down, folk stand at the door of the huts and tell one\r\nanother: "\'Tis Isak himself; and what\'ll he be going down after\r\ntoday?" And, coming down as far as to Maaneland, there\'s Barbro at the\r\nglass window with a child in her arms, and sees him, and says: "\'Tis\r\nIsak himself!"\r\n\r\nHe comes to Storborg and pulls up. "_Ptro_! Is Eleseus at home?"\r\n\r\nEleseus comes out. Ay, he\'s at home; not gone yet, but just going--off\r\non his spring tour of the towns down south.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s some things your mother sent down," says his father. "Don\'t\r\nknow what it is, but nothing much, I doubt."\r\n\r\nEleseus takes the things, and thanks him, and asks:\r\n\r\n"There wasn\'t a letter, I suppose, or anything that sort?"\r\n\r\n"Ay," says his father, feeling in pockets, "there was. \'Tis from\r\nlittle Rebecca I think they said."\r\n\r\nEleseus takes the letter, \'tis that he has been waiting for. Feels it\r\nall nice and thick, and says to his father:\r\n\r\n"Well, \'twas lucky you came in time--though \'tis two days before I\'m\r\noff yet. If you\'d like to stay a bit, you might take my trunk down."\r\n\r\nIsak gets down and ties up his horse, and goes for a stroll over the\r\nground. Little Andresen is no bad worker on the land in Eleseus\'\r\nservice; true, he has had Sivert from Sellanraa with horses, but he\r\nhas done a deal of work on his own account, draining bogs, and hiring\r\na man himself to set the ditches with stone. No need of buying fodder\r\nat Storborg that year, and next, like as not, Eleseus would be keeping\r\na horse of his own. Thanks to Andresen and the way he worked on the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nAfter a bit of a while, Eleseus calls down that he\'s ready with his\r\ntrunk. Ready to go himself, too, by the look of it; in a fine blue\r\nsuit, white collar, galoshes, and a walking-stick. True, he will have\r\ntwo days to wait for the boat, but no matter; he may just as well stay\r\ndown in the village; \'tis all the same if he\'s here or there.\r\n\r\nAnd father and son drive off. Andresen watches them from the door of\r\nthe shop and wishes a pleasant journey.\r\n\r\nIsak is all thought for his boy, and would give him the seat to\r\nhimself; but Eleseus will have none of that, and \'sits up by his side.\r\nThey come to Breidablik, and suddenly Eleseus has forgotten something.\r\n"_Ptro_!--What is it?" asks his father.\r\n\r\nOh, his umbrella! Eleseus has forgotten his umbrella; but he can\'t\r\nexplain all about it, and only says: "Never mind, drive on."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you want to turn back?"\r\n\r\n"No; drive on."\r\n\r\nBut a nuisance it was; how on earth had he come to leave it? \'Twas all\r\nin a hurry, through his father being there waiting. Well, now he had\r\nbetter buy a new umbrella at Trondhjem when he got there. \'Twas no\r\nimportance either way if he had one umbrella or two. But for all that,\r\nEleseus is out of humour with himself; so much so that he jumps down\r\nand walks behind.\r\n\r\nThey could hardly talk much on the way down after that, seeing Isak\r\nhad to turn round every time and speak over his shoulder. Says Isak:\r\n"How long you\'re going to be away?"\r\n\r\nAnd Eleseus answers: "Oh, say three weeks, perhaps, or a month at the\r\noutside."\r\n\r\nHis father marvels how folk don\'t get lost in the big towns, and never\r\nfind their way back. But Eleseus answers, as to that, he\'s used to\r\nliving in towns, and never got lost, never had done in his life.\r\n\r\nIsak thinks it a shame to be sitting up there all alone, and calls\r\nout: "Here, you come and drive a bit; I\'m getting tired."\r\n\r\nEleseus won\'t hear of his father getting down, and gets up beside\r\nhim again. But first they must have something to eat--out of Isak\'s\r\nwell-filled pack. Then they drive on again.\r\n\r\nThey come to the two holdings farthest down; easy to see they are\r\nnearing the village now; both the houses have white curtains in the\r\nlittle window facing toward the road, and a flag-pole stuck up on top\r\nof the hayloft for Constitution Day. "\'Tis Isak himself," said folk on\r\nthe two new farms as the cart went by.\r\n\r\nAt last Eleseus gives over thinking of his own affairs and his own\r\nprecious self enough to ask: "What you driving down for today?"\r\n\r\n"H\'m," says his father. "\'Twas nothing much today." But then, after\r\nall, Eleseus was going away; no harm, perhaps, in telling him. "\'Tis\r\nblacksmith\'s girl, Jensine, I\'m going down for," says his father; ay,\r\nhe admits so much.\r\n\r\n"And you\'re going down yourself for that? Couldn\'t Sivert have gone?"\r\nsays Eleseus. Ay, Eleseus knew no better, nothing better than to think\r\nSivert would go down to the smith\'s to fetch Jensine, after she had\r\nthought so much of herself as to leave Sellanraa!\r\n\r\nNo, \'twas all awry with the haymaking the year before. Inger had put\r\nin all she could, as she had promised. Leopoldine did her share too,\r\nnot to speak of having a machine for a horse to rake. But the hay\r\nwas much of it heavy stuff, and the fields were big. Sellanraa was a\r\nsizeable place now, and the women had other things to look to besides\r\nmaking hay; all the cattle to look to, and meals to be got, and all\r\nin proper time; butter and cheese to make, and clothes to wash, and\r\nbaking of bread; mother and daughter working all they could. Isak was\r\nnot going to have another summer like that; he decided without any\r\nfuss that Jensine should come back again if she could be got. Inger,\r\ntoo, had no longer a word against it; she had come to her senses\r\nagain, and said: "Ay, do as you think best." Ay, Inger was grown\r\nreasonable now; \'tis no little thing to come to one\'s senses again\r\nafter a spell. Inger was no longer full of heat that must out, no\r\nlonger full of wild blood to be kept in check, the winter had cooled\r\nher; nothing beyond the needful warmth in her now. She was getting\r\nstouter, growing fine and stately. A wonderful woman to keep from\r\nfading, keep from dying off by degrees; like enough because she had\r\nbloomed so late in life. Who can say how things come about? Nothing\r\ncomes from a single cause, but from many. Was Inger not in the best\r\nrepute with the smith\'s wife? What could any smith\'s wife say against\r\nher? With her disfigurement, she had been cheated of her spring, and\r\nlater, had been set in artificial air to lose six years of her summer;\r\nwith life still in her, what wonder her autumn gave an errant growth?\r\nInger was better than blacksmiths\' wives--a little damaged, a little\r\nwarped, but good by nature, clever by nature ... ay....\r\n\r\nFather and son drive down, they come to Brede Olsen\'s lodging-house\r\nand set the horse in a shed. It is evening now. They go in themselves.\r\n\r\nBrede Olsen has rented the house; an outbuilding it had been,\r\nbelonging to the storekeeper, but done up now with two sitting-rooms\r\nand two bedrooms; none so bad, and in a good situation. The place\r\nis well frequented by coffee-drinkers and folk from round about the\r\nvillage going by the boat.\r\n\r\nBrede seems to have been in luck for once, found something suited to\r\nhim, and he may thank his wife for that. \'Twas Brede\'s wife had hit on\r\nthe idea of a coffee-shop and lodging-house, the day she sat selling\r\ncoffee at the auction at Breidablik; \'twas a pleasant enough thing to\r\nbe selling something, to feel money in her fingers, ready cash. Since\r\nthey had come down here they had managed nicely, selling coffee in\r\nearnest now, and housing a deal of folk with nowhere else to lay their\r\nheads. A blessing to travellers, is Brede\'s wife. She has a good\r\nhelper, of course, in Katrine, her daughter, a big girl now and clever\r\nat waiting--though that is only for the time, of course; not long\r\nbefore little Katrine must have something better than waiting on folk\r\nin her parents\' house. But for the present, they are making money\r\nfairly well, and that is the main thing. The start had been decidedly\r\nfavourable, and might have been better if the storekeeper had not run\r\nshort of cakes and sweet biscuits to serve with the coffee; here were\r\nall the feast-day folk calling for cakes with their coffee, biscuits\r\nand cakes! \'Twas a lesson to the storekeeper to lay in a good supply\r\nanother time.\r\n\r\nThe family, and Brede himself, live as best they can on their takings.\r\nA good many meals are nothing but coffee and stale cakes left over,\r\nbut it keeps them alive, and gives the children a delicate, sort of\r\nrefined appearance. \'Tis not every one has cakes with their coffee,\r\nsay the village folk. Ay, Bredes are doing well, it seems; they even\r\nmanage to keep a dog, that goes round begging among the customers and\r\ngets bits here and there and grows fat on it. A good fat dog about the\r\nplace is a mighty fine advertisement for a lodging-house; it speaks\r\nfor good feeding anywhere.\r\n\r\nBrede, then, is husband and father in the house, and apart from that\r\nposition, has got on variously beside. He had been once more installed\r\nas Lensmand\'s assistant and deputy, and had a good deal to do that way\r\nfor a time. Unfortunately, his daughter Barbro had fallen out with\r\nthe Lensmand\'s wife last autumn, about a trifling matter, a mere\r\nnothing--indeed, to tell the truth, a flea; and Brede himself is\r\nsomewhat in disfavour there since. But Brede counts it no great loss,\r\nafter all; there are other families that find work for him now on\r\npurpose to annoy the Lensmand\'s; he is frequently called upon, for\r\ninstance, to drive for the doctor, and as for the parsonage, they\'d\r\ngladly send for Brede every time there\'s a pig to be killed, and\r\nmore--Brede says so himself.\r\n\r\nBut for all that there are hard times now and again in Brede\'s house;\r\n\'tis not all the family are as fat and flourishing as the dog. Still,\r\nHeaven be praised, Brede is not a man to take things much to heart.\r\n"Here\'s the children growing up day by day," says he, though, for that\r\nmatter, there\'s always new little ones coming to take their place. The\r\nones that are grown up and out in the world can keep themselves, and\r\nsend home a bit now and again. There\'s Barbro married at Maaneland,\r\nand Helge out at the herring fishery; they send home something in\r\nmoney or money\'s worth as often as they can; ay, even Katrine, doing\r\nwaiting at home, managed, strangely enough, to slip a five-_Krone_\r\nnote into her father\'s hand last winter, when things were looking\r\nextra bad. "There\'s a girl for you," said Brede, and never asked her\r\nwhere she\'d got the money, or what for. Ay, that was the way! Children\r\nwith a heart to think of their parents and help them in time of need!\r\n\r\nBrede is not altogether pleased with his boy Helge in that respect; he\r\ncan be heard at times standing in the store with a little group about\r\nhim, developing his theories as to children and their duty toward\r\ntheir parents. "Look you, now, my boy, Helge; if he smokes tobacco a\r\nbit, or takes a dram now and then, I\'ve nothing against that, we\'ve\r\nall been young in our time. But \'tis not right of him to go sending\r\none letter home after another and nothing but words and wishes in.\r\n\'Tis not right to set his mother crying. \'Tis the wrong road for a\r\nlad. In days gone by, things were different. Children were no sooner\r\ngrown than they went into service and started sending home a little to\r\nhelp. And quite right, too. Isn\'t it their father and mother had borne\r\nthem under their breast first of all, and sweating blood to keep the\r\nlife in them all their tender years? And then to forget it all!"\r\n\r\nIt almost seemed as if Helge had heard that speech of his father\'s,\r\nfor there came a letter from him after with money in--fifty _Kroner_,\r\nno less. And then Bredes had a great time; ay, in their endless\r\nextravagance they bought both meat and fish for dinner, and a lamp all\r\nhung about with lustres to hang from the ceiling in the best room.\r\n\r\nThey managed somehow, and what more could they ask? Bredes, they kept\r\nalive, lived from hand to mouth, but without great fear. What more\r\ncould they wish for?\r\n\r\n"Here\'s visitors indeed!" says Brede, showing Isak and Eleseus into\r\nthe room with the new lamp. "And I\'d never thought to see. Isak,\r\nyou\'re never going away yourself, and all?"\r\n\r\n"Nay, only to the smith\'s for something, \'tis no more."\r\n\r\n"Ho! \'Tis Eleseus, then, going off south again?"\r\n\r\nEleseus is used to hotels; he makes himself at hojne, hangs up his\r\ncoat and stick on the wall, and calls for coffee; as for something to\r\neat, his father has things in a basket. Katrine brings the coffee.\r\n\r\n"Pay? I\'ll not hear of it," says Brede. "I\'ve had many a bite and sup\r\nat Sellanraa; and as for Eleseus, I\'m in his books already. Don\'t take\r\nit, Katrine." But Eleseus pays all the same, takes out his purse and\r\npays out the money, and twenty _Ore_ over; no nonsense about him.\r\n\r\nIsak goes across to the smith\'s, and Eleseus stays where he is.\r\n\r\nHe says a few words, as in duty bound, to Katrine, but no more than is\r\nneeded; he would rather talk to her father. No, Eleseus cares nothing\r\nfor women; has been frightened off by them once, as it were, and takes\r\nno interest in them now. Like as not he\'d never much inclination\r\nthat way to speak of, seeing he\'s so completely out of it all now.\r\nA strange man to live in the wilds; a gentleman with thin writer\'s\r\nhands, and the sense of a woman for finery; for sticks and umbrellas\r\nand galoshes. Frightened off, and changed, incomprehensibly not a\r\nmarrying man. Even his upper lip declines to put forth any brutal\r\ndegree of growth. Yet it might be the lad had started well enough,\r\ncome of good stock, but been turned thereafter into an artificial\r\natmosphere, and warped, transformed? Had he worked so hard in an\r\noffice, in a shop, that his whole originality was lost thereby? Ay,\r\nmaybe \'twas so. Anyway, here he is now, easy and passionless, a little\r\nweak, a little heedless, wandering farther and farther off the road.\r\nHe might envy every soul among his fellows in the wilds, but has not\r\neven strength for that.\r\n\r\nKatrine is used to jesting with her customers, and asks him teasingly\r\nif he is off to see his sweetheart in the south again.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve other things to think of," says Eleseus. "I\'m out on\r\nbusiness--opening up connections."\r\n\r\n"No call to be so free with your betters, Katrine," says her father\r\nreprovingly. Oh, Brede Olsen is all respect towards Eleseus, mighty\r\nrespectful for him to be. And well he may, \'tis but wise of him,\r\nseeing he owes money up at Storborg, and here\'s his creditor before\r\nhim. And Eleseus? Ho, all this deference pleases him, and he is kind\r\nand gracious in return; calls Brede "My dear sir," in jest, and goes\r\non that way. He mentions that he has forgotten his umbrella: "Just as\r\nwe were passing Breidablik, I thought of it; left my umbrella behind."\r\n\r\nBrede asks: "You\'ll be going over to our little store this evening,\r\nbelike, for a drink?"\r\n\r\nSays Eleseus: "Ay, maybe, if \'twas only myself. But I\'ve my father\r\nhere."\r\n\r\nBrede makes himself pleasant, and goes on gossiping: "There\'s a fellow\r\ncoming in day after tomorrow that\'s on his way to America."\r\n\r\n"Been home, d\'you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Ay. He\'s from up in the village a bit. Been away for ever so many\r\nyears, and home for the winter. His trunk\'s come down already by\r\ncart--and a mighty fine trunk."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve thought of going to America myself once or twice," says Eleseus\r\nfrankly.\r\n\r\n"You?" cries Brede. "Why, there\'s little need for the likes of you\r\ngoing that way surely!"\r\n\r\n"Well, \'twas not going over to stay for ever I was thinking. But I\'ve\r\nbeen travelling about so many places now, I might just as well make\r\nthe trip over there."\r\n\r\n"Ay, of course, and why not? And a heap of money and means and all, so\r\nthey say, in America. Here\'s this fellow I spoke of before; he\'s paid\r\nfor more feasting and parties than\'s easy to count this winter past,\r\nand comes in here and says to me, \'Let\'s have some coffee, a potful,\r\nand all the cakes you\'ve got.\' Like to see his trunk?"\r\n\r\nThey went out in the passage to look at the trunk. A wonder to look\r\nat on earth, flaming all sides and corners with metal and clasps and\r\nbinding, and three flaps to hold it down, not to speak of a lock.\r\n"Burglar-proof," says Brede, as if he had tried it himself.\r\n\r\nThey went back into the room, but Eleseus was grown thoughtful. This\r\nAmerican from up in the village had outdone him; he was nothing beside\r\nsuch a man. Going out on journeys like any high official; ay, natural\r\nenough that Brede should make a fuss of him. Eleseus ordered more\r\ncoffee, and tried to play the rich man too; ordered cakes with his\r\ncoffee and gave them to the dog--and all the time feeling worthless\r\nand dejected. What was his trunk beside that wonder out there? There\r\nit stood, black canvas with the corners all rubbed and worn; a\r\nhandbag, nothing more--ho, but wait! He would buy a trunk when he got\r\nto the towns, a splendid one it should be, only wait!\r\n\r\n"\'Tis a pity to feed the dog so," says Brede.\r\n\r\nAnd Eleseus feels better at that, and ready to show off again. "\'Tis a\r\nmarvel how a beast can get so fat," says he.\r\n\r\nOne thought leading to another: Eleseus breaks off his talk with Brede\r\nand goes out into the shed to look at the horse. And there he takes\r\nout a letter from his pocket and opens it. He had put it away at once,\r\nnever troubling to look what money was in it; he had had letters\r\nof that sort from home before, and always a deal of notes\r\ninside--something to help him on the way. What was this? A big sheet\r\nof grey paper scrawled all over; little Rebecca to her brother\r\nEleseus, and a few words from his mother. What else? Nothing else. No\r\nmoney at all.\r\n\r\nHis mother wrote that she could not ask his father for more money\r\nagain now, for there was none too much left of all they had got for\r\nthe copper mine that time; the money had gone to buy Storborg, and pay\r\nfor all the goods after, and Eleseus\' travelling about. He must try\r\nand manage by himself this time, for the money that was left would\r\nhave to be kept for his brother and sisters, not to leave them all\r\nwithout. And a pleasant journey and your loving mother.\r\n\r\nNo money.\r\n\r\nEleseus himself had not enough for his fare; he had cleaned out the\r\ncash box at Storborg, and that was not much. Oh, but he had been a\r\nfool to send that money to the dealers in Bergen on account; no hurry\r\nfor that; he might have let it stand over. He ought, of course, to\r\nhave opened the letter before starting out at all; he might have saved\r\nhimself that journey down to the village with his miserable trunk and\r\nall. And here he was....\r\n\r\nHis father comes back from the smith\'s after settling his business\r\nthere; Jensine was to go back with him next morning. And Jensine, look\r\nyou, had been nowise contrary and hard to persuade, but saw at once\r\nthey wanted help at Sellanraa for the summer, and was ready to come. A\r\nproper way to do, again.\r\n\r\nWhile his father is talking, Eleseus sits thinking of his own affairs.\r\nHe shows him the American\'s trunk, and says: "Only wish I was where\r\nthat\'s come from."\r\n\r\nAnd his father answers: "Ay, \'twas none so bad, maybe."\r\n\r\nNext morning Isak gets ready to start for home again; has his food,\r\nputs in the horse and drives round by the smith\'s to fetch Jensine and\r\nher box. Eleseus stands looking after them as they go; then when they\r\nare lost to sight in the woods, he pays his score at the lodging-house\r\nagain, and something over. "You can leave my trunk here till I come\r\nback," he tells Katrine, and off he goes.\r\n\r\nEleseus--going where? Only one place to go; he turns back, going back\r\nhome again. So he too takes the road up over the hills again, taking\r\ncare to keep as near his father and Jensine as he can without being\r\nseen. Walks on and on. Beginning now to envy every soul of them in the\r\nwilds.\r\n\r\n\'Tis a pity about Eleseus, so changed he is and all.\r\n\r\nIs he doing no business at Storborg? Such as it is; nothing to make a\r\nfortune out of there, and Eleseus is overmuch out and abroad, making\r\npleasant journeys on business to open up connections, and it costs\r\ntoo much; he does not travel cheaply. "Doesn\'t do to be mean," says\r\nEleseus, and gives twenty _Ore_ over where he might save ten. The\r\nbusiness cannot support a man of his tastes, he must get subsidies\r\nfrom home. There\'s the farm at Storborg, with potatoes and corn and\r\nhay enough for the place itself, but all provisions else must come\r\nfrom Sellanraa. Is that all? Sivert must cart up his brother\'s goods\r\nfrom the steamer all for nothing. And is that all? His mother must get\r\nmoney out of his father to pay for his journeys. But is that all?\r\n\r\nThe worst is to come.\r\n\r\nEleseus manages his business like a fool. It flatters him to have folk\r\ncoming up from the village to buy at Storborg, so that he gives them\r\ncredit as soon as asked; and when this is noised abroad, there come\r\nstill more of them to buy the same way. The whole thing is going to\r\nrack and ruin. Eleseus is an easy man, and lets it go; the store is\r\nemptied and the store is filled again. All costs money. And who pays\r\nit? His father.\r\n\r\nAt first, his mother had been a faithful spokesman for him every way.\r\nEleseus was the clever head of the family; they must help him on and\r\ngive him a start; then think how cheaply he had got Storborg, and\r\nsaying straight out what he would give for it! When his father thought\r\nit was going wrong somehow with the business, and naught but foolery,\r\nshe took him up. "How can you stand there and say such things!"\r\nAy, she reproved him for using such words about his son; Isak was\r\nforgetting his place, it seemed, to speak so of Eleseus.\r\n\r\nFor look you, his mother had been out in the world herself; she\r\nunderstood how hard it was for Eleseus to live in the wilds, being\r\nused to better things, and accustomed to move in society, and with\r\nnone of his equals near. He risked too much in his dealings with folk\r\nthat were none of the soundest; but even so, \'twas not done with any\r\nevil intent on his part of ruining his parents, but sheer goodness of\r\nheart and noble nature; \'twas his way to help those that were not so\r\nfine and grand as himself. Why, wasn\'t he the only man in those parts\r\nto use white handkerchiefs that were always having to be washed? When\r\nfolk came trustingly to him and asked for credit, if he were to say\r\n"No," they might take it amiss, it might seem as if he were not the\r\nnoble fellow they had thought, after all. Also, he had a certain duty\r\ntowards his fellows, as the town-bred man, the genius among them all.\r\n\r\nAy, his mother bore all these things in mind.\r\n\r\nBut his father, never understanding it all in the least, opened her\r\neyes and ears one day and said:\r\n\r\n"Look you here. Here\'s all that is left of the money from that mine."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all?" said she. "And what\'s come of the rest?"\r\n\r\n"Eleseus, he\'s had the rest."\r\n\r\nAnd she clasped her hands at that and declared it was time Eleseus\r\nbegan to use his wits.\r\n\r\nPoor Eleseus, all set on end and frittered away. Better, maybe, if\r\nhe\'d worked on the land all the time, but now he\'s a man that has\r\nlearned to write and use letters; no grip in him, no depth. For all\r\nthat, no pitch-black devil of a man, not in love, not ambitious,\r\nhardly nothing at all is Eleseus, not even a bad thing of any great\r\ndimensions.\r\n\r\nSomething unfortunate, ill-fated about this young man, as if something\r\nwere rotting him from within. That engineer from the town, good\r\nman--better perhaps, if he had not discovered the lad in his youth\r\nand taken him up to make something out of him; the child had lost his\r\nroothold, and suffered thereby. All that he turns to now leads back to\r\nsomething wanting in him, something dark against the light....\r\n\r\nEleseus goes on and on. The two in the cart ahead pass by Storborg.\r\nEleseus goes a long way round, and he too passes by; what was he to do\r\nthere, at home, at his trading station and store? The two in the cart\r\nget to Sellanraa at nightfall; Eleseus is close at their heels. Sees\r\nSivert come out in the yard, all surprised to see Jensine, and the two\r\nshake hands and laugh a little; then Sivert takes the horse out and\r\nleads it to stable.\r\n\r\nEleseus ventures forward; the pride of the family, he ventures up a\r\nlittle. Not walking up, but stealing up; he comes on Sivert in the\r\nstable. "\'Tis only me," he says.\r\n\r\n"What--you too?" says Sivert, all astonished again.\r\n\r\nThe two brothers begin talking quietly; about Sivert getting his\r\nmother to find some money; a last resource, the money for a journey.\r\nThings can\'t go on this way; Eleseus is weary of it; has been thinking\r\nof it a long time now, and he must go tonight; a long journey, to\r\nAmerica, and start tonight.\r\n\r\n"America?" says Sivert out loud.\r\n\r\n"Sh! I\'ve been thinking of it a long time, and you must get her to do\r\nas I say; it can\'t go on like this, and I\'ve been thinking of going\r\nfor ever so long."\r\n\r\n"But America!" says Sivert. "No, don\'t you do it."\r\n\r\n"I\'m going. I\'ve settled that. Going back now to catch the boat."\r\n\r\n"But you must have something to eat."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not hungry."\r\n\r\n"But rest a bit, then?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\nSivert is trying to act for the best, and hold his brother back, but\r\nEleseus is determined, ay, for once he is determined. Sivert himself\r\nis all taken aback; first of all it was a surprise to see Jensine\r\nagain, and now here\'s Eleseus going to leave the place altogether, not\r\nto say the world. "What about Storborg?" says he. "What\'ll you do with\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"Andresen can have it," says Sivert.\r\n\r\n"Andresen have it? How d\'you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t he going to have Leopoldine?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know about that. Ay; perhaps he is."\r\n\r\nThey talk quietly, keep on talking. Sivert thinks it would be best if\r\nhis father came out and Eleseus could talk to him himself; but "No,\r\nno!" whispers Eleseus again; he was never much of a man to face a\r\nthing like that, but always must have a go-between.\r\n\r\nSays Sivert: "Well, mother, you know how \'tis with her. There\'ll be no\r\ngetting any way with her for crying and talking on. She mustn\'t know."\r\n\r\n"No," Eleseus agrees, "she mustn\'t know."\r\n\r\nSivert goes off, stays away for ages, and comes back with money,\r\na heap of money. "Here, that\'s all he has; think it\'ll be enough?\r\nCount--he didn\'t count how much there was."\r\n\r\n"What did he say--father?"\r\n\r\n"Nay, he didn\'t say much. Now you must wait a little, and I\'ll get\r\nsome more clothes on and go down with you."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis not worth while; you go and lie down."\r\n\r\n"Ho, are you frightened of the dark that I mustn\'t go away?" says\r\nSivert, trying a moment to be cheerful.\r\n\r\nHe is away a moment, and comes back dressed, and with his father\'s\r\nfood basket over his shoulder. As they go out, there is their father\r\nstanding outside. "So you\'re going all that way, seems?" says Isak.\r\n\r\n"Ay," answered Eleseus; "but I\'ll be coming back again."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll not be keeping you now--there\'s little time," mumbles the old\r\nman, and turns away. "Good luck," he croaks out in a strange voice,\r\nand goes off all hurriedly.\r\n\r\nThe two brothers walk down the road; a little way gone, they sit down\r\nto eat; Eleseus is hungry, can hardly eat enough. \'Tis a fine spring\r\nnight, and the black grouse at play on the hilltops; the homely sound\r\nmakes the emigrant lose courage for a moment. "\'Tis a fine night,"\r\nsays he. "You better turn back now, Sivert," says he.\r\n\r\n"H\'m," says Sivert, and goes on with him.\r\n\r\nThey pass by Storborg, by Breidablik, and the sound follows them all\r\nthe way from the hills here and there; \'tis no military music like\r\nin the towns, nay, but voices--a proclamation: Spring has come. Then\r\nsuddenly the first chirp of a bird is heard from a treetop, waking\r\nothers, and a calling and answering on every side; more than a song,\r\nit is a hymn of praise. The emigrant feels home-sick already, maybe,\r\nsomething weak and helpless in him; he is going off to America, and\r\nnone could be more fitted to go than he.\r\n\r\n"You turn back now, Sivert," says he.\r\n\r\n"Ay, well," says his brother. "If you\'d rather."\r\n\r\nThey sit down at the edge of the wood, and see the village just below\r\nthem, the store and the quay, Brede\'s old lodging-house; some men are\r\nmoving about by the steamer, getting ready.\r\n\r\n"Well, no time to stay sitting here," says Eleseus, getting up again.\r\n\r\n"Fancy you going all that way," says Sivert.\r\n\r\nAnd Eleseus answers: "But I\'ll be coming back again. And I\'ll have a\r\nbetter sort of trunk that journey."\r\n\r\nAs they say good-bye, Sivert thrusts something into his brother\'s\r\nhand, a bit of something wrapped in paper. "What is it?" asks Eleseus.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t forget to write often," says Sivert. And so he goes.\r\n\r\nEleseus opens the paper and looks; \'tis the gold piece, twenty-five\r\n_Kroner_ in gold. "Here, don\'t!" he calls out. "You mustn\'t do that!"\r\n\r\nSivert walks on.\r\n\r\nWalks on a little, then turns round and sits down again at the edge of\r\nthe wood. More folk astir now down by the steamer; passengers going on\r\nboard, Eleseus going on board; the boat pushes off from the side and\r\nrows away. And Eleseus is gone to America.\r\n\r\nHe never came back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII\r\n\r\n\r\nA notable procession coming up to Sellanraa; Something laughable to\r\nlook at, maybe, but more than that. Three men with enormous burdens,\r\nwith sacks hanging down from their shoulders, front and back. Walking\r\none behind the other, and calling to one another with jesting words,\r\nbut heavily laden. Little Andresen, chief clerk, is head of that\r\nprocession; indeed, \'tis his procession; he has fitted out himself,\r\nand Sivert from Sellanraa, and one other, Fredrik Stroem from\r\nBreidablik, for the expedition. A notable little man is Andresen; his\r\nshoulder is weighed down slantwise on one side, and his jacket pulled\r\nall awry at the neck, the way he goes, but he carries his burden on\r\nand on.\r\n\r\nStorborg and the business Eleseus had left--well, not bought it\r\nstraight out on the spot, perhaps, \'tis more than Andresen could\r\nafford; better afford to wait a bit and get the whole maybe for\r\nnothing. Andresen is no fool; he has taken over the place on lease for\r\nthe meanwhile, and manages the business himself.\r\n\r\nGone through the stock in hand, and found a deal of unsalable truck in\r\nEleseus\' store, even to such things as toothbrushes and embroidered\r\ntable centres; ay, and stuffed birds on springs that squeaked when you\r\npressed in the right place.\r\n\r\nThese are the things he has started out with now, going to sell them\r\nto the miners on the other side of the hills. He knows from Aronsen\'s\r\ntime that miners with money in their pockets will buy anything on\r\nearth. Only a pity he had to leave behind six rocking-horses that\r\nEleseus had ordered on his last trip to Bergen.\r\n\r\nThe caravan turns into the yard at Sellanraa and sets down its load.\r\nNo long wait here; they drink a mug of milk, and make pretence of\r\ntrying to sell their wares on the spot, then shoulder their burdens\r\nand off again. They are not out for pretence. Off they go, trundling\r\nsouthward through the forest.\r\n\r\nThey march till noon, rest for a meal and on again till evening. Then\r\nthey camp and make a fire, lie down, and sleep a while. Sivert sleeps\r\nresting on a boulder that he calls an arm-chair. Oh, Sivert knows what\r\nhe is about; here\'s the sun been warming that boulder all day, till\r\nit\'s a good place to sit and sleep. His companions are not so wise,\r\nand will not take advice; they lie down in the heather, and wake up\r\nfeeling cold, and sneezing. Then they have breakfast and start off\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nListening now, for any sound of blasting about; they are hoping to\r\ncome on the mine, and meet with folk some time that day. The work\r\nshould have got so far by now; a good way up from the water towards\r\nSellanraa. But never a sound of blasting anywhere. They march till\r\nnoon, meeting never a soul; but here and there they come upon holes in\r\nthe ground, where men have been digging for trial. What can this mean?\r\nMeans, no doubt, that the ore must be more than commonly rich at the\r\nfarther end of the tract; they are getting out pure heavy copper, and\r\nkeeping to that end all the time.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon they come upon several more mines, but no miners;\r\nthey march on till evening, and already they can make out the sea\r\nbelow; marching through a wilderness of deserted mines, and never a\r\nsound. \'Tis all beyond understanding, but nothing for it; they must\r\ncamp and sleep out again that night. They talk the matter over: Can\r\nthe work have stopped? Should they turn and go back again? "Not a bit\r\nof it," says Andresen.\r\n\r\nNext morning a man walks into their camp--a pale, haggard man who\r\nlooks at them frowningly, piercingly. "That you, Andresen?" says the\r\nman. It is Aronsen, Aronsen the trader. He does not say "No" to a cup\r\nof hot coffee and something to eat with the caravan, and settles down\r\nat once. "I saw the smoke of your fire, and came up to see what it\r\nwas," says he. "I said to myself, \'Sure enough, they\'re coming to\r\ntheir senses, and starting work again.\' And \'twas only you, after all!\r\nWhere you making for, then?"\r\n\r\n"Here."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that you\'ve got with you?"\r\n\r\n"Goods."\r\n\r\n"Goods?" cries Aronsen. "Coming up here with goods for sale? Who\'s to\r\nbuy them? There\'s never a soul. They left last Saturday gone."\r\n\r\n"Left? Who left?"\r\n\r\n"All the lot. Not a soul on the place now. And I\'ve goods enough\r\nmyself, anyway. A whole store packed full. I\'ll sell you anything you\r\nlike."\r\n\r\nOh, Trader Aronsen in difficulties again! The mine has shut down.\r\n\r\nThey ply him with coffee till he grows calmer, and asks what it all\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nAronsen shakes his head despairingly. "\'Tis beyond understanding,\r\nthere\'s no words for it," says he. All had been going so well, and he\r\nhad been selling goods, and money pouring in; the village round all\r\nflourishing, and using the finest meal, and a new schoolhouse, and\r\nhanging lamps and town-made boots, and all! Then suddenly their\r\nlordships up at the mine take it into their heads that the thing isn\'t\r\npaying, and close down. Not paying? But it paid them before? Wasn\'t\r\nthere clean copper there and plain to see at every blasting? \'Twas\r\nrank cheating, no less. "And never a thought of what it means to a man\r\nlike me. Ay, I doubt it\'s as they say; \'tis that Geissler\'s at the\r\nbottom of it all, same as before. No sooner he\'d come up than the work\r\nstopped; \'twas as if he\'d smelt it out somehow."\r\n\r\n"Geissler, is he here, then?"\r\n\r\n"Is he not? Ought to be shot, he ought! Comes up one day by the\r\nsteamer and says to the engineer: \'Well, how\'s things going?\'--\'All\r\nright, as far as I can see,\' says the engineer. But Geissler he just\r\nstands there, and asks again: \'Ho, all right, is it?\'--\'Ay, as far as\r\nI know,\' says the engineer. But as true as I\'m here, no sooner the\r\npost comes up from that same boat Geissler had come by, than there\'s\r\nletter and telegram both to the engineer that the work wasn\'t paying,\r\nand he\'s to shut down at once."\r\n\r\nThe members of the expedition look at one another, but the leader,\r\nAndresen himself, has not lost courage yet.\r\n\r\n"You may just as well turn back and go home again," is Aronsen\'s\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\n"We\'re not doing that," says Andresen, and packs up the coffee-pot.\r\n\r\nAronsen stares at the three of them in turn. "You\'re mad, then," says\r\nhe.\r\n\r\nLook you, Andresen he cares little now for what his master that was\r\ncan say; he\'s master himself now, leader of an expedition equipped at\r\nhis own expense for a journey to distant parts; \'twould lose him his\r\nprestige to turn back now where he is.\r\n\r\n"Well, where will you go?" asks Aronsen irritably.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t say," answers Andresen. But he\'s a notion of his own all the\r\nsame, no doubt; thinking, maybe, of the natives, and coming down into\r\nthe district three men strong, with glass beads and finger rings.\r\n"We\'ll be getting on," says he to the rest.\r\n\r\nNow, Aronsen had thought like enough to go farther up that morning,\r\nseeing he\'d come so far, wanting, maybe, to see if all the place was\r\nquite deserted, if it could be true every man on the place was gone.\r\nBut seeing these pedlar-folk so set on going on, it hinders him, and\r\nhe tells them again and again they\'re mad to try. Aronsen is furious\r\nhimself, marches down in front of the caravan, turning round and\r\nshouting at them, barking at them, trying to keep them out of his\r\ndistrict. And so they come down to the huts in the mining centre.\r\n\r\nA little town of huts, but empty and desolate. Most of the tools and\r\nimplements are housed under cover, but poles and planks, broken carts\r\nand cases and barrels, lie all about in disorder; here and there a\r\nnotice on a door declares "No admittance."\r\n\r\n"There you are," cries Aronsen. "What did I say? Not a soul in the\r\nplace." And he threatens the caravan with disaster--he will send for\r\nthe Lensmand; anyway, he\'s going to follow them every step now, and\r\nif he can catch them at any unlawful trading \'tis penal servitude and\r\nslavery, no mistake!\r\n\r\nAll at once somebody calls out for Sivert. The place is not altogether\r\ndead, after all, not utterly deserted; here is a man standing\r\nbeckoning at the corner of a house. Sivert trundles over with his\r\nload, and sees at once who it is--Geissler.\r\n\r\n"Funny meeting you here," says Geissler. His face is red and\r\nflourishing, but his eyes apparently cannot stand the glare of spring,\r\nhe is wearing smoked glasses. He talks as brilliantly as ever.\r\n"Luckiest thing in the world," says he. "Save me going all the way up\r\nto Sellanraa; and I\'ve a deal to look after. How many settlers are\r\nthere in the _Almenning_ now?"\r\n\r\n"Ten."\r\n\r\n"Ten new holdings. I\'ll agree. I\'m satisfied. But \'tis\r\ntwo-and-thirty-thousand men of your father\'s stamp the country wants.\r\nAy, that\'s what I say, and I mean it; I\'ve reckoned it out."\r\n\r\n"Sivert, are you coming on?" The caravan is waiting.\r\n\r\nGeissler hears, and calls back sharply: "No."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come on after," calls Sivert, and sets down his load.\r\n\r\nThe two men sit down and talk. Geissler is in the right mood today;\r\nthe spirit moves him, and he talks all the time, only pausing when\r\nSivert puts in a word or so in answer, and then going on again. "A\r\nmighty lucky thing--can\'t help saying it. Everything turned out just\r\nas I wanted all the way up, and now meeting you here and saving all\r\nthe journey to Sellanraa. All well at home, what?"\r\n\r\n"All well, and thank you kindly."\r\n\r\n"Got up that hayloft yet, over the cowshed?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, \'tis done."\r\n\r\n"Well, well--I\'ve a heap of things to look to, almost more than I can\r\nmanage. Look at where we\'re sitting now, for instance. What d\'you say\r\nto that, Sivert man? Ruined city, eh? Men gone about to build it all\r\nagainst their nature and well-being. Properly speaking, it\'s all\r\nmy fault from the start--that is to say, I\'m a humble agent in the\r\nworkings of fate. It all began when your father picked up some bits\r\nof stone up in the hills, and gave you to play with when you were a\r\nchild. That was how it started. I knew well enough those bits of stone\r\nwere worth exactly as much as men would give for them, no more; well\r\nand good, I set a price on them myself, and bought them. Then the\r\nstones passed from hand to hand, and did no end of damage. Time went\r\non. And now, a few days ago, I came up here again, and what for, d\'you\r\nthink? To buy those stones back again!"\r\n\r\nGeissler stops for a moment, and looks at Sivert. Then suddenly he\r\nglances at the sack, and asks: "What\'s that you\'re carrying?"\r\n\r\n"Goods," says Sivert. "We\'re taking them down to the village."\r\n\r\nGeissler does not seem interested in the answer; has not even heard\r\nit, like as not. He goes on:\r\n\r\n"Buy them back again--yes. Last time, I let my son manage the deal; he\r\nsold them then. Young fellow about your own age, that\'s all about him.\r\nHe\'s the lightning in the family, I\'m more a sort of fog. Know what\'s\r\nthe right thing to do, but don\'t do it. But he\'s the lightning--and\r\nhe\'s entered the service of industry for the time being. \'Twas he sold\r\nfor me last time. I\'m something and he\'s not, he\'s only the lightning;\r\nquick to act, modern type. But the lightning by itself\'s a barren\r\nthing. Look at you folk at Sellanraa, now; looking up at blue peaks\r\nevery day of your lives; no new-fangled inventions about that, but\r\nfjeld and rocky peaks, rooted deep in the past--but you\'ve them for\r\ncompanionship. There you are, living in touch with heaven and earth,\r\none with them, one with all these wide, deep-rooted things. No need of\r\na sword in your hands, you go through life bareheaded, barehanded, in\r\nthe midst of a great kindliness. Look, Nature\'s there, for you and\r\nyours to have and enjoy. Man and Nature don\'t bombard each other,\r\nbut agree; they don\'t compete, race one against the other, but go\r\ntogether. There\'s you Sellanraa folk, in all this, living there. Fjeld\r\nand forest, moors and meadow, and sky and stars--oh, \'tis not poor and\r\nsparingly counted out, but without measure. Listen to me, Sivert: you\r\nbe content! You\'ve everything to live on, everything to live for,\r\neverything to believe in; being born and bringing forth, you are the\r\nneedful on earth. \'Tis not all that are so, but you are so; needful on\r\nearth. \'Tis you that maintain life. Generation to generation, breeding\r\never anew; and when you die, the new stock goes on. That\'s the meaning\r\nof eternal life. What do you get out of it? An existence innocently\r\nand properly set towards all. What you get out of it? Nothing can put\r\nyou under orders and lord it over you Sellanraa folk, you\'ve peace and\r\nauthority and this great kindliness all round. That\'s what you get for\r\nit. You lie at a mother\'s breast and suck, and play with a mother\'s\r\nwarm hand. There\'s your father now, he\'s one of the two-and-thirty\r\nthousand. What\'s to be said of many another? I\'m something, I\'m the\r\nfog, as it were, here and there, floating around, sometimes coming\r\nlike rain on dry ground. But the others? There\'s my son, the lightning\r\nthat\'s nothing in itself, a flash of barrenness; he can act.\r\n\r\n"My son, ay, he\'s the modern type, a man of our time; he believes\r\nhonestly enough all the age has taught him, all the Jew and the Yankee\r\nhave taught him; I shake my head at it all. But there\'s nothing\r\nmythical about me; \'tis only in the family, so to speak, that I\'m like\r\na fog. Sit there shaking my head. Tell the truth--I\'ve not the power\r\nof doing things and not regretting it. If I had, I could be lightning\r\nmyself. Now I\'m a fog."\r\n\r\nSuddenly Geissler seems to recollect himself, and asks: "Got up that\r\nhayloft yet, above the cowshed?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, that\'s done. And father\'s put up a new house."\r\n\r\n"New house?"\r\n\r\n"\'Tis in case any one should come, he says--in case Geissler he should\r\nhappen to come along."\r\n\r\nGeissler thinks over this, and takes his decision: "Well, then, I\'d\r\nbetter come. Yes, I\'ll come; you can tell your father that. But I\'ve a\r\nheap of things to look to. Came up here and told the engineer to\r\nlet his people in Sweden know I was ready to buy. And we\'d see what\r\nhappened. All the same to me, no hurry. You ought to have seen that\r\nengineer--here he\'s been going about and keeping it all up with men\r\nand horses and money and machines and any amount of fuss; thought it\r\nwas all right, knew no better. The more bits of stone he can turn\r\ninto money, the better; he thinks he\'s doing something clever and\r\ndeserving, bringing money to the place, to the country, and everything\r\nnearing disaster more and more, and he\'s none the wiser. \'Tis not\r\nmoney the country wants, there\'s more than enough of it already; \'tis\r\nmen like your father there\'s not enough of. Ay, turning the means to\r\nan end in itself and being proud of it! They\'re mad, diseased; they\r\ndon\'t work, they know nothing of the plough, only the dice. Mighty\r\ndeserving of them, isn\'t it, working and wasting themselves to nothing\r\nin their own mad way. Look at them--staking everything, aren\'t they?\r\nThere\'s but this much wrong with it all; they forget that gambling\r\nisn\'t courage, \'tis not even foolhardy courage, \'tis a horror. D\'you\r\nknow what gambling is? \'Tis fear, with the sweat on your brow, that\'s\r\nwhat it is. What\'s wrong with them is, they won\'t keep pace with life,\r\nbut want to go faster--race on, tear on ahead, driving themselves into\r\nlife itself like wedges. And then the flanks of them say: here, stop,\r\nthere\'s something breaking, find a remedy; stop, say the flanks! And\r\nthen life crushes them, politely but firmly crushes them. And then\r\nthey set to complaining about life, raging against life! Each to his\r\nown taste; some may have ground to complain, others not, but there\'s\r\nnone should rage against life. Not be stern and strict and just with\r\nlife, but be merciful to it, and take its part; only think of the\r\ngamblers life has to bear with!"\r\n\r\nGeissler recollects himself again, and says: "Well, all that\'s as it\r\nmay be; leave it!" He is evidently tired, beginning to breathe in\r\nlittle gasps. "Going down?" says he.\r\n\r\n"Ay."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no hurry. You owe me a long walk over the hills, Sivert man,\r\nremember that? I remember it all. I remember from the time I was a\r\nyear and a half; stood leaning down from the barn bridge at Garmo, and\r\nnoticed a smell. I can smell it again now. But all that\'s as it may\r\nbe, that too; but we might have done that trip over the hills now if\r\nyou hadn\'t got that sack. What\'s in it?"\r\n\r\n"Goods. \'Tis Andresen is going to sell them."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I\'m a man that knows what\'s the right thing to do, but\r\ndoesn\'t do it," says Geissler. "I\'m the fog. Now perhaps I\'ll buy that\r\nmine back again one of these days, it\'s not impossible; but if I do,\r\nit wouldn\'t be to go about staring up at the sky and saying, \'Aerial\r\nrailway! South America!\' No, leave that to the gamblers. Folk\r\nhereabout say I must be the devil himself because I knew beforehand\r\nthis was going to break up. But there\'s nothing mystical about me,\r\n\'tis simple enough. The new copper mines in Montana, that\'s all. The\r\nYankees are smarter than we are at that game; they are cutting us\r\nto death in South America--our ore here\'s too poor. My son\'s the\r\nlightning; he got the news, and I came floating up here. Simple, isn\'t\r\nit? I beat those fellows in Sweden by a few hours, that\'s all."\r\n\r\nGeissler is short of breath again; he gets on his feet, and says: "If\r\nyou\'re going down, let\'s get along."\r\n\r\nThey go on down together, Geissler dragging behind, all tired out. The\r\ncaravan has stopped at the quay, and Fredrik Stroem, cheerful as ever,\r\nis poking fun at Aronsen: "I\'m clean out of tobacco; got any tobacco,\r\nwhat?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll give you tobacco," said Aronsen threateningly.\r\n\r\nFredrik laughs, and says comfortingly: "Nay, you\'ve no call to take it\r\nall heavy-like and sad, Aronsen. We\'re just going to sell these things\r\nhere before your eyes, and then we\'ll be off home again."\r\n\r\n"Get away and wash your dirty mouth," says Aronsen furiously.\r\n\r\n"Ha ha ha! Nay, you\'ve no call to dance about that way; keep still and\r\nlook like a picture!"\r\n\r\nGeissler is tired, tired out, even his smoked glasses do not help him\r\nnow, his eyes keep closing in the glare.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Sivert man," says he all at once. "No, I can\'t get up to\r\nSellanraa this time, after all; tell your father. I\'ve a heap of\r\nthings to see to. But I\'ll come later on--say that...."\r\n\r\nAronsen spits after him, and says: "Ought to be shot!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor three days the caravan peddles its wares, selling out the contents\r\nof the sacks, and getting good prices. It was a brilliant piece of\r\nbusiness. The village folk were still well supplied with money after\r\nthe downfall of the mine, and were excellently in form in the way of\r\nspending; those stuffed birds on springs were the very thing they\r\nwanted; they set them up on chests of drawers in their parlours, and\r\nalso bought nice paper-knives, the very thing for cutting the leaves\r\nof an almanac. Aronsen was furious. "Just as if I hadn\'t things every\r\nbit as good in my store," said he.\r\n\r\nTrader Aronsen was in a sorry way; he had made up his mind to keep\r\nwith these pedlars and their sacks, watching them all the time; but\r\nthey went separate ways about the village, each for himself, and\r\nAronsen almost tore himself to pieces trying to follow all at once.\r\nFirst he gave up Fredrik Stroem, who was quickest at saying unpleasant\r\nthings; then Sivert, because he never said a word, but went on\r\nselling; at last he stuck to following his former clerk, and trying to\r\nset folk against him wherever he went in. Oh, but Andresen knew his\r\nmaster that was--knew him of old, and how little he knew of business\r\nand unlawful trading.\r\n\r\n"Ho, you mean to say English thread\'s not prohibited?" said Aronsen,\r\nlooking wise.\r\n\r\n"I know it is," answered Andresen. "But I\'m not carrying any this\r\nway; I can sell that elsewhere. I haven\'t a reel in my pack; look for\r\nyourself, if you like."\r\n\r\n"That\'s as it may be," says Aronsen. "Anyway, I know what\'s forbidden,\r\nand I\'ve shown you, so don\'t try to teach me."\r\n\r\nAronsen stood it for a whole day, then he gave up Andresen, too, and\r\nwent home. The pedlars had no one to watch them after that.\r\n\r\nAnd then things began to go swimmingly. It was in the day when\r\nwomenfolk used to wear loose plaits in their hair; and Andresen, he\r\nwas the man to sell loose plaits. Ay, at a pinch he could sell fair\r\nplaits to dark girls, and be sorry he\'d nothing lighter; no grey\r\nplaits, for instance, for that was the finest of all. And every\r\nevening the three young salesmen met at an appointed place and went\r\nover the day\'s trade, each borrowing from another anything he\'d sold\r\nout of; and Andresen would sit down, often as not, and take out a file\r\nand file away the German trade-mark from a sportsman\'s whistle, or rub\r\nout "Faber" on the pens and pencils. Andresen was a trump, and always\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\nSivert, on the other hand, was rather a disappointment. Not that he\r\nwas any way slack, and failed to sell his goods--\'twas he, indeed,\r\nsold most--but he did not get enough for them. "You don\'t put in\r\nenough patter with it," said Andresen.\r\n\r\nNo, Sivert was no hand at reeling off a lot of talk; he was a\r\nfieldworker, sure of what he said, and speaking calmly when he spoke\r\nat all. What was there to talk about here? Also, Sivert was anxious to\r\nbe done with it and get back home, there was work to do in the fields.\r\n\r\n"Tis that Jensine\'s calling him," Fredrik Stroem explained. Fredrik,\r\nhimself, by the way, had work on his own fields to be done that\r\nspring, and little time to waste; but for all that, he must look in on\r\nAronsen the last day and get up an argument with him. "I\'ll sell him\r\nthe empty sacks," said he.\r\n\r\nAndresen and Sivert stayed outside while he went in. They heard grand\r\ngoings-on inside the store, both talking at once, and Fredrik setting\r\nup a laugh now and again; then Aronsen threw open the door and showed\r\nhis visitor out. Oh, but Fredrik didn\'t come out--no, he took his\r\ntime, and talked a lot more. The last thing they heard from outside\r\nwas Fredrik trying to sell Aronsen a lot of rocking-horses.\r\n\r\nThen the caravan went home again--three young men full of life and\r\nhealth. They marched and sang, slept a few hours in the open, and went\r\non again. When they got back to Sellanraa on the Monday, Isak had\r\nbegun sowing. The weather was right for it; the air moist, with the\r\nsun peeping out now and again, and a mighty rainbow strung right\r\nacross the heavens.\r\n\r\nThe caravan broke up--_Farvel, Farvel_....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIsak at his sowing; a stump of a man, a barge of a man to look at,\r\nnothing more. Clad in homespun--wool from his own sheep, boots from\r\nthe hide of his own cows and calves. Sowing--and he walks religiously\r\nbareheaded to that work; his head is bald just at the very top, but\r\nall the rest of him shamefully hairy; a fan, a wheel of hair and\r\nbeard, stands out from his face. \'Tis Isak, the Margrave.\r\n\r\n\'Twas rarely he knew the day of the month--what need had he of that?\r\nHe had no bills to be met on a certain date; the marks on his almanac\r\nwere to show the time when each of the cows should bear. But he knew\r\nSt. Olaf\'s Day in the autumn, that by then his hay must be in, and he\r\nknew Candlemas in spring, and that three weeks after then the bears\r\ncame out of their winter quarters; all seed must be in the earth by\r\nthen. He knew what was needful.\r\n\r\nA tiller of the ground, body and soul; a worker on the land without\r\nrespite. A ghost risen out of the past to point the future, a man from\r\nthe earliest days of cultivation, a settler in the wilds, nine hundred\r\nyears old, and, withal, a man of the day.\r\n\r\nNay, there was nothing left to him now of the copper mine and its\r\nriches--the money had vanished into air. And who had anything left of\r\nall that wealth when the working stopped, and the hills lay dead and\r\ndeserted? But the _Almenning_ was there still, and ten new holdings on\r\nthat land, beckoning a hundred more.\r\n\r\nNothing growing there? All things growing there; men and beasts and\r\nfruit of the soil. Isak sowing his corn. The evening sunlight falls on\r\nthe corn that flashes out in an arc from his hand, and falls like a\r\ndropping of gold to the ground. Here comes Sivert to the harrowing;\r\nafter that the roller, and then the harrow again. Forest and field\r\nlook on. All is majesty and power--a sequence and purpose of things.\r\n\r\n_Kling_ ... _eling_ ... say the cow bells far up on the hillside,\r\ncoming nearer and nearer; the cattle are coming home for the night.\r\nFifteen head of them, and five-and-forty sheep and goats besides;\r\nthreescore in all. There go the women out with their milk-pails,\r\ncarried on yokes from the shoulder: Leopoldine, Jensine, and little\r\nRebecca. All three barefooted. The Margravine, Inger herself, is not\r\nwith them; she is indoors preparing the meal. Tall and stately, as she\r\nmoves about her house, a Vestal tending the fire of a kitchen stove.\r\nInger has made her stormy voyage, \'tis true, has lived in a city a\r\nwhile, but now she is home; the world is wide, swarming with tiny\r\nspecks--Inger has been one of them. All but nothing in all humanity,\r\nonly one speck.\r\n\r\nThen comes the evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKnut Hamsun\r\n\r\n_by_\r\n\r\nW.W. Worster\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKnut Hamsun [Footnote: December, 1920.]\r\n\r\nBy W.W. Worster\r\n\r\nKnut Hamsun is now sixty. For years past he has been regarded as the\r\ngreatest of living Norwegian writers, but he is still little known in\r\nEngland. One or two attempts have been made previously to introduce\r\nHamsun\'s work into this country, but it was not until this year, with\r\nthe publication of _Growth of the Soil_, that he achieved any real\r\nsuccess, or became at all generally known, among English readers.\r\n\r\n_Growth of the Soil_ (Markens Groede) is Hamsun\'s latest work. Its\r\nreception here was one of immediate and unstinted appreciation,\r\nsuch as is rarely accorded to a translated work by an alien author\r\npractically unknown even to the critics. A noticeable feature was the\r\nfrankness with which experienced bookmen laid aside stock phrases, and\r\ndealt with this book as in response to a strong personal appeal. To\r\nthe reviewer, aged with much knowledge, hardened by much handling of\r\nmediocrity, it is a relief to meet with a book that can and must be\r\ndealt with so.\r\n\r\nThose readers are, perhaps, most fortunate who come upon such a book\r\nas this without foretaste or preparation. To the mind under spell of\r\nan aesthetic or emotional appeal, the steps that went to make it, the\r\nstages whereby the author passed, are as irrelevant as the logarithms\r\nthat went to build an aeroplane. Yet it is only by knowledge of such\r\nsteps that the achievement can be fully understood.\r\n\r\n_Growth of the Soil_ is very far indeed from Hamsun\'s earliest\r\nbeginnings: far even from the books of his early middle period, which\r\nmade his name. It is the life story of a man in the wilds, the genesis\r\nand gradual development of a homestead, the unit of humanity, in\r\nthe unfilled, uncleared tracts that still remain in the Norwegian\r\nHighlands. It is an epic of earth; the history of a microcosm. Its\r\ndominant note is one of patient strength and simplicity; the mainstay\r\nof its working is the tacit, stern, yet loving alliance between Nature\r\nand the Man who faces her himself, trusting to himself and her for the\r\nphysical means of life, and the spiritual contentment with life which\r\nshe must grant if he be worthy. Modern man faces Nature only by proxy,\r\nor as proxy, through others or for others, and the intimacy is lost.\r\nIn the wilds the contact is direct and immediate; it is the foothold\r\nupon earth, the touch of the soil itself, that gives strength.\r\n\r\nThe story is epic in its magnitude, in its calm, steady progress and\r\nunhurrying rhythm, in its vast and intimate humanity. The author looks\r\nupon his characters with a great, all-tolerant sympathy, aloof yet\r\nkindly, as a god. A more objective work of fiction it would be hard to\r\nfind--certainly in what used to be called "the neurasthenic North."\r\n\r\nAnd this from the pen of the man who wrote _Sult_, _Mysterier_, and\r\n_Pan_.\r\n\r\nHamsun\'s early work was subjective in the extreme; so much so, indeed,\r\nas almost to lie outside the limits of aesthetic composition. As a boy\r\nhe wrote verse under difficulties--he was born in Gudbrandsdalen, but\r\ncame as a child to Bodoe in Lofoten, and worked with a shoemaker there\r\nfor some years, saving up money for the publication of his juvenile\r\nefforts. He had little education to speak of, and after a period of\r\nvarying casual occupations, mostly of the humblest sort, he came to\r\nChristiania with the object of studying there, but failed to make his\r\nway. Twice he essayed his fortune in America, but without success. For\r\nthree years he worked as a fisherman on the Newfoundland Banks.\r\n\r\nHis Nordland origin is in itself significant; it means an environment\r\nof month-long nights and concentrated summers, in which all feelings\r\nare intensified, and love and dread and gratitude and longing are\r\nnearer and deeper than in milder and more temperate regions, where\r\nelemental opposites are, as it were, reciprocally diluted.\r\n\r\nIn 1890, at the age of thirty, Hamsun attracted attention by the\r\npublication of _Sult_ (Hunger). _Sult_ is a record of weeks of\r\nstarvation in a city; the semi-delirious confession of a man whose\r\nphysical and mental faculties have slipped beyond control. He speaks\r\nand acts irrationally, and knows it, watches himself at his mental\r\nantics and takes himself to task for the same. And he asks himself: Is\r\nit a sign of madness?\r\n\r\nIt might seem so. The extraordinary associations, the weird fancies\r\nand bizarre impulses that are here laid bare give an air of convincing\r\nverisimilitude to the supposed confessions of a starving journalist.\r\nBut, as a matter of fact, Hamsun has no need of extraneous influences\r\nto invest his characters with originality. Starving or fed, they can\r\nbe equally erratic. This is seen in his next book, _Mysterier_.\r\n\r\nHere we have actions and reactions as fantastic as in _Sult_,\r\nthough the hero has here no such excuse as in the former case. The\r\n"mysteries," or mystifications, of Nagel, a stranger who comes, for no\r\nparticular reason apparent, to stay in a little Norwegian town, arise\r\nentirely out of Nagel\'s own personality.\r\n\r\n_Mysterier_ is one of the most exasperating books that a publisher\'s\r\nreader, or a conscientious reviewer, could be given to deal with. An\r\nanalysis of the principal character is a most baffling task. One is\r\ntempted to call him mad, and have done with it. But, as a matter of\r\nfact, he is uncompromisingly, unrestrainedly human; he goes about\r\nconstantly saying and doing things that we, ordinary and respectable\r\npeople, are trained and accustomed to refrain from saying or doing at\r\nall. He has the self-consciousness of a sensitive child; he is for\r\never thinking of what people think of him, and trying to create an\r\nimpression. Then, with a paradoxical sincerity, he confesses that the\r\nmotive of this or that action _was_ simply to create an impression,\r\nand thereby destroys the impression. Sometimes he caps this by\r\nwilfully letting it appear that the double move was carefully designed\r\nto produce the reverse impression of the first--until the person\r\nconcerned is utterly bewildered, and the reader likewise.\r\n\r\n_Mysterier_ appeared in 1893. In the following year Hamsun astonished\r\nhis critics with two books, _Ny Jord_ (New Ground) and _Redaktoer\r\nLynge_, both equally unlike his previous work. With these he passes at\r\na bound from one-man stories, portrait studies of eccentric characters\r\nin a remote or restricted environment, to group subjects, chosen\r\nfrom centres of life and culture in Christiania. _Redaktoer\r\nLynge_--_redaktoer_, of course, means "editor"--deals largely with\r\npolitical manoeuvres and intrigues, the bitter controversial politics\r\nof Norway prior to the dissolution of the Union with Sweden. _Ny Jord_\r\ngives an unflattering picture of the academic, literary, and\r\nartistic youth of the capital, idlers for the most part, arrogant,\r\nunscrupulous, self-important, and full of disdain for the mere\r\ncitizens and merchants whose simple honesty and kindliness are laughed\r\nat or exploited by the newly dominant representatives of culture.\r\n\r\nBoth these books are technically superior to the first two, inasmuch\r\nas they show mastery of a more difficult form. But their appeal is\r\nnot so great; there is lacking a something that might be inspiration,\r\npersonal sympathy--some indefinable essential that the author himself\r\nhas taught us to expect. They are less _hamsunsk_ than most of\r\nHamsun\'s work. Hamsun is at his best among the scenes and characters\r\nhe loves; tenderness and sympathy make up so great a part of his charm\r\nthat he is hardly recognizable in surroundings or society uncongenial\r\nto himself.\r\n\r\nIt would almost seem as if he realized something of this. For in his\r\nnext work he turns from the capital to the Nordland coast, reverting\r\nalso, in some degree, to the subjective, keenly sensitive manner of\r\n_Sult_, though now with more restraint and concentration.\r\n\r\n_Pan_ (1894) is probably Hamsun\'s best-known work. It is a love-story,\r\nbut of an extraordinary type, and is, moreover, important from the\r\nfact that we are here introduced to some of the characters and types\r\nthat are destined to reappear again and again in his later works.\r\n\r\nNagel, the exasperating irresponsible of _Mysterier_, is at his\r\nmaddest in his behaviour towards the woman he loves. It is natural\r\nthat this should be so. When a man is intoxicated his essential\r\nqualities are emphasized. If he have wit, he will be witty; if a\r\nbrutal nature, he will be a brute; if he be of a melancholy temper, he\r\nwill be disposed to sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the\r\ndeath of kings.\r\n\r\nWe see this in _Pan_. The love-making of the hero is characterized\r\nby the same irrational impulses, the same extravagant actions, as\r\nin _Sult_ and _Mysterier_. But they are now less frequent and less\r\ninvolved. The book as a whole is toned down, so to speak, from the\r\nbewildering tangle of unrestraint in the first two. There is quite\r\nsufficient of the erratic and unusual in the character of Glahn, the\r\nhero, but the tone is more subdued. The madcap youth of genius has\r\nrealized that the world looks frigidly at its vagaries, and the\r\nsecretly proud "_au moins_ je suis autre"--more a boast than a\r\nconfession--gives place to a wistful, apologetic admission of the\r\ndifference as a fault. Here already we have something of that\r\nresignation which comes later to its fulness in the story of the\r\nWanderer with the Mute.\r\n\r\nThe love-story in _Pan_ takes the form of a conflict; it is one of\r\nthose battles between the sexes, duels of wit and _esprit_, such as\r\none finds in the plays of Marivaux. But Hamsun sets his battle in the\r\nsign of the heart, not of the head; it is a _marivaudage_ of feeling,\r\nnone the less deep for its erratic utterance. Moreover, the scene is\r\nlaid, not in salons and ante-chambers, but in a landscape such as\r\nHamsun loves, the forest-clad hills above a little fishing village,\r\nbetween the _hoeifjeld_ and the sea. And interwoven with the story,\r\nlike an eerie breathing from the dark of woods at dusk and dawn, is\r\nthe haunting presence of Iselin, _la belle dame sans merci_.\r\n\r\nOtto Weininger, the author of _Sex and Character_, said of _Pan_ that\r\nit was "perhaps the most beautiful novel ever written." Weininger, of\r\ncourse, was an extremist, and few would accept his judgment without\r\nreserve. It is doubtful whether any writer nowadays would venture to\r\nmake such a claim for any book at all.\r\n\r\n_Pan_ is a book that offends against all sorts of rules; as a literary\r\nproduct it is eminently calculated to elicit, especially in England,\r\nthe Olympian "this will never do." To begin with, it is not so much a\r\nnovel as a _novelle_--a form of art little cultivated in this country,\r\nbut which lends itself excellently to delicate artistic handling, and\r\nthe creation of that subtle influence which Hamsun\'s countrymen call\r\n_stemning_, poorly rendered by the English "atmosphere." The epilogue\r\nis disproportionately long; the portion written as by another hand\r\nis all too recognizably in the style of the rest. And with all his\r\nchivalrous sacrifice and violent end, Glahn is at best a quixotic\r\nhero. Men, as men, would think him rather a fool, and women, as\r\nwomen, might flush at the thought of a cavalier so embarrassingly\r\nunrestrained. He is not to be idolized as a cinema star, or the\r\nliterary gymnastic hero of a perennial Earl\'s Court Exhibition set\r\nto music on the stage. He could not be truthfully portrayed on a\r\nflamboyant wrapper as at all seductively masculine. In a word, he is\r\nneither a man\'s man nor a woman\'s man. But he is a human being, keenly\r\nsusceptible to influence which most of us have felt, in some degree.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to _Pan_ is _Victoria_, likewise a story of conflict\r\nbetween two lovers. The actual plot can only be described as\r\nhackneyed. Girl and boy, the rich man\'s daughter and the poor man\'s\r\nson, playmates in youth, then separated by the barriers of social\r\nstanding--few but the most hardened of "best-sellers" catering for\r\nsemi-detached suburbia would venture nowadays to handle such a theme.\r\nYet Hamsun dares, and so insistently unlike all else is the impress\r\nof his personality that the mechanical structure of the story is\r\nforgotten. It is interspersed with irrelevant fancies, visions and\r\nimaginings, a chain of tied notes heard as an undertone through the\r\naction on the surface. The effect is that of something straining\r\ntowards an impossible realization; a beating of wings in the void; a\r\nstriving for utterance of things beyond speech.\r\n\r\n_Victoria_ is the swan-song of Hamsun\'s subjective period. Already, in\r\nthe three plays which appeared during the years immediately following\r\n_Pan_, he faces the merciless law of change; the unrelenting "forward"\r\nwhich means leaving loved things behind. Kareno, student of life,\r\nbegins his career in resolute opposition to the old men, the\r\nestablished authorities who stand for compromise and resignation. For\r\ntwenty years he remains obstinately faithful to his creed, that the\r\nold men must step aside or be thrust aside, to make way for the youth\r\nthat will be served. "What has age that youth has not? Experience.\r\nExperience, in, all its poor and withered nakedness. And what use\r\nis their experience to us, who must make our own in every single\r\nhappening of life?" In _Aftenroede_, the "Sunset" of the trilogy,\r\nKareno himself deserts the cause of youth, and allies himself to the\r\nparty in power. And the final scene shows him telling a story to a\r\nchild: "There was once a man who never would give way...."\r\n\r\nThe madness of _Sult_ is excused as being delirium, due to physical\r\nsuffering. Nagel, in _Mysterier_, is shown as a fool, an eccentric\r\nintolerable in ordinary society, though he is disconcertingly human,\r\nparadoxically sane. Glahn, in _Pan_, apologizes for his uncouth\r\nstraightforwardness by confessing that he is more at home in the\r\nwoods, where he can say and do what he pleases without offence.\r\nJohannes, in _Victoria_, is of humble birth, which counts in\r\nextenuation of his unmannerly frankness in early years. Later he\r\nbecomes a poet, and as such is exempt in some degree from the\r\nconventional restraint imposed on those who aspire to polite society.\r\nAll these well-chosen characters are made to serve the author\'s\r\npurpose as channels for poetic utterance that might otherwise seem\r\nirrelevant. The extent to which this is done may be seen from the way\r\nin which Hamsun lets a character in one book enter upon a theme\r\nwhich later becomes the subject of an independent work by the author\r\nhimself. Thus Glahn is haunted by visions of Diderik and Iselin;\r\nJohannes writes fragments supposed to be spoken by one Vendt the Monk.\r\nFive years after _Victoria_, Hamsun gives us the romantic drama of\r\n_Munken Vendt_, in which Diderik and Iselin appear.\r\n\r\nThroughout these early works, Hamsun is striving to find expression\r\nfor his own sensitive personality; a form and degree of expression\r\nsufficient to relieve his own tension of feeling, without fusing the\r\nmedium; adequate to his own needs, yet understandable and tolerable\r\nto ordinary human beings; to the readers of books. The process, in\r\neffect, is simply this: Hamsun is a poet, with a poet\'s deep and\r\nunusual feeling, and a poet\'s need of utterance. To gain a hearing, he\r\nchooses figures whom he can conveniently represent as fools. Secretly,\r\nhe loves them, for they are himself. But to the world he can present\r\nthem with a polite apology, a plea for kindly indulgence.\r\n\r\nIt is not infrequent in literature to find the wisest and most\r\npoignant utterances thus laid in the mouths of poor men clad in\r\nmotley. Some of the most daring things in Shakespeare, the newest\r\nheresies of the Renaissance, are voiced by irresponsibles. Of all\r\ndramatic figures, that of the fool is most suited to the expression\r\nof concentrated feeling. There is an arresting question in a play of\r\nrecent years, which runs something like this: "Do you think that the\r\nthings people make fools of themselves about are any less real and\r\ntrue than the things they behave sensibly about?"\r\n\r\nMost of us have at some time or another felt that uncomfortable,\r\nalmost indecently denuding question which comes to us at rare moments\r\nfrom the stage where some great drama is being played: What is higher,\r\nwhat is more real: this, or the life we live? In that sudden flash,\r\nthe matters of today\'s and tomorrow\'s reality in our minds appear as\r\nvulgar trifles, things of which we are ashamed. The feeling lasts but\r\na moment; for a moment we have been something higher than ourselves,\r\nin the mere desire so to be. Then we fall back to ourselves once more,\r\nto the lower levels upon which alone we can exist. And yet it is by\r\nsuch potentials that we judge the highest art; by its power to give\r\nus, if only for a moment, something of that which the divinity of our\r\naspiring minds finds wanting in the confines of reality.\r\n\r\nThe richness of this quality is one of the most endearing things in\r\nHamsun\'s characters. Their sensitiveness is a thing we have been\r\ntrained, for self-defence, to repress. It is well for us, no doubt,\r\nthat this is so. But we are grateful for their showing that such\r\nthings _are_, as we are grateful for Kensington Gardens who cannot\r\nlive where trees are everywhere. The figures Hamsun sets before us\r\nas confessedly unsuited to the realities of life, his vagabonds, his\r\nfailures, his fools, have power at times to make us question whether\r\nour world of comfort, luxury, success, is what we thought; if it were\r\nnot well lost in exchange for the power to _feel_ as they.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that life is a comedy to those who think, a tragedy\r\nto those who feel. Humanly speaking, it is one of the greatest merits\r\nof Hamsun\'s work that he shows otherwise. His attitude towards life\r\nis throughout one of feeling, yet he makes of life no tragedy, but a\r\nbeautiful story.\r\n\r\n"I will be young until I die," says Kareno in _Aftenroede_. The words\r\nare not so much a challenge to fate as a denial of fact; he is not\r\nfighting, only refusing to acknowledge the power that is already hard\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nKareno is an _intellectual_ character. He is a philosopher, a man\r\nwhose perceptions and activity lie predominantly in the sphere of\r\nthought, not of feeling. His attempt to carry the fire of youth beyond\r\nthe grave of youth ends in disaster; an unnecessary _debacle_ due to\r\nhis gratuitously attempting the impossible.\r\n\r\nHamsun\'s poet-personality, the spirit we have seen striving for\r\nexpression through the figures of Nagel, Glahn, Johannes, and the\r\nrest, is a creature of _feeling_. And here the development proceeds on\r\naltogether different lines. The emotion which fails to find adequate\r\noutlet, even in such works as _Sult_, _Mysterier_, _Victoria_, and\r\n_Pan_, might well seem more of a peril than the quixotic stubbornness\r\nof Kareno\'s philosophy. Such a flood, in its tempestuous unrest, might\r\nseem to threaten destruction, or at best the vain dispersal of its own\r\npower into chaos. But by some rare guidance it is led, after the storm\r\nof _Munken Vendt_, into channels of beneficent fertility.\r\n\r\nIn 1904, after an interval of short stories, letters of travel, and\r\npoems, came the story entitled _Svoermere_. The word means "Moths." It\r\nalso stands for something else; something for which we English, as\r\na sensible people, have no word. Something pleasantly futile,\r\ndeliciously unprofitable--foolish lovers, hovering like moths about a\r\nlamp.\r\n\r\nBut there is more than this that is untranslatable in the title. _As_\r\na title it suggests an attitude of gentleness, tenderness, sympathy,\r\ntoward whomsoever it describes. It is a new note in Hamsun; the\r\nopening of a new _motif_.\r\n\r\nThe main thread of the story bears a certain similarity to that of\r\n_Mysterier_, _Vicioria_, and _Pan_, being a love affair of mazy\r\nwindings, a tangled skein of loves-me-loves-me-not. But it is pure\r\ncomedy throughout. Rolandsen, the telegraph operator in love with\r\nElsie Mack, is no poet; he has not even any pretensions to education\r\nor social standing. He is a cheerful, riotous "blade," who sports\r\nwith the girls of the village, gets drunk at times, and serenades the\r\nparson\'s wife at night with his guitar. _Svoermere_ is the slightest\r\nof little stories in itself, but full of delightful vagaries and the\r\nmost winning humour.\r\n\r\nThe story of _Benoni_, with its continuation _Rosa_, is in like vein;\r\na tenderly humorous portrayal of love below stairs, the principal\r\ncharacters being chosen from the class who appear as supers in _Pan_;\r\nsubjects or retainers of the all-powerful Trader Mack. It is as if\r\nthe sub-plots in one of Shakespeare\'s plays had been taken out for\r\nseparate presentment, and the clown promoted to be hero in a play of\r\nhis own. The cast is increased, the _milieu_ lightly drawn in _Pan_\r\nis now shown more comprehensively and in detail, making us gradually\r\nacquainted with a whole little community, a village world, knowing\r\nlittle of any world beyond, and forming a microcosm in itself.\r\n\r\nHamsun has returned, as it were, to the scene of his passionate\r\nyouth, but in altered guise. He plays no part himself now, but is an\r\nonlooker, a stander-by, chronicling, as from a cloistered aloofness,\r\nyet with kindly wisdom always, the little things that matter in the\r\nlives of those around him. Wisdom and kindliness, sympathy and humour\r\nand understanding, these are the dominant notes of the new phase.\r\n_Svoermere_ ends happily--for it is a story of other people\'s lives.\r\nSo also with Benoni and Rosa at the last. And so surely has the author\r\nestablished his foothold on the new ground that he can even bring in\r\nEdvarda, the "Iselin" figure from _Pan_, once more, thus linking up\r\nhis brave and lusty comedies of middle age with the romantic tragedies\r\nof his youth, making a comprehensive pageant-play of large-hearted\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the effect upon himself is seen--and avowed. Between\r\n_Svoermere_ and _Benoni_ comes the frankly first-personal narrative\r\nof a vagabond who describes himself, upon interrogation, as "Knut\r\nPedersen"--which is two-thirds of Knut Pedersen Hamsund--and hailing\r\nfrom Nordland--which embraces Lofoten.\r\n\r\nIt does not need any showing of paper, however, to establish the\r\nidentity of Knut Pedersen, vagabond, with the author of _Pan_. The\r\nopening words of the book ("Under Hoeststjaernen") are enough. "Indian\r\nsummer, mild and warm ... it is many years now since I knew such\r\npeace. Twenty or thirty years maybe--or maybe it was in another life.\r\nBut I have felt it some time, surely, since I go about now humming a\r\nlittle tune; go about rejoicing, loving every straw and every stone,\r\nand feeling as if they cared for me in return...."\r\n\r\nThis is the Hamsun of _Pan_. But Hamsun now is a greater soul than in\r\nthe days when Glahn, the solitary dweller in the woods, picked up a\r\nbroken twig from the ground and held it lovingly, because it looked\r\npoor and forsaken; or thanked the hillock of stone outside his hut\r\nbecause it stood there faithfully, as a friend that waited his return.\r\nHe is stronger now, but no less delicate; he loves not Nature less,\r\nbut the world more. He has learned to love his fellow-men.\r\nKnut Pedersen, vagabond, wanders about the country with his\r\ntramp-companions, Grindhusen, the painter who can ditch and delve at a\r\npinch, or Falkenberg, farm-labourer in harvest-time, and piano-tuner\r\nwhere pianos are. Here is brave comradeship, the sharing of\r\nadventures, the ready wit of jovial vagrants. The book is a harmless\r\npicaresque, a _geste_ of innocent rogue-errantry; its place is with\r\n_Lavengro_ and _The Cloister and the Hearth_, in that ancient, endless\r\norder of tales which link up age with age and land with land in the\r\nunaltering, unfrontiered fellowship of the road that kept the spirit\r\nof poetry alive through the Dark Ages.\r\n\r\nThe vagabond from Nordland has his own adventures, his _bonnes\r\nfortunes_. There is a touch of Sterne about the book; not\r\nthe exaggerated super-Sterne of Tristram Shandy, with\r\neighteenth-century-futurist blanks and marbled pages, but the fluent,\r\ncasual, follow-your-fancy Sterne of the _Sentimental Journey_. Yet\r\nthe vagabond himself is unobtrusive, ready to step back and be a\r\nchronicler the moment other figures enter into constellation. He moves\r\namong youth, himself no longer young, and among gentlefolk, as one\r\nmaking no claim to equal rank.\r\n\r\nBoth these features are accentuated further in the story of the\r\nWanderer with the Mute. It is a continuation of _Under Hoeststjaernen_,\r\nand forms the culmination, the acquiescent close, of the\r\nself-expressional series that began with _Sult_. The discords of\r\ntortured loveliness are now resolved into an ultimate harmony of\r\ncomely resignation and rich content. "A Wanderer may come to fifty\r\nyears; he plays more softly then. Plays with muted strings." This is\r\nthe keynote of the book. The Wanderer is no longer young; it is for\r\nyouth to make the stories old men tell. Tragedy is reserved for those\r\nof high estate; a wanderer in corduroy, "such as labourers wear here\r\nin the south," can tell the story of his chatelaine and her lovers\r\nwith the self-repression of a humbler Henry Esmond, winning nothing\r\nfor himself even at the last, yet feeling he is still in Nature\'s\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\nHamsun\'s next work is _Den Siste Gloede_ (literally "The Last Joy").\r\nThe title as it stands is expressive. The substantive is "joy"--but\r\nit is so qualified by the preceding "last," a word of overwhelming\r\ninfluence in any combination, that the total effect is one of sadness.\r\nAnd the book itself is a masterly presentment of gloom. Masterly--or\r\nmost natural: it is often hard to say how much of Hamsun\'s effect is\r\ndue to superlative technique and how much to the inspired disregard of\r\nall technique. _Den Siste Gloede_ is a diary of wearisome days, spent\r\nfor the most part among unattractive, insignificant people at a\r\nholiday resort; the only "action" in it is an altogether pitiful love\r\naffair, in which the narrator is involved to the slightest possible\r\ndegree. The writer is throughout despondent; he feels himself out of\r\nthe race; his day is past. Solitude and quiet, Nature, and his own\r\nfoolish feelings--these are the "last joys" left him now.\r\n\r\nThe book might have seemed a fitting, if pathetic, ending to the\r\nliterary career of the author of _Pan_. Certainly it holds out no\r\npromise of further energy or interest in life or work. The closing\r\nwords amount to a personal farewell.\r\n\r\nThen, without warning, Hamsun enters upon a new phase of power. _Boern\r\nav Tilden_ (Children of the Age) is an objective study, its main theme\r\nbeing the "marriage" conflict touched upon in the Wanderer\r\nstories, and here developed in a different setting and with fuller\r\nindividuality. Hamsun has here moved up a step in the social scale,\r\nfrom villagers of the Benoni type to the land-owning class. There is\r\nthe same conflict of temperaments that we have seen before, but less\r\nviolent now; the poet\'s late-won calm of mind, and the level\r\nof culture from which his characters now are drawn--perhaps by\r\ninstinctive selection--make for restraint. Still a romantic at heart,\r\nhe becomes more classic in form.\r\n\r\n_Boern av Tilden_ is also the story of Segelfoss, in its passing from\r\nthe tranquil dignity of a semi-feudal estate to the complex and\r\nruthless modernity of an industrial centre. _Segelfoss By_ (1915)\r\ntreats of the fortunes of the succeeding generation, and the further\r\ndevelopment of Segelfoss into a township ("By").\r\n\r\nThen, with _Growth of the Soil_, Hamsun achieves his greatest triumph.\r\nSetting aside all that mattered most to himself, he turns, with the\r\nexperience of a lifetime rich in conflict, to the things that matter\r\nto us all. Deliberately shorn of all that makes for mere effect, Isak\r\nstands out as an elemental figure, the symbol of Man at his best,\r\nface to face with Nature and life. There is no greater human\r\ncharacter--reverently said--in the Bible itself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the steps of Hamsun\'s progress as an author, from the\r\npassionate chaos of _Sult_ to the Miltonic, monumental calm of _Growth\r\nof the Soil_. The stages in themselves are full of beauty; the\r\nwistfulness of _Pan_ and _Victoria_, the kindly humour of _Svoermere_\r\nand _Benoni_, the autumn-tinted resignation of the Wanderer with the\r\nMute--they follow as the seasons do, each with a charm of its own,\r\nyet all deriving from one source. His muse at first is Iselin, the\r\nembodiment of adolescent longing, the dream of those "whom delight\r\nflies because they give her chase." The hopelessness of his own\r\npursuit fills him with pity for mortals under the same spell, and he\r\nsteps aside to be a brave, encouraging chorus, or a kindly chronicler\r\nof others\' lives. And his reward is the love of a greater divinity,\r\nthe goddess of field and homestead. No will-o\'-the-wisp, but a\r\npresence of wisdom and calm.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Growth of the Soil, by Knut Hamsun\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK GROWTH OF THE SOIL ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 10984.txt or 10984.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/9/8/10984/\r\n\r\nProduced by Kevin Handy, Dave Maddock, Josephine Paolucci and the\r\nOnline Distributed Proofreading Team.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Of course, we hope that you will support the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by\r\nfreely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of\r\nthis agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with\r\nthe work.

Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\r\neffort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\r\npublic domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\ncollection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain\r\n"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or\r\ncorrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual\r\nproperty infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a\r\ncomputer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by\r\nyour equipment.\r\n\r\n1.F.2.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\'s\r\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\r\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\r\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\r\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\r\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\r\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\r\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\r\ndownload by the etext year.\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06\r\n\r\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\r\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\r\n\r\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\r\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\r\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\r\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\r\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\r\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234\r\n\r\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689\r\n\r\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL\r\n\r\n\r\n'
