JAMES RIGBY_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DORRINGTON DEED-BOX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe Narrative of Mr. James Rigby\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall here set down in language as simple and straightforward as I\r\ncan command, the events which followed my recent return to England;\r\nand I shall leave it to others to judge whether or not my conduct has\r\nbeen characterised by foolish fear and ill-considered credulity. At\r\nthe same time I have my own opinion as to what would have been the\r\nbehaviour of any other man of average intelligence and courage in the\r\nsame circumstances; more especially a man of my exceptional upbringing\r\nand retired habits.\r\n\r\nI was born in Australia, and I have lived there all my life till quite\r\nrecently, save for a single trip to Europe as a boy, in company with\r\nmy father and mother. It was then that I lost my father. I was less\r\nthan nine years old at the time, but my memory of the events of that\r\nEuropean trip is singularly vivid.\r\n\r\nMy father had emigrated to Australia at the time of his marriage, and\r\nhad become a rich man by singularly fortunate speculations in land in\r\nand about Sydney. As a family we were most uncommonly self-centred and\r\nisolated. From my parents I never heard a word as to their relatives\r\nin England; indeed to this day I do not as much as know what was\r\nthe Christian name of my grandfather. I have often supposed that\r\nsome serious family quarrel or great misfortune must have preceded\r\nor accompanied my father\'s marriage. Be that as it may, I was never\r\nable to learn anything of my relatives, either on my mother\'s or my\r\nfather\'s side. Both parents, however, were educated people, and indeed\r\nI fancy that their habit of seclusion must first have arisen from\r\nthis circumstance, since the colonists about them in the early days,\r\nexcellent people as they were, were not as a class distinguished for\r\nextreme intellectual culture. My father had his library stocked from\r\nEngland, and added to by fresh arrivals from time to time; and among\r\nhis books he would pass most of his days, taking, however, now and\r\nagain an excursion with a gun in search of some new specimen to add to\r\nhis museum of natural history, which occupied three long rooms in our\r\nhouse by the Lane Cove river.\r\n\r\nI was, as I have said, eight years of age when I started with my\r\nparents on a European tour, and it was in the year 1873. We stayed but\r\na short while in England at first arrival, intending to make a longer\r\nstay on our return from the Continent. We made our tour, taking Italy\r\nlast, and it was here that my father encountered a dangerous adventure.\r\n\r\nWe were at Naples, and my father had taken an odd fancy for a\r\npicturesque-looking ruffian who had attracted his attention by a\r\ncomplexion unusually fair for an Italian, and in whom he professed to\r\nrecognise a likeness to Tasso the poet. This man became his guide in\r\nexcursions about the neighbourhood of Naples, though he was not one\r\nof the regular corps of guides, and indeed seemed to have no regular\r\noccupation of a definite sort. "Tasso," as my father always called him,\r\nseemed a civil fellow enough, and was fairly intelligent; but my mother\r\ndisliked him extremely from the first, without being able to offer any\r\nvery distinct reason for her aversion. In the event her instinct was\r\nproved true.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIS ASSAILANT FELL DEAD.]\r\n\r\n"Tasso"--his correct name, by the way, was Tommaso Marino--persuaded\r\nmy father that something interesting was to be seen at the Astroni\r\ncrater, four miles west of the city, or thereabout; persuaded him,\r\nmoreover, to make the journey on foot; and the two accordingly set\r\nout. All went well enough till the crater was reached, and then, in\r\na lonely and broken part of the hill, the guide suddenly turned and\r\nattacked my father with a knife, his intention, without a doubt, being\r\nmurder and the acquisition of the Englishman\'s valuables. Fortunately\r\nmy father had a hip-pocket with a revolver in it, for he had been\r\nwarned of the danger a stranger might at that time run wandering in\r\nthe country about Naples. He received a wound in the flesh of his\r\nleft arm in an attempt to ward off a stab, and fired, at wrestling\r\ndistance, with the result that his assailant fell dead on the spot. He\r\nleft the place with all speed, tying up his arm as he went, sought the\r\nBritish consul at Naples, and informed him of the whole circumstances.\r\nFrom the authorities there was no great difficulty. An examination or\r\ntwo, a few signatures, some particular exertions on the part of\r\nthe consul, and my father was free, so far as the officers of the law\r\nwere concerned. But while these formalities were in progress no less\r\nthan three attempts were made on his life--two by the knife and one by\r\nshooting--and in each his escape was little short of miraculous. For\r\nthe dead ruffian, Marino, had been a member of the dreaded Camorra, and\r\nthe Camorristi were eager to avenge his death. To anybody acquainted\r\nwith the internal history of Italy--more particularly the history of\r\nthe old kingdom of Naples--the name of the Camorra will be familiar\r\nenough. It was one of the worst and most powerful of the many powerful\r\nand evil secret societies of Italy, and had none of the excuses for\r\nexistence which have been from time to time put forward on behalf of\r\nthe others. It was a gigantic club for the commission of crime and\r\nthe extortion of money. So powerful was it that it actually imposed a\r\nregular tax on all food material entering Naples--a tax collected and\r\npaid with far more regularity than were any of the taxes due to the\r\nlawful Government of the country. The carrying of smuggled goods was\r\na monopoly of the Camorra, a perfect organisation existing for the\r\npurpose throughout the kingdom. The whole population was terrorised\r\nby this detestable society, which had no less than twelve centres in\r\nthe city of Naples alone. It contracted for the commission of crime\r\njust as systematically and calmly as a railway company contracts\r\nfor the carriage of merchandise. A murder was so much, according\r\nto circumstances, with extras for disposing of the body; arson was\r\ndealt in profitably; maimings and kidnappings were carried out with\r\npromptitude and despatch; and any diabolical outrage imaginable was a\r\nmere matter of price. One of the staple vocations of the concern was of\r\ncourse brigandage. After the coming of Victor Emanuel and the fusion\r\nof Italy into one kingdom the Camorra lost some of its power, but for\r\na long time gave considerable trouble. I have heard that in the year\r\nafter the matters I am describing two hundred Camorristi were banished\r\nfrom Italy.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the legal forms were complied with, my father received\r\nthe broadest possible official hint that the sooner and the more\r\nsecretly he left the country the better it would be for himself and\r\nhis family. The British consul, too, impressed it upon him that the\r\nlaw would be entirely unable to protect him against the machinations\r\nof the Camorra; and indeed it needed but little persuasion to induce\r\nus to leave, for my poor mother was in a state of constant terror lest\r\nwe were murdered together in our hotel; so that we lost no time in\r\nreturning to England and bringing our European trip to a close.\r\n\r\nIn London we stayed at a well-known private hotel near Bond Street. We\r\nhad been but three days here when my father came in one evening with a\r\nfirm conviction that he had been followed for something like two hours,\r\nand followed very skilfully too. More than once he had doubled suddenly\r\nwith a view to confront the pursuers, who he felt were at his heels,\r\nbut he had met nobody of a suspicious appearance. The next afternoon I\r\nheard my mother telling my governess (who was travelling with us) of an\r\nunpleasant-looking man, who had been hanging about opposite the hotel\r\ndoor, and who, she felt sure, had afterwards been following her and my\r\nfather as they were walking. My mother grew nervous, and communicated\r\nher fears to my father. He, however, pooh-poohed the thing, and took\r\nlittle thought of its meaning. Nevertheless the dogging continued, and\r\nmy father, who was never able to fix upon the persons who caused the\r\nannoyance--indeed he rather felt their presence by instinct, as one\r\ndoes in such cases, than otherwise--grew extremely angry, and had some\r\nidea of consulting the police. Then one morning my mother discovered\r\na little paper label stuck on the outside of the door of the bedroom\r\noccupied by herself and my father. It was a small thing, circular, and\r\nabout the size of a sixpenny-piece, or even smaller, but my mother was\r\nquite certain that it had not been there when she last entered the door\r\nthe night before, and she was much terrified. For the label carried a\r\ntiny device, drawn awkwardly in ink--a pair of knives of curious shape,\r\ncrossed: the sign of the Camorra.\r\n\r\nNobody knew anything of this label, or how it came where it had been\r\nfound. My mother urged my father to place himself under the protection\r\nof the police at once, but he delayed. Indeed, I fancy he had a\r\nsuspicion that the label might be the production of some practical\r\njoker staying at the hotel who had heard of his Neapolitan adventure\r\n(it was reported in many newspapers) and designed to give him a fright.\r\nBut that very evening my poor father was found dead, stabbed in a\r\ndozen places, in a short, quiet street not forty yards from the hotel.\r\nHe had merely gone out to buy a few cigars of a particular brand which\r\nhe fancied, at a shop two streets away, and in less than half an hour\r\nof his departure the police were at the hotel door with the news of his\r\ndeath, having got his address from letters in his pockets.\r\n\r\nIt is no part of my present design to enlarge on my mother\'s grief, or\r\nto describe in detail the incidents that followed my father\'s death,\r\nfor I am going back to this early period of my life merely to make more\r\nclear the bearings of what has recently happened to myself. It will\r\nbe sufficient therefore to say that at the inquest the jury returned\r\na verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown;\r\nthat it was several times reported that the police had obtained a most\r\nimportant clue, and that being so, very naturally there was never any\r\narrest. We returned to Sydney, and there I grew up.\r\n\r\nI should perhaps have mentioned ere this that my profession--or I\r\nshould rather say my hobby--is that of an artist. Fortunately or\r\nunfortunately, as you may please to consider it, I have no need to\r\nfollow any profession as a means of livelihood, but since I was\r\nsixteen years of age my whole time has been engrossed in drawing and\r\npainting. Were it not for my mother\'s invincible objection to parting\r\nwith me, even for the shortest space of time, I should long ago have\r\ncome to Europe to work and to study in the regular schools. As it was\r\nI made shift to do my best in Australia, and wandered about pretty\r\nfreely, struggling with the difficulties of moulding into artistic form\r\nthe curious Australian landscape. There is an odd, desolate, uncanny\r\nnote in characteristic Australian scenery, which most people are apt to\r\nregard as of little value for the purposes of the landscape painter,\r\nbut with which I have always been convinced that an able painter could\r\ndo great things. So I did my feeble best.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago my mother died. My age was then twenty-eight, and I was\r\nleft without a friend in the world, and, so far as I know, without a\r\nrelative. I soon found it impossible any longer to inhabit the large\r\nhouse by the Lane Cove river. It was beyond my simple needs, and the\r\nwhole thing was an embarrassment, to say nothing of the associations\r\nof the house with my dead mother, which exercised a painful and\r\ndepressing effect on me. So I sold the house, and cut myself adrift.\r\nFor a year or more I pursued the life of a lonely vagabond in New\r\nSouth Wales, painting as well as I could its scattered forests of\r\nmagnificent trees, with their curious upturned foliage. Then, miserably\r\ndissatisfied with my performance, and altogether filled with a restless\r\nspirit, I determined to quit the colony and live in England, or at\r\nany rate somewhere in Europe. I would paint at the Paris schools, I\r\npromised myself, and acquire that technical mastery of my material that\r\nI now felt the lack of.\r\n\r\nThe thing was no sooner resolved on than begun. I instructed my\r\nsolicitors in Sydney to wind up my affairs and to communicate with\r\ntheir London correspondents in order that, on my arrival in England,\r\nI might deal with business matters through them. I had more than half\r\nresolved to transfer all my property to England, and to make the old\r\ncountry my permanent headquarters; and in three weeks from the date\r\nof my resolve I had started. I carried with me the necessary letters\r\nof introduction to the London solicitors, and the deeds appertaining\r\nto certain land in South Australia, which my father had bought just\r\nbefore his departure on the fatal European trip. There was workable\r\ncopper in this land, it had since been ascertained, and I believed I\r\nmight profitably dispose of the property to a company in London.\r\n\r\nI found myself to some extent out of my element on board a great\r\npassenger steamer. It seemed no longer possible for me in the constant\r\nassociation of shipboard to maintain that reserve which had become with\r\nme a second nature. But so much had it become my nature that I shrank\r\nridiculously from breaking it, for, grown man as I was, it must be\r\nconfessed that I was absurdly shy, and indeed I fear little better than\r\nan overgrown schoolboy in my manner. But somehow I was scarce a day at\r\nsea before falling into a most pleasant acquaintanceship with another\r\npassenger, a man of thirty-eight or forty, whose name was Dorrington.\r\nHe was a tall, well-built fellow, rather handsome, perhaps, except for\r\na certain extreme roundness of face and fulness of feature; he had a\r\ndark military moustache, and carried himself erect, with a swing as of\r\na cavalryman, and his eyes had, I think, the most penetrating quality\r\nI ever saw. His manners were extremely engaging, and he was the only\r\ngood talker I had ever met. He knew everybody, and had been everywhere.\r\nHis fund of illustration and anecdote was inexhaustible, and during\r\nall my acquaintance with him I never heard him tell the same story\r\ntwice. Nothing could happen--not a bird could fly by the ship, not a\r\ndish could be put on the table, but Dorrington was ready with a pungent\r\nremark and the appropriate anecdote. And he never bored nor wearied\r\none. With all his ready talk he never appeared unduly obtrusive nor\r\nin the least egotistic. Mr. Horace Dorrington was altogether the most\r\ncharming person I had ever met. Moreover we discovered a community of\r\ntaste in cigars.\r\n\r\n"By the way," said Dorrington to me one magnificent evening as we\r\nleaned on the rail and smoked, "Rigby isn\'t a very common name in\r\nAustralia, is it? I seem to remember a case, twenty years ago or more,\r\nof an Australian gentleman of that name being very badly treated\r\nin London--indeed, now I think of it, I\'m not sure that he wasn\'t\r\nmurdered. Ever hear anything of it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said, "I heard a great deal, unfortunately. He was my father,\r\nand he _was_ murdered."\r\n\r\n"Your father? There--I\'m awfully sorry. Perhaps I shouldn\'t have\r\nmentioned it; but of course I didn\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Oh," I replied, "that\'s all right. It\'s so far back now that I don\'t\r\nmind speaking about it. It was a very extraordinary thing altogether."\r\nAnd then, feeling that I owed Dorrington a story of some sort, after\r\nlistening to the many he had been telling me, I described to him the\r\nwhole circumstances of my father\'s death.\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Dorrington when I had finished, "I have heard of the Camorra\r\nbefore this--I know a thing or two about it, indeed. As a matter of\r\nfact it still exists; not quite the widespread and open thing it once\r\nwas, of course, and much smaller; but pretty active in a quiet way,\r\nand pretty mischievous. They were a mighty bad lot, those Camorristi.\r\nPersonally I\'m rather surprised that you heard no more of them. They\r\nwere the sort of people who would rather any day murder three people\r\nthan one, and their usual idea of revenge went a good way beyond the\r\nmere murder of the offending party; they had a way of including his\r\nwife and family, and as many relatives as possible. But at any rate\r\n_you_ seem to have got off all right, though I\'m inclined to call it\r\nrather a piece of luck than otherwise."\r\n\r\nThen, as was his invariable habit, he launched into anecdote. He told\r\nme of the crimes of the Maffia, that Italian secret society, larger\r\neven and more powerful than the Camorra, and almost as criminal;\r\ntales of implacable revenge visited on father, son, and grandson\r\nin succession, till the race was extirpated. Then he talked of the\r\nmethods; of the large funds at the disposal of the Camorra and the\r\nMaffia, and of the cunning patience with which their schemes were\r\ncarried into execution; of the victims who had discovered too late\r\nthat their most trusted servants were sworn to their destruction, and\r\nof those who had fled to remote parts of the earth and hoped to be\r\nlost and forgotten, but who had been shadowed and slain with barbarous\r\nferocity in their most trusted hiding-places. Wherever Italians were,\r\nthere was apt to be a branch of one of the societies, and one could\r\nnever tell where they might or might not turn up. The two Italian\r\nforecastle hands on board at that moment might be members, and might\r\nor might not have some business in hand not included in their signed\r\narticles.\r\n\r\nI asked if he had ever come into personal contact with either of these\r\nsocieties or their doings.\r\n\r\n"With the Camorra, no, though I know things about them that would\r\nprobably surprise some of them not a little. But I have had\r\nprofessional dealings with the Maffia--and that without coming off\r\nsecond best, too. But it was not so serious a case as your father\'s;\r\none of a robbery of documents and blackmail."\r\n\r\n"Professional dealings?" I queried.\r\n\r\nDorrington laughed. "Yes," he answered. "I find I\'ve come very near to\r\nletting the cat out of the bag. I don\'t generally tell people who I am\r\nwhen I travel about, and indeed I don\'t always use my own name, as I am\r\ndoing now. Surely you\'ve heard the name at some time or another?"\r\n\r\nI had to confess that I did not remember it. But I excused myself by\r\nciting my secluded life, and the fact that I had never left Australia\r\nsince I was a child.\r\n\r\n"Ah," he said, "of course we should be less heard of in Australia. But\r\nin England we\'re really pretty well known, my partner and I. But, come\r\nnow, look me all over and consider, and I\'ll give you a dozen guesses\r\nand bet you a sovereign you can\'t tell me my trade. And it\'s not such\r\nan uncommon or unheard-of trade, neither."\r\n\r\nGuessing would have been hopeless, and I said so. He did not seem the\r\nsort of man who would trouble himself about a trade at all. I gave it\r\nup.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said, "I\'ve no particular desire to have it known all over\r\nthe ship, but I don\'t mind telling you--you\'d find it out probably\r\nbefore long if you settle in the old country--that we are what is\r\ncalled private inquiry agents--detectives--secret service men--whatever\r\nyou like to call it."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed. And I think I may claim that we stand as high as any--if\r\nnot a trifle higher. Of course I can\'t tell you, but you\'d be rather\r\nastonished if you heard the names of some of our clients. We have had\r\ndealings with certain royalties, European and Asiatic, that would\r\nstartle you a bit if I could tell them. Dorrington & Hicks is the name\r\nof the firm, and we are both pretty busy men, though we keep going a\r\nregiment of assistants and correspondents. I have been in Australia\r\nthree months over a rather awkward and complicated matter, but I fancy\r\nI\'ve pulled it through pretty well, and I mean to reward myself with a\r\nlittle holiday when I get back. There--now you know the worst of me.\r\nAnd D. & H. present their respectful compliments, and trust that by\r\nunfailing punctuality and a strict attention to business they may hope\r\nto receive your esteemed commands whenever you may be so unfortunate as\r\nto require their services. Family secrets extracted, cleaned, scaled,\r\nor stopped with gold. Special attention given to wholesale orders." He\r\nlaughed and pulled out his cigar-case. "You haven\'t another cigar in\r\nyour pocket," he said, "or you wouldn\'t smoke that stump so low. Try\r\none of these."\r\n\r\nI took the cigar and lit it at my remainder. "Ah, then," I said, "I\r\ntake it that it is the practice of your profession that has given you\r\nsuch a command of curious and out-of-the-way information and anecdote.\r\nPlainly you must have been in the midst of many curious affairs."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I believe you," Dorrington replied. "But, as it happens, the most\r\ncurious of my experiences I am unable to relate, since they are matters\r\nof professional confidence. Such as I _can_ tell I usually tell with\r\naltered names, dates, and places. One learns discretion in such a trade\r\nas mine."\r\n\r\n"As to your adventure with the Maffia, now. Is there any secrecy about\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\nDorrington shrugged his shoulders. "No," he said, "none in particular.\r\nBut the case was not particularly interesting. It was in Florence.\r\nThe documents were the property of a wealthy American, and some of\r\nthe Maffia rascals managed to steal them. It doesn\'t matter what the\r\ndocuments were--that\'s a private matter--but their owner would have\r\nparted with a great deal to get them back, and the Maffia held them for\r\nransom. But they had such a fearful notion of the American\'s wealth,\r\nand of what he ought to pay, that, badly as he wanted the papers back,\r\nhe couldn\'t stand their demands, and employed us to negotiate and to\r\ndo our best for him. I think I might have managed to get the things\r\nstolen back again--indeed I spent some time thinking a plan over--but\r\nI decided in the end that it wouldn\'t pay. If the Maffia were tricked\r\nin that way they might consider it appropriate to stick somebody\r\nwith a knife, and that was not an easy thing to provide against. So\r\nI took a little time and went another way to work. The details don\'t\r\nmatter--they\'re quite uninteresting, and to tell you them would be to\r\ntalk mere professional \'shop\'; there\'s a deal of dull and patient work\r\nto be done in my business. Anyhow, I contrived to find out exactly\r\nin whose hands the documents lay. He wasn\'t altogether a blameless\r\ncreature, and there were two or three little things that, properly\r\nhandled, might have brought him into awkward complications with the\r\nlaw. So I delayed the negotiations while I got my nets effectually\r\nround this gentleman, who was the president of that particular branch\r\nof the Maffia, and when all was ready I had a friendly interview with\r\nhim, and just showed him my hand of cards. They served as no other\r\nargument would have done, and in the end we concluded quite an amicable\r\narrangement on easy terms for both parties, and my client got his\r\nproperty back, including all expenses, at about a fifth of the price he\r\nexpected to have to pay. That\'s all. I learnt a deal about the Maffia\r\nwhile the business lasted, and at that and other times I learnt a good\r\ndeal about the Camorra too."\r\n\r\nDorrington and I grew more intimate every day of the voyage, till he\r\nknew every detail of my uneventful little history, and I knew many\r\nof his own most curious experiences. In truth he was a man with an\r\nirresistible fascination for a dull home-bird like myself. With all his\r\ngaiety he never forgot business, and at most of our stopping places he\r\nsent off messages by cable to his partner. As the voyage drew near its\r\nend he grew anxious and impatient lest he should not arrive in time to\r\nenable him to get to Scotland for grouse-shooting on the twelfth of\r\nAugust. His one amusement, it seemed, was shooting, and the holiday he\r\nhad promised himself was to be spent on a grouse-moor which he rented\r\nin Perthshire. It would be a great nuisance to miss the twelfth, he\r\nsaid, but it would apparently be a near shave. He thought, however,\r\nthat in any case it might be done by leaving the ship at Plymouth, and\r\nrushing up to London by the first train.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, "I think I shall be able to do it that way, even if the\r\nboat is a couple of days late. By the way," he added suddenly, "why not\r\ncome along to Scotland with me? You haven\'t any particular business in\r\nhand, and I can promise you a week or two of good fun."\r\n\r\nThe invitation pleased me. "It\'s very good of you," I said, "and as a\r\nmatter of fact I haven\'t any very urgent business in London. I must\r\nsee those solicitors I told you of, but that\'s not a matter of hurry;\r\nindeed an hour or two on my way through London would be enough. But as\r\nI don\'t know any of your party and----"\r\n\r\n"Pooh, pooh, my dear fellow," answered Dorrington, with a snap of\r\nhis fingers, "that\'s all right. I shan\'t have a party. There won\'t\r\nbe time to get it together. One or two might come down a little\r\nlater, but if they do they\'ll be capital fellows, delighted to make\r\nyour acquaintance, I\'m sure. Indeed you\'ll do me a great favour if\r\nyou\'ll come, else I shall be all alone, without a soul to say a word\r\nto. Anyway, I _won\'t_ miss the twelfth, if it\'s to be done by any\r\npossibility. You\'ll really have to come, you know--you\'ve no excuse. I\r\ncan lend you guns and anything you want, though I believe you\'ve such\r\nthings with you. Who is your London solicitor, by the way?"\r\n\r\n"Mowbray, of Lincoln\'s Inn Fields."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mowbray? We know him well; his partner died last year. When I say\r\n_we_ know him well, I mean as a firm. I have never met him personally,\r\nthough my partner (who does the office work) has regular dealings\r\nwith him. He\'s an excellent man, but his managing clerk\'s frightful;\r\nI wonder Mowbray keeps him. Don\'t you let him do anything for you on\r\nhis own hook; he makes the most disastrous messes, and I rather fancy\r\nhe drinks. Deal with Mowbray himself; there\'s nobody better in London.\r\nAnd by the way, now I think of it, it\'s lucky you\'ve nothing urgent for\r\nhim, for he\'s sure to be off out of town for the twelfth; he\'s a rare\r\nold gunner, and never misses a season. So that now you haven\'t a shade\r\nof an excuse for leaving me in the lurch, and we\'ll consider the thing\r\nsettled."\r\n\r\nSettled accordingly it was, and the voyage ended uneventfully. But the\r\nsteamer was late, and we left it at Plymouth and rushed up to town on\r\nthe tenth. We had three or four hours to prepare before leaving Euston\r\nby the night train. Dorrington\'s moor was a long drive from Crieff\r\nstation, and he calculated that at best we could not arrive there\r\nbefore the early evening of the following day, which would, however,\r\ngive us comfortable time for a good long night\'s rest before the\r\nmorning\'s sport opened. Fortunately I had plenty of loose cash with me,\r\nso that there was nothing to delay us in that regard. We made ready in\r\nDorrington\'s rooms (he was a bachelor) in Conduit Street, and got off\r\ncomfortably by the ten o\'clock train from Euston.\r\n\r\nThen followed a most delightful eight days. The weather was fine, the\r\nbirds were plentiful, and my first taste of grouse-shooting was a\r\ncomplete success. I resolved for the future to come out of my shell and\r\nmix in the world that contained such charming fellows as Dorrington,\r\nand such delightful sports as that I was then enjoying. But on the\r\neighth day Dorrington received a telegram calling him instantly to\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a shocking nuisance," he said; "here\'s my holiday either knocked\r\non the head altogether or cut in two, and I fear it\'s the first rather\r\nthan the second. It\'s just the way in such an uncertain profession as\r\nmine. There\'s no possible help for it, however; I must go, as you\'d\r\nunderstand at once if you knew the case. But what chiefly annoys me is\r\nleaving you all alone."\r\n\r\nI reassured him on this point, and pointed out that I had for a long\r\ntime been used to a good deal of my own company. Though indeed, with\r\nDorrington away, life at the shooting-lodge threatened to be less\r\npleasant than it had been.\r\n\r\n"But you\'ll be bored to death here," Dorrington said, his thoughts\r\njumping with my own. "But on the other hand it won\'t be much good\r\ngoing up to town yet. Everybody\'s out of town, and Mowbray among them.\r\nThere\'s a little business of ours that\'s waiting for him at this\r\nmoment--my partner mentioned it in his letter yesterday. Why not put in\r\nthe time with a little tour round? Or you might work up to London by\r\nirregular stages, and look about you. As an artist you\'d like to see\r\na few of the old towns--probably, Edinburgh, Chester, Warwick, and so\r\non. It isn\'t a great programme, perhaps, but I hardly know what else to\r\nsuggest. As for myself I must be off as I am by the first train I can\r\nget."\r\n\r\nI begged him not to trouble about me, but to attend to his business. As\r\na matter of fact, I was disposed to get to London and take chambers, at\r\nany rate for a little while. But Chester was a place I much wanted to\r\nsee--a real old town, with walls round it--and I was not indisposed to\r\ntake a day at Warwick. So in the end I resolved to pack up and make for\r\nChester the following day, and from there to take train for Warwick.\r\nAnd in half an hour Dorrington was gone.\r\n\r\nChester was all delight to me. My recollections of the trip to Europe\r\nin my childhood were vivid enough as to the misfortunes that followed\r\nmy father, but of the ancient buildings we visited I remembered little.\r\nNow in Chester I found the medi\xc3\xa6val town I had so often read of. I\r\nwandered for hours together in the quaint old "Rows," and walked on the\r\ncity wall. The evening after my arrival was fine and moonlight, and I\r\nwas tempted from my hotel. I took a stroll about the town and finished\r\nby a walk along the wall from the Watergate toward the cathedral. The\r\nmoon, flecked over now and again by scraps of cloud, and at times\r\nobscured for half a minute together, lighted up all the Roodee in the\r\nintervals, and touched with silver the river beyond. But as I walked\r\nI presently grew aware of a quiet shuffling footstep some little way\r\nbehind me. I took little heed of it at first, though I could see nobody\r\nnear me from whom the sound might come. But soon I perceived that\r\nwhen I stopped, as I did from time to time to gaze over the parapet,\r\nthe mysterious footsteps stopped also, and when I resumed my walk the\r\nquiet shuffling tread began again. At first I thought it might be an\r\necho; but a moment\'s reflection dispelled that idea. Mine was an even,\r\ndistinct walk, and this which followed was a soft, quick, shuffling\r\nstep--a mere scuffle. Moreover, when, by way of test, I took a few\r\nsilent steps on tip-toe, the shuffle still persisted. I was being\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nNow I do not know whether or not it may sound like a childish fancy,\r\nbut I confess I thought of my father. When last I had been in England,\r\nas a child, my father\'s violent death had been preceded by just such\r\nfollowings. And now after all these years, on my return, on the very\r\nfirst night I walked abroad alone, there were strange footsteps in\r\nmy track. The walk was narrow, and nobody could possibly pass me\r\nunseen. I turned suddenly, therefore, and hastened back. At once I\r\nsaw a dark figure rise from the shadow of the parapet and run. I ran\r\ntoo, but I could not gain on the figure, which receded farther and\r\nmore indistinctly before me. One reason was that I felt doubtful of\r\nmy footing on the unfamiliar track. I ceased my chase, and continued\r\nmy stroll. It might easily have been some vagrant thief, I thought,\r\nwho had a notion to rush, at a convenient opportunity, and snatch my\r\nwatch. But here I was far past the spot where I had turned there was\r\nthe shuffling footstep behind me again. For a little while I feigned\r\nnot to notice it; then, swinging round as swiftly as I could, I made a\r\nquick rush. Useless again, for there in the distance scuttled that same\r\nindistinct figure, more rapidly than I could run. What did it mean? I\r\nliked the affair so little that I left the walls and walked toward my\r\nhotel.\r\n\r\nThe streets were quiet. I had traversed two, and was about emerging\r\ninto one of the two main streets, where the Rows are, when, from the\r\nfarther part of the dark street behind me, there came once more the\r\nsound of the now unmistakable footstep. I stopped; the footsteps\r\nstopped also. I turned and walked back a few steps, and as I did it the\r\nsounds went scuffling away at the far end of the street.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I MADE A QUICK RUSH."]\r\n\r\nIt could not be fancy. It could not be chance. For a single incident\r\nperhaps such an explanation might serve, but not for this persistent\r\nrecurrence. I hurried away to my hotel, resolved, since I could not\r\ncome at my pursuer, to turn back no more. But before I reached the\r\nhotel there were the shuffling footsteps again, and not far behind.\r\n\r\nIt would not be true to say that I was alarmed at this stage of the\r\nadventure, but I was troubled to know what it all might mean, and\r\naltogether puzzled to account for it. I thought a great deal, but I\r\nwent to bed and rose in the morning no wiser than ever.\r\n\r\nWhether or not it was a mere fancy induced by the last night\'s\r\nexperience I cannot say, but I went about that day with a haunting\r\nfeeling that I was watched, and to me the impression was very real\r\nindeed. I listened often, but in the bustle of the day, even in quiet\r\nold Chester, the individual characters of different footsteps were not\r\neasily recognisable. Once, however, as I descended a flight of steps\r\nfrom the Rows, I fancied I heard the quick shuffle in the curious old\r\ngallery I had just quitted. I turned up the steps again and looked.\r\nThere was a shabby sort of man looking in one of the windows, and\r\nleaning so far as to hide his head behind the heavy oaken pilaster\r\nthat supported the building above. It might have been his footstep,\r\nor it might have been my fancy. At any rate I would have a look at\r\nhim. I mounted the top stair, but as I turned in his direction the\r\nman ran off, with his face averted and his head ducked, and vanished\r\ndown another stair. I made all speed after him, but when I reached the\r\nstreet he was nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\nWhat _could_ it all mean? The man was rather above the middle height,\r\nand he wore one of those soft felt hats familiar on the head of the\r\nLondon organ-grinder. Also his hair was black and bushy, and protruded\r\nover the back of his coat-collar. Surely _this_ was no delusion; surely\r\nI was not imagining an Italian aspect for this man simply because of\r\nthe recollection of my father\'s fate?\r\n\r\nPerhaps I was foolish, but I took no more pleasure in Chester. The\r\nembarrassment was a novel one for me, and I could not forget it. I went\r\nback to my hotel, paid my bill, sent my bag to the railway station, and\r\ntook train for Warwick by way of Crewe.\r\n\r\nIt was dark when I arrived, but the night was near as fine as last\r\nnight had been at Chester. I took a very little late dinner at my\r\nhotel, and fell into a doubt what to do with myself. One rather fat\r\nand very sleepy commercial traveller was the only other customer\r\nvisible, and the billiard room was empty. There seemed to be nothing to\r\ndo but to light a cigar and take a walk.\r\n\r\nI could just see enough of the old town to give me good hopes of\r\nto-morrow\'s sight-seeing. There was nothing visible of quite such an\r\ninteresting character as one might meet in Chester, but there were a\r\ngood few fine old sixteenth century houses, and there were the two\r\ngates with the chapels above them. But of course the castle was the\r\ngreat show-place, and that I should visit on the morrow, if there were\r\nno difficulties as to permission. There were some very fine pictures\r\nthere, if I remembered aright what I had read. I was walking down the\r\nincline from one of the gates, trying to remember who the painters of\r\nthese pictures were, besides Van Dyck and Holbein, when--that shuffling\r\nstep was behind me again!\r\n\r\nI admit that it cost me an effort, this time, to turn on my pursuer.\r\nThere was something uncanny in that persistent, elusive footstep,\r\nand indeed there was something alarming in my circumstances, dogged\r\nthus from place to place, and unable to shake off my enemy, or to\r\nunderstand his movements or his motive. Turn I did, however, and\r\nstraightway the shuffling step went off at a hastened pace in the\r\nshadow of the gate. This time I made no more than half-a-dozen steps\r\nback. I turned again, and pushed my way to the hotel. And as I went the\r\nshuffling step came after.\r\n\r\nThe thing was serious. There must be some object in this unceasing\r\nwatching, and the object could bode no good to me. Plainly some unseen\r\neye had been on me the whole of that day, had noted my goings and\r\ncomings and my journey from Chester. Again, and irresistibly, the\r\nwatchings that preceded my father\'s death came to mind, and I could not\r\nforget them. I could have no doubt now that I had been closely watched\r\nfrom the moment I had set foot at Plymouth. But who could have been\r\nwaiting to watch me at Plymouth, when indeed I had only decided to land\r\nat the last moment? Then I thought of the two Italian forecastle hands\r\non the steamer--the very men whom Dorrington had used to illustrate\r\nin what unexpected quarters members of the terrible Italian secret\r\nsocieties might be found. And the Camorra was not satisfied with single\r\nrevenge; it destroyed the son after the father, and it waited for many\r\nyears, with infinite patience and cunning.\r\n\r\nDogged by the steps, I reached the hotel and went to bed. I slept but\r\nfitfully at first, though better rest came as the night wore on. In\r\nthe early morning I woke with a sudden shock, and with an indefinite\r\nsense of being disturbed by somebody about me. The window was directly\r\nopposite the foot of the bed, and there, as I looked, was the face of\r\na man, dark, evil, and grinning, with a bush of black hair about his\r\nuncovered head, and small rings in his ears.\r\n\r\nIt was but a flash, and the face vanished. I was struck by the terror\r\nthat one so often feels on a sudden and violent awakening from sleep,\r\nand it was some seconds ere I could leave my bed and get to the\r\nwindow. My room was on the first floor, and the window looked down on\r\na stable-yard. I had a momentary glimpse of a human figure leaving the\r\ngate of the yard, and it was the figure that had fled before me in\r\nthe Rows, at Chester. A ladder belonging to the yard stood under the\r\nwindow, and that was all.\r\n\r\nI rose and dressed; I could stand this sort of thing no longer. If\r\nit were only something tangible, if there were only somebody I could\r\ntake hold of, and fight with if necessary, it would not have been so\r\nbad. But I was surrounded by some mysterious machination, persistent,\r\nunexplainable, that it was altogether impossible to tackle or to face.\r\nTo complain to the police would have been absurd--they would take me\r\nfor a lunatic. They are indeed just such complaints that lunatics so\r\noften make to the police--complaints of being followed by indefinite\r\nenemies, and of being besieged by faces that look in at windows.\r\nEven if they did not set me down a lunatic, what could the police of\r\na provincial town do for me in a case like this? No, I must go and\r\nconsult Dorrington.\r\n\r\nI had my breakfast, and then decided that I would at any rate try the\r\ncastle before leaving. Try it I did accordingly, and was allowed to go\r\nover it. But through the whole morning I was oppressed by the horrible\r\nsense of being watched by malignant eyes. Clearly there was no comfort\r\nfor me while this lasted; so after lunch I caught a train which brought\r\nme to Euston soon after half-past six.\r\n\r\nI took a cab straight to Dorrington\'s rooms, but he was out, and was\r\nnot expected home till late. So I drove to a large hotel near Charing\r\nCross--I avoid mentioning its name for reasons which will presently be\r\nunderstood--sent in my bag, and dined.\r\n\r\nI had not the smallest doubt but that I was still under the observation\r\nof the man or the men who had so far pursued me; I had, indeed, no\r\nhope of eluding them, except by the contrivance of Dorrington\'s\r\nexpert brain. So as I had no desire to hear that shuffling footstep\r\nagain--indeed it had seemed, at Warwick, to have a physically painful\r\neffect on my nerves--I stayed within and got to bed early.\r\n\r\nI had no fear of waking face to face with a grinning Italian here. My\r\nwindow was four floors up, out of reach of anything but a fire-escape.\r\nAnd, in fact, I woke comfortably and naturally, and saw nothing from\r\nmy window but the bright sky, the buildings opposite, and the traffic\r\nbelow. But as I turned to close my door behind me as I emerged into the\r\ncorridor, there, on the muntin of the frame, just below the bedroom\r\nnumber, was a little round paper label, perhaps a trifle smaller than a\r\nsixpence, and on the label, drawn awkwardly in ink, was a device of two\r\ncrossed knives of curious, crooked shape. The sign of the Camorra!\r\n\r\nI will not attempt to describe the effect of this sign upon me. It\r\nmay best be imagined, in view of what I have said of the incidents\r\npreceding the murder of my father. It was the sign of an inexorable\r\nfate, creeping nearer step by step, implacable, inevitable, and\r\nmysterious. In little more than twelve hours after seeing that sign my\r\nfather had been a mangled corpse. One of the hotel servants passed as I\r\nstood by the door, and I made shift to ask him if he knew anything of\r\nthe label. He looked at the paper, and then, more curiously, at me, but\r\nhe could offer no explanation. I spent little time over breakfast, and\r\nthen went by cab to Conduit Street. I paid my bill and took my bag with\r\nme.\r\n\r\nDorrington had gone to his office, but he had left a message that if\r\nI called I was to follow him; and the office was in Bedford Street,\r\nCovent Garden. I turned the cab in that direction forthwith.\r\n\r\n"Why," said Dorrington as we shook hands, "I believe you look a bit out\r\nof sorts! Doesn\'t England agree with you?"\r\n\r\n"Well," I answered, "it has proved rather trying so far." And then I\r\ndescribed, in exact detail, my adventures as I have set them down here.\r\n\r\nDorrington looked grave. "It\'s really extraordinary," he said, "most\r\nextraordinary; and it isn\'t often that I call a thing extraordinary\r\nneither, with my experience. But it\'s plain something must be\r\ndone--something to gain time at any rate. We\'re in the dark at present,\r\nof course, and I expect I shall have to fish about a little before I\r\nget at anything to go on. In the meantime I think you must disappear\r\nas artfully as we can manage it." He sat silent for a little while,\r\nthoughtfully tapping his forehead with his finger-tips. "I wonder," he\r\nsaid presently, "whether or not those Italian fellows on the steamer\r\n_are_ in it or not. I suppose you haven\'t made yourself known anywhere,\r\nhave you?"\r\n\r\n"Nowhere. As you know, you\'ve been with me all the time till you left\r\nthe moor, and since then I have been with nobody and called on nobody."\r\n\r\n"Now there\'s no doubt it\'s the Camorra," Dorrington said--"that\'s\r\npretty plain. I think I told you on the steamer that it was rather\r\nwonderful that you had heard nothing of them after your father\'s death.\r\nWhat has caused them all this delay there\'s no telling--they know\r\nbest themselves; it\'s been lucky for you, anyway, so far. What I\'d\r\nlike to find out now is how they have identified you, and got on your\r\ntrack so promptly. There\'s no guessing where these fellows get their\r\ninformation--it\'s just wonderful; but if we can find out, then perhaps\r\nwe can stop the supply, or turn on something that will lead them into a\r\npit. If you had called anywhere on business and declared yourself--as\r\nyou might have done, for instance, at Mowbray\'s--I might be inclined to\r\nsuspect that they got the tip in some crooked way from there. But you\r\nhaven\'t. Of course, if those Italian chaps on the steamer _are_ in it,\r\nyou\'re probably identified pretty certainly; but if they\'re not, they\r\nmay only have made a guess. We two landed together, and kept together,\r\ntill a day or two ago; as far as any outsider would know, I might be\r\nRigby and you might be Dorrington. Come, we\'ll work on those lines. I\r\nthink I smell a plan. Are you staying anywhere?"\r\n\r\n"No. I paid my bill at the hotel and came along here with my bag."\r\n\r\n"Very well. Now there\'s a house at Highgate kept by a very trustworthy\r\nman, whom I know very well, where a man might be pretty comfortable\r\nfor a few days, or even for a week, if he doesn\'t mind staying indoors,\r\nand keeping himself out of sight. I expect your friends of the Camorra\r\nare watching in the street outside at this moment; but I think it will\r\nbe fairly easy to get you away to Highgate without letting them into\r\nthe secret, if you don\'t mind secluding yourself for a bit. In the\r\ncircumstances, I take it you won\'t object at all?"\r\n\r\n"Object? I should think not."\r\n\r\n"Very well, that\'s settled. You can call yourself Dorrington or not, as\r\nyou please, though perhaps it will be safest not to shout \'Rigby\' too\r\nloud. But as for myself, for a day or two at least I\'m going to be Mr.\r\nJames Rigby. Have you your card-case handy?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, here it is. But then, as to taking my name, won\'t you run serious\r\nrisk?"\r\n\r\nDorrington winked merrily. "I\'ve run a risk or two before now," he\r\nsaid, "in course of my business. And if _I_ don\'t mind the risk, you\r\nneedn\'t grumble, for I warn you I shall charge for risk when I send you\r\nmy bill. And I think I can take care of myself fairly well, even with\r\nthe Camorra about. I shall take you to this place at Highgate, and then\r\nyou won\'t see me for a few days. It won\'t do for me, in the character\r\nof Mr. James Rigby, to go dragging a trail up and down between this\r\nplace and your retreat. You\'ve got some other identifying papers,\r\nhaven\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have." I produced the letter from my Sydney lawyers to Mowbray,\r\nand the deeds of the South Australian property from my bag.\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Dorrington, "I\'ll just give you a formal receipt for these,\r\nsince they\'re valuable; it\'s a matter of business, and we\'ll do it in\r\na business-like way. I may want something solid like this to support\r\nany bluff I may have to make. A mere case of cards won\'t always act,\r\nyou know. It\'s a pity old Mowbray\'s out of town, for there\'s a way in\r\nwhich he might give a little help, I fancy. But never mind--leave it\r\nall to me. There\'s your receipt. Keep it snug away somewhere, where\r\ninquisitive people can\'t read it."\r\n\r\nHe handed me the receipt, and then took me to his partner\'s room\r\nand introduced me. Mr. Hicks was a small, wrinkled man, older than\r\nDorrington, I should think, by fifteen or twenty years, and with all\r\nthe aspect and manner of a quiet old professional man.\r\n\r\nDorrington left the room, and presently returned with his hat in his\r\nhand. "Yes," he said, "there\'s a charming dark gentleman with a head\r\nlike a mop, and rings in his ears, skulking about at the next corner.\r\nIf it was he who looked in at your window, I don\'t wonder you were\r\nstartled. His dress suggests the organ-grinding interest, but he looks\r\nas though cutting a throat would be more in his line than grinding a\r\ntune; and no doubt he has friends as engaging as himself close at call.\r\nIf you\'ll come with me now I think we shall give him the slip. I have\r\na growler ready for you--a hansom\'s a bit too glassy and public. Pull\r\ndown the blinds and sit back when you get inside."\r\n\r\nHe led me to a yard at the back of the building wherein the office\r\nstood, from which a short flight of steps led to a basement. We\r\nfollowed a passage in this basement till we reached another flight, and\r\nascending these, we emerged into the corridor of another building. Out\r\nat the door at the end of this, and we passed a large block of model\r\ndwellings, and were in Bedfordbury. Here a four-wheeler was waiting,\r\nand I shut myself in it without delay.\r\n\r\nI was to proceed as far as King\'s Cross in this cab, Dorrington had\r\narranged, and there he would overtake me in a swift hansom. It fell out\r\nas he had settled, and, dismissing the hansom, he came the rest of the\r\njourney with me in the four-wheeler.\r\n\r\nWe stopped at length before one of a row of houses, apparently recently\r\nbuilt--houses of the over-ornamented, gabled and tiled sort that abound\r\nin the suburbs.\r\n\r\n"Crofting is the man\'s name," Dorrington said, as we alighted. "He\'s\r\nrather an odd sort of customer, but quite decent in the main, and his\r\nwife makes coffee such as money won\'t buy in most places."\r\n\r\nA woman answered Dorrington\'s ring--a woman of most extreme thinness.\r\nDorrington greeted her as Mrs. Crofting, and we entered.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve just lost our servant again, Mr. Dorrington," the woman said in\r\na shrill voice, "and Mr. Crofting ain\'t at home. But I\'m expecting him\r\nbefore long."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I need wait to see him, Mrs. Crofting," Dorrington\r\nanswered. "I\'m sure I can\'t leave my friend in better hands than yours.\r\nI hope you\'ve a vacant room?"\r\n\r\n"Well, for a friend of yours, Mr. Dorrington, no doubt we can find\r\nroom."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right. My friend Mr."--Dorrington gave me a meaning look--"Mr.\r\nPhelps, would like to stay here for a few days. He wants to be quite\r\nquiet for a little--do you understand?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, Mr. Dorrington, I understand."\r\n\r\n"Very well, then, make him as comfortable as you can, and give him\r\nsome of your very best coffee. I believe you\'ve got quite a little\r\nlibrary of books, and Mr. Phelps will be glad of them. Have you got any\r\ncigars?" Dorrington added, turning to me.\r\n\r\n"Yes; there are some in my bag."\r\n\r\n"Then I think you\'ll be pretty comfortable now. Goodbye. I expect\r\nyou\'ll see me in a few days--or at any rate you\'ll get a message.\r\nMeantime be as happy as you can."\r\n\r\nDorrington left, and the woman showed me to a room upstairs, where I\r\nplaced my bag. In front, on the same floor, was a sitting-room, with,\r\nI suppose, some two or three hundred books, mostly novels, on shelves.\r\nThe furniture of the place was of the sort one expects to find in an\r\nordinary lodging-house--horsehair sofas, loo tables, lustres, and so\r\nforth. Mrs. Crofting explained to me that the customary dinner hour\r\nwas two, but that I might dine when I liked. I elected, however, to\r\nfollow the custom of the house, and sat down to a cigar and a book.\r\n\r\nAt two o\'clock the dinner came, and I was agreeably surprised to find\r\nit a very good one, much above what the appointments of the house had\r\nled me to expect. Plainly Mrs. Crofting was a capital cook. There\r\nwas no soup, but there was a very excellent sole, and some well-done\r\ncutlets with peas, and an omelet; also a bottle of Bass. Come, I felt\r\nthat I should not do so badly in this place after all. I trusted that\r\nDorrington would be as comfortable in his half of the transaction,\r\nbearing my responsibilities and troubles. I had heard a heavy,\r\nblundering tread on the floor below, and judged from this that Mr.\r\nCrofting had returned.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner I lit a cigar, and Mrs. Crofting brought her coffee. Truly\r\nit was excellent coffee, and brewed as I like it--strong and black,\r\nand plenty of it. It had a flavour of its own too, novel, but not\r\nunpleasing. I took one cupful, and brought another to my side as I lay\r\non the sofa with my book. I had not read six lines before I was asleep.\r\n\r\nI woke with a sensation of numbing cold in my right side, a terrible\r\nstiffness in my limbs, and a sound of loud splashing in my ears. All\r\nwas pitch dark, and--what was this? Water! Water all about me. I was\r\nlying in six inches of cold water, and more was pouring down upon me\r\nfrom above. My head was afflicted with a splitting ache. But where was\r\nI? Why was it dark? And whence all the water? I staggered to my feet,\r\nand instantly struck my head against a hard roof above me. I raised my\r\nhand; there was the roof or whatever place it was, hard, smooth and\r\ncold, and little more than five feet from the floor, so that I bent as\r\nI stood. I spread my hand to the side; that was hard, smooth and cold\r\ntoo. And then the conviction struck me like a blow--I was in a covered\r\niron tank, and the water was pouring in to drown me!\r\n\r\nI dashed my hands frantically against the lid, and strove to raise it.\r\nIt would not move. I shouted at the top of my voice, and turned about\r\nto feel the extent of my prison. One way I could touch the opposite\r\nsides at once easily with my hands, the other way it was wider--perhaps\r\na little more than six feet altogether. What was this? Was this to be\r\nmy fearful end, cooped in this tank while the water rose by inches\r\nto choke me? Already the water was a foot deep. I flung myself at the\r\nsides, I beat the pitiless iron with fists, face and head, I screamed\r\nand implored. Then it struck me that I might at least stop the inlet\r\nof water. I put out my hand and felt the falling stream, then found\r\nthe inlet and stopped it with my fingers. But water still poured in\r\nwith a resounding splash; there was another opening at the opposite\r\nend, which I could not reach without releasing the one I now held! I\r\nwas but prolonging my agony. Oh, the devilish cunning that had devised\r\nthose two inlets, so far apart! Again I beat the sides, broke my nails\r\nwith tearing at the corners, screamed and entreated in my agony. I was\r\nmad, but with no dulling of the senses, for the horrors of my awful,\r\nhelpless state, overwhelmed my brain, keen and perceptive to every\r\nripple of the unceasing water.\r\n\r\nIn the height of my frenzy I held my breath, for I heard a sound from\r\noutside. I shouted again--implored some quicker death. Then there was a\r\nscraping on the lid above me, and it was raised at one edge, and let in\r\nthe light of a candle. I sprang from my knees and forced the lid back,\r\nand the candle flame danced before me. The candle was held by a dusty\r\nman, a workman apparently, who stared at me with scared eyes, and said\r\nnothing but, "Goo\' lor\'!"\r\n\r\nOverhead were the rafters of a gabled roof, and tilted against them was\r\nthe thick beam which, jammed across from one sloping rafter to another,\r\nhad held the tank-lid fast. "Help me!" I gasped. "Help me out!"\r\n\r\nThe man took me by the armpits and hauled me, dripping and half dead,\r\nover the edge of the tank, into which the water still poured, making\r\na noise in the hollow iron that half drowned our voices. The man had\r\nbeen at work on the cistern of a neighbouring house, and hearing an\r\nuncommon noise, he had climbed through the spaces left in the party\r\nwalls to give passage along under the roofs to the builders\' men. Among\r\nthe joists at our feet was the trap-door through which, drugged and\r\ninsensible, I had been carried, to be flung into that horrible cistern.\r\n\r\nWith the help of my friend the workman I made shift to climb through\r\nby the way he had come. We got back to the house where he had been at\r\nwork, and there the people gave me brandy and lent me dry clothes. I\r\nmade haste to send for the police, but when they arrived Mrs. Crofting\r\nand her respectable spouse had gone. Some unusual noise in the roof\r\nmust have warned them. And when the police, following my directions\r\nfurther, got to the offices of Dorrington and Hicks, those acute\r\nprofessional men had gone too, but in such haste that the contents of\r\nthe office, papers and everything else, had been left just as they\r\nstood.\r\n\r\nThe plot was clear now. The followings, the footsteps, the face at\r\nthe window, the label on the door--all were a mere humbug arranged by\r\nDorrington for his own purpose, which was to drive me into his power\r\nand get my papers from me. Armed with these, and with his consummate\r\naddress and knowledge of affairs, he could go to Mr. Mowbray in the\r\ncharacter of Mr. James Rigby, sell my land in South Australia, and\r\nhave the whole of my property transferred to himself from Sydney.\r\nThe rest of my baggage was at his rooms; if any further proof were\r\nrequired it might be found there. He had taken good care that I should\r\nnot meet Mr. Mowbray--who, by the way, I afterwards found had not\r\nleft his office, and had never fired a gun in his life. At first I\r\nwondered that Dorrington had not made some murderous attempt on me\r\nat the shooting place in Scotland. But a little thought convinced me\r\nthat that would have been bad policy for him. The disposal of the\r\nbody would be difficult, and he would have to account somehow for my\r\nsudden disappearance. Whereas, by the use of his Italian assistant and\r\nhis murder apparatus at Highgate I was made to efface my own trail,\r\nand could be got rid of in the end with little trouble; for my body,\r\nstripped of everything that might identify me, would be simply that\r\nof a drowned man unknown, whom nobody could identify. The whole plot\r\nwas contrived upon the information I myself had afforded Dorrington\r\nduring the voyage home. And it all sprang from his remembering the\r\nreport of my father\'s death. When the papers in the office came to\r\nbe examined, there each step in the operations was plainly revealed.\r\nThere was a code telegram from Suez directing Hicks to hire a grouse\r\nmoor. There were telegrams and letters from Scotland giving directions\r\nas to the later movements; indeed the thing was displayed completely.\r\nThe business of Dorrington and Hicks had really been that of private\r\ninquiry agents, and they had done much _bon\xc3\xa2 fide_ business; but\r\nmany of their operations had been of a more than questionable sort.\r\nAnd among their papers were found complete sets, neatly arranged in\r\ndockets, each containing in skeleton a complete history of a case.\r\nMany of these cases were of a most interesting character, and I have\r\nbeen enabled to piece together, out of the material thus supplied, the\r\nnarratives which will follow this. As to my own case, it only remains\r\nto say that as yet neither Dorrington, Hicks, nor the Croftings have\r\nbeen caught. They played in the end for a high stake (they might have\r\nmade six figures of me if they had killed me, and the first figure\r\nwould not have been a one) and they lost by a mere accident. But I have\r\noften wondered how many of the bodies which the coroners\' juries of\r\nLondon have returned to be "Found Drowned" were drowned, not where they\r\nwere picked up, but in that horrible tank at Highgate. What the drug\r\nwas that gave Mrs. Crofting\'s coffee its value in Dorrington\'s eyes I\r\ndo not know, but plainly it had not been sufficient in my case to keep\r\nme unconscious against the shock of cold water till I could be drowned\r\naltogether. Months have passed since my adventure, but even now I sweat\r\nat the sight of an iron tank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE CASE OF JANISSARY_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe Case of Janissary\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIn this case (and indeed in most of the others) the notes and other\r\ndocuments found in the dockets would, by themselves, give but a faint\r\noutline of the facts, and, indeed, might easily be unintelligible\r\nto many people, especially as for much of my information I have\r\nbeen indebted to outside inquiries. Therefore I offer no excuse for\r\npresenting the whole thing digested into plain narrative form, with\r\nlittle reference to my authorities. Though I knew none of the actors\r\nin it, with the exception of the astute Dorrington, the case was\r\nespecially interesting to me, as will be gathered from the narrative\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe only paper in the bundle which I shall particularly allude to was\r\na newspaper cutting, of a date anterior by nine or ten months to the\r\nevents I am to write of. It had evidently been cut at the time it\r\nappeared, and saved, in case it might be useful, in a box in the form\r\nof a book, containing many hundreds of others. From this receptacle it\r\nhad been taken, and attached to the bundle during the progress of the\r\ncase. I may say at once that the facts recorded had no direct concern\r\nwith the case of the horse Janissary, but had been useful in affording\r\na suggestion to Dorrington in connection therewith. The matter is the\r\nshort report of an ordinary sort of inquest, and I here transcribe it.\r\n\r\n"Dr. McCulloch held an inquest yesterday on the body of Mr. Henry\r\nLawrence, whose body was found on Tuesday morning last in the river\r\nnear Vauxhall Bridge. The deceased was well known in certain sporting\r\ncircles. Sophia Lawrence, the widow, said that deceased had left home\r\non Monday afternoon at about five, in his usual health, saying that he\r\nwas to dine at a friend\'s, and she saw nothing more of him till called\r\nupon to identify the body. He had no reason for suicide, and so far as\r\nwitness knew, was free from pecuniary embarrassments. He had, indeed,\r\nbeen very successful in betting recently. He habitually carried a\r\nlarge pocket-book, with papers in it. Mr. Robert Naylor, commission\r\nagent, said that deceased dined with him that evening at his house in\r\nGold Street, Chelsea, and left for home at about half-past eleven. He\r\nhad at the time a sum of nearly four hundred pounds upon him, chiefly\r\nin notes, which had been paid him by witness in settlement of a bet.\r\nIt was a fine night, and deceased walked in the direction of Chelsea\r\nEmbankment. That was the last witness saw of him. He might not have\r\nbeen perfectly sober, but he was not drunk, and was capable of taking\r\ncare of himself. The evidence of the Thames police went to show that\r\nno money was on the body when found, except a few coppers, and no\r\npocket-book. Dr. William Hodgetts said that death was due to drowning.\r\nThere were some bruises on the arms and head which might have been\r\ncaused before death. The body was a very healthy one. The coroner said\r\nthat there seemed to be a very strong suspicion of foul play, unless\r\nthe pocket-book of the deceased had got out of his pocket in the water;\r\nbut the evidence was very meagre, although the police appeared to have\r\nmade every possible inquiry. The jury returned a verdict of \'Found\r\nDrowned, though how the deceased came into the water there was no\r\nevidence to show.\'"\r\n\r\nI know no more of the unfortunate man Lawrence than this, and I have\r\nonly printed the cutting here because it probably induced Dorrington to\r\ntake certain steps in the case I am dealing with. With that case the\r\nfate of the man Lawrence has nothing whatever to do. He passes out of\r\nthe story entirely.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nMr. Warren Telfer was a gentleman of means, and the owner of a\r\nfew--very few--racehorses. But he had a great knack of buying hidden\r\nprizes in yearlings, and what his stable lacked in quantity it often\r\nmore than made up for in quality. Thus he had once bought a St. Leger\r\nwinner for as little as a hundred and fifty pounds. Many will remember\r\nhis bitter disappointment of ten or a dozen years back, when his horse,\r\nMatfelon, starting an odds-on favourite for the Two Thousand, never\r\neven got among the crowd, and ambled in streets behind everything. It\r\nwas freely rumoured (and no doubt with cause) that Matfelon had been\r\n"got at" and in some way "nobbled." There were hints of a certain\r\nbucket of water administered just before the race--a bucket of water\r\nobserved in the hands, some said of one, some said of another person\r\nconnected with Ritter\'s training establishment. There was no suspicion\r\nof pulling, for plainly the jockey was doing his best with the animal\r\nall the way along, and never had a tight rein. So a nobbling it must\r\nhave been, said the knowing ones, and Mr. Warren Telfer said so too,\r\nwith much bitterness. More, he immediately removed his horses from\r\nRitter\'s stables, and started a small training place of his own for his\r\nown horses merely; putting an old steeplechase jockey in charge, who\r\nhad come out of a bad accident permanently lame, and had fallen on evil\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe owner was an impulsive and violent-tempered man, who, once a\r\nnotion was in his head, held to it through everything, and in spite of\r\neverything. His misfortune with Matfelon made him the most insanely\r\ndistrustful man alive. In everything he fancied he saw a trick, and\r\nto him every man seemed a scoundrel. He could scarce bear to let the\r\nvery stable-boys touch his horses, and although for years all went as\r\nwell as could be expected in his stables, his suspicious distrust lost\r\nnothing of its virulence. He was perpetually fussing about the stables,\r\nmaking surprise visits, and laying futile traps that convicted nobody.\r\nThe sole tangible result of this behaviour was a violent quarrel\r\nbetween Mr. Warren Telfer and his nephew Richard, who had been making\r\na lengthened stay with his uncle. Young Telfer, to tell the truth, was\r\nneither so discreet nor so exemplary in behaviour as he might have\r\nbeen, but his temper was that characteristic of the family, and when he\r\nconceived that his uncle had an idea that he was communicating stable\r\nsecrets to friends outside, there was an animated row, and the nephew\r\nbetook himself and his luggage somewhere else. Young Telfer always\r\ninsisted, however, that his uncle was not a bad fellow on the whole,\r\nthough he had habits of thought and conduct that made him altogether\r\nintolerable at times. But the uncle had no good word for his graceless\r\nnephew; and indeed Richard Telfer betted more than he could afford,\r\nand was not so particular in his choice of sporting acquaintances as a\r\ngentleman should have been.\r\n\r\nMr. Warren Telfer\'s house, "Blackhall," and his stables were little\r\nmore than two miles from Redbury, in Hampshire; and after the\r\nquarrel Mr. Richard Telfer was not seen near the place for many\r\nmonths--not, indeed, till excitement was high over the forthcoming\r\nrace for the Redbury Stakes, for which there was an entry from the\r\nstable--Janissary, for long ranked second favourite; and then the\r\nowner\'s nephew did not enter the premises, and, in fact, made his visit\r\nas secret as possible.\r\n\r\nI have said that Janissary was long ranked second favourite for the\r\nRedbury Stakes, but a little more than a week before the race he became\r\nfirst favourite, owing to a training mishap to the horse fancied first,\r\nwhich made its chances so poor that it might have been scratched at any\r\nmoment. And so far was Janissary above the class of the field (though\r\nit was a two-year-old race, and there might be a surprise) that it\r\nat once went to far shorter odds than the previous favourite, which,\r\nindeed, had it run fit and well, would have found Janissary no easy\r\ncolt to beat.\r\n\r\nMr. Telfer\'s nephew was seen near the stables but two or three days\r\nbefore the race, and that day the owner despatched a telegram to the\r\nfirm of Dorrington & Hicks. In response to this telegram, Dorrington\r\ncaught the first available train for Redbury, and was with Mr. Warren\r\nTelfer in his library by five in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n"It is about my horse Janissary that I want to consult you, Mr.\r\nDorrington," said Mr. Telfer. "It\'s right enough now--or at least was\r\nright at exercise this morning--but I feel certain that there\'s some\r\ndiabolical plot on hand somewhere to interfere with the horse before\r\nthe Redbury Stakes day, and I\'m sorry to have to say that I suspect\r\nmy own nephew to be mixed up in it in some way. In the first place I\r\nmay tell you that there is no doubt whatever that the colt, if let\r\nalone, and bar accident, can win in a canter. He could have won even\r\nif Herald, the late favourite, had kept well, for I can tell you that\r\nJanissary is a far greater horse than anybody is aware of outside my\r\nestablishment--or at any rate, than anybody ought to be aware of,\r\nif the stable secrets are properly kept. His pedigree is nothing\r\nvery great, and he never showed his quality till quite lately, in\r\nprivate trials. Of course it has leaked out somehow that the colt is\r\nexceptionally good--I don\'t believe I can trust a soul in the place.\r\nHow should the price have gone up to five to four unless somebody had\r\nbeen telling what he\'s paid not to tell? But that isn\'t all, as I have\r\nsaid. I\'ve a conviction that something\'s on foot--somebody wants to\r\ninterfere with the horse. Of course we get a tout about now and again,\r\nbut the downs are pretty big, and we generally manage to dodge them\r\nif we want to. On the last three or four mornings, however, wherever\r\nJanissary might be taking his gallop, there was a big, hulking fellow,\r\nwith a red beard and spectacles--not so much watching the horse as\r\ntrying to get hold of the lad. I am always up and out at five, for I\'ve\r\nfound to my cost--you remember about Matfelon--that if a man doesn\'t\r\nwant to be ramped he must never take his eye off things. Well, I have\r\nscarcely seen the lad ease the colt once on the last three or four\r\nmornings without that red-bearded fellow bobbing up from a knoll, or a\r\nclump of bushes, or something, close by--especially if Janissary was\r\na bit away from the other horses, and not under my nose, or the head\r\nlad\'s, for a moment. I rode at the fellow, of course, when I saw what\r\nhe was after, but he was artful as a cartload of monkeys, and vanished\r\nsomehow before I could get near him. The head lad believes he has seen\r\nhim about just after dark, too; but I am keeping the stable lads in\r\nwhen they\'re not riding, and I suppose he finds he has no chance of\r\ngetting at them except when they\'re out with the horses. This morning,\r\nnot only did I see this fellow about, as usual, but, I am ashamed to\r\nsay, I observed my own nephew acting the part of a common tout. He\r\ncertainly had the decency to avoid me and clear out, but that was\r\nnot all, as you shall see. This morning, happening to approach the\r\nstables from the back, I suddenly came upon the red-bearded man--giving\r\nmoney to a groom of mine! He ran off at once, as you may guess, and I\r\ndischarged the groom where he stood, and would not allow him into the\r\nstables again. He offered no explanation or excuse, but took himself\r\noff, and half an hour afterward I almost sent away my head boy too.\r\nFor when I told him of the dismissal, he admitted that he had seen\r\nthat same groom taking money of my nephew at the back of the stables,\r\nan hour before, and had not informed me! He said that he thought that\r\nas it was \'only Mr. Richard\' it didn\'t matter. Fool! Anyway, the groom\r\nhas gone, and, so far as I can tell as yet, the colt is all right. I\r\nexamined him at once, of course; and I also turned over a box that\r\nWeeks, the groom, used to keep brushes and odd things in. There I found\r\nthis paper full of powder. I don\'t yet know what it is, but it\'s\r\ncertainly nothing he had any business with in the stable. Will you take\r\nit?\r\n\r\n"And now," Mr. Telfer went on, "I\'m in such an uneasy state that I want\r\nyour advice and assistance. Quite apart from the suspicious--more than\r\nsuspicious--circumstances I have informed you of, I am _certain_--I\r\nknow it without being able to give precise reasons--I am _certain_ that\r\nsome attempt is being made at disabling Janissary before Thursday\'s\r\nrace. I feel it in my bones, so to speak. I had the same suspicion just\r\nbefore that Two Thousand, when Matfelon was got at. The thing was in\r\nthe air, as it is now. Perhaps it\'s a sort of instinct; but I rather\r\nthink it is the result of an unconscious absorption of a number of\r\nlittle indications about me. Be it as it may, I am resolved to leave no\r\nopening to the enemy if I can help it, and I want you to see if you can\r\nsuggest any further precautions beyond those I am taking. Come and look\r\nat the stables."\r\n\r\nDorrington could see no opening for any piece of rascality by which he\r\nmight make more of the case than by serving his client loyally, so he\r\nresolved to do the latter. He followed Mr. Telfer through the training\r\nstables, where eight or nine thoroughbreds stood, and could suggest no\r\nimprovement upon the exceptional precautions that already existed.\r\n\r\n"No," said Dorrington, "I don\'t think you can do any better than\r\nthis--at least on this, the inner line of defence. But it is best to\r\nmake the outer lines secure first. By the way, _this_ isn\'t Janissary,\r\nis it? We saw him farther up the row, didn\'t we?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, that\'s a very different sort of colt, though he does look like,\r\ndoesn\'t he? People who\'ve been up and down the stables once or twice\r\noften confuse them. They\'re both bays, much of a build, and about the\r\nsame height, and both have a bit of stocking on the same leg, though\r\nJanissary\'s is bigger, and this animal has a white star. But you never\r\nsaw two creatures look so like and run so differently. This is a dead\r\nloss--not worth his feed. If I can manage to wind him up to something\r\nlike a gallop I shall try to work him off in a selling plate somewhere;\r\nbut as far as I can see he isn\'t good enough even for that. He\'s a\r\ndisappointment. And his stock\'s far better than Janissary\'s too, and he\r\ncost half as much again! Yearlings are a lottery. Still, I\'ve drawn a\r\nprize or two among them, at one time or another."\r\n\r\n"Ah yes, so I\'ve heard. But now as to the outer defences I was speaking\r\nof. Let us find out _who_ is trying to interfere with your horse. Do\r\nyou mind letting me into the secrets of the stable commissions?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no. We\'re talking in confidence, of course. I\'ve backed the colt\r\npretty heavily all round, but not too much anywhere. There\'s a good\r\nslice with Barker--you know Barker, of course; Mullins has a thousand\r\ndown for him, and that was at five to one, before Herald went amiss.\r\nThen there\'s Ford and Lascelles--both good men, and Naylor--he\'s the\r\nsmallest man of them all, and there\'s only a hundred or two with him,\r\nthough he\'s been laying the horse pretty freely everywhere, at least\r\nuntil Herald went wrong. And there\'s Pedder. But there must have been a\r\ndeal of money laid to outside backers, and there\'s no telling who may\r\ncontemplate a ramp."\r\n\r\n"Just so. Now as to your nephew. What of your suspicions in that\r\ndirection?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I\'m a little hasty as to that," Mr. Telfer answered, a\r\nlittle ashamed of what he had previously said. "But I\'m worried\r\nand mystified, as you see, and hardly know what to think. My nephew\r\nRichard is a little erratic, and he has a foolish habit of betting more\r\nthan he can afford. He and I quarrelled some time back, while he was\r\nstaying here, because I had an idea that he had been talking too freely\r\noutside. He had, in fact; and I regarded it as a breach of confidence.\r\nSo there was a quarrel and he went away."\r\n\r\n"Very well. I wonder if I can get a bed at the \'Crown,\' at Redbury? I\'m\r\nafraid it\'ll be crowded, but I\'ll try."\r\n\r\n"But why trouble? Why not stay with me, and be near the stables?"\r\n\r\n"Because then I should be of no more use to you than one of your lads.\r\nPeople who come out here every morning are probably staying at Redbury,\r\nand I must go there after them."\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe "Crown" at Redbury was full in anticipation of the races, but\r\nDorrington managed to get a room ordinarily occupied by one of the\r\nlandlord\'s family, who undertook to sleep at a friend\'s for a night\r\nor two. This settled, he strolled into the yard, and soon fell into\r\nanimated talk with the hostler on the subject of the forthcoming races.\r\nAll the town was backing Janissary for the Stakes, the hostler said,\r\nand he advised Dorrington to do the same.\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation two men stopped in the street, just outside\r\nthe yard gate, talking. One was a big, heavy, vulgar-looking fellow in\r\na box-cloth coat, and with a shaven face and hoarse voice; the other\r\nwas a slighter, slimmer, younger and more gentlemanlike man, though\r\nthere was a certain patchy colour about his face that seemed to hint of\r\nanything but teetotalism.\r\n\r\n"There," said the hostler, indicating the younger of these two men,\r\n"that\'s young Mr. Telfer, him as whose uncle\'s owner o\' Janissary. He\'s\r\na young plunger, he is, and he\'s on Janissary too. He give me the tip,\r\nstraight, this mornin\'. \'You put your little bit on my uncle\'s colt,\'\r\nhe said. \'It\'s all right. I ain\'t such pals with the old man as I was,\r\nbut I\'ve got the tip that _his_ money\'s down on it. So don\'t neglect\r\nyour opportunities, Thomas,\' he says; and I haven\'t. He\'s stoppin\' in\r\nour house, is young Mr. Richard."\r\n\r\n"And who is that he is talking to? A bookmaker?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, that\'s Naylor--Bob Naylor. He\'s got Mr. Richard\'s bets.\r\nP\'raps he\'s puttin\' on a bit more now."\r\n\r\nThe men at the gate separated, and the bookmaker walked off down the\r\nstreet in the fast gathering dusk. Richard Telfer, however, entered the\r\nhouse, and Dorrington followed him. Telfer mounted the stairs and went\r\ninto his room. Dorrington lingered a moment on the stairs and then went\r\nand knocked at Telfer\'s door.\r\n\r\n"Hullo!" cried Telfer, coming to the door and peering out into the\r\ngloomy corridor.\r\n\r\n"I beg pardon," Dorrington replied courteously. "I thought this was\r\nNaylor\'s room."\r\n\r\n"No--it\'s No. 23, by the end. But I believe he\'s just gone down the\r\nstreet."\r\n\r\nDorrington expressed his thanks and went to his own room. He took one\r\nor two small instruments from his bag and hurried stealthily to the\r\ndoor of No. 23.\r\n\r\nAll was quiet, and the door opened at once to Dorrington\'s picklock,\r\nfor there was nothing but the common tumbler rim-lock to secure\r\nit. Dorrington, being altogether an unscrupulous scoundrel, would\r\nhave thought nothing of entering a man\'s room thus for purposes of\r\nmere robbery. Much less scruple had he in doing so in the present\r\ncircumstances. He lit the candle in a little pocket lantern, and,\r\nhaving secured the door, looked quickly about the room. There was\r\nnothing unusual to attract his attention, and he turned to two\r\nbags lying near the dressing-table. One was the usual bookmaker\'s\r\nsatchel, and the other was a leather travelling-bag; both were locked.\r\nDorrington unbuckled the straps of the large bag, and produced a\r\nslender picklock of steel wire, with a sliding joint, which, with a\r\nlittle skilful "humouring," turned the lock in the course of a minute\r\nor two. One glance inside was enough. There on the top lay a large\r\nfalse beard of strong red, and upon the shirts below was a pair of\r\nspectacles. But Dorrington went farther, and felt carefully below the\r\nlinen till his hand met a small, flat, mahogany box. This he withdrew\r\nand opened. Within, on a velvet lining, lay a small silver instrument\r\nresembling a syringe. He shut and replaced the box, and, having\r\nrearranged the contents of the bag, shut, locked and strapped it, and\r\nblew out his light. He had found what he came to look for. In another\r\nminute Mr. Bob Naylor\'s door was locked behind him, and Dorrington took\r\nhis picklocks to his own room.\r\n\r\nIt was a noisy evening in the Commercial Room at the "Crown." Chaff\r\nand laughter flew thick, and Richard Telfer threatened Naylor with a\r\nterrible settling day. More was drunk than thirst strictly justified,\r\nand everybody grew friendly with everybody else. Dorrington, sober and\r\nkeenly alert, affected the reverse, and exhibited especial and extreme\r\naffection for Mr. Bob Naylor. His advances were unsuccessful at first,\r\nbut Dorrington\'s manner and the "Crown" whisky overcame the bookmaker\'s\r\nreserve, and at about eleven o\'clock the two left the house arm in\r\narm for a cooling stroll in the High Street. Dorrington blabbed and\r\nchattered with great success, and soon began about Janissary.\r\n\r\n"So you\'ve pretty well done all you want with Janissary, eh? Book\r\nfull? Ah! nothing like keeping a book even all round--it\'s the safest\r\nway--\'specially with such a colt as Janissary about. Eh, my boy?" He\r\nnudged Naylor genially. "Ah! no doubt it\'s a good colt, but old Telfer\r\nhas rum notions about preparation, hasn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"I dunno," replied Naylor. "How do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Why, what does he have the horse led up and down behind the stable\r\nfor, half an hour every afternoon?"\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t know he did."\r\n\r\n"Ah! but he does. I came across it only this afternoon. I was coming\r\nover the downs, and just as I got round behind Telfer\'s stables there\r\nI saw a fine bay colt, with a white stocking on the off hind leg, well\r\ncovered up in a suit of clothes, being led up and down by a lad, like\r\na sentry--up and down, up and down--about twenty yards each way, and\r\nnobody else about. \'Hullo!\' says I to the lad, \'hullo! what horse is\r\nthis?\' \'Janissary,\' says the boy--pretty free for a stable-lad. \'Ah!\'\r\nsays I. \'And what are you walking him like that for?\' \'Dunno,\' says the\r\nboy, \'but it\'s guv\'nor\'s orders. Every afternoon, at two to the minute,\r\nI have to bring him out here and walk him like this for half an hour\r\nexactly, neither more nor less, and then he goes in and has a handful\r\nof malt. But I dunno why.\' \'Well,\' says I, \'I never heard of that being\r\ndone before. But he\'s a fine colt,\' and I put my hand under the cloth\r\nand felt him--hard as nails and smooth as silk."\r\n\r\n"And the boy let you touch him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; he struck me as a bit easy for a stable-boy. But it\'s an odd\r\ntrick, isn\'t it, that of the half-hour\'s walk and the handful of malt?\r\nNever hear of anybody else doing it, did you?"\r\n\r\n"No, I never did."\r\n\r\nThey talked and strolled for another quarter of an hour, and then\r\nfinished up with one more drink.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe next was the day before the race, and in the morning Dorrington,\r\nmaking a circuit, came to Mr. Warren Telfer\'s from the farther side. As\r\nsoon as they were assured of privacy: "Have you seen the man with the\r\nred beard this morning?" asked Dorrington.\r\n\r\n"No; I looked out pretty sharply, too."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right. If you like to fall in with my suggestions, however, you\r\nshall see him at about two o\'clock, and take a handsome rise out of\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Very well," Mr. Telfer replied. "What\'s your suggestion?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you. In the first place, what\'s the value of that other\r\nhorse that looks so like Janissary?"\r\n\r\n"Hamid is his name. He\'s worth--well, what he will fetch. I\'ll sell him\r\nfor fifty and be glad of the chance."\r\n\r\n"Very good. Then you\'ll no doubt be glad to risk his health temporarily\r\nto make sure of the Redbury Stakes, and to get longer prices for\r\nanything you may like to put on between now and to-morrow afternoon.\r\nCome to the stables and I\'ll tell you. But first, is there a place\r\nwhere we may command a view of the ground behind the stables without\r\nbeing seen?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, there\'s a ventilation grating at the back of each stall."\r\n\r\n"Good! Then we\'ll watch from Hamid\'s stall, which will be empty. Select\r\nyour most wooden-faced and most careful boy, and send him out behind\r\nthe stable with Hamid at two o\'clock to the moment. Put the horse in a\r\nfull suit of clothes--it is necessary to cover up that white star--and\r\ntell the lad he must _lead_ it up and down slowly for twenty yards or\r\nso. I rather expect the red-bearded man will be coming along between\r\ntwo o\'clock and half-past two. You will understand that Hamid is to\r\nbe Janissary for the occasion. You must drill your boy to appear a\r\nbit of a fool, and to overcome his stable education sufficiently to\r\nchatter freely--so long as it is the proper chatter. The man may ask\r\nthe horse\'s name, or he may not. Any way, the boy mustn\'t forget it is\r\nJanissary he is leading. You have an odd fad, you must know (and the\r\nboy must know it too) in the matter of training. This ridiculous fad is\r\nto have your colt walked up and down for half an hour exactly at two\r\no\'clock every afternoon, and then given a handful of malt as he comes\r\nin. The boy can talk as freely about this as he pleases, and also about\r\nthe colt\'s chances, and anything else he likes; and he is to let the\r\nstranger come up, talk to the horse, pat him--in short, to do as he\r\npleases. Is that plain?"\r\n\r\n"Perfectly. You have found out something about this red-bearded chap\r\nthen?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes--it\'s Naylor the bookmaker, as a matter of fact, with a false\r\nbeard."\r\n\r\n"What! Naylor?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. You see the idea, of course. Once Naylor thinks he has nobbled\r\nthe favourite he will lay it to any extent, and the odds will get\r\nlonger. Then you can make him pay for his little games."\r\n\r\n"Well, yes, of course. Though I wouldn\'t put too much with Naylor in\r\nany case. He\'s not a big man, and he might break and lose me the lot.\r\nBut I can get it out of the others."\r\n\r\n"Just so. You\'d better see about schooling your boy now, I think. I\'ll\r\ntell you more presently."\r\n\r\nA minute or two before two o\'clock Dorrington and Telfer, mounted\r\non a pair of steps, were gazing through the ventilation grating of\r\nHamid\'s stall, while the colt, clothed completely, was led round. Then\r\nDorrington described his operations of the previous evening.\r\n\r\n"No matter what he may think of my tale," he said, "Naylor will be\r\npretty sure to come. He has tried to bribe your stablemen, and has been\r\nbaffled. Every attempt to get hold of the boy in charge of Janissary\r\nhas failed, and he will be glad to clutch at any shadow of a chance\r\nto save his money now. Once he is here, and the favourite apparently\r\nat his mercy, the thing is done. By the way, I expect your nephew\'s\r\nlittle present to the man you sacked was a fairly innocent one. No\r\ndoubt he merely asked the man whether Janissary was keeping well, and\r\nwas thought good enough to win, for I find he is backing it pretty\r\nheavily. Naylor came afterwards, with much less innocent intentions,\r\nbut fortunately you were down on him in time. Several considerations\r\ninduced me to go to Naylor\'s room. In the first place, I have heard\r\nrather shady tales of his doings on one or two occasions, and he did\r\nnot seem a sufficiently big man to stand to lose a great deal over\r\nyour horse. Then, when I saw him, I observed that his figure bore a\r\nconsiderable resemblance to that of the man you had described, except\r\nas regards the red beard and the spectacles--articles easily enough\r\nassumed, and, indeed, often enough used by the scum of the ring whose\r\ntrade is welshing. And, apart from these considerations, here, at\r\nany rate, was one man who had an interest in keeping your colt from\r\nwinning, and here was his room waiting for me to explore. So I explored\r\nit, and the card turned up trumps."\r\n\r\nAs he was speaking, the stable-boy, a stolid-looking youngster, was\r\nleading Hamid back and forth on the turf before their eyes.\r\n\r\n"There\'s somebody," said Dorrington suddenly, "over in that clump of\r\ntrees. Yes--our man, sure enough. I felt pretty sure of him after\r\nyou had told me that he hadn\'t thought it worth while to turn up this\r\nmorning. Here he comes."\r\n\r\nNaylor, with his red beard sticking out over the collar of his\r\nbig coat, came slouching along with an awkwardly assumed air of\r\ncarelessness and absence of mind.\r\n\r\n"Hullo!" he said suddenly, as he came abreast of the horse, turning as\r\nthough but now aware of its presence, "that\'s a valuable sort of horse,\r\nain\'t it, my lad?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the boy, "it is. He\'s goin\' to win the Redbury Stakes\r\nto-morrow. It\'s Janissary."\r\n\r\n"Oh! Janey Sairey, is it?" Naylor answered, with a quaint affectation\r\nof gaping ignorance. "Janey Sairey, eh? Well, she do look a fine \'orse,\r\nwhat I can see of \'er. What a suit o\' clo\'es! An\' so she\'s one o\' the\r\n\'orses that runs in races, is she? Well, I never! Pretty much like\r\nother \'orses, too, to look at, ain\'t she? Only a bit thin in the legs."\r\n\r\nThe boy stood carelessly by the colt\'s side, and the man approached.\r\nHis hand came quickly from an inner pocket, and then he passed it under\r\nHamid\'s cloths, near the shoulder. "Ah, it do feel a lovely skin,\r\nto be sure!" he said. "An\' so there\'s goin\' to be races at Redbury\r\nto-morrow, is there? I dunno anythin\' about races myself, an\'----Oo my!"\r\n\r\nNaylor sprang back as the horse, flinging back its ears, started\r\nsuddenly, swung round, and reared. "Lor," he said, "what a vicious\r\nbrute! Jist because I stroked her! I\'ll be careful about touching\r\nracehorses again." His hand passed stealthily to the pocket again, and\r\nhe hurried on his way, while the stable-boy steadied and soothed Hamid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "THE HORSE STARTED SUDDENLY, SWUNG ROUND, AND REARED."]\r\n\r\nTelfer and Dorrington sniggered quietly in their concealment. "He\'s\r\ntaken a deal of trouble, hasn\'t he?" Dorrington remarked. "It\'s a sad\r\ncase of the biter bit for Mr. Naylor, I\'m afraid. That was a prick the\r\ncolt felt--hypodermic injection with the syringe I saw in the bag, no\r\ndoubt. The boy won\'t be such a fool as to come in again at once, will\r\nhe? If Naylor\'s taking a look back from anywhere, that may make him\r\nsuspicious."\r\n\r\n"No fear. I\'ve told him to keep out for the half-hour, and he\'ll do it.\r\nDear, dear, what an innocent person Mr. Bob Naylor is! \'Well, I never!\r\nPretty much like other horses!\' He didn\'t know there were to be\r\nraces at Redbury! \'Janey Sairey,\' too--it\'s really very funny!"\r\n\r\nEre the half-hour was quite over, Hamid came stumbling and dragging\r\ninto the stable yard, plainly all amiss, and collapsed on his litter as\r\nsoon as he gained his stall. There he lay, shivering and drowsy.\r\n\r\n"I expect he\'ll get over it in a day or two," Dorrington remarked. "I\r\ndon\'t suppose a vet. could do much for him just now, except, perhaps,\r\ngive him a drench and let him take a rest. Certainly, the effect will\r\nlast over to-morrow. That\'s what it is calculated for."\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe Redbury Stakes were run at three in the afternoon, after two or\r\nthree minor events had been disposed of. The betting had undergone\r\nconsiderable fluctuations during the morning, but in general it ruled\r\nheavily against Janissary. The story had got about, too, that Mr.\r\nWarren Telfer\'s colt would not start. So that when the numbers went up,\r\nand it was seen that Janissary was starting after all, there was much\r\nastonishment, and a good deal of uneasiness in the ring.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a pity we can\'t see our friend Naylor\'s face just now, isn\'t it?"\r\nDorrington remarked to his client, as they looked on from Mr. Telfer\'s\r\ndrag.\r\n\r\n"Yes; it would be interesting," Telfer replied. "He was quite confident\r\nlast night, you say."\r\n\r\n"Quite. I tested him by an offer of a small bet on your colt, asking\r\nsome points over the odds, and he took it at once. Indeed, I believe\r\nhe has been going about gathering up all the wagers he could about\r\nJanissary, and the market has felt it. Your nephew has risked some more\r\nwith him, I believe, and altogether it looks as though the town would\r\nspoil the \'bookies\' badly."\r\n\r\nAs the horses came from the weighing enclosure, Janissary was seen\r\nconspicuous among them, bright, clean, and firm, and a good many faces\r\nlengthened at the sight. The start was not so good as it might have\r\nbeen, but the favourite (the starting-price had gone to evens) was not\r\nleft, and got away well in the crowd of ten starters. There he lay till\r\nrounding the bend, when the Telfer blue and chocolate was seen among\r\nthe foremost, and near the rails. Mr. Telfer almost trembled as he\r\nwatched through his glasses.\r\n\r\n"Hang that Willett!" he said, almost to himself. "He\'s _too_ clever\r\nagainst those rails before getting clear. All right, though, all right!\r\nHe\'s coming!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "CAME IN THREE LENGTHS THE WINNER."]\r\n\r\nJanissary, indeed, was showing in front, and as the horses came along\r\nthe straight it was plain that Mr. Telfer\'s colt was holding the field\r\ncomfortably. There were changes in the crowd; some dropped away, some\r\ncame out and attempted to challenge for the lead, but the favourite,\r\nstriding easily, was never seriously threatened, and in the end, being\r\na little let out, came in a three-lengths winner, never once having\r\nbeen made to show his best.\r\n\r\n"I congratulate you, Mr. Telfer," said Dorrington, "and you may\r\ncongratulate me."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, certainly," said Mr. Telfer hastily, hurrying off to lead\r\nin the winner.\r\n\r\nIt was a bad race for the ring, and in the open parts of the course\r\nmany a humble fielder grabbed his satchel ere the shouting was over,\r\nand made his best pace for the horizon; and more than one pair of false\r\nwhiskers, as red as Naylor\'s, came off suddenly while the owner betook\r\nhimself to a fresh stand. Unless a good many outsiders sailed home\r\nbefore the end of the week there would be a bad Monday for layers. But\r\nall sporting Redbury was jubilant. They had all been "on" the local\r\nfavourite for the local race, and it had won.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nMr. Bob Naylor "got a bit back," in his own phrase, on other races\r\nby the end of the week, but all the same he saw a black settling day\r\nahead. He had been done--done for a certainty. He had realised this\r\nas soon as he saw the numbers go up for the Redbury Stakes. Janissary\r\nhad not been drugged after all. That meant that another horse had\r\nbeen substituted for him, and that the whole thing was an elaborate\r\nplant. He thought he knew Janissary pretty well by sight, too, and\r\nrather prided himself on having an eye for a horse. But clearly it was\r\na plant--a complete do. Telfer was in it, and so of course was that\r\ngentlemanly stranger who had strolled along Redbury High Street with\r\nhim that night, telling that cock-and-bull story about the afternoon\r\nwalks and the handful of malt. There was a nice schoolboy tale to take\r\nin a man who thought himself broad as Cheapside! He cursed himself high\r\nand low. To be done, and to know it, was a galling thing, but this\r\nwould be worse. The tale would get about. They would boast of a clever\r\nstroke like that, and that would injure him with everybody; with honest\r\nmen, because his reputation, as it was, would bear no worsening, and\r\nwith knaves like himself, because they would laugh at him, and leave\r\nhim out when any little co-operative swindle was in contemplation. But\r\nthough the chagrin of the defeat was bitter bad enough, his losses\r\nwere worse. He had taken everything offered on Janissary after he had\r\nnobbled the wrong horse, and had given almost any odds demanded. Do as\r\nhe might, he could see nothing but a balance against him on Monday,\r\nwhich, though he might pay out his last cent, he could not cover by\r\nseveral hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nBut on the day he met his customers at his club, as usual, and paid out\r\nfreely. Young Richard Telfer, however, with whom he was heavily "in,"\r\nhe put off till the evening. "I\'ve been a bit disappointed this morning\r\nover some ready that was to be paid over," he said, "and I\'ve used the\r\nlast cheque-form in my book. You might come and have a bit of dinner\r\nwith me to-night, Mr. Telfer, and take it then."\r\n\r\nTelfer assented without difficulty.\r\n\r\n"All right, then, that\'s settled. You know the place--Gold Street.\r\nSeven sharp. The missis \'ll be pleased to see you, I\'m sure, Mr.\r\nTelfer. Let\'s see--it\'s fifteen hundred and thirty altogether, isn\'t\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s it. I\'ll come."\r\n\r\nYoung Telfer left the club, and at the corner of the street ran against\r\nDorrington. Telfer, of course, knew him but as his late fellow-guest\r\nat the "Crown" at Redbury, and this was their first meeting in London\r\nafter their return from the races.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Telfer. "Going to draw a bit of Janissary money, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I haven\'t much to draw," Dorrington answered. "But I expect your\r\npockets are pretty heavy, if you\'ve just come from Naylor."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ve just come from Naylor, but I haven\'t touched the merry sovs.\r\njust yet," replied Telfer cheerfully. "There\'s been a run on Naylor,\r\nand I\'m going to dine with him and his respectable missis this evening,\r\nand draw the plunder then. I feel rather curious to see what sort of\r\nestablishment a man like Naylor keeps going. His place is in Gold\r\nStreet, Chelsea."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I believe so. Anyhow, I congratulate you on your haul, and wish\r\nyou a merry evening." And the two men parted.\r\n\r\nDorrington had, indeed, a few pounds to draw as the result of his\r\n"fishing" bet with Naylor, but now he resolved to ask for the money\r\nat his own time. This invitation to Telfer took his attention, and\r\nit reminded him oddly of the circumstances detailed in the report of\r\nthe inquest on Lawrence, transcribed at the beginning of this paper.\r\nHe had cut out this report at the time it appeared, because he saw\r\ncertain singularities about the case, and he had filed it, as he had\r\ndone hundreds of other such cuttings. And now certain things led him to\r\nfancy that he might be much interested to observe the proceedings at\r\nNaylor\'s house on the evening after a bad settling-day. He resolved to\r\ngratify himself with a strict professional watch in Gold Street that\r\nevening, on chance of something coming of it. For it was an important\r\nthing in Dorrington\'s rascally trade to get hold of as much of other\r\npeople\'s private business as possible, and to know exactly in what\r\ncupboard to find every man\'s skeleton. For there was no knowing but\r\nit might be turned into money sooner or later. So he found the number\r\nof Naylor\'s house from the handiest directory, and at six o\'clock, a\r\nlittle disguised by a humbler style of dress than usual, he began his\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\nNaylor\'s house was at the corner of a turning, with the flank wall\r\nblank of windows, except for one at the top; and a public-house stood\r\nat the opposite corner. Dorrington, skilled in watching without\r\nattracting attention to himself, now lounged in the public-house bar,\r\nnow stood at the street corner, and now sauntered along the street,\r\na picture of vacancy of mind, and looking, apparently, at everything\r\nin turn, except the house at the corner. The first thing he noted was\r\nthe issuing forth from the area steps of a healthy-looking girl in\r\nmuch gaily be-ribboned finery. Plainly a servant taking an evening\r\nout. This was an odd thing, that a servant should be allowed out on an\r\nevening when a guest was expected to dinner; and the house looked like\r\none where it was more likely that one servant would be kept than two.\r\nDorrington hurried after the girl, and, changing his manner of address\r\nto that of a civil labourer, said--\r\n\r\n"Beg pardon, Miss, but is Mary Walker still in service at your \'ouse?"\r\n\r\n"Mary Walker?" said the girl. "Why, no. I never \'eard the name. And\r\nthere ain\'t nobody in service there but me."\r\n\r\n"Beg pardon--it must be the wrong \'ouse. It\'s my cousin, Miss, that\'s\r\nall."\r\n\r\nDorrington left the girl and returned to the public-house. As he\r\nreached it he perceived a second noticeable thing. Although it was\r\nbroad daylight, there was now a light behind the solitary window at the\r\ntop of the side-wall of Naylor\'s house. Dorrington slipped through the\r\nswing-doors of the public-house and watched through the glass.\r\n\r\nIt was a bare room behind the high window--it might have been a\r\nbathroom--and its interior was made but dimly visible from outside\r\nby the light. A tall, thin woman was setting up an ordinary pair of\r\nhouse-steps in the middle of the room. This done, she turned to the\r\nwindow and pulled down the blind, and as she did so Dorrington noted\r\nher very extreme thinness, both of face and body. When the blind\r\nwas down the light still remained within. Again there seemed some\r\nsignificance in this. It appeared that the thin woman had waited until\r\nher servant had gone before doing whatever she had to do in that room.\r\nPresently the watcher came again into Gold Street, and from there\r\ncaught a passing glimpse of the thin woman as she moved busily about\r\nthe front room over the breakfast parlour.\r\n\r\nClearly, then, the light above had been left for future use. Dorrington\r\nthought for a minute, and then suddenly stopped, with a snap of the\r\nfingers. He saw it all now. Here was something altogether in his way.\r\nHe would take a daring course.\r\n\r\nHe withdrew once more to the public-house, and ordering another drink,\r\ntook up a position in a compartment from which he could command a view\r\nboth of Gold Street and the side turning. The time now, he saw by his\r\nwatch, was ten minutes to seven. He had to wait rather more than a\r\nquarter of an hour before seeing Richard Telfer come walking jauntily\r\ndown Gold Street, mount the steps, and knock at Naylor\'s door. There\r\nwas a momentary glimpse of the thin woman\'s face at the door, and then\r\nTelfer entered.\r\n\r\nIt now began to grow dusk, and in about twenty minutes more Dorrington\r\ntook to the street again. The room over the breakfast-parlour was\r\nclearly the dining-room. It was lighted brightly, and by intent\r\nlistening the watcher could distinguish, now and again, a sudden burst\r\nof laughter from Telfer, followed by the deeper grunts of Naylor\'s\r\nvoice, and once by sharp tones that it seemed natural to suppose were\r\nthe thin woman\'s.\r\n\r\nDorrington waited no longer, but slipped a pair of thick sock-feet over\r\nhis shoes, and, after a quick look along the two streets, to make sure\r\nnobody was near, he descended the area steps. There was no light in the\r\nbreakfast-parlour. With his knife he opened the window-catch, raised\r\nthe sash quietly and stepped over the sill, and stood in the dark room\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nAll was quiet, except for the talking in the room above. He had done\r\nbut what many thieves--"parlour-jumpers"--do every day; but there was\r\nmore ahead. He made his way silently to the basement passage, and\r\npassed into the kitchen. The room was lighted, and cookery utensils\r\nwere scattered about, but nobody was there. He waited till he heard a\r\nrequest in Naylor\'s gruff voice for "another slice" of something, and\r\nnoiselessly mounted the stairs. He noticed that the dining-room door\r\nwas ajar, but passed quickly on to the second flight, and rested on the\r\nlanding above. Mrs. Naylor would probably have to go downstairs once\r\nor twice again, but he did not expect anybody in the upper part of the\r\nhouse just yet. There was a small flight of stairs above the landing\r\nwhereon he stood, leading to the servant\'s bedroom and the bathroom. He\r\ntook a glance at the bathroom with its feeble lamp, its steps, and its\r\nopen ceiling-trap, and returned again to the bedroom landing. There he\r\nstood, waiting watchfully.\r\n\r\nTwice the thin woman emerged from the dining-room, went downstairs and\r\ncame up again, each time with food and plates. Then she went down once\r\nmore, and was longer gone. Meantime Naylor and Telfer were talking and\r\njoking loudly at the table.\r\n\r\nWhen once again Dorrington saw the crown of the thin woman\'s head\r\nrising over the bottom stair, he perceived that she bore a tray set\r\nwith cups already filled with coffee. These she carried into the\r\ndining-room, whence presently came the sound of striking matches. After\r\nthis the conversation seemed to flag, and Telfer\'s part in it grew less\r\nand less, till it ceased altogether, and the house was silent, except\r\nfor a sound of heavy breathing. Soon this became almost a snore, and\r\nthen there was a sudden noisy tumble, as of a drunken man; but still\r\nthe snoring went on, and the Naylors were talking in whispers.\r\n\r\nThere was a shuffling and heaving sound, and a chair was knocked over.\r\nThen at the dining-room door appeared Naylor, walking backward, and\r\ncarrying the inert form of Telfer by the shoulders, while the thin\r\nwoman followed, supporting the feet. Dorrington retreated up the small\r\nstair-flight, cocking a pocket revolver as he went.\r\n\r\nUp the stairs they came, Naylor puffing and grunting with the exertion,\r\nand Telfer still snoring soundly on, till at last, having mounted the\r\ntop flight, they came in at the bathroom door, where Dorrington stood\r\nto receive them, smiling and bowing pleasantly, with his hat in one\r\nhand and his revolver in the other.\r\n\r\nThe woman, from her position, saw him first, and dropped Telfer\'s legs\r\nwith a scream. Naylor turned his head and then also dropped his end.\r\nThe drugged man fell in a heap, snoring still.\r\n\r\nNaylor, astounded and choking, made as if to rush at the interloper,\r\nbut Dorrington thrust the revolver into his face, and exclaimed,\r\nstill smiling courteously, "Mind, mind! It\'s a dangerous thing, is a\r\nrevolver, and apt to go off if you run against it!"\r\n\r\nHe stood thus for a second, and then stepped forward and took the\r\nwoman--who seemed like to swoon--by the arm, and pulled her into the\r\nroom. "Come, Mrs. Naylor," he said, "you\'re not one of the fainting\r\nsort, and I think I\'d better keep two such clever people as you under\r\nmy eye, or one of you may get into mischief. Come now, Naylor, we\'ll\r\ntalk business."\r\n\r\nNaylor, now white as a ghost, sat on the edge of the bath, and stared\r\nat Dorrington as though in a fascination of terror. His hands rested on\r\nthe bath at each side, and an odd sound of gurgling came from his thick\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\n"We will talk business," Dorrington resumed. "Come, you\'ve met me\r\nbefore now, you know--at Redbury. You can\'t have forgotten Janissary,\r\nand the walking exercise and the handful of malt. I\'m afraid you\'re a\r\nclumsy sort of rascal, Naylor, though you do your best. I\'m a rascal\r\nmyself (though I don\'t often confess it), and I assure you that your\r\nconceptions are crude as yet. Still, that isn\'t a bad notion in its\r\nway, that of drugging a man and drowning him in your cistern up there\r\nin the roof, when you prefer not to pay him his winnings. It has the\r\nvery considerable merit that, after the body has been fished out of any\r\nriver you may choose to fling it into, the stupid coroner\'s jury will\r\nnever suspect that it was drowned in any other water but that. Just as\r\nhappened in the Lawrence case, for instance. You remember that, eh? So\r\ndo I, very well, and it was because I remembered that that I paid you\r\nthis visit to-night. But you do the thing much too clumsily, really.\r\nWhen I saw a light up here in broad daylight I knew at once it must be\r\nleft for some purpose to be executed later in the evening; and when\r\nI saw the steps carefully placed at the same time, after the servant\r\nhad been sent out, why the thing was plain, remembering, as I did, the\r\ncurious coincidence that Mr. Lawrence was drowned the very evening he\r\nhad been here to take away his winnings. The steps _must_ be intended\r\nto give access to the roof, where there was probably a tank to feed\r\nthe bath, and what more secret place to drown a man than there? And\r\nwhat easier place, so long as the man was well drugged, and there was a\r\nstrong lid to the tank? As I say, Naylor, your notion was meritorious,\r\nbut your execution was wretched--perhaps because you had no notion that\r\nI was watching you."\r\n\r\nHe paused, and then went on. "Come," he said, "collect your scattered\r\nfaculties, both of you. I shan\'t hand you over to the police for this\r\nlittle invention of yours; it\'s too useful an invention to give away\r\nto the police. I shan\'t hand you over, that is to say, as long as you\r\ndo as I tell you. If you get mutinous, you shall hang, both of you,\r\nfor the Lawrence business. I may as well tell you that I\'m a bit of a\r\nscoundrel myself, by way of profession. I don\'t boast about it, but\r\nit\'s well to be frank in making arrangements of this sort. I\'m going to\r\ntake you into my service. I employ a few agents, and you and your tank\r\nmay come in very handy from time to time. But we must set it up, with\r\na few improvements, in another house--a house which hasn\'t quite such\r\nan awkward window. And we mustn\'t execute our little suppressions so\r\nregularly on settling-day; it looks suspicious. So as soon as you can\r\nget your faculties together we\'ll talk over this thing."\r\n\r\nThe man and the woman had exchanged glances during this speech, and now\r\nNaylor asked, huskily, jerking his thumb toward the man on the floor,\r\n"An\'--an\' what about \'im?"\r\n\r\n"What about him? Why, get rid of him as soon as you like. Not that\r\nway, though." (He pointed toward the ceiling trap.) "It doesn\'t pay\r\n_me_, and I\'m master now. Besides, what will people say when you tell\r\nthe same tale at his inquest that you told at Lawrence\'s? No, my\r\nfriend, bookmaking and murder don\'t assort together, profitable as the\r\ncombination may seem. Settling-days are too regular. And I\'m not going\r\nto be your accomplice, mind. You are going to be mine. Do what you\r\nplease with Telfer. Leave him on somebody\'s doorstep if you like."\r\n\r\n"But I owe him fifteen hundred, and I ain\'t got more than half of it!\r\nI\'ll be ruined!"\r\n\r\n"Very likely," Dorrington returned placidly. "Be ruined as soon as\r\npossible, then, and devote all your time to my business. You\'re not\r\nto ornament the ring any longer, remember--you\'re to assist a private\r\ninquiry agent, you and your wife and your charming tank. Repudiate the\r\ndebt if you like--it\'s a mere gaming transaction, and there is no legal\r\nclaim--or leave him in the street and tell him he\'s been robbed. Please\r\nyourself as to this little roguery--you may as well, for it\'s the\r\nlast you will do on your own account. For the future your respectable\r\ntalents will be devoted to the service of Dorrington & Hicks, private\r\ninquiry agents; and if you don\'t give satisfaction, that eminent firm\r\nwill hang you, with the assistance of the judge at the Old Bailey. So\r\nsettle your business yourselves, and quickly, for I\'ve a good many\r\nthings to arrange with you."\r\n\r\nAnd, Dorrington watching them continually, they took Telfer out by the\r\nside gate in the garden wall and left him in a dark corner.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus I learnt the history of the horrible tank that had so nearly ended\r\nmy own life, as I have already related. Clearly the Naylors had changed\r\ntheir name to Crofting on taking compulsory service with Dorrington,\r\nand Mrs. Naylor was the repulsively thin woman who had drugged me with\r\nher coffee in the house at Highgate. The events I have just recorded\r\ntook place about three years before I came to England. In the meantime\r\nhow many people, whose deaths might be turned to profit, had fallen\r\nvictims to the murderous cunning of Dorrington and his tools?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE CASE OF THE "MIRROR OF\r\n  PORTUGAL"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe Case of the "Mirror of Portugal"\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nWhether or not this case has an historical interest is a matter of\r\nconjecture. If it has none, then the title I have given it is a\r\nmisnomer. But I think the conjecture that some historical interest\r\nattaches to it is by no means an empty one, and all that can be urged\r\nagainst it is the common though not always declared error that romance\r\nexpired fifty years at least ago, and history with it. This makes it\r\nseem improbable that the answer to an unsolved riddle of a century\r\nsince should be found to-day in an inquiry agent\'s dingy office in\r\nBedford Street, Covent Garden. Whether or not it has so been found\r\nthe reader may judge for himself, though the evidence stops far short\r\nof actual proof of the identity of the "Mirror of Portugal" with the\r\nstone wherewith this case was concerned.\r\n\r\nBut first, as to the "Mirror of Portugal." This was a diamond of much\r\nand ancient fame. It was of Indian origin, and it had lain in the\r\npossession of the royal family of Portugal in the time of Portugal\'s\r\nancient splendour. But three hundred years ago, after the extinction\r\nof the early line of succession, the diamond, with other jewels, fell\r\ninto the possession of Don Antonio, one of the half-dozen pretenders\r\nwho were then scrambling for the throne. Don Antonio, badly in want\r\nof money, deposited the stone in pledge with Queen Elizabeth of\r\nEngland, and never redeemed it. Thus it took its place as one of the\r\nEnglish Crown jewels, and so remained till the overthrow and death\r\nof Charles the First. Queen Henrietta then carried it with her to\r\nFrance, and there, to obtain money to satisfy her creditors, she sold\r\nit to the great Cardinal Mazarin. He bequeathed it, at his death, to\r\nthe French Crown, and among the Crown jewels of France it once more\r\nfound a temporary abiding place. But once more it brought disaster\r\nwith it in the shape of a revolution, and again a king lost his head\r\nat the executioner\'s hands. And in the riot and confusion of the\r\ngreat Revolution of 1792 the "Mirror of Portugal," with other jewels,\r\nvanished utterly. Where it went to, and who took it, nobody ever knew.\r\nThe "Mirror of Portugal" disappeared as suddenly and effectually as\r\nthough fused to vapour by electric combustion.\r\n\r\nSo much for the famous "Mirror." Whether or not its history is germane\r\nto the narrative which follows, probably nobody will ever certainly\r\nknow. But that Dorrington considered that it was, his notes on the case\r\nabundantly testify.\r\n\r\nFor some days before Dorrington\'s attention was in any way given\r\nto this matter, a poorly-dressed and not altogether prepossessing\r\nFrenchman had been haunting the staircase and tapping at the office\r\ndoor, unsuccessfully attempting an interview with Dorrington, who\r\nhappened to be out, or busy, whenever he called. The man never asked\r\nfor Hicks, Dorrington\'s partner; but this was very natural. In the\r\nfirst place, it was always Dorrington who met all strangers and\r\nconducted all negotiations, and in the second, Dorrington had just\r\nlately, in a case regarding a secret society in Soho, made his name\r\nmuch known and respected, not to say feared, in the foreign colony of\r\nthat quarter; wherefore it was likely that a man who bore evidence of\r\nresidence in that neighbourhood should come with the name of Dorrington\r\non his tongue.\r\n\r\nThe weather was cold, but the man\'s clothes were thin and threadbare,\r\nand he had no overcoat. His face was of a broad, low type, coarse in\r\nfeature and small in forehead, and he wore the baggy black linen peaked\r\ncap familiar on the heads of men of his class in parts of Paris. He had\r\ncalled unsuccessfully, as I have said, sometimes once, sometimes more\r\nfrequently, on each of three or four days before he succeeded in seeing\r\nDorrington. At last, however, he intercepted him on the stairs, as\r\nDorrington arrived at about eleven in the morning.\r\n\r\n"Pardon, m\'sieu," he said, laying his finger on Dorrington\'s arm, "it\r\nis M. Dorrington--not?"\r\n\r\n"Well--suppose it is, what then?" Dorrington never admitted his\r\nidentity to a stranger without first seeing good cause.\r\n\r\n"I \'ave beesness--very great beesness; beesness of a large profit for\r\nyou if you please to take it. Where shall I tell it?"\r\n\r\n"Come in here," Dorrington replied, leading the way to his private\r\nroom. The man did not look like a wealthy client, but that signified\r\nnothing. Dorrington had made profitable strokes after introductions\r\neven less promising.\r\n\r\nThe man followed Dorrington, pulled off his cap, and sat in the chair\r\nDorrington pointed at.\r\n\r\n"In the first place," said Dorrington, "what\'s your name?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, yas--but before--all that I tell is for ourselves alone, is it\r\nnot? It is all in confidence, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, of course," Dorrington answered, with virtuous impatience.\r\n"Whatever is said in this room is regarded as strictly confidential.\r\nWhat\'s your name?"\r\n\r\n"Jacques Bouvier."\r\n\r\n"Living at----?"\r\n\r\n"Little Norham Street, Soho."\r\n\r\n"And now the business you speak of."\r\n\r\n"The beesness is this. My cousin, L\xc3\xa9on Bouvier--he is _coquin_--a\r\nrrrascal!"\r\n\r\n"Very likely."\r\n\r\n"He has a great jewel--it is, I have no doubt, a diamond--of a great\r\nvalue. It is not his! There is no right of him to it! It should be\r\nmine. If you get it for me one-quarter of it in money shall be yours!\r\nAnd it is of a great value."\r\n\r\n"Where does your cousin live? What is he?"\r\n\r\n"Beck Street, Soho. He has a shop--a caf\xc3\xa9--Caf\xc3\xa9 des Bons Camarades. And\r\nhe give me not a crrrust--if I starve!"\r\n\r\nIt scarcely seemed likely that the keeper of a little foreign caf\xc3\xa9 in\r\na back street of Soho would be possessed of a jewel a quarter of whose\r\nvalue would be prize enough to tempt Dorrington to take a new case up.\r\nBut Dorrington bore with the man a little longer. "What is this jewel\r\nyou talk of?" he asked. "And if you don\'t know enough about it to be\r\nquite sure whether it is a diamond or not, what _do_ you know?"\r\n\r\n"Listen! The stone I have never seen; but that it is a diamond makes\r\nprobable. What else so much value? And it is much value that gives my\r\ncousin so great care and trouble--_cochon!_ Listen! I relate to you.\r\nMy father--he was charcoal-burner at Bonneuil, department of Seine.\r\nMy uncle--the father of my cousin--also was charcoal-burner. The\r\ngrandfather--charcoal-burner also; and his father and his grandfather\r\nbefore him--all burners of charcoal, at Bonneuil. Now perceive. The\r\nfather of my grandfather was of the great Revolution--a young man,\r\ngreat among those who stormed the Bastille, the Tuileries, the H\xc3\xb4tel\r\nde Ville, brave, and a leader. Now, when palaces were burnt and\r\nheads were falling there was naturally much confusion. Things were\r\nlost--things of large value. What more natural? While so many were\r\nlosing the head from the shoulders, it was not strange that some should\r\nlose jewels from the neck. And when these things were lost, who might\r\nhave a greater right to keep them than the young men of the Revolution,\r\nthe brave, and the leaders, they who did the work?"\r\n\r\n"If you mean that your respectable great-grandfather stole something,\r\nyou needn\'t explain it any more," Dorrington said. "I quite understand."\r\n\r\n"I do not say stole; when there is a great revolution a thing is\r\nanybody\'s. But it would not be convenient to tell of it at the time,\r\nfor the new Government might believe everything to be its own. These\r\nthings I do not know, you will understand--I suggest an explanation,\r\nthat is all. After the great Revolution, my great-grandfather lives\r\nalone and quiet, and burns the charcoal as before. Why? The jewel is\r\ntoo great to sell so soon. So he gives it to his son and dies. He also,\r\nmy grandfather, still burns the charcoal. Again, why? Because, as I\r\nbelieve, he is too poor, too common a man to go about openly to sell\r\nso great a stone. More, he loves the stone, for with that he is always\r\nrich; and so he burns his charcoal and lives contented as his father\r\nhad done, and he is rich, and nobody knows it. What then? He has two\r\nsons. When he dies, which son does he leave the stone to? Each one says\r\nit is for himself--that is natural. I say it was for my father. But\r\nhowever that may make itself, my father dies suddenly. He falls in a\r\npit--by accident, says his brother; not by accident, says my mother;\r\nand soon after, she dies too. By accident too, perhaps you ask? Oh\r\nyes, by accident too, no doubt." The man laughed disagreeably. "So I\r\nam left alone, a little boy, to burn charcoal. When I am a bigger boy\r\nthere comes the great war, and the Prussians besiege Paris. My uncle,\r\nhe, burning charcoal no more, goes at night, and takes things from the\r\ndead Prussians. Perhaps they are not always quite dead when he finds\r\nthem--perhaps he makes them so. Be that as it will, the Prussians take\r\nhim one dark night; and they stand him against a garden wall, and pif!\r\npaf! they shoot him. That is all of my uncle; but he dies a rich man,\r\nand nobody knows. What does his wife do? She has the jewel, and she\r\nhas a little money that has been got from the dead Prussians. So when\r\nthe war is over, she comes to London with my cousin, the bad L\xc3\xa9on,\r\nand she has the caf\xc3\xa9--Caf\xc3\xa9 des Bons Camarades. And L\xc3\xa9on grows up, and\r\nhis mother dies, and he has the caf\xc3\xa9, and with the jewel is a rich\r\nman--nobody knowing; nobody but me. But, figure to yourself; shall I\r\nburn charcoal and starve at Bonneuil with a rich cousin in London--rich\r\nwith a diamond that should be mine? Not so. I come over, and L\xc3\xa9on, at\r\nfirst he lets me wait at the caf\xc3\xa9. But I do not want that--there is the\r\nstone, and I can never see it, never find it. So one day L\xc3\xa9on finds me\r\nlooking in a box, and--chut! out I go. I tell L\xc3\xa9on that I will share\r\nthe jewel with him or I will tell the police. He laughs at me--there is\r\nno jewel, he says--I am mad. I do not tell the police, for that is to\r\nlose it altogether. But I come here and I offer you one quarter of the\r\ndiamond if you shall get it."\r\n\r\n"Steal it for you, eh?"\r\n\r\nJacques Bouvier shrugged his shoulders. "The word is as you please,"\r\nhe said. "The jewel is not his. And if there is delay it will be gone.\r\nAlready he goes each day to Hatton Garden, leaving his wife to keep the\r\nCaf\xc3\xa9 des Bons Camarades. Perhaps he is selling the jewel to-day! Who\r\ncan tell? So that it will be well that you begin at once."\r\n\r\n"Very well. My fee in advance will be twenty guineas."\r\n\r\n"What? _Dieu!_--I have no money, I tell you! Get the diamond, and there\r\nis one quarter--twenty-five per cent.--for you!"\r\n\r\n"But what guarantee do you give that this story of yours isn\'t all\r\na hoax? Can you expect me to take everything on trust, and work for\r\nnothing?"\r\n\r\nThe man rose and waved his arms excitedly. "It is true, I say!" he\r\nexclaimed. "It is a fortune! There is much for you, and it will pay! I\r\nhave no money, or you should have some. What can I do? You will lose\r\nthe chance if you are foolish!"\r\n\r\n"It rather seems to me, my friend, that I shall be foolish to give\r\nvaluable time to gratifying your cock-and-bull fancies. See here now.\r\nI\'m a man of business, and my time is fully occupied. You come here\r\nand waste half an hour or more of it with a long rigmarole about some\r\nvaluable article that you say yourself you have never seen, and you\r\ndon\'t even know whether it is a diamond or not. You wander at large\r\nover family traditions which you may believe yourself or may not.\r\nYou have no money, and you offer no fee as a guarantee of your _bon\xc3\xa2\r\nfides_, and the sum of the thing is that you ask me to go and commit\r\na theft--to purloin an article you can\'t even describe, and then to\r\ngive you three-quarters of the proceeds. No, my man, you have made a\r\nmistake. You must go away from here at once, and if I find you hanging\r\nabout my door again I shall have you taken away very summarily. Do you\r\nunderstand? Now go away."\r\n\r\n"_Mon Dieu!_ But----"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no more time to waste," Dorrington answered, opening the door and\r\npointing to the stairs. "If you stay here any longer you\'ll get into\r\ntrouble."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "SIR YOU ARE A VER\' BIG FOOL--A FOOL!"]\r\n\r\nJacques Bouvier walked out, muttering and agitating his hands. At\r\nthe top stair he turned and, almost too angry for words, burst out,\r\n"Sir--you are a ver\' big fool--a fool!" But Dorrington slammed the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nHe determined, however, if he could find a little time, to learn a\r\nlittle more of L\xc3\xa9on Bouvier--perhaps to put a man to watch at the\r\nCaf\xc3\xa9 des Bons Camarades. That the keeper of this place in Soho should\r\ngo regularly to Hatton Garden, the diamond market, was curious, and\r\nDorrington had met and analysed too many extraordinary romances to put\r\naside unexamined Jacques Bouvier\'s seemingly improbable story. But,\r\nhaving heard all the man had to say, it had clearly been his policy\r\nto get rid of him in the way he had done. Dorrington was quite ready\r\nto steal a diamond, or anything else of value, if it could be done\r\nquite safely, but he was no such fool as to give three-quarters of his\r\nplunder--or any of it--to somebody else. So that the politic plan was\r\nto send Jacques Bouvier away with the impression that his story was\r\naltogether pooh-poohed and was to be forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nDorrington left his office late that day, and the evening being clear,\r\nthough dark, he walked toward Conduit Street by way of Soho; he thought\r\nto take a glance at the Caf\xc3\xa9 des Bons Camarades on his way, without\r\nbeing observed, should Jacques Bouvier be in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nBeck Street, Soho, was a short and narrow street lying east and\r\nwest, and joining two of the larger streets that stretch north and\r\nsouth across the district. It was even a trifle dirtier than these\r\nby-streets in that quarter are wont to be. The Caf\xc3\xa9 des Bons Camarades\r\nwas a little green-painted shop the window whereof was backed by\r\nmuslin curtains, while upon the window itself appeared in florid\r\npainted letters the words "Cuisine Fran\xc3\xa7aise." It was the only shop\r\nin the street, with the exception of a small coal and firewood shed\r\nat one end, the other buildings consisting of the side wall of a\r\nfactory, now closed for the night, and a few tenement houses. An alley\r\nentrance--apparently the gate of a stable-yard--stood next the caf\xc3\xa9.\r\nAs Dorrington walked by the steamy window, he was startled to hear\r\nhis own name and some part of his office address spoken in excited\r\ntones somewhere in this dark alley entrance; and suddenly a man rather\r\nwell dressed, and cramming a damaged tall hat on his head as he went,\r\ndarted from the entrance and ran in the direction from which Dorrington\r\nhad come. A stoutly built Frenchwoman, carrying on her face every\r\nindication of extreme excitement, watched him from the gateway, and\r\nDorrington made no doubt that it was in her voice that he had heard\r\nhis name mentioned. He walked briskly to the end of the short street,\r\nturned at the end, and hurried round the block of houses, in hope\r\nto catch another sight of the man. Presently he saw him, running,\r\nin Old Compton Street, and making in the direction of Charing Cross\r\nRoad. Dorrington mended his pace, and followed. The man emerged where\r\nShaftesbury Avenue meets Charing Cross Road, and, as he crossed,\r\nhesitated once or twice, as though he thought of hailing a cab, but\r\ndecided rather to trust his own legs. He hastened through the byways\r\nto St. Martin\'s Lane, and Dorrington now perceived that one side and\r\nhalf the back of his coat was dripping with wet mud. Also it was plain,\r\nas Dorrington had suspected, that his destination was Dorrington\'s own\r\noffice in Bedford Street. So the follower broke into a trot, and at\r\nlast came upon the muddy man wrenching at the bell and pounding at the\r\nclosed door of the house in Bedford Street, just as the housekeeper\r\nbegan to turn the lock.\r\n\r\n"M\'sieu Dorrington--M\'sieu Dorrington!" the man exclaimed, excitedly,\r\nas the door was opened.\r\n\r\n"\'E\'s gawn \'ome long ago," the caretaker growled; "you might \'a known\r\nthat. Oh, \'ere \'e is though--good evenin\', sir."\r\n\r\n"I am Mr. Dorrington," the inquiry agent said politely. "Can I do\r\nanything for you?"\r\n\r\n"Ah yes--it is important--at once! I am robbed!"\r\n\r\n"Just step upstairs, then, and tell me about it."\r\n\r\nDorrington had but begun to light the gas in his office when his\r\nvisitor broke out, "I am robbed, M\'sieu Dorrington, robbed by my\r\ncousin--_coquin!_ Rrrobbed of everything! Rrrobbed I tell you!"\r\nHe seemed astonished to find the other so little excited by the\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\n"Let me take your coat," Dorrington said, calmly. "You\'ve had a downer\r\nin the mud, I see. Why, what\'s this?" he smelt the collar as he went\r\ntoward a hat-peg. "Chloroform!"\r\n\r\n"Ah yes--it is that rrrascal Jacques! I will tell you. This evening I\r\ngo into the gateway next my house--Caf\xc3\xa9 des Bons Camarades--to enter\r\nby the side-door, and--paf!--a shawl is fling across my face from\r\nbehind--it is pull tight--there is a knee in my back--I can catch\r\nnothing with my hand--it smell all hot in my throat--I choke and I fall\r\nover--there is no more. I wake up and I see my wife, and she take me\r\ninto the house. I am all muddy and tired, but I feel--and I have lost\r\nmy property--it is a diamond--and my cousin Jacques, he has done it!"\r\n\r\n"Are you sure of that?"\r\n\r\n"Sure? Oh yes--it is certain, I tell you--certain!"\r\n\r\n"Then why not inform the police?"\r\n\r\nThe visitor was clearly taken aback by this question. He faltered,\r\nand looked searchingly in Dorrington\'s face. "That is not always the\r\nconvenient way," he said. "I would rather that you do it. It is the\r\ndiamond that I want--not to punish my cousin--thief that he is!"\r\n\r\nDorrington mended a quill with ostentatious care, saying encouragingly\r\nas he did so, "I can quite understand that you may not wish to\r\nprosecute your cousin--only to recover the diamond you speak of. Also\r\nI can quite understand that there may be reasons--family reasons\r\nperhaps, perhaps others--which may render it inadvisable to make even\r\nthe existence of the jewel known more than absolutely necessary. For\r\ninstance, there may be other claimants, Monsieur L\xc3\xa9on Bouvier."\r\n\r\nThe visitor started. "You know my name then?" he asked. "How is that?"\r\n\r\nDorrington smiled the smile of a sphinx. "M. Bouvier," he said, "it is\r\nmy trade to know everything--everything." He put the pen down and gazed\r\nwhimsically at the other. "My agents are everywhere. You talk of the\r\nsecret agent of the Russian police--they are nothing. It is my trade\r\nto know all things. For instance"--Dorrington unlocked a drawer and\r\nproduced a book (it was but an office diary), and, turning its pages,\r\nwent on. "Let me see--B. It is my trade, for instance, to know about\r\nthe Caf\xc3\xa9 des Bons Camarades, established by the late Madame Bouvier,\r\nnow unhappily deceased. It is my trade to know of Madame Bouvier at\r\nBonneuil, where the charcoal was burnt, and where Madame Bouvier was\r\nunfortunately left a widow at the time of the siege of Paris, because\r\nof some lamentable misunderstanding of her husband\'s with a file\r\nof Prussian soldiers by an orchard wall. It is my trade, moreover,\r\nto know something of the sad death of that husband\'s brother--in\r\na pit--and of the later death of his widow. Oh yes. More" (turning\r\na page attentively, as though following detailed notes), "it is my\r\ntrade to know of a little quarrel between those brothers--it might\r\neven have been about a diamond, just such a diamond as you have come\r\nabout to-night--and of jewels missed from the Tuileries in the great\r\nRevolution a hundred years ago." He shut the book with a bang and\r\nreturned it to its place. "And there are other things--too many to talk\r\nabout," he said, crossing his legs and smiling calmly at the Frenchman.\r\n\r\nDuring this long pretence at reading, Bouvier had slid farther and\r\nfarther forward on his chair, till he sat on the edge, his eyes staring\r\nwide, and his chin dropped. He had been pale when he arrived, but now\r\nhe was of a leaden gray. He said not a word.\r\n\r\nDorrington laughed lightly. "Come," he said, "I see you are astonished.\r\nVery likely. Very few of the people and families whose _dossiers_ we\r\nhave here" (he waved his hand generally about the room) "are aware of\r\nwhat we know. But we don\'t make a song of it, I assure you, unless\r\nit is for the benefit of clients. A client\'s affairs are sacred, of\r\ncourse, and our resources are at his disposal. Do I understand that\r\nyou become a client?"\r\n\r\nBouvier sat a little farther back on his chair and closed his mouth.\r\n"A--a--yes," he answered at length, with an effort, moistening his lips\r\nas he spoke. "That is why I come."\r\n\r\n"Ah, now we shall understand each other," Dorrington replied genially,\r\nopening an ink-pot and clearing his blotting-pad. "We\'re not connected\r\nwith the police here, or anything of that sort, and except so far as\r\nwe can help them we leave our client\'s affairs alone. You wish to be\r\na client, and you wish me to recover your lost diamond. Very well,\r\nthat is business. The first thing is the usual fee in advance--twenty\r\nguineas. Will you write a cheque?"\r\n\r\nBouvier had recovered some of his self-possession, and he hesitated.\r\n"It is a large fee," he said.\r\n\r\n"Large? Nonsense! It is the sort of fee that might easily be swallowed\r\nup in half a day\'s expenses. And besides--a rich diamond merchant like\r\nyourself!"\r\n\r\nBouvier looked up quickly. "Diamond merchant?" he said. "I do not\r\nunderstand. I have lost my diamond--there was but one."\r\n\r\n"And yet you go to Hatton Garden every day."\r\n\r\n"What!" cried Bouvier, letting his hand fall from the table, "you know\r\nthat too?"\r\n\r\n"Of course," Dorrington laughed, easily; "it is my trade, I tell you.\r\nBut write the cheque."\r\n\r\nBouvier produced a crumpled and dirty cheque-book and complied, with\r\nmany pauses, looking up dazedly from time to time into Dorrington\'s\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Dorrington, "tell me where you kept your diamond, and all\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\n"It was in an old little wooden box--so." Bouvier, not yet quite master\r\nof himself, sketched an oblong of something less than three inches\r\nlong by two broad. "The box was old and black--my grandfather may have\r\nmade it, or his father. The lid fitted very tight, and the inside was\r\npacked with fine charcoal powder with the diamond resting in it. The\r\ndiamond--oh, it was great; like that--so." He made another sketch,\r\nroughly square, an inch and a quarter across. "But it looked even much\r\ngreater still, so bright, so wonderful! It is easy to understand that\r\nmy grandfather did not sell it--beside the danger. It is so beautiful\r\na thing, and it is such great riches--all in one little box. Why\r\nshould not a poor charcoal-burner be rich in secret, and look at his\r\ndiamond, and get all the few things he wants by burning his charcoal?\r\nAnd there was the danger. But that is long ago. I am a man of beesness,\r\nand I desired to sell it and be rich. And that Jacques--he has stolen\r\nit!"\r\n\r\n"Let us keep to the point. The diamond was in a box. Well, where was\r\nthe box?"\r\n\r\n"On the outside of the box there were notches--so, and so. Round the\r\nbox at each place there was a tight, strong, silk cord--that is two\r\ncords. The cords were round my neck, under my shirt, so. And the box\r\nwas under my arm--just as a boy carries his satchel, but high up--in\r\nthe armpit, where I could feel it at all times. To-night, when I come\r\nto myself, my collar was broken at the stud--see--the cords were\r\ncut--and all was gone!"\r\n\r\n"You say your cousin Jacques has done this. How do you know?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! But who else? Who else could know? And he has always tried to\r\nsteal it. At first, I let him wait at the Caf\xc3\xa9 des Bons Camarades. What\r\ndoes he do? He prys about my house, and opens drawers; and I catch him\r\nat last looking in a box, and I turn him out. And he calls me a thief!\r\n_Sacr\xc3\xa9!_ He goes--I have no more of him; and so--he does this!"\r\n\r\n"Very well. Write down his name and address on this piece of paper, and\r\nyour own." Bouvier did so. "And now tell me what you have been doing at\r\nHatton Garden."\r\n\r\n"Well, it was a very great diamond--I could not go to the first man and\r\nshow it to sell. I must make myself known."\r\n\r\n"It never struck you to get the stone cut in two, did it?"\r\n\r\n"Eh? What?--_Nom de chien!_ No!" He struck his knee with his hand.\r\n"Fool! Why did I not think of that? But still"--he grew more\r\nthoughtful--"I should have to show it to get it cut, and I did not know\r\nwhere to go. And the value would have been less."\r\n\r\n"Just so--but it\'s the regular thing to do, I may tell you, in cases\r\nlike this. But go on. About Hatton Garden, you know."\r\n\r\n"I thought that I must make myself known among the merchants of\r\ndiamonds, and then, perhaps, I should learn the ways, and one day be\r\nable to sell. As it was, I knew nothing--nothing at all. I waited, and\r\nI saved money in the caf\xc3\xa9. Then, when I could do it, I dressed well\r\nand went and bought some diamonds of a dealer--very little diamonds,\r\na little trayful for twenty pounds, and I try to sell them again. But\r\nI have paid too much--I can only sell for fifteen pounds. Then I buy\r\nmore, and sell them for what I give. Then I take an office in Hatton\r\nGarden--that is, I share a room with a dealer, and there is a partition\r\nbetween our desks. My wife attends the caf\xc3\xa9, I go to Hatton Garden\r\nto buy and sell. It loses me money, but I must lose till I can sell\r\nthe great diamond. I get to know the dealers more and more, and then\r\nto-night, as I go home----" he finished with an expressive shrug and a\r\nwave of the hand.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I think I see," Dorrington said. "As to the diamond again.\r\nIt doesn\'t happen to be a _blue_ diamond, does it?"\r\n\r\n"No--pure white; perfect."\r\n\r\nDorrington had asked because two especially famous diamonds disappeared\r\nfrom among the French Crown jewels at the time of the great Revolution.\r\nOne blue, the greatest coloured diamond ever known, and the other\r\nthe "Mirror of Portugal." Bouvier\'s reply made it plain that it was\r\ncertainly not the first which he had just lost.\r\n\r\n"Come," Dorrington said, "I will call and inspect the scene of your\r\ndisaster. I haven\'t dined yet, and it must be well past nine o\'clock\r\nnow."\r\n\r\nThey returned to Beck Street. There were gates at the dark entry by the\r\nside of the Caf\xc3\xa9 des Bons Camarades, but they were never shut, Bouvier\r\nexplained. Dorrington had them shut now, however, and a lantern was\r\nproduced. The paving was of rough cobble stones, deep in mud.\r\n\r\n"Do many people come down here in the course of an evening?" Dorrington\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"Never anybody but myself."\r\n\r\n"Very well. Stand away at your side door."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "DORRINGTON, WITH THE LANTERN, EXPLORED THE MUDDY COBBLE\r\nSTONES."]\r\n\r\nBouvier and his wife stood huddled and staring on the threshold of\r\nthe side door, while Dorrington, with the lantern, explored the muddy\r\ncobble stones. The pieces of a broken bottle lay in a little heap,\r\nand a cork lay a yard away from them. Dorrington smelt the cork, and\r\nthen collected together the broken glass (there were but four or five\r\npieces) from the little heap. Another piece of glass lay by itself a\r\nlittle way off, and this also Dorrington took up, scrutinising it\r\nnarrowly. Then he traversed the whole passage carefully, stepping from\r\nbare stone to bare stone, and skimming the ground with the lantern. The\r\nmud lay confused and trackless in most places, though the place where\r\nBouvier had been lying was indicated by an appearance of sweeping,\r\ncaused, no doubt, by his wife dragging him to his feet. Only one other\r\nthing beside the glass and cork did Dorrington carry away as evidence,\r\nand that the Bouviers knew nothing of; for it was the remembrance of\r\nthe mark of a sharp, small boot-heel in more than one patch of mud\r\nbetween the stones.\r\n\r\n"Will you object, Madame Bouvier," he asked, as he handed back the\r\nlantern, "to show me the shoes you wore when you found your husband\r\nlying out here?"\r\n\r\nMadame Bouvier had no objection at all. They were what she was then\r\nwearing, and had worn all day. She lifted her foot and exhibited one.\r\nThere was no need for a second glance. It was a loose easy cashmere\r\nboot, with spring sides and heels cut down flat for indoor comfort.\r\n\r\n"And this was at what time?"\r\n\r\nIt was between seven and eight o\'clock, both agreed, though they\r\ndiffered a little as to the exact time. Bouvier had recovered when his\r\nwife raised him, had entered the house with her, at once discovered\r\nhis loss, and immediately, on his wife\'s advice, set out to find\r\nDorrington, whose name the woman had heard spoken of frequently among\r\nthe visitors to the caf\xc3\xa9 in connection with the affair of the secret\r\nsociety already alluded to. He had felt certain that Dorrington would\r\nnot be at his office, but trusted to be directed where to find him.\r\n\r\n"Now," Dorrington asked of Bouvier (the woman had been called away),\r\n"tell me some more about your cousin. Where does he live?"\r\n\r\n"In Little Norham Street; the third house from this end on the right\r\nand the back room at the top. That is unless he has moved just lately."\r\n\r\n"Has he been ill recently?"\r\n\r\n"Ill?" Bouvier considered. "Not that I can say--no. I have never heard\r\nof Jacques being ill." It seemed to strike him as an incongruous and\r\nnew idea. "Nothing has made him ill all his life--he is too good in\r\nconstitution, I think."\r\n\r\n"Does he wear spectacles?"\r\n\r\n"Spectacles? _Mais non!_ Never! Why should he wear spectacles? His eyes\r\nare good as mine."\r\n\r\n"Very well. Now attend. To-morrow you must not go to Hatton Garden--I\r\nwill go for you. If you see your cousin Jacques you must say nothing,\r\ntake no notice; let everything proceed as though nothing had happened;\r\nleave all to me. Give me your address at Hatton Garden."\r\n\r\n"But what is it you must do there?"\r\n\r\n"That is my business. I do my business in my own way. Still I will give\r\nyou a hint. Where is it that diamonds are sold? In Hatton Garden, as\r\nyou so well know--as I expect your cousin knows if he has been watching\r\nyou. Then where will your cousin go to sell it? Hatton Garden, of\r\ncourse. Never mind what I shall do there to intercept it. I am to be\r\nyour new partner, you understand, bringing money into the business. You\r\nmust be ill and stay at home till you hear from me. Go now and write me\r\na letter of introduction to the man who shares the office with you. Or\r\nI will write it if you like, and you shall sign it. What sort of a man\r\nis he?"\r\n\r\n"Very quiet--a tall man, perhaps English, but perhaps not."\r\n\r\n"Ever buy or sell diamonds with him?"\r\n\r\n"Once only. It was the first time. That is how I learned of the\r\nhalf-office to let."\r\n\r\nThe letter was written, and Dorrington stuffed it carelessly into his\r\npocket. "Mr. Hamer is the name, is it?" he said. "I fancy I have met\r\nhim somewhere. He is short-sighted, isn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, he is short-sighted. With _pince-nez_."\r\n\r\n"Not very well lately?"\r\n\r\n"No--I think not. He takes medicine in the office. But you will be\r\ncareful, eh? He must not know."\r\n\r\n"Do you think so? Perhaps I may tell him, though."\r\n\r\n"Tell him? _Ciel_--no! You must not tell people! No!"\r\n\r\n"Shall I throw the whole case over, and keep your deposit fee?"\r\n\r\n"No--no, not that. But it is foolish to tell to people!"\r\n\r\n"I am to judge what is foolish and what wise, M. Bouvier. Good evening!"\r\n\r\n"Good evening, M. Dorrington; good evening." Bouvier followed him out\r\nto the gate. "And will you tell me--do you think there is a way to get\r\nthe diamond? Have you any plan?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, M. Bouvier, I have a plan. But, as I have said, that is my\r\nbusiness. It may be a successful plan, or it may not; that we shall\r\nsee."\r\n\r\n"And--and the _dossier_. The notes that you so marvellously have,\r\nwritten out in the book you read. When this business is over you will\r\ndestroy them, eh? You will not leave a clue?"\r\n\r\n"The notes that I have in my books," answered Dorrington, without\r\nrelaxing a muscle of his face, "are my property, for my own purposes,\r\nand were mine before you came to me. Those relating to you are a mere\r\nitem in thousands. So long as you behave well, M. Bouvier, they will\r\nnot harm you, and, as I said, the confidences of a client are sacred\r\nto Dorrington & Hicks. But as to keeping them--certainly I shall. Once\r\nmore--good evening!"\r\n\r\nEven the stony-faced Dorrington could not repress a smile and something\r\nvery like a chuckle as he turned the end of the street and struck out\r\nacross Golden Square towards his rooms in Conduit Street. The simple\r\nFrenchman, only half a rogue--even less than half--was now bamboozled\r\nand put aside as effectually as his cousin had been. Certainly there\r\nwas a diamond, and an immense one; if only the Bouvier tradition were\r\ntrue, probably the famous "Mirror of Portugal"; and nothing stood\r\nbetween Dorrington and absolute possession of that diamond but an\r\nordinary sort of case such as he dealt with every day. And he had made\r\nBouvier pay a fee for the privilege of putting him completely on the\r\ntrack of it! Dorrington smiled again.\r\n\r\nHis dinner was spoilt by waiting, but he troubled little of that. He\r\nspread before him, and examined again, the pieces of glass and the\r\ncork. The bottle had been a druggist\'s ordinary flat bottle, graduated\r\nwith dose-marks, and altogether seven inches high, or thereabout. It\r\nhad, without a doubt, contained the chloroform wherewith L\xc3\xa9on Bouvier\r\nhad been assaulted, as Dorrington had judged from the smell of the\r\ncork. The fact of the bottle being corked showed that the chloroform\r\nhad not been bought all at once--since in that case it would have been\r\nput up in a stoppered bottle. More probably it had been procured in\r\nvery small quantities (ostensibly for toothache, or something of that\r\nkind) at different druggists, and put together in this larger bottle,\r\nwhich had originally been used for something else. The bottle had\r\nbeen distinguished by a label--the usual white label affixed by the\r\ndruggist, with directions as to taking the medicine--and this label\r\nhad been scraped off; all except a small piece at the bottom edge by\r\nthe right hand side, whereon might be just distinguished the greater\r\npart of the letters N, E. The piece of glass that had lain a little way\r\napart from the bottle was not a part of it, as a casual observer might\r\nhave supposed. It was a fragment of a concave lens, with a channel\r\nground in the edge.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAt ten precisely next morning, as usual, Mr. Ludwig Hamer mounted the\r\nstairs of the house in Hatton Garden, wherein he rented half a room\r\nas office. He was a tall, fair man, wearing thick convex _pince-nez_.\r\nHe spoke English like a native, and, indeed, he called himself an\r\nEnglishman, though there were those who doubted the Briticism of his\r\nname. Scarce had he entered his office when Dorrington followed him.\r\n\r\nThe room had never been a very large one, and now a partition divided\r\nit in two, leaving a passage at one side only, by the window. On each\r\nside of this partition stood a small pedestal table, a couple of\r\nchairs, a copying-press, and the other articles usual in a meagrely\r\nfurnished office. Dorrington strode past Bouvier\'s half of the room\r\nand came upon Hamer as he was hanging his coat on a peg. The letter\r\nof introduction had been burnt, since Dorrington had only asked for\r\nit in order to get Hamer\'s name and the Hatton Garden address without\r\nbetraying to Bouvier the fact that he did not already know all about it.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, Mr. Hamer," said Dorrington, loudly. "Sorry to see\r\nyou\'re not well"--he pointed familiarly with his stick at a range of\r\nmedicine bottles on the mantelpiece--"but it\'s very trying weather, of\r\ncourse. You\'ve been suffering from toothache, I believe?"\r\n\r\nHamer seemed at first disposed to resent the loudness and familiarity\r\nof this speech, but at the reference to toothache he started suddenly\r\nand set his lips.\r\n\r\n"Chloroform\'s a capital thing for toothache, Mr. Hamer, and for--for\r\nother things. I\'m not in your line of business myself, but I believe\r\nit has even been used in the diamond trade."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" asked Hamer, flushing angrily.\r\n\r\n"Mean? Why, bless me--nothing more than I said. By the way, I\'m afraid\r\nyou dropped one of your medicine bottles last night. I\'ve brought it\r\nback, though I\'m afraid it\'s past repair. It\'s a good job you didn\'t\r\nquite clear the label off before you took it out with you, else I might\r\nhave had a difficulty." Dorrington placed the fragments on the table.\r\n"You see you\'ve just left the first letter of \'E.C.\' in the druggist\'s\r\naddress, and the last \'N\' of Hatton Garden, just before it. There\r\ndoesn\'t happen to be any other Garden in E.C. district that I know of,\r\nnor does the name of any other thoroughfare end in N--they are mostly\r\nstreets, or lanes, or courts, you see. And there seems to be only one\r\ndruggist in Hatton Garden--capital fellow, no doubt--the one whose name\r\nand address I observe on those bottles on the mantelpiece."\r\n\r\nDorrington stood with his foot on a chair, and tapped his knee\r\ncarelessly with his stick. Hamer dropped into the other chair and\r\nregarded him with a frown, though his face was pale. Presently he said,\r\nin a strained voice, "Well?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; there _is_ something else, Mr. Hamer, as you appear to suggest.\r\nI see you\'re wearing a new pair of glasses this morning; pity you\r\nbroke the others last night, but I\'ve brought the piece you left\r\nbehind." He gathered up the broken bottle, and held up the piece of\r\nconcave lens. "I think, after all, it\'s really best to use a cord with\r\n_pince-nez_. It\'s awkward, and it catches in things, I know, but it\r\nsaves a breakage, and you\'re liable to get the glasses knocked off, you\r\nknow--in certain circumstances."\r\n\r\nHamer sprang to his feet with a snarl, slammed the door, locked it, and\r\nturned on Dorrington. But now Dorrington had a revolver in his hand,\r\nthough his manner was as genial as ever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "DORRINGTON HAD A REVOLVER IN HIS HAND."]\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," he said; "best to shut the door, of course. People listen,\r\ndon\'t they? But sit down again. I\'m not anxious to hurt you, and, as\r\nyou will perceive, you\'re quite unable to hurt me. What I chiefly came\r\nto say is this: last evening my client, M. L\xc3\xa9on Bouvier, of this office\r\nand the Caf\xc3\xa9 des Bons Camarades, was attacked in the passage adjoining\r\nhis house by a man who was waiting for him, with a woman--was it really\r\nMrs. Hamer? but there, I won\'t ask--keeping watch. He was robbed of\r\na small old wooden box, containing charcoal and--a diamond. My name is\r\nDorrington--firm of Dorrington & Hicks, which you may have heard of.\r\nThat\'s my card. I\'ve come to take away that diamond."\r\n\r\nHamer was pale and angry, but, in his way, was almost as calm as\r\nDorrington. He put down the card without looking at it. "I don\'t\r\nunderstand you," he said. "How do you know I\'ve got it?"\r\n\r\n"Come, come, Mr. Hamer," Dorrington replied, rubbing the barrel of his\r\nrevolver on his knee, "that\'s hardly worthy of you. You\'re a man of\r\nbusiness, with a head on your shoulders--the sort of man I like doing\r\nbusiness with, in fact. Men like ourselves needn\'t trifle. I\'ve shown\r\nyou most of the cards I hold, though not all, I assure you. I\'ll tell\r\nyou, if you like, all about your little tour round among the druggists\r\nwith the convenient toothache, all about the evenings on which you\r\nwatched Bouvier home, and so on. But, really, need we, as men of the\r\nworld, descend to such peddling detail?"\r\n\r\n"Well, suppose I have got it, and suppose I refuse to give it you. What\r\nthen?"\r\n\r\n"What then? But why should we talk of unpleasant things? You won\'t\r\nrefuse, you know."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean you\'d get it out of me by help of that pistol?"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Dorrington, deliberately, "the pistol is noisy, and it\r\nmakes a mess, and all that, but it\'s a useful thing, and I _might_ do\r\nit with that, you know, in certain circumstances. But I wasn\'t thinking\r\nof it--there\'s a much less troublesome way."\r\n\r\n"Which?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re a slower man than I took you for, Mr. Hamer--or perhaps you\r\nhaven\'t quite appreciated _me_ yet. If I were to go to that window and\r\ncall the police, what with the little bits of evidence in my pocket,\r\nand the other little bits that the druggists who sold the chloroform\r\nwould give, and the other bits in reserve, that I prefer not to talk\r\nabout just now--there would be rather an awkwardly complete case of\r\nrobbery with violence, wouldn\'t there? And you\'d have to lose the\r\ndiamond after all, to say nothing of a little rest in gaol and general\r\nruination."\r\n\r\n"That sounds very well, but what about your client? Come now, you call\r\nme a man of the world, and I am one. How will your client account for\r\nthe possession of a diamond worth eighty thousand pounds or so? He\r\ndoesn\'t seem a millionaire. The police would want to know about him as\r\nwell as about me, if you were such a fool as to bring them in. Where\r\ndid _he_ steal it, eh?"\r\n\r\nDorrington smiled and bowed at the question. "That\'s a very good\r\ncard to play, Mr. Hamer," he said, "a capital card, really. To a\r\nsuperficial observer it might look like winning the trick. But I think\r\nI can trump it." He bent farther forward and tapped the table with the\r\npistol-barrel. "Suppose I don\'t care one solitary dump what becomes of\r\nmy client? Suppose I don\'t care whether he goes to gaol or stays out of\r\nit--in short, suppose I prefer my own interests to his?"\r\n\r\n"Ho! ho!" Hamer cried. "I begin to understand. You want to grab the\r\ndiamond for yourself then?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t said anything of the kind, Mr. Hamer," Dorrington replied,\r\nsuavely. "I have simply demanded the diamond which you stole last\r\nnight, and I have mentioned an alternative."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, yes, but we understand one another. Come, we\'ll arrange this.\r\nHow much do you want?"\r\n\r\nDorrington stared at him stonily. "I--I beg your pardon," he said, "but\r\nI don\'t understand. I want the diamond you stole."\r\n\r\n"But come now, we\'ll divide. Bouvier had no right to it, and he\'s out.\r\nYou and I, perhaps, haven\'t much right to it, legally, but it\'s between\r\nus, and we\'re both in the same position."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me," Dorrington replied, silkily, "but there you mistake. We\r\nare _not_ in the same position, by a long way. You are liable to an\r\ninstant criminal prosecution. I have simply come, authorised by my\r\nclient, who bears all the responsibility, to demand a piece of property\r\nwhich you have stolen. That is the difference between our positions,\r\nMr. Hamer. Come now, a policeman is just standing opposite. Shall I\r\nopen the window and call him, or do you give in?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I give in, I suppose," Hamer groaned. "But you\'re a deal too hard.\r\nA man of your abilities shouldn\'t be so mean."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right and reasonable," Dorrington answered briskly. "The wise\r\nman is the man who knows when he is beaten, and saves further trouble.\r\nYou may not find me so mean after all, but I must have the stone first.\r\nI hold the trumps, and I\'m not going to let the other player make\r\nconditions. Where\'s the diamond?"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t here--it\'s at home. You\'ll have to get it out of Mrs. Hamer.\r\nShall I go and wire to her?"\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Dorrington, "that\'s not the way. We\'ll just go together,\r\nand take Mrs. Hamer by surprise, I think. I mustn\'t let you out of\r\nsight, you know. Come, we\'ll get a hansom. Is it far?"\r\n\r\n"Bessborough Street, Pimlico. You\'ll find Mrs. Hamer has a temper of\r\nher own."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, we all have our failings. But before we start, now,\r\nobserve." For a moment Dorrington was stern and menacing. "You wriggled\r\na little at first, but that was quite natural. Now you\'ve given in;\r\nand at the first sign of another wriggle I stop it once and for all.\r\nUnderstand? No tricks, now."\r\n\r\nThey entered a hansom at the door. Hamer was moody and silent at first,\r\nbut under the influence of Dorrington\'s gay talk he opened out after\r\na while. "Well," he said, "you\'re far the cleverest of the three, no\r\ndoubt, and perhaps in that way you deserve to win. It\'s mighty smart\r\nfor you to come in like this, and push Bouvier on one side and me on\r\nthe other, and both of us helpless. But it\'s rough on me after having\r\nall the trouble."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be a bad loser, man!" Dorrington answered. "You might have had a\r\ndeal more trouble and a deal more roughness too, I assure you."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, so I might. I\'m not grumbling. But there\'s one thing has\r\npuzzled me all along. Where did Bouvier get that stone from?"\r\n\r\n"He inherited it. It\'s the most important of the family jewels, I\r\nassure you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, skittles! I might have known you wouldn\'t tell me, even if you\r\nknew yourself. But I should like to know. What sort of a duffer must\r\nit have been that let Bouvier do him for that big stone--Bouvier of\r\nall men in the world? Why, he was a record flat himself--couldn\'t tell\r\na diamond from a glass marble, I should think. Why, he used to buy\r\npeddling little trays of rotters in the Garden at twice their value!\r\nAnd then he\'d sell them for what he could get. I knew very well he\r\nwasn\'t going on systematically dropping money like that for no reason\r\nat all. He had some axe to grind, that was plain. And after a while he\r\ngot asking timid questions as to the sale of big diamonds, and how it\r\nwas done, and who bought them, and all that. That put me on it at once.\r\nAll this buying and selling at a loss was a blind. He wanted to get\r\ninto the trade to sell stolen diamonds, that was clear; and there was\r\nsome value in them too, else he couldn\'t afford to waste months of time\r\nand lose money every day over it. So I kept my eye on him. I noticed,\r\nwhen he put his overcoat on, and thought I wasn\'t looking, he would\r\nsettle a string of some sort round his neck, under his shirt-collar,\r\nand feel to pack up something close under his armpit. Then I just\r\nwatched him home, and saw the sort of shanty he lived in. I mentioned\r\nthese things to Mrs. H., and she was naturally indignant at the idea of\r\na chap like Bouvier having something valuable in a dishonest way, and\r\nagreed with me that if possible it ought to be got from him, if only\r\nin the interests of virtue." Hamer laughed jerkily. "So at any rate we\r\ndetermined to get a look at whatever it was hanging round his neck, and\r\nwe made the arrangements you know about. It seemed to me that Bouvier\r\nwas pretty sure to lose it before long, one way or another, if it had\r\nany value at all, to judge by the way he was done in other matters.\r\nBut I assure you I nearly fell down like Bouvier himself when I saw\r\nwhat it was. No wonder we left the bottle behind where I\'d dropped it,\r\nafter soaking the shawl--I wonder I didn\'t leave the shawl itself, and\r\nmy hat, and everything. I assure you we sat up half last night looking\r\nat that wonderful stone!"\r\n\r\n"No doubt. I shall have a good look at it myself, I assure you. Here is\r\nBessborough Street. Which is the number?"\r\n\r\nThey alighted, and entered a house rather smaller than those about it.\r\n"Ask Mrs. Hamer to come here," said Hamer, gloomily, to the servant.\r\n\r\nThe men sat in the drawing-room. Presently Mrs. Hamer entered--a\r\nshortish, sharp, keen-eyed woman of forty-five. "This is Mr.\r\nDorrington," said Hamer, "of Dorrington & Hicks, private detectives. He\r\nwants us to give him that diamond."\r\n\r\nThe little woman gave a sort of involuntary bounce, and exclaimed.\r\n"What? Diamond? What d\'ye mean?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s no good, Maria," Hamer answered dolefully. "I\'ve tried it\r\nevery way myself. One comfort is we\'re safe, as long as we give it\r\nup. Here," he added, turning to Dorrington, "show her some of your\r\nevidence--that\'ll convince her."\r\n\r\nVery politely Dorrington brought forth, with full explanations, the\r\ncork and the broken glass; while Mrs. Hamer, biting hard at her thin\r\nlips, grew shinier and redder in the face every moment, and her hard\r\ngray eyes flashed fury.\r\n\r\n"And you let this man," she burst out to her husband, when Dorrington\r\nhad finished, "you let this man leave your office with these things in\r\nhis possession after he had shown them to you, and you as big as he is,\r\nand bigger! Coward!"\r\n\r\n"My dear, you don\'t appreciate Mr. Dorrington\'s forethought, hang it! I\r\nmade preparations for the very line of action you recommend, but he was\r\nready. He brought out a very well kept revolver, and he has it in his\r\npocket now!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hamer only glared, speechless with anger.\r\n\r\n"You might just get Mr. Dorrington a whisky and soda, Maria," Hamer\r\npursued, with a slight lift of the eyebrows which he did not intend\r\nDorrington to see. The woman was on her feet in a moment.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, no," interposed Dorrington, rising also, "I won\'t trouble\r\nyou. I\'d rather not drink anything just now, and, although I fear I\r\nmay appear rude, I can\'t allow either of you to leave the room. In\r\nshort," he added, "I must stay with you both till I get the diamond."\r\n\r\n"And this man Bouvier," asked Mrs. Hamer, "what is his right to the\r\nstone?"\r\n\r\n"Really, I don\'t feel competent to offer an opinion, do you know,"\r\nDorrington answered sweetly. "To tell the truth, M. Bouvier doesn\'t\r\ninterest me very much."\r\n\r\n"No go, Maria!" growled Hamer. "I\'ve tried it all. The fact is we\'ve\r\ngot to give Dorrington the diamond. If we don\'t he\'ll just call in the\r\npolice--then we shall lose diamond and everything else too. He doesn\'t\r\ncare what becomes of Bouvier. He\'s got us, that\'s what it is. He won\'t\r\neven bargain to give us a share."\r\n\r\nMrs. Hamer looked quickly up. "Oh, but that\'s nonsense!" she said.\r\n"We\'ve got the thing. We ought at least to say halves."\r\n\r\nHer sharp eyes searched Dorrington\'s face, but there was no\r\nencouragement in it. "I am sorry to disappoint a lady," he said, "but\r\nthis time it is my business to impose terms, not to submit to them.\r\nCome, the diamond!"\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'ll give us something, surely?" the woman cried.\r\n\r\n"Nothing is sure, madam, except that you will give me that diamond, or\r\nface a policeman in five minutes!"\r\n\r\nThe woman realised her helplessness. "Well," she said, "much good may\r\nit do you. You\'ll have to come and get it--I\'m keeping it somewhere\r\nelse. I\'ll go and get my hat."\r\n\r\nAgain Dorrington interposed. "I think we\'ll send your servant for the\r\nhat," he said, reaching for the bell-rope. "I\'ll come wherever you\r\nlike, but I shall not leave you till this affair is settled, I promise\r\nyou. And, as I reminded your husband a little time ago, you\'ll find\r\ntricks come expensive."\r\n\r\nThe servant brought Mrs. Hamer\'s hat and cloak, and that lady put them\r\non, her eyes ablaze with anger. Dorrington made the pair walk before\r\nhim to the front door, and followed them into the street. "Now," he\r\nsaid, "where is this place? Remember, no tricks!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hamer turned towards Vauxhall Bridge. "It\'s just over by Upper\r\nKennington Lane," she said. "Not far."\r\n\r\nShe paced out before them, Dorrington and Hamer following, the former\r\naffable and business-like, the latter apparently a little puzzled.\r\nWhen they came about the middle of the bridge, the woman turned\r\nsuddenly. "Come, Mr. Dorrington," she said, in a more subdued voice\r\nthan she had yet used, "I give in. It\'s no use trying to shake you off,\r\nI can see. I have the diamond with me. Here."\r\n\r\nShe put a little old black wooden box in his hand. He made to open\r\nthe lid, which fitted tightly, and at that moment the woman, pulling\r\nher other hand free from under her cloak, flung away over the parapet\r\nsomething that shone like fifty points of electric light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "THERE\'S YOUR DIAMOND, YOU DIRTY THIEF!"]\r\n\r\n"There it goes!" she screamed aloud, pointing with her finger. "There\'s\r\nyour diamond, you dirty thief! You bully! Go after it now, you spy!"\r\n\r\nThe great diamond made a curve of glitter and disappeared into the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nFor the moment Dorrington lost his cool temper. He seized the woman by\r\nthe arm. "Do you know what you\'ve done, you wild cat?" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do!" the woman screamed, almost foaming with passion, while\r\nboys began to collect, though there had been but few people on the\r\nbridge. "Yes, I do! And now you can do what you please, you thief! you\r\nbully!"\r\n\r\nDorrington was calm again in a moment. He shrugged his shoulders and\r\nturned away. Hamer was frightened. He came at Dorrington\'s side and\r\nfaltered, "I--I told you she had a temper. What will you do?"\r\n\r\nDorrington forced a laugh. "Oh, nothing," he said. "What can I do?\r\nLocking you up now wouldn\'t fetch the diamond back. And besides I\'m\r\nnot sure that Mrs. Hamer won\'t attend to your punishment faithfully\r\nenough." And he walked briskly away.\r\n\r\n"What did she do, Bill?" asked one boy of another.\r\n\r\n"Why, didn\'t ye see? She chucked that man\'s watch in the river."\r\n\r\n"Garn! that wasn\'t his watch!" interrupted a third, "it was a little\r\nglass tumbler. I see it!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Have you got my diamond?" asked the agonised L\xc3\xa9on Bouvier of\r\nDorrington a day later.\r\n\r\n"No, I have not," Dorrington replied drily. "Nor has your cousin\r\nJacques. But I know where it is, and you can get it as easily as I."\r\n\r\n"_Mon Dieu!_ Where?"\r\n\r\n"At the bottom of the river Thames, exactly in the centre, rather to\r\nthe right of Vauxhall Bridge, looking from this side. I expect it will\r\nbe rediscovered in some future age, when the bed of the Thames is a\r\ndiamond field."\r\n\r\nThe rest of Bouvier\'s savings went in the purchase of a boat, and\r\nin this, with a pail on a long rope, he was very busy for some time\r\nafterward. But he only got a great deal of mud into his boat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _THE AFFAIR OF THE "AVALANCHE\r\n  BICYCLE AND TYRE CO., LIMITED"_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe Affair of the "Avalanche Bicycle and Tyre Co., Limited"\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nCycle companies were in the market everywhere. Immense fortunes were\r\nbeing made in a few days and sometimes little fortunes were being\r\nlost to build them up. Mining shares were dull for a season, and any\r\ncompany with the word "cycle" or "tyre" in its title was certain to\r\nattract capital, no matter what its prospects were like in the eyes\r\nof the expert. All the old private cycle companies suddenly were\r\noffered to the public, and their proprietors, already rich men, built\r\nthemselves houses on the Riviera, bought yachts, ran racehorses, and\r\nleft business for ever. Sometimes the shareholders got their money\'s\r\nworth, sometimes more, sometimes less--sometimes they got nothing\r\nbut total loss; but still the game went on. One could never open a\r\nnewspaper without finding, displayed at large, the prospectus of yet\r\nanother cycle company with capital expressed in six figures at least,\r\noften in seven. Solemn old dailies, into whose editorial heads no\r\nnew thing ever found its way till years after it had been forgotten\r\nelsewhere, suddenly exhibited the scandalous phenomenon of "broken\r\ncolumns" in their advertising sections, and the universal prospectuses\r\nstretched outrageously across half or even all the page--a thing to\r\ncause apoplexy in the bodily system of any self-respecting manager of\r\nthe old school.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this excitement it chanced that the firm of Dorrington\r\n& Hicks were engaged upon an investigation for the famous and\r\nlong-established "Indestructible Bicycle and Tricycle Manufacturing\r\nCompany," of London and Coventry. The matter was not one of sufficient\r\nintricacy or difficulty to engage Dorrington\'s personal attention,\r\nand it was given to an assistant. There was some doubt as to the\r\nvalidity of a certain patent having reference to a particular method\r\nof tightening the spokes and truing the wheels of a bicycle, and\r\nDorrington\'s assistant had to make inquiries (without attracting\r\nattention to the matter) as to whether or not there existed any\r\nevidence, either documentary or in the memory of veterans, of the\r\nuse of this method, or anything like it, before the year 1885. The\r\nassistant completed his inquiries and made his report to Dorrington.\r\nNow I think I have said that, from every evidence I have seen, the\r\nchief matter of Dorrington\'s solicitude was his own interest, and just\r\nat this time he had heard, as had others, much of the money being made\r\nin cycle companies. Also, like others, he had conceived a great desire\r\nto get the confidential advice of somebody "in the know"--advice which\r\nmight lead him into the "good thing" desired by all the greedy who\r\nflutter about at the outside edge of the stock and share market. For\r\nthis reason Dorrington determined to make this small matter of the\r\nwheel patent an affair of personal report. He was a man of infinite\r\nresource, plausibility and good-companionship, and there was money\r\ngoing in the cycle trade. Why then should he lose an opportunity\r\nof making himself pleasant in the inner groves of that trade, and\r\ncatch whatever might come his way--information, syndicate shares,\r\ndirectorships, anything? So that Dorrington made himself master of\r\nhis assistant\'s information, and proceeded to the head office of the\r\n"Indestructible" company on Holborn Viaduct, resolved to become the\r\nentertaining acquaintance of the managing director.\r\n\r\nOn his way his attention was attracted by a very elaborately fitted\r\ncycle shop, which his recollection told him was new. "The Avalanche\r\nBicycle and Tyre Company" was the legend gilt above the great\r\nplate-glass window, and in the window itself stood many brilliantly\r\nenamelled and plated bicycles, each labelled on the frame with the\r\nflaming red and gold transfer of the firm; and in the midst of all was\r\nanother bicycle covered with dried mud, of which, however, sufficient\r\nhad been carefully cleared away to expose a similar glaring transfer\r\nto those that decorated the rest--with a placard announcing that on\r\nthis particular machine somebody had ridden some incredible distance on\r\nbad roads in very little more than no time at all. A crowd stood about\r\nthe window and gaped respectfully at the placard, the bicycles, the\r\ntransfers, and the mud, though they paid little attention to certain\r\npiles of folded white papers, endorsed in bold letters with the name\r\nof the company, with the suffix "limited" and the word "prospectus"\r\nin bloated black letter below. These, however, Dorrington observed at\r\nonce, for he had himself that morning, in common with several thousand\r\nother people, received one by post. Also half a page of his morning\r\npaper had been filled with a copy of that same prospectus, and the\r\nafternoon had brought another copy in the evening paper. In the list of\r\ndirectors there was a titled name or two, together with a few unknown\r\nnames--doubtless the "practical men." And below this list there were\r\nsuch positive promises of tremendous dividends, backed up and proved\r\nbeyond dispute by such ingenious piles of business-like figures, every\r\nline of figures referring to some other line for testimonials to its\r\nperfect genuineness and accuracy, that any reasonable man, it would\r\nseem, must instantly sell the hat off his head and the boots off his\r\nfeet to buy one share at least, and so make his fortune for ever.\r\nTrue, the business was but lately established, but that was just it.\r\nIt had rushed ahead with such amazing rapidity (as was natural with an\r\navalanche) that it had got altogether out of hand, and orders couldn\'t\r\nbe executed at all; wherefore the proprietors were reluctantly\r\ncompelled to let the public have some of the luck. This was Thursday.\r\nThe share list was to be opened on Monday morning and closed inexorably\r\nat four o\'clock on Tuesday afternoon, with a merciful extension to\r\nWednesday morning for the candidates for wealth who were so unfortunate\r\nas to live in the country. So that it behoved everybody to waste no\r\ntime lest he be numbered among the unlucky whose subscription-money\r\nshould be returned in full, failing allotment. The prospectus did not\r\nabsolutely say it in so many words, but no rational person could fail\r\nto feel that the directors were fervently hoping that nobody would get\r\ninjured in the rush.\r\n\r\nDorrington passed on and reached the well-known establishment of the\r\n"Indestructible Bicycle Company." This was already a limited company of\r\na private sort, and had been so for ten years or more. And before that\r\nthe concern had had eight or nine years of prosperous experience. The\r\nfounder of the firm, Mr. Paul Mallows, was now the managing director,\r\nand a great pillar of the cycling industry. Dorrington gave a clerk his\r\ncard, and asked to see Mr. Mallows.\r\n\r\nMr. Mallows was out, it seemed, but Mr. Stedman, the secretary, was\r\nin, and him Dorrington saw. Mr. Stedman was a pleasant, youngish man,\r\nwho had been a famous amateur bicyclist in his time, and was still an\r\nenthusiast. In ten minutes business was settled and dismissed, and\r\nDorrington\'s tact had brought the secretary into a pleasant discursive\r\nchat, with much exchange of anecdote. Dorrington expressed much\r\ninterest in the subject of bicycling, and, seeing that Stedman had been\r\na racing man, particularly as to bicycling races.\r\n\r\n"There\'ll be a rare good race on Saturday, I expect," Stedman said. "Or\r\nrather," he went on, "I expect the fifty miles record will go. I fancy\r\nour man Gillett is pretty safe to win, but he\'ll have to move, and I\r\nquite expect to see a good set of new records on our advertisements\r\nnext week. The next best man is Lant--the new fellow, you know--who\r\nrides for the \'Avalanche\' people."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s see, they\'re going to the public as a limited company, aren\'t\r\nthey?" Dorrington asked casually.\r\n\r\nStedman nodded, with a little grimace.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think it\'s a good thing, perhaps," Dorrington said,\r\nnoticing the grimace. "Is that so?"\r\n\r\n"Well," Stedman answered, "of course I can\'t say. I don\'t know much\r\nabout the firm--nobody does, as far as I can tell--but they seem\r\nto have got a business together in almost no time; that is, if the\r\nbusiness is as genuine as it looks at first sight. But they want a\r\nrare lot of capital, and then the prospectus--well, I\'ve seen more\r\nsatisfactory ones, you know. I don\'t say it isn\'t all right, of course,\r\nbut still I shan\'t go out of my way to recommend any friends of mine to\r\nplunge on it."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t?"\r\n\r\n"No, I won\'t. Though no doubt they\'ll get their capital, or most of it.\r\nAlmost any cycle or tyre company can get subscribed just now. And this\r\n\'Avalanche\' affair is both, and it is so well advertised, you know.\r\nLant has been winning on their mounts just lately, and they\'ve been\r\nbooming it for all they\'re worth. By Jove, if they could only screw him\r\nup to win the fifty miles on Saturday, and beat our man Gillett, that\r\n_would_ give them a push! Just at the correct moment too. Gillett\'s\r\nnever been beaten yet at the distance, you know. But Lant can\'t do\r\nit--though, as I have said, he\'ll make some fast riding--it\'ll be a\r\nrace, I tell you!"\r\n\r\n"I should like to see it."\r\n\r\n"Why not come? See about it, will you? And perhaps you\'d like to\r\nrun down to the track after dinner this evening and see our man\r\ntraining--awfully interesting, I can tell you, with all the pacing\r\nmachinery and that. Will you come?"\r\n\r\nDorrington expressed himself delighted, and suggested that Stedman\r\nshould dine with him before going to the track. Stedman, for his part,\r\ncharmed with his new acquaintance--as everybody was at a first meeting\r\nwith Dorrington--assented gladly.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the door of Stedman\'s room was pushed open and a\r\nwell-dressed, middle-aged man, with a shaven, flabby face, appeared.\r\n"I beg pardon," he said, "I thought you were alone. I\'ve just ripped\r\nmy finger against the handle of my brougham door as I came in--the\r\nscrew sticks out. Have you a piece of sticking plaster?" He extended a\r\nbleeding finger as he spoke. Stedman looked doubtfully at his desk.\r\n\r\n"Here is some court plaster," Dorrington exclaimed, producing his\r\npocket-book. "I always carry it--it\'s handier than ordinary sticking\r\nplaster. How much do you want?"\r\n\r\n"Thanks--an inch or so."\r\n\r\n"This is Mr. Dorrington, of Messrs. Dorrington & Hicks, Mr. Mallows,"\r\nStedman said. "Our managing director, Mr. Paul Mallows, Mr. Dorrington."\r\n\r\nDorrington was delighted to make Mr. Mallows\'s acquaintance, and he\r\nbusied himself with a careful strapping of the damaged finger. Mr.\r\nMallows had the large frame of a man of strong build who has had much\r\nhard bodily work, but there hung about it the heavier, softer flesh\r\nthat told of a later period of ease and sloth. "Ah, Mr. Mallows,"\r\nStedman said, "the bicycle\'s the safest thing, after all! Dangerous\r\nthings these broughams!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, you younger men," Mr. Mallows replied, with a slow and rounded\r\nenunciation, "you younger men can afford to be active. We elders----"\r\n\r\n"Can afford a brougham," Dorrington added, before the managing director\r\nbegan the next word. "Just so--and the bicycle does it all; wonderful\r\nthing the bicycle!"\r\n\r\nDorrington had not misjudged his man, and the oblique reference to his\r\nwealth flattered Mr. Mallows. Dorrington went once more through his\r\nreport as to the spoke patent, and then Mr. Mallows bade him good-bye.\r\n\r\n"Good-day, Mr. Dorrington, good-day," he said. "I am extremely obliged\r\nby your careful personal attention to this matter of the patent. We may\r\nleave it with Mr. Stedman now, I think. Good-day. I hope soon to have\r\nthe pleasure of meeting you again." And with clumsy stateliness Mr.\r\nMallows vanished.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n"So you don\'t think the \'Avalanche\' good business as an investment?"\r\nDorrington said once more as he and Stedman, after an excellent dinner,\r\nwere cabbing it to the track.\r\n\r\n"No, no," Stedman answered, "don\'t touch it! There\'s better things\r\nthan that coming along presently. Perhaps I shall be able to put you\r\nin for something, you know, a bit later; but don\'t be in a hurry. As\r\nto the \'Avalanche,\' even if everything else were satisfactory, there\'s\r\ntoo much \'booming\' being done just now to please me. All sorts of\r\nrumours, you know, of their having something \'up their sleeve,\' and\r\nso on; mysterious hints in the papers, and all that, as to something\r\nrevolutionary being in hand with the \'Avalanche\' people. Perhaps there\r\nis. But why they don\'t fetch it out in view of the public subscription\r\nfor shares is more than I can understand, unless they don\'t want too\r\nmuch of a rush. And as to that, well they don\'t look like modestly\r\nshrinking from anything of that sort up to the present."\r\n\r\nThey were at the track soon after seven o\'clock, but Gillett was not\r\nyet riding. Dorrington remarked that Gillett appeared to begin late.\r\n\r\n"Well," Stedman explained, "he\'s one of those fellows that afternoon\r\ntraining doesn\'t seem to suit, unless it is a bit of walking exercise.\r\nHe just does a few miles in the morning and a spurt or two, and then he\r\ncomes on just before sunset for a fast ten or fifteen miles--that is,\r\nwhen he is getting fit for such a race as Saturday\'s. To-night will be\r\nhis last spin of that length before Saturday, because to-morrow will be\r\nthe day before the race. To-morrow he\'ll only go a spurt or two, and\r\nrest most of the day."\r\n\r\nThey strolled about inside the track, the two highly "banked" ends\r\nwhereof seemed to a nearsighted person in the centre to be solid\r\nerect walls, along the face of which the training riders skimmed,\r\nfly-fashion. Only three or four persons beside themselves were in the\r\nenclosure when they first came, but in ten minutes\' time Mr. Paul\r\nMallows came across the track.\r\n\r\n"Why," said Stedman to Dorrington, "here\'s the Governor! It isn\'t often\r\nhe comes down here. But I expect he\'s anxious to see how Gillett\'s\r\ngoing, in view of Saturday."\r\n\r\n"Good evening, Mr. Mallows," said Dorrington. "I hope the finger\'s all\r\nright? Want any more plaster?"\r\n\r\n"Good evening, good evening," responded Mr. Mallows heavily. "Thank\r\nyou, the finger\'s not troubling me a bit." He held it up, still\r\ndecorated by the black plaster. "Your plaster remains, you see--I was a\r\nlittle careful not to fray it too much in washing, that was all." And\r\nMr. Mallows sat down on a light iron garden-chair (of which several\r\nstood here and there in the enclosure) and began to watch the riding.\r\n\r\nThe track was clear, and dusk was approaching when at last the great\r\nGillett made his appearance on the track. He answered a friendly\r\nquestion or two put to him by Mallows and Stedman, and then, giving\r\nhis coat to his trainer, swung off along the track on his bicycle,\r\nled in front by a tandem and closely attended by a triplet. In fifty\r\nyards his pace quickened, and he settled down into a swift even pace,\r\nregular as clockwork. Sometimes the tandem and sometimes the triplet\r\nwent to the front, but Gillett neither checked nor heeded as, nursed by\r\nhis pacers, who were directed by the trainer from the centre, he swept\r\nalong mile after mile, each mile in but a few seconds over the two\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n"Look at the action!" exclaimed Stedman with enthusiasm. "Just watch\r\nhim. Not an ounce of power wasted there! Did you ever see more regular\r\nankle work? And did anybody ever sit a machine quite so well as that?\r\nShow me a movement anywhere above the hips!"\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Mr. Mallows, "Gillett has a wonderful style--a wonderful\r\nstyle, really!"\r\n\r\nThe men in the enclosure wandered about here and there on the grass,\r\nwatching Gillett\'s riding as one watches the performance of a great\r\npiece of art--which, indeed, was what Gillett\'s riding was. There were,\r\nbesides Mallows, Stedman, Dorrington and the trainer, two officials\r\nof the Cyclists\' Union, an amateur racing man named Sparks, the\r\ntrack superintendent and another man. The sky grew darker, and gloom\r\nfell about the track. The machines became invisible, and little could\r\nbe seen of the riders across the ground but the row of rhythmically\r\nworking legs and the white cap that Gillett wore. The trainer had just\r\ntold Stedman that there would be three fast laps and then his man would\r\ncome off the track.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Stedman," said Mr. Mallows, "I think we shall be all right\r\nfor Saturday."\r\n\r\n"Rather!" answered Stedman confidently. "Gillett\'s going great guns,\r\nand steady as a watch!"\r\n\r\nThe pace now suddenly increased. The tandem shot once more to the\r\nfront, the triplet hung on the rider\'s flank, and the group of swishing\r\nwheels flew round the track at a "one-fifty" gait. The spectators\r\nturned about, following the riders round the track with their eyes. And\r\nthen, swinging into the straight from the top bend, the tandem checked\r\nsuddenly and gave a little jump. Gillett crashed into it from behind,\r\nand the triplet, failing to clear, wavered and swung, and crashed over\r\nand along the track too. All three machines and six men were involved\r\nin one complicated smash.\r\n\r\nEverybody rushed across the grass, the trainer first. Then the cause\r\nof the disaster was seen. Lying on its side on the track, with men and\r\nbicycles piled over and against it, was one of the green painted light\r\niron garden-chairs that had been standing in the enclosure. The triplet\r\nmen were struggling to their feet, and though much cut and shaken,\r\nseemed the least hurt of the lot. One of the men of the tandem was\r\ninsensible, and Gillett, who from his position had got all the worst\r\nof it, lay senseless too, badly cut and bruised, and his left arm was\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\nThe trainer was cursing and tearing his hair. "If I knew who\'d done\r\nthis," Stedman cried, "I\'d _pulp_ him with that chair!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, that betting, that betting!" wailed Mr. Mallows, hopping about\r\ndistractedly; "see what it leads people into doing! It can\'t have been\r\nan accident, can it?"\r\n\r\n"Accident? Skittles! A man doesn\'t put a chair on a track in the dark\r\nand leave it there by accident. Is anybody getting away there from the\r\noutside of the track?"\r\n\r\n"No, there\'s nobody. He wouldn\'t wait till this; he\'s clear off a\r\nminute ago and more. Here, Fielders! Shut the outer gate, and we\'ll see\r\nwho\'s about."\r\n\r\nBut there seemed to be no suspicious character. Indeed, except for the\r\nground-man, his boy, Gillett\'s trainer, and a racing man, who had just\r\nfinished dressing in the pavilion, there seemed to be nobody about\r\nbeyond those whom everybody had seen standing in the enclosure. But\r\nthere had been ample time for anybody, standing unnoticed at the outer\r\nrails, to get across the track in the dark, just after the riders had\r\npassed, place the obstruction, and escape before the completion of the\r\nlap.\r\n\r\nThe damaged men were helped or carried into the pavilion, and the\r\ndamaged machines were dragged after them. "I will give fifty pounds\r\ngladly--more, a hundred," said Mr. Mallows, excitedly, "to anybody who\r\nwill find out who put that chair on the track. It might have ended in\r\nmurder. Some wretched bookmaker, I suppose, who has taken too many bets\r\non Gillett. As I\'ve said a thousand times, betting is the curse of all\r\nsport nowadays."\r\n\r\n"The governor excites himself a great deal about betting and\r\nbookmakers," Stedman said to Dorrington, as they walked toward the\r\npavilion, "but, between you and me, I believe some of the \'Avalanche\'\r\npeople are in this. The betting bee is always in Mallows\'s bonnet, but\r\nas a matter of fact there\'s very little betting at all on cycle races,\r\nand what there is is little more than a matter of half-crowns or at\r\nmost half-sovereigns on the day of the race. No bookmaker ever makes a\r\nheavy book first. Still there _may_ be something in it this time, of\r\ncourse. But look at the \'Avalanche\' people. With Gillett away their\r\nman can certainly win on Saturday, and if only the weather keeps fair\r\nhe can almost as certainly beat the record; just at present the fifty\r\nmiles is fairly easy, and it\'s bound to go soon. Indeed, our intention\r\nwas that Gillett should pull it down on Saturday. He was a safe winner,\r\nbar accidents, and it was good odds on his altering the record, if\r\nthe weather were any good at all. With Gillett out of it Lant is just\r\nabout as certain a winner as our man would be if all were well. And\r\nthere would be a boom for the \'Avalanche\' company, on the very eve\r\nof the share subscription! Lant, you must know, was very second-rate\r\ntill this season, but he has improved wonderfully in the last month or\r\ntwo, since he has been with the \'Avalanche\' people. Let him win, and\r\nthey can point to the machine as responsible for it all. \'Here,\' they\r\nwill say in effect, \'is a man who could rarely get in front, even in\r\nsecond-class company, till he rode an \'Avalanche.\' Now he beats the\r\nworld\'s record for fifty miles on it, and makes rings round the topmost\r\nprofessionals!\' Why, it will be worth thousands of capital to them. Of\r\ncourse the subscription of capital won\'t hurt us, but the loss of the\r\nrecord may, and to have Gillett knocked out like this in the middle of\r\nthe season is serious."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I suppose with you it is more than a matter of this one race."\r\n\r\n"Of course. And so it will be with the \'Avalanche\' company. Don\'t you\r\nsee, with Gillett probably useless for the rest of the season, Lant\r\nwill have it all his own way at anything over ten miles. That\'ll help\r\nto boom up the shares and there\'ll be big profit made on trading in\r\nthem. Oh, I tell you this thing seems pretty suspicious to me."\r\n\r\n"Look here," said Dorrington, "can you borrow a light for me, and let\r\nme run over with it to the spot where the smash took place? The people\r\nhave cleared into the pavilion, and I could go alone."\r\n\r\n"Certainly. Will you have a try for the governor\'s hundred?"\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps. But anyway there\'s no harm in doing you a good turn if\r\nI can, while I\'m here. Some day perhaps you\'ll do me one."\r\n\r\n"Right you are--I\'ll ask Fielders, the ground-man."\r\n\r\nA lantern was brought, and Dorrington betook himself to the spot where\r\nthe iron chair still lay, while Stedman joined the rest of the crowd in\r\nthe pavilion.\r\n\r\nDorrington minutely examined the grass within two yards of the place\r\nwhere the chair lay, and then, crossing the track and getting over the\r\nrails, did the same with the damp gravel that paved the outer ring.\r\nThe track itself was of cement, and unimpressionable by footmarks, but\r\nnevertheless he scrutinised that with equal care, as well as the rails.\r\nThen he turned his attention to the chair. It was, as I have said, a\r\nlight chair made of flat iron strip, bent to shape and riveted. It had\r\nseen good service, and its present coat of green paint was evidently\r\nfar from being its original one. Also it was rusty in places, and\r\nparts had been repaired and strengthened with cross-pieces secured by\r\nbolts and square nuts, some rusty and loose. It was from one of these\r\nsquare nuts, holding a cross-piece that stayed the back at the top,\r\nthat Dorrington secured some object--it might have been a hair--which\r\nhe carefully transferred to his pocket-book. This done, with one more\r\nglance round, he betook himself to the pavilion.\r\n\r\nA surgeon had arrived, and he reported well of the chief patient. It\r\nwas a simple fracture, and a healthy subject. When Dorrington entered,\r\npreparations were beginning for setting the limb. There was a sofa in\r\nthe pavilion, and the surgeon saw no reason for removing the patient\r\ntill all was made secure.\r\n\r\n"Found anything?" asked Stedman in a low tone of Dorrington.\r\n\r\nDorrington shook his head. "Not much," he answered at a whisper. "I\'ll\r\nthink over it later."\r\n\r\nDorrington asked one of the Cyclists\' Union officials for the loan of a\r\npencil, and, having made a note with it, immediately, in another part\r\nof the room, asked Sparks, the amateur, to lend him another.\r\n\r\nStedman had told Mr. Mallows of Dorrington\'s late employment with the\r\nlantern, and the managing director now said quietly, "You remember what\r\nI said about rewarding anybody who discovered the perpetrator of this\r\noutrage, Mr. Dorrington? Well, I was excited at the time, but I quite\r\nhold to it. It is a shameful thing. You have been looking about the\r\ngrounds, I hear. I hope you have come across something that will enable\r\nyou to find something out. Nothing will please me more than to have to\r\npay you, I\'m sure."\r\n\r\n"Well," Dorrington confessed, "I\'m afraid I haven\'t seen anything very\r\nbig in the way of a clue, Mr. Mallows; but I\'ll think a bit. The worst\r\nof it is, you never know who these betting men are, do you, once they\r\nget away? There are so many, and it may be anybody. Not only that, but\r\nthey may bribe anybody."\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course--there\'s no end to their wickedness, I\'m afraid.\r\nStedman suggests that trade rivalry may have had something to do with\r\nit. But that seems an uncharitable view, don\'t you think? Of course\r\nwe stand very high, and there are jealousies and all that, but this\r\nis a thing I\'m sure no firm would think of stooping to, for a moment.\r\nNo, it\'s betting that is at the bottom of this, I fear. And I hope,\r\nMr. Dorrington, that you will make some attempt to find the guilty\r\nparties."\r\n\r\nPresently Stedman spoke to Dorrington again. "Here\'s something that may\r\nhelp you," he said. "To begin with, it must have been done by some one\r\nfrom the outside of the track."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Well, at least every probability\'s that way. Everybody inside was\r\ndirectly interested in Gillett\'s success, excepting the Union officials\r\nand Sparks, who\'s a gentleman and quite above suspicion, as much so,\r\nindeed, as the Union officials. Of course there was the ground-man, but\r\nhe\'s all right, I\'m sure."\r\n\r\n"And the trainer?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s altogether improbable--altogether. I was going to say----"\r\n\r\n"And there\'s that other man who was standing about; I haven\'t heard who\r\nhe was."\r\n\r\n"Right you are. I don\'t know him either. Where is he now?"\r\n\r\nBut the man had gone.\r\n\r\n"Look here, I\'ll make some quiet inquiries about that man," Stedman\r\npursued. "I forgot all about him in the excitement of the moment. I was\r\ngoing to say that although whoever did it could easily have got away by\r\nthe gate before the smash came, he might not have liked to go that way\r\nin case of observation in passing the pavilion. In that case he could\r\nhave got away (and indeed he could have got into the grounds to begin\r\nwith) by way of one of those garden walls that bound the ground just by\r\nwhere the smash occurred. If that were so he must either live in one of\r\nthe houses, or he must know somebody that does. Perhaps you might put\r\na man to smell about along that road--it\'s only a short one; Chisnall\r\nRoad\'s the name."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," Dorrington responded patiently. "There might be something\r\nin that."\r\n\r\nBy this time Gillett\'s arm was in a starched bandage and secured by\r\nsplints, and a cab was ready to take him home. Mr. Mallows took Stedman\r\naway with him, expressing a desire to talk business, and Dorrington\r\nwent home by himself. He did not turn down Chisnall Road. But he\r\nwalked jauntily along toward the nearest cab-stand, and once or twice\r\nhe chuckled, for he saw his way to a delightfully lucrative financial\r\noperation in cycle companies, without risk of capital.\r\n\r\nThe cab gained, he called at the lodgings of two of his men assistants\r\nand gave them instant instructions. Then he packed a small bag at his\r\nrooms in Conduit Street, and at midnight was in the late fast train for\r\nBirmingham.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe prospectus of the "Avalanche Bicycle and Tyre Company" stated\r\nthat the works were at Exeter and Birmingham. Exeter is a delightful\r\nold town, but it can scarcely be regarded as the centre of the cycle\r\ntrade; neither is it in especially easy and short communication with\r\nBirmingham. It was the sort of thing that any critic anxious to pick\r\nholes in the prospectus might wonder at, and so one of Dorrington\'s\r\nassistants had gone by the night mail to inspect the works. It was from\r\nthis man that Dorrington, in Birmingham, about noon on the day after\r\nGillett\'s disaster, received this telegram--\r\n\r\n    _Works here old disused cloth-mills just out of town. Closed and\r\n    empty but with big new signboard and notice that works now running\r\n    are at Birmingham. Agent says only deposit paid--tenancy agreement\r\n    not signed.--Farrish._\r\n\r\nThe telegram increased Dorrington\'s satisfaction, for he had just\r\ntaken a look at the Birmingham works. They were not empty, though\r\nnearly so, nor were they large; and a man there had told him that the\r\nchief premises, where most of the work was done, were at Exeter. And\r\nthe hollower the business the better prize he saw in store for himself.\r\nHe had already, early in the morning, indulged in a telegram on his own\r\naccount, though he had not signed it. This was how it ran--\r\n\r\n  _Mallows, 58, Upper Sandown Place,\r\n  London, W._\r\n\r\n    _Fear all not safe here. Run down by 10.10 train without fail._\r\n\r\nThus it happened that at a little later than half-past eight\r\nDorrington\'s other assistant, watching the door of No. 58, Upper\r\nSandown Place, saw a telegram delivered, and immediately afterward\r\nMr. Paul Mallows in much haste dashed away in a cab which was called\r\nfrom the end of the street. The assistant followed in another. Mr.\r\nMallows dismissed his cab at a theatrical wig-maker\'s in Bow Street\r\nand entered. When he emerged in little more than forty minutes\' time,\r\nnone but a practised watcher, who had guessed the reason of the visit,\r\nwould have recognised him. He had not assumed the clumsy disguise of a\r\nfalse beard. He was "made up" deftly. His colour was heightened, and\r\nhis face seemed thinner. There was no heavy accession of false hair,\r\nbut a slight cr\xc3\xaape-hair whisker at each side made a better and less\r\npronounced disguise. He seemed a younger, healthier man. The watcher\r\nsaw him safely off to Birmingham by the ten minutes past ten train,\r\nand then gave Dorrington note by telegraph of the guise in which Mr.\r\nMallows was travelling.\r\n\r\nNow this train was timed to arrive at Birmingham at one, which was\r\nthe reason that Dorrington had named it in the anonymous telegram.\r\nThe entrance to the "Avalanche" works was by a large gate, which was\r\nclosed, but which was provided with a small door to pass a man. Within\r\nwas a yard, and at a little before one o\'clock Dorrington pushed open\r\nthe small door, peeped, and entered. Nobody was about in the yard, and\r\nwhat little noise could be heard came from a particular part of the\r\nbuilding on the right. A pile of solid "export" crates stood to the\r\nleft, and these Dorrington had noted at his previous call that morning\r\nas making a suitable hiding-place for temporary use. Now he slipped\r\nbehind them and awaited the stroke of one. Prompt at the hour a door on\r\nthe opposite side of the yard swung open, and two men and a boy emerged\r\nand climbed one after another through the little door in the big gate.\r\nThen presently another man, not a workman, but apparently a sort of\r\noverseer, came from the opposite door, which he carelessly let fall-to\r\nbehind him, and he also disappeared through the little door, which he\r\nthen locked. Dorrington was now alone in the sole active works of the\r\n"Avalanche Bicycle and Tyre Company, Limited."\r\n\r\nHe tried the door opposite and found it was free to open. Within he saw\r\nin a dark corner a candle which had been left burning, and opposite him\r\na large iron enamelling oven, like an immense safe, and round about, on\r\nbenches, were strewn heaps of the glaring red and gold transfer which\r\nDorrington had observed the day before on the machines exhibited in the\r\nHolborn Viaduct window. Some of the frames had the label newly applied,\r\nand others were still plain. It would seem that the chief business of\r\nthe "Avalanche Bicycle and Tyre Company, Limited," was the attaching\r\nof labels to previously nondescript machines. But there was little time\r\nto examine further, and indeed Dorrington presently heard the noise of\r\na key in the outer gate. So he stood and waited by the enamelling oven\r\nto welcome Mr. Mallows.\r\n\r\nAs the door was pushed open Dorrington advanced and bowed politely.\r\nMallows started guiltily, but, remembering his disguise, steadied\r\nhimself, and asked gruffly, "Well, sir, and who are you?"\r\n\r\n"I," answered Dorrington with perfect composure, "I am Mr.\r\nPaul Mallows--you may have heard of me in connection with the\r\n\'Indestructible Bicycle Company.\'"\r\n\r\nMallows was altogether taken aback. But then it struck him that perhaps\r\nthe detective, anxious to win the reward he had offered in the matter\r\nof the Gillett outrage, was here making inquiries in the assumed\r\ncharacter of the man who stood, impenetrably disguised, before him. So\r\nafter a pause he asked again, a little less gruffly, "And what may be\r\nyour business?"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Dorrington, "I did think of taking shares in this company.\r\nI suppose there would be no objection to the managing director of\r\nanother company taking shares in this?"\r\n\r\n"No," answered Mallows, wondering what all this was to lead to.\r\n\r\n"Of course not; I\'m sure _you_ don\'t think so, eh?" Dorrington, as\r\nhe spoke, looked in the other\'s face with a sly leer, and Mallows\r\nbegan to feel altogether uncomfortable. "But there\'s one other\r\nthing," Dorrington pursued, taking out his pocket-book, though still\r\nmaintaining his leer in Mallows\'s face--"one other thing. And by the\r\nway, _will_ you have another piece of court plaster now I\'ve got\r\nit out? Don\'t say no. It\'s a pleasure to oblige you, really." And\r\nDorrington, his leer growing positively fiendish, tapped the side of\r\nhis nose with the case of court plaster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "TAPPED THE SIDE OF HIS NOSE WITH THE CASE."]\r\n\r\nMallows paled under the paint, gasped, and felt for support. Dorrington\r\nlaughed pleasantly. "Come, come," he said, "don\'t be frightened. I\r\nadmire your cleverness, Mr. Mallows, and I shall arrange everything\r\npleasantly, as you will see. And as to the court plaster, if you\'d\r\nrather not have it you needn\'t. You have another piece on now, I see.\r\nWhy didn\'t you get them to paint it over at Clarkson\'s? They really did\r\nthe face very well, though! And there again you were quite right.\r\nSuch a man as yourself was likely to be recognised in such a place as\r\nBirmingham, and that would have been unfortunate for both of us--_both_\r\nof us, I assure you.... Man alive, don\'t look as though I was going to\r\ncut your throat! I\'m not, I assure you. You\'re a smart man of business,\r\nand I happen to have spotted a little operation of yours, that\'s all.\r\nI shall arrange easy terms for you.... Pull yourself together and talk\r\nbusiness before the men come back. Here, sit on this bench."\r\n\r\nMallows, staring amazedly in Dorrington\'s face, suffered himself to be\r\nled to a bench, and sat on it.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Dorrington, "the first thing is a little matter of a\r\nhundred pounds. That was the reward you promised if I should discover\r\nwho broke Gillett\'s arm last night. Well, I _have_. Do you happen to\r\nhave any notes with you? If not, make it a cheque."\r\n\r\n"But--but--how--I mean who--who----"\r\n\r\n"Tut, tut! Don\'t waste time, Mr. Mallows. _Who?_ Why, yourself, of\r\ncourse. I knew all about it before I left you last night, though it\r\nwasn\'t quite convenient to claim the reward then, for reasons you\'ll\r\nunderstand presently. Come, that little hundred!"\r\n\r\n"But what--what proof have you? I\'m not to be bounced like this, you\r\nknow." Mr. Mallows was gathering his faculties again.\r\n\r\n"Proof? Why, man alive, be reasonable! Suppose I have none--none at\r\nall? What difference does that make? Am I to walk out and tell your\r\nfellow directors where I have met you--here--or am I to have that\r\nhundred? More, am I to publish abroad that Mr. Paul Mallows is the\r\nmoving spirit in the rotten \'Avalanche Bicycle Company\'?"\r\n\r\n"Well," Mallows answered reluctantly, "if you put it like that----"\r\n\r\n"But I only put it like that to make you see things reasonably. As a\r\nmatter of fact your connection with this new company is enough to bring\r\nyour little performance with the iron chair pretty near proof. But I\r\ngot at it from the other side. See here--you\'re much too clumsy with\r\nyour fingers, Mr. Mallows. First you go and tear the tip of your middle\r\nfinger opening your brougham door, and have to get court plaster from\r\nme. Then you let that court plaster get frayed at the edge, and you\r\nstill keep it on. After that you execute your very successful chair\r\noperation. When the eyes of the others are following the bicycles you\r\ntake the chair in the hand with the plaster on it, catching hold of it\r\nat the place where a rough, loose, square nut protrudes, and you pitch\r\nit on to the track so clumsily and nervously that the nut carries away\r\nthe frayed thread of the court plaster with it. Here it is, you see,\r\nstill in my pocket-book, where I put it last night by the light of the\r\nlantern; just a sticky black silk thread, that\'s all. I\'ve only brought\r\nit to show you I\'m playing a fair game with you. Of course I might\r\neasily have got a witness before I took the thread off the nut, if I\r\nhad thought you were likely to fight the matter. But I knew you were\r\nnot. You can\'t fight, you know, with this bogus company business known\r\nto me. So that I am only showing you this thread as an act of grace,\r\nto prove that I have stumped you with perfect fairness. And now the\r\nhundred. Here\'s a fountain pen, if you want one."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Mallows glumly, "I suppose I must, then." He took the\r\npen and wrote the cheque. Dorrington blotted it on the pad of his\r\npocket-book and folded it away.\r\n\r\n"So much for that!" he said. "That\'s just a little preliminary, you\r\nunderstand. We\'ve done these little things just as a guarantee of good\r\nfaith--not necessarily for publication, though you must remember that\r\nas yet there\'s nothing to prevent it. I\'ve done you a turn by finding\r\nout who upset those bicycles, as you so ardently wished me to do last\r\nnight, and you\'ve loyally fulfilled your part of the contract by paying\r\nthe promised reward--though I must say that you haven\'t paid with all\r\nthe delight and pleasure you spoke of at the time. But I\'ll forgive you\r\nthat, and now that the little _hors d\'oeuvre_ is disposed of, we\'ll\r\nproceed to serious business."\r\n\r\nMallows looked uncomfortably glum.\r\n\r\n"But you mustn\'t look so ashamed of yourself, you know," Dorrington\r\nsaid, purposely misinterpreting his glumness. "It\'s all business.\r\nYou were disposed for a little side flutter, so to speak--a little\r\nspeculation outside your regular business. Well, you mustn\'t be ashamed\r\nof that."\r\n\r\n"No," Mallows observed, assuming something of his ordinarily ponderous\r\nmanner; "no, of course not. It\'s a little speculative deal. Everybody\r\ndoes it, and there\'s a deal of money going."\r\n\r\n"Precisely. And since everybody does it, and there is so much money\r\ngoing, you are only making your share."\r\n\r\n"Of course." Mr. Mallows was almost pompous by now.\r\n\r\n"_Of_ course." Dorrington coughed slightly. "Well now, do you know,\r\nI am exactly the same sort of man as yourself--if you don\'t mind the\r\ncomparison. _I_ am disposed for a little side flutter, so to speak--a\r\nlittle speculation outside my regular business. I also am not ashamed\r\nof it. And since everybody does it, and there is so much money\r\ngoing--why, _I_ am thinking of making _my_ share. So we are evidently a\r\npair, and naturally intended for each other!"\r\n\r\nMr. Paul Mallows here looked a little doubtful.\r\n\r\n"See here, now," Dorrington proceeded. "I have lately taken it into\r\nmy head to operate a little on the cycle share market. That was why I\r\ncame round myself about that little spoke affair, instead of sending an\r\nassistant. I wanted to know somebody who understood the cycle trade,\r\nfrom whom I might get tips. You see I\'m perfectly frank with you. Well,\r\nI have succeeded uncommonly well. And I want you to understand that\r\nI have gone every step of the way by fair work. I took nothing for\r\ngranted, and I played the game fairly. When you asked me (as you had\r\nanxious reason to ask) if I had found anything, I told you there was\r\nnothing very big--and see what a little thing the thread was! Before I\r\ncame away from the pavilion I made sure that you were really the only\r\nman there with black court plaster on his fingers. I had noticed the\r\nhands of every man but two, and I made an excuse of borrowing something\r\nto see those. I saw your thin pretence of suspecting the betting men,\r\nand I played up to it. I have had a telegraphic report on your Exeter\r\nworks this morning--a deserted cloth mills with nothing on it of yours\r\nbut a signboard, and only a deposit of rent paid. _There_ they referred\r\nto the works here. _Here_ they referred to the works there. It was very\r\nclever, really! Also I have had a telegraphic report of your make-up\r\nadventure this morning. Clarkson does it marvellously, doesn\'t he? And,\r\nby the way, that telegram bringing you down to Birmingham was not from\r\nyour confederate here, as perhaps you fancied. It was from me. Thanks\r\nfor coming so promptly. I managed to get a quiet look round here just\r\nbefore you arrived, and on the whole the conclusion I come to as to\r\nthe \'Avalanche Bicycle and Tyre Company, Limited,\' is this: A clever\r\nman, whom it gives me great pleasure to know," with a bow to Mallows,\r\n"conceives the notion of offering the public the very rottenest cycle\r\ncompany ever planned, and all without appearing in it himself. He finds\r\nwhat little capital is required; his two or three confederates help to\r\nmake up a board of directors, with one or two titled guinea-pigs, who\r\nknow nothing of the company and care nothing, and the rest\'s easy. A\r\nprofessional racing man is employed to win races and make records, on\r\nmachines which have been specially made by another firm (perhaps it was\r\nthe \'Indestructible,\' who knows?) to a private order, and afterwards\r\ndecorated with the name and style of the bogus company on a transfer.\r\nFor ordinary sale, bicycles of the \'trade\' description are bought--so\r\nmuch a hundred from the factors, and put your own name on \'em. They\r\ncome cheap, and they sell at a good price--the profit pays all expenses\r\nand perhaps a bit over; and by the time they all break down the company\r\nwill be successfully floated, the money--the capital--will be divided,\r\nthe moving spirit and his confederates will have disappeared, and the\r\nguinea-pigs will be left to stand the racket--if there is a racket. And\r\nthe moving spirit will remain unsuspected, a man of account in the\r\ntrade all the time! Admirable! All the work to be done at the \'works\'\r\nis the sticking on of labels and a bit of enamelling. Excellent, all\r\nround! Isn\'t that about the size of your operations?"\r\n\r\n"Well, yes," Mallows answered, a little reluctantly, but with something\r\nof modest pride in his manner, "that was the notion, since you speak so\r\nplainly."\r\n\r\n"And it shall be the notion. All--everything--shall be as you have\r\nplanned it, with one exception, which is this. The moving spirit shall\r\ndivide his plunder with me."\r\n\r\n"_You?_ But--but--why, I gave you a hundred just now!"\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear! Why will you harp so much on that vulgar little hundred?\r\nThat\'s settled and done with. That\'s our little personal bargain in the\r\nmatter of the lamentable accident with the chair. We are now talking\r\nof bigger business--not hundreds, but thousands, and not one of them,\r\nbut a lot. Come now, a mind like yours should be wide enough to admit\r\nof a broad and large view of things. If I refrain from exposing this\r\ncharming scheme of yours I shall be promoting a piece of scandalous\r\nrobbery. Very well then, I want my promotion money, in the regular\r\nway. Can I shut my eyes and allow a piece of iniquity like this to go\r\non unchecked, without getting anything by way of damages for myself?\r\nPerish the thought! When all expenses are paid, and the confederates\r\nare sent off with as little as they will take, you and I will divide\r\nfairly, Mr. Mallows, respectable brothers in rascality. Mind, I might\r\nsay we\'d divide to begin with, and leave you to pay expenses, but I am\r\nalways fair to a partner in anything of this sort. I shall just want a\r\nlittle guarantee, you know--it\'s safest in such matters as these; say\r\na bill at six months for ten thousand pounds--which is very low. When\r\na satisfactory division is made you shall have the bill back. Come--I\r\nhave a bill-stamp ready, being so much convinced of your reasonableness\r\nas to buy it this morning, though it cost five pounds."\r\n\r\n"But that\'s nonsense--you\'re trying to impose. I\'ll give you anything\r\nreasonable--half is out of the question. What, after all the trouble\r\nand worry and risk that I\'ve had----"\r\n\r\n"Which would suffice for no more than to put you in gaol if I held up\r\nmy finger!"\r\n\r\n"But hang it, be reasonable! You\'re a mighty clever man, and you\'ve\r\ngot me on the hip, as I admit. Say ten per cent."\r\n\r\n"You\'re wasting time, and presently the men will be back. Your choice\r\nis between making half, or making none, and going to gaol into the\r\nbargain. Choose!"\r\n\r\n"But just consider----"\r\n\r\n"Choose!"\r\n\r\nMallows looked despairingly about him. "But really," he said, "I want\r\nthe money more than you think. I----"\r\n\r\n"For the last time--choose!"\r\n\r\nMallows\'s despairing gaze stopped at the enamelling oven. "Well, well,"\r\nhe said, "if I must, I must, I suppose. But I warn you, you may regret\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear no, I\'m not so pessimistic. Come, you wrote a cheque--now I\'ll\r\nwrite the bill. \'Six months after date, pay to me or my order the sum\r\nof ten thousand pounds for value received\'--excellent value too, _I_\r\nthink. There you are!"\r\n\r\nWhen the bill was written and signed, Mallows scribbled his acceptance\r\nwith more readiness than might have been expected. Then he rose, and\r\nsaid with something of brisk cheerfulness in his tone, "Well, that\'s\r\ndone, and the least said the soonest mended. You\'ve won it, and I\r\nwon\'t grumble any more. I think I\'ve done this thing pretty neatly, eh?\r\nCome and see the \'works.\'"\r\n\r\nEvery other part of the place was empty of machinery. There were a good\r\nmany finished frames and wheels, bought separately, and now in course\r\nof being fitted together for sale; and there were many more complete\r\nbicycles of cheap but showy make to which nothing needed to be done but\r\nto fix the red and gold "transfer" of the "Avalanche" company. Then\r\nMallows opened the tall iron door of the enamelling oven.\r\n\r\n"See this," he said; "this is the enamelling oven. Get in and look\r\nround. The frames and other different parts hang on the racks after the\r\nenamel is laid on, and all those gas jets are lighted to harden it by\r\nheat. Do you see that deeper part there by the back?--go closer."\r\n\r\nDorrington felt a push at his back and the door was swung to with a\r\nbang, and the latch dropped. He was in the dark, trapped in a great\r\niron chamber. "I warned you," shouted Mallows from without; "I warned\r\nyou you might regret it!" And instantly Dorrington\'s nostrils were\r\nfilled with the smell of escaping gas. He realised his peril on the\r\ninstant. Mallows had given him the bill with the idea of silencing\r\nhim by murder and recovering it. He had pushed him into the oven\r\nand had turned on the gas. It was dark, but to light a match would\r\nmean death instantly, and without the match it must be death by\r\nsuffocation and poison of gas in a very few minutes. To appeal to\r\nMallows was useless--Dorrington knew too much. It would seem that at\r\nlast a horribly-fitting retribution had overtaken Dorrington in death\r\nby a mode parallel to that which he and his creatures had prepared\r\nfor others. Dorrington\'s victims had drowned in water--or at least\r\nCrofton\'s had, for I never ascertained definitely whether anybody had\r\nmet his death by the tank after the Croftons had taken service with\r\nDorrington--and now Dorrington himself was to drown in gas. The oven\r\nwas of sheet iron, fastened by a latch in the centre. Dorrington flung\r\nhimself desperately against the door, and it gave outwardly at the\r\nextreme bottom. He snatched a loose angle-iron with which his hand\r\ncame in contact, dashed against the door once more, and thrust the\r\niron through where it strained open. Then, with another tremendous\r\nplunge, he drove the door a little more outward and raised the\r\nangle-iron in the crack; then once more, and raised it again. He was\r\nnear to losing his senses, when, with one more plunge, the catch of the\r\nlatch, not designed for such treatment, suddenly gave way, the door\r\nflew open, and Dorrington, blue in the face, staring, stumbling and\r\ngasping, came staggering out into the fresher air, followed by a gush\r\nof gas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "HAULED THE STRUGGLING WRETCH ACROSS THE ROOM."]\r\n\r\nMallows had retreated to the rooms behind, and thither Dorrington\r\nfollowed him, gaining vigour and fury at every step. At sight of him\r\nthe wretched Mallows sank in a corner, sighing and shivering with\r\nterror. Dorrington reached him and clutched him by the collar. There\r\nshould be no more honour between these two thieves now. He would drag\r\nMallows forth and proclaim him aloud; and he would keep that \xc2\xa310,000\r\nbill. He hauled the struggling wretch across the room, tearing off\r\nthe cr\xc3\xaape whiskers as he came, while Mallows supplicated and whined,\r\nfearing that it might be the other\'s design to imprison _him_ in the\r\nenamelling oven. But at the door of the room against that containing\r\nthe oven their progress came to an end, for the escaped gas had\r\nreached the lighted candle, and with one loud report the partition wall\r\nfell in, half burying Mallows where he lay, and knocking Dorrington\r\nover.\r\n\r\nWindows fell out of the building, and men broke through the front\r\ngate, climbed into the ruined rooms and stopped the still escaping\r\ngas. When the two men and the boy returned, with the conspirator who\r\nhad been in charge of the works, they found a crowd from the hardware\r\nand cycle factories thereabout, surveying with great interest the\r\nspectacle of the extrication of Mr. Paul Mallows, managing director of\r\nthe "Indestructible Bicycle Company," from the broken bricks, mortar,\r\nbicycles and transfers of the "Avalanche Bicycle and Tyre Company,\r\nLimited," and the preparations for carrying him to a surgeon\'s where\r\nhis broken leg might be set. As for Dorrington, a crushed hat and a\r\ntorn coat were all his hurts, beyond a few scratches. And in a couple\r\nof hours it was all over Birmingham, and spreading to other places,\r\nthat the business of the "Avalanche Bicycle and Tyre Company" consisted\r\nof sticking brilliant labels on factors\' bicycles, bought in batches;\r\nfor the whole thing was thrown open to the general gaze by the\r\nexplosion. So that when, next day, Lant won the fifty miles race in\r\nLondon, he was greeted with ironical shouts of "Gum on yer transfer!"\r\n"Hi! mind yer label!" "Where did you steal that bicycle?" "Sold yer\r\nshares?" and so forth.\r\n\r\nSomehow the "Avalanche Bicycle and Tyre Company, Limited," never went\r\nto allotment. It was said that a few people in remote and benighted\r\nspots, where news never came till it was in the history books, had\r\napplied for shares, but the bankers returned their money, doubtless\r\nto their extreme disappointment. It was found politic, also, that Mr.\r\nPaul Mallows should retire from the directorate of the "Indestructible\r\nBicycle Company"--a concern which is still, I believe, flourishing\r\nexceedingly.\r\n\r\nAs for Dorrington, he had his hundred pounds reward. But the bill for\r\n\xc2\xa310,000 he never presented. Why, I do not altogether know, unless he\r\nfound that Mr. Mallows\'s financial position, as he had hinted, was not\r\naltogether so good as was supposed. At any rate, it was found among the\r\nnotes and telegrams in this case in the Dorrington deed-box.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE CASE OF MR. LOFTUS DEACON_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe Case of Mr. Loftus Deacon\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThis was a case that helped to give Dorrington much of that reputation\r\nwhich unfortunately too often enabled him to profit himself far beyond\r\nthe extent to which his clients intended. It occurred some few years\r\nback, and there was such a stir at the time over the mysterious death\r\nof Mr. Loftus Deacon that it well paid Dorrington to use his utmost\r\ndiligence in an honest effort to uncover the mystery. It gave him\r\none of his best advertisements, though indeed it occasioned him less\r\ntrouble in the unravelling than many a less interesting case. There\r\nwere scarcely any memoranda of the affair among Dorrington\'s papers,\r\nbeyond entries of fees paid, and I have almost entirely relied upon\r\nthe account given me by Mr. Stone, manager in the employ of the firm\r\nowning the premises in which Mr. Deacon died.\r\n\r\nThese premises consisted of a large building let out in expensive\r\nflats, one of the first places built with that design in the West-End\r\nof London. The building was one of three, all belonging to the firm I\r\nhave mentioned, and numbered 1, 2 and 3, Bedford Mansions. They stood\r\nin the St. James\'s district, and Mr. Loftus Deacon\'s quarters were in\r\nNo. 2.\r\n\r\nMr. Deacon\'s magnificent collection of oriental porcelain will be\r\nremembered as long as any in the national depositories; much of it was\r\nfor a long while lent, and, by Mr. Deacon\'s will, passed permanently\r\ninto possession of the nation. His collection of oriental arms,\r\nhowever, was broken up and sold, as were also his other innumerable\r\nobjects of Eastern art--lacquers, carvings, and so forth. He was a\r\nwealthy man, this Mr. Deacon, a bachelor of sixty, and his whole life\r\nwas given to his collections. He was currently reported to spend some\r\n\xc2\xa315,000 a year on them, and, in addition, would make inroads into\r\ncapital for special purchases at the great sales. People wondered\r\nwhere all the things were kept. And indeed they had reason, for\r\nMr. Deacon\'s personal establishment was but a suite of rooms on the\r\nground floor of Bedford Mansions. But the bulk of the collections were\r\nhoused at various museums--indeed it was a matter of banter among his\r\nacquaintances that Mr. Loftus Deacon made the taxpayers warehouse most\r\nof his things; moreover, the flat was a large one--it occupied almost\r\nthe whole of the ground-floor of the building, and it overflowed with\r\nthe choicest of its tenant\'s possessions. There were eight large and\r\nlofty rooms, as well as the lobby, scullery and so forth, and every\r\none was full. The walls were hung with the most precious _kakemono_\r\nand _nishikiy\xc3\xa9_ of Japan; and glass cabinets stood everywhere, packed\r\nwith porcelain and faience--celadon, peach-bloom, and blue and white,\r\nSatsuma, Raku, Ninsei, and Arita--many a small piece worth its weight\r\nin gold over and over and over again. At places on the wall, among\r\nthe _kakemono_ and pictures of the _ukioy\xc3\xa9_, were trophies of arms.\r\nTwo suits of ancient Japanese armour, each complete and each the\r\nproduction of one of the most eminent of the Miochin family, were\r\nexhibited on stands, and swords stood in many corners and lay in\r\nmany racks. Innumerable drawers contained specimens of the greatest\r\nlacquer ware of Korin, Shunsho, Kajikawa, Koyetsu, and Ritsuo, each\r\nin its wadded brocade _fukusa_ with the light wooden box encasing\r\nall. In more glass cabinets stood _netsuk\xc3\xa9_ and _okimono_ of ivory,\r\nbronze, wood, and lacquer. There were a few gods and goddesses, and\r\nconspicuous among them two life-sized gilt Buddhas beamed mildly over\r\nall from the shelves on which they were raised. By the operation of\r\nnatural selection it came about that the choicest of all Mr. Deacon\'s\r\npossessions were collected in these rooms. Here were none of the great\r\ncumbersome pots, good in their way, but made of old time merely for the\r\nEuropean market. Of all that was Japanese every piece was of the best\r\nand rarest, consequently, in almost every case, of small dimensions, as\r\nis the way of the greatest of the wares of old Japan. And of all the\r\nprecious contents of these rooms everything was oriental in its origin\r\nexcept the contents of one case, which displayed specimens of the most\r\nmagnificent goldsmiths\' and silver-smiths\' work of medi\xc3\xa6val Europe. It\r\nstood in the room which Mr. Loftus Deacon used as his sitting-room, and\r\nmore than one of his visitors had wondered that such valuable property\r\nwas not kept at a banker\'s. This view, however, always surprised and\r\nirritated Mr. Deacon. "Keep it at a banker\'s?" he would say. "Why not\r\nmelt it down at once? The things are works of art, things of beauty,\r\nand that\'s why I have them, not merely because they\'re gold and silver.\r\nTo shut them up in a strong-room would be the next thing to destroying\r\nthem altogether. Why not lock the whole of my collections in safes, and\r\nnever look at them? They are all valuable. But if they are not to be\r\nseen I would rather have the money they cost." So the gold and silver\r\nstood in its case, to the blinking wonderment of messengers and porters\r\nwhose errands took them into Mr. Loftus Deacon\'s sitting-room. The\r\ncontents of this case were the only occasion, however, of Mr. Deacon\'s\r\nstraying from oriental paths in building up his collection. There they\r\nstood, but he made no attempt to add to them. He went about his daily\r\nhunting, bargaining, cataloguing, cleaning, and exhibiting to friends,\r\nbut all his new treasures were from the East, and most were Japanese.\r\nHis chief visitors were travelling buyers of curiosities; little\r\nJapanese who had come to England to study medicine and were paying\r\ntheir terms by the sale of heirlooms in pottery and lacquer; porters\r\nfrom Christie\'s and Foster\'s; and sometimes men from Copleston\'s--the\r\nodd emporium by the riverside where lions and monkeys, porcelain and\r\nsavage weapons were bought and sold close by the ships that brought\r\nthem home. The travellers were suspicious and cunning; the Japanese\r\nwere bright, polite, and dignified, and the men from Copleston\'s were\r\nwiry, hairy and amphibious; one was an enormously muscular little\r\nhunchback nicknamed Slackjaw--a quaint and rather repulsive compound of\r\nshowman, sailor and half-caste rough; and all were like mermen, more\r\nor less. These curious people came and went, and Mr. Deacon went on\r\nbuying, cataloguing, and joying in his possessions. It was the happiest\r\npossible life for a lonely old man with his tastes and his means of\r\ngratifying them, and it went placidly on till one Wednesday mid-day.\r\nThen Mr. Deacon was found dead in his rooms in most extraordinary and,\r\nit seemed, altogether unaccountable circumstances.\r\n\r\nThere was but one door leading into Mr. Deacon\'s rooms from the open\r\ncorridor of the building, and this was immediately opposite the large\r\nstreet door. When one entered from the street one ascended three or\r\nfour broad marble steps, pushed open one of a pair of glazed swing\r\ndoors and found oneself facing the door by which Mr. Deacon entered\r\nand left his quarters. There had originally been other doors into\r\nthe corridor from some of the rooms, but those Mr. Deacon had had\r\nblocked up, so making the flat entirely self-contained. Just by the\r\nglazed swing doors which I have spoken of, and in full view of the\r\nold gentleman\'s door, the hall-porter\'s box stood. It was glazed on\r\nall sides, and the porter sat so that Mr. Deacon\'s door was always\r\nbefore his eyes, and, so long as he was there, it was very unlikely\r\nthat anybody or anything could leave or enter by that door unobserved\r\nby him. It is important to remember this, in view of what happened on\r\nthe occasion I am writing of. There was one other exterior door to Mr.\r\nDeacon\'s flat, and one only. It gave upon the back spiral staircase,\r\nand was usually kept locked. This staircase had no outlet to the\r\ncorridors, but merely extended from the housekeeper\'s rooms at the top\r\nof the building to the basement. It was little used, and then only by\r\nservants, for it gave access only to the rooms on its own side. There\r\nwas no way from this staircase to the outer street except through the\r\nprivate rooms of the tenants, or through those of the housekeeper.\r\n\r\nThat Wednesday morning things had happened precisely in the ordinary\r\nway. Mr. Deacon had risen and breakfasted as usual. He was alone, with\r\nhis newspaper and his morning letters, when his breakfast was taken\r\nin and when it was removed. He had remained in his rooms till between\r\ntwelve and one o\'clock. Goods had arrived for him (this was an almost\r\ndaily occurrence), and one or two ordinary visitors had called and\r\ngone away again. It was Mr. Deacon\'s habit to lunch at his club, and\r\nat about a quarter to one, or thereabout, he had come out, locked his\r\ndoor, and leaving his usual message that he should be at the club for\r\nan hour or two, in case anybody called, he had left the building. At\r\nabout one, however, he had returned hurriedly, having forgotten some\r\nletters. "I didn\'t give you any letters for the post, did I, Beard,\r\nbefore I went out?" he asked the porter. And the porter replied that he\r\nhad not. Mr. Deacon thereupon crossed the corridor, entered his door,\r\nand shut it behind him.\r\n\r\nHe had been gone but a few seconds, when there arose an outcry from\r\nwithin the rooms--a shout followed in a breath by a loud cry of pain,\r\nand then silence. Beard, the porter, ran to the door and knocked, but\r\nthere was no reply. "Did you call, sir?" he shouted, and knocked again,\r\nbut still without response. The door was shut, and it had a latch lock\r\nwith no exterior handle. Beard, who had had an uncle die of apoplexy,\r\nwas now thoroughly alarmed, and shouted up the speaking-tube for the\r\nhousekeeper\'s keys. In course of a few minutes they were brought, and\r\nBeard and the housekeeper entered.\r\n\r\nThe lobby was as usual, and the sitting-room was in perfect order. But\r\nin the room beyond Mr. Loftus Deacon lay in a pool of blood, with two\r\nlarge and fearful gashes in his head. Not a soul was in any of the\r\nrooms, though the two men, first shutting the outer door, searched\r\ndiligently. All windows and doors were shut, and the rooms were\r\ntenantless and undisturbed, except that on the floor lay Mr. Deacon\r\nin his blood at the foot of a pedestal whereupon there squatted, with\r\nserenely fierce grin, the god Hachiman, gilt and painted, carrying in\r\none of his four hands a snake, in another a mace, in a third a small\r\nhuman figure, and in the fourth a heavy, straight, guardless sword; and\r\nall around furniture, cabinets, porcelain, lacquer and everything else\r\nlay undisturbed.\r\n\r\nAt first sight of the tragedy the porter had sent the lift-man for\r\nthe police, and soon they arrived, and a surgeon with them. For the\r\nsurgeon there was very little to do. Mr. Deacon was dead. Either of the\r\ntwo frightful gashes in the head would have been fatal, and they had\r\nobviously both been delivered with the same instrument--something heavy\r\nand exceedingly sharp.\r\n\r\nThe police now set themselves to close investigation. The porter was\r\ncertain that nobody had entered the rooms that morning who had not\r\nafterwards left. He was sure that nobody had entered unobserved, and\r\nhe was sure that Mr. Deacon had re-entered his chambers unaccompanied.\r\nWorking, therefore, on the assumption that the murderer could not\r\nhave entered by the front door, the police turned their attention\r\nto the back door and the windows. The door to the back staircase\r\nwas locked, and the key was in the lock and inside. Therefore they\r\nconsidered the windows. There were but three of these that looked upon\r\nthe street, two in one room and one in another, but these were shut\r\nand fastened within. Other rooms were lighted by windows looking upon\r\nlighting-wells, some being supplied with reflectors. All these windows\r\nwere found to be quite undisturbed, and fastened within, except one.\r\nThis window was in the bedroom, and, though it was shut, the catch was\r\nnot fastened. The porter declared that it was Mr. Deacon\'s practice\r\ninvariably to fasten every shut window, a thing he was always very\r\ncareful about. Moreover, the window now found unfastened and shut was\r\nalways left open a foot or so all day, to air the bedroom. More, a\r\nhousemaid was brought who had that morning made the bed and dusted the\r\nroom. The window was opened, she said, when she had entered the room,\r\nand she had left it so, as she always did. Therefore, shut as it was,\r\nbut not fastened, it seemed plain that this window must have given exit\r\nto the murderer, since no other way appeared possible. Also, to shut\r\nthe window behind him would be the fugitive\'s natural policy. The lower\r\npanes were of ground glass, and at least pursuit would be delayed.\r\n\r\nThe window looked upon a lighting-well, and the concreted floor of\r\nthe basement was but fifteen or twenty feet below. Careful inquiries\r\ndisclosed the fact that a man had been at work painting the joinery\r\nabout this well-bottom. He was a man of very indifferent character--had\r\nin fact "done time"--and he was employed for odd jobs by way of\r\ncharity, being some sort of connection of a member of the firm owning\r\nthe buildings. He had, indeed, received a good education, fitted to\r\nplace him in a very different position from that in which he now found\r\nhimself, but he was a black sheep. He drank, he gambled, and finally\r\nhe stole. His relatives helped him again and again, but their efforts\r\nwere useless, and now he was indebted to one of them for his present\r\noccupation at a pound a week. The police, of course, knew something of\r\nhim, and postponed questioning him directly until they had investigated\r\na little further. It might be that Mr. Deacon\'s death was the work of a\r\nconspiracy wherein more than one had participated.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe next morning (Thursday) Mr. Henry Colson was an early caller at\r\nDorrington\'s office. Mr. Colson was a thin, grizzled man of sixty or\r\nthereabout, who had been a close friend--the only intimate friend,\r\nindeed--of Mr. Loftus Deacon. He was a widower, and he lived in rooms\r\nscarce two hundred yards distant from Bedford Mansions, where his\r\nfriend had died.\r\n\r\n"My business, Mr. Dorrington," he said, "is in connection with the\r\nterrible death of my old friend Mr. Loftus Deacon, of which you no\r\ndoubt have heard or read in the morning papers."\r\n\r\n"Yes," Dorrington assented, "both in this morning\'s papers and the\r\nevening papers of yesterday."\r\n\r\n"Very good. I may tell you that I am sole executor under Mr. Deacon\'s\r\nwill. The will indeed is in my possession (I am a retired solicitor),\r\nand there happens to be a sum set apart in that will out of which I am\r\nto defray any expenses that may arise in connection with his death.\r\nIt really seems to me that I should be quite justified in using some\r\npart of that sum in paying for inquiries to be conducted by such\r\nan experienced man as yourself, into the cause of my poor friend\'s\r\ndeath. At any rate, I wish you to make such inquiries, even if I have\r\nto pay the fees myself. I am convinced that there is something very\r\nextraordinary--something very deep--in the tragedy. The police are\r\npottering about, of course, and keeping very mysterious as to the\r\nmatter, but I expect that\'s simply because they know nothing. They have\r\nmade no arrest, and perhaps every minute of delay is making the thing\r\nmore difficult. As executor, of course, I have access to the rooms. Can\r\nyou come and look at them now?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," Dorrington answered, reaching for his hat. "I suppose there\'s\r\nno doubt of the case being one of murder? Suicide is not likely, I take\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no--certainly not. He was scarcely the sort of man to commit\r\nsuicide, I should say. And he was as cheerful as he could be the\r\nafternoon before, when I last saw him. Besides, the surgeon says it\'s\r\nnothing of the kind. A man committing suicide doesn\'t gash himself\r\ntwice over the head, or even once. And in this case the first blow\r\nwould have made him incapable of another."\r\n\r\n"I have heard nothing about the weapon," Dorrington remarked, as they\r\nentered a cab. "Has it been found?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s a difficulty," Mr. Colson answered. "It would seem not. Of\r\ncourse there are numbers of weapons about the place--Japanese swords\r\nand what not--any one of which _might_ have caused such injuries. But\r\nthere are no bloodstains on any of them."\r\n\r\n"Is any article of value missing?"\r\n\r\n"I believe not. Everything seemed to be in its place, so far as I\r\nnoticed yesterday. But then I was not there long, and was too much\r\nagitated to notice very particularly. At any rate the old gold and\r\nsilver plate had not been disturbed. He kept that in a large case in\r\nhis sitting-room, and it would certainly be the plate that the murderer\r\nwould have made for first, if robbery had been his object."\r\n\r\nMr. Colson gave Dorrington the other details of the case, already set\r\nforth in this account, and presently the cab stopped before No. 2,\r\nBedford Mansions. The body, of course, had been removed, but otherwise\r\nthe rooms had not been disturbed. The porter let them into the chambers\r\nby aid of the housekeeper\'s key.\r\n\r\n"They don\'t seem to have found his keys," Mr. Colson explained, "and\r\nthat will be troublesome for me, I expect, presently. He usually\r\ncarried them with him, but they were not on the body when found."\r\n\r\n"That may be important," Dorrington said. "But let us look at the\r\nrooms."\r\n\r\nThey walked through the large apartments one after the other, and\r\nDorrington glanced casually about him as he went. Presently Mr. Colson\r\nstopped, struck with an idea. "Ah!" he said, more to himself than to\r\nDorrington. "I will just see."\r\n\r\nHe turned quickly back into the room they had just quitted, and made\r\nfor the broad shelf that ran the length of the wall at about the height\r\nof an ordinary table. "Yes!" he cried. "It is! It\'s gone!"\r\n\r\n"What is gone?"\r\n\r\n"The sword--the Masamun\xc3\xa9!"\r\n\r\nThe whole surface of the shelf, covered with a silk cloth, was occupied\r\nby Japanese swords and dirks with rich mountings. Most lay on their\r\nsides in rows, but two or three were placed in the lacquered racks.\r\nMr. Colson stood and pointed at a rack which was standing alone and\r\nswordless. "That is where it was," he said. "I saw it--was talking\r\nabout it, in fact--the afternoon before. No, it\'s nowhere about. It\'s\r\nnot like any of the others. Let me see." And Mr. Colson, much excited,\r\nhurried from room to room wherever swords were kept, searching for the\r\nmissing specimen.\r\n\r\n"No," he said at last, looking strangely startled; "It\'s gone. And I\r\nthink we are near the soul of the mystery." He spoke in hushed, uneasy\r\ntones, and his eyes gave token of strange apprehension.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" Dorrington asked. "What about this sword?"\r\n\r\n"Come into the sitting-room." Mr. Colson led Dorrington away from the\r\nscene of Mr. Deacon\'s end, away from the empty sword rack and from\r\nunder the shadow of the grinning god with its four arms, its snake,\r\nand its threatening sword. "I don\'t think I\'m very superstitious," Mr.\r\nColson proceeded, "but I really feel that I can talk more freely about\r\nthe matter in here."\r\n\r\nThey sat at the table, over against the case of plate, and Mr. Colson\r\nwent on. "The sword I speak of," he said, "was much prized by my\r\npoor friend, who brought it with him from Japan nearly twenty years\r\nback--not many years after the civil war there, in fact. It was a very\r\nancient specimen--of the fourteenth century, I think--and the work of\r\nthe famous swordsmith Masamun\xc3\xa9. Masamun\xc3\xa9\'s work is very rarely met\r\nwith, it seems, and Mr. Deacon felt himself especially fortunate\r\nin securing this example. It is the only piece of Masamun\xc3\xa9\'s work\r\nin the collection. I may tell you that a sword by one of the great\r\nold masters is one of the rarest of all the rarities that come from\r\nJapan. The possessors of the best keep them rather than sell them at\r\nany price. Such swords were handed down from father to son for many\r\ngenerations, and a Japanese of the old school would have been disgraced\r\nhad he parted with his father\'s blade even under the most pressing\r\nnecessity. The mounts he might possibly sell, if he were in very bad\r\ncircumstances, but the blade never. Of course, such a thing _has_\r\noccurred--and it occurred in this very case, as you shall hear. But\r\nas an almost invariable rule the Japanese _samurai_ would part with\r\nhis life by starvation rather than with his father\'s sword by sale.\r\nSuch swords would never be stolen, either, for there was a firm belief\r\nthat a faithful spirit resided in each, which would bring terrible\r\ndisaster on any wrongful possessor. Each sword had its own name, just\r\nas the legendary sword of King Arthur had, and a man\'s social standing\r\nwas judged, not by his house nor by his dress, but by the two swords\r\nin his girdle. The ancient sword-smiths wore court dress and made\r\nvotive offerings when they forged their best blades, and the gods were\r\nsupposed to assist and to watch over the career of the weapon. Thus you\r\nwill understand that such an article was apt to become an object almost\r\nof worship among the _samurai_ or warrior-class in Old Japan. And now\r\nto come to the sword in question. It was a long sword or _katana_ (the\r\nswords, as you know, were worn in pairs, and the smaller was called\r\nthe _wakizashi_), and it was mounted very handsomely with fittings by\r\na great metal worker of the Goto family. The signature of the great\r\nMasamun\xc3\xa9 himself was engraved in the usual place--on the iron tang\r\nwithin the hilt. Mr. Deacon bought the weapon of its possessor, a man\r\nof some distinction before the overthrow of the Shogun in 1868, but\r\nwho was reduced to deep poverty by the change in affairs. Mr. Deacon\r\ncame across him in his direst straits, when his children were near to\r\nstarvation, and the man sold the sword for a sum that was a little\r\nfortune to him, though it only represented some four or five pounds of\r\nour money. Mr. Deacon was always very proud of his treasure--indeed\r\nit was said to be the only blade by Masamun\xc3\xa9 in Europe; and the two\r\nJapanese things that he had always most longed for, I have heard him\r\nsay, were a Masamun\xc3\xa9 sword and a piece of violet lacquer--that precious\r\nlacquer the secret of making which died long ago. The Masamun\xc3\xa9 he\r\nacquired, as I have been telling you, but the violet lacquer he never\r\nonce encountered.\r\n\r\n"Six months or so back, Deacon received a visit from a Japanese--taller\r\nthan usual for a Japanese (I have seen him myself) and with the refined\r\ntype of face characteristic of some of the higher class of his country.\r\nHis name was Keigo Kanamaro, his card said, and he introduced himself\r\nas the son of Keigo Kiyotaki, the man who had sold Deacon his sword.\r\nHe had come to England and had found my friend after much inquiry, he\r\nsaid, expressly to take back his father\'s _katana_. His father was\r\ndead, and he desired to place the sword in his tomb, that the soul of\r\nthe old man might rest in peace, undisturbed by the disgrace that had\r\nfallen upon him by the sale of the sword that had been his and his\r\nancestors\' for hundreds of years back. The father had vowed when he had\r\nreceived the sword in his turn from Kanamaro\'s grandfather, never to\r\npart with it, but had broken his vow under pressure of want. He (the\r\nson) had earned money as a merchant (an immeasurable descent for a\r\n_samurai_ with the feelings of the old school), and he was prepared to\r\nbuy back the Masamun\xc3\xa9 blade with the Goto mountings for a much higher\r\nprice than his father had received for it."\r\n\r\n"And I suppose Deacon wouldn\'t sell it?" Dorrington asked.\r\n\r\n"No," Mr. Colson replied. "He wouldn\'t have sold it at any price, I\'m\r\nsure. Well, Kanamaro pressed him very urgently, and called again and\r\nagain. He was very gentlemanly and very dignified, but he was very\r\nearnest. He apologised for making a commercial offer, assured Deacon\r\nthat he was quite aware that he was no mere buyer and seller, but\r\npleaded the urgency of his case. \'It is not here as in Japan,\' he\r\nsaid, \'among us, the _samurai_ of the old days. You have your beliefs,\r\nwe have ours. It is my religion that I must place the _katana_ in my\r\nfather\'s grave. My father disgraced himself and sold his sword in order\r\nthat I might not starve when I was a little child. I would rather that\r\nhe had let me die, but since I am alive, and I know that you have the\r\nsword, I must take it and lay it by his bones. I will make an offer.\r\nInstead of giving you money, I will give you another sword--a sword\r\nworth as much money as my father\'s--perhaps more. I have had it sent\r\nfrom Japan since I first saw you. It is a blade made by the great\r\nYukiyasu, and it has a scabbard and mountings by an older and greater\r\nmaster than the Goto who made those for my father\'s sword.\' But it\r\nhappened that Deacon already had two swords by Yukiyasu, while of\r\nMasamun\xc3\xa9 he had only the one. So he tried to reason the Japanese out\r\nof his fancy. But that was useless. Kanamaro called again and again\r\nand got to be quite a nuisance. He left off for a month or two, but\r\nabout a fortnight ago he appeared again. He grew angry and forgot his\r\noriental politeness. \'The English have the English ways,\' he said,\r\n\'and we have ours--yes, though many of my foolish countrymen are in\r\nhaste to be the same as the English are. We have our beliefs, and we\r\nhave our knowledge, and I tell you that there are things which you\r\nwould call superstition, but which are very real! Our old gods are not\r\nall dead yet, I tell you! In the old times no man would wear or keep\r\nanother man\'s sword. Why? Because the great sword has a soul just as\r\na man has, and it knows and the gods know! No man kept another\'s\r\nsword who did not fall into terrible misfortune and death, sooner or\r\nlater. Give me my father\'s _katana_ and save yourself. My father weeps\r\nin my ears at night, and I must bring him his _katana!_\' I was talking\r\nto poor Deacon, as I told you, only on Tuesday afternoon, and he told\r\nme that Kanamaro had been there again the day before, in a frantic\r\nstate--so bad, indeed, that Deacon thought of applying to the Japanese\r\nlegation to have him taken care of, for he seemed quite mad. \'Mind,\r\nyou foolish man!\' he said. \'My gods still live, and they are strong!\r\nMy father wanders on the dark path and cannot go to his gods without\r\nthe swords in his girdle. His father asks of his vow! Between here and\r\nJapan there is a great sea, but my father may walk even here, looking\r\nfor his _katana_, and he is angry! I go away for a little. But my gods\r\nknow, and my father knows!\' And then he took himself off. And now"--Mr.\r\nColson nodded towards the next room and dropped his voice--"now poor\r\nDeacon is dead and the sword is gone!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "GIVE ME MY FATHER\'S KATANA, AND SAVE YOURSELF."]\r\n\r\n"Kanamaro has not been seen about the place, I suppose, since the visit\r\nyou speak of, on Monday?" Dorrington asked.\r\n\r\n"No. And I particularly asked as to yesterday morning. The hall-porter\r\nswears that no Japanese came to the place."\r\n\r\n"As to the letters, now. You say that when Mr. Deacon came back, after\r\nhaving left, apparently to get his lunch, he said he came for forgotten\r\nletters. Were any such letters afterwards found?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--there were three, lying on this very table, stamped ready for\r\npostage."\r\n\r\n"Where are they now?"\r\n\r\n"I have them at my chambers. I opened them in the presence of the\r\npolice in charge of the case. There was nothing very important about\r\nthem--appointments and so forth, merely--and so the police left them in\r\nmy charge, as executor."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless I should like to see them. Not just now, but presently.\r\nI think I must see this man presently--the man who was painting in the\r\nbasement below the window that is supposed to have been shut by the\r\nmurderer in his escape. That is if the police haven\'t frightened him."\r\n\r\n"Very well, we\'ll see after him as soon as you like. There was just\r\none other thing--rather a curious coincidence, though of course there\r\ncan\'t be anything in such a superstitious fancy--but I think I told\r\nyou that Deacon\'s body was found lying at the feet of the four-handed\r\ngod in the other room?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Just so." Mr. Colson seemed to think a little more of the\r\nsuperstitious fancy than he confessed. "Just so," he said again. "At\r\nthe feet of the god, and immediately under the hand carrying the sword;\r\nit is not wooden, but an actual steel sword, in fact."\r\n\r\n"I noticed that."\r\n\r\n"Yes. Now that is a figure of Hachiman, the Japanese god of war--a\r\nrecent addition to the collection and a very ancient specimen. Deacon\r\nbought it at Copleston\'s only a few days ago--indeed it arrived here on\r\nWednesday morning. Deacon was telling me about it on Tuesday afternoon.\r\nHe bought it because of its extraordinary design, showing such signs of\r\nIndian influence. Hachiman is usually represented with no more than the\r\nusual number of a man\'s arms, and with no weapon but a sword. This is\r\nthe only image of Hachiman that Deacon ever saw or heard of with four\r\narms. And after he had bought it he ascertained that this was said to\r\nbe one of the idols that carry with them ill-luck from the moment they\r\nleave their temples. One of Copleston\'s men confided to Deacon that\r\nthe lascar seamen and stokers on board the ship that brought it over\r\nswore that everything went wrong from the moment that Hachiman came\r\non board--and indeed the vessel was nearly lost off Finisterre. And\r\nCopleston himself, the man said, was glad to be quit of it. Things had\r\ndisappeared in the most extraordinary and unaccountable manner, and\r\nother things had been found smashed (notably a large porcelain vase)\r\nwithout any human agency, after standing near the figure. Well," Mr.\r\nColson concluded, "after all that, and remembering what Kanamaro said\r\nabout the gods of his country who watch over ancient swords, it _does_\r\nseem odd, doesn\'t it, that as soon as poor Deacon gets the thing he\r\nshould be found stricken dead at its feet?"\r\n\r\nDorrington was thinking. "Yes," he said presently, "it is certainly a\r\nstrange affair altogether. Let us see the odd-job man now--the man who\r\nwas in the basement below the window. Or rather, find out where he is\r\nand leave me to find him."\r\n\r\nMr. Colson stepped out and spoke with the hall-porter. Presently he\r\nreturned with news. "He\'s gone!" he said. "Bolted!"\r\n\r\n"What--the man who was in the basement?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. It seems the police questioned him pretty closely yesterday, and\r\nhe seized the first opportunity to cut and run."\r\n\r\n"Do you know what they asked him?"\r\n\r\n"Examined him generally, I suppose, as to what he had observed at the\r\ntime. The only thing he seems to have said was that he heard a window\r\nshut at about one o\'clock. Questioned further, he got into confusion\r\nand equivocation, more especially when they mentioned a ladder which\r\nis kept in a passage close by where he was painting. It seems they\r\nhad examined this before speaking to him, and found it had been just\r\nrecently removed and put back. It was thick with dust, except just\r\nwhere it had been taken hold of to shift, and there the hand-marks\r\nwere quite clean. Nobody was in the basement but Dowden (that is the\r\nman\'s name), and nobody else could have shifted that ladder without his\r\nhearing and knowing of it. Moreover, the ladder was just the length\r\nto reach Deacon\'s window. They asked if he had seen anybody move the\r\nladder, and he most anxiously and vehemently declared that he had not.\r\nA little while after he was missing, and he hasn\'t reappeared."\r\n\r\n"And they let him go!" Dorrington exclaimed. "What fools!"\r\n\r\n"He _may_ know something about it, of course," Colson said dubiously;\r\n"but with that sword missing, and knowing what we do of Kanamaro\'s\r\nanxiety to get it at any cost, and--and"--he glanced toward the other\r\nroom where the idol stood--"and one thing and another, it seems to me\r\nwe should look in another direction."\r\n\r\n"We will look in all directions," Dorrington replied. "Kanamaro may\r\nhave enlisted Dowden\'s help. Do you know where to find Kanamaro?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Deacon has had letters from him, which I have seen. He lived in\r\nlodgings near the British Museum."\r\n\r\n"Very well. Now, do you happen to know whether a night porter is kept\r\nat this place?"\r\n\r\n"No, there is none. The outer door is shut at twelve. Anybody coming\r\nhome after that must ring up the housekeeper by the electric bell."\r\n\r\n"The tenants do not have keys for the outer door?"\r\n\r\n"No; none but keys for their own rooms."\r\n\r\n"Good. Now, Mr. Colson, I want to think things over a little. Would\r\nyou care to go at once and ascertain whether or not Kanamaro is still\r\nat the address you speak of?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly, I will. Perhaps I should have told you that, though he\r\nknows me slightly, he has never spoken of his father\'s sword to me, and\r\ndoes not know that I know anything about it. He seems, indeed, to have\r\nspoken about it to nobody but Deacon himself. He was very proud and\r\nreticent in the matter; and now that Deacon is dead, he probably thinks\r\nnobody alive knows of the matter of the sword but himself. If he is at\r\nhome what shall I do?"\r\n\r\n"In that case keep him in sight and communicate with me, or with the\r\npolice. I shall stay here for a little while. Then I shall get the\r\nhall-porter (if you will instruct him before you go) to show me the\r\nladder and the vicinity of Dowden\'s operations. Also, I think I shall\r\nlook at the back staircase."\r\n\r\n"But that was found locked, with the key inside."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, there _are_ ways of managing that, as you would know if\r\nyou knew as much about housebreaking as I do. But we\'ll see."\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nMr. Colson took a cab for Kanamaro\'s lodgings. Kanamaro was not in,\r\nhe found, and he had given notice to leave his rooms. The servant at\r\nthe door thought that he was going abroad, since his boxes were being\r\npacked, apparently for that purpose. The servant did not know at what\r\ntime he would be back.\r\n\r\nMr. Colson thought for a moment of reporting these facts at once to\r\nDorrington, but on second thoughts he determined to hurry to the City\r\nand make inquiry at some of the shipping offices as to the vessels soon\r\nto leave for Japan. On the way, however, he bethought him to buy a\r\nshipping paper and gather his information from that. He found what he\r\nwanted from the paper, but he kept the cab on its way, for he happened\r\nto know a man in authority at the Anglo-Malay Company\'s office, and it\r\nmight be a good thing to take a look at their passenger list. Their\r\nnext ship for Yokohama was to sail in a few days.\r\n\r\nBut he found it unnecessary to see the passenger list. As he entered\r\none of the row of swing doors which gave access to the large general\r\nand inquiry office of the steamship company, he perceived Keigo\r\nKanamaro leaving by another. Kanamaro had not seen him. Mr. Colson\r\nhesitated for a moment, and then turned and followed him.\r\n\r\nAnd now Mr. Colson became suddenly seized with a burning fancy to\r\nplay the subtle detective on his own account. Plainly Kanamaro feared\r\nnothing, walking about thus openly, and taking his passage for Japan\r\nat the chief office of the first line of steamships that anybody would\r\nthink of who contemplated a voyage to Japan, instead of leaving the\r\ncountry, as he might have done, by some indirect route, and shipping\r\nfor Japan from a foreign port. Doubtless, he still supposed that\r\nnobody knew of his errand in search of his father\'s sword. Mr. Colson\r\nquickened his pace and came up beside the Japanese.\r\n\r\nKanamaro was a well-made man of some five feet eight or\r\nnine--remarkably tall for a native of Dai Nippon. His cheek-bones had\r\nnot the prominence noticeable in the Japanese of the lower classes,\r\nand his pale oval face and aquiline nose gave token of high _sikozu_\r\nfamily. His hair only was of the coarse black that is seen on the heads\r\nof all Japanese. He perceived Mr. Colson, and stopped at once with a\r\ngrave bow.\r\n\r\n"Good morning," Mr. Colson said. "I saw you leaving the steamship\r\noffice, and wondered whether or not you were going to leave us."\r\n\r\n"Yes--I go home to Japan by the next departing ship," Kanamaro\r\nanswered. He spoke with an excellent pronunciation, but with the\r\nintonation and the suppression of short syllables peculiar to his\r\ncountrymen who speak English. "My beesness is finished."\r\n\r\nMr. Colson\'s suspicions were more than strengthened--almost confirmed.\r\nHe commanded his features, however, and replied, as he walked by\r\nKeigo\'s side, "Ah! your visit has been successful, then?"\r\n\r\n"It has been successful," Kanamaro answered, "at a very great cost."\r\n\r\n"At a very great cost?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--I did not expect to have to do what I have done--I should once\r\nnot have believed it possible that I _could_ do it. But"--Kanamaro\r\nchecked himself hastily and resumed his grave reserve--"but that is\r\nprivate beesness, and not for me to disturb you with."\r\n\r\nMr. Colson had the tact to leave that line of fishing alone for a\r\nlittle. He walked a few yards in silence, and then asked, with his eyes\r\nfurtively fixed on the face of the Japanese, "Do you know of the god\r\nHachiman?"\r\n\r\n"It is Hachiman the warrior; him of eight flags," Kanamaro replied.\r\n"Yes, I know, of course."\r\n\r\nHe spoke as though he would banish the subject. But Mr. Colson went on--\r\n\r\n"Did he preside over the forging of ancient sword-blades in Japan?" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"I do not know of preside--that is a new word. But the great workers\r\nof the steel, those who made the _katana_ in the times of Yoshitsun\xc3\xa9\r\nand Taiko-Sama, they hung curtains and made offerings to Hachiman when\r\nthey forged a blade--yes. The great Muramasa and the great Masamun\xc3\xa9\r\nand San\xc3\xa9nori--they forged their blades at the foot of Hachiman. And it\r\nis believed that the god Inari came unseen with his hammer and forged\r\nthe steel too. Though Hachiman is Buddhist and Inari is Shinto. But\r\nthese are not things to talk about. There is one religion, which is\r\nyours, and there is another religion, which is mine, and it is not\r\ngood that we talk together of them. There are things that people call\r\nsuperstition when they are of another religion, though they may be very\r\ntrue."\r\n\r\nThey walked a little farther, and then Mr. Colson, determined to\r\npenetrate Kanamaro\'s mask of indifference, observed--\r\n\r\n"It\'s a very sad thing this about Mr. Deacon."\r\n\r\n"What is that?" asked Kanamaro, stolidly.\r\n\r\n"Why, it is in all the newspapers!"\r\n\r\n"The newspapers I do not read at all."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Deacon has been killed--murdered in his rooms! He was found lying\r\ndead at the feet of Hachiman the god."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" Kanamaro answered politely, but with something rather like\r\nstolid indifference. "That is very sad. I am sorry. I did not know he\r\nhad a Hachiman."\r\n\r\n"And they say," Mr. Colson pursued, "that _something_ has been taken!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes," Kanamaro answered, just as coolly; "there were many things\r\nof much value in the rooms." And after a little while he added, "I see\r\nit is a little late. You will excuse me, for I must go to lunch at my\r\nlodgings. Good-day."\r\n\r\nHe bowed, shook hands, and hailed a cab. Mr. Colson heard him direct\r\nthe cabman to his lodgings, and then, in another cab, Mr. Colson made\r\nfor Dorrington\'s office.\r\n\r\nKanamaro\'s stolidity, the lack of anything like surprise at the news\r\nof Mr. Deacon\'s death, his admission that he had finished his business\r\nin England successfully--these things placed the matter beyond all\r\ndoubt in Mr. Colson\'s mind. Plainly he felt so confident that none knew\r\nof his errand in England, that he took things with perfect coolness,\r\nand even ventured so far as to speak of the murder in very near\r\nterms--to say that he did not expect to have to do what he had done,\r\nand would not have believed it possible that he _could_ do it--though,\r\nto be sure, he checked himself at once before going farther. Certainly\r\nDorrington must be told at once. That would be better than going to\r\nthe police, perhaps, for possibly the police might not consider the\r\nevidence sufficient to justify an arrest, and Dorrington may have\r\nascertained something in the meantime.\r\n\r\nDorrington had not been heard of at his office since leaving there\r\nearly in the morning. So Mr. Colson saw Hicks, and arranged that a\r\nman should be put on to watch Kanamaro, and should be sent instantly,\r\nbefore he could leave his lodgings again. Then Mr. Colson hurried to\r\nBedford Mansions.\r\n\r\nThere he saw the housekeeper. From him he learned that Dorrington had\r\nleft some time since, promising either to be back or to telegraph\r\nduring the afternoon. Also, he learned that Beard, the hall-porter, was\r\nin a great state of indignation and anxiety as a consequence of the\r\ndiscovery that he was being watched by the police. He had got a couple\r\nof days leave of absence to go and see his mother, who was ill, and he\r\nfound his intentions and destination a matter of pressing inquiry. Mr.\r\nColson assured the housekeeper that he might promise Beard a speedy\r\nrespite from the attentions of the police, and went to his lunch.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAfter his lunch Mr. Colson called and called again at Bedford Mansions,\r\nbut neither Dorrington nor his telegram had been heard of. At something\r\nnear five o\'clock, however, when he had made up his mind to wait,\r\nrestless as he was, Dorrington appeared, fresh and complacent.\r\n\r\n"Hope you haven\'t been waiting long?" he asked. "Fact is I got no\r\nopportunity for lunch till after four, so I had it then. I think I\'d\r\nfairly earned it. The case is finished."\r\n\r\n"Finished? But there\'s Kanamaro to be arrested. I\'ve found----"\r\n\r\n"No, no--I don\'t think anybody will be arrested at all; you\'ll read\r\nabout it in the evening papers in an hour, I expect. But come into the\r\nrooms. I have some things to show you."\r\n\r\n"But I assure you," Mr. Colson said, as he entered the door of\r\nDeacon\'s rooms, "I assure you that I got as good as a confession from\r\nKanamaro--he let it slip in ignorance of what I knew. Why do you say\r\nthat nobody is to be arrested?"\r\n\r\n"Because there\'s nobody alive who is responsible for Mr. Deacon\'s\r\ndeath. But come--let me show you the whole thing; it\'s very simple."\r\n\r\nHe led the way to the room where the body had been found, and paused\r\nbefore the four-armed idol. "Here\'s our old friend Hachiman," he said,\r\n"whom you half fancied might have had something to do with the tragedy.\r\nWell, you were right. Hachiman had a good deal to do with it, and with\r\nthe various disasters at Copleston\'s too. I will show you how."\r\n\r\nThe figure, which was larger than life-size, had been set up\r\ntemporarily on a large packing-case, hidden by a red cloth covering.\r\nHachiman was represented in the familiar Japanese kneeling-sitting\r\nposition, and the carving of the whole thing was of an intricate and\r\nclose description. The god was represented as clad in ancient armour,\r\nwith a large and loose cloak depending from his shoulders and falling\r\nbehind in a wilderness of marvellously and deeply carved folds.\r\n\r\n"See here," Dorrington said, placing his fingers under a projecting\r\npart of the base of the figure, and motioning to Mr. Colson to do the\r\nsame. "Lift. Pretty heavy, eh?"\r\n\r\nThe idol was, indeed, enormously heavy, and it must have required the\r\nexertions of several strong men to place it where it was. "It seems\r\npretty solid, doesn\'t it?" Dorrington continued. "But look here." He\r\nstepped to the back of the image, and, taking a prominent fold of the\r\ncloak in one hand, with a quick pull and a simultaneous rap of the\r\nother fist two feet above, a great piece of the carved drapery lifted\r\non a hinge near the shoulders, displaying a hollow interior. In a dark\r\ncorner within a small bottle and a fragment of rag were just visible.\r\n\r\n"See there," said Dorrington, "there wouldn\'t be enough room in there\r\nfor you or me, but a small man--a Japanese priest of the old time,\r\nsay--could squat pretty comfortably. And see!"--he pointed to a small\r\nmetal bolt at the bottom of the swing drapery--"he could bolt himself\r\nsafely in when he got there. Whether the priest went there to play the\r\noracle, or to blow fire out of Hachiman\'s mouth and nose I don\'t know,\r\nthough no doubt it might be an interesting subject for inquiry; perhaps\r\nhe did both. You observe the chamber is lined with metal, which does\r\nsomething towards giving the thing its weight, and there are cunning\r\nlittle openings among the armour-joints in front which would transmit\r\nair and sound--even permit of a peep out. Now Mr. Deacon might or might\r\nnot have found out this back door after the figure had been a while in\r\nhis possession, but it is certain he knew nothing of it when he bought\r\nit. Copleston knew nothing of it, though the thing has stood in his\r\nplace for months. You see it\'s not a thing one would notice at once--I\r\nnever should have done so if I hadn\'t been looking for it." He shut the\r\npart, and the joints, of irregular outline, fell into the depths of the\r\nfolds, and vanished as if by magic.\r\n\r\n"Now," Dorrington went on, "as I told you, Copleston knew nothing of\r\nthis, but one of his men found it out. Do you happen to have heard of\r\none Samuel Castro, nicknamed \'Slackjaw,\' a hunchback whom Copleston\r\nemployed on odd jobs?"\r\n\r\n"I have seen him here. He called, sometimes with messages, sometimes\r\nwith parcels. I should probably have forgotten all about him were\r\nit not that he was rather an extraordinary creature, even among\r\nCopleston\'s men, who are all remarkable. But did he----"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "SLACKJAW."]\r\n\r\n"He murdered Mr. Deacon, I think," Dorrington replied, "as I fancy I\r\ncan explain to you. But he won\'t hang for it, for he was drowned this\r\nafternoon before my eyes, in an attempt to escape from the police. He\r\nwas an extraordinary creature, as you have said. He wasn\'t English--a\r\nhalf-caste of some sort I think--though his command of language, of the\r\nriverside and dock description, was very free; it got him his nickname\r\nof Slackjaw among the longshoremen. He was desperately excitable, and\r\nhe had most of the vices, though I don\'t think he premeditated murder\r\nin this case--nothing but robbery. He was immensely strong, although\r\nsuch a little fellow, and sharp in his wits, and he might have had\r\nregular work at Copleston\'s if he had liked, but that wasn\'t his\r\ngame--he was too lazy. He would work long enough to earn a shilling\r\nor so, and then he would go off to drink the money. So he was a\r\nsort of odd on-and-off man at Copleston\'s--just to run a message or\r\ncarry something or what not when the regular men were busy. Well, he\r\nseems to have been smart enough--or perhaps it was no more than an\r\naccident--to find out about Hachiman\'s back, and he used his knowledge\r\nfor his own purposes. Copleston couldn\'t account for missing things in\r\nthe night--because he never guessed that Castro, by shutting himself\r\nup in Hachiman about closing time, had the run of the place when\r\neverybody had gone, and could pick up any trifle that looked suitable\r\nfor the pawnshop in the morning. He could sleep comfortably on sacks\r\nor among straw, and thus save the rent of lodgings, and he could\r\naccept Hachiman\'s shelter again just before Copleston turned up to\r\nstart the next day\'s business. Getting out, too, after the place was\r\nopened, was quite easy, for nobody came to the large store-rooms till\r\nsomething was wanted, and in a large place with many doors and gates,\r\nlike Copleston\'s, unperceived going and coming was easy to one who knew\r\nthe ropes. So that Slackjaw would creep quietly out, and in again by\r\nthe front door to ask for a job. Copleston noticed how regular he had\r\nbeen every morning for the past few months, and thought he was getting\r\nsteadier! As to the things that got smashed, I expect Slackjaw knocked\r\nthem over, getting out in the dark. One china vase, in particular,\r\nhad been shifted at the last moment, probably after he was in his\r\nhiding-place, and stood behind the image. That was smashed, of course.\r\nAnd these things, coming after the bad voyage of the ship in which he\r\ncame over, very naturally gave poor Hachiman an unlucky reputation.\r\n\r\n"Probably Slackjaw was sorry at first when he heard that Hachiman\r\nwas bought. But then an idea struck him. He had been to Mr. Deacon\'s\r\nrooms on errands, and must have seen that fine old plate in the\r\nsitting-room. He had picked up unconsidered trifles at Copleston\'s\r\nby aid of Hachiman--why not acquire something handsome at Deacon\'s\r\nin the same way? The figure was to be carried to Bedford Mansions as\r\nsoon as work began on Wednesday morning. Very well. All he had to do\r\nwas to manage his customary sojourn at Copleston\'s over Tuesday night,\r\nand keep to his hiding-place in the morning. He did it. Perhaps the\r\nmen swore a bit at the weight of Hachiman, but as the idol weighed\r\nseveral hundredweights by itself, and had not been shifted since it\r\nfirst arrived, they most likely perceived no difference. Hachiman, with\r\nSlackjaw comfortably bolted inside him (though even _he_ must have\r\nfound the quarters narrow) jolted away in the waggon, and in course of\r\ntime was deposited where it now stands.\r\n\r\n"Of course all I have told you, and all I am about to tell you, is\r\nno more than conjecture--but I think you will say I have reasons.\r\nFrom within the idol Slackjaw could hear Mr. Deacon\'s movements, and\r\nno doubt when he heard him take his hat and stick and shut the outer\r\ndoor behind him, Hachiman\'s tenant was glad to get out. He had never\r\nhad so long and trying a sojourn in the idol before, though he _had_\r\nprovided himself this time with something to keep his spirits up--in\r\nthat little flat bottle he left behind. Probably, however, he waited\r\nsome little time before emerging, for safety\'s sake. I judge this\r\nbecause I found no signs of his having started work, except a single\r\nsmall knife-mark on the plate case. He must have no more than begun\r\nwhen Mr. Deacon came back for his letters. First, however, he went\r\nand shut the bedroom window, lest his movements might be heard in\r\nsome adjacent rooms; the man who was painting said he heard that, you\r\nremember. Well, hearing Mr. Deacon\'s key in the lock, of course he\r\nmade a rush for his hiding-place--but there was no time to get in and\r\nclose up before Mr. Deacon could hear the noise. Mr. Deacon, as he\r\nentered, heard the footsteps in the next room, and went to see. The\r\nresult you know. Castro, perhaps, crouched behind the idol, and hearing\r\nMr. Deacon approaching, and knowing discovery inevitable, in his mad\r\nfear and excitement, snatched the nearest weapon and struck wildly at\r\nhis pursuer. See! here are half a dozen heavy, short Japanese swords\r\nat hand, any one of which might have been used. The thing done, Castro\r\nhad to think of escape. The door was impossible--the hall-porter was\r\nalready knocking there. But the man had no key--he could be heard\r\nmoving about and calling for one. There was yet a little time. He\r\nwiped the blade of the weapon, put it back in its place, took the keys\r\nfrom the dead man\'s pocket, and regained his concealment in the idol.\r\nWhether or not he took the keys with the idea of again attempting theft\r\nwhen the room was left empty I don\'t know--most likely he thought they\r\nwould aid him in escape. Anyway, he didn\'t attempt theft, but lay in\r\nhis concealment--and a pretty bad time he must have had of it--till\r\nnight. Probably his nerve was not good enough for anything more than\r\nsimple flight. When all was quiet, he left the rooms and shut the door\r\nbehind him. Then he lurked about corridors and basements till morning,\r\nand when the doors were opened, slipped out unobserved. That\'s all.\r\nIt\'s pretty obvious, once you know about Hachiman\'s interior."\r\n\r\n"And how did you find out?"\r\n\r\n"When you left me here I considered the thing. I put aside all\r\nsuspicions of motive, the Japanese and his sword and the rest of it,\r\nand addressed myself to the bare facts. Somebody _had_ been in these\r\nrooms when Mr. Deacon came back, and that somebody had murdered him.\r\nThe first thing was to find how this person came, and where he came\r\nfrom. At first, of course, one thought of the bedroom window, as the\r\npolice had done. But reflection proved this unlikely. Mr. Deacon had\r\nentered his front door, was inside a few seconds, and then was murdered\r\nclose by the figure of Hachiman. Now if anybody had entered by the\r\nwindow for purposes of robbery, his impulse on hearing the key in the\r\nouter door (and such a thing could be heard all over the rooms, as I\r\ntested for myself)--his impulse, I say, would be to retreat by the way\r\nhe had come, that is by the window. If, then, Mr. Deacon had overtaken\r\nhim before he could escape, the murder might have taken place just as\r\nit had done, but it would have been _in the bedroom_, not in a room\r\nin the opposite direction. And any thief\'s attention would naturally\r\nbe directed at first to the gold plate--indeed, I detected a fresh\r\nknife-mark in the door of the case, which I will show you presently.\r\nNow, as you see by the arrangement of the rooms, the retreat from the\r\nplate case to the bedroom window would be a short one, whereas the\r\nmurderer must in fact have taken a longer journey in the opposite\r\ndirection. Why? Because he had _arrived_ from that direction, and his\r\nnatural impulse was to retreat by the way he had come. This might have\r\nbeen by the door to the back stairs, but a careful examination of this\r\ndoor and its lock and key convinced me that it had not been opened.\r\nThe key was dirty, and to have turned it from the opposite side would\r\nhave necessitated the forcible use of a pair of thin hollow pliers\r\n(a familiar tool to burglars), and these must have left their mark\r\non the dirty key. So I turned back to the idol. _This_ was the spot\r\nthe intruder had made for in his retreat, and the figure had been\r\nbrought into the place the very morning of the murder. Also, things\r\nhad disappeared from its vicinity at Copleston\'s. More--it was a large\r\nthing. What if it were hollow? One has heard of such things having been\r\ninvented by priests anxious for certain effects. Could not a thief\r\nsmuggle himself in that way?\r\n\r\n"The suggestion was a little startling, for if it were the right one\r\nthe man might be hiding there at that moment. I gave the thing half an\r\nhour\'s examination, and in the end found what I have shown you. It was\r\nnot the sort of thing one would have found out without looking for it.\r\nLook at it even now. Although you have seen it open, you couldn\'t point\r\nto the joints."\r\n\r\nDorrington opened it again. "Once open," he went on, "the thing\r\nwas pretty plain. Here is the rag--perhaps it was Castro\'s\r\npocket-handkerchief--used to wipe the weapon. It is stained all over,\r\nand cut, as you will observe, by the sharp edge. Also, you may see\r\na crumb or two--Slackjaw had brought food with him, in case of a\r\nlong imprisonment. But chiefly observe the bottle. It is a flat,\r\nhigh-shouldered, \'quartern\' bottle, such as publicans sell or lend to\r\ntheir customers in poor districts, and as usual it bears the publican\'s\r\nname--J. Mills. It\'s a most extraordinary thing, but it seems the fate\r\nof almost every murderer, no matter how cunning, to leave some such\r\ndamning piece of evidence about, foolish as it may seem afterward.\r\nI\'ve known it in a dozen cases. Probably Castro, in the dark and in\r\nhis excitement, forgot it when he quitted his hiding-place. At any\r\nrate it helped me and made my course plain. Clearly this man, whoever\r\nhe was, had come from Copleston\'s. Moreover, he was a small man, for\r\nthe space he had occupied would be too little even for a man of middle\r\nheight. Also he bought drink of J. Mills, a publican; if J. Mills\r\ncarried on business near Copleston\'s so much the easier my task would\r\nseem. Before I left, however, I went to the basement and inspected the\r\nladder, the removal of which had caused the police so much exercise.\r\nThen it was plain why Dowden had cleared out. All his prevarication\r\nand uneasiness were explained at once, as the police might have seen\r\nif they had looked _behind_ the ladder as well as at it. For it had\r\nbeen lying lengthwise against the wooden partition which formed the\r\nback of the compartments put up to serve the tenants as wine-cellars.\r\nDowden had taken three planks out of this partition, and so arranged\r\nthat they could be slipped in their places and out again without\r\nattracting attention. What he had been taking through the holes he thus\r\nmade I won\'t undertake to say, but I will make a small bet that some of\r\nthe tenants find their wine short presently! And so Dowden, never an\r\nindustrious person, and never at one job long, thought it best to go\r\naway when he found the police asking why the ladder had been moved."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes--it\'s very surprising, but no doubt you\'re right. Still, what\r\nabout Kanamaro and that sword?"\r\n\r\n"Tell me exactly what he said to you to-day."\r\n\r\nMr. Colson detailed the conversation at length.\r\n\r\nDorrington smiled. "See here," he said, "I have found out something\r\nelse in these rooms. What Kanamaro said he meant in another sense to\r\nwhat you supposed. _I_ wondered a little about that sword, and made a\r\nlittle search among some drawers in consequence. Look here. Do you see\r\nthis box standing out here on a nest of drawers? That is quite unlike\r\nMr. Deacon\'s orderly ways. The box contains a piece of lacquer, and\r\nit had been shifted from its drawer to make room for a more precious\r\npiece. See here." Dorrington pulled out a drawer just below where the\r\nbox stood, and took from it another white wood box. He opened this\r\nbox and removed a quantity of wadding. A rich brocade _fukusa_ was\r\nthen revealed, and, loosening the cord of this, Dorrington displayed a\r\nJapanese writing-case, or _suzuribako_, aged and a little worn at the\r\ncorners, but all of lacquer of a beautiful violet hue.\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed Mr. Colson. "Violet lacquer!"\r\n\r\n"That is what it is," Dorrington answered, "and when I saw it I judged\r\nat once that Deacon had at last consented to part with his Masamun\xc3\xa9\r\nblade in exchange for that even greater rarity, a fine piece of the\r\nreal old violet lacquer. I should imagine that Kanamaro brought it on\r\nTuesday evening--you will remember that you saw Mr. Deacon for the\r\nlast time alive in the afternoon of that day. Beard seems not to have\r\nnoticed him, but in the evening hall-porters are apt to be at supper,\r\nyou know--perhaps even taking a nap now and then!"\r\n\r\n"Then _this_ is how Kanamaro \'finished his business\'!" Mr. Colson\r\nobserved. "And the \'very great cost\' was probably what he had to pay\r\nfor this."\r\n\r\n"I suppose so. And he would not have believed it possible that he\r\n_could_ get a piece of violet lacquer in any circumstances."\r\n\r\n"But," Mr. Colson objected, "I still don\'t understand his indifference\r\nand lack of surprise when I told him of poor Deacon\'s death."\r\n\r\n"I think that is very natural in such a man as Keigo Kanamaro. I\r\ndon\'t profess to know a very great deal about Japan, but I know that\r\na _samurai_ of the old school was trained from infancy to look on\r\ndeath, whether his own or another\'s, with absolute indifference. They\r\nregarded it as a mere circumstance. Consider how cold-bloodedly their\r\n_hari-kiri_, their legalised suicide, was carried out!"\r\n\r\nAs they left the rooms and made for the street Mr. Colson said, "But\r\nnow I know nothing of your pursuit of Castro."\r\n\r\nDorrington shrugged his shoulders. "There is little to say," he said.\r\n"I went to Copleston and asked him if any one of his men was missing\r\nall day on Wednesday. None of his regular men were, it seemed, but he\r\nhad seen nothing that day of an odd man named Castro, or Slackjaw,\r\nalthough he had been very regular for some time before; and, indeed,\r\nCastro had not yet turned up. I asked if Castro was a tall man. No,\r\nhe was a little fellow and a hunchback, Copleston told me. I asked\r\nwhat public-house one might find him at, and Copleston mentioned\r\nthe \'Blue Anchor\'--kept, as I had previously ascertained from the\r\ndirectory, by J. Mills. That was enough. With everything standing as it\r\nwas, a few minutes\' talk with the inspector in charge at the nearest\r\npolice-station was all that was necessary. Two men were sent to make\r\nthe arrest, and the people at the \'Blue Anchor\' directed us to Martin\'s\r\nWharf, where we found Castro. He had been drinking, but he knew enough\r\nto make a bolt the moment he saw the policemen coming on the wharf.\r\nHe dropped on to a dummy barge and made off from one barge to another\r\nin what seemed an aimless direction, though he may have meant to get\r\naway at the stairs a little lower down the river. But he never got as\r\nfar. He muddled one jump and fell between the barges. You know what a\r\nsuck under there is when a man falls among barges like that. A strong\r\nswimmer with all his senses has only an off chance, and a man with bad\r\nwhisky in his head--well, I left them dragging for Slackjaw when I came\r\naway."\r\n\r\nAs they turned the corner of the street they met a newsboy running.\r\n"Paper--speshal!" he cried. "The West-End murder--speshal! Suicide of\r\nthe murderer!"\r\n\r\nDorrington\'s conjecture that Kanamaro had called to make his exchange\r\non Tuesday evening proved correct. Mr. Colson saw him once more on the\r\nday of his departure, and told him the whole story. And then Keigo\r\nKanamaro sailed for Japan to lay the sword in his father\'s tomb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_OLD CATER\'S MONEY_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nOld Cater\'s Money\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe firm of Dorrington & Hicks had not been constructed at the time\r\nwhen this case came to Dorrington\'s hand. Dorrington had barely emerged\r\nfrom the obscurity that veils his life before some ten years ago,\r\nand he was at this time a needier adventurer than he had been at the\r\nperiod of any other of the cases I have related. Indeed, his illicit\r\ngains on this occasion would seem first to have set him on his feet\r\nand enabled him first to cut a fair exterior figure. Whether or not\r\nhe had developed to the full the scoundrelism that first brought me\r\nacquainted with his trade I do not know; but certain it is that he was\r\ninvolved at the time in transactions wretchedly ill paid, on behalf\r\nof one Flint, a shipstores dealer at Deptford; an employer whose\r\nrecord was never a very clean one. This Flint was one of an unpleasant\r\nfamily. He was nephew to old Cater the wharfinger (and private usurer)\r\nand cousin to another Cater, whose name was Paul, and who was also a\r\nusurer, though he variously described himself as a "commission agent"\r\nor "general dealer." Indeed, he was a general dealer, if the term may\r\nbe held to include a dealer in whatever would bring him gain, and\r\nwho made no great punctilio in regard to the honesty or otherwise\r\nof his transactions. In fact, all three of these pleasant relatives\r\nhad records of the shadiest, and all three did whatever in the way\r\nof money-lending, mortgaging, and blood-sucking came in their way.\r\nIt is, however, with old Cater--Jerry Cater, he was called--that\r\nthis narrative is in the first place concerned. I got the story from\r\na certain Mr. Sinclair, who for many years acted as his clerk and\r\ndebt-collector.\r\n\r\nOld Jerry Cater lived in the crooked and decaying old house over his\r\nwharf by Bermondsey Wall, where his father had lived before him. It\r\nwas a grim and strange old house, with long-shut loft-doors in upper\r\nfloors, and hinged flaps in sundry rooms that, when lifted, gave\r\nstartling glimpses of muddy water washing among rotten piles below. Not\r\nonce in six months now did a barge land its load at Cater\'s Wharf, and\r\nno coasting brig ever lay alongside. For, in fact, the day of Cater\'s\r\nWharf was long past; and it seemed indeed that few more days were left\r\nfor old Jerry Cater himself. For seventy-eight years old Jerry Cater\r\nhad led a life useless to himself and to everybody else, though his\r\nown belief was that he had profited considerably. Truly if one counted\r\nnothing but the money the old miser had accumulated, then his profit\r\nwas large indeed; but it had brought nothing worth having, neither for\r\nhimself nor for others, and he had no wife nor child who might use\r\nit more wisely when he should at last leave it behind him; no other\r\nrelative indeed than his two nephews, each in spirit a fair copy of\r\nhimself, though in body a quarter of a century younger. Seventy-eight\r\nyears of every mean and sordid vice and of every virtue that had\r\npecuniary gain for its sole object left Jerry Cater stranded at last\r\nin his cheap iron bedstead with its insufficient coverings, with not\r\na sincere friend in the world to sit five minutes by his side. Down\r\nbelow, Sinclair, his unhappy clerk, had the accommodation of a wooden\r\ntable and a chair; and the clerk\'s wife performed what meagre cooking\r\nand cleaning service old Cater would have. Sinclair was a man of\r\nforty-five, rusty, starved, honest, and very cheap. He was very cheap\r\nbecause it had been his foolishness, twenty years ago, when in City\r\nemploy, to borrow forty pounds of old Cater to get married with, and to\r\nbuy furniture, together with forty pounds he had of his own. Sinclair\r\nwas young then, and knew nothing of the ways of the two hundred per\r\ncent. money-lender. When he had, by three or four years\' pinching, paid\r\nabout a hundred and fifty pounds on account of interest and fines, and\r\nonly had another hundred or two still due to clear everything off, he\r\nfell sick and lost his place. The payment of interest ceased, and old\r\nJerry Cater took his victim\'s body, soul, wife, sticks, and chairs\r\ntogether. Jerry Cater discharged his own clerk, and took Sinclair, with\r\na saving of five shillings a week on the nominal salary, and out of the\r\nremainder he deducted, on account of the debt and ever-accumulating\r\ninterest, enough to keep his man thin and broken-spirited, without\r\nabsolutely incapacitating him from work, which would have been bad\r\nfinance. But the rest of the debt, capital and interest, was made into\r\na capital debt, with usury on the whole. So that for sixteen years or\r\nmore Sinclair had been paying something every week off the eternally\r\nincreasing sum, and might have kept on for sixteen centuries at the\r\nsame rate without getting much nearer freedom. If only there had been\r\none more room in the house old Cater might have compulsorily lodged\r\nhis clerk, and have deducted something more for rent. As it was he\r\nmight have used the office for the purpose, but he could never have\r\nbrought himself to charge a small rent for it, and a large one would\r\nhave swallowed most of the rest of Sinclair\'s salary, thus bringing\r\nhim below starvation point, and impairing his working capacity. But\r\nMrs. Sinclair, now gaunt and scraggy, did all the housework, so that\r\nthat came very cheap. Most of the house was filled with old bales and\r\nrotting merchandise which old Jerry Cater had seized in payment for\r\nwharfage dues and other debts, and had held to, because his ideas of\r\nselling prices were large, though his notion of buying prices were\r\nsmall. Sinclair was out of doors more than in, dunning and threatening\r\ndebtors as hopeless as himself. And the household was completed by one\r\nSamuel Greer, a squinting man of grease and rags, within ten years of\r\nthe age of old Jerry Cater himself. Greer was wharf-hand, messenger,\r\nand personal attendant on his employer, and, with less opportunity, was\r\nthought to be near as bad a scoundrel as Cater. He lived and slept in\r\nthe house, and was popularly supposed to be paid nothing at all; though\r\nhis patronage of the "Ship and Anchor," hard by, was as frequent as\r\nmight be.\r\n\r\nOld Jerry Cater was plainly not long for this world. Ailing for months,\r\nhe at length gave in and took to his bed. Greer watched him anxiously\r\nand greedily, for it was his design, when his master went at last,\r\nto get what he could for himself. More than once during his illness\r\nold Cater had sent Greer to fetch his nephews. Greer had departed on\r\nthese errands, but never got farther than the next street. He hung\r\nabout a reasonable time--perhaps in the "Ship and Anchor," if funds\r\npermitted--and then returned to say that the nephews could not come\r\njust yet. Old Cater had quarrelled with his nephews, as he had with\r\neverybody else, some time before, and Greer was resolved, if he could,\r\nto prevent any meeting now, for that would mean that the nephews would\r\ntake possession of the place, and he would lose his chance of\r\nconvenient larceny when the end came. So it was that neither nephew\r\nknew of old Jerry Cater\'s shaky condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "HE SAW A FEW DOUBLED PAPERS."]\r\n\r\nBefore long, finding that the old miser could not leave his bed--indeed\r\nhe could scarcely turn in it--Greer took courage, in Sinclair\'s\r\nabsence, to poke about the place in search of concealed sovereigns. He\r\nhad no great time for this, because Jerry Cater seemed to have taken a\r\ngreat desire for his company, whether for the sake of his attendance\r\nor to keep him out of mischief was not clear. At any rate Greer found\r\nno concealed sovereigns, nor anything better than might be sold for\r\na few pence at the ragshop. Until one day, when old Cater was taking\r\nalternate fits of restlessness and sleep, Greer ventured to take down\r\na dusty old pickle-jar from the top shelf in the cupboard of his\r\nmaster\'s bedroom. Cater was dozing at the moment, and Greer, tilting\r\nthe jar toward the light, saw within a few doubled papers, very dusty.\r\nHe snatched the papers out, stuffed them into his pocket, replaced the\r\njar, and closed the cupboard door hastily. The door made some little\r\nnoise, and old Cater turned and woke, and presently he made a shift\r\nto sit up in bed, while Greer scratched his head as innocently as he\r\ncould, and directed his divergent eyes to parts of the room as distant\r\nfrom the cupboard as possible.\r\n\r\n"Sam\'l Greer," said old Cater in a feeble voice, while his lower jaw\r\nwaggled and twitched, "Sam\'l Greer, I think I\'ll \'ave some beef-tea."\r\nHe groped tremulously under his pillow, turning his back to Greer,\r\nwho tip-toed and glared variously over his master\'s shoulders. He saw\r\nnothing, however, though he heard the chink of money. Old Cater turned,\r\nwith a shilling in his shaking hand. "Git \'alf a pound o\' shin o\'\r\nbeef," he said, "an\' go to Green\'s for it at the other end o\' Grange\r\nRoad, d\'ye hear? It\'s--it\'s a penny a pound cheaper there than it is\r\nanywhere nearer, and--and I ain\'t in so much of a \'urry for it, so the\r\ndistance don\'t matter. Go \'long." And old Jerry Cater subsided in a fit\r\nof coughing.\r\n\r\nGreer needed no second bidding. He was anxious to take a peep at the\r\npapers he had secreted. Sinclair was out collecting, or trying to\r\ncollect, but Greer did not stop to examine his prize before he had\r\nbanged the street door behind him, lest Cater, listening above, should\r\nwonder what detained him. But in a convenient courtyard a hundred\r\nyards away he drew out the papers and inspected them eagerly. First,\r\nthere was the policy of insurance of the house and premises. Then\r\nthere was a bundle of receipts for the yearly insurance premiums. And\r\nthen--there was old Jerry Cater\'s will.\r\n\r\nThere were two foolscap sheets, written all in Jerry Cater\'s own\r\nstraggling handwriting. Greer hastily scanned the sheets, and his\r\ndirty face grew longer and his squint intensified as he turned over\r\nthe second sheet, found nothing behind it, and stuffed the papers\r\nback in his pocket. For it was plain that not a penny of old Jerry\r\nCater\'s money was for his faithful servant, Samuel Greer. "Ungrateful\r\nole waga-bone!" mused the faithful servant as he went his way. "Not\r\na blessed \'a\'peny; not a \'a\'peny! An\' them as don\'t want it gets it,\r\no\' course. That\'s always the way--it\'s like a-greasing\' of a fat\r\npig. I shall \'ave to get what I can while I can, that\'s all." And so\r\nruminating he pursued his way to the butcher\'s in Grange Road.\r\n\r\nOnce more on his way there, and twice on his way back, Samuel Greer\r\nstepped into retired places to look at those papers again, and at each\r\ninspection he grew more thoughtful. There might be money in it yet.\r\nCome, he must think it over.\r\n\r\nThe front door being shut, and Sinclair probably not yet returned, he\r\nentered the house by a way familiar to the inmates--a latched door\r\ngiving on to the wharf. The clock told him that he had been gone nearly\r\nan hour, but Sinclair was still absent. When he entered old Cater\'s\r\nroom upstairs he found a great change. The old man lay in a state of\r\ncollapse, choking with a cough that exhausted him; and for this there\r\nseemed little wonder, for the window was open, and the room was full of\r\nthe cold air from the river.\r\n\r\n"Wot jer bin openin\' the winder for?" asked Greer in astonishment.\r\n"It\'s enough to give ye yer death." He shut it and returned to the\r\nbedside. But though he offered his master the change from the shilling\r\nthe old man seemed not to see it nor to hear his voice.\r\n\r\n"Well, if you won\'t--don\'t," observed Greer with some alacrity,\r\npocketing the coppers. "But I\'ll bet he\'ll remember right enough\r\npresently." "D\'y\'ear," he added, bending over the bed, "I\'ve got the\r\nbeef. Shall I bile it now?"\r\n\r\nBut old Jerry Cater\'s eyes still saw nothing and he heard not, though\r\nhis shrunken chest and shoulders heaved with the last shudders of the\r\ncough that had exhausted him. So Greer stepped lightly to the cupboard\r\nand restored the fire policy and the receipts to the pickle-jar. He\r\nkept the will.\r\n\r\nGreer made preparations for cooking the beef, and as he did so he\r\nencountered another phenomenon. "Well, he have bin a goin\' of it!" said\r\nGreer. "Blow me if he ain\'t bin readin\' the Bible now!"\r\n\r\nA large, ancient, worn old Bible, in a rough calf-skin cover, lay on a\r\nchair by old Cater\'s hand. It had probably been the family Bible of the\r\nCaters for generations back, for certainly old Jerry Cater would never\r\nhave bought such a thing. For many years it had accumulated dust on a\r\ndistant shelf among certain out-of-date account-books, but Greer had\r\nnever heard of its being noticed before. "Feels he goin\', that\'s about\r\nit," Greer mused as he pitched the Bible back on the shelf to make room\r\nfor his utensils. "But I shouldn\'t ha\' thought \'e\'d take it sentimental\r\nlike that--readin\' the Bible an\' lettin\' in the free air of \'eaven to\r\nmake \'im cough \'isself blind."\r\n\r\nThe beef-tea was set simmering, and still old Cater lay impotent.\r\nThe fit of prostration was longer than any that had preceded it, and\r\npresently Greer thought it might be well to call the doctor. Call him\r\nhe did accordingly (the surgery was hard by), and the doctor came.\r\nJerry Cater revived a little, sufficiently to recognise the doctor, but\r\nit was his last effort. He lived another hour and a half. Greer kept\r\nthe change and had the beef-tea as well. The doctor gave his opinion\r\nthat the old man had risen in delirium and had expended his last\r\nstrength in moving about the room and opening the window.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nSamuel Greer found somewhere near two pounds in silver in the small\r\ncanvas bag under the dead man\'s pillow. No more money, however,\r\nrewarded his hasty search about the bedroom, and when Sinclair returned\r\nGreer set off to carry the news to Paul Cater, the dead man\'s nephew.\r\n\r\nThe respectable Greer had considered well the matter of the will,\r\nand saw his way, he fancied, at least to a few pounds by way\r\nof compensation for his loss of employment and the ungrateful\r\nforgetfulness of his late employer. The two sheets comprised, in fact,\r\nnot a simple will merely, but a will and a codicil, each on one of the\r\nsheets, the codicil being a year or two more recent than the will.\r\nNobody apparently knew anything of these papers, and it struck Greer\r\nthat it was now in his power to prevent anybody learning, unless an\r\ninterested party were disposed to pay for the disclosure. That was\r\nwhy he now took his way toward the establishment of Paul Cater, for\r\nthe will made Paul Cater not only sole executor, but practically sole\r\nlegatee. Wherefore Greer carefully separated the will from the codicil,\r\nintending the will alone for sale to Paul Cater. Because, indeed, the\r\ncodicil very considerably modified it, and might form the subject of\r\nindependent commerce.\r\n\r\nPaul Cater made a less miserly show than had been the wont of his\r\nuncle. His house was in a street in Pimlico, the ground-floor front\r\nroom of which was made into an office, with a wire blind carrying his\r\nname in gilt letters. Perhaps it was that Paul Cater carried his\r\ncovetousness to a greater refinement than his uncle had done, seeing\r\nthat a decent appearance is a commercial advantage by itself, bringing\r\na greater profit than miserly habits could save.\r\n\r\nThe man of general dealings was balancing his books when Greer arrived,\r\nbut at the announcement of his uncle\'s death he dropped everything. He\r\nwas not noticeably stricken with grief, unless a sudden seizure of his\r\nhat and a roaring aloud for a cab might be considered as indications\r\nof affliction; for in truth Paul Cater knew well that it was a case in\r\nwhich much might depend on being first at Bermondsey Wall. The worthy\r\nGreer had scarce got the news out before he found himself standing in\r\nthe street while Cater was giving directions to a cabman. "Here--you\r\ncome in too," said Cater, and Greer was bustled into the cab.\r\n\r\nIt was plainly a situation in which half-crowns should not be too\r\nreluctantly parted with. So Paul Cater produced one and presented it.\r\nCater was a strong-faced man of fifty odd, with a tight-drawn mouth\r\nthat proclaimed everywhere a tight fist; so that the unaccustomed\r\npassing over of a tip was a noticeably awkward and unspontaneous\r\nperformance, and Greer pocketed the money with little more\r\nacknowledgment than a growl.\r\n\r\n"Do you know where he put the will?" asked Paul Cater with a keen\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n"Will?" answered Greer, looking him blankly in the face--the gaze of\r\none eye passing over Cater\'s shoulder and that of the other seeming to\r\nseek his boots. "Will? P\'raps \'e never made one."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"That \'ud mean, lawfully, as the property would come to you an\' Mr.\r\nFlint--\'arves. Bein\' all personal property. So I\'d think." And Greer\'s\r\ncomposite gaze blankly persisted.\r\n\r\n"But how do you know whether he made a will or not?"\r\n\r\n"\'Ow do I know? Ah, well, p\'raps I dunno. It\'s only fancy like. I\r\njist put it to you--that\'s all. It \'ud be divided atween the two of\r\nyou." Then, after a long pause, he added: "But lor! it \'ud be a pretty\r\nfine thing for you if he did leave a will, and willed it all to you,\r\nwouldn\'t it? Mighty fine thing! An\' it \'ud be a mighty fine thing for\r\nMr. Flint if there was a will leaving it all to him, wouldn\'t it?\r\nPretty fine thing!"\r\n\r\nCater said nothing, but watched Greer\'s face sharply. Greer\'s face,\r\nwith its greasy features and its irresponsible squint, was as\r\nexpressive as a brick. They travelled some distance in silence. Then\r\nGreer said musingly, "Ah, a will like that \'ud be a mighty fine thing!\r\nWhat \'ud you be disposed to give for it now?"\r\n\r\n"Give for it? What do you mean? If there\'s a will there\'s an end to it.\r\nWhy should I give anything for it?"\r\n\r\n"Jist so--jist so," replied Greer, with a complacent wave of the hand.\r\n"Why should you? No reason at all, unless you couldn\'t find it without\r\ngivin\' something."\r\n\r\n"See here, now," said Cater sharply, "let us understand this. Do you\r\nmean that there is a will, and you know that it is hidden, and where it\r\nis?"\r\n\r\nGreer\'s squint remained impenetrable. "Hidden? Lor!--\'ow should I know\r\nif it was hidden? I was a-puttin\' of a case to you."\r\n\r\n"Because," Cater went on, disregarding the reply, "if that\'s the case,\r\nthe sooner you out with the information the better it\'ll be for you.\r\nBecause there are ways of making people give up information of that\r\nsort for nothing."\r\n\r\n"Yes--o\' course," replied the imperturbable Greer. "O\' course there is.\r\nAn\' quite right too. Ah, it\'s a fine thing is the lawr--a mighty fine\r\nthing!"\r\n\r\nThe cab rattled over the stones of Bermondsey Wall, and the two\r\nalighted at the door through which old Jerry Cater was soon to come\r\nfeet first. Sinclair was back, much disturbed and anxious. At sight of\r\nPaul Cater the poor fellow, weak and broken-spirited, left the house as\r\nquietly as he might. For years of grinding habit had inured him to the\r\nbelief that in reality old Cater had treated him rather well, and now\r\nhe feared the probable action of the heirs.\r\n\r\n"Who was that?" asked Paul Cater of Greer. "Wasn\'t it the clerk that\r\nowed my uncle the money?"\r\n\r\nGreer nodded.\r\n\r\n"Then he\'s not to come here again--do you hear? I\'ll take charge of the\r\nbooks and things. As to the debt--well, I\'ll see about that after. And\r\nnow look here." Paul Cater stood before Greer and spoke with decision.\r\n"About that will, now. Bring it."\r\n\r\nGreer was not to be bluffed. "Where from?" he asked innocently.\r\n\r\n"Will you stand there and tell me you don\'t know where it is?"\r\n\r\n"Maybe I\'d best stand here and tell you what pays me best."\r\n\r\n"Pay you? How much more do you want? Bring me that will, or I\'ll have\r\nyou in gaol for stealing it!"\r\n\r\n"Lor!" answered Greer composedly, conscious of holding another trump\r\nas well as the will. "Why, if there _was_ anybody as knowed where the\r\nwill was, and you talked to him as violent as that \'ere, why, you\'d\r\nfrighten him so much he\'d as likely as not go out and get a price from\r\nyour cousin, Mr. Flint. Whatever was in the will it might pay him to\r\nget hold of it."\r\n\r\nAt this moment there came a furious knocking at the front door. "Why,"\r\nGreer continued, "I bet that\'s him. It can\'t be nobody else--I bet the\r\ndoctor\'s told him, or summat."\r\n\r\nThey were on the first-floor landing, and Greer peeped from a\r\nbroken-shuttered window that looked on the street. "Yes," he said,\r\n"that\'s Mr. Flint sure enough. Now, Mr. Paul Cater, business. Do you\r\nwant to see that will before I let Mr. Flint in?"\r\n\r\n"Yes!" exclaimed Cater furiously, catching at his arm. "Quick--where is\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"I want twenty pound."\r\n\r\n"Twenty pound! You\'re mad! What for?"\r\n\r\n"All right, if I\'m mad, I\'ll go an\' let Mr. Flint in."\r\n\r\nThe knocking was repeated, louder and longer.\r\n\r\n"No," cried Cater, getting in his way. "You know you mustn\'t conceal a\r\nwill--that\'s law. Give it up."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the law that says I must give it up to you, \'stead of yer\r\ncousin? _If_ there\'s a will it may say anythin\'--in yer favour or out\r\nof it. If there ain\'t, you\'ll git \'alf. The will might give you more,\r\nor it might give you less, or it might give you nothink. Twenty pound\r\nfor first look at it \'fore Flint comes in, and do what you like with it\r\n\'fore he knows anythink about it."\r\n\r\nAgain the knocking came at the door, this time supplemented by kicks.\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t carry twenty pound about with me!" protested Cater, waving\r\nhis fists. "Give me the will and come to my office for the money\r\nto-morrow!"\r\n\r\n"No tick for this sort of job," answered Greer decisively. "Sorry I\r\ncan\'t oblige you--I\'m goin\' down to the front door." And he made as\r\nthough to go.\r\n\r\n"Well, look here!" said Cater desperately, pulling out his pocket-book.\r\n"I\'ve got a note or two, I think----"\r\n\r\n"\'Ow much?" asked Greer, calmly laying hold of the pocket-book. "Two at\r\nleast. Two fivers. Well, I\'ll let it go at that. Give us hold." He took\r\nthe notes, and pulled out the will from his pocket. Flint, outside,\r\nbattered the door once more.\r\n\r\n"Why," exclaimed Cater as he glanced over the sheet, "I\'m sole executor\r\nand I get the lot! Who are these witnesses?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, they\'re all right. Longshore hands just hereabout. You\'ll get \'em\r\nany day at the \'Ship and Anchor.\'"\r\n\r\nCater put the will in his breast-pocket. "You\'d best get out o\' this,\r\nmy man," he said. "You\'ve had me for ten pound, and the further you get\r\nfrom me the safer you\'ll be."\r\n\r\n"What?" said Greer with a chuckle. "Not even grateful! Shockin\'!" He\r\ntook his way downstairs, and Cater followed. At the door Flint, a\r\ncounterpart of Cater, except that his dress was more slovenly, stood\r\nragefully.\r\n\r\n"Ah, cousin," said Cater, standing on the threshold and preventing his\r\nentrance, "this is a very sad loss!"\r\n\r\n"Sad loss!" Flint replied with disgust. "A lot you think of the\r\nloss--as much as I do, I reckon. I want to come in."\r\n\r\n"Then you sha\'n\'t!" Cater replied, with a prompt change of manner.\r\n"You shan\'t! I\'m sole executor, and I\'ve got the will in my pocket."\r\nHe pulled it out sufficiently far to show the end of the paper, and\r\nthen returned it. "As executor I\'m in charge of the property, and\r\nresponsible. It\'s vested in me till the will\'s put into effect. That\'s\r\nlaw. And it\'s a bad thing for anybody to interfere with an executor.\r\nThat\'s law too."\r\n\r\nFlint was angry, but cautious. "Well," he said, "you\'re uncommon high,\r\nwith your will and your executor\'s law and your \'sad loss,\' I must say.\r\nWhat\'s your game?"\r\n\r\nFor answer Cater began to shut the door.\r\n\r\n"Just you look out!" cried Flint. "You haven\'t heard the last of this!\r\nYou may be executor or it may be a lie. You may have the will or you\r\nmay not; anyway I know better than to run the risk of putting myself\r\nin the wrong now. But I\'ll watch you, and I\'ll watch this house, and\r\nI\'ll be about when the will comes to be proved! And if that ain\'t done\r\nquick, I\'ll apply for administration myself, and see the thing through!"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nSamuel Greer sheered off as the cousinly interview ended, well\r\nsatisfied with himself. Ten pounds was a fortune to him, and he meant\r\nhaving a good deal more. He did nothing further till the following\r\nmorning, when he presented himself at the shop of Jarvis Flint.\r\n\r\n"Good mornin\', Mr. Flint," said Samuel Greer, grinning and squinting\r\naffably. "I couldn\'t help noticin\' as you had a few words yesterday\r\nwith Mr. Cater after the sad loss."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"It \'appens as I\'ve seen the will as Mr. Cater was talkin\' of, an\' I\r\nthought p\'raps it \'ud save you makin\' mistakes if I told you of it."\r\n\r\n"What about it?" Jarvis Flint was not disposed to accept Greer\r\naltogether on trust.\r\n\r\n"Well it _do_ seem a scandalous thing, certainly, but what Mr. Cater\r\nsaid was right. He _do_ take the personal property, subjick to debts,\r\nan\' he do take the freehold prim\'ses. An\' he is the \'xecutor."\r\n\r\n"Was the will witnessed?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--two waterside chaps well know\'d there-abouts."\r\n\r\n"Was it made by a lawyer?"\r\n\r\n"No--all in the lamented corpse\'s \'andwritin\'."\r\n\r\n"Umph!" Flint maintained his hard stare in Greer\'s face. "Anything\r\nelse?"\r\n\r\n"Well, no, Mr. Flint, sir, p\'raps not. But I wonder if there might be\r\nsich a thing as a codicil?"\r\n\r\n"Is there?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I was a-wonderin\', that\'s all. It might make a deal o\' difference\r\nin the will, mightn\'t it? And p\'raps Mr. Cater mightn\'t know anythink\r\nabout the codicil."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean? Is there a codicil?"\r\n\r\n"Well, reely, Mr. Flint," answered Greer with a deprecatory\r\ngrin--"reely it ain\'t business to give information for nothink, is it?"\r\n\r\n"Business or not, if you know anything you\'ll find you\'ll have to tell\r\nit. I\'m not going to let Cater have it all his own way, if he _is_\r\nexecutor. My lawyer\'ll be on the job before you\'re a day older, my\r\nman, and you won\'t find it pay to keep things too quiet."\r\n\r\n"But it can\'t pay worse than to give information for nothink,"\r\npersisted Greer. "Come, now, Mr. Flint, s\'pose (I don\'t say there is,\r\nmind--I only say _s\'pose_)--s\'pose there _was_ a codicil, and s\'pose\r\nthat codicil meant a matter of a few thousand pound in your pocket.\r\nAnd s\'pose some person could tell you where to put your hand on that\r\ncodicil, what might you be disposed to pay that person?"\r\n\r\n"Bring me the codicil," answered Flint, "and if it\'s all right I\'ll\r\ngive you--well, say five shillings."\r\n\r\nGreer grinned again and shook his head. "No, reely, Mr. Flint," he\r\nsaid, "we can\'t do business on terms like them. Fifty pound down in my\r\nhand now, and it\'s done. Fifty \'ud be dirt cheap. And the longer you\r\nare a-considerin\'--well, you know, Mr. Cater might get hold of it, and\r\nthen, why, s\'pose it got burnt and never \'eard of agen?"\r\n\r\nFlint glared with round eyes. "You get out!" he said. "Go on! Fifty\r\npound, indeed! Fifty pound, without my knowing whether you\'re telling\r\nlies or not! Out you go! I know what to do now, my man!"\r\n\r\nGreer grinned once more, and slouched out. He had not expected to\r\nbring Flint to terms at once. Of course the man would drive him away\r\nat first, and, having got scent of the existence of the codicil,\r\nand supposing it to be somewhere concealed about the old house at\r\nBermondsey Wall, he would set his lawyer to warn his cousin that the\r\nthing was known, and that he, as executor, would be held responsible\r\nfor it. But the trump card, the codicil itself, was carefully stowed in\r\nthe lining of Greer\'s hat, and Cater knew nothing about it. Presently\r\nFlint, finding Cater obdurate, would approach the wily Greer again, and\r\nthen he could be squeezed. Meanwhile the hat-lining was as safe a place\r\nas any in which to keep the paper. Perhaps Flint might take a fancy to\r\nhave him waylaid at night and searched, in which case a pocket would be\r\nan unsafe repository.\r\n\r\nFlint, on his part, was in good spirits. Plainly there _was_ a codicil,\r\nfavourable to himself. Certainly he meant neither to pay Greer for\r\ndiscovering it--at any rate no such sum as fifty pounds--nor to abate a\r\njot of his rights. Flint had a running contract with a shady solicitor,\r\nnamed Lugg, in accordance with which Lugg received a yearly payment\r\nand transacted all his legal business--consisting chiefly of writing\r\nthreatening letters to unfortunate debtors. Also, as I think I have\r\nmentioned, Dorrington was working for him at the time, and working at\r\nvery cheap rates. Flint resolved, to begin with, to set Dorrington\r\nand Lugg to work. But first Dorrington--who, as a matter of fact, was\r\nin Flint\'s back office during the interview with Greer. Thus it was\r\nthat in an hour or two Dorrington found himself in active pursuit of\r\nSamuel Greer, with instructions to watch him closely, to make him drunk\r\nif possible, and to get at his knowledge of the codicil by any means\r\nconceivable.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the day after his talk with Flint, Samuel Greer\r\nruminated doubtfully on the advisability of calling on the ship-store\r\ndealer again, or waiting in dignified silence till Flint should\r\napproach him. As he ruminated he rubbed his chin, and so rubbing it\r\nfound it very stubbly. He resolved on the luxury of a penny shave,\r\nand, as he walked the street, kept his eyes open for a shop where the\r\noperation was performed at that price. Mr. Flint, at any rate, could\r\nwait till his chin was smooth. Presently, in a turning by Abbey Street,\r\nBermondsey, he came on just such a barber\'s shop as he wanted. Within,\r\ntwo men were being shaved already, and another waiting; and Greer felt\r\nhimself especially fortunate in that three more followed at his heels.\r\nHe was ahead of their turns, anyhow. So he waited patiently.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "HIS WALK WAS UNSTEADY."]\r\n\r\nThe man whose turn was immediately before his own did not appear to be\r\naltogether sober. A hiccough shook him from time to time; he grinned\r\nwith a dull glance at a comic paper held upside down in his hand, and\r\nwhen he went to take his turn at a chair his walk was unsteady. The\r\nbarber had to use his skill to avoid cutting him, and he opened his\r\nmouth to make remarks at awkward times. Then Greer\'s turn came at the\r\nother chair, and when his shave was half completed he saw the unsteady\r\ncustomer rise, pay his penny, and go out.\r\n\r\n"Beginnin\' early in the mornin\'!" observed one customer.\r\n\r\nThe barber laughed. "Yes," he said. "He wants to get a proper bust on\r\nbefore he goes to bed, I s\'pose."\r\n\r\nSamuel Greer\'s chin being smooth at last, he rose and turned to where\r\nhe had hung his hat. His jaw dropped, and his eyes almost sprang out to\r\nmeet each other as he saw--a bare peg! The unsteady customer had walked\r\noff with the wrong hat--his hat, and--the paper concealed inside!\r\n\r\n"Lor!" cried the dismayed Greer, "he\'s took my hat!"\r\n\r\nAll the shopful of men set up a guffaw at this. "Take \'is then," said\r\none. "It\'s a blame sight better one than yourn!"\r\n\r\nBut Greer, without a hat, rushed into the street, and the barber,\r\nwithout his penny, rushed after him. "Stop \'im!" shouted Greer\r\ndistractedly. "Stop thief!"\r\n\r\nThus it was that Dorrington, at this time of a far less well-groomed\r\nappearance than was his later wont, watching outside the barber\'s,\r\nobserved the mad bursting forth of Greer, followed by the barber. After\r\nthe barber came the customers, one grinning furiously beneath a coating\r\nof lather.\r\n\r\n"Stop \'im!" cried Greer. "\'E\'s got my \'at! Stop \'im!"\r\n\r\n"You pay me my money," said the barber, catching his arm. "Never mind\r\nyer \'at--you can \'ave \'is. But just you pay me first."\r\n\r\n"Leave go! You\'re responsible for lettin\' \'im take it, I tell you! It\'s\r\na special \'at--valuable; leave go!"\r\n\r\nDorrington stayed to hear no more. Three minutes before he had observed\r\na slightly elevated navvy emerge from the shop and walk solemnly\r\nacross the street under a hat manifestly a size or two too small for\r\nhim. Now Dorrington darted down the turning which the man had taken.\r\nThe hat was a wretched thing, and there must be some special reason\r\nfor Greer\'s wild anxiety to recover it, especially as the navvy must\r\nhave left another, probably better, behind him. Already Dorrington had\r\nconjectured that Greer was carrying the codicil about with him, for he\r\nhad no place else to hide it, and he would scarcely have offered so\r\nconfidently to negotiate over it if it had been in the Bermondsey Wall\r\nhouse, well in reach of Paul Cater. So he followed the elevated navvy\r\nwith all haste. He might never have seen him again were it not that the\r\nunconscious bearer of the fortunes of Flint (and, indeed, Dorrington)\r\nhesitated for a little while whether or not to enter the door of a\r\npublic-house near St. Saviour\'s Dock. In the end he decided to go on,\r\nand it was just as he had started that Dorrington sighted him again.\r\n\r\nThe navvy walked slowly and gravely on, now and again with a swerve\r\nto the wall or the curb, but generally with a careful and laboured\r\ndirectness. Presently he arrived at a dock-bridge, with a low iron\r\nrail. An incoming barge attracted his eye, and he stopped and solemnly\r\ninspected it. He leaned on the low rail for this purpose, and as he did\r\nso the hat, all too small, fell off. Had he been standing two yards\r\nnearer the centre of the bridge it would have dropped into the water.\r\nAs it was it fell on the quay, a few feet from the edge, and a dockman,\r\ncoming toward the steps by the bridge-side, picked it up and brought it\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n"Here y\'are, mate," said the dockman, offering the hat.\r\n\r\nThe navvy took it in lofty silence, and inspected it narrowly. Then he\r\nsaid, "\'Ere--wot\'s this? This ain\'t my \'at!" And he glared suspiciously\r\nat the dockman.\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t it?" answered the dockman carelessly.\r\n\r\n"Aw right then, keep it for the bloke it b\'longs to. I don\'t want it."\r\n\r\n"No," returned the navvy with rising indignation, "but I want mine,\r\nthough! Wotcher done with it? Eh? It ain\'t a rotten old \'un like this\r\n\'ere. None o\' yer \'alf-larks. Jist you \'and it over, come on!"\r\n\r\n"\'And wot over?" asked the dockman, growing indignant in his turn. "You\r\ndrops yer \'at over the bridge like some kid as can\'t take care of it,\r\nand I brings it up for ye. \'Stead o\' sayin\' thank ye, \'like a man, y\'\r\nasks me for another \'at! Go an\' bile yer face!" And he turned on his\r\nheel.\r\n\r\n"No, ye don\'t!" bawled the navvy, dropping the battered hat and making\r\na complicated rush at the other\'s retreating form. "Not much! You gimme\r\nmy \'at!" And he grabbed the dockman anywhere, with both hands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "A MINGLED BUNCH OF DOCKMAN AND NAVVY WAS FLOUNDERING\r\nABOUT THE STREET."]\r\n\r\nThe dockman was as big as the navvy, and no more patient. He\r\nimmediately punched his assailant\'s nose; and in three seconds a\r\nmingled bunch of dockman and navvy was floundering about the street.\r\nDorrington saw no more. He had the despised hat in his hand, and,\r\ngeneral attention being directed to the action in progress, he hurried\r\nquietly up the nearest court.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nSamuel Greer, having got clear of the barber by paying his penny, was\r\nin much perplexity, and this notwithstanding his acquisition of the\r\nnavvy\'s hat, a very decent bowler, which covered his head generously\r\nand rested on his ears. What should be the move now? His hat was clean\r\ngone, and the codicil with it. To find it again would be a hopeless\r\ntask, unless by chance the navvy should discover his mistake and return\r\nto the barber\'s to make a rectification of hats. So Samuel Greer\r\nreturned once more to the barber\'s, and for the rest of the day called\r\nagain and again fruitlessly. At first the barber was vastly amused, and\r\ntold the story to his customers, who laughed. Then the barber got angry\r\nat the continual worrying, and at the close of the day\'s barbering he\r\nearned his night\'s repose by pitching Samuel Greer neck and crop into\r\nthe gutter. Samuel Greer gathered himself up disconsolately, surrounded\r\nhis head with the navvy\'s hat, and shuffled off to the "Ship and\r\nAnchor."\r\n\r\nAt the "Ship and Anchor" he found one Barker, a decayed and sodden\r\nlawyer\'s clerk out of work. Greer\'s temporary affluence enabling\r\nhim to stand drinks, he was presently able, by putting artfully\r\nhypothetical cases, to extract certain legal information from Barker.\r\nChiefly he learned that if a will or a codicil were missing, it might\r\nnevertheless be possible to obtain probate of it by satisfying the\r\ncourt with evidence of its contents and its genuineness. Here, at any\r\nrate, was a certain hope. He alone, apparently, of all persons, knew\r\nthe contents of the codicil and the names of the witnesses; and since\r\nit was impossible to sell the codicil, now that it was gone, he might\r\nat least sell his evidence. He resolved to offer his evidence for sale\r\nto Flint at once, and take what he could get. There must be no delay,\r\nfor possibly the navvy might find the paper in the hat and carry it to\r\nFlint, seeing that his name was beneficially mentioned in it, and his\r\naddress given. Plainly the hat would not go back to the barber\'s now.\r\nIf the drunken navvy had found out his mistake he probably had not the\r\nleast notion where he had been nor where the hat had come from, else he\r\nwould have returned it during the day, and recovered his own superior\r\nproperty. So Samuel Greer went at once, late as it was, and knocked up\r\nMr. Flint.\r\n\r\nFlint congratulated himself, feeling sure that Greer had thought better\r\nof his business and had come to give his information for anything he\r\ncould get. Greer, on his part, was careful to conceal the fact that the\r\ncodicil had been in his possession and had been lost. All he said was\r\nthat he had seen the codicil, that its date was nine months later than\r\nthat of the will, and that it benefited Jarvis Flint to the extent of\r\nsome ten thousand pounds; leaving Flint to suppose, if he pleased, that\r\nCater, the executor, had the codicil, but would probably suppress it.\r\nIndeed this was the conclusion that Flint immediately jumped at.\r\n\r\nAnd the result of the interview was this: Flint, with much grudging and\r\nreluctance, handed over as a preliminary fee the sum of one pound, the\r\nmost he could be screwed up to. Then it was settled that Greer should\r\ncome on the morrow and consult with Flint and his solicitor Lugg, the\r\nobject of the consultation being the construction of a consistent tale\r\nand a satisfactory _soi-disant_ copy of the codicil, which Greer was\r\nto swear to, if necessary, and armed with which Paul Cater might be\r\nconfronted and brought to terms.\r\n\r\nIt may be wondered why, ere this, Flint had not received the genuine\r\ncodicil itself, recovered by Dorrington from Greer\'s hat. The fact was\r\nthat Dorrington, as was his wont, was playing a little game of his own.\r\nHaving possessed himself of the codicil, he was now in a position to\r\nmake the most from both sides, and in a far more efficient manner than\r\nthe clumsy Greer. People of Jarvis Flint\'s sordid character are apt,\r\nwith all their sordid keenness, to be wonderfully short-sighted in\r\nregard to what might seem fairly obvious to a man of honest judgment.\r\nThus it never occurred to Flint that a man like Dorrington, willing,\r\nfor a miserable wage, to apply his exceptional subtlety to the\r\nfurtherance of his employer\'s rascally designs, would be at least as\r\nready to swindle that master on his own account when the opportunity\r\noffered; would be, in fact, the more ready, in proportion to the\r\nstinginess wherewith his master had treated him.\r\n\r\nHaving found the codicil, Dorrington\'s procedure was not to hand it\r\nover forthwith to Flint. It was this: first he made a careful and exact\r\ncopy of the codicil; then he procured two men of his acquaintance, men\r\nof good credit, to read over the copy, word for word, and certify it\r\nas being an exact copy of the original by way of a signed declaration\r\nwritten on the back of the copy. Then he was armed at all points.\r\n\r\nHe packed the copy carefully away in his pocket-book, and with the\r\noriginal in his coat pocket, he called at the house in Bermondsey\r\nWall, where Paul Cater had taken up his quarters to keep guard over\r\neverything till the will should be proved. So it happened that, while\r\nSamuel Greer, Jarvis Flint, and Lugg, the lawyer, were building their\r\nscheme, Dorrington was talking to Paul Cater at Cater\'s Wharf.\r\n\r\nOn the assurance that he had business of extreme importance, Cater\r\ntook Dorrington into the room in which the old man had died. Cater\r\nwas using this room as an office in which to examine and balance his\r\nuncle\'s books, and the corpse had been carried to a room below to await\r\nthe funeral. Dorrington\'s clothes at this time, as I have hinted,\r\nwere not distinguished by the excellence of cut and condition that\r\nwas afterwards noticeable; in point of fact, he was seedy. But his\r\nassurance and his presence of mind were fully developed, and it was\r\nthis very transaction that was to put the elegant appearance within\r\nhis reach.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Cater," he said, "I believe you are sole executor of the will\r\nof your uncle, Mr. Jeremiah Cater, who lived in this house." Cater\r\nassented.\r\n\r\n"That will is one extremely favourable to yourself. In fact, by it you\r\nbecome not only sole executor, but practically sole legatee."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"I am here as a man of business and as a man of the world to give you\r\ncertain information. There is a codicil to that will."\r\n\r\nCater started. Then he shrugged his shoulders and shook his head as\r\nthough he knew better.\r\n\r\n"There is a codicil," Dorrington went on, imperturbably, "executed\r\nin strict form, all in the handwriting of the testator, and dated\r\nnine months later than the will. That codicil benefits your cousin,\r\nMr. Jarvis Flint, to the extent of ten thousand pounds. To put it in\r\nanother way, it deprives _you_ of ten thousand pounds."\r\n\r\nCater felt uneasy, but he did his best to maintain a contemptuous\r\nappearance. "You\'re rushing ahead pretty fast," he said, "talking about\r\nthe terms of this codicil, as you call it. What I want to know is,\r\nwhere is it?"\r\n\r\n"That," replied Dorrington, smilingly, "is a question very easily\r\nanswered. The codicil is in my pocket." He tapped his coat as he spoke.\r\n\r\nPaul Cater started again, and now he was plainly discomposed. "Very\r\nwell," he said, with some bravado, "if you\'ve got it you can show it to\r\nme, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Nothing easier," Dorrington responded affably. He stepped to the\r\nfireplace and took the poker. "You won\'t mind my holding the poker\r\nwhile you inspect the paper, will you?" he asked politely. "The fact\r\nis, the codicil is of such a nature that I fear a man of your sharp\r\nbusiness instincts might be tempted to destroy it, there being no other\r\nwitness present, unless you had the assurance (which I now give you)\r\nthat if you as much as touch it I shall stun you with the poker. There\r\nis the codicil, which you may read with your hands behind you." He\r\nspread the paper out on the table, and Cater bent eagerly and read it,\r\ngrowing paler as his eye travelled down the sheet.\r\n\r\nBefore raising his eyes, however, he collected himself, and as he stood\r\nup he said, with affected contempt, "I don\'t care a brass farthing for\r\nthis thing! It\'s a forgery on the face of it."\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" answered Dorrington placidly, recovering the paper and\r\nfolding it up; "that\'s very disappointing to hear. I must take it round\r\nto Mr. Flint and see if that is his opinion."\r\n\r\n"No, you mustn\'t!" exclaimed Cater, desperately. "You say that\'s a\r\ngenuine document. Very well. I\'m still executor, and you are bound to\r\ngive it to me."\r\n\r\n"Precisely," Dorrington replied sweetly. "But in the strict interests\r\nof justice I think Mr. Flint, as the person interested, ought to have\r\na look at it first, _in case_ any accident should happen to it in your\r\nhands. Don\'t you?"\r\n\r\nCater knew he was in a corner, and his face betrayed it.\r\n\r\n"Come," said Dorrington in a more business-like tone. "Here is the\r\ncase in a nutshell. It is my business, just as it is yours, to get as\r\nmuch as I can for nothing. In pursuance of that business I quietly got\r\nhold of this codicil. Nobody but yourself knows I have it, and as to\r\n_how_ I got it you needn\'t ask, for I sha\'n\'t tell you. Here is the\r\ndocument, and it is worth ten thousand pounds to either of two people,\r\nyourself and Mr. Flint, your worthy cousin. I am prepared to sell it\r\nat a very great sacrifice--to sell it dirt cheap, in fact, and I give\r\nyou the privilege of first refusal, for which you ought to be grateful.\r\nOne thousand pounds is the price, and that gives you a profit of nine\r\nthousand pounds when you have destroyed the codicil--a noble profit of\r\nnine hundred per cent. at a stroke! Come, is it a bargain?"\r\n\r\n"What?" ejaculated Cater, astounded. "A thousand pounds?"\r\n\r\n"One thousand pounds exactly," replied Dorrington complacently, "and a\r\npenny for the receipt stamp--if you want a receipt."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Cater, "you\'re mad. A thousand pounds! Why, it\'s absurd!"\r\n\r\n"Think so?" remarked Dorrington, reaching for his hat. "Then I must see\r\nif Mr. Flint agrees with you, that\'s all. He\'s a man of business, and\r\nI never heard of his refusing a certain nine hundred per cent. profit\r\nyet. Good-day!"\r\n\r\n"No, stop!" yelled the desperate Cater. "Don\'t go. Don\'t be\r\nunreasonable now--say five hundred and I\'ll write you a cheque."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t do," answered Dorrington, shaking his head. "A thousand is the\r\nprice, and not a penny less. And not by cheque, mind. I understand\r\nall moves of that sort. Notes or gold. I wonder at a smart man like\r\nyourself expecting me to be so green."\r\n\r\n"But I haven\'t the money here."\r\n\r\n"Very likely not. Where\'s your bank? We\'ll go there and get it."\r\n\r\nCater, between his avarice and his fears, was at his wits\' end. "Don\'t\r\nbe so hard on me, Mr. Dorrington," he whined. "I\'m not a rich man, I\r\nassure you. You\'ll ruin me!"\r\n\r\n"Ruin you? What _do_ you mean? I give you ten thousand pounds for one\r\nthousand and you say I ruin you! Really, it seems too ridiculously\r\ncheap. If you don\'t settle quickly, Mr. Cater, I shall raise my terms,\r\nI warn you!"\r\n\r\nSo it came about that Dorrington and Cater took cab together for a\r\nbranch bank in Pimlico, whence Dorrington emerged with one thousand\r\npounds in notes and gold, stowed carefully about his person, and Cater\r\nwith the codicil to his uncle\'s will, which half an hour later he had\r\nsafely burnt.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nSo much for the first half of Dorrington\'s operation. For the second\r\nhalf he made no immediate hurry. If he had been aware of Samuel\r\nGreer\'s movements and Lugg\'s little plot he might have hurried, but as\r\nit was he busied himself in setting up on a more respectable scale by\r\nhelp of his newly-acquired money. But he did not long delay. He had the\r\nattested copy of the codicil, which would be as good as the original if\r\nproperly backed with evidence in a court of law. The astute Cater, wise\r\nin his own conceit, just as was his equally astute cousin Flint, had\r\nclean overlooked the possibility of such a trick as this. And now all\r\nDorrington had to do was to sell the copy for one more thousand pounds\r\nto Jarvis Flint.\r\n\r\nIt was on the morning of old Jerry Cater\'s funeral that he made his\r\nway to Deptford to do this, and he chuckled as he reflected on the\r\nprobable surprise of Flint, who doubtless wondered what had become of\r\nhis sweated inquiry agent, when confronted with his offer. But when\r\nhe arrived at the ship-store shop he found that Flint was out, so he\r\nresolved to call again in the evening.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Jarvis Flint, Samuel Greer, and Lugg the lawyer were at\r\nthe house in Bermondsey Wall attacking Paul Cater. Greer, foreseeing\r\nprobable defiance by Cater from a window, had led the party in by the\r\nwharf door and so had taken Cater by surprise. Cater was in a suit of\r\ndecent black, as befitted the occasion, and he received the news of the\r\nexistence of a copy of the codicil he had destroyed with equal fury and\r\napprehension.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" he demanded. "What do you mean? I\'m not to be\r\nbluffed like this! You talk about a codicil--where is it? Where is it,\r\neh?"\r\n\r\n"My dear sir," said Lugg peaceably--he was a small, snuffy man--"we are\r\nnot here to make disturbances or quarrels, or breaches of the peace; we\r\nare here on a strictly business errand, and I assure you it will be for\r\nyour best interests if you listen quietly to what we have to say. Ahem!\r\nIt seems that Mr. Samuel Greer here has frequently seen the codicil----"\r\n\r\n"Greer\'s a rascal--a thief--a scoundrel!" cried the irate Cater,\r\nshaking his fist in the thick of Greer\'s squint. "He swindled me out of\r\nten pounds! He----"\r\n\r\n"Really, Mr. Cater," Lugg interposed, "you do no good by such\r\noutbursts, and you prevent my putting the case before you. As I was\r\nsaying, Mr. Greer has frequently seen the codicil, and saw it, indeed,\r\non the very day of the late Mr. Cater\'s decease. You may not have\r\ncome across it, and, indeed, there may be some temporary difficulty\r\nin finding the original. But fortunately Mr. Greer took notes of the\r\ncontents and of the witnesses\' names, and from those notes I have\r\nbeen able to draw up this statement, which Mr. Greer is prepared to\r\nsubscribe to, by affidavit or declaration, if by any chance you may be\r\nunable to produce the original codicil."\r\n\r\nCater, seeing his thousand pounds to Dorrington going for nothing, and\r\nnow confronted with the fear of losing ten thousand pounds more, could\r\nscarce speak for rage. "Greer\'s a liar, I tell you!" he spluttered\r\nout. "A liar, a thief, a scoundrel! His word--his affidavit--his\r\noath--anything of his--isn\'t worth a straw!"\r\n\r\n"That, my dear sir," Lugg proceeded equably, "is a thing that may\r\nremain for the probate court, and possibly a jury, to decide upon.\r\nIn the meantime permit me to suggest that it will be better for all\r\nparties--cheaper in fact--if this matter be settled out of court. I\r\nthink, if you will give the matter a little calm and unbiassed thought,\r\nyou will admit that the balance of strength is altogether with our\r\ncase. Would you like to look at the statement? Its effect, you will\r\nsee, is, roughly speaking, to give my client a legacy of say about\r\nten thousand pounds in value. The witnesses are easily produced, and\r\nreally, I must say, for my part, if Mr. Greer, who has nothing to gain\r\nor lose either way, is prepared to take the serious responsibility of\r\nswearing a declaration----"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe he will!" cried Cater, catching at the straw. "I don\'t\r\nbelieve he will. Mind, Greer," he went on, "there\'s penal servitude for\r\nperjury!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," Greer answered, speaking for the first time, with a squint and a\r\nchuckle, "so there is. And for stealin\' an\' suppressin\' dockyments, I\'m\r\ntold. I\'m ready to make that \'ere declaration."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe he is!" Cater said, with an attempt to affect\r\nindifference. "And anyhow, I needn\'t take any notice of it till he\r\ndoes."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Lugg accommodatingly, "there need be no difficulty\r\nor delay about that. The declaration\'s all written out, and I\'m a\r\ncommissioner to administer oaths. I think that\'s a Bible I see on the\r\nshelf there, isn\'t it?" He stepped across to where the old Bible had\r\nlain since Greer flung it there, just before Jerry Cater\'s death. He\r\ntook the book down and opened it at the title-page. "Yes," he said, "a\r\nBible; and now--why--what? what?"\r\n\r\nMr. Lugg stood suddenly still and stared at the fly-leaf. Then he said\r\nquietly, "Let me see, it was on Monday last that Mr. Cater died, was it\r\nnot?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Late in the afternoon?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Then, gentlemen, you must please prepare yourselves for a surprise.\r\nMr. Cater evidently made another will, revoking all previous wills and\r\ncodicils, on the very day of his death. And here it is!" He extended\r\nthe Bible before him, and it was plain to see that the fly-leaf was\r\ncovered with the weak, straggling handwriting of old Jerry Cater--a\r\nlittle weaker and a little more straggling than that in the other will,\r\nbut unmistakably his.\r\n\r\nFlint stared, perplexed and bewildered, Greer scratched his head and\r\nsquinted blankly at the lawyer. Paul Cater passed his hand across his\r\nforehead and seized a tuft of hair over one temple as though he would\r\npull it out. The only book in the house that he had not opened or\r\nlooked at during his stay was the Bible.\r\n\r\n"The thing is very short," Lugg went on, inclining the writing to the\r\nlight. "\'_This is the last will and testament of me, Jeremiah Cater, of\r\nCater\'s Wharf. I give and bequeath the whole of the estate and property\r\nof which I may die possessed, whether real or personal, entirely and\r\nabsolutely to--to--_\' what is the name? Oh yes--\'_to Henry Sinclair, my\r\nclerk----_\'"\r\n\r\n"What?" yelled Cater and Flint in chorus, each rising and clutching at\r\nthe Bible. "Not Sinclair! No! Let me see!"\r\n\r\n"I think, gentlemen," said the solicitor, putting their hands aside,\r\n"that you will get the information quickest by listening while I\r\nread. \'_----to Henry Sinclair, my clerk. And I appoint the said Henry\r\nSinclair my sole executor. And I wish it to be known that I do this,\r\nnot only by way of reward to an honest servant, and to recompense him\r\nfor his loss in loan transactions with me, but also to mark my sense\r\nof the neglect of my two nephews. And I revoke all former wills and\r\ncodicils._\' Then follows date and signature and the signatures of\r\nwitnesses--both apparently men of imperfect education."\r\n\r\n"But you\'re mad--it\'s impossible!" exclaimed Cater, the first to find\r\nhis tongue. "He _couldn\'t_ have made a will then--he was too weak.\r\nGreer knows he couldn\'t."\r\n\r\nGreer, who understood better than anybody else present the allusion in\r\nthe will to the nephews\' neglect, coughed dubiously, and said, "Well,\r\nhe did get up while I was out. An\' when I got back he had the Bible\r\nbeside him, an\' he seemed pretty well knocked up with something. An\'\r\nthe winder was wide open--I expect he opened it to holler out as well\r\nas he could to some chaps on the wharf or somewhere to come up by the\r\nwharf door and do the witnessing. An\' now I think of it I expect he\r\nsent me out a-purpose in case--well, in case if I knowed I might get up\r\nto summat with the will. He told me not to hurry. An\' I expect he about\r\nused himself up with the writin\' an\' the hollerin\' an\' the cold air an\'\r\nwhat not."\r\n\r\nCater and Flint, greatly abashed, exchanged a rapid glance. Then Cater,\r\nwith a preliminary cough, said hesitatingly, "Well now, Mr. Lugg, let\r\nus consider this. It seems quite evident to me--and no doubt it will\r\nto you, as my cousin\'s solicitor--it seems quite evident to me that\r\nmy poor uncle could not have been in a sound state of mind when he\r\nmade this very ridiculous will. Quite apart from all questions of\r\ngenuineness, I\'ve no doubt that a court would set it aside. And in\r\nview of that it would be very cruel to allow this poor man Sinclair\r\nto suppose himself to be entitled to a great deal of money, only to\r\nfind himself disappointed and ruined after all. You\'ll agree with\r\nthat, I\'m sure. So I think it will be best for all parties if we keep\r\nthis thing to ourselves, and just tear out that fly-leaf and burn it,\r\nto save trouble. And on my part I shall be glad to admit the copy of\r\nthe codicil you have produced, and no doubt my cousin and I will be\r\nprepared to pay you a fee which will compensate you for any loss of\r\nbusiness in actions--eh?"\r\n\r\nMr. Lugg was tempted, but he was no fool. Here was Samuel Greer at\r\nhis elbow knowing everything, and without a doubt, no matter how well\r\nbribed, always ready to make more money by betraying the arrangement\r\nto Sinclair. And that would mean inevitable ruin to Lugg himself, and\r\nprobably a dose of gaol. So he shook his head virtuously and said,\r\n"I couldn\'t think of anything of the sort, Mr. Cater, not for an\r\ninstant. I am a solicitor, and I have my strict duties. It is my duty\r\nimmediately to place this will in the hands of Mr. Henry Sinclair, as\r\nsole executor. I wish you a good-day, gentlemen."\r\n\r\nAnd so it was that old Jerry Cater\'s money came at last to Sinclair.\r\nAnd the result was a joyful one, not only for Sinclair and his wife,\r\nbut also for a number of poor debtors whose "paper" was part of the\r\nproperty. For Sinclair knew the plight of these wretches by personal\r\nexperience, and was merciful, as neither Flint nor Paul Cater would\r\nhave been. The two witnesses to the Bible will turned out to be\r\nbargemen. They had been mightily surprised to be hailed from Jerry\r\nCater\'s window by the old man himself, already looking like a corpse.\r\nThey had come up, however, at his request, and had witnessed the will,\r\nthough neither knew anything of its contents. But they were ready to\r\ntestify that it was written in a Bible, that they saw Cater sign it,\r\nand that the attesting signatures were theirs. They had helped the old\r\nman back into bed, and next day they heard that he was dead.\r\n\r\nAs for Dorrington, he had a thousand pounds to set him up in a\r\ngentlemanly line of business and villainy. Ignorant of what had\r\nhappened, he attempted to tap Flint for another thousand pounds as he\r\nhad designed, but was met with revilings and an explanation. Seeing\r\nthat the game was finished, Dorrington laughed at both the cousins and\r\nturned his attention to his next case.\r\n\r\nAnd old Jerry Cater\'s funeral was attended, as nobody would have\r\nexpected, by two very genuine mourners--Paul Cater and Jarvis Flint.\r\nBut they mourned, not the old man, but his lost fortune, and Paul Cater\r\nalso mourned a sum of one thousand and ten pounds of his own. They had\r\nfollowed Lugg to the door when he walked off with the Bible in hope\r\nto persuade him, but he saw a wealthy client in prospect in Mr. Henry\r\nSinclair, and would not allow his virtue to be shaken.\r\n\r\nSamuel Greer walked away from the old house in moody case. Plainly\r\nthere were no more pickings available from old Jerry Cater\'s wills\r\nand codicils. As he trudged by St. Saviour\'s Dock he was suddenly\r\nconfronted by a large navvy with a black eye. The navvy stooped and\r\ninspected a peacock\'s feather-eye that adorned the band of the hat\r\nGreer was wearing. Then he calmly grabbed and inspected the hat\r\nitself, inside and outside. "Why, blow me if this ain\'t my \'at!" said\r\nthe navvy. "Take that, ye dirty squintin\' thief! And that too!

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org Section 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\r\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\r\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\r\nlocations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
