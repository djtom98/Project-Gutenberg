Like "Roderick"\r\nand like "_The American_," it had been designed for publication in "_The\r\nAtlantic Monthly_," where it began to appear in 1880. It differed from\r\nits two predecessors, however, in finding a course also open to it, from\r\nmonth to month, in "_Macmillan\'s Magazine_"; which was to be for me one of\r\nthe last occasions of simultaneous "serialisation" in the two countries\r\nthat the changing conditions of literary intercourse between England and\r\nthe United States had up to then left unaltered. It is a long novel, and\r\nI was long in writing it; I remember being again much occupied with it,\r\nthe following year, during a stay of several weeks made in Venice. I had\r\nrooms on Riva Schiavoni, at the top of a house near the passage leading\r\noff to San Zaccaria; the waterside life, the wondrous lagoon spread\r\nbefore me, and the ceaseless human chatter of Venice came in at my\r\nwindows, to which I seem to myself to have been constantly driven, in\r\nthe fruitless fidget of composition, as if to see whether, out in the\r\nblue channel, the ship of some right suggestion, of some better phrase,\r\nof the next happy twist of my subject, the next true touch for my\r\ncanvas, mightn\'t come into sight. But I recall vividly enough that the\r\nresponse most elicited, in general, to these restless appeals was the\r\nrather grim admonition that romantic and historic sites, such as\r\nthe land of Italy abounds in, offer the artist a questionable aid to\r\nconcentration when they themselves are not to be the subject of it. They\r\nare too rich in their own life and too charged with their own meanings\r\nmerely to help him out with a lame phrase; they draw him away from his\r\nsmall question to their own greater ones; so that, after a little, he\r\nfeels, while thus yearning toward them in his difficulty, as if he were\r\nasking an army of glorious veterans to help him to arrest a peddler who\r\nhas given him the wrong change.\r\n\r\nThere are pages of the book which, in the reading over, have seemed\r\nto make me see again the bristling curve of the wide Riva, the large\r\ncolour-spots of the balconied houses and the repeated undulation of the\r\nlittle hunchbacked bridges, marked by the rise and drop again, with the\r\nwave, of foreshortened clicking pedestrians. The Venetian footfall and\r\nthe Venetian cry--all talk there, wherever uttered, having the pitch of\r\na call across the water--come in once more at the window, renewing one\'s\r\nold impression of the delighted senses and the divided, frustrated mind.\r\nHow can places that speak <i>in general</i> so to the imagination not give\r\nit, at the moment, the particular thing it wants? I recollect again\r\nand again, in beautiful places, dropping into that wonderment. The\r\nreal truth is, I think, that they express, under this appeal, only too\r\nmuch--more than, in the given case, one has use for; so that one\r\nfinds one\'s self working less congruously, after all, so far as the\r\nsurrounding picture is concerned, than in presence of the moderate and\r\nthe neutral, to which we may lend something of the light of our vision.\r\nSuch a place as Venice is too proud for such charities; Venice doesn\'t\r\nborrow, she but all magnificently gives. We profit by that enormously,\r\nbut to do so we must either be quite off duty or be on it in her service\r\nalone. Such, and so rueful, are these reminiscences; though on the\r\nwhole, no doubt, one\'s book, and one\'s "literary effort" at large, were\r\nto be the better for them. Strangely fertilising, in the long run, does\r\na wasted effort of attention often prove. It all depends on _how_ the\r\nattention has been cheated, has been squandered. There are high-handed\r\ninsolent frauds, and there are insidious sneaking ones. And there is,\r\nI fear, even on the most designing artist\'s part, always witless enough\r\ngood faith, always anxious enough desire, to fail to guard him against\r\ntheir deceits.\r\n\r\nTrying to recover here, for recognition, the germ of my idea, I see that\r\nit must have consisted not at all in any conceit of a "plot," nefarious\r\nname, in any flash, upon the fancy, of a set of relations, or in any one\r\nof those situations that, by a logic of their own, immediately fall, for\r\nthe fabulist, into movement, into a march or a rush, a patter of quick\r\nsteps; but altogether in the sense of a single character, the character\r\nand aspect of a particular engaging young woman, to which all the usual\r\nelements of a "subject," certainly of a setting, were to need to be\r\nsuper added. Quite as interesting as the young woman herself at her\r\nbest, do I find, I must again repeat, this projection of memory upon the\r\nwhole matter of the growth, in one\'s imagination, of some such apology\r\nfor a motive. These are the fascinations of the fabulist\'s art, these\r\nlurking forces of expansion, these necessities of upspringing in\r\nthe seed, these beautiful determinations, on the part of the idea\r\nentertained, to grow as tall as possible, to push into the light and\r\nthe air and thickly flower there; and, quite as much, these fine\r\npossibilities of recovering, from some good standpoint on the ground\r\ngained, the intimate history of the business--of retracing and\r\nreconstructing its steps and stages. I have always fondly remembered a\r\nremark that I heard fall years ago from the lips of Ivan Turgenieff in\r\nregard to his own experience of the usual origin of the fictive picture.\r\nIt began for him almost always with the vision of some person or\r\npersons, who hovered before him, soliciting him, as the active or\r\npassive figure, interesting him and appealing to him just as they were\r\nand by what they were. He saw them, in that fashion, as disponibles,\r\nsaw them subject to the chances, the complications of existence, and saw\r\nthem vividly, but then had to find for them the right relations, those\r\nthat would most bring them out; to imagine, to invent and select and\r\npiece together the situations most useful and favourable to the sense of\r\nthe creatures themselves, the complications they would be most likely to\r\nproduce and to feel.\r\n\r\n"To arrive at these things is to arrive at my story," he said, "and\r\nthat\'s the way I look for it. The result is that I\'m often accused\r\nof not having \'story\' enough. I seem to myself to have as much as I\r\nneed--to show my people, to exhibit their relations with each other;\r\nfor that is all my measure. If I watch them long enough I see them come\r\ntogether, I see them _placed_, I see them engaged in this or that act and\r\nin this or that difficulty. How they look and move and speak and behave,\r\nalways in the setting I have found for them, is my account of them--of\r\nwhich I dare say, alas, _que cela manque souvent d\'architecture_. But I\r\nwould rather, I think, have too little architecture than too much--when\r\nthere\'s danger of its interfering with my measure of the truth. The\r\nFrench of course like more of it than I give--having by their own genius\r\nsuch a hand for it; and indeed one must give all one can. As for the\r\norigin of one\'s wind-blown germs themselves, who shall say, as you ask,\r\nwhere _they_ come from? We have to go too far back, too far behind,\r\nto say. Isn\'t it all we can say that they come from every quarter\r\nof heaven, that they are _there_ at almost any turn of the road? They\r\naccumulate, and we are always picking them over, selecting among them.\r\nThey are the breath of life--by which I mean that life, in its own\r\nway, breathes them upon us. They are so, in a manner prescribed and\r\nimposed--floated into our minds by the current of life. That reduces to\r\nimbecility the vain critic\'s quarrel, so often, with one\'s subject, when\r\nhe hasn\'t the wit to accept it. Will he point out then which other it\r\nshould properly have been?--his office being, essentially to point out.\r\n_Il en serait bien embarrass\xe9_. Ah, when he points out what I\'ve done or\r\nfailed to do with it, that\'s another matter: there he\'s on his ground. I\r\ngive him up my \'sarchitecture,\'" my distinguished friend concluded, "as\r\nmuch as he will."\r\n\r\nSo this beautiful genius, and I recall with comfort the gratitude I drew\r\nfrom his reference to the intensity of suggestion that may reside in the\r\nstray figure, the unattached character, the image _en disponibilit\xe9_.\r\nIt gave me higher warrant than I seemed then to have met for just\r\nthat blest habit of one\'s own imagination, the trick of investing some\r\nconceived or encountered individual, some brace or group of individuals,\r\nwith the germinal property and authority. I was myself so much more\r\nantecedently conscious of my figures than of their setting--a too\r\npreliminary, a preferential interest in which struck me as in general\r\nsuch a putting of the cart before the horse. I might envy, though I\r\ncouldn\'t emulate, the imaginative writer so constituted as to see his\r\nfable first and to make out its agents afterwards. I could think so\r\nlittle of any fable that didn\'t need its agents positively to launch\r\nit; I could think so little of any situation that didn\'t depend for its\r\ninterest on the nature of the persons situated, and thereby on their\r\nway of taking it. There are methods of so-called presentation, I believe\r\namong novelists who have appeared to flourish--that offer the situation\r\nas indifferent to that support; but I have not lost the sense of the\r\nvalue for me, at the time, of the admirable Russian\'s testimony to my\r\nnot needing, all superstitiously, to try and perform any such gymnastic.\r\nOther echoes from the same source linger with me, I confess, as\r\nunfadingly--if it be not all indeed one much-embracing echo. It was\r\nimpossible after that not to read, for one\'s uses, high lucidity into\r\nthe tormented and disfigured and bemuddled question of the objective\r\nvalue, and even quite into that of the critical appreciation, of\r\n"subject" in the novel.\r\n\r\nOne had had from an early time, for that matter, the instinct of the\r\nright estimate of such values and of its reducing to the inane the\r\ndull dispute over the "immoral" subject and the moral. Recognising so\r\npromptly the one measure of the worth of a given subject, the question\r\nabout it that, rightly answered, disposes of all others--is it valid,\r\nin a word, is it genuine, is it sincere, the result of some direct\r\nimpression or perception of life?--I had found small edification,\r\nmostly, in a critical pretension that had neglected from the first\r\nall delimitation of ground and all definition of terms. The air of\r\nmy earlier time shows, to memory, as darkened, all round, with that\r\nvanity--unless the difference to-day be just in one\'s own final\r\nimpatience, the lapse of one\'s attention. There is, I think, no more\r\nnutritive or suggestive truth in this connexion than that of the perfect\r\ndependence of the "moral" sense of a work of art on the amount of felt\r\nlife concerned in producing it. The question comes back thus, obviously,\r\nto the kind and the degree of the artist\'s prime sensibility, which is\r\nthe soil out of which his subject springs. The quality and capacity of\r\nthat soil, its ability to "grow" with due freshness and straightness any\r\nvision of life, represents, strongly or weakly, the projected morality.\r\nThat element is but another name for the more or less close connexion of\r\nthe subject with some mark made on the intelligence, with some sincere\r\nexperience. By which, at the same time, of course, one is far from\r\ncontending that this enveloping air of the artist\'s humanity--which\r\ngives the last touch to the worth of the work--is not a widely and\r\nwondrously varying element; being on one occasion a rich and magnificent\r\nmedium and on another a comparatively poor and ungenerous one. Here we\r\nget exactly the high price of the novel as a literary form--its power\r\nnot only, while preserving that form with closeness, to range\r\nthrough all the differences of the individual relation to its general\r\nsubject-matter, all the varieties of outlook on life, of disposition to\r\nreflect and project, created by conditions that are never the same from\r\nman to man (or, so far as that goes, from man to woman), but positively\r\nto appear more true to its character in proportion as it strains, or\r\ntends to burst, with a latent extravagance, its mould.\r\n\r\nThe house of fiction has in short not one window, but a million--a\r\nnumber of possible windows not to be reckoned, rather; every one of\r\nwhich has been pierced, or is still pierceable, in its vast front, by\r\nthe need of the individual vision and by the pressure of the individual\r\nwill. These apertures, of dissimilar shape and size, hang so, all\r\ntogether, over the human scene that we might have expected of them a\r\ngreater sameness of report than we find. They are but windows at the\r\nbest, mere holes in a dead wall, disconnected, perched aloft; they are\r\nnot hinged doors opening straight upon life. But they have this mark of\r\ntheir own that at each of them stands a figure with a pair of eyes,\r\nor at least with a field-glass, which forms, again and again, for\r\nobservation, a unique instrument, insuring to the person making use of\r\nit an impression distinct from every other. He and his neighbours are\r\nwatching the same show, but one seeing more where the other sees less,\r\none seeing black where the other sees white, one seeing big where the\r\nother sees small, one seeing coarse where the other sees fine. And\r\nso on, and so on; there is fortunately no saying on what, for the\r\nparticular pair of eyes, the window may _not_ open; "fortunately" by\r\nreason, precisely, of this incalculability of range. The spreading\r\nfield, the human scene, is the "choice of subject"; the pierced\r\naperture, either broad or balconied or slit-like and low-browed, is the\r\n"literary form"; but they are, singly or together, as nothing without\r\nthe posted presence of the watcher--without, in other words, the\r\nconsciousness of the artist. Tell me what the artist is, and I will tell\r\nyou of what he has _been_ conscious. Thereby I shall express to you at\r\nonce his boundless freedom and his "moral" reference.\r\n\r\nAll this is a long way round, however, for my word about my dim first\r\nmove toward "The Portrait," which was exactly my grasp of a single\r\ncharacter--an acquisition I had made, moreover, after a fashion not\r\nhere to be retraced. Enough that I was, as seemed to me, in complete\r\npossession of it, that I had been so for a long time, that this had made\r\nit familiar and yet had not blurred its charm, and that, all urgently,\r\nall tormentingly, I saw it in motion and, so to speak, in transit. This\r\namounts to saying that I saw it as bent upon its fate--some fate or\r\nother; which, among the possibilities, being precisely the question.\r\nThus I had my vivid individual--vivid, so strangely, in spite of being\r\nstill at large, not confined by the conditions, not engaged in the\r\ntangle, to which we look for much of the impress that constitutes an\r\nidentity. If the apparition was still all to be placed how came it to\r\nbe vivid?--since we puzzle such quantities out, mostly, just by the\r\nbusiness of placing them. One could answer such a question beautifully,\r\ndoubtless, if one could do so subtle, if not so monstrous, a thing as to\r\nwrite the history of the growth of one\'s imagination. One would describe\r\nthen what, at a given time, had extraordinarily happened to it, and one\r\nwould so, for instance, be in a position to tell, with an approach to\r\nclearness, how, under favour of occasion, it had been able to take over\r\n(take over straight from life) such and such a constituted, animated\r\nfigure or form. The figure has to that extent, as you see, _been_\r\nplaced--placed in the imagination that detains it, preserves,\r\nprotects, enjoys it, conscious of its presence in the dusky, crowded,\r\nheterogeneous back-shop of the mind very much as a wary dealer in\r\nprecious odds and ends, competent to make an "advance" on rare objects\r\nconfided to him, is conscious of the rare little "piece" left in deposit\r\nby the reduced, mysterious lady of title or the speculative amateur,\r\nand which is already there to disclose its merit afresh as soon as a key\r\nshall have clicked in a cupboard-door.\r\n\r\nThat may he, I recognise, a somewhat superfine analogy for the\r\nparticular "value" I here speak of, the image of the young feminine\r\nnature that I had had for so considerable a time all curiously at my\r\ndisposal; but it appears to fond memory quite to fit the fact--with the\r\nrecall, in addition, of my pious desire but to place my treasure right.\r\nI quite remind myself thus of the dealer resigned not to "realise,"\r\nresigned to keeping the precious object locked up indefinitely rather\r\nthan commit it, at no matter what price, to vulgar hands. For there\r\n_are_ dealers in these forms and figures and treasures capable of that\r\nrefinement. The point is, however, that this single small corner-stone,\r\nthe conception of a certain young woman affronting her destiny, had\r\nbegun with being all my outfit for the large building of "The Portrait\r\nof a Lady." It came to be a square and spacious house--or has at least\r\nseemed so to me in this going over it again; but, such as it is, it\r\nhad to be put up round my young woman while she stood there in perfect\r\nisolation. That is to me, artistically speaking, the circumstance of\r\ninterest; for I have lost myself once more, I confess, in the curiosity\r\nof analysing the structure. By what process of logical accretion was\r\nthis slight "personality," the mere slim shade of an intelligent but\r\npresumptuous girl, to find itself endowed with the high attributes of a\r\nSubject?--and indeed by what thinness, at the best, would such a subject\r\nnot be vitiated? Millions of presumptuous girls, intelligent or not\r\nintelligent, daily affront their destiny, and what is it open to their\r\ndestiny to be, at the most, that we should make an ado about it? The\r\nnovel is of its very nature an "ado," an ado about something, and the\r\nlarger the form it takes the greater of course the ado. Therefore,\r\nconsciously, that was what one was in for--for positively organising an\r\nado about Isabel Archer.\r\n\r\nOne looked it well in the face, I seem to remember, this extravagance;\r\nand with the effect precisely of recognising the charm of the problem.\r\nChallenge any such problem with any intelligence, and you immediately\r\nsee how full it is of substance; the wonder being, all the while, as we\r\nlook at the world, how absolutely, how inordinately, the Isabel Archers,\r\nand even much smaller female fry, insist on mattering. George Eliot has\r\nadmirably noted it--"In these frail vessels is borne onward through the\r\nages the treasure of human affection." In "Romeo and Juliet" Juliet has\r\nto be important, just as, in "Adam Bede" and "The Mill on the Floss" and\r\n"Middlemarch" and "Daniel Deronda," Hetty Sorrel and Maggie Tulliver and\r\nRosamond Vincy and Gwendolen Harleth have to be; with that much of firm\r\nground, that much of bracing air, at the disposal all the while of\r\ntheir feet and their lungs. They are typical, none the less, of a class\r\ndifficult, in the individual case, to make a centre of interest; so\r\ndifficult in fact that many an expert painter, as for instance Dickens\r\nand Walter Scott, as for instance even, in the main, so subtle a hand\r\nas that of R. L. Stevenson, has preferred to leave the task unattempted.\r\nThere are in fact writers as to whom we make out that their refuge\r\nfrom this is to assume it to be not worth their attempting; by which\r\npusillanimity in truth their honour is scantly saved. It is never an\r\nattestation of a value, or even of our imperfect sense of one, it is\r\nnever a tribute to any truth at all, that we shall represent that value\r\nbadly. It never makes up, artistically, for an artist\'s dim feeling\r\nabout a thing that he shall "do" the thing as ill as possible. There are\r\nbetter ways than that, the best of all of which is to begin with less\r\nstupidity.\r\n\r\nIt may be answered meanwhile, in regard to Shakespeare\'s and to George\r\nEliot\'s testimony, that their concession to the "importance" of their\r\nJuliets and Cleopatras and Portias (even with Portia as the very type\r\nand model of the young person intelligent and presumptuous) and to that\r\nof their Hettys and Maggies and Rosamonds and Gwendolens, suffers the\r\nabatement that these slimnesses are, when figuring as the main props of\r\nthe theme, never suffered to be sole ministers of its appeal, but have\r\ntheir inadequacy eked out with comic relief and underplots, as the\r\nplaywrights say, when not with murders and battles and the great\r\nmutations of the world. If they are shown as "mattering" as much as\r\nthey could possibly pretend to, the proof of it is in a hundred other\r\npersons, made of much stouter stuff; and each involved moreover in a\r\nhundred relations which matter to _them_ concomitantly with that one.\r\nCleopatra matters, beyond bounds, to Antony, but his colleagues,\r\nhis antagonists, the state of Rome and the impending battle also\r\nprodigiously matter; Portia matters to Antonio, and to Shylock, and\r\nto the Prince of Morocco, to the fifty aspiring princes, but for these\r\ngentry there are other lively concerns; for Antonio, notably, there\r\nare Shylock and Bassanio and his lost ventures and the extremity of\r\nhis predicament. This extremity indeed, by the same token, matters to\r\nPortia--though its doing so becomes of interest all by the fact that\r\nPortia matters to _us_. That she does so, at any rate, and that almost\r\neverything comes round to it again, supports my contention as to this\r\nfine example of the value recognised in the mere young thing. (I say\r\n"mere" young thing because I guess that even Shakespeare, preoccupied\r\nmainly though he may have been with the passions of princes, would\r\nscarce have pretended to found the best of his appeal for her on her\r\nhigh social position.) It is an example exactly of the deep difficulty\r\nbraved--the difficulty of making George Eliot\'s "frail vessel," if not\r\nthe all-in-all for our attention, at least the clearest of the call.\r\n\r\nNow to see deep difficulty braved is at any time, for the really\r\naddicted artist, to feel almost even as a pang the beautiful incentive,\r\nand to feel it verily in such sort as to wish the danger intensified.\r\nThe difficulty most worth tackling can only be for him, in these\r\nconditions, the greatest the case permits of. So I remember feeling\r\nhere (in presence, always, that is, of the particular uncertainty of my\r\nground), that there would be one way better than another--oh, ever so\r\nmuch better than any other!--of making it fight out its battle. The\r\nfrail vessel, that charged with George Eliot\'s "treasure," and thereby\r\nof such importance to those who curiously approach it, has likewise\r\npossibilities of importance to itself, possibilities which permit of\r\ntreatment and in fact peculiarly require it from the moment they are\r\nconsidered at all. There is always the escape from any close account\r\nof the weak agent of such spells by using as a bridge for evasion, for\r\nretreat and flight, the view of her relation to those surrounding her.\r\nMake it predominantly a view of _their_ relation and the trick is played:\r\nyou give the general sense of her effect, and you give it, so far as the\r\nraising on it of a superstructure goes, with the maximum of ease. Well,\r\nI recall perfectly how little, in my now quite established connexion,\r\nthe maximum of ease appealed to me, and how I seemed to get rid of it\r\nby an honest transposition of the weights in the two scales. "Place the\r\ncentre of the subject in the young woman\'s own consciousness," I said to\r\nmyself, "and you get as interesting and as beautiful a difficulty as you\r\ncould wish. Stick to _that_--for the centre; put the heaviest weight\r\ninto _that_ scale, which will be so largely the scale of her relation\r\nto herself. Make her only interested enough, at the same time, in the\r\nthings that are not herself, and this relation needn\'t fear to be too\r\nlimited. Place meanwhile in the other scale the lighter weight (which is\r\nusually the one that tips the balance of interest): press least hard, in\r\nshort, on the consciousness of your heroine\'s satellites, especially the\r\nmale; make it an interest contributive only to the greater one. See, at\r\nall events, what can be done in this way. What better field could there\r\nbe for a due ingenuity? The girl hovers, inextinguishable, as a charming\r\ncreature, and the job will be to translate her into the highest terms\r\nof that formula, and as nearly as possible moreover into _all_ of them. To\r\ndepend upon her and her little concerns wholly to see you through will\r\nnecessitate, remember, your really \'doing\' her."\r\n\r\nSo far I reasoned, and it took nothing less than that technical rigour,\r\nI now easily see, to inspire me with the right confidence for erecting\r\non such a plot of ground the neat and careful and proportioned pile of\r\nbricks that arches over it and that was thus to form, constructionally\r\nspeaking, a literary monument. Such is the aspect that to-day "The\r\nPortrait" wears for me: a structure reared with an "architectural"\r\ncompetence, as Turgenieff would have said, that makes it, to the\r\nauthor\'s own sense, the most proportioned of his productions after "The\r\nAmbassadors" which was to follow it so many years later and which has,\r\nno doubt, a superior roundness. On one thing I was determined; that,\r\nthough I should clearly have to pile brick upon brick for the creation\r\nof an interest, I would leave no pretext for saying that anything is\r\nout of line, scale or perspective. I would build large--in fine embossed\r\nvaults and painted arches, as who should say, and yet never let it\r\nappear that the chequered pavement, the ground under the reader\'s\r\nfeet, fails to stretch at every point to the base of the walls. That\r\nprecautionary spirit, on re-perusal of the book, is the old note that\r\nmost touches me: it testifies so, for my own ear, to the anxiety of my\r\nprovision for the reader\'s amusement. I felt, in view of the possible\r\nlimitations of my subject, that no such provision could be excessive,\r\nand the development of the latter was simply the general form of that\r\nearnest quest. And I find indeed that this is the only account I can\r\ngive myself of the evolution of the fable it is all under the head thus\r\nnamed that I conceive the needful accretion as having taken place, the\r\nright complications as having started. It was naturally of the essence\r\nthat the young woman should be herself complex; that was rudimentary--or\r\nwas at any rate the light in which Isabel Archer had originally dawned.\r\nIt went, however, but a certain way, and other lights, contending,\r\nconflicting lights, and of as many different colours, if possible, as\r\nthe rockets, the Roman candles and Catherine-wheels of a "pyrotechnic\r\ndisplay," would be employable to attest that she was. I had, no doubt, a\r\ngroping instinct for the right complications, since I am quite unable\r\nto track the footsteps of those that constitute, as the case stands, the\r\ngeneral situation exhibited. They are there, for what they are worth,\r\nand as numerous as might be; but my memory, I confess, is a blank as to\r\nhow and whence they came.\r\n\r\nI seem to myself to have waked up one morning in possession of them--of\r\nRalph Touchett and his parents, of Madame Merle, of Gilbert Osmond and\r\nhis daughter and his sister, of Lord Warburton, Caspar Goodwood and\r\nMiss Stackpole, the definite array of contributions to Isabel Archer\'s\r\nhistory. I recognised them, I knew them, they were the numbered pieces\r\nof my puzzle, the concrete terms of my "plot." It was as if they had\r\nsimply, by an impulse of their own, floated into my ken, and all in\r\nresponse to my primary question: "Well, what will she _do_?" Their answer\r\nseemed to be that if I would trust them they would show me; on which,\r\nwith an urgent appeal to them to make it at least as interesting as\r\nthey could, I trusted them. They were like the group of attendants and\r\nentertainers who come down by train when people in the country give a\r\nparty; they represented the contract for carrying the party on. That was\r\nan excellent relation with them--a possible one even with so broken a\r\nreed (from her slightness of cohesion) as Henrietta Stackpole. It is a\r\nfamiliar truth to the novelist, at the strenuous hour, that, as certain\r\nelements in any work are of the essence, so others are only of the\r\nform; that as this or that character, this or that disposition of the\r\nmaterial, belongs to the subject directly, so to speak, so this or that\r\nother belongs to it but indirectly--belongs intimately to the treatment.\r\nThis is a truth, however, of which he rarely gets the benefit--since it\r\ncould be assured to him, really, but by criticism based upon perception,\r\ncriticism which is too little of this world. He must not think of\r\nbenefits, moreover, I freely recognise, for that way dishonour lies:\r\nhe has, that is, but one to think of--the benefit, whatever it may be,\r\ninvolved in his having cast a spell upon the simpler, the very simplest,\r\nforms of attention. This is all he is entitled to; he is entitled to\r\nnothing, he is bound to admit, that can come to him, from the reader, as\r\na result on the latter\'s part of any act of reflexion or discrimination.\r\nHe may _enjoy_ this finer tribute--that is another affair, but on\r\ncondition only of taking it as a gratuity "thrown in," a mere miraculous\r\nwindfall, the fruit of a tree he may not pretend to have shaken. Against\r\nreflexion, against discrimination, in his interest, all earth and air\r\nconspire; wherefore it is that, as I say, he must in many a case have\r\nschooled himself, from the first, to work but for a "living wage." The\r\nliving wage is the reader\'s grant of the least possible quantity of\r\nattention required for consciousness of a "spell." The occasional\r\ncharming "tip" is an act of his intelligence over and beyond this, a\r\ngolden apple, for the writer\'s lap, straight from the wind-stirred tree.\r\nThe artist may of course, in wanton moods, dream of some Paradise (for\r\nart) where the direct appeal to the intelligence might be legalised; for\r\nto such extravagances as these his yearning mind can scarce hope ever\r\ncompletely to close itself. The most he can do is to remember they _are_\r\nextravagances.\r\n\r\nAll of which is perhaps but a gracefully devious way of saying that\r\nHenrietta Stackpole was a good example, in "The Portrait," of the truth\r\nto which I just adverted--as good an example as I could name were it not\r\nthat Maria Gostrey, in "The Ambassadors," then in the bosom of time,\r\nmay be mentioned as a better. Each of these persons is but wheels to the\r\ncoach; neither belongs to the body of that vehicle, or is for a moment\r\naccommodated with a seat inside. There the subject alone is ensconced,\r\nin the form of its "hero and heroine," and of the privileged high\r\nofficials, say, who ride with the king and queen. There are reasons\r\nwhy one would have liked this to be felt, as in general one would like\r\nalmost anything to be felt, in one\'s work, that one has one\'s self\r\ncontributively felt. We have seen, however, how idle is that pretension,\r\nwhich I should be sorry to make too much of. Maria Gostrey and Miss\r\nStackpole then are cases, each, of the light _ficelle_, not of the true\r\nagent; they may run beside the coach "for all they are worth," they may\r\ncling to it till they are out of breath (as poor Miss Stackpole all so\r\nvisibly does), but neither, all the while, so much as gets her foot on\r\nthe step, neither ceases for a moment to tread the dusty road. Put it\r\neven that they are like the fishwives who helped to bring back to Paris\r\nfrom Versailles, on that most ominous day of the first half of the\r\nFrench Revolution, the carriage of the royal family. The only thing\r\nis that I may well be asked, I acknowledge, why then, in the present\r\nfiction, I have suffered Henrietta (of whom we have indubitably too\r\nmuch) so officiously, so strangely, so almost inexplicably, to pervade.\r\nI will presently say what I can for that anomaly--and in the most\r\nconciliatory fashion.\r\n\r\nA point I wish still more to make is that if my relation of confidence\r\nwith the actors in my drama who _were_, unlike Miss Stackpole, true\r\nagents, was an excellent one to have arrived at, there still remained my\r\nrelation with the reader, which was another affair altogether and as to\r\nwhich I felt no one to be trusted but myself. That solicitude was to be\r\naccordingly expressed in the artful patience with which, as I have\r\nsaid, I piled brick upon brick. The bricks, for the whole\r\ncounting-over--putting for bricks little touches and inventions and\r\nenhancements by the way--affect me in truth as well-nigh innumerable and\r\nas ever so scrupulously fitted together and packed-in. It is an effect\r\nof detail, of the minutest; though, if one were in this connexion to say\r\nall, one would express the hope that the general, the ampler air of the\r\nmodest monument still survives. I do at least seem to catch the key to\r\na part of this abundance of small anxious, ingenious illustration as I\r\nrecollect putting my finger, in my young woman\'s interest, on the most\r\nobvious of her predicates. "What will she \'do\'? Why, the first thing\r\nshe\'ll do will be to come to Europe; which in fact will form, and all\r\ninevitably, no small part of her principal adventure. Coming to\r\nEurope is even for the \'frail vessels,\' in this wonderful age, a mild\r\nadventure; but what is truer than that on one side--the side of their\r\nindependence of flood and field, of the moving accident, of battle and\r\nmurder and sudden death--her adventures are to be mild? Without her\r\nsense of them, her sense _for_ them, as one may say, they are next to\r\nnothing at all; but isn\'t the beauty and the difficulty just in showing\r\ntheir mystic conversion by that sense, conversion into the stuff of\r\ndrama or, even more delightful word still, of \'story\'?" It was all\r\nas clear, my contention, as a silver bell. Two very good instances, I\r\nthink, of this effect of conversion, two cases of the rare chemistry,\r\nare the pages in which Isabel, coming into the drawing-room at\r\nGardencourt, coming in from a wet walk or whatever, that rainy\r\nafternoon, finds Madame Merle in possession of the place, Madame\r\nMerle seated, all absorbed but all serene, at the piano, and deeply\r\nrecognises, in the striking of such an hour, in the presence there,\r\namong the gathering shades, of this personage, of whom a moment before\r\nshe had never so much as heard, a turning-point in her life. It is\r\ndreadful to have too much, for any artistic demonstration, to dot one\'s\r\ni\'s and insist on one\'s intentions, and I am not eager to do it now; but\r\nthe question here was that of producing the maximum of intensity with\r\nthe minimum of strain.\r\n\r\nThe interest was to be raised to its pitch and yet the elements to be\r\nkept in their key; so that, should the whole thing duly impress, I might\r\nshow what an "exciting" inward life may do for the person leading it\r\neven while it remains perfectly normal. And I cannot think of a more\r\nconsistent application of that ideal unless it be in the long statement,\r\njust beyond the middle of the book, of my young woman\'s extraordinary\r\nmeditative vigil on the occasion that was to become for her such a\r\nlandmark. Reduced to its essence, it is but the vigil of searching\r\ncriticism; but it throws the action further forward that twenty\r\n"incidents" might have done. It was designed to have all the vivacity\r\nof incidents and all the economy of picture. She sits up, by her dying\r\nfire, far into the night, under the spell of recognitions on which she\r\nfinds the last sharpness suddenly wait. It is a representation simply\r\nof her motionlessly _seeing_, and an attempt withal to make the mere still\r\nlucidity of her act as "interesting" as the surprise of a caravan or the\r\nidentification of a pirate. It represents, for that matter, one of the\r\nidentifications dear to the novelist, and even indispensable to him;\r\nbut it all goes on without her being approached by another person and\r\nwithout her leaving her chair. It is obviously the best thing in the\r\nbook, but it is only a supreme illustration of the general plan. As to\r\nHenrietta, my apology for whom I just left incomplete, she exemplifies,\r\nI fear, in her superabundance, not an element of my plan, but only\r\nan excess of my zeal. So early was to begin my tendency to _overtreat_,\r\nrather than undertreat (when there was choice or danger) my subject.\r\n(Many members of my craft, I gather, are far from agreeing with me, but\r\nI have always held overtreating the minor disservice.) "Treating" that\r\nof "The Portrait" amounted to never forgetting, by any lapse, that the\r\nthing was under a special obligation to be amusing. There was the danger\r\nof the noted "thinness"--which was to be averted, tooth and nail,\r\nby cultivation of the lively. That is at least how I see it to-day.\r\nHenrietta must have been at that time a part of my wonderful notion of\r\nthe lively. And then there was another matter. I had, within the few\r\npreceding years, come to live in London, and the "international" light\r\nlay, in those days, to my sense, thick and rich upon the scene. It was\r\nthe light in which so much of the picture hung. But that _is_ another\r\nmatter. There is really too much to say.\r\n\r\nHENRY JAMES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PORTRAIT OF A LADY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nUnder certain circumstances there are few hours in life more agreeable\r\nthan the hour dedicated to the ceremony known as afternoon tea. There\r\nare circumstances in which, whether you partake of the tea or not--some\r\npeople of course never do,--the situation is in itself delightful. Those\r\nthat I have in mind in beginning to unfold this simple history offered\r\nan admirable setting to an innocent pastime. The implements of\r\nthe little feast had been disposed upon the lawn of an old English\r\ncountry-house, in what I should call the perfect middle of a splendid\r\nsummer afternoon. Part of the afternoon had waned, but much of it was\r\nleft, and what was left was of the finest and rarest quality. Real dusk\r\nwould not arrive for many hours; but the flood of summer light had begun\r\nto ebb, the air had grown mellow, the shadows were long upon the smooth,\r\ndense turf. They lengthened slowly, however, and the scene expressed\r\nthat sense of leisure still to come which is perhaps the chief source\r\nof one\'s enjoyment of such a scene at such an hour. From five o\'clock to\r\neight is on certain occasions a little eternity; but on such an occasion\r\nas this the interval could be only an eternity of pleasure. The persons\r\nconcerned in it were taking their pleasure quietly, and they were not\r\nof the sex which is supposed to furnish the regular votaries of the\r\nceremony I have mentioned. The shadows on the perfect lawn were straight\r\nand angular; they were the shadows of an old man sitting in a deep\r\nwicker-chair near the low table on which the tea had been served, and\r\nof two younger men strolling to and fro, in desultory talk, in front of\r\nhim. The old man had his cup in his hand; it was an unusually large cup,\r\nof a different pattern from the rest of the set and painted in brilliant\r\ncolours. He disposed of its contents with much circumspection, holding\r\nit for a long time close to his chin, with his face turned to the house.\r\nHis companions had either finished their tea or were indifferent to\r\ntheir privilege; they smoked cigarettes as they continued to stroll.\r\nOne of them, from time to time, as he passed, looked with a certain\r\nattention at the elder man, who, unconscious of observation, rested his\r\neyes upon the rich red front of his dwelling. The house that rose beyond\r\nthe lawn was a structure to repay such consideration and was the most\r\ncharacteristic object in the peculiarly English picture I have attempted\r\nto sketch.\r\n\r\nIt stood upon a low hill, above the river--the river being the Thames at\r\nsome forty miles from London. A long gabled front of red brick, with\r\nthe complexion of which time and the weather had played all sorts of\r\npictorial tricks, only, however, to improve and refine it, presented\r\nto the lawn its patches of ivy, its clustered chimneys, its windows\r\nsmothered in creepers. The house had a name and a history; the old\r\ngentleman taking his tea would have been delighted to tell you these\r\nthings: how it had been built under Edward the Sixth, had offered a\r\nnight\'s hospitality to the great Elizabeth (whose august person had\r\nextended itself upon a huge, magnificent and terribly angular bed which\r\nstill formed the principal honour of the sleeping apartments), had been\r\na good deal bruised and defaced in Cromwell\'s wars, and then, under the\r\nRestoration, repaired and much enlarged; and how, finally, after having\r\nbeen remodelled and disfigured in the eighteenth century, it had passed\r\ninto the careful keeping of a shrewd American banker, who had bought it\r\noriginally because (owing to circumstances too complicated to set forth)\r\nit was offered at a great bargain: bought it with much grumbling at its\r\nugliness, its antiquity, its incommodity, and who now, at the end of\r\ntwenty years, had become conscious of a real aesthetic passion for it,\r\nso that he knew all its points and would tell you just where to stand\r\nto see them in combination and just the hour when the shadows of\r\nits various protuberances which fell so softly upon the warm, weary\r\nbrickwork--were of the right measure. Besides this, as I have said,\r\nhe could have counted off most of the successive owners and occupants,\r\nseveral of whom were known to general fame; doing so, however, with an\r\nundemonstrative conviction that the latest phase of its destiny was not\r\nthe least honourable. The front of the house overlooking that portion\r\nof the lawn with which we are concerned was not the entrance-front; this\r\nwas in quite another quarter. Privacy here reigned supreme, and the wide\r\ncarpet of turf that covered the level hill-top seemed but the extension\r\nof a luxurious interior. The great still oaks and beeches flung down a\r\nshade as dense as that of velvet curtains; and the place was furnished,\r\nlike a room, with cushioned seats, with rich-coloured rugs, with\r\nthe books and papers that lay upon the grass. The river was at some\r\ndistance; where the ground began to slope the lawn, properly speaking,\r\nceased. But it was none the less a charming walk down to the water.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman at the tea-table, who had come from America thirty\r\nyears before, had brought with him, at the top of his baggage, his\r\nAmerican physiognomy; and he had not only brought it with him, but he\r\nhad kept it in the best order, so that, if necessary, he might have\r\ntaken it back to his own country with perfect confidence. At present,\r\nobviously, nevertheless, he was not likely to displace himself; his\r\njourneys were over and he was taking the rest that precedes the\r\ngreat rest. He had a narrow, clean-shaven face, with features evenly\r\ndistributed and an expression of placid acuteness. It was evidently a\r\nface in which the range of representation was not large, so that the air\r\nof contented shrewdness was all the more of a merit. It seemed to tell\r\nthat he had been successful in life, yet it seemed to tell also that his\r\nsuccess had not been exclusive and invidious, but had had much of the\r\ninoffensiveness of failure. He had certainly had a great experience of\r\nmen, but there was an almost rustic simplicity in the faint smile that\r\nplayed upon his lean, spacious cheek and lighted up his humorous eye\r\nas he at last slowly and carefully deposited his big tea-cup upon the\r\ntable. He was neatly dressed, in well-brushed black; but a shawl was\r\nfolded upon his knees, and his feet were encased in thick, embroidered\r\nslippers. A beautiful collie dog lay upon the grass near his chair,\r\nwatching the master\'s face almost as tenderly as the master took in the\r\nstill more magisterial physiognomy of the house; and a little bristling,\r\nbustling terrier bestowed a desultory attendance upon the other\r\ngentlemen.\r\n\r\nOne of these was a remarkably well-made man of five-and-thirty, with a\r\nface as English as that of the old gentleman I have just sketched was\r\nsomething else; a noticeably handsome face, fresh-coloured, fair and\r\nfrank, with firm, straight features, a lively grey eye and the rich\r\nadornment of a chestnut beard. This person had a certain fortunate,\r\nbrilliant exceptional look--the air of a happy temperament fertilised by\r\na high civilisation--which would have made almost any observer envy him\r\nat a venture. He was booted and spurred, as if he had dismounted from a\r\nlong ride; he wore a white hat, which looked too large for him; he\r\nheld his two hands behind him, and in one of them--a large, white,\r\nwell-shaped fist--was crumpled a pair of soiled dog-skin gloves.\r\n\r\nHis companion, measuring the length of the lawn beside him, was a person\r\nof quite a different pattern, who, although he might have excited\r\ngrave curiosity, would not, like the other, have provoked you to wish\r\nyourself, almost blindly, in his place. Tall, lean, loosely and feebly\r\nput together, he had an ugly, sickly, witty, charming face, furnished,\r\nbut by no means decorated, with a straggling moustache and whisker. He\r\nlooked clever and ill--a combination by no means felicitous; and he wore\r\na brown velvet jacket. He carried his hands in his pockets, and there\r\nwas something in the way he did it that showed the habit was inveterate.\r\nHis gait had a shambling, wandering quality; he was not very firm on\r\nhis legs. As I have said, whenever he passed the old man in the chair he\r\nrested his eyes upon him; and at this moment, with their faces brought\r\ninto relation, you would easily have seen they were father and son.\r\nThe father caught his son\'s eye at last and gave him a mild, responsive\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"I\'m getting on very well," he said.\r\n\r\n"Have you drunk your tea?" asked the son.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and enjoyed it."\r\n\r\n"Shall I give you some more?"\r\n\r\nThe old man considered, placidly. "Well, I guess I\'ll wait and see." He\r\nhad, in speaking, the American tone.\r\n\r\n"Are you cold?" the son enquired.\r\n\r\nThe father slowly rubbed his legs. "Well, I don\'t know. I can\'t tell\r\ntill I feel."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps some one might feel for you," said the younger man, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I hope some one will always feel for me! Don\'t you feel for me,\r\nLord Warburton?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, immensely," said the gentleman addressed as Lord Warburton,\r\npromptly. "I\'m bound to say you look wonderfully comfortable."\r\n\r\n"Well, I suppose I am, in most respects." And the old man looked down at\r\nhis green shawl and smoothed it over his knees. "The fact is I\'ve been\r\ncomfortable so many years that I suppose I\'ve got so used to it I don\'t\r\nknow it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s the bore of comfort," said Lord Warburton. "We only know\r\nwhen we\'re uncomfortable."\r\n\r\n"It strikes me we\'re rather particular," his companion remarked.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, there\'s no doubt we\'re particular," Lord Warburton murmured.\r\nAnd then the three men remained silent a while; the two younger ones\r\nstanding looking down at the other, who presently asked for more tea. "I\r\nshould think you would be very unhappy with that shawl," Lord Warburton\r\nresumed while his companion filled the old man\'s cup again.\r\n\r\n"Oh no, he must have the shawl!" cried the gentleman in the velvet coat.\r\n"Don\'t put such ideas as that into his head."\r\n\r\n"It belongs to my wife," said the old man simply.\r\n\r\n"Oh, if it\'s for sentimental reasons--" And Lord Warburton made a\r\ngesture of apology.\r\n\r\n"I suppose I must give it to her when she comes," the old man went on.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll please to do nothing of the kind. You\'ll keep it to cover your\r\npoor old legs."\r\n\r\n"Well, you mustn\'t abuse my legs," said the old man. "I guess they are\r\nas good as yours."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'re perfectly free to abuse mine," his son replied, giving him\r\nhis tea.\r\n\r\n"Well, we\'re two lame ducks; I don\'t think there\'s much difference."\r\n\r\n"I\'m much obliged to you for calling me a duck. How\'s your tea?"\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s rather hot."\r\n\r\n"That\'s intended to be a merit."\r\n\r\n"Ah, there\'s a great deal of merit," murmured the old man, kindly. "He\'s\r\na very good nurse, Lord Warburton."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t he a bit clumsy?" asked his lordship.\r\n\r\n"Oh no, he\'s not clumsy--considering that he\'s an invalid himself. He\'s\r\na very good nurse--for a sick-nurse. I call him my sick-nurse because\r\nhe\'s sick himself."\r\n\r\n"Oh, come, daddy!" the ugly young man exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Well, you are; I wish you weren\'t. But I suppose you can\'t help it."\r\n\r\n"I might try: that\'s an idea," said the young man.\r\n\r\n"Were you ever sick, Lord Warburton?" his father asked.\r\n\r\nLord Warburton considered a moment. "Yes, sir, once, in the Persian\r\nGulf."\r\n\r\n"He\'s making light of you, daddy," said the other young man. "That\'s a\r\nsort of joke."\r\n\r\n"Well, there seem to be so many sorts now," daddy replied, serenely.\r\n"You don\'t look as if you had been sick, anyway, Lord Warburton."\r\n\r\n"He\'s sick of life; he was just telling me so; going on fearfully about\r\nit," said Lord Warburton\'s friend.\r\n\r\n"Is that true, sir?" asked the old man gravely.\r\n\r\n"If it is, your son gave me no consolation. He\'s a wretched fellow to\r\ntalk to--a regular cynic. He doesn\'t seem to believe in anything."\r\n\r\n"That\'s another sort of joke," said the person accused of cynicism.\r\n\r\n"It\'s because his health is so poor," his father explained to Lord\r\nWarburton. "It affects his mind and colours his way of looking at\r\nthings; he seems to feel as if he had never had a chance. But it\'s\r\nalmost entirely theoretical, you know; it doesn\'t seem to affect his\r\nspirits. I\'ve hardly ever seen him when he wasn\'t cheerful--about as he\r\nis at present. He often cheers me up."\r\n\r\nThe young man so described looked at Lord Warburton and laughed. "Is it\r\na glowing eulogy or an accusation of levity? Should you like me to carry\r\nout my theories, daddy?"\r\n\r\n"By Jove, we should see some queer things!" cried Lord Warburton.\r\n\r\n"I hope you haven\'t taken up that sort of tone," said the old man.\r\n\r\n"Warburton\'s tone is worse than mine; he pretends to be bored. I\'m not\r\nin the least bored; I find life only too interesting."\r\n\r\n"Ah, too interesting; you shouldn\'t allow it to be that, you know!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m never bored when I come here," said Lord Warburton. "One gets such\r\nuncommonly good talk."\r\n\r\n"Is that another sort of joke?" asked the old man. "You\'ve no excuse for\r\nbeing bored anywhere. When I was your age I had never heard of such a\r\nthing."\r\n\r\n"You must have developed very late."\r\n\r\n"No, I developed very quick; that was just the reason. When I was twenty\r\nyears old I was very highly developed indeed. I was working tooth and\r\nnail. You wouldn\'t be bored if you had something to do; but all you\r\nyoung men are too idle. You think too much of your pleasure. You\'re too\r\nfastidious, and too indolent, and too rich."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I say," cried Lord Warburton, "you\'re hardly the person to accuse a\r\nfellow-creature of being too rich!"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean because I\'m a banker?" asked the old man.\r\n\r\n"Because of that, if you like; and because you have--haven\'t you?--such\r\nunlimited means."\r\n\r\n"He isn\'t very rich," the other young man mercifully pleaded. "He has\r\ngiven away an immense deal of money."\r\n\r\n"Well, I suppose it was his own," said Lord Warburton; "and in that case\r\ncould there be a better proof of wealth? Let not a public benefactor\r\ntalk of one\'s being too fond of pleasure."\r\n\r\n"Daddy\'s very fond of pleasure--of other people\'s."\r\n\r\nThe old man shook his head. "I don\'t pretend to have contributed\r\nanything to the amusement of my contemporaries."\r\n\r\n"My dear father, you\'re too modest!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s a kind of joke, sir," said Lord Warburton.\r\n\r\n"You young men have too many jokes. When there are no jokes you\'ve\r\nnothing left."\r\n\r\n"Fortunately there are always more jokes," the ugly young man remarked.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe it--I believe things are getting more serious. You\r\nyoung men will find that out."\r\n\r\n"The increasing seriousness of things, then that\'s the great opportunity\r\nof jokes."\r\n\r\n"They\'ll have to be grim jokes," said the old man. "I\'m convinced there\r\nwill be great changes, and not all for the better."\r\n\r\n"I quite agree with you, sir," Lord Warburton declared. "I\'m very sure\r\nthere will be great changes, and that all sorts of queer things will\r\nhappen. That\'s why I find so much difficulty in applying your advice;\r\nyou know you told me the other day that I ought to \'take hold\' of\r\nsomething. One hesitates to take hold of a thing that may the next\r\nmoment be knocked sky-high."\r\n\r\n"You ought to take hold of a pretty woman," said his companion. "He\'s\r\ntrying hard to fall in love," he added, by way of explanation, to his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n"The pretty women themselves may be sent flying!" Lord Warburton\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\n"No, no, they\'ll be firm," the old man rejoined; "they\'ll not be\r\naffected by the social and political changes I just referred to."\r\n\r\n"You mean they won\'t be abolished? Very well, then, I\'ll lay hands on\r\none as soon as possible and tie her round my neck as a life-preserver."\r\n\r\n"The ladies will save us," said the old man; "that is the best of them\r\nwill--for I make a difference between them. Make up to a good one and\r\nmarry her, and your life will become much more interesting."\r\n\r\nA momentary silence marked perhaps on the part of his auditors a sense\r\nof the magnanimity of this speech, for it was a secret neither for his\r\nson nor for his visitor that his own experiment in matrimony had not\r\nbeen a happy one. As he said, however, he made a difference; and these\r\nwords may have been intended as a confession of personal error; though\r\nof course it was not in place for either of his companions to remark\r\nthat apparently the lady of his choice had not been one of the best.\r\n\r\n"If I marry an interesting woman I shall be interested: is that what you\r\nsay?" Lord Warburton asked. "I\'m not at all keen about marrying--your\r\nson misrepresented me; but there\'s no knowing what an interesting woman\r\nmight do with me."\r\n\r\n"I should like to see your idea of an interesting woman," said his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow, you can\'t see ideas--especially such highly ethereal\r\nones as mine. If I could only see it myself--that would be a great step\r\nin advance."\r\n\r\n"Well, you may fall in love with whomsoever you please; but you mustn\'t\r\nfall in love with my niece," said the old man.\r\n\r\nHis son broke into a laugh. "He\'ll think you mean that as a provocation!\r\nMy dear father, you\'ve lived with the English for thirty years, and\r\nyou\'ve picked up a good many of the things they say. But you\'ve never\r\nlearned the things they don\'t say!"\r\n\r\n"I say what I please," the old man returned with all his serenity.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t the honour of knowing your niece," Lord Warburton said. "I\r\nthink it\'s the first time I\'ve heard of her."\r\n\r\n"She\'s a niece of my wife\'s; Mrs. Touchett brings her to England."\r\n\r\nThen young Mr. Touchett explained. "My mother, you know, has been\r\nspending the winter in America, and we\'re expecting her back. She writes\r\nthat she has discovered a niece and that she has invited her to come out\r\nwith her."\r\n\r\n"I see,--very kind of her," said Lord Warburton. Is the young lady\r\ninteresting?"\r\n\r\n"We hardly know more about her than you; my mother has not gone into\r\ndetails. She chiefly communicates with us by means of telegrams, and her\r\ntelegrams are rather inscrutable. They say women don\'t know how to write\r\nthem, but my mother has thoroughly mastered the art of condensation.\r\n\'Tired America, hot weather awful, return England with niece, first\r\nsteamer decent cabin.\' That\'s the sort of message we get from her--that\r\nwas the last that came. But there had been another before, which I think\r\ncontained the first mention of the niece. \'Changed hotel, very bad,\r\nimpudent clerk, address here. Taken sister\'s girl, died last year, go to\r\nEurope, two sisters, quite independent.\' Over that my father and I\r\nhave scarcely stopped puzzling; it seems to admit of so many\r\ninterpretations."\r\n\r\n"There\'s one thing very clear in it," said the old man; "she has given\r\nthe hotel-clerk a dressing."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not sure even of that, since he has driven her from the field. We\r\nthought at first that the sister mentioned might be the sister of the\r\nclerk; but the subsequent mention of a niece seems to prove that the\r\nallusion is to one of my aunts. Then there was a question as to whose\r\nthe two other sisters were; they are probably two of my late aunt\'s\r\ndaughters. But who\'s \'quite independent,\' and in what sense is the term\r\nused?--that point\'s not yet settled. Does the expression apply more\r\nparticularly to the young lady my mother has adopted, or does it\r\ncharacterise her sisters equally?--and is it used in a moral or in a\r\nfinancial sense? Does it mean that they\'ve been left well off, or\r\nthat they wish to be under no obligations? or does it simply mean that\r\nthey\'re fond of their own way?"\r\n\r\n"Whatever else it means, it\'s pretty sure to mean that," Mr. Touchett\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll see for yourself," said Lord Warburton. "When does Mrs. Touchett\r\narrive?"\r\n\r\n"We\'re quite in the dark; as soon as she can find a decent cabin.\r\nShe may be waiting for it yet; on the other hand she may already have\r\ndisembarked in England."\r\n\r\n"In that case she would probably have telegraphed to you."\r\n\r\n"She never telegraphs when you would expect it--only when you don\'t,"\r\nsaid the old man. "She likes to drop on me suddenly; she thinks she\'ll\r\nfind me doing something wrong. She has never done so yet, but she\'s not\r\ndiscouraged."\r\n\r\n"It\'s her share in the family trait, the independence she speaks of."\r\nHer son\'s appreciation of the matter was more favourable. "Whatever the\r\nhigh spirit of those young ladies may be, her own is a match for it. She\r\nlikes to do everything for herself and has no belief in any one\'s power\r\nto help her. She thinks me of no more use than a postage-stamp without\r\ngum, and she would never forgive me if I should presume to go to\r\nLiverpool to meet her."\r\n\r\n"Will you at least let me know when your cousin arrives?" Lord Warburton\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"Only on the condition I\'ve mentioned--that you don\'t fall in love with\r\nher!" Mr. Touchett replied.\r\n\r\n"That strikes me as hard, don\'t you think me good enough?"\r\n\r\n"I think you too good--because I shouldn\'t like her to marry you. She\r\nhasn\'t come here to look for a husband, I hope; so many young ladies are\r\ndoing that, as if there were no good ones at home. Then she\'s probably\r\nengaged; American girls are usually engaged, I believe. Moreover I\'m not\r\nsure, after all, that you\'d be a remarkable husband."\r\n\r\n"Very likely she\'s engaged; I\'ve known a good many American girls, and\r\nthey always were; but I could never see that it made any difference,\r\nupon my word! As for my being a good husband," Mr. Touchett\'s visitor\r\npursued, "I\'m not sure of that either. One can but try!"\r\n\r\n"Try as much as you please, but don\'t try on my niece," smiled the old\r\nman, whose opposition to the idea was broadly humorous.\r\n\r\n"Ah, well," said Lord Warburton with a humour broader still, "perhaps,\r\nafter all, she\'s not worth trying on!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nWhile this exchange of pleasantries took place between the two Ralph\r\nTouchett wandered away a little, with his usual slouching gait, his\r\nhands in his pockets and his little rowdyish terrier at his heels. His\r\nface was turned toward the house, but his eyes were bent musingly on the\r\nlawn; so that he had been an object of observation to a person who had\r\njust made her appearance in the ample doorway for some moments before\r\nhe perceived her. His attention was called to her by the conduct of\r\nhis dog, who had suddenly darted forward with a little volley of shrill\r\nbarks, in which the note of welcome, however, was more sensible than\r\nthat of defiance. The person in question was a young lady, who seemed\r\nimmediately to interpret the greeting of the small beast. He advanced\r\nwith great rapidity and stood at her feet, looking up and barking hard;\r\nwhereupon, without hesitation, she stooped and caught him in her hands,\r\nholding him face to face while he continued his quick chatter. His\r\nmaster now had had time to follow and to see that Bunchie\'s new friend\r\nwas a tall girl in a black dress, who at first sight looked pretty.\r\nShe was bareheaded, as if she were staying in the house--a fact which\r\nconveyed perplexity to the son of its master, conscious of that immunity\r\nfrom visitors which had for some time been rendered necessary by the\r\nlatter\'s ill-health. Meantime the two other gentlemen had also taken\r\nnote of the new-comer.\r\n\r\n"Dear me, who\'s that strange woman?" Mr. Touchett had asked.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it\'s Mrs. Touchett\'s niece--the independent young lady," Lord\r\nWarburton suggested. "I think she must be, from the way she handles the\r\ndog."\r\n\r\nThe collie, too, had now allowed his attention to be diverted, and he\r\ntrotted toward the young lady in the doorway, slowly setting his tail in\r\nmotion as he went.\r\n\r\n"But where\'s my wife then?" murmured the old man.\r\n\r\n"I suppose the young lady has left her somewhere: that\'s a part of the\r\nindependence."\r\n\r\nThe girl spoke to Ralph, smiling, while she still held up the terrier.\r\n"Is this your little dog, sir?"\r\n\r\n"He was mine a moment ago; but you\'ve suddenly acquired a remarkable air\r\nof property in him."\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t we share him?" asked the girl. "He\'s such a perfect little\r\ndarling."\r\n\r\nRalph looked at her a moment; she was unexpectedly pretty. "You may have\r\nhim altogether," he then replied.\r\n\r\nThe young lady seemed to have a great deal of confidence, both in\r\nherself and in others; but this abrupt generosity made her blush. "I\r\nought to tell you that I\'m probably your cousin," she brought out,\r\nputting down the dog. "And here\'s another!" she added quickly, as the\r\ncollie came up.\r\n\r\n"Probably?" the young man exclaimed, laughing. "I supposed it was quite\r\nsettled! Have you arrived with my mother?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, half an hour ago."\r\n\r\n"And has she deposited you and departed again?"\r\n\r\n"No, she went straight to her room, and she told me that, if I should\r\nsee you, I was to say to you that you must come to her there at a\r\nquarter to seven."\r\n\r\nThe young man looked at his watch. "Thank you very much; I shall be\r\npunctual." And then he looked at his cousin. "You\'re very welcome here.\r\nI\'m delighted to see you."\r\n\r\nShe was looking at everything, with an eye that denoted clear\r\nperception--at her companion, at the two dogs, at the two gentlemen\r\nunder the trees, at the beautiful scene that surrounded her. "I\'ve never\r\nseen anything so lovely as this place. I\'ve been all over the house;\r\nit\'s too enchanting."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry you should have been here so long without our knowing it."\r\n\r\n"Your mother told me that in England people arrived very quietly; so I\r\nthought it was all right. Is one of those gentlemen your father?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, the elder one--the one sitting down," said Ralph.\r\n\r\nThe girl gave a laugh. "I don\'t suppose it\'s the other. Who\'s the\r\nother?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s a friend of ours--Lord Warburton."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I hoped there would be a lord; it\'s just like a novel!" And then,\r\n"Oh you adorable creature!" she suddenly cried, stooping down and\r\npicking up the small dog again.\r\n\r\nShe remained standing where they had met, making no offer to advance or\r\nto speak to Mr. Touchett, and while she lingered so near the threshold,\r\nslim and charming, her interlocutor wondered if she expected the old man\r\nto come and pay her his respects. American girls were used to a great\r\ndeal of deference, and it had been intimated that this one had a high\r\nspirit. Indeed Ralph could see that in her face.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you come and make acquaintance with my father?" he nevertheless\r\nventured to ask. "He\'s old and infirm--he doesn\'t leave his chair."\r\n\r\n"Ah, poor man, I\'m very sorry!" the girl exclaimed, immediately moving\r\nforward. "I got the impression from your mother that he was rather\r\nintensely active."\r\n\r\nRalph Touchett was silent a moment. "She hasn\'t seen him for a year."\r\n\r\n"Well, he has a lovely place to sit. Come along, little hound."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a dear old place," said the young man, looking sidewise at his\r\nneighbour.\r\n\r\n"What\'s his name?" she asked, her attention having again reverted to the\r\nterrier.\r\n\r\n"My father\'s name?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the young lady with amusement; "but don\'t tell him I asked\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nThey had come by this time to where old Mr. Touchett was sitting, and he\r\nslowly got up from his chair to introduce himself.\r\n\r\n"My mother has arrived," said Ralph, "and this is Miss Archer."\r\n\r\nThe old man placed his two hands on her shoulders, looked at her a\r\nmoment with extreme benevolence and then gallantly kissed her. "It\'s\r\na great pleasure to me to see you here; but I wish you had given us a\r\nchance to receive you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, we were received," said the girl. "There were about a dozen\r\nservants in the hall. And there was an old woman curtseying at the\r\ngate."\r\n\r\n"We can do better than that--if we have notice!" And the old man stood\r\nthere smiling, rubbing his hands and slowly shaking his head at her.\r\n"But Mrs. Touchett doesn\'t like receptions."\r\n\r\n"She went straight to her room."\r\n\r\n"Yes--and locked herself in. She always does that. Well, I suppose I\r\nshall see her next week." And Mrs. Touchett\'s husband slowly resumed his\r\nformer posture.\r\n\r\n"Before that," said Miss Archer. "She\'s coming down to dinner--at eight\r\no\'clock. Don\'t you forget a quarter to seven," she added, turning with a\r\nsmile to Ralph.\r\n\r\n"What\'s to happen at a quarter to seven?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m to see my mother," said Ralph.\r\n\r\n"Ah, happy boy!" the old man commented. "You must sit down--you must\r\nhave some tea," he observed to his wife\'s niece.\r\n\r\n"They gave me some tea in my room the moment I got there," this young\r\nlady answered. "I\'m sorry you\'re out of health," she added, resting her\r\neyes upon her venerable host.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m an old man, my dear; it\'s time for me to be old. But I shall be\r\nthe better for having you here."\r\n\r\nShe had been looking all round her again--at the lawn, the great trees,\r\nthe reedy, silvery Thames, the beautiful old house; and while engaged\r\nin this survey she had made room in it for her companions; a\r\ncomprehensiveness of observation easily conceivable on the part of a\r\nyoung woman who was evidently both intelligent and excited. She had\r\nseated herself and had put away the little dog; her white hands, in\r\nher lap, were folded upon her black dress; her head was erect, her eye\r\nlighted, her flexible figure turned itself easily this way and that, in\r\nsympathy with the alertness with which she evidently caught impressions.\r\nHer impressions were numerous, and they were all reflected in a clear,\r\nstill smile. "I\'ve never seen anything so beautiful as this."\r\n\r\n"It\'s looking very well," said Mr. Touchett. "I know the way it strikes\r\nyou. I\'ve been through all that. But you\'re very beautiful yourself," he\r\nadded with a politeness by no means crudely jocular and with the happy\r\nconsciousness that his advanced age gave him the privilege of saying\r\nsuch things--even to young persons who might possibly take alarm at\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhat degree of alarm this young person took need not be exactly\r\nmeasured; she instantly rose, however, with a blush which was not a\r\nrefutation. "Oh yes, of course I\'m lovely!" she returned with a quick\r\nlaugh. "How old is your house? Is it Elizabethan?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s early Tudor," said Ralph Touchett.\r\n\r\nShe turned toward him, watching his face. "Early Tudor? How very\r\ndelightful! And I suppose there are a great many others."\r\n\r\n"There are many much better ones."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say that, my son!" the old man protested. "There\'s nothing better\r\nthan this."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got a very good one; I think in some respects it\'s rather better,"\r\nsaid Lord Warburton, who as yet had not spoken, but who had kept an\r\nattentive eye upon Miss Archer. He slightly inclined himself, smiling;\r\nhe had an excellent manner with women. The girl appreciated it in an\r\ninstant; she had not forgotten that this was Lord Warburton. "I should\r\nlike very much to show it to you," he added.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t believe him," cried the old man; "don\'t look at it! It\'s a\r\nwretched old barrack--not to be compared with this."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know--I can\'t judge," said the girl, smiling at Lord Warburton.\r\n\r\nIn this discussion Ralph Touchett took no interest whatever; he stood\r\nwith his hands in his pockets, looking greatly as if he should like to\r\nrenew his conversation with his new-found cousin.\r\n\r\n"Are you very fond of dogs?" he enquired by way of beginning. He seemed\r\nto recognise that it was an awkward beginning for a clever man.\r\n\r\n"Very fond of them indeed."\r\n\r\n"You must keep the terrier, you know," he went on, still awkwardly.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll keep him while I\'m here, with pleasure."\r\n\r\n"That will be for a long time, I hope."\r\n\r\n"You\'re very kind. I hardly know. My aunt must settle that."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll settle it with her--at a quarter to seven." And Ralph looked at\r\nhis watch again.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad to be here at all," said the girl.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe you allow things to be settled for you."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; if they\'re settled as I like them."\r\n\r\n"I shall settle this as I like it," said Ralph. "It\'s most unaccountable\r\nthat we should never have known you."\r\n\r\n"I was there--you had only to come and see me."\r\n\r\n"There? Where do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"In the United States: in New York and Albany and other American\r\nplaces."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been there--all over, but I never saw you. I can\'t make it out."\r\n\r\nMiss Archer just hesitated. "It was because there had been some\r\ndisagreement between your mother and my father, after my mother\'s death,\r\nwhich took place when I was a child. In consequence of it we never\r\nexpected to see you."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but I don\'t embrace all my mother\'s quarrels--heaven forbid!"\r\nthe young man cried. "You\'ve lately lost your father?" he went on more\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n"Yes; more than a year ago. After that my aunt was very kind to me; she\r\ncame to see me and proposed that I should come with her to Europe."\r\n\r\n"I see," said Ralph. "She has adopted you."\r\n\r\n"Adopted me?" The girl stared, and her blush came back to her, together\r\nwith a momentary look of pain which gave her interlocutor some alarm. He\r\nhad underestimated the effect of his words. Lord Warburton, who appeared\r\nconstantly desirous of a nearer view of Miss Archer, strolled toward the\r\ntwo cousins at the moment, and as he did so she rested her wider eyes on\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Oh no; she has not adopted me. I\'m not a candidate for adoption."\r\n\r\n"I beg a thousand pardons," Ralph murmured. "I meant--I meant--" He\r\nhardly knew what he meant.\r\n\r\n"You meant she has taken me up. Yes; she likes to take people up.\r\nShe has been very kind to me; but," she added with a certain visible\r\neagerness of desire to be explicit, "I\'m very fond of my liberty."\r\n\r\n"Are you talking about Mrs. Touchett?" the old man called out from his\r\nchair. "Come here, my dear, and tell me about her. I\'m always thankful\r\nfor information."\r\n\r\nThe girl hesitated again, smiling. "She\'s really very benevolent,"\r\nshe answered; after which she went over to her uncle, whose mirth was\r\nexcited by her words.\r\n\r\nLord Warburton was left standing with Ralph Touchett, to whom in a\r\nmoment he said: "You wished a while ago to see my idea of an interesting\r\nwoman. There it is!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMrs. Touchett was certainly a person of many oddities, of which her\r\nbehaviour on returning to her husband\'s house after many months was a\r\nnoticeable specimen. She had her own way of doing all that she did, and\r\nthis is the simplest description of a character which, although by no\r\nmeans without liberal motions, rarely succeeded in giving an impression\r\nof suavity. Mrs. Touchett might do a great deal of good, but she\r\nnever pleased. This way of her own, of which she was so fond, was not\r\nintrinsically offensive--it was just unmistakeably distinguished from\r\nthe ways of others. The edges of her conduct were so very clear-cut that\r\nfor susceptible persons it sometimes had a knife-like effect. That hard\r\nfineness came out in her deportment during the first hours of her return\r\nfrom America, under circumstances in which it might have seemed that\r\nher first act would have been to exchange greetings with her husband\r\nand son. Mrs. Touchett, for reasons which she deemed excellent, always\r\nretired on such occasions into impenetrable seclusion, postponing the\r\nmore sentimental ceremony until she had repaired the disorder of dress\r\nwith a completeness which had the less reason to be of high importance\r\nas neither beauty nor vanity were concerned in it. She was a plain-faced\r\nold woman, without graces and without any great elegance, but with an\r\nextreme respect for her own motives. She was usually prepared to explain\r\nthese--when the explanation was asked as a favour; and in such a case\r\nthey proved totally different from those that had been attributed to\r\nher. She was virtually separated from her husband, but she appeared to\r\nperceive nothing irregular in the situation. It had become clear, at an\r\nearly stage of their community, that they should never desire the same\r\nthing at the same moment, and this appearance had prompted her to rescue\r\ndisagreement from the vulgar realm of accident. She did what she could\r\nto erect it into a law--a much more edifying aspect of it--by going to\r\nlive in Florence, where she bought a house and established herself; and\r\nby leaving her husband to take care of the English branch of his bank.\r\nThis arrangement greatly pleased her; it was so felicitously definite.\r\nIt struck her husband in the same light, in a foggy square in London,\r\nwhere it was at times the most definite fact he discerned; but he\r\nwould have preferred that such unnatural things should have a greater\r\nvagueness. To agree to disagree had cost him an effort; he was ready to\r\nagree to almost anything but that, and saw no reason why either assent\r\nor dissent should be so terribly consistent. Mrs. Touchett indulged in\r\nno regrets nor speculations, and usually came once a year to spend a\r\nmonth with her husband, a period during which she apparently took pains\r\nto convince him that she had adopted the right system. She was not fond\r\nof the English style of life, and had three or four reasons for it to\r\nwhich she currently alluded; they bore upon minor points of that ancient\r\norder, but for Mrs. Touchett they amply justified non-residence. She\r\ndetested bread-sauce, which, as she said, looked like a poultice\r\nand tasted like soap; she objected to the consumption of beer by\r\nher maid-servants; and she affirmed that the British laundress (Mrs.\r\nTouchett was very particular about the appearance of her linen) was not\r\na mistress of her art. At fixed intervals she paid a visit to her own\r\ncountry; but this last had been longer than any of its predecessors.\r\n\r\nShe had taken up her niece--there was little doubt of that. One wet\r\nafternoon, some four months earlier than the occurrence lately narrated,\r\nthis young lady had been seated alone with a book. To say she was so\r\noccupied is to say that her solitude did not press upon her; for her\r\nlove of knowledge had a fertilising quality and her imagination was\r\nstrong. There was at this time, however, a want of fresh taste in\r\nher situation which the arrival of an unexpected visitor did much to\r\ncorrect. The visitor had not been announced; the girl heard her at last\r\nwalking about the adjoining room. It was in an old house at Albany, a\r\nlarge, square, double house, with a notice of sale in the windows of one\r\nof the lower apartments. There were two entrances, one of which had\r\nlong been out of use but had never been removed. They were exactly\r\nalike--large white doors, with an arched frame and wide side-lights,\r\nperched upon little "stoops" of red stone, which descended sidewise\r\nto the brick pavement of the street. The two houses together formed a\r\nsingle dwelling, the party-wall having been removed and the rooms placed\r\nin communication. These rooms, above-stairs, were extremely numerous,\r\nand were painted all over exactly alike, in a yellowish white which had\r\ngrown sallow with time. On the third floor there was a sort of arched\r\npassage, connecting the two sides of the house, which Isabel and her\r\nsisters used in their childhood to call the tunnel and which, though it\r\nwas short and well lighted, always seemed to the girl to be strange and\r\nlonely, especially on winter afternoons. She had been in the house,\r\nat different periods, as a child; in those days her grandmother lived\r\nthere. Then there had been an absence of ten years, followed by a return\r\nto Albany before her father\'s death. Her grandmother, old Mrs. Archer,\r\nhad exercised, chiefly within the limits of the family, a large\r\nhospitality in the early period, and the little girls often spent weeks\r\nunder her roof--weeks of which Isabel had the happiest memory. The\r\nmanner of life was different from that of her own home--larger, more\r\nplentiful, practically more festal; the discipline of the nursery was\r\ndelightfully vague and the opportunity of listening to the conversation\r\nof one\'s elders (which with Isabel was a highly-valued pleasure) almost\r\nunbounded. There was a constant coming and going; her grandmother\'s\r\nsons and daughters and their children appeared to be in the enjoyment of\r\nstanding invitations to arrive and remain, so that the house offered to\r\na certain extent the appearance of a bustling provincial inn kept by a\r\ngentle old landlady who sighed a great deal and never presented a bill.\r\nIsabel of course knew nothing about bills; but even as a child she\r\nthought her grandmother\'s home romantic. There was a covered piazza\r\nbehind it, furnished with a swing which was a source of tremulous\r\ninterest; and beyond this was a long garden, sloping down to the stable\r\nand containing peach-trees of barely credible familiarity. Isabel had\r\nstayed with her grandmother at various seasons, but somehow all her\r\nvisits had a flavour of peaches. On the other side, across the street,\r\nwas an old house that was called the Dutch House--a peculiar structure\r\ndating from the earliest colonial time, composed of bricks that had been\r\npainted yellow, crowned with a gable that was pointed out to strangers,\r\ndefended by a rickety wooden paling and standing sidewise to the street.\r\nIt was occupied by a primary school for children of both sexes, kept\r\nor rather let go, by a demonstrative lady of whom Isabel\'s chief\r\nrecollection was that her hair was fastened with strange bedroomy combs\r\nat the temples and that she was the widow of some one of consequence.\r\nThe little girl had been offered the opportunity of laying a foundation\r\nof knowledge in this establishment; but having spent a single day in it,\r\nshe had protested against its laws and had been allowed to stay at home,\r\nwhere, in the September days, when the windows of the Dutch House\r\nwere open, she used to hear the hum of childish voices repeating the\r\nmultiplication table--an incident in which the elation of liberty and\r\nthe pain of exclusion were indistinguishably mingled. The foundation\r\nof her knowledge was really laid in the idleness of her grandmother\'s\r\nhouse, where, as most of the other inmates were not reading people,\r\nshe had uncontrolled use of a library full of books with frontispieces,\r\nwhich she used to climb upon a chair to take down. When she had found\r\none to her taste--she was guided in the selection chiefly by the\r\nfrontispiece--she carried it into a mysterious apartment which lay\r\nbeyond the library and which was called, traditionally, no one knew\r\nwhy, the office. Whose office it had been and at what period it had\r\nflourished, she never learned; it was enough for her that it contained\r\nan echo and a pleasant musty smell and that it was a chamber of disgrace\r\nfor old pieces of furniture whose infirmities were not always apparent\r\n(so that the disgrace seemed unmerited and rendered them victims\r\nof injustice) and with which, in the manner of children, she had\r\nestablished relations almost human, certainly dramatic. There was an old\r\nhaircloth sofa in especial, to which she had confided a hundred childish\r\nsorrows. The place owed much of its mysterious melancholy to the fact\r\nthat it was properly entered from the second door of the house, the\r\ndoor that had been condemned, and that it was secured by bolts which a\r\nparticularly slender little girl found it impossible to slide. She\r\nknew that this silent, motionless portal opened into the street; if the\r\nsidelights had not been filled with green paper she might have looked\r\nout upon the little brown stoop and the well-worn brick pavement. But\r\nshe had no wish to look out, for this would have interfered with her\r\ntheory that there was a strange, unseen place on the other side--a place\r\nwhich became to the child\'s imagination, according to its different\r\nmoods, a region of delight or of terror.\r\n\r\nIt was in the "office" still that Isabel was sitting on that melancholy\r\nafternoon of early spring which I have just mentioned. At this time\r\nshe might have had the whole house to choose from, and the room she had\r\nselected was the most depressed of its scenes. She had never opened the\r\nbolted door nor removed the green paper (renewed by other hands) from\r\nits sidelights; she had never assured herself that the vulgar street lay\r\nbeyond. A crude, cold rain fell heavily; the spring-time was indeed an\r\nappeal--and it seemed a cynical, insincere appeal--to patience. Isabel,\r\nhowever, gave as little heed as possible to cosmic treacheries; she kept\r\nher eyes on her book and tried to fix her mind. It had lately occurred\r\nto her that her mind was a good deal of a vagabond, and she had spent\r\nmuch ingenuity in training it to a military step and teaching it\r\nto advance, to halt, to retreat, to perform even more complicated\r\nmanoeuvres, at the word of command. Just now she had given it marching\r\norders and it had been trudging over the sandy plains of a history of\r\nGerman Thought. Suddenly she became aware of a step very different from\r\nher own intellectual pace; she listened a little and perceived that some\r\none was moving in the library, which communicated with the office. It\r\nstruck her first as the step of a person from whom she was looking for a\r\nvisit, then almost immediately announced itself as the tread of a\r\nwoman and a stranger--her possible visitor being neither. It had an\r\ninquisitive, experimental quality which suggested that it would not stop\r\nshort of the threshold of the office; and in fact the doorway of this\r\napartment was presently occupied by a lady who paused there and looked\r\nvery hard at our heroine. She was a plain, elderly woman, dressed in\r\na comprehensive waterproof mantle; she had a face with a good deal of\r\nrather violent point.\r\n\r\n"Oh," she began, "is that where you usually sit?" She looked about at\r\nthe heterogeneous chairs and tables.\r\n\r\n"Not when I have visitors," said Isabel, getting up to receive the\r\nintruder.\r\n\r\nShe directed their course back to the library while the visitor\r\ncontinued to look about her. "You seem to have plenty of other rooms;\r\nthey\'re in rather better condition. But everything\'s immensely worn."\r\n\r\n"Have you come to look at the house?" Isabel asked. "The servant will\r\nshow it to you."\r\n\r\n"Send her away; I don\'t want to buy it. She has probably gone to\r\nlook for you and is wandering about upstairs; she didn\'t seem at all\r\nintelligent. You had better tell her it\'s no matter." And then, since\r\nthe girl stood there hesitating and wondering, this unexpected critic\r\nsaid to her abruptly: "I suppose you\'re one of the daughters?"\r\n\r\nIsabel thought she had very strange manners. "It depends upon whose\r\ndaughters you mean."\r\n\r\n"The late Mr. Archer\'s--and my poor sister\'s."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Isabel slowly, "you must be our crazy Aunt Lydia!"\r\n\r\n"Is that what your father told you to call me? I\'m your Aunt Lydia, but\r\nI\'m not at all crazy: I haven\'t a delusion! And which of the daughters\r\nare you?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m the youngest of the three, and my name\'s Isabel."\r\n\r\n"Yes; the others are Lilian and Edith. And are you the prettiest?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t the least idea," said the girl.\r\n\r\n"I think you must be." And in this way the aunt and the niece made\r\nfriends. The aunt had quarrelled years before with her brother-in-law,\r\nafter the death of her sister, taking him to task for the manner in\r\nwhich he brought up his three girls. Being a high-tempered man he had\r\nrequested her to mind her own business, and she had taken him at his\r\nword. For many years she held no communication with him and after his\r\ndeath had addressed not a word to his daughters, who had been bred in\r\nthat disrespectful view of her which we have just seen Isabel betray.\r\nMrs. Touchett\'s behaviour was, as usual, perfectly deliberate. She\r\nintended to go to America to look after her investments (with which her\r\nhusband, in spite of his great financial position, had nothing to\r\ndo) and would take advantage of this opportunity to enquire into the\r\ncondition of her nieces. There was no need of writing, for she should\r\nattach no importance to any account of them she should elicit by letter;\r\nshe believed, always, in seeing for one\'s self. Isabel found, however,\r\nthat she knew a good deal about them, and knew about the marriage of the\r\ntwo elder girls; knew that their poor father had left very little money,\r\nbut that the house in Albany, which had passed into his hands, was to\r\nbe sold for their benefit; knew, finally, that Edmund Ludlow,\r\nLilian\'s husband, had taken upon himself to attend to this matter, in\r\nconsideration of which the young couple, who had come to Albany during\r\nMr. Archer\'s illness, were remaining there for the present and, as well\r\nas Isabel herself, occupying the old place.\r\n\r\n"How much money do you expect for it?" Mrs. Touchett asked of her\r\ncompanion, who had brought her to sit in the front parlour, which she\r\nhad inspected without enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t the least idea," said the girl.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the second time you have said that to me," her aunt rejoined.\r\n"And yet you don\'t look at all stupid."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not stupid; but I don\'t know anything about money."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s the way you were brought up--as if you were to inherit a\r\nmillion. What have you in point of fact inherited?"\r\n\r\n"I really can\'t tell you. You must ask Edmund and Lilian; they\'ll be\r\nback in half an hour."\r\n\r\n"In Florence we should call it a very bad house," said Mrs. Touchett;\r\n"but here, I dare say, it will bring a high price. It ought to make\r\na considerable sum for each of you. In addition to that you must have\r\nsomething else; it\'s most extraordinary your not knowing. The position\'s\r\nof value, and they\'ll probably pull it down and make a row of shops.\r\nI wonder you don\'t do that yourself; you might let the shops to great\r\nadvantage."\r\n\r\nIsabel stared; the idea of letting shops was new to her. "I hope they\r\nwon\'t pull it down," she said; "I\'m extremely fond of it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see what makes you fond of it; your father died here."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but I don\'t dislike it for that," the girl rather strangely\r\nreturned. "I like places in which things have happened--even if they\'re\r\nsad things. A great many people have died here; the place has been full\r\nof life."\r\n\r\n"Is that what you call being full of life?"\r\n\r\n"I mean full of experience--of people\'s feelings and sorrows. And not of\r\ntheir sorrows only, for I\'ve been very happy here as a child."\r\n\r\n"You should go to Florence if you like houses in which things have\r\nhappened--especially deaths. I live in an old palace in which three\r\npeople have been murdered; three that were known and I don\'t know how\r\nmany more besides."\r\n\r\n"In an old palace?" Isabel repeated.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear; a very different affair from this. This is very\r\nbourgeois."\r\n\r\nIsabel felt some emotion, for she had always thought highly of her\r\ngrandmother\'s house. But the emotion was of a kind which led her to say:\r\n"I should like very much to go to Florence."\r\n\r\n"Well, if you\'ll be very good, and do everything I tell you I\'ll take\r\nyou there," Mrs. Touchett declared.\r\n\r\nOur young woman\'s emotion deepened; she flushed a little and smiled at\r\nher aunt in silence. "Do everything you tell me? I don\'t think I can\r\npromise that."\r\n\r\n"No, you don\'t look like a person of that sort. You\'re fond of your own\r\nway; but it\'s not for me to blame you."\r\n\r\n"And yet, to go to Florence," the girl exclaimed in a moment, "I\'d\r\npromise almost anything!"\r\n\r\nEdmund and Lilian were slow to return, and Mrs. Touchett had an\r\nhour\'s uninterrupted talk with her niece, who found her a strange and\r\ninteresting figure: a figure essentially--almost the first she had ever\r\nmet. She was as eccentric as Isabel had always supposed; and hitherto,\r\nwhenever the girl had heard people described as eccentric, she had\r\nthought of them as offensive or alarming. The term had always suggested\r\nto her something grotesque and even sinister. But her aunt made it a\r\nmatter of high but easy irony, or comedy, and led her to ask herself\r\nif the common tone, which was all she had known, had ever been as\r\ninteresting. No one certainly had on any occasion so held her as this\r\nlittle thin-lipped, bright-eyed, foreign-looking woman, who retrieved an\r\ninsignificant appearance by a distinguished manner and, sitting there in\r\na well-worn waterproof, talked with striking familiarity of the courts\r\nof Europe. There was nothing flighty about Mrs. Touchett, but she\r\nrecognised no social superiors, and, judging the great ones of the earth\r\nin a way that spoke of this, enjoyed the consciousness of making\r\nan impression on a candid and susceptible mind. Isabel at first had\r\nanswered a good many questions, and it was from her answers apparently\r\nthat Mrs. Touchett derived a high opinion of her intelligence. But after\r\nthis she had asked a good many, and her aunt\'s answers, whatever turn\r\nthey took, struck her as food for deep reflexion. Mrs. Touchett waited\r\nfor the return of her other niece as long as she thought reasonable, but\r\nas at six o\'clock Mrs. Ludlow had not come in she prepared to take her\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\n"Your sister must be a great gossip. Is she accustomed to staying out so\r\nmany hours?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been out almost as long as she," Isabel replied; "she can have\r\nleft the house but a short time before you came in."\r\n\r\nMrs. Touchett looked at the girl without resentment; she appeared to\r\nenjoy a bold retort and to be disposed to be gracious. "Perhaps she\r\nhasn\'t had so good an excuse as I. Tell her at any rate that she must\r\ncome and see me this evening at that horrid hotel. She may bring her\r\nhusband if she likes, but she needn\'t bring you. I shall see plenty of\r\nyou later."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nMrs. Ludlow was the eldest of the three sisters, and was usually thought\r\nthe most sensible; the classification being in general that Lilian\r\nwas the practical one, Edith the beauty and Isabel the "intellectual"\r\nsuperior. Mrs. Keyes, the second of the group, was the wife of an\r\nofficer of the United States Engineers, and as our history is not\r\nfurther concerned with her it will suffice that she was indeed very\r\npretty and that she formed the ornament of those various military\r\nstations, chiefly in the unfashionable West, to which, to her deep\r\nchagrin, her husband was successively relegated. Lilian had married a\r\nNew York lawyer, a young man with a loud voice and an enthusiasm for\r\nhis profession; the match was not brilliant, any more than Edith\'s, but\r\nLilian had occasionally been spoken of as a young woman who might be\r\nthankful to marry at all--she was so much plainer than her sisters.\r\nShe was, however, very happy, and now, as the mother of two peremptory\r\nlittle boys and the mistress of a wedge of brown stone violently driven\r\ninto Fifty-third Street, seemed to exult in her condition as in a bold\r\nescape. She was short and solid, and her claim to figure was questioned,\r\nbut she was conceded presence, though not majesty; she had moreover, as\r\npeople said, improved since her marriage, and the two things in life\r\nof which she was most distinctly conscious were her husband\'s force in\r\nargument and her sister Isabel\'s originality. "I\'ve never kept up with\r\nIsabel--it would have taken all my time," she had often remarked;\r\nin spite of which, however, she held her rather wistfully in sight;\r\nwatching her as a motherly spaniel might watch a free greyhound. "I want\r\nto see her safely married--that\'s what I want to see," she frequently\r\nnoted to her husband.\r\n\r\n"Well, I must say I should have no particular desire to marry her,"\r\nEdmund Ludlow was accustomed to answer in an extremely audible tone.\r\n\r\n"I know you say that for argument; you always take the opposite ground.\r\nI don\'t see what you\'ve against her except that she\'s so original."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t like originals; I like translations," Mr. Ludlow had more\r\nthan once replied. "Isabel\'s written in a foreign tongue. I can\'t make\r\nher out. She ought to marry an Armenian or a Portuguese."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I\'m afraid she\'ll do!" cried Lilian, who thought\r\nIsabel capable of anything.\r\n\r\nShe listened with great interest to the girl\'s account of Mrs.\r\nTouchett\'s appearance and in the evening prepared to comply with their\r\naunt\'s commands. Of what Isabel then said no report has remained, but\r\nher sister\'s words had doubtless prompted a word spoken to her husband\r\nas the two were making ready for their visit. "I do hope immensely\r\nshe\'ll do something handsome for Isabel; she has evidently taken a great\r\nfancy to her."\r\n\r\n"What is it you wish her to do?" Edmund Ludlow asked. "Make her a big\r\npresent?"\r\n\r\n"No indeed; nothing of the sort. But take an interest in her--sympathise\r\nwith her. She\'s evidently just the sort of person to appreciate her. She\r\nhas lived so much in foreign society; she told Isabel all about it. You\r\nknow you\'ve always thought Isabel rather foreign."\r\n\r\n"You want her to give her a little foreign sympathy, eh? Don\'t you think\r\nshe gets enough at home?"\r\n\r\n"Well, she ought to go abroad," said Mrs. Ludlow. "She\'s just the person\r\nto go abroad."\r\n\r\n"And you want the old lady to take her, is that it?"\r\n\r\n"She has offered to take her--she\'s dying to have Isabel go. But what\r\nI want her to do when she gets her there is to give her all the\r\nadvantages. I\'m sure all we\'ve got to do," said Mrs. Ludlow, "is to give\r\nher a chance."\r\n\r\n"A chance for what?"\r\n\r\n"A chance to develop."\r\n\r\n"Oh Moses!" Edmund Ludlow exclaimed. "I hope she isn\'t going to develop\r\nany more!"\r\n\r\n"If I were not sure you only said that for argument I should feel very\r\nbadly," his wife replied. "But you know you love her."\r\n\r\n"Do you know I love you?" the young man said, jocosely, to Isabel a\r\nlittle later, while he brushed his hat.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I don\'t care whether you do or not!" exclaimed the girl; whose\r\nvoice and smile, however, were less haughty than her words.\r\n\r\n"Oh, she feels so grand since Mrs. Touchett\'s visit," said her sister.\r\n\r\nBut Isabel challenged this assertion with a good deal of seriousness.\r\n"You must not say that, Lily. I don\'t feel grand at all."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure there\'s no harm," said the conciliatory Lily.\r\n\r\n"Ah, but there\'s nothing in Mrs. Touchett\'s visit to make one feel\r\ngrand."\r\n\r\n"Oh," exclaimed Ludlow, "she\'s grander than ever!"\r\n\r\n"Whenever I feel grand," said the girl, "it will be for a better\r\nreason."\r\n\r\nWhether she felt grand or no, she at any rate felt different, as if\r\nsomething had happened to her. Left to herself for the evening she sat\r\na while under the lamp, her hands empty, her usual avocations unheeded.\r\nThen she rose and moved about the room, and from one room to another,\r\npreferring the places where the vague lamplight expired. She was\r\nrestless and even agitated; at moments she trembled a little. The\r\nimportance of what had happened was out of proportion to its appearance;\r\nthere had really been a change in her life. What it would bring with it\r\nwas as yet extremely indefinite; but Isabel was in a situation that gave\r\na value to any change. She had a desire to leave the past behind her\r\nand, as she said to herself, to begin afresh. This desire indeed was not\r\na birth of the present occasion; it was as familiar as the sound of the\r\nrain upon the window and it had led to her beginning afresh a great many\r\ntimes. She closed her eyes as she sat in one of the dusky corners of the\r\nquiet parlour; but it was not with a desire for dozing forgetfulness. It\r\nwas on the contrary because she felt too wide-eyed and wished to check\r\nthe sense of seeing too many things at once. Her imagination was by\r\nhabit ridiculously active; when the door was not open it jumped out of\r\nthe window. She was not accustomed indeed to keep it behind bolts; and\r\nat important moments, when she would have been thankful to make use\r\nof her judgement alone, she paid the penalty of having given undue\r\nencouragement to the faculty of seeing without judging. At present, with\r\nher sense that the note of change had been struck, came gradually a host\r\nof images of the things she was leaving behind her. The years and hours\r\nof her life came back to her, and for a long time, in a stillness broken\r\nonly by the ticking of the big bronze clock, she passed them in\r\nreview. It had been a very happy life and she had been a very fortunate\r\nperson--this was the truth that seemed to emerge most vividly. She had\r\nhad the best of everything, and in a world in which the circumstances\r\nof so many people made them unenviable it was an advantage never to have\r\nknown anything particularly unpleasant. It appeared to Isabel that the\r\nunpleasant had been even too absent from her knowledge, for she had\r\ngathered from her acquaintance with literature that it was often a\r\nsource of interest and even of instruction. Her father had kept it\r\naway from her--her handsome, much loved father, who always had such\r\nan aversion to it. It was a great felicity to have been his daughter;\r\nIsabel rose even to pride in her parentage. Since his death she had\r\nseemed to see him as turning his braver side to his children and as\r\nnot having managed to ignore the ugly quite so much in practice as in\r\naspiration. But this only made her tenderness for him greater; it\r\nwas scarcely even painful to have to suppose him too generous, too\r\ngood-natured, too indifferent to sordid considerations. Many persons\r\nhad held that he carried this indifference too far, especially the large\r\nnumber of those to whom he owed money. Of their opinions Isabel was\r\nnever very definitely informed; but it may interest the reader to know\r\nthat, while they had recognised in the late Mr. Archer a remarkably\r\nhandsome head and a very taking manner (indeed, as one of them had said,\r\nhe was always taking something), they had declared that he was making a\r\nvery poor use of his life. He had squandered a substantial fortune, he\r\nhad been deplorably convivial, he was known to have gambled freely.\r\nA few very harsh critics went so far as to say that he had not even\r\nbrought up his daughters. They had had no regular education and no\r\npermanent home; they had been at once spoiled and neglected; they had\r\nlived with nursemaids and governesses (usually very bad ones) or had\r\nbeen sent to superficial schools, kept by the French, from which, at the\r\nend of a month, they had been removed in tears. This view of the matter\r\nwould have excited Isabel\'s indignation, for to her own sense her\r\nopportunities had been large. Even when her father had left his\r\ndaughters for three months at Neufchatel with a French _bonne_ who had\r\neloped with a Russian nobleman staying at the same hotel--even in this\r\nirregular situation (an incident of the girl\'s eleventh year) she had\r\nbeen neither frightened nor ashamed, but had thought it a romantic\r\nepisode in a liberal education. Her father had a large way of looking at\r\nlife, of which his restlessness and even his occasional incoherency\r\nof conduct had been only a proof. He wished his daughters, even as\r\nchildren, to see as much of the world as possible; and it was for this\r\npurpose that, before Isabel was fourteen, he had transported them three\r\ntimes across the Atlantic, giving them on each occasion, however, but a\r\nfew months\' view of the subject proposed: a course which had whetted\r\nour heroine\'s curiosity without enabling her to satisfy it. She ought to\r\nhave been a partisan of her father, for she was the member of his trio\r\nwho most "made up" to him for the disagreeables he didn\'t mention. In\r\nhis last days his general willingness to take leave of a world in which\r\nthe difficulty of doing as one liked appeared to increase as one grew\r\nolder had been sensibly modified by the pain of separation from his\r\nclever, his superior, his remarkable girl. Later, when the journeys to\r\nEurope ceased, he still had shown his children all sorts of indulgence,\r\nand if he had been troubled about money-matters nothing ever disturbed\r\ntheir irreflective consciousness of many possessions. Isabel, though she\r\ndanced very well, had not the recollection of having been in New York a\r\nsuccessful member of the choreographic circle; her sister Edith was,\r\nas every one said, so very much more fetching. Edith was so striking\r\nan example of success that Isabel could have no illusions as to what\r\nconstituted this advantage, or as to the limits of her own power to\r\nfrisk and jump and shriek--above all with rightness of effect. Nineteen\r\npersons out of twenty (including the younger sister herself) pronounced\r\nEdith infinitely the prettier of the two; but the twentieth, besides\r\nreversing this judgement, had the entertainment of thinking all the\r\nothers aesthetic vulgarians. Isabel had in the depths of her nature an\r\neven more unquenchable desire to please than Edith; but the depths of\r\nthis young lady\'s nature were a very out-of-the-way place, between which\r\nand the surface communication was interrupted by a dozen capricious\r\nforces. She saw the young men who came in large numbers to see her\r\nsister; but as a general thing they were afraid of her; they had a\r\nbelief that some special preparation was required for talking with her.\r\nHer reputation of reading a great deal hung about her like the cloudy\r\nenvelope of a goddess in an epic; it was supposed to engender difficult\r\nquestions and to keep the conversation at a low temperature. The poor\r\ngirl liked to be thought clever, but she hated to be thought bookish;\r\nshe used to read in secret and, though her memory was excellent, to\r\nabstain from showy reference. She had a great desire for knowledge, but\r\nshe really preferred almost any source of information to the printed\r\npage; she had an immense curiosity about life and was constantly staring\r\nand wondering. She carried within herself a great fund of life, and her\r\ndeepest enjoyment was to feel the continuity between the movements of\r\nher own soul and the agitations of the world. For this reason she was\r\nfond of seeing great crowds and large stretches of country, of reading\r\nabout revolutions and wars, of looking at historical pictures--a class\r\nof efforts as to which she had often committed the conscious solecism of\r\nforgiving them much bad painting for the sake of the subject. While the\r\nCivil War went on she was still a very young girl; but she passed months\r\nof this long period in a state of almost passionate excitement, in which\r\nshe felt herself at times (to her extreme confusion) stirred\r\nalmost indiscriminately by the valour of either army. Of course the\r\ncircumspection of suspicious swains had never gone the length of making\r\nher a social proscript; for the number of those whose hearts, as they\r\napproached her, beat only just fast enough to remind them they had heads\r\nas well, had kept her unacquainted with the supreme disciplines of\r\nher sex and age. She had had everything a girl could have: kindness,\r\nadmiration, bonbons, bouquets, the sense of exclusion from none of the\r\nprivileges of the world she lived in, abundant opportunity for dancing,\r\nplenty of new dresses, the London _Spectator_, the latest publications,\r\nthe music of Gounod, the poetry of Browning, the prose of George Eliot.\r\n\r\nThese things now, as memory played over them, resolved themselves into a\r\nmultitude of scenes and figures. Forgotten things came back to her; many\r\nothers, which she had lately thought of great moment, dropped out of\r\nsight. The result was kaleidoscopic, but the movement of the instrument\r\nwas checked at last by the servant\'s coming in with the name of a\r\ngentleman. The name of the gentleman was Caspar Goodwood; he was a\r\nstraight young man from Boston, who had known Miss Archer for the last\r\ntwelvemonth and who, thinking her the most beautiful young woman of her\r\ntime, had pronounced the time, according to the rule I have hinted at,\r\na foolish period of history. He sometimes wrote to her and had within a\r\nweek or two written from New York. She had thought it very possible he\r\nwould come in--had indeed all the rainy day been vaguely expecting him.\r\nNow that she learned he was there, nevertheless, she felt no eagerness\r\nto receive him. He was the finest young man she had ever seen, was\r\nindeed quite a splendid young man; he inspired her with a sentiment of\r\nhigh, of rare respect. She had never felt equally moved to it by any\r\nother person. He was supposed by the world in general to wish to marry\r\nher, but this of course was between themselves. It at least may be\r\naffirmed that he had travelled from New York to Albany expressly to see\r\nher; having learned in the former city, where he was spending a few\r\ndays and where he had hoped to find her, that she was still at the State\r\ncapital. Isabel delayed for some minutes to go to him; she moved about\r\nthe room with a new sense of complications. But at last she presented\r\nherself and found him standing near the lamp. He was tall, strong and\r\nsomewhat stiff; he was also lean and brown. He was not romantically, he\r\nwas much rather obscurely, handsome; but his physiognomy had an air of\r\nrequesting your attention, which it rewarded according to the charm you\r\nfound in blue eyes of remarkable fixedness, the eyes of a complexion\r\nother than his own, and a jaw of the somewhat angular mould which is\r\nsupposed to bespeak resolution. Isabel said to herself that it bespoke\r\nresolution to-night; in spite of which, in half an hour, Caspar\r\nGoodwood, who had arrived hopeful as well as resolute, took his way back\r\nto his lodging with the feeling of a man defeated. He was not, it may be\r\nadded, a man weakly to accept defeat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nRalph Touchett was a philosopher, but nevertheless he knocked at his\r\nmother\'s door (at a quarter to seven) with a good deal of eagerness.\r\nEven philosophers have their preferences, and it must be admitted\r\nthat of his progenitors his father ministered most to his sense of the\r\nsweetness of filial dependence. His father, as he had often said to\r\nhimself, was the more motherly; his mother, on the other hand, was\r\npaternal, and even, according to the slang of the day, gubernatorial.\r\nShe was nevertheless very fond of her only child and had always insisted\r\non his spending three months of the year with her. Ralph rendered\r\nperfect justice to her affection and knew that in her thoughts and her\r\nthoroughly arranged and servanted life his turn always came after the\r\nother nearest subjects of her solicitude, the various punctualities of\r\nperformance of the workers of her will. He found her completely dressed\r\nfor dinner, but she embraced her boy with her gloved hands and made\r\nhim sit on the sofa beside her. She enquired scrupulously about her\r\nhusband\'s health and about the young man\'s own, and, receiving no\r\nvery brilliant account of either, remarked that she was more than ever\r\nconvinced of her wisdom in not exposing herself to the English climate.\r\nIn this case she also might have given way. Ralph smiled at the idea of\r\nhis mother\'s giving way, but made no point of reminding her that his\r\nown infirmity was not the result of the English climate, from which he\r\nabsented himself for a considerable part of each year.\r\n\r\nHe had been a very small boy when his father, Daniel Tracy Touchett,\r\na native of Rutland, in the State of Vermont, came to England as\r\nsubordinate partner in a banking-house where some ten years later he\r\ngained preponderant control. Daniel Touchett saw before him a life-long\r\nresidence in his adopted country, of which, from the first, he took a\r\nsimple, sane and accommodating view. But, as he said to himself, he had\r\nno intention of disamericanising, nor had he a desire to teach his\r\nonly son any such subtle art. It had been for himself so very soluble a\r\nproblem to live in England assimilated yet unconverted that it seemed to\r\nhim equally simple his lawful heir should after his death carry on the\r\ngrey old bank in the white American light. He was at pains to intensify\r\nthis light, however, by sending the boy home for his education. Ralph\r\nspent several terms at an American school and took a degree at an\r\nAmerican university, after which, as he struck his father on his return\r\nas even redundantly native, he was placed for some three years in\r\nresidence at Oxford. Oxford swallowed up Harvard, and Ralph became\r\nat last English enough. His outward conformity to the manners that\r\nsurrounded him was none the less the mask of a mind that greatly enjoyed\r\nits independence, on which nothing long imposed itself, and which,\r\nnaturally inclined to adventure and irony, indulged in a boundless\r\nliberty of appreciation. He began with being a young man of promise; at\r\nOxford he distinguished himself, to his father\'s ineffable satisfaction,\r\nand the people about him said it was a thousand pities so clever a\r\nfellow should be shut out from a career. He might have had a career\r\nby returning to his own country (though this point is shrouded in\r\nuncertainty) and even if Mr. Touchett had been willing to part with\r\nhim (which was not the case) it would have gone hard with him to put\r\na watery waste permanently between himself and the old man whom he\r\nregarded as his best friend. Ralph was not only fond of his father,\r\nhe admired him--he enjoyed the opportunity of observing him. Daniel\r\nTouchett, to his perception, was a man of genius, and though he himself\r\nhad no aptitude for the banking mystery he made a point of learning\r\nenough of it to measure the great figure his father had played. It was\r\nnot this, however, he mainly relished; it was the fine ivory surface,\r\npolished as by the English air, that the old man had opposed to\r\npossibilities of penetration. Daniel Touchett had been neither at\r\nHarvard nor at Oxford, and it was his own fault if he had placed in his\r\nson\'s hands the key to modern criticism. Ralph, whose head was full\r\nof ideas which his father had never guessed, had a high esteem for the\r\nlatter\'s originality. Americans, rightly or wrongly, are commended for\r\nthe ease with which they adapt themselves to foreign conditions; but Mr.\r\nTouchett had made of the very limits of his pliancy half the ground\r\nof his general success. He had retained in their freshness most of\r\nhis marks of primary pressure; his tone, as his son always noted with\r\npleasure, was that of the more luxuriant parts of New England. At the\r\nend of his life he had become, on his own ground, as mellow as he\r\nwas rich; he combined consummate shrewdness with the disposition\r\nsuperficially to fraternise, and his "social position," on which he had\r\nnever wasted a care, had the firm perfection of an unthumbed fruit. It\r\nwas perhaps his want of imagination and of what is called the historic\r\nconsciousness; but to many of the impressions usually made by English\r\nlife upon the cultivated stranger his sense was completely closed. There\r\nwere certain differences he had never perceived, certain habits he had\r\nnever formed, certain obscurities he had never sounded. As regards these\r\nlatter, on the day he had sounded them his son would have thought less\r\nwell of him.\r\n\r\nRalph, on leaving Oxford, had spent a couple of years in travelling;\r\nafter which he had found himself perched on a high stool in his father\'s\r\nbank. The responsibility and honour of such positions is not, I\r\nbelieve, measured by the height of the stool, which depends upon other\r\nconsiderations: Ralph, indeed, who had very long legs, was fond of\r\nstanding, and even of walking about, at his work. To this exercise,\r\nhowever, he was obliged to devote but a limited period, for at the end\r\nof some eighteen months he had become aware of his being seriously out\r\nof health. He had caught a violent cold, which fixed itself on his lungs\r\nand threw them into dire confusion. He had to give up work and apply,\r\nto the letter, the sorry injunction to take care of himself. At first he\r\nslighted the task; it appeared to him it was not himself in the least\r\nhe was taking care of, but an uninteresting and uninterested person\r\nwith whom he had nothing in common. This person, however, improved\r\non acquaintance, and Ralph grew at last to have a certain grudging\r\ntolerance, even an undemonstrative respect, for him. Misfortune makes\r\nstrange bedfellows, and our young man, feeling that he had something\r\nat stake in the matter--it usually struck him as his reputation for\r\nordinary wit--devoted to his graceless charge an amount of attention of\r\nwhich note was duly taken and which had at least the effect of keeping\r\nthe poor fellow alive. One of his lungs began to heal, the other\r\npromised to follow its example, and he was assured he might outweather\r\na dozen winters if he would betake himself to those climates in which\r\nconsumptives chiefly congregate. As he had grown extremely fond of\r\nLondon, he cursed the flatness of exile: but at the same time that he\r\ncursed he conformed, and gradually, when he found his sensitive organ\r\ngrateful even for grim favours, he conferred them with a lighter hand.\r\nHe wintered abroad, as the phrase is; basked in the sun, stopped at home\r\nwhen the wind blew, went to bed when it rained, and once or twice, when\r\nit had snowed overnight, almost never got up again.\r\n\r\nA secret hoard of indifference--like a thick cake a fond old nurse might\r\nhave slipped into his first school outfit--came to his aid and helped to\r\nreconcile him to sacrifice; since at the best he was too ill for aught\r\nbut that arduous game. As he said to himself, there was really nothing\r\nhe had wanted very much to do, so that he had at least not renounced the\r\nfield of valour. At present, however, the fragrance of forbidden fruit\r\nseemed occasionally to float past him and remind him that the finest of\r\npleasures is the rush of action. Living as he now lived was like reading\r\na good book in a poor translation--a meagre entertainment for a young\r\nman who felt that he might have been an excellent linguist. He had good\r\nwinters and poor winters, and while the former lasted he was sometimes\r\nthe sport of a vision of virtual recovery. But this vision was dispelled\r\nsome three years before the occurrence of the incidents with which this\r\nhistory opens: he had on that occasion remained later than usual in\r\nEngland and had been overtaken by bad weather before reaching Algiers.\r\nHe arrived more dead than alive and lay there for several weeks between\r\nlife and death. His convalescence was a miracle, but the first use he\r\nmade of it was to assure himself that such miracles happen but once. He\r\nsaid to himself that his hour was in sight and that it behoved him to\r\nkeep his eyes upon it, yet that it was also open to him to spend the\r\ninterval as agreeably as might be consistent with such a preoccupation.\r\nWith the prospect of losing them the simple use of his faculties became\r\nan exquisite pleasure; it seemed to him the joys of contemplation had\r\nnever been sounded. He was far from the time when he had found it hard\r\nthat he should be obliged to give up the idea of distinguishing himself;\r\nan idea none the less importunate for being vague and none the less\r\ndelightful for having had to struggle in the same breast with bursts\r\nof inspiring self-criticism. His friends at present judged him more\r\ncheerful, and attributed it to a theory, over which they shook their\r\nheads knowingly, that he would recover his health. His serenity was but\r\nthe array of wild flowers niched in his ruin.\r\n\r\nIt was very probably this sweet-tasting property of the observed thing\r\nin itself that was mainly concerned in Ralph\'s quickly-stirred interest\r\nin the advent of a young lady who was evidently not insipid. If he was\r\nconsideringly disposed, something told him, here was occupation enough\r\nfor a succession of days. It may be added, in summary fashion, that the\r\nimagination of loving--as distinguished from that of being loved--had\r\nstill a place in his reduced sketch. He had only forbidden himself the\r\nriot of expression. However, he shouldn\'t inspire his cousin with a\r\npassion, nor would she be able, even should she try, to help him to one.\r\n"And now tell me about the young lady," he said to his mother. "What do\r\nyou mean to do with her?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Touchett was prompt. "I mean to ask your father to invite her to\r\nstay three or four weeks at Gardencourt."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t stand on any such ceremony as that," said Ralph. "My father\r\nwill ask her as a matter of course."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about that. She\'s my niece; she\'s not his."\r\n\r\n"Good Lord, dear mother; what a sense of property! That\'s all the more\r\nreason for his asking her. But after that--I mean after three months\r\n(for its absurd asking the poor girl to remain but for three or four\r\npaltry weeks)--what do you mean to do with her?"\r\n\r\n"I mean to take her to Paris. I mean to get her clothing."\r\n\r\n"Ah yes, that\'s of course. But independently of that?"\r\n\r\n"I shall invite her to spend the autumn with me in Florence."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t rise above detail, dear mother," said Ralph. "I should like\r\nto know what you mean to do with her in a general way."\r\n\r\n"My duty!" Mrs. Touchett declared. "I suppose you pity her very much,"\r\nshe added.\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t think I pity her. She doesn\'t strike me as inviting\r\ncompassion. I think I envy her. Before being sure, however, give me a\r\nhint of where you see your duty."\r\n\r\n"In showing her four European countries--I shall leave her the choice of\r\ntwo of them--and in giving her the opportunity of perfecting herself in\r\nFrench, which she already knows very well."\r\n\r\nRalph frowned a little. "That sounds rather dry--even allowing her the\r\nchoice of two of the countries."\r\n\r\n"If it\'s dry," said his mother with a laugh, "you can leave Isabel alone\r\nto water it! She is as good as a summer rain, any day."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean she\'s a gifted being?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know whether she\'s a gifted being, but she\'s a clever\r\ngirl--with a strong will and a high temper. She has no idea of being\r\nbored."\r\n\r\n"I can imagine that," said Ralph; and then he added abruptly: "How do\r\nyou two get on?"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean by that that I\'m a bore? I don\'t think she finds me one.\r\nSome girls might, I know; but Isabel\'s too clever for that. I think I\r\ngreatly amuse her. We get on because I understand her, I know the sort\r\nof girl she is. She\'s very frank, and I\'m very frank: we know just what\r\nto expect of each other."\r\n\r\n"Ah, dear mother," Ralph exclaimed, "one always knows what to expect\r\nof you! You\'ve never surprised me but once, and that\'s to-day--in\r\npresenting me with a pretty cousin whose existence I had never\r\nsuspected."\r\n\r\n"Do you think her so very pretty?"\r\n\r\n"Very pretty indeed; but I don\'t insist upon that. It\'s her general\r\nair of being some one in particular that strikes me. Who is this rare\r\ncreature, and what is she? Where did you find her, and how did you make\r\nher acquaintance?"\r\n\r\n"I found her in an old house at Albany, sitting in a dreary room on a\r\nrainy day, reading a heavy book and boring herself to death. She didn\'t\r\nknow she was bored, but when I left her no doubt of it she seemed very\r\ngrateful for the service. You may say I shouldn\'t have enlightened her--I\r\nshould have let her alone. There\'s a good deal in that, but I acted\r\nconscientiously; I thought she was meant for something better. It\r\noccurred to me that it would be a kindness to take her about and\r\nintroduce her to the world. She thinks she knows a great deal of\r\nit--like most American girls; but like most American girls she\'s\r\nridiculously mistaken. If you want to know, I thought she would do me\r\ncredit. I like to be well thought of, and for a woman of my age there\'s\r\nno greater convenience, in some ways, than an attractive niece. You\r\nknow I had seen nothing of my sister\'s children for years; I disapproved\r\nentirely of the father. But I always meant to do something for them when\r\nhe should have gone to his reward. I ascertained where they were to be\r\nfound and, without any preliminaries, went and introduced myself. There\r\nare two others of them, both of whom are married; but I saw only the\r\nelder, who has, by the way, a very uncivil husband. The wife, whose name\r\nis Lily, jumped at the idea of my taking an interest in Isabel; she\r\nsaid it was just what her sister needed--that some one should take\r\nan interest in her. She spoke of her as you might speak of some young\r\nperson of genius--in want of encouragement and patronage. It may be that\r\nIsabel\'s a genius; but in that case I\'ve not yet learned her special\r\nline. Mrs. Ludlow was especially keen about my taking her to Europe;\r\nthey all regard Europe over there as a land of emigration, of rescue, a\r\nrefuge for their superfluous population. Isabel herself seemed very\r\nglad to come, and the thing was easily arranged. There was a little\r\ndifficulty about the money-question, as she seemed averse to being\r\nunder pecuniary obligations. But she has a small income and she supposes\r\nherself to be travelling at her own expense."\r\n\r\nRalph had listened attentively to this judicious report, by which his\r\ninterest in the subject of it was not impaired. "Ah, if she\'s a genius,"\r\nhe said, "we must find out her special line. Is it by chance for\r\nflirting?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think so. You may suspect that at first, but you\'ll be wrong.\r\nYou won\'t, I think, in any way, be easily right about her."\r\n\r\n"Warburton\'s wrong then!" Ralph rejoicingly exclaimed. "He flatters\r\nhimself he has made that discovery."\r\n\r\nHis mother shook her head. "Lord Warburton won\'t understand her. He\r\nneedn\'t try."\r\n\r\n"He\'s very intelligent," said Ralph; "but it\'s right he should be\r\npuzzled once in a while."\r\n\r\n"Isabel will enjoy puzzling a lord," Mrs. Touchett remarked.\r\n\r\nHer son frowned a little. "What does she know about lords?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing at all: that will puzzle him all the more."\r\n\r\nRalph greeted these words with a laugh and looked out of the window.\r\nThen, "Are you not going down to see my father?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"At a quarter to eight," said Mrs. Touchett.\r\n\r\nHer son looked at his watch. "You\'ve another quarter of an hour then.\r\nTell me some more about Isabel." After which, as Mrs. Touchett declined\r\nhis invitation, declaring that he must find out for himself, "Well," he\r\npursued, "she\'ll certainly do you credit. But won\'t she also give you\r\ntrouble?"\r\n\r\n"I hope not; but if she does I shall not shrink from it. I never do\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"She strikes me as very natural," said Ralph.\r\n\r\n"Natural people are not the most trouble."\r\n\r\n"No," said Ralph; "you yourself are a proof of that. You\'re extremely\r\nnatural, and I\'m sure you have never troubled any one. It takes trouble\r\nto do that. But tell me this; it just occurs to me. Is Isabel capable of\r\nmaking herself disagreeable?"\r\n\r\n"Ah," cried his mother, "you ask too many questions! Find that out for\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\nHis questions, however, were not exhausted. "All this time," he said,\r\n"you\'ve not told me what you intend to do with her."\r\n\r\n"Do with her? You talk as if she were a yard of calico. I shall do\r\nabsolutely nothing with her, and she herself will do everything she\r\nchooses. She gave me notice of that."\r\n\r\n"What you meant then, in your telegram, was that her character\'s\r\nindependent."\r\n\r\n"I never know what I mean in my telegrams--especially those I send from\r\nAmerica. Clearness is too expensive. Come down to your father."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not yet a quarter to eight," said Ralph.\r\n\r\n"I must allow for his impatience," Mrs. Touchett answered. Ralph knew\r\nwhat to think of his father\'s impatience; but, making no rejoinder, he\r\noffered his mother his arm. This put it in his power, as they\r\ndescended together, to stop her a moment on the middle landing of the\r\nstaircase--the broad, low, wide-armed staircase of time-blackened oak\r\nwhich was one of the most striking features of Gardencourt. "You\'ve no\r\nplan of marrying her?" he smiled.\r\n\r\n"Marrying her? I should be sorry to play her such a trick! But apart\r\nfrom that, she\'s perfectly able to marry herself. She has every\r\nfacility."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say she has a husband picked out?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about a husband, but there\'s a young man in Boston--!"\r\n\r\nRalph went on; he had no desire to hear about the young man in Boston.\r\n"As my father says, they\'re always engaged!"\r\n\r\nHis mother had told him that he must satisfy his curiosity at the\r\nsource, and it soon became evident he should not want for occasion. He\r\nhad a good deal of talk with his young kinswoman when the two had been\r\nleft together in the drawing-room. Lord Warburton, who had ridden over\r\nfrom his own house, some ten miles distant, remounted and took his\r\ndeparture before dinner; and an hour after this meal was ended Mr. and\r\nMrs. Touchett, who appeared to have quite emptied the measure of their\r\nforms, withdrew, under the valid pretext of fatigue, to their respective\r\napartments. The young man spent an hour with his cousin; though she had\r\nbeen travelling half the day she appeared in no degree spent. She was\r\nreally tired; she knew it, and knew she should pay for it on the morrow;\r\nbut it was her habit at this period to carry exhaustion to the furthest\r\npoint and confess to it only when dissimulation broke down. A fine\r\nhypocrisy was for the present possible; she was interested; she was, as\r\nshe said to herself, floated. She asked Ralph to show her the pictures;\r\nthere were a great many in the house, most of them of his own choosing.\r\nThe best were arranged in an oaken gallery, of charming proportions,\r\nwhich had a sitting-room at either end of it and which in the evening\r\nwas usually lighted. The light was insufficient to show the pictures\r\nto advantage, and the visit might have stood over to the morrow.\r\nThis suggestion Ralph had ventured to make; but Isabel looked\r\ndisappointed--smiling still, however--and said: "If you please I should\r\nlike to see them just a little." She was eager, she knew she was eager\r\nand now seemed so; she couldn\'t help it. "She doesn\'t take suggestions,"\r\nRalph said to himself; but he said it without irritation; her pressure\r\namused and even pleased him. The lamps were on brackets, at intervals,\r\nand if the light was imperfect it was genial. It fell upon the vague\r\nsquares of rich colour and on the faded gilding of heavy frames; it made\r\na sheen on the polished floor of the gallery. Ralph took a candlestick\r\nand moved about, pointing out the things he liked; Isabel, inclining to\r\none picture after another, indulged in little exclamations and murmurs.\r\nShe was evidently a judge; she had a natural taste; he was struck with\r\nthat. She took a candlestick herself and held it slowly here and there;\r\nshe lifted it high, and as she did so he found himself pausing in the\r\nmiddle of the place and bending his eyes much less upon the pictures\r\nthan on her presence. He lost nothing, in truth, by these wandering\r\nglances, for she was better worth looking at than most works of art.\r\nShe was undeniably spare, and ponderably light, and proveably tall; when\r\npeople had wished to distinguish her from the other two Miss Archers\r\nthey had always called her the willowy one. Her hair, which was dark\r\neven to blackness, had been an object of envy to many women; her light\r\ngrey eyes, a little too firm perhaps in her graver moments, had an\r\nenchanting range of concession. They walked slowly up one side of the\r\ngallery and down the other, and then she said: "Well, now I know more\r\nthan I did when I began!"\r\n\r\n"You apparently have a great passion for knowledge," her cousin\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n"I think I have; most girls are horridly ignorant."\r\n\r\n"You strike me as different from most girls."\r\n\r\n"Ah, some of them would--but the way they\'re talked to!" murmured\r\nIsabel, who preferred not to dilate just yet on herself. Then in a\r\nmoment, to change the subject, "Please tell me--isn\'t there a ghost?"\r\nshe went on.\r\n\r\n"A ghost?"\r\n\r\n"A castle-spectre, a thing that appears. We call them ghosts in\r\nAmerica."\r\n\r\n"So we do here, when we see them."\r\n\r\n"You do see them then? You ought to, in this romantic old house."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not a romantic old house," said Ralph. "You\'ll be disappointed if\r\nyou count on that. It\'s a dismally prosaic one; there\'s no romance here\r\nbut what you may have brought with you."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve brought a great deal; but it seems to me I\'ve brought it to the\r\nright place."\r\n\r\n"To keep it out of harm, certainly; nothing will ever happen to it here,\r\nbetween my father and me."\r\n\r\nIsabel looked at him a moment. "Is there never any one here but your\r\nfather and you?"\r\n\r\n"My mother, of course."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know your mother; she\'s not romantic. Haven\'t you other people?"\r\n\r\n"Very few."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry for that; I like so much to see people."\r\n\r\n"Oh, we\'ll invite all the county to amuse you," said Ralph.\r\n\r\n"Now you\'re making fun of me," the girl answered rather gravely. "Who\r\nwas the gentleman on the lawn when I arrived?"\r\n\r\n"A county neighbour; he doesn\'t come very often."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry for that; I liked him," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"Why, it seemed to me that you barely spoke to him," Ralph objected.\r\n\r\n"Never mind, I like him all the same. I like your father too,\r\nimmensely."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t do better than that. He\'s the dearest of the dear."\r\n\r\n"I\'m so sorry he is ill," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"You must help me to nurse him; you ought to be a good nurse."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I am; I\'ve been told I\'m not; I\'m said to have too many\r\ntheories. But you haven\'t told me about the ghost," she added.\r\n\r\nRalph, however, gave no heed to this observation. "You like my father\r\nand you like Lord Warburton. I infer also that you like my mother."\r\n\r\n"I like your mother very much, because--because--" And Isabel found\r\nherself attempting to assign a reason for her affection for Mrs.\r\nTouchett.\r\n\r\n"Ah, we never know why!" said her companion, laughing.\r\n\r\n"I always know why," the girl answered. "It\'s because she doesn\'t expect\r\none to like her. She doesn\'t care whether one does or not."\r\n\r\n"So you adore her--out of perversity? Well, I take greatly after my\r\nmother," said Ralph.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe you do at all. You wish people to like you, and you try\r\nto make them do it."\r\n\r\n"Good heavens, how you see through one!" he cried with a dismay that was\r\nnot altogether jocular.\r\n\r\n"But I like you all the same," his cousin went on. "The way to clinch\r\nthe matter will be to show me the ghost."\r\n\r\nRalph shook his head sadly. "I might show it to you, but you\'d never see\r\nit. The privilege isn\'t given to every one; it\'s not enviable. It has\r\nnever been seen by a young, happy, innocent person like you. You must\r\nhave suffered first, have suffered greatly, have gained some miserable\r\nknowledge. In that way your eyes are opened to it. I saw it long ago,"\r\nsaid Ralph.\r\n\r\n"I told you just now I\'m very fond of knowledge," Isabel answered.\r\n\r\n"Yes, of happy knowledge--of pleasant knowledge. But you haven\'t\r\nsuffered, and you\'re not made to suffer. I hope you\'ll never see the\r\nghost!"\r\n\r\nShe had listened to him attentively, with a smile on her lips, but with\r\na certain gravity in her eyes. Charming as he found her, she had struck\r\nhim as rather presumptuous--indeed it was a part of her charm; and he\r\nwondered what she would say. "I\'m not afraid, you know," she said: which\r\nseemed quite presumptuous enough.\r\n\r\n"You\'re not afraid of suffering?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m afraid of suffering. But I\'m not afraid of ghosts. And I think\r\npeople suffer too easily," she added.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe you do," said Ralph, looking at her with his hands in\r\nhis pockets.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that\'s a fault," she answered. "It\'s not absolutely\r\nnecessary to suffer; we were not made for that."\r\n\r\n"You were not, certainly."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not speaking of myself." And she wandered off a little.\r\n\r\n"No, it isn\'t a fault," said her cousin. "It\'s a merit to be strong."\r\n\r\n"Only, if you don\'t suffer they call you hard," Isabel remarked.\r\n\r\nThey passed out of the smaller drawing-room, into which they had\r\nreturned from the gallery, and paused in the hall, at the foot of the\r\nstaircase. Here Ralph presented his companion with her bedroom candle,\r\nwhich he had taken from a niche. "Never mind what they call you. When\r\nyou do suffer they call you an idiot. The great point\'s to be as happy\r\nas possible."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him a little; she had taken her candle and placed her foot\r\non the oaken stair. "Well," she said, "that\'s what I came to Europe for,\r\nto be as happy as possible. Good-night."\r\n\r\n"Good-night! I wish you all success, and shall be very glad to\r\ncontribute to it!"\r\n\r\nShe turned away, and he watched her as she slowly ascended. Then, with\r\nhis hands always in his pockets, he went back to the empty drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nIsabel Archer was a young person of many theories; her imagination was\r\nremarkably active. It had been her fortune to possess a finer mind\r\nthan most of the persons among whom her lot was cast; to have a larger\r\nperception of surrounding facts and to care for knowledge that was\r\ntinged with the unfamiliar. It is true that among her contemporaries\r\nshe passed for a young woman of extraordinary profundity; for these\r\nexcellent people never withheld their admiration from a reach of\r\nintellect of which they themselves were not conscious, and spoke of\r\nIsabel as a prodigy of learning, a creature reported to have read the\r\nclassic authors--in translations. Her paternal aunt, Mrs. Varian, once\r\nspread the rumour that Isabel was writing a book--Mrs. Varian having a\r\nreverence for books, and averred that the girl would distinguish herself\r\nin print. Mrs. Varian thought highly of literature, for which she\r\nentertained that esteem that is connected with a sense of privation.\r\nHer own large house, remarkable for its assortment of mosaic tables and\r\ndecorated ceilings, was unfurnished with a library, and in the way of\r\nprinted volumes contained nothing but half a dozen novels in paper on\r\na shelf in the apartment of one of the Miss Varians. Practically, Mrs.\r\nVarian\'s acquaintance with literature was confined to The New York\r\n_Interviewer_; as she very justly said, after you had read the _Interviewer_\r\nyou had lost all faith in culture. Her tendency, with this, was rather\r\nto keep the _Interviewer_ out of the way of her daughters; she was\r\ndetermined to bring them up properly, and they read nothing at all. Her\r\nimpression with regard to Isabel\'s labours was quite illusory; the girl\r\nhad never attempted to write a book and had no desire for the laurels\r\nof authorship. She had no talent for expression and too little of the\r\nconsciousness of genius; she only had a general idea that people were\r\nright when they treated her as if she were rather superior. Whether or\r\nno she were superior, people were right in admiring her if they thought\r\nher so; for it seemed to her often that her mind moved more quickly\r\nthan theirs, and this encouraged an impatience that might easily be\r\nconfounded with superiority. It may be affirmed without delay that\r\nIsabel was probably very liable to the sin of self-esteem; she often\r\nsurveyed with complacency the field of her own nature; she was in the\r\nhabit of taking for granted, on scanty evidence, that she was right;\r\nshe treated herself to occasions of homage. Meanwhile her errors and\r\ndelusions were frequently such as a biographer interested in preserving\r\nthe dignity of his subject must shrink from specifying. Her thoughts\r\nwere a tangle of vague outlines which had never been corrected by the\r\njudgement of people speaking with authority. In matters of opinion\r\nshe had had her own way, and it had led her into a thousand ridiculous\r\nzigzags. At moments she discovered she was grotesquely wrong, and then\r\nshe treated herself to a week of passionate humility. After this she\r\nheld her head higher than ever again; for it was of no use, she had an\r\nunquenchable desire to think well of herself. She had a theory that it\r\nwas only under this provision life was worth living; that one should\r\nbe one of the best, should be conscious of a fine organisation (she\r\ncouldn\'t help knowing her organisation was fine), should move in a realm\r\nof light, of natural wisdom, of happy impulse, of inspiration gracefully\r\nchronic. It was almost as unnecessary to cultivate doubt of one\'s self\r\nas to cultivate doubt of one\'s best friend: one should try to be one\'s\r\nown best friend and to give one\'s self, in this manner, distinguished\r\ncompany. The girl had a certain nobleness of imagination which rendered\r\nher a good many services and played her a great many tricks. She spent\r\nhalf her time in thinking of beauty and bravery and magnanimity; she had\r\na fixed determination to regard the world as a place of brightness, of\r\nfree expansion, of irresistible action: she held it must be detestable\r\nto be afraid or ashamed. She had an infinite hope that she should never\r\ndo anything wrong. She had resented so strongly, after discovering them,\r\nher mere errors of feeling (the discovery always made her tremble as if\r\nshe had escaped from a trap which might have caught her and smothered\r\nher) that the chance of inflicting a sensible injury upon another\r\nperson, presented only as a contingency, caused her at moments to hold\r\nher breath. That always struck her as the worst thing that could happen\r\nto her. On the whole, reflectively, she was in no uncertainty about\r\nthe things that were wrong. She had no love of their look, but when\r\nshe fixed them hard she recognised them. It was wrong to be mean, to be\r\njealous, to be false, to be cruel; she had seen very little of the evil\r\nof the world, but she had seen women who lied and who tried to hurt\r\neach other. Seeing such things had quickened her high spirit; it seemed\r\nindecent not to scorn them. Of course the danger of a high spirit was\r\nthe danger of inconsistency--the danger of keeping up the flag after the\r\nplace has surrendered; a sort of behaviour so crooked as to be almost\r\na dishonour to the flag. But Isabel, who knew little of the sorts of\r\nartillery to which young women are exposed, flattered herself that such\r\ncontradictions would never be noted in her own conduct. Her life should\r\nalways be in harmony with the most pleasing impression she should\r\nproduce; she would be what she appeared, and she would appear what she\r\nwas. Sometimes she went so far as to wish that she might find herself\r\nsome day in a difficult position, so that she should have the pleasure\r\nof being as heroic as the occasion demanded. Altogether, with her meagre\r\nknowledge, her inflated ideals, her confidence at once innocent and\r\ndogmatic, her temper at once exacting and indulgent, her mixture of\r\ncuriosity and fastidiousness, of vivacity and indifference, her desire\r\nto look very well and to be if possible even better, her determination\r\nto see, to try, to know, her combination of the delicate, desultory,\r\nflame-like spirit and the eager and personal creature of conditions: she\r\nwould be an easy victim of scientific criticism if she were not intended\r\nto awaken on the reader\'s part an impulse more tender and more purely\r\nexpectant.\r\n\r\nIt was one of her theories that Isabel Archer was very fortunate in\r\nbeing independent, and that she ought to make some very enlightened use\r\nof that state. She never called it the state of solitude, much less of\r\nsingleness; she thought such descriptions weak, and, besides, her sister\r\nLily constantly urged her to come and abide. She had a friend whose\r\nacquaintance she had made shortly before her father\'s death, who offered\r\nso high an example of useful activity that Isabel always thought of her\r\nas a model. Henrietta Stackpole had the advantage of an admired ability;\r\nshe was thoroughly launched in journalism, and her letters to the\r\n_Interviewer_, from Washington, Newport, the White Mountains and other\r\nplaces, were universally quoted. Isabel pronounced them with confidence\r\n"ephemeral," but she esteemed the courage, energy and good-humour of the\r\nwriter, who, without parents and without property, had adopted three\r\nof the children of an infirm and widowed sister and was paying their\r\nschool-bills out of the proceeds of her literary labour. Henrietta was\r\nin the van of progress and had clear-cut views on most subjects; her\r\ncherished desire had long been to come to Europe and write a series of\r\nletters to the _Interviewer_ from the radical point of view--an enterprise\r\nthe less difficult as she knew perfectly in advance what her opinions\r\nwould be and to how many objections most European institutions lay\r\nopen. When she heard that Isabel was coming she wished to start at once;\r\nthinking, naturally, that it would be delightful the two should travel\r\ntogether. She had been obliged, however, to postpone this enterprise.\r\nShe thought Isabel a glorious creature, and had spoken of her covertly\r\nin some of her letters, though she never mentioned the fact to her\r\nfriend, who would not have taken pleasure in it and was not a regular\r\nstudent of the _Interviewer_. Henrietta, for Isabel, was chiefly a proof\r\nthat a woman might suffice to herself and be happy. Her resources were\r\nof the obvious kind; but even if one had not the journalistic talent and\r\na genius for guessing, as Henrietta said, what the public was going to\r\nwant, one was not therefore to conclude that one had no vocation,\r\nno beneficent aptitude of any sort, and resign one\'s self to being\r\nfrivolous and hollow. Isabel was stoutly determined not to be hollow. If\r\none should wait with the right patience one would find some happy work\r\nto one\'s hand. Of course, among her theories, this young lady was not\r\nwithout a collection of views on the subject of marriage. The first on\r\nthe list was a conviction of the vulgarity of thinking too much of it.\r\nFrom lapsing into eagerness on this point she earnestly prayed she might\r\nbe delivered; she held that a woman ought to be able to live to herself,\r\nin the absence of exceptional flimsiness, and that it was perfectly\r\npossible to be happy without the society of a more or less coarse-minded\r\nperson of another sex. The girl\'s prayer was very sufficiently answered;\r\nsomething pure and proud that there was in her--something cold and dry\r\nan unappreciated suitor with a taste for analysis might have called\r\nit--had hitherto kept her from any great vanity of conjecture on the\r\narticle of possible husbands. Few of the men she saw seemed worth a\r\nruinous expenditure, and it made her smile to think that one of them\r\nshould present himself as an incentive to hope and a reward of patience.\r\nDeep in her soul--it was the deepest thing there--lay a belief that if\r\na certain light should dawn she could give herself completely; but\r\nthis image, on the whole, was too formidable to be attractive. Isabel\'s\r\nthoughts hovered about it, but they seldom rested on it long; after a\r\nlittle it ended in alarms. It often seemed to her that she thought too\r\nmuch about herself; you could have made her colour, any day in the\r\nyear, by calling her a rank egoist. She was always planning out her\r\ndevelopment, desiring her perfection, observing her progress. Her nature\r\nhad, in her conceit, a certain garden-like quality, a suggestion of\r\nperfume and murmuring boughs, of shady bowers and lengthening vistas,\r\nwhich made her feel that introspection was, after all, an exercise\r\nin the open air, and that a visit to the recesses of one\'s spirit was\r\nharmless when one returned from it with a lapful of roses. But she was\r\noften reminded that there were other gardens in the world than those of\r\nher remarkable soul, and that there were moreover a great many places\r\nwhich were not gardens at all--only dusky pestiferous tracts, planted\r\nthick with ugliness and misery. In the current of that repaid curiosity\r\non which she had lately been floating, which had conveyed her to this\r\nbeautiful old England and might carry her much further still, she often\r\nchecked herself with the thought of the thousands of people who were\r\nless happy than herself--a thought which for the moment made her fine,\r\nfull consciousness appear a kind of immodesty. What should one do with\r\nthe misery of the world in a scheme of the agreeable for one\'s self? It\r\nmust be confessed that this question never held her long. She was too\r\nyoung, too impatient to live, too unacquainted with pain. She always\r\nreturned to her theory that a young woman whom after all every one\r\nthought clever should begin by getting a general impression of life.\r\nThis impression was necessary to prevent mistakes, and after it should\r\nbe secured she might make the unfortunate condition of others a subject\r\nof special attention.\r\n\r\nEngland was a revelation to her, and she found herself as diverted as a\r\nchild at a pantomime. In her infantine excursions to Europe she had\r\nseen only the Continent, and seen it from the nursery window; Paris, not\r\nLondon, was her father\'s Mecca, and into many of his interests there his\r\nchildren had naturally not entered. The images of that time moreover had\r\ngrown faint and remote, and the old-world quality in everything that\r\nshe now saw had all the charm of strangeness. Her uncle\'s house seemed a\r\npicture made real; no refinement of the agreeable was lost upon\r\nIsabel; the rich perfection of Gardencourt at once revealed a world and\r\ngratified a need. The large, low rooms, with brown ceilings and dusky\r\ncorners, the deep embrasures and curious casements, the quiet light on\r\ndark, polished panels, the deep greenness outside, that seemed always\r\npeeping in, the sense of well-ordered privacy in the centre of a\r\n"property"--a place where sounds were felicitously accidental, where\r\nthe tread was muffed by the earth itself and in the thick mild air all\r\nfriction dropped out of contact and all shrillness out of talk--these\r\nthings were much to the taste of our young lady, whose taste played a\r\nconsiderable part in her emotions. She formed a fast friendship with her\r\nuncle, and often sat by his chair when he had had it moved out to the\r\nlawn. He passed hours in the open air, sitting with folded hands like\r\na placid, homely household god, a god of service, who had done his work\r\nand received his wages and was trying to grow used to weeks and months\r\nmade up only of off-days. Isabel amused him more than she suspected--the\r\neffect she produced upon people was often different from what she\r\nsupposed--and he frequently gave himself the pleasure of making her\r\nchatter. It was by this term that he qualified her conversation, which\r\nhad much of the "point" observable in that of the young ladies of her\r\ncountry, to whom the ear of the world is more directly presented than to\r\ntheir sisters in other lands. Like the mass of American girls Isabel had\r\nbeen encouraged to express herself; her remarks had been attended\r\nto; she had been expected to have emotions and opinions. Many of her\r\nopinions had doubtless but a slender value, many of her emotions passed\r\naway in the utterance; but they had left a trace in giving her the habit\r\nof seeming at least to feel and think, and in imparting moreover to\r\nher words when she was really moved that prompt vividness which so many\r\npeople had regarded as a sign of superiority. Mr. Touchett used to think\r\nthat she reminded him of his wife when his wife was in her teens. It was\r\nbecause she was fresh and natural and quick to understand, to speak--so\r\nmany characteristics of her niece--that he had fallen in love with Mrs.\r\nTouchett. He never expressed this analogy to the girl herself, however;\r\nfor if Mrs. Touchett had once been like Isabel, Isabel was not at all\r\nlike Mrs. Touchett. The old man was full of kindness for her; it was a\r\nlong time, as he said, since they had had any young life in the house;\r\nand our rustling, quickly-moving, clear-voiced heroine was as agreeable\r\nto his sense as the sound of flowing water. He wanted to do something\r\nfor her and wished she would ask it of him. She would ask nothing but\r\nquestions; it is true that of these she asked a quantity. Her uncle had\r\na great fund of answers, though her pressure sometimes came in forms\r\nthat puzzled him. She questioned him immensely about England, about the\r\nBritish constitution, the English character, the state of politics,\r\nthe manners and customs of the royal family, the peculiarities of the\r\naristocracy, the way of living and thinking of his neighbours; and in\r\nbegging to be enlightened on these points she usually enquired whether\r\nthey corresponded with the descriptions in the books. The old man always\r\nlooked at her a little with his fine dry smile while he smoothed down\r\nthe shawl spread across his legs.\r\n\r\n"The books?" he once said; "well, I don\'t know much about the books. You\r\nmust ask Ralph about that. I\'ve always ascertained for myself--got my\r\ninformation in the natural form. I never asked many questions even;\r\nI just kept quiet and took notice. Of course I\'ve had very good\r\nopportunities--better than what a young lady would naturally have. I\'m\r\nof an inquisitive disposition, though you mightn\'t think it if you were\r\nto watch me: however much you might watch me I should be watching you\r\nmore. I\'ve been watching these people for upwards of thirty-five years,\r\nand I don\'t hesitate to say that I\'ve acquired considerable information.\r\nIt\'s a very fine country on the whole--finer perhaps than what we give\r\nit credit for on the other side. Several improvements I should like to\r\nsee introduced; but the necessity of them doesn\'t seem to be generally\r\nfelt as yet. When the necessity of a thing is generally felt they\r\nusually manage to accomplish it; but they seem to feel pretty\r\ncomfortable about waiting till then. I certainly feel more at home among\r\nthem than I expected to when I first came over; I suppose it\'s because\r\nI\'ve had a considerable degree of success. When you\'re successful you\r\nnaturally feel more at home."\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose that if I\'m successful I shall feel at home?" Isabel\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"I should think it very probable, and you certainly will be successful.\r\nThey like American young ladies very much over here; they show them\r\na great deal of kindness. But you mustn\'t feel too much at home, you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m by no means sure it will satisfy me," Isabel judicially\r\nemphasised. "I like the place very much, but I\'m not sure I shall like\r\nthe people."\r\n\r\n"The people are very good people; especially if you like them."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no doubt they\'re good," Isabel rejoined; "but are they pleasant\r\nin society? They won\'t rob me nor beat me; but will they make themselves\r\nagreeable to me? That\'s what I like people to do. I don\'t hesitate to\r\nsay so, because I always appreciate it. I don\'t believe they\'re very\r\nnice to girls; they\'re not nice to them in the novels."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about the novels," said Mr. Touchett. "I believe the\r\nnovels have a great deal but I don\'t suppose they\'re very accurate.\r\nWe once had a lady who wrote novels staying here; she was a friend\r\nof Ralph\'s and he asked her down. She was very positive, quite up to\r\neverything; but she was not the sort of person you could depend on\r\nfor evidence. Too free a fancy--I suppose that was it. She afterwards\r\npublished a work of fiction in which she was understood to have given\r\na representation--something in the nature of a caricature, as you might\r\nsay--of my unworthy self. I didn\'t read it, but Ralph just handed me\r\nthe book with the principal passages marked. It was understood to be\r\na description of my conversation; American peculiarities, nasal twang,\r\nYankee notions, stars and stripes. Well, it was not at all accurate;\r\nshe couldn\'t have listened very attentively. I had no objection to her\r\ngiving a report of my conversation, if she liked but I didn\'t like the\r\nidea that she hadn\'t taken the trouble to listen to it. Of course I talk\r\nlike an American--I can\'t talk like a Hottentot. However I talk, I\'ve\r\nmade them understand me pretty well over here. But I don\'t talk like the\r\nold gentleman in that lady\'s novel. He wasn\'t an American; we wouldn\'t\r\nhave him over there at any price. I just mention that fact to show you\r\nthat they\'re not always accurate. Of course, as I\'ve no daughters,\r\nand as Mrs. Touchett resides in Florence, I haven\'t had much chance\r\nto notice about the young ladies. It sometimes appears as if the young\r\nwomen in the lower class were not very well treated; but I guess their\r\nposition is better in the upper and even to some extent in the middle."\r\n\r\n"Gracious," Isabel exclaimed; "how many classes have they? About fifty,\r\nI suppose."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know that I ever counted them. I never took much notice\r\nof the classes. That\'s the advantage of being an American here; you\r\ndon\'t belong to any class."\r\n\r\n"I hope so," said Isabel. "Imagine one\'s belonging to an English class!"\r\n\r\n"Well, I guess some of them are pretty comfortable--especially towards\r\nthe top. But for me there are only two classes: the people I trust and\r\nthe people I don\'t. Of those two, my dear Isabel, you belong to the\r\nfirst."\r\n\r\n"I\'m much obliged to you," said the girl quickly. Her way of taking\r\ncompliments seemed sometimes rather dry; she got rid of them as rapidly\r\nas possible. But as regards this she was sometimes misjudged; she was\r\nthought insensible to them, whereas in fact she was simply unwilling to\r\nshow how infinitely they pleased her. To show that was to show too much.\r\n"I\'m sure the English are very conventional," she added.\r\n\r\n"They\'ve got everything pretty well fixed," Mr. Touchett admitted. "It\'s\r\nall settled beforehand--they don\'t leave it to the last moment."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like to have everything settled beforehand," said the girl. "I\r\nlike more unexpectedness."\r\n\r\nHer uncle seemed amused at her distinctness of preference. "Well, it\'s\r\nsettled beforehand that you\'ll have great success," he rejoined. "I\r\nsuppose you\'ll like that."\r\n\r\n"I shall not have success if they\'re too stupidly conventional. I\'m not\r\nin the least stupidly conventional. I\'m just the contrary. That\'s what\r\nthey won\'t like."\r\n\r\n"No, no, you\'re all wrong," said the old man. "You can\'t tell what\r\nthey\'ll like. They\'re very inconsistent; that\'s their principal\r\ninterest."\r\n\r\n"Ah well," said Isabel, standing before her uncle with her hands\r\nclasped about the belt of her black dress and looking up and down the\r\nlawn--"that will suit me perfectly!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nThe two amused themselves, time and again, with talking of the attitude\r\nof the British public as if the young lady had been in a position to\r\nappeal to it; but in fact the British public remained for the present\r\nprofoundly indifferent to Miss Isabel Archer, whose fortune had dropped\r\nher, as her cousin said, into the dullest house in England. Her gouty\r\nuncle received very little company, and Mrs. Touchett, not having\r\ncultivated relations with her husband\'s neighbours, was not warranted\r\nin expecting visits from them. She had, however, a peculiar taste; she\r\nliked to receive cards. For what is usually called social intercourse\r\nshe had very little relish; but nothing pleased her more than to find\r\nher hall-table whitened with oblong morsels of symbolic pasteboard. She\r\nflattered herself that she was a very just woman, and had mastered the\r\nsovereign truth that nothing in this world is got for nothing. She had\r\nplayed no social part as mistress of Gardencourt, and it was not to be\r\nsupposed that, in the surrounding country, a minute account should be\r\nkept of her comings and goings. But it is by no means certain that she\r\ndid not feel it to be wrong that so little notice was taken of them and\r\nthat her failure (really very gratuitous) to make herself important in\r\nthe neighbourhood had not much to do with the acrimony of her allusions\r\nto her husband\'s adopted country. Isabel presently found herself in the\r\nsingular situation of defending the British constitution against her\r\naunt; Mrs. Touchett having formed the habit of sticking pins into this\r\nvenerable instrument. Isabel always felt an impulse to pull out the\r\npins; not that she imagined they inflicted any damage on the tough old\r\nparchment, but because it seemed to her her aunt might make better use\r\nof her sharpness. She was very critical herself--it was incidental to\r\nher age, her sex and her nationality; but she was very sentimental as\r\nwell, and there was something in Mrs. Touchett\'s dryness that set her\r\nown moral fountains flowing.\r\n\r\n"Now what\'s your point of view?" she asked of her aunt. "When you\r\ncriticise everything here you should have a point of view. Yours doesn\'t\r\nseem to be American--you thought everything over there so disagreeable.\r\nWhen I criticise I have mine; it\'s thoroughly American!"\r\n\r\n"My dear young lady," said Mrs. Touchett, "there are as many points of\r\nview in the world as there are people of sense to take them. You may\r\nsay that doesn\'t make them very numerous! American? Never in the world;\r\nthat\'s shockingly narrow. My point of view, thank God, is personal!"\r\n\r\nIsabel thought this a better answer than she admitted; it was a\r\ntolerable description of her own manner of judging, but it would not\r\nhave sounded well for her to say so. On the lips of a person less\r\nadvanced in life and less enlightened by experience than Mrs. Touchett\r\nsuch a declaration would savour of immodesty, even of arrogance. She\r\nrisked it nevertheless in talking with Ralph, with whom she talked a\r\ngreat deal and with whom her conversation was of a sort that gave a\r\nlarge licence to extravagance. Her cousin used, as the phrase is, to\r\nchaff her; he very soon established with her a reputation for treating\r\neverything as a joke, and he was not a man to neglect the privileges\r\nsuch a reputation conferred. She accused him of an odious want of\r\nseriousness, of laughing at all things, beginning with himself. Such\r\nslender faculty of reverence as he possessed centred wholly upon his\r\nfather; for the rest, he exercised his wit indifferently upon his\r\nfather\'s son, this gentleman\'s weak lungs, his useless life, his\r\nfantastic mother, his friends (Lord Warburton in especial), his adopted,\r\nand his native country, his charming new-found cousin. "I keep a band\r\nof music in my ante-room," he said once to her. "It has orders to play\r\nwithout stopping; it renders me two excellent services. It keeps the\r\nsounds of the world from reaching the private apartments, and it makes\r\nthe world think that dancing\'s going on within." It was dance-music\r\nindeed that you usually heard when you came within ear-shot of Ralph\'s\r\nband; the liveliest waltzes seemed to float upon the air. Isabel often\r\nfound herself irritated by this perpetual fiddling; she would have liked\r\nto pass through the ante-room, as her cousin called it, and enter the\r\nprivate apartments. It mattered little that he had assured her they were\r\na very dismal place; she would have been glad to undertake to sweep them\r\nand set them in order. It was but half-hospitality to let her remain\r\noutside; to punish him for which Isabel administered innumerable taps\r\nwith the ferule of her straight young wit. It must be said that her wit\r\nwas exercised to a large extent in self-defence, for her cousin amused\r\nhimself with calling her "Columbia" and accusing her of a patriotism so\r\nheated that it scorched. He drew a caricature of her in which she was\r\nrepresented as a very pretty young woman dressed, on the lines of the\r\nprevailing fashion, in the folds of the national banner. Isabel\'s chief\r\ndread in life at this period of her development was that she should\r\nappear narrow-minded; what she feared next afterwards was that she\r\nshould really be so. But she nevertheless made no scruple of abounding\r\nin her cousin\'s sense and pretending to sigh for the charms of her\r\nnative land. She would be as American as it pleased him to regard her,\r\nand if he chose to laugh at her she would give him plenty of occupation.\r\nShe defended England against his mother, but when Ralph sang its praises\r\non purpose, as she said, to work her up, she found herself able to\r\ndiffer from him on a variety of points. In fact, the quality of this\r\nsmall ripe country seemed as sweet to her as the taste of an October\r\npear; and her satisfaction was at the root of the good spirits which\r\nenabled her to take her cousin\'s chaff and return it in kind. If her\r\ngood-humour flagged at moments it was not because she thought herself\r\nill-used, but because she suddenly felt sorry for Ralph. It seemed to\r\nher he was talking as a blind and had little heart in what he said. "I\r\ndon\'t know what\'s the matter with you," she observed to him once; "but I\r\nsuspect you\'re a great humbug."\r\n\r\n"That\'s your privilege," Ralph answered, who had not been used to being\r\nso crudely addressed.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you care for; I don\'t think you care for anything.\r\nYou don\'t really care for England when you praise it; you don\'t care for\r\nAmerica even when you pretend to abuse it."\r\n\r\n"I care for nothing but you, dear cousin," said Ralph.\r\n\r\n"If I could believe even that, I should be very glad."\r\n\r\n"Ah well, I should hope so!" the young man exclaimed.\r\n\r\nIsabel might have believed it and not have been far from the truth. He\r\nthought a great deal about her; she was constantly present to his mind.\r\nAt a time when his thoughts had been a good deal of a burden to him her\r\nsudden arrival, which promised nothing and was an open-handed gift of\r\nfate, had refreshed and quickened them, given them wings and something\r\nto fly for. Poor Ralph had been for many weeks steeped in melancholy;\r\nhis outlook, habitually sombre, lay under the shadow of a deeper cloud.\r\nHe had grown anxious about his father, whose gout, hitherto confined to\r\nhis legs, had begun to ascend into regions more vital. The old man had\r\nbeen gravely ill in the spring, and the doctors had whispered to\r\nRalph that another attack would be less easy to deal with. Just now\r\nhe appeared disburdened of pain, but Ralph could not rid himself of a\r\nsuspicion that this was a subterfuge of the enemy, who was waiting to\r\ntake him off his guard. If the manoeuvre should succeed there would be\r\nlittle hope of any great resistance. Ralph had always taken for granted\r\nthat his father would survive him--that his own name would be the first\r\ngrimly called. The father and son had been close companions, and the\r\nidea of being left alone with the remnant of a tasteless life on his\r\nhands was not gratifying to the young man, who had always and tacitly\r\ncounted upon his elder\'s help in making the best of a poor business.\r\nAt the prospect of losing his great motive Ralph lost indeed his one\r\ninspiration. If they might die at the same time it would be all very\r\nwell; but without the encouragement of his father\'s society he should\r\nbarely have patience to await his own turn. He had not the incentive of\r\nfeeling that he was indispensable to his mother; it was a rule with his\r\nmother to have no regrets. He bethought himself of course that it had\r\nbeen a small kindness to his father to wish that, of the two, the active\r\nrather than the passive party should know the felt wound; he remembered\r\nthat the old man had always treated his own forecast of an early end as\r\na clever fallacy, which he should be delighted to discredit so far as\r\nhe might by dying first. But of the two triumphs, that of refuting a\r\nsophistical son and that of holding on a while longer to a state of\r\nbeing which, with all abatements, he enjoyed, Ralph deemed it no sin to\r\nhope the latter might be vouchsafed to Mr. Touchett.\r\n\r\nThese were nice questions, but Isabel\'s arrival put a stop to his\r\npuzzling over them. It even suggested there might be a compensation for\r\nthe intolerable _ennui_ of surviving his genial sire. He wondered whether\r\nhe were harbouring "love" for this spontaneous young woman from Albany;\r\nbut he judged that on the whole he was not. After he had known her for\r\na week he quite made up his mind to this, and every day he felt a little\r\nmore sure. Lord Warburton had been right about her; she was a really\r\ninteresting little figure. Ralph wondered how their neighbour had\r\nfound it out so soon; and then he said it was only another proof of his\r\nfriend\'s high abilities, which he had always greatly admired. If his\r\ncousin were to be nothing more than an entertainment to him, Ralph was\r\nconscious she was an entertainment of a high order. "A character like\r\nthat," he said to himself--"a real little passionate force to see at\r\nplay is the finest thing in nature. It\'s finer than the finest work\r\nof art--than a Greek bas-relief, than a great Titian, than a Gothic\r\ncathedral. It\'s very pleasant to be so well treated where one had least\r\nlooked for it. I had never been more blue, more bored, than for a week\r\nbefore she came; I had never expected less that anything pleasant would\r\nhappen. Suddenly I receive a Titian, by the post, to hang on my wall--a\r\nGreek bas-relief to stick over my chimney-piece. The key of a beautiful\r\nedifice is thrust into my hand, and I\'m told to walk in and admire. My\r\npoor boy, you\'ve been sadly ungrateful, and now you had better keep very\r\nquiet and never grumble again." The sentiment of these reflexions was\r\nvery just; but it was not exactly true that Ralph Touchett had had a key\r\nput into his hand. His cousin was a very brilliant girl, who would take,\r\nas he said, a good deal of knowing; but she needed the knowing, and his\r\nattitude with regard to her, though it was contemplative and critical,\r\nwas not judicial. He surveyed the edifice from the outside and admired\r\nit greatly; he looked in at the windows and received an impression of\r\nproportions equally fair. But he felt that he saw it only by glimpses\r\nand that he had not yet stood under the roof. The door was fastened, and\r\nthough he had keys in his pocket he had a conviction that none of them\r\nwould fit. She was intelligent and generous; it was a fine free nature;\r\nbut what was she going to do with herself? This question was irregular,\r\nfor with most women one had no occasion to ask it. Most women did\r\nwith themselves nothing at all; they waited, in attitudes more or less\r\ngracefully passive, for a man to come that way and furnish them with\r\na destiny. Isabel\'s originality was that she gave one an impression of\r\nhaving intentions of her own. "Whenever she executes them," said Ralph,\r\n"may I be there to see!"\r\n\r\nIt devolved upon him of course to do the honours of the place. Mr.\r\nTouchett was confined to his chair, and his wife\'s position was that of\r\nrather a grim visitor; so that in the line of conduct that opened itself\r\nto Ralph duty and inclination were harmoniously mixed. He was not a\r\ngreat walker, but he strolled about the grounds with his cousin--a\r\npastime for which the weather remained favourable with a persistency not\r\nallowed for in Isabel\'s somewhat lugubrious prevision of the climate;\r\nand in the long afternoons, of which the length was but the measure of\r\nher gratified eagerness, they took a boat on the river, the dear little\r\nriver, as Isabel called it, where the opposite shore seemed still a\r\npart of the foreground of the landscape; or drove over the country in a\r\nphaeton--a low, capacious, thick-wheeled phaeton formerly much used by\r\nMr. Touchett, but which he had now ceased to enjoy. Isabel enjoyed it\r\nlargely and, handling the reins in a manner which approved itself to\r\nthe groom as "knowing," was never weary of driving her uncle\'s capital\r\nhorses through winding lanes and byways full of the rural incidents she\r\nhad confidently expected to find; past cottages thatched and timbered,\r\npast ale-houses latticed and sanded, past patches of ancient common and\r\nglimpses of empty parks, between hedgerows made thick by midsummer. When\r\nthey reached home they usually found tea had been served on the lawn\r\nand that Mrs. Touchett had not shrunk from the extremity of handing her\r\nhusband his cup. But the two for the most part sat silent; the old\r\nman with his head back and his eyes closed, his wife occupied with her\r\nknitting and wearing that appearance of rare profundity with which some\r\nladies consider the movement of their needles.\r\n\r\nOne day, however, a visitor had arrived. The two young persons, after\r\nspending an hour on the river, strolled back to the house and perceived\r\nLord Warburton sitting under the trees and engaged in conversation, of\r\nwhich even at a distance the desultory character was appreciable, with\r\nMrs. Touchett. He had driven over from his own place with a portmanteau\r\nand had asked, as the father and son often invited him to do, for a\r\ndinner and a lodging. Isabel, seeing him for half an hour on the day of\r\nher arrival, had discovered in this brief space that she liked him; he\r\nhad indeed rather sharply registered himself on her fine sense and\r\nshe had thought of him several times. She had hoped she should see him\r\nagain--hoped too that she should see a few others. Gardencourt was not\r\ndull; the place itself was sovereign, her uncle was more and more a\r\nsort of golden grandfather, and Ralph was unlike any cousin she had\r\never encountered--her idea of cousins having tended to gloom. Then her\r\nimpressions were still so fresh and so quickly renewed that there was as\r\nyet hardly a hint of vacancy in the view. But Isabel had need to remind\r\nherself that she was interested in human nature and that her foremost\r\nhope in coming abroad had been that she should see a great many people.\r\nWhen Ralph said to her, as he had done several times, "I wonder you find\r\nthis endurable; you ought to see some of the neighbours and some of\r\nour friends, because we have really got a few, though you would never\r\nsuppose it"--when he offered to invite what he called a "lot of people"\r\nand make her acquainted with English society, she encouraged the\r\nhospitable impulse and promised in advance to hurl herself into the\r\nfray. Little, however, for the present, had come of his offers, and it\r\nmay be confided to the reader that if the young man delayed to carry\r\nthem out it was because he found the labour of providing for his\r\ncompanion by no means so severe as to require extraneous help. Isabel\r\nhad spoken to him very often about "specimens;" it was a word that\r\nplayed a considerable part in her vocabulary; she had given him to\r\nunderstand that she wished to see English society illustrated by eminent\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n"Well now, there\'s a specimen," he said to her as they walked up from\r\nthe riverside and he recognised Lord Warburton.\r\n\r\n"A specimen of what?" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n"A specimen of an English gentleman."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean they\'re all like him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no; they\'re not all like him."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a favourable specimen then," said Isabel; "because I\'m sure he\'s\r\nnice."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he\'s very nice. And he\'s very fortunate."\r\n\r\nThe fortunate Lord Warburton exchanged a handshake with our heroine\r\nand hoped she was very well. "But I needn\'t ask that," he said, "since\r\nyou\'ve been handling the oars."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been rowing a little," Isabel answered; "but how should you know\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know he doesn\'t row; he\'s too lazy," said his lordship,\r\nindicating Ralph Touchett with a laugh.\r\n\r\n"He has a good excuse for his laziness," Isabel rejoined, lowering her\r\nvoice a little.\r\n\r\n"Ah, he has a good excuse for everything!" cried Lord Warburton, still\r\nwith his sonorous mirth.\r\n\r\n"My excuse for not rowing is that my cousin rows so well," said Ralph.\r\n"She does everything well. She touches nothing that she doesn\'t adorn!"\r\n\r\n"It makes one want to be touched, Miss Archer," Lord Warburton declared.\r\n\r\n"Be touched in the right sense and you\'ll never look the worse for\r\nit," said Isabel, who, if it pleased her to hear it said that her\r\naccomplishments were numerous, was happily able to reflect that such\r\ncomplacency was not the indication of a feeble mind, inasmuch as there\r\nwere several things in which she excelled. Her desire to think well of\r\nherself had at least the element of humility that it always needed to be\r\nsupported by proof.\r\n\r\nLord Warburton not only spent the night at Gardencourt, but he was\r\npersuaded to remain over the second day; and when the second day was\r\nended he determined to postpone his departure till the morrow. During\r\nthis period he addressed many of his remarks to Isabel, who accepted\r\nthis evidence of his esteem with a very good grace. She found herself\r\nliking him extremely; the first impression he had made on her had had\r\nweight, but at the end of an evening spent in his society she scarce\r\nfell short of seeing him--though quite without luridity--as a hero\r\nof romance. She retired to rest with a sense of good fortune, with a\r\nquickened consciousness of possible felicities. "It\'s very nice to know\r\ntwo such charming people as those," she said, meaning by "those" her\r\ncousin and her cousin\'s friend. It must be added moreover that an\r\nincident had occurred which might have seemed to put her good-humour to\r\nthe test. Mr. Touchett went to bed at half-past nine o\'clock, but his\r\nwife remained in the drawing-room with the other members of the party.\r\nShe prolonged her vigil for something less than an hour, and then,\r\nrising, observed to Isabel that it was time they should bid the\r\ngentlemen good-night. Isabel had as yet no desire to go to bed; the\r\noccasion wore, to her sense, a festive character, and feasts were not\r\nin the habit of terminating so early. So, without further thought, she\r\nreplied, very simply--\r\n\r\n"Need I go, dear aunt? I\'ll come up in half an hour."\r\n\r\n"It\'s impossible I should wait for you," Mrs. Touchett answered.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you needn\'t wait! Ralph will light my candle," Isabel gaily\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll light your candle; do let me light your candle, Miss Archer!" Lord\r\nWarburton exclaimed. "Only I beg it shall not be before midnight."\r\n\r\nMrs. Touchett fixed her bright little eyes upon him a moment and\r\ntransferred them coldly to her niece. "You can\'t stay alone with the\r\ngentlemen. You\'re not--you\'re not at your blest Albany, my dear."\r\n\r\nIsabel rose, blushing. "I wish I were," she said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I say, mother!" Ralph broke out.\r\n\r\n"My dear Mrs. Touchett!" Lord Warburton murmured.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t make your country, my lord," Mrs. Touchett said majestically.\r\n"I must take it as I find it."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t I stay with my own cousin?" Isabel enquired.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not aware that Lord Warburton is your cousin."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I had better go to bed!" the visitor suggested. "That will\r\narrange it."\r\n\r\nMrs. Touchett gave a little look of despair and sat down again. "Oh, if\r\nit\'s necessary I\'ll stay up till midnight."\r\n\r\nRalph meanwhile handed Isabel her candlestick. He had been watching her;\r\nit had seemed to him her temper was involved--an accident that might\r\nbe interesting. But if he had expected anything of a flare he was\r\ndisappointed, for the girl simply laughed a little, nodded good-night\r\nand withdrew accompanied by her aunt. For himself he was annoyed at his\r\nmother, though he thought she was right. Above-stairs the two ladies\r\nseparated at Mrs. Touchett\'s door. Isabel had said nothing on her way\r\nup.\r\n\r\n"Of course you\'re vexed at my interfering with you," said Mrs. Touchett.\r\n\r\nIsabel considered. "I\'m not vexed, but I\'m surprised--and a good deal\r\nmystified. Wasn\'t it proper I should remain in the drawing-room?"\r\n\r\n"Not in the least. Young girls here--in decent houses--don\'t sit alone\r\nwith the gentlemen late at night."\r\n\r\n"You were very right to tell me then," said Isabel. "I don\'t understand\r\nit, but I\'m very glad to know it.\r\n\r\n"I shall always tell you," her aunt answered, "whenever I see you taking\r\nwhat seems to me too much liberty."\r\n\r\n"Pray do; but I don\'t say I shall always think your remonstrance just."\r\n\r\n"Very likely not. You\'re too fond of your own ways."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think I\'m very fond of them. But I always want to know the\r\nthings one shouldn\'t do."\r\n\r\n"So as to do them?" asked her aunt.\r\n\r\n"So as to choose," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nAs she was devoted to romantic effects Lord Warburton ventured to\r\nexpress a hope that she would come some day and see his house, a very\r\ncurious old place. He extracted from Mrs. Touchett a promise that she\r\nwould bring her niece to Lockleigh, and Ralph signified his willingness\r\nto attend the ladies if his father should be able to spare him. Lord\r\nWarburton assured our heroine that in the mean time his sisters would\r\ncome and see her. She knew something about his sisters, having sounded\r\nhim, during the hours they spent together while he was at Gardencourt,\r\non many points connected with his family. When Isabel was interested she\r\nasked a great many questions, and as her companion was a copious talker\r\nshe urged him on this occasion by no means in vain. He told her he\r\nhad four sisters and two brothers and had lost both his parents. The\r\nbrothers and sisters were very good people--"not particularly clever,\r\nyou know," he said, "but very decent and pleasant;" and he was so good\r\nas to hope Miss Archer might know them well. One of the brothers was in\r\nthe Church, settled in the family living, that of Lockleigh, which was\r\na heavy, sprawling parish, and was an excellent fellow in spite of his\r\nthinking differently from himself on every conceivable topic. And then\r\nLord Warburton mentioned some of the opinions held by his brother, which\r\nwere opinions Isabel had often heard expressed and that she supposed to\r\nbe entertained by a considerable portion of the human family. Many of\r\nthem indeed she supposed she had held herself, till he assured her\r\nshe was quite mistaken, that it was really impossible, that she had\r\ndoubtless imagined she entertained them, but that she might depend that,\r\nif she thought them over a little, she would find there was nothing\r\nin them. When she answered that she had already thought several of the\r\nquestions involved over very attentively he declared that she was only\r\nanother example of what he had often been struck with--the fact that,\r\nof all the people in the world, the Americans were the most grossly\r\nsuperstitious. They were rank Tories and bigots, every one of them;\r\nthere were no conservatives like American conservatives. Her uncle and\r\nher cousin were there to prove it; nothing could be more medieval than\r\nmany of their views; they had ideas that people in England nowadays were\r\nashamed to confess to; and they had the impudence moreover, said his\r\nlordship, laughing, to pretend they knew more about the needs and\r\ndangers of this poor dear stupid old England than he who was born in it\r\nand owned a considerable slice of it--the more shame to him! From all of\r\nwhich Isabel gathered that Lord Warburton was a nobleman of the newest\r\npattern, a reformer, a radical, a contemner of ancient ways. His other\r\nbrother, who was in the army in India, was rather wild and pig-headed\r\nand had not been of much use as yet but to make debts for Warburton to\r\npay--one of the most precious privileges of an elder brother. "I don\'t\r\nthink I shall pay any more," said her friend; "he lives a monstrous deal\r\nbetter than I do, enjoys unheard-of luxuries and thinks himself a much\r\nfiner gentleman than I. As I\'m a consistent radical I go in only for\r\nequality; I don\'t go in for the superiority of the younger brothers."\r\nTwo of his four sisters, the second and fourth, were married, one of\r\nthem having done very well, as they said, the other only so-so.\r\nThe husband of the elder, Lord Haycock, was a very good fellow, but\r\nunfortunately a horrid Tory; and his wife, like all good English wives,\r\nwas worse than her husband. The other had espoused a smallish squire\r\nin Norfolk and, though married but the other day, had already five\r\nchildren. This information and much more Lord Warburton imparted to his\r\nyoung American listener, taking pains to make many things clear and to\r\nlay bare to her apprehension the peculiarities of English life. Isabel\r\nwas often amused at his explicitness and at the small allowance he\r\nseemed to make either for her own experience or for her imagination. "He\r\nthinks I\'m a barbarian," she said, "and that I\'ve never seen forks and\r\nspoons;" and she used to ask him artless questions for the pleasure of\r\nhearing him answer seriously. Then when he had fallen into the trap,\r\n"It\'s a pity you can\'t see me in my war-paint and feathers," she\r\nremarked; "if I had known how kind you are to the poor savages I would\r\nhave brought over my native costume!" Lord Warburton had travelled\r\nthrough the United States and knew much more about them than Isabel; he\r\nwas so good as to say that America was the most charming country in the\r\nworld, but his recollections of it appeared to encourage the idea that\r\nAmericans in England would need to have a great many things explained\r\nto them. "If I had only had you to explain things to me in America!"\r\nhe said. "I was rather puzzled in your country; in fact I was quite\r\nbewildered, and the trouble was that the explanations only puzzled me\r\nmore. You know I think they often gave me the wrong ones on purpose;\r\nthey\'re rather clever about that over there. But when I explain you\r\ncan trust me; about what I tell you there\'s no mistake." There was no\r\nmistake at least about his being very intelligent and cultivated and\r\nknowing almost everything in the world. Although he gave the most\r\ninteresting and thrilling glimpses Isabel felt he never did it to\r\nexhibit himself, and though he had had rare chances and had tumbled in,\r\nas she put it, for high prizes, he was as far as possible from making\r\na merit of it. He had enjoyed the best things of life, but they had not\r\nspoiled his sense of proportion. His quality was a mixture of the effect\r\nof rich experience--oh, so easily come by!--with a modesty at times\r\nalmost boyish; the sweet and wholesome savour of which--it was as\r\nagreeable as something tasted--lost nothing from the addition of a tone\r\nof responsible kindness.\r\n\r\n"I like your specimen English gentleman very much," Isabel said to Ralph\r\nafter Lord Warburton had gone.\r\n\r\n"I like him too--I love him well," Ralph returned. "But I pity him\r\nmore."\r\n\r\nIsabel looked at him askance. "Why, that seems to me his only\r\nfault--that one can\'t pity him a little. He appears to have everything,\r\nto know everything, to be everything."\r\n\r\n"Oh, he\'s in a bad way!" Ralph insisted.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you don\'t mean in health?"\r\n\r\n"No, as to that he\'s detestably sound. What I mean is that he\'s a man\r\nwith a great position who\'s playing all sorts of tricks with it. He\r\ndoesn\'t take himself seriously."\r\n\r\n"Does he regard himself as a joke?"\r\n\r\n"Much worse; he regards himself as an imposition--as an abuse."\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps he is," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he is--though on the whole I don\'t think so. But in that case\r\nwhat\'s more pitiable than a sentient, self-conscious abuse planted by\r\nother hands, deeply rooted but aching with a sense of its injustice?\r\nFor me, in his place, I could be as solemn as a statue of Buddha.\r\nHe occupies a position that appeals to my imagination. Great\r\nresponsibilities, great opportunities, great consideration, great\r\nwealth, great power, a natural share in the public affairs of a great\r\ncountry. But he\'s all in a muddle about himself, his position, his\r\npower, and indeed about everything in the world. He\'s the victim of a\r\ncritical age; he has ceased to believe in himself and he doesn\'t know\r\nwhat to believe in. When I attempt to tell him (because if I were he I\r\nknow very well what I should believe in) he calls me a pampered bigot.\r\nI believe he seriously thinks me an awful Philistine; he says I don\'t\r\nunderstand my time. I understand it certainly better than he, who\r\ncan neither abolish himself as a nuisance nor maintain himself as an\r\ninstitution."\r\n\r\n"He doesn\'t look very wretched," Isabel observed.\r\n\r\n"Possibly not; though, being a man of a good deal of charming taste, I\r\nthink he often has uncomfortable hours. But what is it to say of a being\r\nof his opportunities that he\'s not miserable? Besides, I believe he is."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"Well," her cousin rejoined, "if he isn\'t he ought to be!"\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon she spent an hour with her uncle on the lawn, where the\r\nold man sat, as usual, with his shawl over his legs and his large cup\r\nof diluted tea in his hands. In the course of conversation he asked her\r\nwhat she thought of their late visitor.\r\n\r\nIsabel was prompt. "I think he\'s charming."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a nice person," said Mr. Touchett, "but I don\'t recommend you to\r\nfall in love with him."\r\n\r\n"I shall not do it then; I shall never fall in love but on your\r\nrecommendation. Moreover," Isabel added, "my cousin gives me rather a\r\nsad account of Lord Warburton."\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed? I don\'t know what there may be to say, but you must\r\nremember that Ralph must talk."\r\n\r\n"He thinks your friend\'s too subversive--or not subversive enough! I\r\ndon\'t quite understand which," said Isabel.\r\n\r\nThe old man shook his head slowly, smiled and put down his cup. "I don\'t\r\nknow which either. He goes very far, but it\'s quite possible he doesn\'t\r\ngo far enough. He seems to want to do away with a good many things, but\r\nhe seems to want to remain himself. I suppose that\'s natural, but it\'s\r\nrather inconsistent."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I hope he\'ll remain himself," said Isabel. "If he were to be done\r\naway with his friends would miss him sadly."\r\n\r\n"Well," said the old man, "I guess he\'ll stay and amuse his friends.\r\nI should certainly miss him very much here at Gardencourt. He always\r\namuses me when he comes over, and I think he amuses himself as well.\r\nThere\'s a considerable number like him, round in society; they\'re very\r\nfashionable just now. I don\'t know what they\'re trying to do--whether\r\nthey\'re trying to get up a revolution. I hope at any rate they\'ll put it\r\noff till after I\'m gone. You see they want to disestablish everything;\r\nbut I\'m a pretty big landowner here, and I don\'t want to be\r\ndisestablished. I wouldn\'t have come over if I had thought they\r\nwere going to behave like that," Mr. Touchett went on with expanding\r\nhilarity. "I came over because I thought England was a safe country. I\r\ncall it a regular fraud if they are going to introduce any considerable\r\nchanges; there\'ll be a large number disappointed in that case."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I do hope they\'ll make a revolution!" Isabel exclaimed. "I should\r\ndelight in seeing a revolution."\r\n\r\n"Let me see," said her uncle, with a humorous intention; "I forget\r\nwhether you\'re on the side of the old or on the side of the new. I\'ve\r\nheard you take such opposite views."\r\n\r\n"I\'m on the side of both. I guess I\'m a little on the side of\r\neverything. In a revolution--after it was well begun--I think I should\r\nbe a high, proud loyalist. One sympathises more with them, and they\'ve a\r\nchance to behave so exquisitely. I mean so picturesquely."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that I understand what you mean by behaving picturesquely,\r\nbut it seems to me that you do that always, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you lovely man, if I could believe that!" the girl interrupted.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid, after all, you won\'t have the pleasure of going gracefully\r\nto the guillotine here just now," Mr. Touchett went on. "If you want to\r\nsee a big outbreak you must pay us a long visit. You see, when you come\r\nto the point it wouldn\'t suit them to be taken at their word."\r\n\r\n"Of whom are you speaking?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I mean Lord Warburton and his friends--the radicals of the upper\r\nclass. Of course I only know the way it strikes me. They talk about the\r\nchanges, but I don\'t think they quite realise. You and I, you know, we\r\nknow what it is to have lived under democratic institutions: I always\r\nthought them very comfortable, but I was used to them from the first.\r\nAnd then I ain\'t a lord; you\'re a lady, my dear, but I ain\'t a lord. Now\r\nover here I don\'t think it quite comes home to them. It\'s a matter of\r\nevery day and every hour, and I don\'t think many of them would find it\r\nas pleasant as what they\'ve got. Of course if they want to try, it\'s\r\ntheir own business; but I expect they won\'t try very hard."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think they\'re sincere?" Isabel asked.\r\n\r\n"Well, they want to _feel_ earnest," Mr. Touchett allowed; "but it seems\r\nas if they took it out in theories mostly. Their radical views are a\r\nkind of amusement; they\'ve got to have some amusement, and they might\r\nhave coarser tastes than that. You see they\'re very luxurious, and these\r\nprogressive ideas are about their biggest luxury. They make them feel\r\nmoral and yet don\'t damage their position. They think a great deal of\r\ntheir position; don\'t let one of them ever persuade you he doesn\'t, for\r\nif you were to proceed on that basis you\'d be pulled up very short."\r\n\r\nIsabel followed her uncle\'s argument, which he unfolded with his quaint\r\ndistinctness, most attentively, and though she was unacquainted with the\r\nBritish aristocracy she found it in harmony with her general impressions\r\nof human nature. But she felt moved to put in a protest on Lord\r\nWarburton\'s behalf. "I don\'t believe Lord Warburton\'s a humbug; I don\'t\r\ncare what the others are. I should like to see Lord Warburton put to the\r\ntest."\r\n\r\n"Heaven deliver me from my friends!" Mr. Touchett answered. "Lord\r\nWarburton\'s a very amiable young man--a very fine young man. He has a\r\nhundred thousand a year. He owns fifty thousand acres of the soil of\r\nthis little island and ever so many other things besides. He has half a\r\ndozen houses to live in. He has a seat in Parliament as I have one at my\r\nown dinner-table. He has elegant tastes--cares for literature, for art,\r\nfor science, for charming young ladies. The most elegant is his taste\r\nfor the new views. It affords him a great deal of pleasure--more\r\nperhaps than anything else, except the young ladies. His old house over\r\nthere--what does he call it, Lockleigh?--is very attractive; but I don\'t\r\nthink it\'s as pleasant as this. That doesn\'t matter, however--he has\r\nso many others. His views don\'t hurt any one as far as I can see; they\r\ncertainly don\'t hurt himself. And if there were to be a revolution he\r\nwould come off very easily. They wouldn\'t touch him, they\'d leave him as\r\nhe is: he\'s too much liked."\r\n\r\n"Ah, he couldn\'t be a martyr even if he wished!" Isabel sighed. "That\'s\r\na very poor position."\r\n\r\n"He\'ll never be a martyr unless you make him one," said the old man.\r\n\r\nIsabel shook her head; there might have been something laughable in the\r\nfact that she did it with a touch of melancholy. "I shall never make any\r\none a martyr."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll never be one, I hope."\r\n\r\n"I hope not. But you don\'t pity Lord Warburton then as Ralph does?"\r\n\r\nHer uncle looked at her a while with genial acuteness. "Yes, I do, after\r\nall!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nThe two Misses Molyneux, this nobleman\'s sisters, came presently to call\r\nupon her, and Isabel took a fancy to the young ladies, who appeared to\r\nher to show a most original stamp. It is true that when she described\r\nthem to her cousin by that term he declared that no epithet could be\r\nless applicable than this to the two Misses Molyneux, since there\r\nwere fifty thousand young women in England who exactly resembled them.\r\nDeprived of this advantage, however, Isabel\'s visitors retained that\r\nof an extreme sweetness and shyness of demeanour, and of having, as\r\nshe thought, eyes like the balanced basins, the circles of "ornamental\r\nwater," set, in parterres, among the geraniums.\r\n\r\n"They\'re not morbid, at any rate, whatever they are," our heroine said\r\nto herself; and she deemed this a great charm, for two or three of the\r\nfriends of her girlhood had been regrettably open to the charge (they\r\nwould have been so nice without it), to say nothing of Isabel\'s having\r\noccasionally suspected it as a tendency of her own. The Misses Molyneux\r\nwere not in their first youth, but they had bright, fresh complexions\r\nand something of the smile of childhood. Yes, their eyes, which Isabel\r\nadmired, were round, quiet and contented, and their figures, also of a\r\ngenerous roundness, were encased in sealskin jackets. Their friendliness\r\nwas great, so great that they were almost embarrassed to show it; they\r\nseemed somewhat afraid of the young lady from the other side of the\r\nworld and rather looked than spoke their good wishes. But they made it\r\nclear to her that they hoped she would come to luncheon at Lockleigh,\r\nwhere they lived with their brother, and then they might see her very,\r\nvery often. They wondered if she wouldn\'t come over some day, and sleep:\r\nthey were expecting some people on the twenty-ninth, so perhaps she\r\nwould come while the people were there.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid it isn\'t any one very remarkable," said the elder sister;\r\n"but I dare say you\'ll take us as you find us."\r\n\r\n"I shall find you delightful; I think you\'re enchanting just as you\r\nare," replied Isabel, who often praised profusely.\r\n\r\nHer visitors flushed, and her cousin told her, after they were gone,\r\nthat if she said such things to those poor girls they would think she\r\nwas in some wild, free manner practising on them: he was sure it was the\r\nfirst time they had been called enchanting.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help it," Isabel answered. "I think it\'s lovely to be so quiet\r\nand reasonable and satisfied. I should like to be like that."\r\n\r\n"Heaven forbid!" cried Ralph with ardour.\r\n\r\n"I mean to try and imitate them," said Isabel. "I want very much to see\r\nthem at home."\r\n\r\nShe had this pleasure a few days later, when, with Ralph and his mother,\r\nshe drove over to Lockleigh. She found the Misses Molyneux sitting in a\r\nvast drawing-room (she perceived afterwards it was one of several) in a\r\nwilderness of faded chintz; they were dressed on this occasion in black\r\nvelveteen. Isabel liked them even better at home than she had done at\r\nGardencourt, and was more than ever struck with the fact that they were\r\nnot morbid. It had seemed to her before that if they had a fault it was\r\na want of play of mind; but she presently saw they were capable of deep\r\nemotion. Before luncheon she was alone with them for some time, on one\r\nside of the room, while Lord Warburton, at a distance, talked to Mrs.\r\nTouchett.\r\n\r\n"Is it true your brother\'s such a great radical?" Isabel asked. She\r\nknew it was true, but we have seen that her interest in human nature was\r\nkeen, and she had a desire to draw the Misses Molyneux out.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, yes; he\'s immensely advanced," said Mildred, the younger\r\nsister.\r\n\r\n"At the same time Warburton\'s very reasonable," Miss Molyneux observed.\r\n\r\nIsabel watched him a moment at the other side of the room; he was\r\nclearly trying hard to make himself agreeable to Mrs. Touchett. Ralph\r\nhad met the frank advances of one of the dogs before the fire that the\r\ntemperature of an English August, in the ancient expanses, had not\r\nmade an impertinence. "Do you suppose your brother\'s sincere?" Isabel\r\nenquired with a smile.\r\n\r\n"Oh, he must be, you know!" Mildred exclaimed quickly, while the elder\r\nsister gazed at our heroine in silence.\r\n\r\n"Do you think he would stand the test?"\r\n\r\n"The test?"\r\n\r\n"I mean for instance having to give up all this."\r\n\r\n"Having to give up Lockleigh?" said Miss Molyneux, finding her voice.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and the other places; what are they called?"\r\n\r\nThe two sisters exchanged an almost frightened glance. "Do you mean--do\r\nyou mean on account of the expense?" the younger one asked.\r\n\r\n"I dare say he might let one or two of his houses," said the other.\r\n\r\n"Let them for nothing?" Isabel demanded.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t fancy his giving up his property," said Miss Molyneux.\r\n\r\n"Ah, I\'m afraid he is an impostor!" Isabel returned. "Don\'t you think\r\nit\'s a false position?"\r\n\r\nHer companions, evidently, had lost themselves. "My brother\'s position?"\r\nMiss Molyneux enquired.\r\n\r\n"It\'s thought a very good position," said the younger sister. "It\'s the\r\nfirst position in this part of the county."\r\n\r\n"I dare say you think me very irreverent," Isabel took occasion to\r\nremark. "I suppose you revere your brother and are rather afraid of\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Of course one looks up to one\'s brother," said Miss Molyneux simply.\r\n\r\n"If you do that he must be very good--because you, evidently, are\r\nbeautifully good."\r\n\r\n"He\'s most kind. It will never be known, the good he does."\r\n\r\n"His ability is known," Mildred added; "every one thinks it\'s immense."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I can see that," said Isabel. "But if I were he I should wish to\r\nfight to the death: I mean for the heritage of the past. I should hold\r\nit tight."\r\n\r\n"I think one ought to be liberal," Mildred argued gently. "We\'ve always\r\nbeen so, even from the earliest times."\r\n\r\n"Ah well," said Isabel, "you\'ve made a great success of it; I don\'t\r\nwonder you like it. I see you\'re very fond of crewels."\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Warburton showed her the house, after luncheon, it seemed to\r\nher a matter of course that it should be a noble picture. Within, it\r\nhad been a good deal modernised--some of its best points had lost their\r\npurity; but as they saw it from the gardens, a stout grey pile, of the\r\nsoftest, deepest, most weather-fretted hue, rising from a broad, still\r\nmoat, it affected the young visitor as a castle in a legend. The day was\r\ncool and rather lustreless; the first note of autumn had been struck,\r\nand the watery sunshine rested on the walls in blurred and desultory\r\ngleams, washing them, as it were, in places tenderly chosen, where the\r\nache of antiquity was keenest. Her host\'s brother, the Vicar, had come\r\nto luncheon, and Isabel had had five minutes\' talk with him--time enough\r\nto institute a search for a rich ecclesiasticism and give it up as\r\nvain. The marks of the Vicar of Lockleigh were a big, athletic figure,\r\na candid, natural countenance, a capacious appetite and a tendency to\r\nindiscriminate laughter. Isabel learned afterwards from her cousin\r\nthat before taking orders he had been a mighty wrestler and that he\r\nwas still, on occasion--in the privacy of the family circle as it\r\nwere--quite capable of flooring his man. Isabel liked him--she was in\r\nthe mood for liking everything; but her imagination was a good deal\r\ntaxed to think of him as a source of spiritual aid. The whole party, on\r\nleaving lunch, went to walk in the grounds; but Lord Warburton exercised\r\nsome ingenuity in engaging his least familiar guest in a stroll apart\r\nfrom the others.\r\n\r\n"I wish you to see the place properly, seriously," he said. "You can\'t\r\ndo so if your attention is distracted by irrelevant gossip." His own\r\nconversation (though he told Isabel a good deal about the house, which\r\nhad a very curious history) was not purely archaeological; he reverted\r\nat intervals to matters more personal--matters personal to the young\r\nlady as well as to himself. But at last, after a pause of some duration,\r\nreturning for a moment to their ostensible theme, "Ah, well," he said,\r\n"I\'m very glad indeed you like the old barrack. I wish you could see\r\nmore of it--that you could stay here a while. My sisters have taken an\r\nimmense fancy to you--if that would be any inducement."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no want of inducements," Isabel answered; "but I\'m afraid I\r\ncan\'t make engagements. I\'m quite in my aunt\'s hands."\r\n\r\n"Ah, pardon me if I say I don\'t exactly believe that. I\'m pretty sure\r\nyou can do whatever you want."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry if I make that impression on you; I don\'t think it\'s a nice\r\nimpression to make."\r\n\r\n"It has the merit of permitting me to hope." And Lord Warburton paused a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n"To hope what?"\r\n\r\n"That in future I may see you often."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Isabel, "to enjoy that pleasure I needn\'t be so terribly\r\nemancipated."\r\n\r\n"Doubtless not; and yet, at the same time, I don\'t think your uncle\r\nlikes me."\r\n\r\n"You\'re very much mistaken. I\'ve heard him speak very highly of you."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad you have talked about me," said Lord Warburton. "But, I\r\nnevertheless don\'t think he\'d like me to keep coming to Gardencourt."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t answer for my uncle\'s tastes," the girl rejoined, "though I\r\nought as far as possible to take them into account. But for myself I\r\nshall be very glad to see you."\r\n\r\n"Now that\'s what I like to hear you say. I\'m charmed when you say that."\r\n\r\n"You\'re easily charmed, my lord," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not easily charmed!" And then he stopped a moment. "But you\'ve\r\ncharmed me, Miss Archer."\r\n\r\nThese words were uttered with an indefinable sound which startled the\r\ngirl; it struck her as the prelude to something grave: she had heard the\r\nsound before and she recognised it. She had no wish, however, that for\r\nthe moment such a prelude should have a sequel, and she said as gaily\r\nas possible and as quickly as an appreciable degree of agitation would\r\nallow her: "I\'m afraid there\'s no prospect of my being able to come here\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"Never?" said Lord Warburton.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t say \'never\'; I should feel very melodramatic."\r\n\r\n"May I come and see you then some day next week?"\r\n\r\n"Most assuredly. What is there to prevent it?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing tangible. But with you I never feel safe. I\'ve a sort of sense\r\nthat you\'re always summing people up."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t of necessity lose by that."\r\n\r\n"It\'s very kind of you to say so; but, even if I gain, stern justice is\r\nnot what I most love. Is Mrs. Touchett going to take you abroad?"\r\n\r\n"I hope so."\r\n\r\n"Is England not good enough for you?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s a very Machiavellian speech; it doesn\'t deserve an answer. I\r\nwant to see as many countries as I can."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ll go on judging, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Enjoying, I hope, too."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s what you enjoy most; I can\'t make out what you\'re up to,"\r\nsaid Lord Warburton. "You strike me as having mysterious purposes--vast\r\ndesigns."\r\n\r\n"You\'re so good as to have a theory about me which I don\'t at all fill\r\nout. Is there anything mysterious in a purpose entertained and\r\nexecuted every year, in the most public manner, by fifty thousand of\r\nmy fellow-countrymen--the purpose of improving one\'s mind by foreign\r\ntravel?"\r\n\r\n"You can\'t improve your mind, Miss Archer," her companion declared.\r\n"It\'s already a most formidable instrument. It looks down on us all; it\r\ndespises us."\r\n\r\n"Despises you? You\'re making fun of me," said Isabel seriously.\r\n\r\n"Well, you think us \'quaint\'--that\'s the same thing. I won\'t be thought\r\n\'quaint,\' to begin with; I\'m not so in the least. I protest."\r\n\r\n"That protest is one of the quaintest things I\'ve ever heard," Isabel\r\nanswered with a smile.\r\n\r\nLord Warburton was briefly silent. "You judge only from the outside--you\r\ndon\'t care," he said presently. "You only care to amuse yourself." The\r\nnote she had heard in his voice a moment before reappeared, and mixed\r\nwith it now was an audible strain of bitterness--a bitterness so abrupt\r\nand inconsequent that the girl was afraid she had hurt him. She had\r\noften heard that the English are a highly eccentric people, and she\r\nhad even read in some ingenious author that they are at bottom the most\r\nromantic of races. Was Lord Warburton suddenly turning romantic--was he\r\ngoing to make her a scene, in his own house, only the third time they\r\nhad met? She was reassured quickly enough by her sense of his great good\r\nmanners, which was not impaired by the fact that he had already touched\r\nthe furthest limit of good taste in expressing his admiration of a young\r\nlady who had confided in his hospitality. She was right in trusting\r\nto his good manners, for he presently went on, laughing a little and\r\nwithout a trace of the accent that had discomposed her: "I don\'t mean of\r\ncourse that you amuse yourself with trifles. You select great materials;\r\nthe foibles, the afflictions of human nature, the peculiarities of\r\nnations!"\r\n\r\n"As regards that," said Isabel, "I should find in my own nation\r\nentertainment for a lifetime. But we\'ve a long drive, and my aunt\r\nwill soon wish to start." She turned back toward the others and Lord\r\nWarburton walked beside her in silence. But before they reached the\r\nothers, "I shall come and see you next week," he said.\r\n\r\nShe had received an appreciable shock, but as it died away she felt that\r\nshe couldn\'t pretend to herself that it was altogether a painful one.\r\nNevertheless she made answer to his declaration, coldly enough, "Just as\r\nyou please." And her coldness was not the calculation of her effect--a\r\ngame she played in a much smaller degree than would have seemed probable\r\nto many critics. It came from a certain fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nThe day after her visit to Lockleigh she received a note from her friend\r\nMiss Stackpole--a note of which the envelope, exhibiting in conjunction\r\nthe postmark of Liverpool and the neat calligraphy of the quick-fingered\r\nHenrietta, caused her some liveliness of emotion. "Here I am, my lovely\r\nfriend," Miss Stackpole wrote; "I managed to get off at last. I decided\r\nonly the night before I left New York--the _Interviewer_ having come round\r\nto my figure. I put a few things into a bag, like a veteran journalist,\r\nand came down to the steamer in a street-car. Where are you and where\r\ncan we meet? I suppose you\'re visiting at some castle or other and have\r\nalready acquired the correct accent. Perhaps even you have married a\r\nlord; I almost hope you have, for I want some introductions to the first\r\npeople and shall count on you for a few. The _Interviewer_ wants some\r\nlight on the nobility. My first impressions (of the people at large) are\r\nnot rose-coloured; but I wish to talk them over with you, and you know\r\nthat, whatever I am, at least I\'m not superficial. I\'ve also something\r\nvery particular to tell you. Do appoint a meeting as quickly as you can;\r\ncome to London (I should like so much to visit the sights with you) or\r\nelse let me come to you, wherever you are. I will do so with pleasure;\r\nfor you know everything interests me and I wish to see as much as\r\npossible of the inner life."\r\n\r\nIsabel judged best not to show this letter to her uncle; but she\r\nacquainted him with its purport, and, as she expected, he begged her\r\ninstantly to assure Miss Stackpole, in his name, that he should be\r\ndelighted to receive her at Gardencourt. "Though she\'s a literary lady,"\r\nhe said, "I suppose that, being an American, she won\'t show me up, as\r\nthat other one did. She has seen others like me."\r\n\r\n"She has seen no other so delightful!" Isabel answered; but she was\r\nnot altogether at ease about Henrietta\'s reproductive instincts, which\r\nbelonged to that side of her friend\'s character which she regarded with\r\nleast complacency. She wrote to Miss Stackpole, however, that she would\r\nbe very welcome under Mr. Touchett\'s roof; and this alert young woman\r\nlost no time in announcing her prompt approach. She had gone up to\r\nLondon, and it was from that centre that she took the train for the\r\nstation nearest to Gardencourt, where Isabel and Ralph were in waiting\r\nto receive her.\r\n\r\n"Shall I love her or shall I hate her?" Ralph asked while they moved\r\nalong the platform.\r\n\r\n"Whichever you do will matter very little to her," said Isabel. "She\r\ndoesn\'t care a straw what men think of her."\r\n\r\n"As a man I\'m bound to dislike her then. She must be a kind of monster.\r\nIs she very ugly?"\r\n\r\n"No, she\'s decidedly pretty."\r\n\r\n"A female interviewer--a reporter in petticoats? I\'m very curious to see\r\nher," Ralph conceded.\r\n\r\n"It\'s very easy to laugh at her but it is not easy to be as brave as\r\nshe."\r\n\r\n"I should think not; crimes of violence and attacks on the person\r\nrequire more or less pluck. Do you suppose she\'ll interview me?"\r\n\r\n"Never in the world. She\'ll not think you of enough importance."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll see," said Ralph. "She\'ll send a description of us all,\r\nincluding Bunchie, to her newspaper."\r\n\r\n"I shall ask her not to," Isabel answered.\r\n\r\n"You think she\'s capable of it then?"\r\n\r\n"Perfectly."\r\n\r\n"And yet you\'ve made her your bosom-friend?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve not made her my bosom-friend; but I like her in spite of her\r\nfaults."\r\n\r\n"Ah well," said Ralph, "I\'m afraid I shall dislike her in spite of her\r\nmerits."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll probably fall in love with her at the end of three days."\r\n\r\n"And have my love-letters published in the _Interviewer_? Never!" cried\r\nthe young man.\r\n\r\nThe train presently arrived, and Miss Stackpole, promptly descending,\r\nproved, as Isabel had promised, quite delicately, even though rather\r\nprovincially, fair. She was a neat, plump person, of medium stature,\r\nwith a round face, a small mouth, a delicate complexion, a bunch of\r\nlight brown ringlets at the back of her head and a peculiarly open,\r\nsurprised-looking eye. The most striking point in her appearance was the\r\nremarkable fixedness of this organ, which rested without impudence or\r\ndefiance, but as if in conscientious exercise of a natural right, upon\r\nevery object it happened to encounter. It rested in this manner upon\r\nRalph himself, a little arrested by Miss Stackpole\'s gracious and\r\ncomfortable aspect, which hinted that it wouldn\'t be so easy as he had\r\nassumed to disapprove of her. She rustled, she shimmered, in fresh,\r\ndove-coloured draperies, and Ralph saw at a glance that she was as crisp\r\nand new and comprehensive as a first issue before the folding. From top\r\nto toe she had probably no misprint. She spoke in a clear, high voice--a\r\nvoice not rich but loud; yet after she had taken her place with her\r\ncompanions in Mr. Touchett\'s carriage she struck him as not all in the\r\nlarge type, the type of horrid "headings," that he had expected. She\r\nanswered the enquiries made of her by Isabel, however, and in which the\r\nyoung man ventured to join, with copious lucidity; and later, in the\r\nlibrary at Gardencourt, when she had made the acquaintance of Mr.\r\nTouchett (his wife not having thought it necessary to appear) did more\r\nto give the measure of her confidence in her powers.\r\n\r\n"Well, I should like to know whether you consider yourselves American\r\nor English," she broke out. "If once I knew I could talk to you\r\naccordingly."\r\n\r\n"Talk to us anyhow and we shall be thankful," Ralph liberally answered.\r\n\r\nShe fixed her eyes on him, and there was something in their character\r\nthat reminded him of large polished buttons--buttons that might have\r\nfixed the elastic loops of some tense receptacle: he seemed to see the\r\nreflection of surrounding objects on the pupil. The expression of a\r\nbutton is not usually deemed human, but there was something in Miss\r\nStackpole\'s gaze that made him, as a very modest man, feel vaguely\r\nembarrassed--less inviolate, more dishonoured, than he liked. This\r\nsensation, it must be added, after he had spent a day or two in her\r\ncompany, sensibly diminished, though it never wholly lapsed. "I don\'t\r\nsuppose that you\'re going to undertake to persuade me that you\'re an\r\nAmerican," she said.\r\n\r\n"To please you I\'ll be an Englishman, I\'ll be a Turk!"\r\n\r\n"Well, if you can change about that way you\'re very welcome," Miss\r\nStackpole returned.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure you understand everything and that differences of nationality\r\nare no barrier to you," Ralph went on.\r\n\r\nMiss Stackpole gazed at him still. "Do you mean the foreign languages?"\r\n\r\n"The languages are nothing. I mean the spirit--the genius."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not sure that I understand you," said the correspondent of the\r\n_Interviewer_; "but I expect I shall before I leave."\r\n\r\n"He\'s what\'s called a cosmopolite," Isabel suggested.\r\n\r\n"That means he\'s a little of everything and not much of any. I must say\r\nI think patriotism is like charity--it begins at home."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but where does home begin, Miss Stackpole?" Ralph enquired.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know where it begins, but I know where it ends. It ended a long\r\ntime before I got here."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you like it over here?" asked Mr. Touchett with his aged,\r\ninnocent voice.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, I haven\'t quite made up my mind what ground I shall take.\r\nI feel a good deal cramped. I felt it on the journey from Liverpool to\r\nLondon."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you were in a crowded carriage," Ralph suggested.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but it was crowded with friends--party of Americans whose\r\nacquaintance I had made upon the steamer; a lovely group from Little\r\nRock, Arkansas. In spite of that I felt cramped--I felt something\r\npressing upon me; I couldn\'t tell what it was. I felt at the very\r\ncommencement as if I were not going to accord with the atmosphere. But\r\nI suppose I shall make my own atmosphere. That\'s the true way--then you\r\ncan breathe. Your surroundings seem very attractive."\r\n\r\n"Ah, we too are a lovely group!" said Ralph. "Wait a little and you\'ll\r\nsee."\r\n\r\nMiss Stackpole showed every disposition to wait and evidently was\r\nprepared to make a considerable stay at Gardencourt. She occupied\r\nherself in the mornings with literary labour; but in spite of this\r\nIsabel spent many hours with her friend, who, once her daily task\r\nperformed, deprecated, in fact defied, isolation. Isabel speedily found\r\noccasion to desire her to desist from celebrating the charms of their\r\ncommon sojourn in print, having discovered, on the second morning\r\nof Miss Stackpole\'s visit, that she was engaged on a letter to the\r\n_Interviewer_, of which the title, in her exquisitely neat and legible\r\nhand (exactly that of the copybooks which our heroine remembered at\r\nschool) was "Americans and Tudors--Glimpses of Gardencourt." Miss\r\nStackpole, with the best conscience in the world, offered to read her\r\nletter to Isabel, who immediately put in her protest.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you ought to do that. I don\'t think you ought to describe\r\nthe place."\r\n\r\nHenrietta gazed at her as usual. "Why, it\'s just what the people want,\r\nand it\'s a lovely place."\r\n\r\n"It\'s too lovely to be put in the newspapers, and it\'s not what my uncle\r\nwants."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you believe that!" cried Henrietta. "They\'re always delighted\r\nafterwards."\r\n\r\n"My uncle won\'t be delighted--nor my cousin either. They\'ll consider it\r\na breach of hospitality."\r\n\r\nMiss Stackpole showed no sense of confusion; she simply wiped her pen,\r\nvery neatly, upon an elegant little implement which she kept for the\r\npurpose, and put away her manuscript. "Of course if you don\'t approve I\r\nwon\'t do it; but I sacrifice a beautiful subject."\r\n\r\n"There are plenty of other subjects, there are subjects all round you.\r\nWe\'ll take some drives; I\'ll show you some charming scenery."\r\n\r\n"Scenery\'s not my department; I always need a human interest. You know\r\nI\'m deeply human, Isabel; I always was," Miss Stackpole rejoined. "I was\r\ngoing to bring in your cousin--the alienated American. There\'s a\r\ngreat demand just now for the alienated American, and your cousin\'s a\r\nbeautiful specimen. I should have handled him severely."\r\n\r\n"He would have died of it!" Isabel exclaimed. "Not of the severity, but\r\nof the publicity."\r\n\r\n"Well, I should have liked to kill him a little. And I should have\r\ndelighted to do your uncle, who seems to me a much nobler type--the\r\nAmerican faithful still. He\'s a grand old man; I don\'t see how he can\r\nobject to my paying him honour."\r\n\r\nIsabel looked at her companion in much wonderment; it struck her as\r\nstrange that a nature in which she found so much to esteem should break\r\ndown so in spots. "My poor Henrietta," she said, "you\'ve no sense of\r\nprivacy."\r\n\r\nHenrietta coloured deeply, and for a moment her brilliant eyes were\r\nsuffused, while Isabel found her more than ever inconsequent. "You do me\r\ngreat injustice," said Miss Stackpole with dignity. "I\'ve never written\r\na word about myself!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m very sure of that; but it seems to me one should be modest for\r\nothers also!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s very good!" cried Henrietta, seizing her pen again. "Just\r\nlet me make a note of it and I\'ll put it in somewhere." she was a\r\nthoroughly good-natured woman, and half an hour later she was in as\r\ncheerful a mood as should have been looked for in a newspaper-lady\r\nin want of matter. "I\'ve promised to do the social side," she said to\r\nIsabel; "and how can I do it unless I get ideas? If I can\'t describe\r\nthis place don\'t you know some place I can describe?" Isabel promised\r\nshe would bethink herself, and the next day, in conversation with her\r\nfriend, she happened to mention her visit to Lord Warburton\'s ancient\r\nhouse. "Ah, you must take me there--that\'s just the place for me!" Miss\r\nStackpole cried. "I must get a glimpse of the nobility."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t take you," said Isabel; "but Lord Warburton\'s coming here, and\r\nyou\'ll have a chance to see him and observe him. Only if you intend to\r\nrepeat his conversation I shall certainly give him warning."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t do that," her companion pleaded; "I want him to be natural."\r\n\r\n"An Englishman\'s never so natural as when he\'s holding his tongue,"\r\nIsabel declared.\r\n\r\nIt was not apparent, at the end of three days, that her cousin had,\r\naccording to her prophecy, lost his heart to their visitor, though he\r\nhad spent a good deal of time in her society. They strolled about the\r\npark together and sat under the trees, and in the afternoon, when it was\r\ndelightful to float along the Thames, Miss Stackpole occupied a place\r\nin the boat in which hitherto Ralph had had but a single companion. Her\r\npresence proved somehow less irreducible to soft particles than Ralph\r\nhad expected in the natural perturbation of his sense of the perfect\r\nsolubility of that of his cousin; for the correspondent of the\r\n_Interviewer_ prompted mirth in him, and he had long since decided that\r\nthe crescendo of mirth should be the flower of his declining days.\r\nHenrietta, on her side, failed a little to justify Isabel\'s declaration\r\nwith regard to her indifference to masculine opinion; for poor Ralph\r\nappeared to have presented himself to her as an irritating problem,\r\nwhich it would be almost immoral not to work out.\r\n\r\n"What does he do for a living?" she asked of Isabel the evening of her\r\narrival. "Does he go round all day with his hands in his pockets?"\r\n\r\n"He does nothing," smiled Isabel; "he\'s a gentleman of large leisure."\r\n\r\n"Well, I call that a shame--when I have to work like a car-conductor,"\r\nMiss Stackpole replied. "I should like to show him up."\r\n\r\n"He\'s in wretched health; he\'s quite unfit for work," Isabel urged.\r\n\r\n"Pshaw! don\'t you believe it. I work when I\'m sick," cried her friend.\r\nLater, when she stepped into the boat on joining the water-party, she\r\nremarked to Ralph that she supposed he hated her and would like to drown\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Ah no," said Ralph, "I keep my victims for a slower torture. And you\'d\r\nbe such an interesting one!"\r\n\r\n"Well, you do torture me; I may say that. But I shock all your\r\nprejudices; that\'s one comfort."\r\n\r\n"My prejudices? I haven\'t a prejudice to bless myself with. There\'s\r\nintellectual poverty for you."\r\n\r\n"The more shame to you; I\'ve some delicious ones. Of course I spoil your\r\nflirtation, or whatever it is you call it, with your cousin; but I don\'t\r\ncare for that, as I render her the service of drawing you out. She\'ll\r\nsee how thin you are."\r\n\r\n"Ah, do draw me out!" Ralph exclaimed. "So few people will take the\r\ntrouble."\r\n\r\nMiss Stackpole, in this undertaking, appeared to shrink from no effort;\r\nresorting largely, whenever the opportunity offered, to the natural\r\nexpedient of interrogation. On the following day the weather was\r\nbad, and in the afternoon the young man, by way of providing indoor\r\namusement, offered to show her the pictures. Henrietta strolled through\r\nthe long gallery in his society, while he pointed out its principal\r\nornaments and mentioned the painters and subjects. Miss Stackpole looked\r\nat the pictures in perfect silence, committing herself to no opinion,\r\nand Ralph was gratified by the fact that she delivered herself of none\r\nof the little ready-made ejaculations of delight of which the visitors\r\nto Gardencourt were so frequently lavish. This young lady indeed, to do\r\nher justice, was but little addicted to the use of conventional terms;\r\nthere was something earnest and inventive in her tone, which at times,\r\nin its strained deliberation, suggested a person of high culture\r\nspeaking a foreign language. Ralph Touchett subsequently learned that\r\nshe had at one time officiated as art critic to a journal of the other\r\nworld; but she appeared, in spite of this fact, to carry in her pocket\r\nnone of the small change of admiration. Suddenly, just after he had\r\ncalled her attention to a charming Constable, she turned and looked at\r\nhim as if he himself had been a picture.\r\n\r\n"Do you always spend your time like this?" she demanded.\r\n\r\n"I seldom spend it so agreeably."\r\n\r\n"Well, you know what I mean--without any regular occupation."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Ralph, "I\'m the idlest man living."\r\n\r\nMiss Stackpole directed her gaze to the Constable again, and Ralph\r\nbespoke her attention for a small Lancret hanging near it, which\r\nrepresented a gentleman in a pink doublet and hose and a ruff, leaning\r\nagainst the pedestal of the statue of a nymph in a garden and playing\r\nthe guitar to two ladies seated on the grass. "That\'s my ideal of a\r\nregular occupation," he said.\r\n\r\nMiss Stackpole turned to him again, and, though her eyes had rested\r\nupon the picture, he saw she had missed the subject. She was thinking\r\nof something much more serious. "I don\'t see how you can reconcile it to\r\nyour conscience."\r\n\r\n"My dear lady, I have no conscience!"\r\n\r\n"Well, I advise you to cultivate one. You\'ll need it the next time you\r\ngo to America."\r\n\r\n"I shall probably never go again."\r\n\r\n"Are you ashamed to show yourself?"\r\n\r\nRalph meditated with a mild smile. "I suppose that if one has no\r\nconscience one has no shame."\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'ve got plenty of assurance," Henrietta declared. "Do you\r\nconsider it right to give up your country?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, one doesn\'t give up one\'s country any more than one gives _up_\r\none\'s grandmother. They\'re both antecedent to choice--elements of one\'s\r\ncomposition that are not to be eliminated."\r\n\r\n"I suppose that means that you\'ve tried and been worsted. What do they\r\nthink of you over here?"\r\n\r\n"They delight in me."\r\n\r\n"That\'s because you truckle to them."\r\n\r\n"Ah, set it down a little to my natural charm!" Ralph sighed.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything about your natural charm. If you\'ve got any charm\r\nit\'s quite unnatural. It\'s wholly acquired--or at least you\'ve tried\r\nhard to acquire it, living over here. I don\'t say you\'ve succeeded. It\'s\r\na charm that I don\'t appreciate, anyway. Make yourself useful in some\r\nway, and then we\'ll talk about it." "Well, now, tell me what I shall\r\ndo," said Ralph.\r\n\r\n"Go right home, to begin with."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I see. And then?"\r\n\r\n"Take right hold of something."\r\n\r\n"Well, now, what sort of thing?"\r\n\r\n"Anything you please, so long as you take hold. Some new idea, some big\r\nwork."\r\n\r\n"Is it very difficult to take hold?" Ralph enquired.\r\n\r\n"Not if you put your heart into it."\r\n\r\n"Ah, my heart," said Ralph. "If it depends upon my heart--!"\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you got a heart?"\r\n\r\n"I had one a few days ago, but I\'ve lost it since."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not serious," Miss Stackpole remarked; "that\'s what\'s the matter\r\nwith you." But for all this, in a day or two, she again permitted him to\r\nfix her attention and on the later occasion assigned a different cause\r\nto her mysterious perversity. "I know what\'s the matter with you, Mr.\r\nTouchett," she said. "You think you\'re too good to get married."\r\n\r\n"I thought so till I knew you, Miss Stackpole," Ralph answered; "and\r\nthen I suddenly changed my mind."\r\n\r\n"Oh pshaw!" Henrietta groaned.\r\n\r\n"Then it seemed to me," said Ralph, "that I was not good enough."\r\n\r\n"It would improve you. Besides, it\'s your duty."\r\n\r\n"Ah," cried the young man, "one has so many duties! Is that a duty too?"\r\n\r\n"Of course it is--did you never know that before? It\'s every one\'s duty\r\nto get married."\r\n\r\nRalph meditated a moment; he was disappointed. There was something in\r\nMiss Stackpole he had begun to like; it seemed to him that if she\r\nwas not a charming woman she was at least a very good "sort." She was\r\nwanting in distinction, but, as Isabel had said, she was brave: she went\r\ninto cages, she flourished lashes, like a spangled lion-tamer. He had\r\nnot supposed her to be capable of vulgar arts, but these last words\r\nstruck him as a false note. When a marriageable young woman urges\r\nmatrimony on an unencumbered young man the most obvious explanation of\r\nher conduct is not the altruistic impulse.\r\n\r\n"Ah, well now, there\'s a good deal to be said about that," Ralph\r\nrejoined.\r\n\r\n"There may be, but that\'s the principal thing. I must say I think it\r\nlooks very exclusive, going round all alone, as if you thought no woman\r\nwas good enough for you. Do you think you\'re better than any one else in\r\nthe world? In America it\'s usual for people to marry."\r\n\r\n"If it\'s my duty," Ralph asked, "is it not, by analogy, yours as well?"\r\n\r\nMiss Stackpole\'s ocular surfaces unwinkingly caught the sun. "Have you\r\nthe fond hope of finding a flaw in my reasoning? Of course I\'ve as good\r\na right to marry as any one else."\r\n\r\n"Well then," said Ralph, "I won\'t say it vexes me to see you single. It\r\ndelights me rather."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not serious yet. You never will be."\r\n\r\n"Shall you not believe me to be so on the day I tell you I desire to\r\ngive up the practice of going round alone?"\r\n\r\nMiss Stackpole looked at him for a moment in a manner which seemed to\r\nannounce a reply that might technically be called encouraging. But to\r\nhis great surprise this expression suddenly resolved itself into an\r\nappearance of alarm and even of resentment. "No, not even then," she\r\nanswered dryly. After which she walked away.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve not conceived a passion for your friend," Ralph said that evening\r\nto Isabel, "though we talked some time this morning about it."\r\n\r\n"And you said something she didn\'t like," the girl replied.\r\n\r\nRalph stared. "Has she complained of me?"\r\n\r\n"She told me she thinks there\'s something very low in the tone of\r\nEuropeans towards women."\r\n\r\n"Does she call me a European?"\r\n\r\n"One of the worst. She told me you had said to her something that an\r\nAmerican never would have said. But she didn\'t repeat it."\r\n\r\nRalph treated himself to a luxury of laughter. "She\'s an extraordinary\r\ncombination. Did she think I was making love to her?"\r\n\r\n"No; I believe even Americans do that. But she apparently thought you\r\nmistook the intention of something she had said, and put an unkind\r\nconstruction on it."\r\n\r\n"I thought she was proposing marriage to me and I accepted her. Was that\r\nunkind?"\r\n\r\nIsabel smiled. "It was unkind to me. I don\'t want you to marry."\r\n\r\n"My dear cousin, what\'s one to do among you all?" Ralph demanded. "Miss\r\nStackpole tells me it\'s my bounden duty, and that it\'s hers, in general,\r\nto see I do mine!"\r\n\r\n"She has a great sense of duty," said Isabel gravely. "She has indeed,\r\nand it\'s the motive of everything she says. That\'s what I like her for.\r\nShe thinks it\'s unworthy of you to keep so many things to yourself.\r\nThat\'s what she wanted to express. If you thought she was trying to--to\r\nattract you, you were very wrong."\r\n\r\n"It\'s true it was an odd way, but I did think she was trying to attract\r\nme. Forgive my depravity."\r\n\r\n"You\'re very conceited. She had no interested views, and never supposed\r\nyou would think she had."\r\n\r\n"One must be very modest then to talk with such women," Ralph said\r\nhumbly. "But it\'s a very strange type. She\'s too personal--considering\r\nthat she expects other people not to be. She walks in without knocking\r\nat the door."\r\n\r\n"Yes," Isabel admitted, "she doesn\'t sufficiently recognise the\r\nexistence of knockers; and indeed I\'m not sure that she doesn\'t think\r\nthem rather a pretentious ornament. She thinks one\'s door should stand\r\najar. But I persist in liking her."\r\n\r\n"I persist in thinking her too familiar," Ralph rejoined, naturally\r\nsomewhat uncomfortable under the sense of having been doubly deceived in\r\nMiss Stackpole.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Isabel, smiling, "I\'m afraid it\'s because she\'s rather\r\nvulgar that I like her."\r\n\r\n"She would be flattered by your reason!"\r\n\r\n"If I should tell her I wouldn\'t express it in that way. I should say\r\nit\'s because there\'s something of the \'people\' in her."\r\n\r\n"What do you know about the people? and what does she, for that matter?"\r\n\r\n"She knows a great deal, and I know enough to feel that she\'s a kind\r\nof emanation of the great democracy--of the continent, the country, the\r\nnation. I don\'t say that she sums it all up, that would be too much to\r\nask of her. But she suggests it; she vividly figures it."\r\n\r\n"You like her then for patriotic reasons. I\'m afraid it is on those very\r\ngrounds I object to her."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Isabel with a kind of joyous sigh, "I like so many things! If\r\na thing strikes me with a certain intensity I accept it. I don\'t want to\r\nswagger, but I suppose I\'m rather versatile. I like people to be totally\r\ndifferent from Henrietta--in the style of Lord Warburton\'s sisters for\r\ninstance. So long as I look at the Misses Molyneux they seem to me\r\nto answer a kind of ideal. Then Henrietta presents herself, and I\'m\r\nstraightway convinced by her; not so much in respect to herself as in\r\nrespect to what masses behind her."\r\n\r\n"Ah, you mean the back view of her," Ralph suggested.\r\n\r\n"What she says is true," his cousin answered; "you\'ll never be serious.\r\nI like the great country stretching away beyond the rivers and across\r\nthe prairies, blooming and smiling and spreading till it stops at the\r\ngreen Pacific! A strong, sweet, fresh odour seems to rise from it,\r\nand Henrietta--pardon my simile--has something of that odour in her\r\ngarments."\r\n\r\nIsabel blushed a little as she concluded this speech, and the blush,\r\ntogether with the momentary ardour she had thrown into it, was so\r\nbecoming to her that Ralph stood smiling at her for a moment after she\r\nhad ceased speaking. "I\'m not sure the Pacific\'s so green as that," he\r\nsaid; "but you\'re a young woman of imagination. Henrietta, however, does\r\nsmell of the Future--it almost knocks one down!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nHe took a resolve after this not to misinterpret her words even when\r\nMiss Stackpole appeared to strike the personal note most strongly. He\r\nbethought himself that persons, in her view, were simple and homogeneous\r\norganisms, and that he, for his own part, was too perverted a\r\nrepresentative of the nature of man to have a right to deal with her\r\nin strict reciprocity. He carried out his resolve with a great deal of\r\ntact, and the young lady found in renewed contact with him no obstacle\r\nto the exercise of her genius for unshrinking enquiry, the general\r\napplication of her confidence. Her situation at Gardencourt therefore,\r\nappreciated as we have seen her to be by Isabel and full of appreciation\r\nherself of that free play of intelligence which, to her sense, rendered\r\nIsabel\'s character a sister-spirit, and of the easy venerableness of Mr.\r\nTouchett, whose noble tone, as she said, met with her full approval--her\r\nsituation at Gardencourt would have been perfectly comfortable had she\r\nnot conceived an irresistible mistrust of the little lady for whom she\r\nhad at first supposed herself obliged to "allow" as mistress of the\r\nhouse. She presently discovered, in truth, that this obligation was of\r\nthe lightest and that Mrs. Touchett cared very little how Miss Stackpole\r\nbehaved. Mrs. Touchett had defined her to Isabel as both an adventuress\r\nand a bore--adventuresses usually giving one more of a thrill; she had\r\nexpressed some surprise at her niece\'s having selected such a friend,\r\nyet had immediately added that she knew Isabel\'s friends were her own\r\naffair and that she had never undertaken to like them all or to restrict\r\nthe girl to those she liked.\r\n\r\n"If you could see none but the people I like, my dear, you\'d have a very\r\nsmall society," Mrs. Touchett frankly admitted; "and I don\'t think I\r\nlike any man or woman well enough to recommend them to you. When\r\nit comes to recommending it\'s a serious affair. I don\'t like Miss\r\nStackpole--everything about her displeases me; she talks so much\r\ntoo loud and looks at one as if one wanted to look at her--which one\r\ndoesn\'t. I\'m sure she has lived all her life in a boarding-house, and I\r\ndetest the manners and the liberties of such places. If you ask me if I\r\nprefer my own manners, which you doubtless think very bad, I\'ll tell\r\nyou that I prefer them immensely. Miss Stackpole knows I detest\r\nboarding-house civilisation, and she detests me for detesting it,\r\nbecause she thinks it the highest in the world. She\'d like Gardencourt a\r\ngreat deal better if it were a boarding-house. For me, I find it almost\r\ntoo much of one! We shall never get on together therefore, and there\'s\r\nno use trying."\r\n\r\nMrs. Touchett was right in guessing that Henrietta disapproved of her,\r\nbut she had not quite put her finger on the reason. A day or two after\r\nMiss Stackpole\'s arrival she had made some invidious reflexions on\r\nAmerican hotels, which excited a vein of counter-argument on the part\r\nof the correspondent of the _Interviewer_, who in the exercise of her\r\nprofession had acquainted herself, in the western world, with every form\r\nof caravansary. Henrietta expressed the opinion that American hotels\r\nwere the best in the world, and Mrs. Touchett, fresh from a renewed\r\nstruggle with them, recorded a conviction that they were the worst.\r\nRalph, with his experimental geniality, suggested, by way of healing\r\nthe breach, that the truth lay between the two extremes and that the\r\nestablishments in question ought to be described as fair middling. This\r\ncontribution to the discussion, however, Miss Stackpole rejected with\r\nscorn. Middling indeed! If they were not the best in the world they were\r\nthe worst, but there was nothing middling about an American hotel.\r\n\r\n"We judge from different points of view, evidently," said Mrs. Touchett.\r\n"I like to be treated as an individual; you like to be treated as a\r\n\'party.\'"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you mean," Henrietta replied. "I like to be treated\r\nas an American lady."\r\n\r\n"Poor American ladies!" cried Mrs. Touchett with a laugh. "They\'re the\r\nslaves of slaves."\r\n\r\n"They\'re the companions of freemen," Henrietta retorted.\r\n\r\n"They\'re the companions of their servants--the Irish chambermaid and the\r\nnegro waiter. They share their work."\r\n\r\n"Do you call the domestics in an American household \'slaves\'?" Miss\r\nStackpole enquired. "If that\'s the way you desire to treat them, no\r\nwonder you don\'t like America."\r\n\r\n"If you\'ve not good servants you\'re miserable," Mrs. Touchett serenely\r\nsaid. "They\'re very bad in America, but I\'ve five perfect ones in\r\nFlorence."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see what you want with five," Henrietta couldn\'t help\r\nobserving. "I don\'t think I should like to see five persons surrounding\r\nme in that menial position."\r\n\r\n"I like them in that position better than in some others," proclaimed\r\nMrs. Touchett with much meaning.\r\n\r\n"Should you like me better if I were your butler, dear?" her husband\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I should: you wouldn\'t at all have the _tenue_."\r\n\r\n"The companions of freemen--I like that, Miss Stackpole," said Ralph.\r\n"It\'s a beautiful description."\r\n\r\n"When I said freemen I didn\'t mean you, sir!"\r\n\r\nAnd this was the only reward that Ralph got for his compliment. Miss\r\nStackpole was baffled; she evidently thought there was something\r\ntreasonable in Mrs. Touchett\'s appreciation of a class which she\r\nprivately judged to be a mysterious survival of feudalism. It was\r\nperhaps because her mind was oppressed with this image that she suffered\r\nsome days to elapse before she took occasion to say to Isabel: "My dear\r\nfriend, I wonder if you\'re growing faithless."\r\n\r\n"Faithless? Faithless to you, Henrietta?"\r\n\r\n"No, that would be a great pain; but it\'s not that."\r\n\r\n"Faithless to my country then?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, that I hope will never be. When I wrote to you from Liverpool I\r\nsaid I had something particular to tell you. You\'ve never asked me what\r\nit is. Is it because you\'ve suspected?"\r\n\r\n"Suspected what? As a rule I don\'t think I suspect," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"I remember now that phrase in your letter, but I confess I had\r\nforgotten it. What have you to tell me?"\r\n\r\nHenrietta looked disappointed, and her steady gaze betrayed it.\r\n"You don\'t ask that right--as if you thought it important. You\'re\r\nchanged--you\'re thinking of other things."\r\n\r\n"Tell me what you mean, and I\'ll think of that."\r\n\r\n"Will you really think of it? That\'s what I wish to be sure of."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve not much control of my thoughts, but I\'ll do my best," said\r\nIsabel. Henrietta gazed at her, in silence, for a period which tried\r\nIsabel\'s patience, so that our heroine added at last: "Do you mean that\r\nyou\'re going to be married?"\r\n\r\n"Not till I\'ve seen Europe!" said Miss Stackpole. "What are you laughing\r\nat?" she went on. "What I mean is that Mr. Goodwood came out in the\r\nsteamer with me."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" Isabel responded.\r\n\r\n"You say that right. I had a good deal of talk with him; he has come\r\nafter you."\r\n\r\n"Did he tell you so?"\r\n\r\n"No, he told me nothing; that\'s how I knew it," said Henrietta cleverly.\r\n"He said very little about you, but I spoke of you a good deal."\r\n\r\nIsabel waited. At the mention of Mr. Goodwood\'s name she had turned a\r\nlittle pale. "I\'m very sorry you did that," she observed at last.\r\n\r\n"It was a pleasure to me, and I liked the way he listened. I could have\r\ntalked a long time to such a listener; he was so quiet, so intense; he\r\ndrank it all in."\r\n\r\n"What did you say about me?" Isabel asked.\r\n\r\n"I said you were on the whole the finest creature I know."\r\n\r\n"I\'m very sorry for that. He thinks too well of me already; he oughtn\'t\r\nto be encouraged."\r\n\r\n"He\'s dying for a little encouragement. I see his face now, and his\r\nearnest absorbed look while I talked. I never saw an ugly man look so\r\nhandsome."\r\n\r\n"He\'s very simple-minded," said Isabel. "And he\'s not so ugly."\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing so simplifying as a grand passion."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not a grand passion; I\'m very sure it\'s not that."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t say that as if you were sure."\r\n\r\nIsabel gave rather a cold smile. "I shall say it better to Mr. Goodwood\r\nhimself."\r\n\r\n"He\'ll soon give you a chance," said Henrietta. Isabel offered no\r\nanswer to this assertion, which her companion made with an air of great\r\nconfidence. "He\'ll find you changed," the latter pursued. "You\'ve been\r\naffected by your new surroundings."\r\n\r\n"Very likely. I\'m affected by everything."\r\n\r\n"By everything but Mr. Goodwood!" Miss Stackpole exclaimed with a\r\nslightly harsh hilarity.\r\n\r\nIsabel failed even to smile back and in a moment she said: "Did he ask\r\nyou to speak to me?"\r\n\r\n"Not in so many words. But his eyes asked it--and his handshake, when he\r\nbade me good-bye."\r\n\r\n"Thank you for doing so." And Isabel turned away.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you\'re changed; you\'ve got new ideas over here," her friend\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\n"I hope so," said Isabel; "one should get as many new ideas as\r\npossible."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but they shouldn\'t interfere with the old ones when the old ones\r\nhave been the right ones."\r\n\r\nIsabel turned about again. "If you mean that I had any idea with regard\r\nto Mr. Goodwood--!" But she faltered before her friend\'s implacable\r\nglitter.\r\n\r\n"My dear child, you certainly encouraged him."\r\n\r\nIsabel made for the moment as if to deny this charge; instead of which,\r\nhowever, she presently answered: "It\'s very true. I did encourage him."\r\nAnd then she asked if her companion had learned from Mr. Goodwood\r\nwhat he intended to do. It was a concession to her curiosity, for she\r\ndisliked discussing the subject and found Henrietta wanting in delicacy.\r\n\r\n"I asked him, and he said he meant to do nothing," Miss Stackpole\r\nanswered. "But I don\'t believe that; he\'s not a man to do nothing. He\r\nis a man of high, bold action. Whatever happens to him he\'ll always do\r\nsomething, and whatever he does will always be right."\r\n\r\n"I quite believe that." Henrietta might be wanting in delicacy, but it\r\ntouched the girl, all the same, to hear this declaration.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you do care for him!" her visitor rang out.\r\n\r\n"Whatever he does will always be right," Isabel repeated. "When a man\'s\r\nof that infallible mould what does it matter to him what one feels?"\r\n\r\n"It may not matter to him, but it matters to one\'s self."\r\n\r\n"Ah, what it matters to me--that\'s not what we\'re discussing," said\r\nIsabel with a cold smile.\r\n\r\nThis time her companion was grave. "Well, I don\'t care; you have\r\nchanged. You\'re not the girl you were a few short weeks ago, and Mr.\r\nGoodwood will see it. I expect him here any day."\r\n\r\n"I hope he\'ll hate me then," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"I believe you hope it about as much as I believe him capable of it."\r\n\r\nTo this observation our heroine made no return; she was absorbed in the\r\nalarm given her by Henrietta\'s intimation that Caspar Goodwood would\r\npresent himself at Gardencourt. She pretended to herself, however,\r\nthat she thought the event impossible, and, later, she communicated her\r\ndisbelief to her friend. For the next forty-eight hours, nevertheless,\r\nshe stood prepared to hear the young man\'s name announced. The feeling\r\npressed upon her; it made the air sultry, as if there were to be a\r\nchange of weather; and the weather, socially speaking, had been so\r\nagreeable during Isabel\'s stay at Gardencourt that any change would be\r\nfor the worse. Her suspense indeed was dissipated the second day. She\r\nhad walked into the park in company with the sociable Bunchie, and\r\nafter strolling about for some time, in a manner at once listless and\r\nrestless, had seated herself on a garden-bench, within sight of the\r\nhouse, beneath a spreading beech, where, in a white dress ornamented\r\nwith black ribbons, she formed among the flickering shadows a graceful\r\nand harmonious image. She entertained herself for some moments with\r\ntalking to the little terrier, as to whom the proposal of an ownership\r\ndivided with her cousin had been applied as impartially as possible--as\r\nimpartially as Bunchie\'s own somewhat fickle and inconstant sympathies\r\nwould allow. But she was notified for the first time, on this occasion,\r\nof the finite character of Bunchie\'s intellect; hitherto she had been\r\nmainly struck with its extent. It seemed to her at last that she would\r\ndo well to take a book; formerly, when heavy-hearted, she had been\r\nable, with the help of some well-chosen volume, to transfer the seat\r\nof consciousness to the organ of pure reason. Of late, it was not to\r\nbe denied, literature had seemed a fading light, and even after she had\r\nreminded herself that her uncle\'s library was provided with a complete\r\nset of those authors which no gentleman\'s collection should be without,\r\nshe sat motionless and empty-handed, her eyes bent on the cool green\r\nturf of the lawn. Her meditations were presently interrupted by the\r\narrival of a servant who handed her a letter. The letter bore the\r\nLondon postmark and was addressed in a hand she knew--that came into her\r\nvision, already so held by him, with the vividness of the writer\'s voice\r\nor his face. This document proved short and may be given entire.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MISS ARCHER--I don\'t know whether you will have heard of my\r\ncoming to England, but even if you have not it will scarcely be a\r\nsurprise to you. You will remember that when you gave me my dismissal at\r\nAlbany, three months ago, I did not accept it. I protested against it.\r\nYou in fact appeared to accept my protest and to admit that I had the\r\nright on my side. I had come to see you with the hope that you would\r\nlet me bring you over to my conviction; my reasons for entertaining this\r\nhope had been of the best. But you disappointed it; I found you changed,\r\nand you were able to give me no reason for the change. You admitted that\r\nyou were unreasonable, and it was the only concession you would make;\r\nbut it was a very cheap one, because that\'s not your character. No, you\r\nare not, and you never will be, arbitrary or capricious. Therefore it is\r\nthat I believe you will let me see you again. You told me that I\'m not\r\ndisagreeable to you, and I believe it; for I don\'t see why that should\r\nbe. I shall always think of you; I shall never think of any one else.\r\nI came to England simply because you are here; I couldn\'t stay at home\r\nafter you had gone: I hated the country because you were not in it. If\r\nI like this country at present it is only because it holds you. I have\r\nbeen to England before, but have never enjoyed it much. May I not come\r\nand see you for half an hour? This at present is the dearest wish of\r\nyours faithfully,\r\n\r\nCASPAR GOODWOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIsabel read this missive with such deep attention that she had not\r\nperceived an approaching tread on the soft grass. Looking up, however,\r\nas she mechanically folded it she saw Lord Warburton standing before\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nShe put the letter into her pocket and offered her visitor a smile of\r\nwelcome, exhibiting no trace of discomposure and half surprised at her\r\ncoolness.\r\n\r\n"They told me you were out here," said Lord Warburton; "and as there\r\nwas no one in the drawing-room and it\'s really you that I wish to see, I\r\ncame out with no more ado."\r\n\r\nIsabel had got up; she felt a wish, for the moment, that he should not\r\nsit down beside her. "I was just going indoors."\r\n\r\n"Please don\'t do that; it\'s much jollier here; I\'ve ridden over from\r\nLockleigh; it\'s a lovely day." His smile was peculiarly friendly\r\nand pleasing, and his whole person seemed to emit that radiance of\r\ngood-feeling and good fare which had formed the charm of the girl\'s\r\nfirst impression of him. It surrounded him like a zone of fine June\r\nweather.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll walk about a little then," said Isabel, who could not divest\r\nherself of the sense of an intention on the part of her visitor and who\r\nwished both to elude the intention and to satisfy her curiosity about\r\nit. It had flashed upon her vision once before, and it had given her on\r\nthat occasion, as we know, a certain alarm. This alarm was composed of\r\nseveral elements, not all of which were disagreeable; she had indeed\r\nspent some days in analysing them and had succeeded in separating the\r\npleasant part of the idea of Lord Warburton\'s "making up" to her from\r\nthe painful. It may appear to some readers that the young lady was both\r\nprecipitate and unduly fastidious; but the latter of these facts, if\r\nthe charge be true, may serve to exonerate her from the discredit of\r\nthe former. She was not eager to convince herself that a territorial\r\nmagnate, as she had heard Lord Warburton called, was smitten with her\r\ncharms; the fact of a declaration from such a source carrying with it\r\nreally more questions than it would answer. She had received a strong\r\nimpression of his being a "personage," and she had occupied herself in\r\nexamining the image so conveyed. At the risk of adding to the evidence\r\nof her self-sufficiency it must be said that there had been moments\r\nwhen this possibility of admiration by a personage represented to her an\r\naggression almost to the degree of an affront, quite to the degree of\r\nan inconvenience. She had never yet known a personage; there had been no\r\npersonages, in this sense, in her life; there were probably none such at\r\nall in her native land. When she had thought of individual eminence she\r\nhad thought of it on the basis of character and wit--of what one\r\nmight like in a gentleman\'s mind and in his talk. She herself was a\r\ncharacter--she couldn\'t help being aware of that; and hitherto her\r\nvisions of a completed consciousness had concerned themselves largely\r\nwith moral images--things as to which the question would be whether they\r\npleased her sublime soul. Lord Warburton loomed up before her, largely\r\nand brightly, as a collection of attributes and powers which were not to\r\nbe measured by this simple rule, but which demanded a different sort of\r\nappreciation--an appreciation that the girl, with her habit of judging\r\nquickly and freely, felt she lacked patience to bestow. He appeared to\r\ndemand of her something that no one else, as it were, had presumed to\r\ndo. What she felt was that a territorial, a political, a social magnate\r\nhad conceived the design of drawing her into the system in which he\r\nrather invidiously lived and moved. A certain instinct, not imperious,\r\nbut persuasive, told her to resist--murmured to her that virtually\r\nshe had a system and an orbit of her own. It told her other things\r\nbesides--things which both contradicted and confirmed each other; that\r\na girl might do much worse than trust herself to such a man and that it\r\nwould be very interesting to see something of his system from his own\r\npoint of view; that on the other hand, however, there was evidently a\r\ngreat deal of it which she should regard only as a complication of every\r\nhour, and that even in the whole there was something stiff and stupid\r\nwhich would make it a burden. Furthermore there was a young man lately\r\ncome from America who had no system at all, but who had a character\r\nof which it was useless for her to try to persuade herself that the\r\nimpression on her mind had been light. The letter she carried in\r\nher pocket all sufficiently reminded her of the contrary. Smile not,\r\nhowever, I venture to repeat, at this simple young woman from Albany who\r\ndebated whether she should accept an English peer before he had offered\r\nhimself and who was disposed to believe that on the whole she could do\r\nbetter. She was a person of great good faith, and if there was a great\r\ndeal of folly in her wisdom those who judge her severely may have the\r\nsatisfaction of finding that, later, she became consistently wise only\r\nat the cost of an amount of folly which will constitute almost a direct\r\nappeal to charity.\r\n\r\nLord Warburton seemed quite ready to walk, to sit or to do anything that\r\nIsabel should propose, and he gave her this assurance with his usual air\r\nof being particularly pleased to exercise a social virtue. But he was,\r\nnevertheless, not in command of his emotions, and as he strolled beside\r\nher for a moment, in silence, looking at her without letting her know\r\nit, there was something embarrassed in his glance and his misdirected\r\nlaughter. Yes, assuredly--as we have touched on the point, we may return\r\nto it for a moment again--the English are the most romantic people in\r\nthe world and Lord Warburton was about to give an example of it. He was\r\nabout to take a step which would astonish all his friends and displease\r\na great many of them, and which had superficially nothing to recommend\r\nit. The young lady who trod the turf beside him had come from a queer\r\ncountry across the sea which he knew a good deal about; her antecedents,\r\nher associations were very vague to his mind except in so far as they\r\nwere generic, and in this sense they showed as distinct and unimportant.\r\nMiss Archer had neither a fortune nor the sort of beauty that justifies\r\na man to the multitude, and he calculated that he had spent about\r\ntwenty-six hours in her company. He had summed up all this--the\r\nperversity of the impulse, which had declined to avail itself of the\r\nmost liberal opportunities to subside, and the judgement of mankind, as\r\nexemplified particularly in the more quickly-judging half of it: he had\r\nlooked these things well in the face and then had dismissed them from\r\nhis thoughts. He cared no more for them than for the rosebud in his\r\nbuttonhole. It is the good fortune of a man who for the greater part of\r\na lifetime has abstained without effort from making himself disagreeable\r\nto his friends, that when the need comes for such a course it is not\r\ndiscredited by irritating associations.\r\n\r\n"I hope you had a pleasant ride," said Isabel, who observed her\r\ncompanion\'s hesitancy.\r\n\r\n"It would have been pleasant if for nothing else than that it brought me\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"Are you so fond of Gardencourt?" the girl asked, more and more sure\r\nthat he meant to make some appeal to her; wishing not to challenge him\r\nif he hesitated, and yet to keep all the quietness of her reason if he\r\nproceeded. It suddenly came upon her that her situation was one which a\r\nfew weeks ago she would have deemed deeply romantic: the park of an old\r\nEnglish country-house, with the foreground embellished by a "great" (as\r\nshe supposed) nobleman in the act of making love to a young lady who, on\r\ncareful inspection, should be found to present remarkable analogies with\r\nherself. But if she was now the heroine of the situation she succeeded\r\nscarcely the less in looking at it from the outside.\r\n\r\n"I care nothing for Gardencourt," said her companion. "I care only for\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve known me too short a time to have a right to say that, and I\r\ncan\'t believe you\'re serious."\r\n\r\nThese words of Isabel\'s were not perfectly sincere, for she had no doubt\r\nwhatever that he himself was. They were simply a tribute to the fact, of\r\nwhich she was perfectly aware, that those he had just uttered would\r\nhave excited surprise on the part of a vulgar world. And, moreover, if\r\nanything beside the sense she had already acquired that Lord Warburton\r\nwas not a loose thinker had been needed to convince her, the tone in\r\nwhich he replied would quite have served the purpose.\r\n\r\n"One\'s right in such a matter is not measured by the time, Miss Archer;\r\nit\'s measured by the feeling itself. If I were to wait three months it\r\nwould make no difference; I shall not be more sure of what I mean than I\r\nam to-day. Of course I\'ve seen you very little, but my impression dates\r\nfrom the very first hour we met. I lost no time, I fell in love with you\r\nthen. It was at first sight, as the novels say; I know now that\'s not a\r\nfancy-phrase, and I shall think better of novels for evermore. Those two\r\ndays I spent here settled it; I don\'t know whether you suspected I was\r\ndoing so, but I paid--mentally speaking I mean--the greatest possible\r\nattention to you. Nothing you said, nothing you did, was lost upon\r\nme. When you came to Lockleigh the other day--or rather when you went\r\naway--I was perfectly sure. Nevertheless I made up my mind to think it\r\nover and to question myself narrowly. I\'ve done so; all these days I\'ve\r\ndone nothing else. I don\'t make mistakes about such things; I\'m a very\r\njudicious animal. I don\'t go off easily, but when I\'m touched, it\'s\r\nfor life. It\'s for life, Miss Archer, it\'s for life," Lord Warburton\r\nrepeated in the kindest, tenderest, pleasantest voice Isabel had ever\r\nheard, and looking at her with eyes charged with the light of a passion\r\nthat had sifted itself clear of the baser parts of emotion--the heat,\r\nthe violence, the unreason--and that burned as steadily as a lamp in a\r\nwindless place.\r\n\r\nBy tacit consent, as he talked, they had walked more and more slowly,\r\nand at last they stopped and he took her hand. "Ah, Lord Warburton, how\r\nlittle you know me!" Isabel said very gently. Gently too she drew her\r\nhand away.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t taunt me with that; that I don\'t know you better makes me unhappy\r\nenough already; it\'s all my loss. But that\'s what I want, and it seems\r\nto me I\'m taking the best way. If you\'ll be my wife, then I shall know\r\nyou, and when I tell you all the good I think of you you\'ll not be able\r\nto say it\'s from ignorance."\r\n\r\n"If you know me little I know you even less," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"You mean that, unlike yourself, I may not improve on acquaintance? Ah,\r\nof course that\'s very possible. But think, to speak to you as I do,\r\nhow determined I must be to try and give satisfaction! You do like me\r\nrather, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I like you very much, Lord Warburton," she answered; and at this moment\r\nshe liked him immensely.\r\n\r\n"I thank you for saying that; it shows you don\'t regard me as a\r\nstranger. I really believe I\'ve filled all the other relations of life\r\nvery creditably, and I don\'t see why I shouldn\'t fill this one--in which\r\nI offer myself to you--seeing that I care so much more about it. Ask the\r\npeople who know me well; I\'ve friends who\'ll speak for me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t need the recommendation of your friends," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"Ah now, that\'s delightful of you. You believe in me yourself."\r\n\r\n"Completely," Isabel declared. She quite glowed there, inwardly, with\r\nthe pleasure of feeling she did.\r\n\r\nThe light in her companion\'s eyes turned into a smile, and he gave a\r\nlong exhalation of joy. "If you\'re mistaken, Miss Archer, let me lose\r\nall I possess!"\r\n\r\nShe wondered whether he meant this for a reminder that he was rich, and,\r\non the instant, felt sure that he didn\'t. He was thinking that, as he\r\nwould have said himself; and indeed he might safely leave it to the\r\nmemory of any interlocutor, especially of one to whom he was offering\r\nhis hand. Isabel had prayed that she might not be agitated, and her mind\r\nwas tranquil enough, even while she listened and asked herself what it\r\nwas best she should say, to indulge in this incidental criticism. What\r\nshe should say, had she asked herself? Her foremost wish was to say\r\nsomething if possible not less kind than what he had said to her. His\r\nwords had carried perfect conviction with them; she felt she did, all so\r\nmysteriously, matter to him. "I thank you more than I can say for your\r\noffer," she returned at last. "It does me great honour."\r\n\r\n"Ah, don\'t say that!" he broke out. "I was afraid you\'d say something\r\nlike that. I don\'t see what you\'ve to do with that sort of thing. I\r\ndon\'t see why you should thank me--it\'s I who ought to thank you for\r\nlistening to me: a man you know so little coming down on you with such\r\na thumper! Of course it\'s a great question; I must tell you that\r\nI\'d rather ask it than have it to answer myself. But the way you\'ve\r\nlistened--or at least your having listened at all--gives me some hope."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t hope too much," Isabel said.\r\n\r\n"Oh Miss Archer!" her companion murmured, smiling again, in his\r\nseriousness, as if such a warning might perhaps be taken but as the play\r\nof high spirits, the exuberance of elation.\r\n\r\n"Should you be greatly surprised if I were to beg you not to hope at\r\nall?" Isabel asked.\r\n\r\n"Surprised? I don\'t know what you mean by surprise. It wouldn\'t be that;\r\nit would be a feeling very much worse."\r\n\r\nIsabel walked on again; she was silent for some minutes. "I\'m very sure\r\nthat, highly as I already think of you, my opinion of you, if I should\r\nknow you well, would only rise. But I\'m by no means sure that you\r\nwouldn\'t be disappointed. And I say that not in the least out of\r\nconventional modesty; it\'s perfectly sincere."\r\n\r\n"I\'m willing to risk it, Miss Archer," her companion replied.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a great question, as you say. It\'s a very difficult question."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t expect you of course to answer it outright. Think it over as\r\nlong as may be necessary. If I can gain by waiting I\'ll gladly wait a\r\nlong time. Only remember that in the end my dearest happiness depends on\r\nyour answer."\r\n\r\n"I should be very sorry to keep you in suspense," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t mind. I\'d much rather have a good answer six months hence\r\nthan a bad one to-day."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s very probable that even six months hence I shouldn\'t be able\r\nto give you one that you\'d think good."\r\n\r\n"Why not, since you really like me?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, you must never doubt that," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"Well then, I don\'t see what more you ask!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s not what I ask; it\'s what I can give. I don\'t think I should suit\r\nyou; I really don\'t think I should."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t worry about that. That\'s my affair. You needn\'t be a better\r\nroyalist than the king."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not only that," said Isabel; "but I\'m not sure I wish to marry any\r\none."\r\n\r\n"Very likely you don\'t. I\'ve no doubt a great many women begin that\r\nway," said his lordship, who, be it averred, did not in the least\r\nbelieve in the axiom he thus beguiled his anxiety by uttering. "But\r\nthey\'re frequently persuaded."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s because they want to be!" And Isabel lightly laughed. Her\r\nsuitor\'s countenance fell, and he looked at her for a while in silence.\r\n"I\'m afraid it\'s my being an Englishman that makes you hesitate," he\r\nsaid presently. "I know your uncle thinks you ought to marry in your own\r\ncountry."\r\n\r\nIsabel listened to this assertion with some interest; it had never\r\noccurred to her that Mr. Touchett was likely to discuss her matrimonial\r\nprospects with Lord Warburton. "Has he told you that?"\r\n\r\n"I remember his making the remark. He spoke perhaps of Americans\r\ngenerally."\r\n\r\n"He appears himself to have found it very pleasant to live in England."\r\nIsabel spoke in a manner that might have seemed a little perverse, but\r\nwhich expressed both her constant perception of her uncle\'s outward\r\nfelicity and her general disposition to elude any obligation to take a\r\nrestricted view.\r\n\r\nIt gave her companion hope, and he immediately cried with warmth: "Ah,\r\nmy dear Miss Archer, old England\'s a very good sort of country, you\r\nknow! And it will be still better when we\'ve furbished it up a little."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t furbish it, Lord Warburton--, leave it alone. I like it this\r\nway."\r\n\r\n"Well then, if you like it, I\'m more and more unable to see your\r\nobjection to what I propose."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I can\'t make you understand."\r\n\r\n"You ought at least to try. I\'ve a fair intelligence. Are you\r\nafraid--afraid of the climate? We can easily live elsewhere, you know.\r\nYou can pick out your climate, the whole world over."\r\n\r\nThese words were uttered with a breadth of candour that was like the\r\nembrace of strong arms--that was like the fragrance straight in her\r\nface, and by his clean, breathing lips, of she knew not what strange\r\ngardens, what charged airs. She would have given her little finger at\r\nthat moment to feel strongly and simply the impulse to answer: "Lord\r\nWarburton, it\'s impossible for me to do better in this wonderful world,\r\nI think, than commit myself, very gratefully, to your loyalty." But\r\nthough she was lost in admiration of her opportunity she managed to move\r\nback into the deepest shade of it, even as some wild, caught creature in\r\na vast cage. The "splendid" security so offered her was not the greatest\r\nshe could conceive. What she finally bethought herself of saying was\r\nsomething very different--something that deferred the need of really\r\nfacing her crisis. "Don\'t think me unkind if I ask you to say no more\r\nabout this to-day."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, certainly!" her companion cried. "I wouldn\'t bore you for\r\nthe world."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve given me a great deal to think about, and I promise you to do it\r\njustice."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all I ask of you, of course--and that you\'ll remember how\r\nabsolutely my happiness is in your hands."\r\n\r\nIsabel listened with extreme respect to this admonition, but she said\r\nafter a minute: "I must tell you that what I shall think about is some\r\nway of letting you know that what you ask is impossible--letting you\r\nknow it without making you miserable."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no way to do that, Miss Archer. I won\'t say that if you refuse\r\nme you\'ll kill me; I shall not die of it. But I shall do worse; I shall\r\nlive to no purpose."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll live to marry a better woman than I."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say that, please," said Lord Warburton very gravely. "That\'s fair\r\nto neither of us."\r\n\r\n"To marry a worse one then."\r\n\r\n"If there are better women than you I prefer the bad ones. That\'s all I\r\ncan say," he went on with the same earnestness. "There\'s no accounting\r\nfor tastes."\r\n\r\nHis gravity made her feel equally grave, and she showed it by again\r\nrequesting him to drop the subject for the present. "I\'ll speak to you\r\nmyself--very soon. Perhaps I shall write to you."\r\n\r\n"At your convenience, yes," he replied. "Whatever time you take, it must\r\nseem to me long, and I suppose I must make the best of that."\r\n\r\n"I shall not keep you in suspense; I only want to collect my mind a\r\nlittle."\r\n\r\nHe gave a melancholy sigh and stood looking at her a moment, with his\r\nhands behind him, giving short nervous shakes to his hunting-crop. "Do\r\nyou know I\'m very much afraid of it--of that remarkable mind of yours?"\r\n\r\nOur heroine\'s biographer can scarcely tell why, but the question made\r\nher start and brought a conscious blush to her cheek. She returned his\r\nlook a moment, and then with a note in her voice that might almost have\r\nappealed to his compassion, "So am I, my lord!" she oddly exclaimed.\r\n\r\nHis compassion was not stirred, however; all he possessed of the faculty\r\nof pity was needed at home. "Ah! be merciful, be merciful," he murmured.\r\n\r\n"I think you had better go," said Isabel. "I\'ll write to you."\r\n\r\n"Very good; but whatever you write I\'ll come and see you, you know." And\r\nthen he stood reflecting, his eyes fixed on the observant countenance of\r\nBunchie, who had the air of having understood all that had been said\r\nand of pretending to carry off the indiscretion by a simulated fit of\r\ncuriosity as to the roots of an ancient oak. "There\'s one thing more,"\r\nhe went on. "You know, if you don\'t like Lockleigh--if you think it\'s\r\ndamp or anything of that sort--you need never go within fifty miles of\r\nit. It\'s not damp, by the way; I\'ve had the house thoroughly examined;\r\nit\'s perfectly safe and right. But if you shouldn\'t fancy it you needn\'t\r\ndream of living in it. There\'s no difficulty whatever about that; there\r\nare plenty of houses. I thought I\'d just mention it; some people don\'t\r\nlike a moat, you know. Good-bye."\r\n\r\n"I adore a moat," said Isabel. "Good-bye."\r\n\r\nHe held out his hand, and she gave him hers a moment--a moment long\r\nenough for him to bend his handsome bared head and kiss it. Then, still\r\nagitating, in his mastered emotion, his implement of the chase, he\r\nwalked rapidly away. He was evidently much upset.\r\n\r\nIsabel herself was upset, but she had not been affected as she would\r\nhave imagined. What she felt was not a great responsibility, a great\r\ndifficulty of choice; it appeared to her there had been no choice in the\r\nquestion. She couldn\'t marry Lord Warburton; the idea failed to support\r\nany enlightened prejudice in favour of the free exploration of life that\r\nshe had hitherto entertained or was now capable of entertaining.\r\nShe must write this to him, she must convince him, and that duty was\r\ncomparatively simple. But what disturbed her, in the sense that it\r\nstruck her with wonderment, was this very fact that it cost her so\r\nlittle to refuse a magnificent "chance." With whatever qualifications\r\none would, Lord Warburton had offered her a great opportunity; the\r\nsituation might have discomforts, might contain oppressive, might\r\ncontain narrowing elements, might prove really but a stupefying anodyne;\r\nbut she did her sex no injustice in believing that nineteen women out of\r\ntwenty would have accommodated themselves to it without a pang. Why then\r\nupon her also should it not irresistibly impose itself? Who was she,\r\nwhat was she, that she should hold herself superior? What view of\r\nlife, what design upon fate, what conception of happiness, had she that\r\npretended to be larger than these large these fabulous occasions? If she\r\nwouldn\'t do such a thing as that then she must do great things, she must\r\ndo something greater. Poor Isabel found ground to remind herself from\r\ntime to time that she must not be too proud, and nothing could be\r\nmore sincere than her prayer to be delivered from such a danger: the\r\nisolation and loneliness of pride had for her mind the horror of a\r\ndesert place. If it had been pride that interfered with her accepting\r\nLord Warburton such a _b\xeatise_ was singularly misplaced; and she was so\r\nconscious of liking him that she ventured to assure herself it was the\r\nvery softness, and the fine intelligence, of sympathy. She liked him too\r\nmuch to marry him, that was the truth; something assured her there was\r\na fallacy somewhere in the glowing logic of the proposition--as he saw\r\nit--even though she mightn\'t put her very finest finger-point on it;\r\nand to inflict upon a man who offered so much a wife with a tendency to\r\ncriticise would be a peculiarly discreditable act. She had promised him\r\nshe would consider his question, and when, after he had left her, she\r\nwandered back to the bench where he had found her and lost herself in\r\nmeditation, it might have seemed that she was keeping her vow. But\r\nthis was not the case; she was wondering if she were not a cold, hard,\r\npriggish person, and, on her at last getting up and going rather\r\nquickly back to the house, felt, as she had said to her friend, really\r\nfrightened at herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nIt was this feeling and not the wish to ask advice--she had no desire\r\nwhatever for that--that led her to speak to her uncle of what had taken\r\nplace. She wished to speak to some one; she should feel more natural,\r\nmore human, and her uncle, for this purpose, presented himself in a\r\nmore attractive light than either her aunt or her friend Henrietta. Her\r\ncousin of course was a possible confidant; but she would have had to do\r\nherself violence to air this special secret to Ralph. So the next day,\r\nafter breakfast, she sought her occasion. Her uncle never left his\r\napartment till the afternoon, but he received his cronies, as he said,\r\nin his dressing-room. Isabel had quite taken her place in the class\r\nso designated, which, for the rest, included the old man\'s son, his\r\nphysician, his personal servant, and even Miss Stackpole. Mrs. Touchett\r\ndid not figure in the list, and this was an obstacle the less to\r\nIsabel\'s finding her host alone. He sat in a complicated mechanical\r\nchair, at the open window of his room, looking westward over the park\r\nand the river, with his newspapers and letters piled up beside him,\r\nhis toilet freshly and minutely made, and his smooth, speculative face\r\ncomposed to benevolent expectation.\r\n\r\nShe approached her point directly. "I think I ought to let you know that\r\nLord Warburton has asked me to marry him. I suppose I ought to tell my\r\naunt; but it seems best to tell you first."\r\n\r\nThe old man expressed no surprise, but thanked her for the confidence\r\nshe showed him. "Do you mind telling me whether you accepted him?" he\r\nthen enquired.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve not answered him definitely yet; I\'ve taken a little time to think\r\nof it, because that seems more respectful. But I shall not accept him."\r\n\r\nMr. Touchett made no comment upon this; he had the air of thinking that,\r\nwhatever interest he might take in the matter from the point of view of\r\nsociability, he had no active voice in it. "Well, I told you you\'d be a\r\nsuccess over here. Americans are highly appreciated."\r\n\r\n"Very highly indeed," said Isabel. "But at the cost of seeming both\r\ntasteless and ungrateful, I don\'t think I can marry Lord Warburton."\r\n\r\n"Well," her uncle went on, "of course an old man can\'t judge for a young\r\nlady. I\'m glad you didn\'t ask me before you made up your mind. I suppose\r\nI ought to tell you," he added slowly, but as if it were not of much\r\nconsequence, "that I\'ve known all about it these three days."\r\n\r\n"About Lord Warburton\'s state of mind?"\r\n\r\n"About his intentions, as they say here. He wrote me a very pleasant\r\nletter, telling me all about them. Should you like to see his letter?"\r\nthe old man obligingly asked.\r\n\r\n"Thank you; I don\'t think I care about that. But I\'m glad he wrote to\r\nyou; it was right that he should, and he would be certain to do what was\r\nright."\r\n\r\n"Ah well, I guess you do like him!" Mr. Touchett declared. "You needn\'t\r\npretend you don\'t."\r\n\r\n"I like him extremely; I\'m very free to admit that. But I don\'t wish to\r\nmarry any one just now."\r\n\r\n"You think some one may come along whom you may like better. Well,\r\nthat\'s very likely," said Mr. Touchett, who appeared to wish to show his\r\nkindness to the girl by easing off her decision, as it were, and finding\r\ncheerful reasons for it.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care if I don\'t meet any one else. I like Lord Warburton quite\r\nwell enough." she fell into that appearance of a sudden change of\r\npoint of view with which she sometimes startled and even displeased her\r\ninterlocutors.\r\n\r\nHer uncle, however, seemed proof against either of these impressions.\r\n"He\'s a very fine man," he resumed in a tone which might have passed\r\nfor that of encouragement. "His letter was one of the pleasantest I\'ve\r\nreceived for some weeks. I suppose one of the reasons I liked it was\r\nthat it was all about you; that is all except the part that was about\r\nhimself. I suppose he told you all that."\r\n\r\n"He would have told me everything I wished to ask him," Isabel said.\r\n\r\n"But you didn\'t feel curious?"\r\n\r\n"My curiosity would have been idle--once I had determined to decline his\r\noffer."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t find it sufficiently attractive?" Mr. Touchett enquired.\r\n\r\nShe was silent a little. "I suppose it was that," she presently\r\nadmitted. "But I don\'t know why."\r\n\r\n"Fortunately ladies are not obliged to give reasons," said her uncle.\r\n"There\'s a great deal that\'s attractive about such an idea; but I don\'t\r\nsee why the English should want to entice us away from our native land.\r\nI know that we try to attract them over there, but that\'s because our\r\npopulation is insufficient. Here, you know, they\'re rather crowded.\r\nHowever, I presume there\'s room for charming young ladies everywhere."\r\n\r\n"There seems to have been room here for you," said Isabel, whose eyes\r\nhad been wandering over the large pleasure-spaces of the park.\r\n\r\nMr. Touchett gave a shrewd, conscious smile. "There\'s room everywhere,\r\nmy dear, if you\'ll pay for it. I sometimes think I\'ve paid too much for\r\nthis. Perhaps you also might have to pay too much."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I might," the girl replied.\r\n\r\nThat suggestion gave her something more definite to rest on than she\r\nhad found in her own thoughts, and the fact of this association of her\r\nuncle\'s mild acuteness with her dilemma seemed to prove that she was\r\nconcerned with the natural and reasonable emotions of life and\r\nnot altogether a victim to intellectual eagerness and vague\r\nambitions--ambitions reaching beyond Lord Warburton\'s beautiful appeal,\r\nreaching to something indefinable and possibly not commendable. In so\r\nfar as the indefinable had an influence upon Isabel\'s behaviour at this\r\njuncture, it was not the conception, even unformulated, of a union with\r\nCaspar Goodwood; for however she might have resisted conquest at her\r\nEnglish suitor\'s large quiet hands she was at least as far removed\r\nfrom the disposition to let the young man from Boston take positive\r\npossession of her. The sentiment in which she sought refuge after\r\nreading his letter was a critical view of his having come abroad; for it\r\nwas part of the influence he had upon her that he seemed to deprive her\r\nof the sense of freedom. There was a disagreeably strong push, a kind\r\nof hardness of presence, in his way of rising before her. She had been\r\nhaunted at moments by the image, by the danger, of his disapproval and\r\nhad wondered--a consideration she had never paid in equal degree to any\r\none else--whether he would like what she did. The difficulty was that\r\nmore than any man she had ever known, more than poor Lord Warburton (she\r\nhad begun now to give his lordship the benefit of this epithet), Caspar\r\nGoodwood expressed for her an energy--and she had already felt it as a\r\npower that was of his very nature. It was in no degree a matter of\r\nhis "advantages"--it was a matter of the spirit that sat in his\r\nclear-burning eyes like some tireless watcher at a window. She might\r\nlike it or not, but he insisted, ever, with his whole weight and force:\r\neven in one\'s usual contact with him one had to reckon with that. The\r\nidea of a diminished liberty was particularly disagreeable to her at\r\npresent, since she had just given a sort of personal accent to her\r\nindependence by looking so straight at Lord Warburton\'s big bribe and\r\nyet turning away from it. Sometimes Caspar Goodwood had seemed to range\r\nhimself on the side of her destiny, to be the stubbornest fact she knew;\r\nshe said to herself at such moments that she might evade him for a time,\r\nbut that she must make terms with him at last--terms which would be\r\ncertain to be favourable to himself. Her impulse had been to avail\r\nherself of the things that helped her to resist such an obligation;\r\nand this impulse had been much concerned in her eager acceptance of her\r\naunt\'s invitation, which had come to her at an hour when she expected\r\nfrom day to day to see Mr. Goodwood and when she was glad to have an\r\nanswer ready for something she was sure he would say to her. When she\r\nhad told him at Albany, on the evening of Mrs. Touchett\'s visit, that\r\nshe couldn\'t then discuss difficult questions, dazzled as she was by\r\nthe great immediate opening of her aunt\'s offer of "Europe," he declared\r\nthat this was no answer at all; and it was now to obtain a better one\r\nthat he was following her across the sea. To say to herself that he was\r\na kind of grim fate was well enough for a fanciful young woman who was\r\nable to take much for granted in him; but the reader has a right to a\r\nnearer and a clearer view.\r\n\r\nHe was the son of a proprietor of well-known cotton-mills in\r\nMassachusetts--a gentleman who had accumulated a considerable fortune in\r\nthe exercise of this industry. Caspar at present managed the works, and\r\nwith a judgement and a temper which, in spite of keen competition and\r\nlanguid years, had kept their prosperity from dwindling. He had received\r\nthe better part of his education at Harvard College, where, however, he\r\nhad gained renown rather as a gymnast and an oarsman than as a gleaner\r\nof more dispersed knowledge. Later on he had learned that the finer\r\nintelligence too could vault and pull and strain--might even, breaking\r\nthe record, treat itself to rare exploits. He had thus discovered in\r\nhimself a sharp eye for the mystery of mechanics, and had invented an\r\nimprovement in the cotton-spinning process which was now largely used\r\nand was known by his name. You might have seen it in the newspapers in\r\nconnection with this fruitful contrivance; assurance of which he\r\nhad given to Isabel by showing her in the columns of the New York\r\n_Interviewer_ an exhaustive article on the Goodwood patent--an article not\r\nprepared by Miss Stackpole, friendly as she had proved herself to his\r\nmore sentimental interests. There were intricate, bristling things he\r\nrejoiced in; he liked to organise, to contend, to administer; he could\r\nmake people work his will, believe in him, march before him and justify\r\nhim. This was the art, as they said, of managing men--which rested, in\r\nhim, further, on a bold though brooding ambition. It struck those\r\nwho knew him well that he might do greater things than carry on a\r\ncotton-factory; there was nothing cottony about Caspar Goodwood, and\r\nhis friends took for granted that he would somehow and somewhere\r\nwrite himself in bigger letters. But it was as if something large and\r\nconfused, something dark and ugly, would have to call upon him: he was\r\nnot after all in harmony with mere smug peace and greed and gain, an\r\norder of things of which the vital breath was ubiquitous advertisement.\r\nIt pleased Isabel to believe that he might have ridden, on a plunging\r\nsteed, the whirlwind of a great war--a war like the Civil strife that\r\nhad overdarkened her conscious childhood and his ripening youth.\r\n\r\nShe liked at any rate this idea of his being by character and in fact a\r\nmover of men--liked it much better than some other points in his nature\r\nand aspect. She cared nothing for his cotton-mill--the Goodwood patent\r\nleft her imagination absolutely cold. She wished him no ounce less of\r\nhis manhood, but she sometimes thought he would be rather nicer if he\r\nlooked, for instance, a little differently. His jaw was too square and\r\nset and his figure too straight and stiff: these things suggested a want\r\nof easy consonance with the deeper rhythms of life. Then she viewed with\r\nreserve a habit he had of dressing always in the same manner; it was\r\nnot apparently that he wore the same clothes continually, for, on the\r\ncontrary, his garments had a way of looking rather too new. But they all\r\nseemed of the same piece; the figure, the stuff, was so drearily usual.\r\nShe had reminded herself more than once that this was a frivolous\r\nobjection to a person of his importance; and then she had amended the\r\nrebuke by saying that it would be a frivolous objection only if she\r\nwere in love with him. She was not in love with him and therefore might\r\ncriticise his small defects as well as his great--which latter consisted\r\nin the collective reproach of his being too serious, or, rather, not of\r\nhis being so, since one could never be, but certainly of his seeming so.\r\nHe showed his appetites and designs too simply and artlessly; when one\r\nwas alone with him he talked too much about the same subject, and when\r\nother people were present he talked too little about anything. And yet\r\nhe was of supremely strong, clean make--which was so much she saw the\r\ndifferent fitted parts of him as she had seen, in museums and portraits,\r\nthe different fitted parts of armoured warriors--in plates of steel\r\nhandsomely inlaid with gold. It was very strange: where, ever, was any\r\ntangible link between her impression and her act? Caspar Goodwood had\r\nnever corresponded to her idea of a delightful person, and she supposed\r\nthat this was why he left her so harshly critical. When, however, Lord\r\nWarburton, who not only did correspond with it, but gave an extension to\r\nthe term, appealed to her approval, she found herself still unsatisfied.\r\nIt was certainly strange.\r\n\r\nThe sense of her incoherence was not a help to answering Mr. Goodwood\'s\r\nletter, and Isabel determined to leave it a while unhonoured. If he\r\nhad determined to persecute her he must take the consequences; foremost\r\namong which was his being left to perceive how little it charmed her\r\nthat he should come down to Gardencourt. She was already liable to the\r\nincursions of one suitor at this place, and though it might be pleasant\r\nto be appreciated in opposite quarters there was a kind of grossness in\r\nentertaining two such passionate pleaders at once, even in a case where\r\nthe entertainment should consist of dismissing them. She made no\r\nreply to Mr. Goodwood; but at the end of three days she wrote to Lord\r\nWarburton, and the letter belongs to our history.\r\n\r\nDEAR LORD WARBURTON--A great deal of earnest thought has not led me to\r\nchange my mind about the suggestion you were so kind as to make me the\r\nother day. I am not, I am really and truly not, able to regard you\r\nin the light of a companion for life; or to think of your home--your\r\nvarious homes--as the settled seat of my existence. These things cannot\r\nbe reasoned about, and I very earnestly entreat you not to return to\r\nthe subject we discussed so exhaustively. We see our lives from our own\r\npoint of view; that is the privilege of the weakest and humblest of us;\r\nand I shall never be able to see mine in the manner you proposed. Kindly\r\nlet this suffice you, and do me the justice to believe that I have given\r\nyour proposal the deeply respectful consideration it deserves. It is\r\nwith this very great regard that I remain sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nISABEL ARCHER.\r\n\r\nWhile the author of this missive was making up her mind to dispatch it\r\nHenrietta Stackpole formed a resolve which was accompanied by no demur.\r\nShe invited Ralph Touchett to take a walk with her in the garden, and\r\nwhen he had assented with that alacrity which seemed constantly to\r\ntestify to his high expectations, she informed him that she had a favour\r\nto ask of him. It may be admitted that at this information the young man\r\nflinched; for we know that Miss Stackpole had struck him as apt to push\r\nan advantage. The alarm was unreasoned, however; for he was clear about\r\nthe area of her indiscretion as little as advised of its vertical depth,\r\nand he made a very civil profession of the desire to serve her. He\r\nwas afraid of her and presently told her so. "When you look at me in a\r\ncertain way my knees knock together, my faculties desert me; I\'m filled\r\nwith trepidation and I ask only for strength to execute your commands.\r\nYou\'ve an address that I\'ve never encountered in any woman."\r\n\r\n"Well," Henrietta replied good-humouredly, "if I had not known before\r\nthat you were trying somehow to abash me I should know it now. Of course\r\nI\'m easy game--I was brought up with such different customs and ideas.\r\nI\'m not used to your arbitrary standards, and I\'ve never been spoken to\r\nin America as you have spoken to me. If a gentleman conversing with me\r\nover there were to speak to me like that I shouldn\'t know what to make\r\nof it. We take everything more naturally over there, and, after all,\r\nwe\'re a great deal more simple. I admit that; I\'m very simple myself.\r\nOf course if you choose to laugh at me for it you\'re very welcome; but I\r\nthink on the whole I would rather be myself than you. I\'m quite content\r\nto be myself; I don\'t want to change. There are plenty of people that\r\nappreciate me just as I am. It\'s true they\'re nice fresh free-born\r\nAmericans!" Henrietta had lately taken up the tone of helpless innocence\r\nand large concession. "I want you to assist me a little," she went on.\r\n"I don\'t care in the least whether I amuse you while you do so; or,\r\nrather, I\'m perfectly willing your amusement should be your reward. I\r\nwant you to help me about Isabel."\r\n\r\n"Has she injured you?" Ralph asked.\r\n\r\n"If she had I shouldn\'t mind, and I should never tell you. What I\'m\r\nafraid of is that she\'ll injure herself."\r\n\r\n"I think that\'s very possible," said Ralph.\r\n\r\nHis companion stopped in the garden-walk, fixing on him perhaps the very\r\ngaze that unnerved him. "That too would amuse you, I suppose. The way\r\nyou do say things! I never heard any one so indifferent."\r\n\r\n"To Isabel? Ah, not that!"\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'re not in love with her, I hope."\r\n\r\n"How can that be, when I\'m in love with Another?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re in love with yourself, that\'s the Other!" Miss Stackpole\r\ndeclared. "Much good may it do you! But if you wish to be serious once\r\nin your life here\'s a chance; and if you really care for your cousin\r\nhere\'s an opportunity to prove it. I don\'t expect you to understand her;\r\nthat\'s too much to ask. But you needn\'t do that to grant my favour. I\'ll\r\nsupply the necessary intelligence."\r\n\r\n"I shall enjoy that immensely!" Ralph exclaimed. "I\'ll be Caliban and\r\nyou shall be Ariel."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not at all like Caliban, because you\'re sophisticated, and\r\nCaliban was not. But I\'m not talking about imaginary characters; I\'m\r\ntalking about Isabel. Isabel\'s intensely real. What I wish to tell you\r\nis that I find her fearfully changed."\r\n\r\n"Since you came, do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Since I came and before I came. She\'s not the same as she once so\r\nbeautifully was."\r\n\r\n"As she was in America?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, in America. I suppose you know she comes from there. She can\'t\r\nhelp it, but she does."\r\n\r\n"Do you want to change her back again?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I do, and I want you to help me."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Ralph, "I\'m only Caliban; I\'m not Prospero."\r\n\r\n"You were Prospero enough to make her what she has become. You\'ve acted\r\non Isabel Archer since she came here, Mr. Touchett."\r\n\r\n"I, my dear Miss Stackpole? Never in the world. Isabel Archer has acted\r\non me--yes; she acts on every one. But I\'ve been absolutely passive."\r\n\r\n"You\'re too passive then. You had better stir yourself and be careful.\r\nIsabel\'s changing every day; she\'s drifting away--right out to sea. I\'ve\r\nwatched her and I can see it. She\'s not the bright American girl she\r\nwas. She\'s taking different views, a different colour, and turning away\r\nfrom her old ideals. I want to save those ideals, Mr. Touchett, and\r\nthat\'s where you come in."\r\n\r\n"Not surely as an ideal?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I hope not," Henrietta replied promptly. "I\'ve got a fear in my\r\nheart that she\'s going to marry one of these fell Europeans, and I want\r\nto prevent it.\r\n\r\n"Ah, I see," cried Ralph; "and to prevent it you want me to step in and\r\nmarry her?"\r\n\r\n"Not quite; that remedy would be as bad as the disease, for you\'re the\r\ntypical, the fell European from whom I wish to rescue her. No; I wish\r\nyou to take an interest in another person--a young man to whom she once\r\ngave great encouragement and whom she now doesn\'t seem to think good\r\nenough. He\'s a thoroughly grand man and a very dear friend of mine, and\r\nI wish very much you would invite him to pay a visit here."\r\n\r\nRalph was much puzzled by this appeal, and it is perhaps not to the\r\ncredit of his purity of mind that he failed to look at it at first in\r\nthe simplest light. It wore, to his eyes, a tortuous air, and his fault\r\nwas that he was not quite sure that anything in the world could really\r\nbe as candid as this request of Miss Stackpole\'s appeared. That a young\r\nwoman should demand that a gentleman whom she described as her very dear\r\nfriend should be furnished with an opportunity to make himself agreeable\r\nto another young woman, a young woman whose attention had wandered and\r\nwhose charms were greater--this was an anomaly which for the moment\r\nchallenged all his ingenuity of interpretation. To read between the\r\nlines was easier than to follow the text, and to suppose that Miss\r\nStackpole wished the gentleman invited to Gardencourt on her own account\r\nwas the sign not so much of a vulgar as of an embarrassed mind. Even\r\nfrom this venial act of vulgarity, however, Ralph was saved, and saved\r\nby a force that I can only speak of as inspiration. With no more outward\r\nlight on the subject than he already possessed he suddenly acquired the\r\nconviction that it would be a sovereign injustice to the correspondent\r\nof the _Interviewer_ to assign a dishonourable motive to any act of hers.\r\nThis conviction passed into his mind with extreme rapidity; it was\r\nperhaps kindled by the pure radiance of the young lady\'s imperturbable\r\ngaze. He returned this challenge a moment, consciously, resisting an\r\ninclination to frown as one frowns in the presence of larger luminaries.\r\n"Who\'s the gentleman you speak of?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Caspar Goodwood--of Boston. He has been extremely attentive to\r\nIsabel--just as devoted to her as he can live. He has followed her out\r\nhere and he\'s at present in London. I don\'t know his address, but I\r\nguess I can obtain it."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve never heard of him," said Ralph.\r\n\r\n"Well, I suppose you haven\'t heard of every one. I don\'t believe he has\r\never heard of you; but that\'s no reason why Isabel shouldn\'t marry him."\r\n\r\nRalph gave a mild ambiguous laugh. "What a rage you have for marrying\r\npeople! Do you remember how you wanted to marry me the other day?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got over that. You don\'t know how to take such ideas. Mr. Goodwood\r\ndoes, however; and that\'s what I like about him. He\'s a splendid man and\r\na perfect gentleman, and Isabel knows it."\r\n\r\n"Is she very fond of him?"\r\n\r\n"If she isn\'t she ought to be. He\'s simply wrapped up in her."\r\n\r\n"And you wish me to ask him here," said Ralph reflectively.\r\n\r\n"It would be an act of true hospitality."\r\n\r\n"Caspar Goodwood," Ralph continued--"it\'s rather a striking name."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care anything about his name. It might be Ezekiel Jenkins, and\r\nI should say the same. He\'s the only man I have ever seen whom I think\r\nworthy of Isabel."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a very devoted friend," said Ralph.\r\n\r\n"Of course I am. If you say that to pour scorn on me I don\'t care."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say it to pour scorn on you; I\'m very much struck with it."\r\n\r\n"You\'re more satiric than ever, but I advise you not to laugh at Mr.\r\nGoodwood."\r\n\r\n"I assure you I\'m very serious; you ought to understand that," said\r\nRalph.\r\n\r\nIn a moment his companion understood it. "I believe you are; now you\'re\r\ntoo serious."\r\n\r\n"You\'re difficult to please."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'re very serious indeed. You won\'t invite Mr. Goodwood."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Ralph. "I\'m capable of strange things. Tell me a\r\nlittle about Mr. Goodwood. What\'s he like?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s just the opposite of you. He\'s at the head of a cotton-factory; a\r\nvery fine one."\r\n\r\n"Has he pleasant manners?" asked Ralph.\r\n\r\n"Splendid manners--in the American style."\r\n\r\n"Would he be an agreeable member of our little circle?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he\'d care much about our little circle. He\'d concentrate\r\non Isabel."\r\n\r\n"And how would my cousin like that?"\r\n\r\n"Very possibly not at all. But it will be good for her. It will call\r\nback her thoughts."\r\n\r\n"Call them back--from where?"\r\n\r\n"From foreign parts and other unnatural places. Three months ago she\r\ngave Mr. Goodwood every reason to suppose he was acceptable to her, and\r\nit\'s not worthy of Isabel to go back on a real friend simply because she\r\nhas changed the scene. I\'ve changed the scene too, and the effect of it\r\nhas been to make me care more for my old associations than ever. It\'s my\r\nbelief that the sooner Isabel changes it back again the better. I know\r\nher well enough to know that she would never be truly happy over here,\r\nand I wish her to form some strong American tie that will act as a\r\npreservative."\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you perhaps a little too much in a hurry?" Ralph enquired.\r\n"Don\'t you think you ought to give her more of a chance in poor old\r\nEngland?"\r\n\r\n"A chance to ruin her bright young life? One\'s never too much in a hurry\r\nto save a precious human creature from drowning."\r\n\r\n"As I understand it then," said Ralph, "you wish me to push Mr. Goodwood\r\noverboard after her. Do you know," he added, "that I\'ve never heard her\r\nmention his name?"\r\n\r\nHenrietta gave a brilliant smile. "I\'m delighted to hear that; it proves\r\nhow much she thinks of him."\r\n\r\nRalph appeared to allow that there was a good deal in this, and he\r\nsurrendered to thought while his companion watched him askance. "If I\r\nshould invite Mr. Goodwood," he finally said, "it would be to quarrel\r\nwith him."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t do that; he\'d prove the better man."\r\n\r\n"You certainly are doing your best to make me hate him! I really don\'t\r\nthink I can ask him. I should be afraid of being rude to him."\r\n\r\n"It\'s just as you please," Henrietta returned. "I had no idea you were\r\nin love with her yourself."\r\n\r\n"Do you really believe that?" the young man asked with lifted eyebrows.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the most natural speech I\'ve ever heard you make! Of course I\r\nbelieve it," Miss Stackpole ingeniously said.\r\n\r\n"Well," Ralph concluded, "to prove to you that you\'re wrong I\'ll invite\r\nhim. It must be of course as a friend of yours."\r\n\r\n"It will not be as a friend of mine that he\'ll come; and it will not be\r\nto prove to me that I\'m wrong that you\'ll ask him--but to prove it to\r\nyourself!"\r\n\r\nThese last words of Miss Stackpole\'s (on which the two presently\r\nseparated) contained an amount of truth which Ralph Touchett was obliged\r\nto recognise; but it so far took the edge from too sharp a recognition\r\nthat, in spite of his suspecting it would be rather more indiscreet\r\nto keep than to break his promise, he wrote Mr. Goodwood a note of six\r\nlines, expressing the pleasure it would give Mr. Touchett the elder that\r\nhe should join a little party at Gardencourt, of which Miss Stackpole\r\nwas a valued member. Having sent his letter (to the care of a banker\r\nwhom Henrietta suggested) he waited in some suspense. He had heard this\r\nfresh formidable figure named for the first time; for when his mother\r\nhad mentioned on her arrival that there was a story about the girl\'s\r\nhaving an "admirer" at home, the idea had seemed deficient in reality\r\nand he had taken no pains to ask questions the answers to which would\r\ninvolve only the vague or the disagreeable. Now, however, the native\r\nadmiration of which his cousin was the object had become more concrete;\r\nit took the form of a young man who had followed her to London, who was\r\ninterested in a cotton-mill and had manners in the most splendid of the\r\nAmerican styles. Ralph had two theories about this intervenes. Either\r\nhis passion was a sentimental fiction of Miss Stackpole\'s (there was\r\nalways a sort of tacit understanding among women, born of the solidarity\r\nof the sex, that they should discover or invent lovers for each other),\r\nin which case he was not to be feared and would probably not accept the\r\ninvitation; or else he would accept the invitation and in this event\r\nprove himself a creature too irrational to demand further consideration.\r\nThe latter clause of Ralph\'s argument might have seemed incoherent;\r\nbut it embodied his conviction that if Mr. Goodwood were interested in\r\nIsabel in the serious manner described by Miss Stackpole he would not\r\ncare to present himself at Gardencourt on a summons from the latter\r\nlady. "On this supposition," said Ralph, "he must regard her as a thorn\r\non the stem of his rose; as an intercessor he must find her wanting in\r\ntact."\r\n\r\nTwo days after he had sent his invitation he received a very short\r\nnote from Caspar Goodwood, thanking him for it, regretting that other\r\nengagements made a visit to Gardencourt impossible and presenting many\r\ncompliments to Miss Stackpole. Ralph handed the note to Henrietta, who,\r\nwhen she had read it, exclaimed: "Well, I never have heard of anything\r\nso stiff!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid he doesn\'t care so much about my cousin as you suppose,"\r\nRalph observed.\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s not that; it\'s some subtler motive. His nature\'s very deep.\r\nBut I\'m determined to fathom it, and I shall write to him to know what\r\nhe means."\r\n\r\nHis refusal of Ralph\'s overtures was vaguely disconcerting; from the\r\nmoment he declined to come to Gardencourt our friend began to think\r\nhim of importance. He asked himself what it signified to him whether\r\nIsabel\'s admirers should be desperadoes or laggards; they were not\r\nrivals of his and were perfectly welcome to act out their genius.\r\nNevertheless he felt much curiosity as to the result of Miss Stackpole\'s\r\npromised enquiry into the causes of Mr. Goodwood\'s stiffness--a\r\ncuriosity for the present ungratified, inasmuch as when he asked her\r\nthree days later if she had written to London she was obliged to confess\r\nshe had written in vain. Mr. Goodwood had not replied.\r\n\r\n"I suppose he\'s thinking it over," she said; "he thinks everything\r\nover; he\'s not really at all impetuous. But I\'m accustomed to having my\r\nletters answered the same day." She presently proposed to Isabel, at\r\nall events, that they should make an excursion to London together. "If I\r\nmust tell the truth," she observed, "I\'m not seeing much at this\r\nplace, and I shouldn\'t think you were either. I\'ve not even seen that\r\naristocrat--what\'s his name?--Lord Washburton. He seems to let you\r\nseverely alone."\r\n\r\n"Lord Warburton\'s coming to-morrow, I happen to know," replied her\r\nfriend, who had received a note from the master of Lockleigh in answer\r\nto her own letter. "You\'ll have every opportunity of turning him inside\r\nout."\r\n\r\n"Well, he may do for one letter, but what\'s one letter when you want to\r\nwrite fifty? I\'ve described all the scenery in this vicinity and raved\r\nabout all the old women and donkeys. You may say what you please,\r\nscenery doesn\'t make a vital letter. I must go back to London and get\r\nsome impressions of real life. I was there but three days before I came\r\naway, and that\'s hardly time to get in touch."\r\n\r\nAs Isabel, on her journey from New York to Gardencourt, had seen even\r\nless of the British capital than this, it appeared a happy suggestion of\r\nHenrietta\'s that the two should go thither on a visit of pleasure. The\r\nidea struck Isabel as charming; she was curious of the thick detail of\r\nLondon, which had always loomed large and rich to her. They turned over\r\ntheir schemes together and indulged in visions of romantic hours. They\r\nwould stay at some picturesque old inn--one of the inns described by\r\nDickens--and drive over the town in those delightful hansoms. Henrietta\r\nwas a literary woman, and the great advantage of being a literary woman\r\nwas that you could go everywhere and do everything. They would dine at\r\na coffee-house and go afterwards to the play; they would frequent the\r\nAbbey and the British Museum and find out where Doctor Johnson had\r\nlived, and Goldsmith and Addison. Isabel grew eager and presently\r\nunveiled the bright vision to Ralph, who burst into a fit of laughter\r\nwhich scarce expressed the sympathy she had desired.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a delightful plan," he said. "I advise you to go to the Duke\'s\r\nHead in Covent Garden, an easy, informal, old-fashioned place, and I\'ll\r\nhave you put down at my club."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean it\'s improper?" Isabel asked. "Dear me, isn\'t anything\r\nproper here? With Henrietta surely I may go anywhere; she isn\'t hampered\r\nin that way. She has travelled over the whole American continent and can\r\nat least find her way about this minute island."\r\n\r\n"Ah then," said Ralph, "let me take advantage of her protection to go up\r\nto town as well. I may never have a chance to travel so safely!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nMiss Stackpole would have prepared to start immediately; but Isabel, as\r\nwe have seen, had been notified that Lord Warburton would come again to\r\nGardencourt, and she believed it her duty to remain there and see him.\r\nFor four or five days he had made no response to her letter; then he had\r\nwritten, very briefly, to say he would come to luncheon two days later.\r\nThere was something in these delays and postponements that touched the\r\ngirl and renewed her sense of his desire to be considerate and patient,\r\nnot to appear to urge her too grossly; a consideration the more studied\r\nthat she was so sure he "really liked" her. Isabel told her uncle she\r\nhad written to him, mentioning also his intention of coming; and the\r\nold man, in consequence, left his room earlier than usual and made his\r\nappearance at the two o\'clock repast. This was by no means an act of\r\nvigilance on his part, but the fruit of a benevolent belief that his\r\nbeing of the company might help to cover any conjoined straying away\r\nin case Isabel should give their noble visitor another hearing. That\r\npersonage drove over from Lockleigh and brought the elder of his sisters\r\nwith him, a measure presumably dictated by reflexions of the same order\r\nas Mr. Touchett\'s. The two visitors were introduced to Miss Stackpole,\r\nwho, at luncheon, occupied a seat adjoining Lord Warburton\'s. Isabel,\r\nwho was nervous and had no relish for the prospect of again arguing\r\nthe question he had so prematurely opened, could not help admiring his\r\ngood-humoured self-possession, which quite disguised the symptoms of\r\nthat preoccupation with her presence it was natural she should suppose\r\nhim to feel. He neither looked at her nor spoke to her, and the only\r\nsign of his emotion was that he avoided meeting her eyes. He had plenty\r\nof talk for the others, however, and he appeared to eat his luncheon\r\nwith discrimination and appetite. Miss Molyneux, who had a smooth,\r\nnun-like forehead and wore a large silver cross suspended from her neck,\r\nwas evidently preoccupied with Henrietta Stackpole, upon whom her\r\neyes constantly rested in a manner suggesting a conflict between deep\r\nalienation and yearning wonder. Of the two ladies from Lockleigh she\r\nwas the one Isabel had liked best; there was such a world of hereditary\r\nquiet in her. Isabel was sure moreover that her mild forehead and\r\nsilver cross referred to some weird Anglican mystery--some delightful\r\nreinstitution perhaps of the quaint office of the canoness. She wondered\r\nwhat Miss Molyneux would think of her if she knew Miss Archer had\r\nrefused her brother; and then she felt sure that Miss Molyneux would\r\nnever know--that Lord Warburton never told her such things. He was fond\r\nof her and kind to her, but on the whole he told her little. Such, at\r\nleast, was Isabel\'s theory; when, at table, she was not occupied in\r\nconversation she was usually occupied in forming theories about her\r\nneighbours. According to Isabel, if Miss Molyneux should ever learn what\r\nhad passed between Miss Archer and Lord Warburton she would probably be\r\nshocked at such a girl\'s failure to rise; or no, rather (this was our\r\nheroine\'s last position) she would impute to the young American but a\r\ndue consciousness of inequality.\r\n\r\nWhatever Isabel might have made of her opportunities, at all events,\r\nHenrietta Stackpole was by no means disposed to neglect those in which\r\nshe now found herself immersed. "Do you know you\'re the first lord I\'ve\r\never seen?" she said very promptly to her neighbour. "I suppose you\r\nthink I\'m awfully benighted."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve escaped seeing some very ugly men," Lord Warburton answered,\r\nlooking a trifle absently about the table.\r\n\r\n"Are they very ugly? They try to make us believe in America that they\'re\r\nall handsome and magnificent and that they wear wonderful robes and\r\ncrowns."\r\n\r\n"Ah, the robes and crowns are gone out of fashion," said Lord Warburton,\r\n"like your tomahawks and revolvers."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry for that; I think an aristocracy ought to be splendid,"\r\nHenrietta declared. "If it\'s not that, what is it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you know, it isn\'t much, at the best," her neighbour allowed.\r\n"Won\'t you have a potato?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care much for these European potatoes. I shouldn\'t know you\r\nfrom an ordinary American gentleman."\r\n\r\n"Do talk to me as if I were one," said Lord Warburton. "I don\'t see how\r\nyou manage to get on without potatoes; you must find so few things to\r\neat over here."\r\n\r\nHenrietta was silent a little; there was a chance he was not sincere.\r\n"I\'ve had hardly any appetite since I\'ve been here," she went on at\r\nlast; "so it doesn\'t much matter. I don\'t approve of you, you know; I\r\nfeel as if I ought to tell you that."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t approve of me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I don\'t suppose any one ever said such a thing to you before, did\r\nthey? I don\'t approve of lords as an institution. I think the world has\r\ngot beyond them--far beyond."\r\n\r\n"Oh, so do I. I don\'t approve of myself in the least. Sometimes it comes\r\nover me--how I should object to myself if I were not myself, don\'t you\r\nknow? But that\'s rather good, by the way--not to be vainglorious."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you give it up then?" Miss Stackpole enquired.\r\n\r\n"Give up--a--?" asked Lord Warburton, meeting her harsh inflexion with a\r\nvery mellow one.\r\n\r\n"Give up being a lord."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m so little of one! One would really forget all about it if you\r\nwretched Americans were not constantly reminding one. However, I do\r\nthink of giving it up, the little there is left of it, one of these\r\ndays."\r\n\r\n"I should like to see you do it!" Henrietta exclaimed rather grimly.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll invite you to the ceremony; we\'ll have a supper and a dance."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Miss Stackpole, "I like to see all sides. I don\'t approve\r\nof a privileged class, but I like to hear what they have to say for\r\nthemselves."\r\n\r\n"Mighty little, as you see!"\r\n\r\n"I should like to draw you out a little more," Henrietta continued. "But\r\nyou\'re always looking away. You\'re afraid of meeting my eye. I see you\r\nwant to escape me."\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m only looking for those despised potatoes."\r\n\r\n"Please explain about that young lady--your sister--then. I don\'t\r\nunderstand about her. Is she a Lady?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s a capital good girl."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like the way you say that--as if you wanted to change the\r\nsubject. Is her position inferior to yours?"\r\n\r\n"We neither of us have any position to speak of; but she\'s better off\r\nthan I, because she has none of the bother."\r\n\r\n"Yes, she doesn\'t look as if she had much bother. I wish I had as little\r\nbother as that. You do produce quiet people over here, whatever else you\r\nmay do."\r\n\r\n"Ah, you see one takes life easily, on the whole," said Lord Warburton.\r\n"And then you know we\'re very dull. Ah, we can be dull when we try!"\r\n\r\n"I should advise you to try something else. I shouldn\'t know what to\r\ntalk to your sister about; she looks so different. Is that silver cross\r\na badge?"\r\n\r\n"A badge?"\r\n\r\n"A sign of rank."\r\n\r\nLord Warburton\'s glance had wandered a good deal, but at this it met the\r\ngaze of his neighbour. "Oh yes," he answered in a moment; "the women go\r\nin for those things. The silver cross is worn by the eldest daughters of\r\nViscounts." Which was his harmless revenge for having occasionally had\r\nhis credulity too easily engaged in America. After luncheon he proposed\r\nto Isabel to come into the gallery and look at the pictures; and though\r\nshe knew he had seen the pictures twenty times she complied without\r\ncriticising this pretext. Her conscience now was very easy; ever since\r\nshe sent him her letter she had felt particularly light of spirit. He\r\nwalked slowly to the end of the gallery, staring at its contents and\r\nsaying nothing; and then he suddenly broke out: "I hoped you wouldn\'t\r\nwrite to me that way."\r\n\r\n"It was the only way, Lord Warburton," said the girl. "Do try and\r\nbelieve that."\r\n\r\n"If I could believe it of course I should let you alone. But we can\'t\r\nbelieve by willing it; and I confess I don\'t understand. I could\r\nunderstand your disliking me; that I could understand well. But that you\r\nshould admit you do--"\r\n\r\n"What have I admitted?" Isabel interrupted, turning slightly pale.\r\n\r\n"That you think me a good fellow; isn\'t that it?" She said nothing,\r\nand he went on: "You don\'t seem to have any reason, and that gives me a\r\nsense of injustice."\r\n\r\n"I have a reason, Lord Warburton." She said it in a tone that made his\r\nheart contract.\r\n\r\n"I should like very much to know it."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you some day when there\'s more to show for it."\r\n\r\n"Excuse my saying that in the mean time I must doubt of it."\r\n\r\n"You make me very unhappy," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not sorry for that; it may help you to know how I feel. Will you\r\nkindly answer me a question?" Isabel made no audible assent, but he\r\napparently saw in her eyes something that gave him courage to go on. "Do\r\nyou prefer some one else?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s a question I\'d rather not answer."\r\n\r\n"Ah, you do then!" her suitor murmured with bitterness.\r\n\r\nThe bitterness touched her, and she cried out: "You\'re mistaken! I\r\ndon\'t."\r\n\r\nHe sat down on a bench, unceremoniously, doggedly, like a man in\r\ntrouble; leaning his elbows on his knees and staring at the floor. "I\r\ncan\'t even be glad of that," he said at last, throwing himself back\r\nagainst the wall; "for that would be an excuse."\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyebrows in surprise. "An excuse? Must I excuse myself?"\r\n\r\nHe paid, however, no answer to the question. Another idea had come into\r\nhis head. "Is it my political opinions? Do you think I go too far?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t object to your political opinions, because I don\'t understand\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t care what I think!" he cried, getting up. "It\'s all the same\r\nto you."\r\n\r\nIsabel walked to the other side of the gallery and stood there showing\r\nhim her charming back, her light slim figure, the length of her white\r\nneck as she bent her head, and the density of her dark braids. She\r\nstopped in front of a small picture as if for the purpose of examining\r\nit; and there was something so young and free in her movement that her\r\nvery pliancy seemed to mock at him. Her eyes, however, saw nothing; they\r\nhad suddenly been suffused with tears. In a moment he followed her, and\r\nby this time she had brushed her tears away; but when she turned round\r\nher face was pale and the expression of her eyes strange. "That reason\r\nthat I wouldn\'t tell you--I\'ll tell it you after all. It\'s that I can\'t\r\nescape my fate."\r\n\r\n"Your fate?"\r\n\r\n"I should try to escape it if I were to marry you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand. Why should not that be your fate as well as\r\nanything else?"\r\n\r\n"Because it\'s not," said Isabel femininely. "I know it\'s not. It\'s not\r\nmy fate to give up--I know it can\'t be."\r\n\r\nPoor Lord Warburton stared, an interrogative point in either eye. "Do\r\nyou call marrying me giving up?"\r\n\r\n"Not in the usual sense. It\'s getting--getting--getting a great deal.\r\nBut it\'s giving up other chances."\r\n\r\n"Other chances for what?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean chances to marry," said Isabel, her colour quickly coming\r\nback to her. And then she stopped, looking down with a deep frown, as if\r\nit were hopeless to attempt to make her meaning clear.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it presumptuous in me to suggest that you\'ll gain more\r\nthan you\'ll lose," her companion observed.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t escape unhappiness," said Isabel. "In marrying you I shall be\r\ntrying to."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know whether you\'d try to, but you certainly would: that I must\r\nin candour admit!" he exclaimed with an anxious laugh.\r\n\r\n"I mustn\'t--I can\'t!" cried the girl.\r\n\r\n"Well, if you\'re bent on being miserable I don\'t see why you should make\r\nme so. Whatever charms a life of misery may have for you, it has none\r\nfor me."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not bent on a life of misery," said Isabel. "I\'ve always been\r\nintensely determined to be happy, and I\'ve often believed I should be.\r\nI\'ve told people that; you can ask them. But it comes over me every\r\nnow and then that I can never be happy in any extraordinary way; not by\r\nturning away, by separating myself."\r\n\r\n"By separating yourself from what?"\r\n\r\n"From life. From the usual chances and dangers, from what most people\r\nknow and suffer."\r\n\r\nLord Warburton broke into a smile that almost denoted hope. "Why,\r\nmy dear Miss Archer," he began to explain with the most considerate\r\neagerness, "I don\'t offer you any exoneration from life or from any\r\nchances or dangers whatever. I wish I could; depend upon it I would! For\r\nwhat do you take me, pray? Heaven help me, I\'m not the Emperor of China!\r\nAll I offer you is the chance of taking the common lot in a comfortable\r\nsort of way. The common lot? Why, I\'m devoted to the common lot! Strike\r\nan alliance with me, and I promise you that you shall have plenty of it.\r\nYou shall separate from nothing whatever--not even from your friend Miss\r\nStackpole."\r\n\r\n"She\'d never approve of it," said Isabel, trying to smile and take\r\nadvantage of this side-issue; despising herself too, not a little, for\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\n"Are we speaking of Miss Stackpole?" his lordship asked impatiently. "I\r\nnever saw a person judge things on such theoretic grounds."\r\n\r\n"Now I suppose you\'re speaking of me," said Isabel with humility; and\r\nshe turned away again, for she saw Miss Molyneux enter the gallery,\r\naccompanied by Henrietta and by Ralph.\r\n\r\nLord Warburton\'s sister addressed him with a certain timidity and\r\nreminded him she ought to return home in time for tea, as she was\r\nexpecting company to partake of it. He made no answer--apparently\r\nnot having heard her; he was preoccupied, and with good reason. Miss\r\nMolyneux--as if he had been Royalty--stood like a lady-in-waiting.\r\n\r\n"Well, I never, Miss Molyneux!" said Henrietta Stackpole. "If I wanted\r\nto go he\'d have to go. If I wanted my brother to do a thing he\'d have to\r\ndo it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Warburton does everything one wants," Miss Molyneux answered with\r\na quick, shy laugh. "How very many pictures you have!" she went on,\r\nturning to Ralph.\r\n\r\n"They look a good many, because they\'re all put together," said Ralph.\r\n"But it\'s really a bad way."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I think it\'s so nice. I wish we had a gallery at Lockleigh. I\'m so\r\nvery fond of pictures," Miss Molyneux went on, persistently, to Ralph,\r\nas if she were afraid Miss Stackpole would address her again. Henrietta\r\nappeared at once to fascinate and to frighten her.\r\n\r\n"Ah yes, pictures are very convenient," said Ralph, who appeared to know\r\nbetter what style of reflexion was acceptable to her.\r\n\r\n"They\'re so very pleasant when it rains," the young lady continued. "It\r\nhas rained of late so very often."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry you\'re going away, Lord Warburton," said Henrietta. "I wanted\r\nto get a great deal more out of you."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not going away," Lord Warburton answered.\r\n\r\n"Your sister says you must. In America the gentlemen obey the ladies."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid we have some people to tea," said Miss Molyneux, looking at\r\nher brother.\r\n\r\n"Very good, my dear. We\'ll go."\r\n\r\n"I hoped you would resist!" Henrietta exclaimed. "I wanted to see what\r\nMiss Molyneux would do."\r\n\r\n"I never do anything," said this young lady.\r\n\r\n"I suppose in your position it\'s sufficient for you to exist!" Miss\r\nStackpole returned. "I should like very much to see you at home."\r\n\r\n"You must come to Lockleigh again," said Miss Molyneux, very sweetly, to\r\nIsabel, ignoring this remark of Isabel\'s friend. Isabel looked into her\r\nquiet eyes a moment, and for that moment seemed to see in their grey\r\ndepths the reflexion of everything she had rejected in rejecting Lord\r\nWarburton--the peace, the kindness, the honour, the possessions, a deep\r\nsecurity and a great exclusion. She kissed Miss Molyneux and then she\r\nsaid: "I\'m afraid I can never come again."\r\n\r\n"Never again?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I\'m going away."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m so very sorry," said Miss Molyneux. "I think that\'s so very\r\nwrong of you."\r\n\r\nLord Warburton watched this little passage; then he turned away and\r\nstared at a picture. Ralph, leaning against the rail before the picture\r\nwith his hands in his pockets, had for the moment been watching him.\r\n\r\n"I should like to see you at home," said Henrietta, whom Lord Warburton\r\nfound beside him. "I should like an hour\'s talk with you; there are a\r\ngreat many questions I wish to ask you."\r\n\r\n"I shall be delighted to see you," the proprietor of Lockleigh answered;\r\n"but I\'m certain not to be able to answer many of your questions. When\r\nwill you come?"\r\n\r\n"Whenever Miss Archer will take me. We\'re thinking of going to London,\r\nbut we\'ll go and see you first. I\'m determined to get some satisfaction\r\nout of you."\r\n\r\n"If it depends upon Miss Archer I\'m afraid you won\'t get much. She won\'t\r\ncome to Lockleigh; she doesn\'t like the place."\r\n\r\n"She told me it was lovely!" said Henrietta.\r\n\r\nLord Warburton hesitated. "She won\'t come, all the same. You had better\r\ncome alone," he added.\r\n\r\nHenrietta straightened herself, and her large eyes expanded. "Would you\r\nmake that remark to an English lady?" she enquired with soft asperity.\r\n\r\nLord Warburton stared. "Yes, if I liked her enough."\r\n\r\n"You\'d be careful not to like her enough. If Miss Archer won\'t visit\r\nyour place again it\'s because she doesn\'t want to take me. I know what\r\nshe thinks of me, and I suppose you think the same--that I oughtn\'t to\r\nbring in individuals." Lord Warburton was at a loss; he had not been\r\nmade acquainted with Miss Stackpole\'s professional character and failed\r\nto catch her allusion. "Miss Archer has been warning you!" she therefore\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\n"Warning me?"\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t that why she came off alone with you here--to put you on your\r\nguard?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no," said Lord Warburton brazenly; "our talk had no such\r\nsolemn character as that."\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'ve been on your guard--intensely. I suppose it\'s natural\r\nto you; that\'s just what I wanted to observe. And so, too, Miss\r\nMolyneux--she wouldn\'t commit herself. You have been warned, anyway,"\r\nHenrietta continued, addressing this young lady; "but for you it wasn\'t\r\nnecessary."\r\n\r\n"I hope not," said Miss Molyneux vaguely.\r\n\r\n"Miss Stackpole takes notes," Ralph soothingly explained. "She\'s a great\r\nsatirist; she sees through us all and she works us up."\r\n\r\n"Well, I must say I never have had such a collection of bad material!"\r\nHenrietta declared, looking from Isabel to Lord Warburton and from this\r\nnobleman to his sister and to Ralph. "There\'s something the matter with\r\nyou all; you\'re as dismal as if you had got a bad cable."\r\n\r\n"You do see through us, Miss Stackpole," said Ralph in a low tone,\r\ngiving her a little intelligent nod as he led the party out of the\r\ngallery. "There\'s something the matter with us all."\r\n\r\nIsabel came behind these two; Miss Molyneux, who decidedly liked her\r\nimmensely, had taken her arm, to walk beside her over the polished\r\nfloor. Lord Warburton strolled on the other side with his hands behind\r\nhim and his eyes lowered. For some moments he said nothing; and then,\r\n"Is it true you\'re going to London?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I believe it has been arranged."\r\n\r\n"And when shall you come back?"\r\n\r\n"In a few days; but probably for a very short time. I\'m going to Paris\r\nwith my aunt."\r\n\r\n"When, then, shall I see you again?"\r\n\r\n"Not for a good while," said Isabel. "But some day or other, I hope."\r\n\r\n"Do you really hope it?"\r\n\r\n"Very much."\r\n\r\nHe went a few steps in silence; then he stopped and put out his hand.\r\n"Good-bye."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye," said Isabel.\r\n\r\nMiss Molyneux kissed her again, and she let the two depart. After it,\r\nwithout rejoining Henrietta and Ralph, she retreated to her own room; in\r\nwhich apartment, before dinner, she was found by Mrs. Touchett, who had\r\nstopped on her way to the salon. "I may as well tell you," said that\r\nlady, "that your uncle has informed me of your relations with Lord\r\nWarburton."\r\n\r\nIsabel considered. "Relations? They\'re hardly relations. That\'s the\r\nstrange part of it: he has seen me but three or four times."\r\n\r\n"Why did you tell your uncle rather than me?" Mrs. Touchett\r\ndispassionately asked.\r\n\r\nAgain the girl hesitated. "Because he knows Lord Warburton better."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I know you better."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not sure of that," said Isabel, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Neither am I, after all; especially when you give me that rather\r\nconceited look. One would think you were awfully pleased with yourself\r\nand had carried off a prize! I suppose that when you refuse an offer\r\nlike Lord Warburton\'s it\'s because you expect to do something better."\r\n\r\n"Ah, my uncle didn\'t say that!" cried Isabel, smiling still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nIt had been arranged that the two young ladies should proceed to London\r\nunder Ralph\'s escort, though Mrs. Touchett looked with little favour on\r\nthe plan. It was just the sort of plan, she said, that Miss Stackpole\r\nwould be sure to suggest, and she enquired if the correspondent of\r\nthe _Interviewer_ was to take the party to stay at her favourite\r\nboarding-house.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care where she takes us to stay, so long as there\'s local\r\ncolour," said Isabel. "That\'s what we\'re going to London for."\r\n\r\n"I suppose that after a girl has refused an English lord she may do\r\nanything," her aunt rejoined. "After that one needn\'t stand on trifles."\r\n\r\n"Should you have liked me to marry Lord Warburton?" Isabel enquired.\r\n\r\n"Of course I should."\r\n\r\n"I thought you disliked the English so much."\r\n\r\n"So I do; but it\'s all the greater reason for making use of them."\r\n\r\n"Is that your idea of marriage?" And Isabel ventured to add that her\r\naunt appeared to her to have made very little use of Mr. Touchett.\r\n\r\n"Your uncle\'s not an English nobleman," said Mrs. Touchett, "though even\r\nif he had been I should still probably have taken up my residence in\r\nFlorence."\r\n\r\n"Do you think Lord Warburton could make me any better than I am?" the\r\ngirl asked with some animation. "I don\'t mean I\'m too good to improve. I\r\nmean that I don\'t love Lord Warburton enough to marry him."\r\n\r\n"You did right to refuse him then," said Mrs. Touchett in her smallest,\r\nsparest voice. "Only, the next great offer you get, I hope you\'ll manage\r\nto come up to your standard."\r\n\r\n"We had better wait till the offer comes before we talk about it. I\r\nhope very much I may have no more offers for the present. They upset me\r\ncompletely."\r\n\r\n"You probably won\'t be troubled with them if you adopt permanently the\r\nBohemian manner of life. However, I\'ve promised Ralph not to criticise."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do whatever Ralph says is right," Isabel returned. "I\'ve unbounded\r\nconfidence in Ralph."\r\n\r\n"His mother\'s much obliged to you!" this lady dryly laughed.\r\n\r\n"It seems to me indeed she ought to feel it!" Isabel irrepressibly\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nRalph had assured her that there would be no violation of decency in\r\ntheir paying a visit--the little party of three--to the sights of the\r\nmetropolis; but Mrs. Touchett took a different view. Like many ladies of\r\nher country who had lived a long time in Europe, she had completely\r\nlost her native tact on such points, and in her reaction, not in itself\r\ndeplorable, against the liberty allowed to young persons beyond the\r\nseas, had fallen into gratuitous and exaggerated scruples. Ralph\r\naccompanied their visitors to town and established them at a quiet inn\r\nin a street that ran at right angles to Piccadilly. His first idea had\r\nbeen to take them to his father\'s house in Winchester Square, a large,\r\ndull mansion which at this period of the year was shrouded in silence\r\nand brown holland; but he bethought himself that, the cook being at\r\nGardencourt, there was no one in the house to get them their meals,\r\nand Pratt\'s Hotel accordingly became their resting-place. Ralph, on his\r\nside, found quarters in Winchester Square, having a "den" there of which\r\nhe was very fond and being familiar with deeper fears than that of a\r\ncold kitchen. He availed himself largely indeed of the resources of\r\nPratt\'s Hotel, beginning his day with an early visit to his fellow\r\ntravellers, who had Mr. Pratt in person, in a large bulging white\r\nwaistcoat, to remove their dish-covers. Ralph turned up, as he said,\r\nafter breakfast, and the little party made out a scheme of entertainment\r\nfor the day. As London wears in the month of September a face blank but\r\nfor its smears of prior service, the young man, who occasionally took\r\nan apologetic tone, was obliged to remind his companion, to Miss\r\nStackpole\'s high derision, that there wasn\'t a creature in town.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you mean the aristocracy are absent," Henrietta answered;\r\n"but I don\'t think you could have a better proof that if they were\r\nabsent altogether they wouldn\'t be missed. It seems to me the place is\r\nabout as full as it can be. There\'s no one here, of course, but three\r\nor four millions of people. What is it you call them--the lower-middle\r\nclass? They\'re only the population of London, and that\'s of no\r\nconsequence."\r\n\r\nRalph declared that for him the aristocracy left no void that Miss\r\nStackpole herself didn\'t fill, and that a more contented man was nowhere\r\nat that moment to be found. In this he spoke the truth, for the stale\r\nSeptember days, in the huge half-empty town, had a charm wrapped in them\r\nas a coloured gem might be wrapped in a dusty cloth. When he went home\r\nat night to the empty house in Winchester Square, after a chain of hours\r\nwith his comparatively ardent friends, he wandered into the big dusky\r\ndining-room, where the candle he took from the hall-table, after letting\r\nhimself in, constituted the only illumination. The square was still, the\r\nhouse was still; when he raised one of the windows of the dining-room to\r\nlet in the air he heard the slow creak of the boots of a lone constable.\r\nHis own step, in the empty place, seemed loud and sonorous; some of the\r\ncarpets had been raised, and whenever he moved he roused a melancholy\r\necho. He sat down in one of the armchairs; the big dark dining table\r\ntwinkled here and there in the small candle-light; the pictures on the\r\nwall, all of them very brown, looked vague and incoherent. There was a\r\nghostly presence as of dinners long since digested, of table-talk\r\nthat had lost its actuality. This hint of the supernatural perhaps had\r\nsomething to do with the fact that his imagination took a flight and\r\nthat he remained in his chair a long time beyond the hour at which he\r\nshould have been in bed; doing nothing, not even reading the evening\r\npaper. I say he did nothing, and I maintain the phrase in the face of\r\nthe fact that he thought at these moments of Isabel. To think of Isabel\r\ncould only be for him an idle pursuit, leading to nothing and profiting\r\nlittle to any one. His cousin had not yet seemed to him so charming\r\nas during these days spent in sounding, tourist-fashion, the deeps\r\nand shallows of the metropolitan element. Isabel was full of premises,\r\nconclusions, emotions; if she had come in search of local colour she\r\nfound it everywhere. She asked more questions than he could answer, and\r\nlaunched brave theories, as to historic cause and social effect, that he\r\nwas equally unable to accept or to refute. The party went more than once\r\nto the British Museum and to that brighter palace of art which reclaims\r\nfor antique variety so large an area of a monotonous suburb; they spent\r\na morning in the Abbey and went on a penny-steamer to the Tower; they\r\nlooked at pictures both in public and private collections and sat\r\non various occasions beneath the great trees in Kensington Gardens.\r\nHenrietta proved an indestructible sight-seer and a more lenient judge\r\nthan Ralph had ventured to hope. She had indeed many disappointments,\r\nand London at large suffered from her vivid remembrance of the strong\r\npoints of the American civic idea; but she made the best of its dingy\r\ndignities and only heaved an occasional sigh and uttered a desultory\r\n"Well!" which led no further and lost itself in retrospect. The truth\r\nwas that, as she said herself, she was not in her element. "I\'ve not a\r\nsympathy with inanimate objects," she remarked to Isabel at the National\r\nGallery; and she continued to suffer from the meagreness of the glimpse\r\nthat had as yet been vouchsafed to her of the inner life. Landscapes\r\nby Turner and Assyrian bulls were a poor substitute for the literary\r\ndinner-parties at which she had hoped to meet the genius and renown of\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\n"Where are your public men, where are your men and women of intellect?"\r\nshe enquired of Ralph, standing in the middle of Trafalgar Square as\r\nif she had supposed this to be a place where she would naturally meet a\r\nfew. "That\'s one of them on the top of the column, you say--Lord Nelson.\r\nWas he a lord too? Wasn\'t he high enough, that they had to stick him a\r\nhundred feet in the air? That\'s the past--I don\'t care about the past; I\r\nwant to see some of the leading minds of the present. I won\'t say of the\r\nfuture, because I don\'t believe much in your future." Poor Ralph had few\r\nleading minds among his acquaintance and rarely enjoyed the pleasure\r\nof buttonholing a celebrity; a state of things which appeared to Miss\r\nStackpole to indicate a deplorable want of enterprise. "If I were on the\r\nother side I should call," she said, "and tell the gentleman, whoever\r\nhe might be, that I had heard a great deal about him and had come to see\r\nfor myself. But I gather from what you say that this is not the custom\r\nhere. You seem to have plenty of meaningless customs, but none of those\r\nthat would help along. We are in advance, certainly. I suppose I shall\r\nhave to give up the social side altogether;" and Henrietta, though\r\nshe went about with her guidebook and pencil and wrote a letter to the\r\n_Interviewer_ about the Tower (in which she described the execution of\r\nLady Jane Grey), had a sad sense of falling below her mission.\r\n\r\nThe incident that had preceded Isabel\'s departure from Gardencourt left\r\na painful trace in our young woman\'s mind: when she felt again in her\r\nface, as from a recurrent wave, the cold breath of her last suitor\'s\r\nsurprise, she could only muffle her head till the air cleared. She could\r\nnot have done less than what she did; this was certainly true. But her\r\nnecessity, all the same, had been as graceless as some physical act in\r\na strained attitude, and she felt no desire to take credit for her\r\nconduct. Mixed with this imperfect pride, nevertheless, was a feeling of\r\nfreedom which in itself was sweet and which, as she wandered through the\r\ngreat city with her ill-matched companions, occasionally throbbed into\r\nodd demonstrations. When she walked in Kensington Gardens she stopped\r\nthe children (mainly of the poorer sort) whom she saw playing on the\r\ngrass; she asked them their names and gave them sixpence and, when\r\nthey were pretty, kissed them. Ralph noticed these quaint charities;\r\nhe noticed everything she did. One afternoon, that his companions might\r\npass the time, he invited them to tea in Winchester Square, and he had\r\nthe house set in order as much as possible for their visit. There\r\nwas another guest to meet them, an amiable bachelor, an old friend of\r\nRalph\'s who happened to be in town and for whom prompt commerce with\r\nMiss Stackpole appeared to have neither difficulty nor dread. Mr.\r\nBantling, a stout, sleek, smiling man of forty, wonderfully dressed,\r\nuniversally informed and incoherently amused, laughed immoderately at\r\neverything Henrietta said, gave her several cups of tea, examined in her\r\nsociety the _bric-\xe0-brac_, of which Ralph had a considerable collection,\r\nand afterwards, when the host proposed they should go out into the\r\nsquare and pretend it was a _f\xeate-champetre_, walked round the limited\r\nenclosure several times with her and, at a dozen turns of their talk,\r\nbounded responsive--as with a positive passion for argument--to her\r\nremarks upon the inner life.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I see; I dare say you found it very quiet at Gardencourt. Naturally\r\nthere\'s not much going on there when there\'s such a lot of illness\r\nabout. Touchett\'s very bad, you know; the doctors have forbidden his\r\nbeing in England at all, and he has only come back to take care of his\r\nfather. The old man, I believe, has half a dozen things the matter\r\nwith him. They call it gout, but to my certain knowledge he has organic\r\ndisease so developed that you may depend upon it he\'ll go, some day\r\nsoon, quite quickly. Of course that sort of thing makes a dreadfully\r\ndull house; I wonder they have people when they can do so little for\r\nthem. Then I believe Mr. Touchett\'s always squabbling with his wife; she\r\nlives away from her husband, you know, in that extraordinary American\r\nway of yours. If you want a house where there\'s always something going\r\non, I recommend you to go down and stay with my sister, Lady Pensil,\r\nin Bedfordshire. I\'ll write to her to-morrow and I\'m sure she\'ll be\r\ndelighted to ask you. I know just what you want--you want a house\r\nwhere they go in for theatricals and picnics and that sort of thing. My\r\nsister\'s just that sort of woman; she\'s always getting up something or\r\nother and she\'s always glad to have the sort of people who help her. I\'m\r\nsure she\'ll ask you down by return of post: she\'s tremendously fond of\r\ndistinguished people and writers. She writes herself, you know; but\r\nI haven\'t read everything she has written. It\'s usually poetry, and I\r\ndon\'t go in much for poetry--unless it\'s Byron. I suppose you think a\r\ngreat deal of Byron in America," Mr. Bantling continued, expanding\r\nin the stimulating air of Miss Stackpole\'s attention, bringing up his\r\nsequences promptly and changing his topic with an easy turn of hand.\r\nYet he none the less gracefully kept in sight of the idea, dazzling to\r\nHenrietta, of her going to stay with Lady Pensil in Bedfordshire. "I\r\nunderstand what you want; you want to see some genuine English sport.\r\nThe Touchetts aren\'t English at all, you know; they have their own\r\nhabits, their own language, their own food--some odd religion even, I\r\nbelieve, of their own. The old man thinks it\'s wicked to hunt, I\'m told.\r\nYou must get down to my sister\'s in time for the theatricals, and I\'m\r\nsure she\'ll be glad to give you a part. I\'m sure you act well; I know\r\nyou\'re very clever. My sister\'s forty years old and has seven children,\r\nbut she\'s going to play the principal part. Plain as she is she makes up\r\nawfully well--I will say for her. Of course you needn\'t act if you don\'t\r\nwant to."\r\n\r\nIn this manner Mr. Bantling delivered himself while they strolled over\r\nthe grass in Winchester Square, which, although it had been peppered\r\nby the London soot, invited the tread to linger. Henrietta thought her\r\nblooming, easy-voiced bachelor, with his impressibility to feminine\r\nmerit and his splendid range of suggestion, a very agreeable man, and\r\nshe valued the opportunity he offered her. "I don\'t know but I would go,\r\nif your sister should ask me. I think it would be my duty. What do you\r\ncall her name?"\r\n\r\n"Pensil. It\'s an odd name, but it isn\'t a bad one."\r\n\r\n"I think one name\'s as good as another. But what\'s her rank?".\r\n\r\n"Oh, she\'s a baron\'s wife; a convenient sort of rank. You\'re fine enough\r\nand you\'re not too fine."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know but what she\'d be too fine for me. What do you call the\r\nplace she lives in--Bedfordshire?"\r\n\r\n"She lives away in the northern corner of it. It\'s a tiresome country,\r\nbut I dare say you won\'t mind it. I\'ll try and run down while you\'re\r\nthere."\r\n\r\nAll this was very pleasant to Miss Stackpole, and she was sorry to be\r\nobliged to separate from Lady Pensil\'s obliging brother. But it happened\r\nthat she had met the day before, in Piccadilly, some friends whom she\r\nhad not seen for a year: the Miss Climbers, two ladies from Wilmington,\r\nDelaware, who had been travelling on the Continent and were now\r\npreparing to re-embark. Henrietta had had a long interview with them on\r\nthe Piccadilly pavement, and though the three ladies all talked at once\r\nthey had not exhausted their store. It had been agreed therefore that\r\nHenrietta should come and dine with them in their lodgings in Jermyn\r\nStreet at six o\'clock on the morrow, and she now bethought herself of\r\nthis engagement. She prepared to start for Jermyn Street, taking leave\r\nfirst of Ralph Touchett and Isabel, who, seated on garden chairs\r\nin another part of the enclosure, were occupied--if the term may be\r\nused--with an exchange of amenities less pointed than the practical\r\ncolloquy of Miss Stackpole and Mr. Bantling. When it had been settled\r\nbetween Isabel and her friend that they should be reunited at some\r\nreputable hour at Pratt\'s Hotel, Ralph remarked that the latter must\r\nhave a cab. She couldn\'t walk all the way to Jermyn Street.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you mean it\'s improper for me to walk alone!" Henrietta\r\nexclaimed. "Merciful powers, have I come to this?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s not the slightest need of your walking alone," Mr. Bantling\r\ngaily interposed. "I should be greatly pleased to go with you."\r\n\r\n"I simply meant that you\'d be late for dinner," Ralph returned. "Those\r\npoor ladies may easily believe that we refuse, at the last, to spare\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"You had better have a hansom, Henrietta," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll get you a hansom if you\'ll trust me," Mr. Bantling went on.\r\n\r\n"We might walk a little till we meet one."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why I shouldn\'t trust him, do you?" Henrietta enquired of\r\nIsabel.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see what Mr. Bantling could do to you," Isabel obligingly\r\nanswered; "but, if you like, we\'ll walk with you till you find your\r\ncab."\r\n\r\n"Never mind; we\'ll go alone. Come on, Mr. Bantling, and take care you\r\nget me a good one."\r\n\r\nMr. Bantling promised to do his best, and the two took their departure,\r\nleaving the girl and her cousin together in the square, over which\r\na clear September twilight had now begun to gather. It was perfectly\r\nstill; the wide quadrangle of dusky houses showed lights in none of the\r\nwindows, where the shutters and blinds were closed; the pavements were\r\na vacant expanse, and, putting aside two small children from a\r\nneighbouring slum, who, attracted by symptoms of abnormal animation\r\nin the interior, poked their faces between the rusty rails of\r\nthe enclosure, the most vivid object within sight was the big red\r\npillar-post on the southeast corner.\r\n\r\n"Henrietta will ask him to get into the cab and go with her to Jermyn\r\nStreet," Ralph observed. He always spoke of Miss Stackpole as Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"Very possibly," said his companion.\r\n\r\n"Or rather, no, she won\'t," he went on. "But Bantling will ask leave to\r\nget in."\r\n\r\n"Very likely again. I am very glad they are such good friends."\r\n\r\n"She has made a conquest. He thinks her a brilliant woman. It may go\r\nfar," said Ralph.\r\n\r\nIsabel was briefly silent. "I call Henrietta a very brilliant woman, but\r\nI don\'t think it will go far. They would never really know each other.\r\nHe has not the least idea what she really is, and she has no just\r\ncomprehension of Mr. Bantling."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no more usual basis of union than a mutual misunderstanding.\r\nBut it ought not to be so difficult to understand Bob Bantling," Ralph\r\nadded. "He is a very simple organism."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but Henrietta\'s a simpler one still. And, pray, what am I to do?"\r\nIsabel asked, looking about her through the fading light, in which the\r\nlimited landscape-gardening of the square took on a large and effective\r\nappearance. "I don\'t imagine that you\'ll propose that you and I, for our\r\namusement, shall drive about London in a hansom."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no reason we shouldn\'t stay here--if you don\'t dislike it. It\'s\r\nvery warm; there will be half an hour yet before dark; and if you permit\r\nit I\'ll light a cigarette."\r\n\r\n"You may do what you please," said Isabel, "if you\'ll amuse me till\r\nseven o\'clock. I propose at that hour to go back and partake of a simple\r\nand solitary repast--two poached eggs and a muffin--at Pratt\'s Hotel."\r\n\r\n"Mayn\'t I dine with you?" Ralph asked.\r\n\r\n"No, you\'ll dine at your club."\r\n\r\nThey had wandered back to their chairs in the centre of the square\r\nagain, and Ralph had lighted his cigarette. It would have given him\r\nextreme pleasure to be present in person at the modest little feast she\r\nhad sketched; but in default of this he liked even being forbidden. For\r\nthe moment, however, he liked immensely being alone with her, in the\r\nthickening dusk, in the centre of the multitudinous town; it made her\r\nseem to depend upon him and to be in his power. This power he could\r\nexert but vaguely; the best exercise of it was to accept her decisions\r\nsubmissively which indeed there was already an emotion in doing. "Why\r\nwon\'t you let me dine with you?" he demanded after a pause.\r\n\r\n"Because I don\'t care for it."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you\'re tired of me."\r\n\r\n"I shall be an hour hence. You see I have the gift of foreknowledge."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I shall be delightful meanwhile," said Ralph.\r\n\r\nBut he said nothing more, and as she made no rejoinder they sat\r\nsome time in a stillness which seemed to contradict his promise of\r\nentertainment. It seemed to him she was preoccupied, and he wondered\r\nwhat she was thinking about; there were two or three very possible\r\nsubjects. At last he spoke again. "Is your objection to my society this\r\nevening caused by your expectation of another visitor?"\r\n\r\nShe turned her head with a glance of her clear, fair eyes. "Another\r\nvisitor? What visitor should I have?"\r\n\r\nHe had none to suggest; which made his question seem to himself silly as\r\nwell as brutal. "You\'ve a great many friends that I don\'t know. You\'ve a\r\nwhole past from which I was perversely excluded."\r\n\r\n"You were reserved for my future. You must remember that my past is over\r\nthere across the water. There\'s none of it here in London."\r\n\r\n"Very good, then, since your future is seated beside you. Capital thing\r\nto have your future so handy." And Ralph lighted another cigarette and\r\nreflected that Isabel probably meant she had received news that Mr.\r\nCaspar Goodwood had crossed to Paris. After he had lighted his cigarette\r\nhe puffed it a while, and then he resumed. "I promised just now to be\r\nvery amusing; but you see I don\'t come up to the mark, and the fact is\r\nthere\'s a good deal of temerity in one\'s undertaking to amuse a\r\nperson like you. What do you care for my feeble attempts? You\'ve grand\r\nideas--you\'ve a high standard in such matters. I ought at least to bring\r\nin a band of music or a company of mountebanks."\r\n\r\n"One mountebank\'s enough, and you do very well. Pray go on, and in\r\nanother ten minutes I shall begin to laugh."\r\n\r\n"I assure you I\'m very serious," said Ralph. "You do really ask a great\r\ndeal."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you mean. I ask nothing."\r\n\r\n"You accept nothing," said Ralph. She coloured, and now suddenly it\r\nseemed to her that she guessed his meaning. But why should he speak\r\nto her of such things? He hesitated a little and then he continued:\r\n"There\'s something I should like very much to say to you. It\'s a\r\nquestion I wish to ask. It seems to me I\'ve a right to ask it, because\r\nI\'ve a kind of interest in the answer."\r\n\r\n"Ask what you will," Isabel replied gently, "and I\'ll try to satisfy\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Well then, I hope you won\'t mind my saying that Warburton has told me\r\nof something that has passed between you."\r\n\r\nIsabel suppressed a start; she sat looking at her open fan. "Very good;\r\nI suppose it was natural he should tell you."\r\n\r\n"I have his leave to let you know he has done so. He has some hope\r\nstill," said Ralph.\r\n\r\n"Still?"\r\n\r\n"He had it a few days ago."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe he has any now," said the girl.\r\n\r\n"I\'m very sorry for him then; he\'s such an honest man."\r\n\r\n"Pray, did he ask you to talk to me?"\r\n\r\n"No, not that. But he told me because he couldn\'t help it. We\'re old\r\nfriends, and he was greatly disappointed. He sent me a line asking me\r\nto come and see him, and I drove over to Lockleigh the day before he and\r\nhis sister lunched with us. He was very heavy-hearted; he had just got a\r\nletter from you."\r\n\r\n"Did he show you the letter?" asked Isabel with momentary loftiness.\r\n\r\n"By no means. But he told me it was a neat refusal. I was very sorry for\r\nhim," Ralph repeated.\r\n\r\nFor some moments Isabel said nothing; then at last, "Do you know how\r\noften he had seen me?" she enquired. "Five or six times."\r\n\r\n"That\'s to your glory."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not for that I say it."\r\n\r\n"What then do you say it for. Not to prove that poor Warburton\'s state\r\nof mind\'s superficial, because I\'m pretty sure you don\'t think that."\r\n\r\nIsabel certainly was unable to say she thought it; but presently she\r\nsaid something else. "If you\'ve not been requested by Lord Warburton to\r\nargue with me, then you\'re doing it disinterestedly--or for the love of\r\nargument."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no wish to argue with you at all. I only wish to leave you alone.\r\nI\'m simply greatly interested in your own sentiments."\r\n\r\n"I\'m greatly obliged to you!" cried Isabel with a slightly nervous\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n"Of course you mean that I\'m meddling in what doesn\'t concern me. But\r\nwhy shouldn\'t I speak to you of this matter without annoying you or\r\nembarrassing myself? What\'s the use of being your cousin if I can\'t have\r\na few privileges? What\'s the use of adoring you without hope of a reward\r\nif I can\'t have a few compensations? What\'s the use of being ill and\r\ndisabled and restricted to mere spectatorship at the game of life if I\r\nreally can\'t see the show when I\'ve paid so much for my ticket? Tell me\r\nthis," Ralph went on while she listened to him with quickened attention.\r\n"What had you in mind when you refused Lord Warburton?"\r\n\r\n"What had I in mind?"\r\n\r\n"What was the logic--the view of your situation--that dictated so\r\nremarkable an act?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t wish to marry him--if that\'s logic."\r\n\r\n"No, that\'s not logic--and I knew that before. It\'s really nothing, you\r\nknow. What was it you said to yourself? You certainly said more than\r\nthat."\r\n\r\nIsabel reflected a moment, then answered with a question of her own.\r\n"Why do you call it a remarkable act? That\'s what your mother thinks\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\n"Warburton\'s such a thorough good sort; as a man, I consider he has\r\nhardly a fault. And then he\'s what they call here no end of a swell. He\r\nhas immense possessions, and his wife would be thought a superior being.\r\nHe unites the intrinsic and the extrinsic advantages."\r\n\r\nIsabel watched her cousin as to see how far he would go. "I refused him\r\nbecause he was too perfect then. I\'m not perfect myself, and he\'s too\r\ngood for me. Besides, his perfection would irritate me."\r\n\r\n"That\'s ingenious rather than candid," said Ralph. "As a fact you think\r\nnothing in the world too perfect for you."\r\n\r\n"Do you think I\'m so good?"\r\n\r\n"No, but you\'re exacting, all the same, without the excuse of thinking\r\nyourself good. Nineteen women out of twenty, however, even of the most\r\nexacting sort, would have managed to do with Warburton. Perhaps you\r\ndon\'t know how he has been stalked."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t wish to know. But it seems to me," said Isabel, "that one day\r\nwhen we talked of him you mentioned odd things in him." Ralph smokingly\r\nconsidered. "I hope that what I said then had no weight with you;\r\nfor they were not faults, the things I spoke of: they were simply\r\npeculiarities of his position. If I had known he wished to marry you I\'d\r\nnever have alluded to them. I think I said that as regards that position\r\nhe was rather a sceptic. It would have been in your power to make him a\r\nbeliever."\r\n\r\n"I think not. I don\'t understand the matter, and I\'m not conscious of\r\nany mission of that sort. You\'re evidently disappointed," Isabel added,\r\nlooking at her cousin with rueful gentleness. "You\'d have liked me to\r\nmake such a marriage."\r\n\r\n"Not in the least. I\'m absolutely without a wish on the subject. I don\'t\r\npretend to advise you, and I content myself with watching you--with the\r\ndeepest interest."\r\n\r\nShe gave rather a conscious sigh. "I wish I could be as interesting to\r\nmyself as I am to you!"\r\n\r\n"There you\'re not candid again; you\'re extremely interesting to\r\nyourself. Do you know, however," said Ralph, "that if you\'ve really\r\ngiven Warburton his final answer I\'m rather glad it has been what it\r\nwas. I don\'t mean I\'m glad for you, and still less of course for him.\r\nI\'m glad for myself."\r\n\r\n"Are you thinking of proposing to me?"\r\n\r\n"By no means. From the point of view I speak of that would be fatal;\r\nI should kill the goose that supplies me with the material of my\r\ninimitable _omelettes_. I use that animal as the symbol of my insane\r\nillusions. What I mean is that I shall have the thrill of seeing what a\r\nyoung lady does who won\'t marry Lord Warburton."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what your mother counts upon too," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"Ah, there will be plenty of spectators! We shall hang on the rest of\r\nyour career. I shall not see all of it, but I shall probably see the\r\nmost interesting years. Of course if you were to marry our friend you\'d\r\nstill have a career--a very decent, in fact a very brilliant one. But\r\nrelatively speaking it would be a little prosaic. It would be definitely\r\nmarked out in advance; it would be wanting in the unexpected. You know\r\nI\'m extremely fond of the unexpected, and now that you\'ve kept the game\r\nin your hands I depend on your giving us some grand example of it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand you very well," said Isabel, "but I do so well\r\nenough to be able to say that if you look for grand examples of anything\r\nfrom me I shall disappoint you."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll do so only by disappointing yourself and that will go hard with\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\nTo this she made no direct reply; there was an amount of truth in it\r\nthat would bear consideration. At last she said abruptly: "I don\'t see\r\nwhat harm there is in my wishing not to tie myself. I don\'t want to\r\nbegin life by marrying. There are other things a woman can do."\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing she can do so well. But you\'re of course so\r\nmany-sided."\r\n\r\n"If one\'s two-sided it\'s enough," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"You\'re the most charming of polygons!" her companion broke out. At a\r\nglance from his companion, however, he became grave, and to prove it\r\nwent on: "You want to see life--you\'ll be hanged if you don\'t, as the\r\nyoung men say."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I want to see it as the young men want to see it. But I\r\ndo want to look about me."\r\n\r\n"You want to drain the cup of experience."\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t wish to touch the cup of experience. It\'s a poisoned drink!\r\nI only want to see for myself."\r\n\r\n"You want to see, but not to feel," Ralph remarked.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that if one\'s a sentient being one can make the\r\ndistinction. I\'m a good deal like Henrietta. The other day when I asked\r\nher if she wished to marry she said: \'Not till I\'ve seen Europe!\' I too\r\ndon\'t wish to marry till I\'ve seen Europe."\r\n\r\n"You evidently expect a crowned head will be struck with you."\r\n\r\n"No, that would be worse than marrying Lord Warburton. But it\'s getting\r\nvery dark," Isabel continued, "and I must go home." She rose from her\r\nplace, but Ralph only sat still and looked at her. As he remained there\r\nshe stopped, and they exchanged a gaze that was full on either side, but\r\nespecially on Ralph\'s, of utterances too vague for words.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve answered my question," he said at last. "You\'ve told me what I\r\nwanted. I\'m greatly obliged to you."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me I\'ve told you very little."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve told me the great thing: that the world interests you and that\r\nyou want to throw yourself into it."\r\n\r\nHer silvery eyes shone a moment in the dusk. "I never said that."\r\n\r\n"I think you meant it. Don\'t repudiate it. It\'s so fine!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you\'re trying to fasten upon me, for I\'m not in the\r\nleast an adventurous spirit. Women are not like men."\r\n\r\nRalph slowly rose from his seat and they walked together to the gate of\r\nthe square. "No," he said; "women rarely boast of their courage. Men do\r\nso with a certain frequency."\r\n\r\n"Men have it to boast of!"\r\n\r\n"Women have it too. You\'ve a great deal."\r\n\r\n"Enough to go home in a cab to Pratt\'s Hotel, but not more."\r\n\r\nRalph unlocked the gate, and after they had passed out he fastened it.\r\n"We\'ll find your cab," he said; and as they turned toward a neighbouring\r\nstreet in which this quest might avail he asked her again if he mightn\'t\r\nsee her safely to the inn.\r\n\r\n"By no means," she answered; "you\'re very tired; you must go home and go\r\nto bed."\r\n\r\nThe cab was found, and he helped her into it, standing a moment at the\r\ndoor. "When people forget I\'m a poor creature I\'m often incommoded," he\r\nsaid. "But it\'s worse when they remember it!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nShe had had no hidden motive in wishing him not to take her home; it\r\nsimply struck her that for some days past she had consumed an inordinate\r\nquantity of his time, and the independent spirit of the American girl\r\nwhom extravagance of aid places in an attitude that she ends by finding\r\n"affected" had made her decide that for these few hours she must suffice\r\nto herself. She had moreover a great fondness for intervals of solitude,\r\nwhich since her arrival in England had been but meagrely met. It was a\r\nluxury she could always command at home and she had wittingly missed\r\nit. That evening, however, an incident occurred which--had there been a\r\ncritic to note it--would have taken all colour from the theory that the\r\nwish to be quite by herself had caused her to dispense with her cousin\'s\r\nattendance. Seated toward nine o\'clock in the dim illumination of\r\nPratt\'s Hotel and trying with the aid of two tall candles to lose\r\nherself in a volume she had brought from Gardencourt, she succeeded\r\nonly to the extent of reading other words than those printed on the\r\npage--words that Ralph had spoken to her that afternoon. Suddenly\r\nthe well-muffed knuckle of the waiter was applied to the door, which\r\npresently gave way to his exhibition, even as a glorious trophy, of the\r\ncard of a visitor. When this memento had offered to her fixed sight the\r\nname of Mr. Caspar Goodwood she let the man stand before her without\r\nsignifying her wishes.\r\n\r\n"Shall I show the gentleman up, ma\'am?" he asked with a slightly\r\nencouraging inflexion.\r\n\r\nIsabel hesitated still and while she hesitated glanced at the mirror.\r\n"He may come in," she said at last; and waited for him not so much\r\nsmoothing her hair as girding her spirit.\r\n\r\nCaspar Goodwood was accordingly the next moment shaking hands with her,\r\nbut saying nothing till the servant had left the room. "Why didn\'t you\r\nanswer my letter?" he then asked in a quick, full, slightly peremptory\r\ntone--the tone of a man whose questions were habitually pointed and who\r\nwas capable of much insistence.\r\n\r\nShe answered by a ready question, "How did you know I was here?"\r\n\r\n"Miss Stackpole let me know," said Caspar Goodwood. "She told me you\r\nwould probably be at home alone this evening and would be willing to see\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Where did she see you--to tell you that?"\r\n\r\n"She didn\'t see me; she wrote to me."\r\n\r\nIsabel was silent; neither had sat down; they stood there with an air\r\nof defiance, or at least of contention. "Henrietta never told me she was\r\nwriting to you," she said at last. "This is not kind of her."\r\n\r\n"Is it so disagreeable to you to see me?" asked the young man.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t expect it. I don\'t like such surprises."\r\n\r\n"But you knew I was in town; it was natural we should meet."\r\n\r\n"Do you call this meeting? I hoped I shouldn\'t see you. In so big a\r\nplace as London it seemed very possible."\r\n\r\n"It was apparently repugnant to you even to write to me," her visitor\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\nIsabel made no reply; the sense of Henrietta Stackpole\'s treachery,\r\nas she momentarily qualified it, was strong within her. "Henrietta\'s\r\ncertainly not a model of all the delicacies!" she exclaimed with\r\nbitterness. "It was a great liberty to take."\r\n\r\n"I suppose I\'m not a model either--of those virtues or of any others.\r\nThe fault\'s mine as much as hers."\r\n\r\nAs Isabel looked at him it seemed to her that his jaw had never been\r\nmore square. This might have displeased her, but she took a different\r\nturn. "No, it\'s not your fault so much as hers. What you\'ve done was\r\ninevitable, I suppose, for you."\r\n\r\n"It was indeed!" cried Caspar Goodwood with a voluntary laugh.\r\n\r\n"And now that I\'ve come, at any rate, mayn\'t I stay?"\r\n\r\n"You may sit down, certainly."\r\n\r\nShe went back to her chair again, while her visitor took the first place\r\nthat offered, in the manner of a man accustomed to pay little thought to\r\nthat sort of furtherance. "I\'ve been hoping every day for an answer to\r\nmy letter. You might have written me a few lines."\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t the trouble of writing that prevented me; I could as easily\r\nhave written you four pages as one. But my silence was an intention,"\r\nIsabel said. "I thought it the best thing."\r\n\r\nHe sat with his eyes fixed on hers while she spoke; then he lowered them\r\nand attached them to a spot in the carpet as if he were making a strong\r\neffort to say nothing but what he ought. He was a strong man in the\r\nwrong, and he was acute enough to see that an uncompromising exhibition\r\nof his strength would only throw the falsity of his position into\r\nrelief. Isabel was not incapable of tasting any advantage of position\r\nover a person of this quality, and though little desirous to flaunt it\r\nin his face she could enjoy being able to say "You know you oughtn\'t to\r\nhave written to me yourself!" and to say it with an air of triumph.\r\n\r\nCaspar Goodwood raised his eyes to her own again; they seemed to shine\r\nthrough the vizard of a helmet. He had a strong sense of justice and was\r\nready any day in the year--over and above this--to argue the question\r\nof his rights. "You said you hoped never to hear from me again; I know\r\nthat. But I never accepted any such rule as my own. I warned you that\r\nyou should hear very soon."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t say I hoped _never_ to hear from you," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"Not for five years then; for ten years; twenty years. It\'s the same\r\nthing."\r\n\r\n"Do you find it so? It seems to me there\'s a great difference. I can\r\nimagine that at the end of ten years we might have a very pleasant\r\ncorrespondence. I shall have matured my epistolary style."\r\n\r\nShe looked away while she spoke these words, knowing them of so much\r\nless earnest a cast than the countenance of her listener. Her eyes,\r\nhowever, at last came back to him, just as he said very irrelevantly;\r\n"Are you enjoying your visit to your uncle?"\r\n\r\n"Very much indeed." She dropped, but then she broke out. "What good do\r\nyou expect to get by insisting?"\r\n\r\n"The good of not losing you."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve no right to talk of losing what\'s not yours. And even from your\r\nown point of view," Isabel added, "you ought to know when to let one\r\nalone."\r\n\r\n"I disgust you very much," said Caspar Goodwood gloomily; not as if to\r\nprovoke her to compassion for a man conscious of this blighting fact,\r\nbut as if to set it well before himself, so that he might endeavour to\r\nact with his eyes on it.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you don\'t at all delight me, you don\'t fit in, not in any way,\r\njust now, and the worst is that your putting it to the proof in this\r\nmanner is quite unnecessary." It wasn\'t certainly as if his nature had\r\nbeen soft, so that pin-pricks would draw blood from it; and from the\r\nfirst of her acquaintance with him, and of her having to defend herself\r\nagainst a certain air that he had of knowing better what was good for\r\nher than she knew herself, she had recognised the fact that perfect\r\nfrankness was her best weapon. To attempt to spare his sensibility or to\r\nescape from him edgewise, as one might do from a man who had barred\r\nthe way less sturdily--this, in dealing with Caspar Goodwood, who would\r\ngrasp at everything of every sort that one might give him, was wasted\r\nagility. It was not that he had not susceptibilities, but his passive\r\nsurface, as well as his active, was large and hard, and he might always\r\nbe trusted to dress his wounds, so far as they required it, himself. She\r\ncame back, even for her measure of possible pangs and aches in him,\r\nto her old sense that he was naturally plated and steeled, armed\r\nessentially for aggression.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t reconcile myself to that," he simply said. There was a\r\ndangerous liberality about it; for she felt how open it was to him to\r\nmake the point that he had not always disgusted her.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t reconcile myself to it either, and it\'s not the state of things\r\nthat ought to exist between us. If you\'d only try to banish me from your\r\nmind for a few months we should be on good terms again."\r\n\r\n"I see. If I should cease to think of you at all for a prescribed time,\r\nI should find I could keep it up indefinitely."\r\n\r\n"Indefinitely is more than I ask. It\'s more even than I should like."\r\n\r\n"You know that what you ask is impossible," said the young man, taking\r\nhis adjective for granted in a manner she found irritating.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you capable of making a calculated effort?" she demanded.\r\n"You\'re strong for everything else; why shouldn\'t you be strong for\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\n"An effort calculated for what?" And then as she hung fire, "I\'m\r\ncapable of nothing with regard to you," he went on, "but just of being\r\ninfernally in love with you. If one\'s strong one loves only the more\r\nstrongly."\r\n\r\n"There\'s a good deal in that;" and indeed our young lady felt the\r\nforce of it--felt it thrown off, into the vast of truth and poetry,\r\nas practically a bait to her imagination. But she promptly came round.\r\n"Think of me or not, as you find most possible; only leave me alone."\r\n\r\n"Until when?"\r\n\r\n"Well, for a year or two."\r\n\r\n"Which do you mean? Between one year and two there\'s all the difference\r\nin the world."\r\n\r\n"Call it two then," said Isabel with a studied effect of eagerness.\r\n\r\n"And what shall I gain by that?" her friend asked with no sign of\r\nwincing.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have obliged me greatly."\r\n\r\n"And what will be my reward?"\r\n\r\n"Do you need a reward for an act of generosity?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, when it involves a great sacrifice."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no generosity without some sacrifice. Men don\'t understand such\r\nthings. If you make the sacrifice you\'ll have all my admiration."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care a cent for your admiration--not one straw, with nothing to\r\nshow for it. When will you marry me? That\'s the only question."\r\n\r\n"Never--if you go on making me feel only as I feel at present."\r\n\r\n"What do I gain then by not trying to make you feel otherwise?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll gain quite as much as by worrying me to death!" Caspar Goodwood\r\nbent his eyes again and gazed a while into the crown of his hat. A\r\ndeep flush overspread his face; she could see her sharpness had at last\r\npenetrated. This immediately had a value--classic, romantic, redeeming,\r\nwhat did she know? for her; "the strong man in pain" was one of the\r\ncategories of the human appeal, little charm as he might exert in the\r\ngiven case. "Why do you make me say such things to you?" she cried in a\r\ntrembling voice. "I only want to be gentle--to be thoroughly kind. It\'s\r\nnot delightful to me to feel people care for me and yet to have to try\r\nand reason them out of it. I think others also ought to be considerate;\r\nwe have each to judge for ourselves. I know you\'re considerate, as much\r\nas you can be; you\'ve good reasons for what you do. But I really don\'t\r\nwant to marry, or to talk about it at all now. I shall probably never\r\ndo it--no, never. I\'ve a perfect right to feel that way, and it\'s no\r\nkindness to a woman to press her so hard, to urge her against her will.\r\nIf I give you pain I can only say I\'m very sorry. It\'s not my fault; I\r\ncan\'t marry you simply to please you. I won\'t say that I shall always\r\nremain your friend, because when women say that, in these situations, it\r\npasses, I believe, for a sort of mockery. But try me some day."\r\n\r\nCaspar Goodwood, during this speech, had kept his eyes fixed upon the\r\nname of his hatter, and it was not until some time after she had ceased\r\nspeaking that he raised them. When he did so the sight of a rosy, lovely\r\neagerness in Isabel\'s face threw some confusion into his attempt to\r\nanalyse her words. "I\'ll go home--I\'ll go to-morrow--I\'ll leave you\r\nalone," he brought out at last. "Only," he heavily said, "I hate to lose\r\nsight of you!"\r\n\r\n"Never fear. I shall do no harm."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll marry some one else, as sure as I sit here," Caspar Goodwood\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\n"Do you think that a generous charge?"\r\n\r\n"Why not? Plenty of men will try to make you."\r\n\r\n"I told you just now that I don\'t wish to marry and that I almost\r\ncertainly never shall."\r\n\r\n"I know you did, and I like your \'almost certainly\'! I put no faith in\r\nwhat you say."\r\n\r\n"Thank you very much. Do you accuse me of lying to shake you off? You\r\nsay very delicate things."\r\n\r\n"Why should I not say that? You\'ve given me no pledge of anything at\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"No, that\'s all that would be wanting!"\r\n\r\n"You may perhaps even believe you\'re safe--from wishing to be. But\r\nyou\'re not," the young man went on as if preparing himself for the\r\nworst.\r\n\r\n"Very well then. We\'ll put it that I\'m not safe. Have it as you please."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, however," said Caspar Goodwood, "that my keeping you in\r\nsight would prevent it."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you indeed? I\'m after all very much afraid of you. Do you think\r\nI\'m so very easily pleased?" she asked suddenly, changing her tone.\r\n\r\n"No--I don\'t; I shall try to console myself with that. But there are a\r\ncertain number of very dazzling men in the world, no doubt; and if there\r\nwere only one it would be enough. The most dazzling of all will make\r\nstraight for you. You\'ll be sure to take no one who isn\'t dazzling."\r\n\r\n"If you mean by dazzling brilliantly clever," Isabel said--"and I can\'t\r\nimagine what else you mean--I don\'t need the aid of a clever man to\r\nteach me how to live. I can find it out for myself."\r\n\r\n"Find out how to live alone? I wish that, when you have, you\'d teach\r\nme!"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him a moment; then with a quick smile, "Oh, you ought to\r\nmarry!" she said.\r\n\r\nHe might be pardoned if for an instant this exclamation seemed to him\r\nto sound the infernal note, and it is not on record that her motive for\r\ndischarging such a shaft had been of the clearest. He oughtn\'t to stride\r\nabout lean and hungry, however--she certainly felt _that_ for him. "God\r\nforgive you!" he murmured between his teeth as he turned away.\r\n\r\nHer accent had put her slightly in the wrong, and after a moment she\r\nfelt the need to right herself. The easiest way to do it was to place\r\nhim where she had been. "You do me great injustice--you say what you\r\ndon\'t know!" she broke out. "I shouldn\'t be an easy victim--I\'ve proved\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Oh, to me, perfectly."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve proved it to others as well." And she paused a moment. "I refused\r\na proposal of marriage last week; what they call--no doubt--a dazzling\r\none."\r\n\r\n"I\'m very glad to hear it," said the young man gravely.\r\n\r\n"It was a proposal many girls would have accepted; it had everything to\r\nrecommend it." Isabel had not proposed to herself to tell this story,\r\nbut, now she had begun, the satisfaction of speaking it out and doing\r\nherself justice took possession of her. "I was offered a great position\r\nand a great fortune--by a person whom I like extremely."\r\n\r\nCaspar watched her with intense interest. "Is he an Englishman?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s an English nobleman," said Isabel.\r\n\r\nHer visitor received this announcement at first in silence, but at last\r\nsaid: "I\'m glad he\'s disappointed."\r\n\r\n"Well then, as you have companions in misfortune, make the best of it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t call him a companion," said Casper grimly.\r\n\r\n"Why not--since I declined his offer absolutely?"\r\n\r\n"That doesn\'t make him my companion. Besides, he\'s an Englishman."\r\n\r\n"And pray isn\'t an Englishman a human being?" Isabel asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, those people? They\'re not of my humanity, and I don\'t care what\r\nbecomes of them."\r\n\r\n"You\'re very angry," said the girl. "We\'ve discussed this matter quite\r\nenough."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I\'m very angry. I plead guilty to that!"\r\n\r\nShe turned away from him, walked to the open window and stood a moment\r\nlooking into the dusky void of the street, where a turbid gaslight\r\nalone represented social animation. For some time neither of these young\r\npersons spoke; Caspar lingered near the chimney-piece with eyes gloomily\r\nattached. She had virtually requested him to go--he knew that; but at\r\nthe risk of making himself odious he kept his ground. She was far too\r\ndear to him to be easily renounced, and he had crossed the sea all to\r\nwring from her some scrap of a vow. Presently she left the window and\r\nstood again before him. "You do me very little justice--after my telling\r\nyou what I told you just now. I\'m sorry I told you--since it matters so\r\nlittle to you."\r\n\r\n"Ah," cried the young man, "if you were thinking of _me_ when you did it!"\r\nAnd then he paused with the fear that she might contradict so happy a\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n"I was thinking of you a little," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"A little? I don\'t understand. If the knowledge of what I feel for you\r\nhad any weight with you at all, calling it a \'little\' is a poor account\r\nof it."\r\n\r\nIsabel shook her head as if to carry off a blunder. "I\'ve refused a most\r\nkind, noble gentleman. Make the most of that."\r\n\r\n"I thank you then," said Caspar Goodwood gravely. "I thank you\r\nimmensely."\r\n\r\n"And now you had better go home."\r\n\r\n"May I not see you again?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I think it\'s better not. You\'ll be sure to talk of this, and you see it\r\nleads to nothing."\r\n\r\n"I promise you not to say a word that will annoy you."\r\n\r\nIsabel reflected and then answered: "I return in a day or two to my\r\nuncle\'s, and I can\'t propose to you to come there. It would be too\r\ninconsistent."\r\n\r\nCaspar Goodwood, on his side, considered. "You must do me justice too.\r\nI received an invitation to your uncle\'s more than a week ago, and I\r\ndeclined it."\r\n\r\nShe betrayed surprise. "From whom was your invitation?"\r\n\r\n"From Mr. Ralph Touchett, whom I suppose to be your cousin. I declined\r\nit because I had not your authorisation to accept it. The suggestion\r\nthat Mr. Touchett should invite me appeared to have come from Miss\r\nStackpole."\r\n\r\n"It certainly never did from me. Henrietta really goes very far," Isabel\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be too hard on her--that touches _me_."\r\n\r\n"No; if you declined you did quite right, and I thank you for it." And\r\nshe gave a little shudder of dismay at the thought that Lord Warburton\r\nand Mr. Goodwood might have met at Gardencourt: it would have been so\r\nawkward for Lord Warburton.\r\n\r\n"When you leave your uncle where do you go?" her companion asked.\r\n\r\n"I go abroad with my aunt--to Florence and other places."\r\n\r\nThe serenity of this announcement struck a chill to the young man\'s\r\nheart; he seemed to see her whirled away into circles from which he was\r\ninexorably excluded. Nevertheless he went on quickly with his questions.\r\n"And when shall you come back to America?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not for a long time. I\'m very happy here."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to give up your country?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be an infant!"\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'ll be out of my sight indeed!" said Caspar Goodwood.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," she answered rather grandly. "The world--with all these\r\nplaces so arranged and so touching each other--comes to strike one as\r\nrather small."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a sight too big for _me_!" Caspar exclaimed with a simplicity\r\nour young lady might have found touching if her face had not been set\r\nagainst concessions.\r\n\r\nThis attitude was part of a system, a theory, that she had lately\r\nembraced, and to be thorough she said after a moment: "Don\'t think me\r\nunkind if I say it\'s just _that_--being out of your sight--that I like.\r\nIf you were in the same place I should feel you were watching me, and I\r\ndon\'t like that--I like my liberty too much. If there\'s a thing in the\r\nworld I\'m fond of," she went on with a slight recurrence of grandeur,\r\n"it\'s my personal independence."\r\n\r\nBut whatever there might be of the too superior in this speech moved\r\nCaspar Goodwood\'s admiration; there was nothing he winced at in the\r\nlarge air of it. He had never supposed she hadn\'t wings and the need of\r\nbeautiful free movements--he wasn\'t, with his own long arms and strides,\r\nafraid of any force in her. Isabel\'s words, if they had been meant to\r\nshock him, failed of the mark and only made him smile with the sense\r\nthat here was common ground. "Who would wish less to curtail your\r\nliberty than I? What can give me greater pleasure than to see you\r\nperfectly independent--doing whatever you like? It\'s to make you\r\nindependent that I want to marry you."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a beautiful sophism," said the girl with a smile more beautiful\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n"An unmarried woman--a girl of your age--isn\'t independent. There are\r\nall sorts of things she can\'t do. She\'s hampered at every step."\r\n\r\n"That\'s as she looks at the question," Isabel answered with much spirit.\r\n"I\'m not in my first youth--I can do what I choose--I belong quite to\r\nthe independent class. I\'ve neither father nor mother; I\'m poor and of\r\na serious disposition; I\'m not pretty. I therefore am not bound to be\r\ntimid and conventional; indeed I can\'t afford such luxuries. Besides,\r\nI try to judge things for myself; to judge wrong, I think, is more\r\nhonourable than not to judge at all. I don\'t wish to be a mere sheep in\r\nthe flock; I wish to choose my fate and know something of human affairs\r\nbeyond what other people think it compatible with propriety to tell me."\r\nShe paused a moment, but not long enough for her companion to reply. He\r\nwas apparently on the point of doing so when she went on: "Let me say\r\nthis to you, Mr. Goodwood. You\'re so kind as to speak of being afraid of\r\nmy marrying. If you should hear a rumour that I\'m on the point of doing\r\nso--girls are liable to have such things said about them--remember what\r\nI have told you about my love of liberty and venture to doubt it."\r\n\r\nThere was something passionately positive in the tone in which she gave\r\nhim this advice, and he saw a shining candour in her eyes that helped\r\nhim to believe her. On the whole he felt reassured, and you might have\r\nperceived it by the manner in which he said, quite eagerly: "You want\r\nsimply to travel for two years? I\'m quite willing to wait two years, and\r\nyou may do what you like in the interval. If that\'s all you want,\r\npray say so. I don\'t want you to be conventional; do I strike you as\r\nconventional myself? Do you want to improve your mind? Your mind\'s quite\r\ngood enough for me; but if it interests you to wander about a while and\r\nsee different countries I shall be delighted to help you in any way in\r\nmy power."\r\n\r\n"You\'re very generous; that\'s nothing new to me. The best way to help me\r\nwill be to put as many hundred miles of sea between us as possible."\r\n\r\n"One would think you were going to commit some atrocity!" said Caspar\r\nGoodwood.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I am. I wish to be free even to do that if the fancy takes me."\r\n\r\n"Well then," he said slowly, "I\'ll go home." And he put out his hand,\r\ntrying to look contented and confident.\r\n\r\nIsabel\'s confidence in him, however, was greater than any he could feel\r\nin her. Not that he thought her capable of committing an atrocity; but,\r\nturn it over as he would, there was something ominous in the way she\r\nreserved her option. As she took his hand she felt a great respect for\r\nhim; she knew how much he cared for her and she thought him magnanimous.\r\nThey stood so for a moment, looking at each other, united by a\r\nhand-clasp which was not merely passive on her side. "That\'s right,"\r\nshe said very kindly, almost tenderly. "You\'ll lose nothing by being a\r\nreasonable man."\r\n\r\n"But I\'ll come back, wherever you are, two years hence," he returned\r\nwith characteristic grimness.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that our young lady was inconsequent, and at this she\r\nsuddenly changed her note. "Ah, remember, I promise nothing--absolutely\r\nnothing!" Then more softly, as if to help him to leave her: "And\r\nremember too that I shall not be an easy victim!"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll get very sick of your independence."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I shall; it\'s even very probable. When that day comes I shall\r\nbe very glad to see you."\r\n\r\nShe had laid her hand on the knob of the door that led into her room,\r\nand she waited a moment to see whether her visitor would not take his\r\ndeparture. But he appeared unable to move; there was still an immense\r\nunwillingness in his attitude and a sore remonstrance in his eyes. "I\r\nmust leave you now," said Isabel; and she opened the door and passed\r\ninto the other room.\r\n\r\nThis apartment was dark, but the darkness was tempered by a vague\r\nradiance sent up through the window from the court of the hotel, and\r\nIsabel could make out the masses of the furniture, the dim shining of\r\nthe mirror and the looming of the big four-posted bed. She stood still a\r\nmoment, listening, and at last she heard Caspar Goodwood walk out of\r\nthe sitting-room and close the door behind him. She stood still a little\r\nlonger, and then, by an irresistible impulse, dropped on her knees\r\nbefore her bed and hid her face in her arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nShe was not praying; she was trembling--trembling all over. Vibration\r\nwas easy to her, was in fact too constant with her, and she found\r\nherself now humming like a smitten harp. She only asked, however, to put\r\non the cover, to case herself again in brown holland, but she wished to\r\nresist her excitement, and the attitude of devotion, which she kept for\r\nsome time, seemed to help her to be still. She intensely rejoiced that\r\nCaspar Goodwood was gone; there was something in having thus got rid of\r\nhim that was like the payment, for a stamped receipt, of some debt\r\ntoo long on her mind. As she felt the glad relief she bowed her head a\r\nlittle lower; the sense was there, throbbing in her heart; it was part\r\nof her emotion, but it was a thing to be ashamed of--it was profane and\r\nout of place. It was not for some ten minutes that she rose from her\r\nknees, and even when she came back to the sitting-room her tremor had\r\nnot quite subsided. It had had, verily, two causes: part of it was to be\r\naccounted for by her long discussion with Mr. Goodwood, but it might be\r\nfeared that the rest was simply the enjoyment she found in the exercise\r\nof her power. She sat down in the same chair again and took up her book,\r\nbut without going through the form of opening the volume. She leaned\r\nback, with that low, soft, aspiring murmur with which she often\r\nuttered her response to accidents of which the brighter side was not\r\nsuperficially obvious, and yielded to the satisfaction of having refused\r\ntwo ardent suitors in a fortnight. That love of liberty of which she\r\nhad given Caspar Goodwood so bold a sketch was as yet almost exclusively\r\ntheoretic; she had not been able to indulge it on a large scale. But it\r\nappeared to her she had done something; she had tasted of the delight,\r\nif not of battle, at least of victory; she had done what was truest to\r\nher plan. In the glow of this consciousness the image of Mr. Goodwood\r\ntaking his sad walk homeward through the dingy town presented itself\r\nwith a certain reproachful force; so that, as at the same moment the\r\ndoor of the room was opened, she rose with an apprehension that he\r\nhad come back. But it was only Henrietta Stackpole returning from her\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nMiss Stackpole immediately saw that our young lady had been "through"\r\nsomething, and indeed the discovery demanded no great penetration. She\r\nwent straight up to her friend, who received her without a greeting.\r\nIsabel\'s elation in having sent Caspar Goodwood back to America\r\npresupposed her being in a manner glad he had come to see her; but at\r\nthe same time she perfectly remembered Henrietta had had no right to set\r\na trap for her. "Has he been here, dear?" the latter yearningly asked.\r\n\r\nIsabel turned away and for some moments answered nothing. "You acted\r\nvery wrongly," she declared at last.\r\n\r\n"I acted for the best. I only hope you acted as well."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not the judge. I can\'t trust you," said Isabel.\r\n\r\nThis declaration was unflattering, but Henrietta was much too unselfish\r\nto heed the charge it conveyed; she cared only for what it intimated\r\nwith regard to her friend. "Isabel Archer," she observed with equal\r\nabruptness and solemnity, "if you marry one of these people I\'ll never\r\nspeak to you again!"\r\n\r\n"Before making so terrible a threat you had better wait till I\'m asked,"\r\nIsabel replied. Never having said a word to Miss Stackpole about Lord\r\nWarburton\'s overtures, she had now no impulse whatever to justify\r\nherself to Henrietta by telling her that she had refused that nobleman.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'ll be asked quick enough, once you get off on the Continent.\r\nAnnie Climber was asked three times in Italy--poor plain little Annie."\r\n\r\n"Well, if Annie Climber wasn\'t captured why should I be?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe Annie was pressed; but you\'ll be."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a flattering conviction," said Isabel without alarm.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t flatter you, Isabel, I tell you the truth!" cried her friend.\r\n"I hope you don\'t mean to tell me that you didn\'t give Mr. Goodwood some\r\nhope."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why I should tell you anything; as I said to you just now,\r\nI can\'t trust you. But since you\'re so much interested in Mr. Goodwood I\r\nwon\'t conceal from you that he returns immediately to America."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say you\'ve sent him off?" Henrietta almost shrieked.\r\n\r\n"I asked him to leave me alone; and I ask you the same, Henrietta." Miss\r\nStackpole glittered for an instant with dismay, and then passed to the\r\nmirror over the chimney-piece and took off her bonnet. "I hope you\'ve\r\nenjoyed your dinner," Isabel went on.\r\n\r\nBut her companion was not to be diverted by frivolous propositions. "Do\r\nyou know where you\'re going, Isabel Archer?"\r\n\r\n"Just now I\'m going to bed," said Isabel with persistent frivolity.\r\n\r\n"Do you know where you\'re drifting?" Henrietta pursued, holding out her\r\nbonnet delicately.\r\n\r\n"No, I haven\'t the least idea, and I find it very pleasant not to know.\r\nA swift carriage, of a dark night, rattling with four horses over roads\r\nthat one can\'t see--that\'s my idea of happiness."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Goodwood certainly didn\'t teach you to say such things as\r\nthat--like the heroine of an immoral novel," said Miss Stackpole.\r\n"You\'re drifting to some great mistake."\r\n\r\nIsabel was irritated by her friend\'s interference, yet she still tried\r\nto think what truth this declaration could represent. She could think\r\nof nothing that diverted her from saying: "You must be very fond of me,\r\nHenrietta, to be willing to be so aggressive."\r\n\r\n"I love you intensely, Isabel," said Miss Stackpole with feeling.\r\n\r\n"Well, if you love me intensely let me as intensely alone. I asked that\r\nof Mr. Goodwood, and I must also ask it of you."\r\n\r\n"Take care you\'re not let alone too much."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what Mr. Goodwood said to me. I told him I must take the risks."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a creature of risks--you make me shudder!" cried Henrietta.\r\n"When does Mr. Goodwood return to America?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know--he didn\'t tell me."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you didn\'t enquire," said Henrietta with the note of righteous\r\nirony.\r\n\r\n"I gave him too little satisfaction to have the right to ask questions\r\nof him."\r\n\r\nThis assertion seemed to Miss Stackpole for a moment to bid defiance to\r\ncomment; but at last she exclaimed: "Well, Isabel, if I didn\'t know you\r\nI might think you were heartless!"\r\n\r\n"Take care," said Isabel; "you\'re spoiling me."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I\'ve done that already. I hope, at least," Miss Stackpole\r\nadded, "that he may cross with Annie Climber!"\r\n\r\nIsabel learned from her the next morning that she had determined not to\r\nreturn to Gardencourt (where old Mr. Touchett had promised her a renewed\r\nwelcome), but to await in London the arrival of the invitation that Mr.\r\nBantling had promised her from his sister Lady Pensil. Miss Stackpole\r\nrelated very freely her conversation with Ralph Touchett\'s sociable\r\nfriend and declared to Isabel that she really believed she had now got\r\nhold of something that would lead to something. On the receipt of Lady\r\nPensil\'s letter--Mr. Bantling had virtually guaranteed the arrival of\r\nthis document--she would immediately depart for Bedfordshire, and if\r\nIsabel cared to look out for her impressions in the _Interviewer_\r\nshe would certainly find them. Henrietta was evidently going to see\r\nsomething of the inner life this time.\r\n\r\n"Do you know where you\'re drifting, Henrietta Stackpole?" Isabel asked,\r\nimitating the tone in which her friend had spoken the night before.\r\n\r\n"I\'m drifting to a big position--that of the Queen of American\r\nJournalism. If my next letter isn\'t copied all over the West I\'ll\r\nswallow my penwiper!"\r\n\r\nShe had arranged with her friend Miss Annie Climber, the young lady\r\nof the continental offers, that they should go together to make\r\nthose purchases which were to constitute Miss Climber\'s farewell to a\r\nhemisphere in which she at least had been appreciated; and she presently\r\nrepaired to Jermyn Street to pick up her companion. Shortly after her\r\ndeparture Ralph Touchett was announced, and as soon as he came in Isabel\r\nsaw he had something on his mind. He very soon took his cousin into his\r\nconfidence. He had received from his mother a telegram to the effect\r\nthat his father had had a sharp attack of his old malady, that she\r\nwas much alarmed and that she begged he would instantly return to\r\nGardencourt. On this occasion at least Mrs. Touchett\'s devotion to the\r\nelectric wire was not open to criticism.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve judged it best to see the great doctor, Sir Matthew Hope,\r\nfirst," Ralph said; "by great good luck he\'s in town. He\'s to see me\r\nat half-past twelve, and I shall make sure of his coming down to\r\nGardencourt--which he will do the more readily as he has already seen\r\nmy father several times, both there and in London. There\'s an express\r\nat two-forty-five, which I shall take; and you\'ll come back with me or\r\nremain here a few days longer, exactly as you prefer."\r\n\r\n"I shall certainly go with you," Isabel returned. "I don\'t suppose I can\r\nbe of any use to my uncle, but if he\'s ill I shall like to be near him."\r\n\r\n"I think you\'re fond of him," said Ralph with a certain shy pleasure\r\nin his face. "You appreciate him, which all the world hasn\'t done. The\r\nquality\'s too fine."\r\n\r\n"I quite adore him," Isabel after a moment said.\r\n\r\n"That\'s very well. After his son he\'s your greatest admirer." She\r\nwelcomed this assurance, but she gave secretly a small sigh of relief\r\nat the thought that Mr. Touchett was one of those admirers who couldn\'t\r\npropose to marry her. This, however, was not what she spoke; she went on\r\nto inform Ralph that there were other reasons for her not remaining in\r\nLondon. She was tired of it and wished to leave it; and then Henrietta\r\nwas going away--going to stay in Bedfordshire.\r\n\r\n"In Bedfordshire?"\r\n\r\n"With Lady Pensil, the sister of Mr. Bantling, who has answered for an\r\ninvitation."\r\n\r\nRalph was feeling anxious, but at this he broke into a laugh. Suddenly,\r\nnone the less, his gravity returned. "Bantling\'s a man of courage. But\r\nif the invitation should get lost on the way?"\r\n\r\n"I thought the British post-office was impeccable."\r\n\r\n"The good Homer sometimes nods," said Ralph. "However," he went on more\r\nbrightly, "the good Bantling never does, and, whatever happens, he\'ll\r\ntake care of Henrietta."\r\n\r\nRalph went to keep his appointment with Sir Matthew Hope, and Isabel\r\nmade her arrangements for quitting Pratt\'s Hotel. Her uncle\'s danger\r\ntouched her nearly, and while she stood before her open trunk, looking\r\nabout her vaguely for what she should put into it, the tears suddenly\r\nrose to her eyes. It was perhaps for this reason that when Ralph came\r\nback at two o\'clock to take her to the station she was not yet ready. He\r\nfound Miss Stackpole, however, in the sitting-room, where she had just\r\nrisen from her luncheon, and this lady immediately expressed her regret\r\nat his father\'s illness.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a grand old man," she said; "he\'s faithful to the last. If it\'s\r\nreally to be the last--pardon my alluding to it, but you must often\r\nhave thought of the possibility--I\'m sorry that I shall not be at\r\nGardencourt."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll amuse yourself much more in Bedfordshire."\r\n\r\n"I shall be sorry to amuse myself at such a time," said Henrietta\r\nwith much propriety. But she immediately added: "I should like so to\r\ncommemorate the closing scene."\r\n\r\n"My father may live a long time," said Ralph simply. Then, adverting\r\nto topics more cheerful, he interrogated Miss Stackpole as to her own\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nNow that Ralph was in trouble she addressed him in a tone of larger\r\nallowance and told him that she was much indebted to him for having made\r\nher acquainted with Mr. Bantling. "He has told me just the things I\r\nwant to know," she said; "all the society items and all about the royal\r\nfamily. I can\'t make out that what he tells me about the royal family is\r\nmuch to their credit; but he says that\'s only my peculiar way of looking\r\nat it. Well, all I want is that he should give me the facts; I can put\r\nthem together quick enough, once I\'ve got them." And she added that Mr.\r\nBantling had been so good as to promise to come and take her out that\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n"To take you where?" Ralph ventured to enquire.\r\n\r\n"To Buckingham Palace. He\'s going to show me over it, so that I may get\r\nsome idea how they live."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Ralph, "we leave you in good hands. The first thing we shall\r\nhear is that you\'re invited to Windsor Castle."\r\n\r\n"If they ask me, I shall certainly go. Once I get started I\'m not\r\nafraid. But for all that," Henrietta added in a moment, "I\'m not\r\nsatisfied; I\'m not at peace about Isabel."\r\n\r\n"What is her last misdemeanour?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ve told you before, and I suppose there\'s no harm in my going\r\non. I always finish a subject that I take up. Mr. Goodwood was here last\r\nnight."\r\n\r\nRalph opened his eyes; he even blushed a little--his blush being\r\nthe sign of an emotion somewhat acute. He remembered that Isabel, in\r\nseparating from him in Winchester Square, had repudiated his suggestion\r\nthat her motive in doing so was the expectation of a visitor at Pratt\'s\r\nHotel, and it was a new pang to him to have to suspect her of duplicity.\r\nOn the other hand, he quickly said to himself, what concern was it of\r\nhis that she should have made an appointment with a lover? Had it not\r\nbeen thought graceful in every age that young ladies should make a\r\nmystery of such appointments? Ralph gave Miss Stackpole a diplomatic\r\nanswer. "I should have thought that, with the views you expressed to me\r\nthe other day, this would satisfy you perfectly."\r\n\r\n"That he should come to see her? That was very well, as far as it went.\r\nIt was a little plot of mine; I let him know that we were in London, and\r\nwhen it had been arranged that I should spend the evening out I sent him\r\na word--the word we just utter to the \'wise.\' I hoped he would find her\r\nalone; I won\'t pretend I didn\'t hope that you\'d be out of the way. He\r\ncame to see her, but he might as well have stayed away."\r\n\r\n"Isabel was cruel?"--and Ralph\'s face lighted with the relief of his\r\ncousin\'s not having shown duplicity.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t exactly know what passed between them. But she gave him no\r\nsatisfaction--she sent him back to America."\r\n\r\n"Poor Mr. Goodwood!" Ralph sighed.\r\n\r\n"Her only idea seems to be to get rid of him," Henrietta went on.\r\n\r\n"Poor Mr. Goodwood!" Ralph repeated. The exclamation, it must be\r\nconfessed, was automatic; it failed exactly to express his thoughts,\r\nwhich were taking another line.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t say that as if you felt it. I don\'t believe you care."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Ralph, "you must remember that I don\'t know this interesting\r\nyoung man--that I\'ve never seen him."\r\n\r\n"Well, I shall see him, and I shall tell him not to give up. If I didn\'t\r\nbelieve Isabel would come round," Miss Stackpole added--"well, I\'d give\r\nup myself. I mean I\'d give _her_ up!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nIt had occurred to Ralph that, in the conditions, Isabel\'s parting with\r\nher friend might be of a slightly embarrassed nature, and he went down\r\nto the door of the hotel in advance of his cousin, who, after a slight\r\ndelay, followed with the traces of an unaccepted remonstrance, as he\r\nthought, in her eyes. The two made the journey to Gardencourt in almost\r\nunbroken silence, and the servant who met them at the station had no\r\nbetter news to give them of Mr. Touchett--a fact which caused Ralph to\r\ncongratulate himself afresh on Sir Matthew Hope\'s having promised to\r\ncome down in the five o\'clock train and spend the night. Mrs. Touchett,\r\nhe learned, on reaching home, had been constantly with the old man and\r\nwas with him at that moment; and this fact made Ralph say to himself\r\nthat, after all, what his mother wanted was just easy occasion. The\r\nfiner natures were those that shone at the larger times. Isabel went to\r\nher own room, noting throughout the house that perceptible hush which\r\nprecedes a crisis. At the end of an hour, however, she came downstairs\r\nin search of her aunt, whom she wished to ask about Mr. Touchett. She\r\nwent into the library, but Mrs. Touchett was not there, and as the\r\nweather, which had been damp and chill, was now altogether spoiled, it\r\nwas not probable she had gone for her usual walk in the grounds. Isabel\r\nwas on the point of ringing to send a question to her room, when this\r\npurpose quickly yielded to an unexpected sound--the sound of low music\r\nproceeding apparently from the saloon. She knew her aunt never touched\r\nthe piano, and the musician was therefore probably Ralph, who played for\r\nhis own amusement. That he should have resorted to this recreation at\r\nthe present time indicated apparently that his anxiety about his father\r\nhad been relieved; so that the girl took her way, almost with restored\r\ncheer, toward the source of the harmony. The drawing-room at Gardencourt\r\nwas an apartment of great distances, and, as the piano was placed at\r\nthe end of it furthest removed from the door at which she entered, her\r\narrival was not noticed by the person seated before the instrument.\r\nThis person was neither Ralph nor his mother; it was a lady whom\r\nIsabel immediately saw to be a stranger to herself, though her back was\r\npresented to the door. This back--an ample and well-dressed one--Isabel\r\nviewed for some moments with surprise. The lady was of course a visitor\r\nwho had arrived during her absence and who had not been mentioned by\r\neither of the servants--one of them her aunt\'s maid--of whom she had had\r\nspeech since her return. Isabel had already learned, however, with\r\nwhat treasures of reserve the function of receiving orders may be\r\naccompanied, and she was particularly conscious of having been treated\r\nwith dryness by her aunt\'s maid, through whose hands she had slipped\r\nperhaps a little too mistrustfully and with an effect of plumage but\r\nthe more lustrous. The advent of a guest was in itself far from\r\ndisconcerting; she had not yet divested herself of a young faith that\r\neach new acquaintance would exert some momentous influence on her life.\r\nBy the time she had made these reflexions she became aware that the\r\nlady at the piano played remarkably well. She was playing something\r\nof Schubert\'s--Isabel knew not what, but recognised Schubert--and she\r\ntouched the piano with a discretion of her own. It showed skill, it\r\nshowed feeling; Isabel sat down noiselessly on the nearest chair and\r\nwaited till the end of the piece. When it was finished she felt a strong\r\ndesire to thank the player, and rose from her seat to do so, while at\r\nthe same time the stranger turned quickly round, as if but just aware of\r\nher presence.\r\n\r\n"That\'s very beautiful, and your playing makes it more beautiful still,"\r\nsaid Isabel with all the young radiance with which she usually uttered a\r\ntruthful rapture.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think I disturbed Mr. Touchett then?" the musician answered\r\nas sweetly as this compliment deserved. "The house is so large and his\r\nroom so far away that I thought I might venture, especially as I played\r\njust--just _du bout des doigts_."\r\n\r\n"She\'s a Frenchwoman," Isabel said to herself; "she says that as if she\r\nwere French." And this supposition made the visitor more interesting to\r\nour speculative heroine. "I hope my uncle\'s doing well," Isabel added.\r\n"I should think that to hear such lovely music as that would really make\r\nhim feel better."\r\n\r\nThe lady smiled and discriminated. "I\'m afraid there are moments in life\r\nwhen even Schubert has nothing to say to us. We must admit, however,\r\nthat they are our worst."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not in that state now then," said Isabel. "On the contrary I should\r\nbe so glad if you would play something more."\r\n\r\n"If it will give you pleasure--delighted." And this obliging person took\r\nher place again and struck a few chords, while Isabel sat down nearer\r\nthe instrument. Suddenly the new-comer stopped with her hands on the\r\nkeys, half-turning and looking over her shoulder. She was forty years\r\nold and not pretty, though her expression charmed. "Pardon me," she\r\nsaid; "but are you the niece--the young American?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m my aunt\'s niece," Isabel replied with simplicity.\r\n\r\nThe lady at the piano sat still a moment longer, casting her air of\r\ninterest over her shoulder. "That\'s very well; we\'re compatriots." And\r\nthen she began to play.\r\n\r\n"Ah then she\'s not French," Isabel murmured; and as the opposite\r\nsupposition had made her romantic it might have seemed that this\r\nrevelation would have marked a drop. But such was not the fact; rarer\r\neven than to be French seemed it to be American on such interesting\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nThe lady played in the same manner as before, softly and solemnly, and\r\nwhile she played the shadows deepened in the room. The autumn twilight\r\ngathered in, and from her place Isabel could see the rain, which had now\r\nbegun in earnest, washing the cold-looking lawn and the wind shaking the\r\ngreat trees. At last, when the music had ceased, her companion got up\r\nand, coming nearer with a smile, before Isabel had time to thank her\r\nagain, said: "I\'m very glad you\'ve come back; I\'ve heard a great deal\r\nabout you."\r\n\r\nIsabel thought her a very attractive person, but nevertheless spoke with\r\na certain abruptness in reply to this speech. "From whom have you heard\r\nabout me?"\r\n\r\nThe stranger hesitated a single moment and then, "From your uncle," she\r\nanswered. "I\'ve been here three days, and the first day he let me come\r\nand pay him a visit in his room. Then he talked constantly of you."\r\n\r\n"As you didn\'t know me that must rather have bored you."\r\n\r\n"It made me want to know you. All the more that since then--your aunt\r\nbeing so much with Mr. Touchett--I\'ve been quite alone and have got\r\nrather tired of my own society. I\'ve not chosen a good moment for my\r\nvisit."\r\n\r\nA servant had come in with lamps and was presently followed by another\r\nbearing the tea-tray. On the appearance of this repast Mrs. Touchett had\r\napparently been notified, for she now arrived and addressed herself to\r\nthe tea-pot. Her greeting to her niece did not differ materially from\r\nher manner of raising the lid of this receptacle in order to glance at\r\nthe contents: in neither act was it becoming to make a show of avidity.\r\nQuestioned about her husband she was unable to say he was better; but\r\nthe local doctor was with him, and much light was expected from this\r\ngentleman\'s consultation with Sir Matthew Hope.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you two ladies have made acquaintance," she pursued. "If you\r\nhaven\'t I recommend you to do so; for so long as we continue--Ralph and\r\nI--to cluster about Mr. Touchett\'s bed you\'re not likely to have much\r\nsociety but each other."\r\n\r\n"I know nothing about you but that you\'re a great musician," Isabel said\r\nto the visitor.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a good deal more than that to know," Mrs. Touchett affirmed in\r\nher little dry tone.\r\n\r\n"A very little of it, I am sure, will content Miss Archer!" the lady\r\nexclaimed with a light laugh. "I\'m an old friend of your aunt\'s.\r\nI\'ve lived much in Florence. I\'m Madame Merle." She made this last\r\nannouncement as if she were referring to a person of tolerably distinct\r\nidentity. For Isabel, however, it represented little; she could only\r\ncontinue to feel that Madame Merle had as charming a manner as any she\r\nhad ever encountered.\r\n\r\n"She\'s not a foreigner in spite of her name," said Mrs. Touchett.\r\n\r\n"She was born--I always forget where you were born."\r\n\r\n"It\'s hardly worth while then I should tell you."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary," said Mrs. Touchett, who rarely missed a logical\r\npoint; "if I remembered your telling me would be quite superfluous."\r\n\r\nMadame Merle glanced at Isabel with a sort of world-wide smile, a\r\nthing that over-reached frontiers. "I was born under the shadow of the\r\nnational banner."\r\n\r\n"She\'s too fond of mystery," said Mrs. Touchett; "that\'s her great\r\nfault."\r\n\r\n"Ah," exclaimed Madame Merle, "I\'ve great faults, but I don\'t think\r\nthat\'s one of then; it certainly isn\'t the greatest. I came into the\r\nworld in the Brooklyn navy-yard. My father was a high officer in the\r\nUnited States Navy, and had a post--a post of responsibility--in that\r\nestablishment at the time. I suppose I ought to love the sea, but I hate\r\nit. That\'s why I don\'t return to America. I love the land; the great\r\nthing is to love something."\r\n\r\nIsabel, as a dispassionate witness, had not been struck with the\r\nforce of Mrs. Touchett\'s characterisation of her visitor, who had an\r\nexpressive, communicative, responsive face, by no means of the sort\r\nwhich, to Isabel\'s mind, suggested a secretive disposition. It was a\r\nface that told of an amplitude of nature and of quick and free motions\r\nand, though it had no regular beauty, was in the highest degree engaging\r\nand attaching. Madame Merle was a tall, fair, smooth woman; everything\r\nin her person was round and replete, though without those accumulations\r\nwhich suggest heaviness. Her features were thick but in perfect\r\nproportion and harmony, and her complexion had a healthy clearness.\r\nHer grey eyes were small but full of light and incapable of\r\nstupidity--incapable, according to some people, even of tears; she had\r\na liberal, full-rimmed mouth which when she smiled drew itself upward to\r\nthe left side in a manner that most people thought very odd, some very\r\naffected and a few very graceful. Isabel inclined to range herself in\r\nthe last category. Madame Merle had thick, fair hair, arranged somehow\r\n"classically" and as if she were a Bust, Isabel judged--a Juno or a\r\nNiobe; and large white hands, of a perfect shape, a shape so perfect\r\nthat their possessor, preferring to leave them unadorned, wore no\r\njewelled rings. Isabel had taken her at first, as we have seen, for\r\na Frenchwoman; but extended observation might have ranked her as a\r\nGerman--a German of high degree, perhaps an Austrian, a baroness, a\r\ncountess, a princess. It would never have been supposed she had come\r\ninto the world in Brooklyn--though one could doubtless not have carried\r\nthrough any argument that the air of distinction marking her in so\r\neminent a degree was inconsistent with such a birth. It was true that\r\nthe national banner had floated immediately over her cradle, and the\r\nbreezy freedom of the stars and stripes might have shed an influence\r\nupon the attitude she there took towards life. And yet she had evidently\r\nnothing of the fluttered, flapping quality of a morsel of bunting in the\r\nwind; her manner expressed the repose and confidence which come from a\r\nlarge experience. Experience, however, had not quenched her youth; it\r\nhad simply made her sympathetic and supple. She was in a word a woman of\r\nstrong impulses kept in admirable order. This commended itself to Isabel\r\nas an ideal combination.\r\n\r\nThe girl made these reflexions while the three ladies sat at their tea,\r\nbut that ceremony was interrupted before long by the arrival of the\r\ngreat doctor from London, who had been immediately ushered into the\r\ndrawing-room. Mrs. Touchett took him off to the library for a private\r\ntalk; and then Madame Merle and Isabel parted, to meet again at dinner.\r\nThe idea of seeing more of this interesting woman did much to mitigate\r\nIsabel\'s sense of the sadness now settling on Gardencourt.\r\n\r\nWhen she came into the drawing-room before dinner she found the place\r\nempty; but in the course of a moment Ralph arrived. His anxiety about\r\nhis father had been lightened; Sir Matthew Hope\'s view of his condition\r\nwas less depressed than his own had been. The doctor recommended that\r\nthe nurse alone should remain with the old man for the next three or\r\nfour hours; so that Ralph, his mother and the great physician himself\r\nwere free to dine at table. Mrs. Touchett and Sir Matthew appeared;\r\nMadame Merle was the last.\r\n\r\nBefore she came Isabel spoke of her to Ralph, who was standing before\r\nthe fireplace. "Pray who is this Madame Merle?"\r\n\r\n"The cleverest woman I know, not excepting yourself," said Ralph.\r\n\r\n"I thought she seemed very pleasant."\r\n\r\n"I was sure you\'d think her very pleasant."\r\n\r\n"Is that why you invited her?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t invite her, and when we came back from London I didn\'t know\r\nshe was here. No one invited her. She\'s a friend of my mother\'s, and\r\njust after you and I went to town my mother got a note from her. She had\r\narrived in England (she usually lives abroad, though she has first and\r\nlast spent a good deal of time here), and asked leave to come down for\r\na few days. She\'s a woman who can make such proposals with perfect\r\nconfidence; she\'s so welcome wherever she goes. And with my mother there\r\ncould be no question of hesitating; she\'s the one person in the world\r\nwhom my mother very much admires. If she were not herself (which she\r\nafter all much prefers), she would like to be Madame Merle. It would\r\nindeed be a great change."\r\n\r\n"Well, she\'s very charming," said Isabel. "And she plays beautifully."\r\n\r\n"She does everything beautifully. She\'s complete."\r\n\r\nIsabel looked at her cousin a moment. "You don\'t like her."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, I was once in love with her."\r\n\r\n"And she didn\'t care for you, and that\'s why you don\'t like her."\r\n\r\n"How can we have discussed such things? Monsieur Merle was then living."\r\n\r\n"Is he dead now?"\r\n\r\n"So she says."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you believe her?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, because the statement agrees with the probabilities. The husband\r\nof Madame Merle would be likely to pass away."\r\n\r\nIsabel gazed at her cousin again. "I don\'t know what you mean. You mean\r\nsomething--that you don\'t mean. What was Monsieur Merle?"\r\n\r\n"The husband of Madame."\r\n\r\n"You\'re very odious. Has she any children?"\r\n\r\n"Not the least little child--fortunately."\r\n\r\n"Fortunately?"\r\n\r\n"I mean fortunately for the child. She\'d be sure to spoil it."\r\n\r\nIsabel was apparently on the point of assuring her cousin for the third\r\ntime that he was odious; but the discussion was interrupted by the\r\narrival of the lady who was the topic of it. She came rustling in\r\nquickly, apologising for being late, fastening a bracelet, dressed in\r\ndark blue satin, which exposed a white bosom that was ineffectually\r\ncovered by a curious silver necklace. Ralph offered her his arm with the\r\nexaggerated alertness of a man who was no longer a lover.\r\n\r\nEven if this had still been his condition, however, Ralph had other\r\nthings to think about. The great doctor spent the night at Gardencourt\r\nand, returning to London on the morrow, after another consultation with\r\nMr. Touchett\'s own medical adviser, concurred in Ralph\'s desire that he\r\nshould see the patient again on the day following. On the day following\r\nSir Matthew Hope reappeared at Gardencourt, and now took a less\r\nencouraging view of the old man, who had grown worse in the twenty-four\r\nhours. His feebleness was extreme, and to his son, who constantly sat\r\nby his bedside, it often seemed that his end must be at hand. The local\r\ndoctor, a very sagacious man, in whom Ralph had secretly more confidence\r\nthan in his distinguished colleague, was constantly in attendance, and\r\nSir Matthew Hope came back several times. Mr. Touchett was much of the\r\ntime unconscious; he slept a great deal; he rarely spoke. Isabel had a\r\ngreat desire to be useful to him and was allowed to watch with him at\r\nhours when his other attendants (of whom Mrs. Touchett was not the least\r\nregular) went to take rest. He never seemed to know her, and she always\r\nsaid to herself "Suppose he should die while I\'m sitting here;" an idea\r\nwhich excited her and kept her awake. Once he opened his eyes for a\r\nwhile and fixed them upon her intelligently, but when she went to him,\r\nhoping he would recognise her, he closed them and relapsed into stupor.\r\nThe day after this, however, he revived for a longer time; but on this\r\noccasion Ralph only was with him. The old man began to talk, much to his\r\nson\'s satisfaction, who assured him that they should presently have him\r\nsitting up.\r\n\r\n"No, my boy," said Mr. Touchett, "not unless you bury me in a sitting\r\nposture, as some of the ancients--was it the ancients?--used to do."\r\n\r\n"Ah, daddy, don\'t talk about that," Ralph murmured. "You mustn\'t deny\r\nthat you\'re getting better."\r\n\r\n"There will be no need of my denying it if you don\'t say it," the old\r\nman answered. "Why should we prevaricate just at the last? We never\r\nprevaricated before. I\'ve got to die some time, and it\'s better to die\r\nwhen one\'s sick than when one\'s well. I\'m very sick--as sick as I shall\r\never be. I hope you don\'t want to prove that I shall ever be worse than\r\nthis? That would be too bad. You don\'t? Well then."\r\n\r\nHaving made this excellent point he became quiet; but the next time that\r\nRalph was with him he again addressed himself to conversation. The\r\nnurse had gone to her supper and Ralph was alone in charge, having just\r\nrelieved Mrs. Touchett, who had been on guard since dinner. The room was\r\nlighted only by the flickering fire, which of late had become necessary,\r\nand Ralph\'s tall shadow was projected over wall and ceiling with an\r\noutline constantly varying but always grotesque.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s that with me--is it my son?" the old man asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it\'s your son, daddy."\r\n\r\n"And is there no one else?"\r\n\r\n"No one else."\r\n\r\nMr. Touchett said nothing for a while; and then, "I want to talk a\r\nlittle," he went on.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t it tire you?" Ralph demurred.\r\n\r\n"It won\'t matter if it does. I shall have a long rest. I want to talk\r\nabout _you_."\r\n\r\nRalph had drawn nearer to the bed; he sat leaning forward with his hand\r\non his father\'s. "You had better select a brighter topic."\r\n\r\n"You were always bright; I used to be proud of your brightness. I should\r\nlike so much to think you\'d do something."\r\n\r\n"If you leave us," said Ralph, "I shall do nothing but miss you."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I don\'t want; it\'s what I want to talk about. You must\r\nget a new interest."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want a new interest, daddy. I have more old ones than I know\r\nwhat to do with."\r\n\r\nThe old man lay there looking at his son; his face was the face of the\r\ndying, but his eyes were the eyes of Daniel Touchett. He seemed to be\r\nreckoning over Ralph\'s interests. "Of course you have your mother," he\r\nsaid at last. "You\'ll take care of her."\r\n\r\n"My mother will always take care of herself," Ralph returned.\r\n\r\n"Well," said his father, "perhaps as she grows older she\'ll need a\r\nlittle help."\r\n\r\n"I shall not see that. She\'ll outlive me."\r\n\r\n"Very likely she will; but that\'s no reason--!" Mr. Touchett let his\r\nphrase die away in a helpless but not quite querulous sigh and remained\r\nsilent again.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t trouble yourself about us," said his son, "My mother and I get on\r\nvery well together, you know."\r\n\r\n"You get on by always being apart; that\'s not natural."\r\n\r\n"If you leave us we shall probably see more of each other."\r\n\r\n"Well," the old man observed with wandering irrelevance, "it can\'t be\r\nsaid that my death will make much difference in your mother\'s life."\r\n\r\n"It will probably make more than you think."\r\n\r\n"Well, she\'ll have more money," said Mr. Touchett. "I\'ve left her a good\r\nwife\'s portion, just as if she had been a good wife."\r\n\r\n"She has been one, daddy, according to her own theory. She has never\r\ntroubled you."\r\n\r\n"Ah, some troubles are pleasant," Mr. Touchett murmured. "Those you\'ve\r\ngiven me for instance. But your mother has been less--less--what shall\r\nI call it? less out of the way since I\'ve been ill. I presume she knows\r\nI\'ve noticed it."\r\n\r\n"I shall certainly tell her so; I\'m so glad you mention it."\r\n\r\n"It won\'t make any difference to her; she doesn\'t do it to please me.\r\nShe does it to please--to please--" And he lay a while trying to think\r\nwhy she did it. "She does it because it suits her. But that\'s not what\r\nI want to talk about," he added. "It\'s about you. You\'ll be very well\r\noff."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Ralph, "I know that. But I hope you\'ve not forgotten the\r\ntalk we had a year ago--when I told you exactly what money I should need\r\nand begged you to make some good use of the rest."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I remember. I made a new will--in a few days. I suppose it\r\nwas the first time such a thing had happened--a young man trying to get\r\na will made against him."\r\n\r\n"It is not against me," said Ralph. "It would be against me to have a\r\nlarge property to take care of. It\'s impossible for a man in my state of\r\nhealth to spend much money, and enough is as good as a feast."\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'ll have enough--and something over. There will be more than\r\nenough for one--there will be enough for two."\r\n\r\n"That\'s too much," said Ralph.\r\n\r\n"Ah, don\'t say that. The best thing you can do; when I\'m gone, will be\r\nto marry."\r\n\r\nRalph had foreseen what his father was coming to, and this suggestion\r\nwas by no means fresh. It had long been Mr. Touchett\'s most ingenious\r\nway of taking the cheerful view of his son\'s possible duration. Ralph\r\nhad usually treated it facetiously; but present circumstances proscribed\r\nthe facetious. He simply fell back in his chair and returned his\r\nfather\'s appealing gaze.\r\n\r\n"If I, with a wife who hasn\'t been very fond of me, have had a very\r\nhappy life," said the old man, carrying his ingenuity further still,\r\n"what a life mightn\'t you have if you should marry a person different\r\nfrom Mrs. Touchett. There are more different from her than there are\r\nlike her." Ralph still said nothing; and after a pause his father\r\nresumed softly: "What do you think of your cousin?"\r\n\r\nAt this Ralph started, meeting the question with a strained smile. "Do I\r\nunderstand you to propose that I should marry Isabel?"\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s what it comes to in the end. Don\'t you like Isabel?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, very much." And Ralph got up from his chair and wandered over to\r\nthe fire. He stood before it an instant and then he stooped and stirred\r\nit mechanically. "I like Isabel very much," he repeated.\r\n\r\n"Well," said his father, "I know she likes you. She has told me how much\r\nshe likes you."\r\n\r\n"Did she remark that she would like to marry me?"\r\n\r\n"No, but she can\'t have anything against you. And she\'s the most\r\ncharming young lady I\'ve ever seen. And she would be good to you. I have\r\nthought a great deal about it."\r\n\r\n"So have I," said Ralph, coming back to the bedside again. "I don\'t mind\r\ntelling you that."\r\n\r\n"You _are_ in love with her then? I should think you would be. It\'s as if\r\nshe came over on purpose."\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not in love with her; but I should be if--if certain things\r\nwere different."\r\n\r\n"Ah, things are always different from what they might be," said the old\r\nman. "If you wait for them to change you\'ll never do anything. I don\'t\r\nknow whether you know," he went on; "but I suppose there\'s no harm in\r\nmy alluding to it at such an hour as this: there was some one wanted to\r\nmarry Isabel the other day, and she wouldn\'t have him."\r\n\r\n"I know she refused Warburton: he told me himself."\r\n\r\n"Well, that proves there\'s a chance for somebody else."\r\n\r\n"Somebody else took his chance the other day in London--and got nothing\r\nby it."\r\n\r\n"Was it you?" Mr. Touchett eagerly asked.\r\n\r\n"No, it was an older friend; a poor gentleman who came over from America\r\nto see about it."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m sorry for him, whoever he was. But it only proves what I\r\nsay--that the way\'s open to you."\r\n\r\n"If it is, dear father, it\'s all the greater pity that I\'m unable to\r\ntread it. I haven\'t many convictions; but I have three or four that I\r\nhold strongly. One is that people, on the whole, had better not marry\r\ntheir cousins. Another is that people in an advanced stage of pulmonary\r\ndisorder had better not marry at all."\r\n\r\nThe old man raised his weak hand and moved it to and fro before his\r\nface. "What do you mean by that? You look at things in a way that would\r\nmake everything wrong. What sort of a cousin is a cousin that you\r\nhad never seen for more than twenty years of her life? We\'re all each\r\nother\'s cousins, and if we stopped at that the human race would die out.\r\nIt\'s just the same with your bad lung. You\'re a great deal better than\r\nyou used to be. All you want is to lead a natural life. It is a great\r\ndeal more natural to marry a pretty young lady that you\'re in love with\r\nthan it is to remain single on false principles."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not in love with Isabel," said Ralph.\r\n\r\n"You said just now that you would be if you didn\'t think it wrong. I\r\nwant to prove to you that it isn\'t wrong."\r\n\r\n"It will only tire you, dear daddy," said Ralph, who marvelled at his\r\nfather\'s tenacity and at his finding strength to insist. "Then where\r\nshall we all be?"\r\n\r\n"Where shall you be if I don\'t provide for you? You won\'t have anything\r\nto do with the bank, and you won\'t have me to take care of. You say\r\nyou\'ve so many interests; but I can\'t make them out."\r\n\r\nRalph leaned back in his chair with folded arms; his eyes were fixed for\r\nsome time in meditation. At last, with the air of a man fairly mustering\r\ncourage, "I take a great interest in my cousin," he said, "but not the\r\nsort of interest you desire. I shall not live many years; but I hope I\r\nshall live long enough to see what she does with herself. She\'s entirely\r\nindependent of me; I can exercise very little influence upon her life.\r\nBut I should like to do something for her."\r\n\r\n"What should you like to do?"\r\n\r\n"I should like to put a little wind in her sails."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by that?"\r\n\r\n"I should like to put it into her power to do some of the things she\r\nwants. She wants to see the world for instance. I should like to put\r\nmoney in her purse."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I\'m glad you\'ve thought of that," said the old man. "But I\'ve\r\nthought of it too. I\'ve left her a legacy--five thousand pounds."\r\n\r\n"That\'s capital; it\'s very kind of you. But I should like to do a little\r\nmore."\r\n\r\nSomething of that veiled acuteness with which it had been on Daniel\r\nTouchett\'s part the habit of a lifetime to listen to a financial\r\nproposition still lingered in the face in which the invalid had not\r\nobliterated the man of business. "I shall be happy to consider it," he\r\nsaid softly.\r\n\r\n"Isabel\'s poor then. My mother tells me that she has but a few hundred\r\ndollars a year. I should like to make her rich."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by rich?"\r\n\r\n"I call people rich when they\'re able to meet the requirements of their\r\nimagination. Isabel has a great deal of imagination."\r\n\r\n"So have you, my son," said Mr. Touchett, listening very attentively but\r\na little confusedly.\r\n\r\n"You tell me I shall have money enough for two. What I want is that you\r\nshould kindly relieve me of my superfluity and make it over to Isabel.\r\nDivide my inheritance into two equal halves and give her the second."\r\n\r\n"To do what she likes with?"\r\n\r\n"Absolutely what she likes."\r\n\r\n"And without an equivalent?"\r\n\r\n"What equivalent could there be?"\r\n\r\n"The one I\'ve already mentioned."\r\n\r\n"Her marrying--some one or other? It\'s just to do away with anything of\r\nthat sort that I make my suggestion. If she has an easy income she\'ll\r\nnever have to marry for a support. That\'s what I want cannily to\r\nprevent. She wishes to be free, and your bequest will make her free."\r\n\r\n"Well, you seem to have thought it out," said Mr. Touchett. "But I don\'t\r\nsee why you appeal to me. The money will be yours, and you can easily\r\ngive it to her yourself."\r\n\r\nRalph openly stared. "Ah, dear father, I can\'t offer Isabel money!"\r\n\r\nThe old man gave a groan. "Don\'t tell me you\'re not in love with her! Do\r\nyou want me to have the credit of it?"\r\n\r\n"Entirely. I should like it simply to be a clause in your will, without\r\nthe slightest reference to me."\r\n\r\n"Do you want me to make a new will then?"\r\n\r\n"A few words will do it; you can attend to it the next time you feel a\r\nlittle lively."\r\n\r\n"You must telegraph to Mr. Hilary then. I\'ll do nothing without my\r\nsolicitor."\r\n\r\n"You shall see Mr. Hilary to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"He\'ll think we\'ve quarrelled, you and I," said the old man.\r\n\r\n"Very probably; I shall like him to think it," said Ralph, smiling;\r\n"and, to carry out the idea, I give you notice that I shall be very\r\nsharp, quite horrid and strange, with you."\r\n\r\nThe humour of this appeared to touch his father, who lay a little while\r\ntaking it in. "I\'ll do anything you like," Mr. Touchett said at last;\r\n"but I\'m not sure it\'s right. You say you want to put wind in her sails;\r\nbut aren\'t you afraid of putting too much?"\r\n\r\n"I should like to see her going before the breeze!" Ralph answered.\r\n\r\n"You speak as if it were for your mere amusement."\r\n\r\n"So it is, a good deal."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t think I understand," said Mr. Touchett with a sigh.\r\n"Young men are very different from what I was. When I cared for a\r\ngirl--when I was young--I wanted to do more than look at her."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve scruples that I shouldn\'t have had, and you\'ve ideas that I\r\nshouldn\'t have had either. You say Isabel wants to be free, and that\r\nher being rich will keep her from marrying for money. Do you think that\r\nshe\'s a girl to do that?"\r\n\r\n"By no means. But she has less money than she has ever had before. Her\r\nfather then gave her everything, because he used to spend his capital.\r\nShe has nothing but the crumbs of that feast to live on, and she doesn\'t\r\nreally know how meagre they are--she has yet to learn it. My mother has\r\ntold me all about it. Isabel will learn it when she\'s really thrown upon\r\nthe world, and it would be very painful to me to think of her coming to\r\nthe consciousness of a lot of wants she should be unable to satisfy."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve left her five thousand pounds. She can satisfy a good many wants\r\nwith that."\r\n\r\n"She can indeed. But she would probably spend it in two or three years."\r\n\r\n"You think she\'d be extravagant then?"\r\n\r\n"Most certainly," said Ralph, smiling serenely.\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Touchett\'s acuteness was rapidly giving place to pure\r\nconfusion. "It would merely be a question of time then, her spending the\r\nlarger sum?"\r\n\r\n"No--though at first I think she\'d plunge into that pretty freely: she\'d\r\nprobably make over a part of it to each of her sisters. But after that\r\nshe\'d come to her senses, remember she has still a lifetime before her,\r\nand live within her means."\r\n\r\n"Well, you _have_ worked it out," said the old man helplessly. "You do\r\ntake an interest in her, certainly."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t consistently say I go too far. You wished me to go further."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know," Mr. Touchett answered. "I don\'t think I enter into\r\nyour spirit. It seems to me immoral."\r\n\r\n"Immoral, dear daddy?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know that it\'s right to make everything so easy for a\r\nperson."\r\n\r\n"It surely depends upon the person. When the person\'s good, your making\r\nthings easy is all to the credit of virtue. To facilitate the execution\r\nof good impulses, what can be a nobler act?"\r\n\r\nThis was a little difficult to follow, and Mr. Touchett considered it\r\nfor a while. At last he said: "Isabel\'s a sweet young thing; but do you\r\nthink she\'s so good as that?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s as good as her best opportunities," Ralph returned.\r\n\r\n"Well," Mr. Touchett declared, "she ought to get a great many\r\nopportunities for sixty thousand pounds."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no doubt she will."\r\n\r\n"Of course I\'ll do what you want," said the old man. "I only want to\r\nunderstand it a little."\r\n\r\n"Well, dear daddy, don\'t you understand it now?" his son caressingly\r\nasked. "If you don\'t we won\'t take any more trouble about it. We\'ll\r\nleave it alone."\r\n\r\nMr. Touchett lay a long time still. Ralph supposed he had given up the\r\nattempt to follow. But at last, quite lucidly, he began again. "Tell\r\nme this first. Doesn\'t it occur to you that a young lady with sixty\r\nthousand pounds may fall a victim to the fortune-hunters?"\r\n\r\n"She\'ll hardly fall a victim to more than one."\r\n\r\n"Well, one\'s too many."\r\n\r\n"Decidedly. That\'s a risk, and it has entered into my calculation. I\r\nthink it\'s appreciable, but I think it\'s small, and I\'m prepared to take\r\nit."\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Touchett\'s acuteness had passed into perplexity, and his\r\nperplexity now passed into admiration. "Well, you have gone into it!" he\r\nrepeated. "But I don\'t see what good you\'re to get of it."\r\n\r\nRalph leaned over his father\'s pillows and gently smoothed them; he was\r\naware their talk had been unduly prolonged. "I shall get just the good\r\nI said a few moments ago I wished to put into Isabel\'s reach--that of\r\nhaving met the requirements of my imagination. But it\'s scandalous, the\r\nway I\'ve taken advantage of you!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Touchett had foretold, Isabel and Madame Merle were thrown\r\nmuch together during the illness of their host, so that if they had\r\nnot become intimate it would have been almost a breach of good manners.\r\nTheir manners were of the best, but in addition to this they happened\r\nto please each other. It is perhaps too much to say that they swore\r\nan eternal friendship, but tacitly at least they called the future to\r\nwitness. Isabel did so with a perfectly good conscience, though she\r\nwould have hesitated to admit she was intimate with her new friend in\r\nthe high sense she privately attached to this term. She often wondered\r\nindeed if she ever had been, or ever could be, intimate with any one.\r\nShe had an ideal of friendship as well as of several other sentiments,\r\nwhich it failed to seem to her in this case--it had not seemed to her\r\nin other cases--that the actual completely expressed it. But she often\r\nreminded herself that there were essential reasons why one\'s ideal\r\ncould never become concrete. It was a thing to believe in, not to see--a\r\nmatter of faith, not of experience. Experience, however, might supply\r\nus with very creditable imitations of it, and the part of wisdom was\r\nto make the best of these. Certainly, on the whole, Isabel had never\r\nencountered a more agreeable and interesting figure than Madame Merle;\r\nshe had never met a person having less of that fault which is the\r\nprincipal obstacle to friendship--the air of reproducing the more\r\ntiresome, the stale, the too-familiar parts of one\'s own character.\r\nThe gates of the girl\'s confidence were opened wider than they had ever\r\nbeen; she said things to this amiable auditress that she had not yet\r\nsaid to any one. Sometimes she took alarm at her candour: it was as\r\nif she had given to a comparative stranger the key to her cabinet of\r\njewels. These spiritual gems were the only ones of any magnitude that\r\nIsabel possessed, but there was all the greater reason for their being\r\ncarefully guarded. Afterwards, however, she always remembered that one\r\nshould never regret a generous error and that if Madame Merle had not\r\nthe merits she attributed to her, so much the worse for Madame Merle.\r\nThere was no doubt she had great merits--she was charming, sympathetic,\r\nintelligent, cultivated. More than this (for it had not been Isabel\'s\r\nill-fortune to go through life without meeting in her own sex several\r\npersons of whom no less could fairly be said), she was rare, superior\r\nand preeminent. There are many amiable people in the world, and Madame\r\nMerle was far from being vulgarly good-natured and restlessly witty. She\r\nknew how to think--an accomplishment rare in women; and she had thought\r\nto very good purpose. Of course, too, she knew how to feel; Isabel\r\ncouldn\'t have spent a week with her without being sure of that. This was\r\nindeed Madame Merle\'s great talent, her most perfect gift. Life had told\r\nupon her; she had felt it strongly, and it was part of the satisfaction\r\nto be taken in her society that when the girl talked of what she was\r\npleased to call serious matters this lady understood her so easily and\r\nquickly. Emotion, it is true, had become with her rather historic; she\r\nmade no secret of the fact that the fount of passion, thanks to having\r\nbeen rather violently tapped at one period, didn\'t flow quite so\r\nfreely as of yore. She proposed moreover, as well as expected, to cease\r\nfeeling; she freely admitted that of old she had been a little mad, and\r\nnow she pretended to be perfectly sane.\r\n\r\n"I judge more than I used to," she said to Isabel, "but it seems to me\r\none has earned the right. One can\'t judge till one\'s forty; before that\r\nwe\'re too eager, too hard, too cruel, and in addition much too ignorant.\r\nI\'m sorry for you; it will be a long time before you\'re forty. But every\r\ngain\'s a loss of some kind; I often think that after forty one can\'t\r\nreally feel. The freshness, the quickness have certainly gone. You\'ll\r\nkeep them longer than most people; it will be a great satisfaction to me\r\nto see you some years hence. I want to see what life makes of you. One\r\nthing\'s certain--it can\'t spoil you. It may pull you about horribly, but\r\nI defy it to break you up."\r\n\r\nIsabel received this assurance as a young soldier, still panting from\r\na slight skirmish in which he has come off with honour, might receive a\r\npat on the shoulder from his colonel. Like such a recognition of merit\r\nit seemed to come with authority. How could the lightest word do less\r\non the part of a person who was prepared to say, of almost everything\r\nIsabel told her, "Oh, I\'ve been in that, my dear; it passes, like\r\neverything else." On many of her interlocutors Madame Merle might have\r\nproduced an irritating effect; it was disconcertingly difficult to\r\nsurprise her. But Isabel, though by no means incapable of desiring to\r\nbe effective, had not at present this impulse. She was too sincere, too\r\ninterested in her judicious companion. And then moreover Madame Merle\r\nnever said such things in the tone of triumph or of boastfulness; they\r\ndropped from her like cold confessions.\r\n\r\nA period of bad weather had settled upon Gardencourt; the days grew\r\nshorter and there was an end to the pretty tea-parties on the lawn. But\r\nour young woman had long indoor conversations with her fellow visitor,\r\nand in spite of the rain the two ladies often sallied forth for a walk,\r\nequipped with the defensive apparatus which the English climate and\r\nthe English genius have between them brought to such perfection. Madame\r\nMerle liked almost everything, including the English rain. "There\'s\r\nalways a little of it and never too much at once," she said; "and it\r\nnever wets you and it always smells good." She declared that in England\r\nthe pleasures of smell were great--that in this inimitable island there\r\nwas a certain mixture of fog and beer and soot which, however odd it\r\nmight sound, was the national aroma, and was most agreeable to the\r\nnostril; and she used to lift the sleeve of her British overcoat and\r\nbury her nose in it, inhaling the clear, fine scent of the wool. Poor\r\nRalph Touchett, as soon as the autumn had begun to define itself, became\r\nalmost a prisoner; in bad weather he was unable to step out of the\r\nhouse, and he used sometimes to stand at one of the windows with his\r\nhands in his pockets and, from a countenance half-rueful, half-critical,\r\nwatch Isabel and Madame Merle as they walked down the avenue under a\r\npair of umbrellas. The roads about Gardencourt were so firm, even in the\r\nworst weather, that the two ladies always came back with a healthy glow\r\nin their cheeks, looking at the soles of their neat, stout boots and\r\ndeclaring that their walk had done them inexpressible good. Before\r\nluncheon, always, Madame Merle was engaged; Isabel admired and envied\r\nher rigid possession of her morning. Our heroine had always passed for a\r\nperson of resources and had taken a certain pride in being one; but she\r\nwandered, as by the wrong side of the wall of a private garden, round\r\nthe enclosed talents, accomplishments, aptitudes of Madame Merle. She\r\nfound herself desiring to emulate them, and in twenty such ways this\r\nlady presented herself as a model. "I should like awfully to be so!"\r\nIsabel secretly exclaimed, more than once, as one after another of her\r\nfriend\'s fine aspects caught the light, and before long she knew that\r\nshe had learned a lesson from a high authority. It took no great time\r\nindeed for her to feel herself, as the phrase is, under an influence.\r\n"What\'s the harm," she wondered, "so long as it\'s a good one? The more\r\none\'s under a good influence the better. The only thing is to see our\r\nsteps as we take them--to understand them as we go. That, no doubt, I\r\nshall always do. I needn\'t be afraid of becoming too pliable; isn\'t it\r\nmy fault that I\'m not pliable enough?" It is said that imitation is the\r\nsincerest flattery; and if Isabel was sometimes moved to gape at her\r\nfriend aspiringly and despairingly it was not so much because she\r\ndesired herself to shine as because she wished to hold up the lamp for\r\nMadame Merle. She liked her extremely, but was even more dazzled than\r\nattracted. She sometimes asked herself what Henrietta Stackpole would\r\nsay to her thinking so much of this perverted product of their common\r\nsoil, and had a conviction that it would be severely judged. Henrietta\r\nwould not at all subscribe to Madame Merle; for reasons she could not\r\nhave defined this truth came home to the girl. On the other hand she\r\nwas equally sure that, should the occasion offer, her new friend would\r\nstrike off some happy view of her old: Madame Merle was too humorous,\r\ntoo observant, not to do justice to Henrietta, and on becoming\r\nacquainted with her would probably give the measure of a tact which\r\nMiss Stackpole couldn\'t hope to emulate. She appeared to have in her\r\nexperience a touchstone for everything, and somewhere in the capacious\r\npocket of her genial memory she would find the key to Henrietta\'s value.\r\n"That\'s the great thing," Isabel solemnly pondered; "that\'s the supreme\r\ngood fortune: to be in a better position for appreciating people than\r\nthey are for appreciating you." And she added that such, when one\r\nconsidered it, was simply the essence of the aristocratic situation.\r\nIn this light, if in none other, one should aim at the aristocratic\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nI may not count over all the links in the chain which led Isabel to\r\nthink of Madame Merle\'s situation as aristocratic--a view of it never\r\nexpressed in any reference made to it by that lady herself. She had\r\nknown great things and great people, but she had never played a great\r\npart. She was one of the small ones of the earth; she had not been born\r\nto honours; she knew the world too well to nourish fatuous illusions\r\non the article of her own place in it. She had encountered many of the\r\nfortunate few and was perfectly aware of those points at which their\r\nfortune differed from hers. But if by her informed measure she was no\r\nfigure for a high scene, she had yet to Isabel\'s imagination a sort of\r\ngreatness. To be so cultivated and civilised, so wise and so easy,\r\nand still make so light of it--that was really to be a great lady,\r\nespecially when one so carried and presented one\'s self. It was as if\r\nsomehow she had all society under contribution, and all the arts and\r\ngraces it practised--or was the effect rather that of charming uses\r\nfound for her, even from a distance, subtle service rendered by her to\r\na clamorous world wherever she might be? After breakfast she wrote a\r\nsuccession of letters, as those arriving for her appeared innumerable:\r\nher correspondence was a source of surprise to Isabel when they\r\nsometimes walked together to the village post-office to deposit Madame\r\nMerle\'s offering to the mail. She knew more people, as she told Isabel,\r\nthan she knew what to do with, and something was always turning up to be\r\nwritten about. Of painting she was devotedly fond, and made no more of\r\nbrushing in a sketch than of pulling off her gloves. At Gardencourt she\r\nwas perpetually taking advantage of an hour\'s sunshine to go out with a\r\ncamp-stool and a box of water-colours. That she was a brave musician we\r\nhave already perceived, and it was evidence of the fact that when she\r\nseated herself at the piano, as she always did in the evening, her\r\nlisteners resigned themselves without a murmur to losing the grace\r\nof her talk. Isabel, since she had known her, felt ashamed of her own\r\nfacility, which she now looked upon as basely inferior; and indeed,\r\nthough she had been thought rather a prodigy at home, the loss to\r\nsociety when, in taking her place upon the music-stool, she turned her\r\nback to the room, was usually deemed greater than the gain. When Madame\r\nMerle was neither writing, nor painting, nor touching the piano, she\r\nwas usually employed upon wonderful tasks of rich embroidery, cushions,\r\ncurtains, decorations for the chimneypiece; an art in which her bold,\r\nfree invention was as noted as the agility of her needle. She was never\r\nidle, for when engaged in none of the ways I have mentioned she was\r\neither reading (she appeared to Isabel to read "everything important"),\r\nor walking out, or playing patience with the cards, or talking with her\r\nfellow inmates. And with all this she had always the social quality, was\r\nnever rudely absent and yet never too seated. She laid down her pastimes\r\nas easily as she took them up; she worked and talked at the same time,\r\nand appeared to impute scant worth to anything she did. She gave away\r\nher sketches and tapestries; she rose from the piano or remained\r\nthere, according to the convenience of her auditors, which she always\r\nunerringly divined. She was in short the most comfortable, profitable,\r\namenable person to live with. If for Isabel she had a fault it was that\r\nshe was not natural; by which the girl meant, not that she was either\r\naffected or pretentious, since from these vulgar vices no woman could\r\nhave been more exempt, but that her nature had been too much overlaid by\r\ncustom and her angles too much rubbed away. She had become too flexible,\r\ntoo useful, was too ripe and too final. She was in a word too perfectly\r\nthe social animal that man and woman are supposed to have been intended\r\nto be; and she had rid herself of every remnant of that tonic wildness\r\nwhich we may assume to have belonged even to the most amiable persons\r\nin the ages before country-house life was the fashion. Isabel found it\r\ndifficult to think of her in any detachment or privacy, she existed only\r\nin her relations, direct or indirect, with her fellow mortals. One might\r\nwonder what commerce she could possibly hold with her own spirit.\r\nOne always ended, however, by feeling that a charming surface doesn\'t\r\nnecessarily prove one superficial; this was an illusion in which, in\r\none\'s youth, one had but just escaped being nourished. Madame Merle was\r\nnot superficial--not she. She was deep, and her nature spoke none the\r\nless in her behaviour because it spoke a conventional tongue. "What\'s\r\nlanguage at all but a convention?" said Isabel. "She has the good\r\ntaste not to pretend, like some people I\'ve met, to express herself by\r\noriginal signs."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid you\'ve suffered much," she once found occasion to say to her\r\nfriend in response to some allusion that had appeared to reach far.\r\n\r\n"What makes you think that?" Madame Merle asked with the amused smile\r\nof a person seated at a game of guesses. "I hope I haven\'t too much the\r\ndroop of the misunderstood."\r\n\r\n"No; but you sometimes say things that I think people who have always\r\nbeen happy wouldn\'t have found out."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t always been happy," said Madame Merle, smiling still, but\r\nwith a mock gravity, as if she were telling a child a secret. "Such a\r\nwonderful thing!"\r\n\r\nBut Isabel rose to the irony. "A great many people give me the\r\nimpression of never having for a moment felt anything."\r\n\r\n"It\'s very true; there are many more iron pots certainly than porcelain.\r\nBut you may depend on it that every one bears some mark; even the\r\nhardest iron pots have a little bruise, a little hole somewhere. I\r\nflatter myself that I\'m rather stout, but if I must tell you the truth\r\nI\'ve been shockingly chipped and cracked. I do very well for service\r\nyet, because I\'ve been cleverly mended; and I try to remain in the\r\ncupboard--the quiet, dusky cupboard where there\'s an odour of stale\r\nspices--as much as I can. But when I\'ve to come out and into a strong\r\nlight--then, my dear, I\'m a horror!"\r\n\r\nI know not whether it was on this occasion or on some other that the\r\nconversation had taken the turn I have just indicated she said to Isabel\r\nthat she would some day a tale unfold. Isabel assured her she should\r\ndelight to listen to one, and reminded her more than once of this\r\nengagement. Madame Merle, however, begged repeatedly for a respite, and\r\nat last frankly told her young companion that they must wait till they\r\nknew each other better. This would be sure to happen, a long friendship\r\nso visibly lay before them. Isabel assented, but at the same time\r\nenquired if she mightn\'t be trusted--if she appeared capable of a\r\nbetrayal of confidence.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not that I\'m afraid of your repeating what I say," her fellow\r\nvisitor answered; "I\'m afraid, on the contrary, of your taking it too\r\nmuch to yourself. You\'d judge me too harshly; you\'re of the cruel age."\r\nShe preferred for the present to talk to Isabel of Isabel, and exhibited\r\nthe greatest interest in our heroine\'s history, sentiments, opinions,\r\nprospects. She made her chatter and listened to her chatter with\r\ninfinite good nature. This flattered and quickened the girl, who was\r\nstruck with all the distinguished people her friend had known and with\r\nher having lived, as Mrs. Touchett said, in the best company in Europe.\r\nIsabel thought the better of herself for enjoying the favour of a person\r\nwho had so large a field of comparison; and it was perhaps partly to\r\ngratify the sense of profiting by comparison that she often appealed to\r\nthese stores of reminiscence. Madame Merle had been a dweller in many\r\nlands and had social ties in a dozen different countries. "I don\'t\r\npretend to be educated," she would say, "but I think I know my Europe;"\r\nand she spoke one day of going to Sweden to stay with an old friend,\r\nand another of proceeding to Malta to follow up a new acquaintance. With\r\nEngland, where she had often dwelt, she was thoroughly familiar, and\r\nfor Isabel\'s benefit threw a great deal of light upon the customs of\r\nthe country and the character of the people, who "after all," as she was\r\nfond of saying, were the most convenient in the world to live with.\r\n\r\n"You mustn\'t think it strange her remaining here at such a time as this,\r\nwhen Mr. Touchett\'s passing away," that gentleman\'s wife remarked to her\r\nniece. "She is incapable of a mistake; she\'s the most tactful woman I\r\nknow. It\'s a favour to me that she stays; she\'s putting off a lot of\r\nvisits at great houses," said Mrs. Touchett, who never forgot that when\r\nshe herself was in England her social value sank two or three degrees in\r\nthe scale. "She has her pick of places; she\'s not in want of a shelter.\r\nBut I\'ve asked her to put in this time because I wish you to know her. I\r\nthink it will be a good thing for you. Serena Merle hasn\'t a fault."\r\n\r\n"If I didn\'t already like her very much that description might alarm\r\nme," Isabel returned.\r\n\r\n"She\'s never the least little bit \'off.\' I\'ve brought you out here and I\r\nwish to do the best for you. Your sister Lily told me she hoped I would\r\ngive you plenty of opportunities. I give you one in putting you in\r\nrelation with Madame Merle. She\'s one of the most brilliant women in\r\nEurope."\r\n\r\n"I like her better than I like your description of her," Isabel\r\npersisted in saying.\r\n\r\n"Do you flatter yourself that you\'ll ever feel her open to criticism? I\r\nhope you\'ll let me know when you do."\r\n\r\n"That will be cruel--to you," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t mind me. You won\'t discover a fault in her."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not. But I dare say I shan\'t miss it."\r\n\r\n"She knows absolutely everything on earth there is to know," said Mrs.\r\nTouchett.\r\n\r\nIsabel after this observed to their companion that she hoped she knew\r\nMrs. Touchett considered she hadn\'t a speck on her perfection. On which\r\n"I\'m obliged to you," Madame Merle replied, "but I\'m afraid your aunt\r\nimagines, or at least alludes to, no aberrations that the clock-face\r\ndoesn\'t register."\r\n\r\n"So that you mean you\'ve a wild side that\'s unknown to her?"\r\n\r\n"Ah no, I fear my darkest sides are my tamest. I mean that having no\r\nfaults, for your aunt, means that one\'s never late for dinner--that is\r\nfor her dinner. I was not late, by the way, the other day, when you\r\ncame back from London; the clock was just at eight when I came into the\r\ndrawing-room: it was the rest of you that were before the time. It means\r\nthat one answers a letter the day one gets it and that when one comes to\r\nstay with her one doesn\'t bring too much luggage and is careful not to\r\nbe taken ill. For Mrs. Touchett those things constitute virtue; it\'s a\r\nblessing to be able to reduce it to its elements."\r\n\r\nMadame Merle\'s own conversation, it will be perceived, was enriched with\r\nbold, free touches of criticism, which, even when they had a restrictive\r\neffect, never struck Isabel as ill-natured. It couldn\'t occur to the\r\ngirl for instance that Mrs. Touchett\'s accomplished guest was abusing\r\nher; and this for very good reasons. In the first place Isabel rose\r\neagerly to the sense of her shades; in the second Madame Merle implied\r\nthat there was a great deal more to say; and it was clear in the\r\nthird that for a person to speak to one without ceremony of one\'s near\r\nrelations was an agreeable sign of that person\'s intimacy with one\'s\r\nself. These signs of deep communion multiplied as the days elapsed, and\r\nthere was none of which Isabel was more sensible than of her companion\'s\r\npreference for making Miss Archer herself a topic. Though she referred\r\nfrequently to the incidents of her own career she never lingered upon\r\nthem; she was as little of a gross egotist as she was of a flat gossip.\r\n\r\n"I\'m old and stale and faded," she said more than once; "I\'m of no\r\nmore interest than last week\'s newspaper. You\'re young and fresh and of\r\nto-day; you\'ve the great thing--you\'ve actuality. I once had it--we all\r\nhave it for an hour. You, however, will have it for longer. Let us talk\r\nabout you then; you can say nothing I shall not care to hear. It\'s a\r\nsign that I\'m growing old--that I like to talk with younger people. I\r\nthink it\'s a very pretty compensation. If we can\'t have youth within us\r\nwe can have it outside, and I really think we see it and feel it better\r\nthat way. Of course we must be in sympathy with it--that I shall always\r\nbe. I don\'t know that I shall ever be ill-natured with old people--I\r\nhope not; there are certainly some old people I adore. But I shall never\r\nbe anything but abject with the young; they touch me and appeal to me\r\ntoo much. I give you _carte blanche_ then; you can even be impertinent if\r\nyou like; I shall let it pass and horribly spoil you. I speak as if I\r\nwere a hundred years old, you say? Well, I am, if you please; I was born\r\nbefore the French Revolution. Ah, my dear, _je viens de loin_; I belong to\r\nthe old, old world. But it\'s not of that I want to talk; I want to talk\r\nabout the new. You must tell me more about America; you never tell me\r\nenough. Here I\'ve been since I was brought here as a helpless child, and\r\nit\'s ridiculous, or rather it\'s scandalous, how little I know about that\r\nsplendid, dreadful, funny country--surely the greatest and drollest of\r\nthem all. There are a great many of us like that in these parts, and I\r\nmust say I think we\'re a wretched set of people. You should live in your\r\nown land; whatever it may be you have your natural place there. If we\'re\r\nnot good Americans we\'re certainly poor Europeans; we\'ve no natural\r\nplace here. We\'re mere parasites, crawling over the surface; we haven\'t\r\nour feet in the soil. At least one can know it and not have illusions. A\r\nwoman perhaps can get on; a woman, it seems to me, has no natural place\r\nanywhere; wherever she finds herself she has to remain on the surface\r\nand, more or less, to crawl. You protest, my dear? you\'re horrified?\r\nyou declare you\'ll never crawl? It\'s very true that I don\'t see you\r\ncrawling; you stand more upright than a good many poor creatures.\r\nVery good; on the whole, I don\'t think you\'ll crawl. But the men, the\r\nAmericans; _je vous demande un peu_, what do they make of it over here?\r\nI don\'t envy them trying to arrange themselves. Look at poor Ralph\r\nTouchett: what sort of a figure do you call that? Fortunately he has a\r\nconsumption; I say fortunately, because it gives him something to do.\r\nHis consumption\'s his _carriere_ it\'s a kind of position. You can say:\r\n\'Oh, Mr. Touchett, he takes care of his lungs, he knows a great deal\r\nabout climates.\' But without that who would he be, what would he\r\nrepresent? \'Mr. Ralph Touchett: an American who lives in Europe.\' That\r\nsignifies absolutely nothing--it\'s impossible anything should signify\r\nless. \'He\'s very cultivated,\' they say: \'he has a very pretty collection\r\nof old snuff-boxes.\' The collection is all that\'s wanted to make it\r\npitiful. I\'m tired of the sound of the word; I think it\'s grotesque.\r\nWith the poor old father it\'s different; he has his identity, and it\'s\r\nrather a massive one. He represents a great financial house, and that,\r\nin our day, is as good as anything else. For an American, at any rate,\r\nthat will do very well. But I persist in thinking your cousin very lucky\r\nto have a chronic malady so long as he doesn\'t die of it. It\'s much\r\nbetter than the snuffboxes. If he weren\'t ill, you say, he\'d do\r\nsomething?--he\'d take his father\'s place in the house. My poor child, I\r\ndoubt it; I don\'t think he\'s at all fond of the house. However, you know\r\nhim better than I, though I used to know him rather well, and he may\r\nhave the benefit of the doubt. The worst case, I think, is a friend\r\nof mine, a countryman of ours, who lives in Italy (where he also was\r\nbrought before he knew better), and who is one of the most delightful\r\nmen I know. Some day you must know him. I\'ll bring you together and then\r\nyou\'ll see what I mean. He\'s Gilbert Osmond--he lives in Italy; that\'s\r\nall one can say about him or make of him. He\'s exceedingly clever, a\r\nman made to be distinguished; but, as I tell you, you exhaust the\r\ndescription when you say he\'s Mr. Osmond who lives _tout b\xeatement_ in\r\nItaly. No career, no name, no position, no fortune, no past, no future,\r\nno anything. Oh yes, he paints, if you please--paints in water-colours;\r\nlike me, only better than I. His painting\'s pretty bad; on the whole I\'m\r\nrather glad of that. Fortunately he\'s very indolent, so indolent that\r\nit amounts to a sort of position. He can say, \'Oh, I do nothing; I\'m too\r\ndeadly lazy. You can do nothing to-day unless you get up at five o\'clock\r\nin the morning.\' In that way he becomes a sort of exception; you feel\r\nhe might do something if he\'d only rise early. He never speaks of his\r\npainting to people at large; he\'s too clever for that. But he has a\r\nlittle girl--a dear little girl; he does speak of her. He\'s devoted\r\nto her, and if it were a career to be an excellent father he\'d be very\r\ndistinguished. But I\'m afraid that\'s no better than the snuff-boxes;\r\nperhaps not even so good. Tell me what they do in America," pursued\r\nMadame Merle, who, it must be observed parenthetically, did not deliver\r\nherself all at once of these reflexions, which are presented in a\r\ncluster for the convenience of the reader. She talked of Florence, where\r\nMr. Osmond lived and where Mrs. Touchett occupied a medieval palace; she\r\ntalked of Rome, where she herself had a little _pied-\xe0-terre_ with some\r\nrather good old damask. She talked of places, of people and even, as the\r\nphrase is, of "subjects"; and from time to time she talked of their kind\r\nold host and of the prospect of his recovery. From the first she\r\nhad thought this prospect small, and Isabel had been struck with the\r\npositive, discriminating, competent way in which she took the measure\r\nof his remainder of life. One evening she announced definitely that he\r\nwouldn\'t live.\r\n\r\n"Sir Matthew Hope told me so as plainly as was proper," she said;\r\n"standing there, near the fire, before dinner. He makes himself very\r\nagreeable, the great doctor. I don\'t mean his saying that has anything\r\nto do with it. But he says such things with great tact. I had told him\r\nI felt ill at my ease, staying here at such a time; it seemed to me so\r\nindiscreet--it wasn\'t as if I could nurse. \'You must remain, you must\r\nremain,\' he answered; \'your office will come later.\' Wasn\'t that a very\r\ndelicate way of saying both that poor Mr. Touchett would go and that I\r\nmight be of some use as a consoler? In fact, however, I shall not be of\r\nthe slightest use. Your aunt will console herself; she, and she alone,\r\nknows just how much consolation she\'ll require. It would be a very\r\ndelicate matter for another person to undertake to administer the dose.\r\nWith your cousin it will be different; he\'ll miss his father immensely.\r\nBut I should never presume to condole with Mr. Ralph; we\'re not on\r\nthose terms." Madame Merle had alluded more than once to some undefined\r\nincongruity in her relations with Ralph Touchett; so Isabel took this\r\noccasion of asking her if they were not good friends.\r\n\r\n"Perfectly, but he doesn\'t like me."\r\n\r\n"What have you done to him?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing whatever. But one has no need of a reason for that."\r\n\r\n"For not liking you? I think one has need of a very good reason."\r\n\r\n"You\'re very kind. Be sure you have one ready for the day you begin."\r\n\r\n"Begin to dislike you? I shall never begin."\r\n\r\n"I hope not; because if you do you\'ll never end. That\'s the way with\r\nyour cousin; he doesn\'t get over it. It\'s an antipathy of nature--if\r\nI can call it that when it\'s all on his side. I\'ve nothing whatever\r\nagainst him and don\'t bear him the least little grudge for not doing me\r\njustice. Justice is all I want. However, one feels that he\'s a gentleman\r\nand would never say anything underhand about one. _Cartes sur table_,"\r\nMadame Merle subjoined in a moment, "I\'m not afraid of him."\r\n\r\n"I hope not indeed," said Isabel, who added something about his being\r\nthe kindest creature living. She remembered, however, that on her first\r\nasking him about Madame Merle he had answered her in a manner which\r\nthis lady might have thought injurious without being explicit. There\r\nwas something between them, Isabel said to herself, but she said nothing\r\nmore than this. If it were something of importance it should inspire\r\nrespect; if it were not it was not worth her curiosity. With all her\r\nlove of knowledge she had a natural shrinking from raising curtains and\r\nlooking into unlighted corners. The love of knowledge coexisted in her\r\nmind with the finest capacity for ignorance.\r\n\r\nBut Madame Merle sometimes said things that startled her, made her raise\r\nher clear eyebrows at the time and think of the words afterwards. "I\'d\r\ngive a great deal to be your age again," she broke out once with a\r\nbitterness which, though diluted in her customary amplitude of ease, was\r\nimperfectly disguised by it. "If I could only begin again--if I could\r\nhave my life before me!"\r\n\r\n"Your life\'s before you yet," Isabel answered gently, for she was\r\nvaguely awe-struck.\r\n\r\n"No; the best part\'s gone, and gone for nothing."\r\n\r\n"Surely not for nothing," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"Why not--what have I got? Neither husband, nor child, nor fortune, nor\r\nposition, nor the traces of a beauty that I never had."\r\n\r\n"You have many friends, dear lady."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not so sure!" cried Madame Merle.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you\'re wrong. You have memories, graces, talents--"\r\n\r\nBut Madame Merle interrupted her. "What have my talents brought me?\r\nNothing but the need of using them still, to get through the hours,\r\nthe years, to cheat myself with some pretence of movement, of\r\nunconsciousness. As for my graces and memories the less said about them\r\nthe better. You\'ll be my friend till you find a better use for your\r\nfriendship."\r\n\r\n"It will be for you to see that I don\'t then," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I would make an effort to keep you." And her companion looked at\r\nher gravely. "When I say I should like to be your age I mean with your\r\nqualities--frank, generous, sincere like you. In that case I should have\r\nmade something better of my life."\r\n\r\n"What should you have liked to do that you\'ve not done?"\r\n\r\nMadame Merle took a sheet of music--she was seated at the piano and\r\nhad abruptly wheeled about on the stool when she first spoke--and\r\nmechanically turned the leaves. "I\'m very ambitious!" she at last\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n"And your ambitions have not been satisfied? They must have been great."\r\n\r\n"They _were_ great. I should make myself ridiculous by talking of them."\r\n\r\nIsabel wondered what they could have been--whether Madame Merle had\r\naspired to wear a crown. "I don\'t know what your idea of success may be,\r\nbut you seem to me to have been successful. To me indeed you\'re a vivid\r\nimage of success."\r\n\r\nMadame Merle tossed away the music with a smile. "What\'s _your_ idea of\r\nsuccess?"\r\n\r\n"You evidently think it must be a very tame one. It\'s to see some dream\r\nof one\'s youth come true."\r\n\r\n"Ah," Madame Merle exclaimed, "that I\'ve never seen! But my dreams were\r\nso great--so preposterous. Heaven forgive me, I\'m dreaming now!" And she\r\nturned back to the piano and began grandly to play. On the morrow she\r\nsaid to Isabel that her definition of success had been very pretty,\r\nyet frightfully sad. Measured in that way, who had ever succeeded? The\r\ndreams of one\'s youth, why they were enchanting, they were divine! Who\r\nhad ever seen such things come to pass?\r\n\r\n"I myself--a few of them," Isabel ventured to answer.\r\n\r\n"Already? They must have been dreams of yesterday."\r\n\r\n"I began to dream very young," Isabel smiled.\r\n\r\n"Ah, if you mean the aspirations of your childhood--that of having a\r\npink sash and a doll that could close her eyes."\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t mean that."\r\n\r\n"Or a young man with a fine moustache going down on his knees to you."\r\n\r\n"No, nor that either," Isabel declared with still more emphasis.\r\n\r\nMadame Merle appeared to note this eagerness. "I suspect that\'s what\r\nyou do mean. We\'ve all had the young man with the moustache. He\'s the\r\ninevitable young man; he doesn\'t count."\r\n\r\nIsabel was silent a little but then spoke with extreme and\r\ncharacteristic inconsequence. "Why shouldn\'t he count? There are young\r\nmen and young men."\r\n\r\n"And yours was a paragon--is that what you mean?" asked her friend with\r\na laugh. "If you\'ve had the identical young man you dreamed of, then\r\nthat was success, and I congratulate you with all my heart. Only in that\r\ncase why didn\'t you fly with him to his castle in the Apennines?"\r\n\r\n"He has no castle in the Apennines."\r\n\r\n"What has he? An ugly brick house in Fortieth Street? Don\'t tell me\r\nthat; I refuse to recognise that as an ideal."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care anything about his house," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"That\'s very crude of you. When you\'ve lived as long as I you\'ll see\r\nthat every human being has his shell and that you must take the shell\r\ninto account. By the shell I mean the whole envelope of circumstances.\r\nThere\'s no such thing as an isolated man or woman; we\'re each of us\r\nmade up of some cluster of appurtenances. What shall we call our \'self\'?\r\nWhere does it begin? where does it end? It overflows into everything\r\nthat belongs to us--and then it flows back again. I know a large part\r\nof myself is in the clothes I choose to wear. I\'ve a great respect for\r\n_things_! One\'s self--for other people--is one\'s expression of one\'s self;\r\nand one\'s house, one\'s furniture, one\'s garments, the books one reads,\r\nthe company one keeps--these things are all expressive."\r\n\r\nThis was very metaphysical; not more so, however, than several\r\nobservations Madame Merle had already made. Isabel was fond of\r\nmetaphysics, but was unable to accompany her friend into this bold\r\nanalysis of the human personality. "I don\'t agree with you. I think just\r\nthe other way. I don\'t know whether I succeed in expressing myself, but\r\nI know that nothing else expresses me. Nothing that belongs to me is any\r\nmeasure of me; everything\'s on the contrary a limit, a barrier, and\r\na perfectly arbitrary one. Certainly the clothes which, as you say, I\r\nchoose to wear, don\'t express me; and heaven forbid they should!"\r\n\r\n"You dress very well," Madame Merle lightly interposed.\r\n\r\n"Possibly; but I don\'t care to be judged by that. My clothes may express\r\nthe dressmaker, but they don\'t express me. To begin with it\'s not my own\r\nchoice that I wear them; they\'re imposed upon me by society."\r\n\r\n"Should you prefer to go without them?" Madame Merle enquired in a tone\r\nwhich virtually terminated the discussion.\r\n\r\nI am bound to confess, though it may cast some discredit on the sketch I\r\nhave given of the youthful loyalty practised by our heroine toward this\r\naccomplished woman, that Isabel had said nothing whatever to her about\r\nLord Warburton and had been equally reticent on the subject of Caspar\r\nGoodwood. She had not, however, concealed the fact that she had had\r\nopportunities of marrying and had even let her friend know of how\r\nadvantageous a kind they had been. Lord Warburton had left Lockleigh\r\nand was gone to Scotland, taking his sisters with him; and though he had\r\nwritten to Ralph more than once to ask about Mr. Touchett\'s health the\r\ngirl was not liable to the embarrassment of such enquiries as, had he\r\nstill been in the neighbourhood, he would probably have felt bound to\r\nmake in person. He had excellent ways, but she felt sure that if he had\r\ncome to Gardencourt he would have seen Madame Merle, and that if he had\r\nseen her he would have liked her and betrayed to her that he was in love\r\nwith her young friend. It so happened that during this lady\'s previous\r\nvisits to Gardencourt--each of them much shorter than the present--he\r\nhad either not been at Lockleigh or had not called at Mr. Touchett\'s.\r\nTherefore, though she knew him by name as the great man of that\r\ncounty, she had no cause to suspect him as a suitor of Mrs. Touchett\'s\r\nfreshly-imported niece.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve plenty of time," she had said to Isabel in return for the\r\nmutilated confidences which our young woman made her and which didn\'t\r\npretend to be perfect, though we have seen that at moments the girl\r\nhad compunctions at having said so much. "I\'m glad you\'ve done nothing\r\nyet--that you have it still to do. It\'s a very good thing for a girl to\r\nhave refused a few good offers--so long of course as they are not the\r\nbest she\'s likely to have. Pardon me if my tone seems horribly corrupt;\r\none must take the worldly view sometimes. Only don\'t keep on refusing\r\nfor the sake of refusing. It\'s a pleasant exercise of power; but\r\naccepting\'s after all an exercise of power as well. There\'s always the\r\ndanger of refusing once too often. It was not the one I fell into--I\r\ndidn\'t refuse often enough. You\'re an exquisite creature, and I should\r\nlike to see you married to a prime minister. But speaking strictly, you\r\nknow, you\'re not what is technically called a _parti_. You\'re extremely\r\ngood-looking and extremely clever; in yourself you\'re quite exceptional.\r\nYou appear to have the vaguest ideas about your earthly possessions; but\r\nfrom what I can make out you\'re not embarrassed with an income. I wish\r\nyou had a little money."\r\n\r\n"I wish I had!" said Isabel, simply, apparently forgetting for the\r\nmoment that her poverty had been a venial fault for two gallant\r\ngentlemen.\r\n\r\nIn spite of Sir Matthew Hope\'s benevolent recommendation Madame Merle\r\ndid not remain to the end, as the issue of poor Mr. Touchett\'s malady\r\nhad now come frankly to be designated. She was under pledges to other\r\npeople which had at last to be redeemed, and she left Gardencourt with\r\nthe understanding that she should in any event see Mrs. Touchett there\r\nagain, or else in town, before quitting England. Her parting with Isabel\r\nwas even more like the beginning of a friendship than their meeting had\r\nbeen. "I\'m going to six places in succession, but I shall see no one I\r\nlike so well as you. They\'ll all be old friends, however; one doesn\'t\r\nmake new friends at my age. I\'ve made a great exception for you. You\r\nmust remember that and must think as well of me as possible. You must\r\nreward me by believing in me."\r\n\r\nBy way of answer Isabel kissed her, and, though some women kiss with\r\nfacility, there are kisses and kisses, and this embrace was satisfactory\r\nto Madame Merle. Our young lady, after this, was much alone; she saw her\r\naunt and cousin only at meals, and discovered that of the hours during\r\nwhich Mrs. Touchett was invisible only a minor portion was now devoted\r\nto nursing her husband. She spent the rest in her own apartments, to\r\nwhich access was not allowed even to her niece, apparently occupied\r\nthere with mysterious and inscrutable exercises. At table she was grave\r\nand silent; but her solemnity was not an attitude--Isabel could see it\r\nwas a conviction. She wondered if her aunt repented of having taken her\r\nown way so much; but there was no visible evidence of this--no tears, no\r\nsighs, no exaggeration of a zeal always to its own sense adequate. Mrs.\r\nTouchett seemed simply to feel the need of thinking things over and\r\nsumming them up; she had a little moral account-book--with columns\r\nunerringly ruled and a sharp steel clasp--which she kept with exemplary\r\nneatness. Uttered reflection had with her ever, at any rate, a practical\r\nring. "If I had foreseen this I\'d not have proposed your coming abroad\r\nnow," she said to Isabel after Madame Merle had left the house. "I\'d\r\nhave waited and sent for you next year."\r\n\r\n"So that perhaps I should never have known my uncle? It\'s a great\r\nhappiness to me to have come now."\r\n\r\n"That\'s very well. But it was not that you might know your uncle that\r\nI brought you to Europe." A perfectly veracious speech; but, as Isabel\r\nthought, not as perfectly timed. She had leisure to think of this and\r\nother matters. She took a solitary walk every day and spent vague hours\r\nin turning over books in the library. Among the subjects that engaged\r\nher attention were the adventures of her friend Miss Stackpole, with\r\nwhom she was in regular correspondence. Isabel liked her friend\'s\r\nprivate epistolary style better than her public; that is she felt her\r\npublic letters would have been excellent if they had not been printed.\r\nHenrietta\'s career, however, was not so successful as might have been\r\nwished even in the interest of her private felicity; that view of the\r\ninner life of Great Britain which she was so eager to take appeared to\r\ndance before her like an _ignis fatuus_. The invitation from Lady Pensil,\r\nfor mysterious reasons, had never arrived; and poor Mr. Bantling\r\nhimself, with all his friendly ingenuity, had been unable to explain\r\nso grave a dereliction on the part of a missive that had obviously been\r\nsent. He had evidently taken Henrietta\'s affairs much to heart,\r\nand believed that he owed her a set-off to this illusory visit to\r\nBedfordshire. "He says he should think I would go to the Continent,"\r\nHenrietta wrote; "and as he thinks of going there himself I suppose his\r\nadvice is sincere. He wants to know why I don\'t take a view of French\r\nlife; and it\'s a fact that I want very much to see the new Republic. Mr.\r\nBantling doesn\'t care much about the Republic, but he thinks of going\r\nover to Paris anyway. I must say he\'s quite as attentive as I could\r\nwish, and at least I shall have seen one polite Englishman. I keep\r\ntelling Mr. Bantling that he ought to have been an American, and you\r\nshould see how that pleases him. Whenever I say so he always breaks out\r\nwith the same exclamation--\'Ah, but really, come now!" A few days later\r\nshe wrote that she had decided to go to Paris at the end of the week and\r\nthat Mr. Bantling had promised to see her off--perhaps even would go\r\nas far as Dover with her. She would wait in Paris till Isabel should\r\narrive, Henrietta added; speaking quite as if Isabel were to start on\r\nher continental journey alone and making no allusion to Mrs. Touchett.\r\nBearing in mind his interest in their late companion, our heroine\r\ncommunicated several passages from this correspondence to Ralph,\r\nwho followed with an emotion akin to suspense the career of the\r\nrepresentative of the _Interviewer_.\r\n\r\n"It seems to me she\'s doing very well," he said, "going over to Paris\r\nwith an ex-Lancer! If she wants something to write about she has only to\r\ndescribe that episode."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not conventional, certainly," Isabel answered; "but if you mean\r\nthat--as far as Henrietta is concerned--it\'s not perfectly innocent,\r\nyou\'re very much mistaken. You\'ll never understand Henrietta."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me, I understand her perfectly. I didn\'t at all at first, but\r\nnow I\'ve the point of view. I\'m afraid, however, that Bantling hasn\'t;\r\nhe may have some surprises. Oh, I understand Henrietta as well as if I\r\nhad made her!"\r\n\r\nIsabel was by no means sure of this, but she abstained from expressing\r\nfurther doubt, for she was disposed in these days to extend a great\r\ncharity to her cousin. One afternoon less than a week after Madame\r\nMerle\'s departure she was seated in the library with a volume to\r\nwhich her attention was not fastened. She had placed herself in a deep\r\nwindow-bench, from which she looked out into the dull, damp park; and as\r\nthe library stood at right angles to the entrance-front of the house she\r\ncould see the doctor\'s brougham, which had been waiting for the last two\r\nhours before the door. She was struck with his remaining so long, but at\r\nlast she saw him appear in the portico, stand a moment slowly drawing on\r\nhis gloves and looking at the knees of his horse, and then get into the\r\nvehicle and roll away. Isabel kept her place for half an hour; there was\r\na great stillness in the house. It was so great that when she at last\r\nheard a soft, slow step on the deep carpet of the room she was almost\r\nstartled by the sound. She turned quickly away from the window and saw\r\nRalph Touchett standing there with his hands still in his pockets, but\r\nwith a face absolutely void of its usual latent smile. She got up and\r\nher movement and glance were a question.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all over," said Ralph.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that my uncle...?" And Isabel stopped.\r\n\r\n"My dear father died an hour ago."\r\n\r\n"Ah, my poor Ralph!" she gently wailed, putting out her two hands to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nSome fortnight after this Madame Merle drove up in a hansom cab to\r\nthe house in Winchester Square. As she descended from her vehicle she\r\nobserved, suspended between the dining-room windows, a large, neat,\r\nwooden tablet, on whose fresh black ground were inscribed in white paint\r\nthe words--"This noble freehold mansion to be sold"; with the name of\r\nthe agent to whom application should be made. "They certainly lose no\r\ntime," said the visitor as, after sounding the big brass knocker, she\r\nwaited to be admitted; "it\'s a practical country!" And within the house,\r\nas she ascended to the drawing-room, she perceived numerous signs of\r\nabdication; pictures removed from the walls and placed upon sofas,\r\nwindows undraped and floors laid bare. Mrs. Touchett presently received\r\nher and intimated in a few words that condolences might be taken for\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\n"I know what you\'re going to say--he was a very good man. But I know it\r\nbetter than any one, because I gave him more chance to show it. In that\r\nI think I was a good wife." Mrs. Touchett added that at the end her\r\nhusband apparently recognised this fact. "He has treated me most\r\nliberally," she said; "I won\'t say more liberally than I expected,\r\nbecause I didn\'t expect. You know that as a general thing I don\'t\r\nexpect. But he chose, I presume, to recognise the fact that though I\r\nlived much abroad and mingled--you may say freely--in foreign life, I\r\nnever exhibited the smallest preference for any one else."\r\n\r\n"For any one but yourself," Madame Merle mentally observed; but the\r\nreflexion was perfectly inaudible.\r\n\r\n"I never sacrificed my husband to another," Mrs. Touchett continued with\r\nher stout curtness.\r\n\r\n"Oh no," thought Madame Merle; "you never did anything for another!"\r\n\r\nThere was a certain cynicism in these mute comments which demands an\r\nexplanation; the more so as they are not in accord either with the\r\nview--somewhat superficial perhaps--that we have hitherto enjoyed of\r\nMadame Merle\'s character or with the literal facts of Mrs. Touchett\'s\r\nhistory; the more so, too, as Madame Merle had a well-founded conviction\r\nthat her friend\'s last remark was not in the least to be construed as a\r\nside-thrust at herself. The truth is that the moment she had crossed the\r\nthreshold she received an impression that Mr. Touchett\'s death had had\r\nsubtle consequences and that these consequences had been profitable to\r\na little circle of persons among whom she was not numbered. Of course\r\nit was an event which would naturally have consequences; her imagination\r\nhad more than once rested upon this fact during her stay at Gardencourt.\r\nBut it had been one thing to foresee such a matter mentally and another\r\nto stand among its massive records. The idea of a distribution of\r\nproperty--she would almost have said of spoils--just now pressed upon\r\nher senses and irritated her with a sense of exclusion. I am far from\r\nwishing to picture her as one of the hungry mouths or envious hearts of\r\nthe general herd, but we have already learned of her having desires\r\nthat had never been satisfied. If she had been questioned, she would\r\nof course have admitted--with a fine proud smile--that she had not the\r\nfaintest claim to a share in Mr. Touchett\'s relics. "There was never\r\nanything in the world between us," she would have said. "There was never\r\nthat, poor man!"--with a fillip of her thumb and her third finger. I\r\nhasten to add, moreover, that if she couldn\'t at the present moment keep\r\nfrom quite perversely yearning she was careful not to betray herself.\r\nShe had after all as much sympathy for Mrs. Touchett\'s gains as for her\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\n"He has left me this house," the newly-made widow said; "but of course\r\nI shall not live in it; I\'ve a much better one in Florence. The will\r\nwas opened only three days since, but I\'ve already offered the house for\r\nsale. I\'ve also a share in the bank; but I don\'t yet understand if I\'m\r\nobliged to leave it there. If not I shall certainly take it out. Ralph,\r\nof course, has Gardencourt; but I\'m not sure that he\'ll have means to\r\nkeep up the place. He\'s naturally left very well off, but his father has\r\ngiven away an immense deal of money; there are bequests to a string of\r\nthird cousins in Vermont. Ralph, however, is very fond of Gardencourt\r\nand would be quite capable of living there--in summer--with a\r\nmaid-of-all-work and a gardener\'s boy. There\'s one remarkable clause\r\nin my husband\'s will," Mrs. Touchett added. "He has left my niece a\r\nfortune."\r\n\r\n"A fortune!" Madame Merle softly repeated.\r\n\r\n"Isabel steps into something like seventy thousand pounds." Madame\r\nMerle\'s hands were clasped in her lap; at this she raised them, still\r\nclasped, and held them a moment against her bosom while her eyes, a\r\nlittle dilated, fixed themselves on those of her friend. "Ah," she\r\ncried, "the clever creature!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Touchett gave her a quick look. "What do you mean by that?"\r\n\r\nFor an instant Madame Merle\'s colour rose and she dropped her eyes. "It\r\ncertainly is clever to achieve such results--without an effort!"\r\n\r\n"There assuredly was no effort. Don\'t call it an achievement."\r\n\r\nMadame Merle was seldom guilty of the awkwardness of retracting what she\r\nhad said; her wisdom was shown rather in maintaining it and placing it\r\nin a favourable light. "My dear friend, Isabel would certainly not\r\nhave had seventy thousand pounds left her if she had not been the most\r\ncharming girl in the world. Her charm includes great cleverness."\r\n\r\n"She never dreamed, I\'m sure, of my husband\'s doing anything for her;\r\nand I never dreamed of it either, for he never spoke to me of his\r\nintention," Mrs. Touchett said. "She had no claim upon him whatever; it\r\nwas no great recommendation to him that she was my niece. Whatever she\r\nachieved she achieved unconsciously."\r\n\r\n"Ah," rejoined Madame Merle, "those are the greatest strokes!" Mrs.\r\nTouchett reserved her opinion. "The girl\'s fortunate; I don\'t deny that.\r\nBut for the present she\'s simply stupefied."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that she doesn\'t know what to do with the money?"\r\n\r\n"That, I think, she has hardly considered. She doesn\'t know what to\r\nthink about the matter at all. It has been as if a big gun were suddenly\r\nfired off behind her; she\'s feeling herself to see if she be hurt. It\'s\r\nbut three days since she received a visit from the principal executor,\r\nwho came in person, very gallantly, to notify her. He told me afterwards\r\nthat when he had made his little speech she suddenly burst into tears.\r\nThe money\'s to remain in the affairs of the bank, and she\'s to draw the\r\ninterest."\r\n\r\nMadame Merle shook her head with a wise and now quite benignant smile.\r\n"How very delicious! After she has done that two or three times she\'ll\r\nget used to it." Then after a silence, "What does your son think of it?"\r\nshe abruptly asked.\r\n\r\n"He left England before the will was read--used up by his fatigue and\r\nanxiety and hurrying off to the south. He\'s on his way to the Riviera\r\nand I\'ve not yet heard from him. But it\'s not likely he\'ll ever object\r\nto anything done by his father."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you say his own share had been cut down?"\r\n\r\n"Only at his wish. I know that he urged his father to do something for\r\nthe people in America. He\'s not in the least addicted to looking after\r\nnumber one."\r\n\r\n"It depends upon whom he regards as number one!" said Madame Merle. And\r\nshe remained thoughtful a moment, her eyes bent on the floor.\r\n\r\n"Am I not to see your happy niece?" she asked at last as she raised\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"You may see her; but you\'ll not be struck with her being happy. She\r\nhas looked as solemn, these three days, as a Cimabue Madonna!" And Mrs.\r\nTouchett rang for a servant.\r\n\r\nIsabel came in shortly after the footman had been sent to call her; and\r\nMadame Merle thought, as she appeared, that Mrs. Touchett\'s comparison\r\nhad its force. The girl was pale and grave--an effect not mitigated by\r\nher deeper mourning; but the smile of her brightest moments came into\r\nher face as she saw Madame Merle, who went forward, laid her hand on our\r\nheroine\'s shoulder and, after looking at her a moment, kissed her as if\r\nshe were returning the kiss she had received from her at Gardencourt.\r\nThis was the only allusion the visitor, in her great good taste, made\r\nfor the present to her young friend\'s inheritance.\r\n\r\nMrs. Touchett had no purpose of awaiting in London the sale of her\r\nhouse. After selecting from among its furniture the objects she wished\r\nto transport to her other abode, she left the rest of its contents to be\r\ndisposed of by the auctioneer and took her departure for the Continent.\r\nShe was of course accompanied on this journey by her niece, who now had\r\nplenty of leisure to measure and weigh and otherwise handle the windfall\r\non which Madame Merle had covertly congratulated her. Isabel thought\r\nvery often of the fact of her accession of means, looking at it in a\r\ndozen different lights; but we shall not now attempt to follow her train\r\nof thought or to explain exactly why her new consciousness was at first\r\noppressive. This failure to rise to immediate joy was indeed but brief;\r\nthe girl presently made up her mind that to be rich was a virtue because\r\nit was to be able to do, and that to do could only be sweet. It was\r\nthe graceful contrary of the stupid side of weakness--especially the\r\nfeminine variety. To be weak was, for a delicate young person, rather\r\ngraceful, but, after all, as Isabel said to herself, there was a larger\r\ngrace than that. Just now, it is true, there was not much to do--once\r\nshe had sent off a cheque to Lily and another to poor Edith; but she was\r\nthankful for the quiet months which her mourning robes and her aunt\'s\r\nfresh widowhood compelled them to spend together. The acquisition of\r\npower made her serious; she scrutinised her power with a kind of tender\r\nferocity, but was not eager to exercise it. She began to do so during\r\na stay of some weeks which she eventually made with her aunt in Paris,\r\nthough in ways that will inevitably present themselves as trivial. They\r\nwere the ways most naturally imposed in a city in which the shops are\r\nthe admiration of the world, and that were prescribed unreservedly by\r\nthe guidance of Mrs. Touchett, who took a rigidly practical view of the\r\ntransformation of her niece from a poor girl to a rich one. "Now that\r\nyou\'re a young woman of fortune you must know how to play the part--I\r\nmean to play it well," she said to Isabel once for all; and she added\r\nthat the girl\'s first duty was to have everything handsome. "You don\'t\r\nknow how to take care of your things, but you must learn," she went on;\r\nthis was Isabel\'s second duty. Isabel submitted, but for the present\r\nher imagination was not kindled; she longed for opportunities, but these\r\nwere not the opportunities she meant.\r\n\r\nMrs. Touchett rarely changed her plans, and, having intended before her\r\nhusband\'s death to spend a part of the winter in Paris, saw no reason to\r\ndeprive herself--still less to deprive her companion--of this advantage.\r\nThough they would live in great retirement she might still present\r\nher niece, informally, to the little circle of her fellow countrymen\r\ndwelling upon the skirts of the Champs Elys\xe9es. With many of these\r\namiable colonists Mrs. Touchett was intimate; she shared their\r\nexpatriation, their convictions, their pastimes, their ennui. Isabel\r\nsaw them arrive with a good deal of assiduity at her aunt\'s hotel, and\r\npronounced on them with a trenchancy doubtless to be accounted for by\r\nthe temporary exaltation of her sense of human duty. She made up her\r\nmind that their lives were, though luxurious, inane, and incurred some\r\ndisfavour by expressing this view on bright Sunday afternoons, when the\r\nAmerican absentees were engaged in calling on each other. Though her\r\nlisteners passed for people kept exemplarily genial by their cooks and\r\ndressmakers, two or three of them thought her cleverness, which was\r\ngenerally admitted, inferior to that of the new theatrical pieces. "You\r\nall live here this way, but what does it lead to?" she was pleased to\r\nask. "It doesn\'t seem to lead to anything, and I should think you\'d get\r\nvery tired of it."\r\n\r\nMrs. Touchett thought the question worthy of Henrietta Stackpole. The\r\ntwo ladies had found Henrietta in Paris, and Isabel constantly saw her;\r\nso that Mrs. Touchett had some reason for saying to herself that if her\r\nniece were not clever enough to originate almost anything, she might be\r\nsuspected of having borrowed that style of remark from her journalistic\r\nfriend. The first occasion on which Isabel had spoken was that of\r\na visit paid by the two ladies to Mrs. Luce, an old friend of Mrs.\r\nTouchett\'s and the only person in Paris she now went to see. Mrs. Luce\r\nhad been living in Paris since the days of Louis Philippe; she used to\r\nsay jocosely that she was one of the generation of 1830--a joke of\r\nwhich the point was not always taken. When it failed, Mrs. Luce used to\r\nexplain--"Oh yes, I\'m one of the romantics;" her French had never\r\nbecome quite perfect. She was always at home on Sunday afternoons and\r\nsurrounded by sympathetic compatriots, usually the same. In fact she\r\nwas at home at all times, and reproduced with wondrous truth in her\r\nwell-cushioned little corner of the brilliant city, the domestic tone of\r\nher native Baltimore. This reduced Mr. Luce, her worthy husband, a tall,\r\nlean, grizzled, well-brushed gentleman who wore a gold eye-glass and\r\ncarried his hat a little too much on the back of his head, to mere\r\nplatonic praise of the "distractions" of Paris--they were his great\r\nword--since you would never have guessed from what cares he escaped to\r\nthem. One of them was that he went every day to the American banker\'s,\r\nwhere he found a post-office that was almost as sociable and colloquial\r\nan institution as in an American country town. He passed an hour (in\r\nfine weather) in a chair in the Champs Elys\xe9es, and he dined uncommonly\r\nwell at his own table, seated above a waxed floor which it was Mrs.\r\nLuce\'s happiness to believe had a finer polish than any other in the\r\nFrench capital. Occasionally he dined with a friend or two at the Caf\xe9\r\nAnglais, where his talent for ordering a dinner was a source of felicity\r\nto his companions and an object of admiration even to the headwaiter\r\nof the establishment. These were his only known pastimes, but they had\r\nbeguiled his hours for upwards of half a century, and they doubtless\r\njustified his frequent declaration that there was no place like Paris.\r\nIn no other place, on these terms, could Mr. Luce flatter himself that\r\nhe was enjoying life. There was nothing like Paris, but it must be\r\nconfessed that Mr. Luce thought less highly of this scene of his\r\ndissipations than in earlier days. In the list of his resources his\r\npolitical reflections should not be omitted, for they were doubtless the\r\nanimating principle of many hours that superficially seemed vacant.\r\nLike many of his fellow colonists Mr. Luce was a high--or rather a\r\ndeep--conservative, and gave no countenance to the government lately\r\nestablished in France. He had no faith in its duration and would assure\r\nyou from year to year that its end was close at hand. "They want to be\r\nkept down, sir, to be kept down; nothing but the strong hand--the iron\r\nheel--will do for them," he would frequently say of the French people;\r\nand his ideal of a fine showy clever rule was that of the superseded\r\nEmpire. "Paris is much less attractive than in the days of the Emperor;\r\n_he_ knew how to make a city pleasant," Mr. Luce had often remarked to\r\nMrs. Touchett, who was quite of his own way of thinking and wished to\r\nknow what one had crossed that odious Atlantic for but to get away from\r\nrepublics.\r\n\r\n"Why, madam, sitting in the Champs Elys\xe9es, opposite to the Palace of\r\nIndustry, I\'ve seen the court-carriages from the Tuileries pass up and\r\ndown as many as seven times a day. I remember one occasion when they\r\nwent as high as nine. What do you see now? It\'s no use talking, the\r\nstyle\'s all gone. Napoleon knew what the French people want, and\r\nthere\'ll be a dark cloud over Paris, our Paris, till they get the Empire\r\nback again."\r\n\r\nAmong Mrs. Luce\'s visitors on Sunday afternoons was a young man with\r\nwhom Isabel had had a good deal of conversation and whom she found\r\nfull of valuable knowledge. Mr. Edward Rosier--Ned Rosier as he was\r\ncalled--was native to New York and had been brought up in Paris, living\r\nthere under the eye of his father who, as it happened, had been an early\r\nand intimate friend of the late Mr. Archer. Edward Rosier remembered\r\nIsabel as a little girl; it had been his father who came to the rescue\r\nof the small Archers at the inn at Neufchatel (he was travelling that\r\nway with the boy and had stopped at the hotel by chance), after their\r\n_bonne_ had gone off with the Russian prince and when Mr. Archer\'s\r\nwhereabouts remained for some days a mystery. Isabel remembered\r\nperfectly the neat little male child whose hair smelt of a delicious\r\ncosmetic and who had a _bonne_ all his own, warranted to lose sight of him\r\nunder no provocation. Isabel took a walk with the pair beside the lake\r\nand thought little Edward as pretty as an angel--a comparison by no\r\nmeans conventional in her mind, for she had a very definite conception\r\nof a type of features which she supposed to be angelic and which her\r\nnew friend perfectly illustrated. A small pink face surmounted by a blue\r\nvelvet bonnet and set off by a stiff embroidered collar had become the\r\ncountenance of her childish dreams; and she had firmly believed for some\r\ntime afterwards that the heavenly hosts conversed among themselves in\r\na queer little dialect of French-English, expressing the properest\r\nsentiments, as when Edward told her that he was "defended" by his _bonne_\r\nto go near the edge of the lake, and that one must always obey to one\'s\r\n_bonne_. Ned Rosier\'s English had improved; at least it exhibited in a\r\nless degree the French variation. His father was dead and his _bonne_\r\ndismissed, but the young man still conformed to the spirit of their\r\nteaching--he never went to the edge of the lake. There was still\r\nsomething agreeable to the nostrils about him and something not\r\noffensive to nobler organs. He was a very gentle and gracious youth,\r\nwith what are called cultivated tastes--an acquaintance with old china,\r\nwith good wine, with the bindings of books, with the _Almanach de Gotha_,\r\nwith the best shops, the best hotels, the hours of railway-trains. He\r\ncould order a dinner almost as well as Mr. Luce, and it was probable\r\nthat as his experience accumulated he would be a worthy successor to\r\nthat gentleman, whose rather grim politics he also advocated in a soft\r\nand innocent voice. He had some charming rooms in Paris, decorated with\r\nold Spanish altar-lace, the envy of his female friends, who declared\r\nthat his chimney-piece was better draped than the high shoulders of many\r\na duchess. He usually, however, spent a part of every winter at Pau, and\r\nhad once passed a couple of months in the United States.\r\n\r\nHe took a great interest in Isabel and remembered perfectly the walk at\r\nNeufchatel, when she would persist in going so near the edge. He seemed\r\nto recognise this same tendency in the subversive enquiry that I quoted\r\na moment ago, and set himself to answer our heroine\'s question with\r\ngreater urbanity than it perhaps deserved. "What does it lead to, Miss\r\nArcher? Why Paris leads everywhere. You can\'t go anywhere unless you\r\ncome here first. Every one that comes to Europe has got to pass through.\r\nYou don\'t mean it in that sense so much? You mean what good it does you?\r\nWell, how can you penetrate futurity? How can you tell what lies ahead?\r\nIf it\'s a pleasant road I don\'t care where it leads. I like the road,\r\nMiss Archer; I like the dear old asphalte. You can\'t get tired of\r\nit--you can\'t if you try. You think you would, but you wouldn\'t;\r\nthere\'s always something new and fresh. Take the H\xf4tel Drouot, now;\r\nthey sometimes have three and four sales a week. Where can you get such\r\nthings as you can here? In spite of all they say I maintain they\'re\r\ncheaper too, if you know the right places. I know plenty of places,\r\nbut I keep them to myself. I\'ll tell you, if you like, as a particular\r\nfavour; only you mustn\'t tell any one else. Don\'t you go anywhere\r\nwithout asking me first; I want you to promise me that. As a general\r\nthing avoid the Boulevards; there\'s very little to be done on the\r\nBoulevards. Speaking conscientiously--_sans blague_--I don\'t believe\r\nany one knows Paris better than I. You and Mrs. Touchett must come and\r\nbreakfast with me some day, and I\'ll show you my things; _je ne vous dis\r\nque \xe7a!_ There has been a great deal of talk about London of late; it\'s\r\nthe fashion to cry up London. But there\'s nothing in it--you can\'t\r\ndo anything in London. No Louis Quinze--nothing of the First Empire;\r\nnothing but their eternal Queen Anne. It\'s good for one\'s bed-room,\r\nQueen Anne--for one\'s washing-room; but it isn\'t proper for a salon. Do\r\nI spend my life at the auctioneer\'s?" Mr. Rosier pursued in answer to\r\nanother question of Isabel\'s. "Oh no; I haven\'t the means. I wish I\r\nhad. You think I\'m a mere trifler; I can tell by the expression of your\r\nface--you\'ve got a wonderfully expressive face. I hope you don\'t mind\r\nmy saying that; I mean it as a kind of warning. You think I ought to do\r\nsomething, and so do I, so long as you leave it vague. But when you\r\ncome to the point you see you have to stop. I can\'t go home and be\r\na shopkeeper. You think I\'m very well fitted? Ah, Miss Archer, you\r\noverrate me. I can buy very well, but I can\'t sell; you should see when\r\nI sometimes try to get rid of my things. It takes much more ability to\r\nmake other people buy than to buy yourself. When I think how clever they\r\nmust be, the people who make _me_ buy! Ah no; I couldn\'t be a shopkeeper.\r\nI can\'t be a doctor; it\'s a repulsive business. I can\'t be a clergyman;\r\nI haven\'t got convictions. And then I can\'t pronounce the names right in\r\nthe Bible. They\'re very difficult, in the Old Testament particularly. I\r\ncan\'t be a lawyer; I don\'t understand--how do you call it?--the American\r\nprocedure. Is there anything else? There\'s nothing for a gentleman\r\nin America. I should like to be a diplomatist; but American\r\ndiplomacy--that\'s not for gentlemen either. I\'m sure if you had seen the\r\nlast min--"\r\n\r\nHenrietta Stackpole, who was often with her friend when Mr. Rosier,\r\ncoming to pay his compliments late in the afternoon, expressed himself\r\nafter the fashion I have sketched, usually interrupted the young man at\r\nthis point and read him a lecture on the duties of the American citizen.\r\nShe thought him most unnatural; he was worse than poor Ralph Touchett.\r\nHenrietta, however, was at this time more than ever addicted to fine\r\ncriticism, for her conscience had been freshly alarmed as regards\r\nIsabel. She had not congratulated this young lady on her augmentations\r\nand begged to be excused from doing so.\r\n\r\n"If Mr. Touchett had consulted me about leaving you the money," she\r\nfrankly asserted, "I\'d have said to him \'Never!"\r\n\r\n"I see," Isabel had answered. "You think it will prove a curse in\r\ndisguise. Perhaps it will."\r\n\r\n"Leave it to some one you care less for--that\'s what I should have\r\nsaid."\r\n\r\n"To yourself for instance?" Isabel suggested jocosely. And then, "Do you\r\nreally believe it will ruin me?" she asked in quite another tone.\r\n\r\n"I hope it won\'t ruin you; but it will certainly confirm your dangerous\r\ntendencies."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean the love of luxury--of extravagance?"\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Henrietta; "I mean your exposure on the moral side. I\r\napprove of luxury; I think we ought to be as elegant as possible. Look\r\nat the luxury of our western cities; I\'ve seen nothing over here to\r\ncompare with it. I hope you\'ll never become grossly sensual; but I\'m not\r\nafraid of that. The peril for you is that you live too much in the world\r\nof your own dreams. You\'re not enough in contact with reality--with\r\nthe toiling, striving, suffering, I may even say sinning, world\r\nthat surrounds you. You\'re too fastidious; you\'ve too many graceful\r\nillusions. Your newly-acquired thousands will shut you up more and\r\nmore to the society of a few selfish and heartless people who will be\r\ninterested in keeping them up."\r\n\r\nIsabel\'s eyes expanded as she gazed at this lurid scene. "What are my\r\nillusions?" she asked. "I try so hard not to have any."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Henrietta, "you think you can lead a romantic life, that\r\nyou can live by pleasing yourself and pleasing others. You\'ll find\r\nyou\'re mistaken. Whatever life you lead you must put your soul in it--to\r\nmake any sort of success of it; and from the moment you do that it\r\nceases to be romance, I assure you: it becomes grim reality! And you\r\ncan\'t always please yourself; you must sometimes please other people.\r\nThat, I admit, you\'re very ready to do; but there\'s another thing that\'s\r\nstill more important--you must often displease others. You must always\r\nbe ready for that--you must never shrink from it. That doesn\'t suit you\r\nat all--you\'re too fond of admiration, you like to be thought well\r\nof. You think we can escape disagreeable duties by taking romantic\r\nviews--that\'s your great illusion, my dear. But we can\'t. You must be\r\nprepared on many occasions in life to please no one at all--not even\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\nIsabel shook her head sadly; she looked troubled and frightened. "This,\r\nfor you, Henrietta," she said, "must be one of those occasions!"\r\n\r\nIt was certainly true that Miss Stackpole, during her visit to Paris,\r\nwhich had been professionally more remunerative than her English\r\nsojourn, had not been living in the world of dreams. Mr. Bantling, who\r\nhad now returned to England, was her companion for the first four weeks\r\nof her stay; and about Mr. Bantling there was nothing dreamy. Isabel\r\nlearned from her friend that the two had led a life of great personal\r\nintimacy and that this had been a peculiar advantage to Henrietta,\r\nowing to the gentleman\'s remarkable knowledge of Paris. He had\r\nexplained everything, shown her everything, been her constant guide and\r\ninterpreter. They had breakfasted together, dined together, gone to\r\nthe theatre together, supped together, really in a manner quite lived\r\ntogether. He was a true friend, Henrietta more than once assured our\r\nheroine; and she had never supposed that she could like any Englishman\r\nso well. Isabel could not have told you why, but she found something\r\nthat ministered to mirth in the alliance the correspondent of the\r\n_Interviewer_ had struck with Lady Pensil\'s brother; her amusement\r\nmoreover subsisted in face of the fact that she thought it a credit to\r\neach of them. Isabel couldn\'t rid herself of a suspicion that they were\r\nplaying somehow at cross-purposes--that the simplicity of each had\r\nbeen entrapped. But this simplicity was on either side none the less\r\nhonourable. It was as graceful on Henrietta\'s part to believe that Mr.\r\nBantling took an interest in the diffusion of lively journalism and in\r\nconsolidating the position of lady-correspondents as it was on the\r\npart of his companion to suppose that the cause of the _Interviewer_--a\r\nperiodical of which he never formed a very definite conception--was, if\r\nsubtly analysed (a task to which Mr. Bantling felt himself quite equal),\r\nbut the cause of Miss Stackpole\'s need of demonstrative affection. Each\r\nof these groping celibates supplied at any rate a want of which the\r\nother was impatiently conscious. Mr. Bantling, who was of rather a slow\r\nand a discursive habit, relished a prompt, keen, positive woman, who\r\ncharmed him by the influence of a shining, challenging eye and a kind of\r\nbandbox freshness, and who kindled a perception of raciness in a mind\r\nto which the usual fare of life seemed unsalted. Henrietta, on the other\r\nhand, enjoyed the society of a gentleman who appeared somehow, in his\r\nway, made, by expensive, roundabout, almost "quaint" processes, for\r\nher use, and whose leisured state, though generally indefensible, was a\r\ndecided boon to a breathless mate, and who was furnished with an easy,\r\ntraditional, though by no means exhaustive, answer to almost any social\r\nor practical question that could come up. She often found Mr. Bantling\'s\r\nanswers very convenient, and in the press of catching the American post\r\nwould largely and showily address them to publicity. It was to be feared\r\nthat she was indeed drifting toward those abysses of sophistication as\r\nto which Isabel, wishing for a good-humoured retort, had warned her.\r\nThere might be danger in store for Isabel; but it was scarcely to be\r\nhoped that Miss Stackpole, on her side, would find permanent rest in any\r\nadoption of the views of a class pledged to all the old abuses. Isabel\r\ncontinued to warn her good-humouredly; Lady Pensil\'s obliging brother\r\nwas sometimes, on our heroine\'s lips, an object of irreverent and\r\nfacetious allusion. Nothing, however, could exceed Henrietta\'s\r\namiability on this point; she used to abound in the sense of Isabel\'s\r\nirony and to enumerate with elation the hours she had spent with this\r\nperfect man of the world--a term that had ceased to make with her, as\r\npreviously, for opprobrium. Then, a few moments later, she would forget\r\nthat they had been talking jocosely and would mention with impulsive\r\nearnestness some expedition she had enjoyed in his company. She would\r\nsay: "Oh, I know all about Versailles; I went there with Mr. Bantling. I\r\nwas bound to see it thoroughly--I warned him when we went out there that\r\nI was thorough: so we spent three days at the hotel and wandered all\r\nover the place. It was lovely weather--a kind of Indian summer, only not\r\nso good. We just lived in that park. Oh yes; you can\'t tell me anything\r\nabout Versailles." Henrietta appeared to have made arrangements to meet\r\nher gallant friend during the spring in Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nMrs. Touchett, before arriving in Paris, had fixed the day for her\r\ndeparture and by the middle of February had begun to travel southward.\r\nShe interrupted her journey to pay a visit to her son, who at San Remo,\r\non the Italian shore of the Mediterranean, had been spending a dull,\r\nbright winter beneath a slow-moving white umbrella. Isabel went with her\r\naunt as a matter of course, though Mrs. Touchett, with homely, customary\r\nlogic, had laid before her a pair of alternatives.\r\n\r\n"Now, of course, you\'re completely your own mistress and are as free as\r\nthe bird on the bough. I don\'t mean you were not so before, but you\'re\r\nat present on a different footing--property erects a kind of barrier.\r\nYou can do a great many things if you\'re rich which would be severely\r\ncriticised if you were poor. You can go and come, you can travel alone,\r\nyou can have your own establishment: I mean of course if you\'ll take\r\na companion--some decayed gentlewoman, with a darned cashmere and dyed\r\nhair, who paints on velvet. You don\'t think you\'d like that? Of course\r\nyou can do as you please; I only want you to understand how much you\'re\r\nat liberty. You might take Miss Stackpole as your _dame de compagnie_;\r\nshe\'d keep people off very well. I think, however, that it\'s a great\r\ndeal better you should remain with me, in spite of there being no\r\nobligation. It\'s better for several reasons, quite apart from your\r\nliking it. I shouldn\'t think you\'d like it, but I recommend you to make\r\nthe sacrifice. Of course whatever novelty there may have been at first\r\nin my society has quite passed away, and you see me as I am--a dull,\r\nobstinate, narrow-minded old woman."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you\'re at all dull," Isabel had replied to this.\r\n\r\n"But you do think I\'m obstinate and narrow-minded? I told you so!" said\r\nMrs. Touchett with much elation at being justified.\r\n\r\nIsabel remained for the present with her aunt, because, in spite of\r\neccentric impulses, she had a great regard for what was usually deemed\r\ndecent, and a young gentlewoman without visible relations had always\r\nstruck her as a flower without foliage. It was true that Mrs. Touchett\'s\r\nconversation had never again appeared so brilliant as that first\r\nafternoon in Albany, when she sat in her damp waterproof and sketched\r\nthe opportunities that Europe would offer to a young person of taste.\r\nThis, however, was in a great measure the girl\'s own fault; she had\r\ngot a glimpse of her aunt\'s experience, and her imagination constantly\r\nanticipated the judgements and emotions of a woman who had very little\r\nof the same faculty. Apart from this, Mrs. Touchett had a great merit;\r\nshe was as honest as a pair of compasses. There was a comfort in her\r\nstiffness and firmness; you knew exactly where to find her and were\r\nnever liable to chance encounters and concussions. On her own ground\r\nshe was perfectly present, but was never over-inquisitive as regards\r\nthe territory of her neighbour. Isabel came at last to have a kind of\r\nundemonstrable pity for her; there seemed something so dreary in\r\nthe condition of a person whose nature had, as it were, so little\r\nsurface--offered so limited a face to the accretions of human contact.\r\nNothing tender, nothing sympathetic, had ever had a chance to fasten\r\nupon it--no wind-sown blossom, no familiar softening moss. Her offered,\r\nher passive extent, in other words, was about that of a knife-edge.\r\nIsabel had reason to believe none the less that as she advanced in life\r\nshe made more of those concessions to the sense of something obscurely\r\ndistinct from convenience--more of them than she independently exacted.\r\nShe was learning to sacrifice consistency to considerations of that\r\ninferior order for which the excuse must be found in the particular\r\ncase. It was not to the credit of her absolute rectitude that she should\r\nhave gone the longest way round to Florence in order to spend a few\r\nweeks with her invalid son; since in former years it had been one of her\r\nmost definite convictions that when Ralph wished to see her he was at\r\nliberty to remember that Palazzo Crescentini contained a large apartment\r\nknown as the quarter of the _signorino_.\r\n\r\n"I want to ask you something," Isabel said to this young man the day\r\nafter her arrival at San Remo--"something I\'ve thought more than once\r\nof asking you by letter, but that I\'ve hesitated on the whole to write\r\nabout. Face to face, nevertheless, my question seems easy enough. Did\r\nyou know your father intended to leave me so much money?"\r\n\r\nRalph stretched his legs a little further than usual and gazed a little\r\nmore fixedly at the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n"What does it matter, my dear Isabel, whether I knew? My father was very\r\nobstinate."\r\n\r\n"So," said the girl, "you did know."\r\n\r\n"Yes; he told me. We even talked it over a little." "What did he do it\r\nfor?" asked Isabel abruptly. "Why, as a kind of compliment."\r\n\r\n"A compliment on what?"\r\n\r\n"On your so beautifully existing."\r\n\r\n"He liked me too much," she presently declared.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a way we all have."\r\n\r\n"If I believed that I should be very unhappy. Fortunately I don\'t\r\nbelieve it. I want to be treated with justice; I want nothing but that."\r\n\r\n"Very good. But you must remember that justice to a lovely being is\r\nafter all a florid sort of sentiment."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not a lovely being. How can you say that, at the very moment when\r\nI\'m asking such odious questions? I must seem to you delicate!"\r\n\r\n"You seem to me troubled," said Ralph.\r\n\r\n"I am troubled."\r\n\r\n"About what?"\r\n\r\nFor a moment she answered nothing; then she broke out: "Do you think it\r\ngood for me suddenly to be made so rich? Henrietta doesn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Oh, hang Henrietta!" said Ralph coarsely, "If you ask me I\'m delighted\r\nat it."\r\n\r\n"Is that why your father did it--for your amusement?"\r\n\r\n"I differ with Miss Stackpole," Ralph went on more gravely. "I think it\r\nvery good for you to have means."\r\n\r\nIsabel looked at him with serious eyes. "I wonder whether you know\r\nwhat\'s good for me--or whether you care."\r\n\r\n"If I know depend upon it I care. Shall I tell you what it is? Not to\r\ntorment yourself."\r\n\r\n"Not to torment you, I suppose you mean."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t do that; I\'m proof. Take things more easily. Don\'t ask\r\nyourself so much whether this or that is good for you. Don\'t question\r\nyour conscience so much--it will get out of tune like a strummed\r\npiano. Keep it for great occasions. Don\'t try so much to form your\r\ncharacter--it\'s like trying to pull open a tight, tender young rose.\r\nLive as you like best, and your character will take care of itself. Most\r\nthings are good for you; the exceptions are very rare, and a comfortable\r\nincome\'s not one of them." Ralph paused, smiling; Isabel had listened\r\nquickly. "You\'ve too much power of thought--above all too much\r\nconscience," Ralph added. "It\'s out of all reason, the number of things\r\nyou think wrong. Put back your watch. Diet your fever. Spread your\r\nwings; rise above the ground. It\'s never wrong to do that."\r\n\r\nShe had listened eagerly, as I say; and it was her nature to understand\r\nquickly. "I wonder if you appreciate what you say. If you do, you take a\r\ngreat responsibility."\r\n\r\n"You frighten me a little, but I think I\'m right," said Ralph,\r\npersisting in cheer.\r\n\r\n"All the same what you say is very true," Isabel pursued. "You could say\r\nnothing more true. I\'m absorbed in myself--I look at life too much as\r\na doctor\'s prescription. Why indeed should we perpetually be thinking\r\nwhether things are good for us, as if we were patients lying in a\r\nhospital? Why should I be so afraid of not doing right? As if it\r\nmattered to the world whether I do right or wrong!"\r\n\r\n"You\'re a capital person to advise," said Ralph; "you take the wind out\r\nof my sails!"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him as if she had not heard him--though she was following\r\nout the train of reflexion which he himself had kindled. "I try to\r\ncare more about the world than about myself--but I always come back to\r\nmyself. It\'s because I\'m afraid." She stopped; her voice had trembled\r\na little. "Yes, I\'m afraid; I can\'t tell you. A large fortune means\r\nfreedom, and I\'m afraid of that. It\'s such a fine thing, and one should\r\nmake such a good use of it. If one shouldn\'t one would be ashamed. And\r\none must keep thinking; it\'s a constant effort. I\'m not sure it\'s not a\r\ngreater happiness to be powerless."\r\n\r\n"For weak people I\'ve no doubt it\'s a greater happiness. For weak people\r\nthe effort not to be contemptible must be great."\r\n\r\n"And how do you know I\'m not weak?" Isabel asked.\r\n\r\n"Ah," Ralph answered with a flush that the girl noticed, "if you are I\'m\r\nawfully sold!"\r\n\r\nThe charm of the Mediterranean coast only deepened for our heroine\r\non acquaintance, for it was the threshold of Italy, the gate of\r\nadmirations. Italy, as yet imperfectly seen and felt, stretched before\r\nher as a land of promise, a land in which a love of the beautiful might\r\nbe comforted by endless knowledge. Whenever she strolled upon the shore\r\nwith her cousin--and she was the companion of his daily walk--she looked\r\nacross the sea, with longing eyes, to where she knew that Genoa lay. She\r\nwas glad to pause, however, on the edge of this larger adventure; there\r\nwas such a thrill even in the preliminary hovering. It affected her\r\nmoreover as a peaceful interlude, as a hush of the drum and fife in a\r\ncareer which she had little warrant as yet for regarding as agitated,\r\nbut which nevertheless she was constantly picturing to herself by\r\nthe light of her hopes, her fears, her fancies, her ambitions, her\r\npredilections, and which reflected these subjective accidents in\r\na manner sufficiently dramatic. Madame Merle had predicted to Mrs.\r\nTouchett that after their young friend had put her hand into her pocket\r\nhalf a dozen times she would be reconciled to the idea that it had been\r\nfilled by a munificent uncle; and the event justified, as it had so\r\noften justified before, that lady\'s perspicacity. Ralph Touchett had\r\npraised his cousin for being morally inflammable, that is for being\r\nquick to take a hint that was meant as good advice. His advice had\r\nperhaps helped the matter; she had at any rate before leaving San Remo\r\ngrown used to feeling rich. The consciousness in question found a\r\nproper place in rather a dense little group of ideas that she had about\r\nherself, and often it was by no means the least agreeable. It took\r\nperpetually for granted a thousand good intentions. She lost herself in\r\na maze of visions; the fine things to be done by a rich, independent,\r\ngenerous girl who took a large human view of occasions and obligations\r\nwere sublime in the mass. Her fortune therefore became to her mind a\r\npart of her better self; it gave her importance, gave her even, to her\r\nown imagination, a certain ideal beauty. What it did for her in the\r\nimagination of others is another affair, and on this point we must also\r\ntouch in time. The visions I have just spoken of were mixed with other\r\ndebates. Isabel liked better to think of the future than of the past;\r\nbut at times, as she listened to the murmur of the Mediterranean waves,\r\nher glance took a backward flight. It rested upon two figures which, in\r\nspite of increasing distance, were still sufficiently salient; they were\r\nrecognisable without difficulty as those of Caspar Goodwood and Lord\r\nWarburton. It was strange how quickly these images of energy had fallen\r\ninto the background of our young lady\'s life. It was in her disposition\r\nat all times to lose faith in the reality of absent things; she could\r\nsummon back her faith, in case of need, with an effort, but the effort\r\nwas often painful even when the reality had been pleasant. The past was\r\napt to look dead and its revival rather to show the livid light of a\r\njudgement-day. The girl moreover was not prone to take for granted that\r\nshe herself lived in the mind of others--she had not the fatuity to\r\nbelieve she left indelible traces. She was capable of being wounded by\r\nthe discovery that she had been forgotten; but of all liberties the one\r\nshe herself found sweetest was the liberty to forget. She had not given\r\nher last shilling, sentimentally speaking, either to Caspar Goodwood or\r\nto Lord Warburton, and yet couldn\'t but feel them appreciably in debt\r\nto her. She had of course reminded herself that she was to hear from Mr.\r\nGoodwood again; but this was not to be for another year and a half, and\r\nin that time a great many things might happen. She had indeed failed to\r\nsay to herself that her American suitor might find some other girl more\r\ncomfortable to woo; because, though it was certain many other girls\r\nwould prove so, she had not the smallest belief that this merit\r\nwould attract him. But she reflected that she herself might know the\r\nhumiliation of change, might really, for that matter, come to the end of\r\nthe things that were not Caspar (even though there appeared so many of\r\nthem), and find rest in those very elements of his presence which struck\r\nher now as impediments to the finer respiration. It was conceivable\r\nthat these impediments should some day prove a sort of blessing\r\nin disguise--a clear and quiet harbour enclosed by a brave granite\r\nbreakwater. But that day could only come in its order, and she couldn\'t\r\nwait for it with folded hands. That Lord Warburton should continue\r\nto cherish her image seemed to her more than a noble humility or an\r\nenlightened pride ought to wish to reckon with. She had so definitely\r\nundertaken to preserve no record of what had passed between them that a\r\ncorresponding effort on his own part would be eminently just. This\r\nwas not, as it may seem, merely a theory tinged with sarcasm. Isabel\r\ncandidly believed that his lordship would, in the usual phrase, get over\r\nhis disappointment. He had been deeply affected--this she believed, and\r\nshe was still capable of deriving pleasure from the belief; but it\r\nwas absurd that a man both so intelligent and so honourably dealt with\r\nshould cultivate a scar out of proportion to any wound. Englishmen\r\nliked moreover to be comfortable, said Isabel, and there could be\r\nlittle comfort for Lord Warburton, in the long run, in brooding over a\r\nself-sufficient American girl who had been but a casual acquaintance.\r\nShe flattered herself that, should she hear from one day to another that\r\nhe had married some young woman of his own country who had done more\r\nto deserve him, she should receive the news without a pang even of\r\nsurprise. It would have proved that he believed she was firm--which was\r\nwhat she wished to seem to him. That alone was grateful to her pride.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nOn one of the first days of May, some six months after old Mr.\r\nTouchett\'s death, a small group that might have been described by a\r\npainter as composing well was gathered in one of the many rooms of an\r\nancient villa crowning an olive-muffled hill outside of the Roman gate\r\nof Florence. The villa was a long, rather blank-looking structure, with\r\nthe far-projecting roof which Tuscany loves and which, on the hills that\r\nencircle Florence, when considered from a distance, makes so harmonious\r\na rectangle with the straight, dark, definite cypresses that usually\r\nrise in groups of three or four beside it. The house had a front upon\r\na little grassy, empty, rural piazza which occupied a part of the\r\nhill-top; and this front, pierced with a few windows in irregular\r\nrelations and furnished with a stone bench lengthily adjusted to the\r\nbase of the structure and useful as a lounging-place to one or two\r\npersons wearing more or less of that air of undervalued merit which in\r\nItaly, for some reason or other, always gracefully invests any one who\r\nconfidently assumes a perfectly passive attitude--this antique,\r\nsolid, weather-worn, yet imposing front had a somewhat incommunicative\r\ncharacter. It was the mask, not the face of the house. It had heavy\r\nlids, but no eyes; the house in reality looked another way--looked off\r\nbehind, into splendid openness and the range of the afternoon light.\r\nIn that quarter the villa overhung the slope of its hill and the long\r\nvalley of the Arno, hazy with Italian colour. It had a narrow garden, in\r\nthe manner of a terrace, productive chiefly of tangles of wild roses\r\nand other old stone benches, mossy and sun-warmed. The parapet of the\r\nterrace was just the height to lean upon, and beneath it the ground\r\ndeclined into the vagueness of olive-crops and vineyards. It is not,\r\nhowever, with the outside of the place that we are concerned; on this\r\nbright morning of ripened spring its tenants had reason to prefer the\r\nshady side of the wall. The windows of the ground-floor, as you saw\r\nthem from the piazza, were, in their noble proportions, extremely\r\narchitectural; but their function seemed less to offer communication\r\nwith the world than to defy the world to look in. They were massively\r\ncross-barred, and placed at such a height that curiosity, even on\r\ntiptoe, expired before it reached them. In an apartment lighted by a\r\nrow of three of these jealous apertures--one of the several distinct\r\napartments into which the villa was divided and which were mainly\r\noccupied by foreigners of random race long resident in Florence--a\r\ngentleman was seated in company with a young girl and two good sisters\r\nfrom a religious house. The room was, however, less sombre than our\r\nindications may have represented, for it had a wide, high door, which\r\nnow stood open into the tangled garden behind; and the tall iron\r\nlattices admitted on occasion more than enough of the Italian\r\nsunshine. It was moreover a seat of ease, indeed of luxury, telling\r\nof arrangements subtly studied and refinements frankly proclaimed, and\r\ncontaining a variety of those faded hangings of damask and tapestry,\r\nthose chests and cabinets of carved and time-polished oak, those angular\r\nspecimens of pictorial art in frames as pedantically primitive, those\r\nperverse-looking relics of medieval brass and pottery, of which Italy\r\nhas long been the not quite exhausted storehouse. These things kept\r\nterms with articles of modern furniture in which large allowance had\r\nbeen made for a lounging generation; it was to be noticed that all the\r\nchairs were deep and well padded and that much space was occupied by a\r\nwriting-table of which the ingenious perfection bore the stamp of London\r\nand the nineteenth century. There were books in profusion and magazines\r\nand newspapers, and a few small, odd, elaborate pictures, chiefly in\r\nwater-colour. One of these productions stood on a drawing-room easel\r\nbefore which, at the moment we begin to be concerned with her, the young\r\ngirl I have mentioned had placed herself. She was looking at the picture\r\nin silence.\r\n\r\nSilence--absolute silence--had not fallen upon her companions; but their\r\ntalk had an appearance of embarrassed continuity. The two good sisters\r\nhad not settled themselves in their respective chairs; their attitude\r\nexpressed a final reserve and their faces showed the glaze of\r\nprudence. They were plain, ample, mild-featured women, with a kind of\r\nbusiness-like modesty to which the impersonal aspect of their stiffened\r\nlinen and of the serge that draped them as if nailed on frames gave an\r\nadvantage. One of them, a person of a certain age, in spectacles, with a\r\nfresh complexion and a full cheek, had a more discriminating manner\r\nthan her colleague, as well as the responsibility of their errand, which\r\napparently related to the young girl. This object of interest wore her\r\nhat--an ornament of extreme simplicity and not at variance with her\r\nplain muslin gown, too short for her years, though it must already\r\nhave been "let out." The gentleman who might have been supposed to be\r\nentertaining the two nuns was perhaps conscious of the difficulties of\r\nhis function, it being in its way as arduous to converse with the very\r\nmeek as with the very mighty. At the same time he was clearly much\r\noccupied with their quiet charge, and while she turned her back to\r\nhim his eyes rested gravely on her slim, small figure. He was a man of\r\nforty, with a high but well-shaped head, on which the hair, still dense,\r\nbut prematurely grizzled, had been cropped close. He had a fine, narrow,\r\nextremely modelled and composed face, of which the only fault was just\r\nthis effect of its running a trifle too much to points; an appearance to\r\nwhich the shape of the beard contributed not a little. This beard, cut\r\nin the manner of the portraits of the sixteenth century and surmounted\r\nby a fair moustache, of which the ends had a romantic upward flourish,\r\ngave its wearer a foreign, traditionary look and suggested that he was a\r\ngentleman who studied style. His conscious, curious eyes, however, eyes\r\nat once vague and penetrating, intelligent and hard, expressive of\r\nthe observer as well as of the dreamer, would have assured you that\r\nhe studied it only within well-chosen limits, and that in so far as he\r\nsought it he found it. You would have been much at a loss to determine\r\nhis original clime and country; he had none of the superficial signs\r\nthat usually render the answer to this question an insipidly easy one.\r\nIf he had English blood in his veins it had probably received some\r\nFrench or Italian commixture; but he suggested, fine gold coin as he\r\nwas, no stamp nor emblem of the common mintage that provides for general\r\ncirculation; he was the elegant complicated medal struck off for a\r\nspecial occasion. He had a light, lean, rather languid-looking figure,\r\nand was apparently neither tall nor short. He was dressed as a man\r\ndresses who takes little other trouble about it than to have no vulgar\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear, what do you think of it?" he asked of the young girl. He\r\nused the Italian tongue, and used it with perfect ease; but this would\r\nnot have convinced you he was Italian.\r\n\r\nThe child turned her head earnestly to one side and the other. "It\'s\r\nvery pretty, papa. Did you make it yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly I made it. Don\'t you think I\'m clever?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa, very clever; I also have learned to make pictures." And\r\nshe turned round and showed a small, fair face painted with a fixed and\r\nintensely sweet smile.\r\n\r\n"You should have brought me a specimen of your powers."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve brought a great many; they\'re in my trunk."\r\n\r\n"She draws very--very carefully," the elder of the nuns remarked,\r\nspeaking in French.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad to hear it. Is it you who have instructed her?"\r\n\r\n"Happily no," said the good sister, blushing a little. "_Ce n\'est pas ma\r\npartie._ I teach nothing; I leave that to those who are wiser. We\'ve an\r\nexcellent drawing-master, Mr.--Mr.--what is his name?" she asked of her\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nHer companion looked about at the carpet. "It\'s a German name," she said\r\nin Italian, as if it needed to be translated.\r\n\r\n"Yes," the other went on, "he\'s a German, and we\'ve had him many years."\r\n\r\nThe young girl, who was not heeding the conversation, had wandered away\r\nto the open door of the large room and stood looking into the garden.\r\n"And you, my sister, are French," said the gentleman.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," the visitor gently replied. "I speak to the pupils in my\r\nown tongue. I know no other. But we have sisters of other\r\ncountries--English, German, Irish. They all speak their proper\r\nlanguage."\r\n\r\nThe gentleman gave a smile. "Has my daughter been under the care of one\r\nof the Irish ladies?" And then, as he saw that his visitors suspected\r\na joke, though failing to understand it, "You\'re very complete," he\r\ninstantly added.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, we\'re complete. We\'ve everything, and everything\'s of the\r\nbest."\r\n\r\n"We have gymnastics," the Italian sister ventured to remark. "But not\r\ndangerous."\r\n\r\n"I hope not. Is that _your_ branch?" A question which provoked much candid\r\nhilarity on the part of the two ladies; on the subsidence of which their\r\nentertainer, glancing at his daughter, remarked that she had grown.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I think she has finished. She\'ll remain--not big," said the\r\nFrench sister.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not sorry. I prefer women like books--very good and not too long.\r\nBut I know," the gentleman said, "no particular reason why my child\r\nshould be short."\r\n\r\nThe nun gave a temperate shrug, as if to intimate that such things might\r\nbe beyond our knowledge. "She\'s in very good health; that\'s the best\r\nthing."\r\n\r\n"Yes, she looks sound." And the young girl\'s father watched her a\r\nmoment. "What do you see in the garden?" he asked in French.\r\n\r\n"I see many flowers," she replied in a sweet, small voice and with an\r\naccent as good as his own.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but not many good ones. However, such as they are, go out and\r\ngather some for _ces dames_."\r\n\r\nThe child turned to him with her smile heightened by pleasure. "May I,\r\ntruly?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, when I tell you," said her father.\r\n\r\nThe girl glanced at the elder of the nuns. "May I, truly, _ma m\xe8re_?"\r\n\r\n"Obey _monsieur_ your father, my child," said the sister, blushing again.\r\n\r\nThe child, satisfied with this authorisation, descended from the\r\nthreshold and was presently lost to sight. "You don\'t spoil them," said\r\nher father gaily.\r\n\r\n"For everything they must ask leave. That\'s our system. Leave is freely\r\ngranted, but they must ask it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t quarrel with your system; I\'ve no doubt it\'s excellent. I\r\nsent you my daughter to see what you\'d make of her. I had faith."\r\n\r\n"One must have faith," the sister blandly rejoined, gazing through her\r\nspectacles.\r\n\r\n"Well, has my faith been rewarded? What have you made of her?"\r\n\r\nThe sister dropped her eyes a moment. "A good Christian, _monsieur_."\r\n\r\nHer host dropped his eyes as well; but it was probable that the movement\r\nhad in each case a different spring. "Yes, and what else?"\r\n\r\nHe watched the lady from the convent, probably thinking she would say\r\nthat a good Christian was everything; but for all her simplicity she\r\nwas not so crude as that. "A charming young lady--a real little woman--a\r\ndaughter in whom you will have nothing but contentment."\r\n\r\n"She seems to me very _gentille_," said the father. "She\'s really pretty."\r\n\r\n"She\'s perfect. She has no faults."\r\n\r\n"She never had any as a child, and I\'m glad you have given her none."\r\n\r\n"We love her too much," said the spectacled sister with dignity.\r\n\r\n"And as for faults, how can we give what we have not? _Le couvent n\'est\r\npas comme le monde, monsieur_. She\'s our daughter, as you may say. We\'ve\r\nhad her since she was so small."\r\n\r\n"Of all those we shall lose this year she\'s the one we shall miss most,"\r\nthe younger woman murmured deferentially.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes, we shall talk long of her," said the other. "We shall hold her\r\nup to the new ones." And at this the good sister appeared to find her\r\nspectacles dim; while her companion, after fumbling a moment, presently\r\ndrew forth a pocket-handkerchief of durable texture.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not certain you\'ll lose her; nothing\'s settled yet," their host\r\nrejoined quickly; not as if to anticipate their tears, but in the tone\r\nof a man saying what was most agreeable to himself. "We should be very\r\nhappy to believe that. Fifteen is very young to leave us."\r\n\r\n"Oh," exclaimed the gentleman with more vivacity than he had yet used,\r\n"it is not I who wish to take her away. I wish you could keep her\r\nalways!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, _monsieur_," said the elder sister, smiling and getting up, "good as\r\nshe is, she\'s made for the world. _Le monde y gagnera_."\r\n\r\n"If all the good people were hidden away in convents how would the world\r\nget on?" her companion softly enquired, rising also.\r\n\r\nThis was a question of a wider bearing than the good woman apparently\r\nsupposed; and the lady in spectacles took a harmonising view by saying\r\ncomfortably: "Fortunately there are good people everywhere."\r\n\r\n"If you\'re going there will be two less here," her host remarked\r\ngallantly.\r\n\r\nFor this extravagant sally his simple visitors had no answer, and they\r\nsimply looked at each other in decent deprecation; but their confusion\r\nwas speedily covered by the return of the young girl with two large\r\nbunches of roses--one of them all white, the other red.\r\n\r\n"I give you your choice, _mamman_ Catherine," said the child. "It\'s only\r\nthe colour that\'s different, _mamman_ Justine; there are just as many\r\nroses in one bunch as in the other."\r\n\r\nThe two sisters turned to each other, smiling and hesitating, with\r\n"Which will you take?" and "No, it\'s for you to choose."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take the red, thank you," said Catherine in the spectacles. "I\'m\r\nso red myself. They\'ll comfort us on our way back to Rome."\r\n\r\n"Ah, they won\'t last," cried the young girl. "I wish I could give you\r\nsomething that would last!"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve given us a good memory of yourself, my daughter. That will\r\nlast!"\r\n\r\n"I wish nuns could wear pretty things. I would give you my blue beads,"\r\nthe child went on.\r\n\r\n"And do you go back to Rome to-night?" her father enquired.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we take the train again. We\'ve so much to do l\xe0-bas."\r\n\r\n"Are you not tired?"\r\n\r\n"We are never tired."\r\n\r\n"Ah, my sister, sometimes," murmured the junior votaress.\r\n\r\n"Not to-day, at any rate. We have rested too well here. _Que Dieu vous\r\ngarde, ma fille._"\r\n\r\nTheir host, while they exchanged kisses with his daughter, went forward\r\nto open the door through which they were to pass; but as he did so he\r\ngave a slight exclamation, and stood looking beyond. The door opened\r\ninto a vaulted ante-chamber, as high as a chapel and paved with red\r\ntiles; and into this antechamber a lady had just been admitted by a\r\nservant, a lad in shabby livery, who was now ushering her toward the\r\napartment in which our friends were grouped. The gentleman at the door,\r\nafter dropping his exclamation, remained silent; in silence too the lady\r\nadvanced. He gave her no further audible greeting and offered her no\r\nhand, but stood aside to let her pass into the saloon. At the threshold\r\nshe hesitated. "Is there any one?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Some one you may see."\r\n\r\nShe went in and found herself confronted with the two nuns and their\r\npupil, who was coming forward, between them, with a hand in the arm of\r\neach. At the sight of the new visitor they all paused, and the lady, who\r\nhad also stopped, stood looking at them. The young girl gave a little\r\nsoft cry: "Ah, Madame Merle!"\r\n\r\nThe visitor had been slightly startled, but her manner the next instant\r\nwas none the less gracious. "Yes, it\'s Madame Merle, come to welcome you\r\nhome." And she held out two hands to the girl, who immediately came up\r\nto her, presenting her forehead to be kissed. Madame Merle saluted this\r\nportion of her charming little person and then stood smiling at the two\r\nnuns. They acknowledged her smile with a decent obeisance, but permitted\r\nthemselves no direct scrutiny of this imposing, brilliant woman, who\r\nseemed to bring in with her something of the radiance of the outer\r\nworld. "These ladies have brought my daughter home, and now they return\r\nto the convent," the gentleman explained.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you go back to Rome? I\'ve lately come from there. It\'s very lovely\r\nnow," said Madame Merle.\r\n\r\nThe good sisters, standing with their hands folded into their sleeves,\r\naccepted this statement uncritically; and the master of the house asked\r\nhis new visitor how long it was since she had left Rome. "She came to\r\nsee me at the convent," said the young girl before the lady addressed\r\nhad time to reply.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been more than once, Pansy," Madame Merle declared. "Am I not your\r\ngreat friend in Rome?"\r\n\r\n"I remember the last time best," said Pansy, "because you told me I\r\nshould come away."\r\n\r\n"Did you tell her that?" the child\'s father asked.\r\n\r\n"I hardly remember. I told her what I thought would please her. I\'ve\r\nbeen in Florence a week. I hoped you would come to see me."\r\n\r\n"I should have done so if I had known you were there. One doesn\'t know\r\nsuch things by inspiration--though I suppose one ought. You had better\r\nsit down."\r\n\r\nThese two speeches were made in a particular tone of voice--a tone\r\nhalf-lowered and carefully quiet, but as from habit rather than from any\r\ndefinite need. Madame Merle looked about her, choosing her seat. "You\'re\r\ngoing to the door with these women? Let me of course not interrupt the\r\nceremony. _Je vous salue, mesdames_," she added, in French, to the nuns,\r\nas if to dismiss them.\r\n\r\n"This lady\'s a great friend of ours; you will have seen her at the\r\nconvent," said their entertainer. "We\'ve much faith in her judgement,\r\nand she\'ll help me to decide whether my daughter shall return to you at\r\nthe end of the holidays."\r\n\r\n"I hope you\'ll decide in our favour, madame," the sister in spectacles\r\nventured to remark.\r\n\r\n"That\'s Mr. Osmond\'s pleasantry; I decide nothing," said Madame Merle,\r\nbut also as in pleasantry. "I believe you\'ve a very good school, but\r\nMiss Osmond\'s friends must remember that she\'s very naturally meant for\r\nthe world."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I\'ve told _monsieur_," sister Catherine answered. "It\'s\r\nprecisely to fit her for the world," she murmured, glancing at Pansy,\r\nwho stood, at a little distance, attentive to Madame Merle\'s elegant\r\napparel.\r\n\r\n"Do you hear that, Pansy? You\'re very naturally meant for the world,"\r\nsaid Pansy\'s father.\r\n\r\nThe child fixed him an instant with her pure young eyes. "Am I not meant\r\nfor you, papa?"\r\n\r\nPapa gave a quick, light laugh. "That doesn\'t prevent it! I\'m of the\r\nworld, Pansy."\r\n\r\n"Kindly permit us to retire," said sister Catherine. "Be good and wise\r\nand happy in any case, my daughter."\r\n\r\n"I shall certainly come back and see you," Pansy returned, recommencing\r\nher embraces, which were presently interrupted by Madame Merle.\r\n\r\n"Stay with me, dear child," she said, "while your father takes the good\r\nladies to the door."\r\n\r\nPansy stared, disappointed, yet not protesting. She was evidently\r\nimpregnated with the idea of submission, which was due to any one who\r\ntook the tone of authority; and she was a passive spectator of the\r\noperation of her fate. "May I not see _mamman_ Catherine get into the\r\ncarriage?" she nevertheless asked very gently.\r\n\r\n"It would please me better if you\'d remain with me," said Madame Merle,\r\nwhile Mr. Osmond and his companions, who had bowed low again to the\r\nother visitor, passed into the ante-chamber.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I\'ll stay," Pansy answered; and she stood near Madame Merle,\r\nsurrendering her little hand, which this lady took. She stared out of\r\nthe window; her eyes had filled with tears.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad they\'ve taught you to obey," said Madame Merle. "That\'s what\r\ngood little girls should do."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I obey very well," cried Pansy with soft eagerness, almost with\r\nboastfulness, as if she had been speaking of her piano-playing. And then\r\nshe gave a faint, just audible sigh.\r\n\r\nMadame Merle, holding her hand, drew it across her own fine palm and\r\nlooked at it. The gaze was critical, but it found nothing to deprecate;\r\nthe child\'s small hand was delicate and fair. "I hope they always see\r\nthat you wear gloves," she said in a moment. "Little girls usually\r\ndislike them."\r\n\r\n"I used to dislike them, but I like them now," the child made answer.\r\n\r\n"Very good, I\'ll make you a present of a dozen."\r\n\r\n"I thank you very much. What colours will they be?" Pansy demanded with\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nMadame Merle meditated. "Useful colours."\r\n\r\n"But very pretty?"\r\n\r\n"Are you very fond of pretty things?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but--but not too fond," said Pansy with a trace of asceticism.\r\n\r\n"Well, they won\'t be too pretty," Madame Merle returned with a laugh.\r\nShe took the child\'s other hand and drew her nearer; after which,\r\nlooking at her a moment, "Shall you miss mother Catherine?" she went on.\r\n\r\n"Yes--when I think of her."\r\n\r\n"Try then not to think of her. Perhaps some day," added Madame Merle,\r\n"you\'ll have another mother."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that\'s necessary," Pansy said, repeating her little soft\r\nconciliatory sigh. "I had more than thirty mothers at the convent."\r\n\r\nHer father\'s step sounded again in the antechamber, and Madame Merle got\r\nup, releasing the child. Mr. Osmond came in and closed the door; then,\r\nwithout looking at Madame Merle, he pushed one or two chairs back into\r\ntheir places. His visitor waited a moment for him to speak, watching him\r\nas he moved about. Then at last she said: "I hoped you\'d have come to\r\nRome. I thought it possible you\'d have wished yourself to fetch Pansy\r\naway."\r\n\r\n"That was a natural supposition; but I\'m afraid it\'s not the first time\r\nI\'ve acted in defiance of your calculations."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Madame Merle, "I think you very perverse."\r\n\r\nMr. Osmond busied himself for a moment in the room--there was plenty of\r\nspace in it to move about--in the fashion of a man mechanically\r\nseeking pretexts for not giving an attention which may be embarrassing.\r\nPresently, however, he had exhausted his pretexts; there was nothing\r\nleft for him--unless he took up a book--but to stand with his hands\r\nbehind him looking at Pansy. "Why didn\'t you come and see the last of\r\n_mamman_ Catherine?" he asked of her abruptly in French.\r\n\r\nPansy hesitated a moment, glancing at Madame Merle. "I asked her to stay\r\nwith me," said this lady, who had seated herself again in another place.\r\n\r\n"Ah, that was better," Osmond conceded. With which he dropped into a\r\nchair and sat looking at Madame Merle; bent forward a little, his elbows\r\non the edge of the arms and his hands interlocked.\r\n\r\n"She\'s going to give me some gloves," said Pansy.\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t tell that to every one, my dear," Madame Merle observed.\r\n\r\n"You\'re very kind to her," said Osmond. "She\'s supposed to have\r\neverything she needs."\r\n\r\n"I should think she had had enough of the nuns."\r\n\r\n"If we\'re going to discuss that matter she had better go out of the\r\nroom."\r\n\r\n"Let her stay," said Madame Merle. "We\'ll talk of something else."\r\n\r\n"If you like I won\'t listen," Pansy suggested with an appearance of\r\ncandour which imposed conviction.\r\n\r\n"You may listen, charming child, because you won\'t understand," her\r\nfather replied. The child sat down, deferentially, near the open door,\r\nwithin sight of the garden, into which she directed her innocent,\r\nwistful eyes; and Mr. Osmond went on irrelevantly, addressing himself to\r\nhis other companion. "You\'re looking particularly well."\r\n\r\n"I think I always look the same," said Madame Merle.\r\n\r\n"You always _are_ the same. You don\'t vary. You\'re a wonderful woman."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think I am."\r\n\r\n"You sometimes change your mind, however. You told me on your return\r\nfrom England that you wouldn\'t leave Rome again for the present."\r\n\r\n"I\'m pleased that you remember so well what I say. That was my\r\nintention. But I\'ve come to Florence to meet some friends who have\r\nlately arrived and as to whose movements I was at that time uncertain."\r\n\r\n"That reason\'s characteristic. You\'re always doing something for your\r\nfriends."\r\n\r\nMadame Merle smiled straight at her host. "It\'s less characteristic than\r\nyour comment upon it which is perfectly insincere. I don\'t, however,\r\nmake a crime of that," she added, "because if you don\'t believe what\r\nyou say there\'s no reason why you should. I don\'t ruin myself for my\r\nfriends; I don\'t deserve your praise. I care greatly for myself."\r\n\r\n"Exactly; but yourself includes so many other selves--so much of every\r\none else and of everything. I never knew a person whose life touched so\r\nmany other lives."\r\n\r\n"What do you call one\'s life?" asked Madame Merle. "One\'s appearance,\r\none\'s movements, one\'s engagements, one\'s society?"\r\n\r\n"I call _your_ life your ambitions," said Osmond.\r\n\r\nMadame Merle looked a moment at Pansy. "I wonder if she understands\r\nthat," she murmured.\r\n\r\n"You see she can\'t stay with us!" And Pansy\'s father gave rather a\r\njoyless smile. "Go into the garden, _mignonne_, and pluck a flower or two\r\nfor Madame Merle," he went on in French.\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I wanted to do," Pansy exclaimed, rising with\r\npromptness and noiselessly departing. Her father followed her to the\r\nopen door, stood a moment watching her, and then came back, but remained\r\nstanding, or rather strolling to and fro, as if to cultivate a sense of\r\nfreedom which in another attitude might be wanting.\r\n\r\n"My ambitions are principally for you," said Madame Merle, looking up at\r\nhim with a certain courage.\r\n\r\n"That comes back to what I say. I\'m part of your life--I and a thousand\r\nothers. You\'re not selfish--I can\'t admit that. If you were selfish,\r\nwhat should I be? What epithet would properly describe me?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re indolent. For me that\'s your worst fault."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid it\'s really my best."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t care," said Madame Merle gravely.\r\n\r\n"No; I don\'t think I care much. What sort of a fault do you call that?\r\nMy indolence, at any rate, was one of the reasons I didn\'t go to Rome.\r\nBut it was only one of them."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not of importance--to me at least--that you didn\'t go; though I\r\nshould have been glad to see you. I\'m glad you\'re not in Rome now--which\r\nyou might be, would probably be, if you had gone there a month ago.\r\nThere\'s something I should like you to do at present in Florence."\r\n\r\n"Please remember my indolence," said Osmond.\r\n\r\n"I do remember it; but I beg you to forget it. In that way you\'ll have\r\nboth the virtue and the reward. This is not a great labour, and it\r\nmay prove a real interest. How long is it since you made a new\r\nacquaintance?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I\'ve made any since I made yours."\r\n\r\n"It\'s time then you should make another. There\'s a friend of mine I want\r\nyou to know."\r\n\r\nMr. Osmond, in his walk, had gone back to the open door again and was\r\nlooking at his daughter as she moved about in the intense sunshine.\r\n"What good will it do me?" he asked with a sort of genial crudity.\r\n\r\nMadame Merle waited. "It will amuse you." There was nothing crude in\r\nthis rejoinder; it had been thoroughly well considered.\r\n\r\n"If you say that, you know, I believe it," said Osmond, coming toward\r\nher. "There are some points in which my confidence in you is complete.\r\nI\'m perfectly aware, for instance, that you know good society from bad."\r\n\r\n"Society is all bad."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me. That isn\'t--the knowledge I impute to you--a common sort\r\nof wisdom. You\'ve gained it in the right way--experimentally; you\'ve\r\ncompared an immense number of more or less impossible people with each\r\nother."\r\n\r\n"Well, I invite you to profit by my knowledge."\r\n\r\n"To profit? Are you very sure that I shall?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s what I hope. It will depend on yourself. If I could only induce\r\nyou to make an effort!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, there you are! I knew something tiresome was coming. What in the\r\nworld--that\'s likely to turn up here--is worth an effort?"\r\n\r\nMadame Merle flushed as with a wounded intention. "Don\'t be foolish,\r\nOsmond. No one knows better than you what _is_ worth an effort. Haven\'t I\r\nseen you in old days?"\r\n\r\n"I recognise some things. But they\'re none of them probable in this poor\r\nlife."\r\n\r\n"It\'s the effort that makes them probable," said Madame Merle.\r\n\r\n"There\'s something in that. Who then is your friend?"\r\n\r\n"The person I came to Florence to see. She\'s a niece of Mrs. Touchett,\r\nwhom you\'ll not have forgotten."\r\n\r\n"A niece? The word niece suggests youth and ignorance. I see what you\'re\r\ncoming to."\r\n\r\n"Yes, she\'s young--twenty-three years old. She\'s a great friend of mine.\r\nI met her for the first time in England, several months ago, and we\r\nstruck up a grand alliance. I like her immensely, and I do what I don\'t\r\ndo every day--I admire her. You\'ll do the same."\r\n\r\n"Not if I can help it."\r\n\r\n"Precisely. But you won\'t be able to help it."\r\n\r\n"Is she beautiful, clever, rich, splendid, universally intelligent and\r\nunprecedentedly virtuous? It\'s only on those conditions that I care to\r\nmake her acquaintance. You know I asked you some time ago never to speak\r\nto me of a creature who shouldn\'t correspond to that description. I know\r\nplenty of dingy people; I don\'t want to know any more."\r\n\r\n"Miss Archer isn\'t dingy; she\'s as bright as the morning. She\r\ncorresponds to your description; it\'s for that I wish you to know her.\r\nShe fills all your requirements."\r\n\r\n"More or less, of course."\r\n\r\n"No; quite literally. She\'s beautiful, accomplished, generous and, for\r\nan American, well-born. She\'s also very clever and very amiable, and she\r\nhas a handsome fortune."\r\n\r\nMr. Osmond listened to this in silence, appearing to turn it over in his\r\nmind with his eyes on his informant. "What do you want to do with her?"\r\nhe asked at last.\r\n\r\n"What you see. Put her in your way."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t she meant for something better than that?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t pretend to know what people are meant for," said Madame Merle.\r\n"I only know what I can do with them."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry for Miss Archer!" Osmond declared.\r\n\r\nMadame Merle got up. "If that\'s a beginning of interest in her I take\r\nnote of it."\r\n\r\nThe two stood there face to face; she settled her mantilla, looking down\r\nat it as she did so. "You\'re looking very well," Osmond repeated still\r\nless relevantly than before. "You have some idea. You\'re never so well\r\nas when you\'ve got an idea; they\'re always becoming to you."\r\n\r\nIn the manner and tone of these two persons, on first meeting at any\r\njuncture, and especially when they met in the presence of others, was\r\nsomething indirect and circumspect, as if they had approached each other\r\nobliquely and addressed each other by implication. The effect of\r\neach appeared to be to intensify to an appreciable degree the\r\nself-consciousness of the other. Madame Merle of course carried off any\r\nembarrassment better than her friend; but even Madame Merle had not\r\non this occasion the form she would have liked to have--the perfect\r\nself-possession she would have wished to wear for her host. The point to\r\nbe made is, however, that at a certain moment the element between them,\r\nwhatever it was, always levelled itself and left them more closely\r\nface to face than either ever was with any one else. This was what had\r\nhappened now. They stood there knowing each other well and each on the\r\nwhole willing to accept the satisfaction of knowing as a compensation\r\nfor the inconvenience--whatever it might be--of being known. "I wish\r\nvery much you were not so heartless," Madame Merle quietly said. "It has\r\nalways been against you, and it will be against you now."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not so heartless as you think. Every now and then something touches\r\nme--as for instance your saying just now that your ambitions are for\r\nme. I don\'t understand it; I don\'t see how or why they should be. But it\r\ntouches me, all the same."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll probably understand it even less as time goes on. There are some\r\nthings you\'ll never understand. There\'s no particular need you should."\r\n\r\n"You, after all, are the most remarkable of women," said Osmond. "You\r\nhave more in you than almost any one. I don\'t see why you think Mrs.\r\nTouchett\'s niece should matter very much to me, when--when--" But he\r\npaused a moment.\r\n\r\n"When I myself have mattered so little?"\r\n\r\n"That of course is not what I meant to say. When I\'ve known and\r\nappreciated such a woman as you."\r\n\r\n"Isabel Archer\'s better than I," said Madame Merle.\r\n\r\nHer companion gave a laugh. "How little you must think of her to say\r\nthat!"\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose I\'m capable of jealousy? Please answer me that."\r\n\r\n"With regard to me? No; on the whole I don\'t."\r\n\r\n"Come and see me then, two days hence. I\'m staying at Mrs.\r\nTouchett\'s--Palazzo Crescentini--and the girl will be there."\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you ask me that at first simply, without speaking of the\r\ngirl?" said Osmond. "You could have had her there at any rate."\r\n\r\nMadame Merle looked at him in the manner of a woman whom no question he\r\ncould ever put would find unprepared. "Do you wish to know why? Because\r\nI\'ve spoken of you to her."\r\n\r\nOsmond frowned and turned away. "I\'d rather not know that." Then in\r\na moment he pointed out the easel supporting the little water-colour\r\ndrawing. "Have you seen what\'s there--my last?"\r\n\r\nMadame Merle drew near and considered. "Is it the Venetian Alps--one of\r\nyour last year\'s sketches?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--but how you guess everything!"\r\n\r\nShe looked a moment longer, then turned away. "You know I don\'t care for\r\nyour drawings."\r\n\r\n"I know it, yet I\'m always surprised at it. They\'re really so much\r\nbetter than most people\'s."\r\n\r\n"That may very well be. But as the only thing you do--well, it\'s so\r\nlittle. I should have liked you to do so many other things: those were\r\nmy ambitions."\r\n\r\n"Yes; you\'ve told me many times--things that were impossible."\r\n\r\n"Things that were impossible," said Madame Merle. And then in quite a\r\ndifferent tone: "In itself your little picture\'s very good." She looked\r\nabout the room--at the old cabinets, pictures, tapestries, surfaces\r\nof faded silk. "Your rooms at least are perfect. I\'m struck with that\r\nafresh whenever I come back; I know none better anywhere. You understand\r\nthis sort of thing as nobody anywhere does. You\'ve such adorable taste."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sick of my adorable taste," said Gilbert Osmond.\r\n\r\n"You must nevertheless let Miss Archer come and see it. I\'ve told her\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t object to showing my things--when people are not idiots."\r\n\r\n"You do it delightfully. As cicerone of your museum you appear to\r\nparticular advantage."\r\n\r\nMr. Osmond, in return for this compliment, simply looked at once colder\r\nand more attentive. "Did you say she was rich?"\r\n\r\n"She has seventy thousand pounds."\r\n\r\n"_En ecus bien comptes_?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s no doubt whatever about her fortune. I\'ve seen it, as I may\r\nsay."\r\n\r\n"Satisfactory woman!--I mean you. And if I go to see her shall I see the\r\nmother?"\r\n\r\n"The mother? She has none--nor father either."\r\n\r\n"The aunt then--whom did you say?--Mrs. Touchett. I can easily keep her\r\nout of the way."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t object to her," said Osmond; "I rather like Mrs. Touchett.\r\nShe has a sort of old-fashioned character that\'s passing away--a vivid\r\nidentity. But that long jackanapes the son--is he about the place?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s there, but he won\'t trouble you."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a good deal of a donkey."\r\n\r\n"I think you\'re mistaken. He\'s a very clever man. But he\'s not fond of\r\nbeing about when I\'m there, because he doesn\'t like me."\r\n\r\n"What could he be more asinine than that? Did you say she has looks?"\r\nOsmond went on.\r\n\r\n"Yes; but I won\'t say it again, lest you should be disappointed in them.\r\nCome and make a beginning; that\'s all I ask of you."\r\n\r\n"A beginning of what?"\r\n\r\nMadame Merle was silent a little. "I want you of course to marry her."\r\n\r\n"The beginning of the end? Well, I\'ll see for myself. Have you told her\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\n"For what do you take me? She\'s not so coarse a piece of machinery--nor\r\nam I."\r\n\r\n"Really," said Osmond after some meditation, "I don\'t understand your\r\nambitions."\r\n\r\n"I think you\'ll understand this one after you\'ve seen Miss Archer.\r\nSuspend your judgement." Madame Merle, as she spoke, had drawn near the\r\nopen door of the garden, where she stood a moment looking out. "Pansy\r\nhas really grown pretty," she presently added.\r\n\r\n"So it seemed to me."\r\n\r\n"But she has had enough of the convent."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Osmond. "I like what they\'ve made of her. It\'s very\r\ncharming."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not the convent. It\'s the child\'s nature."\r\n\r\n"It\'s the combination, I think. She\'s as pure as a pearl."\r\n\r\n"Why doesn\'t she come back with my flowers then?" Madame Merle asked.\r\n"She\'s not in a hurry."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll go and get them."\r\n\r\n"She doesn\'t like me," the visitor murmured as she raised her parasol\r\nand they passed into the garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nMadame Merle, who had come to Florence on Mrs. Touchett\'s arrival at\r\nthe invitation of this lady--Mrs. Touchett offering her for a month the\r\nhospitality of Palazzo Crescentini--the judicious Madame Merle spoke to\r\nIsabel afresh about Gilbert Osmond and expressed the hope she might know\r\nhim; making, however, no such point of the matter as we have seen her do\r\nin recommending the girl herself to Mr. Osmond\'s attention. The reason\r\nof this was perhaps that Isabel offered no resistance whatever to Madame\r\nMerle\'s proposal. In Italy, as in England, the lady had a multitude of\r\nfriends, both among the natives of the country and its heterogeneous\r\nvisitors. She had mentioned to Isabel most of the people the girl would\r\nfind it well to "meet"--of course, she said, Isabel could know whomever\r\nin the wide world she would--and had placed Mr. Osmond near the top of\r\nthe list. He was an old friend of her own; she had known him these dozen\r\nyears; he was one of the cleverest and most agreeable men--well, in\r\nEurope simply. He was altogether above the respectable average; quite\r\nanother affair. He wasn\'t a professional charmer--far from it, and the\r\neffect he produced depended a good deal on the state of his nerves and\r\nhis spirits. When not in the right mood he could fall as low as any one,\r\nsaved only by his looking at such hours rather like a demoralised prince\r\nin exile. But if he cared or was interested or rightly challenged--just\r\nexactly rightly it had to be--then one felt his cleverness and his\r\ndistinction. Those qualities didn\'t depend, in him, as in so many\r\npeople, on his not committing or exposing himself. He had his\r\nperversities--which indeed Isabel would find to be the case with all the\r\nmen really worth knowing--and didn\'t cause his light to shine equally\r\nfor all persons. Madame Merle, however, thought she could undertake that\r\nfor Isabel he would be brilliant. He was easily bored, too easily, and\r\ndull people always put him out; but a quick and cultivated girl like\r\nIsabel would give him a stimulus which was too absent from his life. At\r\nany rate he was a person not to miss. One shouldn\'t attempt to live in\r\nItaly without making a friend of Gilbert Osmond, who knew more about the\r\ncountry than any one except two or three German professors. And if\r\nthey had more knowledge than he it was he who had most perception and\r\ntaste--being artistic through and through. Isabel remembered that her\r\nfriend had spoken of him during their plunge, at Gardencourt, into the\r\ndeeps of talk, and wondered a little what was the nature of the tie\r\nbinding these superior spirits. She felt that Madame Merle\'s ties always\r\nsomehow had histories, and such an impression was part of the interest\r\ncreated by this inordinate woman. As regards her relations with Mr.\r\nOsmond, however, she hinted at nothing but a long-established calm\r\nfriendship. Isabel said she should be happy to know a person who had\r\nenjoyed so high a confidence for so many years. "You ought to see a\r\ngreat many men," Madame Merle remarked; "you ought to see as many as\r\npossible, so as to get used to them."\r\n\r\n"Used to them?" Isabel repeated with that solemn stare which sometimes\r\nseemed to proclaim her deficient in the sense of comedy. "Why, I\'m not\r\nafraid of them--I\'m as used to them as the cook to the butcher-boys."\r\n\r\n"Used to them, I mean, so as to despise them. That\'s what one comes to\r\nwith most of them. You\'ll pick out, for your society, the few whom you\r\ndon\'t despise."\r\n\r\nThis was a note of cynicism that Madame Merle didn\'t often allow herself\r\nto sound; but Isabel was not alarmed, for she had never supposed that\r\nas one saw more of the world the sentiment of respect became the\r\nmost active of one\'s emotions. It was excited, none the less, by the\r\nbeautiful city of Florence, which pleased her not less than Madame Merle\r\nhad promised; and if her unassisted perception had not been able to\r\ngauge its charms she had clever companions as priests to the mystery.\r\nShe was--in no want indeed of esthetic illumination, for Ralph found it\r\na joy that renewed his own early passion to act as cicerone to his\r\neager young kinswoman. Madame Merle remained at home; she had seen the\r\ntreasures of Florence again and again and had always something else\r\nto do. But she talked of all things with remarkable vividness of\r\nmemory--she recalled the right-hand corner of the large Perugino and the\r\nposition of the hands of the Saint Elizabeth in the picture next to it.\r\nShe had her opinions as to the character of many famous works of art,\r\ndiffering often from Ralph with great sharpness and defending her\r\ninterpretations with as much ingenuity as good-humour. Isabel listened\r\nto the discussions taking place between the two with a sense that\r\nshe might derive much benefit from them and that they were among the\r\nadvantages she couldn\'t have enjoyed for instance in Albany. In the\r\nclear May mornings before the formal breakfast--this repast at Mrs.\r\nTouchett\'s was served at twelve o\'clock--she wandered with her cousin\r\nthrough the narrow and sombre Florentine streets, resting a while in\r\nthe thicker dusk of some historic church or the vaulted chambers of some\r\ndispeopled convent. She went to the galleries and palaces; she looked at\r\nthe pictures and statues that had hitherto been great names to her,\r\nand exchanged for a knowledge which was sometimes a limitation a\r\npresentiment which proved usually to have been a blank. She performed\r\nall those acts of mental prostration in which, on a first visit to\r\nItaly, youth and enthusiasm so freely indulge; she felt her heart beat\r\nin the presence of immortal genius and knew the sweetness of rising\r\ntears in eyes to which faded fresco and darkened marble grew dim. But\r\nthe return, every day, was even pleasanter than the going forth; the\r\nreturn into the wide, monumental court of the great house in which Mrs.\r\nTouchett, many years before, had established herself, and into the\r\nhigh, cool rooms where the carven rafters and pompous frescoes of the\r\nsixteenth century looked down on the familiar commodities of the age of\r\nadvertisement. Mrs. Touchett inhabited an historic building in a narrow\r\nstreet whose very name recalled the strife of medieval factions; and\r\nfound compensation for the darkness of her frontage in the modicity of\r\nher rent and the brightness of a garden where nature itself looked as\r\narchaic as the rugged architecture of the palace and which cleared\r\nand scented the rooms in regular use. To live in such a place was, for\r\nIsabel, to hold to her ear all day a shell of the sea of the past. This\r\nvague eternal rumour kept her imagination awake.\r\n\r\nGilbert Osmond came to see Madame Merle, who presented him to the young\r\nlady lurking at the other side of the room. Isabel took on this occasion\r\nlittle part in the talk; she scarcely even smiled when the others turned\r\nto her invitingly; she sat there as if she had been at the play and had\r\npaid even a large sum for her place. Mrs. Touchett was not present, and\r\nthese two had it, for the effect of brilliancy, all their own way. They\r\ntalked of the Florentine, the Roman, the cosmopolite world, and might\r\nhave been distinguished performers figuring for a charity. It all had\r\nthe rich readiness that would have come from rehearsal. Madame Merle\r\nappealed to her as if she had been on the stage, but she could ignore\r\nany learnt cue without spoiling the scene--though of course she thus put\r\ndreadfully in the wrong the friend who had told Mr. Osmond she could be\r\ndepended on. This was no matter for once; even if more had been involved\r\nshe could have made no attempt to shine. There was something in\r\nthe visitor that checked her and held her in suspense--made it more\r\nimportant she should get an impression of him than that she should\r\nproduce one herself. Besides, she had little skill in producing an\r\nimpression which she knew to be expected: nothing could be happier, in\r\ngeneral, than to seem dazzling, but she had a perverse unwillingness to\r\nglitter by arrangement. Mr. Osmond, to do him justice, had a well-bred\r\nair of expecting nothing, a quiet ease that covered everything, even the\r\nfirst show of his own wit. This was the more grateful as his face, his\r\nhead, was sensitive; he was not handsome, but he was fine, as fine as\r\none of the drawings in the long gallery above the bridge of the\r\nUffizi. And his very voice was fine--the more strangely that, with its\r\nclearness, it yet somehow wasn\'t sweet. This had had really to do with\r\nmaking her abstain from interference. His utterance was the vibration\r\nof glass, and if she had put out her finger she might have changed the\r\npitch and spoiled the concert. Yet before he went she had to speak.\r\n\r\n"Madame Merle," he said, "consents to come up to my hill-top some day\r\nnext week and drink tea in my garden. It would give me much pleasure if\r\nyou would come with her. It\'s thought rather pretty--there\'s what they\r\ncall a general view. My daughter too would be so glad--or rather, for\r\nshe\'s too young to have strong emotions, I should be so glad--so very\r\nglad." And Mr. Osmond paused with a slight air of embarrassment, leaving\r\nhis sentence unfinished. "I should be so happy if you could know my\r\ndaughter," he went on a moment afterwards.\r\n\r\nIsabel replied that she should be delighted to see Miss Osmond and that\r\nif Madame Merle would show her the way to the hill-top she should be\r\nvery grateful. Upon this assurance the visitor took his leave; after\r\nwhich Isabel fully expected her friend would scold her for having been\r\nso stupid. But to her surprise that lady, who indeed never fell into the\r\nmere matter-of-course, said to her in a few moments,\r\n\r\n"You were charming, my dear; you were just as one would have wished you.\r\nYou\'re never disappointing."\r\n\r\nA rebuke might possibly have been irritating, though it is much more\r\nprobable that Isabel would have taken it in good part; but, strange\r\nto say, the words that Madame Merle actually used caused her the first\r\nfeeling of displeasure she had known this ally to excite. "That\'s more\r\nthan I intended," she answered coldly. "I\'m under no obligation that I\r\nknow of to charm Mr. Osmond."\r\n\r\nMadame Merle perceptibly flushed, but we know it was not her habit to\r\nretract. "My dear child, I didn\'t speak for him, poor man; I spoke for\r\nyourself. It\'s not of course a question as to his liking you; it matters\r\nlittle whether he likes you or not! But I thought you liked _him_."\r\n\r\n"I did," said Isabel honestly. "But I don\'t see what that matters\r\neither."\r\n\r\n"Everything that concerns you matters to me," Madame Merle returned\r\nwith her weary nobleness; "especially when at the same time another old\r\nfriend\'s concerned."\r\n\r\nWhatever Isabel\'s obligations may have been to Mr. Osmond, it must be\r\nadmitted that she found them sufficient to lead her to put to Ralph\r\nsundry questions about him. She thought Ralph\'s judgements distorted by\r\nhis trials, but she flattered herself she had learned to make allowance\r\nfor that.\r\n\r\n"Do I know him?" said her cousin. "Oh, yes, I \'know\' him; not well,\r\nbut on the whole enough. I\'ve never cultivated his society, and he\r\napparently has never found mine indispensable to his happiness. Who is\r\nhe, what is he? He\'s a vague, unexplained American who has been living\r\nthese thirty years, or less, in Italy. Why do I call him unexplained?\r\nOnly as a cover for my ignorance; I don\'t know his antecedents, his\r\nfamily, his origin. For all I do know he may be a prince in disguise; he\r\nrather looks like one, by the way--like a prince who has abdicated in a\r\nfit of fastidiousness and has been in a state of disgust ever since. He\r\nused to live in Rome; but of late years he has taken up his abode here;\r\nI remember hearing him say that Rome has grown vulgar. He has a great\r\ndread of vulgarity; that\'s his special line; he hasn\'t any other that I\r\nknow of. He lives on his income, which I suspect of not being vulgarly\r\nlarge. He\'s a poor but honest gentleman that\'s what he calls himself.\r\nHe married young and lost his wife, and I believe he has a daughter. He\r\nalso has a sister, who\'s married to some small Count or other, of these\r\nparts; I remember meeting her of old. She\'s nicer than he, I should\r\nthink, but rather impossible. I remember there used to be some stories\r\nabout her. I don\'t think I recommend you to know her. But why don\'t you\r\nask Madame Merle about these people? She knows them all much better than\r\nI."\r\n\r\n"I ask you because I want your opinion as well as hers," said Isabel.\r\n\r\n"A fig for my opinion! If you fall in love with Mr. Osmond what will you\r\ncare for that?"\r\n\r\n"Not much, probably. But meanwhile it has a certain importance. The more\r\ninformation one has about one\'s dangers the better."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t agree to that--it may make them dangers. We know too much about\r\npeople in these days; we hear too much. Our ears, our minds, our mouths,\r\nare stuffed with personalities. Don\'t mind anything any one tells you\r\nabout any one else. Judge everyone and everything for yourself."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I try to do," said Isabel "but when you do that people call\r\nyou conceited."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not to mind them--that\'s precisely my argument; not to mind what\r\nthey say about yourself any more than what they say about your friend or\r\nyour enemy."\r\n\r\nIsabel considered. "I think you\'re right; but there are some things I\r\ncan\'t help minding: for instance when my friend\'s attacked or when I\r\nmyself am praised."\r\n\r\n"Of course you\'re always at liberty to judge the critic. Judge people as\r\ncritics, however," Ralph added, "and you\'ll condemn them all!"\r\n\r\n"I shall see Mr. Osmond for myself," said Isabel. "I\'ve promised to pay\r\nhim a visit."\r\n\r\n"To pay him a visit?"\r\n\r\n"To go and see his view, his pictures, his daughter--I don\'t know\r\nexactly what. Madame Merle\'s to take me; she tells me a great many\r\nladies call on him."\r\n\r\n"Ah, with Madame Merle you may go anywhere, _de confiance_," said Ralph.\r\n"She knows none but the best people."\r\n\r\nIsabel said no more about Mr. Osmond, but she presently remarked to her\r\ncousin that she was not satisfied with his tone about Madame Merle. "It\r\nseems to me you insinuate things about her. I don\'t know what you mean,\r\nbut if you\'ve any grounds for disliking her I think you should either\r\nmention them frankly or else say nothing at all."\r\n\r\nRalph, however, resented this charge with more apparent earnestness than\r\nhe commonly used. "I speak of Madame Merle exactly as I speak to her:\r\nwith an even exaggerated respect."\r\n\r\n"Exaggerated, precisely. That\'s what I complain of."\r\n\r\n"I do so because Madame Merle\'s merits are exaggerated."\r\n\r\n"By whom, pray? By me? If so I do her a poor service."\r\n\r\n"No, no; by herself."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I protest!" Isabel earnestly cried. "If ever there was a woman who\r\nmade small claims--!"\r\n\r\n"You put your finger on it," Ralph interrupted. "Her modesty\'s\r\nexaggerated. She has no business with small claims--she has a perfect\r\nright to make large ones."\r\n\r\n"Her merits are large then. You contradict yourself."\r\n\r\n"Her merits are immense," said Ralph. "She\'s indescribably blameless; a\r\npathless desert of virtue; the only woman I know who never gives one a\r\nchance."\r\n\r\n"A chance for what?"\r\n\r\n"Well, say to call her a fool! She\'s the only woman I know who has but\r\nthat one little fault."\r\n\r\nIsabel turned away with impatience. "I don\'t understand you; you\'re too\r\nparadoxical for my plain mind."\r\n\r\n"Let me explain. When I say she exaggerates I don\'t mean it in the\r\nvulgar sense--that she boasts, overstates, gives too fine an account of\r\nherself. I mean literally that she pushes the search for perfection too\r\nfar--that her merits are in themselves overstrained. She\'s too good, too\r\nkind, too clever, too learned, too accomplished, too everything. She\'s\r\ntoo complete, in a word. I confess to you that she acts on my nerves and\r\nthat I feel about her a good deal as that intensely human Athenian felt\r\nabout Aristides the Just."\r\n\r\nIsabel looked hard at her cousin; but the mocking spirit, if it lurked\r\nin his words, failed on this occasion to peep from his face. "Do you\r\nwish Madame Merle to be banished?"\r\n\r\n"By no means. She\'s much too good company. I delight in Madame Merle,"\r\nsaid Ralph Touchett simply.\r\n\r\n"You\'re very odious, sir!" Isabel exclaimed. And then she asked him if\r\nhe knew anything that was not to the honour of her brilliant friend.\r\n\r\n"Nothing whatever. Don\'t you see that\'s just what I mean? On the\r\ncharacter of every one else you may find some little black speck; if\r\nI were to take half an hour to it, some day, I\'ve no doubt I should be\r\nable to find one on yours. For my own, of course, I\'m spotted like a\r\nleopard. But on Madame Merle\'s nothing, nothing, nothing!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I think!" said Isabel with a toss of her head. "That\r\nis why I like her so much."\r\n\r\n"She\'s a capital person for you to know. Since you wish to see the world\r\nyou couldn\'t have a better guide."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you mean by that that she\'s worldly?"\r\n\r\n"Worldly? No," said Ralph, "she\'s the great round world itself!"\r\n\r\nIt had certainly not, as Isabel for the moment took it into her head to\r\nbelieve, been a refinement of malice in him to say that he delighted in\r\nMadame Merle. Ralph Touchett took his refreshment wherever he could find\r\nit, and he would not have forgiven himself if he had been left wholly\r\nunbeguiled by such a mistress of the social art. There are deep-lying\r\nsympathies and antipathies, and it may have been that, in spite of the\r\nadministered justice she enjoyed at his hands, her absence from his\r\nmother\'s house would not have made life barren to him. But Ralph\r\nTouchett had learned more or less inscrutably to attend, and there could\r\nhave been nothing so "sustained" to attend to as the general performance\r\nof Madame Merle. He tasted her in sips, he let her stand, with an\r\nopportuneness she herself could not have surpassed. There were moments\r\nwhen he felt almost sorry for her; and these, oddly enough, were the\r\nmoments when his kindness was least demonstrative. He was sure she had\r\nbeen yearningly ambitious and that what she had visibly accomplished was\r\nfar below her secret measure. She had got herself into perfect training,\r\nbut had won none of the prizes. She was always plain Madame Merle,\r\nthe widow of a Swiss negociant, with a small income and a large\r\nacquaintance, who stayed with people a great deal and was almost as\r\nuniversally "liked" as some new volume of smooth twaddle. The contrast\r\nbetween this position and any one of some half-dozen others that he\r\nsupposed to have at various moments engaged her hope had an element of\r\nthe tragical. His mother thought he got on beautifully with their genial\r\nguest; to Mrs. Touchett\'s sense two persons who dealt so largely in\r\ntoo-ingenious theories of conduct--that is of their own--would have much\r\nin common. He had given due consideration to Isabel\'s intimacy with her\r\neminent friend, having long since made up his mind that he could not,\r\nwithout opposition, keep his cousin to himself; and he made the best of\r\nit, as he had done of worse things. He believed it would take care of\r\nitself; it wouldn\'t last forever. Neither of these two superior persons\r\nknew the other as well as she supposed, and when each had made an\r\nimportant discovery or two there would be, if not a rupture, at least\r\na relaxation. Meanwhile he was quite willing to admit that the\r\nconversation of the elder lady was an advantage to the younger, who had\r\na great deal to learn and would doubtless learn it better from Madame\r\nMerle than from some other instructors of the young. It was not probable\r\nthat Isabel would be injured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nIt would certainly have been hard to see what injury could arise to\r\nher from the visit she presently paid to Mr. Osmond\'s hill-top. Nothing\r\ncould have been more charming than this occasion--a soft afternoon in\r\nthe full maturity of the Tuscan spring. The companions drove out of the\r\nRoman Gate, beneath the enormous blank superstructure which crowns the\r\nfine clear arch of that portal and makes it nakedly impressive, and\r\nwound between high-walled lanes into which the wealth of blossoming\r\norchards over-drooped and flung a fragrance, until they reached the\r\nsmall superurban piazza, of crooked shape, where the long brown wall of\r\nthe villa occupied in part by Mr. Osmond formed a principal, or at least\r\na very imposing, object. Isabel went with her friend through a wide,\r\nhigh court, where a clear shadow rested below and a pair of light-arched\r\ngalleries, facing each other above, caught the upper sunshine upon their\r\nslim columns and the flowering plants in which they were dressed. There\r\nwas something grave and strong in the place; it looked somehow as\r\nif, once you were in, you would need an act of energy to get out. For\r\nIsabel, however, there was of course as yet no thought of getting out,\r\nbut only of advancing. Mr. Osmond met her in the cold ante-chamber--it\r\nwas cold even in the month of May--and ushered her, with her\r\nconductress, into the apartment to which we have already been\r\nintroduced. Madame Merle was in front, and while Isabel lingered a\r\nlittle, talking with him, she went forward familiarly and greeted two\r\npersons who were seated in the saloon. One of these was little Pansy, on\r\nwhom she bestowed a kiss; the other was a lady whom Mr. Osmond indicated\r\nto Isabel as his sister, the Countess Gemini. "And that\'s my little\r\ngirl," he said, "who has just come out of her convent."\r\n\r\nPansy had on a scant white dress, and her fair hair was neatly arranged\r\nin a net; she wore her small shoes tied sandal-fashion about her ankles.\r\nShe made Isabel a little conventual curtsey and then came to be kissed.\r\nThe Countess Gemini simply nodded without getting up: Isabel could see\r\nshe was a woman of high fashion. She was thin and dark and not at\r\nall pretty, having features that suggested some tropical bird--a long\r\nbeak-like nose, small, quickly-moving eyes and a mouth and chin\r\nthat receded extremely. Her expression, however, thanks to various\r\nintensities of emphasis and wonder, of horror and joy, was not inhuman,\r\nand, as regards her appearance, it was plain she understood herself\r\nand made the most of her points. Her attire, voluminous and delicate,\r\nbristling with elegance, had the look of shimmering plumage, and her\r\nattitudes were as light and sudden as those of a creature who perched\r\nupon twigs. She had a great deal of manner; Isabel, who had never\r\nknown any one with so much manner, immediately classed her as the most\r\naffected of women. She remembered that Ralph had not recommended her as\r\nan acquaintance; but she was ready to acknowledge that to a casual view\r\nthe Countess Gemini revealed no depths. Her demonstrations suggested the\r\nviolent waving of some flag of general truce--white silk with fluttering\r\nstreamers.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll believe I\'m glad to see you when I tell you it\'s only because\r\nI knew you were to be here that I came myself. I don\'t come and see my\r\nbrother--I make him come and see me. This hill of his is impossible--I\r\ndon\'t see what possesses him. Really, Osmond, you\'ll be the ruin of my\r\nhorses some day, and if it hurts them you\'ll have to give me another\r\npair. I heard them wheezing to-day; I assure you I did. It\'s very\r\ndisagreeable to hear one\'s horses wheezing when one\'s sitting in the\r\ncarriage; it sounds too as if they weren\'t what they should be. But\r\nI\'ve always had good horses; whatever else I may have lacked I\'ve always\r\nmanaged that. My husband doesn\'t know much, but I think he knows a\r\nhorse. In general Italians don\'t, but my husband goes in, according to\r\nhis poor light, for everything English. My horses are English--so it\'s\r\nall the greater pity they should be ruined. I must tell you," she went\r\non, directly addressing Isabel, "that Osmond doesn\'t often invite me;\r\nI don\'t think he likes to have me. It was quite my own idea, coming\r\nto-day. I like to see new people, and I\'m sure you\'re very new. But\r\ndon\'t sit there; that chair\'s not what it looks. There are some very\r\ngood seats here, but there are also some horrors."\r\n\r\nThese remarks were delivered with a series of little jerks and pecks, of\r\nroulades of shrillness, and in an accent that was as some fond recall of\r\ngood English, or rather of good American, in adversity.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like to have you, my dear?" said her brother. "I\'m sure you\'re\r\ninvaluable."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see any horrors anywhere," Isabel returned, looking about her.\r\n"Everything seems to me beautiful and precious."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve a few good things," Mr. Osmond allowed; "indeed I\'ve nothing very\r\nbad. But I\'ve not what I should have liked."\r\n\r\nHe stood there a little awkwardly, smiling and glancing about; his\r\nmanner was an odd mixture of the detached and the involved. He seemed to\r\nhint that nothing but the right "values" was of any consequence. Isabel\r\nmade a rapid induction: perfect simplicity was not the badge of his\r\nfamily. Even the little girl from the convent, who, in her prim white\r\ndress, with her small submissive face and her hands locked before her,\r\nstood there as if she were about to partake of her first communion,\r\neven Mr. Osmond\'s diminutive daughter had a kind of finish that was not\r\nentirely artless.\r\n\r\n"You\'d have liked a few things from the Uffizi and the Pitti--that\'s what\r\nyou\'d have liked," said Madame Merle.\r\n\r\n"Poor Osmond, with his old curtains and crucifixes!" the Countess Gemini\r\nexclaimed: she appeared to call her brother only by his family-name. Her\r\nejaculation had no particular object; she smiled at Isabel as she made\r\nit and looked at her from head to foot.\r\n\r\nHer brother had not heard her; he seemed to be thinking what he could\r\nsay to Isabel. "Won\'t you have some tea?--you must be very tired," he at\r\nlast bethought himself of remarking.\r\n\r\n"No indeed, I\'m not tired; what have I done to tire me?" Isabel felt a\r\ncertain need of being very direct, of pretending to nothing; there was\r\nsomething in the air, in her general impression of things--she could\r\nhardly have said what it was--that deprived her of all disposition to\r\nput herself forward. The place, the occasion, the combination of people,\r\nsignified more than lay on the surface; she would try to understand--she\r\nwould not simply utter graceful platitudes. Poor Isabel was doubtless\r\nnot aware that many women would have uttered graceful platitudes to\r\ncover the working of their observation. It must be confessed that her\r\npride was a trifle alarmed. A man she had heard spoken of in terms\r\nthat excited interest and who was evidently capable of distinguishing\r\nhimself, had invited her, a young lady not lavish of her favours,\r\nto come to his house. Now that she had done so the burden of the\r\nentertainment rested naturally on his wit. Isabel was not rendered\r\nless observant, and for the moment, we judge, she was not rendered\r\nmore indulgent, by perceiving that Mr. Osmond carried his burden less\r\ncomplacently than might have been expected. "What a fool I was to\r\nhave let myself so needlessly in--!" she could fancy his exclaiming to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be tired when you go home, if he shows you all his bibelots and\r\ngives you a lecture on each," said the Countess Gemini.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not afraid of that; but if I\'m tired I shall at least have learned\r\nsomething."\r\n\r\n"Very little, I suspect. But my sister\'s dreadfully afraid of learning\r\nanything," said Mr. Osmond.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I confess to that; I don\'t want to know anything more--I know too\r\nmuch already. The more you know the more unhappy you are."\r\n\r\n"You should not undervalue knowledge before Pansy, who has not finished\r\nher education," Madame Merle interposed with a smile. "Pansy will\r\nnever know any harm," said the child\'s father. "Pansy\'s a little\r\nconvent-flower."\r\n\r\n"Oh, the convents, the convents!" cried the Countess with a flutter of\r\nher ruffles. "Speak to me of the convents! You may learn anything there;\r\nI\'m a convent-flower myself. I don\'t pretend to be good, but the nuns\r\ndo. Don\'t you see what I mean?" she went on, appealing to Isabel.\r\n\r\nIsabel was not sure she saw, and she answered that she was very bad\r\nat following arguments. The Countess then declared that she herself\r\ndetested arguments, but that this was her brother\'s taste--he would\r\nalways discuss. "For me," she said, "one should like a thing or one\r\nshouldn\'t; one can\'t like everything, of course. But one shouldn\'t\r\nattempt to reason it out--you never know where it may lead you. There\r\nare some very good feelings that may have bad reasons, don\'t you know?\r\nAnd then there are very bad feelings, sometimes, that have good reasons.\r\nDon\'t you see what I mean? I don\'t care anything about reasons, but I\r\nknow what I like."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s the great thing," said Isabel, smiling and suspecting that\r\nher acquaintance with this lightly flitting personage would not lead to\r\nintellectual repose. If the Countess objected to argument Isabel at this\r\nmoment had as little taste for it, and she put out her hand to Pansy\r\nwith a pleasant sense that such a gesture committed her to nothing that\r\nwould admit of a divergence of views. Gilbert Osmond apparently took a\r\nrather hopeless view of his sister\'s tone; he turned the conversation to\r\nanother topic. He presently sat down on the other side of his daughter,\r\nwho had shyly brushed Isabel\'s fingers with her own; but he ended by\r\ndrawing her out of her chair and making her stand between his knees,\r\nleaning against him while he passed his arm round her slimness. The\r\nchild fixed her eyes on Isabel with a still, disinterested gaze which\r\nseemed void of an intention, yet conscious of an attraction. Mr. Osmond\r\ntalked of many things; Madame Merle had said he could be agreeable\r\nwhen he chose, and to-day, after a little, he appeared not only to have\r\nchosen but to have determined. Madame Merle and the Countess Gemini sat\r\na little apart, conversing in the effortless manner of persons who knew\r\neach other well enough to take their ease; but every now and then Isabel\r\nheard the Countess, at something said by her companion, plunge into the\r\nlatter\'s lucidity as a poodle splashes after a thrown stick. It was as\r\nif Madame Merle were seeing how far she would go. Mr. Osmond talked of\r\nFlorence, of Italy, of the pleasure of living in that country and of the\r\nabatements to the pleasure. There were both satisfactions and drawbacks;\r\nthe drawbacks were numerous; strangers were too apt to see such a world\r\nas all romantic. It met the case soothingly for the human, for the\r\nsocial failure--by which he meant the people who couldn\'t "realise," as\r\nthey said, on their sensibility: they could keep it about them there,\r\nin their poverty, without ridicule, as you might keep an heirloom or an\r\ninconvenient entailed place that brought you in nothing. Thus there were\r\nadvantages in living in the country which contained the greatest sum of\r\nbeauty. Certain impressions you could get only there. Others, favourable\r\nto life, you never got, and you got some that were very bad. But from\r\ntime to time you got one of a quality that made up for everything.\r\nItaly, all the same, had spoiled a great many people; he was even\r\nfatuous enough to believe at times that he himself might have been a\r\nbetter man if he had spent less of his life there. It made one idle and\r\ndilettantish and second-rate; it had no discipline for the character,\r\ndidn\'t cultivate in you, otherwise expressed, the successful social\r\nand other "cheek" that flourished in Paris and London. "We\'re sweetly\r\nprovincial," said Mr. Osmond, "and I\'m perfectly aware that I myself am\r\nas rusty as a key that has no lock to fit it. It polishes me up a little\r\nto talk with you--not that I venture to pretend I can turn that very\r\ncomplicated lock I suspect your intellect of being! But you\'ll be going\r\naway before I\'ve seen you three times, and I shall perhaps never see you\r\nafter that. That\'s what it is to live in a country that people come to.\r\nWhen they\'re disagreeable here it\'s bad enough; when they\'re agreeable\r\nit\'s still worse. As soon as you like them they\'re off again! I\'ve been\r\ndeceived too often; I\'ve ceased to form attachments, to permit myself\r\nto feel attractions. You mean to stay--to settle? That would be really\r\ncomfortable. Ah yes, your aunt\'s a sort of guarantee; I believe she may\r\nbe depended on. Oh, she\'s an old Florentine; I mean literally an old\r\none; not a modern outsider. She\'s a contemporary of the Medici; she must\r\nhave been present at the burning of Savonarola, and I\'m not sure she\r\ndidn\'t throw a handful of chips into the flame. Her face is very much\r\nlike some faces in the early pictures; little, dry, definite faces that\r\nmust have had a good deal of expression, but almost always the same one.\r\nIndeed I can show you her portrait in a fresco of Ghirlandaio\'s. I hope\r\nyou don\'t object to my speaking that way of your aunt, eh? I\'ve an idea\r\nyou don\'t. Perhaps you think that\'s even worse. I assure you there\'s\r\nno want of respect in it, to either of you. You know I\'m a particular\r\nadmirer of Mrs. Touchett."\r\n\r\nWhile Isabel\'s host exerted himself to entertain her in this somewhat\r\nconfidential fashion she looked occasionally at Madame Merle, who met\r\nher eyes with an inattentive smile in which, on this occasion, there\r\nwas no infelicitous intimation that our heroine appeared to advantage.\r\nMadame Merle eventually proposed to the Countess Gemini that they\r\nshould go into the garden, and the Countess, rising and shaking out\r\nher feathers, began to rustle toward the door. "Poor Miss Archer!" she\r\nexclaimed, surveying the other group with expressive compassion. "She\r\nhas been brought quite into the family."\r\n\r\n"Miss Archer can certainly have nothing but sympathy for a family to\r\nwhich you belong," Mr. Osmond answered, with a laugh which, though it\r\nhad something of a mocking ring, had also a finer patience.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you mean by that! I\'m sure she\'ll see no harm in\r\nme but what you tell her. I\'m better than he says, Miss Archer," the\r\nCountess went on. "I\'m only rather an idiot and a bore. Is that all he\r\nhas said? Ah then, you keep him in good-humour. Has he opened on one of\r\nhis favourite subjects? I give you notice that there are two or three\r\nthat he treats _\xe0 fond_. In that case you had better take off your\r\nbonnet."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I know what Mr. Osmond\'s favourite subjects are," said\r\nIsabel, who had risen to her feet.\r\n\r\nThe Countess assumed for an instant an attitude of intense meditation,\r\npressing one of her hands, with the finger-tips gathered together, to\r\nher forehead. "I\'ll tell you in a moment. One\'s Machiavelli; the other\'s\r\nVittoria Colonna; the next is Metastasio."\r\n\r\n"Ah, with me," said Madame Merle, passing her arm into the Countess\r\nGemini\'s as if to guide her course to the garden, "Mr. Osmond\'s never so\r\nhistorical."\r\n\r\n"Oh you," the Countess answered as they moved away, "you yourself are\r\nMachiavelli--you yourself are Vittoria Colonna!"\r\n\r\n"We shall hear next that poor Madame Merle is Metastasio!" Gilbert\r\nOsmond resignedly sighed.\r\n\r\nIsabel had got up on the assumption that they too were to go into the\r\ngarden; but her host stood there with no apparent inclination to leave\r\nthe room, his hands in the pockets of his jacket and his daughter, who\r\nhad now locked her arm into one of his own, clinging to him and looking\r\nup while her eyes moved from his own face to Isabel\'s. Isabel waited,\r\nwith a certain unuttered contentedness, to have her movements directed;\r\nshe liked Mr. Osmond\'s talk, his company: she had what always gave her\r\na very private thrill, the consciousness of a new relation. Through\r\nthe open doors of the great room she saw Madame Merle and the Countess\r\nstroll across the fine grass of the garden; then she turned, and her\r\neyes wandered over the things scattered about her. The understanding\r\nhad been that Mr. Osmond should show her his treasures; his pictures and\r\ncabinets all looked like treasures. Isabel after a moment went toward\r\none of the pictures to see it better; but just as she had done so he\r\nsaid to her abruptly: "Miss Archer, what do you think of my sister?"\r\n\r\nShe faced him with some surprise. "Ah, don\'t ask me that--I\'ve seen your\r\nsister too little."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you\'ve seen her very little; but you must have observed that\r\nthere is not a great deal of her to see. What do you think of our family\r\ntone?" he went on with his cool smile. "I should like to know how\r\nit strikes a fresh, unprejudiced mind. I know what you\'re going to\r\nsay--you\'ve had almost no observation of it. Of course this is only\r\na glimpse. But just take notice, in future, if you have a chance. I\r\nsometimes think we\'ve got into a rather bad way, living off here among\r\nthings and people not our own, without responsibilities or attachments,\r\nwith nothing to hold us together or keep us up; marrying foreigners,\r\nforming artificial tastes, playing tricks with our natural mission. Let\r\nme add, though, that I say that much more for myself than for my sister.\r\nShe\'s a very honest lady--more so than she seems. She\'s rather\r\nunhappy, and as she\'s not of a serious turn she doesn\'t tend to show\r\nit tragically: she shows it comically instead. She has got a horrid\r\nhusband, though I\'m not sure she makes the best of him. Of course,\r\nhowever, a horrid husband\'s an awkward thing. Madame Merle gives her\r\nexcellent advice, but it\'s a good deal like giving a child a dictionary\r\nto learn a language with. He can look out the words, but he can\'t put\r\nthem together. My sister needs a grammar, but unfortunately she\'s not\r\ngrammatical. Pardon my troubling you with these details; my sister was\r\nvery right in saying you\'ve been taken into the family. Let me take down\r\nthat picture; you want more light."\r\n\r\nHe took down the picture, carried it toward the window, related some\r\ncurious facts about it. She looked at the other works of art, and he\r\ngave her such further information as might appear most acceptable to\r\na young lady making a call on a summer afternoon. His pictures, his\r\nmedallions and tapestries were interesting; but after a while Isabel\r\nfelt the owner much more so, and independently of them, thickly as they\r\nseemed to overhang him. He resembled no one she had ever seen; most\r\nof the people she knew might be divided into groups of half a dozen\r\nspecimens. There were one or two exceptions to this; she could think for\r\ninstance of no group that would contain her aunt Lydia. There were other\r\npeople who were, relatively speaking, original--original, as one might\r\nsay, by courtesy such as Mr. Goodwood, as her cousin Ralph, as Henrietta\r\nStackpole, as Lord Warburton, as Madame Merle. But in essentials, when\r\none came to look at them, these individuals belonged to types already\r\npresent to her mind. Her mind contained no class offering a natural\r\nplace to Mr. Osmond--he was a specimen apart. It was not that she\r\nrecognised all these truths at the hour, but they were falling into\r\norder before her. For the moment she only said to herself that this "new\r\nrelation" would perhaps prove her very most distinguished. Madame Merle\r\nhad had that note of rarity, but what quite other power it immediately\r\ngained when sounded by a man! It was not so much what he said and did,\r\nbut rather what he withheld, that marked him for her as by one of those\r\nsigns of the highly curious that he was showing her on the underside of\r\nold plates and in the corner of sixteenth-century drawings: he indulged\r\nin no striking deflections from common usage, he was an original without\r\nbeing an eccentric. She had never met a person of so fine a grain.\r\nThe peculiarity was physical, to begin with, and it extended to\r\nimpalpabilities. His dense, delicate hair, his overdrawn, retouched\r\nfeatures, his clear complexion, ripe without being coarse, the very\r\nevenness of the growth of his beard, and that light, smooth slenderness\r\nof structure which made the movement of a single one of his fingers\r\nproduce the effect of an expressive gesture--these personal points\r\nstruck our sensitive young woman as signs of quality, of intensity,\r\nsomehow as promises of interest. He was certainly fastidious and\r\ncritical; he was probably irritable. His sensibility had governed\r\nhim--possibly governed him too much; it had made him impatient of\r\nvulgar troubles and had led him to live by himself, in a sorted, sifted,\r\narranged world, thinking about art and beauty and history. He had\r\nconsulted his taste in everything--his taste alone perhaps, as a sick\r\nman consciously incurable consults at last only his lawyer: that was\r\nwhat made him so different from every one else. Ralph had something of\r\nthis same quality, this appearance of thinking that life was a matter\r\nof connoisseurship; but in Ralph it was an anomaly, a kind of humorous\r\nexcrescence, whereas in Mr. Osmond it was the keynote, and everything\r\nwas in harmony with it. She was certainly far from understanding him\r\ncompletely; his meaning was not at all times obvious. It was hard to see\r\nwhat he meant for instance by speaking of his provincial side--which\r\nwas exactly the side she would have taken him most to lack. Was it a\r\nharmless paradox, intended to puzzle her? or was it the last refinement\r\nof high culture? She trusted she should learn in time; it would be very\r\ninteresting to learn. If it was provincial to have that harmony, what\r\nthen was the finish of the capital? And she could put this question\r\nin spite of so feeling her host a shy personage; since such shyness as\r\nhis--the shyness of ticklish nerves and fine perceptions--was perfectly\r\nconsistent with the best breeding. Indeed it was almost a proof of\r\nstandards and touchstones other than the vulgar: he must be so sure the\r\nvulgar would be first on the ground. He wasn\'t a man of easy assurance,\r\nwho chatted and gossiped with the fluency of a superficial nature; he\r\nwas critical of himself as well as of others, and, exacting a good deal\r\nof others, to think them agreeable, probably took a rather ironical view\r\nof what he himself offered: a proof into the bargain that he was not\r\ngrossly conceited. If he had not been shy he wouldn\'t have effected that\r\ngradual, subtle, successful conversion of it to which she owed both what\r\npleased her in him and what mystified her. If he had suddenly asked her\r\nwhat she thought of the Countess Gemini, that was doubtless a proof that\r\nhe was interested in her; it could scarcely be as a help to knowledge\r\nof his own sister. That he should be so interested showed an enquiring\r\nmind; but it was a little singular he should sacrifice his fraternal\r\nfeeling to his curiosity. This was the most eccentric thing he had done.\r\n\r\nThere were two other rooms, beyond the one in which she had been\r\nreceived, equally full of romantic objects, and in these apartments\r\nIsabel spent a quarter of an hour. Everything was in the last degree\r\ncurious and precious, and Mr. Osmond continued to be the kindest of\r\nciceroni as he led her from one fine piece to another and still held his\r\nlittle girl by the hand. His kindness almost surprised our young friend,\r\nwho wondered why he should take so much trouble for her; and she was\r\noppressed at last with the accumulation of beauty and knowledge to which\r\nshe found herself introduced. There was enough for the present; she had\r\nceased to attend to what he said; she listened to him with attentive\r\neyes, but was not thinking of what he told her. He probably thought\r\nher quicker, cleverer in every way, more prepared, than she was. Madame\r\nMerle would have pleasantly exaggerated; which was a pity, because in\r\nthe end he would be sure to find out, and then perhaps even her real\r\nintelligence wouldn\'t reconcile him to his mistake. A part of Isabel\'s\r\nfatigue came from the effort to appear as intelligent as she believed\r\nMadame Merle had described her, and from the fear (very unusual with\r\nher) of exposing--not her ignorance; for that she cared comparatively\r\nlittle--but her possible grossness of perception. It would have annoyed\r\nher to express a liking for something he, in his superior enlightenment,\r\nwould think she oughtn\'t to like; or to pass by something at which the\r\ntruly initiated mind would arrest itself. She had no wish to fall into\r\nthat grotesqueness--in which she had seen women (and it was a warning)\r\nserenely, yet ignobly, flounder. She was very careful therefore as to\r\nwhat she said, as to what she noticed or failed to notice; more careful\r\nthan she had ever been before.\r\n\r\nThey came back into the first of the rooms, where the tea had been\r\nserved; but as the two other ladies were still on the terrace, and as\r\nIsabel had not yet been made acquainted with the view, the paramount\r\ndistinction of the place, Mr. Osmond directed her steps into the garden\r\nwithout more delay. Madame Merle and the Countess had had chairs brought\r\nout, and as the afternoon was lovely the Countess proposed they should\r\ntake their tea in the open air. Pansy therefore was sent to bid the\r\nservant bring out the preparations. The sun had got low, the golden\r\nlight took a deeper tone, and on the mountains and the plain that\r\nstretched beneath them the masses of purple shadow glowed as richly\r\nas the places that were still exposed. The scene had an extraordinary\r\ncharm. The air was almost solemnly still, and the large expanse of the\r\nlandscape, with its garden-like culture and nobleness of outline,\r\nits teeming valley and delicately-fretted hills, its peculiarly\r\nhuman-looking touches of habitation, lay there in splendid harmony and\r\nclassic grace. "You seem so well pleased that I think you can be trusted\r\nto come back," Osmond said as he led his companion to one of the angles\r\nof the terrace.\r\n\r\n"I shall certainly come back," she returned, "in spite of what you say\r\nabout its being bad to live in Italy. What was that you said about one\'s\r\nnatural mission? I wonder if I should forsake my natural mission if I\r\nwere to settle in Florence."\r\n\r\n"A woman\'s natural mission is to be where she\'s most appreciated."\r\n\r\n"The point\'s to find out where that is."\r\n\r\n"Very true--she often wastes a great deal of time in the enquiry. People\r\nought to make it very plain to her."\r\n\r\n"Such a matter would have to be made very plain to me," smiled Isabel.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad, at any rate, to hear you talk of settling. Madame Merle had\r\ngiven me an idea that you were of a rather roving disposition. I thought\r\nshe spoke of your having some plan of going round the world."\r\n\r\n"I\'m rather ashamed of my plans; I make a new one every day."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why you should be ashamed; it\'s the greatest of pleasures."\r\n\r\n"It seems frivolous, I think," said Isabel. "One ought to choose\r\nsomething very deliberately, and be faithful to that."\r\n\r\n"By that rule then, I\'ve not been frivolous."\r\n\r\n"Have you never made plans?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I made one years ago, and I\'m acting on it to-day."\r\n\r\n"It must have been a very pleasant one," Isabel permitted herself to\r\nobserve.\r\n\r\n"It was very simple. It was to be as quiet as possible."\r\n\r\n"As quiet?" the girl repeated.\r\n\r\n"Not to worry--not to strive nor struggle. To resign myself. To be\r\ncontent with little." He spoke these sentences slowly, with short pauses\r\nbetween, and his intelligent regard was fixed on his visitor\'s with the\r\nconscious air of a man who has brought himself to confess something.\r\n\r\n"Do you call that simple?" she asked with mild irony.\r\n\r\n"Yes, because it\'s negative."\r\n\r\n"Has your life been negative?"\r\n\r\n"Call it affirmative if you like. Only it has affirmed my indifference.\r\nMind you, not my natural indifference--I _had_ none. But my studied, my\r\nwilful renunciation."\r\n\r\nShe scarcely understood him; it seemed a question whether he were\r\njoking or not. Why should a man who struck her as having a great fund\r\nof reserve suddenly bring himself to be so confidential? This was his\r\naffair, however, and his confidences were interesting. "I don\'t see why\r\nyou should have renounced," she said in a moment.\r\n\r\n"Because I could do nothing. I had no prospects, I was poor, and I was\r\nnot a man of genius. I had no talents even; I took my measure early in\r\nlife. I was simply the most fastidious young gentleman living. There\r\nwere two or three people in the world I envied--the Emperor of Russia,\r\nfor instance, and the Sultan of Turkey! There were even moments when I\r\nenvied the Pope of Rome--for the consideration he enjoys. I should have\r\nbeen delighted to be considered to that extent; but since that couldn\'t\r\nbe I didn\'t care for anything less, and I made up my mind not to go\r\nin for honours. The leanest gentleman can always consider himself,\r\nand fortunately I _was_, though lean, a gentleman. I could do nothing in\r\nItaly--I couldn\'t even be an Italian patriot. To do that I should have\r\nhad to get out of the country; and I was too fond of it to leave it, to\r\nsay nothing of my being too well satisfied with it, on the whole, as it\r\nthen was, to wish it altered. So I\'ve passed a great many years here on\r\nthat quiet plan I spoke of. I\'ve not been at all unhappy. I don\'t mean\r\nto say I\'ve cared for nothing; but the things I\'ve cared for have\r\nbeen definite--limited. The events of my life have been absolutely\r\nunperceived by any one save myself; getting an old silver crucifix at a\r\nbargain (I\'ve never bought anything dear, of course), or discovering,\r\nas I once did, a sketch by Correggio on a panel daubed over by some\r\ninspired idiot."\r\n\r\nThis would have been rather a dry account of Mr. Osmond\'s career if\r\nIsabel had fully believed it; but her imagination supplied the human\r\nelement which she was sure had not been wanting. His life had been\r\nmingled with other lives more than he admitted; naturally she couldn\'t\r\nexpect him to enter into this. For the present she abstained from\r\nprovoking further revelations; to intimate that he had not told her\r\neverything would be more familiar and less considerate than she now\r\ndesired to be--would in fact be uproariously vulgar. He had certainly\r\ntold her quite enough. It was her present inclination, however, to\r\nexpress a measured sympathy for the success with which he had preserved\r\nhis independence. "That\'s a very pleasant life," she said, "to renounce\r\neverything but Correggio!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ve made in my way a good thing of it. Don\'t imagine I\'m whining\r\nabout it. It\'s one\'s own fault if one isn\'t happy."\r\n\r\nThis was large; she kept down to something smaller. "Have you lived here\r\nalways?"\r\n\r\n"No, not always. I lived a long time at Naples, and many years in\r\nRome. But I\'ve been here a good while. Perhaps I shall have to change,\r\nhowever; to do something else. I\'ve no longer myself to think of. My\r\ndaughter\'s growing up and may very possibly not care so much for the\r\nCorreggios and crucifixes as I. I shall have to do what\'s best for\r\nPansy."\r\n\r\n"Yes, do that," said Isabel. "She\'s such a dear little girl."\r\n\r\n"Ah," cried Gilbert Osmond beautifully, "she\'s a little saint of heaven!\r\nShe is my great happiness!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nWhile this sufficiently intimate colloquy (prolonged for some time after\r\nwe cease to follow it) went forward Madame Merle and her companion,\r\nbreaking a silence of some duration, had begun to exchange remarks.\r\nThey were sitting in an attitude of unexpressed expectancy; an attitude\r\nespecially marked on the part of the Countess Gemini, who, being of a\r\nmore nervous temperament than her friend, practised with less success\r\nthe art of disguising impatience. What these ladies were waiting for\r\nwould not have been apparent and was perhaps not very definite to their\r\nown minds. Madame Merle waited for Osmond to release their young friend\r\nfrom her _t\xeate-\xe0-t\xeate_, and the Countess waited because Madame Merle did.\r\nThe Countess, moreover, by waiting, found the time ripe for one of her\r\npretty perversities. She might have desired for some minutes to place\r\nit. Her brother wandered with Isabel to the end of the garden, to which\r\npoint her eyes followed them.\r\n\r\n"My dear," she then observed to her companion, "you\'ll excuse me if I\r\ndon\'t congratulate you!"\r\n\r\n"Very willingly, for I don\'t in the least know why you should."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you a little plan that you think rather well of?" And the\r\nCountess nodded at the sequestered couple.\r\n\r\nMadame Merle\'s eyes took the same direction; then she looked serenely at\r\nher neighbour. "You know I never understand you very well," she smiled.\r\n\r\n"No one can understand better than you when you wish. I see that just\r\nnow you _don\'t_ wish."\r\n\r\n"You say things to me that no one else does," said Madame Merle gravely,\r\nyet without bitterness.\r\n\r\n"You mean things you don\'t like? Doesn\'t Osmond sometimes say such\r\nthings?"\r\n\r\n"What your brother says has a point."\r\n\r\n"Yes, a poisoned one sometimes. If you mean that I\'m not so clever as he\r\nyou mustn\'t think I shall suffer from your sense of our difference. But\r\nit will be much better that you should understand me."\r\n\r\n"Why so?" asked Madame Merle. "To what will it conduce?"\r\n\r\n"If I don\'t approve of your plan you ought to know it in order to\r\nappreciate the danger of my interfering with it."\r\n\r\nMadame Merle looked as if she were ready to admit that there might be\r\nsomething in this; but in a moment she said quietly: "You think me more\r\ncalculating than I am."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not your calculating I think ill of; it\'s your calculating wrong.\r\nYou\'ve done so in this case."\r\n\r\n"You must have made extensive calculations yourself to discover that."\r\n\r\n"No, I\'ve not had time. I\'ve seen the girl but this once," said the\r\nCountess, "and the conviction has suddenly come to me. I like her very\r\nmuch."\r\n\r\n"So do I," Madame Merle mentioned.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve a strange way of showing it."\r\n\r\n"Surely I\'ve given her the advantage of making your acquaintance."\r\n\r\n"That indeed," piped the Countess, "is perhaps the best thing that could\r\nhappen to her!"\r\n\r\nMadame Merle said nothing for some time. The Countess\'s manner was\r\nodious, was really low; but it was an old story, and with her eyes upon\r\nthe violet slope of Monte Morello she gave herself up to reflection. "My\r\ndear lady," she finally resumed, "I advise you not to agitate yourself.\r\nThe matter you allude to concerns three persons much stronger of purpose\r\nthan yourself."\r\n\r\n"Three persons? You and Osmond of course. But is Miss Archer also very\r\nstrong of purpose?"\r\n\r\n"Quite as much so as we."\r\n\r\n"Ah then," said the Countess radiantly, "if I convince her it\'s her\r\ninterest to resist you she\'ll do so successfully!"\r\n\r\n"Resist us? Why do you express yourself so coarsely? She\'s not exposed\r\nto compulsion or deception."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not sure of that. You\'re capable of anything, you and Osmond. I\r\ndon\'t mean Osmond by himself, and I don\'t mean you by yourself. But\r\ntogether you\'re dangerous--like some chemical combination."\r\n\r\n"You had better leave us alone then," smiled Madame Merle.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean to touch you--but I shall talk to that girl."\r\n\r\n"My poor Amy," Madame Merle murmured, "I don\'t see what has got into\r\nyour head."\r\n\r\n"I take an interest in her--that\'s what has got into my head. I like\r\nher."\r\n\r\nMadame Merle hesitated a moment. "I don\'t think she likes you."\r\n\r\nThe Countess\'s bright little eyes expanded and her face was set in a\r\ngrimace. "Ah, you _are_ dangerous--even by yourself!"\r\n\r\n"If you want her to like you don\'t abuse your brother to her," said\r\nMadame Merle.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose you pretend she has fallen in love with him in two\r\ninterviews."\r\n\r\nMadame Merle looked a moment at Isabel and at the master of the house.\r\nHe was leaning against the parapet, facing her, his arms folded; and\r\nshe at present was evidently not lost in the mere impersonal view,\r\npersistently as she gazed at it. As Madame Merle watched her she lowered\r\nher eyes; she was listening, possibly with a certain embarrassment,\r\nwhile she pressed the point of her parasol into the path. Madame Merle\r\nrose from her chair. "Yes, I think so!" she pronounced.\r\n\r\nThe shabby footboy, summoned by Pansy--he might, tarnished as to livery\r\nand quaint as to type, have issued from some stray sketch of old-time\r\nmanners, been "put in" by the brush of a Longhi or a Goya--had come out\r\nwith a small table and placed it on the grass, and then had gone back\r\nand fetched the tea-tray; after which he had again disappeared, to\r\nreturn with a couple of chairs. Pansy had watched these proceedings with\r\nthe deepest interest, standing with her small hands folded together\r\nupon the front of her scanty frock; but she had not presumed to offer\r\nassistance. When the tea-table had been arranged, however, she gently\r\napproached her aunt.\r\n\r\n"Do you think papa would object to my making the tea?"\r\n\r\nThe Countess looked at her with a deliberately critical gaze and without\r\nanswering her question. "My poor niece," she said, "is that your best\r\nfrock?"\r\n\r\n"Ah no," Pansy answered, "it\'s just a little toilette for common\r\noccasions."\r\n\r\n"Do you call it a common occasion when I come to see you?--to say\r\nnothing of Madame Merle and the pretty lady yonder."\r\n\r\nPansy reflected a moment, turning gravely from one of the persons\r\nmentioned to the other. Then her face broke into its perfect smile.\r\n"I have a pretty dress, but even that one\'s very simple. Why should I\r\nexpose it beside your beautiful things?"\r\n\r\n"Because it\'s the prettiest you have; for me you must always wear the\r\nprettiest. Please put it on the next time. It seems to me they don\'t\r\ndress you so well as they might."\r\n\r\nThe child sparingly stroked down her antiquated skirt. "It\'s a good\r\nlittle dress to make tea--don\'t you think? Don\'t you believe papa would\r\nallow me?"\r\n\r\n"Impossible for me to say, my child," said the Countess. "For me, your\r\nfather\'s ideas are unfathomable. Madame Merle understands them better.\r\nAsk _her_."\r\n\r\nMadame Merle smiled with her usual grace. "It\'s a weighty question--let\r\nme think. It seems to me it would please your father to see a careful\r\nlittle daughter making his tea. It\'s the proper duty of the daughter of\r\nthe house--when she grows up."\r\n\r\n"So it seems to me, Madame Merle!" Pansy cried. "You shall see how well\r\nI\'ll make it. A spoonful for each." And she began to busy herself at the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n"Two spoonfuls for me," said the Countess, who, with Madame Merle,\r\nremained for some moments watching her. "Listen to me, Pansy," the\r\nCountess resumed at last. "I should like to know what you think of your\r\nvisitor."\r\n\r\n"Ah, she\'s not mine--she\'s papa\'s," Pansy objected.\r\n\r\n"Miss Archer came to see you as well," said Madame Merle.\r\n\r\n"I\'m very happy to hear that. She has been very polite to me."\r\n\r\n"Do you like her then?" the Countess asked.\r\n\r\n"She\'s charming--charming," Pansy repeated in her little neat\r\nconversational tone. "She pleases me thoroughly."\r\n\r\n"And how do you think she pleases your father?"\r\n\r\n"Ah really, Countess!" murmured Madame Merle dissuasively. "Go and call\r\nthem to tea," she went on to the child.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll see if they don\'t like it!" Pansy declared; and departed to\r\nsummon the others, who had still lingered at the end of the terrace.\r\n\r\n"If Miss Archer\'s to become her mother it\'s surely interesting to know\r\nif the child likes her," said the Countess.\r\n\r\n"If your brother marries again it won\'t be for Pansy\'s sake," Madame\r\nMerle replied. "She\'ll soon be sixteen, and after that she\'ll begin to\r\nneed a husband rather than a stepmother."\r\n\r\n"And will you provide the husband as well?"\r\n\r\n"I shall certainly take an interest in her marrying fortunately. I\r\nimagine you\'ll do the same."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I shan\'t!" cried the Countess. "Why should I, of all women, set\r\nsuch a price on a husband?"\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t marry fortunately; that\'s what I\'m speaking of. When I say a\r\nhusband I mean a good one."\r\n\r\n"There are no good ones. Osmond won\'t be a good one."\r\n\r\nMadame Merle closed her eyes a moment. "You\'re irritated just now; I\r\ndon\'t know why," she presently said. "I don\'t think you\'ll really object\r\neither to your brother\'s or to your niece\'s marrying, when the time\r\ncomes for them to do so; and as regards Pansy I\'m confident that we\r\nshall some day have the pleasure of looking for a husband for her\r\ntogether. Your large acquaintance will be a great help."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m irritated," the Countess answered. "You often irritate me.\r\nYour own coolness is fabulous. You\'re a strange woman."\r\n\r\n"It\'s much better that we should always act together," Madame Merle went\r\non.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that as a threat?" asked the Countess rising. Madame\r\nMerle shook her head as for quiet amusement. "No indeed, you\'ve not my\r\ncoolness!"\r\n\r\nIsabel and Mr. Osmond were now slowly coming toward them and Isabel\r\nhad taken Pansy by the hand. "Do you pretend to believe he\'d make her\r\nhappy?" the Countess demanded.\r\n\r\n"If he should marry Miss Archer I suppose he\'d behave like a gentleman."\r\n\r\nThe Countess jerked herself into a succession of attitudes. "Do you\r\nmean as most gentlemen behave? That would be much to be thankful for! Of\r\ncourse Osmond\'s a gentleman; his own sister needn\'t be reminded of that.\r\nBut does he think he can marry any girl he happens to pick out? Osmond\'s\r\na gentleman, of course; but I must say I\'ve _never_, no, no, never, seen\r\nany one of Osmond\'s pretensions! What they\'re all founded on is more\r\nthan I can say. I\'m his own sister; I might be supposed to know. Who\r\nis he, if you please? What has he ever done? If there had been anything\r\nparticularly grand in his origin--if he were made of some superior\r\nclay--I presume I should have got some inkling of it. If there had been\r\nany great honours or splendours in the family I should certainly have\r\nmade the most of them: they would have been quite in my line. But\r\nthere\'s nothing, nothing, nothing. One\'s parents were charming people of\r\ncourse; but so were yours, I\'ve no doubt. Every one\'s a charming person\r\nnowadays. Even I\'m a charming person; don\'t laugh, it has literally\r\nbeen said. As for Osmond, he has always appeared to believe that he\'s\r\ndescended from the gods."\r\n\r\n"You may say what you please," said Madame Merle, who had listened to\r\nthis quick outbreak none the less attentively, we may believe, because\r\nher eye wandered away from the speaker and her hands busied themselves\r\nwith adjusting the knots of ribbon on her dress. "You Osmonds are a fine\r\nrace--your blood must flow from some very pure source. Your brother,\r\nlike an intelligent man, has had the conviction of it if he has not\r\nhad the proofs. You\'re modest about it, but you yourself are extremely\r\ndistinguished. What do you say about your niece? The child\'s a little\r\nprincess. Nevertheless," Madame Merle added, "it won\'t be an easy matter\r\nfor Osmond to marry Miss Archer. Yet he can try."\r\n\r\n"I hope she\'ll refuse him. It will take him down a little."\r\n\r\n"We mustn\'t forget that he is one of the cleverest of men."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve heard you say that before, but I haven\'t yet discovered what he\r\nhas done."\r\n\r\n"What he has done? He has done nothing that has had to be undone. And he\r\nhas known how to wait."\r\n\r\n"To wait for Miss Archer\'s money? How much of it is there?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s not what I mean," said Madame Merle. "Miss Archer has seventy\r\nthousand pounds."\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s a pity she\'s so charming," the Countess declared. "To be\r\nsacrificed, any girl would do. She needn\'t be superior."\r\n\r\n"If she weren\'t superior your brother would never look at her. He must\r\nhave the best."\r\n\r\n"Yes," returned the Countess as they went forward a little to meet\r\nthe others, "he\'s very hard to satisfy. That makes me tremble for her\r\nhappiness!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nGilbert Osmond came to see Isabel again; that is he came to Palazzo\r\nCrescentini. He had other friends there as well, and to Mrs. Touchett\r\nand Madame Merle he was always impartially civil; but the former of\r\nthese ladies noted the fact that in the course of a fortnight he\r\ncalled five times, and compared it with another fact that she found no\r\ndifficulty in remembering. Two visits a year had hitherto constituted\r\nhis regular tribute to Mrs. Touchett\'s worth, and she had never\r\nobserved him select for such visits those moments, of almost periodical\r\nrecurrence, when Madame Merle was under her roof. It was not for Madame\r\nMerle that he came; these two were old friends and he never put himself\r\nout for her. He was not fond of Ralph--Ralph had told her so--and it was\r\nnot supposable that Mr. Osmond had suddenly taken a fancy to her son.\r\nRalph was imperturbable--Ralph had a kind of loose-fitting urbanity\r\nthat wrapped him about like an ill-made overcoat, but of which he\r\nnever divested himself; he thought Mr. Osmond very good company and was\r\nwilling at any time to look at him in the light of hospitality. But he\r\ndidn\'t flatter himself that the desire to repair a past injustice was\r\nthe motive of their visitor\'s calls; he read the situation more clearly.\r\nIsabel was the attraction, and in all conscience a sufficient one.\r\nOsmond was a critic, a student of the exquisite, and it was natural he\r\nshould be curious of so rare an apparition. So when his mother observed\r\nto him that it was plain what Mr. Osmond was thinking of, Ralph replied\r\nthat he was quite of her opinion. Mrs. Touchett had from far back found\r\na place on her scant list for this gentleman, though wondering dimly by\r\nwhat art and what process--so negative and so wise as they were--he\r\nhad everywhere effectively imposed himself. As he had never been an\r\nimportunate visitor he had had no chance to be offensive, and he was\r\nrecommended to her by his appearance of being as well able to do without\r\nher as she was to do without him--a quality that always, oddly enough,\r\naffected her as providing ground for a relation with her. It gave her\r\nno satisfaction, however, to think that he had taken it into his head to\r\nmarry her niece. Such an alliance, on Isabel\'s part, would have an air\r\nof almost morbid perversity. Mrs. Touchett easily remembered that the\r\ngirl had refused an English peer; and that a young lady with whom Lord\r\nWarburton had not successfully wrestled should content herself with an\r\nobscure American dilettante, a middle-aged widower with an uncanny child\r\nand an ambiguous income, this answered to nothing in Mrs. Touchett\'s\r\nconception of success. She took, it will be observed, not the\r\nsentimental, but the political, view of matrimony--a view which has\r\nalways had much to recommend it. "I trust she won\'t have the folly\r\nto listen to him," she said to her son; to which Ralph replied that\r\nIsabel\'s listening was one thing and Isabel\'s answering quite another.\r\nHe knew she had listened to several parties, as his father would\r\nhave said, but had made them listen in return; and he found much\r\nentertainment in the idea that in these few months of his knowing her he\r\nshould observe a fresh suitor at her gate. She had wanted to see life,\r\nand fortune was serving her to her taste; a succession of fine gentlemen\r\ngoing down on their knees to her would do as well as anything else.\r\nRalph looked forward to a fourth, a fifth, a tenth besieger; he had no\r\nconviction she would stop at a third. She would keep the gate ajar and\r\nopen a parley; she would certainly not allow number three to come in.\r\nHe expressed this view, somewhat after this fashion, to his mother, who\r\nlooked at him as if he had been dancing a jig. He had such a fanciful,\r\npictorial way of saying things that he might as well address her in the\r\ndeaf-mute\'s alphabet.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I know what you mean," she said; "you use too many\r\nfigures of speech; I could never understand allegories. The two words in\r\nthe language I most respect are Yes and No. If Isabel wants to marry Mr.\r\nOsmond she\'ll do so in spite of all your comparisons. Let her alone to\r\nfind a fine one herself for anything she undertakes. I know very little\r\nabout the young man in America; I don\'t think she spends much of her\r\ntime in thinking of him, and I suspect he has got tired of waiting for\r\nher. There\'s nothing in life to prevent her marrying Mr. Osmond if\r\nshe only looks at him in a certain way. That\'s all very well; no one\r\napproves more than I of one\'s pleasing one\'s self. But she takes her\r\npleasure in such odd things; she\'s capable of marrying Mr. Osmond for\r\nthe beauty of his opinions or for his autograph of Michael Angelo.\r\nShe wants to be disinterested: as if she were the only person who\'s\r\nin danger of not being so! Will _he_ be so disinterested when he has the\r\nspending of her money? That was her idea before your father\'s death, and\r\nit has acquired new charms for her since. She ought to marry some one of\r\nwhose disinterestedness she shall herself be sure; and there would be no\r\nsuch proof of that as his having a fortune of his own."\r\n\r\n"My dear mother, I\'m not afraid," Ralph answered. "She\'s making fools of\r\nus all. She\'ll please herself, of course; but she\'ll do so by studying\r\nhuman nature at close quarters and yet retaining her liberty. She has\r\nstarted on an exploring expedition, and I don\'t think she\'ll change her\r\ncourse, at the outset, at a signal from Gilbert Osmond. She may have\r\nslackened speed for an hour, but before we know it she\'ll be steaming\r\naway again. Excuse another metaphor."\r\n\r\nMrs. Touchett excused it perhaps, but was not so much reassured as to\r\nwithhold from Madame Merle the expression of her fears. "You who\r\nknow everything," she said, "you must know this: whether that curious\r\ncreature\'s really making love to my niece."\r\n\r\n"Gilbert Osmond?" Madame Merle widened her clear eyes and, with a full\r\nintelligence, "Heaven help us," she exclaimed, "that\'s an idea!"\r\n\r\n"Hadn\'t it occurred to you?"\r\n\r\n"You make me feel an idiot, but I confess it hadn\'t. I wonder," she\r\nadded, "if it has occurred to Isabel."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I shall now ask her," said Mrs. Touchett.\r\n\r\nMadame Merle reflected. "Don\'t put it into her head. The thing would be\r\nto ask Mr. Osmond."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t do that," said Mrs. Touchett. "I won\'t have him enquire\r\nof me--as he perfectly may with that air of his, given Isabel\'s\r\nsituation--what business it is of mine."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll ask him myself," Madame Merle bravely declared.\r\n\r\n"But what business--for _him_--is it of yours?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s being none whatever is just why I can afford to speak. It\'s so\r\nmuch less my business than any one\'s else that he can put me off with\r\nanything he chooses. But it will be by the way he does this that I shall\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"Pray let me hear then," said Mrs. Touchett, "of the fruits of your\r\npenetration. If I can\'t speak to him, however, at least I can speak to\r\nIsabel."\r\n\r\nHer companion sounded at this the note of warning. "Don\'t be too quick\r\nwith her. Don\'t inflame her imagination."\r\n\r\n"I never did anything in life to any one\'s imagination. But I\'m always\r\nsure of her doing something--well, not of _my_ kind."\r\n\r\n"No, you wouldn\'t like this," Madame Merle observed without the point of\r\ninterrogation.\r\n\r\n"Why in the world should I, pray? Mr. Osmond has nothing the least solid\r\nto offer."\r\n\r\nAgain Madame Merle was silent while her thoughtful smile drew up her\r\nmouth even more charmingly than usual toward the left corner. "Let us\r\ndistinguish. Gilbert Osmond\'s certainly not the first comer. He\'s a man\r\nwho in favourable conditions might very well make a great impression. He\r\nhas made a great impression, to my knowledge, more than once."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell me about his probably quite cold-blooded love-affairs;\r\nthey\'re nothing to me!" Mrs. Touchett cried. "What you say\'s precisely\r\nwhy I wish he would cease his visits. He has nothing in the world that\r\nI know of but a dozen or two of early masters and a more or less pert\r\nlittle daughter."\r\n\r\n"The early masters are now worth a good deal of money," said Madame\r\nMerle, "and the daughter\'s a very young and very innocent and very\r\nharmless person."\r\n\r\n"In other words she\'s an insipid little chit. Is that what you mean?\r\nHaving no fortune she can\'t hope to marry as they marry here; so that\r\nIsabel will have to furnish her either with a maintenance or with a\r\ndowry."\r\n\r\n"Isabel probably wouldn\'t object to being kind to her. I think she likes\r\nthe poor child."\r\n\r\n"Another reason then for Mr. Osmond\'s stopping at home! Otherwise, a\r\nweek hence, we shall have my niece arriving at the conviction that her\r\nmission in life\'s to prove that a stepmother may sacrifice herself--and\r\nthat, to prove it, she must first become one."\r\n\r\n"She would make a charming stepmother," smiled Madame Merle; "but I\r\nquite agree with you that she had better not decide upon her mission\r\ntoo hastily. Changing the form of one\'s mission\'s almost as difficult as\r\nchanging the shape of one\'s nose: there they are, each, in the middle of\r\none\'s face and one\'s character--one has to begin too far back. But I\'ll\r\ninvestigate and report to you."\r\n\r\nAll this went on quite over Isabel\'s head; she had no suspicions that\r\nher relations with Mr. Osmond were being discussed. Madame Merle had\r\nsaid nothing to put her on her guard; she alluded no more pointedly to\r\nhim than to the other gentlemen of Florence, native and foreign, who now\r\narrived in considerable numbers to pay their respects to Miss Archer\'s\r\naunt. Isabel thought him interesting--she came back to that; she liked\r\nso to think of him. She had carried away an image from her visit to his\r\nhill-top which her subsequent knowledge of him did nothing to efface\r\nand which put on for her a particular harmony with other supposed\r\nand divined things, histories within histories: the image of a quiet,\r\nclever, sensitive, distinguished man, strolling on a moss-grown terrace\r\nabove the sweet Val d\'Arno and holding by the hand a little girl whose\r\nbell-like clearness gave a new grace to childhood. The picture had no\r\nflourishes, but she liked its lowness of tone and the atmosphere of\r\nsummer twilight that pervaded it. It spoke of the kind of personal issue\r\nthat touched her most nearly; of the choice between objects, subjects,\r\ncontacts--what might she call them?--of a thin and those of a rich\r\nassociation; of a lonely, studious life in a lovely land; of an old\r\nsorrow that sometimes ached to-day; of a feeling of pride that was\r\nperhaps exaggerated, but that had an element of nobleness; of a care\r\nfor beauty and perfection so natural and so cultivated together that the\r\ncareer appeared to stretch beneath it in the disposed vistas and with\r\nthe ranges of steps and terraces and fountains of a formal Italian\r\ngarden--allowing only for arid places freshened by the natural dews of\r\na quaint half-anxious, half-helpless fatherhood. At Palazzo Crescentini\r\nMr. Osmond\'s manner remained the same; diffident at first--oh\r\nself-conscious beyond doubt! and full of the effort (visible only to a\r\nsympathetic eye) to overcome this disadvantage; an effort which\r\nusually resulted in a great deal of easy, lively, very positive, rather\r\naggressive, always suggestive talk. Mr. Osmond\'s talk was not injured by\r\nthe indication of an eagerness to shine; Isabel found no difficulty\r\nin believing that a person was sincere who had so many of the signs of\r\nstrong conviction--as for instance an explicit and graceful appreciation\r\nof anything that might be said on his own side of the question, said\r\nperhaps by Miss Archer in especial. What continued to please this young\r\nwoman was that while he talked so for amusement he didn\'t talk, as she\r\nhad heard people, for "effect." He uttered his ideas as if, odd as\r\nthey often appeared, he were used to them and had lived with them; old\r\npolished knobs and heads and handles, of precious substance, that could\r\nbe fitted if necessary to new walking-sticks--not switches plucked in\r\ndestitution from the common tree and then too elegantly waved about. One\r\nday he brought his small daughter with him, and she rejoiced to renew\r\nacquaintance with the child, who, as she presented her forehead to be\r\nkissed by every member of the circle, reminded her vividly of an ingenue\r\nin a French play. Isabel had never seen a little person of this pattern;\r\nAmerican girls were very different--different too were the maidens of\r\nEngland. Pansy was so formed and finished for her tiny place in the\r\nworld, and yet in imagination, as one could see, so innocent and\r\ninfantine. She sat on the sofa by Isabel; she wore a small grenadine\r\nmantle and a pair of the useful gloves that Madame Merle had given\r\nher--little grey gloves with a single button. She was like a sheet of\r\nblank paper--the ideal _jeune fille_ of foreign fiction. Isabel hoped that\r\nso fair and smooth a page would be covered with an edifying text.\r\n\r\nThe Countess Gemini also came to call upon her, but the Countess was\r\nquite another affair. She was by no means a blank sheet; she had been\r\nwritten over in a variety of hands, and Mrs. Touchett, who felt by no\r\nmeans honoured by her visit, pronounced that a number of unmistakeable\r\nblots were to be seen upon her surface. The Countess gave rise indeed to\r\nsome discussion between the mistress of the house and the visitor from\r\nRome, in which Madame Merle (who was not such a fool as to irritate\r\npeople by always agreeing with them) availed herself felicitously enough\r\nof that large licence of dissent which her hostess permitted as freely\r\nas she practised it. Mrs. Touchett had declared it a piece of audacity\r\nthat this highly compromised character should have presented herself at\r\nsuch a time of day at the door of a house in which she was esteemed so\r\nlittle as she must long have known herself to be at Palazzo Crescentini.\r\nIsabel had been made acquainted with the estimate prevailing under that\r\nroof: it represented Mr. Osmond\'s sister as a lady who had so mismanaged\r\nher improprieties that they had ceased to hang together at all--which\r\nwas at the least what one asked of such matters--and had become the mere\r\nfloating fragments of a wrecked renown, incommoding social circulation.\r\nShe had been married by her mother--a more administrative person, with\r\nan appreciation of foreign titles which the daughter, to do her justice,\r\nhad probably by this time thrown off--to an Italian nobleman who had\r\nperhaps given her some excuse for attempting to quench the consciousness\r\nof outrage. The Countess, however, had consoled herself outrageously,\r\nand the list of her excuses had now lost itself in the labyrinth of her\r\nadventures. Mrs. Touchett had never consented to receive her, though the\r\nCountess had made overtures of old. Florence was not an austere city;\r\nbut, as Mrs. Touchett said, she had to draw the line somewhere.\r\n\r\nMadame Merle defended the luckless lady with a great deal of zeal and\r\nwit. She couldn\'t see why Mrs. Touchett should make a scapegoat of a\r\nwoman who had really done no harm, who had only done good in the wrong\r\nway. One must certainly draw the line, but while one was about it one\r\nshould draw it straight: it was a very crooked chalk-mark that would\r\nexclude the Countess Gemini. In that case Mrs. Touchett had better\r\nshut up her house; this perhaps would be the best course so long as\r\nshe remained in Florence. One must be fair and not make arbitrary\r\ndifferences: the Countess had doubtless been imprudent, she had not been\r\nso clever as other women. She was a good creature, not clever at\r\nall; but since when had that been a ground of exclusion from the best\r\nsociety? For ever so long now one had heard nothing about her, and there\r\ncould be no better proof of her having renounced the error of her ways\r\nthan her desire to become a member of Mrs. Touchett\'s circle. Isabel\r\ncould contribute nothing to this interesting dispute, not even a patient\r\nattention; she contented herself with having given a friendly welcome to\r\nthe unfortunate lady, who, whatever her defects, had at least the merit\r\nof being Mr. Osmond\'s sister. As she liked the brother Isabel thought it\r\nproper to try and like the sister: in spite of the growing complexity of\r\nthings she was still capable of these primitive sequences. She had not\r\nreceived the happiest impression of the Countess on meeting her at the\r\nvilla, but was thankful for an opportunity to repair the accident.\r\nHad not Mr. Osmond remarked that she was a respectable person? To have\r\nproceeded from Gilbert Osmond this was a crude proposition, but Madame\r\nMerle bestowed upon it a certain improving polish. She told Isabel\r\nmore about the poor Countess than Mr. Osmond had done, and related the\r\nhistory of her marriage and its consequences. The Count was a member of\r\nan ancient Tuscan family, but of such small estate that he had been glad\r\nto accept Amy Osmond, in spite of the questionable beauty which had yet\r\nnot hampered her career, with the modest dowry her mother was able\r\nto offer--a sum about equivalent to that which had already formed her\r\nbrother\'s share of their patrimony. Count Gemini since then, however,\r\nhad inherited money, and now they were well enough off, as Italians\r\nwent, though Amy was horribly extravagant. The Count was a low-lived\r\nbrute; he had given his wife every pretext. She had no children; she had\r\nlost three within a year of their birth. Her mother, who had bristled\r\nwith pretensions to elegant learning and published descriptive poems and\r\ncorresponded on Italian subjects with the English weekly journals, her\r\nmother had died three years after the Countess\'s marriage, the father,\r\nlost in the grey American dawn of the situation, but reputed originally\r\nrich and wild, having died much earlier. One could see this in Gilbert\r\nOsmond, Madame Merle held--see that he had been brought up by a woman;\r\nthough, to do him justice, one would suppose it had been by a more\r\nsensible woman than the American Corinne, as Mrs. Osmond had liked to be\r\ncalled. She had brought her children to Italy after her husband\'s death,\r\nand Mrs. Touchett remembered her during the year that followed her\r\narrival. She thought her a horrible snob; but this was an irregularity\r\nof judgement on Mrs. Touchett\'s part, for she, like Mrs. Osmond,\r\napproved of political marriages. The Countess was very good company and\r\nnot really the featherhead she seemed; all one had to do with her was\r\nto observe the simple condition of not believing a word she said.\r\nMadame Merle had always made the best of her for her brother\'s sake;\r\nhe appreciated any kindness shown to Amy, because (if it had to be\r\nconfessed for him) he rather felt she let down their common name.\r\nNaturally he couldn\'t like her style, her shrillness, her egotism,\r\nher violations of taste and above all of truth: she acted badly on his\r\nnerves, she was not _his_ sort of woman. What was his sort of woman? Oh,\r\nthe very opposite of the Countess, a woman to whom the truth should be\r\nhabitually sacred. Isabel was unable to estimate the number of times her\r\nvisitor had, in half an hour, profaned it: the Countess indeed had\r\ngiven her an impression of rather silly sincerity. She had talked almost\r\nexclusively about herself; how much she should like to know Miss Archer;\r\nhow thankful she should be for a real friend; how base the people in\r\nFlorence were; how tired she was of the place; how much she should\r\nlike to live somewhere else--in Paris, in London, in Washington; how\r\nimpossible it was to get anything nice to wear in Italy except a little\r\nold lace; how dear the world was growing everywhere; what a life of\r\nsuffering and privation she had led. Madame Merle listened with interest\r\nto Isabel\'s account of this passage, but she had not needed it to feel\r\nexempt from anxiety. On the whole she was not afraid of the Countess,\r\nand she could afford to do what was altogether best--not to appear so.\r\n\r\nIsabel had meanwhile another visitor, whom it was not, even behind her\r\nback, so easy a matter to patronise. Henrietta Stackpole, who had left\r\nParis after Mrs. Touchett\'s departure for San Remo and had worked her\r\nway down, as she said, through the cities of North Italy, reached the\r\nbanks of the Arno about the middle of May. Madame Merle surveyed her\r\nwith a single glance, took her in from head to foot, and after a pang\r\nof despair determined to endure her. She determined indeed to delight\r\nin her. She mightn\'t be inhaled as a rose, but she might be grasped as\r\na nettle. Madame Merle genially squeezed her into insignificance, and\r\nIsabel felt that in foreseeing this liberality she had done justice to\r\nher friend\'s intelligence. Henrietta\'s arrival had been announced by\r\nMr. Bantling, who, coming down from Nice while she was at Venice, and\r\nexpecting to find her in Florence, which she had not yet reached, called\r\nat Palazzo Crescentini to express his disappointment. Henrietta\'s own\r\nadvent occurred two days later and produced in Mr. Bantling an emotion\r\namply accounted for by the fact that he had not seen her since the\r\ntermination of the episode at Versailles. The humorous view of his\r\nsituation was generally taken, but it was uttered only by Ralph\r\nTouchett, who, in the privacy of his own apartment, when Bantling smoked\r\na cigar there, indulged in goodness knew what strong comedy on the\r\nsubject of the all-judging one and her British backer. This gentleman\r\ntook the joke in perfectly good part and candidly confessed that he\r\nregarded the affair as a positive intellectual adventure. He liked\r\nMiss Stackpole extremely; he thought she had a wonderful head on her\r\nshoulders, and found great comfort in the society of a woman who was not\r\nperpetually thinking about what would be said and how what she did, how\r\nwhat they did--and they had done things!--would look. Miss Stackpole\r\nnever cared how anything looked, and, if she didn\'t care, pray why\r\nshould he? But his curiosity had been roused; he wanted awfully to see\r\nif she ever _would_ care. He was prepared to go as far as she--he didn\'t\r\nsee why he should break down first.\r\n\r\nHenrietta showed no signs of breaking down. Her prospects had brightened\r\non her leaving England, and she was now in the full enjoyment of her\r\ncopious resources. She had indeed been obliged to sacrifice her hopes\r\nwith regard to the inner life; the social question, on the Continent,\r\nbristled with difficulties even more numerous than those she had\r\nencountered in England. But on the Continent there was the outer\r\nlife, which was palpable and visible at every turn, and more easily\r\nconvertible to literary uses than the customs of those opaque islanders.\r\nOut of doors in foreign lands, as she ingeniously remarked, one seemed\r\nto see the right side of the tapestry; out of doors in England one\r\nseemed to see the wrong side, which gave one no notion of the figure.\r\nThe admission costs her historian a pang, but Henrietta, despairing of\r\nmore occult things, was now paying much attention to the outer life. She\r\nhad been studying it for two months at Venice, from which city she sent\r\nto the _Interviewer_ a conscientious account of the gondolas, the Piazza,\r\nthe Bridge of Sighs, the pigeons and the young boatman who chanted\r\nTasso. The _Interviewer_ was perhaps disappointed, but Henrietta was at\r\nleast seeing Europe. Her present purpose was to get down to Rome before\r\nthe malaria should come on--she apparently supposed that it began on a\r\nfixed day; and with this design she was to spend at present but few days\r\nin Florence. Mr. Bantling was to go with her to Rome, and she pointed\r\nout to Isabel that as he had been there before, as he was a military man\r\nand as he had had a classical education--he had been bred at Eton, where\r\nthey study nothing but Latin and Whyte-Melville, said Miss Stackpole--he\r\nwould be a most useful companion in the city of the Caesars. At this\r\njuncture Ralph had the happy idea of proposing to Isabel that she also,\r\nunder his own escort, should make a pilgrimage to Rome. She expected\r\nto pass a portion of the next winter there--that was very well; but\r\nmeantime there was no harm in surveying the field. There were ten days\r\nleft of the beautiful month of May--the most precious month of all\r\nto the true Rome-lover. Isabel would become a Rome-lover; that was a\r\nforegone conclusion. She was provided with a trusty companion of her\r\nown sex, whose society, thanks to the fact of other calls on this lady\'s\r\nattention, would probably not be oppressive. Madame Merle would remain\r\nwith Mrs. Touchett; she had left Rome for the summer and wouldn\'t\r\ncare to return. She professed herself delighted to be left at peace\r\nin Florence; she had locked up her apartment and sent her cook home to\r\nPalestrina. She urged Isabel, however, to assent to Ralph\'s proposal,\r\nand assured her that a good introduction to Rome was not a thing to\r\nbe despised. Isabel in truth needed no urging, and the party of four\r\narranged its little journey. Mrs. Touchett, on this occasion, had\r\nresigned herself to the absence of a duenna; we have seen that she\r\nnow inclined to the belief that her niece should stand alone. One of\r\nIsabel\'s preparations consisted of her seeing Gilbert Osmond before she\r\nstarted and mentioning her intention to him.\r\n\r\n"I should like to be in Rome with you," he commented. "I should like to\r\nsee you on that wonderful ground."\r\n\r\nShe scarcely faltered. "You might come then."\r\n\r\n"But you\'ll have a lot of people with you."\r\n\r\n"Ah," Isabel admitted, "of course I shall not be alone."\r\n\r\nFor a moment he said nothing more. "You\'ll like it," he went on at last.\r\n"They\'ve spoiled it, but you\'ll rave about it."\r\n\r\n"Ought I to dislike it because, poor old dear--the Niobe of Nations, you\r\nknow--it has been spoiled?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"No, I think not. It has been spoiled so often," he smiled. "If I were\r\nto go, what should I do with my little girl?"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you leave her at the villa?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that I like that--though there\'s a very good old woman who\r\nlooks after her. I can\'t afford a governess."\r\n\r\n"Bring her with you then," said Isabel promptly.\r\n\r\nMr. Osmond looked grave. "She has been in Rome all winter, at her\r\nconvent; and she\'s too young to make journeys of pleasure."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t like bringing her forward?" Isabel enquired.\r\n\r\n"No, I think young girls should be kept out of the world."\r\n\r\n"I was brought up on a different system."\r\n\r\n"You? Oh, with you it succeeded, because you--you were exceptional."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why," said Isabel, who, however, was not sure there was not\r\nsome truth in the speech.\r\n\r\nMr. Osmond didn\'t explain; he simply went on: "If I thought it would\r\nmake her resemble you to join a social group in Rome I\'d take her there\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t make her resemble me," said Isabel. "Keep her like herself."\r\n\r\n"I might send her to my sister," Mr. Osmond observed. He had almost\r\nthe air of asking advice; he seemed to like to talk over his domestic\r\nmatters with Miss Archer.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she concurred; "I think that wouldn\'t do much towards making her\r\nresemble me!"\r\n\r\nAfter she had left Florence Gilbert Osmond met Madame Merle at the\r\nCountess Gemini\'s. There were other people present; the Countess\'s\r\ndrawing-room was usually well filled, and the talk had been general,\r\nbut after a while Osmond left his place and came and sat on an ottoman\r\nhalf-behind, half-beside Madame Merle\'s chair. "She wants me to go to\r\nRome with her," he remarked in a low voice.\r\n\r\n"To go with her?"\r\n\r\n"To be there while she\'s there. She proposed it.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you mean that you proposed it and she assented."\r\n\r\n"Of course I gave her a chance. But she\'s encouraging--she\'s very\r\nencouraging."\r\n\r\n"I rejoice to hear it--but don\'t cry victory too soon. Of course you\'ll\r\ngo to Rome."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Osmond, "it makes one work, this idea of yours!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t pretend you don\'t enjoy it--you\'re very ungrateful. You\'ve not\r\nbeen so well occupied these many years."\r\n\r\n"The way you take it\'s beautiful," said Osmond. "I ought to be grateful\r\nfor that."\r\n\r\n"Not too much so, however," Madame Merle answered. She talked with\r\nher usual smile, leaning back in her chair and looking round the room.\r\n"You\'ve made a very good impression, and I\'ve seen for myself that\r\nyou\'ve received one. You\'ve not come to Mrs. Touchett\'s seven times to\r\noblige me."\r\n\r\n"The girl\'s not disagreeable," Osmond quietly conceded.\r\n\r\nMadame Merle dropped her eye on him a moment, during which her lips\r\nclosed with a certain firmness. "Is that all you can find to say about\r\nthat fine creature?"\r\n\r\n"All? Isn\'t it enough? Of how many people have you heard me say more?"\r\n\r\nShe made no answer to this, but still presented her talkative grace to\r\nthe room. "You\'re unfathomable," she murmured at last. "I\'m frightened\r\nat the abyss into which I shall have cast her."\r\n\r\nHe took it almost gaily. "You can\'t draw back--you\'ve gone too far."\r\n\r\n"Very good; but you must do the rest yourself."\r\n\r\n"I shall do it," said Gilbert Osmond.\r\n\r\nMadame Merle remained silent and he changed his place again; but when\r\nshe rose to go he also took leave. Mrs. Touchett\'s victoria was awaiting\r\nher guest in the court, and after he had helped his friend into it he\r\nstood there detaining her. "You\'re very indiscreet," she said rather\r\nwearily; "you shouldn\'t have moved when I did."\r\n\r\nHe had taken off his hat; he passed his hand over his forehead. "I\r\nalways forget; I\'m out of the habit."\r\n\r\n"You\'re quite unfathomable," she repeated, glancing up at the windows of\r\nthe house, a modern structure in the new part of the town.\r\n\r\nHe paid no heed to this remark, but spoke in his own sense. "She\'s\r\nreally very charming. I\'ve scarcely known any one more graceful."\r\n\r\n"It does me good to hear you say that. The better you like her the\r\nbetter for me."\r\n\r\n"I like her very much. She\'s all you described her, and into the bargain\r\ncapable, I feel, of great devotion. She has only one fault."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"Too many ideas."\r\n\r\n"I warned you she was clever."\r\n\r\n"Fortunately they\'re very bad ones," said Osmond.\r\n\r\n"Why is that fortunate?"\r\n\r\n"_Dame_, if they must be sacrificed!"\r\n\r\nMadame Merle leaned back, looking straight before her; then she spoke to\r\nthe coachman. But her friend again detained her. "If I go to Rome what\r\nshall I do with Pansy?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go and see her," said Madame Merle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nI may not attempt to report in its fulness our young woman\'s response\r\nto the deep appeal of Rome, to analyse her feelings as she trod the\r\npavement of the Forum or to number her pulsations as she crossed the\r\nthreshold of Saint Peter\'s. It is enough to say that her impression was\r\nsuch as might have been expected of a person of her freshness and her\r\neagerness. She had always been fond of history, and here was history\r\nin the stones of the street and the atoms of the sunshine. She had an\r\nimagination that kindled at the mention of great deeds, and wherever she\r\nturned some great deed had been acted. These things strongly moved her,\r\nbut moved her all inwardly. It seemed to her companions that she talked\r\nless than usual, and Ralph Touchett, when he appeared to be looking\r\nlistlessly and awkwardly over her head, was really dropping on her an\r\nintensity of observation. By her own measure she was very happy; she\r\nwould even have been willing to take these hours for the happiest she\r\nwas ever to know. The sense of the terrible human past was heavy to her,\r\nbut that of something altogether contemporary would suddenly give it\r\nwings that it could wave in the blue. Her consciousness was so mixed\r\nthat she scarcely knew where the different parts of it would lead her,\r\nand she went about in a repressed ecstasy of contemplation, seeing often\r\nin the things she looked at a great deal more than was there, and yet\r\nnot seeing many of the items enumerated in her Murray. Rome, as Ralph\r\nsaid, confessed to the psychological moment. The herd of reechoing\r\ntourists had departed and most of the solemn places had relapsed into\r\nsolemnity. The sky was a blaze of blue, and the plash of the fountains\r\nin their mossy niches had lost its chill and doubled its music. On the\r\ncorners of the warm, bright streets one stumbled on bundles of flowers.\r\nOur friends had gone one afternoon--it was the third of their stay--to\r\nlook at the latest excavations in the Forum, these labours having been\r\nfor some time previous largely extended. They had descended from the\r\nmodern street to the level of the Sacred Way, along which they wandered\r\nwith a reverence of step which was not the same on the part of each.\r\nHenrietta Stackpole was struck with the fact that ancient Rome had been\r\npaved a good deal like New York, and even found an analogy between the\r\ndeep chariot-ruts traceable in the antique street and the overjangled\r\niron grooves which express the intensity of American life. The sun had\r\nbegun to sink, the air was a golden haze, and the long shadows of broken\r\ncolumn and vague pedestal leaned across the field of ruin. Henrietta\r\nwandered away with Mr. Bantling, whom it was apparently delightful to\r\nher to hear speak of Julius Caesar as a "cheeky old boy," and Ralph\r\naddressed such elucidations as he was prepared to offer to the attentive\r\near of our heroine. One of the humble archeologists who hover about\r\nthe place had put himself at the disposal of the two, and repeated his\r\nlesson with a fluency which the decline of the season had done nothing\r\nto impair. A process of digging was on view in a remote corner of the\r\nForum, and he presently remarked that if it should please the _signori_\r\nto go and watch it a little they might see something of interest. The\r\nproposal commended itself more to Ralph than to Isabel, weary with much\r\nwandering; so that she admonished her companion to satisfy his curiosity\r\nwhile she patiently awaited his return. The hour and the place were much\r\nto her taste--she should enjoy being briefly alone. Ralph accordingly\r\nwent off with the cicerone while Isabel sat down on a prostrate column\r\nnear the foundations of the Capitol. She wanted a short solitude, but\r\nshe was not long to enjoy it. Keen as was her interest in the rugged\r\nrelics of the Roman past that lay scattered about her and in which the\r\ncorrosion of centuries had still left so much of individual life, her\r\nthoughts, after resting a while on these things, had wandered, by a\r\nconcatenation of stages it might require some subtlety to trace, to\r\nregions and objects charged with a more active appeal. From the Roman\r\npast to Isabel Archer\'s future was a long stride, but her imagination\r\nhad taken it in a single flight and now hovered in slow circles over\r\nthe nearer and richer field. She was so absorbed in her thoughts, as she\r\nbent her eyes upon a row of cracked but not dislocated slabs covering\r\nthe ground at her feet, that she had not heard the sound of approaching\r\nfootsteps before a shadow was thrown across the line of her vision. She\r\nlooked up and saw a gentleman--a gentleman who was not Ralph come back\r\nto say that the excavations were a bore. This personage was startled as\r\nshe was startled; he stood there baring his head to her perceptibly pale\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n"Lord Warburton!" Isabel exclaimed as she rose.\r\n\r\n"I had no idea it was you. I turned that corner and came upon you."\r\n\r\nShe looked about her to explain. "I\'m alone, but my companions have just\r\nleft me. My cousin\'s gone to look at the work over there."\r\n\r\n"Ah yes; I see." And Lord Warburton\'s eyes wandered vaguely in the\r\ndirection she had indicated. He stood firmly before her now; he had\r\nrecovered his balance and seemed to wish to show it, though very kindly.\r\n"Don\'t let me disturb you," he went on, looking at her dejected pillar.\r\n"I\'m afraid you\'re tired."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m rather tired." She hesitated a moment, but sat down again.\r\n"Don\'t let me interrupt you," she added.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, I\'m quite alone, I\'ve nothing on earth to do. I had no\r\nidea you were in Rome. I\'ve just come from the East. I\'m only passing\r\nthrough."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been making a long journey," said Isabel, who had learned from\r\nRalph that Lord Warburton was absent from England.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I came abroad for six months--soon after I saw you last. I\'ve been\r\nin Turkey and Asia Minor; I came the other day from Athens." He managed\r\nnot to be awkward, but he wasn\'t easy, and after a longer look at the\r\ngirl he came down to nature. "Do you wish me to leave you, or will you\r\nlet me stay a little?"\r\n\r\nShe took it all humanely. "I don\'t wish you to leave me, Lord Warburton;\r\nI\'m very glad to see you."\r\n\r\n"Thank you for saying that. May I sit down?"\r\n\r\nThe fluted shaft on which she had taken her seat would have afforded a\r\nresting-place to several persons, and there was plenty of room even for\r\na highly-developed Englishman. This fine specimen of that great class\r\nseated himself near our young lady, and in the course of five minutes he\r\nhad asked her several questions, taken rather at random and to which, as\r\nhe put some of them twice over, he apparently somewhat missed catching\r\nthe answer; had given her too some information about himself which was\r\nnot wasted upon her calmer feminine sense. He repeated more than once\r\nthat he had not expected to meet her, and it was evident that the\r\nencounter touched him in a way that would have made preparation\r\nadvisable. He began abruptly to pass from the impunity of things\r\nto their solemnity, and from their being delightful to their being\r\nimpossible. He was splendidly sunburnt; even his multitudinous beard had\r\nbeen burnished by the fire of Asia. He was dressed in the loose-fitting,\r\nheterogeneous garments in which the English traveller in foreign lands\r\nis wont to consult his comfort and affirm his nationality; and with\r\nhis pleasant steady eyes, his bronzed complexion, fresh beneath its\r\nseasoning, his manly figure, his minimising manner and his general air\r\nof being a gentleman and an explorer, he was such a representative of\r\nthe British race as need not in any clime have been disavowed by those\r\nwho have a kindness for it. Isabel noted these things and was glad she\r\nhad always liked him. He had kept, evidently in spite of shocks, every\r\none of his merits--properties these partaking of the essence of great\r\ndecent houses, as one might put it; resembling their innermost fixtures\r\nand ornaments, not subject to vulgar shifting and removable only by\r\nsome whole break-up. They talked of the matters naturally in order;\r\nher uncle\'s death, Ralph\'s state of health, the way she had passed her\r\nwinter, her visit to Rome, her return to Florence, her plans for the\r\nsummer, the hotel she was staying at; and then of Lord Warburton\'s own\r\nadventures, movements, intentions, impressions and present domicile. At\r\nlast there was a silence, and it said so much more than either had said\r\nthat it scarce needed his final words. "I\'ve written to you several\r\ntimes."\r\n\r\n"Written to me? I\'ve never had your letters."\r\n\r\n"I never sent them. I burned them up."\r\n\r\n"Ah," laughed Isabel, "it was better that you should do that than I!"\r\n\r\n"I thought you wouldn\'t care for them," he went on with a simplicity\r\nthat touched her. "It seemed to me that after all I had no right to\r\ntrouble you with letters."\r\n\r\n"I should have been very glad to have news of you. You know how I hoped\r\nthat--that--" But she stopped; there would be such a flatness in the\r\nutterance of her thought.\r\n\r\n"I know what you\'re going to say. You hoped we should always remain good\r\nfriends." This formula, as Lord Warburton uttered it, was certainly flat\r\nenough; but then he was interested in making it appear so.\r\n\r\nShe found herself reduced simply to "Please don\'t talk of all that"; a\r\nspeech which hardly struck her as improvement on the other.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a small consolation to allow me!" her companion exclaimed with\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t pretend to console you," said the girl, who, all still as\r\nshe sat there, threw herself back with a sort of inward triumph on\r\nthe answer that had satisfied him so little six months before. He was\r\npleasant, he was powerful, he was gallant; there was no better man than\r\nhe. But her answer remained.\r\n\r\n"It\'s very well you don\'t try to console me; it wouldn\'t be in your\r\npower," she heard him say through the medium of her strange elation.\r\n\r\n"I hoped we should meet again, because I had no fear you would attempt\r\nto make me feel I had wronged you. But when you do that--the pain\'s\r\ngreater than the pleasure." And she got up with a small conscious\r\nmajesty, looking for her companions.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to make you feel that; of course I can\'t say that. I only\r\njust want you to know one or two things--in fairness to myself, as it\r\nwere. I won\'t return to the subject again. I felt very strongly what I\r\nexpressed to you last year; I couldn\'t think of anything else. I tried\r\nto forget--energetically, systematically. I tried to take an interest in\r\nsomebody else. I tell you this because I want you to know I did my duty.\r\nI didn\'t succeed. It was for the same purpose I went abroad--as far\r\naway as possible. They say travelling distracts the mind, but it didn\'t\r\ndistract mine. I\'ve thought of you perpetually, ever since I last saw\r\nyou. I\'m exactly the same. I love you just as much, and everything I\r\nsaid to you then is just as true. This instant at which I speak to you\r\nshows me again exactly how, to my great misfortune, you just insuperably\r\ncharm me. There--I can\'t say less. I don\'t mean, however, to insist;\r\nit\'s only for a moment. I may add that when I came upon you a few\r\nminutes since, without the smallest idea of seeing you, I was, upon\r\nmy honour, in the very act of wishing I knew where you were." He had\r\nrecovered his self-control, and while he spoke it became complete. He\r\nmight have been addressing a small committee--making all quietly and\r\nclearly a statement of importance; aided by an occasional look at a\r\npaper of notes concealed in his hat, which he had not again put on. And\r\nthe committee, assuredly, would have felt the point proved.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve often thought of you, Lord Warburton," Isabel answered. "You may\r\nbe sure I shall always do that." And she added in a tone of which she\r\ntried to keep up the kindness and keep down the meaning: "There\'s no\r\nharm in that on either side."\r\n\r\nThey walked along together, and she was prompt to ask about his sisters\r\nand request him to let them know she had done so. He made for the moment\r\nno further reference to their great question, but dipped again into\r\nshallower and safer waters. But he wished to know when she was to leave\r\nRome, and on her mentioning the limit of her stay declared he was glad\r\nit was still so distant.\r\n\r\n"Why do you say that if you yourself are only passing through?" she\r\nenquired with some anxiety.\r\n\r\n"Ah, when I said I was passing through I didn\'t mean that one would\r\ntreat Rome as if it were Clapham Junction. To pass through Rome is to\r\nstop a week or two."\r\n\r\n"Say frankly that you mean to stay as long as I do!"\r\n\r\nHis flushed smile, for a little, seemed to sound her. "You won\'t like\r\nthat. You\'re afraid you\'ll see too much of me."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t matter what I like. I certainly can\'t expect you to leave\r\nthis delightful place on my account. But I confess I\'m afraid of you."\r\n\r\n"Afraid I\'ll begin again? I promise to be very careful."\r\n\r\nThey had gradually stopped and they stood a moment face to face. "Poor\r\nLord Warburton!" she said with a compassion intended to be good for both\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n"Poor Lord Warburton indeed! But I\'ll be careful."\r\n\r\n"You may be unhappy, but you shall not make _me_ so. That I can\'t allow."\r\n\r\n"If I believed I could make you unhappy I think I should try it." At\r\nthis she walked in advance and he also proceeded. "I\'ll never say a word\r\nto displease you."\r\n\r\n"Very good. If you do, our friendship\'s at an end."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps some day--after a while--you\'ll give me leave."\r\n\r\n"Give you leave to make me unhappy?"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated. "To tell you again--" But he checked himself. "I\'ll keep\r\nit down. I\'ll keep it down always."\r\n\r\nRalph Touchett had been joined in his visit to the excavation by Miss\r\nStackpole and her attendant, and these three now emerged from among the\r\nmounds of earth and stone collected round the aperture and came into\r\nsight of Isabel and her companion. Poor Ralph hailed his friend with joy\r\nqualified by wonder, and Henrietta exclaimed in a high voice "Gracious,\r\nthere\'s that lord!" Ralph and his English neighbour greeted with the\r\nausterity with which, after long separations, English neighbours greet,\r\nand Miss Stackpole rested her large intellectual gaze upon the sunburnt\r\ntraveller. But she soon established her relation to the crisis. "I don\'t\r\nsuppose you remember me, sir."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I do remember you," said Lord Warburton. "I asked you to come\r\nand see me, and you never came."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t go everywhere I\'m asked," Miss Stackpole answered coldly.\r\n\r\n"Ah well, I won\'t ask you again," laughed the master of Lockleigh.\r\n\r\n"If you do I\'ll go; so be sure!"\r\n\r\nLord Warburton, for all his hilarity, seemed sure enough. Mr. Bantling\r\nhad stood by without claiming a recognition, but he now took occasion\r\nto nod to his lordship, who answered him with a friendly "Oh, you here,\r\nBantling?" and a hand-shake.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Henrietta, "I didn\'t know you knew him!"\r\n\r\n"I guess you don\'t know every one I know," Mr. Bantling rejoined\r\nfacetiously.\r\n\r\n"I thought that when an Englishman knew a lord he always told you."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I\'m afraid Bantling was ashamed of me," Lord Warburton laughed\r\nagain. Isabel took pleasure in that note; she gave a small sigh of\r\nrelief as they kept their course homeward.\r\n\r\nThe next day was Sunday; she spent her morning over two long\r\nletters--one to her sister Lily, the other to Madame Merle; but in\r\nneither of these epistles did she mention the fact that a rejected\r\nsuitor had threatened her with another appeal. Of a Sunday afternoon\r\nall good Romans (and the best Romans are often the northern barbarians)\r\nfollow the custom of going to vespers at Saint Peter\'s; and it had been\r\nagreed among our friends that they would drive together to the great\r\nchurch. After lunch, an hour before the carriage came, Lord Warburton\r\npresented himself at the H\xf4tel de Paris and paid a visit to the two\r\nladies, Ralph Touchett and Mr. Bantling having gone out together. The\r\nvisitor seemed to have wished to give Isabel a proof of his intention to\r\nkeep the promise made her the evening before; he was both discreet and\r\nfrank--not even dumbly importunate or remotely intense. He thus left\r\nher to judge what a mere good friend he could be. He talked about his\r\ntravels, about Persia, about Turkey, and when Miss Stackpole asked him\r\nwhether it would "pay" for her to visit those countries assured her they\r\noffered a great field to female enterprise. Isabel did him justice, but\r\nshe wondered what his purpose was and what he expected to gain even by\r\nproving the superior strain of his sincerity. If he expected to melt\r\nher by showing what a good fellow he was, he might spare himself the\r\ntrouble. She knew the superior strain of everything about him, and\r\nnothing he could now do was required to light the view. Moreover\r\nhis being in Rome at all affected her as a complication of the wrong\r\nsort--she liked so complications of the right. Nevertheless, when, on\r\nbringing his call to a close, he said he too should be at Saint Peter\'s\r\nand should look out for her and her friends, she was obliged to reply\r\nthat he must follow his convenience.\r\n\r\nIn the church, as she strolled over its tesselated acres, he was the\r\nfirst person she encountered. She had not been one of the superior\r\ntourists who are "disappointed" in Saint Peter\'s and find it smaller\r\nthan its fame; the first time she passed beneath the huge leathern\r\ncurtain that strains and bangs at the entrance, the first time she found\r\nherself beneath the far-arching dome and saw the light drizzle down\r\nthrough the air thickened with incense and with the reflections of\r\nmarble and gilt, of mosaic and bronze, her conception of greatness rose\r\nand dizzily rose. After this it never lacked space to soar. She gazed\r\nand wondered like a child or a peasant, she paid her silent tribute to\r\nthe seated sublime. Lord Warburton walked beside her and talked of Saint\r\nSophia of Constantinople; she feared for instance that he would end\r\nby calling attention to his exemplary conduct. The service had not yet\r\nbegun, but at Saint Peter\'s there is much to observe, and as there is\r\nsomething almost profane in the vastness of the place, which seems meant\r\nas much for physical as for spiritual exercise, the different figures\r\nand groups, the mingled worshippers and spectators, may follow their\r\nvarious intentions without conflict or scandal. In that splendid\r\nimmensity individual indiscretion carries but a short distance. Isabel\r\nand her companions, however, were guilty of none; for though Henrietta\r\nwas obliged in candour to declare that Michael Angelo\'s dome suffered\r\nby comparison with that of the Capitol at Washington, she addressed\r\nher protest chiefly to Mr. Bantling\'s ear and reserved it in its more\r\naccentuated form for the columns of the _Interviewer_. Isabel made the\r\ncircuit of the church with his lordship, and as they drew near the choir\r\non the left of the entrance the voices of the Pope\'s singers were borne\r\nto them over the heads of the large number of persons clustered outside\r\nthe doors. They paused a while on the skirts of this crowd, composed\r\nin equal measure of Roman cockneys and inquisitive strangers, and while\r\nthey stood there the sacred concert went forward. Ralph, with Henrietta\r\nand Mr. Bantling, was apparently within, where Isabel, looking beyond\r\nthe dense group in front of her, saw the afternoon light, silvered by\r\nclouds of incense that seemed to mingle with the splendid chant, slope\r\nthrough the embossed recesses of high windows. After a while the singing\r\nstopped and then Lord Warburton seemed disposed to move off with her.\r\nIsabel could only accompany him; whereupon she found herself confronted\r\nwith Gilbert Osmond, who appeared to have been standing at a short\r\ndistance behind her. He now approached with all the forms--he appeared\r\nto have multiplied them on this occasion to suit the place.\r\n\r\n"So you decided to come?" she said as she put out her hand.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I came last night and called this afternoon at your hotel. They\r\ntold me you had come here, and I looked about for you."\r\n\r\n"The others are inside," she decided to say.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t come for the others," he promptly returned.\r\n\r\nShe looked away; Lord Warburton was watching them; perhaps he had heard\r\nthis. Suddenly she remembered it to be just what he had said to her the\r\nmorning he came to Gardencourt to ask her to marry him. Mr. Osmond\'s\r\nwords had brought the colour to her cheek, and this reminiscence had not\r\nthe effect of dispelling it. She repaired any betrayal by mentioning to\r\neach companion the name of the other, and fortunately at this moment Mr.\r\nBantling emerged from the choir, cleaving the crowd with British valour\r\nand followed by Miss Stackpole and Ralph Touchett. I say fortunately,\r\nbut this is perhaps a superficial view of the matter; since on\r\nperceiving the gentleman from Florence Ralph Touchett appeared to take\r\nthe case as not committing him to joy. He didn\'t hang back, however,\r\nfrom civility, and presently observed to Isabel, with due benevolence,\r\nthat she would soon have all her friends about her. Miss Stackpole had\r\nmet Mr. Osmond in Florence, but she had already found occasion to say\r\nto Isabel that she liked him no better than her other admirers--than Mr.\r\nTouchett and Lord Warburton, and even than little Mr. Rosier in Paris.\r\n"I don\'t know what it\'s in you," she had been pleased to remark, "but\r\nfor a nice girl you do attract the most unnatural people. Mr. Goodwood\'s\r\nthe only one I\'ve any respect for, and he\'s just the one you don\'t\r\nappreciate."\r\n\r\n"What\'s your opinion of Saint Peter\'s?" Mr. Osmond was meanwhile\r\nenquiring of our young lady.\r\n\r\n"It\'s very large and very bright," she contented herself with replying.\r\n\r\n"It\'s too large; it makes one feel like an atom."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t that the right way to feel in the greatest of human temples?" she\r\nasked with rather a liking for her phrase.\r\n\r\n"I suppose it\'s the right way to feel everywhere, when one _is_ nobody.\r\nBut I like it in a church as little as anywhere else."\r\n\r\n"You ought indeed to be a Pope!" Isabel exclaimed, remembering something\r\nhe had referred to in Florence.\r\n\r\n"Ah, I should have enjoyed that!" said Gilbert Osmond.\r\n\r\nLord Warburton meanwhile had joined Ralph Touchett, and the two strolled\r\naway together. "Who\'s the fellow speaking to Miss Archer?" his lordship\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\n"His name\'s Gilbert Osmond--he lives in Florence," Ralph said.\r\n\r\n"What is he besides?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing at all. Oh yes, he\'s an American; but one forgets that--he\'s so\r\nlittle of one."\r\n\r\n"Has he known Miss Archer long?"\r\n\r\n"Three or four weeks."\r\n\r\n"Does she like him?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s trying to find out."\r\n\r\n"And will she?"\r\n\r\n"Find out--?" Ralph asked.\r\n\r\n"Will she like him?"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean will she accept him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Lord Warburton after an instant; "I suppose that\'s what I\r\nhorribly mean."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not if one does nothing to prevent it," Ralph replied.\r\n\r\nHis lordship stared a moment, but apprehended. "Then we must be\r\nperfectly quiet?"\r\n\r\n"As quiet as the grave. And only on the chance!" Ralph added.\r\n\r\n"The chance she may?"\r\n\r\n"The chance she may not?"\r\n\r\nLord Warburton took this at first in silence, but he spoke again. "Is he\r\nawfully clever?"\r\n\r\n"Awfully," said Ralph.\r\n\r\nHis companion thought. "And what else?"\r\n\r\n"What more do you want?" Ralph groaned.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean what more does _she_?"\r\n\r\nRalph took him by the arm to turn him: they had to rejoin the others.\r\n"She wants nothing that _we_ can give her."\r\n\r\n"Ah well, if she won\'t have You--!" said his lordship handsomely as they\r\nwent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Portrait of a Lady, by Henry James\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 2833-8.txt or 2833-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/8/3/2833/\r\n\r\nProduced by Eve Sobol\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
