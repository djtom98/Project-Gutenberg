Yet so simple and\r\nmassive is the topography of the State in general views, that the main\r\ncentral portion displays only one valley, and two chains of mountains\r\nwhich seem almost perfectly regular in trend and height: the Coast\r\nRange on the west side, the Sierra Nevada on the east. These two ranges\r\ncoming together in curves on the north and south inclose a magnificent\r\nbasin, with a level floor more than 400 miles long, and from 35 to 60\r\nmiles wide. This is the grand Central Valley of California, the waters\r\nof which have only one outlet to the sea through the Golden Gate. But\r\nwith this general simplicity of features there is great complexity of\r\nhidden detail. The Coast Range, rising as a grand green barrier against\r\nthe ocean, from 2000 to 8000 feet high, is composed of innumerable\r\nforest-crowned spurs, ridges, and rolling hill-waves which inclose a\r\nmultitude of smaller valleys; some looking out through long,\r\nforest-lined vistas to the sea; others, with but few trees, to the\r\nCentral Valley; while a thousand others yet smaller are embosomed and\r\nconcealed in mild, round-browed hills, each, with its own climate,\r\nsoil, and productions.\r\n\r\nMaking your way through the mazes of the Coast Range to the summit of\r\nany of the inner peaks or passes opposite San Francisco, in the clear\r\nspringtime, the grandest and most telling of all California landscapes\r\nis outspread before you. At your feet lies the great Central Valley\r\nglowing golden in the sunshine, extending north and south farther than\r\nthe eye can reach, one smooth, flowery, lake-like bed of fertile soil.\r\nAlong its eastern margin rises the mighty Sierra, miles in height,\r\nreposing like a smooth, cumulous cloud in the sunny sky, and so\r\ngloriously colored, and so luminous, it seems to be not clothed with\r\nlight, but wholly composed of it, like the wall of some celestial city.\r\nAlong the top, and extending a good way down, you see a pale,\r\npearl-gray belt of snow; and below it a belt of blue and dark purple,\r\nmarking the extension of the forests; and along the base of the range a\r\nbroad belt of rose-purple and yellow, where lie the minor\xe2\x80\x99s gold-fields\r\nand the foot-hill gardens. All these colored belts blending smoothly\r\nmake a wall of light ineffably fine, and as beautiful as a rainbow, yet\r\nfirm as adamant.\r\n\r\nWhen I first enjoyed this superb view, one glowing April day, from the\r\nsummit of the Pacheco Pass, the Central Valley, but little trampled or\r\nplowed as yet, was one furred, rich sheet of golden compositae, and the\r\nluminous wall of the mountains shone in all its glory. Then it seemed\r\nto me the Sierra should be called not the Nevada, or Snowy Range, but\r\nthe Range of Light. And after ten years spent in the heart of it,\r\nrejoicing and wondering, bathing in its glorious floods of light,\r\nseeing the sunbursts of morning among the icy peaks, the noonday\r\nradiance on the trees and rocks and snow, the flush of the alpenglow,\r\nand a thousand dashing waterfalls with their marvelous abundance of\r\nirised spray, it still seems to me above all others the Range of Light,\r\nthe most divinely beautiful of all the mountain-chains I have ever\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThe Sierra is about 500 miles long, 70 miles wide, and from 7000 to\r\nnearly 15,000 feet high. In general views no mark of man is visible on\r\nit, nor anything to suggest the richness of the life it cherishes, or\r\nthe depth and grandeur of its sculpture. None of its magnificent\r\nforest-crowned ridges rises much above the general level to publish its\r\nwealth. No great valley or lake is seen, or river, or group of\r\nwell-marked features of any kind, standing out in distinct pictures.\r\nEven the summit-peaks, so clear and high in the sky, seem comparatively\r\nsmooth and featureless. Nevertheless, glaciers are still at work in the\r\nshadows of the peaks, and thousands of lakes and meadows shine and\r\nbloom beneath them, and the whole range is furrowed with ca\xc3\xb1ons to a\r\ndepth of from 2000 to 5000 feet, in which once flowed majestic\r\nglaciers, and in which now flow and sing a band of beautiful rivers.\r\n\r\nThough of such stupendous depth, these famous ca\xc3\xb1ons are not raw,\r\ngloomy, jagged-walled gorges, savage and inaccessible. With rough\r\npassages here and there they still make delightful pathways for the\r\nmountaineer, conducting from the fertile lowlands to the highest icy\r\nfountains, as a kind of mountain streets full of charming life and\r\nlight, graded and sculptured by the ancient glaciers, and presenting,\r\nthroughout all their courses, a rich variety of novel and attractive\r\nscenery, the most attractive that has yet been discovered in the\r\nmountain-ranges of the world.\r\n\r\nIn many places, especially in the middle region of the western flank of\r\nthe range, the main ca\xc3\xb1ons widen into spacious valleys or parks,\r\ndiversified like artificial landscape-gardens, with charming groves and\r\nmeadows, and thickets of blooming bushes, while the lofty, retiring\r\nwalls, infinitely varied in form and sculpture, are fringed with ferns,\r\nflowering-plants of many species, oaks, and evergreens, which find\r\nanchorage on a thousand narrow steps and benches; while the whole is\r\nenlivened and made glorious with rejoicing streams that come dancing\r\nand foaming over the sunny brows of the cliffs to join the shining\r\nriver that flows in tranquil beauty down the middle of each one of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe walls of these park valleys of the Yosemite kind are made up of\r\nrocks mountains in size, partly separated from each other by narrow\r\ngorges and side-ca\xc3\xb1ons; and they are so sheer in front, and so\r\ncompactly built together on a level floor, that, comprehensively seen,\r\nthe parks they inclose look like immense halls or temples lighted from\r\nabove. Every rock seems to glow with life. Some lean back in majestic\r\nrepose; others, absolutely sheer, or nearly so, for thousands of feet,\r\nadvance their brows in thoughtful attitudes beyond their companions,\r\ngiving welcome to storms and calms alike, seemingly conscious yet\r\nheedless of everything going on about them, awful in stern majesty,\r\ntypes of permanence, yet associated with beauty of the frailest and\r\nmost fleeting forms; their feet set in pine-groves and gay emerald\r\nmeadows, their brows in the sky; bathed in light, bathed in floods of\r\nsinging water, while snow-clouds, avalanches, and the winds shine and\r\nsurge and wreathe about them as the years go by, as if into these\r\nmountain mansions Nature had taken pains to gather her choicest\r\ntreasures to draw her lovers into close and confiding communion with\r\nher.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUNT TAMALPAIS\xe2\x80\x94NORTH OF THE GOLDEN GATE.]\r\n\r\nHere, too, in the middle region of deepest ca\xc3\xb1ons are the grandest\r\nforest-trees, the Sequoia, king of conifers, the noble Sugar and Yellow\r\nPines, Douglas Spruce, Libocedrus, and the Silver Firs, each a giant of\r\nits kind, assembled together in one and the same forest, surpassing all\r\nother coniferous forests in the world, both in the number of its\r\nspecies and in the size and beauty of its trees. The winds flow in\r\nmelody through their colossal spires, and they are vocal everywhere\r\nwith the songs of birds and running water. Miles of fragrant ceanothus\r\nand manzanita bushes bloom beneath them, and lily gardens and meadows,\r\nand damp, ferny glens in endless variety of fragrance and color,\r\ncompelling the admiration of every observer. Sweeping on over ridge and\r\nvalley, these noble trees extend a continuous belt from end to end of\r\nthe range, only slightly interrupted by sheer-walled ca\xc3\xb1ons at\r\nintervals of about fifteen and twenty miles. Here the great burly brown\r\nbears delight to roam, harmonizing with the brown boles of the trees\r\nbeneath which they feed. Deer, also, dwell here, and find food and\r\nshelter in the ceanothus tangles, with a multitude of smaller people.\r\nAbove this region of giants, the trees grow smaller until the utmost\r\nlimit of the timber line is reached on the stormy mountain-slopes at a\r\nheight of from ten to twelve thousand feet above the sea, where the\r\nDwarf Pine is so lowly and hard beset by storms and heavy snow, it is\r\npressed into flat tangles, over the tops of which we may easily walk.\r\nBelow the main forest belt the trees likewise diminish in size, frost\r\nand burning drought repressing and blasting alike.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE SIERRA NEVADA]\r\n\r\nThe rose-purple zone along the base of the range comprehends nearly all\r\nthe famous gold region of California. And here it was that miners from\r\nevery country under the sun assembled in a wild, torrent-like rush to\r\nseek their fortunes. On the banks of every river, ravine, and gully\r\nthey have left their marks. Every gravel- and boulder-bed has been\r\ndesperately riddled over and over again. But in this region the pick\r\nand shovel, once wielded with savage enthusiasm, have been laid away,\r\nand only quartz-mining is now being carried on to any considerable\r\nextent. The zone in general is made up of low, tawny, waving\r\nfoot-hills, roughened here and there with brush and trees, and\r\noutcropping masses of slate, colored gray and red with lichens. The\r\nsmaller masses of slate, rising abruptly from the dry, grassy sod in\r\nleaning slabs, look like ancient tombstones in a deserted\r\nburying-ground. In early spring, say from February to April, the whole\r\nof this foot-hill belt is a paradise of bees and flowers. Refreshing\r\nrains then fall freely, birds are busy building their nests, and the\r\nsunshine is balmy and delightful. But by the end of May the soil,\r\nplants, and sky seem to have been baked in an oven. Most of the plants\r\ncrumble to dust beneath the foot, and the ground is full of cracks;\r\nwhile the thirsty traveler gazes with eager longing through the burning\r\nglare to the snowy summits looming like hazy clouds in the distance.\r\n\r\nThe trees, mostly _Quercus Douglasii_ and _Pinus Sabiniana_, thirty to\r\nforty feet high, with thin, pale-green foliage, stand far apart and\r\ncast but little shade. Lizards glide about on the rocks enjoying a\r\nconstitution that no drought can dry, and ants in amazing numbers,\r\nwhose tiny sparks of life seem to burn the brighter with the increasing\r\nheat, ramble industriously in long trains in search of food. Crows,\r\nravens, magpies\xe2\x80\x94friends in distress\xe2\x80\x94gather on the ground beneath the\r\nbest shade-trees, panting with drooping wings and bills wide open,\r\nscarce a note from any of them during the midday hours. Quails, too,\r\nseek the shade during the heat of the day about tepid pools in the\r\nchannels of the larger mid-river streams. Rabbits scurry from thicket\r\nto thicket among the ceanothus bushes, and occasionally a long-eared\r\nhare is seen cantering gracefully across the wider openings. The nights\r\nare calm and dewless during the summer, and a thousand voices proclaim\r\nthe abundance of life, notwithstanding the desolating effect of dry\r\nsunshine on the plants and larger animals. The hylas make a\r\ndelightfully pure and tranquil music after sunset; and coyotes, the\r\nlittle, despised dogs of the wilderness, brave, hardy fellows, looking\r\nlike withered wisps of hay, bark in chorus for hours. Mining-towns,\r\nmost of them dead, and a few living ones with bright bits of\r\ncultivation about them, occur at long intervals along the belt, and\r\ncottages covered with climbing roses, in the midst of orange and peach\r\norchards, and sweet-scented hay-fields in fertile flats where water for\r\nirrigation may be had. But they are mostly far apart, and make scarce\r\nany mark in general views.\r\n\r\nEvery winter the High Sierra and the middle forest region get snow in\r\nglorious abundance, and even the foot-hills are at times whitened. Then\r\nall the range looks like a vast beveled wall of purest marble. The\r\nrough places are then made smooth, the death and decay of the year is\r\ncovered gently and kindly, and the ground seems as clean as the sky.\r\nAnd though silent in its flight from the clouds, and when it is taking\r\nits place on rock, or tree, or grassy meadow, how soon the gentle snow\r\nfinds a voice! Slipping from the heights, gathering in avalanches, it\r\nbooms and roars like thunder, and makes a glorious show as it sweeps\r\ndown the mountain-side, arrayed in long, silken streamers and\r\nwreathing, swirling films of crystal dust.\r\n\r\nThe north half of the range is mostly covered with floods of lava, and\r\ndotted with volcanoes and craters, some of them recent and perfect in\r\nform, others in various stages of decay. The south half is composed of\r\ngranite nearly from base to summit, while a considerable number of\r\npeaks, in the middle of the range, are capped with metamorphic slates,\r\namong which are Mounts Dana and Gibbs to the east of Yosemite Valley.\r\nMount Whitney, the culminating point of the range near its southern\r\nextremity, lifts its helmet-shaped crest to a height of nearly 14,700\r\nfeet. Mount Shasta, a colossal volcanic cone, rises to a height of\r\n14,440 feet at the northern extremity, and forms a noble landmark for\r\nall the surrounding region within a radius of a hundred miles. Residual\r\nmasses of volcanic rocks occur throughout most of the granitic southern\r\nportion also, and a considerable number of old volcanoes on the flanks,\r\nespecially along the eastern base of the range near Mono Lake and\r\nsouthward. But it is only to the northward that the entire range, from\r\nbase to summit, is covered with lava.\r\n\r\nFrom the summit of Mount Whitney only granite is seen. Innumerable\r\npeaks and spires but little lower than its own storm-beaten crags rise\r\nin groups like forest-trees, in full view, segregated by ca\xc3\xb1ons of\r\ntremendous depth and ruggedness. On Shasta nearly every feature in the\r\nvast view speaks of the old volcanic fires. Far to the northward, in\r\nOregon, the icy volcanoes of Mount Pitt and the Three Sisters rise\r\nabove the dark evergreen woods. Southward innumerable smaller craters\r\nand cones are distributed along the axis of the range and on each\r\nflank. Of these, Lassen\xe2\x80\x99s Butte is the highest, being nearly 11,000\r\nfeet above sea-level. Miles of its flanks are reeking and bubbling with\r\nhot springs, many of them so boisterous and sulphurous they seem over\r\nready to become spouting geysers like those of the Yellowstone.\r\n\r\nThe Cinder Cone near marks the most recent volcanic eruption in the\r\nSierra. It is a symmetrical truncated cone about 700 feet high, covered\r\nwith gray cinders and ashes, and has a regular unchanged crater on its\r\nsummit, in which a few small Two-leaved Pines are growing. These show\r\nthat the age of the cone is not less than eighty years. It stands\r\nbetween two lakes, which a short time ago were one. Before the cone was\r\nbuilt, a flood of rough vesicular lava was poured into the lake,\r\ncutting it in two, and, overflowing its banks, the fiery flood advanced\r\ninto the pine-woods, overwhelming the trees in its way, the charred\r\nends of some of which may still be seen projecting from beneath the\r\nsnout of the lava-stream where it came to rest. Later still there was\r\nan eruption of ashes and loose obsidian cinders, probably from the same\r\nvent, which, besides forming the Cinder Cone, scattered a heavy shower\r\nover the surrounding woods for miles to a depth of from six inches to\r\nseveral feet.\r\n\r\nThe history of this last Sierra eruption is also preserved in the\r\ntraditions of the Pitt River Indians. They tell of a fearful time of\r\ndarkness, when the sky was black with ashes and smoke that threatened\r\nevery living thing with death, and that when at length the sun appeared\r\nonce more it was red like blood.\r\n\r\nLess recent craters in great numbers roughen the adjacent region; some\r\nof them with lakes in their throats, others overgrown with trees and\r\nflowers, Nature in these old hearths and firesides having literally\r\ngiven beauty for ashes. On the northwest side of Mount Shasta there is\r\na subordinate cone about 3000 feet below the summit, which, has been\r\nactive subsequent to the breaking up of the main ice-cap that once\r\ncovered the mountain, as is shown by its comparatively unwasted crater\r\nand the streams of unglaciated lava radiating from it. The main summit\r\nis about a mile and a half in diameter, bounded by small crumbling\r\npeaks and ridges, among which we seek in vain for the outlines of the\r\nancient crater.\r\n\r\nThese ruinous masses, and the deep glacial grooves that flute the sides\r\nof the mountain, show that it has been considerably lowered and wasted\r\nby ice; how much we have no sure means of knowing. Just below the\r\nextreme summit hot sulphurous gases and vapor issue from irregular\r\nfissures, mixed with spray derived from melting snow, the last feeble\r\nexpression of the mighty force that built the mountain. Not in one\r\ngreat convulsion was Shasta given birth. The crags of the summit and\r\nthe sections exposed by the glaciers down the sides display enough of\r\nits internal framework to prove that comparatively long periods of\r\nquiescence intervened between many distinct eruptions, during which the\r\ncooling lavas ceased to flow, and became permanent additions to the\r\nbulk of the growing mountain. With alternate haste and deliberation\r\neruption succeeded eruption till the old volcano surpassed even its\r\npresent sublime height.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUNT SHASTA]\r\n\r\nStanding on the icy top of this, the grandest of all the fire-mountains\r\nof the Sierra, we can hardly fail to look forward to its next eruption.\r\nGardens, vineyards, homes have been planted confidingly on the flanks\r\nof volcanoes which, after remaining steadfast for ages, have suddenly\r\nblazed into violent action, and poured forth overwhelming floods of\r\nfire. It is known that more than a thousand years of cool calm have\r\nintervened between violent eruptions. Like gigantic geysers spouting\r\nmolten rock instead of water, volcanoes work and rest, and we have no\r\nsure means of knowing whether they are dead when still, or only\r\nsleeping.\r\n\r\nAlong the western base of the range a telling series of sedimentary\r\nrocks containing the early history of the Sierra are now being studied.\r\nBut leaving for the present these first chapters, we see that only a\r\nvery short geological time ago, just before the coming on of that\r\nwinter of winters called the glacial period, a vast deluge of molten\r\nrocks poured from many a chasm and crater on the flanks and summit of\r\nthe range, filling lake basins and river channels, and obliterating\r\nnearly every existing feature on the northern portion. At length these\r\nall-destroying floods ceased to flow. But while the great volcanic\r\ncones built up along the axis still burned and smoked, the whole Sierra\r\npassed under the domain of ice and snow. Then over the bald,\r\nfeatureless, fire-blackened mountains, glaciers began to crawl,\r\ncovering them from the summits to the sea with a mantle of ice; and\r\nthen with infinite deliberation the work went on of sculpturing the\r\nrange anew. These mighty agents of erosion, halting never through\r\nunnumbered centuries, crushed and ground the flinty lavas and granites\r\nbeneath their crystal folds, wasting and building until in the fullness\r\nof time the Sierra was born again, brought to light nearly as we behold\r\nit today, with glaciers and snow-crushed pines at the top of the range,\r\nwheat-fields and orange-groves at the foot of it.\r\n\r\nThis change from icy darkness and death to life and beauty was slow, as\r\nwe count time, and is still going on, north and south, over all the\r\nworld wherever glaciers exist, whether in the form of distinct rivers,\r\nas in Switzerland, Norway, the mountains of Asia, and the Pacific\r\nCoast; or in continuous mantling folds, as in portions of Alaska,\r\nGreenland, Franz-Joseph-Land, Nova Zembla, Spitzbergen, and the lands\r\nabout the South Pole. But in no country, as far as I know, may these\r\nmajestic changes be studied to better advantage than in the plains and\r\nmountains of California.\r\n\r\nToward the close of the glacial period, when the snow-clouds became\r\nless fertile and the melting waste of sunshine became greater, the\r\nlower folds of the ice-sheet in California, discharging fleets of\r\nicebergs into the sea, began to shallow and recede from the lowlands,\r\nand then move slowly up the flanks of the Sierra in compliance with the\r\nchanges of climate. The great white mantle on the mountains broke up\r\ninto a series of glaciers more or less distinct and river-like, with\r\nmany tributaries, and these again were melted and divided into still\r\nsmaller glaciers, until now only a few of the smallest residual topmost\r\nbranches of the grand system exist on the cool slopes of the summit\r\npeaks.\r\n\r\nPlants and animals, biding their time, closely followed the retiring\r\nice, bestowing quick and joyous animation on the new-born landscapes.\r\nPine-trees marched up the sun-warmed moraines in long, hopeful files,\r\ntaking the ground and establishing themselves as soon as it was ready\r\nfor them; brown-spiked sedges fringed the shores of the newborn lakes;\r\nyoung rivers roared in the abandoned channels of the glaciers; flowers\r\nbloomed around the feet of the great burnished domes,\xe2\x80\x94while with quick\r\nfertility mellow beds of soil, settling and warming, offered food to\r\nmultitudes of Nature\xe2\x80\x99s waiting children, great and small, animals as\r\nwell as plants; mice, squirrels, marmots, deer, bears, elephants, etc.\r\nThe ground burst into bloom with magical rapidity, and the young\r\nforests into bird-song: life in every form warming and sweetening and\r\ngrowing richer as the years passed away over the mighty Sierra so\r\nlately suggestive of death and consummate desolation only.\r\n\r\nIt is hard without long and loving study to realize the magnitude of\r\nthe work done on these mountains during the last glacial period by\r\nglaciers, which are only streams of closely compacted snow-crystals.\r\nCareful study of the phenomena presented goes to show that the\r\npre-glacial condition of the range was comparatively simple: one vast\r\nwave of stone in which a thousand mountains, domes, ca\xc3\xb1ons, ridges,\r\netc., lay concealed. And in the development of these Nature chose for a\r\ntool not the earthquake or lightning to rend and split asunder, not the\r\nstormy torrent or eroding rain, but the tender snow-flowers noiselessly\r\nfalling through unnumbered centuries, the offspring of the sun and sea.\r\nLaboring harmoniously in united strength they crushed and ground and\r\nwore away the rocks in their march, making vast beds of soil, and at\r\nthe same time developed and fashioned the landscapes into the\r\ndelightful variety of hill and dale and lordly mountain that mortals\r\ncall beauty. Perhaps more than a mile in average depth has the range\r\nbeen thus degraded during the last glacial period,\xe2\x80\x94a quantity of\r\nmechanical work almost inconceivably great. And our admiration must be\r\nexcited again and again as we toil and study and learn that this vast\r\njob of rockwork, so far-reaching in its influences, was done by agents\r\nso fragile and small as are these flowers of the mountain clouds.\r\nStrong only by force of numbers, they carried away entire mountains,\r\nparticle by particle, block by block, and cast them into the sea;\r\nsculptured, fashioned, modeled all the range, and developed its\r\npredestined beauty. All these new Sierra landscapes were evidently\r\npredestined, for the physical structure of the rocks on which the\r\nfeatures of the scenery depend was acquired while they lay at least a\r\nmile deep below the pre-glacial surface. And it was while these\r\nfeatures were taking form in the depths of the range, the particles of\r\nthe rocks marching to their appointed places in the dark with reference\r\nto the coming beauty, that the particles of icy vapor in the sky\r\nmarching to the same music assembled to bring them to the light. Then,\r\nafter their grand task was done, these bands of snow-flowers, these\r\nmighty glaciers, were melted and removed as if of no more importance\r\nthan dew destined to last but an hour. Few, however, of Nature\xe2\x80\x99s agents\r\nhave left monuments so noble and enduring as they. The great granite\r\ndomes a mile high, the ca\xc3\xb1ons as deep, the noble peaks, the Yosemite\r\nvalleys, these, and indeed nearly all other features of the Sierra\r\nscenery, are glacier monuments.\r\n\r\nContemplating the works of these flowers of the sky, one may easily\r\nfancy them endowed with life: messengers sent down to work in the\r\nmountain mines on errands of divine love. Silently flying through the\r\ndarkened air, swirling, glinting, to their appointed places, they seem\r\nto have taken counsel together, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cCome, we are feeble; let us\r\nhelp one another. We are many, and together we will be strong. Marching\r\nin close, deep ranks, let us roll away the stones from these mountain\r\nsepulchers, and set the landscapes free. Let us uncover these\r\nclustering domes. Here let us carve a lake basin; there, a Yosemite\r\nValley; here, a channel for a river with fluted steps and brows for the\r\nplunge of songful cataracts. Yonder let us spread broad sheets of soil,\r\nthat man and beast may be fed; and here pile trains of boulders for\r\npines and giant Sequoias. Here make ground for a meadow; there, for a\r\ngarden and grove, making it smooth and fine for small daisies and\r\nviolets and beds of heathy bryanthus, spicing it well with crystals,\r\ngarnet feldspar, and zircon.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus and so on it has oftentimes seemed\r\nto me sang and planned and labored the hearty snow-flower crusaders;\r\nand nothing that I can write can possibly exaggerate the grandeur and\r\nbeauty of their work. Like morning mist they have vanished in sunshine,\r\nall save the few small companies that still linger on the coolest\r\nmountainsides, and, as residual glaciers, are still busily at work\r\ncompleting the last of the lake basins, the last beds of soil, and the\r\nsculpture of some of the highest peaks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUNT HOOD]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nTHE GLACIERS\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the small residual glaciers mentioned in the preceding chapter, I\r\nhave found sixty-five in that portion of the range lying between\r\nlatitude 36\xc2\xb0 30\xe2\x80\xb2 and 39\xc2\xb0. They occur singly or in small groups on the\r\nnorth sides of the peaks of the High Sierra, sheltered beneath broad\r\nfrosty shadows, in amphitheaters of their own making, where the snow,\r\nshooting down from the surrounding heights in avalanches, is most\r\nabundant. Over two thirds of the entire number lie between latitude 37\xc2\xb0\r\nand 38\xc2\xb0, and form the highest fountains of the San Joaquin, Merced,\r\nTuolumne, and Owen\xe2\x80\x99s rivers.\r\n\r\nThe glaciers of Switzerland, like those of the Sierra, are mere wasting\r\nremnants of mighty ice-floods that once filled the great valleys and\r\npoured into the sea. So, also, are those of Norway, Asia, and South\r\nAmerica. Even the grand continuous mantles of ice that still cover\r\nGreenland, Spitsbergen, Nova Zembla, Franz-Joseph-Land, parts of\r\nAlaska, and the south polar region are shallowing and shrinking. Every\r\nglacier in the world is smaller than it once was. All the world is\r\ngrowing warmer, or the crop of snow-flowers is diminishing. But in\r\ncontemplating the condition of the glaciers of the world, we must bear\r\nin mind while trying to account for the changes going on that the same\r\nsunshine that wastes them builds them. Every glacier records the\r\nexpenditure of an enormous amount of sun-heat in lifting the vapor for\r\nthe snow of which it is made from the ocean to the mountains, as\r\nTyndall strikingly shows.\r\n\r\nThe number of glaciers in the Alps, according to the Schlagintweit\r\nbrothers, is 1100, of which 100 may be regarded as primary, and the\r\ntotal area of ice, snow, and _n\xc3\xa9v\xc3\xa9_ is estimated at 1177 square miles,\r\nor an average for each glacier of little more than one square mile. On\r\nthe same authority, the average height above sea-level at which they\r\nmelt is about 7414 feet. The Grindelwald glacier descends below 4000\r\nfeet, and one of the Mont Blanc glaciers reaches nearly as low a point.\r\nOne of the largest of the Himalaya glaciers on the head waters of the\r\nGanges does not, according to Captain Hodgson, descend below 12,914\r\nfeet. The largest of the Sierra glaciers on Mount Shasta descends to\r\nwithin 9500 feet of the level of the sea, which, as far as I have\r\nobserved, is the lowest point reached by any glacier within the bounds\r\nof California, the average height of all being not far from 11,000\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe changes that have taken place in the glacial conditions of the\r\nSierra from the time of greatest extension is well illustrated by the\r\nseries of glaciers of every size and form extending along the mountains\r\nof the coast to Alaska. A general exploration of this instructive\r\nregion shows that to the north of California, through Oregon and\r\nWashington, groups of active glaciers still exist on all the high\r\nvolcanic cones of the Cascade Range,\xe2\x80\x94Mount Pitt, the Three Sisters,\r\nMounts Jefferson, Hood, St. Helens, Adams, Rainier, Baker, and\r\nothers,\xe2\x80\x94some of them of considerable size, though none of them approach\r\nthe sea. Of these mountains Rainier, in Washington, is the highest and\r\niciest. Its dome-like summit, between 14,000 and 15,000 feet high, is\r\ncapped with ice, and eight glaciers, seven to twelve miles long,\r\nradiate from it as a center, and form the sources of the principal\r\nstreams of the State. The lowest-descending of this fine group flows\r\nthrough beautiful forests to within 3500 feet of the sea-level, and\r\nsends forth a river laden with glacier mud and sand. On through British\r\nColumbia and southeastern Alaska the broad, sustained mountain-chain,\r\nextending along the coast, is generally glacier-bearing. The upper\r\nbranches of nearly all the main ca\xc3\xb1ons and fiords are occupied by\r\nglaciers, which gradually increase in size, and descend lower until the\r\nhigh region between Mount Fairweather and Mount St. Elias is reached,\r\nwhere a considerable number discharge into the waters of the ocean.\r\nThis is pre\xc3\xabminently the ice-land of Alaska and of the entire Pacific\r\nCoast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE GLACIER COUNTRY]\r\n\r\nNorthward from here the glaciers gradually diminish in size and\r\nthickness, and melt at higher levels. In Prince William Sound and\r\nCook\xe2\x80\x99s Inlet many fine glaciers are displayed, pouring from the\r\nsurrounding mountains; but to the north of latitude 62\xc2\xb0 few, if any,\r\nglaciers remain, the ground being mostly low and the snowfall light.\r\nBetween latitude 56\xc2\xb0 and 60\xc2\xb0 there are probably more than 5000\r\nglaciers, not counting the smallest. Hundreds of the largest size\r\ndescend through the forests to the level of the sea, or near it, though\r\nas far as my own observations have reached, after a pretty thorough\r\nexamination of the region, not more than twenty-five discharge icebergs\r\ninto the sea. All the long high-walled fiords into which these great\r\nglaciers of the first class flow are of course crowded with icebergs of\r\nevery conceivable form, which are detached with thundering noise at\r\nintervals of a few minutes from an imposing ice-wall that is thrust\r\nforward into deep water. But these Pacific Coast icebergs are small as\r\ncompared with those of Greenland and the Antarctic region, and only a\r\nfew of them escape from the intricate system of channels, with which\r\nthis portion of the coast is fringed, into the open sea. Nearly all of\r\nthem are swashed and drifted by wind and tide back and forth in the\r\nfiords until finally melted by the ocean water, the sunshine, the warm\r\nwinds, and the copious rains of summer. Only one glacier on the coast,\r\nobserved by Prof. Russell, discharges its bergs directly into the open\r\nsea, at Icy Cape, opposite Mount St. Elias. The southernmost of the\r\nglaciers that reach the sea occupies a narrow, picturesque fiord about\r\ntwenty miles to the northwest of the mouth of the Stikeen River, in\r\nlatitude 56\xc2\xb0 50\xe2\x80\xb2. The fiord is called by the natives \xe2\x80\x9cHutli,\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\nThunder Bay, from the noise made by the discharge of the icebergs.\r\nAbout one degree farther north there are four of these complete\r\nglaciers, discharging at the heads of the long arms of Holkam Bay. At\r\nthe head of the Tahkoo Inlet, still farther north, there is one; and at\r\nthe head and around the sides of Glacier Bay, trending in a general\r\nnortherly direction from Cross Sound in latitude 58\xc2\xb0 to 59\xc2\xb0, there are\r\nseven of these complete glaciers pouring bergs into the bay and its\r\nbranches, and keeping up an eternal thundering. The largest of this\r\ngroup, the Muir, has upward of 200 tributaries, and a width below the\r\nconfluence of the main tributaries of about twenty-five miles. Between\r\nthe west side of this icy bay and the ocean all the ground, high and\r\nlow, excepting the peaks of the Fairweather Range, is covered with a\r\nmantle of ice from 1000 to probably 3000 feet thick, which discharges\r\nby many distinct mouths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUNT RAINIER; NORTH PUYALLUP GLACIER FROM EAGLE CLIFF]\r\n\r\nThis fragmentary ice-sheet, and the immense glaciers about Mount St.\r\nElias, together with the multitude of separate river-like glaciers that\r\nload the slopes of the coast mountains, evidently once formed part of a\r\ncontinuous ice-sheet that flowed over all the region hereabouts, and\r\nonly a comparatively short time ago extended as far southward as the\r\nmouth of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, probably farther. All the islands\r\nof the Alexander Archipelago, as well as the headlands and promontories\r\nof the mainland, display telling traces of this great mantle that are\r\nstill fresh and unmistakable. They all have the forms of the greatest\r\nstrength with reference to the action of a vast rigid press of\r\noversweeping ice from the north and northwest, and their surfaces have\r\na smooth, rounded, overrubbed appearance, generally free from angles.\r\nThe intricate labyrinth of canals, channels, straits, passages, sounds,\r\nnarrows, etc. between the islands, and extending into the mainland, of\r\ncourse manifest in their forms and trends and general characteristics\r\nthe same subordination to the grinding action of universal glaciation\r\nas to their origin, and differ from the islands and banks of the fiords\r\nonly in being portions of the pre-glacial margin of the continent more\r\ndeeply eroded, and therefore covered by the ocean waters which flowed\r\ninto them as the ice was melted out of them. The formation and\r\nextension of fiords in this manner is still going on, and may be\r\nwitnessed in many places in Glacier Bay, Yakutat Bay, and adjacent\r\nregions. That the domain of the sea is being extended over the land by\r\nthe wearing away of its shores, is well known, but in these icy regions\r\nof Alaska, and even as far south as Vancouver Island, the coast rocks\r\nhave been so short a time exposed to wave-action they are but little\r\nwasted as yet. In these regions the extension of the sea effected by\r\nits own action in post-glacial time is scarcely appreciable as compared\r\nwith that effected by ice-action.\r\n\r\nTraces of the vanished glaciers made during the period of greater\r\nextension abound on the Sierra as far south as latitude 36\xc2\xb0. Even the\r\npolished rock surfaces, the most evanescent of glacial records, are\r\nstill found in a wonderfully perfect state of preservation on the upper\r\nhalf of the middle portion of the range, and form the most striking of\r\nall the glacial phenomena. They occur in large irregular patches in the\r\nsummit and middle regions, and though they have been subjected to the\r\naction of the weather with its corroding storms for thousands of years,\r\ntheir mechanical excellence is such that they still reflect the\r\nsunbeams like glass, and attract the attention of every observer. The\r\nattention of the mountaineer is seldom arrested by moraines, however\r\nregular and high they may be, or by ca\xc3\xb1ons, however deep, or by rocks,\r\nhowever noble in form and sculpture; but he stoops and rubs his hands\r\nadmiringly on the shining surfaces and trios hard to account for their\r\nmysterious smoothness. He has seen the snow descending in avalanches,\r\nbut concludes this cannot be the work of snow, for he finds it where no\r\navalanches occur. Nor can water have done it, for he sees this\r\nsmoothness glowing on the sides and tops of the highest domes. Only the\r\nwinds of all the agents he knows seem capable of flowing in the\r\ndirections indicated by the scoring. Indians, usually so little curious\r\nabout geological phenomena, have come to me occasionally and asked me,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makeum the ground so smooth at Lake Tenaya?\xe2\x80\x9d Even horses and dogs\r\ngaze wonderingly at the strange brightness of the ground, and smell the\r\npolished spaces and place their feet cautiously on them when they come\r\nto them for the first time, as if afraid of sinking. The most perfect\r\nof the polished pavements and walls lie at an elevation of from 7000 to\r\n9000 feet above the sea, where the rock is compact silicious granite.\r\nSmall dim patches may be found as low as 3000 feet on the driest and\r\nmost enduring portions of sheer walls with a southern exposure, and on\r\ncompact swelling bosses partially protected from rain by a covering of\r\nlarge boulders. On the north half of the range the striated and\r\npolished surfaces are less common, not only because this part of the\r\nchain is lower, but because the surface rocks are chiefly porous lavas\r\nsubject to comparatively rapid waste. The ancient moraines also, though\r\nwell preserved on most of the south half of the range, are nearly\r\nobliterated to the northward, but then material is found scattered and\r\ndisintegrated.\r\n\r\nA similar blurred condition of the superficial records of glacial\r\naction obtains throughout most of Oregon, Washington, British Columbia,\r\nand Alaska, due in great part to the action of excessive moisture. Even\r\nin southeastern Alaska, where the most extensive glaciers on the\r\ncontinent are, the more evanescent of the traces of their former\r\ngreater extension, though comparatively recent, are more obscure than\r\nthose of the ancient California glaciers whore the climate is drier and\r\nthe rocks more resisting.\r\n\r\nThese general views of the glaciers of the Pacific Coast will enable my\r\nreaders to see something of the changes that have taken place in\r\nCalifornia, and will throw light on the residual glaciers of the High\r\nSierra.\r\n\r\nPrior to the autumn of 1871 the glaciers of the Sierra were unknown. In\r\nOctober of that year I discovered the Black Mountain Glacier in a\r\nshadowy amphitheater between Black and Rod Mountains, two of the peaks\r\nof the Merced group. This group is the highest portion of a spur that\r\nstraggles out from the main axis of the range in the direction of\r\nYosemite Valley. At the time of this interesting discovery I was\r\nexploring the _n\xc3\xa9v\xc3\xa9_ amphitheaters of the group, and tracing the\r\ncourses of the ancient glaciers that once poured from its ample\r\nfountains through the Illilouette Basin and the Yosemite Valley, not\r\nexpecting to find any active glaciers so far south in the land of\r\nsunshine.\r\n\r\nBeginning on the northwestern extremity of the group, I explored the\r\nchief tributary basins in succession, their moraines, roches\r\nmoutonn\xc3\xa9es, and splendid glacier pavements, taking them in regular\r\nsuccession without any reference to the time consumed in their study.\r\nThe monuments of the tributary that poured its ice from between Red and\r\nBlack Mountains I found to be the most interesting of them all; and\r\nwhen I saw its magnificent moraines extending in majestic curves from\r\nthe spacious amphitheater between the mountains, I was exhilarated with\r\nthe work that lay before me. It was one of the golden days of the\r\nSierra Indian summer, when the rich sunshine glorifies every landscape\r\nhowever rocky and cold, and suggests anything rather than glaciers. The\r\npath of the vanished glacier was warm now, and shone in many places as\r\nif washed with silver. The tall pines growing on the moraines stood\r\ntransfigured in the glowing light, the poplar groves on the levels of\r\nthe basin were masses of orange-yellow, and the late-blooming\r\ngoldenrods added gold to gold. Pushing on over my rosy glacial highway,\r\nI passed lake after lake set in solid basins of granite, and many a\r\nthicket and meadow watered by a stream that issues from the\r\namphitheater and links the lakes together; now wading through plushy\r\nbogs knee-deep in yellow and purple sphagnum; now passing over bare\r\nrock. The main lateral moraines that bounded the view on either hand\r\nare from 100 to nearly 200 feet high, and about as regular as\r\nartificial embankments, and covered with a superb growth of Silver Fir\r\nand Pine. But this garden and forest luxuriance was speedily left\r\nbehind. The trees were dwarfed as I ascended; patches of the alpine\r\nbryanthus and cassiope began to appear, and arctic willows pressed into\r\nflat carpets by the winter snow. The lakelets, which a few miles down\r\nthe valley were so richly embroidered with flowery meadows, had here,\r\nat an elevation of 10,000 feet, only small brown mats of carex, leaving\r\nbare rocks around more than half their shores. Yet amid this alpine\r\nsuppression the Mountain Pine bravely tossed his storm-beaten branches\r\non the ledges and buttresses of Red Mountain, some specimens being over\r\n100 feet high, and 24 feet in circumference, seemingly as fresh and\r\nvigorous as the giants of the lower zones.\r\n\r\nEvening came on just as I got fairly within the portal of the main\r\namphitheater. It is about a mile wide, and a little less than two miles\r\nlong. The crumbling spurs and battlements of Red Mountain bound it on\r\nthe north, the somber, rudely sculptured precipices of Black Mountain\r\non the south, and a hacked, splintery _col_, curving around from\r\nmountain to mountain, shuts it in on the east.\r\n\r\nI chose a camping-ground on the brink of one of the lakes where a\r\nthicket of Hemlock Spruce sheltered me from the night wind. Then, after\r\nmaking a tin-cupful of tea, I sat by my camp-fire reflecting on the\r\ngrandeur and significance of the glacial records I had seen. As the\r\nnight advanced the mighty rock walls of my mountain mansion seemed to\r\ncome nearer, while the starry sky in glorious brightness stretched\r\nacross like a ceiling from wall to wall, and fitted closely down into\r\nall the spiky irregularities of the summits. Then, after a long\r\nfireside rest and a glance at my note-book, I cut a few leafy branches\r\nfor a bed, and fell into the clear, death-like sleep of the tired\r\nmountaineer.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning I set out to trace the grand old glacier that had\r\ndone so much for the beauty of the Yosemite region back to its farthest\r\nfountains, enjoying the charm that every explorer feels in Nature\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nuntrodden wildernesses. The voices of the mountains were still asleep.\r\nThe wind scarce stirred the pine-needles. The sun was up, but it was\r\nyet too cold for the birds and the few burrowing animals that dwell\r\nhere. Only the stream, cascading from pool to pool, seemed to be wholly\r\nawake. Yet the spirit of the opening day called to action. The sunbeams\r\ncame streaming gloriously through the jagged openings of the _col_,\r\nglancing on the burnished pavements and lighting the silvery lakes,\r\nwhile every sun-touched rock burned white on its edges like melting\r\niron in a furnace. Passing round the north shore of my camp lake I\r\nfollowed the central stream past many cascades from lakelet to lakelet.\r\nThe scenery became more rigidly arctic, the Dwarf Pines and Hemlocks\r\ndisappeared, and the stream was bordered with icicles. As the sun rose\r\nhigher rocks were loosened on shattered portions of the cliffs, and\r\ncame down in rattling avalanches, echoing wildly from crag to crag.\r\n\r\nThe main lateral moraines that extend from the jaws of the amphitheater\r\ninto the Illilouette Basin are continued in straggling masses along the\r\nwalls of the amphitheater, while separate boulders, hundreds of tons in\r\nweight, are left stranded here and there out in the middle of the\r\nchannel. Here, also, I observed a series of small terminal moraines\r\nranged along the south wall of the amphitheater, corresponding in size\r\nand form with the shadows cast by the highest portions. The meaning of\r\nthis correspondence between moraines and shadows was afterward made\r\nplain. Tracing the stream back to the last of its chain of lakelets, I\r\nnoticed a deposit of fine gray mud on the bottom except where the force\r\nof the entering current had prevented its settling. It looked like the\r\nmud worn from a grindstone, and I at once suspected its glacial origin,\r\nfor the stream that was carrying it came gurgling out of the base of a\r\nraw moraine that seemed in process of formation. Not a plant or\r\nweather-stain was visible on its rough, unsettled surface. It is from\r\n60 to over 100 feet high, and plunges forward at an angle of 38\xc2\xb0.\r\nCautiously picking my way, I gained the top of the moraine and was\r\ndelighted to see a small but well characterized glacier swooping down\r\nfrom the gloomy precipices of Black Mountain in a finely graduated\r\ncurve to the moraine on which I stood. The compact ice appeared on all\r\nthe lower portions of the glacier, though gray with dirt and stones\r\nembedded in it. Farther up the ice disappeared beneath coarse\r\ngranulated snow. The surface of the glacier was further characterized\r\nby dirt bands and the outcropping edges of the blue veins, showing the\r\nlaminated structure of the ice. The uppermost crevasse, or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbergschrund,\xe2\x80\x9d where the _n\xc3\xa9v\xc3\xa9_ was attached to the mountain, was from\r\n12 to 14 feet wide, and was bridged in a few places by the remains of\r\nsnow avalanches. Creeping along the edge of the schrund, holding on\r\nwith benumbed fingers, I discovered clear sections where the bedded\r\nstructure was beautifully revealed. The surface snow, though sprinkled\r\nwith stones shot down from the cliffs, was in some places almost pure,\r\ngradually becoming crystalline and changing to whitish porous ice of\r\ndifferent shades of color, and this again changing at a depth of 20 or\r\n30 feet to blue ice, some of the ribbon-like bands of which were nearly\r\npure, and blended with the paler bands in the most gradual and delicate\r\nmanner imaginable. A series of rugged zigzags enabled me to make my way\r\ndown into the weird under-world of the crevasse. Its chambered hollows\r\nwere hung with a multitude of clustered icicles, amid which pale,\r\nsubdued light pulsed and shimmered with indescribable loveliness. Water\r\ndripped and tinkled overhead, and from far below came strange, solemn\r\nmurmurings from currents that were feeling their way through veins and\r\nfissures in the dark. The chambers of a glacier are perfectly\r\nenchanting, notwithstanding one feels out of place in their frosty\r\nbeauty. I was soon cold in my shirt-sleeves, and the leaning wall\r\nthreatened to engulf me; yet it was hard to leave the delicious music\r\nof the water and the lovely light. Coming again to the surface, I\r\nnoticed boulders of every size on their journeys to the terminal\r\nmoraine\xe2\x80\x94journeys of more than a hundred years, without a single stop,\r\nnight or day, winter or summer.\r\n\r\nThe sun gave birth to a network of sweet-voiced rills that ran\r\ngracefully down the glacier, curling and swirling in their shining\r\nchannels, and cutting clear sections through the porous surface-ice\r\ninto the solid blue, where the structure of the glacier was beautifully\r\nillustrated.\r\n\r\nThe series of small terminal moraines which I had observed in the\r\nmorning, along the south wall of the amphitheater, correspond in every\r\nway with the moraine of this glacier, and their distribution with\r\nreference to shadows was now understood. When the climatic changes came\r\non that caused the melting and retreat of the main glacier that filled\r\nthe amphitheater, a series of residual glaciers were left in the cliff\r\nshadows, under the protection of which they lingered, until they formed\r\nthe moraines we are studying. Then, as the snow became still less\r\nabundant, all of them vanished in succession, except the one just\r\ndescribed; and the cause of its longer life is sufficiently apparent in\r\nthe greater area of snow-basin it drains, and its more perfect\r\nprotection from wasting sunshine. How much longer this little glacier\r\nwill last depends, of course, on the amount of snow it receives from\r\nyear to year, as compared with melting waste.\r\n\r\nAfter this discovery, I made excursions over all the High Sierra,\r\npushing my explorations summer after summer, and discovered that what\r\nat first sight in the distance looked like extensive snow-fields, wore\r\nin great part glaciers, busily at work completing the sculpture of the\r\nsummit-peaks so grandly blocked out by their giant predecessors.\r\n\r\nOn August 21, I set a series of stakes in the Maclure Glacier, near\r\nMount Lyell, and found its rate of motion to be little more than an\r\ninch a day in the middle, showing a great contrast to the Muir Glacier\r\nin Alaska, which, near the front, flows at a rate of from five to ten\r\nfeet in twenty-four hours. Mount Shasta has three glaciers, but Mount\r\nWhitney, although it is the highest mountain in the range, does not now\r\ncherish a single glacier. Small patches of lasting snow and ice occur\r\non its northern slopes, but they are shallow, and present no well\r\nmarked evidence of glacial motion. Its sides, however, are scored and\r\npolished in many places by the action of its ancient glaciers that\r\nflowed east and west as tributaries of the great glaciers that once\r\nfilled the valleys of the Kern and Owen\xe2\x80\x99s rivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nTHE SNOW\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first snow that whitens the Sierra, usually falls about the end of\r\nOctober or early in November, to a depth of a few inches, after months\r\nof the most charming Indian summer weather imaginable. But in a few\r\ndays, this light covering mostly melts from the slopes exposed to the\r\nsun and causes but little apprehension on the part of mountaineers who\r\nmay be lingering among the high peaks at this time. The first general\r\nwinter storm that yields snow that is to form a lasting portion of the\r\nseason\xe2\x80\x99s supply, seldom breaks on the mountains before the end of\r\nNovember. Then, warned by the sky, cautions mountaineers, together with\r\nthe wild sheep, deer, and most of the birds and bears, make haste to\r\nthe lowlands or foot-hills; and burrowing marmots, mountain beavers,\r\nwood-rats, and such people go into winter quarters, some of them not\r\nagain to see the light of day until the general awakening and\r\nresurrection of the spring in June or July. The first heavy fall is\r\nusually from about two to four feet in depth. Then, with intervals of\r\nsplendid sunshine, storm succeeds storm, heaping snow on snow, until\r\nthirty to fifty feet has fallen. But on account of its settling and\r\ncompacting, and the almost constant waste from melting and evaporation,\r\nthe average depth actually found at any time seldom exceeds ten feet in\r\nthe forest region, or fifteen feet along the slopes of the summit\r\npeaks.\r\n\r\nEven during the coldest weather evaporation never wholly ceases, and\r\nthe sunshine that abounds between the storms is sufficiently powerful\r\nto melt the surface more or less through all the winter months. Waste\r\nfrom melting also goes on to some extent on the bottom from heat stored\r\nup in the rocks, and given off slowly to the snow in contact with them,\r\nas is shown by the rising of the streams on all the higher regions\r\nafter the first snowfall, and their steady sustained flow all winter.\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of the snow deposited around the lofty summits of\r\nthe range falls in small crisp flakes and broken crystals, or, when\r\naccompanied by strong winds and low temperature, the crystals, instead\r\nof being locked together in their fall to form tufted flakes, are\r\nbeaten and broken into meal and fine dust. But down in the forest\r\nregion the greater portion comes gently to the ground, light and\r\nfeathery, some of the flakes in mild weather being nearly an inch in\r\ndiameter, and it is evenly distributed and kept from drifting to any\r\ngreat extent by the shelter afforded by the large trees. Every tree\r\nduring the progress of gentle storms is loaded with, fairy bloom at the\r\ncoldest and darkest time of year, bending the branches, and hushing\r\nevery singing needle. But as soon as the storm is over, and the sun\r\nshines, the snow at once begins to shift and settle and fall from the\r\nbranches in miniature avalanches, and the white forest soon becomes\r\ngreen again. The snow on the ground also settles and thaws every bright\r\nday, and freezes at night, until it becomes coarsely granulated, and\r\nloses every trace of its rayed crystalline structure, and then a man\r\nmay walk firmly over its frozen surface as if on ice. The forest region\r\nup to an elevation of 7000 feet is usually in great part free from snow\r\nin June, but at this time the higher regions are still heavy-laden, and\r\nare not touched by spring weather to any considerable extent before the\r\nmiddle or end of July.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking effects of the snow on the mountains is the\r\nburial of the rivers and small lakes.\r\n\r\nAs the snow fa\xe2\x80\x99s in the river\r\nA moment white, then lost forever,\r\n\r\n\r\nsang Burns, in illustrating the fleeting character of human pleasure.\r\nThe first snowflakes that fall into the Sierra rivers vanish thus\r\nsuddenly; but in great storms, when the temperature is low, the\r\nabundance of the snow at length chills the water nearly to the\r\nfreezing-point, and then, of course, it ceases to melt and consume the\r\nsnow so suddenly. The falling flakes and crystals form, cloud-like\r\nmasses of blue sludge, which are swept forward with the current and\r\ncarried down to warmer climates many miles distant, while some are\r\nlodged against logs and rocks and projecting points of the banks, and\r\nlast for days, piled high above the level of the water, and show white\r\nagain, instead of being at once \xe2\x80\x9clost forever,\xe2\x80\x9d while the rivers\r\nthemselves are at length lost for months during the snowy period. The\r\nsnow is first built out from the banks in bossy, over-curling drifts,\r\ncompacting and cementing until the streams are spanned. They then flow\r\nin the dark beneath a continuous covering across the snowy zone, which\r\nis about thirty miles wide. All the Sierra rivers and their tributaries\r\nin these high regions are thus lost every winter, as if another glacial\r\nperiod had come on. Not a drop of running water is to be seen excepting\r\nat a few points where large falls occur, though the rush and rumble of\r\nthe heavier currents may still be heard. Toward spring, when the\r\nweather is warm during the day and frosty at night, repeated thawing\r\nand freezing and new layers of snow render the bridging-masses dense\r\nand firm, so that one may safely walk across the streams, or even lead\r\na horse across them without danger of falling through. In June the\r\nthinnest parts of the winter ceiling, and those most exposed to\r\nsunshine, begin to give way, forming dark, rugged-edged, pit-like\r\nsinks, at the bottom of which the rushing water may be seen. At the end\r\nof June only here and there may the mountaineer find a secure\r\nsnow-bridge. The most lasting of the winter bridges, thawing from below\r\nas well as from above, because of warm currents of air passing through\r\nthe tunnels, are strikingly arched and sculptured; and by the\r\noccasional freezing of the oozing, dripping water of the ceiling they\r\nbecome brightly and picturesquely icy. In some of the reaches, where\r\nthere is a free margin, we may walk through them. Small skylights\r\nappearing here and there, these tunnels are not very dark. The roaring\r\nriver fills all the arching way with impressively loud reverberating\r\nmusic, which is sweetened at times by the ouzel, a bird that is not\r\nafraid to go wherever a stream may go, and to sing wherever a stream\r\nsings.\r\n\r\nAll the small alpine pools and lakelets are in like manner obliterated\r\nfrom the winter landscapes, either by being first frozen and then\r\ncovered by snow, or by being filled in by avalanches. The first\r\navalanche of the season shot into a lake basin may perhaps find the\r\nsurface frozen. Then there is a grand crashing of breaking ice and\r\ndashing of waves mingled with the low, deep booming of the avalanche.\r\nDetached masses of the invading snow, mixed with fragments of ice,\r\ndrift about in sludgy, island-like heaps, while the main body of it\r\nforms a talus with its base wholly or in part resting on the bottom of\r\nthe basin, as controlled by its depth and the size of the avalanche.\r\nThe next avalanche, of course, encroaches still farther, and so on with\r\neach in succession until the entire basin may be filled and its water\r\nsponged up or displaced. This huge mass of sludge, more or less mixed\r\nwith sand, stones, and perhaps timber, is frozen to a considerable\r\ndepth, and much sun-heat is required to thaw it. Some of these\r\nunfortunate lakelets are not clear of ice and snow until near the end\r\nof summer. Others are never quite free, opening only on the side\r\nopposite the entrance of the avalanches. Some show only a narrow\r\ncrescent of water lying between the shore and sheer bluffs of icy\r\ncompacted snow, masses of which breaking off float in front like\r\nicebergs in a miniature Arctic Ocean, while the avalanche heaps leaning\r\nback against the mountains look like small glaciers. The frontal cliffs\r\nare in some instances quite picturesque, and with the berg-dotted\r\nwaters in front of them lighted with sunshine are exceedingly\r\nbeautiful. It often happens that while one side of a lake basin is\r\nhopelessly snow-buried and frozen, the other, enjoying sunshine, is\r\nadorned with beautiful flower-gardens. Some of the smaller lakes are\r\nextinguished in an instant by a heavy avalanche either of rocks or\r\nsnow. The rolling, sliding, ponderous mass entering on one side sweeps\r\nacross the bottom and up the opposite side, displacing the water and\r\neven scraping the basin clean, and shoving the accumulated rocks and\r\nsediments up the farther bank and taking full possession. The dislodged\r\nwater is in part absorbed, but most of it is sent around the front of\r\nthe avalanche and down the channel of the outlet, roaring and hurrying\r\nas if frightened and glad to escape.\r\n\r\nSNOW-BANNERS\r\n\r\nThe most magnificent storm phenomenon I ever saw, surpassing in showy\r\ngrandeur the most imposing effects of clouds, floods, or avalanches,\r\nwas the peaks of the High Sierra, back of Yosemite Valley, decorated\r\nwith snow-banners. Many of the starry snow-flowers, out of which these\r\nbanners are made, fall before they are ripe, while most of those that\r\ndo attain perfect development as six-rayed crystals glint and chafe\r\nagainst one another in their fall through the frosty air, and are\r\nbroken into fragments. This dry fragmentary snow is still further\r\nprepared for the formation of banners by the action of the wind. For,\r\ninstead of finding rest at once, like the snow which falls into the\r\ntranquil depths of the forests, it is rolled over and over, beaten\r\nagainst rock-ridges, and swirled in pits and hollows, like boulders,\r\npebbles, and sand in the pot-holes of a river, until finally the\r\ndelicate angles of the crystals are worn off, and the whole mass is\r\nreduced to dust. And whenever storm-winds find this prepared snow-dust\r\nin a loose condition on exposed slopes, where there is a free upward\r\nsweep to leeward, it is tossed back into the sky, and borne onward from\r\npeak to peak in the form of banners or cloudy drifts, according to the\r\nvelocity of the wind and the conformation of the slopes up or around\r\nwhich it is driven. While thus flying through the air, a small portion\r\nmakes good its escape, and remains in the sky as vapor. But far the\r\ngreater part, after being driven into the sky again and again, is at\r\nlength locked fast in bossy drifts, or in the wombs of glaciers, some\r\nof it to remain silent and rigid for centuries before it is finally\r\nmelted and sent singing down the mountainsides to the sea.\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding the abundance of winter snow-dust in the\r\nmountains, and the frequency of high winds, and the length of time the\r\ndust remains loose and exposed to their action, the occurrence of\r\nwell-formed banners is, for causes we shall hereafter note,\r\ncomparatively rare. I have seen only one display of this kind that\r\nseemed in every way perfect. This was in the winter of 1873, when the\r\nsnow-laden summits were swept by a wild \xe2\x80\x9cnorther.\xe2\x80\x9d I happened at the\r\ntime to be wintering in Yosemite Valley, that sublime Sierra temple\r\nwhere every day one may see the grandest sights. Yet even here the wild\r\ngala-day of the north wind seemed surpassingly glorious. I was awakened\r\nin the morning by the rocking of my cabin and the beating of pine-burs\r\non the roof. Detached torrents and avalanches from the main wind-flood\r\noverhead were rushing wildly down the narrow side ca\xc3\xb1ons, and over the\r\nprecipitous walls, with loud resounding roar, rousing the pines to\r\nenthusiastic action, and making the whole valley vibrate as though it\r\nwere an instrument being played.\r\n\r\nBut afar on the lofty exposed peaks of the range standing so high in\r\nthe sky, the storm was expressing itself in still grander characters,\r\nwhich I was soon to see in all their glory. I had long been anxious to\r\nstudy some points in the structure of the ice-cone that is formed every\r\nwinter at the foot of the upper Yosemite fall, but the blinding spray\r\nby which it is invested had hitherto prevented me from making a\r\nsufficiently near approach. This morning the entire body of the fall\r\nwas torn into gauzy shreds, and blown horizontally along the face of\r\nthe cliff, leaving the cone dry; and while making my way to the top of\r\nan overlooking ledge to seize so favorable an opportunity to examine\r\nthe interior of the cone, the peaks of the Merced group came in sight\r\nover the shoulder of the South Dome, each waving a resplendent banner\r\nagainst the blue sky, as regular in form, and as firm in texture, as if\r\nwoven of fine silk. So rare and splendid a phenomenon, of course,\r\noverbore all other considerations, and I at once let the ice-cone go,\r\nand began to force my way out of the valley to some dome or ridge\r\nsufficiently lofty to command a general view of the main summits,\r\nfeeling assured that I should find them bannered still more gloriously;\r\nnor was I in the least disappointed. Indian Ca\xc3\xb1on, through which I\r\nclimbed, was choked with snow that had been shot down in avalanches\r\nfrom the high cliffs on either side, rendering the ascent difficult;\r\nbut inspired by the roaring storm, the tedious wallowing brought no\r\nfatigue, and in four hours I gained the top of a ridge above the\r\nvalley, 8000 feet high. And there in bold relief, like a clear\r\npainting, appeared a most imposing scene. Innumerable peaks, black and\r\nsharp, rose grandly into the dark blue sky, their bases set in solid\r\nwhite, their sides streaked and splashed with snow, like ocean rocks\r\nwith foam; and from every summit, all free and unconfused, was\r\nstreaming a beautiful silky silvery banner, from half a mile to a mile\r\nin length, slender at the point of attachment, then widening gradually\r\nas it extended from the peak until it was about 1000 or 1500 feet in\r\nbreadth, as near as I could estimate. The cluster of peaks called the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrown of the Sierra,\xe2\x80\x9d at the head of the Merced and Tuolumne\r\nrivers,\xe2\x80\x94Mounts Dana, Gibbs, Conness, Lyell, Maclure, Ritter, with their\r\nnameless compeers,\xe2\x80\x94each had its own refulgent banner, waving with a\r\nclearly visible motion in the sunglow, and there was not a single cloud\r\nin the sky to mar their simple grandeur. Fancy yourself standing on\r\nthis Yosemite ridge looking eastward. You notice a strange garish\r\nglitter in the air. The gale drives wildly overhead with a fierce,\r\ntempestuous roar, but its violence is not felt, for you are looking\r\nthrough a sheltered opening in the woods as through a window. There, in\r\nthe immediate foreground of your picture, rises a majestic forest of\r\nSilver Fir blooming in eternal freshness, the foliage yellow-green, and\r\nthe snow beneath the trees strewn with their beautiful plumes, plucked\r\noff by the wind. Beyond, and extending over all the middle ground, are\r\nsomber swaths of pine, interrupted by huge swelling ridges and domes;\r\nand just beyond the dark forest you see the monarchs of the High Sierra\r\nwaving their magnificent banners. They are twenty miles away, but you\r\nwould not wish them nearer, for every feature is distinct, and the\r\nwhole glorious show is seen in its right proportions. After this\r\ngeneral view, mark how sharply the dark snowless ribs and buttresses\r\nand summits of the peaks are defined, excepting the portions veiled by\r\nthe banners, and how delicately their sides are streaked with snow,\r\nwhere it has come to rest in narrow flutings and gorges. Mark, too, how\r\ngrandly the banners wave as the wind is deflected against their sides,\r\nand how trimly each is attached to the very summit of its peak, like a\r\nstreamer at a masthead; how smooth and silky they are in texture, and\r\nhow finely their fading fringes are penciled on the azure sky. See how\r\ndense and opaque they are at the point of attachment, and how filmy and\r\ntranslucent toward the end, so that the peaks back of them are seen\r\ndimly, as though you were looking through ground glass. Yet again\r\nobserve how some of the longest, belonging to the loftiest summits,\r\nstream perfectly free all the way across intervening notches and passes\r\nfrom peak to peak, while others overlap and partly hide each other. And\r\nconsider how keenly every particle of this wondrous cloth of snow is\r\nflashing out jets of light. These are the main features of the\r\nbeautiful and terrible picture as seen from the forest window; and it\r\nwould still be surpassingly glorious were the fore- and middle-grounds\r\nobliterated altogether, leaving only the black peaks, the white\r\nbanners, and the blue sky.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KOLANA ROCK, HETCH-HETCHY VALLEY]\r\n\r\nGlancing now in a general way at the formation of snow-banners, we find\r\nthat the main causes of the wondrous beauty and perfection of those we\r\nhave been contemplating were the favorable direction and great force of\r\nthe wind, the abundance of snow-dust, and the peculiar conformation of\r\nthe slopes of the peaks. It is essential not only that the wind should\r\nmove with great velocity and steadiness to supply a sufficiently\r\ncopious and continuous stream of snow-dust, but that it should come\r\nfrom the north. No perfect banner is ever hung on the Sierra peaks by a\r\nsouth wind. Had the gale that day blown from the south, leaving other\r\nconditions unchanged, only a dull, confused, fog-like drift would have\r\nbeen produced; for the snow, instead of being spouted up over the tops\r\nof the peaks in concentrated currents to be drawn out as streamers,\r\nwould have been shed off around the sides, and piled down into the\r\nglacier wombs. The cause of the concentrated action of the north wind\r\nis found in the peculiar form of the north sides of the peaks, where\r\nthe amphitheaters of the residual glaciers are. In general the south\r\nsides are convex and irregular, while the north sides are concave both\r\nin their vertical and horizontal sections; the wind in ascending these\r\ncurves converges toward the summits, carrying the snow in concentrating\r\ncurrents with it, shooting it almost straight up into the air above the\r\npeaks, from which it is then carried away in a horizontal direction.\r\n\r\nThis difference in form between the north and south sides of the peaks\r\nwas almost wholly produced by the difference in the kind and quantity\r\nof the glaciation to which they have been subjected, the north sides\r\nhaving been hollowed by residual shadow-glaciers of a form that never\r\nexisted on the sun-beaten sides.\r\n\r\nIt appears, therefore, that shadows in great part determine not only\r\nthe forms of lofty icy mountains, but also those of the snow-banners\r\nthat the wild winds hang on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nA NEAR VIEW OF THE HIGH SIERRA\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly one bright morning in the middle of Indian summer, while the\r\nglacier meadows were still crisp with frost crystals, I set out from\r\nthe foot of Mount Lyell, on my way down to Yosemite Valley, to\r\nreplenish my exhausted store of bread and tea. I had spent the past\r\nsummer, as many preceding ones, exploring the glaciers that lie on the\r\nhead waters of the San Joaquin, Tuolumne, Merced, and Owen\xe2\x80\x99s rivers;\r\nmeasuring and studying their movements, trends, crevasses, moraines,\r\netc., and the part they had played during the period of their greater\r\nextension in the creation and development of the landscapes of this\r\nalpine wonderland. The time for this kind of work was nearly over for\r\nthe year, and I began to look forward with delight to the approaching\r\nwinter with its wondrous storms, when I would be warmly snow-bound in\r\nmy Yosemite cabin with plenty of bread and books; but a tinge of regret\r\ncame on when I considered that possibly I might not see this favorite\r\nregion again until the next summer, excepting distant views from the\r\nheights about the Yosemite walls.\r\n\r\nTo artists, few portions of the High Sierra are, strictly speaking,\r\npicturesque. The whole massive uplift of the range is one great\r\npicture, not clearly divisible into smaller ones; differing much in\r\nthis respect from the older, and what may be called, riper mountains of\r\nthe Coast Range. All the landscapes of the Sierra, as we have seen,\r\nwere born again, remodeled from base to summit by the developing\r\nice-floods of the last glacial winter. But all those new landscapes\r\nwere not brought forth simultaneously; some of the highest, where the\r\nice lingered longest, are tens of centuries younger than those of the\r\nwarmer regions below them. In general, the younger the\r\nmountain-landscapes,\xe2\x80\x94younger, I mean, with reference to the time of\r\ntheir emergence from the ice of the glacial period,\xe2\x80\x94the less separable\r\nare they into artistic bits capable of being made into warm,\r\nsympathetic, lovable pictures with appreciable humanity in them.\r\n\r\nHere, however, on the head waters of the Tuolumne, is a group of wild\r\npeaks on which the geologist may say that the sun has but just begun to\r\nshine, which is yet in a high degree picturesque, and in its main\r\nfeatures so regular and evenly balanced as almost to appear\r\nconventional\xe2\x80\x94one somber cluster of snow-laden peaks with gray\r\npine-fringed granite bosses braided around its base, the whole surging\r\nfree into the sky from the head of a magnificent valley, whose lofty\r\nwalls are beveled away on both sides so as to embrace it all without\r\nadmitting anything not strictly belonging to it. The foreground was now\r\naflame with autumn colors, brown and purple and gold, ripe in the\r\nmellow sunshine; contrasting brightly with the deep, cobalt blue of the\r\nsky, and the black and gray, and pure, spiritual white of the rocks and\r\nglaciers. Down through the midst, the young Tuolumne was seen pouring\r\nfrom its crystal fountains, now resting in glassy pools as if changing\r\nback again into ice, now leaping in white cascades as if turning to\r\nsnow; gliding right and left between granite bosses, then sweeping on\r\nthrough the smooth, meadowy levels of the valley, swaying pensively\r\nfrom side to side with calm, stately gestures past dipping willows and\r\nsedges, and around groves of arrowy pine; and throughout its whole\r\neventful course, whether flowing fast or slow, singing loud or low,\r\never filling the landscape with spiritual animation, and manifesting\r\nthe grandeur of its sources in every movement and tone.\r\n\r\nPursuing my lonely way down the valley, I turned again and again to\r\ngaze on the glorious picture, throwing up my arms to inclose it as in a\r\nframe. After long ages of growth in the darkness beneath the glaciers,\r\nthrough sunshine and storms, it seemed now to be ready and waiting for\r\nthe elected artist, like yellow wheat for the reaper; and I could not\r\nhelp wishing that I might carry colors and brushes with me on my\r\ntravels, and learn to paint. In the mean time I had to be content with\r\nphotographs on my mind and sketches in my note-books. At length, after\r\nI had rounded a precipitous headland that puts out from the west wall\r\nof the valley, every peak vanished from sight, and I pushed rapidly\r\nalong the frozen meadows, over the divide between the waters of the\r\nMerced and Tuolumne, and down through the forests that clothe the\r\nslopes of Cloud\xe2\x80\x99s Rest, arriving in Yosemite in due time\xe2\x80\x94which, with\r\nme, is _any_ time. And, strange to say, among the first people I met\r\nhere were two artists who, with letters of introduction, were awaiting\r\nmy return. They inquired whether in the course of my explorations in\r\nthe adjacent mountains I had ever come upon a landscape suitable for a\r\nlarge painting; whereupon I began a description of the one that had so\r\nlately excited my admiration. Then, as I went on further and further\r\ninto details, their faces began to glow, and I offered to guide them to\r\nit, while they declared that they would gladly follow, far or near,\r\nwhithersoever I could spare the time to lead them.\r\n\r\nSince storms might come breaking down through the fine weather at any\r\ntime, burying the colors in snow, and cutting off the artists\xe2\x80\x99 retreat,\r\nI advised getting ready at once.\r\n\r\nI led them out of the valley by the Vernal and Nevada Falls, thence\r\nover the main dividing ridge to the Big Tuolumne Meadows, by the old\r\nMono trail, and thence along the upper Tuolumne River to its head. This\r\nwas my companions\xe2\x80\x99 first excursion into the High Sierra, and as I was\r\nalmost always alone in my mountaineering, the way that the fresh beauty\r\nwas reflected in their faces made for me a novel and interesting study.\r\nThey naturally were affected most of all by the colors\xe2\x80\x94the intense\r\nazure of the sky, the purplish grays of the granite, the red and browns\r\nof dry meadows, and the translucent purple and crimson of huckleberry\r\nbogs; the flaming yellow of aspen groves, the silvery flashing of the\r\nstreams, and the bright green and blue of the glacier lakes. But the\r\ngeneral expression of the scenery\xe2\x80\x94rocky and savage\xe2\x80\x94seemed sadly\r\ndisappointing; and as they threaded the forest from ridge to ridge,\r\neagerly scanning the landscapes as they were unfolded, they said: \xe2\x80\x9cAll\r\nthis is huge and sublime, but we see nothing as yet at all available\r\nfor effective pictures. Art is long, and art is limited, you know; and\r\nhere are foregrounds, middle-grounds, backgrounds, all alike; bare\r\nrock-waves, woods, groves, diminutive flecks of meadow, and strips of\r\nglittering water.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9conly bide a wee, and I\r\nwill show you something you will like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt length, toward the end of the second day, the Sierra Crown began to\r\ncome into view, and when we had fairly rounded the projecting headland\r\nbefore mentioned, the whole picture stood revealed in the flush of the\r\nalpenglow. Their enthusiasm was excited beyond bounds, and the more\r\nimpulsive of the two, a young Scotchman, dashed ahead, shouting and\r\ngesticulating and tossing his arms in the air like a madman. Here, at\r\nlast, was a typical alpine landscape.\r\n\r\nAfter feasting awhile on the view, I proceeded to make camp in a\r\nsheltered grove a little way back from the meadow, where pine-boughs\r\ncould be obtained for beds, and where there was plenty of dry wood for\r\nfires, while the artists ran here and there, along the river-bends and\r\nup the sides of the ca\xc3\xb1on, choosing foregrounds for sketches. After\r\ndark, when our tea was made and a rousing fire had been built, we began\r\nto make our plans. They decided to remain several days, at the least,\r\nwhile I concluded to make an excursion in the mean time to the\r\nuntouched summit of Ritter.\r\n\r\nIt was now about the middle of October, the springtime of snow-flowers.\r\nThe first winter-clouds had already bloomed, and the peaks were strewn\r\nwith fresh crystals, without, however, affecting the climbing to any\r\ndangerous extent. And as the weather was still profoundly calm, and the\r\ndistance to the foot of the mountain only a little more than a day, I\r\nfelt that I was running no great risk of being storm-bound.\r\n\r\nMount Ritter is king of the mountains of the middle portion of the High\r\nSierra, as Shasta of the north and Whitney of the south sections.\r\nMoreover, as far as I know, it had never been climbed. I had explored\r\nthe adjacent wilderness summer after summer, but my studies thus far\r\nhad never drawn me to the top of it. Its height above sea-level is\r\nabout 13,300 feet, and it is fenced round by steeply inclined glaciers,\r\nand ca\xc3\xb1ons of tremendous depth and ruggedness, which render it almost\r\ninaccessible. But difficulties of this kind only exhilarate the\r\nmountaineer.\r\n\r\nNext morning, the artists went heartily to their work and I to mine.\r\nFormer experiences had given good reason to know that passionate\r\nstorms, invisible as yet, might be brooding in the calm sun-gold;\r\ntherefore, before bidding farewell, I warned the artists not to be\r\nalarmed should I fail to appear before a week or ten days, and advised\r\nthem, in case a snow-storm should set in, to keep up big fires and\r\nshelter themselves as best they could, and on no account to become\r\nfrightened and attempt to seek their way back to Yosemite alone through\r\nthe drifts.\r\n\r\nMy general plan was simply this: to scale the ca\xc3\xb1on, wall, cross over\r\nto the eastern flank of the range, and then make my way southward to\r\nthe northern spurs of Mount Ritter in compliance with the intervening\r\ntopography; for to push on directly southward from camp through the\r\ninnumerable peaks and pinnacles that adorn this portion of the axis of\r\nthe range, however interesting, would take too much time, besides being\r\nextremely difficult and dangerous at this time of year.\r\n\r\nAll my first day was pure pleasure; simply mountaineering indulgence,\r\ncrossing the dry pathways of the ancient glaciers, tracing happy\r\nstreams, and learning the habits of the birds and marmots in the groves\r\nand rocks. Before I had gone a mile from camp, I came to the foot of a\r\nwhite cascade that beats its way down a rugged gorge in the ca\xc3\xb1on wall,\r\nfrom a height of about nine hundred feet, and pours its throbbing\r\nwaters into the Tuolumne. I was acquainted with its fountains, which,\r\nfortunately, lay in my course. What a fine traveling companion it\r\nproved to be, what songs it sang, and how passionately it told the\r\nmountain\xe2\x80\x99s own joy! Gladly I climbed along its dashing border,\r\nabsorbing its divine music, and bathing from time to time in waftings\r\nof irised spray. Climbing higher, higher, now beauty came streaming on\r\nthe sight: painted meadows, late-blooming gardens, peaks of rare\r\narchitecture, lakes here and there, shining like silver, and glimpses\r\nof the forested middle region and the yellow lowlands far in the west.\r\nBeyond the range I saw the so-called Mono Desert, lying dreamily silent\r\nin thick purple light\xe2\x80\x94a desert of heavy sun-glare beheld from a desert\r\nof ice-burnished granite. Here the waters divide, shouting in glorious\r\nenthusiasm, and falling eastward to vanish in the volcanic sands and\r\ndry sky of the Great Basin, or westward to the Great Valley of\r\nCalifornia, and thence through the Bay of San Francisco and the Golden\r\nGate to the sea.\r\n\r\nPassing a little way down over the summit until I had reached an\r\nelevation of about 10,000 feet, I pushed on southward toward a group of\r\nsavage peaks that stand guard about Ritter on the north and west,\r\ngroping my way, and dealing instinctively with every obstacle as it\r\npresented itself. Here a huge gorge would be found cutting across my\r\npath, along the dizzy edge of which I scrambled until some less\r\nprecipitous point was discovered where I might safely venture to the\r\nbottom and then, selecting some feasible portion of the opposite wall,\r\nreascend with the same slow caution. Massive, flat-topped spurs\r\nalternate with the gorges, plunging abruptly from the shoulders of the\r\nsnowy peaks, and planting their feet in the warm desert. These were\r\neverywhere marked and adorned with characteristic sculptures of the\r\nancient glaciers that swept over this entire region like one vast\r\nice-wind, and the polished surfaces produced by the ponderous flood are\r\nstill so perfectly preserved that in many places the sunlight reflected\r\nfrom them is about as trying to the eyes as sheets of snow.\r\n\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s glacial-mills grind slowly, but they have been kept in motion\r\nlong enough in California to grind sufficient soil for a glorious\r\nabundance of life, though most of the grist has been carried to the\r\nlowlands, leaving these high regions comparatively lean and bare; while\r\nthe post-glacial agents of erosion have not yet furnished sufficient\r\navailable food over the general surface for more than a few tufts of\r\nthe hardiest plants, chiefly carices and eriogonae. And it is\r\ninteresting to learn in this connection that the sparseness and\r\nrepressed character of the vegetation at this height is caused more by\r\nwant of soil than by harshness of climate; for, here and there, in\r\nsheltered hollows (countersunk beneath the general surface) into which\r\na few rods of well-ground moraine chips have been dumped, we find\r\ngroves of spruce and pine thirty to forty feet high, trimmed around the\r\nedges with willow and huckleberry bushes, and oftentimes still further\r\nby an outer ring of tall grasses, bright with lupines, larkspurs, and\r\nshowy columbines, suggesting a climate by no means repressingly severe.\r\nAll the streams, too, and the pools at this elevation are furnished\r\nwith little gardens wherever soil can be made to lie, which, though\r\nmaking scarce any show at a distance, constitute charming surprises to\r\nthe appreciative observer. In these bits of leanness a few birds find\r\ngrateful homes. Having no acquaintance with man, they fear no ill, and\r\nflock curiously about the stranger, almost allowing themselves to be\r\ntaken in the hand. In so wild and so beautiful a region was spent my\r\nfirst day, every sight and sound inspiring, leading one far out of\r\nhimself, yet feeding and building up his individuality.\r\n\r\nNow came the solemn, silent evening. Long, blue, spiky shadows crept\r\nout across the snow-fields, while a rosy glow, at first scarce\r\ndiscernible, gradually deepened and suffused every mountain-top,\r\nflushing the glaciers and the harsh crags above them. This was the\r\nalpenglow, to me one of the most impressive of all the terrestrial\r\nmanifestations of God. At the touch of this divine light, the mountains\r\nseemed to kindle to a rapt, religious consciousness, and stood hushed\r\nand waiting like devout worshipers. Just before the alpenglow began to\r\nfade, two crimson clouds came streaming across the summit like wings of\r\nflame, rendering the sublime scene yet more impressive; then came\r\ndarkness and the stars.\r\n\r\nIcy Ritter was still miles away, but I could proceed no farther that\r\nnight. I found a good campground on the rim of a glacier basin about\r\n11,000 feet above the sea. A small lake nestles in the bottom of it,\r\nfrom which I got water for my tea, and a storm-beaten thicket near by\r\nfurnished abundance of resiny fire-wood. Somber peaks, hacked and\r\nshattered, circled half-way around the horizon, wearing a savage aspect\r\nin the gloaming, and a waterfall chanted solemnly across the lake on\r\nits way down from the foot of a glacier. The fall and the lake and the\r\nglacier were almost equally bare; while the scraggy pines anchored in\r\nthe rock-fissures were so dwarfed and shorn by storm-winds that you\r\nmight walk over their tops. In tone and aspect the scene was one of the\r\nmost desolate I ever beheld. But the darkest scriptures of the\r\nmountains are illumined with bright passages of love that never fail to\r\nmake themselves felt when one is alone.\r\n\r\nI made my bed in a nook of the pine-thicket, where the branches were\r\npressed and crinkled overhead like a roof, and bent down around the\r\nsides. These are the best bedchambers the high mountains afford\xe2\x80\x94snug as\r\nsquirrel-nests, well ventilated, full of spicy odors, and with plenty\r\nof wind-played needles to sing one asleep. I little expected company,\r\nbut, creeping in through a low side-door, I found five or six birds\r\nnestling among the tassels. The night-wind began to blow soon after\r\ndark; at first only a gentle breathing, but increasing toward midnight\r\nto a rough gale that fell upon my leafy roof in ragged surges like a\r\ncascade, bearing wild sounds from the crags overhead. The waterfall\r\nsang in chorus, filling the old ice-fountain with its solemn roar, and\r\nseeming to increase in power as the night advanced\xe2\x80\x94fit voice for such a\r\nlandscape. I had to creep out many times to the fire during the night,\r\nfor it was biting cold and I had no blankets. Gladly I welcomed the\r\nmorning star.\r\n\r\nThe dawn in the dry, wavering air of the desert was glorious.\r\nEverything encouraged my undertaking and betokened success. There was\r\nno cloud in the sky, no storm-tone in the wind. Breakfast of bread and\r\ntea was soon made. I fastened a hard, durable crust to my belt by way\r\nof provision, in case I should be compelled to pass a night on the\r\nmountain-top; then, securing the remainder of my little stock against\r\nwolves and wood-rats, I set forth free and hopeful.\r\n\r\nHow glorious a greeting the sun gives the mountains! To behold this\r\nalone is worth the pains of any excursion a thousand times over. The\r\nhighest peaks burned like islands in a sea of liquid shade. Then the\r\nlower peaks and spires caught the glow, and long lances of light,\r\nstreaming through many a notch and pass, fell thick on the frozen\r\nmeadows. The majestic form of Ritter was full in sight, and I pushed\r\nrapidly on over rounded rock-bosses and pavements, my iron-shod shoes\r\nmaking a clanking sound, suddenly hushed now and then in rugs of\r\nbryanthus, and sedgy lake-margins soft as moss. Here, too, in this\r\nso-called \xe2\x80\x9cland of desolation,\xe2\x80\x9d I met cassiope, growing in fringes\r\namong the battered rocks. Her blossoms had faded long ago, but they\r\nwere still clinging with happy memories to the evergreen sprays, and\r\nstill so beautiful as to thrill every fiber of one\xe2\x80\x99s being. Winter and\r\nsummer, you may hear her voice, the low, sweet melody of her purple\r\nbells. No evangel among all the mountain plants speaks Nature\xe2\x80\x99s love\r\nmore plainly than cassiope. Where she dwells, the redemption of the\r\ncoldest solitude is complete. The very rocks and glaciers seem to feel\r\nher presence, and become imbued with her own fountain sweetness. All\r\nthings were warming and awakening. Frozen rills began to flow, the\r\nmarmots came out of their nests in boulder-piles and climbed sunny\r\nrocks to bask, and the dun-headed sparrows were flitting about seeking\r\ntheir breakfasts. The lakes seen from every ridge-top were brilliantly\r\nrippled and spangled, shimmering like the thickets of the low Dwarf\r\nPines. The rocks, too, seemed responsive to the vital\r\nheat\xe2\x80\x94rock-crystals and snow-crystals thrilling alike. I strode on\r\nexhilarated, as if never more to feel fatigue, limbs moving of\r\nthemselves, every sense unfolding like the thawing flowers, to take\r\npart in the new day harmony.\r\n\r\nAll along my course thus far, excepting when down in the ca\xc3\xb1ons, the\r\nlandscapes were mostly open to me, and expansive, at least on one side.\r\nOn the left were the purple plains of Mono, reposing dreamily and warm;\r\non the right, the near peaks springing keenly into the thin sky with\r\nmore and more impressive sublimity. But these larger views were at\r\nlength lost. Rugged spurs, and moraines, and huge, projecting\r\nbuttresses began to shut me in. Every feature became more rigidly\r\nalpine, without, however, producing any chilling effect; for going to\r\nthe mountains is like going home. We always find that the strangest\r\nobjects in these fountain wilds are in some degree familiar, and we\r\nlook upon them with a vague sense of having seen them before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL GRANT TREE, GENERAL GRANT NATIONAL PARK]\r\n\r\nOn the southern shore of a frozen lake, I encountered an extensive\r\nfield of hard, granular snow, up which I scampered in fine tone,\r\nintending to follow it to its head, and cross the rocky spur against\r\nwhich it leans, hoping thus to come direct upon the base of the main\r\nRitter peak. The surface was pitted with oval hollows, made by stones\r\nand drifted pine-needles that had melted themselves into the mass by\r\nthe radiation of absorbed sun-heat. These afforded good footholds, but\r\nthe surface curved more and more steeply at the head, and the pits\r\nbecame shallower and less abundant, until I found myself in danger of\r\nbeing shed off like avalanching snow. I persisted, however, creeping on\r\nall fours, and shuffling up the smoothest places on my back, as I had\r\noften done on burnished granite, until, after slipping several times, I\r\nwas compelled to retrace my course to the bottom, and make my way\r\naround the west end of the lake, and thence up to the summit of the\r\ndivide between the head waters of Rush Creek and the northernmost\r\ntributaries of the San Joaquin.\r\n\r\nArriving on the summit of this dividing crest, one of the most exciting\r\npieces of pure wilderness was disclosed that I ever discovered in all\r\nmy mountaineering. There, immediately in front, loomed the majestic\r\nmass of Mount Ritter, with a glacier swooping down its face nearly to\r\nmy feet, then curving westward and pouring its frozen flood into a dark\r\nblue lake, whose shores were bound with precipices of crystalline snow;\r\nwhile a deep chasm drawn between the divide and the glacier separated\r\nthe massive picture from everything else. I could see only the one\r\nsublime mountain, the one glacier, the one lake; the whole veiled with\r\none blue shadow\xe2\x80\x94rock, ice, and water close together without a single\r\nleaf or sign of life. After gazing spellbound, I began instinctively to\r\nscrutinize every notch and gorge and weathered buttress of the\r\nmountain, with reference to making the ascent. The entire front above\r\nthe glacier appeared as one tremendous precipice, slightly receding at\r\nthe top, and bristling with spires and pinnacles set above one another\r\nin formidable array. Massive lichen-stained battlements stood forward\r\nhere and there, hacked at the top with angular notches, and separated\r\nby frosty gullies and recesses that have been veiled in shadow ever\r\nsince their creation; while to right and left, as far as I could see,\r\nwere huge, crumbling buttresses, offering no hope to the climber. The\r\nhead of the glacier sends up a few finger-like branches through narrow\r\n_couloirs_; but these seemed too steep and short to be available,\r\nespecially as I had no ax with which to cut steps, and the numerous\r\nnarrow-throated gullies down which stones and snow are avalanched\r\nseemed hopelessly steep, besides being interrupted by vertical cliffs;\r\nwhile the whole front was rendered still more terribly forbidding by\r\nthe chill shadow and the gloomy blackness of the rocks.\r\n\r\nDescending the divide in a hesitating mood, I picked my way across the\r\nyawning chasm at the foot, and climbed out upon the glacier. There were\r\nno meadows now to cheer with their brave colors, nor could I hear the\r\ndun-headed sparrows, whose cheery notes so often relieve the silence of\r\nour highest mountains. The only sounds were the gurgling of small rills\r\ndown in the veins and crevasses of the glacier, and now and then the\r\nrattling report of falling stones, with the echoes they shot out into\r\nthe crisp air.\r\n\r\nI could not distinctly hope to reach the summit from this side, yet I\r\nmoved on across the glacier as if driven by fate. Contending with\r\nmyself, the season is too far spent, I said, and even should I be\r\nsuccessful, I might be storm-bound on the mountain; and in the\r\ncloud-darkness, with the cliffs and crevasses covered with snow, how\r\ncould I escape? No; I must wait till next summer. I would only approach\r\nthe mountain now, and inspect it, creep about its flanks, learn what I\r\ncould of its history, holding myself ready to flee on the approach of\r\nthe first storm-cloud. But we little know until tried how much of the\r\nuncontrollable there is in us, urging across glaciers and torrents, and\r\nup dangerous heights, let the judgment forbid as it may.\r\n\r\nI succeeded in gaining the foot of the cliff on the eastern extremity\r\nof the glacier, and there discovered the mouth of a narrow avalanche\r\ngully, through which I began to climb, intending to follow it as far as\r\npossible, and at least obtain some fine wild views for my pains. Its\r\ngeneral course is oblique to the plane of the mountain-face, and the\r\nmetamorphic slates of which the mountain is built are cut by cleavage\r\nplanes in such a way that they weather off in angular blocks, giving\r\nrise to irregular steps that greatly facilitate climbing on the sheer\r\nplaces. I thus made my way into a wilderness of crumbling spires and\r\nbattlements, built together in bewildering combinations, and glazed in\r\nmany places with a thin coating of ice, which I had to hammer off with\r\nstones. The situation was becoming gradually more perilous; but, having\r\npassed several dangerous spots, I dared not think of descending; for,\r\nso steep was the entire ascent, one would inevitably fall to the\r\nglacier in case a single misstep were made. Knowing, therefore, the\r\ntried danger beneath, I became all the more anxious concerning the\r\ndevelopments to be made above, and began to be conscious of a vague\r\nforeboding of what actually befell; not that I was given to fear, but\r\nrather because my instincts, usually so positive and true, seemed\r\nvitiated in some way, and were leading me astray. At length, after\r\nattaining an elevation of about 12,800 feet, I found myself at the foot\r\nof a sheer drop in the bed of the avalanche channel I was tracing,\r\nwhich seemed absolutely to bar further progress. It was only about\r\nforty-five or fifty feet high, and somewhat roughened by fissures and\r\nprojections; but these seemed so slight and insecure, as footholds,\r\nthat I tried hard to avoid the precipice altogether, by scaling the\r\nwall of the channel on either side. But, though less steep, the walls\r\nwere smoother than the obstructing rock, and repeated efforts only\r\nshowed that I must either go right ahead or turn back. The tried\r\ndangers beneath seemed even greater than that of the cliff in front;\r\ntherefore, after scanning its face again and again, I began to scale\r\nit, picking my holds with intense caution. After gaining a point about\r\nhalfway to the top, I was suddenly brought to a dead stop, with arms\r\noutspread, clinging close to the face of the rock, unable to move hand\r\nor foot either up or down. My doom appeared fixed. I _must_ fall. There\r\nwould be a moment of bewilderment, and then a lifeless rumble down the\r\none general precipice to the glacier below.\r\n\r\nWhen this final danger flashed upon me, I became nerve-shaken for the\r\nfirst time since setting foot on the mountains, and my mind seemed to\r\nfill with a stifling smoke. But this terrible eclipse lasted only a\r\nmoment, when life blazed forth again with preternatural clearness. I\r\nseemed suddenly to become possessed of a new sense. The other self,\r\nbygone experiences, Instinct, or Guardian Angel,\xe2\x80\x94call it what you\r\nwill,\xe2\x80\x94came forward and assumed control. Then my trembling muscles\r\nbecame firm again, every rift and flaw in the rock was seen as through\r\na microscope, and my limbs moved with a positiveness and precision with\r\nwhich I seemed to have nothing at all to do. Had I been borne aloft\r\nupon wings, my deliverance could not have been more complete.\r\n\r\nAbove this memorable spot, the face of the mountain is still more\r\nsavagely hacked and torn. It is a maze of yawning chasms and gullies,\r\nin the angles of which rise beetling crags and piles of detached\r\nboulders that seem to have been gotten ready to be launched below. But\r\nthe strange influx of strength I had received seemed inexhaustible. I\r\nfound a way without effort, and soon stood upon the topmost crag in the\r\nblessed light.\r\n\r\nHow truly glorious the landscape circled around this noble\r\nsummit!\xe2\x80\x94giant mountains, valleys innumerable, glaciers and meadows,\r\nrivers and lakes, with the wide blue sky bent tenderly over them all.\r\nBut in my first hour of freedom from that terrible shadow, the sunlight\r\nin which I was laving seemed all in all.\r\n\r\nLooking southward along the axis of the range, the eye is first caught\r\nby a row of exceedingly sharp and slender spires, which rise openly to\r\na height of about a thousand feet, above a series of short, residual\r\nglaciers that lean back against their bases; their fantastic sculpture\r\nand the unrelieved sharpness with which they spring out of the ice\r\nrendering them peculiarly wild and striking. These are \xe2\x80\x9cThe Minarets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBeyond them you behold a sublime wilderness of mountains, their snowy\r\nsummits towering together in crowded abundance, peak beyond peak,\r\nswelling higher, higher as they sweep on southward, until the\r\nculminating point of the range is reached on Mount Whitney, near the\r\nhead of the Kern River, at an elevation of nearly 14,700 feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea.\r\n\r\nWestward, the general flank of the range is seen flowing sublimely away\r\nfrom the sharp summits, in smooth undulations; a sea of huge gray\r\ngranite waves dotted with lakes and meadows, and fluted with stupendous\r\nca\xc3\xb1ons that grow steadily deeper as they recede in the distance. Below\r\nthis gray region lies the dark forest zone, broken here and there by\r\nupswelling ridges and domes; and yet beyond lies a yellow, hazy belt,\r\nmarking the broad plain of the San Joaquin, bounded on its farther side\r\nby the blue mountains of the coast.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the northward, there in the immediate foreground is the\r\nglorious Sierra Crown, with Cathedral Peak, a temple of marvelous\r\narchitecture, a few degrees to the left of it; the gray, massive form\r\nof Mammoth Mountain to the right; while Mounts Ord, Gibbs, Dana,\r\nConness, Tower Peak, Castle Peak, Silver Mountain, and a host of noble\r\ncompanions, as yet nameless, make a sublime show along the axis of the\r\nrange.\r\n\r\nEastward, the whole region seems a land of desolation covered with\r\nbeautiful light. The torrid volcanic basin of Mono, with its one bare\r\nlake fourteen miles long; Owen\xe2\x80\x99s Valley and the broad lava table-land\r\nat its head, dotted with craters, and the massive Inyo Range, rivaling\r\neven the Sierra in height; these are spread, map-like, beneath you,\r\nwith countless ranges beyond, passing and overlapping one another and\r\nfading on the glowing horizon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE YOSEMITE VALLEY]\r\n\r\nAt a distance of less than 3000 feet below the summit of Mount Ritter\r\nyou may find tributaries of the San Joaquin and Owen\xe2\x80\x99s rivers, bursting\r\nforth from the ice and snow of the glaciers that load its flanks; while\r\na little to the north of here are found the highest affluents of the\r\nTuolumne and Merced. Thus, the fountains of four of the principal\r\nrivers of California are within a radius of four or five miles.\r\n\r\nLakes are seen gleaming in all sorts of places,\xe2\x80\x94round, or oval, or\r\nsquare, like very mirrors; others narrow and sinuous, drawn close\r\naround the peaks like silver zones, the highest reflecting only rocks,\r\nsnow, and the sky. But neither these nor the glaciers, nor the bits of\r\nbrown meadow and moorland that occur here and there, are large enough\r\nto make any marked impression upon the mighty wilderness of mountains.\r\nThe eye, rejoicing in its freedom, roves about the vast expanse, yet\r\nreturns again and again to the fountain peaks. Perhaps some one of the\r\nmultitude excites special attention, some gigantic castle with turret\r\nand battlement, or some Gothic cathedral more abundantly spired than\r\nMilan\xe2\x80\x99s. But, generally, when looking for the first time from an\r\nall-embracing standpoint like this, the inexperienced observer is\r\noppressed by the incomprehensible grandeur, variety, and abundance of\r\nthe mountains rising shoulder to shoulder beyond the reach of vision;\r\nand it is only after they have been studied one by one, long and\r\nlovingly, that their far-reaching harmonies become manifest. Then,\r\npenetrate the wilderness where you may, the main telling features, to\r\nwhich all the surrounding topography is subordinate, are quickly\r\nperceived, and the most complicated clusters of peaks stand revealed\r\nharmoniously correlated and fashioned like works of art\xe2\x80\x94eloquent\r\nmonuments of the ancient ice-rivers that brought them into relief from\r\nthe general mass of the range. The ca\xc3\xb1ons, too, some of them a mile\r\ndeep, mazing wildly through the mighty host of mountains, however\r\nlawless and ungovernable at first sight they appear, are at length\r\nrecognized as the necessary effects of causes which followed each other\r\nin harmonious sequence\xe2\x80\x94Nature\xe2\x80\x99s poems carved on tables of stone\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nsimplest and most emphatic of her glacial compositions.\r\n\r\nCould we have been here to observe during the glacial period, we should\r\nhave overlooked a wrinkled ocean of ice as continuous as that now\r\ncovering the landscapes of Greenland; filling every valley and ca\xc3\xb1on\r\nwith only the tops of the fountain peaks rising darkly above the\r\nrock-encumbered ice-waves like islets in a stormy sea\xe2\x80\x94those islets the\r\nonly hints of the glorious landscapes now smiling in the sun. Standing\r\nhere in the deep, brooding silence all the wilderness seems motionless,\r\nas if the work of creation were done. But in the midst of this outer\r\nsteadfastness we know there is incessant motion and change. Ever and\r\nanon, avalanches are falling from yonder peaks. These cliff-bound\r\nglaciers, seemingly wedged and immovable, are flowing like water and\r\ngrinding the rocks beneath them. The lakes are lapping their granite\r\nshores and wearing them away, and every one of these rills and young\r\nrivers is fretting the air into music, and carrying the mountains to\r\nthe plains. Here are the roots of all the life of the valleys, and here\r\nmore simply than elsewhere is the eternal flux of nature manifested.\r\nIce changing to water, lakes to meadows, and mountains to plains. And\r\nwhile we thus contemplate Nature\xe2\x80\x99s methods of landscape creation, and,\r\nreading the records she has carved on the rocks, reconstruct, however\r\nimperfectly, the landscapes of the past, we also learn that as these we\r\nnow behold have succeeded those of the pre-glacial age, so they in turn\r\nare withering and vanishing to be succeeded by others yet unborn.\r\n\r\nBut in the midst of these fine lessons and landscapes, I had to\r\nremember that the sun was wheeling far to the west, while a new way\r\ndown the mountain had to be discovered to some point on the timber line\r\nwhere I could have a fire; for I had not even burdened myself with a\r\ncoat. I first scanned the western spurs, hoping some way might appear\r\nthrough which I might reach the northern glacier, and cross its snout;\r\nor pass around the lake into which it flows, and thus strike my morning\r\ntrack. This route was soon sufficiently unfolded to show that, if\r\npracticable at all, it would require so much time that reaching camp\r\nthat night would be out of the question. I therefore scrambled back\r\neastward, descending the southern slopes obliquely at the same time.\r\nHere the crags seemed less formidable, and the head of a glacier that\r\nflows northeast came in sight, which I determined to follow as far as\r\npossible, hoping thus to make my way to the foot of the peak on the\r\neast side, and thence across the intervening ca\xc3\xb1ons and ridges to camp.\r\n\r\nThe inclination of the glacier is quite moderate at the head, and, as\r\nthe sun had softened the _n\xc3\xa9v\xc3\xa9_, I made safe and rapid progress,\r\nrunning and sliding, and keeping up a sharp outlook for crevasses.\r\nAbout half a mile from the head, there is an ice-cascade, where the\r\nglacier pours over a sharp declivity and is shattered into massive\r\nblocks separated by deep, blue fissures. To thread my way through the\r\nslippery mazes of this crevassed portion seemed impossible, and I\r\nendeavored to avoid it by climbing off to the shoulder of the mountain.\r\nBut the slopes rapidly steepened and at length fell away in sheer\r\nprecipices, compelling a return to the ice. Fortunately, the day had\r\nbeen warm enough to loosen the ice-crystals so as to admit of hollows\r\nbeing dug in the rotten portions of the blocks, thus enabling me to\r\npick my way with far less difficulty than I had anticipated. Continuing\r\ndown over the snout, and along the left lateral moraine, was only a\r\nconfident saunter, showing that the ascent of the mountain by way of\r\nthis glacier is easy, provided one is armed with an ax to cut steps\r\nhere and there.\r\n\r\nThe lower end of the glacier was beautifully waved and barred by the\r\noutcropping edges of the bedded ice-layers which represent the annual\r\nsnowfalls, and to some extent the irregularities of structure caused by\r\nthe weathering of the walls of crevasses, and by separate snowfalls\r\nwhich have been followed by rain, hail, thawing and freezing, etc.\r\nSmall rills were gliding and swirling over the melting surface with a\r\nsmooth, oily appearance, in channels of pure ice\xe2\x80\x94their quick, compliant\r\nmovements contrasting most impressively with the rigid, invisible flow\r\nof the glacier itself, on whose back they all were riding.\r\n\r\nNight drew near before I reached the eastern base of the mountain, and\r\nmy camp lay many a rugged mile to the north; but ultimate success was\r\nassured. It was now only a matter of endurance and ordinary\r\nmountain-craft. The sunset was, if possible, yet more beautiful than\r\nthat of the day before. The Mono landscape seemed to be fairly\r\nsaturated with warm, purple light. The peaks marshaled along the summit\r\nwere in shadow, but through every notch and pass streamed vivid\r\nsun-fire, soothing and irradiating their rough, black angles, while\r\ncompanies of small, luminous clouds hovered above them like very angels\r\nof light.\r\n\r\nDarkness came on, but I found my way by the trends of the ca\xc3\xb1ons and\r\nthe peaks projected against the sky. All excitement died with the\r\nlight, and then I was weary. But the joyful sound of the waterfall\r\nacross the lake was heard at last, and soon the stars were seen\r\nreflected in the lake itself. Taking my bearings from these, I\r\ndiscovered the little pine thicket in which my nest was, and then I had\r\na rest such as only a tired mountaineer may enjoy. After lying loose\r\nand lost for awhile, I made a sunrise fire, went down to the lake,\r\ndashed water on my head, and dipped a cupful for tea. The revival\r\nbrought about by bread and tea was as complete as the exhaustion from\r\nexcessive enjoyment and toil. Then I crept beneath the pine-tassels to\r\nbed. The wind was frosty and the fire burned low, but my sleep was none\r\nthe less sound, and the evening constellations had swept far to the\r\nwest before I awoke.\r\n\r\nAfter thawing and resting in the morning sunshine, I sauntered\r\nhome,\xe2\x80\x94that is, back to the Tuolumne camp,\xe2\x80\x94bearing away toward a cluster\r\nof peaks that hold the fountain snows of one of the north tributaries\r\nof Rush Creek. Here I discovered a group of beautiful glacier lakes,\r\nnestled together in a grand amphitheater. Toward evening, I crossed the\r\ndivide separating the Mono waters from those of the Tuolumne, and\r\nentered the glacier basin that now holds the fountain snows of the\r\nstream that forms the upper Tuolumne cascades. This stream I traced\r\ndown through its many dells and gorges, meadows and bogs, reaching the\r\nbrink of the main Tuolumne at dusk.\r\n\r\nA loud whoop for the artists was answered again and again. Their\r\ncamp-fire came in sight, and half an hour afterward I was with them.\r\nThey seemed unreasonably glad to see me. I had been absent only three\r\ndays; nevertheless, though the weather was fine, they had already been\r\nweighing chances as to whether I would ever return, and trying to\r\ndecide whether they should wait longer or begin to seek their way back\r\nto the lowlands. Now their curious troubles were over. They packed\r\ntheir precious sketches, and next morning we set out homeward bound,\r\nand in two days entered the Yosemite Valley from the north by way of\r\nIndian Ca\xc3\xb1on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nTHE PASSES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sustained grandeur of the High Sierra is strikingly illustrated by\r\nthe great height of the passes. Between latitude 36\xc2\xb0 20\xe2\x80\xb2 and 38\xc2\xb0 the\r\nlowest pass, gap, gorge, or notch of any kind cutting across the axis\r\nof the range, as far as I have discovered, exceeds 9000 feet in height\r\nabove the level of the sea; while the average height of all that are in\r\nuse, either by Indians or whites, is perhaps not less than 11,000 feet,\r\nand not one of these is a carriage-pass.\r\n\r\nFarther north a carriage-road has been constructed through what is\r\nknown as the Sonora Pass, on the head waters of the Stanislaus and\r\nWalker\xe2\x80\x99s rivers, the summit of which is about 10,000 feet above the\r\nsea. Substantial wagon-roads have also been built through the Carson\r\nand Johnson passes, near the head of Lake Tahoe, over which immense\r\nquantities of freight were hauled from California to the mining regions\r\nof Nevada, before the construction of the Central Pacific Railroad.\r\n\r\nStill farther north, a considerable number of comparatively low passes\r\noccur, some of which are accessible to wheeled vehicles, and through\r\nthese rugged defiles during the exciting years of the gold period long\r\nemigrant-trains with foot-sore cattle wearily toiled. After the\r\ntoil-worn adventurers had escaped a thousand dangers and had crawled\r\nthousands of miles across the plains the snowy Sierra at last loomed in\r\nsight, the eastern wall of the land of gold. And as with shaded eyes\r\nthey gazed through the tremulous haze of the desert, with what joy must\r\nthey have descried the pass through which they were to enter the better\r\nland of their hopes and dreams!\r\n\r\nBetween the Sonora Pass and the southern extremity of the High Sierra,\r\na distance of nearly 160 miles, there are only five passes through\r\nwhich trails conduct from one side of the range to the other. These are\r\nbarely practicable for animals; a pass in these regions meaning simply\r\nany notch or ca\xc3\xb1on through which one may, by the exercise of unlimited\r\npatience, make out to lead a mule, or a sure-footed mustang; animals\r\nthat can slide or jump as well as walk. Only three of the five passes\r\nmay be said to be in use, viz.: the Kearsarge, Mono, and Virginia\r\nCreek; the tracks leading through the others being only obscure Indian\r\ntrails, not graded in the least, and scarcely traceable by white men;\r\nfor much of the way is over solid rock and earthquake avalanche\r\ntaluses, where the unshod ponies of the Indians leave no appreciable\r\nsign. Only skilled mountaineers are able to detect the marks that serve\r\nto guide the Indians, such as slight abrasions of the looser rocks, the\r\ndisplacement of stones here and there, and bent bushes and weeds. A\r\ngeneral knowledge of the topography is, then, the main guide, enabling\r\none to determine where the trail ought to go\xe2\x80\x94_must_ go. One of these\r\nIndian trails crosses the range by a nameless pass between the head\r\nwaters of the south and middle forks of the San Joaquin, the other\r\nbetween the north and middle forks of the same river, just to the south\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cThe Minarets\xe2\x80\x9d; this last being about 9000 feet high, is the lowest\r\nof the five. The Kearsarge is the highest, crossing the summit near the\r\nhead of the south fork of King\xe2\x80\x99s River, about eight miles to the north\r\nof Mount Tyndall, through the midst of the most stupendous\r\nrock-scenery. The summit of this pass is over 12,000 feet above\r\nsea-level; nevertheless, it is one of the safest of the five, and is\r\nused every summer, from July to October or November, by hunters,\r\nprospectors, and stock-owners, and to some extent by enterprising\r\npleasure-seekers also. For, besides the surpassing grandeur of the\r\nscenery about the summit, the trail, in ascending the western flank of\r\nthe range, conducts through a grove of the giant Sequoias, and through\r\nthe magnificent Yosemite Valley of the south fork of King\xe2\x80\x99s River. This\r\nis, perhaps, the highest traveled pass on the North American continent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE YOSEMITE VALLEY, SHOWING PRESENT RESERVATION\r\nBOUNDARY.]\r\n\r\nThe Mono Pass lies to the east of Yosemite Valley, at the head of one\r\nof the tributaries of the south fork of the Tuolumne. This is the best\r\nknown and most extensively traveled of all that exist in the High\r\nSierra. A trail was made through it about the time of the Mono gold\r\nexcitement, in the year 1858, by adventurous miners and prospectors\xe2\x80\x94men\r\nwho would build a trail down the throat of darkest Erebus on the way to\r\ngold. Though more than a thousand feet lower than the Kearsarge, it is\r\nscarcely less sublime in rock-scenery, while in snowy, falling water it\r\nfar surpasses it. Being so favorably situated for the stream of\r\nYosemite travel, the more adventurous tourists cross over through this\r\nglorious gateway to the volcanic region around Mono Lake. It has\r\ntherefore gained a name and fame above every other pass in the range.\r\nAccording to the few barometrical observations made upon it, its\r\nhighest point is 10,765 feet above the sea. The other pass of the five\r\nwe have been considering is somewhat lower, and crosses the axis of the\r\nrange a few miles to the north of the Mono Pass, at the head of the\r\nsouthernmost tributary of Walker\xe2\x80\x99s River. It is used chiefly by roaming\r\nbands of the Pah Ute Indians and \xe2\x80\x9csheepmen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, leaving wheels and animals out of the question, the free\r\nmountaineer with a sack of bread on his shoulders and an ax to cut\r\nsteps in ice and frozen snow can make his way across the range almost\r\neverywhere, and at any time of year when the weather is calm. To him\r\nnearly every notch between the peaks is a pass, though much patient\r\nstep-cutting is at times required up and down steeply inclined\r\nglaciers, with cautious climbing over precipices that at first sight\r\nwould seem hopelessly inaccessible.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing my studies, I have crossed from side to side of the range\r\nat intervals of a few miles all along the highest portion of the chain,\r\nwith far less real danger than one would naturally count on. And what\r\nfine wildness was thus revealed\xe2\x80\x94storms and avalanches, lakes and\r\nwaterfalls, gardens and meadows, and interesting animals\xe2\x80\x94only those\r\nwill ever know who give the freest and most buoyant portion of their\r\nlives to climbing and seeing for themselves.\r\n\r\nTo the timid traveler, fresh from the sedimentary levels of the\r\nlowlands, these highways, however picturesque and grand, seem terribly\r\nforbidding\xe2\x80\x94cold, dead, gloomy gashes in the bones of the mountains, and\r\nof all Nature\xe2\x80\x99s ways the ones to be most cautiously avoided. Yet they\r\nare full of the finest and most telling examples of Nature\xe2\x80\x99s love; and\r\nthough hard to travel, none are safer. For they lead through regions\r\nthat lie far above the ordinary haunts of the devil, and of the\r\npestilence that walks in darkness. True, there are innumerable places\r\nwhere the careless step will be the last step; and a rock falling from\r\nthe cliffs may crush without warning like lightning from the sky; but\r\nwhat then! Accidents in the mountains are less common than in the\r\nlowlands, and these mountain mansions are decent, delightful, even\r\ndivine, places to die in, compared with the doleful chambers of\r\ncivilization. Few places in this world are more dangerous than home.\r\nFear not, therefore, to try the mountain-passes. They will kill care,\r\nsave you from deadly apathy, set you free, and call forth every faculty\r\ninto vigorous, enthusiastic action. Even the sick should try these\r\nso-called dangerous passes, because for every unfortunate they kill,\r\nthey cure a thousand.\r\n\r\nAll the passes make their steepest ascents on the eastern flank. On\r\nthis side the average rise is not far from a thousand feet to the mile,\r\nwhile on the west it is about two hundred feet. Another marked\r\ndifference between the eastern and western portions of the passes is\r\nthat the former begin at the very foot of the range, while the latter\r\ncan hardly be said to begin lower than an elevation of from seven to\r\nten thousand feet. Approaching the range from the gray levels of Mono\r\nand Owen\xe2\x80\x99s Valley on the east, the traveler sees before him the steep,\r\nshort passes in full view, fenced in by rugged spurs that come plunging\r\ndown from the shoulders of the peaks on either side, the courses of the\r\nmore direct being disclosed from top to bottom without interruption.\r\nBut from the west one sees nothing of the way he may be seeking until\r\nnear the summit, after days have been spent in threading the forests\r\ngrowing on the main dividing ridges between the river ca\xc3\xb1ons.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe how surely the alp-crossing animals of\r\nevery kind fall into the same trails. The more rugged and inaccessible\r\nthe general character of the topography of any particular region, the\r\nmore surely will the trails of white men, Indians, bears, wild sheep,\r\netc., be found converging into the best passes. The Indians of the\r\nwestern slope venture cautiously over the passes in settled weather to\r\nattend dances, and obtain loads of pine-nuts and the larvae of a small\r\nfly that breeds in Mono and Owen\xe2\x80\x99s lakes, which, when dried, forms an\r\nimportant article of food; while the Pah Utes cross over from the east\r\nto hunt the deer and obtain supplies of acorns; and it is truly\r\nastonishing to see what immense loads the haggard old squaws make out\r\nto carry bare-footed through these rough passes, oftentimes for a\r\ndistance of sixty or seventy miles. They are always accompanied by the\r\nmen, who stride on, unburdened and erect, a little in advance, kindly\r\nstooping at difficult places to pile stepping-stones for their patient,\r\npack-animal wives, just as they would prepare the way for their ponies.\r\n\r\nBears evince great sagacity as mountaineers, but although they are\r\ntireless and enterprising travelers they seldom cross the range. I have\r\nseveral times tracked them through the Mono Pass, but only in late\r\nyears, after cattle and sheep had passed that way, when they doubtless\r\nwere following to feed on the stragglers and on those that had been\r\nkilled by falling over the rocks. Even the wild sheep, the best\r\nmountaineers of all, choose regular passes in making journeys across\r\nthe summits. Deer seldom cross the range in either direction. I have\r\nnever yet observed a single specimen of the mule-deer of the Great\r\nBasin west of the summit, and rarely one of the black-tailed species on\r\nthe eastern slope, notwithstanding many of the latter ascend the range\r\nnearly to the summit every summer, to feed in the wild gardens and\r\nbring forth their young.\r\n\r\nThe glaciers are the pass-makers, and it is by them that the courses of\r\nall mountaineers are predestined. Without exception every pass in the\r\nSierra was created by them without the slightest aid or predetermining\r\nguidance from any of the cataclysmic agents. I have seen elaborate\r\nstatements of the amount of drilling and blasting accomplished in the\r\nconstruction of the railroad across the Sierra, above Donner Lake; but\r\nfor every pound of rock moved in this way, the glaciers which descended\r\neast and west through this same pass, crushed and carried away more\r\nthan a hundred tons.\r\n\r\nThe so-called practicable road-passes are simply those portions of the\r\nrange more degraded by glacial action than the adjacent portions, and\r\ndegraded in such a way as to leave the summits rounded, instead of\r\nsharp; while the peaks, from the superior strength and hardness of\r\ntheir rocks, or from more favorable position, having suffered less\r\ndegradation, are left towering above the passes as if they had been\r\nheaved into the sky by some force acting from beneath.\r\n\r\nThe scenery of all the passes, especially at the head, is of the\r\nwildest and grandest description,\xe2\x80\x94lofty peaks massed together and laden\r\naround their bases with ice and snow; chains of glacier lakes;\r\ncascading streams in endless variety, with glorious views, westward\r\nover a sea of rocks and woods, and eastward over strange ashy plains,\r\nvolcanoes, and the dry, dead-looking ranges of the Great Basin. Every\r\npass, however, possesses treasures of beauty all its own.\r\n\r\nHaving thus in a general way indicated the height, leading features,\r\nand distribution of the principal passes, I will now endeavor to\r\ndescribe the Mono Pass in particular, which may, I think, be regarded\r\nas a fair example of the higher alpine passes in general.\r\n\r\nThe main portion of the Mono Pass is formed by Bloody Ca\xc3\xb1on, which\r\nbegins at the summit of the range, and runs in a general\r\neast-northeasterly direction to the edge of the Mono Plain.\r\n\r\nThe first white men who forced a way through its somber depths were, as\r\nwe have seen, eager gold-seekers. But the ca\xc3\xb1on was known and traveled\r\nas a pass by the Indians and mountain animals long before its discovery\r\nby white men, as is shown by the numerous tributary trails which come\r\ninto it from every direction. Its name accords well with the character\r\nof the \xe2\x80\x9cearly times\xe2\x80\x9d in California, and may perhaps have been suggested\r\nby the predominant color of the metamorphic slates in which it is in\r\ngreat part eroded; or more probably by blood-stains made by the\r\nunfortunate animals which were compelled to slip and shuffle awkwardly\r\nover its rough, cutting rocks. I have never known an animal, either\r\nmule or horse, to make its way through the ca\xc3\xb1on, either in going up or\r\ndown, without losing more or less blood from wounds on the legs.\r\nOccasionally one is killed outright\xe2\x80\x94falling headlong and rolling over\r\nprecipices like a boulder. But such accidents are rarer than from the\r\nterrible appearance of the trail one would be led to expect; the more\r\nexperienced when driven loose find their way over the dangerous places\r\nwith a caution and sagacity that is truly wonderful. During the gold\r\nexcitement it was at times a matter of considerable pecuniary\r\nimportance to force a way through the ca\xc3\xb1on with pack-trains early in\r\nthe spring while it was yet heavily blocked with snow; and then the\r\nmules with their loads had sometimes to be let down over the steepest\r\ndrifts and avalanche beds by means of ropes.\r\n\r\nA good bridle-path leads from Yosemite through many a grove and meadow\r\nup to the head of the ca\xc3\xb1on, a distance of about thirty miles. Here the\r\nscenery undergoes a sudden and startling condensation. Mountains, red,\r\ngray, and black, rise close at hand on the right, whitened around their\r\nbases with banks of enduring snow; on the left swells the huge red mass\r\nof Mount Gibbs, while in front the eye wanders down the shadowy ca\xc3\xb1on,\r\nand out on the warm plain of Mono, where the lake is seen gleaming like\r\na burnished metallic disk, with clusters of lofty volcanic cones to the\r\nsouth of it.\r\n\r\nWhen at length we enter the mountain gateway, the somber rocks seem\r\naware of our presence, and seem to come thronging closer about us.\r\nHappily the ouzel and the old familiar robin are here to sing us\r\nwelcome, and azure daisies beam with trustfulness and sympathy,\r\nenabling us to feel something of Nature\xe2\x80\x99s love even here, beneath the\r\ngaze of her coldest rocks.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this expressive outspokenness on the part of the\r\nca\xc3\xb1on-rocks is greatly enhanced by the quiet aspect of the alpine\r\nmeadows through which we pass just before entering the narrow gateway.\r\nThe forests in which they lie, and the mountain-tops rising beyond\r\nthem, seem quiet and tranquil. We catch their restful spirit, yield to\r\nthe soothing influences of the sunshine, and saunter dreamily on\r\nthrough flowers and bees, scarce touched by a definite thought; then\r\nsuddenly we find ourselves in the shadowy ca\xc3\xb1on, closeted with Nature\r\nin one of her wildest strongholds.\r\n\r\nAfter the first bewildering impression begins to wear off, we perceive\r\nthat it is not altogether terrible; for besides the reassuring birds\r\nand flowers we discover a chain of shining lakelets hanging down from\r\nthe very summit of the pass, and linked together by a silvery stream.\r\nThe highest are set in bleak, rough bowls, scantily fringed with brown\r\nand yellow sedges. Winter storms blow snow through the ca\xc3\xb1on in\r\nblinding drifts, and avalanches shoot from the heights. Then are these\r\nsparkling tarns filled and buried, leaving not a hint of their\r\nexistence. In June and July they begin to blink and thaw out like\r\nsleepy eyes, the carices thrust up their short brown spikes, the\r\ndaisies bloom in turn, and the most profoundly buried of them all is at\r\nlength warmed and summered as if winter were only a dream.\r\n\r\nRed Lake is the lowest of the chain, and also the largest. It seems\r\nrather dull and forbidding at first sight, lying motionless in its\r\ndeep, dark bed. The ca\xc3\xb1on wall rises sheer from the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge on the\r\nsouth, but on the opposite side there is sufficient space and sunshine\r\nfor a sedgy daisy garden, the center of which is brilliantly lighted\r\nwith lilies, castilleias, larkspurs, and columbines, sheltered from the\r\nwind by leafy willows, and forming a most joyful outburst of plant-life\r\nkeenly emphasized by the chill baldness of the onlooking cliffs.\r\n\r\nAfter indulging here in a dozing, shimmering lake-rest, the happy\r\nstream sets forth again, warbling and trilling like an ouzel, ever\r\ndelightfully confiding, no matter how dark the way; leaping, gliding,\r\nhither, thither, clear or foaming: manifesting the beauty of its\r\nwildness in every sound and gesture.\r\n\r\nOne of its most beautiful developments is the Diamond Cascade, situated\r\na short distance below Red Lake. Here the tense, crystalline water is\r\nfirst dashed into coarse, granular spray mixed with dusty foam, and\r\nthen divided into a diamond pattern by following the diagonal\r\ncleavage-joints that intersect the face of the precipice over which it\r\npours. Viewed in front, it resembles a strip of embroidery of definite\r\npattern, varying through the seasons with the temperature and the\r\nvolume of water. Scarce a flower may be seen along its snowy border. A\r\nfew bent pines look on from a distance, and small fringes of cassiope\r\nand rock-ferns are growing in fissures near the head, but these are so\r\nlowly and undemonstrative that only the attentive observer will be\r\nlikely to notice them.\r\n\r\nOn the north wall of the ca\xc3\xb1on, a little below the Diamond Cascade, a\r\nglittering side stream makes its appearance, seeming to leap directly\r\nout of the sky. It first resembles a crinkled ribbon of silver hanging\r\nloosely down the wall, but grows wider as it descends, and dashes the\r\ndull rock with foam. A long rough talus curves up against this part of\r\nthe cliff, overgrown with snow-pressed willows, in which the fall\r\ndisappears with many an eager surge and swirl and plashing leap,\r\nfinally beating its way down to its confluence with the main ca\xc3\xb1on\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nBelow this point the climate is no longer arctic. Butterflies become\r\nlarger and more abundant, grasses with imposing spread of panicle wave\r\nabove your shoulders, and the summery drone of the bumblebee thickens\r\nthe air. The Dwarf Pine, the tree-mountaineer that climbs highest and\r\nbraves the coldest blasts, is found scattered in storm-beaten clumps\r\nfrom the summit of the pass about half-way down the ca\xc3\xb1on. Here it is\r\nsucceeded by the hardy Two-leaved Pine, which is speedily joined by the\r\ntaller Yellow and Mountain Pines. These, with the burly juniper, and\r\nshimmering aspen, rapidly grow larger as the sunshine becomes richer,\r\nforming groves that block the view; or they stand more apart here and\r\nthere in picturesque groups, that make beautiful and obvious harmony\r\nwith the rocks and with one another. Blooming underbrush becomes\r\nabundant,\xe2\x80\x94azalea, spiraea, and the brier-rose weaving fringes for the\r\nstreams, and shaggy rugs to relieve the stern, unflinching rock-bosses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RANCHERIA FALLS, HETCH-HETCHY VALLEY]\r\n\r\nThrough this delightful wilderness, Ca\xc3\xb1on Creek roves without any\r\nconstraining channel, throbbing and wavering; now in sunshine, now in\r\nthoughtful shade; falling, swirling, flashing from side to side in\r\nweariless exuberance of energy. A glorious milky way of cascades is\r\nthus developed, of which Bower Cascade, though one of the smallest, is\r\nperhaps the most beautiful of them all. It is situated in the lower\r\nregion of the pass, just where the sunshine begins to mellow between\r\nthe cold and warm climates. Here the glad creek, grown strong with\r\ntribute gathered from many a snowy fountain on the heights, sings\r\nricher strains, and becomes more human and lovable at every step. Now\r\nyou may by its side find the rose and homely yarrow, and small meadows\r\nfull of bees and clover. At the head of a low-browed rock, luxuriant\r\ndogwood bushes and willows arch over from bank to bank, embowering the\r\nstream with their leafy branches; and drooping plumes, kept in motion\r\nby the current, fringe the brow of the cascade in front. From this\r\nleafy covert the stream leaps out into the light in a fluted curve\r\nthick sown with sparkling crystals, and falls into a pool filled with\r\nbrown boulders, out of which it creeps gray with foam-bells and\r\ndisappears in a tangle of verdure like that from which it came.\r\n\r\nHence, to the foot of the ca\xc3\xb1on, the metamorphic slates give place to\r\ngranite, whose nobler sculpture calls forth expressions of\r\ncorresponding beauty from the stream in passing over it,\xe2\x80\x94bright trills\r\nof rapids, booming notes of falls, solemn hushes of smooth-gliding\r\nsheets, all chanting and blending in glorious harmony. When, at length,\r\nits impetuous alpine life is done, it slips through a meadow with\r\nscarce an audible whisper, and falls asleep in Moraine Lake.\r\n\r\nThis water-bed is one of the finest I ever saw. Evergreens wave\r\nsoothingly about it, and the breath of flowers floats over it like\r\nincense. Here our blessed stream rests from its rocky wanderings, all\r\nits mountaineering done,\xe2\x80\x94no more foaming rock-leaping, no more wild,\r\nexulting song. It falls into a smooth, glassy sleep, stirred only by\r\nthe night-wind, which, coming down the ca\xc3\xb1on, makes it croon and mutter\r\nin ripples along its broidered shores.\r\n\r\nLeaving the lake, it glides quietly through the rushes, destined never\r\nmore to touch the living rock. Henceforth its path lies through ancient\r\nmoraines and reaches of ashy sage-plain, which nowhere afford rocks\r\nsuitable for the development of cascades or sheer falls. Yet this\r\nbeauty of maturity, though less striking, is of a still higher order,\r\nenticing us lovingly on through gentian meadows and groves of rustling\r\naspen to Lake Mono, where, spirit-like, our happy stream vanishes in\r\nvapor, and floats free again in the sky.\r\n\r\nBloody Ca\xc3\xb1on, like every other in the Sierra, was recently occupied by\r\na glacier, which derived its fountain snows from the adjacent summits,\r\nand descended into Mono Lake, at a time when its waters stood at a much\r\nhigher level than now. The principal characters in which the history of\r\nthe ancient glaciers is preserved are displayed here in marvelous\r\nfreshness and simplicity, furnishing the student with extraordinary\r\nadvantages for the acquisition of knowledge of this sort. The most\r\nstriking passages are polished and striated surfaces, which in many\r\nplaces reflect the rays of the sun like smooth water. The dam of Red\r\nLake is an elegantly modeled rib of metamorphic slate, brought into\r\nrelief because of its superior strength, and because of the greater\r\nintensity of the glacial erosion of the rock immediately above it,\r\ncaused by a steeply inclined tributary glacier, which entered the main\r\ntrunk with a heavy down-thrust at the head of the lake.\r\n\r\nMoraine Lake furnishes an equally interesting example of a basin formed\r\nwholly, or in part, by a terminal moraine dam curved across the path of\r\na stream between two lateral moraines.\r\n\r\nAt Moraine Lake the ca\xc3\xb1on proper terminates, although apparently\r\ncontinued by the two lateral moraines of the vanished glacier. These\r\nmoraines are about 300 feet high, and extend unbrokenly from the sides\r\nof the ca\xc3\xb1on into the plain, a distance of about five miles, curving\r\nand tapering in beautiful lines. Their sunward sides are gardens, their\r\nshady sides are groves; the former devoted chiefly to eriogonae,\r\ncompositae, and graminae; a square rod containing five or six profusely\r\nflowered eriogonums of several species, about the same number of bahia\r\nand linosyris, and a few grass tufts; each species being planted trimly\r\napart, with bare gravel between, as if cultivated artificially.\r\n\r\nMy first visit to Bloody Ca\xc3\xb1on was made in the summer of 1869, under\r\ncircumstances well calculated to heighten the impressions that are the\r\npeculiar offspring of mountains. I came from the blooming tangles of\r\nFlorida, and waded out into the plant-gold of the great valley of\r\nCalifornia, when its flora was as yet untrodden. Never before had I\r\nbeheld congregations of social flowers half so extensive or half so\r\nglorious. Golden composite covered all the ground from the Coast Range\r\nto the Sierra like a stratum of curdled sunshine, in which I reveled\r\nfor weeks, watching the rising and setting of their innumerable suns;\r\nthen I gave myself up to be borne forward on the crest of the summer\r\nwave that sweeps annually up the Sierra and spends itself on the snowy\r\nsummits.\r\n\r\nAt the Big Tuolumne Meadows I remained more than a month, sketching,\r\nbotanizing, and climbing among the surrounding mountains. The\r\nmountaineer with whom I then happened to be camping was one of those\r\nremarkable men one so frequently meets in California, the hard angles\r\nand bosses of whose characters have been brought into relief by the\r\ngrinding excitements of the gold period, until they resemble glacial\r\nlandscapes. But at this late day, my friend\xe2\x80\x99s activities had subsided,\r\nand his craving for rest caused him to become a gentle shepherd and\r\nliterally to lie down with the lamb.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the unsatisfiable longings of my Scotch Highland instincts,\r\nhe threw out some hints concerning Bloody Ca\xc3\xb1on, and advised me to\r\nexplore it. \xe2\x80\x9cI have never seen it myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I never was so\r\nunfortunate as to pass that way. But I have heard many a strange story\r\nabout it, and I warrant you will at least find it wild enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen of course I made haste to see it. Early next morning I made up a\r\nbundle of bread, tied my note-book to my belt, and strode away in the\r\nbracing air, full of eager, indefinite hope. The plushy lawns that lay\r\nin my path served to soothe my morning haste. The sod in many places\r\nwas starred with daisies and blue gentians, over which I lingered. I\r\ntraced the paths of the ancient glaciers over many a shining pavement,\r\nand marked the gaps in the upper forests that told the power of the\r\nwinter avalanches. Climbing higher, I saw for the first time the\r\ngradual dwarfing of the pines in compliance with climate, and on the\r\nsummit discovered creeping mats of the arctic willow overgrown with\r\nsilky catkins, and patches of the dwarf vaccinium with its round\r\nflowers sprinkled in the grass like purple hail; while in every\r\ndirection the landscape stretched sublimely away in fresh wildness\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nmanuscript written by the hand of Nature alone.\r\n\r\nAt length, as I entered the pass, the huge rocks began to close around\r\nin all their wild, mysterious impressiveness, when suddenly, as I was\r\ngazing eagerly about me, a drove of gray hairy beings came in sight,\r\nlumbering toward me with a kind of boneless, wallowing motion like\r\nbears.\r\n\r\nI never turn back, though often so inclined, and in this particular\r\ninstance, amid such surroundings, everything seemed singularly\r\nunfavorable for the calm acceptance of so grim a company. Suppressing\r\nmy fears, I soon discovered that although as hairy as bears and as\r\ncrooked as summit pines, the strange creatures were sufficiently erect\r\nto belong to our own species. They proved to be nothing more formidable\r\nthan Mono Indians dressed in the skins of sage-rabbits. Both the men\r\nand the women begged persistently for whisky and tobacco, and seemed so\r\naccustomed to denials that I found it impossible to convince them that\r\nI had none to give. Excepting the names of these two products of\r\ncivilization, they seemed to understand not a word of English; but I\r\nafterward learned that they were on their way to Yosemite Valley to\r\nfeast awhile on trout and procure a load of acorns to carry back\r\nthrough the pass to their huts on the shore of Mono Lake.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a good countenance may be seen among the Mono Indians, but\r\nthese, the first specimens I had seen, were mostly ugly, and some of\r\nthem altogether hideous. The dirt on their faces was fairly stratified,\r\nand seemed so ancient and so undisturbed it might almost possess a\r\ngeological significance. The older faces were, moreover, strangely\r\nblurred and divided into sections by furrows that looked like the\r\ncleavage-joints of rocks, suggesting exposure on the mountains in a\r\ncastaway condition for ages. Somehow they seemed to have no right place\r\nin the landscape, and I was glad to see them fading out of sight down\r\nthe pass.\r\n\r\nThen came evening, and the somber cliffs were inspired with the\r\nineffable beauty of the alpenglow. A solemn calm fell upon everything.\r\nAll the lower portion of the ca\xc3\xb1on was in gloaming shadow, and I crept\r\ninto a hollow near one of the upper lakelets to smooth the ground in a\r\nsheltered nook for a bed. When the short twilight faded, I kindled a\r\nsunny fire, made a cup of tea, and lay down to rest and look at the\r\nstars. Soon the night-wind began to flow and pour in torrents among the\r\njagged peaks, mingling strange tones with those of the waterfalls\r\nsounding far below; and as I drifted toward sleep I began to experience\r\nan uncomfortable feeling of nearness to the furred Monos. Then the full\r\nmoon looked down over the edge of the ca\xc3\xb1on wall, her countenance\r\nseemingly filled with intense concern, and apparently so near as to\r\nproduce a startling effect as if she had entered my bedroom, forgetting\r\nall the world, to gaze on me alone.\r\n\r\nThe night was full of strange sounds, and I gladly welcomed the\r\nmorning. Breakfast was soon done, and I set forth in the exhilarating\r\nfreshness of the new day, rejoicing in the abundance of pure wildness\r\nso close about me. The stupendous rocks, hacked and scarred with\r\ncenturies of storms, stood sharply out in the thin early light, while\r\ndown in the bottom of the ca\xc3\xb1on grooved and polished bosses heaved and\r\nglistened like swelling sea-waves, telling a grand old story of the\r\nancient glacier that poured its crushing floods above them.\r\n\r\nHere for the first time I met the arctic daisies in all their\r\nperfection of purity and spirituality,\xe2\x80\x94gentle mountaineers face to face\r\nwith the stormy sky, kept safe and warm by a thousand miracles. I\r\nleaped lightly from rock to rock, glorying in the eternal freshness and\r\nsufficiency of Nature, and in the ineffable tenderness with which she\r\nnurtures her mountain darlings in the very fountains of storms. Fresh\r\nbeauty appeared at every step, delicate rock-ferns, and groups of the\r\nfairest flowers. Now another lake came to view, now a waterfall. Never\r\nfell light in brighter spangles, never fell water in whiter foam. I\r\nseemed to float through the ca\xc3\xb1on enchanted, feeling nothing of its\r\nroughness, and was out in the Mono levels before I was aware.\r\n\r\nLooking back from the shore of Moraine Lake, my morning ramble seemed\r\nall a dream. There curved Bloody Ca\xc3\xb1on, a mere glacial furrow 2000 feet\r\ndeep, with smooth rocks projecting from the sides and braided together\r\nin the middle, like bulging, swelling muscles. Here the lilies were\r\nhigher than my head, and the sunshine was warm enough for palms. Yet\r\nthe snow around the arctic willows was plainly visible only four miles\r\naway, and between were narrow specimen zones of all the principal\r\nclimates of the globe.\r\n\r\nOn the bank of a small brook that comes gurgling down the side of the\r\nleft lateral moraine, I found a camp-fire still burning, which no doubt\r\nbelonged to the gray Indians I had met on the summit, and I listened\r\ninstinctively and moved cautiously forward, half expecting to see some\r\nof their grim faces peering out of the bushes.\r\n\r\nPassing on toward the open plain, I noticed three well-defined terminal\r\nmoraines curved gracefully across the ca\xc3\xb1on stream, and joined by long\r\nsplices to the two noble laterals. These mark the halting-places of the\r\nvanished glacier when it was retreating into its summit shadows on the\r\nbreaking-up of the glacial winter.\r\n\r\nFive miles below the foot of Moraine Lake, just where the lateral\r\nmoraines lose themselves in the plain, there was a field of wild rye,\r\ngrowing in magnificent waving bunches six to eight feet high, bearing\r\nheads from six to twelve inches long. Rubbing out some of the grains, I\r\nfound them about five eighths of an inch long, dark-colored, and sweet.\r\nIndian women were gathering it in baskets, bending down large handfuls,\r\nbeating it out, and fanning it in the wind. They were quite\r\npicturesque, coming through the rye, as one caught glimpses of them\r\nhere and there, in winding lanes and openings, with splendid tufts\r\narching above their heads, while their incessant chat and laughter\r\nshowed their heedless joy.\r\n\r\nLike the rye-field, I found the so-called desert of Mono blooming in a\r\nhigh state of natural cultivation with the wild rose, cherry, aster,\r\nand the delicate abronia; also innumerable gilias, phloxes, poppies,\r\nand bush-compositae. I observed their gestures and the various\r\nexpressions of their corollas, inquiring how they could be so fresh and\r\nbeautiful out in this volcanic desert. They told as happy a life as any\r\nplant-company I ever met, and seemed to enjoy even the hot sand and the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nBut the vegetation of the pass has been in great part destroyed, and\r\nthe same may be said of all the more accessible passes throughout the\r\nrange. Immense numbers of starving sheep and cattle have been driven\r\nthrough them into Nevada, trampling the wild gardens and meadows almost\r\nout of existence. The lofty walls are untouched by any foot, and the\r\nfalls sing on unchanged; but the sight of crushed flowers and stripped,\r\nbitten bushes goes far toward destroying the charm of wildness.\r\n\r\nThe ca\xc3\xb1on should be seen in winter. A good, strong traveler, who knows\r\nthe way and the weather, might easily make a safe excursion through it\r\nfrom Yosemite Valley on snow-shoes during some tranquil time, when the\r\nstorms are hushed. The lakes and falls would be buried then; but so,\r\nalso, would be the traces of destructive feet, while the views of the\r\nmountains in their winter garb, and the ride at lightning speed down\r\nthe pass between the snowy walls, would be truly glorious.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF THE MONO PLAIN FROM THE FOOT OF BLOODY CA\xc3\x91ON.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\nTHE GLACIER LAKES\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the many unlooked-for treasures that are bound up and hidden away\r\nin the depths of Sierra solitudes, none more surely charm and surprise\r\nall kinds of travelers than the glacier lakes. The forests and the\r\nglaciers and the snowy fountains of the streams advertise their wealth\r\nin a more or less telling manner even in the distance, but nothing is\r\nseen of the lakes until we have climbed above them. All the upper\r\nbranches of the rivers are fairly laden with lakes, like orchard trees\r\nwith fruit. They lie embosomed in the deep woods, down in the grovy\r\nbottoms of ca\xc3\xb1ons, high on bald tablelands, and around the feet of the\r\nicy peaks, mirroring back their wild beauty over and over again. Some\r\nconception of their lavish abundance may be made from the fact that,\r\nfrom one standpoint on the summit of Red Mountain, a day\xe2\x80\x99s journey to\r\nthe east of Yosemite Valley, no fewer than forty-two are displayed\r\nwithin a radius of ten miles. The whole number in the Sierra can hardly\r\nbe less than fifteen hundred, not counting the smaller pools and tarns,\r\nwhich are innumerable. Perhaps two thirds or more lie on the western\r\nflank of the range, and all are restricted to the alpine and subalpine\r\nregions. At the close of the last glacial period, the middle and\r\nfoot-hill regions also abounded in lakes, all of which have long since\r\nvanished as completely as the magnificent ancient glaciers that brought\r\nthem into existence.\r\n\r\nThough the eastern flank of the range is excessively steep, we find\r\nlakes pretty regularly distributed throughout even the most precipitous\r\nportions. They are mostly found in the upper branches of the ca\xc3\xb1ons,\r\nand in the glacial amphitheaters around the peaks.\r\n\r\nOccasionally long, narrow specimens occur upon the steep sides of\r\ndividing ridges, their basins swung lengthwise like hammocks, and very\r\nrarely one is found lying so exactly on the summit of the range at the\r\nhead of some pass that its waters are discharged down both flanks when\r\nthe snow is melting fast. But, however situated, they soon cease to\r\nform surprises to the studious mountaineer; for, like all the love-work\r\nof Nature, they are harmoniously related to one another, and to all the\r\nother features of the mountains. It is easy, therefore, to find the\r\nbright lake-eyes in the roughest and most ungovernable-looking\r\ntopography of any landscape countenance. Even in the lower regions,\r\nwhere they have been closed for many a century, their rocky orbits are\r\nstill discernible, filled in with the detritus of flood and avalanche.\r\nA beautiful system of grouping in correspondence with the glacial\r\nfountains is soon perceived; also their extension in the direction of\r\nthe trends of the ancient glaciers; and in general their dependence as\r\nto form, size, and position upon the character of the rocks in which\r\ntheir basins have been eroded, and the quantity and direction of\r\napplication of the glacial force expended upon each basin.\r\n\r\nIn the upper ca\xc3\xb1ons we usually find them in pretty regular succession,\r\nstrung together like beads on the bright ribbons of their\r\nfeeding-streams, which pour, white and gray with foam and spray, from\r\none to the other, their perfect mirror stillness making impressive\r\ncontrasts with the grand blare and glare of the connecting cataracts.\r\nIn Lake Hollow, on the north side of the Hoffman spur, immediately\r\nabove the great Tuolumne ca\xc3\xb1on, there are ten lovely lakelets lying\r\nnear together in one general hollow, like eggs in a nest. Seen from\r\nabove, in a general view, feathered with Hemlock Spruce, and fringed\r\nwith sedge, they seem to me the most singularly beautiful and\r\ninterestingly located lake-cluster I have ever yet discovered.\r\n\r\nLake Tahoe, 22 miles long by about 10 wide, and from 500 to over 1600\r\nfeet in depth, is the largest of all the Sierra lakes. It lies just\r\nbeyond the northern limit of the higher portion of the range between\r\nthe main axis and a spur that puts out on the east side from near the\r\nhead of the Carson River. Its forested shores go curving in and out\r\naround many an emerald bay and pine-crowned promontory, and its waters\r\nare everywhere as keenly pure as any to be found among the highest\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nDonner Lake, rendered memorable by the terrible fate of the Donner\r\nparty, is about three miles long, and lies about ten miles to the north\r\nof Tahoe, at the head of one of the tributaries of the Truckee. A few\r\nmiles farther north lies Lake Independence, about the same size as\r\nDonner. But far the greater number of the lakes lie much higher and are\r\nquite small, few of them exceeding a mile in length, most of them less\r\nthan half a mile.\r\n\r\nAlong the lower edge of the lake-belt, the smallest have disappeared by\r\nthe filling-in of their basins, leaving only those of considerable\r\nsize. But all along the upper freshly glaciated margin of the\r\nlake-bearing zone, every hollow, however small, lying within reach of\r\nany portion of the close network of streams, contains a bright,\r\nbrimming pool; so that the landscape viewed from the mountain-tops\r\nseems to be sown broadcast with them. Many of the larger lakes are\r\nencircled with smaller ones like central gems girdled with sparkling\r\nbrilliants. In general, however, there is no marked dividing line as to\r\nsize. In order, therefore, to prevent confusion, I would state here\r\nthat in giving numbers, I include none less than 500 yards in\r\ncircumference.\r\n\r\nIn the basin of the Merced River, I counted 131, of which 111 are upon\r\nthe tributaries that fall so grandly into Yosemite Valley. Pohono\r\nCreek, which forms the fall of that name, takes its rise in a beautiful\r\nlake, lying beneath the shadow of a lofty granite spur that puts out\r\nfrom Buena Vista peak. This is now the only lake left in the whole\r\nPohono Basin. The Illilouette has sixteen, the Nevada no fewer than\r\nsixty-seven, the Tenaya eight, Hoffmann Creek five, and Yosemite Creek\r\nfourteen. There are but two other lake-bearing affluents of the Merced,\r\nviz., the South Fork with fifteen, and Cascade Creek with five, both of\r\nwhich unite with the main trunk below Yosemite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAKE TENAYA, ONE OF THE YOSEMITE FOUNTAINS.]\r\n\r\nThe Merced River, as a whole, is remarkably like an elm-tree, and it\r\nrequires but little effort on the part of the imagination to picture it\r\nstanding upright, with all its lakes hanging upon its spreading\r\nbranches, the topmost eighty miles in height. Now add all the other\r\nlake-bearing rivers of the Sierra, each in its place, and you will have\r\na truly glorious spectacle,\xe2\x80\x94an avenue the length and width of the\r\nrange; the long, slender, gray shafts of the main trunks, the milky way\r\nof arching branches, and the silvery lakes, all clearly defined and\r\nshining on the sky. How excitedly such an addition to the scenery would\r\nbe gazed at! Yet these lakeful rivers are still more excitingly\r\nbeautiful and impressive in their natural positions to those who have\r\nthe eyes to see them as they lie imbedded in their meadows and forests\r\nand glacier-sculptured rocks.\r\n\r\nWhen a mountain lake is born,\xe2\x80\x94when, like a young eye, it first opens to\r\nthe light,\xe2\x80\x94it is an irregular, expressionless crescent, inclosed in\r\nbanks of rock and ice,\xe2\x80\x94bare, glaciated rock on the lower side, the\r\nrugged snout of a glacier on the upper. In this condition it remains\r\nfor many a year, until at length, toward the end of some auspicious\r\ncluster of seasons, the glacier recedes beyond the upper margin of the\r\nbasin, leaving it open from shore to shore for the first time,\r\nthousands of years after its conception beneath the glacier that\r\nexcavated its basin. The landscape, cold and bare, is reflected in its\r\npure depths; the winds ruffle its glassy surface, and the sun fills it\r\nwith throbbing spangles, while its waves begin to lap and murmur around\r\nits leafless shores,\xe2\x80\x94sun-spangles during the day and reflected stars at\r\nnight its only flowers, the winds and the snow its only visitors.\r\nMeanwhile, the glacier continues to recede, and numerous rills, still\r\nyounger than the lake itself, bring down glacier-mud, sand-grains, and\r\npebbles, giving rise to margin-rings and plats of soil. To these fresh\r\nsoil-beds come many a waiting plant. First, a hardy carex with arching\r\nleaves and a spike of brown flowers; then, as the seasons grow warmer,\r\nand the soil-beds deeper and wider, other sedges take their appointed\r\nplaces, and these are joined by blue gentians, daisies, dodecatheons,\r\nviolets, honeyworts, and many a lowly moss. Shrubs also hasten in time\r\nto the new gardens,\xe2\x80\x94kalmia with its glossy leaves and purple flowers,\r\nthe arctic willow, making soft woven carpets, together with the heathy\r\nbryanthus and cassiope, the fairest and dearest of them all. Insects\r\nnow enrich the air, frogs pipe cheerily in the shallows, soon followed\r\nby the ouzel, which is the first bird to visit a glacier lake, as the\r\nsedge is the first of plants.\r\n\r\nSo the young lake grows in beauty, becoming more and more humanly\r\nlovable from century to century. Groves of aspen spring up, and hardy\r\npines, and the Hemlock Spruce, until it is richly overshadowed and\r\nembowered. But while its shores are being enriched, the soil-beds creep\r\nout with incessant growth, contracting its area, while the lighter\r\nmud-particles deposited on the bottom cause it to grow constantly\r\nshallower, until at length the last remnant of the lake\r\nvanishes,\xe2\x80\x94closed forever in ripe and natural old age. And now its\r\nfeeding-stream goes winding on without halting through the new gardens\r\nand groves that have taken its place.\r\n\r\nThe length of the life of any lake depends ordinarily upon the capacity\r\nof its basin, as compared with the carrying power of the streams that\r\nflow into it, the character of the rocks over which these streams flow,\r\nand the relative position of the lake toward other lakes. In a series\r\nwhose basins lie in the same ca\xc3\xb1on, and are fed by one and the same\r\nmain stream, the uppermost will, of course, vanish first unless some\r\nother lake-filling agent comes in to modify the result; because at\r\nfirst it receives nearly all of the sediments that the stream brings\r\ndown, only the finest of the mud-particles being carried through the\r\nhighest of the series to the next below. Then the next higher, and the\r\nnext would be successively filled, and the lowest would be the last to\r\nvanish. But this simplicity as to duration is broken in upon in various\r\nways, chiefly through the action of side-streams that enter the lower\r\nlakes direct. For, notwithstanding many of these side tributaries are\r\nquite short, and, during late summer, feeble, they all become powerful\r\ntorrents in springtime when the snow is melting, and carry not only\r\nsand and pine-needles, but large trunks and boulders tons in weight,\r\nsweeping them down their steeply inclined channels and into the lake\r\nbasins with astounding energy. Many of these side affluents also have\r\nthe advantage of access to the main lateral moraines of the vanished\r\nglacier that occupied the ca\xc3\xb1on, and upon these they draw for\r\nlake-filling material, while the main trunk stream flows mostly over\r\nclean glacier pavements, where but little moraine matter is ever left\r\nfor them to carry. Thus a small rapid stream with abundance of loose\r\ntransportable material within its reach may fill up an extensive basin\r\nin a few centuries, while a large perennial trunk stream, flowing over\r\nclean, enduring pavements, though ordinarily a hundred times larger,\r\nmay not fill a smaller basin in thousands of years.\r\n\r\nThe comparative influence of great and small streams as lake-fillers is\r\nstrikingly illustrated in Yosemite Valley, through which the Merced\r\nflows. The bottom of the valley is now composed of level meadow-lands\r\nand dry, sloping soil-beds planted with oak and pine, but it was once a\r\nlake stretching from wall to wall and nearly from one end of the valley\r\nto the other, forming one of the most beautiful cliff-bound sheets of\r\nwater that ever existed in the Sierra. And though never perhaps seen by\r\nhuman eye, it was but yesterday, geologically speaking, since it\r\ndisappeared, and the traces of its existence are still so fresh, it may\r\neasily be restored to the eye of imagination and viewed in all its\r\ngrandeur, about as truly and vividly as if actually before us. Now we\r\nfind that the detritus which fills this magnificent basin was not\r\nbrought down from the distant mountains by the main streams that\r\nconverge here to form the river, however powerful and available for the\r\npurpose at first sight they appear; but almost wholly by the small\r\nlocal tributaries, such as those of Indian Ca\xc3\xb1on, the Sentinel, and the\r\nThree Brothers, and by a few small residual glaciers which lingered in\r\nthe shadows of the walls long after the main trunk glacier had receded\r\nbeyond the head of the valley.\r\n\r\nHad the glaciers that once covered the range been melted at once,\r\nleaving the entire surface bare from top to bottom simultaneously, then\r\nof course all the lakes would have come into existence at the same\r\ntime, and the highest, other circumstances being equal, would, as we\r\nhave seen, be the first to vanish. But because they melted gradually\r\nfrom the foot of the range upward, the lower lakes were the first to\r\nsee the light and the first to be obliterated. Therefore, instead of\r\nfinding the lakes of the present day at the foot of the range, we find\r\nthem at the top. Most of the lower lakes vanished thousands of years\r\nbefore those now brightening the alpine landscapes were born. And in\r\ngeneral, owing to the deliberation of the upward retreat of the\r\nglaciers, the lowest of the existing lakes are also the oldest, a\r\ngradual transition being apparent throughout the entire belt, from the\r\nolder, forested, meadow-rimmed and contracted forms all the way up to\r\nthose that are new born, lying bare and meadowless among the highest\r\npeaks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DEATH OF A LAKE.]\r\n\r\nA few small lakes unfortunately situated are extinguished suddenly by a\r\nsingle swoop of an avalanche, carrying down immense numbers of trees,\r\ntogether with the soil they were growing upon. Others are obliterated\r\nby land-slips, earthquake taluses, etc., but these lake-deaths compared\r\nwith those resulting from the deliberate and incessant deposition of\r\nsediments, may be termed accidental. Their fate is like that of trees\r\nstruck by lightning.\r\n\r\nThe lake-line is of course still rising, its present elevation being\r\nabout 8000 feet above sea-level; somewhat higher than this toward the\r\nsouthern extremity of the range, lower toward the northern, on account\r\nof the difference in time of the withdrawal of the glaciers, due to\r\ndifference in climate. Specimens occur here and there considerably\r\nbelow this limit, in basins specially protected from inwashing\r\ndetritus, or exceptional in size. These, however, are not sufficiently\r\nnumerous to make any marked irregularity in the line. The highest I\r\nhave yet found lies at an elevation of about 12,000 feet, in a glacier\r\nwomb, at the foot of one of the highest of the summit peaks, a few\r\nmiles to the north of Mount Hitter. The basins of perhaps twenty-five\r\nor thirty are still in process of formation beneath the few lingering\r\nglaciers, but by the time they are born, an equal or greater number\r\nwill probably have died. Since the beginning of the close of the\r\nice-period the whole number in the range has perhaps never been greater\r\nthan at present.\r\n\r\nA rough approximation to the average duration of these mountain lakes\r\nmay be made from data already suggested, but I cannot stop here to\r\npresent the subject in detail. I must also forego, in the mean time,\r\nthe pleasure of a full discussion of the interesting question of\r\nlake-basin formation, for which fine, clear, demonstrative material\r\nabounds in these mountains. In addition to what has been already given\r\non the subject, I will only make this one statement. Every lake in the\r\nSierra is a glacier lake. Their basins were not merely remodeled and\r\nscoured out by this mighty agent, but in the first place were eroded\r\nfrom the solid.\r\n\r\nI must now make haste to give some nearer views of representative\r\nspecimens lying at different elevations on the main lake-belt,\r\nconfining myself to descriptions of the features most characteristic of\r\neach.\r\n\r\nSHADOW LAKE\r\n\r\nThis is a fine specimen of the oldest and lowest of the existing lakes.\r\nIt lies about eight miles above Yosemite Valley, on the main branch of\r\nthe Merced, at an elevation of about 7350 feet above the sea; and is\r\neverywhere so securely cliff-bound that without artificial trails only\r\nwild animals can get down to its rocky shores from any direction. Its\r\noriginal length was about a mile and a half; now it is only half a mile\r\nin length by about a fourth of a mile in width, and over the lowest\r\nportion of the basin ninety-eight feet deep. Its crystal waters are\r\nclasped around on the north and south by majestic granite walls\r\nsculptured in true Yosemitic style into domes, gables, and battlemented\r\nheadlands, which on the south come plunging down sheer into deep water,\r\nfrom a height of from 1500 to 2000 feet. The South Lyell glacier eroded\r\nthis magnificent basin out of solid porphyritic granite while forcing\r\nits way westward from the summit fountains toward Yosemite, and the\r\nexposed rocks around the shores, and the projecting bosses of the\r\nwalls, ground and burnished beneath the vast ice-flood, still glow with\r\nsilvery radiance, notwithstanding the innumerable corroding storms that\r\nhave fallen upon them. The general conformation of the basin, as well\r\nas the moraines laid along the top of the walls, and the grooves and\r\nscratches on the bottom and sides, indicate in the most unmistakable\r\nmanner the direction pursued by this mighty ice-river, its great depth,\r\nand the tremendous energy it exerted in thrusting itself into and out\r\nof the basin; bearing down with superior pressure upon this portion of\r\nits channel, because of the greater declivity, consequently eroding it\r\ndeeper than the other portions about it, and producing the lake-bowl as\r\nthe necessary result.\r\n\r\nWith these magnificent ice-characters so vividly before us it is not\r\neasy to realize that the old glacier that made them vanished tens of\r\ncenturies ago; for, excepting the vegetation that has sprung up, and\r\nthe changes effected by an earthquake that hurled rock-avalanches from\r\nthe weaker headlands, the basin as a whole presents the same appearance\r\nthat it did when first brought to light. The lake itself, however, has\r\nundergone marked changes; one sees at a glance that it is growing old.\r\nMore than two thirds of its original area is now dry land, covered with\r\nmeadow-grasses and groves of pine and fir, and the level bed of\r\nalluvium stretching across from wall to wall at the head is evidently\r\ngrowing out all along its lakeward margin, and will at length close the\r\nlake forever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHADOW LAKE (MERCED LAKE), YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK.]\r\n\r\nEvery lover of fine wildness would delight to saunter on a summer day\r\nthrough the flowery groves now occupying the filled-up portion of the\r\nbasin. The curving shore is clearly traced by a ribbon of white sand\r\nupon which the ripples play; then comes a belt of broad-leafed sedges,\r\ninterrupted here and there by impenetrable tangles of willows; beyond\r\nthis there are groves of trembling aspen; then a dark, shadowy belt of\r\nTwo-leaved Pine, with here and there a round carex meadow ensconced\r\nnest-like in its midst; and lastly, a narrow outer margin of majestic\r\nSilver Fir 200 feet high. The ground beneath the trees is covered with\r\na luxuriant crop of grasses, chiefly triticum, bromus, and\r\ncalamagrostis, with purple spikes and panicles arching to one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulders; while the open meadow patches glow throughout the summer\r\nwith showy flowers,\xe2\x80\x94heleniums, goldenrods, erigerons, lupines,\r\ncastilleias, and lilies, and form favorite hiding and feeding-grounds\r\nfor bears and deer.\r\n\r\nThe rugged south wall is feathered darkly along the top with an\r\nimposing array of spirey Silver Firs, while the rifted precipices all\r\nthe way down to the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge are adorned with picturesque old\r\njunipers, their cinnamon-colored bark showing finely upon the neutral\r\ngray of the granite. These, with a few venturesome Dwarf Pines and\r\nSpruces, lean out over fissured ribs and tablets, or stand erect back\r\nin shadowy niches, in an indescribably wild and fearless manner.\r\nMoreover, the white-flowered Douglas spiraea and dwarf evergreen oak\r\nform graceful fringes along the narrower seams, wherever the slightest\r\nhold can be effected. Rock-ferns, too, are here, such as allosorus,\r\npellaea, and cheilanthes, making handsome rosettes on the drier\r\nfissures; and the delicate maidenhair, cistoperis, and woodsia hide\r\nback in mossy grottoes, moistened by some trickling rill; and then the\r\norange wall-flower holds up its showy panicles here and there in the\r\nsunshine, and bahia makes bosses of gold. But, notwithstanding all this\r\nplant beauty, the general impression in looking across the lake is of\r\nstern, unflinching rockiness; the ferns and flowers are scarcely seen,\r\nand not one fiftieth of the whole surface is screened with plant life.\r\n\r\nThe sunnier north wall is more varied in sculpture, but the general\r\ntone is the same. A few headlands, flat-topped and soil-covered,\r\nsupport clumps of cedar and pine; and up-curving tangles of chinquapin\r\nand live-oak, growing on rough earthquake taluses, girdle their bases.\r\nSmall streams come cascading down between them, their foaming margins\r\nbrightened with gay primulas, gilias, and mimuluses. And close along\r\nthe shore on this side there is a strip of rocky meadow enameled with\r\nbuttercups, daisies, and white violets, and the purple-topped grasses\r\nout on its beveled border dip their leaves into the water.\r\n\r\nThe lower edge of the basin is a dam-like swell of solid granite,\r\nheavily abraded by the old glacier, but scarce at all cut into as yet\r\nby the outflowing stream, though it has flowed on unceasingly since the\r\nlake came into existence.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the stream is fairly over the lake-lip it breaks into\r\ncascades, never for a moment halting, and scarce abating one jot of its\r\nglad energy, until it reaches the next filled-up basin, a mile below.\r\nThen swirling and curving drowsily through meadow and grove, it breaks\r\nforth anew into gray rapids and falls, leaping and gliding in glorious\r\nexuberance of wild bound and dance down into another and yet another\r\nfilled-up lake basin. Then, after a long rest in the levels of Little\r\nYosemite, it makes its grandest display in the famous Nevada Fall. Out\r\nof the clouds of spray at the foot of the fall the battered, roaring\r\nriver gropes its way, makes another mile of cascades and rapids, rests\r\na moment in Emerald Pool, then plunges over the grand cliff of the\r\nVernal Fall, and goes thundering and chafing down a boulder-choked\r\ngorge of tremendous depth and wildness into the tranquil reaches of the\r\nold Yosemite lake basin.\r\n\r\nThe color-beauty about Shadow Lake during the Indian summer is much\r\nricher than one could hope to find in so young and so glacial a\r\nwilderness. Almost every leaf is tinted then, and the golden-rods are\r\nin bloom; but most of the color is given by the ripe grasses, willows,\r\nand aspens. At the foot of the lake you stand in a trembling aspen\r\ngrove, every leaf painted like a butterfly, and away to right and left\r\nround the shores sweeps a curving ribbon of meadow, red and brown\r\ndotted with pale yellow, shading off here and there into hazy purple.\r\nThe walls, too, are dashed with bits of bright color that gleam out on\r\nthe neutral granite gray. But neither the walls, nor the margin meadow,\r\nnor yet the gay, fluttering grove in which you stand, nor the lake\r\nitself, flashing with spangles, can long hold your attention; for at\r\nthe head of the lake there is a gorgeous mass of orange-yellow,\r\nbelonging to the main aspen belt of the basin, which seems the very\r\nfountain whence all the color below it had flowed, and here your eye is\r\nfilled and fixed. This glorious mass is about thirty feet high, and\r\nextends across the basin nearly from wall to wall. Rich bosses of\r\nwillow flame in front of it, and from the base of these the brown\r\nmeadow comes forward to the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge, the whole being relieved\r\nagainst the unyielding green of the coniferae, while thick sun-gold is\r\npoured over all.\r\n\r\nDuring these blessed color-days no cloud darkens the sky, the winds are\r\ngentle, and the landscape rests, hushed everywhere, and indescribably\r\nimpressive. A few ducks are usually seen sailing on the lake,\r\napparently more for pleasure than anything else, and the ouzels at the\r\nhead of the rapids sing always; while robins, grosbeaks, and the\r\nDouglas squirrels are busy in the groves, making delightful company,\r\nand intensifying the feeling of grateful sequestration without ruffling\r\nthe deep, hushed calm and peace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VERNAL FALL, YOSEMITE VALLEY]\r\n\r\nThis autumnal mellowness usually lasts until the end of November. Then\r\ncome days of quite another kind. The winter clouds grow, and bloom, and\r\nshed their starry crystals on every leaf and rock, and all the colors\r\nvanish like a sunset. The deer gather and hasten down their well-known\r\ntrails, fearful of being snow-bound. Storm succeeds storm, heaping snow\r\non the cliffs and meadows, and bending the slender pines to the ground\r\nin wide arches, one over the other, clustering and interlacing like\r\nlodged wheat. Avalanches rush and boom from the shelving heights,\r\npiling immense heaps upon the frozen lake, and all the summer glory is\r\nburied and lost. Yet in the midst of this hearty winter the sun shines\r\nwarm at times, calling the Douglas squirrel to frisk in the snowy pines\r\nand seek out his hidden stores; and the weather is never so severe as\r\nto drive away the grouse and little nut-hatches and chickadees.\r\n\r\nToward May, the lake begins to open. The hot sun sends down innumerable\r\nstreams over the cliffs, streaking them round and round with foam. The\r\nsnow slowly vanishes, and the meadows show tintings of green. Then\r\nspring comes on apace; flowers and flies enrich the air and the sod,\r\nand the deer come back to the upper groves like birds to an old nest.\r\n\r\nI first discovered this charming lake in the autumn of 1872, while on\r\nmy way to the glaciers at the head of the river. It was rejoicing then\r\nin its gayest colors, untrodden, hidden in the glorious wildness like\r\nunmined gold. Year after year I walked its shores without discovering\r\nany other trace of humanity than the remains of an Indian camp-fire,\r\nand the thigh-bones of a deer that had been broken to get at the\r\nmarrow. It lies out of the regular ways of Indians, who love to hunt in\r\nmore accessible fields adjacent to trails. Their knowledge of\r\ndeer-haunts had probably enticed them here some hunger-time when they\r\nwished to make sure of a feast; for hunting in this lake-hollow is like\r\nhunting in a fenced park. I had told the beauty of Shadow Lake only to\r\na few friends, fearing it might come to be trampled and \xe2\x80\x9cimproved\xe2\x80\x9d like\r\nYosemite. On my last visit, as I was sauntering along the shore on the\r\nstrip of sand between the water and sod, reading the tracks of the wild\r\nanimals that live here, I was startled by a human track, which I at\r\nonce saw belonged to some shepherd; for each step was turned out 35\xc2\xb0 or\r\n40\xc2\xb0 from the general course pursued, and was also run over in an\r\nuncertain sprawling fashion at the heel, while a row of round dots on\r\nthe right indicated the staff that shepherds carry. None but a shepherd\r\ncould make such a track, and after tracing it a few minutes I began to\r\nfear that he might be seeking pasturage; for what else could he be\r\nseeking? Returning from the glaciers shortly afterward, nay worst fears\r\nwere realized. A trail had been made down the mountain-side from the\r\nnorth, and all the gardens and meadows were destroyed by a horde of\r\nhoofed locusts, as if swept by a fire. The money-changers were in the\r\ntemple.\r\n\r\nORANGE LAKE\r\n\r\nBesides these larger ca\xc3\xb1on lakes, fed by the main ca\xc3\xb1on streams, there\r\nare many smaller ones lying aloft on the top of rock benches, entirely\r\nindependent of the general drainage channels, and of course drawing\r\ntheir supplies from a very limited area. Notwithstanding they are\r\nmostly small and shallow, owing to their immunity from avalanche\r\ndetritus and the inwashings of powerful streams, they often endure\r\nlonger than others many times larger but less favorably situated. When\r\nvery shallow they become dry toward the end of summer; but because\r\ntheir basins are ground out of seamless stone they suffer no loss save\r\nfrom evaporation alone; and the great depth of snow that falls, lasting\r\ninto June, makes their dry season short in any case.\r\n\r\nOrange Lake is a fair illustration of this bench form. It lies in the\r\nmiddle of a beautiful glacial pavement near the lower margin of the\r\nlake-line, about a mile and a half to the northwest of Shadow Lake. It\r\nis only about 100 yards in circumference. Next the water there is a\r\ngirdle of carices with wide overarching leaves, then in regular order a\r\nshaggy ruff of huckleberry bushes, a zone of willows with here and\r\nthere a bush of the Mountain Ash, then a zone of aspens with a few\r\npines around the outside. These zones are of course concentric, and\r\ntogether form a wall beyond which the naked ice-burnished granite\r\nstretches away in every direction, leaving it conspicuously relieved,\r\nlike a bunch of palms in a desert.\r\n\r\nIn autumn, when the colors are ripe, the whole circular grove, at a\r\nlittle distance, looks like a big handful of flowers set in a cup to be\r\nkept fresh\xe2\x80\x94a tuft of goldenrods. Its feeding-streams are exceedingly\r\nbeautiful, notwithstanding their inconstancy and extreme shallowness.\r\nThey have no channel whatever, and consequently are left free to spread\r\nin thin sheets upon the shining granite and wander at will. In many\r\nplaces the current is less than a fourth of an inch deep, and flows\r\nwith so little friction it is scarcely visible. Sometimes there is not\r\na single foam-bell, or drifting pine-needle, or irregularity of any\r\nsort to manifest its motion. Yet when observed narrowly it is seen to\r\nform a web of gliding lacework exquisitely woven, giving beautiful\r\nreflections from its minute curving ripples and eddies, and differing\r\nfrom the water-laces of large cascades in being everywhere transparent.\r\nIn spring, when the snow is melting, the lake-bowl is brimming full,\r\nand sends forth quite a large stream that slips glassily for 200 yards\r\nor so, until it comes to an almost vertical precipice 800 feet high,\r\ndown which it plunges in a fine cataract; then it gathers its scattered\r\nwaters and goes smoothly over folds of gently dipping granite to its\r\nconfluence with the main ca\xc3\xb1on stream. During the greater portion of\r\nthe year, however, not a single water sound will you hear either at\r\nhead or foot of the lake, not oven the whispered lappings of\r\nripple-waves along the shore; for the winds are fenced out. But the\r\ndeep mountain silence is sweetened now and then by birds that stop here\r\nto rest and drink on their way across the ca\xc3\xb1on.\r\n\r\nLAKE STARR KING\r\n\r\nA beautiful variety of the bench-top lakes occurs just where the great\r\nlateral moraines of the main glaciers have been shoved forward in\r\noutswelling concentric rings by small residual tributary glaciers.\r\nInstead of being encompassed by a narrow ring of trees like Orange\r\nLake, these lie embosomed in dense moraine woods, so dense that in\r\nseeking them you may pass them by again and again, although you may\r\nknow nearly where they lie concealed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAKE STARR KING.]\r\n\r\nLake Starr King, lying to the north of the cone of that name, above the\r\nLittle Yosemite Valley, is a fine specimen of this variety. The ouzels\r\npass it by, and so do the ducks; they could hardly get into it if they\r\nwould, without plumping straight down inside the circling trees.\r\n\r\nYet these isolated gems, lying like fallen fruit detached from the\r\nbranches, are not altogether without inhabitants and joyous, animating\r\nvisitors. Of course fishes cannot get into them, and this is generally\r\ntrue of nearly every glacier lake in the range, but they are all well\r\nstocked with happy frogs. How did the frogs get into them in the first\r\nplace? Perhaps their sticky spawn was carried in on the feet of ducks\r\nor other birds, else their progenitors must have made some exciting\r\nexcursions through the woods and up the sides of the ca\xc3\xb1ons. Down in\r\nthe still, pure depths of these hidden lakelets you may also find the\r\nlarvae of innumerable insects and a great variety of beetles, while the\r\nair above them is thick with humming wings, through the midst of which\r\nfly-catchers are constantly darting. And in autumn, when the\r\nhuckleberries are ripe, bands of robins and grosbeaks come to feast,\r\nforming altogether delightful little byworlds for the naturalist.\r\n\r\nPushing our way upward toward the axis of the range, we find lakes in\r\ngreater and greater abundance, and more youthful in aspect. At an\r\nelevation of about 9000 feet above sea-level they seem to have arrived\r\nat middle age,\xe2\x80\x94that is, their basins seem to be about half filled with\r\nalluvium. Broad sheets of meadow-land are seen extending into them,\r\nimperfect and boggy in many places and more nearly level than those of\r\nthe older lakes below them, and the vegetation of their shores is of\r\ncourse more alpine. Kalmia, lodum, and cassiope fringe the meadow\r\nrocks, while the luxuriant, waving groves, so characteristic of the\r\nlower lakes, are represented only by clumps of the Dwarf Pine and\r\nHemlock Spruce. These, however, are oftentimes very picturesquely\r\ngrouped on rocky headlands around the outer rim of the meadows, or with\r\nstill more striking effect crown some rocky islet.\r\n\r\nMoreover, from causes that we cannot stop here to explain, the cliffs\r\nabout these middle-aged lakes are seldom of the massive Yosemite type,\r\nbut are more broken, and less sheer, and they usually stand back,\r\nleaving the shores comparatively free; while the few precipitous rocks\r\nthat do come forward and plunge directly into deep water are seldom\r\nmore than three or four hundred feet high.\r\n\r\nI have never yet met ducks in any of the lakes of this kind, but the\r\nouzel is never wanting where the feeding-streams are perennial. Wild\r\nsheep and deer may occasionally be seen on the meadows, and very rarely\r\na bear. One might camp on the rugged shores of these bright fountains\r\nfor weeks, without meeting any animal larger than the marmots that\r\nburrow beneath glacier boulders along the edges of the meadows.\r\n\r\nThe highest and youngest of all the lakes lie nestled in glacier wombs.\r\nAt first sight, they seem pictures of pure bloodless desolation,\r\nminiature arctic seas, bound in perpetual ice and snow, and\r\novershadowed by harsh, gloomy, crumbling precipices. Their waters are\r\nkeen ultramarine blue in the deepest parts, lively grass-green toward\r\nthe shore shallows and around the edges of the small bergs usually\r\nfloating about in them. A few hardy sedges, frost-pinched every night,\r\nare occasionally found making soft sods along the sun-touched portions\r\nof their shores, and when their northern banks slope openly to the\r\nsouth, and are soil-covered, no matter how coarsely, they are sure to\r\nbe brightened with flowers. One lake in particular now comes to mind\r\nwhich illustrates the floweriness of the sun-touched banks of these icy\r\ngems. Close up under the shadow of the Sierra Matterhorn, on the\r\neastern slope of the range, lies one of the iciest of these glacier\r\nlakes at an elevation of about 12,000 feet. A short, ragged-edged\r\nglacier crawls into it from the south, and on the opposite side it is\r\nembanked and dammed by a series of concentric terminal moraines, made\r\nby the glacier when it entirely filled the basin. Half a mile below\r\nlies a second lake, at a height of 11,500 feet, about as cold and as\r\npure as a snow-crystal. The waters of the first come gurgling down into\r\nit over and through the moraine dam, while a second stream pours into\r\nit direct from a glacier that lies to the southeast. Sheer precipices\r\nof crystalline snow rise out of deep water on the south, keeping\r\nperpetual winter on that side, but there is a fine summery spot on the\r\nother, notwithstanding the lake is only about 300 yards wide. Here, on\r\nAugust 25, 1873, I found a charming company of flowers, not pinched,\r\ncrouching dwarfs, scarce able to look up, but warm and juicy, standing\r\nerect in rich cheery color and bloom. On a narrow strip of shingle,\r\nclose to the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge, there were a few tufts of carex gone to\r\nseed; and a little way back up the rocky bank at the foot of a\r\ncrumbling wall so inclined as to absorb and radiate as well as reflect\r\na considerable quantity of sun-heat, was the garden, containing a\r\nthrifty thicket of Cowania covered with large yellow flowers; several\r\nbushes of the alpine ribes with berries nearly ripe and wildly acid; a\r\nfew handsome grasses belonging to two distinct species, and one\r\ngoldenrod; a few hairy lupines and radiant spragueas, whose blue and\r\nrose-colored flowers were set off to fine advantage amid green carices;\r\nand along a narrow seam in the very warmest angle of the wall a\r\nperfectly gorgeous fringe of _Epilobium obcordatum_ with flowers an\r\ninch wide, crowded together in lavish profusion, and colored as royal a\r\npurple as ever was worn by any high-bred plant of the tropics; and best\r\nof all, and greatest of all, a noble thistle in full bloom, standing\r\nerect, head and shoulders above his companions, and thrusting out his\r\nlances in sturdy vigor as if growing on a Scottish brae. All this brave\r\nwarm bloom among the raw stones, right in the face of the onlooking\r\nglaciers.\r\n\r\nAs far as I have been able to find out, these upper lakes are\r\nsnow-buried in winter to a depth of about thirty-five or forty feet,\r\nand those most exposed to avalanches, to a depth of even a hundred feet\r\nor more. These last are, of course, nearly lost to the landscape. Some\r\nremain buried for years, when the snowfall is exceptionally great, and\r\nmany open only on one side late in the season. The snow of the closed\r\nside is composed of coarse granules compacted and frozen into a firm,\r\nfaintly stratified mass, like the _n\xc3\xa9v\xc3\xa9_ of a glacier. The lapping\r\nwaves of the open portion gradually undermine and cause it to break off\r\nin large masses like icebergs, which gives rise to a precipitous front\r\nlike the discharging wall of a glacier entering the sea. The play of\r\nthe lights among the crystal angles of these snow-cliffs, the pearly\r\nwhite of the outswelling bosses, the bergs drifting in front, aglow in\r\nthe sun and edged with green water, and the deep blue disk of the lake\r\nitself extending to your feet,\xe2\x80\x94this forms a picture that enriches all\r\nyour afterlife, and is never forgotten. But however perfect the season\r\nand the day, the cold incompleteness of these young lakes is always\r\nkeenly felt. We approach them with a kind of mean caution, and steal\r\nunconfidingly around their crystal shores, dashed and ill at ease, as\r\nif expecting to hear some forbidding voice. But the love-songs of the\r\nouzels and the love-looks of the daisies gradually reassure us, and\r\nmanifest the warm fountain humanity that pervades the coldest and most\r\nsolitary of them all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\nTHE GLACIER MEADOWS\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the lakes on the High Sierra come the glacier meadows. They are\r\nsmooth, level, silky lawns, lying embedded in the upper forests, on the\r\nfloors of the valleys, and along the broad backs of the main dividing\r\nridges, at a height of about 8000 to 9500 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nThey are nearly as level as the lakes whose places they have taken, and\r\npresent a dry, even surface free from rock-heaps, mossy bogginess, and\r\nthe frowsy roughness of rank, coarse-leaved, weedy, and shrubby\r\nvegetation. The sod is close and fine, and so complete that you cannot\r\nsee the ground; and at the same time so brightly enameled with flowers\r\nand butterflies that it may well be called a garden-meadow, or\r\nmeadow-garden; for the plushy sod is in many places so crowded with\r\ngentians, daisies, ivesias, and various species of orthocarpus that the\r\ngrass is scarcely noticeable, while in others the flowers are only\r\npricked in here and there singly, or in small ornamental rosettes.\r\n\r\nThe most influential of the grasses composing the sod is a delicate\r\ncalamagrostis with fine filiform leaves, and loose, airy panicles that\r\nseem to float above the flowery lawn like a purple mist. But, write as\r\nI may, I cannot give anything like an adequate idea of the exquisite\r\nbeauty of these mountain carpets as they lie smoothly outspread in the\r\nsavage wilderness. What words are fine enough to picture them I to what\r\nshall we liken them? The flowery levels of the prairies of the old\r\nWest, the luxuriant savannahs of the South, and the finest of\r\ncultivated meadows are coarse in comparison. One may at first sight\r\ncompare them with the carefully tended lawns of pleasure-grounds; for\r\nthey are as free from weeds as they, and as smooth, but here the\r\nlikeness ends; for these wild lawns, with all their exquisite fineness,\r\nhave no trace of that painful, licked, snipped, repressed appearance\r\nthat pleasure-ground lawns are apt to have even when viewed at a\r\ndistance. And, not to mention the flowers with which they are\r\nbrightened, their grasses are very much finer both in color and\r\ntexture, and instead of lying flat and motionless, matted together like\r\na dead green cloth, they respond to the touches of every breeze,\r\nrejoicing in pure wildness, blooming and fruiting in the vital light.\r\n\r\nGlacier meadows abound throughout all the alpine and subalpine regions\r\nof the Sierra in still greater numbers than the lakes. Probably from\r\n2500 to 3000 exist between latitude 36\xc2\xb0 30\xe2\x80\xb2 and 39\xc2\xb0, distributed, of\r\ncourse, like the lakes, in concordance with all the other glacial\r\nfeatures of the landscape.\r\n\r\nOn the head waters of the rivers there are what are called \xe2\x80\x9cBig\r\nMeadows,\xe2\x80\x9d usually about from five to ten miles long. These occupy the\r\nbasins of the ancient ice-seas, where many tributary glaciers came\r\ntogether to form the grand trunks. Most, however, are quite small,\r\naveraging perhaps but little more than three fourths of a mile in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nOne of the very finest of the thousands I have enjoyed lies hidden in\r\nan extensive forest of the Two-leaved Pine, on the edge of the basin of\r\nthe ancient Tuolumne Mer de Glace, about eight miles to the west of\r\nMount Dana.\r\n\r\nImagine yourself at the Tuolumne Soda Springs on the bank of the river,\r\na day\xe2\x80\x99s journey above Yosemite Valley. You set off northward through a\r\nforest that stretches away indefinitely before you, seemingly unbroken\r\nby openings of any kind. As soon as you are fairly into the woods, the\r\ngray mountain-peaks, with their snowy gorges and hollows, are lost to\r\nview. The ground is littered with fallen trunks that lie crossed and\r\nrecrossed like storm-lodged wheat; and besides this close forest of\r\npines, the rich moraine soil supports a luxuriant growth of\r\nribbon-leaved grasses\xe2\x80\x94bromus, triticum, calamagrostis, agrostis, etc.,\r\nwhich rear their handsome spikes and panicles above your waist. Making\r\nyour way through the fertile wilderness,\xe2\x80\x94finding lively bits of\r\ninterest now and then in the squirrels and Clark crows, and perchance\r\nin a deer or bear,\xe2\x80\x94after the lapse of an hour or two vertical bars of\r\nsunshine are seen ahead between the brown shafts of the pines, showing\r\nthat you are approaching an open space, and then you suddenly emerge\r\nfrom the forest shadows upon a delightful purple lawn lying smooth and\r\nfree in the light like a lake. This is a glacier meadow. It is about a\r\nmile and a half long by a quarter of a mile wide. The trees come\r\npressing forward all around in close serried ranks, planting their feet\r\nexactly on its margin, and holding themselves erect, strict and orderly\r\nlike soldiers on parade; thus bounding the meadow with exquisite\r\nprecision, yet with free curving lines such as Nature alone can draw.\r\nWith inexpressible delight you wade out into the grassy sun-lake,\r\nfeeling yourself contained in one of Nature\xe2\x80\x99s most sacred chambers,\r\nwithdrawn from the sterner influences of the mountains, secure from all\r\nintrusion, secure from yourself, free in the universal beauty. And\r\nnotwithstanding the scene is so impressively spiritual, and you seem\r\ndissolved in it, yet everything about you is beating with warm,\r\nterrestrial, human love and life delightfully substantial and familiar.\r\nThe resiny pines are types of health and steadfastness; the robins\r\nfeeding on the sod belong to the same species you have known since\r\nchildhood; and surely these daisies, larkspurs, and goldenrods are the\r\nvery friend-flowers of the old home garden. Bees hum as in a harvest\r\nnoon, butterflies waver above the flowers, and like them you lave in\r\nthe vital sunshine, too richly and homogeneously joy-filled to be\r\ncapable of partial thought. You are all eye, sifted through and through\r\nwith light and beauty. Sauntering along the brook that meanders\r\nsilently through the meadow from the east, special flowers call you\r\nback to discriminating consciousness. The sod comes curving down to the\r\nwater\xe2\x80\x99s edge, forming bossy outswelling banks, and in some places\r\noverlapping countersunk boulders and forming bridges. Here you find\r\nmats of the curious dwarf willow scarce an inch high, yet sending up a\r\nmultitude of gray silky catkins, illumined here and there with, the\r\npurple cups and bells of bryanthus and vaccinium.\r\n\r\nGo where you may, you everywhere find the lawn divinely beautiful, as\r\nif Nature had fingered and adjusted every plant this very day. The\r\nfloating grass panicles are scarcely felt in brushing through their\r\nmidst, so flue are they, and none of the flowers have tall or rigid\r\nstalks. In the brightest places you find three species of gentians with\r\ndifferent shades of blue, daisies pure as the sky, silky leaved ivesias\r\nwith warm yellow flowers, several species of orthocarpus with blunt,\r\nbossy spikes, red and purple and yellow; the alpine goldenrod,\r\npentstemon, and clover, fragrant and honeyful, with their colors massed\r\nand blended. Parting the grasses and looking more closely you may trace\r\nthe branching of their shining stems, and note the marvelous beauty of\r\ntheir mist of flowers, the glumes and pales exquisitely penciled, the\r\nyellow dangling stamens, and feathery pistils. Beneath the lowest\r\nleaves you discover a fairy realm of mosses,\xe2\x80\x94hypnum, dicranum,\r\npolytriclium, and many others,\xe2\x80\x94their precious spore-cups poised\r\ndaintily on polished shafts, curiously hooded, or open, showing the\r\nrichly ornate peristomas worn like royal crowns. Creeping liverworts\r\nare here also in abundance, and several rare species of fungi,\r\nexceedingly small, and frail, and delicate, as if made only for beauty.\r\nCaterpillars, black beetles, and ants roam the wilds of this lower\r\nworld, making their way through miniature groves and thickets like\r\nbears in a thick wood.\r\n\r\nAnd how rich, too, is the life of the sunny air! Every leaf and flower\r\nseems to have its winged representative overhead. Dragon-flies shoot in\r\nvigorous zigzags through the dancing swarms, and a rich profusion of\r\nbutterflies\xe2\x80\x94the leguminosae of insects\xe2\x80\x94make a fine addition to the\r\ngeneral show. Many of these last are comparatively small at this\r\nelevation, and as yet almost unknown to science; but every now and then\r\na familiar vanessa or papilio comes sailing past. Humming-birds, too,\r\nare quite common here, and the robin is always found along the margin\r\nof the stream, or out in the shallowest portions of the sod, and\r\nsometimes the grouse and mountain quail, with their broods of precious\r\nfluffy chickens. Swallows skim the grassy lake from end to end,\r\nfly-catchers come and go in fitful flights from the tops of dead spars,\r\nwhile woodpeckers swing across from side to side in graceful festoon\r\ncurves,\xe2\x80\x94birds, insects, and flowers all in their own way telling a deep\r\nsummer joy.\r\n\r\nThe influences of pure nature seem to be so little known as yet, that\r\nit is generally supposed that complete pleasure of this kind,\r\npermeating one\xe2\x80\x99s very flesh and bones, unfits the student for\r\nscientific pursuits in which cool judgment and observation are\r\nrequired. But the effect is just the opposite. Instead of producing a\r\ndissipated condition, the mind is fertilized and stimulated and\r\ndeveloped like sun-fed plants. All that we have seen here enables us to\r\nsee with surer vision the fountains among the summit-peaks to the east\r\nwhence flowed the glaciers that ground soil for the surrounding forest;\r\nand down at the foot of the meadow the moraine which formed the dam\r\nwhich gave rise to the lake that occupied this basin before the meadow\r\nwas made; and around the margin the stones that were shoved back and\r\npiled up into a rude wall by the expansion of the lake ice during long\r\nbygone winters; and along the sides of the streams the slight hollows\r\nof the meadow which mark those portions of the old lake that were the\r\nlast to vanish.\r\n\r\nI would fain ask my readers to linger awhile in this fertile\r\nwilderness, to trace its history from its earliest glacial beginnings,\r\nand learn what we may of its wild inhabitants and visitors. How happy\r\nthe birds are all summer and some of them all winter; how the pouched\r\nmarmots drive tunnels under the snow, and how fine and brave a life the\r\nslandered coyote lives here, and the deer and bears! But, knowing well\r\nthe difference between reading and seeing, I will only ask attention to\r\nsome brief sketches of its varying aspects as they are presented\r\nthroughout the more marked seasons of the year.\r\n\r\nThe summer life we have been depicting lasts with but little abatement\r\nuntil October, when the night frosts begin to sting, bronzing the\r\ngrasses, and ripening the leaves of the creeping heathworts along the\r\nbanks of the stream to reddish purple and crimson; while the flowers\r\ndisappear, all save the goldenrods and a few daisies, that continue to\r\nbloom on unscathed until the beginning of snowy winter. In still nights\r\nthe grass panicles and every leaf and stalk are laden with frost\r\ncrystals, through which the morning sunbeams sift in ravishing\r\nsplendor, transforming each to a precious diamond radiating the colors\r\nof the rainbow. The brook shallows are plaited across and across with\r\nslender lances of ice, but both these and the grass crystals are melted\r\nbefore midday, and, notwithstanding the great elevation of the meadow,\r\nthe afternoons are still warm enough to revive the chilled butterflies\r\nand call them out to enjoy the late-flowering goldenrods. The divine\r\nalpenglow flushes the surrounding forest every evening, followed by a\r\ncrystal night with hosts of lily stars, whose size and brilliancy\r\ncannot be conceived by those who have never risen above the lowlands.\r\n\r\nThus come and go the bright sun-days of autumn, not a cloud in the sky,\r\nweek after week until near December. Then comes a sudden change. Clouds\r\nof a peculiar aspect with a slow, crawling gait gather and grow in the\r\nazure, throwing out satiny fringes, and becoming gradually darker until\r\nevery lake-like rift and opening is closed and the whole bent firmament\r\nis obscured in equal structureless gloom. Then comes the snow, for the\r\nclouds are ripe, the meadows of the sky are in bloom, and shed their\r\nradiant blossoms like an orchard in the spring. Lightly, lightly they\r\nlodge in the brown grasses and in the tasseled needles of the pines,\r\nfalling hour after hour, day after day, silently, lovingly,\xe2\x80\x94all the\r\nwinds hushed,\xe2\x80\x94glancing and circling hither, thither, glinting against\r\none another, rays interlocking in flakes as large as daisies; and then\r\nthe dry grasses, and the trees, and the stones are all equally abloom\r\nagain. Thunder-showers occur here during the summer months, and\r\nimpressive it is to watch the coming of the big transparent drops, each\r\na small world in itself,\xe2\x80\x94one unbroken ocean without islands hurling\r\nfree through the air like planets through space. But still more\r\nimpressive to me is the coming of the snow-flowers,\xe2\x80\x94falling stars,\r\nwinter daisies,\xe2\x80\x94giving bloom to all the ground alike. Raindrops blossom\r\nbrilliantly in the rainbow, and change to flowers in the sod, but snow\r\ncomes in full flower direct from the dark, frozen sky.\r\n\r\nThe later snow-storms are oftentimes accompanied by winds that break up\r\nthe crystals, when the temperature is low, into single petals and\r\nirregular dusty fragments; but there is comparatively little drifting\r\non the meadow, so securely is it embosomed in the woods. From December\r\nto May, storm succeeds storm, until the snow is about fifteen or twenty\r\nfeet deep, but the surface is always as smooth as the breast of a bird.\r\n\r\nHushed now is the life that so late was beating warmly. Most of the\r\nbirds have gone down below the snow-line, the plants sleep, and all the\r\nfly-wings are folded. Yet the sun beams gloriously many a cloudless day\r\nin midwinter, casting long lance shadows athwart the dazzling expanse.\r\nIn June small flecks of the dead, decaying sod begin to appear,\r\ngradually widening and uniting with one another, covered with creeping\r\nrags of water during the day, and ice by night, looking as hopeless and\r\nunvital as crushed rocks just emerging from the darkness of the glacial\r\nperiod. Walk the meadow now! Scarce the memory of a flower will you\r\nfind. The ground seems twice dead. Nevertheless, the annual\r\nresurrection is drawing near. The life-giving sun pours his floods, the\r\nlast snow-wreath melts, myriads of growing points push eagerly through\r\nthe steaming mold, the birds come back, new wings fill the air, and\r\nfervid summer life comes surging on, seemingly yet more glorious than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThis is a perfect meadow, and under favorable circumstances exists\r\nwithout manifesting any marked changes for centuries. Nevertheless,\r\nsoon or late it must inevitably grow old and vanish. During the calm\r\nIndian summer, scarce a sand-grain moves around its banks, but in\r\nflood-times and storm-times, soil is washed forward upon it and laid in\r\nsuccessive sheets around its gently sloping rim, and is gradually\r\nextended to the center, making it dryer. Through a considerable period\r\nthe meadow vegetation is not greatly affected thereby, for it gradually\r\nrises with the rising ground, keeping on the surface like water-plants\r\nrising on the swell of waves. But at length the elevation of the\r\nmeadow-land goes on so far as to produce too dry a soil for the\r\nspecific meadow-plants, when, of course, they have to give up their\r\nplaces to others fitted for the new conditions. The most characteristic\r\nof the newcomers at this elevation above the sea are principally\r\nsun-loving gilias, eriogonae, and compositae, and finally forest-trees.\r\nHenceforward the obscuring changes are so manifold that the original\r\nlake-meadow can be unveiled and seen only by the geologist.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, glacier lakes vanish more slowly than the meadows\r\nthat succeed them, because, unless very shallow, a greater quantity of\r\nmaterial is required to fill up their basins and obliterate them than\r\nis required to render the surface of the meadow too high and dry for\r\nmeadow vegetation. Furthermore, owing to the weathering to which the\r\nadjacent rocks are subjected, material of the finer sort, susceptible\r\nof transportation by rains and ordinary floods, is more abundant during\r\nthe meadow period than during the lake period. Yet doubtless many a\r\nfine meadow favorably situated exists in almost prime beauty for\r\nthousands of years, the process of extinction being exceedingly slow,\r\nas we reckon time. This is especially the case with meadows\r\ncircumstanced like the one we have described\xe2\x80\x94embosomed in deep woods,\r\nwith the ground rising gently away from it all around, the network of\r\ntree-roots in which all the ground is clasped preventing any rapid\r\ntorrential washing. But, in exceptional cases, beautiful lawns formed\r\nwith great deliberation are overwhelmed and obliterated at once by the\r\naction of land-slips, earthquake avalanches, or extraordinary floods,\r\njust as lakes are.\r\n\r\nIn those glacier meadows that take the places of shallow lakes which\r\nhave been fed by feeble streams, glacier mud and fine vegetable humus\r\nenter largely into the composition of the soil; and on account of the\r\nshallowness of this soil, and the seamless, water-tight, undrained\r\ncondition of the rock-basins, they are usually wet, and therefore\r\noccupied by tall grasses and sedges, whose coarse appearance offers a\r\nstriking contrast to that of the delicate lawn-making kind described\r\nabove. These shallow-soiled meadows are oftentimes still further\r\nroughened and diversified by partially buried moraines and swelling\r\nbosses of the bed-rock, which, with the trees and shrubs growing upon\r\nthem, produce a striking effect as they stand in relief like islands in\r\nthe grassy level, or sweep across in rugged curves from one forest wall\r\nto the other.\r\n\r\nThroughout the upper meadow region, wherever water is sufficiently\r\nabundant and low in temperature, in basins secure from flood-washing,\r\nhandsome bogs are formed with a deep growth of brown and yellow\r\nsphagnum picturesquely ruined with patches of kalmia and ledum which\r\nripen masses of beautiful color in the autumn. Between these cool,\r\nspongy bogs and the dry, flowery meadows there are many interesting\r\nvarieties which are graduated into one another by the varied conditions\r\nalready alluded to, forming a series of delightful studies.\r\n\r\nHANGING MEADOWS\r\n\r\nAnother, very well-marked and interesting kind of meadow, differing\r\ngreatly both in origin and appearance from the lake-meadows, is found\r\nlying aslant upon moraine-covered hillsides trending in the direction\r\nof greatest declivity, waving up and down over rock heaps and ledges,\r\nlike rich green ribbons brilliantly illumined with tall flowers. They\r\noccur both in the alpine and subalpine regions in considerable numbers,\r\nand never fail to make telling features in the landscape. They are\r\noften a mile or more in length, but never very wide\xe2\x80\x94usually from thirty\r\nto fifty yards. When the mountain or ca\xc3\xb1on side on which, they lie dips\r\nat the required angle, and other conditions are at the same time\r\nfavorable, they extend from above the timber line to the bottom of a\r\nca\xc3\xb1on or lake basin, descending in fine, fluent lines like cascades,\r\nbreaking here and there into a kind of spray on large boulders, or\r\ndividing and flowing around on either side of some projecting islet.\r\nSometimes a noisy stream goes brawling down through them, and again,\r\nscarcely a drop of water is in sight. They owe their existence,\r\nhowever, to streams, whether visible or invisible, the wildest\r\nspecimens being found where some perennial fountain, as a glacier or\r\nsnowbank or moraine spring sends down its waters across a rough sheet\r\nof soil in a dissipated web of feeble, oozing rivulets. These\r\nconditions give rise to a meadowy vegetation, whose extending roots\r\nstill more obstruct the free flow of the waters, and tend to dissipate\r\nthem out over a yet wider area. Thus the moraine soil and the necessary\r\nmoisture requisite for the better class of meadow plants are at times\r\ncombined about as perfectly as if smoothly outspread on a level\r\nsurface. Where the soil happens to be composed of the finer qualities\r\nof glacial detritus and the water is not in excess, the nearest\r\napproach is made by the vegetation to that of the lake-meadow. But\r\nwhere, as is more commonly the case, the soil is coarse and bouldery,\r\nthe vegetation is correspondingly rank. Tall, wide-leaved grasses take\r\ntheir places along the sides, and rushes and nodding carices in the\r\nwetter portions, mingled with the most beautiful and imposing\r\nflowers,\xe2\x80\x94orange lilies and larkspurs seven or eight feet high, lupines,\r\nsenecios, aliums, painted-cups, many species of mimulus and pentstemon,\r\nthe ample boat-leaved _veratrum alba_, and the magnificent alpine\r\ncolumbine, with spurs an inch and a half long. At an elevation of from\r\nseven to nine thousand feet showy flowers frequently form the bulk of\r\nthe vegetation; then the hanging meadows become hanging gardens.\r\n\r\nIn rare instances we find an alpine basin the bottom of which is a\r\nperfect meadow, and the sides nearly all the way round, rising in\r\ngentle curves, are covered with moraine soil, which, being saturated\r\nwith melting snow from encircling fountains, gives rise to an almost\r\ncontinuous girdle of down-curving meadow vegetation that blends\r\ngracefully into the level meadow at the bottom, thus forming a grand,\r\nsmooth, soft, meadow-lined mountain nest. It is in meadows of this sort\r\nthat the mountain beaver (_Haplodon_) loves to make his home,\r\nexcavating snug chambers beneath the sod, digging canals, turning the\r\nunderground waters from channel to channel to suit his convenience, and\r\nfeeding the vegetation.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of meadow or bog occurs on densely timbered hillsides\r\nwhere small perennial streams have been dammed at short intervals by\r\nfallen trees. Still another kind is found hanging down smooth, flat\r\nprecipices, while corresponding leaning meadows rise to meet them.\r\n\r\nThere are also three kinds of small pot-hole meadows one of which is\r\nfound along the banks of the main streams, another on the summits of\r\nrocky ridges, and the third on glacier pavements, all of them\r\ninteresting in origin and brimful of plant beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\nTHE FORESTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coniferous forests of the Sierra are the grandest and most\r\nbeautiful in the world, and grow in a delightful climate on the most\r\ninteresting and accessible of mountain-ranges, yet strange to say they\r\nare not well known. More than sixty years ago David Douglas, an\r\nenthusiastic botanist and tree lover, wandered alone through fine\r\nsections of the Sugar Pine and Silver Fir woods wild with delight. A\r\nfew years later, other botanists made short journeys from the coast\r\ninto the lower woods. Then came the wonderful multitude of miners into\r\nthe foot-hill zone, mostly blind with gold-dust, soon followed by\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csheepmen,\xe2\x80\x9d who, with wool over their eyes, chased their flocks through\r\nall the forest belts from one end of the range to the other. Then the\r\nYosemite Valley was discovered, and thousands of admiring tourists\r\npassed through sections of the lower and middle zones on their way to\r\nthat wonderful park, and gained fine glimpses of the Sugar Pines and\r\nSilver Firs along the edges of dusty trails and roads. But few indeed,\r\nstrong and free with eyes undimmed with care, have gone far enough and\r\nlived long enough with the trees to gain anything like a loving\r\nconception of their grandeur and significance as manifested in the\r\nharmonies of their distribution and varying aspects throughout the\r\nseasons, as they stand arrayed in their winter garb rejoicing in\r\nstorms, putting forth their fresh leaves in the spring while steaming\r\nwith resiny fragrance, receiving the thunder-showers of summer, or\r\nreposing heavy-laden with ripe cones in the rich sungold of autumn. For\r\nknowledge of this kind one must dwell with the trees and grow with\r\nthem, without any reference to time in the almanac sense.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the general forest in belts is readily perceived.\r\nThese, as we have seen, extend in regular order from one extremity of\r\nthe range to the other; and however dense and somber they may appear in\r\ngeneral views, neither on the rocky heights nor down in the leafiest\r\nhollows will you find anything to remind you of the dank, malarial\r\nselvas of the Amazon and Orinoco, with, their \xe2\x80\x9cboundless contiguity of\r\nshade,\xe2\x80\x9d the monotonous uniformity of the Deodar forests of the\r\nHimalaya, the Black Forest of Europe, or the dense dark woods of\r\nDouglas Spruce where rolls the Oregon. The giant pines, and firs, and\r\nSequoias hold their arms open to the sunlight, rising above one another\r\non the mountain benches, marshaled in glorious array, giving forth the\r\nutmost expression of grandeur and beauty with inexhaustible variety and\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW IN THE SIERRA FOREST.]\r\n\r\nThe inviting openness of the Sierra woods is one of their most\r\ndistinguishing characteristics. The trees of all the species stand more\r\nor less apart in groves, or in small, irregular groups, enabling one to\r\nfind a way nearly everywhere, along sunny colonnades and through\r\nopenings that have a smooth, park-like surface, strewn with brown\r\nneedles and burs. Now you cross a wild garden, now a meadow, now a\r\nferny, willowy stream; and ever and anon you emerge from all the groves\r\nand flowers upon some granite pavement or high, bare ridge commanding\r\nsuperb views above the waving sea of evergreens far and near.\r\n\r\nOne would experience but little difficulty in riding on horseback\r\nthrough the successive belts all the way up to the storm-beaten fringes\r\nof the icy peaks. The deep ca\xc3\xb1ons, however, that extend from the axis\r\nof the range, cut the belts more or less completely into sections, and\r\nprevent the mounted traveler from tracing them lengthwise.\r\n\r\nThis simple arrangement in zones and sections brings the forest, as a\r\nwhole, within the comprehension of every observer. The different\r\nspecies are ever found occupying the same relative positions to one\r\nanother, as controlled by soil, climate, and the comparative vigor of\r\neach species in taking and holding the ground; and so appreciable are\r\nthese relations, one need never be at a loss in determining, within a\r\nfew hundred feet, the elevation above sea-level by the trees alone;\r\nfor, notwithstanding some of the species range upward for several\r\nthousand feet, and all pass one another more or less, yet even those\r\npossessing the greatest vertical range are available in this\r\nconnection, in as much as they take on new forms corresponding with the\r\nvariations in altitude.\r\n\r\nCrossing the treeless plains of the Sacramento and San Joaquin from the\r\nwest and reaching the Sierra foot-hills, you enter the lower fringe of\r\nthe forest, composed of small oaks and pines, growing so far apart that\r\nnot one twentieth of the surface of the ground is in shade at clear\r\nnoonday. After advancing fifteen or twenty miles, and making an ascent\r\nof from two to three thousand feet, you reach the lower margin of the\r\nmain pine belt, composed of the gigantic Sugar Pine, Yellow Pine,\r\nIncense Cedar, and Sequoia. Next you come to the magnificent Silver Fir\r\nbelt, and lastly to the upper pine belt, which sweeps up the rocky\r\nacclivities of the summit peaks in a dwarfed, wavering fringe to a\r\nheight of from ten to twelve thousand feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDGE OF THE TIMBER LINE ON MOUNT SHASTA.]\r\n\r\nThis general order of distribution, with reference to climate dependent\r\non elevation, is perceived at once, but there are other harmonies, as\r\nfar-reaching in this connection, that become manifest only after\r\npatient observation and study. Perhaps the most interesting of these is\r\nthe arrangement of the forests in long, curving bands, braided together\r\ninto lace-like patterns, and outspread in charming variety. The key to\r\nthis beautiful harmony is the ancient glaciers; where they flowed the\r\ntrees followed, tracing their wavering courses along ca\xc3\xb1ons, over\r\nridges, and over high, rolling plateaus. The Cedars of Lebanon, says\r\nHooker, are growing upon one of the moraines of an ancient glacier. All\r\nthe forests of the Sierra are growing upon moraines. But moraines\r\nvanish like the glaciers that make them. Every storm that falls upon\r\nthem wastes them, cutting gaps, disintegrating boulders, and carrying\r\naway their decaying material into new formations, until at length they\r\nare no longer recognizable by any save students, who trace their\r\ntransitional forms down from the fresh moraines still in process of\r\nformation, through those that are more and more ancient, and more and\r\nmore obscured by vegetation and all kinds of post-glacial weathering.\r\n\r\nHad the ice-sheet that once covered all the range been melted\r\nsimultaneously from the foot-hills to the summits, the flanks would, of\r\ncourse, have been left almost bare of soil, and these noble forests\r\nwould be wanting. Many groves and thickets would undoubtedly have grown\r\nup on lake and avalanche beds, and many a fair flower and shrub would\r\nhave found food and a dwelling-place in weathered nooks and crevices,\r\nbut the Sierra as a whole would have been a bare, rocky desert.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW IN THE MAIN PINE BELT OF THE SIERRA FOREST.]\r\n\r\nIt appears, therefore, that the Sierra forests in general indicate the\r\nextent and positions of the ancient moraines as well as they do lines\r\nof climate. For forests, properly speaking, cannot exist without soil;\r\nand, since the moraines have been deposited upon the solid rock, and\r\nonly upon elected places, leaving a considerable portion of the old\r\nglacial surface bare, we find luxuriant forests of pine and fir\r\nabruptly terminated by scored and polished pavements on which not even\r\na moss is growing, though soil alone is required to fit them for the\r\ngrowth of trees 200 feet in height.\r\n\r\nTHE NUT PINE\r\n(_Pinus Sabiniana_)\r\n\r\nThe Nut Pine, the first conifer met in ascending the range from the\r\nwest, grows only on the torrid foothills, seeming to delight in the\r\nmost ardent sun-heat, like a palm; springing up here and there singly,\r\nor in scattered groups of five or six, among scrubby White Oaks and\r\nthickets of ceanothus and manzanita; its extreme upper limit being\r\nabout 4000 feet above the sea, its lower about from 500 to 800 feet.\r\n\r\nThis tree is remarkable for its airy, widespread, tropical appearance,\r\nwhich suggests a region of palms, rather than cool, resiny pine woods.\r\nNo one would take it at first sight to be a conifer of any kind, it is\r\nso loose in habit and so widely branched, and its foliage is so thin\r\nand gray. Full-grown specimens are from forty to fifty feet in height,\r\nand from two to three feet in diameter. The trunk usually divides into\r\nthree or four main branches, about fifteen and twenty feet from the\r\nground, which, after bearing away from one another, shoot straight up\r\nand form separate summits; while the crooked subordinate branches\r\naspire, and radiate, and droop in ornamental sprays. The slender,\r\ngrayish-green needles are from eight to twelve inches long, loosely\r\ntasseled, and inclined to droop in handsome curves, contrasting with\r\nthe stiff, dark-colored trunk and branches in a very striking manner.\r\nNo other tree of my acquaintance, so substantial in body, is in its\r\nfoliage so thin and so pervious to the light. The sunbeams sift through\r\neven the leafiest trees with scarcely any interruption, and the weary,\r\nheated traveler finds but little protection in their shade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NUT PINE (_Pinus Sabiniana_)]\r\n\r\nThe generous crop of nutritious nuts which the Nut Pine yields makes it\r\na favorite with Indians, bears, and squirrels. The cones are most\r\nbeautiful, measuring from five to eight inches in length, and not much\r\nless in thickness, rich chocolate-brown in color, and protected by\r\nstrong, down-curving hooks which terminate the scales. Nevertheless,\r\nthe little Douglas squirrel can open them. Indians gathering the ripe\r\nnuts make a striking picture. The men climb the trees like bears and\r\nbeat off the cones with sticks, or recklessly cut off the more fruitful\r\nbranches with hatchets, while the squaws gather the big, generous\r\ncones, and roast them until the scales open sufficiently to allow the\r\nhard-shelled seeds to be beaten out. Then, in the cool evenings, men,\r\nwomen, and children, with their capacity for dirt greatly increased by\r\nthe soft resin with which they are all bedraggled, form circles around\r\ncamp-fires, on the bank of the nearest stream, and lie in easy\r\nindependence cracking nuts and laughing and chattering, as heedless of\r\nthe future as the squirrels.\r\n\r\n_Pinus tuberculata_\r\n\r\nThis curious little pine is found at an elevation of from 1500 to 3000\r\nfeet, growing in close, willowy groves. It is exceedingly slender and\r\ngraceful in habit, although trees that chance to stand alone outside\r\nthe groves sweep forth long, curved branches, producing a striking\r\ncontrast to the ordinary grove form. The foliage is of the same\r\npeculiar gray-green color as that of the Nut Pine, and is worn about as\r\nloosely, so that the body of the tree is scarcely obscured by it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GROVE FORM. THE ISOLATED FORM (PINUS TUBERCULATA).]\r\n\r\nAt the age of seven or eight years it begins to bear cones, not on\r\nbranches, but on the main axis, and, as they never fall off, the trunk\r\nis soon picturesquely dotted with them. The branches also become\r\nfruitful after they attain sufficient size. The average size of the\r\nolder trees is about thirty or forty feet in height, and twelve to\r\nfourteen inches in diameter. The cones are about four inches long,\r\nexceedingly hard, and covered with a sort of silicious varnish and gum,\r\nrendering them impervious to moisture, evidently with a view to the\r\ncareful preservation of the seeds.\r\n\r\nNo other conifer in the range is so closely restricted to special\r\nlocalities. It is usually found apart, standing deep in chaparral on\r\nsunny hill-and ca\xc3\xb1on-sides where there is but little depth of soil,\r\nand, where found at all, it is quite plentiful; but the ordinary\r\ntraveler, following carriage-roads and trails, may ascend the range\r\nmany times without meeting it.\r\n\r\nWhile exploring the lower portion of the Merced Ca\xc3\xb1on I found a lonely\r\nminer seeking his fortune in a quartz vein on a wild mountain-side\r\nplanted with this singular tree. He told me that he called it the\r\nHickory Pine, because of the whiteness and toughness of the wood. It is\r\nso little known, however, that it can hardly be said to have a common\r\nname. Most mountaineers refer to it as \xe2\x80\x9cthat queer little pine-tree\r\ncovered all over with burs.\xe2\x80\x9d In my studies of this species I found a\r\nvery interesting and significant group of facts, whose relations will\r\nbe seen almost as soon as stated:\r\n\r\n1st. All the trees in the groves I examined, however unequal in size,\r\nare of the same age.\r\n\r\n2d. Those groves are all planted on dry hillsides covered with\r\nchaparral, and therefore are liable to be swept by fire.\r\n\r\n3d. There are no seedlings or saplings in or about the living groves,\r\nbut there is always a fine, hopeful crop springing up on the ground\r\nonce occupied by any grove that has been destroyed by the burning of\r\nthe chaparral.\r\n\r\n4th. The cones never fall off and never discharge their seeds until the\r\ntree or branch to which they belong dies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOWER MARGIN OF THE MAIN PINE BELT, SHOWING OPEN\r\nCHARACTER OF WOODS.]\r\n\r\nA full discussion of the bearing of these facts upon one another would\r\nperhaps be out of place here, but I may at least call attention to the\r\nadmirable adaptation of the tree to the fire-swept regions where alone\r\nit is found. After a grove has been destroyed, the ground is at once\r\nsown lavishly with all the seeds ripened during its whole life, which\r\nseem to have been carefully held in store with reference to such a\r\ncalamity. Then a young grove immediately springs up, giving beauty for\r\nashes.\r\n\r\nSUGAR PINE\r\n(_Pinus Lambertiana_)\r\n\r\nThis is the noblest pine yet discovered, surpassing all others not\r\nmerely in size but also in kingly beauty and majesty.\r\n\r\nIt towers sublimely from every ridge and ca\xc3\xb1on of the range, at an\r\nelevation of from three to seven thousand feet above the sea, attaining\r\nmost perfect development at a height of about 5000 feet.\r\n\r\nFull-grown specimens are commonly about 220 feet high, and from six to\r\neight feet in diameter near the ground, though some grand old patriarch\r\nis occasionally met that has enjoyed five or six centuries of storms,\r\nand attained a thickness of ten or even twelve feet, living on\r\nundecayed, sweet and fresh in every fiber.\r\n\r\nIn southern Oregon, where it was first discovered by David Douglas, on\r\nthe head waters of the Umpqua, it attains still grander dimensions, one\r\nspecimen having been measured that was 245 feet high, and over eighteen\r\nfeet in diameter three feet from the ground. The discoverer was the\r\nDouglas for whom the noble Douglas Spruce is named, and many other\r\nplants which will keep his memory sweet and fresh as long as trees and\r\nflowers are loved. His first visit to the Pacific Coast was made in the\r\nyear 1825. The Oregon Indians watched him with curiosity as he wandered\r\nin the woods collecting specimens, and, unlike the fur-gathering\r\nstrangers they had hitherto known, caring nothing about trade. And when\r\nat length they came to know him better, and saw that from year to year\r\nthe growing things of the woods and prairies were his only objects of\r\npursuit, they called him \xe2\x80\x9cThe Man of Grass,\xe2\x80\x9d a title of which he was\r\nproud. During his first summer on the waters of the Columbia he made\r\nFort Vancouver his headquarters, making excursions from this Hudson Bay\r\npost in every direction. On one of his long trips he saw in an Indian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npouch some of the seeds of a new species of pine which he learned were\r\nobtained from a very large tree far to the southward of the Columbia.\r\nAt the end of the next summer, returning to Fort Vancouver after the\r\nsetting in of the winter rains, bearing in mind the big pine he had\r\nheard of, he set out on an excursion up the Willamette Valley in search\r\nof it; and how he fared, and what dangers and hardships he endured, are\r\nbest told in his own journal, from which I quote as follows:\r\n\r\n_October_ 26, 1826. Weather dull. Cold and cloudy. When my friends in\r\nEngland are made acquainted with my travels I fear they will think I\r\nhave told them nothing but my miseries\xe2\x80\xa6. I quitted my camp early in the\r\nmorning to survey the neighboring country, leaving my guide to take\r\ncharge of the horses until my return in the evening. About an hour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwalk from the camp I met an Indian, who on perceiving me instantly\r\nstrung his bow, placed on his left arm a sleeve of raccoon skin and\r\nstood on the defensive. Being quite sure that conduct was prompted by\r\nfear and not by hostile intentions, the poor fellow having probably\r\nnever seen such a being as myself before, I laid my gun at my feet on\r\nthe ground and waved my hand for him to come to me, which he did slowly\r\nand with great caution. I then made him place his bow and quiver of\r\narrows beside my gun, and striking a light gave him a smoke out of my\r\nown pipe and a present of a few beads. With my pencil I made a rough\r\nsketch of the cone and pine tree which I wanted to obtain, and drew his\r\nattention to it, when he instantly pointed with his hand to the hills\r\nfifteen or twenty miles distant towards the south; and when I expressed\r\nmy intention of going thither, cheerfully set out to accompany me. At\r\nmidday I reached my long-wished-for pines, and lost no time in\r\nexamining them and endeavoring to collect specimens and seeds. New and\r\nstrange things seldom fail to make strong impressions, and are\r\ntherefore frequently over-rated; so that, lest I should never see my\r\nfriends in England to inform them verbally of this most beautiful and\r\nimmensely grand tree, I shall here state the dimensions of the largest\r\nI could find among several that had been blown down by the wind. At 3\r\nfeet from the ground its circumference is 57 feet 9 inches; at 134\r\nfeet, 17 feet 5 inches; the extreme length 245 feet\xe2\x80\xa6. As it was\r\nimpossible either to climb the tree or hew it down, I endeavored to\r\nknock off the cones by firing at them with ball, when the report of my\r\ngun brought eight Indians, all of them painted with red earth, armed\r\nwith bows, arrows, bone-tipped spears, and flint-knives. They appeared\r\nanything but friendly. I explained to them what I wanted, and they\r\nseemed satisfied and sat down to smoke; but presently I saw one of them\r\nstring his bow, and another sharpen his flint knife with a pair of\r\nwooden pincers and suspend it off the wrist of his right hand. Further\r\ntestimony of their intentions was unnecessary. To save myself by flight\r\nwas impossible, so without hesitation I stepped back about five paces,\r\ncocked my gun, drew one of the pistols out of my belt, and holding it\r\nin my left hand and the gun in my right, showed myself determined to\r\nfight for my life. As much as possible I endeavored to preserve my\r\ncoolness, and thus we stood looking at one another without making any\r\nmovement or uttering a word for perhaps ten minutes, when one at last,\r\nwho seemed to be the leader, gave a sign that they wished for some\r\ntobacco; this I signified that they should have if they fetched a\r\nquantity of cones. They went off immediately in search of them, and no\r\nsooner were they all out of sight than I picked up my three cones and\r\nsome twigs of the trees and made the quickest possible retreat,\r\nhurrying back to the camp, which I reached before dusk\xe2\x80\xa6. I now write\r\nlying on the grass with my gun cocked beside me, and penning these\r\nlines by the light of my Columbian candle, namely, an ignited piece of\r\nrosin-wood.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis grand pine discovered under such, exciting circumstances Douglas\r\nnamed in honor of his friend Dr. Lambert of London.\r\n\r\nThe trunk is a smooth, round, delicately tapered shaft, mostly without\r\nlimbs, and colored rich purplish-brown, usually enlivened with tufts of\r\nyellow lichen. At the top of this magnificent bole, long, curving\r\nbranches sweep gracefully outward and downward, sometimes forming a\r\npalm-like crown, but far more nobly impressive than any palm crown I\r\never beheld. The needles are about three inches long, finely tempered\r\nand arranged in rather close tassels at the ends of slender branchlets\r\nthat clothe the long, outsweeping limbs. How well they sing in the\r\nwind, and how strikingly harmonious an effect is made by the immense\r\ncylindrical cones that depend loosely from the ends of the main\r\nbranches! No one knows what Nature can do in the way of pine-burs until\r\nhe has seen those of the Sugar Pine. They are commonly from fifteen to\r\neighteen inches long, and three in diameter; green, shaded with dark\r\npurple on their sunward sides. They are ripe in September and October.\r\nThen the flat scales open and the seeds take wing, but the empty cones\r\nbecome still more beautiful and effective, for their diameter is nearly\r\ndoubled by the spreading of the scales, and their color changes to a\r\nwarm yellowish-brown; while they remain swinging on the tree all the\r\nfollowing winter and summer, and continue effectively beautiful even on\r\nthe ground many years after they fall. The wood is deliciously\r\nfragrant, and fine in grain and texture; it is of a rich cream-yellow,\r\nas if formed of condensed sunbeams. _Retinospora obtusa, Siebold_, the\r\nglory of Eastern forests, is called \xe2\x80\x9cFu-si-no-ki\xe2\x80\x9d (tree of the sun) by\r\nthe Japanese; the Sugar Pine is the sun-tree of the Sierra.\r\nUnfortunately it is greatly prized by the lumbermen, and in accessible\r\nplaces is always the first tree in the woods to feel their steel. But\r\nthe regular lumbermen, with their saw-mills, have been, less generally\r\ndestructive thus far than the shingle-makers. The wood splits freely,\r\nand there is a constant demand for the shingles. And because an ax, and\r\nsaw, and frow are all the capital required for the business, many of\r\nthat drifting, unsteady class of men so large in California engage in\r\nit for a few months in the year. When prospectors, hunters, ranch\r\nhands, etc., touch their \xe2\x80\x9cbottom dollar\xe2\x80\x9d and find themselves out of\r\nemployment, they say, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can at least go to the Sugar Pines and\r\nmake shingles.\xe2\x80\x9d A few posts are set in the ground, and a single length\r\ncut from the first tree felled produces boards enough for the walls and\r\nroof of a cabin; all the rest the lumberman makes is for sale, and he\r\nis speedily independent. No gardener or haymaker is more sweetly\r\nperfumed than these rough mountaineers while engaged in this business,\r\nbut the havoc they make is most deplorable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUGAR PINE ON EXPOSED RIDGE.]\r\n\r\nThe sugar, from which the common name is derived, is to my taste the\r\nbest of sweets\xe2\x80\x94better than maple sugar. It exudes from the heart-wood,\r\nwhere wounds have been made, either by forest fires, or the ax, in the\r\nshape of irregular, crisp, candy-like kernels, which are crowded\r\ntogether in masses of considerable size, like clusters of resin-beads.\r\nWhen fresh, it is perfectly white and delicious, but, because most of\r\nthe wounds on which it is found have been made by fire, the exuding sap\r\nis stained on the charred surface, and the hardened sugar becomes\r\nbrown. Indians are fond of it, but on account of its laxative\r\nproperties only small quantities may be eaten. Bears, so fond of sweet\r\nthings in general, seem never to taste it; at least I have failed to\r\nfind any trace of their teeth in this connection.\r\n\r\nNo lover of trees will ever forget his first meeting with the Sugar\r\nPine, nor will he afterward need a poet to call him to \xe2\x80\x9clisten what the\r\npine-tree saith.\xe2\x80\x9d In most pine-trees there is a sameness of expression,\r\nwhich, to most people, is apt to become monotonous; for the typical\r\nspiry form, however beautiful, affords but little scope for appreciable\r\nindividual character. The Sugar Pine is as free from conventionalities\r\nof form and motion as any oak. No two are alike, even to the most\r\ninattentive observer; and, notwithstanding they are ever tossing out\r\ntheir immense arms in what might seem most extravagant gestures, there\r\nis a majesty and repose about them that precludes all possibility of\r\nthe grotesque, or even picturesque, in their general expression. They\r\nare the priests of pines, and seem ever to be addressing the\r\nsurrounding forest. The Yellow Pine is found growing with them on warm\r\nhillsides, and the White Silver Fir on cool northern slopes; but, noble\r\nas these are, the Sugar Pine is easily king, and spreads his arms above\r\nthem in blessing while they rock and wave in sign of recognition. The\r\nmain branches are sometimes found to be forty feet in length, yet\r\npersistently simple, seldom dividing at all, excepting near the end;\r\nbut anything like a bare cable appearance is prevented by the small,\r\ntasseled branchlets that extend all around them; and when these superb\r\nlimbs sweep out symmetrically on all sides, a crown sixty or seventy\r\nfeet wide is formed, which, gracefully poised on the summit of the\r\nnoble shaft, and filled with sunshine, is one of the most glorious\r\nforest objects conceivable. Commonly, however, there is a great\r\npreponderance of limbs toward the east, away from the direction of the\r\nprevailing winds.\r\n\r\nNo other pine seems to me so unfamiliar and self-contained. In\r\napproaching it, we feel as if in the presence of a superior being, and\r\nbegin to walk with a light step, holding our breath. Then, perchance,\r\nwhile we gaze awe-stricken, along comes a merry squirrel, chattering\r\nand laughing, to break the spell, running up the trunk with no\r\nceremony, and gnawing off the cones as if they were made only for him;\r\nwhile the carpenter-woodpecker hammers away at the bark, drilling holes\r\nin which to store his winter supply of acorns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YOUNG SUGAR PINE BEGINNING TO BEAR CONES.]\r\n\r\nAlthough so wild and unconventional when full-grown, the Sugar Pine is\r\na remarkably proper tree in youth. The old is the most original and\r\nindependent in appearance of all the Sierra evergreens; the young is\r\nthe most regular,\xe2\x80\x94a strict follower of coniferous fashions,\xe2\x80\x94slim,\r\nerect, with leafy, supple branches kept exactly in place, each tapering\r\nin outline and terminating in a spiry point. The successive\r\ntransitional forms presented between the cautious neatness of youth and\r\nbold freedom of maturity offer a delightful study. At the age of fifty\r\nor sixty years, the shy, fashionable form begins to be broken up.\r\nSpecialized branches push out in the most unthought-of places, and bend\r\nwith the great cones, at once marking individual character, and this\r\nbeing constantly augmented from year to year by the varying action of\r\nthe sunlight, winds, snow-storms, etc., the individuality of the tree\r\nis never again lost in the general forest.\r\n\r\nThe most constant companion of this species is the Yellow Pine, and a\r\nworthy companion it is.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOREST OF SEQUOIA, SUGAR PINE, AND DOUGLAS SPRUCE.]\r\n\r\nThe Douglas Spruce, Libocedrus, Sequoia, and the White Silver Fir are\r\nalso more or less associated with it; but on many deep-soiled\r\nmountain-sides, at an elevation of about 5000 feet above the sea, it\r\nforms the bulk of the forest, filling every swell and hollow and\r\ndown-plunging ravine. The majestic crowns, approaching each other in\r\nbold curves, make a glorious canopy through which the tempered sunbeams\r\npour, silvering the needles, and gilding the massive boles, and\r\nflowery, park-like ground, into a scene of enchantment.\r\n\r\nOn the most sunny slopes the white-flowered fragrant chamoebatia is\r\nspread like a carpet, brightened during early summer with the crimson\r\nSarcodes, the wild rose, and innumerable violets and gilias. Not even\r\nin the shadiest nooks will you find any rank, untidy weeds or\r\nunwholesome darkness. On the north sides of ridges the boles are more\r\nslender, and the ground is mostly occupied by an underbrush of hazel,\r\nceanothus, and flowering dogwood, but never so densely as to prevent\r\nthe traveler from sauntering where he will; while the crowning branches\r\nare never impenetrable to the rays of the sun, and never so\r\ninterblended as to lose their individuality.\r\n\r\nView the forest from beneath or from some commanding ridge-top; each\r\ntree presents a study in itself, and proclaims the surpassing grandeur\r\nof the species.\r\n\r\nYELLOW, OR SILVER PINE\r\n(_Pinus ponderosa_)\r\n\r\nThe Silver, or Yellow, Pine, as it is commonly called, ranks second\r\namong the pines of the Sierra as a lumber tree, and almost rivals the\r\nSugar Pine in stature and nobleness of port. Because of its superior\r\npowers of enduring variations of climate and soil, it has a more\r\nextensive range than any other conifer growing on the Sierra. On the\r\nwestern slope it is first met at an elevation of about 2000 feet, and\r\nextends nearly to the upper limit of the timber line. Thence, crossing\r\nthe range by the lowest passes, it descends to the eastern base, and\r\npushes out for a considerable distance into the hot volcanic plains,\r\ngrowing bravely upon well-watered moraines, gravelly lake basins,\r\narctic ridges, and torrid lava-beds; planting itself upon the lips of\r\ncraters, flourishing vigorously even there, and tossing ripe cones\r\namong the ashes and cinders of Nature\xe2\x80\x99s hearths.\r\n\r\nThe average size of full-grown trees on the western slope, where it is\r\nassociated with the Sugar Pine, is a little less than 200 feet in\r\nheight and from five to six feet in diameter, though specimens may\r\neasily be found that are considerably larger. I measured one, growing\r\nat an elevation of 4000 feet in the valley of the Merced, that is a few\r\ninches over eight feet in diameter, and 220 feet high.\r\n\r\nWhere there is plenty of free sunshine and other conditions are\r\nfavorable, it presents a striking contrast in form to the Sugar Pine,\r\nbeing a symmetrical spire, formed of a straight round trunk, clad with\r\ninnumerable branches that are divided over and over again. About one\r\nhalf of the trunk is commonly branchless, but where it grows at all\r\nclose, three fourths or more become naked; the tree presenting then a\r\nmore slender and elegant shaft than any other tree in the woods. The\r\nbark is mostly arranged in massive plates, some of them measuring four\r\nor five feet in length by eighteen inches in width, with a thickness of\r\nthree or four inches, forming a quite marked and distinguishing\r\nfeature. The needles are of a fine, warm, yellow-green color, six to\r\neight inches long, firm and elastic, and crowded in handsome, radiant\r\ntassels on the upturning ends of the branches. The cones are about\r\nthree or four inches long, and two and a half wide, growing in close,\r\nsessile clusters among the leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PINUS PONDEROSA]\r\n\r\nThe species attains its noblest form in filled-up lake basins,\r\nespecially in those of the older yosemites, and so prominent a part\r\ndoes it form of their groves that it may well be called the Yosemite\r\nPine. Ripe specimens favorably situated are almost always 200 feet or\r\nmore in height, and the branches clothe the trunk nearly to the ground,\r\nas seen in the illustration.\r\n\r\nThe Jeffrey variety attains its finest development in the northern\r\nportion of the range, in the wide basins of the McCloud and Pitt\r\nrivers, where it forms magnificent forests scarcely invaded by any\r\nother tree. It differs from the ordinary form in size, being only about\r\nhalf as tall, and in its redder and more closely furrowed bark,\r\ngrayish-green foliage, less divided branches, and larger cones; but\r\nintermediate forms come in which make a clear separation impossible,\r\nalthough some botanists regard it as a distinct species. It is this\r\nvariety that climbs storm-swept ridges, and wanders out among the\r\nvolcanoes of the Great Basin. Whether exposed to extremes of heat or\r\ncold, it is dwarfed like every other tree, and becomes all knots and\r\nangles, wholly unlike the majestic forms we have been sketching. Old\r\nspecimens, bearing cones about as big as pineapples, may sometimes be\r\nfound clinging to rifted rocks at an elevation of seven or eight\r\nthousand feet, whose highest branches scarce reach above one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILVER PINE 210 FEET HIGH. (THE FORM GROWING IN\r\nYOSEMITE VALLEY.)]\r\n\r\nI have oftentimes feasted on the beauty of these noble trees when they\r\nwere towering in all their winter grandeur, laden with snow\xe2\x80\x94one mass of\r\nbloom; in summer, too, when the brown, staminate clusters hang thick\r\namong the shimmering needles, and the big purple burs are ripening in\r\nthe mellow light; but it is during cloudless wind-storms that these\r\ncolossal pines are most impressively beautiful. Then they bow like\r\nwillows, their leaves streaming forward all in one direction, and, when\r\nthe sun shines upon them at the required angle, entire groves glow as\r\nif every leaf were burnished silver. The fall of tropic light on the\r\nroyal crown of a palm is a truly glorious spectacle, the fervid\r\nsun-flood breaking upon the glossy leaves in long lance-rays, like\r\nmountain water among boulders. But to me there is something more\r\nimpressive in the fall of light upon these Silver Pines. It seems\r\nbeaten to the finest dust, and is shed off in myriads of minute\r\nsparkles that seem to come from the very heart of the trees, as if,\r\nlike rain falling upon fertile soil, it had been absorbed, to reappear\r\nin flowers of light.\r\n\r\nThis species also gives forth the finest music to the wind. After\r\nlistening to it in all kinds of winds, night and day, season after\r\nseason, I think I could approximate to my position on the mountains by\r\nthis pine-music alone. If you would catch the tones of separate\r\nneedles, climb a tree. They are well tempered, and give forth no\r\nuncertain sound, each standing out, with no interference excepting\r\nduring heavy gales; then you may detect the click of one needle upon\r\nanother, readily distinguishable from their free, wing-like hum. Some\r\nidea of their temper may be drawn from the fact that, notwithstanding\r\nthey are so long, the vibrations that give rise to the peculiar\r\nshimmering of the light are made at the rate of about two hundred and\r\nfifty per minute.\r\n\r\nWhen a Sugar Pine and one of this species equal in size are observed\r\ntogether, the latter is seen to be far more simple in manners, more\r\nlithely graceful, and its beauty is of a kind more easily appreciated;\r\nbut then, it is, on the other hand, much less dignified and original in\r\ndemeanor. The Silver Pine seems eager to shoot aloft. Even while it is\r\ndrowsing in autumn sun-gold, you may still detect a skyward aspiration.\r\nBut the Sugar Pine seems too unconsciously noble, and too complete in\r\nevery way, to leave room for even a heavenward care.\r\n\r\nDOUGLAS SPRUCE\r\n(_Pseudotsuga Douglasii_)\r\n\r\nThis tree is the king of the spruces, as the Sugar Pine is king of\r\npines. It is by far the most majestic spruce I ever beheld in any\r\nforest, and one of the largest and longest lived of the giants that\r\nflourish throughout the main pine belt, often attaining a height of\r\nnearly 200 feet, and a diameter of six or seven. Where the growth is\r\nnot too close, the strong, spreading branches come more than halfway\r\ndown the trunk, and these are hung with innumerable slender, swaying\r\nsprays, that are handsomely feathered with the short leaves which\r\nradiate at right angles all around them. This vigorous spruce is ever\r\nbeautiful, welcoming the mountain winds and the snow as well as the\r\nmellow summer light, and maintaining its youthful freshness\r\nundiminished from century to century through a thousand storms.\r\n\r\nIt makes its finest appearance in the months of June and July. The rich\r\nbrown buds with which its sprays are tipped swell and break about this\r\ntime, revealing the young leaves, which at first are bright yellow,\r\nmaking the tree appear as if covered with gay blossoms; while the\r\npendulous bracted cones with their shell-like scales are a constant\r\nadornment.\r\n\r\nThe young trees are mostly gathered into beautiful family groups, each\r\nsapling exquisitely symmetrical. The primary branches are whorled\r\nregularly around the axis, generally in fives, while each is draped\r\nwith long, feathery sprays, that descend in curves as free and as\r\nfinely drawn as those of falling water.\r\n\r\nIn Oregon and Washington it grows in dense forests, growing tall and\r\nmast-like to a height of 300 feet, and is greatly prized as a lumber\r\ntree. But in the Sierra it is scattered among other trees, or forms\r\nsmall groves, seldom ascending higher than 5500 feet, and never making\r\nwhat would be called a forest. It is not particular in its choice of\r\nsoil\xe2\x80\x94wet or dry, smooth or rocky, it makes out to live well on them\r\nall. Two of the largest specimens I have measured are in Yosemite\r\nValley, one of which is more than eight feet in diameter, and is\r\ngrowing upon the terminal moraine of the residual glacier that occupied\r\nthe South Fork Canon; the other is nearly as large, growing upon\r\nangular blocks of granite that have been shaken from the precipitous\r\nfront of the Liberty Cap near the Nevada Fall. No other tree seems so\r\ncapable of adapting itself to earthquake taluses, and many of these\r\nrough boulder-slopes are occupied by it almost exclusively, especially\r\nin yosemite gorges moistened by the spray of waterfalls.\r\n\r\nINCENSE CEDAR\r\n(_Libocedrus decurrens_)\r\n\r\nThe Incense Cedar is another of the giants quite generally distributed\r\nthroughout this portion of the forest, without exclusively occupying\r\nany considerable area, or even making extensive groves. It ascends to\r\nabout 5000 feet on the warmer hillsides, and reaches the climate most\r\ncongenial to it at about from 3000 to 4000 feet, growing vigorously at\r\nthis elevation on all kinds of soil, and in particular it is capable of\r\nenduring more moisture about its roots than any of its companions,\r\nexcepting only the Sequoia.\r\n\r\nThe largest specimens are about 150 feet high, and seven feet in\r\ndiameter. The bark is brown, of a singularly rich tone very attractive\r\nto artists, and the foliage is tinted with a warmer yellow than that of\r\nany other evergreen in the woods. Casting your eye over the general\r\nforest from some ridge-top, the color alone of its spiry summits is\r\nsufficient to identify it in any company.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INCENSE CEDAR IN ITS PRIME.]\r\n\r\nIn youth, say up to the age of seventy or eighty years, no other tree\r\nforms so strictly tapered a cone from top to bottom. The branches swoop\r\noutward and downward in bold curves, excepting the younger ones near\r\nthe top, which aspire, while the lowest droop to the ground, and all\r\nspread out in flat, ferny plumes, beautifully fronded, and imbricated\r\nupon one another. As it becomes older, it grows strikingly irregular\r\nand picturesque. Large special branches put out at right angles from\r\nthe trunk, form big, stubborn elbows, and then shoot up parallel with\r\nthe axis. Very old trees are usually dead at the top, the main axis\r\nprotruding above ample masses of green plumes, gray and lichen-covered,\r\nand drilled full of acorn holes by the woodpeckers. The plumes are\r\nexceedingly beautiful; no waving fern-frond in shady dell is more\r\nunreservedly beautiful in form and texture, or half so inspiring in\r\ncolor and spicy fragrance. In its prime, the whole tree is thatched\r\nwith them, so that they shed off rain and snow like a roof, making fine\r\nmansions for storm-bound birds and mountaineers. But if you would see\r\nthe _Libocedrus_ in all its glory, you must go to the woods in winter.\r\nThen it is laden with myriads of four-sided staminate cones about the\r\nsize of wheat grains,\xe2\x80\x94winter wheat,\xe2\x80\x94producing a golden tinge, and\r\nforming a noble illustration of Nature\xe2\x80\x99s immortal vigor and virility.\r\nThe fertile cones are about three fourths of an inch long, borne on the\r\noutside of the plumy branchlets, where they serve to enrich still more\r\nthe surpassing beauty of this grand winter-blooming goldenrod.\r\n\r\nWHITE SILVER FIR\r\n(_Abies concolor_)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOREST OF GRAND SILVER FIRS. TWO SEQUOIAS IN THE\r\nFOREGROUND ON THE LEFT.]\r\n\r\nWe come now to the most regularly planted of all the main forest belts,\r\ncomposed almost exclusively of two noble firs\xe2\x80\x94_A. concolor_ and _A.\r\nmagnifica_. It extends with no marked interruption for 450 miles, at an\r\nelevation of from 5000 to nearly 9000 feet above the sea. In its youth\r\n_A. concolor_ is a charmingly symmetrical tree with branches regularly\r\nwhorled in level collars around its whitish-gray axis, which terminates\r\nin a strong, hopeful shoot. The leaves are in two horizontal rows,\r\nalong branchlets that commonly are less than eight years old, forming\r\nhandsome plumes, pinnated like the fronds of ferns. The cones are\r\ngrayish-green when ripe, cylindrical, about from three to four inches\r\nlong by one and a half to two inches wide, and stand upright on the\r\nupper branches.\r\n\r\nFull-grown trees, favorably situated as to soil and exposure, are about\r\n200 feet high, and five or six feet in diameter near the ground, though\r\nlarger specimens are by no means rare.\r\n\r\nAs old age creeps on, the bark becomes rougher and grayer, the branches\r\nlose their exact regularity, many are snow-bent or broken off, and the\r\nmain axis often becomes double or otherwise irregular from accidents to\r\nthe terminal bud or shoot; but throughout all the vicissitudes of its\r\nlife on the mountains, come what may, the noble grandeur of the species\r\nis patent to every eye.\r\n\r\nMAGNIFICENT SILVER FIR, OR RED FIR\r\n(_Abies magnifica_)\r\n\r\nThis is the most charmingly symmetrical of all the giants of the Sierra\r\nwoods, far surpassing its companion species in this respect, and easily\r\ndistinguished from it by the purplish-red bark, which is also more\r\nclosely furrowed than that of the white, and by its larger cones, more\r\nregularly whorled and fronded branches, and by its leaves, which are\r\nshorter, and grow all around the branchlets and point upward.\r\n\r\nIn size, these two Silver Firs are about equal, the _magnifica_ perhaps\r\na little the taller. Specimens from 200 to 250 feet high are not rare\r\non well-ground moraine soil, at an elevation of from 7500 to 8500 feet\r\nabove sea-level. The largest that I measured stands back three miles\r\nfrom the brink of the north wall of Yosemite Valley. Fifteen years ago\r\nit was 240 feet high, with a diameter of a little more than five feet.\r\n\r\nHappy the man with the freedom and the love to climb one of these\r\nsuperb trees in full flower and fruit. How admirable the forest-work of\r\nNature is then seen to be, as one makes his way up through the midst of\r\nthe broad, fronded branches, all arranged in exquisite order around the\r\ntrunk, like the whorled leaves of lilies, and each branch and branchlet\r\nabout as strictly pinnate as the most symmetrical fern-frond. The\r\nstaminate cones are seen growing straight downward from the under side\r\nof the young branches in lavish profusion, making fine purple clusters\r\namid the grayish-green foliage. On the topmost branches the fertile\r\ncones are set firmly on end like small casks. They are about six inches\r\nlong, three wide, covered with a fine gray down, and streaked with\r\ncrystal balsam that seems to have been poured upon each cone from\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nBoth the Silver Firs live 250 years or more when the conditions about\r\nthem are at all favorable. Some venerable patriarch may often be seen,\r\nheavily storm-marked, towering in severe majesty above the rising\r\ngeneration, with a protecting grove of saplings pressing close around\r\nhis feet, each dressed with such loving care that not a leaf seems\r\nwanting. Other companies are made up of trees near the prime of life,\r\nexquisitely harmonized to one another in form and gesture, as if Nature\r\nhad culled them one by one with nice discrimination from all the rest\r\nof the woods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF FOREST OF THE MAGNIFICENT SILVER FIR.]\r\n\r\nIt is from this tree, called Red Fir by the lumberman, that\r\nmountaineers always cut boughs to sleep on when they are so fortunate\r\nas to be within its limits. Two rows of the plushy branches overlapping\r\nalong the middle, and a crescent of smaller plumes mixed with ferns and\r\nflowers for a pillow, form the very best bed imaginable. The essences\r\nof the pressed leaves seem to fill every pore of one\xe2\x80\x99s body, the sounds\r\nof falling water make a soothing hush, while the spaces between the\r\ngrand spires afford noble openings through which to gaze dreamily into\r\nthe starry sky. Even in the matter of sensuous ease, any combination of\r\ncloth, steel springs, and feathers seems vulgar in comparison.\r\n\r\nThe fir woods are delightful sauntering-grounds at any time of year,\r\nbut most so in autumn. Then the noble trees are hushed in the hazy\r\nlight, and drip with balsam; the cones are ripe, and the seeds, with\r\ntheir ample purple wings, mottle the air like flocks of butterflies;\r\nwhile deer feeding in the flowery openings between the groves, and\r\nbirds and squirrels in the branches, make a pleasant stir which\r\nenriches the deep, brooding calm of the wilderness, and gives a\r\npeculiar impressiveness to every tree. No wonder the enthusiastic\r\nDouglas went wild with joy when he first discovered this species. Even\r\nin the Sierra, where so many noble evergreens challenge admiration, we\r\nlinger among these colossal firs with fresh love, and extol their\r\nbeauty again and again, as if no other in the world could henceforth\r\nclaim our regard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILVER-FIR FOREST GROWING ON MORAINES OF THE HOFFMAN\r\nAND TENAYA GLACIERS.]\r\n\r\nIt is in these woods the great granite domes rise that are so striking\r\nand characteristic a feature of the Sierra. And here too we find the\r\nbest of the garden meadows. They lie level on the tops of the dividing\r\nridges, or sloping on the sides of them, embedded in the magnificent\r\nforest. Some of these meadows are in great part occupied by\r\n_Veratrumalba_, which here grows rank and tall, with boat-shaped leaves\r\nthirteen inches long and twelve inches wide, ribbed like those of\r\ncypripedium. Columbine grows on the drier margins with tall larkspurs\r\nand lupines waist-deep in grasses and sedges; several species of\r\ncastilleia also make a bright show in beds of blue and white violets\r\nand daisies. But the glory of these forest meadows is a lily\xe2\x80\x94_L.\r\nparvum_. The flowers are orange-colored and quite small, the smallest I\r\never saw of the true lilies; but it is showy nevertheless, for it is\r\nseven to eight feet high and waves magnificent racemes of ten to twenty\r\nflowers or more over one\xe2\x80\x99s head, while it stands out in the open ground\r\nwith just enough of grass and other plants about it to make a fringe\r\nfor its feet and show it off to best advantage.\r\n\r\nA dry spot a little way back from the margin of a Silver Fir lily\r\ngarden makes a glorious campground, especially where the slope is\r\ntoward the east and opens a view of the distant peaks along the summit\r\nof the range. The tall lilies are brought forward in all their glory by\r\nthe light of your blazing camp-fire, relieved against the outer\r\ndarkness, and the nearest of the trees with their whorled branches\r\ntower above you like larger lilies, and the sky seen through the garden\r\nopening seems one vast meadow of white lily stars.\r\n\r\nIn the morning everything is joyous and bright, the delicious purple of\r\nthe dawn changes softly to daffodil yellow and white; while the\r\nsunbeams pouring through the passes between the peaks give a margin of\r\ngold to each of them. Then the spires of the firs in the hollows of the\r\nmiddle region catch the glow, and your camp grove is filled with light.\r\nThe birds begin to stir, seeking sunny branches on the edge of the\r\nmeadow for sun-baths after the cold night, and looking for their\r\nbreakfasts, every one of them as fresh as a lily and as charmingly\r\narrayed. Innumerable insects begin to dance, the deer withdraw from the\r\nopen glades and ridge-tops to their leafy hiding-places in the\r\nchaparral, the flowers open and straighten their petals as the dew\r\nvanishes, every pulse beats high, every life-cell rejoices, the very\r\nrocks seem to tingle with life, and God is felt brooding over\r\neverything great and small.\r\n\r\nBIG TREE\r\n(_Sequoia gigantea_)\r\n\r\nBetween the heavy pine and Silver Fir belts we find the Big Tree, the\r\nking of all the conifers in the world, \xe2\x80\x9cthe noblest of a noble race.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nIt extends in a widely interrupted belt from a small grove on the\r\nmiddle fork of the American River to the head of Deer Creek, a distance\r\nof about 260 miles, the northern limit being near the thirty-ninth\r\nparallel, the southern a little below the thirty-sixth, and the\r\nelevation of the belt above the sea varies from about 5000 to 8000\r\nfeet. From the American River grove to the forest on King\xe2\x80\x99s River the\r\nspecies occurs only in small isolated groups so sparsely distributed\r\nalong the belt that three of the gaps in it are from forty to sixty\r\nmiles wide. But from King\xe2\x80\x99s River southward the Sequoia is not\r\nrestricted to mere groves, but extends across the broad rugged basins\r\nof the Kaweah and Tule rivers in noble forests, a distance of nearly\r\nseventy miles, the continuity of this part of the belt being broken\r\nonly by deep ca\xc3\xb1ons. The Fresno, the largest of the northern groves,\r\noccupies an area of three or four square miles, a short distance to the\r\nsouthward of the famous Mariposa Grove. Along the beveled rim of the\r\nca\xc3\xb1on of the south fork of King\xe2\x80\x99s River there is a majestic forest of\r\nSequoia about six miles long by two wide. This is the northernmost\r\nassemblage of Big Trees that may fairly be called a forest. Descending\r\nthe precipitous divide between the King\xe2\x80\x99s River and Kaweah you enter\r\nthe grand forests that form the main continuous portion of the belt.\r\nAdvancing southward the giants become more and more irrepressibly\r\nexuberant, heaving their massive crowns into the sky from every ridge\r\nand slope, and waving onward in graceful compliance with the\r\ncomplicated topography of the region. The finest of the Kaweah section\r\nof the belt is on the broad ridge between Marble Creek and the middle\r\nfork, and extends from the granite headlands overlooking the hot plains\r\nto within a few miles of the cool glacial fountains of the summit\r\npeaks. The extreme upper limit of the belt is reached between the\r\nmiddle and south forks of the Kaweah at an elevation of 8400 feet. But\r\nthe finest block of Big Tree forest in the entire belt is on the north\r\nfork of Tule River. In the northern groves there are comparatively few\r\nyoung trees or saplings. But here for every old, storm-stricken giant\r\nthere are many in all the glory of prime vigor, and for each of these a\r\ncrowd of eager, hopeful young trees and saplings growing heartily on\r\nmoraines, rocky ledges, along watercourses, and in the moist alluvium\r\nof meadows, seemingly in hot pursuit of eternal life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  SEQUOIA GIGANTEA\xe2\x80\x94VIEW IN GENERAL GRANT NATIONAL PARK.]\r\n\r\nBut though the area occupied by the species increases so much from\r\nnorth to south there is no marked increase in the size of the trees. A\r\nheight of 275 feet and a diameter near the ground of about 20 feet is\r\nperhaps about the average size of full-grown trees favorably situated;\r\nspecimens 25 feet in diameter are not very rare, and a few are nearly\r\n300 feet high. In the Calaveras Grove there are four trees over 300\r\nfeet in height, the tallest of which by careful measurement is 325\r\nfeet. The largest I have yet met in the course of my explorations is a\r\nmajestic old scarred monument in the King\xe2\x80\x99s River forest. It is 35 feet\r\n8 inches in diameter inside the bark four feet from the ground. Under\r\nthe most favorable conditions these giants probably live 5000 years or\r\nmore, though few of even the larger trees are more than half as old. I\r\nnever saw a Big Tree that had died a natural death; barring accidents\r\nthey seem to be immortal, being exempt from all the diseases that\r\nafflict and kill other trees. Unless destroyed by man, they live on\r\nindefinitely until burned, smashed by lightning, or cast down by\r\nstorms, or by the giving way of the ground on which they stand. The age\r\nof one that was felled in the Calaveras Grove, for the sake of having\r\nits stump for a dancing-floor, was about 1300 years, and its diameter,\r\nmeasured across the stump, 24 feet inside the bark. Another that was\r\ncut down in the King\xe2\x80\x99s River forest was about the same size, but nearly\r\na thousand years older (2200 years), though not a very old-looking\r\ntree. It was felled to procure a section for exhibition, and thus an\r\nopportunity was given to count its annual rings of growth. The colossal\r\nscarred monument in the King\xe2\x80\x99s River forest mentioned above is burned\r\nhalf through, and I spent a day in making an estimate of its age,\r\nclearing away the charred surface with an ax and carefully counting the\r\nannual rings with the aid of a pocket-lens. The wood-rings in the\r\nsection I laid bare were so involved and contorted in some places that\r\nI was not able to determine its age exactly, but I counted over 4000\r\nrings, which showed that this tree was in its prime, swaying in the\r\nSierra winds, when Christ walked the earth. No other tree in the world,\r\nas far as I know, has looked down on so many centuries as the Sequoia,\r\nor opens such impressive and suggestive views into history.\r\n\r\nSo exquisitely harmonious and finely balanced are even the very\r\nmightiest of these monarchs of the woods in all their proportions and\r\ncircumstances there never is anything overgrown or monstrous-looking\r\nabout them. On coming in sight of them for the first time, you are\r\nlikely to say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, see what beautiful, noble-looking trees are\r\ntowering there among the firs and pines!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94their grandeur being in the\r\nmean time in great part invisible, but to the living eye it will be\r\nmanifested sooner or later, stealing slowly on the senses, like the\r\ngrandeur of Niagara, or the lofty Yosemite domes. Their great size is\r\nhidden from the inexperienced observer as long as they are seen at a\r\ndistance in one harmonious view. When, however, you approach them and\r\nwalk round them, you begin to wonder at their colossal size and seek a\r\nmeasuring-rod. These giants bulge considerably at the base, but not\r\nmore than is required for beauty and safety; and the only reason that\r\nthis bulging seems in some cases excessive is that only a comparatively\r\nsmall section of the shaft is seen at once in near views. One that I\r\nmeasured in the King\xe2\x80\x99s River forest was 25 feet in diameter at the\r\nground, and 10 feet in diameter 200 feet above the ground, showing that\r\nthe taper of the trunk as a whole is charmingly fine. And when you\r\nstand back far enough to see the massive columns from the swelling\r\ninstep to the lofty summit dissolving in a dome of verdure, you rejoice\r\nin the unrivaled display of combined grandeur and beauty. About a\r\nhundred feet or more of the trunk is usually branchless, but its\r\nmassive simplicity is relieved by the bark furrows, which instead of\r\nmaking an irregular network run evenly parallel, like the fluting of an\r\narchitectural column, and to some extent by tufts of slender sprays\r\nthat wave lightly in the winds and cast flecks of shade, seeming to\r\nhave been pinned on here and there for the sake of beauty only. The\r\nyoung trees have slender simple branches down to the ground, put on\r\nwith strict regularity, sharply aspiring at the top, horizontal about\r\nhalf-way down, and drooping in handsome curves at the base. By the time\r\nthe sapling is five or six hundred years old this spiry, feathery,\r\njuvenile habit merges into the firm, rounded dome form of middle age,\r\nwhich in turn takes on the eccentric picturesqueness of old age. No\r\nother tree in the Sierra forest has foliage so densely massed or\r\npresents outlines so firmly drawn and so steadily subordinate to a\r\nspecial type. A knotty ungovernable-looking branch five to eight feet\r\nthick may be seen pushing out abruptly from the smooth trunk, as if\r\nsure to throw the regular curve into confusion, but as soon as the\r\ngeneral outline is reached it stops short and dissolves in spreading\r\nbosses of law-abiding sprays, just as if every tree were growing\r\nbeneath some huge, invisible bell-glass, against whose sides every\r\nbranch was being pressed and molded, yet somehow indulging in so many\r\nsmall departures from the regular form that there is still an\r\nappearance of freedom.\r\n\r\nThe foliage of the saplings is dark bluish-green in color, while the\r\nolder trees ripen to a warm brownish-yellow tint like Libocedrus. The\r\nbark is rich cinnamon-brown, purplish in young trees and in shady\r\nportions of the old, while the ground is covered with brown leaves and\r\nburs forming color-masses of extraordinary richness, not to mention the\r\nflowers and underbrush that rejoice about them in their seasons. Walk\r\nthe Sequoia woods at any time of year and you will say they are the\r\nmost beautiful and majestic on earth. Beautiful and impressive\r\ncontrasts meet you everywhere: the colors of tree and flower, rock and\r\nsky, light and shade, strength and frailty, endurance and evanescence,\r\ntangles of supple hazel-bushes, tree-pillars about as rigid as granite\r\ndomes, roses and violets, the smallest of their kind, blooming around\r\nthe feet of the giants, and rugs of the lowly chamaebatia where the\r\nsunbeams fall. Then in winter the trees themselves break forth in\r\nbloom, myriads of small four-sided staminate cones crowd the ends of\r\nthe slender sprays, coloring the whole tree, and when ripe dusting the\r\nair and the ground with golden pollen. The fertile cones are bright\r\ngrass-green, measuring about two inches in length by one and a half in\r\nthickness, and are made up of about forty firm rhomboidal scales\r\ndensely packed, with from five to eight seeds at the base of each. A\r\nsingle cone, therefore, contains from two to three hundred seeds, which\r\nare about a fourth of an inch long by three sixteenths wide, including\r\na thin, flat margin that makes them go glancing and wavering in their\r\nfall like a boy\xe2\x80\x99s kite. The fruitfulness of Sequoia may be illustrated\r\nby two specimen branches one and a half and two inches in diameter on\r\nwhich I counted 480 cones. No other Sierra conifer produces nearly so\r\nmany seeds. Millions are ripened annually by a single tree, and in a\r\nfruitful year the product of one of the northern groves would be enough\r\nto plant all the mountain-ranges of the world. Nature takes care,\r\nhowever, that not one seed in a million shall germinate at all, and of\r\nthose that do perhaps not one in ten thousand is suffered to live\r\nthrough the many vicissitudes of storm, drought, fire, and\r\nsnow-crushing that beset their youth.\r\n\r\nThe Douglas squirrel is the happy harvester of most of the Sequoia\r\ncones. Out of every hundred perhaps ninety fall to his share, and\r\nunless cut off by his ivory sickle they shake out their seeds and\r\nremain on the tree for many years. Watching the squirrels at their\r\nharvest work in the Indian summer is one of the most delightful\r\ndiversions imaginable. The woods are calm and the ripe colors are\r\nblazing in all their glory; the cone-laden trees stand motionless in\r\nthe warm, hazy air, and you may see the crimson-crested woodcock, the\r\nprince of Sierra woodpeckers, drilling some dead limb or fallen trunk\r\nwith his bill, and ever and anon filling the glens with his happy\r\ncackle. The humming-bird, too, dwells in these noble woods, and may\r\noftentimes be seen glancing among the flowers or resting wing-weary on\r\nsome leafless twig; here also are the familiar robin of the orchards,\r\nand the brown and grizzly bears so obviously fitted for these majestic\r\nsolitudes; and the Douglas squirrel, making more hilarious, exuberant,\r\nvital stir than all the bears, birds, and humming wings together.\r\n\r\nAs soon as any accident happens to the crown of these Sequoias, such as\r\nbeing stricken off by lightning or broken by storms, then the branches\r\nbeneath the wound, no matter how situated, seem to be excited like a\r\ncolony of bees that have lost their queen, and become anxious to repair\r\nthe damage. Limbs that have grown outward for centuries at right angles\r\nto the trunk begin to turn upward to assist in making a new crown, each\r\nspeedily assuming the special form of true summits. Even in the case of\r\nmere stumps, burned half through, some mere ornamental tuft will try to\r\ngo aloft and do its best as a leader in forming a new head.\r\n\r\nGroups of two or three of these grand trees are often found standing\r\nclose together, the seeds from which they sprang having probably grown\r\non ground cleared for their reception by the fall of a large tree of a\r\nformer generation. These patches of fresh, mellow soil beside the\r\nupturned roots of the fallen giant may be from forty to sixty feet\r\nwide, and they are speedily occupied by seedlings. Out of these\r\nseedling-thickets perhaps two or three may become trees, forming those\r\nclose groups called \xe2\x80\x9cthree graces,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cloving couples,\xe2\x80\x9d etc. For even\r\nsupposing that the trees should stand twenty or thirty feet apart while\r\nyoung, by the time they are full-grown their trunks will touch and\r\ncrowd against each other and even appear as one in some cases.\r\n\r\nIt is generally believed that this grand Sequoia was once far more\r\nwidely distributed over the Sierra; but after long and careful study I\r\nhave come to the conclusion that it never was, at least since the close\r\nof the glacial period, because a diligent search along the margins of\r\nthe groves, and in the gaps between, fails to reveal a single trace of\r\nits previous existence beyond its present bounds. Notwithstanding, I\r\nfeel confident that if every Sequoia in the range were to die to-day,\r\nnumerous monuments of their existence would remain, of so imperishable\r\na nature as to be available for the student more than ten thousand\r\nyears hence.\r\n\r\nIn the first place we might notice that no species of coniferous tree\r\nin the range keeps its individuals so well together as Sequoia; a mile\r\nis perhaps the greatest distance of any straggler from the main body,\r\nand all of those stragglers that have come under my observation are\r\nyoung, instead of old monumental trees, relics of a more extended\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nAgain, Sequoia trunks frequently endure for centuries after they fall.\r\nI have a specimen block, cut from a fallen trunk, which is hardly\r\ndistinguishable from specimens cut from living trees, although the old\r\ntrunk-fragment from which it was derived has lain in the damp forest\r\nmore than 380 years, probably thrice as long. The time measure in the\r\ncase is simply this: when the ponderous trunk to which the old vestige\r\nbelonged fell, it sunk itself into the ground, thus making a long,\r\nstraight ditch, and in the middle of this ditch a Silver Fir is growing\r\nthat is now four feet in diameter and 380 years old, as determined by\r\ncutting it half through and counting the rings, thus demonstrating that\r\nthe remnant of the trunk that made the ditch has lain on the ground\r\n_more_ than 380 years. For it is evident that to find the whole time,\r\nwe must add to the 380 years the time that the vanished portion of the\r\ntrunk lay in the ditch before being burned out of the way, plus the\r\ntime that passed before the seed from which the monumental fir sprang\r\nfell into the prepared soil and took root. Now, because Sequoia trunks\r\nare never wholly consumed in one forest fire, and those fires recur\r\nonly at considerable intervals, and because Sequoia ditches after being\r\ncleared are often left unplanted for centuries, it becomes evident that\r\nthe trunk remnant in question may probably have lain a thousand years\r\nor more. And this instance is by no means a rare one.\r\n\r\nBut admitting that upon those areas supposed to have been once covered\r\nwith Sequoia every tree may have fallen, and every trunk may have been\r\nburned or buried, leaving not a remnant, many of the ditches made by\r\nthe fall of the ponderous trunks, and the bowls made by their upturning\r\nroots, would remain patent for thousands of years after the last\r\nvestige of the trunks that made them had vanished. Much of this\r\nditch-writing would no doubt be quickly effaced by the flood-action of\r\noverflowing streams and rain-washing; but no inconsiderable portion\r\nwould remain enduringly engraved on ridge-tops beyond such destructive\r\naction; for, where all the conditions are favorable, it is almost\r\nimperishable. _Now these historic ditches and root bowls occur in all\r\nthe present Sequoia groves and forests, but as far as I have observed,\r\nnot the faintest vestige of one presents itself outside of them_.\r\n\r\nWe therefore conclude that the area covered by Sequoia has not been\r\ndiminished during the last eight or ten thousand years, and probably\r\nnot at all in post-glacial times.\r\n\r\n_Is the species verging to extinction? What are its relations to\r\nclimate, soil, and associated trees?_\r\n\r\nAll the phenomena bearing on these questions also throw light, as we\r\nshall endeavor to show, upon the peculiar distribution of the species,\r\nand sustain the conclusion already arrived at on the question of\r\nextension.\r\n\r\nIn the northern groups, as we have seen, there are few young trees or\r\nsaplings growing up around the failing old ones to perpetuate the race,\r\nand in as much as those aged Sequoias, so nearly childless, are the\r\nonly ones commonly known, the species, to most observers, seems doomed\r\nto speedy extinction, as being nothing more than an expiring remnant,\r\nvanquished in the so-called struggle for life by pines and firs that\r\nhave driven it into its last strongholds in moist glens where climate\r\nis exceptionally favorable. But the language of the majestic continuous\r\nforests of the south creates a very different impression. No tree of\r\nall the forest is more enduringly established in concordance with\r\nclimate and soil. It grows heartily everywhere\xe2\x80\x94on moraines, rocky\r\nledges, along watercourses, and in the deep, moist alluvium of meadows,\r\nwith a multitude of seedlings and saplings crowding up around the aged,\r\nseemingly abundantly able to maintain the forest in prime vigor. For\r\nevery old storm-stricken tree, there is one or more in all the glory of\r\nprime; and for each of these many young trees and crowds of exuberant\r\nsaplings. So that if all the trees of any section of the main Sequoia\r\nforest were ranged together according to age, a very promising curve\r\nwould be presented, all the way up from last year\xe2\x80\x99s seedlings to\r\ngiants, and with the young and middle-aged portion of the curve many\r\ntimes longer than the old portion. Even as far north as the Fresno, I\r\ncounted 536 saplings and seedlings growing promisingly upon a piece of\r\nrough avalanche soil not exceeding two acres in area. This soil bed is\r\nabout seven years old, and has been seeded almost simultaneously by\r\npines, firs, Libocedrus, and Sequoia, presenting a simple and\r\ninstructive illustration of the struggle for life among the rival\r\nspecies; and it was interesting to note that the conditions thus far\r\naffecting them have enabled the young Sequoias to gain a marked\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nIn every instance like the above I have observed that the seedling\r\nSequoia is capable of growing on both drier and wetter soil than its\r\nrivals, but requires more sunshine than they; the latter fact being\r\nclearly shown wherever a Sugar Pine or fir is growing in close contact\r\nwith a Sequoia of about equal age and size, and equally exposed to the\r\nsun; the branches of the latter in such cases are always less leafy.\r\nToward the south, however, where the Sequoia becomes _more_ exuberant\r\nand numerous, the rival trees become _less_ so; and where they mix with\r\nSequoias, they mostly grow up beneath them, like slender grasses among\r\nstalks of Indian corn. Upon a bed of sandy flood-soil I counted\r\nninety-four Sequoias, from one to twelve feet high, on a patch, of\r\nground once occupied by four large Sugar Pines which lay crumbling\r\nbeneath them,\xe2\x80\x94an instance of conditions which have enabled Sequoias to\r\ncrowd out the pines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUIR GORGE, TUOLUMNE CA\xc3\x91ON\xe2\x80\x94YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK.]\r\n\r\nI also noted eighty-six vigorous saplings upon a piece of fresh ground\r\nprepared for their reception by fire. Thus fire, the great destroyer of\r\nSequoia, also furnishes bare virgin ground, one of the conditions\r\nessential for its growth from the seed. Fresh ground is, however,\r\nfurnished in sufficient quantities for the constant renewal of the\r\nforests without fire, viz., by the fall of old trees. The soil is thus\r\nupturned and mellowed, and many trees are planted for every one that\r\nfalls. Land-slips and floods also give rise to bare virgin ground; and\r\na tree now and then owes its existence to a burrowing wolf or squirrel,\r\nbut the most regular supply of fresh soil is furnished by the fall of\r\naged trees.\r\n\r\nThe climatic changes in progress in the Sierra, bearing on the tenure\r\nof tree life, are entirely misapprehended, especially as to the time\r\nand the means employed by Nature in effecting them. It is constantly\r\nasserted in a vague way that the Sierra was vastly wetter than now, and\r\nthat the increasing drought will of itself extinguish Sequoia, leaving\r\nits ground to other trees supposed capable of nourishing in a drier\r\nclimate. But that Sequoia can and does grow on as dry ground as any of\r\nits present rivals, is manifest in a thousand places. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, then,\xe2\x80\x9d it\r\nwill be asked, \xe2\x80\x9care Sequoias always found in greatest abundance in\r\nwell-watered places where streams are exceptionally abundant?\xe2\x80\x9d Simply\r\nbecause a growth of Sequoias creates those streams. The thirsty\r\nmountaineer knows well that in every Sequoia grove he will find running\r\nwater, but it is a mistake to suppose that the water is the cause of\r\nthe grove being there; on the contrary, the grove is the cause of the\r\nwater being there. Drain off the water and the trees will remain, but\r\ncut off the trees, and the streams will vanish. Never was cause more\r\ncompletely mistaken for effect than in the case of these related\r\nphenomena of Sequoia woods and perennial streams, and I confess that at\r\nfirst I shared in the blunder.\r\n\r\nWhen attention is called to the method of Sequoia stream-making, it\r\nwill be apprehended at once. The roots of this immense tree fill the\r\nground, forming a thick sponge that absorbs and holds back the rains\r\nand melting snows, only allowing them to ooze and flow gently. Indeed,\r\nevery fallen leaf and rootlet, as well as long clasping root, and\r\nprostrate trunk, may be regarded as a dam hoarding the bounty of\r\nstorm-clouds, and dispensing it as blessings all through the summer,\r\ninstead of allowing it to go headlong in short-lived floods.\r\nEvaporation is also checked by the dense foliage to a greater extent\r\nthan by any other Sierra tree, and the air is entangled in masses and\r\nbroad sheets that are quickly saturated; while thirsty winds are not\r\nallowed to go sponging and licking along the ground.\r\n\r\nSo great is the retention of water in many places in the main belt,\r\nthat bogs and meadows are created by the killing of the trees. A single\r\ntrunk falling across a stream in the woods forms a dam 200 feet long,\r\nand from ten to thirty feet high, giving rise to a pond which kills the\r\ntrees within its reach. These dead trees fall in turn, thus making a\r\nclearing, while sediments gradually accumulate changing the pond into a\r\nbog, or meadow, for a growth of carices and sphagnum. In some instances\r\na series of small bogs or meadows rise above one another on a hillside,\r\nwhich are gradually merged into one another, forming sloping bogs, or\r\nmeadows, which make striking features of Sequoia woods, and since all\r\nthe trees that have fallen into them have been preserved, they contain\r\nrecords of the generations that have passed since they began to form.\r\n\r\nSince, then, it is a fact that thousands of Sequoias are growing\r\nthriftily on what is termed dry ground, and even clinging like mountain\r\npines to rifts in granite precipices; and since it has also been shown\r\nthat the extra moisture found in connection with the denser growths is\r\nan effect of their presence, instead of a cause of their presence, then\r\nthe notions as to the former extension of the species and its near\r\napproach to extinction, based upon its supposed dependence on greater\r\nmoisture, are seen to be erroneous.\r\n\r\nThe decrease in the rain- and snow-fall since the close of the glacial\r\nperiod in the Sierra is much less than is commonly guessed. The highest\r\npost-glacial watermarks are well preserved in all the upper river\r\nchannels, and they are not greatly higher than the spring floodmarks of\r\nthe present; showing conclusively that no extraordinary decrease has\r\ntaken place in the volume of the upper tributaries of post-glacial\r\nSierra streams since they came into existence. But in the mean time,\r\neliminating all this complicated question of climatic change, the plain\r\nfact remains that _the present rain- and snow-fall is abundantly\r\nsufficient for the luxuriant growth of Sequoia forests_. Indeed, all my\r\nobservations tend to show that in a prolonged drought the Sugar Pines\r\nand firs would perish before the Sequoia, not alone because of the\r\ngreater longevity of individual trees, but because the species can\r\nendure more drought, and make the most of whatever moisture falls.\r\n\r\nAgain, if the restriction and irregular distribution of the species be\r\ninterpreted as a result of the desiccation of the range, then instead\r\nof increasing as it does in individuals toward the south where the\r\nrainfall is less, it should diminish.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the peculiar distribution of Sequoia has not been governed by\r\nsuperior conditions of soil as to fertility or moisture, by what has it\r\nbeen governed?\r\n\r\nIn the course of my studies I observed that the northern groves, the\r\nonly ones I was at first acquainted with, were located on just those\r\nportions of the general forest soil-belt that were first laid bare\r\ntoward the close of the glacial period when the ice-sheet began to\r\nbreak up into individual glaciers. And while searching the wide basin\r\nof the San Joaquin, and trying to account for the absence of Sequoia\r\nwhere every condition seemed favorable for its growth, it occured to me\r\nthat this remarkable gap in the Sequoia belt is located exactly in the\r\nbasin of the vast ancient _mer de glace_ of the San Joaquin and King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nRiver basins, which poured its frozen floods to the plain, fed by the\r\nsnows that fell on more than fifty miles of the summit. I then\r\nperceived that the next great gap in the belt to the northward, forty\r\nmiles wide, extending between the Calaveras and Tuolumne groves, occurs\r\nin the basin of the great ancient _mer de glace_ of the Tuolumne and\r\nStanislaus basins, and that the smaller gap between the Merced and\r\nMariposa groves occurs in the basin of the smaller glacier of the\r\nMerced. _The wider the ancient glacier, the wider the corresponding gap\r\nin the Sequoia belt_.\r\n\r\nFinally, pursuing my investigations across the basins of the Kaweah and\r\nTule, I discovered that the Sequoia belt attained its greatest\r\ndevelopment just where, owing to the topographical peculiarities of the\r\nregion, the ground had been most perfectly protected from the main\r\nice-rivers that continued to pour past from the summit fountains long\r\nafter the smaller local glaciers had been melted.\r\n\r\nTaking now a general view of the belt, beginning at the south, we see\r\nthat the majestic ancient glaciers were shed off right and left down\r\nthe valleys of Kern and King\xe2\x80\x99s rivers by the lofty protective spurs\r\noutspread embracingly above the warm Sequoia-filled basins of the\r\nKaweah and Tule. Then, next northward, occurs the wide Sequoia-less\r\nchannel, or basin, of the ancient San Joaquin and King\xe2\x80\x99s River _mer de\r\nglace_; then the warm, protected spots of Fresno and Mariposa groves;\r\nthen the Sequoia-less channel of the ancient Merced glacier; next the\r\nwarm, sheltered ground of the Merced and Tuolumne groves; then the\r\nSequoia-less channel of the grand ancient _mer de glace_ of the\r\nTuolumne and Stanislaus; then the warm old ground of the Calaveras and\r\nStanislaus groves. It appears, therefore, that just where, at a certain\r\nperiod in the history of the Sierra, the glaciers were not, there the\r\nSequoia is, and just where the glaciers were, there the Sequoia is not.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW IN TUOLUMNE CA\xc3\x91ON, YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK.]\r\n\r\nWhat the other conditions may have been that enabled Sequoia to\r\nestablish itself upon these oldest and warmest portions of the main\r\nglacial soil-belt, I cannot say. I might venture to state, however, in\r\nthis connection, that since the Sequoia forests present a more and more\r\nancient aspect as they extend southward, I am inclined to think that\r\nthe species was distributed from the south, while the Sugar Pine, its\r\ngreat rival in the northern groves, seems to have come around the head\r\nof the Sacramento valley and down the Sierra from the north;\r\nconsequently, when the Sierra soil-beds were first thrown open to\r\npreemption on the melting of the ice-sheet, the Sequoia may have\r\nestablished itself along the available portions of the south half of\r\nthe range prior to the arrival of the Sugar Pine, while the Sugar Pine\r\ntook possession of the north half prior to the arrival of Sequoia.\r\n\r\nBut however much uncertainty may attach to this branch of the question,\r\nthere are no obscuring shadows upon the grand general relationship we\r\nhave pointed out between the present distribution of Sequoia and the\r\nancient glaciers of the Sierra. And when we bear in mind that all the\r\npresent forests of the Sierra are young, growing on moraine soil\r\nrecently deposited, and that the flank of the range itself, with all\r\nits landscapes, is new-born, recently sculptured, and brought to the\r\nlight of day from beneath the ice mantle of the glacial winter, then a\r\nthousand lawless mysteries disappear, and broad harmonies take their\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nBut although all the observed phenomena bearing on the post-glacial\r\nhistory of this colossal tree point to the conclusion that it never was\r\nmore widely distributed on the Sierra since the close of the glacial\r\nepoch; that its present forests are scarcely past prime, if, indeed,\r\nthey have reached prime; that the post-glacial day of the species is\r\nprobably not half done; yet, when from a wider outlook the vast\r\nantiquity of the genus is considered, and its ancient richness in\r\nspecies and individuals; comparing our Sierra Giant and _Sequoia\r\nsempervirens_ of the Coast Range, the only other living species of\r\nSequoia, with the twelve fossil species already discovered and\r\ndescribed by Heer and Lesquereux, some of which seem to have flourished\r\nover vast areas in the Arctic regions and in Europe and our own\r\nterritories, during tertiary and cretaceous times,\xe2\x80\x94then indeed it\r\nbecomes plain that our two surviving species, restricted to narrow\r\nbelts within the limits of California, are mere remnants of the genus,\r\nboth as to species and individuals, and that they probably are verging\r\nto extinction. But the verge of a period beginning in cretaceous times\r\nmay have a breadth of tens of thousands of years, not to mention the\r\npossible existence of conditions calculated to multiply and re\xc3\xabxtend\r\nboth species and individuals. This, however, is a branch of the\r\nquestion into which I do not now purpose to enter.\r\n\r\nIn studying the fate of our forest king, we have thus far considered\r\nthe action of purely natural causes only; but, unfortunately, _man_ is\r\nin the woods, and waste and pure destruction are making rapid headway.\r\nIf the importance of forests were at all understood, even from an\r\neconomic standpoint, their preservation would call forth the most\r\nwatchful attention of government. Only of late years by means of forest\r\nreservations has the simplest groundwork for available legislation been\r\nlaid, while in many of the finest groves every species of destruction\r\nis still moving on with accelerated speed.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my explorations I found no fewer than five mills\r\nlocated on or near the lower edge of the Sequoia belt, all of which\r\nwere cutting considerable quantities of Big Tree lumber. Most of the\r\nFresno group are doomed to feed the mills recently erected near them,\r\nand a company of lumbermen are now cutting the magnificent forest on\r\nKing\xe2\x80\x99s River. In these milling operations waste far exceeds use, for\r\nafter the choice young manageable trees on any given spot have been\r\nfelled, the woods are fired to clear the ground of limbs and refuse\r\nwith reference to further operations, and, of course, most of the\r\nseedlings and saplings are destroyed.\r\n\r\nThese mill ravages, however, are small as compared with the\r\ncomprehensive destruction caused by \xe2\x80\x9csheepmen.\xe2\x80\x9d Incredible numbers of\r\nsheep are driven to the mountain pastures every summer, and their\r\ncourse is ever marked by desolation. Every wild garden is trodden down,\r\nthe shrubs are stripped of leaves as if devoured by locusts, and the\r\nwoods are burned. Running fires are set everywhere, with a view to\r\nclearing the ground of prostrate trunks, to facilitate the movements of\r\nthe flocks and improve the pastures. The entire forest belt is thus\r\nswept and devastated from one extremity of the range to the other, and,\r\nwith the exception of the resinous _Pinus contorta_, Sequoia suffers\r\nmost of all. Indians burn off the underbrush in certain localities to\r\nfacilitate deer-hunting, mountaineers and lumbermen carelessly allow\r\ntheir camp-fires to run; but the fires of the sheepmen, or\r\n_muttoneers_, form more than ninety per cent. of all destructive fires\r\nthat range the Sierra forests.\r\n\r\nIt appears, therefore, that notwithstanding our forest king might live\r\non gloriously in Nature\xe2\x80\x99s keeping, it is rapidly vanishing before the\r\nfire and steel of man; and unless protective measures be speedily\r\ninvented and applied, in a few decades, at the farthest, all that will\r\nbe left of _Sequoia gigantea_ will be a few hacked and scarred\r\nmonuments.\r\n\r\nTWO-LEAVED, OR TAMARACK, PINE\r\n(_Pinus contorta_, var._Marrayana_)\r\n\r\nThis species forms the bulk of the alpine forests, extending along the\r\nrange, above the fir zone, up to a height of from 8000 to 9500 feet\r\nabove the sea, growing in beautiful order upon moraines that are\r\nscarcely changed as yet by post-glacial weathering. Compared with the\r\ngiants of the lower zones, this is a small tree, seldom attaining a\r\nheight of a hundred feet. The largest specimen I ever measured was\r\nninety feet in height, and a little over six in diameter four feet from\r\nthe ground. The average height of mature trees throughout the entire\r\nbelt is probably not far from fifty or sixty feet, with a diameter of\r\ntwo feet. It is a well-proportioned, rather handsome little pine, with\r\ngrayish-brown bark, and crooked, much-divided branches, which cover the\r\ngreater portion of the trunk, not so densely, however, as to prevent\r\nits being seen. The lower limbs curve downward, gradually take a\r\nhorizontal position about half-way up the trunk, then aspire more and\r\nmore toward the summit, thus forming a sharp, conical top. The foliage\r\nis short and rigid, two leaves in a fascicle, arranged in comparatively\r\nlong, cylindrical tassels at the ends of the tough, up-curving\r\nbranchlets. The cones are about two inches long, growing in stiff\r\nclusters among the needles, without making any striking effect, except\r\nwhile very young, when they are of a vivid crimson color, and the whole\r\ntree appears to be dotted with brilliant flowers. The sterile cones are\r\nstill more showy, on account of their great abundance, often giving a\r\nreddish-yellow tinge to the whole mass of the foliage, and filling the\r\nair with pollen.\r\n\r\nNo other pine on the range is so regularly planted as this one. Moraine\r\nforests sweep along the sides of the high, rocky valleys for miles\r\nwithout interruption; still, strictly speaking, they are not dense, for\r\nflecks of sunshine and flowers find their way into the darkest places,\r\nwhere the trees grow tallest and thickest. Tall, nutritious grasses are\r\nspecially abundant beneath them, growing over all the ground, in\r\nsunshine and shade, over extensive areas like a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s crop, and\r\nserving as pasture for the multitude of sheep that are driven from the\r\narid plains every summer as soon as the snow is melted.\r\n\r\nThe Two-leaved Pine, more than any other, is subject to destruction by\r\nfire. The thin bark is streaked and sprinkled with resin, as though it\r\nhad been showered down upon it like rain, so that even the green trees\r\ncatch fire readily, and during strong winds whole forests are\r\ndestroyed, the flames leaping from tree to tree, forming one continuous\r\nbelt of roaring fire that goes surging and racing onward above the\r\nbending woods, like the grass-fires of a prairie. During the calm, dry\r\nseason of Indian summer, the fire creeps quietly along the ground,\r\nfeeding on the dry needles and burs; then, arriving at the foot of a\r\ntree, the resiny bark is ignited, and the heated air ascends in a\r\npowerful current, increasing in velocity, and dragging the flames\r\nswiftly upward; then the leaves catch fire, and an immense column of\r\nflame, beautifully spired on the edges, and tinted a rose-purple hue,\r\nrushes aloft thirty or forty feet above the top of the tree, forming a\r\ngrand spectacle, especially on a dark night. It lasts, however, only a\r\nfew seconds, vanishing with magical rapidity, to be succeeded by others\r\nalong the fire-line at irregular intervals for weeks at a time\xe2\x80\x94tree\r\nafter tree flashing and darkening, leaving the trunks and branches\r\nhardly scarred. The heat, however, is sufficient to kill the trees, and\r\nin a few years the bark shrivels and falls off. Belts miles in extent\r\nare thus killed and left standing with the branches on, peeled and\r\nrigid, appearing gray in the distance, like misty clouds. Later the\r\nbranches drop off, leaving a forest of bleached spars. At length the\r\nroots decay, and the forlorn trunks are blown down during some storm,\r\nand piled one upon another encumbering the ground until they are\r\nconsumed by the next fire, and leave it ready for a fresh crop.\r\n\r\nThe endurance of the species is shown by its wandering occasionally out\r\nover the lava plains with the Yellow Pine, and climbing moraineless\r\nmountain-sides with the Dwarf Pine, clinging to any chance support in\r\nrifts and crevices of storm-beaten rocks\xe2\x80\x94always, however, showing the\r\neffects of such hardships in every feature.\r\n\r\nDown in sheltered lake hollows, on beds of rich alluvium, it varies so\r\nfar from the common form as frequently to be taken for a distinct\r\nspecies. Here it grows in dense sods, like grasses, from forty to\r\neighty feet high, bending all together to the breeze and whirling in\r\neddying gusts more lithely than any other tree in the woods. I have\r\nfrequently found specimens fifty feet high less than five inches in\r\ndiameter. Being thus slender, and at the same time well clad with leafy\r\nboughs, it is oftentimes bent to the ground when laden with soft snow,\r\nforming beautiful arches in endless variety, some of which last until\r\nthe melting of the snow in spring.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAIN PINE\r\n(_Pinus monticola_)\r\n\r\nThe Mountain Pine is king of the alpine woods, brave, hardy, and\r\nlong-lived, towering grandly above its companions, and becoming\r\nstronger and more imposing just where other species begin to crouch and\r\ndisappear. At its best it is usually about ninety feet high and five or\r\nsix in diameter, though a specimen is often met considerably larger\r\nthan this. The trunk is as massive and as suggestive of enduring\r\nstrength as that of an oak. About two thirds of the trunk is commonly\r\nfree of limbs, but close, fringy tufts of sprays occur all the way\r\ndown, like those which adorn the colossal shafts of Sequoia. The bark\r\nis deep reddish-brown upon trees that occupy exposed situations near\r\nits upper limit, and furrowed rather deeply, the main furrows running\r\nnearly parallel with each other, and connected by conspicuous cross\r\nfurrows, which, with one exception, are, as far as I have noticed,\r\npeculiar to this species.\r\n\r\nThe cones are from four to eight inches long, slender, cylindrical, and\r\nsomewhat curved, resembling those of the common White Pine of the\r\nAtlantic coast. They grow in clusters of about from three to six or\r\nseven, becoming pendulous as they increase in weight, chiefly by the\r\nbending of the branches.\r\n\r\nThis species is nearly related to the Sugar Pine, and, though not half\r\nso tall, it constantly suggests its noble relative in the way that it\r\nextends its long arms and in general habit. The Mountain Pine is first\r\nmet on the upper margin of the fir zone, growing singly in a subdued,\r\ninconspicuous form, in what appear as chance situations, without making\r\nmuch impression on the general forest. Continuing up through the\r\nTwo-leaved Pines in the same scattered growth, it begins to show its\r\ncharacter, and at an elevation of about 10,000 feet attains its noblest\r\ndevelopment near the middle of the range, tossing its tough arms in the\r\nfrosty air, welcoming storms and feeding on them, and reaching the\r\ngrand old age of 1000 years.\r\n\r\nJUNIPER, OR RED CEDAR\r\n(_Juniperus occidentalis_)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUNIPER, OR RED CEDAR.]\r\n\r\nThe Juniper is pre\xc3\xabminently a rock tree, occupying the baldest domes\r\nand pavements, where there is scarcely a handful of soil, at a height\r\nof from 7000 to 9500 feet. In such situations the trunk is frequently\r\nover eight feet in diameter, and not much more in height. The top is\r\nalmost always dead in old trees, and great stubborn limbs push out\r\nhorizontally that are mostly broken and bare at the ends, but densely\r\ncovered and embedded here and there with bossy mounds of gray foliage.\r\nSome are mere weathered stumps, as broad as long, decorated with a few\r\nleafy sprays, reminding one of the crumbling towers of some ancient\r\ncastle scantily draped with ivy. Only upon the head waters of the\r\nCarson have I found this species established on good moraine soil. Here\r\nit flourishes with the Silver and Two-leaved Pines, in great beauty and\r\nluxuriance, attaining a height of from forty to sixty feet, and\r\nmanifesting but little of that rocky angularity so characteristic a\r\nfeature throughout the greater portion, of its range. Two of the\r\nlargest, growing at the head of Hope Valley, measured twenty-nine feet\r\nthree inches and twenty-five feet six inches in circumference,\r\nrespectively, four feet from the ground. The bark is of a bright\r\ncinnamon color, and, in thrifty trees, beautifully braided and\r\nreticulated, flaking off in thin, lustrous ribbons that are sometimes\r\nused by Indians for tent-matting. Its fine color and odd\r\npicturesqueness always catch an artist\xe2\x80\x99s eye, but to me the Juniper\r\nseems a singularly dull and taciturn tree, never speaking to one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart. I have spent many a day and night in its company, in all kinds\r\nof weather, and have ever found it silent, cold, and rigid, like a\r\ncolumn of ice. Its broad stumpiness, of course, precludes all\r\npossibility of waving, or even shaking; but it is not this rocky\r\nsteadfastness that constitutes its silence. In calm, sun-days the Sugar\r\nPine preaches the grandeur of the mountains like an apostle without\r\nmoving a leaf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STORM-BEATEN JUNIPERS.]\r\n\r\nOn level rocks it dies standing, and wastes insensibly out of existence\r\nlike granite, the wind exerting about as little control over it alive\r\nor dead as it does over a glacier boulder. Some are undoubtedly over\r\n2000 years old. All the trees of the alpine woods suffer, more or less,\r\nfrom avalanches, the Two-leaved Pine most of all. Gaps two or three\r\nhundred yards wide, extending from the upper limit of the tree-line to\r\nthe bottoms of valleys and lake basins, are of common occurrence in all\r\nthe upper forests, resembling the clearings of settlers in the old\r\nbackwoods. Scarcely a tree is spared, even the soil is scraped away,\r\nwhile the thousands of uprooted pines and spruces are piled upon one\r\nanother heads downward, and tucked snugly in along the sides of the\r\nclearing in two windrows, like lateral moraines. The pines lie with\r\nbranches wilted and drooping like weeds. Not so the burly junipers.\r\nAfter braving in silence the storms of perhaps a dozen or twenty\r\ncenturies, they seem in this, their last calamity, to become somewhat\r\ncommunicative, making sign of a very unwilling acceptance of their\r\nfate, holding themselves well up from the ground on knees and elbows,\r\nseemingly ill at ease, and anxious, like stubborn wrestlers, to rise\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nHEMLOCK SPRUCE\r\n(_Tsuga Pattoniana_)\r\n\r\nThe Hemlock Spruce is the most singularly beautiful of all the\r\nCalifornia coniferae. So slender is its axis at the top, that it bends\r\nover and droops like the stalk of a nodding lily. The branches droop\r\nalso, and divide into innumerable slender, waving sprays, which are\r\narranged in a varied, eloquent harmony that is wholly indescribable.\r\nIts cones are purple, and hang free, in the form of little tassels two\r\ninches long from all the sprays from top to bottom. Though exquisitely\r\ndelicate and feminine in expression, it grows best where the snow lies\r\ndeepest, far up in the region of storms, at an elevation of from 9000\r\nto 9500 feet, on frosty northern slopes; but it is capable of growing\r\nconsiderably higher, say 10,500 feet. The tallest specimens, growing in\r\nsheltered hollows somewhat beneath the heaviest wind-currents, are from\r\neighty to a hundred feet high, and from two to four feet in diameter.\r\nThe very largest specimen I ever found was nineteen feet seven inches\r\nin circumference four feet from the ground, growing on the edge of Lake\r\nHollow, at an elevation of 9250 feet above the level of the sea. At the\r\nage of twenty or thirty years it becomes fruitful, and hangs out its\r\nbeautiful purple cones at the ends of the slender sprays, where they\r\nswing free in the breeze, and contrast delightfully with the cool green\r\nfoliage. They are translucent when young, and their beauty is\r\ndelicious. After they are fully ripe, they spread their shell-like\r\nscales and allow the brown-winged seeds to fly in the mellow air, while\r\nthe empty cones remain to beautify the tree until the coming of a fresh\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STORM-BEATEN HEMLOCK SPRUCE, FORTY FEET HIGH.]\r\n\r\nThe staminate cones of all the coniferae are beautiful, growing in\r\nbright clusters, yellow, and rose, and crimson. Those of the Hemlock\r\nSpruce are the most beautiful of all, forming little conelets of blue\r\nflowers, each on a slender stem.\r\n\r\nUnder all conditions, sheltered or storm-beaten, well-fed or ill-fed,\r\nthis tree is singularly graceful in habit. Even at its highest limit\r\nupon exposed ridge-tops, though compelled to crouch in dense thickets,\r\nhuddled close together, as if for mutual protection, it still manages\r\nto throw out its sprays in irrepressible loveliness; while on\r\nwell-ground moraine soil it develops a perfectly tropical luxuriance of\r\nfoliage and fruit, and is the very loveliest tree in the forest; poised\r\nin thin white sunshine, clad with branches from head to foot, yet not\r\nin the faintest degree heavy or bunchy, it towers in unassuming\r\nmajesty, drooping as if unaffected with the aspiring tendencies of its\r\nrace, loving the ground while transparently conscious of heaven and\r\njoyously receptive of its blessings, reaching out its branches like\r\nsensitive tentacles, feeling the light and reveling in it. No other of\r\nour alpine conifers so finely veils its strength. Its delicate branches\r\nyield to the mountains\xe2\x80\x99 gentlest breath; yet is it strong to meet the\r\nwildest onsets of the gale,\xe2\x80\x94strong not in resistance, but compliance,\r\nbowing, snow-laden, to the ground, gracefully accepting burial month\r\nafter month in the darkness beneath the heavy mantle of winter.\r\n\r\nWhen the first soft snow begins to fall, the flakes lodge in the\r\nleaves, weighing down the branches against the trunk. Then the axis\r\nbends yet lower and lower, until the slender top touches the ground,\r\nthus forming a fine ornamental arch. The snow still falls lavishly, and\r\nthe whole tree is at length buried, to sleep and rest in its beautiful\r\ngrave as though dead. Entire groves of young trees, from ten to forty\r\nfeet high, are thus buried every winter like slender grasses. But, like\r\nthe violets and daisies which the heaviest snows crush not, they are\r\nsafe. It is as though this were only Nature\xe2\x80\x99s method of putting her\r\ndarlings to sleep instead of leaving them exposed to the biting storms\r\nof winter.\r\n\r\nThus warmly wrapped they await the summer resurrection. The snow\r\nbecomes soft in the sunshine, and freezes at night, making the mass\r\nhard and compact, like ice, so that during the months of April and May\r\nyou can ride a horse over the prostrate groves without catching sight\r\nof a single leaf. At length the down-pouring sunshine sets them free.\r\nFirst the elastic tops of the arches begin to appear, then one branch\r\nafter another, each springing loose with a gentle rustling sound, and\r\nat length the whole tree, with the assistance of the winds, gradually\r\nunbends and rises and settles back into its place in the warm air, as\r\ndry and feathery and fresh as young ferns just out of the coil.\r\n\r\nSome of the finest groves I have yet found are on the southern slopes\r\nof Lassen\xe2\x80\x99s Butte. There are also many charming companies on the head\r\nwaters of the Tuolumne, Merced, and San Joaquin, and, in general, the\r\nspecies is so far from being rare that you can scarcely fail to find\r\ngroves of considerable extent in crossing the range, choose what pass\r\nyou may. The Mountain Pine grows beside it, and more frequently the\r\ntwo-leaved species; but there are many beautiful groups, numbering 1000\r\nindividuals, or more, without a single intruder.\r\n\r\nI wish I had space to write more of the surpassing beauty of this\r\nfavorite spruce. Every tree-lover is sure to regard it with special\r\nadmiration; apathetic mountaineers, even, seeking only game or gold,\r\nstop to gaze on first meeting it, and mutter to themselves: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nmighty pretty tree,\xe2\x80\x9d some of them adding, \xe2\x80\x9cd\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94d pretty!\xe2\x80\x9d In autumn,\r\nwhen its cones are ripe, the little striped tamias, and the Douglas\r\nsquirrel, and the Clark crow make a happy stir in its groves. The deer\r\nlove to lie down beneath its spreading branches; bright streams from\r\nthe snow that is always near ripple through its groves, and bryanthus\r\nspreads precious carpets in its shade. But the best words only hint its\r\ncharms. Come to the mountains and see.\r\n\r\nDWARF PINE\r\n(_Pinus albicaulis_)\r\n\r\nThis species forms the extreme edge of the timber line throughout\r\nnearly the whole extent of the range on both flanks. It is first met\r\ngrowing in company with _Pinus contorta_, var. _Murrayana_, on the\r\nupper margin of the belt, as an erect tree from fifteen to thirty feet\r\nhigh and from one to two feet in thickness; thence it goes straggling\r\nup the flanks of the summit peaks, upon moraines or crumbling ledges,\r\nwherever it can obtain a foothold, to an elevation of from 10,000 to\r\n12,000 feet, where it dwarfs to a mass of crumpled, prostrate branches,\r\ncovered with slender, upright shoots, each tipped with a short,\r\nclose-packed tassel of leaves. The bark is smooth and purplish, in some\r\nplaces almost white. The fertile cones grow in rigid clusters upon the\r\nupper branches, dark chocolate in color while young, and bear beautiful\r\npearly seeds about the size of peas, most of which are eaten by two\r\nspecies of tamias and the notable Clark crow. The staminate cones occur\r\nin clusters, about an inch wide, down among the leaves, and, as they\r\nare colored bright rose-purple, they give rise to a lively, flowery\r\nappearance little looked for in such a tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROUP OF ERECT DWARF PINES.]\r\n\r\nPines are commonly regarded as sky-loving trees that must necessarily\r\naspire or die. This species forms a marked exception, creeping lowly,\r\nin compliance with the most rigorous demands of climate, yet enduring\r\nbravely to a more advanced age than many of its lofty relatives in the\r\nsun-lands below. Seen from a distance, it would never be taken for a\r\ntree of any kind. Yonder, for example, is Cathedral Peak, some three\r\nmiles away, with a scattered growth of this pine creeping like mosses\r\nover the roof and around the beveled edges of the north gable, nowhere\r\ngiving any hint of an ascending axis. When approached quite near it\r\nstill appears matted and heathy, and is so low that one experiences no\r\ngreat difficulty in walking over the top of it. Yet it is seldom\r\nabsolutely prostrate, at its lowest usually attaining a height of three\r\nor four feet, with a main trunk, and branches outspread and\r\nintertangled above it, as if in ascending they had been checked by a\r\nceiling, against which they had grown and been compelled to spread\r\nhorizontally. The winter snow is indeed such a ceiling, lasting half\r\nthe year; while the pressed, shorn surface is made yet smoother by\r\nviolent winds, armed with cutting sand-grains, that beat down any shoot\r\nthat offers to rise much above the general level, and carve the dead\r\ntrunks and branches in beautiful patterns.\r\n\r\nDuring stormy nights I have often camped snugly beneath the interlacing\r\narches of this little pine. The needles, which have accumulated for\r\ncenturies, make fine beds, a fact well known to other mountaineers,\r\nsuch as deer and wild sheep, who paw out oval hollows and lie beneath\r\nthe larger trees in safe and comfortable concealment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DWARF PINE.]\r\n\r\nThe longevity of this lowly dwarf is far greater than would be guessed.\r\nHere, for example, is a specimen, growing at an elevation of 10,700\r\nfeet, which seems as though it might be plucked up by the roots, for it\r\nis only three and a half inches in diameter, and its topmost tassel is\r\nhardly three feet above the ground. Cutting it half through and\r\ncounting the annual rings with the aid of a lens, we find its age to be\r\nno less than 255 years. Here is another telling specimen about the same\r\nheight, 426 years old, whose trunk is only six inches in diameter; and\r\none of its supple branchlets, hardly an eighth of an inch in diameter\r\ninside the bark, is seventy-five years old, and so filled with oily\r\nbalsam, and so well seasoned by storms, that we may tie it in knots\r\nlike a whip-cord.\r\n\r\nWHITE PINE\r\n(_Pinus flexilis_)\r\n\r\nThis species is widely distributed throughout the Rocky Mountains, and\r\nover all the higher of the many ranges of the Great Basin, between the\r\nWahsatch Mountains and the Sierra, where it is known as White Pine. In\r\nthe Sierra it is sparsely scattered along the eastern flank, from\r\nBloody Ca\xc3\xb1on southward nearly to the extremity of the range, opposite\r\nthe village of Lone Pine, nowhere forming any appreciable portion of\r\nthe general forest. From its peculiar position, in loose, straggling\r\nparties, it seems to have been derived from the Basin ranges to the\r\neastward, where it is abundant.\r\n\r\nIt is a larger tree than the Dwarf Pine. At an elevation of about 9000\r\nfeet above the sea, it often attains a height of forty or fifty feet,\r\nand a diameter of from three to five feet. The cones open freely when\r\nripe, and are twice as large as those of the _albicaulis_, and the\r\nfoliage and branches are more open, having a tendency to sweep out in\r\nfree, wild curves, like those of the Mountain Pine, to which it is\r\nclosely allied. It is seldom found lower than 9000 feet above\r\nsea-level, but from this elevation it pushes upward over the roughest\r\nledges to the extreme limit of tree-growth, where, in its dwarfed,\r\nstorm-crushed condition, it is more like the white-barked species.\r\n\r\nThroughout Utah and Nevada it is one of the principal timber-trees,\r\ngreat quantities being cut every year for the mines. The famous White\r\nPine Mining District, White Pine City, and the White Pine Mountains\r\nhave derived their names from it.\r\n\r\nNEEDLE PINE\r\n(_Pinus aristata_)\r\n\r\nThis species is restricted in the Sierra to the southern portion of the\r\nrange, about the head waters of Kings and Kern rivers, where it forms\r\nextensive forests, and in some places accompanies the Dwarf Pine to the\r\nextreme limit of tree-growth.\r\n\r\nIt is first met at an elevation of between 9000 and 10,000 feet, and\r\nruns up to 11,000 without seeming to suffer greatly from the climate or\r\nthe leanness of the soil. It is a much finer tree than the Dwarf Pine.\r\nInstead of growing in clumps and low, heathy mats, it manages in some\r\nway to maintain an erect position, and usually stands single. Wherever\r\nthe young trees are at all sheltered, they grow up straight and arrowy,\r\nwith delicately tapered bole, and ascending branches terminated with\r\nglossy, bottle-brush tassels. At middle age, certain limbs are\r\nspecialized and pushed far out for the bearing of cones, after the\r\nmanner of the Sugar Pine; and in old age these branches droop and cast\r\nabout in every direction, giving rise to very picturesque effects. The\r\ntrunk becomes deep brown and rough, like that of the Mountain Pine,\r\nwhile the young cones are of a strange, dull, blackish-blue color,\r\nclustered on the upper branches. When ripe they are from three to four\r\ninches long, yellowish brown, resembling in every way those of the\r\nMountain Pine. Excepting the Sugar Pine, no tree on the mountains is so\r\ncapable of individual expression, while in grace of form and movement\r\nit constantly reminds one of the Hemlock Spruce.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OAK GROWING AMONG YELLOW PINES.]\r\n\r\nThe largest specimen I measured was a little over five feet in diameter\r\nand ninety feet in height, but this is more than twice the ordinary\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nThis species is common throughout the Rocky Mountains and most of the\r\nshort ranges of the Great Basin, where it is called the Fox-tail Pine,\r\nfrom its long dense leaf-tassels. On the Hot Creek, White Pine, and\r\nGolden Gate ranges it is quite abundant. About a foot or eighteen\r\ninches of the ends of the branches is densely packed with stiff\r\noutstanding needles which radiate like an electric fox or squirrel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntail. The needles have a glossy polish, and the sunshine sifting\r\nthrough them makes them burn with silvery luster, while their number\r\nand elastic temper tell delightfully in the winds. This tree is here\r\nstill more original and picturesque than in the Sierra, far surpassing\r\nnot only its companion conifers in this respect, but also the most\r\nnoted of the lowland oaks. Some stand firmly erect, feathered with\r\nradiant tassels down to the ground, forming slender tapering towers of\r\nshining verdure; others, with two or three specialized branches pushed\r\nout at right angles to the trunk and densely clad with tasseled sprays,\r\ntake the form of beautiful ornamental crosses. Again in the same woods\r\nyou find trees that are made up of several boles united near the\r\nground, spreading at the sides in a plane parallel to the axis of the\r\nmountain, with the elegant tassels hung in charming order between them,\r\nmaking a harp held against the main wind lines where they are most\r\neffective in playing the grand storm harmonies. And besides these there\r\nare many variable arching forms, alone or in groups, with innumerable\r\ntassels drooping beneath the arches or radiant above them, and many\r\nlowly giants of no particular form that have braved the storms of a\r\nthousand years. But whether old or young, sheltered or exposed to the\r\nwildest gales, this tree is ever found irrepressibly and extravagantly\r\npicturesque, and offers a richer and more varied series of forms to the\r\nartist than any other conifer I know of.\r\n\r\nNUT PINE\r\n(_Pinus monophylla_)\r\n\r\nThe Nut Pine covers or rather dots the eastern flank of the Sierra, to\r\nwhich it is mostly restricted, in grayish, bush-like patches, from the\r\nmargin of the sage-plains to an elevation of from 7000 to 8000 feet.\r\n\r\nA more contentedly fruitful and unaspiring conifer could not be\r\nconceived. All the species we have been sketching make departures more\r\nor less distant from the typical spire form, but none goes so far as\r\nthis. Without any apparent exigency of climate or soil, it remains near\r\nthe ground, throwing out crooked, divergent branches like an orchard\r\napple-tree, and seldom pushes a single shoot higher than fifteen or\r\ntwenty feet above the ground.\r\n\r\nThe average thickness of the trunk is, perhaps, about ten or twelve\r\ninches. The leaves are mostly undivided, like round awls, instead of\r\nbeing separated, like those of other pines, into twos and threes and\r\nfives. The cones are green while growing, and are usually found over\r\nall the tree, forming quite a marked feature as seen against the\r\nbluish-gray foliage. They are quite small, only about two inches in\r\nlength, and give no promise of edible nuts; but when we come to open\r\nthem, we find that about half the entire bulk of the cone is made up of\r\nsweet, nutritious seeds, the kernels of which are nearly as large as\r\nthose of hazel-nuts.\r\n\r\nThis is undoubtedly the most important food-tree on the Sierra, and\r\nfurnishes the Mono, Carson, and Walker River Indians with more and\r\nbetter nuts than all the other species taken together. It is the\r\nIndians\xe2\x80\x99 own tree, and many a white man have they killed for cutting it\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nIn its development Nature seems to have aimed at the formation of as\r\ngreat a fruit-bearing surface as possible. Being so low and accessible,\r\nthe cones are readily beaten off with poles, and the nuts procured by\r\nroasting them until the scales open. In bountiful seasons a single\r\nIndian will gather thirty or forty bushels of them\xe2\x80\x94a fine squirrelish\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\nOf all the conifers along the eastern base of the Sierra, and on all\r\nthe many mountain groups and short ranges of the Great Basin, this\r\nfoodful little pine is the commonest tree, and the most important.\r\nNearly every mountain is planted with it to a height of from 8000 to\r\n9000 feet above the sea. Some are covered from base to summit by this\r\none species, with only a sparse growth of juniper on the lower slopes\r\nto break the continuity of its curious woods, which, though\r\ndark-looking at a distance, are almost shadeless, and have none of the\r\ndamp, leafy glens and hollows so characteristic of other pine woods.\r\nTens of thousands of acres occur in continuous belts. Indeed, viewed\r\ncomprehensively the entire Basin seems to be pretty evenly divided into\r\nlevel plains dotted with sage-bushes and mountain-chains covered with\r\nNut Pines. No slope is too rough, none too dry, for these bountiful\r\norchards of the red man.\r\n\r\nThe value of this species to Nevada is not easily overestimated. It\r\nfurnishes charcoal and timber for the mines, and, with the juniper,\r\nsupplies the ranches with fuel and rough fencing. In fruitful seasons\r\nthe nut crop is perhaps greater than the California wheat crop, which\r\nexerts so much influence throughout the food markets of the world.\r\nWhen, the crop is ripe, the Indians make ready the long beating-poles;\r\nbags, baskets, mats, and sacks are collected; the women out at service\r\namong the settlers, washing or drudging, assemble at the family huts;\r\nthe men leave their ranch work; old and young, all are mounted on\r\nponies and start in great glee to the nut-lands, forming curiously\r\npicturesque cavalcades; flaming scarfs and calico skirts stream loosely\r\nover the knotty ponies, two squaws usually astride of each, with baby\r\nmidgets bandaged in baskets slung on their backs or balanced on the\r\nsaddle-bow; while nut-baskets and water-jars project from each side,\r\nand the long beating-poles make angles in every direction. Arriving at\r\nsome well-known central point where grass and water are found, the\r\nsquaws with baskets, the men with poles ascend the ridges to the laden\r\ntrees, followed by the children. Then the beating begins right merrily,\r\nthe burs fly in every direction, rolling down the slopes, lodging here\r\nand there against rocks and sage-bushes, chased and gathered by the\r\nwomen and children with fine natural gladness. Smoke-columns speedily\r\nmark the joyful scene of their labors as the roasting-fires are\r\nkindled, and, at night, assembled in gay circles garrulous as jays,\r\nthey begin the first nut feast of the season.\r\n\r\nThe nuts are about half an inch long and a quarter of an inch in\r\ndiameter, pointed at the top, round at the base, light brown in general\r\ncolor, and, like many other pine seeds, handsomely dotted with purple,\r\nlike birds\xe2\x80\x99 eggs. The shells are thin and may be crushed between the\r\nthumb and finger. The kernels are white, becoming brown by roasting,\r\nand are sweet to every palate, being eaten by birds, squirrels, dogs,\r\nhorses, and men. Perhaps less than one bushel in a thousand of the\r\nwhole crop is ever gathered. Still, besides supplying their own wants,\r\nin times of plenty the Indians bring large quantities to market; then\r\nthey are eaten around nearly every fireside in the State, and are even\r\nfed to horses occasionally instead of barley.\r\n\r\nOf other trees growing on the Sierra, but forming a very small part of\r\nthe general forest, we may briefly notice the following:\r\n\r\n_Chamoecyparis Lawsoniana_ is a magnificent tree in the coast ranges,\r\nbut small in the Sierra. It is found only well to the northward along\r\nthe banks of cool streams on the upper Sacramento toward Mount Shasta.\r\nOnly a few trees of this species, as far as I have seen, have as yet\r\ngained a place in the Sierra woods. It has evidently been derived from\r\nthe coast range by way of the tangle of connecting mountains at the\r\nhead of the Sacramento Valley.\r\n\r\nIn shady dells and on cool stream banks of the northern Sierra we also\r\nfind the Yew (_Taxus brevifolia_).\r\n\r\nThe interesting Nutmeg Tree (_Torreya Californica_) is sparsely\r\ndistributed along the western flank of the range at an elevation of\r\nabout 4000 feet, mostly in gulches and ca\xc3\xb1ons. It is a small, prickly\r\nleaved, glossy evergreen, like a conifer, from twenty to fifty feet\r\nhigh, and one to two feet in diameter. The fruit resembles a green-gage\r\nplum, and contains one seed, about the size of an acorn, and like a\r\nnutmeg, hence the common name. The wood is fine-grained and of a\r\nbeautiful, creamy yellow color like box, sweet-scented when dry, though\r\nthe green leaves emit a disagreeable odor.\r\n\r\n_Betula occidentalis_, the only birch, is a small, slender tree\r\nrestricted to the eastern flank of the range along stream-sides below\r\nthe pine-belt, especially in Owen\xe2\x80\x99s Valley.\r\n\r\nAlder, Maple, and Nuttall\xe2\x80\x99s Flowering Dogwood make beautiful bowers\r\nover swift, cool streams at an elevation of from 3000 to 5000 feet,\r\nmixed more or less with willows and cottonwood; and above these in lake\r\nbasins the aspen forms fine ornamental groves, and lets its light shine\r\ngloriously in the autumn months.\r\n\r\nThe Chestnut Oak (_Quercus densiflora_) seems to have come from the\r\ncoast range around the head of the Sacramento Valley, like the\r\n_Chamaecyparis_, but as it extends southward along the lower edge of\r\nthe main pine-belt it grows smaller until it finally dwarfs to a mere\r\nchaparral bush. In the coast mountains it is a fine, tall, rather\r\nslender tree, about from sixty to seventy-five feet high, growing with\r\nthe grand _Sequoia sempervirens_, or Redwood. But unfortunately it is\r\ntoo good to live, and is now being rapidly destroyed for tan-bark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PATE VALLEY, SHOWING THE OAKS. TUOLUMNE CA\xc3\x91ON, YOSEMITE\r\nNATIONAL PARK.]\r\n\r\nBesides the common Douglas Oak and the grand _Quercus Wislizeni_ of the\r\nfoot-hills, and several small ones that make dense growths of\r\nchaparral, there are two mountain-oaks that grow with the pines up to\r\nan elevation of about 5000 feet above the sea, and greatly enhance the\r\nbeauty of the yosemite parks. These are the Mountain Live Oak and the\r\nKellogg Oak, named in honor of the admirable botanical pioneer of\r\nCalifornia. Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s Oak (_Quercus Kelloggii_) is a firm, bright,\r\nbeautiful tree, reaching a height of sixty feet, four to seven feet in\r\ndiameter, with wide-spreading branches, and growing at an elevation of\r\nfrom 3000 to 5000 feet in sunny valleys and flats among the evergreens,\r\nand higher in a dwarfed state. In the cliff-bound parks about 4000 feet\r\nabove the sea it is so abundant and effective it might fairly be called\r\nthe Yosemite Oak. The leaves make beautiful masses of purple in the\r\nspring, and yellow in ripe autumn; while its acorns are eagerly\r\ngathered by Indians, squirrels, and woodpeckers. The Mountain Live Oak\r\n(_Q. Chrysolepis_) is a tough, rugged mountaineer of a tree, growing\r\nbravely and attaining noble dimensions on the roughest earthquake\r\ntaluses in deep ca\xc3\xb1ons and yosemite valleys. The trunk is usually\r\nshort, dividing near the ground into great, wide-spreading limbs, and\r\nthese again into a multitude of slender sprays, many of them cord-like\r\nand drooping to the ground, like those of the Great White Oak of the\r\nlowlands (_Q. lobata_). The top of the tree where there is plenty of\r\nspace is broad and bossy, with a dense covering of shining leaves,\r\nmaking delightful canopies, the complicated system of gray,\r\ninterlacing, arching branches as seen from beneath being exceedingly\r\nrich and picturesque. No other tree that I know dwarfs so regularly and\r\ncompletely as this under changes of climate due to changes in\r\nelevation. At the foot of a ca\xc3\xb1on 4000 feet above the sea you may find\r\nmagnificent specimens of this oak fifty feet high, with craggy, bulging\r\ntrunks, five to seven feet in diameter, and at the head of the ca\xc3\xb1on,\r\n2500 feet higher, a dense, soft, low, shrubby growth of the same\r\nspecies, while all the way up the ca\xc3\xb1on between these extremes of size\r\nand habit a perfect gradation may be traced. The largest I have seen\r\nwas fifty feet high, eight feet in diameter, and about seventy-five\r\nfeet in spread. The trunk was all knots and buttresses, gray like\r\ngranite, and about as angular and irregular as the boulders on which it\r\nwas growing\xe2\x80\x94a type of steadfast, unwedgeable strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\nTHE DOUGLAS SQUIRREL\r\n(_Sciurus Douglasii_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Douglas Squirrel is by far the most interesting and influential of\r\nthe California sciuridae, surpassing every other species in force of\r\ncharacter, numbers, and extent of range, and in the amount of influence\r\nhe brings to bear upon the health and distribution of the vast forests\r\nhe inhabits.\r\n\r\nGo where you will throughout the noble woods of the Sierra Nevada,\r\namong the giant pines and spruces of the lower zones, up through the\r\ntowering Silver Firs to the storm-bent thickets of the summit peaks,\r\nyou everywhere find this little squirrel the master-existence. Though\r\nonly a few inches long, so intense is his fiery vigor and restlessness,\r\nhe stirs every grove with wild life, and makes himself more important\r\nthan even the huge bears that shuffle through the tangled underbrush\r\nbeneath him. Every wind is fretted by his voice, almost every bole and\r\nbranch feels the sting of his sharp feet. How much the growth of the\r\ntrees is stimulated by this means it is not easy to learn, but his\r\naction in manipulating their seeds is more appreciable. Nature has made\r\nhim master forester and committed most of her coniferous crops to his\r\npaws. Probably over fifty per cent. of all the cones ripened on the\r\nSierra are cut off and handled by the Douglas alone, and of those of\r\nthe Big Trees perhaps ninety per cent. pass through his hands: the\r\ngreater portion is of course stored away for food to last during the\r\nwinter and spring, but some of them are tucked separately into loosely\r\ncovered holes, where some of the seeds germinate and become trees. But\r\nthe Sierra is only one of the many provinces over which he holds sway,\r\nfor his dominion extends over all the Redwood Belt of the Coast\r\nMountains, and far northward throughout the majestic forests of Oregon,\r\nWashington, and British Columbia. I make haste to mention these facts,\r\nto show upon how substantial a foundation the importance I ascribe to\r\nhim rests.\r\n\r\nThe Douglas is closely allied to the Red Squirrel or Chickaree of the\r\neastern woods. Ours may be a lineal descendant of this species,\r\ndistributed westward to the Pacific by way of the Great Lakes and the\r\nRocky Mountains, and thence southward along our forested ranges. This\r\nview is suggested by the fact that our species becomes redder and more\r\nChickaree-like in general, the farther it is traced back along the\r\ncourse indicated above. But whatever their relationship, and the\r\nevolutionary forces that have acted upon them, the Douglas is now the\r\nlarger and more beautiful animal.\r\n\r\nFrom the nose to the root of the tail he measures about eight inches;\r\nand his tail, which he so effectively uses in interpreting his\r\nfeelings, is about six inches in length. He wears dark bluish-gray over\r\nthe back and half-way down the sides, bright buff on the belly, with a\r\nstripe of dark gray, nearly black, separating the upper and under\r\ncolors; this dividing stripe, however, is not very sharply defined. He\r\nhas long black whiskers, which gives him a rather fierce look when\r\nobserved closely, strong claws, sharp as fish-hooks, and the brightest\r\nof bright eyes, full of telling speculation.\r\n\r\nA King\xe2\x80\x99s River Indian told me that they call him \xe2\x80\x9cPillillooeet,\xe2\x80\x9d which,\r\nrapidly pronounced with the first syllable heavily accented, is not\r\nunlike the lusty exclamation he utters on his way up a tree when\r\nexcited. Most mountaineers in California call him the Pine Squirrel;\r\nand when I asked an old trapper whether he knew our little forester, he\r\nreplied with brightening countenance: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, of course I know him;\r\neverybody knows him. When I\xe2\x80\x99m huntin\xe2\x80\x99 in the woods, I often find out\r\nwhere the deer are by his barkin\xe2\x80\x99 at \xe2\x80\x99em. I call \xe2\x80\x99em Lightnin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nSquirrels, because they\xe2\x80\x99re so mighty quick and peert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the true squirrels are more or less birdlike in speech and\r\nmovements; but the Douglas is pre\xc3\xabminently so, possessing, as he does,\r\nevery attribute peculiarly squirrelish enthusiastically concentrated.\r\nHe is the squirrel of squirrels, flashing from branch to branch of his\r\nfavorite evergreens crisp and glossy and undiseased as a sunbeam. Give\r\nhim wings and he would outfly any bird in the woods. His big gray\r\ncousin is a looser animal, seemingly light enough to float on the wind;\r\nyet when leaping from limb to limb, or out of one tree-top to another,\r\nhe sometimes halts to gather strength, as if making efforts concerning\r\nthe upshot of which he does not always feel exactly confident. But the\r\nDouglas, with his denser body, leaps and glides in hidden strength,\r\nseemingly as independent of common muscles as a mountain stream. He\r\nthreads the tasseled branches of the pines, stirring their needles like\r\na rustling breeze; now shooting across openings in arrowy lines; now\r\nlaunching in curves, glinting deftly from side to side in sudden\r\nzigzags, and swirling in giddy loops and spirals around the knotty\r\ntrunks; getting into what seem to be the most impossible situations\r\nwithout sense of danger; now on his haunches, now on his head; yet ever\r\ngraceful, and punctuating his most irrepressible outbursts of energy\r\nwith little dots and dashes of perfect repose. He is, without\r\nexception, the wildest animal I ever saw,\xe2\x80\x94a fiery, sputtering little\r\nbolt of life, luxuriating in quick oxygen and the woods\xe2\x80\x99 best juices.\r\nOne can hardly think of such a creature being dependent, like the rest\r\nof us, on climate and food. But, after all, it requires no long\r\nacquaintance to learn he is human, for he works for a living. His\r\nbusiest time is in the Indian summer. Then he gathers burs and\r\nhazel-nuts like a plodding farmer, working continuously every day for\r\nhours; saying not a word; cutting off the ripe cones at the top of his\r\nspeed, as if employed by the job, and examining every branch in regular\r\norder, as if careful that not one should escape him; then, descending,\r\nhe stores them away beneath logs and stumps, in anticipation of the\r\npinching hunger days of winter. He seems himself a kind of coniferous\r\nfruit,\xe2\x80\x94both fruit and flower. The resiny essences of the pines pervade\r\nevery pore of his body, and eating his flesh is like chewing gum.\r\n\r\nOne never tires of this bright chip of nature,\xe2\x80\x94this brave little voice\r\ncrying in the wilderness,\xe2\x80\x94of observing his many works and ways, and\r\nlistening to his curious language. His musical, piny gossip is as\r\nsavory to the ear as balsam to the palate; and, though he has not\r\nexactly the gift of song, some of his notes are as sweet as those of a\r\nlinnet\xe2\x80\x94almost flute-like in softness, while others prick and tingle\r\nlike thistles. He is the mocking-bird of squirrels, pouring forth mixed\r\nchatter and song like a perennial fountain; barking like a dog,\r\nscreaming like a hawk, chirping like a blackbird or a sparrow; while in\r\nbluff, audacious noisiness he is a very jay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRACK OF DOUGLAS SQUIRREL ONCE DOWN AND UP A PINE-TREE\r\nWHEN SHOWING OFF TO A SPECTATOR.]\r\n\r\nIn descending the trunk of a tree with the intention of alighting on\r\nthe ground, he preserves a cautious silence, mindful, perhaps, of foxes\r\nand wildcats; but while rocking safely at home in the pine-tops there\r\nis no end to his capers and noise; and woe to the gray squirrel or\r\nchipmunk that ventures to set foot on his favorite tree! No matter how\r\nslyly they trace the furrows of the bark, they are speedily discovered,\r\nand kicked down-stairs with comic vehemence, while a torrent of angry\r\nnotes comes rushing from his whiskered lips that sounds remarkably like\r\nswearing. He will even attempt at times to drive away dogs and men,\r\nespecially if he has had no previous knowledge of them. Seeing a man\r\nfor the first time, he approaches nearer and nearer, until within a few\r\nfeet; then, with an angry outburst, he makes a sudden rush, all teeth\r\nand eyes, as if about to eat you up. But, finding that the big, forked\r\nanimal doesn\xe2\x80\x99t scare, he prudently beats a retreat, and sets himself up\r\nto reconnoiter on some overhanging branch, scrutinizing every movement\r\nyou make with ludicrous solemnity. Gathering courage, he ventures down\r\nthe trunk again, churring and chirping, and jerking nervously up and\r\ndown in curious loops, eyeing you all the time, as if snowing off and\r\ndemanding your admiration. Finally, growing calmer, he settles down in\r\na comfortable posture on some horizontal branch commanding a good view,\r\nand beats time with his tail to a steady \xe2\x80\x9cChee-up! chee-up!\xe2\x80\x9d or, when\r\nsomewhat less excited, \xe2\x80\x9cPee-ah!\xe2\x80\x9d with the first syllable keenly\r\naccented, and the second drawn out like the scream of a hawk,\xe2\x80\x94repeating\r\nthis slowly and more emphatically at first, then gradually faster,\r\nuntil a rate of about 150 words a minute is reached; usually sitting\r\nall the time on his haunches, with paws resting on his breast, which\r\npulses visibly with each word. It is remarkable, too, that, though\r\narticulating distinctly, he keeps his mouth shut most of the time, and\r\nspeaks through his nose. I have occasionally observed him even eating\r\nSequoia seeds and nibbling a troublesome flea, without ceasing or in\r\nany way confusing his \xe2\x80\x9cPee-ah! pee-ah!\xe2\x80\x9d for a single moment.\r\n\r\nWhile ascending trees all his claws come into play, but in descending\r\nthe weight of his body is sustained chiefly by those of the hind feet;\r\nstill in neither case do his movements suggest effort, though if you\r\nare near enough you may see the bulging strength of his short,\r\nbear-like arms, and note his sinewy fists clinched in the bark.\r\n\r\nWhether going up or down, he carries his tail extended at full length\r\nin line with his body, unless it be required for gestures. But while\r\nrunning along horizontal limbs or fallen trunks, it is frequently\r\nfolded forward over the back, with the airy tip daintily upcurled. In\r\ncool weather it keeps him warm. Then, after he has finished his meal,\r\nyou may see him crouched close on some level limb with his tail-robe\r\nneatly spread and reaching forward to his ears, the electric,\r\noutstanding hairs quivering in the breeze like pine-needles. But in wet\r\nor very cold weather he stays in his nest, and while curled up there\r\nhis comforter is long enough to come forward around his nose. It is\r\nseldom so cold, however, as to prevent his going out to his stores when\r\nhungry.\r\n\r\nOnce as I lay storm-bound on the upper edge of the timber line on Mount\r\nShasta, the thermometer nearly at zero and the sky thick with driving\r\nsnow, a Douglas came bravely out several times from one of the lower\r\nhollows of a Dwarf Pine near my camp, faced the wind without seeming to\r\nfeel it much, frisked lightly about over the mealy snow, and dug his\r\nway down to some hidden seeds with wonderful precision, as if to his\r\neyes the thick snow-covering were glass.\r\n\r\nNo other of the Sierra animals of my acquaintance is better fed, not\r\neven the deer, amid abundance of sweet herbs and shrubs, or the\r\nmountain sheep, or omnivorous bears. His food consists of grass-seeds,\r\nberries, hazel-nuts, chinquapins, and the nuts and seeds of all the\r\nconiferous trees without exception,\xe2\x80\x94Pine, Fir, Spruce, Libocedrus,\r\nJuniper, and Sequoia,\xe2\x80\x94he is fond of them all, and they all agree with\r\nhim, green or ripe. No cone is too large for him to manage, none so\r\nsmall as to be beneath his notice. The smaller ones, such as those of\r\nthe Hemlock, and the Douglas Spruce, and the Two-leaved Pine, he cuts\r\noff and eats on a branch of the tree, without allowing them to fall;\r\nbeginning at the bottom of the cone and cutting away the scales to\r\nexpose the seeds; not gnawing by guess, like a bear, but turning them\r\nround and round in regular order, in compliance with their spiral\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nWhen thus employed, his location in the tree is betrayed by a dribble\r\nof scales, shells, and seed-wings, and, every few minutes, by the fall\r\nof the stripped axis of the cone. Then of course he is ready for\r\nanother, and if you are watching you may catch a glimpse of him as he\r\nglides silently out to the end of a branch and see him examining the\r\ncone-clusters until he finds one to his mind; then, leaning over, pull\r\nback the springy needles out of his way, grasp the cone with his paws\r\nto prevent its falling, snip it off in an incredibly short time, seize\r\nit with jaws grotesquely stretched, and return to his chosen seat near\r\nthe trunk. But the immense size of the cones of the Sugar Pine\xe2\x80\x94from\r\nfifteen to twenty inches in length\xe2\x80\x94and those of the Jeffrey variety of\r\nthe Yellow Pine compel him to adopt a quite different method. He cuts\r\nthem off without attempting to hold them, then goes down and drags them\r\nfrom where they have chanced to fall up to the bare, swelling ground\r\naround the instep of the tree, where he demolishes them in the same\r\nmethodical way, beginning at the bottom and following the scale-spirals\r\nto the top.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEEDS, WINGS, AND SCALE OF SUGAR PINE. (NAT. SIZE.)]\r\n\r\nFrom a single Sugar Pine cone he gets from two to four hundred seeds\r\nabout half the size of a hazel-nut, so that in a few minutes he can\r\nprocure enough to last a week. He seems, however, to prefer those of\r\nthe two Silver First above all others; perhaps because they are most\r\neasily obtained, as the scales drop off when ripe without needing to be\r\ncut. Both species are filled with an exceedingly pungent, aromatic oil,\r\nwhich spices all his flesh, and is of itself sufficient to account for\r\nhis lightning energy.\r\n\r\nYou may easily know this little workman by his chips. On sunny\r\nhillsides around the principal trees they lie in big piles,\xe2\x80\x94bushels and\r\nbasketfuls of them, all fresh and clean, making the most beautiful\r\nkitchen-middens imaginable. The brown and yellow scales and nut-shells\r\nare as abundant and as delicately penciled and tinted as the shells\r\nalong the sea-shore; while the beautiful red and purple seed-wings\r\nmingled with them would lead one to fancy that innumerable butterflies\r\nhad there met their fate.\r\n\r\nHe feasts on all the species long before they are ripe, but is wise\r\nenough to wait until they are matured before he gathers them into his\r\nbarns. This is in October and November, which with him are the two\r\nbusiest months of the year. All kinds of burs, big and little, are now\r\ncut off and showered down alike, and the ground is speedily covered\r\nwith them. A constant thudding and bumping is kept up; some of the\r\nlarger cones chancing to fall on old logs make the forest re\xc3\xabcho with\r\nthe sound. Other nut-eaters less industrious know well what is going\r\non, and hasten to carry away the cones as they fall. But however busy\r\nthe harvester may be, he is not slow to descry the pilferers below, and\r\ninstantly leaves his work to drive them away. The little striped tamias\r\nis a thorn in his flesh, stealing persistently, punish him as he may.\r\nThe large Gray Squirrel gives trouble also, although the Douglas has\r\nbeen accused of stealing from him. Generally, however, just the\r\nopposite is the case.\r\n\r\nThe excellence of the Sierra evergreens is well known to nurserymen\r\nthroughout the world, consequently there is considerable demand for the\r\nseeds. The greater portion of the supply has hitherto been procured by\r\nchopping down the trees in the more accessible sections of the forest\r\nalongside of bridle-paths that cross the range. Sequoia seeds at first\r\nbrought from twenty to thirty dollars per pound, and therefore were\r\neagerly sought after. Some of the smaller fruitful trees were cut down\r\nin the groves not protected by government, especially those of Fresno\r\nand King\xe2\x80\x99s River. Most of the Sequoias, however, are of so gigantic a\r\nsize that the seedsmen have to look for the greater portion of their\r\nsupplies to the Douglas, who soon learns he is no match for these\r\nfreebooters. He is wise enough, however, to cease working the instant\r\nhe perceives them, and never fails to embrace every opportunity to\r\nrecover his burs whenever they happen to be stored in any place\r\naccessible to him, and the busy seedsman often finds on returning to\r\ncamp that the little Douglas has exhaustively spoiled the spoiler. I\r\nknow one seed-gatherer who, whenever he robs the squirrels, scatters\r\nwheat or barley beneath the trees as conscience-money.\r\n\r\nThe want of appreciable life remarked by so many travelers in the\r\nSierra forests is never felt at this time of year. Banish all the\r\nhumming insects and the birds and quadrupeds, leaving only Sir Douglas,\r\nand the most solitary of our so-called solitudes would still throb with\r\nardent life. But if you should go impatiently even into the most\r\npopulous of the groves on purpose to meet him, and walk about looking\r\nup among the branches, you would see very little of him. But lie down\r\nat the foot of one of the trees and straightway he will come. For, in\r\nthe midst of the ordinary forest sounds, the falling of burs, piping of\r\nquails, the screaming of the Clark Crow, and the rustling of deer and\r\nbears among the chaparral, he is quick to detect your strange\r\nfootsteps, and will hasten to make a good, close inspection of you as\r\nsoon as you are still. First, you may hear him sounding a few notes of\r\ncurious inquiry, but more likely the first intimation of his approach\r\nwill be the prickly sounds of his feet as he descends the tree\r\noverhead, just before he makes his savage onrush to frighten you and\r\nproclaim your presence to every squirrel and bird in the neighborhood.\r\nIf you remain perfectly motionless, he will come nearer and nearer, and\r\nprobably set your flesh a-tingle by frisking across your body. Once,\r\nwhile I was seated at the foot of a Hemlock Spruce in one of the most\r\ninaccessible of the San Joaquin yosemites engaged in sketching, a\r\nreckless fellow came up behind me, passed under my bended arm, and\r\njumped on my paper. And one warm afternoon, while an old friend of mine\r\nwas reading out in the shade of his cabin, one of his Douglas neighbors\r\njumped from the gable upon his head, and then with admirable assurance\r\nran down over his shoulder and on to the book he held in his hand.\r\n\r\nOur Douglas enjoys a large social circle; for, besides his numerous\r\nrelatives, _Sciurus fossor, Tamias quadrivitatus, T. Townsendii,\r\nSpermophilus Beccheyi, S. Douglasii_, he maintains intimate relations\r\nwith the nut-eating birds, particularly the Clark Crow (_Picicorvus\r\ncolumbianus_) and the numerous woodpeckers and jays. The two\r\nspermophiles are astonishingly abundant in the lowlands and lower\r\nfoot-hills, but more and more sparingly distributed up through the\r\nDouglas domains,\xe2\x80\x94seldom venturing higher than six or seven thousand\r\nfeet above the level of the sea. The gray sciurus ranges but little\r\nhigher than this. The little striped tamias alone is associated with\r\nhim everywhere. In the lower and middle zones, where they all meet,\r\nthey are tolerably harmonious\xe2\x80\x94a happy family, though very amusing\r\nskirmishes may occasionally be witnessed. Wherever the ancient glaciers\r\nhave spread forest soil there you find our wee hero, most abundant\r\nwhere depth of soil and genial climate have given rise to a\r\ncorresponding luxuriance in the trees, but following every kind of\r\ngrowth up the curving moraines to the highest glacial fountains.\r\n\r\nThough I cannot of course expect all my readers to sympathize fully in\r\nmy admiration of this little animal, few, I hope, will think this\r\nsketch of his life too long. I cannot begin to tell here how much he\r\nhas cheered my lonely wanderings during all the years I have been\r\npursuing my studies in these glorious wilds; or how much unmistakable\r\nhumanity I have found in him. Take this for example: One calm, creamy\r\nIndian summer morning, when the nuts were ripe, I was camped in the\r\nupper pine-woods of the south fork of the San Joaquin, where the\r\nsquirrels seemed to be about as plentiful as the ripe burs. They were\r\ntaking an early breakfast before going to their regular harvest-work.\r\nWhile I was busy with my own breakfast I heard the thudding fall of two\r\nor three heavy cones from a Yellow Pine near me. I stole noiselessly\r\nforward within about twenty feet of the base of it to observe. In a few\r\nmoments down came the Douglas. The breakfast-burs he had cut off had\r\nrolled on the gently sloping ground into a clump of ceanothus bushes,\r\nbut he seemed to know exactly where they were, for he found them at\r\nonce, apparently without searching for them. They were more than twice\r\nas heavy as himself, but after turning them into the right position for\r\ngetting a good hold with his long sickle-teeth he managed to drag them\r\nup to the foot of the tree from which he had cut them, moving backward.\r\nThen seating himself comfortably, he held them on end, bottom up, and\r\ndemolished them at his ease. A good deal of nibbling had to be done\r\nbefore he got anything to eat, because the lower scales are barren, but\r\nwhen he had patiently worked his way up to the fertile ones he found\r\ntwo sweet nuts at the base of each, shaped like trimmed hams, and\r\nspotted purple like birds\xe2\x80\x99 eggs. And notwithstanding these cones were\r\ndripping with soft balsam, and covered with prickles, and so strongly\r\nput together that a boy would be puzzled to cut them open with a\r\njack-knife, he accomplished his meal with easy dignity and cleanliness,\r\nmaking less effort apparently than a man would in eating soft cookery\r\nfrom a plate.\r\n\r\nBreakfast done, I whistled a tune for him before he went to work,\r\ncurious to see how he would be affected by it. He had not seen me all\r\nthis while; but the instant I began to whistle he darted up the tree\r\nnearest to him, and came out on a small dead limb opposite me, and\r\ncomposed himself to listen. I sang and whistled more than a dozen airs,\r\nand as the music changed his eyes sparkled, and he turned his head\r\nquickly from side to side, but made no other response. Other squirrels,\r\nhearing the strange sounds, came around on all sides, also chipmunks\r\nand birds. One of the birds, a handsome, speckle-breasted thrush,\r\nseemed even more interested than the squirrels. After listening for\r\nawhile on one of the lower dead sprays of a pine, he came swooping\r\nforward within a few feet of my face, and remained fluttering in the\r\nair for half a minute or so, sustaining himself with whirring\r\nwing-beats, like a humming-bird in front of a flower, while I could\r\nlook into his eyes and see his innocent wonder.\r\n\r\nBy this time my performance must have lasted nearly half an hour. I\r\nsang or whistled \xe2\x80\x9cBonnie Boon,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLass o\xe2\x80\x99 Gowrie,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cO\xe2\x80\x99er the Water to\r\nCharlie,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBonnie Woods o\xe2\x80\x99 Cragie Lee,\xe2\x80\x9d etc., all of which seemed to be\r\nlistened to with bright interest, my first Douglas sitting patiently\r\nthrough it all, with his telling eyes fixed upon me until I ventured to\r\ngive the \xe2\x80\x9cOld Hundredth,\xe2\x80\x9d when he screamed his Indian name,\r\nPillillooeet, turned tail, and darted with ludicrous haste up the tree\r\nout of sight, his voice and actions in the case leaving a somewhat\r\nprofane impression, as if he had said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be hanged if you get me to\r\nhear anything so solemn and unpiny.\xe2\x80\x9d This acted as a signal for the\r\ngeneral dispersal of the whole hairy tribe, though the birds seemed\r\nwilling to wait further developments, music being naturally more in\r\ntheir line.\r\n\r\nWhat there can be in that grand old church-tune that is so offensive to\r\nbirds and squirrels I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine. A year or two after this High\r\nSierra concert, I was sitting one fine day on a hill in the Coast Range\r\nwhere the common Ground Squirrels were abundant. They were very shy on\r\naccount of being hunted so much; but after I had been silent and\r\nmotionless for half an hour or so they began to venture out of their\r\nholes and to feed on the seeds of the grasses and thistles around me as\r\nif I were no more to be feared than a tree-stump. Then it occurred to\r\nme that this was a good opportunity to find out whether they also\r\ndisliked \xe2\x80\x9cOld Hundredth.\xe2\x80\x9d Therefore I began to whistle as nearly as I\r\ncould remember the same familiar airs that had pleased the mountaineers\r\nof the Sierra. They at once stopped eating, stood erect, and listened\r\npatiently until I came to \xe2\x80\x9cOld Hundredth,\xe2\x80\x9d when with ludicrous haste\r\nevery one of them rushed to their holes and bolted in, their feet\r\ntwinkling in the air for a moment as they vanished.\r\n\r\nNo one who makes the acquaintance of our forester will fail to admire\r\nhim; but he is far too self-reliant and warlike ever to be taken for a\r\ndarling.\r\n\r\nHow long the life of a Douglas Squirrel may be, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. The young\r\nseem to sprout from knot-holes, perfect from the first, and as enduring\r\nas their own trees. It is difficult, indeed, to realize that so\r\ncondensed a piece of sun-fire should ever become dim or die at all. He\r\nis seldom killed by hunters, for he is too small to encourage much of\r\ntheir attention, and when pursued in settled regions becomes\r\nexcessively shy, and keeps close in the furrows of the highest trunks,\r\nmany of which are of the same color as himself. Indian boys, however,\r\nlie in wait with unbounded patience to shoot them with arrows. In the\r\nlower and middle zones a few fall a prey to rattlesnakes. Occasionally\r\nhe is pursued by hawks and wildcats, etc. But, upon the whole, he\r\ndwells safely in the deep bosom of the woods, the most highly favored\r\nof all his happy tribe. May his tribe increase!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRYING THE BOW.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\nA WIND-STORM IN THE FORESTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mountain winds, like the dew and rain, sunshine and snow, are\r\nmeasured and bestowed with love on the forests to develop their\r\nstrength and beauty. However restricted the scope of other forest\r\ninfluences, that of the winds is universal. The snow bends and trims\r\nthe upper forests every winter, the lightning strikes a single tree\r\nhere and there, while avalanches mow down thousands at a swoop as a\r\ngardener trims out a bed of flowers. But the winds go to every tree,\r\nfingering every leaf and branch and furrowed bole; not one is\r\nforgotten; the Mountain Pine towering with outstretched arms on the\r\nrugged buttresses of the icy peaks, the lowliest and most retiring\r\ntenant of the dells; they seek and find them all, caressing them\r\ntenderly, bending them in lusty exercise, stimulating their growth,\r\nplucking off a leaf or limb as required, or removing an entire tree or\r\ngrove, now whispering and cooing through the branches like a sleepy\r\nchild, now roaring like the ocean; the winds blessing the forests, the\r\nforests the winds, with ineffable beauty and harmony as the sure\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WIND-STORM IN THE CALIFORNIA FORESTS. (AFTER A\r\nSKETCH BY THE AUTHOR.)]\r\n\r\nAfter one has seen pines six feet in diameter bending like grasses\r\nbefore a mountain gale, and ever and anon some giant falling with a\r\ncrash that shakes the hills, it seems astonishing that any, save the\r\nlowest thickset trees, could ever have found a period sufficiently\r\nstormless to establish themselves; or, once established, that they\r\nshould not, sooner or later, have been blown down. But when the storm\r\nis over, and we behold the same forests tranquil again, towering fresh\r\nand unscathed in erect majesty, and consider what centuries of storms\r\nhave fallen upon them since they were first planted,\xe2\x80\x94hail, to break the\r\ntender seedlings; lightning, to scorch and shatter; snow, winds, and\r\navalanches, to crush and overwhelm,\xe2\x80\x94while the manifest result of all\r\nthis wild storm-culture is the glorious perfection we behold; then\r\nfaith in Nature\xe2\x80\x99s forestry is established, and we cease to deplore the\r\nviolence of her most destructive gales, or of any other storm-implement\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\nThere are two trees in the Sierra forests that are never blown down, so\r\nlong as they continue in sound health. These are the Juniper and the\r\nDwarf Pine of the summit peaks. Their stiff, crooked roots grip the\r\nstorm-beaten ledges like eagles\xe2\x80\x99 claws, while their lithe, cord-like\r\nbranches bend round compliantly, offering but slight holds for winds,\r\nhowever violent. The other alpine conifers\xe2\x80\x94the Needle Pine, Mountain\r\nPine, Two-leaved Pine, and Hemlock Spruce\xe2\x80\x94are never thinned out by this\r\nagent to any destructive extent, on account of their admirable\r\ntoughness and the closeness of their growth. In general the same is\r\ntrue of the giants of the lower zones. The kingly Sugar Pine, towering\r\naloft to a height of more than 200 feet, offers a fine mark to\r\nstorm-winds; but it is not densely foliaged, and its long, horizontal\r\narms swing round compliantly in the blast, like tresses of green,\r\nfluent algae in a brook; while the Silver Firs in most places keep\r\ntheir ranks well together in united strength. The Yellow or Silver Pine\r\nis more frequently overturned than any other tree on the Sierra,\r\nbecause its leaves and branches form a larger mass in proportion to its\r\nheight, while in many places it is planted sparsely, leaving open lanes\r\nthrough which storms may enter with full force. Furthermore, because it\r\nis distributed along the lower portion of the range, which was the\r\nfirst to be left bare on the breaking up of the ice-sheet at the close\r\nof the glacial winter, the soil it is growing upon has been longer\r\nexposed to post-glacial weathering, and consequently is in a more\r\ncrumbling, decayed condition than the fresher soils farther up the\r\nrange, and therefore offers a less secure anchorage for the roots.\r\n\r\nWhile exploring the forest zones of Mount Shasta, I discovered the path\r\nof a hurricane strewn with thousands of pines of this species. Great\r\nand small had been uprooted or wrenched off by sheer force, making a\r\nclean gap, like that made by a snow avalanche. But hurricanes capable\r\nof doing this class of work are rare in the Sierra, and when we have\r\nexplored the forests from one extremity of the range to the other, we\r\nare compelled to believe that they are the most beautiful on the face\r\nof the earth, however we may regard the agents that have made them so.\r\n\r\nThere is always something deeply exciting, not only in the sounds of\r\nwinds in the woods, which exert more or less influence over every mind,\r\nbut in their varied waterlike flow as manifested by the movements of\r\nthe trees, especially those of the conifers. By no other trees are they\r\nrendered so extensively and impressively visible, not even by the\r\nlordly tropic palms or tree-ferns responsive to the gentlest breeze.\r\nThe waving of a forest of the giant Sequoias is indescribably\r\nimpressive and sublime, but the pines seem to me the best interpreters\r\nof winds. They are mighty waving goldenrods, ever in tune, singing and\r\nwriting wind-music all their long century lives. Little, however, of\r\nthis noble tree-waving and tree-music will you see or hear in the\r\nstrictly alpine portion of the forests. The burly Juniper, whose girth\r\nsometimes more than equals its height, is about as rigid as the rocks\r\non which it grows. The slender lash-like sprays of the Dwarf Pine\r\nstream out in wavering ripples, but the tallest and slenderest are far\r\ntoo unyielding to wave even in the heaviest gales. They only shake in\r\nquick, short vibrations. The Hemlock Spruce, however, and the Mountain\r\nPine, and some of the tallest thickets of the Two-leaved species bow in\r\nstorms with considerable scope and gracefulness. But it is only in the\r\nlower and middle zones that the meeting of winds and woods is to be\r\nseen in all its grandeur.\r\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful and exhilarating storms I ever enjoyed in the\r\nSierra occurred in December, 1874, when I happened to be exploring one\r\nof the tributary valleys of the Yuba River. The sky and the ground and\r\nthe trees had been thoroughly rain-washed and were dry again. The day\r\nwas intensely pure, one of those incomparable bits of California\r\nwinter, warm and balmy and full of white sparkling sunshine, redolent\r\nof all the purest influences of the spring, and at the same time\r\nenlivened with one of the most bracing wind-storms conceivable. Instead\r\nof camping out, as I usually do, I then chanced to be stopping at the\r\nhouse of a friend. But when the storm began to sound, I lost no time in\r\npushing out into the woods to enjoy it. For on such occasions Nature\r\nhas always something rare to show us, and the danger to life and limb\r\nis hardly greater than one would experience crouching deprecatingly\r\nbeneath a roof.\r\n\r\nIt was still early morning when I found myself fairly adrift. Delicious\r\nsunshine came pouring over the hills, lighting the tops of the pines,\r\nand setting free a steam of summery fragrance that contrasted strangely\r\nwith the wild tones of the storm. The air was mottled with pine-tassels\r\nand bright green plumes, that went flashing past in the sunlight like\r\nbirds pursued. But there was not the slightest dustiness, nothing less\r\npure than leaves, and ripe pollen, and flecks of withered bracken and\r\nmoss. I heard trees falling for hours at the rate of one every two or\r\nthree minutes; some uprooted, partly on account of the loose,\r\nwater-soaked condition of the ground; others broken straight across,\r\nwhere some weakness caused by fire had determined the spot. The\r\ngestures of the various trees made a delightful study. Young Sugar\r\nPines, light and feathery as squirrel-tails, were bowing almost to the\r\nground; while the grand old patriarchs, whose massive boles had been\r\ntried in a hundred storms, waved solemnly above them, their long,\r\narching branches streaming fluently on the gale, and every needle\r\nthrilling and ringing and shedding off keen lances of light like a\r\ndiamond. The Douglas Spruces, with long sprays drawn out in level\r\ntresses, and needles massed in a gray, shimmering glow, presented a\r\nmost striking appearance as they stood in bold relief along the\r\nhilltops. The madro\xc3\xb1os in the dells, with their red bark and large\r\nglossy leaves tilted every way, reflected the sunshine in throbbing\r\nspangles like those one so often sees on the rippled surface of a\r\nglacier lake. But the Silver Pines were now the most impressively\r\nbeautiful of all. Colossal spires 200 feet in height waved like supple\r\ngolden-rods chanting and bowing low as if in worship, while the whole\r\nmass of their long, tremulous foliage was kindled into one continuous\r\nblaze of white sun-fire. The force of the gale was such that the most\r\nsteadfast monarch of them all rocked down to its roots with a motion\r\nplainly perceptible when one leaned against it. Nature was holding high\r\nfestival, and every fiber of the most rigid giants thrilled with glad\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nI drifted on through the midst of this passionate music and motion,\r\nacross many a glen, from ridge to ridge; often halting in the lee of a\r\nrock for shelter, or to gaze and listen. Even when the grand anthem had\r\nswelled to its highest pitch, I could distinctly hear the varying tones\r\nof individual trees,\xe2\x80\x94Spruce, and Fir, and Pine, and leafless Oak,\xe2\x80\x94and\r\neven the infinitely gentle rustle of the withered grasses at my feet.\r\nEach was expressing itself in its own way,\xe2\x80\x94singing its own song, and\r\nmaking its own peculiar gestures,\xe2\x80\x94manifesting a richness of variety to\r\nbe found in no other forest I have yet seen. The coniferous woods of\r\nCanada, and the Carolinas, and Florida, are made up of trees that\r\nresemble one another about as nearly as blades of grass, and grow close\r\ntogether in much the same way. Coniferous trees, in general, seldom\r\npossess individual character, such as is manifest among Oaks and Elms.\r\nBut the California forests are made up of a greater number of distinct\r\nspecies than any other in the world. And in them we find, not only a\r\nmarked differentiation into special groups, but also a marked\r\nindividuality in almost every tree, giving rise to storm effects\r\nindescribably glorious.\r\n\r\nToward midday, after a long, tingling scramble through copses of hazel\r\nand ceanothus, I gained the summit of the highest ridge in the\r\nneighborhood; and then it occurred to me that it would be a fine thing\r\nto climb one of the trees to obtain a wider outlook and get my ear\r\nclose to the Aeolian music of its topmost needles. But under the\r\ncircumstances the choice of a tree was a serious matter. One whose\r\ninstep was not very strong seemed in danger of being blown down, or of\r\nbeing struck by others in case they should fall; another was branchless\r\nto a considerable height above the ground, and at the same time too\r\nlarge to be grasped with arms and legs in climbing; while others were\r\nnot favorably situated for clear views. After cautiously casting about,\r\nI made choice of the tallest of a group of Douglas Spruces that were\r\ngrowing close together like a tuft of grass, no one of which seemed\r\nlikely to fall unless all the rest fell with it. Though comparatively\r\nyoung, they were about 100 feet high, and their lithe, brushy tops were\r\nrocking and swirling in wild ecstasy. Being accustomed to climb trees\r\nin making botanical studies, I experienced no difficulty in reaching\r\nthe top of this one, and never before did I enjoy so noble an\r\nexhilaration of motion. The slender tops fairly flapped and swished in\r\nthe passionate torrent, bending and swirling backward and forward,\r\nround and round, tracing indescribable combinations of vertical and\r\nhorizontal curves, while I clung with muscles firm braced, like a\r\nbobolink on a reed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YELLOW PINE AND LIBOCEDRUS\r\nThe two inside trees are Libocedrus, the two outside trees, Yellow\r\nPine.]\r\n\r\nIn its widest sweeps my tree-top described an arc of from twenty to\r\nthirty degrees, but I felt sure of its elastic temper, having seen\r\nothers of the same species still more severely tried\xe2\x80\x94bent almost to the\r\nground indeed, in heavy snows\xe2\x80\x94without breaking a fiber. I was therefore\r\nsafe, and free to take the wind into my pulses and enjoy the excited\r\nforest from my superb outlook. The view from here must be extremely\r\nbeautiful in any weather. Now my eye roved over the piny hills and\r\ndales as over fields of waving grain, and felt the light running in\r\nripples and broad swelling undulations across the valleys from ridge to\r\nridge, as the shining foliage was stirred by corresponding waves of\r\nair. Oftentimes these waves of reflected light would break up suddenly\r\ninto a kind of beaten foam, and again, after chasing one another in\r\nregular order, they would seem to bend forward in concentric curves,\r\nand disappear on some hillside, like sea-waves on a shelving shore. The\r\nquantity of light reflected from the bent needles was so great as to\r\nmake whole groves appear as if covered with snow, while the black\r\nshadows beneath the trees greatly enhanced the effect of the silvery\r\nsplendor.\r\n\r\nExcepting only the shadows there was nothing somber in all this wild\r\nsea of pines. On the contrary, notwithstanding this was the winter\r\nseason, the colors were remarkably beautiful. The shafts of the pine\r\nand libocedrus were brown and purple, and most of the foliage was well\r\ntinged with yellow; the laurel groves, with the pale undersides of\r\ntheir leaves turned upward, made masses of gray; and then there was\r\nmany a dash of chocolate color from clumps of manzanita, and jet of\r\nvivid crimson from the bark of the madro\xc3\xb1os, while the ground on the\r\nhillsides, appearing here and there through openings between the\r\ngroves, displayed masses of pale purple and brown.\r\n\r\nThe sounds of the storm corresponded gloriously with this wild\r\nexuberance of light and motion. The profound bass of the naked branches\r\nand boles booming like waterfalls; the quick, tense vibrations of the\r\npine-needles, now rising to a shrill, whistling hiss, now falling to a\r\nsilky murmur; the rustling of laurel groves in the dells, and the keen\r\nmetallic click of leaf on leaf\xe2\x80\x94all this was heard in easy analysis when\r\nthe attention was calmly bent.\r\n\r\nThe varied gestures of the multitude were seen to fine advantage, so\r\nthat one could recognize the different species at a distance of several\r\nmiles by this means alone, as well as by their forms and colors, and\r\nthe way they reflected the light. All seemed strong and comfortable, as\r\nif really enjoying the storm, while responding to its most enthusiastic\r\ngreetings. We hear much nowadays concerning the universal struggle for\r\nexistence, but no struggle in the common meaning of the word was\r\nmanifest here; no recognition of danger by any tree; no deprecation;\r\nbut rather an invincible gladness as remote from exultation as from\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nI kept my lofty perch for hours, frequently closing my eyes to enjoy\r\nthe music by itself, or to feast quietly on the delicious fragrance\r\nthat was streaming past. The fragrance of the woods was less marked\r\nthan that produced during warm rain, when so many balsamic buds and\r\nleaves are steeped like tea; but, from the chafing of resiny branches\r\nagainst each other, and the incessant attrition of myriads of needles,\r\nthe gale was spiced to a very tonic degree. And besides the fragrance\r\nfrom these local sources there were traces of scents brought from afar.\r\nFor this wind came first from the sea, rubbing against its fresh, briny\r\nwaves, then distilled through the redwoods, threading rich ferny\r\ngulches, and spreading itself in broad undulating currents over many a\r\nflower-enameled ridge of the coast mountains, then across the golden\r\nplains, up the purple foot-hills, and into these piny woods with the\r\nvaried incense gathered by the way.\r\n\r\nWinds are advertisements of all they touch, however much or little we\r\nmay be able to read them; telling their wanderings even by their scents\r\nalone. Mariners detect the flowery perfume of land-winds far at sea,\r\nand sea-winds carry the fragrance of dulse and tangle far inland, where\r\nit is quickly recognized, though mingled with the scents of a thousand\r\nland-flowers. As an illustration of this, I may tell here that I\r\nbreathed sea-air on the Firth of Forth, in Scotland, while a boy; then\r\nwas taken to Wisconsin, where I remained nineteen years; then, without\r\nin all this time having breathed one breath of the sea, I walked\r\nquietly, alone, from the middle of the Mississippi Valley to the Gulf\r\nof Mexico, on a botanical excursion, and while in Florida, far from the\r\ncoast, my attention wholly bent on the splendid tropical vegetation\r\nabout me, I suddenly recognized a sea-breeze, as it came sifting\r\nthrough the palmettos and blooming vine-tangles, which at once awakened\r\nand set free a thousand dormant associations, and made me a boy again\r\nin Scotland, as if all the intervening years had been annihilated.\r\n\r\nMost people like to look at mountain rivers, and bear them in mind; but\r\nfew care to look at the winds, though far more beautiful and sublime,\r\nand though they become at times about as visible as flowing water. When\r\nthe north winds in winter are making upward sweeps over the curving\r\nsummits of the High Sierra, the fact is sometimes published with flying\r\nsnow-banners a mile long. Those portions of the winds thus embodied can\r\nscarce be wholly invisible, even to the darkest imagination. And when\r\nwe look around over an agitated forest, we may see something of the\r\nwind that stirs it, by its effects upon the trees. Yonder it descends\r\nin a rush of water-like ripples, and sweeps over the bending pines from\r\nhill to hill. Nearer, we see detached plumes and leaves, now speeding\r\nby on level currents, now whirling in eddies, or, escaping over the\r\nedges of the whirls, soaring aloft on grand, upswelling domes of air,\r\nor tossing on flame-like crests. Smooth, deep currents, cascades,\r\nfalls, and swirling eddies, sing around every tree and leaf, and over\r\nall the varied topography of the region with telling changes of form,\r\nlike mountain rivers conforming to the features of their channels.\r\n\r\nAfter tracing the Sierra streams from their fountains to the plains,\r\nmarking where they bloom white in falls, glide in crystal plumes, surge\r\ngray and foam-filled in boulder-choked gorges, and slip through the\r\nwoods in long, tranquil reaches\xe2\x80\x94after thus learning their language and\r\nforms in detail, we may at length hear them chanting all together in\r\none grand anthem, and comprehend them all in clear inner vision,\r\ncovering the range like lace. But even this spectacle is far less\r\nsublime and not a whit more substantial than what we may behold of\r\nthese storm-streams of air in the mountain woods.\r\n\r\nWe all travel the milky way together, trees and men; but it never\r\noccurred to me until this storm-day, while swinging in the wind, that\r\ntrees are travelers, in the ordinary sense. They make many journeys,\r\nnot extensive ones, it is true; but our own little journeys, away and\r\nback again, are only little more than tree-wavings\xe2\x80\x94many of them not so\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nWhen the storm began to abate, I dismounted and sauntered down through\r\nthe calming woods. The storm-tones died away, and, turning toward the\r\neast, I beheld the countless hosts of the forests hushed and tranquil,\r\ntowering above one another on the slopes of the hills like a devout\r\naudience. The setting sun filled them with amber light, and seemed to\r\nsay, while they listened, \xe2\x80\x9cMy peace I give unto you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I gazed on the impressive scene, all the so-called ruin of the storm\r\nwas forgotten, and never before did these noble woods appear so fresh,\r\nso joyous, so immortal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\nTHE RIVER FLOODS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sierra rivers are flooded every spring by the melting of the snow\r\nas regularly as the famous old Nile. They begin to rise in May, and in\r\nJune high-water mark is reached. But because the melting does not go on\r\nrapidly over all the fountains, high and low, simultaneously, and the\r\nmelted snow is not reinforced at this time of year by rain, the spring\r\nfloods are seldom very violent or destructive. The thousand falls,\r\nhowever, and the cascades in the ca\xc3\xb1ons are then in full bloom, and\r\nsing songs from one end of the range to the other. Of course the snow\r\non the lower tributaries of the rivers is first melted, then that on\r\nthe higher fountains most exposed to sunshine, and about a month later\r\nthe cooler, shadowy fountains send down their treasures, thus allowing\r\nthe main trunk streams nearly six weeks to get their waters hurried\r\nthrough the foot-hills and across the lowlands to the sea. Therefore\r\nvery violent spring floods are avoided, and will be as long as the\r\nshading, restraining forests last. The rivers of the north half of the\r\nrange are still less subject to sudden floods, because their upper\r\nfountains in great part lie protected from the changes of the weather\r\nbeneath thick folds of lava, just as many of the rivers of Alaska lie\r\nbeneath folds of ice, coming to the light farther down the range in\r\nlarge springs, while those of the high Sierra lie on the surface of\r\nsolid granite, exposed to every change of temperature. More than ninety\r\nper cent. of the water derived from the snow and ice of Mount Shasta is\r\nat once absorbed and drained away beneath the porous lava folds of the\r\nmountain, where mumbling and groping in the dark they at length find\r\nlarger fissures and tunnel-like caves from which they emerge, filtered\r\nand cool, in the form of large springs, some of them so large they give\r\nbirth to rivers that set out on their journeys beneath the sun without\r\nany visible intermediate period of childhood. Thus the Shasta River\r\nissues from a large lake-like spring in Shasta Valley, and about two\r\nthirds of the volume of the McCloud River gushes forth suddenly from\r\nthe face of a lava bluff in a roaring spring seventy-five yards wide.\r\n\r\nThese spring rivers of the north are of course shorter than those of\r\nthe south whose tributaries extend up to the tops of the mountains.\r\nFall River, an important tributary of the Pitt or Upper Sacramento, is\r\nonly about ten miles long, and is all falls, cascades, and springs from\r\nits head to its confluence with the Pitt. Bountiful springs, charmingly\r\nembowered, issue from the rocks at one end of it, a snowy fall a\r\nhundred and eighty feet high thunders at the other, and a rush of\r\ncrystal rapids sing and dance between. Of course such streams are but\r\nlittle affected by the weather. Sheltered from evaporation their flow\r\nis nearly as full in the autumn as in the time of general spring\r\nfloods. While those of the high Sierra diminish to less than the\r\nhundredth part of their springtime prime, shallowing in autumn to a\r\nseries of silent pools among the rocks and hollows of their channels,\r\nconnected by feeble, creeping threads of water, like the sluggish\r\nsentences of a tired writer, connected by a drizzle of \xe2\x80\x9cands\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbuts.\xe2\x80\x9d Strange to say, the greatest floods occur in winter, when one\r\nwould suppose all the wild waters would be muffled and chained in frost\r\nand snow. The same long, all-day storms of the so-called Rainy Season\r\nin California, that give rain to the lowlands, give dry frosty snow to\r\nthe mountains. But at rare intervals warm rains and warm winds invade\r\nthe mountains and push back the snow line from 2000 feet to 8000, or\r\neven higher, and then come the big floods.\r\n\r\nI was usually driven down out of the High Sierra about the end of\r\nNovember, but the winter of 1874 and 1875 was so warm and calm that I\r\nwas tempted to seek general views of the geology and topography of the\r\nbasin of Feather River in January. And I had just completed a hasty\r\nsurvey of the region, and made my way down to winter quarters, when one\r\nof the grandest flood-storms that I ever saw broke on the mountains. I\r\nwas then in the edge of the main forest belt at a small foot-hill town\r\ncalled Knoxville, on the divide between the waters of the Feather and\r\nYuba rivers. The cause of this notable flood was simply a sudden and\r\ncopious fall of warm wind and rain on the basins of these rivers at a\r\ntime when they contained a considerable quantity of snow. The rain was\r\nso heavy and long-sustained that it was, of itself, sufficient to make\r\na good wild flood, while the snow which the warm wind and rain melted\r\non the upper and middle regions of the basins was sufficient to make\r\nanother flood equal to that of the rain. Now these two distinct\r\nharvests of flood waters were gathered simultaneously and poured out on\r\nthe plain in one magnificent avalanche. The basins of the Yuba and\r\nFeather, like many others of the Sierra, are admirably adapted to the\r\ngrowth of floods of this kind. Their many tributaries radiate far and\r\nwide, comprehending extensive areas, and the tributaries are steeply\r\ninclined, while the trunks are comparatively level. While the\r\nflood-storm was in progress the thermometer at Knoxville ranged between\r\n44\xc2\xb0 and 50\xc2\xb0; and when warm wind and warm rain fall simultaneously on\r\nsnow contained in basins like these, both the rain and that portion of\r\nthe snow which the rain and wind melt are at first sponged up and held\r\nback until the combined mass becomes sludge, which at length, suddenly\r\ndissolving, slips and descends all together to the trunk channel; and\r\nsince the deeper the stream the faster it flows, the flooded portion of\r\nthe current above overtakes the slower foot-hill portion below it, and\r\nall sweeping forward together with a high, overcurling front, debouches\r\non the open plain with a violence and suddenness that at first seem\r\nwholly unaccountable. The destructiveness of the lower portion of this\r\nparticular flood was somewhat augmented by mining gravel in the river\r\nchannels, and by levees which gave way after having at first restrained\r\nand held back the accumulating waters. These exaggerating conditions\r\ndid not, however, greatly influence the general result, the main effect\r\nhaving been caused by the rare combination of flood factors indicated\r\nabove. It is a pity that but few people meet and enjoy storms so noble\r\nas this in their homes in the mountains, for, spending themselves in\r\nthe open levels of the plains, they are likely to be remembered more by\r\nthe bridges and houses they carry away than by their beauty or the\r\nthousand blessings they bring to the fields and gardens of Nature.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the flood, January 19th, all the Feather and Yuba\r\nlandscapes were covered with running water, muddy torrents filled every\r\ngulch and ravine, and the sky was thick with rain. The pines had long\r\nbeen sleeping in sunshine; they were now awake, roaring and waving with\r\nthe beating storm, and the winds sweeping along the curves of hill and\r\ndale, streaming through the woods, surging and gurgling on the tops of\r\nrocky ridges, made the wildest of wild storm melody.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to see that only a small part of the rain reached the\r\nground in the form of drops. Most of it was thrashed into dusty spray\r\nlike that into which small waterfalls are divided when they dash on\r\nshelving rocks. Never have I seen water coming from the sky in denser\r\nor more passionate streams. The wind chased the spray forward in\r\nchoking drifts, and compelled me again and again to seek shelter in the\r\ndell copses and back of large trees to rest and catch my breath.\r\nWherever I went, on ridges or in hollows, enthusiastic water still\r\nflashed and gurgled about my ankles, recalling a wild winter flood in\r\nYosemite when a hundred waterfalls came booming and chanting together\r\nand filled the grand valley with a sea-like roar.\r\n\r\nAfter drifting an hour or two in the lower woods, I set out for the\r\nsummit of a hill 900 feet high, with a view to getting as near the\r\nheart of the storm as possible. In order to reach it I had to cross Dry\r\nCreek, a tributary of the Yuba that goes crawling along the base of the\r\nhill on the northwest. It was now a booming river as large as the\r\nTuolumne at ordinary stages, its current brown with mining-mud washed\r\ndown from many a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim,\xe2\x80\x9d and mottled with sluice-boxes, fence-rails,\r\nand logs that had long lain above its reach. A slim foot-bridge\r\nstretched across it, now scarcely above the swollen current. Here I was\r\nglad to linger, gazing and listening, while the storm was in its\r\nrichest mood\xe2\x80\x94the gray rain-flood above, the brown river-flood beneath.\r\nThe language of the river was scarcely less enchanting than that of the\r\nwind and rain; the sublime overboom of the main bouncing, exulting\r\ncurrent, the swash and gurgle of the eddies, the keen dash and clash of\r\nheavy waves breaking against rocks, and the smooth, downy hush of\r\nshallow currents feeling their way through the willow thickets of the\r\nmargin. And amid all this varied throng of sounds I heard the smothered\r\nbumping and rumbling of boulders on the bottom as they were shoving and\r\nrolling forward against one another in a wild rush, after having lain\r\nstill for probably 100 years or more.\r\n\r\nThe glad creek rose high above its banks and wandered from its channel\r\nout over many a briery sand-flat and meadow. Alders and willows\r\nwaist-deep were bearing up against the current with nervous trembling\r\ngestures, as if afraid of being carried away, while supple branches\r\nbending confidingly, dipped lightly and rose again, as if stroking the\r\nwild waters in play. Leaving the bridge and passing on through the\r\nstorm-thrashed woods, all the ground seemed to be moving. Pine-tassels,\r\nflakes of bark, soil, leaves, and broken branches were being swept\r\nforward, and many a rock-fragment, weathered from exposed ledges, was\r\nnow receiving its first rounding and polishing in the wild streams of\r\nthe storm. On they rushed through every gulch and hollow, leaping,\r\ngliding, working with a will, and rejoicing like living creatures.\r\n\r\nNor was the flood confined to the ground. Every tree had a water system\r\nof its own spreading far and wide like miniature Amazons and\r\nMississippis.\r\n\r\nToward midday, cloud, wind, and rain reached their highest development.\r\nThe storm was in full bloom, and formed, from my commanding outlook on\r\nthe hilltop, one of the most glorious views I ever beheld. As far as\r\nthe eye could reach, above, beneath, around, wind-driven rain filled\r\nthe air like one vast waterfall. Detached clouds swept imposingly up\r\nthe valley, as if they were endowed with independent motion and had\r\nspecial work to do in replenishing the mountain wells, now rising above\r\nthe pine-tops, now descending into their midst, fondling their arrowy\r\nspires and soothing every branch and leaf with gentleness in the midst\r\nof all the savage sound and motion. Others keeping near the ground\r\nglided behind separate groves, and brought them forward into relief\r\nwith admirable distinctness; or, passing in front, eclipsed whole\r\ngroves in succession, pine after pine melting in their gray fringes and\r\nbursting forth again seemingly clearer than before.\r\n\r\nThe forms of storms are in great part measured, and controlled by the\r\ntopography of the regions where they rise and over which they pass.\r\nWhen, therefore, we attempt to study them from the valleys, or from\r\ngaps and openings of the forest, we are confounded by a multitude of\r\nseparate and apparently antagonistic impressions. The bottom of the\r\nstorm is broken up into innumerable waves and currents that surge\r\nagainst the hillsides like sea-waves against a shore, and these,\r\nreacting on the nether surface of the storm, erode immense cavernous\r\nhollows and ca\xc3\xb1ons, and sweep forward the resulting detritus in long\r\ntrains, like the moraines of glaciers. But, as we ascend, these\r\npartial, confusing effects disappear and the phenomena are beheld\r\nunited and harmonious.\r\n\r\nThe longer I gazed into the storm, the more plainly visible it became.\r\nThe drifting cloud detritus gave it a kind of visible body, which\r\nexplained many perplexing phenomena, and published its movements in\r\nplain terms, while the texture of the falling mass of rain rounded it\r\nout and rendered it more complete. Because raindrops differ in size\r\nthey fall at different velocities and overtake and clash against one\r\nanother, producing mist and spray. They also, of course, yield unequal\r\ncompliance to the force of the wind, which gives rise to a still\r\ngreater degree of interference, and passionate gusts sweep off clouds\r\nof spray from the groves like that torn from wave-tops in a gale. All\r\nthese factors of irregularity in density, color, and texture of the\r\ngeneral rain mass tend to make it the more appreciable and telling. It\r\nis then seen as one grand flood rushing over bank and brae, bending the\r\npines like weeds, curving this way and that, whirling in huge eddies in\r\nhollows and dells, while the main current pours grandly over all, like\r\nocean currents over the landscapes that lie hidden at the bottom of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nI watched the gestures of the pines while the storm was at its height,\r\nand it was easy to see that they were not distressed. Several large\r\nSugar Pines stood near the thicket in which I was sheltered, bowing\r\nsolemnly and tossing their long arms as if interpreting the very words\r\nof the storm while accepting its wildest onsets with passionate\r\nexhilaration. The lions were feeding. Those who have observed\r\nsunflowers feasting on sunshine during the golden days of Indian summer\r\nknow that none of their gestures express thankfulness. Their celestial\r\nfood is too heartily given, too heartily taken to leave room for\r\nthanks. The pines were evidently accepting the benefactions of the\r\nstorm in the same whole-souled manner; and when I looked down among the\r\nbudding hazels, and still lower to the young violets and fern-tufts on\r\nthe rocks, I noticed the same divine methods of giving and taking, and\r\nthe same exquisite adaptations of what seems an outbreak of violent and\r\nuncontrollable force to the purposes of beautiful and delicate life.\r\nCalms like sleep come upon landscapes, just as they do on people and\r\ntrees, and storms awaken them in the same way. In the dry midsummer of\r\nthe lower portion of the range the withered hills and valleys seem to\r\nlie as empty and expressionless as dead shells on a shore. Even the\r\nhighest mountains may be found occasionally dull and uncommunicative as\r\nif in some way they had lost countenance and shrunk to less than half\r\ntheir real stature. But when the lightnings crash and echo in the\r\nca\xc3\xb1ons, and the clouds come down wreathing and crowning their bald\r\nsnowy heads, every feature beams with expression and they rise again in\r\nall their imposing majesty.\r\n\r\nStorms are fine speakers, and tell all they know, but their voices of\r\nlightning, torrent, and rushing wind are much less numerous than the\r\nnameless still, small voices too low for human ears; and because we are\r\npoor listeners we fail to catch much that is fairly within reach. Our\r\nbest rains are heard mostly on roofs, and winds in chimneys; and when\r\nby choice or compulsion we are pushed into the heart of a storm, the\r\nconfusion made by cumbersome equipments and nervous haste and mean\r\nfear, prevent our hearing any other than the loudest expressions. Yet\r\nwe may draw enjoyment from storm sounds that are beyond hearing, and\r\nstorm movements we cannot see. The sublime whirl of planets around\r\ntheir suns is as silent as raindrops oozing in the dark among the roots\r\nof plants. In this great storm, as in every other, there were tones and\r\ngestures inexpressibly gentle manifested in the midst of what is called\r\nviolence and fury, but easily recognized by all who look and listen for\r\nthem. The rain brought out the colors of the woods with delightful\r\nfreshness, the rich brown of the bark of the trees and the fallen burs\r\nand leaves and dead ferns; the grays of rocks and lichens; the light\r\npurple of swelling buds, and the warm yellow greens of the libocedrus\r\nand mosses. The air was steaming with delightful fragrance, not rising\r\nand wafting past in separate masses, but diffused through all the\r\natmosphere. Pine woods are always fragrant, but most so in spring when\r\nthe young tassels are opening and in warm weather when the various gums\r\nand balsams are softened by the sun. The wind was now chafing their\r\ninnumerable needles and the warm rain was steeping them. Monardella\r\ngrows here in large beds in the openings, and there is plenty of laurel\r\nin dells and manzanita on the hillsides, and the rosy, fragrant\r\nchamoebatia carpets the ground almost everywhere. These, with the gums\r\nand balsams of the woods, form the main local fragrance-fountains of\r\nthe storm. The ascending clouds of aroma wind-rolled and rain-washed\r\nbecame pure like light and traveled with the wind as part of it. Toward\r\nthe middle of the afternoon the main flood cloud lifted along its\r\nwestern border revealing a beautiful section of the Sacramento Valley\r\nsome twenty or thirty miles away, brilliantly sun-lighted and\r\nglistering with rain-sheets as if paved with silver. Soon afterward a\r\njagged bluff-like cloud with a sheer face appeared over the valley of\r\nthe Yuba, dark-colored and roughened with numerous furrows like some\r\nhuge lava-table. The blue Coast Range was seen stretching along the sky\r\nlike a beveled wall, and the somber, craggy Marysville Buttes rose\r\nimpressively out of the flooded plain like islands out of the sea. Then\r\nthe rain began to abate and I sauntered down through the dripping\r\nbushes reveling in the universal vigor and freshness that inspired all\r\nthe life about me. How clean and unworn and immortal the woods seemed\r\nto be!\xe2\x80\x94the lofty cedars in full bloom laden with golden pollen and\r\ntheir washed plumes shining; the pines rocking gently and settling back\r\ninto rest, and the evening sunbeams spangling on the broad leaves of\r\nthe madro\xc3\xb1os, their tracery of yellow boughs relieved against dusky\r\nthickets of Chestnut Oak; liverworts, lycopodiums, ferns were exulting\r\nin glorious revival, and every moss that had ever lived seemed to be\r\ncoming crowding back from the dead to clothe each trunk and stone in\r\nliving green. The steaming ground seemed fairly to throb and tingle\r\nwith life; smilax, fritillaria, saxifrage, and young violets were\r\npushing up as if already conscious of the summer glory, and innumerable\r\ngreen and yellow buds were peeping and smiling everywhere.\r\n\r\nAs for the birds and squirrels, not a wing or tail of them was to be\r\nseen while the storm was blowing. Squirrels dislike wet weather more\r\nthan cats do; therefore they were at home rocking in their dry nests.\r\nThe birds were hiding in the dells out of the wind, some of the\r\nstrongest of them pecking at acorns and manzanita berries, but most\r\nwere perched on low twigs, their breast feathers puffed out and keeping\r\none another company through the hard time as best they could.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at the village about sundown, the good people bestirred\r\nthemselves, pitying my bedraggled condition as if I were some benumbed\r\ncastaway snatched from the sea, while I, in turn, warm with excitement\r\nand reeking like the ground, pitied them for being dry and defrauded of\r\nall the glory that Nature had spread round about them that day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\nSIERRA THUNDER-STORMS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weather of spring and summer in the middle region of the Sierra is\r\nusually well flecked with rains and light dustings of snow, most of\r\nwhich are far too obviously joyful and life-giving to be regarded as\r\nstorms; and in the picturesque beauty and clearness of outlines of\r\ntheir clouds they offer striking contrasts to those boundless,\r\nall-embracing cloud-mantles of the storms of winter. The smallest and\r\nmost perfectly individualized specimens present a richly modeled\r\ncumulous cloud rising above the dark woods, about 11 A.M., swelling\r\nwith a visible motion straight up into the calm, sunny sky to a height\r\nof 12,000 to 14,000 feet above the sea, its white, pearly bosses\r\nrelieved by gray and pale purple shadows in the hollows, and showing\r\noutlines as keenly defined as those of the glacier-polished domes. In\r\nless than an hour it attains full development and stands poised in the\r\nblazing sunshine like some colossal mountain, as beautiful in form and\r\nfinish as if it were to become a permanent addition to the landscape.\r\nPresently a thunderbolt crashes through the crisp air, ringing like\r\nsteel on steel, sharp and clear, its startling detonation breaking into\r\na spray of echoes against the cliffs and ca\xc3\xb1on walls. Then down comes a\r\ncataract of rain. The big drops sift through the pine-needles, plash\r\nand patter on the granite pavements, and pour down the sides of ridges\r\nand domes in a network of gray, bubbling rills. In a few minutes the\r\ncloud withers to a mesh of dim filaments and disappears, leaving the\r\nsky perfectly clear and bright, every dust-particle wiped and washed\r\nout of it. Everything is refreshed and invigorated, a steam of\r\nfragrance rises, and the storm is finished\xe2\x80\x94one cloud, one\r\nlightning-stroke, and one dash of rain. This is the Sierra mid-summer\r\nthunder-storm reduced to its lowest terms. But some of them attain much\r\nlarger proportions, and assume a grandeur and energy of expression\r\nhardly surpassed by those bred in the depths of winter, producing those\r\nsudden floods called \xe2\x80\x9ccloud-bursts,\xe2\x80\x9d which are local, and to a\r\nconsiderable extent periodical, for they appear nearly every day about\r\nthe same time for weeks, usually about eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and lasting from\r\nfive minutes to an hour or two. One soon becomes so accustomed to see\r\nthem that the noon sky seems empty and abandoned without them, as if\r\nNature were forgetting something. When the glorious pearl and alabaster\r\nclouds of these noonday storms are being built I never give attention\r\nto anything else. No mountain or mountain-range, however divinely\r\nclothed with light, has a more enduring charm than those fleeting\r\nmountains of the sky\xe2\x80\x94floating fountains bearing water for every well,\r\nthe angels of the streams and lakes; brooding in the deep azure, or\r\nsweeping softly along the ground over ridge and dome, over meadow, over\r\nforest, over garden and grove; lingering with cooling shadows,\r\nrefreshing every flower, and soothing rugged rock-brows with a\r\ngentleness of touch and gesture wholly divine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIDAL VEIL FALLS, YOSEMITE VALLEY.]\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful and imposing of the summer storms rise just above\r\nthe upper edge of the Silver Fir zone, and all are so beautiful that it\r\nis not easy to choose any one for particular description. The one that\r\nI remember best fell on the mountains near Yosemite Valley, July 19,\r\n1869, while I was encamped in the Silver Fir woods. A range of bossy\r\ncumuli took possession of the sky, huge domes and peaks rising one\r\nbeyond another with deep ca\xc3\xb1ons between them, bending this way and that\r\nin long curves and reaches, interrupted here and there with white\r\nupboiling masses that looked like the spray of waterfalls. Zigzag\r\nlances of lightning followed each other in quick succession, and the\r\nthunder was so gloriously loud and massive it seemed as if surely an\r\nentire mountain was being shattered at every stroke. Only the trees\r\nwere touched, however, so far as I could see,\xe2\x80\x94a few firs 200 feet high,\r\nperhaps, and five to six feet in diameter, were split into long rails\r\nand slivers from top to bottom and scattered to all points of the\r\ncompass. Then came the rain in a hearty flood, covering the ground and\r\nmaking it shine with a continuous sheet of water that, like a\r\ntransparent film or skin, fitted closely down over all the rugged\r\nanatomy of the landscape.\r\n\r\nIt is not long, geologically speaking, since the first raindrop fell on\r\nthe present landscapes of the Sierra; and in the few tens of thousands\r\nof years of stormy cultivation they have been blest with, how beautiful\r\nthey have become! The first rains fell on raw, crumbling moraines and\r\nrocks without a plant. Now scarcely a drop can fail to find a beautiful\r\nmark: on the tops of the peaks, on the smooth glacier pavements, on the\r\ncurves of the domes, on moraines full of crystals, on the thousand\r\nforms of yosemitic sculpture with their tender beauty of balmy, flowery\r\nvegetation, laving, plashing, glinting, pattering; some falling softly\r\non meadows, creeping out of sight, seeking and finding every thirsty\r\nrootlet, some through the spires of the woods, sifting in dust through\r\nthe needles, and whispering good cheer to each of them; some falling\r\nwith blunt tapping sounds, drumming on the broad leaves of veratrum,\r\ncypripedium, saxifrage; some falling straight into fragrant corollas,\r\nkissing the lips of lilies, glinting on the sides of crystals, on\r\nshining grains of gold; some falling into the fountains of snow to\r\nswell their well-saved stores; some into the lakes and rivers, patting\r\nthe smooth glassy levels, making dimples and bells and spray, washing\r\nthe mountain windows, washing the wandering winds; some plashing into\r\nthe heart of snowy falls and cascades as if eager to join in the dance\r\nand the song and beat the foam yet finer. Good work and happy work for\r\nthe merry mountain raindrops, each one of them a brave fall in itself,\r\nrushing from the cliffs and hollows of the clouds into the cliffs and\r\nhollows of the mountains; away from the thunder of the sky into the\r\nthunder of the roaring rivers. And how far they have to go, and how\r\nmany cups to fill\xe2\x80\x94cassiope-cups, holding half a drop, and lake basins\r\nbetween the hills, each replenished with equal care\xe2\x80\x94every drop God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmessenger sent on its way with glorious pomp and display of\r\npower\xe2\x80\x94silvery new-born stars with lake and river, mountain and\r\nvalley\xe2\x80\x94all that the landscape holds\xe2\x80\x94reflected in their crystal depths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\nTHE WATER-OUZEL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe waterfalls of the Sierra are frequented by only one bird,\xe2\x80\x94the Ouzel\r\nor Water Thrush (_Cinclus Mexicanus_, SW.). He is a singularly joyous\r\nand lovable little fellow, about the size of a robin, clad in a plain\r\nwaterproof suit of bluish gray, with a tinge of chocolate on the head\r\nand shoulders. In form he is about as smoothly plump and compact as a\r\npebble that has been whirled in a pot-hole, the flowing contour of his\r\nbody being interrupted only by his strong feet and bill, the crisp\r\nwing-tips, and the up-slanted wren-like tail. Among all the countless\r\nwaterfalls I have met in the course of ten years\xe2\x80\x99 exploration in the\r\nSierra, whether among the icy peaks, or warm foot-hills, or in the\r\nprofound yosemitic ca\xc3\xb1ons of the middle region, not one was found\r\nwithout its Ouzel. No ca\xc3\xb1on is too cold for this little bird, none too\r\nlonely, provided it be rich in falling water. Find a fall, or cascade,\r\nor rushing rapid, anywhere upon a clear stream, and there you will\r\nsurely find its complementary Ouzel, flitting about in the spray,\r\ndiving in foaming eddies, whirling like a leaf among beaten foam-bells;\r\never vigorous and enthusiastic, yet self-contained, and neither seeking\r\nnor shunning your company.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATER-OUZEL DIVING AND FEEDING.]\r\n\r\nIf disturbed while dipping about in the margin shallows, he either sets\r\noff with a rapid whir to some other feeding-ground up or down the\r\nstream, or alights on some half-submerged rock or snag out in the\r\ncurrent, and immediately begins to nod and courtesy like a wren,\r\nturning his head from side to side with many other odd dainty movements\r\nthat never fail to fix the attention of the observer.\r\n\r\nHe is the mountain streams\xe2\x80\x99 own darling, the humming-bird of blooming\r\nwaters, loving rocky ripple-slopes and sheets of foam as a bee loves\r\nflowers, as a lark loves sunshine and meadows. Among all the mountain\r\nbirds, none has cheered me so much in my lonely wanderings,\xe2\x80\x94none so\r\nunfailingly. For both in winter and summer he sings, sweetly, cheerily,\r\nindependent alike of sunshine and of love, requiring no other\r\ninspiration than the stream on which he dwells. While water sings, so\r\nmust he, in heat or cold, calm or storm, ever attuning his voice in\r\nsure accord; low in the drought of summer and the drought of winter,\r\nbut never silent.\r\n\r\nDuring the golden days of Indian summer, after most of the snow has\r\nbeen melted, and the mountain streams have become feeble,\xe2\x80\x94a succession\r\nof silent pools, linked together by shallow, transparent currents and\r\nstrips of silvery lacework,\xe2\x80\x94then the song of the Ouzel is at its lowest\r\nebb. But as soon as the winter clouds have bloomed, and the mountain\r\ntreasuries are once more replenished with snow, the voices of the\r\nstreams and ouzels increase in strength and richness until the flood\r\nseason of early summer. Then the torrents chant their noblest anthems,\r\nand then is the flood-time of our songster\xe2\x80\x99s melody. As for weather,\r\ndark days and sun days are the same to him. The voices of most\r\nsong-birds, however joyous, suffer a long winter eclipse; but the Ouzel\r\nsings on through all the seasons and every kind of storm. Indeed no\r\nstorm can be more violent than those of the waterfalls in the midst of\r\nwhich he delights to dwell. However dark and boisterous the weather,\r\nsnowing, blowing, or cloudy, all the same he sings, and with never a\r\nnote of sadness. No need of spring sunshine to thaw _his_ song, for it\r\nnever freezes. Never shall you hear anything wintry from _his_ warm\r\nbreast; no pinched cheeping, no wavering notes between sorrow and joy;\r\nhis mellow, fluty voice is ever tuned to downright gladness, as free\r\nfrom dejection as cock-crowing.\r\n\r\nIt is pitiful to see wee frost-pinched sparrows on cold mornings in the\r\nmountain groves shaking the snow from their feathers, and hopping about\r\nas if anxious to be cheery, then hastening back to their hidings out of\r\nthe wind, puffing out their breast-feathers over their toes, and\r\nsubsiding among the leaves, cold and breakfastless, while the snow\r\ncontinues to fall, and there is no sign of clearing. But the Ouzel\r\nnever calls forth a single touch of pity; not because he is strong to\r\nendure, but rather because he seems to live a charmed life beyond the\r\nreach of every influence that makes endurance necessary.\r\n\r\nOne wild winter morning, when Yosemite Valley was swept its length from\r\nwest to east by a cordial snow-storm, I sallied forth to see what I\r\nmight learn and enjoy. A sort of gray, gloaming-like darkness filled\r\nthe valley, the huge walls were out of sight, all ordinary sounds were\r\nsmothered, and even the loudest booming of the falls was at times\r\nburied beneath the roar of the heavy-laden blast. The loose snow was\r\nalready over five feet deep on the meadows, making extended walks\r\nimpossible without the aid of snow-shoes. I found no great difficulty,\r\nhowever, in making my way to a certain ripple on the river where one of\r\nmy ouzels lived. He was at home, busily gleaning his breakfast among\r\nthe pebbles of a shallow portion of the margin, apparently unaware of\r\nanything extraordinary in the weather. Presently he flew out to a stone\r\nagainst which the icy current was beating, and turning his back to the\r\nwind, sang as delightfully as a lark in springtime.\r\n\r\nAfter spending an hour or two with my favorite, I made my way across\r\nthe valley, boring and wallowing through the drifts, to learn as\r\ndefinitely as possible how the other birds were spending their time.\r\nThe Yosemite birds are easily found during the winter because all of\r\nthem excepting the Ouzel are restricted to the sunny north side of the\r\nvalley, the south side being constantly eclipsed by the great frosty\r\nshadow of the wall. And because the Indian Ca\xc3\xb1on groves, from their\r\npeculiar exposure, are the warmest, the birds congregate there, more\r\nespecially in severe weather.\r\n\r\nI found most of the robins cowering on the lee side of the larger\r\nbranches where the snow could not fall upon them, while two or three of\r\nthe more enterprising were making desperate efforts to reach the\r\nmistletoe berries by clinging nervously to the under side of the\r\nsnow-crowned masses, back downward, like woodpeckers. Every now and\r\nthen they would dislodge some of the loose fringes of the snow-crown,\r\nwhich would come sifting down on them and send them screaming back to\r\ncamp, where they would subside among their companions with a shiver,\r\nmuttering in low, querulous chatter like hungry children.\r\n\r\nSome of the sparrows were busy at the feet of the larger trees gleaning\r\nseeds and benumbed insects, joined now and then by a robin weary of his\r\nunsuccessful attempts upon the snow-covered berries. The brave\r\nwoodpeckers were clinging to the snowless sides of the larger boles and\r\noverarching branches of the camp trees, making short nights from side\r\nto side of the grove, pecking now and then at the acorns they had\r\nstored in the bark, and chattering aimlessly as if unable to keep\r\nstill, yet evidently putting in the time in a very dull way, like\r\nstorm-bound travelers at a country tavern. The hardy nut-hatches were\r\nthreading the open furrows of the trunks in their usual industrious\r\nmanner, and uttering their quaint notes, evidently less distressed than\r\ntheir neighbors. The Steller jays were of course making more noisy stir\r\nthan all the other birds combined; ever coming and going with loud\r\nbluster, screaming as if each had a lump of melting sludge in his\r\nthroat, and taking good care to improve the favorable opportunity\r\nafforded by the storm to steal from the acorn stores of the\r\nwoodpeckers. I also noticed one solitary gray eagle braving the storm\r\non the top of a tall pine-stump just outside the main grove. He was\r\nstanding bolt upright with his back to the wind, a tuft of snow piled\r\non his square shoulders, a monument of passive endurance. Thus every\r\nsnow-bound bird seemed more or less uncomfortable if not in positive\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\nThe storm was reflected in every gesture, and not one cheerful note,\r\nnot to say song, came from a single bill; their cowering, joyless\r\nendurance offering a striking contrast to the spontaneous,\r\nirrepressible gladness of the Ouzel, who could no more help exhaling\r\nsweet song than a rose sweet fragrance. He _must_ sing though the\r\nheavens fall. I remember noticing the distress of a pair of robins\r\nduring the violent earthquake of the year 1872, when the pines of the\r\nValley, with strange movements, flapped and waved their branches, and\r\nbeetling rock-brows came thundering down to the meadows in tremendous\r\navalanches. It did not occur to me in the midst of the excitement of\r\nother observations to look for the ouzels, but I doubt not they were\r\nsinging straight on through it all, regarding the terrible rock-thunder\r\nas fearlessly as they do the booming of the waterfalls.\r\n\r\nWhat may be regarded as the separate songs of the Ouzel are exceedingly\r\ndifficult of description, because they are so variable and at the same\r\ntime so confluent. Though I have been acquainted with my favorite ten\r\nyears, and during most of this time have heard him sing nearly every\r\nday, I still detect notes and strains that seem new to me. Nearly all\r\nof his music is sweet and tender, lapsing from his round breast like\r\nwater over the smooth lip of a pool, then breaking farther on into a\r\nsparkling foam of melodious notes, which, glow with subdued enthusiasm,\r\nyet without expressing much of the strong, gushing ecstasy of the\r\nbobolink or skylark.\r\n\r\nThe more striking strains are perfect arabesques of melody, composed of\r\na few full, round, mellow notes, embroidered with delicate trills which\r\nfade and melt in long slender cadences. In a general way his music is\r\nthat of the streams refined and spiritualized. The deep booming notes\r\nof the falls are in it, the trills of rapids, the gurgling of margin\r\neddies, the low whispering of level reaches, and the sweet tinkle of\r\nseparate drops oozing from the ends of mosses and falling into tranquil\r\npools.\r\n\r\nThe Ouzel never sings in chorus with other birds, nor with his kind,\r\nbut only with the streams. And like flowers that bloom beneath the\r\nsurface of the ground, some of our favorite\xe2\x80\x99s best song-blossoms never\r\nrise above the surface of the heavier music of the water. I have often\r\nobserved him singing in the midst of beaten spray, his music completely\r\nburied beneath the water\xe2\x80\x99s roar; yet I knew he was surely singing by\r\nhis gestures and the movements of his bill.\r\n\r\nHis food, as far as I have noticed, consists of all kinds of water\r\ninsects, which in summer are chiefly procured along shallow margins.\r\nHere he wades about ducking his head under water and deftly turning\r\nover pebbles and fallen leaves with his bill, seldom choosing to go\r\ninto deep water where he has to use his wings in diving.\r\n\r\nHe seems to be especially fond of the larvae; of mosquitos, found in\r\nabundance attached to the bottom of smooth rock channels where the\r\ncurrent is shallow. When feeding in such places he wades up-stream, and\r\noften while his head is under water the swift current is deflected\r\nupward along the glossy curves of his neck and shoulders, in the form\r\nof a clear, crystalline shell, which fairly incloses him like a\r\nbell-glass, the shell being broken and re-formed as he lifts and dips\r\nhis head; while ever and anon he sidles out to where the too powerful\r\ncurrent carries him off his feet; then he dexterously rises on the wing\r\nand goes gleaning again in shallower places.\r\n\r\nBut during the winter, when the stream-banks are embossed in snow, and\r\nthe streams themselves are chilled nearly to the freezing-point, so\r\nthat the snow falling into them in stormy weather is not wholly\r\ndissolved, but forms a thin, blue sludge, thus rendering the current\r\nopaque\xe2\x80\x94then he seeks the deeper portions of the main rivers, where he\r\nmay dive to clear water beneath the sludge. Or he repairs to some open\r\nlake or mill-pond, at the bottom of which he feeds in safety.\r\n\r\nWhen thus compelled to betake himself to a lake, he does not plunge\r\ninto it at once like a duck, but always alights in the first place upon\r\nsome rock or fallen pine along the shore. Then flying out thirty or\r\nforty yards, more or less, according to the character of the bottom, he\r\nalights with a dainty glint on the surface, swims about, looks down,\r\nfinally makes up his mind, and disappears with a sharp stroke of his\r\nwings. After feeding for two or three minutes he suddenly reappears,\r\nshowers the water from his wings with one vigorous shake, and rises\r\nabruptly into the air as if pushed up from beneath, comes back to his\r\nperch, sings a few minutes, and goes out to dive again; thus coming and\r\ngoing, singing and diving at the same place for hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE LATE-SUMMER FEEDING-GROUNDS OF THE OUZEL.]\r\n\r\nThe Ouzel is usually found singly; rarely in pairs, excepting during\r\nthe breeding season, and _very_ rarely in threes or fours. I once\r\nobserved three thus spending a winter morning in company, upon a small\r\nglacier lake, on the Upper Merced, about 7500 feet above the level of\r\nthe sea. A storm had occurred during the night, but the morning sun\r\nshone unclouded, and the shadowy lake, gleaming darkly in its setting\r\nof fresh snow, lay smooth and motionless as a mirror. My camp chanced\r\nto be within a few feet of the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge, opposite a fallen pine,\r\nsome of the branches of which leaned out over the lake. Here my three\r\ndearly welcome visitors took up their station, and at once began to\r\nembroider the frosty air with their delicious melody, doubly delightful\r\nto me that particular morning, as I had been somewhat apprehensive of\r\ndanger in breaking my way down through the snow-choked ca\xc3\xb1ons to the\r\nlowlands.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the lake bottom selected for a feeding-ground lies at a\r\ndepth of fifteen or twenty feet below the surface, and is covered with\r\na short growth of algae and other aquatic plants,\xe2\x80\x94facts I had\r\npreviously determined while sailing over it on a raft. After alighting\r\non the glassy surface, they occasionally indulged in a little play,\r\nchasing one another round about in small circles; then all three would\r\nsuddenly dive together, and then come ashore and sing.\r\n\r\nThe Ouzel seldom swims more than a few yards on the surface, for, not\r\nbeing web-footed, he makes rather slow progress, but by means of his\r\nstrong, crisp wings he swims, or rather flies, with celerity under the\r\nsurface, often to considerable distances. But it is in withstanding the\r\nforce of heavy rapids that his strength of wing in this respect is most\r\nstrikingly manifested. The following may be regarded as a fair\r\nillustration of his power of sub-aquatic flight. One stormy morning in\r\nwinter when the Merced River was blue and green with unmelted snow, I\r\nobserved one of my ouzels perched on a snag out in the midst of a\r\nswift-rushing rapid, singing cheerily, as if everything was just to his\r\nmind; and while I stood on the bank admiring him, he suddenly plunged\r\ninto the sludgy current, leaving his song abruptly broken off. After\r\nfeeding a minute or two at the bottom, and when one would suppose that\r\nhe must inevitably be swept far down-stream, he emerged just where he\r\nwent down, alighted on the same snag, showered the water-beads from his\r\nfeathers, and continued his unfinished song, seemingly in tranquil ease\r\nas if it had suffered no interruption.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUZEL ENTERING A WHITE CURRENT.]\r\n\r\nThe Ouzel alone of all birds dares to enter a white torrent. And though\r\nstrictly terrestrial in structure, no other is so inseparably related\r\nto water, not even the duck, or the bold ocean albatross, or the\r\nstormy-petrel. For ducks go ashore as soon as they finish feeding in\r\nundisturbed places, and very often make long flights over land from\r\nlake to lake or field to field. The same is true of most other aquatic\r\nbirds. But the Ouzel, born on the brink of a stream, or on a snag or\r\nboulder in the midst of it, seldom leaves it for a single moment. For,\r\nnotwithstanding he is often on the wing, he never flies overland, but\r\nwhirs with, rapid, quail-like beat above the stream, tracing all its\r\nwindings. Even when the stream is quite small, say from five to ten\r\nfeet wide, he seldom shortens his flight by crossing a bend, however\r\nabrupt it may be; and even when disturbed by meeting some one on the\r\nbank, he prefers to fly over one\xe2\x80\x99s head, to dodging out over the\r\nground. When, therefore, his flight along a crooked stream is viewed\r\nendwise, it appears most strikingly wavered\xe2\x80\x94a description on the air of\r\nevery curve with lightning-like rapidity.\r\n\r\nThe vertical curves and angles of the most precipitous torrents he\r\ntraces with the same rigid fidelity, swooping down the inclines of\r\ncascades, dropping sheer over dizzy falls amid the spray, and ascending\r\nwith the same fearlessness and ease, seldom seeking to lessen the\r\nsteepness of the acclivity by beginning to ascend before reaching the\r\nbase of the fall. No matter though it may be several hundred feet in\r\nheight he holds straight on, as if about to dash headlong into the\r\nthrong of booming rockets, then darts abruptly upward, and, after\r\nalighting at the top of the precipice to rest a moment, proceeds to\r\nfeed and sing. His flight is solid and impetuous, without any\r\nintermission of wing-beats,\xe2\x80\x94one homogeneous buzz like that of a laden\r\nbee on its way home. And while thus buzzing freely from fall to fall,\r\nhe is frequently heard giving utterance to a long outdrawn train of\r\nunmodulated notes, in no way connected with his song, but corresponding\r\nclosely with his flight in sustained vigor.\r\n\r\nWere the flights of all the ouzels in the Sierra traced on a chart,\r\nthey would indicate the direction of the flow of the entire system of\r\nancient glaciers, from about the period of the breaking up of the\r\nice-sheet until near the close of the glacial winter; because the\r\nstreams which the ouzels so rigidly follow are, with the unimportant\r\nexceptions of a few side tributaries, all flowing in channels eroded\r\nfor them out of the solid flank of the range by the vanished\r\nglaciers,\xe2\x80\x94the streams tracing the ancient glaciers, the ouzels tracing\r\nthe streams. Nor do we find so complete compliance to glacial\r\nconditions in the life of any other mountain bird, or animal of any\r\nkind. Bears frequently accept the pathways laid down by glaciers as the\r\neasiest to travel; but they often leave them and cross over from ca\xc3\xb1on\r\nto ca\xc3\xb1on. So also, most of the birds trace the moraines to some extent,\r\nbecause the forests are growing on them. But they wander far, crossing\r\nthe ca\xc3\xb1ons from grove to grove, and draw exceedingly angular and\r\ncomplicated courses.\r\n\r\nThe Ouzel\xe2\x80\x99s nest is one of the most extraordinary pieces of bird\r\narchitecture I ever saw, odd and novel in design, perfectly fresh and\r\nbeautiful, and in every way worthy of the genius of the little builder.\r\nIt is about a foot in diameter, round and bossy in outline, with a\r\nneatly arched opening near the bottom, somewhat like an old-fashioned\r\nbrick oven, or Hottentot\xe2\x80\x99s hut. It is built almost exclusively of green\r\nand yellow mosses, chiefly the beautiful fronded hypnum that covers the\r\nrocks and old drift-logs in the vicinity of waterfalls. These are\r\ndeftly interwoven, and felted together into a charming little hut; and\r\nso situated that many of the outer mosses continue to flourish as if\r\nthey had not been plucked. A few fine, silky-stemmed grasses are\r\noccasionally found interwoven with the mosses, but, with the exception\r\nof a thin layer lining the floor, their presence seems accidental, as\r\nthey are of a species found growing with the mosses and are probably\r\nplucked with them. The site chosen for this curious mansion is usually\r\nsome little rock-shelf within reach of the lighter particles of the\r\nspray of a waterfall, so that its walls are kept green and growing, at\r\nleast during the time of high water.\r\n\r\nNo harsh lines are presented by any portion of the nest as seen in\r\nplace, but when removed from its shelf, the back and bottom, and\r\nsometimes a portion of the top, is found quite sharply angular, because\r\nit is made to conform to the surface of the rock upon which and against\r\nwhich it is built, the little architect always taking advantage of\r\nslight crevices and protuberances that may chance to offer, to render\r\nhis structure stable by means of a kind of gripping and dovetailing.\r\n\r\nIn choosing a building-spot, concealment does not seem to be taken into\r\nconsideration; yet notwithstanding the nest is large and guilelessly\r\nexposed to view, it is far from being easily detected, chiefly because\r\nit swells forward like any other bulging moss-cushion growing naturally\r\nin such situations. This is more especially the case where the nest is\r\nkept fresh by being well sprinkled. Sometimes these romantic little\r\nhuts have their beauty enhanced by rock-ferns and grasses that spring\r\nup around the mossy walls, or in front of the door-sill, dripping with\r\ncrystal beads.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, at certain hours of the day, when the sunshine is poured\r\ndown at the required angle, the whole mass of the spray enveloping the\r\nfairy establishment is brilliantly irised; and it is through so\r\nglorious a rainbow atmosphere as this that some of our blessed ouzels\r\nobtain their first peep at the world.\r\n\r\nOuzels seem so completely part and parcel of the streams they inhabit,\r\nthey scarce suggest any other origin than the streams themselves; and\r\none might almost be pardoned in fancying they come direct from the\r\nliving waters, like flowers from the ground. At least, from whatever\r\ncause, it never occurred to me to look for their nests until more than\r\na year after I had made the acquaintance of the birds themselves,\r\nalthough I found one the very day on which I began the search. In\r\nmaking my way from Yosemite to the glaciers at the heads of the Merced\r\nand Tuolumne rivers, I camped in a particularly wild and romantic\r\nportion of the Nevada ca\xc3\xb1on where in previous excursions I had never\r\nfailed to enjoy the company of my favorites, who were attracted here,\r\nno doubt, by the safe nesting-places in the shelving rocks, and by the\r\nabundance of food and falling water. The river, for miles above and\r\nbelow, consists of a succession of small falls from ten to sixty feet\r\nin height, connected by flat, plume-like cascades that go flashing from\r\nfall to fall, free and almost channelless, over waving folds of\r\nglacier-polished granite.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of one of the falls, that portion of the precipice\r\nwhich is bathed by the spray presents a series of little shelves and\r\ntablets caused by the development of planes of cleavage in the granite,\r\nand by the consequent fall of masses through the action of the water.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow here,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cof all places, is the most charming spot for an\r\nOuzel\xe2\x80\x99s nest.\xe2\x80\x9d Then carefully scanning the fretted face of the\r\nprecipice through the spray, I at length noticed a yellowish\r\nmoss-cushion, growing on the edge of a level tablet within five or six\r\nfeet of the outer folds of the fall. But apart from the fact of its\r\nbeing situated where one acquainted with the lives of ouzels would\r\nfancy an Ouzel\xe2\x80\x99s nest ought to be, there was nothing in its appearance\r\nvisible at first sight, to distinguish it from other bosses of\r\nrock-moss similarly situated with reference to perennial spray; and it\r\nwas not until I had scrutinized it again and again, and had removed my\r\nshoes and stockings and crept along the face of the rock within eight\r\nor ten feet of it, that I could decide certainly whether it was a nest\r\nor a natural growth.\r\n\r\nIn these moss huts three or four eggs are laid, white like\r\nfoam-bubbles; and well may the little birds hatched from them sing\r\nwater songs, for they hear them all their lives, and even before they\r\nare born.\r\n\r\nI have often observed the young just out of the nest making their odd\r\ngestures, and seeming in every way as much at home as their experienced\r\nparents, like young bees on their first excursions to the flower\r\nfields. No amount of familiarity with people and their ways seems to\r\nchange them in the least. To all appearance their behavior is just the\r\nsame on seeing a man for the first time, as when they have seen him\r\nfrequently.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OUZEL AT HOME.]\r\n\r\nOn the lower reaches of the rivers where mills are built, they sing on\r\nthrough the din of the machinery, and all the noisy confusion of dogs,\r\ncattle, and workmen. On one occasion, while a wood-chopper was at work\r\non the river-bank, I observed one cheerily singing within reach of the\r\nflying chips. Nor does any kind of unwonted disturbance put him in bad\r\nhumor, or frighten him out of calm self-possession. In passing through\r\na narrow gorge, I once drove one ahead of me from rapid to rapid,\r\ndisturbing him four times in quick succession where he could not very\r\nwell fly past me on account of the narrowness of the channel. Most\r\nbirds under similar circumstances fancy themselves pursued, and become\r\nsuspiciously uneasy; but, instead of growing nervous about it, he made\r\nhis usual dippings, and sang one of his most tranquil strains. When\r\nobserved within a few yards their eyes are seen to express remarkable\r\ngentleness and intelligence; but they seldom allow so near a view\r\nunless one wears clothing of about the same color as the rocks and\r\ntrees, and knows how to sit still. On one occasion, while rambling\r\nalong the shore of a mountain lake, where the birds, at least those\r\nborn that season, had never seen a man, I sat down to rest on a large\r\nstone close to the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge, upon which it seemed the ouzels and\r\nsandpipers were in the habit of alighting when they came to feed on\r\nthat part of the shore, and some of the other birds also, when they\r\ncame down to wash or drink. In a few minutes, along came a whirring\r\nOuzel and alighted on the stone beside me, within reach of my hand.\r\nThen suddenly observing me, he stooped nervously as if about to fly on\r\nthe instant, but as I remained as motionless as the stone, he gained\r\nconfidence, and looked me steadily in the face for about a minute, then\r\nflew quietly to the outlet and began to sing. Next came a sandpiper and\r\ngazed at me with much the same guileless expression of eye as the\r\nOuzel. Lastly, down with a swoop came a Steller\xe2\x80\x99s jay out of a\r\nfir-tree, probably with the intention of moistening his noisy throat.\r\nBut instead of sitting confidingly as my other visitors had done, he\r\nrushed off at once, nearly tumbling heels over head into the lake in\r\nhis suspicious confusion, and with loud screams roused the\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nLove for song-birds, with their sweet human voices, appears to be more\r\ncommon and unfailing than love for flowers. Every one loves flowers to\r\nsome extent, at least in life\xe2\x80\x99s fresh morning, attracted by them as\r\ninstinctively as humming-birds and bees. Even the young Digger Indians\r\nhave sufficient love for the brightest of those found growing on the\r\nmountains to gather them and braid them, as decorations for the hair.\r\nAnd I was glad to discover, through the few Indians that could be\r\ninduced to talk on the subject, that they have names for the wild rose\r\nand the lily, and other conspicuous flowers, whether available as food\r\nor otherwise. Most men, however, whether savage or civilized, become\r\napathetic toward all plants that have no other apparent use than the\r\nuse of beauty. But fortunately one\xe2\x80\x99s first instinctive love of\r\nsong-birds is never wholly obliterated, no matter what the influences\r\nupon our lives may be. I have often been delighted to see a pure,\r\nspiritual glow come into the countenances of hard business-men and old\r\nminers, when a song-bird chanced to alight near them. Nevertheless, the\r\nlittle mouthful of meat that swells out the breasts of some song-birds\r\nis too often the cause of their death. Larks and robins in particular\r\nare brought to market in hundreds. But fortunately the Ouzel has no\r\nenemy so eager to eat his little body as to follow him into the\r\nmountain solitudes. I never knew him to be chased even by hawks.\r\n\r\nAn acquaintance of mine, a sort of foot-hill mountaineer, had a pet\r\ncat, a great, dozy, overgrown creature, about as broad-shouldered as a\r\nlynx. During the winter, while the snow lay deep, the mountaineer sat\r\nin his lonely cabin among the pines smoking his pipe and wearing the\r\ndull time away. Tom was his sole companion, sharing his bed, and\r\nsitting beside him on a stool with much the same drowsy expression of\r\neye as his master. The good-natured bachelor was content with his hard\r\nfare of soda-bread and bacon, but Tom, the only creature in the world\r\nacknowledging dependence on him, must needs be provided with fresh\r\nmeat. Accordingly he bestirred himself to contrive squirrel-traps, and\r\nwaded the snowy woods with his gun, making sad havoc among the few\r\nwinter birds, sparing neither robin, sparrow, nor tiny nuthatch, and\r\nthe pleasure of seeing Tom eat and grow fat was his great reward.\r\n\r\nOne cold afternoon, while hunting along the river-bank, he noticed a\r\nplain-feathered little bird skipping about in the shallows, and\r\nimmediately raised his gun. But just then the confiding songster began\r\nto sing, and after listening to his summery melody the charmed hunter\r\nturned away, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cBless your little heart, I can\xe2\x80\x99t shoot you, not\r\neven for Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YOSEMITE BIRDS, SNOW-BOUND AT THE FOOT OF INDIAN\r\nCA\xc3\x91ON.]\r\n\r\nEven so far north as icy Alaska, I have found my glad singer. When I\r\nwas exploring the glaciers between Mount Fairweather and the Stikeen\r\nRiver, one cold day in November, after trying in vain to force a way\r\nthrough the innumerable icebergs of Sum Dum Bay to the great glaciers\r\nat the head of it, I was weary and baffled and sat resting in my canoe\r\nconvinced at last that I would have to leave this part of my work for\r\nanother year. Then I began to plan my escape to open water before the\r\nyoung ice which was beginning to form should shut me in. While I thus\r\nlingered drifting with the bergs, in the midst of these gloomy\r\nforebodings and all the terrible glacial desolation and grandeur, I\r\nsuddenly heard the well-known whir of an Ouzel\xe2\x80\x99s wings, and, looking\r\nup, saw my little comforter coming straight across the ice from the\r\nshore. In a second or two he was with me, flying three times round my\r\nhead with a happy salute, as if saying, \xe2\x80\x9cCheer up, old friend; you see\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m here, and all\xe2\x80\x99s well.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he flew back to the shore, alighted on\r\nthe topmost jag of a stranded iceberg, and began to nod and bow as\r\nthough he were on one of his favorite boulders in the midst of a sunny\r\nSierra cascade.\r\n\r\nThe species is distributed all along the mountain-ranges of the Pacific\r\nCoast from Alaska to Mexico, and east to the Rocky Mountains.\r\nNevertheless, it is as yet comparatively little known. Audubon and\r\nWilson did not meet it. Swainson was, I believe, the first naturalist\r\nto describe a specimen from Mexico. Specimens were shortly afterward\r\nprocured by Drummond near the sources of the Athabasca River, between\r\nthe fifty-fourth and fifty-sixth parallels; and it has been collected\r\nby nearly all of the numerous exploring expeditions undertaken of late\r\nthrough our Western States and Territories; for it never fails to\r\nengage the attention of naturalists in a very particular manner.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, is our little cinclus, beloved of every one who is so\r\nfortunate as to know him. Tracing on strong wing every curve of the\r\nmost precipitous torrents from one extremity of the Sierra to the\r\nother; not fearing to follow them through their darkest gorges and\r\ncoldest snow-tunnels; acquainted with every waterfall, echoing their\r\ndivine music; and throughout the whole of their beautiful lives\r\ninterpreting all that we in our unbelief call terrible in the\r\nutterances of torrents and storms, as only varied expressions of God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neternal love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\nTHE WILD SHEEP\r\n(_Ovis montana_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wild sheep ranks highest among the animal mountaineers of the\r\nSierra. Possessed of keen sight and scent, and strong limbs, he dwells\r\nsecure amid the loftiest summits, leaping unscathed from crag to crag,\r\nup and down the fronts of giddy precipices, crossing foaming torrents\r\nand slopes of frozen snow, exposed to the wildest storms, yet\r\nmaintaining a brave, warm life, and developing from generation to\r\ngeneration in perfect strength and beauty.\r\n\r\nNearly all the lofty mountain-chains of the globe are inhabited by wild\r\nsheep, most of which, on account of the remote and all but inaccessible\r\nregions where they dwell, are imperfectly known as yet. They are\r\nclassified by different naturalists under from five to ten distinct\r\nspecies or varieties, the best known being the burrhel of the Himalaya\r\n(_Ovis burrhel_, Blyth); the argali, the large wild sheep of central\r\nand northeastern Asia (_O. ammon_, Linn., or _Caprovis argali_); the\r\nCorsican mouflon (_O. musimon_, Pal.); the aoudad of the mountains of\r\nnorthern Africa (_Ammotragus tragelaphus_); and the Rocky Mountain\r\nbighorn (_O. montana_, Cuv.). To this last-named species belongs the\r\nwild sheep of the Sierra. Its range, according to the late Professor\r\nBaird of the Smithsonian Institution, extends \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the region of the\r\nupper Missouri and Yellowstone to the Rocky Mountains and the high\r\ngrounds adjacent to them on the eastern slope, and as far south as the\r\nRio Grande. Westward it extends to the coast ranges of Washington,\r\nOregon, and California, and follows the highlands some distance into\r\nMexico.\xe2\x80\x9d[1] Throughout the vast region bounded on the east by the\r\nWahsatch Mountains and on the west by the Sierra there are more than a\r\nhundred subordinate ranges and mountain groups, trending north and\r\nsouth, range beyond range, with summits rising from eight to twelve\r\nthousand feet above the level of the sea, probably all of which,\r\naccording to my own observations, is, or has been, inhabited by this\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nCompared with the argali, which, considering its size and the vast\r\nextent of its range, is probably the most important of all the wild\r\nsheep, our species is about the same size, but the horns are less\r\ntwisted and less divergent. The more important characteristics are,\r\nhowever, essentially the same, some of the best naturalists maintaining\r\nthat the two are only varied forms of one species. In accordance with\r\nthis view, Cuvier conjectures that since central Asia seems to be the\r\nregion where the sheep first appeared, and from which it has been\r\ndistributed, the argali may have been distributed over this continent\r\nfrom Asia by crossing Bering Strait on ice. This conjecture is not so\r\nill founded as at first sight would appear; for the Strait is only\r\nabout fifty miles wide, is interrupted by three islands, and is jammed\r\nwith ice nearly every winter. Furthermore the argali is abundant on the\r\nmountains adjacent to the Strait at East Cape, where it is well known\r\nto the Tschuckchi hunters and where I have seen many of their horns.\r\n\r\nOn account of the extreme variability of the sheep under culture, it is\r\ngenerally supposed that the innumerable domestic breeds have all been\r\nderived from the few wild species; but the whole question is involved\r\nin obscurity. According to Darwin, sheep have been domesticated from a\r\nvery ancient period, the remains of a small breed, differing from any\r\nnow known, having been found in the famous Swiss lake-dwellings.\r\n\r\nCompared with the best-known domestic breeds, we find that our wild\r\nspecies is much larger, and, instead of an all-wool garment, wears a\r\nthick over-coat of hair like that of the deer, and an under-covering of\r\nfine wool. The hair, though rather coarse, is comfortably soft and\r\nspongy, and lies smooth, as if carefully tended with comb and brush.\r\nThe predominant color during most of the year is brownish-gray, varying\r\nto bluish-gray in the autumn; the belly and a large, conspicuous patch\r\non the buttocks are white; and the tail, which is very short, like that\r\nof a deer, is black, with a yellowish border. The wool is white, and\r\ngrows in beautiful spirals down out of sight among the shining hair,\r\nlike delicate climbing vines among stalks of corn.\r\n\r\nThe horns of the male are of immense size, measuring in their greater\r\ndiameter from five to six and a half inches, and from two and a half to\r\nthree feet in length around the curve. They are yellowish-white in\r\ncolor, and ridged transversely, like those of the domestic ram. Their\r\ncross-section near the base is somewhat triangular in outline, and\r\nflattened toward the tip. Rising boldly from the top of the head, they\r\ncurve gently backward and outward, then forward and outward, until\r\nabout three fourths of a circle is described, and until the flattened,\r\nblunt tips are about two feet or two and a half feet apart. Those of\r\nthe female are flattened throughout their entire length, are less\r\ncurved than those of the male, and much smaller, measuring less than a\r\nfoot along the curve.\r\n\r\nA ram and ewe that I obtained near the Modoc lava-beds, to the\r\nnortheast of Mount Shasta, measured as follows:\r\n\r\n_Ram._ _Ewe._ \r\n_ft._ _in._ _ft._ _in._\r\nHeight at shoulders 3 6 3 0\r\nGirth around shoulders 3 11 3 3\xc2\xbe\r\nLength from nose to root of tail 5 10\xc2\xbc 4 3\xc2\xbd\r\nLength of ears 0 4\xc2\xbe 0 5\r\nLength of tail 0 4\xc2\xbd 0 4\xc2\xbd\r\nLength of horns around curve 2 9 0 11\xc2\xbd\r\nDistance across from tip to tip of horns 2 5\xc2\xbd  \r\nCircumference of horns at base 1 4 0 6\r\n\r\nThe measurements of a male obtained in the Rocky Mountains by Audubon\r\nvary but little as compared with the above. The weight of his specimen\r\nwas 344 pounds,[2] which is, perhaps, about an average for full-grown\r\nmales. The females are about a third lighter.\r\n\r\nBesides these differences in size, color, hair, etc., as noted above,\r\nwe may observe that the domestic sheep, in a general way, is\r\nexpressionless, like a dull bundle of something only half alive, while\r\nthe wild is as elegant and graceful as a deer, every movement\r\nmanifesting admirable strength and character. The tame is timid; the\r\nwild is bold. The tame is always more or less ruffled and dirty; while\r\nthe wild is as smooth and clean as the flowers of his mountain\r\npastures.\r\n\r\nThe earliest mention that I have been able to find of the wild sheep in\r\nAmerica is by Father Picolo, a Catholic missionary at Monterey, in the\r\nyear 1797, who, after describing it, oddly enough, as \xe2\x80\x9ca kind of deer\r\nwith a sheep-like head, and about as large as a calf one or two years\r\nold,\xe2\x80\x9d naturally hurries on to remark: \xe2\x80\x9cI have eaten of these beasts;\r\ntheir flesh is very tender and delicious.\xe2\x80\x9d Mackenzie, in his northern\r\ntravels, heard the species spoken of by the Indians as \xe2\x80\x9cwhite\r\nbuffaloes.\xe2\x80\x9d And Lewis and Clark tell us that, in a time of great\r\nscarcity on the head waters of the Missouri, they saw plenty of wild\r\nsheep, but they were \xe2\x80\x9ctoo shy to be shot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few of the more energetic of the Pah Ute Indians hunt the wild sheep\r\nevery season among the more accessible sections of the High Sierra, in\r\nthe neighborhood of passes, where, from having been pursued, they have\r\nbecome extremely wary; but in the rugged wilderness of peaks and\r\nca\xc3\xb1ons, where the foaming tributaries of the San Joaquin and King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrivers take their rise, they fear no hunter save the wolf, and are more\r\nguileless and approachable than their tame kindred.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in the work of exploring high regions where they delight\r\nto roam I have been greatly interested in studying their habits. In the\r\nmonths of November and December, and probably during a considerable\r\nportion of midwinter, they all flock together, male and female, old and\r\nyoung. I once found a complete band of this kind numbering upward of\r\nfifty, which, on being alarmed, went bounding away across a jagged\r\nlava-bed at admirable speed, led by a majestic old ram, with the lambs\r\nsafe in the middle of the flock.\r\n\r\nIn spring and summer, the full-grown rams form separate bands of from\r\nthree to twenty, and are usually found feeding along the edges of\r\nglacier meadows, or resting among the castle-like crags of the high\r\nsummits; and whether quietly feeding, or scaling the wild cliffs, their\r\nnoble forms and the power and beauty of their movements never fail to\r\nstrike the beholder with lively admiration.\r\n\r\nTheir resting-places seem to be chosen with reference to sunshine and a\r\nwide outlook, and most of all to safety. Their feeding-grounds are\r\namong the most beautiful of the wild gardens, bright with daisies and\r\ngentians and mats of purple bryanthus, lying hidden away on rocky\r\nheadlands and ca\xc3\xb1on sides, where sunshine is abundant, or down in the\r\nshady glacier valleys, along the banks of the streams and lakes, where\r\nthe plushy sod is greenest. Here they feast all summer, the happy\r\nwanderers, perhaps relishing the beauty as well as the taste of the\r\nlovely flora on which they feed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SNOW-BOUND ON MOUNT SHASTA.]\r\n\r\nWhen the winter storms set in, loading their highland pastures with\r\nsnow, then, like the birds, they gather and go to lower climates,\r\nusually descending the eastern flank of the range to the rough,\r\nvolcanic table-lands and treeless ranges of the Great Basin adjacent to\r\nthe Sierra. They never make haste, however, and seem to have no dread\r\nof storms, many of the strongest only going down leisurely to bare,\r\nwind-swept ridges, to feed on bushes and dry bunch-grass, and then\r\nreturning up into the snow. Once I was snow-bound on Mount Shasta for\r\nthree days, a little below the timber line. It was a dark and stormy\r\ntime, well calculated to test the skill and endurance of mountaineers.\r\nThe snow-laden gale drove on night and day in hissing, blinding floods,\r\nand when at length it began to abate, I found that a small band of wild\r\nsheep had weathered the storm in the lee of a clump of Dwarf Pines a\r\nfew yards above my storm-nest, where the snow was eight or ten feet\r\ndeep. I was warm back of a rock, with blankets, bread, and fire. My\r\nbrave companions lay in the snow, without food, and with only the\r\npartial shelter of the short trees, yet they made no sign of suffering\r\nor faint-heartedness.\r\n\r\nIn the months of May and June, the wild sheep bring forth their young\r\nin solitary and almost inaccessible crags, far above the nesting-rocks\r\nof the eagle. I have frequently come upon the beds of the ewes and\r\nlambs at an elevation of from 12,000 to 13,000 feet above sea-level.\r\nThese beds are simply oval-shaped hollows, pawed out among loose,\r\ndisintegrating rock-chips and sand, upon some sunny spot commanding a\r\ngood outlook, and partially sheltered from the winds that sweep those\r\nlofty peaks almost without intermission. Such is the cradle of the\r\nlittle mountaineer, aloft in the very sky; rocked in storms, curtained\r\nin clouds, sleeping in thin, icy air; but, wrapped in his hairy coat,\r\nand nourished by a strong, warm mother, defended from the talons of the\r\neagle and the teeth of the sly coyote, the bonny lamb grows apace. He\r\nsoon learns to nibble the tufted rock-grasses and leaves of the white\r\nspirsea; his horns begin to shoot, and before summer is done he is\r\nstrong and agile, and goes forth with the flock, watched by the same\r\ndivine love that tends the more helpless human lamb in its cradle by\r\nthe fireside.\r\n\r\nNothing is more commonly remarked by noisy, dusty trail-travelers in\r\nthe Sierra than the want of animal life\xe2\x80\x94no song-birds, no deer, no\r\nsquirrels, no game of any kind, they say. But if such could only go\r\naway quietly into the wilderness, sauntering afoot and alone with\r\nnatural deliberation, they would soon learn that these mountain\r\nmansions are not without inhabitants, many of whom, confiding and\r\ngentle, would not try to shun their acquaintance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEAD OF THE MERINO RAM (DOMESTIC).]\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1873 I was tracing the South Fork of the San Joaquin up\r\nits wild ca\xc3\xb1on to its farthest glacier fountains. It was the season of\r\nalpine Indian summer. The sun beamed lovingly; the squirrels were\r\nnutting in the pine-trees, butterflies hovered about the last of the\r\ngoldenrods, the willow and maple thickets were yellow, the meadows\r\nbrown, and the whole sunny, mellow landscape glowed like a countenance\r\nin the deepest and sweetest repose. On my way over the glacier-polished\r\nrocks along the river, I came to an expanded portion of the ca\xc3\xb1on,\r\nabout two miles long and half a mile wide, which formed a level park\r\ninclosed with picturesque granite walls like those of Yosemite Valley.\r\nDown through the middle of it poured the beautiful river shining and\r\nspangling in the golden light, yellow groves on its banks, and strips\r\nof brown meadow; while the whole park was astir with wild life, some of\r\nwhich even the noisiest and least observing of travelers must have seen\r\nhad they been with me. Deer, with their supple, well-grown fawns,\r\nbounded from thicket to thicket as I advanced; grouse kept rising from\r\nthe brown grass with a great whirring of wings, and, alighting on the\r\nlower branches of the pines and poplars, allowed a near approach, as if\r\ncurious to see me. Farther on, a broad-shouldered wildcat showed\r\nhimself, coming out of a grove, and crossing the river on a flood-jamb\r\nof logs, halting for a moment to look back. The bird-like tamias\r\nfrisked about my feet everywhere among the pine-needles and seedy\r\ngrass-tufts; cranes waded the shallows of the river-bends, the\r\nkingfisher rattled from perch to perch, and the blessed ouzel sang amid\r\nthe spray of every cascade. Where may lonely wanderer find a more\r\ninteresting family of mountain-dwellers, earth-born companions and\r\nfellow-mortals? It was afternoon when I joined them, and the glorious\r\nlandscape began to fade in the gloaming before I awoke from their\r\nenchantment. Then I sought a camp-ground on the river-bank, made a\r\ncupful of tea, and lay down to sleep on a smooth place among the yellow\r\nleaves of an aspen grove. Next day I discovered yet grander landscapes\r\nand grander life. Following the river over huge, swelling rock-bosses\r\nthrough a majestic ca\xc3\xb1on, and past innumerable cascades, the scenery in\r\ngeneral became gradually wilder and more alpine. The Sugar Pine and\r\nSilver Firs gave place to the hardier Cedar and Hemlock Spruce. The\r\nca\xc3\xb1on walls became more rugged and bare, and gentians and arctic\r\ndaisies became more abundant in the gardens and strips of meadow along\r\nthe streams. Toward the middle of the afternoon I came to another\r\nvalley, strikingly wild and original in all its features, and perhaps\r\nnever before touched by human foot. As regards area of level\r\nbottom-land, it is one of the very smallest of the Yosemite type, but\r\nits walls are sublime, rising to a height of from 2000 to 4000 feet\r\nabove the river. At the head of the valley the main ca\xc3\xb1on forks, as is\r\nfound to be the case in all yosemites. The formation of this one is due\r\nchiefly to the action of two great glaciers, whose fountains lay to the\r\neastward, on the flanks of Mounts Humphrey and Emerson and a cluster of\r\nnameless peaks farther south.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEAD OF ROCKY MOUNTAIN WILD SHEEP.]\r\n\r\nThe gray, boulder-chafed river was singing loudly through the valley,\r\nbut above its massy roar I heard the booming of a waterfall, which drew\r\nme eagerly on; and just as I emerged from the tangled groves and\r\nbrier-thickets at the head of the valley, the main fork of the river\r\ncame in sight, falling fresh from its glacier fountains in a snowy\r\ncascade, between granite walls 2000 feet high. The steep incline down\r\nwhich the glad waters thundered seemed to bar all farther progress. It\r\nwas not long, however, before I discovered a crooked seam in the rock,\r\nby which I was enabled to climb to the edge of a terrace that crosses\r\nthe ca\xc3\xb1on, and divides the cataract nearly in the middle. Here I sat\r\ndown to take breath and make some entries in my note-book, taking\r\nadvantage, at the same time, of my elevated position above the trees to\r\ngaze back over the valley into the heart of the noble landscape, little\r\nknowing the while what neighbors were near.\r\n\r\nAfter spending a few minutes in this way, I chanced to look across the\r\nfall, and there stood three sheep quietly observing me. Never did the\r\nsudden appearance of a mountain, or fall, or human friend more forcibly\r\nseize and rivet my attention. Anxiety to observe accurately held me\r\nperfectly still. Eagerly I marked the flowing undulations of their\r\nfirm, braided muscles, their strong legs, ears, eyes, heads, their\r\ngraceful rounded necks, the color of their hair, and the bold,\r\nupsweeping curves of their noble horns. When they moved I watched every\r\ngesture, while they, in no wise disconcerted either by my attention or\r\nby the tumultuous roar of the water, advanced deliberately alongside\r\nthe rapids, between the two divisions of the cataract, turning now and\r\nthen to look at me. Presently they came to a steep, ice-burnished\r\nacclivity, which they ascended by a succession of quick, short,\r\nstiff-legged leaps, reaching the top without a struggle. This was the\r\nmost startling feat of mountaineering I had ever witnessed, and,\r\nconsidering only the mechanics of the thing, my astonishment could\r\nhardly have been greater had they displayed wings and taken to flight.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurefooted\xe2\x80\x9d mules on such ground would have fallen and rolled like\r\nloosened boulders. Many a time, where the slopes are far lower, I have\r\nbeen compelled to take off my shoes and stockings, tie them to my belt,\r\nand creep barefooted, with the utmost caution. No wonder then, that I\r\nwatched the progress of these animal mountaineers with keen sympathy,\r\nand exulted in the boundless sufficiency of wild nature displayed in\r\ntheir invention, construction, and keeping. A few minutes later I\r\ncaught sight of a dozen more in one band, near the foot of the upper\r\nfall. They were standing on the same side of the river with me, only\r\ntwenty-five or thirty yards away, looking as unworn and perfect as if\r\ncreated on the spot. It appeared by their tracks, which I had seen in\r\nthe Little Yosemite, and by their present position, that when I came up\r\nthe ca\xc3\xb1on they were all feeding together down in the valley, and in\r\ntheir haste to reach high ground, where they could look about them to\r\nascertain the nature of the strange disturbance, they were divided,\r\nthree ascending on one side the river, the rest on the other.\r\n\r\nThe main band, headed by an experienced chief, now began to cross the\r\nwild rapids between the two divisions of the cascade. This was another\r\nexciting feat; for, among all the varied experiences of mountaineers,\r\nthe crossing of boisterous, rock-dashed torrents is found to be one of\r\nthe most trying to the nerves. Yet these fine fellows walked fearlessly\r\nto the brink, and jumped from boulder to boulder, holding themselves in\r\neasy poise above the whirling, confusing current, as if they were doing\r\nnothing extraordinary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSSING A CA\xc3\x91ON STREAM.]\r\n\r\nIn the immediate foreground of this rare picture there was a fold of\r\nice-burnished granite, traversed by a few bold lines in which\r\nrock-ferns and tufts of bryanthus were growing, the gray ca\xc3\xb1on walls on\r\nthe sides, nobly sculptured and adorned with brown cedars and pines;\r\nlofty peaks in the distance, and in the middle ground the snowy fall,\r\nthe voice and soul of the landscape; fringing bushes beating time to\r\nits thunder-tones, the brave sheep in front of it, their gray forms\r\nslightly obscured in the spray, yet standing out in good, heavy relief\r\nagainst the close white water, with their huge horns rising like the\r\nupturned roots of dead pine-trees, while the evening sunbeams streaming\r\nup the ca\xc3\xb1on colored all the picture a rosy purple and made it\r\nglorious. After crossing the river, the dauntless climbers, led by\r\ntheir chief, at once began to scale the ca\xc3\xb1on wall, turning now right,\r\nnow left, in long, single file, keeping well apart out of one another\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nway, and leaping in regular succession from crag to crag, now ascending\r\nslippery dome-curves, now walking leisurely along the edges of\r\nprecipices, stopping at times to gaze down at me from some flat-topped\r\nrock, with heads held aslant, as if curious to learn what I thought\r\nabout it, or whether I was likely to follow them. After reaching the\r\ntop of the wall, which, at this place, is somewhere between 1500 and\r\n2000 feet high, they were still visible against the sky as they\r\nlingered, looking down in groups of twos or threes.\r\n\r\nThroughout the entire ascent they did not make a single awkward step,\r\nor an unsuccessful effort of any kind. I have frequently seen tame\r\nsheep in mountains jump upon a sloping rock-surface, hold on\r\ntremulously a few seconds, and fall back baffled and irresolute. But in\r\nthe most trying situations, where the slightest want or inaccuracy\r\nwould have been fatal, these always seemed to move in comfortable\r\nreliance on their strength and skill, the limits of which they never\r\nappeared to know. Moreover, each one of the flock, while following the\r\nguidance of the most experienced, yet climbed with intelligent\r\nindependence as a perfect individual, capable of separate existence\r\nwhenever it should wish or be compelled to withdraw from the little\r\nclan. The domestic sheep, on the contrary, is only a fraction of an\r\nanimal, a whole flock being required to form an individual, just as\r\nnumerous flowerets are required to make one complete sunflower.\r\n\r\nThose shepherds who, in summer, drive their flocks to the mountain\r\npastures, and, while watching them night and day, have seen them\r\nfrightened by bears and storms, and scattered like wind-driven chaff,\r\nwill, in some measure, be able to appreciate the self-reliance and\r\nstrength and noble individuality of Nature\xe2\x80\x99s sheep.\r\n\r\nLike the Alp-climbing ibex of Europe, our mountaineer is said to plunge\r\nheadlong down the faces of sheer precipices, and alight on his big\r\nhorns. I know only two hunters who claim to have actually witnessed\r\nthis feat; I never was so fortunate. They describe the act as a diving\r\nhead-foremost. The horns are so large at the base that they cover the\r\nupper portion of the head down nearly to a level with the eyes, and the\r\nskull is exceedingly strong. I struck an old, bleached specimen on\r\nMount Ritter a dozen blows with my ice-ax without breaking it. Such\r\nskulls would not fracture very readily by the wildest rock-diving, but\r\nother bones could hardly be expected to hold together in such a\r\nperformance; and the mechanical difficulties in the way of controlling\r\ntheir movements, after striking upon an irregular surface, are, in\r\nthemselves, sufficient to show this boulder-like method of progression\r\nto be impossible, even in the absence of all other evidence on the\r\nsubject; moreover, the ewes follow wherever the rams may lead, although\r\ntheir horns are mere spikes. I have found many pairs of the horns of\r\nthe old rams considerably battered, doubtless a result of fighting. I\r\nwas particularly interested in the question, after witnessing the\r\nperformances of this San Joaquin band upon the glaciated rocks at the\r\nfoot of the falls; and as soon as I procured specimens and examined\r\ntheir feet, all the mystery disappeared. The secret, considered in\r\nconnection with exceptionally strong muscles, is simply this: the wide\r\nposterior portion of the bottom of the foot, instead of wearing down\r\nand becoming flat and hard, like the feet of tame sheep and horses,\r\nbulges out in a soft, rubber-like pad or cushion, which not only grips\r\nand holds well on smooth rocks, but fits into small cavities, and down\r\nupon or against slight protuberances. Even the hardest portions of the\r\nedge of the hoof are comparatively soft and elastic; furthermore, the\r\ntoes admit of an extraordinary amount of both lateral and vertical\r\nmovement, allowing the foot to accommodate itself still more perfectly\r\nto the irregularities of rock surfaces, while at the same time\r\nincreasing the gripping power.\r\n\r\nAt the base of Sheep Rock, one of the winter strongholds of the Shasta\r\nflocks, there lives a stock-raiser who has had the advantage of\r\nobserving the movements of wild sheep every winter; and, in the course\r\nof a conversation with him on the subject of their diving habits, he\r\npointed to the front of a lava headland about 150 feet high, which is\r\nonly eight or ten degrees out of the perpendicular. \xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI followed a band of them fellows to the back of that rock yonder, and\r\nexpected to capture them all, for I thought I had a dead thing on them.\r\nI got behind them on a narrow bench that runs along the face of the\r\nwall near the top and comes to an end where they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get away\r\nwithout falling and being killed; but they jumped off, and landed all\r\nright, as if that were the regular thing with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cjumped 150 feet perpendicular! Did you see them do\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t see them going down, for I was behind them;\r\nbut I saw them go off over the brink, and then I went below and found\r\ntheir tracks where they struck on the loose rubbish at the bottom. They\r\njust _sailed right off_, and landed on their feet right side up. That\r\nis the kind of animal _they_ is\xe2\x80\x94beats anything else that goes on four\r\nlegs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILD SHEEP JUMPING OVER A PRECIPICE.]\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, a flock that was pursued by hunters retreated to\r\nanother portion of this same cliff where it is still higher, and, on\r\nbeing followed, they were seen jumping down in perfect order, one\r\nbehind another, by two men who happened to be chopping where they had a\r\nfair view of them and could watch their progress from top to bottom of\r\nthe precipice. Both ewes and rams made the frightful descent without\r\nevincing any extraordinary concern, hugging the rock closely, and\r\ncontrolling the velocity of their half falling, half leaping movements\r\nby striking at short intervals and holding back with their cushioned,\r\nrubber feet upon small ledges and roughened inclines until near the\r\nbottom, when they \xe2\x80\x9csailed off\xe2\x80\x9d into the free air and alighted on their\r\nfeet, but with their bodies so nearly in a vertical position that they\r\nappeared to be diving.\r\n\r\nIt appears, therefore, that the methods of this wild mountaineering\r\nbecome clearly comprehensible as soon as we make ourselves acquainted\r\nwith the rocks, and the kind of feet and muscles brought to bear upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe Modoc and Pah Ute Indians are, or rather have been, the most\r\nsuccessful hunters of the wild sheep in the regions that have come\r\nunder my own observation. I have seen large numbers of heads and horns\r\nin the caves of Mount Shasta and the Modoc lava-beds, where the Indians\r\nhad been feasting in stormy weather; also in the ca\xc3\xb1ons of the Sierra\r\nopposite Owen\xe2\x80\x99s Valley; while the heavy obsidian arrow-heads found on\r\nsome of the highest peaks show that this warfare has long been going\r\non.\r\n\r\nIn the more accessible ranges that stretch across the desert regions of\r\nwestern Utah and Nevada, considerable numbers of Indians used to hunt\r\nin company like packs of wolves, and being perfectly acquainted with\r\nthe topography of their hunting-grounds, and with the habits and\r\ninstincts of the game, they were pretty successful. On the tops of\r\nnearly every one of the Nevada mountains that I have visited, I found\r\nsmall, nest-like inclosures built of stones, in which, as I afterward\r\nlearned, one or more Indians would lie in wait while their companions\r\nscoured the ridges below, knowing that the alarmed sheep would surely\r\nrun to the summit, and when they could be made to approach with the\r\nwind they were shot at short range.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIANS HUNTING WILD SHEEP.]\r\n\r\nStill larger bands of Indians used to make extensive hunts upon some\r\ndominant mountain much frequented by the sheep, such as Mount Grant on\r\nthe Wassuck Range to the west of Walker Lake. On some particular spot,\r\nfavorably situated with reference to the well-known trails of the\r\nsheep, they built a high-walled corral, with long guiding wings\r\ndiverging from the gateway; and into this inclosure they sometimes\r\nsucceeded in driving the noble game. Great numbers of Indians were of\r\ncourse required, more, indeed, than they could usually muster, counting\r\nin squaws, children, and all; they were compelled, therefore, to build\r\nrows of dummy hunters out of stones, along the ridge-tops which they\r\nwished to prevent the sheep from crossing. And, without discrediting\r\nthe sagacity of the game, these dummies were found effective; for, with\r\na few live Indians moving about excitedly among them, they could hardly\r\nbe distinguished at a little distance from men, by any one not in the\r\nsecret. The whole ridge-top then seemed to be alive with hunters.\r\n\r\nThe only animal that may fairly be regarded as a companion or rival of\r\nthe sheep is the so-called Rocky Mountain goat (_Aplocerus montana_,\r\nRich.), which, as its name indicates, is more antelope than goat. He,\r\ntoo, is a brave and hardy climber, fearlessly crossing the wildest\r\nsummits, and braving the severest storms, but he is shaggy,\r\nshort-legged, and much less dignified in demeanor than the sheep. His\r\njet-black horns are only about five or six inches in length, and the\r\nlong, white hair with which he is covered obscures the expression of\r\nhis limbs. I have never yet seen a single specimen in the Sierra,\r\nthough possibly a few flocks may have lived on Mount Shasta a\r\ncomparatively short time ago.\r\n\r\nThe ranges of these two mountaineers are pretty distinct, and they see\r\nbut little of each other; the sheep being restricted mostly to the dry,\r\ninland mountains; the goat or chamois to the wet, snowy glacier-laden\r\nmountains of the northwest coast of the continent in Oregon,\r\nWashington, British Columbia, and Alaska. Probably more than 200 dwell\r\non the icy, volcanic cone of Mount Rainier; and while I was exploring\r\nthe glaciers of Alaska I saw flocks of these admirable mountaineers\r\nnearly every day, and often followed their trails through the mazes of\r\nbewildering crevasses, in which they are excellent guides.\r\n\r\nThree species of deer are found in California,\xe2\x80\x94the black-tailed,\r\nwhite-tailed, and mule deer. The first mentioned (_Cervus Columbianus_)\r\nis by far the most abundant, and occasionally meets the sheep during\r\nthe summer on high glacier meadows, and along the edge of the timber\r\nline; but being a forest animal, seeking shelter and rearing its young\r\nin dense thickets, it seldom visits the wild sheep in its higher homes.\r\nThe antelope, though not a mountaineer, is occasionally met in winter\r\nby the sheep while feeding along the edges of the sage-plains and bare\r\nvolcanic hills to the east of the Sierra. So also is the mule deer,\r\nwhich is almost restricted in its range to this eastern region. The\r\nwhite-tailed species belongs to the coast ranges.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no wild animal in the world is without enemies, but\r\nhighlanders, as a class, have fewer than lowlanders. The wily panther,\r\nslipping and crouching among long grass and bushes, pounces upon the\r\nantelope and deer, but seldom crosses the bald, craggy thresholds of\r\nthe sheep. Neither can the bears be regarded as enemies; for, though\r\nthey seek to vary their every-day diet of nuts and berries by an\r\noccasional meal of mutton, they prefer to hunt tame and helpless\r\nflocks. Eagles and coyotes, no doubt, capture an unprotected lamb at\r\ntimes, or some unfortunate beset in deep, soft snow, but these cases\r\nare little more than accidents. So, also, a few perish in\r\nlong-continued snow-storms, though, in all my mountaineering, I have\r\nnot found more than five or six that seemed to have met their fate in\r\nthis way. A little band of three were discovered snow-bound in Bloody\r\nCanon a few years ago, and were killed with an ax by mountaineers, who\r\nchanced to be crossing the range in winter.\r\n\r\nMan is the most dangerous enemy of all, but even from him our brave\r\nmountain-dweller has little to fear in the remote solitudes of the High\r\nSierra. The golden plains of the Sacramento and San Joaquin were lately\r\nthronged with bands of elk and antelope, but, being fertile and\r\naccessible, they were required for human pastures. So, also, are many\r\nof the feeding-grounds of the deer\xe2\x80\x94hill, valley, forest, and meadow\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nit will be long before man will care to take the highland castles of\r\nthe sheep. And when we consider here how rapidly entire species of\r\nnoble animals, such as the elk, moose, and buffalo, are being pushed to\r\nthe very verge of extinction, all lovers of wildness will rejoice with\r\nme in the rocky security of _Ovis montana_, the bravest of all the\r\nSierra mountaineers.\r\n\r\n [1] Pacific Railroad Survey, Vol. VIII, page 678.\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] Audubon and Bachman\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cQuadrupeds of North America.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\nIN THE SIERRA FOOT-HILLS\r\n\r\n\r\nMurphy\xe2\x80\x99s camp is a curious old mining-town in Calaveras County, at an\r\nelevation of 2400 feet above the sea, situated like a nest in the\r\ncenter of a rough, gravelly region, rich in gold. Granites, slates,\r\nlavas, limestone, iron ores, quartz veins, auriferous gravels, remnants\r\nof dead fire-rivers and dead water-rivers are developed here side by\r\nside within a radius of a few miles, and placed invitingly open before\r\nthe student like a book, while the people and the region beyond the\r\ncamp furnish mines of study of never-failing interest and variety.\r\n\r\nWhen I discovered this curious place, I was tracing the channels of the\r\nancient pre-glacial rivers, instructive sections of which have been\r\nlaid bare here and in the adjacent regions by the miners. Rivers,\r\naccording to the poets, \xe2\x80\x9cgo on forever\xe2\x80\x9d; but those of the Sierra are\r\nyoung as yet and have scarcely learned the way down to the sea; while\r\nat least one generation of them have died and vanished together with\r\nmost of the basins they drained. All that remains of them to tell their\r\nhistory is a series of interrupted fragments of channels, mostly choked\r\nwith gravel, and buried beneath broad, thick sheets of lava. These are\r\nknown as the \xe2\x80\x9cDead Rivers of California,\xe2\x80\x9d and the gravel deposited in\r\nthem is comprehensively called the \xe2\x80\x9cBlue Lead.\xe2\x80\x9d In some places the\r\nchannels of the present rivers trend in the same direction, or nearly\r\nso, as those of the ancient rivers; but, in general, there is little\r\ncorrespondence between them, the entire drainage having been changed,\r\nor, rather, made new. Many of the hills of the ancient landscapes have\r\nbecome hollows, and the old hollows have become hills. Therefore the\r\nfragmentary channels, with their loads of auriferous gravel, occur in\r\nall kinds of unthought-of places, trending obliquely, or even at right\r\nangles to the present drainage, across the tops of lofty ridges or far\r\nbeneath them, presenting impressive illustrations of the magnitude of\r\nthe changes accomplished since those ancient streams were annihilated.\r\nThe last volcanic period preceding the regeneration of the Sierra\r\nlandscapes seems to have come on over all the range almost\r\nsimultaneously, like the glacial period, notwithstanding lavas of\r\ndifferent age occur together in many places, indicating numerous\r\nperiods of activity in the Sierra fire-fountains. The most important of\r\nthe ancient river-channels in this region is a section that extends\r\nfrom the south side of the town beneath Coyote Creek and the ridge\r\nbeyond it to the Ca\xc3\xb1on of the Stanislaus; but on account of its depth\r\nbelow the general surface of the present valleys the rich gold gravels\r\nit is known to contain cannot be easily worked on a large scale. Their\r\nextraordinary richness may be inferred from the fact that many claims\r\nwere profitably worked in them by sinking shafts to a depth of 200 feet\r\nor more, and hoisting the dirt by a windlass. Should the dip of this\r\nancient channel be such as to make the Stanislaus Ca\xc3\xb1on available as a\r\ndump, then the grand deposit might be worked by the hydraulic method,\r\nand although a long, expensive tunnel would be required, the scheme\r\nmight still prove profitable, for there is \xe2\x80\x9cmillions in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe importance of these ancient gravels as gold fountains is well known\r\nto miners. Even the superficial placers of the present streams have\r\nderived much of their gold from them. According to all accounts, the\r\nMurphy placers have been very rich\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cterrific rich,\xe2\x80\x9d as they say here.\r\nThe hills have been cut and scalped, and every gorge and gulch and\r\nvalley torn to pieces and disemboweled, expressing a fierce and\r\ndesperate energy hard to understand. Still, any kind of effort-making\r\nis better than inaction, and there is something sublime in seeing men\r\nworking in dead earnest at anything, pursuing an object with\r\nglacier-like energy and persistence. Many a brave fellow has recorded a\r\nmost eventful chapter of life on these Calaveras rocks. But most of the\r\npioneer miners are sleeping now, their wild day done, while the few\r\nsurvivors linger languidly in the washed-out gulches or sleepy village\r\nlike harried bees around the ruins of their hive. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have no industry\r\nleft _now_,\xe2\x80\x9d they told me, \xe2\x80\x9cand no men; everybody and everything\r\nhereabouts has gone to decay. We are only bummers\xe2\x80\x94out of the game, a\r\nthin scatterin\xe2\x80\x99 of poor, dilapidated cusses, compared with what we used\r\nto be in the grand old gold-days. We were giants then, and you can look\r\naround here and see our tracks.\xe2\x80\x9d But although these lingering pioneers\r\nare perhaps more exhausted than the mines, and about as dead as the\r\ndead rivers, they are yet a rare and interesting set of men, with much\r\ngold mixed with the rough, rocky gravel of their characters; and they\r\nmanifest a breeding and intelligence little looked for in such\r\nsurroundings as theirs. As the heavy, long-continued grinding of the\r\nglaciers brought out the features of the Sierra, so the intense\r\nexperiences of the gold period have brought out the features of these\r\nold miners, forming a richness and variety of character little known as\r\nyet. The sketches of Bret Harte, Hayes, and Miller have not exhausted\r\nthis field by any means. It is interesting to note the extremes\r\npossible in one and the same character: harshness and gentleness,\r\nmanliness and childishness, apathy and fierce endeavor. Men who, twenty\r\nyears ago, would not cease their shoveling to save their lives, now\r\nplay in the streets with children. Their long, Micawber-like waiting\r\nafter the exhaustion of the placers has brought on an exaggerated form\r\nof dotage. I heard a group of brawny pioneers in the street eagerly\r\ndiscussing the quantity of tail required for a boy\xe2\x80\x99s kite; and one\r\ngraybeard undertook the sport of flying it, volunteering the\r\ninformation that he was a boy, \xe2\x80\x9calways was a boy, and d\xe2\x80\x94n a man who was\r\nnot a boy inside, however ancient outside!\xe2\x80\x9d Mines, morals, politics,\r\nthe immortality of the soul, etc., were discussed beneath shade-trees\r\nand in saloons, the time for each being governed apparently by the\r\ntemperature. Contact with Nature, and the habits of observation\r\nacquired in gold-seeking, had made them all, to some extent,\r\ncollectors, and, like wood-rats, they had gathered all kinds of odd\r\nspecimens into their cabins, and now required me to examine them. They\r\nwere themselves the oddest and most interesting specimens. One of them\r\noffered to show me around the old diggings, giving me fair warning\r\nbefore setting out that I might not like him, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpeople say I\xe2\x80\x99m eccentric. I notice everything, and gather beetles and\r\nsnakes and anything that\xe2\x80\x99s queer; and so some don\xe2\x80\x99t like me, and call\r\nme eccentric. I\xe2\x80\x99m always trying to find out things. Now, there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nweed; the Indians eat it for greens. What do you call those long-bodied\r\nflies with big heads?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDragon-flies,\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, their jaws\r\nwork sidewise, instead of up and down, and grasshoppers\xe2\x80\x99 jaws work the\r\nsame way, and therefore I think they are the same species. I always\r\nnotice everything like that, and just because I do, they say I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\neccentric,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.\r\n\r\nAnxious that I should miss none of the wonders of their old gold-field,\r\nthe good people had much to say about the marvelous beauty of Cave City\r\nCave, and advised me to explore it. This I was very glad to do, and\r\nfinding a guide who knew the way to the mouth of it, I set out from\r\nMurphy the next morning.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful and extensive of the mountain caves of California\r\noccur in a belt of metamorphic limestone that is pretty generally\r\ndeveloped along the western flank of the Sierra from the McCloud River\r\non the north to the Kaweah on the south, a distance of over 400 miles,\r\nat an elevation of from 2000 to 7000 feet above the sea. Besides this\r\nregular belt of caves, the California landscapes are diversified by\r\nlong imposing ranks of sea-caves, rugged and variable in architecture,\r\ncarved in the coast headlands and precipices by centuries of\r\nwave-dashing; and innumerable lava-caves, great and small, originating\r\nin the unequal flowing and hardening of the lava sheets in which they\r\noccur, fine illustrations of which are presented in the famous Modoc\r\nLava Beds, and around the base of icy Shasta. In this comprehensive\r\nglance we may also notice the shallow wind-worn caves in stratified\r\nsandstones along the margins of the plains; and the cave-like recesses\r\nin the Sierra slates and granites, where bears and other mountaineers\r\nfind shelter during the fall of sudden storms. In general, however, the\r\ngrand massive uplift of the Sierra, as far as it has been laid-bare to\r\nobservation, is about as solid and caveless as a boulder.\r\n\r\nFresh beauty opens one\xe2\x80\x99s eyes wherever it is really seen, but the very\r\nabundance and completeness of the common beauty that besets our steps\r\nprevents its being absorbed and appreciated. It is a good thing,\r\ntherefore, to make short excursions now and then to the bottom of the\r\nsea among dulse and coral, or up among the clouds on mountain-tops, or\r\nin balloons, or even to creep like worms into dark holes and caverns\r\nunderground, not only to learn something of what is going on in those\r\nout-of-the-way places, but to see better what the sun sees on our\r\nreturn to common every-day beauty.\r\n\r\nOur way from Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s to the cave lay across a series of picturesque,\r\nmoory ridges in the chaparral region between the brown foot-hills and\r\nthe forests, a flowery stretch of rolling hill-waves breaking here and\r\nthere into a kind of rocky foam on the higher summits, and sinking into\r\ndelightful bosky hollows embowered with vines. The day was a fine\r\nspecimen of California summer, pure sunshine, unshaded most of the time\r\nby a single cloud. As the sun rose higher, the heated air began to flow\r\nin tremulous waves from every southern slope. The sea-breeze that\r\nusually comes up the foot-hills at this season, with cooling on its\r\nwings, was scarcely perceptible. The birds were assembled beneath leafy\r\nshade, or made short, languid flights in search of food, all save the\r\nmajestic buzzard; with broad wings outspread he sailed the warm air\r\nunwearily from ridge to ridge, seeming to enjoy the fervid sunshine\r\nlike a butterfly. Squirrels, too, whose spicy ardor no heat or cold may\r\nabate, were nutting among the pines, and the innumerable hosts of the\r\ninsect kingdom were throbbing and wavering unwearied as sunbeams.\r\n\r\nThis brushy, berry-bearing region used to be a deer and bear pasture,\r\nbut since the disturbances of the gold period these fine animals have\r\nalmost wholly disappeared. Here, also, once roamed the mastodon and\r\nelephant, whose bones are found entombed in the river gravels and\r\nbeneath thick folds of lava. Toward noon, as we were riding slowly over\r\nbank and brae, basking in the unfeverish sun-heat, we witnessed the\r\nupheaval of a new mountain-range, a Sierra of clouds abounding in\r\nlandscapes as truly sublime and beautiful\xe2\x80\x94if only we have a mind to\r\nthink so and eyes to see\xe2\x80\x94as the more ancient rocky Sierra beneath it,\r\nwith its forests and waterfalls; reminding us that, as there is a lower\r\nworld of caves, so, also, there is an upper world of clouds. Huge,\r\nbossy cumuli developed with astonishing rapidity from mere buds,\r\nswelling with visible motion into colossal mountains, and piling\r\nhigher, higher, in long massive ranges, peak beyond peak, dome over\r\ndome, with many a picturesque valley and shadowy cave between; while\r\nthe dark firs and pines of the upper benches of the Sierra were\r\nprojected against their pearl bosses with exquisite clearness of\r\noutline. These cloud mountains vanished in the azure as quickly as they\r\nwere developed, leaving no detritus; but they were not a whit less real\r\nor interesting on this account. The more enduring hills over which we\r\nrode were vanishing as surely as they, only not so fast, a difference\r\nwhich is great or small according to the standpoint from which it is\r\ncontemplated.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of every dell we found little homesteads embosomed in\r\nwild brush and vines wherever the recession of the hills left patches\r\nof arable ground. These secluded flats are settled mostly by Italians\r\nand Germans, who plant a few vegetables and grape-vines at odd times,\r\nwhile their main business is mining and prospecting. In spite of all\r\nthe natural beauty of these dell cabins, they can hardly be called\r\nhomes. They are only a better kind of camp, gladly abandoned whenever\r\nthe hoped-for gold harvest has been gathered. There is an air of\r\nprofound unrest and melancholy about the best of them. Their beauty is\r\nthrust upon them by exuberant Nature, apart from which they are only a\r\nfew logs and boards rudely jointed and without either ceiling or floor,\r\na rough fireplace with corresponding cooking utensils, a shelf-bed, and\r\nstool. The ground about them is strewn with battered prospecting-pans,\r\npicks, sluice-boxes, and quartz specimens from many a ledge, indicating\r\nthe trend of their owners\xe2\x80\x99 hard lives.\r\n\r\nThe ride from Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s to the cave is scarcely two hours long, but we\r\nlingered among quartz-ledges and banks of dead river gravel until long\r\nafter noon. At length emerging from a narrow-throated gorge, a small\r\nhouse came in sight set in a thicket of fig-trees at the base of a\r\nlimestone hill. \xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d said my guide, pointing to the house, \xe2\x80\x9cis Cave\r\nCity, and the cave is in that gray hill.\xe2\x80\x9d Arriving at the one house of\r\nthis one-house city, we were boisterously welcomed by three drunken men\r\nwho had come to town to hold a spree. The mistress of the house tried\r\nto keep order, and in reply to our inquiries told us that the cave\r\nguide was then in the cave with a party of ladies. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd must we wait\r\nuntil he returns?\xe2\x80\x9d we asked. No, that was unnecessary; we might take\r\ncandles and go into the cave alone, provided we shouted from time to\r\ntime so as to be found by the guide, and were careful not to fall over\r\nthe rocks or into the dark pools. Accordingly taking a trail from the\r\nhouse, we were led around the base of the hill to the mouth of the\r\ncave, a small inconspicuous archway, mossy around the edges and shaped\r\nlike the door of a water-ouzel\xe2\x80\x99s nest, with no appreciable hint or\r\nadvertisement of the grandeur of the many crystal chambers within.\r\nLighting our candles, which seemed to have no illuminating power in the\r\nthick darkness, we groped our way onward as best we could along narrow\r\nlanes and alleys, from chamber to chamber, around rustic columns and\r\nheaps of fallen rocks, stopping to rest now and then in particularly\r\nbeautiful places\xe2\x80\x94fairy alcoves furnished with admirable variety of\r\nshelves and tables, and round bossy stools covered with sparkling\r\ncrystals. Some of the corridors were muddy, and in plodding along these\r\nwe seemed to be in the streets of some prairie village in spring-time.\r\nThen we would come to handsome marble stairways conducting right and\r\nleft into upper chambers ranged above one another three or four stories\r\nhigh, floors, ceilings, and walls lavishly decorated with innumerable\r\ncrystalline forms. After thus wandering exploringly, and alone for a\r\nmile or so, fairly enchanted, a murmur of voices and a gleam of light\r\nbetrayed the approach of the guide and his party, from whom, when they\r\ncame up, we received a most hearty and natural stare, as we stood half\r\nconcealed in a side recess among stalagmites. I ventured to ask the\r\ndripping, crouching company how they had enjoyed their saunter, anxious\r\nto learn how the strange sunless scenery of the underworld had\r\nimpressed them. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice! It\xe2\x80\x99s splendid!\xe2\x80\x9d they all replied and\r\nechoed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bridal Chamber back here is just glorious! This morning we\r\ncame down from the Calaveras Big Tree Grove, and the trees are nothing\r\nto it.\xe2\x80\x9d After making this curious comparison they hastened sunward, the\r\nguide promising to join us shortly on the bank of a deep pool, where we\r\nwere to wait for him. This is a charming little lakelet of unknown\r\ndepth, never yet stirred by a breeze, and its eternal calm excites the\r\nimagination even more profoundly than the silvery lakes of the glaciers\r\nrimmed with meadows and snow and reflecting sublime mountains.\r\n\r\nOur guide, a jolly, rollicking Italian, led us into the heart of the\r\nhill, up and down, right and left, from chamber to chamber more and\r\nmore magnificent, all a-glitter like a glacier cave with icicle-like\r\nstalactites and stalagmites combined in forms of indescribable beauty.\r\nWe were shown one large room that was occasionally used as a\r\ndancing-hall; another that was used as a chapel, with natural pulpit\r\nand crosses and pews, sermons in every stone, where a priest had said\r\nmass. Mass-saying is not so generally developed in connection with\r\nnatural wonders as dancing. One of the first conceits excited by the\r\ngiant Sequoias was to cut one of them down and dance on its stump. We\r\nhave also seen dancing in the spray of Niagara; dancing in the famous\r\nBower Cave above Coulterville; and nowhere have I seen so much dancing\r\nas in Yosemite. A dance on the inaccessible South Dome would likely\r\nfollow the making of an easy way to the top of it.\r\n\r\nIt was delightful to witness here the infinite deliberation of Nature,\r\nand the simplicity of her methods in the production of such mighty\r\nresults, such perfect repose combined with restless enthusiastic\r\nenergy. Though cold and bloodless as a landscape of polar ice, building\r\nwas going on in the dark with incessant activity. The archways and\r\nceilings were everywhere hung with down-growing crystals, like inverted\r\ngroves of leafless saplings, some of them large, others delicately\r\nattenuated, each tipped with a single drop of water, like the terminal\r\nbud of a pine-tree. The only appreciable sounds were the dripping and\r\ntinkling of water failing into pools or faintly plashing on the crystal\r\nfloors.\r\n\r\nIn some places the crystal decorations are arranged in graceful flowing\r\nfolds deeply plicated like stiff silken drapery. In others straight\r\nlines of the ordinary stalactite forms are combined with reference to\r\nsize and tone in a regularly graduated system like the strings of a\r\nharp with musical tones corresponding thereto; and on these stone harps\r\nwe played by striking the crystal strings with a stick. The delicious\r\nliquid tones they gave forth seemed perfectly divine as they sweetly\r\nwhispered and wavered through the majestic halls and died away in\r\nfaintest cadence,\xe2\x80\x94the music of fairy-land. Here we lingered and\r\nreveled, rejoicing to find so much music in stony silence, so much\r\nsplendor in darkness, so many mansions in the depths of the mountains,\r\nbuildings ever in process of construction, yet ever finished,\r\ndeveloping from perfection to perfection, profusion without\r\noverabundance; every particle visible or invisible in glorious motion,\r\nmarching to the music of the spheres in a region regarded as the abode\r\nof eternal stillness and death.\r\n\r\nThe outer chambers of mountain caves are frequently selected as homes\r\nby wild beasts. In the Sierra, however, they seem to prefer homes and\r\nhiding-places in chaparral and beneath shelving precipices, as I have\r\nnever seen their tracks in any of the caves. This is the more\r\nremarkable because notwithstanding the darkness and oozing water there\r\nis nothing uncomfortably cellar-like or sepulchral about them.\r\n\r\nWhen we emerged into the bright landscapes of the sun everything looked\r\nbrighter, and we felt our faith in Nature\xe2\x80\x99s beauty strengthened, and\r\nsaw more clearly that beauty is universal and immortal, above, beneath,\r\non land and sea, mountain and plain, in heat and cold, light and\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\nTHE BEE-PASTURES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen California was wild, it was one sweet bee-garden throughout its\r\nentire length, north and south, and all the way across from the snowy\r\nSierra to the ocean.\r\n\r\nWherever a bee might fly within the bounds of this virgin\r\nwilderness\xe2\x80\x94through the redwood forests, along the banks of the rivers,\r\nalong the bluffs and headlands fronting the sea, over valley and plain,\r\npark and grove, and deep, leafy glen, or far up the piny slopes of the\r\nmountains\xe2\x80\x94throughout every belt and section of climate up to the timber\r\nline, bee-flowers bloomed in lavish, abundance. Here they grew more or\r\nless apart in special sheets and patches of no great size, there in\r\nbroad, flowing folds hundreds of miles in length\xe2\x80\x94zones of polleny\r\nforests, zones of flowery chaparral, stream-tangles of rubus and wild\r\nrose, sheets of golden composite, beds of violets, beds of mint, beds\r\nof bryanthus and clover, and so on, certain species blooming somewhere\r\nall the year round.\r\n\r\nBut of late years plows and sheep have made sad havoc in these glorious\r\npastures, destroying tens of thousands of the flowery acres like a\r\nfire, and banishing many species of the best honey-plants to rocky\r\ncliffs and fence-corners, while, on the other hand, cultivation thus\r\nfar has given no adequate compensation, at least in kind; only acres of\r\nalfalfa for miles of the richest wild pasture, ornamental roses and\r\nhoneysuckles around cottage doors for cascades of wild roses in the\r\ndells, and small, square orchards and orange-groves for broad\r\nmountain-belts of chaparral.\r\n\r\nThe Great Central Plain of California, during the months of March,\r\nApril, and May, was one smooth, continuous bed of honey-bloom, so\r\nmarvelously rich that, in walking from one end of it to the other, a\r\ndistance of more than 400 miles, your foot would press about a hundred\r\nflowers at every step. Mints, gilias, nemophilas, castilleias, and\r\ninnumerable compositae were so crowded together that, had ninety-nine\r\nper cent. of them been taken away, the plain would still have seemed to\r\nany but Californians extravagantly flowery. The radiant, honeyful\r\ncorollas, touching and overlapping, and rising above one another,\r\nglowed in the living light like a sunset sky\xe2\x80\x94one sheet of purple and\r\ngold, with the bright Sacramento pouring through the midst of it from\r\nthe north, the San Joaquin from the south, and their many tributaries\r\nsweeping in at right angles from the mountains, dividing the plain into\r\nsections fringed with trees.\r\n\r\nAlong the rivers there is a strip of bottom-land, countersunk beneath\r\nthe general level, and wider toward the foot-hills, where magnificent\r\noaks, from three to eight feet in diameter, cast grateful masses of\r\nshade over the open, prairie-like levels. And close along the water\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nedge there was a fine jungle of tropical luxuriance, composed of\r\nwild-rose and bramble bushes and a great variety of climbing vines,\r\nwreathing and interlacing the branches and trunks of willows and\r\nalders, and swinging across from summit to summit in heavy festoons.\r\nHere the wild bees reveled in fresh bloom long after the flowers of the\r\ndrier plain had withered and gone to seed. And in midsummer, when the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cblackberries\xe2\x80\x9d were ripe, the Indians came from the mountains to\r\nfeast\xe2\x80\x94men, women, and babies in long, noisy trains, often joined by the\r\nfarmers of the neighborhood, who gathered this wild fruit with\r\ncommendable appreciation of its superior flavor, while their home\r\norchards were full of ripe peaches, apricots, nectarines, and figs, and\r\ntheir vineyards were laden with grapes. But, though these luxuriant,\r\nshaggy river-beds were thus distinct from the smooth, treeless plain,\r\nthey made no heavy dividing lines in general views. The whole appeared\r\nas one continuous sheet of bloom bounded only by the mountains.\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw this central garden, the most extensive and regular of\r\nall the bee-pastures of the State, it seemed all one sheet of plant\r\ngold, hazy and vanishing in the distance, distinct as a new map along\r\nthe foot-hills at my feet.\r\n\r\nDescending the eastern slopes of the Coast Range through beds of gilias\r\nand lupines, and around many a breezy hillock and bush-crowned\r\nheadland, I at length waded out into the midst of it. All the ground\r\nwas covered, not with grass and green leaves, but with radiant\r\ncorollas, about ankle-deep next the foot-hills, knee-deep or more five\r\nor six miles out. Here were bahia, madia, madaria, burrielia,\r\nchrysopsis, corethrogyne, grindelia, etc., growing in close social\r\ncongregations of various shades of yellow, blending finely with the\r\npurples of clarkia, orthocarpus, and oenothera, whose delicate petals\r\nwere drinking the vital sunbeams without giving back any sparkling\r\nglow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BEE-RANCH IN LOWER CALIFORNIA.]\r\n\r\nBecause so long a period of extreme drought succeeds the rainy season,\r\nmost of the vegetation is composed of annuals, which spring up\r\nsimultaneously, and bloom together at about the same height above the\r\nground, the general surface being but slightly ruffled by the taller\r\nphacelias, pentstemons, and groups of _Salvia carduacea_, the king of\r\nthe mints.\r\n\r\nSauntering in any direction, hundreds of these happy sun-plants brushed\r\nagainst my feet at every step, and closed over them as if I were wading\r\nin liquid gold. The air was sweet with fragrance, the larks sang their\r\nblessed songs, rising on the wing as I advanced, then sinking out of\r\nsight in the polleny sod, while myriads of wild bees stirred the lower\r\nair with their monotonous hum\xe2\x80\x94monotonous, yet forever fresh and sweet\r\nas every-day sunshine. Hares and spermophiles showed themselves in\r\nconsiderable numbers in shallow places, and small bands of antelopes\r\nwere almost constantly in sight, gazing curiously from some slight\r\nelevation, and then bounding swiftly away with unrivaled grace of\r\nmotion. Yet I could discover no crushed flowers to mark their track,\r\nnor, indeed, any destructive action of any wild foot or tooth whatever.\r\n\r\nThe great yellow days circled by uncounted, while I drifted toward the\r\nnorth, observing the countless forms of life thronging about me, lying\r\ndown almost anywhere on the approach of night. And what glorious\r\nbotanical beds I had! Oftentimes on awaking I would find several new\r\nspecies leaning over me and looking me full in the face, so that my\r\nstudies would begin before rising.\r\n\r\nAbout the first of May I turned eastward, crossing the San Joaquin\r\nRiver between the mouths of the Tuolumne and Merced, and by the time I\r\nhad reached the Sierra foot-hills most of the vegetation had gone to\r\nseed and become as dry as hay.\r\n\r\nAll the seasons of the great plain are warm or temperate, and\r\nbee-flowers are never wholly wanting; but the grand springtime\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nannual resurrection\xe2\x80\x94is governed by the rains, which usually set in\r\nabout the middle of November or the beginning of December. Then the\r\nseeds, that for six months have lain on the ground dry and fresh as if\r\nthey had been gathered into barns, at once unfold their treasured life.\r\nThe general brown and purple of the ground, and the dead vegetation of\r\nthe preceding year, give place to the green of mosses and liverworts\r\nand myriads of young leaves. Then one species after another comes into\r\nflower, gradually overspreading the green with yellow and purple, which\r\nlasts until May.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9crainy season\xe2\x80\x9d is by no means a gloomy, soggy period of constant\r\ncloudiness and rain. Perhaps nowhere else in North America, perhaps in\r\nthe world, are the months of December, January, February, and March so\r\nfull of bland, plant-building sunshine. Referring to my notes of the\r\nwinter and spring of 1868-69, every day of which I spent out of doors,\r\non that section of the plain lying between the Tuolumne and Merced\r\nrivers, I find that the first rain of the season fell on December 18th.\r\nJanuary had only six rainy days\xe2\x80\x94that is, days on which rain fell;\r\nFebruary three, March five, April three, and May three, completing the\r\nso-called rainy season, which was about an average one. The ordinary\r\nrain-storm of this region is seldom very cold or violent. The winds,\r\nwhich in settled weather come from the northwest, veer round into the\r\nopposite direction, the sky fills gradually and evenly with one general\r\ncloud, from which, the rain falls steadily, often for days in\r\nsuccession, at a temperature of about 45\xc2\xb0 or 50\xc2\xb0.\r\n\r\nMore than seventy-five per cent. of all the rain of this season came\r\nfrom the northwest, down the coast over southeastern Alaska, British\r\nColumbia, Washington, and Oregon, though the local winds of these\r\ncircular storms blow from the southeast. One magnificent local storm\r\nfrom the northwest fell on March 21. A massive, round-browed cloud came\r\nswelling and thundering over the flowery plain in most imposing\r\nmajesty, its bossy front burning white and purple in the full blaze of\r\nthe sun, while warm rain poured from its ample fountains like a\r\ncataract, beating down flowers and bees, and flooding the dry\r\nwatercourses as suddenly as those of Nevada are flooded by the\r\nso-called \xe2\x80\x9ccloudbursts.\xe2\x80\x9d But in less than half an hour not a trace of\r\nthe heavy, mountain-like cloud-structure was left in the sky, and the\r\nbees were on the wing, as if nothing more gratefully refreshing could\r\nhave been sent them.\r\n\r\nBy the end of January four species of plants were in flower, and five\r\nor six mosses had already adjusted their hoods and were in the prime of\r\nlife; but the flowers were not sufficiently numerous as yet to affect\r\ngreatly the general green of the young leaves. Violets made their\r\nappearance in the first week of February, and toward the end of this\r\nmonth the warmer portions of the plain were already golden with myriads\r\nof the flowers of rayed composite.\r\n\r\nThis was the full springtime. The sunshine grew warmer and richer, new\r\nplants bloomed every day; the air became more tuneful with humming\r\nwings, and sweeter with the fragrance of the opening flowers. Ants and\r\nground squirrels were getting ready for their summer work, rubbing\r\ntheir benumbed limbs, and sunning themselves on the husk-piles before\r\ntheir doors, and spiders were busy mending their old webs, or weaving\r\nnew ones.\r\n\r\nIn March, the vegetation was more than doubled in depth and color;\r\nclaytonia, calandrinia, a large white gilia, and two nemophilas were in\r\nbloom, together with a host of yellow composite, tall enough now to\r\nbend in the wind and show wavering ripples of shade.\r\n\r\nIn April, plant-life, as a whole, reached its greatest height, and the\r\nplain, over all its varied surface, was mantled with a close, furred\r\nplush of purple and golden corollas. By the end of this month, most of\r\nthe species had ripened their seeds, but undecayed, still seemed to be\r\nin bloom from the numerous corolla-like involucres and whorls of chaffy\r\nscales of the composite. In May, the bees found in flower only a few\r\ndeep-set liliaceous plants and eriogonums.\r\n\r\nJune, July, August, and September is the season of rest and sleep,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nwinter of dry heat,\xe2\x80\x94followed in October by a second outburst of bloom\r\nat the very driest time of the year. Then, after the shrunken mass of\r\nleaves and stalks of the dead vegetation crinkle and turn to dust\r\nbeneath the foot, as if it had been baked in an oven, _Hemizonia\r\nvirgata_, a slender, unobtrusive little plant, from six inches to three\r\nfeet high, suddenly makes its appearance in patches miles in extent,\r\nlike a resurrection of the bloom of April. I have counted upward of\r\n3000 flowers, five eighths of an inch in diameter, on a single plant.\r\nBoth its leaves and stems are so slender as to be nearly invisible, at\r\na distance of a few yards, amid so showy a multitude of flowers. The\r\nray and disk flowers are both yellow, the stamens purple, and the\r\ntexture of the rays is rich and velvety, like the petals of garden\r\npansies. The prevailing wind turns all the heads round to the\r\nsoutheast, so that in facing northwestward we have the flowers looking\r\nus in the face. In my estimation, this little plant, the last born of\r\nthe brilliant host of compositae that glorify the plain, is the most\r\ninteresting of all. It remains in flower until November, uniting with\r\ntwo or three species of wiry eriogonums, which continue the floral\r\nchain around December to the spring flowers of January. Thus, although\r\nthe main bloom and honey season is only about three months long, the\r\nfloral circle, however thin around some of the hot, rainless months, is\r\nnever completely broken.\r\n\r\nHow long the various species of wild bees have lived in this\r\nhoney-garden, nobody knows; probably ever since the main body of the\r\npresent flora gained possession of the land, toward the close of the\r\nglacial period. The first brown honey-bees brought to California are\r\nsaid to have arrived in San Francisco in March, 1853. A bee-keeper by\r\nthe name of Shelton purchased a lot, consisting of twelve swarms, from\r\nsome one at Aspinwall, who had brought them from New York. When landed\r\nat San Francisco, all the hives contained live bees, but they finally\r\ndwindled to one hive, which was taken to San Jos\xc3\xa9. The little\r\nimmigrants flourished and multiplied in the bountiful pastures of the\r\nSanta Clara Valley, sending off three swarms the first season. The\r\nowner was killed shortly afterward, and in settling up his estate, two\r\nof the swarms were sold at auction for $105 and $110 respectively.\r\nOther importations were made, from time to time, by way of the Isthmus,\r\nand, though great pains were taken to insure success, about one half\r\nusually died on the way. Four swarms were brought safely across the\r\nplains in 1859, the hives being placed in the rear end of a wagon,\r\nwhich was stopped in the afternoon to allow the bees to fly and feed in\r\nthe floweriest places that were within reach until dark, when the hives\r\nwere closed.\r\n\r\nIn 1855, two years after the time of the first arrivals from New York,\r\na single swarm was brought over from San Jos\xc3\xa9, and let fly in the Great\r\nCentral Plain. Bee-culture, however, has never gained much attention\r\nhere, notwithstanding the extraordinary abundance of honey-bloom, and\r\nthe high price of honey during the early years. A few hives are found\r\nhere and there among settlers who chanced to have learned something\r\nabout the business before coming to the State. But sheep, cattle,\r\ngrain, and fruit raising are the chief industries, as they require less\r\nskill and care, while the profits thus far have been greater. In 1856\r\nhoney sold here at from one and a half to two dollars per pound. Twelve\r\nyears later the price had fallen to twelve and a half cents. In 1868 I\r\nsat down to dinner with a band of ravenous sheep-shearers at a ranch on\r\nthe San Joaquin, where fifteen or twenty hives were kept, and our host\r\nadvised us not to spare the large pan of honey he had placed on the\r\ntable, as it was the cheapest article he had to offer. In all my walks,\r\nhowever, I have never come upon a regular bee-ranch in the Central\r\nValley like those so common and so skilfully managed in the southern\r\ncounties of the State. The few pounds of honey and wax produced are\r\nconsumed at home, and are scarcely taken into account among the coarser\r\nproducts of the farm. The swarms that escape from their careless owners\r\nhave a weary, perplexing time of it in seeking suitable homes. Most of\r\nthem make their way to the foot-hills of the mountains, or to the trees\r\nthat line the banks of the rivers, where some hollow log or trunk may\r\nbe found. A friend of mine, while out hunting on the San Joaquin, came\r\nupon an old coon trap, hidden among some tall grass, near the edge of\r\nthe river, upon which he sat down to rest. Shortly afterward his\r\nattention was attracted to a crowd of angry bees that were flying\r\nexcitedly about his head, when he discovered that he was sitting upon\r\ntheir hive, which was found to contain more than 200 pounds of honey.\r\nOut in the broad, swampy delta of the Sacramento and San Joaquin\r\nrivers, the little wanderers have been known to build their combs in a\r\nbunch of rushes, or stiff, wiry grass, only slightly protected from the\r\nweather, and in danger every spring of being carried away by floods.\r\nThey have the advantage, however, of a vast extent of fresh pasture,\r\naccessible only to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe present condition of the Grand Central Garden is very different\r\nfrom that we have sketched. About twenty years ago, when the gold\r\nplacers had been pretty thoroughly exhausted, the attention of\r\nfortune-seekers\xe2\x80\x94not home-seekers\xe2\x80\x94was, in great part, turned away from\r\nthe mines to the fertile plains, and many began experiments in a kind\r\nof restless, wild agriculture. A load of lumber would be hauled to some\r\nspot on the free wilderness, where water could be easily found, and a\r\nrude box-cabin built. Then a gang-plow was procured, and a dozen\r\nmustang ponies, worth ten or fifteen dollars apiece, and with these\r\nhundreds of acres were stirred as easily as if the land had been under\r\ncultivation for years, tough, perennial roots being almost wholly\r\nabsent. Thus a ranch was established, and from these bare wooden huts,\r\nas centers of desolation, the wild flora vanished in ever-widening\r\ncircles. But the arch destroyers are the shepherds, with their flocks\r\nof hoofed locusts, sweeping over the ground like a fire, and trampling\r\ndown every rod that escapes the plow as completely as if the whole\r\nplain were a cottage garden-plot without a fence. But notwithstanding\r\nthese destroyers, a thousand swarms of bees may be pastured here for\r\nevery one now gathering honey. The greater portion is still covered\r\nevery season with a repressed growth of bee-flowers, for most of the\r\nspecies are annuals, and many of them are not relished by sheep or\r\ncattle, while the rapidity of their growth enables them to develop and\r\nmature their seeds before any foot has time to crush them. The ground\r\nis, therefore, kept sweet, and the race is perpetuated, though only as\r\na suggestive shadow of the magnificence of its wildness.\r\n\r\nThe time will undoubtedly come when the entire area of this noble\r\nvalley will be tilled like a garden, when the fertilizing waters of the\r\nmountains, now flowing to the sea, will be distributed to every acre,\r\ngiving rise to prosperous towns, wealth, arts, etc. Then, I suppose,\r\nthere will be few left, even among botanists, to deplore the vanished\r\nprimeval flora. In the mean time, the pure waste going on\xe2\x80\x94the wanton\r\ndestruction of the innocents\xe2\x80\x94is a sad sight to see, and the sun may\r\nwell be pitied in being compelled to look on.\r\n\r\nThe bee-pastures of the Coast Ranges last longer and are more varied\r\nthan those of the great plain, on account of differences of soil and\r\nclimate, moisture, and shade, etc. Some of the mountains are upward of\r\n4000 feet in height, and small streams, springs, oozy bogs, etc., occur\r\nin great abundance and variety in the wooded regions, while open parks,\r\nflooded with sunshine, and hill-girt valleys lying at different\r\nelevations, each with its own peculiar climate and exposure, possess\r\nthe required conditions for the development of species and families of\r\nplants widely varied.\r\n\r\nNext the plain there is, first, a series of smooth hills, planted with\r\na rich and showy vegetation that differs but little from that of the\r\nplain itself\xe2\x80\x94as if the edge of the plain had been lifted and bent into\r\nflowing folds, with all its flowers in place, only toned down a little\r\nas to their luxuriance, and a few new species introduced, such as the\r\nhill lupines, mints, and gilias. The colors show finely when thus held\r\nto view on the slopes; patches of red, purple, blue, yellow, and white,\r\nblending around the edges, the whole appearing at a little distance\r\nlike a map colored in sections.\r\n\r\nAbove this lies the park and chaparral region, with oaks, mostly\r\nevergreen, planted wide apart, and blooming shrubs from three to ten\r\nfeet high; manzanita and ceanothus of several species, mixed with\r\nrhamnus, cercis, pickeringia, cherry, amelanchier, and adenostoma, in\r\nshaggy, interlocking thickets, and many species of hosackia, clover,\r\nmonardella, castilleia, etc., in the openings.\r\n\r\nThe main ranges send out spurs somewhat parallel to their axes,\r\ninclosing level valleys, many of them quite extensive, and containing a\r\ngreat profusion of sun-loving bee-flowers in their wild state; but\r\nthese are, in great part, already lost to the bees by cultivation.\r\n\r\nNearer the coast are the giant forests of the redwoods, extending from\r\nnear the Oregon line to Santa Cruz. Beneath the cool, deep shade of\r\nthese majestic trees the ground is occupied by ferns, chiefly\r\nwoodwardia and aspidiums, with only a few flowering plants\xe2\x80\x94oxalis,\r\ntrientalis, erythronium, fritillaria, smilax, and other shade-lovers.\r\nBut all along the redwood belt there are sunny openings on hill-slopes\r\nlooking to the south, where the giant trees stand back, and give the\r\nground to the small sunflowers and the bees. Around the lofty redwood\r\nwalls of these little bee-acres there is usually a fringe of Chestnut\r\nOak, Laurel, and Madro\xc3\xb1o, the last of which is a surpassingly beautiful\r\ntree, and a great favorite with the bees. The trunks of the largest\r\nspecimens are seven or eight feet thick, and about fifty feet high; the\r\nbark red and chocolate colored, the leaves plain, large, and glossy,\r\nlike those of _Magnolia grandiflora_, while the flowers are\r\nyellowish-white, and urn-shaped, in well-proportioned panicles, from\r\nfive to ten inches long. When in full bloom, a single tree seems to be\r\nvisited at times by a whole hive of bees at once, and the deep hum of\r\nsuch a multitude makes the listener guess that more than the ordinary\r\nwork of honey-winning must be going on.\r\n\r\nHow perfectly enchanting and care-obliterating are these withdrawn\r\ngardens of the woods\xe2\x80\x94long vistas opening to the sea\xe2\x80\x94sunshine sifting\r\nand pouring upon the flowery ground in a tremulous, shifting mosaic, as\r\nthe light-ways in the leafy wall open and close with the swaying\r\nbreeze\xe2\x80\x94shining leaves and flowers, birds and bees, mingling together in\r\nspringtime harmony, and soothing fragrance exhaling from a thousand\r\nthousand fountains! In these balmy, dissolving days, when the deep\r\nheart-beats of Nature are felt thrilling rocks and trees and everything\r\nalike, common business and friends are happily forgotten, and even the\r\nnatural honey-work of bees, and the care of birds for their young, and\r\nmothers for their children, seem slightly out of place.\r\n\r\nTo the northward, in Humboldt and the adjacent counties, whole\r\nhillsides are covered with rhododendron, making a glorious melody of\r\nbee-bloom in the spring. And the Western azalea, hardly less flowery,\r\ngrows in massy thickets three to eight feet high around the edges of\r\ngroves and woods as far south as San Luis Obispo, usually accompanied\r\nby manzanita; while the valleys, with their varying moisture and shade,\r\nyield a rich variety of the smaller honey-flowers, such as mentha,\r\nlycopus, micromeria, audibertia, trichostema, and other mints; with\r\nvaccinium, wild strawberry, geranium, calais, and goldenrod; and in the\r\ncool glens along the stream-banks, where the shade of trees is not too\r\ndeep, spiraea, dog-wood, heteromeles, and calycanthus, and many species\r\nof rubus form interlacing tangles, some portion of which continues in\r\nbloom for months.\r\n\r\nThough the coast region was the first to be invaded and settled by\r\nwhite men, it has suffered less from a bee point of view than either of\r\nthe other main divisions, chiefly, no doubt, because of the unevenness\r\nof the surface, and because it is owned and protected instead of lying\r\nexposed to the flocks of the wandering \xe2\x80\x9csheepmen.\xe2\x80\x9d These remarks apply\r\nmore particularly to the north half of the coast. Farther south there\r\nis less moisture, less forest shade, and the honey flora is less\r\nvaried.\r\n\r\nThe Sierra region is the largest of the three main divisions of the\r\nbee-lands of the State, and the most regularly varied in its\r\nsubdivisions, owing to their gradual rise from the level of the Central\r\nPlain to the alpine summits. The foot-hill region is about as dry and\r\nsunful, from the end of May until the setting in of the winter rains,\r\nas the plain. There are no shady forests, no damp glens, at all like\r\nthose lying at the same elevations in the Coast Mountains. The social\r\ncompositae of the plain, with a few added species, form the bulk of the\r\nherbaceous portion of the vegetation up to a height of 1500 feet or\r\nmore, shaded lightly here and there with oaks and Sabine Pines, and\r\ninterrupted by patches of ceanothus and buckeye. Above this, and just\r\nbelow the forest region, there is a dark, heath-like belt of chaparral,\r\ncomposed almost exclusively of _Adenostoma fasciculata_, a bush\r\nbelonging to the rose family, from five to eight feet high, with small,\r\nround leaves in fascicles, and bearing a multitude of small white\r\nflowers in panicles on the ends of the upper branches. Where it occurs\r\nat all, it usually covers all the ground with a close, impenetrable\r\ngrowth, scarcely broken for miles.\r\n\r\nUp through the forest region, to a height of about 9000 feet above\r\nsea-level, there are ragged patches of manzanita, and five or six\r\nspecies of ceanothus, called deer-brush or California lilac. These are\r\nthe most important of all the honey-bearing bushes of the Sierra.\r\n_Chamaebatia foliolosa_, a little shrub about a foot high, with flowers\r\nlike the strawberry, makes handsome carpets beneath the pines, and\r\nseems to be a favorite with the bees; while pines themselves furnish\r\nunlimited quantities of pollen and honey-dew. The product of a single\r\ntree, ripening its pollen at the right time of year, would be\r\nsufficient for the wants of a whole hive. Along the streams there is a\r\nrich growth of lilies, larkspurs, pedicularis, castilleias, and clover.\r\nThe alpine region contains the flowery glacier meadows, and countless\r\nsmall gardens in all sorts of places full of potentilla of several\r\nspecies, spraguea, ivesia, epilobium, and goldenrod, with beds of\r\nbryanthus and the charming cassiope covered with sweet bells. Even the\r\ntops of the mountains are blessed with flowers,\xe2\x80\x94dwarf phlox,\r\npolemonium, ribes, hulsea, etc. I have seen wild bees and butterflies\r\nfeeding at a height of 13,000 feet above the sea. Many, however, that\r\ngo up these dangerous heights never come down again. Some, undoubtedly,\r\nperish in storms, and I have found thousands lying dead or benumbed on\r\nthe surface of the glaciers, to which they had perhaps been attracted\r\nby the white glare, taking them for beds of bloom.\r\n\r\nFrom swarms that escaped their owners in the lowlands, the honey-bee is\r\nnow generally distributed throughout the whole length of the Sierra, up\r\nto an elevation of 8000 feet above sea-level. At this height they\r\nflourish without care, though the snow every winter is deep. Even\r\nhigher than this several bee-trees have been cut which contained over\r\n200 pounds of honey.\r\n\r\nThe destructive action of sheep has not been so general on the mountain\r\npastures as on those of the great plain, but in many places it has been\r\nmore complete, owing to the more friable character of the soil, and its\r\nsloping position. The slant digging and down-raking action of hoofs on\r\nthe steeper slopes of moraines has uprooted and buried many of the\r\ntender plants from year to year, without allowing them time to mature\r\ntheir seeds. The shrubs, too, are badly bitten, especially the various\r\nspecies of ceanothus. Fortunately, neither sheep nor cattle care to\r\nfeed on the manzanita, spiraea, or adenostoma; and these fine\r\nhoney-bushes are too stiff and tall, or grow in places too rough and\r\ninaccessible, to be trodden under foot. Also the ca\xc3\xb1on walls and\r\ngorges, which form so considerable a part of the area of the range,\r\nwhile inaccessible to domestic sheep, are well fringed with\r\nhoney-shrubs, and contain thousands of lovely bee-gardens, lying hid in\r\nnarrow side-ca\xc3\xb1ons and recesses fenced with avalanche taluses, and on\r\nthe top of flat, projecting headlands, where only bees would think to\r\nlook for them.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, a great portion of the woody plants that escape\r\nthe feet and teeth of the sheep are destroyed by the shepherds by means\r\nof running fires, which are set everywhere during the dry autumn for\r\nthe purpose of burning off the old fallen trunks and underbrush, with a\r\nview to improving the pastures, and making more open ways for the\r\nflocks. These destructive sheep-fires sweep through nearly the entire\r\nforest belt of the range, from one extremity to the other, consuming\r\nnot only the underbrush, but the young trees and seedlings on which the\r\npermanence of the forests depends; thus setting in motion a long train\r\nof evils which will certainly reach far beyond bees and beekeepers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILD BEE GARDEN.]\r\n\r\nThe plow has not yet invaded the forest region to any appreciable\r\nextent, neither has it accomplished much in the foot-hills. Thousands\r\nof bee-ranches might be established along the margin of the plain, and\r\nup to a height of 4000 feet, wherever water could be obtained. The\r\nclimate at this elevation admits of the making of permanent homes, and\r\nby moving the hives to higher pastures as the lower pass out of bloom,\r\nthe annual yield of honey would be nearly doubled. The foot-hill\r\npastures, as we have seen, fail about the end of May, those of the\r\nchaparral belt and lower forests are in full bloom in June, those of\r\nthe upper and alpine region in July, August, and September. In\r\nScotland, after the best of the Lowland bloom is past, the bees are\r\ncarried in carts to the Highlands, and set free on the heather hills.\r\nIn France, too, and in Poland, they are carried from pasture to pasture\r\namong orchards and fields in the same way, and along the rivers in\r\nbarges to collect the honey of the delightful vegetation of the banks.\r\nIn Egypt they are taken far up the Nile, and floated slowly home again,\r\ngathering the honey-harvest of the various fields on the way, timing\r\ntheir movements in accord with the seasons. Were similar methods\r\npursued in California the productive season would last nearly all the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe average elevation of the north half of the Sierra is, as we have\r\nseen, considerably less than that of the south half, and small streams,\r\nwith the bank and meadow gardens dependent upon them, are less\r\nabundant. Around the head waters of the Yuba, Feather, and Pitt rivers,\r\nthe extensive tablelands of lava are sparsely planted with pines,\r\nthrough which the sunshine reaches the ground with little interruption.\r\nHere flourishes a scattered, tufted growth of golden applopappus,\r\nlinosyris, bahia, wyetheia, arnica, artemisia, and similar plants; with\r\nmanzanita, cherry, plum, and thorn in ragged patches on the cooler\r\nhill-slopes. At the extremities of the Great Central Plain, the Sierra\r\nand Coast Ranges curve around and lock together in a labyrinth of\r\nmountains and valleys, throughout which their floras are mingled,\r\nmaking at the north, with its temperate climate and copious rainfall, a\r\nperfect paradise for bees, though, strange to say, scarcely a single\r\nregular bee-ranch has yet been established in it.\r\n\r\nOf all the upper flower fields of the Sierra, Shasta is the most\r\nhoneyful, and may yet surpass in fame the celebrated honey hills of\r\nHybla and hearthy Hymettus. Regarding this noble mountain from a bee\r\npoint of view, encircled by its many climates, and sweeping aloft from\r\nthe torrid plain into the frosty azure, we find the first 5000 feet\r\nfrom the summit generally snow-clad, and therefore about as honeyless\r\nas the sea. The base of this arctic region is girdled by a belt of\r\ncrumbling lava measuring about 1000 feet in vertical breadth, and is\r\nmostly free from snow in summer. Beautiful lichens enliven the faces of\r\nthe cliffs with their bright colors, and in some of the warmer nooks\r\nthere are a few tufts of alpine daisies, wall-flowers and pentstemons;\r\nbut, notwithstanding these bloom freely in the late summer, the zone as\r\na whole is almost as honeyless as the icy summit, and its lower edge\r\nmay be taken as the honey-line. Immediately below this comes the forest\r\nzone, covered with a rich growth of conifers, chiefly Silver Firs, rich\r\nin pollen and honey-dew, and diversified with countless garden\r\nopenings, many of them less than a hundred yards across. Next, in\r\norderly succession, comes the great bee zone. Its area far surpasses\r\nthat of the icy summit and both the other zones combined, for it goes\r\nsweeping majestically around the entire mountain, with a breadth of six\r\nor seven miles and a circumference of nearly a hundred miles.\r\n\r\nShasta, as we have already seen, is a fire-mountain created by a\r\nsuccession of eruptions of ashes and molten lava, which, flowing over\r\nthe lips of its several craters, grew outward and upward like the trunk\r\nof a knotty exogenous tree. Then followed a strange contrast. The\r\nglacial winter came on, loading the cooling mountain with ice, which\r\nflowed slowly outward in every direction, radiating from the summit in\r\nthe form of one vast conical glacier\xe2\x80\x94a down-crawling mantle of ice upon\r\na fountain of smoldering fire, crushing and grinding for centuries its\r\nbrown, flinty lavas with incessant activity, and thus degrading and\r\nremodeling the entire mountain. When, at length, the glacial period\r\nbegan to draw near its close, the ice-mantle was gradually melted off\r\naround the bottom, and, in receding and breaking into its present\r\nfragmentary condition, irregular rings and heaps of moraine matter were\r\nstored upon its flanks. The glacial erosion of most of the Shasta lavas\r\nproduces detritus, composed of rough, sub-angular boulders of moderate\r\nsize and of porous gravel and sand, which yields freely to the\r\ntransporting power of running water. Magnificent floods from the ample\r\nfountains of ice and snow working with sublime energy upon this\r\nprepared glacial detritus, sorted it out and carried down immense\r\nquantities from the higher slopes, and reformed it in smooth,\r\ndelta-like beds around the base; and it is these flood-beds joined\r\ntogether that now form the main honey-zone of the old volcano.\r\n\r\nThus, by forces seemingly antagonistic and destructive, has Mother\r\nNature accomplished her beneficent designs\xe2\x80\x94now a flood of fire, now a\r\nflood of ice, now a flood of water; and at length an outburst of\r\norganic life, a milky way of snowy petals and wings, girdling the\r\nrugged mountain like a cloud, as if the vivifying sunbeams beating\r\nagainst its sides had broken into a foam of plant-bloom and bees, as\r\nsea-waves break and bloom on a rock shore.\r\n\r\nIn this flowery wilderness the bees rove and revel, rejoicing in the\r\nbounty of the sun, clambering eagerly through bramble and hucklebloom,\r\nringing the myriad bells of the manzanita, now humming aloft among\r\npolleny willows and firs, now down on the ashy ground among gilias and\r\nbuttercups, and anon plunging deep into snowy banks of cherry and\r\nbuckthorn. They consider the lilies and roll into them, and, like\r\nlilies, they toil not, for they are impelled by sun-power, as\r\nwater-wheels by water-power; and when the one has plenty of\r\nhigh-pressure water, the other plenty of sunshine, they hum and quiver\r\nalike. Sauntering in the Shasta bee-lands in the sun-days of summer,\r\none may readily infer the time of day from the comparative energy of\r\nbee-movements alone\xe2\x80\x94drowsy and moderate in the cool of the morning,\r\nincreasing in energy with the ascending sun, and, at high noon,\r\nthrilling and quivering in wild ecstasy, then gradually declining again\r\nto the stillness of night. In my excursions among the glaciers I\r\noccasionally meet bees that are hungry, like mountaineers who venture\r\ntoo far and remain too long above the bread-line; then they droop and\r\nwither like autumn leaves. The Shasta bees are perhaps better fed than\r\nany others in the Sierra. Their field-work is one perpetual feast; but,\r\nhowever exhilarating the sunshine or bountiful the supply of flowers,\r\nthey are always dainty feeders. Humming-moths and hummingbirds seldom\r\nset foot upon a flower, but poise on the wing in front of it, and reach\r\nforward as if they were sucking through straws. But bees, though, as\r\ndainty as they, hug their favorite flowers with profound cordiality,\r\nand push their blunt, polleny faces against them, like babies on their\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s bosom. And fondly, too, with eternal love, does Mother Nature\r\nclasp her small bee-babies, and suckle them, multitudes at once, on her\r\nwarm Shasta breast.\r\n\r\nBesides the common honey-bee there are many other species here\xe2\x80\x94fine\r\nmossy, burly fellows, who were nourished on the mountains thousands of\r\nsunny seasons before the advent of the domestic species. Among these\r\nare the bumblebees, mason-bees, carpenter-bees, and leaf-cutters.\r\nButterflies, too, and moths of every size and pattern; some\r\nbroad-winged like bats, flapping slowly, and sailing in easy curves;\r\nothers like small, flying violets, shaking about loosely in short,\r\ncrooked flights close to the flowers, feasting luxuriously night and\r\nday. Great numbers of deer also delight to dwell in the brushy portions\r\nof the bee-pastures.\r\n\r\nBears, too, roam the sweet wilderness, their blunt, shaggy forms\r\nharmonizing well with the trees and tangled bushes, and with the bees,\r\nalso, notwithstanding the disparity in size. They are fond of all good\r\nthings, and enjoy them to the utmost, with but little troublesome\r\ndiscrimination\xe2\x80\x94flowers and leaves as well as berries, and the bees\r\nthemselves as well as their honey. Though the California bears have as\r\nyet had but little experience with honeybees, they often succeed in\r\nreaching their bountiful stores, and it seems doubtful whether bees\r\nthemselves enjoy honey with so great a relish. By means of their\r\npowerful teeth and claws they can gnaw and tear open almost any hive\r\nconveniently accessible. Most honey-bees, however, in search of a home\r\nare wise enough to make choice of a hollow in a living tree, a\r\nconsiderable distance above the ground, when such places are to be had;\r\nthen they are pretty secure, for though the smaller black and brown\r\nbears climb well, they are unable to break into strong hives while\r\ncompelled to exert themselves to keep from falling, and at the same\r\ntime to endure the stings of the fighting bees without having their\r\npaws free to rub them off. But woe to the black bumblebees discovered\r\nin their mossy nests in the ground! With a few strokes of their huge\r\npaws the bears uncover the entire establishment, and, before time is\r\ngiven for a general buzz, bees old and young, larvae, honey, stings,\r\nnest, and all are taken in one ravishing mouthful.\r\n\r\nNot the least influential of the agents concerned in the superior\r\nsweetness of the Shasta flora are its storms\xe2\x80\x94storms I mean that are\r\nstrictly local, bred and born on the mountain. The magical rapidity\r\nwith which they are grown on the mountain-top, and bestow their charity\r\nin rain and snow, never fails to astonish the inexperienced lowlander.\r\nOften in calm, glowing days, while the bees are still on the wing, a\r\nstorm-cloud may be seen far above in the pure ether, swelling its pearl\r\nbosses, and growing silently, like a plant. Presently a clear, ringing\r\ndischarge of thunder is heard, followed by a rush of wind that comes\r\nsounding over the bending woods like the roar of the ocean, mingling\r\nraindrops, snow-flowers, honey-flowers, and bees in wild storm harmony.\r\n\r\nStill more impressive are the warm, reviving days of spring in the\r\nmountain pastures. The blood of the plants throbbing beneath the\r\nlife-giving sunshine seems to be heard and felt. Plant growth goes on\r\nbefore our eyes, and every tree in the woods, and every bush and flower\r\nis seen as a hive of restless industry. The deeps of the sky are\r\nmottled with singing wings of every tone and color; clouds of brilliant\r\nchrysididae dancing and swirling in exquisite rhythm, golden-barred\r\nvespidae, dragon-flies, butterflies, grating cicadas, and jolly,\r\nrattling grasshoppers, fairly enameling the light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY.\xe2\x80\x94WHITE SAGE.]\r\n\r\nOn bright, crisp mornings a striking optical effect may frequently be\r\nobserved from the shadows of the higher mountains while the sunbeams\r\nare pouring past overhead. Then every insect, no matter what may be its\r\nown proper color, burns white in the light. Gauzy-winged hymenoptera,\r\nmoths, jet-black beetles, all are transfigured alike in pure, spiritual\r\nwhite, like snowflakes.\r\n\r\nIn Southern California, where bee-culture has had so much skilful\r\nattention of late years, the pasturage is not more abundant, or more\r\nadvantageously varied as to the number of its honey-plants and their\r\ndistribution over mountain and plain, than that of many other portions\r\nof the State where the industrial currents flow in other channels. The\r\nfamous White Sage (_Audibertia_), belonging to the mint family,\r\nflourishes here in all its glory, blooming in May, and yielding great\r\nquantities of clear, pale honey, which is greatly prized in every\r\nmarket it has yet reached. This species grows chiefly in the valleys\r\nand low hills. The Black Sage on the mountains is part of a dense,\r\nthorny chaparral, which is composed chiefly of adenostoma, ceanothus,\r\nmanzanita, and cherry\xe2\x80\x94not differing greatly from that of the southern\r\nportion of the Sierra, but more dense and continuous, and taller, and\r\nremaining longer in bloom. Stream-side gardens, so charming a feature\r\nof both the Sierra and Coast Mountains, are less numerous in Southern\r\nCalifornia, but they are exceedingly rich in honey-flowers, wherever\r\nfound,\xe2\x80\x94melilotus, columbine, collinsia, verbena, zauschneria, wild\r\nrose, honeysuckle, philadelphus, and lilies rising from the warm, moist\r\ndells in a very storm of exuberance. Wild buckwheat of many species is\r\ndeveloped in abundance over the dry, sandy valleys and lower slopes of\r\nthe mountains, toward the end of summer, and is, at this time, the main\r\ndependence of the bees, reinforced here and there by orange groves,\r\nalfalfa fields, and small home gardens.\r\n\r\nThe main honey months, in ordinary seasons, are April, May, June, July,\r\nand August; while the other months are usually flowery enough to yield\r\nsufficient for the bees.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. J.T. Gordon, President of the Los Angeles County\r\nBee-keepers\xe2\x80\x99 Association, the first bees introduced into the county\r\nwere a single hive, which cost $150 in San Francisco, and arrived in\r\nSeptember, 1854.[1] In April, of the following year, this hive sent out\r\ntwo swarms, which were sold for $100 each. From this small beginning\r\nthe bees gradually multiplied to about 3000 swarms in the year 1873. In\r\n1876 it was estimated that there were between 15,000 and 20,000 hives\r\nin the county, producing an annual yield of about 100 pounds to the\r\nhive\xe2\x80\x94in some exceptional cases, a much greater yield.\r\n\r\nIn San Diego County, at the beginning of the season of 1878, there were\r\nabout 24,000 hives, and the shipments from the one port of San Diego\r\nfor the same year, from July 17 to November 10, were 1071 barrels,\r\n15,544 cases, and nearly 90 tons. The largest bee-ranches have about a\r\nthousand hives, and are carefully and skilfully managed, every\r\nscientific appliance of merit being brought into use. There are few\r\nbee-keepers, however, who own half as many as this, or who give their\r\nundivided attention to the business. Orange culture, at present, is\r\nheavily overshadowing every other business.\r\n\r\nA good many of the so-called bee-ranches of Los Angeles and San Diego\r\ncounties are still of the rudest pioneer kind imaginable. A man\r\nunsuccessful in everything else hears the interesting story of the\r\nprofits and comforts of bee-keeping, and concludes to try it; he buys a\r\nfew colonies, or gets them, from some overstocked ranch on shares,\r\ntakes them back to the foot of some ca\xc3\xb1on, where the pasturage is\r\nfresh, squats on the land, with, or without, the permission of the\r\nowner, sets up his hives, makes a box-cabin for himself, scarcely\r\nbigger than a bee-hive, and awaits his fortune.\r\n\r\nBees suffer sadly from famine during the dry years which occasionally\r\noccur in the southern and middle portions of the State. If the rainfall\r\namounts only to three or four inches, instead of from twelve to twenty,\r\nas in ordinary seasons, then sheep and cattle die in thousands, and so\r\ndo these small, winged cattle, unless they are carefully fed, or\r\nremoved to other pastures. The year 1877 will long be remembered as\r\nexceptionally rainless and distressing. Scarcely a flower bloomed on\r\nthe dry valleys away from the stream-sides, and not a single\r\ngrain-field depending upon rain was reaped. The seed only sprouted,\r\ncame up a little way, and withered. Horses, cattle, and sheep grew\r\nthinner day by day, nibbling at bushes and weeds, along the shallowing\r\nedges of streams, many of which were dried up altogether, for the first\r\ntime since the settlement of the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BEE-RANCH ON A SPUR OF THE SAN GABRIEL RANGE.\r\nCARDINAL FLOWER.]\r\n\r\nIn the course of a trip I made during the summer of that year through\r\nMonterey, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Los Angeles\r\ncounties, the deplorable effects of the drought were everywhere\r\nvisible\xe2\x80\x94leafless fields, dead and dying cattle, dead bees, and\r\nhalf-dead people with dusty, doleful faces. Even the birds and\r\nsquirrels were in distress, though their suffering was less painfully\r\napparent than that of the poor cattle. These were falling one by one in\r\nslow, sure starvation along the banks of the hot, sluggish streams,\r\nwhile thousands of buzzards correspondingly fat were sailing above\r\nthem, or standing gorged on the ground beneath the trees, waiting with\r\neasy faith for fresh carcasses. The quails, prudently considering the\r\nhard times, abandoned all thought of pairing. They were too poor to\r\nmarry, and so continued in flocks all through the year without\r\nattempting to rear young. The ground-squirrels, though an exceptionally\r\nindustrious and enterprising race, as every farmer knows, were hard\r\npushed for a living; not a fresh leaf or seed was to be found save in\r\nthe trees, whose bossy masses of dark green foliage presented a\r\nstriking contrast to the ashen baldness of the ground beneath them. The\r\nsquirrels, leaving their accustomed feeding-grounds, betook themselves\r\nto the leafy oaks to gnaw out the acorn stores of the provident\r\nwoodpeckers, but the latter kept up a vigilant watch upon their\r\nmovements. I noticed four woodpeckers in league against one squirrel,\r\ndriving the poor fellow out of an oak that they claimed. He dodged\r\nround the knotty trunk from side to side, as nimbly as he could in his\r\nfamished condition, only to find a sharp bill everywhere. But the fate\r\nof the bees that year seemed the saddest of all. In different portions\r\nof Los Angeles and San Diego counties, from one half to three fourths\r\nof them died of sheer starvation. Not less than 18,000 colonies\r\nperished in these two counties alone, while in the adjacent counties\r\nthe death-rate was hardly less.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILD BUCKWHEAT.\xe2\x80\x94A BEE RANCH IN THE WILDERNESS.]\r\n\r\nEven the colonies nearest to the mountains suffered this year, for the\r\nsmaller vegetation on the foot-hills was affected by the drought almost\r\nas severely as that of the valleys and plains, and even the hardy,\r\ndeep-rooted chaparral, the surest dependence of the bees, bloomed\r\nsparingly, while much of it was beyond reach. Every swarm could have\r\nbeen saved, however, by promptly supplying them with food when their\r\nown stores began to fail, and before they became enfeebled and\r\ndiscouraged; or by cutting roads back into the mountains, and taking\r\nthem into the heart of the flowery chaparral. The Santa Lucia, San\r\nRafael, San Gabriel, San Jacinto, and San Bernardino ranges are almost\r\nuntouched as yet save by the wild bees. Some idea of their resources,\r\nand of the advantages and disadvantages they offer to bee-keepers, may\r\nbe formed from an excursion that I made into the San Gabriel Range\r\nabout the beginning of August of \xe2\x80\x9cthe dry year.\xe2\x80\x9d This range, containing\r\nmost of the characteristic features of the other ranges just mentioned,\r\noverlooks the Los Angeles vineyards and orange groves from the north,\r\nand is more rigidly inaccessible in the ordinary meaning of the word\r\nthan any other that I ever attempted to penetrate. The slopes are\r\nexceptionally steep and insecure to the foot, and they are covered with\r\nthorny bushes from five to ten feet high. With the exception of little\r\nspots not visible in general views, the entire surface is covered with\r\nthem, massed in close hedge growth, sweeping gracefully down into every\r\ngorge and hollow, and swelling over every ridge and summit in shaggy,\r\nungovernable exuberance, offering more honey to the acre for half the\r\nyear than the most crowded clover-field. But when beheld from the open\r\nSan Gabriel Valley, beaten with dry sunshine, all that was seen of the\r\nrange seemed to wear a forbidding aspect. From base to summit all\r\nseemed gray, barren, silent, its glorious chaparral appearing like dry\r\nmoss creeping over its dull, wrinkled ridges and hollows.\r\n\r\nSetting out from Pasadena, I reached the foot of the range about\r\nsundown; and being weary and heated with my walk across the shadeless\r\nvalley, concluded to camp for the night. After resting a few moments, I\r\nbegan to look about among the flood-boulders of Eaton Creek for a\r\ncamp-ground, when I came upon a strange, dark-looking man who had been\r\nchopping cord-wood. He seemed surprised at seeing me, so I sat down\r\nwith him on the live-oak log he had been cutting, and made haste to\r\ngive a reason for my appearance in his solitude, explaining that I was\r\nanxious to find out something about the mountains, and meant to make my\r\nway up Eaton Creek next morning. Then he kindly invited me to camp with\r\nhim, and led me to his little cabin, situated at the foot of the\r\nmountains, where a small spring oozes out of a bank overgrown with\r\nwild-rose bushes. After supper, when the daylight was gone, he\r\nexplained that he was out of candles; so we sat in the dark, while he\r\ngave me a sketch of his life in a mixture of Spanish and English. He\r\nwas born in Mexico, his father Irish, his mother Spanish. He had been a\r\nminer, rancher, prospector, hunter, etc., rambling always, and wearing\r\nhis life away in mere waste; but now he was going to settle down. His\r\npast life, he said, was of \xe2\x80\x9cno account,\xe2\x80\x9d but the future was promising.\r\nHe was going to \xe2\x80\x9cmake money and marry a Spanish woman.\xe2\x80\x9d People mine\r\nhere for water as for gold. He had been running a tunnel into a spur of\r\nthe mountain back of his cabin. \xe2\x80\x9cMy prospect is good,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand if\r\nI chance to strike a good, strong flow, I\xe2\x80\x99ll soon be worth $5000 or\r\n$10,000. For that flat out there,\xe2\x80\x9d referring to a small, irregular\r\npatch of bouldery detritus, two or three acres in size, that had been\r\ndeposited by Eaton Creek during some flood season,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat flat is large\r\nenough for a nice orange-grove, and the bank behind the cabin will do\r\nfor a vineyard, and after watering my own trees and vines I will have\r\nsome water left to sell to my neighbors below me, down the valley. And\r\nthen,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI can keep bees, and make money that way, too,\r\nfor the mountains above here are just full of honey in the summer-time,\r\nand one of my neighbors down here says that he will let me have a whole\r\nlot of hives, on shares, to start with. You see I\xe2\x80\x99ve a good thing; I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nall right now.\xe2\x80\x9d All this prospective affluence in the sunken,\r\nboulder-choked flood-bed of a mountain-stream! Leaving the bees out of\r\nthe count, most fortune-seekers would as soon think of settling on the\r\nsummit of Mount Shasta. Next morning, wishing my hopeful entertainer\r\ngood luck, I set out on my shaggy excursion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BEE-PASTURE ON THE MORAINE DESERT, SPANISH BAYONET.]\r\n\r\nAbout half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s walk above the cabin, I came to \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fall,\xe2\x80\x9d famous\r\nthroughout the valley settlements as the finest yet discovered in the\r\nSan Gabriel Mountains. It is a charming little thing, with a low, sweet\r\nvoice, singing like a bird, as it pours from a notch in a short ledge,\r\nsome thirty-five or forty feet into a round mirror-pool. The face of\r\nthe cliff back of it, and on both sides, is smoothly covered and\r\nembossed with mosses, against which the white water shines out in showy\r\nrelief, like a silver instrument in a velvet case. Hither come the San\r\nGabriel lads and lassies, to gather ferns and dabble away their hot\r\nholidays in the cool water, glad to escape from their commonplace\r\npalm-gardens and orange-groves. The delicate maidenhair grows on\r\nfissured rocks within reach of the spray, while broad-leaved maples and\r\nsycamores cast soft, mellow shade over a rich profusion of bee-flowers,\r\ngrowing among boulders in front of the pool\xe2\x80\x94the fall, the flowers, the\r\nbees, the ferny rocks, and leafy shade forming a charming little poem\r\nof wildness, the last of a series extending down the flowery slopes of\r\nMount San Antonio through the rugged, foam-beaten bosses of the main\r\nEaton Canon.\r\n\r\nFrom the base of the fall I followed the ridge that forms the western\r\nrim of the Eaton basin to the summit of one of the principal peaks,\r\nwhich is about 5000 feet above sea-level. Then, turning eastward, I\r\ncrossed the middle of the basin, forcing a way over its many\r\nsubordinate ridges and across its eastern rim, having to contend almost\r\neverywhere with the floweriest and most impenetrable growth of\r\nhoney-bushes I had ever encountered since first my mountaineering\r\nbegan. Most of the Shasta chaparral is leafy nearly to the ground; here\r\nthe main stems are naked for three or four feet, and interspiked with\r\ndead twigs, forming a stiff _chevaux de frise_ through which even the\r\nbears make their way with difficulty. I was compelled to creep for\r\nmiles on all fours, and in following the bear-trails often found tufts\r\nof hair on the bushes where they had forced themselves through.\r\n\r\nFor 100 feet or so above the fall the ascent was made possible only by\r\ntough cushions of club-moss that clung to the rock. Above this the\r\nridge weathers away to a thin knife-blade for a few hundred yards, and\r\nthence to the summit of the range it carries a bristly mane of\r\nchaparral. Here and there small openings occur on rocky places,\r\ncommanding fine views across the cultivated valley to the ocean. These\r\nI found by the tracks were favorite outlooks and resting-places for the\r\nwild animals\xe2\x80\x94bears, wolves, foxes, wildcats, etc.\xe2\x80\x94which abound here,\r\nand would have to be taken into account in the establishment of\r\nbee-ranches. In the deepest thickets I found wood-rat villages\xe2\x80\x94groups\r\nof huts four to six feet high, built of sticks and leaves in rough,\r\ntapering piles, like musk-rat cabins. I noticed a good many bees, too,\r\nmost of them wild. The tame honey-bees seemed languid and wing-weary,\r\nas if they had come all the way up from the flowerless valley.\r\n\r\nAfter reaching the summit I had time to make only a hasty survey of the\r\nbasin, now glowing in the sunset gold, before hastening down into one\r\nof the tributary ca\xc3\xb1ons in search, of water. Emerging from a\r\nparticularly tedious breadth of chaparral, I found myself free and\r\nerect in a beautiful park-like grove of Mountain Live Oak, where the\r\nground was planted with aspidiums and brier-roses, while the glossy\r\nfoliage made a close canopy overhead, leaving the gray dividing trunks\r\nbare to show the beauty of their interlacing arches. The bottom of the\r\nca\xc3\xb1on was dry where I first reached it, but a bunch of scarlet mimulus\r\nindicated water at no great distance, and I soon discovered about a\r\nbucketful in a hollow of the rock. This, however, was full of dead\r\nbees, wasps, beetles, and leaves, well steeped and simmered, and would,\r\ntherefore, require boiling and filtering through fresh charcoal before\r\nit could be made available. Tracing the dry channel about a mile\r\nfarther down to its junction with a larger tributary ca\xc3\xb1on, I at length\r\ndiscovered a lot of boulder pools, clear as crystal, brimming full, and\r\nlinked together by glistening streamlets just strong enough to sing\r\naudibly. Flowers in full bloom adorned their margins, lilies ten feet\r\nhigh, larkspur, columbines, and luxuriant ferns, leaning and\r\noverarching in lavish abundance, while a noble old Live Oak spread its\r\nrugged arms over all. Here I camped, making my bed on smooth\r\ncobblestones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BEE-KEEPER\xe2\x80\x99S CABIN.\xe2\x80\x94BURRIELIA (ABOVE).\xe2\x80\x94MADIA (BELOW).]\r\n\r\nNext day, in the channel of a tributary that heads on Mount San\r\nAntonio, I passed about fifteen or twenty gardens like the one in which\r\nI slept\xe2\x80\x94lilies in every one of them, in the full pomp of bloom. My\r\nthird camp was made near the middle of the general basin, at the head\r\nof a long system of cascades from ten to 200 feet high, one following\r\nthe other in close succession down a rocky, inaccessible ca\xc3\xb1on, making\r\na total descent of nearly 1700 feet. Above the cascades the main stream\r\npasses through a series of open, sunny levels, the largest of which are\r\nabout an acre in size, where the wild bees and their companions were\r\nfeasting on a showy growth of zauschneria, painted cups, and\r\nmonardella; and gray squirrels were busy harvesting the burs of the\r\nDouglas Spruce, the only conifer I met in the basin.\r\n\r\nThe eastern slopes of the basin are in every way similar to those we\r\nhave described, and the same may be said of other portions of the\r\nrange. From the highest summit, far as the eye could reach, the\r\nlandscape was one vast bee-pasture, a rolling wilderness of\r\nhoney-bloom, scarcely broken by bits of forest or the rocky outcrops of\r\nhilltops and ridges.\r\n\r\nBehind the San Bernardino Range lies the wild \xe2\x80\x9csage-brush country,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbounded on the east by the Colorado River, and extending in a general\r\nnortherly direction to Nevada and along the eastern base of the Sierra\r\nbeyond Mono Lake.\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of this immense region, including Owen\xe2\x80\x99s Valley,\r\nDeath Valley, and the Sink of the Mohave, the area of which is nearly\r\none fifth that of the entire State, is usually regarded as a desert,\r\nnot because of any lack in the soil, but for want of rain, and rivers\r\navailable for irrigation. Very little of it, however, is desert in the\r\neyes of a bee.\r\n\r\nLooking now over all the available pastures of California, it appears\r\nthat the business of beekeeping is still in its infancy. Even in the\r\nmore enterprising of the southern counties, where so vigorous a\r\nbeginning has been made, less than a tenth of their honey resources\r\nhave as yet been developed; while in the Great Plain, the Coast Ranges,\r\nthe Sierra Nevada, and the northern region about Mount Shasta, the\r\nbusiness can hardly be said to exist at all. What the limits of its\r\ndevelopments in the future may be, with the advantages of cheaper\r\ntransportation and the invention of better methods in general, it is\r\nnot easy to guess. Nor, on the other hand, are we able to measure the\r\ninfluence on bee interests likely to follow the destruction of the\r\nforests, now rapidly falling before fire and the ax. As to the sheep\r\nevil, that can hardly become greater than it is at the present day. In\r\nshort, notwithstanding the wide-spread deterioration and destruction of\r\nevery kind already effected, California, with her incomparable climate\r\nand flora, is still, as far as I know, the best of all the bee-lands of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n [1] Fifteen hives of Italian bees were introduced into Los Angeles\r\n County in 1855, and in 1876 they had increased to 500. The marked\r\n superiority claimed for them over the common species is now attracting\r\n considerable attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MOUNTAINS OF CALIFORNIA ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
